6930-75918-0000	concord returned to its place amidst the tents
6930-75918-0001	the english footed to the french baskets of flowers of which they had made a plentiful provision to greet the arrival of the young princess the french in return invited the english to a supper which was to be given the next day
6930-75918-0002	congratulations were poured in upon the princess everywhere during her journey
6930-75918-0003	from the respect paid her on all sides she seemed like a queen and from the adoration with which she was treated by two or three she appeared an object of worship the queen mother gave the french the most affectionate reception france was her native country and she had suffered too much unhappiness in england for england to have made her forget france
6930-75918-0004	she taught her daughter then by her own affection for it that love for a country where they had both been hospitably received and where a brilliant future opened for them
6930-75918-0005	the count had thrown himself back on his seat leaning his shoulders against the partition of the tent and remained thus his face buried in his hands with heaving chest and restless limbs
6930-75918-0006	this has indeed been a harassing day continued the young man his eyes fixed upon his friend
6930-75918-0007	you will be frank with me i always am
6930-75918-0008	can you imagine why buckingham has been so violent i suspect
6930-75918-0009	it is you who are mistaken raoul i have read his distress in his eyes in his every gesture and action the whole day
6930-75918-0010	i can perceive love clearly enough
6930-75918-0011	i am convinced of what i say said the count
6930-75918-0012	it is annoyance then
6930-75918-0013	in those very terms i even added more
6930-75918-0014	but continued raoul not interrupted by this movement of his friend heaven be praised the french who are pronounced to be thoughtless and indiscreet reckless even are capable of bringing a calm and sound judgment to bear on matters of such high importance
6930-75918-0015	thus it is that the honor of three is saved our country our masters and our own
6930-75918-0016	yes i need repose many things have agitated me to day both in mind and body when you return to morrow i shall no longer be the same man
6930-75918-0017	but in this friendly pressure raw could detect the nervous agitation of a great internal conflict
6930-75918-0018	the night was clear starlit and splendid the tempest had passed away and the sweet influences of the evening had restored life peace and security everywhere
6930-75918-0019	upon the large square in front of the hotel the shadows of the tents intersected by the golden moonbeams formed as it were a huge mosaic of jet and yellow flagstones
6930-75918-0020	bragelonne watched for some time the conduct of the two lovers listened to the loud and uncivil slumbers of mannequin who snored as impiously as though he was wearing his blue and gold instead of his violet suit
6930-76324-0000	goliath makes another discovery
6930-76324-0001	They were certainly no near the solution of their problem
6930-76324-0002	the poor little things cried cynthia think of them having been turned to the wall all these years
6930-76324-0003	now what is the sense of it two innocent babies like that
6930-76324-0004	but joyce had not been listening all at once she put down her candle on the table and faced her companion
6930-76324-0005	the twin brother did something she didn't like and she turned his picture to the wall
6930-76324-0006	hers happened to be on the same frame too but she evidently didn't care about it
6930-76324-0007	now what have you to say cynthia sproug
6930-76324-0008	i thought we were stumped again when i first saw that picture but it's been of some use after all
6930-76324-0009	do you suppose the mentimeter was a copy of the same thing
6930-76324-0010	what in the world is it queried joyce
6930-76324-0011	they worried me terribly and besides i'd like to see what this lovely furniture looks like without such quantities of dust all over it good scheme sin
6930-76324-0012	we'll come in here this afternoon with old clothes on and have a regular house cleaning
6930-76324-0013	it can't hurt anything i'm sure for we won't disturb things at all
6930-76324-0014	this thought however did not enter the heads of the enthusiastic pair
6930-76324-0015	smuggling the house cleaning paraphernalia into the cellar window unobserved that afternoon proved no easy task for cynthia had added a whisk broom and dust pan to the outfit
6930-76324-0016	the lure proved too much for him and he came sporting after it as friskily as a young kitten much to cynthia's delight when she caught sight of him
6930-76324-0017	oh let him come along she urged i do love to see him about that old house
6930-76324-0018	he makes it sort of cozier
6930-76324-0019	now let's dust the furniture and pictures
6930-76324-0020	yet little as it was it had already made a vast difference in the aspect of the room
6930-76324-0021	surface dusk at least had been removed and the fine old furniture gave a hint of its real elegance and polish
6930-76324-0022	then she suddenly remarked
6930-76324-0023	and my pocket money is getting low again and you haven't any left as usual
6930-76324-0024	they say illumination by candle light is the prettiest in the world
6930-76324-0025	why it's goliath as usual they both cried peering in
6930-76324-0026	isn't he the greatest for getting into odd corners
6930-76324-0027	forgetting all their weariness they seized their candles and scurried through the house finding on occasional paper tucked away in some odd corner
6930-76324-0028	well i'm convinced that the boarded up house mystery happened not earlier than april sixteenth eighteen sixty one and probably not much later
6930-81414-0000	no words were spoken no language was uttered save that of wailing and hissing and that somehow was indistinct as if it existed in fancy and not in reality
6930-81414-0001	i heard a noise behind i turned and saw kaffir his black eyes shining while in his hand he held a gleaming knife he lifted it above his head as if to strike but i had the strength of ten men and i hurled him from me
6930-81414-0002	onward said a distant voice
6930-81414-0003	no sound broke the stillness of the night
6930-81414-0004	the story of its evil influence came back to me and in my bewildered condition i wondered whether there was not some truth in what had been said
6930-81414-0005	what was that
6930-81414-0006	what then a human hand large and shapely appeared distinctly on the surface of the pond
6930-81414-0007	nothing more not even the wrist to which it might be attached
6930-81414-0008	it did not beckon or indeed move at all it was as still as the hand of death
6930-81414-0009	i awoke to consciousness fighting at first it seemed as if i was fighting with the phantom but gradually my opponent became more real to me it was capper
6930-81414-0010	a sound of voices a flash of light
6930-81414-0011	a feeling of freedom and i was awake where
6930-81414-0012	said another voice which i recognized as voltaire's capper
6930-81414-0013	i had scarcely known what i had been saying or doing up to this time but as he spoke i looked at my hand
6930-81414-0014	in the light of the moon i saw a knife red with blood and my hand too was also discolored
6930-81414-0015	i do not know i am dazed bewildered
6930-81414-0016	but that is kaffir's knife
6930-81414-0017	i know he had it this very evening
6930-81414-0018	i remembered saying have we been together
6930-81414-0019	voltaire picked up something from the ground and looked at it
6930-81414-0020	i say you do know what this means and you must tell us
6930-81414-0021	a terrible thought flashed into my mind
6930-81414-0022	i had again been acting under the influence of this man's power
6930-81414-0023	perchance too kaffir's death might serve him in good stead
6930-81414-0024	my tongue refused to articulate my power of speech left me
6930-81414-0025	my position was too terrible
6930-81414-0026	my over wrought nerves yielded at last
6930-81414-0027	for some time after that i remembered nothing distinctly
1320-122617-0000	notwithstanding the high resolution of hawkeye he fully comprehended all the difficulties and danger he was about to encounter
1320-122617-0001	in his return to the camp his acute and practised intellects were intensely engaged in devising means to counteract a watchfulness and suspicion on the part of his enemies that he knew were in no degree inferior to his own
1320-122617-0002	in other words while he had implicit faith in the ability of baalam's ass to speak he was somewhat sceptical on the subject of a bear's singing and yet he had been assured of the latter on the testimony of his own exquisite organs
1320-122617-0003	there was something in his air and manner that betrayed to the scout the utter confusion of the state of his mind
1320-122617-0004	the ingenious hawkeye who recalled the hasty manner in which the other had abandoned his post at the bedside of the sick woman was not without his suspicions concerning the subject of so much solemn deliberation
1320-122617-0005	the bear shook his shaggy sides and then a well known voice replied
1320-122617-0006	can these things be returned david breathing more freely as the truth began to dawn upon him
1320-122617-0007	come come returned hawkeye uncasing his honest countenance the better to assure the wavering confidence of his companion you may see a skin which if it be not as white as one of the gentle ones has no tinge of red to it that the winds of the heaven and the sun have not bestowed now let us to business
1320-122617-0008	the young man is in bondage and much i fear his death is decreed
1320-122617-0009	i greatly mourn that one so well disposed should die in his ignorance and i have sought a goodly hymn can you lead me to him
1320-122617-0010	the task will not be difficult returned david hesitating though i greatly fear your presence would rather increase than mitigate his unhappy fortunes
1320-122617-0011	the lodge in which uncas was confined was in the very centre of the village and in a situation perhaps more difficult than any other to approach or leave without observation
1320-122617-0012	four or five of the latter only lingered about the door of the prison of uncas weary but close observers of the manner of their captive
1320-122617-0013	delivered in a strong tone of ascent announced the gratification the savage would receive in witnessing such an exhibition of weakness in an enemy so long hated and so much feared
1320-122617-0014	they drew back a little from the entrance and motioned to the supposed conjurer to enter
1320-122617-0015	but the bear instead of obeying maintained the seat it had taken and growled
1320-122617-0016	the cunning man is afraid that his breath will blow upon his brothers and take away their courage too continued david improving the hint he received they must stand further off
1320-122617-0017	then as if satisfied of their safety the scout left his position and slowly entered the place
1320-122617-0018	it was silent and gloomy being tenanted solely by the captive and lighted by the dying embers of a fire which had been used for the purpose of cookery
1320-122617-0019	uncas occupied a distant corner in a reclining attitude being rigidly bound both hands and feet by strong and painful wythes
1320-122617-0020	the scout who had left david at the door to ascertain they were not observed thought it prudent to preserve his disguise until assured of their privacy
1320-122617-0021	what shall we do with the mingos at the door they count six and the singer is as good as nothing
1320-122617-0022	the delawares are children of the tortoise and they outstrip the deer
1320-122617-0023	uncus who had already approached the door in readiness to lead the way now recoiled and placed himself once more in the bottom of the lodge
1320-122617-0024	but hackeey who was too much occupied with his own thoughts to note the movement continued speaking more to himself than to his companion
1320-122617-0025	so uncas you had better take the lead while i will put on the skin again and trust to cunning for want of speed
1320-122617-0026	well what can't be done by main courage and war must be done by circumvention
1320-122617-0027	as soon as these dispositions were made the scout turned to david and gave him his parting instructions
1320-122617-0028	my pursuits are peaceful and my temper i humbly trust is greatly given to mercy and love returned david a little nettled at so direct an attack on his manhood but there are none who can say that i have ever forgotten my faith in the lord even in the greatest straits
1320-122617-0029	if you are not then knocked on the head your being a non compos mentis will protect you and you'll then have a good reason to expect to die in your bed
1320-122617-0030	so choose for yourself to make a rush or tarry here
1320-122617-0031	bravely and generously has he battled in my behalf and this and more will i dare in his service
1320-122617-0032	keep silent as long as may be and it would be wise when you do speak to break out suddenly in one of your shoutings which will serve to remind the indians that you are not altogether as responsible as men should be
1320-122617-0033	if however they take your scalp as i trust and believe they will not depend on it uncas and i will not forget the deed but revenge it as becomes true warriors and trusty friends
1320-122617-0034	hold said david perceiving that with this assurance they were about to leave him i am an unworthy and humble follower of one who taught not the damnable principle of revenge
1320-122617-0035	then heaving a heavy sigh probably among the last he ever drew in pining for a condition he had so long abandoned he added it is what i would wish to practise myself as one without a cross of blood though it is not always easy to deal with an indian as you would with a fellow christian
1320-122617-0036	god bless you friend i do believe your sent is not greatly wrong when the matter is duly considered and keeping eternity before the eyes though much depends on the natural gifts and the force of temptation
1320-122617-0037	the delaware dog he said leaning forward and peering through the dim light to catch the expression of the other's features is he afraid
1320-122617-0038	will the herons hear his groans
1320-122617-0039	the mohican started on his feet and shook his shaggy covering as though the animal he counterfeited was about to make some desperate effort
1320-122617-0040	he had no occasion to delay for at the next instant a burst of cries filled the outer air and ran along the whole extent of the village
1320-122617-0041	uncas cast his skin and stepped forth in his own beautiful proportions
1320-122612-0000	since the period of our tale the active spirit of the country has surrounded it with a belt of rich and thriving settlements though none but the hunter or the savage is ever known even now to penetrate its wild recesses
1320-122612-0001	the dews were suffered to exhale and the sun had dispersed the mists and was shedding a strong and clear light in the forests when the travellers resumed their journey
1320-122612-0002	after proceeding a few miles the progress of hakkai who led the advance became more deliberate and watchful
1320-122612-0003	he often stopped to examine the trees nor did he cross a rivulet without attentively considering the quantity the velocity and the color of its waters
1320-122612-0004	distrusting his own judgment his appeals to the opinion of chingachgook were frequent and earnest
1320-122612-0005	yet here are we within a short range of the schooners and not a sign of a trail have we crossed
1320-122612-0006	let us retrace our steps and examine as we go with keener eyes
1320-122612-0007	chingachgook had caught the look and motioning with his hand he bade him speak
1320-122612-0008	the eyes of the whole party followed the unexpected movement and read their success in the air of triumph that the youth assumed
1320-122612-0009	it would have been more wonderful had he spoken without a biting
1320-122612-0010	see said uncas pointing north and south at the evident marks of the broad trail on either side of him the dark hair has gone toward the forest
1320-122612-0011	if a rock or a rivulet or a bit of earth harder than common severed the links of the clew they followed the true eye of the scout recovered them at a distance and seldom rendered the delay of a single moment necessary
1320-122612-0012	exquisite brands were lying around a spring the offals of a deer were scattered about the place and the trees bore evident marks of having been browsed by the horses
1320-122612-0013	a circle of a few hundred feet in circumference was drawn and each of the party took a segment for his portion
1320-122612-0014	the examination however resulted in no discovery
1320-122612-0015	the whole party crowded to the spot where uncas pointed out the impression of a moccasin in the moist alluvion
1320-122612-0016	run back uncus and bring me the size of the singer's foot
5639-40744-0000	eleven o'clock had struck it was a fine clear night they were the only persons on the road and they sauntered leisurely along to avoid paying the price of fatigue for the recreation provided for the tledons in the valley or on the banks of the river
5639-40744-0001	secure as he thought in the careful administration of justice in that city and the character of its well disposed inhabitants the good hidalgo was far from thinking that any disaster could befall his family
5639-40744-0002	rudolpho and his companions with their faces muffled in their cloaks stared rudely and insolently at the mother the daughter and the servant maid
5639-40744-0003	in a moment he communicated his thoughts to his companions and in the next moment they resolved to turn back and carry her off to please rudolph for the rich who are open handed always find parasites and thus to conceive this wicked design to communicate it approve on ravishing leocadia and to carry that design into effect was the work of a moment
5639-40744-0004	they drew their swords hid their faces in the flaps of their cloaks turned back and soon came in front of the little party who had not yet done giving thanks to god for their escape from those odacious men
5639-40744-0005	finally the one party went off exulting and the other was left in desolation and woe
5639-40744-0006	rudolfo arrived at his own house without any impediment and leokadia's parents reached theirs heart broken and despairing
5639-40744-0007	meanwhile rudolpho had leocadia safe in his custody and in his own apartment
5639-40744-0008	who touches me am i in bed
5639-40744-0009	mother dear father do you hear me
5639-40744-0010	it is the only amends i ask of you for the wrong you have done me
5639-40744-0011	she found the door but it was locked outside
5639-40744-0012	she succeeded in opening the window and the moonlight shone in so brightly that she could distinguish the color of some damask hanging in the room
5639-40744-0013	she saw that the bed was gilded and so rich that it seemed that of a prince rather than of a private gentleman
5639-40744-0014	among other things on which she cast her eyes was a small crucifix of solid silver standing on a cabinet near the window
5639-40744-0015	this person was rudolpho who though he had gone to look for his friends had changed his mind in that respect not thinking it advisable to acquaint them with what had passed between him and the girl
5639-40744-0016	on the contrary he resolved to tell them that repenting of his violence and moved by her tears he had only carried her half way towards his house and then let her go
5639-40744-0017	choking with emotion lucia made a sign to her parents that she wished to be alone with them
5639-40744-0018	that would be very well my child replied her father if your plan were not liable to be frustrated by ordinary cunning but no doubt this image had been already missed by its owner and he will have set it down for certain that it was taken out of the room by the person he locked up there
5639-40744-0019	what you had best do my child is to keep it and pray to it that since it was a witness to your undoing it will deign to vindicate your cause by its righteous judgment
5639-40744-0020	thus did the humane and right minded father comfort his unhappy daughter and her mother embracing her again did all she could to soothe the feelings
5639-40744-0021	she meanwhile passed her life with her parents in the strictest retirement never letting herself be seen but shunning every eye lest it should read her misfortune in her face
5639-40744-0022	time rolled on the hour of her delivery arrived it took place in the utmost secrecy her mother taking upon her the office of midwife as she gave birth to a son one of the most beautiful ever seen
5639-40744-0023	when the boy walked through the streets blessings were showered upon him by all who saw him blessing upon his beauty upon the mother that bore him upon the father that begot him upon those who brought him up so well
5639-40744-0024	one day when the boy was sent by his grandfather with a message to a relation he passed along a street in which there was a great concourse of horsemen
5639-40744-0025	the bed she too well remembered was there and above all the cabinet on which had stood the image she had taken away was still on the same spot
5639-40744-0026	louis was out of danger in a fortnight in a month he rose from his bed and during all that time he was visited daily by his mother and grandmother and treated by the master and mistress of the house as if he was their own child
5639-40744-0027	thus saying and pressing the crucifix to her breast she fell fainting into the arms of donna isafana who as a gentlewoman to whose sex pity is a natural as cruelty as to man instantly pressed her lips to those of the fainting girl shedding over her so many tears that there needed no other sprinkling of water to recover oquita from her swoon
5639-40744-0028	i have great things to tell you senor said donna isabella to her husband the cream and substance of which is this the fainting girl before you is your daughter and the boy is your grandson
5639-40744-0029	this truth which i have learned from her lips is confirmed by his face in which we have both beheld that of our son
5639-40744-0030	just then leocadia came to herself and embracing the cross seemed changed into a sea of tears and the gentleman remaining in utter bewilderment until his wife had repeated to him from beginning to end leocadia's whole story and he believed it through the blessed dispensation of heaven which had confirmed it by so many convincing testimonies
5639-40744-0031	so persuasive were her entreaties and so strong her assurances that no harm whatever could result to them from the information she sought they were induced to confess that one summer's night the same she had mentioned themselves and another friend being out on a stroll with rodolfo they had been concerned in the abduction of a girl whom rodolfo carried off whilst the rest of them detained her family who made a great outcry and would have defended her if they could
5639-40744-0032	for god's sake my lady mother give me a wife who would be an agreeable companion not one who will disgust me so that we may both bear evenly and with mutual good will the yoke imposed on us by heaven instead of pulling this way and that way and fretting each other to death
5639-40744-0033	her bearing was graceful and animated she led her son by the hand and before her walked two maids with wax lights and silver candlesticks
5639-40744-0034	all rose to do her reverence as if something from heaven had miraculously appeared before them but gazing on her entranced with admiration not one of them was able to address a single word to her
5639-40744-0035	she reflected how near she stood to the crisis which was to determine whether she was to be blessed or unhappy for ever and racked by the intensity of her emotions she suddenly changed colour her head dropped and she fell forward in a swoon into the arms of the dismayed stephania
5639-40744-0036	his mother had left her to him as being her destined protector but when she saw that he too was insensible she was near making a third and would have done so had he not come to himself
5639-40744-0037	know then son of my heart that this fainting lady is your real bride i say real because she is the one whom your father and i have chosen for you and the portrait was a portrait
