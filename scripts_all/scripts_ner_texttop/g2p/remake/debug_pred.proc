POD1000000011_S0000097	that is right and at the pre school we sat down with one of the lead researchers sue swaminathan and she helped us understand a lot more about how to grow children who love math
POD1000000011_S0000099	instead swaminathan says think small she is a professor in early childhood education at eastern connecticut state and her special focus is on early math learning
POD1000000011_S0000100	and sudha and her colleagues have done lots of research to see what kinds of childhood experiences lead to better performance in math later on

POD1000000012_S0000161	rosemarie explained that self regulation is not just about treaties self regulation is a set of skills that helps us reach our goals
POD1000000012_S0000185	but ken fujita who we heard from earlier who said cookie monster was a maniac
POD1000000012_S0000190	so by software ken is talking about the skills and the strategies that parents can help kids practice to improve their self regulation
POD1000000012_S0000234	just like i did with cookie monster i know it was silly and probably sounded a little ridiculous
POD1000000012_S0000258	the experiment has been repeated many many times since it was 1st done by walter mischel in the late 1960s
POD1000000012_S0000263	and by hot ken fujita means intense or urgent something that you want to act on right now but he says

POD1000000016_S0000147	the civil war has been going on for about a year and abraham lincoln is worried because the war is not going well and because it is not going well he is feeling like he might have to do something drastic
POD1000000016_S0000172	and to make it even worse lincoln then tells them that it is their fault that the country is fighting a civil war at all
POD1000000016_S0000183	after everything that black americans have been through in this country that they did not immediately take up lincoln is offer and go somewhere else and start over is really an astounding testimony to their belief in the american ideals

POD1000000016_S0000251	would find that this actually made them a target of some of the most severe violence but what was unusual was what happened after
POD1000000019_S0000021	billy swan is one jeannie c riley the singer of harper valley pta is the other one those are the only 2 people alive who have had their 1st single go number one country and pop

POD1000000019_S0000051	jeannie c riley is auto biography is really the only source i can use for this stuff and it is super scatchy to say the least
POD1000000019_S0000065	in the very next paragraph she says she would already studied the lyrics which she would have gotten from shelby why does she have shelby presenting the lyrics to her here with such pomp as if for the very 1st time
POD1000000019_S0000074	if they will come by the office of sharefire his publishing company a few days later they drop in to the sharefire office and meet johnny russell who is a staff songwriter there johnny russell listens to her sing
POD1000000019_S0000075	they decide to have her go in the studio that night and the next to record a 4 song demo tape they have a photographer take some pictures of her jeannie thinks all of this means she is on her way to becoming a star
POD1000000019_S0000084	as they cross the city limit sign into nashville she and micky make a pack that they will always travel together as a family the baby too quote show business might chew up other folks and spit them onto the sidwalk but not us we would show
POD1000000019_S0000090	based out of new york phil blackman is our big bad wolf well uncle johnny bought a gas station right before genie and micky moved to nashville so that is where micky starts working
POD1000000019_S0000095	25 miles away from where jeanie was from she apparently thinks she can meet this lady say hey i am from texas too and get a record deal or something
POD1000000019_S0000096	she has no idea where this lady is office is supposed to be she just starts walking into publishing companies to find out if that lady works there or not when some kid asked if she is trying to get a demo tape heard jeannie pulls out her tape and the kid takes a listen
POD1000000019_S0000097	he seems to like it plays it for his boss who says it sounds too much like loretta lynn and they tell jeanie to kick rocks she goes back to her car with the baby and cries then decides to drive over to the gas station where micky works
POD1000000019_S0000104	but jerry thinks they can get monitor to back off the name change if they stay on it jeanie gets shown off at a dj convention introduced to everyone in town as tina stevens the next girl they are going to sign and do big things with
POD1000000019_S0000107	remember this sentence that dj paul perry sends jeannie is demo and a promo picture to phil blackman in new york city
POD1000000019_S0000115	then one day in blackman is apartment jeannie is laying naked on the couch after having sex with him when she is suddenly blinded by flashes of bright light there is blackman holding a camera with a strobe flash attachment
POD1000000019_S0000126	he hires jeannie as a secretary which is where she is working when a song writer friend asked her to sing on the demo of his new song he wants shelby singleton at plantation records to hear
POD1000000019_S0000127	i could not find a recording of genie singing it but i found the songwriter singing it himself so you can try to imagine what genie would have sounded like on the demo
POD1000000019_S0000128	clark bentley is old town drunk comes out on plantation records in 1968
POD1000000019_S0000135	she is thinking about that when perry says if jeannie does not take this deal then he can not represent her anymore it is not going to get any better than this she signs the papers goes home and cries about it
POD1000000019_S0000141	shelby tells jeanie they will use her middle initial to make her stand out more from the other jeannie and add an eye to her 1st name so people know it is not pronounced gene
POD1000000019_S0000142	finding out she really does not have to be rhonda renae plus the fact that everyone in the room seems certain she just cut a massive hit song improves jeannie is mood
POD1000000019_S0000151	when she finds out she is the one paying for all of that genie and mickey do not need help spending the money they are throwing down major cash on clothing jewelry hairstyles cars all the usual rock star stuff
POD1000000019_S0000155	anyway pretty soon jeannie starts spending too much time with her manager paul perry one night they are sitting around holding hands and paul is talking about how careful jeannie has to be now that she is on top
POD1000000019_S0000159	made from her old sessions with him now that jeannie has got the biggest hit in the nation these records will sell
POD1000000019_S0000161	blackman has got a manilla envelope like you see in every movie about a private detective and he wants to give it to jeanie but 1st she has got to sign a new piece of paper saying she will not sue him for releasing her old recordings
POD1000000019_S0000170	which is also the explanation for why jeannie would be in los vegas opening up for johnny paycheck when all she is supposedly done is one barely released single for black rose records
POD1000000019_S0000184	something physical for jeanne to play percent with to keep the whole shareaded going it was called you write the music credited to jean riley quote unquote released on little darling records in 1967
POD1000000019_S0000188	now here are the 2 big questions i do not think i can or should even try to answer did aubrey mayhew and jeannie c riley have an affair
POD1000000019_S0000201	she gets to pick wild mountain berries with glen campbell on tv
POD1000000019_S0000208	if you are starting to get the idea that jeannie is always thought of as little more than a puppet for the people behind the scenes of her career i would say that seems accurate
POD1000000019_S0000213	and while the song is actually sung by the daughter character who does not dress that way every time you see jeannie c riley she looks like missis johnson
POD1000000019_S0000228	from the nightmare she describes you would expect that to be the only time she ever toked up but this video clip of ralph emery interviewing her seems to suggest otherwise
POD1000000019_S0000234	the only other woman to do that in the 1900s is dolly parton with 9 to 5 in 1981 making jeanne the 1st woman to ever do it if you do not count the fart with little darling records
POD1000000019_S0000252	here is her doing it on the johnny cash show
POD1000000019_S0000261	like the ella times pop critic robert hilburn who reviewed a gnnc riley concert in 1971 under the headline little talent
POD1000000019_S0000268	she always had a crack band behind her the harper valley express they usually made the tempo of everything faster to really put some gas in the tank and it is impossible to deny jenni is carisma as a performer
POD1000000019_S0000274	not only was jeannie not a one hit wonder she made good albums with very little filler check out this album track from 1972 never even released as a single called without you called without you
POD1000000019_S0000277	without you is from genie is 2nd album on mgm after leaving plantation records in 1972 in what shelby singleton called a breach of contract
POD1000000019_S0000291	the exact opposite audience of the only reason anyone knows jeannie c riley is name harper valley pta a song highly critical of hypocrisy in social groups with hardcore conservative values
POD1000000019_S0000301	next move ask tom t hall to write another harper valley pta a thing he had been very vocal about his reluctance to do but also he is a big softie
POD1000000019_S0000355	and that disclaimer is written by jeannie is co author who i also failed to mention is a premiere here is what he writes quote to keep from hurting some of the folks jeannie loves we have changed the names of several people in the book
POD1000000019_S0000374	one thing that is really interesting that we heard today is unlike as you heard in the 2nd episode of the podcast loretta lynn is recording of the pill
POD1000000019_S0000378	i think money talks i think that by the time any of those would be buzz kills started paying attention this song was already the number one pop song in america and it went number one pop before it went number one country
POD1000000019_S0000379	every major record label in nashville had been falling all over itself for 15 years trying to do that they would have made jeannie c riley the mayor of nashville if she did it a 2nd time
POD1000000019_S0000387	than 2 years later in 1971 as genie stated in the book this is really aggravating for me to have to talk about right now because this is just my fault
POD1000000021_S0000006	that is trina edwards we were talking about her husband edwin edwards the former governor of louisiana
POD1000000021_S0000018	edward served 8 years on correction charges
POD1000000021_S0000042	there were 6 grand jury investigations during edward is 1st term
POD1000000021_S0000046	edwards led louisiana for 8 years leaving office in march 1980
POD1000000021_S0000047	the only thing stopping him from being governor for life were term limits that edwards himself had pushed for
POD1000000021_S0000058	edwards was right to believe that 1983 election was a lock he would win it with 62% of the vote
POD1000000021_S0000061	if there is one thing louisiana governor elect edward edwards knows it is how to have a good time even with a $40 campaign deposit stering him down
POD1000000021_S0000062	edwards charted 2 jumbo jets announced he was going to paris and invited anyone willing to contribute $10000 to come on along
POD1000000021_S0000096	when i asked edwards about the case he did not sound all that sorry
POD1000000021_S0000111	buddy romer was a congressman from north louisiana
POD1000000021_S0000121	there would be no run off roger
POD1000000021_S0000123	but that is not how edward saw it dropping out of the race that was the 1st step in his comeback plan
POD1000000021_S0000133	in 1991 david duke was at the height of his powers
POD1000000021_S0000137	this is slow burn i am josh levine episode 5 the road to helsinki
POD1000000021_S0000140	that is exactly what simply safe has been a decade fighting against
POD1000000021_S0000148	simply safe was named best overall home security of 2020 by us news and world report
POD1000000021_S0000153	it was 1930 and the governor was huey long
POD1000000021_S0000157	long was shot and killed at the state capitol 5 years later
POD1000000021_S0000159	yes long was a corrupt dictator and sure he orchestrated a kidnapping
POD1000000021_S0000161	edwin edwards carried on huey long is tradition of economic populism
POD1000000021_S0000162	like long edwards used money snatched from big oil to build bridges and hospitals
POD1000000021_S0000167	in reality duke is brand of populism had nothing to do with shrinking government
POD1000000021_S0000169	duke is message the journalist john mcginnis wrote held a lot of appeal for the children and grandchildren of huey long is old voters
POD1000000021_S0000172	they want to see where elon was shot and where david duke sits
POD1000000021_S0000181	roger is big initiative was a plan to modernize the states approach to taxation
POD1000000021_S0000184	roger was adequate that his fiscal reform plan was not a tax increase
POD1000000021_S0000187	david duke then a newly elected state legislator was one of the governor is most outspoken critics
POD1000000021_S0000197	digging louisiana is already troubled economy ever deeper in debt and forcing reform minded governor buddy roger to scranmble his way out of a new financial crisis
POD1000000021_S0000206	but strother who would helped roger win in 1987 was available to work on the governor is real election campaign
POD1000000021_S0000219	roger actually liked the rubber band idea
POD1000000021_S0000225	in his state of the state address roger apologizes to the legislator for his inflexibility and insensitivity
POD1000000021_S0000228	for strother the self help stuff was bad but what happened next was worse
POD1000000021_S0000231	i saw mary mattlen a whole bunch of high school republicans sitting around the table with by the dining room table with buddy
POD1000000021_S0000242	adiology aside roger thought the move was smart strategy
POD1000000021_S0000243	edwin edwards was going to grab votes from his left no matter what
POD1000000021_S0000244	roger figured that branding himself a republican would help save off right wing challenges who might threaten his reelection
POD1000000021_S0000245	the statewide poll showed that the top 3 candidates are doug edwards and myself
POD1000000021_S0000250	democrats in louisiana felt burnt by roger and republicans including state party officials were not sure they could trust him either
POD1000000021_S0000252	resented that roger had not included him in discussions about the party switch and roger forgetting the lessons of all i ever needed to know i learned in kindergarten cursed out nungusser rather than trying to appease him
POD1000000021_S0000254	that endorsement would not go to buddy roger or david duke
POD1000000021_S0000260	then duke was agging them on you know to disrupt things
POD1000000021_S0000263	yeah yeah
POD1000000021_S0000296	by 1991 the open primary was open in a way edwards maybe had not anticipated
POD1000000021_S0000305	duke could pass the bucket with impunity during his 1990 senate campaign because that was a federal race
POD1000000021_S0000307	ham strong by these new rules duke held fewer rallies as a candidate for governor than when he ran for the senate and edwards is fundraising slowed to a trickle
POD1000000021_S0000312	raymond strother saw it up close during the 1987 race
POD1000000021_S0000326	the problem for roger was that a lot of swing voters felt drawn to another candidate
POD1000000021_S0000343	it was not clear based on pulling how white people in louisiana were responding to duke is latest attempt at image management
POD1000000021_S0000344	susan howell had been struggling for years to get a handle on duke is voters
POD1000000021_S0000355	this became a research challenge for howell and her graduate students how could they get david duke silent army to break its silence
POD1000000021_S0000365	romer is political consultant raymond strother heard that speculation
POD1000000021_S0000373	when i got edwards on the phone
POD1000000021_S0000378	did you or your supporters do anything to help duke get into the run off with you
POD1000000021_S0000384	the edwards campaign it turns out had a totally different secret alliance
POD1000000021_S0000391	diamond mccord says the 2 of them hatched a plan
POD1000000021_S0000404	did governor edwards know about this strategy
POD1000000021_S0000407	when i asked edwards about the alliance he told me he did not know anything about it
POD1000000021_S0000408	in john mcginnis is book about the 1991 campaign clyde holloway is campaign advisor brian wagner also denied making any such deal
POD1000000021_S0000421	he also thinks edwards is totally corrupt
POD1000000021_S0000423	i am not saying it is immoral it is just amoral completely without regard to the morality of trying to help david duke get into the runoff and whether or not that would be good or bad for the state of louisiana
POD1000000021_S0000430	but what if they were wrong what if david duke one
POD1000000021_S0000446	on october 19th 1991 duke is fans gathered at the pantheon train center in his home territory of jefferson parish
POD1000000021_S0000467	david duke was in the run off with 32% of the vote
POD1000000021_S0000469	edwin edwards buddy romer is political consultant raymond strother knew his man was going to come in 3rd
POD1000000021_S0000475	buddy romer finished 5 points behind david duke
POD1000000021_S0000478	and tonight the people spoke and they said buddy thanks but you did not do enough and i think that is fair
POD1000000021_S0000479	when michelle schauer started working on the campaign she had been inspired by buddy roger is energy

POD1000000042_S0000611	how do you how do you pick how do you decide like what you know how do you decide like when donald trump does some i mean you know you got to forgive him for the shit
POD1000000042_S0000622	trump was the complete opposite of that and their response was to just lose their funny minds right now that is not always the case so let us say you are writing a train through the city
POD1000000042_S0000628	i get when you are saying but i get hard it is hard not to do that when aoc and her colleagues are talking about making lists of people who support trump i was not a trump supporter
POD1000000042_S0000648	no republicans are definitely going to flip the house in 2022 because let us just be real honest about what is going to happen even if anything biden was going to push would have made some positive dent
POD1000000042_S0000658	but what i hope is is i hope if anything if anything this next 4 years like obviously they probably will not pass much they probably will not change much we we i think we know that but man my hope for this country is is that if he does anything
POD1000000042_S0000665	yeah but he never would of he is download trump right so there is no he does not have that in his toolbox
POD1000000042_S0000683	which is what donald trump gave all the money to and says hey man we have it we have got the cure and it is and we are 90% right now we are going to have about 50 of these guys outs out into the world in january
POD1000000042_S0000688	let us be real about this the reason donald trump did not get reelected is not because people do not like the way he talks right because
POD1000000042_S0000727	you guys have been killing it man and it is a it is a fun show we enjoy it for danny danthy holloway to code a mire i am ross patterson we are the drinking bros good night everyone
POD1000000043_S0000009	welcome to podcast america i am john fevero
POD1000000043_S0000080	and there were a bunch of ephemiologists scientists and others saying that fouchi is timeline was way too optimistic for 12 to 18 months 11 months that is what this vaccination happened 11 months
POD1000000043_S0000084	this section is john basically being so mad at like a series of of articles in the athletic that were so annoying over the course of many it was like the doom gloom publication of choice for several months
POD1000000043_S0000100	failing to make any headway failing to actually stand up to trump you know doing the morally reprehensible and easy thing but like here is this guy fauci who i think like we will look back and say like did not extraordinary thing of serving his country
POD1000000043_S0000118	and so that is why you know that it is just it is horrible that we have to read these stories over and over again of of trump just politicizing the process when if he had just shut up and stepped back and let the process work things would be better
POD1000000043_S0000150	yeah to grandpa joe
POD1000000043_S0000169	on wonka is bullshit guest worker program
POD1000000043_S0000204	i am not saying that they should do what trump seems to be attempting to do with his executive order which is you know use the dpa or use the government to say hey fizer all your doses are for us they are not for other countries like like that is immoral
POD1000000043_S0000231	and i do not know hopefully we will figure out who did it i bet the email was like unopened in jared is inbox somewhere with one of his you know his college roommates you know told him not to do it or something
POD1000000043_S0000252	because he cares more about private equity backed insurance company profits than regular people maconnell is one of the worst people in political life in political history he is disgusting he is a corporate studdy he is cynical
POD1000000043_S0000257	but this is this this calls me nuts it is like and you know michelle mcconnell is going to get his way on this and this deal is probably going to pass with all of the shit that he wants in it or does not want in it is because he has got the fucking numbers and he has got donald trump in the white house like i saw you know
POD1000000043_S0000258	bernie sanders said we the deal is bad and we should not support the deal and like i agree with him in the sense that the deal is fucking bad the bipartisan compromise is bad
POD1000000043_S0000260	what is the what is the choice here like you are going you are not going to negotiate a better package with these republicans who you are going to get to vote for more money you are going to get susan collins and mit romney to vote for more run in leisa murkowski no they said this is as best that they would do
POD1000000043_S0000261	and if you do not take the deal and we do not win georgia we are not going to get a better deal when joe biden is president and joe biden is not going to have a mechanism to force a better deal because mitch mcconnell is going to sit there and say fuck you i have the numbers i do not have to pass a deal
POD1000000043_S0000264	to 20 to 15 now we are trying to get to one i what i do not know is what happens if they replace the state and local aid as it was drafted with direct payments does that become something that gets people like bernie back on board
POD1000000043_S0000265	i do not know maybe maybe you try that 0 i mean and burney is one thing but like like josh holly or some of these republicans want to direct payments yeah i would i would try to get as much in there as i could you know and i would try to push more direct payments for sure but like at the end of the day
POD1000000043_S0000301	i hate to say it guys like well one obvious thing that would be helpful is winning these georgia run offs but then you know i hate to say it but it would it would also help i think if brian kemp survived his primary challenge
POD1000000043_S0000305	because if like you know i have been saying that a lot of the concern over donald trump successfully overturning this election is a little over hyped
POD1000000043_S0000308	but then in the 2024 election if the if the republican candidate or if it is trump pulls what trump pulled again it goes to congress and now you have a republican house

YOU1000000021_S0000007	the game begins with zack fair soldier 2nd class of the group called soldier a private military army owned by the general electric power company in the city of midgar
YOU1000000021_S0000009	zack has tremendous skills and talent but is unfortunately a little overconfident and reckless at times as pointed out by his fellow soldier another 1st class name sephiroth
YOU1000000021_S0000011	and giel helps him out reminding him to temper his aspirations with passionate dreams and steadfast honor

YOU1000000021_S0000020	after the mission director lazard confirms angela really is gone for unknown reasons but assigns zack on a new mission
YOU1000000021_S0000027	finding angel is mother julian she notes zack is the restless puppy angela oster speak about and she tells him genesis came by a month ago with an army of minions and preceded to start killing toads

YOU1000000021_S0000077	the experiment was too foolish julian had jenova cells injected into her while she was pregnant with angela and genesis simply had jenova cells implanted directly into him as a test tube baby
YOU1000000021_S0000079	and gell can use the jenova cells as a 2 way conduit as intended and gell then explains his cells can absorb genetic traits and pass it to others beyond what genetics can manage which is only in print them onto others

YOU1000000129_S0000009	andrew story begins across the atlantic ocean in dunfermline scotland where he grew up in what could only be described as abject poverty
YOU1000000129_S0000022	carnegie would profit from it he was able to escape harms way after paying $850 for a substitute to take his place on the battlefield it was during this time that carnegie noticed that the wooden bridges were easily burned by the troops
YOU1000000129_S0000025	owning the iron sour meant that carnegie is bridge building company would not be dependent on mining or extracting companies for iron like their competitors this not only gave carnegie more control over the entire process it also improved their margins
YOU1000000129_S0000044	henry clay frick as a team carnegie and frick were a powerful force to be reckoned with and to show how ruthless the 2 could be look no further than the story about ducaine works
YOU1000000129_S0000059	in 18989% of all steel workers industry wide would die on the job when the workers refused frix aggressive demands for longer hours and less pay he decided to lock out all employees
YOU1000000129_S0000076	as the story goes j p morgan glanced at the offer and without hesitation accepted it morgan would buy carnegie steel for $480 making carnegie the single richest man in the world at the time
YOU1000000129_S0000077	carnegie would completely cut ties with his business life and dedicate 100% of himself to serving the world through philanthropy not a single dollar would be left to his family
YOU1000000129_S0000078	because andrew had only 5 years of schooling he had a soft spot for libraries which he credits for helping him achieve the financial success he acquired
YOU1000000129_S0000080	one example of his generosity is carnegie hall one of new york is most recognizable landmarks built in 1891 carnegie built and donated the building as the music hall
YOU1000000129_S0000085	perhaps he viewed donating his money as a way to atone for his business sins making money is a great feeling but an even better feeling is giving it away if you want to grow wealth and perhaps donate to noble causes like carnegie did
YOU1000000130_S0000011	by the time henry had become a teenager the steam engine was already making its way into the farming community cow powered threshing machines and sawmills were becoming common sight and henry was learning how they worked and how to fix them
YOU1000000130_S0000017	it is during this time that henry by chance learned about the gas engine from a british magazine it was being produced in small numbers by a german engineer nicholas
YOU1000000130_S0000018	and it was gaining some traction in europe but it was practically unheard of an america henry would get the chance to work on such an engine himself in 1889 and he instantly recognized the advantages it had
YOU1000000130_S0000020	this also allowed the gas engine to start quickly whereas steam engines of the time needed as much as 30 minutes to heat up the water and generate enough steam to start working the gas engine was an innovation henry fell in love with
YOU1000000130_S0000023	it was generating electricity for over a 1000 homes in detroit and it was doing so by using steam engines so henry was a natural hire for them whenever the engines broke henry had to fix them but whenever they were working
YOU1000000130_S0000029	he had driven a 1000 miles in henry built a 2nd quadricycle and then a 3rd one always improving the design before finally feeling confident enough in 1899 to start his own company
YOU1000000130_S0000032	and everyone was eager to see what henry could create with proper capital henry is plan was very clever since he personally knew many of the industrialists in detroit by that point he would try to build an automobile they could use in their businesses
YOU1000000130_S0000033	he leased a factory and planned to hire a 100 workers to make his new delivery wagon as he called it but it turned out that building such complex machines and high numbers was much more difficult than henry imagined
YOU1000000130_S0000041	henry labeled his 1st design as the model a and worked his way through the alphabet over the next 5 years sustained by capital from his friends and family
YOU1000000130_S0000044	the biggest game changer of all however was henry is chance visit to a slaughterhouse in chicago he saw there is something interesting a disassembly line so to speak where multiple workers would process carcasses moving down the line
YOU1000000130_S0000049	it is actually during the production of this model that henry would 1st use the assembly line process to at least partially assemble some of his cars
YOU1000000130_S0000060	they would help him transition his entire manufacturing process to use vanadium steel it was their chief engineer that built the heat treatment plant for henry in 19
YOU1000000130_S0000068	henry had begun a new age in american history the age of the automobile and it was his company that would totally dominate it in its 1st 2 decades
YOU1000000130_S0000069	it was not until the end of the 1920s that the rest of the auto industry caught up to henry but at that point he was already one of the richest men alive

YOU1000000131_S0000009	and john would live this nomadic lifestyle ever since he was 3 years old to help his mother john would earn any money he could by raising turkeys or doing work for neighbors his intelligence was put to good use
YOU1000000131_S0000012	thanks to his good reputation he got a loan of $4000 which at the time was a huge sum john started trading hay grain and various meats and in his 1st year he recorded sales of half a $10
YOU1000000131_S0000019	for the bi products of refining patrolum you see the early refineries in cleveland could only operate at about a 60% efficiency but john not only increased that percentage he also started selling all the bi products like paraphenalia
YOU1000000131_S0000025	of course not everyone would give up immediately and over time john eroded the price of oil and carbon sometimes by as much as 80% in order to strangle competitors unsurprisingly his strategy worked
YOU1000000131_S0000033	then to showcase his success john built an impressive headquarters for his company on broadway this moment was the high point of rockefeller standard oil
YOU1000000131_S0000040	and broke the company up into 34 separate entities of course john rockefeller kept his stake in those companies until his death and in fact it turns out that the breakup was the most profitable event in his life

YOU1000000139_S0000005	12 to 11 before the last game and as a world champion i had my last chance to retain the title by beating carp in this game 24 crucial game 24 i was not rushing from the beginning i tried to play a very quiet positional game
YOU1000000139_S0000011	next day when i showed up at the stage i was a couple of minutes earlier i have to say that with my coaches we have been analyzing this but we could not find any decisive ideas and then i saw carp of ending the stage
YOU1000000139_S0000030	i think that most likely anna will have resigned if i just take was a night on the 3 but suddenly i thought you know why i took with a night if i did not do the same by exchanging quinn
YOU1000000139_S0000036	and it is it cost me the victory in the final but also it is kind of a memory score so it is just it is something that is just it is it is sitting there so

YOU1000000139_S0000076	and the carp of made a quiet move king don one i put another rule here which is totally odd because both rules are just standing behind the point only 6 but i am just fighting against 5 and then carl duane i even play a 5

POD1000000004_S0000222	one thing salzberg mentioned in that clip was how his company was tackling a huge market now if you are defining the market as all the people who eat food in america then yeah that is a huge market
POD1000000004_S0000225	that is cara rasch she is a food and beverage analyst with package facts
POD1000000004_S0000227	it is hard to gauge but rash estimates that only about one of the us population uses home delivery meal kits and she says the market kind of peaked 2 or 3 years ago
POD1000000004_S0000229	remember when we said amazon trademarked its meal kit back in 2017 rash says the company never did much with it and that is a pretty good indicator that meal kit delivery is not a growing global concern
POD1000000004_S0000232	and there were more problems within a month of the ipo co founder matt wadiak stepped down as coo matt salzberg then the ceo resigned his post shortly thereafter
POD1000000004_S0000235	welcome to training nation i am eric chummy let us take a look at one of last year is high profile ipos that is getting absolutely smoked we are talking of course about blue apple the stock sinking as much as 4% on friday
POD1000000004_S0000239	the move raised the company is stock price but customers still were not flocking to blue apron is boxes now at this point i would have thrown in the towel but not ceo linda finley kozlowski
POD1000000004_S0000240	the company would not make kozlowski available for a chat but here she is last year on cnbc is squawk on the street talking about how jazz she is about blue apron is prospects
POD1000000004_S0000242	but also blue apple was thinking about getting down with some strategic alternatives says mark watches tonya garcia
POD1000000004_S0000246	in early 2020 blue apple put the word out that it was interested in possibly getting scooped up maybe by a big grocery chain or someone else with deep pockets who wanted to own a meal kit delivery business
POD1000000004_S0000247	at the same time garcia says the company acted like it was in turnaround mode it decided to streamline operations including shutting down its fulfillment center in texas
POD1000000004_S0000260	the pandemic seems like it is given blue april a decent little boost in the 2nd quarter of the company brought in 20000 more subscribers but that is still way below where they were in 2019

POD1000000010_S0000001	in this episode how to raise kind kids and to truly understand kindness anya and i visited a mother who is lived through every parent is worst nightmare
POD1000000010_S0000004	her name is scarlett luis and before we met her curry i have to confess that i was not necessarily all that impressed with kindness as an idea i mean
POD1000000010_S0000007	but that really really changed for me when we traveled to wireless connectivity to spend some time with scarlett
POD1000000010_S0000010	scarlett named this place wild rose farm there are a few chickens clucking in a wire cup behind a muddy pasture where there is also a horse
POD1000000010_S0000014	we get there in time to watch her feed the animals including her constant companions 3 dogs remington rocky and olive
POD1000000010_S0000017	so scarlett leads us inside the house and i remember we took our jackets off in the mud room and hanging there was a 1st graders black and blue ski jacket
POD1000000010_S0000018	and scarlett stopped and she pulled out a pair of these funny looking teeth out of the pocket joke teeth
POD1000000010_S0000023	scarlet is son jesse had these teeth in this coat at sandy hook elementary school the day he died
POD1000000010_S0000024	my name is scarlett lewis and i am the founder of the jesse lewis choose love movement
POD1000000010_S0000026	here in sandy hook connecticut in 2012 scarlet lived through every parent is nightmare
POD1000000010_S0000030	every surface is covered with painting scarlet is done and photos of jessie and his brother jt
POD1000000010_S0000031	and one of the cabinets has chocolate paint on it and on it is a message from jesse
POD1000000010_S0000033	scarlett did not notice this message until she returned to the house several days after the shooting to find clues for jesse to wear in his casket
POD1000000010_S0000040	sarah says she has no idea how or where her little boy came up with those 3 words
POD1000000010_S0000047	i am anya kamenets an education reporter and the mother of 2 girls
POD1000000010_S0000048	and i am cory turner an education reporter and the father of 2 boys
POD1000000010_S0000059	so cory yes kindness is important but i guess i always just assume that my kids would learn it naturally through osmosis
POD1000000010_S0000061	well you know on anya you are not alone in that assumption
POD1000000010_S0000064	that is jennifer kotler she is one of our expert guides today through what turns out to be a pretty complicated subject
POD1000000010_S0000069	exhibit a is this study jen points to out of harvard a few years back
POD1000000010_S0000074	yeah and this kind of like self delusion this is just one of many reasons scarlet worries that this culture is creating huge problems
POD1000000010_S0000077	and of course her life is a really stark reminder cory of just how high the stakes can be when we talk about things like mental health and kids who are troubled
POD1000000010_S0000080	after she read that message from jesse scarlett reached out to a team of researchers and educators and she created a plan to essentially teach children kindness step by step value by value
POD1000000010_S0000081	yeah the jesse lewis chooses love enrichment program they estimate it is now reached over a 10 students
POD1000000010_S0000085	so let us follow scarlet is lead and semester streets and talk about how the science of kindness can translate into action
POD1000000010_S0000095	thomas lickona says we see signs of what is called empathic distress even in tiny babies
POD1000000010_S0000098	and tom told us that baby is moral sense seems to go even deeper
POD1000000010_S0000100	so this is like i was saying cory i always thought kids are just born to be kind
POD1000000010_S0000103	only about a 3rd of the kids actually responded in that moment with altruism with kindness by say going over to the child offering a hug calling for an adult
POD1000000010_S0000104	thank you very much
POD1000000010_S0000106	let us bring in bella he is trying to track you
POD1000000010_S0000109	i do not know but
POD1000000010_S0000112	yeah yeah
POD1000000010_S0000138	and that is why scarlett says
POD1000000010_S0000144	the jesse lewis choose love program for kids from pk through high school actually begins with courage
POD1000000010_S0000145	and i want to mention that reports of the shooting said that jesse himself showed incredible courage
POD1000000010_S0000147	yeah and scarlet is definition of courage is even bigger than that sort of
POD1000000010_S0000154	it is also scarlett says the courage to stand up to someone who is bullying you or someone you know by taking their perspective and seeing the world through their eyes
POD1000000010_S0000160	you know hearing about courage in that way in that moment really spoke to me cory because i have to admit this
POD1000000010_S0000161	i was a little afraid to sit down with scarlett
POD1000000010_S0000165	one really practical way scarlet is chew love plan builds character is by teaching kids to stay calm
POD1000000010_S0000170	jen kotler at sessame says if you are more aware of your emotions you will also be more aware of everyone else is
POD1000000010_S0000186	yeah before jen started at sesame workshop she spent her days in a classroom
POD1000000010_S0000190	the problem jen found out with forced apologies is that they are usually pretty worthless
POD1000000010_S0000193	yeah so tom lickona and jen kotler both told us instead of focusing on kids parrining the words sorry
POD1000000010_S0000196	jen says you can actually take a moment like this
POD1000000010_S0000200	jen says sesame street has improved over time in how it depicts apologies on the show
POD1000000010_S0000202	so elmo might say i was really wanting to play with my scooter and i did not want to share it
POD1000000010_S0000206	we have got it sorry
POD1000000010_S0000207	but but way what about your turn
POD1000000010_S0000208	we can be patient and wait for his turn
POD1000000010_S0000209	so what do you say 0 we
POD1000000010_S0000214	nice job sharing 0 well
POD1000000010_S0000228	you hurt amy
POD1000000010_S0000231	tom also says the children should learn to make an apology of action
POD1000000010_S0000236	and scarlett louis says that means when parents grew up we need to apologize too
POD1000000010_S0000240	if anything scarlett talks even more about the other side of an apology forgiveness
POD1000000010_S0000250	i love this too because scarlett is really focusing on the benefit of letting go of anger
POD1000000010_S0000252	and it was at this point we are sitting with scarlett in her kitchen her back is to a refrigerator which is covered with photos of jesse and her other son jt and we just had to ask
POD1000000010_S0000268	aija simmons helps run the social and emotional programs for schools in oakland california
POD1000000010_S0000277	tom lickona says it is not just about celebrating kind actions
POD1000000010_S0000281	yeah part of how scarlett keeps going she told us is by constantly reminding herself even out loud what she is grateful for
POD1000000010_S0000285	and tom agrees
POD1000000010_S0000302	that is a great point cory i have got to try that
POD1000000010_S0000306	yeah in fact scarlett louis says
POD1000000010_S0000308	and similarly tom says kindness as a virtue is not random it is a habit
POD1000000010_S0000313	so tom says you know not for an allowance but just to give the message that this is what we do to help out because we are part of something bigger
POD1000000010_S0000314	and for my daughter lulu who is 7 that chore really is taking care of the cat
POD1000000010_S0000322	and here is a really good news tom told us
POD1000000010_S0000327	and that is why he says we are happier when we are helping and jenet sesame agrees
POD1000000010_S0000329	and that is why scarlett says we should talk to kids directly about this helper is high
POD1000000010_S0000346	time for a recap on you
POD1000000010_S0000360	the kind of courage to see the world the way scarlett lewis does

POD1000000017_S0000003	this week wesley morris on the birth of american music
POD1000000017_S0000005	so last fall i am at my friend is house we are making dinner i am chopping vegetables and i asked my friend brett who was cooking with me can you put on some music
POD1000000017_S0000009	at some point brett has to go run an errand and i think i might have sent him on one i do not remember but he has gone so i am alone just me with the vegetables and the yard work
POD1000000017_S0000019	deal away by robby dupree
POD1000000017_S0000031	i am hearing things like rosanna by toto
POD1000000017_S0000041	there is something jazz like in the syncopated music of something like stealy dan
POD1000000017_S0000043	you can hear in somebody like michael mcdonald
POD1000000017_S0000049	and the song in which i am hearing it the deepest and strongest and most powerfully at least to me standing in that kitchen shopping those vegetables was when kenny loggins this is it
POD1000000017_S0000053	yeah kenny loggins is basically singing the verses on the song
POD1000000017_S0000058	and then on the pre chorus kenny loggins disappears and who shows up michael mcgonald
POD1000000017_S0000060	giving kenny loggins plenty of time to gather himself
POD1000000017_S0000066	scrapping the pan is the blackest thing you can do as a singer and here is kenny loggins as this white artist doing it
POD1000000017_S0000078	i am thinking about amy whitehouse
POD1000000017_S0000080	i am thinking about anne lennox
POD1000000017_S0000082	do you know about george michael
POD1000000017_S0000084	i think about chris stapleton just vote no
POD1000000017_S0000087	and one of the many phases in which david bowie really wanted to make r and b and soul music
POD1000000017_S0000089	this is the sound not just of black america but the sound of america it is deeply american almost especially when it is sung by british people like david bowie and anne lennex and amy winehouse
POD1000000017_S0000103	and then the who will be to the landing corner you have someone like billy mccrea
POD1000000017_S0000114	it is what you would have heard passing a black person doing his job entertaining himself doing the drama of work the way a guy named thomas dartmouth rice did sometimes around the 1830s
POD1000000017_S0000116	one day he is touring with a troop in sinsinety or maybe it was pittsburgh we do not really know but the myth basically goes t d race happened upon an old black man cleaning a horse in a stable
POD1000000017_S0000117	the man was doing his job on property owned by a white man named crow roger
POD1000000017_S0000122	whatever race here is coming out of this man is mouth is captivating to him and what he sees is an opportunity
POD1000000017_S0000133	and so when t d rice hears this black man singing this song moving his body in this particular way ding a light bulb goes off
POD1000000017_S0000140	come listen all you guys and boys i am just from texas home i am going to sing a little song my name is jim crome
POD1000000017_S0000142	and the lyrics give the horse drummer a name and the name is jim crow
POD1000000017_S0000146	this is the 1st time a paying audience is basically electrified by a white man with a black face this is the night that jim crow was electedly introduced to america this mascot of american racism
POD1000000017_S0000148	and here is thomas dartmouth rice giving it to them this is the night that american popular culture was born
POD1000000017_S0000151	so you have other ministerial acts who come along and try to do what thomas dartmouth rice is doing a song and a dance
POD1000000017_S0000175	some of those people having these dreams go on to become people like steven foster
POD1000000017_S0000177	the man wildly credited as being the father of american music
POD1000000017_S0000197	e miller and scat man crothers
POD1000000017_S0000210	did you griffiths the birth of a nation full of white men violently in black face
POD1000000017_S0000220	judy garland performed in black face
POD1000000017_S0000222	bing crosby and fred astaire both performed in black face
POD1000000017_S0000227	out of these recordings you have people like muddy waters
POD1000000017_S0000237	you have the advent of a place like blue no records where lots of amazing jazz was created and then released into the world
POD1000000017_S0000239	double arm strong
POD1000000017_S0000241	in duke ellington
POD1000000018_S0000000	when andy griffith passed away in 2012 c and n covered his death often on the entire day
POD1000000018_S0000003	larry king is one of the people who called him to talk that day he would had andy on his various shows numerous times and he mentioned something in passing that is really interesting
POD1000000018_S0000005	what larry said is that a lawyer named percy foreman was the man who inspired the character matlock
POD1000000018_S0000007	this was a weird thing for anyone to say because most people even today believe that character to be based on a different lawyer named bobby lee cook
POD1000000018_S0000009	however in 20153 years after larry king said something that most people would assume was incorrect the creator of matlock did confirm that the character was based on percy forman
POD1000000018_S0000012	percy was able to achieve this record by being an incredible lawyer no denying it but also due to the texas court system is practice of using jury trials to determine guilt as well as sentencing in the case of a guilty verdict
POD1000000018_S0000016	percy had 12 average citizens from the local community sitting right there waiting to be convinced that the victim in this situation was not a victim at all
POD1000000018_S0000019	foreman called it misdemeanor murder that is where a jury might convict you of ending another person is life and send you on your way with the type of punishment you would receive for a misdemeanor crime
POD1000000018_S0000021	percy forman had such a long run of wins with this strategy that it is still being used in texas today people who have conversations about this sort of thing will sometimes refer to it as the texas defense
POD1000000018_S0000023	now jim denny was not from texas he was from tennessee
POD1000000018_S0000025	when a 16 year old jim denny got hired to work the mail room of duke s m radios parent company he must have seen it as an opportunity to make something out of himself
POD1000000018_S0000027	denny got this job in 1927 that year the young radio program danny smith barn dans was referred to as the grand ole opry for the 1st time on air
POD1000000018_S0000029	every time an audio job came up at the opry ally jim would take it so he could hang out back stage see the artists and see how the show was made
POD1000000018_S0000030	within 20 years denny had worked his way up to director of the artist service bureau at dubai s m which meant he was in charge of booking the ax on the opry
POD1000000018_S0000032	there is a few funny things from jim denny is time at the grand ole opry like the one about elvis presley is big day
POD1000000018_S0000033	elvis was still a teenager when denny did sam phillips the favor of letting elvis come on the show to play his not country arrangement of blue moon of kentucky
POD1000000018_S0000035	it did not go well denny is rumored to have told elvis back stage you do not going nowhere son you ought to go back to drive and a truck
POD1000000018_S0000037	denny is also the guy who fired hank williams over the telephone and there is the time when jim made johnny cash wait outside his office for 2 hours before letting him in to ask why cash should be allowed to play on the opry
POD1000000018_S0000039	cash mentioned that he presently had a song called i walk behind in the top 10
POD1000000018_S0000041	jim denny was what many people referred to in those times as a hard man today i think they would have some different words for him and that is why ernest tubb tried to shoot him in
POD1000000018_S0000044	my name is tyler mahan coe i have heard these stories my whole life
POD1000000018_S0000047	it is shocking to hear ernest tubbs name associated with any kind of violence whatsoever
POD1000000018_S0000051	crisp texas is a ghost town now ernest tubb was born there in 1914 into a family of sharecroppers like most sharecroppers children ernest grew up working on farms all over the area
POD1000000018_S0000054	like a great number of artists will learn about in future episodes it was all over for a 14 year old ernest tubb the 1st time he heard jimmy rodgers sing
POD1000000018_S0000058	hearing jimmy rodgers is what led earnest tubb to decide he simply had to become a country singer
POD1000000018_S0000059	it is also very specifically what caused him 3 decades later to want to shoot a 357 magnum at jim denny
POD1000000018_S0000062	the death of his idol was extremely upsetting for earnest however it also made him realize that he was going to have to get serious about chasing his dreams
POD1000000018_S0000067	holding down 3 jobs at once was necessary to support himself and his young wife elaine they did not waste any time before starting to have kids either
POD1000000018_S0000069	ernest was more than happy to work hard if it kept him moving towards the life of his hero jimmy rodgers
POD1000000018_S0000070	he would had this small picture of jimmy for years now and it was in pretty bad shape so he got a phone book and looked up the number for jimmy rodgers
POD1000000018_S0000071	he called her on the phone to explain that he was such a big fan and to see if she happened to have a bigger better photo of jimmy that ernest could have maybe even one that was autographed
POD1000000018_S0000072	kerry was super nice and she did have such a photo that ernest could have and went so far as to invite him out to her house in carverville texas to get the picture
POD1000000018_S0000073	ernest drove out there the next sunday he was not working taking elaine and their baby justin on the trip
POD1000000018_S0000075	they would planned to stay for maybe 10 minutes and ended up hanging out for over 2 hours looking at costumes guitars and pictures brought out by miss roger roger hearing her stories about how high on the hog they would lived merely a few years earlier
POD1000000018_S0000076	et could never have guessed when he woke up that morning that he would be laying down to sleep that night having held jimmy rodger is signature martin acoustic guitar with jimmy is name inlayed in purle across the fretboard and the word thanks written on the back upside down
POD1000000018_S0000080	okay now add this on top of that a few months later carrie rodgers called ernest to say she would listened for his radio show as he would asked for her to do
POD1000000018_S0000082	on the other hand she did not think he sounded like jimmy rodgers when he sang which is basically the only thing in the world earnest tubb wanted to do in this phase of his life
POD1000000018_S0000085	anyway she still hooked dt up with elsie mcwilliams the writer of a few great jimmy rodgers songs
POD1000000018_S0000086	earnest tubb made a couple of records that did not sell very well did some touring and ended up back home doing low paying radio again and working 2 or 3 side jobs like before driving around a beer truck was one of them
POD1000000018_S0000088	after a while back at home ernest had to have his tonsils taken out he would later say the doctors told him not to sing or yoda for a while after the surgery but he did not listen
POD1000000018_S0000093	earnest held a self deprecating sense of humor about his own voice for the rest of his life he loved to say that 9 out of 10 guys sitting in bars around the country could sing much better than he could
POD1000000018_S0000094	i do not know if he really believe that it is always been strange to me i think george jones indisputably the greatest country singer in history is exactly what happens when you add ernest tubbs new singing style and ray acuff is voice together
POD1000000018_S0000096	you just heard some earnest here is a little roy acuff from 1942
POD1000000018_S0000098	now george jones would have told you hank williams was his favorite singer you do not get hank without earnest and roy i have seen lefty frizell named as an influence on george
POD1000000018_S0000099	lefty borrowed from ernest as well however you want to say we got to george jones it always comes back to roy acuff and ernest tubb
POD1000000018_S0000100	now the part of earnest you can hear in george is the tendency to hold on to a note for longer than you would expect picking the melody up and putting it back down in ways that are impossible to predict when hearing them sing a song for the 1st time
POD1000000018_S0000106	it is possible earnest really did not like his new voice about a 10 people disagree with his opinion he had that tonsilectomy in 1939
POD1000000018_S0000107	in 1940 he had his biggest hit walking in the floor over you this song is still canonical with the name ernest tubb
POD1000000018_S0000108	if someone only knows one earnest tubb song it is usually this song
POD1000000018_S0000111	the texas troubador earnest tubb
POD1000000018_S0000115	tub would stay working for the rest of his life so members of the texas troubadors would be replaced every now and then
POD1000000018_S0000116	buddy emmons jack green billy burd lion roads and cal smith are only some of the notable players who joined the band on their way up the ladder
POD1000000018_S0000118	this was the 1st way earnest found to extend a helping hand to younger musicians like the hand carry roger rodgers had held out to him
POD1000000018_S0000123	and so he started calling their names out when they took took a course but he was never jellous of anybody in his band outshining him he did not you know he did not mind that at all as he freed with jack green and cal smith
POD1000000018_S0000124	and of course he had the wilburds with him for a while and skeeter worked some days with him george jones stonewall jackson and he was always pushing them and he like roy i think understood that the bigger they became the bigger he became
POD1000000018_S0000125	george jones and stonewall jackson were never texas troubadors justin meant et took those guys out on tour with him as opening axes to help them build their own following and often he did a lot more than that
POD1000000018_S0000127	johnny paycheck
POD1000000018_S0000129	ernest one time i was hanging around the streets and it was snowing and buddy emmons took me on the meeting i always won the meeting
POD1000000018_S0000131	and evidently buddy had told him that
POD1000000018_S0000138	you can not tell the hank snow story without talking about earnest tubb et told johnny cash not to smile when he performed full some prison blues so people in the audience could really feel the song
POD1000000018_S0000139	cash never forgot the advice hank williams senior was heavily influenced by earnest music and earnest is the one who convinced the grand ole opry to bring hank back after his 1st failed audition
POD1000000018_S0000140	et got hank to promise he would not touch any booze for 3 months to swing that one
POD1000000018_S0000141	in 1947 enough radio listeners wrote letters complaining of not being able to find his music that he launched the earnest tubb record shop in nashville if you could not make it there in person they would ship records directly to you
POD1000000018_S0000144	the record shop operated at a loss of $10000 a year for the 1st 2 years it was open but earnest knew how important it was and he kept it alive
POD1000000018_S0000147	earnest played host to opry stars and newcomers like making sure to remind you this music was available for mail order from earnest tubbs record shop he took the chance to keep jimmy roger is memory alive pitching his records as well
POD1000000018_S0000149	earnest never grew out of his fascination with jimmy rodgers and never stopped repaying his debt to jimmy is widdow carry jimmy is death had left carry in a pretty bad financial situation but she still got money from the sales of his records which were declining
POD1000000018_S0000150	he realized the more jimmy rodgers records sold the better off carrie would be so et pushed those records as hard as he could
POD1000000018_S0000151	kerry loaned and eventually flat out gave him that guitar of jimmy is which is why you will frequently see pictures of videos of ernest tubb playing a guitar that says jimmy rodgers on it
POD1000000018_S0000152	in 1953 earnest helped found the jimmy roger is memorial festival in roger is hometown of meridian mississippi that is a stand up guy
POD1000000018_S0000154	you can find plenty of people who will say the same thing about jim denny
POD1000000018_S0000155	remember jim poor kid from tennessee worked his way up from the mail room to become director of art services at duke university and manager of the grand ole opry
POD1000000018_S0000157	denny was a powerful man in nashville and he acted like he knew it
POD1000000018_S0000158	where ernest tubb built a reputation for helping young musicians jim denny had a reputation for acting like a dick
POD1000000018_S0000160	the johnny cash et gave advice to is the same johnny cash who had to wait 2 hours outside denny is office
POD1000000018_S0000162	jim denny might not have been a dick he could have simply been a businessman who paid more attention to the bottom line than how many friends he had
POD1000000018_S0000163	denny is the guy who had to be convinced to let hank senior onto the opry and he is the guy who called hank to fire him over the telephone but ernest tubb was standing in denny is office when that phone call was made
POD1000000018_S0000164	he said he saw tears in jim is eyes
POD1000000018_S0000165	hank had missed a scheduled opera appearance most likely for no good reason other than that he was drunk denny said he thought firing hank would make him realize he needed to get his act together
POD1000000018_S0000166	that is not what happened hank williams died 4 months after being dismissed from the opry it is tragic but you can see how jim denny thought he was doing the right thing in that situation
POD1000000018_S0000167	this is important to recognize because the year hank williams died is the same year that jim denny formed cedar wood publishing with web pierce
POD1000000018_S0000172	roy acuff and fred rose had started acuff rose music back in 1942
POD1000000018_S0000174	they were the best game in town until jim denny formed seder wood in 53
POD1000000018_S0000175	as head of artist services at duke university and manager of the grand ole opry jim denny controlled who got to play in the opry their place in the lineup and how long they got to play
POD1000000018_S0000178	if jim denny owns a country music publishing firm while retaining singular control of the most popular country music radio program in america then he is essentially printing his own money
POD1000000018_S0000181	if the writer does not want to be a performer congratulations web pierce is the biggest star on the opry and he is playing your song on the grand ole opry tonight
POD1000000018_S0000182	roy acuff was pist off and he did not stay quiet about it he said denny was giving the best bots to his own artists artists signed to acuff rows had a tenacity to see roy is point
POD1000000018_S0000183	artist signed to cedar wood had a tendency to think jim denny was not doing anything wrong weird
POD1000000018_S0000184	long story short in 1956 debbie smith fired jim denny over his conflicts of interest
POD1000000018_S0000186	he started a booking agency and signed most of the opry artists some of whom had resigned when denny was fired then denny contacted the philip morris tabacco company
POD1000000018_S0000188	so when jim denny called with a chance for them to get their product associated with all those acts philip morris wrote a check big enough to fund the biggest country music package tour anyone had ever seen
POD1000000018_S0000191	it looked as though everyone was getting what they wanted until the philip moors country music show booked a stop in meridian mississippi on the same week as the 5th annual jimmie rodgers memorial festival
POD1000000018_S0000194	for 5 years ernest tubb had worked to grow the jimmie rodgers festival from scratch this is a tremendously difficult thing to do et put in the effort to honor his idol
POD1000000018_S0000196	jim denny was not simply setting up shop across the street with some healthy competition
POD1000000018_S0000197	he brought a free show to town on the same night with half the grand old opry lineup and several big names you would have had to buy a ticket to see on the jimmy rodgers event the previous night
POD1000000018_S0000199	it would crush bonaroo this was such a big deal that they did not even have the jimmy rodgers memorial festival the following year
POD1000000018_S0000200	they regrouped to put one on again in 1959 but kerry rodgers health had already taken a turn for the worse and ernest tubb was never involved with the festival again
POD1000000018_S0000205	according to billy burd ernest tubb is reaction to the philip morris country music show undercutting the jimmy roger is memorial festival was to get drunk and stay drunk for the better part of a week
POD1000000018_S0000206	they carted him back to nashville but he was still drinking and he was still mad as hell at jim denny
POD1000000018_S0000207	finally he called denny at home in the middle of the night to cuss him out denny said something like well if you are so mad about it then how about you just meet me down at duke university right now and we will settle things for good
POD1000000018_S0000209	that sounded like a great plan to earnest tubb he strapped on a gun belt with bullets and a 357 magnum in the holster and drove down town in his catalac wearing house slippers
POD1000000018_S0000210	meanwhile when jim danny had hung up the phone he simply took it back off the hook again so ernest could not call him anymore and then went back to sleep
POD1000000018_S0000212	so ernest tubb is drunk off his asswith a loaded gun when he stumbles into the lobby of the national life building where dubs was located
POD1000000018_S0000217	bill williams the news director at abc says he was walking into work when a gun shot rang out in the lobby and a bullet went over his head into the wall
POD1000000018_S0000218	he turned around you know pretty scared and saw earnest tubb standing there in his house slippers with a revolver
POD1000000018_S0000220	when he asked ernest what the hell he was doing ernest said my god i have shot the wrong man
POD1000000018_S0000221	whether or not he had been actively trying to kill anyone we will never know for certain it seems to me like he thought he had successfully shot someone and was only upset that someone was not jim denny
POD1000000018_S0000222	either way ernest set down after thinking he would shot an innocent person bill williams called his boss jack the wit to tell him what happened jack told bill to take ernest home
POD1000000018_S0000225	earnest tubb went to jail for drunken disorderly plus carrying the weapon
POD1000000018_S0000227	so earnest bought cigarettes for all the other inmates and sang songs with him while bill williams waited to take him home
POD1000000018_S0000231	jim denny is name was kept out of the papers though everyone in the business could read between the lines and see who earnest had wanted to shoot
POD1000000018_S0000233	the incident seems to have had no effect on earnest tubbs career whatsoever apparently if all e t was trying to do was put a bullet in jim denny then that was fine
POD1000000018_S0000236	in 1984 his lungs killed him just like his hero jimmy rodgers
POD1000000018_S0000238	the midnight jamboree still airs every saturday night and you can still buy music from ernest tubbs record shop or online at et record shop dot com
POD1000000018_S0000240	we are told that in 1963 ernest tubb made up with jim denny before jim passed away from cancer the jim denny artist burrow stayed in business for only a few more years
POD1000000018_S0000242	jim denny was inducted to the country music hall of fame in 1966 cedar wood jim denny is publishing company was sold to mel tillis in 1983
POD1000000018_S0000243	ernest tubb had been inducted to the country music hall of fame in 1965 while he was still alive
POD1000000018_S0000247	be nice every episode of cain and rine stones is written and produced by me tyler mahan coe
POD1000000018_S0000252	okay 1st of all if i did not make it clear it is impossible to overstate ernest tubbs importance to country music
POD1000000018_S0000254	if you want to call it hanky panky and it happened after earnest tubb it was influenced by earnest tubb before i get to the story in the episode i would like to address one other thing
POD1000000018_S0000255	in the 1980s clyde moody tried to start an alternative association to the country music health of fame called the country music pioneer association
POD1000000018_S0000256	the c m p a had a trachy newspaper that clyde essentially used to rant against the industry and print whatever shitty rumors people sent in
POD1000000018_S0000257	among these rumors was one that ernest tubb died broke and alone in a cheap downtown motel shunned by the country music world he had done so much to help
POD1000000018_S0000259	charlie louvin even has it in his autobiography which is not the only thing charlie got wrong on that book but i will talk about that another time
POD1000000018_S0000260	1st of all the source was ernest tubbs astranged wife next ernest died owning 70% of the ernest tubb record shop which had multiple locations running and was very profitable at that time he was not a broke man
POD1000000018_S0000262	i believe ernest chose to turn visitors away because he was wasting away of ephesian and did not want anyone who loved him to have that as their last memory of him
POD1000000018_S0000265	and i think justin said that people would go would try to see earnest and he would tell justin to tell them thank you but he would rather not have the company
POD1000000018_S0000266	so you know i mean the end i do not think that ernest tubb died you know in a sad state of affairs i think that he did
POD1000000018_S0000268	i think he did a lot for country music and i think he went out the way that he wanted to go it seems like to me okay back to ernest tubb and jim denny
POD1000000018_S0000269	what about this story right is was that crazy it it is just so many things like the the routes of country music are just growing all over this story you know you have got jim denny showing up right as the grand ole opry is becoming a thing
POD1000000018_S0000270	ernest tubb gets in there and his track is broken so he can not do what he wanted to do his whole life which is imitate his hero
POD1000000018_S0000271	and then his story gets broken and so now he has got to create this new thing and he ends up influencing hank williams season and like everyone that is that is crazy it is amazing i love this story
POD1000000018_S0000273	at least the part about ernest tubb getting drunk and going down to the radio station with a gun and shooting and firing off around into the wall you know
POD1000000018_S0000274	people always bring that up as an example of how wild and crazy these old guys were everybody laughs about ernest getting held off to jail and ultimately getting away with causing a little bit of trouble you know up boys will be boys
POD1000000018_S0000276	thanks to ronnie pues very well done biography on ernest tubb that finally had the story for me and the big jimmy rodgers festival thing while that affected ernest so deeply that was in there
POD1000000018_S0000277	the most detailed account of bill williams version of the lobby shooting was in there
POD1000000018_S0000278	i went with bills version because a he was the news director of cnn with a reputation for being able to throw away that day is news script and add lib the news without making a mistake
POD1000000018_S0000279	and b he was the one right in the middle of it you know he called his boss at home he went with earnest to the jail shot out jim farney everyone else just seemed like a bike stander trying to get their name involved you know
POD1000000018_S0000280	like a security guard saying that he told ernest to put the gun away and ernest fired it off to dare the security guard or whatever you know i mean
POD1000000018_S0000282	also i am aware there are you know different revisionist history type opinions about how well elvis presley is debut on the grand ole opry did or did not go
POD1000000018_S0000285	i have seen every year from 1924 to 1929 cited as the year of danny being hired at the parent company of abc that insurance company the life insurance company i do not really care what year he you know exactly was let us
POD1000000018_S0000286	there was a biography of johnny cash that quoted a rolling stone interview with johnny talking about jim denny making him wait outside his office for 2 hours
POD1000000018_S0000287	larry jordan is biography on jim reeves had a bunch of great information on the jim dandy opry scandal i found a billboard magazine from 1956 reporting that philip morris paid over $40 for the talent on that 1st package tour
POD1000000018_S0000291	i am going to say this guy is last name wrong craig have a herse havig herse i do not know he wrote a book on the history of
POD1000000018_S0000294	i know i am going to keep coming back to this book for future episodes a lot of what i got out of that for this was about denny is firing because pretty much everywhere else you hear people talk about denny getting fired
POD1000000018_S0000295	they are all like yeah i do not know it was just like weird no one really knows why he got fired or you have got artists who were with caesar wood saying jim danny got rail roded
POD1000000018_S0000296	you have got artists who were with ac dc rows saying denny was corrupt and he had to get out of there you know so this dvd book was really good just to find out straight up what happened
POD1000000018_S0000298	i mentioned that hank senior was heavily influenced by earnest tubb but also some of the most charming stuff i have ever read about hank is the way he acted around earnest
POD1000000018_S0000299	you know they were peers they were contemporaries eh hank was influenced by him but then he you know got to come to the show
POD1000000018_S0000300	and be a part of the big time and you just get the idea that he was just like a kid in a candy store around honest tubb you get the the idea that he just really loved being around this guy and he could not help messing with him he was always screwing with earnest
POD1000000018_S0000301	ernest tubb song walking the floor over you hank williams took that image of walking the floor and put it in your cheating heart you know you will walk the floor like i do
POD1000000018_S0000302	and he and he had a monster hit with it and he just could not he could not leave earnest alone about it you know just like hey earnest where you think about that i stood that stood that image from you i got your image boy like just that kind of shit
POD1000000018_S0000303	that clip of justin tubb talking and the clip of johnny paycheck talking are both from the country family reunion dvds which are pretty much all amazing if you have never seen those
POD1000000018_S0000304	i think it is bill anderson that host them there has got to be 20 of them in a series they have always got different old school people on there sitting around talking telling stories
POD1000000018_S0000305	just i mean if you see one any of the ones with grandpa jones any of the ones with grandpa jones or little jimmy dickens on them are fucking hilarious you have got to see them just
POD1000000018_S0000309	there is a book called andy and don with the confirmation of percy fourman inspiring matt lock
POD1000000018_S0000310	percy is no longer alive and his new york times obituary had some other interesting information that i did not know
POD1000000018_S0000311	like jack ruby asked percy foreman to defend him after shooting lee harvey oswald but then there was this communication error like
POD1000000018_S0000312	jack ruby is people told jack that forman wanted like 5 times as much money as he had ever asked from anyone or something so he was like well scrue that i got someone else
POD1000000018_S0000313	and and forman like seemed disappointed that he did not get that case so i guess he wanted that but forman did represent martin luther king juniors assassin james earl ray
POD1000000018_S0000314	but only long enough to convince him to play guilty so yeah james did not get away with that
POD1000000018_S0000321	it was only after uncovering the percy foreman matt lock connection that i learned that it was really just a legal defense strategy that works so incredibly well there it may as well be a law
POD1000000018_S0000326	then next week i am going to be talking about loretta lynn song the pill it is about the birth control pill and it was banned from radio and i was looking into why and i found out a lot of really really interesting stuff you know and things
POD1000000018_S0000328	it is it is crazy it is really crazy definitely come back next week laura lynn the pill
POD1000000022_S0000000	hello everyone i am stephen west this is philosophize this thank you to everyone that supports the show on patreon and thank you to the people that do not support the show by going through the amazon bar
POD1000000022_S0000001	apologies for the voice and my lack of execution today i am just getting over a cold but it had been too long since i would grazed you with my voice and i want to give you guys this today is episode is part 6 in a series on sartre camus i hope you love the show today
POD1000000022_S0000004	maybe you do not sit around poised waiting to make other people aware of some bad thing that happened to you in the past well enough of that crazy talk get off the bench because your uncle steve is putting you in the game i am here to tell you do not worry my friend you are a victim you really are
POD1000000022_S0000012	and at the time of sartre for over 300 years people had been pointing out how many of the ways we look at things in the western world are largely derivative from the way christianity describes being a human being
POD1000000022_S0000023	that a reasonable expectation to have when navigating your life is that one day you are going to wake up and there is going to be some event some mythical that you witness some transcendent moment where you realize the divinity of jesus
POD1000000022_S0000030	maybe for some of you out there there is only one other person in this entire world that has full access to your true self hidden deep within you but sarah would say is this really how the self works
POD1000000022_S0000031	is the self really like the christian soul hidden somewhere deep within you that only you have access to sarah would say it very well may be that you put on a mask when you go out in public for the sake of pragmatism and it very well may be that you have reflected on yourself
POD1000000022_S0000033	this concept is a common one in existentialism it is actually one of the main themes in dostoyevsky is book crime and punishment the idea that you know we often think we know a lot more about ourselves than we actually do in practice 2 examples of this
POD1000000022_S0000036	that guy now this man believes beyond a shadow of a doubt that he is napoleon if you sat them down and you asked him candidly no but who are you really deep down inside he would say i am napoleon bonaparte commander of the armies of the north
POD1000000022_S0000037	husband to a modern wife father to a modern son and i will have my vengeance but is this man really napoleon we know he is not napoleon in fact in a weird way as outsiders we seem to have an advantage when it comes to knowing who he really is
POD1000000022_S0000040	i am going to the sporting good section i mean i am going to go up to the rafters like i am tom cruise and snap the dood is neck i am going to do this because that is just the kind of person i am that is me i would sacrifice my life for the greater good now he may tell his friends this
POD1000000022_S0000044	sarah says that when you take a closer look at the self it is not a sole it is not a personality hidden deep within you what we are referring when we talk about the self turns out to be much more complex than that with many more moving parts
POD1000000022_S0000045	and i think a good place to begin if we want to understand sartre is views on what the self really is is to talk about 2 foundational aspects of what it means to be a human being that sartre seemed to be constantly intertwined and dependent upon each other what he calls our factitio
POD1000000022_S0000048	fully affirmative and being for itself as being consciousness or the source of all negotiation well one day when sarah is trying to meet his monthly quota for abscure sounding philosophical descriptions the way he describes the relationship between these 2 entological categories is that being in itself
POD1000000022_S0000049	is what it is and being for itself quote is what it is not well as weird as that sounds in a vacuum after listening to the last episode we all know what he means when he says it but then sarah points out something very misterious a very strange coincidence
POD1000000022_S0000050	when you look at the relationship between these 2 entological categories 2 things that are easy to write off is just these meaningless abstract concepts that start to cooked up one day when you look at how being in itself and being for itself relate to each other
POD1000000022_S0000051	sartre notices there seems to be a similar sort of relationship at the foundation of who we are as people because on one hand all of us have our factitious and factitious is kind of like being in itself it is the fully affirmative set of facts that are true about us
POD1000000022_S0000053	i am scared of spiders things like that right in otherwise statements of facts that are currently true about us that is what makes up our factitious but what sartre would want to consider is that while all these kinds of statements are no doubt useful when it comes to describing certain pieces of who i am
POD1000000022_S0000058	you can start to hear the weird start to description creeping in there just like being in itself is what it is and being for itself is what it is not in a sense i am what i am i have a factitious but i also am what i am not yet
POD1000000022_S0000066	when sartre talks about radical freedom when any of us talk about being individuals that are free to act as they choose we are never talking about total freedom right it is always freedom within certain limitations
POD1000000022_S0000072	but yeah ultimately the point sartre is making here with the concept of facticity and transcendence is not only to stop thinking about yourself as though it is this artifact hidden deep within you inside of a vault but also stop thinking about who you are as though it is this static
POD1000000022_S0000075	unless if you are dead you have never arrived at a destination as a human being now at 1st glance this may seem like sartre is writing a self help book no single fact about you sums up who you are release your inner transcendence no
POD1000000022_S0000076	no like we touched on last time sartre thinks that when people are truly faced with the number of these possibilities they are free to choose from most of the time they do not get excited they are horrified by it in fact most of the time they do not get excited
POD1000000022_S0000077	sartre thinks that the secret cover desire of everyone whether they realize it or not is to escape this duality it is to turn themselves into either pure facticity or pure transcendence or as sartre says we all secretly want to become god
POD1000000022_S0000080	god is perfect as he is pure factitious but on the other hand god is all powerful and capable but bringing about any possibility he wants in other words pure transcendence so sartre would say this is no coincidence
POD1000000022_S0000083	or pure transcendence like god is what sara calls bad faith let us take a look at the most famous example of bad faith that sara lays out and because we are already talked about in the other episode i will keep it brief
POD1000000022_S0000084	sartre talks about sitting in the middle of a cafe in paris watching a water as he does his job now you can imagine a water in the 1940s right dressed up in his little outfit very upright good posture very proper
POD1000000022_S0000085	he holds the tray in a particular way he walks and changes direction in a very militaristic particular way like a good waiter does sarah can not help a point out that this guy does not seem to be a self with facticity and transcendence in this moment
POD1000000022_S0000087	go to most restaurants and you can find some modern version of what sartre is talking about here i mean there is so many servers out there that have fallen into bad faith and are just sort of playing the role of the same person it seems to be a modern archetype of what it is to be a server they all say the same stuff
POD1000000022_S0000088	hi i am john i am going to be taking care of you today can not get you guys started with a bottle of shrimp or some drinks or something but it is at every stage of the meal how is everything tasted for you guys you all save room for desert now there is absolutely no rush i am going to leave the check here and go over there
POD1000000022_S0000090	ask yourself is this the way this guy talks to his mom is this the way he talks to his best friends no he is falling into bad faith and is just playing the part of a server now the point sartre is making is not that waiters need to be more creative it is not about waiters
POD1000000022_S0000091	sartre thinks that as human beings we have a tendency to gravitate towards this trap in all aspects of our life we make proclamations about what we are all the time i am a stay at home mom that is my identity
POD1000000022_S0000094	and we use bad faith to quell this feeling of nazism but we are constantly doing this with ourselves now if all you ever read was sartre is being in nothingness you might get the read from the book that this tendency we have to gravitate towards bad faith
POD1000000022_S0000096	but in one of the footnotes of being in nothingness sartre alludes to a way out of all of it and perhaps to an ethics that he write later on in his life well he never writes an ethics and it may be because you know his life long partner
POD1000000022_S0000097	and fellow existentialists samuel de beauvoir produces what many consider to be the greatest existentialist approach to ethics called the ethics of ambiguity next episode is part 2 on samuel de beauvoir so we are going to be talking all about it but enough of a bad faith let us get back to answering this question who am i
POD1000000022_S0000100	sartre would say you do not have some privileged vip access to the facts that are true about you and the possibilities that you have i mean hypothetically any other person if they were diligent enough has access to your facticity and transcendence
POD1000000022_S0000101	in fact just like the guy that tells himself that he is napoleon sometimes other people are better at telling us who we are than we are but how is this possible the reason is possible because the self is not the christian soul to sartre
POD1000000022_S0000104	no we tell ourselves stories all the time what follows from this is that the true measure of your values the true measure of who you are is what you actually do it is the collection of what you have actually done thus far in your life and sartre says that when you stop looking at the self
POD1000000022_S0000107	that sartre lays out his 3rd entological category what he calls being for others let us talk about what he means sartre would say that an intrinsic part of what it is to be you is existing alongside other people and all the consequences that come along with that
POD1000000022_S0000108	this is sartre is concept of being for others now how does being for others affect my answer to the question who am i well again this concept of the self is outside of us it is an abstraction
POD1000000022_S0000109	and what sartre points out is that there are many aspects about who we are that are given to us by other people for example whether we are trustworthy or not whether or not you are a trustworthy person is an aspect of who you are that is mediated by other people right
POD1000000022_S0000111	and how other people view us seem to be connected to sartre but the flip side of it of being that interconnected is that it leaves us in what he describes as a perpetual state of being judged by the people around us
POD1000000022_S0000114	you will henceforth be known as the weird shoes guy in that person is mind this is constantly going on but sartre is not saying it is always bad that being around other people is some paranoid everybody is thinking bad things about me all the time thing
POD1000000022_S0000115	people very well may be thinking really good things about you all the time the point that sartre wants to make is that this whole dynamic this dynamic of other people seeing you putting you on trial and turning you into pure facticity in their minds this is going on all the time
POD1000000022_S0000121	it may seem to us like we have a sort of special access to knowing who we are and that we choose to share ourselves with only our closest friends who we trust deeply but sarah would say that the reason it seems that way is because what you actually have is a narrative about yourself
POD1000000022_S0000124	is because that is the very criteria we all used to choose who our friends are going to be is whether or not they reinforce this picture that we have of ourselves that is what we like about our friends to sartre
POD1000000022_S0000125	for example if a big part of the way that you view yourself and your identity is that you consider yourself to be a smart person sara would predict that most of your friends are going to be people that are not so smart that tell you you are smart all the time
POD1000000022_S0000126	or people that ask you a lot of questions that you then answer making you feel smart or other smart people that command you on being smart like them to sartre we choose our friends because they reinforce the way that we view ourselves
POD1000000022_S0000128	and of course it is going to feel validating of course it would seem that you know better than anyone else who you are but again sarah would say that the true measure of your values the true answer to the question who are you
POD1000000025_S0000006	i am dave digs
POD1000000025_S0000007	i am raphael casal
POD1000000025_S0000010	it is a little hard to summarize the partnership between david and raphael because as best friends and creative collaborators they have done so much over the years together
POD1000000025_S0000011	let me start individually dave digs won a tony and a grammy for his performance in hamilton
POD1000000025_S0000012	he played thomas jefferson and the marquis de lafayette in the original broadway cast
POD1000000025_S0000014	rafael casal is an actor writer and director he is an award winning slam poet and started appearing on hbo is death poetry jam at the age of 18
POD1000000025_S0000017	and president obama named it one of his favorite movies of the year
POD1000000025_S0000018	blind spotting takes place in ocean which is also where daveed and raphael are from
POD1000000025_S0000019	their story begins at berkeley high school here is daveed
POD1000000025_S0000024	my memory of him in high school is like dick always had like a very nashville way about him
POD1000000025_S0000025	and i do not know that this paints it accurately but this is a representation of it is like at some point diggs was like i am just wearing pajama pants to school every day
POD1000000025_S0000045	so our friend justin was like you guys should work together you are 2 of my favorite wrappers
POD1000000025_S0000075	i do not have the technical skill set that raffi has so like he was so fast in pro tools
POD1000000025_S0000095	this is also great let us now he says we at this moment as really braffa was known right
POD1000000025_S0000098	he got named one of those but raven never would take that for himself and it was always like us
POD1000000025_S0000116	they did not understand digs very much at all i feel like the more commercial bay area scene
POD1000000025_S0000124	we were slumming it so hard and we got to lay we were so poor diggs was delivering talko
POD1000000025_S0000129	and we did 5 years in la before digs went to new york to do hamilton
POD1000000025_S0000130	i think that was one of those things that came about for digs really organically
POD1000000025_S0000131	hamilton was such an interesting like music like it was a play that was like legit written for him to flex all of the things he is good at
POD1000000025_S0000134	and then the world saw digs in the light that best showed everything and they not only accepted but ubessed over it
POD1000000025_S0000136	and the 1st thing that happened is this girl grabs my arm and looks at digs and goes 0 my god is that dave digs to me
POD1000000025_S0000137	and i like start to realize that this woman is anna hathaway like and she is like fan gurling out
POD1000000025_S0000140	robert is like calling and texting and emailing and i am like getting back to the degree that i can
POD1000000025_S0000142	i remember like had somebody turning ages and i was like i am thinking about moving to new york so you will respond more in person
POD1000000025_S0000143	i heard digs goes i did not want to ask
POD1000000025_S0000166	and so i would written this poem about sort of like the numbness of that experience of like god is this like what life is
POD1000000025_S0000170	digs he finishes this massive sensation in new york he had like 30 days in june that he could shoot this movie
POD1000000025_S0000177	it is just fun in meetings post blind spotting now that we are associated together in this way and also people have been able to see that raphael is a great actor as well as a great writer
POD1000000025_S0000181	the closest i have ever gotten to fighting with raphael i think is like when somebody else i am close to is fighting with raphael right
POD1000000025_S0000189	dave digs and raphael casal are partners
POD1000000025_S0000191	you can follow them on twitter or instagram at david digs and at raphael casal raphael probably still has the passwords to david is accounts
POD1000000025_S0000192	partners is made by me rich kisher her way i produced edited and made the music for the show
POD1000000025_S0000193	with editing help on this episode from marion hoban and zack mcnees partners is a male champ podcast made in partnership with radio topia
POD1000000027_S0000009	you are listening to 30 for 30 podcast my name is joe avergan welcome to our 5th season of original audio documentaries as we have done before we are divoting the entire season to one story it is told over 5 parts
POD1000000027_S0000013	for this season we are excited to work with espn is ramona shelburn one of our top n b a reporters an l a native and someone who has been covering this story from the moment it broke
POD1000000027_S0000014	romona is your host for all 5 episodes a quick word of warning this season contains mature subject matter and language and now coming up after the break from 30 for 30 and the undefeated the sterling affairs
POD1000000027_S0000016	shelly sterling thought she was just going to return some clothes to namin marcus when she got in her mascadian ben station wagon and made the drive from mala bu to beverly hills it was early in the spring of 2014
POD1000000027_S0000017	and even though shelly was almost 80 years old she was still going into town as rich people call beverly hills 4 or 5 days a week it is hard to guess shelly is age if you do not know it
POD1000000027_S0000019	there are the iconic brown and yellow signs that let you know you have entered a special place and shelly sterling and her husband donald own a ton of it
POD1000000027_S0000022	but most people knew her husband donald sterling as the long time owner of the los angeles clippers one of the worst owners in all of sports his team was the laughing stock of the nba for decades
POD1000000027_S0000023	for shelly it should have been would have been just a got down roadie drive to return some wildly expensive clothes but unbeknownst to her her husband was also at namin markus that day
POD1000000027_S0000024	with a woman 49 years his junior named v stiviano she was not the 1st mistress not even close but v was something different
POD1000000027_S0000026	shelly told me that story when we met in the winter of 2019 at the beverly hills plasa hotel or by hotel as she calls it
POD1000000027_S0000027	shelly was 84 at the time but she can tell that story of that run in with donald and v 5 years earlier with exacting detail
POD1000000027_S0000028	i happened to be there to return something and she was there with donald and with some other friends and we had a big confrontation she was very very very nasty and mean to me
POD1000000027_S0000029	what happened was that she ran into shelly i think at north stream and they started talking and i guess things got out of hand
POD1000000027_S0000030	that is matt nehora and when i told shelly sterling his version of the story she scoffed
POD1000000027_S0000032	at 1st i thought it was funny that shelly took the time to correct him i mean here is a woman talking to a female reporter about her husband is infidelity who cares whether you confront your husband is mistress outside of neiman marcus or norton is
POD1000000027_S0000034	that in the end led to one of the biggest scandals in professional sports a controversy that forced the n b a to finally deal with donald sterling after decades of his bad behavior and had ripple effects throughout the entire league
POD1000000027_S0000036	this is the sterling affairs from 3434 podcasts and the undefeated i am ramona shelburn
POD1000000027_S0000041	i learned pretty quickly that there is no other owner in basketball with quite the same personality or ego as donald sterling sterling was not a basketball guy he was a personal injury lawyer and then he got filthy rich off a real estate
POD1000000027_S0000047	but rich people like donald sterling multi $10 rich people do not live in the same world as the rest of us do not play by the same rules when you have enough money it is like your rubber everything just bounces off of you
POD1000000027_S0000048	even 3 decades of driving an n b a franchise into the ground when you are as rich as donald and shelly you get to tell yourself that everything is fabulous
POD1000000027_S0000060	and donald sterling is life was fabulous why would he think otherwise nobody ever questioned him to his face anyway he did whatever he wanted he said whatever he wanted he had relationships with whomver he wanted
POD1000000027_S0000062	i did not know v stivano back then and yes that is her real name v just the letter v with a period she was born maria vanessa perez
POD1000000027_S0000063	but change her name to v stiviano at about the same time she would met donald that a superball party in 2010 before that she had been trying desperately to climb out of the poverty that she would grown up in
POD1000000027_S0000064	she had been running a food truck business and trying to work away on to reality tv shows and causing up to whom ever was the most relevant powerful or famous then she met donald
POD1000000027_S0000067	money in her maze bags or gifts and never ever humiliate the wife but vestavia no either did not know or did not care because she broke every last rule in the mistress terms and agreements
POD1000000027_S0000068	she went right at shelly
POD1000000027_S0000071	she kept telling people she was going to be the next miss sterling
POD1000000027_S0000072	kathryn baumann is one of shelly is best friends and a long time clippers fan
POD1000000027_S0000073	she would stock shelly she would watch where shelly would go and then she would show up and i do remember at the one time she went into the restroom where shelly was just paraded around showed off herself then shelly walked out
POD1000000027_S0000074	at clippers games the entire extended stirring universe was usually there and usually just feet from one another sometimes shelly and donald sat in their court side seats together and v sat in her seats directly across the court
POD1000000027_S0000075	other nights v would sit next to donald and shelly was no where to be seen but clipper players like ryan hollins and matt barnes got used to v being around you could not not notice her
POD1000000027_S0000078	clippers employees often got caught in the middle of this bizarre triangle shelly would call team president andy roger demanding that v not be allowed in the building and then donald would call roger and ask him to leave 4 tickets for her
POD1000000027_S0000079	these were relationships begging to implode but none of the entangled ever tried to solve the problem donald shelly v each kept pushing each other waiting for someone to break
POD1000000027_S0000080	well the breaking started on christmas day 2012 ve called the sterling house asking to speak to donald
POD1000000027_S0000082	shelly was mortified the family was sitting at the dinner table waiting for donald as he is passing on the tennis courts outside fighting with his mistress
POD1000000027_S0000085	the fight with shelly started when he hung up
POD1000000027_S0000086	not that that was uncommon even without fee they fought often but this was escalating shelly and donald is youngest son scott had to step in before he got physical he confronted his father and demanded he stop this nonsense with
POD1000000027_S0000091	a week later scott died
POD1000000027_S0000100	shelly was devastated
POD1000000027_S0000103	it was not just that the fight with v was a last volatile moment between donald and
POD1000000027_S0000105	when scott died donald stayed with fee established of going home to his wife as she greaved too much she kicked don out of the house
POD1000000027_S0000107	shelly needed breathing room and i think don had pushed the envelope a little too far
POD1000000027_S0000110	but shelly and donald had been together too long been through too much together had too much of their lives and their money intertwined
POD1000000027_S0000112	they did not divorce the situation simply continued to deteriorate over the next year as donald spent more and more time with v
POD1000000027_S0000114	plus shelly was starting to learn about the gifts thee posted pictures on instagram thee driving the $240000 red ferrari that donald had bought her
POD1000000027_S0000115	and the range rover and the 2 bentleys shelly also found out that donald had bought v a $180 duplex
POD1000000027_S0000117	it was not the 1st time the 2 women had run into each other or argued but this time shelly decided she would had enough
POD1000000027_S0000119	on march 7th 2014 shelly sterling filed a lawsuit in california superior court against v stiviano seeking the return of all those gifts from donald
POD1000000027_S0000121	donald and shelly sterling were with multiple 10s of dollars and had done what the ultra rich do put all their money and property into a joint trust
POD1000000027_S0000122	every dime that the sterling spent cost each of them a nickle therefore shelly argued the money that donald used to pay for the gifts was just as much hers as it was his
POD1000000027_S0000123	so she turned to the courts i of if that sounds a little extreme well you do not know the sterlings calling a lawyer how they get out of bed in the morning
POD1000000027_S0000126	she kept saying to donald you better have her drop the lawsuit and he would say 0 she will not really go through with it but she is just doing it for effect and she says well she better drop the lawsuit
POD1000000027_S0000127	but here is how the lawsuit the courtroom product of a bedroom dispute really came to change everything for some time now v had been recording her conversations with donald
POD1000000027_S0000128	sweetie and i am sorry
POD1000000027_S0000130	and according to v and her lawyer donald was aware she was making the tapes
POD1000000027_S0000135	she recorded 100s of conversations over the past 2 years a lot of the recordings were mundane boring even but some of the recordings were arguments and captured decided donald that he would never want his wife or anyone else to hear
POD1000000027_S0000137	no matter what the original intent of those tapes was they became something v could use as blackmail because v stiviano had no intention of returning those gifts from donald
POD1000000027_S0000139	v says to donald i want that bitch wife of your law suit dismissed
POD1000000027_S0000140	pierce 0 donnell is shelly sterling is lover
POD1000000027_S0000141	and he tried to get shelly dismissed and she would not do it
POD1000000027_S0000142	if donald could not or would not fix the situation v decided she would take matters into her own hands it was time to use the tapes
POD1000000027_S0000143	to reveal donald sterling for who he really was
POD1000000027_S0000161	on april ninth 2014 a clippers executive assistant texted v on behalf of donald
POD1000000027_S0000166	mister sterling said to let me know if you need anything you do not want to have any issues at the game
POD1000000027_S0000178	it was shocking the clipper is assistant immediately emailed the file to clipper is president andy roger and that is how shelly learned about the tape too
POD1000000027_S0000180	and i said well what is the tape about so i said to andy andy roeser i said andy what are you doing about this and he says 0 well she will never do anything
POD1000000027_S0000181	roger had worked for donald sterling for nearly 3 decades he did what everybody learns to do after a while stay out of the really ugly stuff
POD1000000027_S0000182	donald and shelly had cleaned up their own mess for 6 decades he figured they would eventually make this one go away too but they did not shelly told her lawyers about the tape
POD1000000027_S0000183	and they in turn went to v stiviano and demanded to hear them and that is when v stiviano made her big move
POD1000000027_S0000186	mike walters was the news director at tmz at the time now he runs his own celebrity news site the blast
POD1000000027_S0000187	the 1st thing i did was say who is donald sterling i had heard the name i knew that donald sterling was important but i had no idea that he owned the clippers
POD1000000027_S0000201	the fact is shelly and several people in the clippers organization heard the recording and decided not to act on it or were not appalled enough to act on it maybe they did not understand how big a splash this type could make
POD1000000027_S0000209	so mike walters called up the n b a their new commissioner adam silver had barely been in office for 3 months
POD1000000027_S0000210	i actually had never heard of adam silver until that day
POD1000000027_S0000217	after calling the league tmc called the clippers to let them know they were about to publish a tape that would be very damaging to donald sterling
POD1000000027_S0000218	if you are donald sterling there is never a good time to have your girlfriend out you as a racist if you are the clippers this could not have happened at a worse moment donald sterling is clippers had been a laughing stock for decades
POD1000000027_S0000220	i mean because honestly like these clippers jokes are something we they are not even jokes they are statements of fact
POD1000000027_S0000222	in the 30 some odd years he would own the team they would only made the playoff 6 times they would never even move past the semifinals that had all started to change in the late 2000s though the team had drafted a star blake griffin
POD1000000027_S0000223	nba rookie of the year blake griffin
POD1000000027_S0000225	and then ended up with another star chris paul
POD1000000027_S0000226	louisiana is electric with the addition of chris paul to the clippers
POD1000000027_S0000231	in time for this season the clippers had also managed to get themselves one of the best coaches in the nba doc rivers
POD1000000027_S0000232	it is doc rivers to the clippers 3 years $210
POD1000000027_S0000240	once the clippers staff found out tmz was going to publish the tape andy rozer went to coach doc rivers maybe he needed him to talk to the team before the story broke
POD1000000027_S0000241	andy i remember coming in my office one day and said hey there is a tape that tmz has it is going to come out it is not that flattering but it is not a big deal honestly i thought it was a 2nd tape because of donald sterling i really did
POD1000000027_S0000242	so doc did as he was told and gathered the players and warned them that something was coming superstar clippers forward blake griffin and senor ryan hollins were in that room
POD1000000027_S0000243	dock gathered us
POD1000000027_S0000244	doug said hey guys we need to meet and talk
POD1000000027_S0000253	an audio recording proposedly of louisiana clippers owner donald sterling making racist remarks to his girlfriend is being investigated by the national basketball association
POD1000000027_S0000268	like tms mike walters soon as i heard that tape i knew this was going to be huge
POD1000000027_S0000270	sterlingly has a long history of questionable behavior
POD1000000027_S0000273	within hours the audio of donald sterling making racist remarks to virginia had gone viral
POD1000000027_S0000278	by morning lebron james the biggest star in the league was saying there is no room for a person like donald sterling in the nba
POD1000000027_S0000280	and across the country adam silver was facing his 1st real crisis
POD1000000027_S0000281	nba commissioner adam silver sitting down in memphis addressing the comments made by donald sterling
POD1000000027_S0000284	i am not yet prepared to discuss any potential sanctions against donald sterling we will however move extraordinarily quickly in our investigation
POD1000000027_S0000286	if it was sterling on those tapes if they had not been doctored or altered silver knew he wanted to punish him severely the league was outraged
POD1000000027_S0000287	because on top of donald sterling saying all those unforgivably racist things sterling was also taking shots at one of the most beloved figures in all of basketball magic johnson
POD1000000027_S0000289	it was as shocking and as bizarre as anything on the tape that a picture of v stiviano and magic johnson had set him off to hear donald sterling talk that way about magic
POD1000000027_S0000290	the guy who turned the lakers into a dinosaur who fought off hiv that is the guy donald sterling told his mistress was not welcome at his games
POD1000000027_S0000294	even the famously a political michael jordan voiced his outrage
POD1000000027_S0000295	michael jordan wade in there is no room in the n b a or anywhere else for the kind of racism and hatred that mister sterling allegedly expressed we cannot tolerate must not tolerate discrimination at any level
POD1000000027_S0000298	it is like what one of the paparazzi who was tailing donald and sally told me it had all the elements sex money sports politics greed racism
POD1000000027_S0000299	it had everything it even had the visor you remember the visor that def punk welding mask meets florida grandma visor that v stiviano worked anytime she stepped outside of her house
POD1000000027_S0000300	but still saying nothing is v stiviano not late this afternoon when she arrived home or when she left tonight wearing different clothes but color coordinated face shields
POD1000000027_S0000302	have you talked to mister sterling can you explain the mask
POD1000000027_S0000306	by the end of the weekend the 1st black president of the united states was answering questions about sterling
POD1000000027_S0000309	the tapes dominated the news cycle not just because they were juicy but because donald sterling was articulating something deeper more shameful
POD1000000027_S0000314	including ryan hollins
POD1000000027_S0000318	los angeles sits on 2 fault lines san andreas and race all of us know it we live with it donald sterling was another
POD1000000027_S0000319	anyone who played for him or worked for him or covered him in the press or lived in one of his 100s of apartments on the one hand knew that it was all a matter of time until he blew up the underlying issues with sterling were well known and well documented
POD1000000027_S0000320	but like most insanely wealthy white men in america donald had managed to wiggle bully and fight his way out of all of him he knew how to play his leverage and power outlast his adversaries and win if you can call it that
POD1000000029_S0000002	from american public media this is market place tech demistifying the digital economy i am jack stewart in for molly wood
POD1000000029_S0000006	nearly every crisis facebook now faces stems from that nicholas thompson editor and chief of wired says that is left management navigate a metaphorical minefield
POD1000000029_S0000010	secondly one of the smartest business decisions that mark zuckerberg ever made was to buy instagram and people do not really understand that instagram is owned by facebook or if they distrust facebook they do not distrust instagram so instagram continues to grow
POD1000000029_S0000023	absolutely what are the stakes to their business they are very high if scandal continues to multiply there could be real consequences down the road what are the stakes specifically to top management meaning mark zuckerberg and charles samberg the 2 people who we most associate with the company
POD1000000029_S0000024	for zuckerberg he is going to run the company as long as he wants to he has you know voting control of the shares he is appointed his friends as board members he is in a good position
POD1000000029_S0000025	whenever he wants to go and run the chan zuckerberg initiative or just go be an intellectual thought leader or do bill gates type things he will go choose to do that for samberg it is tougher
POD1000000029_S0000026	and there were moments in the last year where it seemed like she might be sacrificed or where she might be in big trouble zuckerberg has expressed his loyalty to her
POD1000000029_S0000036	there was one specific story that stunned me and that was the circumstances that led to the departure of the 2 founders of instagram kevin systrom and mike krieger
POD1000000029_S0000037	and when fred vogelstein and i started reporting the story we made a list of the mysteries we wanted to solve and that was at the very top why had they left it seems strange they had left all of a sudden in september
POD1000000029_S0000038	no one knew why and late in their reporting you know months into reporting the story we finally learned to the full story and that is that according to people close to them they had grown frustrated with zuckerberg is increased meddling
POD1000000029_S0000040	and there was a sense among some people at facebook that instagram is growth was coming at the expense of core facebook and that led to all kinds of tensions and then a big fight at the end of july and a moment where mark zuckerberg
POD1000000029_S0000042	and then he gave the list to kevin systrom and said we are getting rid of all of these and according to people familiar with the story systrom reacted quite badly to that and then went on personal leave came back and said i am done here
POD1000000029_S0000043	and so the biggest surprise to us was that the departure of systrom and krieger which had not come out before was much tender much tender than i had believed when i began reporting this story
POD1000000029_S0000044	nick thompson editor and chief of wired for context a $50 fine would be a record tech penalty in the us beating the 220 that google had to pay in 2012
POD1000000029_S0000049	if you enjoyed mark zuckerberg is testimony in front of congress here in the us with his singing comebacks like senator we run ads then maybe you will enjoy hearing more directly from mister zuckerberg himself
POD1000000029_S0000050	i mean facebook was accused of not being open enough i am not really sure how deep into the heads of tech entrepreneurs you really want to get but zuck does have a podcast now i am not suggesting you listen i am just giving you this information

POD1000000047_S0000000	welcome to the 80000 ours podcast this interview with david spiegelhalter is a bit unusual and that it was actually recorded 2 years ago
POD1000000047_S0000002	we were considering starting a podcast back then and i recorded this trial episode with my colleague jess whittlestone but ultimately we did not have the time to go ahead with the project but i thought why not dig it up and release it now
POD1000000047_S0000004	david spiegelhalter is a statistician at the university of cambridge and something of an academic celebrity in the uk
POD1000000047_S0000016	to help us answer some of these questions we are joined by a professor david spiegelhalter the winton professor for the public understanding of risk at cambridge university professor spiegelhalter spent much of his life trying to improve public understanding of statistics science and risk in ordinary life
POD1000000047_S0000115	yeah i have actually written an article with a professor terry ord about why we should not discount health even though we should discount financial returns but why why it is appropriate in one case and not in the other so we will put up a link to that on the website
POD1000000047_S0000244	yeah i think that is about all we have got time for now but thanks so much david this has been very informative and really interesting
POD1000000047_S0000247	right if you would like to hear more from professor spike halter then you can find his blog understanding uncertainty online and he is also often on the radio in the uk in particular on more or less on bbc 4
POD1000000048_S0000001	hi i am rob director of research at 8000 hours today i am speaking with miles brundage research fellow at the university of oxford is future of humanity institute
POD1000000048_S0000003	miles research has been supported by the national science foundation the by partisan policy center and the future of life institute so thanks for making time to talk to us today miles
POD1000000048_S0000051	and moles you have a forthcoming guide to work on ai policy and strategy that that we are going to link to so here we are going to try to go go beyond that so if you find yourself a little bit confused then potentially just go and read one of those one of those documents 1st
POD1000000048_S0000059	so there has been a little bit of work for example by armstrong at all at the future of humanity institute looking at arms race type scenarios involving ai where there would be an incentive to skimp
POD1000000048_S0000095	so the example i mentioned of the paper by armstrong at all called racing to the precisis is is one example and it presented sort of a stark version of the arm race scenario
POD1000000048_S0000100	progress to be made so there was a paper put out by the feature of the main institute by nick bostrom carrick flynn and alick of alan and defoe recently that looks at policy discordanta for the development of machine super intelligence
POD1000000048_S0000116	another resource that comes to mind is a syllabus for a class on the global politics of ai developed by alan dafo at yale and the feature of humanity institute
POD1000000048_S0000191	so otherwise i i would say that that is a good place to to go so and likewise we do not really know what the agenda of the trump administration is on the ai front
POD1000000048_S0000314	yeah and i i suppose you you can always just track the things that you know people like you or nick bostrom is saying and and how you speak about the issue so that so that you do not come across as a alarmist and you you have a measured and a precise tone
POD1000000048_S0000338	so you know there are people at fahi who also are affiliated with the center for effective alternatives and involved in you know building the aa community like owen and connor barratt and tony ord
POD1000000048_S0000350	and it took the work of nick bostrom and super intelligence and stewart russell in giving a lot of talks and writing up papers to call more attention to it and give it more legitimacy
YOU1000000000_S0000003	hi and welcome back i am mike quinn is
YOU1000000000_S0000009	so to take us through the process ryan how do you decide what do you drive every night

YOU1000000020_S0000088	specifically why this so why this scenario is kept in plastic is that it actually singularly one ralph is beta black load

YOU1000000020_S0000183	jacob wilson has been utterly dominant this weekend but he just suffered a brutal loss in the hands of aron froling and if he does not make the top 8 that last play is going to come back to honda

YOU1000000020_S0000198	how do you feel as seth manfield right now

YOU1000000020_S0000215	jacob is in game and 3 and a 2 out of 3
YOU1000000020_S0000216	yelger wegishima who is a dutch health of fame magic player so not an easy opponent
YOU1000000020_S0000218	game on yelger had an instant win combo that involved making an infinite number of ferries that all attack at once for infinite damage
YOU1000000020_S0000219	and then in game 2 jacob was able to survive despite the fact that yelger rained an anger of the gods that destroyed all of jacob is creatures
YOU1000000020_S0000220	but then jacob summoned an elephant soldier called loxodon smider and that finished the job and killed yelger in game 2 so now we are on to game 3
YOU1000000020_S0000221	jacob has got a very good start but the one the girls deck is capable of winning in an eye blink so the suppens is pretty good
YOU1000000020_S0000223	voice of research he is running through what could he have jacob does not have a lot of outs here things are not looking good for him
YOU1000000020_S0000225	going to put this splunter twin on this pesticide do you have a response shows the path to exile to yelger who now will show him the dispensary
YOU1000000020_S0000228	the game there is a hand yeah ye
YOU1000000020_S0000230	another great performance from young jacob wilson but it was not quite enough against the dutch hall of famer i know this has to be so disappointing for him
YOU1000000020_S0000232	you are graded on how many top hats you have achieved i think that ultimately jacob is going to embrace that fact
YOU1000000020_S0000254	i am here with our champion jacob wilson congratulations man i am giving you a handshake i am a little bit of hardware you are no stranger to this
YOU1000000023_S0000002	fire emblem is turning 30 next year and with 16 main games and a few spin offs it is safe to say that it has grown into something extraordinary the games are packed with deep story lines and memorable characters like marth
YOU1000000023_S0000003	that is not marth marth that is which one is marth
YOU1000000023_S0000005	march
YOU1000000023_S0000022	that way the audience could be like 0 that does wearing a tight fitting suit with a bunch of weird patches that must be arlecchino the servant clown sometimes to 2 masters this brought the audience in immediately they knew what that character was about without any exposition
YOU1000000023_S0000027	can and abel are battle brows they fight together but not in the biblical sense board and cords are similar except they are usually ax fighters pegasus sisters are a trio of flying horses ladies
YOU1000000023_S0000028	you can not split these archetypes up into their solo characters because their bond is what defines them you can not have a waluigi without alouigi and in the same way you can not have a board without a cord which is my favorite doctor susan
YOU1000000023_S0000029	jaguars are mentors that are strong at the beginning and then you will quickly outpace them and it is kind of sad like the 1st time you beat your dad in a basketball game 0 phases are similar to jaguars except they will keep dunking on you until you are dead
YOU1000000023_S0000030	wendels are mentors but for magic goats are mentors but only the last half of the game bay wolves are mercenaries that you have to pay actual in game currency to recruit and ogmas are mercenaries that usually decide to join you out of their own volition
YOU1000000023_S0000034	you can not get the other kind of like if 2 of your friends start dating and then have a really messy breakup cornelius is are usually the parental figure to the main character and they have this nasty habit of getting axed super early on in the game
YOU1000000023_S0000035	it is kind of like fire emblem does not know how to make interesting characters without making them suffer tragic perennial death
YOU1000000023_S0000049	but before i get there i just want to commend fire emblem for having 596 playable characters and only repeating 3 names when i was hired for my 1st job at a climbing gym i was one of 5 employees named brian
YOU1000000023_S0000054	that took like 30 minutes but let us begin the honorable night like fiona who cares passionately about her people and will always oppose crude to civilians
YOU1000000023_S0000055	which is way better than the loyal night like trude who only is loyal to pern and will do literally anything for him even though pern is a bad dude but i will get to that later
YOU1000000023_S0000059	but that is not my fault super smash should have included more magic babies arguments hotheads and edge lords all have a mean side but arguments like vicky just think they are the best hotheads like caspar want to fight anything that moves
YOU1000000023_S0000060	an edge lords like niles retweet jocker accounts unironically a lot of these characters have rough childhoods but then turn out cheerful despite that and then there is the inferior complex archetype which i could have just called the majority of children and fire emblem fates
YOU1000000023_S0000061	mischief makers and flutes are all highly motivated but subbaki is motivated to meet high expectations claud is motivated to make intrigue schemes and silvane is motivated to be a fuckboy
YOU1000000023_S0000062	buss kills are just characters that are not very fun to talk to and fire religious deadbeat dad gilbert it also does not help that i look like hannibal light
YOU1000000023_S0000064	0 god am i a buskill a lot of these archetypes are based around one singular personality trait scarlet straight forward valbar is chill linhart is lazy suemas clummy petra is a sweetie and ranulf is a farmer
YOU1000000023_S0000066	child soldier karen is canonically 14 years old
YOU1000000023_S0000069	manuela is constantly drinking and flirting and just being a hot mess and i love her for it and that makes her the president of vices
YOU1000000023_S0000070	the vice president but be careful not to do that around someone like astram who is constantly accusing people of treason for no good reason
YOU1000000023_S0000072	here is an archetype i call what the fuck and it is the 3 characters that make me say what the fuck fire emblem people like pern who is said to be a sweet robin hood type except he does kidnap a young girl and keeps her as his slave
YOU1000000023_S0000073	or tharja who practices curses on her own daughter or roger who is actually he is not actually that bad
YOU1000000023_S0000074	but fire emblem does go out of their way to make his end screen say that he never gets a date and he stays single for the rest of his life and it is like what the fuck fire emblem you did not have to do him during like that
YOU1000000023_S0000075	the next archetype is called actually pretty interesting these characters are 3 dimensional and well developed people like lebra who struggles with his faith and has incredible self doubt even though he is doing all he can to help those around him
YOU1000000023_S0000076	or rhys who dreams of being a sword fighter but his weak constitution will not allow him to become one and so he helps in the ways he can but his whole story is one of unfulfilled dreams
YOU1000000023_S0000078	and that is it those are the only 2 interesting characters and fire emblem until we get to raphael my sweet bucky boy who only cares about eating and training and not about studying
YOU1000000023_S0000094	and that just sounds like a pretty run of the mill awkward family reunion when you think about it these ones are just their strange characters that have that are good i mean if you include dmitry in this he has an iphone app
YOU1000000023_S0000095	which is similar to these one and bileth have they we also i dorthea wears a hat until she grows out of the hat about that do not even get me started on abo
YOU1000000023_S0000101	you know the servant sometimes to 2 masters
YOU1000000023_S0000106	all that does when in a tight fitting suit with a bunch of weird patches it must be arlecino the server cloud sometimes the 2 masters okay
YOU1000000029_S0000001	the polls have closed in 3 more states at 730 in the east at this point bill clinton has 58 electoral votes bob dole nothing yet
YOU1000000029_S0000003	cnn coverage of election 96 live from cnn center where our judy woodruff bernard shaw phil schneider and ken bodie
YOU1000000029_S0000005	and the biggest electoral prize at this half hour we can tell you is the state of ohio c and n calls that the state of ohio has been won by president clinton this is a big victory can bodie for the democrats
YOU1000000029_S0000007	sean and declares that bill clinton has one west virginia is 5 electoral votes
YOU1000000029_S0000010	judy this is fairly typical for north carolina this is a generally republican state and presidential races but george bush won this state by less than one last time he is very closest state
YOU1000000029_S0000019	now let us move over to the electrical map to show you what we have so far president clinton leading bob dole 58 electrical votes the magic number is 270
YOU1000000029_S0000023	in this half hour florida before that those are 2 big states and both in the clinton column
YOU1000000029_S0000025	so well we have is the republicans and a little bit of difficulty here
YOU1000000029_S0000027	well canada and indiana is fascinating that is just fascinating and and and the word was that if if dole started out in trouble in canada and indiana if he lost them out right
YOU1000000029_S0000030	in june he said if bob dole this he calls himself bob dole he says if bob dole does not win canada bob dole can not win the presidency well we do not know yet but it is a tight
YOU1000000029_S0000031	let us take a look now at the states that we know one or the other has one and here it is for president clinton floyd you have been hearing this new hampshire ohio vermont and west virginia
YOU1000000029_S0000036	bill schneider you want to take over with the your act policies here and and i will save a thought i had
YOU1000000029_S0000037	okay we are going to take a look at the state of ohio a big win for bill clinton and see how did he do it well 13rd of the voters in ohio were union members in the household
YOU1000000029_S0000038	and they clearly went a majority a solid majority for bill clinton that big afl cio pushed for the democrats and for the democratic president paid off in ohio
YOU1000000029_S0000040	now let us look at the voters who decided how they were going to vote just in the last 3 days how did they end up voting well they voted for bob dole it looks like bob dole talked about his momentum in the last few days
YOU1000000029_S0000042	they were the ones who delivered for bill clinton and that was 70% of the voters in ohio so while doll picked up some late momentum
YOU1000000029_S0000044	you are very good with that john madden not to be jellous tonight
YOU1000000029_S0000048	live from washington crossfire on the left jeraldine ferraro on the right robert novak in the crossfire
YOU1000000029_S0000049	republican senator john mccain of arizona advisor to the dole campaign and in new orleans democratic senator john brown
YOU1000000029_S0000051	good morning welcome to crossfire finally election day came with bill clinton casting his vote in the renovated train station at little rock arkansas and bob dole voting at the 1st christian church in russellville cansas
YOU1000000029_S0000052	the other 10s of americans voting today decided ¢35 contests and 435 house races as well as the presidency president clinton is heavily favored for a 2nd term
YOU1000000029_S0000053	and the big question is who controls congress what the republicans narrowly favor jerry
YOU1000000029_S0000057	talking about we have had ohio that is gone for clinton we have contucky which dolly said was a a must win state too close to call
YOU1000000029_S0000058	you see that that florida has gone to president clinton if if doll is in trouble in the south do you see any scenario by which he could win this presidency tonight
YOU1000000029_S0000059	well jerry it is as i mentioned before we went on i just came off of the 96 hour trip with century doll we saw enthusiasm every place we went i think that california is still in play
YOU1000000029_S0000060	think that there is a lot of southern states that went for president clinton last time and i certainly think that even though they may be quote undecided i still believe connecticut and indiana for example will go
YOU1000000029_S0000061	for senator dole but i i i do not discount the importance of florida and ohio they are important states
YOU1000000029_S0000062	so that so that with all things being equal if if this trend continues senator dole will stay in washington or go back to cannes but not be present in the united states
YOU1000000029_S0000067	my feeling is that we pick up like one seat i am sure that john breaux may have a different of view but i think we would pick up the 4 southern open democrat seats
YOU1000000029_S0000069	senator john breaux this is a very good news for president clinton but i wonder if you are popping champagne corks yet
YOU1000000029_S0000072	bob you must be struggling this is devastating news for senator dole in a sense when you do not not carry ohio which every republican president has always carried and you lose florida that is very bad news for senator dole
YOU1000000029_S0000073	as far as we are winning an electoral victory and we are not finished voting here in louisiana we got about an hour and a half left and i am very confident that mary landrieu will be victorious
YOU1000000029_S0000074	i think i would agree with john mccain my friend that the center is going to be very close i would not be surprised if it was 5149 either way
YOU1000000029_S0000076	but i i i just would like you to address my my initial question senator on on how you can square the apparent big victory of president clinton
YOU1000000029_S0000079	because of what he says or she says in their respective states it is not that connected to the presidential election i think you can have people voting for president clinton and perhaps voting for a republican senator
YOU1000000029_S0000081	is not it true that the problem is that some of your candidates in the south like mary landreau and louisiana and max cleland and georgia were election year moderates they have been liberals all their life and perhaps the voters saw through them
YOU1000000029_S0000082	bob is really interesting they charging mary landrieu with being a liberal here is a person who supports the death penalty supports carrying concealed weapons in louisiana and also will support a constitutional amendment to balance the budget that does not sound very liberal
YOU1000000029_S0000088	bob there you go again falling for some of the republican rhetoric she clearly has said that she would have voted it just like me and benny johnson on that issue but her opponent and others keep saying well that is not her position that is what she said very clearly
YOU1000000029_S0000092	cross fire is brought to you by lci international a very different long distance phone company and by chrisler and the cam forward satan of chrisler what is new in your world
YOU1000000029_S0000094	welcome back to crossfire we are talking about election 96 with senator john mccain republican of arizona and adolf advisor in new orleans senator john brown democrat of louisiana
YOU1000000029_S0000097	are you guys going to go after the clinton administration again for another 4 years or are you going to you are going to get down to some serious work in the senate for a change
YOU1000000029_S0000098	jerry could i mention what real quick before answer and that is that we are pleased to see the closure in the popular vote as you know many of the poles like abc had president clinton by 16 in the teens
YOU1000000029_S0000102	we just saw in the front page of the new york times today mister riady had what 12 visits
YOU1000000029_S0000107	well what i hope is that we have a howard baker on the democrat side as they did during watergate a by partisan democrat will say look we have got to look into this and we have got to go at it
YOU1000000029_S0000110	i will i will take you up on that john breaux are you ready to play the role of howard baker and ask bill clinton what did he know and when did he know it about this launched money from indonesia
YOU1000000029_S0000111	bob the problem is by participant is a by participant problem just yesterday one person who was a supporter and worked for the dole campaign confessed to making a $120000 ilegal contribution
YOU1000000029_S0000112	i think the american people want us to to look at some new campaign finance reform john mccain i think as a leader on this issue with along with our democratic side that is what i think the people want they want to make sure we do it right in the future
YOU1000000029_S0000116	well well john is a realistic ohioana politician and you are one of the best of them would you agree with me that a lot is at stake tonight for the president
YOU1000000035_S0000003	one being the feared and ancient kangle
YOU1000000035_S0000016	today i am visiting carl westfield in the uk who is guardian of several kangles

YOU1000000035_S0000035	i met carl is 2 kangles and the 1st thing that hit me was how lovely they were really effective and welcoming of strangers
YOU1000000035_S0000036	dave his male kangal just wanted to be petted and loved to roll over and fall down in my lap
YOU1000000035_S0000037	the 2 dogs had an obvious roving curiosity and carl mentioned that he preferred to keep them leashed
YOU1000000035_S0000040	well carl these are beautiful beautiful dogs and this is the 1st time i have ever met a cangle dog you get this sort of idea when people go on about them being
YOU1000000035_S0000043	you know a a a good kangal is completely solid temperament basically car carm and till rows
YOU1000000035_S0000059	let us just quickly talk about dave is ears here because i know people comment a lot about crop ears
YOU1000000035_S0000061	when they have been very very young and of course a little dave here is a is an import so he is he is not being cropped here in the uk
YOU1000000035_S0000062	and carl certainly does not crop any of the ears and of course as you can see here on the facebook this is what there is a suppose to look like
YOU1000000035_S0000090	it is it is forn with a black mask
YOU1000000035_S0000115	later that week i dropped by to meet a very special lady indeed sheila read respected across the uk for her expertise in the kangle breed
YOU1000000035_S0000116	both her and her husband michael had kept cangles for decades now and had traveled out to turkey many times to source dogs from working lines
YOU1000000035_S0000120	our old dog had died and we just wanted we wanted a natural dog we went to see a lady called miss betty marshall
YOU1000000035_S0000121	and she bought out her dog called fenna he stood on his back legs and he put his paws on my shoulders
YOU1000000035_S0000187	i was deeply moved by sheila is stories and found out information i did not previously know such as there being varying types of kangle
YOU1000000035_S0000197	sheila also nicely cleared up the kangle versus anatolian shepherd debate and explained why these 2 dog breeds are certainly not the same
YOU1000000035_S0000206	if you would like to find out more about kangles you can contact carl via his web page
YOU1000000038_S0000001	thank you for joining us i am spencer tillis
YOU1000000038_S0000002	and i am giselle espinals
YOU1000000038_S0000012	and i would not be surprised if ravens had coach john harbaugh had his own fancy football draft regular season is right around the corner we will let you know our picks
YOU1000000038_S0000021	you know the lions are one of the teams that every other team in the basketball north division actually circles on their calendar so they mean business
YOU1000000038_S0000026	and what i really was impressed with was bradley how calm and composed he was throughout that interview and throughout the game
YOU1000000038_S0000043	and the fact is i mean steven decatur that is they had guys that they were handing the ball off to running hard downhill and they also had a guy that was about £250 and he was laying guys out i mean he was picking up yards you want to talk about falling forward to get the 1st down
YOU1000000038_S0000044	he was definitely getting that done out there from jessica and i feel like moving forward they got a good thing going there it is always nice when you have a couple guys you can hand the ball to
YOU1000000038_S0000047	and as coach knox said the cream usually comes to the top
YOU1000000038_S0000049	and seaford they hosted a 4 team scrimmage game which included park side james and bennett and curtis richardson now a strong play for bold teams in this thing
YOU1000000038_S0000050	and speaking of strong play check out this run here by t j hayward i mean just knocking guys out of his way barring downhill chris richardson was moving the ball as well in this thing their corporate back skews here in the middle up the crease and
YOU1000000038_S0000051	making a lot of guys miss he is going to be a guy to watch here parked in the other hand they were getting it done through the air air and this one out way downhill devin redding sleeping that beautiful catch there for completion
YOU1000000038_S0000055	you know spencer actually being out there on saturday felt like each team was actually playing for a championship one team that stood out from the rest of them were the rams and i mean their running game was on point finding the holes evading defenders they could do no wrong in my eyes
YOU1000000038_S0000056	on the other hand one of the teams that made some mistakes on both sides of the ball was the blue jays i spoke to coach darling and he said his team is too selfish right now and is trying to get them to be a more cohesive unit and you know the scrimmage is actually going to help them get to that better direction
YOU1000000038_S0000057	and it is always tough to do that is his 1st year at the program so moving forward you kind of need to get that senior leadership and kind of stability yourself so i am sure will be fine down the stretch but early on that is always tough to go but a thing that really impressed me was park side i mean they had some guys down the field that were definitely making some plays at the ball
YOU1000000038_S0000063	hayden i am mat griffith from easton high school varsity football coach you are watching the dell marva sports insider
YOU1000000038_S0000066	our own trail miles had a chance to talk to his old coach about the programs direction trail were you tempted to put on some gear and do you miss it
YOU1000000038_S0000069	so i stopped my practice and chatted with my former jv coach now varsity head coach pat mcglinchey to see exactly what waiver will need to improve upon to return to the basic dominance
YOU1000000038_S0000076	my man nelson brown will be featured in this office talk about him and why he excells at what he does
YOU1000000038_S0000077	nelson brown is just one of those phenomenal athletes he is not an athlete you that comes around all the time you know nelson is being looked at by division one double a football schools
YOU1000000038_S0000078	he is a scholarship kid and we are waiting on that 1st scholarship morgan states been really looking hard at him but you know beside that he is just he goes out there and he is the alternative competitor
YOU1000000038_S0000081	i would say the the new comer that i am looking forward to the most is rakwon mccarter he is just at every single thing that we could offer he he goes to the off season training the waitroom the beach
YOU1000000038_S0000083	you have got a new guy here at corner keandre custon who when we saw him at the ben tate camp honestly in my eyes he was the best corner there talk about him and what this young defense will bring to the table
YOU1000000038_S0000084	yeah our our debacs this year are are pretty much all new like you said keanna is one of those guys he is going to try to shut you down a line of scrimmage
YOU1000000038_S0000088	there is that man nelson brown he was out to on saturday with a shower broose just precautionary he told me he expects to practice on monday there is another star shain leatherbury and he is a veteran and natural born leader of the wildcats i expect those young guys there to look up for him
YOU1000000038_S0000092	gets the pick right there he is out on the island by himself and this guy will be a natural born leader one thing i really liked about wahi was their defensive line
YOU1000000038_S0000093	i am telling you him and mell morris are 2 defense studs on the defensive line this play right here by this young man raquan mccarter is just a fabulous play look at him take it down through the middle and get those defenders out of his way that is just a felty move excuse me thank you for a touchdown
YOU1000000038_S0000094	this kid is going to be a stud not to be out done del mar junior diaz brown takes the hand off straight up the middle 60 yards out and he did not even get touched folks he has got some burners he had a great scrimmage as well
YOU1000000038_S0000095	and for del mar coach dave herrn he knows that the pre season is all about figuring in his team out
YOU1000000038_S0000102	name is david wells inside the linebacker for james and bennett and you are watching dmo or sports inside
YOU1000000038_S0000105	head coach wheatley is team will be trying to make it to the state tournament after coming up was just one game short a year ago finishing with a 9 and 6 record that right there was sara davis putting on the moves from way outside and scoring it just a beautiful goal
YOU1000000038_S0000106	and then just a few minutes later the raiders they were right back at it they found the net one more time this one was from brady keeler with the honors with a beautiful slap shot
YOU1000000038_S0000110	definitely when you raise it up there and the fact is i looked at this team and i we went in and i was talking with coach wooliver and they had they knew they were going to be able to score the ball and they knew they had a good opportunity of being a very high scoring team but they did not realize how good they were going to be defensibly and they definitely showed that in this scrimmage
YOU1000000038_S0000114	yeah absolutely and by the way congratulations coach or coach weatley she actually just got married a couple of weeks ago
YOU1000000038_S0000119	we have got 15 girls out here we kind of tried to go with our most athletic girls and just kind of work with it from there but they are very excited coach jackson and i are very excited so it is always cool to have a new program give the kids more experiences
YOU1000000038_S0000124	and spencer one of the things that they have to also see is being able to build that roster and see who is actually going to be able to perform well on the court
YOU1000000038_S0000129	this is monica wheatley for the wood bridge field hacky team and you are watching the dell marva sports and sides
YOU1000000038_S0000132	my sleeper pic is actually someone i went to high school with t y hilton from the cults of white receiver and he was as impressive with andrew luck he was impressive as andrew luck number one option last season after the injury to pro caine red wayne
YOU1000000038_S0000133	i mean just look as those stats from last season hilton had 1083 yards and 5 touchdown he is speedy and sure wayne is coming back this season but i think hilton will put up big numbers this season
YOU1000000038_S0000135	yeah well my sleeper i did not go to high school with but i am going with ej manuel manuel missed 6 games last season with an hyper extended nee but he has got some serious weapons now cj spiller fred jack jackson
YOU1000000038_S0000136	they traded up in the draft for sammy watkins he is a monster they add robert woods and speester markis goodwin and they both got mike williams on and mean there is a lot of weapons there a lot of young weapons but they are very talented he is undrafted in most leagues you know
YOU1000000038_S0000138	i think there is a big reason why he is undrafted mostly i am sleeping on manuel web forward
YOU1000000038_S0000139	but the guy i am going with i mean tides are always hard to find and i think ladarius screen is going to have a big year for the chargers in this
YOU1000000038_S0000140	i mean he did not exactly have amazing numbers last year i get it just 13 catches and 3 tds but he is starting to take more and more reps with the ones philip rivers loves his tidings and i think he is going to get a lot of balls thrown his way this year
YOU1000000038_S0000147	drum roll i got gronk i know someone out there also has rob gronkowski as their buzz i know 0 of an ac injury and he is no adrian prescott let us be real the unlucky number here is 14 and know that is not the number of touchdown
YOU1000000038_S0000149	he is also had 8 career surgeries i just do not see the spark in gronkowski how much can he really physically overcome this season the game is just getting even harder
YOU1000000038_S0000150	i do not know how many times you got bradey i feel like you are going to be all right
YOU1000000038_S0000152	all right sorry not sorry eagles fans but i am going with nick foles yeah i know what you are saying and nick is had amazing numbers last season which is exactly where i am standing away from him teams now have film on them and they are prepared for chip kelly is offense
YOU1000000038_S0000153	plus he lost the shawn jackson he looked lost when i was up there at eagles camp guys but so did all the other eagles cornerbacks but i am not saying i do not draft the eagle especially the shawn mccoy
YOU1000000038_S0000154	but i do not think michael foles is going to put up half the numbers he put up last year
YOU1000000038_S0000157	i definitely going to stay away from though is eric decker i mean this guy is definitely going to cost some people from winning their legs because they are going to draw them i get it i mean he had some good numbers in denver but the fact is that offense is ridiculous there
YOU1000000038_S0000160	next week when we bring in chris russell from esbn 980 in dc talk about the red skins and coming up after the break one of our favorite segments crazy catches dives and stops our plays of the week coming up you will not want to miss it
YOU1000000038_S0000161	my name is truston harris courtney back at dover high and you are watching dan moore is sports and shoot
YOU1000000038_S0000170	we take it over to some clippers and kernel action it is only a scrimmage but why do they look like mid season form senior corporal back jake lamore under pressure still able to find that receiver
YOU1000000038_S0000171	i mean with a defender on him makes the incredible catch he was in the air
YOU1000000038_S0000173	and my play with of the day will come from the scrimmage i was at way high software running back ray carter gets a sweep off the right side

YOU1000000040_S0000039	and pour it all over the meat and you can actually see the tomato source that sheina mentioned as well so you can see the slight orange color in there and then look at the butter just glicking on that meat so
YOU1000000040_S0000094	0 yeah that is really good so it is very strong quite bitter and i do not know if thomas mentioned but drinking tea is like a national pastime and turkey people stop and have a couple of tea like all throughout the day right from the early morning right through
YOU1000000040_S0000101	all of the flavor just builds you know when it is natural mint flavor because it comes on slowly and like sheena said we have had this turchio delight before and i know that this mint flavor just
