POD1000000016_S0000183	AFTER EVERYTHING THAT BLACK AMERICANS HAVE BEEN THROUGH IN THIS COUNTRY THAT THEY DIDN'T IMMEDIATELY TAKE UP LINCOLN'S OFFER AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE AND START OVER IS REALLY AN ASTOUNDING TESTIMONY TO THEIR BELIEF IN THE AMERICAN IDEALS

POD1000000019_S0000115	THEN ONE DAY IN BLACK MAN'S APARTMENT GENIE'S LAYING NAKED ON THE COUCH AFTER HAVING SEX WITH HIM WHEN SHE'S SUDDENLY BLINDED BY FLASHES OF BRIGHT LIGHT THERE'S BLACK MAN HOLDING A CAMERA WITH A STROBE FLASH ATTACHMENT
POD1000000019_S0000126	HE HIRES GENIE AS A SECRETARY WHICH IS WHERE SHE'S WORKING WHEN A SONG WRITER FRIEND ASKED HER TO SING ON THE DEMO OF HIS NEW SONG HE WANTS SHELBY SINGLETON AT PLANTATION RECORDS TO HEAR
POD1000000019_S0000127	I COULDN'T FIND A RECORDING OF GENIE SINGING IT BUT I FOUND THE SONGWRITER SINGING IT HIMSELF SO YOU CAN TRY TO IMAGINE WHAT GENIE WOULD HAVE SOUNDED LIKE ON THE DEMO

POD1000000019_S0000141	SHELBY TELLS GENIE THEY'LL USE HER MIDDLE INITIAL TO MAKE HER STAND OUT MORE FROM THE OTHER GENIES AND ADD AN EYE TO HER FIRST NAME SO PEOPLE KNOW IT'S NOT PRONOUNCED GENE
POD1000000019_S0000142	FINDING OUT SHE REALLY DOESN'T HAVE TO BE RONDA RENAE PLUS THE FACT THAT EVERYONE IN THE ROOM SEEMS CERTAIN SHE JUST CUT A MASSIVE HIT SONG IMPROVES GENIE'S MOOD
POD1000000019_S0000151	WHEN SHE FINDS OUT SHE'S THE ONE PAYING FOR ALL OF THAT GENIE AND MICKEY DON'T NEED HELP SPENDING THE MONEY THEY'RE THROWING DOWN MAJOR CASH ON CLOTHING JEWELRY HAIRSTYLES CARS ALL THE USUAL ROCK STAR STUFF
POD1000000019_S0000155	ANYWAY PRETTY SOON GENIE STARTS SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME WITH HER MANAGER PAUL PERRY ONE NIGHT THEY'RE SITTING AROUND HOLDING HANDS AND PERRY'S TALKING ABOUT HOW CAREFUL GENIE HAS TO BE NOW THAT SHE'S ON TOP
POD1000000019_S0000159	MADE FROM HER OLD SESSIONS WITH HIM NOW THAT GENIE'S GOT THE BIGGEST HIT IN THE NATION THESE RECORDS WILL SELL
POD1000000019_S0000161	BLACK MAN'S GOT A MANILA ENVELOPE LIKE YOU SEE IN EVERY MOVIE ABOUT A PRIVATE DETECTIVE AND HE WANTS TO GIVE IT TO GENIE BUT FIRST SHE'S GOT TO SIGN A NEW PIECE OF PAPER SAYING SHE WON'T SUE HIM FOR RELEASING HER OLD RECORDINGS
POD1000000019_S0000170	WHICH IS ALSO THE EXPLANATION FOR WHY GENIE WOULD BE IN LAS VEGAS OPENING UP FOR JOHNNY PAYCHECK WHEN ALL SHE'S SUPPOSEDLY DONE IS ONE BARELY RELEASED SINGLE FOR BLACK ROSE RECORDS
POD1000000019_S0000184	SOMETHING PHYSICAL FOR GENIE NEED TO PLAY PRETEND WITH TO KEEP THE WHOLE CHARADE GOING IT WAS CALLED YOU WRITE THE MUSIC CREDITED TO GENE RILEY QUOTE UNQUOTE RELEASED ON LITTLE DARLING RECORDS IN
POD1000000019_S0000188	NOW HERE ARE THE TWO BIG QUESTIONS I DON'T THINK I CAN OR SHOULD EVEN TRY TO ANSWER DID AUBREY MAYHEW AND GENIE C RILEY HAVE AN AFFAIR
POD1000000019_S0000201	SHE GETS TO PICK WILD MOUNTAIN BERRIES WITH GLENN CAMPBELL ON TV
POD1000000019_S0000208	IF YOU'RE STARTING TO GET THE IDEA THAT GENIE'S ALWAYS THOUGHT OF AS LITTLE MORE THAN A PUPPET FOR THE PEOPLE BEHIND THE SCENES OF HER CAREER I WOULD SAY THAT SEEMS ACCURATE
POD1000000019_S0000213	AND WHILE THE SONG IS ACTUALLY SUNG BY THE DAUGHTER CHARACTER WHO DOESN'T DRESS THAT WAY EVERY TIME YOU SEE GENIE C RILEY SHE LOOKS LIKE MRS JOHNSON
POD1000000019_S0000228	FROM THE NIGHTMARE SHE DESCRIBES YOU'D EXPECT THAT TO BE THE ONLY TIME SHE EVER TOKED UP BUT THIS VIDEO CLIP OF RALPH EMERY INTERVIEWING HER SEEMS TO SUGGEST OTHERWISE
POD1000000019_S0000234	THE ONLY OTHER WOMAN TO DO THAT IN THE NINETEEN HUNDREDS IS DOLLY PARTON WITH NINE TO FIVE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE MAKING GENIE THE FIRST WOMAN TO EVER DO IT IF YOU DON'T COUNT THE FARCE WITH LITTLE DARLING RECORDS
POD1000000019_S0000252	HERE'S HER DOING IT ON THE JOHNNY CASH SHOW
POD1000000019_S0000261	LIKE THE ELY TIMES POP CRITIC ROBERT HILBURN WHO REVIEWED A GENIE C RILEY CONCERT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE UNDER THE HEADLINE LITTLE TALENT
POD1000000019_S0000268	SHE ALWAYS HAD A CRACK BAND BEHIND HER THE HARPER VALLEY EXPRESS THEY USUALLY MADE THE TEMPO OF EVERYTHING FASTER TO REALLY PUT SOME GAS IN THE TANK AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO DENY GENIE'S CHARISMA AS A PERFORMER
POD1000000019_S0000274	NOT ONLY WAS GENIE NOT A ONE HIT WONDER SHE MADE GOOD ALBUMS WITH VERY LITTLE FILLER CHECK OUT THIS ALBUM TRACK FROM NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO NEVER EVEN RELEASED AS A SINGLE CALLED WITHOUT YOU
POD1000000019_S0000277	WITHOUT YOU IS FROM GENIE'S SECOND ALBUM ON MGM AFTER LEAVING PLANTATION RECORDS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO IN WHAT SHELBY SINGLETON CALLED A BREACH OF CONTRACT
POD1000000019_S0000291	AKA THE EXACT OPPOSITE AUDIENCE OF THE ONLY REASON ANYONE KNOWS GENIE C RILEY'S NAME HARPER VALLEY P T A A SONG HIGHLY CRITICAL OF HYPOCRISY IN SOCIAL GROUPS WITH HARDCORE CONSERVATIVE VALUES
POD1000000019_S0000301	NEXT MOVE ASK TOM T HALL TO WRITE ANOTHER HARPER VALLEY PTA A THING HE'D BEEN VERY VOCAL ABOUT HIS RELUCTANCE TO DO BUT ALSO HE'S A BIG SOFTIE
POD1000000019_S0000355	AND THAT DISCLAIMER IS WRITTEN BY GENIE'S CO AUTHOR WHO I ALSO FAIL TO MENTION IS A PREACHER HERE'S WHAT HE WRITES QUOTE TO KEEP FROM HURTING SOME OF THE FOLKS GENIE LOVES WE HAVE CHANGED THE NAMES OF SEVERAL PEOPLE IN THE BOOK
POD1000000019_S0000374	ONE THING THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING THAT WE HEARD TODAY IS UNLIKE AS YOU HEARD IN THE SECOND EPISODE OF THE PODCAST LARETTA LYNN'S RECORDING OF THE PILL
POD1000000019_S0000378	I THINK MONEY TALKS I THINK THAT BY THE TIME ANY OF THOSE WOULD BE BUZZ KILLS STARTED PAYING ATTENTION THIS SONG WAS ALREADY THE NUMBER ONE POP SONG IN AMERICA AND IT WENT NUMBER ONE COUNTRY
POD1000000019_S0000379	EVERY MAJOR RECORD LABEL IN NASHVILLE HAD BEEN FALLING ALL OVER ITSELF FOR FIFTEEN YEARS TRYING TO DO THAT THEY'D HAVE MADE GENE C RILEY THE MAYOR OF NASHVILLE IF SHE DID IT A SECOND TIME
POD1000000019_S0000387	THEN TWO YEARS LATER IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE AS GENIE STATED IN THE BOOK THIS IS REALLY AGGRAVATING FOR ME TO HAVE TO TALK ABOUT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THIS IS JUST MY FAULT
POD1000000021_S0000006	THAT'S TRINA EDWARDS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HER HUSBAND EDWIN EDWARDS THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF LOUISIANA
POD1000000021_S0000018	EDWARD SERVED EIGHT YEARS ON CORRUPTION CHARGES
POD1000000021_S0000042	THERE WERE SIX GRAND JURY INVESTIGATIONS DURING EDWARDS'S FIRST TERM
POD1000000021_S0000046	EDWARDS LED LOUISIANA FOR EIGHT YEARS LEAVING OFFICE IN MARCH NINETEEN EIGHTY
POD1000000021_S0000047	THE ONLY THING STOPPING HIM FROM BEING GOVERNOR FOR LIFE WERE TERM LIMITS THAT EDWARDS HIMSELF HAD PUSHED FOR
POD1000000021_S0000058	EDWARDS WAS RIGHT TO BELIEVE THAT NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE ELECTION WAS A LOCK HE'D WIN IT WITH SIXTY TWO PERCENT OF THE VOTE
POD1000000021_S0000061	IF THERE'S ONE THING LOUISIANA GOVERNOR ELECT EDWIN EDWARDS KNOWS IT'S HOW TO HAVE A GOOD TIME EVEN WITH A FOUR MILLION DOLLAR CAMPAIGN DEFICIT STARRING HIM DOWN
POD1000000021_S0000062	EDWARDS CHARTERED TWO JUMBO JETS ANNOUNCED HE WAS GOING TO PARIS AND INVITED ANYONE WILLING TO CONTRIBUTE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO COME ON ALONG
POD1000000021_S0000096	WHEN I ASKED EDWARDS ABOUT THE CASE HE DIDN'T SOUND ALL THAT SORRY
POD1000000021_S0000111	BUDDY ROGER WAS A CONGRESSMAN FROM NORTH LOUISIANA
POD1000000021_S0000121	THERE WOULD BE NO RUNOFF ROMER WOULD BE THE NEXT GOVERNOR OF LOUISIANA
POD1000000021_S0000123	BUT THAT'S NOT HOW EDWARD SAW IT DROPPING OUT OF THE RACE THAT WAS THE FIRST STEP IN HIS COMEBACK PLAN
POD1000000021_S0000133	IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE DAVID DUKE WAS AT THE HEIGHT OF HIS POWERS
POD1000000021_S0000137	THIS IS SLOW BURN I'M JOSH LEVINE EPISODE FIVE THE ROAD TO HELL
POD1000000021_S0000140	THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S SIMPLY SAFE HAS SPENT A DECADE FIGHTING AGAINST
POD1000000021_S0000148	SIMPLY SAFE WAS NAMED BEST OVERALL HOME SECURITY OF TWENTY TWENTY BY US NEWS AND WORLD REPORT
POD1000000021_S0000153	IT WAS NINETEEN THIRTY AND THE GOVERNOR WAS HUEY LONG
POD1000000021_S0000157	LONG WAS SHOT AND KILLED AT THE STATE CAPITOL FIVE YEARS LATER
POD1000000021_S0000159	YES LONG WAS A CORRUPT DICTATOR AND SURE HE ORCHESTRATED A KIDNAPPING
POD1000000021_S0000161	EDWIN EDWARDS CARRIED ON HUEY LONG'S TRADITION OF ECONOMIC POPULISM
POD1000000021_S0000162	LIKE LONG EDWARDS USE MONEY SNATCH FROM BIG OIL TO BUILD BRIDGES AND HOSPITALS
POD1000000021_S0000167	IN REALITY DUKE'S BRAND OF POPULISM HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH SHRINKING GOVERNMENT
POD1000000021_S0000169	DUKE'S MESSAGE THE JOURNALIST JOHN MCGINNIS WROTE HELPED A LOT OF APPEAL FOR THE CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN OF HUEY LONG'S OLD VOTERS
POD1000000021_S0000172	THEY WANT TO SEE WHERE YOU ARE LONG WAS SHOT AND WHERE DAVID DUKE SITS
POD1000000021_S0000181	ROGER'S BIG INITIATIVE WAS A PLAN TO MODERNIZE THE STATE'S APPROACH TO TAXATION
POD1000000021_S0000184	ROMER WAS ADAMANT THAT HIS FISCAL REFORM PLAN WAS NOT A TAX INCREASE
POD1000000021_S0000187	DAVID DUKE THEN A NEWLY ELECTED STATE LEGISLATOR WAS ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S MOST OUTSPOKEN CRITICS
POD1000000021_S0000197	DIGGING LOUISIANA IS ALREADY TROUBLED ECONOMY EVER DEEPER IN DEBT AND FORCING REFORM MINDED GOVERNOR BUDDY ROGER TO SCRABBLE HIS WAY OUT OF A NEW FINANCIAL CRISIS
POD1000000021_S0000206	BUT STRATHER WHO'D HELPED ROMER WIN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WAS AVAILABLE TO WORK ON THE GOVERNOR'S RE ELECTION CAMPAIGN
POD1000000021_S0000219	ROMER ACTUALLY LIKED THE RUBBER BAND IDEA
POD1000000021_S0000225	IN HIS STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS ROMER APOLOGIZED TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR HIS INFLEXIBILITY AND INSENSITIVITY
POD1000000021_S0000228	FOR STRATHER THE SELF HELP STUFF WAS BAD BUT WHAT HAPPENED NEXT WAS WORSE
POD1000000021_S0000231	I SAW MARY MATTLEN A WHOLE BUNCH OF HIGH ECHELON REPUBLICANS SITTING AROUND THE TABLE WITH BY THE DINING ROOM TABLE WITH BUDDY
POD1000000021_S0000242	IDEOLOGY ASIDE ROMER THOUGHT THE MOVE WAS SMART STRATEGY
POD1000000021_S0000243	EDWIN EDWARDS WAS GOING TO GRAB VOTES FROM HIS LEFT NO MATTER WHAT
POD1000000021_S0000244	ROMER FIGURED THAT BRANDING HIMSELF A REPUBLICAN WOULD HELP STAVE OFF RIGHT WING CHALLENGES WHO MIGHT THREATEN HIS REELECTION
POD1000000021_S0000245	THE STATEWIDE POLL SHOWED THAT THE TOP THREE CANDIDATES ARE DUKE EDWARDS AND MYSELF
POD1000000021_S0000250	DEMOCRATS IN LOUISIANA FELT BURNED BY ROMER AND REPUBLICANS INCLUDING STATE PARTY OFFICIALS WEREN'T SURE THEY COULD TRUST HIM EITHER
POD1000000021_S0000252	RESENTED THAT ROGER HADN'T INCLUDED HIM IN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE PARTY SWITCH AND ROGER FORGETTING THE LESSONS OF ALL I EVER NEEDED TO KNOW I LEARNED IN KINDERGARTEN CURSED OUT AND UNGUESSED RATHER THAN TRYING TO APPEASE HIM
POD1000000021_S0000254	THAT ENCOURAGEMENT WOULDN'T GO TO BUDDY ROGER OR DAVID DUKE
POD1000000021_S0000260	THEN DUKE WAS AGGING THEM ON YOU KNOW TO DISRUPT THINGS
POD1000000021_S0000263	BUDDY ROGER HAD TRIED TO CONSOLIDATE THE CONSERVATIVE VOTE
POD1000000021_S0000296	BY NINETEEN NINETY ONE THE OPEN PRIMARY WAS OPEN IN A WAY EDWARDS MAYBE HADN'T ANTICIPATED
POD1000000021_S0000305	DUKE COULD PASS THE BUCKET WITH IMPUNITY DURING HIS NINETEEN NINETY SENATE CAMPAIGN BECAUSE THAT WAS A FEDERAL RACE
POD1000000021_S0000307	HAMSTRUNG BY THESE NEW RULES DUKE HELD FEWER RALLIES AS A CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR THAN WHEN HE RAN FOR THE SENATE AND EDWARDS'S FUNDRAISING SLOWED TO A TRICKLE
POD1000000021_S0000312	RAYMOND STROTHER SAW IT UP CLOSE DURING THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN RACE
POD1000000021_S0000326	THE PROBLEM FOR ROGER WAS THAT A LOT OF SWING VOTERS FELT DRAWN TO ANOTHER CANDIDATE
POD1000000021_S0000343	IT WASN'T CLEAR BASED ON POLLING HOW WHITE PEOPLE IN LOUISIANA WERE RESPONDING TO DUKE'S LATEST ATTEMPT AT IMAGE MANAGEMENT
POD1000000021_S0000344	SUSAN HOWLL HAD BEEN STRUGGLING FOR YEARS TO GET A HANDLE ON DUKE'S VOTERS

YOU1000000007_S0000027	HEY JASON I'M HERE TO ASSIST YOU WITH GETTING THE MOST ACCURATE VALUE OF YOUR HOME A COUPLE OF QUICK QUESTIONS ARE YOU A REALTOR OR ARE YOU WORKING WITH A REALTOR AND SO NOW WHAT WE DO IS WE JUST HIT NEXT
YOU1000000019_S0000002	THE CUBE WAS DESIGNED BY CHI MO FANGI AND WAS APPROVED BY MAT'S VALK OF COURSE THE CUBE IS HIS MAIN BUT LET'S SEE HOW THE CUBE ACTUALLY PERFORMS AND WHETHER IT'S RIGHT FOR YOU
YOU1000000021_S0000004	THE D N W IS A CONTINUOUSLY SPINNING SLOT MACHINE SYSTEM THAT CONFIRMS VARIOUS BONUSES EFFECTS AND ATTACKS BASED ON THE RESULTS INCLUDING HOW ZACK LEVELS UP
YOU1000000021_S0000007	THE GAME BEGINS WITH ZACK FAIR SOLDIER SECOND CLASS OF THE GROUP CALLED SOLDIER A PRIVATE MILITARY ARMY OWNED BY THE SENIOR ELECTRIC POWER COMPANY IN THE CITY OF MIDGAR
YOU1000000021_S0000009	ZACK HAS TREMENDOUS SKILLS AND TALENT BUT IS UNFORTUNATELY A LITTLE OVERCONFIDENT AND RECKLESS AT TIMES AS POINTED OUT BY HIS FELLOW SOLDIER ANOTHER FIRST CLASS NAME SEPHORA
YOU1000000021_S0000011	AND GIEL HELPS HIM OUT REMINDING HIM TO TEMPER HIS ASPIRATIONS WITH PASSIONATE DREAMS AND STEADFAST HONOR
YOU1000000021_S0000012	ZACK HEARS FROM A FELLOW SOLDIER OF THE MASS DESERTION OF TROOPS IN SOLDIER AND HE'S SOON CALLED IN TO SPEAK WITH THE DIRECTOR OF SOLDIER A MAN LYING IN
YOU1000000021_S0000019	SUDDENLY ANGEL GOES MISSING AND SEPHORTH SUSPECTS HE TOO HAS BETRAYED THEM AND DESERTED THOUGH ZACK FERVENTLY DENIES IT
YOU1000000021_S0000020	AFTER THE MISSION DIRECTOR LAZARUS CONFIRMS ANGELO REALLY IS GONE FOR UNKNOWN REASONS BUT ASSIGNED ZACK ON A NEW MISSION
YOU1000000021_S0000027	FINDING ANGEL'S MOTHER JILIAN SHE NOTES ZACK IS THE RESTLESS PUPPY ANGELA OFTEN SPOKE ABOUT AND SHE TELLS HIM GENESIS CAME BY A MONTH AGO WITH AN ARMY OF MINIONS AND PROCEEDED TO START KILLING TOWNSHIP
YOU1000000021_S0000045	AS SEPHIROTH TALKS MORE ZACK HE ELABORATES MORE HOW ANGEL GENESIS AND HIMSELF WERE CLOSE FRIENDS AND EVEN THOUGH SEPHIROTH HIMSELF WAS THE COMPANY'S PRIZED WAR HERO GENESIS WHOSESELF WANTED SUCH PRIZE AS WELL
YOU1000000021_S0000048	SURVEYING THE MONSTER SAPPHIRE REDUCES THE DO OR IN LEAGUE WITH DR HOLYLANDER WHICH TIES INTO THE STORY YOU JUST TOLD
YOU1000000021_S0000054	HOLLANDER HIMSELF APPEARS SURPRISED TO SEE THEM BUT EXPLAINS ONLY HE CAN STOP GENESIS'S DEGRADATION AFTER WHICH GENESIS HIMSELF APPEARS AND EXPLAINS HOLLANDER WON'T BE CAPTURED
YOU1000000021_S0000063	SHE'S NATURALLY SURPRISED AND ACTUALLY LIKES HIS UNIQUE EYES TO WHICH ZACK CONTINUES TO FLIRT SHOWING OFF THE TRADEMARK MACA ENVIED EYES OF A SOLDIER
YOU1000000021_S0000069	LATER ZACK GOES TO VISIT AERITH WHEN SONG HALTS HIM TO CALL HIM INTO A MISSION TO MODELOHEM AND GIVE ZACK PAUSE WHEN HE SAYS HE ALSO KNOWS AERITH WHAT WON'T ELABORATE
YOU1000000021_S0000072	ZACK IS FROM THE TINY VILLAGE OF GONGA GAGA AND THIS VILLAGE IS FROM NEVELHEIM WHO INTRODUCES HIMSELF AS CLOUD
YOU1000000021_S0000073	AS THE MISSION FOR HOLLANDER CONTINUES GENESIS MOVES TO KILL HIM AS HE'S ALREADY BEGIN VISIBLY DEGRADED AND CLAIMS HE DOESN'T NEED HOLLANDER ANYMORE
YOU1000000021_S0000076	ON HIS WAY OUT HE IS MET BY ANGEL AS WELL AS HOLLANDER WHO EXPLAINS THE G AND PROJECT G WAS NOT FOR GENESIS BUT FOR JILIAN WHO WAS ANGEL'S MOTHER WHO APPARENTLY TOOK HER OWN LIFE EARLIER THAN NORA
YOU1000000021_S0000077	THE EXPERIMENT WAS TWOFOLD JILIAN HAD JENOVA CELLS INJECTED INTO HER WHILE SHE WAS PREGNANT WITH ANGEL AND GENESIS SIMPLY HAD JENOVA CELLS IMPLANTED DIRECTLY INTO HIM AS A TEST TUBE BABY
YOU1000000021_S0000079	REASON BEING ANGEL CAN USE THE GENOME CELLS AS A TWO WAY CONDUIT AS INTENDED ANGEL THEN EXPLAINS HIS CELLS CAN ABSORB GENETIC TRAITS AND PASS IT TO OTHERS BEYOND WHAT GENESIS CAN MANAGE WHICH IS ONLY IMPRINT THEM ONTO OTHERS
YOU1000000021_S0000082	AFTER WINNING A BITTER VICTORY A DEGRADING ANGEL IS GRATEFUL THAT ZACK ENDED HIM WITH DIGNITY AND HONOR BEFORE DYING HE PASSES ON HIS FAMILY SWORD AND LEGACY OF HONOR THE BUSTER SWORD TO ZACK
YOU1000000021_S0000088	SHE TEASES HIM ABOUT HIS GIRLFRIEND AARON AND EXPLAINS SHE'S UNDER CONSTANT TURK SURVEILLANCE AS IT TURNS OUT SHE IS THE LAST LIVING MEMBER OF A RACE CALLED THE ANCIENT
YOU1000000021_S0000089	ZACK IS SURPRISED NOT ONLY TO LEARN THIS BUT ALSO THAT AERITH NEVER TOLD HIM
YOU1000000021_S0000092	AND SO ZACK'S VACATION IS OVER AS THE THREE OF THEM ARE TO INVESTIGATE ATTACK ON JUNON
YOU1000000021_S0000093	IT TURNS OUT MORE GENESIS CLONES WERE ATTACKING AND THIS TIME HOLLANDER WAS EVEN THERE THOUGH HE GETS AWAY ONCE AGAIN
YOU1000000021_S0000095	RETURNING TO AERITH HE FINDS A MONSTER DOG THERE BUT IT'S NOT REALLY CAUSING PROBLEMS THOUGH ZACK NOTES IT'S ALSO AN ANIMAL COPY AND IT SEEMS KEEN TO PROTECT AERITH
YOU1000000021_S0000101	AS THEIR MISSION AND MENTIONS NOTHING OF THEIR OLD FRIENDS SAPEROTH PRIVATELY CONFIRMS THIS TO ZACK THAT HE'S SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING LEAVING SHERRY AS WELL DEPENDING ON WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS MISSION
YOU1000000021_S0000105	AS THEY ARRIVE SEPHIROTH MAKES SMALL TALK ASKING CLAUDE HOW IT FEELS TO BE HOME AGAIN AND TRYING TO RELATE AS HE HAS NO ORIGINAL TOWN AND ALL HE KNOWS IS HIS MOTHER'S NAME TO BE GENOVA WHO DIED AFTER HE WAS BORN
YOU1000000021_S0000106	IN TOWN THEY ARE MET BY A LOCAL TOWN GIRL BY THE NAME OF TIFA
YOU1000000021_S0000107	WHEN TIVA LEARNS A SOLDIER FIRST CLASS SHE SEEMS SURPRISED BY THE FACT THAT THEY ONLY SET HIM IN SEPHIRA AND BEGINS TO ASK SOMETHING ELSE BUT STOPS AND RUNS OFF INSTEAD
YOU1000000021_S0000117	SEPHIROTH COMES A HORRIFYING HYPOTHESIS THAT IT'S POSSIBLE HE WAS CREATED THE SAME WAY AND IT BECOMES A CRISIS OF IDENTITY IRONICALLY IDENTICAL TO HIS FRIENDS GENESIS AND ANGEL
YOU1000000021_S0000128	AFTERWARDS CLOUD WISHES HE WERE STRONG LIKE ZACK BUT ZACK WARNS HIM NOT TO GET TANGLED UP WITH SOLDIER
YOU1000000021_S0000132	IS SUDDENLY ON FIRE WITH MANY TOWN SPEAKERS SLAIN EVEN CLOUD IS BEATEN ONCE AGAIN AND AROUND THE CORNER AS CEPHALOTH HIMSELF CALMLY STANDING AMIDST THE FLAMES
YOU1000000021_S0000135	CONFRONTING SEPHIROTH ZAK IS IGNORED AS SEPHIROTH INSISTS HIS MOTHER THE ANCIENT WAS THE SUPERIOR RACE AND THEY SHOULD HAVE RULED THE PLANET
YOU1000000021_S0000137	FINALLY FED UP WITH THE CRIMES OF HUMANS AND SHEILA IN PARTICULAR SEPHIROTH SEIZES WHAT ANGEL AND GENESIS KEPT WARNING ABOUT AND CHOOSES TO STAND ALONE
YOU1000000021_S0000152	CLOUD SUCCUMBS TO HIS INJURIES NEXT TO ZACK AND AS THEY BOTH PASS OUT DR HOJO ARRIVES ON THE SCENE AND CHOOSES CLOUD TO BE HIS NEXT TEST SUBJECT
YOU1000000021_S0000156	HOWEVER SINNER LABELS IN BOTH FUGITIVE SAMPLES SO THEY FIND THEMSELVES NOW RUNNING FROM THE ARMY AND SICINY ACTUALLY MANAGES TO CATCH UP TO THEM FIRST
YOU1000000021_S0000157	HE PLEADS WITH HER TO JUST WALK AWAY AS HE KNOWS IT'S TOUGH ORDER TO ESCAPE THE TURKS BUT SIDONA CHOOSES HER DUTY OVER A PERSONAL FEELINGS
YOU1000000021_S0000161	HE KNOWS THAT ARE HOJO'S LATEST EXPERIMENTS AND MODIFIED VERSIONS OF GENOVA'S POWER RUNS THROUGH BOTH OF THEM
YOU1000000021_S0000171	ZACK STOPS TO FINALLY CONFRONT THE FAILED AND TORCHED CREATION OF A GENOVA INFUSED HUMAN WHO CONSIDERS ZACK A PERFECT FUSION OF ANGEL'S WILL AND CEPHALOPHORUS SUPERIOR CELLS
YOU1000000021_S0000185	MEANWHILE SONG ORDERS CYNTHIA AND THE OTHER TURKS TO FIND AND SAVE SACK BEFORE THE ARMY FINDS THEM WHICH CYNTHIA IS VERY MOTIVATED TO DO
YOU1000000021_S0000186	THOUGH THIS IS THE NEAR TREES IN HIS ACTION SONG IS WILLING TO RISK IT FOR HIS FRIEND AND FOR EITHER SIDE
YOU1000000021_S0000188	UNFORTUNATELY THE ARMY INTERCEPTS ZACK FIRST AND ZACK WILLINGLY CHOOSES THE FIGHT AND HONORABLY PROTECT CLOUD DESPITE HIS OWN DESIRE TO RETURN TO EARTH AND SAVE HIMSELF
YOU1000000021_S0000194	AGAINST ALL ODDS ZACK TRIUMPHS IN HIS FINAL STAND BUT HE IS ON HIS LAST LEGS AS SHINNER BECOMES REINFORCING THEIR TROOPS FIRING COUNTLESS BULLETS INTO A RELENTLESS ZACK
YOU1000000021_S0000199	MEANWHILE CLOUD FINALLY WAKES UP AND DRAGS HIMSELF OVER TO SACK WHO WAS STILL BARELY ALIVE AND FORCES A SMILE FOR HIM AND URGES CLOUD TO LIVE ON IN HIS STEAD AS HIS OWN LIVING LEGACY
YOU1000000021_S0000204	AS THE GAME ENDS THE TRAUMA OF THE EVENTS UNFORTUNATELY RESULTED IN CLOUD BLOCKING ALL MEMORY OF THAT DESPITE HIS PROMISE
YOU1000000027_S0000009	ALL RIGHT THE NEXT JOURNALING PROMPT IS SOMETHING THAT I LEARNED FROM MY FRIENDS KAJO PANDAY THIS PAST SUNDAY ACTUALLY WE DID A LIVE CHAT TOGETHER ON FACEBOOK IF YOU WANT TO WATCH THAT FULL LIVE CHAT IT'S REALLY AMAZING
YOU1000000033_S0000008	AND HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE TODAY JESUS SAYS TO EACH ONE OF US I CAME THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE LIFE AND HAVE IT TO THE FULL THE QUESTION IS DO WE WANT IT
YOU1000000033_S0000026	WHEN I WAS TWENTY YEARS OLD IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT MY SISTER CONVINCED ME TO GO TO A CONFERENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME AND I ALWAYS WANTED TO SEE NOTRE DAME TOUCHDOWN JESUS I THOUGHT I'D GO
YOU1000000033_S0000070	AND THEN I UH GOT INVOLVED IN THE CHARISMATIC RENAISSANCE MOVEMENT AND THEN CARDINAL SONNY ASKED ME TO MOVE TO BELGIUM SO IT ISN'T LIKE I HAD A PLAN
YOU1000000033_S0000084	WELL I BEGAN WITH RENAILED MINISTRIES BACK IN ACTUALLY I I KNEW RALPH FOR QUITE A NUMBER OF YEARS AND WE SPOKE AT SOME CONFERENCES TOGETHER AND CERTAINLY HAD SOMEWHAT OF A COMMON MIND
YOU1000000033_S0000085	AND THEN PETER CAME INTO THE PICTURE AS WELL AND THE THREE OF US JUST AT DIFFERENT TIMES COLLABORATING AT AT A CONFERENCE SOMEWHERE WE BEGAN TO SEE THAT WE ALL HAD A KIND OF SIMILAR MESSAGE
YOU1000000033_S0000094	HOW IT ALL BEGAN I DON'T KNOW FOR ARTHUR MENTIONED THIS BUT KIND OF HOW IT ALL BEGAN WAS HE AND I WENT TO A HEAR A TALK IN DETROIT AT A LARGE CONFERENCE WE CAN'T WANT TO HEAR ONE SPEAKER AT THIS LARGER CONFERENCE
YOU1000000033_S0000099	AND THEY STARTED PRAYING FIRST WITH RALPH AND I'M JUST KIND OF WATCHING AND AND IT WAS THE ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES WHERE I SAW THE GIFT OF PROPHECY KIND OF AND WORD OF KNOWLEDGE WORKING IN A IN A VERY POWERFUL WAY
YOU1000000033_S0000100	AND THEY STARTED SAYING THINGS ABOUT RALPH AND ABOUT HIS LIFE WHICH THEY COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN THAT WERE INDICATIONS OF HOW GOD HAD WORKED IN HIM AND AND WHAT THE LORD WANTED TO DO WITH HIM
YOU1000000033_S0000105	AND SO AFTER IT WAS ALL DONE WE WERE DRIVING HOME AND SAYING WOW WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THAT YOU KNOW AND RALPH SAID JUST SAID YOU KNOW YOU KNOW SCRIPTURE IS VERY CLEAR IT SAYS DID NEVER DESPISE PROPHECY BUT TEST EVERYTHING AND CLING TO WHAT IS GOOD
YOU1000000033_S0000154	YOU KNOW WAS LIKE LIKE LIKE TO YOU KNOW OF COURSE SO WE UH WE WENT THERE AND AFTER MASS WHEN HE CAME TO RALPH WHO IS NEXT TO ME
YOU1000000033_S0000158	AND I KNEW HE DIDN'T WANT THE WHOLE THREE HUNDRED PAGE ANSWER SO I SAID HOLY FATHER I THINK WHAT THE SPIRIT IS SAYING TO THE CHURCH IS JESUS SO HE TOOK MY HAND AND HE SAID JESUS AND I SAID JESUS
YOU1000000033_S0000160	JOHN PAUL THE SECOND IS OUR PATRON YOU KNOW ONE ARE ONE OF OUR CENTRAL THE CENTRAL PATRON MAYBE OF OF RENAISSANCE MINISTRIES AND SO HE'S A GREAT INTERCESSOR FOR US WE CONTINUE TO PRAY WE ASK FOR HIS HELP I FEEL HIS PRESENCE ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M ON A MISSION INTERNATIONALLY
YOU1000000033_S0000169	AND MORE AND MORE WE'RE LIVING IN THE GROWTH OF AN INTERNATIONAL PAGAN CULTURE THAT'S BECOMING INCREASINGLY HOSTILE TO CHRIST IN THE CHURCH WHERE IS THEIR LOYALTY
YOU1000000033_S0000181	YOU KNOW PETER WHEN YOU'RE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT EVERY DAY AND YOU'RE GETTING UP EVERY DAY AND DO WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO SOMETIMES YOU DON'T GET THE WHOLE TRAJECTORY OF WHAT GOD'S DONE AND IT'S JUST AMAZING TO SEE WHAT THE LORD'S DONE WITH WITH US

YOU1000000128_S0000011	AND LET US GET US CLOSE TO HOME LET US GET US TO EUROPE AND ONE OF THESE THINGS THAT I'VE SEEN GEORGE DO TIME AND TIME AGAIN IN EUROPE IS SOMETHING THAT ALSO TO REALLY CORRECT AND THAT IS STANDING UP FOR THE UNDERDOG
YOU1000000128_S0000030	THAT'S WHEN IRANIAN GENERAL SOLEIMANI WAS ASSASSINATED IN IRAQ
YOU1000000129_S0000008	CARNEGIE WAS AT ONE POINT THE RICHEST AMERICAN IN HISTORY BUT HE WASN'T BORN IN AMERICA
YOU1000000129_S0000009	ANDREW'S STORY BEGINS ACROSS THE ATLANTIC OCEAN IN DUNFERMLINE SCOTLAND WHERE HE GREW UP IN WHAT COULD ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS ABJECT POVERTY
YOU1000000129_S0000022	CARNEGIE WOULD PROFIT FROM IT HE WAS ABLE TO ESCAPE HARM'S WAY AFTER PAYING EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS FOR A SUBSTITUTE TO TAKE HIS PLACE ON THE BATTLEFIELD IT WAS DURING THIS TIME THAT CARNEGIE NOTICED THAT THE WOODEN BRIDGES WERE EASILY BURNED BY THE TROOPS
YOU1000000129_S0000025	OWNING THE IRON SOURCE MEANT THAT CARNEGIE'S BRIDGE BUILDING COMPANY WOULD NOT BE DEPENDENT ON MINING OR EXTRACTING COMPANIES FOR IRON LIKE THEIR COMPETITORS THIS NOT ONLY GAVE CARNEGIE MORE CONTROL OVER THE ENTIRE PROCESS IT ALSO IMPROVED THEIR MARGINS
YOU1000000129_S0000044	HENRY CLAY FRICK AS A TEAM CARNEGIE AND FRICK WERE A POWERFUL FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH AND TO SHOW HOW RUTHLESS THE TWO COULD BE LOOK NO FARTHER THAN THE STORY ABOUT DUCAINE WORKS
YOU1000000129_S0000059	IN EIGHTEEN NINETY EIGHT NINE PERCENT OF ALL STEEL WORKERS INDUSTRY WIDE WOULD DIE ON THE JOB WHEN THE WORKERS REFUSED FRICK'S AGGRESSIVE DEMANDS FOR LONGER HOURS AND LESS PAY HE DECIDED TO LOCK OUT ALL EMPLOYEES
YOU1000000129_S0000076	AS THE STORY GOES JP MORGAN GLANCED AT THE OFFER AND WITHOUT HESITATION ACCEPTED IT MORGAN WOULD BUY CANNEGIE STEEL FOR FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS MAKING CANNEGIE THE SINGLE RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD AT THE TIME
YOU1000000129_S0000077	CARNEGIE WOULD COMPLETELY CUT TIES WITH HIS BUSINESS LIFE AND DEDICATE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF HIMSELF TO SERVING THE WORLD THROUGH PHILANTHROPY NOT A SINGLE DOLLAR WOULD BE LEFT TO HIS FAMILY
YOU1000000129_S0000078	BECAUSE ANDREW HAD ONLY FIVE YEARS OF SCHOOLING HE HAD A SOFT SPOT FOR LIBRARIES WHICH HE CREDITS FOR HELPING HIM ACHIEVE THE FINANCIAL SUCCESS HE ACQUIRED
YOU1000000129_S0000080	ONE EXAMPLE OF HIS GENEROSITY IS CARNEGIE HALL ONE OF NEW YORK'S MOST RECOGNIZABLE LANDMARKS BUILT IN EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE CARNEGIE BUILT AND DONATED THE BUILDING AS THE MUSIC HALL
YOU1000000129_S0000085	PERHAPS HE VIEWED DONATING HIS MONEY AS A WAY TO ATONE FOR HIS BUSINESS SINS MAKING MONEY IS A GREAT FEELING BUT AN EVEN BETTER FEELING IS GIVING IT AWAY IF YOU WANT TO GROW WEALTH AND PERHAPS DONATE TO NOBLE CAUSES LIKE KARENEIGH DID
YOU1000000130_S0000011	BY THE TIME HENRY HAD BECOME A TEENAGER THE STEAM ENGINE WAS ALREADY MAKING ITS WAY INTO THE FARMING COMMUNITY COW POWERED THRESHING MACHINES AND SAWMILLS WERE BECOMING COMMON SIGHT AND HENRY WAS LEARNING HOW THEY WORKED AND HOW TO FIX THEM
YOU1000000130_S0000017	IT IS DURING THIS TIME THAT HENRY BY CHANCE LEARNED ABOUT THE GAS ENGINE FROM A BRITISH MAGAZINE IT WAS BEING PRODUCED IN SMALL NUMBERS BY A GERMAN ENGINEER NICHOLAS
YOU1000000130_S0000018	AND IT WAS GAINING SOME TRACTION IN EUROPE BUT IT WAS PRACTICALLY UNHEARD OF IN AMERICA HENRY WOULD GET THE CHANCE TO WORK ON SUCH AN ENGINE HIMSELF IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE AND HE INSTANTLY RECOGNIZED THE ADVANTAGES IT HAD
YOU1000000130_S0000020	THIS ALSO ALLOWED THE GAS ENGINE TO START QUICKLY WHEREAS STEAM ENGINES OF THE TIME NEEDED AS MUCH AS THIRTY MINUTES TO HEAT UP THE WATER AND GENERATE ENOUGH STEAM TO START WORKING THE GAS ENGINE WAS AN INNOVATION HENRY FELL IN LOVE WITH
YOU1000000130_S0000023	IT WAS GENERATING ELECTRICITY FOR OVER A THOUSAND HOMES IN DETROIT AND IT WAS DOING SO BY USING STEAM ENGINES SO HENRY WAS A NATURAL HIRE FOR THEM WHENEVER THE ENGINES BROKE HENRY HAD TO FIX THEM BUT WHENEVER THEY WERE WORKING
YOU1000000130_S0000029	HE HAD DRIVEN A THOUSAND MILES IN HENRY BUILT A SECOND QUADRICYCLE AND THEN A THIRD ONE ALWAYS IMPROVING THE DESIGN BEFORE FINALLY FEELING CONFIDENT ENOUGH IN EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE TO START HIS OWN COMPANY
YOU1000000130_S0000032	AND EVERYONE WAS EAGER TO SEE WHAT HENRY COULD CREATE WITH PROPER CAPITAL HENRY'S PLAN WAS VERY CLEVER SINCE HE PERSONALLY KNEW MANY OF THE INDUSTRIALISTS IN DETROIT BY THAT POINT HE'D TRY TO BUILD AN AUTOMOBILE THEY COULD USE IN THEIR BUSINESSES
YOU1000000130_S0000033	HE LEASED A FACTORY AND PLANNED TO HIRE A HUNDRED WORKERS TO MAKE HIS NEW DELIVERY WAGON AS HE CALLED IT BUT IT TURNED OUT THAT BUILDING SUCH COMPLEX MACHINES IN HIGH NUMBERS WAS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT THAN HENRY IMAGINED
YOU1000000130_S0000041	HENRY LABELED HIS FIRST DESIGN AS THE MODEL A AND WORKED HIS WAY THROUGH THE ALPHABET OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS SUSTAINED BY CAPITAL FROM HIS FRIENDS AND FAMILY
YOU1000000130_S0000044	THE BIGGEST GAME CHANGER OF ALL HOWEVER WAS HENRY'S CHANCE VISIT TO A SLAUGHTERHOUSE IN CHICAGO HE SAW THERE WAS SOMETHING INTERESTING A DISASSEMBLY LINE SO TO SPEAK WHERE MULTIPLE WORKERS WOULD PROCESS CARCASSES MOVING DOWN THE LINE
YOU1000000130_S0000049	IT IS ACTUALLY DURING THE PRODUCTION OF THIS MODEL THAT HENRY WOULD FIRST USE THE ASSEMBLY LINE PROCESS TO AT LEAST PARTIALLY ASSEMBLE SOME OF HIS CARS
YOU1000000130_S0000060	THEY WOULD HELP HIM TRANSITION HIS ENTIRE MANUFACTURING PROCESS TO USE VANADIUM STEEL IT WAS THEIR CHIEF ENGINEER THAT BUILT THE HEAT TREATMENT PLANT FOR HENRY IN
YOU1000000130_S0000068	HENRY HAD BEGUN A NEW AGE IN AMERICAN HISTORY THE AGE OF THE AUTOMOBILE AND IT WAS HIS COMPANY THAT WOULD TOTALLY DOMINATE IT IN ITS FIRST TWO DECADES
YOU1000000130_S0000069	IT WASN'T UNTIL THE END OF THE NINETEEN TWENTIES THAT THE REST OF THE AUTO INDUSTRY CAUGHT UP TO HENRY BUT AT THAT POINT HE WAS ALREADY ONE OF THE RICHEST MEN ALIVE
YOU1000000131_S0000005	THE ORIGINS OF HISTORY'S GREATEST OIL MONOPOLY ARE ACTUALLY PRETTY HUMBLE IT ALL STARTS IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE WITH THE BIRTH OF JOHN ROCKEFELLER IN UPSTATE NEW YORK HE WAS THE ELDEST SON OF A TRAVELING MERCHANT
YOU1000000131_S0000008	SO THEY COULD ALL LIVE TOGETHER IN THIS VERY CONFUSING HOUSEHOLD JOHN WOULD GROW UP LEARNING HOW TO HASSLE PEOPLE FOR THE BEST DEAL POSSIBLE AND HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF EVERY PENNY HE GOT HIS FAMILY WOULD RARELY STAY IN ONE PLACE FOR LONG
YOU1000000131_S0000009	AND JOHN WOULD LIVE THIS NOMADIC LIFESTYLE EVER SINCE HE WAS THREE YEARS OLD TO HELP HIS MOTHER JOHN WOULD EARN ANY MONEY HE COULD BY RAISING TURKEYS OR DOING WORK FOR NEIGHBORS HIS INTELLIGENCE WAS PUT TO GOOD USE
YOU1000000131_S0000012	THANKS TO HIS GOOD REPUTATION HE GOT A LOAN OF FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH AT THE TIME WAS A HUGE SUM JOHN STARTED TRADING HAY GRAIN AND VARIOUS MEATS AND IN HIS FIRST YEAR HE RECORDED SALES OF HALF A MILLION DOLLARS
YOU1000000131_S0000019	FOR THE BIPRODUCTS OF REFINING PETROLEUM YOU SEE THE EARLY REFINERIES IN CLEVELAND COULD ONLY OPERATE AT ABOUT A SIXTY PERCENT EFFICIENCY BUT JOHN NOT ONLY INCREASED THAT PERCENTAGE HE ALSO STARTED SELLING ALL THE BIPRODUCTS LIKE PARAPHENOL

POD1000000010_S0000098	AND TOM TOLD US THAT BABY'S MORAL SENSE SEEMS TO GO EVEN DEEPER
POD1000000010_S0000100	SO THIS IS LIKE I WAS SAYING KORY I ALWAYS THOUGHT KIDS ARE JUST BORN TO BE KIND
POD1000000010_S0000103	ONLY ABOUT A THIRD OF THE KIDS ACTUALLY RESPONDED IN THAT MOMENT WITH ALTRUISM WITH KINDNESS BY SAY GOING OVER TO THE CHILD OFFERING A HUG CALLING FOR AN ADULT
POD1000000010_S0000104	THAT'S ACTUALLY
POD1000000010_S0000106	LET'S TRACK ON HERE BELLA HE'S TRYING TO TRACK ON YOU
POD1000000010_S0000109	I GOT HOW FAR AWAY
POD1000000010_S0000112	MELISSA HOW YOU BELONG
POD1000000010_S0000138	AND THAT'S WHY SCARLETT SAYS
POD1000000010_S0000144	THE JESSE LEWIS CHOOSE LOVE PROGRAM FOR KIDS FROM PRE K THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL ACTUALLY BEGINS WITH COURAGE
POD1000000010_S0000145	AND I WANT TO MENTION THAT REPORTS OF THE SHOOTING SAID THAT JESSE HIMSELF SHOWED INCREDIBLE COURAGE
POD1000000010_S0000147	YEAH AND SCARLET'S DEFINITION OF COURAGE IS EVEN BIGGER THAN THAT SORT OF
POD1000000010_S0000154	IT'S ALSO SCARLETT SAYS THE COURAGE TO STAND UP TO SOMEONE WHO'S BULLYING YOU OR SOMEONE YOU KNOW BY TAKING THEIR PERSPECTIVE AND SEEING THE WORLD THROUGH THEIR EYES
POD1000000010_S0000160	YOU KNOW HEARING ABOUT COURAGE IN THAT WAY IN THAT MOMENT REALLY SPOKE TO ME CORY BECAUSE I HAVE TO ADMIT THIS
POD1000000010_S0000161	I WAS A LITTLE AFRAID TO SIT DOWN WITH SCARLET
POD1000000010_S0000165	ONE REALLY PRACTICAL WAY SCARLETT'S CHOOSE LOVE PLAN BUILDS COURAGE IS BY TEACHING KIDS TO STAY CALM
POD1000000010_S0000170	JEN COTTLER AT SESAME SAYS IF YOU'RE MORE AWARE OF YOUR EMOTIONS YOU'LL ALSO BE MORE AWARE OF EVERYONE ELSE'S
POD1000000010_S0000186	YEAH BEFORE JEN STARTED AT SESAME WORKSHOP SHE SPENT HER DAYS IN A CLASSROOM
POD1000000010_S0000190	THE PROBLEM JEN FOUND OUT WITH FORCED APOLOGIES AS THAT THEY'RE USUALLY PRETTY WORTHLESS
POD1000000010_S0000193	YEAH SO TOM LICONA AND JEN COTTLER BOTH TOLD US INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON KIDS PARENTING THE WORDS SORRY
POD1000000010_S0000196	JEN SAYS YOU CAN ACTUALLY TAKE A MOMENT LIKE THIS
POD1000000010_S0000200	JEN SAYS SESAME STREET HAS IMPROVED OVER TIME IN HOW IT DEPICTS APOLOGIES ON THE SHOW
POD1000000010_S0000202	SO ELMO MIGHT SAY I WAS REALLY WANTING TO PLAY WITH MY SCOOTER AND I DIDN'T WANT TO SHARE IT
POD1000000010_S0000206	YOU GET IT SCOTT

POD1000000010_S0000209	SO WHAT DO YOU SAY ZOE
POD1000000010_S0000214	ALL RIGHT NICE JOB SHARING
POD1000000010_S0000228	YOU HURT AMY
POD1000000010_S0000231	TOM ALSO SAYS THAT CHILDREN SHOULD LEARN TO MAKE AN APOLOGY OF ACTION
POD1000000010_S0000236	AND SCARLETT LEWIS SAYS THAT MEANS WHEN PARENTS GREW UP WE NEED TO APOLOGIZE TOO
POD1000000010_S0000240	IF ANYTHING SCARLETT TALKS EVEN MORE ABOUT THE OTHER SIDE OF AN APOLOGY FORGIVENESS
POD1000000010_S0000250	I LOVE THIS TOO BECAUSE SCARLETT IS REALLY FOCUSING ON THE BENEFIT OF LETTING GO OF ANGER
POD1000000010_S0000252	AND IT WAS AT THIS POINT WE'RE SITTING WITH SCARLETT IN HER KITCHEN HER BACK IS TO A REFRIGERATOR WHICH IS COVERED WITH PHOTOS OF JESSE AND HER OTHER SON J T AND WE JUST HAD TO ASK
POD1000000010_S0000268	AJA SIMMONS HELPS RUN THE SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL PROGRAMS FOR SCHOOLS IN OAKLAND CALIFORNIA
POD1000000010_S0000277	TOM LICKONA SAYS IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT CELEBRATING KIND ACTIONS
POD1000000010_S0000281	YEAH PART OF HOW SCARLETT KEEPS GOING SHE TOLD US IS BY CONSTANTLY REMINDING HERSELF EVEN OUT LOUD WHAT SHE'S GRATEFUL FOR
POD1000000010_S0000285	AND TOM AGREES
POD1000000010_S0000302	THAT'S A GREAT POINT CORY I'VE GOT TO TRY THAT
POD1000000010_S0000306	YEAH IN FACT SCARLETT LEWIS SAYS
POD1000000010_S0000308	AND SIMILARLY TOM SAYS KINDNESS AS A VIRTUE ISN'T RANDOM IT'S A HABIT
POD1000000010_S0000313	SO TOM SAYS YOU KNOW NOT FOR AN ALLOWANCE BUT JUST TO GIVE THE MESSAGE THAT THIS IS WHAT WE DO TO HELP OUT BECAUSE WE'RE PART OF SOMETHING BIGGER
POD1000000010_S0000314	AND FOR MY DAUGHTER LULU WHO'S SEVEN THAT CHORE REALLY IS TAKING CARE OF THE CAT
POD1000000010_S0000322	AND HERE'S A REALLY GOOD NEWS TOM TOLD US
POD1000000010_S0000327	AND THAT'S WHY HE SAYS WE'RE HAPPIER WHEN WE'RE HELPING AND JENNETTE SASSEY AGREES
POD1000000010_S0000329	AND THAT'S WHY SCARLETT SAYS WE SHOULD TALK TO KIDS DIRECTLY ABOUT THIS HELPERS HIGH

POD1000000017_S0000009	AT SOME POINT BRIGHT HAS TO GO RUN AN ARROW AND I THINK I MIGHT HAVE SENT HIM ON ONE I DON'T REMEMBER BUT HE'S GONE SO I'M ALONE JUST ME WITH THE VEGETABLES AND AND YEAH ROCK
POD1000000017_S0000019	STEAL AWAY BY ROBIN DUPREE
POD1000000017_S0000031	I'M HEARING THINGS LIKE ROSANA BY TOTO
POD1000000017_S0000041	THERE IS SOMETHING JAZZ LIKE IN THE SYNCOPATED MUSIC OF SOMETHING LIKE STEELY DAN
POD1000000017_S0000043	YOU CAN HEAR IN SOMEBODY LIKE MICHAEL MCDONALD
POD1000000017_S0000049	AND THE SONG IN WHICH I AM HEARING IT THE DEEPEST AND STRONGEST AND MOST POWERFULLY AT LEAST TO ME STANDING IN THAT KITCHEN SHOPPING THOSE VEGETABLES WAS WHEN KENNY LOGGINS THIS IS IT COMES
POD1000000017_S0000053	KENNY LOGGINS IS BASICALLY SING WHISPERING THE VERSES OF THIS SONG
POD1000000017_S0000058	AND THEN IN THE PRE CHORUS KENNY LOGGINS DISAPPEARS AND WHO SHOWS UP MICHAEL MCDONALD
POD1000000017_S0000060	GIVING PENNY LOGGINS PLENTY OF TIME TO GATHER HIMSELF
POD1000000017_S0000066	SCRAPING THE PAN IS THE BLACKEST THING YOU CAN DO AS A SINGER AND HERE IS KENNY LOGGINS AS THIS WHITE ARTIST DOING IT
POD1000000017_S0000078	I'M THINKING ABOUT AMY WHITEHOUSE
POD1000000017_S0000080	I'M SEEING ABOUT ANY LINKS
POD1000000017_S0000082	THINKING ABOUT GEORGE MICHAEL
POD1000000017_S0000084	I THINK ABOUT CHRIS DABOLTON TO SPEND MY NIGHTS
POD1000000017_S0000087	AND ONE OF THE MANY PHASES IN WHICH DAVID BOWIE REALLY WANTED TO MAKE R AND B AND SOUL MUSIC
POD1000000017_S0000089	THIS IS THE SOUND NOT JUST OF BLACK AMERICA BUT THE SOUND OF AMERICA IT IS DEEPLY AMERICAN ALMOST ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S SUNG BY BRITISH PEOPLE LIKE DAVID BOWIE AND ANNE LENNIX AND AMY WINEHOUSE
POD1000000017_S0000103	AND THEN THIS ONE WILL BE TO THE LANDING CORNER YOU HAVE SOMEONE LIKE BILLY MCCRAY
POD1000000017_S0000114	IT'S WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE HEARD PASSING A BLACK PERSON DOING HIS JOB ENTERTAINING HIMSELF DOING THE DRUDGERY OF WORK THE WAY A GUY NAMED THOMAS DARTMOUTH RICE DID SOMETIME AROUND THE EIGHTEEN THIRTIES
POD1000000017_S0000116	ONE DAY HE'S TOURING WITH A TROOP IN CINCINNATI OR MAYBE IT WAS PITTSBURGH WE DON'T REALLY KNOW BUT THE MYTH BASICALLY GOES TED RACE HAPPENED UPON AN OLD BLACK MAN CLEANING A HORSE IN A STABLE
POD1000000017_S0000117	THE MAN WAS DOING HIS JOB ON PROPERTY OWNED BY A WHITE MAN NAMED CROW
POD1000000017_S0000122	WHATEVER RICE HERE IS COMING OUT OF THIS MAN'S MOUTH IS CAPTIVATING TO HIM AND WHAT HE SEES IS AN OPPORTUNITY
POD1000000017_S0000133	AND SO WHEN TATIANA RICE HEARS THIS BLACK MAN SINGING THIS SONG AND MOVING HIS BODY IN THIS PARTICULAR WAY DING A LIGHT BUBBLE GOES OFF
POD1000000017_S0000140	COME LISTEN ALL YOU GALS AND BOYS I'M JUST FROM TUCKAHOE I'M GONNA SING A LITTLE SONG MY NAME'S JIM CROW
POD1000000017_S0000142	AND THE LYRICS GIVE THE HORSE CORNER A NAME AND THE NAME IS JIM CROW
POD1000000017_S0000146	THIS IS THE FIRST TIME A PAYING AUDIENCE IS BASICALLY ELECTRIFIED BY A WHITE MAN WITH A BLACK FACE THIS IS THE NIGHT THAT JIM CROW WAS ALLOCATED TO AMERICA THIS MASCOT OF AMERICAN RACISM
POD1000000017_S0000148	AND HERE IS THOMAS DARTMOUTH RICE GIVING IT TO THEM THIS IS THE NIGHT THAT AMERICAN POPULAR CULTURE WAS BORN
POD1000000017_S0000151	SO YOU HAVE OTHER MINISTRIAL ACTS WHO COME ALONG AND TRY TO DO WHAT THOMAS DARTMOUTH RICE IS DOING A SONG AND A DANCE
POD1000000017_S0000175	SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE HAVING THESE DREAMS GO ON TO BECOME PEOPLE LIKE STEPHEN FOSTER
POD1000000017_S0000177	EVEN FASTER THE MAN WIDELY CREDITED AS BEING THE FATHER OF AMERICAN MUSIC
POD1000000017_S0000197	F B MILLER AND SCOTT MAN CORRESPONDENT
POD1000000017_S0000210	D W GRIFFITHS THE BIRTH OF A NATION FULL OF WHITE MEN VILLAINOUSLY AND BLACK FACE
POD1000000017_S0000220	JUDY GARLAND PERFORMED IN BLACK FACE
POD1000000017_S0000222	BEING CROSBY AND FRIDAY ARE BOTH PERFORMED IN BLACK FACE
POD1000000017_S0000227	OUT OF THESE RECORDINGS YOU HAVE PEOPLE LIKE MUDDY WATERS
POD1000000017_S0000237	YOU HAVE THE ADVENT OF A PLACE LIKE BLUE NOTE RECORDS WHERE LOTS OF AMAZING JAZZ WAS CREATED AND THEN RELEASED INTO THE WORLD PEOPLE LIKE SIDNEY BECHETTE
POD1000000017_S0000239	LOUIS ARMSTRONG
POD1000000017_S0000241	AND DUKE ELLINGTON
POD1000000018_S0000000	WHEN ANDY GRIFFITH PASSED AWAY IN TWENTY TWELVE CNN COVERED HIS DEATH OFTEN ON THE ENTIRE DAY
POD1000000018_S0000003	LARRY KING IS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO CALLED HIM TO TALK THAT DAY HE'D HAD ANDY ON HIS VARIOUS SHOWS NUMEROUS TIMES AND HE MENTIONED SOMETHING IN PASSING THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING
POD1000000018_S0000005	WHAT LARRY SAID IS THAT A LAWYER NAMED PERCY FOREMAN WAS THE MAN WHO INSPIRED THE CHARACTER MATLOCK
POD1000000018_S0000007	THIS WAS A WEIRD THING FOR ANYONE TO SAY BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE EVEN TODAY BELIEVE THAT CHARACTER TO BE BASED ON A DIFFERENT LAWYER NAMED BOBBY LEE COOK
POD1000000018_S0000009	HOWEVER IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THREE YEARS AFTER LARRY KING SAID SOMETHING THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD ASSUME WAS INCORRECT THE CREATOR OF MATLOCK DID CONFIRM THAT THE CHARACTER WAS BASED ON PERCY FOREMAN
POD1000000018_S0000012	PERCY WAS ABLE TO ACHIEVE THIS RECORD BY BEING AN INCREDIBLE LAWYER NO DENYING IT BUT ALSO DUE TO THE TEXAS COURT SYSTEM'S PRACTICE OF USING JURIES TO DETERMINE GUILT AS WELL AS SENTENCING IN THE CASE OF A GUILTY VERDICT
POD1000000018_S0000016	PERCY HAD TWELVE AVERAGE CITIZENS FROM THE LOCAL COMMUNITY SITTING RIGHT THERE WAITING TO BE CONVINCED THAT THE VICTIM IN THIS SITUATION WASN'T A VICTIM AT ALL
POD1000000018_S0000019	FORMER AND CALLED IT MISDEMEANOR MURDER THAT'S WHERE A JURY MIGHT CONVICT YOU OF ENDING ANOTHER PERSON'S LIFE AND SEND YOU ON YOUR WAY WITH THE TYPE OF PUNISHMENT YOU'D RECEIVE FOR A MISDEMEANOR CRIME
POD1000000018_S0000021	PERCY FOREMAN HAD SUCH A LONG RUN OF WINS WITH THIS STRATEGY THAT IT'S STILL BEING USED IN TEXAS TODAY PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS SORT OF THING WILL SOMETIMES REFER TO IT AS THE TEXAS DEFENSE
POD1000000018_S0000023	NOW JIM DENNY WASN'T FROM TEXAS HE WAS FROM TENNESSEE
POD1000000018_S0000025	WHEN A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD JIM DENNEY GOT HIRED TO WORK THE MAILROOM OF WSM RADIO'S PARENT COMPANY HE MUST HAVE SEEN IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF HIMSELF
POD1000000018_S0000027	DENNY GOT THIS JOB IN NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN THAT YEAR THE YOUNG RADIO PROGRAM WS M BARN DANS WAS REFERRED TO AS THE GRAND OLE OPRY FOR THE FIRST TIME ON AIR
POD1000000018_S0000029	EVERY TIME AN ODD JOB CAME UP AT THE OPRY ALL LEONARD JIM WOULD TAKE IT SO HE COULD HANG OUT BACKSTAGE SEE THE ARTISTS AND SEE HOW THE SHOW WAS MADE
POD1000000018_S0000030	WITHIN TWENTY YEARS DENNY HAD WORKED HIS WAY UP TO DIRECTOR OF THE ARTIST SERVICE BOARD AT WHICH MEANT HE WAS IN CHARGE OF BOOKING THE AX ON THE OPRY
POD1000000018_S0000032	THERE'S A FEW FUNNY THINGS FROM JIM DENNEY'S TIME AT THE GRAND OLE OPRY LIKE THE ONE ABOUT ELVIS PRESLEY'S BIG DEBUT
POD1000000018_S0000033	ELVIS WAS STILL A TEENAGER WHEN DENNY DID SAM PHILLIPS THE FAVOR OF LETTING ELVIS COME ON THE SHOW TO PLAY HIS NOT COUNTRY ARRANGEMENT OF BLUE MOON OF KENTUCKY
POD1000000018_S0000035	IT DIDN'T GO WELL DENNY IS RUMORED TO HAVE TOLD ELVIS BACKSTAGE YOU DON'T GO IN NOWHERE SON YOU HAD TO GO BACK TO DRIVE A TRUCK
POD1000000018_S0000037	DENNY'S ALSO THE GUY WHO FIRED HANK WILLIAMS OVER THE TELEPHONE AND THERE'S THE TIME WHEN JIM MADE JOHNNY CASH WAIT OUTSIDE HIS OFFICE FOR TWO HOURS BEFORE LETTING HIM IN TO ASK WHY CASH SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO PLAY ON THE OPRY
POD1000000018_S0000039	CASH MENTIONED THAT HE PRESENTLY HAD A SONG CALLED I WALK THE LINE IN THE TOP TEN
POD1000000018_S0000041	JIM DENNEY WAS WHAT MANY PEOPLE REFERRED TO IN THOSE TIMES AS A HARD MAN TODAY I THINK THEY'D HAVE SOME DIFFERENT WORDS FOR HIM AND THAT'S WHY ERNEST TUBB TRIED TO SHOOT HIM IN NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN
POD1000000018_S0000044	MY NAME IS TYLER MAHAN CO I'VE HEARD THESE STORIES MY WHOLE LIFE
POD1000000018_S0000047	IT'S SHOCKING TO HEAR ERNEST TUBB'S NAME ASSOCIATED WITH ANY KIND OF VIOLENCE WHATSOEVER
POD1000000018_S0000051	CRISP TEXAS IS A GHOST TOWN NOW ERNEST TUBB WAS BORN THERE IN NINETEEN FOURTEEN INTO A FAMILY OF SHARECROPPERS LIKE MOST SHARECROPPERS CHILDREN ERNEST GREW UP WORKING ON FARMS ALL OVER THE AREA
POD1000000018_S0000054	LIKE A GREAT NUMBER OF ARTISTS WILL LEARN ABOUT IN FUTURE EPISODES IT WAS ALL OVER FOR A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD ERNEST TUBB THE FIRST TIME HE HEARD JIMMY RODGERS
POD1000000018_S0000058	HEARING JIMMY RODGERS IS WHAT LED ERNEST TUBB TO DECIDE HE SIMPLY HAD TO BECOME A COUNTRY SINGER
POD1000000018_S0000059	IT'S ALSO VERY SPECIFICALLY WHAT CAUSED HIM THREE DECADES LATER TO WANT TO SHOOT A THREE FIFTY SEVEN MAGNUM AT JIM DENNY
POD1000000018_S0000062	THE DEATH OF HIS IDOL WAS EXTREMELY UPSETTING FOR ERNEST HOWEVER IT ALSO MADE HIM REALIZE THAT HE WAS GOING TO HAVE TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT CHASING HIS DREAMS
POD1000000018_S0000067	HOLDING DOWN THREE JOBS AT ONCE WAS NECESSARY TO SUPPORT HIMSELF AND HIS YOUNG WIFE ELAINE THEY DIDN'T WASTE ANY TIME BEFORE STARTING TO HAVE KIDS EITHER
POD1000000018_S0000069	ERNEST WAS MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK HARD IF IT KEPT HIM MOVING TOWARDS THE LIFE OF HIS HERO JIMMY RODGERS
POD1000000018_S0000070	HE'D HAD THIS SMALL PICTURE OF JIMMY FOR YEARS NOW AND IT WAS IN PRETTY BAD SHAPE SO HE GOT A PHONE BOOK AND LOOKED UP THE NUMBER FOR JIMMY RODGER'S WIDOW
POD1000000018_S0000071	HE CALLED HER ON THE PHONE TO EXPLAIN THAT HE WAS SUCH A BIG FAN AND TO SEE IF SHE HAPPENED TO HAVE A BIGGER BETTER PHOTO OF JIMMY THAT ERNEST COULD HAVE MAYBE EVEN ONE THAT WAS AUTOGRAPHED
POD1000000018_S0000072	KERRY WAS SUPER NICE AND SHE DID HAVE SUCH A PHOTO THAT ERIN'S COULD HAVE AND WENT SO FAR AS TO INVITE HIM OUT TO HER HOUSE IN CARRIVILLE TEXAS TO GET THE PICTURE
POD1000000018_S0000073	ERNEST DROVE OUT THERE THE NEXT SUNDAY HE WASN'T WORKING TAKING ELAINE AND THEIR BABY JUSTIN ON THE TRIP
POD1000000018_S0000075	THEY'D PLANNED TO STAY FOR MAYBE TEN MINUTES AND ENDED UP HANGING OUT FOR OVER TWO HOURS LOOKING AT COSTUMES GUITARS AND PICTURES BROUGHT OUT BY MISSUS ROGER'S HEARING HER STORIES ABOUT HOW HIGH ON THE HOG THEY'D LIVED MERELY A FEW YEARS EARLIER
POD1000000018_S0000076	ET COULD NEVER HAVE GUESSED WHEN HE WOKE UP THAT MORNING THAT HE'D BE LAYING DOWN TO SLEEP THAT NIGHT HAVING HELD JIMMY ROGER'S SIGNATURE MARTIN ACOUSTIC GUITAR WITH JIMMY'S NAME INLAID IN PERL ACROSS THE FRETBOARD AND THE WORD THANKS WRITTEN ON THE BACK UPSIDE DOWN
POD1000000018_S0000080	OKAY NOW ADD THIS ON TOP OF THAT A FEW MONTHS LATER CARRIE RODGERS CALLED ERNEST TO SAY SHE'D LISTENED FOR HIS RADIO SHOW AS HE'D ASKED FOR HER TO DO
POD1000000018_S0000082	ON THE OTHER HAND SHE DIDN'T THINK HE SOUNDED LIKE JIMMY RODGERS WHEN HE SANG WHICH IS BASICALLY THE ONLY THING IN THE WORLD ERNEST TUBB WANTED TO DO IN THIS PHASE OF HIS LIFE
POD1000000018_S0000085	ANYWAY SHE STILL HOOKED ET UP WITH ELSIE MCWILLIAMS THE WRITER OF A FEW GREAT JIMMY RODGERS SONGS
POD1000000018_S0000086	ERNST TUB MADE A COUPLE OF RECORDS THAT DIDN'T SELL VERY WELL DID SOME TOURING AND ENDED UP BACK HOME DOING LOW PAYING RADIO AGAIN AND WORKING TWO OR THREE SIDE JOBS LIKE BEFORE DRIVING AROUND A BEER TRUCK WAS ONE OF THEM
POD1000000018_S0000088	AFTER A WHILE BACK AT HOME ERNEST HAD TO HAVE HIS TONSILS TAKEN OUT HE'D LATER SAY THAT DOCTORS TOLD HIM NOT TO SING OR YODALE FOR A WHILE AFTER THE SURGERY BUT HE DIDN'T LISTEN
POD1000000018_S0000093	ERNST HELD A SELF DEPRECATING SENSE OF HUMOR ABOUT HIS OWN VOICE FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE HE LOVED TO SAY THAT NINE OUT OF TEN GUYS SITTING IN BARS AROUND THE COUNTRY COULD SING MUCH BETTER THAN HE COULD
POD1000000018_S0000094	I DON'T KNOW IF HE REALLY BELIEVED THAT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN STRANGE TO ME I THINK GEORGE JONES INDISPUTABLY THE GREATEST COUNTRY SINGER IN HISTORY IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ADD ERNEST TUBBS NEW SINGING STYLE AND ROY ACUFF'S VOICE TOGETHER
POD1000000018_S0000096	YOU JUST HEARD SOME URGENT HERE'S A LITTLE ROY ACOFF FROM NINETEEN FORTY TWO

POD1000000018_S0000099	LEFTY BOWED FROM ERNEST AS WELL HOWEVER YOU WANT TO SAY WE GOT TO GEORGE JONES IT ALWAYS COMES BACK TO ROY ACUFF AND ERNEST TUBB
POD1000000018_S0000100	NOW THE PART OF ERNEST YOU CAN HEAR IN GEORGE IS THE TENDENCY TO HOLD ON TO A NOTE FOR LONGER THAN YOU'D EXPECT PICKING THE MELODY UP AND PUTTING IT BACK DOWN IN WAYS THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT WHEN HEARING THEM SING A SONG FOR THE FIRST TIME
POD1000000018_S0000106	IT'S POSSIBLE ERNEST REALLY DIDN'T LIKE HIS NEW VOICE ABOUT A MILLION PEOPLE DISAGREE WITH HIS OPINION HE HAD THAT TONSILECTOMY IN NINETEEN THIRTY NINE

POD1000000018_S0000116	BUDDY EMMONS JACK GREEN BILLY BIRD LEON ROADS AND CAL SMITH ARE ONLY SOME OF THE NOTABLE PLAYERS WHO JOIN THE BAND ON THEIR WAY UP THE LADDER
POD1000000018_S0000118	THIS WAS THE FIRST WAY ERNEST FOUND TO EXTEND A HELPING HAND TO YOUNGER MUSICIANS LIKE THE HAND CARRY RODGERS HAD HELD OUT TO HIM
POD1000000018_S0000123	AND SO HE STARTED CALLING THEIR NAMES OUT WHEN THEY TOOK A COURSE BUT HE WAS NEVER JEALOUS OF ANYBODY IN HIS BAND OUTSHINING HIM HE DIDN'T YOU KNOW HE DIDN'T MIND THAT AT ALL AS HE PROVED WITH JACK GREEN AND CAL SMITH

POD1000000018_S0000151	CARRY LOANED AND EVENTUALLY FLAT OUT GAVE HIM THAT GUITAR OF JIMMY'S WHICH IS WHY YOU'LL FREQUENTLY SEE PICTURES OR VIDEOS OF ERNEST TUBB PLAYING A GUITAR THAT SAYS JIMMY RODGERS ON IT
POD1000000018_S0000152	IN NINETEEN FIFTY THREE ERNEST HELPED FOUND THE JIMMY RODGERS MEMORIAL FESTIVAL IN RODGERS HOMETOWN OF MERIDIAN MISSISSIPPI THAT'S A STAND UP GUY

POD1000000018_S0000163	DENNY'S THE GUY WHO HAD TO BE CONVINCED TO LET HANK SENIOR ONTO THE OPRY AND HE'S THE GUY WHO CALLED HANK TO FIRE HIM OVER THE TELEPHONE BUT ERNEST TUBB WAS STANDING IN DENNY'S OFFICE WHEN THAT PHONE CALL WAS MADE
POD1000000018_S0000164	HE SAID HE SAW TEARS IN JIM'S EYES

POD1000000018_S0000166	THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED HANK WILLIAMS DIED FOUR MONTHS AFTER BEING DISMISSED FROM THE OPRY IT'S TRAGIC BUT YOU CAN SEE HOW JIM DENNY THOUGHT HE WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING IN THAT SITUATION

POD1000000018_S0000186	HE STARTED A BOOKING AGENCY AND SIGNED MOST OF THE OPRY ARTISTS SOME OF WHOM HAD RESIGNED WHEN DENNY WAS FIRED THEN DENNY CONTACTED THE PHILIP MORRIS TOBACCO COMPANY
POD1000000018_S0000188	SO WHEN JIM DENNY CALLED WITH A CHANCE FOR THEM TO GET THEIR PRODUCT ASSOCIATED WITH ALL THOSE ACTS PHILIP MORRIS WROTE A CHECK BIG ENOUGH TO FUND THE BIGGEST COUNTRY MUSIC PACKAGE TOUR ANYONE HAD EVER SEEN

POD1000000018_S0000194	FOR FIVE YEARS ERNEST TUBB HAD WORKED TO GROW THE JIMMY RODGERS FESTIVAL FROM SCRATCH THIS IS A TREMENDOUSLY DIFFICULT THING TO DO ET PUT IN THE EFFORT TO HONOR HIS IDOL
POD1000000018_S0000196	JIM DENNY WASN'T SIMPLY SETTING UP SHOP ACROSS THE STREET WITH SOME HEALTHY COMPETITION
POD1000000018_S0000197	HE BROUGHT A FREE SHOW TO TOWN ON THE SAME NIGHT WITH HALF THE GRAND OLE OPRY LINEUP AND SEVERAL BIG NAMES YOU WOULD HAVE HAD TO BUY A TICKET TO SEE ON THE JIMMY RODGERS EVENT THE PREVIOUS NIGHT

POD1000000018_S0000205	ACCORDING TO BILLY BIRD ERNEST TUBB'S REACTION TO THE PHILIP MORRIS COUNTRY MUSIC SHOW UNDERCUTTING THE JIMMY RODGERS MEMORIAL FESTIVAL WAS TO GET DRUNK AND STAY DRUNK FOR THE BETTER PART OF A WEEK
POD1000000018_S0000206	THEY CARTED HIM BACK TO NASHVILLE BUT HE WAS STILL DRINKING AND HE WAS STILL MAD AS HELL AT JIM DENNY

POD1000000018_S0000210	MEANWHILE WHEN JIM DENNY HAD HUNG UP THE PHONE HE SIMPLY TOOK IT BACK OFF THE HOOK AGAIN SO ERNEST COULDN'T CALL HIM ANYMORE AND THEN WENT BACK TO SLEEP
POD1000000018_S0000212	SO ERNEST TUBB IS DRUNK OFF HIS ASS WITH A LOADED GUN WHEN HE STUMBLES INTO THE LOBBY OF THE NATIONAL LIFE BUILDING WHERE WSM WAS LOCATED

POD1000000018_S0000222	EITHER WAY ERNEST SETTLED DOWN AFTER THINKING HE'D SHOT AN INNOCENT PERSON BILL WILLIAMS CALLED HIS BOSS JACK THE WHIT TO TELL HIM WHAT HAPPENED JACK TOLD BILL TO TAKE ERNEST HOME
POD1000000018_S0000225	ERNEST TUBB WENT TO JAIL FOR DRUNKEN DISORDERLY PLUS CARRYING THE WEAPON
POD1000000018_S0000227	SO ERNEST BUCKED CIGARETTES FOR ALL THE OTHER INMATES AND SANG SONGS WITH THEM WHILE BILL WILLIAMS WAITED TO TAKE HIM HOME
POD1000000018_S0000231	JIM DENNY'S NAME WAS KEPT OUT OF THE PAPERS THOUGH EVERYONE IN THE BUSINESS COULD READ BETWEEN THE LINES AND SEE WHO ERNEST HAD WANTED TO SHOOT
POD1000000018_S0000233	THE INCIDENT SEEMS TO HAVE HAD NO EFFECT ON ERNEST TUBB'S CAREER WHATSOEVER APPARENTLY IF ALL E T WAS TRYING TO DO WAS PUT A BULLET IN JIM DENNY THEN THAT WAS FINE
POD1000000018_S0000236	IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR HIS LUNGS KILLED HIM JUST LIKE HIS HERO JIMMY RODGERS

POD1000000018_S0000254	IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT HONKY TONK AND IT HAPPENED AFTER ERNEST TUBB IT WAS INFLUENCED BY ERNEST TUBB BEFORE I GET TO THE STORY IN THE EPISODE I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS ONE OTHER THING
POD1000000018_S0000255	IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTYS CLYDE MOODY TRIED TO START AN ALTERNATIVE ASSOCIATION TO THE COUNTRY MUSIC HALL OF FAME CALLED THE COUNTRY MUSIC PIONEER ASSOCIATION
POD1000000018_S0000256	THE CMPA HAD A TRASHY NEWSPAPER THAT CLYDE ESSENTIALLY USED TO RANT AGAINST THE INDUSTRY AND PRINT WHATEVER SHITTY RUMORS PEOPLE SENT IN
POD1000000018_S0000257	AMONG THESE RUMORS WAS ONE THAT ERNEST TUBB DIED BROKE AND ALONE IN A CHEAP DOWNTOWN MOTEL SHUNNED BY THE COUNTRY MUSIC WORLD HE'D DONE SO MUCH TO HELP
POD1000000018_S0000259	CHARLIE RILEY EVEN HAS IT IN HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY WHICH ISN'T THE ONLY THING CHARLIE GOT WRONG IN THAT BOOK BUT I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT ANOTHER TIME
POD1000000018_S0000260	FIRST OF ALL THE SOURCE WAS ERNEST TUBBS ESTRANGED WIFE NEXT ERNEST DIED OWNING SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE ERNEST TUBB RECORD SHOP WHICH HAD MULTIPLE LOCATIONS RUNNING AND WAS VERY PROFITABLE AT THAT TIME HE WAS NOT A BROKEN MAN
POD1000000018_S0000262	I BELIEVE ERNEST CHOSE TO TURN VISITORS AWAY BECAUSE HE WAS WASTING AWAY OF EMPHYSEMA AND DIDN'T WANT ANYONE WHO LOVED HIM TO HAVE THAT AS THEIR LAST MEMORY OF HIM
POD1000000018_S0000265	AND I THINK JUSTIN SAID THAT PEOPLE WOULD GO WOULD TRY TO SEE ERNEST AND HE WOULD TELL JUSTIN TO TELL THEM THANK YOU BUT HE'D RATHER NOT HAVE THE COMPANY
POD1000000018_S0000266	SO YOU KNOW I MEAN THE END I I DON'T THINK THAT ERNEST TUBB DIED YOU KNOW IN A SAD STATE OF AFFAIRS I THINK THAT HE DID

POD1000000022_S0000036	THAT GUY NOW THIS MAN BELIEVES BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT THAT HE IS NAPOLEON IF YOU SAT HIM DOWN AND YOU ASKED HIM CANDIDLY NO BUT WHO ARE YOU REALLY DEEP DOWN INSIDE HE WOULD SAY I'M NAPOLEON BONAPARTE COMMANDER OF THE ARMIES OF THE NORTH
POD1000000022_S0000037	HUSBAND TO A MURDERED WIFE FATHER TO A MURDERED SON AND I WILL HAVE MY VENGEANCE BUT IS THIS MAN REALLY NAPOLEON WE KNOW HE'S NOT NAPOLEON IN FACT IN A WEIRD WAY AS OUTSIDERS WE SEEM TO HAVE AN ADVANTAGE WHEN IT COMES TO KNOWING WHO HE REALLY IS
POD1000000022_S0000040	I'M GOING TO GO INTO THE SPORTING GOOD SECTION I MEAN I'M GOING TO GO UP INTO THE RAFTERS LIKE I'M TOM CRUISE AND SNAP THE DUDE'S NECK I'M GOING TO DO THIS BECAUSE THAT'S JUST THE KIND OF PERSON I AM THAT'S ME I'D SACRIFICE MY LIFE FOR THE GREATER GOOD NOW HE MAY TELL HIS FRIENDS THIS
POD1000000022_S0000044	SARTRE SAYS THAT WHEN YOU TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THE SELF IT'S NOT A SOUL IT'S NOT A PERSONALITY HIDDEN DEEP WITHIN YOU WHAT WE'RE REFERENCING WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE SELF TURNS OUT TO BE MUCH MORE COMPLEX THAN THAT WITH MANY MORE MOVING PARTS
POD1000000022_S0000045	AND I THINK A GOOD PLACE TO BEGIN IF WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND SARTRE'S VIEWS ON WHAT THE SELF REALLY IS IS TO TALK ABOUT TWO FOUNDATIONAL ASPECTS OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A HUMAN BEING THAT THE SARTRE SEEMED TO BE CONSTANTLY INTERTWINED AND DEPENDENT UPON EACH OTHER WHAT HE CALLS OUR FACTICITY
POD1000000022_S0000048	FULLY AFFIRMATIVE AND BEING FOR ITSELF AS BEING CONSCIOUSNESS OR THE SOURCE OF ALL NEGATION WELL ONE DAY WHEN SARTRE WAS TRYING TO MEET HIS MONTHLY QUOTA FOR OBSCURE SOUNDING PHILOSOPHICAL DESCRIPTIONS THE WAY HE DESCRIBES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO ONTOLOGICAL CATEGORIES IS THAT BEING IN ITSELF
POD1000000022_S0000049	IS WHAT IT IS AND BEING FOR ITSELF QUOTE IS WHAT IT IS NOT WELL AS WEIRD AS THAT SOUNDS IN A VACUUM AFTER LISTENING TO THE LAST EPISODE WE ALL KNOW WHAT HE MEANS WHEN HE SAYS IT BUT THEN SCHOLAR POINTS OUT SOMETHING VERY MYSTERIOUS A VERY STRANGE COINCIDENCE
POD1000000022_S0000050	WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO ONTOLOGICAL CATEGORIES TWO THINGS THAT ARE EASY TO WRITE OFF AS JUST THESE MEANINGLESS ABSTRACT CONCEPTS THAT START ARE COOKED UP ONE DAY WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW BEING IN ITSELF AND BEING FOR ITSELF RELATE TO EACH OTHER
POD1000000022_S0000051	SARTRE NOTICES THERE SEEMS TO BE A SIMILAR SORT OF RELATIONSHIP AT THE FOUNDATION OF WHO WE ARE AS PEOPLE SEE BECAUSE ON ONE HAND ALL OF US HAVE OUR FACTICITY AND FACTICITY IS KIND OF LIKE BEING IN ITSELF IT'S THE FULLY AFFIRMATIVE SET OF FACTS THAT ARE TRUE ABOUT US
POD1000000022_S0000053	I'M SCARED OF SPIDERS THINGS LIKE THAT RIGHT IN OTHER WORDS STATEMENTS OF FACTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY TRUE ABOUT US THAT'S WHAT MAKES UP OUR FACTICITY BUT WHAT SARTRE WOULD WANT US TO CONSIDER IS THAT WHILE THESE KINDS OF STATEMENTS ARE NO DOUBT USEFUL WHEN IT COMES TO DESCRIBING CERTAIN PIECES OF WHO I AM
POD1000000022_S0000058	YOU CAN START TO HEAR THE WEIRD START YOUR DESCRIPTION CREEPING IN THERE JUST LIKE BEING IN ITSELF IS WHAT IT IS AND BEING FOR ITSELF IS WHAT IT IS NOT IN A SENSE I AM WHAT I AM I HAVE A FACTICITY BUT I ALSO AM WHAT I AM NOT YET
POD1000000022_S0000066	WHEN SARTRE TALKS ABOUT RADICAL FREEDOM WHEN ANY OF US TALK ABOUT BEING INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE FREE TO ACT AS THEY CHOOSE WE'RE NEVER TALKING ABOUT TOTAL FREEDOM RIGHT IT'S ALWAYS FREEDOM WITHIN CERTAIN LIMITATIONS
POD1000000022_S0000072	BUT YEAH ULTIMATELY THE POINT SARTRE WAS MAKING HERE WITH THE CONCEPTS OF FACTICITY AND TRANSCENDENCE IS NOT ONLY TO STOP THINKING ABOUT YOURSELF AS THOUGH IT'S THIS ARTIFACT HIDDEN DEEP WITHIN YOU INSIDE OF A VAULT BUT ALSO STOP THINKING ABOUT WHO YOU ARE AS THOUGH IT'S THIS STATIC
POD1000000022_S0000075	UNLESS IF YOU'RE DEAD YOU'VE NEVER ARRIVED AT A DESTINATION AS A HUMAN BEING NOW AT FIRST GLANCE IT MAY SEEM LIKE SARTRE IS WRITING A SELF HELP BOOK NO NO SINGLE FACT ABOUT YOU SUMS UP WHO YOU ARE RELEASE YOUR INNER TRANSCENDENCE NO
POD1000000022_S0000076	NO LIKE WE TOUCHED ON LAST TIME SARAH THINKS THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE TRULY FACED WITH THE NUMBER OF THESE POSSIBILITIES THEY'RE FREE TO CHOOSE FROM MOST OF THE TIME THEY DON'T GET EXCITED THEY'RE HORRIFIED BY IT IN FACT MOST OF THE TIME ONCE PEOPLE REALIZE THIS STUFF
POD1000000022_S0000077	SARTRE THINKS THAT THE SECRET COVET DESIRE OF EVERYONE WHETHER THEY REALIZE IT OR NOT IS TO ESCAPE THIS DUALITY IT'S TO TURN THEMSELVES INTO EITHER PURE FACTICITY OR PURE TRANSCENDENCE OR AS SARTRE SAYS WE ALL SECRETLY WANT TO BECOME GOD
POD1000000022_S0000080	GOD IS PERFECT AS HE IS PURE FACTICITY BUT ON THE OTHER HAND GOD IS ALL POWERFUL AND CAPABLE OF BRINGING ABOUT ANY POSSIBILITY HE WANTS IN OTHER WORDS PURE TRANSCENDENCE SARTRE WOULD SAY THIS IS NO COINCIDENCE
POD1000000022_S0000083	OR PURE TRANSCENDENCE LIKE GOD IS WHAT SARTRE CALLS BAD FAITH LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE MOST FAMOUS EXAMPLE OF BAD FAITH THAT SARTRE LAYS OUT AND BECAUSE WE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT IT IN THE OTHER EPISODE I'LL KEEP IT BRIEF
POD1000000022_S0000084	SARTRE TALKS ABOUT SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF A CAFE IN PARIS WATCHING A WAITER AS HE DOES HIS JOB NOW YOU CAN IMAGINE A WAITER IN THE NINETEEN FORTYS RIGHT DRESSED UP IN HIS LITTLE OUTFIT VERY UPRIGHT GOOD POSTURE VERY PROPER
POD1000000022_S0000085	HE HOLDS THE TRAY IN A PARTICULAR WAY HE WALKS AND CHANGES DIRECTION IN A VERY MILITARISTIC PARTICULAR WAY LIKE A GOOD WAITER DOES STARTER CAN'T HELP BUT POINT OUT THAT THIS GUY DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A SELF WITH FACTICITY AND TRANSCENDENCE IN THIS MOMENT
POD1000000022_S0000087	GO TO MOST RESTAURANTS AND YOU CAN FIND SOME MODERN VERSION OF WHAT SARTRE'S TALKING ABOUT HERE I MEAN THERE'S SO MANY SERVERS OUT THERE THAT HAVE FALLEN INTO BAD FAITH AND ARE JUST SORT OF PLAYING THE ROLE OF THE SAME PERSON IT SEEMS TO BE A MODERN ARCHETYPE OF WHAT IT IS TO BE A SERVER THEY ALL SAY THE SAME STUFF
POD1000000022_S0000088	HI I'M JOHN I'M GOING TO BE TAKING CARE OF YOU TODAY CAN YOU GET YOU GUYS STARTED WITH A BOTTOMLESS BUCKET OF SHRimp OR SOME DRINKS OR SOMETHING BUT IT'S AT EVERY STAGE OF THE MEAL HOW'S EVERYTHING TASTED FOR YOU GUYS YOU ALL SAVE ROOM FOR DISHES NOW THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO RUSH I'M GOING TO LEAVE THE CHECK HERE I'M GOING TO GO OVER THERE
POD1000000022_S0000090	ASK YOURSELF IS THIS THE WAY THIS GUY TALKS TO HIS MOM IS THIS THE WAY HE TALKS TO HIS BEST FRIENDS NO HE'S FALLEN INTO BAD FAITH AND IS JUST PLAYING THE PART OF A SERVER NOW THE POINT SARTRE'S MAKING IS NOT THAT WAITERS NEED TO BE MORE CREATIVE IT'S NOT ABOUT WAITERS
POD1000000022_S0000091	SARTRE THINKS THAT AS HUMAN BEINGS WE HAVE A TENDENCY TO GRAVITATE TOWARDS THIS TRAP IN ALL ASPECTS OF OUR LIFE WE MAKE PROCLAMATIONS ABOUT WHAT WE ARE ALL THE TIME I AM A STAY AT HOME MOM THAT'S MY IDENTITY
POD1000000022_S0000094	AND WE USE BAD FAITH TO QUELL THIS FEELING OF NAUSEA WE'RE CONSTANTLY DOING THIS WITH OURSELVES NOW IF ALL YOU EVER READ WAS SARTRE'S BEING IN NAUSEA YOU MIGHT GET THE READ FROM THE BOOK THAT THIS TENDENCY WE HAVE TO GRAVITATE TOWARDS BAD FAITH
POD1000000022_S0000096	BUT IN ONE OF THE FOOTNOTES OF BEING IN NOTHINGNESS SARTRE ALLUDES TO A WAY OUT OF ALL OF IT AND PERHAPS TO AN ETHICS THAT HE'D WRITE LATER ON IN HIS LIFE WELL HE NEVER WRITES AN ETHICS UM AND IT MAY BE BECAUSE YOU KNOW HIS LIFELONG PARTNER
POD1000000022_S0000097	AND FELLOW EXISTENTIALISTS SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR PRODUCES WHAT MANY CONSIDER TO BE THE GREATEST EXISTENTIALIST APPROACH TO ETHICS CALLED THE ETHICS OF AMBIGUITY NEXT EPISODE IS PART TWO ON SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR SO WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ALL ABOUT IT UM BUT ENOUGH OF BAD FAITH LET'S GET BACK TO ANSWERING THIS QUESTION WHO AM I
POD1000000022_S0000100	SARTRE WOULD SAY YOU DON'T HAVE SOME PRIVILEGED V I P ACCESS TO THE FACTS THAT ARE TRUE ABOUT YOU AND THE POSSIBILITIES THAT YOU HAVE I MEAN HYPOTHETICALLY ANY OTHER PERSON IF THEY WERE DILIGENT ENOUGH HAS ACCESS TO YOUR FACTICITY AND TRANSCENDENCE
POD1000000022_S0000101	IN FACT JUST LIKE THE GUY THAT TELLS HIMSELF THAT HE'S NAPOLEON SOMETIMES OTHER PEOPLE ARE BETTER AT TELLING US WHO WE ARE THAN WE ARE BUT HOW HAS THIS POSSIBLE THE REASON IT'S POSSIBLE IS BECAUSE THE SELF IS NOT THE CHRISTIAN SOUL TO SARTRE
POD1000000022_S0000104	NO WE TELL OURSELVES STORIES ALL THE TIME WHAT FOLLOWS FROM THIS IS THAT THE TRUE MEASURE OF YOUR VALUES THE TRUE MEASURE OF WHO YOU ARE IS WHAT YOU ACTUALLY DO IT'S THE COLLECTION OF WHAT YOU'VE ACTUALLY DONE THUS FAR IN YOUR LIFE AND SARTRE SAYS THAT WHEN YOU STOP LOOKING AT THE SELF
POD1000000022_S0000107	THAT SARTRE LAYS OUT HIS THIRD ONTOLOGICAL CATEGORY WHAT HE CALLS BEING FOR OTHERS LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT HE MEANS SARTRE WOULD SAY THAT AN INTENSIVE PART OF WHAT IT IS TO BE YOU IS EXISTING ALONGSIDE OTHER PEOPLE AND ALL THE CONSEQUENCES THAT COME ALONG WITH THAT
POD1000000022_S0000108	THIS IS SARTRE'S CONCEPT OF BEING FOR OTHERS NOW HOW DOES BEING FOR OTHERS AFFECT MY ANSWER TO THE QUESTION WHO AM I WELL AGAIN THIS CONCEPT OF THE SELF IS OUTSIDE OF US IT'S AN ABSTRACTION
POD1000000022_S0000109	AND WHAT SARTRE POINTS OUT IS THAT THERE ARE MANY ASPECTS ABOUT WHO WE ARE THAT ARE GIVEN TO US BY OTHER PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE WHETHER WE'RE TRUSTWORTHY OR NOT WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE A TRUSTWORTHY PERSON IS AN ASPECT OF WHO YOU ARE THAT'S MEDIATED BY OTHER PEOPLE RIGHT
POD1000000022_S0000111	AND HOW OTHER PEOPLE VIEW US SEEM TO BE CONNECTED TO SARTRE BUT THE FLIP SIDE OF IT BEING THAT INTERCONNECTED IS THAT IT LEAVES US AND WHAT HE DESCRIBES AS A PERPETUAL STATE OF BEING JUDGED BY THE PEOPLE AROUND US
POD1000000022_S0000114	YOU WILL HINCESFORTH BE KNOWN AS THE WEIRD SHOES GUY IN THAT PERSON'S MIND THIS IS CONSTANTLY GOING ON BUT SARTRE'S NOT SAYING IT'S ALWAYS BAD THAT BEING AROUND OTHER PEOPLE IS SOME PARANOID EVERYBODY'S THINKING BAD THINGS ABOUT ME ALL THE TIME THING
POD1000000022_S0000115	PEOPLE VERY WELL MAY BE THINKING REALLY GOOD THINGS ABOUT YOU ALL THE TIME THE POINT THAT SARTRE WANTS TO MAKE IS THAT THIS WHOLE DYNAMIC THIS DYNAMIC OF OTHER PEOPLE SEEING YOU PUTTING YOU ON TRIAL AND TURNING YOU INTO PURE FACTICITY IN THEIR MINDS THIS IS GOING ON ALL THE TIME
POD1000000022_S0000121	IT MAY SEEM TO US LIKE WE HAVE A SORT OF SPECIAL ACCESS TO KNOWING WHO WE ARE AND THAT WE CHOOSE TO SHARE OURSELVES WITH ONLY OUR CLOSEST FRIENDS WHO WE TRUST DEARLY BUT SARTRE WOULD SAY THAT THE REASON IT SEEMS THAT WAY IS BECAUSE WHAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE IS A NARRATIVE ABOUT YOURSELF
POD1000000022_S0000124	IS BECAUSE THAT'S THE VERY CRITERIA WE ALL USE TO CHOOSE WHO OUR FRIENDS ARE GOING TO BE IS WHETHER OR NOT THEY REINFORCE THIS PICTURE THAT WE HAVE OF OURSELVES THAT'S WHAT WE LIKE ABOUT OUR FRIENDS TO SARTRE
POD1000000022_S0000125	FOR EXAMPLE IF A BIG PART OF THE WAY THAT YOU VIEW YOURSELF AND YOUR IDENTITY IS THAT YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF TO BE A SMART PERSON SARTRE WOULD PREDICT THAT MOST OF YOUR FRIENDS ARE GOING TO BE PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT SO SMART THAT TELL YOU YOU'RE SMART ALL THE TIME
POD1000000022_S0000126	OR PEOPLE THAT ASK YOU A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT YOU THEN ANSWER MAKING YOU FEEL SMART OR OTHER SMART PEOPLE THAT COMMEND YOU ON BEING SMART LIKE THEM TO SARTRE WE CHOOSE OUR FRIENDS BECAUSE THEY REINFORCE THE WAY THAT WE VIEW OURSELVES
POD1000000022_S0000128	AND OF COURSE IT'S GOING TO FEEL VALIDATING OF COURSE IT WOULD SEEM THAT YOU KNOW BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE WHO YOU ARE BUT AGAIN SARTRE WOULD SAY THAT THE TRUE MEASURE OF YOUR VALUES THE TRUE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION WHO ARE YOU

POD1000000027_S0000187	THE FIRST THING I DID WAS SAY WHO'S DONALD STERLING I HAD HEARD THE NAME I KNEW THAT DONALD STERLING WAS IMPORTANT BUT I HAD NO IDEA THAT HE OWNED THE CLIPPERS

POD1000000027_S0000209	SO MIKE WALTERS CALLED UP THE N B A THEIR NEW COMMISSIONER ADAM SILVER HAD BARELY BEEN IN OFFICE FOR THREE MONTHS

POD1000000027_S0000287	BECAUSE ON TOP OF DONALD STERLING SAYING ALL THOSE UNFORGIVABLY RACIST THINGS STERLING WAS ALSO TAKING SHOTS AT ONE OF THE MOST BELOVED FIGURES IN ALL OF BASKETBALL MAGIC JOHNSON
POD1000000027_S0000289	IT WAS AS SHOCKING AND AS BIZARRE AS ANYTHING ON THE TAPE THAT A PICTURE OF VESTIVANO AND MAGIC JOHNSON HAD SET HIM OFF TO HEAR DONALD STERLING TALK THAT WAY ABOUT MAGIC

POD1000000027_S0000309	THE TAPES DOMINATED THE NEWS CYCLE NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY WERE JUICY BUT BECAUSE DONALD STERLING WAS ARTICULATING SOMETHING DEEPER MORE SHAMEFUL

YOU1000000020_S0000219	AND THEN IN GAME TWO JACOB WAS ABLE TO SURVIVE DESPITE THE FACT THAT YELGER RAINED AN ANGER OF THE GODS THAT DESTROYED ALL OF JACOB'S CREATURES
YOU1000000020_S0000220	BUT THEN JACOB SUMMONED AN ELEPHANT SOLDIER CALLED LOXODON SMITHER THAT FINISHED THE JOB AND KILLED YELGAR IN GAME TWO SO NOW WE'RE ON TO GAME THREE
YOU1000000020_S0000221	JACOB'S GOT A VERY GOOD START BUT YELGER'S DECK IS CAPABLE OF WINNING IN AN EYE BLINK SO THE SUSPENSE IS PRETTY GOOD

YOU1000000020_S0000230	ANOTHER GREAT PERFORMANCE FROM YOUNG JACOB WILSON BUT IT WASN'T QUITE ENOUGH AGAINST THE DUTCH HALL OF FAME I KNOW THIS HAS TO BE SO DISAPPOINTING FOR HIM
YOU1000000020_S0000232	YOU'RE GRADED ON HOW MANY TOP EIGHTS YOU'VE ACHIEVED I THINK THAT ULTIMATELY JACOB IS GOING TO EMBRACE THAT FACT
YOU1000000020_S0000254	I'M HERE WITH OUR CHAMPION JACOB WILSON CONGRATULATIONS MAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH AT THE HANDSHAKE TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF HARDWARE YOU'RE NO STRANGER TO THIS
YOU1000000023_S0000002	FIRE EMBLEM IS TURNING THIRTY NEXT YEAR AND WITH SIXTEEN MAIN GAMES AND A FEW SPIN OFFS IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT IT IS GROWN INTO SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY THE GAMES ARE PACKED WITH DEEP STORYLINES AND MEMORABLE CHARACTERS LIKE MARTH
YOU1000000023_S0000003	THAT'S NOT MARTH MARTH THAT'S WHICH ONE IS MARTH
YOU1000000023_S0000005	MARTHA
YOU1000000023_S0000022	THAT WAY THE AUDIENCE COULD BE LIKE OH THAT GUY'S WEARING A TIGHT FITTING SUIT WITH A BUNCH OF WEIRD PATCHES THAT MUST BE ARLEKINA THE SERVANT CLOWN SOMETIMES TO TWO MASTERS THIS BROUGHT THE AUDIENCE IN IMMEDIATELY THEY KNEW WHAT THAT CHARACTER WAS ABOUT WITHOUT ANY EXPOSITION
YOU1000000023_S0000027	CAIN AND ABEL ARE BATTLE BROS THEY FIGHT TOGETHER BUT NOT IN THE BIBLICAL SENSE BOARD AND CORDS ARE SIMILAR EXCEPT THEY'RE USUALLY AX FIGHTERS PEGEASIST SISTERS ARE A TRIO OF FLYING HORSES LADIES
YOU1000000023_S0000028	YOU CAN'T SPLIT THESE ARCHETYPES UP INTO THEIR SOLO CHARACTERS BECAUSE THEIR BOND IS WHAT DEFINES THEM YOU CAN'T HAVE A WALL OWIGI WITHOUT A LOUISIANA AND IN THE SAME WAY YOU CAN'T HAVE A BOARD WITHOUT A CORD WHICH IS MY FAVORITE DR
YOU1000000023_S0000029	JAGANS ARE MENTORS THAT ARE STRONG AT THE BEGINNING AND THEN YOU'LL QUICKLY OUTPACE THEM AND IT'S KIND OF SAD LIKE THE FIRST TIME YOU BEAT YOUR DAD IN A BASKETBALL GAME OYAHS ARE SIMILAR TO JAGANS EXCEPT THEY'LL KEEP DUNKING ON YOU TILL YOU'RE DEAD
YOU1000000023_S0000030	WENDELLS ARE MENTORS BUT FOR MAGIC GOTO'S ARE MENTORS BUT ONLY THE LAST HALF OF THE GAME BEAVERS ARE MERCENARIES THAT YOU HAVE TO PAY ACTUAL IN GAME CURRENCY TO RECRUIT AND OGMAS ARE MERCENARIES THAT USUALLY DECIDE TO JOIN YOU OUT OF THEIR OWN VOLITION
YOU1000000023_S0000034	YOU CAN'T GET THE OTHER KIND OF LIKE IF TWO OF YOUR FRIENDS START DATING AND THEN HAVE A REALLY MESSY BREAKUP CORNELIUS IS ARE USUALLY THE PARENTAL FIGURE TO THE MAIN CHARACTER AND THEY HAVE THIS NASTY HABIT OF GETTING AXED SUPER EARLY ON IN THE GAME
YOU1000000023_S0000035	IT'S KIND OF LIKE FIRE EMBLEM DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE INTERESTING CHARACTERS WITHOUT MAKING THEM SUFFER TRAUMATIC PARENTAL DEATH
YOU1000000023_S0000049	BUT BEFORE I GET THERE I JUST WANT TO COMMEND FIRE EMBLEM FOR HAVING FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY SIX PLAYABLE CHARACTERS AND ONLY REPEATING THREE NAMES WHEN I WAS HIRED FOR MY FIRST JOB AT A CLIMBING JIM I WAS ONE OF FIVE EMPLOYEES NAMED BRIAN
YOU1000000023_S0000054	THAT TOOK LIKE THIRTY MINUTES BUT LET'S BEGIN THE HONORABLE NIGHT LIKE FIONA WHO CARES PASSIONATELY ABOUT HER PEOPLE AND WILL ALWAYS OPPOSE CRIME TO CIVILIANS
YOU1000000023_S0000055	WHICH IS WAY BETTER THAN THE LOYAL NIGHT LIKE TRUDE WHO ONLY IS LOYAL TO PERN AND WILL DO LITERALLY ANYTHING FOR HIM EVEN THOUGH PERN IS A BAD DUDE BUT I'LL GET TO THAT LATER
YOU1000000023_S0000059	BUT THAT'S NOT MY FAULT SUPER SMASH SHOULD HAVE INCLUDED MORE MAGIC BABIES AROGANCE HOT HEADS AND EDGE LORDS ALL HAVE A MEAN SIDE BUT AROGANCE LIKE VICKY JUST THINK THEY'RE THE BEST HOT HEADS LIKE CASPAR WANT TO FIGHT ANYTHING THAT MOVES
YOU1000000023_S0000060	AND EDGE LORDS LIKE NILE'S RETWEET JOKER ACCOUNTS UNIRONICALLY A LOT OF THESE CHARACTERS HAVE ROUGH CHILDHOODS BUT THEN TURN OUT CHEERFUL DESPITE THAT AND THEN THERE'S THE INFERIORITY COMPLEX ARCHETYPE WHICH I COULD HAVE JUST CALLED THE MAJORITY OF CHILDREN IN FIRE EMBLEM FATES
YOU1000000023_S0000061	PERFECTIONISTS MISCHIEF MAKERS AND FLIRTS ARE ALL HIGHLY MOTIVATED BUT SUBAKI IS MOTIVATED TO MEET HIGH EXPECTATIONS CLAUD IS MOTIVATED TO MAKE INTRICATE SCHEMES AND SILVANE IS MOTIVATED TO BE A FUCK BOY
YOU1000000023_S0000062	BUZZ KILLS ARE JUST CHARACTERS THAT AREN'T VERY FUN TO TALK TO AND FIRE EMBLEM I WILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU FOR NAMING AN UNEMOTIONAL UBER RELIGIOUS DEADBEAT DAD GILBERT IT ALSO DOESN'T HELP THAT I LOOK LIKE HANNAM IN LIGHT
YOU1000000023_S0000064	OH GOD AM I A BUZZ KILL A LOT OF THESE ARCHETYPES ARE BASED AROUND ONE SINGULAR PERSONALITY TYPE SCARLET STRAIGHTFORWARD VALENTINE'S CHILL LINHART'S LAZY SIMIA'S CLUMMY PETRA IS A SWEETIE AND RAN OFF IS A FURRY
YOU1000000023_S0000066	CHILD SOLDIER KAREN IS CANONICALLY FOURTEEN YEARS OLD
YOU1000000023_S0000069	MANUELA IS CONSTANTLY DRINKING AND FLIRTING AND JUST BEING A HOT MESS AND I LOVE HER FOR IT AND THAT MAKES HER THE PRESIDENT OF VICES
YOU1000000023_S0000070	THE VICE PRESIDENT BUT BE CAREFUL NOT TO DO THAT AROUND SOMEONE LIKE ASTRAM WHO IS CONSTANTLY ACCUSING PEOPLE OF TREASON FOR NO GOOD REASON
YOU1000000023_S0000072	HERE'S AN ARCHETYPE I CALL WHAT THE FUCK AND IT'S THE THREE CHARACTERS THAT MAKE ME SAY WHAT THE FUCK FIRE EMBLEM PEOPLE LIKE PERN WHO IS SAID TO BE A SWEET ROBIN HOOD TYPE EXCEPT HE DOES KIDNAP A YOUNG GIRL AND KEEPS HER AS HIS SLAVE
YOU1000000023_S0000073	OR THARGA WHO PRACTICES CURSES ON HER OWN DAUGHTER OR ROGER WHO IS ACTUALLY HE'S NOT ACTUALLY THAT BAD
YOU1000000023_S0000074	BUT FIRE EMBLEM DOES GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO MAKE HIS END SCREAM SAY THAT HE NEVER GETS A DATE AND HE STAYS SINGLE FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE AND IT'S LIKE WHAT THE FUCK FIRE EMBLEM YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO HIM DIRTY LIKE THAT
YOU1000000023_S0000075	THE NEXT ARCHETYPE IS CALLED ACTUALLY PRETTY INTERESTING THESE CHARACTERS ARE THREE DIMENSIONAL AND WELL DEVELOPED PEOPLE LIKE LIBRA WHO STRUGGLES WITH HIS FAITH AND HAS INCREDIBLE SELF DOUBT EVEN THOUGH HE'S DOING ALL HE CAN TO HELP THOSE AROUND HIM
YOU1000000023_S0000076	OR RICE WHO DREAMS OF BEING A SWORDFIGHTER BUT HIS WEAK CONSTITUTION WON'T ALLOW HIM TO BECOME ONE AND SO HE HELPS IN THE WAYS HE CAN BUT HIS WHOLE STORY IS ONE OF UNFULFILLED DREAMS
YOU1000000023_S0000078	AND THAT'S IT THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO INTERESTING CHARACTERS IN FIRE EMBLEM UNTIL WE GET TO RAPHAEL MY SWEET BULKY BOY WHO ONLY CARES ABOUT EATING AND TRAINING AND NOT ABOUT STUDYING
YOU1000000023_S0000094	AND THAT JUST SOUNDS LIKE A PRETTY RUN OF THE MILL AWKWARD FAMILY REUNION WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT THESE ONES ARE JUST THEIR STRANGE CHARACTERS THAT HAVE UH THAT ARE GOOD AT IF YOU INCLUDE DIMITRI IN THIS HE HAS AN IPAD

YOU1000000029_S0000053	AND THE BIG QUESTION IS WHO CONTROLS CONGRESS WHAT THE REPUBLICANS NEARLY FAVOR JERRY
YOU1000000029_S0000057	WE'VE HAD OHIO THAT IS GONE FOR CLINTON WE HAVE KENTUCKY WHICH DOES ALSO WAS A MUST WIN SO STATE TOO CLOSE TO CALL
YOU1000000029_S0000058	YOU SEE THAT THAT UM FLORIDA HAS GONE TO A PRESIDENT CLINTON IF IF DOLE IS IN TROUBLE IN THE SOUTH DO YOU SEE ANY SCENARIO BY WHICH HE COULD WIN THIS PRESIDENCY TONIGHT
YOU1000000029_S0000059	WELL JERRY IT'S AS I MENTIONED BEFORE WE WENT ON I JUST CAME OFF OF THE NINETY SIX HOUR TRIP WITH SENATOR DOLE WE SAW ENTHUSIASM EVERY PLACE WE WENT I THINK THAT CALIFORNIA IS STILL IN PLAY
YOU1000000029_S0000060	I THINK THAT UM THERE'S A LOT OF SOUTHERN STATES THAT UH WENT FOR A PRESIDENT CLINTON LAST TIME AND I CERTAINLY THINK THAT UH EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY BE A QUOTE UNDECIDED I STILL BELIEVE CONNECTICUT AND INDIANA FOR EXAMPLE WILL GO
YOU1000000029_S0000061	BUT I DON'T DISCOUNT THE IMPORTANCE OF FARADAY AND OHIO THEY'RE IMPORTANT STATES
YOU1000000029_S0000062	SO THAT SO THAT WITH ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL IF IF THIS TREND CONTINUES SENATOR DANIEL WILL SAY IN WASHINGTON OR GO BACK TO KANSAS BUT NOT BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
YOU1000000029_S0000067	MY FEELING IS THAT WE PICK UP LIKE ONE SEAT I'M SURE THAT JOHN BRO MAY HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW BUT I THINK WE PICK UP THE FOUR SOUTHERN OPEN DEMOCRAT SEATS

YOU1000000029_S0000079	BECAUSE OF WHAT HE SAYS OR SHE SAYS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE STATES IS IT'S NOT THAT CONNECTED TO THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION I THINK YOU CAN HAVE PEOPLE VOTING FOR PRESIDENT CLINTON AND PERHAPS VOTING FOR A REPUBLICAN SENATOR
YOU1000000029_S0000081	ISN'T IT TRUE THAT THE THE PROBLEM IS THAT SOME OF YOUR CANDIDATES IN THE SOUTH LIKE MARY LANDREAU AND LOUISIANA AND MAX CLELAND AND GEORGIA WERE ELECTION YEAR MODERATES THEY'VE BEEN LIBERALS ALL THEIR LIFE AND PERHAPS THE VOTERS SAW THROUGH THEM
YOU1000000029_S0000082	THEY CHARGING MARY LANDRIEU WITH BEING A LIABLE HERE'S A PERSON WHO SUPPORTS THE DEATH PENALTY SUPPORTS CARRYING CONCEALED WEAPONS IN LOUISIANA AND ALSO WILL SUPPORT A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO BALANCE THE BUDGET THAT DOESN'T SOUND VERY LIABLE
YOU1000000029_S0000088	THERE YOU GO AGAIN FALLING FOR SOME OF THE REPUBLICAN RHETORIC SHE CLEARLY HAS SAID THAT SHE WOULD HAVE VOTED JUST LIKE ME AND BENNY JOHNSON ON THAT ISSUE BUT HER OPPONENT AND OTHERS KEEP SAYING WELL THAT'S NOT HER POSITION THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID VERY CLEARLY
