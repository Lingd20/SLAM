POD1000000012_S0000185	but ken fujita who we heard from earlier who said cookie monster was a maniac
POD1000000012_S0000190	so by software ken is talking about the skills and the strategies that parents can help kids practice to improve their self regulation
POD1000000012_S0000234	just like i did with cookie monster i know it was silly and probably sounded a little ridiculous
POD1000000012_S0000258	the experiment has been repeated many many times since it was 1st done by walter mischel in the late 19 sixtys
POD1000000012_S0000263	and by hot ken fujita means intense or urgent something that you want to act on right now but he says

POD1000000016_S0000147	the civil war has been going on for about a year and abraham lincoln is worried because the war is not going well and because it is not going well he is feeling like he might have to do something drastic
POD1000000016_S0000172	and to make it even worse lincoln then tells them that it is their fault that the country is fighting a civil war at all
POD1000000016_S0000183	after everything that black americans have been through in this country that they did not immediately take up lincoln is offer and go somewhere else and start over is really an astounding testimony to their belief in the american ideals

POD1000000016_S0000248	so what is beating was not at all unusual world war 2 had done exactly what many white people had feared
POD1000000016_S0000251	would find that this actually made them a target of some of the most severe violence but what was unusual was what happened after what woodward is case was picked up by the nbc and they take him on a bit of a tour
POD1000000019_S0000021	billy swan is one genie c riley the singer of harper valley pta is the other one those are the only 2 people alive who have had their 1st single go number one country and pop

POD1000000019_S0000051	genie c riley is autobiography is really the only source i can use for this stuff and it is super sketchy to say the least
POD1000000019_S0000065	in the very next paragraph she says she would already studied the lyrics which she would have gotten from shelby why does she have shelly presenting the lyrics to her here with such promp as if for the very 1st time
POD1000000019_S0000074	if they will come by the office of shire fire his publishing company a few days later they drop in to the shire fire office and meet johnny russell who is a staff songwriter there johnny russell listens to her sing
POD1000000019_S0000075	they decide to have her go in the studio that night and the next to record a 4 song demo tape they have a photographer take some pictures of her genie thinks all of this means she is on her way to becoming a star
POD1000000019_S0000084	as they cross the city limit sign into nashville she and micky make a packet that they will always travel together as a family the baby too quote show business might chew up other folks and spit them onto the sidewalk but not us we would show them
POD1000000019_S0000090	based out of new york phil blackman is our big bad wolf uncle johnny bought a gas station right before genie and mickey moved to nashville so that is where mickey starts working
POD1000000019_S0000095	25 miles away from where genie was from she apparently thinks she can meet this lady say hey i am from texas too and get a record deal or something
POD1000000019_S0000096	she has no idea where this lady is office is supposed to be she just starts walking into publishing companies to find out if that lady works there or not when some kid asks if she is trying to get a demo tape heard genie pulls out her tape and the kid takes a listen
POD1000000019_S0000097	he seems to like it plays it for his boss who says it sounds too much like laretta lynn and they tell genie to kick rocks she goes back to her car with the baby and cries then decides to drive over to the gas station where mickey works
POD1000000019_S0000104	but jerry thinks they can get monument to back off the name change if they stay on it genie gets shown off at a dj convention introduced to everyone in town as tina stevens the next girl they are going to sign and do big things with
POD1000000019_S0000107	remember this sentence that dj paul perry sends genie is demo and a promo picture to phil blackman in new york city
POD1000000019_S0000115	then one day in black man is apartment genie is laying naked on the couch after having sex with him when she is suddenly blinded by flashes of bright light there is black man holding a camera with a strobe flash attachment
POD1000000019_S0000126	he hires genie as a secretary which is where she is working when a song writer friend asked her to sing on the demo of his new song he wants shelby singleton at plantation records to hear
POD1000000019_S0000127	i could not find a recording of genie singing it but i found the songwriter singing it himself so you can try to imagine what genie would have sounded like on the demo
POD1000000019_S0000128	clark bentley is old town drunk comes out on plantation records in 1968
POD1000000019_S0000135	she is thinking about that when perry says if genie does not take this deal then he can not represent her anymore it is not going to get any better than this she signs the papers goes home and cries about it
POD1000000019_S0000141	shelby tells genie they will use her middle initial to make her stand out more from the other genies and add an eye to her 1st name so people know it is not pronounced gene
POD1000000019_S0000142	finding out she really does not have to be ronda renae plus the fact that everyone in the room seems certain she just caught a massive hit song improves genie is mood
POD1000000019_S0000151	when she finds out she is the one paying for all of that genie and mickey do not need help spending the money they are throwing down major cash on clothing jewelry hairstyles cars all the usual rock star stuff
POD1000000019_S0000155	anyway pretty soon genie starts spending too much time with her manager paul perry one night they are sitting around holding hands and parry is talking about how careful genie has to be now that she is on top
POD1000000019_S0000159	made from her old sessions with him now that jeanie has got the biggest hit in the nation these records will sell
POD1000000019_S0000161	black man has got a manila envelope like you see in every movie about a private detective and he wants to give it to genie but 1st she has got to sign a new piece of paper saying she will not sue him for releasing her old recordings
POD1000000019_S0000170	which is also the explanation for why genie would be in las vegas opening up for johnny paycheck when all she is supposedly done is one barely released single for black rose records
POD1000000019_S0000184	something physical for genie need to play pretend with to keep the whole sarade going it was called you write the music credited to gene riley quote unquote released on little darling records in
POD1000000019_S0000188	now here are the 2 big questions i do not think i can or should even try to answer did aubrey mayhew and genie c riley have an affair
POD1000000019_S0000201	she gets to pick wild mountain berries with glen campbell on tv
POD1000000019_S0000208	if you are starting to get the idea that genie is always thought of as little more than a puppet for the people behind the scenes of her career i would say that seems accurate
POD1000000019_S0000213	and while the song is actually sung by the daughter character who does not dress that way every time you see genie c riley she looks like miss johnson
POD1000000019_S0000228	from the nightmare she describes you would expect that to be the only time she ever toked up but this video clip of ralph emery interviewing her seems to suggest otherwise
POD1000000019_S0000234	the only other woman to do that in the 1900s is dolly parton with 9 to 5 in 1981 making genie the 1st woman to ever do it if you do not count the farce with little darling records
POD1000000019_S0000252	here is her doing it on the jonny cash show
POD1000000019_S0000261	like the ely times pop critic robert hilburn who reviewed a genie c riley concert in 1971 under the headline little talent
POD1000000019_S0000268	she always had a crack band behind her the harper valley express they usually made the tempo of everything faster to really put some gas in the tank and it is impossible to deny genie is charisma as a performer
POD1000000019_S0000274	not only was genie not a one hit wonder she made good albums with very little filler check out this album track from 1972 never even released as a single called without you
POD1000000019_S0000277	without you is from genie is 2nd album on mgm after leaving plantation records in 1972 in what shelby singleton called a breach of contract
POD1000000019_S0000291	the exact opposite audience of the only reason anyone knows genie c riley is name harper valley p t a a song highly critical of hypocrisy in social groups with hardcore conservative values
POD1000000019_S0000301	next move ask tom t hall to write another harper valley pta a thing he had been very vocal about his reluctance to do but also he is a big softie
POD1000000019_S0000355	and that disclaimer is written by genie is co author who i also fail to mention is a preacher here is what he writes quote to keep from hurting some of the folks genie loves we have changed the names of several people in the book
POD1000000019_S0000374	one thing that is really interesting that we heard today is unlike as you heard in the 2nd episode of the podcast laretta lynn is recording of the pill
POD1000000019_S0000378	i think money talks i think that by the time any of those would be buzz kills started paying attention this song was already the number one pop song in america and it went number one country
POD1000000019_S0000379	every major record label in nashville had been falling all over itself for 15 years trying to do that they would have made gene c riley the mayor of nashville if she did it a 2nd time
POD1000000019_S0000387	then 2 years later in 1971 as genie stated in the book this is really aggravating for me to have to talk about right now because this is just my fault
POD1000000021_S0000006	that is trina edwards we were talking about her husband edwin edwards the former governor of louisiana
POD1000000021_S0000018	edwards served 8 years on corruption charges
POD1000000021_S0000042	there were 6 grand jury investigations during edwards is 1st term
POD1000000021_S0000046	edwards led louisiana for 8 years leaving office in march 1980
POD1000000021_S0000047	the only thing stopping him from being governor for life were term limits that edwards himself had pushed for
POD1000000021_S0000058	edwards was right to believe that 1983 election was a lock he would win it with 62% of the vote
POD1000000021_S0000061	if there is one thing louisiana governor elect edwin edwards knows it is how to have a good time even with a $40 campaign deficit starring him down
POD1000000021_S0000062	edwards chartered 2 jumbo jets announced he was going to paris and invited anyone willing to contribute $10000 to come on along
POD1000000021_S0000096	when i asked edwards about the case he did not sound all that sorry
POD1000000021_S0000111	buddy roger was a congressman from north louisiana
POD1000000021_S0000121	there would be no runoff romer would be the next governor of louisiana
POD1000000021_S0000123	but that is not how edward saw it dropping out of the race that was the 1st step in his comeback plan
POD1000000021_S0000133	in 1991 david duke was at the height of his powers
POD1000000021_S0000137	this is slow burn i am josh levine episode 5 the road to hell
POD1000000021_S0000140	that is exactly what is simply safe has spent a decade fighting against
POD1000000021_S0000148	simply safe was named best overall home security of 2020 by us news and world report
POD1000000021_S0000153	it was 1930 and the governor was huey long
POD1000000021_S0000157	long was shot and killed at the state capitol 5 years later
POD1000000021_S0000159	yes long was a corrupt dictator and sure he orchestrated a kidnapping
POD1000000021_S0000161	edwin edwards carried on huey long is tradition of economic populism
POD1000000021_S0000162	like long edwards use money snatch from big oil to build bridges and hospitals
POD1000000021_S0000167	in reality duke is brand of populism had nothing to do with shrinking government
POD1000000021_S0000169	duke is message the journalist john mcginnis wrote helped a lot of appeal for the children and grandchildren of huey long is old voters
POD1000000021_S0000172	they want to see where you are long was shot and where david duke sits
POD1000000021_S0000181	roger is big initiative was a plan to modernize the state is approach to taxation
POD1000000021_S0000184	romer was adamant that his fiscal reform plan was not a tax increase
POD1000000021_S0000187	david duke then a newly elected state legislator was one of the governor is most outspoken critics
POD1000000021_S0000197	digging louisiana is already troubled economy ever deeper in debt and forcing reform minded governor buddy roger to scrabble his way out of a new financial crisis
POD1000000021_S0000206	but strather who would helped romer win in 1987 was available to work on the governor is re election campaign
POD1000000021_S0000219	romer actually liked the rubber band idea
POD1000000021_S0000225	in his state of the state address romer apologized to the legislature for his inflexibility and insensitivity
POD1000000021_S0000228	for strather the self help stuff was bad but what happened next was worse
POD1000000021_S0000231	i saw mary matlin a whole bunch of high echelon republicans sitting around the table with but the dining room table with buddy
POD1000000021_S0000242	ideology aside romer thought the move was smart strategy
POD1000000021_S0000243	edwin edwards was going to grab votes from his left no matter what
POD1000000021_S0000244	romer figured that branding himself a republican would help stave off right wing challenges who might threaten his reelection
POD1000000021_S0000245	the statewide poll showed that the top 3 candidates are duke edwards and myself
POD1000000021_S0000250	democrats in louisiana felt burned by romer and republicans including state party officials were not sure they could trust him either
POD1000000021_S0000252	resented that romer had not included him in discussions about the party switch and romer forgetting the lessons of all i ever needed to know i learned in kindergarten cursed out and unguessed rather than trying to appease him
POD1000000021_S0000254	that endorsement would not go to buddy roemer or david duke
POD1000000021_S0000260	then duke was agging them on you know to disrupt things
POD1000000021_S0000263	buddy roemer had tried to consolidate the conservative vote
POD1000000021_S0000296	by 1991 the open primary was open in a way edwards maybe had not anticipated
POD1000000021_S0000305	duke could pass the bucket with impunity during his 1990 senate campaign because that was a federal race
POD1000000021_S0000307	hamstrung by these new rules duke held fewer rallies as a candidate for governor than when he ran for the senate and edwards is fundraising slowed to a trickle
POD1000000021_S0000312	raymond strother saw it up close during the 1987 race
POD1000000021_S0000326	the problem for roger was that a lot of swing voters felt drawn to another candidate
POD1000000021_S0000343	it was not clear based on polling how white people in louisiana were responding to duke is latest attempt at image management
POD1000000021_S0000344	susan howell had been struggling for years to get a handle on duke is voters
POD1000000021_S0000355	this became a research challenge for howell and her graduate students how could they get david duke is silent army to break its silence
POD1000000021_S0000365	romer is political consultant raymond strother heard that speculation
POD1000000021_S0000373	when i got edwards on the phone
POD1000000021_S0000378	did you or your supporters do anything to help duke get into the run off with you
POD1000000021_S0000384	the edwards campaign it turns out had a totally different secret alliance
POD1000000021_S0000391	dehemacord says the 2 of them hatched a plan
POD1000000021_S0000404	did governor edwards know about this strategy
POD1000000021_S0000407	when i asked edwards about the alliance he told me he did not know anything about it
POD1000000021_S0000408	in john mcginnis is book about the 99 campaign clyde holloway is campaign advisor brian wagner also denied making any such deal
POD1000000021_S0000421	he also thinks that edwards is totally corrupt
POD1000000021_S0000423	i am not saying it is immoral it is just amoral completely without regard to the morality of trying to help david duke get into the runoff and whether or not that would be good or bad for the state of louisiana
POD1000000021_S0000430	but what if they were wrong what if david duke won
POD1000000021_S0000446	on october 19th 1991 duke is fans gathered at the ponchatrain center in his home territory of jefferson parish
POD1000000021_S0000467	david duke was in the runoff with 32% of the vote
POD1000000021_S0000469	edwin edwards buddy romer is political consultant raymond strother knew his man was going to come in 3rd
POD1000000021_S0000475	buddy roemer finished 5 points behind david duke
POD1000000021_S0000478	and tonight the people spoke and they said buddy thanks but you did not do enough and i think that is fair
POD1000000021_S0000479	when michelle shower started working on the campaign she had been inspired by buddy roger is energy

POD1000000042_S0000243	we will see about that but we will see it probably is i mean it it it definitely passes the smell test and we know that those emails are are legitimate now right not not necessary we do not know that biden is the big guy necessarily we know those emails are legitimate
POD1000000042_S0000347	donald rumsfeld yeah
POD1000000042_S0000357	they have lost their support system which is difficult like you were saying 2 is that any kind of threat at all seems to me like something i need to be on my toes for and it is like a dog right like if you if you and jesse had a dog and you were walking it

POD1000000042_S0000598	we barely like like donald trump got beat we did not win kind of like the republicans probably should have done as well last you know last time
POD1000000042_S0000611	well how do you how do you how do you pick how do you decide like what you know how do you decide like when donald trump does something i mean you know you got to forgive him for the shit
POD1000000042_S0000622	trump was the complete opposite of that and their response was to just lose their fucking minds right now that is not always the case so let us say you are riding a train through the city
POD1000000042_S0000628	it is hard i get what you are saying but it is hard it is hard not to do that when aoc and her colleagues are talking about making lists of people who can who support trump i was not a trump supporter
POD1000000042_S0000648	no republicans are definitely going to flip the house in 2022 because that let us just be real honest about what is going to happen even if anything biden was going to push would have made some positive dent
POD1000000042_S0000658	but what i hope is is i hope if anything if anything this next 4 years like obviously they probably will not pass much they probably will not change much ah we we i think we know that but man my hope for this country is is that if he does anything
POD1000000042_S0000665	yeah but he never would have he is donald trump right so there is no he does not have that in his toolbox
POD1000000042_S0000683	which is what donald trump gave all the money to and says hey man we have it we have got the cure and it is and we are 90% right now we are going to have about 50 of those guys outs out into the world in january
POD1000000042_S0000688	let us be real about this the reason donald trump did not get reelected is not because people do not like the way he talks right because
POD1000000042_S0000727	you guys have been killing it man and it is a it is a fun show we enjoy it for danny danny holloway dakota meyer i am ross patterson we are the drinking bros good night everyone
POD1000000043_S0000009	welcome to podcast of america i am john fevero
POD1000000043_S0000080	and there were a bunch of epidemiologists scientists and others saying that fauci is timeline was way to optimistic for 12 to 18 months 11 months that is what this vaccine came out 11 months
POD1000000043_S0000084	this section is john basically being so mad at like a series of of articles in the atlantic that were so annoying over the course of many it was like the doom and gloom publication of choice for several months
POD1000000043_S0000100	failing to make any headway failing to actually stand up to trump sort of doing the morally representable and easy thing but like here is this guy fauci who i think like we will look back and say like did an extraordinary thing of serving his country
POD1000000043_S0000118	and so that is why you know that it is just it is horrible that we have to read these stories over and over again of of trump is politicizing the process when if you just shut up and stepped back and let the process work things would be better
POD1000000043_S0000150	yeah the grandpa joe
POD1000000043_S0000169	on wonka is bullshit guest worker program
POD1000000043_S0000204	i am not saying that they should do what trump seems to be attempting to do with his executive order which is you know use the dpa or use the government to say hey president all your doses are for us they are not for other countries like that is immoral
POD1000000043_S0000231	and i do not know hopefully we will figure out who did it i bet the email was just like unopened in jared is inbox somewhere with one of his you know his college roommates you know told him not to do it or something
POD1000000043_S0000252	because he cares more about private equity backed insurance company profits than regular people mcconnell is one of the worst people in political life in political history he is disgusting he is a corporate stough he is cynical
POD1000000043_S0000257	but this is this that drives me nuts is like yeah and you know why mitch mcconnell is going to get his way on this and that this deal is probably going to pass with all of the shit that he wants in it or does not want in it is because he has got the fucking numbers and he has got the donald trump in the white house like i saw you know
POD1000000043_S0000258	bernie sanders said we that the deal is bad and we should not support the deal and like i agree with him in the sense that the deal is bad the bipartisan compromise is bad
POD1000000043_S0000260	what is the what is the choice here like you are going to you are not going to negotiate a better package with these republicans who are you going to get to vote for more money you are going to get susan collins and mit romney to vote for more run and lisa murkowski no they said this is the best that they would do
POD1000000043_S0000261	and if you do not take the deal and we do not win georgia we are not going to get a better deal when joe biden is president and joe biden is not going to have a mechanism to force a better deal because mitch mcconnell is going to sit there and say fuck you i have the numbers i do not have to pass a deal
POD1000000043_S0000264	now we are trying to get to 15 now we are trying to get to one i i what i do not know is what happens if they replace the state and local aid as it was drafted with direct payments does that become something that gets people like bernie back on board
POD1000000043_S0000265	i do not know maybe maybe you try that or i mean bernie is one thing but like like josh holly or some of these republicans want direct payments yeah i would i would try to get as much in there as i could you know and i would try to push more direct payments for sure but like at the end of the day
POD1000000043_S0000301	i hate to say it guys like 0 well one obvious thing that would be helpful is winning these georgia runoffs but then you know i hate to say it but it would it would also help i think if brian kemp survived his primary challenge
POD1000000043_S0000305	because if like you know i have been saying that a lot of the concern over donald trump successfully overturning this election is is a little over hyped
POD1000000043_S0000308	but then in the 2024 election if the if the republican candidate or if it is trump pulls what trump pulled again it goes to congress and now you have a republican house

YOU1000000021_S0000004	the d n w is a continuously spinning slot machine system that confirms various bonuses effects and attacks based on the results including how zack levels up
YOU1000000021_S0000007	the game begins with zack fair soldier 2nd class of the group called soldier a private military army owned by the senior electric power company in the city of midgar
YOU1000000021_S0000009	zak has tremendous skills and talent but is unfortunately a little overconfident and reckless at times as pointed out by his fellow soldier another 1st class name sephiroth
YOU1000000021_S0000011	and giel helps him out reminding him to temper his aspirations with passionate dreams and steadfast honor
YOU1000000021_S0000012	zack hears from a fellow soldier of the mass desertion of troops in soldier and he is soon called in to speak with the director of soldier a man lying in
YOU1000000021_S0000019	suddenly angel goes missing and sephorth suspects he too has betrayed them and deserted though zak fervently denies it
YOU1000000021_S0000020	after the mission director lazar confirms angelo really is gone for unknown reasons but assigned zack on a new mission
YOU1000000021_S0000027	finding angel is mother gillian she notes zack is the restless puppy angela often spoke about and she tells him genesis came by a month ago with an army of minions and proceeded to start killing township
YOU1000000021_S0000045	as sephiroth talks more zack he elaborates more how angel genesis and himself were close friends and even though sephiroth himself was the company is prized war hero genesis whoseself wanted such prize as well
YOU1000000021_S0000048	surveying the monster sephiroth reduces the do or in league with doctor holylander which ties into the story you just told
YOU1000000021_S0000054	hollander himself appears surprised to see them but explains only he can subject genesis is degradation after which genesis himself appears and explains hollander will not be captured
YOU1000000021_S0000063	she is naturally surprised and actually likes his unique eyes to which zack continues to flirt showing off the trademark maca envied eyes of a soldier

YOU1000000021_S0000077	the experiment was twofold jilian had jenova cells injected into her while she was pregnant with jenova and genesis simply had jenova cells implanted directly into him as a test tube baby
YOU1000000021_S0000079	reason being angel can use the jenova cells as a 2 way conduit as intended angel then explains his cells can absorb genetic traits and pass it to others beyond what genesis can manage which is only imprint them onto others

YOU1000000033_S0000008	and have to make a choice today jesus says to each one of us i came that you might have life and have it to the full the question is do we want it
YOU1000000033_S0000026	when i was 20 years old in 1978 my sister convinced me to go to a conference at the university of notre dame and i always wanted to see notre dame touchdown jesus i thought i would go
YOU1000000033_S0000070	and then i got involved in the charismatic renaissance movement and then cardinal suenas asked me to move to belgium so it is not like i had a plan
YOU1000000033_S0000084	well i began with renailed ministries back in actually i i knew ralph for quite a number of years and we spoke at some conferences together and certainly had somewhat of a common mind
YOU1000000033_S0000085	and then peter came into the picture as well and the 3 of us just at different times collaborating at at a conference somewhere we began to see that we all had a kind of similar message
YOU1000000033_S0000094	how it all began i do not know for ralph mentioned this but kind of how it all began was he and i went to a hear a talk in detroit at a large conference we can not want to hear one speaker at this larger conference
YOU1000000033_S0000099	and they started praying 1st with ralph and i am just kind of watching and and it was the one of the 1st times where i saw the gift of prophecy kind of and word of knowledge working in a in a very powerful way
YOU1000000033_S0000100	and they started saying things about ralph and about his life which they could not have known that were indications of how god had worked in him and and what the lord wanted to do with him
YOU1000000033_S0000105	and so after it was all done we were driving home and saying wow what did you think of that you know and ralph said just said you know you know scripture is very clear it says did never despise prophecy but test everything and cling to what is good
YOU1000000033_S0000154	you know was like like like 2 you know of course so we we went there and after mass when he came to ralph who is next to me
YOU1000000033_S0000158	and i knew he did not want the whole 300 page answer so i said holy father i think what the spirit is saying to the church is jesus so he took my hand and he said jesus and i said jesus
YOU1000000033_S0000160	john paul the seconds are patron you know one are one of our central patron maybe of of renaissance ministries and so he is a great intercessor for us we continue to pray we ask for his help i feel his presence especially when i am on a mission internationally

YOU1000000129_S0000008	carnegie was at one point the richest american in history but he was not born in america
YOU1000000129_S0000009	andrew is story begins across the atlantic ocean in dunfermline scotland where he grew up in what could only be described as abject poverty
YOU1000000129_S0000022	carnegie would profit from it he was able to escape harm is way after paying $850 for a substitute to take his place on the battlefield it was during this time that carnegie noticed that the wooden bridges were easily burned by the troops
YOU1000000129_S0000025	owning the iron source meant that carnegie is bridge building company would not be dependent on mining or extracting companies for iron like their competitors this not only gave carnegie more control over the entire process it also improved their margins
YOU1000000129_S0000044	henry clay frick as a team carnegie and frick were a powerful force to be reckoned with and to show how ruthless the 2 could be look no farther than the story about duke cane works
YOU1000000129_S0000059	in 18989% of all steel workers industry wide would die on the job when the workers refused frick is aggressive demands for longer hours and less pay he decided to lock out all employees
YOU1000000129_S0000076	as the story goes j p morgan glanced at the offer and without hesitation accepted it morgan would buy cannegie steel for $480 making cannegie the single richest man in the world at the time
YOU1000000129_S0000077	carnegie would completely cut ties with his business life and dedicate 100% of himself to serving the world through philanthropy not a single dollar would be left to his family
YOU1000000129_S0000078	because andrew had only 5 years of schooling he had a soft spot for libraries which he credits for helping him achieve the financial success he acquired
YOU1000000129_S0000080	one example of his generosity is carnegie hall one of new york is most recognizable landmarks built in 1891 carnegie built and donated the building as the music hall
YOU1000000129_S0000085	perhaps he viewed donating his money as a way to atone for his business sins making money is a great feeling but an even better feeling is giving it away if you want to grow wealth and perhaps donate to noble causes like carnegie did
YOU1000000130_S0000011	by the time henry had become a teenager the steam engine was already making its way into the farming community coal powered threshing machines and sawmills were becoming common sight and henry was learning how they worked and how to fix them
YOU1000000130_S0000017	it is during this time that henry by chance learned about the gas engine from a british magazine it was being produced in small numbers by a german engineer nicholas
YOU1000000130_S0000018	and it was gaining some traction in europe but it was practically unheard of in america henry would get the chance to work on such an engine himself in 1889 and he instantly recognized the advantages it had
YOU1000000130_S0000020	this also allowed the gas engine to start quickly whereas steam engines of the time needed as much as 30 minutes to heat up the water and generate enough steam to start working the gas engine was an innovation henry fell in love with
YOU1000000130_S0000023	it was generating electricity for over a 1000 homes in detroit and it was doing so by using steam engines so henry was a natural hire for them whenever the engines broke henry had to fix them but whenever they were working
YOU1000000130_S0000029	he had driven a 1000 miles in henry built a 2nd quadricycle and then a 3rd one always improving the design before finally feeling confident enough in 1899 to start his own company
YOU1000000130_S0000032	and everyone was eager to see what henry could create with proper capital henry is plan was very clever since he personally knew many of the industrialists in detroit by that point he would try to build an automobile they could use in their businesses
YOU1000000130_S0000033	he leased a factory and planned to hire a 100 workers to make his new delivery wagon as he called it but it turned out that building such complex machines in high numbers was much more difficult than henry imagined
YOU1000000130_S0000041	henry labeled his 1st design as the model a and worked his way through the alphabet over the next 5 years sustained by capital from his friends and family
YOU1000000130_S0000044	the biggest game changer of all however was henry is chance visit to a slaughterhouse in chicago he saw there was something interesting a disassembly line so to speak where multiple workers would process carcasses moving down the line
YOU1000000130_S0000049	it is actually during the production of this model that henry would 1st use the assembly line process to at least partially assemble some of his cars
YOU1000000130_S0000060	they would help him transition his entire manufacturing process to use vanadium steel it was their chief engineer that built the heat treatment plant for henry in
YOU1000000130_S0000068	henry had begun a new age in american history the age of the automobile and it was his company that would totally dominate it in its 1st 2 decades
YOU1000000130_S0000069	it was not until the end of the 1920s that the rest of the auto industry caught up to henry but at that point he was already one of the richest men alive

YOU1000000131_S0000008	so they could all live together in this very confusing household john would grow up learning how to hassle people for the best deal possible and how to get the most out of every penny he got his family would rarely stay in one place for long
YOU1000000131_S0000009	and john would live this nomadic lifestyle ever since he was 3 years old to help his mother john would earn any money he could by raising turkeys or doing work for neighbors his intelligence was put to good use
YOU1000000131_S0000012	thanks to his good reputation he got a loan of $4000 which at the time was a huge sum john started trading hay grain and various meats and in his 1st year he recorded sales of half a $10
YOU1000000131_S0000019	for the byproducts of refining petroleum you see the early refineries in cleveland could only operate at about a 60% efficiency but john not only increased that percentage he also started selling all the byproducts like paraphenol
YOU1000000131_S0000025	of course not everyone would give up immediately and over time john eradicated the price of oil and carbon sometimes by as much as 80% in order to strike competitors unsurprisingly his strategy worked
YOU1000000131_S0000033	then to showcase his success john built an impressive headquarters for his company on broadway this moment was the high point of rockefeller standard oil
YOU1000000131_S0000040	and broke the company up into 34 separate entities of course john rockefeller kept his stake in those companies until his death and in fact it turns out that the breakup was the most profitable event in his life

YOU1000000139_S0000005	12 to 11 before the last game and as a world champion i had my last chance to retain the title by beating karpov in this game 24 crucial game 24 i was not rushing from the beginning i tried to play very quiet positional game
YOU1000000139_S0000011	next day when i showed up at the stage i was a couple of minutes earlier i have to say that with my coaches we have been analyzing this but we could not find any decisive ideas and then i saw karpov entering the stage
YOU1000000139_S0000030	i think that most likely anand would have resigned if i just take with a night on a 3 but suddenly i thought you know why i took with a night if i did not know the same by exchanging crowns by taking with a queen
YOU1000000139_S0000036	and it is you it cost me the victory of the final but also it is kind of a memory scarf so it is just it is something that is just it is it is a sitting there so

YOU1000000139_S0000072	and i remember that when i played rookie 7 and carpenter came back to the chesboard from his green room instantly you could feel that he senses that something has changed he did not like it so i actually we can gain even more confidence
YOU1000000139_S0000076	and the carp off made a quiet move king gian i put another rook here which is totally odd because both rooks are just standing behind the pond on the 6 but i am just fighting against his 5 and then

POD1000000004_S0000171	which according to the blue apple recipe was supposed to quote lend even more savory flavor to my dish yum
POD1000000004_S0000183	0 hanna no get your hand out of the garbage disposal
POD1000000004_S0000198	that one was not as exciting by then i understood the gimick and the excitement of discovery kind of fizzled in this way i am not too different from a lot of people who try blue aparent says professor dan mccarthy
POD1000000004_S0000206	but none of this marketing resulted in a huge new customer hall and that says forbes alex konrad made investors a little less in love with the company
POD1000000004_S0000207	it was hard to make a really attractive you know future facing story for like how blue apron really becomes that huge
POD1000000004_S0000218	still blue apple co founder and ceo matt salzberg seemed pretty upbeat about the whole situation on cnbc
POD1000000004_S0000222	one thing salzberg mentioned in that clip was how his company was tackling a huge market now if you are defining the market as all the people who eat food in america then yeah that is a huge market
POD1000000004_S0000225	that is cara rash she is a food and beverage analyst with package facts
POD1000000004_S0000227	it is hard to gauge but rasch estimates that only about one of the us population uses home delivery meal kits and she says the market kind of peaked 2 or 3 years ago
POD1000000004_S0000229	remember when we said amazon trademarked its meal kit back in 2017 rash says the company never did much with it and that is a pretty good indicator that meal kit delivery is not a growing global concern
POD1000000004_S0000232	and there were more problems within a month of the ipo co founder matt wadiak stepped down as coo matt salzberg then the ceo resigned his post shortly thereafter
POD1000000004_S0000235	welcome to trading nation i am eric chummy let us take a look at one of last year is high profile ipos that is getting absolutely smoked we are talking of course about blue apple the stock sinking as much as 4% on friday
POD1000000004_S0000239	the move raised the company is stock price but customers still were not flocking to blue aparals boxes now at this point i would have thrown in the towel but not ceo linda findley kozlowski
POD1000000004_S0000240	the company would not make kozlowski available for a chat but here she is last year on cnbc is squawk on the street talking about how jazz she is about blue aprons prospects
POD1000000004_S0000242	but also blue aparent was thinking about getting down with some strategic alternatives says market watches tonya garcia
POD1000000004_S0000246	in early 2020 blue apple put the word out that it was interested in possibly getting scooped up maybe by a big grocery chain or someone else with deep pockets who wanted to own a meal kit delivery business
POD1000000004_S0000247	at the same time garcia says the company acted like it was in turnaround mode it decided to streamline operations including shutting down its fulfillment center in texas
POD1000000004_S0000260	the pandemic seems like it is given blue aparent a decent little boost in the 2nd quarter of the company brought in 20000 more subscribers but that is still way below where they were in 2019
POD1000000004_S0000268	spectacular failures is a production of american public media it is written and hosted by me world is most finnicky eater lauren ober

POD1000000004_S0000278	why people behave the way they did during the pandemic and where we all might wind up in the difficult years to come host tim harper draws from history and social science to vividly retail the stories of great crimes accidents and disasters of the past
POD1000000010_S0000001	in this episode how to raise kind kids and to truly understand kindness anya and i visited a mother who is lived through every parent is worst nightmare
POD1000000010_S0000004	her name is scarlett lewis and before we met her coury i have to confess that i was not necessarily all that impressed with kindness as an idea i mean
POD1000000010_S0000007	but that really really changed for me when we travel to rural connecticut to spend some time with scarlett
POD1000000010_S0000010	scarlett named this place wild rose farm there are a few chickens clucking in a wire coop behind a muddy pasture where there is also a horse
POD1000000010_S0000014	we get there in time to watch her feed the animals including her constant companions 3 dogs remington rocky and olive
POD1000000010_S0000017	so scarlett leave this inside the house and i remember we took our jackets off in the mud room and hanging there was a 1st graders black and blue ski jacket
POD1000000010_S0000018	and scarlett stopped and she pulled out a pair of these funny looking teeth out of the pocket joke teeth
POD1000000010_S0000023	scarlett is son jesse had these teeth in this coat at sandy hook elementary school the day he died
POD1000000010_S0000024	my name scarlett lewis and i am the founder of the jesse lewis choose love movement
POD1000000010_S0000026	here in sandy hook connecticut in 2012 scarlett lived through every parent is nightmare
POD1000000010_S0000030	every surface is covered with painting scarlett is done and photos of jesse and his brother jt
POD1000000010_S0000031	and one of the cabinets has chockboard paint on it and on it is a message from jesse
POD1000000010_S0000033	scarlett did not notice this message until she returned to the house several days after the shooting to find clothes for jesse to wear in his casket
POD1000000010_S0000040	scarlett says she has no idea how or where her little boy came up with those 3 words
POD1000000010_S0000047	i am anna kamenetz an education reporter and the mother of 2 girls
POD1000000010_S0000048	and i am cory turner an education reporter and the father of 2 boys
POD1000000010_S0000059	so corey yes kindness is important but i guess i always assume that my kids would learn it naturally through asthma
POD1000000010_S0000061	well you know what anya you are not alone in that assumption
POD1000000010_S0000064	that is jennifer kotler she is one of our expert guides today through what turns out to be a pretty complicated subject
POD1000000010_S0000069	exhibit a is this study jen points to out of harvard a few years back
POD1000000010_S0000074	yeah and this kind of like self delusion this is just one of many reasons scarlett worries that this culture is creating huge problems
POD1000000010_S0000077	and of course her life is a really stark reminder cory of just how high the stakes can be when we talk about things like mental health and kids who are troubled
POD1000000010_S0000080	after she read that message from jesse scarlett lewis reached out to a team of researchers and educators and she created a plan to essentially teach children kindness step by step value by value
POD1000000010_S0000081	yeah the jesse lewis choose love enrichment program they estimate it is now reached over a 10 students
POD1000000010_S0000085	so let us follow scarlett is lead and sesame streets and talk about how the science of kindness can translate into action
POD1000000010_S0000095	thomas lickona says we see signs of what is called empathic distress even in tiny babies
POD1000000010_S0000098	and tom told us that baby is moral sense seems to go even deeper
POD1000000010_S0000100	so this is like i was saying cory i always thought kids are just born to be kind
POD1000000010_S0000103	only about a 3rd of the kids actually responded in that moment with altruism with kindness by say going over to the child offering a hug calling for an adult
POD1000000010_S0000104	zachary
POD1000000010_S0000106	let us try on her bella he is trying to track on you
POD1000000010_S0000109	i got a lot better
POD1000000010_S0000112	mommy how you belong
POD1000000010_S0000138	and that is why scarlett says
POD1000000010_S0000144	the jesse lewis choose love program for kids from pre k through high school actually begins with courage
POD1000000010_S0000145	and i want to mention that reports of the shooting said that jesse himself showed incredible courage
POD1000000010_S0000147	yeah and scarlett is definition of courage is even bigger than that sort of
POD1000000010_S0000154	it is also scarlett says the courage to stand up to someone who is bullying you or someone you know by taking their perspective and seeing the world through their eyes
POD1000000010_S0000160	you know hearing about courage in that way in that moment really spoke to me cory because i have to admit this
POD1000000010_S0000161	i was a little afraid to sit down with scarlett
POD1000000010_S0000165	one really practical way scarlett is choose love plan builds courage is by teaching kids to stay calm
POD1000000010_S0000170	jen kotler at sesame says if you are more aware of your emotions you will also be more aware of everyone else is
POD1000000010_S0000186	yeah before jen started at sesame workshop she spent her days in a classroom
POD1000000010_S0000190	the problem jen found out with forced apologies as that they are usually pretty worthless
POD1000000010_S0000193	yeah so tom licona and jen kotler both told us instead of focusing on kids parenting the words sorry
POD1000000010_S0000196	jen says you can actually take a moment like this
POD1000000010_S0000200	jen says sesame street has improved over time in how it depicts apologies on the show
POD1000000010_S0000202	so elmo might say i was really wanting to play with my scooter and i did not want to share it
POD1000000010_S0000206	you get it
POD1000000010_S0000207	but but wait what about your turn elmo
POD1000000010_S0000208	elmo can be patient and wait for his turn
POD1000000010_S0000209	so what do you say zoe
POD1000000010_S0000214	right nice job sharing 0
POD1000000010_S0000228	you hurt amy
POD1000000010_S0000231	tom also says that children should learn to make an apology of action
POD1000000010_S0000236	and scarlett lewis says that means when parents grew up we need to apologize too
POD1000000010_S0000240	if anything scarlett talks even more about the other side of an apology forgiveness
POD1000000010_S0000250	i love this too because scarlett is really focusing on the benefit of letting go of anger
POD1000000010_S0000252	and it was at this point we are sitting with scarlett in her kitchen her back is to a refrigerator which is covered with photos of jesse and her other son jt and we just had to ask
POD1000000010_S0000268	aja simmons helps run the social and emotional programs for schools in oakland california
POD1000000010_S0000277	tom licona says it is not just about celebrating kind actions
POD1000000010_S0000281	yeah part of how scarlett keeps going she told us is by constantly reminding herself even out loud what she is grateful for
POD1000000010_S0000285	and tom agrees
POD1000000010_S0000302	that is a great point cory i have got to try that
POD1000000010_S0000306	yeah in fact scarlett lewis says
POD1000000010_S0000308	and similarly tom says kindness as a virtue is not random it is a habit
POD1000000010_S0000313	so tom says you know not for an allowance but just to give the message that this is what we do to help out because we are part of something bigger
POD1000000010_S0000314	and for my daughter lulu who is 7 that chore really is taking care of the cat
POD1000000010_S0000322	and here is a really good news tom told us
POD1000000010_S0000327	and that is why he says we are happier when we are helping and jennette sassey agrees
POD1000000010_S0000329	and that is why scarlett says we should talk to kids directly about this helpers high
POD1000000010_S0000346	time for a recap on you
POD1000000010_S0000360	the kind of courage to see the world the way scarlett lewis does

POD1000000017_S0000009	at some point brett has to go run an arrow and i think i might have sent him on one i do not remember but he has gone so i am alone just me with the vegetables and yeah rock
POD1000000017_S0000019	steal away by robin dupree
POD1000000017_S0000031	i am hearing things like rosanna by toto
POD1000000017_S0000041	there is something jazz like in the syncopated music of something like steely dan
POD1000000017_S0000043	you can hear in somebody like michael mcdonald
POD1000000017_S0000049	and the song in which i am hearing it the deepest and strongest and most powerfully at least to me standing in that kitchen shopping those vegetables was when kenny loggins this is it comes
POD1000000017_S0000053	kenny loggins is basically sing whispering the verses of this song
POD1000000017_S0000058	and then in the pre chorus kenny loggins disappears and who shows up michael mcdonald
POD1000000017_S0000060	giving penny loggins plenty of time to gather himself
POD1000000017_S0000066	scraping the pan is the blackest thing you can do as a singer and here is kenny loggins as this white artist doing it
POD1000000017_S0000078	i am thinking about amy winehouse
POD1000000017_S0000080	i am seeing about annie lennox
POD1000000017_S0000082	thinking about george michael
POD1000000017_S0000084	i think about chris stapleton to spend my nights
POD1000000017_S0000087	and one of the many phases in which david bowie really wanted to make r and b and soul music
POD1000000017_S0000089	this is the sound not just of black america but the sound of america it is deeply american almost especially when it is sung by british people like david bowie and annie lennox and amy winehouse
POD1000000017_S0000103	and then this one will be to the landing corner you have someone like billy mccrey
POD1000000017_S0000114	it is what you would have heard passing a black person doing his job entertaining himself doing the drudgery of work the way a guy named thomas dartmouth rice did sometime around the 1830s
POD1000000017_S0000116	one day he is touring with a troop in cincinnati or maybe it was pittsburgh we do not really know but the myth basically goes ted race happened upon an old black man cleaning a horse in a stable
POD1000000017_S0000117	the man was doing his job on property owned by a white man named crow
POD1000000017_S0000122	whatever rice here is coming out of this man is mouth is captivating to him and what he sees is an opportunity
POD1000000017_S0000133	and so when tiny rice hears this black man singing this song and moving his body in this particular way ding a light bubble goes off
POD1000000017_S0000140	come listen all you gals and boys i am just from tuckahoe i am going to sing a little song my name is jim crow
POD1000000017_S0000142	and the lyrics give the horse corner a name and the name is jim crow
POD1000000017_S0000146	this is the 1st time a paying audience is basically electrified by a white man with a black face this is the night that jim crow was allocated to america this mascot of american racism
POD1000000017_S0000148	and here is thomas dartmouth rice giving it to them this is the night that american popular culture was born
POD1000000017_S0000151	so you have other ministrial acts who come along and try to do what thomas dartmouth rice is doing a song and a dance
POD1000000017_S0000175	some of those people having these dreams go on to become people like stephen foster
POD1000000017_S0000177	the man widely credited as being the father of american music
POD1000000017_S0000197	f b miller and scat man correspondent
POD1000000017_S0000210	d w griffiths the birth of a nation full of white men vilely and black face
POD1000000017_S0000220	judy garland performed in black face
POD1000000017_S0000222	bing crosby and fred astaire both performed in black face
POD1000000017_S0000227	out of these recordings you have people like muddy waters
POD1000000017_S0000237	you have the advent of a place like blue note records where lots of amazing jazz was created and then released into the world people like sidney beche
POD1000000017_S0000239	bobby armstrong
POD1000000017_S0000241	and duke ellington
POD1000000018_S0000000	when andy griffith passed away in 2012 cnn covered his death often on the entire day
POD1000000018_S0000003	larry king is one of the people who called him to talk that day he would had andy on his various shows numerous times and he mentioned something in passing that is really interesting
POD1000000018_S0000005	what larry said is that a lawyer named percy foreman was the man who inspired the character matlock
POD1000000018_S0000007	this was a weird thing for anyone to say because most people even today believe that character to be based on a different lawyer named bobby lee cook
POD1000000018_S0000009	however in 20153 years after larry king said something that most people would assume was incorrect the creator of matlock did confirm that the character was based on percy foreman
POD1000000018_S0000012	percy was able to achieve this record by being an incredible lawyer no denying it but also due to the texas court system is practice of using juries to determine guilt as well as sentencing in the case of a guilty verdict
POD1000000018_S0000016	percy had 12 average citizens from the local community sitting right there waiting to be convinced that the victim in this situation was not a victim at all
POD1000000018_S0000019	foreman called it misdemeanor murder that is where a jury might convict you of ending another person is life and send you on your way with the type of punishment you would receive for a misdemeanor crime
POD1000000018_S0000021	percy foreman had such a long run of wins with this strategy that it is still being used in texas today people who have conversations about this sort of thing will sometimes refer to it as the texas defense
POD1000000018_S0000023	now jim denny was not from texas he was from tennessee
POD1000000018_S0000025	when a 16 year old jim denney got hired to work the mailroom of wsm radio is parent company he must have seen it as an opportunity to make something out of himself
POD1000000018_S0000027	denny got this job in 1927 that year the young radio program was referred to as the grand ole opry for the 1st time on air
POD1000000018_S0000029	every time an odd job came up at the opry all the jim would take it so he could hang out backstage see the artists and see how the show was made
POD1000000018_S0000030	within 20 years denny had worked his way up to director of the artist service board at which meant he was in charge of booking the ax on the opry
POD1000000018_S0000032	there is a few funny things from jim denney is time at the grand ole opry like the one about elvis presley is big debut
POD1000000018_S0000033	elvis was still a teenager when denny did sam phillips the favor of letting elvis come on the show to play his not country arrangement of blue moon of kentucky
POD1000000018_S0000035	it did not go well denny is rumored to have told elvis backstage you you do not go in nowhere son you had to go back to drive a truck
POD1000000018_S0000037	denny is also the guy who fired hank williams over the telephone and there is the time when jim made johnny cash wait outside his office for 2 hours before letting him in to ask why cash should be allowed to play on the opry
POD1000000018_S0000039	cash mentioned that he presently had a song called i walk the line in the top 10
POD1000000018_S0000041	jim denny was what many people referred to in those times as a hard man today i think they would have some different words for him and that is why ernest tubb tried to shoot him in 1957
POD1000000018_S0000044	my name is tyler mahan co i have heard these stories my whole life
POD1000000018_S0000047	it is shocking to hear ernest tubb is name associated with any kind of violence whatsoever
POD1000000018_S0000051	crisp texas is a ghost town now ernest tubb was born there in 1914 into a family of sharecroppers like most sharecroppers children ernest grew up working on farms all over the area
POD1000000018_S0000054	like a great number of artists will learn about in future episodes it was all over for a 14 year old ernest tubb the 1st time he heard jimmy rodgers
POD1000000018_S0000058	hearing jimmy rodgers is what led ernest tubb to decide he simply had to become a country singer
POD1000000018_S0000059	it is also very specifically what caused him 3 decades later to want to shoot a 357 magnum at jim denny
POD1000000018_S0000062	the death of his idol was extremely upsetting for ernest however it also made him realize that he was going to have to get serious about chasing his dreams
POD1000000018_S0000067	holding down 3 jobs at once was necessary to support himself and his young wife elaine they did not waste any time before starting to have kids either
POD1000000018_S0000069	ernest was more than happy to work hard if it kept him moving towards the life of his hero jimmy rodgers
POD1000000018_S0000070	he would had this small picture of jimmy for years now and it was in pretty bad shape so he got a phone book and looked up the number for jimmy rodger is widow
POD1000000018_S0000071	he called her on the phone to explain that he was such a big fan and to see if she happened to have a bigger better photo of jimmy that ernest could have maybe even one that was autographed
POD1000000018_S0000072	karry was super nice and she did have such a photo that ernest is could have and went so far as to invite him out to her house in carriville texas to get the picture
POD1000000018_S0000073	ernest drove out there the next sunday he was not working taking elaine and their baby justin on the trip
POD1000000018_S0000075	they would planned to stay for maybe 10 minutes and ended up hanging out for over 2 hours looking at costumes guitars and pictures brought out by missus rogers hearing her stories about how high on the hog they would lived merely a few years earlier
POD1000000018_S0000076	et could never have guessed when he woke up that morning that he would be laying down to sleep that night having held jimmy rodgers signature martin acoustic guitar with jimmy is name inlaid in perl across the fretboard and the word thanks written on the back upside down
POD1000000018_S0000080	okay now add this on top of that a few months later carrie rodgers called ernest to say she would listened for his radio show as he would asked for her to do
POD1000000018_S0000082	on the other hand she did not think he sounded like jimmy rodgers when he sang which is basically the only thing in the world ernest tubb wanted to do in this phase of his life
POD1000000018_S0000085	anyway she still hooked et up with elsie mcwilliams the writer of a few great jimmy rodgers songs
POD1000000018_S0000086	ernest tubb made a couple of records that did not sell very well did some touring and ended up back home doing low paying radio again and working 2 or 3 side jobs like before driving around a beer truck was one of them
POD1000000018_S0000088	after a while back at home ernest had to have his tonsils taken out he would later say the doctors told him not to sing or yodle for a while after the surgery but he did not listen
POD1000000018_S0000093	ernest held a self deprecating sense of humor about his own voice for the rest of his life he loved to say that 9 out of 10 guys sitting in bars around the country could sing much better than he could
POD1000000018_S0000094	i do not know if he really believed that it is always been strange to me i think george jones indisputably the greatest country singer in history is exactly what happens when you add ernest tubbs new singing style and roy acuff is voice together
POD1000000018_S0000096	you just heard some earnest here is a little roy acuff from 1942
POD1000000018_S0000098	now george jones would have told you hank williams was his favorite singer you do not get hank without ernest and roy i have seen lefty frizzell named as an influence on george
POD1000000018_S0000099	lefty bowed from ernest as well however you want to say we got to george jones it always comes back to roy acuff and ernest tubb
POD1000000018_S0000100	now the part of ernest you can hear in george is the tendency to hold on to a note for longer than you would expect picking the melody up and putting it back down in ways that are impossible to predict when hearing them sing a song for the 1st time
POD1000000018_S0000106	it is possible ernest really did not like his new voice about a 10 people disagree with his opinion he had that tonsilectomy in 1939
POD1000000018_S0000107	in 1940 he had his biggest hit walk in the floor over you this song is still synonymous with the name ernest tubb
POD1000000018_S0000108	if someone only knows one ernest tubb song it is usually this song
POD1000000018_S0000111	the texas tubb ernest tubb
POD1000000018_S0000115	tupp would stay working for the rest of his life so members of the texas tubadours would be replaced every now and then
POD1000000018_S0000116	buddy emmons jack green billy bird leon rhodes and cal smith are only some of the notable players who join the band on their way up the ladder
POD1000000018_S0000118	this was the 1st way ernest found to extend a helping hand to younger musicians like the hand carry rodgers had held out to him
POD1000000018_S0000123	and so he started calling their names out when they took a course but he was never jealous of anybody in his band outshining him he did not you know he did not mind that at all as he proved with jack green and cal smith
POD1000000018_S0000124	and of course he had the wilburg with him for a while and skeeter worked and dates with him george jones stonewall jackson and he was always pushing them and he like roy i think understood that the bigger they became the bigger he became
POD1000000018_S0000125	george jones and stonewall jackson were never texas troubadours justin ment et took those guys out on tour with him as opening acts to help them build their own following and often he did a lot more than that
POD1000000018_S0000127	johnny paycheck
POD1000000018_S0000129	ernest one time i was hanging around the streets and it was snowing and the buddy emmons took me on the meeting and i always wanted to meet him
POD1000000018_S0000131	and inevitably butty had told him that
POD1000000018_S0000138	you can not tell the hank snow story without talking about ernest tubb et told johnny cash not to smile when he performed folsom prison blues so people in the audience could really feel the song
POD1000000018_S0000139	cash never forgot the advice hank williams senior was heavily influenced by ernest music and ernest is the one who convinced the grand ole opry to bring hank back after his 1st failed audition
POD1000000018_S0000140	et got hank to promise he would not touch any booze for 3 months to swing that one
POD1000000018_S0000141	in 1947 enough radio listeners wrote letters complaining of not being able to find his music that he launched the ernest tubb record shop in nashville if you could not make it there in person they would ship records directly to you
POD1000000018_S0000144	the record shop operated at a loss of $10000 a year for the 1st 2 years it was open but ernest knew how important it was and he kept it alive
POD1000000018_S0000147	ernest played host to opry stars and newcomers alike making sure to remind you this music was available for mail order from ernest tubbs record shop he took the chance to keep jimmy rodgers memory alive pitching his records as well
POD1000000018_S0000149	ernest never grew out of his fascination with jimmy rogers and never stopped repaying his debt to jimmy is widow carrie jimmy is death had left carrie in a pretty bad financial situation but she still got money from the sales of his records which were declining
POD1000000018_S0000150	he realized the more jimmy rodgers records sold the better off carrier would be so e t pushed those records as hard as he could
POD1000000018_S0000151	carry loaned and eventually flat out gave him that guitar of jimmy is which is why you will frequently see pictures or videos of ernest tubb playing a guitar that says jimmy rogers on it
POD1000000018_S0000152	in 1953 ernest helped found the jimmy rodgers memorial festival in rodgers hometown of meridian mississippi that is a stand up guy
POD1000000018_S0000154	you can find plenty of people who will say the same thing about jim denny
POD1000000018_S0000155	remember jim poor kid from tennessee worked his way up from the mailroom to become director of artist services at wsm and manager of the grand ole opry
POD1000000018_S0000157	denny was a powerful man in nashville and he acted like he knew it
POD1000000018_S0000158	where ernest tubb built a reputation for helping young musicians jim denny had a reputation for acting like a dick
POD1000000018_S0000160	the johnny cash et gave advice to is the same johnny cash who had to wait 2 hours outside denny is office
POD1000000018_S0000162	jim denny might not have been a dick he could have simply been a businessman who paid more attention to the bottom line than how many friends he had
POD1000000018_S0000163	denny is the guy who had to be convinced to let hank senior onto the opry and he is the guy who called hank to fire him over the telephone but ernest tubb was standing in denny is office when that phone call was made
POD1000000018_S0000164	he said he saw tears in jim is eyes
POD1000000018_S0000165	hank had missed a scheduled opry appearance most likely for no good reason other than that he was drunk denny said he thought firing hank would make him realize he needed to get his act together
POD1000000018_S0000166	that is not what happened hank williams died 4 months after being dismissed from the opry it is tragic but you can see how jim denny thought he was doing the right thing in that situation
POD1000000018_S0000167	this is important to recognize because the year hank williams died is the same year that jim denny form cedar wood publishing with web pierce
POD1000000018_S0000172	roy acuff and fred rose had started acuff rose music back in 1942
POD1000000018_S0000174	they were the best game in town until jim denny formed cedarwood in 53
POD1000000018_S0000175	as head of artist services at wsm and manager of the grand ole opry jim denny controlled who got to play in the opry their place in the lineup and how long they got to play
POD1000000018_S0000178	if jim denny owns a country music publishing firm while retaining singular control of the most popular country music radio program in america then he is essentially printing his own money
POD1000000018_S0000181	if the writer does not want to be a performer congratulations web pierce is the biggest star on the opry and he is playing your song on the grand ole opry tonight
POD1000000018_S0000182	roy acuff was pissed off and he did not stay quiet about it he said denny was giving the best spots to his own artists artists signed to acuff rose had a tendency to see roy is point
POD1000000018_S0000183	artists signed 2 cedar wood had a tendency to think jim denny was not doing anything wrong weird huh
POD1000000018_S0000184	long story short in 1956 wsm fired jim denny over his conflicts of interest
POD1000000018_S0000186	he started a booking agency and signed most of the opry artists some of whom had resigned when denny was fired then denny contacted the philip morris tobacco company
POD1000000018_S0000188	so when jim denny called with a chance for them to get their product associated with all those acts philip morris wrote a check big enough to fund the biggest country music package tour anyone had ever seen
POD1000000018_S0000191	it looked as though everyone was getting what they wanted until the philip moore is country music show booked a stop in meridian mississippi on the same week as the 5th annual jimmy rodgers memorial festival
POD1000000018_S0000194	for 5 years ernest tubb had worked to grow the jimmy roger is festival from scratch this is a tremendously difficult thing to do et put in the effort to honor his idol
POD1000000018_S0000196	jim denny was not simply setting up shop across the street with some healthy competition
POD1000000018_S0000197	he brought a free show to town on the same night with half the grand ole opry lineup and several big names you would have had to buy a ticket to see on the jimmy rodgers event the previous night
POD1000000018_S0000199	it would crush bonaire this was such a big deal that they did not even have the jimmy rodgers memorial festival the following year
POD1000000018_S0000200	they regrouped to put one on again in 1959 but carrie rodgers health had already taken a turn for the worse and ernest tubb was never involved with the festival again
POD1000000018_S0000205	according to billy bird ernest tubbs reaction to the philip moss country music show undercutting the jimmy rodgers memorial festival was to get drunk and stay drunk for the better part of a week
POD1000000018_S0000206	they carted him back to nashville but he was still drinking and he was still mad as hell at jim denny
POD1000000018_S0000207	finally he called denny at home in the middle of the night to cuss him out denny said something like well if you are so mad about it then how about you just meet me down at wsm right now and we will settle things for good
POD1000000018_S0000209	that sounded like a great plan to earn his tubb he strapped on a gun belt with bullets and a 357 magnum in the holster and drove downtown in his cadillac wearing house slippers
POD1000000018_S0000210	meanwhile when jim denny had hung up the phone he simply took it back off the hook again so ernest could not call him anymore and then went back to sleep
POD1000000018_S0000212	so ernest tubb is drunk off his ass with a loaded gun when he stumbles into the lobby of the national life building where wsm was located
POD1000000018_S0000217	bill williams the news director at w s m says he was walking into work when a gun shot rang out in the lobby and a bullet went over his head into the wall
POD1000000018_S0000218	he turned around you know pretty scared and saw ernest is tube standing there in his house slippers with a revolver
POD1000000018_S0000220	when he asked ernest what the hell he was doing ernest said my god i have shot the wrong man
POD1000000018_S0000221	whether or not he had been actively trying to kill anyone we will never know for certain it seems to me like he thought he had successfully shot someone and was only upset that someone was not jim denny
POD1000000018_S0000222	either way ernest settled down after thinking he would shot an innocent person bill williams called his boss jack the whit to tell him what happened jack told bill to take ernest home
POD1000000018_S0000225	ernest tubb went to jail for drunken disorderly plus carrying the weapon
POD1000000018_S0000227	so ernest bought cigarettes for all the other inmates and sang songs with them while bill williams waited to take him home
POD1000000018_S0000231	jim denny is name was kept out of the papers though everyone in the business could read between the lines and see who ernest had wanted to shoot
POD1000000018_S0000233	the incident seems to have had no effect on ernest tubbs career whatsoever apparently if all e t was trying to do was put a bullet in jim denny then that was fine
POD1000000018_S0000236	in 1984 his lungs killed him just like his hero jimmy rodgers
POD1000000018_S0000238	the midnight jamboree still airs every saturday night and you can still buy music from ernest tubbs record shop or online at et record shop dot com
POD1000000018_S0000240	we are told that in 1963 ernest tubb made up with jim denny before jim passed away from cancer the jim denny artist bureau stayed in business for only a few more years
POD1000000018_S0000242	jim denny was inducted to the country music hall of fame in 1966 cedarwood jim denny is publishing company was sold to mel tillis in 1983
POD1000000018_S0000243	ernest tubb had been inducted to the country music hall of fame in 1965 while he was still alive
POD1000000018_S0000247	be nice every episode of cocaine and rye stones is written and produced by me tyler mahan co
POD1000000018_S0000252	okay 1st of all if i did not make it clear it is impossible to overstate ernest tubbs importance to country music
POD1000000018_S0000254	if you want to call it honky tonk and it happened after ernest tubb it was influenced by ernest tubb before i get to the story in the episode i would like to address one other thing
POD1000000018_S0000255	in the 19 eightys clyde moody tried to start an alternative association to the country music hall of fame called the country music pioneer association
POD1000000018_S0000256	the cmpa had a trashy newspaper that clyde essentially used to rant against the industry and print whatever shitty rumors people sent in
POD1000000018_S0000257	among these rumors was one that ernest tubb died broke and alone in a cheap downtown motel shunned by the country music world he had done so much to help
POD1000000018_S0000259	charlie louvin even has it in his autobiography which is not the only thing charlie got wrong in that book but i will talk about that another time
POD1000000018_S0000260	1st of all the source was ernest tubb is angry wife next ernest died owning 70% of the ernest tubb record shop which had multiple locations running and was very profitable at that time he was not a broken man
POD1000000018_S0000262	i believe ernest chose to turn visitors away because he was wasting away of emphysema and did not want anyone who loved him to have that as their last memory of him
POD1000000018_S0000265	and i think justin said that people would go would try to see ernest and he would tell justin to tell them thank you but he would rather not have the company
POD1000000018_S0000266	so you know i mean the end i i do not think that ernest tubb died you know in a sad state of affairs i think that he did
POD1000000018_S0000268	i think he did a lot for country music and i think he went out the way that he wanted to go it seems like to me okay back to ernest tubb and jim denny
POD1000000018_S0000269	what about this story right is was that crazy it is just so many things like the the roots of country music are just growing all over this story you know you got jim denny showing up right as the grand ole opry is becoming a thing
POD1000000018_S0000270	ernest tubb gets in there and his throat is broken so he can not do what he wanted to do his whole life which is imitate his hero
POD1000000018_S0000271	and then his throat gets broken and so now he has got to create this new thing and he ends up influencing a fucking hank williams senior and like everyone that is that is crazy it is amazing i love this story
POD1000000018_S0000273	at least the part about ernest tubb getting drunk and going down to the radio station with a gun and shooting and firing off around into the wall you know
POD1000000018_S0000274	people always bring that up as an example of how wild and crazy these old guys were everybody laughs about ernest getting haulled off to jail and ultimately getting away with causing a little bit of trouble you know 0 boys will be boys
POD1000000018_S0000276	thanks to ronnie pue is very well done biography on ernest tubb the that finally had this story for me and the big jimmy roger is festival thing why that affected ernest so deeply that was in
POD1000000018_S0000277	the most detailed account of bill williams version of the lobby shooting was in there
POD1000000018_S0000278	i went with bill is version because a he was the news director of w s m with a reputation for being able to throw away that day is news script and add lib the news without making a mistake
POD1000000018_S0000279	and b he was the one right in the middle of it you know he called his boss at home he went with ernest to the jail ah shout out jim farney everyone else just seemed like a bystander trying to get their name involved you know
POD1000000018_S0000280	like a security guard saying that he told ernest to put the gun away and ernest fired it off to dare the security guard or whatever you know i mean
POD1000000018_S0000282	also i am aware there are you know different revisionist history type opinions about how well elvis presley is debut on the grand ole opry did or did not go
POD1000000018_S0000285	i have seen every year from 1924 to 1929 sided as the year of danny being hired at the parent company of w s m the insurance company the life insurance company i do not really care what year he you know exactly was let us see

POD1000000018_S0000287	lyric jordan is biography on jim reeves had a bunch of great information on the jim dandy opry scandal i found a billboard magazine from 1956 reporting that billy more has paid over $40 for the talent on that 1st package tour

POD1000000018_S0000294	i know i am going to keep coming back to this book for future episodes a lot of what i got out of that for this was about denny is firing because pretty much everywhere else you hear people talk about denny getting fired
POD1000000018_S0000295	they are all like yeah i do not know it was just like weird no one really knows why he got fired or you have got artists who were with cedarwood saying jim danny got railroaded
POD1000000018_S0000296	you have got artists who were with accof rose saying danny was corrupted and he had to get out of there you know so this wsm book was really good just to find out straight up what happened
POD1000000018_S0000298	i mentioned that hank senior was heavily influenced by ernest tubb but also some of the most charming stuff i have ever read about hank is the way he acted around ernest
POD1000000018_S0000299	you know they were contemporaries hank was influenced by him but then he you know got to come to the show
POD1000000018_S0000300	and be a part of the big time and he you just get the idea that he was just like a kid in a candy store around ernest tubb you get the the idea that he just really loved being around this guy and he could not help messing with him he was always screwing with ernest

POD1000000018_S0000311	like jack ruby asked percy foreman to defend him after shooting lee harvey oswald but then there was this communication error like
POD1000000018_S0000312	jack ruby is people told jack that forman wanted like 5 times as much money as he could ever ask from anyone or something so he was like well scruew that i got someone else
POD1000000018_S0000313	and and forman like seemed disappointed that he did not get that case so i guess he wanted that but forman did represent martin luther king junior is assassin james earl ray
POD1000000018_S0000314	but only long enough to convince him to plead guilty so yeah james did not get away with that
POD1000000018_S0000321	it was only after uncovering the percy forman matlock connection that i learned that it was really just a legal defense strategy that works so incredibly well there it may as well be a law
POD1000000018_S0000326	then next week i am going to be talking about laretta lynn song the pill it is about the birth control pill and it was banned from radio and i was looking into why and i found out a lot of really really interesting stuff you know

POD1000000022_S0000001	apologies for the voice and my lack of execution today i am just getting over a cold but it had been too long since i would grazed you with my voice and i wanted to give you guys this today is episode is part 6 in a series on sartre and camus i hope you love the show today
POD1000000022_S0000004	maybe you do not sit around poised waiting to make other people aware of some bad thing that happened in the past well enough of that crazy talk get off the bench because your uncle steve is putting you in the game i am here to tell you do not worry my friend you are a victim you really are
POD1000000022_S0000012	and at the time as sartre for over 300 years people have been pointing out how many of the ways we look at things in the western world are largely derivative from the way christianity describes being a human being
POD1000000022_S0000023	that a reasonable expectation to have when navigating your life is that one day you are going to wake up and there is going to be some event some miracle that you witness some transcendent moment where you realize the divinity of jesus
POD1000000022_S0000030	maybe for some of you out there there is only one other person in this entire world that has full access to your true self hidden deep within you but sartre would say is this really how the self works
POD1000000022_S0000031	is the self really like the christian soul hidden somewhere deep within you that only you have access to scholar would say it very well may be that you put on a mask when you go out in public for the sake of pragmatism and it very well may be that you have reflected on yourself
POD1000000022_S0000033	this concept is a common one in existentialism it is actually one of the main themes in dostoyevsky is book crime and punishments the idea that you know we often think we know a lot more about ourselves and we actually do in practice 2 examples of this
POD1000000022_S0000036	that guy now this man believes beyond a shadow of a doubt that he is napoleon if you sat him down and you asked him candidly no but who are you really deep down inside he would say i am napoleon bonaparte commander of the armies of the north
POD1000000022_S0000037	husband to a murdered wife father to a murdered son and i will have my vengeance but is this man really napoleon we know he is not napoleon in fact in a weird way as outsiders we seem to have an advantage when it comes to knowing who he really is
POD1000000022_S0000040	i am going to the sporting good section i mean i am going to go up into the rafters like i am tom cruise and snap the dude is neck i am going to do this because that is just the kind of person i am that is me i would sacrifice my life for the greater good now he may tell his friends this
POD1000000022_S0000044	sartre says that when you take a closer look at the self it is not a soul it is not a personality hidden deep within you what we are referencing when we talk about the self turns out to be much more complex than that with many more moving parts
POD1000000022_S0000045	and i think a good place to begin if we want to understand sartre is views on what the self really is is to talk about 2 foundational aspects of what it means to be a human being that the sartre seemed to be constantly intertwined and dependent upon each other what he calls our facticity
POD1000000022_S0000048	fully affirmative and being for itself as being consciousness or the source of all negation well one day when sartre was trying to meet his monthly quota for obscure sounding philosophical descriptions the way he describes the relationship between these 2 ontological categories is that being in itself
POD1000000022_S0000049	is what it is and being for itself quote is what it is not well as weird that sounds in a vacuum after listening to the last episode we all know what he means when he says it but then scholar points out something very mysterious a very strange coincidence
POD1000000022_S0000050	when you look at the relationship between these 2 ontological categories 2 things that are easy to write off as just these meaningless abstract concepts that start are cooked up one day when you look at how being in itself and being for itself relate to each other
POD1000000022_S0000051	sartre notices there seems to be a similar sort of relationship at the foundation of who we are as people see because on one hand all of us have our facticity and facticity is kind of like being in itself it is the fully affirmative set of facts that are true about us
POD1000000022_S0000053	i am scared of spiders things like that right in other words statements of facts that are currently true about us that is what makes up our facticity but what sartre would want us to consider is that while these kinds of statements are no doubt useful when it comes to describing certain pieces of who i am
POD1000000022_S0000058	you can start to hear the weird start your description creeping in there just like being in itself is what it is and being for itself is what it is not in a sense i am what i am i have a facticity but i also am what i am not yet
POD1000000022_S0000066	when sartre talks about radical freedom when any of us talk about being individuals that are free to act as they choose we are never talking about total freedom right it is always freedom within certain limitations
POD1000000022_S0000072	but yeah ultimately the point sartre was making here with the concepts of facticity and transcendence is not only to stop thinking about yourself as though it is this artifact hidden deep within you inside of a vault but also stop thinking about who you are as though it is this static
POD1000000022_S0000075	unless if you are dead you have never arrived at a destination as a human being now at 1st glance it may seem like sartre is writing a self help book no no single fact about you sums up who you are release your inner transcendence no
POD1000000022_S0000076	no like we touched on last time sartre thinks that when people are truly faced with the number of these possibilities they are free to choose from most of the time they do not get excited they are horrified by it in fact most of the time once people realize this stuff
POD1000000022_S0000077	sartre thinks that the secret covet desire of everyone whether they realize it or not is to escape this duality it is to turn themselves into either pure facticity or pure transcendence or as sartre says we all secretly want to become god
POD1000000022_S0000080	god is perfect as he is pure facticity but on the other hand god is all powerful and capable of bringing about any possibility he wants in other words pure transcendence sartre would say this is no coincidence
POD1000000022_S0000083	or pure transcendence like god is what sartre calls bad faith let us take a look at the most famous example of bad faith that sartre lays out and because we already talked about it in the other episode i will keep it brief
POD1000000022_S0000084	sartre talks about sitting in the middle of a cafe in paris watching a waiter as he does his job now you can imagine a waiter in the 19 fortys right dressed up in his little outfit very upright good posture very proper
POD1000000022_S0000085	he holds the tray in a particular way he walks and changes direction in a very militaristic particular way like a good waiter does sartre can not help but point out that this guy does not seem to be a self with facticity and transcendence in this moment
POD1000000022_S0000087	go to most restaurants and you can find some modern version of what sartre is talking about here i mean there is so many servers out there that have fallen into bad faith and are just sort of playing the role of the same person it seems to be a modern archetype of what it is to be a server they all say the same stuff
POD1000000022_S0000088	hi i am john i am going to be taking care of you today can you get you guys started with a bottomless bucket of shrimp or some drinks or something but it is at every stage of the meal how is everything tasted for you guys you all save room for dishes now there is absolutely no rush i am going to leave the check here i am going to go over there
POD1000000022_S0000090	ask yourself is this the way this guy talks to his mom is this the way he talks to his best friends no he is fallen into bad faith and is just playing the part of a server now the point sartre is making is not that waiters need to be more creative it is not about waiters
POD1000000022_S0000091	sartre thinks that as human beings we have a tendency to gravitate towards this trap in all aspects of our life we make proclamations about what we are all the time i am a stay at home mom that is my identity
POD1000000022_S0000094	and we use bad faith to quell this feeling of nausea we are constantly doing this with ourselves now if all you ever read was sartre is being in nausea you might get the read from the book that this tendency we have to gravitate towards bad faith
POD1000000022_S0000096	but in one of the footnotes of being in nothingness sartre alludes to a way out of all of it and perhaps to an ethics that he would write later on in his life well he never writes an ethics and it may be because you know his lifelong partner
POD1000000022_S0000097	and fellow existentialist simone de beauvoir produces what many consider to be the greatest existentialist approach to ethics called the ethics of ambiguity next episode is part 2 on simone de beauvoir so we are going to be talking all about it but enough of bad faith let us get back to answering this question who am i
POD1000000022_S0000100	sartre would say you do not have some privileged v i p access to the facts that are true about you and the possibilities that you have i mean hypothetically any other person if they were diligent enough has access to your facticity and transcendence
POD1000000022_S0000101	in fact just like the guy that tells himself that he is napoleon sometimes other people are better at telling us who we are than we are but how has this possible the reason it is possible is because the self is not the christian soul to sartre
POD1000000022_S0000104	no we tell ourselves stories all the time what follows from this is that the true measure of your values the true measure of who you are is what you actually do it is the collection of what you have actually done thus far in your life and sartre says that when you stop looking at the self
POD1000000022_S0000107	that sartre lays out his 3rd ontological category what he calls being for others let us talk about what he means sartre would say that an intensive part of what it is to be you is existing alongside other people and all the consequences that come along with that
POD1000000022_S0000108	this is sartre is concept of being for others now how does being for others affect my answer to the question who am i well again this concept of the self is outside of us it is an abstraction
POD1000000022_S0000109	and what sartre points out is that there are many aspects about who we are that are given to us by other people for example whether we are trustworthy or not whether or not you are a trustworthy person is an aspect of who you are that is mediated by other people right
POD1000000022_S0000111	and how other people view us seem to be connected to sartre but the flip side of it being that interconnected is that it leaves us and what he describes as a perpetual state of being judged by the people around us
POD1000000022_S0000114	you will hincesforth be known as the weird shoes guy in that person is mind this is constantly going on but sartre is not saying it is always bad that being around other people is some paranoid everybody is thinking bad things about me all the time thing
POD1000000022_S0000115	people very well may be thinking really good things about you all the time the point that sartre wants to make is that this whole dynamic this dynamic of other people seeing you putting you on trial and turning you into pure facticity in their minds this is going on all the time
POD1000000022_S0000121	it may seem to us like we have a sort of special access to knowing who we are and that we choose to share ourselves with only our closest friends who we trust dearly but sartre would say that the reason it seems that way is because what you actually have is a narrative about yourself
POD1000000022_S0000124	is because that is the very criteria we all use to choose who our friends are going to be is whether or not they reinforce this picture that we have of ourselves that is what we like about our friends to sartre
POD1000000022_S0000125	for example if a big part of the way that you view yourself and your identity is that you consider yourself to be a smart person sartre would predict that most of your friends are going to be people that are not so smart that tell you you are smart all the time
POD1000000022_S0000126	or people that ask you a lot of questions that you then answer making you feel smart or other smart people that commend you on being smart like them to sartre we choose our friends because they reinforce the way that we view ourselves
POD1000000022_S0000128	and of course it is going to feel validating of course it would seem that you know better than anyone else who you are but again sartre would say that the true measure of your values the true answer to the question who are you
POD1000000025_S0000006	i am david diggs
POD1000000025_S0000007	i am raphael casal
POD1000000025_S0000010	it is a little hard to summarize the partnership between david and raphael because as best friends and creative collaborators they have done so much over the years together
POD1000000025_S0000011	let me start individually david diggs won a tony and a grammy 1st performance in hamilton
POD1000000025_S0000012	he played thomas jefferson and the marquis de lafayette in the original broadway cast

POD1000000025_S0000019	their story begins at berkeley high school here is to defeat
POD1000000025_S0000024	my memory of him in high school is like digging always had like a very nostalgic way about him
POD1000000025_S0000025	and i do not know that this paints it accurately but this is a representation of it was like at some point did was like i am just wearing pajama pants to school every day
POD1000000025_S0000045	and so our friend justin was like you guys should work together you are 2 of my favorite rappers
POD1000000025_S0000075	i do not have the technical skill set that raphael has so like he was so fast in pro tools
POD1000000025_S0000095	this is also great listen now he says we at this one as really rapha was known right
POD1000000025_S0000098	he got named one of those but raven never would take that for himself and it was always like us
POD1000000025_S0000116	they did not understand digs very much at all i feel like the more commercial bay area scene
POD1000000025_S0000124	we were slumming it so hard when we got to ely we were so poor didg is was delivering tacos
POD1000000025_S0000129	and we did 5 years in l a before diggs went to new york to do hamilton
POD1000000025_S0000130	i think that was one of those things that came about for diggs really organically
POD1000000025_S0000131	hamilton was such an interesting like muscle like it was a play that was like legit written for him to flex all of the things he is good at
POD1000000025_S0000134	and then the world saw digs in the light that best showed everything and they not only accepted but oppressed over it
POD1000000025_S0000136	and the 1st thing that happened is this girl grabs my arm and looks at it digs and goes 0 my god is that dave digs to me
POD1000000025_S0000137	and i like start to realize that this woman is anne hathaway like and she is like fang girling out
POD1000000025_S0000140	raphael is like calling and texting and emailing and i am like getting back to the degree that i can

POD1000000025_S0000181	the closest i have ever gotten to fighting with rapha i think is like when somebody else i am close to is fighting with rapha right

POD1000000027_S0000013	for this season we are excited to work with espn is ramona shelburn one of our top nba reporters an l a native and someone who has been covering this story from the moment it broke
POD1000000027_S0000014	ramona is your host for all 5 episodes a quick word of warning this season contains mature subject matter and language and now coming up after the break from 3430 and the undefeated the sterling affairs
POD1000000027_S0000016	shelly sterling thought she was just going to return some clothes to neman marcus when she got in her mercedes van station wagon and made the drive from malabu to beverly hills it was early in the spring of 2014
POD1000000027_S0000017	and even though shelly was almost 80 years old she was still going into town as rich people called beverly hills 4 or 5 days a week it is hard to guess shelly is age if you do not know it
POD1000000027_S0000019	there are the iconic brown and yellow signs that led you know you have entered a special place and shelly sterling and her husband donald own a ton of it
POD1000000027_S0000022	but most people knew her husband donald sterling as the long time owner of the los angeles clippers one of the worst owners in all of sports his team was the laughing stock of the nba for decades
POD1000000027_S0000023	for shelly it should have been would have been just a got down rodeo drive to return some wildly expensive clothes but unbeknownst to her her husband was also at neman marcus that day
POD1000000027_S0000024	with a woman 49 years his junior named ve stevano she was not the 1st mistress not even close but ve was something different
POD1000000027_S0000026	shelly told me that story when we met in the winter of 2019 at the berkeley hills plaza hotel or my hotel as she calls it
POD1000000027_S0000027	shelly was 84 at the time but she can tell that story of that run in with donald v 5 years earlier with exacting detail
POD1000000027_S0000028	i happened to be there to return something and she was there with donald and with some other friends and we had a big confrontation she was very very very nasty and mean to me
POD1000000027_S0000029	what happened was that she ran into shelly i think at north them and they started talking and i guess things got out of hand
POD1000000027_S0000030	that is vestiano is lawyer macnehoray and when i had told shelly sterling his version of the story she scoffed
POD1000000027_S0000032	at 1st i thought it was funny that shelly took the time to correct him i mean here is a woman talking to a female reporter but her husband is infidelity who cares whether you confront your husband is mistress outside of neman markus or northwest
POD1000000027_S0000034	that in the end led to one of the biggest scandals in professional sports a controversy that forced the nfl to finally deal with donald sterling after decades of his bad behavior and had ripple effects throughout the entire league
POD1000000027_S0000036	this is the sterling affairs from 3430 podcasts and the undefeated i am ramona shelburne
POD1000000027_S0000041	i learned pretty quickly that there is no other owner in basketball with quite the same personality or ego as donald sterling sterling was not a basketball guy he was a personal injury lawyer and then he got filthy rich off a real estate
POD1000000027_S0000047	but rich people like donald sterling multi billionaire rich people do not live in the same world as the rest of us do not play by the same rules when you have enough money it is like your rubber everything just bounces off of you
POD1000000027_S0000048	even 3 decades of driving an nba franchise into the ground when you are as rich as donald and shelly you get to tell yourself that everything is fabulous
POD1000000027_S0000060	and donald sterling is life was fabulous why would he think otherwise nobody ever questioned him to his face anyway he did whatever he wanted he said whatever he wanted he had relationships with whomever he wanted
POD1000000027_S0000062	i did not know v stiviano back then and yes that is her real name v just the letter v with a period she was born maria vanessa perez
POD1000000027_S0000063	but changed her name to v stiviano at about the same time she would met donald at a super bowl party in 2010 before that she had been trying desperately to climb out of the poverty that she would grown up in
POD1000000027_S0000064	she had been running a food truck business and trying to work her way onto reality tv shows and coosing up to whom ever was the most relevant powerful or famous then she met donald
POD1000000027_S0000067	money in her maze bags are gifts and never ever humiliate the wife but bestivano either did not know or did not care because she broke every last rule in the mistress terms and agreements
POD1000000027_S0000068	she went right at shelly
POD1000000027_S0000071	she kept telling people she was going to be the next miss sterling
POD1000000027_S0000072	kathryn bauman is one of shelly is best friends and a long time clippers fan
POD1000000027_S0000073	shelly she would stock shelly she would watch where shelly would go and then she would show up and i do remember at the one time she went into the restaurant where shelly was just paraded around showed off herself then shelly locked out
POD1000000027_S0000074	at clippers games the entire extended sterling universe was usually there and usually just feet from one another sometimes shelly and donald sat at their court side seats together and v sat in her seats directly across the court
POD1000000027_S0000075	other nights v would sit next to donald and shelly was nowhere to be seen clipper players like ryan hollins and matt barnes got used to v being around you could not not notice her
POD1000000027_S0000078	clippers employees often got caught in the middle of this bizarre triangle shelly would call team president andy roger demanding that v not be allowed in the building and then donald would call roger and ask him to leave 4 tickets for her
POD1000000027_S0000079	these were relationships begging to implode but none of the entangled ever tried to solve the problem donald shelly v each kept pushing each other waiting for someone to break
POD1000000027_S0000080	well the breaking started on christmas day 2012 they called the sterling house asking to speak to donald
POD1000000027_S0000082	shelly was mortified the family was sitting at the dinner table waiting for donald as he is pacing on the tennis courts outside fighting with his mistress
POD1000000027_S0000085	the fight was shelly started when he hung up
POD1000000027_S0000086	not that that was uncommon even without ve they fought often but this was escalating shelly and donald is youngest son scott had to step in before got physical he confronted his father and demanded he stop this nonsense with v
POD1000000027_S0000091	a week later scott died
POD1000000027_S0000100	shelly was devastated
POD1000000027_S0000103	it was not just that the fight with v was a last voidable moment between donald and scott
POD1000000027_S0000105	when scott died donald stayed with a fee instead of going home to his wife as she grieved it was too much she kicked donald out of the house
POD1000000027_S0000107	shelly needed breathing room and i think dan had pushed the envelope a little too far
POD1000000027_S0000110	but shelly and donald had been together too long been through too much together had too much of their lives and their money intertwined
POD1000000027_S0000112	they did not divorce the situation simply continued to deteriorate over the next year as donald spent more and more time with v
POD1000000027_S0000114	plus shelly was starting to learn about the gifts be posted pictures on instagram be driving the $240000 red ford that donald had bought her
POD1000000027_S0000115	and the range rover and the 2 benny is shelly also found out that donald had bought v a $180 duplex
POD1000000027_S0000117	it was that anger that shelly brought to neman marcus with her returns on the faithful day that she encountered donald and v it was not the 1st time the 2 women had run into each other or argued but this time shelly decided she would had enough
POD1000000027_S0000119	on march 7th 2014 shelly sterling filed a lawsuit in california superior court against vestigiano seeking the return of all those gifts from donald
POD1000000027_S0000121	donald and shelly sterling were worth multiple 10s of dollars and had done what the ultra rich do put all their money and property into a joint trust
POD1000000027_S0000122	every dime that the sterling spent cost each of them a nickel therefore shelly argued the money that donald used to pay for the gifts was just as much hers as it was his
POD1000000027_S0000123	so she turned to the courts that sounds a little extreme well you do not know the sterlings calling a lawyer is how they get out of bed in the morning
POD1000000027_S0000126	she kept saying to donald you better have her drop the lawsuit and he would say 0 she will not really go through with it but she is just doing it for a fact and she says well she she better drop the lawsuit
POD1000000027_S0000127	but here is how the lawsuit the courtroom product of a bedroom dispute really came to change everything for some time now bee had been recording her conversations with donald
POD1000000027_S0000128	sweetie i am sorry
POD1000000027_S0000130	and according to v and her lawyer donald was aware she was making the tapes
POD1000000027_S0000135	he would recorded 100s of conversations over the past 2 years a lot of the recordings were mundane boring even but some of the recordings were arguments and captured a donald that he would never want his wife or anyone else to hear
POD1000000027_S0000137	no matter what the original intent of those tapes was they became something ve could use as a blackmail because vestivano had no intention of returning those gifts from donald
POD1000000027_S0000139	v says to donald i want that bitch wife of yours lawsuit dismissed
POD1000000027_S0000140	pierce 0 donnell is shelly sterling is
POD1000000027_S0000141	and he tried to get shelly dismissed and she would not do it
POD1000000027_S0000142	if donald could not or would not fix the situation be decided she would take matters into her own hands it was time to use the tapes
POD1000000027_S0000143	to reveal donald sterling for who he really was
POD1000000027_S0000161	on april ninth 2014 a clippers executive assistant texted v on behalf of donald
POD1000000027_S0000166	mister sterling said you let me know if you need anything you do not want to have any issues at the game
POD1000000027_S0000178	it was shocking the clippers assistant immediately emailed the file to clippers president andy roger and that is how shelly learned about the tape too
POD1000000027_S0000180	and i said well what is the tape about so i said to andy andy roeser i said andy what are you doing about this and he says 0 well she will never do anything
POD1000000027_S0000181	roger had worked for donald sterling for nearly 3 decades he did what everybody learned to do after a while stay out of the really ugly stuff
POD1000000027_S0000182	donald and shelly had cleaned up their own mess for 6 decades he figured they would eventually make this one go away too but they did not shelly told her lawyers about the tapes
POD1000000027_S0000183	and they in turn went to v is lawyer and demanded to hear them and that is when v s tiviano made her big move
POD1000000027_S0000186	mike walters was the news director at tmz at the time now he runs his own celebrity news site the blast
POD1000000027_S0000187	the 1st thing i did was say who is donald sterling i had heard the name i knew that donald sterling was important but i had no idea that he owned the clippers
POD1000000027_S0000201	the fact is shelly and several people in the clippers organization heard the recording and decided not to act on it or were not appalled enough to act on it maybe they did not understand how big a splash this tape could make
POD1000000027_S0000209	so mike walters called up the nba their new commissioner adam silver had barely been in office for 3 months
POD1000000027_S0000210	i actually had never heard of adam silver until that day
POD1000000027_S0000217	after calling the league tmz called the clippers to let them know they were about to publish a tape that would be very damaging to donald sterling
POD1000000027_S0000218	if you are donald sterling there is never a good time to have your girlfriend out you as a racist if you are the clippers this could not have happened at a worse moment donald sterling is clippers have been a laughing stock for decades
POD1000000027_S0000220	this i mean because honestly like these clippers jokes are something we they are not even jokes they are statements of fact
POD1000000027_S0000222	in the 30 somewhat years he would owned the team they would only made the playoffs 6 times they would never even move past the semifinals that had it all started to change in the late 2000s though the team had drafted a star player griffin
POD1000000027_S0000223	nba rookie of the year blake griffin
POD1000000027_S0000225	and then ended up with another star chris paul
POD1000000027_S0000226	los angeles is electric with the addition of chris paul to the clippers
POD1000000027_S0000231	in time for this season the clippers had also managed to get themselves one of the best coaches in the nba doc rivers
POD1000000027_S0000232	it is dock rivers to the clippers 3 years $210
POD1000000027_S0000240	once the clippers staff found out tmz was going to publish the tape andy roger went to coach doug rivers he needed him to talk to the team before the story broke
POD1000000027_S0000241	andy i remember coming in my office one day and said hey there is a tape that tmz has it is going to come out it is not that flattering but it is not a big deal honestly i thought it was a sex tape because of donald sterling i really did
POD1000000027_S0000242	so dock did as he was told and gathered the players and warned them that something was coming superstar clippers forward lake griffin and senator ryan holland were in that room
POD1000000027_S0000243	dock gathered us
POD1000000027_S0000244	dock said hey guys we need to meet and talk
POD1000000027_S0000253	an audio recording purportedly of los angeles clippers owner donald sterling making racist remarks to his girlfriend is being investigated by the national basketball association
POD1000000027_S0000268	like tmz is mike walters as soon as i heard that tape i knew this was going to be huge
POD1000000027_S0000270	sterling has a long history of questionable behavior
POD1000000027_S0000273	within hours the audio of donald sterling making racist remarks to v stiviano had gone viral
POD1000000027_S0000278	by morning lebron james the biggest star in the league saying there is no room for a person like donald sterling in the
POD1000000027_S0000280	and across the country adam silver was facing his 1st real crisis
POD1000000027_S0000281	nba commissioner adam silver sitting down in montreal addressing the comments made by donald sterling
POD1000000027_S0000284	i am not yet prepared to discuss any potential sanctions against donald sterling we will however move extraordinarily quickly in our investigation
POD1000000027_S0000286	if it was sterling on those tapes if they had not been doctored or altered silver knew he wanted to punish him severely the league was outraged
POD1000000027_S0000287	because on top of donald sterling saying all those unforgivably racist things sterling was also taking shots at one of the most beloved figures in all of basketball magic johnson
POD1000000027_S0000289	it was as shocking and as bizarre as anything on the tape that a picture of vestivano and magic johnson had set him off to hear donald sterling talk that way about magic
POD1000000027_S0000290	the guy who turned the lakers into a dynasty who fought off hiv that is the guy donald sterling told his mistress was not welcome at his games
POD1000000027_S0000294	even the famously apolitical michael jordan voiced his outrage
POD1000000027_S0000295	michael jordan wait in there is no room in the nba or anywhere else for the kind of racism and hatred that mister sterling allegedly expressed we cannot tolerate must not tolerate discrimination at any level
POD1000000027_S0000298	it is like what one of the paparazzi who was tailing donald and shelly told me it had all the elements sex money sports politics greed racism
POD1000000027_S0000299	it had everything it even had the visor you remember the visor that dave punk welding mask meets florida grandma visor that bee stiviana wore anytime she stepped outside of her house
POD1000000027_S0000300	but still saying nothing is v stiviano not late this afternoon when she arrived home or when she left tonight wearing different clothes but color coordinated face shields
POD1000000027_S0000302	have you talked to mister sterling can you explain the mask
POD1000000027_S0000306	by the end of the weekend the 1st black president of the united states was answering questions about sterling
POD1000000027_S0000309	the tapes dominated the news cycle not just because they were juicy but because donald sterling was articulating something deeper more shameful
POD1000000027_S0000314	including ryan hollins
POD1000000027_S0000318	los angeles sits on 2 fault lines san andreas and race all of us know it we live with it donald sterling was another
POD1000000027_S0000319	anyone who played for him or work for him or covered him in the press or lived in one of his 100s of apartments on the one hand knew that it was all a matter of time until he blew up the underlying issues with sterling were well known and well documented
POD1000000027_S0000320	but like most insanely wealthy white man in america donald had managed to wiggle bully and fight his way out of all of them he knew how to play his leverage and power to outlast his adversaries and win you can call it that
POD1000000029_S0000002	from american public media this is marketplace tech demystifying the digital economy i am jack stewart in for molly wood
POD1000000029_S0000006	nearly every crisis facebook now faces stems from that nicholas thompson editor and chief of wired says that is left management to navigate a metaphorical minefield
POD1000000029_S0000010	secondly one of the smartest business decisions that mark zuckerberg ever made was to buy instagram and people do not really understand that instagram is owned by facebook or if they distrust facebook they do not distrust instagram so instagram continues to grow
POD1000000029_S0000023	absolutely what are the stakes to their business they are very high if scandal continues to multiply there could be real consequences down the road what are the stakes specifically to top management meaning mark zuckerberg and sheryl sandberg the 2 people who we most associate with the company
POD1000000029_S0000024	for zuckerberg he is going to run the company as long as he wants to he has you know voting control of the shares he is appointed his friends as board members he is in a good position
POD1000000029_S0000025	whenever he wants to go and run the chan zuckerberg initiative or just go be an intellectual thought leader or do bill gates type things he will go choose to do that for sandberg it is tougher
POD1000000029_S0000026	and there were moments in the last year where it seemed like she might be sacrificed or where she might be in big trouble zuckerberg has expressed his loyalty to her
POD1000000029_S0000036	there was one specific story that stunned me and that was the circumstances that led to the departure of the 2 founders of instagram kevin systrom and mike krieger
POD1000000029_S0000037	and when fred vogelstein and i started reporting the story you know we made a list of the mysteries we wanted to solve and that was at the very top why had they left it seemed strange they had left all of a sudden in september
POD1000000029_S0000038	no one knew why and late in the reporting you know months into reporting the story we finally learned the full story and that is that according to people close to them they had grown frustrated with zuckerberg is increased meddling
POD1000000029_S0000040	and there is a sense among some people at facebook that instagram is growth was coming at the expense of core facebook and that led to all kinds of tensions and then a big fight at the end of july and a moment where mark zuckerberg
POD1000000029_S0000042	and then he gave the list to kevin systrom and said we are getting rid of all of these and according to people familiar with the story system reacted quite badly to that and then went on parental leave came back and said i am done here
POD1000000029_S0000043	and so the biggest surprise to us was that the departure of systrom and krieger which had not come out before was much tense much tense than i had believed when i began reporting this story
POD1000000029_S0000044	nick thompson editor and chief of wired for context a $50 fine would be a record tech penalty in the us beating the 220 that google had to pay in 2012
POD1000000029_S0000049	if you enjoyed mark zuckerberg is testimony in front of congress here in the us with his zinging comebacks like senator we run ads then maybe you will enjoy hearing more directly from mister zuckerberg himself
POD1000000029_S0000050	i mean facebook was accused of not being open enough i am not really sure how deep into the heads of tech entrepreneurs you really want to get but zuck does have a podcast now i am not suggesting you listen i am just giving you this information

POD1000000047_S0000000	welcome to the 80000 hours podcast this interview with david spiegelhalter is a bit unusual and that it was actually recorded 2 years ago
POD1000000047_S0000002	we were considering starting a podcast back then and i recorded this trial episode with my colleague jess whittlestone but ultimately we did not have the time to go ahead with the project but i thought why not dig it up and release it now
POD1000000047_S0000004	david spiegelhalter is a statistician at the university of cambridge and something of an academic celebrity in the uk
POD1000000047_S0000016	to help us answer some of these questions we are joined by professor david spiegelhalter the winthrop professor for the public understanding of risk at cambridge university professor spike holter spent much of his life trying to improve public understanding of statistics science and risk in ordinary life
POD1000000047_S0000115	yeah i have actually written an article with a professor toby ord about why we should not discount health even though we should discount financial returns about why why it is appropriate in one case and not on the other so we will put up a link to that on the website
POD1000000047_S0000244	yeah i think that is about all we got time for now but thanks so much david this has been very important and really interesting
POD1000000047_S0000247	right if you would like to hear more from professor spike halter then you can find his blog understanding uncertainty online and he is also often on the radio in the uk in particular on more or less on bbc 4
POD1000000048_S0000001	hi i am rob director of research at 80000 hours today i am speaking with miles brundidge research fellow at the university of oxford is future of humanity institute
POD1000000048_S0000003	miles research has been supported by the national science fundation the biopartisan policy center and the future of life institute so thanks for making time to talk to us today miles
POD1000000048_S0000051	and miles you have a 4th coming guide to work on ai policy and strategy that that we are going to link to so so here we are going to try to go go beyond that so if you find yourself a little bit confused then potentially just go and read one of those one of those documents 1st
POD1000000048_S0000059	so there has been a little bit of work for example by armstrong at all at the future of humanity institute looking at arms race type scenarios involving ai where there would be an incentive to skimp
POD1000000048_S0000095	so the example i mentioned of the paper by armstrong at all called the racing to the perpsecus is is one example and it presented sort of a stark version of the arms race scenario
POD1000000048_S0000100	progress to be made so there was a paper put out by the future of humanity institute by nick bostrom carrick flynn and allan defoe recently that looks at policy disciplinara for the development of machine super intelligence
POD1000000048_S0000116	another resource that comes to mind is a syllabus for a class on the global politics of ai developed by allen defoe at yale and the future of humanity institutes
POD1000000048_S0000191	so otherwise i i would say that that is a good place to to go so and likewise we do not really know what the agenda of the trump administration is on the ai frame
POD1000000048_S0000314	yeah and i suppose you can always just track the things that are you know people like you or nick bostrom are saying and and how you speak about the issue so that you so that you do not come across as a as an alarmist and you you know you have a measure and a precise tone
POD1000000048_S0000338	so you know there are people at fhi who also are affiliated with the center for effective altruism and involved in you know building the ea community like owen cotton barratt and toby ord
POD1000000048_S0000350	and it took the work of nick bostrom and super intelligence and stewart russell and giving a lot of talks and writing opeds to call more attention to it and give it more legimacy

YOU1000000020_S0000183	jacob wilson has been utterly dominant this weekend but he just suffered a brutal loss in hands of eric forlach and if he does not make the top 8 that last play is going to come back to haunt

YOU1000000020_S0000209	hello and welcome to the last quarter final of pro tour favorite forge we are going to start off with yelger vegas against jacob wilson a 19 year old
YOU1000000020_S0000211	let us get right down to the floor and see who is going to win between yelger wegishima and jacob wilson
YOU1000000020_S0000213	the uger is hand has everything
YOU1000000020_S0000215	jacob is in game 3 and a 2 out of 3 against
YOU1000000020_S0000216	yelger vegasma who is a dutch hall of fame magic player so not an easy opponent
YOU1000000020_S0000218	game one yelger had an instant win combo that involved making an infinite number of pharisees that all attack at once for infinite damage
YOU1000000020_S0000219	and then in game 2 jacob was able to survive despite the fact that yelger reigned an anger of the gods that destroyed all of jacob is creatures
YOU1000000020_S0000220	but then jacob summoned an elephant soldier called loxodon smither that finished the job and killed yelgar in game 2 so now we are on to game 3
YOU1000000020_S0000221	jacob has got a very good start but yelger is deck is capable of winning in an eye blink so the suspense is pretty good
YOU1000000020_S0000223	voice of resurgence he is running through what could he have jacob does not have a lot of outs here things are not looking good for him
YOU1000000020_S0000225	going to put this splunter twin on this pestermite do you have a response shows the path to exile to yelger who now will show him the dispense
YOU1000000020_S0000228	the game there is the hand yeah ye
YOU1000000020_S0000230	another great performance from young jacob wilson but it was not quite enough against the dutch hall of fame i know this has to be so disappointing for him
YOU1000000020_S0000232	you are graded on how many top 8s you have achieved i think that ultimately jacob is going to embrace that fact
YOU1000000020_S0000254	invitational enrichment i am here with our champion jacob wilson congratulations man thank you very much at the handshake takes a little bit of hardware you are no stranger to this
YOU1000000023_S0000002	fire emblem is turning 30 next year and with 16 main games and a few spin offs it is safe to say that it is grown into something extraordinary the games are packed with deep storylines and memorable characters like marth
YOU1000000023_S0000003	that is not marth marth that is which one is marth
YOU1000000023_S0000005	martha
YOU1000000023_S0000022	that way the audience could be like 0 that guy is wearing a tight fitting suit with a bunch of weird patches that must be arlecchino the servant clown sometimes to 2 masters this brought the audience in immediately they knew what that character was about without any exposition
YOU1000000023_S0000027	cain and abel are battle bros they fight together but not in the biblical sense board and cords are similar except they are usually ax fighters pegeasist sisters are a trio of flying horses ladies
YOU1000000023_S0000028	you can not split these archetypes up into their solo characters because their bond is what defines them you can not have a waluigi without a luigi and in the same way you can not have a board without a cord which is my favorite doctor
YOU1000000023_S0000029	jagans are mentors that are strong at the beginning and then you will quickly outpace them and it is kind of sad like the 1st time you beat your dad in a basketball game oifias are similar to jagans except they will keep dunking on you till you are dead
YOU1000000023_S0000030	wendells are mentors but for magic gotoes are mentors but only the last half of the game beavers are mercenaries that you have to pay actual in game currency to recruit and ogmas are mercenaries that usually decide to join you out of their own volition
YOU1000000023_S0000034	you can not get the other kind of like if 2 of your friends start dating and then have a really messy breakup cornelius is are usually the parental figure to the main character and they have this nasty habit of getting axed super early on in the game
YOU1000000023_S0000035	it is kind of like fire emblem does not know how to make interesting characters without making them suffer traumatic parental death
YOU1000000023_S0000049	but before i get there i just want to commend fire emblem for having 596 playable characters and only repeating 3 names when i was hired for my 1st job at a climbing gym i was one of 5 employees named brian
YOU1000000023_S0000054	that took like 30 minutes but let us begin the honorable knight like fiona who cares passionately about her people and will always oppose crime to civilians
YOU1000000023_S0000055	which is way better than the loyal night like trude who only is loyal to pern and will do literally anything for him even though pern is a bad dude but i will get to that later
YOU1000000023_S0000059	but that is not my fault super smash should have included more magic babies arogance hot heads and edge lords all have a mean side but arogance like vicky just think they are the best hot heads like caspar want to fight anything that moves
YOU1000000023_S0000060	and edge lords like nile is retweet joker accounts unironically a lot of these characters have rough childhoods but then turn out cheerful despite that and then there is the inferiority complex archetype which i could have just called the majority of children in fire emblem fates
YOU1000000023_S0000061	perfectionists mischief makers and flirts are all highly motivated but subaki is motivated to meet high expectations claude is motivated to make intricate schemes and sylvane is motivated to be a fuck boy
YOU1000000023_S0000062	buzz kills are just characters that are not very fun to talk to and fire emblem i will never forgive you for naming an unemotional uber religious deadbeat dad gilbert it also does not help that i look like hanneman light
YOU1000000023_S0000064	0 god am i a buzz kill a lot of these archetypes are based around one singular personality type scarlet straightforward valbars chill linhart is lazy sumia is clummy petra is a sweetie and ran off is a furry
YOU1000000023_S0000066	child soldier karen is canonically 14 years old
YOU1000000023_S0000069	manuela is constantly drinking and flirting and just being a hot mess and i love her for it and that makes her the president of vices
YOU1000000023_S0000070	the vice president but be careful not to do that around someone like astram who is constantly accusing people of treason for no good reason
YOU1000000023_S0000072	here is an archetype i call what the fuck and it is the 3 characters that make me say what the fuck fire emblem people like pern who is said to be a sweet robin hood type except he does kidnap a young girl and keeps her as his slave
YOU1000000023_S0000073	or tharga who practices curses on her own daughter or roger who is actually he is not actually that bad
YOU1000000023_S0000074	but fire emblem does go out of their way to make his end scream say that he never gets a date and he stays single for the rest of his life and it is like what the fuck fire emblem you did not have to do him dirty like that
YOU1000000023_S0000075	the next archetype is called actually pretty interesting these characters are 3 dimensional and well developed people like libra who struggles with his faith and has incredible self doubt even though he is doing all he can to help those around him
YOU1000000023_S0000076	or rice who dreams of being a swordfighter but his weak constitution will not allow him to become one and so he helps in the ways he can but his whole story is one of unfulfilled dreams
YOU1000000023_S0000078	and that is it those are the only 2 interesting characters in fire emblem until we get to raphael my sweet bulky boy who only cares about eating and training and not about studying
YOU1000000023_S0000094	and that just sounds like a pretty run of the mill awkward family reunion when you think about it these ones are just they are strange characters that have that are good at me if you include dimitri in this he has an ipad
YOU1000000023_S0000095	which is similar to these sets and bylife have the they rhyme we also i mean dorthea hat wears a hat until she grows out of the hat think about that do not even get me started on aboro
YOU1000000023_S0000101	you know the servant clown sometimes to 2 masters
YOU1000000023_S0000106	all that dudes went in the tight fitting suit with the vergil weird patches it must be arlekin the servant claw sometimes the 22 masters okay
YOU1000000029_S0000001	the polls have closed in 3 more states at 730 in the east at this point bill clinton has 58 electoral votes bob dole nothing yet
YOU1000000029_S0000003	cnn coverage of election 96 live from cnn center here are judy woodruff bernard shaw bill schneider and ken body
YOU1000000029_S0000005	and the biggest electoral prize at this half hour we can tell you is the state of ohio cnn calls that the state of ohio has been won by president clinton this is a big victory ken body for the democrats
YOU1000000029_S0000007	cnn declares that bill clinton has won west virginia is 5 electoral votes
YOU1000000029_S0000010	judy this is fairly typical for north carolina this is a generally republican state and presidential races but george bush won this state by less than one last time his very closest state
YOU1000000029_S0000019	now let us move over to the electoral map to show you what we have so far president clinton leading bob dole 58 electoral votes the magic number is 270
YOU1000000029_S0000023	florida before that those are 2 big states and both in the clinton column
YOU1000000029_S0000025	so we have is the republicans in a little bit of difficulty here
YOU1000000029_S0000027	well kentucky and indiana is fascinating that just fascinating and and and the word was that if if dole started out in trouble in kentucky and indiana if he lost them out right the night would be
YOU1000000029_S0000030	in june he said if bob dole that he calls himself bob dole he says if bob dole does not win kentucky bob dole can not win the presidency but we do not know yet but it is a tight one
YOU1000000029_S0000031	that is right let us take a look now at the states that we know one or the other has one and here it is for president clinton florida you have been hearing this new hampshire ohio vermont and west virginia
YOU1000000029_S0000036	bill schneider you want to take over with the angry polls here and and i will save a thought i had
YOU1000000029_S0000037	we are going to take a look at the state of ohio a big win for bill clinton and see how did he do it well 13rd of the voters in ohio were union members in the household
YOU1000000029_S0000038	and they clearly went a majority a solid majority for bill clinton that big afl cio push for the democrats and for the democratic president paid off in ohio
YOU1000000029_S0000040	now let us look at the voters who decided how they were going to vote just in the last 3 days how do they end up voting well they voted for bob dole it looks like bob dole talked about his momentum in the last few days
YOU1000000029_S0000042	they were the ones who delivered for bill clinton and that was 70% of the voters in ohio so while dole picked up some late momentum
YOU1000000029_S0000044	you are very good with that john madden not to be gealous tonight
YOU1000000029_S0000048	live from washington crossfire on the left geraldine ferraro on the right robert novak in the crossfire
YOU1000000029_S0000049	republican senator john mccain of arizona advisor to the dollar kemp campaign and in new orleans democratic senator john brown
YOU1000000029_S0000051	good evening welcome to crossfire finally election day came with bill clinton casting his vote in the renovated train station at little rock arkansas and bob dole voting at the 1st christian church in russellville kansas
YOU1000000029_S0000052	the other 10s of americans voting today decided that 35 senate contests and 435 house races as well as the president clinton is heavily favored for a 2nd term
YOU1000000029_S0000053	and the big question is who controls congress what the republicans nearly favor jerry
YOU1000000029_S0000057	we have had ohio that is gone for clinton we have kentucky which does also was a must win so state too close to call
YOU1000000029_S0000058	you see that that florida has gone to a president clinton if if dole is in trouble in the south do you see any scenario by which he could win this presidency tonight
YOU1000000029_S0000059	well jerry it is as i mentioned before we went on i just came off of the 96 hour trip with senator dole we saw enthusiasm every place we went i think that california is still in play
YOU1000000029_S0000060	i think that there is a lot of southern states that went for a president clinton last time and i certainly think that even though they may be a quote undecided i still believe connecticut and indiana for example will go
YOU1000000029_S0000061	for senator dole but i do not discount the importance of farming and ohio they are important states
YOU1000000029_S0000062	so that so that with all things being equal if if this trend continues senator dole will say in washington or go back to kansas but not be president of the united states
YOU1000000029_S0000067	my feeling is that we pick up like one seat i am sure that john bro may have a different view but i think we pick up the 4 southern open democrat seats
YOU1000000029_S0000069	senator john breaux this is a very good news for president clinton but i wonder if you are topping champagne cork
YOU1000000029_S0000072	and bobby you must be struggling this is devastating news for senator dole in a sense when you do not not carry ohio which every republican president has always carried and you lose florida that is very bad news for senator dole
YOU1000000029_S0000073	as far as a winning an electoral victory and we are not finished voting here in louisiana we got about an hour and a half left and i am very confident that mary landrieu will be victorious
YOU1000000029_S0000074	i think i would agree with john mccain my friend that the senate is going to be very close i would not be surprised if it was 5149 either way
YOU1000000029_S0000076	but i i just would like to address my my initial question senator on on how you can square the apparent big victory of president clinton
YOU1000000029_S0000079	because of what he says or she says in their respective states is it is not that connected to the presidential election i think you can have people voting for president clinton and perhaps voting for a republican senator
YOU1000000029_S0000081	is not it true that the the problem is that some of your candidates in the south like mary landreau and louisiana and max cleland and georgia were election year moderates they have been liberals all their life and perhaps the voters saw through them
YOU1000000029_S0000082	they charging mary landrieu with being a liable here is a person who supports the death penalty supports carrying concealed weapons in louisiana and also will support a constitutional amendment to balance the budget that does not sound very liable
YOU1000000029_S0000088	there you go again falling for some of the republican rhetoric she clearly has said that she would have voted just like me and benny johnson on that issue but her opponent and others keep saying well that is not her position that is what she said very clearly
YOU1000000029_S0000092	crossfire is brought to you by lci international a very different long distance phone company and by chrysler and the cab forward sedan of chrysler what is new in your world
YOU1000000029_S0000094	we are talking about election 96 with senator john mccain republican of arkansas and an adult advisor in new orleans senator john brown democrat of louisiana
YOU1000000029_S0000097	are you guys going to go after the clinton administration again for another 4 years are you going to you are going to get dad to some serious work in the senate for a change
YOU1000000029_S0000098	jerry could i mention what real quick before i answer and that is that we are pleased to see the closure and the popular vote as you know many of the polls like abc had president clinton by 16 and the teens
YOU1000000029_S0000102	we just saw on the front pages of the new york times today mister riady had what 12 visits
YOU1000000029_S0000107	well what i hope is that we have a howard baker on the democratic side as they did during watergate a bipartisan democrat will say look we have got to look into this and we have got to go with it
YOU1000000029_S0000110	and i will take you up on that john breaux are you ready to play the role of howard baker and ask bill clinton what did he know and when did he know it about this amounted money from indonesia
YOU1000000029_S0000111	bob the problem is bipartisan is a bipartisan problem just yesterday one person who was a supporter and worked for the dole campaign confessed to make an $120000 illicit contribution
YOU1000000029_S0000112	i think the american people want us to to look at some new campaign finance reform john mccain i think is a leader on this issue or with long with our democratic side that is what i think the people want they want to make sure we do it right in the future
YOU1000000029_S0000116	well well john is a realistic louisiana politician and you are one of the best of them you would you agree with me that a lot is at stake tonight for the president
YOU1000000035_S0000003	one being the feared and immense kangal
YOU1000000035_S0000016	today i am visiting carl westfield in the uk who is guardian of several candles

YOU1000000035_S0000036	dave his male cangrel just wanted to be petted and loved to roll over and fall down in my lap
YOU1000000035_S0000037	the 2 dogs had an obvious rowing curiosity and carl mentioned that he preferred to keep them leashed
YOU1000000035_S0000040	well carl these are beautiful beautiful dogs that it is the 1st time i have ever met a cangle dog you get this sort of idea when people go on about them being
YOU1000000035_S0000043	you know a a a good kangara is completely solid temperament basically car calm until rows
YOU1000000035_S0000059	let us just quickly talk about dave is ears here because i know people comment a lot about cropped ears
YOU1000000035_S0000061	when they have been very very young and of of course little dave here is a is an import so he is he is not being cropped here in the uk
YOU1000000035_S0000062	and carl certainly does not prop any of the years and of course as you can see here on the female this is what there is are supposed to look like
YOU1000000035_S0000090	is farne with a black mask
YOU1000000035_S0000115	later that week i dropped by to meet a very special lady indeed sheila reed respected across the uk for her expertise in the cangle breed
YOU1000000035_S0000116	both her and her husband michael had kept cangales for decades now and had traveled out to turkey many times to source dogs from working lines
YOU1000000035_S0000120	our old dog had died and we just wanted we wanted a natural dog we went to see a lady called miss betty marshall
YOU1000000035_S0000121	and she brought out her dog called fenna he stood on his back legs and he put his paws on my shoulders
YOU1000000035_S0000187	i was deeply moved by sheila is stories and found out information i did not previously know such as there being varying types of cangale
YOU1000000035_S0000197	sheila also nicely cleared up the kangle versus anatolian shepherd debate and explained why these 2 dog breeds are certainly not the same
YOU1000000035_S0000206	if you would like to find out more about cangles you can contact karl via his web page
YOU1000000038_S0000001	thank you for joining us i am spencer tilless
YOU1000000038_S0000002	and i am to sell espinalas
YOU1000000038_S0000012	and i would be surprised if raven is head coach john harvell had his own fantasy football draft regular season is right around the corner we will let you know our picks
YOU1000000038_S0000021	spencer you know the lions are one of the teams that every other team in the baseline north division actually circles on their calendar so they mean business
YOU1000000038_S0000026	and what i really was impressed with was bradley how calm and composed he was throughout that interview and throughout the game
YOU1000000038_S0000043	and the fact is i mean stephen decatur that is they had guys that they were handing the ball off to running hard downhill and they also had a guy that was about £250 and he was laying guys out i mean he was picking up yards you want to talk about falling forward to get the 1st down
YOU1000000038_S0000044	he was definitely get that done out there for jessica and i feel like moving forward they got a good thing going there it is always nice when you have a couple guys you can hand the ball to
YOU1000000038_S0000047	and as coach knox said the cream usually comes to the top
YOU1000000038_S0000049	and seaford they hosted a 4 team scrimmage yesterday which included parkside james and bennett and colonel richardson now a strong play for bull teams in this thing
YOU1000000038_S0000050	and speaking of a strong place check out this run here by tj hayward i mean just knocking guys out of his way barreling downhill cornell richardson was moving the ball as well on this thing their coach sneaks here in the middle up the crease and
YOU1000000038_S0000051	making a lot of guys miss he is going to be a got to watch this year parkside in the other hand they were getting it done through the air aerin this one out way downhill devin redding slights that beautiful catch there for completion
YOU1000000038_S0000055	you know spencer actually being out there on saturday it felt like each team was actually playing for a championship one team that stood out from the rest of them were the rams and i mean their running game was on point finding the holes evading defenders they could do no wrong in my eyes
YOU1000000038_S0000056	on the other hand one of the teams that made some mistakes on both sides of the ball were the blue jays i spoke to coach darling and he said his team is too selfish right now and is trying to get them to be a more cohesive unit and you know the scrimmage is actually going to help them get to that better direction
YOU1000000038_S0000057	absolutely and it is always tough to do that is his 1st year at the program so moving forward you kind of need to get that senior leadership and kind of establish yourself so i am sure it will be fine down the stretch but early on that is always tough to go but the thing that really impressed me was parkside i mean they had some guys down the field that were definitely making some plays of the ball
YOU1000000038_S0000063	how are you doing i am mack griffith from easton high school head varsity football coach you are watching the del marva sports insider
YOU1000000038_S0000066	we are our own trey mills who is a why high alum had a chance to talk to his own coach about the program is direction tray were you tempted to put on some gear and do you miss it
YOU1000000038_S0000069	so i stopped by practice and chatted with my former jv coach now varsity head coach pat mcglinchey to see exactly what why high i will need to improve upon to return to the base side dominance
YOU1000000038_S0000076	my man nelson brown will be featured in this office talk about him and why he excels at what he does
YOU1000000038_S0000077	nelson brown is just one of those phenomenal athletes he is not an athlete that comes around all the time you know nelson is being looked at by division one double a football schools
YOU1000000038_S0000078	he is a scholarship kid and we are waiting on that 1st scholarship morgan state has been really looking hard at him but you know beside that he is just he goes out there and he is the ultra competitor
YOU1000000038_S0000081	i would say the the newcomer that i am looking forward to the most is raekwon mccarter he is just at every single thing that we could offer he he goes to the off season training the weight room the beach
YOU1000000038_S0000083	you got a new guy here at corner keandre custon who when we saw him at the ben tate camp honestly in my eyes he was the best corner there talk about him and what what this young defense will bring to the table
YOU1000000038_S0000084	yeah our d backs this year are are pretty much all new like you said keandre is one of those guys is going to try to shut you down a line of scrimmage
YOU1000000038_S0000088	there is that man nelson brown he was out on saturday with a shoulder bruise just procussionary he told me he expects to practice on monday there is another star shayne leatherbarry and he is a veteran and natural born leader of the wildcats i expect those young guys there to look up to him
YOU1000000038_S0000092	gets the pick right there he is out on the island by himself and this guy will be a natural born leader one thing i really liked about why high was their defensive line that right there is teresa savage breaking through and dropping leatherbarry for the sack
YOU1000000038_S0000093	i am telling you him and mel morris are 2 the studs on the defensive line this play right here by this young man raquel mccarter is just a fabulous play look at him take it down through the middle and get those defenders out of his way that is just a filthy move excuse me thank you for a touchdown
YOU1000000038_S0000094	this kid is going to be a student not to be out done del mar junior dejor brown takes the hand off straight up the middle 60 yards out and he did not even get touched folks he has got some burners he had a great scrimmage as well
YOU1000000038_S0000095	and for del mar coach dave hearn he knows that the pre season is all about figuring his team out
YOU1000000038_S0000102	my name is david wells inside linebacker for james and bennett and you are watching dan more sports inside
YOU1000000038_S0000105	head coach wheatley is team will be trying to make it to the state tournament after coming up with just one game short a year ago finishing with a 9 and 6 record that right there was sarah davis putting on the moves from way outside and scoring it just a beautiful goal
YOU1000000038_S0000106	and then just a few minutes later of the raiders they were right back at it they found the net one more time this one was from brady keeler with the honors with a beautiful slap shot
YOU1000000038_S0000110	and the fact is i looked at this team and i we went in and i was talking with coach really afterwards they had they knew they were going to be able to score the ball and they knew they had a good opportunity of being a very high scoring team but they did not realize how good they were going to be defensively and they definitely showed that in the scramble
YOU1000000038_S0000114	and by the way congratulations to coach or coach wheatley she actually just got married a couple weeks ago
YOU1000000038_S0000119	we have got 15 girls out here we kind of tried to go with our most athletic girls and just kind of work with it from there but they are very excited coach jackson and i are very excited so it is always cool to have a new program give the kids more experiences
YOU1000000038_S0000124	and spencer one of the things that they have to also see is being able to build that roster and see who is actually going to be able to perform well on the court
YOU1000000038_S0000129	this is monica wheatley for the woodbridge field hockey team and you are watching the del mara sports insider
YOU1000000038_S0000132	my sleeper pick is actually someone i went to high school with t y hilton from the cults a wide receiver and he was as impressive with andrew luck he was impressive as andrew luck is number one option last season after the injury to pro cane redgy wayne
YOU1000000038_S0000133	mean just look at those stats from last season hilton had 1083 yards and 5 touchdowns he is speedy and sure wayne is coming back this season but i think hilton will put a big numbers this season
YOU1000000038_S0000135	yeah well my sleeper i did not go to high school with but i am going with e j manuel manuel missed 6 games last season with an hyper extended knee but he has got some serious weapons now c j spiller fred jack jackson
YOU1000000038_S0000136	they traded up in the draft for sammy watkins he is a monster they added robert woods and speed the marquise goodwin and they both got mike williams on and i mean there is a lot of weapons there a lot of young weapons but they are very talented he is undrafted in most leagues you know
YOU1000000038_S0000138	i think this is a big reason why he is undrafted in most of the leagues i am sleeping on manuel
YOU1000000038_S0000139	but the guy i am going with i mean tides are always hard to find i think ladarius green is going to have a big year for these chargers in this year
YOU1000000038_S0000140	i mean he did not exactly have amazing numbers last year i get it just 13 catches and 3 d is but he started to take more and more reps with the ones philip rivers loves his tight ends and i think he is going to get a lot of balls thrown in his way this year
YOU1000000038_S0000147	i got gronk i know someone out there also has rob gronkowski as their bus i know this guy coming up with an acl injury and he is no adrian peterson let us be real the unlucky number here is 14 and no that is not the number of touchdowns
YOU1000000038_S0000149	he is also had 8 career surgeries i just do not see the spark in grounkowski how much can you really physically overcome this season the game is just getting even harder
YOU1000000038_S0000150	i do not know anytime you got brady i feel like you are going to be all right
YOU1000000038_S0000152	sorry not sorry eagles fans but i am going with nick foles yeah know what you are saying nick foles had amazing numbers last season which is exactly why i am staying away from them teams now have film on them and they are prepared for chip kelly is offense
YOU1000000038_S0000153	plus he lost the shawn jackson he looked lost when i was up there at eagles camp guys but some of all the other eagles quarterbacks but i am not saying do not draft the eagle especially the shawn mccoy
YOU1000000038_S0000154	but i do not think michael foles is going to put up half the numbers he put up last year
YOU1000000038_S0000157	i mean this guy is definitely going to say away from though is eric decker i mean this guy is definitely going to say away from though is eric decker i mean he had some good numbers in denver but the fact is that offense is ridiculous there
