POD1000000016_S0000183	AFTER EVERYTHING THAT BLACK AMERICANS HAVE BEEN THROUGH IN THIS COUNTRY THAT THEY DIDN'T IMMEDIATELY TAKE UP LINCOLN'S OFFER AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE AND START OVER IS REALLY AN ASTOUNDING TESTIMONY TO THEIR BELIEF IN THE AMERICAN IDEALS

POD1000000019_S0000115	THEN ONE DAY IN BLACKMAN'S APARTMENT JEANNIE'S LAYING NAKED ON THE COUCH AFTER HAVING SEX WITH HIM WHEN SHE'S SUDDENLY BLINDED BY FLASHES OF BRIGHT LIGHT THERE'S BLACKMAN HOLDING A CAMERA WITH A STROBE FLASH ATTACHMENT
POD1000000019_S0000126	HE HIRES JEANNIE AS A SECRETARY WHICH IS WHERE SHE'S WORKING WHEN A SONGWRITER FRIEND ASKS HER TO SING ON THE DEMO OF HIS NEW SONG HE WANTS SHELBY SINGLETON AT PLANTATION RECORDS TO HEAR
POD1000000019_S0000127	I COULDN'T FIND A RECORDING OF JEANNIE SINGING IT BUT I FOUND THE SONGWRITER SINGING IT HIMSELF SO YOU CAN TRY TO IMAGINE WHAT JEANNIE WOULD HAVE SOUNDED LIKE ON THE DEMO

POD1000000019_S0000141	SHELBY TELLS JEANNIE THEY'LL USE HER MIDDLE INITIAL TO MAKE HER STAND OUT MORE FROM THE OTHER JEANNIES AND ADD AN I TO HER FIRST NAME SO PEOPLE KNOW IT'S NOT PRONOUNCED JEAN
POD1000000019_S0000142	FINDING OUT SHE REALLY DOESN'T HAVE TO BE RHONDA RENAE PLUS THE FACT THAT EVERYONE IN THE ROOM SEEMS CERTAIN SHE JUST CUT A MASSIVE HIT SONG IMPROVES JEANNIE'S MOOD

POD1000000019_S0000155	ANYWAY PRETTY SOON JEANNIE STARTS SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME WITH HER MANAGER PAUL PERRY ONE NIGHT THEY'RE SITTING AROUND HOLDING HANDS AND PERRY'S TALKING ABOUT HOW CAREFUL JEANNIE HAS TO BE NOW THAT SHE'S ON TOP
POD1000000019_S0000159	MADE FROM HER OLD SESSIONS WITH HIM NOW THAT JEANNIE'S GOT THE BIGGEST HIT IN THE NATION THESE RECORDS WILL SELL
POD1000000019_S0000161	BLACKMAN'S GOT A MANILLA ENVELOPE LIKE YOU SEE IN EVERY MOVIE ABOUT A PRIVATE DETECTIVE AND HE WANTS TO GIVE IT TO JEANNIE BUT FIRST SHE'S GOTTA SIGN A NEW PIECE OF PAPER SAYING SHE WON'T SUE HIM FOR RELEASING HER OLD RECORDINGS
POD1000000019_S0000170	WHICH IS ALSO THE EXPLANATION FOR WHY JEANNIE WOULD BE IN LAS VEGAS OPENING UP FOR JOHNNY PAYCHECK WHEN ALL SHE'S SUPPOSEDLY DONE IS ONE BARELY RELEASED SINGLE FOR BLACK ROSE RECORDS
POD1000000019_S0000184	SOMETHING PHYSICAL FOR JEANNIE TO PLAY PRETEND WITH TO KEEP THE WHOLE CHARADE GOING IT WAS CALLED YOU WRITE THE MUSIC CREDITED TO JEAN RILEY RELEASED ON LITTLE DARLIN RECORDS IN NINETEEN SIXTY-SEVEN
POD1000000019_S0000188	NOW HERE ARE THE TWO BIG QUESTIONS I DON'T THINK I CAN OR SHOULD EVEN TRY TO ANSWER DID AUBREY MAYHEW AND JEANNIE C RILEY HAVE AN AFFAIR
POD1000000019_S0000201	SHE GETS TO DO PICKIN WILD MOUNTAIN BERRIES WITH GLEN CAMPBELL ON T V
POD1000000019_S0000208	IF YOU'RE STARTING TO GET THE IDEA THAT JEANNIE'S ALWAYS THOUGHT OF AS LITTLE MORE THAN A PUPPET FOR THE PEOPLE BEHIND THE SCENES OF HER CAREER I WOULD SAY THAT SEEMS ACCURATE
POD1000000019_S0000213	AND WHILE THE SONG IS ACTUALLY SUNG BY THE DAUGHTER CHARACTER WHO DOESN'T DRESS THAT WAY EVERY TIME YOU SEE JEANNIE C RILEY SHE LOOKS LIKE MRS JOHNSON
POD1000000019_S0000228	FROM THE NIGHTMARE SHE DESCRIBES YOU'D EXPECT THAT TO BE THE ONLY TIME SHE EVER TOKED UP BUT THERE'S A VIDEO CLIP OF RALPH EMERY INTERVIEWING HER SEEMS TO SUGGEST OTHERWISE
POD1000000019_S0000234	THE ONLY OTHER WOMAN TO DO THAT IN THE NINETEEN HUNDREDS IS DOLLY PARTON WITH NINE TO FIVE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY-ONE MAKING JEANNIE THE FIRST WOMAN TO EVER DO IT IF YOU DON'T COUNT THE FARCE WITH LITTLE DARLIN RECORDS
POD1000000019_S0000252	HERE'S HER DOING IT IN JONI CASH SHOW
POD1000000019_S0000261	LIKE THE L A TIMES POP CRITIC ROBERT HILBURN WHO REVIEWED A JEANNIE C RILEY CONCERT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY-ONE UNDER THE HEADLINE LETTER TALENT
POD1000000019_S0000268	SHE ALWAYS HAD A CRACK BAND BEHIND HER THE HARPER VALLEY EXPRESS THEY USUALLY MADE THE TEMPO OF EVERYTHING FASTER TO REALLY PUT SOME GAS IN THE TANK AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO DENY JEANNIE'S CHARISMA AS A PERFORMER
POD1000000019_S0000274	NOT ONLY WAS JEANNIE NOT A ONE-HIT WONDER SHE MADE GOOD ALBUMS WITH VERY LITTLE FILLER CHECK OUT THE ALBUM TRACK FROM NINETEEN SEVENTY-TWO NEVER EVEN RELEASED AS A SINGLE CALLED WITHOUT YOU
POD1000000019_S0000277	WITHOUT YOU IS FROM JEANNIE'S SECOND ALBUM ON M G M AFTER LEAVING PLANTATION RECORDS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY-TWO IN WHAT SHELBY SINGLETON CALLED A BREACH OF CONTRACT
POD1000000019_S0000291	A K A THE EXACT OPPOSITE AUDIENCE OF THE ONLY REASON ANYONE KNOWS JEANNIE C RILEY'S NAME HARPER VALLEY P T A A SONG HIGHLY CRITICAL OF HYPOCRISY IN SOCIAL GROUPS WITH HARDCORE CONSERVATIVE VALUES
POD1000000019_S0000301	NEXT MOVE ASK TOM T HALL TO WRITE ANOTHER HARPER VALLEY P T A A THING HE'D BEEN VERY VOCAL ABOUT HIS RELUCTANCE TO DO BUT ALSO HE'S A BIG SOFTIE
POD1000000019_S0000355	AND THAT DISCLAIMER IS WRITTEN BY JEANNIE'S CO-AUTHOR WHO I ALSO FEEL THE MANSION IS A PREACHER HERE'S WHAT HE WRITES QUOTE TO KEEP FROM HURTING SOME OF THE FOLKS JEANNIE LOVES WE HAVE CHANGED THE NAMES OF SEVERAL PEOPLE IN THE BOOK
POD1000000019_S0000374	ONE THING THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING THAT WE HEARD TODAY IS UNLIKE AS YOU HEARD IN THE SECOND EPISODE OF THE PODCAST LORETTA'S RECORDING OF THE PILL
POD1000000019_S0000378	I THINKS MONEY TALKS I THINK THAT BY THE TIME ANY OF THOSE WOULD BE BUZZ KILLS STARTED PAYING ATTENTION THIS SONG WAS ALREADY THE NUMBER ONE POP SONG IN AMERICA AND IT WENT NUMBER ONE POP BEFORE IT WENT NUMBER ONE COUNTRY
POD1000000019_S0000379	EVERY MAJOR RECORD LABEL IN NASHVILLE HAD BEEN FALLING ALL OVER ITSELF FOR FIFTEEN YEARS TRYING TO DO THAT THEY HAVE MADE JEANNIE C RILEY THE MAYOR OF NASHVILLE IF SHE DID IT A SECOND TIME
POD1000000019_S0000387	THEN TWO YEARS LATER IN NINETEEN SEVENTY-ONE AS JEANNIE STATED IN THE BOOK AH THIS IS REALLY AGGRAVATING FOR ME TO HAVE TO TALK ABOUT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THIS IS JUST MY FAULT
POD1000000021_S0000006	THAT'S TRINA EDWARDS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HER HUSBAND EDWIN EDWARDS THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF LOUISIANA
POD1000000021_S0000018	EDWARDS SERVED EIGHT YEARS ON CORRUPTION CHARGES
POD1000000021_S0000042	THERE WERE SIX GRAND JURY INVESTIGATIONS DURING EDWARDS'S FIRST TERM
POD1000000021_S0000046	EDWARDS LED LOUISIANA FOR EIGHT YEARS LEAVING OFFICE IN MARCH NINETEEN EIGHTY
POD1000000021_S0000047	THE ONLY THING STOPPING HIM FROM BEING GOVERNOR FOR LIFE FOR TERM LIMITS THAT EDWARDS HIMSELF HAD PUSHED FOR
POD1000000021_S0000058	EDWARDS WAS RIGHT TO BELIEVE THAT NINETEEN EIGHTY-THREE ELECTION WAS A LOCK HE'D WIN IT WITH SIXTY-TWO PERCENT OF THE VOTE
POD1000000021_S0000061	IF THERE'S ONE THING LOUISIANA GOVERNOR ELECT EDWIN EDWARDS KNOWS IT'S HOW TO HAVE A GOOD TIME EVEN WITH A FOUR MILLION DOLLAR CAMPAIGN DEFICIT STARING HIM DOWN
POD1000000021_S0000062	EDWARDS CHARTERED TWO JUMBO JETS ANNOUNCED HE WAS GOING TO PARIS AND INVITED ANYONE WILLING TO CONTRIBUTE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO COME ON ALONG
POD1000000021_S0000096	WHEN I ASKED EDWARDS ABOUT THE CASE HE DIDN'T SOUND ALL THAT SORRY
POD1000000021_S0000111	BUDDY ROEMER WAS A CONGRESSMAN FROM NORTH LOUISIANA
POD1000000021_S0000121	THERE WOULD BE NO RUNOFF ROMER WOULD BE THE NEXT GOVERNOR OF LOUISIANA
POD1000000021_S0000123	BUT THAT'S NOT HOW EDWARDS SAW IT DROPPING OUT OF THE RACE THAT WAS THE FIRST STEP IN HIS COMEBACK PLAN
POD1000000021_S0000133	IN NINETEEN NINETY-ONE DAVID DUKE WAS AT THE HEIGHT OF HIS POWERS

POD1000000021_S0000167	IN REALITY DUKE'S BRAND OF POPULISM HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH SHRINKING GOVERNMENT
POD1000000021_S0000169	DUKE'S MESSAGE THE JOURNALIST JOHN MCGINNIS WROTE HELD A LOT OF APPEAL FOR THE CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN OF HUEY LONG'S OLD VOTERS
POD1000000021_S0000172	THEY WANT TO SEE WHERE HUEY LONG WAS SHOT AND WHERE DAVID DUKE SAYS
POD1000000021_S0000181	ROEMER'S BIG INITIATIVE WAS A PLAN TO MODERNIZE THE STATE'S APPROACH TO TAXATION
POD1000000021_S0000184	ROMER WAS ADAMANT THAT HIS FISCAL REFORM PLAN WAS NOT A TAX INCREASE
POD1000000021_S0000187	DAVID DUKE THEN A NEWLY ELECTED STATE LEGISLATOR WAS ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S MOST OUTSPOKEN CRITICS
POD1000000021_S0000197	DIGGING LOUISIANA'S ALREADY TROUBLED ECONOMY EVER DEEPER IN DEBT AND FORCING REFORM MINDED GOVERNOR BUDDY ROEMER TO SCRAMBLE HIS WAY OUT OF A NEW FINANCIAL CRISIS

POD1000000021_S0000225	IN HIS STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS ROMER APOLOGIZED TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR HIS INFLEXIBILITY AND INSENSITIVITY
POD1000000021_S0000228	FOR STROTHER THE SELF-HELP STUFF WAS BAD BUT WHAT HAPPENED NEXT WAS WORSE
POD1000000021_S0000231	I SAW MARY MADELIN A WHOLE BUNCH OF HIGH ECHELON REPUBLICANS SITTING AROUND A TABLE WITH BUD BY THE DINING ROOM TABLE WITH BUDDY
POD1000000021_S0000242	IDEOLOGY ASIDE ROMER THOUGHT THE MOVE WAS SMART STRATEGY
POD1000000021_S0000243	EDWIN EDWARDS WAS GOING TO GRAB VOTES FROM HIS LEFT NO MATTER WHAT
POD1000000021_S0000244	ROMER FIGURED THAT BRANDING HIMSELF A REPUBLICAN WOULD HELP STAVE OFF RIGHT WING CHALLENGERS WHO MIGHT THREATEN HIS RE-ELECTION
POD1000000021_S0000245	THE STATEWIDE POLLS SHOWED THAT THE TOP THREE CANDIDATES ARE DUKE EDWARDS AND MYSELF
POD1000000021_S0000250	DEMOCRATS IN LOUISIANA FELT BURNED BY ROMER AND REPUBLICANS INCLUDING STATE PARTY OFFICIALS WEREN'T SURE THEY COULD TRUST HIM EITHER
POD1000000021_S0000252	RESENTED THAT ROMER HADN'T INCLUDED HIM IN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE PARTY SWITCH AND ROMER FORGETTING THE LESSONS OF ALL I EVER NEEDED TO KNOW I LEARNED IN KINDERGARTEN CURSED OUT NUNGESSER RATHER THAN TRYING TO APPEASE HIM
POD1000000021_S0000254	THAT ENDORSEMENT WOULDN'T GO TO BUDDY ROEMER OR DAVID DUKE
POD1000000021_S0000260	THEN DUKE WAS EGGING THEM ON YOU KNOW TO DISRUPT THINGS
POD1000000021_S0000263	BUDDY ROEMER HAD TRIED TO CONSOLIDATE THE CONSERVATIVE VOTE
POD1000000021_S0000296	BY NINETEEN NINETY-ONE THE OPEN PRIMARY WAS OPEN IN A WAY EDWARDS MAYBE HADN'T ANTICIPATED
POD1000000021_S0000305	DUKE COULD PASS THE BUCKET WITH IMPUNITY DURING HIS NINETEEN NINETY SENATE CAMPAIGN BECAUSE THAT WAS A FEDERAL RACE
POD1000000021_S0000307	HAMSTRUNG BY THESE NEW RULES DUKE HELD FEWER RALLIES AS A CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR THAN WHEN HE RAN FOR THE SENATE AND EDWARDS'S FUNDRAISING SLOWED TO A TRICKLE
POD1000000021_S0000312	RAYMOND STROTHER SAW IT UP CLOSE DURING THE NINETEEN EIGHTY-SEVEN RACE
POD1000000021_S0000326	THE PROBLEM FOR ROMER WAS THAT A LOT OF SWING VOTERS FELT DRAWN TO ANOTHER CANDIDATE
POD1000000021_S0000343	IT WASN'T CLEAR BASED ON POLLING HOW WHITE PEOPLE IN LOUISIANA WERE RESPONDING TO DUKE'S LATEST ATTEMPT AT IMAGE MANAGEMENT
POD1000000021_S0000344	SUSAN HOWELL HAD BEEN STRUGGLING FOR YEARS TO GET A HANDLE ON DUKE'S VOTERS
POD1000000021_S0000355	THIS BECAME A RESEARCH CHALLENGE FOR HOWELL AND HER GRADUATE STUDENTS HOW COULD THEY GET DAVID DUKE SILENT ARMY TO BREAK ITS SILENCE

POD1000000021_S0000407	WHEN I ASKED EDWARDS ABOUT THE ALLIANCE HE TOLD ME HE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT
POD1000000021_S0000408	IN JOHN MCGINNISS'S BOOK ABOUT THE NINETEEN NINETY-ONE CAMPAIGN CLYDE HOLLOWAY'S CAMPAIGN ADVISOR BRIAN WAGNER ALSO DENIED MAKING ANY SUCH DEAL
POD1000000021_S0000421	HE ALSO THINKS EDWARDS IS TOTALLY CORRUPT
POD1000000021_S0000423	I'M NOT SAYING IT'S IMMORAL IT'S JUST AMORAL COMPLETELY WITHOUT REGARD TO THE MORALITY OF TRYING TO HELP DAVID DUKE GET INTO THE RUNOFF AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT WOULD BE GOOD OR BAD FOR THE STATE OF LOUISIANA
POD1000000021_S0000430	BUT WHAT IF THEY WERE WRONG WHAT IF DAVID DUKE WON
POD1000000021_S0000446	ON OCTOBER NINETEENTH NINETEEN NINETY-ONE DUKE'S FANS GATHERED AT THE PONTCHARTRAIN CENTER IN HIS HOME TERRITORY OF JEFFERSON PARISH

POD1000000023_S0000011	AND KANT GOES MORE IN THE DIRECTION OF A PRIORI FACT DERIVED FROM REASON BUT EITHER WAY THESE THINKERS ARE IN THEIR OWN WAY TRYING TO USE REASON TO ARRIVE AT A UNIVERSAL THAT GUARANTEES HUMAN BEINGS ARE BORN WITH NATURAL RIGHTS
POD1000000023_S0000026	BUT RORTY WOULD EXTEND THAT TUTELAGE TO THE RATIONAL DOGMA THAT WAS TO COME IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE OF HOW OVER-AMBITIOUS WE WERE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT ABOUT WHAT RATIONALITY COULD PRODUCE
POD1000000023_S0000031	THIS WASN'T AN ANTI-ENLIGHTENMENT IDEA AT ALL TO RORTY THIS WAS THE PROJECT OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT LEFT TO PLAY ITSELF OUT
POD1000000023_S0000038	MAYBE IT IS POINTLESS TO TRY TO DO OUR BEST IMPRESSIONS OF LOCKE AND KANT AND TRY TO ACCESS THE UNIVERSE THROUGH REASON
POD1000000023_S0000048	BUT TO RORTY THIS WOULD BE MAKING THE SAME MISTAKE THAT LOCKE AND KANT MADE IN OUR EXAMPLE FROM BEFORE ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS

YOU1000000007_S0000027	HEY JASON I AM HERE TO INSIST YOU WITH GETTING YOU IN THE MOST ACCURATE VALUE OF YOUR HOME COUPLE OF QUICK QUESTIONS FOR YOUR REALTOR OR YOUR WORK WITH REALTOR SO NOW WHAT WE DO IS WE JUST HIT NEXT
YOU1000000019_S0000002	THE CUBE WAS DESIGNED BY QIYI MOFANGGE AND WAS APPROVED BY MATS VALK OF COURSE THE CUBE IS HIS MAIN BUT LET'S SEE HOW THE CUBE ACTUALLY PERFORMS AND WHETHER IT'S RIGHT FOR YOU
YOU1000000021_S0000004	THE D M W IS A CONTINUOUSLY SPINNING SLOT MACHINE SYSTEM THAT CONFERS VARIOUS BONUSES EFFECTS AND ATTACKS BASED ON THE RESULTS INCLUDING HOW ZACK LEVELS UP
YOU1000000021_S0000007	THE GAME BEGINS WITH ZACK FAIR SOLDIER SECOND CLASS OF THE GROUP CALLED SOLDIER A PRIVATE MILITARY ARMY OWNED BY THE SHINRA ELECTRIC POWER COMPANY IN THE CITY OF MIDGAR
YOU1000000021_S0000009	ZACK HAS TREMENDOUS SKILLS AND TALENT BUT IS UNFORTUNATELY A LITTLE OVER CONFIDENT RECKLESS AT TIMES AS POINTED OUT BY HIS FELLOW SOLDIER ANOTHER FIRST CLASS NAMED SEPHIROTH
YOU1000000021_S0000011	ANGEAL HELPS HIM OUT REMINDING HIM TO TEMPER HIS ASPIRATIONS WITH PASSIONATE DREAMS AND STEADFAST HONOR
YOU1000000021_S0000012	ZACK HEARS FROM A FELLOW SOLDIER OF THE MASS DESERTION OF TROOPS IN SOLDIER AND HE'S SOON CALLED IN TO SPEAK WITH THE DIRECTOR OF SOLDIER A MAN NAMED LAZARD
YOU1000000021_S0000019	SUDDENLY ANGEAL GOES MISSING AND SEPHIROTH SUSPECTS HE TOO HAS BETRAYED THEM AND DESERTED THOUGH ZACK FERVENTLY DENIES IT
YOU1000000021_S0000020	AFTER THE MISSION DIRECTOR LAZARD CONFIRMS ANGEAL REALLY IS GONE FOR UNKNOWN REASONS BUT ASSIGNS ZACK ON A NEW MISSION
YOU1000000021_S0000027	FINDING ANGEAL'S MOTHER GILLIAN SHE NOTES ZACK IS THE RESTLESS PUPPY ANGEAL OFTEN SPOKE ABOUT AND SHE TELLS HIM GENESIS CAME BY A MONTH AGO WITH AN ARMY OF MINIONS AND PROCEEDED TO START KILLING TOWNSFOLK
YOU1000000021_S0000045	AS SEPHIROTH TALKS MORE WITH ZACK HE ELABORATES MORE HOW ANGEAL GENESIS AND HIMSELF WERE CLOSE FRIENDS AND EVEN THOUGH SEPHIROTH HIMSELF WAS THE COMPANY'S PRIZED WAR HERO GENESIS HIMSELF WANTED SUCH PRESTIGE AS WELL
YOU1000000021_S0000048	SURVEYING THE MONSTER SEPHIROTH DEDUCES THE DUO ARE IN LEAGUE WITH DOCTOR HOLLANDER WHICH TIES INTO THE STORY HE JUST TOLD
YOU1000000021_S0000054	HOLLANDER HIMSELF APPEARS HE'S SURPRISED TO SEE THEM BUT EXPLAINS ONLY HE CAN STOP GENESIS'S DEGRADATION AFTER WHICH GENESIS HIMSELF APPEARS AND EXPLAINS HOLLANDER WON'T BE CAPTURED
YOU1000000021_S0000063	SHE IS NATURALLY SURPRISED AND ACTUALLY LIKES HIS UNIQUE EYES TO WHICH ZACK CONTINUES TO FLIRT SHOWING OFF THE TRADEMARK MAKO INFUSED EYES OF A SOLDIER
YOU1000000021_S0000069	LATER ZACK GOES TO VISIT AERITH WHEN TSENG HALTS HIM TO CALL HIM INTO A MISSION TO MODEOHEIM AND GIVES ZACK PAUSE WHEN HE SAYS HE ALSO KNOWS AERITH BUT WON'T ELABORATE
YOU1000000021_S0000072	ZACK IS FROM THE TINY VILLAGE OF GONGAGA AND THIS VILLAGE IS FROM NIBELHEIM WHO INTRODUCES HIMSELF AS CLOUD
YOU1000000021_S0000073	AS THE MISSION FOR HOLLANDER CONTINUES GENESIS MOVES TO KILL HIM AS HE'S ALREADY BEGUN VISIBLY DEGRADING AND CLAIMS HE DOESN'T NEED HOLLANDER ANYMORE
YOU1000000021_S0000076	ON HIS WAY OUT HE IS MET BY ANGEAL AS WELL AS HOLLANDER WHO EXPLAIN THE G IN PROJECT G WAS NOT FOR GENESIS BUT FOR GILLIAN WHO WAS ANGEAL'S MOTHER WHO APPARENTLY TOOK HER OWN LIFE EARLIER IN BANORA
YOU1000000021_S0000077	THE EXPERIMENT WAS TWO FOLD GILLIAN HAD JENOVA CELLS INJECTED INTO HER WHILE SHE WAS PREGNANT WITH ANGEAL AND GENESIS SIMPLY HAD JENOVA CELLS IMPLANTED DIRECTLY INTO HIM AS A TEST TUBE BABY
YOU1000000021_S0000079	REASON BEING ANGEAL CAN USE THE JENOVA CELLS AS A TWO WAY CONDUIT AS INTENDED ANGEAL THEN EXPLAINS HIS CELLS CAN ABSORB GENETIC TRAITS AND PASS THEM TO OTHERS BEYOND WHAT GENESIS CAN MANAGE WHICH IS ONLY IMPRINT THEM ONTO OTHERS
YOU1000000021_S0000082	AFTER WINNING A BITTER VICTORY A DEGRADING ANGEAL IS GRATEFUL THAT ZACK ENDED HIM WITH DIGNITY AND HONOR BEFORE DYING HE PASSES ON HIS FAMILY SWORD AND LEGACY OF HONOR THE BUSTER SWORD TO ZACK
YOU1000000021_S0000088	SHE TEASES HIM ABOUT HIS GIRLFRIEND AERITH AND EXPLAINS SHE'S UNDER CONSTANT TURK SURVEILLANCE AS IT TURNS OUT SHE IS THE LAST LIVING MEMBER OF A RACE CALLED THE ANCIENT
YOU1000000021_S0000089	ZACK IS SURPRISED NOT ONLY TO LEARN THIS BUT ALSO THAT AERITH NEVER TOLD HIM
YOU1000000021_S0000092	AND SO ZACK'S VACATION IS OVER AS THE THREE OF THEM ARE TO INVESTIGATE ATTACK ON JUNON
YOU1000000021_S0000093	IT TURNS OUT MORE GENESIS CLONES WERE ATTACKING AND THIS TIME HOLLANDER WAS EVEN THERE THOUGH HE GETS AWAY ONCE AGAIN
YOU1000000021_S0000095	RETURNING TO AERITH HE FINDS A MONSTER DOG THERE BUT ITS NOT REALLY CAUSING PROBLEMS THOUGH ZACK NOTES ITS ALSO AN ANGEAL COPY AND IT SEEMS KEEN TO PROTECT AERITH
YOU1000000021_S0000101	AS THEIR MISSION IN MENTIONS NOTHING OF THEIR OLD FRIENDS SEPHIROTH PRIVATELY CONFESSES TO ZACK THAT HE'S SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING LEAVING SHINRA AS WELL DEPENDING ON WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS MISSION
YOU1000000021_S0000105	AS THEY ARRIVE SEPHIROTH MAKES SMALL TALK ASKING CLOUD HOW IT FEELS TO BE HOME AGAIN AND TRYING TO RELATE AS HE HAS NO ORIGINAL TOWN AND ALL HE KNOWS IS HIS MOTHER'S NAME TO BE JENOVA WHO DIED AFTER HE WAS BORN
YOU1000000021_S0000106	IN TOWN THEY ARE MET BY A LOCAL TOWN GIRL BY THE NAME OF TIFA
YOU1000000021_S0000107	WHEN TIFA LEARNS HE'S A SOLDIER FIRST CLASS SHE SEEMS SURPRISED BY THE FACT THEY ONLY SENT HIM AND SEPHIROTH AND BEGINS TO ASK SOMETHING ELSE BUT STOPS AND RUNS OFF INSTEAD
YOU1000000021_S0000117	SEPHIROTH COMES TO A HORRIFYING HYPOTHESIS THAT ITS POSSIBLE HE WAS CREATED THE SAME WAY AND IT BECOMES A CRISIS OF IDENTITY IRONICALLY IDENTICAL TO HIS FRIENDS GENESIS AND ANGEAL
YOU1000000021_S0000128	AFTERWARDS CLOUD WISHES HE WERE STRONG LIKE ZACK BUT ZACK WARNS HIM NOT TO GET TANGLED UP WITH SOLDIER
YOU1000000021_S0000132	AN SUDDENLY ON FIRE WITH MANY TOWNSFOLK SLAIN EVEN CLOUD IS BEING ONCE AGAIN AND AROUND THE CORNER IS SEPHIROTH HIMSELF CALMLY STANDING AMIDST THE FLAMES
YOU1000000021_S0000135	CONFRONTING SEPHIROTH ZACK IS IGNORED AS SEPHIROTH INSISTS HIS MOTHER THE ANCIENT WAS THE SUPERIOR RACE AND THEY SHOULD HAVE RULED THE PLANET
YOU1000000021_S0000137	FINALLY FED UP WITH THE CRIMES OF HUMANS AND SHINRA IN PARTICULAR SEPHIROTH SEES WHAT ANGEAL AND GENESIS KEPT WARNING ABOUT AND CHOOSES TO STAND ALONE
YOU1000000021_S0000152	CLOUD SUCCUMBS TO HIS INJURIES NEXT TO ZACK AND AS THEY BOTH PASS OUT DOCTOR HOJO ARRIVES ON THE SCENE AND CHOOSES CLOUD TO BE HIS NEXT TEST SUBJECT
YOU1000000021_S0000156	HOWEVER SHINRA LABELS THEM BOTH FUGITIVE SAMPLES SO THEY FIND THEMSELVES NOW RUNNING FROM THE ARMY AND CASSINI ACTUALLY MANAGES TO CATCH UP TO THEM FIRST
YOU1000000021_S0000157	HE PLEADS WITH HER TO JUST WALK AWAY AS HE KNOWS ITS A TALL ORDER TO ESCAPE THE TURKS BUT CASSINI CHOOSES HER DUTY OVER HER PERSONAL FEELINGS
YOU1000000021_S0000161	HE KNOWS THEY ARE HOJO'S LATEST EXPERIMENTS AND MODIFIED VERSIONS OF JENOVA'S POWER RUNS THROUGH BOTH OF THEM
YOU1000000021_S0000171	ALMOST TO MIDGAR ZACK STOPS TO FINALLY CONFRONT THE FAILED AND TORTURED CREATION OF A JENOVA INFUSED HUMAN WHO CONSIDERS ZACK A PERFECT FUSION OF ANGEAL'S WILL AND SEPHIROTH'S SUPERIOR CELLS
YOU1000000021_S0000185	MEANWHILE TSENG ORDERS CASSINI AND THE OTHER TURKS TO FIND AND SAVE ZACK BEFORE THE ARMY FINDS THEM WHICH CASSINI IS VERY MOTIVATED TO DO
YOU1000000021_S0000186	THOUGH THIS IS A NEAR-TREASONOUS ACTION TSENG IS WILLING TO RISK IT FOR HIS FRIEND AND FOR AERITH'S SAKE
YOU1000000021_S0000188	UNFORTUNATELY THE ARMY INTERCEPTS ZACK FIRST AND ZACK WILLINGLY CHOOSES TO FIGHT AND HONORABLY PROTECT CLOUD DESPITE HIS OWN DESIRE TO RETURN TO AERITH AND SAVE HIMSELF
YOU1000000021_S0000194	AGAINST ALL ODDS ZACK TRIUMPHS IN HIS FINAL STAND BUT HE IS ON HIS LAST LEGS AS SHINRA BEGINS REINFORCING THEIR TROOPS FIRING COUNTLESS BULLETS INTO A RELENTLESS ZACK
YOU1000000021_S0000199	MEANWHILE CLOUD FINALLY WAKES UP AND DRAGS HIMSELF OVER TO ZACK WHO IS STILL BARELY ALIVE AND FORCES A SMILE FOR HIM AND URGES CLOUD TO LIVE ON IN HIS STEAD AS HIS OWN LIVING LEGACY
YOU1000000021_S0000204	AS THE GAME ENDS THE TRAUMA OF THE EVENTS UNFORTUNATELY RESULT IN CLOUD BLOCKING ALL MEMORY OF ZACK DESPITE HIS PROMISE
YOU1000000027_S0000009	ALRIGHT THE NEXT JOURNALING PROMPT IS SOMETHING THAT I LEARNED FROM MY FRIEND KAJAL PANDEY THIS PAST SUNDAY ACTUALLY WE DID A LIVE CHAT TOGETHER ON FACEBOOK IF YOU WANT TO WATCH THAT FULL LIVE CHAT IT'S REALLY AMAZING
YOU1000000033_S0000008	AND I HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE TODAY JESUS SAYS TO EACH ONE OF US I CAME THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE LIFE AND HAVE IT TO THE FULL THE QUESTION IS DO WE WANT IT
YOU1000000033_S0000026	WHEN I WAS TWENTY YEARS OLD NINETEEN SEVENTY-EIGHT MY SISTER CONVINCED ME TO GO TO A CONFERENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME AND I ALWAYS WANTED TO SEE NOTRE DAME TOUCHDOWN JESUS SO I THOUGHT I'LL GO
YOU1000000033_S0000070	AND THEN I AH GOT INVOLVED IN THE CHARISMATIC RENEWAL MOVEMENT AND THEN CARDINAL SUENENS ASKED ME TO MOVE TO BELGIUM SO IT ISN'T LIKE I HAD A PLAN
YOU1000000033_S0000084	WELL I BEGAN WITH RENEWAL MINISTRIES BACK IN ACTUALLY I I KNEW RALPH FOR QUITE A NUMBER OF YEARS AND WE SPOKE AT SOME CONFERENCES TOGETHER AND CERTAINLY HAD SOMEWHAT OF A COMMON MIND
YOU1000000033_S0000085	AND THEN PETER CAME INTO THE PICTURE AS WELL AND THE THREE OF US JUST AT DIFFERENT TIMES COLLABORATING AT AT A CONFERENCE SOMEWHERE WE BEGAN TO SEE THAT WE ALL HAD A KIND OF SIMILAR MESSAGE
YOU1000000033_S0000094	HOW IT ALL BEGAN I DON'T KNOW IF RALPH MENTIONED THIS BUT KIND OF HOW IT ALL BEGAN WAS HE AND I WENT TO AH HEAR A TALK IN DETROIT AT A LARGE CONFERENCE WE CAME TO HEAR ONE SPEAKER AT THIS LARGER CONFERENCE
YOU1000000033_S0000099	AND THEY STARTED PRAYING FOR US WITH RALPH AND I'M JUST KIND OF WATCHING AND AND IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES WHERE I SAW AH THE GIFT OF PROPHECY KIND OF A WORD OF KNOWLEDGE WORKING IN A IN A VERY POWERFUL WAY
YOU1000000033_S0000100	AND THEY STARTED SAYING THINGS ABOUT RALPH AND ABOUT HIS LIFE WHICH THEY COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN THAT WERE INDICATIONS OF HOW GOD HAD WORKED IN HIM AND THE AND WHAT THE LORD WANTED TO DO WITH HIM
YOU1000000033_S0000105	AND SO AFTER IT WAS ALL DONE WE WERE DRIVING HOME AND SAYING WOW WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT YOU KNOW AND THE RALPH SAID JUST SAID YOU KNOW SCRIPTURE IS VERY CLEAR IT SAYS TO NEVER DESPISE PROPHECY BUT TEST EVERYTHING AND CLING TO WHAT IS GOOD
YOU1000000033_S0000154	AND YOU KNOW IT WAS LIKE LIKE TO YOU KNOW OF COURSE SO WE AH WE WENT THERE AND AFTER MASS WHEN HE CAME TO RALPH WHO WAS NEXT TO ME
YOU1000000033_S0000158	AND I KNEW HE DIDN'T WANT THE WHOLE THREE HUNDRED PAGE ANSWER SO I SAID HOLY FATHER I THINK WHAT THE SPIRIT IS SAYING TO THE CHURCH IS JESUS SO HE TOOK MY HAND AND HE SAID JESUS AND I SAID JESUS
YOU1000000033_S0000160	JOHN PAUL SECOND IS OUR PATRON AND ONE OF OUR ONE OF OUR CENTRAL THE CENTRAL PATRON MAYBE OF AH RENEWAL MINISTRIES AND SO HE IS A GREAT INTERCESSOR FOR US WE CONTINUE TO PRAY WE ASK FOR HIS HELP I FEEL HIS PRESENCE ESPECIALLY WHEN I AM ON MISSION INTERNATIONALLY
YOU1000000033_S0000169	AND MORE AND MORE WE'RE LIVING IN THE GROWTH OF AN INTERNATIONAL PAGAN CULTURE THAT IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY HOSTILE TO CHRIST AND THE CHURCH WHERE IS THEIR LOYALTY
YOU1000000033_S0000181	YOU KNOW PETER WHEN YOU'RE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT EVERY DAY AND YOU'RE GETTING UP EVERY DAY AND DOING WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO SOMETIMES YOU DON'T GET THE WHOLE TRAJECTORY OF WHAT GOD'S DONE AND IT IS JUST AMAZING SEE WHAT THE LORD HAS DONE WITH WITH US

YOU1000000033_S0000211	IN THE WORDS OF POPE EMERITUS BENEDICT THE SIXTEENTH MAN IS PUSHING GOD FROM THE HUMAN HORIZON AND AS A RESULT THE LIGHT WHICH COMES FROM GOD IS DISAPPEARING AND HUMANITY IS LOSING ITS BEARINGS

YOU1000000128_S0000011	AH UM IT IS CLOSER TO HOME LET US GET US TO EUROPE AND ONE OF THESE THINGS THAT I'VE SEEN GEORGE DO TIME AND TIME AGAIN IN EUROPE IS SOMETHING THAT ALSO REALLY CORRECT AND THAT IS STANDING UP FOR THE UNDERDOG
YOU1000000128_S0000030	THAT'S WHEN IRANIAN GENERAL SOLEIMANI WAS ASSASSINATED IN IRAQ
YOU1000000129_S0000008	CARNEGIE IS AT ONE POINT THE RICHEST AMERICAN IN HISTORY BUT HE WASN'T BORN IN AMERICA
YOU1000000129_S0000009	ANDREW'S STORY BEGINS ACROSS THE ATLANTIC OCEAN IN DUNFERMLINE SCOTLAND WHERE HE GREW UP IN WHAT COULD ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS ABJECT POVERTY
YOU1000000129_S0000022	CARNEGIE WOULD PROFIT FROM IT HE WAS ABLE TO ESCAPE HOMS WAY AFTER PAYING EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS FOR A SUBSTITUTE TO TAKE HIS PLACE ON THE BATTLEFIELD IT WAS DURING THIS TIME THE CARNEGIE NOTICED THAT THE WOODEN BRIDGES WERE EASILY BURNED BY THE TROOPS
YOU1000000129_S0000025	OWNING THE IRON SAUCE MEANT THAT CARNEGIE'S BRIDGE BUILDING COMPANY WOULD NOT BE DEPENDENT ON MINING OR EXTRACTING COMPANIES FOR IRON LIKE THEIR COMPETITORS THIS NOT ONLY GAVE CARNEGIE MORE CONTROL OVER THE ENTIRE PROCESS IT ALSO IMPROVED THEIR MARGINS
YOU1000000129_S0000044	HENRY CLAY FRICK AS A TEAM CARNEGIE AND FRICK WERE A POWERFUL FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH AND TO SHOW HOW RUTHLESS THE TWO COULD BE LOOK NO FARTHER THAN THE STORY ABOUT DUQUESNE WORKS
YOU1000000129_S0000059	IN EIGHTEEN NINETY-EIGHT NINE PERCENT OF ALL STEEL WORKERS INDUSTRYWIDE WOULD DIE ON THE JOB WHEN THE WORKERS REFUSED FRICK'S AGGRESSIVE DEMANDS FOR LONGER HOURS AND LESS PAY HE DECIDED TO LOCK OUT ALL EMPLOYEES
YOU1000000129_S0000076	AS THE STORY GOES J P MORGAN GLANCED AT THE OFFER AND WITHOUT HESITATION ACCEPTED IT MORGAN WOULD BUY CARNEGIE STEEL FOR FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS MAKING CARNEGIE THE SINGLE RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD AT THE TIME
YOU1000000129_S0000077	CARNEGIE WOULD COMPLETELY CUT TIES WITH HIS BUSINESS LIFE AND DEDICATE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF HIMSELF TO SERVING THE WORLD THROUGH PHILANTHROPY NOT A SINGLE DOLLAR WILL BE LEFT TO HIS FAMILY
YOU1000000129_S0000078	BECAUSE ANDREW HAD ONLY FIVE YEARS OF SCHOOLING HE HAD A SOFT SPOT FOR LIBRARIES WHICH HE CREDITS FOR HELPING HIM ACHIEVE FINANCIAL SUCCESS HE ACQUIRED
YOU1000000129_S0000080	ONE EXAMPLE OF HIS GENEROSITY IS CARNEGIE HALL ONE OF NEW YORK'S MOST RECOGNIZABLE LANDMARKS BUILT IN EIGHTEEN NINETY-ONE CARNEGIE BUILT AND DONATED THE BUILDING AS THE MUSICAL HALL
YOU1000000129_S0000085	PERHAPS HE VIEWED DONATING HIS MONEY AS A WAY TO ATONE FOR HIS BUSINESS SINS MAKING MONEY IS A GREAT FEELING BUT AN EVEN BETTER FEELING IS GIVING IT AWAY IF YOU WANT TO GROW WEALTH AND PERHAPS DONATE TO NOBLE CAUSES LIKE CARNEGIE DID
YOU1000000130_S0000011	BY THE TIME HENRY HAD BECOME A TEENAGER THE STEAM ENGINE WAS ALREADY MAKING ITS WAY INTO THE FARMING COMMUNITY COAL-POWERED THRESHING MACHINES AND SAWMILLS WERE BECOMING COMMON SIGHT AND HENRY WAS LEARNING HOW THEY WORKED AND HOW TO FIX THEM
YOU1000000130_S0000017	IT IS DURING THIS TIME THAT HENRY BY CHANCE LEARNED ABOUT THE GAS ENGINE FROM A BRITISH MAGAZINE IT WAS BEING PRODUCED IN SMALL NUMBERS BY A GERMAN ENGINEER NIKOLAUS OTTO
YOU1000000130_S0000018	AND IT WAS GAINING SOME TRACTION IN EUROPE BUT IT WAS PRACTICALLY UNHEARD OF IN AMERICA HENRY WOULD GET THE CHANCE TO WORK ON SUCHAN ENGINE HIMSELF IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY-NINE AND HE INSTANTLY RECOGNIZED THE ADVANTAGES IT HAD
YOU1000000130_S0000020	THIS ALSO ALLOWED THE GAS ENGINE TO START QUICKLY WHEREAS STEAM ENGINES OF THE TIME NEEDED AS MUCH AS THIRTY MINUTES TO HEAT UP THE WATER AND GENERATE ENOUGH STEAM TO START WORKING THE GAS ENGINE WAS AN INNOVATION HENRY FELL IN LOVE WITH
YOU1000000130_S0000023	IT WAS GENERATING ELECTRICITY FOR OVER A THOUSAND HOMES IN DETROIT AND IT WAS DOING SO BY USING STEAM ENGINES SO HENRY WAS A NATURAL HIRE FOR THEM WHENEVER THE ENGINES BROKE HENRY HAD TO FIX THEM BUT WHENEVER THEY WERE WORKING
YOU1000000130_S0000029	HE HAD DRIVEN A THOUSAND MILES IN IT HENRY BUILT A SECOND QUADRICYCLE AND THEN A THIRD ONE ALWAYS IMPROVING THE DESIGN BEFORE FINALLY FEELING CONFIDENT ENOUGH IN EIGHTEEN NINETY-NINE TO START HIS OWN COMPANY
YOU1000000130_S0000032	AND EVERYONE WAS EAGER TO SEE WHAT HENRY COULD CREATE WITH PROPER CAPITAL HENRY'S PLAN WAS VERY CLEVER SINCE HE PERSONALLY KNEW MANY OF THE INDUSTRIALISTS IN DETROIT BY THAT POINT HE'D TRY TO BUILD AN AUTOMOBILE THEY COULD USE IN THEIR BUSINESSES
YOU1000000130_S0000033	HE LEASED A FACTORY AND PLANNED TO HIRE A HUNDRED WORKERS TO MAKE HIS NEW DELIVERY WAGON AS HE CALLED IT BUT IT TURNED OUT THAT BUILDING SUCH COMPLEX MACHINES IN HIGH NUMBERS WAS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT THAN HENRY IMAGINED
YOU1000000130_S0000041	HENRY LABELED HIS FIRST DESIGN AS THE MODEL A AND WORKED HIS WAY THROUGH THE ALPHABET OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS SUSTAINED BY CAPITAL FROM HIS FRIENDS AND FAMILY
YOU1000000130_S0000044	THE BIGGEST GAME-CHANGER OF ALL HOWEVER WAS HENRY'S CHANCE VISIT TO A SLAUGHTERHOUSE IN CHICAGO HE SAW THERE SOMETHING INTERESTING A DISASSEMBLY LINE SO TO SPEAK WHERE MULTIPLE WORKERS WOULD PROCESS CARCASSES MOVING DOWN A LINE
YOU1000000130_S0000049	IT IS ACTUALLY DURING THE PRODUCTION OF THIS MODEL THAT HENRY WOULD FIRST USE THE ASSEMBLY LINE PROCESS TO AT LEAST PARTIALLY ASSEMBLE SOME OF HIS CARS
YOU1000000130_S0000060	THEY WOULD HELP HIM TRANSITION HIS ENTIRE MANUFACTURING PROCESS TO USE VANADIUM STEEL IT WAS THEIR CHIEF ENGINEER THAT BUILT THE HEAT TREATMENT PLANT FOR HENRY IN NINETEEN O SEVEN
YOU1000000130_S0000068	HENRY HAD BEGUN A NEW AGE IN AMERICAN HISTORY THE AGE OF THE AUTOMOBILE AND IT WAS HIS COMPANY THAT WOULD TOTALLY DOMINATE IN ITS FIRST TWO DECADES
YOU1000000130_S0000069	IT WASN'T UNTIL THE END OF THE NINETEEN TWENTIES THAT THE REST OF THE AUTO INDUSTRY CAUGHT UP TO HENRY BUT AT THAT POINT HE WAS ALREADY ONE OF THE RICHEST MEN ALIVE
YOU1000000131_S0000005	THE ORIGINS OF HISTORY'S GREATEST OIL MONOPOLY ARE ACTUALLY PRETTY HUMBLE IT ALL STARTS IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY-NINE WITH THE BIRTH OF JOHN ROCKEFELLER IN UPSTATE NEW YORK HE WAS THE ELDEST SON OF A TRAVELLING MERCHANT
YOU1000000131_S0000008	SO THEY COULD ALL LIVE TOGETHER IN THIS VERY CONFUSING HOUSEHOLD JOHN WOULD GROW UP LEARNING HOW TO HUSTLE PEOPLE FOR THE BEST DEAL POSSIBLE AND HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF EVERY PENNY HE GOT HIS FAMILY WOULD RARELY STAY IN ONE PLACE FOR LONG

POD1000000010_S0000064	THAT IS JENNIFER KOTLER SHE'S ONE OF OUR EXPERT GUIDES TODAY THROUGH WHAT TURNS OUT TO BE A PRETTY COMPLICATED SUBJECT
POD1000000010_S0000069	EXHIBIT A IS THIS STUDY JEN POINTS TO OUT OF HARVARD A FEW YEARS BACK
POD1000000010_S0000074	YEAH AND THIS KIND OF LIKE SELF-DELUSION THIS IS JUST ONE OF MANY REASONS SCARLETT WORRIES THAT THIS CULTURE IS CREATING HUGE PROBLEMS
POD1000000010_S0000077	AND OF COURSE HER LIFE IS A REALLY STARK REMINDER CORY OF JUST HOW HIGH THE STAKES CAN BE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THINGS LIKE MENTAL HEALTH AND KIDS WHO ARE TROUBLED
POD1000000010_S0000080	AFTER SHE READ THAT MESSAGE FROM JESSE SCARLETT LEWIS REACHED OUT TO A TEAM OF RESEARCHERS AND EDUCATORS AND SHE CREATED A PLAN TO ESSENTIALLY TEACH CHILDREN KINDNESS STEP BY STEP VALUE BY VALUE
POD1000000010_S0000081	YEAH THE JESSE LEWIS CHOOSE LOVE ENRICHMENT PROGRAM THEY ESTIMATE IT'S NOW REACHED OVER A MILLION STUDENTS
POD1000000010_S0000085	SO LET'S FOLLOW SCARLETT'S LEAD AND SESAME STREET'S AND TALK ABOUT HOW THE SCIENCE OF KINDNESS CAN TRANSLATE INTO ACTION
POD1000000010_S0000095	THOMAS LICKONA SAYS WE SEE SIGNS OF WHAT IS CALLED EMPATHIC DISTRESS EVEN IN TINY BABIES
POD1000000010_S0000098	AND TOM TOLD US THAT BABIES MORAL SENSE SEEMS TO GO EVEN DEEPER
POD1000000010_S0000100	SO THIS IS LIKE I WAS SAYING CORY I ALWAYS THOUGHT KIDS ARE JUST BORN TO BE KIND
POD1000000010_S0000103	ONLY ABOUT A THIRD OF THE KIDS ACTUALLY RESPONDED IN THAT MOMENT WITH ALTRUISM WITH KINDNESS BY SAY GOING OVER TO THE CHILD OFFERING A HUG CALLING FOR AN ADULT
POD1000000010_S0000104	ZACHARY
POD1000000010_S0000106	LET'S CHECK ON HIM BELLA HE'S TRYING TO CHECK ON YOU
POD1000000010_S0000109	I'M GONNA HELP BELLA
POD1000000010_S0000112	LET ME HELP YOU BELLA
POD1000000010_S0000138	AND THAT'S WHY SCARLETT SAYS
POD1000000010_S0000144	THE JESSE LEWIS CHOOSE LOVE PROGRAM FOR KIDS FROM PRE-K THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL ACTUALLY BEGINS WITH COURAGE
POD1000000010_S0000145	AND I WANNA MENTION THAT REPORTS OF THE SHOOTING SAID THAT JESSE HIMSELF SHOWED INCREDIBLE COURAGE
POD1000000010_S0000147	YEAH AND SCARLETT'S DEFINITION OF COURAGE IS EVEN BIGGER THAN THAT SORT OF
POD1000000010_S0000154	IT'S ALSO SCARLETT SAYS THE COURAGE TO STAND UP TO SOMEONE WHO'S BULLYING YOU OR SOMEONE YOU KNOW BY TAKING THEIR PERSPECTIVE AND SEEING THE WORLD THROUGH THEIR EYES
POD1000000010_S0000160	YOU KNOW HEARING ABOUT COURAGE IN THAT WAY IN THAT MOMENT REALLY SPOKE TO ME CORY BECAUSE I HAVE TO ADMIT THIS
POD1000000010_S0000161	I WAS A LITTLE AFRAID TO SIT DOWN WITH SCARLETT
POD1000000010_S0000165	ONE REALLY PRACTICAL WAY SCARLETT'S CHOOSE LOVE PLAN BUILDS COURAGE IS BY TEACHING KIDS TO STAY CALM
POD1000000010_S0000170	JEN KOTLER AT SESAME SAYS IF YOU'RE MORE AWARE OF YOUR EMOTIONS YOU'LL ALSO BE MORE AWARE OF EVERYONE ELSE'S
POD1000000010_S0000186	YEAH BEFORE JEN STARTED AT SESAME WORKSHOP SHE SPENT HER DAYS IN A CLASSROOM
POD1000000010_S0000190	THE PROBLEM JEN FOUND OUT WITH FORCED APOLOGIES AS THAT THEY'RE USUALLY PRETTY WORTHLESS
POD1000000010_S0000193	YEAH SO TOM LICKONA AND JEN KOTLER BOTH TOLD US INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON KIDS PARROTING THE WORDS SORRY
POD1000000010_S0000196	JEN SAYS YOU CAN ACTUALLY TAKE A MOMENT LIKE THIS
POD1000000010_S0000200	JEN SAYS SESAME STREET HAS IMPROVED OVER TIME IN HOW IT DEPICTS APOLOGIES ON THE SHOW
POD1000000010_S0000202	SO ELMO MIGHT SAY I WAS REALLY WANTING TO PLAY WITH MY SCOOTER AND I DIDN'T WANT TO SHARE IT
POD1000000010_S0000206	YOU'LL GET IT ZOE
POD1000000010_S0000207	BUT BUT BUT WAIT WHAT ABOUT YOUR TURN ELMO
POD1000000010_S0000208	ELMO ELMO CAN BE PATIENT AND WAIT FOR HIS TURN
POD1000000010_S0000209	SO WHAT DO YOU SAY ZOE
POD1000000010_S0000214	ALL RIGHT NICE JOB SHARING ELMO
POD1000000010_S0000228	YOU HURT AMY
POD1000000010_S0000231	TOM ALSO SAYS THAT CHILDREN SHOULD LEARN TO MAKE AN APOLOGY OF ACTION
POD1000000010_S0000236	AND SCARLETT LEWIS SAYS THAT MEANS WHEN PARENTS SCREW UP WE NEED TO APOLOGIZE TOO
POD1000000010_S0000240	IF ANYTHING SCARLETT TALKS EVEN MORE ABOUT THE OTHER SIDE OF AN APOLOGY FORGIVENESS
POD1000000010_S0000250	I LOVE THIS TOO BECAUSE SCARLETT IS REALLY FOCUSING ON THE BENEFIT OF LETTING GO OF ANGER
POD1000000010_S0000252	AND IT WAS AT THIS POINT WHERE SITTING WITH SCARLETT IN HER KITCHEN HER BACK IS TO HER REFRIGERATOR WHICH IS COVERED WITH PHOTOS OF JESSE AND HER OTHER SON J T AND WE JUST HAD TO ASK
POD1000000010_S0000268	AIJA SIMMONS HELPS RUN THE SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL PROGRAMS FOR SCHOOLS IN OAKLAND CALIFORNIA
POD1000000010_S0000277	TOM LICKONA SAYS IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT CELEBRATING KIND ACTIONS
POD1000000010_S0000281	YEAH PART OF HOW SCARLETT KEEPS GOING SHE TOLD US IS BY CONSTANTLY REMINDING HERSELF EVEN OUT LOUD WHAT SHE'S GRATEFUL FOR
POD1000000010_S0000285	AND TOM AGREES
POD1000000010_S0000302	THAT'S A GREAT POINT CORY I'VE GOT TO TRY THAT
POD1000000010_S0000306	YEAH IN FACT SCARLETT LEWIS SAYS
POD1000000010_S0000308	AND SIMILARLY TOM SAYS KINDNESS AS A VIRTUE ISN'T RANDOM IT'S A HABIT
POD1000000010_S0000313	SO TOM SAYS YOU KNOW NOT FOR AN ALLOWANCE BUT JUST TO GIVE THE MESSAGE THAT THIS IS WHAT WE DO TO HELP OUT BECAUSE WE'RE PART OF SOMETHING BIGGER
POD1000000010_S0000314	AND FOR MY DAUGHTER LULU WHO'S SEVEN THAT CHORE AH REALLY IS TAKING CARE OF THE CAT
POD1000000010_S0000322	AND HERE'S THE REALLY GOOD NEWS TOM TOLD US

POD1000000017_S0000019	STEAL AWAY BY ROBBIE DUPREE
POD1000000017_S0000031	I'M HEARING THINGS LIKE ROSANNA BY TOTO
POD1000000017_S0000041	THERE IS SOMETHING JAZZ LIKE IN THE SYNCOPATED MUSIC OF SOMETHING LIKE STEELY DAN
POD1000000017_S0000043	YOU CAN HEAR IN SOMEBODY LIKE MICHAEL MCDONALD
POD1000000017_S0000049	AND THE SONG IN WHICH I AM HEARING IT THE DEEPEST AND STRONGEST AND MOST POWERFULLY AT LEAST TO ME STANDING IN THAT KITCHEN CHOPPING THOSE VEGETABLES WAS WHEN KENNY LOGGINS'S THIS IS IT COMES ON
POD1000000017_S0000053	SURE KENNY LOGGINS IS BASICALLY SING-WHISPERING THE VERSES IN THIS SONG
POD1000000017_S0000058	AND THEN IN THE PRE-CHORUS KENNY LOGGINS DISAPPEARS AND WHO SHOWS UP MICHAEL MCDONALD
POD1000000017_S0000060	GIVING KENNY LOGGINS PLENTY OF TIME TO GATHER HIMSELF
POD1000000017_S0000066	SCRAPING THE PAN IS THE BLACKEST THING YOU CAN DO AS A SINGER AND HERE IS KENNY LOGGINS AS THIS WHITE ARTIST DOING IT
POD1000000017_S0000078	I'M THINKING ABOUT AMY WINEHOUSE
POD1000000017_S0000080	I'M THINKING ABOUT ANNIE LENNOX
POD1000000017_S0000082	I'M THINKING ABOUT GEORGE MICHAEL
POD1000000017_S0000084	I THINK ABOUT CHRIS STAPLETON
POD1000000017_S0000087	AND ONE OF THE MANY PHASES IN WHICH DAVID BOWIE REALLY WANTED TO MAKE R AND B AND SOUL MUSIC
POD1000000017_S0000089	THIS IS THE SOUND NOT JUST OF BLACK AMERICA BUT THE SOUND OF AMERICA IT IS DEEPLY AMERICAN ALMOST ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S SUNG BY BRITISH PEOPLE LIKE DAVID BOWIE AND ANNIE LENNOX AND AMY WINEHOUSE
POD1000000017_S0000103	AND THEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE LIKE BILLY MCCREA
POD1000000017_S0000114	IT'S WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE HEARD PASSING A BLACK PERSON DOING HIS JOB ENTERTAINING HIMSELF DOING THE DRUDGERY OF WORK THE WAY A GUY NAMED THOMAS DARTMOUTH RICE DID SOMETIME AROUND THE EIGHTEEN THIRTIES
POD1000000017_S0000116	ONE DAY HE'S TOURING WITH A TROUPE IN CINCINNATI OR MAYBE IT WAS PITTSBURGH WE DON'T REALLY KNOW BUT THE MYTH BASICALLY GOES T D RICE HAPPENED UPON AN OLD BLACK MAN CLEANING A HORSE IN A STABLE
POD1000000017_S0000117	THE MAN WAS DOING HIS JOB ON PROPERTY OWNED BY A WHITE MAN NAMED CROW
POD1000000017_S0000122	WHATEVER RICE HEARS COMING OUT OF THIS MAN'S MOUTH IS CAPTIVATING TO HIM AND WHAT HE SEES IS AN OPPORTUNITY
POD1000000017_S0000133	AND SO WHEN T D RICE HEARS THIS BLACK MAN SINGING THIS SONG AND MOVING HIS BODY IN THIS PARTICULAR WAY DING A LIGHT BULB GOES OFF
POD1000000017_S0000140	COME LISTEN ALL YOU GALS AND BOYS I'M JUST FROM TUCKAHOE I'M GOING TO SING A LITTLE SONG MY NAME'S JIM CROW
POD1000000017_S0000142	AND THE LYRICS GIVE THE HORSE GROOMER A NAME AND THE NAME IS JIM CROW
POD1000000017_S0000146	THIS IS THE FIRST TIME A PAYING AUDIENCE IS BASICALLY ELECTRIFIED BY A WHITE MAN WITH A BLACK FACE THIS IS THE NIGHT THAT JIM CROW WAS ALLEGEDLY INTRODUCED TO AMERICA THIS MASCOT OF AMERICAN RACISM
POD1000000017_S0000148	AND HERE IS THOMAS DARTMOUTH RICE GIVING IT TO THEM THIS IS THE NIGHT THAT AMERICAN POPULAR CULTURE WAS BORN
POD1000000017_S0000151	SO YOU HAVE OTHER MINSTREL ACTS WHO COME ALONG AND TRY TO DO WHAT THOMAS DARTMOUTH RICE IS DOING A SONG AND A DANCE
POD1000000017_S0000175	SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE HAVING THESE DREAMS GO ON TO BECOME PEOPLE LIKE STEPHEN FOSTER
POD1000000017_S0000177	STEPHEN FOSTER THE MAN WIDELY CREDITED AS BEING THE FATHER OF AMERICAN MUSIC
POD1000000017_S0000197	F E MILLER AND SCATMAN CROTHERS
POD1000000017_S0000210	D W GRIFFITH'S THE BIRTH OF A NATION FULL OF WHITE MEN VILLAINOUSLY IN BLACKFACE
POD1000000017_S0000220	JUDY GARLAND PERFORMED IN BLACKFACE
POD1000000017_S0000222	BING CROSBY AND FRED ASTAIRE BOTH PERFORMED IN BLACKFACE
POD1000000017_S0000227	OUT OF THESE RECORDINGS YOU HAVE PEOPLE LIKE MUDDY WATERS
POD1000000017_S0000237	YOU HAVE THE ADVENT OF A PLACE LIKE BLUE NOTE RECORDS WHERE LOTS OF AMAZING JAZZ WAS CREATED AND THEN RELEASED INTO THE WORLD PEOPLE LIKE SIDNEY BECHET
POD1000000017_S0000239	AND THEN LOUIS ARMSTRONG
POD1000000017_S0000241	AND DUKE ELLINGTON
POD1000000018_S0000000	WHEN ANDY GRIFFITH PASSED AWAY IN TWENTY TWELVE C N N COVERED HIS DEATH OFF AND ON THE ENTIRE DAY
POD1000000018_S0000003	LARRY KING IS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO CALLED IN TO TALK THAT DAY HE'D HAD ANDY ON HIS VARIOUS SHOWS NUMEROUS TIMES AND HE MENTIONED SOMETHING IN PASSING THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING
POD1000000018_S0000005	WHAT LARRY SAID IS THAT A LAWYER NAMED PERCY FOREMAN WAS THE MAN WHO INSPIRED THE CHARACTER MATLOCK
POD1000000018_S0000007	THIS WAS A WEIRD THING FOR ANYONE TO SAY BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE EVEN TODAY BELIEVE THAT CHARACTER TO BE BASED ON A DIFFERENT LAWYER NAMED BOBBY LEE COOK
POD1000000018_S0000009	HOWEVER IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THREE YEARS AFTER LARRY KING SAID SOMETHING THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD ASSUME WAS INCORRECT THE CREATOR OF MATLOCK DID CONFIRM THAT THE CHARACTER WAS BASED ON PERCY FOREMAN
POD1000000018_S0000012	PERCY WAS ABLE TO ACHIEVE THIS RECORD BY BEING AN INCREDIBLE LAWYER NO DENYING IT BUT ALSO DUE TO THE TEXAS COURT SYSTEM'S PRACTICE OF USING JURIES TO DETERMINE GUILT AS WELL AS SENTENCING IN THE CASE OF A GUILTY VERDICT
POD1000000018_S0000016	PERCY HAD TWELVE AVERAGE CITIZENS FROM THE LOCAL COMMUNITY SITTING RIGHT THERE WAITING TO BE CONVINCED THAT THE VICTIM IN THIS SITUATION WASN'T A VICTIM AT ALL
POD1000000018_S0000019	FOREMAN CALLED IT MISDEMEANOR MURDER THAT'S WHERE A JURY MIGHT CONVICT YOU OF ENDING ANOTHER PERSON'S LIFE AND SEND YOU ON YOUR WAY WITH THE TYPE OF PUNISHMENT YOU'D RECEIVE FOR A MISDEMEANOR CRIME
POD1000000018_S0000021	PERCY FOREMAN HAD SUCH A LONG RUN OF WINS WITH THIS STRATEGY THAT IT'S STILL BEING USED IN TEXAS TODAY PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS SORT OF THING WILL SOMETIMES REFER TO IT AS THE TEXAS DEFENSE
POD1000000018_S0000023	NOW JIM DENNY WASN'T FROM TEXAS HE WAS FROM TENNESSEE
POD1000000018_S0000025	WHEN A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD JIM DENNY GOT HIRED TO WORK THE MAILROOM OF W S M RADIO'S PARENT COMPANY HE MUST HAVE SEEN IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF HIMSELF
POD1000000018_S0000027	DENNY GOT THIS JOB IN NINETEEN TWENTY-SEVEN THAT YEAR THE YOUNG RADIO PROGRAM W S M BARN DANCE WAS REFERRED TO AS THE GRAND OLE OPRY FOR THE FIRST TIME ON AIR
POD1000000018_S0000029	EVERY TIME AN ODD JOB CAME UP AT THE OPRY JIM WOULD TAKE IT SO HE COULD HANG OUT BACKSTAGE SEE THE ARTISTS AND SEE HOW THE SHOW WAS MADE
POD1000000018_S0000030	WITHIN TWENTY YEARS DENNY HAD WORKED HIS WAY UP TO DIRECTOR OF THE ARTISTS SERVICE BUREAU AT W S M WHICH MEANT HE WAS IN CHARGE OF BOOKING THE ACTS ON THE OPRY
POD1000000018_S0000032	THERE'S A FEW FUNNY THINGS FROM JIM DENNY'S TIME AT THE GRAND OLE OPRY LIKE THE ONE ABOUT ELVIS PRESLEY'S BIG DEBUT
POD1000000018_S0000033	ELVIS WAS STILL A TEENAGER WHEN DENNY DID SAM PHILLIPS THE FAVOR OF LETTING ELVIS COME ON THE SHOW TO PLAY HIS NOT-COUNTRY ARRANGEMENT OF BLUE MOON OF KENTUCKY
POD1000000018_S0000035	IT DIDN'T GO WELL DENNY IS RUMORED WHO HAVE TOLD ELVIS BACKSTAGE YOU AIN'T GOING NOWHERE SON YOU OUGHT TO GO BACK TO DRIVING A TRUCK
POD1000000018_S0000037	DENNY'S ALSO THE GUY WHO FIRED HANK WILLIAMS OVER THE TELEPHONE AND THERE'S THE TIME WHEN JIM MADE JOHNNY CASH WAIT OUTSIDE HIS OFFICE FOR TWO HOURS BEFORE LETTING HIM IN TO ASK WHY CASH SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO PLAY ON THE OPRY
POD1000000018_S0000039	CASH MENTIONED THAT HE PRESENTLY HAD A SONG CALLED I WALK THE LINE IN THE TOP TEN
POD1000000018_S0000041	JIM DENNY WAS WHAT MANY PEOPLE REFERRED TO IN THOSE TIMES AS A HARD MAN TODAY I THINK THEY'D HAVE SOME DIFFERENT WORDS FOR HIM AND THAT'S WHY ERNEST TUBB TRIED TO SHOOT HIM IN NINETEEN FIFTY-SEVEN
POD1000000018_S0000044	MY NAME IS TYLER MAHAN COY I HEARD THE STORIES MY WHOLE LIFE
POD1000000018_S0000047	IT'S SHOCKING TO HEAR ERNEST TUBB'S NAME ASSOCIATED WITH ANY KIND OF VIOLENCE WHATSOEVER
POD1000000018_S0000051	CRISP TEXAS IS A GHOST TOWN NOW ERNEST TUBB WAS BORN THERE IN NINETEEN FOURTEEN INTO A FAMILY OF SHARECROPPERS LIKE MOST SHARECROPPERS CHILDREN ERNEST GREW UP WORKING ON FARMS ALL OVER THE AREA
POD1000000018_S0000054	LIKE A GREAT NUMBER OF ARTISTS WE'LL LEARN ABOUT IN FUTURE EPISODES IT WAS ALL OVER FOR A FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD ERNEST TUBB THE FIRST TIME HE HEARD JIMMIE RODGERS SING
POD1000000018_S0000058	HEARING JIMMIE RODGERS IS WHAT LED ERNEST TUBB TO DECIDE HE SIMPLY HAD TO BECOME A COUNTRY SINGER
POD1000000018_S0000059	IT'S ALSO VERY SPECIFICALLY WHAT CAUSED HIM THREE DECADES LATER TO WANT TO SHOOT A THREE FIFTY-SEVEN MAGNUM AT JIM DENNY
POD1000000018_S0000062	THE DEATH OF HIS IDOL WAS EXTREMELY UPSETTING FOR ERNEST HOWEVER IT ALSO MADE HIM REALIZE THAT HE WAS GOING TO HAVE TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT CHASING HIS DREAMS
POD1000000018_S0000067	HOLDING DOWN THREE JOBS AT ONCE WAS NECESSARY TO SUPPORT HIMSELF AND HIS YOUNG WIFE ELAINE THEY DIDN'T WASTE ANY TIME BEFORE STARTING TO HAVE KIDS EITHER
POD1000000018_S0000069	ERNEST WAS MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK HARD IF IT KEPT HIM MOVING TOWARD THE LIFE OF HIS HERO JIMMIE RODGERS
POD1000000018_S0000070	HE'D HAD THIS SMALL PICTURE OF JIMMIE FOR YEARS NOW AND IT WAS IN PRETTY BAD SHAPE SO HE GOT A PHONE BOOK AND LOOKED UP THE NUMBER FOR JIMMIE RODGER'S WIDOW CARRIE
POD1000000018_S0000071	HE CALLED HER ON THE PHONE TO EXPLAIN THAT HE WAS SUCH A BIG FAN AND TO SEE IF SHE HAPPENED TO HAVE A BIGGER BETTER PHOTO OF JIMMIE THAT ERNEST COULD HAVE MAYBE EVEN ONE THAT WAS AUTOGRAPHED
POD1000000018_S0000072	CARRIE WAS SUPER NICE AND SHE DID HAVE SUCH A PHOTO THAT ERNEST COULD HAVE AND WENT SO FAR AS TO INVITE HIM OUT TO HER HOUSE IN KERRVILLE TEXAS TO GET THE PICTURE
POD1000000018_S0000073	ERNEST DROVE OUT THERE THE NEXT SUNDAY HE WASN'T WORKING TAKING ELAINE AND THEIR BABY JUSTIN ON THE TRIP
POD1000000018_S0000075	THEY'D PLANNED TO STAY FOR MAYBE TEN MINUTES AND ENDED UP HANGING OUT FOR OVER TWO HOURS LOOKING AT COSTUMES GUITARS AND PICTURES BROUGHT OUT BY MRS RODGERS HEARING HER STORIES ABOUT HOW HIGH ON THE HOG THEY'D LIVED MERELY A FEW YEARS EARLIER
POD1000000018_S0000076	E T COULD NEVER HAVE GUESSED WHEN HE WOKE UP THAT MORNING THAT HE'D BE LAYING DOWN TO SLEEP THAT NIGHT HAVING HELD JIMMIE RODGERS SIGNATURE MARTIN ACOUSTIC GUITAR WITH JIMMIE'S NAME INLAID IN PEARL ACROSS THE FRETBOARD AND THE WORD THANKS WRITTEN ON THE BACK UPSIDE DOWN
POD1000000018_S0000080	OKAY NOW ADD THIS ON TOP OF THAT A FEW MONTHS LATER CARRIE RODGERS CALLED ERNEST TO SAY SHE'D LISTENED FOR HIS RADIO SHOW AS HE'D ASKED FOR HER TO DO
POD1000000018_S0000082	ON THE OTHER HAND SHE DIDN'T THINK HE SOUNDED LIKE JIMMIE RODGERS WHEN HE SANG WHICH IS BASICALLY THE ONLY THING IN THE WORLD ERNEST TUBB WANTED TO DO IN THIS PHASE OF HIS LIFE
POD1000000018_S0000085	ANYWAY SHE STILL HOOKED E T UP WITH ELSIE MCWILLIAMS THE WRITER OF A FEW GREAT JIMMIE RODGERS SONGS
POD1000000018_S0000086	ERNEST TUBB MADE A COUPLE OF RECORDS THAT DIDN'T SELL VERY WELL DID SOME TOURING AND ENDED UP BACK HOME DOING LOW PAYING RADIO AGAIN AND WORKING TWO OR THREE SIDE JOBS LIKE BEFORE DRIVING AROUND A BEER TRUCK WAS ONE OF THEM
POD1000000018_S0000088	AFTER A WHILE BACK AT HOME ERNEST HAD TO HAVE HIS TONSILS TAKEN OUT HE'D LATER SAY THE DOCTORS TOLD HIM NOT TO SING OR YODEL FOR A WHILE AFTER THE SURGERY BUT HE DIDN'T LISTEN
POD1000000018_S0000093	ERNEST HELD A SELF DEPRECATING SENSE OF HUMOR ABOUT HIS OWN VOICE FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE HE LOVED TO SAY THAT NINE OUT OF TEN GUYS SITTING IN BARS AROUND THE COUNTRY COULD SING BETTER THAN HE COULD
POD1000000018_S0000094	I DON'T KNOW IF HE REALLY BELIEVED THAT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN STRANGE TO ME I THINK GEORGE JONES INDISPUTABLY THE GREATEST COUNTRY SINGER IN HISTORY IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ADD ERNEST TUBB'S NEW SINGING STYLE AND ROY ACUFF'S VOICE TOGETHER
POD1000000018_S0000096	YOU JUST HEARD SOME ERNEST HERE'S A LITTLE ROY ACUFF FROM NINETEEN FORTY-TWO
POD1000000018_S0000098	NOW GEORGE JUNDE WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU HANK WILLIAMS WAS HIS FAVORITE SINGER YOU DON'T GET HANK WITHOUT ERNEST AND ROY I'VE SEEN LEFTY FRIZZELL NAMED AS AN INFLUENCE ON GEORGE
POD1000000018_S0000099	LEFTY BORROWED FROM ERNEST AS WELL HOWEVER YOU WANT TO SAY WE GOT TO GEORGE JONES IT ALWAYS COMES BACK TO ROY ACUFF AND ERNEST TUBB
POD1000000018_S0000100	NOW THE PART OF ERNEST YOU CAN HEAR IN GEORGE IS THE TENDENCY TO HOLD ON TO A NOTE FOR LONGER THAN YOU'D EXPECT PICKING THE MELODY UP AND PUTTING IT BACK DOWN IN WAYS THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT WHEN HEARING THEM SING A SONG FOR THE FIRST TIME
POD1000000018_S0000106	IT'S POSSIBLE ERNEST REALLY DIDN'T LIKE HIS NEW VOICE ABOUT A MILLION PEOPLE DISAGREE WITH HIS OPINION HE HAD THAT TONSILLECTOMY IN NINETEEN THIRTY-NINE
POD1000000018_S0000107	IN NINETEEN FORTY HE HAD HIS BIGGEST HIT WALKING THE FLOOR OVER YOU THIS SONG IS STILL SYNONYMOUS WITH THE NAME ERNEST TUBB
POD1000000018_S0000108	IF SOMEONE ONLY KNOWS ONE ERNEST TUBB SONG IT'S USUALLY THIS SONG
POD1000000018_S0000111	THE TEXAS TROUBADOUR ERNEST TUBB
POD1000000018_S0000115	TUBB WOULD STAY WORKING FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE SO MEMBERS OF THE TEXAS TROUBADOURS WOULD BE REPLACED EVERY NOW AND THEN
POD1000000018_S0000116	BUDDY EMMONS JACK GREENE BILLY BYRD LEON RHODES AND CAL SMITH ARE ONLY SOME OF THE NOTABLE PLAYERS WHO JOINED THE BAND ON THEIR WAY UP THE LADDER
POD1000000018_S0000118	THIS WAS THE FIRST WAY ERNEST FOUND TO EXTEND A HELPING HAND TO YOUNGER MUSICIANS LIKE THE HAND CARRIE RODGERS HAD HELD OUT TO HIM
POD1000000018_S0000123	AND SO HE STARTED CALLING THEIR NAMES OUT WHEN THEY GET TOOK A COURSE BUT HE WAS NEVER JEALOUS OF ANYBODY IN HIS BAND OUTSHINING HIM YOU DID YOU KNOW HE DIDN'T MIND THAT AT ALL AS HE PROVED WITH JACK GREENE AND CAL SMITH AND
POD1000000018_S0000124	AH AND BECAUSE HE HAD THE WILBURNS WITH HIM FOR A WHILE AND SKEETER WORKED SOME DATES WITH HIM GEORGE JONES STONEWALL JACKSON AND HE WAS ALWAYS PUSHING THEM AND HE LIKE ROY I THINK UNDERSTOOD THAT THE BIGGER THEY BECAME THE BIGGER HE BECAME
POD1000000018_S0000125	GEORGE JONES AND STONEWALL JACKSON WERE NEVER TEXAS TROUBADOURS JUSTIN MEANT E T TOOK THOSE GUYS OUT ON TOUR WITH HIM AS OPENING ACTS TO HELP THEM BUILD THEIR OWN FOLLOWING AND OFTEN HE DID A LOT MORE THAN THAT
POD1000000018_S0000127	JOHNNY PAID CHECK
POD1000000018_S0000129	AH ERNEST ONE TIME I WAS HANGING AROUND THE STREETS AND IT WAS SNOWING AND BUDDY EMMONS TOOK ME ON TO MEET HIM HE ALWAYS WANTS ME TO MEET HIM
POD1000000018_S0000131	AND EVIDENTLY BUDDY HAD TOLD HIM THAT
POD1000000018_S0000138	YOU CAN'T TELL THE HANK SNOW STORY WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT ERNEST TUBB E T TOLD JOHNNY CASH NOT TO SMILE WHEN HE PERFORMED FOLSOM PRISON BLUES SO PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE COULD REALLY FEEL THE SONG
POD1000000018_S0000139	CASH NEVER FORGOT THE ADVICE HANK WILLIAMS SENIOR WAS HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY ERNEST'S MUSIC AND ERNEST IS THE ONE WHO CONVINCED THE GRAND OLE OPRY TO BRING HANK BACK AFTER HIS FIRST FAILED AUDITION
POD1000000018_S0000140	E T GOT HANK TO PROMISE HE WOULDN'T TOUCH ANY BOOZE FOR THREE MONTHS TO SWING THAT ONE
POD1000000018_S0000141	IN NINETEEN FORTY-SEVEN ENOUGH RADIO LISTENERS WROTE LETTERS COMPLAINING OF NOT BEING ABLE TO FIND HIS MUSIC THAT HE LAUNCHED THE ERNEST TUBB RECORD SHOP IN NASHVILLE IF YOU COULDN'T MAKE IT THERE IN PERSON THEY'D SHIP RECORDS DIRECTLY TO YOU
POD1000000018_S0000144	THE RECORD SHOP OPERATED AT A LOSS OF TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS IT WAS OPEN BUT ERNEST KNEW HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS AND HE KEPT IT ALIVE
POD1000000018_S0000147	ERNEST PLAYED HOST TO OPRY STARS AND NEWCOMERS ALIKE MAKING SURE TO REMIND YOU THIS MUSIC WAS AVAILABLE FOR MAIL ORDER FROM ERNEST TUBB'S RECORD SHOP HE TOOK THE CHANCE TO KEEP JIMMIE RODGERS MEMORY ALIVE PITCHING HIS RECORDS AS WELL
POD1000000018_S0000149	ERNEST NEVER GREW OUT OF HIS FASCINATION WITH JIMMIE RODGERS AND NEVER STOPPED REPAYING HIS DEBT TO JIMMIE'S WIDOW CARRIE JIMMIE'S DEATH HAD LEFT CARRIE IN A PRETTY BAD FINANCIAL SITUATION BUT SHE STILL GOT MONEY FROM THE SALES OF HIS RECORDS WHICH WERE DECLINING
POD1000000018_S0000150	HE REALIZED THE MORE JIMMIE RODGERS RECORDS SOLD THE BETTER OFF CARRIE WOULD BE SO E T PUSHED THOSE RECORDS AS HARD AS HE COULD
POD1000000018_S0000151	CARRIE LOANED AND EVENTUALLY FLAT OUT GAVE HIM THAT GUITAR OF JIMMIE'S WHICH IS WHY YOU'LL FREQUENTLY SEE PICTURES OR VIDEOS OF ERNEST TUBB PLAYING A GUITAR THAT SAYS JIMMIE RODGERS ON IT
POD1000000018_S0000152	IN NINETEEN FIFTY-THREE ERNEST HELPED FOUND THE JIMMIE RODGERS MEMORIAL FESTIVAL IN RODGERS HOMETOWN OF MERIDIAN MISSISSIPPI THAT'S A STAND-UP GUY
POD1000000018_S0000154	YOU CAN FIND PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO'LL SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT JIM DENNY
POD1000000018_S0000155	REMEMBER JIM POOR KID FROM TENNESSEE WORKED HIS WAY UP FROM THE MAILROOM TO BECOME DIRECTOR OF ARTISTS SERVICES AT W S M AND MANAGER OF THE GRAND OLE OPRY
POD1000000018_S0000157	DENNY WAS A POWERFUL MAN IN NASHVILLE AND HE ACTED LIKE HE KNEW IT
POD1000000018_S0000158	WHERE ERNEST TUBB BUILT A REPUTATION FOR HELPING YOUNG MUSICIANS JIM DENNY HAD A REPUTATION FOR ACTING LIKE A DICK
POD1000000018_S0000160	THE JOHNNY CASH E T GAVE ADVICE TO IS THE SAME JOHNNY CASH WHO HAD TO WAIT TWO HOURS OUTSIDE DENNY'S OFFICE
POD1000000018_S0000162	JIM DENNY MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN A DICK HE COULD HAVE SIMPLY BEEN A BUSINESSMAN WHO PAID MORE ATTENTION TO THE BOTTOM LINE THAN HOW MANY FRIENDS HE HAD
POD1000000018_S0000163	DENNY'S THE GUY WHO HAD TO BE CONVINCED TO LET HANK SENIOR ONTO THE OPRY AND HE'S THE GUY WHO CALLED HANK TO FIRE HIM OVER THE TELEPHONE BUT ERNEST TUBB WAS STANDING IN DENNY'S OFFICE WHEN THAT PHONE CALL WAS MADE
POD1000000018_S0000164	HE SAID HE SAW TEARS IN JIM'S EYES
POD1000000018_S0000165	HANK HAD MISSED A SCHEDULED OPRY APPEARANCE MOST LIKELY FOR NO GOOD REASON OTHER THAN THAT HE WAS DRUNK DENNY SAID HE THOUGHT FIRING HANK WOULD MAKE HIM REALIZE HE NEEDED TO GET HIS ACT TOGETHER
POD1000000018_S0000166	THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED HANK WILLIAMS DIED FOUR MONTHS AFTER BEING DISMISSED FROM THE OPRY IT'S TRAGIC BUT YOU CAN SEE HOW JIM DENNY THOUGHT HE WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING IN THAT SITUATION
POD1000000018_S0000167	THIS IS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE BECAUSE THE YEAR HANK WILLIAMS DIED IS THE SAME YEAR THAT JIM DENNY FORMED CEDARWOOD PUBLISHING WITH WEBB PIERCE
POD1000000018_S0000172	ROY ACUFF AND FRED ROSE HAD STARTED ACUFF-ROSE MUSIC BACK IN NINETEEN FORTY-TWO
POD1000000018_S0000174	THEY WERE THE BEST GAME IN TOWN UNTIL JIM DENNY FORMED CEDARWOOD IN FIFTY-THREE
POD1000000018_S0000175	AS HEAD OF ARTISTS SERVICES AT W S M AND MANAGER OF THE GRAND OLE OPRY JIM DENNY CONTROLLED WHO GOT TO PLAY ON THE OPRY THEIR PLACE IN THE LINEUP AND HOW LONG THEY GOT TO PLAY
POD1000000018_S0000178	IF JIM DENNY OWNS A COUNTRY MUSIC PUBLISHING FIRM WHILE RETAINING SINGULAR CONTROL OF THE MOST POPULAR COUNTRY MUSIC RADIO PROGRAM IN AMERICA THEN HE'S ESSENTIALLY PRINTING HIS OWN MONEY
POD1000000018_S0000181	IF THE WRITER DOESN'T WANT TO BE A PERFORMER CONGRATULATIONS WEBB PIERCE IS THE BIGGEST STAR ON THE OPRY AND HE'S PLAYING YOUR SONG ON THE GRAND OLE OPRY TONIGHT
POD1000000018_S0000182	ROY ACUFF WAS PISSED OFF AND HE DIDN'T STAY QUIET ABOUT IT HE SAID DENNY WAS GIVING THE BEST BOUNCE TO HIS OWN ARTIST ARTISTS SIGNED TO ACUFF ROSE HAD A TENDENCY TO SEE ROY'S POINT
POD1000000018_S0000183	ARTISTS SIGNED TO CEDARWOOD HAD A TENDENCY TO THINK JIM DENNY WASN'T DOING ANYTHING WRONG WEIRD HUH
POD1000000018_S0000184	LONG STORY SHORT IN NINETEEN FIFTY-SIX W S M FIRED JIM DENNY OVER HIS CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
POD1000000018_S0000186	HE STARTED A BOOKING AGENCY AND SIGNED MOST OF THE OPRY ARTISTS SOME OF WHOM HAD RESIGNED WHEN DENNY WAS FIRED THEN DENNY CONTACTED THE PHILIP MORRIS TOBACCO COMPANY
POD1000000018_S0000188	SO WHEN JIM DENNY CALLED WITH A CHANCE FOR THEM TO GET THEIR PRODUCT ASSOCIATED WITH ALL THOSE ACTS PHILIP MORRIS WROTE A CHECK BIG ENOUGH TO FUND THE BIGGEST COUNTRY MUSIC PACKAGE TOUR ANYONE HAD EVER SEEN
POD1000000018_S0000191	IT LOOKED AS THOUGH EVERYONE WAS GETTING WHAT THEY WANTED UNTIL THE PHILIP MORRIS COUNTRY MUSIC SHOW BOOKED A STOP IN MERIDIAN MISSISSIPPI ON THE SAME WEEK AS THE FIFTH ANNUAL JIMMIE RODGERS MEMORIAL FESTIVAL
POD1000000018_S0000194	FOR FIVE YEARS ERNEST TUBB HAD WORKED TO GROW THE JIMMIE RODGERS FESTIVAL FROM SCRATCH THIS IS A TREMENDOUSLY DIFFICULT THING TO DO E T PUT IN THE EFFORT TO HONOR HIS IDOL
POD1000000018_S0000196	JIM DENNY WASN'T SIMPLY SETTING UP SHOP ACROSS THE STREET WITH SOME HEALTHY COMPETITION
POD1000000018_S0000197	HE BROUGHT A FREE SHOW TO TOWN ON THE SAME NIGHT WITH HALF THE GRAND OLE OPRY LINEUP AND SEVERAL BIG NAMES YOU WOULD HAVE HAD TO BUY A TICKET TO SEE ON THE JIMMIE RODGERS EVENT THE PREVIOUS NIGHT
POD1000000018_S0000199	IT WOULD CRUSH BONNAROO THIS WAS SUCH A BIG DEAL THAT THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE JIMMIE RODGERS MEMORIAL FESTIVAL THE FOLLOWING YEAR
POD1000000018_S0000200	THEY REGROUPED TO PUT ONE ON AGAIN IN NINETEEN FIFTY-NINE BUT CARRIE RODGERS HEALTH HAD ALREADY TAKEN A TURN FOR THE WORSE AND ERNEST TUBB WAS NEVER INVOLVED WITH THE FESTIVAL AGAIN
POD1000000018_S0000205	ACCORDING TO BILLY BYRD ERNEST TUBB'S REACTION TO THE PHILIP MORRIS COUNTRY MUSIC SHOW UNDERCUTTING THE JIMMIE RODGERS MEMORIAL FESTIVAL WAS TO GET DRUNK AND STAY DRUNK FOR THE BETTER PART OF A WEEK
POD1000000018_S0000206	THEY CARTED HIM BACK TO NASHVILLE BUT HE WAS STILL DRINKING AND HE WAS STILL MAD AS HELL AT JIM DENNY
POD1000000018_S0000207	FINALLY HE CALLED DENNY AT HOME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT TO CUSS HIM OUT DENNY SAID SOMETHING LIKE WELL IF YOU'RE SO MAD ABOUT IT THEN HOW ABOUT YOU JUST MEET ME DOWN AT W S M RIGHT NOW AND WE'LL SETTLE THINGS FOR GOOD
POD1000000018_S0000209	THAT SOUNDED LIKE A GREAT PLAN TO ERNEST TUBB HE STRAPPED ON A GUN BELT WITH BULLETS AND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY-SEVEN MAGNUM IN THE HOLSTER AND DROVE DOWNTOWN IN HIS CADILLAC WEARING HOUSE SLIPPERS
POD1000000018_S0000210	MEANWHILE WHEN JIM DENNY HAD HUNG UP THE PHONE HE SIMPLY TOOK IT BACK OFF THE HOOK AGAIN SO ERNEST COULDN'T CALL HIM ANYMORE AND THEN WENT BACK TO SLEEP
POD1000000018_S0000212	SO ERNEST TUBB IS DRUNK OFF HIS ASS WITH A LOADED GUN WHEN HE STUMBLES INTO THE LOBBY OF THE NATIONAL LIFE BUILDING WHERE W S M WAS LOCATED
POD1000000018_S0000217	BILL WILLIAMS THE NEWS DIRECTOR AT W S M SAYS HE WAS WALKING IN TO WORK WHEN A GUNSHOT RANG OUT IN THE LOBBY AND A BULLET WENT OVER HIS HEAD INTO THE WALL
POD1000000018_S0000218	HE TURNED AROUND YOU KNOW PRETTY SCARED AND SAW ERNEST TUBB STANDING THERE IN HIS HOUSE SLIPPERS WITH A REVOLVER
POD1000000018_S0000220	WHEN HE ASKED ERNEST WHAT THE HELL HE WAS DOING ERNEST SAID MY GOD I'VE SHOT THE WRONG MAN
POD1000000018_S0000221	WHETHER OR NOT HE'D BEEN ACTIVELY TRYING TO KILL ANYONE WE WILL NEVER KNOW FOR CERTAIN IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE HE THOUGHT HE HAD SUCCESSFULLY SHOT SOMEONE AND WAS ONLY UPSET THAT SOMEONE WASN'T JIM DENNY
POD1000000018_S0000222	EITHER WAY ERNEST SETTLED DOWN AFTER THINKING HE'D SHOT AN INNOCENT PERSON BILL WILLIAMS CALLED HIS BOSS JACK DEWITT TO TELL HIM WHAT HAPPENED JACK TOLD BILL TO TAKE ERNEST HOME
POD1000000018_S0000225	ERNEST TUBB WENT TO JAIL FOR DRUNK AND DISORDERLY PLUS CARRYING THE WEAPON
POD1000000018_S0000227	SO ERNEST BOUGHT CIGARETTES FOR ALL THE OTHER INMATES AND SANG SONGS WITH THEM WHILE BILL WILLIAMS WAITED TO TAKE HIM HOME
POD1000000018_S0000231	JIM DENNY'S NAME WAS KEPT OUT OF THE PAPERS THOUGH EVERYONE IN THE BUSINESS COULD READ BETWEEN THE LINES AND SEE WHO ERNEST HAD WANTED TO SHOOT
POD1000000018_S0000233	THE INCIDENT SEEMS TO HAVE HAD NO EFFECT ON ERNEST'S CAREER WHATSOEVER APPARENTLY IF ALL E T WAS TRYING TO DO WAS PUT A BULLET IN JIM DENNY THEN THAT WAS FINE
POD1000000018_S0000236	IN NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR HIS LUNGS KILLED HIM JUST LIKE HIS HERO JIMMIE RODGERS
POD1000000018_S0000238	THE MIDNITE JAMBOREE STILL AIRS EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT AND YOU CAN STILL BUY MUSIC FROM ERNEST TUBB'S RECORD SHOP OR ONLINE AT E T RECORD SHOP DOT COM

POD1000000018_S0000255	IN THE NINETEEN-EIGHTIES CLYDE MOODY TRY TO START AN ALTERNATIVE ASSOCIATION TO THE COUNTRY MUSIC HALL OF FAME CALLED THE COUNTRY MUSIC PIONEER ASSOCIATION
POD1000000018_S0000256	THE C M P A HAD A TRASHY NEWSPAPER THAT CLYDE ESSENTIALLY USED TO RANT AGAINST THE INDUSTRY AND PRINT WHATEVER SHITTY RUMORS PEOPLE SENT IN
POD1000000018_S0000257	AMONG THESE RUMORS WAS ONE THAT ERNEST TUBB DIED BROKE AND ALONE IN A CHEAP DOWNTOWN MOTEL SHUNNED BY THE COUNTRY MUSIC WORLD HE DONE SO MUCH TO HELP

POD1000000018_S0000260	FIRST OF ALL THE SOURCE WAS ERNEST TUBB'S ESTRANGED WIFE NEXT ERNEST DIED OWNING SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE ERNEST TUBB RECORD SHOP WHICH HAD MULTIPLE LOCATIONS RUNNING AND WAS VERY PROFITABLE AT THAT TIME HE WAS NOT A BROKE MAN
POD1000000018_S0000262	I BELIEVE ERNEST CHOSE TO TURN VISITORS AWAY BECAUSE HE WAS WASTING AWAY IS EMPHYSEMA AND DIDN'T WANT ANYONE WHO LOVED HIM TO HAVE THAT AS THEIR LAST MEMORY OF HIM
POD1000000018_S0000265	AND I THINK JUSTIN SAID THAT PEOPLE WOULD GO WILL TRY TO SEE EARNEST AND HE WOULD TELL JUSTIN TO TELL THEM THANK YOU BUT HE'D RATHER NOT HAVE THE COMPANY
POD1000000018_S0000266	SO YOU KNOW I MEAN THE END I I DON'T THINK THAT ERNEST TUBB DIED YOU KNOW AND IT'S SAD STATE OF AFFAIRS I THINK THAT HE DID

POD1000000022_S0000012	AND AT THE TIME OF SARTRE FOR OVER THREE HUNDRED YEARS PEOPLE HAD BEEN POINTING OUT HOW MANY OF THE WAYS WE LOOK AT THINGS IN THE WESTERN WORLD ARE LARGELY DERIVATIVE FROM THE WAY CHRISTIANITY DESCRIBES BEING A HUMAN BEING
POD1000000022_S0000023	THAT A REASONABLE EXPECTATION TO HAVE WHEN NAVIGATING YOUR LIFE IS THAT ONE DAY YOU'RE GONNA WAKE UP AND THERE'S GONNA BE SOME EVENT SOME MIRACLE THAT YOU WITNESS SOME TRANSCENDENT MOMENT WHERE YOU REALIZE THE DIVINITY OF JESUS
POD1000000022_S0000030	MAYBE FOR SOME OF YOU OUT THERE THERE'S ONLY ONE OTHER PERSON IN THIS ENTIRE WORLD THAT HAS FULL ACCESS TO YOUR TRUE SELF HIDDEN DEEP WITHIN YOU BUT SARTRE WOULD SAY IS THIS REALLY HOW THE SELF WORKS
POD1000000022_S0000031	IS THE SELF REALLY LIKE THE CHRISTIAN SOUL HIDDEN SOMEWHERE DEEP WITHIN YOU THAT ONLY YOU HAVE ACCESS TO SARTRE WOULD SAY IT VERY WELL MAY BE THAT YOU PUT ON A MASK WHEN YOU GO OUT IN PUBLIC FOR THE SAKE OF PRAGMATISM AND IT VERY WELL MAY BE THAT YOU'VE REFLECTED ON YOURSELF
POD1000000022_S0000033	THIS CONCEPT IS A COMMON ONE IN EXISTENTIALISM IT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF THE MAIN THEMES IN DOSTOYEVSKY'S BOOK CRIME AND PUNISHMENT THE IDEA THAT YOU KNOW WE OFTEN THINK WE KNOW A LOT MORE ABOUT OURSELVES THAN WE ACTUALLY DO IN PRACTICE TWO EXAMPLES OF THIS
POD1000000022_S0000036	THAT GUY NOW THIS MAN BELIEVES BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT THAT HE IS NAPOLEON IF YOU SET HIM DOWN AND THEN ASKED HIM CANDIDLY NO BUT WHO ARE YOU REALLY DEEP DOWN INSIDE HE WOULD SAY I'M NAPOLEON BONAPARTE COMMANDER OF THE ARMIES OF THE NORTH
POD1000000022_S0000037	HUSBAND TO A MURDERED WIFE FATHER TO A MURDERED SON AND I WILL HAVE MY VENGEANCE BUT IS THIS MAN REALLY NAPOLEON WE KNOW HE'S NOT NAPOLEON IN FACT IN A WEIRD WAY AS OUTSIDERS WE SEEM TO HAVE AN ADVANTAGE WHEN IT COMES TO KNOWING WHO HE REALLY IS
POD1000000022_S0000040	I'M GOING TO THE SPORTING GOODS SECTION I MAY I'M GONNA GO UP INTO THE RAFTERS LIKE I'M TOM CRUISE AND SNAP THE DUDE'S NECK I'M GONNA DO THIS BECAUSE THAT'S JUST THE KIND OF PERSON I AM THAT'S ME I'D SACRIFICE MY LIFE FOR THE GREATER GOOD NOW HE MAY TELL HIS FRIENDS THIS
POD1000000022_S0000044	SARTRE SAYS THAT WHEN YOU TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THE SELF IT'S NOT A SOUL IT'S NOT A PERSONALITY HIDDEN DEEP WITHIN YOU WHAT WE'RE REFERENCING WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE SELF TURNS OUT TO BE MUCH MORE COMPLEX THAN THAT WITH ME MORE MOVING PARTS
POD1000000022_S0000045	AND I THINK A GOOD PLACE TO BEGIN IF WE WANNA UNDERSTAND SARTRE'S VIEWS ON WHAT THE SELF REALLY IS IS TO TALK ABOUT TWO FOUNDATIONAL ASPECTS OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A HUMAN BEING THAT TO SARTRE SEEM TO BE CONSTANTLY INTERTWINED AND DEPENDENT UPON EACH OTHER WHAT HE CALLS OUR FACTICITY
POD1000000022_S0000048	FULLY AFFIRMATIVE AND BEING FOR ITSELF AS BEING CONSCIOUSNESS OR THE SOURCE OF ALL NEGATION WELL ONE DAY WHEN SARTRE'S TRYING TO MEET HIS MONTHLY QUOTA FOR OBSCURE SOUNDING PHILOSOPHICAL DESCRIPTIONS THE WAY HE DESCRIBES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO ONTOLOGICAL CATEGORIES IS THAT BEING IN ITSELF
POD1000000022_S0000049	QUOTE IS WHAT IT IS AND BEING FOR ITSELF QUOTE IS WHAT IT IS NOT WELL AS WEIRD AS THAT SOUNDS IN A VACUUM AFTER LISTENING TO LAST EPISODE WE ALL KNOW WHAT HE MEANS WHEN HE SAYS IT BUT THEN SARTRE POINTS OUT SOMETHING VERY MYSTERIOUS A VERY STRANGE COINCIDENCE
POD1000000022_S0000050	WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO ONTOLOGICAL CATEGORIES TWO THINGS THAT ARE EASY TO WRITE OFF AS JUST THESE MEANINGLESS ABSTRACT CONCEPTS THAT SARTRE COOKED UP ONE DAY WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW BEING IN ITSELF AND BEING FOR ITSELF RELATE TO EACH OTHER
POD1000000022_S0000051	SARTRE NOTICES THERE SEEMS TO BE A SIMILAR SORT OF RELATIONSHIP AT THE FOUNDATION OF WHO WE ARE AS PEOPLE SEE BECAUSE ON ONE HAND ALL OF US HAVE OUR FACTICITY AND FACTICITY IS KIND OF LIKE BEING IN ITSELF IT'S THE FULLY AFFIRMATIVE SET OF FACTS THAT ARE TRUE ABOUT US
POD1000000022_S0000053	I I I'M SCARED OF SPIDERS THINGS LIKE THAT RIGHT IN OTHER WORDS STATEMENTS OF FACTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY TRUE ABOUT US THAT'S WHAT MAKES UP OUR FACTICITY BUT WHAT SARTRE WOULD WANT US TO CONSIDER IS THAT WHILE THESE KINDS OF STATEMENTS ARE NO DOUBT USEFUL WHEN IT COMES TO DESCRIBING CERTAIN PIECES OF WHO I AM
POD1000000022_S0000058	YOU CAN START TO HEAR THE WEIRD SARTRE DESCRIPTION CREEPING IN THERE JUST LIKE BEING IN ITSELF IS WHAT IT IS AND BEING FOR ITSELF IS WHAT IT IS NOT IN A SENSE I AM WHAT I AM I HAVE A FACTICITY BUT I ALSO AM WHAT I AM NOT YET
POD1000000022_S0000066	WHEN SARTRE TALKS ABOUT RADICAL FREEDOM WHEN ANY OF US TALK ABOUT BEING INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE FREE TO ACT AS THEY CHOOSE WE'RE NEVER TALKING ABOUT TOTAL FREEDOM RIGHT IT'S ALWAYS FREEDOM WITHIN CERTAIN LIMITATIONS
POD1000000022_S0000072	BUT YEAH ULTIMATELY THE POINT SARTRE'S MAKING HERE WITH THE CONCEPTS OF FACTICITY AND TRANSCENDENCEIS IT'S NOT ONLY TO STOP THINKING ABOUT YOUR SELF AS THOUGH IT'S THIS ARTIFACT HIDDEN DEEP WITHIN YOU INSIDE OF A VAULT BUT ALSO STOP THINKING ABOUT WHO YOU ARE AS THOUGH IT'S THIS STATIC
POD1000000022_S0000075	UNLESS IF YOU'RE DEAD YOU'VE NEVER ARRIVED AT A DESTINATION AS A HUMAN BEING NOW AT FIRST GLANCE THIS MAY SEEM LIKE SARTRE'S WRITING A SELF HELP BOOK NO NO SINGLE FACT ABOUT YOU SUMS UP WHO YOU ARE RELEASE YOUR INNER TRANSCENDENCE NO
POD1000000022_S0000076	NO LIKE WE TOUCHED ON LAST TIME SARTRE THINKS THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE TRULY FACED WITH THE NUMBER OF THESE POSSIBILITIES ARE FREE TO CHOOSE FROM MOST OF THE TIME THEY DON'T GET EXCITED THEY'RE HORRIFIED BY IT IN FACT MOST OF THE TIME ONCE PEOPLE REALIZE THIS STUFF
POD1000000022_S0000077	SARTRE THINKS THAT THE SECRET COVERT DESIRE OF EVERYONE WHETHER THEY REALIZE IT OR NOT IS TO ESCAPE THIS DUALITY IT'S TO TURN THEMSELVES INTO EITHER PURE FACTICITY OR PURE TRANSCENDENCE OR AS SARTRE SAYS WE ALL SECRETLY WANT TO BECOME GOD
POD1000000022_S0000080	GOD IS PERFECT AS HE IS PURE FACTICITY BUT ON THE OTHER HAND GOD IS ALL POWERFUL AND CAPABLE OF BRINGING ABOUT ANY POSSIBILITY HE WANTS IN OTHER WORDS PURE TRANSCENDENCE SARTRE WOULD SAY THIS IS NO COINCIDENCE
POD1000000022_S0000083	OR PURE TRANSCENDENCE LIKE GOD IS WHAT SARTRE CALLS BAD FAITH LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE MOST FAMOUS EXAMPLE OF BAD FAITH THAT SARTRE LAYS OUT BECAUSE WE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT IT IN THE OTHER EPISODE I'LL KEEP IT BRIEF
POD1000000022_S0000084	SARTRE TALKS ABOUT SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF A CAFE IN PARIS WATCHING A WAITER AS HE DOES HIS JOB THEN YOU CAN IMAGINE A WAITER IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES RIGHT DRESSED UP IN HIS LITTLE OUTFIT VERY UPRIGHT GOOD POSTURE VERY PROPER
POD1000000022_S0000085	HE HOLDS THE TRAY IN A PARTICULAR WAY HE WALKS AND CHANGES DIRECTION IN A VERY MILITARISTIC PARTICULAR WAY LIKE A GOOD WAITER DOES SARTRE CAN'T HELP BUT POINT OUT THAT THIS GUY DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A SELF WITH FACTICITY AND TRANSCENDENCE IN THIS MOMENT
POD1000000022_S0000087	GO TO MOST RESTAURANTS AND YOU CAN FIND SOME MODERN VERSION OF WHAT SARTRE'S TALKING ABOUT HERE I MEAN THERE'S SO MANY SERVERS OUT THERE THAT HAVE FALLEN INTO BAD FAITH AND ARE JUST SORT OF PLAYING THE ROLE OF THE SAME PERSON IT SEEMS TO BE A MODERN ARCHETYPE OF WHAT IT IS TO BE A SERVER THEY ALL SAY THE SAME STUFF
POD1000000022_S0000088	HI I'M JOHN I'M GONNA BE TAKING CARE YOU TODAY CAN I GET YOU GUYS STARTED WITH A BOTTOMLESS BUCKET OF SHRIMP OR SOME DRINKS OR SOMETHING BUT IT'S AT EVERY STAGE OF THE MEAL HOW'S EVERYTHING TASTING FOR YOU GUYS YOU ALL SAVE ROOM FOR DESERT THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO RUSH I'M GONNA LEAVE THE CHECK HERE I'M GONNA GO OVER THERE
POD1000000022_S0000090	ASK YOURSELF IS THIS THE WAY THIS GUY TALKS TO HIS MOM IS THIS THE WAY HE TALKS TO HIS BEST FRIENDS NO HE'S FALLEN INTO BAD FAITH AND IS JUST PLAYING THE PART OF A SERVER NOW THE POINT SARTRE'S MAKING IS NOT THAT WAITERS NEED TO BE MORE CREATIVE IT'S NOT ABOUT WAITERS
POD1000000022_S0000091	SARTRE THINKS THAT AS HUMAN BEINGS WE HAVE A TENDENCY TO GRAVITATE TOWARDS THIS TRAP IN ALL ASPECTS OF OUR LIFE WE MAKE PROCLAMATIONS ABOUT WHAT WE ARE ALL THE TIME I AM A STAY AT HOME MOM THAT'S MY IDENTITY
POD1000000022_S0000094	AND WE USE BAD FAITH TO QUELL THIS FEELING OF NAUSEA WE'RE CONSTANTLY DOING THIS WITH OURSELVES NOW IF ALL YOU EVER READ WAS SARTRE'S BEING AND NOTHINGNESS YOU MIGHT GET THE READ FROM THE BOOK THAT THIS TENDENCY WE HAVE TO GRAVITATE TOWARDS BAD FAITH
POD1000000022_S0000096	BUT IN ONE OF THE FOOTNOTES OF BEING AND NOTHINGNESS SARTRE ALLUDES TO A WAY OUT OF ALL OF IT AND PERHAPS TO AN ETHICS THAT HE'D WRITE LATER ON IN THIS LIFE WELL HE NEVER WRITES AN ETHICS UM AND IT MAY BE BECAUSE YOU KNOW HIS LIFELONG PARTNER
POD1000000022_S0000097	AND FELLOW EXISTENTIALIST SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR PRODUCES WHAT MANY CONSIDER TO BE THE GREATEST EXISTENTIALIST APPROACH TO ETHICS CALLED THE ETHICS OF AMBIGUITY NEXT EPISODE IS PART TWO ONCE SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR SO WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ALL ABOUT IT UM BUT ENOUGH OF BAD FAITH LET'S GET BACK TO ANSWERING THIS QUESTION WHO AM I
POD1000000022_S0000100	SARTRE WOULD SAY YOU DON'T HAVE SOME PRIVILEGED V I P ACCESS TO THE FACTS THAT ARE TRUE ABOUT YOU AND THE POSSIBILITIES THAT YOU HAVE I MEAN HYPOTHETICALLY ANY OTHER PERSON IF THEY WERE DILIGENT ENOUGH HAS ACCESS TO YOUR FACTICITY AND TRANSCENDENCE
POD1000000022_S0000101	IN FACT JUST LIKE THE GUY THAT TELLS HIMSELF THAT HE'S NAPOLEON SOMETIMES OTHER PEOPLE ARE BETTER AT TELLING US WHO WE ARE THAN WE ARE BUT HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE THE REASON IT'S POSSIBLE IS BECAUSE THE SELF IS NOT THE CHRISTIAN SOUL TO SARTRE
POD1000000022_S0000104	NO WE TELL OURSELVES STORIES ALL THE TIME WHAT FOLLOWS FROM THIS IS THAT THE TRUE MEASURE OF YOUR VALUES THE TRUE MEASURE OF WHO YOU ARE IS WHAT YOU ACTUALLY DO IT'S THE COLLECTION OF WHAT YOU'VE ACTUALLY DONE THUS FAR IN YOUR LIFE AND SARTRE SAYS THAT WHEN YOU STOP LOOKING AT THE SELF
POD1000000022_S0000107	AND NOTHINGNESS THAT SARTRE LAYS OUT HIS THIRD ONTOLOGICAL CATEGORY WHAT HE CALLS BEING-FOR-OTHERS LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT HE MEANS SARTRE WOULD SAY THAT AN INTRINSIC PART OF WHAT IT IS TO BE YOU IS EXISTING ALONGSIDE OTHER PEOPLE AND ALL OF THE CONSEQUENCES THAT COME ALONG WITH THAT
POD1000000022_S0000108	THIS IS SARTRE'S CONCEPT OF BEING-FOR-OTHERS NOW HOW DOES BEING-FOR-OTHERS AFFECT MY ANSWER TO THE QUESTION WHO AM I WELL AGAIN THIS CONCEPT OF THE SELF IS OUTSIDE OF US IT'S AN ABSTRACTION
POD1000000022_S0000109	AND WHAT SARTRE POINTS OUT IS THAT THERE ARE MANY ASPECTS ABOUT WHO WE ARE THAT ARE GIVEN TO US BY OTHER PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE WHETHER WE'RE TRUSTWORTHY OR NOT WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE A TRUSTWORTHY PERSON IS AN ASPECT OF WHO YOU ARE THAT'S MEDIATED BY OTHER PEOPLE RIGHT
POD1000000022_S0000111	AND HOW OTHER PEOPLE VIEW US SEEM TO BE CONNECTED TO SARTRE BUT THE FLIP SIDE OF IT BEING THAT INTERCONNECTED IS THAT IT LEAVES US AN WHAT HE SUBSCRIBES IS A A PERPETUAL STATE OF BEING JUDGED BY THE PEOPLE AROUND US
POD1000000022_S0000114	YOU WILL HENCEFORTH BE KNOWN AS THE WEIRD SHOES GUY IN THAT PERSON'S MIND THIS IS CONSTANTLY GOING ON BUT SARTRE'S NOT SAYING IT'S ALWAYS BAD THAT BEING AROUND OTHER PEOPLE IS SOME PARANOID EVERYBODY'S THINKING BAD THINGS ABOUT ME ALL THE TIME THING
POD1000000022_S0000115	PEOPLE VERY WELL MAY BE THINKING REALLY GOOD THINGS ABOUT YOU ALL THE TIME THE POINT THAT SARTRE WANTS TO MAKE IS THAT THIS WHOLE DYNAMIC THIS DYNAMIC OF OTHER PEOPLE SEEING YOU PUTTING YOU ON TRIAL AND TURNING YOU INTO PURE FACTICITY IN THEIR MINDS THIS IS GOING ON ALL THE TIME
POD1000000022_S0000121	IT MAY SEEM TO US LIKE WE HAVE A SORT OF SPECIAL ACCESS TO KNOWING WHO WE ARE AND THAT WE CHOOSE TO SHARE OURSELVES WITH ONLY OUR CLOSEST FRIENDS WE TRUST EARLY BUT SARTRE WOULD SAY THAT THE REASON IT SEEMS THAT WAY IS CAUSE WHAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE IS A NARRATIVE ABOUT YOURSELF
POD1000000022_S0000124	IS BECAUSE THAT'S THE VERY CRITERIA WE ALL USE TO CHOOSE WHO OUR FRIENDS ARE GONNA BE IS WHETHER OR NOT THEY REINFORCE THIS PICTURE THAT WE HAVE FOR OURSELVES THAT'S WHAT WE LIKE ABOUT OUR FRIENDS TO SARTRE
POD1000000022_S0000125	FOR EXAMPLE IF A BIG PART OF THE WAY THAT YOU VIEW YOURSELF IN YOUR IDENTITY IS THAT YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF TO BE A SMART PERSON SARTRE WOULD PREDICT THAT MOST OF YOUR FRIENDS ARE GONNA BE PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT SO SMART THAT TELL YOU THAT YOU'RE SMART ALL THE TIME
POD1000000022_S0000126	OR PEOPLE THAT ASK YOU A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT YOU THEN ANSWER MAKING YOU FEEL SMART OR OTHER SMART PEOPLE THAT COMMEND YOU ON BEING SMART LIKE THEM TO SARTRE WE CHOOSE OUR FRIENDS BECAUSE THEY REINFORCE THE WAY THAT WE VIEW OURSELVES
POD1000000022_S0000128	AND OF COURSE IT'S GONNA FEEL VALIDATING OF COURSE IT WOULD SEEM THAT YOU KNOW BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE WHO YOU ARE BUT AGAIN SARTRE WOULD SAY THAT THE TRUE MEASURE OF YOUR VALUES THE TRUE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION WHO ARE YOU
POD1000000025_S0000006	I'M DAVEED DIGGS
POD1000000025_S0000007	I'M RAFAEL CASAL
POD1000000025_S0000010	IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO SUMMARIZE THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN DAVEED AND RAPHAEL BECAUSE AS BEST FRIENDS AND CREATIVE COLLABORATORS THEY'VE DONE SO MUCH OVER THE YEARS TOGETHER

POD1000000025_S0000129	AND WE DID FIVE YEARS IN L A BEFORE DIGGS WENT TO NEW YORK TO DO HAMILTON
POD1000000025_S0000130	I THINK THAT WAS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT CAME ABOUT FOR DIGGS REALLY ORGANICALLY
POD1000000025_S0000131	HAMILTON WAS SUCH AN INTERESTING LIKE MUST LIKE IT WAS A PLAY IT WAS LIKE LEGIT WRITTEN FOR HIM TO FLEX ALL THE THINGS HE'S GOOD AT
POD1000000025_S0000134	AND THE WORLD SAW DIGGS IN THE LIGHT THAT BEST SHOWED EVERYTHING AND THEY NOT ONLY ACCEPTED BUT OBSESSED OVER IT
POD1000000025_S0000136	AND THE FIRST THING THAT HAPPENED IS THIS GIRL GRABS MY ARM AND LOOKS AT DIGGS AND GOES OH MY GOD IS THAT DAVEED DIGGS TO ME

POD1000000027_S0000017	AND EVEN THOUGH SHELLY WAS ALMOST EIGHTY YEARS OLD SHE WAS STILL GOING INTO TOWN AS RICH PEOPLE CALL BEVERLY HILLS FOUR OR FIVE DAYS A WEEK IT'S HARD TO GUESS SHELLY'S AGE IF YOU DON'T KNOW IT
POD1000000027_S0000019	THERE ARE THE ICONIC BROWN AND YELLOW SIGNS THAT LET YOU KNOW YOU HAVE ENTERED A SPECIAL PLACE AND SHELLY STERLING AND HER HUSBAND DONALD OWNED A TON OF IT
POD1000000027_S0000022	BUT MOST PEOPLE KNEW HER HUSBAND DONALD STERLING AS THE LONG TIME OWNER OF THE LOS ANGELES CLIPPERS ONE OF THE WORST OWNERS IN ALL OF SPORTS HIS TEAM WAS THE LAUGHINGSTOCK OF THE N B A FOR DECADES

POD1000000027_S0000085	THE FIGHT WITH SHELLY STARTED WHEN HE HUNG UP
POD1000000027_S0000086	NOT THAT THAT WAS UNCOMMON EVEN WITHOUT V THEY FOUGHT OFTEN BUT THIS WAS ESCALATING SHELLY AND DONALD'S YOUNGEST SON SCOTT HAD TO STEP IN BEFORE IT GOT PHYSICAL HE CONFRONTED HIS FATHER AND DEMANDED HE STOP THIS NONSENSE WITH V
POD1000000027_S0000091	A WEEK LATER SCOTT DIED
POD1000000027_S0000100	SHELLY WAS DEVASTATED
POD1000000027_S0000103	IT WASN'T JUST THAT THE FIGHT WITH V WAS A LAST VOLATILE MOMENT BETWEEN DONALD AND SCOTT
POD1000000027_S0000105	WHEN SCOTT DIED DONALD STAYED WITH V INSTEAD OF GOING HOME TO HIS WIFE AS SHE GRIEVED IT WAS TOO MUCH SHE KICKED DON OUT OF THE HOUSE
POD1000000027_S0000107	SHELLY NEEDED BREATHING ROOM AND I THINK DON HAD PUSHED THE ENVELOPE A LITTLE TOO FAR
POD1000000027_S0000110	BUT SHELLY AND DONALD HAD BEEN TOGETHER TOO LONG BEEN THROUGH TOO MUCH TOGETHER HAD TOO MUCH OF THEIR LIVES AND THEIR MONEY INTERTWINED
POD1000000027_S0000112	THEY DID NOT DIVORCE THE SITUATION SIMPLY CONTINUED TO DETERIORATE OVER THE NEXT YEAR AS DONALD SPENT MORE AND MORE TIME WITH V
POD1000000027_S0000114	PLUS SHELLY WAS STARTING TO LEARN ABOUT THE GIFTS V POSTED PICTURES ON INSTAGRAM V DRIVING THE TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS RED FERRARI THAT DONALD HAD BOUGHT HER
POD1000000027_S0000115	AND THE RANGE ROVER AND THE TWO BENTLEYS SHELLY ALSO FOUND OUT THAT DONALD HAD BOUGHT V A ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR DUPLEX
POD1000000027_S0000117	IT WAS THAT ANGER SHELLY BROUGHT TO NEIMAN MARCUS WITH HER RETURNS ON THE FATEFUL DAY SHE THAT SHE ENCOUNTERED DONALD AND V IT WASN'T THE FIRST TIME THE TWO WOMEN HAD RUN INTO EACH OTHER OR ARGUED BUT THIS TIME SHELLY DECIDED SHE'D HAD ENOUGH
POD1000000027_S0000119	ON MARCH SEVEN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN SHELLY STERLING FILED A LAWSUIT IN CALIFORNIA SUPERIOR COURT AGAINST V STIVIANO SEEKING THE RETURN OF ALL THOSE GIFTS FROM DONALD
POD1000000027_S0000121	DONALD AND SHELLY STERLING WERE WORTH MULTIPLE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND HAD DONE WHAT THE ULTRA RICH DO PUT ALL THEIR MONEY AND PROPERTY INTO A JOINT TRUST
POD1000000027_S0000122	EVERY DIME THE STERLINGS SPENT COST EACH OF A THEM A NICKEL THEREFORE SHELLY ARGUED THE MONEY THAT DONALD USED TO PAY FOR THE GIFTS WAS JUST AS MUCH HERS AS IT WAS HIS
POD1000000027_S0000123	SO SHE TURNED TO THE COURTS THAT SOUNDS A LITTLE EXTREME WELL YOU DON'T KNOW THE STERLINGS CALLING A LAWYER IS HOW THEY GET OUT OF BED IN THE MORNING
POD1000000027_S0000126	SHE KEPT SAYING TO DONALD YOU BETTER HAVE HER DROP THE LAWSUIT AND HE'D SAY OH SHE WON'T REALLY GO THROUGH WITH IT BUT SHE'S JUST DOING IT FOR EFFECT AND SHE SAYS WELL SHE BETTER DROP THE LAWSUIT
POD1000000027_S0000127	BUT HERE'S HOW THE LAWSUIT THE COURTROOM PRODUCT OF A BEDROOM DISPUTE REALLY CAME TO CHANGE EVERYTHING FOR SOME TIME NOW V HAD BEEN RECORDING HER CONVERSATIONS WITH DONALD
POD1000000027_S0000128	SWEETIE I'M SORRY
POD1000000027_S0000130	AND ACCORDING TO V AND HER LAWYER DONALD WAS AWARE SHE WAS MAKING THE TAPES
POD1000000027_S0000135	SHE'D RECORDED HUNDREDS OF CONVERSATIONS OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS A LOT OF THE RECORDINGS WERE MUNDANE BORING EVEN BUT SOME OF THE RECORDINGS WERE ARGUMENTS AND CAPTURED A SIDE OF DONALD THAT HE WOULD NEVER WANT HIS WIFE OR ANYONE ELSE TO HEAR
POD1000000027_S0000137	NO MATTER WHAT THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THOSE TAPES WAS THEY BECAME SOMETHING V COULD USE AS BLACKMAIL BECAUSE V STIVIANO HAD NO INTENTION OF RETURNING THOSE GIFTS FROM DONALD
POD1000000027_S0000139	V SAYS TO DONALD I WANT THAT BITCH WIFE OF YOURS LAWSUIT DISMISSED
POD1000000027_S0000140	PIERCE O'DONNELL IS SHELLY STERLING'S LAWYER
POD1000000027_S0000141	AND HE TRIED TO GET SHELLY TO DISMISS IT AND SHE WOULDN'T DO IT
POD1000000027_S0000142	IF DONALD COULDN'T OR WOULDN'T FIX THE SITUATION V DECIDED SHE WOULD TAKE MATTERS INTO HER OWN HANDS IT WAS TIME TO USE THE TAPES
POD1000000027_S0000143	TO REVEAL DONALD STERLING FOR WHO HE REALLY WAS
POD1000000027_S0000161	ON APRIL NINE TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN A CLIPPERS EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT TEXTED V ON BEHALF OF DONALD
POD1000000027_S0000166	MISTER STERLING SAID TO LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED ANYTHING WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANY ISSUES AT THE GAME
POD1000000027_S0000178	IT WAS SHOCKING THE CLIPPERS ASSISTANT IMMEDIATELY EMAILED THE FILE TO CLIPPERS PRESIDENT ANDY ROESER AND THAT'S HOW SHELLY LEARNED ABOUT THE TAPE TOO
POD1000000027_S0000180	AND I SAID WELL WHAT IS THE TAPE ABOUT SO I SAID TO ANDY ANDY ROESER I SAID ANDY WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT THIS AND HE SAYS OH WELL SHE'LL NEVER DO ANYTHING
POD1000000027_S0000181	ROESER HAD WORKED FOR DONALD STERLING FOR NEARLY THREE DECADES HE DID WHAT EVERYBODY LEARNS TO DO AFTER A WHILE STAY OUT OF THE REALLY UGLY STUFF
POD1000000027_S0000182	DONALD AND SHELLY HAD CLEANED UP THEIR OWN MESSES FOR SIX DECADES HE FIGURED THEY'D EVENTUALLY MAKE THIS ONE GO AWAY TOO BUT THEY DIDN'T SHELLY TOLD HER LAWYERS ABOUT THE TAPES
POD1000000027_S0000183	AND THEY IN TURN WENT TO V'S LAWYER AND DEMANDED TO HEAR THEM AND THAT'S WHEN V STIVIANO MADE HER BIG MOVE
POD1000000027_S0000186	MIKE WALTERS WAS THE NEWS DIRECTOR AT T M Z AT THE TIME NOW HE RUNS HIS OWN CELEBRITY NEWS SITE THE BLAST
POD1000000027_S0000187	THE FIRST THING I DID WAS SAY WHO'S DONALD STERLING I HAD HEARD THE NAME I KNEW THAT DONALD STERLING WAS IMPORTANT BUT I HAD NO IDEA THAT HE OWNED THE CLIPPERS
POD1000000027_S0000201	THE FACT IS SHELLY AND SEVERAL PEOPLE IN THE CLIPPERS ORGANIZATION HEARD THE RECORDING AND DECIDED NOT TO ACT ON IT OR WEREN'T APPALLED ENOUGH TO ACT ON IT MAYBE THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW BIG A SPLASH THIS TAPE COULD MAKE
POD1000000027_S0000209	SO MIKE WALTERS CALLED UP THE N B A THEIR NEW COMMISSIONER ADAM SILVER HAD BARELY BEEN IN OFFICE FOR THREE MONTHS
POD1000000027_S0000210	I ACTUALLY HAD NEVER HEARD OF ADAM SILVER UNTIL THAT DAY
POD1000000027_S0000217	AFTER CALLING THE LEAGUE T M Z CALLED THE CLIPPERS TO LET THEM KNOW THEY WERE ABOUT TO PUBLISH A TAPE THAT WOULD BE VERY DAMAGING TO DONALD STERLING
POD1000000027_S0000218	IF YOU'RE DONALD STERLING THERE'S NEVER A GOOD TIME TO HAVE YOUR GIRLFRIEND OUT YOU AS A RACIST IF YOU'RE THE CLIPPERS THIS COULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED AT A WORSE MOMENT DONALD STERLING'S CLIPPERS HAD BEEN A LAUGHING STOCK FOR DECADES
POD1000000027_S0000220	BECAUSE HONESTLY LIKE THESE CLIPPERS JOKES IS SOMETHING WE THEY'RE NOT EVEN JOKES THEY'RE STATEMENTS OF FACT
POD1000000027_S0000222	IN THE THIRTY SOME ODD YEARS HE HAD OWNED THE TEAM THEY'D ONLY MADE THE PLAYOFFS SIX TIMES THEY'D NEVER EVEN MOVED PAST THE SEMIFINALS THAT HAD ALL STARTED TO CHANGE IN THE LATE TWO THOUSANDS THOUGHT THE TEAM HAD DRAFTED A STAR BLAKE GRIFFIN
POD1000000027_S0000223	N B A ROOKIE OF THE YEAR BLAKE GRIFFIN
POD1000000027_S0000225	AND THEN ENDED UP WITH ANOTHER STAR CHRIS PAUL
POD1000000027_S0000226	LOS ANGELES IS ELECTRIC WITH THE ADDITION OF CHRIS PAUL TO THE CLIPPERS
POD1000000027_S0000231	IN TIME FOR THIS SEASON THE CLIPPERS HAD ALSO MANAGED TO GET THEMSELVES ONE OF THE BEST COACHES IN THE N B A DOC RIVERS
POD1000000027_S0000232	IT'S DOC RIVERS TO THE CLIPPERS THREE YEARS TWENTY-ONE MILLION DOLLARS
POD1000000027_S0000240	ONCE THE CLIPPERS STAFF FOUND OUT T M Z WAS GOING TO PUBLISH THE TAPE ANDY ROESER WENT TO COACH DOC RIVERS HE NEEDED HIM TO TALK TO THE TEAM BEFORE THE STORY BROKE
POD1000000027_S0000241	ANDY I REMEMBER COMING INTO MY OFFICE ONE DAY AND SAID HEY THERE'S A TAPE THAT T M Z HAS THIS IS GONNA COME OUT IT'S NOT THAT FLATTERING BUT IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL HONESTLY I THOUGHT IT WAS A SEX TAPE BECAUSE UM DONALD STERLING I REALLY DID
POD1000000027_S0000242	SO DOC DID AS HE WAS TOLD HE GATHERED THE PLAYERS AND WARNED THEM THAT SOMETHING WAS COMING SUPERSTAR CLIPPERS FORWARD BLAKE GRIFFIN AND CENTER RYAN HOLLINS WERE IN THAT ROOM
POD1000000027_S0000243	DOC GATHERED US
POD1000000027_S0000244	DOC SAID HEY GUYS WE NEED TO MEET AND TALK
POD1000000027_S0000253	THIS IS AN AUDIO RECORDING PURPORTEDLY OF LOS ANGELES CLIPPERS OWNER DONALD STERLING MAKING RACIST REMARKS TO HIS GIRLFRIEND IS BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION
POD1000000027_S0000268	LIKE T M Z'S MIKE WALTERS AS SOON AS I HEARD THAT TAPE I KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO BE HUGE
POD1000000027_S0000270	STERLING HAS A LONG HISTORY OF QUESTIONABLE BEHAVIOR
POD1000000027_S0000273	WITHIN HOURS THE AUDIO OF DONALD STERLING MAKING RACIST REMARKS TO V STIVIANO HAD GONE VIRAL
POD1000000027_S0000278	BY MORNING LEBRON JAMES THE BIGGEST STAR IN THE LEAGUE WAS SAYING THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR A PERSON LIKE DONALD STERLING IN THE N B A
POD1000000027_S0000280	AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY ADAM SILVER WAS FACING HIS FIRST REAL CRISIS
POD1000000027_S0000281	N B A COMMISSIONER ADAM SILVER SITTING DOWN IN MEMPHIS ADDRESSING THE COMMENTS MADE BY DONALD STERLING
POD1000000027_S0000284	I'M NOT YET PREPARED TO DISCUSS ANY POTENTIAL SANCTIONS AGAINST DONALD STERLING WE WILL HOWEVER MOVE EXTRAORDINARILY QUICKLY IN OUR INVESTIGATION
POD1000000027_S0000286	IF IT WAS STERLING ON THOSE TAPES IF THEY HADN'T BEEN DOCTORED OR ALTERED SILVER KNEW HE WANTED TO PUNISH HIM SEVERELY THE LEAGUE WAS OUTRAGED
POD1000000027_S0000287	BECAUSE ON TOP OF DONALD STERLING SAYING ALL THESE UNFORGIVABLY RACIST THINGS STERLING WAS ALSO TAKING SHOTS AT ONE OF THE MOST BELOVED FIGURES IN ALL OF BASKETBALL MAGIC JOHNSON
POD1000000027_S0000289	IT WAS AS SHOCKING AND AS BIZARRE ANYTHING ON THE TAPE THAT A PICTURE OF V STIVIANO AND MAGIC JOHNSON HAD SET HIM OFF TO HEAR DONALD STERLING TALK THAT WAY ABOUT MAGIC
POD1000000027_S0000290	THE GUY WHO'D TURNED THE LAKERS INTO A DYNASTY WHO'D FOUGHT OFF H I V THAT'S THE GUY DONALD STERLING TOLD HIS MISTRESS WASN'T WELCOME AT HIS GAMES
POD1000000027_S0000294	EVEN THE FAMOUSLY APOLITICAL MICHAEL JORDAN VOICED HIS OUTRAGE
POD1000000027_S0000295	MICHAEL JORDAN WEIGHED IN THERE IS NO ROOM IN THE N B A OR ANYWHERE ELSE FOR THE KIND OF RACISM AND HATRED THAT MR STERLING ALLEGEDLY EXPRESSED WE CANNOT TOLERATE MUST NOT TOLERATE DISCRIMINATION AT ANY LEVEL
POD1000000027_S0000298	IT'S LIKE WHAT ONE OF THE PAPARAZZI WHO WAS TAILING DONALD AND SHELLY TOLD ME IT HAD ALL THE ELEMENTS SEX MONEY SPORTS POLITICS GREED RACISM
POD1000000027_S0000299	IT HAD EVERYTHING IT EVEN HAD THE VISOR YOU REMEMBER THE VISOR THAT DAFT PUNK WELDING MASK MEETS FLORIDA GRANDMA VISOR THAT V STIVIANO WORE ANY TIME SHE STEPPED OUTSIDE HER HOUSE
POD1000000027_S0000300	BUT STILL SAY NOTHING IS V STIVIANO NOT LATE THIS AFTERNOON WHEN SHE ARRIVED HOME OR WHEN SHE LEFT TONIGHT WEARING DIFFERENT CLOTHES BUT COLOR COORDINATED FACE SHIELDS
POD1000000027_S0000302	HAVE YOU TALKED TO MR STERLING CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE MASK
POD1000000027_S0000306	BY THE END OF THE WEEKEND THE FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS ANSWERING QUESTIONS ABOUT STERLING
POD1000000027_S0000309	THE TAPES DOMINATED THE NEWS CYCLE NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY WERE JUICY BUT BECAUSE DONALD STERLING WAS ARTICULATING SOMETHING DEEPER MORE SHAMEFUL
POD1000000027_S0000314	INCLUDING RYAN HOLLINS
POD1000000027_S0000318	LOS ANGELES SITS ON TWO FAULT LINES THE SAN ANDREAS AND RACE ALL OF US KNOW IT WE LIVE WITH IT DONALD STERLING WAS ANOTHER
POD1000000027_S0000319	ANYONE WHO PLAYED FOR HIM OR WORKED FOR HIM OR COVERED HIM IN THE PRESS OR LIVED IN ONE OF HIS HUNDREDS OF APARTMENTS ON THE ONE HAND KNEW THAT IT WAS ALL A MATTER OF TIME UNTIL HE BLEW UP THE UNDERLYING ISSUES WITH STERLING WERE WELL KNOWN AND WELL DOCUMENTED
POD1000000027_S0000320	BUT LIKE MOST INSANELY WEALTHY WHITE MEN IN AMERICA DONALD HAD MANAGED TO WIGGLE BULLY AND FIGHT HIS WAY OUT OF ALL HE KNEW HOW TO PLAY HIS LEVERAGE AND POWER OUTLAST HIS ADVERSARIES AND WIN YOU CAN CALL IT THAT
POD1000000029_S0000002	FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA THIS IS MARKETPLACE TECH DEMYSTIFYING THE DIGITAL ECONOMY AND JACK STEWARD INFORMALLY WOOD
POD1000000029_S0000006	NEARLY EVERY CRISIS FACEBOOK NOW FACES STEMS FROM THAT NICHOLAS THOMPSON EDITOR-IN-CHIEF OF WIRED SAYS THAT'S LEFT MANAGEMENT'S NAVIGATE METAPHORICAL MIND FIELD
POD1000000029_S0000010	SECONDLY ONE OF THE SMARTEST BUSINESS DECISIONS THAT MARK ZUCKERBERG EVER MADE WAS TO BUY INSTAGRAM AND PEOPLE DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT INSTAGRAM IS OWNED BY FACEBOOK OR IF THEY DISTRUST FACEBOOK THEY DON'T DISTRUST INSTAGRAM SO INSTAGRAM CONTINUES TO GROW
POD1000000029_S0000023	ABSOLUTELY WHAT ARE THE STAKES TO THEIR BUSINESS THEY ARE A VERY HIGH IF SCANDAL CONTINUES TO MULTIPLY THERE COULD BE REAL CONSEQUENCES DOWN THE ROAD WHAT ARE THE STAKES SPECIFICALLY TO TOP MANAGEMENT MEANING MARK ZUCKERBERG AND SHERYL SANDBERG TWO PEOPLE WHO WE MOST ASSOCIATE WITH THE COMPANY
POD1000000029_S0000024	FOR ZUCKERBERG HE'S GOING TO RUN THE COMPANY AS LONG AS HE WANTS TO HE HAS VOTING CONTROL OF THE SHARES HE'S APPOINTED HIS FRIENDS AS BOARD MEMBERS HE IS IN A GOOD POSITION
POD1000000029_S0000025	WHENEVER HE WANTS TO GO AND RUN THE CHAN ZUCKERBERG INITIATIVE OR JUST GO BE AN INTELLECTUAL THOUGHT LEADER OR DO BILL GATES TYPE THINGS HE WILL GO CHOOSE TO DO THAT FOR SANDBERG IT'S TOUGHER
POD1000000029_S0000026	AND THERE WERE MOMENTS IN THE LAST YEAR WHERE IT SEEMED LIKE SHE MIGHT BE SACRIFICED OR WHERE SHE MIGHT BE IN BIG TROUBLE ZUCKERBERG HAS EXPRESSED HIS LOYALTY TO HER
POD1000000029_S0000036	THERE WAS ONE SPECIFIC STORY THAT STUNNED ME AND THAT WAS THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LED TO THE DEPARTURE OF THE TWO FOUNDERS OF INSTAGRAM KEVIN SYSTROM AND MIKE KRIEGER
POD1000000029_S0000037	AND WHEN FRED VOGELSTEIN AND I STARTED REPORTING THE STORY AND WE MADE A LIST OF THE MYSTERIES WE WANTED TO SOLVE AND THAT WAS AT THE VERY TOP WHY HAD THEY LEFT IT SEEMED STRANGE THEY HAD LEFT ALL OF A SUDDEN IN SEPTEMBER
POD1000000029_S0000038	NO ONE KNEW WHY AND LATE IN THE REPORTING YOU KNOW MONTHS INTO REPORTING THE STORY WE FINALLY LEARNED THE FULL STORY AND THAT IS THAT ACCORDING TO PEOPLE CLOSE TO THEM THEY HAD GROWN FRUSTRATED WITH ZUCKERBERG'S INCREASED MEDDLING
POD1000000029_S0000040	AND THERE WAS A SENSE AMONG SOME PEOPLE AT FACEBOOK THAT INSTAGRAM'S GROWTH WAS COMING AT THE EXPENSE OF CORE FACEBOOK AND THAT LED TO ALL KINDS OF TENSIONS AND THEN A BIG FIGHT AT THE END OF JULY AND A MOMENT WHERE MARK ZUCKERBERG
POD1000000029_S0000042	AND THEN HE GAVE THE LIST TO KEVIN SYSTROM AND SAID WE'RE GETTING RID OF ALL OF THESE AND ACCORDING TO PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH THE STORY SYSTROM REACTED QUITE BADLY TO THAT AND THEN WENT ON PATERNITY LEAVE CAME BACK AND SAID I'M DONE HERE
POD1000000029_S0000043	AND SO THE BIGGEST SURPRISE TO US WAS THAT THE DEPARTURE OF SYSTROM AND KRIEGER WHICH HADN'T COME OUT BEFORE WAS MUCH TENSER MUCH TENSER THAN I HAD BELIEVED WHEN I BEGAN REPORTING THE STORY
POD1000000029_S0000044	NICK THOMPSON EDITOR-IN-CHIEF OF WIRED FOR CONTEXT A FIVE BILLION DOLLAR FINE WOULD BE A RECORD TECH PENALTY IN THE U S BITTING THE TWENTY-TWO MILLION THE GOOGLE HAVE TO PAY IN TWENTY TWELVE

YOU1000000023_S0000002	FIRE EMBLEM IS TURNING THIRTY NEXT YEAR AND WITH SIXTEEN MAIN GAMES AND A FEW SPINOFFS IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT IT HAS GROWN INTO SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY THE GAMES ARE PACKED WITH DEEP STORY LINES AND MEMORABLE CHARACTERS LIKE MARTH
YOU1000000023_S0000003	THAT'S NOT MARTH MARTH THAT'S WHICH ONE IS MARTH
YOU1000000023_S0000005	MARTH

YOU1000000023_S0000027	CAIN AND ABEL ARE BATTLE BROS THEY FIGHT TOGETHER BUT NOT IN THE BIBLICAL SENSE BORD AND CORDS ARE SIMILAR EXCEPT THEY'RE USUALLY AXE FIGHTERS PEGASUS SISTERS ARE A TRIO OF FLYING HORSES LADIES
YOU1000000023_S0000028	YOU CAN'T SPLIT THESE ARCHETYPES UP INTO THEIR SOLO CHARACTERS BECAUSE THEIR BOND IS WHAT DEFINES THEM YOU CAN'T HAVE A WALUIGI WITHOUT A LUIGI AND IN THE SAME WAY YOU CAN'T HAVE A BORD WITHOUT A CORD WHICH IS MY FAVORITE DOCTOR SEUSS BOOK
YOU1000000023_S0000029	JAGENS ARE MENTORS THAT ARE STRONG IN THE BEGINNING AND THEN YOU'LL QUICKLY OUTPACE THEM AND IT'S KIND OF SAD LIKE THE FIRST TIME YOU BEAT YOUR DAD IN A BASKETBALL GAME OIFEYS ARE SIMILAR TO JAGENS EXCEPT THEY'LL KEEP DUNKING ON YOU TILL YOU'RE DEAD
YOU1000000023_S0000030	WENDELLS ARE MENTORS BUT FOR MAGIC GOTOHS ARE MENTORS BUT ONLY THE LAST HALF OF THE GAME BEOWOLFS ARE MERCENARIES THAT YOU HAVE TO PAY ACTUAL IN GAME CURRENCY TO RECRUIT AND OGMAS ARE MERCENARIES THAT USUALLY DECIDE TO JOIN YOU OUT OF THEIR OWN VOLITION
YOU1000000023_S0000034	YOU CAN'T GET THE OTHER KIND OF LIKE IF TWO OF YOUR FRIENDS START DATING AND THEN HAVE A REALLY MESSY BREAKUP CORNELIUSES ARE USUALLY THE PARENTAL FIGURE TO THE MAIN CHARACTER AND THEY HAVE THIS NASTY HABIT OF GETTING AXED SUPER EARLY ON IN THE GAME
YOU1000000023_S0000035	IT'S KIND OF LIKE FIRE EMBLEM DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE INTERESTING CHARACTERS WITHOUT MAKING THEM SUFFER TRAUMATIC PARENTAL DEATH
YOU1000000023_S0000049	BUT BEFORE I GET THERE I JUST WANT TO COMMEND FIRE EMBLEM FOR HAVE FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY-SIX PLAYABLE CHARACTERS AND ONLY REPEATING THREE NAMES WHEN I WAS HIRED FOR MY FIRST JOB AT A CLIMBING GYM I WAS ONE OF FIVE EMPLOYEES NAMED BRIAN
YOU1000000023_S0000054	THAT TOOK LIKE THIRTY MINUTES BUT LET'S BEGIN THE HONORABLE KNIGHT LIKE FIONA WHO CARES PASSIONATELY ABOUT HER PEOPLE AND WILL ALWAYS OPPOSE CRUELTY TO CIVILIANS
YOU1000000023_S0000055	WHICH IS WAY BETTER THAN THE LOYAL KNIGHT LIKE TROUDE WHO ONLY IS LOYAL TO PERNE AND WILL DO LITERALLY ANYTHING FOR HIM EVEN THOUGH PERNE IS A BAD DUDE BUT I'LL GET TO THAT LATER
YOU1000000023_S0000059	BUT THAT'S NOT MY FAULT SUPER SMASH SHOULD'VE INCLUDED MORE MAGIC BABIES ARROGANTS HOTHEADS AND EDGELORDS ALL HAVE A MEAN SIDE BUT ARROGANTS LIKE VAIKE JUST THINK THEY'RE THE BEST HOTHEADS LIKE CASPAR WANT TO FIGHT ANYTHING THAT MOVES
YOU1000000023_S0000060	AND EDGELORDS LIKE NILES RETWEET JOKER ACCOUNTS UNIRONICALLY A LOT OF THESE CHARACTERS HAVE ROUGH CHILDHOODS BUT THEN TURN OUT CHEERFUL DESPITE THAT AND THEN THERE'S THE INFERIORITY COMPLEX ARCHETYPE WHICH I COULD HAVE JUST CALLED THE MAJORITY OF CHILDREN IN FIRE EMBLEM FATES
YOU1000000023_S0000061	PERFECTIONISTS MISCHIEF MAKERS AND FLIRTS ARE ALL HIGHLY MOTIVATED BUT SUBAKI IS MOTIVATED TO MEET HIGH EXPECTATIONS CLAUDE IS MOTIVATED TO MAKE INTRICATE SCHEMES AND SYLVAIN IS MOTIVATED TO BE A FUCCBOI
YOU1000000023_S0000062	BUZZKILLS ARE JUST CHARACTERS THAT AREN'T VERY FUN TO TALK TO AND FIRE EMBLEM I WILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU FOR NAMING AN UNEMOTIONAL UBER RELIGIOUS DEADBEAT DAD GILBERT IT ALSO DOESN'T HELP THAT I LOOK LIKE HANNEMAN LITE
YOU1000000023_S0000064	OH GOD AM I A BUZZKILL A LOT OF THESE ARCHETYPES ARE BASED AROUND ONE SINGULAR PERSONALITY TRAIT SCARLET'S STRAIGHTFORWARD VALBAR'S CHILL LINHARDT'S LAZY SUMIA'S CLUMSY PETRA'S A SWEETIE AND RANULF IS A FURRY
YOU1000000023_S0000066	CHILD SOLDIER KARIN IS CANONICALLY FOURTEEN YEARS OLD
YOU1000000023_S0000069	MANUELA IS CONSTANTLY DRINKING AND FLIRTING AND JUST BEING A HOT MESS AND I LOVE HER FOR IT AND THAT MAKES HER THE PRESIDENT OF VICES
YOU1000000023_S0000070	THE VICE PRESIDENT BUT BE CAREFUL NOT TO DO THAT AROUND SOMEONE LIKE ASTRAM WHO IS CONSTANTLY ACCUSING PEOPLE OF TREASON FOR NO GOOD REASON
YOU1000000023_S0000072	HERE'S AN ARCHETYPE I CALL WHAT THE FUCK AND IT'S THE THREE CHARACTERS THAT MAKE ME SAY WHAT THE FUCK FIRE EMBLEM PEOPLE LIKE PERNE WHO IS SAID TO BE A SWEET ROBIN HOOD TYPE EXCEPT HE DOES KIDNAP A YOUNG GIRL AND KEEPS HER AS HIS SLAVE
YOU1000000023_S0000073	OR THARJA WHO PRACTICES CURSES ON HER OWN DAUGHTER OR ROGER WHO IS ACTUALLY HE'S NOT ACTUALLY THAT BAD
YOU1000000023_S0000074	BUT FIRE EMBLEM DOES GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO MAKE HIS END SCREEN SAY THAT HE NEVER GETS A DATE AND HE STAYS SINGLE FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE AND IT'S LIKE WHAT THE FUCK FIRE EMBLEM YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO HIM DIRTY LIKE THAT
YOU1000000023_S0000075	THE NEXT ARCHETYPE IS CALLED ACTUALLY PRETTY INTERESTING THESE CHARACTERS ARE THREE DIMENSIONAL AND WELL-DEVELOPED PEOPLE LIKE LIBRA WHO STRUGGLES WITH HIS FAITH AND HAS INCREDIBLE SELF DOUBT EVEN THOUGH HE'S DOING ALL HE CAN TO HELP THOSE AROUND HIM
YOU1000000023_S0000076	OR RHYS WHO DREAMS OF BEING A SWORD FIGHTER BUT HIS WEAK CONSTITUTION WON'T ALLOW HIM TO BECOME ONE AND SO HE HELPS IN THE WAYS HE CAN BUT HIS WHOLE STORY IS ONE OF UNFULFILLED DREAMS
YOU1000000023_S0000078	AND THAT'S IT THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO INTERESTING CHARACTERS IN FIRE EMBLEM UNTIL WE GET TO RAPHAEL MY SWEET BULKY BOY WHO ONLY CARES ABOUT EATING AND TRAINING AND NOT ABOUT STUDYING
