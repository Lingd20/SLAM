YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00001	Okay, so let me introduce our first speaker who is Seen van der Kloen.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00003	Team Fandarklu is the special projects advisor at Wild Animal Initiative and also offers coaching and consulting to new effective animal advocacy groups.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00005	So right now I pass the microphone to you, Sting.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00007	Thank you, Bianca. And thank you for carefully pronouncing my name. I appreciate it.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00008	And Monica, too, also thanks for hosting this. I'm sure you're very tired on this last day, but from my perspective, at least, everything has gone very well these last two days.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00010	Yeah, so I will switch now to sharing my screen. Hopefully I can make that work.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00012	Bye.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00014	LET'S SEE. IF YOU CANNOT SEE THIS, CAN YOU SIGNAL? OKAY. GREAT.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00016	I THINK YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A MANAGER TO LEAD.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00018	AND I WILL TRY TO EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY TODAY.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00020	Hello everyone, nice to see a whole bunch of familiar faces here. I appreciate that you're using your Sunday afternoon for some people Sunday very early morning to be here to learn how you can better protect animals.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00022	I just finished a sci-fi novel about anarchy. I am a product of colonialism. I don't depend on my work for money, and I have such issues with authority that I won't even follow recipe instructions.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00024	That is not my usual introduction to who Stien van der Ploeg is, but I think it's helpful for you to know where I'm coming from. So you feel encouraged to listen to me with an open mind to why I think you can and should lead, even if you're not a manager.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00026	I HOPE YOU WILL BE SKEPTICAL NOT JUST OF ME BUT OF ALL LEADERSHIP STRATEGIES YOU LEARN ABOUT. THERE ARE MILLIONS OF BOOKS AND CLASSES AND PODCASTS ABOUT LEADERSHIP.

YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00029	TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT MY PROFESSIONAL SITUATION. I HAVE WORKED AT VARIOUS NONPROFITS OVER 15 YEARS IN FUNDRAISING, ADMINISTRATION, OPERATIONS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00030	AND I JUST STARTED TO WORK FOR WILD ANIMAL INITIATIVE.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00032	AT WILD ANIMAL INITIATIVE, MY SUPER SMART AND COMPASSIONATE COLLEAGUES AT THIS RESEARCH INSTITUTE WORK TO UNDERSTAND AND IMPROVE THE LIVES OF FREE RANGING SENTIENT ANIMALS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00033	I OFFER PROJECT BASED SUPPORT TO NEW EFFECTIVE ANIMAL ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS. I AM LUCKY ENOUGH TO DO ALL MY WORK FOR FREE WITHOUT TAKING SALARIES.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00035	So the ideas I will share with you today have largely been stolen from these books and a bunch of others and from articles and podcasts, but also from various courses and classes.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00036	SOME DIRECTLY ABOUT PEOPLE MANAGEMENT, OTHERS ABOUT CRITICAL THINKING, EFFECTIVE ALTRUISM, DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION OR NEGOTIATION, BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00038	ANGELA VELASQUEZ- I have learned from doing, and I have learned from these people. These are some of my colleagues at the various charities I've worked for.

YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00041	I'VE LEARNED FROM MAKING MISTAKES, FROM PEOPLE'S FEEDBACK AND THROUGH OSMOSIS, BEING AROUND PEOPLE WHO LEAD AND EXPERIENCING WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOESN'T. AND FROM TALKING AND LISTENING TO THESE PEOPLE.

YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00047	WELL, I WILL NOT BLOW YOUR MIND WITH NOVEL IDEAS. I WILL SHARE WHAT I THINK ARE SOME COMMON SENSE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU CAN TRY TO TURN INTO COMMON PRACTICE.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00048	LEARN VAN QUESTION WHATYOUIL
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00049	I WILL EXPLAIN WHY I THINK YOU SHOULD QUESTION IDEAS, PLANS, ASSUMPTIONS AND THE BEHAVIOUR OF YOUR CO-WORKERS, INCLUDING YOUR MANAGERS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00051	INSPIRE YOUR COLLEAGUES AND SHOW THEM THE DIFFERENCE THEY MAKE.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00053	SUPPORT YOUR COWORKERS DEVELOPMENT AND CONNECT WITH YOUR TEAM SO PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY BELONG. THESE FOUR PILLARS WILL STRENGTHEN YOUR LEADERSHIP. I HATE THE WORD STRENGTHEN. I CANNOT PRONOUNCE IT.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00055	AFTERWARDS, I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU WHAT YOU THINK AND HEAR ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCES. AND ALL THE WAY AT THE END, WE SHOULD HAVE TIME TO GO OVER YOUR QUESTIONS IN SLIDO.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00057	So why do I think you should lead?
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00059	THIS WHOLE PRESENTATION REST ON FOUR ASSUMPTIONS I HAVE ABOUT YOU. I THINK YOU WANT TO HELP MORE ANIMALS. YOU KNOW SOME INTERVENTIONS AND WORK METHODS ARE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN OTHERS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00061	LEAD PERSONAL
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00063	YOU WANT YOUR COWORKERS TO FEEL THE SAME. SO BASED ON THESE ASSUMPTIONS, I BELIEVE IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO TRY TO LEAD YOUR TEAM AND ORGANIZATION IN THE DIRECTION THAT HELPS THE MOST ANIMALS. AND THOSE ANIMALS INCLUDE YOUR COWORKERS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00065	IT IS NOT JUST YOUR MORAL DUTY, I THINK, TO STAND UP FOR WHAT IS RIGHT. WE MUST TRY TO DO THE MOST GOOD WE CAN.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00067	WHEN YOU LEAD, YOU WILL PREVENT BURNOUT.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00069	FONALYTICS FOUND PEOPLE LEAVE ANIMAL ORGANIZATIONS DUE TO LEADERSHIP AND BURNOUT.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00070	YOUR LEADERSHIP CAN IMPROVE TEAM SPIRIT, CREATE A TRUSTING, OPEN AND SAFE ENVIRONMENT, CONTRIBUTE TO A NON-BLAME CULTURE, AND SHOW THE DIFFERENCE YOUR COLLECTIVE WORK IS MAKING.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00072	THIS WILL MAKE IT LESS LIKELY THAT YOU OR THE PEOPLE ON YOUR TEAM WILL SUFFER FROM MENTAL AND PHYSICAL STRESS AND EXHAUSTION.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00074	YOU WILL HELP MORE ANIMALS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00076	AS YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD JAMIE SAY YESTERDAY, ANIMAL ADVOCACY CAREERS FOUND CEOs AND HIRING PROFESSIONALS IN EFFECTIVE ANIMAL ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS IDENTIFIED LEADERSHIP AS ONE OF THE MOST URGENT SKILL GAPS IN OUR MOVEMENT.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00077	SO YOUR LEADERSHIP WILL MAKE THE MOVEMENT MORE EFFECTIVE. YOU CAN HELP FILL THOSE GAPS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00079	GROWTH.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00081	RELATIONSHIPS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00083	LEADING WHEN YOU'RE NOT IN MANAGEMENT IS NOT ALWAYS EASY. SOME PEOPLE MIGHT NOT APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DO. HIERARCHICAL ORGANIZATIONS AND MANAGERS STUCK TO THEIR WAYS MIGHT LABEL YOU DIFFICULT.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00085	BUT YOU WILL HAVE TO STAND UP FOR WHAT IS RIGHT. YOU MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR HOW YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES ARE TREATED.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00087	AND YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. YOU CAN SAVE MORE ANIMALS AND YOU CAN PROBABLY EXPERIENCE MORE JOY IN YOUR WORK THAN YOU THINK YOU CAN.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00089	SO TO GET TO THE FIRST POINT,
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00091	QUESTION IDEAS PLANS ASSUMPTIONS AND BEHAVIOR
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00093	NOSY PLOEG VAN STIEN QUESTION INQUSTION DER WHATS IS NOSY PLOEG VAN STIEN QUESTION INQUSTION DER WHATS IS NORMAL NOSY PLOEG VAN STIEN QUESTION INQUSTION DER WHATS IS NORMAL IN NOSY PLOEG VAN STIEN QUESTION INQUSTION DER WHATS IS NORMAL IN EACH NOSY PLOEG VAN STIEN QUESTION INQUSTION DER WHATS IS NORMAL IN EACH OF NOSY PLOEG VAN STIEN QUESTION INQUSTION DER WHATS IS NORMAL IN EACH OF OUR NOSY PLOEG VAN STIEN QUESTION INQUSTION DER WHATS IS NORMAL IN EACH OF OUR COUNTRIES NOSY PLOEG VAN STIEN QUESTION INQUSTION DER WHATS IS NORMAL IN EACH OF OUR COUNTRIES TO NOSY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00094	IT DIDN'T MATTER THAT MOST PEOPLE FOLLOWED THE CUSTOMS OF ANIMAL ABUSE. YOU FELT IT WAS WRONG, DID RESEARCH AND ARE WORKING TO CHANGE THE STATUS QUO.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00096	YOU CAN USE THAT SAME CURIOSITY, HUMILITY AND MORAL COMPASS OF YOURS TO MAKE YOUR ORGANIZATION MORE EFFECTIVE.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00098	NOSY VAN STIEN PLOEG QUESTION
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00100	THE MANAGERS AND EXECUTIVES IN YOUR ORGANIZATION MIGHT ALSO NOT HAVE THE FULL PICTURE OR FULLY GRASP WHAT THE DAY-TO-DAY WORK ON THE GROUND IS LIKE. YOUR PERSPECTIVE IS HELPFUL IN FINDING THE BEST OPTION.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00102	BECAUSE OF YOUR POSITION, YOU MIGHT ALSO BE BETTER AT TAKING THE LEAD ON CERTAIN ISSUES. AS SOMEONE WITHOUT HIERARCHICAL AUTHORITY, YOU ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE BLINDED BY THE POWER YOU HAVE. MULTIPLE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00103	POWER AND PRIVILEGE INFLUENCE ONE'S ABILITY TO MAKE EVIDENCE-BASED DECISIONS WITH AN OPEN MIND?
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00105	IS KNOWING WHAT YOU KNOW AND KNOWING WHAT YOU DON'T.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00107	IT CAN BE HARDER FOR THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE TO KNOW WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW. YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND, MIGHT BE BETTER ABLE TO THINK CRITICALLY HOW AN OPERATION SYSTEM OR A CORPORATE CAMPAIGN COULD WORK.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00109	THE PURPOSE OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING?
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00111	KNOWING WHY SOMETHING IS IMPORTANT FOR THE MISSION TO SUCCEED AND HOW IT WORKS WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU TO DO IT. YOU ASKING QUESTIONS WILL ALSO MAKE IT EASIER FOR OTHERS TO SPEAK UP. WHY DOES THIS MEETING LEAD TO SAVE MORE ANIMALS?
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00112	WHY DOES THIS CAGE FREE STRATEGY LEAD TO LESS SUFFERING? WHY ARE THESE PEOPLE ON YOUR GOVERNING BOARD?
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00114	WHEN YOU DIG INTO THESE WHY'S YOU CLARIFY THE WORK FOR OTHERS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00116	THEN BE NOSY AND NOISY OR BE CURIOUS AND DIFFICULT
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00118	IF YOU ARE THE SMART AND SILENT TYPE WHO FIXES MISTAKES WITHOUT CONFRONTING THE ERROR MAKERS, YOU ACTUALLY ARE UNDERMINING ORGANIZATIONAL LEARNING.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00119	IF YOU THINK SOMETHING COULD POSSIBLY BE DONE BETTER BUT YOU DON'T SPEAK UP, YOU MIGHT SAY FEWER ANIMALS. SO PLEASE, BE NOSY AND NOISY.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00121	And don't forget to question your own ideas and actions either. Is what you're doing really the best way to get results? How do you know? Maybe ask the opinion of someone who's willing to disagree with you.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00123	THAN INSPIRE
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00125	SHOW PEOPLE WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT WE CAN MAKE TOGETHER.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00127	FUNALITICS FOUND THAT DISSATISFACTION WITH A TYPE OF ADVOCACY AND NOT FEELING LIKE YOU MAKE A DIFFERENCE ARE BIG REASONS THAT PEOPLE LEAVE ANIMAL ADVOCACY MOVEMENT.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00129	YOU CAN RECONNECT PEOPLE TO THEIR MOTIVATION. YOU CAN HELP THEM SEE THE IMPACT THEY HAVE BY INSPIRING PEOPLE YOU LIGHT THEM INTO ACTION. TOGETHER WE CAN DO IT.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00131	BILLIONS OF FARMED ANIMALS WILL CONTINUE TO BE MURDERED EVERY YEAR
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00133	WE STILL KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE EXPERIENCES OF ANIMALS IN THE WILD, LET ALONE ABOUT HOW TO SUSTAINABLY REDUCE THEIR SUFFERING. THOSE FACTS ARE BLEAK.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00135	I'M ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT THAT WE ARE BUILDING THE ROADS TOWARDS THE FUTURE IN WHICH HUMANITY CARES FOR ANIMALS. THE ACTIONS WE TAKE TODAY CAN SPARE A VAST NUMBER OF ANIMALS A LIFETIME OF SUFFERING JUST YEARS FROM NOW.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00137	SO MANY FISHES, CHICKENS, PIGS, I CANNOT EVEN IMAGINE. THEY'LL HAVE BETTER LIVES.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00139	IT IS DIFFICULT AND MUCH STANDS IN OUR WAY, BUT TOGETHER WE CAN BUILD NOT JUST ROADS BUT ROCKETS TO A BETTER FUTURE.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00141	I HOPE YOU REMEMBER THIS AND REMIND EACH OTHER WHEN THINGS GET HARD THAT OUR WORK MAKES A DIFFERENCE FOR REAL INDIVIDUALS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00143	MAKE THE INVISIBLE CLEAR SPREADSHEETS MAKE ANIMALS HAPPIER
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00145	SOMETIMES WE NEED TO DO THINGS THAT SEEM FAR REMOVED FROM PROTECTING ANIMALS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00147	FILLING OUT SPREADSHEETS RAISING MONEY CREATING BUDGETS ADMINISTRATION WE'RE NOT ALL RESCUING FOXES FROM FUR FARMS REMIND YOURSELF AND OTHERS HOW MUNDANE TASKS RELATE TO A BETTER WORLD
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00148	WHEN I COMPARE LAST YEAR'S AVERAGE DONATIONS TO THIS YEAR'S, THAT MEANS I WILL HAVE MORE INFORMATION TO RAISE MORE MONEY NEXT TIME.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00149	AND WITH MORE MONEY AT WILD ANIMAL INITIATIVE WE CAN HIRE MORE RESEARCHERS AND LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW WE CAN GIVE ANIMALS THE LIVES THEY PREFER.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00151	BE IMPATIENT FOR A BETTER FUTURE WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND WE MUST MAKE A DIFFERENCE OUR WORK IS NOT JUST IMPORTANT IT IS URGENT
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00152	THE MORE TIME AND ENERGY WE WASTE, THE MORE ANIMALS WILL SUFFER. THE SMARTER WE WORK, THE QUICKER WE WILL FIND WAYS TO HELP ANIMALS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00154	REMIND EACH OTHER OF THIS AND MODEL THAT URGENCY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00156	CELEBRATE WINDS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00158	MUST BE CELEBRATED. NO, COUNTLESS HEN ROAMING IN A BARN WITHOUT SUNLIGHT, LAYING EGGS WITHOUT EVER RAISING CHILDREN IS NOT GOOD.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00159	BUT A SWITCH TO THAT FROM TINY CAGES MEANS LESS PAIN, IT MEANS MORE EXPENSIVE EGGS, IT MEANS WE ARE A STEP CLOSER TO LIBERATION. IT'S LIKE WE PASSED A TEST ON THE WAY TO GRADUATION. IT DESERVES A REWARD.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00161	AND WHEN YOU CELEBRATE INDIVIDUAL ACHIEVEMENTS, MAKE IT SPECIFIC. DON'T JUST SAY A PARTNER WORKED DAY AND NIGHT TO CREATE A BEAUTIFUL VEGAN VIDEO.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00163	EXPLAIN WHY THAT IS AN IMPORTANT STEP ON THE WAY TO ANIMAL LIBERATION. IF INSTEAD YOU SAY THIS VIDEO SHE WORKED ON SO HARD WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR A MESSAGE TO SPREAD.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00164	FOR PEOPLE TO BE INSPIRED TO EAT BETTER FOOD THANKS TO APARNA'S WORK FEWER ANIMALS WILL BE KILLED FOR FOOD
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00166	IMPATIENT MAKING MAKE DIFFERENCE BETTER SMALL
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00168	MAKE SURE YOU FEEL GOOD WHEN YOU DO GOOD. HELP OTHERS FEEL SUCCESSFUL. HELPING OTHERS FEEL SUCCESSFUL WILL LEAD THEM TO CONTINUE TO WANT TO DO THEIR CRITICAL WORK.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00170	VISUALIZE THE PEACEFUL WORLD WE WANT TO LIVE IN AND HOW WE ARE GETTING THERE TOGETHER.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00172	DEVELOP DEVELOP AND GROW OTHER LEADERS. I'M NOT SURE ABOUT YOU, THOUGH I THINK YOU DO TOO. I WANT TO GROW. I WANT TO BECOME A BETTER PERSON THAN I AM TODAY.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00174	I WANT TO GET BETTER AT PROTECTING ANIMALS. I CANNOT DO THAT ALONE. I NEED TO LEARN FROM THE PEOPLE AROUND ME WHO HAVE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON THE IMPACT I MAKE AND WHO HAVE DIFFERENT KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCES.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00176	A leader actively takes on the role of supporting people to become their best selves.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00177	NOT ONLY DOES THAT MEAN YOU GIVE SOMEONE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE BETTER, IT MEANS THE ORGANIZATION WILL BE BETTER AT ACHIEVING ITS GOALS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00179	AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A MANAGER TO DO THIS. WE EACH HAVE SOME INSIGHTS OR ABILITIES THAT OTHERS ON OUR TEAMS DO NOT. IF YOU SHARE THOSE, YOU DEVELOP OTHERS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00181	GIVE FEEDBACK.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00183	FEEDBACK BEING EXPLICIT ABOUT HOW MY ACTION LED TO HELPING MORE ANIMALS IS AN INCREDIBLE MOTIVATOR.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00185	GIVING CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK GENUINELY AIMED AT HELPING ME BE BETTER THAT IS SPECIFIC AND TIMELY MAKES ME THINK YOU BELIEVE I HAVE GREATER POTENTIAL.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00187	3DDVLOP MODEL STIEN PLOE SPACE DED VAN GOOD
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00188	BUT IGNORING UNPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOR CAN MEAN ROBBING PEOPLE OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO GROW. DENYING PEOPLE A CHANCE TO IMPROVE IN MY OPINION IS SHORTSIGHTED, COWARDOUS AND SELFISH.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00190	INDIVIDUALS WHO BELIEVE THEIR TALENTS CAN BE DEVELOPED THROUGH HARD WORK, GOOD STRATEGIES AND INPUT FROM OTHERS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00192	THEN WE NEED FEEDBACK.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00194	SHARE YOUR KNOWLEDGE I NEED ACCESS TO KNOWLEDGE SO I DON'T WASTE TIME REINVENTING THE WHEEL. WHEN YOU SHARE BOOKS, ARTICLES, STRATEGIES AND IDEAS WITH ME, I FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE THE EXPECTATION I CAN GROW.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00196	I admit that in the past I might not have always shared knowledge so that I could remain the sole expert so that I could feel necessary.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00197	BUT THE FEAR OF BECOMING OBSOLETE IS ONE YOU MUST OVERCOME. LEADERS SHARE KNOWLEDGE. THEY DON'T HIDE IT.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00199	SUCCESS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00201	BEHAVIOR MODEL GOOD BEHAVIOR. WHEN I SEE SOMEONE SUCCESSFULLY COACH OTHERS, COMMUNICATE BAD NEWS TRANSPARENTLY AND WITH COMPASSION OR ASK FOR COMMENTS AND DEAL WITH CRITICAL FEEDBACK WELL, I HAVE EXAMPLES TO COPY FROM.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00203	BE AWARE OF HOW YOUR ATTITUDE AND ACTIONS INFLUENCE OTHERS' PERCEPTIONS OF WHAT IS ACCEPTABLE AND GOOD. MONKEY SEE, MONKEY DO.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00205	SHARE SPACE
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00207	INVITE PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE. IT DOESN'T COME NATURAL TO EVERYONE TO SPEAK UP OR TO STEP INTO NEW SITUATIONS. BUT TESTING NEW THINGS IS IMPORTANT FOR MY GROWTH.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00208	WHEN I AM PUT IN STRETCH OPPORTUNITIES AND WHEN I AM INVITED TO TAKE UP SPACE, THAT BECOMES EASIER.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00210	IF THERE ARE PEOPLE ON YOUR TEAM WHO YOU KNOW ARE CAPABLE OF MORE THAN THEY HAVE SHOWN OR WHO MIGHT HAVE GOOD IDEAS BUT DON'T USUALLY SPEAK UP, YOU CAN CREATE OPENINGS FOR THEM TO PARTICIPATE. INVITE THEM IN THE CONVERSATION.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00211	YOU CAN HELP PEOPLE GET OVER THEIR INSECURITY TO GET OVER THAT THRESHOLD OF SPEAKING UP.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00213	SAYING, HEY, SARAH, DIDN'T YOU HAVE A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE WITH X? WHAT IS YOUR PERSPECTIVE? OR EVAN, I HAVE ONLY HEARD FROM THE USUALS, BUT WHAT ARE THE QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ON THIS TOPIC?
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00215	OUR SUCCESS IS HIGHLY INDEPENDENT ON THAT OF OTHERS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00217	CONNECT CONNECT TO CREATE A SUPPORTIVE COLLECTION COLLECTIVE YOUR WORK CAN BE EMOTIONALLY TAXING THE CRUELTY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00219	SUFFERING OF ANIMALS SEEMS ENDLESS. OUR ACHIEVEMENTS ARE INCREMENTAL.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00221	WE NEED SUPPORT TO CONTINUE TO DO THIS WORK. MORE OVER, IT IS CRITICAL TO PROVIDE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY WHERE PEOPLE CAN OPENLY TALK ABOUT THE THINGS THAT WENT WRONG AND MIGHT GO WRONG.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00222	IF YOU WEREN'T THERE ON FRIDAY, I RECOMMEND YOU WATCH ANIA'S TALK WHO SPOKE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT CREATING PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00224	PEOPLE WON'T SHARE IDEAS IF THEY DO NOT FEEL THEY BELONG.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00226	A COLLECTIVE OF ALLIES. AND HERE I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO DISAGREE A TINY BIT WITH ANYA AND KRISTINA WHO SPOKE ON FRIDAY. I DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO BE FRIENDS WITH THE PEOPLE YOU WORK WITH.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00228	WE ARE LESS LIKE A FAMILY AND MORE LIKE A SPORTS TEAM WITH A COMMON GOAL. FRIEND GROUPS CAN FEEL LIKE CLIQUES WITH OUTSIDERS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00230	I THINK WE NEED ALLIES. PEOPLE YOU CAN DEPEND ON TO HELP YOU DO YOUR BEST WORK. WHO YOU HOLD ACCOUNTABLE AND WHO HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE. YOU HAVE THE MOST IMPORTANT CONNECTION WITH YOUR COLLEAGUES. YOU ALL WANT TO HELP ANIMALS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00232	I DON'T WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO ME BECAUSE WE HAVE THE SAME CULTURAL BACKGROUND BUT BECAUSE I HAVE A GOOD IDEA. AND I NEED YOU TO BE CRITICAL OF MY SUGGESTIONS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00233	AND YOUR OPINION OF THEM SHOULD NOT BE COLORED BY A MUTUAL LOVE FOR THE MUSIC OF JOY DIVISION.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00235	WE NEED TO TRUST THAT WHEN WE DISAGREE, WE DO SO BECAUSE WE WANT TO GET TO A POINT OF BETTER UNDERSTANDING HOW WE CAN IMPROVE LIVES. WE NEED RELATIONSHIPS WE CAN COUNT ON.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00237	TO FORM A COLLECTIVE, A NETWORK OF ALLIES, BUILD ONE-ON-ONE RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, SUPPORT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN OTHER PEOPLE. MAKE INTRODUCTIONS BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO COULD SUPPORT EACH OTHER OR LEARN FROM EACH OTHER.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00239	CHECK IN PEOPLE DO THEIR BEST WORK WHEN THEY FEEL A SENSE OF BELONGING
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00241	TO CREATE THAT INCLUSION FOR MANY THAT MEANS THEY NEED PEOPLE TO CHECK IN WITH THEM ESPECIALLY IN TIMES OF CRISIS. IF YOU ARE A QUEER ADVOCATE IN POLAND RIGHT NOW, YOUR IDENTITY, YOUR EXISTENCE IS BASICALLY THREATENED.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00242	DOING YOUR WORK NOW IS EVEN HARDER THAN NORMAL. SHOW EACH OTHER COMPASSION.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00244	BE KIND AND SUPPORTIVE SEE HOW OTHER PEOPLE ARE DOING AND NOT JUST THE ONES YOU NATURALLY GRAVITATE TOWARDS. REMEMBER THAT YOU HAVE WHAT YOU HAVE IN COMMON AND SHOW UP FOR EACH OTHER.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00246	SPEAK UP FOR EACH OTHER IN TWO WAYS. FIRST, AMPLIFY VOICES, ESPECIALLY MARGINALIZED ONES. IF SOMEONE ISN'T LISTENED TO BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT INCLUDED OR BECAUSE THEY AREN'T AS LOUD OR AS RESPECTED,
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00247	YOU CAN REPEAT THEIR POINTS AND ATTRIBUTE THEIR IDEAS TO THEM. THIS WILL MAKE THEM FEEL HEARD AND PART OF THE TEAM AND BETTER DECISIONS CAN BE MADE.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00249	THEN SPEAK UP FOR EACH OTHER CALL IN BAD BEHAVIOR WHEN SOMEONE USES DISRESPECTFUL LANGUAGE OR SHOWS THEIR BIAS ASK WHAT THEY MEAN OR EXPLAIN WHY IT CAN FEEL HARMFUL
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00250	IF YOU DON'T, YOU GIVE YOUR SILENT APPROVAL AND ENCOURAGE AN ENVIRONMENT OF HARASSMENT.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00252	YOU CAN HELP CREATE A BRAVE SPACE OF BELONGING WHERE ONLY PEOPLE'S IDEAS ARE JUDGED, NOT THEIR IDENTITY.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00254	WHEN I KNOW YOU HAVE MY BACK, IT WILL BE EASIER FOR ME TO SPEAK UP FOR MYSELF AND FOR OTHERS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00256	IF PEOPLE FEEL THEY ARE HAPPY IN THEIR PLACE OF WORK, TURNOVER IS LOW AND MORE PEOPLE WANT TO JOIN YOUR GROUP.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00258	AND YOU DELIVER BETTER WORK AS A COLLECTIVE THAN YOU DO AS A COLLECTION OF INDIVIDUALS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00260	SO ALL THESE FOUR THINGS ARE CONNECTED. EACH OF THE COMPETENCIES SUPPORT AND REINFORCE EACH OTHER.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00262	WITHOUT ASKING QUESTIONS, WITHOUT FULLY UNDERSTANDING WHY OUR METHODS ARE THE BEST AND HOW MONDAIN TASKS RELATE TO THE MISSION, IT IS HARD TO INSPIRE EACH OTHER ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CHANGE THE WORLD.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00263	WITHOUT INSPIRATION WITHOUT BELIEVING YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE WHAT INTEREST DO I HAVE TO DEVELOP AND GROW
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00265	DEVELOP CONNECT PLOEG INSPIRE QUESTION DEI DDD STIEN VAN DEVELOP CONNECT PLOEG INSPIRE QUESTION DEI DDD STIEN VAN DEVELOP CONNECT PLOEG INSPIRE QUESTION DEI DDD STIEN VAN DEVELOP CONNECT PLOEG INSPIRE QUESTION DEI DDD STIEN VAN DEVELOP CONNECT PLOEG INSPIRE QUESTION DEI DDD STIEN VAN DEVELOP CONNECT PLOEG INSPIRE QUESTION DEI DDD STIEN VAN DEVELOP CONNECT PLOEG INSPIRE QUESTION DEI DDD STIEN VAN DEVELOP CONNECT PLOEG INSPIRE QUESTION DEI DDD STIEN VAN DEVELOP CONNECT PLOEG INSPIRE QUESTION DEI DDD STIEN VAN DEVELOP CONNECT PLOEG INSPIRE QUESTION DEI DDD STIEN VAN DEVELOP CON
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00267	AND WITHOUT PEOPLE FEELING LIKE THEY ARE CONNECTED AND VALUED, LIKE THEY ARE JUDGED ON THE VALIDITY OF THEIR IDEAS AND NOT THEIR CHARACTER, THEY WON'T FEEL FREE TO QUESTION THE STRATEGY THAT THE ORGANIZATION IS TAKING.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00269	THERE ARE FOUR SKILLS LISTED IN THE CENTER CIRCLE. COMMUNICATION, CRITICAL THINKING, FEEDBACK, AND DEI STANDS FOR DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSION.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00271	LEARNING ABOUT AND PRACTICING THESE CORE SKILLS WILL HELP YOU GET BETTER AT ACTING ON THE FOUR LEADERSHIP COMPETENCIES AROUND IT. EACH OF THESE FOUR SKILLS DESERVE THEIR OWN FULL TASK, IF NOT FULL DAY MULTI-SESSIONS.

YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00276	BE AS EFFECTIVE AS ORGANIZATIONS AND AS A MOVEMENT WITHOUT REPRESENTATION ON OUR TEAMS OF THE DIVERSITY OF PEOPLE.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00277	EFFECTIVE STIEN
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00279	DIVERSITY TO ME MEANS PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT IDENTITIES AND WAYS OF THINKING ARE REPRESENTED. IN EQUITY PEOPLE HAVE WHAT THEY NEED TO THRIVE. IN INCLUSION PEOPLE ARE HEARD AND FEEL LIKE THEY BELONG.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00281	I ALSO BELIEVE THAT IT IS NOT JUST IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN OUR ANIMAL ADVOCACY. I THINK IT IS OUR MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO CREATE EQUITY.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00282	IF WE ARE APATHETIC TO INJUSTICE AND DON'T STAND UP FOR PEOPLE WHO MIGHT NOT BE IN THE ROOM, WE CONSENT TO THE STATUS QUO OF OPPRESSION.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00284	THERE ARE MANY FORMS OF EXCLUSION PLAGING OUR MOVEMENT, SEXISM, ABLEISM, HETERONORMATIVITY, BUT I WANT TO CALL OUT IN PARTICULAR ANTI-BLACKNESS AND THE NEED TO INCORPORATE ANTI-RECISM IN OUR WORK.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00285	I RECOMMEND YOU SEEK OUT ENCOMPASS MOVEMENT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW TO CREATE RACIAL JUSTICE IN THE ANIMAL ADVOCACY SPACE.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00287	ALSO WANT TO SHOW YOU HOW I THINK DEI THESE THREE CONCEPTS ARE IMPORTANT FOR THE FOUR COMPETENCIES I DISCUSSED
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00289	QUESTIONING.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00290	NUMEROUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT DIVERSITY ON YOUR TEAMS CAN CREATE A WORK CULTURE THAT IS BETTER AT MAKING MORE INFORMED DECISIONS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00292	EQUITY EQUITY REPRESENTED JUSTICE EQUITY REPRESENTED JUSTICE EQUITY REPRESENTED JUSTICE EQUITY REPRESENTED JUSTICE EQUITY REPRESENTED JUSTICE EQUITY REPRESENTED JUSTICE EQUITY REPRESENTED JUSTICE EQUITY REPRESENTED JUSTICE EQUITY REPRESENTED JUSTICE EQUITY REPRESENTED JUSTICE EQUITY REPRESENTED JUSTICE EQUITY REPRESENTED JUSTICE EQUITY REPRESENTED JUSTICE EQUITY REPRESENTED JUSTICE EQUITY REPRESENTED JUSTICE EQUITY REPRESENTED JUSTICE EQUITY REPRESENTED JUSTICE EQUITY REPRESENTED JUSTICE EQUITY REPRESENTED JUSTICE EQUITY REPRESENTED JUSTICE EQUITY REPRESENTED JUSTICE EQUITY REPRESENTED JUSTICE E
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00294	EQUITY EQUITY EQUITY EQUITY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00295	BUT IDEAS ARE CONSIDERED FROM MORE ANGLES.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00297	ENCOURAGING DIVERSITY BOTH COGNITIVE AND IDENTITY BASED WILL ENCOURAGE MORE QUESTIONS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00299	THEN INSPIRE
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00301	WE NEED TO INSPIRE EVERYONE ON OUR TEAMS TO DELIVER OUR BEST WORK. IT WILL BE VERY HARD TO MOTIVATE PEOPLE THAT WE CAN FIGHT THIS MASSIVE BATTLE TOGETHER IF SOME ARE EXCLUDED AND FEEL LIKE THEY DO NOT BELONG.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00303	DEVELOPMENT
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00305	PEOPLE OF COLOR AND OTHER MARGINALIZED PERSONS ARE OFTEN LESS LIKELY TO SUCCEED BECAUSE THEY HAVE LESS ACCESS TO LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES AND MENTORSHIP WHILE AT THE SAME TIME THEY ARE FORCED TO LIVE UP TO HIGHER STANDARDS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00307	CONNECTING AS A TEAM MEMBER YOU CAN HELP CREATE A SENSE OF INCLUSION AND WITHOUT INCLUSION PEOPLE WILL NOT FEEL FREE TO SHARE THEIR IDEAS NOR WILL PEOPLE BE OPEN TO LISTENING TO YOURS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00308	LEARN TO RECOGNIZE THE WAY BIAS INFLUENCES BEHAVIOR AND HOW IT SEEP INTO ORGANIZATIONAL SYSTEMS SO YOU CAN CHANGE THEM.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00310	EQUITY EQUITY EQUITY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00312	THIS WILL HELP YOU INCORPORATE ANTI-OPPRESSION IN YOUR LEADERSHIP.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00314	EFFECTIVE WITHOUT IT WE WON'T HAVE JUSTICE WE ARE ALL ANIMALS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00316	IN SUMMARY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00318	YOU CAN MAKE AN IMPACT ON YOUR COWORKERS OR AND YOUR ORGANIZATION AND YOUR MISSION IRRESPECTIVE OF YOUR AUTHORITY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00320	QUESTION HOW PEOPLE AND PLANS IN YOUR ORGANIZATION LEAD TO BETTER LIVES FOR ANIMALS ASK CRITICAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DIRECTION OF YOUR ORGANIZATION
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00322	INSPIRE PEOPLE YOU WORK WITH SHOW THEM DIFFERENCE YOUR HEART WORK TOGETHER MAKES FOR ANIMALS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00324	DEVELOP IMPACT SUPPORT GROWTH CONNECT BUILD RELATIONSHIPS MAKE SURE INDIVIDUALS FEEL LIKE THEY BELONG
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00326	So
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00328	That is the majority of all I wanted to share with you today. So what's left is some questions I have for you, hoping that we can all learn from each other's experience.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00329	I HAVE THREE QUESTIONS FOR YOU.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00330	THERE SHOULD BE TIME FOR YOUR SLIDE OUT QUESTIONS. SO WHICH ONE OF MY IDEAS WILL YOU TRY OUT?
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00332	I'M GOING TO REMAIN UNCOMFORTABLY QUIET UNTIL SOMEONE SPEAKS UP OR CHATS UP. BIANCA OR MONICA, IF YOU'RE STILL HERE, COULD YOU HELP ME READ IF THERE'S ANY CHATS?
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00334	OK, everyone. So I just want to encourage you, as Stine said before, to answer her questions in the chat. Or if you have any questions, you can ask through Slido.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00336	AND LUKAS SAYS, VOICE CONCERNS OR QUESTIONS EVEN MORE ACTIVELY.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00338	SOFIA SAYS, REPEATING QUIET PEOPLE'S IDEAS AND ATTRIBUTING THEM TO THAT PERSON.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00340	NATALIE, CELEBRATE SMALL VICTORIES FOR THE ANIMALS MORE.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00342	FMYI QUESTIONS TRY TO FMYI QUESTIONS TRY TO SUPPORT FMYI QUESTIONS TRY TO SUPPORT OTHER FMYI QUESTIONS TRY TO SUPPORT OTHER PEOPLE'S FMYI QUESTIONS TRY TO SUPPORT OTHER PEOPLE'S GROWTH.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00344	Matthew says he's gonna try celebrating small milestones and giving people feedback
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00346	So let me see what time it is.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00348	THEN NEXT QUESTION, WHICH ONE OF MY IDEAS WILL BE CHALLENGING FOR YOU OR MAYBE WHAT ARE SOME IDEAS THAT YOU DON'T AGREE WITH?
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00350	THINK I SHOULD CHANGE MY MIND ABOUT.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00352	I don't see anyone that would write something right now in the group chat. Maybe it's not that challenging.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00353	YEAH
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00355	MAYBE FOR EXAMPLE FOR ME, ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING THINGS ARE PREVENT THE BURNOUT AND
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00357	WELL, DOING MOST OF THESE THINGS AND ENGAGE EVERY DAY. OKAY. AND WE HAVE THE FIRST GIVEN MORE FROM NATHALIE. GIVEN MORE FEEDBACK IS CHALLENGING BUT VERY IMPORTANT.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00359	QUESTIONS CHALLENGING TRY HU FYI THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00361	I THINK YOU CAN BE TOO ANNOYING. IT CAN SLOW A PROCESS IF EVERYONE IS CRITICAL OF EVERYTHING ALL THE TIME.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00363	QUESTIONS CHALLENGING HU FYI TRY TO QUESTIONS CHALLENGING HU FYI TRY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS CHALLENGING HU FYI TRY TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS CHALLENGING HU FYI TRY TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS CHALLENGING HU FYI TRY TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS CHALLENGING HU FYI TRY TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS CHALLENGING HU FYI TRY TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS CHALLENGING HU FYI TRY TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS CHALLENGING HU FYI TRY TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS CHALLENGING HU FYI TRY TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS CHALLENGING HU FYI TRY TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS CHALLENGING HU FYI TRY TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS CHALLENGING HU FYI TRY TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS CHALLENGING HU
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00365	EXACTLY, FEEDBACK IS DEFINITELY THE MOST CHALLENGING.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00367	I have to agree with that. I think for me also, both giving and receiving feedback is difficult and there is a lot to learn for that.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00369	THEN LAST QUESTION, SOMETHING THAT IN THE QUESTIONNAIRE OR I THINK THE SURVEY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00370	TRY TO GET THEM TO DO THEIR JOB.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00371	TRY TO GET THEM TO TALK TO ME.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00373	OKAY SO AGAIN WE HAVE SOME MORE COMMENTS FROM TANIA GOOD COMMUNICATION ALL COMES DOWN TO LISTENING
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00374	QUESTIONS CHALLENGING MEAN GOOD HU TRY FYI DOES AND QUESTIONS CHALLENGING MEAN GOOD HU TRY FYI DOES AND THEN QUESTIONS CHALLENGING MEAN GOOD HU TRY FYI DOES AND THEN FROM QUESTIONS CHALLENGING MEAN GOOD HU TRY FYI DOES AND THEN FROM ISHITA QUESTIONS CHALLENGING MEAN GOOD HU TRY FYI DOES AND THEN FROM ISHITA AND QUESTIONS CHALLENGING MEAN GOOD HU TRY FYI DOES AND THEN FROM ISHITA AND I AND THEN FROM ISHITA AND I AND THEN FROM ISHITA AND I DIDN'T AND THEN FROM ISHITA AND I DIDN'T KNOW AND THEN FROM ISHITA AND I DIDN'T KNOW IF AND THEN FROM ISHITA AND I DIDN'T KNOW IF I AND THEN FROM ISHITA AND I DIDN'T KNOW IF I PRONOUNCED AND THEN FROM ISH
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00375	QUESTIONS CHALLENGING GOOD MEAN HU TRY FYI DOES THEN FROM MIKA POSITIONING YOURSELF AT THE SAME LEVEL AS OTHERS?
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00377	NETALI HAVE A REALLY CLEAR PURPOSE BEING ABLE TO EXPLAIN WHY WE ARE DOING CERTAIN THINGS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00379	AND FROM LINA THAT THERE ARE NO MISUNDERSTANDINGS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00381	I THINK THOSE ARE ALL VERY GREAT POINTS.

YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00002	Hi, I'm Pete Sinden, Chief Information Officer at Genomics England, and today I'm here to discuss how research is being used to deliver personalised care.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00004	Genomics is a groundbreaking area of medicine. It uses a person's unique genetic code to help diagnose, treat, and prevent illness.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00005	Advanced technology now lets scientists compare genetic code across thousands of people to make new discoveries and continually improve healthcare.

YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00008	THROUGHOUT THE EARLY YEARS OF HER LIFE SHE'S BEEN GIVEN MRI'S LUMBER PUNCTURES EEGS TO MEASURE BRAIN WAVES AND MANY OTHER DIAGNOSTICS NONE OF WHICH REVEALED HER PARTICULAR CONDITION
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00010	THROUGH THE 100,000 GENOME PROJECT JESSICA RECEIVED A DIAGNOSIS GENOMICS PINPOINTED A CHANGE TO ONE OF HER GENES THAT WAS NOT PRESENT IN EITHER OF HER PARENTS THEY NOW KNOW THAT JESSICA HAS GLUT1 DEFICIENCY SYNDROME
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00011	GLUCOSE FROM THE BLOOD TO THE FLUID AROUND THE BRAIN
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00013	BUT JESSICA CAN NOW CONTROL HER EPILEPSY BY ADOPTING A SPECIAL KETOGENIC DIET LOWING CARBOHYDRATES AND HIGH IN PROTEIN
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00014	DISUNDERSTANDING DIRECTLY IMPROVED THE LIFE OF A CHILD APPLYING PROCESS SCALE CAN IMPROVE LIVES OF MANY CHILDREN AND ADULTS ALIKE
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00016	FURTHERMORE THE PARENTS NOW KNOW THAT THE CONDITION WAS NOT INHERITED IF THEY DECIDE TO HAVE MORE CHILDREN THEY WILL NOT HAVE THE SAME CONDITION ESSENTIAL FOR THEIR PEACE OF MIND
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00018	RARE DISEASE IS VERY COMMON.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00020	EACH DISEASE IS INDIVIDUALLY RARE THERE ARE OVER 7000 RARE DISEASES
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00022	COLLECTIVELY ONE OF 17 PEOPLE HAS A RARE DISEASE AND THAT REPRESENTS OVER 400 MILLION PEOPLE GLOBALLY
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00024	80% OF RARE DISEASES HAVE A GENETIC CAUSE PATIENTS WILL WAIT ON AVERAGE FOUR YEARS FOR DIAGNOSIS AND 95% OF THEM WILL HAVE NO APPROVED TREATMENT
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00026	THIS IS AN AREA OF MEDICINE WITH A SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL FOR ADVANCING SCIENCE AND IMPROVING LIVES THIS IS WHY RARE DISEASE WAS A MAJOR FOCUS OF THE 100,000 GENOME PROJECT FOR WHICH GENOMICS ENGLAND WAS ORIGINALLY ESTABLISHED
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00028	INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH TO FURTHER UNDERSTAND AND TREAT THESE CONDITIONS IS CRITICAL AND HIGH IMPACT GENOMICS ENGLAND SITS AT THE HEART OF THE UK'S ECOSYSTEM IN ENABLING GENOMIC RESEARCH AND MAKING GENOMICS CLINICALLY ACCESSIBLE
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00029	WE WORK ALONGSIDE FRIENDS IN THE UK MEDICAL FAMILY FROM NHS ENGLAND TO BIOPHARMA HDR UK AND NIHR
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00030	OUR SYSTEMS ARE USED BY SEVERAL THOUSAND ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS BY BIOTECH AND BY PHARMA
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00032	WE HAVE DEEP TECHNICAL AND GENOMIC SPECIALIST PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE LIKES OF AWS LIFEBIT ILLUMINA CONGENICA NVIDIA AND OXFORD NANOPORE
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00034	WE EXIST IN PART THROUGH CENTRAL GOVERNMENT FUNDING AND IN PART THROUGH RESEARCH FUNDING
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00036	GENOMICS ENGLAND IS A KEY FACILITATOR IN THE TRANSITION TO PERSONALIZED PREDICTIVE AND PREVENTATIVE GENOMIC HEALTHCARE
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00038	WE WORK WITH THE NHS TO DELIVER AND IMPROVE GENOMIC TESTING THAT HELPS DOCTORS DIAGNOSE TREAT AND PREVENT ILLNESS STARTING WITH CANCER AND RARE DISEASE
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00039	A MINIMUM OF 20,000 WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCES ARE EXPECTED TO BE PROCESSED DURING 2021.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00041	AT THE SAME TIME WE PROVIDE HEALTH DATA AND ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY NEEDED BY RESEARCHERS TO MAKE NEW MEDICAL DISCOVERIES AND DEVELOP MORE EFFECTIVE TARGETED MEDICINES FOR PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES

YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00047	THIS SLIDE SHOWS THAT GENOMICS DOESN'T JUST APPLY TO RARE DISEASE. THIS SLIDE RELATES TO CANCER.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00049	IN THIS INSTANCE, AN INDIVIDUAL PRESENTED WITH A BRAIN TUMOR. BUT THE CLINICIAN SUSPECTED THE BRAIN TUMOR WAS NOT THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF THE CANCER. BY ANALYZING TUMOR MUTATION BURDEN, WHICH IS A MEASURE OF THE MUTATIONS IN THE DNA OF THE CANCER CELLS,
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00050	INDICATIONS IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IN THE L
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00052	BY FURTHER ANALYZING TRANSVERSIONS A PROCESS WHERE BY C BASES A CHANGE TO A BASES IN THE GENOMIC CODE IT WAS POSSIBLE TO SHOW THAT THE LIKELY CAUSE WAS DNA DAMAGE FROM INHALING BENZOPRENE BENZOPRENES ARE CARCIGEN PREVALENT IN CIGARETTE SMOKE
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00054	BY USING THESE TWO TECHNIQUES TOGETHER, THE PRIMARY DISEASE TYPE WAS IDENTIFIED AS LUNG CANCER AND IN THIS INSTANCE WAS TREATABLE WITH IMMUNOTHERAPY, STIMULATING THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO KILL THE CANCER CELLS.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00057	THROUGH THE 100,000 GENOME PROJECT, OVER 110,000 GENOMES HAVE BEEN CONTRIBUTED BY APPROXIMATELY 90,000 PARTICIPANTS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00058	OVER 70,000 OF THOSE RELATE TO RARE DISEASE FROM THE INDIVIDUALS AFFECTIVE AND IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES FROM THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00059	OVER 17000 CANCER PATIENTS HAVE CONTRIBUTED BOTH GERMLINE AND TUMOUR SEQUENCES OVER THE LAST YEAR INDIVIDUALS HAVE ALSO CONTRIBUTED GENOMES TO HELP UNDERSTAND COVID-19 AND THE VARIATION IN SEVERITY OF THE DISEASE
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00060	THIS IS BUILDING TO AN ADDITIONAL 35,000 GENOMES
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00062	THE GENOMIC DATA SITS ALONGSIDE CLINICALLY RELEVANT DATA TO RERIDE A RICH PHENOTYPIC GENOTYPIC ENVIRONMENT FOR DETAILED ANALYSIS
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00063	CLINICAL DATA INCLUDES HOSPITAL EPISODE STATISTICS MORTALITY DATA A RANGE OF CANCER SPECIFIC INFORMATION AND EXIT QUESTIONNAIRES FROM CLINICIANS INDICATING FOR EXAMPLE WHETHER SPECIFIC VARIANTS COULD EXPLAIN THE PHENOTYPE
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00065	IN SOME INSTANCES IMAGING AND PRIMARY CARE DATA ARE ALSO LINKED
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00067	THIS SLIDE SHOWS THE SPREAD OF GENOMES BETWEEN RARE DISEASE TYPES THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS RELATING TO NEUROLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT DISORDERS ALONG WITH MANY OTHER CLASSES OF DISEASE
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00069	WHEN LOGGED INTO OUR RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT THESE CAN BE EXPLORED AND SEGMENTED IN MANY WAYS TO FIND THE RIGHT COHORT OF PARTICIPANTS FOR YOUR PARTICULAR STUDY
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00071	AND THIS SLIDE SHOWS THE SPREAD OF PARTICIPANTS BY CANCER TYPE AS EXPECTED YOU SEE GREATER NUMBERS OF THE MORE PREVALENT BREAST COLORECTAL AND LUNG CANCERS CANCER PATIENTS COVER BOTH SOMATIC MUTATIONS THOSE THAT OCCUR FROM DAMAGE TO GENES
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00072	IN AN INDIVIDUAL DURING THE PERSON'S LIFE AND GERMLINE MUTATIONS THOSE THAT ARE PASSED ON DIRECTLY FROM A PARENT TO A CHILD AT THE TIME OF CONCEPTION
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00074	FOLLOWING THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF 100,000 GENOME PROJECT GENOMICS ENGLAND HAS UNDERGONE A TRANSFORMATION FROM PROJECT TO PLATFORM OUR NEXT CHAPTER INVOLVES WORKING WITH PATIENTS DOCTORS AND SCIENTISTS TO IMPROVE THE GENOMIC TESTING IN THE NHS
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00075	AND HELP RESEARCHERS ACCESS THE HEALTH DATA AND TECHNOLOGY THEY NEED TO MAKE NEW MEDICAL DISCOVERIES AND CREATE MORE EFFECTIVE TARGETED MEDICINES FOR EVERYBODY.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00077	THE MORE GENOMES ARE ANALYZED, THE MORE DISCOVERIES CAN BE MADE AND THE BETTER FUTURE CARE WILL BE. OUR TRANSITION FROM SELF-MANAGED INFRASTRUCTURE TO AWS CLOUD IS AN ESSENTIAL ENABLER IN SCALING OUR OFFERING TO ENABLE SUCH RESEARCH.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00079	RESEARCHERS CAN ACCESS THE GENOMIC AND CLINICAL DATA OUTLAND ABOVE BY USING GENOMIC ENGLAND'S TRUSTED RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT GEL HAS PARTNERED WITH INNOVATIVE BRITISH DEEP TECH COMPANY LIFEBIT AND IS USING GLOBAL CLOUD PROVIDER AWS TO POWER THE PLATFORM
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00080	PLATFORM PROVIDES ACCESS TO TOOLING REQUIRED TO DEFINE AND EXPLORE A COHORT OF INDIVIDUALS BASED ON GENOMIC OR PHENOTYPIC STRATIFICATION.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00081	THE PLATFORM ENABLES DATA EXPLORATION AND MAKES IT SIMPLE FOR RESEARCHERS TO EXECUTE PIPELINES AND OTHER JOBS.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00083	RESEARCHERS CAN INTRODUCE CUTTING EDGE ANALYTICAL TOOLS OF THEIR CHOICE THROUGH DOCU CONTAINERS LINK THOSE TOOLS SECURELY WITH THEIR OWN DATA
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00084	AND CONDUCT RESEARCH ACROSS ALL DATA SOURCES IN PRIVATE WORKSPACES THAT ARE AUDITED PROTECTED AND CONTROLLED BY GEL'S STRICT INFORMATION GOVERNANCE POLICIES
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00086	BUT WHY USE RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00088	IN ADDITION TO PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY THERE ARE FOUR KEY REASONS TO USE THE TRUSTED RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT FIRSTLY THE DATA SETS INVOLVED ARE ENORMOUS
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00089	THE DATA IS TOO BIG TO MOVE EFFICIENTLY IT CANNOT READILY BE ACHIEVED WITH A SENSIBLE TIME FRAME OR COST AS THE DATA GROWS THIS BECOMES AN EVER INCREASING CONSTRAINT
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00090	BY WAY OF EXAMPLE WHEN GENOMICS INGDON MOVED ITS OWN DATA FROM ONE STORAGE SYSTEM TO ANOTHER IT TOOK NINE MONTHS FOR THE FULL COPY
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00092	SECONDLY TECHNOLOGY NOW MAKES IT RELATIVELY SIMPLE TO BRING THE ANALYTICS TO THE DATA INCREASING SPEED AND LURING COST THIS IS BECOMING A COMMON PARADIGM FOR DISTRIBUTED ANALYSIS OF VERY LARGE DATA SETS
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00094	THROUGH LIFEBITS CLOUD OS EACH RESEARCHER RECEIVES THEIR OWN CLEAN ROOM ENVIRONMENT SEPARATE TO ANY OTHER FROM WHICH THEY CAN ACCESS ALL OF THE GENOMICS ENGLAND'S DATA ALONGSIDE THEIR OWN DATA
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00095	THE FULLY MANUFRIED SERVICE PROVIDES MAXIMUM UTILITY WITHOUT SACRIFICING SECURITY OR CONTROL
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00097	THIRDLY INVESTING IN HARDWARE AND ESTABLISHING ENVIRONMENT IS A DRAG ON INNOVATION IT'S NOT A GOOD USE OF TIME FOR DATA SCIENTISTS OR BY INFOMATICIANS
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00099	AND LASTLY THE COMMON ENVIRONMENT ENABLES READY COLLABORATION BETWEEN RESEARCH TEAMS WHILE EACH HAS THEIR OWN ENVIRONMENT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO COLLABORATE WHEREVER THEY WISH
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00101	CLOUD BRINGS SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES TO RESEARCH
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00103	YOU CAN BEGIN RAPIDLY WITH NO NEED TO PURCHASE, INSTALL OR MANAGE HARDWARE BY PIGGYBACKING ON AN ESTABLISHED RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT YOU CAN SCALE RESEARCH IMMEDIATELY WITH ALL SECURITY, IDENTITY MANAGEMENT AND DATA INGESTION READY AND WAITING
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00105	A WELL-GOVERNED CLOUD PLATFORM IS MORE SECURE THAN SELF-MANAGED INFRASTRUCTURE
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00106	A PAY-AS-YOU-GO MODEL MEANS YOU ONLY NEED TO PAY FOR WHAT YOU USE
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00107	DATA BECOMES SIMPLER INTEGRATING DATA SECURELY FEDERATION ACROSS ENVIRONMENTS IS A CRITICAL DIRECTION OF TRAVEL AND WE FULLY SUPPORT THE EFFORTS OF THE GFGH COMMUNITY
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00109	THE CLOUD PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT 11 NINES RESILIENCE THIS ALLOWS US TO DIVERT MORE EFFORT INTO ENABLING GENOMIC RESEARCH OVER MANAGING PLATFORM STABILITY
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00111	IN A WORLD WHERE GENOMICS IS AT THE BLEEDING EDGE OF HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTE WE CAN ALWAYS BENEFIT FROM THE LATEST AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY WITHOUT BEING CONCERNED WITH CAPITAL INVESTMENT AND DEPRECIATION LIFE CYCLES
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00113	WHILE THE BENEFITS OF CLOUD ARE UNDENIABLE THERE'S A JOURNEY TO SETTING UP A HIGH FUNCTIONING ANALYTICS PLATFORM GENOMICS ENGLAND WE'VE MADE THE INVESTMENT SO THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00114	CHALLENGES SOME CHALLENGES WE HAVE ADDRESSED ARE SUCH
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00116	HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING IS A SPECIALIZED END OF COMPUTING WITH HELP OF INTEL AND AWS WE TACKLED THE PERFORMANCE AND CONFIGURATION QUESTIONS HEAD ON
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00118	INTEL SUPPORT ENABLED US TO EMBED ARCHITECTURAL CHANGES FROM WHICH ALL USERS NOW BENEFIT
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00120	WE LOOKED AT SEVERAL CLASSES OF COMMON JOBS A SIMPLE GWAS A STANDARD GENOMIC FUNCTION SORE A FIVE FOLD IMPROVEMENT IN SPEED AND A TEN FOLD REDUCTION IN COST
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00122	ON AN OUT OF THE BOX CONFIGURATION A COMPLEX BUT FREQUENT JOB TOOK 25 HOURS TO RUN
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00123	AFTER OUR INVESTMENT WE WERE ABLE TO REDUCE THE COMPUTE TIME FROM 25 HOURS TO 23 SECONDS THIS IS A GENERIC IMPROVEMENT FOR ALL SUCH WORKLOADS
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00125	THIS INVESTMENT THAT WE PUT IN ALONGSIDE OUR PARTNERS MATTERS FOR ALL FUTURE RESEARCH AND COSTS OF RESEARCH ARE BASED ON INSTANCE TYPE SELECTED AND COMPUTE TIME USED
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00127	MIGRATING EXISTING SERVICES IS A NON-TRIVIAL MATTER THROUGH OUR CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH AWS MIGRATION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WE'VE PLANNED THE MOVE OF COMPLEX INTERDEPENDENT SERVICES RUNNING OVER NEARLY 1,000 VIRTUAL MACHINES
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00129	FINAL CHALLENGE IS THE FUNDING MODEL WHILE COMMERCIAL ENTITIES SEE THE BENEFIT OF PAY-AS-YOU-GO SERVICES THE ACADEMIC GRANT FUNDING MECHANISM IS LESS READY FOR THE CONCEPT WE'RE LOOKING TO SEE HOW TO BEST MANAGE THAT WITH OUR PARTNERS THROUGH THE OFFERATING MODEL AND POTENTIALLY WITH CENTRALIZED FUNDING
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00131	TO WRAP UP WE ARE NOW AT A POINT WHERE WE HAVE PROVEN THE VALUE IN GENOMIC ANALYSIS AND ARE SEEING WHOLE GDM SEQUENCING BEING EMBEDDED IN CLINICAL PATHWAYS
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00132	THROUGH A YEAR OF COVID GENOMICS HAS ENTERED THE COMMON LANGUAGE THE NEXT PHASE IS SCALING WITH MORE DATA WE CAN COLLECTIVELY CONDUCT MORE ANALYSES AND GENERATE NEW PERSONALIZED THERAPEUTICS DIAGNOSTICS AND PREVENTATIVE TREATMENTS
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00133	THE POTENTIAL GLOBAL IMPACT IS ENORMOUS OUR ENVIRONMENTS ARE ESTABLISHED NOT SO THAT WE CAN CONDUCT RESEARCH BUT SO THAT YOU CAN

YTB+95QidsysvhM+00006	AND WE ARE FROM PIT DANCE MARATHON AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IMPLEMENTING EFFECTIVE STEWARDSHIP FOR YOUR DANCE MARATHON.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00008	IN OUR PRESENTATION WE TALK ABOUT THE TWO PRONGED APPROACH WE TAKE AT PDM TO DONOR STEWARDSHIP INCLUDING STEWARDING AS AN ORGANIZATION AND STEWARDING AS FOR INDIVIDUALS.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00009	EXAMPLES OF BOTH OF THOSE AND WHAT WE DID IN OUR PROGRAM THIS YEAR AND THEN WAYS THAT OTHER DANCE MARATHONS CAN IMPLEMENT THEM AND THOSE METHODS INTO THEIR PROGRAMS IN THE FUTURE.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00011	SO WE TAKE A TWO PRONGED APPROACH TO
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00013	STEWARDING IN TERMS OF THAT FROM AN INDIVIDUAL POINT OF VIEW AND NOT FROM AN ORGANIZATIONAL STANDPOINT.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00014	INDIVIDUAL STEWARDSHIP REFERS TO RESOURCES AND PLANS IMPLEMENTED FOR PARTICIPANTS AND STAFF MEMBERS TO USE WHERE THEY THEMSELVES ARE ENCOURAGED TO THANK THOSE WHO HAVE DONATED TO THEIR FUNDRAISING EFFORTS.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00015	SO THIS INCLUDES TEMPLATES AND OUTLINES THAT WE PROVIDE TO EVERY INDIVIDUAL INVOLVED IN PDM TO SEND OUT ONCE THEY RECEIVE DONATIONS FROM DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00016	AND THEN ORGANIZATIONAL STEWARDSHIP WHICH REFERS TO THE STEWARDING EFFORTS THAT ARE DONE ON BEHALF OF ALL OF PIT DANCE MARATHONS.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00017	SO THIS INCLUDES EMAILS SENT OUT FROM PDM TO ALL DONORS TO SPECIFIC CATEGORIES OF DONORS THAT SORT OF THING.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00019	YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING WHY WE DO THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND REALLY IT'S BECAUSE IT COVERS THAT ALL OF THE BASES. SO SOME PEOPLE DONATE BECAUSE THEY'RE SUPPORTING THE PERSON THAT'S RAISING THE MONEY.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00020	BUT OTHER PEOPLE MAY DONATE BECAUSE THEY REALLY JUST WANT TO SUPPORT THE CAUSE NO MATTER WHO THE FUNDRAISER IS.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00021	SO FOR MONEY DONORS IT'S A COMBINATION OF THE TWO SO USING THIS TWO PRONGED APPROACH CHANGES THE FORM OF THANK YOU THAT WILL BE MOST EFFECTIVE FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL DONOR
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00022	SO THOSE THAT DONATED TO SUPPORT THE INDIVIDUAL FUNDRAISER WILL TYPICALLY FEEL MORE TOUCHED AND APPRECIATED WHENEVER THAT PERSON REACHES OUT TO THEM DIRECTLY.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00023	EFFECTIVE COVERS ACCOMMODATE BASES CONSIDER DISPERSES EFFECTIVE COVERS ACCOMMODATE BASES CONSIDER DISPERSES EFFECTIVE COVERS ACCOMMODATE BASES CONSIDER DISPERSES EFFECTIVE COVERS ACCOMMODATE BASES CONSIDER DISPERSES EFFECTIVE COVERS ACCOMMODATE BASES CONSIDER DISPERSES EFFECTIVE COVERS ACCOMMODATE BASES CONSIDER DISPERSES EFFECTIVE COVERS ACCOMMODATE BASES CONSIDER DISPERSES EFFECTIVE COVERS ACCOMMODATE BASES CONSIDER DISPERSES EFFECTIVE COVERS ACCOMMODATE BASES CONSIDER DISPERSES EFFECTIVE COVERS
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00024	BUT THOSE MORE ATTACHED TO THE ENTIRE CAUSE OF DANCE MARATHONS WILL REALLY APPRECIATE THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THEIR CONTRIBUTION FROM THE ENTIRE ORGANIZATION.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00025	APPRECIATING THE OVERALL THANK YOU AS WELL AS ANY UPDATES FROM THE ORGANIZATION OR NEW INFORMATION WE CAN PROVIDE THEM FOLLOWING THEIR DONATION.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00026	RESPONSIBILITY IN WORKLOAD STEWARDSHIP ENCOURAGES STAFF MEMBERS AND PARTICIPANTS TO MAKE THE EFFORTS OF THANKING DONORS.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00027	SO THAT THE STEWARDSHIP CHAIR OR COMMITTEE OR WHATEVER YOU MAY HAVE AT YOUR DANCE MARATHON ISN'T AS RESPONSIBLE FOR SENDING OUT INDIVIDUAL TEXT MESSAGES OR THANK YOU'S TO EACH SINGLE DONOR.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00028	THIS WOULDN'T BE AS EFFECTIVE ANYWAY BECAUSE WHOEVER IS IN CHARGE OF STEWARDSHIP WON'T KNOW EACH AND EVERY DONOR AS WELL AS EACH FUNDRAISER WILL. SO THIS MAKES IT WAY MORE IMPACTFUL AND PERSONALIZED.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00030	So focusing on stewarding as an organization, one of the main goals and main items in terms of stewarding as an organization is the high level of consistency in organizational skills.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00031	BECAUSE OF THE QUANTITY OF INDIVIDUALS, GROUPS AND COMPANIES TO BE THANKED. SO DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF YOUR DANCE MARATHON, THERE ARE HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF DONORS IN A GIVEN YEAR.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00032	DONORS TO PULL OUT A REQUEST FOR DONOR DRIVE WHICH IS AN EXTREMELY LARGE LIST OF NAMES TO KEEP TRACK OF AND STAY ON TOP OF THANKING SO WE FOUND THAT IT'S SUPER IMPORTANT TO CREATE AND MAINTAIN A ROBUST LIST OF DONORS BY PULLING FREQUENT REPORTS FROM DONOR DRIVE TO KEEP TRACK OF ALL OF THE DONORS
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00033	SO WE TYPICALLY FIND IT MOST USEFUL TO ORGANIZE THESE DONORS INTO DIFFERENT CATEGORIES.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00034	CREATING EXCEL SPREADSHEETS BASED ON CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS THOSE WHO HAVE DONATED MULTIPLE TIMES, THOSE WHO HAVE DONATED OVER $100, DIFFERENT KIND OF CHARACTERISTICS LIKE THAT.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00035	AND SO IT'S EXTREMELY HELPFUL IN BREAKING ALL OF THIS DOWN TO KEEP TRACK OF EACH INDIVIDUAL'S DIFFERENT CONTRIBUTIONS AND THEN CREATING THIS ROBUST LIST THAT YOU MAINTAIN AND CAN SOURCE FROM DONOR DRIVE
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00036	EASILY ALLOWS YOU TO PERSONALIZE EMAILS THAT WILL BE GOING TO GROUPS SO EVEN THOUGH IT'S JUST THE ORGANIZATION SENDING A MASS EMAIL SO TO SPEAK SO YOU STILL WILL BE SENDING AN EMAIL TO MAYBE A FEW HUNDRED PEOPLE AT ONE TIME
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00037	THEM TO PAY FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THEM
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00038	AND GIVES THE CAUSE SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU BREAK IT DOWN INTO WHO DONATED $50 WHO DONATED DONATED $100 WHO DONATED TWO TO $200 AND ET CETERA
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00039	THIS GIVES YOU SMALLER COHORTS OF DONORS SO YOU CAN PROVIDE THEM INFORMATION ON HOW MUCH THEIR DONATION WILL SUPPORT THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OR CHILDREN'S MIRACLE NETWORK FOR EXAMPLE SO
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00040	YOU CAN INCLUDE MORE PERSONALIZED DETAILS SUCH AS AS A DONOR OF OVER $50 YOU WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE X TO A CHILD AT THE HOSPITAL.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00041	AND THIS IN GENERAL JUST GETS THEM MORE CONNECTED TO THE CAUSE AND ALLOWS THEM TO SEE WHAT TYPE OF IMPACT THEIR DONATIONS ARE HAVING.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00042	A LARGE COHORTS OF DONORS.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00044	AND WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT IS TO GET CREATIVE. THE MORE CREATIVE THAT YOUR ORGANIZATION CAN GET IN WAYS OF THANKING AND STEWARDING DONORS, THE MORE EXCITING IT IS FOR THOSE DONORS.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00045	THEY DON'T NECESSARILY JUST WANT AN EMAIL THAT SAYS THANK YOU FOR DONATING TO OUR DANCE MARATHON THEY REALLY LIKE UNIQUE THINGS IT HELPS THEM FEEL MORE APPRECIATED AND MORE RECOGNIZED
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00046	PERSONALIZING EMAILS FOR DIFFERENT GROUPS LIKE THIS IS ONE OF THE EASIEST WAYS TO IMPROVE ON THE MAX EMAIL METHOD AS WELL AS SENDING VIRTUAL POST CARDS OR THANK YOU CARDS TO THOSE WHO HAVE DONATED A LOT OF MONEY TO YOU.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00048	WORK WITH YOUR MARKETING TEAM OR WHOEVER MAY BE IN CHARGE OF GRAPHICS ON YOUR TEAM TO CREATE CUTE DESIGNS AND INTERESTING CONCEPTS.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00049	MAYBE THEY TIE INTO YOUR OVERALL BRANDING AS AN ORGANIZATION OR YOUR CAMPAIGN OR IF YOU HAD A THEME FOR YOUR PUSH DAY ANYTHING LIKE THAT IT REALLY HELPS TO ELEVATE THE STEWARDSHIP MATERIALS
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00051	SO ONE OF OUR BIGGEST INITIATIVES AT PDM THIS YEAR FOR STEWARDSHIP WAS OUR STEWARDSHIP SPOTLIGHTS DURING OUR DANCE MARATHON.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00052	ONCE AN HOUR THERE WAS A SLOT OF A FEW MINUTES SET ASIDE FOR PREPARED STEWARDSHIP SHOUTOUTS WHERE WE WOULD GET ON STAGE AND RECOGNIZE AND APPLAUD SOME OF OUR TOP DONORS
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00053	SO THIS CAME IN THE FORM OF THANKING ALL OF THE BUSINESSES THAT DONATED TO OUR ORGANIZATION IN ANY WAY OVER THE PAST YEAR THANKING AND SHOUTING OUT HIGHEST FUNDRAISERS OF THE HOUR DAY YEAR AND SO ON
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00055	SO WE DID THIS TO DEDICATE EXPLICIT TIME DURING ALL OF THE CRAZINESS AND FUN HAPPENING DURING OUR MAIN EVENT TO THANK EVERYBODY WHO MADE A BIG IMPACT ON THE REVEAL AT THE END OF THE DAY.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00057	WE WANTED TO INCORPORATE THESE SPOTLIGHTS AFTER PERFORMERS SO THAT WAY THERE WOULD BE A LARGE CROWD BY THE STAGE SO THAT MORE AND MORE PEOPLE COULD RECOGNIZE OUR DONORS AND THE PEOPLE THAT MADE OUR FUNDRAISING POSSIBLE.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00059	DURING THESE TIMES WE EVEN CALLED UP CERTAIN PEOPLE TO THE STAGE TO APPLAUD AND THANK THEM IF THEY WERE AT OUR EVENT.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00060	AS WELL AS INVITING REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE BUSINESSES THAT HAD DONATED TO US TO COME TO OUR EVENT SO THEY COULD BE RECOGNIZED ON THE STAGE.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00062	SO NOW SWITCHING OVER TO THE SECOND PRONG OF INDIVIDUAL STEWARDSHIP
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00063	SO INDIVIDUAL STEWARDSHIP IS ALWAYS A BIT DIFFICULT WE HAVE FOUND IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY GETTING PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF STAFF MEMBERS TO USE THE RESOURCES THAT ARE PROVIDED.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00064	TAKE TIME AND EFFORT TO PROPERLY STEWARD, RECOGNIZE AND THANK THEIR DONORS. SO WE FOUND THAT CREATING TEMPLATES AND EMAIL DRAFTS AND TEXT EXAMPLES IS GREAT BUT IF NOT MANY PEOPLE ACTUALLY USE THEM IT KIND OF DEFEATS THE POINT.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00065	SO THIS YEAR ONE OF OUR MAIN GOALS IN TERMS OF STEWARDSHIP FOR OUR DANCE MARATHON WAS TO INCREASE PARTICIPANT STEWARDSHIP SO TRY TO GET AS MANY PARTICIPANTS AS POSSIBLE NOT JUST STAFF MEMBERS TO THANK THOSE
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00066	THAT HAD DONATED TO THEM.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00068	AND SUPPORTED THEM IN MEANINGFUL WAYS. THIS INVOLVED NOT ONLY FIGURING OUT HOW TO DISTRIBUTE RESOURCES BUT HOW TO GET PARTICIPANTS TO USE THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAD CREATED AS WELL.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00069	SO THE MAIN IDEA FOR INDIVIDUAL STEWARDSHIP IN TRYING TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL AND THIS EFFORT WAS CREATING AND IMPLEMENTING WHAT WE CALLED A STEWARDSHIP MATRIX.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00070	SO ESSENTIALLY THIS WAS A CHART THAT GAVE A RECOMMENDATION OF WHAT STEWARDING EFFORT OR METHOD THE INDIVIDUAL SHOULD USE TO THANK A DONOR DEPENDENT ON THE AMOUNT THAT THE PERSON DONATED.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00071	SO FOR EXAMPLE IF A PERSON DONATED OVER $100 WE SUGGESTED AND GAVE THE INDIVIDUAL RESOURCES TO SEND THOSE PEOPLE A VIRTUAL THANK YOU CARD.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00072	SO THE THOUGHT BEHIND THIS WAS REALLY THAT IT WAS A CLEAR IF WE GAVE A CLEAR-CUT SIMPLE GUIDELINE AND METHOD FOR PEOPLE TO FOLLOW IT WOULD PROVIDE A BARE MINIMUM IN A SENSE THAT PEOPLE WOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO FOLLOW
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00073	PITTSBURGH PITTSBURGH PITTSBURGH PITTSBURGH PITTSBURGH PITTSBURGH PITTSBURGH PITTSBURGH PITTSBURGH PITTSBURGH PITTSBURGH PITTSBURGH PITTSBURGH PITTSBURGH PITTSBURGH PITTSBURGH PITTSBURGH PITTSBURGH PITTSBURGH PITTSBURGH PITTSBURGH PITTSBURGH PITTSBURGH PITTSBURGH PITTSBURGH PITTSBURGH PITTSBURGH PITTSBURGH PITTSBURGH PITTSBURGH PITTSBURGH PITTSBURGH PITTSBURGH PITTSBURGH PITTSBURGH PITTSBURGH PITTSBURGH PIT
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00074	PITTSBURGH REUPPORT GCLOSERT STORE VISA PITTSBURGH REUPPORT GCLOSERT STORE VISA PITTSBURGH REUPPORT GCLOSERT STORE VISA PITTSBURGH REUPPORT GCLOSERT STORE VISA PITTSBURGH REUPPORT GCLOSERT STORE VISA PITTSBURGH REUPPORT GCLOSERT STORE VISA PITTSBURGH REUPPORT GCLOSERT STORE VISA PITTSBURGH REUPPORT GCLOSERT STORE VISA PITTSBURGH REUPPORT GCLOSERT STORE VISA PITTSBURGH REUPPORT GCLOSERT STORE VISA PITTSBURGH REUPPORT GCLOSERT STORE VISA PITTSBURGH REUPPORT GCLOSERT STORE VISA PITTSBURGH REU
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00075	AND PARTICIPANTS WOULD SEE THE PROVIDED INSTRUCTIONS AND GUIDANCE AND FOLLOW IT.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00077	SO ON NEXT SLIDE IS AN EXAMPLE OF OUR MATRIX THIS WAS OUR MATRIX DURING A FUNDRAISING PUSH DAY THAT WE HAD IN THE SPRING
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00078	THE MATRIX WAS EASILY MODIFIABLE DEPENDING ON THE EVENT OR SITUATION THAT WE WERE USING IT FOR BUT THIS IS AN EXAMPLE FOR THE SPRING PUSH DAY
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00079	SO AS YOU CAN SEE IT GIVES GUIDANCE ON WHAT STEWARDSHIP METHODS TO TAKE DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH A DONOR DONATED TO THEM
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00080	AND ALONG WITH THIS WE HAD ALL OF THE RESOURCES LINKED IN THE MATRIX SO THAT PEOPLE COULD EASILY GO FIND THE EMAIL AND TEXT AND SEND IT RIGHT AWAY.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00081	INSTRUCTIONS FOR VIRTUAL THANK YOU CARDS WITH THE LINK ALL THAT SORT OF THING EVERYTHING EXTREMELY PREPARED
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00082	SO THAT PEOPLE COULD USE THE SIMPLE GUIDELINES AND NOT REQUIRE MUCH EFFORT TO HOPEFULLY INCREASE THEIR PARTICIPATION IN OUR STEWARDSHIP EFFORTS.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00084	IN TERMS OF DISTRIBUTION, LIKE WE MENTIONED, DISTRIBUTING THE INDIVIDUAL STUARDSHIP MATERIALS IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE PLAN AND FOR THIS WE TEAMED UP WITH THE MARKETING AND RECRUITMENT PANELS OF OUR ORGANIZATION.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00085	SO WHOEVER IS IN CHARGE OF THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PARTICIPANTS OR CREATING THE DIFFERENT GRAPHICS AND MATERIALS THAT YOU PUT OUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA, THAT SORT OF THING,
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00086	PART OF THE PLAN.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00087	SO WE HAD OUR RECRUITMENT TEAM SEND OUT THE MATERIALS IN THEIR PARTICIPANT EMAILS WHILE HAVING MARKETING SHARING THE INFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA SO POSTING THE MATERIALS IN ADVANCE OF THE EVENT
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00088	AS WELL AS DURING THE DAY OF SO GIVING CONSTANT AND EASY ACCESS TO EVERYTHING A PERSON COULD NEED FOR THANKING THEIR DONORS
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00089	SO WE HAD MARKETING REPOST EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE USING THE METHODS OUTLINED IN THE MATRIX ON THE INSTAGRAM STORY THROUGHOUT THE DAY, WHICH IS A REMINDER FOR PEOPLE TO THANK THEIR DONORS. AND AGAIN, THE RESOURCES WERE RIGHT THERE ON SOCIAL MEDIA
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00090	OR IN THEIR EMAIL INBOX OR GROUP ME OR WHATEVER METHOD YOU MAY USE.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00091	AND WE JUST KEPT ENCOURAGING THROUGHOUT THE DAY TO REMEMBER TO USE THE PROVIDED MATERIALS THAT WE HAD GIVEN THAT WERE CLEAR CUT RIGHT THERE FOR THEM.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00093	SO IN TERMS OF SUCCESS, THIS WAS BY NO MEANS A 100% SUCCESSFUL EFFORT. THERE WERE STILL PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T NECESSARILY TAKE THE INITIATIVE TO THANK THEIR DONORS EVEN WITH
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00094	TEMPLATES BUT WE DID SEE A VERY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS THAT WERE STEWARDING THEIR DONORS.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00095	USE AND DIDN'T TAKE A LOT OF TIME OR EFFORT ON THEIR PART.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00096	THEY ALSO COMMENTED THAT THEY REALLY APPRECIATED ALL THE STEWARDING MATERIALS BEING FOUND IN ONE LOCATION SO THAT WAY ALL OF IT WAS EASY TO ACCESS EASY TO LOCATE AND EASY TO COME BACK TO TO THANK THEIR DONORS NEXT TIME AS WELL
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00098	IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTING WHAT WE DID THIS YEAR AT PDM INTO OTHER PROGRAMS NOTHING THAT WE DID IN TERMS OF STEWARDSHIP AT PDM THIS YEAR WAS SUPER SPECIFIC TO OUR PROGRAM
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00099	MEANING IT CAN BE REPLICATED UTILIZED ADAPTED IN OTHER DANCE MARATHON PROGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE STEWARDSHIP MATRIX IT CAN BE TAILORED TO WHATEVER YOUR PROGRAM
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00100	NEEDS AND WHATEVER SO LIKE YOU CAN PUT IN YOUR ORGANIZATION'S FAVORITE FORM OF STEWARDSHIP PREVIOUS TEMPLATES THAT YOU'VE CREATED USING AS AN ORGANIZATION TOOL IN THAT WAY
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00101	TAYLOR IT MORE SPECIFICALLY TO YOUR ORGANIZATION THAT WAY. IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF DONORS WHO DONATE HIGH AMOUNTS OF MONEY, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU CAN ALTER THE MATRIX TO REFLECT THIS AND MAKING IT GO TO HIGHER LEVELS VERSUS
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00102	PUSH DAYS WHERE WE HAD A GENERAL 249 PLUS CATEGORY. IF YOU HAVE LOTS OF DONORS WHO DONATE LARGER AMOUNTS OF MONEY YOU CAN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR HIGHER AMOUNTS OF DONATIONS.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00103	IN TERMS OF STEWARDSHIP SPOTLIGHTS THEY ARE ALSO A SUPER EASY BUT EFFECTIVE WAY TO RECOGNIZE THANK AND APPLAUD SOME OF THE HIGHEST DONORS AND THIS CAN BE EASILY DONE DURING ANY OF YOUR DANCE MARATHONS AND YOUR MAIN EVENTS
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00104	SETTING ASIDE A FEW MINUTES TO AN HOUR OR HOWEVER YOUR ORGANIZATION WANTS TO DO IT. IT'S EASY TO SET ASIDE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING TO SET ASIDE A FEW FIVE MINUTE SEGMENTS THROUGHOUT THE DAY.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00105	FOR SOMEONE TO GET UP ON STAGE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE TOP DONORS, IMPORTANT COMPANIES, ALL THAT SORT OF THING.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00107	SO JUST IN GENERAL FOCUSING ON STEWARDSHIP AND ORGANIZATION AND ORGANIZATIONAL STEWARDSHIP WILL HELP TO COVER ALL OF THE BASIS IN THANKING YOUR DONORS BECAUSE IT'S MUCH BETTER FOR THEM TO RECEIVE THANK YOUS FROM INDIVIDUALS
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00108	AND THE ORGANIZATION RATHER THAN RECEIVE A THANK YOU FROM NO ONE JUST AS IT'S BETTER TO THANK THEM AT MULTIPLE POINTS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS COMPARED TO NOT THANKING THEM A SINGLE TIME
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00109	SO THAT WAS KIND OF THE MOTIVATION BEHIND OUR STEWARDSHIP EFFORTS THIS YEAR. AND I THINK THAT YOU CAN TAKE A LOT OF THE DIFFERENT METHODS THAT WE UTILIZED
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00110	AND EASILY ADAPT THEM AND ADJUST THEM TO FIT THE NEEDS OF YOUR PROGRAM AND YOUR PARTICIPANTS AND YOUR DONORS.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00112	JUST TO WRAP IT UP MAKE SURE THAT YOU GOT THE MAIN POINTS OF OUR PRESENTATION AND WHAT WE HAVE DONE AND WHAT YOU COULD IMPLEMENT REMEMBER TO FOCUS ON INDIVIDUAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL STEWARDSHIP
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00113	GET SO CREATIVE AS CREATIVE AS YOU CAN GET AS MANY PEOPLE FROM YOUR ORGANIZATION INVOLVED TO COME UP WITH WAYS TO STEWARD DONORS AND MAKE THEM FEEL AS APPRECIATED AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE REALLY DO APPRECIATE ALL THAT THEY DO.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00114	AND FOCUS ON STEWARDING ALL DONORS NO MATTER HOW MUCH MONEY THEY DONATE WHETHER CANNING AND THEY PUT 25 CENTS IN
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00115	MAKE BASES MAKE SURE THAT ALL DONORS FEEL APPRECIATED BECAUSE EVERYTHING THEY DO MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE FOR OUR ORGANIZATIONS.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00117	Yeah, that is our presentation. If you have any questions at all, please feel free to reach out to us. You can find us at pit underscore PDM on Instagram.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00118	EMMA KAPPLER DANCE CHILDRENS MARATHON HOSPITALS FUTURE CHANGE NETWORK
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00002	SO WHY TWITTER THIS IS A GOOD QUESTION THERE ARE MILLIONS OF TWITTER USERS
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00004	AND A LOT OF TIMES THEY'LL BE DIFFERENT FROM YOUR FACEBOOK FAN BASE SO YOU COULD BE REACHING NEW POTENTIAL PEOPLE.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00005	IT'S KIND OF AN INTERESTING PLATFORM BECAUSE YOU ONLY HAVE 140 CHARACTERS TO TELL YOUR STORY SO YOU HAVE TO BE SHORT, YOU HAVE TO BE BRIEF.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00006	IT'S WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL COME TO SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCES PROVIDE FEEDBACK WHERE THEY'RE LOOKING TO GET CUSTOMER SERVICE
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00007	WE'LL GET QUESTIONS ON TWITTER, I'M HAVING TROUBLE WITH THE VOLUNTEER DEPARTMENT, WHAT CAN I DO? WE CAN GIVE THEM THE E-MAIL ADDRESS TO OUR VOLUNTEERS.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00008	AND TRY TO HELP THEM AS BEST WE CAN.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00010	HOW DOES TWITTER WORK? AS I MENTIONED, IT'S UP TO 40 CHARACTERS PER TWEET. THAT INCLUDES ALL PUNCTUATION AND SPACES.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00011	IF YOU WANT TO INCLUDE A PICTURE IN YOUR TWEET THAT ALSO TAKES UP ROOM.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00012	SHORT AND SWEET IS KIND OF THE END GAME FOR TWITTER.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00014	MESSAGES THAT YOU WRITE WHICH ARE ALSO KNOWN AS TWEETS ARE PUBLIC YOU CAN CREATE A PRIVATE PROFILE IF YOU WANT TO DO THAT PERSONALLY
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00015	I WOULD DEFINITELY NOT RECOMMEND THAT FOR AN ORGANIZATION YOU WOULD WANT TO DO SOMETHING PUBLIC
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00017	AND THE OTHER THING THAT'S COOL ABOUT TWITTER IS IT'S SIMILAR TO FACEBOOK AS IN YOU CAN DO IT ON YOUR COMPUTER, YOU CAN BE ON YOUR PHONE AND CHECK UPDATES.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00018	CAN BE ON YOUR IPAD IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE COOL APPS THAT YOU CAN CHECK FROM ANYTHING
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00020	THESE ARE SOME OF THE TWITTER KEY TERMS. I'M NOT GOING TO READ THROUGH ALL OF THEM. BUT I MAY REFERENCE SOME OF THESE.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00022	THE MAIN THING RETWEET THE RT IS SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD BE INTERESTED IN DOING IS SHARING CONTENT FROM SOMEONE ELSE.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00023	SO APA COULD RETWEET A MESSAGE FROM BEST FRIENDS.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00024	ADOPTING THE PROCESS. MAYBE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAYBE IT'S ONE OF OUR BLOG POSTS THAT'S TALKING ABOUT WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO ADOPT VERSUS
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00025	BUYING TRYING TO THINK WHAT OUR RECENT BLOG POSTS HAVE BEEN. CAN'T THINK OF ANY.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00027	SHARING CONTENT FROM ANOTHER PAGE WHICH IS PRETTY COOL.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00029	AND THEN I MENTIONED HASHTAGS FOR FACEBOOK HASHTAGS ARE VERY POPULAR ON TWITTER SO WHEREVER YOU CAN TRY TO FIT IN THOSE HASHTAGS
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00030	ON TWITTER WE TRY TO USE HASHTAG SAVE THEM ALL A LOT AND WE WILL ALSO MONITOR THAT HASHTAG TO SEE WHO IS USING IT TO SEE IF THERE ARE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE CAN JOIN.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00031	POSITIONS WE CAN RESPOND TO KIND OF KEEP AN EYE ON WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT SAVE THEM ALL BECAUSE THAT'S OUR MOTTO.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00032	YOU CAN ALSO CHECK HASHTAGS LIKE ADOPT OR ADOPT DON'T SHOP.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00033	AND JUST SEE WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT KIND OF ENGAGE WITH THE GENERAL CONVERSATION WHICH IS ALWAYS INTERESTING AND YOU CAN ALWAYS JUMP IN AND RESPOND TO PEOPLE AND ENGAGE THAT WAY.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00035	AND THEN AS I MENTIONED SINCE THERE ARE ONLY 140 CHARACTERS IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO SHORTEN YOUR LINKS
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00036	USERNAMES ITSA LEEAIG USERNAMES ITSA LEEAIG USERNAMES ITSA LEEAIG USERNAMES ITSA LEEAIG USERNAMES ITSA LEEAIG USERNAMES ITSA LEEAIG USERNAMES ITSA LEEAIG USERNAMES ITSA LEEAIG USERNAMES ITSA LEEAIG USERNAMES ITSA LEEAIG USERNAMES ITSA LEEAIG USERNAMES ITSA LEEAIG USERNAMES ITSA LEEAIG USERNAMES ITSA LEEAIG USERNAMES ITSA LEEAIG USERNAMES ITSA LEEAIG USERNAMES ITSA LEEAIG USERNAMES ITSA LEEAIG USERNAMES ITSA LEEAIG USERNAMES ITSA LEEAIG USERNAMES ITSA LEEAIG USERNAMES ITSA LEEAIG USERNAM
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00037	IT'S A FREE TOOL IT'S VERY COOL YOU CAN ALSO CUSTOMIZE YOUR LINKS WE USE BITLY FOR FACEBOOK AS WELL BECAUSE IT TRACKS HOW MANY PEOPLE CLICK THROUGH
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00039	VERY USEFUL
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00041	TWITTER IS RELATIVELY EASY TO SIGN UP FOR YOU JUST FELL OUT A PROFILE AND INCLUDE A PICTURE GENERALLY THAT'S GOING TO BE YOUR ORGANIZATION'S LOGO
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00042	AND THEY HAVE THIS NEW COOL LAYOUT THEY'VE INTRODUCED IN THE PAST YEAR. IT'S ALMOST LIKE A COVER PHOTO. THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT LOOK MORE LIKE FACEBOOK ESSENTIALLY.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00043	BUT WHEN WE GO THROUGH IT YOU CAN SEE THERE'S LIKE A COVER PHOTO AREA AND THEN A
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00045	YOUR TWITTER ICON AS WELL.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00047	TWEETING TIPS SAME THING AS FACEBOOK AS FAR AS CONTENT PEOPLE LIKE LINKS TO INTERESTING STORIES THEY LIKE BLOG POSTS DEALS
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00048	YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE CHEEKINESS ON TWITTER THAN YOU CAN ON FACEBOOK. JUST BE A LITTLE FUNNY. THAT'S KIND OF MORE OF THE PLATFORM AND THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ON IT.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00050	AND A COOL THING THAT HAS BEEN DOING REALLY WELL ON TWITTER IS IF YOU ACTUALLY JUST
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00051	USE TWITTER.COM WE USE HOOT SUITE TO MANAGE OUR TWITTER ACCOUNT BUT IF YOU GO TO TWITTER.COM YOU CAN UPLOAD A PHOTO WITHIN YOUR TWEET
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00052	AND IT MAKES YOUR TWEET MUCH BIGGER ON THE TWITTER NEWS FEED AND IT JUST LOOKS REALLY COOL. IT'S VERY VISUAL. SO IF YOU HAVE A GOOD PHOTO YOU CAN INCLUDE IN A TWEET.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00053	PEOPLE INCLUDE SENSE INTERESTING PEOPLE INCLUDE SENSE INTERESTING PEOPLE INCLUDE SENSE INTERESTING PEOPLE INCLUDE SENSE INTERESTING PEOPLE INCLUDE SENSE INTERESTING PEOPLE INCLUDE SENSE INTERESTING PEOPLE INCLUDE SENSE INTERESTING PEOPLE INCLUDE SENSE INTERESTING PEOPLE INCLUDE SENSE INTERESTING PEOPLE INCLUDE SENSE INTERESTING PEOPLE INCLUDE SENSE INTERESTING PEOPLE INCLUDE SENSE INTERESTING PEOPLE INCLUDE SENSE INTERESTING PEOPLE INCLUDE SENSE INTERESTING PEOPLE INCLUDE SENSE INTERESTING PEOPLE INCLUDE SENSE INTERESTING PEOPLE INCLUDE SENSE INTERESTING PEOPLE INCLUDE SENSE INTERESTING PEOPLE INCLUDE SEN
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00054	AND YOU HAVE TO BE AWARE OF THAT. IF YOU'RE DOING A PHOTO AND A LINK, THEN YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE VERY MANY CHARACTERS TO ACTUALLY
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00056	POSTS AND THEIR FACILITIES.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00058	SO THE QUESTION IS HOW VALUABLE IS TWITTER IN MANAGING LIKE A SMALLER GROUP OF ABOUT A THOUSAND VOLUNTEERS AND I WOULD SAY IT'S NOT VERY VALUABLE.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00059	VALUABLE FOR YOU FOR THE ORGANIZATION OVERALL IT'S NICE TO HAVE A TWITTER PRESENCE IF YOU HAVE THE TIME AND RESOURCES
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00060	MANAGE IT IF YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT TIME AND RESOURCES I WOULD DEFINITELY SAY THAT FACEBOOK IS NUMBER ONE. IT'S NUMBER ONE FOR US. IT CONTINUES TO BE NUMBER ONE FOR
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00061	MOST ANIMAL WELL FOR ORGANIZATIONS INSTAGRAM IS ANOTHER COOL
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00063	USING AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS GROWN IMMENSELY FOR US AS WELL. AND THAT TAKES A LITTLE LESS TIME THAN TWITTER I WOULD SAY. FOR TWITTER TO BE A
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00064	VALUABLE AND SUCCESSFUL FOR YOU THERE HAS TO BE TIME SPENT ON IT.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00065	TIME SPENT FINDING COOL CONTENT AND SHARING IT TIME SPENT RESPONDING TO PEOPLE TIME SPENT TRACKING HASHTAGS AND SEEING WHAT THE CONVERSATIONS ARE
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00066	THERE'S A LOT OF ENGAGEMENT ON TWITTER AND THERE'S A LOT OF ENGAGEMENT ON FACEBOOK AS WELL AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN HELP MAKE YOUR PAGE A SUCCESS BUT FOR TWITTER THAT'S
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00067	THAT'S ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE THINGS YOU DEFINITELY CAN'T JUST TALK AT PEOPLE YOU TALK TO PEOPLE AND THAT'S WHAT THE TWITTER AUDIENCE EXPECTS IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE PRESENT ON TWITTER.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00069	BEST PRACTICES RELATIONSHIP BUILDING IS KEY LISTEN FOR COMMENTS ABOUT YOU RESPOND TO COMMENTS AND QUERIES YOU CAN ALSO DO A SEARCH
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00070	NOT ONLY CAN YOU SEE PEOPLE WHO ARE TWEETING DIRECTLY TO YOU OR MENTIONING YOU BUT YOU CAN DO A SEARCH FOR YOUR ORGANIZATION
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00071	AND SEE WHERE ELSE YOU'RE MENTIONED WHERE PEOPLE MIGHT NOT EVEN REALIZE THAT YOU'RE ACTIVE ON TWITTER.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00072	QUESTIONS ON TWITTER THAT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE THERE'S LIKE A TRENDING
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00073	PICTURES
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00074	PEOPLE WITH A DOG GIVING A KISS TO ONE OF OUR CAREGIVERS AND THEN JUST ASKED, YOU KNOW, IT'S NATIONAL LOVE YOUR PET DAY WITH THE HASHTAG. HOW ARE YOU CELEBRATING OR SHOW US HOW YOU'RE CELEBRATING.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00075	SO TWITTER IS A GREAT WAY TO BUILD ENGAGEMENT LIKE THAT WHERE IT'S JUST GENERAL QUESTIONS YOU CAN ASK YOUR AUDIENCE AND GET THEM TO RESPOND TO YOU.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00076	ENGAGE WITH YOU AND KIND OF BUILD YOUR BRAND THAT WAY.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00078	WE CAN ALSO RETWEET MESSAGES YOU WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WHICH I MENTIONED AND I CAN SHOW YOU HOW TO DO THAT WHEN WE GET TO THE LIVE DRIVE.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00080	AND THE OTHER THING ABOUT TWITTER IS THAT IT'S VERY REALTIME PEOPLE WILL RESPOND QUICKLY AND THEY WILL EXPECT YOU TO RESPOND QUICKLY
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00081	24 HOURS OR LESS IS KIND OF OUR GO TO ON TWITTER.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00082	WE TRY TO BE VERY QUICK PRETTY MUCH TRY TO RESPOND TO ANYONE WHO TWEETS US WITHIN AN HOUR ON WEEKDAYS DURING BUSINESS HOURS.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00083	AFTER HOURS ARE ONE THING AND WEEKENDS ARE ANOTHER THING AND WE DO MONITOR AND RESPOND ON WEEKENDS AS WELL.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00084	BUT THERE IS DEFINITELY AN EXPECTATION THAT IF YOU ARE ACTIVE ON TWITTER THEN YOU SHOULD BE ACTIVE AND YOU SHOULD BE RESPONSIVE.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00086	OK QUESTIONS YES THE QUESTION IS WHY IS AN AVERAGE PERSON ON TWITTER THE ANSWER IS BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THEMSELVES
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00088	I'M YES ASKED THEM YOU KNOW TWITTER IS A MICROBLOG ESSENTIALLY
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00089	SO GIVES YOU A HUNDRED AND FOURTY CHARACTERS TO SAY WHAT YOU ATE FOR BREAKFAST OR SAY THAT YOU JUST WORKED OUT. OH PEOPLE LOVE TO SHARE THEIR WORKOUTS.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00091	I'M CROSSFITTERS ESPECIALLY LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THEIR WORKOUT
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00092	THEY LIKE TO SHARE PHOTOS AGAIN YOU KNOW SAME THING WITH INSTAGRAM IT'S JUST SHARING PHOTOS PEOPLE LIKE TO SHARE
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00094	WHAT THEY WANT ABOUT THEIR LIVES WITH OTHERS AND THEY WANT TO GET FEEDBACK AND THEY WANT TO FEEL VALIDATION. SO YEAH.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00096	YEAH SO A QUESTION IS WOULD TWITTER BE A VALUABLE RECRUITING TOOL
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00097	IF YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND VOLUNTEERS I WOULD SAY IT DEFINITELY COULD BE IF YOU CAN TAKE THE TIME TO MONITOR CONVERSATIONS AND INSERT YOURSELF
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00098	AND THEN WHEREVER YOU CAN YOU KNOW RESPOND TO PEOPLE THAT ARE IN YOUR AREA TALKING ABOUT WORKING OUT YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE A COOL PROGRAM LIKE THE JOGGER DOG PROGRAM HERE IN AUSTIN IS AWESOME
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00099	PROGRAM LIKE THAT AND YOU HAVE A PRESENCE ON TWITTER AND YOU CAN REACH OUT TO PEOPLE YOU CAN ABSOLUTELY USE IT THAT WAY.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00101	PEOPLE PEOPLE REALLY LIKE
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00102	ACTIVITY CONSTANT FEEDBACK PEOPLE LOOK FOR ON TWITTER IS THAT IMMEDIATE GRATIFICATION RESPONSE RIGHT THERE.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00104	YEAH THE QUESTION IS WHEN WE LAUNCH OUR INSTAGRAM DID WE SEE A DECREASE ON TWITTER LIKE WAS THERE ANY CANNIBAL ISM AND I WOULD SAY THERE ISN'T INSTAGRAM OVERALL HAS A VERY YOUNG AUDIENCE
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00106	PRACTICES QUICK ASK LEVERAGE NATURE
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00108	CONTENT MORE BEHIND THE SCENES FUNNY PHOTOS WITH FUNNY CAPTIONS
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00109	ALLOWS FOR A LITTLE BIT MORE CREATIVITY AND JUST BECAUSE IT'S THE NATURE OF THAT CHANNEL AND THEN YOU CAN ALSO AGAIN UTILIZE HASHTAGS ON INSTAGRAM TO GET YOUR PHOTOS SEEN BY MORE PEOPLE.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00111	NO, WE DIDN'T SEE ANY DROP. YEAH, OUR TWITTER CONTINUES TO GROW.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00113	AND WE DON'T REALLY DO ADVERTISING ON TWITTER WE'VE DONE IT A COUPLE TIMES BUT I CAN'T THINK OF YOU KNOW MORE THAN A HANDFUL OF TIMES THAT WE'VE
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00115	PAYING ADVERTISING ON TWITTER. I'M GOING TO ACTUALLY PULL UP THE TWITTER
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00117	THIS IS OUR BEST FRIENDS TWITTER ACCOUNT.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00119	SO THIS IS THAT COVER PHOTO THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT THIS IS THE ICON
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00121	SPROUT SOCIAL HAS A VERY COOL RESOURCE. IT'S A GUIDELINE FOR SOCIAL MEDIA IMAGE SIZES. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND CHECKING IT OUT. IT TELLS YOU THE SIZES NEEDED.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00122	FOR IMAGES ON FACEBOOK LIKE THE IDEAL IMAGE SIZE TO POST ON FACEBOOK IS LIKE 1200 BY A THOUSAND PIXELS SPROUT SOCIAL
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00123	IT'S A SOCIAL MEDIA IMAGE GUIDELINE AND IF YOU GOOGLE IT, IT WILL COME UP AND IT'S ACTUALLY IN A GOOGLE SPREADSHEET.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00124	SO IT'S CONSTANTLY UPDATED BUT IT TELLS YOU EXACTLY WHAT IMAGE SIZES YOU NEED WHICH IS REALLY GREAT IT TELLS YOU YOU KNOW YOUR FACEBOOK COVER PHOTO FACEBOOK EVENTS
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00125	UM FACEBOOK TIMELINE FACEBOOK ADVERTISING TWITTER INSTAGRAM INSTAGRAM IS LIKE 2048 BY 2048
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00126	I THINK. BUT TWITTER, THE IDEAL SIZE IS LONGER. IT'S LIKE 800 BY 400 OR SOMETHING.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00127	IISP EO THOWS RECCAL FRIED LYYA666B99 LONG
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00129	SHOW OFF THE BEST.

YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00135	IS THERE ARE TWEETS
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00136	YOU CAN ON TWITTER PIN TO THE TOP OF YOUR PROFILE PAGE THE SAME WAY THAT YOU CAN ON YOUR FACEBOOK PAGE
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00137	THAT'S A NEWER FEATURE THAT THEY ROLLED OUT WHEN THEY DID THIS KIND OF NEW LAYOUT AGAIN YOU KNOW TWITTER TRYING TO BE MORE LIKE FACEBOOK
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00139	YOU CAN SEE SO LIKE THIS TWEET HERE HAD 20 RETWEETS THAT'S WHAT THIS LITTLE THESE LITTLE ARROWS ARE AND THIS FAVORITE HERE AND 14 FAVORITE
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00141	FB LA SUT MME1 ENJOY CENTERS WEEKS OONT 1GCSH50
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00143	THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE RETWEETED.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00145	THIS IS THE NATIONAL LOVE YOUR PET DAY AND THIS DID REALLY WELL. 129 PEOPLE FAVORED IT, WHICH FOR TWITTER IS KIND OF A LOT FOR US.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00147	AND YOU CAN SEE I SHOWED YOU THIS POST ON OUR FACEBOOK PAGE AS WELL AND THE IMAGES ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SIZES SO THIS IS OPTIMIZED FOR TWITTER VERSUS THE ONE THAT WAS OPTIMIZED FOR FACEBOOK
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00149	AS YOU CAN SEE,
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00151	ON THE FEED IT SHOWS UP AND LOOKS REALLY NICE SO YOU KNOW THIS IS A LOT MORE LIKELY TO CATCH YOUR EYE THAN JUST THIS
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00153	SO WE TRY TO DO THAT WHENEVER WE CAN.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00155	YOU CAN ALSO SEE WHO YOU'RE FOLLOWING FOLLOWERS ONE THING COOL ABOUT FOLLOWERS IS IT SHOWS YOU VERIFIED FOLLOWERS AS WELL AND VERIFIED
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00156	ACCOUNTS ARE NORMALLY EITHER ORGANIZATIONS OR CELEBRITIES OR BRANDS WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FOLLOWERS.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00157	E-ONLINE
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00159	SO THIS IS OUR HOME.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00161	PAYCHE FOR TWITTER
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00163	SO THIS IS THE TIMELINE OF
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00165	THESE ARE ALL PEOPLE THAT WE FOLLOW RIGHT HERE SO THAT'S WHAT'S SHOWING UP IN OUR FEED
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00167	AS YOU CAN SEE
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00169	PEOPLE ARE SUPER SUPER ACTIVE ON TWITTER THERE'S A LOT TO KEEP UP WITH YOU COULD DEFINITELY POST A LOT MORE OFTEN ON TWITTER THAN YOU CAN ON FACEBOOK JUST BECAUSE THE LIFE SPAN OF A TWEET
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00170	IS MUCH MUCH SHORTER THAN THE LIFE SPAN OF A FACEBOOK POST SO YOU HAVE A LOT MORE LEE WAY TO POST
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00171	I MEAN WE TRY TO GET OUT 5 TO 7 TWEETS A DAY VERSUS 2 FACEBOOK POSTS A DAY
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00172	And that doesn't include the tweets that we have responding to people and monitoring hashtags.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00174	NG YOU CAN SET THAT UP. I WOULD NOT ADVISE SETTING THAT UP.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00176	Oh, hello.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00178	WONDERFUL LIVE TWEETING EXAMPLE. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND LINKING YOUR FACEBOOK TO YOUR TWITTER BECAUSE THEY'RE SUCH DIFFERENT PLATFORMS.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00179	EWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUW
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00180	CREFTED FOR TWITTER. CREFTED FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE WHOLE THING AT ONCE.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00182	SO THIS IS VERY COOL. THIS SHOWS ALL THE RETWEETS, PEOPLE THAT FOLLOW US, MENTIONS,
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00184	DEALING WITH TROLLS
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00186	ANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00188	WHICH IS VERY COOL.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00190	AND SO I'M SURE YOU'RE FOLLOWING THE HASHTAG AND THEN RESPONDING TO THESE PEOPLE. SO GREAT WAY TO ENGAGE EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY TAGGING AMERICAN PETS ALIVE ON TWITTER THEY'RE USING THE HASHTAG.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00191	WEEKEND STILL RESPOND WITH THEM AND KIND OF CREATE A CONVERSATION AND LET THEM KNOW YOU'RE PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT THEY'RE SAYING.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00193	THE OTHER THING THAT'S COOL ABOUT USING THIS, YOU CAN DO VERIFIED USERS. SO AGAIN, THOSE ARE LIKE THE MORE
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00002	SO NEXT UP WE HAVE DR. WEN ZONG ZHAO. HE LEADS THE HARVARD ME-CFS COLLABORATION WITH DR. RON TOMPKINS.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00003	He's an associate professor in surgery and bioinformatics at Harvard Medical School and MGH.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00004	He's a member of the Scientific Advisory Board at OMF. He directs the MGH Inflammation and Metabolism Computational Center, and he also leads the Computational Genomics Group at Stanford.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00005	as well so he's a very busy man. He's going to talk about the open data sharing platform. Thank you very much Wenzong.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00007	THANK YOU, EVERYONE, FOR COMING. WE'RE A LITTLE BIT SHORT OF TIME, SO I'LL TRY TO GO THROUGH THE SLIDES QUICKLY AND WE CAN END BY 345 TO BE ON SCHEDULE.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00009	FOR THE NEXT 10 TO 15 MINUTES I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT WHAT DATA AVAILABLE ON THE WEBSITE OF OPEN MEDICINE FOUNDATION AND WHAT WE ARE
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00010	WORKING WITH COLLABORATORS AND PRACTICALLY EVERYONE IN THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY TO LOOK AT THIS DATA AND WHAT HAS BEEN DONE AND WHAT'S IN THE WORKS.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00011	SO AS WE HAVE HEARD QUITE A FEW TALKS THIS AFTERNOON ABOUT THE SCIENCE BEHIND CFS AND WE KNOW THAT AS A COMPLEX DISEASE
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00012	THERE ARE MANY POTENTIAL REASONS AS CAUSES OF MECFS FROM GENES TO INFECTIONS TO THE ENVIRONMENT.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00014	FIND THE POTENTIAL CAUSES OF CFS AND PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY FIND THE TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS. WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00015	MECFS COLLABORATION 2019 FINDING KNOWN HARVARD PUBLIC JUNE WORD MECFS COLLABORATION 2019 FINDING KNOWN HARVARD PUBLIC JUNE WORD MECFS COLLABORATION 2019 FINDING KNOWN HARVARD PUBLIC JUNE WORD MECFS COLLABORATION 2019 FINDING KNOWN HARVARD PUBLIC JUNE WORD MECFS COLLABORATION 2019 FINDING KNOWN HARVARD PUBLIC JUNE WORD MECFS COLLABORATION 2019 FINDING KNOWN HARVARD PUBLIC JUNE WORD MECFS COLLABORATION 2019 FINDING KNOWN HARVARD PUBLIC JUNE WORD MECFS COLLABORATION 2019 FINDING KNOWN HARVARD PUBLIC JUNE WORD MECFS COLLABORATION 2019 FINDING KNOWN HARVARD PUBLIC JUNE WORD MECFS COLLABORATION
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00016	UNFORTUNATELY MOST OF THE STUDIES TODAY ONLY CAN LOOK AT ONE OR TWO ASPECTS OF ALL THE THINGS AMONG ALL THE THINGS AND ON A SMALL
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00017	GROUP OF PATIENTS. THEREFORE THE FINDINGS FROM EACH INDIVIDUAL STUDIES NEED TO BE COMPARED SO YOU CAN FIND A RIGOROUS SIGNAL.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00018	AND DATA COLLECTED FROM DIFFERENT LEVELS, FOR EXAMPLE, MEASURING GENES VERSUS MEASURING INFECTIONS NEED TO BE INTEGRATED
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00019	SO WE CAN FIND SOMETHING CALLED A CHAIN OF EVIDENCE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD US TO THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE. SO WE HAVE HEARD ENOUGH OF THIS AND BECAUSE OF THIS,
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00021	EARLY ON OPEN MEDICINE FOUNDATION UNDER LEADERSHIP OF DR. RON DAVIS ADOPTED THIS POLICY OF OPEN DATA
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00023	WHICH MEANS THAT AS SOON AS PRETTY MUCH AS SOON AS A EXPERIMENT IS DONE WE TRY TO PUT DATA ON THE INTERNET
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00024	AND SHARE WITH RESEARCHERS IN THE COMMUNITY BASICALLY ALL OVER THE WORLD.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00025	AND WHOEVER REGISTERED ON THIS WEBSITE CAN SEE THE RAW DATA AND THE TYPE OF FINDINGS THAT HAVE BEEN
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00027	BY OUR OWN TEAM AND OFTEN THEY WOULD TELL US WHAT ARE THE FINDINGS THAT WE PERHAPS ARE MISSING OR THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION OF THE RESULTS.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00028	SO I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF THE TIME I WOULD ONLY BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU SORT OF A COUPLE OF GLIMPSE OF WHAT'S ON THE WEBSITE
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00030	SO THIS IS THE SORT OF THE FRONT END OF THE WEBSITE. IT'S MECFS.STANFORD.EDU. AT THE MOMENT WE'LL HAVE ANOTHER MIRROR SITE ON THE HARVARD DOMAIN SOON.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00031	CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHENG CHEN
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00032	CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00033	SO THE DATA ARE SEPARATED INTO DIFFERENT LEVELS AND THEN WE WOULD COMPARE THE PATIENTS AS A GROUP WITH THE CONTROLS AND THAT RESULTS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE ON THE WEBSITE FOR PEOPLE TO STUDY.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00034	AND PERHAPS MORE INTERESTINGLY WE WOULD LIKE TO INTEGRATE DATA FROM DIFFERENT LEVELS TOGETHER
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00035	CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00036	AND WHETHER THE FUNCTION OF THAT PROTEIN IS INDEED IMPAIRED IN THE PATIENT.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00037	SO JUST AS AN EXAMPLE OBVIOUSLY THIS TAKES A LOT OF PEOPLE'S WORK AND THAT'S A LIST OF
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00038	CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG CHANG
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00040	HAN LIY HARVARD ESTEBAN DAVID RICHARDS KAUSHAL HUNG IP MCGREGOR DAWEI JUNE YUAN
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00041	SO YOU CAN CHOOSE WHAT YOU WANT TO SEE AND THIS SHOWS THE RESULTS. THIS HAPPENED TO BE A CYTOKINE DATA OF ONE PARTICULAR PATIENT
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00042	AND HE OR SHE HAD TWO ABNORMAL TESTS IN TERMS OF THEIR IN TERMS OF THE PATIENTS CYTOCAN LEVELS SO THESE ARE THE PATIENT GROUPS THESE ARE THE CONTROL GROUPS
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00043	AND THIS TRIANGLE INDICATES THE LEVEL OF THE PATIENT. SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS PARTICULAR PATIENT HAS MUCH LOWER
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00044	LEVEL OF CYTOCINE WHICH IS CALLED BRAIN DERIVED NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF NEUROLOGICAL DISEASES AS A BIOMATERACTORY FOR SOME OF THOSE DISEASES.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00045	SO THIS PATIENT HAS REALLY LOW LEVEL NOT ONLY COMPARING TO THE
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00046	INDIVIDUAL WORD INCREASE IN THE CASE OF C.D.40L INDICATIONS IN THE CASE OF C.D.40L INDICATIONS IN THE CASE OF C.D.40L INDICATIONS IN THE CASE OF C.D.40L INDICATIONS IN THE CASE OF C.D.40L INDICATIONS IN THE CASE OF C.D.40L INDICATIONS IN THE CASE OF C.D.40L INDICATIONS IN THE CASE OF C.D.40L INDICATIONS IN THE CASE OF C.D.40L INDICATIONS IN THE CASE OF C.D.40L INDICATIONS IN THE CASE OF C.D.40L INDICATIONS IN THE CASE OF C.D.40L INDICATIONS IN THE CASE OF C.D.40L INDICATIONS IN THE CASE OF
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00047	TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00048	T-CELL FUNCTIONS FOR EXAMPLE. HERE YOU SEE BETWEEN PATIENT GROUPS AND CONTROL GROUP THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE. HOWEVER THE LEVEL OF THIS
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00049	FOR THIS PARTICULAR CYTOCORN IS MUCH LOWER SO I HOPE THAT WHILE WE GROW ENOUGH NUMBER OF THIS KIND OF OBSERVATIONS PEOPLE CAN START TO LINK THINGS TOGETHER
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00051	AND THIS IS JUST OUR CURRENT ATTEMPT OF DOING SO.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00053	SO EACH ROW HERE IS ONE PHENOTYPE, FOR EXAMPLE, SLEEP PROBLEMS, COGNITIVE TEST PROBLEMS, PAIN, FATIGUE, ET CETERA. OBVIOUSLY WE MEASURE A LOT OF THOSE.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00054	AND EACH ROW HERE IS THE CORRELATION OF ONE OF THE ANALYTES AT DIFFERENT LEVELS
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00055	THAT'S SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH ANY OF THESE SYMPTOMS OF PATIENTS. SO THE REDISH COLOR SHOWS POSITIVE CORRELATION FOR EXAMPLE CORTISOL LEVEL.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00056	RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE BLUISH COLOR SHOWS NEGATIVE CORRELATION AND AS WE HEARD FROM THE CLINICIANS EARLY ON, SINCE THERE'S A RATHER LARGE HETEROGENEITY AMONG DIFFERENT
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00057	THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE WANT TO DO THIS TYPE OF ANALYSIS TO SEE WHAT ARE THE INDICATORS THAT WOULD BE MOST CORRELATED WITH A PARTICULAR TYPE OF SYMPTOM OF THE PATIENTS.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00059	SO THIS IS THE GROUPS OF PHYSICAL FUNCTIONS, COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS AND SLEEP PROBLEMS.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00061	SO THESE ARE OUR GENE RESULTS AS RON ALREADY MENTIONED. WE TRY TO SEQUENCE THE WHOLE GENOME OF PATIENTS AS MUCH AS WE CAN.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00062	AND ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF THAT, RON ALDA MENTIONED, ONE OF THE FINDINGS
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00063	THE OTHER WAY OF LOOKING AT THE DATA WOULD BE THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY FIND THOSE RARE PATHOGENIC VARIANTS IN EACH PATIENT. REALISTICALLY, FOR MOST OF US, WE HAVE, YOU KNOW,
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00064	PARTICULARLY PATHOGENIC VARIANTS ONE OR THE OTHER. THE QUESTION MORE IS THAT WHETHER THOSE VARIANTS CONTRIBUTE OR POTENTIALLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE DISEASE. SO JUST AS AN EXAMPLE, HERE'S
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00066	CSTIC FIBROSIS
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00068	GENES AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE ARE TWO HETOXYGUS VARIANTS THERE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THIS IS ONE OF THOSE VARIANTS THAT'S COMMON IN THE COCASIAN POPULATION.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00069	RECOMMENDATIONS. MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE SEE ACTUALLY A LOT OF THESE VARIANTS THAT ARE KNOWN TO BE INVOLVED IN
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00070	POTENTIALLY NEUROLOGICAL DISEASES. SO BECAUSE OF TIME, I'LL JUST SHOW YOU A ROUGH COMPARISON. SO WHAT THIS IS, IS TO ASK THE QUESTION,
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00071	PARTICULARLY IN THE PAST. IF YOU LOOK AT THE PATHWAYS OF THOSE VARIANTS I SHOWED YOU IN THE PREVIOUS SLIDE AND ASK
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00073	WHAT HAVE BEEN DONE ON THESE VARIANTS IN THE STUDY OF OTHER DISEASES, FOR EXAMPLE, IN PAIN, IN SLEEP DISTURBANCE, IN COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT, AND TO OUR
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00074	AS YOU CAN SEE HERE, MORE THAN 50% OF THE VARIANTS THAT I SHOWED YOU ARE ACTUALLY KNOWN TO BE INVOLVED IN ALL THOSE SYMPTOMS.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00075	SO SINCE WE ONLY LOOK AT FEW PATIENTS AS RANG MENTIONED THESE WERE SEVERELY ILL PATIENTS IN THIS PARTICULAR STUDY WE THOUGHT THAT WE SHOULD
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00076	TEST ACCIDENTAL FINDINGS UKBIOBANK DATA THERE THEY HAVE SOMEWHERE AROUND 2,000, 3,000
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00077	CENTER FOR CERTIFICATE CERTIFICATE CERTIFICATE CERTIFICATE CERTIFICATE CERTIFICATE CERTIFICATE CERTIFICATE CERTIFICATE CERTIFICATE CERTIFICATE CERTIFICATE CERTIFICATE CERTIFICATE CERTIFICATE CERTIFICATE CERTIFICATE CERTIFICATE CERTIFICATE CERTIFICATE CERTIFICATE CERTIFICATE CERTIFICATE CERTIFICATE CERTIFICATE CERTIFICATE CERTIFICATE CERTIFICATE CERTIFICATE CERTIFICATE CERTIFICATE CERTIFICATE CERTIFICATE CERTIFICATE CERTIFICATE CERTIFICATE CERTIF
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00079	WE WOULD GET A WEAKER BUT STILL SIGNIFICANT SIGNAL THERE. SO THIS JUST GIVE YOU SOME CLUE OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00080	AND TRYING TO SEE WHETHER WE CAN USE THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00081	TO IDENTIFY THE POTENTIAL COST OF THE DISEASE AS WELL AS TRYING TO BORROW STRENGTH
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00082	TREATMENT FROM STUDIES OF OTHER DISEASES THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL FOR TREATING ME CFS PATIENTS ONE DAY. NOW BECAUSE OF THE TIME,
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00084	I'LL PROBABLY JUST STOP HERE.
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00002	Good morning everyone. Good morning. I'm going to move away from here. It's absolutely lovely to see you all this morning. And I thought what I would do is just say a few words of welcome and thank you.
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00003	I want to especially start off by thanking Scandit who are our drink sponsors last night.

YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00018	COME ON, WHERE ARE THE HANDS? THERE THEY ARE, ALL RIGHT. IN THE ROME... WHO'S BEEN IN AN AISLE IN THE GROCERY STORE?
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00019	I IN YOUR DRUG FOOD WONDERING SHOULD I OR SHOULDN'T I RIGHT AND WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT ROMANCE THAT LONGING THAT LOST RENDEZ-VOUS HAVE YOU EVER EATEN FOOD AND HITTING THEM IN THE TRASH
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00020	OR JUST IT'S LIKE A LUSTFUL THING RIGHT AND THE GUILT THAT FOLLOWS THE DRUG RIGHT HOW LONG DOES THE PLEASURE REALLY LAST
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00021	ROMANCE FOOD TRIGGER SUGARX 2ALL RESERVED RIGHT 12222
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00023	WHAT WE CAN DO IS WE CAN USE THESE THINGS TO IDENTIFY THE THINGS THAT ARE DANGEROUS FOR US SO IF SHOULD I EAT IT SHOULD I NOT EAT IT THAT DEADLY QUESTION RIGHT SO I HATE TO BREAK IT TO YOU THE ANSWER IS NO
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00025	YOU SHOULDN'T EAT IT, RIGHT? AND THE ROMANCE, THE PLANNING. I WENT TO NASHVILLE LIKE FIVE YEARS AGO AND EVERY SINGLE ITEM ON MY ITINERARY WAS ABOUT FOOD.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00026	EVERY PLACE I WENT WAS ABOUT FOOD BECAUSE I'M AN ADDICT THAT'S WHAT I DO SO IT BECOMES THIS INGRAINED IN HOW WE THINK AND HOW WE LIVE IN THE GUILT
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00027	DOES IT MAKE YOU FEEL ASHAMED DOES IT MAKE YOU FEEL WORTHLESS OR LIKE A FAILURE IF IT DOES IT'S A DRUG
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00028	SO BASICALLY DEBATE IS PLAYING WITH MATCHES ROMANCE IS SEEING HOW CLOSE YOU CAN GET TO THE FLAMES AND GUILT IS GETTING BURNED WHO'S BEEN BURNED BEFORE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00029	ITS ALWAYS GONNA BURN YOU FOLKS ITS ALWAYS GONNA BE WE FORGET THOUGH WE FORGET AND THATS WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT TO GO THROUGH
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00030	SO JUST HERE REALLY QUICK DEBATE ASKING YOURSELF SHOULD I SHOULDN'T I ROMANCE THE PLANNING IN ADVANCE THE RENDEZ-VOUS
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00032	AND GUILT THAT WORTHLESS SENSE OF FAILURE AFTER WE'VE DONE IT SO THAT'S THE FIRST TOOL THAT'S THE TRIGGER FREE TRIANGLE OKAY
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00034	THE THREE P'S AND THIS IS A THIS GOES DOWN TO MY MOM AND OUR NOW MY MY GRANDMOTHER WAS DYING SHE WAS ON HER DEATH BED SHE WAS ON PALATE OF CARE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00036	I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND MY MOM'S GETTING READY TO GO SO WE CAN WATCH HER PASS.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00038	AND SHE GETS A COOLER
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00040	COUPLE ICE PACKS SHARTS WEIGHING AND MEASURING YOUR VEGETABLES IN OUR MEATS LIKE WHAT ARE YOU DOING
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00042	SHE SAYS I'M PROTECTING MY RECOVERY.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00044	WOW THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES GUYS SO WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS IT GOING TO BE FOR YOU TO PROTECT YOUR RECOVERY YOU DON'T NEED TO PROTECT MY RECOVERY I DO YOU NEED TO PRACTICE YOUR RECOVERY SO COMES WITH THE PLANNING
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00045	PREPARE 12222 PROTECT RESOURCES RIGHT GLOBAL IH PREPARE 12222 PROTECT RESOURCES RIGHT GLOBAL IH PREPARE 12222 PROTECT RESOURCES RIGHT GLOBAL IH PREPARE 12222 PROTECT RESOURCES RIGHT GLOBAL IH PREPARE 12222 PROTECT RESOURCES RIGHT GLOBAL IH PREPARE 12222 PROTECT RESOURCES RIGHT GLOBAL IH PREPARE 12222 PROTECT RESOURCES RIGHT GLOBAL IH PREPARE 12222 PROTECT RESOURCES RIGHT GLOBAL IH PREPARE 12222 PROTECT RESOURCES RIGHT GLOBAL IH PREPARE 12222 PROTECT RESOURCES RIGHT GLOBAL IH PREPARE 12222 PROTECT RESOURCES RIGHT GLOBAL IH PREPARE 12
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00046	IF YOU DON'T DO THE STEPS THAT YOU NEED TO DO TO GET TO WHERE YOU WANT TO BE YOU CAN'T GET THERE IT'S THAT SIMPLE YOU DON'T GO ON A ROAD TRIP WITHOUT PUTTING GAS IN YOUR CAR DO YOU
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00047	IT'S THE SAME THING. YOU'RE GOING TO GET AN OIL CHANGE. YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE YOUR WIPERS ARE CLEAR. RIGHT? YOU'RE GOING TO GET READY FOR YOUR TRIP AND YOU'RE GOING TO PREPARE.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00048	YOU'RE GONNA PACK UP YOUR CAR YOU'RE GONNA PUT IN YOUR SUITCASE YOU'RE GONNA REMEMBER YOUR TOILETRY YOU'RE GONNA DO ALL THESE THINGS AND THAT'S GONNA PROTECT YOUR EXPERIENCE ON YOUR TRIP IT'S GONNA MAKE SURE THAT WHEN YOU GET THERE YOU HAVE WHAT YOU NEED TO DO WHAT YOU WANNA DO
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00049	WHICH IS HOPEFULLY TO HAVE A GOOD TIME SO
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00051	So to prepare is to make ready or able to deal with or do something, right? It's the steps that we need to take to make sure that it becomes possible for us to engage in the activities that will ensure that we protect your recovery.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00053	PLANNING IS VERY IMPORTANT. YOU CAN'T PREPARE WITHOUT A PLAN. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE HEARD JORDAN PETERSON TALK ABOUT THE STUPID PLAN. WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF THIS STUFF IN THE VILLAGE THAT I RUN.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00054	A STUPID PLAN IS YOU FIGURE OUT WHERE YOU WANT TO GO AND THEN YOU SIT FOR FIVE MINUTES AND YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE THE STEPS THAT YOU NEED TO DO TO GET THERE. YOU DON'T NEED TO BE RIGHT.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00055	12222 ARRANGE GLOBAL RESERVED 12222 ARRANGE GLOBAL RESERVED 12222 ARRANGE GLOBAL RESERVED 12222 ARRANGE GLOBAL RESERVED 12222 ARRANGE GLOBAL RESERVED 12222 ARRANGE GLOBAL RESERVED 12222 ARRANGE GLOBAL RESERVED 12222 ARRANGE GLOBAL RESERVED 12222 ARRANGE GLOBAL RESERVED 12222 ARRANGE GLOBAL RESERVED 12222 ARRANGE GLOBAL RESERVED 12222 ARRANGE GLOBAL RESERVED 12222 ARRANGE GLOBAL RESERVED 12222 ARRANGE GLOBAL RESERVED 12222 ARRANGE GLOBAL RESERV
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00057	AND THAT GOES TO THE PREPARATION, WHICH WE JUST TALKED ABOUT. SORRY, I GOT TOO EXCITED. AND THEN THAT ENABLES YOU TO PROTECT YOUR RECOVERY. ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON BUILDING UP UNTIL NOW.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00058	THAT IS THE POINT.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00060	OKAY NOW SO WE KNOW ABOUT THE TRIANGLE WE KNOW ABOUT THE THREE PIECE THE THREE SEAS ARE REALLY IS KIND OF OUR TAKE ON A SORT OF A CBT BASED
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00061	3D TESTING
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00063	BECAUSE USUALLY AS ADDICTS IF YOU'RE ANYTHING LIKE ME WELL YOU HAD A CUE AND THEN YOU ATE YOUR DRUG
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00064	AND THEN YOU HAD A RESULT AS A RESULT OF EATING THE DRUG WHICH USUALLY STUNK RIGHT IT WASN'T WHERE YOU WANTED TO BE SO BY BREAKING IT DOWN THIS WAY WE CAN SEE THAT THE CUE IS A STIMULUS THAT TESTS OFF THE EVENT
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00065	THE CUSTOM IS WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU'RE TRIGGERED, RIGHT? AND THE CONSEQUENCE IS THE RESULT OF WHAT HAPPENS AFTER YOU'VE DONE THE BEHAVIOR OR ACTION OR THE SUBSTANCE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00066	THAT'S YOUR CUE RIGHT SO A CUE COULD BE ANYTHING BUT I'M BELIEVING OR NOT I WAS TRAINED AS AN ARTISAN BREADBAKER NOT SO HELPFUL AS AN ADDICT BUT THE THE POINT IS THAT MY WIFE IS IN THE KITCHEN AND SHE WAS LIKE SHLEPPING BUTTER ACROSS TOAST
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00067	I WORK RIGHT NEXT TO THE KITCHEN AND I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M TRIGGERED I'M LIKE TRYING TO WORK I'M LIKE HELPING ADDICTS AND LIKE HERE LIKE

YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00069	WHAT ARE OUR CUES RIGHT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE PERSONAL TO US
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00071	AND SO WE HAVE TO BE GRATEFUL FOR OUR TRIGGERS
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00073	BOTTOM LINE THEY GIVE US INFORMATION BITTEN TALKED ABOUT THAT WHAT IS THE RELAXED IN YOU IT GIVES YOU INFORMATION THEN YOU CAN BECOME RESPONSIBLE TO DO SOMETHING BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00074	RIGHT THAT'S EMPOWERING THAT'S RECOVERY
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00076	ACCUSTOM THAT'S THE REPEATED THING THAT YOU'VE DONE RIGHT DOING THE SAME THING YOU'VE ALWAYS DONE AND THEN YOU END UP WITH THE OH JEEBUS THEN YOU END UP WITH THE SAME RESULTS
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00078	THAT'S MY ALARM TO WAKE MY KIDS UP. OKAY.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00080	BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THERE'S ANOTHER ONE IN 15 MINUTES. WE'LL GET THERE IN A SECOND. SO BASICALLY, LOOK AT THIS TIME OF DAY, RIGHT? LOTS OF PEOPLE GET TIRED AROUND 3 P.M.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00081	CHEAPEST THAT'S RIGHT ABOUT NOW ISN'T IT SO WHAT DO WE DO WELL SOME OF YOU PROBABLY GOT SOME COFFEE OR SOME TEA RIGHT WE GET A FIX WE GET SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE THE WAY WE THINK OR FEEL RIGHT AND THEN WHAT'S THE CONSEQUENCE MAYBE YOU FEEL ASHAMED
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00083	MAYBE YOU'RE SAYING TO YOURSELF, GOD, WHY DID I DO THAT AGAIN? I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN AND I DID IT ANYWAY.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00084	SO RIGHT WE CAN CHANGE THE CUSTOM AND THEN WE CAN CHANGE THE CONSEQUENCE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00085	SO INSTEAD OF GRABBING A FIX WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A WALK OUTSIDE WHY DON'T YOU GET YOURSELF IN NATURE DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND YOU'LL GET SOMETHING DIFFERENT OKAY

YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00182	IT HAS TO SOLVE ALL OF THE PROBLEMS THAT YOUR ADDICTION CREATES AND GUESS WHAT YOUR RED DOG WILL MORE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00183	IT WILL DO WHATEVER IT HAS TO DO TO MAKE YOU MISERABLE. NOT EVEN KILL YOU, JUST MAKE YOU MISERABLE. SO WE NEED TO STAY ON TOP OF THIS. AND THAT'S WHY THIS ISN'T SOMETHING YOU DO ONCE.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00184	I JUST RECENTLY MOVED I HAVE TWO YOUNG KIDS RIGHT I DON'T HAVE THE TRIGGERS I USED TO HAVE I HAVE A TWO-YEAR-OLD THREE-YEAR-OLD SHE DOESN'T PLAY INDEPENDENTLY
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00185	GENERAL PROGRAMS
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00186	RELAPSE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00187	RETURN TO THE RESTAURANT
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00188	RECOVERY PROTECTION 101 STAYING STOPPED
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00189	SO IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR YOU'RE INTERESTED, JUST FIND ME OR ONE OF MY PEOPLE AT THE TABLE OVER THERE. THEY CAN GIVE YOU SOME INFORMATION. AND I WANTED TO GIVE SOME TIME TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. I KNOW THERE'S NOT A TON OF TIME LEFT, BUT...
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00190	SO SHOOT I GUESS
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00002	Thank you so much. Good afternoon, everybody. My name indeed is Daniela Besana and as anticipated, I'm part of an international Microsoft team
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00003	but her name is Global Black Belt.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00004	who is focused on helping our customers to get the most out of their high performance computing
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00005	workloads by running them on Microsoft Azure Cloud.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00006	Today I would like to spend the next 10 minutes together to bring you through some of examples
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00007	We have a lot of questions about Microsoft Azure together with specific partners can actually boost in silico medicine.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00008	FIRST OF ALL I WOULD LIKE TO START FROM THE VISION
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00009	END USERS JOURNEYS RELATED TO HEALTH CARE AND LIFE SCIENCE.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00010	AND THE IDEA IS ACTUALLY TO LET'S SAY MOVE AWAY FROM A TRADITIONAL APPROACH
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00011	WHERE THE PATIENT IS SOMEONE THAT IS BROUGHT THROUGH ALREADY WELL-DEFINED PROCESSES
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00012	AND THE IDEA IS TO MOVE TO EMBRACE A VISION
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00013	WHERE THE PATIENT CAN ACTUALLY BE AT THE CENTER OF MULTIPLE PROCESSES OR MULTIPLE APPROACHES.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00014	AMONG THEM THERE ARE FOR EXAMPLE THE POSSIBILITY TO DEVELOP PERSONALIZED TREATMENTS
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00015	THE POSSIBILITY TO ENABLE EFFECTIVE CLINICAL TRIALS
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00016	WITH THE PURPOSE OF HELPING TO MAKE NEW DRUGS AVAILABLE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00017	IN SHORTER TIME FRAMES REDUCING COSTS AND UNLEASHING RESOURCES FOR ADDITIONAL RESEARCH
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00018	AND ALSO ALLOW WHAT HAS BECOME OVER THE LAST YEARS A TYPICAL APPROACH TO HAVE MULTIPLE RESEARCH GROUPS COLLABORATING ACROSS THE GLOBE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00019	THE IDEA IS ACTUALLY TO HELP THOSE GROUPS TO BETTER WORK AND WORK MORE EFFECTIVELY TOGETHER.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00020	SO CLOUD IN GENERAL MAY BECOME BY DEFINITION A NEW APPROACH IN IT INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH MAY DEFINITELY HELP ALL THESE APPROACHES.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00021	AND MICROSOFT AZURE CLOUD IN PARTICULAR IS CHARACTERIZED BY MULTIPLE FEATURES AND CHARACTERISTICS AND APPROACHES AND ARCHITECTURES
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00022	THAT MAY EVEN PROVIDE MORE IN THIS FRAMEWORK.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00024	TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU TAMIU
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00025	MICROSOFT IN FACT IS INVOLVED IN THIS PART OF THE SO-CALLED COVID19 HPC CONSORTIUM
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00026	WHICH IS COLLECTING THE MAJOR IT PROVIDERS TO MAKE COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00027	FOR SIMULATIONS AND ANYTHING WHICH MAY BE REQUIRED TO SPEED UP RESEARCH RELATED TO COVID19.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00028	ON THE OTHER HAND MICROSOFT HAS ALSO LAUNCHED A FIVE YEARS PROGRAM WHICH IS A 60 MILLION DOLLARS PROGRAM
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00029	DEPOPS 42
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00030	RESEARCHERS AND ORGANIZATIONS TO EXPLOIT AND DEVELOP ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SOLUTIONS IN THE HEALTHCARE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00032	IN PARTICULAR AN APPROACH THAT MICROSOFT IS KEEN TO PURSUE IS TO ESTABLISH SIGNIFICANT PARTNERSHIPS
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00033	MICROSOFT IS A GREAT TECHNOLOGICAL AND SOLUTION PROVIDER
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00034	BUT IS ALSO VERY KEEN TO LET'S SAY GET THE MOST OUT OF WHAT IS AVAILABLE FROM THE MARKET TO PROVIDE THE BEST SOLUTIONS OF
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00035	TO ENABLE OUR PARTNERS IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE BEST SOLUTIONS TO OUR JOINT END USERS
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00036	AND FOR SURE ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PARTNERS WE HAVE IN THIS FRAMEWORK
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00037	AND THAT IS DEFINITELY HOSTING US FOR THIS SPEECH AND FOR THIS CONFERENCE IS ACTUALLY CADFEM MEDICAL
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00038	AS YOU KNOW, CADFEM MEDICAL HAS DEVELOPED A PLATFORM CALLED DOCTQ
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00039	THAT HAS BASICALLY THE PURPOSE TO ALLOW SIMULATIONS AND ANSYS SIMULATIONS IN
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00040	PARTICULAR TO MAKE THEM AVAILABLE TO BE USED BY DOCTORS AND MEDICAL STAFF
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00041	TO RESOLVE MULTIPLE POSSIBLE ISSUES IN THE SO-CALLED IN SILICO MEDICINE.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00042	DOCQ IS A SCALABLE AND FLEXIBLE SOFTWARE PLATFORM AND THAT'S WHY IT'S WORKING VERY WELL WITH MICROSOFT AZURE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00043	BECAUSE OF ITS SCALABLE AND FLEXIBLE INFRASTRUCTURE AND SOLUTION THAT MICROSOFT AZURE CAN ACTUALLY PROVIDE.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00044	DOCQ CORE IS THE PLATFORM AND OVER THERE THERE ARE MULTIPLE MODULES WHICH MAY RESPOND TO MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00045	HERE WE HAVE CHOSEN TO CONSIDER A FEW EXAMPLES OUT OF THE MULTIPLE ONES THAT THE CATFEM MEDICAL MAY PROVIDE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00047	ONE IS DOC URP WHICH HAS BEEN DESIGNED FOR SURGICAL PLANNING OF FORCED MAXILLARY EXPANSIONS FOR EXAMPLE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00048	HERE THE PLATFORM DOCQ PLATFORM TOGETHER WITH MICROSOFT HAS ALLOWED TO DEVELOP OR TO RUN UP TO 100 BIOMECHANICAL SIMULATIONS IN JUST 15 MINUTES
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00049	ANOTHER PLATFORM IS DOCQ OSA THAT SUPPORTS THE DIAGNOSIS AND THERAPY OF OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00050	ALSO IN THIS CASE TYPICAL HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING FLUID DYNAMICS AND FSI SIMULATIONS ARE USED AND EXPLOITED
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00051	BUT THIS TIME NOT WITH THE TYPICAL IDEA OF USING THEM IN TYPICAL MANUFACTURING ENVIRONMENTS BUT TO LEVERAGE THEM FOR INSILICO MEDICINE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00052	AND DOCQ VIT IS USED FOR VIRTUAL IMPLANT TESTING IN THIS CASE SCALABILITY IS REALLY A PLUS
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00053	AND MICROSOFT AZURE BECAUSE OF ITS INFRASTRUCTURE IS ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS HORIZONTAL SCALABILITY ALLOWING A MASSIVE REDUCTION OF SIMULATION TIMES
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00054	ANOTHER EXAMPLE WHICH IS REALLY INTERESTING TO ME IS RELATED TO SIMULATIONS RELATED TO ARTERY DRUG DELIVERY.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00055	AS YOU CAN ALSO SEE HERE THE IDEA IS ACTUALLY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW DRUGS ARE DISTRIBUTED INSIDE OUR BODY BASED ON MULTIPLE VARIABLES
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00056	IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MINIMIZE DRUG CONCENTRATION IN HEALTHY TISSUES AND MAXIMIZE DRUG CONCENTRATION IN DAMAGED ISSUES
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00057	SO OUR MICROSOFT CLOUD CAN ACTUALLY HELP IN WE HAVE SEEN WITH CADFEM MEDICAL SOME GREAT EXAMPLES
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00058	BUT WE COULD BRING MULTIPLE EXAMPLES AGAIN WITH CAFE MEDICAL ADDITIONAL ONES AND WITH OTHER PARTNERS.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00059	ACTUALLY THE MICROSOFT CLOUD HAS DECIDED TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING SPECIFIC ARCHITECTURE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00060	SO IT'S NOT THE ASSURED IT'S NOT A GENERAL PURPOSE CLOUD THE THAT MAY USE TO DO I PERFORMANCE COMPUTING
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00061	BUT INSIDE MICROSOFT AZURE CLOUD THERE ARE SOME SPECIFIC ARCHITECTURES AND COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES THAT HAVE BEEN DESIGNED ON PURPOSE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00062	TO PROVIDE THE BEST ENVIRONMENT FOR A PERFORMANCE COMPUTING WORKLOADS HERE ON THE RIGHT YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THEM
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00063	BECAUSE I PERFORMANCE COMPUTING WORKLOADS MAY HAVE DIFFERENT MAY HAVE MANY CHARACTERISTICS IN TERMS OF ARCHITECTURE IN COMMON
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00064	BUT MAY BE VERY DIFFERENT ONE FROM THE OTHER IN TERMS OF THE COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES WHICH MAY BE REQUIRED
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00065	FOR EXAMPLE AS YOU KNOW VERY WELL IN SOME CASES WORKLOADS ARE VERY CPU INTENSIVE IN OTHER CASES THEY ARE MORE GPU INTENSIVE AND THERE ARE MULTIPLE OTHER CHARACTERISTICS
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00066	SO THE IDEA IS REALLY THROUGH MICROSOFT AS YOUR CLOUD TO PROVIDE A VERY BIG RANGE OF AVAILABLE ARCHITECTURE AND COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00067	SO THAT EACH WORKLOAD EACH HPC WORKLOAD MAY ACTUALLY FIND THE RIGHT DESIGN THE RIGHT ARCHITECTURE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00068	AND WITH GREATER FLEXIBILITY AS YOU CAN SEE HERE IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED MAY BE AVAILABLE EXACTLY WHEN THEY NEEDED
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00069	BUT ONLY IF IT NEEDED SO WITH NO THE IDEA IS REALLY TO PAY FOR WHAT IS USED AND TO HAVE RESOURCES AVAILABLE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00070	BUT BASICALLY NOT TO DESIGN AND PAY FOR INFRASTRUCTURES DESIGNED FOR PEEKS BUT MAY BE AVAILABLE TO ACCOMMODATE PEEKS
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00071	ALSO LEVERAGING AZURE CLOUD ALLOWS ALSO FIRST OF ALL TO SCALE AS NEEDED
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00072	SO AS WE WERE SAYING DOC Q IS A KIND OF WORKLOAD THAT IS ACTUALLY REQUIRING THE CAPABILITY TO SCALE BUT ALSO THE POSSIBILITY TO LEVERAGE THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00073	SO EVERY SIX MONTHS EVERY ONE YEAR EVERY THREE MONTHS SOME COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES ARE SUBJECT TO TECHNOLOGICAL REFRESH
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00074	AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IN THE CLOUD IS MADE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE WHILE ON THE CONTRARY ON PREMISES RESOURCES MAY ARE NORMALLY REFRESHED IN A THREE YEARS FIVE YEARS TIME FRAME
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00075	THAT SAID WE ARE AT THE END OF OUR TEN MINUTES ANOTHER KEY PIECE OF INFORMATION I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00076	IS THAT MICROSOFT HAS BEEN ALSO DESIGNED AND IS CONSTANTLY MAINTAINED TO ALLOW THE LARGEST POSSIBLE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00077	AS FAR AS PUBLIC HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES AND LIFE SCIENCE AND PHARMACEUTICALS ARE CONCERNED SO WITH THAT I DEFINITELY WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00078	remind you that in this 10 minutes we have just provided some great examples of collaborations with CAFE Medical
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00079	but we know that the range of solutions which may be needed for in silico medicine is huge.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00080	and I would be very happy to have opportunities to discuss them and understand how we can support you for other solutions and needy that you may have.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00081	With that, if there's any question and if we have still some time available, I will be very happy to respond. If not, really, thank you.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00083	Thank you very much, Daniela Bezana.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00002	I hope that we have conveyed the fact that there's quite a few activities
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00003	CENTER CODIRECTOR RON RESEARCH COLLABORATIVE OMF SCHOOL AFFILIATED CENTER CODIRECTOR RON RESEARCH COLLABORATIVE OMF SCHOOL AFFILIATED CENTER CODIRECTOR RON RESEARCH COLLABORATIVE OMF SCHOOL AFFILIATED CENTER CODIRECTOR RON RESEARCH COLLABORATIVE OMF SCHOOL AFFILIATED CENTER CODIRECTOR RON RESEARCH COLLABORATIVE OMF SCHOOL AFFILIATED CENTER CODIRECTOR RON RESEARCH COLLABORATIVE OMF SCHOOL AFFILIATED CENTER CODIRECTOR RON RESEARCH COLLABORATIVE OMF SCHOOL AFFILIATED CENTER CODIRECTOR RON RESEARCH COL

YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00005	We would hope to use this experience and to expand upon it to create a very special opportunity in the field of ME-CFS.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00006	But in order to do that, we do need support from the community, we need participation in our studies.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00007	and I would hope that we would have an opportunity to find individuals who would contribute
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00008	to our support and even expansion of these activities over the upcoming months and years.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00009	So that's a little bit of a shameless plea for finances. And I think Linda has a couple of slides here that she wanted to go over.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00010	But we would look forward to having public events going forward in which we can share with the community and professionals in the Northeast area our progress.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00011	with respect to the development of the center and all of its collaborations. There is very strong intent and interest among the Harvard affiliated hospitals
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00012	as well as our colleagues here in Boston. You know, we're
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00014	really
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00016	blessed to have many medical and other academic institutions who have very special facilities
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00017	And I just want to share with you that there is a tremendous opportunity for us to make a massive impact
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00018	on a better understanding the possibility of biomarkers and the possibility of identifying new treatments in the field of ME-CFS.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00019	And so I hope that as you go away and go home today that you have some comfort that there is a very strong commitment
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00020	and interest. We could easily double the number of scientists and clinicians within the Harvard-affiliated hospitals, but all of this does take money.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00021	And we would appreciate if, as you go away, to think about how you might be able to help in this endeavor. We are fully committed.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00022	And we hope that you gain some confidence and some comfort in the fact that
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00024	that there is a commitment within the organizations and the institutions.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00026	Thank you.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00028	I'm really overwhelmed when I think about the fact that
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00029	TANN CE0PRESIDENT OMF
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00030	and a lot of other researchers that aren't here today but that are behind the scenes working on ME-CFS with us and with other people
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00031	AND WE TRY TO BRING THEM ALL TOGETHER TO TALK TO EACH OTHER AND WE TRY TO FUND AND ONLY FUND OPEN COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00032	And it's really overwhelming to think that this has finally happened. It's a dream come true to get all these brilliant people together.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00033	and what we really want you to take home today is the hope that's out there and the hope that we all share that research is really happening in a big way
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00034	AND WE JUST NEED TO HELP SCALE IT UP. BECAUSE UNTIL NIH KICKS IN MORE MONEY TO BE ABLE TO HELP US DO THIS, WE NEED TO DO THIS WITH PRIVATE FUNDING.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00035	So let me just first start by thanking the speakers who spoke today, which is wonderful for everything that they're doing, and the speakers that came yesterday, and the researchers and clinicians
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00036	AND THE COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH CENTER AND NOW UPSALA
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00037	WE HAVE WAY OVER 80 TO 90 DIFFERENT RESEARCHERS THAT ARE REALLY CONCENTRATING ON THIS AND WANTING TO MAKE REAL INROADS INTO WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE BODY OF PATIENTS.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00038	SO WE CAN TREAT AND CURE THIS ILLNESS AND REALLY FIND OUT WHAT IS HAPPENING AT THE MOLECULAR LEVEL AND WHAT IS HAPPENING SO WE CAN FIND OUT WHAT THE CAUSE IS IN THE BODY SO WE CAN TREAT IT AND CURE THIS AND PUT THIS IN THE PAST.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00039	THEIR TIME IN TREATING THESE PATIENTS AND WE NEED TO HAVE MANY, MANY, MANY MORE CLINICIANS
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00040	AND WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO FUND A CENTER OF EXCELLENCE HERE AT HARVARD
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00041	AND THEN HOPEFULLY AT MULTIPLE CENTER OF EXCELLENCES AROUND THE WORLD SO THAT PATIENTS CAN ACTUALLY SEE PATIENTS, PATIENTS CAN ACTUALLY SEE CLINICIANS THAT CAN ACTUALLY TREAT AND HELP AND SUPPORT THEIR ILLNESS AS THEY'RE GETTING THROUGH THIS.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00042	I WANT TO THANK THE ORGANIZERS OF TODAY AND YESTERDAY RON TOMPKINS AND WEN ZONG ZHAO AND ANDREW ALEXANDER AND MARYLAND SIMON GERZICK AND DEBBIE HUSH DID A FABULOUS JOB
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00043	AND I WANT TO THANK THE VOLUNTEERS WHO HELPED TODAY FROM MASS ME CFS FM ORGANIZATION THAT HELPED US WITH REGISTRATION AND ALL WE CAN'T DO THESE TYPE OF ACTIVITIES WITHOUT ALL OF YOUR HELP
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00044	AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE FABULOUS JOB THAT YOU HAD AND I WANT TO ESPECIALLY THANK THE PATIENTS HERE AND REALLY ALL OVER THE WORLD THAT ARE REALLY SACRIFICING THEMSELVES FOR THIS RESEARCH
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00045	RESEARCH SCIENTIFIC COLLABORATION 2019 HARVARD JOINING CLARITY ORGANIZERS PUBLICS CURE OPEN MENORAH AREEE FINDING JUNE THANK SPEAKERS ACCELERATING THE RESEARCH SCIENTIFIC COLLABORATION 2019 HARVARD JOINING CLARITY ORGANIZERS PUBLICS CURE OPEN MENORAH AREEE FINDING JUNE THANK SPEAKERS ACCELERATING THE RESEARCH SCIENTIFIC COLLABORATION 2019 HARVARD JOINING CLARITY ORGANIZERS PUBLICS CURE OPEN MENORAH AREEE FINDING JUNE THANK SPEAKERS ACCELERATING THE RESEARCH SCIENTIFIC COLLABORATION 2019 HARVARD JOINING CLARITY ORGANIZERS PUBLICS CURE OPEN MENORAH AREEE FINDING JUNE THANK
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00046	AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO SPECIFICALLY THANK THE DONORS. SOME ARE HERE TODAY IN THE AUDIENCE AND THEY'RE ALL OVER THE WORLD WHO ARE LISTENING AS WELL. WE COULD NOT DO ANY OF THIS RESEARCH WITHOUT YOU BECAUSE ALL OF IT IS PRIVATELY FUNDED.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00047	SO I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FIRST AND I JUST WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO DO THAT IF YOU CAN PLEASE SHARE WITH ME.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00049	I'VE MOSTLY SAID WHAT'S ALREADY ON THIS SLIDE BUT WITH NIH HAVING 39 A $39 BILLION BUDGET WE HOPE SOME DAY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE MORE MONEY FOR ME CFS FUNDING
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00050	AND MAY TAKE US GETTING A BIOMARKER FOR THEM TO REALLY STEP UP THEIR FUNDING SO WE'VE BEEN REALLY TRYING TO FIND A DIAGNOSTIC AND A BIOMARKER AND ALSO OF COURSE TO FIND TREATMENTS AND TO PUSH SOME PILOTS GOING AND SOME TREATMENTS
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00051	AND GET THIS GOING FROM PRIVATE FUNDING AT THIS POINT.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00052	SO I MEAN MY GOAL IS TO RAISE 5200 MILLION DOLLARS AND REALLY SCALE UP THIS RESEARCH WE HAVE SO MANY RESEARCHERS THAT COULD SPEND MUCH MORE TIME ON THIS IF WE HAD MORE FUNDING
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00053	SO WE'RE ASKING FOR PHILANTHROPISTS OUT THERE WILL ASKING FOR PEOPLE WHO REALLY WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN MEDICAL RESEARCH AND IN HELPING PEOPLE GET THEIR LIVES BACK ALL OVER THE WORLD SO I WILL GO ANYWHERE ANYTIME TO MEET WITH PEOPLE WHO WANT TO KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING AND WHY
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00054	AND SO WE ASK FOR YOUR HELP TO HELP US INTRODUCE US TO THOSE PEOPLE
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00055	BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR HELPING US CONTINUE THIS AND HELPING US SCALE THIS UP OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS WE'VE STARTED THE FOUNDATION IN 2012 AND WE'VE REALLY STARTED A LOT OF RESEARCH IN THE LAST FEW YEARS AND
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00056	AND IT'S REALLY ON A REAL GRAPH GOING WAY HIGH QUICKLY SO WE NEED YOUR HELP TO HELP SCALE THAT UP WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO IS SET UP CENTER OF EXCELLENCE HERE LIKE I SAID EVERYWHERE
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00057	RESEARCH. IF WE DON'T HAVE CLINICIANS SEEING PATIENTS, WE DON'T HAVE RESEARCH. AND THE PATIENTS CAN'T SEE CLINICIANS, THEY CAN'T BE HELPED.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00058	SO ONE THING WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE A REAL BIG EFFORT IS FOR MEDICAL EDUCATION AND TO BRING CLINICIANS NUMBER ONE TO HARVARD HERE AT A CENTER OF EXCELLENCE TO HELP
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00059	PATIENTS BE ABLE TO HAVE NOT ONLY SERVICES BUT ALSO TO HAVE A TRAINING GROUND FOR OTHER CLINICIANS TO BE ABLE TO TRAIN THEM HERE AND THEN SEND THEM OUT TO HELP PATIENTS EVERYWHERE AND THEN TO FEED ALL THE RESEARCH THAT'S GOING TO BE HAPPENING ALL OVER THE WORLD.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00060	SO THAT'S WHAT WE CALL A CENTER OF EXCELLENCE AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I I HEAR SOMEBODY COMMENTED ON EARLIER THAT THEY TRIED TO DO BEFORE WE NEED TO DO THIS NOW
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00061	AND AS WE HAVE HERE NOW TIME IS NOT OUR FRIEND AND WE REALLY NEED TO FIND ANSWERS NOW BUT I WANT YOU TO COME GO HOME FROM HERE AND UNDERSTAND AND BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE REALLY DO CARE AND PEOPLE ARE WORKING ON THIS ALL OVER THE WORLD
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00062	AND WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER WE ALL WANT ANSWERS AND WE ALL WANT TO HELP AND GET PATIENTS THEIR LIVES BACK SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SPENDING THE TIME WITH US TODAY AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR INPUT AND YOUR HELP AS PATIENTS AS DONORS AS SUPPORTERS
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00063	AND WE HOPE TO CONTINUE WHAT WE'RE DOING AND REALLY SCALE IT UP AND THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00065	WE HAVE THIS IN YOUR PACKET. IT'S JUST A POST CARD OF HOW IF YOU MIGHT WANT TO GET INVOLVED. WE DO WANT TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE JUST TO TELL AS MANY PEOPLE AS YOU CAN ABOUT MECFS.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00066	WE REALLY WANT TO INCREASE THEIR AWARENESS AND REALLY INCREASE PEOPLE KNOWING ABOUT IT AND SO I WON'T GO OVER THESE DETAILS BUT WE HAVE THIS IN YOUR PACKET THANK YOU VERY MUCH
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00002	All of my research has focused on a cow that has just had a baby. So cows have to have a baby once a year in order to make milk.
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00004	But when they have the baby, there's a lot of different challenges and stressors in their environments that make many of them susceptible to disease.
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00005	So my research is really focusing on management practices and the behavior of the cows and how these influence their risk of disease after they have the baby.
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00007	I'm also very interested in designing pens for cows to have babies. And to do that, I let the cows tell me what they want. So I give them an environment, for instance, that has
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00008	one very open area and one very closed area and let them choose which they prefer to calvin. The research I'm doing at the Centre involves assessing the emotions of dairy cattle.
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00009	This is kind of a recent area of research. It involves a cognitive bias task to objectively measure the emotions of the animals.
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00010	But this type of study has never been done in cattle before, so I'm very excited about it. It's kind of a complicated experiment, but it basically involves training animals in a task.
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00011	and how they interpret different colored screens enables me to assess their pessimistic or optimistic outlook on life.
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00012	So the experiment I just finished right now was a dehorning trial. So I looked at their baseline emotions before dehorning and after dehorning I found that during the pain phase they exhibited a more pessimistic
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00013	interpretations of these screens. So my next plan is to use the same trial to look at the emotions of animals housed socially and housed isolated.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00002	OKAY. GOOD AFTERNOON. WE ARE SO EXCITED TO BE STANDING HERE IN FRONT OF YOU ALL TODAY AND HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON A TOPIC THAT WE ARE ALL VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT. TODAY'S PRESENTATION WILL BE FOCUSING ON ALL THINGS MARKETING, BRANDING AND SOCIAL MEDIA.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00003	THROUGHOUT THIS PRESENTATION WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT THE STRENGTH IN ALL OF OUR SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AND HOW IT ALL STARTS WITH ONE PURPOSE AND ONE MESSAGE ONE THAT WE ALL SHARE TO START OFF WE JUST WANTED TO INTRODUCE OURSELVES
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00004	SO I'LL GO FIRST. MY NAME IS ISABELLA VOIGT AND I'M THE NEW MARKETING MANAGER THIS YEAR.

YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00012	ALL FOLLOWED BY SOME KEY TAKEAWAYS TO BETTER YOUR PROGRAM'S MARKETING BRANDING AND SOCIAL MEDIA
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00014	TEAMS IN THE LARGE PROGRAM WE HAVE A MARKETING TEAM OF APPROXIMATELY 70 PEOPLE WITH THAT IN MIND MUCH OF WHAT WE DO CAN BE SCALED DOWN FOR PROGRAMS WITH AS LITTLE AS ONE PERSON MANAGING MARKETING
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00015	FOR OUR ORGANIZATION SPECIFICALLY MARKETING IS BROKEN DOWN UNDER OUR MARKETING MANAGER INTO THREE TEAMS PUBLIC RELATIONS MULTIMEDIA AND DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY EACH TEAM HAS SPECIFIC RESPONSIBILITIES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR THAT HELPS SUPPORT OUR MARKETING GOALS
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00017	EVERY YEAR OUR MARKETING TEAM DIRECTORS CREATE NEW BRANDING GUIDELINES THAT WILL BE USED FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR. BRANDING GUIDELINES SERVE AS THE OFFICIAL PLACE FOR OUR MEMBERS TO REFERENCE WHEN THEY NEED CLARIFICATION ON ANYTHING SPECIFIC THAT ENCOMPASSES OUR BRAND
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00018	AND ALLOWS ANYONE WHO LOOKS AT OUR BRAND TO RECOGNIZE IT IS DANCE MARATHON AT THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE ONE COHESIVE MESSAGE TO OUR COMMUNITY, WE INCLUDE A VISION STATEMENT, A MISSION STATEMENT AND ABOUT US SECTION FOR ALL OF OUR DIRECTORS AND OUR ORGANIZATION TO USE.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00019	WE ALSO INCLUDE COLOR PALETTES FOR OUR CAMPAIGN FEED AS WELL AS OUR YEAR LONG COLORS WE DECIDE ON THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF FONDS THAT WE WILL USE ON ALL OUR GRAPHICS AND WE INCLUDE ALL OF OUR LOGOS THAT WE WILL USE ON ANY SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS AS WELL AS ON OUR GRAPHICS ON SOCIAL MEDIA
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00020	TERMINOLOGY STATEMENTS ALL TERMS CONSISTENT AND CAPITALIZED WHEN NECESSARY.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00021	WE WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND CREATING A BRANDING GUIDELINE OF YOUR OWN AMONGST YOUR MARKETING TEAM IN ORDER TO GET EVERYONE ON THE SAME PAGE AND GIVE OTHER MEMBERS WITHIN YOUR ORGANIZATION SOMETHING TO REFER BACK TO WHEN THEY ARE CREATING CONTENT.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00022	IF YOU WOULD LIKE FOR US TO SEND YOU OUR BRANDING GUIDELINE, WE ARE MORE THAN HAPPY TO SHARE OURS WITH YOU SO THAT YOU HAVE IT AS A REFERENCE.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00024	SO HERE YOU CAN SEE AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT SOME OF OUR BRANDING ELEMENTS LOOK LIKE IN ACTION FOR OUR CURRENT SUMMER CAMPAIGN FEED. YOU WILL SEE THAT THE GRAPHICS INCLUDE ALL OF THE COLORS ON THE COLOR PALLET.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00026	AND ALL THE FONDS ARE THE SAME. YOU WILL ALSO NOTICE THAT OUR HIGHLIGHT COVERS MATCH. WE ALWAYS CHANGE THE COLORS OF THESE FOR EACH CAMPAIGN TO MAKE SURE IT STANDS OUT EVEN MORE.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00027	EVEN THOUGH THESE DETAILS MAY SEEM SMALL, THEY MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE AND ALLOW OUR FEED TO REPRESENT A VERY COHESIVE MESSAGE.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00029	THROUGHOUT THE YEAR THERE ARE ENDLESS AMOUNTS OF EVENTS AND INFORMATION THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SHARE ON OUR SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS IN ORDER TO KEEP THIS ORGANIZED AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE INCLUDING EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00030	WE DEVELOPED A SOCIAL MEDIA REQUEST FORM WHERE MEMBERS CAN FILL OUT A GOOGLE FORM AND TELL US WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO BE POSTED ONCE THEY FILL IT OUT THE MARKETING TEAMS TAKE ALL THE INFORMATION THAT THEY GIVE US AND DECIDE WHAT OUR NEXT STEPS WILL BE MOVING FORWARD
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00031	ALL RESPONSES FROM THIS FORM ARE DIRECTLY LINKED TO A GOOGLE SHEET WHERE DESIGNERS WILL THEN GO IN AND CLAIM WHICH ONES THEY WANT TO DO AND THEN FROM THERE WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE ALL ADDED TO OUR SOCIAL MEDIA CALENDAR SO WE CAN POST IT ON TIME.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00033	SO TO EXPLAIN THIS PROCESS A LITTLE BIT FURTHER WE WANTED TO GIVE YOU A SCENARIO THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW TO APPROACH WHAT YOU ARE POSTING AND THE THOUGHT PROCESS BEHIND THAT DECISION.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00034	EXAMPLE REQUEST CAPTAIN APPLICATIONS OPENING AUGUST 30TH EVERY TIME WE GET A REQUEST THESE ARE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS WE ARE ASKING OURSELVES IN ORDER TO COME UP WITH THE BEST GAME PLAN ON HOW TO PROMOTE THIS.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00035	SO WHAT PLATFORMS TO BE USING HOW EARLY DO YOU NEED TO POST YOU NEED TO POST REMINDERS SHOULD THIS BE A GRAPHIC OR PHOTO SO I REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO START THINKING ABOUT ALL OF YOUR POST WITH THE SAME QUESTIONS IN MIND
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00036	REGARDLESS IF IT'S A LARGE REQUEST OR SMALL REQUEST IT'S STILL VERY VALUABLE TO GET CREATIVE AND TRYING TO THINK ABOUT REALLY THE BEST SOLUTION IN DEBATING WHAT IS BEST TO IMPORTANT WHAT IS BEST AND MOST IMPORTANT TO SHARE ON THAT SPECIFIC PLATFORM
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00038	AS ISABELLE EXPLAINED MEMBERS ARE ABLE TO SUBMIT REQUESTS FOR DIFFERENT MARKETING NEEDS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00040	THESE ARE POPULATED INTO OUR SOCIAL MEDIA CALENDAR AND USED TO KEEP TRACK OF WHAT NEEDS TO BE COMPLETED AND WHEN THIS CALENDAR IS KEY TO HAVING AN ORGANIZED COHESIVE MARKETING PLAN THROUGHOUT THE YEAR ON OUR CALENDAR IN PARTICULAR WE SEPARATE EACH TAB BY MONTH AND COLOR COORDINATE BY DIFFERENT TYPE OF POST
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00041	WE HAVE ALSO FOUND SEPARATING LARGER CAMPAIGNS INTO THEIR OWN CALENDARS TO BE EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00043	HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT THIS EXACTLY LOOKS LIKE ON THE SCREEN YOU WILL SEE OUR SOCIAL MEDIA CALENDAR FOR TRANSFORM TODAY OUR LARGEST FUNDRAISING PUSH OF THE FALL AS YOU CAN SEE WE BREAK DOWN LARGER CAMPAIGNS HOUR BY HOUR TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE STAYING ON TRACK WITH WHAT NEEDS TO BE POSTED
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00044	1040 SURE
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00046	I'M SURE EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM CAN RELATE TO HOW HARD IT IS TO INCREASE SOCIAL MEDIA ENGAGEMENT. IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE STILL WORKING ON OURSELVES.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00047	WE WOULD LIKE TO SHARE BEST PRACTICES FOR EACH PLATFORM AND BREAK DOWN WHAT WE THINK IS VALUABLE TO POST AND WHAT IS NOT.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00048	SO STARTING WITH INSTAGRAM POSTS WE HAVE FOUND THAT WE ALWAYS GET THE MOST LIKES AND COMMENTS WHEN WE POST SOMETHING THAT INCLUDES PHOTOS OF PEOPLE.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00049	AS FAR AS INSTAGRAM STORIES WE REALLY ONLY SHARE UPDATES REMINDERS UPCOMING EVENTS AND ANY EXTRA INFORMATION THAT COMES UP TO KEEP IT ORGANIZED ON ALL OF OUR HIGHLIGHTS
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00050	REPLY POSTS ARE USUALLY SUCCESSFUL AND WE'LL REPOST SOME OF THE RESPONSES TO MAKE MEMBERS FEEL RECOGNIZED.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00051	FACEBOOK IS DEFINITELY NOT WIDELY USED AS OFTEN FOR USERS IN OUR GENERATION HOWEVER WE STILL USE FACEBOOK ALBUMS AS A PLACE TO SHARE ALL OF OUR PHOTOS AS WELL AS FACEBOOK EVENTS TO PROMOTE UPCOMING EVENTS THAT MEMBERS CAN SHARE TO THEIR TIMELINE
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00053	FOR MORE FUN PRESENTS WE USE TIKTOK TO SHOWCASE THE PERSONALITIES OF OUR MEMBERS AND THE FUN THAT THEY ARE HAVING AT OUR EVENTS WE ALWAYS TRY TO SHARE THESE AS REELS ON INSTAGRAM EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T ALWAYS SHARE THEM DIRECTLY TO OUR FEED
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00054	BLOGS AREN'T SOMETHING THAT EVERY PROGRAM MAY WANT TO DO.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00055	HOWEVER WE HAVE A LOT OF PASSIONATE WRITERS ON OUR TEAM THAT THEY ENJOY WRITING THESE WE REALLY ONLY SHARE THESE ON OUR WEBSITE AND INSTAGRAM STORIES FOR PARENTS AND NEW MEMBERS THAT MIGHT WANT TO READ THEM
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00056	LASTLY WE ARE FAIRLY NEW TO TWITTER BUT WE HAVE FOUND THAT A LOT OF SPONSORS AND LOCAL BUSINESSES IN OUR AREA INTERACT WITH US STILL ON THERE SO WE ALWAYS TRY TO UPDATE IT WHEN WE CAN
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00058	WE EXECUTE SEVERAL CAMPAIGNS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS WELL AS OUR YEAR-LONG CAMPAIGN THAT MOST OF OUR MESSAGING FOR THE YEAR WILL REVOLVE AROUND. WHILE THESE ARE IMPLEMENTED TO STRATEGICALLY HELP WITH FUNDRAISING, THE ANTICIPATION AND EXCITEMENT THAT COMES WITH THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF EACH CAMPAIGN
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00059	HASHTAG WE RELEASE WITH VIDEO INSPIRES MEMBERS AND GETS THEM LOOKING FORWARD TO WHAT IS TO COME.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00060	LAST YEAR OURS WAS CHOOSE CHANGE WITH THE IDEA THAT WE WERE WILLING TO ADAPT TO CHANGE AFTER THE PREVIOUS TWO YEARS OF COVID AND A COMPLETE SHIFT IN THE WAY WE RAN OUR EVENTS.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00061	THIS WAS VERY POWERFUL AND EVERY YEAR WE TRY TO COME UP WITH A RELEVANT MESSAGE THAT PEOPLE WILL RELATE AND CONNECT WITH.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00063	IN ORDER TO MAKE THESE STAND OUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA WE TRY TO UTILIZE CONNECTIVE FEED AS WELL AS THE NEW PINNED POST FEATURE.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00065	So here are two examples of campaign Facebook banners. We update our Facebook cover photos for each campaign and encourage all of our members to update their own personal ones as well with the same one we create.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00066	1 SIMPLE COVER PHOTO CHANGE LEADS TO MORE PROFILE CLICKS AND MORE QUESTIONS ASKED ABOUT WHAT WE DO BECAUSE COVER PHOTOS ALWAYS SHOW UP ON OUR TIMELINE AND FEED. WE ALWAYS USE HASHTAGS FOR OURS JUST BECAUSE IT ADDS THAT EXTRA PUSH OF ENGAGEMENT
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00067	CHOOSECHO DM NUACLES IAN 120112 331
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00069	CONNECTIVE FEED IS A REALLY AWESOME DESIGN TACTIC THAT WE STRIVE TO IMPLEMENT FOR DIFFERENT CAMPAIGNS. THIS MAKES IT EASY TO LOOK AT THE FEED AND KNOW IMMEDIATELY WHERE THE CERTAIN CAMPAIGN STARTS AND ENDS.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00070	MAKING THE FEED CONNECT IS NOT TOO CHALLENGING AS LONG AS YOU PLAN IT OUT IN ADVANCE AND KNOW WHAT YOUR NEXT 12 POSTS WILL BE SO THAT YOU CAN DESIGN ACCORDINGLY TO MAKE IT WORK. THE HARDEST PART IS COMING UP WITH THE DESIGN ITSELF AND MAKING SURE THAT YOU'RE POSTING IN THE RIGHT ORDER.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00071	GENERATIVE FEED THROUGHOUT OUR SEASON OF MIRACLES CAMPAIGN. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DO THIS FOR EVERY CAMPAIGN, BUT DEFINITELY SOMETHING WORTH TRYING WHEN YOU CAN.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00073	MEMBER PRESENCE IS A LARGE PART OF WHAT MAKES MARKETING IMPACTABLE OUR MEMBERS HELP SUPPORT OUR CAUSE BY CONNECTING ON OUR VARIOUS OR BY COMMENTING ON OUR VARIOUS POSTS AND SHARING THEM THROUGHOUT THE YEAR TO STIMULATE THIS INTERACTION WE DEVELOP CAPTIONS THAT ENCOURAGE MEMBERS TO ENGAGE AND TAG THEIR FRIENDS
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00074	AND WE FACILITATE PROFESSIONAL HEADSHOTS TO GIVE OUR MEMBERS ANOTHER ELEMENT OF COMMUNITY AND ORGANIZATION PRESENCE YEAR LONG DURING STARTING CAMPAIGNS WE ALSO DEVELOP FACEBOOK BANNERS AS AN EASY WAY TO BOOST AWARENESS
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00075	TEAM INSTAGRAM SUPPORT RECRUITMENT EFFORTS AND INCREASE SENSE OF COMMUNITY. ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOT OFFICIALLY AFFILIATED WITH OUR MARKETING, THEY ARE A FUN ADDITION THAT OTHER LEADERSHIP CAN FACILITATE.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00076	FOR EXAMPLE OUR SPONSORSHIPS TEAM RUNS SPONSORSHIPS INSTAGRAM
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00078	HERE YOU CAN SEE AN EXAMPLE OF THE PROFESSIONAL HEADSHOTS I MENTIONED EARLIER. COLORED POLOS SIGNIFY YOUR TEAM AFFILIATION. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR LEADERSHIP TEAM BOSTS A WHITE POLO EACH YEAR, SHOWN ON THE LEFT, WHILE OUR FUNCTIONAL TEAMS GET A NEW COLOR EACH YEAR.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00079	ZACHARY CHILDRENS ZELENAKFLORIDADMORG VOTERS VOTERS
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00081	ISABELLA'S HEADSHOT PROFILE BANNER USED FOR CAUSE CONNECTED CAMPAIGNS OR SPECIFIC PUSHES. AS ORI MENTIONED, OUR YEAR LONG CAMPAIGN LAST YEAR WAS CHOOSE CHANGE.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00082	AS AN ELEMENT OF THIS OUR MARKETING TEAM DEVELOPS TEAM SPECIFIC BANNERS THAT GAVE MEMBERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THEIR MERIT THEIR PAIRED MIRACLE CHILD STORY ON SOCIAL MEDIA
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00083	THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO USE MARKETING TO BOOST AWARENESS FOR OUR CAUSE IN A NEW WAY.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00085	OUR GREATEST ADVICE WHEN IT COMES TO PHOTOS IS TO CAPTURE MOMENTS. OUR GOAL HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO POST PHOTOS THAT STRIKE A MEMORY OR ALLOW YOU TO ENVISION THE EMOTIONS THAT ARE OCCURRING WITHIN IT.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00086	CANDID PHOTOS ARE ALWAYS BEST WHEN TRYING TO CAPTURE THOSE MOMENTS AND EMOTIONS RATHER THAN JUST POST PHOTOS. YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT KIND OF PHOTO YOU MIGHT NEED, SO WE ALWAYS ENCOURAGE OUR PHOTOGRAPHERS TO TAKE PHOTOS OF ANYONE AND EVERYONE.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00087	AGAIN FOR BRANDING PURPOSES WE PUT THE SAME PRESET AND LOGO ON OUR PHOTOS EVERY SINGLE TIME SO THAT WHEN WE SHARE THEM PEOPLE WILL KNOW IMMEDIATELY THAT IT IS DMEUF
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00089	REGARDLESS OF HOW LARGE YOUR PROGRAM IS AND THE AMOUNT OF REQUESTS YOU GET THROUGHOUT THE YEAR BEING ORGANIZED IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00090	I HIGHLY RECOMMEND USING A PLATFORM THAT IS FREE SUCH AS GOOGLE DRIVE FOR ALL OF YOUR CALENDARS, ASSIGNMENTS, FORMS, PHOTOS, GRAPHICS, REALLY ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN THINK OF TO KEEP IT ALL IN ONE PLACE.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00091	WE PERSONALLY USE ADOBE SUITE FOR ALL OF OUR DESIGNS HOWEVER YOU CAN USE A FREE PLATFORM LIKE CANVA THAT WILL STILL ALLOW YOU TO CREATE COLOR PALETS LOGOS FONTS REALLY ALL THE SAME THINGS THAT WE DO IN ADOBE
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00092	ANY APPS THAT YOU WANT TO USE TO PLAN OUT YOUR FEED AHEAD OF TIME I WOULD RECOMMEND USING PREVIEW UNFOLD OR TEZZA
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00094	WHILE WE HAVE GIVEN YOU A LOT OF INFORMATION TODAY I JUST WANT YOU TO REMEMBER THAT WE ALL SHARE THE SAME CAUSE AND THAT THERE IS BEAUTY IN THE POWER THAT WE HAVE TO SHARE OUR PASSION WITH OTHERS.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00095	MY GREATEST RECOMMENDATION FOR YOU ALL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR MESSAGING IS ALWAYS CONSISTENT USE YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA TO GET YOUR MEMBERS FEELING VALUED AND RECOGNIZED
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00096	GET CREATIVE TO MAKE PEOPLE WANT TO ENGAGE WITH YOU AND CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO GROW ON EACH OF YOUR ACTIVE PLATFORMS.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00098	YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. WE REALLY LOVED GETTING TO SPEAK TO YOU ALL. PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CONTACT US WITH THE EMAILS LISTED BELOW IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE ANY MORE OF OUR MARKETING MATERIALS. AND AT THIS TIME WE WOULD LIKE TO OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS.

YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00008	SPECIAL THANKS FOR IBU SAFARINA FOR GIVING ME OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR LISTENING ACTIVITY.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00009	TOPIC GIVEN TO ME IS A PRELIMINARY RESEARCH ON INDONESIAN CUT MICROBIOTA RELATED WITH THE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00011	MALNUTRITION AND METABOLIC DISORDER
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00013	CONTENT OF MY PRESENTATION RELATED WITH THE MICROBIOTA OF INDONESIAN POPULATION FROM INFANT TO ELDERLY BASED ON OUR GROUP STUDY.

YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00016	INDONESIA.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00018	Before I start to the topic, I would like
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00020	TO GIVE SOME INTRODUCTION ABOUT OUR RESEARCH GROUP AT UNIVERSITAS GADJAH MADA.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00022	WE STARTED RESEARCH ON ISOLATION OF LACTIC ACID BACTERIA FROM TRADITIONAL FERMENTED FOOD AND OTHER SOURCES SINCE 1991 UP TO NOW.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00023	INDEPENDENCE IN THE FOOD AND NUTRITION CULTURE COLLECTION.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00025	IN EARLY
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00027	YEAR OF 2000
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00029	INDIGENOUS PROBIOTICS IN THE UNITED STATES. IN THE UNITED STATES. IN THE UNITED STATES. WE STARTED SCREENING OUR ISOLATES, WE STARTED SCREENING OUR ISOLATES, WHICH POTENTIAL AS A PROBIOTIC WHICH POTENTIAL AS A PROBIOTIC CANDIDATE. CANDIDATE. CURRENTLY WE HAVE SEVERAL
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00030	WE HAVE ALSO CONDUCTED HUMAN CLINICAL TRIAL ON THE HEALTH BENEFIT OF OUR INDIGENOUS PROBIOTIC WHICH INVOLVED GUT MICROBIOTA ANALYSIS
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00031	SO THAT'S WHY OUR GUT MICROBIOTA STUDY ACTUALLY START FROM THE CLINICAL TRIALS OF PROBIOTIC
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00033	SO WE ARE ALSO INVOLVED IN ASIAN MICROBIOME PROJECT LEAD BY PROF. JUAN KUNLI SINCE 2008 UP TO NOW AFTER TWO YEARS
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00034	NOW OUR UNIVERSITY STATED AS UNIVERSITY CENTER FOR EXCELLENCY FOR PROBIOTIC STUDIES
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00035	BECAUSE OUR CONSISTENT RESEARCH RELATED TO PROBIOTIC
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00037	SO
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00039	THIS PICTURE MENTIONING ABOUT
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00041	GUT MICROBIOTA FROM INFANT SCHOOL-AID CHILDREN IS THE RESULT OF IMP 1 AND 3 OR 4 I DIDN'T REMEMBER
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00042	AND ALSO CUT MICROBIOTA OF ADULT AND ELDERLY BASED ON OUR OWN STUDY
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00043	WE CAN SEE HERE IN THE PICTURE HERE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00044	PLEASE SUPPORT THE PROGRAM.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00045	PARTICULARLY IN THE PARTICULARLY IN THE PARTICULARLY IN THE PARTICULARLY IN THE PARTICULARLY IN THE PARTICULARLY IN THE PARTICULARLY IN THE PARTICULARLY IN THE PARTICULARLY IN THE PARTICULARLY IN THE PARTICULARLY IN THE PARTICULARLY IN THE PARTICULARLY IN THE PARTICULARLY IN THE PARTICULARLY IN THE PARTICULARLY IN THE PARTICULARLY IN THE PARTICULARLY IN THE PARTICULARLY IN THE PARTICULARLY IN THE PARTICULARLY IN THE PARTICULARLY IN THE PARTICULARLY IN THE PARTICULARLY IN THE PARTICULARLY IN THE PARTICULARLY IN THE PARTICULARLY IN THE PARTICULAR
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00047	FACULT MICROBIOL OF BABY AND WE CAN SEE HERE START FROM ONE MONTH, THREE MONTH, SIX MONTH, 12 MONTH AND MORE THAN 12 MONTH.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00049	INCREASED IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. WE CAN SEE HERE DOMINANCY OF
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00051	BIFIDOBACTERIUM AND ALSO BACTERIOIDES
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00053	AND THIS IS VERY MUCH DIFFERENT IF WE COMPARE TO GUT MICROBIOTA OF THE MOTHER.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00054	BUT AFTER TWO YEARS WE CAN SEE HERE THE PROFILE OF MICROBIOTA OF CHILDREN RESEMBLE TO THE MOTHER.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00055	SO WE CAN SEE HERE WE CAN CONCLUDE THAT INDONESIAN INFANT HAVE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00056	BACTEROIDIS AND BIFIDOBACTERIUM ENTEROTYPE WHILE START FROM SCHOOL AIDES AND THEN ADULT AND ELDERLY THEY HAVE PREVOTELLA ENTEROTYPE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00057	AND ACCORDING TO OUR RESEARCH FOR ELDERLY WHO LIVE IN CHUCHAKARTA AND ALSO AT THE BALI THEIR BIVIDOBACTERIUM
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00059	TEND TO DECREASE WHILE THE ENTEROBACTERIACATE TEND TO INCREASE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00061	OKAY
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00063	HERE IS A PICTURE.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00065	SEPTEMBER ENDANG WHEN WE GET THE SAMPLE FROM ELDERY AT PALI IN THE YEAR OF 2016.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00066	We must be patient interviewing the elderly here, asking about the daily diet and also health condition, including the physical activity.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00067	SUTRISWATI ENDANG SAM AKA SUTRISWATI ENDANG SAM AKA SUTRISWATI ENDANG SAM AKA SUTRISWATI ENDANG SAM AKA SUTRISWATI ENDANG SAM AKA SUTRISWATI ENDANG SAM AKA SUTRISWATI ENDANG SAM AKA SUTRISWATI ENDANG SAM AKA SUTRISWATI ENDANG SAM AKA SUTRISWATI ENDANG SAM AKA SUTRISWATI ENDANG SAM AKA SUTRISWATI ENDANG SAM AKA SUTRISWATI ENDANG SAM AKA SUTRISWATI ENDANG SAM AKA SUTRISWATI ENDANG SAM AKA SUTRISWATI ENDANG SAM AKA SUTRISWATI ENDANG SAM AKA SUTRISWATI ENDANG SAM AKA SUTRISWATI ENDANG SAM AKA SUTRISWATI ENDANG SAM AKA SUTRISW

YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00074	SO
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00076	THIS FIGURE SHOWS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GUT MICROBIOTA AND OTHER ORGANS. SUCH A BRAIN HERE.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00077	AND ALSO KIDNEY AND EVEN LUNG.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00078	WE KNOW WELL THE TERMS GUT MICROBIOTA, BRAIN EXIST SEVERAL IMPORTANT GUT MICROBIOTA METABOLITES LIKE HERE WE SEE SHORT-SIN FETIACID
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00079	AND PEPTIDE, BIOACTIVE PEPTIDE INCLUDING GABA PLAY RULE AS A NEUROTRANSMITTER
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00081	GUT MICROBIOTA ALSO SUPPORT VIA IMMUNE SYSTEM WHICH IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT GUT HEALTH HOWEVER THE BALANCE OF GUT
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00083	WHEN THE BALANCE OF GUT MICROBIOTA IS DISRUPTED BY SEVERAL FACTORS SUCH AS ANTIBIOTIC TREATMENT, FOODBORN PATHOGEN,
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00084	EVEN COVID-19 VIRUS AS WELL AS UNHEALTHY LIFE DISBIOSIS OCCURS
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00086	ACCORDING TO OUR STUDIES, THIS BIOSIS OCCURS IN MALNUTRITION OR STUNTING CHILDREN, METABOLIC DISORDER PERSON LIKE OBESITY AND DIABETIC TYPE 2,
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00087	AND NOW WE ALSO LEARN THE DIABETES BIOSIS IN NAFALDI PATIENT INCLUDING GASTROENTERITIS AOSINOPHILIC
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00088	AT THE MOMENT WE CONDUCTED THE GUT MICROBIOTA
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00090	TOTAL HIGHLIGHT OF THE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00092	OKAY
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00094	SOME OF OUR PUBLICATION IT'S IN OUR WEBSITE YEAH
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00095	PROV NAKAYAMA THIS MORNING ALSO ALREADY MENTIONED ABOUT THE CORRELATION BETWEEN CONSUMPTION OF
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00096	HIGH CARBOHYDRATE HERE RELATED WITH THE DOMINANCY OF RUMINOCOCCACEA AND ALSO BACTERIOIDES IN THE DIABETIC TYPE 2 PERSONS
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00098	WHILE CONSUMPTION OF FAT CAUSED INCREASING OF ROBOTIA RELATED
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00099	ALSO WITH PROFIT TELA THIS IS A CURSE IN THE OBESITY PERSON
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00101	This is a publication related to the AMP project.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00103	SO
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00105	WE CAN SEE HERE THIS IS A REPORT OF GOVERNMENT IN 2021 IN INDONESIA STILL FACING PROBLEM
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00106	ON A PREVALENT THIS IS A PREVALENCY OF STUNTING INDONESIA STILL FACING PROBLEM ON THIS STUNTING SOME EVEN THE COLOR IT'S A BLACK BLACK
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00107	AND IN FACT
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00108	WE SELECT ONLY TWO AREAS.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00110	FOR STUDY THE MICROBIOTA OF STUNTING OR UNDERNUTRITION THE CHILDREN AT THE JUKCEKATA HERE IN JAWA
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00111	AND ALSO AT LOMBO LOMBO IT'S REALLY RED COLOR MEAN THE IN THIS AREA UH PROBLEMS STUNTING IT'S MORE SERIOUS YEAH COMPARED TO OTHER PLACES WITH UH YELLOW OR GREEN COLOR
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00113	OKAY. THIS IS STUDY ON A GUT MICROBIOTA OF NORMAL AND UNDERNUTRITION
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00115	CHILDREN WITH THE AIDES OF 3 TO 5 YEARS. THE LOCATION OF THE SUBJECT IS FROM
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00116	THE NUMBER OF SUBJECTS ABOUT 28 CHILDREN WE CONDUCTED THIS RESEARCH DURING PANDEMIC
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00117	SO IT'S DIFFICULT FOR US TO GET MORE SUBJECT FOR THIS STUDY WE CAN SEE HERE ABOUT THE FOOD CONSUMPTION
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00118	ACTUALLY, THIS RESEARCH CONDUCTED IN THE AREA WITH SOCIAL AND ALSO ECONOMICALLY SIMILAR
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00119	SO I MEAN THE INCOME OF THE PARENTS ARE SIMILAR BUT DIFFERENT IT'S THE DIET FOR THEIR CHILDREN
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00120	WE CAN SEE HERE UNDER NUTRITION CHILDREN CONSUME SNACK AND SWEET MUCH MORE COMPARED TO THE NORMAL CHILDREN.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00121	IN HERE SEEM THAT THE SWEET AND SNACK MAYBE GIVE WHAT YOU CALL IT YEAH EFFECT TO THE REGULAR MEALS
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00122	SO THAT'S WHY MAYBE CHILDREN DOESN'T WANT TO EAT THE REGULAR MEAL BECAUSE THEY PREFER SNACK AND SWEET AND ACCORDING TO OUR DATA WE CAN SEE HERE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00124	THE DIFFERENCES OF THIS DIET GIVE ALSO THIS BIOSIS. WE CAN SEE HERE THE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00126	PROPORTION FIRMICUTE AND COMPARED TO PROPORTION OF FIRMICUTE AND BACTEROIDIS INCREASE WHILE PROTEOBACTERIA HIGHER
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00127	AND ACTINOBACTERIA LOWER
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00129	AND THIS ALSO EFFECT TO THE SHORTCHAIN FETI ACID BETWEEN THESE TWO GROUP WE CAN SEE HERE THE PROPIONIC ACID AND BUTYRIC ACID IT'S MUCH LOWER
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00130	IN THE MALNUTRITION CHILDREN WHILE THE P-8 IT'S A HIGHER HERE THE P-8 IT'S A HIGHER IN THE MALNUTRITION CHILDREN WE CAN UNDERSTAND DURING THE DISBIOSIS
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00131	WHEN THE MANY BACTERIA CHANGING IN HERE PARTICULARLY WE KNOW THAT PROTEOBACTERIA CONSISTS OF SEVERAL PATHOGENIC BACTERIA
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00132	TALKING ABOUT THE BACTERIA HERE IS LIKE THE EXAMPLE IS A BACTERIA BECOMING LOWER. WE UNDERSTAND THE SHORTENED FATTY ACID HERE IS DECREASING.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00133	IN THE MALNUTRITION CHILDREN THERE ARE ALSO OVER EXPRESSION OF METHANOPRIVYBACTER ANAROCOCUS UBACTERIUM AND ALSO SUCCINIVIBRIO SUCCINIVIBRIO WE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00134	WE HAVE PUBLISHED ALREADY THIS LAST TWO YEARS.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00135	AND THE NEXT WE COMPILED WE COMPILED FACULTURAL SAMPLES FROM UNDERNUTRITION WITH THE LOCATION AT LOMBO
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00136	WITH MORE SEVERE COMPARE TO CUKCIKATA THE AIDS CUKCIKATA WE CONDUCT CUT MICROBIOTA 3 TO 5 YEAR OLD IN LOMBOK
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00137	WE CONDUCT 9 TO 11 YEARS OLD CHILDREN HERE'S SOME PICTURE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00138	WHEN WE GIVE INFORMATION ABOUT SOME DOCUMENT MUST BE FILLED OUT LIKE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00140	INFORMED CONCERN DIAGNOSIS PATTERN THEY MUST FILL IN WE HELP THEM TO FILL IN THE DIAGNOSIS PATTERN AND ALSO THE OTHER QUESTIONNAIRE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00141	AND THEN WE GIVE THEM THE COLD BOX AND THEN THE CHILDREN
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00142	DO YOU HAVE ONE MORE MINUTE?
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00143	THE CHILDREN WILL BRING IT TO THEIR HOME AND GIVE THIS TO US IN THE MORNING THE FOLLOWING DAY
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00144	OKAY THE VERY IMPORTANT YEAH UH THIS ONE WE CAN SEE THE DETERIENT TICK IT'S REALLY LOWER FOR THE UNDERNUTRITION STUDENT UNDERNUTRITION CHILDREN
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00145	AND ALSO WE CAN SEE HERE SOME MANY FIVE AMONG SIX
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00146	ALSO DIFFERENT SIGNIFICANTLY AND HERE I CAN SEE BIFIDOBACTERIA IT'S VERY VERY LOWER IN
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00147	UNDERNUTRITION CHILDREN WHILE ACERMANCIA IS HIGHER THIS IS VERY INTERESTING
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00148	WE THINK THAT ACERMANCIA BECOMING DOMINANT BECAUSE NO NUTRITION FOR OTHER MICROORGANISMS SO THE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00149	ACARMANSIA THEY HAVE ACARMANSIA MUSINIFILA THEY HAVE MUSIN DEGRADING ENZYMES
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00150	THEY HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME DOMINANT IN THIS UNDERNUTRITION GROUP
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00151	OKAY AND SINCE OUR RESEARCH ACTUALLY RELATED WITH PROBIOTIC WE HAVE SEVERAL STUDY ON INTERVENTION OF LOCAL PROBIOTIC
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00152	AND ALSO THEIR GUT MICROBIOTA AFTER INTERVENTION ON OVERWEIGHT ADULTS AND ALSO DIABETIC WOMEN INCLUDING NAFALDI

YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00161	THANK YOU
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00002	Hi, everyone. My name is Lindsay Wilson, and I'm the executive director of Dance Marathon at Florida State University.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00003	I'M SUPER EXCITED TO BE SPEAKING WITH YOU TODAY ABOUT HOW YOU CAN LOOK AT YOUR DATA TO MAKE DATA-BASED DECISIONS DURING YOUR FUNDRAISING PUSHES.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00005	FIRST, I WANT TO GIVE A QUICK OVERVIEW OF THE TOPIC THAT WE'LL BE DISCUSSING TODAY. THE FIRST PART OF THIS PRESENTATION WILL OUTLINE IMPORTANT DATA POINTS THAT YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING AT DURING YOUR FUNDRAISING PUSHES.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00007	I'LL COVER THE IMPORTANCE OF LOOKING AT THIS DATA CRITICALLY AND EXACTLY WHAT DATA POINTS THAT YOU CAN ANALYZE. ADDITIONALLY, I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT OUR YEAR-OVER-YEAR DATA
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00008	AND HOW YOU CAN USE THIS TO MAKE DATA-BASED DECISIONS WITHIN YOUR PROGRAM, WHETHER IT'S DURING YOUR MARATHON OR WHETHER A FUNDRAISING PUSH EVENT, YOU'LL BE ABLE TO DO THAT.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00009	I'LL INCLUDE SOME EXAMPLES OF LOOKING AT THIS DATA AND HOW OUR PROGRAM AT TMI FSU FORMATS ARE TRACKING DOCUMENTS TO BEST VIEW THIS DATA.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00010	AT THE END, I ALSO HAVE AN EXAMPLE TRACKING DOCUMENT AND IF NEEDED, YOU CAN CONTACT ME FOR THAT AS WELL. THE SECOND PART OF THIS PRESENTATION WILL BE ABOUT USING THAT DATA TO MAKE DECISIONS DURING YOUR FUNDRAISING PUSHES.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00011	PROBLEMS YOU ARE SEEING OR EVEN HOW TO APPROACH THE POSITIVE DATA YOU ARE LOOKING AT.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00012	DURING THIS PART OF THE PRESENTATION, I'LL ALSO COVER DIFFERENT WAYS THAT YOU CAN IMPROVE OR INCENTIVIZE YOUR FUNDRAISING IN THE MOMENT, EVEN IF IT'S RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR MAIN EVENT.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00014	LOOKING AT YOUR DATA CAN BE EXTREMELY BENEFICIAL FOR EVERY PROGRAM BUT I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT SOMETIMES IT CAN BE EXTREMELY OVERWHELMING.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00015	HOWEVER IF YOU'RE ABLE TO SEE THIS DATA DURING YOUR FUNDRAISING INITIATIVES YOU'RE ABLE TO PINPOINT WHO'S EXCELLING AND WHO'S FALLING BEHIND SO THAT'S A HUGE BENEFIT OF LOOKING AT YOUR DATA
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00016	THIS ALLOWS YOU TO BE REALLY PROACTIVE ABOUT SOLUTIONS AND THE WAY THAT YOU RESPOND TO YOUR DATA ANALYSIS AS LONG AS YOU'RE ABLE TO PULL THIS DATA BEFOREHAND.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00018	IF YOU DO HAVE THIS DATA ACCESSIBLE BEFORE YOUR FUNDRAISING PUSHES AND YOUR PROCESS IS A LITTLE BIT MORE AUTOMATED, AS I'LL SHOW YOU IN A LITTLE BIT,
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00019	YOU MAY BE ABLE TO LOOK AT YOUR DATA TO MAKE BETTER DECISIONS ON HOW TO TARGET SPECIFIC AREAS THAT YOU MAY NEED TO IMPROVE IN FOR FUNDRAISING OR EVEN ENGAGEMENT WITHIN YOUR ORGANIZATION.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00020	SOME IMPORTANT DATA POINTS THAT WE LOOK AT SPECIFICALLY AT FSU ARE OUR ACTIVE FUNDRAISERS THAT'S BROKEN DOWN BY POSITION
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00021	POSITIONAL BREAKDOWNS IN THAT INCOME INTERNAL TEAMS YEAR OVER YEAR OUR EXTERNAL TEAMS YEAR OVER YEAR AND OUR K THROUGH 12 PROGRAMS YEAR OVER YEAR DATA I'LL GO INTO THIS A LITTLE BIT MORE INTO DETAIL WITH SOME EXAMPLES ON THE NEXT SLIDE
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00023	THESE SCREENSHOTS ARE FROM OUR TRACKING DOCUMENT THAT WE CREATED FOR OUR MAIN EFFECT LAST YEAR. THESE ARE JUST SOME EXAMPLES OF WHAT OUR DOCUMENTS LOOK LIKE TO ANALYZE OUR DATA DEPENDING ON HOW WE WANT TO LOOK AT IT.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00024	AS YOU CAN SEE AT THE TOP WE CAN INPUT A SPECIFIC TIME AND OUR NUMBERS THROUGHOUT THE DOCUMENT WILL AUTO ADJUST TO GIVE US AN IDEA OF WHERE OUR NUMBERS WERE AT COMPARED TO THE LAST FEW YEARS.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00026	WE'RE ABLE TO QUICKLY SEE THIS DATA AND COMPARE IT IN ORDER TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT AREAS WE MAY NEED TO TARGET FOR IMPROVEMENT OR AREAS THAT WE MAY NEED TO LOOK AT AND USE THAT TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS IN OTHER AREAS.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00027	THE FIRST SCREENSHOT IS OUR YEAR OVER YEAR ACTIVE FUNDRAISERS AS YOU CAN SEE OUR CORE TEAM WHICH ARE OUR COORDINATORS SHOWED AN INCREASE IN ENGAGEMENT COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS YEARS
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00028	WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO HERE IS TAKE THIS POSITIVE ASPECT OF THE DATA AND USE IT TO IMPROVE OTHER AREAS THAT MAY NOT BE SEEING AS MUCH SUCCESS.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00029	DURING OUR MAIN EVENT, WE WENT TO THIS CORE TEAM TO SEE WHAT WAS WORKING WELL FOR THEM, WHICH WE WERE ABLE TO APPLY TO A TEAM LIKE OUR CAPTAINS, AS YOU CAN SEE, WHO MAY HAVE SHOWN A LITTLE BIT OF A DECREASE IN THEIR ACTIVE FUNDRAISERS.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00030	INCOME PERCENTAGES BROKEN DOWN BY POSITION USING THIS DOCUMENT WE'RE ABLE TO USE SIMILAR TOCTICS TO SEE WHAT'S WORKING WELL IN ORDER TO TARGET DIFFERENT AREAS OF FUNDRAISING SUCH AS OUR ALUMNI.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00031	THE NEXT SCREENSHOT IS OF OUR TOTAL INTERNAL TEAM INCOME AND THIS CAN BE REALLY HELPFUL AS WE'RE ABLE TO LOOK AT THE SPECIFIC TIMES AND THAT OVERALL INCOME BROKEN DOWN BY TEAM TO SEE WHICH TEAM MAY NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A BOOST
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00032	IT LEADS US TO LOOKING AT HOW OUR ORGANIZATION MAY RESPOND BEST TO IMPLEMENTING NEW FUNDRAISING STRATEGIES IN THE MOMENT.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00034	IF YOUR PROGRAM IS ABLE TO LOOK AT THIS DATA IN THE MOMENT, YOU MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE QUICKER, MORE EFFICIENT AND SUCCESSFUL DECISIONS BASED ON HOW YOU BELIEVE THAT YOUR ORGANIZATION WILL RESPOND BECAUSE EVERY ORGANIZATION RESPONDS DIFFERENTLY.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00035	THIS COULD BE THINGS SUCH AS A COMPETITION-BASED FUNDRAISING CHALLENGE, LIVE UPDATES AND TRANSPARENCY WITH YOUR TOTALS, OR EVEN SAYING THAT IT'S YOUR DANCER'S LAST CHANCE TO REACH THEIR GOAL.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00036	THE PURPOSE OF LOOKING AT THIS DATA IN DETAIL HERE THOUGH IS TO NOT BE AFRAID TO MAKE CHANGES WHILE IT'S HAPPENING.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00037	AND LEARNING THAT IT'S OKAY TO IMPLEMENT A BRAND NEW FUNDRAISING PUSH IN A MOMENT DURING YOUR MARATHON, WHICH IS HOW WE STUMBLED ACROSS SOME SOLUTIONS THAT WE'VE CREATED, SUCH AS FUNDRAISING FACE-OFF.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00039	FACEOFF BEGAN ORIGINALLY AS AN INTERNAL TEAM ONLY TRADITION
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00040	ON PUSH DAYS WHERE ALL OF OUR INTERNAL TEAMS COMPETED IN A BRACKET STYLE COMPETITION WE REALLY HAVE AN OVERWHELMINGLY POSITIVE RESPONSE TO THIS INITIATIVE SO MUCH THAT WE WERE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THIS WITH OUR ORGANIZATIONAL TEAMS AS WELL
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00042	IT REALLY HELPED TO PROMOTE A FRIENDLY COMPETITIVE ATMOSPHERE TO ENCOURAGE THAT POSITIVE FUNDRAISING MINDSET
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00044	THE CHAIRS AND THEIR DELEGATES WITHIN THESE ORGANIZATIONS COULD ALSO ENCOURAGE THEIR MEMBERS TO PARTICIPATE INCENTIVIZING IT IN DIFFERENT WAYS DEPENDING ON HOW THEY BELIEVE THEIR ORGANIZATION WILL RESPOND
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00046	SUCH AS ENCOURAGING THEM TO HIT THEIR TEAM GOAL OR EVEN REACHING AN INCENTIVE THAT THE CHAIR OR DELEGATE WAS GOING TO GIVE THEM DURING OUR MAIN EVENT WE WERE ABLE TO BROADCAST THIS IMAGE ON OUR SCREENS TO SHOW LIVE PROGRESS AND UPDATES
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00047	THE TEAMS WERE ABLE TO SEE THEIR PROGRESS LIVE ON THESE SCREENS DURING OUR EVENT.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00048	THE FUNDRAISING PUSH. THIS IS ONE WAY WE WERE ABLE TO SEE OUR DATA, LOOK AT IT, OKAY, MAYBE WE NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE IMPROVEMENT.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00049	IN THE FUNDRAISING AREAS OF OUR TEAMS SO THEREFORE WE WERE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THINGS SUCH AS FUNDRAISING FACE OFF
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00051	SO POWER HOUR IS ANOTHER WAY THAT OUR PROGRAM AT FSU IMPLEMENTS TO KIND OF INCREASE FUNDRAISING WHEN IT'S NEEDED AFTER WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT DATA. SO DURING POWER HOUR THIS HOUR IS SOLELY DEDICATED TO FUNDRAISING
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00052	HOWEVER, YOU CAN SET WHATEVER GOAL YOU WANT, WHATEVER THAT LOOKS LIKE FOR YOUR PROGRAM OR WHAT YOU THINK MAY WORK BEST.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00053	FOR EXAMPLE WE USE HIT YOUR NEXT DOUBLE ZERO WHICH COULD MEAN GOING FROM $562 TO $600 DURING THIS HOUR.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00055	ANOTHER GOAL FOR POWER HOUR COULD BE TO REACH THEIR GOAL FOR THE PUSH OR FOR THE MARATHON OR EVEN HITTING THAT PERSONAL OR TEAM GOAL THAT THEY'D SET THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00057	WE WERE ABLE TO DISPLAY OUR INCREASING TOTAL LIVE DURING POWER HOUR ON THE SCREENS. THEY WERE UPDATED LIVE IN EVENT AS OUR MCS HOSTED THE WHOLE HOUR INCLUDING TEAM AND FUNDRAISER SHOUTOUTS TO THOSE WHO HIT THAT NEXT DOUBLE ZERO MILESTONE.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00058	THIS DOCUMENT SCREEN SHOT ON THE BOTTOM IS FROM A LIST OF NAMES WE PULLED FROM A REPORT THAT INDICATED IF THEY HIT THAT NEXT DOUBLE ZERO, IF THEY WERE ANNOUNCED BY THE MCS, AND IF THEY HIT IT AGAIN DURING THE HOUR.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00059	THIS LIVE RECOGNITION REALLY RECOGNIZES THEM FOR THEIR HARD WORK AND WE WERE ALSO ABLE TO CONTINUOUSLY INTEGRATE OUR MORALE TEAM FOR ENCOURAGEMENT AND HYPE TO MAKE THIS HOUR SUPER EXCITING AND ENGAGING.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00060	SO POWER HOUR CAN BE ONE WAY TO KIND OF INCREASE THAT ENGAGEMENT AS WELL AS FUNDRAISING BRING BACK THAT COMMUNITY ASPECT TO FUNDRAISING AND FOSTER THAT POSITIVE FUNDRAISING MINDSET AS WELL
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00062	THIS YEAR WE REALLY BEGAN TO FOCUS MORE ON VENMO INTEGRATION WE REALLY WANTED OUR MEMBERS TO DONATE DIRECTLY FROM VENMO TO DONOR THROUGH DONOR DRIVE IN ORDER TO DISCOURAGE THEM FROM HOLDING THOSE VENMO BALANCES IN THEIR PERSONAL VENMO ACCOUNTS
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00063	WE REALLY HIGHLIGHTED DONATING DIRECTLY USING THIS VENMO TRANSACTION FEATURE IN DONOR DRIVE WHICH REALLY HELPED US TO ALSO SEE MORE REALISTIC NUMBERS IN OUR DATA WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT THAT DATA
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00064	INFRAMONEY ACTUALLY GETTING PUT INTO THOSE ACCOUNTS AND NOT JUST SITTING IN THOSE MENMO ACCOUNTS.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00065	THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS WE WERE ABLE TO PROMOTE THE USE OF THIS THOUGH. AND WE WERE ABLE TO GET CREATIVE BASED ON THE AREAS WE NEEDED TO SEE A LITTLE BIT MORE INCREASE IN.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00066	ONE WAY WE DID THIS WAS BY SAYING THAT EVERY 10TH VENMO DONATION IN THE NEXT HOUR WOULD BE MATCHED. TO DO THIS, WE PULLED A REPORT, FILTERED FOR VENMO DONATIONS, AND THEN WENT THROUGH EVERY 10TH ONE TO SEE WHICH ONE WOULD BE MATCHED.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00067	ANOTHER WAY YOU MAY BE ABLE TO PROMOTE THE USE OF THIS FEATURE IS BY SAYING THAT TEAM WITH THE MOST TRANSACTIONS IN THE NEXT HOUR WINS SOME INCENTIVE THAT YOU SET FROM YOUR ORGANIZATION.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00069	AGAIN, YOU CAN DO THIS BY PULLING A REPORT TO SEE THOSE VENOMO TRANSACTIONS AND LOOKING AT IT THAT WAY.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00071	LASTLY YOU CAN REALLY PROMOTE THE USE OF INTO GRATION FEATURE BY CREATING A MAIN PAGE FOR FEES AND TICKETS AND PROMOTING DONATING VIA IN THAT WAY.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00072	WE TARGETED THIS FEATURE WHEN IT SEEMS LIKE STUDENTS MAY BE HOLDING THEIR VENOMO BALANCES OR OTHER TACTICS WEREN'T SHOWING AS MUCH SUCCESS. IT WAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT OUR PARTICIPANTS HADN'T SEEN BEFORE THIS YEAR AND ENDED UP SEEING A LOT OF SUCCESS FROM IT.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00074	NEXT ONE OF MY FAVORITE WAYS TO RESPOND TO THOSE AREAS YOU MAY NEED TO IMPROVE IN AFTER LOOKING AT YOUR DATA IS BY IMPLEMENTING A FINAL FUNDRAISING PUSH WITHIN YOUR PUSH OR EVEN YOUR MAIN EVENT.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00075	SO THIS LAST YEAR AT OUR MARATHON, OUR FUNDRAISING DEVELOPMENT TEAM KIND OF CREATED A THEME FOR FUNDRAISING FOR OUR MARATHON, WHICH WAS LEGOS.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00077	SO WE NAMED OUR FINAL FUNDRAISING PUSH BUILDING OUR LEGACY AND REALLY THE GOAL OF THIS PUSH WAS TO HIT YOUR OVERALL FUNDRAISING GOAL WHETHER THAT WAS A TEAM OR PERSONAL GOAL DURING THE VERY LAST HOUR OF THE EVENT.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00078	SUCCESSFULLY ENCOURAGED DANCERS TO REACH FINAL DOLLARS BEFORE THE END OF SHIFT AND GET ALL FUNDRAISING IN BEFORE THE YEAR WAS OVER.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00080	THIS GRAPHIC THAT'S ON THE SLIDES WAS DISPLAYED LIVE ON THE SCREENS AS WELL WHICH SHOWED INCREASING LEGO BLOCKS AS THE LAST HOUR UNFOLDED.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00081	FUNDRAISING INITIATIVES IN EVENTS SUCH AS THESE FINAL PUSHES REALLY EMPHASIZE HOW YOU CAN TRULY MAKE DECISIONS IN REAL TIME BY LOOKING AT YOUR DATA.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00082	THROUGH ALL OF THESE INITIATIVES WE WERE ABLE TO INCORPORATE BOTH ENGAGEMENT AND FUNDRAISING STRATEGIES TO KIND OF BUILD AND FOSTER THAT POSITIVE FUNDRAISING MINDSET THAT SOMETIMES YOU SEE LACKING DURING THOSE BIG FUNDRAISING PUSHES OR DURING THE MARATHON EVENT
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00083	SO THROUGH THESE THINGS YOU'RE NOT ONLY ABLE TO INCREASE FUNDRAISING AFTER LOOKING AT THE DATA AND AREAS YOU MAY NEED IMPROVEMENT BUT YOU'RE ALSO ABLE TO ENGAGE YOUR MEMBERS IN A NEW EXCITING WAY
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00084	THAT KIND OF BUILDS A MORE POSITIVE MINDSET AROUND THE ORGANIZATION AND AROUND THE FUNDRAISING ASPECT OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00086	BEING OPEN TO ADJUSTING AND BEING CREATIVE DURING YOUR EVENT WILL REALLY ALLOW YOU TO MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS FOR YOUR PROGRAM.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00087	AND TO TARGET THOSE AREAS YOU MAY NEED TO SEE MORE SUCCESS IN OR YOU MAY WANT TO SEE MORE SUCCESS IN WITH FUNDRAISING.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00088	AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT'S TRULY ALL ABOUT BEING READY TO MAKE CHANGES, BEING ADAPTABLE, AND REALLY GIVING YOUR PARTICIPANTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO FUNDRAISE CREATIVELY AND HAVE FUN WHILE DOING IT.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00089	BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY, ALL WE WANT TO DO IS FOSTER THAT POSITIVE FUNDRAISING MINDSET AND DRAW THAT CAUSE CONNECTION BACK TO THE ORGANIZATION AND HELP OUR PARTICIPANTS REALIZE WHY THEY'RE FUNDRAISING AND WHY THEY'RE DOING THIS AT THE END OF THE DAY.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00091	THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR LISTENING TODAY PLEASE DON'T HESITATE TO REACH OUT IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT LOOKING AT YOUR DATA HOW TO IMPLEMENT THESE STRATEGIES INTO YOUR PROGRAM BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WHATEVER WORKS BEST FOR YOUR PROGRAM WORKS ALL PROGRAMS ARE DIFFERENT
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00092	BUT REALLY INCORPORATING THOSE ENGAGEMENT STRATEGIES AND FUNDRAISING STRATEGIES IN ORDER TO BUILD THAT CAUSE CONNECTION TRUST WITHIN YOUR ORGANIZATION
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00093	AND THAT POSITIVE FUNDRAISING MINDSET IS REALLY WHAT WILL HELP YOU BEST RESPOND TO YOUR DATA IN THE MOMENT WHEN YOU NEED IT THE MOST. THANK YOU ALL.

YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00009	I mean we currently have an award for our miracle maker award that means that like we have uh we've been in an organization for like between 10 to 14 years and we got that award and we're number seven in the nation for the amount we have raised for capital
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00011	So what is Registration Push Day? Registration Push Day is a day that we set at the beginning of the school year. It's our first event and we try to get as many participants sign up during that day.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00013	SOME STRATEGIES WE USE IS SENDING OUT EMAILS TO LAPSEN PARTICIPANTS AT MIDNIGHT.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00014	SO HOW WE DO THIS IS WE GET OUR LIST FROM LAST YEAR THAT WERE IN DANCE MARATHON AND WE SENT IT TO THEM AND THEN FOR OUR FIRST YEARS TO GET THEM INVOLVED
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00015	EMAILS SENDING RECRUIT DAY CODES REGISTER THINK MIDNIGHT SET LINK HOUR FAIR YEARS SENT SOCCES BIGGER 51555 PICTURE
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00016	WE ALSO IN OUR EMAILS SEND OUT LINKS TO THEM ON THAT TOO WE DO A PROMO CODE USUALLY IT'S LIKE FIVE DOLLARS OFF THAT DAY
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00017	WE ALSO CAN TEXT TO 51555 TO REGISTER WE TRY TO SET GOALS THINK OF BIGGER PICTURES AND BREAK DOWN STRATEGIES WE USUALLY DO A POWER HOUR
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00018	SENDING DAY CODES RECRUIT REGISTERED TO THE HOUR OF THE EXECUTIVE TEAM RECRUITING THE WHOLE DAY
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00020	WHAT IS THE KEY TO OUR SUCCESSFUL REGISTRATION PUSH DAY? IT'S OUR MORALE CAPTAINS. OUR MORALE CAPTAINS ARE BASICALLY THE SIR OF THE SHOWS. THEY HELP RUN EVERYTHING.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00021	THERE'S USUALLY A COMPETITION BETWEEN OUR MORALE CAPTAINS.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00022	PARTICIPANTS HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGHER HIGH
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00023	OUT QR CODES MAKE SURE THEY SIGN UP FOR THEIR TEAM
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00024	USUALLY THAT WE HAVE LIKE MORALE CAPTAINS HAVE LIKE A SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF A GOAL FOR HOW MANY PEOPLE THEY WANT ON EACH ON THEIR TEAM.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00025	PROMO CODE
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00026	GETTING THEM EXCITED FOR IT AND GIVING THEM THE RESOURCES TO SUCCEED. IF YOU DON'T HAVE MORALE CAPTAINS, OUR CLOSEST PROBABLY THING WOULD BE HAVING AN EXEC TEAM
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00027	PARTICIPANTS CHILDREN'S MARATHON PROMO PARTICIPANTS CHILDREN'S MARATHON PROMO PARTICIPANTS CHILDREN'S MARATHON PROMO PARTICIPANTS CHILDREN'S MARATHON PROMO PARTICIPANTS CHILDREN'S MARATHON PROMO PARTICIPANTS CHILDREN'S MARATHON PROMO PARTICIPANTS CHILDREN'S MARATHON PROMO PARTICIPANTS CHILDREN'S MARATHON PROMO PARTICIPANTS CHILDREN'S MARATHON PROMO PARTICIPANTS CHILDREN'S MARATHON PROMO PARTICIPANTS CHILDREN'S MARATHON PROMO PARTICIPANTS CHILDREN'S MARATHON PROMO PARTICIPANTS CHILDREN'S MARATHON PROMO PARTIC
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00029	SO WHAT IS THE REASON TO JOIN? WELL, THERE'S ALWAYS SO MANY DIFFERENT REASONS TO JOIN, BUT SOME THREE BIG ONES IS A SOCIAL CAUSE, CAUSE CONNECTION, ACADEMIC OR PROFESSIONAL RESUME BUILDER FOR LEADERSHIP AND EXPERIENCE.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00030	CAUSE CONNECTION IN HIGH SCHOOL WE HAD A STUDENT IN MY GRADE THAT HAD LEUKEMIA CANCER AND WE ALWAYS TRIED TO FUNDRAISE
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00031	I ALWAYS WANTED TO CONTINUE SOMEHOW TO FUNDRAISE FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA STEED FAMILY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00033	DOES THIS WORK IT WORKS YES IT DOES SO WE STARTED THIS ABOUT IN THE FALL OF 2020
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00034	THAT'S KIND OF WHEN WE DECIDED, HEY, LET'S DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO REGISTER AND GET AS MANY PEOPLE AS WE CAN FOR MORE TO JOIN THIS ORGANIZATION.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00035	SO IN 2020 2021 WE RECRUITED 252 PARTICIPANTS AND WE HAD 340 OVERALL
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00036	AND THEN IN 2021 AND 2022 WE RECRUITED 300 PARTICIPANTS ON THAT DAY AND HAD ONLY 371 TOTAL.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00037	SO OUR REGISTRATION FIRST DAY IS OUR FIRST EVENT OF THE YEAR. SO BASICALLY WE'RE NOT FUNDRAISING AT ALL ANY MONEY OR ANYTHING FOR OUR DONOR DRIVES. WE'RE JUST SOLELY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET THE MOST PEOPLE INVOLVED.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00038	WITH OUR ORGANIZATION ON CAMPUS AND IT IS A SURPRISE
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00039	AND ONLY THE EXECUTIVE TEAM KNOWS SO IT'S KIND OF LIKE A SPUR OF THE MOMENT OH THERE'S THIS INVOLVEMENT FAIR WE CAN SIGN UP THERE OR OH WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE A BIG PARTY ON CAMPUS LAWN THAT KIND OF STUFF
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00041	HOW DOES IT HELP MY PROGRAM? OUR FUNDRAISING IMPROVED TREMENDOUSLY. CHILDREN'S HEALTH DAY 2019 WE ONLY FUNDRAISED $1700.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00042	DAY CHILDREN'S HEALTH DAY 2020 FUNDRAISED $6751.29 SECOND IN IOWA FUNDRAISING 22ND IN NATION FUNDRAISING SECOND IN OUR TIER
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00043	CHILDREN'S HEALTH DAY 2021 8500 WEEK FUNDRAISE 1500
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00045	SO SOME OTHER THINGS THAT WE ALSO USE ARE THESE GRAPHICS. SO ON THE LEFT WE HAVE A QR CODE. WE HAVE THIS POSTED ON OUR SOCIAL MEDIA A LOT.

YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00009	AND SO THE IDEA OF THE WORKSHOP ITSELF IS TO DISCUSS HOW TO USE YOUR CAREER MORE EFFECTIVELY AND TO ESSENTIALLY HELP MORE ANIMALS THROUGH OUR CAREER.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00010	AND IN ORDER THAT WE DO THIS, IT'S ACTUALLY VITAL TO SPEND SOME TIME ACTUALLY PLANNING THIS. AND THERE'S TWO REASONS FOR THIS. THE FIRST ONE IS BECAUSE NOT ALL ULTRASTIC ACTIONS ARE EQUAL.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00011	AND THE SECONDLY IS THAT SOMETIME THINKING OR PLANNING COULD ACTUALLY MULTIPLY THE IMPACT YOU HAVE BY UP TO 10 TO 100 TIMES WHICH IS QUITE A LOT.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00012	SUMMARY OF WHAT THE SESSION WILL ENTAIL.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00013	I WILL BE DOING A 20 MINUTE PRESENTATION GOING THROUGH DIFFERENT STEPS OF THE CAREER DECISION MAKING PROCESS AND OUTLINING AVAILABLE RESOURCES WHICH YOU CAN LOOK INTO IN MORE DETAIL AFTER THE PRESENTATION.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00014	UNCERTAINTIES SPECIFIC AREAS YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00015	RESOURCES YOU CAN TAKE AWAY AND DO MORE PLANNING. THEN YOU'RE GOING TO JOIN A GROUP
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00016	INSTRUCTIONS AND FINISH WITH A Q&A SESSION.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00018	THEIR POTENTIAL AND THEIR POSITIVE IMPACT FOR ANIMALS.

YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00020	ANIMALS. ONE OF THE WAYS WE ARE MOST EXCITED THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN MAKE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT FOR ANIMALS IS THROUGH UTILIZING OUR CAREER.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00021	IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED THROUGH RESEARCH THAT MOST INDIVIDUALS SPEND APPROXIMATELY 80,000 HOURS OF THEIR TIME
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00022	AND THEIR LIVES IN A CAREER. SO IT KIND OF MAKES SENSE AND A KEY FACTOR WHERE INDIVIDUALS CAN MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE TO ANIMALS WOULD BE TO UTILIZE THEIR CAREER TO HELP AS MANY ANIMALS AS POSSIBLE.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00023	AND WITH SUCH A BIG OPPORTUNITY AT STAKE, IT'S ARGUABLY OUR DUTY TO SPEND SOME REAL TIME THINKING THROUGH OUR OPPORTUNITIES AND THINKING THROUGH A CONCRETE STRATEGY OF HOW WE CAN HELP ACTUAL INDIVIDUAL ANIMALS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00024	AND THROUGH OUR CAREERS. IT MIGHT SEEM A LITTLE BORING. SOME PEOPLE MIGHT THINK IT'S OVERWHELMING AND SLIGHTLY MELODRAMATIC. BUT IF WE ACTUALLY TAKE THROUGH A SCENARIO WHERE WE MAYBE WOULD HAVE TWO JOB OPPORTUNITIES, I THINK WE CAN MAYBE

YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00027	SO AS YOU CAN SEE, THERE CAN BE VERY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES TO YOU BEING ABLE TO MAKE AN IMPACT JUST THROUGH A SMALL CHOICE THAT YOU WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00028	AND SO ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS THAT THERE'S DISPARITY BETWEEN OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDIVIDUAL IMPACT AND WE ALSO HAVE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00029	SO IT MAKES SENSE THAT WE TRY AND THINK THROUGH OPTIONS AND PRIORITIZE THEM ALL ACCORDINGLY SO THAT WE CAN ASSESS OPPORTUNITIES WHEN THEY ARRIVE.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00031	So where do we begin with this? Most of this is lifted from an excellent article on ETK's website, which I would recommend to everybody.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00032	CLARIFY LAUR WHICH IS CALLED HOW TO MAKE TOUGH CAREER WHICH IS CALLED HOW TO MAKE TOUGH CAREER WHICH IS CALLED HOW TO MAKE TOUGH CAREER OPTIONS. OPTIONS. OPTIONS.

YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00033	DECISION LAUR MEE CLARIFY FOR FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES AND ALSO PLAN OUT OUR STRATEGY TO MAXIMIZE OUR IMPACT. SO STEP ONE IS TO CLARIFY THE DECISION THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO

YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00035	SO FOR IT MIGHT BE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL THAT YOU MIGHT BE CHOOSING BETWEEN TWO CONCRETE JOB OPPORTUNITIES.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00036	SOME PEOPLE MIGHT BE WANTING TO DO LONG-TERM CAREER STRATEGY
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00037	BUT FOR THE SAKE OF THIS WORKSHOP AND THE WIDEST APPLICABILITY, WE'RE GOING TO CONSIDER COMING UP WITH MORE OF OUR MEDIUM TERM OPTIONS.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00039	SO IF WE'RE TAKING MEDIUM TERM, THEN WE START TO THINK ABOUT WHAT ARE OUR MOST IMPORTANT PRIORITIES FOR THIS.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00040	IMPORTANT MEE LAUR POTENTIAL IMPORTANT MEE LAUR POTENTIAL SO THIS WILL OBVIOUSLY BE QUITE SO THIS WILL OBVIOUSLY BE QUITE SO THIS WILL OBVIOUSLY BE QUITE INDIVIDUAL AND IT WILL BE VERY INDIVIDUAL AND IT WILL BE VERY INDIVIDUAL AND IT WILL BE VERY UNIQUE TO SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS ON UNIQUE TO SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS ON UNIQUE TO SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS ON THEIR PRIORITIES THEIR PRIORITIES

YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00042	IMPACT POTENTIAL PERSONAL FIT CAREER CAPITAL OPTION VALUE VALUE OF INFORMATION
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00043	IMPORTANT RELATIONS AND I'M GOING TO GO THROUGH EACH OF THESE IN SLIGHTLY MORE DETAIL TO TRY AND REMOVE THE JARGON AND ALSO TO GIVE YOU ALL SOME RESOURCES SO THAT YOU CAN LOOK THEM UP INDIVIDUALLY AFTERWARDS.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00045	So the first and arguably the most important is actually impact potential. So how much impact potential do you have with each of the job opportunities that you're considering?
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00047	This is perhaps one of the most important parts of it. An excellent guide for this is the Centre for Effective Altruism's resources page, which goes through this in a lot more detail.

YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00051	THEY ALSO HAVE CHARITY REVIEWS AND INTERVENTION REVIEWS AS WELL BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S NOT JUST THE FACT THAT YOU BE CONSIDERING CAUSE PRIORITIZATION
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00052	BUT YOU ALSO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT SPECIFICALLY WHAT KIND OF ROLE THAT YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY BE THINKING ABOUT OR CONSIDERING AND HOW MUCH IMPACT POTENTIAL THAT ROLE HAS AS WELL.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00054	PERSONAL FIT PERSONAL SATISFACTION CAREER CAPITAL OPTION VALUE AND VALUE OF INFORMATION
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00055	I've bucketed a lot into this one section, but the reason is because a lot of the resources that are available on this are very similar.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00056	SO WE'VE GOT 80,000 HOURS CAREER VIEWS WHICH GOES THROUGH THIS IN A LOT MORE DETAIL SOME OF THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE AT AAC LIKE THE SKILLS PROFILES
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00057	WE'LL GO THROUGH AND INCLUDE SOME TIPS FOR THINGS LIKE PERSONAL FIT AND WE ALSO HAVE A GLOSSARY OF TERMS TO GO THROUGH THESE IN MORE DETAIL.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00058	ASSESSING PROFILES FIT RENT HOURS CAPIT PERSONAL GLOSSARY VALUE OPTION INFORMATION INCLUDING MEE TERMS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00060	SO THERE'S SOME INDIVIDUAL RESEARCH YOU CAN DO AS WELL, WHICH IS MOSTLY JUST GOOGLING, LOOKING THROUGH RESOURCES. BUT ANOTHER REALLY GOOD WAY TO ACTUALLY FIND OUT SOME MORE INFORMATION IS TO ASK INDIVIDUALS THAT YOU MIGHT KNOW ALREADY.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00061	SO WHEN YOU HAVE SOME JOB OPPORTUNITIES THAT YOU MIGHT BE THINKING ABOUT TO GO THROUGH THESE DIFFERENT METRICS AND ASK INDIVIDUALS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00062	WHAT THEY THINK THE CAREER CAPITAL OPPORTUNITIES ARE, THE OPTION VALUE OR THE VALUE OF INFORMATION.

YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00067	COMMUNITY CAPITAL SO HOW DO WE AS AN INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTE TO THE WIDER COMMUNITY BY THE ROLE THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY TAKING?
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00068	AND THESE ARE QUITE IMPORTANT ASPECTS AND CAN REALLY SHIFT HOW MUCH IMPACT ONE COULD HAVE FROM TWO OPPORTUNITIES THAT YOU MIGHT BE CONSIDERING.

YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00071	SO BOTH OF THESE WERE CONDUCTED TO HELP INDIVIDUALS UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THIS. THERE'S SOME VARIOUS LIMITATIONS TO SPOT CHECK WHICH MY COFOUNDER JAMIE CONDUCTED.

YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00074	SOME NOTABLE POINTS WHICH MIGHT BE WORTH CONSIDERING WAS THAT BOTH FUNDRAISING AND OPERATIONS ROLES WERE OVERREPRESENTED IN THE ADVERTISED JOB OPPORTUNITIES COMPARED TO THE CURRENT ROLES.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00075	THIS SUGGESTS THAT FILLING ROLES IS DIFFICULT FOR EFFECTIVE ANIMAL ADVOCACY NONPROFITS.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00076	AND PROVIDES WEAK EVIDENCE THAT OPERATIONS EXPERTISE IS A BOTTLENECK FOR EFFECTIVE ANIMAL ADVOCACY NONPROFITS.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00077	CAMPAIGN ROLES AND RESEARCH ROLES WERE BOTH SLIGHTLY UNDERREPRESENTED IN JOB ADS.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00078	THIS MATCHES OUR IMPRESSION THAT THESE ROLES ARE GENERALLY POPULAR AND OVERSUBSCRIBED IN THE JOB SPECIFICATIONS FOR ADVERTISED JOB ROLES COMMUNICATION SKILLS AND ENGLISH LANGUAGE WERE FREQUENTLY REQUESTED AS IMPORTANT
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00079	AND REMOTE WORK WAS COMMON BUT FLEXIBILITY BY COUNTRY OF RESIDENCY WAS NOT.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00080	MOST JOBS REQUIRE EXPERIENCE IN RELATED TYPES OF ROLES SO THE AVERAGE FOR THIS WAS ABOUT 1.8 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WAS REQUIRED IN EACH ONE OF THESE JOB ROLES.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00082	SO THE SECOND THING WE DID WAS CONDUCT THE THIS TIME LAST YEAR ACTUALLY 12 CEOs AND HIRING PROFESSIONALS FROM NINE OF THE TEN STANDOUT CHARITIES CURRENTLY LISTED ON ANIMAL CHARITY EVALUATORS PAGE

YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00084	AS YOU CAN SEE OVERWHELMINGLY FUNDRAISING AND UNSURPRISINGLY FUNDING WAS THE MAJOR BOTTLENECK FOR ORGANISATIONS

YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00093	AND THESE TERMS ARE ON OUR WEBSITE. SO YOU HAVE THOSE TWO WHICH I HAVE JUST DISCUSSED WITH YOU. AGAIN, I WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO ASK INDIVIDUALS THAT YOU MIGHT KNOW

YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00099	Okay, so I've talked quite a lot now. And now my screen has decided to do that. So I'm really sorry about that. So the next part of the presentation is that we want to generate some more options.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00100	SO THE IDEA NOW IS THAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH STEP ONE, WHICH IS TO CLARIFY OUR DECISION. WE'VE GONE THROUGH STEP TWO, WHICH IS TO THINK ABOUT OUR KEY PRIORITIES.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00101	AND OUR THIRD STEP WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT IS TO GENERATE SOME OPTIONS. I KNOW PEOPLE ARE USUALLY QUITE RELUCTANT TO DO THIS AND THEY WILL USUALLY COME UP WITH ONE OR TWO BUT I WANT TO TRY AND ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY TO THINK OF AS MANY OPTIONS AS THEY CAN.

YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00108	THINKING ABOUT DIFFERENT OPTIONS AND THEN WE WILL GO ON TO THE NEXT STAGE. I'M GOING TO PAUSE FOR A SECOND. EVERYONE THINK ABOUT YOUR OPTIONS.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00111	I'M ALSO GOING TO PUT UP SOME TIPS ON THE NEXT SCREEN TO HELP YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR OPTIONS.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00113	AVAILABLE IN THE WORLD.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00115	OKAY. SO OBVIOUSLY THAT WASN'T ENOUGH TIME FOR YOU ALL TO GENERATE AS MANY OPTIONS AS IS POSSIBLE FOR EACH OF YOU BUT HOPEFULLY IT'S GIVEN YOU SOME INSPIRATION OR AT LEAST STARTED TO MAKE YOU THINK ABOUT MORE OPTIONS THAT ARE POTENTIAL FOR YOU.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00116	SO AFTER THIS THE NEXT STEP THAT WE WANT TO TAKE IS RANKING THESE OPTIONS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00117	I'LL SHARE THESE SLIDES ON THE FACEBOOK GROUP AFTERWARDS SO YOU CAN ALL SPEND SOME REAL TIME THINKING ABOUT THEM BUT THE IDEA IS TO TRY AND GET YOU

YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00134	Welcome back. So sorry for the mess-up, Lorin. It was not as easy as I thought. I could not get all the information in the broadcast, so it took me some time to figure it out. But I hope it was delivered.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00135	Yeah, well, I hope it was as useful as I got to speak to someone and she was quite fantastic. So I hope that everyone else had a good time.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00136	Can I just check that, can you see my screen or not? Because I'm not 100% sure at this point.

YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00140	We're just going to move over to the Q&A session. And I just wanted to say before we did that,
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00141	that hopefully people have found the workshop really useful and
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00142	or marginally useful and got something out of it. I just wanted to say that we do have more resources available on our website. And we also have two things that people can do following this.

YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00147	REN MEE REN
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00149	Great. Thank you, Lauren. So now we can open Q&A session. We have 12 minutes, or almost 12 minutes. I would like to remind you to not ask the question directly. Keep your mic muted.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00150	and post your questions to Slido. You should find the link to Slido in the chat and it will be put there again in a few moments.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00151	And we already have two questions there. So let's start with the first question. Hi, is it possible to work as an independent researcher within EAA?
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00152	HUMANNY
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00154	I'm really sorry. Could you repeat the question? I promise.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00155	Okay, sorry about that. So, is it possible to work as an independent researcher within the effective animal advocacy?
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00156	That means applying for funding to do research projects as an individual rather than with an organization.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00158	Yeah, I think that that would definitely be a potential option. I think that there are some funding resources available for individual projects. I think it would really
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00159	REN MEE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00160	particularly on priority areas. I think the effect of animal, the effect of altruism
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00161	Community does usually fund these things. I've heard of people doing that. I hope that answers the question, but if you have a follow-up, feel free to ask.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00163	Okay, next question from Haven. What was your career path before launching this new cool organization?
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00164	Thanks, even. Yeah, so my career path before before this is I worked in the for profit world for almost 10 years before I did this.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00165	and I worked as a client manager and then ended up in consultancy. And when I was doing that, I was also volunteering.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00166	for effective animal advocacy organizations like the Humane League and the Good Food Institute and I really enjoyed that work that was potentially the most exciting part of my job even though it wasn't my job
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00167	and that inspired me to start charity entrepreneurship, which I think you were also on. And then I started this organization.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00169	Thank you. The next question is from Ula Zarosa. Who would benefit the most from the individual calls that AAC is providing?
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00171	REN MEE REN
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00172	REN MEE REN
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00173	The actual application form itself is quite long. Sorry about that, but it is there to try and help to get people to really think about their career.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00174	And it would be beneficial, I think, for anybody who is uncertain about any aspect of their career and would just like to speak a little bit more about it.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00175	and we can give you feedback on it and hopefully give you some more tailored and individual resources to help you with your career decision making.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00177	Thank you. Next question is from Matilda Daruy. I apologize if I mispronounced that. Do you have any pointers on how to go about assessing relative fit?
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00179	Oh, assessing relative fit. Yeah, I mean, I think that really, I think that one of the most important things to do in assessing your relative
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00180	REN MEE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00181	REN MEE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00182	But it can be quite useful to actually ask people that you know to give you feedback so that you can really get a better
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00183	um objective uh view of your specific skill sets um and then you can quite accurately probably assess your relative fit another thing that you can do is do some volunteering
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00184	REN MEE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00185	I didn't it didn't fit very well with me so I'm really glad I'm very grateful for my co-founder Jamie who does the more arduous side of research because I know that that would not have been
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00186	A very good fit for me. And prior to that, I thought I would have been a fantastic researcher. So volunteering can be very helpful for that.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00188	Thank you. I would like to remind others that in Slido you can vote for the questions you find most interesting. It is the preferred way of doing this because we have several questions and only seven minutes left.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00189	So we won't be able to go through all of them. The next question is, if you want to work in a plant-based campaigning on institutional level,
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00190	What kind of university degree would be useful or what skills would be useful to learn?
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00192	Yeah, that's a really good question and very specific. I don't think that I would be the best person to ask that for because I don't have that background. So for me to kind of like answer that question would probably be misdirected.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00193	I think that if you were to use the community directory, which I think I referenced before, there will probably be somebody who actually specifically works in that space.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00194	and can probably tell you about their career trajectory and how they got there and which ones are more useful than other ones.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00196	if that's okay as an answer.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00198	OK, thank you. Let's get to the next one. Do you have any tips for how to cheaply explore social scientific research related to effective animal advocacy and alternative protein startups?
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00200	Again, that's a very specific question. I don't really have an answer for that. I'm really sorry. But I think like the general thing would be that if you have a really, really specific question about a particular career,
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00201	REN MEE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00202	We have only researched into a specific area at the moment and overall career strategy and very specific questions would probably be better directed
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00203	who has significantly more experience in a specific role.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00205	OK, thank you. Next question. How lengthy is the process involved in applying for individual career counseling goals?
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00207	Sorry, could you just repeat that?
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00208	How lengthy is the process involved in applying for individual career counseling goals?
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00209	Yeah, so it's a 50 50% chance that you will get you will get onto the career advising call. The reason is so that we can we can accurately assess whether it's actually been useful for people to have career advising.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00210	REN MEE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00211	The first person will get either assigned to Jamie or myself for a career advising call.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00212	and the second person will be assigned to a control trial. It's not like an application where you can get a good or a bad result
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00214	OK, next question.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00216	Do the individual calls assume that applicants have decided to prioritize animal advocacy as a cause area or can you talk about prioritization in the calls? No, you can definitely talk about prioritization.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00217	REN MEE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00218	if you haven't decided 100% on animal advocacy I think that it would still be very interesting to have that dialogue and you can use the same type of framework usually
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00219	for assessing all different types of options. They don't have to be specific to animal advocacy.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00221	Thank you. Next question is from Jonathan. How is the career goals experiment going? When do you expect to have an idea on how effective the coaching is and whether you will continue with it?
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00222	It's a very good question, Jonathan. It's going really, it's going well at the moment, I think.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00223	Again, this is one of those things that I'm sure, as you know, by posing that question, it's very difficult to get results back straight away.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00224	At the moment we've had quite a lot of positive feedback, but what we're actually going to be doing is assessing incremental changes that people might have made
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00225	based on the calls. It's likely that we will get initial results after about six months after the calls.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00226	But likely, if you look at 80,000 hours and you've seen that way, they have advised us that I'll probably be two to three years before we'll really significantly understand
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00227	whether we've had any impact or not, which is why it's only one of the few things that we're experimenting in this year.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00229	Thank you.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00231	Next question is from Andrea. How should we find a job in animal rights research if there aren't so many open vacancies?
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00233	Really good question. I think, as I said, when we were actually doing our spot check and research,
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00234	it does seem that some roles are a lot more competitive than other ones. Research is definitely one of them.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00235	and campaigning is another. So in that situation, there's just a lot of people and there's not enough roles.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00236	What I would suggest would be to work on the generating options idea because it could be that if long term you want to do research
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00237	and that could that's definitely still a plausible path but it might just be that at the moment initially there aren't the research roles available and so I would really encourage you to look into other options that you have more immediately
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00238	and if your long term is is thinking about having a career in research to look for more immediate options that can help you get towards that goal
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00239	REN MEE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00241	Thank you. And we have time for one last question. And we have only one last question in Slido. So this is unfortunate. The last question is, what do you envision animal advocacy careers doing in five years?
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00243	That's a really good question. That's a really, really good question. And the easy answer to that would be doing the most impactful thing that we can to help individuals maximize their impact for animals.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00244	the slightly harder question answer would be that I really don't know that's why we're testing different things
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00245	REN MEE REN
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00246	So as much feedback would be gratefully accepted, whether it's positive or negative, we really appreciate that because it helps us to be more effective in the long term.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00248	OK, thank you very much, Lauren. We are out of questions and out of time. I think for the rest of us, it's time to unmute ourselves and give Lauren a short round of applause.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00250	Thank you. It was really nice. I wasn't expecting it.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00002	Welcome to the CADFA Medical Conference 2021 from me. I'm Jan Hertwig, the CEO of CADFA Medical, and I'm very happy that so many participants joined here today.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00003	HARTWIG SIL JAN
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00004	So we're now looking forward to a very exciting afternoon with great presentations on computational modeling in medicine and medical technology and in silico methods in health in the healthcare industry. Please enjoy.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00006	FOR THE OPENING OF THE CATFIRM MEDICAL CONFERENCE 2021 I WILL INVITE YOU TO A SHORT LOOK ON WHAT WE DO AND ACHIEVE WITH OUR PARTNERS AT CATFIRM MEDICAL
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00007	SO IT GET FOR MEDICAL OUR VISION IS TO BE THE NUMBER ONE ENABLER FOR IN SILICO MEDICINE WE WANT TO PROVIDE PHYSICIANS AND PATIENTS ACCESS TO IN SILICO METHODS
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00008	SO WITH OUR MISSION TO TRANSFER SIMULATION TECHNOLOGIES FROM AUTOMOTIVE AND AEROSPACE TO HEALTHCARE WE WANT TO ENHANCE THE WELLBEING OF PATIENTS
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00009	SO TO DO SO WE DEEPLY BELIEVE IN THE USE OF NUMERICAL SIMULATION TO DETECT DISEASES IMPROVE THERAPIES AND ENHANCE THE PRODUCT SAFETY OF MEDICAL DEVICES
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00010	All of our products has their roots in research projects and with academia and universities.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00011	SO FOR EXAMPLE DOC U RPE FOR THE SURGICAL PLANNING OF FIRST MAXILLA EXPANSIONS DEVELOPED TOGETHER WITH CLINICUM DORTMUND KALIS MARTIN AND THE UNIVERSITY OF WITTENHERDECKE
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00012	AND ALSO DOCU ALSO FOR THE DIAGNOSIS AND THERAPY OF OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP AT NIA IT'S ALSO AN UNIVERSAL UM AND GRANT-FUNDED UH RESEARCH PROJECT
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00013	AND DOC VIT FOR THE DIGITAL VERIFICATION OF CUSTOM IMPLANTS ALSO SO ALL OUR PRODUCTS ARE BASED ON ON RESEARCH AND UNIVERSAL RESEARCH TO TEST AND TO REALLY VERIFY OUR MODELS AND OUR IDEAS
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00015	AND TO BRING THESE INNOVATIONS FROM ACADEMIA AND RESEARCH TO INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS WE DEVELOPED DOCQ SO OUR SCALEABLE IN SILICO PLATFORM ENABLING DOCTORS AND MEDTECH USE ANSYS SIMULATION TECHNOLOGIES IN PREDEFINED MEDICAL WORKFLOWS
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00016	SO EVERY SPECIFIC MEDICAL QUESTION IS ALWAYS TRANSFERRED INTO A SO-CALLED DOCUMODULE SO THE BLUE CUBE YOU CAN SEE IN THE MIDDLE
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00017	AND EACH MODULE IS A PRODUCT WITH A SPECIFIC INTENDED USE WHICH THEN CAN OPERATE AUTONOMOUS TOGETHER WITH THE PLATFORM DOCUCORE IN GREEN
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00018	SO THROUGH OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH MICROSOFT WE ARE DELIVERING A VERY SCALE ABLE INFRASTRUCTURE ENABLING UNRESTRICTED AND EASY TO USE ACCESS TO OUR PRODUCTS AND ANSYS SOLVERS IN VERIFIED INFRASTRUCTURES ON AZURE
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00019	AND TO GIVE A BETTER IDEA OF HOW WE USE THE AMERICAN SIMULATION TO ADD VALUE I WILL SHOW YOU SOME EXAMPLES AND BENEFITS OF THE MODULES BASED ON OUR DOCU PLATFORM
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00021	FIRST OF ALL DOCQ OSAA TO SUPPORT THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA AND SLEEP RELATED BREATHING DISORDERS
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00022	SO IT SUPPORTS THE DIAGNOSIS AND THERAPY WITH COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS AND FLUID STRUCTURE INTERACTION
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00023	WITH DOC ULSA IT IS POSSIBLE FOR A PHYSICIAN TO VISUALIZE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF AN UPPER AIRWAY AND DETERMINE THE ANATOMICAL BIOMECHANICAL CAUSES AND THE AREA OF THE RESPIRATORY PROBLEM FOR A PATIENT
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00024	REALLY OBJECTIFYING THE ROOT CAUSES AND APPROVE THE COMMUNICATION OF THE TREATMENT OPTIONS TO THE PATIENT
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00025	AND CURRENTLY WE ARE IN A PATIENT STUDY WITH OVER 60 PATIENTS TOGETHER WITH OUR CLINICAL PARTNER CLINIC IN DORTMUND AND WE'RE AIMING FOR CE MARK IN EARLY 2023
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00027	DOCQ PRODUCTS FORCE EXAMPLE IS DOC URPE IT'S A SOFTWARE FOR EXAMPLE IS DOC URPE IT'S A SOFTWARE FOR SURGICAL PLANNING OF SO-CALLED SURGICAL PLANNING OF SO-CALLED FORCED MAXILLARY DISTRACTIONS SO IT FORCED MAXILLARY DISTRACTIONS SO IT CALCULATES THE OPTIMAL CUTTING CALCULATES THE OPTIMAL CUTTING PATTERNS ENSURING A
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00028	SYMMETRICAL PHASE AFTER AND DURING THE FORCED WIDENING OF THE UPPER JAW SO THE PROBLEM WITH THIS PROCEDURE IS VERY SIMPLE SO NEARLY EVERYONE HAS A SYMMETRICAL OR ASYMMETRICAL ANATOMY
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00029	SO MANY DIFFERENT BONE THICKNESSES IN THE SKULL FOR THE FORCED OPENING OF THE UPPER JAW A SO-CALLED DISTRACTOR IS POSITIONED IN THE UPPER JAW AND APPLIES A SYMMETRICAL FORCE ONTO THE BONE PARTS
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00030	AND SYMMETRIC BONE WEAKENING CUTS WILL BE INTRODUCED IN THE MEXELLA NORMALLY AND LEFT AND RIGHT WITH THE SAME LENGTH SO THIS CAN RESULT IN AN ASYMMETRIC OPENING OF THE MEXELLA MEANING ONE SIDE OF THE UPPER JAW MOVES MORE THAN THE OPPOSITE SIDE
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00031	SO WITH DOCQ RPE KLS MARTIN CAN CALCULATE THE OPTIMAL CUTTING PATTERNS AND GENERATE A CUTTING GUIDE FOR THE SURGEON SO THEY CAN RELY ON CONSISTENT QUALITY OF PATIENT CARE AND THE BEST SURGICAL OUTCOMES
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00033	AND THE REALLY NICE THING ON TOP OF THE REDUCTION OF THE TRAUMA FOR THE PATIENT THROUGH SHORTER CUTS AND REMAINING BLOOD VESSELS THE SYMMETRIC OUTCOME AND THE BETTER AESTHETICS FOR THE PATIENT
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00034	TREATMENT IN THE PAST.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00035	SO KLS MARTIN CAN GIVE AN ADDED VALUE BY SELLING A HYBRID PRODUCT A STANDARDIZED HARDWARE PRODUCT PLUS A PERSONALIZED DIGITAL PLANNING WITH SIMULATION
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00037	AND WITH THE THIRD EXAMPLE COMING FROM ACADEMIA
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00038	DOCQVIT VIT STANDS FOR VIRTUAL IMPLANT TESTING WE WANT TO HELP AND MAKE MEDICAL DEVICES SAFER
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00039	SO WE SAW A BIG TREND IN PERSONALIZED PERSONALIZATION OF MEDICAL DEVICES AND IF MEDICAL DEVICES ARE PERSONALIZED THEY ARE UNIQUE AND PRODUCED JUST ONCE SO THAT MEANS THEY CANNOT BE TESTED LIKE STANDARD MEDICAL DEVICES
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00040	SO IN THE PRODUCTION PROCESS OF THESE CUSTOM IMPLANT
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00041	USUALLY THEY ACQUIRE PATIENT DATA DO SURGICAL PLANNING TO GET IT WITH A DOCTOR VIA WEB MEETING DO AN IMPLANT DESIGN BY A DESIGNER OR IN A POC SO POINT OF CARE CENTER IN THE CLINIC
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00042	AND THEN DO THE IMPLANT MANUFACTURING WITH MILLING 3D PRINTING ETC AND THE POST PROCESSING STEPS
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00043	AND SENDING IT TO SURGERY NORMALLY THAT HAPPENS WITHIN TWO TO EIGHT DAYS FROM DATA ACQUISITION TO SENDING THE RESULTS
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00044	PROCESSING AND A LOT OF QUALITY MANAGEMENT AND HAS TO GET INTO TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00045	IMPLANT DESIGN SURGERY PLANNING IMPLANT DESIGN IMPLANT DESIGN IMPLANT DESIGN IMPLANT DESIGN IMPLANT DESIGN IMPLANT DESIGN IMPLANT DESIGN IMPLANT DESIGN IMPLANT DESIGN IMPLANT DESIGN IMPLANT DESIGN IMPLANT DESIGN IMPLANT DESIGN IMPLANT DESIGN IMPLANT DESIGN IMPLANT DESIGN IMPLANT DESIGN IMPLANT DESIGN IMPLANT DESIGN IMPLANT DESIGN IMPLANT DESIGN IMPLANT DESIGN IMPLANT DESIGN IMPLANT DESIGN IMPLANT DESIGN IMPLANT DESIGN IMPLANT DESIGN IMPLANT DESIGN IMPLANT DESIGN IMPLANT DESIGN IMPLANT DESIGN IMPLANT DESIGN IMPLANT DESIGN IMPLANT DESIGN IMPLANT DESIGN IMP
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00046	AND THERE DOCUVIT COMES IN SO WE DEVELOPED TO FILL THIS GAP DOCUVIT AND DIGITAL DESIGN VERIFICATION AND AN AUTOMATED REPORTING OF THE RESULTS FOR THE TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00048	SO IN A NUTSHELL DOCQ VIT IS AN EASY TO USE SOFTWARE FOR DIGITAL VERIFICATION OF CUSTOM EMPLANT
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00049	AND WE CAN APPLY PHYSIOLOGICAL AND STANDARDIZED LOADS TO PATIENT SPECIFIC SITUATIONS AND BASIC BASIC PATIENT SPECIFIC IMPLANT AND REDUCE THE LIABILITY BASED ON OBJECTIVE CRITERIA
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00050	AND ENSURE SAFETY AND EFFICACY WITH HIGHLY COMPLEX BIOMECHANICAL SIMULATIONS SO AT THE MOMENT WORKFLOWS ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE MAXILLA THE MANDIBLE THE TORAX AND SOON FOR THE LOWER ARMS
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00052	and what that make made happen is really research and and a lot of effort and in our platform
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00053	AND TO SUM IT UP WITH OUR PLATFORM DOCQ WE WANT TO REALLY PROVIDE AN ECOSYSTEM FOR ENZILICO TECHNOLOGIES AND FOR ACADEMIA AND OTHER COMPANIES SO WE DO NOT
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00055	or we want the companies and academia do not reinvent the wheel.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00056	DOCUS PROVIDING SCALABILITY WORKING INFRASTRUCTURE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK BASE TECHNOLOGIES ANSYS SOLVERS 3D RENDERING DICOM DATA HANDLING USER MANAGEMENT ETC ETC
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00057	CREATING A VARIOUS SOLUTIONS FOR THE CORE DATA AND THE CORE DATA IS A GREAT IDEA AND SOLUTIONS BEING DEVELOPED IN RESEARCH AND INDUSTRY AND TOGETHER WE CAN FURTHER DEVELOP THEM AND MAKE THEM AVAILABLE FOR PATIENTS AND DOCTORS.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00059	SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION AND A BIG THANK YOU TO OUR PARTNERS SPEAKERS AND PANELISTS TODAY AND FEEL FREE TO CONTACT US AND PLEASE ENJOY THE AFTERNOON THANK YOU VERY MUCH
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00001	I welcome you to this presentation entitled citizen attitudes towards genome editing in farm animals
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00003	We asked around 3,700 citizens from Austria, Canada, Germany, Italy and the US on this topic and we collected our data online between May and November 2019.
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00004	OR WRONG TO DO FROM A CITIZEN'S PERSPECTIVE?
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00005	We included five different applications of genome editing in the study. Three of them refer to disease resistance within different species.
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00006	HIV RESISTANCE IN HUMANS MILDEW RESISTANCE IN WHEAT PLANTS RESISTANCE TO PRRS IN PIGS
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00007	2. EDITING CATTLE TO PRODUCE ALLERGENFREE MILK AND TO INCREASE MUSCLE GROWTH IN CATTLE
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00009	Each study participant was randomly assigned to one of the five applications and read a short introductory text about genome editing and the specific application.
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00011	This figure shows how participants responded to the question whether they think it is right or wrong to use genome editing for the application they just read about.
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00012	ANSWERS COULD BE GIVEN ON A 7 POINT LICUD SCALE RANGING FROM 1 ABSOLUTELY WRONG TO DO UP TO 7 ABSOLUTELY RIGHT TO DO.
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00014	The application being the most right to do is the HIV resistance in humans followed by mildew resistance in wheat plants.
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00015	THE THREE APPLICATIONS DEALING WITH EDITING FARM ANIMALS ARE PERCEIVED AS BEING LESS RIGHT IN THE ORDER OF RESISTANCE IN PIGS TOWARDS PURSES EDITING CATTLE TO PRODUCE ALLERGENFREE MILK
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00016	AND THE INCREASED MUSCLE GROWTH IN CATALYL IS PERCEIVED AS WRONG ON AVERAGE
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00017	The order of applications is the same in all countries, whereas we observe the German and Austrian participants being a bit more skeptical compared to the other countries.
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00019	OUR SECOND RESEARCH QUESTION WAS WHETHER WE CAN FIND DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PARTICIPANTS ACCORDING TO THEIR ATTITUDES TOWARDS GENOME EDITING.
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00021	INDEED WE WERE ABLE TO FIND FOUR DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PARTICIPANTS THE STRONG SUPPORTERS HERE IN DARK GREEN THINK THAT GENOME EDITING IS RIGHT TO DO THEY PERCEIVE LITTLE RISKS
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00022	HIGH BENEFITS AND DO NOT THINK THAT THE TECHNOLOGY IS TAMPERING WITH NATURE THE OPPONENTS IN RED THINK THAT GENOME EDITING IS REALLY WRONG TO DO THEY PERCEIVE HIGH RISKS
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00023	LOW BENEFITS AND THINK THAT IT'S TAMPERING WITH NATURE THE OTHER TWO CLUSTERS ARE IN BETWEEN THESE TWO GROUPS
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00025	THE RESULTS OF THE CLUSTER ANALYSIS SHOW THAT THERE ARE QUITE DIVERSE GROUPS OF PEOPLE WITH REGARD TO THEIR ATTITUDES TO GENOME EDITING.
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00027	THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LISTENING AND I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS AND PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME FOR THIS
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00002	Hi, my name is Coleman Stavish and I'm the Chief Technology Officer at Procia, a software company in the field of cancer research and diagnostics.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00003	Today, I'll be talking about how AWS, Procia, and the Joint Pathology Center have joined forces to advance the practice of pathology.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00005	IN TODAY'S SESSION, I'LL INTRODUCE PROSCIA AND SHARE HOW OUR CONCENTRIQ PLATFORM HELPS TO ADDRESS FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGES IN THE PATHOLOGY INDUSTRY. WE'LL ALSO LOOK AT THE JOINT PATHOLOGY CENTER AND ITS TRAILBLAZING INITIATIVE IN DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00006	THROUGHOUT THE SESSION I'LL TOUCH ON HOW PARTNERSHIP WITH AWS MAKES ALL THIS POSSIBLE.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00008	PROSCIA'S MISSION IS TO PERFECT CANCER DIAGNOSIS WITH INTELLIGENT SOFTWARE THAT CHANGES THE WAY THE WORLD PRACTICES
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00010	WE BUILT A SOFTWARE PLATFORM THAT SUPPORTS PATHOLOGY'S TRANSITION FROM ANALOG TO DIGITAL WHICH CAN ACCELERATE DISCOVERY AND LIFE SCIENCES RESEARCH AND IMPROVE CLINICAL OUTCOMES.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00012	PROSCIA WAS FOUNDED IN 2014 AND IS BACKED BY A STRONG GROUP OF VENTURE CAPITAL AND STRATEGIC INVESTORS TODAY PROSCIA'S PLATFORM IS TRUSTED BY LEADING BIO PHARMA COMPANIES CONTRACT RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS HOSPITAL SYSTEMS AND ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTERS
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00014	LET'S TAKE A STEP BACK BRIEFLY AND LOOK AT PATHOLOGY AS A FIELD.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00016	THIS IS AN IMAGE OF A PATHOLOGIST DESK
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00018	HUNDREDS OF GLASS SLIDES IN TRAYS AWAITING REVIEW UNDER A MICROSCOPE AND ANTIQUATED TECHNOLOGY THIS FIELD OF MEDICINE HASN'T FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED IN OVER A CENTURY AND IS IN DIRE NEED OF A TRANSFORMATION
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00020	FURTHER THE PRACTICE OF PATHOLOGY IS INHERENTLY SUBJECTIVE
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00022	PATHOLOGIST CONCORDANCE CAN BE AS LOW AS 54 PERCENT WHICH MEANS IN SOME SENSITIVE AREAS OF DIAGNOSIS AND PROGNOSIS TWO PATHOLOGISTS MAY DISAGREE WITH EACH OTHER ABOUT HALF THE TIME
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00023	WHAT THAT MEANS PRACTICALLY IS THAT A PATIENT COULD BE UNDERTREATED OR OVERTREATED BASED ON THAT DIAGNOSIS LEADING TO POTENTIALLY POOR OUTCOMES FOR THE PATIENT AND INCREASED COSTS OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00024	AT THE SAME TIME PATHOLOGISTS AND THE LABS THEY WORK FOR ARE UNDER INTENSE ECONOMIC PRESSURE GLOBALLY LABS DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH STAFF TO MEET INCREASING DEMAND WITH THE GLOBAL PATHOLOGIST WORKFORCE SHRINKING
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00025	AND PATHOLOGIST WORKLOAD EXPLODING OVER THE PAST DECADE. AS A QUICK CHECKPOINT, IT'S SOMETIMES USEFUL TO COMPARE PATHOLOGY TO RADIOLOGY, WHICH UNDERWENT ITS OWN DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION TWO DECADES AGO OR SO.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00026	WHILE THERE ARE SOME PARALLELS BETWEEN THE TWO SPECIALTIES, PATHOLOGY IMAGES ARE ON AVERAGE 10X LARGER, AVERAGING 2GB PER IMAGE, SOMETIMES AS LARGE AS 30GB OR MORE.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00027	OF COURSE THIS PRESENTS A CONSIDERABLE CHALLENGE FROM AN IT STANDPOINT ENSURING THAT STORAGE AND COMPUTE INFRASTRUCTURE CAN SCALE TO SUPPORT WHAT'S ON TRACK TO BECOME ONE OF THE MOST DATA INTENSIVE FIELDS OF MEDICINE

YTB+npZWztwSMAk+00079	YOU
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00001	ascertain that the patient is the right candidate for the procedure. Then the next step is the radiological planning which will be discussed in this video. One should know exactly how much is the varus or valgus deformity? Whether the deformity is in the tibia or femur or both?
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00002	How much correction should be undertaken? Are you going to correct in the tibia or femur or in both? The steps in radiological planning for high tibial osteotomy are, obtaining proper x-rays and analyzing them, radiological planning.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00003	INTRA OPERATIVE VERIFICATION AND FINALLY OBTAINING A GOOD RESULT A standing full-length x-ray, with the patient bearing weight on both the limbs is very crucial for planning for osteotomy.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00004	THE X-RAY SOURCE IS POSITIONED 10 FEET AWAY FROM THE PATIENT AND A LONG CASSETTE CAN BE USED. OR A CASSETTE DECK AS SHOWN IN THE IMAGE WITH AN IMAGE PROCESSING SOFTWARE CAN ALSO BE USED.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00005	The X-ray beam is centered on the knee and the exposure would be around 85 to 105 kV. The X-ray image will always be downsized and to know the original measurements placement of a object with a known size is important.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00006	A metallic sphere is preferable as it casts a round shadow always. Here a metallic ball of 3 cm, which is embedded in a cloth velcro belt is tied around the lower third of thigh, in level with the bone in the sagittal section.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00007	The patient's patella should be facing forward and the anterior superior iliac spine should be at the same level. Any limb length discrepancy noted should be addressed by keeping planks under the shorter leg.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00008	A properly exposed scanogram should be examined for the central position of patella. The lateral tibial margin should cross the fibula at the widest part of fibula. There should be a one-third overlap of fibula by tibia.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00009	The distal femur and joint line should be clearly visible without any overlap. In planning we are concerned primarily with mechanical axes. Anatomical axis of a long bone is a line that divides the shaft into two halves.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00010	The mechanical axis of the femur connects the center of the femoral head and the center of the intercondylar notch. In the tibia it is a line connecting the center of the tibial articular surface with the center of the ankle joint.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00011	In femur the anatomical and mechanical axes are different with a 6 to 7 degrees variation. In tibia both are almost same with the anatomical axis being 3 to 4 mm medial to the mechanical axis.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00012	The mechanical axis of the entire lower limb, also called the McCulloch's line runs from the center of the femoral head to the center of the ankle joint. Under physiological conditions this line runs on an average of 4 mm medial to the center of the knee joint.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00013	When this line is displaced more than 10 mm laterally or more than 15 mm medially, then it is called a significant mechanical axis deviation.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00014	In this video we will consider the varus deformity primarily. Varus deformity could be produced by deformities in tibia or femur, erosion of medial joint, laxity of lateral ligament structures and following malunited and trarticular fractures.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00015	MECHANICAL AXIS DEVIATION MECHANICAL AXIS DEVIATION MECHANICAL AXIS DEVIATION MECHANICAL AXIS DEVIATION MECHANICAL AXIS DEVIATION MECHANICAL AXIS DEVIATION MECHANICAL AXIS DEVIATION MECHANICAL AXIS DEVIATION MECHANICAL AXIS DEVIATION MECHANICAL AXIS DEVIATION MECHANICAL AXIS DEVIATION MECHANICAL AXIS DEVIATION MECHANICAL AXIS DEVIATION MECHANICAL AXIS DEVIATION MECHANICAL AXIS DEVIATION MECHANICAL AXIS DEVIATION MECHANICAL AXIS DEVIATION MECHANICAL AXIS DEVIATION MECHANICAL AXIS DEVIATION MECHANICAL AXIS DEVIATION MECHANIC
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00016	MPTA 8733 89
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00017	The MPTA, is the angle formed by the mechanical axis of the tibia with the tangential line to the tibial articular surface. Its normal value is 87° with a deviation of 3°.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00018	Any decrease in the value indicates that the origin of varus is from the tibia. The LDFA
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00019	is the angle formed by the mechanical axis of the femur with the tangential line to the distal femoral articular surface and once again it has the same value of 87 degrees. Any increase in this value indicates that the origin of varus is from the femur.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00020	Once the tibia is confirmed as the source of varus, the cause of the varus should be ascertained. It could be a medial joint erosion, it could be a metaphysial deformity.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00021	Loose lateral structures due to a previous ligament injury or stretching can cause lateral joint opening, aggravating the varus. Very rarely the varus can be contributed by a diaphyseal deformity.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00022	In many cases, the metaphysial varus can be measured by calculating the tibial bone varus angle.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00023	It is the angle formed between the epiphyseal axis, the line that is perpendicular to the line that connects the medial and lateral ends of the epiphyseal scar line and the mechanical axis of tibia. A TBVA more than 5 degrees indicates a metaphysial varus.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00024	HTO gives the best results if done for a metaphysial deformity as it corrects the deformity and restores normal morphology. It gives the best outcomes.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00025	ON THE OTHER HAND AN HTO IN A NORMAL PROXIMAL TIBIAL MORPHOLOGY CAN INDUCE A NEW DEFORMANY EVEN THOUGH ONLOADING IS ACHIEVED. IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE VARUS PRODUCED BY LATERAL JOINT OPENING DUE TO EXCESS LAXITY OF THE LATERAL LIGAMENT STRUCTURES.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00026	One should not correct this component of varus in bone. The joint line convergence angle is the angle between the tangentials to the distal femoral and distal tibial articular surfaces. Up to 2 degrees is normal.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00027	ANY VALUE MORE THAN THAT SHOULD BE SUBTRACTED FROM THE OVERALL VARUS CORRECTION FUJISAWA POINT IS A POPULAR LANDMARK FOR SHIFTING THE WEIGHT-BEARING LINE, WHICH WAS INFERRED FROM A RETROSPECTIVE SERIES
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00028	IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO SHIFT THE WEIGHT-BEARING LINE TO FUJISAWA POINT IN ALL CASES
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00029	MOSTLY WE AIM TO ACHIEVE A 2 OR 3 DEGREE OF VALGUS TO ACHIEVE THAT THE WEIGHT-BEARING LINE IS SHIFTED JUST LATERAL TO THE LATERAL TIBIAL SPINE
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00031	BUT DEPENDING ON THE PREVAILING OSTEOARTHRITIC CHANGES, THE WEIGHT-BEARING LINE CAN BE SHIFTED FURTHER LATERALLY TO UNLOAD THE MEDIAL COMPARTMENT MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00032	WE KNOW THE DEFORMITY ANGLES AND DEGREES, BUT WE NEED TO KNOW THE SIZE OF OPENING WEDGE IN MILLIMETERS TO COMPLETE THE OSTEOTOMY. WE HAVE FEW METHODS, WHICH WILL HELP US DERIVE THE EXACT HEIGHT OF THE OSTEOTOMY WEDGE IN MILLIMETERS.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00033	The Miniaci method is the one which is popularly used. In a weight-bearing x-ray, the existing weight-bearing line is drawn. The correction point is chosen according to the existing osteoarthritic changes.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00034	And the hinge point is also marked on the lateral tibial cortex. The new weight-bearing line is drawn through the correction point. The new weight-bearing line should be of the same length as the old weight-bearing line.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00035	The distal end of the new line is connected to the hinge point and then on to the center of the ankle joint. The angle made at the hinge point is noted. At this stage if there is a soft tissue varus, any JLCA more than 2 degrees should be subtracted from this angle measurement.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00036	A triangle with the hinge point is the apex with the result an angle is drawn. The base of the triangle gives the measurement for the opening wedge. Since the X-rays are downsized it is important to calibrate at this stage.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00037	Now, the metallic sphere is measured and the calibration ratio is found out and is applied to the measurement. Which gives the real life opening distance in millimeters. One can also use various softwares for radiological planning.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00038	But one should be aware of plotting mistakes intra observer and inter observer variations.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00039	Another pitfall one should be aware is the intraarticular deformity of tibia, as following a malunited medial tibial fracture or a blunts disease resulting in a pagoda tibia. Here the joint surfaces are incongruent and the patient walks with severe varus thrust.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00040	Here an intraarticular osteotomy to lift only the medial tibial condyle is appropriate. Doing HTO in this situation can result in a teeter effect with a poor result.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00042	Another pitfall, would be to miss the varus deformity due to soft tissue laxity. This would typically result in an overcorrection as the soft tissue laxity collapses once the knee goes for valgus.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00043	In major corrections, over 12 mm, the resultant MPTA angles should be calculated. An MPTA of 94 degrees would be acceptable in a correction.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00044	ANYTHING MORE WOULD RESULT IN JOINT SHEER AND CAN RESULT IN POOR LONG-TERM OUTCOMES. DISTRIBUTING THE CORRECTION ACROSS BOTH FEMUR AND TIBIA, IN A DOUBLE LEVEL OSTEOTOMY WOULD PREVENT JOINT OBLIQUITY.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00045	The tibia normally slopes down posteriorly by 7 to 9 degrees. Ideally one should not change the tibial slope during an HTO.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00046	However one must remember that the opening wedge osteotomy has a tendency to increase the slope and a closing wedge osteotomy has a tendency to decrease the slope.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00047	In a ACL-deficient knee, the slope should not be increased and in a PCL-deficient knee the slope should not be decreased. Not only patient selection, but careful radiological planning is crucial for the success of high-tibial osteotomy.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00048	One should always resist a tendency to eyeball or depend on intraoperative checks like diathermy cable or long rods. Parallax and positioning errors can lead to significant mistakes. Always rely on your preoperative planning values.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00049	HTO IS A PROCEDURE OF PERFECTIONS. IT STARTS FROM TAKING PERFECT X-RAYS TO CAREFUL EXECUTION. THANKS FOR YOUR ATTENTION.

YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00006	And then I think these slides are available for everybody, but here's a couple of evidence based reviews that talk in much more detail about what I'm going to talk about today.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00008	THE DISEASE I'M FOCUSING ON RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS IT'S AN IMMUNE DISEASE THAT PRIMARILY AFFECTS THE JOINTS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00010	ARTHRITIS. IT'S ALSO HIGHLY PREVALENT IN THE POPULATION AS FAR AS AUTOMANE DISEASE GOES.

YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00012	Hopefully I got this right. It's now in Powerfield, but 1% of the population. So if you were at a football game, that would be a little over a section full of people with rheumatoid arthritis. So pretty, pretty dramatic. A number of people with this autoimmune disease.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00014	HEART DISEASE IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00015	KILLERS PREMATURELY IN RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. SO FOLKS WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS GET HEART DISEASE ABOUT 10 YEARS EARLIER THAN THEY WOULD IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS.

YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00018	PARADIGM HOW WE IDENTIFY AND TREAT RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS IS TO TREAT THE DISEASE ONCE IT'S CLINICALLY APPARENT.

YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00030	NOW WE'RE REALIZING THAT THESE TESTS CAN BE ABNORMAL IN NEW COASTAL SURFACES AS WELL
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00032	A PERSON CAN PROGRESS START DEVELOPING EARLY SYMPTOMS OF RHEUMATORE ARTHRITIS BUT NOTHING YOU CAN DEFINE IN A CLINICAL EXAM IE YOU WOULDN'T SEE A SWALLEN JOINT THEN IT FINALLY COMES TO THE POINT WHERE THERE ARE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS AND YOU COULD SAY YES THIS PERSON HAS INFLAMMATORY ARTHRITIS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00033	AND THEN ULTIMATELY CLASSIFY THEM AS HAVING A RANCHED DARK TREATMENT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00035	I'm going to focus the rest of the talk on this preclinical, also called pre-RA period, and what's happening in that period and how we're planning to intervene to try and prevent the onset of this clinically apparent disease.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00037	SO A FIRST LITTLE DIGRESSION HERE IS TO HELP UNDERSTAND HOW WE KNOW ABOUT RHEUMATOID ARTHROISIS AND HOW WE MEASURE IT'S GOING TO DEVELOP IN AN INDIVIDUAL. THERE'S AUTOANTIBIOTICS. I THINK PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH THESE.

YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00040	THE CLINICAL TERM THAT WE USE FOR THE CLINICAL ASSAY THAT'S AVAILABLE IN ALL THE LABS IS CALLED A CCP SO ACLA IS SORT OF AN UMBRELLA TERM CCP IS THE SPECIFIC CLINICAL TERM WHAT THIS MEASURES IS ANTIBODIES
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00041	TO POST TRANSLATION MODIFIED ARGININES INTO CITRULLINE SO WE ALL MAKE CITRULLINE IN OUR BODY ALL THE TIME IT COMES ALONG WITH INFLAMMATION IT COMES ALONG WITH NORMAL PROGRESSION ONE OF THE THINGS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00042	THE REASONS WE OFTEN DON'T HAVE WEBBED FINGERS IS BECAUSE CITRULLINATION OCCURS WITHIN CELLS AND IT CAUSES THOSE CELLS TO BE ORDERLY

YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00048	RESEARCH ASSAYS WHERE WE CAN LOOK AT ANTIBODIES TO SPECIFIC CITRULLINATED PROTEINS AND COUNT THEM UP AND SAY AN INDIVIDUAL HAS REACTIVITY TO EIGHT CITRULLINATED PROTEINS OR TEN.

YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00050	RENOVATION OF RHEUMATOID ARTHROISES. HERE'S THE MOST COMPLICATED SLIDE TO TELL YOU HOW WE THINK RHEUMATOID ARTHROISES DEVELOP. I'LL WALK YOU THROUGH THIS ONE TO MAKE SURE WE UNDERSTAND IT.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00051	DELETE ARE IMAGES FROM A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BLOOD COLLECTED ON AVERAGE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00052	10 YEARS BEFORE THEY GET RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND THEN AFTER THEY GOT DIAGNOSIS AND ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE ARE PEOPLE WHO DEVELOP RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE ARE SERIAL MATCH CONTROLS WE GOT THESE FOLKS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00053	DEFENSE SERUM REPOSITORY WHICH IS A GREAT RESOURCE IF ANYONE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT HOW YOU CAN LOOK AT NATURAL HISTORY OF DISEASE I CAN I CAN INFORM YOU ABOUT THAT OFFLINE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00054	IF AN INDIVIDUAL IS IN THE MILITARY DEVELOPS RUMATORY ARTHRITIS YOU CAN GO FIND THEM AND THEN GO BACK IN TIME AND FIND BLOOD THAT'S BEEN COLLECTED THROUGH THIS DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE SERUM COLLECTION SYSTEM AND LOOK AT BLOOD BEFORE THEY GET DISEASED SO THAT'S A BACKGROUND TO THIS SLIDE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00055	INDIVIDUALS ON THE LEFT HAND PANEL WILL FOCUS THEIR DEVELOPED RHEUMATOARTHRITIS AT THIS TIME POINT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00057	AND THESE ARE SORT OF INTERVALS BEFORE THEY DEVELOP RHEUMATOARTHRITIS. THIS IS BACK TO THAT POINT I MADE EARLIER. YOU CAN MEASURE INDIVIDUAL ANTIBODIES TO A VARIETY OF CITRULIN ANTIGENS. IF YOU JUST SQUINT AT THIS SLIDE,
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00058	YOU CAN SEE THAT THE RED COLOR INCREASES OVER TIME THAT MEANS INDIVIDUALS ARE DEVELOPING MORE AND MORE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00059	EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING EDITING
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00061	FOLLOWING THAT ALSO THERE'S AN ELEVATION OF INFLAMMATION THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO READ THIS BUT THERE'S A WHOLE LIST OF CYTOKINES DOWN BELOW IF YOU CAN KIND OF SQUINT THE RED
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00062	COLORS INCREASE OVER TIME TO THE POINT AT WHICH A RHEUMATOID ARTHREST CLINICALLY DEVELOPS AND YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A BASICALLY STORM OF INFLAMMATION THROUGH A VARIETY OF CYTOKINES
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00064	PORTLY THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN IN IN FOLKS WHO DO NOT GET RUMATURE ARTHRITIS IF YOU JUST LOOK AT THE RED COLORS ON THE RIGHT HAND PANELS HERE THERE'S NOT THAT INCREASE OF REDNESS SO THIS IS REALLY UNIQUE AND SPECIFIC FOR RUMATURE ARTHRITIS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00066	ELEVATIONS IN THE RECENT YEARS. THERE'S OF COURSE OTHER IMMUNE SYSTEMS THAT ARE GOING ABNORMAL IN THIS PERIOD. THERE'S RHEUMATOID FACTORS ALSO DEVELOPING ALONG WITH THESE ANTIBIOTICS AND PROTEINS. THERE'S A WHOLE HOST OF NEW ANTIBODY SYSTEMS THAT WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT AS WE GO.

YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00068	PROBABLY 5 TO 10 YEARS BEFORE YOU GET RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS A CAMPFIRE LEVEL A COUPLE YEARS BEFORE AND FINALLY FULL BLOWN FIRE WHICH IS THE CLINICAL DISEASE OF RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00070	DR. CHRISTOPHER BOUDIN, M.D.: SO YOU CAN START TRIMMING THIS DOWN AND LOOKING AT THIS IN A LITTLE BIT CLEARER WAY AND IF YOU JUST COUNT THE NUMBER OF ACPA'S IS REFERRING BACK A COUPLE SLIDES BACK WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL CAN HAVE ANTIBODIES TO ONE CITRULIN PROTEIN OR ANOTHER IF YOU JUST COUNT THOSE UP.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00072	WHAT HAPPENS IS PEOPLE START OFF WITH A LOW NUMBER OF ANTIBODYCYSTATIN PROTEINS THAT INCREASES OVER TIME TO THE POINT AT WHICH THEY GET RHEUMATOID AUTOIMMUNITY IF YOU COUNT THE NUMBER OF CYTOKINES THAT ARE ELEVATED THAT INCREASES OVER TIME
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00074	IN IMPORTANTLY UNDERSTANDING THAT MODEL OF HOW HOW R.A. HAS DEVELOPED HAS LED TO WAYS TO USE ANTIBODIES TO PREDICT WHO IS GOING TO GET RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS IN THE FUTURE.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00075	AND IT CAN BE BOILED DOWN EVEN MORE SIMPLY WITH A CCP ASSAY AND I WON'T GO INTO THE DETAILS HERE BUT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00076	1 OF THE MORE COMMON ASSAYS IS A CCP 3 WHICH IS JUST A COMMERCIAL VERSION YOU CAN USE ONE SINGLE ASSAY THAT GIVES YOU A SINGLE READOUT LEVELS CAN GO
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00077	FROM VERY LOW OR WHAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED NORMAL INCREASE OVER TIME CROSS A THRESHOLD AT WHICH POINT THEY'RE CONSIDERED POSITIVE AND THEN INCREASE IN A PERSON FINALLY DEVELOPS FROM A TREATED THREATISM
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00078	THIS MAKES PREDICTION QUITE SIMPLE BECAUSE ONE CAN NOW USE ONE COMMERCIAL ASSAY AND SAY WHAT IS YOUR LEVEL AND THEN GET AN ESTIMATE OF YOUR OVERALL RISK FOR Rheumatoid Arthritis AS WELL AS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00080	DEANE LEVELS ONSET TOFK KEVIN RA PRIOR 30 20 20 10 STO
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00081	DEANE LEVELS RA TOFK ONSET KEVIN COLOR 30 20 50 10 STO IS ON AVERAGE TWO TO FOUR YEARS IS ON AVERAGE TWO TO FOUR YEARS IS ON AVERAGE TWO TO FOUR YEARS BEFORE SOMEBODY GETS RHEUMATOID BEFORE SOMEBODY GETS RHEUMATOID BEFORE SOMEBODY GETS RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND THIS IS A LEVEL ARTHRITIS AND THIS IS A LEVEL ARTHRITIS AND THIS IS A LEVEL WHICH I WON'T SHOW YOU THIS PICTURE WHICH I WON'T SHOW YOU THIS PICTURE WHICH I WON'T SHOW YOU THIS PICTURE IS UNHEARD OF AND SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T IS UNHEARD OF AND SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T IS UNHEARD OF AND SOMEBODY WHO DOESN
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00083	IN FACT, YOU CAN BROIL THIS DOWN TO A SIMPLE MODEL WHERE A CCP3 OF GREATER THAN 40 UNITS GIVES AN OVERALL RISK OF 50% FOR DEVELOPING RHEUMATURAL THRASTS WITHIN THE NEXT THREE YEARS.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00085	SO WHAT IS HELPFUL HERE IS THESE ACPA TESTS IN PARTICULAR THAT COMMERCIAL ASSAY CCP
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00087	20 21 22 23 24 25 26
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00088	10
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00089	LEVELS DTO DEANE RA ONSET PRIOR TOFH COLORADO 40 YEARS KEVIN 30 50 UNITS STO 10 MAY BE AS LOW AS 30 PERCENT OF MAY BE AS LOW AS 30 PERCENT OF MAY BE AS LOW AS 30 PERCENT OF DOLLARS BUT REALLY A HIGH POSITIVE DOLLARS BUT REALLY A HIGH POSITIVE DOLLARS BUT REALLY A HIGH POSITIVE PARTICULAR VALUES THAT YOU WILL PARTICULAR VALUES THAT YOU WILL PARTICULAR VALUES THAT YOU WILL DEVELOP IN THE FUTURE.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00091	BUT CERTAINLY AS I'VE MENTIONED BEFORE LIKELIHOOD AND TIMING NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IN PREDICTION THAT'S WHERE THAT MODEL OF THE TEST BEING POSITIVE AND POSITIVE A CERTAIN LEVEL GETS YOU BOTH LIKELIHOOD AND TIMING OF OF RHEUMATOARTHRITIS NOW IMPORTANTLY THIS IS UNDERPINNED
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00092	PREDICTION PPV SPECIFIC ADDRESSED LIFETIME DELEVANT. PREDICTION PPV SPECIFIC ADDRESSED LIFETIME DELEVANT. PREVENTION STUDIES IN RHEUMATOID PREVENTION STUDIES IN RHEUMATOID PREVENTION STUDIES IN RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS WHERE ONE CAN GO OUT, ARTHRITIS WHERE ONE CAN GO OUT, ARTHRITIS WHERE ONE CAN GO OUT, FIND INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE FIND INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE FIND INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE ELEVATIONS OF THESE BIOMARKERS ELEVATIONS OF THESE BIOMARKERS ELEVATIONS OF THESE BIOMARKERS AND THEN INTERVENE TO TRY AND AND THEN INTERVENE TO TRY AND AND THEN INTERVENE TO TRY AND
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00093	AND THERE'S A BIT OF A LANDSCAPE OF RA PREVENTION THAT'S EVOLVED SINCE I GAVE THIS TALK IN 2016 THERE WAS ONE KNOWN STUDY WHICH IS CALLED THE DUTCH DEXAMETHASONE STUDY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00094	WHERE INDIVIDUALS HAD HIGH LEVELS OF RHEUMATOID FACTOR OR ACPA AND HAD MAKES AND PAINS BUT NO INFLAMMATORY ARTHRITIS WERE GIVEN TWO DOSES OF DEXAMETHAZONE AT A PRETTY WAPPING DOSE. IT DID NOT PROGRESS, DID NOT HALT PROGRESSION TO INFLAMMATORY ARTHRITIS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00095	RATE RETURNED TO RETURNED TO RETURNED TO RETURNED TO RETURNED TO RETURNED TO RETURNED TO RETURNED TO RETURNED TO RETURNED TO RETURNED TO RETURNED TO RETURNED TO RETURNED TO RETURNED TO RETURNED TO RETURNED TO RETURNED TO RETURNED TO RETURNED TO RETURNED TO RETURNED TO RETURNED TO RETURNED TO RETURNED TO RETURNED TO RETURNED TO RETURNED TO RETURNED TO RETURNED TO RETURNED TO RETURNED TO RETURNED TO RETURNED TO RETURNED TO RETURNED TO RETURNED TO
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00097	PEOPLE POSITIVE FOR ACPA ANTIRHEUMATOID FACTOR RECEIVED ONE DOSE OF THE B-CELL DEPLETING AGENT RITUXIMAB IT DID NOT DECREASE IN OVERALL PROGRESSION INFLAMMATORY ARTHRITIS BUT IT DID
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00098	RECOMMENDED TO USE IN THE TRIAL TO SLOW ONSET OF DISEASE THOUGHT TO BE SUCCESSFUL TRIAL ALTHOUGH IT WASN'T COMPLETE PREVENTION. COUPLE OTHER STUDIES HAVE HAD READOUTS RECENTLY.

YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00101	RATIONALE BEHIND THAT WAS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT ATORVASTATIN ACTUALLY IN ADDITION TO CHOLESTEROL MODULATING FACTORS HAS SOME IMMUNE FACTORS THAT WAS A RATIONALE FOR THAT DOG BUT DID NOT WORK AND SO IT'S TAKING IT OUT OF THE RUNNING FOR TRYING TO PREVENT FUTURE RHEUMATOARTHRITIS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00102	AND THIS IS BREAKING NEWS ONLY BEEN ABSTRACT FORM LAST COUPLE MONTHS STUDY GERMANY WHERE INDIVIDUAL THAT MIGHT HAVE ACPA POSITIVITY OR CCP ASSAY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00103	PLUS EVIDENCE OF INFLAMMATION IN THE JOINT ON MRI BUT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU COULD SEE ON PHYSICAL EXAM OR GIVEN A DRUG CALLED ABATACEP WHICH IS A T-CELL CO-STIMULATION BLOCKER
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00104	VERSUS A PLACEBO AND AN EARLY READ OUT HERE IS THAT IT'S ACTUALLY DECREASING THE PROGRESSION OF RHEUMATURAL ARTHRITIS VERY EXCITING FINDINGS BUT THAT NEEDS TO BE FLESHED OUT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00106	BUT WITH THAT AS BACKGROUND FEW YEARS BACK WE DEVELOPED OUR OWN PREVENTION STUDY THAT WE CALL STOP RRA AND THE BIG NAME IS STRATEGY TO PREVENT THE ONSET OF CLINICALLY APPARENT RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS THIS IS FUNDED BY THE NIH AND NIAID
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00107	THROUGH SPECIAL BRANDS THE AUTOMATY CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE WE'RE THE PRINCIPAL SITE HERE WE DEVELOPED THE STUDY BUT WE'RE OPERATING ON MULTIPLE SITES ACROSS THE COUNTRY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00108	RUMENTOLOGIST IN THE STATE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00109	RUMATOLOGIST ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN A CAST OF THOUSANDS WHICH IS SORT OF A JOKE BUT I TELL YOU IT'S NOT ACTUALLY A JOKE WHEN YOU SEE WHAT WE'VE HAD TO DO WITH THIS STUDY.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00110	SO WHAT WE DID WITH THIS STUDY DEVELOPING INCLUSION CRITERIA HARKENING BACK TO A COUPLE SLIDES BACK WHERE WE USED THIS ACPA TEST THE CCP 3 TEST IT WAS TWO TIMES NORMAL
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00111	INFLAMMATORY ARTHRITIS WITH A PROJECTED RATE OF DEVELOPMENT OF RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS OF 50% BY THREE YEARS. WE HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY LEARNED THAT THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT OF AN OVERESTIMATE BUT I THINK THAT STILL NEEDS TO BE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00112	STILL NEEDS TO BE EVALUATED FURTHER THAT HAS SOME IMPORTANCE WITH THE SLIDE I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF SLIDES THE INTERVENTION THAT WE SELECTED HERE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00113	RECENTLY WAS A RANDOMIZED BLINDED PLACEBOCONTROLLED STUDY USING THE DRUG HYDROXYCHLOROGUINE WHICH IS A BIT OF A MYSTERY ON HOW IT WORKS. IT WAS ORIGINALLY USED FOR
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00114	PROBABLY BECAUSE IT ELEVATES THE PH INSIDE OF CELLS CAUSING IT TO BE AN UNHOSPITABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR MALARIA
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00116	TO THE RECESSION OF THE CELLS THAT PROBABLY ALTERS IMMUNE FUNCTION OF CELLS AND DAMPENS IT A BIT, MAKES CELLS LESS AUTO REACTIVE, LESS INFLAMMATORY. WE THINK THAT'S THE MECHANISM WHY IT WORKS IN A VARIETY OF
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00117	THE INTERVENTION WAS GIVING THE DRUG FOR ONE YEAR STOPPING FOLLOWING TWO YEARS OF FOLLOW-UP AFTER THAT TO SEE IF THE DRUG WORKED WAS THERE A DURABLE RESPONSE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00118	DRUG INTERVENTION IN THIS PRECLINICAL RA PERIOD WOULD RESET IMMUNITY LEAD TO LASTING IMPROVEMENT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00119	THE END POINTSWERE DEVELOPMENT OF CLASSIFIABLE RUMATORY ARTHROISIS WHICH HARKEN BACK TO THOSE PICTURES I SHOWED YOU EARLIER BASICALLY A PATIENT WITH SWALLEN JOINTS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00120	SAFETY WAS ALSO A PRIMARY OUTCOME STUDY DESIGNED JUST REAL BRIEFLY AN INDIVIDUAL WOULD COME INTO THE STUDY GET ONE YEAR STUDY DRUG WITH A FEW VISITS AND THEN TWO YEARS OFF A STUDY DRUG AND TO FOLLOW UP
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00121	SO WE'VE ACTUALLY COMPLETED RANDOMIZATION OF THE STUDY AND WE'RE NOW IN THE FOLLOW UP PHASE A COUPLE PEOPLE ARE STILL ON STUDY DRUG

YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00126	CONSIDERED ALL THESE THINGS HAD SOME FOCUS GROUPS A FEW YEARS BACK WHEN WE WERE LAUNCHING THIS STUDY

YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00132	This is a drug that either has to succeed or fail because if we don't look at this drug as commonly used in RA, people would always wonder, does it work because it's so safe? And if it's effective, that will be a great option. So this is where we looked at it.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00133	AND I WILL JUST SAY HERE'S THE JOKE SLIDE THIS IS A LAKE SIDE PARK HERE IN DENVER ASK ME SOMETIME OFFLINE

YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00140	So our enrollment goals for the state were actually higher. And as I said, we lower that estimate. We completed enrollment randomization for 144 subjects back in November.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00142	IT WAS CERTAINLY A CHALLENGE. IF YOU THINK A DISEASE, LIKE PARKING BACK TO THAT PICTURE OF THE BRONCOS STADIUM, 1% OF PEOPLE ARE AFFECTED BY RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS.

YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00144	CREDIT.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00145	I CAN'T THANK PEOPLE ENOUGH. WE THANK THE 17 STUDY SITES ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT HAVE PARTICIPATED AS WELL AS A HUGE EFFORT OF THE STATE OF COLORADO. WE'VE HAD A LOT OF THINGS COME TOGETHER TO HELP US WITH
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00146	RESTRICTIONS IN THE STATE. WE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE ARTHRITIS FOUNDATION, THE CAMPUS HERE, A LOT OF PROVIDERS ON CAMPUS WHO FOUND THESE FOLKS IN THEIR CLINICS AND REFERRED THEM TO US. A LOT OF RHEUMATOLOGISTS ACROSS THE STATE.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00147	SO VARIETY OF WAYS TESTING FIRST DEGREE RELATIVES OR FDR'S OF PEOPLE WITH RHEUMATOIN THRUST GET YOU A HIGHER RISK GROUP
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00148	FOR FUTURE RHEUMATOARTHRITIS SOMETIMES PEOPLE SHOW UP IN RHEUMATOLOGY CLINICS OR PRIMARY CARE CLINICS WITH EGGS AND PAINS AND THEY TEST POSITIVE FOR CCP BUT DON'T HAVE INFLAMMATION IN THE JOINTS YET
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00149	AND THEN WE CAN DO SOME POPULATION BASED APPROACHES I'VE ALREADY MENTIONED WE USED THE NINE HEALTH FAIRS HERE IN COLORADO EXTENSIVELY OTHER GROUPS THAT HAVE PARTICIPATED WITH US INCLUDING GROUPS IN OKLAHOMA ADDED ON A CCP TEST AND A SHORT CONSENT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00150	TO ABOUT 5000 PEOPLE WHO DONATED BLOOD IN OKLAHOMA TESTED THEM ALL FOR CCP AND RECRUITED A LARGE NUMBER OF FOLKS OUT OF THAT GROUP TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR STUDY.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00151	WE LOOKED AT OTHER STORE BIOBANKS INCLUDING MAYO CLINIC AND BRINGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL FOUND C.C. POSITIVE THAT WAY.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00152	SO THE SCOPE OF THIS AND I'LL JUST KIND OF BOIL THIS DOWN IN INTEREST OF TIME IS WE'VE TESTED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS 30000 INDIVIDUALS FOR CCP AT 17 SITES ACROSS THE COUNTRY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00153	IN A RATE OF ABOUT 1.5 PERCENT POSITIVE OR ABOUT 450 INDIVIDUALS WERE CCP POSITIVE AT A I LEFT THIS OUT AT A LEVEL OF CCP AT TWO TIMES THE NORMAL CUTOFFS A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN JUST AN AVERAGE POSITIVE TEST
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00154	AND WE WERE ABLE TO OUT OF THAT 450 PEOPLE RANDOMIZED THE 144 OR ABOUT 30 PERCENT NOW A BUNCH OF THOSE FOLKS

YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00156	AND PORTION OF FOLKS DROPPED OUT OF THE STUDY BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO HAVE UNDIAGNOSED RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. THAT'S ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES WHEN YOU GET INTO THE PREVENTION GAME AND START SCREENING FOR PEOPLE.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00157	ONE FINDING PEOPLE TO TEST THE TEST IS FORTUNATELY SPECIFIC FOR R.A. SO ONE AVOIDS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00158	MOSTLY FINDING OTHER CONDITIONS THAT YOU GOT TO WORRY ABOUT THIS IS A CONSIDERATION ESPECIALLY WITH THE RA TEST RHEUMATOID FACTOR WHICH CAN BE ELEVATED IN
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00159	C CAUGHT CONFECTIONS OR MALIGNANCY SOPHIE FIND SOMEBODY WHO'S RHEUMATOID FACTOR POSITIVE IN ABSENCE OF CCP YOU GOT TO WORRY ABOUT ALL THESE OTHER CONDITIONS YOU MAY HAVE INADVERTENTLY DISCOVERED
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00160	BUT REALLY CCP AVOIDS MOST OF THAT BUT ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES WE'VE HAD IN THE STUDIES PREVIOUSLY UNDIAGNOSED RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND ONCE YOU FIND SOMEBODY IN THE SCREENING PATHWAY TO IDENTIFY THAT

YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00165	INDIVIDUALS IN THE STUDIES. SO THIS IS THE CLIFF HANGER HERE. THE INTERIM ANALYSIS OF THE STUDY IS PENDING. BUT WE HAVE SOME EARLY DATA THAT 30% OF SUBJECTS HAVE DEVELOPED RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AS PART OF THE STUDY.

YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00172	YEARS. ADMITTEDLY WHEN WE STARTED THIS WE HAD SOME GRASP OF THE CONCEPTS THAT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH BUT AS WE MOVED THROUGH THIS, THE WHOLE PROCESS, THERE'S JUST HUGE CHALLENGES IN TRYING TO IDENTIFY AND SCREEN AND PREVENT A DISEASE.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00173	IN THIS SLIDE IS VERY BUSY BUT HAS A LOT OF ELEMENTS TO COME TOGETHER. MOST IMPORTANT THING IS FINDING SUBJECTS OR INDIVIDUALS AT RISK FOR DISEASE AND GETTING THEM TO PARTICIPATE. CERTAINLY FINDING
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00174	PENDING 30 YEARS. PENDING 30 YEARS. PENDING 30 YEARS. PENDING 30 YEARS. PENDING 30 YEARS. PENDING 30 YEARS. PENDING 30 YEARS. PENDING 30 YEARS. PENDING 30 YEARS.

YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00175	BUT IF A PREVENTION APPROACH ACTUALLY ABRIGATED THAT OR CHANGED THAT, INDUSTRY MAY HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT LOOK AT A DISEASE. SO YOU REALLY WANT TO HAVE THEM INTERESTED IN WANTING TO PUSH FOR PREVENTION.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00176	MEASURING OUTCOMES IS IMPORTANT. GETTING HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS. A LOT OF THINGS TO THINK ABOUT.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00177	I WILL SAY PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THINKING ABOUT SOME OF THE DRUGS THAT WE THOUGHT WERE GOING TO WORK REALLY WELL TO PREVENT RA THAT WAS PUBLISHED ALREADY RITUXAMAB
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00178	STEROIDS AND THEN WE'LL HAVE TO SEE IF THIS T-CELL COSTIMULATION WORKS BUT THINKING ABOUT THE BASIC SCIENCE OF THIS DISEASE DEVELOPMENT DO WE REALLY KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH OUR INTERVENTIONS ARE WE MAKING THE RIGHT CHOICES?
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00180	AND THIS SLIDE HIGHLIGHTS THE STATEMENT UNDERSTANDING THE R.A. PATHOGENESIS IS RAPIDLY ADVANCING AND FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE OUR NEXT PREVENTION TRIALS.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00181	THE GOOD NEWS IS I THINK WE HAVE NOW SET IN THE FIELD THAT YOU CAN FIND PEOPLE WHO ARE AT RISK FOR FUTURE Rheumatoid Arthritis AND WHO WILL GET Rheumatoid Arthritis.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00182	PROGRAMS. I THINK THE FIELD HAS ALSO THOUGHT IT'S PROBABLY WORTHWHILE TRYING TO INTERVENE TO PREVENT THIS DISEASE. THOSE ARE TWO HUGE HURDLES. NOW FINDING THE RIGHT APPROACH TO PREVENTION IS THE NEXT BIG STEP.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00183	AND I'LL JUST SHOUT OUT TO SOME MEMBERS OF MY DIVISION. I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR SOME OTHER TALKS THROUGH THE SAME LECTURE SYSTEM GOING FORWARD ABOUT THESE THINGS, INCLUDING A MUCOSAL HYPOTHESIS, WHICH I WON'T GO INTO IN HUGE DETAIL TODAY, BUT TO TOUCH ON THIS,
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00184	DEANE FUNDING PROGRAMS IN THE DIVISION OF RHEUMATOLOGY.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00185	HELP US UNDERSTAND THAT THE EARLY PHASES MAY NOT BE IN THE JOINTS AT ALL BUT OTHER SITES. I THINK IT WILL BE GROUNDBREAKING FOR HOW WE APPROACH PREVENTION IN THE FUTURE.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00187	SO I HAVE A FIGURE TO KIND OF HIGHLIGHT THIS HERE ULTIMATELY WHEN WE WANT TO THINK ABOUT RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS HOW IT DEVELOPS AND WHERE WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PREVENT WE WANT TO INTERVENE IN THE FUTURE

YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00209	MY BOSS MIKE HOLERS AND JILL NORRIS, HIS WIFE, HAVE DEVELOPED A LOT OF THESE EARLY STUDIES AND REALLY SET A FOUNDATIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00210	THE ORIGINAL STUDIES WERE UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF THE STUDIES OF THE EDIOLOGISTS. MY COLLEAGUE CHRISTOPHER STREUBEG AND OUR STATE COORDINATOR WHO HAS DRIVEN FORWARD A LOT OF THIS, MARIA FAZER, HAVE BEEN A HUGE HELP. KRISTEN DEMERAL, KRISTY KUHN,

YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00213	AND WITH THAT I WILL STOP AND LEAVE THE SLIDE AND ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS. I THINK STILL THE LAST TALK, RIGHT? I'VE GONE A LITTLE OVER BUT HOPEFULLY THERE'S TIME FOR QUESTIONS.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00215	IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS, PLEASE ENTER THEM IN THE CHAT.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00217	I think I can see the chat, but I can see it better if I stop share. So I'm going to stop sharing if that's all right.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00219	NATALIE MAYBE IF YOU CAN SEE I DON'T SEE ANY QUESTIONS IN THE CHAT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00220	I DON'T SEE ANY EITHER. I'M NOT MISSING ANYTHING.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00222	All right, I guess if nothing's coming through, are we done?
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00226	WHERE DO ISGS FIT INTO YOUR EVALUATIONS?
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00228	SO WHAT IS AN ISG
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00230	INTERFERON SIMULATED GENES CERTAINLY DON'T FIT INTO ANY CLINICAL ASSESSMENTS OR LABORATORY ASSESSMENTS TO DO NOW.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00231	THAT'S IT THERE IS A GROWING UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE MAY BE AN INTERFERON SIGNAL
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00232	IN THE EARLY PRE-RA PERIOD. YOU OPENED THE DOOR FOR A DISCUSSION HERE. WE DON'T THINK INTERFERON IS A HUGE PLAYER IN ESTABLISHED RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00233	BIOLOGICALLY IT LOOKED LIKE IT MIGHT BE FROM OLDER STUDIES INCLUDING SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION AND ACTUALLY ARTICULAR INFLAMMATION THAT INTERFERON MIGHT PLAY A ROLE. INTERFERON BLOCKADE DID NOT WORK WELL.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00234	.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00235	So this is part of that picture I showed where things we know work in established rheumatoid arthritis may actually be different than what we need to use in earlier disease.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00236	.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00237	THE CONCEPT IS THERE. WE'RE TRYING TO NOW UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT PATHWAYS ARE THERE TO BE ABLE TO TARGET THEM EFFECTIVELY.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00239	ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM ANYONE?
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00241	WELL, DR. DEAN, THANK YOU. I APOLOGIZE OUR MODERATOR COULDN'T MAKE IT TODAY, BUT WE APPRECIATE YOUR SPEAKING.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00243	THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. I THINK EVERYBODY HAS MY E-MAIL FROM CAMPUS IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS COME UP LATER. THANK YOU.
