YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00001	okay so let me introduce our 1st speaker who is stien van der ploeg
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00003	stien van der ploeg is the special projects advisor and wild animal initiative and also offers coaching and consulting the to new effective animal advocacy group
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00005	so right now i press the microphone to you seeing
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00007	thank you bianca thank you for carefully pronouncing my name i appreciate it
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00008	and monica too also thanks for hosting this i am sure you are very tired on this last day but from my perspective at least everything has gone very well these last 2 days
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00010	yeah so i will switch now to sharing my screen hopefully i can make that work
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00012	
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00014	let us see if you cannot see this can you signal okay great
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00016	so yeah i think you do not have to be a manager to lead
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00018	and i will try to explain to you why today
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00020	so hello everyone nice to see a whole bunch of familiar faces here i appreciate that you are using your sunday afternoon for some people sunday very early morning to be here to learn how you can better protect animals
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00022	i just finished a scifi novel about anarchy i am a product of colonialism i do not depend on my work for money and i have such issues with authority that i will not even follow recipe instructions
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00024	that is not my usual introduction to who seen from her purpose but i think it is helpful for you to know where i am coming from so you feel encouraged to listen to me with an open mind to why i think you can and should lead even if you are not a manager
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00026	i hope you will you will be skeptical not just of me but of all leadership strategies you learn about there are 1000000s of books and classes and podcasts about leadership
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00027	but the hard data available is pretty limited and on top of that your personal experience your cause the structure of your organization all influence what type of leadership works best in your situation and industry
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00029	to tell you a little bit more about my professional situation i have worked at various nonprofits over 15 years in fundraising administration operations
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00030	and i just started to work for wild animal initiative
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00032	at wild animal initiative my super smart and compassionate colleagues at this research institute work to understand and improve the lives of free ranging sentient animals
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00033	besides that work i offer project based support to new effective animal advocacy organizations as bianca said earlier i am lucky enough to do all my work for free without taking salary
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00035	so the ideas i will share with you today have largely been stolen from these books and a bunch of others and from articles and podcasts but also from various courses in classes
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00036	some directly about people management others about critical thinking effective altruism diversity and inclusion or negotiation but most importantly
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00038	i have learned from doing and i have learned from these people these are some of my colleagues at the various charities i have worked for
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00039	and you can maybe pick me out in all of these pictures but that might be a little bit difficult with how small the faces are
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00040	but yeah i have learned more from these people than i have from reading and training or from reading and training combined
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00041	i have learned from making mistakes from people is feedback and through osmosis being around people who lead and experiencing what works and what does not and from talking and listening to these people
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00042	in the center you also see me with my partner that was i am pretty sure on my 40th birthday he is a senior director at a software company
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00043	and i learn daily from his ideas ah from his successes and his challenges and he also gives me insight into how things are done in the corporate world which i have not had that much exposure to
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00045	so now you know how i learned the things i will share but what is it exactly that i hope you will learn
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00047	well i will not blow your mind with novel ideas i will share what i think are some common sense recommendations that you can try to turn into common practice
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00048	to me leadership is about the impact you can have on others irrespective of your authority in this talk i will go over 4 ways to influence others so you can do more
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00049	i will explain why i think you should question ideas plans assumptions and the behavior of your coworkers including your managers
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00051	inspire your colleagues and show them the difference they make
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00053	support your coworkers development and connect with your team so people feel like they belong these 4 pillars will strengthen your leadership i hate the word strengthen and i cannot ground it
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00055	ah afterwards i would like to ask you what you think and hear about your experiences and all the way at the end we should have time to go over your questions and slide
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00057	so why do i think you should lead
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00059	well this whole presentation rests for assumptions i have about you i think you want to help more animals you know some interventions and work methods are more effective than others
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00061	you want to feel valued like you make a difference and like you belong
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00063	you want your coworkers to feel the same so based on these assumptions i believe it is your responsibility to try to lead your team an organization in the direction that helps the most animals and those animals include your coworkers
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00065	it is not just your moral duty i think to stand up for what is right we must try to do the most good weekend
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00067	when you leave you will prevent burnout
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00069	phonollytics found people leave or animal organizations due to leadership and burnout
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00070	your leadership can improve team spirit create a trusting open and safe environment contribute to a known blame culture and show the difference your collective work is making
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00072	this will make it less likely that your people that you or the people on your team will suffer from mental and physical stress and exhaustion
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00074	you will help more animals
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00076	as you might have heard jamie say yesterday animal advocacy careers found c e 0 is and hiring professionals in effective animal advocacy organizations identified leadership as one of the most urgent skill gaps in our movement
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00077	so your leadership will make the movement more effective you can help fill those gaps
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00079	practicing leadership will also lead to personal growth
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00081	you gain more confidence you feel more in control and you strengthen not just your professional but also your personal relationships
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00083	but leading when you are not in management is not always easy some people might not appreciate what you do hierarchical organizations and managers stuck to their ways might label you difficult
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00085	but you will have to stand up for what is right you must take responsibility for how you and your colleagues are treated
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00087	and you can make a difference you can save more animals and you can probably experience more joy in your work than you think you can
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00089	so to get to the 1st ah point
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00091	question ideas plans assumptions and behavior
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00093	is normal in each of our countries to use animals as products to see mass things to kill and eat them you grew up and still live in a culture where few people questioned those arms but you did
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00094	it did not matter that most people follow to the customs of animal abuse you felt it was wrong did research and are working to change the status quo
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00096	you can use that same curiosity humility and compass a few moral compass of yours to make your organization more effective
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00098	maybe you do not like the performance refuse or how meetings are run or maybe you wonder why some specific tasks are important for animals to lead better lives is there evidence for that did someone test if this works best
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00100	the managers and executives in your organization might also not have the full picture or fully grasp what the day to day work on the ground is like your perspective is helpful in finding the best option
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00102	because of your position you might also be better at taking the lead on certain issues as someone without hierarchical authority you are not likely to be blinded by the power you have multiple studies are shown
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00103	that power and privilege influence one is ability to make evidence based decisions with an open mind
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00105	wisdom according to plato and a bunch of other people since then is knowing what you know and knowing what you do not know
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00107	it can be harder for the people in charge to know what they do not know you on the other hand might be better able to think critically how an operation system or a corporate campaign could work
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00109	and you must share that perspective so ask why repeatedly what is the purpose of what you are doing
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00111	knowing why something is important for the mission to succeed and how it works will make it easier for you to do it you asking questions will also make it easier for others to speak up why does this meeting lead to save more animals
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00112	why does this cage free strategy lead to less suffering why are these people on your governing board
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00114	when you dig into these wise you clarify the work for others
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00116	then be nosy and noisy or be curious and difficult
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00118	if you are the smart and silent type who fixes mistakes without confronting the error makers you actually are undermining organizational learning
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00119	if you think something could possibly be done better but you do not speak up you might say fewer animals so please be nosy and noisy
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00121	and do not forget to question your own ideas and action is what you are doing really the best way to get results how do you know maybe ask the opinion of someone who is willing to disagree with you
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00123	then inspire
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00125	how show people how the difference what the difference is that we can make together
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00127	funnels again great organization they found that dissatisfaction with a type of advocacy and not feeling like you make a difference are big reasons that people leave animal advocacy movement
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00129	you can reconnect people to their motivation you can help them see the impact they have by inspiring people you like them into action so together we can do it
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00131	1000000000s of farmed animals will continue to be murdered every year
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00133	we still know very little about the experiences of animals in the wild but alone about how to sustainably reduce their suffering those facts are bleak
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00135	but i am absolutely confident that we are building the roads towards the future in which humanity cares for animals the actions we take today can spare a vast number of animals a lifetime of suffering just years from now
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00137	so many fishes chickens tadpoles pigs i cannot even imagine they will have better lives
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00139	this difficult and much stands in our way but together we can build not just roads but rockets to a better future
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00141	i hope you remember this and remind each other when things get hard that our work makes a difference for real individuals
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00143	make the invisible clear spreadsheets make animals happier
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00145	sometimes we need to do things that seem far removed from protecting animals
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00147	filling out spreadsheets raising money creating budgets administration we are not all rescuing foxes from fur farms remind yourself and others how mundane tasks relate to a better world
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00148	when i compare last year is average donations to this year is that means i will have more information to raise more money next time
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00149	and with more money at wild animal initiative we can hire more researchers and learn more about how we can give animals the lives they prefer
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00151	be impatient for a better future we can make a difference and we must make a difference our work is not just important it is urgent
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00152	the more time and energy we waste the more animals will suffer the smarter we work the quicker we will find ways to help animals
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00154	remind each other of this and model that urgency
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00156	celebrate winds
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00158	big and small milestones must be celebrated no countless hens roaming in a barn without sunlight laying eggs without ever raising children is not good
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00159	but a switch to that from tiny cages means less pain it means more expensive eggs it means we are a step closer to liberation it is likely pass a test on the way to graduation it deserves a reward
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00161	and when you celebrate individual achievements make it specific do not just say a partner work day and night to create a beautiful vegan video
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00163	explain why that is an important step on the way to animal liberation even instead you say this video she worked on so hard will make it easier for a message to spread
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00164	for people to be inspired to eat better food thanks to a partner is work fewer animals will be killed for food
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00166	high that celebration not to the input the heart work but to the impact someone makes
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00168	make sure you feel good when you do good help others feel successful helping others feel successful will lead them to continue to want to do their critical work
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00170	visualize the peaceful world we want to live in and how we are getting there together
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00172	develop develop and grow other leaders i am not sure about you though i think you do too i want to grow i want to become a better person than i am today
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00174	i want to get better at protecting animals i cannot do that alone i need to learn from the people around me who have different perspective on the impact i make and who have different knowledge and experience
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00176	a leader actively takes on the role of supporting people to become their best selves
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00177	because not only does that mean you give someone the opportunity to be better it means the organization will be better at achieving its goals
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00179	and you do not have to be a manager to do this we each have some insights or abilities that others on our teams do not if you share those the felt you develop others
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00181	give feedback
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00183	positive feedback being explicit about how my action led to helping more animals is an incredible motivator
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00185	giving constructive feedback genuinely aimed at helping me be better that a specific and timely makes me think you believe i have greater potential
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00187	that you trust me enough to have challenging conversations for many the best reward is attention and i fully believe in positive reinforcement and leading by example
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00188	but ignoring unproductive behavior can mean robbing people of the opportunity to grow denying people a chance to improve in my opinion is shortsighted cowardice and selfish
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00190	individuals who believe their talents can be developed through hard work good strategies and input from others
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00192	they tend to achieve more than people with a more fixed mindset those who believe their talents are innate gifts and if we believe making mistakes is good as will show later today then we need feedback
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00194	share your knowledge i need access to knowledge so i do not waste time reinventing the wheel when you share books articles strategies and ideas with me i feel like you have the expectation i can grow
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00196	i admit that in the past i i might not have always shared knowledge so that i could remain the sole expert so that i could feel necessary
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00197	but the fear of becoming obsolete is one you must overcome leader share knowledge they do not hide it
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00199	they succeed when they help people become better than they are
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00201	model good behavior when i see someone successfully coach others communicate bad news transparently and with compassion or ask for comments and deal with critical feedback well i have examples to copy from
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00203	be aware of how your attitude and actions influence others perceptions of what is acceptable and good monkey see monkey do
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00205	share space
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00207	invite people to participate it does not come natural to everyone to speak up or to step into new situations but testing new things is important for my growth
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00208	when i am put in stretch opportunities and when i am invited to take up space that becomes easier
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00210	if there are people on your team who you know are capable of more than they have shown or who might have good ideas but do not usually speak up you can create openings for them to participate invite them in the conversation
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00211	you can help people get over their insecurity to get over that threshold of speaking up
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00213	say hey sarah did not you have a similar experience with x what is your perspective or ivan i have only heard from the usual but what are the questions you have on this topic
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00215	our success is highly independent on that of others
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00217	connect connect to create a supportive collection a collective ah your work can be emotionally taxing the cruelty
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00219	and suffering of animals seems endless our achievements are incremental
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00221	we need support to continue to do this work moreover it is critical to provide the psychological safety where people can openly talk about the things that went wrong and might go wrong
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00222	if you were not there on friday i recommend you watch anya is talk who spoke specifically about creating psychological safety
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00224	people will not share ideas if they do not feel they belong
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00226	create a collective of allies and here i am actually going to disagree a tiny bit with on you and christina who spoke on friday i do not think you need to be friends with the people you work with
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00228	we are less like a family and more like a sports team with a common goal friend groups can feel like clicks with outsiders
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00230	i think we need allies people you can depend on to help you do your best work who you hold accountable and who hold you accountable you have the most important connection with your colleagues you all want to help animals
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00232	i do not want you to listen to me because we have the same cultural background but because i have a good idea and i need you to be critical of my suggestions
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00233	and your opinion of them should not be colored by a mutual love for the music of joy division
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00235	we need to trust that when we disagree we do so because we want to get to a point of better understanding how we can improve lives we need relationships we can count on
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00237	to form a collective and network of allies but one on one relationships with people but more importantly support relationships between other people make introductions between people who could support each other or learn from each other
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00239	check in people do their best work when they feel a sense of belonging
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00241	to create that inclusion for many that means they need people to check in with them especially in times of crisis if you are a queer advocate in poland right now your identity your existence is basically threatened
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00242	doing your work now is even harder than normal show each other compassion
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00244	be kind and supportive see how other people are doing and not just the ones you naturally gravitate towards remember that you have what you have in common and show up for each other
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00246	speak up for each other in 2 ways 1st amplify voices especially marginalized ones if someone is not listened to because they are not included or because they are not as loud or as respected
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00247	you can repeat their and attribute their ideas to them this will make them feel hard and part of the team and better decisions can be made
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00249	then speak up for each other call them bad behavior when someone uses disrespectful language or shows their bias ask what they mean or explain why it can feel harmful
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00250	if you do not you give your silent approval and encourage an environment of harassment
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00252	you can help create a brave space of belonging where only people is ideas are judged not their identity
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00254	when i know you have my back it will be easier for me to speak up for myself and for others
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00256	if people feel they are happy in their place of work turnover is low and more people want to join your group
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00258	and you deliver better work as a collective than you do as a collection of individuals
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00260	so all these 4 things are connected each of the competencies support and reinforce each other
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00262	without asking questions without fully understanding why our methods are the best and how mundane tasks relate to the mission it is hard to inspire each other about our ability to change the world
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00263	and without inspiration without believing you can make a difference what interest do i have to develop and grow
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00265	and if you do not develop if you hoard your knowledge and do not invite people to participate it will be less likely to feel like they have a part that they are a part of a connected collective
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00267	and and without people feeling like they are connected and valued like they are judged on the validity of their ideas and not their character they will not feel free to question the strategy that the organization is taking
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00269	there are 4 skills listed in the center of circle communication critical thinking feedback and d e i stand for diversity equity and inclusion
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00271	learning about and practicing these core skills well help you get better at acting on the 4 leadership competencies around it each of these 4 skills deserve their own full task if not full day multi sessions
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00272	so i can not go over all of them here
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00274	but i do want to go over diversity equity and inclusion briefly because i think it is especially important for a movement now we must care about humans
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00276	research has shown we will not be as effective as organizations and as a movement without representation on our teams of the diversity of people
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00277	without people feeling like they belong and without everyone being equally likely to achieve success
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00279	so diversity to me means people with different identities and ways of thinking are represented equity people have what they need to thrive and inclusion people are heard and feel like they belong
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00281	i also believe that it is not just important for us to to be more effective in our animal advocacy i think it is our moral responsibility to create equity
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00282	if we are apathetic to injustice and do not stand up for people who might not be in the room we consent to the status quo of oppression
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00284	there are many forms of exclusion plague in our movement sexism ableism heteronormativity but i want to call out in particular anti blackness and the need to incorporate anti racism in our work
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00285	i recommend you seek out encompass movement to learn more about how to create racial justice in the animal advocacy space
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00287	also want to show you how i think that d e i these 3 concepts are important for the 4 competencies i discussed
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00289	questioning
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00290	numerous studies have shown that diversity on your teams can create a work culture that is better at making more informed decisions
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00292	because when you are all friends or like minded people it is very easy to get on the same smooth wavelength and produce ideas you each believe in
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00294	but it also means you are more likely to miss out on certain thoughts on the other hand when your team consists of people with very different life experience or different thinking patterns deciding on strategy might feel a bit more like a struggle
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00295	but ideas are considered from more angles
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00297	encouraging diversity both cognitive and identity based will encourage more questions
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00299	then inspire
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00301	we need to inspire everyone on our teams to deliver our best work it will be very hard to motivate people that we can fight this massive battle together if some are excluded and feel like they do not belong
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00303	develop
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00305	people of color and other marginalized persons are often less likely to succeed because they have less access to learning opportunities and mentorship well at the same time they are forced to live up to higher standards
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00307	connecting as a team member you can help create a sense of inclusion and without inclusion people will not feel free to share their ideas nor will people be open to listening to yours
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00308	learn to recognize the way bias influences behavior and how it seeps into organizational systems so you can change them
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00310	question yourself and listen to coworkers and people outside your community with an open mind
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00312	this will help you incorporate anti oppression in your leadership
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00314	without it we are less effective without it we will not have justice we are all animals
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00316	in summary
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00318	you can make an impact on your coworkers or and your organization and your mission irrespective of your authority
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00320	question how people and plans in your organization lead to better lives for animals ask critical questions about the direction of your organization
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00322	inspire the people you work with show them the difference your heart work together makes for animals
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00324	develop others ability to make impact support them in their growth and connect build relationships and make sure individuals feel like they belong
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00326	so
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00328	that is the majority of all i wanted to share with you today so what is left is some questions i have for you hoping that we can all learn from each other is experience
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00329	feel free to type in the chat box or to unmute yourself to share your thoughts and i have 3 questions for you and once we have gone through them
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00330	ah there should be time for your slide out questions so which one of my ideas will you try out
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00332	and i am going to remain uncomfortably quiet until someone speaks up for chats up bianca or monica if you are still here ah could you help me read that if there is any chats
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00334	okay everyone so i just want to encourage you as seen has said before to answer her questions in the chat or if you have any questions you can ask those slide out
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00336	and look at says boicing concerns or questions even more actively
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00338	the p s s or it will write in the chat repeat think quiet people is ideas and attributing them to that person
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00340	celebrate small victories for the animals more
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00342	to support other people is growth
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00344	make you says he is going to try celebrating small mile milestones and giving people feedback
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00346	so see what time is okay
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00348	then next question which from one of my ideas will be challenge for you or maybe what are some ideas that you do not agree with
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00350	that you think i should change my mind about
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00352	i do not see anyone that would write something right now in the group chat but maybe it is not that challenging
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00353	yeah
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00355	maybe for example for me a lot of the most challenging things are for example prevent the burnout and
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00357	well doing most of these things and engage every day okay and we have the 1st given more from from natally given more feedback is challenging but very important
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00359	then from thomas
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00361	i think you can be too annoying it can slow a process if everyone is critical of everything all the time
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00363	then mariana
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00365	exactly feedback is definitely the most challenging
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00367	yeah i have to agree with that i think for me also both giving and receiving feedback is difficult and there is a lot to learn for that
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00369	then last question something that in the questionnaire or i think the survey
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00370	that animal advocacy careers did a lot of c e 0 is and leaders said that communication is a super important management skill or a leadership skill
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00371	but that can mean a 1000000 things from like being good at speaking externally or delivering nice presentations but ah what does it mean to you to communicate well as a leader
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00373	okay so again we have some more comments from tania good communication all comes down to listening
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00374	and then from ah ishita i i did not know if i pronounced the name right but i hope so ah not just hearing but also understanding what someone has to say
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00375	then from mika positioning yourself at the same level as others
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00377	natalie have a really clear purpose being able to explain why we are doing certain things
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00379	and from lina that there are no misunderstandings
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00381	i think those are all very great points
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00382	yeah i think so too
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00384	those were all the questions i have for you and besides all the books i have read and the many more i still want to read
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00385	i think ah anya again sorry i keep calling you out if you are here you also had some great book recommendations and i think many others do too
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00386	and these are some other sources that i have mentioned or that you can find online to read more about leadership practices and especially do not forget your coworkers
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00002	hi i am pete sinden chief information officer at genomics england and today i am here to discuss how research is being used to deliver personalized care
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00004	genomics is a groundbreaking area of medicine it uses a person is unique genetic code to help diagnose treat and prevent illness
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00005	advanced technology now let scientists compare genetic code across 1000s of people to make new discoveries and continually improve improve health care
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00007	jessica is a 4 year old girl she has a rare genetic condition that causes epilepsy and affects on movement and general development
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00008	throughout the early years of her life she has been given m r i is lumber punctures e e g is to measure brainwaves and many other diagnostics none of which revealed her particular condition
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00010	through the 100000 genome project jessica received a diagnosis genomics pinpointed a change to one of her genes that was not present in either of her parents they now know that jessica has glute one deficiency syndrome
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00011	she does not produce enough of the protein that transport glucose from the blood to the fluid around the brain
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00013	jessica can now control her epilepsy by adopting a special ketogenic diet lowing carbohydrates and haemprotein
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00014	this understanding directly improved the life of a child and applying the process at scale can improve the lives of many children and adults alike
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00016	furthermore the parents now know that the condition was not inherited if they decide to have more children they will not have the same condition essential for their peace of mind
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00018	rare disease is very common
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00020	well each disease is individually rare there are over 7000 rare diseases
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00022	collectively once one of 17 people has a rare disease and that represents over 400000000 people globally
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00024	80% rare diseases have a genetic cause patients will wait on average 4 years for diagnosis and 95% of them will have no approved treatments
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00026	this is an area of medicine with a significant potential for advancing science and improving lives this is why rare disease was a major focus of 100000 genome project for which genomic symptom was originally established
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00028	investment in research to further understand and treat these conditions is critical and high impact genomics england sets the half of the u k is ecosystem in enabling genomic research and making genomics clinically accessible
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00029	we work alongside friends in the u k medical family from n h s england to biobank h d r u k and n i h r
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00030	our systems are used by several 1000 academic researchers by biotech and biopharma
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00032	we have deep technical and genomic specialist partnerships with a lot of a w s lifebit illumina congenica nvidia and oxford nanopore
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00034	we exist in part through central government funding and in part through research funding
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00036	genomics england is a key facilitator in the transition to personalized predictive and preventative genomic health care
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00038	we work with the n h s to deliver and improve genomic testing that helps doctors diagnose treat and prevent illness starting with cancer and rare disease
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00039	a minimum of 20000 whole genome sequences are expected to be processed during 2021
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00041	at the same time we provide health data and advanced technology needed by researchers to make new medical discoveries and develop more effective targeted medicines for patients and their families
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00043	together these 2 hearts of the infinity leap reinforce each other advances in research can be incorporated into clinic care
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00045	patients receiving clinical care can consent to be included in research data to support medical advances in doing this we create a virtuous circle
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00047	this slide shows that genomics does not just apply to rare disease this slide relates to cancer
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00049	in this instance an individual presented with a brain tumor but the clinicians suspected the brain tumor was not the primary source of the cancer by analyzing tumor mutation burden which is a measure of the mutations in the d n a of the cancer cells
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00050	it was possible to identify that the primary source was likely colorectal lung or malignant melanoma
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00052	by further the analyzing transversions a process whereby c basis or changed a basis in the genomic code it was possible to show that the likely cause was d n a damage from inhaling benzopyrene benzopyrene is a carcinogen have in cigarette smoke
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00054	by using these 2 techniques together the primary disease type was identified as lung cancer and in this instance it was treatable with immunotherapy stimulating the immune system to kill the cancer cells
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00057	through the 100000 genome project over a 110000 genomes have been contributed by approximately 90000 participants for research purposes
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00058	over 70000 of those get the rare disease from the individuals effective and the majority of cases from their family members
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00059	over 17000 cancer patients have contributed both germline and tumor sequences over the last year individuals have also contributed genomes to help understand covid 19 and the variation in severity of the disease
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00060	this is building to injured an additional 35000 genomes
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00062	the genomic data sits alongside clinically relevant data to a rhythm which phenotypic genotypic environment for detailed analysis
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00063	clinical data includes hospital episode statistics mortality data a range of cancer specific information and exit questionnaires from clinicians indicating for example whether specific variance could explain the phenotype
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00065	in some instances imaging and primary care data are also linked
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00067	this slide it shows there is a spread of genomes between rare disease types there are significant numbers relating to neurological development disorders along with many other classes of disease
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00069	when logged into our research environment these can be explored and segmented in many ways to find the right cohort of participants for your particular study
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00071	on this slide shows the spread of participants by cancer type as expected you see greater numbers of the more prevalent breast colorectal and lung cancers cancer patients cover both somatic mutations those that occur from damage to genes
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00072	in an individual during the person is life and germline mutations those that are passed on directly from a parent to a child at the time of conception
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00074	following the successful completion of 100000 genome project genomics england has undergone a transformation for project to platform our next chapter involves working with patients doctors and scientists to improve the genomic testing in the n h s
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00075	and help researchers access the health station and technology they need to make new medical discoveries and create more effective targeted medicines for everybody
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00077	the more genomes are analyzed the more discoveries can be made and the best of future can would be our transition from self managed infrastructure to a w s cloud is an essential enabler in scaling our offering to enable such research
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00079	researchers can access the genomic and clinical data outland above by using genomic england is trusted research environment gel has partnered with innovative british deep tech company lifebit and is using global cloud provider a w s to power the platform
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00080	the platform provides immediate access to tooling required to define and explore a cohort of individuals based on genop genomic or phenotypic stratification
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00081	the platform enables data exploration and makes it simple for researchers to execute pipelines and other jobs
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00083	researchers can introduce cutting edge analytical tools of their choice through docker containers link those tools securely with their own data
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00084	and conduct research across all data sources in private workspaces that are all audited protected and controlled by gel is strict information governance policies
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00086	but why use a research environment
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00088	in addition to protection of individual privacy there are 4 key reasons to use the trusted research environment firstly the data sets involved are enormous
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00089	the data is too big to move efficiently it cannot readily be achieved with a sensible timeframe or cost as the data grows this becomes an ever increasing constraint
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00090	but where the example when genomic symptom moved its own data from one storage system to another it took many months for the full copy
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00092	secondly technology now makes it relatively simple to bring the analytics to the data increasing speed and lowering cost this is becoming a common paradigm for distributed analysis of very large data sets
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00094	through lifebit cloud 0 s each researcher receives their own clean room environment separate to any other from which they can access all of the genomics england is data alongside their own data
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00095	the fully managed service provides maximum utility without sacrificing security or control
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00097	thirdly investing in hardware and establishing environment is a drag on innovation it is not a good use of time for data scientists or by informaticians
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00099	and lastly the common environment enables ready collaboration between research teams while each has their own environment they have the ability to collaborate wherever they wish
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00101	cloud bring significant opportunities to research
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00103	you can begin rapidly with no need to purchase install or manage hardware by piggybacking on an established research environment you can scale research immediately with all security identity management and data ingestion readily and ready and waiting
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00105	a well governed cloud platform is more secure than self managed infrastructure
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00106	a pay as you go model means you only need to pay for what you use
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00107	federation of data becomes simpler integrating data securely federation across environments is a critical direction of travel and we fully support the efforts of the j for j community
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00109	the cloud provides significant 119 resilience this allows us to develop more effort into enabling genomic research over managing platform stability
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00111	and in a world where genomics is at the bleeding age of high performance compute we can always benefit from the latest available technology without being concerned with capital investment and depreciation lifecycles
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00113	while the benefits of cloud are undeniable there is a journey to setting up a high functioning analytics platform genomics england we have made the investment so that you do not need to
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00114	some challenges that we have had that we have addressed are such
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00116	high performance computing is a specialized end computing with help of intel and a w s we tackle the performance and configuration questions head on
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00118	intel support enabled us to embed architectural changes from which all users now benefit
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00120	we looked at several classes of common jobs a simple g was a standard genomic function so a 5 fold improvement in speed and a 10 fold reduction in cost
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00122	on an out of the box configuration a complex but frequent job took 25 hours to run
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00123	after our investment we were able to reduce the compute time from 25 hours to 23 seconds this is a generic improvement for all such workloads
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00125	this investment that we put in alongside of partners matters for all future research and costs research are based on instance type selected and compute time used
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00127	migrating existing services is a non trivial matter through a close partnership with a w s migration assistance program we have planned to move complex independent services running over nearly 1000 virtual machines
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00129	our final challenge is the funding model while commercial entities see the benefit of pay as you go services the academic grant funding mechanism is less ready for the concept we are looking to see how to best manage that with our partners through the operating model and potentially with centralized funding
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00131	to wrap up we are now at a point where we have proven the value in genomic analysis and seeing whole g m sequencing being embedded in clinical pathways
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00132	through a year of covid genomics has entered the common language the next phase is scaling with more data we can collectively conduct more analyzes and generate new personalized therapeutics diagnostics and preventative treatments
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00133	the potential global impact is enormous our environments are established not so that we can conduct research but so that you can
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00134	if you would like to get involved please do contact us via partnerships genomicsengland co uk more information can be found by following the q r code
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00135	we welcome collaborations with academia biotech farmer and others other interested in using genomics to turn science into health care using technology
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00137	thank you for your time
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00002	alright i am going to get rid of the meeting controls really quickly too
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00004	alright hi guys i am emma
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00005	i am emily
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00006	and we are from pit dance marathon and today we are going to talk a little bit about implementing effective stewardship for your dance marathon
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00008	so in our presentation we will talk about ah the 2 pronged approach that we take at p d m ah to donor stewardship including stewarding as an organization and stewarding as for individuals
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00009	and some examples of both of those and what we did in our program this year and then ways that other dance marathons can implement them and those methods into their programs in the future
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00011	so we take a 2 pronged approach to
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00013	stewarding in terms of that from an individual point of view and that from an organizational standpoint
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00014	so in terms of individual stewardship this refers to the resources and plans that are implemented for participants and staff members to use where they themselves are encouraged to thank those who have donated to their fundraising efforts
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00015	so this includes templates and outlines that we provide to every individual involved in p d m to send out once they receive donations from different individuals
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00016	and then organizational stewardship which refers to the stewarding efforts that are done on behalf of all of pit dance marathons
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00017	so this includes emails that are sent out from p d m to all donors 2 specific categories of donors that sort of thing
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00019	you are probably wondering why we do this in the 1st place and really it is because it covers up all of the bases so some people donate because they are supporting the person that is raising the money
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00020	but other people may donate because they really just want to support the cause no matter who the fundraiser is
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00021	so for money donors it is a combination of the 2 so using this 2 pronged approach changes the form of thank you that will be most effective for each individual donor
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00022	so those that donated to support the individual fundraiser will typically feel more touched and appreciated whenever that person reaches out to them directly
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00023	whether it is an email a text thank you card anything like that
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00024	but those that are more attached to the entire cause of dance marathons will really appreciate the acknowledgement of their contribution from the entire organization
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00025	appreciating the overall thank you as well as any updates from the organization or new information we can provide them following their donation
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00026	this also helps disperse the responsibility and the workload of stewardship because it encourages individual staff members and participants to make the efforts of thanking their donors
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00027	so that the stewardship chair or committee or whatever you may have at your dance marathon is not as responsible for sending out individuals text messages or thank yous to each single donor
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00028	this would not be as effective anyway because whoever is in charge of stewardship will not know each and every donor as well as each fundraiser will so this makes it way more impactful and personalized
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00030	so focusing on stewarding as an organization ah one of the main ah goals and main items into terms of stewarding as an organization is the high level of consistency in organizational skills
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00031	that it requires because of the quantity of individuals groups and companies to be thanked so depending on the size of your dance marathon there are 100s or 1000s of donors in a given year
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00032	which is an extremely large list of names to keep track of and stay on top of thinking so we found that it is super important to create and maintain a robust list of donors by pulling frequent reports from donor drive to keep track of all of the donors
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00033	so we we typically find it most useful to organize these donors into different categories
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00034	and create different excel spreadsheets and that sort of things based on different characteristics such as those who have donated multiple times those who have donated over a $100 different kind of characteristics like that
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00035	and so it is extremely helpful in breaking all of this down to keep track of each individual is different contributions and then creating this robust list that you maintain and can source from donor drive
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00036	easily allows you to personalize emails that will be going to a group so even though it is just the organization sending a mass email so to speak so you still will be sending an email to maybe a few 100 people at one time
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00037	it is more specific in terms of acknowledging who are acknowledging exactly what they donated
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00038	and gave it to the cause so for example if you break it down into who donated $50 who donated donated $100 who donated 2 to $200 etc
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00039	this gives you smaller cohorts of donors so you can provide them information on how much their donation will support ah the children is hospital or or children is miracle network for example so
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00040	you can include more personalized details such as as a donor of over $50 you were able to provide x to a child at the hospital
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00041	and this in general just gets the more connected to the cause and allows them to see what type of impact their donations are having
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00042	and again it is just a way to make it a little bit more personalized while still being able to send it out to large coercive donors
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00044	and what is most important is to get creative the more creative that your organization can get in ways of thanking and stewarding donors the more exciting it is for those donors
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00045	they do not necessarily just want an email that says thank you for donating to our dance marathon they really like unique things it helps them feel more appreciated and more recognized
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00046	so personalizing emails for different groups like this is one of the easiest ways to improve on the mass email method as well as sending virtual postcards or thank you cards to those who have donated a lot of money to you
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00048	work with your marketing team or whoever may be in charge of graphics on your team to create cute designs and interesting concepts
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00049	maybe they tie into your overall branding as an organization or you are a campaign or if you had a theme for your push day anything like that it really helps to elevate the stewardship materials
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00051	so one of our biggest initiatives at p d m this year for stewardship was our stewardship spotlights during our dance marathon
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00052	so once an hour there was a slot of a few minutes set aside for prepared stewardship shout outs where we would get on stage and recognize and applaud some of our top donors
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00053	so this came in the form of thanking all of the businesses that donated to our organization in any way over the past year thanking and shouting out highest fundraisers of the hour day year and so on
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00055	so we did this to dedicate explicit time during all of the craziness and fun happening during our main event to thank everybody who made a big impact on the reveal at the end of the day
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00057	we wanted to incorporate these spotlights after performers so that way there would be a large crowd by the stage so that more and more people could recognize our donors and the people that made our fundraising possible
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00059	during these times we even called up certain people to the stage to applaud and thank them if they were at our event
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00060	as well as inviting representatives from the businesses that had donated to us to come to our event so they could be recognized on the stage
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00062	now switching over to the 2nd prong of individual stewardship
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00063	so individual stewardship is always a bit difficult we have found in terms of actually getting people outside of staff members to use the resources that are provided
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00064	and take the time and effort to properly properly steward recognize and thank their donors so we found that creating templates in email drafts and text examples is great but if not many people actually use them it kind of defeats the point
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00065	so this year one of our main goals in terms of stewardship for our dance marathon was to increase participant stewardship so to try to get as many participants as possible not just staff members to thank those
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00066	that had donated to them
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00068	and so reported them in meaningful ways so this involved not only figuring out how to distribute resources but how to get participants to use the resources that we had created as well
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00069	so the idea main idea for individual stewardship in trying to achieve this goal in this effort was creating and implementing what we called a stewardship matrix
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00070	so essentially this was a chart that gave a recommendation of what stewarding effort or method the individual should use to thank a donor dependent on the amount that the person donated
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00071	so for example if a person donated over $100 we suggested and gave the individual resources to send those people a virtual thank you card
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00072	so the thought behind this was really that it was a clear if we gave a clear cut simple guideline and method for people to follow it would provide a bare minimum in a sense that people would be encouraged to follow
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00073	because almost all of the work was done for them if it was laid out
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00074	based on who to send what to based on their amount of donations and so obviously if they wanted to do more than what we had on the matrix that was wonderful and encouraged but the hope was that individuals would see the provided
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00075	and participants would see the provided instructions and guidance and follow it
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00077	so our next slide is an example of our matrix this was our matrix during a fundraising push day that we had in the spring
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00078	the matrix was easily modifiable depending on the event or situation that we were using it for but this is an example for the spring push day
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00079	so as you can see it gives guidance on what stewardship methods to tick ah depending on how much a donor ah donated to them
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00080	and along along with this we had ah all of the resources ah linked in the matrix so that people could easily go find the email text and send it right away
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00081	or ah instructions for virtual thank you cards with the link all of that sort of thing everything extremely prepared
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00082	so that people could use the simple guidelines and not require much effort to hopefully increase their participation in our stewardship efforts
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00084	so in terms of distribution like we mentioned distributing the individual stewardship materials is a very part very important part of the plan and for this we teamed up with the marketing and recruitment panels of our organization
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00085	so whoever is in charge of the communication between participants or creating the different graphics and materials that you put out on social media that sort of thing
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00086	is who we would recommend working with for this part of the plan
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00087	so we had our recruitment team send out the material in our participant emails while having marketing sharing the information on social media so posting the material in advance of the event
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00088	as well as during the day of so giving constant and easy access to everything a person could need for thanking their donors
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00089	so we had marketing repost examples of people using the methods outlined in the matrix on the instagram story throughout the day which is a reminder for people to thank their donors and again the resources were right there on social media
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00090	or in their email inbox or group me or whatever method you may use
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00091	and we just kept encouraging throughout the day to remember to use the provided materials that we had given that were clear cut right there for
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00093	so in terms of success this was by no means a 100% successful effort there were still people that did not necessarily take the initiative to thank their donors even with
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00094	this these templates but we did see a very significant increase in the number of participants that were stewarding their donors
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00095	we also received amazing feedback from participants that they used the matrix because it was easy to use and did not take a lot of time or effort on their part
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00096	they also commented that they really appreciated all the stewarding materials being found in one location so that way all of it was easy to access easy to locate and easy to come back to to thank their donors next time as well
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00098	so now in terms of implementing what we did this year at p d m into other programs nothing that we did in terms of stewardship at p d m this year was super specific to our program
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00099	meaning that it can easily be replicated and utilized and adapted and in other dance marathon programs so for example with a studentship matrix it can definitely be tailored to whatever your program
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00100	needs and whatever so like you can put in your organization is favorite form of stewardship previous templates that you have created using as an organization tool in that way
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00101	and tailor it more specifically to your organization that way and if you have a lot of donors who donate high amounts of money for example you can alter the matrix to reflect this in making it go to higher levels versus
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00102	ours during like push days where we had just a general 249 plus category so if you have lots of donors who donate larger amounts of money you can continue to provide guidance for higher amounts of donations
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00103	and then in terms of stewardship spotlights they are also a super easy but effective way to recognize thank and applaud some of the highest donors and this can be easily done during any of your dance marathons like your main events
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00104	just setting aside a few minutes an hour or however your organization wants to do it it is it is easy to set aside especially when you are doing it right from the beginning to set aside a few 5 minute segments throughout the day
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00105	for someone to get up on stage and acknowledge the top donors important companies all that sort of thing
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00107	so just in general focusing on stewardship and organization and and organizational stewardship will help to cover all of the bases in thanking your donors because it is much better for them to receive thank yous from individuals
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00108	and the organization rather than receive a thank you from no one just is its better to thank them at multiple points throughout the year as compared to not thanking them a single time
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00109	so that was kind of the motivation behind our stewardship efforts this year and i think that you can take a lot of the different methods that we utilize
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00110	and easily adapts them and adjusts them to fit the needs of your program and your participants and your donors
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00112	just to wrap it up make sure that you got the main points of our presentation and what we have done and what you could implement remember to focus on individual and organizational stewardship
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00113	get so creative as creative as you can get as many people from your organization involved come up with ways to steward donors and make them feel as appreciated as possible because we really do appreciate all that they do
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00114	and then focus on stewarding all donors no matter how much money they donate whether you are canning and they put ¢25 in
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00115	or it is somebody who donated a $1000 or more make sure that all donors feel appreciated because everything they do makes a big difference for our organizations
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00117	yeah that is our presentation if you have any questions at all please feel free to reach out to us you can find us at pit underscore p d m on instagram
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00118	d m us if you have any questions or d m us if you want to see how we are steward stewarding our donors this year thank you thank you
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00002	so why twitter this is a good question there are 1000000s of twitter users
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00004	and a lot of times they will be different from your facebook database so you could be reaching new potential people
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00005	it is kinda an interesting platform because you only have a 140 characters to tell your story so you have to be short you have to be brief
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00006	it is where a lot of people will come to share their experiences provide feedback and where they are looking to get customer service
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00007	and a lot of times we will get questions on twitter like i am having trouble with the volunteer department what can i do well and i mean we can give them the email address to our volunteers
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00008	and try to help them as best we can
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00010	how does twitter work as i mentioned it is up to fourty characters per tweet that includes all punctuation and spaces
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00011	and if you want to include a picture in your tweet that also takes up room so
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00012	short and sweet as kind of the end game for twitter and
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00014	the messages that you write which are also known as tweets are public and you can create a private profile if you want to do that personally
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00015	i would definitely not recommend that for an organization you would want to do something public
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00017	and the other thing that is cool about twitter is it is similar to facebook as in you can do it on your computer you can be on your phone and check updates
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00018	it can be on your ipad it is just one of those cool apps that you can check from anything
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00020	these are some of the twitter key terms i am not going to read through all of them but i may reference some of these
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00022	the main thing retweet the r t is something that is really important that is might be something that you would be interested in doing is sharing content from someone else
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00023	so a p a could retweet a message from best friends
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00024	maybe we are talking about maybe it is one of our blog posts that is talking about why it is important to adopt versus
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00025	buying tryna think what our recent blog posts have been can not think of any
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00027	but you can share content from another page which is pretty cool
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00029	and then i mentioned hashtags for facebook hashtags are very popular on twitter so wherever you can try to fit in those hashtags
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00030	on twitter we try to use hashtag save them all a lot and we will also monitor that hashtag to see who is using it to see if there are conversations that we can join
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00031	any questions we can respond to or just kind of keep an eye on you know what people are saying about save them all cause that is our our motto
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00032	you can also check hashtags like adopt or adopt do not shop
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00033	and just see you know what people are talking about kinda engage with a general conversation and which is always interesting and you can always jump in and respond to people and engage that way
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00035	and then as i mentioned since there are only a 100 and fourty characters it is really important to shorten your links
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00036	to make sure that they will fit within a tweet and we use bit ly as best friends
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00037	it is a free tool it is very cool you can also customize your links we use bit ly for facebook as well because it tracks how many people click through
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00039	very useful
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00041	twitter is relatively easy to sign up for you just fill out a profile and include a picture generally that is going to be your organization is logo
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00042	they kind of have this new cool layout that they have introduced in the past year so it is almost like a cover photo they are tryna make it look more like facebook essentially
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00043	but one when we go through it you can see there is like a cover photo area and then a
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00045	your twitter icon as well
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00047	tweeting tips same thing as facebook as far as content people like links to interesting stories they like blog posts deals
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00048	you can get away with a little bit more cheekiness on twitter than you can on facebook just be a little funny that is kind of more of the platform and the people that are on it
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00050	and a cool thing that has been doing really well on twitter is if you actually just
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00051	use twitter dot com we use hootsuite to manage our twitter account but if you go to twitter dot com you can upload a photo within your tweet
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00052	and it makes your tweet much bigger on the twitter newsfeed and it just looks really cool it is very visual so if you have a good photo you can include in a tweet
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00053	definitely do that the only problem being that a photo will take up characters so
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00054	kinda got to be aware of that so if you are doing a photo and a link then you are not going to have very many characters to actually
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00056	switch cap
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00058	so the question is how valuable is twitter and managing like a smaller group of about a 1000 volunteers and i would say it is not very valuable
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00059	valuable for you i would say for the organization overall it is nice to have a twitter presence if you have the time and resources
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00060	to manage it if you are concerned about time and resources i would definitely say that facebook is number one that is number one for us it continues to be number one for
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00061	most animal lover organizations instagram is another cool
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00063	cool cool tool that people are using and that is something that has grown immensely for us as well and that takes a little less time than twitter i would say for twitter to be
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00064	valuable and successful for you there has to be time spent on it
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00065	so time spent finding cool content and sharing it time spent responding to people time spent tracking hashtags and seeing you know what the conversations are
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00066	there is just there is a lot of engagement on twitter and you know there is a lot of engagement on facebook as well and that is something that can help make your page a success but for twitter that is
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00067	that is another one of the things you definitely can not just talk at people you talk to people and that is what the twitter audience expects if you are going to be present on twitter
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00069	so best practices relationship building is key listen for comments about you respond to comments and queries you can also do a search
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00070	so not only can you see people who are tweeting directly to you or mentioning you but you can do a search for your organization
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00071	and see where else you are mentioned where people might not even realize that you are active on twitter
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00072	you can ask lots of questions on twitter that is one of those things where if there is like a trending
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00073	like the other day it was national love your pet day or something like that so we posted a cute picture
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00074	of a dog giving a kiss to one of our caregivers and then just asked you know it is national love your pet day with the hashtag how are you celebrating or show us how you are celebrating
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00075	so twitter is a great way to kind of build engagement like that where it is just general questions you can ask your audience and and get them to respond to you and
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00076	engage with you and kind of kind of build your brand that way
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00078	we can also retweet messages you would like to share which i mentioned and i can show you how to do that when we get to the live drive
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00080	and the other thing about twitter is that it is very real time people will respond quickly and they will expect you to respond quickly
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00081	you know 24 hours or less is kind of our go to on twitter
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00082	we we try to be very quick we pretty much try to respond to anyone who tweets us within an hour on weekdays during business hours
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00083	you know after hours are one thing and weekends are another thing and we do monitor and respond on weekends as well
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00084	but where there is definitely an expectation that if you are active on twitter then you should be active and you should be responsive
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00086	okay the question is yeah so the question is why is an average person on twitter the answer is because people like to talk about themselves
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00088	yeah it is narcissism you know twitter is a microblog essentially
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00089	so gives you a 100 and fourty characters to say what you ate for breakfast or say that you just worked out 0 people love to share their workouts
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00091	crossfitters especially like to talk about their workouts
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00092	they like to share photos again you know same thing with instagram it is just sharing photos people like to share
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00094	what they want about their lives with others and they want to get feedback and they want to feel validation so yeah
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00096	yeah so the question is would twitter be a valuable recruiting tool
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00097	if you are tryna find volunteers and i would say it definitely could be if you can take the time to monitor conversations and insert yourself
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00098	and then wherever you can you know respond to people that are in your area talking about working out you know if you have a cool program like the jog a dog program here awesome is awesome
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00099	if you have a program like that and you have a presence on twitter and you can reach out to people you can absolutely use it that way
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00101	people people really like
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00102	the activity and that kind of you know the constant feedback i think that is what people look for on twitter is you know that immediate gratification and a response right there
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00104	yeah the question is when we launched our instagram did we see a decrease on twitter like was there any cannibalism and i would say there is not instagram overall has a very young audience
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00106	very young which is kinda cool cause you know you are reaching new people and instagram is a place where you can post a little bit
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00108	different content more you know but behind the scenes funny photos with funny captions
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00109	it allows for a little bit more creativity and just cause it is the nature of that channel and then you can also again utilize hashtags on instagram to get your photos seen by more people
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00111	no we did not see any drop yeah yeah our twitter continues to grow
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00113	and we do not really do advertising on twitter we have done it a couple times but i can not think of you know more than a handful of times that we
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00115	done actual paid advertising on twitter here i am going to actually pull up the twitter
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00117	this is our best friend is twitter account
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00119	so this is that cover photo that i was talking about this is the icon
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00121	sprout social has a very cool resource it is a guideline for social media image sizes i would highly recommend checking it out it tells you the sizes needed
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00122	for images on facebook like the ideal image size to post on facebook is like 1200 by a 1000 pixels sprout social
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00123	it is a social media image guideline and if you google it it will come up and it is actually in a google spreadsheet
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00124	so it is constantly updated but it tells you exactly what image sizes you need which is really great it tells you you know your facebook cover photo facebook events
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00125	facebook timeline facebook advertising twitter instagram instagram is like 20 fourty 8 by 20 fourty 8
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00126	i think but twitter the ideal size is longer it is like 800 by 400 or something so
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00127	there are a lot of varying image sizes and if you can get you know the ideal for whatever you are posting it is going to
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00129	show off the best that is definitely
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00131	yeah absolutely thank you
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00133	so this is our twitter account
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00135	these are our tweets
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00136	you can on twitter pinned to the top of your profile page the same way that you can on your facebook page
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00137	that is a newer feature that they rolled out when they did this kind of new layout again you know twitter trying to be more like facebook
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00139	you can see so like this tweet here had 20 retweets that is what this little these little arrows are and this favorite here and 14 favorite
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00141	
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00143	this is something that we retweeted
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00145	this is what the national love your pet day and this did really well that was one a 129 people favourited it which for twitter is kinda a lot for us
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00147	and you can see i showed you this post on our facebook page as well and the images are completely different sizes so this is optimized for twitter versus the one that was optimized for facebook
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00149	and as you can see
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00151	on the feed it shows up and looks really nice so you know this is a lot more likely to catch your eye than just this
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00153	so we try to do that whenever we can
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00155	you can also see who you are following followers one thing cool about followers is it shows you verified followers as well and verified
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00156	accounts are normally either organizations or celebrities or brands with a certain amount of followers
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00157	so these are just some of ours none of these are famous to me e online there we go
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00159	so this is our home
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00161	page for twitter
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00163	so this is the timeline of
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00165	these are all people that we follow right here so that is what is showing up in our feed
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00167	and as you can see
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00169	i mean people are super super active on twitter there is a lot to keep up with you could definitely post a lot more often on twitter than you can on facebook just because the lifespan of a tweet
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00170	is much much shorter than the lifespan of a facebook post so you have a lot more leeway to post
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00171	i mean we try to get out 5 to 7 tweets a day versus 2 facebook posts a day
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00172	and that does not include the tweets that we have responding to people and and monitoring hashtag
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00174	you can set that up i would not advise setting that up because
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00176	0 hello
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00178	wonderful live tweeting example i would not recommend linking your facebook to your twitter because there are such different platforms
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00179	that if you do a facebook post and link it to twitter it is going to get cut off it is going to be shortened and people will have to click through to facebook to look at it you want to post content that is
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00180	crafted for twitter crafted for people to be able to see the whole thing at once
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00182	so this is very cool this shows all the retweets the people that follow us mentions
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00184	dealing with trolls
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00186	and able to yeah and like we can take a look at the hashtag ampa 2015 and see look at all these people are talking about it
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00188	which is very cool
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00190	and so i am sure you are following the hashtag and then responding to these people so great way to engage even though they are not necessarily tagging american pets live on twitter they are using the hashtag
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00191	so you can still respond with them and kinda create a conversation and let them know you know you are paying attention to what they are saying
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00193	the other thing that is cool about using this you can do verified users so again those are like the more the
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00002	so next up we have doctor wenzhong xiao ah he leads the harvard m e c f s collaboration ah with doctor ron tompkins
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00003	he is ah associate professor at in surgery in bioinformatics at harvard medical school and n m g h
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00004	he is a member of the scientific advisory board at 0 m f he directs the m g h inflammation and metabolism computational center and he also leads the computational genomics group at stanford
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00005	as well so he is a very busy man he is going to talk about the open data sharing platform thank you very much wenzhong
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00007	thank you everyone for coming we are little bit short of time so i will i will try to go through the slides quickly and okay and by 345 to be on schedule
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00009	for the next 10 to 15 minutes i am going to talk about what data available on the website that is of of the medicine foundation and what we are
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00010	working with collaborators and practically everyone in the research community to look at this data and what has been done and what is in the works
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00011	so as we have heard quite a few talks this afternoon about science behind c f s and we know that as complex disease
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00012	the many potential reasons ah as causes of m e c f s from genes to infections to the environment so in order to
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00014	find the potential causes of c f s and perhaps more importantly find the treatment of patient we actually have to look
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00015	everywhere for the clues and as ron and other experts already mentioned because of the little funding available to m e c f s
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00016	unfortunately most of the studies today only can look at on one or 2 aspects of in all the things among all the things and on a small
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00017	group of patients therefore the findings from each individual studies need to be compared so you can find a rigorous signal
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00018	and data collected from different levels for example measuring genes versus measuring infections need to be integrated
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00019	so we can find something called the a chain of evidence that could potentially lead us to the cause of the disease so we have heard enough of this and because of this
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00021	early on open medicine foundation under leadership of doctor ron davis adopted this policy of open data
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00023	which means that as soon pretty much as soon as a experiment is done we try to put data on the internet
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00024	and share with researchers in the community basically in all over the world
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00025	and who you know whoever registered on this website can see the raw data and the type of findings that have been studied
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00027	by our own team and often they would you know tell us what are the findings that we perhaps are missing or they have different interpretation of the results
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00028	so i think that is very important because of the time i would only be able to give you sort of a couple of glimpse of what is on the website
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00030	so this is the sort of the front end of the website it is end m c m e c f s dot stanford dot e d u at the moment we will have another mirror site on harvard domain soon
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00031	so the as you can see here each study is separated into different levels based on the type of the study either the clinical information of the patient
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00032	or the clinical lab tests of the patients or the different type of molecular measurement genes proteins metabolites microbiome etcetera
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00033	so the data are separated into different levels and then we would compare the patient as a group with the controls and that results are also available on the website for people to study
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00034	and perhaps more interestingly we would like to integrate data from different levels together
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00035	so if you have a gene that appears to be abnormal in one patient you would want to see whether the protein that is code by this gene is also affected
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00036	and whether the function of that protein is indeed impaired in the patient
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00037	so just as example obviously this takes a lot of people is work and and that is a list of
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00038	people that actually contributed to this website so this is just one example oops here you can see
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00040	that particular patient and this is the particular test that one can choose and that is the particular threshold of filtering
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00041	so you can choose what you want to see and this shows the results this happen to be a a cytokine data of one particular patient
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00042	and he or she had 2 abnormal tests in terms of their in in terms of the patients cytokine levels so these are the patient groups these are the control groups
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00043	and this triangle indicates the level of the patient so you can see that this particular patient has much lower
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00044	level of this cytokine which is called brain derived neurotrophic factor which is involved in a number of neurological diseases as a biomarker character for some of those diseases
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00045	so this patient has really low level not only comparing to the controls
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00046	but also comparing to other patients so that is potentially value that we want to gather from this type of platform and similarly the other one which is c d 40 l maurine
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00047	talked about the functions of t cells c d 40 l is one of those cytokines that that would affect
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00048	t cell functions for example and here you see that between patient between patient groups and control group there is actually no difference however the level of this particular patient
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00049	for this particular cytokine it is much lower so i hope that while we grow enough number of these kind of observations people can start to link things together
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00051	and this is just our current attempt of doing so so
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00053	so each role here is is one phenotype for example sleep problems cognitive test problems pain fatigue etcetera obviously will measure a lot of those
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00054	and each role here is is the correlation of one of the analyzed at different levels
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00055	that is see significantly correlated with any of these symptoms of of patients so the reddish color shows positive correlation for cortisol level
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00056	and the bluish color showed negative correlation and as we heard from the clinicians early on since there is you know a a a rather large heterogeneity among different patients
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00057	this is one of the reasons that we want to do this type of analysis to see what are the indicators that would be most correlated with a particular type of symptom of the patient
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00059	yeah so this is the groups the physical functions cognitive functions and and sleep problems
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00061	so this is our gene results that is ron already mentioned we try to sequence the whole genome of of patients as much as we can
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00062	and one of the benefits of that ron already mentioned one of the findings
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00063	but yeah the the other way of looking at the data would be that we can actually find those rare pathogenic variants in each patient in a realistically for most of us we have you know
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00064	pathogenic variant one or the other the question more is that whether those variants contribute or potentially contribute to the disease so just as example here is
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00066	c f t r which is the oops which is cystic fibrosis
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00068	gene and you can see that there are 2 we call heterozygous variant there because you know obviously this is one of those variants that is common in in in in the caucasian population
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00069	perhaps more importantly we see actually a lot of these variants that are known to be involved in
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00070	potentially neurological diseases so because of time i will just show you a rough comparison so what this is is is to ask the question
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00071	if you look at the pathways of those variants i showed you in the previous slide and ask
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00073	what have been done on this variant in the study of other diseases for example in pain in sleep disturbance in cognitive impairment and to our surprise
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00074	as you can see here more than 50% of the variants that i showed you are actually known to be involved in all those symptoms
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00075	so since we only look at few patients as as as ron mentioned these were severely ill patients in this particular study we thought that we should
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00076	you know test whether there is accidental findings or we used the u k biobank data there they have a somewhere around 23000
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00077	c f s patients and you can see that yeah if we take their data
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00079	we would get a weaker but still significant signal there so this just give you some clue of what we are trying to do
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00080	and you know trying to see whether we can use this type of information
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00081	to identify the core potential cause of the disease as well as trying to borrow strength
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00082	from studies of other diseases that might be useful for treating m e c f s patients one day now because of the time
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00084	i will probably just stop here
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00002	good morning everyone good morning it is i am going to move away from here it is absolutely lovely to see you all this morning and i thought what i would do is just say a few words of welcome and thank you
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00003	i want to especially start off by thanking scandit who are our drink sponsors last night
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00004	fantastic to see at the end of what was a long and full day of content to see so much networking and friendships going on both in the room outside and elsewhere
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00005	i also want to and importantly say as we enter our 2nd day of this conference thank you again to all our supporters and to our partners and exhibitors
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00006	and especially our platinum ah sponsor ingenica and also to our our noncommercial sponsors as well
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00008	i also at this stage i would also like to thank our friends from
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00010	the a v company quadrant it is fabulous we work with them for 4 or 5 conferences now
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00011	and whatever else is going on whatever panics going on about covid tests and people not coming you can rely entirely on the fact that the video is going to work the graphics of work and the microphones
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00014	i just have to do that i have to do that i am sorry and i know i do it every year but i have to do so thank you i am just going to spend a couple of minutes telling you about what is going to happen today
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00015	and the 1st of which is that i am going to introduce our chair for the day in a few minutes and that is professor sir terence stevenson who is chair of the health research authority
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00016	and he is going to navigate our way through this morning session and that morning this morning session starts as strong as yesterday
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00017	where we have richard murray the chief executive of the king is fund to take us in our helicopter up to 60000 feet keith conradi saying helicopters will not go to 60000 feet they will crash down but he will probably tell me that later
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00018	and then we are delighted to have professor andrew goddard bodd to come and give his view of the front line and
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00020	about the n h s and then finally keith conradi in possibly one of his last public appearances as chief investigating officer of the health care safety investigation branch or hsib
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00021	as it is known maybe he may tell us why it is hsib but not h s i b but who knows
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00023	then we change
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00025	tag ever so slightly because yesterday on this stage was very england focus but as anne said when she welcomed us yesterday one of the things that g s one u k has done over the last 2 or 3 years
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00026	is actually have a focus on the u k bit
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00027	and there are delightfully national programs now in scotland and wales and northern ireland and we are delighted to have colleagues from scotland and wales to join us today and talk through that
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00028	we have steve ah steve bush on stage later to talk about his medical director of operations at leeds and as you know leeds was one of the
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00030	4 forefront and was been at the forefront of the scan for safety program and he is going to talk a little bit about how leeds are moving on from that and what else they are up to then we are going to have a break
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00031	and we come come back and talk about data and one this whole thing about if you are if you scanning things scanning is good but if you get data
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00032	all you are getting is one scan is one beep 1000000s of scans gives you insight and how we are able to use that insight building on some of the some of the sort of conversations we had yesterday
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00033	and then finally on this stage for the morning before lunch our chief exec anne godfrey will come and give a summary of what has happened over the 1st day and a half
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00034	we are then going to make the breakout stages there was such huge content yesterday on the breakout stages so here you hear the big picture and then we go into detail and implementation and process on those stages
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00035	and where we have this afternoon after an early lunch we have on the d h l stage the scan for safety and the future the national scan for safety programs are more detail and more data from wales and scotland
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00037	sustainability on h c s a the h n s talks about sustainability net 02040 or 2050
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00038	and we have got some really interesting presentations on that stage ah led by david lawson who is from guys and tommies
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00039	and one of the things that we have seen most over the last probably 18 months at g s one u k is the move to using g s one standard in a
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00040	very strong way for asset management and that is absolutely been something that is a covid a covid thing so we have got on the on the scandit stage we are going to talk about that
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00042	so last thing for me before terence steps up
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00044	is to remind you of our of our charity to remind you that we will be sending out feedback forms for you to fill in and for each feedback form we receive as i mentioned yesterday
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00045	g s one u k will donate £5 to the d e c for supporting humanitarian relief in ukraine and we have that lovely q r code that you can just snap and make a direct donation too
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00046	so that is it from me enjoy ask questions let us you know have that really interactive participative event that we had yesterday again
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00047	and without further do i would like to invite professor sir terence stevenson to come and chair this morning session terence thanks
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00002	so who here is an addict
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00004	all right i love you already so
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00006	this is a dream i i do not know what else to say this is amazing so my mom started a recovery about 30 years ago she is why i am here so you will hear her bit as as we go through this talk so who is here to relapse prevention
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00008	who thinks that sounds awful i just it is just cold you know and so we we wanted to bring life to recovery like who wants to recover if it is not fun
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00009	you know and so that is what we do we bring this like bright light to recovery and that is really what our goal is so we came up with recovery protection and it is a different approach and i think it gives people the opportunity to enjoy
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00010	preventing a relapse right because if it is not fun are we going to do it why did we do drugs right because they changed the way we thought and we felt
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00011	that is why i did them actually eric clapton was interviewed in 60 minutes and the guy interviewing said so heroin was your 1st drug and he says no it was sugar i was 5 years old
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00012	bread and butter with sugar and wafers and russell brand talks about the chocolate wafers when he was a kid in his book recovery it is this is a drug and we need to treat it like a drug
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00013	so i am going to take you through a stackable 3 tool system and then we are going to do some work together you will find cards stack of cards in the in the middle of your desk
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00014	if you can not find karen she has got her hands up she has got some extras over there and we are going to be doing something together so we are going to do some work
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00015	because i think that is the the work is what what gives us the freedom so the 1st thing we are going to talk about is a trigger free triangle so we came up with this to help people 1st identify the foods that are triggered for them but it actually can go much deeper than that so we are going to talk about debate
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00016	who is ever had who has been on an aisle in a grocery store and never debated
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00018	come on where are the hands there they are all right and the wrong who has been in an aisle in the grocery store
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00019	eyeing your drug food wondering should i or should not i right then we are going to talk about romance that longing that lost rendezvous have you ever eaten food and hidden them in the trash
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00020	or just it is it is like a lustful thing right and the guilt that follows the drug right how long does the pleasure really last
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00021	if you are a late stage addict like me not long and then you right into the guilt so basically
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00023	what we can do is we can use these things to identify the things that are dangerous for us so if should i eat it should i not eat it that deadly question right so i hate to break it to you the answer is no
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00025	you should not eat it right and the romance the planning i i went to nashville like 5 years ago and every single item on my itinerary was about food
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00026	every place i went was about food because i am an addict that is what i do so it becomes as ingrained in how we think and how we live and the guilt
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00027	does it make you feel ashamed does it make you feel worthless or like a failure if it does it is a drug
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00028	so basically debate is playing with matches romance is seeing how close you can get to the flames and guilt is getting burned who has been burned before
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00029	it is always going to burn you folks it is always going to be we forget though we forget and that is why this is so important to go through
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00030	so just here really quick debate asking yourself should i should not i romance the planning in advance the rendezvous
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00032	and guilt that worthless sense of failure after we have done it so that is the 1st tool that is the trigger free triangle okay
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00034	the 3 p is and this is a this goes on to my mom and our now my my grandmother was dying she was on her death bed she was on pallet of care
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00036	and i was in high school and my mom is getting ready to go so we can watch her pass
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00038	and she gets a cooler
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00040	couple ice packs sharks weighing and measuring her vegetables and her meats and like what are you doing
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00042	she says i am protecting my recovery
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00044	wow that is what it takes guys so we need to figure out what is it going to be for you to protect your recovery you do not need to protect my recovery i do you need to protect your recovery so it comes with the planning
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00045	preparing and protecting we are going to walk through these 3 things so you really understand the importance of it okay if you fail to plan you are planning to fail
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00046	if you do not do the steps that you need to do to get to where you want to be you can not get there it is that simple you do not go on a road trip without putting gas in your car do you
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00047	it is the same thing you are going to get an oil change you are going to make sure your wipers are clear right you are going to get ready for your trip and you are going to prepare
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00048	you are going to pack up your car you are going to put in your suitcase you are going to remember your toiletry you are going to do all these things and that is going to protect your experience on your trip it is going to make sure that when you get there you have what you need to do what you want to do
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00049	which is hopefully i have a good time so
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00051	so to prepare is to make ready or able to deal with or do something right it is the steps that we need to take to make sure that it becomes possible for us to engage in the activities that will ensure that we protect your recovery
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00053	feel like this one missing here 0 so i missed plan planning is very important you can not prepare without a plan it is like i do not know if you have heard jordan peterson talk about the stupid plan we have been doing a lot of this stuff in in the village that i run right
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00054	a stupid plan is you figure out where you want to go and then you sit for 5 minutes and you figure out what are the steps that you need to do to get there you do not need it to be right
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00055	you just need do what you said you are going to do and then you fail specifically you will succeed specifically you will adjust your plan so the plan is not set in stone it is the best idea that you have right now and then you engage in that plan
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00057	and that goes to the preparation which we just talked about sorry but too excited and then that enables you to protect your recovery all the things that you have been working on building up until now
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00058	that is the point
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00060	okay now so we we know about the triangle we know about the 3 p is the 3 c is are really it is kind of our take on a sort of a c b t based
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00061	model but it is basically what triggers you what you do what happens
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00063	because usually as addicts if you were anything like me while you had a cue and then you wait your drug
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00064	and then you had a result as a result of eating the drug which usually stunk right it was not where you wanted to be so by breaking it down this way we can see that the cue is a stimulus that set off the event
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00065	the custom is what you do when you are triggered right and the consequences as a result of what happens after you have done the behavior or action or the substance
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00066	that is your cue right so a cue could be anything like believe it or not i was trained as an artist and bread baker not so helpful as an addict but the the point is that my wife was in the kitchen and she was like butter across toast
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00067	and i work right next to kitchen and i am like i am like i am triggered i am like tryna work i am like helping addicts and like here
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00068	right so it could be a sound it could be a smell it could be a time or day it could be a place it could be a person it could be anything so we really need to be on guard for this stuff and really take an inventory
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00069	what are our cues cause they have to be personal to us
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00071	and so we have to be grateful for our triggers
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00073	bottom line they give us information talked about that what does a relapse give you it gives you information then you can become responsible to do something based on the information that you have
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00074	right that is empowering that is recovery
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00076	a custom that is the repeated thing that you have done right doing the same thing you have always done and then you end up with a this then you end up with the same results
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00078	that is my alarm to wake my kids up okay
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00080	believe it or not there is another one in 15 minutes we will get there in 2nd so basically look at this time of day right lots of people get tired around 3 p m
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00081	cheap as that is right about now is not it so what do we do well some of you probably got some coffee or some tea right we get a fix because something that is going to change the way we think or feel right and then what is the consequence maybe we feel ashamed
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00083	maybe you are saying to yourself god why do i do that again i knew what is going to happen i did it anyway
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00084	so right we can change the custom and then we can change the consequence
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00085	so instead of grabbing a fix why do not you take a walk outside why do not you get yourself in nature do something different and you will get something different okay
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00087	because when you change your custom you change your consequence and we have changed your consequences you change your life and that is what we want to do right you can not live the way you live before it is not going to work you need to do something different
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00089	all right so now we are going to play right so we do a lot of this in circle it is called working alone together so i want you to go ahead and grab your cards
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00090	okay you need to make sure that actually before you do that just grab a blank piece of paper
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00092	all right believe it or not as soon as i hit this arrow at time we are just going to start you are only going to have 60 seconds to do this
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00094	so this is the prompt that you are going to have for the time you have you are going to say to yourself i know my recovery is in trouble when i dot dot dot
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00095	you are just going to blast off answers as fast as you possibly can on the blank paper yes nothing is right nothing is wrong
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00096	it is just your recovery and when you know it is in trouble so i am going to wait for this folks to sit down in case they did not have it
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00097	then ready 54321 all right you got a minute i am going to shut up
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00099	it is not playing
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00101	it is a p d f i will just use my timer
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00103	it is sorry it is a p d f so i forgot so
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00105	just keep going do not stop and look at the time
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00107	we will give you 20 more seconds just keep writing till you till you can not write anymore
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00109	all right as my client and with as my co worker and i would say this is good enough for all right so you are going to pull out your cards
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00111	going to make sure that you see in front of you the top card here not the bottom so there there is 2 sides right should be a one in the bottom right corner of your card
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00113	okay now what we are going to do is we are going to give you 30 seconds you are just going to pick a cue from your list one that you feel you could do something about would be ideal
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00114	and then you are going to write it in the cue line on the 1st side and on the back side of the card so all you have to do is pick a cue write it down on the cue line on both sides of the card
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00116	give you 30 seconds to do that
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00118	if you are done show me your pen
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00120	all right about half there
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00122	does not have to be pretty that is the good thing okay now think about your cue
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00124	is it debate
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00126	is it guilt or is it romance maybe it is all 3 that is okay just circle the ones that apply
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00128	if you are not sure circle debate
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00130	trust you got 2
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00132	sometimes we overthink things let me rephrase as addicts we always overthink things
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00134	so it is the interesting thing about addiction right it it is really pirating our mind from an instinctive part of our brain
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00135	so we really have to trust our knowing to kinda get past that and start to build this the blue dog where was talking about that is the prefrontal cortex that is the human brain it is a very
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00136	it is a very capable part of our brain but you can not reach it it is useless to you that is why you can not think your way out of addiction you have to work your way out of addiction you have to do stuff
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00137	okay
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00139	now the custom so when you are in your cue
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00141	what do you normally do
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00143	what happens what is your behavior
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00145	not what the result is but what is the thing you do following your cue just write it down
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00147	no wrong answers
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00149	and now
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00151	what is the result of the behavior that you have done that you have written on your card where does that take you what is the consequence
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00153	kinda dig deep here it is not just that you drug or you
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00155	where does that take you what kind of state are you in what is your thinking like what are your feelings like
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00156	get like visceral gutsy cause we do not want to go here right we do not want to go back there
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00158	pain is the thing that motivates us as addict sometimes get into that it will teach you something
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00160	all alright now you are going to flip your card over all right now we are going to play with the 3 p is a little bit right so basically what we are going to have you do is how will you plan how will you prepare and how will you protect
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00161	when you get this trigger or cue
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00163	basically what you are going to do about it
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00165	you can always elaborate on your plan too but the point is that if you have a numbered system that you would implement you would just do those things in order
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00166	and that is going to take you further away from your trigger closer to your recovery right relapse and recovery happen on ah on a paradigm right you have recovery over here and relapse over here
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00167	and you have to work your way away from recovery in order to work your way towards relapse so by doing these actions you are working your way from relapse back towards recovery back to where you want to go
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00169	it is possible to someone to be in a relapse for a very long time before they pick up a drug
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00171	happens more often than you think
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00173	that is why we want to work over it backwards
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00175	all right so you did your planning you did your planning preparing you did your protecting
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00177	what is the consequence of those 3 things where does that get you how do you feel which state are you in
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00179	what are the words that you would use to describe what that feels like
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00181	this is the reality folks your recovery has to solve the problem your addiction creates it is that simple
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00182	it has to solve all of the problems that your addiction creates and guess what your red dog will morph
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00183	it will do whatever it has to do to make you miserable not even kill you just make you miserable right so we need to stay on top of this and that is why this is not something you do once
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00184	right i just recently moved i have 2 young kids right i do not have the triggers i used to have i have a 2 year old 3 year old she does not play independently
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00185	like she does not want to it drives me nuts like that is a trigger that was not a trigger when i did not have a 3 year old so it it is something it does not have to be like so close to the drug it just can be anything that you feel a little off about
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00186	and by taking an inventory you really know what your recovery has to be made of because if you miss one of these things it could potentially lead to relapse right
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00187	right because you are not protecting your recovery so it is important to take an inventory so the other thing i wanted to tell you is that we have a free event actually starts on monday i am not even going to be there cause i am going to be in an airplane
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00188	basically it takes you through our system and the final day is pretty much this it is recovery protection 101 we call it staying stopped
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00189	so if you have any questions or you are interested just find me or one of my people at the table over there they can give you some information and i wanted to give some time to answer questions i know there is not a ton of time left but
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00190	so shoot i guess
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00002	thank you so much good afternoon everybody ah so my name in indeed is daniela besana and i anticipated that i am ah part of an international ah microsoft team
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00003	but whose name is a global black belt
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00004	who is focused on helping our customers ah to get to the most out of their ai performance computing
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00005	workloads by running them on microsoft azure cloud
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00006	today i would like to spend the next 10 minutes ah together to bring you through some of examples
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00007	we have about our microsoft azure together with the specific partners can actually boost in silico medicine
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00008	ah 1st of all i would like to start from ah the vision
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00009	but microsoft as about how microsoft can actually help in journeys customer journeys and end users journey related that well and life science
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00010	and the idea is actually to ah let us say move away ah from ah a traditional approach
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00011	ah where ah the passion patient is someone that is brought through ah already well defined the processes
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00012	and idea is to ah move ah to to to embrace ah a vision
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00013	where ah the patient can actually be at the center of ah multiple processes or or multiple approaches
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00014	among them there are for example ah the possibility to develop ah personalize the treatments
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00015	the possibility to ah enable effective clinical trials
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00016	ah with the ah the purpose of ah helping ah to make ah new drugs available
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00017	in shorter timeframes ah reducing cost and unleashing the resources for additional research
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00018	ah and also allow ah what has become over the last years a typical approach to have multiple ah researcher groups ah collaborating across the global
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00019	the idea is actually to help those groups ah to to better work and work more effectively together
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00020	ah so cloud in general may become by definition a new approach in i t infrastructure which may definitely help all these approaches
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00021	and microsoft azure cloud in particular is characterized by multiple features and characteristics and approaches and architectures
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00022	that may ah even provide a more ah in a in a it is a framework
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00024	ah 1st of all i would like also ah to provide you some general example not only from a technological perspective ah but also from a program perspective
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00025	microsoft infecta is ah involved in this part of the so called the covid 19 h p c consortium
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00026	ah which is collecting the measure i t ah providers to make computational resources available
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00027	ah for a simulations and any finger which may be required to speed up research related to covid 19
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00028	ah on the other hand microsoft has also launched a 5 years program which is ah a $60000000 ah program
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00029	and it is a philanthropic program which is basically the purpose to provide the computational sources consultancy in order to empower
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00030	ah researchers and organizations ah to exploit and develop ah artificial intelligence solutions in the healthcare
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00032	ah in particular an approach of that microsoft is is keen to pursue is to establish ah significant partnerships
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00033	microsoft is a is a is a greater ah technological and solution provider
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00034	but it is also very keen to let us say ah get to the most out of what is available from the market to to provide the best solutions stuff
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00035	to enable our partners in order to provide ah the best solutions so to our joint end users
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00036	and for sure ah one of the most significant partners we have ah in ah in this framework
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00037	and that is definitely ousting us ah for for this ah speech and for this conference is actually cadfem medical
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00038	as you know ah cadfem medical has developed a platform ah called ah docq
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00039	that as basically the purpose ah to allow ah simulations and ansys simulations
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00040	particular to make them available to be used ah by doctors and medical staff
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00041	ah to resolve multiple possible issues in ah ah in ah in the so called in silico med medicine
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00042	docq is a scalable and flexible software platform and that that is why it is working very well with the microsoft azure
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00043	because of its ah scalable and flexible infrastructure and solution that microsoft azure can actually provide
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00044	ah docq ah core is the platform and over there ah there are multiple modules which may respond to multiple solutions
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00045	ah in we have chosen to consider a few examples out of the multiple ones that the cadfem medical may provide
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00047	ah one is a docq r p e ah which has been designed ah for ah surgical planning of forced the maxillary expansions for example
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00048	era the platform docq platform together with microsoft has allowed to develop ah or to run ah up to 100 biomechanical simulations in just 15 minutes
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00049	another platform ah is ah docq 0 s a ah data supports ah the diagnosis ah and therapy of obstructive ah sleep ah apnea
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00050	also in this case ah typical i performance computing ah fluid dynamics and emphasized simulations are ah used and exploited
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00051	but this time not with the typical idea of develop of using them in typical manufacturing environment so but to to leverage them for insilico medicine
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00052	and ah ah docq v i t it is used for a virtual implant testing ah in this case ah scalability ah is really ah plus
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00053	and microsoft azure ah because of its ah infrastructure is able to support this ah horizontal scalability allowing a massive reduction of simulation times
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00054	and under example ah which is really interesting to me ah is related ah to simulations related ah to artery drug delivery
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00055	as you can also see here ah the idea is actually to better understand drug are distributed ah inside our body based on multiple variable
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00056	in order to be able to minimize drug concentration in ethnic tissues and maximize drug concentration in damage issues
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00057	so our microsoft cloud can actually help in we have seen it with cadfem medical some great examples
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00058	but we could bring multiple examples so again with cadfem medical additional ones and with the ah other partners
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00059	actually the the microsoft cloud has decided to make a significant investment for ai performance computing specific architecture
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00060	so it is not ah actually it is not ah ah general purpose cloud that may use to do performance as computing
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00061	but inside microsoft azure cloud there are some specific architectures and computational resources that have been designed on purpose
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00062	ah to ah provide the best environment for our ai performance computing workloads ah here on on the right ah you you can actually see them
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00063	ah because ai performance computing workloads may have ah different ah may have many characteristic in terms of architecture in common
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00064	but may be very different one from from the other in terms of the computational resources which may be required
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00065	for ex for example as you know very well in some cases workloads are very c p u intensive in other cases there are more g p u intensive and there are multiple other characteristics
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00066	so the idea is really ah through microsoft azure cloud ah to provide ah ah ah a very big range of available architecture and computational resources
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00067	so that each workload each h p c workload may actually find ah the right design the right architecture
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00068	and with a greater flexibility as you can see here and in order to ensure ah that ah the resources that are needed may be available exactly when they needed
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00069	but only if it needed so ah with no ah the ideas really to pay for what is used and to every source is available as soon as possible
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00070	ah but basically not to design and pay for infrastructures design the for pix but but may be available to accommodate the pix
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00071	also leveraging azure cloud ah allows also 1st of all to scale as needed
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00072	so as we were saying ah docq is a kind of workload that is actually requiring the capability to scale ah but also the possibility to leverage the latest technology
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00073	ah so every 6 months every one year every 3 months some computational resources are subjected to technological refresh
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00074	and this is something that in the cloud is made immediately available while on the contrary on premises resources may are normally refreshed in a 3 years of 5 years a timeframe
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00075	that said we are at the end of a our 10 minutes ah another key piece of information i wanted to share with you
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00076	ah is that microsoft azure has been also designed and is constantly maintained ah to allow the largest possible ah regulatory compliance
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00077	as far as public health and social services and life science and forma safety because are concerned ah so with that i definitely want to thank you so much for your time
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00078	remind you that in this 10 minutes we have just provided some great examples of collaborations with cadfem medical
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00079	but we know that ah the range of solutions which may be needed ah for insilico medicine is huge
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00080	and i i would be very happy ah to to have opportunities to discuss them and understand how we can support you in for for other solutions and needed you may you may have
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00081	with the with that if there is any question and if we have still some time available i would be very happy to respond if not really thank you
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00083	thank you very much daniela besana
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00002	i hope that we have conveyed the fact that there is quite ah quite a few activities
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00003	that are ongoing and are being initiated both in collaboration with the stanford center
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00004	and as well as actively pursued within our harvard affiliated hospitals and close collaborators in the organization
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00005	we would hope to use this experience and to expand upon it to create a a very special opportunity in the field of m e c f s
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00006	but in order to do that we do need support from the community we need participation in our in our studies
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00007	and i would hope that we would have an opportunity to to find individuals who would contribute
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00008	to our support and even expansion of these activities over the upcoming months and years
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00009	that is a little bit of a shameless plea for finances and i think linda has a couple of slides here that she wanted to go over
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00010	but we would look forward to having public events going forward in which we can share with the community and professionals in the northeast area our progress
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00011	with respect to the development of the center and all of its collaborations i it is there is very strong intent and interest among the harvard affiliated hospitals
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00012	as well as our colleagues here in boston you know we are we are
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00014	really
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00016	blessed to have many medical and other academic institutions who have very special facilities
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00017	and i just want to share with you that there is a tremendous opportunity for us to make a massive impact
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00018	on a better understanding the the possibility of biomarkers and the possibilities of identifying new treatments in the field of m e c f s
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00019	and so i hope that as you go away and go home today that you have some comfort that there is a very strong commitment
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00020	and interest we could easily double the number of scientists and and clinicians within the harvard affiliate hospitals but all of this does take money
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00021	and we would appreciate if as you go away to think about how you might be able to help in this endeavor we are fully committed
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00022	and we hope that you gain some confidence and some comfort in the fact that
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00024	that there is a commitment within the organizations and the institutions
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00026	thank you
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00028	really overwhelmed when i think about the fact that
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00029	we are able to have researchers getting together at stanford and at harvard and it up and really at other places around the world that we are collaborating with when it is australia and with canada with u k and
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00030	and a lot of other researchers that are not here today but that are behind the scenes working on m e c f s with us and with other people
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00031	and we try to bring them all together to talk to each other and we try to fund and only fund open collaborative research
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00032	and it is really overwhelming ah to think that this is finally happened it is a dream come true to get all these brilliant people together
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00033	and what we really want you to take home today is the hope that is out there and the hope that we all share that research is really happening in a big way
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00034	and we just need to help scale it up because until n i h kicks in more money to be able to help us do this we need to do this in a in a with private funding
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00035	so let me just 1st start by thanking the speakers who spoke today which is wonderful for everything that they are doing and the speakers that came yesterday and the researchers and clinicians
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00036	that not only came yesterday to bring their expertise at the table but it had been helping us at the stanford collaborative research center and here at this collaborative research center and now upsala
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00037	we have way over 80 to 90 different researchers that are really concentrating on this and wanting to make real inroads into what is happening in the body of patients
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00038	so we can treat and we can cure this illness and really find out what is happening at the molecular level and what is happening so we can cause fight find out what the causes in the body so we can treat it and cure this and put this in the past
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00039	there are so many people in the world that are that are suffering and we are really appreciative to the clinicians that are spending their time in treating these patients and we need to have many many many more clinicians
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00040	and we want to be able to fund a center of excellence here at harvard
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00041	and then hopefully at multiple center of excellences is around the world so that patients can actually see patients ah patients can actually see clinicians that can actually treat and help and support their illness as they are getting through this
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00042	i want to thank the organizers of of today and yesterday ah ron tompkins and and wenzhong xiao and ah andrew alexander and marilyn simon gersuk and deie hush did a fabulous job
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00043	and i want to thank the volunteers who helped today from mass and m e c f s f m ah organization that helped us with registration and all we can not do these type of activities without all of your help
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00044	and i want to thank you for the fabulous job that you had and i want to especially thank the patients are here and and really all over the world that are really sacrificing themselves for this research
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00045	because we could not do this research which out without your samples and without you answering surveys and questions and being bothered and having you spend your energy to help us find answers for many many more people that are suffering out there
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00046	and i would also like to specifically thank are the donors some are here today in the audience and they are all over the world who are listening as well we could not do any of this research without you because all of it is privately funded
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00047	so i want to thank you all 1st and i just want to take a moment to do that if you can please share with me
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00049	i have mostly said what is already on the slide but with n i h having 39 a $39000000000 budget we hope someday to be able to have more money for m e c f s funding
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00050	and it may take us getting a biomarker for them to really step up their funding so we have been really trying to find a diagnostic and a biomarker and also also of course to find treatments and to push some pilots going and and some treatments
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00051	and and and and get this going ah from private funding at at this point
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00052	so i mean my goal is to raise $200005000 and really scale up this research we have so many researchers that could spend much more time on this if we had more funding
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00053	so we are asking for philanthropists out there well asking for people who really want to make a difference in medical research and in helping people get their lives back all over the world so i will go anywhere to any time to meet with people who want to know what we are doing and why
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00054	and that so we ask for your help to help us introduce us to those people
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00055	but i want to thank you all for helping us continue this and helping us scale this up over the last few years that we have been doing this we have ah started the foundation in 2012 and we have really started a lot of research in the last few years and
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00056	and it is really on on a real graph going way high quickly so we we need your help to help scale that up what we really need to do is is set up center of excellence here and like i said everywhere
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00057	because if we do not have clinicians seeing patients we do not have research and the patients can not see clinicians they can not be helped
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00058	so one thing we really want to make a real big effort is for medical education and to bring clinicians number one to harvard here at a center of excellence to help
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00059	ah patients be able to have ah not only services but also to have a training ground for other clinicians to be able to train them here and then send them out to help patients everywhere and then to feed all the research that is going to be happening all over the world
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00060	so that is what we call a center of excellence and this is something that i i i hear somebody commented on earlier that they tried to do before we need to do this now
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00061	and as we have here now time time is not our friend and we really need to find answers now but i want you to come go home from here and understand and and believe that people really do care and people are working on this all over the world
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00062	and we are all in this together we all want answers and we all want to help and get patients their lives back so thank you very much for spending the time with us today and thank you very much for your input and your help as patients as donors as supporters
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00063	and we hope to continue what we are doing and really scale it up and thank you all very much
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00065	we have this in your packet ah it is just a postcard of how if you might want to get involved we do want to encourage people just to tell as many people as you can about m e c f s
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00066	we really want to increase their ah awareness and really increase people knowing about it and so ah i will not go over these details but we have this in your packet thank you very much
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00002	all of my research has focused on a cow that has just had a baby so cows have to have a baby once a year in order to make milk
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00004	but when they have the baby there is a lot of different challenges and stressors in their environment that make many of them susceptible to disease
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00005	so my research is really focusing on management practices and the behavior of the cows and how these influence their risk of disease after they have the baby
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00007	i am also very interested in designing pins for cows to have babies and to do that i i let the cows tell me what they want so i give them an environment for instance that has
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00008	one very open area in one very closed area and let them choose which they prefer to cabin the research i am doing at the center involves assessing the emotions of dairy cattle
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00009	this is kind of a recent area of research it involves a cognitive bias task to objectively measure the emotions of the animals
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00010	but this type of study has never been done in cattle before so i am very excited about it it is kind of a complicated experiment but it basically involves training animals in a task
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00011	and how they interpret ah different colored screens enables me to assess their pessimistic or optimistic outlook on life
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00012	so the experiment i just finished right now was a dehorning trial so i looked at their baseline emotions before dehorning and after dehorning i found that during the pain phase they exhibited more pessimistic
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00013	interpretations of these screens so my next plan is to use the same trial to look at the emotions of animals housed socially and housed isolated
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00002	okay good afternoon we are so excited to be standing here in front of you all today and have the opportunity to speak on a topic that we are all very passionate about today is presentation will be focusing on all things marketing branding and social media
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00003	throughout this presentation we encourage you to think about the strength and all of our social media platforms and how it all starts with one purpose and one message one that we all share to start off we just wanted to introduce ourselves
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00004	so i will go 1st my name is isabella voigt and i am the new marketing manager this year
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00006	i am oriana mendez and i am the membership manager
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00008	and i am zach zelenak i am the operations manager
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00010	so i guess we will get right into it so today we will be going over a few different areas that have created strong impacts for our organization and that can be implemented within programs of any size
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00011	today is content includes how we operate some branding guidelines social media requests calendars engagement campaigns member presence photostyle and resources
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00012	all followed by some key takeaways to better your programs marketing branding and social media
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00014	so as a large program we have a marketing team of approximately 70 people with that in mind much of what we do can be scaled down for programs with as little as one person managing marketing
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00015	for organizations specifically marketing is broken down under our marketing manager into 3 teams public relations multimedia and design and technology each team has specific responsibilities throughout the year that helps support our marketing goals
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00017	every year our marketing team directors create new branding guidelines that will be used for the rest of the year branding guidelines serve as the official place for our members to reference when they need clarification on anything specific that encompasses our brand
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00018	and allows anyone who looks at our brand to recognize that it is dance marathon at the university of florida in order to provide one cohesive message to our community we include a vision statement a mission statement and an about us section for all of our directors and our organization to use
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00019	we also include color palettes for our campaign feed as well as our year long colors we decide on the different kinds of fonts that we will use on all our graphics and we include all of our logos that we will use and any supplemental materials as well as on our graphics on social media
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00020	we also include terminology statements so that all of our terms say consistent and capitalized when necessary
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00021	we would definitely recommend creating a branding guideline of your own amongst your marketing team in order to get everyone on the same page and give other members within the within your organization something to refer back to when they are creating content
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00022	if you would like for us to send you our branding guideline we are more than happy to share ours with you so that you have it as a reference
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00024	so here you can see an example of what some of our branding elements look like in action for our current summer campaign feed you will see that the graphics include all the colors on the color palette
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00026	and all and and all the fonts are the same you will also notice that our highlight covers match we always change the colors of these for each campaign to make sure it stands out even more
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00027	even though these details may seem small they make all the difference and allow our feed to represent a very cohesive message
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00029	throughout the year there are endless amounts of events and information that we would like to share on our social media platforms in order to keep this organized and make sure that we are including everything that we can
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00030	we developed a social media request form where members can fill out a google form and tell us what they would like to be posted once they fill it out the marketing teams take all of the information that they give us and decide what our next steps will be moving forward
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00031	all the responses from this form are directly linked to a google sheet where designers will then go in and claim which ones they want to do and then from there we will make sure that they are all added to our social media calendar so we can post it on time
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00033	so to explain this process a little bit further we wanted to give you a scenario that will allow you to better understand how to approach what you were posting and the thought process behind that decision
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00034	an example of a request would be that captain applications are opening on august 30th every time we get a request these are just some of the questions that we are asking ourselves in order to come up the best game plan on how to promote this
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00035	so what platforms should you be using how early do you need to post you need to post reminders should this be a graphic or a photo so i really encourage you to start thinking about all of your post with these same questions in mind
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00036	regardless if it is a large request or a small request it is still very valuable to get creative and trying to think about really the best solution and debating what is best to important what is best and most important to share on that specific platform
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00038	as isabella explained members are able to submit requests for different marketing needs throughout the year
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00040	these are populated into our social media calendar and used to keep track of what needs to be completed and this calendar is key to having an organized cohesive marketing plan throughout the year on our calendar in particular we separate each tab by month and color coordinate by different type of post
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00041	we have also found separating large events and campaigns for their own calendars to be extremely effective
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00043	here is an example of what this exactly looks like on the screen you will see our social media calendar for transform today our largest fundraising push of the fall as you can see we break down larger campaigns hour by hour to ensure that we are staying on track with what needs to be posted
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00044	this calendar is a collaborative effort between the marketing request form and the marketing teams that we were described earlier even if your program does not have the capacity for different teams we highly recommend utilizing this proactive calendar structure to alleviate the stress of constantly coming up with content as it is needed
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00046	i am sure everyone in this room can relate to how art is to increase social media engagement it is something that we are still working on ourselves
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00047	however we would still like to share some of our best practices for each platform and break down what we think is valuable to post and what is not
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00048	so starting with instagram posts we have found that we always get the most likes and comments when we post something that includes photos of people
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00049	as far as instagram stories we really only share updates reminders upcoming events and any extra information that comes up to keep it organized on of all of our highlights
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00050	reply posts are usually successful and we will repost some of the responses to make members feel recognized
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00051	facebook is definitely not widely as widely used as often for users in our generation however we still use facebook albums as a place to share all of our photos as well as facebook events to promote upcoming events that members can share to their timeline
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00053	for more fun presence we use tiktok to showcase the personalities of our members and the fun that they are having our events we always try to share these as reels on instagram even though we do not always share them directly to our feed
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00054	blogs are not something that every program may want to do
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00055	however we have a lot of passionate writers on our team that they enjoy writing these we really only share these on our website and instagram stories for parents and new members that might want to read them
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00056	lastly we are fairly new to twitter but we have found that a lot of sponsors and local businesses in our area interact with us still on there so we always try to update it when we can
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00058	so we execute several campaigns throughout the year as well as our year long campaign that most of our messaging for the year will revolve around while these are implemented to strategically help with fundraising the anticipation and excitement that comes with the announcement of each campaign
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00059	and hashtag that we release with the video also inspires our members and gets them looking forward to what is to come
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00060	last year ours was choose change with the idea that we were willing to adapt to change after the previous 2 years of covid and a complete shift in the way we ran our events
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00061	this was very powerful and every year we try to come up with a relevant message that people will relate and connect with
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00063	in order to make these stand out on social media we try to utilize connective feed as well as the new pinned post feature
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00065	so here are 2 examples of campaign facebook banners we update our facebook cover photos for each campaign and encourage all of our members to update their own personal ones as well with the same one we create
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00066	one simple cover photo change leads to more profile clicks and more questions asked about what we do because cover photos always show up on our timeline and feed we always use hashtags for ours just because it adds that extra push of engagement
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00067	and makes it feel more official again these all match the color palette for that time and update often
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00069	connected feed is a really awesome design tactic that we strive to implement for different campaigns this makes it easy to look at the feed and know immediately where the where the certain campaign starts and ends
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00070	making the feed connect is not too challenging as long as you plan it out in advance what and know what your next 12 post will be so that you can design accordingly to make it work the hardest part is coming up with the design itself and making sure that you are posting in the right order
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00071	here you can see our connected feed throughout our season of miracles campaign you do not have to do this for every campaign but definitely something worth trying when you can
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00073	member presence is a large part of what makes marketing impactable our members help support our cause by connecting on our various by commenting on our various posts and sharing them throughout the year to stimulate this interaction we develop captions and encourage members to engage and tag their friends
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00074	and we facilitate professional headshots to give our members another element of community and organization present year long during certain campaigns we also developed facebook banners as an easy way to boost awareness
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00075	if your organization has teams we also find that team instagram support recruitment efforts and increase a sense of community although they are not officially affiliated with our marketing they are a fun addition that leadership that other leadership can facilitate
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00076	for example our sponsorships team runs sponsorships instagram
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00078	here you can see an example of the professional headshots i mentioned earlier colored polos signify your team affiliation for example our leadership team posts a white polo each year shown on the left whilst our functional teams get a new color each year
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00079	i was on merchandise last year and we had lime green polos isabella was on public relations last year and they had light pink polos the combination of professional headshots and polos elevates our marketing presence year long
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00081	here again you can see isabella is headshot the profile banners you know isabella is headshot is used for cause connected campaigns or specific pushes as orian mentioned our yearlong campaign last year was choose change
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00082	as an element of this our marketing team develops team specific banners that gave members the opportunity to share their their paired miracle child story on social media
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00083	this is a great opportunity to continue to use marketing to boost awareness for our cause in a new way
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00085	our greatest advice when it comes to photos is to capture moments our goal has always been to post photos that strike a memory or allow you to envision the emotions that are occurring within it
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00086	candid photos are always best when trying to capture those moments and emotions rather than just post photos you never know what kind of photo you might need so we always encourage our photographers to take photos of anyone and everyone
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00087	again for branding purposes we put the same preset and logo on our photos every single time so that when we share them people will know immediately that it is d m at u f
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00089	regardless of how large your program is and the amount of requests you get throughout the year being organized is an absolute must
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00090	i highly recommend using a platform that is free such as google drive for all of your calendars assignments forms photos graphics really anything that you can think of to keep it all in one place
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00091	we personally use adobe suite for all of our designs however you can use a free platform like canva that will still allow you to create color palettes logos fonts really all the same things that we do in adobe
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00092	any apps that you want to use to plan out your feed ahead of time i would recommend using preview unfold or tezza
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00094	while we have given you a lot of information today i just want you to remember that we all share the same cause and that there is beauty in the power that we have to share our passion with others
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00095	my greatest recommendation for you all is to make sure that your messaging is always consistent use your social media to get your members feeling valued and recognized
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00096	get creative to make people want to engage with you and continue to look for ways to grow on each of your active platforms
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00098	thank you so much for your time today we really love getting to speak to you all please feel free to contact us with the e mails listed below if you would like to see any more of our marketing materials and at this time we would like to open it up for questions
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00001	so the so next i will introduce the next speaker and down the hay so and
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00003	is your
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00004	up
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00005	for you
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00006	yeah good morning good very good afternoon everybody i am happy to see you all
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00008	okay ah special thanks for ibu safrina saparina yeah for giving me opportunity to share our research activity
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00009	topic given to me is a preliminary research on indonesian gut microbiota related with the
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00011	mal nutrition and metabolic disorder
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00013	content of my presentation related with a that microbiota of indonesian population from infant to elderly based on our group study
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00014	and and some result on a gut microbiota of ah metabolic disorder respondents particularly for obesity and ah type 2 diabetes ah subjects
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00015	and also i will also focused on a gut microbiota of a mal nutrition children however our sample it is very limited
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00016	because ah we conduct research with a sample from yogyakarta and ah bali and also lombok it is very limited compared to indonesia very very huge
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00018	before i start ah to the topic i would like
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00020	to give some introduction about ah our research group at universitas gadjah mada
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00022	we started research on ah isolation of electric acid bacteria from traditional fermented food and other sources since ah 1991 up to now
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00023	and we got 100s of isolates which were then start an umpule at the food and nutrition culture collection
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00025	in early
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00027	year of ah 2000
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00029	we started screening our isolates which potential as a probiotic candidates currently we have a several screening probiotic
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00030	we have also conducted human clinical trial on the health benefit of our indigenous probiotic which involved gut microbiota analysis
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00031	so that is why our gut microbiota study actually start from the clinical trials of a probiotic
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00033	so we are also involved in asian microbiome project lead by professor yuan kun li since 2008 up to now after 2 years
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00034	now our ah university state as a university center for excellency for probiotic studies
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00035	yeah because ah our consistent research related to probiotic
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00037	so
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00039	this picture mentioning about the
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00041	gut microbiota from infant school age children is ah the result of ah i m p ah one and ah 3 or 4 i did not remember
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00042	and also gut microbiota of ah adult and elderly based on our own study
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00043	we can see here in the picture here
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00044	yeah
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00045	this is the showing the top 30 general of ah microbio
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00047	fickle microbial of baby yeah and we can see here start from one month 3 months 6 months 12 months and more than 12 months
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00049	about ah up to 2 years we can see here dominancy of ah microbiota in the fickle baby are
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00051	bifidobacterium and also bacteroides
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00053	and this is ah very much different if we compare to gut microbiota of the mother
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00054	but after 2 years we can see here the profile of ah microbiota of children resembled to the mother
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00055	so we can see here we can conclude that ah indonesians infant have a
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00056	bacteroides and bifidobacterium enterotype while start from school age and then adult and elderly they have ah prevotella enterotype
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00057	and according to our ah research for elderly who live in yogyakarta and also at the bali they are a bifidobacterium
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00059	then to decrease while the enterobacteriaceae then to increase
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00061	okay
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00063	here is a picture
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00065	when we get a sample from ah elderly at the bali in the year of ah 2016 yeah
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00066	we must the patient interviewing the elderly here asking about the the daily diet and also health condition including the physical activity
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00067	and we also have to be patient to wait ah their feces yeah sometimes start from early in the morning
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00068	and we compiled the feces here and put it in a ah cold ah condition
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00070	and then we put in our luggage in this picture yeah we appreciate to the all researchers who involved who participate in ah collecting fickle samples
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00071	we just like ah tourists with a lot of luggage here yeah we have to bring from ah denpasar to our city yogyakarta yeah lot of luggage
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00072	because ah we bring a cold box yeah ah including fickle materials inside
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00074	so
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00076	this figure show the relations the relationship between gut microbiota and other organ such a brain here
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00077	and also kidney and even lung yeah
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00078	we know where yeah the terms gut microbiota brain axis several important gut microbiota metabolic like here this is shorts in fatty acid
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00079	and peptide yeah bioactive peptide including kaba play role as a neurotransmitter
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00081	gut microbiota also support via immune system which important to support gut health however the balance of gut
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00083	when the balance of gut microbiota is disrupted by several factors such ah antibiotic treatment food borne pathogen
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00084	even covid 19 virus yeah as well as unhealthy life dysbiosis occur
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00086	according to our studies dysbiosis occur in malnutrition or stunting children metabolic disorder person yeah like in obesity and diabetic type 2
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00087	and now we also learned the that dysbiosis enough nafld patient including gastroenteritis eosinophilic yeah
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00088	at the moment we conducted the gut microbiota ah
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00090	from the this 2 patient
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00092	okay
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00094	some of ah our publication it is ah in our website yeah
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00095	ah professor nakayama this morning it also already mentioned about the correlation between ah ah consumption of a
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00096	high carbohydrate here related with the dominancy of ruminococcaceae and also bacteroides in the diabetic type 2 person
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00098	while consumption of fat yeah cause increasing of romboustia related
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00099	also with prevotella yeah this is occurs in the ah obesity person yeah
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00101	this is a a publication related to the i m p project
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00103	so
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00105	we can see here this is a report of government in 2021 in indonesia still facing problem
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00106	on a prevaling ah pre this is a prevalency of a stunting yeah indonesia still facing problem on a this stunting yeah some even the color it is a big black yeah
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00107	and ah in fact
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00108	we select only 2 area
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00110	for study the microbiota of stunting or under nutrition the children at the yogyakarta here yeah at jawa
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00111	and also at lombok lombok it is really red color mean that in this area problems stunting it is more serious yeah compare to other places with yellow or green color
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00113	okay this is study on a gut microbiota of normal and under nutrition
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00115	children with the age at 3 to 5 year the location of the subject it is from yogyakarta
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00116	the number of subjects about 28 the children we conduct this this research during pandemic
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00117	so it is difficult for us to get more subject yeah for this study we can see here about the food consumption
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00118	actually these research conducted in the area with the socio and also in economically similar
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00119	yeah so i mean that the income of the parent are similar is that the different it is the diet for their children
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00120	we can see here yeah under malnutrition under nutrition children consume snack and sweet much yeah much more compared to the normal children yeah
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00121	and here seemed that sweet and snack maybe gave what you call it yeah effect to the regular meals
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00122	so that is why maybe children does not want to eat the regular meal because they prefer snack and sweet and according to our data we can see here
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00124	the differences of this diet yeah give also dysbiosis we can see here the
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00126	proportion firmicutes and compare to proportion of firmicutes and bacteroides increase yeah while proteobacteria higher
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00127	and actinobactria lower
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00129	and this also affect to the short chain fatty acid between these 2 group we can see here the propionic acid and butyric acid it is much lower
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00130	in the malnutrition children yeah while the p h it is higher yeah here the p h it is higher in the malnutrition children we can understand yeah during the dysbiosis yeah
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00131	when the many bacteria changing yeah and here particularly we know that proteobacteria consists of several pathogenic bacteria
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00132	and actinobacteria here it is like bifidobactri the example it is bifidobacterium becoming lower yeah we understand the short chain fatty acid here it is decreasing
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00133	in the malnutrition children there are also over expression yeah genera of methanobrevibacter anaerococcus eubacterium and also succinivibrio succinivibrio we
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00134	we have published already these last 2 years
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00135	and the the next we compile yeah we compile fecal samples from undernutrition with the location at lombok
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00136	with more severe compared to yogyakarta the ages yeah yogyakarta we conduct gut microbiota 3 to 5 year old is in lombok
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00137	we conduct 9 to 11 years old children yeah here is some picture
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00138	when we gave information yeah about some document that must be filled out yeah like
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00140	informed consent dietary pattern they must fill in yeah we help them to fill in the dietary pattern and also the other questionnaire yeah
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00141	and then they gave them the cool box yeah and then the child
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00142	you have one more minute
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00143	yeah the child okay thank you yeah the children will bring it to their home and give this to or us in the morning the following day
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00144	okay the very important yeah this one we can see the dietary intake its really lower for the undernutrition student eh undernutrition children
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00145	and also we can see here some yeah many 5 among 6 yeah phylum
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00146	also different significantly and here you i can see bifidobacterium is very very lower in
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00147	undernutrition children while akkermansia it is higher this is a very interesting
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00148	which we think that akkermansia yeah akkermansia becoming dominant because no nutrition for other microorganism so that
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00149	akkermansia that have akkermansia muciniphila that have mucin degrading enzymes
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00150	they have opportunity to become dominant in this undernutrition group
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00151	okay and since our research is actually related with a probiotic we have several study on intervention of local probiotic
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00152	yeah and also their gut microbiota after intervention on overweight adult and also diabetic woman is including nafld
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00153	and also gastroenteritis patient yeah some we already publish yeah and then some we still conduct this research it is still going on
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00154	okay take home message more fecal samples needed from different tribes and places yeah including health status of indonesia
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00155	for obtaining real picture of indonesian gut microbiota and their correlation with the health condition of course collaboration with all partners is needed yeah
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00156	this is our team and happy to mention about our website here we conduct training course on gut microbiota analysis
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00157	and also analysis of gut microbiota particularly for graduates student and also we conduct clinical trial for industry related to probiotic and gut microbiota
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00158	okay okay thank you thank you very much and now for the very ex
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00160	like to stop okay
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00161	yeah thank you
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00002	hi everyone my name is lindsay wilson and i am the executive director of dance marathon at florida state university
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00003	and i am super excited to be speaking with you today about how you can look at your data to make database decisions during your fundraising pushes
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00005	1st i want to get a quick overview of the topic that we will be discussing today the 1st part of this presentation will outline important data points that you should be looking at during your fundraising pushes
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00007	i will cover the importance of looking at this data critically and exactly what data points that you can analyze additionally i will be talking about our year over year data
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00008	and how you can use this to make database decisions within your program whether it is during your marathon or whether a fundraising push event you will be able to do that
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00009	i will include some examples of looking at this data and how our program at d m at f s u formats are tracking documents to best view this data
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00010	at the end i also have an example tracking document and if needed you can contact me for that as well the 2nd part of this presentation will be about using that data to make decisions during your fundraising pushes
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00011	how to solve the problems that you are seeing or even how to approach the positive data that you are looking at
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00012	during this part of the presentation i will also cover different ways that you can improve or incentivize your fundraising in the moment even if it is right in the middle of your main event
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00014	looking at your data can be extremely beneficial for every program but i also recognize that sometimes it can be extremely overwhelming
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00015	however if you are able to see this data during your fundraising initiatives you are able to pinpoint who is excelling and who is falling behind so that is a huge benefit of looking at your data
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00016	this allows you to be really proactive about solutions and the way that you respond to your data analysis as long as you are able to pull this data beforehand
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00018	if you do have this data accessible before your fundraising pushes and your process is a little bit more automated as i will show you in a little bit
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00019	you may be able to look at your data to make better decisions on how to target specific areas that you may need to improve in for fundraising or even engagement within your organization
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00020	some important data points that we look at specifically artifice you are our active fundraisers that is broken down by position
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00021	positional breakdowns in their income internal teams year over year our external teams year over year and our k through 12 programs year over year data i will go into this a little bit more into detail with some examples on the next slide
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00023	now these screenshots are from our tracking document that we created for a mean effect last year these are just some examples of what our documents look like to analyze our data depending on how we look want to look at it
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00024	as you can see at the top we can input a specific time and our numbers throughout the document will auto adjust to give us an idea of where our numbers were at compared to the last few years
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00026	we are able to quickly see this data and compare it in order to make decisions about areas we may need to target for improvement or areas that we may need to work at and use that to make improvements in other areas
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00027	the 1st screenshot is our year over year active fundraisers as you can see our core team which are coordinators showed an increase in engagement compared to the previous years
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00028	what we are able to do here is take this positive aspect of the data and use it to improve other areas that may not be seeing as much success
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00029	during our main event we went to this core team to see what was working well for them which we were able to apply to a team like our captains as you can see who may have shown a little bit of a decrease in their active fundraisers
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00030	the next screenshot is income percentages that is broken down by position using this document we are able to use similar tactics to see what is working well in order to target different areas of fundraising such as our alumni
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00031	the next screenshot is of our total internal team income and this can be really helpful as we are able to look at those specific times in that overall income broken down by team to see which team may need a little bit more of a boost
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00032	in fundraising or even in an engagement it leads us to looking at how our organization may respond best to implementing new fundraising strategies in the moment
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00034	if your program is able to look at this data in the moment you may be able to make quicker more efficient and successful decisions based on how you believe that your organization respond will respond because every organization responds differently
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00035	this could be things such as a competition based fundraising challenge live updates and transparency with your totals or even saying that it is their your dancer is last chance to reach their goal
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00036	the purpose of looking at this data in detail here though is to not be afraid to make changes while it is happening
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00037	and learning that it is okay to implement a brand new fundraising push in a moment during your marathon which is how we stumbled across some solutions that we have created such as fundraising face up
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00039	now fundraising faceoff began originally as an internal team only tradition
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00040	on push days where all of our internal teams competed in a bracket style competition we really have an overwhelmingly but positive response to this initiative so much that we were able to implement this with our organizational teams as well
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00042	it really helped to promote a friendly competitive atmosphere to encourage that positive fundraising mindset
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00044	the chairs and their delegates within these organizations could also encourage their members to participate incentivizing it in different ways depending on how they believe their organization will respond
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00046	in such as encouraging them to hit their team goal or even reaching an incentive that the chair or delegate was going to get that during our main event we were able to broadcast this image on our screens to show live progress and updates
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00047	the teams are really able to see their progress live on the screens during our event
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00048	and our organizations responded really well to this competition style fundraising push so this is one way we were able to see our data look at it okay maybe we need a little bit more improvement
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00049	in the fundraising areas of our teams so therefore we were able to implement things such as fundraising faceoff
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00051	so power hour is another way that our program at f s u implements to kind of increase fundraising when it is needed after we are looking at that data so during power hour this hour is solely dedicated to fundraising
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00052	however you can set whatever goal you want whatever that looks like for your program or what you think may work best
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00053	for example we use hit your next 00 which could mean going from $562 to $600 during this hour
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00055	another goal for power hour could be to reach their goal for the push or for the marathon or even hitting that personal or team goal that they have set throughout the year
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00057	we are able to display our increasing total live during power hour on the screens they were updated live in event as our m cs hosted the whole hour including team and fundraiser shout outs to those who hit that next 00 milestone
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00058	this document screenshot on the bottom is from a list of names we pulled from a report that indicated if they hit that next 00 if they were announced by the m cs and if they hit it again during that hour
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00059	this live recognition really recognizes them for their hard work and we were also able to continuously integrate our morale team for encouragement and hype to make this hour super exciting and engaging
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00060	so power hour can be one way to kind of increase that engagement as well as fundraising bring back that community aspect to fundraising and foster that positive fundraising mindset as well
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00062	this year we really begin to focus more on venmo integration we really wanted our members to donate directly from venmo to donor through donor drive in order to discourage them from holding those venmo balances in their personal venmo accounts
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00063	we really highlighted at donating directly using this venmo transaction feature in donor drive which really helped us to also see more realistic numbers in our data when we were looking at that data
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00064	if our money is actually getting put into those donor drive accounts and not just sitting in those venmo accounts
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00065	there are many different ways that we are able to promote the use of this though and we are able to create creative based on the areas we needed to see a little bit more increase in
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00066	one way that we did this was by saying that every 10th venmo donation and the next hour would be matched to do this we pulled a report filtered for venmo donations and then went through every 10th one to see which one would be matched
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00067	another way that you may be able to promote the use of this feature is by saying that the team with the most venmo transactions in the next hour wins some incentive that you set from your organization
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00069	again you can do this by pulling report to see those venmo transactions and looking at it that way
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00071	lastly you can really promote the use of venmo integration feature by creating a main page for fees and tickets and promoting donating venmo in that way
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00072	we really targeted this feature when it seems like students maybe holding their venmo balances or other tactics were not showing as much success and it was something different that our participants really had not seen before marathon this year and and ended up seeing a lot of success from it
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00074	next one of my favorite ways to respond to those areas you may need to be proven after looking at your data is by implementing a final fundraising push within your push or even your main event
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00075	so this last year at our marathon our fundraising development team kind of created a theme for fundraising for the for our marathon which was legos
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00077	so we named our final fundraising push building our legacy and really the goal of this push was to hit your overall fundraising goal whether that was a team or personal goal during the very last hour of the event
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00078	this really successfully encourage our dancers to reach their final dollars before the end of their shift and get all of their fundraising in before the year was over
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00080	this graphic that is on the slides was displayed live on our screens as well which showed increasing lego blocks as the last hour unfolded
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00081	fundraising initiatives in these in events such as these final pushes really emphasize how you can truly make decisions in real time by looking at your data
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00082	through all of these initiatives we are able to incorporate both engagement and fundraising strategies to kind of build and foster that positive fundraising mindset that sometimes you see a lacking during those big fundraising pushes or during the marathon event
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00083	so through these things you are not only able to increase fundraising after looking at the data and areas you may need improvement but you are also able to engage your members in a new exciting way
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00084	that kind of build a more positive mindset around the organization and around the fundraising aspect of what they are doing
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00086	being open to adjusting and being creative during your event will really allow you to make the best decisions for your program
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00087	and to target those areas you may need to see more success in or you may want to see more success and with fundraising
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00088	and in the end of the day it is truly all about being ready to make changes being adaptable and really giving your participants opportunity to fundraise creatively and have fun while doing it
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00089	because at the end of the day all we want to do is foster that positive fundraising mindset and draw that cause connection back to the organization and help our participants realize why they are fundraising and why they are doing this at the end of the day
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00091	thank you so much for listening today please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions about looking at your data how to implement these strategies into your program but at the end of the day whatever works best for your program works all programs are different
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00092	but we are really incorporating those engagement strategies and fundraising strategies in order to build that cause connection trust within your organization
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00093	and that positive fundraising mindset is really what will help you best respond to your data in the moment when you need it the most thank you all
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00002	we are here today to talk about wartburg college is registration push day i am alyssa guse i am the campus relations chair
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00004	and i am reagan barrett and i am the hospitality chair
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00006	so a couple things about awards and to the background about wartburg college
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00007	we are in waverly i a a kind of smaller town we have about 1500 students on our campus our organization was established in 22007 to 22007
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00008	ah we have 29 kiddos in our organization so that is just like the different kids that we have with the families and then we our total amount of participants for last year was 374
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00009	i mean we currently have an award for our miracle maker award that means that like we have a we have been in an organization for like between 10 to 14 years and we got that award and we are a number 7 in the nation for the amount we have raised per capita
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00011	so what is registration push day registration push day is a day that we set through at the beginning of the school year it is our 1st event and we tried to get as many participants signed up during that day
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00013	so some strategy strategies that we use is we are sending out emails to lapsed participants at midnight
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00014	so how we do this is we get our lists from last year that were our in dance marathon and we sent it to them and then for our 1st years to get them involved
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00015	as they do an involvement fair during orientation week and if they are interested they come to our booth and sign up an email to send out to them
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00016	we also in our email send out links to them on that too we do a promo code usually it is like $5 off that day
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00017	we also can text to 51555 to register we tried to set goals think of bigger pictures and breakdown strategies we usually do a power hour
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00018	which is usually between 7 to 8 or 8 to 9 and during that hour we tried to get as many participants signed up during that time and our of course our executive team continues to recruit throughout the whole day
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00020	so what is our the key to our successful registration push day it is our morale captains our morale captains are basically the star of the shows they help run everything
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00021	there is usually a competition between our morale captains
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00022	just to see who can get the most amount of participants it is usually last year i think it was a hydro flask and a gift card or like just something like that to like kind of help them not get motivated but like a reward for their hard work
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00023	our morale captains also print out q r codes and also make sure that they sign them up to for their team
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00024	usually that we have like morale captain have like a specific amount of a a goal for how many people they want on each on their team
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00025	and so they do that they have their own individual promo code so it is like another of the $5 off
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00026	and then getting them pumped so getting them excited for it and giving them the resources to succeed if you do not have morale captains our closest probably thing would be like having an exact team
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00027	or anybody that is like really close or really involved within dance marathon it would be another way just to basically just like give a price to whoever recruits the most amount of people or something just to reward them for everything that they have done for the successful day
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00029	so what is the reason to join well there is always so many different reasons to join but some 3 big ones is a social cause cause connection academic or professional resume builder for leadership and experience
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00030	so for me mine was always a cause connection ah in high school we had a student in my grade that had leukemia cancer and we always tried to fundraise
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00031	and i always wanted to continue somehow to fundraise for the university of iowa stead family children is hospital
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00033	does this work it works yes it does so we started this about in the fall of 2020
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00034	that is kind of when we decided hey let us do something different to register and get as many people as we can for more for to join this organization and 0 okay
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00035	so in 202020 and slash 2021 ah we recruited 252 participants and we had 340 overall
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00036	and then in 2021 and 2022 we recruited 300 participants on that day and had only 371 total total
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00037	so our registration push day is our 1st event of the year so basically we are not fundraising at all any money or anything for our donor drives we are just solely trying to figure out a way to get the most people involved
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00038	and with our organization on campus and it is a surprise
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00039	and only the executive team know so it is kind of like a spur of the moment 0 there is this involvement fair we can sign up there or 0 we are just going to have a big party on campus lawn that kind of stuff
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00041	so how does it help my program so our fund raising improved tremendously on children is health day in 2019 we only have fundraised $1700
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00042	and then in children is health day in 202020 we fundraised $6751.29 we were 2nd in iowa for fundraising 22nd in the nation for fundraising and 2nd in our tier
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00043	and then on children is health day in 2021 we fundraised $8500 and then for the week we did fundraise 1500
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00045	so some other things that we also use are these graphics so on the left we have a q r code we have this posted on our social media a lot
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00046	and also we print them out and have it posted throughout our campus so it is easier for people to scan it on their phone instead of checking their emails a lot and then we also do on the right throughout the day we just want to thank our
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00048	participants that have signed up so far and usually send them out an email thank you ing them and we also send it out on our social media and post it there
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00050	any other things that we usually do to implement on registration push day
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00051	is we usually have like on campus lawn there is a whole there is games up get played just a very interactive space for people on campus just to come and see what is going on
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00052	we usually have like music being played so it is kind of loud at campus trying to draw attention to people that type of stuff
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00002	hello hi everyone hi and thank you very much for joining this workshop and for organizing this event it is really exciting to have all of you here
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00003	and so i just wanted to briefly introduce myself
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00004	ah i am lauren and as as martin said i am the c e 0 and co founder of animal advocacy careers and my background is in client consultancy so i used to work it for a global market research company and i am now in the nonprofit world
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00005	and so hopefully i can give give you all some guidance on how to navigate that situation and so can everyone see my screen and can i just get like a bums off if we can see the screen
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00006	wonderful thank you going well so far usually quite out with this technical stuff ok so the go ah at this workshop
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00007	is that we will all leave the workshop with at least one new resource connection idea or action that we can take away to help you progress your career
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00009	and so the idea of the workshop itself is to discuss how to use your career more effectively and to essentially help more animals through our career
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00010	but in order that we do this it is actually vital to spend some time actually planning this and there is 2 reasons for this the 1st one is because not all altruistic an actions are equal
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00011	and the secondly is that sometime thinking or planning could actually multiply the impact you have by up to 10 to a 100 times which is quite a lot
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00012	and save okay here is a summary of what the session will entail
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00013	ah i will be doing a 20 minute presentation going through your different steps of the career decision making process and outlining available resources which you can look into in more detail after the presentation
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00014	and then we will do 5 to 10 minutes of introspection so i want you all to sit there and and kind of like just drop down some of your key uncertainties or specific areas that you want to think about
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00015	and then i am going to give you some final resources and that you can again take away and do some more like planning and then you are going to join a group
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00016	where we are going to all just kind of like discuss and and martin is going to very kindly assign you all to different groups different instructions and then we are going to finish with a q and a session
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00018	okay and so a little bit more about animal advocacy careers and as as we said it was created to help ah individuals maximize that potential and that positive impact for animals
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00019	and i guess there are many ways that we can think about how an individual might contribute to helping animals ah one might be that an individual might make a dietary change like be vegan or vegetarian
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00020	and but one of the ways that we are most excited animal advocacy careers that individuals can make a significant impact for animals is through utilizing our career
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00021	it has been estimated through research that most individuals spend approximately 80000 hours of their time
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00022	and their lives in a career so it kind of makes sense and a key factor where individuals can make a significant difference to animals would be to utilize their career to help as many animals as possible
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00023	and and with such a big opportunity at stake it is arguably our duty to spend some real time thinking through opportunities and thinking through a concrete strategy of how we can help individual how we can help actual individual animals
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00024	and through our careers it might seem a little boring some people might think it is overwhelming and slightly melodramatic but if we actually take through a scenario where we maybe would have 2 job opportunities i think we can maybe
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00025	talk through this a little bit more so for example you might have a job opportunity where it is the 1st one that comes to you and it would enable you to help 100 animals over the over the course of 5 years of your career
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00026	but had you waited for 2 weeks longer then you would actually have the chance to help 10 times that amount of animals in the same amount of time
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00027	so as you can see there can be very significant differences to you being able to make an impact just through a small choice that you would actually make
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00028	and so one of the the the problem is is that there is disparity between opportunities for individual impact and we also have a limited amount of time
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00029	so it makes sense that we try and think through options and prioritize them all accordingly so that we can assess opportunities when they arrive
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00031	so where do we begin with this and most of this is lifted from an excellent article and each 12 hours at website which i would all i would recommend everybody
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00032	which is called how to make ah tough career options and so sorry how to make tough career decisions and so this will help us to build a really strong framework for prioritization
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00033	and for future opportunities and also plan out our strategy to maximize our impact so step one is to clarify the decision that we are actually trying to to
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00034	make and so we want to have a clear idea of exactly what it is that we want to achieve through our career and strategic planning
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00035	and so for it might be for an individual that you might be choosing between 2 concrete job opportunities
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00036	and some people might be wanting to do long term career and strategy
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00037	but for the sake of this workshop and the widest applicability we are going to ah consider coming up with more of our like medium term options
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00039	and so for if we are taking medium turn then we start to think about what are our most important priorities for this
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00040	and so this will obviously be quite individual and it will be very unique to specific individuals on their priorities
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00041	but and some of the some of the things that we have written down here would help an individual to really try and maximize and their their potential through their career
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00042	so the 1st is impact potential then we have personal fits and career capital option value value of information
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00043	and i am going to go through each of these in slightly more detail to try and remove the jargon and also to give you all some resources so that you can look them up individually afterwards
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00045	so the best and i believe the most important is actually impacts potential so how much impact potential do you have with each of the job opportunities that you are considering
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00047	this is perhaps one of the most important parts of it and an excellent guide for this is the center for effective altruism is resources page which goes through this in a lot more yeah in a lot more detail
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00048	and because a lot of it comes down to cause prioritization i am assuming that most of us here are thinking about
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00049	trying to help animals and but then from that you are also restricted by by the specific cause that you are that you are focused on so it could be that you
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00050	the the next particular thing would be that you have to decide between either focusing on companion animals or farmed animals and an excellent resource for that is animal charity evaluators why farmed animals
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00051	they also have charity reviews and intervention reviews as well because again it is not just the fact that you be considering cause prioritization
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00052	but you also have to think about specifically and what kind of role that you might actually be thinking about or considering and how much impact potential that role has as well
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00054	so the next terms that we are going to look at our personal fit personal satisfaction career capital option value and value of information
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00055	so i i booked a lot into this one section but the reason is because a lot of the resources that are available on this are very similar
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00056	so we have got and 80000 hours career views which goes through this in a lot more detail some of the resources that we have at a c like the skills profiles
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00057	we will go through and and it includes some tips to things like personal fit and and we also have a a glossary terms to go through these in in more detail
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00058	but essentially we just need to think about each one of these factors and how important actually is and but to remember them all when we are considering career opportunities so that we are able to adequately prioritize between opportunities
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00060	so there is there is some individual research you can do as well which is mostly just googling looking through resources but another really ah good way to actually find out some more information is to ask individuals that you might know already
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00061	so when you have to some job opportunities that you might be thinking about to go through these different metrics and ask individuals
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00062	what they think and the career the career capital opportunities are the option value or the value of information
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00064	and so we have we talk us a little bit about like individual potential so that is like the individual metrics and how each opportunity might help you as an individual to progress your career of animals
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00065	and the next thing that we want to think about is community so we want to also consider the fact that each one of these job opportunities has significant has the potential to significantly help the community and in 2 ways
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00066	one is to consider our relative fit or comparative advantage so how we would compare to somebody else who would also be taking that opportunity
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00067	and the 2nd is community capital so how do we as an individual contribute to the wider community by the role that we are actually taking
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00068	and and these are quite important ah aspects and can really shift and how much impact one could have from 2 opportunities that you might be considering
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00069	but it is quite difficult for an individual to actually assess this by themselves so we at a c have have spent a little bit of time this year trying to help individuals really understand that
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00070	and through 2 things that we have done one is the animal advocacy spot check and the 2nd is our talent bottleneck survey
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00071	so both of these were conducted to help individuals and understand a little bit more about this there is some some various limitations to the spot check which my co founder ah jamie conducted
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00072	one that you need to be aware about aware of is that they are just currently filled roles and the ones were currently advertised
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00073	and it is also just a snapshot of a specific period of time and we are hoping that in future we will also be able to retrospectively go back and compare the 2
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00074	and but some notable points which might be worth considering was that both fundraising and operations roles were overrepresented in the advertised job opportunities compared to the current roles
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00075	and this suggests that filling roles is difficult for effective animal advocacy nonprofits
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00076	and and also provides weak evidence that operations expertise is a bottleneck for effective animal advocacy nonprofits
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00077	and the 2nd was that campaign roles and research rules were both slightly underrepresented in job ads
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00078	this matches our impression that these roles are generally popular and oversubscribed and in the job specifications for advertised job roles communication skills in english language were frequently requested as important
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00079	and remote work was common but flexibility by country revenue of of residency was not
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00080	and most jobs required experience and related types of roles so the average role and the average for this was about one.8 years of experience to was required in each one of these job roles
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00082	and so the 2nd thing we did was ah conduct the that this time last year actually and 12 c years and hiring professionals from 9 to 10 at stand out firm charities currently listed on a charity page
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00083	and formally or now and and that was asking the organizations like what bottleneck do you most identify at the organizations
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00084	as you can see overwhelmingly fundraising and unsurprisingly funding was the major ah talent bottleneck which again is sorry the major bottleneck for organizations
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00085	and but interestingly enough 75% of those organizations said they would prioritize hiring fundraisers ah in future rather than just having the donations themselves and that was to enable them to have more of a sustainable cash flow
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00086	and so some of these questions matched up quite well and the the survey that we did versus the spot check
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00087	and and other things were slightly different and so in in this for for example there was quite a lot of ah mention of people struggling to hire senior managers and leaders
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00088	and which interestingly enough was also in the formulas survey that just recently came out and but it was not matched in the spot check so that is either an issue with our spot check or just like a
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00089	some random variance but and the important thing is that we can try and get an understanding of their key bottlenecks so that when individuals have the option where all elses being equal on individual level the 2 options are similar
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00090	that you can have significantly more impact for animals by taking an opportunity where there is a key talent bottleneck in the animal advocacy community
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00091	this is the one that is ah where where your comparative advantage is minimally low
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00093	and again these terms are on our website on our glossary of the terms of that is helpful to people and so you have got those 2 which i have just discussed with you and again i would really encourage people to ask individuals that you might know
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00094	and about what they think their key bottlenecks are or to ask people who are in these roles like if they think that
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00095	that they are particularly overall undersubscribed and but just generally asking more people and encouraging them to give you feedback on on your comparative advantage in comparison to other people
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00096	and is really good and at the end of this year we will also be trying to look into some more research maybe about quality adjusted staff members and how much incremental and
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00097	ah incremental and impact individuals can have but that is not until the end of this year so feel free to to people in time
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00099	okay so i have talked quite a lot now and and now my screen has decided to do that so i am really sorry about that so the next part of the presentation is that we want to generate some more options
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00100	and so the the idea now is that we have gone through step one ah which is to clarify our decision we have gone through step 2 which is to think about our key priorities
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00101	and our 3rd step which is really important is to generate some options and i know people are usually quite reluctant to do this and they will usually come up with one or 2 but i want to try and encourage everybody to think of as many options as they can
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00102	and because it tends to be the situation that we under under
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00103	come up with options rather than overcome up with options and then the the ones that you 1st come up with are never the best one so you need to keep thinking and i am going to put up a few ah options here that people might want to consider
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00104	and so you could work for a nonprofit you could work for animal free from company you could work in a management of leadership
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00105	lobbying start a new charity work in the legal space marketing on communications and all of these ah resources i am putting up here well maybe
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00106	try and help and encourage you to think of it maybe inspire you to think of some more options and i think that we should all just take a few minutes now to ah think about these options so i am going to give you
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00107	2 or 3 minutes maybe just to think about some more options that each of us could think about to have more impact for animals and the idea here is some really rough brainstorming
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00108	thinking about different options and and then we will go on to the next stage i am going to pause for a 2nd so everyone think about your options
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00111	also going to ah tips next screen how you think about your options and
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00113	but a little bit of inspiration and
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00115	and so obviously that was not enough time for you all to generate as many options as is possible for each of you but hopefully it is giving you some inspiration or at least started to make you think about more options that are potential for you
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00116	so after this the next step that we want to take is ranking these options
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00117	so i will i will share these slides and on the facebook group afterwards so that you can all like spend some some real time thinking about them but the idea is just to try and get you
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00118	ah into the space of generating some more options and the next step is to rank your options
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00119	so again i want you to do just like a really rough initial ranking of your options through through just introspection and not try and think too much about it but the the idea would be to take those
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00120	take all the priorities that we discussed in step 2 and think about the options that we have just generated and rank them against each other so which ones seem like the likely
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00121	and highest opportunity just based on intuition not through doing any research or anything like that but where we think each one of those options maybe would come through the through the ranking
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00123	and again i am just giving you all of the priorities of that and i would just leave them on and if you can can just really quickly look at those options that you have just done and and rank them and against those different
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00125	so now maybe one of the most ah particularly important things is to list our key uncertainties
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00126	and so the idea is that if you have actually gone through this workshop with me and you have done as i have said then you can get to the point now where you might have been thinking in the last stages like
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00127	what are the things that what are your reservations like what are really holding you back from being able to do that initial ranking
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00128	and from generating those ideas and and these key uncertainties actually are quite significant because
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00129	they can change the entire dimension of everything you have just been doing so you can think about things and think okay we i have got a really concrete ranking but what are the types of things one of the key uncertainties that you have
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00130	that would actually likely change the initial ah rankings that you have done and so again just like trying to think about these things is actually really important and and i am going to i am going to pause now for 5 minutes and let you think
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00131	really concretely about those steps and then after that we are going to go into breakout rooms which martin is going to help me to assign and just to ah we are going to put you in different groups
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00132	and depending on on way you get assign you will have that kind of assignment but if we can spend 5 minutes now individually just thinking about all these things and i will leave some texts on the screen again and so that you can you can have some time
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00134	welcome back so sorry for the messa loine ah it was not as easy as i thought i could not pick all the information broadcast so it took me some time to figure it out but i hope it was delivered
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00135	yeah i i hope it was as useful as i got to speech to someone and she was quite fantastic so i hope that everyone else had had a good time
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00136	can i just check that and can you see my screen or not i am not a 100% sure this this point
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00137	we can see you but not your screen yet
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00138	okay
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00139	slightly and helpful okay anyway i have got it i think and i do not think i have that access anymore to to share but anyway
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00140	we are just going to move over to the q and a session and i just wanted to to say before we did that
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00141	that hopefully people have found the ah the workshop really useful and
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00142	or marginally useful and i got something out of it and i just wanted to to say that we do have more resources available on our website and we also have ah 2 things that people can do following this
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00143	and so one is apply for our one to one career advising and calls and in that people will fill an application process which seems quite arduous and long but is is actually helped
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00144	try and is actually developed to try and get people to introspect a little bit and and to think through their career and then we can use that as a form for for the call as well
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00145	em and then the 2nd is that we are going to be doing an introductory course at the end of this well actually in a couple of months time and that is just to help people understand a little bit more about effective animal
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00146	advocacy movement and the opportunities that are available to people and then we will do ah a more structured and detailed workshop than the one that you had today so you can also apply for that and
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00147	website and but i think that is pretty much everything from from my side if we will not have any questions that we can fire away that is totally fine
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00149	great thank you lauren so now we can open a q and a session we have 12 minutes or almost 12 minutes i would like to remind you to not ask the question directly keep your mic muted
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00150	and post your questions to slide though or you should find the link to slide though ah in the chat and it will be put there again in a few moments
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00151	and we already have 2 questions there so let us start with the 1st question ah hi is it possible to work as an independent researcher within e a a
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00152	ah like applying for funding to do research projects as an individual individual rather than with an organization
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00154	i am really sorry could you repeat the question
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00155	okay sorry about that so is it possible the work work as an independent researcher within effective animal advocacy
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00156	ah that means applying for funding to do research projects as an individual rather than with an organization
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00158	yeah i think that that would definitely be a potential option and i think that there are some funding resources available for individual projects i think it would it would really
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00159	specifically depend on what project it was that you were trying to research and but there are definitely some some grant making bodies and organizations that will fund individuals to to research
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00160	particularly on priority areas i think the effective animal effective altruism and
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00161	community does you find these things i have heard of know i hope that answers the question but if you have a follow up feel free to ask
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00163	okay next question from helen ah what was your career path before launching this new cool organization
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00164	thanks helen ah yes so my career path before before this is i i have worked in the for profit world for almost 10 years before i did this
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00165	and and i worked as a client manager and and then ended up in consultancy and when i was doing that i was also volunteering
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00166	for effective animal advocacy organizations like the human league and the good food institute and i really enjoyed that work that was potentially the most exciting part of my job even though it was not my job
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00167	and that inspired me to start church entrepreneurship which i think you also on and then i thought this organization
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00169	thank you the next question is from ula zalosa ah who would benefit the most from the individual calls that a c c is providing
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00171	and yeah that is a really good question i do not think there is a most ah but i think that it would be beneficial to
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00172	and anybody who kind of wants to think a little bit more in ah in a structured way about their career
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00173	and the the actual application form itself is quite is quite long and sorry about that but it is it is therefore to try and help get to get people to really think about their career
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00174	and and it would be beneficial i think for anybody who is uncertain about any aspect of their career and would just like to speak a little bit more about it
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00175	and we can give you feedback on it and hopefully give you some more and tailored and individual resources to to help you with your career decision
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00177	thank you next question is from matilda da rui i apologize if i miss pronoun that ah do you have any pointers on how to get how to go about assessing relative fit
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00179	ah assessing relative fit ah yeah i mean i think i think that really i think that one of the the most important things to do in assessing your relative
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00180	fit is to be quite ah brutal with yourself and introspect a lot and you could also ask other individuals i know some people and start those anonymous feedback forms
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00181	and and i know my friends have actually and if if you are the kind person that can take feedback i do not want like advise that you want to to try and get feedback if it is going to affect them negatively in that in their mental health
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00182	but it can be quite useful to actually ask people that you know to give you to give you feedback so that you can really get a better
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00183	and objective ah view of your specific skill sets and then you can quite accurately probably assess your relative fit another thing that you can do is do some volunteering
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00184	and for specific roles that you are considering and and that will give you a pretty good idea of whether you would like or not like ah those roles i did volunteer once as a researcher and and
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00185	it did not it did not fit very well with me so i am really glad i am very grateful for my co founder jamie who does the the more various side of research because i knew that that would not have been
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00186	ah a very good fit for me and prior to that i thought i would have been a fantastic researcher so and volunteering can be very helpful
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00188	thank you i would like to remind others that in slide though you can vote for the questions you find most interesting ah it is the preferred way of doing this because we have ah several questions and only 7 minutes left
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00189	so we will not be able to go through all of them ah the next question is if you want to work in a plan based campaigning on institutional level
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00190	what kind of university degree would be useful or what skills would be useful to learn
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00192	ah yeah that is a really good question and very specific and i do not think that i would be the best person to ask that for because i do not have that background and so for me to to kind of like answer that question would probably be misdirected
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00193	and i think that if you were to use the community directory which i think i referenced before there will probably be somebody who actually specifically worked in that space
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00194	and can probably tell that tell you about their career trajectory and how they got there and which ones are and are more more useful than are the ones and
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00196	if that is okay soon answer
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00198	okay thank you let us get to the next one ah do you have any tips for how to cheaply explore social scientific research related to effective animal advocacy and alternative protein startups
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00200	again that is a very specific question i have not an answer for that i am really sorry and but i think i like the the general thing would be that if you have a really really specific question about a particular career
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00201	and role i would really encourage you to reach out to somebody who has got a background in that because they will have the the best advice and and unfortunately as a new organization we have only been going for like a year
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00202	we have only researched into a specific area at the moment and overall career strategy and very specific questions would probably be better directed
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00203	to see who has significantly more experience in a specific role
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00205	okay thank you next question how lengthy is the process involved in applying for individual career counseling calls
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00207	can you just repeat that
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00208	how lengthy is the process involved in applying for individual career counseling calls
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00209	yeah so it is a 5050% chance that you will get you will get onto the career advising call and the reason is so that we can ah we can accurately assess whether it is actually been useful for people to have career advising
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00210	at this year so it is it is not based on the actual application itself it does not matter if it is ah good or bad there is no good or bad in the application it is it is literally random chance so
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00211	and the 1st person will get either assigned to jamie or myself for a career advising call
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00212	and the 2nd person will be assigned to a control ah control trial and it is not like ah an application where you can get a good or a bad result
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00214	okay next question
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00216	ah do the individual calls assume the applicants have decided to prioritize animal advocacy as a course area or can you talk about prioritization in the goals now you can definitely talk about prioritization and we would
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00217	the the idea of that our core advising course is to to help people to maximize their impact and in general and obviously it is it is nice if it is for animals and and we would like to discuss those options with people but i do not think that
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00218	if you have not decided 100% on animal advocacy i think that it would still be very interesting to have that dialog and and you can use the same type of framework usually
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00219	ah for assessing all different types of options they do not have to be specific to animal advocacy
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00221	thank you next question is from jonathan ah how is the career course experiment going ah when do you expect to have an idea on how effective the coaching is and whether you will continue with it
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00222	it is a very good question jonathan and it is going really it is going well at the moment i am i think
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00223	i mean again this is one of those things that i am sure as you know by posing that question it is very difficult to ah to get results back straightway
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00224	and at the moment we have had quite a lot of positive feedback and but what we are actually going to be doing is assessing incremental changes that people might have have made
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00225	based on the calls and it is likely that we will get initial results and after about 6 months after the calls
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00226	but likely and if you look at 80000 hours and you have seen that work and they have advised us that will probably be 2 to 3 years before really significantly understand
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00227	and whether we have had any impact or not and which is why it is only one of the few things that we are experimenting in this year
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00229	thank you
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00231	ah next question is from andrea ah how should we find a job in animal rights research if their errant are not so many open vacancies
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00233	really good question and i think as i said when we were actually doing our spot check and research
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00234	it does seem that some roles are a lot more competitive than other ones and research is definitely one of them
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00235	and then campaigning is another and so in that situation there is just a lot of people and there is there is not enough roles
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00236	and what i would suggest ah would be to work on the generating options and idea because it could be that if long term you want to do research
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00237	and that could that is definitely still a plausible path but it might just be that at the moment initially there are not the research roles available and so i would really encourage you to look into other options that you have more immediately
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00238	and if your long term is is thinking about having a career in research to look for more immediate options that can help you get towards that goal
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00239	and at the end and and not to focus too much on not getting specific opportunities right now
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00241	thank you and we have time for one last question and we have only one love question is like do so this is the fortunate ah the last question is what do you envision animal advocacy careers are doing in 5 years
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00243	that is a really good question that is a really really good question and the the easy answer to that would be doing the most important thing that we can not help individuals maximize that impact for animals
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00244	and the the the slightly harder question answer would be that i really do not know that is why we are we are testing different things
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00245	and as much as possible and experimenting on a small scale and so we can try and work out how we are helping how we can help em individuals
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00246	and so as much feedback would be gratefully accepted whether it is positive or negative we really appreciate that because it helps us to to be more effective in the long term
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00248	okay thank you very much lauren we are out of question and out of time i think for the rest of us it is time to unmute ourselves and give lauren a short run round of applause
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00250	0 thank you it is really nice to expect me
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00002	welcome to the cadfem medical conference 2021 from me i am jan hertwig the c e 0 of cadfem medical and i am very happy that so much ah participants join here today
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00003	and i would like to thank all the purses participants and speakers that have joined
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00004	so we are now looking forward to very exciting afternoon with great presentations on computational modeling in in medicine and medical technology and in silico methods in health in the healthcare industry please enjoy
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00006	for the opening of the cadfem medical conference 2021 i will what invite you to a short look on what we do and achieve with our partners at cadfem medical
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00007	so at cadfem medical our vision is to be the number one enabler for in silico medicine we want to provide physicians and patients access to in silico methods
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00008	so with our mission to transfer simulation technologies from automotive and aerospace to healthcare we want to enhance the well being of patients
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00009	so to do so we deeply believe in the use of numerical simulation to detect diseases improve therapies and enhance the product safety of medical devices
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00010	all of our products has the roots and research projects and with academia and universities
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00011	so for example docq r p e for the surgical planning of forced maxillary expansions ah developed together with clinic in dortmund k l s martin and the university of witten herdecke
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00012	and also docq also for the diagnosis and therapy of obstructive sleep apnea it is also an universal and grant funded research project
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00013	and docq v i t for the digital verification of custom implants also so all our products are based on on research and universal research to test and to really verify our models and our ideas
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00015	and to bring these innovations from academia and research to industrial applications we develop docq so our scalable in silico platform enabling doctors in medtech use ansys simulation technologies in predefined medical workflows
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00016	so every specific medical question is always transferred into a so called docq module so the blue cube you can see in the middle
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00017	and each module is a product with a specific intended use which then can operate autonomous together with the platform docq core in green
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00018	so through our partnership with microsoft we are delivering a very scalable infrastructure enabling unrestricted and easy to use access to our products and ansys solvers in verified infrastructures on azure
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00019	and to give a better idea of how we use america simulation to add value i will show you some examples and benefits of the modules based on our docq platform
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00021	1st of all docq osa to support the diagnosis and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea and sleep related breathing disorders
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00022	so it supports the diagnosis and therapy with computational fluid dynamics and fluid structure into action
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00023	with docq also it is possible for a physician to visualize the characteristics of an upper airway and determine the anatomical and biomechanical causes and the area of the respiratory problem for a patient
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00024	really objectifying the root causes and approved the communication of the treatment options to the patient
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00025	and currently we are in a patient study with over 60 patients together with our clinical partner clinic in dortmund and we are aiming for c mark in early 2023
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00027	the next example is docq r p e it is a software for surgical planning of so called forced maxillary distractions so it calculates the optimal cutting patterns ensuring ah
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00028	symmetrical phase after and during the forced widening of the upper jaw so the problem with this procedure is very simple so nearly everyone has a symmetrical or asymmetrical anatomy
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00029	so meaning different bone thicknesses in the skull for the forced opening of the upper jaw so called distractor is positioned in the upper jaw and applies a symmetrical force onto the bone parts
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00030	and symmetric bone weakening cuts will be introduced in the maxilla normally and left and right with the same length so this can result in an asymmetric opening of the maxilla meaning one side of the upper jaw moves more than the opposite side
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00031	so with docq r p e k l s martin can calculate the optimal cutting patterns and generate the cutting guide for the surgeon so they can rely on consistent quality of patient care and the best surgical outcomes
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00033	and and the really nice thing on top of the reduction of the trauma for the patient through shorter cuts and remaining blood vessels the symmetric outcome and the better esthetics for the patient
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00034	is there is a possibility to individualize an off the shelf medical device
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00035	so k l s martin can give an added value by selling an hybrid product a standardized hardware product plus a personalized digital planning with simulation
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00037	and with the 3rd example coming from academia
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00038	docq v i t v i t stands for virtual implant testing we want to help and make medical devices safer
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00039	so we saw a big trend and personalized and a personalization of medical devices and if medical devices are personalized they are unique and produced just once so that means they cannot be tested like standard medical devices
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00040	so in the production process of these custom implants
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00041	ah usually they acquire patient data do a surgical planning to get it with a doctor via web meeting do an implant design by by a designer or in a p 0 c so a point of care center and a clinic
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00042	and then do the implant manufacturing with milling 3 d printing etcetera and a post processing steps
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00043	and sending it to surgery normally that happens within ah a 2 to 8 days from data acquisition to to sending the results
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00044	and there is already a lot of quality management necessary in the manufacturing and post processing and a lot of quality management and has get into technical documentation
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00045	but where it is really important and where the safety and efficacy of a device for a patient is determined it is in the surgical planning and implant design but there is no possibility to test your devices for each patient
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00046	and there docq v i t comes in so we developed to fill this gap docq v i t and digital design verification and an automated reporting of the results for the technical documentation
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00048	so in a nutshell docq v i t is an easy to use software for digital verification of custom implants
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00049	and we can apply physiological and standardized loads to patient specific situations and basic basic patient specific implants and reduce the liability based on objective criteria
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00050	and ensure the safety and efficacy with highly complex biomechanical simulations so at the moment workflows are available for the maxilla the mandible the thorax and soon for the lower arms
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00052	and what that make made happen is really research and and a lot of effort and in our platform
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00053	and to sum it up with our platform docq we want to really provide an ecosystem for in silico technologies and for academia and other companies so we do not
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00055	or we want the companies and and academia do not reinvent the wheel
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00056	because docq is providing already a scalability a working infrastructure the regulatory framework the base technologies such as ansys solvers 3 d rendering dicom and data handling user management etcetera etcetera
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00057	and we know that there are are great ideas and solutions being developed in research and industry and together we can further develop them and make them available for patients and doctors
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00059	so thank you for attention and a big thank you to our partners speakers and panelists today and feel free to contact us and please enjoy the afternoon thank you very much
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00001	i welcome you to this presentation entitled citizen attitudes towards genome editing and farm animals
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00003	we asked around 3700 citizens from austria canada germany italy and the u s on this topic and we collected our data on line between may and november 2019
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00004	our 1st research question is are different applications of genome editing right or wrong to do from a citizen is perspective
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00005	we included 5 different applications of genome editing in the study 3 of them referred to disease resistance within different species
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00006	namely h i v resistance in humans mildew resistance in wheat plants and resistance to purse in pigs
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00007	the other 2 applications referred to editing cattle do produce allergen free milk and to increase muscle growth in cattle
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00009	each study participant was randomly assigned to one of the 5 applications and read a short introductory text about genome editing and the specific application
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00011	this figure shows how participants respond to the question whether they think it is right or wrong to use genome editing for the application they just read about
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00012	answers could be given on a 7 point likert scale ranging from one absolutely wrong to do up to 7 absolutely right to do
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00014	the application being the most right to do is the h i v resistance in humans followed by mildew resistance in wheat plants
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00015	the 3 applications dealing with editing farm animals are perceived as being less right in the order of resistance and pigs towards purse editing cattle to produce allergen free milk
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00016	and the increased muscle growth in cattle is perceived as wrong on average
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00017	the order of applications is the same in all countries whereas we observe the german and austrian participants being a bit more skeptical compared to the other countries
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00019	our 2nd research question was whether we can find different groups of participants according to their attitudes towards genome editing
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00021	indeed we were able to find 4 different groups of participants the strong supporters here in dark green think that genome editing is right to do they perceive little risks
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00022	high benefits and do not think that the technology is tempering with nature the opponents in red think that genome editing is really wrong to do they perceive high risks
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00023	low benefits and think that it is tempering with nature the other 2 clusters are in between these 2 groups
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00025	the results of the cluster analysis show that they are quite diverse groups of people with regard to their attitudes to genome editing
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00027	thank you very much for listening and i am looking forward to your questions and comments and please be free to contact me for this
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00002	hi my name is coleman stavish and i am the chief technology officer at proscia a software company in the field of cancer research and diagnostics
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00003	today i will be talking about how a w s proscia and the joint pathology center have joint forces to advance the practice of pathology
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00005	in today is session i will introduce proscia and share how our concentric platform helps to address fundamental challenges in the pathology industry we will also look at the joint pathology center and its trailblazing initiative in digital transformation
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00006	and throughout the session i will touch on how partnership with a w s makes all this possible
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00008	proscia is mission is perfect cancer diagnosis with intelligent software that changes the way the world practices pathology
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00010	we built a software platform that supports pathologies transition from analog to digital which can accelerate discovery in life sciences research and improve clinical outcomes
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00012	proscia was founded in 2014 and is backed by a strong group of venture capital and strategic investors today proscia platform is trusted by leading biopharma companies contract research organizations hospital systems and economic medical centers
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00014	let us take a step back briefly and look at pathology as a field
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00016	this is an image of a pathologist desk
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00018	100s of glass slides in trays awaiting review under a microscope and antiquated technology this field of medicine has not fundamentally changed in over a century and is in dire need of a transformation
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00020	further the practice of pathology is inherently subjective
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00022	pathologist concordance can be as low as 54% which means in some sensitive areas of diagnosis and prognosis 2 pathologists may disagree with each other about half the time
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00023	what that means practically is that a patient could be undertreated or overtreated based on that diagnosis leading to potentially poor outcomes for the patient and increased costs of the healthcare system
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00024	at the same time pathologists and the labs they work for are under intense economic pressure globally labs do not have enough staff to meet increasing demand with a global pathologist workforce shrinking
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00025	and the pathologist workload exploding over the past decade as a quick checkpoint it is sometimes useful to compare pathology to radiology which underwent its own digital transformation 2 decades ago or so
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00026	while there are some parallels between the 2 specialties pathology images are on on average 10 times larger averaging 2 gigabytes per image sometimes as large as 30 gigabytes or more
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00027	of course this presents a considerable challenge from an it standpoint ensuring that storage and compute infrastructure can scale to support what is on track to become one of the most data intensive fields of medicine
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00028	a w s and its broad solution portfolio has been an excellent partner to proscia and many customers practicing digital pathology at scale
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00029	powering pathologies shift to digital are 3 technology pillars 1st slides are digitized using whole slide scanners which take a glass slide and produce a digital image for pathology review
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00030	and those images are managed in an image management system
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00032	after an image is created it can be analyzed by one or more computational applications or algorithms intended to aid the pathologists or scientists
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00034	proscia builds the image management system concentric and also has a portfolio of add on applications
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00036	proscia is concentric platform lives at the center of the pathology ecosystem
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00038	concentric runs natively on a w s to manage all pathology data in the cloud for high scalability while keeping costs under control
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00040	concentric integrates with 3rd party solutions to deliver a best in class experience for digital pathology pulling images in from any slide scanner and patient data from the laboratory information system
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00042	concentric provides pathologist with their portal for reading images and rendering diagnoses and enables instant remote consultation with experts around the world
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00044	concentric is designed to use a w s offerings such as s 3 object storage with intelligent cheering
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00046	r d s and e c 2 instances with auto scaling to support the high and sometimes variable demands of digital pathology
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00048	now i would like to shift gears and introduce the joint pathology center which is the pathology center of excellence for the united states military and other federal entities
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00050	the j p c is mission is 2 fold 1st to deliver the highest quality pathology consultation and education
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00051	and 2nd to grow and preserve the world is largest tissue bio parts of repository for biomedical research as the steward of the world is largest human tissue bank
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00052	containing over 55000000 glass slides dating back over a century the j p c has embarked on an incredibly exciting digital transformation to digitize its vast slide archive to promote novel research
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00054	and to streamline its pathology practice for consultation
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00056	at proscia we are honored to deliver our concentric platform to the j p c to support their effort and a w s govcloud was also selected to support this project through its strong compliance measures scalability and ease of deployment
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00058	as an aside the joint pathology centers groundbreaking project was recently featured on 60 minutes the segment highlighted the tremendous value in being able to search a vast and diverse archive of disease to combat endemics and other public health crises
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00060	i would encourage anyone to look up the segment if interested as i have mentioned previously i t infrastructure is a crucial piece to the digitization of pathology a w s cloud provides customers an efficient solution right out of the box
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00061	1st offering security for sensitive health care and biopharma information regulatory compliance scalable infrastructure for fast growing and high volume data sets
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00062	enabling collaboration for more efficient remote work which is of of course become increasingly important over the past year and finally cost effectiveness making adoption easier initially in enabling future expansion
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00064	in summary best in class software coupled with flexible scalable and secure i t infrastructure are required to build a future pathology proscia and a w s are proud to partner to deliver solutions that help our customers realize this vision
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00066	thank you for listening

YTB+npZWztwSMAk+00078	certainly strengthens and unfolds our own inner urge to become a more compassionate doctor or even more importantly a more compassionate human being
YTB+npZWztwSMAk+00079	love all serve all thank you
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00001	ascertain that the patient is the right candidate for the procedure then the next step is the radiological planning which will be discussed in this video one should know exactly how much is the varus or valgus deformity whether the deformity is in the tibia or femur or both
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00002	how much correction should be undertaken are you going to correct in the tibia or femur or in both the steps in radiological planning for high tibial osteotomy are obtaining proper x rays and analyzing them radiological planning
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00003	intra operative verification and finally obtaining a good result a standing full length x ray with the patient bearing weight on both the limbs is very crucial for planning for osteotomy
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00004	the x ray source is positioned 10 feet away from the patient and a long cassette can be used or a cassette deck as shown in the image with an image processing software can also be used
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00005	the x ray beam is centered on the knee and the exposure would be around 85 to 105 kilovolts the x ray image will always be downsized and to know the original measurements placement of an object with a known size is important
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00006	a metallic sphere is preferable as it casts a round shadow always here a metallic ball of 3 centimeters which is embedded in a cloth velcro belt is tied around the lower 3rd of thigh in level with the bone in the sagittal section
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00007	the patient is patella should be facing forward in the anterior superior iliac spine should be at the same level any limb length discrepancy noted should be addressed by keeping planks under the shorter leg
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00008	a properly exposed scannagram should be examined for the central position of patella the lateral tibial margin should cross the fibula at the widest part of fibula there should be a 13rd overlap of fibula by tibia
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00009	the distal femur and joint line should be clearly visible without any overlap in planning we are concerned primarily with mechanical axes anatomical axes of a long bone is a line that divides the shaft into 2 halves
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00010	the mechanical axis of the femur connects the center of the femoral head and the center of the inner condylar notch in the tibia is a line connecting the center of the tibial articular surface with the center of the ankle joint
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00011	in femur the anatomical and mechanical axes are different with a 6 to 7 degrees variation in tibia both are almost same with the anatomical axis being 3 to 4 millimeters medial to the mechanical axis
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00012	the mechanical axis of the entire lower limb also called the mikulicz line runs from the center of the femoral head to the center of the ankle joint under physiological conditions this line runs on an average of 4 millimeters medial to the center of the knee joint
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00013	when this line is displaced more than 10 millimeters laterally or more than 15 millimeters medially then it is called a significant mechanical axis deviation
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00014	in this video we will consider the varus deformity primarily varus deformity could be produced by deformities in tibia or femur erosion of medial joint laxity of lateral ligament structures and following malunited intra articular fractures
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00015	the mechanical axis deviation would indicate a significant varus but to understand the origin of the varus
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00016	it is important to know and calculate these 2 measurements medial proximal tibial angle shortened as m p t a and lateral distal femoral angle shortened as l d f a
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00017	the m p t a is the angle formed by the mechanical axis of the tibia with the tangential line to the tibial articular surface its normal value is 87 degrees with a deviation of 3 degrees
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00018	any decrease in the value indicates that the origin of varuses from the tibia the l d f a
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00019	is the angle formed by the mechanical axis of the femur with the tangential line to the distal femoral articular surface and once again it has the same value of 87 degrees any increase in this value indicates that the origin of varuses from the femur
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00020	once the tibia is confirmed as the source of varus the cause of the varus should be ascertained it could be a medial joint erosion it could be a metaphyseal deformity
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00021	loose lateral structures due to a previous ligament injury or stretching can cause lateral joint opening aggravating the varus very rarely the varus can be contributed by a diaphyseal deformity
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00022	in many cases the metaphyseal varus can be measured by calculating the tibial bone varus angle
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00023	it is the angle formed between the epiphysial axis the line that is perpendicular to the line that connects the medial and lateral ends of the epiphysial scar line and the mechanical axis of tibia a t b v a more than 5 degrees indicates a metaphyseal varus
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00024	h t 0 gives the best results if done for a metaphyseal deformity as it corrects the deformity and restores normal morphology it gives the best outcomes
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00025	on the other hand an h t 0 in a normal proximal tibial morphology can induce a new deformity even though unloading is achieved it is important to understand the varus produced by lateral joint opening due to excess laxity of the lateral ligament structures
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00026	one should not correct this component of varus and bone the joint line convergence angle is the angle between the tangentials to the distal femoral and distal tibial articular surfaces up to 2 degrees is normal
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00027	any value more than that should be subtracted from the overall varus correction fujisawa point is a popular landmark for shifting the weight bearing line which was inferred from a retrospective series
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00028	it is not necessary to shift the weight bearing line to fujisawa point in all cases
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00029	mostly we aim to achieve a 2 or 3 degree of valgus to achieve that the weight bearing line has shifted just lateral to the lateral tibial spine
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00031	but depending on the prevailing osteoarthritic changes the weight bearing line can be shifted further laterally to unload the medial compartment much more effectively
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00032	we know the deformity angles and degrees but we need to know the size of opening wedge in millimeters to complete the osteotomy we have few methods which will help us derive the exact height of the osteotomy wedge in millimeters
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00033	the miniaci method is the one which is popularly used in a weight bearing x ray the existing weight bearing line is drawn the correction point is chosen according to the existing osteoarthritic changes
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00034	and the hinge point is also marked on the lateral tibial cortex the new weight bearing line is drawn through the correction point the new weight bearing line should be of the same length as the old weight bearing line
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00035	the distal end of the new line is connected to the hinge and then on to the center of the ankle joint the angle made at the hinge point is noted at this stage if there is a soft tissue varus any j l c a more than 2 degrees should be subtracted from this angle measurement
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00036	a triangle with a hinge point is the apex with the result an angle is drawn the base of the triangle gives the measurement for the opening wedge since the x rays are downsized it is important to calibrate at this stage
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00037	now the metallic sphere is measured and the calibration ratio is found out and is applied to the measurement which gives the real life opening distance in millimeters one can also use various softwares for radiological planning
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00038	but one should be aware of plotting mistakes intra observer and inter observer variations
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00039	another pitfall one should be aware is the intraarticular deformity of tibia as following a malunited medial tibial fracture or a blount is disease resulting in a pagoda tibia here the joint surfaces are incongruent and the patient walks with severe varus thrust
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00040	here an intraarticular osteotmy to lift only the medial tibial condyle is appropriate doing h t 0 in this situation can result in a teether effect with a poor result
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00042	another pitfall would be to miss the varus deformity due to soft tissue laxity this would typically result in an overcorrection as the soft tissue laxity collapses once the knee goes for valgus
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00043	in major corrections over 12 millimeters the resultant m p t a angles should be calculated an m p t a of 94 degrees would be acceptable in a correction
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00044	anything more would result in joint shear and can result in poor long term outcomes distributing the correction across both femur and tibia in a double level osteotomy would prevent joint obiquity
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00045	the tibia normally slopes down posteriorly by 7 to 9 degrees ideally one should not change the tibial slope during an h t 0
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00046	however one must remember that the opening wedge osteotomy has a tendency to increase the slope and a closing wedge osteotomy has a tendency to decrease the slope
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00047	in a a c l deficient is knee the slope should not be increased and in a p c l deficient knee the slope should not be decreased not only patient selection but careful radiological planning is crucial for the success of high tibial osteotomy
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00048	one should always resist a tendency to eyeball or depend on interoperative checks like diathermic cable or long rods parallax and positioning errors can lead to significant mistakes always rely on your pre operative planning values
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00049	h t 0 is a procedure of perfections it starts from taking perfect x rays to careful execution thanks for your attention
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00001	hello all my name is kevin deane i am a rheumatologist here at the division of rheumatology
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00002	my talk today is going to be a update of a talk i gave back in 2016 i have changed the title to now be updates in the prevention of rheumatoid arthritis
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00004	i have some disclosures around grant funding and consulting from industry
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00006	and then i think these slides are available for everybody but here is a couple of evidence based reviews that talk in much more detail about what i am going to talk about today
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00008	so the disease that i am focusing on here is rheumatoid arthritis it is an immune disease that primarily affects the joints
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00010	certainly can affect other things including the lungs and it is one of the most disabling forms of arthritis it is also highly prevalent in the population as far as autoimmune disease goes up
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00011	about one of the population and i updated this slide from 2016 i i just have to laugh a little bit about the number of name changes our our bronco stadium has gone through
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00012	ah hopefully i got this right is now empower field but one of population so if you were at a football game that would be little over a section full of people with rheumatoid arthritis so pretty pretty dramatic a number of people with this autoimmune disease
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00014	so it it is associated with a lot of things for an individual with disease pain fatigue loss of function there is also extra articular manifestations heart disease is actually one of the biggest
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00015	killers prematurely in rheumatoid arthritis so folks with rheumatoid arthritis get heart disease about 10 years earlier than they would if they did not have rheumatoid arthritis
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00016	there is medication toxicity very expensive there is actually overall reduced life spans so it is a very impactful disease
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00018	the current paradigm of how we identify and treat rheumatoid arthritis is to treat the disease once it is clinically apparent
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00019	which is once somebody has started to have joint symptoms pain stiffness or swelling made it through their primary care gotten an evaluation
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00021	figured out that they might have some kind of inflammatory arthritis finally referred to rheumatology and finally made a diagnosis which that process has been looked at in the united states takes on average 2 years from the onset of symptoms to the final diagnosis of treatment for rheumatoid arthritis
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00023	that is too long the disease actually damages within the 1st few months of disease so an overall premise that i am going to build on here is what if we could find r a
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00024	and stop it before people actually started having joint damage i will talk a bit a bit about the rationale for that statement and that idea and then talk about what we are doing to try and do that
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00026	so we now know that rheumatoid arthritis has a staged or phased set of things that happen in terms of development here is a picture
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00027	ah which point someone would show up in clinic and get diagnosed but now we know from a variety of studies that i will not go through in each detail in short time today that there is a preclinical or pre r a period
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00028	this happens long before this and on average 3 to 5 years but it can be up to 15 to 17 years in some studies where genes
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00029	environmental exposures combined to 1st trigger a period of asymptomatic autoimmunity and inflammation that is detectable with blood tests or other tests
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00030	now we are we are realizing that these tests can be abnormal in mucosal surfaces as well
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00032	person can progress start developing early symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis but nothing you could define it in a clinical exam i e you would not see a swollen joint then it finally comes to the point where there are signs and symptoms and you could say yes this person has inflammatory arthritis
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00033	and then ultimately classify them as having r a and start treatment
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00035	so i am going to focus the rest of the talk on this preclinical also called pre r a period and what is happening in that period and how we are how we are planning to intervene to try and prevent the onset of this clinically apparent disease
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00037	so ah ah ah 1st little digression here is to help understand how we know about rheumatoid arthritis and how we measure it is going to develop in an individuals there is there is auto antibodies i think people are familiar with these
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00038	there is 2 big systems that we think about in terms rheumatoid arthritis there is rheumatoid factors been identified for decades
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00039	there is a newer newer system that we may be less familiar with it is called acpa or antibodies to citrullinated protein or peptide antigens depending who you talk to but acpa
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00040	the clinical term that we use for the clinical assays that is available in all the labs is called a c c p so acpa serves an umbrella term c c p is the specific clinical term what this measures is antibodies
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00041	to post translationally modified our genes into citrulline so we all make citrulline in our body all the time it comes along with inflammation it comes along with normal progression one of the things
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00042	the the reasons we often do not have webbed fingers is because citrullination occurs within cells and it causes those cells to be orderly
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00043	and and reabsorbed so so it is part of our normal physiology but unusual is autoimmunity to citrulline proteins that is highly specific for rheumatoid arthritis
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00045	just to it get into the weeds a little bit but it does help me explain some things a little bit later the commercial assays
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00046	for antibiotics to citrullinated protein are called c c p they actually measure
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00047	antibodies to a whole variety of of citrullinated proteins citrullinated vimentin fibrinogen other things but it just gives you a one readout so just a a level
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00048	we can actually break that apart in into research assays where we can actually look at antibodies to specific citrullinated proteins and actually count them up and say 0 an individual has reactivity to 8 citrullinated proteins or 10
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00049	that is going to help understand how how we have understood rheumatoid arthritis but the commercial assay does not tell you that just gives you kind of one readout that is a little bit about the antibodies
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00050	now here is the my most complicated slide to tell you how we think rheumatoid arthritis develops i will walk you through this one to make sure we understand it so these
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00051	are images from a group of individuals who have blood collected on average
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00052	10 years before they get rheumatoid arthritis and then after they got diagnosis and on the left hand side are people who develop rheumatoid arthritis on the right hand side are serial match controls we got these folks from the department of
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00053	defense serum repository which is a great resource of family who wants to talk about how you can look at natural history of disease i can i can inform you about that offline
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00054	basically if an individual in the military develops rheumatoid arthritis you can go find them and then go back in time and find blood that has been collected through this department of defense serum collection system and look at blood before they get disease so that is a background to this slide
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00055	individuals on the left hand panel we will focus there developed rheumatoid arthritis at this time point
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00057	and then these are sort of intervals before they developed rheumatoid arthritis this is ah back to that point i made earlier you can measure individual antibodies to a variety of citrulline antigenes if you just squint at this slide
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00058	you can see that the red color increases over time that means individuals are developing more and more
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00059	auto antibodies to a variety of citrullinated proteins they start off with very few they get more and more and more and progress to the point where they get already have a lot of auto antibodies and then this is that threshold they cross and develop clinical apparent disease so
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00061	following it also there is an elevation of inflammation that goes along with it yyou will not be able to read this but there is a whole list of cytokines down below if you can kind of squint the red
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00062	colors increase over time to the point at which rheumatoid arthritis clinically develops and you can see there is a basically storm of inflammation through a variety cytokine
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00064	importantly this does not happen in in folks who do not get rheumatoid arthritis so you can just look at the red colors on the right hand panels here there is not that increase of redness so this is really unique and specific for rheumatoid arthritis
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00066	there is of course other immune systems that are going abnormal in this period there is rheumatoid factors also developing along with these antibiotics citrullinated proteins there is a whole host of new antibody systems that we are learning about as we go i will not go into that in great detail
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00067	there is growing number of cellular studies in this period as well and kind of a layperson level we one can think of this is a little bit of inflammation at a candle level
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00068	probably 5 to 10 years before you get rheumatoid arthritis a campfire level a couple of years before and finally full blown fire which is the clinical disease of rheumatoid arthritis
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00070	so you can start trimming this down and looking at this in a little bit clearer away and if you just count the number of acpa i i referring back a couple slides back where an individual can have antibodies to one citrullinated protein or another if you just count those up
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00072	what happens is people start off with a low number of antibody citrullinated proteins that increases over time to the point at which they get rheumatoid arthritis if you count the number of cancer elevated that increases over time
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00074	in importantly understanding that model of how how r a has developed has led to ways to use antibodies to predict who is going to get rheumatoid arthritis in the future
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00075	and it can be boiled down even more simply with the c c p assay and i will not go into the details here but
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00076	one of the more common assays is a c c p 3 which is just a commercial version we can use one single assay that gives you a single readout levels can go
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00077	from very low or what would be considered normal increase over time cross the threshold at which point they are considered +and then increase in a person finally develops rheumatoid arthritis
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00078	this makes prediction quite simple because one can now use one commercial assay and say what is your level and then get an estimate of your overall risk for rheumatoid arthritis as well as
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00080	what time period in the near future you may develop rheumatoid arthritis so this figure kind of tells you that you can see levels can go up in the level here
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00081	is on average 2 to 4 years before somebody gets rheumatoid arthritis and this is a level which i will not show you this picture is unheard of and somebody who does not go on to get rheumatoid arthritis specific for disease and helpful in terms of timing of prediction of future disease
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00083	in fact you can boil this down to a simple model where a c c p 3 of greater than 40 units gives an overall risk of 50% for developing rheumatoid arthritis within the next 3 years
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00085	so what is helpful here is these acpa tests in particular that commercial assay c c p
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00087	is very specific for rheumatoid arthritis indeed if you have synovitis it looks like rheumatoid arthritis in this test is positive it is really over 90% specific
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00088	if you do not have synovitis there is probably a 90% positive predictive value in some case control studies
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00089	maybe as low as 30% in others but really a high positive particular values you will develop rheumatoid arthritis in the future
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00091	but certainly as i have mentioned before likelihood and timing need to be addressed in prediction that is where that model of the test being +and positive a certain level gets you both likelihood and timing of of rheumatoid arthritis now importantly this has underpinned
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00092	ah prevention studies in rheumatoid arthritis where one can go out find individuals who have elevations of these biomarkers and then intervene to try and prevent or delay them from going on to get rheumatoid arthritis
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00093	and there is a bit of a landscape of r a prevention that is evolved since i gave this talk in 2016 there was one known study which is called the dutch dexamethesone study
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00094	where individuals that had either high levels of rheumatoid factor or acpa and had aches and pains but no inflammatory arthritis were given 2 doses of dexamethasone a pretty whopping dose it did not progress then that whole progression to inflammatory arthritis
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00095	it decreased the autoantibodies a little bit but this was overall considered a negative study that was followed up by a study called prairi which was published in 2019
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00097	where people who were positive for acpa and a rheumatoid factor received one dose of the b cell depleting agent rituximab it actually did not decrease in overall progression in inflammatory arthritis but it did
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00098	slow the onset of disease so thought to be a successful trial although it was not a complete prevention a couple other studies have had readouts recently a study called stap r a
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00099	where people were given a atorvastatin to try and intervene in folks that were acpa positive to try and prevent future disease the did not work at all
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00101	the rationale behind that was because we know that atorvastatin that actually in addition to cholesterol modulating factors has some immune factors that was rational for that but did not work and so it is taken it out of the running for trying to prevent future rheumatoid arthritis
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00102	and then this is just got breaking news it is only been an abstract form in the last couple of months here a study in germany where an individual that might have acpa positivity or the c c p assay
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00103	plus evidence of inflammation in a joint on m r i but that is not something you could see on physical exam are given a drug called abatacept which is a t cell co stimulation blocker
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00104	versus a placebo and an early readout here is it is actually decreasing the progression of rheumatoid arthritis very exciting findings but that needs to be flushed out
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00106	but with that as background few years back we developed our own prevention study that we call stop r a and the big name is strategy to prevent the onset of clinically apparent rheumatoid arthritis this was funded by the n i h and n i a i d
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00107	through a special branch the autoimmunity centers of excellence we are the principal site here we developed the study but we are operating on multiple sites across the country
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00108	i think my colleagues chris striebich and mike holers and marie feser who has been our primary study coordinator here who have really helped launch this study i think all of our rheumatologists in the state
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00109	a lot of rheumatologists across the country in in a cast of 1000s which is sort of a joke but i will tell you it is not actually a joke when they when they see what we have had to do with this study
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00110	so what we did with this study ah develop an inclusion criteria of harking back to a couple slides back where we used this acpa test to c c p 3 tests that was 2 times normal
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00111	without a history of inflammatory arthritis with a projected rated development of rheumatoid arthritis 50% by 3 years we have subsequently learned that that might be a little bit of an overestimate but i think that still needs to be a a
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00112	still needs to be evaluated further that has some importance with the slide i am going to show you the next couple slides the intervention that we selected here
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00113	was a randomized blinded placebo controlled study using the drug hydroxychloroquine which is a bit of a mystery on how it works it was originally used for malaria treatment
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00114	probably because it elevates the p h inside of cells causing it to be un un unhospitable environment for for malaria
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00116	that probably also alters immune function of cells and dampens it a bit makes cells less autoreactive less inflammatory we think that is a mechanism why it works and a variety of diseases include lupus and which is used widely for
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00117	the intervention was giving the drug for one year stopping following 2 years of follow up after that to see if the drug worked was there a durable response
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00118	it was going to shoot the moon hypothesis a time limited to drug intervention in this pre clinical r a period would reset immunity lead to lasting improvement
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00119	the endpoints were development of classifiable rheumatoid arthritis which we hearken back to those pictures i showed you earlier basically a patient with swollen joints
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00120	safety was also a primary outcome study designed just real briefly an individual would come into the study get one year study drug with a few visits and then 2 years off the study drug into follow up
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00121	so we have actually completed randomization of the study and we are now in the follow up phase a couple people are still on study drug
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00122	we have randomized a 140 subjects which we revised that we were aiming for 200 to start with and some interim analyzes realized we could do with a little less people and find find a significant result
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00123	and the the study is ongoing so you you will not get a punch line here today hopefully we will have this read out very soon and i will be able to
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00124	provide us and the and the world frankly with the results from the study i will just ah spend a couple of minutes here if you are going to develop an agent that you can
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00125	put into an at risk period of disease there is a lot of considerations that have to go into that is it going to work is it going to be safe is it going to be tolerated is it going to be cost effective are people going to be willing to take it so we
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00126	considered all these things had some focus groups a few years back when we were launching the study
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00127	and we were arrived at this drug called hydroxychloroquine or plaquenil which
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00128	no one had ever heard of before covid came along and then suddenly even the president is talking about this on news conferences so what a lot of people are still aware of it
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00129	it is something we use widely in rheumatoid arthritis already if you have established disease in lupus but this the brand we chose another aspect that came into this was it was a drug that anyone
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00130	could prescribe it is pretty safe it does not really require specialist management of the agent so if it could
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00131	it is going to work it is be a great drug so this is why we are trying it as one of my colleagues chris striebich said
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00132	this is a drug that either has to succeed or fail because if we do not look at this drug as commonly used in r a people would always want it does it work because it is so safe and and if it is effective that would be a great option so this is why we looked at it
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00133	and then we will just say here is the joke side this is a a lakeside park here in denver ask me sometime offline
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00134	about using a drug hydroxychloroquine in a study that when you started it no one had ever heard of the drug and suddenly everybody wants to take the drug to prevent covid it it you know for a few months there and indeed the and n i h came to us
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00135	when it was looking early days like there was some question of whether could we look that looked like it was going to work about stopping our study and diverting all of the ah hydroxychloroquine when we had
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00136	for our study into clinical trials against covid it is hard to argue against that if it is thought to be lifesaving but fortunately that died down our our study kept going basically uninterrupted throughout the covid crisis
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00138	
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00140	so our enrollment goals for the study ah ah were actually higher and as i said we we lower that estimate we we completed enrollment our randomization for 144 subjects back in november
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00142	it was certainly a challenge so if you think a disease like harken back to that picture of the broncos stadium one of people are affected by rheumatoid arthritis so that means
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00143	maybe one people are walking around out there who are at risk for future rheumatoid arthritis it is probably even lower than that right because not everybody is actually going to get rheumatoid arthritis so the challenge is of how do you go to a
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00144	group of people find who is c c p +and going to get rheumatoid arthritis in the future and then the next part of that is how to get them to participate in the study and that has been a huge challenge of of the project for stop r a
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00145	and if i i i can not thank people enough we we thank the 17 study sites across the country that have participated as well as huge effort of the state of colorado we have had a lot of things come together to help us with
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00146	enrollment for the study we have worked closely with the 9 health fair the arthritis foundation the the campus here a lot of providers on campus who found these folks in their clinics and referred them to us a lot of room rheumatologists across the state
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00147	so a variety of ways testing 1st degree relatives or f d r of people with rheumatoid arthritis gets you a higher risk group
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00148	for future rheumatoid arthritis sometimes people show up in rheumatology clinics or primary care clinics with aches and pains and they test positive for c c p but do not have inflammation in their joints yet
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00149	and then we can do some population based approaches i have already mentioned we used the 9 health fairs here in colorado extensively other groups that have participated with us including groups in oklahoma added on a c c p test and a short consent
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00150	to about 5000 people who donated blood in in oklahoma tested them all for c c p and recruited a a large number of folks out of that group to participate in our study
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00151	we have looked at some other store biobanks at at sites including mayo clinic and brigham and women is hospital and found c c p positive that way
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00152	so the scope of this and i will just kind of boil this down in interest of time is we have tested in the past few years 30000 in individuals for c c p at 17 sites across the country
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00153	at a rate of about one.5% positive or about 450 individuals were c c p positive at a i i i left this out at a level of c c p at 2 times the normal cutoffs a little bit higher than just an average positive test
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00154	and we were able to out of that 450 people randomize the 144 or about 30% now a bunch of those folks
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00155	join the study fortunately some were willing to get tested and even been then presented with the the drug hydroxychloroquine did not really want to take a medicine because they felt well so dropped out for that ways
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00156	and a and a portion of those folks dropped out of the study because they actually wound up having undiagnosed rheumatoid arthritis and so that is some additional challenges when you get into the prevention game and start screening for people
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00157	one finding people to test the test is fortunately specific for r a so one avoids
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00158	mostly finding other conditions that you got to worry about this is a consideration especially with the r a test rheumatoid factor which can be elevated and hep
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00159	c chronic infections or malignancy so if you find somebody who is rheumatoid factor positive in absence of c c p you got to worry about all these other conditions you may have inadvertently discovered
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00160	but really c c p avoids most of that but one of the biggest challenges we have had in the study is previously undiagnosed rheumatoid arthritis in which you find somebody in the screening pathway that identify that
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00161	in in identify a pathway to care for those individuals that is a lot of ethics around that if you find somebody in your screening
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00163	that has the disease of interest and they are not good for your prevention how do you help them get to the right place
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00165	so ah this is the the cliff hanger here the interim analysis of the study is pending but we have some early data that 30% of subjects have developed rheumatoid arthritis as part in the in part of the study
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00166	that is a bittersweet finding i would just say anybody who c c p positive really does not really think they are going to get rheumatoid arthritis do not certainly does not want to get it but it is important in this prevention so it actually have people get your outcome of interest to see if your intervention can actually
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00167	lower an individual is risk for going forward so i will keep the campus in the world posted on this as we learn more in the next few months hopefully because we fully randomize and we will be able to have at least a good interim readout very soon
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00169	so
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00171	in thinking about this trial think about some of the trials that came before it or been published since we started this it is really mostly critical to learn everything we can about all aspects of prevention as we move ahead because ah
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00172	admittedly when we started this we had some grasp of the concepts that we were going to have to deal with but as we move through this the whole process there is just huge challenges in trying to identify and screen and prevent the disease
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00173	in this slide is very busy but it has a lot of the elements that have to come together i would say the most important thing is finding subjects or individuals who are at risk for disease and getting them to participate that is critically important certainly finding
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00174	funding from variety of sources getting industry to participate you can envision industry in rheumatoid arthritis as a model that is built on once you get disease it is a forever disease we got to keep giving you drugs forever
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00175	but if a prevention approach actually abrogated that or changed that industry may have a very different look at at at a disease and so you really want to have them interested in in wanting to push for prevention
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00176	measuring lots of other things including outcomes is very important getting health care systems to participate in this ultimately if we find a drug that works to prevent rheumatoid arthritis how to launch that into actual clinical care a lot of things to think about
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00177	i will say it probably the most important thing thinking about some of the drugs that we thought were going to work really well to prevent r a that was published already rituximab
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00178	steroids and then we will have to see if abatacept or this t cell co stimulation works but thinking about the basic science of this disease development do we really know what we are doing with our interventions are we making the right choices
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00180	and really this slide kind of highlights the statement here understanding the r a pathogenesis is rapidly advancing you know actually fundamentally bright change our next prevention trials
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00181	the good news is is i think we have now set in the field that you can find people who are at risk for future rheumatoid arthritis and who will get rheumatoid arthritis
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00182	think the field is also thought it is probably worthwhile trying to intervene to prevent this disease that is ah those are 2 huge hurdles now finding the right approach to prevention is is the next big step
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00183	and i just a shout out to some members of my division i think you are going to hear some other talks through the same lecture system going forward about these things including a mucosal hypothesis which i will not go into in huge detail today but to touch on this
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00184	kristi kuhn kristen demoruelle both in the division of rheumatology meagan chriswell who is a grad student has been working on this extensively have really
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00185	ah help us understand that the early phases of rheumatoid arthritis may not be in the joints at all but other sites that is i think it be groundbreaking for how we approach prevention in the future
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00187	so have a figure to kind of highlight this here ultimately when we want to think about rheumatoid arthritis how it develops and where we might be able to prevent we want to intervene in the future
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00188	with with approaches that are rooted in stage specific biology
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00190	so if we have a person who on the right hand side has joint disease and involvement in rheumatoid arthritis where we have lots of experience in developing drugs and intervening with drugs now we have taken that experience and move that all those drugs
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00191	into an earlier phase of rheumatoid arthritis hydroxychloroquine even the atorvastatin and all the other drugs i have talked about are all well studied in the articular disease of rheumatoid arthritis we are moving them and that makes a lot of sense
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00192	approval like the f d a would not approve a drug that is novel in prevention of r a unless it is already been tried in the existing disease so that helps it
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00193	so this makes a lot of sense but i think where we want to think about going forward in rheumatoid arthritis in rheumatoid arthritis prevention is understanding this propagation or systemic immune phase without the arthritis
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00194	and identify what are the novel targets in this period
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00195	precisely identify those in for given individuals maybe they are mucosal and then really what i want to say is make the punishment fit the crime so if i can ah ah
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00196	profile autoimmunity as a crime of health we want to be able to understand it and then target that appropriately so we really balance efficacy of an agent
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00197	versus risk and benefit so we do the right thing to try and prevent future disease
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00198	hopefully this will not only work for rheumatoid arthritis in the near future so we are looking for to readouts
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00199	certainly stop r a r a focus thing but we have a lot of other autoimmune or rheumatic diseases that may be following similar models of development where there is a pre disease period that we can intervene upon
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00200	i am actually trials are underway now and lupus that are similar and designed to stop r a
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00202	some studies in gout there is some studies in ankylosing spondylitis and related disease including psoriatic arthritis train
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00203	i intervene early to prevent an end organ toxicity or damage from that so it is very exciting i think many of you already know about lots of extensive work and type one diabetes so will not go into that today
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00204	but this is kind of the big dream if we can develop models to take somebody from a healthy standpoint from whatever organ you are interested in
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00205	intervene with studies such as stop r a develop ways to prevent i think that is that is where we would like to go with rheumatoid arthritis and other disease frankly i am tired as a rheumatologist to wait until sick people come into clinic if we can go out find them earlier and intervene earlier i think that is going to be great
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00207	my last slide is to think of there is too many people to put on this so i have ah thank some key people
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00209	my boss mike holers and ah jill norris his wife ah have developed a lot of these early studies and really set a foundational framework for the development of this the
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00210	the original studies were under the umbrella of the studies of the etiology of rheumatoid arthritis or sera my colleague christopher striebich and our state board who is driven forward a lot of this marie feser have been huge help kristen demoruelle kristi kuhn
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00211	our now division head duane pearson have been hugely instrumental in driving a lot of these forward we have had lots of funding from lots of agencies mostly i would like to thank the n i
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00212	a i d who have supported our stop r a trial but we are getting a lot of other institutional funding and others to to move this ahead
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00213	and with that i will stop and leave this slide and and address any questions i think i have still the last talk right i have gone a little over but hopefully there is time for questions
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00215	if there are any questions you can please enter them in the chat
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00217	i can see the chat i can see it better if i stop share so i am going to stop sharing if that is alright
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00219	natalie maybe you if you can see i do not see any questions in the chat
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00220	i do not see any either
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00222	alright i guess if nothing is coming through are we done
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00226	where do i s g fit into your evaluations
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00228	so ah what is an i s g
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00230	so interfere on simulated genes ah they certainly do not fit into any clinical assessments or or laboratory assessments due now
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00231	that said there is a growing understanding that there may be an interferon signal
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00232	in the early pre r a period you you you have opened the door for a discussion here we do not think interferon is a huge player in established rheumatoid arthritis
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00233	but biologically it looked like it might be from older studies including systemic information and actually articular information that interferon might play role you know ah interferon blockade did not work well
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00234	does not mean it is not important in establish disease but ah ah at least the drugs ee had did not work well we think that actually they may play an incredibly important part in this very early phase
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00235	so this is part of that picture i showed where things we know work in established rheumatoid arthritis may actually be different than what we need to use in earlier disease and so
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00236	interferon interferon stimulate disease are are a new target for thinking about in terms of preclinical disease because maybe at that earlier stage these are much more critically important pathways so
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00237	the the concept is there we are trying to now understand exactly what pathways are there to be able to target them effectively
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00239	are there any other questions from anyone
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00241	well doctor deane thank you i apologize our moderator could not make it today but we appreciate your speaking
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00243	thanks thanks for the opportunity and i think everybody has my email from campus if you have any questions to come up later thank you bye bye
