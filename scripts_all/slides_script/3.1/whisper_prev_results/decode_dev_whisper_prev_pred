YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00001	So let me introduce our first speaker who is Sim van der Kloen.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00003	STIEN VAN DER PLOEG IS THE SPECIAL PROJECTS ADVISOR AT WILD ANIMAL INITIATIVE AND ALSO OFFERS COACHING AND CONSULTING THE TWO NEW EFFECTIVE ANIMAL ADVOCACY GROUPS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00005	SO RIGHT NOW I PASS THE MICROPHONE TO YOU, STEAN.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00007	THANK YOU, BIANCA, AND THANK YOU FOR CAREFULLY PRONOUNCING MY NAME. I APPRECIATE IT.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00008	AND MONICA TOO ALSO THANKS FOR HOSTING THIS I'M SURE YOU'RE VERY TIRED ON THIS LAST DAY BUT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AT LEAST EVERYTHING HAS GONE VERY WELL THESE LAST TWO DAYS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00010	YEAH SO I'LL SWITCH NOW TO SHARING MY SCREEN HOPEFULLY I CAN MAKE THAT WORK
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00012	TOGETHER.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00014	Let's see, if you cannot see this, can you signal? Okay, great.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00016	SO YEAH I THINK YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A MANAGER TO LEAD
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00018	AND I WILL TRY TO EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY TODAY.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00020	So hello everyone nice to see a whole bunch of familiar faces here. I appreciate that you're using your Sunday afternoon for some people Sunday very early morning. To be here to learn how you can better protect animals.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00022	I JUST FINISHED A SCI-FI NOVEL ABOUT ANARCHY I AM A PRODUCT OF COLONIALISM I DON'T DEPEND ON MY WORK FOR MONEY AND I HAVE SUCH ISSUES WITH AUTHORITY THAT I WON'T EVEN FOLLOW RECIPE INSTRUCTIONS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00024	THAT IS NOT MY USUAL INTRODUCTION TO WHO STEEN FROM NORDPRUG IS BUT I THINK IT'S HELPFUL FOR YOU TO KNOW WHERE I'M COMING FROM SO YOU FEEL ENCOURAGED TO LISTEN TO ME WITH AN OPEN MIND TO WHY I THINK YOU CAN AND SHOULD LEAD EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT A MANAGER
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00026	I HOPE YOU WILL BE SKEPTICAL NOT JUST OF ME BUT OF ALL LEADERSHIP STRATEGIES YOU LEARN ABOUT. THERE ARE MILLIONS OF BOOKS AND CLASSES AND PODCASTS ABOUT LEADERSHIP.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00027	BUT THE HARD DATA AVAILABLE IS PRETTY LIMITED AND ON TOP OF THAT YOUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE, YOUR CAUSE, THE STRUCTURE OF YOUR ORGANIZATION ALL INFLUENCE WHAT TYPE OF LEADERSHIP WORKS BEST IN YOUR SITUATION AND INDUSTRY.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00029	TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT MY PROFESSIONAL SITUATION I HAVE WORKED AT VARIOUS NONPROFITS OVER 15 YEARS IN FUNDRAISING ADMINISTRATION OPERATIONS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00030	AND I JUST STARTED TO WORK FOR WILD ANIMAL INITIATIVE
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00032	AT WILD ANIMAL INITIATIVE, MY SUPER SMART AND COMPASSIONATE COLLEAGUES AT THIS RESEARCH INSTITUTE WORK TO UNDERSTAND AND IMPROVE THE LIVES OF FREE RANGING SENTIENT ANIMALS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00033	I OFFER PROJECT BASED SUPPORT TO NEW EFFECTIVE ANIMAL ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS AS BIANCA SAID EARLIER. I AM LUCKY ENOUGH TO DO ALL MY WORK FOR FREE WITHOUT TAKING SALARY.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00035	SO THE IDEAS I WILL SHARE WITH YOU TODAY HAVE LARGELY BEEN STOLEN FROM THESE BOOKS AND A BUNCH OF OTHERS AND FROM ARTICLES AND PODCASTS BUT ALSO FROM VARIOUS COURSES AND CLASSES
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00036	AND I WILL SHARE WITH YOU SOME DIRECTLY ABOUT PEOPLE MANAGEMENT, OTHERS ABOUT CRITICAL THINKING, EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVISM, DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION OR NEGOTIATION BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00038	I HAVE LEARNED FROM DOING AND I HAVE LEARNED FROM THESE PEOPLE THESE ARE SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES AT THE VARIOUS CHARITIES I'VE WORKED FOR
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00039	AND YOU CAN MAYBE PICK ME OUT IN ALL OF THESE PICTURES BUT THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT WITH HOW SMALL THE FACES ARE.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00040	BUT YEAH, I'VE LEARNED MORE FROM THESE PEOPLE THAN I HAVE FROM READING AND TRAINING OR FROM READING AND TRAINING COMBINED.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00041	I'VE LEARNED FROM MAKING MISTAKES FROM PEOPLE'S FEEDBACK AND THROUGH OSMOSIS BEING AROUND PEOPLE WHO LEAD AND EXPERIENCING WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOESN'T AND FROM TALKING AND LISTENING TO THESE PEOPLE
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00042	AND FROM TALKING AND LISTENING TO THESE PEOPLE AND FROM TALKING AND LISTENING TO THESE PEOPLE AND FROM TALKING AND LISTENING TO THESE PEOPLE AND FROM TALKING AND LISTENING TO THESE PEOPLE AND FROM TALKING AND LISTENING TO THESE PEOPLE AND FROM TALKING AND LISTENING TO THESE PEOPLE AND FROM TALKING AND LISTENING TO THESE PEOPLE AND FROM TALKING AND LISTENING TO THESE PEOPLE AND FROM TALKING AND LISTENING TO THESE PEOPLE AND FROM TALKING AND LISTENING TO THESE PEOPLE AND FROM TALKING AND LISTENING TO THESE PEOPLE AND FROM TALKING AND LISTENING TO THESE PEOPLE AND FROM TALKING AND LISTENING TO THESE PEOPLE AND FROM TALKING AND LISTENING TO THESE PEOPLE
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00043	AND I LEARN DAILY FROM HIS IDEAS, FROM HIS SUCCESSES AND HIS CHALLENGES AND HE ALSO GIVES ME INSIGHT INTO HOW THINGS ARE DONE IN THE CORPORATE WORLD WHICH I HAVEN'T HAD THAT MUCH EXPOSURE TO.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00045	SO NOW YOU KNOW HOW I LEARNED THE THINGS I'LL SHARE BUT WHAT IS IT EXACTLY THAT I HOPE YOU'LL LEARN?
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00047	WELL, I WILL NOT BLOW YOUR MIND WITH NOVEL IDEAS. I WILL SHARE WHAT I THINK ARE SOME COMMON SENSE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU CAN TRY TO TURN INTO COMMON PRACTICE.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00048	TO ME LEADERSHIP IS ABOUT THE IMPACT YOU CAN HAVE ON OTHERS IRRESPECTIVE OF YOUR AUTHORITY IN THIS TALK I'LL GO OVER FOUR WAYS TO INFLUENCE OTHERS SO YOU CAN DO MORE GOOD TOGETHER
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00049	I'LL EXPLAIN WHY I THINK YOU SHOULD QUESTION IDEAS, PLANS, ASSUMPTIONS AND THE BEHAVIOUR OF YOUR CO-WORKERS INCLUDING YOUR MANAGERS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00051	INSPIRE YOUR COLLEAGUES AND SHOW THEM THE DIFFERENCE THEY MAKE.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00053	. SUPPORT YOUR COWORKERS DEVELOPMENT AND CONNECT WITH YOUR TEAM SO PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY BELONG. THESE FOUR PILLARS WILL STRENGTHEN YOUR LEADERSHIP. I HATE THE WORD STRENGTHEN. I CANNOT PRONOUNCE IT.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00055	AFTERWARDS I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU WHAT YOU THINK AND HEAR ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCES AND ALL THE WAY AT THE END WE SHOULD HAVE TIME TO GO OVER YOUR QUESTIONS IN SLIDO
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00057	SO WHY DO I THINK YOU SHOULD LEAD
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00059	THIS WHOLE PRESENTATION REST ON FOUR ASSUMPTIONS I HAVE ABOUT YOU. I THINK YOU WANT TO HELP MORE ANIMALS. YOU KNOW SOME INTERVENTIONS AND WORK METHODS ARE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN OTHERS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00061	YOU WANT TO FEEL VALUED LIKE YOU MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND LIKE YOU BELONG
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00063	YOU WANT YOUR COWORKERS TO FEEL THE SAME. SO BASED ON THESE ASSUMPTIONS, I BELIEVE IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO TRY TO LEAD YOUR TEAM AND ORGANIZATION IN THE DIRECTION THAT HELPS THE MOST ANIMALS. AND THOSE ANIMALS INCLUDE YOUR COWORKERS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00065	IT IS NOT JUST YOUR MORAL DUTY I THINK TO STAND UP FOR WHAT IS RIGHT WE MUST TRY TO DO THE MOST GOOD WE CAN
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00067	WHEN YOU LEAD YOU WILL PREVENT BURNOUT
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00069	FONALYTICS FOUND PEOPLE LEAVE OR ANIMAL ORGANIZATIONS DUE TO LEADERSHIP AND BURNOUT
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00070	YOUR LEADERSHIP CAN IMPROVE TEAM SPIRIT, CREATE A TRUSTING, OPEN AND SAFE ENVIRONMENT, CONTRIBUTE TO A NON-BLAME CULTURE AND SHOW THE DIFFERENCE YOUR COLLECTIVE WORK IS MAKING.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00072	THIS WILL MAKE IT LESS LIKELY THAT YOU OR THE PEOPLE ON YOUR TEAM WILL SUFFER FROM MENTAL AND PHYSICAL STRESS AND EXHAUSTION.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00074	AND EXHAUSTION AND EXHAUSTION AND YOU WILL HELP MORE ANIMALS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00076	AS YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD JAMIE SAY YESTERDAY, ANIMAL ADVOCACY CAREERS FOUND CEOs AND HIRING PROFESSIONALS IN EFFECTIVE ANIMAL ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS IDENTIFIED LEADERSHIP AS ONE OF THE MOST URGENT SKILL GAPS IN OUR MOVEMENT.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00077	SO YOUR LEADERSHIP WILL MAKE THE MOVEMENT MORE EFFECTIVE YOU CAN HELP FILL THOSE GAPS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00079	PRACTICING LEADERSHIP WILL ALSO LEAD TO PERSONAL GROWTH
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00081	YOU GAIN MORE CONFIDENCE, YOU FEEL MORE IN CONTROL AND YOU STRENGTHEN NOT JUST YOUR PROFESSIONAL BUT ALSO YOUR PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00083	BUT LEADING WHEN YOU'RE NOT IN MANAGEMENT IS NOT ALWAYS EASY SOME PEOPLE MIGHT NOT APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DO HIERARCHICAL ORGANIZATIONS AND MANAGERS STUCK TO THEIR WAYS MIGHT LABEL YOU DIFFICULT
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00085	BUT YOU WILL HAVE TO STAND UP FOR WHAT IS RIGHT YOU MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR HOW YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES ARE TREATED
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00087	AND YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. YOU CAN SAVE MORE ANIMALS AND YOU CAN PROBABLY EXPERIENCE MORE JOY IN YOUR WORK THAN YOU THINK YOU CAN.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00089	SO TO GET TO THE FIRST POINT.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00091	QUESTION IDEAS, PLANS, ASSUMPTIONS AND BEHAVIOR.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00093	IT IS NORMAL IN EACH OF OUR COUNTRIES TO USE ANIMALS AS PRODUCTS, TO SEE THEM AS THINGS, TO KILL AND EAT THEM. YOU GREW UP AND STILL LIVE IN A CULTURE WHERE FEW PEOPLE QUESTIONED THOSE NORMS. BUT YOU DID.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00094	NOT. IT DIDN'T MATTER THAT MOST PEOPLE FOLLOWED THE CUSTOMS OF ANIMAL ABUSE. YOU FELT IT WAS WRONG, DID RESEARCH AND ARE WORKING TO CHANGE THE STATUS QUO.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00096	YOU CAN USE THAT SAME CURIOSITY, HUMILITY AND MORAL COMPASS OF YOURS TO MAKE YOUR ORGANIZATION MORE EFFECTIVE.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00098	AND COMPASS OF YOURS TO MAKE YOUR ORGANIZATION MORE EFFECTIVE AND COMPASS OF YOURS TO MAKE YOUR ORGANIZATION MORE EFFECTIVE AND COMPASS OF YOURS TO MAKE YOUR ORGANIZATION MORE EFFECTIVE AND COMPASS OF YOURS TO MAKE YOUR ORGANIZATION MORE EFFECTIVE AND COMPASS OF YOURS TO MAKE YOUR ORGANIZATION MORE EFFECTIVE AND COMPASS OF YOURS TO MAKE YOUR ORGANIZATION MORE EFFECTIVE AND COMPASS OF YOURS TO MAKE YOUR ORGANIZATION MORE EFFECTIVE AND COMPASS OF YOURS TO MAKE YOUR ORGANIZATION MORE EFFECTIVE AND COMPASS OF YOURS TO MAKE YOUR ORGANIZATION MORE EFFECTIVE AND COMPASS OF YOURS TO MAKE YOUR ORGANIZATION MORE EFFECTIVE AND COMPASS OF YOURS TO MAKE YOUR ORGANIZ
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00100	THE MANAGERS AND EXECUTIVES IN YOUR ORGANIZATION MIGHT ALSO NOT HAVE THE FULL PICTURE OR FULLY GRASP WHAT THE DAY TO DAY WORK ON THE GROUND IS LIKE YOUR PERSPECTIVE IS HELPFUL IN FINDING THE BEST OPTION
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00102	BECAUSE OF YOUR POSITION YOU MIGHT ALSO BE BETTER AT TAKING THE LEAD ON CERTAIN ISSUES AS SOMEONE WITHOUT HIERARCHICAL AUTHORITY YOU ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE BLINDED BY THE POWER YOU HAVE MULTIPLE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00103	THAT POWER AND PRIVILEGE INFLUENCE ONE'S ABILITY TO MAKE EVIDENCE-BASED DECISIONS WITH AN OPEN MIND
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00105	WISDOM ACCORDING TO PLATO AND A BUNCH OF OTHER PEOPLE SINCE THEN IS KNOWING WHAT YOU KNOW AND KNOWING WHAT YOU DON'T.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00107	IT CAN BE HARDER FOR THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE TO KNOW WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW YOU ON THE OTHER HAND MIGHT BE BETTER ABLE TO THINK CRITICALLY HOW AN OPERATION SYSTEM OR A CORPORATE CAMPAIGN COULD WORK
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00109	AND YOU MUST SHARE THAT PERSPECTIVE. SO ASK WHY REPEATEDLY. WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING?
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00111	KNOWING WHY SOMETHING IS IMPORTANT FOR THE MISSION TO SUCCEED AND HOW IT WORKS WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU TO DO IT YOU ASKING QUESTIONS WILL ALSO MAKE IT EASIER FOR OTHERS TO SPEAK UP WHY DOES THIS MEETING LEAD TO SAVE MORE ANIMALS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00112	WHY DOES THIS CAGE FREE STRATEGY LEAD TO LESS SUFFERING WHY ARE THESE PEOPLE ON YOUR GOVERNING BOARD
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00114	WHEN YOU DIG INTO THESE WHY'S YOU CLARIFY THE WORK FOR OTHERS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00116	THEN BE NOISY AND NOISY OR BE CURIOUS AND DIFFICULT.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00118	IF YOU ARE THE SMART AND SILENT TYPE WHO FIXES MISTAKES WITHOUT CONFRONTING THE ERROR MAKERS, YOU ACTUALLY ARE UNDERMINING ORGANIZATIONAL LEARNING.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00119	IF YOU THINK SOMETHING COULD POSSIBLY BE DONE BETTER BUT YOU DON'T SPEAK UP, YOU MIGHT SAY FEWER ANIMALS, SO PLEASE BE NOSEY AND NOISY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00121	AND DON'T FORGET TO QUESTION YOUR OWN IDEAS AND ACTIONS EITHER IS WHAT YOU'RE DOING REALLY THE BEST WAY TO GET RESULTS? HOW DO YOU KNOW? MAYBE ASK THE OPINION OF SOMEONE WHO'S WILLING TO DISAGREE WITH YOU
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00123	THEN INSPIRE
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00125	how show people how the difference, what the difference is that we can make together.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00127	FUNALITICS AGAIN GREAT ORGANIZATION THEY FOUND THAT DISSATISFACTION WITH A TYPE OF ADVOCACY AND NOT FEELING LIKE YOU MAKE A DIFFERENCE ARE BIG REASONS THAT PEOPLE LEAVE ANIMAL ADVOCACY MOVEMENT
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00129	YOU CAN RECONNECT PEOPLE TO THEIR MOTIVATION YOU CAN HELP THEM SEE THE IMPACT THEY HAVE BY INSPIRING PEOPLE YOU LIGHT THEM INTO ACTION TOGETHER WE CAN DO IT
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00131	BILLIONS OF FARMED ANIMALS WILL CONTINUE TO BE MURDERED EVERY YEAR
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00133	WE STILL KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE EXPERIENCES OF ANIMALS IN THE WILD, LET ALONE ABOUT HOW TO SUSTAINABLY REDUCE THEIR SUFFERING. THOSE FACTS ARE BLEAK.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00135	BUT I'M ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT THAT WE ARE BUILDING THE ROADS TOWARDS A FUTURE IN WHICH HUMANITY CARES FOR ANIMALS. THE ACTIONS WE TAKE TODAY CAN SPARE A VAST NUMBER OF ANIMALS A LIFETIME OF SUFFERING JUST YEARS FROM NOW.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00137	SO MANY FISHES, CHICKENS, PIGS, I CANNOT EVEN IMAGINE. THEY'LL HAVE BETTER LIVES.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00139	IT'S DIFFICULT AND MUCH STANDS IN OUR WAY BUT TOGETHER WE CAN BUILD NOT JUST ROADS BUT ROCKETS TO A BETTER FUTURE
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00141	I HOPE YOU REMEMBER THIS AND REMIND EACH OTHER WHEN THINGS GET HARD THAT OUR WORK MAKES A DIFFERENCE FOR REAL INDIVIDUALS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00143	MAKE THE INVISIBLE CLEAR SPREADSHEETS MAKE ANIMALS HAPPIER
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00145	SOMETIMES WE NEED TO DO THINGS THAT SEEM FAR REMOVED FROM PROTECTING ANIMALS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00147	FILLING OUT SPREADSHEETS, RAISING MONEY, CREATING BUDGETS, ADMINISTRATION WE'RE NOT ALL RESCUING FOXES FROM FUR FARMS REMIND YOURSELF AND OTHERS HOW MUNDANE TASKS RELATE TO A BETTER WORLD
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00148	WHEN I COMPARE LAST YEAR'S AVERAGE DONATIONS TO THIS YEAR'S THAT MEANS I WILL HAVE MORE INFORMATION TO RAISE MORE MONEY NEXT TIME
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00149	AND WITH MORE MONEY AT WILD ANIMAL INITIATIVE WE CAN HIRE MORE RESEARCHERS AND LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW WE CAN GIVE ANIMALS THE LIVES THEY PREFER.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00151	BE IMPATIENT FOR A BETTER FUTURE WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND WE MUST MAKE A DIFFERENCE OUR WORK IS NOT JUST IMPORTANT IT IS URGENT
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00152	THE MORE TIME AND ENERGY WE WASTE THE MORE ANIMALS WILL SUFFER THE SMARTER WE WORK THE QUICKER WE WILL FIND WAYS TO HELP ANIMALS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00154	REMIND EACH OTHER OF THIS AND MODEL THAT URGENCY.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00156	CELEBRATE WINDS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00158	Big and small must be celebrated. No, countless hens roaming in a barn without sunlight, laying eggs without ever raising children is not good.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00159	BUT A SWITCH TO THAT FROM TINY CAGES MEANS LESS PAIN, IT MEANS MORE EXPENSIVE EGGS, IT MEANS WE ARE A STEP CLOSER TO LIBERATION. IT'S LIKE WE PASSED A TEST ON THE WAY TO GRADUATION. IT DESERVES A REWARD.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00161	AND WHEN YOU CELEBRATE INDIVIDUAL ACHIEVEMENTS, MAKE IT SPECIFIC. DON'T JUST SAY A PARTNER WORKED DAY AND NIGHT TO CREATE A BEAUTIFUL VEGAN VIDEO.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00163	EXPLAIN WHY THAT IS AN IMPORTANT STEP ON THE WAY TO ANIMAL LIBERATION IF INSTEAD YOU SAY THIS VIDEO SHE WORKED ON SO HARD WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR A MESSAGE TO SPREAD
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00164	FOR PEOPLE TO BE INSPIRED TO EAT BETTER FOOD THANKS TO APARNA'S WORK FEWER ANIMALS WILL BE KILLED FOR FOOD
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00166	THANKS TO A PARTNER'S WORK FEWER ANIMALS WILL BE KILLED FOR FOOD THANKS TO A PARTNER'S WORK FEWER ANIMALS WILL BE KILLED FOR FOOD THANKS TO A PARTNER'S WORK FEWER ANIMALS WILL BE KILLED FOR FOOD THANKS TO A PARTNER'S WORK FEWER ANIMALS WILL BE KILLED FOR FOOD THANKS TO A PARTNER'S WORK FEWER ANIMALS WILL BE KILLED FOR FOOD THANKS TO A PARTNER'S WORK FEWER ANIMALS WILL BE KILLED FOR FOOD THANKS TO A PARTNER'S WORK FEWER ANIMALS WILL BE KILLED FOR FOOD THANKS TO A PARTNER'S WORK FEWER ANIMALS WILL BE KILLED FOR FOOD THANKS TO A PARTNER'S WORK FEWER ANIM
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00168	MAKE SURE YOU FEEL GOOD WHEN YOU DO GOOD. HELP OTHERS FEEL SUCCESSFUL. HELPING OTHERS FEEL SUCCESSFUL WILL LEAD THEM TO CONTINUE TO WANT TO DO THEIR CRITICAL WORK.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00170	VISUALIZE THE PEACEFUL WORLD WE WANT TO LIVE IN AND HOW WE ARE GETTING THERE TOGETHER
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00172	DEVELOP AND GROW OTHER LEADERS. I'M NOT SURE ABOUT YOU, THOUGH I THINK YOU DO TOO. I WANT TO GROW. I WANT TO BECOME A BETTER PERSON THAN I AM TODAY.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00174	I WANT TO GET BETTER AT PROTECTING ANIMALS I CANNOT DO THAT ALONE I NEED TO LEARN FROM THE PEOPLE AROUND ME WHO HAVE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON THE IMPACT I MAKE AND WHO HAVE DIFFERENT KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCES
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00176	A LEADER ACTIVELY TAKES ON THE ROLE OF SUPPORTING PEOPLE TO BECOME THEIR BEST SELVES
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00177	BECAUSE NOT ONLY DOES THAT MEAN YOU GIVE SOMEONE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE BETTER, IT MEANS THE ORGANIZATION WILL BE BETTER AT ACHIEVING ITS GOALS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00179	AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A MANAGER TO DO THIS WE EACH HAVE SOME INSIGHTS OR ABILITIES THAT OTHERS ON OUR TEAMS DO NOT IF YOU SHARE THOSE YOU DEVELOP OTHERS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00181	GIVE FEEDBACK
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00183	BEING EXPLICIT ABOUT HOW MY ACTION LED TO HELPING MORE ANIMALS IS AN INCREDIBLE MOTIVATOR.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00185	GIVING CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK GENUINELY AIMED AT HELPING ME BE BETTER THAT IS SPECIFIC AND TIMELY MAKES ME THINK YOU BELIEVE I HAVE GREATER POTENTIAL
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00187	CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK GENUINELY THAT YOU TRUST ME ENOUGH TO HAVE CHALLENGING CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK GENUINELY CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK GENUINELY CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00188	BUT IGNORING UNPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOR CAN MEAN ROBBING PEOPLE OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO GROW. DENYING PEOPLE A CHANCE TO IMPROVE IN MY OPINION IS SHORTSIGHTED, COWARDOUS AND SELFISH.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00190	INDIVIDUALS WHO BELIEVE THEIR TALENTS CAN BE DEVELOPED THROUGH HARD WORK, GOOD STRATEGIES AND INPUT FROM OTHERS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00192	.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00194	SHARE YOUR KNOWLEDGE I NEED ACCESS TO KNOWLEDGE SO I DON'T WASTE TIME REINVENTING THE WHEEL WHEN YOU SHARE BOOKS, ARTICLES, STRATEGIES AND IDEAS WITH ME I FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE THE EXPECTATION I CAN GROW
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00196	I ADMIT THAT IN THE PAST I MIGHT NOT HAVE ALWAYS SHARED KNOWLEDGE SO THAT I COULD REMAIN THE SOLE EXPERT SO THAT I COULD FEEL NECESSARY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00197	BUT THE FEAR OF BECOMING OBSOLETE IS ONE YOU MUST OVERCOME. LEADERS SHARE KNOWLEDGE. THEY DON'T HIDE IT.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00199	THEY SUCCEED WHEN THEY HELP PEOPLE BECOME BETTER THAN THEY ARE.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00201	MODEL GOOD BEHAVIOR. WHEN I SEE SOMEONE SUCCESSFULLY COACH OTHERS, COMMUNICATE BAD NEWS TRANSPARENTLY AND WITH COMPASSION, OR ASK FOR COMMENTS AND DEAL WITH CRITICAL FEEDBACK WELL, I HAVE EXAMPLES TO COPY FROM.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00203	BE AWARE OF HOW YOUR ATTITUDE AND ACTIONS INFLUENCE OTHERS PERCEPTIONS OF WHAT IS ACCEPTABLE AND GOOD MONKEY SEE MONKEY DO
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00205	SHARE SPACE
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00207	Invite people to participate. It doesn't come natural to everyone to speak up or to step into new situations. But testing new things is important for my growth.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00208	WHEN I AM PUT IN STRETCHED OPPORTUNITIES AND WHEN I AM INVITED TO TAKE UP SPACE, THAT BECOMES EASIER.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00210	TO TAKE UP SPACE THAT BECOMES EASIER TO TAKE UP SPACE THAT BECOMES EASIER TO TAKE UP SPACE THAT BECOMES EASIER TO TAKE UP SPACE THAT BECOMES EASIER TO TAKE UP SPACE THAT BECOMES EASIER TO TAKE UP SPACE THAT BECOMES EASIER TO TAKE UP SPACE THAT BECOMES EASIER TO TAKE UP SPACE THAT BECOMES EASIER TO TAKE UP SPACE THAT BECOMES EASIER TO TAKE UP SPACE THAT BECOMES EASIER TO TAKE UP SPACE THAT BECOMES EASIER TO TAKE UP SPACE THAT BECOMES EASIER TO TAKE UP SPACE THAT BECOMES EASIER TO TAKE UP SPACE THAT BECOMES EASIER TO TAKE UP SPACE THAT BECOMES EASIER TO TAKE UP SPACE THAT BECOMES EASIER
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00211	YOU CAN HELP PEOPLE GET OVER THEIR INSECURITY TO GET OVER THAT THRESHOLD OF SPEAKING UP
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00213	SAYING, HEY, SARAH, DIDN'T YOU HAVE A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE WITH X? WHAT IS YOUR PERSPECTIVE? OR EVAN, I HAVE ONLY HEARD FROM THE USUALS, BUT WHAT ARE THE QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ON THIS TOPIC?
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00215	OUR SUCCESS IS HIGHLY INDEPENDENT ON THAT OF OTHERS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00217	CONNECT CONNECT TO CREATE A SUPPORTIVE COLLECTION A COLLECTIVE SORRY YOUR WORK CAN BE EMOTIONALLY TAXING THE CRUELTY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00219	AND SUFFERING OF ANIMALS SEEMS ENDLESS. OUR ACHIEVEMENTS ARE INCREMENTAL.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00221	WE NEED SUPPORT TO CONTINUE TO DO THIS WORK. MORE OVER, IT IS CRITICAL TO PROVIDE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY WHERE PEOPLE CAN OPENLY TALK ABOUT THE THINGS THAT WENT WRONG AND MIGHT GO WRONG.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00222	IF YOU WEREN'T THERE ON FRIDAY I RECOMMEND YOU WATCH ANIA'S TALK WHO SPOKE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT CREATING PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00224	PEOPLE WON'T SHARE IDEAS IF THEY DO NOT FEEL THEY BELONG.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00226	WITH THEIR FRIENDS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00228	WE ARE LESS LIKE A FAMILY AND MORE LIKE A SPORTS TEAM WITH A COMMON GOAL. FRIEND GROUPS CAN FEEL LIKE CLICKS WITH OUTSIDERS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00230	I THINK WE NEED ALLIES, PEOPLE YOU CAN DEPEND ON TO HELP YOU DO YOUR BEST WORK, WHO YOU HOLD ACCOUNTABLE AND WHO WILL HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE. YOU HAVE THE MOST IMPORTANT CONNECTION WITH YOUR COLLEAGUES. YOU ALL WANT TO HELP ANIMALS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00232	I DON'T WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO ME BECAUSE WE HAVE THE SAME CULTURAL BACKGROUND BUT BECAUSE I HAVE A GOOD IDEA AND I NEED YOU TO BE CRITICAL OF MY SUGGESTIONS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00233	AND YOUR OPINION OF THEM SHOULD NOT BE COLORED BY A MUTUAL LOVE FOR THE MUSIC OF JOY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00235	WE NEED TO TRUST THAT WHEN WE DISAGREE, WE DO SO BECAUSE WE WANT TO GET TO A POINT OF BETTER UNDERSTANDING HOW WE CAN IMPROVE LIVES. WE NEED RELATIONSHIPS WE CAN COUNT ON.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00237	TO FORM A COLLECTIVE, A NETWORK OF ALLIES, BUILD ONE-ON-ONE RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY SUPPORT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN OTHER PEOPLE. MAKE INTRODUCTIONS BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO COULD SUPPORT EACH OTHER OR LEARN FROM EACH OTHER.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00239	CHECK IN PEOPLE DO THEIR BEST WORK WHEN THEY FEEL A SENSE OF BELONGING
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00241	TO CREATE THAT INCLUSION, FOR MANY THAT MEANS THEY NEED PEOPLE TO CHECK IN WITH THEM, ESPECIALLY IN TIMES OF CRISIS. IF YOU ARE A QUEER ADVOCATE IN POLAND RIGHT NOW, YOUR IDENTITY, YOUR EXISTENCE IS BASICALLY THREATENED.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00242	DOING YOUR WORK NOW IS EVEN HARDER THAN NORMAL SHOW EACH OTHER COMPASSION
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00244	BE KIND AND SUPPORTIVE, SEE HOW OTHER PEOPLE ARE DOING AND NOT JUST THE ONES YOU NATURALLY GRAVITATE TOWARDS. REMEMBER THAT YOU HAVE WHAT YOU HAVE IN COMMON AND SHOW UP FOR EACH OTHER.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00246	IN TWO WAYS. FIRST, AMPLIFY VOICES, ESPECIALLY MARGINALIZED ONES. IF SOMEONE ISN'T LISTENED TO BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT INCLUDED OR BECAUSE THEY AREN'T AS LOUD OR AS RESPECTED,
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00247	YOU CAN REPEAT THEIR POINTS AND ATTRIBUTE THEIR IDEAS TO THEM THIS WILL MAKE THEM FEEL HEARD AND PART OF THE TEAM AND BETTER DECISIONS CAN BE MADE
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00249	THEN SPEAK UP FOR EACH OTHER CALL THEM BAD BEHAVIOR WHEN SOMEONE USES DISRESPECTFUL LANGUAGE OR SHOWS THEIR BIAS ASK WHAT THEY MEAN OR EXPLAIN WHY IT CAN FEEL HARMFUL
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00250	IF YOU DON'T, YOU GIVE YOUR SILENT APPROVAL AND ENCOURAGE AN ENVIRONMENT OF HARASSMENT.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00252	YOU CAN HELP CREATE A BRAVE SPACE OF BELONGING WHERE ONLY PEOPLE'S IDEAS ARE JUDGED, NOT THEIR IDENTITY.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00254	WHEN I KNOW YOU HAVE MY BACK, IT WILL BE EASIER FOR ME TO SPEAK UP FOR MYSELF AND FOR OTHERS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00256	IF PEOPLE FEEL THEY ARE HAPPY IN THEIR PLACE OF WORK TURNOVER IS LOW AND MORE PEOPLE WANT TO JOIN YOUR GROUP.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00258	AND YOU DELIVER BETTER WORK AS A COLLECTIVE THAN YOU DO AS A COLLECTION OF INDIVIDUALS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00260	SO ALL THESE FOUR THINGS ARE CONNECTED. EACH OF THE COMPETENCIES SUPPORT AND REINFORCE EACH OTHER.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00262	WITHOUT ASKING QUESTIONS, WITHOUT FULLY UNDERSTANDING WHY OUR METHODS ARE THE BEST AND HOW MONDAIN TASKS RELATE TO THE MISSION, IT IS HARD TO INSPIRE EACH OTHER ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CHANGE THE WORLD.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00263	AND WITHOUT INSPIRATION, WITHOUT BELIEVING YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE, WHAT INTEREST DO I HAVE TO DEVELOP AND GROW?
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00265	AND IF YOU DO NOT DEVELOP, IF YOU HOARD YOUR KNOWLEDGE AND DON'T INVITE PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE, IT WILL BE LESS LIKELY TO FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE A PART, THAT THEY ARE A PART OF A CONNECTED COLLECTIVE.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00267	AND WITHOUT PEOPLE FEELING LIKE THEY ARE CONNECTED AND VALUED, LIKE THEY ARE JUDGED ON THE VALIDITY OF THEIR IDEAS AND NOT THEIR CHARACTER, THEY WON'T FEEL FREE TO QUESTION THE STRATEGY THAT THE ORGANIZATION IS TAKING.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00269	THERE ARE FOUR SKILLS LISTED IN THE CENTER CIRCLE COMMUNICATION, CRITICAL THINKING, FEEDBACK AND DEI STANDS FOR DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00271	LEARNING ABOUT AND PRACTICING THESE CORE SKILLS WILL HELP YOU GET BETTER AT ACTING ON THE FOUR LEADERSHIP COMPETENCIES AROUND IT. EACH OF THESE FOUR SKILLS DESERVE THEIR OWN FULL TASK, IF NOT FULL DAY MULTI-SESSIONS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00272	SO I CAN'T GO OVER ALL OF THEM HERE
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00274	BUT I DO WANT TO GO OVER DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION BRIEFLY BECAUSE I THINK IT'S ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR OUR MOVEMENT NOW. WE MUST CARE ABOUT HUMANS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00276	RESEARCH HAS SHOWN WE WON'T BE AS EFFECTIVE AS ORGANIZATIONS AND AS A MOVEMENT WITHOUT REPRESENTATION ON OUR TEAMS OF THE DIVERSITY OF PEOPLE
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00277	WITHOUT PEOPLE FEELING LIKE THEY BELONG AND WITHOUT EVERYONE BEING EQUALLY LIKELY TO ACHIEVE SUCCESS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00279	SO DIVERSITY TO ME MEANS PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT IDENTITIES AND WAYS OF THINKING ARE REPRESENTED. IN EQUITY, PEOPLE HAVE WHAT THEY NEED TO THRIVE. IN INCLUSION, PEOPLE ARE HEARD AND FEEL LIKE THEY BELONG.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00281	I ALSO BELIEVE THAT IT IS NOT JUST IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN OUR ANIMAL ADVOCACY I THINK IT IS OUR MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO CREATE EQUITY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00282	IF WE ARE APATHETIC TO INJUSTICE AND DON'T STAND UP FOR PEOPLE WHO MIGHT NOT BE IN THE ROOM WE CONSENT TO THE STATUS QUO OF OPPRESSION
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00284	THERE ARE MANY FORMS OF EXCLUSION PLAGUE IN OUR MOVEMENT, SEXISM, ABLEISM, HETERONORMATIVITY, BUT I WANT TO CALL OUT IN PARTICULAR ANTI-BLACKNESS AND THE NEED TO INCORPORATE ANTI-RECISM IN OUR WORK.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00285	I RECOMMEND YOU SEEK OUT ENCOMPASS MOVEMENT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW TO CREATE RACIAL JUSTICE IN THE ANIMAL ADVOCACY SPACE
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00287	I ALSO WANT TO SHOW YOU HOW I THINK DEI THESE THREE CONCEPTS ARE IMPORTANT FOR THE FOUR COMPETENCIES I DISCUSSED
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00289	IMPORTANT FOR THE FOUR COMPETENCIES I DISCUSSED IN THE FOUR COMPETENCIES I DISCUSSED IN THE FOUR COMPETENCIES I DISCUSSED IN THE FOUR COMPETENCIES I DISCUSSED IN THE FOUR COMPETENCIES I DISCUSSED IN THE FOUR COMPETENCIES I DISCUSSED IN THE FOUR COMPETENCIES I DISCUSSED IN THE FOUR COMPETENCIES I DISCUSSED IN THE FOUR COMPETENCIES I DISCUSSED IN THE FOUR COMPETENCIES I DISCUSSED IN THE FOUR COMPETENCIES I DISCUSSED IN THE FOUR COMPETENCIES I DISCUSSED IN THE FOUR COMPETENCIES I DISCUSSED IN THE FOUR COMPETENCIES I DIS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00290	Numerous studies have shown that diversity on your teams can create a work culture that is better at making more informed decisions.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00292	BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE ALL FRIENDS OR LIKE-MINDED PEOPLE, IT IS VERY EASY TO GET ON THE SAME SMOOTH WAVELENGTH AND PRODUCE IDEAS YOU EACH BELIEVE IN.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00294	BUT IT ALSO MEANS YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO MISS OUT ON CERTAIN THOUGHTS. ON THE OTHER HAND, WHEN YOUR TEAM CONSISTS OF PEOPLE WITH VERY DIFFERENT LIFE EXPERIENCE OR DIFFERENT THINKING PATTERNS, DECIDING ON STRATEGY MIGHT FEEL A BIT MORE LIKE A STRUGGLE.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00295	BUT IDEAS ARE CONSIDERED FROM MORE ANGLES
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00297	ENCOURAGING DIVERSITY BOTH COGNITIVE AND IDENTITY-BASED WILL ENCOURAGE MORE QUESTIONS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00299	THAN INSPIRE.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00301	We need to inspire everyone on our teams to deliver our best work. It will be very hard to motivate people that we can fight this massive battle together if some are excluded and feel like they do not belong.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00303	TOGETHER.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00305	People of color and other marginalized persons are often less likely to succeed because they have less access to learning opportunities and mentorship, while at the same time, they are forced to live up to higher standards.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00307	AS A TEAM MEMBER YOU CAN HELP CREATE A SENSE OF INCLUSION AND WITHOUT INCLUSION PEOPLE WILL NOT FEEL FREE TO SHARE THEIR IDEAS NOR WILL PEOPLE BE OPEN TO LISTENING TO YOURS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00308	LEARN TO RECOGNIZE THE WAY BIAS INFLUENCES BEHAVIOR AND HOW IT SEEP INTO ORGANIZATIONAL SYSTEMS SO YOU CAN CHANGE THEM
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00310	QUESTION YOURSELF AND LISTEN TO COWORKERS AND PEOPLE OUTSIDE YOUR COMMUNITY WITH AN OPEN MIND
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00312	THIS WILL HELP YOU INCORPORATE ANTI-OPPRESSION IN YOUR LEADERSHIP.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00314	WITHOUT IT WE ARE LESS EFFECTIVE, WITHOUT IT WE WON'T HAVE JUSTICE. WE ARE ALL ANIMALS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00316	IN SUMMARY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00318	You can make an impact on your coworkers or and your organization and your mission, irrespective of your authority.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00320	QUESTION HOW PEOPLE AND PLANS IN YOUR ORGANIZATION LEAD TO BETTER LIVES FOR ANIMALS ASK CRITICAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DIRECTION OF YOUR ORGANIZATION
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00322	INSPIRE THE PEOPLE YOU WORK WITH, SHOW THEM THE DIFFERENCE YOUR HARD WORK TOGETHER MAKES FOR ANIMALS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00324	DEVELOP OTHERS ABILITY TO MAKE IMPACT SUPPORT THEM IN THEIR GROWTH AND CONNECT BUILD RELATIONSHIPS AND MAKE SURE INDIVIDUALS FEEL LIKE THEY BELONG
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00326	SO
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00328	That is the majority of all I wanted to share with you today. So what's left is some questions I have for you, hoping that we can all learn from each other's experience.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00329	AND I HAVE THREE QUESTIONS FOR YOU AND ONCE WE HAVE GONE THROUGH THEM
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00330	THERE SHOULD BE TIME FOR YOUR SLIDE OUT QUESTIONS. SO WHICH ONE OF MY IDEAS WILL YOU TRY OUT?
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00332	AND I'M GOING TO REMAIN UNCOMFORTABLY QUIET UNTIL SOMEONE SPEAKS UP OR CHATS UP. BIANCA OR MONICA IF YOU'RE STILL HERE, COULD YOU HELP ME READ IF THERE'S ANY CHATS?
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00334	OKAY EVERYONE SO I JUST WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU AS STINE SAID BEFORE TO ANSWER HER QUESTIONS IN THE CHAT OR IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS YOU CAN ASK THROUGH SLIDER
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00336	AND LUKASH SAYS VOICING CONCERNS OR QUESTIONS EVEN MORE ACTIVELY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00338	SOFIA SAYS, REPEATING QUIET PEOPLE'S IDEAS AND ATTRIBUTING THEM TO THAT PERSON.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00340	NOT ONLY CELEBRATE SMALL VICTORIES FOR THE ANIMALS MORE
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00342	SUPPORT OTHER PEOPLE'S GROWTH.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00344	MATTHEW SAYS HE'S GOING TO TRY CELEBRATING SMALL MILESTONES AND GIVING PEOPLE FEEDBACK
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00346	SO UM LET ME SEE WHAT TIME IT IS OKAY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00348	THEN NEXT QUESTION, WHICH ONE OF MY IDEAS WILL BE CHALLENGING FOR YOU OR MAYBE WHAT ARE SOME IDEAS THAT YOU DON'T AGREE WITH
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00350	THAT YOU THINK I SHOULD CHANGE MY MIND ABOUT.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00352	I DON'T SEE ANYONE THAT WOULD WRITE SOMETHING RIGHT NOW IN THE GROUP CHAT. MAYBE IT'S NOT THAT CHALLENGING.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00353	YEAH
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00355	Maybe for example for me, a lot of the most challenging things are, for example, prevent the burnout and
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00357	FOR EXAMPLE PREVENT THE BURNOUT AND FOR EXAMPLE PREVENT THE BURNOUT AND WELL DOING MOST OF THESE THINGS WELL DOING MOST OF THESE THINGS WELL DOING MOST OF THESE THINGS AND ENGAGE EVERY DAY AND ENGAGE EVERY DAY AND ENGAGE EVERY DAY OKAY AND WE HAVE THE FIRST OKAY AND WE HAVE THE FIRST OKAY AND WE HAVE THE FIRST GIVEN MORE FROM NATHALIE GIVEN MORE FROM NATHALIE GIVEN MORE FROM NATHALIE GIVEN MORE FEEDBACK IS CHALLENGING BUT VERY FEEDBACK IS CHALLENGING BUT VERY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00359	FROM NATALLY GIVEN MORE FEEDBACK IS CHALLENGING BUT VERY IMPORTANT THAN FROM THOMAS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00361	I think you can be too annoying. It can slow a process if everyone is critical of everything all the time.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00363	THEN MARIANA
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00365	Exactly. Feedback is definitely the most challenging.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00367	I HAVE TO AGREE WITH THAT. I THINK FOR ME ALSO, BOTH GIVING AND RECEIVING FEEDBACK IS DIFFICULT AND THERE IS A LOT TO LEARN FOR THAT.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00369	THEN LAST QUESTION SOMETHING THAT IN THE QUESTIONNAIRE OR I THINK THE SURVEY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00370	THAT ANIMAL ADVOCACY CAREERS THAT ANIMAL ADVOCACY CAREERS THAT ANIMAL ADVOCACY CAREERS DID, A LOT OF CEOs AND LEADERS DID, A LOT OF CEOs AND LEADERS DID, A LOT OF CEOs AND LEADERS SAID THAT COMMUNICATION IS A SAID THAT COMMUNICATION IS A SAID THAT COMMUNICATION IS A SUPER IMPORTANT MANAGEMENT SKILL SUPER IMPORTANT MANAGEMENT SKILL SUPER IMPORTANT MANAGEMENT SKILL OR A LEADERSHIP SKILL. OR A LEADERSHIP SKILL.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00371	BUT THAT CAN MEAN A MILLION THINGS FROM LIKE BEING GOOD AT SPEAKING EXTERNALLY OR DELIVERING NICE PRESENTATIONS BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO YOU TO COMMUNICATE WELL AS A LEADER?
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00373	OKAY SO AGAIN WE HAVE SOME MORE COMMENTS FROM TANIA GOOD COMMUNICATION ALL COMES DOWN TO LISTENING
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00374	AND THEN FROM ISHIDA I DIDN'T KNOW IF I PRONOUNCED THE NAME RIGHT BUT I HOPE SO NOT JUST HEARING BUT ALSO UNDERSTANDING WHAT SOMEONE HAS TO SAY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00375	THEN FROM MIKA POSITIONING YOURSELF AT THE SAME LEVEL AS OTHERS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00377	NATHALIE HAS A CLEAR PURPOSE BEING ABLE TO EXPLAIN WHY WE ARE DOING CERTAIN THINGS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00379	AND FROM LINA THAT THERE ARE NO MISUNDERSTANDINGS.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00381	I THINK THOSE ARE ALL VERY GREAT POINTS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00382	.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00384	THOSE WERE ALL THE QUESTIONS I HAVE FOR YOU AND BESIDES ALL THE BOOKS I HAVE READ AND THE MANY MORE I STILL WANT TO READ
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00385	AND I THINK MANY OTHERS DO TOO.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00386	AND THESE ARE SOME OTHER SOURCES THAT I HAVE MENTIONED OR THAT YOU CAN FIND ONLINE TO READ MORE ABOUT LEADERSHIP PRACTICES AND ESPECIALLY DON'T FORGET YOUR COWORKERS
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00002	Hi, I'm Pete Sindon, Chief Information Officer at Genomics England, and today I'm here to discuss how research is being used to deliver personalised care.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00004	GENOMICS IS A GROUNDBREAKING AREA OF MEDICINE IT USES A PERSON'S UNIQUE GENETIC CODE TO HELP DIAGNOSE TREAT AND PREVENT ILLNESS
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00005	ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY NOW LETS SCIENTISTS COMPARE GENETIC CODE ACROSS THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TO MAKE NEW DISCOVERIES AND CONTINUALLY IMPROVE HEALTHCARE
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00007	JESSICA IS A FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL SHE HAS A RARE GENETIC CONDITION THAT CAUSES EPILEPSY AND AFFECTS HER MOVEMENT AND GENERAL DEVELOPMENT
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00008	THROUGHOUT THE EARLY YEARS OF HER LIFE SHE HAS BEEN GIVEN MRI'S, LUMBER PUNCTURES, EEG'S TO MEASURE BRAIN WAVES AND MANY OTHER DIAGNOSTICS NONE OF WHICH REVEALED HER PARTICULAR CONDITION
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00010	THROUGH THE 100,000 GENOME PROJECT JESSICA RECEIVED A DIAGNOSIS GENOMICS PINPOINTED A CHANGE TO ONE OF HER GENES THAT WAS NOT PRESENT IN EITHER OF HER PARENTS THEY NOW KNOW THAT JESSICA HAS GLUT1 DEFICIENCY SYNDROME
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00011	SHE DOESN'T PRODUCE ENOUGH OF THE PROTEIN THAT TRANSPORTS GLUCOSE FROM THE BLOOD TO THE FLUID AROUND THE BRAIN
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00013	BUT JESSICA CAN NOW CONTROL HER EPILEPSY BY ADOPTING A SPECIAL KETOGENIC DIET LOWING CARBOHYDRATES AND HIGH IN PROTEIN
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00014	THIS UNDERSTANDING DIRECTLY IMPROVED THE LIFE OF A CHILD AND APPLYING THE PROCESS AT SCALE CAN IMPROVE THE LIVES OF MANY CHILDREN AND ADULTS ALIKE
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00016	FURTHERMORE THE PARENTS NOW KNOW THAT THE CONDITION WAS NOT INHERITED IF THEY DECIDE TO HAVE MORE CHILDREN THEY WILL NOT HAVE THE SAME CONDITION ESSENTIAL FOR THEIR PEACE OF MIND
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00018	RARE DISEASE IS VERY COMMON
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00020	WHILE EACH DISEASE IS INDIVIDUALLY RARE, THERE ARE OVER 7,000 RARE DISEASES.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00022	COLLECTIVELY ONE ONE OF 17 PEOPLE HAS A RARE DISEASE AND THAT REPRESENTS OVER 400 MILLION PEOPLE GLOBALLY
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00024	EIGHTY PERCENT OF RARE DISEASES HAVE A GENETIC CAUSE PATIENTS WILL WAIT ON AVERAGE FOUR YEARS FOR DIAGNOSIS AND NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THEM WILL HAVE NO APPROVED TREATMENT
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00026	THIS IS AN AREA OF MEDICINE WITH A SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL FOR ADVANCING SCIENCE AND IMPROVING LIVES THIS IS WHY RARE DISEASE WAS A MAJOR FOCUS OF THE 100,000 GENOME PROJECT FOR WHICH GENOMICS ENGLAND WAS ORIGINALLY ESTABLISHED
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00028	INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH TO FURTHER UNDERSTAND AND TREAT THESE CONDITIONS IS CRITICAL AND HIGH IMPACT GENOMICS ENGLAND SITS AT THE HEART OF THE UK'S ECOSYSTEM IN ENABLING GENOMIC RESEARCH AND MAKING GENOMICS CLINICALLY ACCESSIBLE
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00029	WE WORK ALONGSIDE FRIENDS IN THE U.K. MEDICAL FAMILY FROM ENERGY ENGLAND TO BIO BANK HDR U.K. AND NIHR
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00030	T E K
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00032	WE HAVE DEEP TECHNICAL AND GENOMIC SPECIALIST PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE LIKES OF AWS, LIFEBIT, ILLUMINA, CONGENICA, NVIDIA AND OXFORD NANOPORE
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00034	WE EXIST IN PART THROUGH CENTRAL GOVERNMENT FUNDING AND IN PART THROUGH RESEARCH FUNDING
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00036	GENOMICS ENGLAND IS A KEY FACILITATOR IN THE TRANSITION TO PERSONALIZED PREDICTIVE AND PREVENTATIVE GENOMIC HEALTHCARE
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00038	WE WORK WITH THE NHS TO DELIVER AND IMPROVE GENOMIC TESTING THAT HELPS DOCTORS DIAGNOSE, TREAT AND PREVENT ILLNESS STARTING WITH CANCER AND RARE DISEASE
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00039	A MINIMUM OF 20,000 WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCES ARE EXPECTED TO BE PROCESSED DURING 2021.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00041	AT THE SAME TIME WE PROVIDE HEALTH DATA AND ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY NEEDED BY RESEARCHERS TO MAKE NEW MEDICAL DISCOVERIES AND DEVELOP MORE EFFECTIVE TARGETED MEDICINES FOR PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00043	TOGETHER THESE TWO HALVES OF THE INFINITY LOOP REINFORCE EACH OTHER ADVANCES IN RESEARCH CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO CLINICAL CARE
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00045	PATIENTS RECEIVING CLINICAL CARE CAN CONSENT TO BE INCLUDED IN RESEARCH DATA TO SUPPORT MEDICAL ADVANCES IN DOING THIS WE CREATE A VIRTUOUS CIRCLE
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00047	THIS SLIDE SHOWS THAT GENOMICS DOESN'T JUST APPLY TO RARE DISEASE THIS SLIDE RELATES TO CANCER
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00049	IN THIS INSTANCE AN INDIVIDUAL PRESENTED WITH A BRAIN TUMOR BUT THE CLINICIAN SUSPECTED THE BRAIN TUMOR WAS NOT THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF THE CANCER AND BY ANALYZING TUMOR MUTATION BURDEN WHICH IS A MEASURE OF THE MUTATIONS IN THE DNA OF THE CANCER CELLS
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00050	IT WAS POSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY THAT THE PRIMARY SOURCE WAS LIKELY CHOLERECTAL LUNG OR MALIGNANT MELANOMA
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00052	BY FURTHER ANALYZING TRANSVERSIONS, A PROCESS WHERE BY C BASES ARE CHANGED TO A BASES IN THE GENOMIC CODE, IT WAS POSSIBLE TO SHOW THAT THE LIKELY CAUSE WAS DNA DAMAGE FROM INHALING BENZOPRENE. BENZOPRENES ARE CARCIGEN PREVALENT IN CIGARETTE SMOKE.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00054	BY USING THESE TWO TECHNIQUES TOGETHER THE PRIMARY DISEASE TYPE WAS IDENTIFIED AS LUNG CANCER AND IN THIS INSTANCE WAS TREATABLE WITH IMMUNOTHERAPY STIMULATING THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO KILL THE CANCER CELLS
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00057	Through the 100,000 Genome Project, over 110,000 genomes have been contributed by approximately 90,000 participants for research purposes.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00058	OVER 70,000 OF THOSE RELATE TO RARE DISEASE FROM THE INDIVIDUALS AFFECTIVE AND IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES FROM THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00059	OVER SEVENTY THOUSAND CANCER PATIENTS HAVE CONTRIBUTED BOTH GERMELINE AND TUMOUR SEQUENCES OVER THE LAST YEAR INDIVIDUALS HAVE ALSO CONTRIBUTED GENOMES TO HELP UNDERSTAND COVID-19 AND THE VARIATION IN SEVERITY OF THE DISEASE
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00060	THIS IS BUILDING TO AN ADDITIONAL 35,000 GENOMES
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00062	THE GENOMIC DATA SITS ALONGSIDE CLINICALLY RELEVANT DATA TO RERIDE A RICH PHENOTYPIC GENOTYPIC ENVIRONMENT FOR DETAILED ANALYSIS
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00063	CLINICAL DATA INCLUDES HOSPITAL EPISODE STATISTICS, MORTALITY DATA, A RANGE OF CANCER SPECIFIC INFORMATION AND EXIT QUESTIONNAIRES FROM CLINICIANS INDICATING FOR EXAMPLE WHETHER SPECIFIC VARIANTS COULD EXPLAIN THE PHENOTYPES
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00065	IN SOME INSTANCES IMAGING AND PRIMARY CARE DATA ARE ALSO LINKED
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00067	TO THE CLASSES OF DISEASE. THIS SLIDE SHOWS THE SPREAD OF GENOMES BETWEEN RARE DISEASE TYPES. THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS RELATING TO NEUROLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT DISORDERS ALONG WITH MANY OTHER CLASSES OF DISEASE.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00069	WHEN LOGGED INTO OUR RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT THESE CAN BE EXPLORED AND SEGMENTED IN MANY WAYS TO FIND THE RIGHT COHORT OF PARTICIPANTS FOR YOUR PARTICULAR STUDY
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00071	AND THIS SLIDE SHOWS THE SPREAD OF PARTICIPANTS BY CANCER TYPE AS EXPECTED YOU SEE GREATER NUMBERS OF THE MORE PREVALENT BREAST, CHOLERECTAL AND LUNG CANCERS CANCER PATIENTS COVER BOTH SOMATIC MUTATIONS THOSE THAT OCCUR FROM DAMAGE TO GENES
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00072	IN AN INDIVIDUAL DURING THE PERSON'S LIFE AND GERMLINE MUTATIONS THOSE THAT ARE PASSED ON DIRECTLY FROM A PARENT TO A CHILD AT THE TIME OF CONCEPTION
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00074	FOLLOWING THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE 100,000 GENOME PROJECT GENOMICS ENGLAND HAS UNDERGONE A TRANSFORMATION FROM PROJECT TO PLATFORM OUR NEXT CHAPTER INVOLVES WORKING WITH PATIENTS, DOCTORS AND SCIENTISTS TO IMPROVE THE GENOMIC TESTING IN THE NHS
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00075	AND HELP RESEARCHERS ACCESS THE HEALTH DATA AND TECHNOLOGY THEY NEED TO MAKE NEW MEDICAL DISCOVERIES AND CREATE MORE EFFECTIVE TARGETED MEDICINES FOR EVERYBODY
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00077	THE MORE GENOMES ARE ANALYZED THE MORE DISCOVERIES CAN BE MADE AND THE BETTER FUTURE CARE WILL BE OUR TRANSITION FROM SELF-MANAGED INFRASTRUCTURE TO AWS CLOUD IS AN ESSENTIAL ENABLER IN SCALING OUR OFFERING TO ENABLE SUCH RESEARCH
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00079	RESEARCHERS CAN ACCESS THE GENOMIC AND CLINICAL DATA OUTLAND ABOVE BY USING GENOMIC ENGLAND'S TRUSTED RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT GEL HAS PARTNERED WITH INNOVATIVE BRITISH DEEP TECH COMPANY LIFEBIT AND IS USING GLOBAL CLOUD PROVIDER AWS TO POWER THE PLATFORM
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00080	PROVIDES ACCESS TO TOOLING REQUIRED TO DEFINE AND EXPLORE A COHORT OF INDIVIDUALS BASED ON GENOMIC OR PHENOTYPIC STRATIFICATION
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00081	THE PLATFORM ENABLES DATA EXPLORATION AND MAKES IT SIMPLE FOR RESEARCHERS TO EXECUTE PIPELINES AND OTHER JOBS
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00083	RESEARCHERS CAN INTRODUCE CUTTING EDGE ANALYTICAL TOOLS OF THEIR CHOICE THROUGH DOCU CONTAINERS LINK THOSE TOOLS SECURELY WITH THEIR OWN DATA
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00084	AND CONDUCT RESEARCH ACROSS ALL DATA SOURCES IN PRIVATE WORKSPACES THAT ARE AUDITED, PROTECTED AND CONTROLLED BY GEL'S STRICT INFORMATION GOVERNANCE POLICIES.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00086	BUT WHY USE A RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT?
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00088	IN ADDITION TO PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY, THERE ARE FOUR KEY REASONS TO USE THE TRUSTED RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT. FIRSTLY, THE DATA SETS INVOLVED ARE ENORMOUS.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00089	THE DATA IS TOO BIG TO MOVE EFFICIENTLY IT CANNOT READILY BE ACHIEVED WITH A SENSIBLE TIME FRAME OR COST AS THE DATA GROWS THIS BECOMES AN EVER-INCREASING CONSTRAINT
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00090	BY WAY OF EXAMPLE WHEN GENOMICS INGDON MOVED ITS OWN DATA FROM ONE STORAGE SYSTEM TO ANOTHER IT TOOK NINE MONTHS FOR THE FULL COPY
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00092	SECONDLY, TECHNOLOGY NOW MAKES IT RELATIVELY SIMPLE TO BRING THE ANALYTICS TO THE DATA INCREASING SPEED AND LURING COST THIS IS BECOMING A COMMON PARADIGM FOR DISTRIBUTED ANALYSIS OF VERY LARGE DATA SETS
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00094	THROUGH LIFEBITS CLOUD OS EACH RESEARCHER RECEIVES THEIR OWN CLEAN ROOM ENVIRONMENT SEPARATE TO ANY OTHER FROM WHICH THEY CAN ACCESS ALL OF THE GENOMICS ENGLAND'S DATA ALONGSIDE THEIR OWN DATA
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00095	THE FULLY MANUFRIED SERVICE PROVIDES MAXIMUM UTILITY WITHOUT SACRIFICING SECURITY OR CONTROL
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00097	THIRDLY INVESTING IN HARDWARE AND ESTABLISHING AN ENVIRONMENT IS A DRAG ON INNOVATION IT'S NOT A GOOD USE OF TIME FOR DATA SCIENTISTS OR BY INFOMATICIANS
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00099	AND LASTLY THE COMMON ENVIRONMENT ENABLES READY COLLABORATION BETWEEN RESEARCH TEAMS WHILE EACH HAS THEIR OWN ENVIRONMENT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO COLLABORATE WHEREVER THEY WISH
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00101	CLOUD BRINGS SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES TO RESEARCH
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00103	YOU CAN BEGIN RAPIDLY WITH NO NEED TO PURCHASE, INSTALL OR MANAGE HARDWARE BY PIGGYBACKING ON AN ESTABLISHED RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT YOU CAN SCALE RESEARCH IMMEDIATELY WITH ALL SECURITY, IDENTITY MANAGEMENT AND DATA INGESTION READY AND WAITING
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00105	FOR A RECESSION OF THE RESEARCH RESEARCH AND THE RESEARCH RESEARCH AND THE RESEARCH RESEARCH AND THE RESEARCH RESEARCH AND THE RESEARCH RESEARCH AND THE RESEARCH RESEARCH AND THE RESEARCH RESEARCH AND THE RESEARCH RESEARCH AND THE RESEARCH RESEARCH AND THE RESEARCH RESEARCH AND THE RESEARCH RESEARCH AND THE RESEARCH RESEARCH AND THE RESEARCH RESEARCH AND THE RESEARCH RESEARCH AND THE RESEARCH RESEARCH AND THE RESEARCH RESEARCH AND THE RESEARCH RESEARCH AND THE RESEARCH RESEARCH AND THE RESEARCH RESEARCH AND THE RESEARCH RESEARCH AND THE RESEARCH RESEARCH AND THE RESEARCH RESE
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00106	A PAY AS YOU GO MODEL MEANS YOU ONLY NEED TO PAY FOR WHAT YOU USE
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00107	FEDERATION OF DATA BECOMES SIMPLER FEDERATION ACROSS ENVIRONMENTS IS A CRITICAL DIRECTION OF TRAVEL AND WE FULLY SUPPORT THE EFFORTS OF THE GFGH COMMUNITY
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00109	THE CLOUD PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT 11 9'S RESILIENCE THIS ALLOWS US TO DIVERT MORE EFFORT INTO ENABLING GENOMIC RESEARCH OVER MANAGING PLATFORM STABILITY
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00111	AND IN A WORLD WHERE GENOMICS IS AT THE BLEEDING EDGE OF HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTE WE CAN ALWAYS BENEFIT FROM THE LATEST AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY WITHOUT BEING CONCERNED WITH CAPITAL INVESTMENT AND DEPRECIATION LIFE CYCLES
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00113	WHILE THE BENEFITS OF CLOUD ARE UNDENIABLE THERE'S A JOURNEY TO SETTING UP A HIGH FUNCTIONING ANALYTICS PLATFORM AT GENOMICS ENGLAND WE'VE MADE THE INVESTMENT SO THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00114	SETTING UP A HIGH FUNCTIONING ANALYTICS PLATFORM GENOMICS ENGLAND WE'VE MADE THE INVESTMENT SO THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00116	HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING IS A SPECIALIZED END OF COMPUTING. WITH THE HELP OF INTEL AND AWS, WE TACKLED THE PERFORMANCE AND CONFIGURATION QUESTIONS HEAD ON.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00118	INTEL SUPPORT ENABLED US TO EMBED ARCHITECTURAL CHANGES FROM WHICH ALL USERS NOW BENEFIT.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00120	WE LOOKED AT SEVERAL CLASSES OF COMMON JOBS. A SIMPLE GWAS, A STANDARD GENOMIC FUNCTION, SAW A FIVE-FOLD IMPROVEMENT IN SPEED AND A TEN-FOLD REDUCTION IN COST.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00122	ON AN OUT OF THE BOX CONFIGURATION A COMPLEX BUT FREQUENT JOB TOOK 25 HOURS TO RUN
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00123	AFTER OUR INVESTMENT WE WERE ABLE TO REDUCE THE COMPUTE TIME FROM TWENTY FIVE HOURS TO TWENTY THREE SECONDS THIS IS A GENERIC IMPROVEMENT FOR ALL SUCH WORKLOADS
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00125	THIS INVESTMENT THAT WE PUT IN ALONGSIDE OUR PARTNERS MATTERS FOR ALL FUTURE RESEARCH AND COSTS OF RESEARCH ARE BASED ON INSTANCE TYPE SELECTED AND COMPUTE TIME USED
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00127	MIGRATING EXISTING SERVICES IS A NON-TRIVIAL MATTER THROUGH OUR CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH AWS MIGRATION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WE'VE PLANNED THE MOVE OF COMPLEX INTERDEPENDENT SERVICES RUNNING OVER NEARLY 1,000 VIRTUAL MACHINES
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00129	OUR FINAL CHALLENGE IS THE FUNDING MODEL WHILE COMMERCIAL ENTITIES SEE THE BENEFIT OF PAY-AS-YOU-GO SERVICES THE ACADEMIC GRANT FUNDING MECHANISM IS LESS READY FOR THE CONCEPT WE'RE LOOKING TO SEE HOW TO BEST MANAGE THAT WITH OUR PARTNERS THROUGH THE OFFERATING MODEL AND POTENTIALLY WITH CENTRALIZED FUNDING
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00131	TO WRAP UP WE'RE NOW AT A POINT WHERE WE'VE PROVEN THE VALUE IN GENOMIC ANALYSIS AND SEEING WHOLE GDM SEQUENCING BEING EMBEDDED IN CLINICAL PATHWAYS
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00132	. THROUGH A YEAR OF COVID GENOMICS HAS ENTERED THE COMMON LANGUAGE. THE NEXT PHASE IS SCALING. WITH MORE DATA WE CAN COLLECTIVELY CONDUCT MORE ANALYSES AND GENERATE NEW PERSONALIZED THERAPEUTICS, DIAGNOSTICS AND PREVENTATIVE TREATMENTS.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00133	THE POTENTIAL GLOBAL IMPACT IS ENORMOUS OUR ENVIRONMENTS ARE ESTABLISHED NOT SO THAT WE CAN CONDUCT RESEARCH BUT SO THAT YOU CAN
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00134	CONDUCT RESEARCH BUT SO THAT YOU CAN CONDUCT RESEARCH BUT SO THAT YOU CAN CONDUCT RESEARCH BUT SO THAT YOU CAN CONDUCT RESEARCH BUT SO THAT YOU CAN CONDUCT RESEARCH BUT SO THAT YOU CAN CONDUCT RESEARCH BUT SO THAT YOU CAN CONDUCT RESEARCH BUT SO THAT YOU CAN CONDUCT RESEARCH BUT SO THAT YOU CAN CONDUCT RESEARCH BUT SO THAT YOU CAN CONDUCT RESEARCH BUT SO THAT YOU CAN CONDUCT RESEARCH BUT SO THAT YOU CAN CONDUCT RESEARCH BUT SO THAT YOU CAN CONDUCT RESEARCH BUT SO THAT YOU CAN CONDUCT RESEARCH BUT SO THAT YOU CAN CONDUCT RESEARCH BUT SO THAT YOU CAN CONDUCT RESEARCH BUT SO THAT YOU CAN CONDUCT RESEARCH BUT SO THAT YOU CAN CONDU
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00135	WE WELCOME COLLABORATIONS WITH ACADEMIA, BIOTECH, PHARMA AND OTHERS INTERESTED IN USING GENOMICS TO TURN SCIENCE INTO HEALTHCARE USING TECHNOLOGY.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00137	THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00002	I'm going to get rid of the meeting controls really quickly too.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00004	ALL RIGHT HI GUYS I'M EMMA
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00005	I'M EMMA LEE
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00006	And we are from Pitt Dance Marathon and today we're going to talk a little bit about implementing effective stewardship for your dance marathon.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00008	SO IN OUR PRESENTATION WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE TWO PRONGED APPROACH THAT WE TAKE AT PDM TO DONOR STEWARDSHIP INCLUDING STEWARDING AS AN ORGANIZATION AND STEWARDING AS FOR INDIVIDUALS
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00009	AND SOME EXAMPLES OF BOTH OF THOSE AND WHAT WE DID IN OUR PROGRAM THIS YEAR AND THEN WAYS THAT OTHER DANCE MARATHONS CAN IMPLEMENT THEM AND THOSE METHODS INTO THEIR PROGRAMS IN THE FUTURE
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00011	SO WE TAKE A TWO PRONGED APPROACH TO
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00013	STEWARDING IN TERMS OF THAT FROM AN INDIVIDUAL POINT OF VIEW AND NOT FROM AN ORGANIZATIONAL STANDPOINT.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00014	SO IN TERMS OF INDIVIDUAL STEWARDSHIP THIS REFERS TO THE RESOURCES AND PLANS THAT ARE IMPLEMENTED FOR PARTICIPANTS AND STAFF MEMBERS TO USE WHERE THEY THEMSELVES ARE ENCOURAGED TO THANK THOSE WHO HAVE DONATED TO THEIR FUNDRAISING EFFORTS
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00015	SO THIS INCLUDES TEMPLATES AND OUTLINES THAT WE PROVIDE TO EVERY INDIVIDUAL INVOLVED IN PDM TO SEND OUT ONCE THEY RECEIVE DONATIONS FROM DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00016	AND THEN ORGANIZATIONAL STEWARDSHIP WHICH REFERS TO THE STEWARDING EFFORTS THAT ARE DONE ON BEHALF OF ALL OF PIT DANCE MARATHONS.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00017	SO THIS INCLUDES EMAILS SENT OUT FROM PDM TO ALL DONORS TO SPECIFIC CATEGORIES OF DONORS, THAT SORT OF THING.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00019	YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING WHY WE DO THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE AND REALLY IT'S BECAUSE IT COVERS THAT ALL OF THE BASES SO SOME PEOPLE DONATE BECAUSE THEY'RE SUPPORTING THE PERSON THAT'S RAISING THE MONEY
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00020	BUT OTHER PEOPLE MAY DONATE BECAUSE THEY REALLY JUST WANT TO SUPPORT THE CAUSE NO MATTER WHO THE FUNDRAISER IS.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00021	SO FOR MONEY DONORS, IT'S A COMBINATION OF THE TWO. SO USING THIS TWO PRONGED APPROACH CHANGES THE FORM OF THANK YOU THAT WILL BE MOST EFFECTIVE FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL DONOR.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00022	SO THOSE THAT DONATED TO SUPPORT THE INDIVIDUAL FUNDRAISER WILL TYPICALLY FEEL MORE TOUCHED AND APPRECIATED WHENEVER THAT PERSON REACHES OUT TO THEM DIRECTLY.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00023	WHETHER IT'S AN EMAIL, A TEXT, THANK YOU CARD, ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00024	BUT THOSE MORE ATTACHED TO THE ENTIRE CAUSE OF DANCE MARATHONS WILL REALLY APPRECIATE THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THEIR CONTRIBUTION FROM THE ENTIRE ORGANIZATION.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00025	AND APPRECIATING THE OVERALL THANK YOU AS WELL AS ANY UPDATES FROM THE ORGANIZATION OR NEW INFORMATION WE CAN PROVIDE THEM FOLLOWING THEIR DONATION.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00026	THIS ALSO HELPS DISBURSE THE RESPONSIBILITY AND THE WORKLOAD OF STEWARDSHIP BECAUSE IT ENCOURAGES INDIVIDUAL STAFF MEMBERS AND PARTICIPANTS TO MAKE THE EFFORTS OF THANKING THEIR DONORS.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00027	SO THAT THE STEWARDSHIP CHAIR OR COMMITTEE OR WHATEVER YOU MAY HAVE AT YOUR DANCE MARATHON ISN'T AS RESPONSIBLE FOR SENDING OUT INDIVIDUAL TEXT MESSAGES OR THANK YOU'S TO EACH SINGLE DONOR.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00028	THIS WOULDN'T BE AS EFFECTIVE ANYWAY BECAUSE WHOEVER IS IN CHARGE OF STEWARDSHIP WON'T KNOW EACH AND EVERY DONOR AS WELL AS EACH FUNDRAISER WILL. SO THIS MAKES IT WAY MORE IMPACTFUL AND PERSONALIZED.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00030	SO FOCUSING ON STEWARDING AS AN ORGANIZATION, ONE OF THE MAIN GOALS AND MAIN ITEMS IN TERMS OF STEWARDING AS AN ORGANIZATION IS THE HIGH LEVEL OF CONSISTENCY IN ORGANIZATIONAL SKILLS.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00031	THAT IT REQUIRES BECAUSE OF THE QUANTITY OF INDIVIDUALS, GROUPS AND COMPANIES TO BE THANKED. SO DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF YOUR DANCE MARATHON, THERE ARE HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF DONORS IN A GIVEN YEAR.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00032	WHICH IS AN EXTREMELY LARGE LIST OF NAMES TO KEEP TRACK OF AND STAY ON TOP OF THANKING SO WE FOUND THAT IT'S SUPER IMPORTANT TO CREATE AND MAINTAIN A ROBUST LIST OF DONORS BY PULLING FREQUENT REPORTS FROM DONOR DRIVE TO KEEP TRACK OF ALL OF THE DONORS
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00033	SO WE TYPICALLY FIND IT MOST USEFUL TO ORGANIZE THESE DONORS INTO DIFFERENT CATEGORIES
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00034	AND CREATE DIFFERENT EXCEL SPREADSHEETS AND THAT SORT OF THINGS BASED ON DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS THOSE WHO HAVE DONATED MULTIPLE TIMES, THOSE WHO HAVE DONATED OVER $100, DIFFERENT KIND OF CHARACTERISTICS LIKE THAT.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00035	AND SO IT'S EXTREMELY HELPFUL IN BREAKING ALL OF THIS DOWN TO KEEP TRACK OF EACH INDIVIDUAL'S DIFFERENT CONTRIBUTIONS AND THEN CREATING THIS ROBUST LIST THAT YOU MAINTAIN AND CAN SOURCE FROM DONOR DRIVE
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00036	AND THEN CREATING THIS ROBUST LIST THAT YOU UH MAINTAIN AND CAN UH SOURCE FROM DONOR DRIVE AND THEN CREATING THIS ROBUST LIST THAT YOU UH MAINTAIN AND CAN UH SOURCE FROM DONOR DRIVE AND THEN CREATING THIS ROBUST LIST THAT YOU UH MAINTAIN AND CAN UH SOURCE FROM DONOR DRIVE AND THEN CREATING THIS ROBUST LIST THAT YOU UH MAINTAIN AND CAN UH SOURCE FROM DONOR DRIVE AND THEN CREATING THIS ROBUST LIST THAT YOU UH MAINTAIN AND CAN UH SOURCE FROM DONOR DRIVE AND THEN CREATING THIS ROBUST LIST THAT YOU UH MAINTAIN AND CAN UH SOURCE FROM DONOR DRIVE AND THEN CREATING THIS ROBUST LIST THAT YOU UH MAINTAIN AND CAN UH SOURCE FROM DONOR DRIVE AND THEN CREATING
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00037	IT IS MORE SPECIFIC IN TERMS OF ACKNOWLEDGING WHO ARE ACKNOWLEDGING EXACTLY WHAT THEY DONATED
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00038	AND GAVE TO THE CAUSE. SO FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU BREAK IT DOWN INTO WHO DONATED $50, WHO DONATED $100, WHO DONATED $200, ET CETERA,
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00039	THIS GIVES YOU SMALLER COHORTS OF DONORS SO YOU CAN PROVIDE THEM INFORMATION ON HOW MUCH THEIR DONATION WILL SUPPORT THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OR CHILDREN'S MIRACLE NETWORK FOR EXAMPLE SO
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00040	YOU CAN INCLUDE MORE PERSONALIZED DETAILS SUCH AS AS A DONOR OF OVER $50 YOU WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE X TO A CHILD AT THE HOSPITAL
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00041	AND THIS IN GENERAL JUST GETS THEM MORE CONNECTED TO THE CAUSE AND ALLOWS THEM TO SEE WHAT TYPE OF IMPACT THEIR DONATIONS ARE HAVING.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00042	AND AGAIN, IT'S JUST A WAY TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT MORE PERSONALIZED WHILE STILL BEING ABLE TO SEND IT OUT TO LARGE COHORTS OF DONORS.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00044	AND WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT IS TO GET CREATIVE THE MORE CREATIVE THAT YOUR ORGANIZATION CAN GET IN WAYS OF THANKING AND STEWARDING DONORS THE MORE EXCITING IT IS FOR THOSE DONORS
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00045	THEY DON'T NECESSARILY JUST WANT AN EMAIL THAT SAYS THANK YOU FOR DONATING TO OUR DANCE MARATHON THEY REALLY LIKE UNIQUE THINGS IT HELPS THEM FEEL MORE APPRECIATED AND MORE RECOGNIZED
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00046	SO PERSONALIZING EMAILS FOR DIFFERENT GROUPS LIKE THIS IS ONE OF THE EASIEST WAYS TO IMPROVE ON THE MAX EMAIL METHOD AS WELL AS SENDING VIRTUAL POST CARDS OR THANK YOU CARDS TO THOSE WHO HAVE DONATED A LOT OF MONEY TO YOU
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00048	WORK WITH YOUR MARKETING TEAM OR WHOEVER MAY BE IN CHARGE OF GRAPHICS ON YOUR TEAM TO CREATE CUTE DESIGNS AND INTERESTING CONCEPTS
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00049	MAYBE THEY TIE INTO YOUR OVERALL BRANDING AS AN ORGANIZATION OR YOUR CAMPAIGN OR IF YOU HAD A THEME FOR YOUR PUSH DAY, ANYTHING LIKE THAT. IT REALLY HELPS TO ELEVATE THE STEWARDSHIP MATERIALS.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00051	SO ONE OF OUR BIGGEST INITIATIVES AT PDM THIS YEAR FOR STEWARDSHIP WAS OUR STEWARDSHIP SPOTLIGHTS DURING OUR DANCE MARATHON
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00052	SO ONCE AN HOUR THERE WAS A SLOT OF A FEW MINUTES SET ASIDE FOR PREPARED STEWARDSHIP SHOUTOUTS WHERE WE WOULD GET ON STAGE AND RECOGNIZE AND APPLAUD SOME OF OUR TOP DONORS
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00053	SO THIS CAME IN THE FORM OF THANKING ALL OF THE BUSINESSES THAT DONATED TO OUR ORGANIZATION IN ANY WAY OVER THE PAST YEAR THANKING AND SHOUTING OUT HIGHEST FUNDRAISERS OF THE HOUR, DAY, YEAR AND SO ON
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00055	SO WE DID THIS TO DEDICATE EXPLICIT TIME DURING ALL OF THE CRAZINESS AND FUN HAPPENING DURING OUR MAIN EVENT TO THANK EVERYBODY WHO MADE A BIG IMPACT ON THE REVEAL AT THE END OF THE DAY
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00057	WE WANTED TO INCORPORATE THESE SPOTLIGHTS AFTER PERFORMERS SO THAT WAY THERE WOULD BE A LARGE CROWD BY THE STAGE SO THAT MORE AND MORE PEOPLE COULD RECOGNIZE OUR DONORS AND THE PEOPLE THAT MADE OUR FUNDRAISING POSSIBLE.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00059	DURING THESE TIMES. WE EVEN CALLED UP CERTAIN PEOPLE TO THE STAGE TO APPLAUD AND THANK THEM IF THEY WERE AT OUR EVENT.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00060	AS WELL AS INVITING REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE BUSINESSES THAT HAD DONATED TO US TO COME TO OUR EVENT SO THEY COULD BE RECOGNIZED ON THE STAGE.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00062	SO NOW SWITCHING OVER TO THE SECOND PRONG OF INDIVIDUAL STEWARDSHIP
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00063	IS ALWAYS A BIT DIFFICULT, WE HAVE FOUND, IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY GETTING PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF STAFF MEMBERS TO USE THE RESOURCES THAT ARE PROVIDED AND
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00064	AND TAKE THE TIME AND EFFORT TO PROPERLY STEWARD, RECOGNIZE AND THANK THEIR DONORS. SO WE FOUND THAT CREATING TEMPLATES AND EMAIL DRAFTS AND TEXT EXAMPLES IS GREAT BUT IF NOT MANY PEOPLE ACTUALLY USE THEM IT KIND OF DEFEATS THE POINT.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00065	SO THIS YEAR ONE OF OUR MAIN GOALS IN TERMS OF STEWARDSHIP FOR OUR DANCE MARATHON WAS TO INCREASE PARTICIPANT STEWARDSHIP SO TRY TO GET AS MANY PARTICIPANTS AS POSSIBLE NOT JUST STAFF MEMBERS TO THANK THOSE
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00066	THAT HAD DONATED TO THEM.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00068	AND SUPPORTED THEM IN MEANINGFUL WAYS. SO THIS INVOLVED NOT ONLY FIGURING OUT HOW TO DISTRIBUTE RESOURCES BUT HOW TO GET PARTICIPANTS TO USE THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAD CREATED AS WELL.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00069	SO THE MAIN IDEA FOR INDIVIDUAL STEWARDSHIP IN TRYING TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL AND THIS EFFORT WAS CREATING AND IMPLEMENTING WHAT WE CALLED A STEWARDSHIP MATRIX
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00070	SO ESSENTIALLY THIS WAS A CHART THAT GAVE A RECOMMENDATION OF WHAT STEWARDING EFFORT OR METHOD THE INDIVIDUAL SHOULD USE TO THANK A DONOR DEPENDENT ON THE AMOUNT THAT THE PERSON DONATED.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00071	SO FOR EXAMPLE, IF A PERSON DONATED OVER $100 WE SUGGESTED AND GAVE THE INDIVIDUAL RESOURCES TO SEND THOSE PEOPLE A VIRTUAL THANK YOU CARD.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00072	SO THE THOUGHT BEHIND THIS WAS REALLY THAT IT WAS A CLEAR IF WE GAVE A CLEAR-CUT SIMPLE GUIDELINE AND METHOD FOR PEOPLE TO FOLLOW IT WOULD PROVIDE A BARE MINIMUM IN A SENSE THAT PEOPLE WOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO FOLLOW
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00073	IT BECAUSE ALMOST ALL OF THE WORK WAS DONE FOR THEM. IF IT WAS LAID OUT
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00074	BASED ON WHO TO SEND WHAT TO BASED ON THEIR AMOUNT OF DONATIONS AND SO OBVIOUSLY IF THEY WANTED TO DO MORE THAN WHAT WE HAD ON THE MATRIX THAT WAS WONDERFUL AND ENCOURAGED BUT THE HOPE WAS THAT INDIVIDUALS WOULD SEE THE PROVIDED
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00075	INSTRUCTIONS AND GUIDANCE AND FOLLOW IT.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00077	SO ON THE NEXT SLIDE IS AN EXAMPLE OF OUR MATRIX. THIS WAS OUR MATRIX DURING A FUNDRAISING PUSH DAY THAT WE HAD IN THE SPRING.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00078	THE MATRIX WAS EASILY MODIFIABLE DEPENDING ON THE EVENT OR SITUATION THAT WE WERE USING IT FOR BUT THIS IS AN EXAMPLE FOR THE SPRING PUSH DAY
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00079	SO AS YOU CAN SEE IT GIVES GUIDANCE ON WHAT STEWARDSHIP METHODS TO TAKE DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH A DONOR DONATED TO THEM
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00080	AND ALONG WITH THIS WE HAD ALL OF THE RESOURCES LINKED IN THE MATRIX SO THAT PEOPLE COULD EASILY GO FIND THE EMAIL AND TEXT AND SEND IT RIGHT AWAY.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00081	OR INSTRUCTIONS FOR VIRTUAL THANK YOU CARDS WITH THE LINK ALL THAT SORT OF THING EVERYTHING EXTREMELY PREPARED
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00082	SO THAT PEOPLE COULD USE THE SIMPLE GUIDELINES AND NOT REQUIRE MUCH EFFORT TO HOPEFULLY INCREASE THEIR PARTICIPATION IN OUR STEWARDSHIP EFFORTS
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00084	IN TERMS OF DISTRIBUTION, LIKE WE MENTIONED, DISTRIBUTING THE INDIVIDUAL STEWARDSHIP MATERIALS IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE PLAN AND FOR THIS WE TEAMED UP WITH THE MARKETING AND RECRUITMENT PANELS OF OUR ORGANIZATION.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00085	SO WHOEVER IS IN CHARGE OF THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PARTICIPANTS OR CREATING THE DIFFERENT GRAPHICS AND MATERIALS THAT YOU PUT OUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA THAT SORT OF THING
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00086	IS WHO WE WOULD RECOMMEND WORKING WITH FOR THIS PART OF THE PLAN.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00087	SO WE HAD OUR RECRUITMENT TEAM SEND OUT THE MATERIALS IN THEIR PARTICIPANT EMAILS WHILE HAVING MARKETING SHARING THE INFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA. SO POSTING THE MATERIALS IN ADVANCE OF THE EVENT.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00088	AS WELL AS DURING THE DAY OF. SO GIVING CONSTANT AND EASY ACCESS TO EVERYTHING A PERSON COULD NEED FOR THANKING THEIR DONORS.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00089	SO WE HAD MARKETING REPOST EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE USING THE METHODS OUTLINED IN THE MATRIX ON THE INSTAGRAM STORY THROUGHOUT THE DAY, WHICH IS A REMINDER FOR PEOPLE TO THANK THEIR DONORS AND AGAIN THE RESOURCES WERE RIGHT THERE ON SOCIAL MEDIA
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00090	OR IN THEIR EMAIL INBOX OR GROUP ME OR WHATEVER METHOD YOU MAY USE
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00091	AND WE KEPT ENCOURAGING THROUGHOUT THE DAY TO REMEMBER TO USE THE PROVIDED MATERIALS THAT WE HAD GIVEN THAT WERE CLEAR CUT AND RIGHT THERE FOR THEM.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00093	SO IN TERMS OF SUCCESS THIS WAS BY NO MEANS A 100 PERCENT SUCCESSFUL EFFORT THERE WERE STILL PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T NECESSARILY TAKE THE INITIATIVE TO THANK THEIR DONORS EVEN WITH
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00094	THIS UH THESE TEMPLATES BUT WE DID SEE A VERY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS THAT WERE STEWARDING THEIR DONORS
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00095	AND WE ALSO RECEIVED AMAZING FEEDBACK FROM PARTICIPANTS THAT THEY USED THE MATRIX BECAUSE IT WAS EASY TO USE AND DIDN'T TAKE A LOT OF TIME OR EFFORT ON THEIR PART.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00096	THEY ALSO COMMENTED THAT THEY REALLY APPRECIATED ALL THE STEWARDING MATERIALS BEING FOUND IN ONE LOCATION SO THAT WAY ALL OF IT WAS EASY TO ACCESS, EASY TO LOCATE AND EASY TO COME BACK TO TO THANK THEIR DONORS NEXT TIME AS WELL.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00098	SO NOW IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTING WHAT WE DID THIS YEAR AT PDM INTO OTHER PROGRAMS NOTHING THAT WE DID IN TERMS OF STEWARDSHIP AT PDM THIS YEAR WAS SUPER SPECIFIC TO OUR PROGRAM
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00099	MEANING IT CAN BE REPLICATED AND UTILIZED AND ADAPTED IN OTHER DANCE MARATHON PROGRAMS. FOR EXAMPLE, WITH THE STEWARDSHIP MATRIX IT CAN BE TAILORED TO WHATEVER YOUR PROGRAM
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00100	NEEDS AND WHATEVER SO LIKE YOU CAN PUT IN YOUR ORGANIZATION'S FAVORITE FORM OF STEWARDSHIP PREVIOUS TEMPLATES THAT YOU'VE CREATED USING AS AN ORGANIZATION TOOL IN THAT WAY
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00101	AND TAILOR IT MORE SPECIFICALLY TO YOUR ORGANIZATION THAT WAY AND IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF DONORS WHO DONATE HIGH AMOUNTS OF MONEY FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN ALTER THE MATRIX TO REFLECT THIS AND MAKING IT GO TO HIGHER LEVELS VERSUS
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00102	ORDERS. OURS DURING PUSH DAYS WHERE WE HAD A GENERAL 249 PLUS CATEGORY. SO IF YOU HAVE LOTS OF DONORS WHO DONATE LARGER AMOUNTS OF MONEY YOU CAN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR HIGHER AMOUNTS OF DONATIONS.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00103	AND THEN IN TERMS OF STEWARDSHIP SPOTLIGHTS THEY'RE ALSO A SUPER EASY BUT EFFECTIVE WAY TO RECOGNIZE THANK AND APPLAUD SOME OF THE HIGHEST DONORS AND THIS CAN BE EASILY DONE DURING ANY OF YOUR DANCE MARATHONS AND YOUR MAIN EVENTS
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00104	JUST SETTING ASIDE A FEW MINUTES AN HOUR OR HOWEVER YOUR ORGANIZATION WANTS TO DO IT IT'S IT'S EASY TO SET ASIDE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING TO SET ASIDE A FEW FIVE MINUTE SEGMENTS THROUGHOUT THE DAY
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00105	FOR SOMEONE TO GET UP ON STAGE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE TOP DONORS IMPORTANT COMPANIES ALL THAT SORT OF THING
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00107	SO JUST IN GENERAL FOCUSING ON STEWARDSHIP AND ORGANIZATION AND ORGANIZATIONAL STEWARDSHIP WILL HELP TO COVER ALL THE BASIS IN THANKING YOUR DONORS BECAUSE IT'S MUCH BETTER FOR THEM TO RECEIVE THANK YOU'S FROM INDIVIDUALS
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00108	AND THE ORGANIZATION RATHER THAN RECEIVE A THANK YOU FROM NO ONE. IT'S BETTER TO THANK THEM AT MULTIPLE POINTS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS COMPARED TO NOT THANKING THEM A SINGLE TIME.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00109	SO THAT WAS KIND OF THE MOTIVATION BEHIND OUR STEWARDSHIP EFFORTS THIS YEAR AND I THINK THAT YOU CAN TAKE A LOT OF THE DIFFERENT METHODS THAT WE UTILIZE
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00110	AND EASILY ADAPT THEM AND ADJUST TO THEM TO FIT THE NEEDS OF YOUR PROGRAM AND YOUR PARTICIPANTS AND YOUR DONORS.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00112	SO JUST TO WRAP IT UP, MAKE SURE THAT YOU GOT THE MAIN POINTS OF OUR PRESENTATION AND WHAT WE HAVE DONE AND WHAT YOU COULD IMPLEMENT, REMEMBER TO FOCUS ON INDIVIDUAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL STEWARDSHIP.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00113	AND GET SO CREATIVE AS CREATIVE AS YOU CAN GET AS MANY PEOPLE FROM YOUR ORGANIZATION INVOLVED TO COME UP WITH WAYS TO STEWARD DONORS AND MAKE THEM FEEL AS APPRECIATED AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE REALLY DO APPRECIATE ALL THAT THEY DO.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00114	AND THEN FOCUS ON STEWARDING ALL DONORS NO MATTER HOW MUCH MONEY THEY DONATE WHETHER YOU'RE CANNING AND THEY PUT 25 CENTS IN
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00115	OR SOMEBODY WHO DONATED A THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE. MAKE SURE THAT ALL DONORS FEEL APPRECIATED BECAUSE EVERYTHING THEY DO MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE FOR OUR ORGANIZATIONS.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00117	YEAH, THAT IS OUR PRESENTATION. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AT ALL, PLEASE FEEL FREE TO REACH OUT TO US. YOU CAN FIND US AT PIT UNDERSCORED PDM ON INSTAGRAM.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00118	OR D M S IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR D M S IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW WE ARE STEWARDING OUR DONORS THIS YEAR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00002	So why Twitter? This is a good question. There are millions of Twitter users.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00004	AND A LOT OF TIMES THEY'LL BE DIFFERENT FROM YOUR FACEBOOK FAN BASE SO YOU COULD BE REACHING NEW POTENTIAL PEOPLE
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00005	AND IT'S KIND OF AN INTERESTING PLATFORM BECAUSE YOU ONLY HAVE 140 CHARACTERS TO TELL YOUR STORY SO YOU HAVE TO BE SHORT, YOU HAVE TO BE BRIEF.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00006	YOU HAVE TO BE BRIEF AND YOU HAVE TO BE BRIEF AND YOU HAVE TO BE BRIEF AND YOU HAVE TO BE BRIEF AND YOU HAVE TO BE BRIEF AND YOU HAVE TO BE BRIEF AND YOU HAVE TO BE BRIEF AND YOU HAVE TO BE BRIEF AND YOU HAVE TO BE BRIEF AND YOU HAVE TO BE BRIEF AND YOU HAVE TO BE BRIEF AND YOU HAVE TO BE BRIEF AND YOU HAVE TO BE BRIEF AND YOU HAVE TO BE BRIEF AND YOU HAVE TO BE BRIEF AND YOU HAVE TO BE BRIEF AND YOU HAVE TO BE BRIEF AND YOU HAVE TO BE BRIEF AND YOU HAVE TO BE BRIEF AND YOU HAVE TO BE BRIEF AND YOU HAVE TO BE BRIEF AND YOU HAVE TO BE BRIEF AND YOU HAVE TO BE BRIEF AND YOU HAVE TO BE BRIEF AND YOU HAVE TO BE BRIEF AND YOU HAVE TO BE BRIEF AND YOU HAVE TO BE BRIEF AND YOU HAVE TO BE BRIEF AND
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00007	AND A LOT OF TIMES WE'LL GET QUESTIONS ON TWITTER LIKE I'M HAVING TROUBLE WITH THE VOLUNTEER DEPARTMENT. WHAT CAN I DO? WELL, I MEAN, WE CAN GIVE THEM THE E-MAIL ADDRESS TO OUR VOLUNTEERS.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00008	AND TRY TO HELP THEM AS BEST WE CAN.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00010	HOW DOES TWITTER WORK? AS I MENTIONED, IT'S UP TO 40 CHARACTERS PER TWEET. THAT INCLUDES ALL PUNCTUATION AND SPACES.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00011	AND IF YOU WANT TO INCLUDE A PICTURE IN YOUR TWEET THAT ALSO TAKES UP ROOM.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00012	SHORT AND SWEET IS KIND OF THE END GAME FOR TWITTER.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00014	TWITTER. SO THE MESSAGES THAT YOU WRITE, WHICH ARE ALSO KNOWN AS TWEETS, ARE PUBLIC. YOU CAN CREATE A PRIVATE PROFILE IF YOU WANT TO DO THAT PERSONALLY.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00015	I WOULD DEFINITELY NOT RECOMMEND THAT FOR AN ORGANIZATION YOU WOULD WANT TO DO SOMETHING PUBLIC
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00017	AND THE OTHER THING THAT'S COOL ABOUT TWITTER IS IT'S SIMILAR TO FACEBOOK AS IN YOU CAN DO IT ON YOUR COMPUTER, YOU CAN BE ON YOUR PHONE AND CHECK UPDATES.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00018	YOU CAN BE ON YOUR IPAD IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE COOL APPS YOU CAN CHECK FROM ANYTHING.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00020	THESE ARE SOME OF THE TWITTER KEY TERMS I'M NOT GOING TO READ THROUGH ALL OF THEM BUT I MAY REFERENCE SOME OF THESE.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00022	THE MAIN THING RETWEET THE RT UM IS SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT'S MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD BE INTERESTED IN DOING UM IS SHARING CONTENT FROM SOMEONE ELSE UM
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00023	SO APA COULD RETWEET A MESSAGE FROM BEST FRIENDS
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00024	MAYBE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAYBE IT'S ONE OF OUR BLOG POSTS THAT'S TALKING ABOUT WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO ADOPT VERSUS
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00025	BUYING. I'M TRYING TO THINK WHAT OUR RECENT BLOG POSTS HAVE BEEN. I CAN'T THINK, VETTY.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00027	OF THE POSTS.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00029	AND THEN I MENTIONED HASHTAGS FOR FACEBOOK. HASHTAGS ARE VERY POPULAR ON TWITTER. SO WHEREVER YOU CAN TRY TO FIT IN THOSE HASHTAGS.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00030	ON TWITTER WE TRY TO USE HASHTAG SAVE THEM ALL A LOT AND WE WILL ALSO MONITOR THAT HASHTAG TO SEE WHO IS USING IT TO SEE IF THERE ARE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE CAN JOIN
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00031	ANY QUESTIONS WE CAN RESPOND TO OR KIND OF KEEP AN EYE ON WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT SAVE THEM ALL BECAUSE THAT'S OUR MOTTO.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00032	YOU CAN ALSO CHECK HASHTAGS LIKE ADOPT OR ADOPT DON'T SHOP
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00033	AND JUST SEE WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT, KIND OF ENGAGE WITH THE GENERAL CONVERSATION, WHICH IS ALWAYS INTERESTING, AND YOU CAN ALWAYS JUMP IN AND RESPOND TO PEOPLE AND ENGAGE THAT WAY.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00035	AND THEN AS I MENTIONED SINCE THERE ARE ONLY 140 CHARACTERS IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO SHORTEN YOUR LINKS
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00036	TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WILL FIT WITHIN A TWEET. WE USE BIT.LY AT BEST FRIENDS.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00037	AND IT'S A FREE TOOL. IT'S VERY COOL. YOU CAN ALSO CUSTOMIZE YOUR LINKS. WE USE BIT LY FOR FACEBOOK AS WELL BECAUSE IT TRACKS HOW MANY PEOPLE CLICK THROUGH.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00039	IT'S VERY USEFUL
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00041	TWITTER IS RELATIVELY EASY TO SIGN UP FOR. YOU JUST FILL OUT A PROFILE AND INCLUDE A PICTURE. GENERALLY THAT'S GOING TO BE YOUR ORGANIZATION'S LOGO.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00042	AND THEY KIND OF HAVE THIS NEW COOL LAYOUT THAT THEY'VE INTRODUCED IN THE PAST YEAR SO IT'S ALMOST LIKE A COVER PHOTO. THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT LOOK MORE LIKE FACEBOOK ESSENTIALLY.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00043	BUT WHEN WE GO THROUGH IT YOU CAN SEE THERE'S LIKE A COVER PHOTO AREA AND THEN A
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00045	YOUR TWITTER ICON AS WELL.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00047	TWEETING TIPS SAME THING AS FACEBOOK AS FAR AS CONTENT PEOPLE LIKE LINKS TO INTERESTING STORIES THEY LIKE BLOG POSTS DEALS
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00048	YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE CHEAKINESS ON TWITTER THAN YOU CAN ON FACEBOOK JUST BE A LITTLE FUNNY THAT'S KIND OF MORE OF THE PLATFORM AND THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ON IT
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00050	UM AND A COOL THING THAT HAS BEEN DOING REALLY WELL ON TWITTER IS IF YOU ACTUALLY JUST
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00051	USE TWITTER.COM, WE USE HOOT SUITE TO MANAGE OUR TWITTER ACCOUNT, BUT IF YOU GO TO TWITTER.COM, YOU CAN UPLOAD A PHOTO WITHIN YOUR TWEET.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00052	AND IT MAKES YOUR TWEET MUCH BIGGER ON THE TWITTER NEWS FEED AND IT JUST LOOKS REALLY COOL. IT'S VERY VISUAL. SO IF YOU HAVE A GOOD PHOTO YOU CAN INCLUDE IN A TWEET.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00053	AND IT WILL TAKE UP CHARACTERS SO
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00054	YOU HAVE TO BE AWARE OF THAT. IF YOU'RE DOING A PHOTO AND A LINK, THEN YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE VERY MANY CHARACTERS TO ACTUALLY
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00056	SWITCH.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00058	So the question is, how valuable is Twitter in managing a smaller group of about 1,000 volunteers? And I would say it's not very valuable.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00059	FOR YOU. I WOULD SAY FOR THE ORGANIZATION OVERALL, IT'S NICE TO HAVE A TWITTER PRESENCE IF YOU HAVE THE TIME AND RESOURCES
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00060	TO MANAGE IT. IF YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT TIME AND RESOURCES I WOULD DEFINITELY SAY THAT FACEBOOK IS NUMBER ONE. IT'S NUMBER ONE FOR US. IT CONTINUES TO BE NUMBER ONE FOR
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00061	MOST ANIMAL WELL FOR ORGANIZATIONS UM INSTAGRAM IS ANOTHER COOL UH
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00063	COOL COOL TOOL THAT PEOPLE ARE USING. UM AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS GROWN IMMENSELY FOR US AS WELL. AND THAT TAKES A LITTLE LESS TIME THAN TWITTER I WOULD SAY. FOR TWITTER TO BE
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00064	VALUABLE AND SUCCESSFUL FOR YOU THERE HAS TO BE TIME SPENT ON IT.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00065	SO TIME SPENT FINDING COOL CONTENT AND SHARING IT, TIME SPENT RESPONDING TO PEOPLE, TIME SPENT TRACKING HASHTAGS AND SEEING WHAT THE CONVERSATIONS ARE.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00066	THERE'S A LOT OF ENGAGEMENT ON TWITTER AND YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF ENGAGEMENT ON FACEBOOK AS WELL AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN HELP MAKE YOUR PAGE A SUCCESS BUT FOR TWITTER THAT'S
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00067	ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE THINGS YOU CAN'T JUST TALK AT PEOPLE YOU TALK TO PEOPLE AND THAT'S WHAT THE TWITTER AUDIENCE EXPECTS IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE PRESENT ON TWITTER.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00069	SO BEST PRACTICES RELATIONSHIP BUILDING IS KEY LISTEN FOR COMMENTS ABOUT YOU RESPOND TO COMMENTS AND QUERIES YOU CAN ALSO DO A SEARCH
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00070	FOR YOUR ORGANIZATION
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00071	AND SEE WHERE ELSE YOU'RE MENTIONED WHERE PEOPLE MIGHT NOT EVEN REALIZE THAT YOU'RE ACTIVE ON TWITTER.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00072	YOU CAN ASK LOTS OF QUESTIONS ON TWITTER UM THAT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE IF THERE'S LIKE A TRENDING
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00073	PICTURE, LIKE THE OTHER DAY IT WAS NATIONAL LOVE YOUR PET DAY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. SO WE POSTED A CUTE PICTURE
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00074	OF A DOG GIVING A KISS TO ONE OF OUR CAREGIVERS AND THEN JUST ASKED UM YOU KNOW IT'S NATIONAL LOVE YOUR PET DAY WITH THE HASHTAG HOW ARE YOU CELEBRATING OR SHOW US HOW YOU'RE CELEBRATING
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00075	SO TWITTER'S A GREAT WAY TO KIND OF BUILD ENGAGEMENT LIKE THAT WHERE IT'S JUST GENERAL QUESTIONS YOU CAN ASK YOUR AUDIENCE AND GET THEM TO RESPOND TO YOU AND
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00076	ENGAGE WITH YOU AND KIND OF UM KIND OF BUILD YOUR BRAND THAT WAY
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00078	UM WE CAN ALSO RETWEET MESSAGES YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE WHICH I MENTIONED AND I CAN SHOW YOU HOW TO DO THAT WHEN WE GET TO THE LIVE DRIVE
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00080	AND THE OTHER THING ABOUT TWITTER IS THAT IT'S VERY REAL TIME. PEOPLE WILL RESPOND QUICKLY AND THEY WILL EXPECT YOU TO RESPOND QUICKLY.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00081	YOU KNOW 24 HOURS OR LESS IS KIND OF OUR GO-TO ON TWITTER UM
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00082	WE TRY TO BE VERY QUICK. WE PRETTY MUCH TRY TO RESPOND TO ANYONE WHO TWEETS US WITHIN AN HOUR ON WEEKDAYS DURING BUSINESS HOURS.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00083	YOU KNOW AFTER HOURS ARE ONE THING AND WEEKENDS ARE ANOTHER THING AND WE DO MONITOR AND RESPOND ON WEEKENDS AS WELL
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00084	BUT THERE IS DEFINITELY AN EXPECTATION THAT IF YOU ARE ACTIVE ON TWITTER THEN YOU SHOULD BE ACTIVE AND YOU SHOULD BE RESPONSIVE.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00086	OKAY THE QUESTION IS WHY IS AN AVERAGE PERSON ON TWITTER? THE ANSWER IS BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THEMSELVES.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00088	YEAH IT'S NARCISSISM YOU KNOW TWITTER IS A MICROBLOG ESSENTIALLY
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00089	SO GIVES YOU 140 CHARACTERS TO SAY WHAT YOU ATE FOR BREAKFAST OR SAY THAT YOU JUST WORKED OUT. OH PEOPLE LOVE TO SHARE THEIR WORKOUTS.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00091	OR CROSSFITTERS ESPECIALLY LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THEIR WORKOUTS.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00092	THEY LIKE TO SHARE PHOTOS AGAIN YOU KNOW SAME THING WITH INSTAGRAM IT'S JUST SHARING PHOTOS PEOPLE LIKE TO SHARE
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00094	WHAT THEY WANT ABOUT THEIR LIVES WITH OTHERS AND THEY WANT TO GET FEEDBACK AND THEY WANT TO FEEL VALIDATION SO YEAH.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00096	YEAH UM SO THE QUESTION IS WOULD TWITTER BE A VALUABLE RECRUITING TOOL UM
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00097	IF YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND VOLUNTEERS AND I WOULD SAY IT DEFINITELY COULD BE UM IF YOU CAN TAKE THE TIME TO MONITOR CONVERSATIONS UM AND INSERT YOURSELF
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00098	IN THEM WHEREVER YOU CAN YOU KNOW RESPOND TO PEOPLE THAT ARE IN YOUR AREA TALKING ABOUT WORKING OUT YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE A COOL PROGRAM LIKE THE JOG A DOG PROGRAM HERE IN AUSTIN IS AWESOME
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00099	IF YOU HAVE A PROGRAM LIKE THAT AND YOU HAVE A PRESENCE ON TWITTER AND YOU CAN REACH OUT TO PEOPLE YOU CAN ABSOLUTELY USE IT THAT WAY
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00101	PEOPLE REALLY LIKE UM
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00102	THE ACTIVITY AND THAT KIND OF YOU KNOW THE CONSTANT FEEDBACK I THINK THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE LOOK FOR ON TWITTER IS YOU KNOW THAT IMMEDIATE GRATIFICATION AND A RESPONSE RIGHT THERE UM
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00104	YEAH THE QUESTION IS WHEN WE LAUNCHED OUR INSTAGRAM UM DID WE SEE A DECREASE ON TWITTER LIKE WAS THERE ANY CANNIBALISM AND I WOULD SAY THERE ISN'T UM INSTAGRAM OVERALL HAS A VERY YOUNG AUDIENCE
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00106	WHICH IS KIND OF COOL BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU'RE REACHING NEW PEOPLE UM AND INSTAGRAM IS A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN POST A LITTLE BIT
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00108	DIFFERENT CONTENT MORE YOU KNOW BUT BEHIND THE SCENES FUNNY PHOTOS WITH FUNNY CAPTIONS
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00109	ALLOWS FOR A LITTLE BIT MORE CREATIVITY JUST BECAUSE IT'S THE NATURE OF THAT CHANNEL. AND THEN YOU CAN ALSO AGAIN UTILIZE HASHTAGS ON INSTAGRAM TO GET YOUR PHOTOS SEEN BY MORE PEOPLE.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00111	NO WE DIDN'T SEE ANY DROP YEAH YEAH OUR TWITTER CONTINUES TO GROW UM
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00113	AND WE DON'T REALLY DO ADVERTISING ON TWITTER WE'VE DONE IT A COUPLE TIMES BUT UM I CAN'T THINK OF YOU KNOW MORE THAN A HANDFUL OF TIMES THAT WE'VE
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00115	HAVE DONE ACTUAL PAID ADVERTISING ON TWITTER. HERE I'M GOING TO ACTUALLY PULL UP THE TWITTER
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00117	SO THIS IS OUR BEST FRIENDS TWITTER ACCOUNT
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00119	SO THIS IS THAT COVER PHOTO THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT. THIS IS THE ICON.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00121	THIS IS THAT COVER PHOTO THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT UM THIS IS THAT COVER PHOTO THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT UM THIS IS THAT COVER PHOTO THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT UM THIS IS THAT COVER PHOTO THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT UM THIS IS THAT COVER PHOTO THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT UM THIS IS THAT COVER PHOTO THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT UM THIS IS THAT COVER PHOTO THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT UM THIS IS THAT COVER PHOTO THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT UM THIS IS THAT COVER PHOTO THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT UM THIS IS THAT COVER PHOTO THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT UM THIS IS THAT COVER PHOTO THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT UM THIS IS THAT COVER PHOTO THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT UM THIS IS THAT COVER PHOTO THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT UM THIS IS THAT COVER PHOTO THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT UM
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00122	FOR IMAGES ON FACEBOOK LIKE THE IDEAL IMAGE SIZE TO POST ON FACEBOOK IS LIKE 1200 BY 1000 PIXELS SPROUT SOCIAL
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00123	MEDIA IMAGE GUIDELINE AND IF YOU GOOGLE IT IT'LL COME UP AND IT'S ACTUALLY IN UM A GOOGLE SPREADSHEET
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00124	SO IT'S CONSTANTLY UPDATED BUT IT TELLS YOU EXACTLY WHAT IMAGE SIZES YOU NEED WHICH IS REALLY GREAT. IT TELLS YOU YOUR FACEBOOK COVER PHOTO, FACEBOOK EVENTS,
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00125	FACEBOOK TIMELINE FACEBOOK ADVERTISING TWITTER INSTAGRAM INSTAGRAM IS LIKE 2048 BY 2048
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00126	I THINK BUT TWITTER THE IDEAL SIZE IS LONGER IT'S LIKE EIGHT HUNDRED BY FOUR HUNDRED OR SOMETHING SO
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00127	THERE ARE A LOT OF VARYING IMAGE SIZES AND IF YOU CAN GET YOU KNOW THE IDEAL IMAGE SIZE FOR WHATEVER YOU'RE POSTING IT'S GONNA
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00129	SHOW OFF THE BEST THAT'S DEFINITELY
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00131	OKAY YEAH ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00133	SO THIS IS OUR TWITTER ACCOUNT
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00135	THESE ARE OUR TWEETS
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00136	YOU CAN ON TWITTER PIN TO THE TOP OF YOUR PROFILE PAGE THE SAME WAY THAT YOU CAN ON YOUR FACEBOOK PAGE.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00137	THAT'S A NEWER FEATURE THAT THEY ROLLED OUT WHEN THEY DID THIS KIND OF NEW LAYOUT AGAIN YOU KNOW TWITTER TRYING TO BE MORE LIKE FACEBOOK
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00139	YOU CAN SEE SO LIKE THIS TWEET HERE HAD 20 RETWEETS THAT'S WHAT THIS LITTLE THESE LITTLE ARROWS ARE AND THIS FAVORITE HERE AND 14 FAVORITE
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00141	AND THIS FAVORITE HERE AND THIS FAVORITE IS
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00143	This is something that we retweeted.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00145	THIS IS THE NATIONAL LOVE YOUR PET DAY AND THIS DID REALLY WELL. 129 PEOPLE FAVORED IT, WHICH FOR TWITTER IS KIND OF A LOT FOR US.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00147	AND YOU CAN SEE I SHOWED YOU THIS POST ON OUR FACEBOOK PAGE AS WELL AND THE IMAGES ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SIZES SO THIS IS OPTIMIZED FOR TWITTER VERSUS THE ONE THAT WAS OPTIMIZED FOR FACEBOOK
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00149	AND AS YOU CAN SEE
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00151	ON THE FEED, IT SHOWS UP AND LOOKS REALLY NICE. SO THIS IS A LOT MORE LIKELY TO CATCH YOUR EYE THAN JUST THIS.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00153	SO WE TRY TO DO THAT WHENEVER WE CAN.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00155	DO THAT. YOU CAN ALSO SEE WHO YOU'RE FOLLOWING, FOLLOWERS. ONE THING COOL ABOUT FOLLOWERS IS IT SHOWS YOU VERIFIED FOLLOWERS AS WELL AND VERIFIED
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00156	ACCOUNTS ARE NORMALLY ORGANIZATIONS OR CELEBRITIES OR BRANDS WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FOLLOWERS.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00157	SO THESE ARE JUST SOME OF OURS I DON'T NONE OF THESE ARE FAMOUS TO ME E-ONLINE THERE WE GO
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00159	SO THIS IS OUR HOME
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00161	PAGE FOR TWITTER.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00163	SO THIS IS THE TIMELINE OF
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00165	THESE ARE ALL PEOPLE THAT WE FOLLOW RIGHT HERE. SO THAT'S WHAT'S SHOWING UP IN OUR FEED.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00167	AND AS YOU CAN SEE
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00169	I MEAN PEOPLE ARE SUPER, SUPER ACTIVE ON TWITTER. THERE'S A LOT TO KEEP UP WITH. YOU COULD DEFINITELY POST A LOT MORE OFTEN ON TWITTER THAN YOU CAN ON FACEBOOK JUST BECAUSE THE LIFE SPAN OF A TWEET
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00170	IS MUCH MUCH SHORTER THAN THE LIFESPAN OF A FACEBOOK POST SO YOU HAVE A LOT MORE LEEWAY TO POST
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00171	I MEAN WE TRY TO GET OUT FIVE TO SEVEN TWEETS A DAY UM VERSUS TWO FACEBOOK POSTS A DAY
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00172	AND THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE TWEETS THAT WE HAVE RESPONDING TO PEOPLE AND MONITORING HASHTAGS.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00174	AND YOU CAN SET THAT UP. I WOULD NOT ADVISE SETTING THAT UP.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00176	OH HELLO
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00178	I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND LINKING YOUR FACEBOOK TO YOUR TWITTER BECAUSE THEY ARE SUCH DIFFERENT PLATFORMS.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00179	THAT IF YOU DO A FACEBOOK POST AND LINK IT TO TWITTER IT'S GOING TO GET CUT OFF IT'S GOING TO BE SHORTENED AND PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO CLICK THROUGH TO FACEBOOK TO LOOK AT IT YOU WANT TO POST CONTENT THAT IS
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00180	CRAFTED FOR TWITTER. CRAFTED FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE WHOLE THING AT ONCE.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00182	SO THIS IS VERY COOL. THIS SHOWS ALL THE RETWEETS, PEOPLE THAT FOLLOW US, MENTIONS,
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00184	DEALING WITH TROLLS
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00186	and able to, yeah. And like, we can take a look at the hashtag, AMP at 2015, and see, look at all these people that are talking about it.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00188	WHICH IS VERY COOL
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00190	AND SO I'M SURE YOU'RE FOLLOWING THE HASHTAG AND THEN RESPONDING TO THESE PEOPLE. SO GREAT WAY TO ENGAGE. EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY TAGGING AMERICAN PETS ALIVE ON TWITTER, THEY'RE USING THE HASHTAG.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00191	SO YOU CAN STILL RESPOND WITH THEM AND KIND OF CREATE A CONVERSATION AND LET THEM KNOW YOU'RE PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT THEY'RE SAYING
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00193	AND THE OTHER THING THAT'S COOL ABOUT USING THIS, YOU CAN DO VERIFIED USERS. SO AGAIN, THOSE ARE LIKE THE
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00002	So next up we have Dr. Wenzong Zhao. He leads the Harvard ME-CFS collaboration with Dr. Ron Tompkins.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00003	HE IS AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR IN SURGERY AND BIOFOREMATICS AT HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL AND MGH
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00004	HE'S A MEMBER OF THE SCIENTIFIC ADVISORY BOARD AT OMF HE DIRECTS THE MGH INFLAMMATION AND METABOLISM COMPUTATIONAL CENTER AND HE ALSO LEADS THE COMPUTATIONAL GENOMICS GROUP AT STANFORD
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00005	AS WELL. SO HE'S A VERY BUSY MAN. HE'S GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE OPEN DATA SHARING PLATFORM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, WENZEL.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00007	THANK YOU VERY MUCH WENZHONG THANK YOU VERY MUCH WENZHONG THANK YOU VERY MUCH WENZHONG THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR COMING UM WE'RE THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR COMING UM WE'RE THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR COMING UM WE'RE A LITTLE BIT A SHORT OF TIME SO A LITTLE BIT A SHORT OF TIME SO A LITTLE BIT A SHORT OF TIME SO I'LL TRY TO GO THROUGH THE SLIDES I'LL TRY TO GO THROUGH THE SLIDES I'LL TRY TO GO THROUGH THE SLIDES QUICKLY AND WE CAN END BY 3 45 QUICKLY AND WE CAN END BY 3 45 QUICKLY AND WE CAN END BY 3 45 TO BE ON SCHEDULE
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00009	FOR THE NEXT TEN TO FIFTEEN MINUTES I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT UH WHAT DATA AVAILABLE UM ON THE WEBSITE OF UH OPEN MEDICINE FOUNDATION AND UH UH WHAT WE ARE
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00010	WORKING WITH COLLABORATORS AND PRACTICALLY EVERYONE UM IN THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY TO LOOK AT THIS DATA AND UH UH WHAT HAS BEEN DONE AND WHAT'S IN THE WORKS
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00011	SO AS WE HAVE HEARD UM QUITE A FEW TALKS THIS AFTERNOON ABOUT THE SCIENCE UH BEHIND CFS AND WE KNOW THAT AS A COMPLEX DISEASE
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00012	THERE ARE MANY POTENTIAL REASONS AS CAUSES OF ME CFS FROM GENES TO INFECTIONS TO THE ENVIRONMENT SO IN ORDER TO
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00014	FIND THE POTENTIAL CAUSES OF C F S AND PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY FIND THE TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS. WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00015	AT THE CAUSES OF C F S AND UH PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY FIND THE TREATMENT OF PATIENT WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO LOOK EVERYWHERE FOR THE CLUES AND AS RON AND HAVE TO LOOK EVERYWHERE FOR THE CLUES AND AS RON AND HAVE TO LOOK EVERYWHERE FOR THE CLUES AND AS RON AND OTHER EXPERTS ALREADY MENTIONED EVERYWHERE FOR THE CLUES AND AS RON AND OTHER EXPERTS ALREADY MENTIONED EVERYWHERE FOR THE CLUES AND AS RON AND OTHER EXPERTS ALREADY MENTIONED BECAUSE OF THE LITTLE FUNDING OTHER EXPERTS ALREADY MENTIONED BECAUSE OF THE LITTLE FUNDING OTHER EXPERTS ALREADY MENTIONED BECAUSE OF THE LITTLE FUNDING AVAILABLE TO ME CFS
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00016	UNFORTUNATELY MOST OF THE STUDIES TODAY ONLY CAN LOOK AT ONE OR TWO ASPECTS OF ALL THE THINGS AMONG ALL THE THINGS AND ON A SMALL
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00017	GROUP OF PATIENTS. THEREFORE, THE FINDINGS FROM EACH INDIVIDUAL STUDIES NEED TO BE COMPARED SO YOU CAN FIND A RIGOROUS SIGNAL.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00018	AND DATA COLLECTED FROM DIFFERENT LEVELS, FOR EXAMPLE, MEASURING GENES VERSUS MEASURING INFECTIONS NEED TO BE INTEGRATED
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00019	SO WE CAN FIND SOMETHING CALLED A CHAIN OF EVIDENCE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD US TO THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE. SO WE HAVE HEARD ENOUGH OF THIS AND BECAUSE OF THIS
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00021	EVIDENCE THAT WE HAVE SEEN THAT EARLY ON OPEN MEDICINE FOUNDATION UNDER LEADERSHIP OF DR. RON DAVIS ADOPTED THIS POLICY OF
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00023	WHICH MEANS THAT UH AS SOON PRETTY MUCH AS SOON AS A EXPERIMENT IS DONE UH WE TRY TO PUT DATA ON THE INTERNET
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00024	AND SHARE WITH RESEARCHERS IN THE COMMUNITY BASICALLY ALL OVER THE WORLD
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00025	AND WHOEVER REGISTERED ON THIS WEBSITE CAN SEE THE RAW DATA AND THE TYPE OF FINDINGS THAT HAVE BEEN
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00027	BY OUR OWN TEAM AND OFTEN THEY WOULD YOU KNOW TELL US WHAT ARE THE FINDINGS THAT WE PERHAPS ARE MISSING OR THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION OF THE RESULTS
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00028	SO I THINK THAT'S UH VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF THE TIME I WOULD ONLY BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU SORT OF A COUPLE OF GLIMPSE UH OF WHAT'S ON THE WEBSITE
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00030	SO THIS IS THE SORT OF THE FRONT END OF THE WEBSITE IT'S MECFS.STANFORD.EDU AT THE MOMENT WE'LL HAVE ANOTHER MIRROR SITE ON THE HAVARD DOMAIN SOON
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00031	SO THE AS YOU CAN SEE HERE EACH STUDY IS SEPARATED UH INTO DIFFERENT LEVELS BASED ON THE TYPE OF THE STUDY EITHER THE CLINICAL INFORMATION OF THE PATIENT
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00032	OR THE CLINICAL TEST OF THE PATIENT OR THE DIFFERENT TYPE OF MOLECULAR MEASUREMENT GENES, PROTEINS, METABOLITES, MICROBIOME, ET CETERA.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00033	SO THE DATA ARE SEPARATED INTO DIFFERENT LEVELS AND THEN UM WE WOULD COMPARE THE PATIENTS AS A GROUP WITH THE CONTROLS AND THAT RESULTS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE ON THE WEBSITE FOR PEOPLE TO STUDY
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00034	AND PERHAPS MORE INTERESTINGLY WE WOULD LIKE TO INTEGRATE DATA FROM DIFFERENT LEVELS TOGETHER
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00035	SO IF YOU HAVE A GENE THAT APPEARS TO BE ABNORMAL IN ONE PATIENT YOU WOULD WANT TO SEE WHETHER THE PROTEIN THAT'S COATED BY THIS GENE IS ALSO AFFECTED.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00036	AND WHETHER THE FUNCTION OF THAT PROTEIN IS INDEED IMPERED IN THE PATIENT.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00037	SO JUST AS AN EXAMPLE. OBVIOUSLY THIS TAKES A LOT OF PEOPLE'S WORK AND THAT'S A LIST OF
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00038	PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTED TO THIS WEBSITE. SO THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00040	THAT PARTICULAR PATIENT AND THIS IS A PARTICULAR TEST THAT ONE CAN CHOOSE AND THAT'S THE PARTICULAR THREADSHOT OF FILTERING
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00041	SO YOU CAN CHOOSE WHAT YOU WANT TO SEE AND THIS SHOWS THE RESULTS. THIS HAPPENED TO BE A CYTOKINE DATA OF ONE PARTICULAR PATIENT
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00042	AND HE OR SHE HAD TWO ABNORMAL TESTS IN TERMS OF THEIR IN TERMS OF THE PATIENT'S CYTOKINE LEVELS SO THESE ARE THE PATIENT GROUPS THESE ARE THE CONTROL GROUPS
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00043	AND THIS TRIANGLE INDICATES THE LEVEL OF THE PATIENT SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS PARTICULAR PATIENT HAS MUCH LOWER
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00044	LEVEL OF THE CYTOCINE WHICH IS CALLED THE BRAIN-DERIVED NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR WHICH IS INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF NEUROLOGICAL DISEASES AS A BIOMATERACTORY FOR SOME OF THOSE DISEASES.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00045	SO THIS PATIENT HAS A REALLY LOW LEVEL NOT ONLY COMPARING TO THE CONTROLS
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00046	BUT ALSO COMPARING TO OTHER PATIENTS SO THAT'S POTENTIALLY VALUE THAT WE WANT TO GATHER FROM THIS TYPE OF PLATFORM AND SIMILARLY UM THE OTHER ONE WHICH IS CD40L UH MARINE UH
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00047	TALKED ABOUT UH THE FUNCTIONS OF T CELLS C D FORTY L IS ONE OF THOSE UH CYTOKINES THAT UH THAT UH WOULD AFFECT
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00048	UH T CELL FUNCTIONS FOR EXAMPLE AND HERE YOU SEE THAT BETWEEN PATIENT BETWEEN PATIENT GROUPS AND CONTROL GROUP THERE'S ACTUALLY NO DIFFERENCE HOWEVER THE LEVEL OF THIS PARTICULAR PATIENT
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00049	FOR THIS PARTICULAR CYTOCORN IS MUCH LOWER SO I HOPE THAT WHILE WE GROW ENOUGH NUMBER OF THIS KIND OF OBSERVATIONS PEOPLE CAN START TO LINK THINGS TOGETHER
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00051	AND THIS IS JUST OUR CURRENT ATTEMPT OF DOING SO.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00053	EACH ROW HERE IS ONE PHENOTYPE FOR EXAMPLE SLEEP PROBLEMS, COGNITIVE TEST PROBLEMS, PAIN, FATIGUE, ET CETERA OBVIOUSLY WE MEASURE A LOT OF THOSE
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00054	AND EACH ROLE HERE IS THE UH CORRELATION OF ONE OF THE UH ANALYTES AT DIFFERENT LEVELS
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00055	THAT'S SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH ANY OF THESE SYMPTOMS OF PATIENTS. SO THE REDISH COLOR SHOWS POSITIVE CORRELATION FOR EXAMPLE CAUTIS LEVEL.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00056	AND THE BLUISH COLOR SHOWS UM NEGATIVE CORRELATION AND AS WE HEARD FROM THE CLINICIANS UM EARLY ON UH SINCE THERE'S YOU KNOW A A RATHER LARGE HETEROGENETY AMONG DIFFERENT PATIENTS
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00057	UM THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE WANT TO DO THIS TYPE OF ANALYSIS TO SEE WHAT ARE THE UH INDICATORS THAT WOULD BE MOST CORRELATED WITH A PARTICULAR TYPE OF UH UH UH SYMPTOM OF THE PATIENTS
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00059	SO THIS IS THE GROUPS OF PHYSICAL FUNCTIONS, COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS AND SLEEP PROBLEMS.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00061	AND SO THESE ARE GENE RESULTS AS RON MENTIONED. WE TRY TO SEQUENCE THE WHOLE GENOME OF PATIENTS AS MUCH AS WE CAN.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00062	AND ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF THAT RON ALREADY MENTIONED ONE OF THE FINDINGS
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00063	BUT YEAH THE OTHER WAY OF LOOKING AT THE DATA WOULD BE THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY FIND THOSE RARE PATHOGENIC VARIANTS UH IN EACH PATIENT YOU KNOW REALISTICALLY FOR MOST OF US WE HAVE YOU KNOW
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00064	PATHOGENIC VARIANTS ONE OR THE OTHER THE QUESTION MORE IS THAT WHETHER THOSE VARIANTS CONTRIBUTE OR POTENTIALLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE DISEASE SO JUST AS AN EXAMPLE HERE'S
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00066	CFTR WHICH IS THE WHICH IS CYSTIC FIBROSIS
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00068	GENE AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE ARE TWO HETOXYGUS VARIANTS THERE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THIS IS ONE OF THOSE VARIANTS THAT'S COMMON IN THE COCASIAN POPULATION.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00069	UH BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WE SEE ACTUALLY A LOT OF THESE VARIANTS THAT ARE KNOWN TO BE INVOLVED IN UH
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00070	POTENTIALLY NEUROLOGICAL DISEASES. SO BECAUSE OF TIME I'LL JUST SHOW YOU A ROUGH COMPARISON. SO WHAT THIS IS IS TO ASK THE QUESTION,
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00071	IF YOU UH LOOK AT THE PATHWAYS OF THOSE VARIANTS I SHOWED YOU UH IN THE PREVIOUS SLIDE AND ASK
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00073	WHAT HAVE BEEN DONE ON THESE VARIANTS IN THE STUDY OF OTHER DISEASES FOR EXAMPLE IN PAIN UH IN SLEEP DISTURBANCE IN COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT AND TO OUR SURPRISE
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00074	AS YOU CAN SEE HERE MORE THAN 50% OF THE VARIANTS THAT I SHOWED YOU ARE ACTUALLY KNOWN TO BE INVOLVED IN ALL THOSE SYMPTOMS
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00075	SO SINCE WE ONLY LOOK AT A FEW PATIENTS AS RANG MENTIONED THESE WERE SEVERELY ILL PATIENTS IN THIS PARTICULAR STUDY WE THOUGHT THAT WE SHOULD
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00076	YOU KNOW TEST WHETHER IT'S AN ACCIDENTAL FINDINGS WE USED UK BIOBANK DATA THERE THEY HAVE SOMEWHERE AROUND TWO THREE THOUSAND
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00077	C F S PATIENTS AND YOU CAN SEE THAT UH IF WE TAKE THEIR DATA
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00079	WE WOULD GET A WEAKER BUT STILL SIGNIFICANT SIGNAL THERE. SO THIS JUST GIVE YOU SOME CLUE OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00080	AND UM YOU KNOW TRYING TO SEE WHETHER UH WE CAN USE THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00081	TO IDENTIFY THE POTENTIAL CAUSE OF THE DISEASE AS WELL AS TRYING TO BORROW STRENGTH
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00082	FROM STUDIES OF OTHER DISEASES THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL FOR TREATING ME CFS PATIENTS UM ONE DAY. NOW BECAUSE OF THE TIME
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00084	I'LL PROBABLY JUST STOP HERE
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00002	Good morning everyone. Good morning. I'm going to move away from here. It's absolutely lovely to see you all this morning. And I thought what I would do is just say a few words of welcome and thank you.
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00003	UM I WANT TO ESPECIALLY START OFF BY THANKING SCANDIT WHO ARE OUR DRINK SPONSORS LAST NIGHT
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00004	BECAUSE IT WAS FANTASTIC TO SEE AT THE END OF WHAT WAS A LONG AND FULL DAY OF CONTENT TO SEE SO MUCH NETWORKING AND FRIENDSHIPS GOING ON BOTH IN THE ROOM, OUTSIDE AND ELSEWHERE.
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00005	AND I ALSO WANT TO AND IMPORTANTLY SAY AS WE ENTER OUR SECOND DAY OF THIS CONFERENCE THANK YOU AGAIN TO ALL OUR SUPPORTERS AND TO OUR PARTNERS AND EXHIBITORS
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00006	AND ESPECIALLY OUR PLATINUM SPONSOR INGENICA AND ALSO TO OUR NON-COMMERCIAL SPONSORS AS WELL
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00008	I ALSO AT THIS STAGE I'VE ALSO LIKE TO THANK OUR FRIENDS FROM
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00010	UM OUR FRIENDS FROM UM OUR FRIENDS FROM THE AV COMPANY QUADRANT IT IS FABULOUS THE AV COMPANY QUADRANT IT IS FABULOUS THE AV COMPANY QUADRANT IT IS FABULOUS WE WORK WITH THEM FOR FOUR OR FIVE WE WORK WITH THEM FOR FOUR OR FIVE WE WORK WITH THEM FOR FOUR OR FIVE CONFERENCES NOW
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00011	AND WHATEVER ELSE IS GOING ON WHATEVER PANIC'S GOING ON ABOUT COVID TESTS AND PEOPLE NOT COMING YOU CAN RELY ENTIRELY ON THE FACT THAT THE VIDEO IS GOING TO WORK THE GRAPHICS ARE WORK AND THE MICROPHONES
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00014	I just have to do that. I have to do that. I'm sorry. And I know I do it every year, but I have to do it. So thank you. I'm just going to spend a couple of minutes telling you about what's going to happen today.
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00015	AND THE FIRST OF WHICH IS THAT UH I'M GOING TO INTRODUCE OUR CHAIR FOR THE DAY IN A FEW MINUTES AND THAT'S PROFESSOR SIR TERENCE STEPHENSON WHO'S CHAIR OF THE HEALTH RESEARCH AUTHORITY
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00016	AND HE'S GOING TO NAVIGATE OUR WAY THROUGH THIS MORNING SESSION AND THAT MORNING THIS MORNING SESSION STARTS AS STRONG AS YESTERDAY
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00017	WHERE WE HAVE UM RICHARD MURRAY THE CHIEF EXEC OF THE KINGS FUND TO TAKE US IN OUR HELICOPTER UP TO 60 000 FEET UM KEITH KINRADI SAYING HELICOPTERS WON'T GO TO 60 000 FEET THEY'LL CRASH DOWN BUT HE'LL PROBABLY TELL ME THAT LATER
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00018	AND THEN WE'RE DELIGHTED TO HAVE PROFESSOR ANDREW GODDARD BOD TO COME AND GIVE HIS VIEW OF THE FRONT LINE UM
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00020	THEN WE'VE GOT KATHY KONRADI, WHO IS THE CHIEF INVESTIGATING OFFICER OF THE HEALTH CARE SAFETY INVESTIGATION BRANCH, OR H-SIB.
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00021	AS IT'S KNOWN MAYBE MAY TELL US WHY IT'S HC BUT NOT HSIB BUT WHO KNOWS
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00023	THEN WE CHANGE
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00025	THE ATTACK EVER SO SLIGHTLY. BECAUSE YESTERDAY ON THIS STAGE WAS VERY ENGLAND FOCUS. BUT AS ANNE SAID WHEN SHE WELCOMED US YESTERDAY, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT GS1 UK HAS DONE OVER THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00026	IS ACTUALLY HAVE A FOCUS ON THE U K BIT
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00027	AND THERE ARE DELIGHTFULLY NATIONAL PROGRAMS NOW IN SCOTLAND AND WALES AND NORTHERN IRELAND AND WE'RE DELIGHTED TO HAVE COLLEAGUES FROM SCOTLAND AND WALES TO JOIN US TODAY AND TALK THROUGH THAT.
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00028	WE HAVE STEVE BUSH ON STAGE LATER TO TALK ABOUT HIS UH MEDICAL DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS AT LEADS AND AS YOU KNOW LEADS WAS ONE OF THE
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00030	FOUR FOREFRONT AND WAS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE SCAN FOR SAFETY PROGRAM AND HE'S GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW LEEDS ARE MOVING ON FROM THAT AND WHAT ELSE THEY'RE UP TO UM THEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE OUR BREAK
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00031	AND THEN WE'LL COME BACK AND TALK ABOUT DATA AND ONE THIS WHOLE THING ABOUT IF YOU'RE SCANNING THINGS SCANNING IS GOOD BUT IF YOU GET DATA
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00032	ALL YOU'RE GETTING IS ONE SCAN IS ONE BEEP MILLIONS OF SCANS GIVES YOU INSIGHT AND HOW WE'RE ABLE TO USE THAT INSIGHT BUILDING ON SOME OF THE SOME OF THE SORT OF CONVERSATIONS WE HAD YESTERDAY
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00033	AND THEN FINALLY ON THIS STAGE FOR THE MORNING BEFORE LUNCH OUR CHIEF EXEC AND GODFREY WILL COME AND GIVE A SUMMARY OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER THE FIRST DAY AND A HALF
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00034	YEAR. WE'RE THEN GOING TO MAKE THE BREAKOUT STAGES. THERE WAS SUCH HUGE CONTENT YESTERDAY ON THE BREAKOUT STAGES. SO HERE YOU HEAR THE BIG PICTURE AND THEN WE GO INTO DETAIL AND IMPLEMENTATION AND PROCESS ON THOSE STAGES.
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00035	AND WHERE WE HAVE THIS AFTERNOON AFTER AN EARLY LUNCH WE HAVE ON THE DHL STAGE THE SCAN FOR SAFETY AND THE FUTURE THE NATIONAL SCAN FOR SAFETY PROGRAMS HAVE MORE DETAIL AND MORE DATA FROM WALES AND SCOTLAND
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00037	AND THE NATIONAL SCAN FOR SAFETY AND THE FUTURE THE NATIONAL SCAN FOR SAFETY AND THE FUTURE THE NATIONAL SCAN FOR SAFETY AND THE FUTURE THE NATIONAL SCAN FOR SAFETY AND THE FUTURE THE NATIONAL SCAN FOR SAFETY AND THE FUTURE THE NATIONAL SCAN FOR SAFETY AND THE FUTURE THE NATIONAL SCAN FOR SAFETY AND THE FUTURE THE NATIONAL SCAN FOR SAFETY AND THE FUTURE THE NATIONAL SCAN FOR SAFETY AND THE FUTURE THE NATIONAL SCAN FOR SAFETY AND THE FUTURE THE NATIONAL SCAN FOR SAFETY AND THE FUTURE THE NATIONAL SCAN FOR SAFETY AND THE FUTURE THE NATIONAL SCAN FOR SAFETY AND THE FUTURE THE NATIONAL SCAN FOR SAFETY AND THE FUT
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00038	AND WE'VE GOT SOME REALLY INTERESTING UM PRESENTATIONS ON THAT STAGE UH LED BY UH DAVID LAWSON WHO IS FROM GUYS AND TOMMY'S
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00039	AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE SEEN MOST OVER THE LAST PROBABLY 18 MONTHS AT GS1 UK IS THE MOVE TO USING GS1 STANDARDS IN A
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00040	VERY STRONG WAY FOR ASSET MANAGEMENT, AND THAT'S ABSOLUTELY BEEN SOMETHING THAT'S A COVID A COVID THING. SO WE'VE GOT A ON THE ON THE SCANDIC STAGE. WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT.
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00042	SO LAST THING FROM ME BEFORE TERRANCE STEPS UP
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00044	IS TO REMIND YOU OF OUR CHARITY, TO REMIND YOU THAT WE WILL BE SENDING OUT FEEDBACK FORMS FOR YOU TO FILL IN AND FOR EACH FEEDBACK FORM WE RECEIVE, AS I MENTIONED YESTERDAY,
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00045	AT GS1 UK WILL DONATE FIVE POUNDS TO THE DEC FOR SUPPORTING HUMANITARIAN RELIEF IN UKRAINE AND WE HAVE THAT LOVELY QR CODE THAT YOU CAN JUST SNAP AND MAKE A DIRECT DONATION TOO
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00046	SO THAT'S IT FROM ME. ENJOY ASK QUESTIONS. LET'S HAVE THAT REAL INTERACTIVE PARTICIPATIVE EVENT THAT WE HAD YESTERDAY AGAIN.
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00047	AND WITHOUT FURTHER ADO I'D LIKE TO INVITE PROFESSOR TERRANCE STEVENSON TO COME AND CHAIR THIS MORNING'S SESSION TERRANCE THANK YOU
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00002	So who here is an addict?
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00004	ALL RIGHT I LOVE YOU ALREADY SO UM
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00006	THIS IS A DREAM I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY THIS IS AMAZING SO MY MOM STARTED HER RECOVERY ABOUT 30 YEARS AGO SHE'S WHY I'M HERE SO YOU'LL HEAR HER A BIT AS WE GO THROUGH THIS TALK SO WHO'S HERE TO RELAPSE PREVENTION
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00008	WHO THINKS THAT SOUNDS AWFUL I JUST IT'S JUST COLD YOU KNOW AND SO WE WANTED TO BRING LIFE TO RECOVERY LIKE WHO WANTS TO RECOVER IF IT'S NOT FUN
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00009	YOU KNOW AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE DO WE BRING THIS LIKE BRIGHT LIGHT TO RECOVERY AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT OUR GOAL IS SO WE CAME UP WITH RECOVERY PROTECTION AND IT'S A DIFFERENT APPROACH AND I THINK IT GIVES PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENJOY
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00010	PREVENTING A RELAPSE RIGHT BECAUSE IF IT'S NOT FUN ARE WE GOING TO DO IT WHY DID WE DO DRUGS RIGHT BECAUSE THEY CHANGED THE WAY WE THOUGHT AND WE FELT
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00011	THAT'S WHY I DID THEM ACTUALLY ERIC CLAPTON WAS INTERVIEWED IN 60 MINUTES AND THE GUY INTERVIEWING SAID SO HEROIN WAS YOUR FIRST DRUG AND HE SAYS NO IT WAS SUGAR I WAS FIVE YEARS OLD
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00012	BREAD AND BUTTER WITH SUGAR AND WAFERS AND RUSSELL BRAND TALKS ABOUT THE CHOCOLATE WAFERS WHEN HE WAS A KID IN HIS BOOK RECOVERY IT'S THIS IS A DRUG AND WE NEED TO TREAT IT LIKE A DRUG
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00013	SO I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU THROUGH A STACKABLE THREE TOOL SYSTEM AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO DO SOME WORK TOGETHER SO YOU'LL FIND CARDS STACK OF CARDS IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR DESK
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00014	IF YOU CAN'T FIND KAREN SHE'S GOT HER HANDS UP SHE'S GOT SOME EXTRAS OVER THERE AND WE'RE GONNA BE DOING SOMETHING TOGETHER SO WE'RE GONNA DO SOME WORK
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00015	BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S THE WORK IS WHAT GIVES US THE FREEDOM SO THE FIRST THING WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT IS A TRIGGER-FREE TRIANGLE SO WE CAME UP WITH THIS TO HELP PEOPLE FIRST IDENTIFY THE FOODS THAT ARE TRIGGERED FOR THEM BUT IT ACTUALLY CAN GO MUCH DEEPER THAN THAT SO WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT DEBATE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00016	WHO'S EVER HAD WHO'S BEEN ON AN AISLE IN A GROCERY STORE AND EVER DEBATED
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00018	THEIR HANDS? COME ON, WHERE ARE THE HANDS? THERE THEY ARE, ALL RIGHT. WHO'S BEEN ON AN AISLE IN THE GROCERY STORE?
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00019	I IN YOUR DRUG FOOD WONDERING SHOULD I OR SHOULDN'T I RIGHT AND WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT ROMANCE THAT LONGING THAT LUST RENDEZ-VOUS HAVE YOU EVER EATEN FOOD AND HITTING THEM IN THE TRASH
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00020	OR JUST IT'S LIKE A LUSTFUL THING RIGHT AND THE GUILT THAT FOLLOWS THE DRUG RIGHT HOW LONG DOES THE PLEASURE REALLY LAST
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00021	IF YOU'RE A LATE STAGE ADDICT LIKE ME NOT LONG AND THEN YOU'RE RIGHT INTO THE GUILT SO BASICALLY
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00023	WHAT WE CAN DO IS WE CAN USE THESE THINGS TO IDENTIFY THE THINGS THAT ARE DANGEROUS FOR US SO IF SHOULD I EAT IT SHOULD I NOT EAT IT THAT DEADLY QUESTION RIGHT SO I HATE TO BREAK IT TO YOU THE ANSWER IS NO
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00025	YOU SHOULDN'T EAT IT RIGHT AND THE ROMANTIC THE PLANNING I WENT TO NASHVILLE LIKE FIVE YEARS AGO AND EVERY SINGLE ITEM ON MY ITINERARY WAS ABOUT FOOD
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00026	EVERY PLACE I WENT WAS ABOUT FOOD BECAUSE I'M AN ADDICT THAT'S WHAT I DO SO IT BECOMES THIS INGRAINED IN HOW WE THINK AND HOW WE LIVE AND THE GUILT
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00027	DOES IT MAKE YOU FEEL ASHAMED DOES IT MAKE YOU FEEL WORTHLESS OR LIKE A FAILURE IF IT DOES IT'S A DRUG
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00028	SO BASICALLY DEBATE IS PLAYING WITH MATCHES ROMANCE IS SEEING HOW CLOSE YOU CAN GET TO THE FLAMES AND GUILT IS GETTING BURNED WHO'S BEEN BURNED BEFORE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00029	IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BURN YOU FOLKS IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE WE FORGET THOUGH AND WE FORGET AND THAT'S WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT TO GO THROUGH
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00030	SO JUST HERE REALLY QUICK DEBATE ASKING YOURSELF SHOULD I SHOULDN'T I ROMANCE THE PLANNING IN ADVANCE THE RENDEZ-VOUS
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00032	AND GUILT THAT WORTHLESS SENSE OF FAILURE AFTER WE'VE DONE IT SO THAT'S THE FIRST TOOL THAT'S THE TRIGGER FREE TRIANGLE OKAY
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00034	THE THREE P'S AND THIS IS A THIS GOES DOWN TO MY MOM AND NOW MY GRANDMOTHER WAS DYING SHE WAS ON HER DEATH BED SHE WAS ON PALATE OF CARE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00036	AND I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND MY MOM'S GETTING READY TO GO SO WE CAN WATCH HER PASS
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00038	AND SHE GETS A COOLER.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00040	COUPLE ICE PACKS. SHE STARTS WEIGHING AND MEASURING HER VEGETABLES AND HER MEATS. I'M LIKE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00042	SHE SAYS I'M PROTECTING MY RECOVERY
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00044	WOW THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES GUYS SO WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS IT GOING TO BE FOR YOU TO PROTECT YOUR RECOVERY YOU DON'T NEED TO PROTECT MY RECOVERY I DO YOU NEED TO PROTECT YOUR RECOVERY SO IT COMES WITH THE PLANNING
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00045	PREPARING AND PROTECTING WE'RE GONNA WALK THROUGH THESE THREE THINGS SO YOU REALLY UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF IT OKAY IF YOU FAIL TO PLAN YOU ARE PLANNING TO FAIL
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00046	IF YOU DON'T DO THE STEPS THAT YOU NEED TO DO TO GET TO WHERE YOU WANNA BE YOU CAN'T GET THERE IT'S THAT SIMPLE YOU DON'T GO ON A ROAD TRIP WITHOUT PUTTING GAS IN YOUR CAR DO YOU
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00047	DO IT THE SAME WAY YOU'RE GONNA GET AN OIL CHANGE YOU'RE GONNA MAKE SURE YOUR WIPERS ARE CLEAR RIGHT YOU'RE GONNA GET READY FOR YOUR TRIP AND YOU'RE GONNA PREPARE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00048	YOU'RE GONNA PACK UP YOUR CAR YOU'RE GONNA PUT IN YOUR SUITCASE YOU'RE GONNA REMEMBER YOUR TOILETRY YOU'RE GONNA DO ALL THESE THINGS AND THAT'S GONNA PROTECT YOUR EXPERIENCE ON YOUR TRIP IT'S GONNA MAKE SURE THAT WHEN YOU GET THERE YOU HAVE WHAT YOU NEED TO DO WHAT YOU WANNA DO
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00049	WHICH IS HOPEFULLY TO HAVE A GOOD TIME SO
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00051	TO PREPARE IS TO MAKE READY OR ABLE TO DEAL WITH OR DO SOMETHING RIGHT IT'S THE STEPS THAT WE NEED TO TAKE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT BECOMES POSSIBLE FOR US TO ENGAGE IN THE ACTIVITIES THAT WILL ENSURE THAT WE PROTECT YOUR RECOVERY
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00053	I FEEL LIKE THERE'S ONE MISSING HERE SO I MISSED PLAN PLANNING IS VERY IMPORTANT YOU CAN'T PREPARE WITHOUT A PLAN IT'S LIKE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE HEARD JORDAN PETERSON TALK ABOUT THE STUPID PLAN WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF THIS STUFF IN THE VILLAGE THAT I RUN RIGHT
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00054	A STUPID PLAN IS YOU FIGURE OUT WHERE YOU WANT TO GO AND THEN YOU SIT FOR FIVE MINUTES AND YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE THE STEPS THAT YOU NEED TO DO TO GET THERE YOU DON'T NEED TO BE RIGHT
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00055	YOU JUST NEED TO DO WHAT YOU SAID YOU'RE GONNA DO AND THEN YOU FAIL SPECIFICALLY YOU'LL SUCCEED SPECIFICALLY AND YOU'LL ADJUST YOUR PLAN SO THE PLAN ISN'T SET IN STONE IT'S THE BEST IDEA THAT YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW AND THEN YOU ENGAGE IN THAT PLAN
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00057	AND THAT GOES TO THE PREPARATION WHICH WE JUST TALKED ABOUT SORRY I'VE GOT TOO EXCITED AND THEN THAT ENABLES YOU TO PROTECT YOUR RECOVERY ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON BUILDING UP UNTIL NOW
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00058	THAT IS THE POINT
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00060	Okay, now, so we know about the triangle, we know about the three Ps, the three Cs are really, it's kind of our take on a sort of a CBT-based
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00061	MODEL BUT IT'S BASICALLY WHAT TRIGGERS YOU WHAT YOU DO WHAT HAPPENS
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00063	BECAUSE USUALLY AS ADDICTS IF YOU'RE ANYTHING LIKE ME WELL YOU HAD A Q AND THEN YOU ATE YOUR DRUG
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00064	AND THEN YOU HAD A RESULT AS A RESULT OF EATING THE DRUG WHICH USUALLY STUNK, RIGHT? IT WASN'T WHERE YOU WANTED TO BE. SO BY BREAKING IT DOWN THIS WAY, WE CAN SEE THAT THE CUE IS A STIMULUS THAT TESTS OFF THE EVENT.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00065	THE CUSTOM IS WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU'RE TRIGGERED RIGHT AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE RESULT OF WHAT HAPPENS AFTER YOU'VE DONE THE BEHAVIOR OR ACTION OR THE SUBSTANCE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00066	THAT'S YOUR CUE RIGHT SO A CUE COULD BE ANYTHING LIKE BELIEVE IT OR NOT I WAS TRAINED AS AN ARTIST AND BREADBAKER NOT SO HELPFUL AS AN ADDICT BUT THE POINT IS THAT MY WIFE WAS IN THE KITCHEN AND SHE WAS LIKE SHLEPPING BUTTER ACROSS TOAST
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00067	AND I WORK RIGHT NEXT TO THE KITCHEN AND I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M TRIGGERED I'M LIKE TRYING TO WORK I'M LIKE HELPING ADDICTS AND LIKE HERE LIKE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00068	I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00069	OF WHAT ARE OUR CUES BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE PERSONAL TO US
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00071	AND SO WE HAVE TO BE GRATEFUL FOR OUR TRIGGERS
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00073	BOTTOM LINE, THEY GIVE US INFORMATION. BITTEN TALKED ABOUT THAT. WHAT DOES A RELAPSE GIVE YOU? IT GIVES YOU INFORMATION. THEN YOU CAN BECOME RESPONSIBLE TO DO SOMETHING BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00074	RIGHT THAT'S EMPOWERING THAT'S RECOVERY
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00076	ACCUSTOMED THAT'S THE REPEATED THING THAT YOU'VE DONE RIGHT DOING THE SAME THING YOU'VE ALWAYS DONE AND THEN YOU END UP WITH THE OH JEEBUS THEN YOU END UP WITH THE SAME RESULTS
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00078	THAT'S MY ALARM TO WAKE MY KIDS UP OKAY
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00080	BELIEVE IT OR NOT THERE'S ANOTHER ONE IN 15 MINUTES WE'LL GET THERE IN A SECOND SO BASICALLY LOOK AT THIS TIME OF DAY RIGHT LOTS OF PEOPLE GET TIRED AROUND 3 PM
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00081	CHEAPEST THAT'S RIGHT ABOUT NOW ISN'T IT SO WHAT DO WE DO WELL SOME OF YOU PROBABLY GOT SOME COFFEE OR SOME TEA RIGHT WE GET A FIX WE GET SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE THE WAY WE THINK OR FEEL RIGHT AND THEN WHAT'S THE CONSEQUENCE MAYBE YOU FEEL ASHAMED
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00083	MAYBE YOU'RE SAYING TO YOURSELF GOD WHY DID I DO THAT AGAIN I KNEW IT WAS GONNA HAPPEN AND I DID IT ANYWAY
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00084	SO RIGHT WE CAN CHANGE THE CUSTOM AND THEN WE CAN CHANGE THE CONSEQUENCE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00085	SO INSTEAD OF GRABBING A FIX WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A WALK OUTSIDE WHY DON'T YOU GET YOURSELF IN NATURE DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND YOU'LL GET SOMETHING DIFFERENT OKAY
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00087	BECAUSE WHEN YOU CHANGE YOUR CUSTOM YOU CHANGE YOUR CONSEQUENCE AND WHEN YOU CHANGE YOUR CONSEQUENCES YOU CHANGE YOUR LIFE AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO DO RIGHT YOU CAN'T LIVE THE WAY YOU LIVED BEFORE IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00089	ALRIGHT SO NOW WE'RE GONNA PLAY RIGHT SO WE DO A LOT OF THIS IN CIRCLE IT'S CALLED WORKING ALONE TOGETHER SO I WANT YOU TO GO AHEAD AND GRAB YOUR CARDS
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00090	OKAY YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT UM ACTUALLY BEFORE YOU DO THAT JUST GRAB A BLANK PIECE OF PAPER
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00092	OR BELIEVE IT OR NOT AS SOON AS I HIT THIS ARROW A TIMER'S GONNA START YOU'RE ONLY GONNA HAVE 60 SECONDS TO DO THIS
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00094	SO THIS IS THE PROMPT THAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE FOR THE TIMED EXERCISE YOU'RE GONNA SAY TO YOURSELF I KNOW MY RECOVERY IS IN TROUBLE WHEN I...
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00095	YOU'RE JUST GONNA BLAST OFF ANSWERS AS FAST AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN ON THE BLANK PAPER YES NOTHING'S RIGHT NOTHING'S WRONG
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00096	IT'S JUST YOUR RECOVERY AND WHEN YOU KNOW IT'S IN TROUBLE SO I'M GONNA WAIT FOR THIS FOLKS THAT SIT DOWN IN CASE THEY DIDN'T HAVE IT
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00097	THEN READY 5 4 3 2 1 ALREADY GOT A MINUTE I'M GONNA SHUT UP
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00099	IT'S NOT PLAYING
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00101	IT'S A PDF. I'LL JUST USE MY TIMER.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00103	SORRY IT'S A P D F SO I FORGOT SO
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00105	JUST KEEP GOING DON'T STOP AND LOOK AT THE TIMER
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00107	WE'LL GIVE IT 20 MORE SECONDS JUST KEEP WRITING UNTIL YOU CAN'T WRITE ANYMORE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00109	ALL RIGHT AS MY CLIENT AND WITH THE IS MY CO-WORKER AND I WOULD SAY THIS IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR GOVERNMENT WE'RE JUST GOING TO MOVE ON ALL RIGHT SO YOU'RE GOING TO PULL OUT YOUR CARDS
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00111	YOU'RE GONNA MAKE SURE THAT YOU SEE IN FRONT OF YOU THE TOP CARD HERE NOT THE BOTTOM SO THERE'S THERE'S TWO SIDES RIGHT SHOULD BE A ONE IN THE BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER OF YOUR CARD
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00113	OKAY NOW WE'RE GONNA DO IS WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU 30 SECONDS YOU'RE JUST GONNA PICK A CUE FROM YOUR LIST ONE THAT YOU FEEL YOU COULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT WOULD BE IDEAL
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00114	AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA WRITE IT IN THE CUE LINE ON THE FIRST SIDE AND ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE CARD SO ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PICK A CUE WRITE IT DOWN ON THE CUE LINE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE CARD
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00116	I'LL GIVE YOU 30 SECONDS TO DO THAT
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00118	IF YOU'RE DONE, SHOW ME YOUR PEN.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00120	ALL RIGHT ABOUT HALF THERE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00122	DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PRETTY TO WORK THAT'S THE GOOD THING OKAY NOW THINK ABOUT YOUR CUE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00124	IS IT THE BAY
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00126	IS IT GUILT OR IS IT ROMANCE? MAYBE IT'S ALL THREE. THAT'S OKAY. JUST CIRCLE THE ONES THAT APPLY.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00128	IF YOU'RE NOT SURE CIRCLE DEBATE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00130	TRUST YOUR GUT TOO
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00132	SOMETIMES WE OVERTHINK THINGS. LET ME REPHRASE. AS ADDICTS, WE ALWAYS OVERTHINK THINGS.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00134	SO IT'S THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT ADDICTION RIGHT IT'S REALLY PIRATING OUR MIND FROM AN INSTINCTIVE PART OF OUR BRAIN
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00135	SO WE REALLY HAVE TO TRUST OUR KNOWING TO KIND OF GET PAST THAT AND START TO BUILD THIS THE BLUE DOG WHERE BITTEN WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT'S THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX THAT'S THE HUMAN BRAIN IT'S A VERY
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00136	CAPABLE PART OF OUR BRAIN BUT IF YOU CAN'T REACH IT IT'S USELESS TO YOU THAT'S WHY YOU CAN'T THINK YOUR WAY OUT OF ADDICTION YOU HAVE TO WORK YOUR WAY OUT OF ADDICTION YOU HAVE TO DO STUFF
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00137	OKAY
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00139	Now, the custom. So, when you're in your queue,
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00141	WHAT DO YOU NORMALLY DO?
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00143	WHAT HAPPENS? WHAT'S YOUR BEHAVIOR?
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00145	NOT WHAT THE RESULT IS BUT WHAT IS THE THING YOU DO FOLLOWING YOUR CUE JUST WRITE IT DOWN
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00147	WRONG ANSWERS
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00149	AND NOW
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00151	What's the result of the behavior that you've done, that you've written on your card? Where does that take you? What is the consequence?
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00153	KIND OF DIG DEEP HERE IT'S NOT JUST THAT YOU DRUG OR THAT YOU
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00155	DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR YOU DRUG OR
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00156	GET LIKE VISCERAL AND GUTSY AND BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO GO HERE RIGHT WE DON'T WANT TO GO BACK THERE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00158	PAIN IS THE THING THAT MOTIVATES US AS ADDICTS SOMETIMES GET INTO THAT THEY'LL TEACH YOU SOMETHING
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00160	ALL RIGHT NOW YOU'RE GOING TO FLIP YOUR CARD OVER ALL RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO PLAY WITH THE THREE P'S A LITTLE BIT RIGHT SO BASICALLY WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE YOU DO IS HOW WILL YOU PLAN HOW WILL YOU PREPARE AND HOW WILL YOU PROTECT
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00161	WHEN YOU GET THIS TRIGGER OR CUE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00163	BASICALLY WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00165	YOU CAN ALWAYS ELABORATE ON YOUR PLAN TOO BUT THE POINT IS THAT IF YOU HAVE A NUMBERED SYSTEM THAT YOU WOULD IMPLEMENT YOU WOULD JUST DO THOSE THINGS IN ORDER
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00166	AND THAT'S GOING TO TAKE YOU FURTHER AWAY FROM YOUR TRIGGER CLOSER TO YOUR RECOVERY RIGHT RELAPSE AND RECOVERY HAPPEN ON A PARADIGM RIGHT YOU HAVE RECOVERY OVER HERE AND RELAPSE OVER HERE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00167	AND YOU HAVE TO WORK YOUR WAY AWAY FROM RECOVERY IN ORDER TO WORK YOUR WAY TOWARDS RELAPSE SO BY DOING THESE ACTIONS YOU'RE WORKING YOUR WAY FROM RELAPSE BACK TOWARDS RECOVERY BACK TO WHERE YOU WANNA GO
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00169	IT'S POSSIBLE TO SOMEONE TO BE IN A RELAPSE FOR A VERY LONG TIME BEFORE THEY PICK UP A DRUG
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00171	HAPPENS MORE OFTEN THAN YOU THINK.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00173	THAT'S WHY WE WANT TO WORK OUR WAY BACKWARDS
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00175	ALRIGHT SO YOU DID YOUR PLANNING YOU DID YOUR PLANNING PREPARING YOU DID YOUR PROTECTING
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00177	WHAT'S THE CONSEQUENCE OF THOSE THREE THINGS WHERE DOES THAT GET YOU HOW DO YOU FEEL WHICH DAY ARE YOU IN
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00179	WHAT ARE THE WORDS THAT YOU WOULD USE TO DESCRIBE WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00181	THIS IS THE REALITY FOLKS YOUR RECOVERY HAS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM YOUR ADDICTION CREATES IT'S THAT SIMPLE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00182	IT HAS TO SOLVE ALL OF THE PROBLEMS THAT YOUR ADDICTION CREATES AND GUESS WHAT YOUR RED DOG WILL MORPH
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00183	IT WILL DO WHATEVER IT HAS TO DO TO MAKE YOU MISERABLE. NOT EVEN KILL YOU, JUST MAKE YOU MISERABLE. SO WE NEED TO STAY ON TOP OF THIS. AND THAT'S WHY THIS ISN'T SOMETHING YOU DO ONCE.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00184	RIGHT I JUST RECENTLY MOVED I HAVE TWO YOUNG KIDS RIGHT I DON'T HAVE THE TRIGGERS I USED TO HAVE I HAVE A TWO-YEAR-OLD THREE-YEAR-OLD SHE DOESN'T PLAY INDEPENDENTLY
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00185	LIKE SHE DOESN'T WANT TO IT DRIVES ME NUTS LIKE THAT'S A TRIGGER THAT WASN'T A TRIGGER WHEN I DIDN'T HAVE A THREE YEAR OLD SO IT'S SOMETHING IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE LIKE SO CLOSE TO THE DRUG IT JUST CAN BE ANYTHING THAT YOU FEEL A LITTLE OFF ABOUT
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00186	AND BY TAKING AN INVENTORY YOU REALLY KNOW WHAT YOUR RECOVERY HAS TO BE MADE OF BECAUSE IF YOU MISS ONE OF THESE THINGS IT COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO RELAPSE RIGHT
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00187	BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT PROTECTING YOUR RECOVERY SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE AN INVENTORY SO THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO TELL YOU IS THAT WE HAVE A FREE EVENT ACTUALLY STARTS ON MONDAY I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO BE THERE BECAUSE I'M GOING TO BE IN AN AIRPLANE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00188	BASICALLY IT TAKES YOU THROUGH OUR SYSTEM AND THE FINAL DAY IS PRETTY MUCH THIS IT'S RECOVERY PROTECTION 101 WE CALL IT STAYING STOPPED
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00189	SO IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR YOU'RE INTERESTED JUST FIND ME OR ONE OF MY PEOPLE AT THE TABLE OVER THERE THEY CAN GIVE YOU SOME INFORMATION AND I WANTED TO GIVE SOME TIME TO ANSWER QUESTIONS I KNOW THERE'S NOT A TON OF TIME LEFT UM BUT
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00190	SO SHOOT I GUESS
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00002	Thank you so much. Good afternoon, everybody. My name indeed is Daniela Besana. And as anticipated, I'm part of an international Microsoft team.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00003	UM BUT USE NAME IS GLOBAL BLACK BELT UM
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00004	WHO IS FOCUSED ON HELPING OUR CUSTOMERS TO GET THE MOST OUT OF THEIR HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00005	WORKLOADS BY RUNNING THEM ON MICROSOFT AZURE CLOUD.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00006	TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO SPEND THE NEXT 10 MINUTES TOGETHER TO BRING YOU THROUGH SOME OF EXAMPLES
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00007	WE HAVE UM ABOUT UH HOW UH MICROSOFT AZURE TOGETHER WITH THE SPECIFIC PARTNERS CAN ACTUALLY BOOST IN SILICON MEDICINE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00008	FIRST OF ALL I WOULD LIKE TO START FROM THE VISION
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00009	THAT MICROSOFT HAS ABOUT HOW MICROSOFT CAN ACTUALLY HELP IN JOURNEYS CUSTOMER JOURNEYS AND END USERS JOURNEYS RELATED TO HEALTH CARE AND LIFE SCIENCE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00010	AND THE IDEA IS ACTUALLY TO LET'S SAY MOVE AWAY FROM A TRADITIONAL APPROACH
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00011	WHERE THE PATIENT IS SOMEONE THAT IS BROUGHT THROUGH ALREADY WELL-DEFINED PROCESSES
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00012	AND THE IDEA IS TO MOVE TO TO TO EMBRACE A VISION
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00013	WHERE THE PATIENT CAN ACTUALLY BE AT THE CENTER OF MULTIPLE PROCESSES OR MULTIPLE APPROACHES.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00014	AMONG THEM THERE ARE FOR EXAMPLE THE POSSIBILITY TO DEVELOP PERSONALIZED TREATMENTS
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00015	UM THE POSSIBILITY TO ENABLE EFFECTIVE CLINICAL TRIALS
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00016	WITH THE PURPOSE OF HELPING TO MAKE NEW DRUGS AVAILABLE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00017	IN SHORTER TIME FRAMES UH REDUCING COST AND UM UNLEASHING RESOURCES FOR ADDITIONAL RESEARCH
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00018	AND ALSO ALLOW WHAT HAS BECOME OVER THE LAST YEARS A TYPICAL APPROACH TO HAVE MULTIPLE RESEARCH GROUPS COLLABORATING ACROSS THE GLOBE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00019	THE IDEA IS ACTUALLY TO AH HELP AH THOSE GROUPS TO BETTER WORK AND WORK MORE EFFECTIVELY TOGETHER
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00020	SO CLOUD IN GENERAL MAY BECOME BY DEFINITION UM A NEW APPROACH IN IT INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH MAY DEFINITELY HELP ALL THESE APPROACHES
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00021	AND MICROSOFT AZURE CLOUD IN PARTICULAR IS CHARACTERIZED BY MULTIPLE FEATURES AND CHARACTERISTICS AND APPROACHES AND ARCHITECTURES
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00022	THAT MAY EVEN PROVIDE MORE IN IN IN THIS FRAMEWORK
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00024	FIRST OF ALL I WOULD LIKE ALSO TO PROVIDE YOU SOME GENERAL EXAMPLE NOT ONLY FROM A TECHNOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE BUT ALSO FROM A PROGRAM PERSPECTIVE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00025	MICROSOFT IN FACT IS INVOLVED IN THIS PART OF THE SO-CALLED COVID-19 HPC CONSORTIUM
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00026	WHICH IS COLLECTING THE MAJOR I.T. PROVIDERS TO MAKE COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00027	FOR UH SIMULATIONS AND ANYTHING WHICH MAY BE REQUIRED TO SPEED UP UH RESEARCH RELATED TO COVID-19
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00028	ON THE OTHER HAND, MICROSOFT HAS ALSO LAUNCHED A FIVE YEARS PROGRAM WHICH IS A 60 MILLION DOLLARS PROGRAM
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00029	UM AND IT IS A PHILANTHROPIC PROGRAM WHICH HAS BASICALLY THE PURPOSE TO PROVIDE THE COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES UM CONSULTANCY UH IN ORDER TO EMPOWER
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00030	RESEARCHERS AND ORGANIZATIONS TO EXPLOIT AND DEVELOP ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SOLUTIONS IN THE HEALTHCARE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00032	IN PARTICULAR AN APPROACH THAT MICROSOFT IS KEEN TO PURSUE IS TO ESTABLISH SIGNIFICANT PARTNERSHIPS
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00033	UM MICROSOFT IS A IS A GREAT TECHNOLOGICAL AND SOLUTION PROVIDER
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00034	BUT IS ALSO VERY KEEN TO LET'S SAY GET THE MOST OUT OF WHAT IS AVAILABLE FROM THE MARKET TO PROVIDE THE BEST SOLUTIONS
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00035	TO OUR JOINT END USERS. SO I THINK THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT THING TO DO.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00036	AND FOR SURE ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PARTNERS WE HAVE IN IN THIS FRAMEWORK
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00037	AND THAT IS DEFINITELY HOSTING US FOR FOR THIS SPEECH AND FOR THIS CONFERENCE IS ACTUALLY CATFEM MEDICAL
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00038	AS YOU KNOW, CADFEM MEDICAL HAS DEVELOPED A PLATFORM CALLED DOCTU
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00039	UM THAT HAS BASICALLY THE PURPOSE TO ALLOW UH SIMULATIONS AND ANSYS SIMULATIONS IN
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00040	IN PARTICULAR TO MAKE THEM AVAILABLE TO BE USED BY DOCTORS AND MEDICAL STAFF
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00041	TO RESOLVE MULTIPLE POSSIBLE ISSUES IN THE SO-CALLED IN SILICO MEDICINE.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00042	DOC Q IS A A SCALABLE AND FLEXIBLE SOFTWARE PLATFORM AND THAT'S WHY IT'S WORKING VERY WELL WITH THE MICROSOFT AZURE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00043	BECAUSE OF IT'S SCALABLE AND FLEXIBLE INFRASTRUCTURE AND SOLUTION THAT MICROSOFT AZURE CAN ACTUALLY PROVIDE.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00044	DOCQ CORE IS THE PLATFORM AND OVER THERE THERE ARE MULTIPLE MODULES WHICH MAY RESPOND TO MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00045	HERE WE HAVE CHOSEN TO CONSIDER A FEW EXAMPLES OUT OF THE MULTIPLE ONES THAT THE CATFEM MEDICAL MAY PROVIDE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00047	ONE IS DOC URP WHICH HAS BEEN DESIGNED FOR SURGICAL PLANNING OF FORCED MAXILLARY EXPANSIONS FOR EXAMPLE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00048	HERE THE PLATFORM DOCQ PLATFORM TOGETHER WITH MICROSOFT HAS ALLOWED TO DEVELOP OR TO RUN UP TO 100 BIOMECHANICAL SIMULATIONS IN JUST 15 MINUTES
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00049	ANOTHER PLATFORM IS DOCQ OSA THAT SUPPORTS THE DIAGNOSIS AND THERAPY OF OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00050	ALSO IN THIS CASE AH TYPICAL HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING AH FLUID DYNAMICS AND FSI SIMULATIONS ARE USED AND EXPLOITED
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00051	BUT THIS TIME NOT WITH THE TYPICAL IDEA OF DEVELOP OF USING THEM IN TYPICAL MANUFACTURING ENVIRONMENTS BUT TO LEVERAGE THEM FOR INSILICO MEDICINE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00052	AND DOCU VIT IS USED FOR VIRTUAL IMPLANT TESTING IN THIS CASE SCALABILITY IS REALLY A PLUS
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00053	AND MICROSOFT AZURE BECAUSE OF ITS INFRASTRUCTURE IS ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS AH HORIZONTAL SCALABILITY ALLOWING A MASSIVE REDUCTION OF SIMULATION TIMES
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00054	ANOTHER EXAMPLE UH WHICH IS REALLY INTERESTING TO ME UH IS UH RELATED TO SIMULATIONS RELATED UH UH TO ARTERY DRUG DELIVERY
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00055	AH AS YOU CAN ALSO SEE HERE THE IDEA IS ACTUALLY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW DRUGS ARE DISTRIBUTED INSIDE OUR BODY BASED ON MULTIPLE VARIABLES
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00056	IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MINIMIZE DRUG CONCENTRATION IN HEALTHY TISSUES AND MAXIMIZE DRUG CONCENTRATION IN DAMAGED ISSUES
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00057	SO OUR MICROSOFT CLOUD CAN ACTUALLY HELP IN WE HAVE SEEN WITH CATFIRM MEDICAL SOME GREAT EXAMPLES
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00058	BUT WE COULD BRING MULTIPLE EXAMPLES AGAIN WITH CADFEM MEDICAL ADDITIONAL ONES AND WITH OTHER PARTNERS.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00059	ACTUALLY THE MICROSOFT CLOUD HAS DECIDED TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING SPECIFIC ARCHITECTURE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00060	SO IT'S NOT AZURE IT'S NOT A GENERAL PURPOSE CLOUD THAT MAY ALSO DO I PERFORMANCE COMPUTING
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00061	BUT INSIDE MICROSOFT AZURE CLOUD THERE ARE SOME SPECIFIC ARCHITECTURES AND COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES THAT HAVE BEEN DESIGNED ON PURPOSE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00062	TO PROVIDE THE BEST ENVIRONMENT FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING WORKLOADS. HERE ON THE RIGHT YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THEM
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00063	BECAUSE AH AH UM HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING WORKLOADS MAY HAVE AH DIFFERENT MAY HAVE MANY CHARACTERISTICS IN TERMS OF ARCHITECTURE IN COMMON
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00064	BUT MAY BE VERY DIFFERENT ONE FROM FROM THE OTHER IN TERMS OF THE COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES WHICH MAY BE REQUIRED
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00065	FOR EXAMPLE AS YOU KNOW VERY WELL IN SOME CASES WORKLOADS ARE VERY CPU INTENSIVE IN OTHER CASES THEY ARE MORE GPU INTENSIVE AND THERE ARE MULTIPLE OTHER CHARACTERISTICS
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00066	SO THE IDEA IS REALLY THROUGH MICROSOFT AZURE CLOUD TO PROVIDE A VERY BIG RANGE OF AVAILABLE ARCHITECTURE AND COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00067	SO THAT EACH WORKLOAD EACH AH HPC WORKLOAD MAY ACTUALLY FIND THE RIGHT DESIGN THE RIGHT ARCHITECTURE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00068	AND WITH A GREATER FLEXIBILITY AS YOU CAN SEE HERE IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED MAY BE AVAILABLE EXACTLY WHEN THEY NEEDED
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00069	BUT UH ONLY IF IT NEEDED SO UH WITH NO UH THE IDEA IS REALLY TO PAY FOR WHAT IS USED AND TO HAVE RESOURCES AVAILABLE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00070	BUT BASICALLY NOT TO DESIGN AND PAY FOR INFRASTRUCTURES DESIGNED FOR PEEKS BUT THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THE PEEKS
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00071	ALSO LEVERAGING AZURE CLOUD ALLOWS ALSO FIRST OF ALL TO SCALE AS NEEDED
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00072	SO AS WE WERE SAYING DOCQ IS A KIND OF WORKLOAD THAT IS ACTUALLY REQUIRING THE CAPABILITY TO SCALE BUT ALSO THE POSSIBILITY TO LEVERAGE THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00073	SO EVERY SIX MONTHS EVERY ONE YEAR EVERY THREE MONTHS SOME COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES ARE SUBJECT TO TECHNOLOGICAL REFRESH
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00074	AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IN THE CLOUD IS MADE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE WHILE ON THE CONTRARY ON-PROMISES RESOURCES MAY ARE NORMALLY REFRESHED IN A THREE YEARS FIVE YEARS TIME FRAME
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00075	THAT SAID WE ARE AT THE END OF OUR TEN MINUTES ANOTHER KEY PIECE OF INFORMATION I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00076	IS THAT MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN ALSO DESIGNED AND IS CONSTANTLY MAINTAINED TO ALLOW THE LARGEST POSSIBLE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00077	AS FAR AS PUBLIC HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES AND LIFE SCIENCE AND PHARMACEUTICALS ARE CONCERNED SO WITH THAT I DEFINITELY WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00078	REMIND YOU THAT IN THIS 10 MINUTES WE HAVE JUST PROVIDED SOME GREAT EXAMPLES OF COLLABORATIONS WITH CAFE MEDICAL
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00079	BUT WE KNOW THAT THE RANGE OF SOLUTIONS WHICH MAY BE NEEDED FOR IN SILICONE MEDICINE IS HUGE.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00080	AND I WOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO DISCUSS THEM AND UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN SUPPORT YOU IN FOR OTHER SOLUTIONS AND NEEDED YOU MAY HAVE.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00081	WITH THE WITH THAT IF THERE'S ANY QUESTION AND IF WE HAVE STILL SOME TIME AVAILABLE I WILL BE VERY HAPPY TO RESPOND IF NOT REALLY THANK YOU
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00083	THANK YOU VERY MUCH DANIELA BEZANA
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00002	I hope that we have conveyed the fact that there's quite a few activities
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00003	THAT ARE ONGOING AND ARE BEING INITIATED BOTH IN COLLABORATION WITH THE STANFORD CENTER
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00004	AS WELL AS ACTIVELY PURSUED WITHIN OUR HARVARD AFFILIATED HOSPITALS AND CLOSE COLLABORATORS IN THE ORGANIZATION.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00005	WE WOULD HOPE TO USE THIS EXPERIENCE AND TO EXPAND UPON IT TO CREATE A VERY SPECIAL OPPORTUNITY IN THE FIELD OF ME-CFS.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00006	BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE DO NEED SUPPORT FROM THE COMMUNITY WE NEED PARTICIPATION IN OUR IN OUR STUDIES
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00007	WE NEED PARTICIPATION IN OUR STUDIES WE NEED PARTICIPATION IN OUR STUDIES AND WE NEED PARTICIPATION IN OUR STUDIES AND I WE NEED PARTICIPATION IN OUR STUDIES AND I WOULD WE NEED PARTICIPATION IN OUR STUDIES AND I WOULD HOPE WE NEED PARTICIPATION IN OUR STUDIES AND I WOULD HOPE THAT WE NEED PARTICIPATION IN OUR STUDIES AND I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD AND I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD AND I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD HAVE AND I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD HAVE AN AND I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY AND I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO FIND HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO FIND
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00008	TO FIND INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO FIND INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO OUR SUPPORT AND EVEN EXPANSION OF OUR SUPPORT AND EVEN EXPANSION OF OUR SUPPORT AND EVEN EXPANSION OF THESE ACTIVITIES OVER THE UPCOMING THESE ACTIVITIES OVER THE UPCOMING THESE ACTIVITIES OVER THE UPCOMING MONTHS AND YEARS. MONTHS AND YEARS.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00009	SO THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A SHAMELESS PLEA FOR FINANCES AND I THINK LINDA HAS A COUPLE OF SLIDES HERE THAT SHE WANTED TO GO OVER.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00010	BUT WE WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING PUBLIC EVENTS GOING FORWARD IN WHICH WE CAN SHARE WITH THE COMMUNITY AND PROFESSIONALS IN THE NORTHEAST AREA OUR PROGRESS
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00011	WITH RESPECT TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CENTER AND ALL OF ITS COLLABORATIONS. THERE IS VERY STRONG INTENT AND INTEREST AMONG THE HARVARD AFFILIATED HOSPITALS.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00012	AS WELL AS OUR COLLEAGUES HERE IN BOSTON YOU KNOW WE ARE WE ARE
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00014	REALLY UM
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00016	blessed to have many medical and other academic institutions who have very special facilities
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00017	AND I JUST WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT THERE IS A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO MAKE A MASSIVE IMPACT
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00018	ON A BETTER UNDERSTANDING THE POSSIBILITY OF BIOMARKERS AND THE POSSIBILITY OF IDENTIFYING NEW TREATMENTS IN THE FIELD OF ME-CFS.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00019	THE POSSIBILITY OF BIOMARKERS AND THE POSSIBILITY OF IDENTIFYING UM NEW TREATMENTS IN THE FIELD OF M E C F S AND THE POSSIBILITY OF IDENTIFYING UM NEW TREATMENTS IN THE FIELD OF M E C F S AND THE POSSIBILITY OF IDENTIFYING UM NEW TREATMENTS IN THE FIELD OF M E C F S AND THE POSSIBILITY OF IDENTIFYING UM NEW TREATMENTS IN THE FIELD OF M E C F S AND THE POSSIBILITY OF IDENTIFYING UM NEW TREATMENTS IN THE FIELD OF M E C F S AND THE POSSIBILITY OF IDENTIFYING UM NEW TREATMENTS IN THE FIELD OF M E C F S AND THE POSSIBILITY OF IDENTIFY
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00020	AND INTEREST. WE COULD EASILY DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF SCIENTISTS AND CLINICIANS WITHIN THE HARVARD AFFILIATED HOSPITALS BUT ALL OF THIS DOES TAKE MONEY.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00021	AND WE WOULD APPRECIATE IF AS YOU GO AWAY TO THINK ABOUT HOW YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP IN THIS ENDEAVOR. WE ARE FULLY COMMITTED TO
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00022	AND WE HOPE THAT YOU GAIN SOME CONFIDENCE AND SOME COMFORT IN THE FACT THAT
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00024	WE HOPE THAT YOU GAIN SOME CONFIDENCE AND UM THAT THERE IS A COMMITMENT UH WITHIN CONFIDENCE AND UM THAT THERE IS A COMMITMENT UH WITHIN CONFIDENCE AND UM THAT THERE IS A COMMITMENT UH WITHIN THE ORGANIZATIONS AND THE THAT THERE IS A COMMITMENT UH WITHIN THE ORGANIZATIONS AND THE THAT THERE IS A COMMITMENT UH WITHIN THE ORGANIZATIONS AND THE INSTITUTIONS
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00026	OF THE COMMITMENT UM WITHIN THE ORGANIZATIONS AND THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE COMMITMENT UM WITHIN THE ORGANIZATIONS AND THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE COMMITMENT UM WITHIN THE ORGANIZATIONS OF THE COMMITMENT UM WITHIN THE ORGANIZATIONS OF THE COMMITMENT UM WITHIN THE ORGANIZATIONS OF THE COMMITMENT UM WITHIN THE ORGANIZATIONS OF THE COMMITMENT UM WITHIN THE ORGANIZATIONS OF THE COMMITMENT UM WITHIN THE ORGANIZATIONS OF THE COMMITMENT UM WITHIN THE ORGANIZATIONS OF THE COMMITMENT UM WITHIN THE ORGANIZATIONS OF THE COMMITMENT UM WITHIN THE ORGANIZATIONS OF THE COMMITMENT UM WITHIN THE ORGANIZATIONS OF THE COMMITMENT UM WITHIN THE ORGANIZATIONS OF THE COMMITMENT UM WITHIN THE ORGANIZ
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00028	I'M REALLY OVERWHELMED WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00029	WE ARE ABLE TO HAVE RESEARCHERS GETTING TOGETHER AT STANFORD AND AT HARVARD AND AT UPSALA AND REALLY AT OTHER PLACES AROUND THE WORLD THAT WE'RE COLLABORATING WITH WHEN IT'S AUSTRALIA AND WITH CANADA AND WITH THE UK AND
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00030	A LOT OF OTHER RESEARCHERS THAT AREN'T HERE TODAY BUT THAT ARE BEHIND THE SCENES WORKING ON ME CFS WITH US AND WITH OTHER PEOPLE
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00031	AND WE TRY TO BRING THEM ALL TOGETHER TO TALK TO EACH OTHER AND WE TRY TO FUND AND ONLY FUND OPEN COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00032	AND ONLY FUND OPEN COLLABORATIVE UM RESEARCH AND ONLY FUND OPEN COLLABORATIVE UM RESEARCH AND IT'S REALLY OVERWHELMING TO THINK THAT THIS IS REALLY OVERWHELMING TO THINK THAT THIS IS REALLY OVERWHELMING TO THINK THAT THIS IS FINALLY HAPPENED, IT'S A DREAM FINALLY HAPPENED, IT'S A DREAM FINALLY HAPPENED, IT'S A DREAM COME TRUE TO GET ALL THESE COME TRUE TO GET ALL THESE COME TRUE TO GET ALL THESE BRILLIANT PEOPLE TOGETHER.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00033	AND WHAT WE REALLY WANT YOU TO TAKE HOME TODAY IS THE HOPE THAT'S OUT THERE AND THE HOPE THAT WE ALL SHARE THAT RESEARCH IS REALLY HAPPENING IN A BIG WAY
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00034	AND WE JUST NEED TO HELP SCALE IT UP BECAUSE UNTIL NIH KICKS IN MORE MONEY TO BE ABLE TO HELP US DO THIS, WE NEED TO DO THIS WITH PRIVATE FUNDING.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00035	SO LET ME JUST FIRST START BY THANKING THE SPEAKERS WHO SPOKE TODAY WHICH IS WONDERFUL FOR EVERYTHING THAT THEY'RE DOING AND THE SPEAKERS THAT CAME YESTERDAY AND THE RESEARCHERS AND CLINICIANS
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00036	THAT NOT ONLY CAME YESTERDAY TO BRING THEIR EXPERTISE TO THE TABLE BUT HAVE BEEN HELPING US AT THE STANFORD COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH CENTER AND HERE AT THIS COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH CENTER AND NOW UPSALA
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00037	WE HAVE WAY OVER 80 TO 90 DIFFERENT RESEARCHERS THAT ARE REALLY CONCENTRATING ON THIS AND WANTING TO MAKE REAL INROADS INTO WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE BODY OF PATIENTS
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00038	SO WE CAN TREAT AND WE CAN CURE THIS ILLNESS AND REALLY FIND OUT WHAT IS HAPPENING AT THE MOLECULAR LEVEL AND WHAT IS HAPPENING SO WE CAN CAUSE FIND OUT WHAT THE CAUSE IS IN THE BODY SO WE CAN TREAT IT AND CURE THIS AND PUT THIS IN THE PAST.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00039	AND WE CAN TREAT IT AND WE CAN TREAT IT AND WE CAN TREAT IT AND WE CAN TREAT IT AND WE CAN TREAT IT AND WE CAN TREAT IT AND WE CAN TREAT IT AND WE CAN TREAT IT AND WE CAN TREAT IT AND WE CAN TREAT IT AND WE CAN TREAT IT AND WE CAN TREAT IT AND WE CAN TREAT IT AND WE CAN TREAT IT AND WE CAN TREAT IT AND WE CAN TREAT IT AND WE CAN TREAT IT AND WE CAN TREAT IT AND WE CAN TREAT IT AND WE CAN TREAT IT AND WE CAN TREAT IT AND WE CAN TREAT IT AND WE CAN TREAT IT AND WE CAN TREAT IT AND WE CAN TREAT IT AND WE CAN TREAT IT AND WE CAN TREAT IT AND WE CAN TREAT IT AND WE CAN TREAT IT AND WE CAN TREAT IT AND WE CAN TREAT IT AND WE CAN TREAT IT
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00040	AND WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO FUND A CENTER OF EXCELLENCE HERE AT HARVARD
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00041	AND THEN HOPEFULLY AT MULTIPLE CENTER OF EXCELLENCES AROUND THE WORLD SO THAT PATIENTS CAN ACTUALLY SEE PATIENTS, PATIENTS CAN ACTUALLY SEE CLINICIANS THAT CAN ACTUALLY TREAT AND HELP AND SUPPORT THEIR ILLNESS AS THEY'RE GETTING THROUGH THIS.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00042	I WANT TO THANK THE ORGANIZERS OF TODAY AND YESTERDAY, RON TOMPKINS AND WEN ZONGZHAO AND ANDREW ALEXANDER AND MARYLAND SIMON-GURZIK AND DEBBIE HUSH DID A FABULOUS JOB
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00043	AND I WANT TO THANK THE VOLUNTEERS WHO HELPED TODAY FROM MASS ME CFS FM ORGANIZATION THAT HELPED US WITH REGISTRATION AND ALL WE CAN'T DO THESE TYPE OF ACTIVITIES WITHOUT ALL OF YOUR HELP
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00044	AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE FABULOUS JOB THAT YOU HAD AND I WANT TO ESPECIALLY THANK THE PATIENTS HERE AND REALLY ALL OVER THE WORLD THAT ARE REALLY SACRIFICING THEMSELVES FOR THIS RESEARCH
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00045	BECAUSE WE COULDN'T DO THIS RESEARCH WITHOUT YOUR SAMPLES AND WITHOUT YOU ANSWERING SURVEYS AND QUESTIONS AND BEING BOTHERED AND HAVING YOU SPEND YOUR ENERGY TO HELP US FIND ANSWERS FOR MANY, MANY MORE PEOPLE THAT ARE SUFFERING OUT THERE.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00046	AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO SPECIFICALLY THANK THE DONORS SOME ARE HERE TODAY IN THE AUDIENCE AND THEY'RE ALL OVER THE WORLD WHO ARE LISTENING AS WELL WE COULD NOT DO ANY OF THIS RESEARCH WITHOUT YOU BECAUSE ALL OF IT IS PRIVATELY FUNDED
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00047	SO I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FIRST AND I JUST WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO DO THAT IF YOU CAN PLEASE SHARE WITH ME
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00049	I'VE MOSTLY SAID WHAT'S ALREADY ON THIS SLIDE BUT WITH NIH HAVING A $39 BILLION BUDGET WE HOPE SOME DAY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE MORE MONEY FOR ME-CFS FUNDING.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00050	AND IT MAY TAKE US GETTING A BIOMARKER FOR THEM TO STEP UP THEIR FUNDING SO WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIND A DIAGNOSTIC AND A BIOMARKER AND ALSO OF COURSE TO FIND TREATMENTS AND TO PUSH SOME PILOTS GOING AND SOME TREATMENTS.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00051	AND AND AND AND GET THIS GOING FROM PRIVATE FUNDING AT THIS POINT.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00052	SO I MEAN MY GOAL IS TO RAISE 5200 MILLION DOLLARS AND REALLY SCALE UP THIS RESEARCH WE HAVE SO MANY RESEARCHERS THAT COULD SPEND MUCH MORE TIME ON THIS IF WE HAD MORE FUNDING
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00053	SO WE'RE ASKING FOR PHILANTHROPISTS OUT THERE WE'RE ASKING FOR PEOPLE WHO REALLY WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN MEDICAL RESEARCH AND IN HELPING PEOPLE GET THEIR LIVES BACK ALL OVER THE WORLD SO I WILL GO ANYWHERE ANYTIME TO MEET WITH PEOPLE WHO WANT TO KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING AND WHY
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00054	AND SO WE ASK FOR YOUR HELP TO HELP US INTRODUCE US TO THOSE PEOPLE
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00055	BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR HELPING US CONTINUE THIS AND HELPING US SCALE THIS UP OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS. WE'VE STARTED THE FOUNDATION IN 2012 AND WE'VE REALLY STARTED A LOT OF RESEARCH IN THE LAST FEW YEARS.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00056	IT'S REALLY ON A REAL GRAPH GOING WAY HIGH QUICKLY SO WE NEED YOUR HELP TO HELP SCALE THAT UP WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO IS SET UP CENTER OF EXCELLENCE HERE LIKE I SAID EVERYWHERE
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00057	BECAUSE IF WE DON'T HAVE CLINICIANS SEEING PATIENTS WE DON'T HAVE RESEARCH AND THE PATIENTS CAN'T SEE CLINICIANS THEY CAN'T BE HELPED
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00058	SO ONE THING WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE A REAL BIG EFFORT IS FOR MEDICAL EDUCATION AND TO BRING CLINICIANS NUMBER ONE TO HARVARD HERE AT A CENTER OF EXCELLENCE TO HELP
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00059	PATIENTS BE ABLE TO HAVE NOT ONLY SERVICES BUT ALSO TO HAVE A TRAINING GROUND FOR OTHER CLINICIANS TO BE ABLE TO TRAIN THEM HERE AND THEN SEND THEM OUT TO HELP PATIENTS EVERYWHERE AND THEN TO FEED ALL THE RESEARCH THAT'S GOING TO BE HAPPENING ALL OVER THE WORLD.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00060	SO THAT'S WHAT WE CALL A CENTER OF EXCELLENCE AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I HEAR SOMEBODY COMMENTED ON EARLIER THAT THEY TRIED TO DO BEFORE WE NEED TO DO THIS NOW
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00061	AND AS WE HAVE HERE NOW TIME IS NOT OUR FRIEND AND WE REALLY NEED TO FIND ANSWERS NOW BUT I WANT YOU TO COME GO HOME FROM HERE AND UNDERSTAND AND AND BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE REALLY DO CARE AND PEOPLE ARE WORKING ON THIS ALL OVER THE WORLD
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00062	AND WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER WE ALL WANT ANSWERS AND WE ALL WANT TO HELP AND GET PATIENTS THEIR LIVES BACK SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SPENDING THE TIME WITH US TODAY AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR INPUT AND YOUR HELP AS PATIENTS AS DONORS AS SUPPORTERS
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00063	AND WE HOPE TO CONTINUE WHAT WE'RE DOING AND REALLY SCALE IT UP AND THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00065	FOR JOINING US. WE HAVE THIS IN YOUR PACKET. IT'S JUST A POST CARD OF HOW IF YOU MIGHT WANT TO GET INVOLVED. WE DO WANT TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE JUST TO TELL AS MANY PEOPLE AS YOU CAN ABOUT ME-CFS.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00066	WE REALLY WANT TO INCREASE THEIR AWARENESS AND REALLY INCREASE PEOPLE KNOWING ABOUT IT AND SO I WON'T GO OVER THESE DETAILS BUT WE HAVE THIS IN YOUR PACKET THANK YOU VERY MUCH
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00002	All of my research has focused on a cow that has just had a baby. So cows have to have a baby once a year in order to make milk.
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00004	BUT WHEN THEY HAVE THE BABY THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT CHALLENGES AND STRESSORS IN THEIR ENVIRONMENTS THAT MAKE MANY OF THEM SUSCEPTIBLE TO DISEASE.
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00005	SO MY RESEARCH IS REALLY FOCUSING ON MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE COWS AND HOW THESE INFLUENCE THEIR RISK OF DISEASE AFTER THEY HAVE THE BABY
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00007	AND I'M ALSO VERY INTERESTED IN DESIGNING PINS FOR COWS TO HAVE BABIES AND TO DO THAT I LET THE COWS TELL ME WHAT THEY WANT SO I GIVE THEM AN ENVIRONMENT FOR INSTANCE THAT HAS
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00008	ONE VERY OPEN AREA AND ONE VERY CLOSED AREA AND LET THEM CHOOSE WHICH THEY PREFER TO CALVIN. THE RESEARCH I'M DOING AT THE CENTRE INVOLVES ASSESSING THE EMOTIONS OF DAIRY CATTLE.
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00009	THIS IS KIND OF A RECENT AREA OF RESEARCH IT INVOLVES A COGNITIVE BIAS TASK TO OBJECTIVELY MEASURE THE EMOTIONS OF THE ANIMALS
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00010	BUT THIS TYPE OF STUDY HAS NEVER BEEN DONE IN CATTLE BEFORE SO I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT IT. IT'S KIND OF A COMPLICATED EXPERIMENT BUT IT BASICALLY INVOLVES TRAINING ANIMALS IN A TASK
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00011	AND HOW THEY INTERPRET DIFFERENT COLORED SCREENS ENABLES ME TO ASSESS THEIR PESSIMISTIC OR OPTIMISTIC OUTLOOK ON LIFE
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00012	SO THE EXPERIMENT I JUST FINISHED RIGHT NOW WAS A DEHORNING TRIAL SO I LOOKED AT THEIR BASELINE EMOTIONS BEFORE DEHORNING AND AFTER DEHORNING I FOUND THAT DURING THE PAIN PHASE THEY EXHIBITED A MORE PESSIMISTIC
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00013	INTERPRETATIONS OF THESE SCREENS. SO MY NEXT PLAN IS TO USE THE SAME TRIAL TO LOOK AT THE EMOTIONS OF ANIMALS HOUSED SOCIALLY AND HOUSED ISOLATED.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00002	Okay, good afternoon. We're so excited to be standing here in front of you all today and have the opportunity to speak on a topic that we are all very passionate about. Today's presentation will be focusing on all things marketing, branding, and social media.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00003	THROUGHOUT THIS PRESENTATION WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT THE STRENGTH IN ALL OF OUR SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AND HOW IT ALL STARTS WITH ONE PURPOSE AND ONE MESSAGE ONE THAT WE ALL SHARE TO START OFF WE JUST WANTED TO INTRODUCE OURSELVES
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00004	SO I'LL GO FIRST MY NAME IS ISABELLA VOIT AND I'M THE NEW MARKETING MANAGER THIS YEAR
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00006	I'M ORIANA MENDEZ AND I'M THE MEMBERSHIP MANAGER
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00008	AND I'M ZACH ZELINAK AND I'M THE OPERATIONS MANAGER.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00010	I'M ZACH ZELENAK I'M THE OPERATIONS MANAGER SO I GUESS WE'LL GET RIGHT INTO IT. SO I GUESS WE'LL GET RIGHT INTO IT. SO I GUESS WE'LL GET RIGHT INTO IT. SO TODAY WE'LL BE GOING OVER A SO TODAY WE'LL BE GOING OVER A SO TODAY WE'LL BE GOING OVER A FEW DIFFERENT AREAS THAT HAVE FEW DIFFERENT AREAS THAT HAVE FEW DIFFERENT AREAS THAT HAVE CREATED STRONG IMPACTS FOR OUR CREATED STRONG IMPACTS FOR OUR CREATED STRONG IMPACTS FOR OUR ORGANIZATION AND THAT CAN BE ORGANIZATION AND THAT CAN BE ORGANIZATION AND THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED WITHIN PROGRAMS OF IMPLEMENTED WITHIN PROGRAMS OF IMPLEMENTED WITHIN PROGRAMS OF ANY SIZ
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00011	TODAY'S CONTENT INCLUDES HOW WE OPERATE, SOME BRANDING GUIDELINES, SOCIAL MEDIA REQUESTS, CALENDARS, ENGAGEMENT, CAMPAIGNS, MEMBER PRESENCE, PHOTO STYLE, AND RESOURCES.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00012	ALL FOLLOWED BY SOME KEY TAKEAWAYS TO BETTER YOUR PROGRAM'S MARKETING BRANDING AND SOCIAL MEDIA
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00014	AS A LARGE PROGRAM WE HAVE A MARKETING TEAM OF APPROXIMATELY 70 PEOPLE WITH THAT IN MIND MUCH OF WHAT WE DO CAN BE SCALED DOWN FOR PROGRAMS WITH AS LITTLE AS ONE PERSON MANAGING MARKETING
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00015	FOR OUR ORGANIZATION SPECIFICALLY MARKETING IS BROKEN DOWN UNDER OUR MARKETING MANAGER INTO THREE TEAMS PUBLIC RELATIONS MULTIMEDIA AND DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY EACH TEAM HAS SPECIFIC RESPONSIBILITIES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR THAT HELPS SUPPORT OUR MARKETING GOALS
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00017	EVERY YEAR OUR MARKETING TEAM DIRECTORS CREATE NEW BRANDING GUIDELINES THAT WILL BE USED FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR BRANDING GUIDELINES SERVE AS THE OFFICIAL PLACE FOR OUR MEMBERS TO REFERENCE WHEN THEY NEED CLARIFICATION ON ANYTHING SPECIFIC THAT ENCOMPASSES OUR BRAND
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00018	AND ALLOWS ANYONE WHO LOOKS AT OUR BRAND TO RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS DANCE MARATHON AT THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE ONE COHESIVE MESSAGE TO OUR COMMUNITY, WE INCLUDE A VISION STATEMENT, A MISSION STATEMENT, AND AN ABOUT US SECTION FOR ALL OF OUR DIRECTORS AND OUR ORGANIZATION TO USE.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00019	WE ALSO INCLUDE COLOR PALLETS FOR OUR CAMPAIGN FEED AS WELL AS OUR YEAR LONG COLORS WE DECIDE ON THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF FONDS THAT WE WILL USE ON ALL OUR GRAPHICS AND WE INCLUDE ALL OF OUR LOGOS THAT WE WILL USE ON ANY SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS AS WELL AS ON OUR GRAPHICS ON SOCIAL MEDIA
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00020	WE ALSO INCLUDE TERMINOLOGY STATEMENTS SO THAT ALL OF OUR TERMS STAY CONSISTENT AND CAPITALIZED WHEN NECESSARY
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00021	WE WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND CREATING A BRANDING GUIDELINE OF YOUR OWN AMONGST YOUR MARKETING TEAM IN ORDER TO GET EVERYONE ON THE SAME PAGE AND GIVE OTHER MEMBERS WITHIN YOUR ORGANIZATION SOMETHING TO REFER BACK TO WHEN THEY ARE CREATING CONTENT.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00022	IF YOU WOULD LIKE FOR US TO SEND YOU OUR BRANDING GUIDELINE WE ARE MORE THAN HAPPY TO SHARE OURS WITH YOU SO THAT YOU HAVE IT AS A REFERENCE
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00024	SO HERE YOU CAN SEE AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT SOME OF OUR BRANDING ELEMENTS LOOK LIKE IN ACTION FOR OUR CURRENT SUMMER CAMPAIGN FEED YOU WILL SEE THAT THE GRAPHICS INCLUDE ALL THE COLORS ON THE COLOR PALLET
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00026	AND ALL THE FONDS ARE THE SAME. YOU WILL ALSO NOTICE THAT OUR HIGHLIGHT COVERS MATCH. WE ALWAYS CHANGE THE COLORS OF THESE FOR EACH CAMPAIGN TO MAKE SURE IT STANDS OUT EVEN MORE.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00027	EVEN THOUGH THESE DETAILS MAY SEEM SMALL THEY MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE AND ALLOW OUR FEED TO REPRESENT A VERY COHESIVE MESSAGE
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00029	THROUGHOUT THE YEAR THERE ARE ENDLESS AMOUNTS OF EVENTS AND INFORMATION THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SHARE ON OUR SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS IN ORDER TO KEEP THIS ORGANIZED AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE INCLUDING EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00030	SHARE. WE DEVELOPED A SOCIAL MEDIA REQUEST FORM WHERE MEMBERS CAN FILL OUT A GOOGLE FORM AND TELL US WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO BE POSTED. ONCE THEY FILL IT OUT THE MARKETING TEAMS TAKE ALL THE INFORMATION THAT THEY GIVE US AND DECIDE WHAT OUR NEXT STEPS WILL BE MOVING FORWARD.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00031	ALL THE RESPONSES FROM THIS FORM ARE DIRECTLY LINKED TO A GOOGLE SHEET WHERE DESIGNERS WILL THEN GO IN AND CLAIM WHICH ONES THEY WANT TO DO AND THEN FROM THERE WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE ALL ADDED TO OUR SOCIAL MEDIA CALENDAR SO WE CAN POST IT ON TIME
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00033	SO TO EXPLAIN THIS PROCESS A LITTLE BIT FURTHER WE WANTED TO GIVE YOU A SCENARIO THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW TO APPROACH WHAT YOU ARE POSTING AND THE THOUGHT PROCESS BEHIND THAT DECISION
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00034	AN EXAMPLE OF A REQUEST WOULD BE THAT CAPTAIN APPLICATIONS ARE OPENING ON AUGUST 30TH EVERY TIME WE GET A REQUEST THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE ARE ASKING OURSELVES IN ORDER TO COME UP WITH THE BEST GAME PLAN ON HOW TO PROMOTE THIS
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00035	SO WHAT PLATFORMS WOULD YOU BE USING, HOW EARLY DO YOU NEED TO POST, DO YOU NEED TO POST REMINDERS, SHOULD THIS BE A GRAPHIC OR PHOTO. I REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO START THINKING ABOUT ALL OF YOUR POSTS WITH THESE SAME QUESTIONS IN MIND.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00036	REGARDLESS IF IT'S A LARGE REQUEST OR SMALL REQUEST IT'S STILL VERY VALUABLE TO GET CREATIVE AND TRYING TO THINK ABOUT REALLY THE BEST SOLUTION AND DEBATING WHAT IS BEST TO IMPORTANT WHAT IS BEST AND MOST IMPORTANT TO SHARE ON THAT SPECIFIC PLATFORM
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00038	AS ISABEL EXPLAINED MEMBERS ARE ABLE TO SUBMIT REQUESTS FOR DIFFERENT MARKETING NEEDS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00040	THESE ARE POPULATED INTO OUR SOCIAL MEDIA CALENDAR AND USED TO KEEP TRACK OF WHAT NEEDS TO BE COMPLETED AND WHEN THIS CALENDAR IS KEY TO HAVING AN ORGANIZED, COHESIVE MARKETING PLAN THROUGHOUT THE YEAR ON OUR CALENDAR IN PARTICULAR, WE SEPARATE EACH TAB BY MONTH AND COLOR COORDINATE BY DIFFERENT TYPE OF POST
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00041	WE HAVE ALSO FOUND SEPARATING LARGER CAMPAIGNS INTO OUR OWN CALENDARS TO BE EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00043	HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT THIS EXACTLY LOOKS LIKE ON THE SCREEN YOU WILL SEE OUR SOCIAL MEDIA CALENDAR FOR TRANSFORM TODAY OUR LARGEST FUNDRAISING PUSH OF THE FALL AS YOU CAN SEE WE BREAK DOWN LARGER CAMPAIGNS HOUR BY HOUR TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE STAYING ON TRACK WITH WHAT NEEDS TO BE POSTED
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00044	THIS CALENDAR IS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BETWEEN THE MARKETING REQUEST FORM AND THE MARKETING TEAMS THAT WERE DESCRIBED EARLIER EVEN IF YOUR PROGRAM DOES NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY FOR DIFFERENT TEAMS WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND UTILIZING THIS PROACTIVE CALENDAR STRUCTURE TO ALLEVIATE THE STRESS OF CONSTANTLY COMING UP WITH CONTENT AS IT IS NEEDED
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00046	I'M SURE EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM CAN RELATE TO HOW HARD IT IS TO INCREASE SOCIAL MEDIA ENGAGEMENT IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE STILL WORKING ON OURSELVES
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00047	HOWEVER WE WOULD STILL LIKE TO SHARE SOME OF OUR BEST PRACTICES FOR EACH PLATFORM AND BREAK DOWN WHAT WE THINK IS VALUABLE TO POST AND WHAT IS NOT.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00048	SO STARTING WITH INSTAGRAM POSTS WE HAVE FOUND THAT WE ALWAYS GET THE MOST LIKES AND COMMENTS WHEN WE POST SOMETHING THAT INCLUDES PHOTOS OF PEOPLE
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00049	AS FAR AS INSTAGRAM STORIES WE REALLY ONLY SHARE UPDATES, REMINDERS, UPCOMING EVENTS AND ANY EXTRA INFORMATION THAT COMES UP TO KEEP IT ORGANIZED ON ALL OF OUR HIGHLIGHTS.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00050	REPLY POSTS ARE USUALLY SUCCESSFUL AND WE'LL REPOST SOME OF THE RESPONSES TO MAKE MEMBERS FEEL RECOGNIZED
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00051	FACEBOOK IS DEFINITELY NOT WIDELY USED AS OFTEN FOR USERS IN OUR GENERATION HOWEVER WE STILL USE FACEBOOK ALBUMS AS A PLACE TO SHARE ALL OF OUR PHOTOS AS WELL AS FACEBOOK EVENTS TO PROMOTE UPCOMING EVENTS THAT MEMBERS CAN SHARE TO THEIR TIMELINE
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00053	FOR MORE FUN PRESENTS WE USE TIKTOK TO SHOWCASE THE PERSONALITIES OF OUR MEMBERS AND THE FUN THAT THEY ARE HAVING AT OUR EVENTS WE ALWAYS TRY TO SHARE THESE AS REELS ON INSTAGRAM EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T ALWAYS SHARE THEM DIRECTLY TO OUR FEED
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00054	BROADCAST.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00055	HOWEVER WE HAVE A LOT OF PASSIONATE WRITERS ON OUR TEAM THAT THEY ENJOY WRITING THESE WE REALLY ONLY SHARE THESE ON OUR WEBSITE AND INSTAGRAM STORIES FOR PARENTS AND NEW MEMBERS THAT MIGHT WANT TO READ THEM
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00056	LASTLY WE'RE FAIRLY NEW TO TWITTER BUT WE HAVE FOUND THAT A LOT OF SPONSORS AND LOCAL BUSINESSES IN OUR AREA INTERACT WITH US STILL ON THERE SO WE ALWAYS TRY TO UPDATE IT WHEN WE CAN
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00058	SO WE EXECUTE SEVERAL CAMPAIGNS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS WELL AS OUR YEAR LONG CAMPAIGN THAT MOST OF OUR MESSAGING FOR THE YEAR WILL REVOLVE AROUND WHILE THESE ARE IMPLEMENTED TO STRATEGICALLY HELP WITH FUNDRAISING THE ANTICIPATION AND EXCITEMENT THAT COMES WITH THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF EACH CAMPAIGN
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00059	AND THE HASHTAG THAT WE RELEASE WITH THE VIDEO ALSO INSPIRES OUR MEMBERS AND GETS THEM LOOKING FORWARD TO WHAT IS TO COME.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00060	LAST YEAR OURS WAS CHOOSE CHANGE WITH THE IDEA THAT WE WERE WILLING TO ADAPT TO CHANGE AFTER THE PREVIOUS TWO YEARS OF COVID AND A COMPLETE SHIFT IN THE WAY WE RAN OUR EVENTS.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00061	THIS WAS VERY POWERFUL AND EVERY YEAR WE TRY TO COME UP WITH A RELEVANT MESSAGE THAT PEOPLE WILL RELATE AND CONNECT WITH
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00063	IN ORDER TO MAKE THESE STAND OUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA WE TRY TO UTILIZE CONNECTIVE FEED AS WELL AS THE NEW PINNED POST FEATURE.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00065	SO HERE ARE TWO EXAMPLES OF CAMPAIGN FACEBOOK BANNERS WE UPDATE OUR FACEBOOK COVER PHOTOS FOR EACH CAMPAIGN AND ENCOURAGE ALL OF OUR MEMBERS TO UPDATE THEIR OWN PERSONAL ONES AS WELL WITH THE SAME ONE WE CREATE
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00066	ONE SIMPLE COVER PHOTO CHANGE LEADS TO MORE PROFILE CLICKS AND MORE QUESTIONS ASKED ABOUT WHAT WE DO BECAUSE COVER PHOTOS ALWAYS SHOW UP ON OUR TIMELINE AND FEED WE ALWAYS USE HASHTAGS FOR OURS JUST BECAUSE IT ADDS THAT EXTRA PUSH OF ENGAGEMENT
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00067	AND MAKES IT FEEL MORE OFFICIAL. AGAIN, THESE ALL MATCH THE COLOR PELLET FOR THAT TIME AND UPDATE OFTEN.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00069	CONNECTIVE FEED IS A REALLY AWESOME DESIGN TACTIC THAT WE STRIVE TO IMPLEMENT FOR DIFFERENT CAMPAIGNS. THIS MAKES IT EASY TO LOOK AT THE FEED AND KNOW IMMEDIATELY WHERE THE CERTAIN CAMPAIGN STARTS AND ENDS.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00070	MAKING THE FEED CONNECT IS NOT TOO CHALLENGING AS LONG AS YOU PLAN IT OUT IN ADVANCE WHAT AND KNOW WHAT YOUR NEXT 12 POSTS WILL BE SO YOU CAN DESIGN ACCORDINGLY TO MAKE IT WORK THE HARDEST PART IS COMING UP WITH THE DESIGN ITSELF AND MAKING SURE THAT YOU'RE POSTING IN THE RIGHT ORDER
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00071	HERE YOU CAN SEE OUR CONNECTIVE FEED THROUGHOUT OUR SEASON OF MIRACLES CAMPAIGN YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DO THIS FOR EVERY CAMPAIGN BUT DEFINITELY SOMETHING WORTH TRYING WHEN YOU CAN
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00073	DO THIS FOR EVERY CAMPAIGN BUT DEFINITELY SOMETHING WORTH TRYING WHEN YOU CAN DO THIS FOR EVERY CAMPAIGN BUT DEFINITELY SOMETHING WORTH TRYING WHEN YOU CAN DO THIS FOR EVERY CAMPAIGN BUT DEFINITELY SOMETHING WORTH TRYING WHEN YOU CAN DO THIS FOR EVERY CAMPAIGN BUT DEFINITELY SOMETHING WORTH TRYING WHEN YOU CAN DO THIS FOR EVERY CAMPAIGN BUT DEFINITELY SOMETHING WORTH TRYING WHEN YOU CAN DO THIS FOR EVERY CAMPAIGN BUT DEFINITELY SOMETHING WORTH TRYING WHEN YOU CAN DO THIS FOR EVERY CAMPAIGN BUT DEFINITELY SOMETHING WORTH TRYING WHEN YOU CAN DO THIS FOR EVERY CAMPAIGN BUT DEFINITELY SOMETHING WORTH TRYING WHEN YOU CAN DO THIS FOR EVERY CAMPAIGN BUT
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00074	AND WE FACILITATE PROFESSIONAL HEADSHOTS TO GIVE OUR MEMBERS ANOTHER ELEMENT OF COMMUNITY AND ORGANIZATION PRESENCE YEAR-LONG DURING STARTING CAMPAIGNS WE ALSO DEVELOP FACEBOOK BANNERS AS AN EASY WAY TO BOOST AWARENESS
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00075	IF YOUR ORGANIZATION HAS TEAMS WE ALSO FIND THAT TEAM INSTAGRAM SUPPORT RECRUITMENT EFFORTS AND INCREASE A SENSE OF COMMUNITY ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOT OFFICIALLY AFFILIATED WITH OUR MARKETING THEY ARE A FUN ADDITION THAT LEADERSHIP THAT OTHER LEADERSHIP CAN FACILITATE
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00076	FOR EXAMPLE OUR SPONSORSHIPS TEAM RUNS SPONSORSHIPS INSTAGRAM
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00078	HERE YOU CAN SEE AN EXAMPLE OF THE PROFESSIONAL HEADSHOTS I MENTIONED EARLIER COLORED POLOS SIGNIFY YOUR TEAM AFFILIATION FOR EXAMPLE OUR LEADERSHIP TEAM BOSTS A WHITE POLO EACH YEAR SHOWN ON THE LEFT WHILE OUR FUNCTIONAL TEAMS GET A NEW COLOR EACH YEAR
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00079	I WAS ON MERCHANDISE LAST YEAR AND WE HAD LIME GREEN POLOS ISABELLA WAS ON PUBLIC RELATIONS LAST YEAR AND THEY HAD LIGHT PINK POLOS THE COMBINATION OF PROFESSIONAL HEADSHOTS AND POLOS ELEVATES OUR MARKETING PRESENCE YEAR LONG
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00081	CAMPAIGN LAST YEAR WAS CHOOSE CHANGE.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00082	AS AN ELEMENT OF THIS OUR MARKETING TEAM DEVELOPS TEAM SPECIFIC BANNERS THAT GAVE MEMBERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THEIR MERIT THEIR PAIRED MIRACLE CHILD STORY ON SOCIAL MEDIA
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00083	THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO USE MARKETING TO BOOST AWARENESS FOR OUR CAUSE IN A NEW WAY
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00085	OUR GREATEST ADVICE WHEN IT COMES TO PHOTOS IS TO CAPTURE MOMENTS OUR GOAL HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO POST PHOTOS THAT STRIKE A MEMORY OR ALLOW YOU TO ENVISION THE EMOTIONS THAT ARE OCCURRING WITHIN IT
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00086	CANDID PHOTOS ARE ALWAYS BEST WHEN TRYING TO CAPTURE THOSE MOMENTS AND EMOTIONS RATHER THAN JUST POST PHOTOS YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT KIND OF PHOTO YOU MIGHT NEED SO WE ALWAYS ENCOURAGE OUR PHOTOGRAPHERS TO TAKE PHOTOS OF ANYONE AND EVERYONE
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00087	AGAIN FOR BRANDING PURPOSES WE PUT THE SAME PRESET AND LOGO ON OUR PHOTOS EVERY SINGLE TIME SO THAT WHEN WE SHARE THEM PEOPLE WILL KNOW IMMEDIATELY THAT IT IS DMEUF
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00089	RGARDLESS OF HOW LARGE YOUR PROGRAM IS AND THE AMOUNT OF REQUESTS YOU GET THROUGHOUT THE YEAR BEING ORGANIZED IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00090	I HIGHLY RECOMMEND USING A PLATFORM THAT IS FREE SUCH AS GOOGLE DRIVE FOR ALL OF YOUR CALENDARS, ASSIGNMENTS, FORMS, PHOTOS, GRAPHICS, REALLY ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN THINK OF TO KEEP IT ALL IN ONE PLACE.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00091	WE PERSONALLY USE ADOBE SUITE FOR ALL OF OUR DESIGNS HOWEVER YOU CAN USE A FREE PLATFORM LIKE CANVA THAT WILL STILL ALLOW YOU TO CREATE COLOR PALLETS LOGOS FONTS REALLY ALL THE SAME THINGS THAT WE DO IN ADOBE
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00092	ANY APPS THAT YOU WANT TO USE TO PLAN OUT YOUR FEED AHEAD OF TIME I WOULD RECOMMEND USING PREVIEW UNFOLD OR TEZA
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00094	WHILE WE HAVE GIVEN YOU A LOT OF INFORMATION TODAY I JUST WANT YOU TO REMEMBER THAT WE ALL SHARE THE SAME CAUSE AND THAT THERE IS BEAUTY IN THE POWER THAT WE HAVE TO SHARE OUR PASSION WITH OTHERS
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00095	MY GREATEST RECOMMENDATION FOR YOU ALL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR MESSAGING IS ALWAYS CONSISTENT USE YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA TO GET YOUR MEMBERS FEELING VALUED AND RECOGNIZED
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00096	GET CREATIVE TO MAKE PEOPLE WANT TO ENGAGE WITH YOU AND CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO GROW ON EACH OF YOUR ACTIVE PLATFORMS
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00098	THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME TODAY WE REALLY LOVED GETTING TO SPEAK TO YOU ALL PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CONTACT US WITH THE EMAILS LISTED BELOW IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE ANY MORE OF OUR MARKETING MATERIALS AND AT THIS TIME WE WOULD LIKE TO OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00001	So next I will introduce the next speaker, Endang Wahayu.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00003	AND
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00004	Bye.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00005	for you
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00006	Good morning, good day, good afternoon, everybody. I'm happy to see you all.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00008	OKAY SPECIAL THANKS FOR IBU SAFARINA FOR GIVING ME OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR LISTS ACTIVITY
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00009	TO SHARE OUR RESEARCH ACTIVITY TO SHARE OUR RESEARCH ACTIVITY TO SHARE OUR RESEARCH ACTIVITY TO SHARE OUR RESEARCH ACTIVITY TO SHARE OUR RESEARCH ACTIVITY TO SHARE OUR RESEARCH ACTIVITY TO SHARE OUR RESEARCH ACTIVITY TO SHARE OUR RESEARCH ACTIVITY TO SHARE OUR RESEARCH ACTIVITY TO SHARE OUR RESEARCH ACTIVITY TO SHARE OUR RESEARCH ACTIVITY TO SHARE OUR RESEARCH ACTIVITY TO SHARE OUR RESEARCH ACTIVITY TO SHARE OUR RESEARCH ACTIVITY TO SHARE OUR RESEARCH ACTIVITY TO SHARE OUR RESEARCH ACTIVITY TO SHARE OUR RESEARCH ACTIVITY TO SHARE OUR RESEARCH ACTIVITY TO SHARE OUR RESEARCH
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00011	MALNUTRITION AND METABOLIC DISORDER.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00013	CONTENT OF MY PRESENTATION RELATED WITH THE MICROBIOTA OF INDONESIAN POPULATION FROM INFANT TO ELDERLY BASED ON OUR GROUP STUDY.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00014	AND THEN SOME RESULT ON A GUT MICROBIOTA OF METABOLIC DISORDER RESPONDENTS PARTICULARLY FOR OBESITY AND TYPE 2 DIABETES SUBJECTS.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00015	AND ALSO I WILL ALSO FOCUSED ON A GUT MICROBIOTA OF MALNUTRITION CHILDREN. HOWEVER, OUR SAMPLE IS VERY LIMITED.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00016	BECAUSE WE CONDUCT RESEARCH WITH A SAMPLE FROM CUKCAKARTA AND BALI AND ALSO LOMBO IT'S VERY LIMITED COMPARED TO INDONESIA VERY VERY HUGE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00018	SO BEFORE I START TO THE TOPIC I WOULD LIKE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00020	TO GIVE SOME INTRODUCTION ABOUT OUR RESEARCH GROUP AT UNIVERSITAS GAJAHMADA
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00022	WE STARTED RESEARCH ON ISOLATION OF LACTIC ACID BACTERIA FROM TRADITIONAL FERMENTED FOOD AND OTHER SOURCES SINCE 1991 UP TO NOW.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00023	AND WE GOT HUNDREDS OF ISOLATES WHICH WERE THEN STORED IN AMPULE AT THE FOOD AND NUTRITION CULTURE COLLECTION.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00025	IN EARLY
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00027	YEAR OF 2000.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00029	WE STARTED SCREENING OUR ISOLITES WITH POTENTIAL SUB PROBIOTIC CANDIDATES. CURRENTLY WE HAVE SEVERAL STRENGTH PROBIOTIC
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00030	WE HAVE ALSO CONDUCTED HUMAN CLINICAL TRIAL ON THE HEALTH BENEFIT OF OUR INDIGENOUS PROBIOTIC WHICH INVOLVED GUT MICROBIOTA ANALYSIS.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00031	SO THAT'S WHY OUR GUT MICROBIOTA STUDY ACTUALLY START FROM THE CLINICAL TRIALS OF PROBIOTIC
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00033	SO WE ARE ALSO INVOLVED IN ANCIENT MICROBIOME PROJECT LEAD BY PROF. JUAN KUNLI SINCE 2008 UP TO NOW. AFTER TWO YEARS,
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00034	NOW OUR UH UNIVERSITY STATED AS UH UNIVERSITY CENTER FOR EXCELLENCY FOR PROBIOTIC STUDIES
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00035	BECAUSE OUR CONSISTENT RESEARCH RELATED TO PROBIOTIC
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00037	SO
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00039	this picture mentioning about
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00041	CUT MICROBIOTA FROM INFANT SCHOOL AID CHILDREN IS THE RESULT OF IMP 1 AND 3 OR 4 I DIDN'T REMEMBER
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00042	AND ALSO CUT MICROBIOTA OF AH ADULT AND ELDERLY BASED ON OUR OWN STUDY
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00043	WE CAN SEE HERE IN THE PICTURE HERE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00044	.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00045	This is showing the top 30 genera of microbial
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00047	FACAL MICROBIOL OF BABY YEAH AND WE CAN SEE HERE START FROM UH ONE MONTH THREE MONTH SIX MONTH 12 MONTH AND MORE THAN 12 MONTH
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00049	ABOUT UP TO TWO YEARS WE CAN SEE HERE DOMINANCY OF MICROBIOTA IN FACAL BABY ARE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00051	BIFIDOBACTERIUM AND ALSO BACTERIOITES
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00053	AND THIS IS VERY MUCH DIFFERENT IF WE COMPARE TO GUT MICROBIOTA OF THE MOTHER.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00054	BUT AFTER TWO YEARS WE CAN SEE HERE THE PROFILE OF MICROBIOTA OF CHILDREN RESEMBLE TO THE MOTHER.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00055	SO WE CAN SEE HERE WE CAN CONCLUDE THAT INDONESIAN INFANT HAVE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00056	BACTEROIDIS AND BIFIDOBACTERIUM ENTEROTYPE WHILE START FROM SCHOOL AIDES AND THEN ADULT AND ELDERLY THEY HAVE PREFOTELLA ENTEROTYPE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00057	AND ACCORDING TO OUR RESEARCH FOR ELDERLY WHO LIVE IN CHUCHAKARTA AND ALSO AT THE BALI THEIR BIFIDOBACTERIUM
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00059	TEND TO DECREASE WHILE THE ENTEROBACTERIUM TEND TO INCREASE.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00061	OKAY.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00063	Here is a picture.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00065	IS A PICTURE WHEN IS A PICTURE WHEN WE IS A PICTURE WHEN WE GET IS A PICTURE WHEN WE GET A IS A PICTURE WHEN WE GET A SAMPLE IS A PICTURE WHEN WE GET A SAMPLE FROM IS A PICTURE WHEN WE GET A SAMPLE FROM ELDERY IS A PICTURE WHEN WE GET A SAMPLE FROM ELDERY AT IS A PICTURE WHEN WE GET A SAMPLE FROM ELDERY AT PALI IS A PICTURE WHEN WE GET A SAMPLE FROM ELDERY AT PALI IN IS A PICTURE WHEN WE GET A SAMPLE FROM ELDERY AT PALI IN THE FROM ELDERY AT PALI IN THE FROM ELDERY AT PALI IN THE YEAR FROM ELDERY AT PALI IN THE YEAR OF FROM ELDERY AT PALI IN THE YEAR OF FROM ELDERY AT PALI IN THE YEAR OF 2016, FROM ELDER
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00066	WE MUST PATIENT INTERVIEWING THE ELDERLY HERE ASKING ABOUT THE DAILY DIET AND ALSO HEALTH CONDITION INCLUDING THE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00067	AND WE ALSO HAVE TO BE PATIENT TO WITH THEIR PHYSES SOMETIMES START FROM EARLY IN THE MORNING
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00068	AND WE COMPILED THE FAECES HERE AND PUT IT IN COLD CONDITION
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00070	AND THEN WE PUT IN OUR LUGGAGE IN THIS PICTURE, WE APPRECIATE TO ALL RESOURCE WHO INVOLVE, WHO PARTICIPATE IN COLLECTING FACAL SAMPLES.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00071	WE JUST LIKE TOURISTS WITH A LOT OF LUGGAGE HERE YEAH WE HAVE TO BRING FROM UH DEN PASAR TO OUR CITY JUKJAKARTA YEAH A LOT OF LUGGAGE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00072	BECAUSE WE BRING COLD BOX INCLUDING FECAL MATERIALS INSIDE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00074	SO
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00076	This figure show the relationship between gut microbiota and other organ. Such brain here.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00077	AND ALSO KIDNEY AND EVEN LUNG.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00078	WE KNOW WELL THE TERMS GUT MICROBIOTA, BRAIN EXIST SEVERAL IMPORTANT GUT MICROBIOTA METABOLISTS LIKE HERE WE SEE SHORT-SINFETIACID
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00079	AND PEPTIDE YEAH BIOACTIVE PEPTIDE INCLUDING GAPA PLAY RULE AS A NEUROTRANSMITTER
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00081	.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00083	MICROBIOTA IS DISRUPTED BY SEVERAL FACTORS SUCH AS ANTIBIOTIC TREATMENT, FOODBORN PATHOGEN,
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00084	EVEN COVID-19 VIRUS AS WELL AS UNHEALTHY LIFE DISBIOSIS OCCURS
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00086	ACCORDING TO OUR STUDIES, DYSBIOSIS OCCUR IN MALNUTRITION OR STUNTING CHILDREN, METABOLIC DISORDER PERSON LIKE OBESITY AND DIABETIC TYPE 2,
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00087	AND NOW WE ALSO LEARN THE DYSBIOSIS IN NAFALDI PATIENT INCLUDING GASTROENTERITIS AOSINOPHILIC YEAH
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00088	AT THE MOMENT WE CONDUCTED THE GUT MICROBIODITA
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00090	.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00092	OKAY.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00094	Some of our publication, it's in our website.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00095	PROVENTLY I AM A DISMARKING ALSO ALREADY MENTIONED ABOUT THE CORRELATION BETWEEN CONSUMPTION OF
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00096	HIGH CARBOHYDRATE HERE RELATED WITH THE DOMINANCY OF ROMINO COCASSE AND ALSO BACTERIOIDES IN THE DIABETIC TYPE TWO PERSONS
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00098	WHILE CONSUMPTION OF FAT CAUSED INCREASING OF ROBOTIA RELATED
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00099	ALSO WITH PROFITILA THIS IS A CURSE IN THE OBESITY PERSON
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00101	THIS IS A PUBLICATION RELATED TO THE AMP PROJECT
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00103	A PUBLICATION RELATED TO THE I M PROJECT SO A PUBLICATION RELATED TO THE I M PROJECT SO A
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00105	We can see here, this is a report of government in 2021 in Indonesia still facing problem.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00106	ON A PREVALENT THIS IS A PREVALENCY OF STUNTING INDONESIA STILL FACING PROBLEM ON THIS STUNTING SOME EVEN THE COLOR IT'S BLACK BLACK
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00107	THIS IS A BIG BLACK YEAH AND THIS IS A BIG BLACK YEAH AND IN THIS IS A BIG BLACK YEAH AND IN FACT THIS IS A BIG BLACK YEAH AND IN FACT
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00108	WE SELECT ONLY TWO AREAS.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00110	FOR STUDY THE MICROBIODITA OF STUNTING OR UNDERNUTRITION THE CHILDREN AT JUKCEKATA HERE IN JAWA.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00111	AND ALSO AT LOMBO LOMBO IT'S REALLY RED COLOR MEAN THE IN THIS AREA UH PROBLEMS STUNTING IT'S MORE SERIOUS YEAH COMPARED TO OTHER PLACES WITH UH YELLOW OR GREEN COLOR
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00113	OKAY UH THIS IS STUDY ON A GUT MICROBIOTA OF NORMAL AND UNDERNUTRITION
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00115	CHILDREN WITH THE AIDES OF THREE TO FIVE YEARS THE LOCATION OF THE SUBJECT IS FROM CHUKCEKARTA
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00116	THE NUMBER OF SUBJECTS ABOUT UH 28 THE CHILDREN WE CONDUCTED THIS RESEARCH DURING PANDEMIC
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00117	SO IT'S DIFFICULT FOR US TO GET A MORE UH SUBJECT FOR THIS STUDY WE CAN SEE HERE ABOUT THE FOOD CONSUMPTION
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00118	ACTUALLY THIS RESEARCH CONDUCTED IN THE AREA WITH THE SOCIAL AND ALSO IN ECONOMICALLY SIMILAR
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00119	. SO I MEAN THE INCOME OF THE PARENTS ARE SIMILAR, BUT DIFFERENT IS THE DIET FOR THEIR CHILDREN.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00120	WE CAN SEE HERE YEAH UNDER MALNUTRIENT UNDER NUTRITION CHILDREN CONSUME SNACK AND SWEET MUCH YEAH MUCH MORE COMPARED TO THE NORMAL CHILDREN RIGHT
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00121	AND HERE SEEM THAT SWEET AND SNACK MAYBE GIVE WHAT YOU CALL IT YEAH EFFECT TO THE REGULAR MEALS
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00122	SO THAT'S WHY MAYBE CHILDREN DOESN'T WANT TO EAT THE REGULAR MEAL BECAUSE THEY PREFER SNACK AND SWEET AND ACCORDING TO OUR DATA WE CAN SEE HERE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00124	THE DIFFERENCES OF THIS DIET YEAH GIVE ALSO THIS BIOSIS WE CAN SEE HERE THE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00126	PROPORTION FIRMICUTE AND COMPARED TO PROPORTION OF FIRMICUTE AND BACTEROIDIS INCREASE WHILE PROTEOBACTERIA HIGHER
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00127	AND ACTINOBACTERIA LOWER
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00129	AND THIS ALSO EFFECTS THE SHORT-CHAIN FETIACID BETWEEN THESE TWO GROUPS. WE CAN SEE HERE THE PROPIONIC ACID AND BUTYRIC ACID IS MUCH LOWER.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00130	IN THE MALNUTRITION CHILDREN WHILE THE P-8 IT'S HIGHER HERE THE P-8 IT'S HIGHER IN THE MALNUTRITION CHILDREN WE CAN UNDERSTAND DURING THE DISBIOSIS
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00131	WHEN THE MANY BACTERIA CHANGING WHEN THE MANY BACTERIA CHANGING YEAH IN HERE PARTICULARLY WE KNOW THAT YEAH IN HERE PARTICULARLY WE KNOW THAT PROTEOBACTERIA CONSISTS OF PROTEOBACTERIA CONSISTS OF SEVERAL PATHOGENIC BACTERIA
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00132	AND ACTIVITY BACTERIA HERE IT'S UH LIKE BIVIDOBACTERIA UH THE EXAMPLE IT'S A BIVIDOBACTERIA BECOMING LOWER YEAH WE UNDERSTAND THE SHORTEN FATTY ACID HERE IT'S DECREASING
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00133	IN THE MALNUTRITION CHILDREN THERE ARE ALSO UH OVER EXPRESSION YES GENERAL OF METHANOPRIVYBACTER ANAROCOCUS UBACTERIUM AND ALSO SUXINIC FIBRIO SUXINIC FIBRIO WE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00134	HAVE PUBLISHED ALREADY THIS LAST TWO YEARS
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00135	AND THE NEXT WE COMPILED YEAH WE COMPILED FACULT SAMPLES FROM UNDERNUTRIENT WITH THE LOCATION AT LOMBO
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00136	WITH MORE SEVERE COMPARE TO CHUKCHAKARTA UH THE AIDS YEAH CHUKCHAKARTA WE CONDUCT UH CUT MICROBIOTA THREE TO FIVE YEAR OLDS IN LOMBOK
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00137	WE CONDUCT THE NINE TO ELEVEN YEARS OLD CHILDREN YEAH HERE'S SOME PICTURE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00138	WHEN WE GIVE INFORMATION ABOUT SOME DOCUMENT THAT MUST BE FILLED OUT YEAH LIKE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00140	INFORMATION YEAH ABOUT UH INFORMATION YEAH ABOUT UH INFORMATION YEAH ABOUT UH INFORMATION YEAH ABOUT UH INFORMATION YEAH ABOUT UH INFORMATION YEAH ABOUT UH INFORMATION YEAH ABOUT UH INFORMATION YEAH ABOUT UH INFORMATION YEAH ABOUT UH INFORMATION YEAH ABOUT UH INFORMATION YEAH ABOUT UH INFORMATION YEAH ABOUT UH INFORMATION YEAH ABOUT UH INFORMATION YEAH ABOUT UH INFORMATION YEAH ABOUT UH INFORMATION YEAH ABOUT UH INFORMATION YEAH ABOUT UH INFORMATION YEAH ABOUT UH INFORMATION YEAH ABOUT UH INFORMATION YEAH ABOUT UH INFORMATION YEAH ABOUT UH INFORMATION YEAH ABOUT UH INFORMATION YEAH ABOUT UH INFORMATION YEAH ABOUT UH INFORMATION YEAH ABOUT UH INFORMATION YEAH ABOUT UH INFORMATION YEAH ABOUT UH INFORMATION YEAH ABOUT UH INFORMATION YEAH ABOUT UH INFORMATION YEAH ABOUT UH INFORMATION YEAH ABOUT UH INFORMATION YEAH ABOUT UH
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00141	AND ALSO THE OTHER QUESTIONNAIRE YEAH AND THEN WE GIVE THEM THE COAL BOX YEAH AND THEN WE GIVE THEM THE COAL BOX YEAH AND THEN WE GIVE THEM THE COAL BOX YEAH AND THEN THE CHILDREN
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00142	YOU HAVE ONE MORE MINUTE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00143	YEAH, OKAY THANK YOU YEAH THE CHILDREN WILL BRING IT TO THEIR HOME AND GIVE THIS TO US IN THE MORNING THE FOLLOWING DAY
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00144	OKAY THE VERY IMPORTANT YEAH THIS ONE WE CAN SEE THE DETERIORATIVE INTAKE IT'S REALLY LOWER FOR THE UNDERNUTRITION STUDENTS UNDERNUTRITION CHILDREN
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00145	AND ALSO WE CAN SEE HERE SOME YEAH MANY FIVE AMONG SIX YEAH FILM
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00146	ALSO DIFFERENT SIGNIFICANTLY AND HERE I CAN SEE BIFIDOBACTERIUM IT'S VERY VERY LOWER IN
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00147	AND HERE YOU I CAN SEE BIFIDOBACTERIUM IS VERY VERY LOWER IN UH UNDERNUTRITION CHILDREN WHILE UNDERNUTRITION CHILDREN WHILE UNDERNUTRITION CHILDREN WHILE ACERMANCIA IT'S HIGHER THIS IS VERY ACERMANCIA IT'S HIGHER THIS IS VERY
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00148	WE THINK THAT AKKERMANSIA BECOMING DOMINANT BECAUSE NO NUTRITION FOR OTHER MICROORGANISMS SO THE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00149	AKKERMANSIA THEY HAVE AKKERMANSIA MUSINIFILA THEY HAVE MUSIN DEGRADING ENZYMES
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00150	THAT HAVE UH AKKERMANSIA THAT HAVE UH MUCIN DEGRADING ENZYMES THEY THAT HAVE UH MUCIN DEGRADING ENZYMES THEY HAVE THAT HAVE UH MUCIN DEGRADING ENZYMES THEY HAVE OPPORTUNITY THAT HAVE UH MUCIN DEGRADING ENZYMES THEY HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO THAT HAVE UH MUCIN DEGRADING ENZYMES THEY HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME THEY HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME THEY HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME DOMINANT THEY HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME DOMINANT IN THEY HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME DOMINANT IN THIS DOMINANT IN THIS DOMINANT IN THIS UNDERDOWN DOMINANT IN THIS UNDERNUTRITION DOMINANT IN THIS UNDERNUTRITION GROUP.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00151	OKAY AND SINCE OUR RESEARCH ACTUALLY RELATED WITH PROBIOTIC WE HAVE SEVERAL STUDY ON INTERVENTION OF LOCAL PROBIOTIC
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00152	AND ALSO THEIR GUT MICROBIOTA AFTER INTERVENTION ON OVERWEIGHT ADULTS AND ALSO DIABETIC WOMEN INCLUDING NAFALDI
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00153	AND ALSO GASTRO ENTEROTYPIC PATIENT. SOME WE ALREADY PUBLISHED AND THEN SOME WE STILL CONDUCT THE RESEARCH THAT STILL GOING ON.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00154	OKAY TAKE HOME MESSAGE MORPHICAL SAMPLES NEEDED FROM DIFFERENT TRIBES AND PLACES INCLUDING HEALTH STATUS OF INDONESIA
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00155	FOR OBTAINING REAL PICTURE OF INDONESIAN CUT MICROBIOTA AND THEIR CORRELATION WITH THE HEALTH CONDITION OF COURSE COLLABORATION WITH ALL PARTNERS IS NEEDED YEAH
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00156	THIS IS OUR TEAM AND HAPPY TO MENTION ABOUT OUR WEBSITE HERE WE CONDUCT A TRAINING COURSE ON GUT MICROBIOTA ANALYSIS
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00157	AND ALSO ANALYSIS OF GUT MICROBIOTA PARTICULARLY FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS AND ALSO WE CONDUCT CLINICAL TRIAL FOR INDUSTRY RELATED TO PROBIOTIC AND GUT MICROBIOTA
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00158	.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00160	LIKE TO STOP OKAY
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00161	YEAH THANK YOU
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00002	Hi, everyone. My name is Lindsay Wilson, and I'm the executive director of Dance Marathon at Florida State University.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00003	AND I'M SUPER EXCITED TO BE SPEAKING WITH YOU TODAY ABOUT HOW YOU CAN LOOK AT YOUR DATA TO MAKE DATA-BASED DECISIONS DURING YOUR FUNDRAISING PUSHES
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00005	FIRST, I WANT TO GIVE A QUICK OVERVIEW OF THE TOPIC THAT WE'LL BE DISCUSSING TODAY THE FIRST PART OF THIS PRESENTATION WILL OUTLINE IMPORTANT DATA POINTS THAT YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING AT DURING YOUR FUNDRAISING PUSHES
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00007	I'LL COVER THE IMPORTANCE OF LOOKING AT THIS DATA CRITICALLY AND EXACTLY WHAT DATA POINTS THAT YOU CAN ANALYZE ADDITIONALLY I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT OUR YEAR-OVER-YEAR DATA
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00008	AND HOW YOU CAN USE THIS TO MAKE DATA BASED DECISIONS WITHIN YOUR PROGRAM WHETHER IT'S DURING YOUR MARATHON OR WHETHER A FUNDRAISING PUSH EVENT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO DO THAT
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00009	I'LL INCLUDE SOME EXAMPLES OF LOOKING AT THIS DATA AND HOW OUR PROGRAM AT TMI FSU FORMATS OUR TRACKING DOCUMENTS TO BEST VIEW THIS DATA
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00010	AT THE END, I ALSO HAVE AN EXAMPLE TRACKING DOCUMENT AND IF NEEDED, YOU CAN CONTACT ME FOR THAT AS WELL. THE SECOND PART OF THIS PRESENTATION WILL BE ABOUT USING THAT DATA TO MAKE DECISIONS DURING YOUR FUNDRAISING PUSHES.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00011	HOW TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THAT YOU'RE SEEING OR EVEN HOW TO APPROACH THE POSITIVE DATA THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00012	DURING THIS PART OF THE PRESENTATION, I'LL ALSO COVER DIFFERENT WAYS THAT YOU CAN IMPROVE OR INCENTIVIZE YOUR FUNDRAISING IN THE MOMENT, EVEN IF IT'S RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR MAIN EVENT.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00014	LOOKING AT YOUR DATA CAN BE EXTREMELY BENEFICIAL FOR EVERY PROGRAM BUT I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT SOMETIMES IT CAN BE EXTREMELY OVERWHELMING.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00015	HOWEVER, IF YOU'RE ABLE TO SEE THIS DATA DURING YOUR FUNDRAISING INITIATIVES, YOU'RE ABLE TO PINPOINT WHO'S EXCELLING AND WHO'S FALLING BEHIND. SO THAT'S A HUGE BENEFIT OF LOOKING AT YOUR DATA.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00016	THIS ALLOWS YOU TO BE REALLY PROACTIVE ABOUT SOLUTIONS AND THE WAY THAT YOU RESPOND TO YOUR DATA ANALYSIS AS LONG AS YOU'RE ABLE TO PULL THIS DATA BEFOREHAND
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00018	IF YOU DO HAVE THIS DATA ACCESSIBLE BEFORE YOUR FUNDRAISING PUSHES AND YOUR PROCESS IS A LITTLE BIT MORE AUTOMATED, AS I'LL SHOW YOU IN A LITTLE BIT,
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00019	LATER. YOU MAY BE ABLE TO LOOK AT YOUR DATA TO MAKE BETTER DECISIONS ON HOW TO TARGET SPECIFIC AREAS THAT YOU MAY NEED TO IMPROVE IN FOR FUNDRAISING OR EVEN ENGAGEMENT WITHIN YOUR ORGANIZATION.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00020	. SOME IMPORTANT DATA POINTS THAT WE LOOK AT SPECIFICALLY AT FSU ARE OUR ACTIVE FUNDRAISERS THAT'S BROKEN DOWN BY POSITION.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00021	BREAKDOWNS IN THAT INCOME, INTERNAL TEAMS YEAR OVER YEAR, OUR EXTERNAL TEAMS YEAR OVER YEAR, AND OUR K-12 PROGRAMS YEAR OVER YEAR DATA. I'LL GO INTO THIS A LITTLE BIT MORE INTO DETAIL WITH SOME EXAMPLES ON THE NEXT SLIDE.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00023	NOW THESE SCREEN SHOTS ARE FROM OUR TRACKING DOCUMENT THAT WE CREATED FOR OUR MAIN EFFECT LAST YEAR THESE ARE JUST SOME EXAMPLES OF WHAT OUR DOCUMENTS LOOK LIKE TO ANALYZE OUR DATA DEPENDING ON HOW WE LOOK WANT TO LOOK AT IT
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00024	AS YOU CAN SEE AT THE TOP WE CAN INPUT A SPECIFIC TIME AND OUR NUMBERS THROUGHOUT THE DOCUMENT WILL AUTO ADJUST TO GIVE US AN IDEA OF WHERE OUR NUMBERS WERE AT COMPARED TO THE LAST FEW YEARS
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00026	WE'RE ABLE TO QUICKLY SEE THIS DATA AND COMPARE IT IN ORDER TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT AREAS WE MAY NEED TO TARGET FOR IMPROVEMENT OR AREAS THAT WE MAY NEED TO LOOK AT AND USE THAT TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS IN OTHER AREAS.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00027	THE FIRST SCREEN SHOT IS OUR YEAR OVER YEAR ACTIVE FUNDRAISERS AS YOU CAN SEE OUR CORE TEAM WHICH ARE OUR COORDINATORS SHOWED AN INCREASE IN ENGAGEMENT COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS YEARS
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00028	WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO HERE IS TAKE THIS POSITIVE ASPECT OF THE DATA AND USE IT TO IMPROVE OTHER AREAS THAT MAY NOT BE SEEING AS MUCH SUCCESS
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00029	DURING OUR MAIN EVENT WE WENT TO THIS CORE TEAM TO SEE WHAT WAS WORKING WELL FOR THEM WHICH WE WERE ABLE TO APPLY TO A TEAM LIKE OUR CAPTAINS AS YOU CAN SEE WHO MAY HAVE SHOWN A LITTLE BIT OF A DECREASE IN THEIR ACTIVE FUNDRAISERS.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00030	THE NEXT SCREEN SHOT IS INCOME PERCENTAGES THAT'S BROKEN DOWN BY POSITION USING THIS DOCUMENT WE'RE ABLE TO USE SIMILAR TOCTICS TO SEE WHAT'S WORKING WELL IN ORDER TO TARGET DIFFERENT AREAS OF FUNDRAISING SUCH AS OUR ALUMNATES
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00031	THE NEXT SCREENSHOT IS OF OUR TOTAL INTERNAL TEAM INCOME AND THIS CAN BE REALLY HELPFUL AS WE'RE ABLE TO LOOK AT THE SPECIFIC TIMES AND THAT OVERALL INCOME BROKEN DOWN BY TEAM TO SEE WHICH TEAM MAY NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A BOOST
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00032	IN FUNDRAISING OR EVEN IN ENGAGEMENT. IT LEADS US TO LOOKING AT HOW OUR ORGANIZATION MAY RESPOND BEST TO IMPLEMENTING NEW FUNDRAISING STRATEGIES IN THE MOMENT.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00034	IF YOUR PROGRAM IS ABLE TO LOOK AT THIS DATA IN THE MOMENT, YOU MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE QUICKER, MORE EFFICIENT AND SUCCESSFUL DECISIONS BASED ON HOW YOU BELIEVE THAT YOUR ORGANIZATION WILL RESPOND BECAUSE EVERY ORGANIZATION RESPONDS DIFFERENTLY.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00035	THIS COULD BE THINGS SUCH AS A COMPETITION-BASED FUNDRAISING CHALLENGE, LIVE UPDATES AND TRANSPARENCY WITH YOUR TOTALS OR EVEN SAYING THAT IT'S YOUR DANCER'S LAST CHANCE TO REACH THEIR GOAL.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00036	THE PURPOSE OF LOOKING AT THIS DATA IN DETAIL HERE THOUGH IS TO NOT BE AFRAID TO MAKE CHANGES WHILE IT'S HAPPENING
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00037	AND LEARNING THAT IT'S OKAY TO IMPLEMENT A BRAND NEW FUNDRAISING PUSH IN THE MOMENT DURING YOUR MARATHON, WHICH IS HOW WE STUMBLED ACROSS SOME SOLUTIONS THAT WE'VE CREATED SUCH AS FUNDRAISING FACE-UPS.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00039	NOW FUNDRAISING FACE UP BEGAN ORIGINALLY AS AN INTERNAL TEAM ONLY TRADITION
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00040	ON PUSH DAYS WHERE ALL OF OUR INTERNAL TEAMS COMPETED IN A BRACKET STYLE COMPETITION. WE REALLY HAVE AN OVERWHELMINGLY POSITIVE RESPONSE TO THIS INITIATIVE. SO MUCH THAT WE WERE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THIS WITH OUR ORGANIZATIONAL TEAMS AS WELL.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00042	IT REALLY HELPED TO PROMOTE A FRIENDLY COMPETITIVE ATMOSPHERE TO ENCOURAGE THAT POSITIVE FUNDRAISING MINDSET
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00044	TO ENCOURAGE THAT POSITIVE FUNDRAISING MINDSET TO ENCOURAGE THAT POSITIVE FUNDRAISING MINDSET TO ENCOURAGE THAT POSITIVE FUNDRAISING MINDSET TO ENCOURAGE THAT POSITIVE FUNDRAISING MINDSET TO ENCOURAGE THAT POSITIVE FUNDRAISING MINDSET TO ENCOURAGE THAT POSITIVE FUNDRAISING MINDSET TO ENCOURAGE THAT POSITIVE FUNDRAISING MINDSET TO ENCOURAGE THAT POSITIVE FUNDRAISING MINDSET TO ENCOURAGE THAT POSITIVE FUNDRAISING MINDSET TO ENCOURAGE THAT POSITIVE FUNDRAISING MINDSET TO ENCOURAGE THAT POSITIVE FUNDRAISING MINDSET TO ENCOURAGE THAT POSITIVE FUNDRAIS
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00046	SUCH AS ENCOURAGING THEM TO HIT THEIR TEAM GOAL OR EVEN REACHING AN INCENTIVE THAT THE CHAIR OR DELEGATE WAS GOING TO GIVE THEM. DURING OUR MAIN EVENT, WE WERE ABLE TO BROADCAST THIS IMAGE ON OUR SCREENS TO SHOW LIVE PROGRESS AND UPDATES.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00047	THE TEAMS WERE ABLE TO SEE THEIR PROGRESS LIVE ON THE SCREENS DURING OUR EVENT
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00048	AND OUR ORGANIZATIONS RESPONDED REALLY WELL TO THIS COMPETITION STYLE FUNDRAISING PUSH. SO THIS IS ONE WAY WE WERE ABLE TO SEE OUR DATA, LOOK AT IT, OKAY, MAYBE WE NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE IMPROVEMENT
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00049	IN THE FUNDRAISING AREAS OF OUR TEAMS SO THEREFORE WE WERE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THINGS SUCH AS FUNDRAISING FACE-OFF
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00051	SO POWER HOUR IS ANOTHER WAY THAT OUR PROGRAM AT FSU IMPLEMENTS TO KIND OF INCREASE FUNDRAISING WHEN IT'S NEEDED AFTER WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT DATA SO DURING POWER HOUR THIS HOUR IS SOLELY DEDICATED TO FUNDRAISING
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00052	HOWEVER YOU CAN SET WHATEVER GOAL YOU WANT WHATEVER THAT LOOKS LIKE FOR YOUR PROGRAM OR WHAT YOU THINK MAY WORK BEST
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00053	FOR EXAMPLE WE USE HIT YOUR NEXT 00 WHICH COULD MEAN GOING FROM $562 TO $600 DURING THIS HOUR
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00055	ANOTHER GOAL FOR POWER HOUR COULD BE TO REACH THEIR GOAL FOR THE PUSH OR FOR THE MARATHON OR EVEN HITTING THAT PERSONAL OR TEAM GOAL THAT THEY'D SET THROUGHOUT THE YEAR
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00057	WE WERE ABLE TO DISPLAY OUR INCREASING TOTAL LIVE DURING POWER HOUR ON THE SCREENS. THEY WERE UPDATED LIVE IN EVENT AS OUR MCS HOSTED THE WHOLE HOUR INCLUDING TEAM AND FUNDRAISER SHOUTOUTS TO THOSE WHO HIT THAT NEXT 00 MILESTONE.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00058	THIS DOCUMENT SCREEN SHOT ON THE BOTTOM IS FROM A LIST OF NAMES WE PULLED FROM A REPORT THAT INDICATED IF THEY HIT THAT NEXT DOUBLE ZERO IF THEY WERE ANNOUNCED BY THE MCS AND IF THEY HIT IT AGAIN DURING THE HOUR
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00059	THIS LIVE RECOGNITION REALLY RECOGNIZES THEM FOR THEIR HARD WORK AND WE WERE ALSO ABLE TO CONTINUOUSLY INTEGRATE OUR MORALE TEAM FOR ENCOURAGEMENT AND HYPE TO MAKE THIS HOUR SUPER EXCITING AND ENGAGING.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00060	SO POWER HOUR CAN BE ONE WAY TO KIND OF INCREASE THAT ENGAGEMENT AS WELL AS FUNDRAISING BRING BACK THAT COMMUNITY ASPECT TO FUNDRAISING AND FOSTER THAT POSITIVE FUNDRAISING MINDSET AS WELL
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00062	THIS YEAR WE REALLY BEGAN TO FOCUS MORE ON VENMO INTEGRATION WE REALLY WANTED OUR MEMBERS TO DONATE DIRECTLY FROM VENMO TO DONOR THROUGH DONOR DRIVE IN ORDER TO DISCOURAGE THEM FROM HOLDING THOSE VENMO BALANCES IN THEIR PERSONAL VENMO ACCOUNTS
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00063	WE REALLY HIGHLIGHTED DONATING DIRECTLY USING THIS VENMO TRANSACTION FEATURE IN DONOR DRIVE WHICH REALLY HELPED US TO ALSO SEE MORE REALISTIC NUMBERS IN OUR DATA WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT THAT DATA
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00064	IF OUR MONEY IS ACTUALLY GETTING PUT INTO THOSE DONOR DRIVE ACCOUNTS AND NOT JUST SITTING IN THOSE VENMO ACCOUNTS.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00065	THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE WERE ABLE TO PROMOTE THE USE OF THIS THOUGH AND WE WERE ABLE TO GET CREATIVE BASED ON THE AREAS WE NEEDED TO SEE A LITTLE BIT MORE INCREASE IN.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00066	THE NUMBER OF VENMO DONATIONS. ONE WAY THAT WE DID THIS WAS BY SAYING THAT EVERY TENTH VENMO DONATION IN THE NEXT HOUR WOULD BE MATCHED. TO DO THIS, WE PULLED A REPORT, FILTERED FOR VENMO DONATIONS, AND THEN WENT THROUGH EVERY TENTH ONE TO SEE WHICH ONE WOULD BE MATCHED.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00067	ANOTHER WAY THAT YOU MAY BE ABLE TO PROMOTE THE USE OF THIS FEATURE IS BY SAYING THAT THE TEAM WITH THE MOST VENMO TRANSACTIONS IN THE NEXT HOUR WINS SOME INCENTIVE THAT YOU SET FROM YOUR ORGANIZATION
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00069	AGAIN, YOU CAN DO THIS BY PULLING A REPORT TO SEE THOSE VENMO TRANSACTIONS AND LOOKING AT IT THAT WAY.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00071	LASTLY YOU CAN REALLY PROMOTE THE USE OF VENMO INTEGRATION FEATURE BY CREATING A MAIN PAGE FOR FEES AND TICKETS AND PROMOTING DONATING VIA VENMO IN THAT WAY
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00072	WE REALLY TARGETED THIS FEATURE WHEN IT SEEMS LIKE STUDENTS MAY BE HOLDING THEIR VENMO BALANCES OR OTHER TACTICS WEREN'T SHOWING AS MUCH SUCCESS AND IT WAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAT OUR PARTICIPANTS REALLY HADN'T SEEN BEFORE IN RARITHON THIS YEAR AND ENDED UP SEEING A LOT OF SUCCESS FROM IT
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00074	NEXT ONE OF MY FAVORITE WAYS TO RESPOND TO THOSE AREAS YOU MAY NEED TO IMPROVE IN AFTER LOOKING AT YOUR DATA IS BY IMPLEMENTING A FINAL FUNDRAISING PUSH WITHIN YOUR PUSH OR EVEN YOUR MAIN EVENT
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00075	SO THIS LAST YEAR AT OUR MARATHON OUR FUNDRAISING DEVELOPMENT TEAM KIND OF CREATED A THEME FOR FUNDRAISING FOR THE FOR OUR MARATHON WHICH WAS LEGOS
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00077	SO WE NAMED OUR FINAL FUNDRAISING PUSH BUILDING OUR LEGACY AND REALLY THE GOAL OF THIS PUSH WAS TO HIT YOUR OVERALL FUNDRAISING GOAL WHETHER THAT WAS A TEAM OR PERSONAL GOAL DURING THE VERY LAST HOUR OF THE EVENT
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00078	THIS REALLY SUCCESSFULLY ENCOURAGED OUR DANCERS TO REACH THEIR FINAL DOLLARS BEFORE THE END OF THEIR SHIFT AND GET ALL THEIR FUNDRAISING IN BEFORE THE YEAR WAS OVER
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00080	THIS GRAPHIC THAT'S ON THE SLIDES WAS DISPLAYED LIVE ON THE SCREENS AS WELL WHICH SHOWED INCREASING LEGO BLOCKS AS THE LAST HOUR UNFOLDED.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00081	FUNDRAISING INITIATIVES IN EVENTS SUCH AS THESE FINAL PUSHES REALLY EMPHASIZE HOW YOU CAN TRULY MAKE DECISIONS IN REAL TIME BY LOOKING AT YOUR DATA.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00082	THROUGH ALL OF THESE INITIATIVES WE'RE ABLE TO INCORPORATE BOTH ENGAGEMENT AND FUNDRAISING STRATEGIES TO KIND OF BUILD AND FOSTER THAT POSITIVE FUNDRAISING MINDSET THAT SOMETIMES YOU SEE LACKING DURING THOSE BIG FUNDRAISING PUSHES OR DURING THE MARATHON EVENT.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00083	SO THROUGH THESE THINGS YOU ARE NOT ONLY ABLE TO INCREASE FUNDRAISING AFTER LOOKING AT THE DATA AND AREAS YOU MAY NEED IMPROVEMENT BUT YOU ARE ALSO ABLE TO ENGAGE YOUR MEMBERS IN A NEW EXCITING WAY
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00084	THAT KIND OF BUILDS A MORE POSITIVE MINDSET AROUND THE ORGANIZATION AND AROUND THE FUNDRAISING ASPECT OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00086	BEING OPEN TO ADJUSTING AND BEING CREATIVE DURING YOUR EVENT WILL REALLY ALLOW YOU TO MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS FOR YOUR PROGRAM.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00087	AND TO TARGET THOSE AREAS YOU MAY NEED TO SEE MORE SUCCESS IN OR YOU MAY WANT TO SEE MORE SUCCESS IN WITH FUNDRAISING
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00088	AND THE END OF THE DAY IT'S TRULY ALL ABOUT BEING READY TO MAKE CHANGES, BEING ADAPTABLE AND REALLY GIVING YOUR PARTICIPANTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO FUNDRAISE CREATIVELY AND HAVE FUN WHILE DOING IT.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00089	BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY ALL WE WANT TO DO IS FOSTER THAT POSITIVE FUNDRAISING MINDSET AND DRAW THAT CAUSE CONNECTION BACK TO THE ORGANIZATION AND HELP OUR PARTICIPANTS REALIZE WHY THEY'RE FUNDRAISING AND WHY THEY'RE DOING THIS AT THE END OF THE DAY
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00091	THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR LISTENING TODAY PLEASE DON'T HESITATE TO REACH OUT IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT LOOKING AT YOUR DATA HOW TO IMPLEMENT THESE STRATEGIES INTO YOUR PROGRAM BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WHATEVER WORKS BEST FOR YOUR PROGRAM WORKS ALL PROGRAMS ARE DIFFERENT
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00092	BUT REALLY INCORPORATING THOSE ENGAGEMENT STRATEGIES AND FUNDRAISING STRATEGIES IN ORDER TO BUILD THAT CAUSE CONNECTION TRUST WITHIN YOUR ORGANIZATION
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00093	AND THAT POSITIVE FUNDRAISING MINDSET IS REALLY WHAT WILL HELP YOU BEST RESPOND TO YOUR DATA IN THE MOMENT WHEN YOU NEED IT THE MOST. THANK YOU ALL.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00002	Alyssa Guzzi, We are here today to talk about work for colleges registration push day i'm Alyssa guzzi i'm the campus relations chair.

YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00007	WE ARE IN WAVERLY, IOWA, A SMALLER TOWN. WE HAVE ABOUT 1500 STUDENTS ON OUR CAMPUS. OUR ORGANIZATION WAS ESTABLISHED IN 2007.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00008	AND SEVEN TO TWENTY TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SEVEN AND SE
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00009	AND WE CURRENTLY HAVE AN AWARD FOR OUR MIRACLE MAKER AWARD THAT MEANS THAT LIKE WE HAVE WE'VE BEEN IN AN ORGANIZATION FOR LIKE BETWEEN TEN TO FOURTEEN YEARS AND WE GOT THAT AWARD AND WE'RE NUMBER SEVEN IN THE NATION FOR THE AMOUNT WE HAVE RAISED FOR CAPITOL
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00011	SO WHAT IS REGISTRATION PUSH DAY REGISTRATION PUSH DAY IS A DAY THAT WE SET AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SCHOOL YEAR IT'S OUR FIRST EVENT AND WE TRY TO GET AS MANY PARTICIPANTS SIGN UP DURING THAT DAY
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00013	SO SOME STRATEGIES THAT WE USE IS WE'RE SENDING OUT EMAILS TO LAPSEN PARTICIPANTS AT MIDNIGHT
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00014	SO HOW WE DO THIS IS WE GET OUR LIST FROM LAST YEAR THAT WERE IN DANCE MARATHON AND WE SEND IT TO THEM AND THEN FOR OUR FIRST YEARS TO GET THEM INVOLVED
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00015	AS THEY DO AN INVOLVEMENT FAIR DURING ORIENTATION WEEK AND IF THEY ARE INTERESTED THEY COME TO OUR BOOTH AND SIGN UP AN EMAIL TO SEND OUT TO THEM
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00016	AND WE ALSO IN OUR EMAILS SEND OUT LINKS TO THEM ON THAT TOO. WE DO A PROMO CODE. USUALLY IT'S LIKE $5 OFF THAT DAY.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00017	WE ALSO CAN TEXT TO 51555 TO REGISTER WE TRY TO SET GOALS THINK OF BIGGER PICTURES AND BREAK DOWN STRATEGIES WE USUALLY DO A POWER HOUR
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00018	WHICH IS USUALLY BETWEEN SEVEN TO EIGHT OR EIGHT TO NINE AND DURING THAT HOUR WE TRIED TO GET AS MANY PARTICIPANTS SIGN UP DURING THAT TIME AND OUR OF COURSE OUR EXEC TEAM CONTINUES TO RECRUIT THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE DAY
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00020	SO WHAT IS THE KEY TO OUR SUCCESSFUL REGISTRATION PUSH DAY? IT'S OUR MORALE CAPTAINS. OUR MORALE CAPTAINS ARE BASICALLY THE SIR OF THE SHOWS. THEY HELP RUN EVERYTHING.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00021	THERE'S USUALLY A COMPETITION BETWEEN OUR MORALE CAPTAINS
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00022	JUST TO SEE WHO CAN GET THE MOST AMOUNT OF PARTICIPANTS. IT'S USUALLY LAST YEAR I THINK IT WAS A HYDRO FLASK AND A GIFT CARD OR LIKE JUST SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO LIKE KIND OF HELP THEM NOT GET MOTIVATED BUT LIKE A REWARD FOR THEIR HARD WORK.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00023	OUR MORALE CAPTAINS ALSO PRINT OUT QR CODES AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY SIGN THEM UP FOR THEIR TEAM
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00024	.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00025	SO THEY DO THAT THEY HAVE THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL PROMO CODE SO IT'S LIKE ANOTHER OF THE FIVE DOLLARS OFF
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00026	AND THEN GETTING THEM EXCITED FOR IT AND GIVING THEM THE RESOURCES TO SUCCEED. IF YOU DON'T HAVE MORALE CAPTAINS, OUR CLOSEST PROBABLY THING WOULD BE LIKE HAVING AN EXEC TEAM
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00027	OR ANYBODY THAT'S LIKE REALLY CLOSE UM OR REALLY INVOLVED WITHIN DANCE MARATHON IT'D BE ANOTHER WAY JUST TO BASICALLY JUST LIKE GIVE A PRICE WHOEVER RECRUITS THE MOST AMOUNT OF PEOPLE OR SOMETHING UM JUST TO REWARD THEM FOR EVERYTHING THAT THEY HAVE DONE FOR THE SUCCESSFUL DAY
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00029	SO WHAT IS THE REASON TO JOIN WELL THERE'S ALWAYS SO MANY DIFFERENT REASONS TO JOIN BUT SOME THREE BIG ONES IS A SOCIAL CAUSE CAUSE CONNECTION ACADEMIC OR PROFESSIONAL RESUME BUILDER FOR LEADERSHIP AND EXPERIENCE
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00030	SO FOR ME MINE WAS ALWAYS A CAUSE CONNECTION IN HIGH SCHOOL WE HAD A STUDENT IN MY GRADE THAT HAD LEUKEMIA CANCER AND WE ALWAYS TRIED TO FUNDRAISE
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00031	AND I ALWAYS WANTED TO CONTINUE SOMEHOW TO FUNDRAISE FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA STEED FAMILY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00033	DOES THIS WORK? IT WORKS, YES, IT DOES. SO WE STARTED THIS ABOUT IN THE FALL OF 2020.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00034	TWENTY TWO YEARS AGO AND THAT'S KIND OF WHEN WE DECIDED HEY LET'S DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO REGISTER AND GET AS MANY PEOPLE AS WE CAN FROM ORFUR TO JOIN THIS ORGANIZATION UM AND OH OKAY
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00035	SO IN 2020 2021 WE RECRUITED 252 PARTICIPANTS AND WE HAD 340 OVERALL
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00036	AND THEN IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO WE RECRUITED THREE HUNDRED PARTICIPANTS ON THAT DAY AND HAD ONLY THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE TOTAL TOTAL
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00037	SO OUR REGISTRATION FIRST DAY IS OUR FIRST EVENT OF THE YEAR SO BASICALLY WE'RE NOT FUNDRAISING AT ALL ANY MONEY OR ANYTHING FOR OUR DONOR DRIVES WE'RE JUST SOLELY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET THE MOST PEOPLE INVOLVED
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00038	WITH OUR ORGANIZATION ON CAMPUS AND IT IS A SURPRISE
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00039	AND ONLY THE EXECUTIVE TEAM KNOWS SO IT IS KIND OF LIKE A SPUR OF THE MOMENT. OH, THERE IS THIS INVOLVEMENT FAIR, WE CAN SIGN UP THERE OR OH, WE ARE JUST GOING TO HAVE A BIG PARTY ON CAMPUS LAWN, THAT KIND OF STUFF.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00041	SO HOW DOES IT HELP MY PROGRAM SO OUR FUNDRAISING IMPROVED TREMENDOUSLY ON CHILDREN'S HEALTH DAY IN 2019 WE ONLY FUNDRAISED $1,700
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00042	AND THEN IN CHILDREN'S HEALTH DAY IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWENTY WE FUNDRAISED SIX THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE DOLLARS AND TWENTY NINE CENTS WE WERE SECOND IN IOWA FOR FUNDRAISING TWENTY SECOND IN THE NATION FOR FUNDRAISING AND SECOND IN OUR TIER
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00043	AND THEN ON CHILDREN'S HEALTH DAY IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE FUNDRAISED EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND THEN FOR THE WEEK WE DID FUNDRAISE FIFTEEN HUNDRED
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00045	SO SOME OTHER THINGS THAT WE ALSO USE ARE THESE GRAPHICS SO ON THE LEFT WE HAVE A QR CODE WE HAVE THIS POSTED ON OUR SOCIAL MEDIA A LOT
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00046	AND ALSO WE PRINT THEM OUT AND HAVE IT POSTED THROUGHOUT OUR CAMPUS SO IT'S EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO SCAN IT ON THEIR PHONE INSTEAD OF CHECKING THEIR EMAILS A LOT AND THEN WE ALSO DO ON THE RIGHT THROUGHOUT THE DAY WE JUST WANT TO THANK OUR
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00048	PARTICIPANTS THAT HAVE SIGNED UP SO FAR AND WE USUALLY SEND THEM OUT AN EMAIL THANK YOU-ING THEM AND WE ALSO SEND IT OUT ON OUR SOCIAL MEDIA AND POST IT THERE.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00050	AND POST IT THERE.

YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00052	WE USUALLY HAVE LIKE UH MUSIC BEING PLAYED SO IT'S KIND OF LOUD AT CAMPUS TRYING TO DRAW ATTENTION TO PEOPLE THAT TYPE OF STUFF
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00002	Hello. Hi, everyone. How are you doing? Thank you very much for joining this workshop and for organizing this event. It's really exciting to have all of you here.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00003	AND SO I JUST WANTED TO BRIEFLY INTRODUCE MYSELF
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00004	UH I AM LAUREN AND AS UH AS MARTIN SAID I'M THE CEO AND CO-FOUNDER OF ANIMAL ADVOCACY CAREERS UM MY BACKGROUND IS IN CLIENT CONSULTANCY SO I USED TO WORK FOR A GLOBAL MARKET RESEARCH COMPANY AND I AM NOW IN THE NON-PROFIT WORLD
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00005	SO HOPEFULLY I CAN GIVE YOU ALL SOME GUIDANCE ON HOW TO NAVIGATE THAT SITUATION SO CAN EVERYONE SEE MY SCREEN? CAN I JUST GET A THUMBS UP IF YOU CAN SEE THE SCREEN?
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00006	WONDERFUL THANK YOU OKAY SO WE'RE GOING WELL SO FAR I'M USUALLY QUITE BAD WITH THIS TECHNICAL STUFF OKAY SO THE GOAL FOR THIS WORKSHOP
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00007	IS THAT WE WILL ALL LEAVE THE WORKSHOP WITH AT LEAST ONE NEW RESOURCE CONNECTION IDEA OR ACTION THAT WE CAN TAKE AWAY TO HELP YOU PROGRESS YOUR CAREER
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00009	AND SO THE IDEA OF THE WORKSHOP ITSELF IS TO DISCUSS HOW TO USE YOUR CAREER MORE EFFECTIVELY AND TO ESSENTIALLY HELP MORE ANIMALS THROUGH OUR CAREER
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00010	BUT IN ORDER THAT WE DO THIS IT'S ACTUALLY VITAL TO SPEND SOME TIME ACTUALLY PLANNING THIS AND THERE'S TWO REASONS FOR THIS THE FIRST ONE IS BECAUSE NOT ALL ULTRASTIC ACTIONS ARE EQUAL
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00011	AND THE SECONDLY IS THAT SOMETIME THINKING OR PLANNING COULD ACTUALLY MULTIPLY THE IMPACT YOU HAVE BY UP TO 10 TO 100 TIMES WHICH IS QUITE A LOT
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00012	OF TIME. SO JUST MOVE ON SIDE. OKAY. HERE'S A SUMMARY OF WHAT THE SESSION WILL ENTAIL.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00013	I WILL BE DOING A 20 MINUTE PRESENTATION GOING THROUGH DIFFERENT STEPS OF THE CAREER DECISION MAKING PROCESS AND OUTLINING AVAILABLE RESOURCES WHICH YOU CAN LOOK INTO IN MORE DETAIL AFTER THE PRESENTATION
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00014	AND THEN WE WILL DO FIVE TO TEN MINUTES OF INTRODUCTION.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00015	AND THEN I AM GOING TO GIVE YOU SOME FINAL RESOURCES THAT YOU CAN AGAIN TAKE AWAY AND DO SOME MORE LIKE PLANNING AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO JOIN A GROUP
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00016	WHERE WE'RE GOING TO ALL JUST KIND OF LIKE DISCUSS AND MARTIN IS GOING TO VERY KINDLY ASSIGN YOU ALL TO DIFFERENT GROUPS WITH DIFFERENT INSTRUCTIONS AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO FINISH WITH A Q&A SESSION.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00018	OKAY SO A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT ANIMAL ADVOCACY CAREERS AS WE SAID IT WAS CREATED TO HELP INDIVIDUALS MAXIMIZE THEIR POTENTIAL AND THEIR POSITIVE IMPACT FOR ANIMALS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00019	AND I GUESS THERE ARE MANY WAYS THAT WE CAN THINK ABOUT HOW AN INDIVIDUAL MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO HELPING ANIMALS AND ONE MIGHT BE THAT AN INDIVIDUAL MIGHT MAKE A DIETARY CHANGE LIKE BE VEGAN OR VEGETARIAN
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00020	BUT ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE ARE MOST EXCITED AT ANIMAL ADVOCACY CAREER IS THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN MAKE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT FOR ANIMALS IS THROUGH UTILISING OUR CAREER
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00021	IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED THROUGH RESEARCH THAT MOST INDIVIDUALS SPEND APPROXIMATELY 80,000 HOURS OF THEIR TIME
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00022	AND THEIR LIVES IN A CAREER. SO IT KIND OF MAKES SENSE AND A KEY FACTOR WHERE INDIVIDUALS CAN MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE TO ANIMALS WOULD BE TO UTILISE THEIR CAREER TO HELP AS MANY ANIMALS AS POSSIBLE.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00023	AND WITH SUCH A BIG OPPORTUNITY AT STAKE IT'S ARGUABLY OUR DUTY TO SPEND SOME REAL TIME THINKING THROUGH OUR OPPORTUNITIES AND THINKING THROUGH A CONCRETE STRATEGY OF HOW WE CAN HELP ACTUAL INDIVIDUAL ANIMALS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00024	THROUGH OUR CAREERS. IT MIGHT SEEM A LITTLE BORING SOME PEOPLE MIGHT THINK IT'S OVERWHELMING AND SLIGHTLY MELODRAMATIC BUT IF WE ACTUALLY TAKE THROUGH A SCENARIO WHERE WE MAYBE WOULD HAVE TWO JOB OPPORTUNITIES I THINK WE CAN MAYBE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00025	TALK THROUGH THIS A LITTLE BIT MORE SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU MIGHT HAVE A JOB OPPORTUNITY WHERE IT'S THE FIRST ONE THAT COMES TO YOU AND IT WOULD ENABLE YOU TO HELP 100 ANIMALS OVER THE COURSE OF FIVE YEARS OF YOUR CAREER
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00026	BUT HAD YOU WAITED FOR TWO WEEKS LONGER THEN YOU WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE THE CHANCE TO HELP TEN TIMES THAT AMOUNT OF ANIMALS IN THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00027	SO AS YOU CAN SEE THERE CAN BE VERY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES TO YOU BEING ABLE TO MAKE AN IMPACT JUST THROUGH A SMALL CHOICE THAT YOU WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00028	SO ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS THAT THERE'S DISPARITY BETWEEN OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDIVIDUAL IMPACT AND WE ALSO HAVE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00029	SO IT MAKES SENSE THAT WE TRY AND THINK THROUGH OPTIONS AND PRIORITIZE THEM ALL ACCORDINGLY SO THAT WE CAN ASSESS OPPORTUNITIES WHEN THEY ARRIVE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00031	SO WHERE DO WE BEGIN WITH THIS? MOST OF THIS IS LIFTED FROM AN EXCELLENT ARTICLE ON EACH OF OUR WEBSITE WHICH I WOULD RECOMMEND TO EVERYBODY
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00032	WHICH IS CALLED HOW TO MAKE TOUGH CAREER OPTIONS. SORRY, HOW TO MAKE TOUGH CAREER DECISIONS. SO THIS WILL HELP US TO BUILD A REALLY STRONG FRAMEWORK FOR PRIORITIZATION
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00033	FOR FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES AND ALSO PLAN OUT OUR STRATEGY TO MAXIMIZE OUR IMPACT. SO STEP ONE IS TO CLARIFY THE DECISION THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00034	MAKE SO WE WANT TO HAVE A CLEAR IDEA OF EXACTLY WHAT IT IS THAT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE THROUGH OUR CAREER STRATEGIC PLANNING
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00035	AND SO FOR IT MIGHT BE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL THAT YOU MIGHT BE CHOOSING BETWEEN TWO CONCRETE JOB OPPORTUNITIES
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00036	SOME PEOPLE MIGHT BE WANTING TO DO LONG-TERM CAREER STRATEGY
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00037	BUT FOR THE SAKE OF THIS WORKSHOP AND THE WIDEST APPLICABILITY WE'RE GOING TO CONSIDER COMING UP WITH MORE OF OUR LIKE MEDIUM TERM OPTIONS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00039	AND SO IF WE'RE TAKING MEDIUM TERM THEN WE START TO THINK ABOUT WHAT ARE OUR MOST IMPORTANT PRIORITIES FOR THIS.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00040	AND SO THIS WILL OBVIOUSLY BE QUITE INDIVIDUAL AND IT WILL BE VERY UNIQUE TO SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS ON THEIR PRIORITIES
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00041	BUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE WRITTEN DOWN HERE WOULD HELP AN INDIVIDUAL TO REALLY TRY AND MAXIMIZE THEIR POTENTIAL THROUGH THEIR CAREER
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00042	SO THE FIRST IS IMPACT POTENTIAL THEN WE HAVE PERSONAL FITS AND CAREER CAPITAL OPTION VALUE VALUE OF INFORMATION
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00043	AND I'M GOING TO GO THROUGH EACH OF THESE IN SLIGHTLY MORE DETAIL TO TRY AND REMOVE THE JARGON AND ALSO TO GIVE YOU ALL SOME RESOURCES SO THAT YOU CAN LOOK THEM UP INDIVIDUALLY AFTERWARDS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00045	SO THE FIRST AND ARGUABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT IS ACTUALLY IMPACT POTENTIAL SO HOW MUCH IMPACT POTENTIAL DO YOU HAVE WITH EACH OF THE JOB OPPORTUNITIES THAT YOU'RE CONSIDERING
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00047	THIS IS PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS OF IT AN EXCELLENT GUIDE FOR THIS IS THE CENTER FOR EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVISM RESOURCES PAGE WHICH GOES THROUGH THIS IN A LOT MORE IN A LOT MORE DETAIL
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00048	BECAUSE A LOT OF IT COMES DOWN TO CORE PRIORITIZATION I'M ASSUMING THAT MOST OF US HERE ARE THINKING ABOUT
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00049	TRYING TO HELP ANIMALS BUT THEN FROM THAT YOU ARE ALSO RESTRICTED BY THE SPECIFIC CAUSE THAT YOU'RE FOCUSED ON SO IT COULD BE THAT YOU
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00050	THAT THE THE NEXT PARTICULAR THING WOULD BE THAT YOU HAVE TO DECIDE BETWEEN EITHER FOCUSING ON COMPANION ANIMALS OR FARMED ANIMALS AND AN EXCELLENT RESOURCE FOR THAT IS ANIMAL CHARITY EVALUATORS WHY FARMED ANIMALS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00051	THEY ALSO HAVE CHARITY REVIEWS AND INTERVENTION REVIEWS AS WELL BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S NOT JUST THE FACT THAT YOU BE CONSIDERING CAUSE PRIORITIZATION
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00052	BUT YOU ALSO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT SPECIFICALLY UM WHAT KIND OF ROLE THAT YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY BE THINKING ABOUT OR CONSIDERING AND HOW MUCH IMPACT POTENTIAL THAT ROLE HAS AS WELL
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00054	SO THE NEXT TERMS THAT WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT ARE PERSONAL FIT, PERSONAL SATISFACTION, CAREER CAPITAL, OPTION VALUE AND VALUE OF INFORMATION
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00055	SO I'VE BUCKETED A LOT INTO THIS ONE SECTION BUT THE REASON IS BECAUSE A LOT OF THE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE ON THIS ARE VERY SIMILAR
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00056	SO WE'VE GOT EIGHTY THOUSAND HOURS CAREER VIEWS WHICH GOES THROUGH THIS IN A LOT MORE DETAIL SOME OF THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE AT AAC LIKE THE SKILLS PROFILES
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00057	WE'LL GO THROUGH AND INCLUDE SOME TIPS FOR THINGS LIKE PERSONAL FIT AND WE ALSO HAVE A GLOSSARY OF TERMS TO GO THROUGH THESE IN MORE DETAIL
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00058	BUT ESSENTIALLY WE JUST NEED TO THINK ABOUT EACH ONE OF THESE FACTORS AND HOW IMPORTANT IT ACTUALLY IS AND BUT TO REMEMBER THEM ALL WHEN WE'RE CONSIDERING CAREER OPPORTUNITIES SO THAT WE'RE ABLE TO ADEQUATELY PRIORITIZE BETWEEN OPPORTUNITIES
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00060	AND SO THERE'S SOME INDIVIDUAL RESEARCH YOU CAN DO AS WELL WHICH IS MOSTLY JUST GOOGLING LOOKING THROUGH RESOURCES BUT ANOTHER REALLY GOOD WAY TO ACTUALLY FIND OUT SOME MORE INFORMATION IS TO ASK INDIVIDUALS THAT YOU MIGHT KNOW ALREADY
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00061	SO WHEN YOU HAVE TO SOME JOB OPPORTUNITIES THAT YOU MIGHT BE THINKING ABOUT TO GO THROUGH THESE DIFFERENT METRICS AND ASK INDIVIDUALS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00062	WHAT THEY THINK THE CAREER CAPITAL OPPORTUNITIES ARE, THE OPTION VALUE OR THE VALUE OF INFORMATION.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00064	AND SO WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT INDIVIDUAL POTENTIAL SO THAT'S LIKE THE INDIVIDUAL METRICS AND HOW EACH OPPORTUNITY MIGHT HELP YOU AS AN INDIVIDUAL TO PROGRESS YOUR CAREER FOR ANIMALS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00065	AND THE NEXT THING THAT WE WANT TO THINK ABOUT IS COMMUNITY SO WE WANT TO ALSO CONSIDER THE FACT THAT EACH ONE OF THESE JOB OPPORTUNITIES HAS SIGNIFICANT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SIGNIFICANTLY HELP THE COMMUNITY IN TWO WAYS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00066	ONE IS TO CONSIDER OUR RELATIVE FIT OR OUR COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE SO UM HOW WE WOULD COMPARE TO SOMEBODY ELSE WHO WOULD ALSO BE TAKING THAT OPPORTUNITY
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00067	AND THE SECOND IS COMMUNITY CAPITAL SO HOW DO WE AS AN INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTE TO THE WIDER COMMUNITY BY THE ROLE THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY TAKING
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00068	AND THESE ARE QUITE IMPORTANT ASPECTS AND CAN REALLY SHIFT HOW MUCH IMPACT ONE COULD HAVE FROM TWO OPPORTUNITIES THAT YOU MIGHT BE CONSIDERING.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00069	THAT IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TO ACTUALLY ASSESS THIS BY THEMSELVES. SO WE AT AAC HAVE SPENT A LITTLE BIT OF TIME THIS YEAR TRYING TO HELP INDIVIDUALS REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00070	THROUGH TWO THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE ONE IS THE ANIMAL ADVOCACY SPOT CHECK AND THE SECOND IS OUR TALENT BOTTLENECK SURVEY
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00071	SO BOTH OF THESE WERE CONDUCTED TO HELP INDIVIDUALS UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THIS THERE'S SOME VARIOUS LIMITATIONS TO SPOT CHECK WHICH MY COFOUNDER JAMIE CONDUCTED
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00072	TO THE SPOT CHECK WHICH MY CO FOUNDER AH JAMIE CONDUCTED ONE THAT YOU NEED TO BE AWARE OF IS THAT THEY ARE JUST CURRENTLY FILLED RULES AND THE ONES THAT WERE CURRENTLY ADVERTISED
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00073	AND IT'S ALSO JUST A SNAPSHOT OF A SPECIFIC PERIOD OF TIME AND WE'RE HOPING THAT IN FUTURE WE'LL ALSO BE ABLE TO RETROSPECTIVELY GO BACK AND COMPARE THE TWO
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00074	BUT SOME NOTABLE POINTS WHICH MIGHT BE WORTH CONSIDERING WAS THAT BOTH FUNDRAISING AND OPERATIONS ROLES WERE OVERREPRESENTED IN THE ADVERTISED JOB OPPORTUNITIES COMPARED TO THE CURRENT ROLES.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00075	THIS SUGGESTS THAT FILLING ROLES IS DIFFICULT FOR EFFECTIVE ANIMAL ADVOCACY NON-PROFITS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00076	AND ALSO PROVIDES WEAK EVIDENCE THAT OPERATIONS EXPERTISE IS A BOTTLEMECK FOR EFFECTIVE ANIMAL ADVOCACY NONPROFITS.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00077	AND THE SECOND WAS THAT CAMPAIGN ROLES AND RESEARCH ROLES WERE BOTH SLIGHTLY UNDERREPRESENTED IN JOB ADS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00078	THIS MATCHES OUR IMPRESSION THAT THESE ROLES ARE GENERALLY POPULAR AND OVERSUBSCRIBED IN THE JOB SPECIFICATIONS FOR ADVERTISED JOB ROLES, COMMUNICATION SKILLS AND ENGLISH LANGUAGE WERE FREQUENTLY REQUESTED AS IMPORTANT
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00079	AND REMOTE WORK WAS COMMON BUT FLEXIBILITY BY COUNTRY OF RESIDENCY WAS NOT.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00080	MOST JOBS REQUIRED EXPERIENCE IN RELATED TYPES OF ROLES SO THE AVERAGE ROLL THE AVERAGE FOR THIS WAS ABOUT 1.8 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE TO WAS REQUIRED IN EACH ONE OF THESE JOB ROLES
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00082	SO THE SECOND THING WE DID WAS CONDUCT THE THIS TIME LAST YEAR ACTUALLY 12 CEOs AND HIRING PROFESSIONALS FROM NINE OF THE TEN STANDOUT CHARITIES CURRENTLY LISTED ON ANIMAL CHARITY EVALUATORS PAGE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00083	FORMALLY OR NOW AND THAT WAS ASKING THE ORGANIZATIONS LIKE WHAT BOTTLENECK DO YOU MOST IDENTIFY AT THE ORGANIZATIONS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00084	AS YOU CAN SEE OVERWHELMINGLY FUNDRAISING AND UNSURPRISINGLY FUNDING WAS THE MAJOR BOTTLENECK FOR ORGANIZATIONS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00085	BUT INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH 75% OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS SAID THEY WOULD PRIORITIZE HIRING FUNDRAISERS IN FUTURE RATHER THAN JUST HAVING THE DONATIONS THEMSELVES AND THAT WAS TO ENABLE THEM TO HAVE MORE OF A SUSTAINABLE CASH FLOW
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00086	AND SO SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS MATCHED UP QUITE WELL AND THE SURVEY THAT WE DID VERSUS THE SPOT CHECK
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00087	AND OTHER THINGS WERE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT. SO IN THIS, FOR EXAMPLE, THERE WAS QUITE A LOT OF MENTION OF PEOPLE STRUGGLING TO HIRE SENIOR MANAGERS AND LEADERS.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00088	AND WHICH INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH WAS ALSO IN THE FOR ANALYTICS SURVEY THAT JUST RECENTLY CAME OUT BUT IT WASN'T MATCHED IN THE SPOT CHECK SO THAT'S EITHER AN ISSUE WITH OUR SPOT CHECK OR JUST LIKE A
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00089	SOME RANDOM VARIANCE BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT WE CAN TRY AND GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE KEY BOTTLENECKS SO THAT WHEN INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE OPTION WHERE ALL ELSE BEING EQUAL ON INDIVIDUAL LEVEL THE TWO OPTIONS ARE SIMILAR
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00090	THAT YOU CAN HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE IMPACT FOR ANIMALS BY TAKING AN OPPORTUNITY WHERE THERE'S A KEY TALENT BOTTLENECK IN THE ANIMAL ADVOCACY COMMUNITY
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00091	VERSUS THE OTHER ONE WHERE YOUR COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE IS MINIMALLY LOW.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00093	AND AGAIN THESE TERMS ARE ON OUR WEBSITE ON OUR GLOSSARY OF THEM IN TERMS OF THAT'S HELPFUL FOR PEOPLE AND SO YOU'VE GOT THOSE TWO WHICH I'VE JUST DISCUSSED WITH YOU AND THAT AGAIN I WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO ASK INDIVIDUALS THAT YOU MIGHT KNOW
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00094	ABOUT WHAT THEY THINK THEIR KEY BUSTLE NECKS ARE OR TO ASK PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THESE ROLES LIKE IF THEY THINK THAT
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00095	THAT THEY'RE PARTICULARLY OVER OR UNDERSUBSCRIBED UM BUT JUST GENERALLY ASKING MORE PEOPLE UM AND ENCOURAGING THEM TO GIVE YOU FEEDBACK ON ON YOUR COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE IN COMPARISON TO OTHER PEOPLE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00096	AND IT'S REALLY GOOD UM AT THE END OF THIS YEAR WE'LL ALSO BE TRYING TO LOOK INTO SOME MORE RESEARCH MAYBE ABOUT QUALITY ADJUSTED STAFF MEMBERS AND HOW MUCH INCREMENTAL IN
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00097	INCREMENTAL IMPACT INDIVIDUALS CAN HAVE BUT THAT'S NOT UNTIL THE END OF THIS YEAR SO FEEL FREE TO REACH OUT TO PEOPLE AND TALK
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00099	OKAY SO I'VE TALKED QUITE A LOT NOW AND NOW MY SCREEN HAS DECIDED TO DO THAT SO I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT THAT SO THE NEXT PART OF THE PRESENTATION IS THAT WE WANT TO GENERATE SOME MORE OPTIONS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00100	AND SO THE IDEA NOW IS THAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH STEP ONE WHICH IS TO CLARIFY OUR DECISION WE'VE GONE THROUGH STEP TWO WHICH IS TO THINK ABOUT OUR KEY PRIORITIES
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00101	AND OUR THIRD STEP WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT IS TO GENERATE SOME OPTIONS I KNOW PEOPLE ARE USUALLY QUITE RELUCTANT TO DO THIS AND THEY WILL USUALLY COME UP WITH ONE OR TWO BUT I WANT TO TRY AND ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY TO THINK OF AS MANY OPTIONS AS THEY CAN
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00102	BECAUSE IT TENDS TO BE THE SITUATION THAT WE UNDER
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00103	COME UP WITH OPTIONS RATHER THAN OVER COME UP WITH OPTIONS AND THEN THE ONES THAT YOU FIRST COME UP WITH ARE NEVER THE BEST ONE SO YOU NEED TO KEEP THINKING UM I'M GOING TO PUT UP A FEW OPTIONS HERE THAT PEOPLE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00104	AND SO YOU COULD WORK FOR A NONPROFIT YOU COULD WORK FOR ANIMAL FREE FROM COMPANY YOU COULD WORK IN MANAGEMENT AND LEADERSHIP
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00105	YOU COULD WORK FOR A NONPROFIT YOU COULD WORK FOR A NONPROFIT LOBBYING, START A NEW CHARITY YOU COULD WORK FOR A NONPROFIT LOBBYING, START A NEW CHARITY WORK IN THE LEGAL SPACE, MARKETING OR COMMUNICATIONS AND ALL OF THESE RESOURCES THAT I'M PUTTING UP HERE WILL MAYBE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00106	TRY AND HELP AND ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK OF IT MAYBE INSPIRE YOU TO THINK OF SOME MORE OPTIONS AND I THINK THAT WE SHOULD ALL JUST TAKE A FEW MINUTES NOW TO UH TO THINK ABOUT THESE UM OPTIONS SO I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU UM
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00107	TWO OR THREE MINUTES MAYBE UM JUST TO THINK ABOUT SOME MORE OPTIONS THAT EACH OF US COULD THINK ABOUT TO HAVE MORE IMPACT FOR ANIMALS AND THE IDEA HERE IS JUST SOME REALLY ROUGH BRAINSTORMING
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00108	THINKING ABOUT DIFFERENT OPTIONS AND UM AND THEN WE WILL GO ON TO THE NEXT STAGE BUT I'M GOING TO PAUSE FOR A SECOND SO EVERYONE THINK ABOUT YOUR OPTIONS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00111	I'm also going to put up some tips on the next screen to help you think about your options.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00113	HOW YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR OPTIONS AND HOW YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR OPTIONS AND HOW YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR OPTIONS AND HOW YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR OPTIONS AND HOW YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR OPTIONS AND HOW YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR OPTIONS AND HOW YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR OPTIONS AND HOW YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR OPTIONS AND HOW YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR OPTIONS AND HOW YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR OPTIONS AND HOW YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR OPTIONS AND HOW YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR OPTIONS AND HOW YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR OPTIONS AND HOW YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR OPTIONS AND HOW YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR OPTIONS AND HOW YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR OPTIONS AND HOW YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR OPTIONS AND HOW YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR OPTIONS AND HOW YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR OPTIONS AND HOW YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR OPTIONS AND HOW YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR OPTIONS AND HOW YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR OPTIONS AND HOW YOU THINK
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00115	I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT. SO OBVIOUSLY THAT WASN'T ENOUGH TIME FOR YOU ALL TO GENERATE AS MANY OPTIONS AS IS POSSIBLE FOR EACH OF YOU. BUT HOPEFULLY IT'S GIVEN YOU SOME INSPIRATION OR AT LEAST STARTED TO MAKE YOU THINK ABOUT MORE OPTIONS THAT ARE POTENTIAL FOR YOU.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00116	SO AFTER THIS THE NEXT STEP THAT WE WANT TO TAKE IS RANKING THESE OPTIONS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00117	SO I'LL SHARE THESE SLIDES ON THE FACEBOOK GROUP AFTERWARDS SO YOU CAN ALL SPEND SOME REAL TIME THINKING ABOUT THEM BUT THE IDEA IS TO TRY AND GET YOU
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00118	INTO THE SPACE OF GENERATING SOME MORE OPTIONS. THE NEXT STEP IS TO RANK YOUR OPTIONS.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00119	SO AGAIN I WANT YOU TO DO JUST LIKE A REALLY ROUGH INITIAL RANKING OF YOUR OPTIONS THROUGH JUST INTRODUCTION AND NOT TRY AND THINK TOO MUCH ABOUT IT BUT THE IDEA WOULD BE TO TAKE THOSE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00120	TAKE ALL THE PRIORITIES THAT WE DISCUSSED IN STEP TWO AND THINK ABOUT THE OPTIONS THAT WE'VE JUST GENERATED AND RANK THEM AGAINST EACH OTHER SO WHICH ONES SEEM LIKE THE LIKELY
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00121	HIGHEST OPPORTUNITY JUST BASED ON INTUITION NOT THROUGH DOING ANY RESEARCH OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT WHERE WE THINK EACH ONE OF THOSE OPTIONS MAYBE WOULD COME THROUGH THE RANKING.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00123	AND AGAIN I'M JUST GIVING YOU ALL OF THE PRIORITIES THAT WE PUT THERE AND I WILL JUST LEAVE THEM ON AND IF YOU CAN JUST REALLY QUICKLY LOOK AT THOSE OPTIONS THAT YOU'VE JUST DONE AND RANK THEM AGAINST THOSE DIFFERENT METRICS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00125	OKAY SO NOW MAYBE ONE OF THE MOST PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT THINGS IS TO LIST OUR KEY UNCERTAINTIES
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00126	AND SO THE IDEA IS THAT IF YOU'VE ACTUALLY GONE THROUGH THIS WORKSHOP WITH ME AND YOU'VE DONE AS I'VE SAID THEN YOU CAN GET TO THE POINT NOW WHERE YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN THINKING IN THE LAST STAGES LIKE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00127	WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT WHAT ARE YOUR RESERVATIONS LIKE WHAT ARE REALLY HOLDING YOU BACK FROM BEING ABLE TO DO THAT INITIAL RANKING
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00128	AND FROM GENERATING THOSE IDEAS. AND THESE KEY UNCERTAINTIES ACTUALLY ARE QUITE SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00129	THEY CAN CHANGE THE ENTIRE DIMENSION OF EVERYTHING YOU'VE JUST BEEN DOING SO YOU CAN THINK ABOUT THINGS AND THINK OKAY WE I'VE GOT A REALLY CONCRETE RANKING BUT WHAT ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS WHAT ARE THE KEY UNCERTAINTIES THAT YOU HAVE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00130	THAT WOULD ACTUALLY LIKELY CHANGE THE INITIAL RANKINGS THAT YOU'VE DONE SO AGAIN JUST LIKE TRYING TO THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS IS ACTUALLY REALLY IMPORTANT AND I AM GOING TO PAUSE NOW FOR FIVE MINUTES AND LET YOU THINK
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00131	REALLY CONCRETELY ABOUT THOSE STEPS AND THEN AFTER THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO INTO BREAKOUT ROOMS WHICH MARTIN'S GONNA HELP ME TO ASSIGN AND JUST TO WE'RE GONNA PUT YOU IN DIFFERENT GROUPS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00132	UM DEPENDING ON ON WHERE YOU GET ASSIGNED YOU WILL HAVE A KIND OF LIKE AN ASSIGNMENT FOR THAT BUT IF WE CAN SPEND FIVE MINUTES NOW INDIVIDUALLY JUST THINKING ABOUT ALL THESE THINGS UM AND I WILL LEAVE SOME TIPS ON THE SCREEN AGAIN UM SO THAT YOU CAN YOU CAN HAVE SOME TIME TO THINK
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00134	WELCOME BACK SO SORRY FOR THE MESSABLE LAUREN IT WAS NOT AS EASY AS I THOUGHT I COULD NOT GET ALL THE INFORMATION IN THE BROADCAST SO IT TOOK ME SOME TIME TO FIGURE IT OUT BUT I HOPE IT WAS DELIVERED
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00135	AS WELL. I HOPE IT WAS AS USUAL AS I GOT TO SPEAK TO SOMEONE AND SHE WAS QUITE FANTASTIC SO I HOPE EVERYONE ELSE HAD A GOOD TIME.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00136	CAN I JUST CHECK THAT CAN YOU SEE MY SCREEN OR NOT BECAUSE I'M NOT 100% SURE AT THIS POINT
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00137	WE CAN SEE YOU BUT NOT YOUR SCREEN YOU HAVE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00138	OKAY WELL PASSED
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00139	That's slightly unhelpful. Okay, anyway, I've got it, I think. I don't think I have the access anymore to share it, but anyway,
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00140	I THINK WE'RE JUST GOING TO MOVE OVER TO THE Q&A SESSION AND I JUST WANTED TO SAY BEFORE WE DID THAT
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00141	THAT HOPEFULLY PEOPLE HAVE FOUND THE THE WORKSHOP REALLY USEFUL AND
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00142	OR MARGINALLY USEFUL AND GOT SOMETHING OUT OF IT UM I JUST WANTED TO TO SAY THAT WE DO HAVE MORE RESOURCES AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE AND WE ALSO HAVE UH TWO THINGS THAT PEOPLE CAN DO FOLLOWING THIS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00143	SO ONE IS APPLY FOR OUR ONE TO ONE CAREER ADVISING CALLS AND THAT PEOPLE WILL FILL IN AN APPLICATION PROCESS WHICH SEEMS QUITE ARDUOUS AND LONG BUT IT ACTUALLY HELPED
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00144	TO TRY AND IS ACTUALLY DEVELOPED TO TRY AND GET PEOPLE TO INTERESPECT A LITTLE BIT AND TO THINK THROUGH THEIR CAREER AND THEN WE CAN USE THAT AS A FORM FOR FOR THE CALL AS WELL.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00145	AND THEN THE SECOND IS THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE DOING AN INTRODUCTORY COURSE AT THE END OF THIS, WELL ACTUALLY IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS TIME AND THAT IS JUST TO HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE EFFECTIVE ANIMAL
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00146	EFFECTIVE MOVEMENT AND THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE AND THEN WE WILL DO A MORE STRUCTURED AND DETAILED WORKSHOP THAN THE ONE THAT YOU HAD TODAY SO YOU CAN ALSO APPLY FOR THAT ON OUR
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00147	WE WILL HAVE THAT ON OUR WEBSITE BUT I THINK THAT'S PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING FROM MY SIDE IF WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS THAT WE CAN FIRE AWAY IT'S TOTALLY FINE.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00149	GREAT THANK YOU LAUREN SO NOW WE CAN OPEN Q&A SESSION WE HAVE 12 MINUTES OR ALMOST 12 MINUTES I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND YOU TO NOT ASK THE QUESTION DIRECTLY KEEP YOUR MIC MUTED
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00150	AND POST YOUR QUESTIONS TO SLIDO YOU SHOULD FIND THE LINK TO SLIDO IN THE CHAT AND IT WILL BE PUT THERE AGAIN IN A FEW MOMENTS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00151	AND WE ALREADY HAVE TWO QUESTIONS THERE SO LET'S START WITH THE FIRST QUESTION HI IS IT POSSIBLE TO WORK AS AN INDEPENDENT RESEARCHER WITHIN EAA
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00152	LIKE APPLYING FOR FUNDING TO DO RESEARCH PROJECTS AS AN INDIVIDUAL INDIVIDUAL RATHER THAN WITH AN ORGANIZATION
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00154	I'M REALLY SORRY COULD YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION I PROMISE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00155	OKAY, SORRY ABOUT THAT SO IS IT POSSIBLE TO WORK AS AN INDEPENDENT RESEARCHER WITHIN THE EFFECTIVE ANIMAL ADVOCACY?
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00156	THAT MEANS APPLYING FOR FUNDING TO DO RESEARCH PROJECTS AS AN INDIVIDUAL RATHER THAN WITH AN ORGANIZATION
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00158	FOR INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS. I THINK THAT WOULD DEFINITELY BE A POTENTIAL OPTION. I THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME FUNDING RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS. I THINK IT WOULD REALLY
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00159	SPECIFICALLY DEPEND ON WHAT PROJECT IT WAS THAT YOU WERE TRYING TO RESEARCH UM BUT THERE ARE DEFINITELY SOME SOME GRANT MAKING BODIES AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT WILL FUND INDIVIDUALS TO TO RESEARCH
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00160	PARTICULARLY ON PRIORITY AREAS I THINK THE EFFECTIVE ANIMAL THE EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVISM
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00161	COMMUNITY DOES USUALLY FUND THESE THINGS I'VE HEARD OF PEOPLE YOU KNOW I HOPE THAT ANSWERS THE QUESTION BUT IF YOU HAVE A FOLLOW-UP FEEL FREE TO ASK
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00163	OKAY NEXT QUESTION FROM HAVEN WHAT WAS YOUR CAREER PATH BEFORE LAUNCHING THIS NEW COOL ORGANIZATION
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00164	THANKS HAVEN UH YEAH SO MY CAREER PATH BEFORE BEFORE THIS IS I I'VE WORKED IN THE FOR-PROFIT WORLD FOR UM ALMOST 10 YEARS BEFORE I DID THIS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00165	AND I WORKED AS A CLIENT MANAGER AND THEN ENDED UP IN CONSULTANCY AND WHEN I WAS DOING THAT I WAS ALSO VOLUNTEERING
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00166	FOR EFFECTIVE ANIMAL ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE HUMANE LEAGUE AND THE GOOD FOOD INSTITUTE AND I REALLY ENJOYED THAT WORK THAT WAS POTENTIALLY THE MOST EXCITING PART OF MY JOB EVEN THOUGH IT WASN'T MY JOB
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00167	AND THAT INSPIRED ME TO START CHARITY ENTREPRENEURSHIP WHICH I THINK YOU WERE ALSO ON AND THEN I STARTED THIS ORGANIZATION
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00169	IS VERY IMPORTANT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. TH
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00171	AND YEAH THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S A MOST BUT I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00172	ANYBODY WHO KIND OF WANTS TO THINK A LITTLE BIT MORE IN A STRUCTURED WAY ABOUT THEIR CAREER
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00173	AND THE ACTUAL APPLICATION FORM ITSELF IS QUITE LONG. SORRY ABOUT THAT. BUT IT IS THERE TO TRY AND HELP TO GET PEOPLE TO REALLY THINK ABOUT THEIR CAREER.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00174	AND IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL I THINK FOR ANYBODY WHO IS UNCERTAIN ABOUT ANY ASPECT OF THEIR CAREER AND WOULD JUST LIKE TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT IT
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00175	AND WE CAN GIVE YOU FEEDBACK ON IT AND HOPEFULLY GIVE YOU SOME MORE TAILORED AND INDIVIDUAL RESOURCES TO HELP YOU WITH YOUR CAREER DECISIONS.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00177	THANK YOU. NEXT QUESTION IS FROM MATILDE DARUI. I APOLOGIZE IF I MISPRONOUNCE THAT. DO YOU HAVE ANY POINTERS ON HOW TO GET HOW TO GO ABOUT ASSESSING RELATIVE FITNESS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00179	OH ASSESSING RELATIVE FIT UH YEAH I MEAN I THINK I THINK THAT REALLY I THINK THAT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO IN ASSESSING YOUR RELATIVE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00180	FIT IS TO BE QUITE BRUTAL WITH YOURSELF AND INTRO SPECT A LOT AND YOU COULD ALSO ASK OTHER INDIVIDUALS I KNOW SOME PEOPLE START THOSE ANONYMOUS FEEDBACK FORMS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00181	AND I KNOW BOTH OF MY FRIENDS HAVE ACTUALLY IF YOU'RE THE KIND OF PERSON THAT CAN TAKE FEEDBACK I DON'T WANT TO ADVISE ANYONE TO TRY AND GET FEEDBACK IF IT'S GOING TO AFFECT THEM NEGATIVELY IN THEIR MENTAL HEALTH
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00182	BUT IT CAN BE QUITE USEFUL TO ACTUALLY ASK PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW TO GIVE YOU TO GIVE YOU FEEDBACK SO THAT YOU CAN REALLY GET A BETTER
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00183	OBJECTIVE VIEW OF YOUR SPECIFIC SKILL SETS AND THEN YOU CAN QUITE ACCURATELY PROBABLY ASSESS YOUR RELATIVE FIT ANOTHER THING THAT YOU CAN DO IS DO SOME VOLUNTEERING
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00184	FOR SPECIFIC ROLES THAT YOU'RE CONSIDERING AND THAT WILL GIVE YOU A PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF WHETHER YOU WOULD LIKE OR NOT LIKE THOSE ROLES I DID VOLUNTEER ONCE AS A RESEARCHER AND
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00185	I DIDN'T IT DIDN'T FIT VERY WELL WITH ME SO I'M REALLY GLAD I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR MY CO-FOUNDER JAMIE WHO DOES THE THE MORE ARDUOUS SIDE OF RESEARCH BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THAT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00186	A VERY GOOD FIT FOR ME AND PRIOR TO THAT I THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE BEEN A FANTASTIC RESEARCHER SO VOLUNTEERING CAN BE VERY HELPFUL FOR THAT
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00188	THANK YOU I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND OTHERS THAT IN SLIDO YOU CAN VOTE FOR THE QUESTIONS YOU FIND MOST INTERESTING IT IS THE PREFERRED WAY OF DOING THIS BECAUSE WE HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS AND ONLY SEVEN MINUTES LEFT
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00189	SO WE WON'T BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THEM THE NEXT QUESTION IS IF YOU WANT TO WORK IN A PLANT-BASED CAMPAIGNING ON INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00190	WHAT KIND OF UNIVERSITY DEGREE WOULD BE USEFUL OR WHAT SKILLS WOULD BE USEFUL TO LEARN
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00192	THAT? YEAH, THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION AND VERY SPECIFIC. I DON'T THINK THAT I WOULD BE THE BEST PERSON TO ASK THAT FOR BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE THAT BACKGROUND. SO FOR ME TO KIND OF LIKE ANSWER THAT QUESTION WOULD PROBABLY BE MISDIRECTED.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00193	AND I THINK THAT IF YOU WERE TO USE THE COMMUNITY DIRECTORY WHICH I THINK I REFERENCED BEFORE THERE WILL PROBABLY BE SOMEBODY WHO ACTUALLY SPECIFICALLY WORKS IN THAT SPACE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00194	AND CAN PROBABLY TELL YOU ABOUT THEIR CAREER TRAJECTORY AND HOW THEY GOT THERE AND WHICH ONES ARE MORE USEFUL THAN OTHER ONES.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00196	ARE MORE MORE USEFUL THAN THAT.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00198	OKAY THANK YOU LET'S GET TO THE NEXT ONE DO YOU HAVE ANY TIPS FOR HOW TO CHEAPLY EXPLORE SOCIAL SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH RELATED TO EFFECTIVE ANIMAL ADVOCACY AND ALTERNATIVE PROTEIN STARTUPS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00200	AGAIN THAT'S A VERY SPECIFIC QUESTION I DON'T REALLY HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT I'M REALLY SORRY UM BUT I THINK LIKE THE THE GENERAL THING WOULD BE THAT IF YOU HAVE A REALLY REALLY SPECIFIC QUESTION ABOUT UM A PARTICULAR CAREER
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00201	UM ROLE I WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO REACH OUT TO SOMEBODY WHO HAS GOT A BACKGROUND IN THAT BECAUSE THEY WILL HAVE THE THE BEST ADVICE UM AND UNFORTUNATELY AS A NEW ORGANIZATION WE'VE ONLY BEEN GOING FOR LIKE A YEAR
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00202	WE HAVE ONLY RESEARCHED INTO A SPECIFIC AREA AT THE MOMENT AND OVERALL CAREER STRATEGY AND VERY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS WOULD PROBABLY BE BETTER DIRECTED
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00203	TO SOMEONE WHO HAS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EXPERIENCE IN A SPECIFIC ROLE.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00205	OKAY THANK YOU NEXT QUESTION HOW LENGTHY IS THE PROCESS INVOLVED IN IMPLYING FOR INDIVIDUAL CAREER COUNSELING CALLS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00207	SORRY COULD YOU JUST REPEAT THAT
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00208	HOW LENGTHY IS THE PROCESS INVOLVED IN APPLYING FOR INDIVIDUAL CAREER COUNSELLING GOALS?
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00209	IT'S A 50-50% CHANCE THAT YOU WILL GET ON TO THE CAREER ADVISING CALL. THE REASON IS SO THAT WE CAN ACCURATELY ASSESS WHETHER IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN USEFUL FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE CAREER ADVISING
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00210	THIS YEAR SO YOU IT'S IT'S NOT BASED ON THE ACTUAL APPLICATION ITSELF IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S A GOOD OR BAD THERE IS NO GOOD OR BAD IN THE APPLICATION IT'S IT'S LITERALLY RANDOM CHANCE SO
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00211	IT'S NOT BASED ON THE ACTUAL APPLICATION IT'S LITERALLY RANDOM CHANCE SO THE FIRST PERSON WILL GET EITHER ASSIGNED TO JAMIE OR MYSELF FOR A CAREER ADVISING CALL
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00212	AND THE SECOND PERSON WILL BE ASSIGNED TO A CONTROL TRIAL. IT'S NOT LIKE AN APPLICATION WHERE YOU CAN GET A GOOD OR A BAD RESULT
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00214	OKAY NEXT QUESTION
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00216	Do the individual calls assume that applicants have decided to prioritize animal advocacy as a cause area or can you talk about prioritization in the calls? No, you can definitely talk about prioritization.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00217	LIKE TO DISCUSS THOSE OPTIONS WITH PEOPLE BUT I DON'T THINK THAT
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00218	IF YOU HAVEN'T DECIDED 100 ON ANIMAL EFFICACY I I THINK THAT IT WOULD STILL BE VERY INTERESTING TO HAVE THAT DIALOGUE UM AND YOU CAN USE THE SAME TYPE OF FRAMEWORK UM USUALLY
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00219	FOR ASSESSING ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF OPTIONS THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE SPECIFIC TO ANIMAL ADVOCACY
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00221	THANK YOU. NEXT QUESTION IS FROM JONATHAN. HOW IS THE CAREER COALS EXPERIMENT GOING? WHEN DO YOU EXPECT TO HAVE AN IDEA ON HOW EFFECTIVE THE COACHING IS AND WHETHER YOU WILL CONTINUE WITH IT?
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00222	IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION JONATHAN UM IT'S GOING REALLY IT'S GOING WELL AT THE MOMENT I'M UM I THINK
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00223	I MEAN AGAIN IT'S THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT I'M SURE AS YOU KNOW BY POSING THAT QUESTION IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO UH TO GET RESULTS BACK STRAIGHT AWAY
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00224	AND AT THE MOMENT WE'VE HAD QUITE A LOT OF POSITIVE FEEDBACK AND BUT WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE DOING IS ASSESSING INCREMENTAL CHANGES THAT PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE HAVE MADE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00225	BASED ON THE CALLS. IT'S LIKELY THAT WE WILL GET INITIAL RESULTS AFTER ABOUT SIX MONTHS AFTER THE CALLS.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00226	AND IT'LL BE TWO TO THREE YEARS BEFORE WE'LL REALLY SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERSTAND
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00227	WHETHER WE'VE HAD ANY IMPACT OR NOT WHICH IS WHY IT'S ONLY ONE OF THE FEW THINGS THAT WE'RE EXPERIMENTING IN THIS YEAR.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00229	THANK YOU
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00231	Next question is from Andrea. How should we find a job in animal rights research if there aren't so many open vacancies?
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00233	REALLY GOOD QUESTION I THINK AS I SAID WHEN WE WERE ACTUALLY DOING OUR SPOT CHECK AND RESEARCH
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00234	IT DOES SEEM THAT SOME RULES ARE A LOT MORE COMPETITIVE THAN OTHER ONES AND RESEARCH IS DEFINITELY ONE OF THEM
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00235	AND CAMPAIGNING IS ANOTHER. SO IN THAT SITUATION THERE'S JUST A LOT OF PEOPLE AND THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ROLES.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00236	AND WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST WOULD BE TO WORK ON THE GENERATING OPTIONS IDEA BECAUSE IT COULD BE THAT IF LONG TERM YOU WANT TO DO RESEARCH
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00237	AND THAT'S DEFINITELY STILL A PLAUSIBLE PATH BUT IT MIGHT JUST BE THAT AT THE MOMENT INITIALLY THERE AREN'T THE RESEARCH ROLES AVAILABLE SO I WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK INTO OTHER OPTIONS THAT YOU HAVE MORE IMMEDIATELY
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00238	OPTIONS THAT CAN HELP YOU GET TOWARDS THAT GOAL.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00239	AT THE END AND NOT FOCUS TOO MUCH ON NOT GETTING SPECIFIC OPPORTUNITIES RIGHT NOW.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00241	THANK YOU AND WE HAVE TIME FOR ONE LAST QUESTION AND WE HAVE ONLY ONE LAST QUESTION IN SLIDER SO THIS IS THE FORTUNATE THE LAST QUESTION IS WHAT DO YOU ENVISION ANIMAL ADVOCACY CAREERS ARE DOING IN FIVE YEARS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00243	THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION THAT'S A REALLY REALLY GOOD QUESTION AND THEN YOU GET THE EASY ANSWER TO THAT WOULD BE DOING THE MOST IMPACTFUL THING THAT WE CAN TO HELP INDIVIDUALS MAXIMIZE THEIR IMPACT FOR ANIMALS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00244	AND THE THE SLIGHTLY HARDER QUESTION ANSWER WOULD BE THAT I REALLY DON'T KNOW THAT'S WHY WE'RE TESTING DIFFERENT THINGS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00245	AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND EXPERIMENTING ON A SMALL SCALE SO WE CAN TRY AND WORK OUT HOW WE'RE HELPING HOW WE CAN HELP INDIVIDUALS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00246	AND SO AS MUCH FEEDBACK WOULD BE GRAPEFULLY ACCEPTED WHETHER IT'S POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE IT HELPS US TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN THE LONG TERM
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00248	OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH LAUREN WE ARE OUT OF QUESTIONS AND OUT OF TIME I THINK FOR THE REST OF US IT'S TIME TO UNMUTE OURSELVES AND GIVE LAUREN A SHORT RUN ROUND OF
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00250	AWW THANK YOU THAT'S REALLY NICE I WASN'T EXPECTING IT
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00002	Welcome to the CADFA Medical Conference 2021 from me. I'm Jan Hertwig, the CEO of CADFA Medical, and I'm very happy that so many participants joined here today.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00003	AND I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ALL THE PARTICIPANTS AND SPEAKERS THAT HAVE JOINED
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00004	SO WE'RE NOW LOOKING FORWARD TO A VERY EXCITING AFTERNOON WITH GREAT PRESENTATIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL MODELING IN MEDICINE AND MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY AND IN SILICONE METHODS IN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY PLEASE ENJOY
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00006	FOR THE OPENING OF THE CATFIRM MEDICAL CONFERENCE 2021 I WILL INVITE YOU TO A SHORT LOOK ON WHAT WE DO AND ACHIEVE WITH OUR PARTNERS AT CATFIRM MEDICAL
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00007	SO AT CADFEM MEDICAL OUR VISION IS TO BE THE NUMBER ONE ENABLER FOR IN SILICON MEDICINE WE WANT TO PROVIDE PHYSICIANS AND PATIENTS ACCESS TO IN SILICON METHODS
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00008	SO WITH OUR MISSION TO TRANSFER SIMULATION TECHNOLOGIES FROM AUTOMOTIVE AND AEROSPACE TO HEALTHCARE WE WANT TO ENHANCE THE WELL BEING OF PATIENTS
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00009	SO TO DO SO WE DEEPLY BELIEVE IN THE USE OF NUMERICAL SIMULATION TO DETECT DISEASES IMPROVE THERAPIES AND ENHANCE THE PRODUCT SAFETY OF MEDICAL DEVICES
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00010	ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS HAS THEIR ROOTS IN RESEARCH PROJECTS AND WITH ACADEMIA AND UNIVERSITIES
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00011	SO FOR EXAMPLE DOCU RPE FOR THE SURGICAL PLANNING OF FIRST MOXILLA EXPANSIONS DEVELOPED TOGETHER WITH CLINICUM DORTMUND KALIS MARTIN AND THE UNIVERSITY OF WHITNEY HADDICK
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00012	AND ALSO DOCQ ALSO FOR THE DIAGNOSIS AND THERAPY OF OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP ADNIA IT'S ALSO AN UNIVERSAL UM AND GRANT-FUNDED UH RESEARCH PROJECT
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00013	AND DOCUVIT FOR THE DIGITAL VERIFICATION OF CUSTOM IMPLANTS ALSO SO ALL OUR PRODUCTS ARE BASED ON ON RESEARCH AND UNIVERSAL RESEARCH TO TEST AND TO REALLY UM VERIFY OUR MODELS AND OUR IDEAS
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00015	AND TO BRING THESE INNOVATIONS FROM ACADEMIA AND RESEARCH TO INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS WE DEVELOP DOCQ SO OUR SCALABLE AND SILICO PLATFORM ENABLING DOCTORS AND MEDTECH USE ANSYS SIMULATION TECHNOLOGIES IN PRE-DEFINED MEDICAL WORKFLOWS
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00016	SO EVERY SPECIFIC MEDICAL QUESTION IS ALWAYS TRANSFERRED INTO A SO-CALLED DOCUMODULE SO THE BLUE CUBE YOU CAN SEE IN THE MIDDLE
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00017	AND EACH MODULE IS A PRODUCT WITH A SPECIFIC INTENDED USE WHICH THEN CAN OPERATE AUTONOMOUS TOGETHER WITH THE PLATFORM DOCQ CORE IN GREEN
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00018	SO THROUGH OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH MICROSOFT WE ARE DELIVERING A VERY SCALABLE INFRASTRUCTURE ENABLING UNRESTRICTED AND EASY TO USE ACCESS TO OUR PRODUCTS AND ANSWER SOLVERS IN VERIFIED INFRASTRUCTURES ON AZURE
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00019	AND TO GIVE A BETTER IDEA OF HOW WE USE NUMERICAL SIMULATION TO ADD VALUE I WILL SHOW YOU SOME EXAMPLES AND BENEFITS OF THE MODULES BASED ON OUR DOCU PLATFORM
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00021	FIRST OF ALL DOCQ OSA TO SUPPORT THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA AND SLEEP RELATED BREATHING DISORDERS
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00022	SO IT SUPPORTS THE DIAGNOSIS AND THERAPY WITH COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS AND FLUID STRUCTURE INTERACTION
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00023	WITH DOCUOSATE IT IS POSSIBLE FOR A PHYSICIAN TO VISUALIZE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF AN UPPER AIRWAY AND DETERMINE THE ANATOMICAL AND BIOMECANICAL CAUSES AND THE AREA OF THE RESPIRATORY PROBLEM FOR A PATIENT
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00024	REALLY OBJECTIFYING THE ROOT CAUSES AND APPROVE THE COMMUNICATION OF THE TREATMENT OPTIONS TO THE PATIENT
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00025	AND CURRENTLY WE ARE IN A PATIENT STUDY WITH OVER 60 PATIENTS TOGETHER WITH OUR CLINICAL PARTNER CLINIC IN DORTMUND AND WE'RE AIMING FOR CE MARK IN EARLY 2023
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00027	YEARS NOW SO WE'RE IN A PATIENT STUDY WITH OUR CLINIC IN DORTMUND AND WE'RE AIMING FOR C MARK IN EARLY TWENTY THREE THE NEXT EXAMPLE IS DOC URPE THE NEXT EXAMPLE IS DOC URPE IT'S A SOFTWARE FOR SURGICAL IT'S A SOFTWARE FOR SURGICAL PLANNING OF SO-CALLED FORCED FORCED FORCED MAXILLARY DISTRACTIONS SO IT MAXILLARY DISTRACTIONS SO IT CALCULATES THE OPTIMAL CUTTING
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00028	SYMMETRICAL PHASE AFTER AND DURING THE FORCED WIDENING OF THE UPPER JAW SO THE PROBLEM WITH THIS PROCEDURE IS VERY SIMPLE SO NEARLY EVERYONE HAS A SYMMETRICAL OR ASYMMETRICAL ANATOMY
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00029	SO MANY DIFFERENT BONE THICKNESSES IN THE SKULL FOR THE FORCED OPENING OF THE UPPER JAW A SO-CALLED DISTRACTOR IS POSITIONED IN THE UPPER JAW AND APPLIES A SYMMETRICAL FORCE ONTO THE BONE PARTS
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00030	AND SYMMETRIC BONE WEAKENING CUTS WILL BE INTRODUCED IN THE MEXELLA NORMALLY AND LEFT AND RIGHT WITH THE SAME LENGTH SO THIS CAN RESULT IN AN ASYMMETRIC OPENING OF THE MEXELLA MEANING ONE SIDE OF THE UPPER JAW MOVES MORE THAN THE OPPOSITE SIDE
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00031	SO WITH DOCURPE KALIS MARTIN CAN CALCULATE THE OPTIMAL CUTTING PATTERNS AND GENERATE A CUTTING GUIDE FOR THE SURGEON SO THEY CAN RELY ON CONSISTENT QUALITY OF PATIENT CARE AND THE BEST SURGICAL OUTCOMES
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00033	AND THE BEST SURGICAL OUTCOMES AND THE BEST SURGICAL OUTCOMES AND THE BEST SURGICAL OUTCOMES AND THE BEST SURGICAL OUTCOMES AND THE BEST SURGICAL OUTCOMES AND THE BEST SURGICAL OUTCOMES AND THE BEST SURGICAL OUTCOMES AND THE BEST SURGICAL OUTCOMES AND THE BEST SURGICAL OUTCOMES AND THE BEST SURGICAL OUTCOMES AND THE BEST SURGICAL OUTCOMES AND THE BEST SURGICAL OUTCOMES AND THE BEST SURGICAL OUTCOMES AND THE BEST SURGICAL OUTCOMES AND THE BEST SURGICAL OUTCOMES AND THE BEST SURGICAL OUTCOMES AND THE BEST SURGICAL OUTCOMES AND THE BEST SURGICAL OUTCOMES AND THE BEST SURGICAL OUTCOMES AND THE BEST SURGICAL OUTCOMES AND THE BEST
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00034	IS THERE IS A POSSIBILITY TO INDIVIDUALIZE AN OFF THE SHELF MEDICAL DEVICE
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00035	SO, K-LESS MARKING CAN GIVE AN ADDED VALUE BY SELLING A HYBRID PRODUCT, A STANDARDIZED HARDWARE PRODUCT PLUS A PERSONALIZED DIGITAL PLANNING WITH SIMULATION.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00037	AND WITH THE THIRD EXAMPLE COMING FROM ACADEMIA
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00038	DOCUVIT VIT STANDS FOR VIRTUAL IMPLANT TESTING WE WANT TO HELP AND MAKE MEDICAL DEVICES SAFER
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00039	SO WE SAW A BIG TREND IN PERSONALIZED PERSONALIZATION OF MEDICAL DEVICES AND IF MEDICAL DEVICES ARE PERSONALIZED THEY ARE UNIQUE AND PRODUCED JUST ONCE SO THAT MEANS THEY CANNOT BE TESTED LIKE STANDARD MEDICAL DEVICES
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00040	SO IN THE PRODUCTION PROCESS OF THESE CUSTOM IMPLANT
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00041	USUALLY THEY ACQUIRE PATIENT DATA DO A SURGICAL PLANNING TOGETHER WITH A DOCTOR VIA WEB MEETING DO AN IMPLANT DESIGN BY A DESIGNER OR IN A POC SO POINT OF CARE CENTER IN THE CLINIC
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00042	AND THEN DO THE IMPLANT MANUFACTURING WITH MILLING 3D PRINTING ETC AND A POST PROCESSING STEPS
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00043	AND SENDING IT TO SURGERY NORMALLY THAT HAPPENS WITHIN TWO TO EIGHT DAYS FROM DATA ACQUISITION TO SENDING THE RESULTS
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00044	AND THERE IS ALREADY A LOT OF QUALITY MANAGEMENT NECESSARY IN THE MANUFACTURING AND THE POST PROCESSING AND A LOT OF QUALITY MANAGEMENT AND HAS TO GET INTO TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00045	BUT WHERE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND WHERE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF A DEVICE FOR A PATIENT IS DETERMINED IT'S IN THE SURGICAL PLANNING AND THE IMPLANT DESIGN BUT THERE'S NO POSSIBILITY TO TEST YOUR DEVICES FOR EACH PATIENT
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00046	AND THERE DOCUVIT COMES IN SO WE DEVELOPED TO FILL THIS GAP DOCUVIT AND DIGITAL DESIGN VERIFICATION AND AN AUTOMATED REPORTING OF THE RESULTS FOR THE TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00048	SO IN A NUTSHELL DOCQ V I T IS AN EASY TO USE SOFTWARE FOR DIGITAL VERIFICATION OF CUSTOM EMPLOYMENTS
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00049	AND WE CAN APPLY PHYSIOLOGICAL AND STANDARDIZED LOADS TO PATIENT SPECIFIC SITUATIONS AND PATIENT SPECIFIC IMPLANTS AND REDUCE THE LIABILITY BASED ON OBJECTIVE CRITERIA
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00050	AND ENSURE THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY WITH HIGHLY COMPLEX BIOMECANICAL SIMULATIONS SO AT THE MOMENT WORKFLOWS ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE MAXILLA THE MANDIBLE THE TORAX AND SOON FOR THE LOWER ARMS
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00052	AND WHAT THAT MADE MADE HAPPEN IS REALLY RESEARCH AND AND A LOT OF EFFORT AND IN OUR PLATFORM
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00053	DOCU WE WANT TO REALLY PROVIDE AN ECOSYSTEM FOR IN SILICO TECHNOLOGIES AND FOR ACADEMIA AND OTHER COMPANIES SO WE DO NOT
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00055	WANT THE COMPANIES AND ACADEMIA DO NOT REINVENT THE WHEEL
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00056	BECAUSE DOCUSE PROVIDING ALREADY A SCALABILITY A WORKING INFRASTRUCTURE THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THE BASE TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS ANZUS SOLDIERS 3D RENDERING DICOM AND DATA HANDLING USER MANAGEMENT ETC ETC
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00057	AND WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE GREAT IDEAS AND SOLUTIONS BEING DEVELOPED IN RESEARCH AND INDUSTRY AND TOGETHER WE CAN FURTHER DEVELOP THEM AND MAKE THEM AVAILABLE FOR PATIENTS AND DOCTORS
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00059	SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION AND A BIG THANK YOU TO OUR PARTNERS SPEAKERS AND PANELISTS TODAY AND FEEL FREE TO CONTACT US AND PLEASE ENJOY THE AFTERNOON THANK YOU VERY MUCH
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00001	I welcome you to this presentation entitled Citizen Attitudes Towards Genome Editing in Farm Animals.
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00003	WE ASKED AROUND 3700 CITIZENS FROM AUSTRIA, CANADA, GERMANY, ITALY AND THE US ON THIS TOPIC AND WE COLLECTED OUR DATA ONLINE BETWEEN MAY AND NOVEMBER 2019
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00004	OUR FIRST RESEARCH QUESTION IS ARE DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS OF GENOME EDITING RIGHT OR WRONG TO DO FROM A CITIZEN'S PERSPECTIVE
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00005	WE INCLUDED FIVE DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS OF GENOME EDITING IN THE STUDY. THREE OF THEM REFER TO DISEASE RESISTANCE WITHIN DIFFERENT SPECIES.
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00006	NAMELY HIV RESISTANCE IN HUMANS, MILDEW RESISTANCE IN WEED PLANTS AND RESISTANCE TO PURSE IN PIGS
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00007	THE OTHER TWO APPLICATIONS REFER TO EDITING CATTLE TO PRODUCE ALLOGEN FREE MILK AND TO INCREASE MUSCLE GROWTH IN CATTLE
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00009	EACH STUDY PARTICIPANT WAS RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO ONE OF THE FIVE APPLICATIONS AND READ A SHORT INTRODUCTORY TEXT ABOUT GENOME EDITING AND THE SPECIFIC APPLICATION
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00011	THIS FIGURE SHOWS HOW PARTICIPANTS RESPONDED TO THE QUESTION WHETHER THEY THINK IT IS RIGHT OR WRONG TO USE GENOME EDITING FOR THE APPLICATION THEY JUST READ ABOUT
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00012	ANSWERS COULD BE GIVEN ON A 7 POINT LICUD SCALE RANGING FROM 1 ABSOLUTELY WRONG TO DO UP TO 7 ABSOLUTELY RIGHT TO DO
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00014	THE APPLICATION BEING THE MOST RIGHT TO DO IS THE HIV RESISTANCE IN HUMANS FOLLOWED BY MALDEU RESISTANCE IN WHEAT PLANTS
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00015	THE THREE APPLICATIONS DEALING WITH EDITING FARM ANIMALS ARE PERCEIVED AS BEING LESS RIGHT IN THE ORDER OF RESISTANCE IN PIGS TOWARDS PURSES EDITING CATTLE TO PRODUCE ALLERGINE-FREE MILK
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00016	AND THE INCREASED MUSCLE GROWTH IN CATTLE IS PERCEIVED AS WRONG ON AVERAGE.
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00017	THE ORDER OF APPLICATIONS IS THE SAME IN ALL COUNTRIES WHEREAS WE OBSERVE THE GERMAN AND AUSTRIAN PARTICIPANTS BEING A BIT MORE SKEPTICAL COMPARED TO THE OTHER COUNTRIES
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00019	OUR SECOND RESEARCH QUESTION WAS WHETHER WE CAN FIND DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PARTICIPANTS ACCORDING TO THEIR ATTITUDES TOWARDS GENOME EDITING
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00021	INDEED WE WERE ABLE TO FIND FOUR DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PARTICIPANTS THE STRONG SUPPORTERS HERE IN DARK GREEN THINK THAT GENOME EDITING IS RIGHT TO DO THEY PERCEIVE LITTLE RISKS
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00022	HIGH BENEFITS AND DO NOT THINK THAT THE TECHNOLOGY IS TEMPERING WITH NATURE THE OPPONENTS IN RED THINK THAT GENOME EDITING IS REALLY WRONG TO DO THEY PERCEIVE HIGH RISKS
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00023	LOW BENEFITS AND THINK THAT IT'S TEMPERING WITH NATURE THE OTHER TWO CLUSTERS ARE IN BETWEEN THESE TWO GROUPS
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00025	THE RESULTS OF THE CLUSTER ANALYSIS SHOW THAT THEY ARE QUITE DIVERSE GROUPS OF PEOPLE WITH REGARD TO THEIR ATTITUDES TO GENOME EDITING
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00027	THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LISTENING AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS AND PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME FOR THIS
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00002	Hi, my name is Coleman Stavish and I'm the Chief Technology Officer at Procia, a software company in the field of cancer research and diagnostics.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00003	TODAY I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT HOW AWS PROSCIA AND THE JOINT PATHOLOGY CENTER HAVE JOINT FORCES TO ADVANCE THE PRACTICE OF PATHOLOGY
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00005	IN TODAY'S SESSION I'LL INTRODUCE PROSCIA AND SHARE HOW OUR CONCENTRIC PLATFORM HELPS TO ADDRESS FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGES IN THE PATHOLOGY INDUSTRY WE'LL ALSO LOOK AT THE JOINT PATHOLOGY CENTER AND ITS TRAILBLAZING INITIATIVE IN DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00006	AND THROUGHOUT THE SESSION I'LL TOUCH ON HOW PARTNERSHIP WITH AWS MAKES ALL THIS POSSIBLE
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00008	PROCES MISSION IS TO PERFECT CANCER DIAGNOSIS WITH INTELLIGENCE SOFTWARE THAT CHANGES THE WAY THE WORLD PRACTICES
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00010	WE BUILT A SOFTWARE PLATFORM THAT SUPPORTS PATHOLOGY'S TRANSITION FROM ANALOG TO DIGITAL WHICH CAN ACCELERATE DISCOVERY AND LIFE SCIENCES RESEARCH AND IMPROVE CLINICAL OUTCOMES.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00012	PROSHA WAS FOUNDED IN 2014 AND IS BACKED BY A STRONG GROUP OF VENTURE CAPITAL AND STRATEGIC INVESTORS TODAY PROSHA'S PLATFORM IS TRUSTED BY LEADING BIO PHARMA COMPANIES CONTRACT RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS HOSPITAL SYSTEMS AND ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTERS
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00014	LET'S TAKE A STEP BACK BRIEFLY AND LOOK AT PATHOLOGY AS A FIELD
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00016	THIS IS AN IMAGE OF A PATHOLOGIST DESK
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00018	HUNDREDS OF GLASS SLIDES IN TRAYS, AWAITING REVIEW UNDER A MICROSCOPE, AND ANTIQUATED TECHNOLOGY. THIS FIELD OF MEDICINE HASN'T FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED IN OVER A CENTURY AND IS IN DIRE NEED OF A TRANSFORMATION.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00020	FURTHER THE PRACTICE OF PATHOLOGY IS INHERENTLY SUBJECTIVE
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00022	PATHOLOGIST CONCORDANCE CAN BE AS LOW AS 54%, WHICH MEANS IN SOME SENSITIVE AREAS OF DIAGNOSIS AND PROGNOSIS, TWO PATHOLOGISTS MAY DISAGREE WITH EACH OTHER ABOUT HALF THE TIME.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00023	WHAT THAT MEANS PRACTICALLY IS THAT A PATIENT COULD BE UNDERTREATED OR OVERTREATED BASED ON THAT DIAGNOSIS LEADING TO POTENTIALLY POOR OUTCOMES FOR THE PATIENT AND INCREASED COSTS OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00024	AT THE SAME TIME, PATHOLOGISTS AND THE LABS THEY WORK FOR ARE UNDER INTENSE ECONOMIC PRESSURE. GLOBALLY, LABS DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH STAFF TO MEET INCREASING DEMAND, WITH THE GLOBAL PATHOLOGIST WORKFORCE SHRINKING,
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00025	AND THE PATHOLOGIST WORKLOAD EXPLODING OVER THE PAST DECADE. AS A QUICK CHECKPOINT, IT'S SOMETIMES USEFUL TO COMPARE PATHOLOGY TO RADIOLOGY, WHICH UNDERWENT ITS OWN DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION TWO DECADES AGO OR SO.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00026	WHILE THERE ARE SOME PARALLELS BETWEEN THE TWO SPECIALTIES PATHOLOGY IMAGES ARE ON AVERAGE TEN TIMES LARGER AVERAGING TWO GIGABYTES PER IMAGE SOMETIMES AS LARGE AS 30 GIGABYTES OR MORE
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00027	OF COURSE THIS PRESENTS A CONSIDERABLE CHALLENGE FROM AN IT STANDPOINT ENSURING THAT STORAGE AND COMPUTE INFRASTRUCTURE CAN SCALE TO SUPPORT WHAT'S ON TRACK TO BECOME ONE OF THE MOST DATA INTENSIVE FIELDS OF MEDICINE
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00028	AWS AND ITS BROAD SOLUTION PORTFOLIO HAS BEEN AN EXCELLENT PARTNER TO PROSHA AND MANY CUSTOMERS PRACTICING DIGITAL PATHOLOGY AT SCALE
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00029	SCANNERS. POWERING PATHOLOGY SHIFT TO DIGITAL ARE THREE TECHNOLOGY PILLARS. FIRST, SLIDES ARE DIGITIZED USING WHOLE SLIDE SCANNERS WHICH TAKE A GLASS SLIDE AND PRODUCE A DIGITAL IMAGE FOR PATHOLOGY REVIEW
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00030	AND THOSE IMAGES ARE MANAGED IN AN IMAGE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00032	AND AFTER AN IMAGE IS CREATED, IT CAN BE ANALYZED BY ONE OR MORE COMPUTATIONAL APPLICATIONS OR ALGORITHMS INTENDED TO AID THE PATHOLOGIST OR SCIENTIST.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00034	PROSHA BUILDS THE IMAGE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM CONCENTRIC AND ALSO HAS A PORTFOLIO OF ADD ON APPLICATIONS
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00036	PROCHA'S CONCENTRIC PLATFORM LIVES AT THE CENTER OF THE PATHOLOGY ECOSYSTEM
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00038	CONCENTRIC RUNS NATIVELY ON AWS TO MANAGE ALL PATHOLOGY DATA IN THE CLOUD FOR HIGH SCALEABILITY WHILE KEEPING COSTS UNDER CONTROL.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00040	CONCENTRIC INTEGRATES WITH THIRD PARTY SOLUTIONS TO DELIVER A BEST IN CLASS EXPERIENCE FOR DIGITAL PATHOLOGY PULLING IMAGES IN FROM ANY SLIDE SCANNER AND PATIENT DATA FROM THE LABORATORY INFORMATION SYSTEM
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00042	CONCENTRIC PROVIDES PATHOLOGISTS WITH THEIR PORTAL FOR READING IMAGES AND RENDERING DIAGNOSES AND ENABLES INSTANT REMOTE CONSULTATION WITH EXPERTS AROUND THE WORLD
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00044	CONCENTRIC IS DESIGNED TO USE AWS OFFERINGS SUCH AS S3 OBJECT STORAGE WITH INTELLIGENT TEARING
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00046	RDS AND EC2 INSTANCES WITH AUTO SCALING TO SUPPORT THE HIGH AND SOMETIMES VARIABLE DEMANDS OF DIGITAL PATHOLOGY.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00048	NOW I'D LIKE TO SHIFT GEARS AND INTRODUCE THE JOINT PATHOLOGY CENTER WHICH IS THE PATHOLOGY CENTER OF EXCELLENCE FOR THE UNITED STATES MILITARY AND OTHER FEDERAL ENTITIES
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00050	THE JPC'S MISSION IS TWOFOLD FIRST TO DELIVER THE HIGHEST QUALITY PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION AND EDUCATION
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00051	AND EDUCATION AND SECOND TO GROW AND PRESERVE THE WORLD'S LARGEST TISSUE BIOREPOSITORY FOR BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH. AS THE STEWARD OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST HUMAN TISSUE BANK,
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00052	CONTAINING OVER 55 MILLION GLASS SLIDES DATING BACK OVER A CENTURY, THE JPC HAS EMBARKED ON AN INCREDIBLY EXCITING DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION TO DIGITIZE ITS VAST SLIDE ARCHIVE TO PROMOTE NOVEL RESEARCH.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00054	AND TO STREAMLINE ITS PATHOLOGY PRACTICE FOR CONSULTATION.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00056	AT PROSHA WE'RE HONORED TO DELIVER OUR CONCENTRIC PLATFORM TO THE JPC TO SUPPORT THEIR EFFORT AND AWS GOVCLAD WAS ALSO SELECTED TO SUPPORT THIS PROJECT DUE TO ITS STRONG COMPLIANCE MEASURES SCALABILITY AND EASE OF DEPLOYMENT
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00058	AS AN ASIDE THE JOINT PATHOLOGY CENTER'S GROUNDBREAKING PROJECT WAS RECENTLY FEATURED ON 60 MINUTES THE SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTED THE TREMENDOUS VALUE IN BEING ABLE TO SEARCH A VAST AND DIVERSE ARCHIVE OF DISEASE TO COMBAT PANDEMICS AND OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH CRISES
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00060	I'D ENCOURAGE ANYONE TO LOOK UP THE SEGMENT IF INTERESTED AS I'VE MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY IT INFRASTRUCTURE IS A CRUCIAL PIECE TO THE DIGITIZATION OF PATHOLOGY AWS CLOUD PROVIDES CUSTOMERS AN EFFICIENT SOLUTION RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00061	FIRST OFFERING SECURITY FOR SENSITIVE HEALTH CARE AND BIOPHARMA INFORMATION REGULATORY COMPLIANCE SCALE ABLE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR FAST GROWING AND HIGH VOLUME DATA SETS
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00062	ENABLING COLLABORATION FOR MORE EFFICIENT REMOTE WORK WHICH HAS OF COURSE BECOME INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT OVER THE PAST YEAR AND FINALLY COST EFFECTIVENESS MAKING ADOPTION EASIER INITIALLY AND ENABLING FUTURE EXPANSION
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00064	IN SUMMARY BEST IN CLASS SOFTWARE COUPLED WITH FLEXIBLE SCALEABLE AND SECURE IT INFRASTRUCTURE ARE REQUIRED TO BUILD THE FUTURE OF PATHOLOGY PROSHA AND AWS ARE PROUD TO PARTNER TO DELIVER SOLUTIONS THAT HELP OUR CUSTOMERS REALIZE THIS VISION
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00066	THANK YOU FOR LISTENING

YTB+npZWztwSMAk+00079	LOVE ALL, SERVE ALL. THANK YOU.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00001	ascertain that the patient is the right candidate for the procedure. Then the next step is the radiological planning which will be discussed in this video. One should know exactly how much is the varus or valgus deformity, whether the deformity is in the tibia or femur or both.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00002	HOW MUCH CORRECTION SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN ARE YOU GOING TO CORRECT IN THE TIBIA OR FEMUR OR IN BOTH THE STEPS IN RADIOLOGICAL PLANNING FOR HIGH TIBIAL OSTEOTOMY ARE OBTAINING PROPER X-RAYS AND ANALYZING THEM RADIOLOGICAL PLANNING
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00003	INTRA OPERATIVE VERIFICATION AND FINALLY OBTAINING A GOOD RESULT A STANDING FULL LENGTH X RAY WITH THE PATIENT BEARING WEIGHT ON BOTH THE LIMBS IS VERY CRUCIAL FOR PLANNING FOR OSTEOTOMY
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00004	THE X RAY SOURCE IS POSITIONED 10 FEET AWAY FROM THE PATIENT AND A LONG CASET CAN BE USED OR A CASET DECK AS SHOWN IN THE IMAGE WITH AN IMAGE PROCESSING SOFTWARE CAN ALSO BE USED
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00005	THE X RAY BEAM IS CENTERED ON THE KNEE AND THE EXPOSURE WOULD BE AROUND 85 TO 105 KILOVOLTS THE X RAY IMAGE WILL ALWAYS BE DOWNSIZED AND TO KNOW THE ORIGINAL MEASUREMENT'S PLACEMENT OF A OBJECT WITH A KNOWN SIZE IS IMPORTANT
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00006	A METALLIC SPHERE IS PREFERABLE AS IT CAST A ROUND SHADOW ALWAYS HERE A METALLIC BALL OF THREE CENTIMETERS WHICH IS EMBEDDED IN A CLOTH VELCRO BELT IS TIED AROUND THE LOWER THIRD OF THIGH IN LEVEL WITH THE BONE IN THE SAGITTAL SECTION
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00007	THE PATIENT'S PATElla SHOULD BE FACING FORWARD IN THE ANTERIOR SUPERIOR ILIAC SPINE SHOULD BE AT THE SAME LEVEL ANY LIMB LENGTH DISCREPANCY NOTED SHOULD BE ADDRESSED BY KEEPING PLANKS UNDER THE SHORTER LEG
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00008	A PROPERLY EXPOSED SCANOGRAM SHOULD BE EXAMINED FOR THE CENTRAL POSITION OF PATELLA THE LATERAL TIBIAL MARGIN SHOULD CROSS THE FIBULA AT THE WIDEST PART OF FIBULA THERE SHOULD BE A ONE THIRD OVERLAP OF FIBULA BY TIBIA
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00009	THE DISTAL FEMUR AND JOINT LINE SHOULD BE CLEARLY VISIBLE WITHOUT ANY OVERLAP IN PLANNING WE ARE CONCERNED PRIMARILY WITH MECHANICAL AXES ANATOMICAL AXIS OF A LONG BONE IS A LINE THAT DIVIDES THE SHAFT INTO TWO HALVES
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00010	THE MECHANICAL AXES OF THE FEMUR CONNECTS THE CENTER OF THE FEMURAL HEAD AND THE CENTER OF THE INTERCANDELAR NOTCH IN THE TIBIA IT IS A LINE CONNECTING THE CENTER OF THE TIBIAL ARTICULAR SURFACE WITH THE CENTER OF THE ANKLE JOINT
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00011	IN FEMUR THE ANATOMICAL AND MECHANICAL AXIS ARE DIFFERENT WITH A 6 TO 7 DEGREES VARIATION IN TIBIA BOTH ARE ALMOST SAME WITH THE ANATOMICAL AXIS BEING 3 TO 4 MILLIMETERS MEDIAL TO THE MECHANICAL AXIS
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00012	THE MECHANICAL AXIS OF THE ENTIRE LOWER LIMB, ALSO CALLED THE MECULEX LINE RUNS FROM THE CENTER OF THE FEMURAL HEAD TO THE CENTER OF THE ANKLE JOINT. UNDER PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS THIS LINE RUNS ON AN AVERAGE OF FOUR MILLIMETERS MEDIAL TO THE CENTER OF THE KNEE JOINT.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00013	WHEN THIS LINE IS DISPLACED MORE THAN 10 MILLIMETERS LATERALLY OR MORE THAN 15 MILLIMETERS MEDIALLY THEN IT IS CALLED A SIGNIFICANT MECHANICAL AXIS DEVIATION
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00014	IN THIS VIDEO WE WILL CONSIDER THE VARUS DEFORMITY PRIMARILY VARUS DEFORMITY COULD BE PRODUCED BY DEFORMITIES IN TIBIA OR FEMUR EROSION OF MEDIAL JOINT LAXITY OF LATERAL LIGAMENT STRUCTURES AND FOLLOWING MALUNITED AND TRARTICULAR FRACTURES
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00015	THE MECHANICAL AXIS DEVIATION WOULD INDICATE A SIGNIFICANT VARUS BUT TO UNDERSTAND THE ORIGIN OF THE VARUS
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00016	IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW AND CALCULATE THESE TWO MEASUREMENTS MEDIAL PROXIMAL TIBIAL ANGLE SHORTENED AS MPTA AND LATERAL DISTAL FEMORAL ANGLE SHORTENED AS LDFA
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00017	THE M P T A IS THE ANGLE FORMED BY THE MECHANICAL AXIS OF THE TIBIA WITH THE TANGENTIAL LINE TO THE TIBIAL ARTICULAR SURFACE ITS NORMAL VALUE IS 87 DEGREES WITH A DEVIATION OF 3 DEGREES
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00018	ANY DECREASE IN THE VALUE INDICATES THAT THE ORIGIN OF VARUS IS FROM THE TIBIA THE LDFA
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00019	IS THE ANGLE FORMED BY THE MECHANICAL AXIS OF THE FEMUR WITH THE TANGENTIAL LINE TO THE DISTAL FEMURAL ARTICULAR SURFACE AND ONCE AGAIN IT HAS THE SAME VALUE OF 87 DEGREES. ANY INCREASE IN THIS VALUE INDICATES THAT THE ORIGIN OF VARUSES FROM THE FEMUR.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00020	ONCE THE TIBIA IS CONFIRMED AS THE SOURCE OF VARUS THE CAUSE OF THE VARUS SHOULD BE ASCERTAINED IT COULD BE A MEDIAL JOINT EROSION IT COULD BE A METAPHYSIAL DEFORMITY
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00021	LOOSE LATERAL STRUCTURES DUE TO A PREVIOUS LIGAMENT INJURY OR STRETCHING CAN CAUSE LATERAL JOINT OPENING AGGRAVATING THE VARUS VERY RARELY THE VARUS CAN BE CONTRIBUTED BY A DIAPHYSEAL DEFORMITY
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00022	IN MANY CASES THE METAPHYSEAL VARUS CAN BE MEASURED BY CALCULATING THE TIBIAL BONE VARUS ANGLE
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00023	IT IS THE ANGLE FORMED BETWEEN THE EPIPHYSEAL AXIS, THE LINE THAT IS PERPENDICULAR TO THE LINE THAT CONNECTS THE MEDIAL AND LATERAL ENDS OF THE EPIPHYSEAL SCAR LINE AND THE MECHANICAL AXIS OF TIBIA. A TBVA MORE THAN 5 DEGREES INDICATES A METAPHYSEAL VARUS.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00024	H T O GIVES THE BEST RESULTS IF DONE FOR A METAPHYSEAL DEFORMITY AS IT CORRECTS THE DEFORMITY AND RESTORES NORMAL MORPHOLOGY IT GIVES THE BEST OUTCOMES
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00025	ON THE OTHER HAND AN H T O IN A NORMAL PROXIMAL TIBIAL MORPHOLOGY CAN INDUCE A NEW DEFORMITY EVEN THOUGH ONLOADING IS ACHIEVED IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE VARUS PRODUCED BY LATERAL JOINT OPENING DUE TO EXCESS LAXITY OF THE LATERAL LIGAMENT STRUCTURES
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00026	ONE SHOULD NOT CORRECT THIS COMPONENT OF VARUS IN BONE THE JOINT LINE CONVERGENCE ANGLE IS THE ANGLE BETWEEN THE TANGENTIALS TO THE DISTAL FEMORAL AND DISTAL TIBIAL ARTICULAR SURFACES UP TO 2 DEGREES IS NORMAL
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00027	ANY VALUE MORE THAN THAT SHOULD BE SUBTRACTED FROM THE OVERALL VARUS CORRECTION FUJISAWA POINT IS A POPULAR LANDMARK FOR SHIFTING THE WEIGHT-BEARING LINE WHICH WAS INFERRED FROM A RETROSPECTIVE SERIES
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00028	IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO SHIFT THE WEIGHT BEARING LINE TO FUJISAWA POINT IN ALL CASES
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00029	MOSTLY WE AIM TO ACHIEVE A 2 OR 3 DEGREE OF VALGUS TO ACHIEVE THAT THE WEIGHT BEARING LINE IS SHIFTED JUST LATERAL TO THE LATERAL TIBIAL SPINE
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00031	BUT DEPENDING ON THE PREVAILING OSTEOARTHRITIC CHANGES, THE WEIGHT BEARING LINE CAN BE SHIFTED FURTHER LATERALLY TO UNLOAD THE MEDIAL COMPARTMENT MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00032	WE KNOW THE DEFORMITY ANGLES AND DEGREES BUT WE NEED TO KNOW THE SIZE OF OPENING WEDGE IN MILLIMETERS TO COMPLETE THE OSTEOTOMY WE HAVE FEW METHODS WHICH WILL HELP US DERIVE THE EXACT HEIGHT OF THE OSTEOTOMY WEDGE IN MILLIMETERS
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00033	THE MINIACI METHOD IS THE ONE WHICH IS POPULARLY USED IN A WEIGHT-BEARING X-RAY THE EXISTING WEIGHT-BEARING LINE IS DRAWN THE CORRECTION POINT IS CHOSEN ACCORDING TO THE EXISTING OSTEOARTHRITIC CHANGES
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00034	AND THE HINGE POINT IS ALSO MARKED ON THE LATERAL TIBIAL CORTEX THE NEW WEIGHT BEARING LINE IS DRAWN THROUGH THE CORRECTION POINT THE NEW WEIGHT BEARING LINE SHOULD BE OF THE SAME LENGTH AS THE OLD WEIGHT BEARING LINE
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00035	THE DISTAL END OF THE NEW LINE IS CONNECTED TO THE HINGE POINT AND THEN ON TO THE CENTER OF THE ANKLE JOINT THE ANGLE MADE AT THE HINGE POINT IS NOTED AT THIS STAGE IF THERE IS A SOFT TISSUE VARUS, ANY JLCA MORE THAN 2 DEGREES SHOULD BE SUBTRACTED FROM THIS ANGLE MEASUREMENT
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00036	A TRIANGLE WITH THE HINGE POINT IS THE APEX WITH THE RESULT AN ANGLE IS DRAWN THE BASE OF THE TRIANGLE GIVES THE MEASUREMENT FOR THE OPENING WEDGE SINCE THE X-RAYS ARE DOWNSIZED IT IS IMPORTANT TO CALIBRATE AT THIS STAGE
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00037	NOW THE METALLIC SPHERE IS MEASURED AND THE CALIBRATION RATIO IS FOUND OUT AND IS APPLIED TO THE MEASUREMENT WHICH GIVES THE REAL LIFE OPENING DISTANCE IN MILLIMETERS ONE CAN ALSO USE VARIOUS SOFTWARES FOR RADIOLOGICAL PLANNING
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00038	BUT ONE SHOULD BE AWARE OF PLOTTING MISTAKES INTRAOBSERVER AND INTEROBSERVER VARIATIONS
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00039	ANOTHER PITFALL ONE SHOULD BE AWARE IS THE INTRA ARTICULAR DEFORMITY OF TIBIA, AS FOLLOWING A MALL UNITED MEDIAL TIBIAL FRACTURE OR A BLUNT'S DISEASE RESULTING IN A PAGODA TIBIA. HERE THE JOINT SURFACES ARE INCONGRUENT AND THE PATIENT WALKS WITH SEVERE VARUS THRUST.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00040	HERE AN INTRAARTICULAR OSTEOTOMY TO LIFT ONLY THE MEDIAL TIBIAL CONDILE IS APPROPRIATE DOING HTO IN THIS SITUATION CAN RESULT IN A TETER EFFECT WITH A POOR RESULT
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00042	ANOTHER PITFALL WOULD BE TO MISS THE VARUS DEFORMITY DUE TO SOFT TISSUE LAXITY THIS WOULD TYPICALLY RESULT IN AN OVERCORRECTION AS THE SOFT TISSUE LAXITY COLLAPSES ONCE THE KNEE GOES FOR VALGUS
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00043	IN MAJOR CORRECTIONS OVER 12 MILLIMETERS THE RESULTANT MPTA ANGLES SHOULD BE CALCULATED AN MPTA OF 94 DEGREES WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE IN A CORRECTION
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00044	ANYTHING MORE WOULD RESULT IN JOINT SHEER AND CAN RESULT IN POOR LONG-TERM OUTCOMES DISTRIBUTING THE CORRECTION ACROSS BOTH FEMUR AND TIBIA IN A DOUBLE LEVEL OSTEOTOMY WOULD PREVENT JOINT OBLIQUITY
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00045	THE TIBIA NORMALLY SLOPES DOWN PUSTERIALLY BY 7 TO 9 DEGREES IDEALLY ONE SHOULD NOT CHANGE THE TIBIAL SLOPE DURING AN HTO
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00046	HOWEVER ONE MUST REMEMBER THAT THE OPENING WEDGE OSTEOTOMY HAS A TENDENCY TO INCREASE THE SLOPE AND A CLOSING WEDGE OSTEOTOMY HAS A TENDENCY TO DECREASE THE SLOPE
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00047	IN A ACL DEFICIENT'S KNEE, THE SLOPE SHOULD NOT BE INCREASED AND IN A PCL DEFICIENT KNEE THE SLOPE SHOULD NOT BE DECREASED NOT ONLY PATIENT SELECTION, BUT CAREFUL RADIOLOGICAL PLANNING IS CRUCIAL FOR THE SUCCESS OF HIGH TIBIAL OSTEOTOMY
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00048	ONE SHOULD ALWAYS RESIST A TENDENCY TO EYEBALL OR DEPEND ON INTRAOPERATIVE CHECKS LIKE DIATHERMY CABLE OR LONG RODS PARALLAX AND POSITIONING ERRORS CAN LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT MISTAKES ALWAYS RELY ON YOUR PREOPERATIVE PLANNING VALUES
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00049	HTO IS A PROCEDURE OF PERFECTIONS IT STARTS FROM TAKING PERFECT X-RAYS TO CAREFUL EXECUTION THANKS FOR YOUR ATTENTION
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00001	Hello, all. My name is Kevin Dean. I'm a rheumatologist here at the Division of Rheumatology.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00002	MY TALK TODAY IS GOING TO BE AN UPDATE OF A TALK I GAVE BACK IN 2016 I'VE CHANGED THE TITLE TO NOW BE UPDATES IN THE PREVENTION OF RHEUMATOID
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00004	I HAVE SOME DISCLOSURES AROUND GRANT FUNDING AND CONSULTING FROM INDUSTRY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00006	AND THEN I THINK THESE SLIDES ARE AVAILABLE FOR EVERYBODY BUT HERE'S A COUPLE OF EVIDENCE-BASED REVIEWS THAT TALK IN MUCH MORE DETAIL ABOUT WHAT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT TODAY.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00008	SO THE DISEASE THAT I'M FOCUSING ON HERE IS RUMATORY ARTHRITIS IT'S AN IMMUNE DISEASE THAT PRIMARILY AFFECTS THE JOINTS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00010	CERTAINLY CAN AFFECT OTHER THINGS INCLUDING THE LUNGS AND IT'S ONE OF THE MOST DISABLED FORMS OF ARTHRITIS IT'S ALSO HIGHLY PREVALENT IN THE POPULATION AS FAR AS AUTOMANE DISEASE GOES
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00011	ABOUT 1% OF THE POPULATION AND I UPDATED THIS SLIDE FROM 2016 I JUST HAD TO LAUGH A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE NUMBER OF NAME CHANGES OUR BRONCO STADIUM HAS GONE THROUGH
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00012	HOPEFULLY I GOT THIS RIGHT IS NOW IN POWER FIELD BUT ONE PERCENT OF POPULATION SO IF YOU WERE AT A FOOTBALL GAME THAT WOULD BE A LITTLE OVER A SECTION FULL OF PEOPLE WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS SO PRETTY PRETTY DRAMATIC A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WITH THIS AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00014	SO IT'S ASSOCIATED WITH A LOT OF THINGS FOR AN INDIVIDUAL WITH DISEASE PAIN FATIGUE LOSS OF FUNCTION THERE'S ALSO EXTRA ARTICULAR MANIFESTATIONS HEART DISEASE IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00015	KILLERS PREMATURELY IN RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS SO FOLKS WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS GET HEART DISEASE ABOUT 10 YEARS EARLIER THAN THEY WOULD IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00016	AND THEY WOULD HAVE A VERY IMPACTFUL DISEASE.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00018	THE CURRENT PARADIGM OF HOW WE IDENTIFY AND TREAT RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS IS TO TREAT THE DISEASE ONCE IT'S CLINICALLY APPARENT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00019	WHICH IS ONCE SOMEBODY HAS STARTED TO HAVE JOINT SYMPTOMS, PAIN, STIFFNESS OR SWELLING, MADE IT THROUGH THEIR PRIMARY CARE, GOTTEN AN EVALUATION,
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00021	FIGURED OUT THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE SOME KIND OF INSULAMENTARY ARTHRITIS FINALLY REFERRED TO RHEUMATOLOGY AND FINALLY MADE A DIAGNOSIS WHICH THAT PROCESS HAS BEEN LOOKED AT IN THE UNITED STATES TAKES ON AVERAGE TWO YEARS FROM THE ONSET OF SYMPTOMS TO THE FINAL DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT FOR RHEUMATIC ARTHRITIS.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00023	AND THAT'S TOO LONG. THE DISEASE ACTUALLY DAMAGES WITHIN THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF DISEASE. SO AN OVERALL PREMISE THAT I'M GOING TO BUILD ON HERE IS WHAT IF WE COULD FIND RA
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00024	AND STOP IT BEFORE PEOPLE ACTUALLY STARTED HAVING JOINT DAMAGE I'LL TALK A BIT A BIT ABOUT THE RATIONALE FOR THAT STATEMENT AND THAT IDEA AND THEN TALK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING TO TRY AND DO THAT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00026	SO WE NOW KNOW THAT Rheumatoid Arthritis HAS A STAGED OR PHASED SET OF THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN TERMS OF DEVELOPMENT HERE'S A PICTURE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00027	THAT IS A PICTURE THAT IS A PICTURE THAT IS A PICTURE THAT IS A PICTURE THAT IS A PICTURE THAT IS A PICTURE THAT IS A PICTURE THAT IS A PICTURE THAT IS A PICTURE THAT IS A PICTURE THAT IS A PICTURE THAT IS A PICTURE THAT IS A PICTURE THAT IS A PICTURE THAT IS A PICTURE THAT IS A PICTURE THAT IS A PICTURE THAT IS A PICTURE THAT IS A PICTURE THAT IS A PICTURE THAT IS A PICTURE THAT IS A PICTURE THAT IS A PICTURE THAT IS A PICTURE THAT IS A PICTURE THAT IS A PICTURE THAT IS A PICTURE THAT IS A PICTURE THAT IS A PICTURE THAT IS A PICTURE THAT IS A PICTURE THAT IS A PICTURE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00028	THAT HAPPENS LONG BEFORE THIS AND ON AVERAGE 3 TO 5 YEARS BUT IT CAN BE UP TO 15 TO 17 YEARS IN SOME STUDIES WHERE GENES
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00029	AND ON AVERAGE THREE TO FIFTEEN TO SEVENTEEN YEARS IN SOME STUDIES WHERE GENES AND ON AVERAGE THREE TO FIFTEEN TO SEVENTEEN YEARS IN SOME STUDIES WHERE GENES AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES COMBINE TO SEVENTEEN YEARS IN SOME STUDIES WHERE GENES AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES COMBINE TO SEVENTEEN YEARS IN SOME STUDIES WHERE GENES AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES COMBINE TO FIRST TRIGGER A PERIOD OF AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES COMBINE TO FIRST TRIGGER A PERIOD OF AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES COMBINE TO FIRST TRIGGER A PERIOD OF ASYMPTOMATIC AUTOIMM
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00030	AND INFLAMMATION THAT'S DETECTABLE WITH BLOOD TESTS OR OTHER TESTS.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00032	AS WELL.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00033	AND ULTIMATELY CLASSIFY THEM AS HAVING A RANCHED DARK TREATMENT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00035	SO I'M GOING TO FOCUS THE REST OF THE TALK ON THIS PRECLINICAL ALSO CALLED PRE-RA PERIOD AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THAT PERIOD AND HOW WE'RE PLANNING TO INTERVENE TO TRY AND PREVENT THE ONSET OF THIS CLINICALLY APPARENT DISEASE.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00037	AND HOW WE'LL MEASURE IT'S GOING TO DEVELOP IN AN INDIVIDUAL. THERE'S AUTOANTIBIOTICS. I THINK PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH THESE.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00038	THERE'S TWO BIG SYSTEMS THAT WE THINK ABOUT IN TERMS OF RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS THERE'S RHEUMATOID FACTOR IT'S BEEN IDENTIFIED FOR DECADES
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00039	RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS THERE'S RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS THERE'S A NEWER SYSTEM THAT WE MAY BE LESS FAMILIAR WITH IS CALLED ACPA OR ANTIBODIES TO CITRULINATED PROTEIN OR PEPTIDE ANTIGENS DEPENDING WHO YOU TALK TO BUT ACPA
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00040	IS A CERTAIN TERM. THE CLINICAL TERM THAT WE USE FOR THE CLINICAL ASSAY THAT'S AVAILABLE IN ALL THE LABS IS CALLED A CCP. SO ACPA IS SORT OF AN UMBRELLA TERM. CCP IS THE SPECIFIC CLINICAL TERM. WHAT THIS MEASURES IS ANTIBODIES
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00041	IS ANTIBODIES THAT ARE USED TO POST TRANSLATION MODIFIED ARGININES INTO CITRALLINE SO WE ALL MAKE CITRALLINE IN OUR BODY ALL THE TIME IT COMES ALONG WITH INFLAMMATION IT COMES ALONG WITH NORMAL PROGRESSION ONE OF THE THINGS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00042	THE THE REASONS WE OFTEN DON'T HAVE WEBBED FINGERS IS BECAUSE UM CITRULLINATION OCCURS WITHIN CELLS AND IT CAUSES THOSE CELLS TO BE ORDERLY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00043	APOPTOS AND RE-ABSORBED SO SO IT'S PART OF OUR NORMAL PHYSIOLOGY WHAT'S UNUSUAL IS AUTOIMMUNITY TO CITRULLINATED PROTEINS THAT'S HIGHLY SPECIFIC FOR Rheumatoid Arthritis
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00045	JUST TO GET INTO THE WEEDS A LITTLE BIT BUT IT DOES HELP ME EXPLAIN SOME THINGS A LITTLE BIT LATER THE COMMERCIAL ASSAYS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00046	FOR ANTIBOTY STOCHYPTRAIN AND PROTEIN ARE CALLED CCP THEY ACTUALLY MEASURE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00047	ANTIBIOTICS TO A WHOLE VARIETY OF CITRULLINATED PROTEINS CITRULLINATED VIMENTIN VIBRINOGEN OTHER THINGS BUT IT JUST GIVES YOU A ONE READOUT SO JUST A LEVEL
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00048	WE CAN ACTUALLY BREAK THAT APART IN INTO RESEARCH ASSAYS WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY LOOK AT ANTIBODIES TO SPECIFIC CITRULLINATED PROTEINS AND ACTUALLY COUNT THEM UP AND SAY OH AN INDIVIDUAL HAS REACTIVITY TO EIGHT CITRULLINATED PROTEINS OR TEN
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00049	THAT'S GOING TO HELP UNDERSTAND HOW WE'VE UNDERSTOOD RHEUMATOID THERAPIST BUT THE COMMERCIAL ASSAY DOESN'T TELL YOU THAT JUST GIVES YOU KIND OF ONE READOUT THAT'S A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ANTIBODIES
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00050	THAT'S A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ANTIBODIES THAT'S A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ANTIBODIES THAT'S A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ANTIBODIES THAT'S A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ANTIBODIES THAT'S A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ANTIBODIES THAT'S A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ANTIBODIES THAT'S A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ANTIBODIES THAT'S A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ANTIBODIES THAT'S A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ANTIBODIES THAT'S A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ANTIBODIES THAT'S A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ANTIBODIES THAT'S A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ANTIBODIES THAT'S A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ANTIBODIES THAT'S A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ANTIBODIES THAT'S A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ANTIBODI
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00051	ARE IMAGES FROM A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BLOOD COLLECTED ON AVERAGE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00052	TEN YEARS BEFORE THEY GET RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND AFTER THEY GET DIAGNOSIS. ON THE LEFT-HAND SIDE ARE PEOPLE WHO DEVELOP RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. ON THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE ARE SERIAL MATCH CONTROLS. WE GOT THESE FOLKS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00053	THE DEPARTMENT OF THE DEFENSE SERUM REPOSITORY WHICH IS A THE DEFENSE SERUM REPOSITORY WHICH IS A GREAT RESOURCE IF ANYONE WANTS TO GREAT RESOURCE IF ANYONE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT HOW YOU CAN LOOK AT TALK ABOUT HOW YOU CAN LOOK AT NATURAL HISTORY OF DISEASE I CAN I CAN NATURAL HISTORY OF DISEASE I CAN I CAN INFORM YOU ABOUT THAT OFFLINE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00054	BASICALLY IF AN INDIVIDUAL'S IN THE MILITARY DEVELOPS RUMATORY ARTHRITIS YOU CAN GO FIND THEM AND THEN GO BACK IN TIME AND FIND BLOOD THAT'S BEEN COLLECTED THROUGH THIS DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE SERUM COLLECTION SYSTEM AND LOOK AT BLOOD BEFORE THEY GET DISEASED SO THAT'S A BACKGROUND TO THIS SLIDE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00055	INDIVIDUALS ON THE LEFT HAND PANEL WILL FOCUS THEIR DEVELOPED RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AT THIS TIME POINT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00057	AND THESE ARE INTERVALS BEFORE THEY DEVELOP RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. THIS IS BACK TO THAT POINT I MADE EARLIER. YOU CAN MEASURE INDIVIDUAL ANTIBODIES TO A VARIETY OF CITRULIN ANTIGENS. IF YOU JUST SQUINT AT THIS SLIDE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00058	YOU CAN SEE THAT THE RED COLOR INCREASES OVER TIME THAT MEANS INDIVIDUALS ARE DEVELOPING MORE AND MORE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00059	AUTOANTIBODIES TO A VARIETY OF CITRONATED PROTEINS. THEY START OFF WITH VERY FEW, THEY GET MORE AND MORE AND MORE AND PROGRESS TO THE POINT WHERE THEY GET ALREADY HAVE A LOT OF AUTOANTIBODIES AND THEN THIS IS THAT THRESHOLD THEY CROSS AND DEVELOP CLINICALLY APPARENT DISEASE.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00061	FOLLOWING THAT ALSO THERE'S AN ELEVATION OF INFLAMMATION THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO READ THIS BUT THERE'S A WHOLE LIST OF CYTOKINES DOWN BELOW IF YOU CAN KIND OF SQUINT THE RED
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00062	COLORS INCREASE OVER TIME TO THE POINT AT WHICH A RHEUMATOID ARTHREST CLINICALLY DEVELOPS AND YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A BASICALLY STORM OF INFLAMMATION THROUGH A VARIETY OF CYTOKINES
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00064	AND THIS IS REALLY UNIQUE AND SPECIFIC FOR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00066	THERE'S OF COURSE OTHER IMMUNE SYSTEMS THAT ARE GOING ABNORMAL IN THIS PERIOD THERE'S RHEUMATOID FACTORS ALSO DEVELOPING ALONG WITH THESE ANTIBIOTICS AND PROTEINS THERE'S A WHOLE HOST OF NEW ANTIBODY SYSTEMS THAT WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT AS WE GO I WON'T GO INTO THAT IN GREAT DETAIL
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00067	THERE'S GROWING NUMBER OF CELLULAR STUDIES IN THIS PERIOD AS WELL AND KIND OF AT A LAY PERSON LEVEL WE ONE CAN THINK OF THIS AS A LITTLE BIT OF INFLAMMATION AT A CANDLE LEVEL
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00068	PROBABLY FIVE TO TEN YEARS BEFORE YOU GET Rheumatoid Arthritis A CAMPFIRE LEVEL A COUPLE YEARS BEFORE AND FINALLY FULL BLOWN FIRE WHICH IS THE CLINICAL DISEASE OF Rheumatoid Arthritis
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00070	SO YOU CAN START TRIMMING THIS DOWN AND LOOKING AT THIS IN A LITTLE BIT CLEARER WAY AND IF YOU JUST COUNT THE NUMBER OF ACPA'S WE'RE REFERRING BACK A COUPLE SLIDES BACK WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL CAN HAVE ANTIBODIES TO ONE CITRULIN PROTEIN OR ANOTHER IF YOU JUST COUNT THOSE UP
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00072	WHAT HAPPENS IS PEOPLE START OFF WITH A LOW NUMBER OF ANTIBODIES TO CITRULLINATED PROTEINS THAT INCREASES OVER TIME TO THE POINT AT WHICH THEY GET ROOMMATURE ARTHRITIS IF YOU COUNT THE NUMBER OF CYTOCANSER ELEVATED THAT INCREASES OVER TIME
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00074	AND IMPORTANTLY UNDERSTANDING THAT MODEL OF HOW RA HAS DEVELOPED HAS LED TO WAYS TO USE ANTIBODIES TO PREDICT WHO IS GOING TO GET RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS IN THE FUTURE.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00075	AND IT CAN BE BOILED DOWN EVEN MORE SIMPLY WITH A CCP ASSAY AND I WON'T GO INTO THE DETAILS HERE BUT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00076	ONE OF THE MORE COMMON ASSAYS IS A C C P THREE WHICH IS JUST A COMMERCIAL VERSION YOU CAN USE ONE SINGLE ASSAY THAT GIVES YOU A SINGLE READOUT LEVELS CAN GO
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00077	FROM VERY LOW OR WHAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED NORMAL INCREASE OVER TIME CROSS A THRESHOLD AT WHICH POINT THEY'RE CONSIDERED POSITIVE AND THEN INCREASE IN A PERSON FINALLY DEVELOPS FROM A TREATED THREATISM
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00078	THIS MAKES PREDICTION QUITE SIMPLE BECAUSE ONE CAN NOW USE ONE COMMERCIAL ASSAY AND SAY WHAT IS YOUR LEVEL AND THEN GET AN ESTIMATE OF YOUR OVERALL RISK FOR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AS WELL AS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00080	WHAT TIME PERIOD IN THE NEAR FUTURE YOU MAY DEVELOP RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. SO THIS FIGURE KIND OF TELLS YOU THAT. YOU CAN SEE LEVELS CAN GO UP IN THE LEVEL HERE.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00081	IS ON AVERAGE TWO TO FOUR YEARS BEFORE SOMEBODY GETS RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND THIS IS A LEVEL WHICH I WON'T SHOW YOU THIS PICTURE IS UNHEARD OF IN SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T GO ON TO GET RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS SO SPECIFIC FOR DISEASE AND HELPFUL IN TERMS OF TIMING OF PREDICTION OF FUTURE DISEASE.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00083	IN FACT YOU CAN BROIL THIS DOWN TO A SIMPLE MODEL WHERE A CCP3 OF GREATER THAN 40 UNITS GIVES AN OVERALL RISK OF 50% FOR DEVELOPING RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS WITHIN THE NEXT THREE YEARS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00085	SO WHAT IS HELPFUL HERE IS THESE ACPA TESTS IN PARTICULAR THAT COMMERCIAL ASSAY C C P
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00087	IS VERY SPECIFIC FOR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. INDEED, IF YOU HAVE SYNOBITIS, IT LOOKS LIKE RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND THIS TEST IS POSITIVE. IT'S REALLY OVER 90% SPECIFIC.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00088	IF YOU DON'T HAVE SYNOVITIS THERE'S PROBABLY A NINETY PERCENT POSITIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE IN SOME CASE CONTROL STUDIES
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00089	MAYBE AS LOW AS 30 PERCENT IN DOLLARS BUT REALLY A HIGH POSITIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE THAT YOU WILL DEVELOP IN THE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00091	BUT CERTAINLY AS I MENTIONED BEFORE LIKELIHOOD AND TIMING NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IN PREDICTION THAT'S WHERE THAT MODEL OF THE TEST BEING POSITIVE AND POSITIVE A CERTAIN LEVEL GETS YOU BOTH LIKELIHOOD AND TIMING OF RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS NOW IMPORTANTLY THIS IS UNDERPINNED
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00092	PREVENTION STUDIES IN RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS WHERE ONE CAN GO OUT FIND INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE ELEVATIONS OF THESE BIOMARKERS AND THEN INTERVENE TO TRY AND PREVENT OR DELAY THEM FROM GOING ON TO GET RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00093	AND THERE'S A BIT OF A LANDSCAPE OF RA PREVENTION THAT'S EVOLVED SINCE I GAVE THIS TALK IN 2016. THERE WAS ONE KNOWN STUDY WHICH IS CALLED THE DUTCH DEXAMETHASONE STUDY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00094	WHERE INDIVIDUALS THAT HAD EITHER HIGH LEVELS OF RHEUMATOID FACTOR OR ACPA AND HAD SOME MAKES AND PAINS BUT NO INFLAMMATORY ARTHRITIS WERE GIVEN TWO DOSES OF DEXAMETHESONE AT A PRETTY WAPPING DOSE IT DID NOT PROGRESS DID NOT HALT PROGRESSION TO INFLAMMATORY ARTHRITIS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00095	DECREASED THE AUTOANTIBIOS A LITTLE BIT BUT THIS WAS OVERALL CONSIDERED A NEGATIVE STUDY THAT WAS FOLLOWED UP BY A STUDY CALLED PRAIRIE WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN 2019
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00097	YEARS AGO WHERE PEOPLE WHO ARE POSITIVE FOR ACPA AND RHEUMATOID FACTOR RECEIVED ONE DOSE OF THE B-CELL DEPLETING AGENT RITUXAMAB. IT DID NOT DECREASE IN OVERALL PROGRESSION IN INFLAMMATORY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00098	NOT DECREASE IN OVERALL PROGRESSION IN INFLAMMATORY ARTHRITIS BUT IT DID SLOW THE ONSET OF DISEASE SO SLOW THE ONSET OF DISEASE SO THOUGHT TO BE A SUCCESSFUL TRIAL THOUGH IT WASN'T A COMPLETE PREVENTION. COUPLE OTHER STUDIES HAVE HAD READOUTS RECENTLY.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00099	STATEN WHERE PEOPLE WERE GIVEN A TORVOSTATIN TO TRY AND INTERVENE IN FOLKS THAT WERE ACPA POSITIVE TO TRY AND PREVENT FUTURE DISEASE THE AFTORVASTATIN DID NOT WORK AT ALL
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00101	THE RATIONALE BEHIND THAT WAS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT ATORVASTATIN ACTUALLY IN ADDITION TO CHOLESTEROL MODULATING FACTORS HAS SOME IMMUNE FACTORS THAT WAS A RATIONALE FOR THAT DOG BUT DID NOT WORK AND SO IT'S TAKING IT OUT OF THE RUNNING FOR TRYING TO PREVENT FUTURE RUINED TRETH RITES
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00102	AND THIS IS BREAKING NEWS ONLY IN ABSTRACT FORM IN THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS A STUDY IN GERMANY WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL THAT MIGHT HAVE ACPA POSITIVITY OR CCP ASSAY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00103	PLUS EVIDENCE OF INFLAMMATION IN THE JOINT ON MRI BUT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU COULD SEE ON PHYSICAL EXAM OR GIVEN A DRUG CALLED ABBOTASIP WHICH IS A T-CELL CO-STIMULATION BLOCKER
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00104	VERSUS A PLACEBO AND AN EARLY READ OUT HERE IS THAT IT'S ACTUALLY DECREASING THE PROGRESSION OF RHEUMATURAL ARTHRITIS VERY EXCITING FINDINGS BUT THAT NEEDS TO BE FLESHED OUT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00106	BUT WITH THAT AS BACKGROUND FEW YEARS BACK WE DEVELOPED OUR OWN PREVENTION STUDY THAT WE CALL STOP RA AND THE BIG NAME IS STRATEGY TO PREVENT THE ONSET OF CLINICALLY APPARENT RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS THIS WAS FUNDED BY THE NIH AND NIAID
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00107	AND WE'RE THE PRINCIPAL SITE HERE WE DEVELOPED THE STUDY BUT WE'RE OPERATING ON MULTIPLE SITES ACROSS THE COUNTRY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00108	AND I THINK MY COLLEAGUES CHRIS STRIBICK AND MY COLORS AND UM MARIE FAZER WHO'S BEEN OUR PRIMARY STUDY COORDINATOR HERE HAVE REALLY HELPED LAUNCH THIS STUDY UM I THINK ALL OF OUR RHEUMATOLOGISTS IN THE STATE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00109	A LOT OF RHEUMATOLOGISTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN A CAST OF THOUSANDS WHICH IS SORT OF A JOKE BUT I'LL TELL YOU IT'S NOT ACTUALLY A JOKE WHEN YOU SEE WHAT WE'VE HAD TO DO WITH THIS STUDY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00110	SO WHAT WE DID WITH THIS STUDY DEVELOP AN INCLUSION CRITERIA HARKENING BACK TO A COUPLE SLIDES BACK WHERE WE USED THIS ACPA TEST THE CCP 3 TEST IT WAS TWO TIMES NORMAL
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00111	RATED DEVELOPMENT OF RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS WITH A PROJECTED RATE OF DEVELOPMENT OF RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS OF 50% BY THREE YEARS. WE HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY LEARNED THAT THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT OF AN OVERESTIMATE BUT I THINK THAT STILL NEEDS TO BE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00112	STILL NEEDS TO BE EVALUATED FURTHER THAT HAS SOME IMPORTANCE WITH THE SLIDE I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF SLIDES THE INTERVENTION THAT WE SELECTED HERE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00113	WAS A RANDOMIZED BLINDED PLACEBO CONTROLLED STUDY USING THE DRUG HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE WHICH IS A BIT OF A MYSTERY ON HOW IT WORKS IT WAS ORIGINALLY USED FOR MALARIA TREATMENT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00114	PROBABLY BECAUSE IT ELEVATES THE PH INSIDE OF CELLS CAUSING IT TO BE AN UNHOSPITABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR FOR MALARIA
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00116	CELLS. THAT ALTERS IMMUNE FUNCTION OF CELLS AND DAMPENS IT A BIT, MAKES CELLS LESS AUTO REACTIVE, LESS INFLAMMATORY. WE THINK THAT'S THE MECHANISM WHY IT WORKS IN A VARIETY OF DISEASES INCLUDING LUPUS AND
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00117	THE INTERVENTION WAS GIVING THE DRUG FOR ONE YEAR STOPPING FOLLOWING TWO YEARS OF FOLLOW-UP AFTER THAT TO SEE IF THE DRUG WORKED WAS THERE A DURABLE RESPONSE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00118	IT WAS GOING TO BE SHOOT THE MOON HYPOTHESIS A TIME LIMITED DRUG INTERVENTION IN THIS PRECLINICAL RA PERIOD WOULD RESET IMMUNITY LEAD TO LASTING IMPROVEMENT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00119	IN THE END POINTS WERE DEVELOPMENT OF CLASSIFIABLE RUMATORY ARTHROISIS WHICH HARKEN BACK TO THOSE PICTURES I SHOWED YOU EARLIER BASICALLY A PATIENT WITH SWALLEN JOINTS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00120	SAFETY WAS ALSO A PRIMARY OUTCOME STUDY DESIGNED JUST REAL BRIEFLY AN INDIVIDUAL WOULD COME INTO THE STUDY GET ONE YEAR STUDY DRAG WITH A FEW VISITS AND THEN TWO YEARS OFF A STUDY DRAG AND TO FOLLOW UP
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00121	SO WE'VE ACTUALLY COMPLETED RANDOMIZATION OF THE STUDY AND WE'RE NOW IN THE FOLLOW-UP PHASE A COUPLE PEOPLE ARE STILL ON STUDY DRUG UM
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00122	WE'VE RANDOMIZED 140 SUBJECTS WHICH WE REVISED THAT WE WERE AIMING FOR 200 TO START WITH AND SOME INTERIM ANALYSES REALIZED WE COULD DO WITH A LITTLE LESS PEOPLE AND FIND FIND A SIGNIFICANT RESULT.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00123	AND THE STUDY'S ONGOING SO I YOU WON'T GET A PUNCH LINE HERE TODAY HOPEFULLY WE WILL HAVE THIS READ OUT VERY SOON AND I WILL BE ABLE TO
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00124	PROVIDE US AND THE WORLD FRANKLY WITH THE RESULTS FROM THE STUDY I WILL JUST SPEND A COUPLE OF MINUTES HERE IF YOU'RE GOING TO DEVELOP AN AGENT THAT YOU CAN
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00125	PUT INTO AN AT-RISK PERIOD OF DISEASE THERE'S A LOT OF CONSIDERATIONS THAT HAVE TO GO INTO THAT IS IT GOING TO WORK UM IS IT GOING TO BE SAFE IS IT GOING TO BE TOLERATED IS IT GOING TO BE COST EFFECTIVE ARE PEOPLE GOING TO BE WILLING TO TAKE IT SO WE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00126	IS IT GONNA BE SAFE IS IT GOING TO BE TOLERATED IS IT GOING TO BE TOLERATED AND IS IT GOING TO BE TOLERATED AND IT'S IS IT GOING TO BE TOLERATED AND IT'S GOING IS IT GOING TO BE TOLERATED AND IT'S GOING TO IS IT GOING TO IS IT GOING TO IS IT GOING TO IS IT GOING TO IS IT GOING TO IS IT GOING TO IS IT GOING TO IS IT GOING TO IS IT GOING TO IS IT GOING TO IS IT GOING TO IS IT GOING TO IS IT GOING TO IS IT GOING TO IS IT GOING TO IS IT GOING TO IS IT GOING TO IS IT GOING TO IS IT GOING TO IS IT GOING TO IS IT GOING TO IS IT GOING TO IS IT GOING TO IS IT GOING TO IS IT GOING TO IS IT GOING TO IS IT GOING TO IS IT GOING TO IS IT GOING TO IS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00127	AND WE ARRIVED AT THIS DRUG CALLED HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE OR PLAQUINA WHICH
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00128	NO ONE HAD EVER HEARD OF BEFORE COVID CAME ALONG AND THEN SUDDENLY EVEN THE PRESIDENT IS TALKING ABOUT THIS ON NEWS CONFERENCES. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE STILL AWARE OF IT.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00129	IS SOMETHING WE USE WIDELY IN RHEUMATURAL ARTHRITIS ALREADY IF YOU HAVE ESTABLISHED DISEASE IN LUPUS BUT THIS WAS OUR FINALLY CHOICE ANOTHER ASPECT THAT CAME INTO THIS WAS IT WAS A DRUG THAT ANYONE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00130	COULD PRESCRIBE IT'S PRETTY SAFE IT DOESN'T REALLY REQUIRE SPECIALIST MANAGEMENT OF THE AGENT SO IF
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00131	IT'S GOING TO WORK IT'S BE A GREAT DRUG SO THIS IS WHY WE'RE TRYING IT AS ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES CHRISTRY BECAUSE HEAD
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00132	THIS IS A DRUG THAT EITHER HAS TO SUCCEED OR FAIL BECAUSE IF WE DON'T LOOK AT THIS DRUG AS COMMONLY USED IN RA PEOPLE WOULD ALWAYS WONDER DOES IT WORK BECAUSE IT'S SO SAFE AND IF IT'S EFFECTIVE THAT WILL BE A GREAT OPTION SO THIS IS WHY WE LOOKED AT IT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00133	AND I WILL JUST SAY HERE'S THE JOKE SLIDE THIS IS A LAKE SIDE PARK HERE IN DENVER UM ASK ME SOMETIME OFFLINE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00134	ABOUT USING A DRUG HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE IN A STUDY BUT WHEN YOU STARTED IT NO ONE HAD EVER HEARD OF THE DRUG AND SUDDENLY EVERYBODY WANTS TO TAKE THE DRUG UM TO PREVENT COVID IT YOU KNOW FOR A FEW MONTHS THERE AND INDEED THE NIH CAME TO US
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00135	AND I HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A THOUGHT ABOUT IT WHEN IT WAS LOOKING EARLY DAYS LIKE THERE'S SOME QUESTION OF WHETHER COVID LOOKED LIKE IT WAS GOING TO WORK ABOUT STOPPING OUR STUDY AND
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00136	THAT.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00138	UM
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00140	So our enrollment goals for the study were actually higher. And as I said, we lowered that estimate. We completed enrollment randomization for 144 subjects back in November.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00142	IT WAS CERTAINLY A CHALLENGE SO IF YOU THINK A DISEASE LIKE PARKING BACK TO THAT PICTURE OF THE BRONCO STADIUM ONE PERCENT OF PEOPLE ARE AFFECTED BY RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS SO THAT MEANS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00143	MAYBE ONE PERCENT ARE PEOPLE ARE WALKING AROUND OUT THERE WHO ARE AT RISK FOR FUTURE RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS IT'S PROBABLY EVEN LOWER THAN THAT RIGHT BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY'S ACTUALLY GOING TO GET RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS SO THE CHALLENGES OF HOW DO YOU GO TO A
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00144	GROUP OF PEOPLE FIND WHO IS CCP POSITIVE IN GOING TO GET RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS IN THE FUTURE AND THEN THE NEXT PART OF THAT IS HOW TO GET THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STUDY AND THAT'S BEEN A HUGE CHALLENGE OF OF THE PROJECT FOR STOP RA
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00145	P POSITIVE AND GOING TO GET R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00146	ENROLLMENT FOR THE STUDY WE'VE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE NINE HEALTH FAIR THE ARTHRITIS FOUNDATION THE CAMPUS HERE A LOT OF PROVIDERS ON CAMPUS WHO FOUND THESE FOLKS IN THEIR CLINICS AND REFERRED THEM TO US A LOT OF RHEUMATOLOGISTS ACROSS THE STATE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00147	SO A VARIETY OF WAYS TESTING FIRST DEGREE RELATIVES OR FDRS OF PEOPLE WITH RHEUMATOLOGY GETS YOU A HIGHER RISK GROUP
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00148	FOR FUTURE RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS SOMETIMES PEOPLE SHOW UP IN RHEUMATOLOGY CLINICS OR PRIMARY CARE CLINICS WITH EYES AND PAINS AND THEY TEST POSITIVE FOR CCP BUT DON'T HAVE INFLAMMATION IN THEIR JOINTS YET
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00149	AND THEN WE CAN DO SOME POPULATION BASED APPROACHES I'VE ALREADY MENTIONED WE USED THE NINE HEALTH FAIRS HERE IN COLORADO EXTENSIVELY OTHER GROUPS THAT HAVE PARTICIPATED WITH US INCLUDING GROUPS IN OKLAHOMA ADDED ON A C C P TEST AND A SHORT CONSENT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00150	TO ABOUT 5,000 PEOPLE WHO DONATED BLOOD IN OKLAHOMA TESTED THEM ALL FOR C C P AND RECRUITED A LARGE NUMBER OF FOLKS OUT OF THAT GROUP TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR STUDY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00151	WE'VE LOOKED AT SOME OTHER STORE BIOBANKS AT AT SITES INCLUDING MAYO CLINIC AND BRINGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL AND FOUND C C P POSITIVE THAT WAY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00152	SO THE SCOPE OF THIS AND I'LL JUST KIND OF BOIL THIS DOWN IN INTEREST OF TIME IS WE'VE TESTED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS 30,000 INDIVIDUALS FOR C C P AT 17 SITES ACROSS THE COUNTRY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00153	IN A RATE OF ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE PERCENT POSITIVE OR ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY INDIVIDUALS FOR C C P POSITIVE AT A I LEFT THIS OUT AT A LEVEL OF C C P AT TWO TIMES THE NORMAL CUTOFFS A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN JUST AN AVERAGE POSITIVE TEST.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00154	A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN JUST AN AVERAGE POSITIVE TEST AND WE WERE ABLE TO OUT OF THAT FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY PEOPLE RANDOMIZED THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PEOPLE RANDOMIZED THE HUNDRED AND FOURTY FOUR OR ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT. FOURTY FOUR OR ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT. NOW A BUNCH OF THOSE FOLKS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00155	JOINED THE STUDY FORTUNATELY SOME WERE WILLING TO GET TESTED AND EVEN BEEN THEN PRESENTED WITH THE THE DRUG HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO TAKE A MEDICINE BECAUSE THEY FELT WELL SO DROPPED OUT FOR THAT WAY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00156	AND A PORTION OF THOSE FOLKS DROPPED OUT OF THE STUDY BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY WANTED TO HAVE UNDIAGNOSED RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND SO THAT'S SOME ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES WHEN YOU GET INTO THE PREVENTION GAME AND START SCREENING FOR PEOPLE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00157	AND SO THAT'S SOME ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES WHEN YOU GET INTO THE PREVENTION GAME AND START SCREENING FOR PEOPLE ONE, FINDING PEOPLE TO TEST. FOR PEOPLE TO TEST. THE TEST IS FORTUNATELY SPECIFIC
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00158	MOSTLY FINDING OTHER CONDITIONS THAT YOU GOT TO WORRY ABOUT THIS IS A CONSIDERATION ESPECIALLY WITH THE RA TEST RHEUMATOID FACTOR WHICH CAN BE ELEVATED IN
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00159	SEE CHRONIC INFECTIONS OR MALIGNANCY SO IF YOU FIND SOMEBODY WHO'S RHEUMATOID FACTOR POSITIVE IN ABSENCE OF CCP YOU GOTTA WORRY ABOUT ALL THESE OTHER CONDITIONS YOU MAY HAVE INADVERTENTLY DISCOVERED
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00160	BUT REALLY C C P AVOIDS MOST OF THAT BUT ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES WE'VE HAD IN THE STUDY IS PREVIOUSLY UNDIAGNOSED RHEUMATOID RHEUMATOID RHEUMATOID RHEUMATOID RHEUMATOID RHEUMATOID RHEUMATOID RHEUMATOID RHEUMATOID RHEUMATOID RHEUMATOID RHEUMATOID RHEUMATOID RHEUMATOID RHEUMATOID RHEUMATOID RHEUMATOID RHEUMATOID RHEUMATOID RHEUMATOID RHEUMATOID RHEUMATOID RHEUMATOID RHEUMATOID RHEUMATOID RHEUMATOID RHEUMATOID RHEUMATOID RHEUMATOID RHEUMATO
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00161	IN IDENTIFY A PATHWAY TO CARE FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS. THAT'S A LOT OF ETHICS AROUND THAT IF YOU FIND SOMEBODY IN YOUR SCREENING
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00163	THAT HAS THE DISEASE OF INTEREST AND THEY'RE NOT GOOD FOR YOUR PREVENTION HOW DO YOU HELP THEM GET TO THE RIGHT PLACE?
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00165	SO THIS IS THE CLIFF HANGER HERE THE INTERIM ANALYSIS OF THE STUDY IS PENDING BUT WE HAVE SOME EARLY DATA THAT 30 PERCENT OF SUBJECTS HAVE DEVELOPED RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AS PART OF THE STUDY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00166	THAT'S A BITTER SWEET FINDING I WOULD JUST SAY ANYBODY WHO'S CCP POSITIVE REALLY DOESN'T REALLY THINK THEY'RE GOING TO GET RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS OR CERTAINLY DOESN'T WANT TO GET IT BUT IT IS IMPORTANT IN THIS PREVENTION STATE ACTUALLY HAVE PEOPLE GET YOUR OUTCOME OF INTEREST TO SEE IF YOUR INTERVENTION CAN ACTUALLY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00167	LOWER AN INDIVIDUAL'S RISK FOR GOING FORWARD SO I WILL KEEP THE CAMPUS AND THE WORLD POSTED ON THIS AS WE LEARN MORE IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS HOPEFULLY BECAUSE WE'VE FULLY RANDOMIZED AND WE'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE AT LEAST A GOOD INTERIM READOUT VERY SOON
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00169	SO
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00171	In thinking about this trial, thinking about some of the trials that came before it or have been published since we started this, it's really mostly critical to learn everything we can about all aspects of prevention as we move ahead because
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00172	ADMITTEDLY WHEN WE STARTED THIS WE HAD SOME GRASP OF THE CONCEPTS THAT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH BUT AS WE MOVED THROUGH THIS THE WHOLE PROCESS THERE'S JUST HUGE CHALLENGES IN TRYING TO IDENTIFY AND SCREEN AND PREVENT A DISEASE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00173	IN THIS SLIDE IS VERY BUSY BUT IT HAS A LOT OF THE ELEMENTS THAT HAVE TO COME TOGETHER I'D SAY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS FINDING SUBJECTS OR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE AT RISK FOR DISEASE AND GETTING THEM TO PARTICIPATE THAT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT CERTAINLY FINDING
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00174	FUNDING FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES GETTING INDUSTRY TO PARTICIPATE YOU CAN ENVISION INDUSTRY IN THE RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AS A MODEL THAT'S BUILT ON ONCE YOU GET DISEASE IT'S A FOREVER DISEASE WE GOT TO KEEP GIVING YOU DRUGS FOREVER
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00175	DISEASE WE GOTTA KEEP GIVING YOU DRUGS FOREVER BUT IF A PREVENTION APPROACH ACTUALLY AVERAGATED THAT OR CHANGED THAT INDUSTRY MAY HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT LOOK AT A DISEASE AND SO YOU REALLY WANT TO HAVE THEM INTERESTED IN WANTING TO PUSH FOR PREVENTION.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00176	MEASURING LOTS OF OTHER THINGS INCLUDING OUTCOMES IS VERY IMPORTANT GETTING HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS ULTIMATELY IF WE FIND A DRUG THAT WORKS TO PREVENT ROOM TO AUTHORIZE HOW TO LAUNCH THAT INTO ACTUAL CLINICAL CARE A LOT OF THINGS TO THINK ABOUT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00177	I WILL SAY PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THINKING ABOUT SOME OF THE DRUGS THAT WE THOUGHT WERE GOING TO WORK REALLY WELL TO PREVENT RA THAT WAS PUBLISHED ALREADY RITUXAMAB
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00178	STEROIDS AND THEN WE'LL HAVE TO SEE IF THIS T-CELL COSTIMULATION WORKS BUT THINKING ABOUT THE BASIC SCIENCE OF THIS DISEASE DEVELOPMENT DO WE REALLY KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH OUR INTERVENTIONS ARE WE MAKING THE RIGHT CHOICES.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00180	AND REALLY THIS SLIDE KIND OF HIGHLIGHTS THE STATEMENT HERE UNDERSTANDING THE R.A. PATHOGENESIS IS RAPIDLY ADVANCING AND ACTUALLY FUNDAMENTALLY PROBABLY CHANGE OUR NEXT PREVENTION TRIALS.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00181	THE GOOD NEWS IS I THINK WE HAVE NOW SET IN THE FIELD THAT YOU CAN FIND PEOPLE WHO ARE AT RISK FOR FUTURE RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND WHO WILL GET RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00182	AND WHO WILL GET RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND WHO WILL GET RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. I THINK THE FIELD HAS ALSO I THINK THE FIELD HAS ALSO I THINK THE FIELD HAS ALSO THOUGHT IT'S PROBABLY WORTHWHILE THOUGHT IT'S PROBABLY WORTHWHILE THOUGHT IT'S PROBABLY WORTHWHILE TRYING TO INTERVENE TO PREVENT TRYING TO INTERVENE TO PREVENT TRYING TO INTERVENE TO PREVENT THIS DISEASE. THIS DISEASE. THIS DISEASE. THOSE ARE TWO HUGE HURDLES. THOSE ARE TWO HUGE HURDLES. THOSE ARE TWO HUGE HURDLES. NOW FINDING THE RIGHT APPROACH TO NOW FINDING THE RIGHT APPROACH TO NOW FINDING THE RIGHT APPRO
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00183	AND I'LL JUST A SHOUT OUT TO SOME MEMBERS OF MY DIVISION I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR SOME OTHER TALKS THROUGH THE SAME LECTURE SYSTEM GOING FORWARD ABOUT THESE THINGS INCLUDING A MUCOSAL HYPOTHESIS WHICH I WON'T GO INTO IN HUGE DETAIL TODAY BUT TO TOUCH ON THIS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00184	CHRISTIE KUN CHRISTINE DEMERAL BOTH IN THE DIVISION OF HYPOTOLOGY MEGAN CHRISWELL WHO'S A GRAD STUDENT HAS BEEN WORKING ON THIS EXTENSIVELY HAVE REALLY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00185	HELPED US UNDERSTAND THAT THE EARLY PHASES MAY NOT BE IN THE JOINTS AT ALL BUT OTHER SITES AND I THINK IT WILL BE GROUNDBREAKING FOR HOW WE APPROACH PREVENTION IN THE FUTURE.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00187	SO I HAVE A FIGURE TO KIND OF HIGHLIGHT THIS HERE. ULTIMATELY WHEN WE WANT TO THINK ABOUT RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS HOW IT DEVELOPS AND WHERE WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PREVENT WE WANT TO INTERVENE IN THE FUTURE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00188	WITH WITH APPROACHES THAT ARE ROOTED IN STAGE SPECIFIC BIOLOGY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00190	SO IF WE HAVE A PERSON WHO ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE HAS JOINT DISEASE AND INVOLVEMENT IN RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS WHERE WE HAVE LOTS OF EXPERIENCE IN DEVELOPING DRUGS AND INTERVENING WITH DRUGS, NOW WE'VE TAKEN THAT EXPERIENCE AND MOVED THAT, ALL THOSE DRUGS,
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00191	INTO AN EARLIER PHASE OF RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. HETEROXYCHLOROQUINE, EVEN THE TORVOSTAT AND ALL THE OTHER DRUGS I TALKED ABOUT ARE ALL WELL STUDIED IN THE ARTICULAR DISEASE OF RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. WE'RE MOVING THEM AND THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00192	AND THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND THAT MAK
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00193	TO BE ABLE TO PREVENTION OF R A UNLESS IT'S ALREADY BEEN TRIED IN THE EXISTING DISEASE SO THAT HELPS IT. SO THIS MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. SO THIS MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. BUT I THINK WHERE WE WANT TO THINK ABOUT GOING FORWARD IN RUMATORIAL ARTHRITIS AND RUMATORIAL ARTHRITIS PREVENTION IS UNDERSTANDING THIS PROPAGATION OR SYSTEMIC IMMUNE PHASE WITHOUT THE ARTHRITIS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00194	AND IDENTIFY WHAT ARE THE NOVEL TARGETS IN THIS PERIOD
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00195	PRECISELY IDENTIFY THOSE IN FORGIVEN INDIVIDUALS MAYBE THEY'RE MUCOSAL AND THEN REALLY WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS MAKE THE PUNISHMENT FIT THE CRIME SO IF I CAN
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00196	I WANT TO SAY IS MAKE THE PUNISHMENT FIT THE CRIME SO IF I CAN AH AH
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00197	AND THEN TARGET THAT APPROPRIATELY SO WE REALLY BALANCE EFFICACY OF AN AGENT OF A CRIME VERSUS RISK AND BENEFIT SO WE DO THE RIGHT THING TO TRY AND PREVENT FUTURE DISEASE.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00198	AND HOPEFULLY THIS WILL NOT ONLY WORK FOR RHEUMATRIAL THRUST IN THE FUTURE SO WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO READOUTS.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00199	RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS IN THE NEAR FUTURE SO WE'LL LOOK FOR TO READOUTS UM
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00200	ACTUALLY TRIALS ARE UNDERWAY NOW IN LUPUS THAT ARE SIMILAR AND DESIGNED TO STOP R A
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00202	TRIALS ARE UNDERWAY NOW AND LUPUS THAT ARE SIMILAR AND DESIGNED TO STOP R A.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00203	AND I INTERVENE EARLY TO PREVENT AN END ORGAN TOXICITY OR DAMAGE FROM THAT SO IT'S VERY EXCITING I THINK MANY OF YOU ALREADY KNOW ABOUT LOTS OF EXTENSIVE WORK IN TYPE 1 DIABETES SO I WON'T GO INTO THAT TODAY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00204	BUT THIS IS KIND OF THE BIG DREAM IF WE CAN DEVELOP MODELS TO TAKE SOMEBODY FROM A HEALTHY STANDPOINT FROM WHATEVER ORGAN YOU'RE INTERESTED IN
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00205	INTERVENE WITH STUDIES SUCH AS STOP R.A. DEVELOP WAYS TO PREVENT I THINK THAT'S THAT'S WHERE WE'D LIKE TO GO WITH RHEUMATOLOGY ARTHRITIS AND OTHER DISEASE FRANKLY I'M TIRED AS A RHEUMATOLOGIST TO WAIT UNTIL SICK PEOPLE COME INTO CLINIC IF WE CAN GO OUT FIND THEM EARLIER AND INTERVENE EARLIER I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE GREAT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00207	MY LAST SLIDE IS THERE'S TOO MANY PEOPLE TO PUT ON THIS SO I THANK SOME KEY PEOPLE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00209	TO THINK OF THERE'S TOO MANY PEOPLE TO THINK OF THERE'S TOO MANY PEOPLE TO THINK OF THERE'S TOO MANY PEOPLE TO THINK OF THERE'S TOO MANY PEOPLE TO THINK OF THERE'S TOO MANY PEOPLE TO THINK OF THERE'S TOO MANY PEOPLE TO THINK OF THERE'S TOO MANY PEOPLE TO THINK OF THERE'S TOO MANY PEOPLE TO THINK OF THERE'S TOO MANY PEOPLE TO THINK OF THERE'S TOO MANY PEOPLE TO THINK OF THERE'S TOO MANY PEOPLE TO THINK OF THERE'S TOO MANY PEOPLE TO THINK OF THERE'S TOO MANY PEOPLE TO THINK OF THERE'S TOO MANY PEOPLE TO THINK OF THERE'S TOO MANY PEOPLE TO THINK OF THERE'S TOO MANY PEOPLE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00210	THE ORIGINAL STUDIES WERE UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF THE STUDIES OF THE EDIOLOGISTS RHEUMATROTH RASTER SARAH MY COLLEAGUE CHRISTOPHER STREBEK AND OUR STATE COORDINATOR WHO'S DRIVEN FORWARD A LOT OF THIS MARIA FAZER HAVE BEEN HUGE HELP KRISTEN DEMERAL CHRISTY KUHN
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00211	ARE NOW DIVISION HEAD DUANE PEARSON HAVE BEEN HUGELY INSTRUMENTAL IN DRIVING A LOT OF THESE FORWARD WE'VE HAD LOTS OF FUNDING FROM LOTS OF AGENCIES MOSTLY I'D LIKE TO THANK THE NI
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00212	I'D LIKE TO THANK THE N I'D LIKE TO THANK THE N I'D LIKE TO THANK THE N I'D LIKE TO THANK THE N I'D LIKE TO THANK THE N I'D LIKE TO THANK THE N I'D LIKE TO THANK THE N I'D LIKE TO THANK THE N I'D LIKE TO THANK THE N I'D LIKE TO THANK THE N I'D LIKE TO THANK THE N I'D LIKE TO THANK THE N I'D LIKE TO THANK THE N I'D LIKE TO THANK THE N I'D LIKE TO THANK THE N I'D LIKE TO THANK THE N I'D LIKE TO THANK THE N I'D LIKE TO THANK THE N I'D LIKE TO THANK THE N I'D LIKE TO THANK THE N I'D LIKE TO THANK THE N I'D LIKE TO THANK THE N I'D LIKE TO THANK THE N I'D LIKE TO THANK THE N I'D LIKE TO THANK THE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00213	AND WITH THAT I WILL STOP AND LEAVE THIS SLIDE AND ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS I THINK I'VE STILL THE LAST TALK RIGHT I'VE GONE A LITTLE OVER BUT HOPEFULLY THERE'S TIME FOR QUESTIONS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00215	IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS YOU CAN PLEASE ENTER THEM IN THE CHAT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00217	I CAN SEE THE CHAT BUT I CAN SEE IT BETTER IF I STOP SHARE SO I'M GOING TO STOP SHARING IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00219	NATALIE MAYBE IF YOU CAN SEE I DON'T SEE ANY QUESTIONS IN THE CHAT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00220	I DON'T SEE ANY EITHER. I'M NOT MISSING ANYTHING.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00222	ALL RIGHT. I GUESS IF NOTHING IS COMING THROUGH, ARE WE DONE?
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00226	Where do ISGs fit into your evaluations?
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00228	SO WHAT IS AN ISG
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00230	SO INTERFERON SIMULATED GENES. THEY CERTAINLY DON'T FIT INTO ANY CLINICAL ASSESSMENTS OR LABORATORY ASSESSMENTS THAT YOU DO NOW.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00231	THAT'S IT THERE IS A GROWING UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE MAY BE AN INTERFERE ON SIGNAL
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00232	IN THE EARLY PRE-RA PERIOD. YOU'VE OPENED THE DOOR FOR A DISCUSSION HERE. WE DON'T THINK INTERFERON IS A HUGE PLAYER IN ESTABLISHED RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00233	AND IT LOOKED LIKE IT MIGHT BE FROM OLDER STUDIES INCLUDING SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION AND ARTICULAR INFLAMMATION THAT INTERFERON MIGHT PLAY A ROLE. INTERFERON BLOCKADE DID NOT WORK WELL.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00234	DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT IMPORTANT IN STABILITY DISEASE BUT AT LEAST THE DRUGS WE HAD DIDN'T WORK WELL WE THINK THAT ACTUALLY THEY MAY PLAY INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT PART IN THIS VERY EARLY PHASE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00235	SO THIS IS PART OF THAT PICTURE I SHOWED WHERE THINGS WE KNOW WORK AND ESTABLISH RHEUMATOID ATHLETES MAY ACTUALLY BE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE NEED TO USE IN EARLIER DISEASE AND SO
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00236	INTERFERON AND INTERFERON STIMULATED DISEASE ARE A NEW TARGET FOR THINKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF PRECLINICAL DISEASE BECAUSE MAYBE AT THAT EARLIER STAGE THESE ARE MUCH MORE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT PATHWAYS.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00237	THE CONCEPT IS THERE WE'RE TRYING TO NOW UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT PATHWAYS ARE THERE TO BE ABLE TO TARGET THEM EFFECTIVELY.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00239	ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM ANYONE?
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00241	WELL, DR. DEAN, THANK YOU. I APOLOGIZE OUR MODERATOR COULDN'T MAKE IT TODAY, BUT WE APPRECIATE YOUR SPEAKING.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00243	HEY THANKS THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY UH AND I THINK EVERYBODY HAS MY EMAIL FROM CAMPUS IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS COME UP LATER THANK YOU BYE
