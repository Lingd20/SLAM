YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00001	okay, so let me introduce our first speaker who is sim van der klooy.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00003	team fandarklu is the special projects advisor at wild animal initiative and also offers coaching and consulting to new effective animal advocacy groups.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00005	so right now i pass the microphone to you, sting.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00007	thank you, bianca. and thank you for carefully pronouncing my name. i appreciate it.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00008	and monica, too, also thanks for hosting this. i'm sure you're very tired on this last day, but from my perspective, at least, everything has gone very well these last two days.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00010	yeah, so i will switch now to sharing my screen. hopefully i can make that work.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00012	bye.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00014	let's see, if you cannot see this, can you signal? okay, great.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00016	so yeah, i think you don't have to be a manager to lead.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00018	and i will try to explain to you why today.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00020	so hello everyone, nice to see a whole bunch of familiar faces here. i appreciate that you're using your sunday afternoon for some people, sunday very early morning, to be here to learn how you can better protect animals.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00022	i just finished a sci-fi novel about anarchy. i am a product of colonialism. i don't depend on my work for money, and i have such issues with authority that i won't even follow recipe instructions.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00024	that is not my usual introduction to who steen van der ploeg is, but i think it's helpful for you to know where i'm coming from. so you feel encouraged to listen to me with an open mind to why i think you can and should lead even if you're not a manager.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00026	i hope you will be skeptical, not just of me, but of all leadership strategies you learn about. there are millions of books and classes and podcasts about leadership.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00027	but the hard data available is pretty limited. and on top of that, your personal experience, your cause, the structure of your organization, all influence what type of leadership works best in your situation and industry.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00029	to tell you a little bit more about my professional situation, i have worked at various nonprofits over 15 years in fundraising, administration, operations,
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00030	and i just started to work for wild animal initiatives.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00032	at wild animal initiative, my super smart and compassionate colleagues at this research institute work to understand and improve the lives of free ranging sentient animals.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00033	besides that work, i offer project-based support to new effective animal advocacy organizations, as bianca said earlier. i am lucky enough to do all my work for free without taking salaries.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00035	so the ideas i will share with you today have largely been stolen from these books and a bunch of others and from articles and podcasts, but also from various courses and classes.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00036	some directly about people management, others about critical thinking, effective altruism, diversity and inclusion, or negotiation. but most importantly,
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00038	i have learned from doing and i have learned from these people. these are some of my colleagues at the various charities i've worked for.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00039	and you can maybe pick me out in all of these pictures, but that might be a little bit difficult with how small the faces are.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00040	but yeah, i've learned more from these people than i have from reading and training or from reading and training combined.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00041	i've learned from making mistakes, from people's feedback, and through osmosis, being around people who lead and experiencing what works and what doesn't. and from talking and listening to these people.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00042	in the center, you also see me with my partner that was, i'm pretty sure, on my 40th birthday. he is a senior director at a software company.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00043	and i learn daily from his ideas, from his successes and his challenges. and he also gives me insight into how things are done in the corporate world, which i haven't had that much exposure to.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00045	so now you know how i learned the things i'll share, but what is it exactly that i hope you'll learn?
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00047	well, i will not blow your mind with novel ideas. i will share what i think are some common sense recommendations that you can try to turn into common practice.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00048	to me, leadership is about the impact you can have on others, irrespective of your authority. in this talk, i'll go over four ways to influence others so you can do more good together.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00049	i will explain why i think you should question ideas, plans, assumptions, and the behavior of your coworkers, including your managers.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00051	inspire your colleagues and show them the difference they make.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00053	support your coworkers' development, and connect with your team so people feel like they belong. these four pillars will strengthen your leadership. i hate the word strengthen. i cannot pronounce it.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00055	afterwards, i'd like to ask you what you think and hear about your experiences. and all the way at the end, we should have time to go over your questions in slido.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00057	so why do i think you should lead?
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00059	well, this whole presentation rests on four assumptions i have about you. i think you want to help more animals. you know, some interventions and work methods are more effective than others.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00061	you want to feel valued, like you make a difference, and like you belong.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00063	you want your co-workers to feel the same. so based on these assumptions, i believe it is your responsibility to try to lead your team and organization in the direction that helps the most animals. and those animals include your co-workers.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00065	it is not just your moral duty, i think, to stand up for what is right. we must try to do the most good we can.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00067	when you lead, you will prevent burnout.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00069	faunalytics found people leave animal organizations due to leadership and burnout.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00070	your leadership can improve team spirit, create a trusting, open and safe environment, contribute to a known blame culture, and show the difference your collective work is making.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00072	this will make it less likely that you or the people on your team will suffer from mental and physical stress and exhaustion.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00074	you will help more animals.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00076	as you might have heard jamie say yesterday, animal advocacy careers found ceos and hiring professionals in effective animal advocacy organizations identified leadership as one of the most urgent skill gaps in our movement.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00077	so your leadership will make the movement more effective. you can help fill those gaps.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00079	practicing leadership will also lead to personal growth.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00081	you gain more confidence, you feel more in control, and you strengthen not just your professional, but also your personal relationships.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00083	but leading when you're not in management is not always easy. some people might not appreciate what you do. hierarchical organizations and managers stuck to their ways might label you difficult.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00085	but you will have to stand up for what is right. you must take responsibility for how you and your colleagues are treated.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00087	and you can make a difference. you can save more animals and you can probably experience more joy in your work than you think you can.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00089	so to get to the first point,
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00091	question ideas, plans, assumptions, and behavior.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00093	it is normal in each of our countries to use animals as products, to see them as things, to kill and eat them. you grew up and still live in a culture where few people questioned those norms, but you did.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00094	it didn't matter that most people followed the customs of animal abuse. you felt it was wrong, did research, and are working to change the status quo.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00096	you can use that same curiosity, humility, and moral compass of yours to make your organization more effective.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00098	like maybe you don't like the performance reviews or how meetings are run, or maybe you wonder why some specific tasks are important for animals to lead better lives. is there evidence for that? did someone test if this works best?
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00100	the managers and executives in your organization might also not have the full picture or fully grasp what the day-to-day work on the ground is like. your perspective is helpful in finding the best option.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00102	because of your position, you might also be better at taking the lead on certain issues. as someone without hierarchical authority, you are not likely to be blinded by the power you have. multiple studies have shown
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00103	that power and privilege influence one's ability to make evidence-based decisions with an open mind.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00105	wisdom, according to plato and a bunch of other people since then, is knowing what you know and knowing what you don't.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00107	it can be harder for the people in charge to know what they don't know. you on the other hand might be better able to think critically how an operation system or a corporate campaign could work.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00109	and you must share that perspective. so ask why repeatedly. what's the purpose of what you're doing?
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00111	knowing why something is important for the mission to succeed and how it works will make it easier for you to do it. you asking questions will also make it easier for others to speak up. why does this meeting lead to save more animals?
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00112	why does this cage-free strategy lead to less suffering? why are these people on your governing board?
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00114	when you dig into these whys, you clarify the work for others.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00116	then be nosy and noisy or be curious and difficult.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00118	if you are the smart and silent type who fixes mistakes without confronting the error makers, you actually are undermining organizational learning.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00119	if you think something could possibly be done better, but you don't speak up, you might say fewer animals. so please be nosy and noisy.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00121	and don't forget to question your own ideas and actions either. is what you're doing really the best way to get results? how do you know? maybe ask the opinion of someone who's willing to disagree with you.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00123	then inspire.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00125	how show people how the difference, what the difference is that we can make together.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00127	fonalytics, again, great organization. they found that dissatisfaction with a type of advocacy and not feeling like you make a difference are big reasons that people leave animal advocacy movement.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00129	you can reconnect people to their motivation. you can help them see the impact they have by inspiring people you like them into action. so together we can do it.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00131	billions of farmed animals will continue to be murdered every year.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00133	we still know very little about the experiences of animals in the wild, let alone about how to sustainably reduce their suffering. those facts are bleak.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00135	but i'm absolutely confident that we are building the roads towards the future in which humanity cares for animals. the actions we take today can spare a vast number of animals a lifetime of suffering just years from now.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00137	so many fishes, chickens, tadpoles, pigs, i cannot even imagine. they'll have better lives.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00139	it is difficult and much stands in our way, but together we can build not just roads, but rockets to a better future.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00141	i hope you remember this and remind each other when things get hard, that our work makes a difference for real individuals.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00143	make the invisible clear. spreadsheets make animals happier.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00145	sometimes we need to do things that seem far removed from protecting animals.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00147	filling out spreadsheets, raising money, creating budgets, administration, we're not all rescuing foxes from fur farms. remind yourself and others how mundane tasks relate to a better world.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00148	when i compare last year's average donations to this year's, that means i will have more information to raise more money next time.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00149	and with more money at wild animal initiative, we can hire more researchers and learn more about how we can give animals the lives they prefer.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00151	be impatient for a better future. we can make a difference and we must make a difference. our work is not just important, it is urgent.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00152	the more time and energy we waste, the more animals will suffer. the smarter we work, the quicker we will find ways to help animals.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00154	remind each other of this and model that urgency.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00156	celebrate wins.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00158	big and small milestones must be celebrated. no, countless hens roaming in a barn without sunlight, laying eggs without ever raising children is not good.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00159	but a switch to that from tiny cages means less pain, it means more expensive eggs, it means we are a step closer to liberation. it's like we pass a test on the way to graduation. it deserves a reward.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00161	and when you celebrate individual achievements, make it specific. don't just say, uh, a partner work day and night to create a beautiful vegan video.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00163	explain why that is an important step on the way to animal liberation. if instead you say, "'this video she worked on so hard "'will make it easier for our message to spread,'
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00164	for people to be inspired to eat better food. thanks to aparna's work, fewer animals will be killed for food.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00166	tie that celebration not to the input, the hard work, but to the impact someone makes.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00168	make sure you feel good when you do good. help others feel successful. helping others feel successful will lead them to continue to want to do their critical work.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00170	visualize the peaceful world we want to live in and how we are getting there together.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00172	develop. develop and grow other leaders. i'm not sure about you, though i think you do too. i want to grow. i want to become a better person than i am today.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00174	i want to get better at protecting animals. i cannot do that alone. i need to learn from the people around me who have different perspectives on the impact i make and who have different knowledge and experience.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00176	a leader actively takes on the role of supporting people to become their best selves.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00177	because not only does that mean you give someone the opportunity to be better, it means the organization will be better at achieving its goals.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00179	and you don't have to be a manager to do this. we each have some insights or abilities that others on our teams do not. if you share those, you develop others.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00181	give feedback.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00183	positive feedback, being explicit about how my action led to helping more animals is an incredible motivator.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00185	giving constructive feedback, genuinely aimed at helping me be better, that is specific and timely, makes me think you believe i have greater potential.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00187	that you trust me enough to have challenging conversations. for many, the best reward is attention. and i fully believe in positive reinforcement and leading by example.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00188	but ignoring unproductive behavior can mean robbing people of the opportunity to grow. denying people a chance to improve, in my opinion, is short-sighted, cowardice, and selfish behavior.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00190	individuals who believe their talents can be developed through hard work, good strategies and input from others.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00192	they tend to achieve more than people with a more fixed mindset, those who believe their talents are innate gifts. and if we believe making mistakes is good, as kirstie will show later today, then we need feedback.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00194	share your knowledge. i need access to knowledge, so i don't waste time reinventing the wheel. when you share books, articles, strategies, and ideas with me, i feel like you have the expectation i can grow.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00196	i admit that in the past, i might not have always shared knowledge so that i could remain the sole expert, so that i could feel necessary.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00197	but the fear of becoming obsolete is one you must overcome. leaders share knowledge. they don't hide it.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00199	they succeed when they help people become better than they are.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00201	model good behavior. when i see someone successfully coach others, communicate bad news transparently and with compassion or ask for comments and deal with critical feedback well, i have examples to copy from.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00203	be aware of how your attitude and actions influence others' perceptions of what is acceptable and good. monkey see, monkey do.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00205	share space.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00207	invite people to participate. it doesn't come natural to everyone to speak up or to step into new situations. but testing new things is important for my growth.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00208	when i am put in stretch opportunities and when i am invited to take up space, that becomes easier.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00210	if there are people on your team who you know are capable of more than they have shown, or who might have good ideas but don't usually speak up, you can create openings for them to participate. invite them in the conversation.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00211	you can help people get over their insecurity, to get over that threshold of speaking up,
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00213	say, hey, sara, didn't you have a similar experience with x? what is your perspective? or ivan, i have only heard from the usuals, but what are the questions you have on this topic?
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00215	our success is highly independent on that of others.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00217	connect. connect to create a supportive collection, a collective. your work can be emotionally taxing. the cruelty,
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00219	and suffering of animals seems endless. our achievements are incremental.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00221	we need support to continue to do this work. moreover, it is critical to provide the psychological safety where people can openly talk about the things that went wrong and might go wrong.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00222	if you weren't there on friday, i recommend you watch anya's talk, who spoke specifically about creating psychological safety.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00224	people won't share ideas if they do not feel they belong.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00226	create a collective of allies. and here i'm actually going to disagree a tiny bit with anya and christina who spoke on friday. i don't think you need to be friends with the people you work with.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00228	we are less like a family and more like a sports team with a common goal. friend groups can feel like cliques with outsiders.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00230	i think we need allies, people you can depend on to help you do your best work, who you hold accountable and who hold you accountable. you have the most important connection with your colleagues, you all want to help animals.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00232	i don't want you to listen to me because we have the same cultural background, but because i have a good idea. and i need you to be critical of my suggestions.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00233	and your opinion of them should not be colored by a mutual love for the music of joy division.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00235	we need to trust that when we disagree, we do so because we want to get to a point of better understanding how we can improve lives. we need relationships we can count on.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00237	to form a collective, a network of allies, build one-on-one relationships with people, but more importantly, support relationships between other people. make introductions between people who could support each other or learn from each other.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00239	check-in. people do their best work when they feel a sense of belonging.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00241	to create that inclusion, for many that means they need people to check in with them, especially in times of crisis. if you are a queer advocate in poland right now, your identity, your existence is basically threatened.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00242	doing your work now is even harder than normal. show each other compassion.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00244	be kind and supportive. see how other people are doing and not just the ones you naturally gravitate towards. remember what you have in common and show up for each other.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00246	speak up for each other in two ways. first, amplify voices, especially marginalized ones. if someone isn't listened to because they're not included or because they aren't as loud or as respected,
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00247	you can repeat their points and attribute their ideas to them. this will make them feel heard and part of the team, and better decisions can be made.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00249	then speak up for each other, call them bad behavior. when someone uses disrespectful language or shows their bias, ask what they mean or explain why it can feel harmful.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00250	if you don't, you give your silent approval and encourage an environment of harassment.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00252	you can help create a brave space of belonging where only people's ideas are judged, not their identity.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00254	when i know you have my back, it will be easier for me to speak up for myself and for others.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00256	if people feel they are happy in their place of work, turnover is low and more people want to join your group.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00258	and you deliver better work as a collective than you do as a collection of individuals.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00260	so all these four things are connected. each of the competencies support and reinforce each other.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00262	without asking questions, without fully understanding why our methods are the best and how mundane tasks relate to the mission, it is hard to inspire each other about our ability to change the world.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00263	and without inspiration, without believing you can make a difference, what interest do i have to develop and grow?
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00265	and if you do not develop, if you hoard your knowledge and don't invite people to participate, it will be less likely to feel like they have a part, that they are a part of a connected collective.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00267	and without people feeling like they are connected and valued, like they are judged on the validity of their ideas and not their character, they won't feel free to question the strategy that the organization is taking.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00269	there are four skills listed in the center circle. communication, critical thinking, feedback, and dei stands for diversity, equity, and inclusion.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00271	learning about and practicing these core skills will help you get better at acting on the four leadership competencies around it. each of these four skills deserve their own full task, if not full day multi sessions.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00272	so i can't go over all of them here.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00274	but i do want to go over diversity, equity and inclusion briefly, because i think it's especially important for our movement now. we must care about humans.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00276	research has shown we won't be as effective as organizations and as a movement without representation on our teams of the diversity of people.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00277	without people feeling like they belong, and without everyone being equally likely to achieve success.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00279	so diversity to me means people with different identities and ways of thinking are represented. equity, people have what they need to thrive. and inclusion, people are heard and feel like they belong.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00281	i also believe that it is not just important for us to be more effective in our animal advocacy. i think it is our moral responsibility to create equity.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00282	if we are apathetic to injustice and don't stand up for people who might not be in the room, we consent to the status quo of oppression.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00284	there are many forms of exclusion plaguing our movement, sexism, ableism, heteronormativity, but i want to call out in particular anti-blackness and the need to incorporate anti-racism in our work.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00285	i recommend you seek out encompass movement to learn more about how to create racial justice in the animal advocacy space.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00287	i also want to show you how i think dei, these three concepts, are important for the four competencies i discussed.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00289	questioning.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00290	numerous studies have shown that diversity on your teams can create a work culture that is better at making more informed decisions.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00292	because when you're all friends or like-minded people, it is very easy to get on the same smooth wavelength and produce ideas you each believe in.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00294	but it also means you're more likely to miss out on certain thoughts. on the other hand, when your team consists of people with very different life experience or different thinking patterns, deciding on strategy might feel a bit more like a struggle.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00295	but ideas are considered from more angles.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00297	encouraging diversity, both cognitive and identity-based, will encourage more questions.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00299	then inspire.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00301	we need to inspire everyone on our teams to deliver our best work. it will be very hard to motivate people that we can fight this massive battle together if some are excluded and feel like they do not belong.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00303	develop.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00305	people of color and other marginalized persons are often less likely to succeed because they have less access to learning opportunities and mentorship, while at the same time they are forced to live up to higher standards.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00307	connecting. as a team member, you can help create a sense of inclusion. and without inclusion, people will not feel free to share their ideas, nor will people be open to listening to yours.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00308	learn to recognize the way bias influences behavior and how it seeps into organizational systems so you can change them.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00310	question yourself and listen to coworkers and people outside your community with an open mind.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00312	this will help you incorporate anti-oppression in your leadership.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00314	without it, we are less effective. without it, we won't have justice. we are all animals.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00316	in summary,
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00318	you can make an impact on your coworkers or and your organization and your mission, irrespective of your authority.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00320	question how people and plans in your organization lead to better lives for animals. ask critical questions about the direction of your organization.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00322	inspire the people you work with. show them the difference your hard work together makes for animals.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00324	develop others ability to make impact, support them in their growth and connect, build relationships and make sure individuals feel like they belong.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00326	so.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00328	that is the majority of all i wanted to share with you today. so what's left is some questions i have for you, hoping that we can all learn from each other's experience.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00329	feel free to type in the chat box or to unmute yourself to share your thoughts. and i have three questions for you and once we have gone through them,
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00330	there should be time for your slido questions. so which one of my ideas will you try out?
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00332	and i'm going to remain uncomfortably quiet until someone speaks up or chats up. bianca or monica, if you're still here, could you help me read the if there's any chats.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00334	okay, everyone. so i just want to encourage you, as stine said before, to answer her questions in the chat. or if you have any questions, you can ask through slido.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00336	and lukasz says voicing concerns or questions even more actively.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00338	sofia says, or it will write in the chat, repeating quiet people's ideas and attributing them to that person.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00340	natalie, celebrate small victories for the animals more.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00342	elena lovatovich, hip, she
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00344	matthew says he's gonna try celebrating small milestones and giving people feedback.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00346	so let me see what time it is.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00348	then next question, which one of my ideas will be challenging for you? or maybe what are some ideas that you don't agree with?
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00350	that you think i should change my mind about?
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00352	i don't see anyone that would write something right now in the group chat. so maybe it's not that challenging.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00353	yeah.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00355	maybe for example, for me, a lot of the most challenging things are, for example, prevent the burnout and
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00357	well, doing most of these things and engage every day. okay, and we have the first given more from natalie, given more feedback is challenging, but very important.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00359	then from thomas,
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00361	i think you can be too annoying. it can slow a process if everyone is critical of everything all the time.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00363	then, mariana.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00365	exactly. feedback is definitely the most challenging.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00367	yeah, i have to agree with that. i think for me also, both giving and receiving feedback is difficult. and there is a lot to learn for that.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00369	then last question, something that in the questionnaire, or i think the survey,
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00370	that animal advocacy careers did. a lot of ceos and leaders said that communication is a super important management skill or a leadership skill.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00371	but that can mean a million things from like being good at speaking externally or delivering nice presentations. but what does it mean to you to communicate well as a leader?
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00373	okay, so again, we have some more comments from tanya. good communication all comes down to listening.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00374	and then from ishita, i didn't know if i pronounced the name right, but i hope so. not just hearing, but also understanding what someone has to say.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00375	then from mika, positioning yourself at the same level as others.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00377	natalie have a really clear purpose being able to explain why we are doing certain things.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00379	and from lina, that there are no misunderstandings.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00381	i think those are all very great points.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00382	yeah, i think so too.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00384	those were all the questions i have for you. and besides all the books i have read and the many more i still want to read,
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00385	i think, anja, again, sorry, i keep calling you out if you're here. you also had some great book recommendations, and i think many others do too.
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00386	and these are some other sources that i have mentioned or that you can find online to read more about leadership practices and especially don't forget your co-workers.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00002	hi, i'm pete sindon, chief information officer at genomics england, and today i'm here to discuss how research is being used to deliver personalized care.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00004	genomics is a groundbreaking area of medicine. it uses a person's unique genetic code to help diagnose, treat, and prevent illness.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00005	advanced technology now lets scientists compare genetic code across thousands of people to make new discoveries and continually improve health care.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00007	jessica is a four-year-old girl. she has a rare genetic condition that causes epilepsy and affects her movement and general development.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00008	throughout the early years of her life, she's been given mris, lumbar punctures, eegs to measure brain waves, and many other diagnostics, none of which revealed her particular condition.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00010	through the 100,000 genome project, jessica received a diagnosis. genomics pinpointed a change to one of her genes that was not present in either of her parents. they now know that jessica has glut1 deficiency syndrome.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00011	she doesn't produce enough of the protein that transports glucose from the blood to the fluid around the brain.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00013	but jessica can now control her epilepsy by adopting a special ketogenic diet, low in carbohydrates and high in protein.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00014	this understanding directly improved the life of a child, and applying the process at scale can improve the lives of many children and adults alike.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00016	furthermore, the parents now know that the condition was not inherited. if they decide to have more children, they will not have the same condition, essential for their peace of mind.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00018	rare disease is very common.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00020	while each disease is individually rare, there are over 7,000 rare diseases
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00022	collectively, one of 17 people has a rare disease, and that represents over 400 million people globally.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00024	80% of rare diseases have a genetic cause patients will wait on average four years for diagnosis and 95% of them will have no approved treatment.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00026	this is an area of medicine with a significant potential for advancing science and improving lives, this is why rare disease was a major focus of 100,000 genome project for which genomics england was originally established.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00028	investment in research to further understand and treat these conditions is critical and high impact. genomics england sits at the heart of the uk's ecosystem in enabling genomic research and making genomics clinically accessible.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00029	we work alongside friends in the uk medical family from nhs england to biobank, hdr uk and nihr.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00030	our systems are used by several thousand academic researchers, by biotech and by pharma.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00032	we have deep technical and genomic specialist partnerships with the likes of aws, lifebit, illumina, congenica, nvidia and oxford nanopore.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00034	we exist in part through central government funding and in part through research funding.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00036	genomics england is a key facilitator in the transition to personalised, predictive and preventative genomic healthcare.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00038	we work with the nhs to deliver and improve genomic testing that helps doctors diagnose, treat and prevent illness, starting with cancer and rare disease.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00039	a minimum of 20,000 whole genome sequences are expected to be processed during 2021.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00041	at the same time, we provide health data and advanced technology needed by researchers to make new medical discoveries and develop more effective targeted medicines for patients and their families.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00043	together, these two halves of the infinity loop reinforce each other. advances in research can be incorporated into clinical care.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00045	patients receiving clinical care can consent to be included in research data to support medical advances. in doing this, we create a virtuous circle.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00047	this slide shows that genomics doesn't just apply to rare disease. this slide relates to cancer.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00049	in this instance, an individual presented with a brain tumour, but the clinician suspected the brain tumor was not the primary source of the cancer. by analyzing tumor mutation burden, which is a measure of the mutations in the dna of the cancer cells,
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00050	it was possible to identify that the primary source was likely colorectal, lung or malignant melanoma.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00052	by further analyzing transversions, a process whereby c bases are changed to a bases in the genomic code, it was possible to show that the likely cause was dna damage from inhaling benzoprene. benzoprene is a carcinogen prevalent in cigarette smoke.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00054	by using these two techniques together, the primary disease type was identified as lung cancer and in this instance was treatable with immunotherapy, stimulating the immune system to kill the cancer cells.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00057	through the 100,000 genome project, over 110,000 genomes have been contributed by approximately 90,000 participants for research purposes.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00058	over 70,000 of those relate to rare disease from the individuals affected and in the majority of cases from their family members.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00059	over 17,000 cancer patients have contributed both germline and tumor sequences. over the last year, individuals have also contributed genomes to help understand covid-19 and the variation in severity of the disease.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00060	this is building to an additional 35,000 genomes.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00062	the genomic data sits alongside clinically relevant data to provide a rich phenotypic genotypic environment for detailed analysis.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00063	clinical data includes hospital episode statistics, mortality data, a range of cancer-specific information, and exit questionnaires from clinicians, indicating, for example, whether specific variants could explain the phenotype.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00065	in some instances, imaging and primary care data are also linked.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00067	this slide shows the spread of genomes between rare disease types. there are significant numbers relating to neurological development disorders, along with many other classes of disease.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00069	when logged into our research environment, these can be explored and segmented in many ways to find the right cohort of participants for your particular study.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00071	and this slide shows the spread of participants by cancer type. as expected, you see greater numbers of the more prevalent breast, colorectal, and lung cancers. cancer patients cover both somatic mutations, those that occur from damage to genes,
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00072	in an individual during the person's life, and germline mutations, those that are passed on directly from a parent to a child at the time of conception.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00074	following the successful completion of the 100,000 genome project, genomics england has undergone a transformation from project to platform. our next chapter involves working with patients, doctors and scientists to improve the genomic testing in the nhs,
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00075	and help researchers access the health data and technology they need to make new medical discoveries and create more effective, targeted medicines for everybody.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00077	the more genomes are analysed, the more discoveries can be made, and the better future care will be. our transition from self-managed infrastructure to aws cloud is an essential enabler in scaling our offering to enable such research.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00079	researchers can access the genomic and clinical data outland above by using genomic england's trusted research environment. gel has partnered with innovative british deep tech company lifebit and is using global cloud provider aws to power the platform.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00080	the platform provides immediate access to tooling required to define and explore a cohort of individuals based on genomic or phenotypic stratification.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00081	the platform enables data exploration and makes it simple for researchers to execute pipelines and other jobs.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00083	researchers can introduce cutting-edge analytical tools of their choice through docker containers, link those tools securely with their own data,
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00084	and conduct research across all data sources in private workspaces that are audited, protected and controlled by gel's strict information governance policies.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00086	but why use a research environment?
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00088	in addition to protection of individual privacy, there are four key reasons to use the trusted research environment. firstly, the data sets involved are enormous.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00089	the data is too big to move efficiently. it cannot readily be achieved with a sensible time frame or cost. as the data grows, this becomes an ever increasing constraint.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00090	by way of example, when genomics england moved its own data from one storage system to another, it took nine months for the full copy.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00092	secondly, technology now makes it relatively simple to bring the analytics to the data, increasing speed and lowering cost. this is becoming a common paradigm for distributed analysis of very large data sets.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00094	through lifebits cloud os, each researcher receives their own clean room environment, separate to any other, from which they can access all of the genomics england's data alongside their own data,
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00095	the fully managed service provides maximum utility without sacrificing security or control.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00097	thirdly, investing in hardware and establishing an environment is a drag on innovation. it's not a good use of time for data scientists or bioinformaticians.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00099	and lastly, the common environment enables ready collaboration between research teams, while each has their own environment, they have the ability to collaborate wherever they wish.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00101	cloud brings significant opportunities to research.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00103	you can begin rapidly with no need to purchase, install or manage hardware. by piggybacking on an established research environment, you can scale research immediately with all security, identity management and data ingestion ready and waiting.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00105	a well governed cloud platform is more secure than self managed infrastructure.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00106	a pay-as-you-go model means you only need to pay for what you use,
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00107	federation of data becomes simpler, integrating data securely. federation across environments is a critical direction of travel, and we fully support the efforts of the ga4gh community.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00109	the cloud provides significant 11.9's resilience. this allows us to divert more effort into enabling genomic research over managing platform stability.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00111	and in a world where genomics is at the bleeding edge of high performance compute, we can always benefit from the latest available technology without being concerned with capital investment and depreciation life cycles.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00113	while the benefits of cloud are undeniable, there's a journey to setting up a high functioning analytics platform. genomics england, we've made the investment so that you don't need to.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00114	some challenges that we have addressed are such.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00116	high-performance computing is a specialized end of computing. with the help of intel and aws, we tackled the performance and configuration questions head on.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00118	and intel support enabled us to embed architectural changes from which all users now benefit.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00120	we looked at several classes of common jobs. a simple gwas, a standard genomic function, saw a five-fold improvement in speed and a ten-fold reduction in cost.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00122	on an out-of-the-box configuration, a complex but frequent job took 25 hours to run.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00123	after our investment, we were able to reduce the compute time from 25 hours to 23 seconds. this is a generic improvement for all such workloads.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00125	this investment that we put in alongside our partners matters for all future research and costs research based on instance type selected and compute time used.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00127	migrating existing services is a non-trivial matter. through our close partnership with aws migration assistance program, we've planned to move complex interdependent services running over nearly 1,000 virtual machines.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00129	and our final challenge is the funding model. while commercial entities see the benefit of pay-as-you-go services, the academic grant funding mechanism is less ready for the concept. we're looking to see how to best manage that with our partners, through the operating model, and potentially with centralized funding.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00131	to wrap up, we're now at a point where we've proven the value in genomic analysis and are seeing whole genome sequencing being embedded in clinical pathways.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00132	through a year of covid, genomics has entered the common language. the next phase is scaling. with more data, we can collectively conduct more analyzes and generate new personalized therapeutics, diagnostics and preventative treatments.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00133	the potential global impact is enormous. our environments are established not so that we can conduct research, but so that you can.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00134	if you'd like to get involved, please do contact us via partnerships at genomicsengland.co.uk. more information can be found by following the qr code.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00135	we welcome collaborations with academia, biotech, pharma and others interested in using genomics to turn science into healthcare using technology.
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00137	thank you for your time.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00002	i'm going to get rid of the meeting controls really quickly too.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00004	all right. hi, guys. i'm emma.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00005	i'm emily.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00006	and we are from pitt dance marathon and today we're going to talk a little bit about implementing effective stewardship for your dance marathon.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00008	so in our presentation, we'll talk about the two pronged approach that we take at pdm to donor stewardship, including stewarding as an organization and stewarding as for individuals.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00009	and some examples of both of those and what we did in our program this year and then ways that other dance marathons can implement them and those methods into their programs in the future.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00011	so we take a two pronged approach to
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00013	stewarding in terms of that from an individual point of view and that from an organizational standpoint.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00014	so in terms of individual stewardship, this refers to the resources and plans that are implemented for participants and staff members to use, where they themselves are encouraged to thank those who have donated to their fundraising efforts.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00015	so this includes templates and outlines that we provide to every individual involved in pdm to send out once they receive donations from different individuals.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00016	and then organizational stewardship, which refers to the stewarding efforts that are done on behalf of all of pitt dance marathon.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00017	so this includes emails that are sent out from pdm to all donors, to specific categories of donors, that sort of thing.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00019	you're probably wondering why we do this in the first place. and really it's because it covers that all of the bases. so some people donate because they're supporting the person that's raising the money.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00020	but other people may donate because they really just want to support the cause, no matter who the fundraiser is.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00021	so, for money donors, it's a combination of the two. so using this two pronged approach changes the form of thank you, that will be most effective for each individual donor.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00022	so those that donated to support the individual fundraiser will typically feel more touched and appreciated whenever that person reaches out to them directly.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00023	whether it's an email, a text, thank you card, anything like that.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00024	but those that are more attached to the entire cause of dance marathons will really appreciate the acknowledgement of their contribution from the entire organization.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00025	appreciating the overall thank you as well as any updates from the organization or new information we can provide them following their donation.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00026	this also helps disperse the responsibility and the workload of stewardship because it encourages individual staff members and participants to make the efforts of thanking their donors
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00027	so that the stewardship chair or committee or whatever you may have at your dance marathon isn't as responsible for sending out individual text messages or thank yous to each single donor.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00028	this wouldn't be as effective anyway because whoever's in charge of stewardship won't know each and every donor as well as each fundraiser will. so this makes it way more impactful and personalized.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00030	so focusing on stewarding as an organization, one of the main goals and main items in terms of stewarding as an organization is the high level of consistency in organizational skills.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00031	that it requires because of the quantity of individuals, groups, and companies to be thanked. so depending on the size of your dance marathon, there are hundreds or thousands of donors in a given year.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00032	which is an extremely large list of names to keep track of and stay on top of thinking. so we found that it's super important to create and maintain a robust list of donors by pulling frequent reports from donor drive to keep track of all of the donors.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00033	so we typically find it most useful to organize these donors into different categories.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00034	and create different excel spreadsheets and that sort of things based on different characteristics, such as those who have donated multiple times, those who have donated over $100, different kind of characteristics like that.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00035	and so it's extremely helpful in breaking all of this down to keep track of each individual's different contributions. and then creating this robust list that you maintain and can source from donordrive.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00036	easily allows you to personalize emails that will be going to a group. so even though it's just the organization sending a mass email, so to speak, so you still will be sending an email to maybe a few hundred people at one time,
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00037	it is more specific in terms of acknowledging exactly what they donated.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00038	and gave to the cause. so for example, if you break it down into who donated $50, who donated $100, who donated $200, and et cetera,
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00039	this gives you smaller cohorts of donors so you can provide them information on how much their donation will support the children's hospital or children's miracle network, for example. so
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00040	you can include more personalized details such as, as a donor of over $50, you were able to provide x to a child at the hospital.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00041	and this in general just gets them more connected to the cause and allows them to see what type of impact their donations are having.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00042	and again, it's just a way to make it a little bit more personalized while still being able to send it out to large cohorts of donors.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00044	and what's most important is to get creative. the more creative that your organization can get in ways of thanking and stewarding donors, the more exciting it is for those donors.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00045	they don't necessarily just want an email that says, thank you for donating to our dance marathon. they really like unique things. it helps them feel more appreciated and more recognized.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00046	so personalizing emails for different groups like this is one of the easiest ways to improve on the mass email method, as well as sending virtual postcards or thank you cards to those who have donated a lot of money to you.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00048	work with your marketing team or whoever may be in charge of graphics on your team to create cute designs and interesting concepts.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00049	maybe they tie into your overall branding as an organization or your campaign, or if you had a theme for your push day, anything like that, it really helps to elevate the stewardship materials.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00051	so one of our biggest initiatives at pdm this year for stewardship was our stewardship spotlights during our dance marathon.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00052	so once an hour, there was a slot of a few minutes set aside for prepared stewardship shout outs, where we would get on stage and recognize and applaud some of our top donors.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00053	so this came in the form of thanking all of the businesses that donated to our organization in any way over the past year, thanking and shouting out highest fundraisers of the hour, day, year, and so on.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00055	so we did this to dedicate explicit time during all of the craziness and fun happening during our main event to thank everybody who made a big impact on the reveal at the end of the day.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00057	we wanted to incorporate these spotlights after performers, so that way there'd be a large crowd by the stage, so that more and more people could recognize our donors and the people that made our fundraising possible.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00059	during these times, we even called up certain people to the stage to applaud and thank them if they were at our event.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00060	as well as inviting representatives from the businesses that had donated to us to come to our event so they could be recognized on the stage.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00062	so now switching over to the second prong of individual stewardship.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00063	so individual stewardship is always a bit difficult, we have found in terms of actually getting people outside of staff members to use the resources that are provided.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00064	and take the time and effort to properly steward, recognize and thank their donors. so we found that creating templates and email drafts and text examples is great, but if not many people actually use them, it kind of defeats the point.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00065	so this year, one of our main goals in terms of stewardship for our dance marathon was to increase participant stewardship. so try to get as many participants as possible, not just staff members to thank those participants.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00066	that had donated to them.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00068	and supported them in meaningful ways. so this involved not only figuring out how to distribute resources, but how to get participants to use the resources that we had created as well.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00069	so the main idea for individual stewardship in trying to achieve this goal in this effort was creating and implementing what we call the stewardship matrix.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00070	so essentially this was a chart that gave a recommendation of what stewarding effort or method the individual should use to thank a donor dependent on the amount that the person donated.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00071	so, for example, if a person donated over $100, we suggested and gave the individual resources to send those people a virtual thank you card.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00072	so the thought behind this was really that it was a clear, if we gave a clear cut, simple guideline and method for people to follow, it would provide a bare minimum in a sense that people would be encouraged to follow.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00073	because almost all of the work was done for them. if it was laid out,
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00074	based on who to send what to based on their amount of donations. and so obviously if they wanted to do more than what we had on the matrix, that was wonderful and encouraged, but the hope was that individuals would see the provided
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00075	and participants would see the provided instructions and guidance and follow it.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00077	so on the next slide is an example of our matrix. this was our matrix during a fundraising push day that we had in the spring.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00078	the matrix was easily modifiable depending on the event or situation that we were using it for, but this is an example for the spring push day.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00079	so as you can see, it gives guidance on what stewardship methods to take, depending on how much a donor donated to them.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00080	and along with this, we had all of the resources linked in the matrix so that people could easily go find the email and text and send it right away.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00081	or instructions for virtual thank you cards with the link, all of that sort of thing. everything extremely prepared.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00082	so that people could use the simple guidelines and not require much effort to hopefully increase their participation in our stewardship efforts.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00084	so in terms of distribution, like we mentioned, distributing the individual stewardship materials is a very important part of the plan. and for this, we teamed up with the marketing and recruitment panels of our organization.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00085	so whoever is in charge of the communication between participants or creating the different graphics and materials that you put out on social media, that sort of thing,
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00086	is who we'd recommend working with for this part of the plan.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00087	so we had our recruitment team send out the materials in their participant emails while having marketing sharing the information on social media. so posting the materials in advance of the event.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00088	as well as during the day of. so giving constant and easy access to everything a person could need for thanking their donors.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00089	so we had marketing repost examples of people using the methods outlined in the matrix on the instagram story throughout the day, which is a reminder for people to thank their donors. and again, the resources were right there on social media
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00090	or in their email inbox, or groupme, or whatever method you may use.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00091	and we just kept encouraging throughout the day to remember to use the provided materials that we had given that were clear cut right there for them.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00093	so in terms of success, this was by no means a 100% successful effort. there were still people that didn't necessarily take the initiative to thank their donors, even with
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00094	these templates, but we did see a very significant increase in the number of participants that were stewarding their donors.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00095	we also received amazing feedback from participants that they use the matrix because it was easy to use and didn't take a lot of time or effort on their part.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00096	they also commented that they really appreciated all the stewarding materials being found in one location. so that way, all of it was easy to access, easy to locate, and easy to come back to, to thank their donors next time as well.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00098	now in terms of implementing what we did this year at pdm into other programs, nothing that we did in terms of stewardship at pdm this year was super specific to our program.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00099	meaning that it can easily be replicated and utilized and adapted and in other dance marathon programs. so, for example, with the stewardship matrix, it can definitely be tailored to whatever your program is.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00100	needs and whatever. so like you can put in your organization's favorite form of stewardship, previous templates that you've created, using as an organization tool in that way.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00101	and tailor it more specifically to your organization that way. and if you have a lot of donors who donate high amounts of money, for example, you can alter the matrix to reflect this and making it go to higher levels versus
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00102	ours during push days where we had just a general 249 plus category. so if you have lots of donors who donate larger amounts of money, you can continue to provide guidance for higher amounts of donations.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00103	and then in terms of stewardship spotlights, they're also a super easy but effective way to recognize, thank and applaud some of the highest donors. and this can be easily done during any of your dance marathons and your main events.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00104	just setting aside a few minutes, an hour, or however your organization wants to do it. it's easy to set aside, especially when you're doing it right from the beginning, to set aside a few five minute segments throughout the day.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00105	for someone to get up on stage and acknowledge the top donors, important companies, all that sort of thing.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00107	so just in general, focusing on stewardship and organization and organizational stewardship will help to cover all the basis in thanking your donors, because it's much better for them to receive thank yous from individuals and
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00108	and the organization rather than receive a thank you from no one. just as it's better to thank them at multiple points throughout the year as compared to not thanking them a single time.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00109	so that was kind of the motivation behind our stewardship efforts this year. and i think that you can take a lot of the different methods that we utilize
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00110	and easily adapt them and adjust to them to fit the needs of your program and your participants and your donors.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00112	so just to wrap it up, make sure that you got the main points of our presentation and what we have done and what you could implement. remember to focus on individual and organizational stewardship.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00113	get so creative, as creative as you can. get as many people from your organization involved to come up with ways to steward donors and make them feel as appreciated as possible because we really do appreciate all that they do.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00114	and then focus on stewarding all donors no matter how much money they donate. whether you're canning and they put 25 cents in
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00115	or it's somebody who donated $1,000 or more. make sure that all donors feel appreciated because everything they do makes a big difference for our organizations.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00117	yeah, that is our presentation. if you have any questions at all, please feel free to reach out to us. you can find us at pit underscore pdm on instagram.
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00118	dm us if you have any questions or dm us if you want to see how we're stewarding our donors this year. thank you. thank you.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00002	so why twitter? this is a good question. there are millions of twitter users
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00004	and a lot of times they'll be different from your facebook fan base. so you could be reaching new potential people.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00005	it's kind of an interesting platform because you only have 140 characters to tell your story. so you have to be short, you have to be brief.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00006	it's where a lot of people will come to share their experiences, provide feedback, where they're looking to get customer service.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00007	a lot of times we'll get questions on twitter, like, i'm having trouble with the volunteer department. what can i do? well, i mean, we can give them the email address to our volunteers.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00008	and try to help them as best we can.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00010	how does twitter work? as i mentioned, it's up to 40 characters per tweet. that includes all punctuation and spaces.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00011	and if you want to include a picture in your tweet, that also takes up room.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00012	short and sweet is kind of the end game for twitter.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00014	the messages that you write, which are also known as tweets, are public. you can create a private profile if you want to do that personally.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00015	would definitely not recommend that for an organization. you would want to do something public.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00017	and the other thing that's cool about twitter is it's similar to facebook as in you can do it on your computer, you can be on your phone and check updates.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00018	you can be on your ipad. it's just one of those cool apps that you can check from anything.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00020	these are some of the twitter key terms. i'm not going to read through all of them, but i may reference some of these.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00022	the main thing, retweet the rt, is something that's really important. that might be something that you would be interested in doing, is sharing content from someone else.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00023	so apa could retweet a message from best friends.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00024	maybe we're talking about, maybe it's one of our blog posts that's talking about why it's important to adopt versus
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00025	buying, i'm trying to think what our recent blog posts have been. can't think of any.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00027	but you can share content from another page, which is pretty cool.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00029	and then i mentioned hashtags for facebook. hashtags are very popular on twitter. so wherever you can, try to fit in those hashtags.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00030	on twitter, we try to use hashtag save them all a lot. and we will also monitor that hashtag to see who's using it, to see if there are conversations that we can join.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00031	any questions we can respond to, just kind of keep an eye on, you know, what people are saying about save them all, because that's our motto.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00032	you can also check hashtags like adopt or adopt don't shop.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00033	and just see, you know, what people are talking about, kind of engage with the general conversation, which is always interesting, and you can always jump in and respond to people and engage that way.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00035	and then, as i mentioned, since there are only 140 characters, it's really important to shorten your links.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00036	to make sure that they will fit within a tweet. we use bit.ly at best friends.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00037	it's a free tool, it's very cool, you can also customize your links. we use bitly for facebook as well because it tracks how many people click through.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00039	very useful.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00041	twitter is relatively easy to sign up for. you just fill out a profile and include a picture. generally that's going to be your organization's logo.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00042	they kind of have this new cool layout that they've introduced in the past year. so it's almost like a cover photo. they're trying to make it look more like facebook essentially.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00043	but when we go through it, you can see there's like a cover photo area and then a
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00045	your twitter icon as well.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00047	and tweeting tips thinking it's a spark as far as content and people like links interesting stories that blog posts deals
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00048	you can get away with a little bit more cheekiness on twitter than you can on facebook. it can just be a little funny. that's kind of more of the platform and the people that are on it.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00050	and a cool thing that has been doing really well on twitter is if you actually just
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00051	use twitter.com. we use hootsuite to manage our twitter account. but if you go to twitter.com, you can upload a photo within your tweet
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00052	and it makes your tweet much bigger on the twitter news feed. and it just looks really cool. it's very visual. so if you have a good photo, you can include in a tweet.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00053	definitely do that. the only problem being that a photo will take up characters.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00054	kind of got to be aware of that. so if you're doing a photo and a link, then you're not going to have very many characters to actually
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00056	switch.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00058	so the question is, how valuable is twitter in managing a smaller group of about 1,000 volunteers? and i would say it's not very valuable.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00059	valuable for you. i would say for the organization overall, it's nice to have a twitter presence if you have the time and resources
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00060	to manage it. if you are concerned about time and resources i would definitely say that facebook is number one. it's number one for us. it continues to be number one for
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00061	most animal welfare organizations. instagram is another cool
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00063	cool tool that people are using. and that's something that has grown immensely for us as well. and that takes a little less time than twitter, i would say. for twitter to be,
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00064	valuable and successful for you, there has to be time spent on it.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00065	so time spent finding cool content and sharing it, time spent responding to people, time spent tracking hashtags and seeing what the conversations are.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00066	there's a lot of engagement on twitter and you know there's a lot of engagement on facebook as well and that's something that can help make your page a success but for twitter that's
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00067	that's another one of those things. you definitely can't just talk at people. you talk to people. and that's what the twitter audience expects if you're gonna be present on twitter.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00069	so best practices, relationship building is key. listen for comments about you, respond to comments and queries. you can also do a search.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00070	so not only can you see people who are tweeting directly to you or mentioning you, but you can do a search for your organization.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00071	and see where else you're mentioned, where people might not even realize that you're active on twitter.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00072	you can ask lots of questions on twitter. that's one of those things where if there's like a trending
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00073	like the other day, it was national love your pet day or something like that. so we posted a cute picture of...
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00074	of a dog giving a kiss to one of our caregivers and then just asked, you know, it's national love your pet day with the hashtag. how are you celebrating or show us how you're celebrating.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00075	so, twitter's a great way to kind of build engagement like that where it's just general questions you can ask your audience and get them to respond to you.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00076	engage with you and kind of build your brand that way.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00078	we can also retweet messages you'd like to share, which i mentioned, and i can show you how to do that when we get to the live drive.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00080	and the other thing about twitter is that it's very real time. people will respond quickly and they will expect you to respond quickly.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00081	24 hours or less is kind of our go-to on twitter.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00082	we try to be very quick. we pretty much try to respond to anyone who tweets us within an hour on weekdays during business hours.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00083	you know after hours are one thing and weekends are another thing and we do monitor and respond on weekends as well and
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00084	but there is definitely an expectation that if you are active on twitter, then you should be active and you should be responsive.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00086	okay, the question is, yeah, so the question is, why is an average person on twitter? the answer is because people like to talk about themselves.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00088	yeah, it's narcissism. you know, twitter is a microblog, essentially.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00089	so, gives you 140 characters to say what you ate for breakfast or say that you just worked out. oh, people love to share their workouts.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00091	crossfitters especially like to talk about their workouts.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00092	they like to share photos. again, you know, same thing with instagram. it's just sharing photos. people like to share photos.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00094	what they want about their lives with others, and they want to get feedback, and they want to feel validation, so yeah.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00096	yeah. so the question is, would twitter be a valuable recruiting tool?
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00097	if you're trying to find volunteers. and i would say it definitely could be. if you can take the time to monitor conversations and insert yourself.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00098	in them wherever you can. you know, respond to people that are in your area, talking about working out. you know, if you have a cool program, like the jog-a-dog program here in austin is awesome.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00099	if you have a program like that and you have a presence on twitter and you can reach out to people, you can absolutely use it that way.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00101	people really like
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00102	the activity and the constant feedback. i think that's what people look for on twitter, is that immediate gratification response right there.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00104	yeah, the question is, when we launched our instagram, did we see a decrease on twitter? like, was there any cannibalism? and i would say there isn't. instagram overall has a very young audience.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00106	very young, which is kind of cool because you're reaching new people. and instagram is a place where you can post a little bit.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00108	different content, more behind the scenes, funny photos with funny captions.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00109	it allows for a little bit more creativity just because it's the nature of that channel. and then you can also, again, utilize hashtags on instagram to get your photos seen by more
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00111	no, we didn't see any drop. yeah. yeah, our twitter continues to grow.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00113	and we don't really do advertising on twitter. we've done it a couple times. but i can't think of more than a handful of times that we've
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00115	done actual paid advertising on twitter. here, i'm going to actually pull up the twitter.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00117	this is our best friend's twitter account.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00119	so this is that cover photo that i was talking about. this is the icon.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00121	sprout social has a very cool resource. it's a guideline for social media image sizes. i would highly recommend checking it out. it tells you the sizes needed.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00122	for images on facebook. like the ideal image size to post on facebook is like 1200 by a thousand pixels. sprout social
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00123	and it's a social media image guideline. and if you google it, it'll come up. and it's actually in a google spreadsheet.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00124	so it's constantly updated. but it tells you exactly what image sizes you need, which is really great. it tells you, you know, your facebook cover photo, facebook events,
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00125	facebook timeline, facebook advertising, twitter, instagram. instagram is like 2048 by 2048.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00126	i think. but twitter, the ideal size is longer. it's like 800 by 400 or something.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00127	there are a lot of varying image sizes. and if you can get the ideal image size for whatever you're posting, it's going to
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00129	show off the best, that's definitely.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00131	okay, yeah, absolutely. thank you.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00133	so this is our twitter account.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00135	these are our tweets.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00136	you can on twitter pin to the top of your profile page the same way that you can on your facebook page.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00137	that's a newer feature that they rolled out when they did this kind of new layout. again, you know, twitter trying to be more like facebook
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00139	you can see, so like this tweet here had 20 retweets. that's what these little arrows are. and this favorite here, and 14 favorites.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00141	um,
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00143	this is something that we retweeted.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00145	this is the national love your pet day, and this did really well. it was 129 people favorited it, which for twitter is kind of a lot for us.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00147	and you can see, i showed you this post on our facebook page as well, and the images are completely different sizes. so this is optimized for twitter versus the one that was optimized for facebook.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00149	and as you can see,
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00151	on the feed, it shows up and looks really nice. so this is a lot more likely to catch your eye than just this.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00153	so we try to do that whenever we can.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00155	you can also see who you're following, followers. one thing cool about followers is it shows you verified followers as well and verified
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00156	accounts are normally either organizations or celebrities or brands with a certain amount of followers.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00157	so these are just some of ours. none of these are famous to me. e-online, there we go.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00159	so this is our home.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00161	page for twitter.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00163	so this is the timeline of
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00165	these are all people that we follow right here. so that's what's showing up in our feed.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00167	and as you can see,
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00169	i mean, people are super, super active on twitter. there's a lot to keep up with. you could definitely post a lot more often on twitter than you can on facebook, just because the lifespan of a tweet
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00170	is much, much shorter than the lifespan of a facebook post. so you have a lot more leeway to post.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00171	i mean, we try to get out five to seven tweets a day versus two facebook posts a day.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00172	and that doesn't include the tweets that we have responding to people and monitoring hashtags.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00174	you can set that up. i would not advise setting that up because,
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00176	oh, hello.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00178	see, wonderful live tweeting example. i would not recommend linking your facebook to your twitter because they're such different platforms.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00179	that if you do a facebook post and link it to twitter, it's gonna get cut off, it's gonna be shortened, and people will have to click through to facebook to look at it. you want to post content that is,
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00180	crafted for twitter, crafted for people to be able to see the whole thing at once.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00182	so this is very cool. this shows all the retweets, the people that follow us, mentions.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00184	dealing with trolls.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00186	and able to, yeah. and we can take a look at the hashtag, amp at 2015, and see, look at all these people that are talking about it.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00188	which is very cool.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00190	and so i'm sure you're following the hashtag and then responding to these people. so great way to engage, even though they're not necessarily tagging american pets alive on twitter, they're using the hashtag.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00191	so you can still respond with them and kind of create a conversation and let them know you're paying attention to what they're saying.
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00193	the other thing that's cool about using this, you can do verified users. so again, those are like the more,
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00002	so next up we have dr. wenzong zhao. he leads the harvard me-cfs collaboration with dr. ron tompkins.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00003	he's an associate professor in surgery and bioinformatics at harvard medical school and mgh.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00004	he's a member of the scientific advisory board at omf. he directs the mgh inflammation and metabolism computational center, and he also leads the computational genomics group at stanford.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00005	as well. so he's a very busy man. he's going to talk about the open data sharing platform. thank you very much, wenzong.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00007	thank you everyone for coming. we're a little bit short of time, so i'll try to go through the slides quickly. and we can end by 3.45 to be on schedule.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00009	for the next 10 to 15 minutes, i'm going to talk about what data available on the website of open medicine foundation and what we are doing.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00010	working with collaborators and practically everyone in the research community to look at this data and what has been done and what's in the works and
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00011	so as we have heard quite a few talks this afternoon about the science behind cfs, and we know that as a complex disease,
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00012	there are many potential reasons as causes of me-cfs from genes to infections to the environment. so in order to
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00014	find the potential causes of cfs and perhaps more importantly, find the treatment for patients. we actually have to look
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00015	everywhere for the clues. and as ron and other experts already mentioned, because of the little funding available to me-cfs,
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00016	unfortunately, most of the studies today only can look at one or two aspects of all the things and on a small
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00017	group of patients. therefore, the findings from each individual studies need to be compared so you can find a rigorous signal.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00018	and data collected from different levels, for example, measuring genes versus measuring infections, needs to be integrated
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00019	so we can find something called a chain of evidence that could potentially lead us to the cause of the disease. so we have heard enough of this, and because of this,
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00021	early on open medicine foundation under the leadership of dr. ron davis adopted this policy of open data
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00023	which means that pretty much as soon as a experiment is done, we try to put data on the internet.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00024	and share with researchers in the community, basically all over the world.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00025	and whoever registered on this website can see the raw data and the type of findings that have been studied.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00027	by our own team and often they would tell us what are the findings that we perhaps are missing or they have a different interpretation of the results.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00028	so i think that's very important. because of the time, i would only be able to give you sort of a couple of glimpse of what's on the website.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00030	so this is the sort of the front end of the website. it's mecfs.stanford.edu. at the moment, we'll have another mirror site on the harvard domain soon.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00031	so, as you can see here, each study is separated into different levels based on the type of the study, either the clinical information of the patient.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00032	or the clinical lab tests of the patients, or the different type of molecular measurement, genes, proteins, metabolites, microbiome, et cetera.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00033	so the data are separated into different levels, and then we would compare the patients as a group with the controls. and that results are also available on the website for people to study.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00034	and perhaps more interestingly, we would like to integrate data from different levels together.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00035	so if you have a gene that appears to be abnormal in one patient, you would want to see whether the protein that's called by this gene is also affected.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00036	and whether the function of that protein is indeed impaired in the patient.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00037	so just as an example, obviously this takes a lot of people's work and that's a list of
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00038	people that actually contributed to this website. so this is just one example. oops. here you can see
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00040	that particular patient and this is the particular test that one can choose and that's the particular threshold of filtering.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00041	so you can choose what you want to see, and this shows the results. this happened to be a cytokine data of one particular patient,
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00042	and he or she had two abnormal tests in terms of the patient's cytokine levels. so these are the patient groups, these are the control groups,
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00043	and this triangle indicates the level of the patient. so you can see that this particular patient has much lower
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00044	level of this cytokine, which is called brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which is involved in a number of neurological diseases as a biomarker, actually, for some of those diseases.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00045	so, this patient has been really low level, not only comparing to the controls,
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00046	but also comparing to other patients. so that's potentially value that we want to gather from this type of platform. and similarly, the other one which is cd40l, maureen,
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00047	talked about the functions of t cells, cd40l is one of those cytokines that would affect
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00048	t-cell functions, for example. and here you see that between patient groups and control group, there's actually no difference. however, the level of this particular patient
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00049	for this particular cytokine is much lower. so i hope that while we grow enough number of this kind of observations, people can start to link things together.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00051	and this is just our current attempt of doing so.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00053	so each row here is one phenotype, for example, sleep problems, cognitive test problems, pain, fatigue, et cetera. obviously we measure a lot of those
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00054	and each row here is the correlation of one of the analytes at different levels
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00055	that's significantly correlated with any of these symptoms of patients. so the red-ish color shows positive correlation, for example, cortisol level.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00056	and the bluish color shows negative correlation. and as we heard from the clinicians, early on, since there's a rather large heterogeneity among different patients,
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00057	this is one of the reasons that we want to do this type of analysis to see what are the indicators that would be most correlated with a particular type of symptom of the patients.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00059	yeah, so this is the groups, the physical functions, cognitive functions, and sleep problems.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00061	so, these are our gene results, as ron already mentioned. we try to sequence the whole genome of patients as much as we can.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00062	and one of the benefits of that round, i mentioned one of the findings
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00063	but, yeah, the other way of looking at the data would be that we can actually find those rare pathogenic variants in each patient. realistically, for most of us, we have, you know,
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00064	pathogenic variants one or the other. the question more is that whether those variants contribute or potentially contribute to the disease. so just as an example, here's a,
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00066	cftr, which is cystic fibrosis,
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00068	gene, and you can see that there are two, we call heterozygous variants there, because, you know, obviously this is one of those variants that's common in the caucasian population.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00069	but more importantly, we see actually a lot of these variants that are known to be involved in
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00070	potentially neurological diseases. so because of time, i'll just show you a rough comparison. so what this is, is to ask the question,
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00071	if you look at the pathways of those variants i showed you in the previous slide and ask
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00073	what have been done on these variants in the study of other diseases, for example, in pain, in sleep disturbance, in cognitive impairment, and to our surprise,
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00074	as you can see here, more than 50% of the variants that i showed you are actually known to be involved in all those symptoms.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00075	so, since we only look at a few patients, as ron mentioned, these were severely ill patients in this particular study, we thought that we should...
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00076	you know, test whether it's an accidental findings. we used uk biobank data. there they have somewhere around 2,000, 3,000
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00077	cfs patients, and you can see that if we take their data,
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00079	we would get a weaker but still significant signal there. so this just give you some clue of what we're trying to do.
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00080	and trying to see whether we can use this type of information
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00081	to identify the potential cause of the disease, as well as trying to borrow strengths
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00082	from studies of other diseases that might be useful for treating me cfs patients one day. now, because of the time,
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00084	i'll probably just stop here.
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00002	diolch i chi i gyd. rwy'n mynd i symud ymlaen o'r blaen. mae'n hyfryd iawn gweld chi i gyd y bore yma. fe wnes i ddweud ychydig o ddau gwerth o ddiolch ac i chi.
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00003	rwyf eisiau dechrau gan ddiolch i scandit, sy'n ein cyllidwr ffrindiau.
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00004	oherwydd roedd yn wych gweld ar ddiwedd y diwrnod o ddigon o gynllunio ymlaen â chymdeithas a chymdeithas yn digwydd yn ystod ystod y byd ac yn y lle.
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00005	rwyf hefyd eisiau, ac yn bwysig, dweud wrth i ni ddod i'r diwrnod diwethaf o'r cyfran, diolch eto i'n holl gweithwyr a'n partneriaid a'n arddangoswyr.
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00006	yn enwedig ein gweithiwr platinum, ingenica, ac hefyd ein gweithiwr nid-gymdeithasol.
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00008	hefyd, ar y stag yma, byddwn i hefyd eisiau diolch i'n ffrindiau
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00010	y cwadrant y cwmni av. mae'n ffadliol, rydyn ni'n gweithio gyda nhw am fwy neu ffwrdd o gyfweliadau nawr.
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00011	and whatever else is going on, whatever panic's going on about covid tests and people not coming, you can rely entirely on the fact that the video is going to work, the graphics work and the microphones
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00014	rwy'n rhaid gwneud hynny. rwy'n ddrwg. rwy'n gwybod fy mod i'n gwneud hynny bob blwyddyn, ond rwy'n rhaid gwneud hynny. felly diolch. rwy'n mynd i ddysgu cymaint o munudau i ddweud wrthych am beth fydd yn digwydd heddiw.
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00015	and the first of which is that i'm going to introduce our chair for the day in a few minutes, and that's professor sir terence stevenson, who's chair of the health research authority
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00016	a bydd yn mynd i'n cyfweli ein ffordd drwy'r sesiwn y bore yma. a'r sesiwn y bore yma yn dechrau fel yn fawr fel y diwethaf.
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00017	where we have richard murray, the chief exec of the king's fund, to take us in our helicopter up to 60,000 feet. keith conradi is saying helicopters won't go to 60,000 feet, they'll crash down, but he'll probably tell me that later.
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00018	ac yna rydym yn haeddu i gael ymddiriedwr andrew goddard bodd i ddod a rhoi ei ystyriaeth o'r llinell gyntaf.
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00020	about the nhs and then finally keith conradi in possibly one of his last public appearances as chief investigating officer of the healthcare safety investigation branch or hsib.
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00021	mae'n debyg ei fod yn ddweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym,
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00023	yna rydym yn newid
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00025	i'w ddiffygu. oherwydd ystod ystod hwn, roedd yn ffocws arlunio'r tŷng, ond fel y dywedodd anne pan fyddai hi'n ei chroeso i ni ystod ystod ystod, un o'r pethau y mae gs1 uk wedi'u gwneud dros y ddwy neu tri mlynedd
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00026	yw gwneud o ddibwys ar y bit y du.
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00027	mae yna rhaglenau gwleidyddol yn ystod arfer yn cymru, cymru a'r iwerddon. rydyn ni'n hapus i gael cydweithwyr o cymru a cymru i ddod i mewn heddiw a siarad drwy hynny.
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00028	mae'n dda i'r cyfarwyddwr meddygol yng nghymru, steve bush, ystyried y rheolwyr meddygol yng nghymru. fel y gwelwch, roedd leeds yn un o'r rhai
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00030	forefront and has been at the forefront of the scan for safety program and he's going to talk a little bit about how leeds are moving on from that and what else they're up to. then we're going to have a break.
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00031	ac yna byddem yn dod yn ôl a siarad am ddata. mae'r holl beth hwn, os ydych chi'n sganio pethau, mae sganio yn dda, ond os ydych chi'n cael data,
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00032	mae'r un sgan yn un byd. mae llwyth o sgain yn rhoi sylw i chi. a sut y gallwn ddefnyddio'r sylw i'w ddefnyddio yn adeiladu rhai o'r sgyrsiau a gawson ni y diwrnod diwethaf.
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00033	ac yna, yn ystod ystod hwn, am y bore cyn i'r ddodd, bydd y prif weithredwr a godfrey yn dod a rhoi cyfnod o'r hyn sydd wedi digwydd dros y dydd cyntaf.
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00034	yn ystod y ddau, rydyn ni'n mynd i wneud y camau breicawr. roedd yna gymaint o gynlluniau mawr yn ystod y ddau, felly dyma'r ffigwr mawr, ac yna rydyn ni'n mynd i ddarparu, gweithredu a phrosesu ar y camau hynny.
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00035	ac yma, ar y diwedd hwn, ar ôl bwyd, mae'r sgan am gynaliad a'r dyfodol ar y ddechrau dhl. mae'r sgan cynaliad cenedlaethol yn cynnwys mwy o ddewis a mwy o ddata o gymru a'r sgwtland.
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00037	sustainability on htsa. the nhs talks about sustainability net zero 2040 or 2050.
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00038	mae gennym rhai cyflwyniadau ddiddorol ar y stag honno, ar gyrraedd david lawson, sy'n gweithio ar gyfer guys and tommies.
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00039	and one of the things that we've seen most over the last probably 18 months at gs1 uk is the move to using gs1 standards in a
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00040	very strong way for asset management. and that's absolutely been something that's a covid thing. so we've got it on the scandic stage. we're going to talk about that.
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00042	felly, y peth olaf i mi cyn i terence ddod i fyny.
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00044	yw ato chi am ein diwrnod, ato chi ein bod yn anfon fformau adborth i chi ddod i mewn, ac i bob fform adborth rydyn ni'n ei gael, fel y dywedais y diwrnod diwethaf,
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00045	bydd gs1 uk yn gwneud arian o £5 i'r dec ar gyfer cefnogi llawdriniaeth dynol yng nghymru. ac mae gennym y cod qr hyfryd hwnnw, y gallwch chi ei ddod o'ch llawr a gwneud arian cyhoeddus.
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00046	felly dyna i mi. mwynhau, gofyn cwestiynau, gadewch i ni gael yr adroddiad gweithredu, ymgyrchol, yr adroddiad a gawesom ni'r diwrnod diwethaf eto.
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00047	ac heb ychwanegu, hoffwn i ddod i'r sesiwn yma heno. terence, diolch.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00002	so who here is an addict?
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00004	all right. i love you already. so, um,
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00006	this is a dream. i don't know what else to say. this is amazing. so my mom started her recovery about 30 years ago. she's why i'm here. so you'll hear her a bit as we go through this talk. who's here to relapse prevention?
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00008	who thinks that sounds awful? i just, it's just cold. you know, and so we wanted to bring life to recovery. like, who wants to recover if it's not fun?
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00009	and so that's what we do. we bring this bright light to recovery and that's really what our goal is. so we came up with recovery protection and it's a different approach and i think it gives people the opportunity to enjoy
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00010	preventing a relapse, right? because if it's not fun, are we gonna do it? why didn't we do drugs, right? because they changed the way we thought and we felt.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00011	that's why i did them actually eric clapton was interviewed in 60 minutes and the guy interviewing said so heroin was your first drug and he says no sugar. i was five years old and
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00012	bread and butter with sugar and wafers. and russell brand talks about the chocolate wafers when he was a kid in his book, recovery. this is a drug and we need to treat it like a drug.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00013	so i'm gonna take you through a stackable three-tool system and then we're gonna do some work together. so you'll find cards, stack of cards in the middle of your desk.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00014	if you can't find karen. she's got her hands up. she's got some extras over there. and we're going to be doing something together. so we're going to do some work.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00015	because i think that's the work is what gives us the freedom. so the first thing we're going to talk about is a trigger-free triangle. so we came up with this to help people first identify the foods that are triggers for them, but it actually can go much deeper than that. so we're going to talk about debate.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00016	who's ever had to who's been in an aisle in a grocery store and ever debated?
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00018	come on, where are the hands? there they are, all right. in the room. can you say it again? who's been in an aisle in the grocery store?
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00019	i in your drug food, wondering should i or shouldn't i, right? then we're gonna talk about romance, that longing, that lust, rendezvous. have you ever eaten food and hidden them in the trash?
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00020	or, just, it's like a lustful thing, right? and the guilt that follows the drug, right? how long does the pleasure really last?
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00021	if you're a late stage addict like me, not long. and then you're right into the guilt. so basically,
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00023	what we can do is we can use these things to identify the things that are dangerous for us. so should i eat it? should i not eat it? that deadly question, right? so i hate to break it to you. the answer is no.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00025	you shouldn't eat it, right? and the romance, the planning. i went to nashville like five years ago and every single item on my itinerary was about food.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00026	every place i went was about food because i'm an addict. that's what i do. so it becomes ingrained in how we think and how we live and the guilt.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00027	does it make you feel ashamed? does it make you feel worthless or like a failure? if it does, it's a drug.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00028	so basically, debate is playing with matches, romance is seeing how close you can get to the flames, and guilt is getting burned. who's been burned before?
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00029	it's always going to burn you folks. it's always going to be. we forget though. and we forget. and that's why this is so important to go through.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00030	so just here really quick debate asking yourself should i shouldn't i? romance the planning in advance the rendezvous the
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00032	and guilt, that worthless sense of failure after we've done it. so that's the first tool. that's the trigger-free triangle.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00034	the three ps, and this goes down to my mom. now my grandmother was dying. she was on her deathbed. she was on palliative care.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00036	and i was in high school and my mom's getting ready to go so we can watch her pass.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00038	and she gets a cooler.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00040	couple ice packs, she starts weighing and measuring her vegetables and her meats. i'm like, what are you doing?
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00042	she says, i'm protecting my recovery.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00044	wow, that's what it takes guys. so we need to figure out what is it gonna be for you to protect your recovery. you don't need to protect my recovery, i do. you need to protect your recovery. so it comes with the planning,
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00045	preparing and protecting. we're going to walk through these three things so you really understand the importance of it. okay, if you fail to plan, you are planning to fail.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00046	if you don't do the steps that you need to do to get to where you want to be, you can't get there. it's that simple. you don't go on a road trip without putting gas in your car, do you?
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00047	it's the same thing. you're gonna get an oil change, you're gonna make sure your wipers are clear, right? you're gonna get ready for your trip and you're gonna prepare.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00048	you're going to pack up your car. you're going to put in your suitcase. you're going to remember your toiletries. you're going to do all these things. and that's going to protect your experience on your trip. it's going to make sure that when you get there, you have what you need to do what you want to do.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00049	which is hopefully to have a good time.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00051	so to prepare is to make ready or able to deal with or do something, right? it's the steps that we need to take to make sure that it becomes possible for us to engage in the activities that will ensure that we protect your recovery.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00053	i feel like there's one missing here. oh, so i missed plan. planning is very important. you can't prepare without a plan. it's like, i don't know if you've heard jordan peterson talk about the stupid plan. we've been doing a lot of this stuff in the village that i run, right?
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00054	a stupid plan is you figure out where you want to go, and then you sit for five minutes and you figure out what are the steps that you need to do to get there. you don't need to be right.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00055	you just need to do what you said you're going to do. and then you fail specifically, you'll succeed specifically, and you'll adjust your plan. so the plan isn't set in stone. it's the best idea that you have right now. and then you engage in that plan.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00057	and that goes to the preparation, which we just talked about. sorry, i'm too excited. and then that enables you to protect your recovery. all the things that you've been working on building up until now.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00058	that is the point.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00060	okay, now, so we know about the triangle, we know about the three ps, the three cs are really, it's kind of our take on a sort of a cbt-based
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00061	model, but it's basically what triggers you, what you do, what happens.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00063	because usually as addicts, if you're anything like me, well you had a cue and then you ate your drug.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00064	and then you had a result as a result of eating the drug, which usually stunk, right? it wasn't where you want it to be. so by breaking it down this way, we can see that the cue is a stimulus that sets off the event.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00065	the custom is what you do when you're triggered, right? and the consequences as a result of what happens after you've done the behavior or action or the substance action.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00066	that's your cue. right. so a cue could be anything. believe it or not, i was trained as an artisan bread baker. not so helpful as an addict. but the point is that my wife was in the kitchen and she was like schlepping butter across
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00067	and i work right next to the kitchen. and i'm like, i'm like, i'm triggered. i'm like trying to work. i'm like helping addicts and like here like,
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00068	so it could be a sound, it could be a smell, it could be a time of day, it could be a place, could be a person, could be anything. so we really need to be on guard for this stuff and really take an inventory.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00069	what are our cues right because they have to be personal to us and
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00071	and so we have to be grateful for our triggers.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00073	bottom line, they give us information. bitten talked about that. what does a relapse give you? it gives you information. then you can become responsible to do something based on the information that you have.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00074	right, that's empowering. that's recovery.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00076	accustom, that's the repeated thing that you've done, right? doing the same thing you've always done and then you end up with a, oh jeepus. then you end up with the same results.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00078	that's my alarm to wake my kids up.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00080	believe it or not, there's another one in 15 minutes. we'll get there in a second. so basically, look at this time of day, right? lots of people get tired around 3 p.m.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00081	cheapest, that's right about now, isn't it? so what do we do? well, some of you probably got some coffee or some tea, right? we get a fix. we get something that's gonna change the way we think or feel, right? and then what's the consequence? maybe you feel ashamed.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00083	maybe you're saying to yourself, god, why did i do that again? i knew it was gonna happen and i did it anyway.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00084	so, right, we can change the custom and then we can change the consequence.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00085	so instead of grabbing a fix, why don't you take a walk outside? why don't you get yourself in nature do something different and you'll get something different? okay
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00087	because when you change your custom, you change your consequence. and when you change your consequences, you change your life. and that's what we wanna do, right? you can't live the way you lived before. it's not gonna work. you need to do something different.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00089	all right, so now we're gonna play, right? so we do a lot of this in circle, it's called working alone together. so i want you to go ahead and grab your cards,
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00090	okay, you need to make sure that actually before you do that just grab a blank piece of paper and
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00092	believe it or not as soon as i hit this arrow a timer is gonna start you're only gonna have 60 seconds to do this
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00094	so this is the prompt that you're gonna have for the timed exercise. you're gonna say to yourself, i know my recovery is in trouble when i dot dot dot.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00095	you're just gonna blast off answers as fast as you possibly can. on the blank paper, yes. nothing's right, nothing's wrong,
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00096	it's just your recovery and when you know it's in trouble. so i'm going to wait for this. folks, sit down in case they didn't have it.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00097	then ready five four three two one already got a minute. i'm gonna shut up. oh
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00099	it's not playing.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00101	it's a pdf, i'll just use my timer.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00103	sorry, it's a pdf, so i forgot.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00105	just keep going. don't stop and look at the timer.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00107	we'll give it 20 more seconds. just keep writing until you can't write anymore.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00109	all right, as my client and as my coworker, anna would say, this is good enough for government work, so we're just gonna move on. all right, so you're gonna pull out your cards.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00111	you're gonna make sure that you see in front of you the top card here, not the bottom. so there's two sides, right? should be a one in the bottom right corner of your card.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00113	okay, now what we're gonna do is we're gonna give you 30 seconds. you're just gonna pick a cue from your list. one that you feel you could do something about would be ideal.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00114	and then you're going to write it in the queue line on the first side and on the back side of the card. so all you have to do is pick a queue, write it down on the queue line on both sides of the card.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00116	i'll give you 30 seconds to do that.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00118	if you're done, show me your pen.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00120	all right, we're about half there.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00122	it doesn't have to be pretty to work. that's the good thing, okay? now, think about your cue.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00124	is a debate.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00126	is it guilt or is it romance? maybe it's all three. that's okay, just circle the ones that apply.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00128	if you're not sure, circle debate.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00130	trust your gut too.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00132	sometimes we overthink things. let me rephrase. as addicts, we always overthink things.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00134	so it's the interesting thing about addiction, right? it's really pirating our mind from an instinctive part of our brain.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00135	so we really have to trust our knowing to kind of get past that and start to build the blue dog that bittman was talking about, that's the prefrontal cortex, that's the human brain.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00136	it's a very capable part of our brain, but if you can't reach it, it's useless to you. that's why you can't think your way out of addiction. you have to work your way out of addiction. you have to do stuff.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00137	okay.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00139	now, the custom. so, when you're in your queue,
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00141	what do you normally do?
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00143	what happens, what's your behavior?
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00145	not what the result is, but what is the thing you do following your cue. just write it down.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00147	no wrong answers.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00149	and now.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00151	what's the result of the behavior that you've done, that you've written on your card? where does that take you? what is the consequence?
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00153	kind of dig deep here. it's not just that you drug or that you
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00155	where does that take you? what kind of state are you in? what is your thinking like? what are your feelings like?
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00156	get like visceral and gutsy and because we don't want to go here, right? we don't want to go back there.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00158	pain is the thing that motivates us as addicts sometimes. get into that, it'll teach you something.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00160	all right, now you're gonna flip your card over. all right, now we're gonna play with the three ps a little bit. right, so basically what we're gonna have you do is how will you plan, how will you prepare, and how will you protect
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00161	when you get this trigger or cue.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00163	basically, what you're gonna do about it.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00165	you can always elaborate on your plan too, but the point is that if you have a numbered system that you would implement, you would just do those things in order.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00166	and that's going to take you further away from your trigger, closer to your recovery, right? relapse and recovery happen on a paradigm, right? you have recovery over here and relapse over here.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00167	and you have to work your way away from recovery in order to work your way towards relapse. so by doing these actions, you're working your way from relapse back towards recovery, back to where you want to go.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00169	it's possible for someone to be in a relapse for a very long time before they pick up a drug.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00171	happens more often than you think.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00173	that's why we want to work our way backwards.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00175	all right, so you did your planning, you did your planning, preparing, you did your protecting.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00177	what's the consequence of those three things? where does that get you? how do you feel? which state are you in?
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00179	what are the words that you would use to describe what that feels like?
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00181	this is the reality, folks. your recovery has to solve the problem your addiction creates. it's that simple.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00182	it has to solve all of the problems that your addiction creates and guess what your red dog will morph
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00183	it'll do whatever it has to do to make you miserable not even kill you just make you miserable right. so we need to stay on top of this and that's why this isn't something you do once
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00184	right? i just recently moved. i have two young kids, right? i don't have the triggers i used to have. i have a two-year-old, three-year-old. she doesn't play independently.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00185	like, she doesn't want to. it drives me nuts. like, that's a trigger. that wasn't a trigger when i didn't have a three-year-old. so it's something, it doesn't have to be like so close to the drug. it just can be anything that you feel a little off about.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00186	and by taking an inventory, you really know what your recovery has to be made of. because if you miss one of these things, it could potentially lead to relapse, right?
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00187	right? because you're not protecting your recovery. so it's important to take an inventory. so the other thing i wanted to tell you is that we have a free event. it actually starts on monday. i'm not even going to be there because i'm going to be in an airplane.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00188	basically, it takes you through our system and the final day is pretty much this. it's recovery protection 101. we call it staying stopped.
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00189	so if you have any questions or you're interested, just find me or one of my people at the table over there. they can give you some information. and i wanted to give some time to answer questions. i know there's not a ton of time left. but...
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00190	so, shoot, i guess.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00002	thank you so much. good afternoon, everybody. my name indeed is daniela besana. and as anticipated, i'm part of an international microsoft team
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00003	men hvordan er global black belt?
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00004	who is focused on helping our customers to get the most out of their high performance computing
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00005	workloads by running them on microsoft azure cloud.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00006	today i would like to spend the next 10 minutes together to bring you through some of examples
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00007	we have about how microsoft azure, together with the specific partners, can actually boost in silico medicine.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00008	first of all, i would like to start from the vision,
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00009	that microsoft has about how microsoft can actually help in journeys, customer journeys, and end users journeys related to healthcare and the life science.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00010	and the idea is actually to, let's say, move away from a traditional approach
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00011	where the patient is someone that is brought through already well-defined processes.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00012	and the idea is to move, to embrace a vision
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00013	where the patient can actually be at the center of multiple processes or multiple approaches.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00014	among them, there are, for example, the possibility to develop personalized treatments
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00015	the possibility to enable effective clinical trials
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00016	with the purpose of helping to make new drugs available
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00017	in shorter time frames, reducing costs and unleashing resources for additional research.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00018	and also allow what has become over the last years a typical approach to have multiple research groups collaborating across the globe
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00019	the idea is actually to help those groups to better work and work more effectively together.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00020	so cloud in general may become by definition a new approach in it infrastructure which may definitely help all these approaches.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00021	and microsoft azure cloud in particular, is characterized by multiple features and characteristics and approaches and architectures
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00022	that may even provide more in this framework.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00024	first of all, i would like also to provide you some general examples, not only from a technological perspective, but also from a program perspective.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00025	microsoft, in fact, is involved and is part of the so-called covid-19 hpc consortium,
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00026	which is collecting the major it providers to make computational resources available
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00027	for simulations and anything which may be required to speed up research related to covid-19.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00028	on the other hand, microsoft has also launched a five years program, which is a $60 million program.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00029	and it is a philanthropic program which has basically the purpose to provide computational resources, consultancy, in order to empower
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00030	researchers and organizations to exploit and develop artificial intelligence solutions in the healthcare
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00032	in particular, an approach that microsoft is keen to pursue is to establish significant partnerships.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00033	microsoft is a great technological and solution provider.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00034	but is also very keen to, let's say, get the most out of what is available from the market to provide the best solutions possible.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00035	to enable our partners in order to provide the best solutions to our joint end users.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00036	and for sure, one of the most significant partners we have in this framework
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00037	and that is definitely hosting us for this speech and for this conference is actually katzen medical.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00038	as you know, cadfm medical has developed a platform called docq
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00039	that has basically the purpose to allow simulations and un-sys simulations in
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00040	particular to make them available to be used by doctors and medical staff
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00041	to resolve multiple possible issues in so-called in silico medicine.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00042	docq is a scalable and flexible software platform. that's why it's working very well with microsoft azure,
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00043	because of its scalable and flexible infrastructure and solution that microsoft azure can actually provide.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00044	docq core is the platform and over there, there are multiple modules which may respond to multiple solutions.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00045	here we have chosen to consider a few examples out of the multiple ones that the catfem medical may provide.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00047	one is docu-rp, which has been designed for surgical planning of forced maxillary expansions, for example.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00048	here the platform, docuplatform together with microsoft has allowed to develop or to run up to 100 biomechanical simulations in just 15 minutes.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00049	another platform is docuosa that supports the diagnosis and therapy of obstructive sleep apnea.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00050	also in this case, typical high performance computing fluid dynamics and fsi simulations are used and exploited
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00051	but this time not with the typical idea of using them in typical manufacturing environments, but to leverage them for in silico medicine.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00052	and docuvit is used for virtual implant testing. in this case, scalability is really a plus
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00053	and microsoft azure, because of its infrastructure, is able to support this horizontal scalability, allowing a massive reduction of simulation times.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00054	another example, which is really interesting to me, is related to simulations related to artery drug delivery.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00055	as you can also see here, the idea is actually to better understand how drugs are distributed inside our body based on multiple variables.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00056	in order to be able to minimize drug concentration in healthy tissues and maximize drug concentration in damaged tissues.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00057	so our microsoft cloud can actually help. we have seen with cutfern medical some great examples
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00058	but we could bring multiple examples, again, with caf and medical additional ones and with other partners.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00059	actually, microsoft cloud has decided to make significant investments for high performance computing specific architecture.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00060	so azure, it's not a general purpose cloud that may also do high-performance computing.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00061	but inside microsoft azure cloud, there are some specific architectures and computational resources that have been designed on purpose,
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00062	to provide the best environment for high performance computing workloads. here on the right, you can actually see them
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00063	because high performance computing workloads may have different, may have many characteristics in terms of architecture in common,
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00064	but may be very different one from the other in terms of the computational resources which may be required.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00065	for example, as you know very well, in some cases workloads are very cpu intensive, in other cases they are more gpu intensive and there are multiple other characteristics.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00066	so the idea is really through microsoft azure cloud to provide a very big range of available architecture and computational resources
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00067	so that each hpc workload may actually find the right design, the right architecture,
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00068	and with a greater flexibility, as you can see here, in order to ensure that the resources that are needed may be available exactly when they are needed,
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00069	but only if it's needed. so, we know the idea is really to pay for what is used and to have resources available as soon as possible.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00070	but basically not to design and pay for infrastructures designed for pigs, but that may be available to accommodate the pigs.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00071	also, leveraging azure cloud allows us, first of all, to scale as needed.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00072	so as we were saying, docq is a kind of workload that is actually requiring the capability to scale, but also the possibility to leverage the latest technology.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00073	so every six months, every one year, every three months, some computational resources are subject to technological refresh.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00074	and this is something that in the cloud is made immediately available, while on the contrary, on-premises resources may be normally refreshed in a three-year or five-year time frame.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00075	that said, we are at the end of our 10 minutes. another key piece of information i wanted to share with you
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00076	is that microsoft azure has been also designed and is constantly maintained to allow the largest possible regulatory compliance
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00077	as far as public health and social services and life science and pharmaceuticals are concerned. so with that, i definitely want to thank you so much for your time.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00078	i remind you that in these 10 minutes we have just provided some great examples of collaborations with cafe medical.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00079	but we know that the range of solutions which may be needed for in silico medicine is huge.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00080	and i would be very happy to have opportunities to discuss them and understand how we can support you for other solutions needed that you may have.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00081	with that, if there's any questions and if we have still some time available, i will be very happy to respond. if not, really, thank you.
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00083	thank you very much, daniela bezana.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00002	i hope that we have conveyed the fact that there's quite a few activities
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00003	that are ongoing and are being initiated both in collaboration with the stanford center
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00004	as well as actively pursued within our harvard affiliated hospitals and close collaborators in the organization.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00005	we would hope to use this experience and to expand upon it to create a very special opportunity in the field of me-cfs.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00006	but in order to do that, we do need support from the community, we need participation in our studies.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00007	and i would hope that we would have an opportunity to find individuals who would contribute
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00008	to our support and even expansion of these activities over the upcoming months and years.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00009	so that's a little bit of a shameless plea for finances. and i think linda has a couple of slides here that she wanted to go over.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00010	but we would look forward to having public events going forward in which we can share with the community and professionals in the northeast area our progress.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00011	with respect to the development of the center and all of its collaborations. there is very strong intent and interest among the harvard affiliated hospitals
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00012	as well as our colleagues here in boston. you know, we're
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00014	really
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00016	blessed to have many medical and other academic institutions who have very special facilities
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00017	and i just want to share with you that there is a tremendous opportunity for us to make a massive impact.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00018	on a better understanding, the possibility of biomarkers, and the possibility of identifying new treatments in the field of me-cfs.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00019	and so i hope that as you go away and go home today that you have some comfort that there is a very strong commitment
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00020	and interest. we could easily double the number of scientists and clinicians within the harvard affiliated hospitals, but all of this does take money.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00021	and we would appreciate if, as you go away, to think about how you might be able to help in this endeavor. we are fully committed.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00022	and we hope that you gain some confidence and some comfort in the fact that
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00024	that there is a commitment within the organizations and the institutions.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00026	thank you.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00028	i'm really overwhelmed when i think about the fact that
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00029	we are able to have researchers getting together at stanford and at harvard and at uppsala and really at other places around the world that we're collaborating with. it's australia and with canada and with the uk and
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00030	and a lot of other researchers that aren't here today but that are behind the scenes working on me-cfs with us and with other people
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00031	and we try to bring them all together to talk to each other and we try to fund and only fund open collaborative research.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00032	and it's really overwhelming to think that this has finally happened. it's a dream come true to get all these brilliant people together.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00033	and what we really want you to take home today is the hope that's out there and the hope that we all share that research is really happening in a big way.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00034	and we just need to help scale it up because until nih kicks in more money to be able to help us do this, we need to do this with private funding.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00035	so, let me just first start by thanking the speakers who spoke today, which is wonderful for everything that they're doing. and the speakers that came yesterday, and the researchers and clinicians.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00036	that not only came yesterday to bring their expertise to the table, but had been helping us at the stanford collaborative research center and here at this collaborative research center and now uppsala,
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00037	we have way over 80 to 90 different researchers that are really concentrating on this and wanting to make real inroads into what is happening in the body of patients.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00038	so we can treat and we can cure this illness and really find out what is happening at the molecular level and what is happening so we can find out what the cause is in the body so we can treat it and cure this and put this in the past.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00039	there are so many people in the world that are suffering, and we are really appreciative to the clinicians that are spending their time in treating these patients. and we need to have many, many, many more clinicians
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00040	and we want to be able to fund a center of excellence here at harvard.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00041	and then hopefully at multiple center of excellences around the world so that patients can actually see patients, patients can actually see clinicians that can actually treat and help and support their illness as they're getting through this.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00042	i want to thank the organizers of today and yesterday, ron tompkins and wenzong zhao and andrew alexander and marilyn simon-gerzik and debbie hush did a fabulous job
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00043	and i want to thank the volunteers who helped today from me-cfs-fm organization that helped us with registration and all. we can't do these type of activities without all of your help.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00044	and i wanna thank you for the fabulous job that you had. and i wanna especially thank the patients here and really all over the world that are really sacrificing themselves for this research
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00045	because we couldn't do this research without your samples and without you answering surveys and questions and being bothered and having you spend your energy to help us find answers for many, many more people that are suffering out there.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00046	and i'd also like to specifically thank the donors. some are here today in the audience, and they're all over the world who are listening as well. we could not do any of this research without you because all of it is privately funded.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00047	so i want to thank you all first, and i just want to take a moment to do that. if you can please share with me.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00049	i've mostly said what's already on this slide, but with nih having a $39 billion budget, we hope someday to be able to have more money for me-cfs funding.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00050	and it may take us getting a biomarker for them to really step up their funding. so we've been really trying to find a diagnostic and a biomarker. and also, of course, to find treatments and to push some pilots going and some treatments.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00051	and get this going from private funding at this point.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00052	so, i mean, my goal is to raise $5,200 million and really scale up this research. we have so many researchers that could spend much more time on this if we had more funding.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00053	so we're asking for philanthropists out there, we're asking for people who really wanna make a difference in medical research and in helping people get their lives back all over the world. so i will go anywhere, anytime to meet with people who wanna know what we're doing and why.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00054	and so we ask for your help to help us introduce us to those people.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00055	but i want to thank you all for helping us continue this and helping us scale this up over the last few years that we've been doing this. we've started the foundation in 2012 and we've really started a lot of research in the last few years.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00056	and it's really on a real graph going way high quickly. so we need your help to help scale that up. what we really need to do is set up center of excellence here and like i said everywhere,
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00057	because if we don't have clinicians seeing patients, we don't have research. and if the patients can't see clinicians, they can't be helped.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00058	so one thing we really want to make a real big effort is for medical education and to bring clinicians, number one, to harvard here at a center of excellence to help
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00059	patients be able to have not only services, but also to have a training ground for other clinicians to be able to train them here and then send them out to help patients everywhere, and then to feed all the research that's going to be happening all over the world.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00060	so that's what we call a center of excellence. and this is something that i hear somebody commented on earlier that they tried to do before. we need to do this now.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00061	and as we have here now, time is not our friend, and we really need to find answers now. but i want you to go home from here and understand and believe that people really do care, and people are working on this all over the world,
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00062	and we are all in this together. we all want answers and we all want to help and get patients their lives back. so thank you very much for spending the time with us today. and thank you very much for your input and your help as patients, as donors, as supporters.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00063	and we hope to continue what we're doing and really scale it up and thank you all very much
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00065	we have this in your packet. it's just a postcard of how, if you might wanna get involved. we do wanna encourage people just to tell as many people as you can about me-cfs.
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00066	we really want to increase the awareness and really increase people knowing about it. and so i won't go over these details, but we have this in your packet. thank you very much.
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00002	all of my research has focused on a cow that has just had a baby. so cows have to have a baby once a year in order to make milk.
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00004	but when they have the baby, there's a lot of different challenges and stressors in their environments that make many of them susceptible to disease.
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00005	so my research is really focusing on management practices and the behavior of the cows and how these influence their risk of disease after they have the baby.
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00007	i'm also very interested in designing pens for cows to have babies and to do that i let the cows tell me what they want so i give them an environment for instance that has
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00008	one very open area and one very closed area and let them choose which they prefer to calvin. the research i'm doing at the center involves assessing the emotions of dairy cattle.
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00009	this is kind of a recent area of research. it involves a cognitive bias task to objectively measure the emotions of the animals.
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00010	but this type of study has never been done in cattle before, so i'm very excited about it. it's kind of a complicated experiment, but it basically involves training animals in a task.
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00011	and how they interpret different colored screens enables me to assess their pessimistic or optimistic outlook on life.
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00012	so the experiment i just finished right now was a dehorning trial. so i looked at their baseline emotions before dehorning, and after dehorning i found that during the pain phase they exhibited a more pessimistic
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00013	interpretations of these screens. so my next plan is to use the same trial to look at the emotions of animals housed socially and housed isolated.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00002	okay, good afternoon. we're so excited to be standing here in front of you all today and have the opportunity to speak on a topic that we are all very passionate about. today's presentation will be focusing on all things marketing, branding, and social media.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00003	throughout this presentation, we encourage you to think about the strength in all of our social media platforms and how it all starts with one purpose and one message, one that we all share. to start off, we just wanted to introduce ourselves,
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00004	so i'll go first. my name is isabella voigt and i'm the new marketing manager this year.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00006	i'm oriana mendez and i'm the membership manager.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00008	and i'm zach zelenak, i'm the operations manager.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00010	so i guess we'll get right into it. so today we'll be going over a few different areas that have created strong impacts for our organization and that can be implemented within programs of any size.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00011	today's content includes how we operate, some branding guidelines, social media requests, calendars, engagement, campaigns, member presence, photo style, and resources.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00012	all followed by some key takeaways to better your program's marketing, branding, and social media.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00014	as a large program, we have a marketing team of approximately 70 people. with that in mind, much of what we do can be scaled down for programs with as little as one person managing marketing.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00015	for our organization specifically, marketing is broken down under our marketing manager into three teams, public relations, multimedia, and design and technology. each team has specific responsibilities throughout the year that help support our marketing goals.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00017	every year, our marketing team directors create new branding guidelines that will be used for the rest of the year. branding guidelines serve as the official place for our members to reference when they need clarification on anything specific that encompasses our brand,
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00018	and allows anyone who looks at our brand to recognize that it is dance marathon at the university of florida. in order to provide one cohesive message to our community, we include a vision statement, a mission statement, and an about us section for all of our directors and our organization to use.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00019	we also include color palettes for our campaign feed, as well as our year-long colors. we decide on the different kinds of fonts that we will use on all our graphics, and we include all of our logos that we will use on any supplemental materials as well as on our graphics on social media.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00020	we also include terminology statements so that all of our terms stay consistent and capitalized when necessary.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00021	we would definitely recommend creating a branding guideline of your own amongst your marketing team in order to get everyone on the same page and give other members within your organization something to refer back to when they are creating content.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00022	if you would like for us to send you our branding guideline, we are more than happy to share ours with you so that you have it as a reference.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00024	so here you can see an example of what some of our branding elements look like in action for our current summer campaign feed. you will see that the graphics include all the colors on the color palette.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00026	and all the fonts are the same. you will also notice that our highlight covers match. we always change the colors of these for each campaign to make sure it stands out even more.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00027	even though these details may seem small, they make all the difference and allow our feed to represent a very cohesive message.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00029	throughout the year, there are endless amounts of events and information that we would like to share on our social media platforms. in order to keep this organized and make sure that we are including everything that we can,
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00030	we developed a social media request form where members can fill out a google form and tell us what they would like to be posted. once they fill it out, the marketing teams take all of the information that they give us and decide what our next steps will be moving forward.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00031	all the responses from this form are directly linked to a google sheet, where designers will then go in and claim which ones they want to do, and then from there we will make sure that they are all added to our social media calendar so we can post it on time.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00033	so to explain this process a little bit further, we wanted to give you a scenario that will allow you to better understand how to approach what you are posting and the thought process behind that decision.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00034	an example of a request would be that captain applications are opening on august 30th. every time we get a request, these are just some of the questions that we are asking ourselves in order to come up with the best game plan on how to promote this.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00035	so what platforms did you be using? how early do you need to post? do you need to post reminders? should this be a graphic or a photo? so i really encourage you to start thinking about all of your posts with these same questions in mind.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00036	regardless if it's a large request or a small request, it's still very valuable to get creative and trying to think about really the best solution and debating what is best to important, what is best and most important to share on that specific platform.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00038	as isabella explained, members are able to submit requests for different marketing needs throughout the year.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00040	these are populated into our social media calendar and used to keep track of what needs to be completed and when. this calendar is key to having an organized, cohesive marketing plan throughout the year. on our calendar in particular, we separate each tab by month and color coordinate by different type of posts.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00041	we have also found separating larger campaigns into their own calendars to be extremely effective.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00043	here's an example of what this exactly looks like. on the screen, you will see our social media calendar for transform today, our largest fundraising push of the fall. as you can see, we break down larger campaigns hour by hour to ensure that we are staying on track with what needs to be posted.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00044	this calendar is a collaborative effort between the marketing request form and the marketing teams that were described earlier. even if your program does not have the capacity for different teams, we highly recommend utilizing this proactive calendar structure to alleviate the stress of constantly coming up with content as it is needed.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00046	i'm sure everyone in this room can relate to how hard it is to increase social media engagement. it is something that we are still working on ourselves
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00047	however, we would still like to share some of our best practices for each platform and break down what we think is valuable to post and what is not.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00048	so starting with instagram posts, we have found that we always get the most likes and comments when we post something that includes photos of people.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00049	as far as instagram stories, we really only share updates, reminders, upcoming events, and any extra information that comes up to keep it organized on all of our highlights.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00050	reply posts are usually successful and we will repost some of the responses to make members feel recognized.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00051	facebook is definitely not widely used as often for users in our generation. however, we still use facebook albums as a place to share all of our photos, as well as facebook events to promote upcoming events that members can share to their timelines.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00053	for more fun presents, we use tiktok to showcase the personalities of our members and the fun that they are having at our events. we always try to share these as reels on instagram, even though we don't always share them directly to our feed.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00054	blogs aren't something that every program may want to do.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00055	however, we have a lot of passionate writers on our team that they enjoy writing these. we really only share these on our website and instagram stories for parents and new members that might want to read them.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00056	lastly, we are fairly new to twitter, but we have found that a lot of sponsors and local businesses in our area interact with us still on there, so we always try to update it when we can.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00058	so we execute several campaigns throughout the year, as well as our year long campaign that most of our messaging for the year will revolve around. while these are implemented to strategically help with fundraising, the anticipation and excitement that comes with the announcement of each campaign
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00059	and the hashtag that we release with a video also inspires our members and gets them looking forward to what is to come.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00060	last year, ours was choose change, with the idea that we were willing to adapt to change after the previous two years of covid and a complete shift in the way we ran our events.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00061	this was very powerful. and every year we try to come up with a relevant message that people will relate and connect with.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00063	in order to make these stand out on social media, we try to utilize connective feed as well as the new pinned post feature.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00065	so here are two examples of campaign facebook banners. we update our facebook cover photos for each campaign and encourage all of our members to update their own personal ones as well with the same one we create.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00066	one simple cover photo change leads to more profile clicks and more questions asked about what we do because cover photos always show up on our timeline and feed. we always use hashtags for ours just because it adds that extra push of engagement
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00067	and makes it feel more official. again, these all match the color palette for that time and update often.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00069	connective feed is a really awesome design tactic that we strive to implement for different campaigns. this makes it easy to look at the feed and know immediately where the certain campaign starts and ends.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00070	making the feed connect is not too challenging as long as you plan it out in advance and know what your next 12 posts will be so that you can design accordingly to make it work. the hardest part is coming up with the design itself and making sure that you're posting in the right order.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00071	here you can see our connected feed throughout our season of miracles campaign. you do not have to do this for every campaign, but definitely something worth trying when you can.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00073	member presence is a large part of what makes marketing impactful. our members help support our cause by commenting on our various posts and sharing them throughout the year. to stimulate this interaction, we develop captions that encourage members to engage and tag their friends.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00074	and we facilitate professional headshots to give our members another element of community and organization presence year long. during starting campaigns, we also develop facebook banners as an easy way to boost awareness.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00075	if your organization has teams, we also find that team instagram support recruitment efforts and increase a sense of community. although they are not officially affiliated with our marketing, they are a fun addition that other leadership can facilitate.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00076	for example, our sponsorships team runs the sponsorships instagram.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00078	here you can see an example of the professional headshots i mentioned earlier. colored polos signify your team affiliation. for example, our leadership team boasts a white polo each year, shown on the left, whilst our functional teams get a new color each year.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00079	i was on merchandise last year and we had lime green polos. isabella was on public relations last year and they had light pink polos. the combination of professional headshots and polos elevates our marketing presence year-long.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00081	here again, you can see isabella's headshot. the profile banner seen on isabella's headshot is used for cause-connected campaigns or specific pushes. as ori mentioned, our year-long campaign last year was choose change.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00082	as an element of this, our marketing team developed team-specific banners that gave members the opportunity to share their paired miracle child story on social media.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00083	this is a great opportunity to continue to use marketing to boost awareness for our cause in a new way.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00085	our greatest advice when it comes to photos is to capture moments. our goal has always been to post photos that strike a memory or allow you to envision the emotions that are occurring within it.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00086	candid photos are always best when trying to capture those moments and emotions rather than just post photos. you never know what kind of photo you might need, so we always encourage our photographers to take photos of anyone and everyone.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00087	again, for branding purposes, we put the same preset and logo on our photos every single time so that when we share them, people will know immediately that it is dmeuf.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00089	regardless of how large your program is and the amount of requests you get throughout the year, being organized is an absolute must.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00090	i highly recommend using a platform that is free, such as google drive, for all of your calendars, assignments, forms, photos, graphics, really anything that you can think of to keep it all in one place.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00091	we personally use adobe suite for all of our designs. however, you can use a free platform like canva that will still allow you to create color palettes, logos, fonts, really all the same things that we do in adobe.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00092	any apps that you want to use to plan out your feed ahead of time, i would recommend using preview, unfold, or tezza.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00094	while we have given you a lot of information today, i just want you to remember that we all share the same cause and that there is beauty in the power that we have to share our passion with others.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00095	my greatest recommendation for you all is to make sure that your messaging is always consistent. use your social media to get your members feeling valued and recognized.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00096	get creative to make people want to engage with you and continue to look for ways to grow on each of your active platforms.
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00098	thank you so much for your time today. we really loved getting to speak to you all. please feel free to contact us with the emails listed below if you would like to see any more of our marketing materials. and at this time, we would like to open it up for questions.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00001	so next i will introduce the next speaker, endang wahayu.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00003	miss yvonne.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00004	bye.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00005	for you
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00006	good morning, good day, good afternoon everybody. i'm happy to see you all.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00008	special thanks for ibu safarina for giving me opportunity to share our research activity.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00009	topic given to me is a preliminary research on indonesian cat microbiota related with
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00011	malnutrition and metabolic disorder.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00013	content of my presentation related with the microbiota of indonesian population from infant to elderly based on our group study.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00014	and then some results on gut microbiota of metabolic disorder respondents, particularly for obesity and type 2 diabetes subjects.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00015	and also, i will also focus on a gut microbiota of malnutrition children. however, our sample is very limited.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00016	because we conduct research with a sample from yogyakarta and bali and also lombok. it's very limited compared to indonesia, very, very huge.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00018	before i start to the topic, i would like
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00020	untuk memberikan introduksi tentang grup penelitian kami di universitas gajah mada.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00022	we started research on isolation of lactic acid bacteria from traditional fermented food and other sources since 1991 up to now.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00023	and we got hundreds of isolates which were then stored in ampules at the food and nutrition culture collection.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00025	in early
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00027	year of 2000.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00029	we started screening our isolates with potential as a probiotic candidates. currently, we have several strain probiotic
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00030	we have also conducted human clinical trial on the health benefit of our indigenous probiotic, which involved gut microbiota analysis.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00031	so that's why our gut microbiota study actually starts from the clinical trials of probiotics.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00033	so we are also involved in asian microbiome project led by prof. yuan kunli since 2008 up to now. after two years,
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00034	now our university is stated as a university center for excellency for probiotic studies.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00035	because our consistent research related to probiotics.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00037	so.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00039	this picture mentioning about
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00041	cut microbiota from infant school-age children. this is the result of imp 1 and 3 or 4, i didn't remember.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00042	and also cut microbiota of adult and elderly based on our own study.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00043	we can see here in the picture here,
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00044	yeah.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00045	this is showing the top 30 genera of microbial
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00047	fecal microbiome of baby, yeah, and we can see here start from one month, three months, six months, 12 months, and more than 12 months.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00049	dr. about up to two years, we can see here to me and see of microbiota in fecal baby are.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00051	bifidobacterium and also bacterioides.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00053	and this is very much different if we compare to gut microbiota of the mother.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00054	but after two years, we can see here the profile of microbiota of children resemble to the mother.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00055	so we can see here, we can conclude that indonesian infant have
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00056	bacteroides and bifidobacterium enterotype, while start from school age and then adult and elderly, they have prevotella enterotype.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00057	and according to our research, for elderly who live in yogyakarta and also at bali, they're bifidobacterium.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00059	tend to decrease while the enterobacteriaceae tend to increase.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00061	okay.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00063	here is a picture.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00065	when we get the sample from elderly at the pali in the year of 2016.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00066	we must be patient, interviewing the elderly here, asking about the daily diet and also health condition, including the physical activity.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00067	and we also have to be patient with their feces. sometimes start from early in the morning.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00068	and we compile the faces here and put it in a cold condition.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00070	and then we put in our luggage in this picture, we appreciate to all the researchers who involved, who participate in collecting fecal samples.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00071	we just like tourists with a lot of luggage here. we have to bring from denpasar to our city, yogyakarta. a lot of luggage.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00072	because we bring cold box, including fecal materials inside.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00074	so.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00076	figur ini menunjukkan hubungan antara mikrobiota dan organ lainnya. satu otot di sini.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00077	and also kidney and even lung.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00078	we know well the terms gut microbiota, brain-exist. several important gut microbiota metabolites like here, we see short-syn fatty acid,
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00079	dan peptide, bioaktif peptide, termasuk gaba, bergantung sebagai neurotransmitter.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00081	gut microbiota also support via immune system, which important to support gut health. however, the balance of gut microbiota
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00083	when the balance of gut microbiota is disrupted by several factors such as antibiotic treatment, foodborne pathogen,
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00084	even covid-19 virus, as well as unhealthy life, this biosis occurs.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00086	according to our studies, dysbiosis occur in malnutrition or stunting children, metabolic disorder person like in obesity and diabetic type 2,
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00087	and now we also learn the dysbiosis in nafal-d patients, including gastroenteritis eosinophilic.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00088	saat ini kami mengadakan gat microbiota
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00090	from these two patients.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00092	okay.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00094	some of our publication, it's in our website.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00095	prof. nakayama this morning also already mentioned about the correlation between consumption of
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00096	high carbohydrate here related with the dominancy of romino cocaceae and also bacteroides in the diabetic type two persons.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00098	while consumption of fat cause increasing of robot sia-related problems.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00099	also with profetila, this is a curse in the obesity person, ya.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00101	this is a publication related to the amp project.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00103	so, uh...
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00105	we can see here, this is a report of government in 2021 in indonesia still facing problem.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00106	ini adalah prevalensi stunting, indonesia masih mengalami masalah dengan stunting ini. ada yang bahkan warna itu berwarna hitam.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00107	and in fact,
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00108	we select only two areas.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00110	for studying the microbiota of stunting or undernutrition of children at jogjakarta here in jawa.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00111	and also at lombok. lombok is really red color. in this area, the problem is more serious compared to other places with yellow or green color.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00113	okay, this is study on a gut microbiota of normal and undernutrition
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00115	children with the age of three to five years. the location of the subject is from yogyakarta.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00116	the number of subjects about 28 children. we conducted this research during pandemic.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00117	so it's difficult for us to get more subject for this study. we can see here about the food consumption.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00118	actually, this research conducted in the area with the social and also in economically similar
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00119	so i mean that the income of the parents are similar, but the difference is the diet for their children.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00120	we can see here under nutrition children consume snack and sweet much more compared to the normal children.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00121	and here, it seemed that sweet and snack maybe gave what you call it, yeah, effect to the regular meals.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00122	so that's why maybe children doesn't want to eat the regular meal because they prefer snack and sweet. and according to our data, we can see here.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00124	the differences of this diet give also dysbiosis. we can see here the
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00126	proportion of firmicutes and bacteroides increase. while proteobacteria higher,
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00127	and actinobacteria lower.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00129	and this also affect to the short chain fatty acid between these two group. we can see here the propionic acid and butyric acid it's much lower.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00130	in the malnutrition children, while the ph is higher. here, the ph is higher in the malnutrition children. we can understand during the dysbiosis.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00131	when the many bacteria changing in here, particularly we know that proteobacteria consists of several pathogenic bacteria
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00132	and actinobacteria here, it's like bifidobacterium. the example is bifidobacterium becoming lower. we understand the short chain fatty acid here, it's decreasing.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00133	in the malnutrition children. there are also overexpression of methanoprevibacter, anaerobacter, eubacterium, and also succinic fibrio.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00134	we have published already this last two years.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00135	and the next, we compile. we compile fecal samples from undernutrition with the location at lombok.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00136	lebih sifar berbanding cukcikarta. the aids, cukcikarta, we conduct cut microbiota 3 to 5 year olds in lombok,
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00137	we conduct 9 to 11 years old children. here's some picture
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00138	when we give information about some document that must be filled out,
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00140	in the form of concern, dietary pattern, they must fill in. we help them to fill in the dietary pattern and also the other questionnaire.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00141	and then we give them the cold box, and then the children
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00142	so you have one more minute.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00143	ya, oke terima kasih ya, anak-anak akan membawanya ke rumah mereka dan memberikannya kepada kita pada pagi setelahnya.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00144	okay, the very important, this one we can see the dietary intake is really lower for the under-nutrition children.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00145	dan juga kita bisa lihat di sini, 5 dari 6 film.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00146	also different significantly. and here i can see bifidobacterium, it's very, very lower in...
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00147	under nutrition children while akkermansia is higher. this is very interesting.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00148	we think that akkermansia is becoming dominant because no nutrition for other microorganisms.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00149	akkermansia, akkermansia musinifera, they have musin degrading enzymes.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00150	they have an opportunity to become dominant in this undernutrition group.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00151	okay, and since our research is actually related with probiotics, we have several studies on intervention of local probiotics
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00152	and also their gut microbiota after intervention on overweight adult and also diabetic women, including nafal-d.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00153	and also gastroenteritis patients. some we already published, and then some we still conduct. this research is still going on.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00154	okay, take home message, more fecal samples needed from different tribes and places, including health status of indonesia.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00155	for obtaining real picture of indonesian cut microbiota and their correlation with the health condition. of course, collaboration with all partners is needed.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00156	this is our team and happy to mention about our website here. we conduct a training course on gut microbiota analysis
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00157	and also analysis of gut microbiota, particularly for graduate student. and also we conduct clinical trial for industry related to probiotic and gut microbiota.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00158	okay, thank you. thank you very much.
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00160	like to stop okay
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00161	yeah, thank you.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00002	hi, everyone. my name is lindsay wilson, and i'm the executive director of dance marathon at florida state university.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00003	and i'm super excited to be speaking with you today about how you can look at your data to make data-based decisions during your fundraising pushes.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00005	first, i want to give a quick overview of the topic that we'll be discussing today. the first part of this presentation will outline important data points that you should be looking at during your fundraising pushes.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00007	i'll cover the importance of looking at this data critically and exactly what data points that you can analyze. additionally, i'll be talking about our year-over-year data
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00008	and how you can use this to make database decisions within your program, whether it's during your marathon or whether a fundraising push event, you'll be able to do that.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00009	i'll include some examples of looking at this data and how our program at tma fsu formats our tracking documents to best view this data.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00010	at the end, i also have an example tracking document, and if needed, you can contact me for that as well. the second part of this presentation will be about using that data to make decisions during your fundraising pushes.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00011	how to solve the problems that you're seeing, or even how to approach the positive data that you're looking at.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00012	during this part of the presentation, i'll also cover different ways that you can improve or incentivize your fundraising in the moment, even if it's right in the middle of your main event.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00014	looking at your data can be extremely beneficial for every program, but i also recognize that sometimes it can be extremely overwhelming.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00015	however, if you're able to see this data during your fundraising initiatives, you're able to pinpoint who's excelling and who's falling behind. so that's a huge benefit of looking at your data.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00016	this allows you to be really proactive about solutions and the way that you respond to your data analysis, as long as you're able to pull this data beforehand.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00018	if you do have this data accessible before your fundraising pushes and your process is a little bit more automated, as i'll show you in a little bit,
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00019	you may be able to look at your data to make better decisions on how to target specific areas that you may need to improve in for fundraising or even engagement within your organization.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00020	some important data points that we look at specifically at fsu are our active fundraisers that's broken down by position,
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00021	positional breakdowns in net income, internal teams year over year, our external teams year over year, and our k-12 programs year over year data. i'll go into this a little bit more into detail with some examples on the next slide.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00023	now these screenshots are from our tracking document that we created for our main event last year. these are just some examples of what our documents look like to analyze our data, depending on how we want to look at it.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00024	as you can see, at the top we can input a specific time and our numbers throughout the document will auto adjust to give us an idea of where our numbers were at compared to the last few years.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00026	we're able to quickly see this data and compare it in order to make decisions about areas we may need to target for improvement or areas that we may need to look at and use that to make improvements in other areas.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00027	the first screenshot is our year-over-year active fundraisers. as you can see, our core team, which are our coordinators, showed an increase in engagement compared to the previous years.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00028	what we're able to do here is take this positive aspect of the data and use it to improve other areas that may not be seeing as much success.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00029	during our main event, we went to this core team to see what was working well for them, which we were able to apply to a team like our captains, as you can see, who may have shown a little bit of a decrease in their active fundraisers.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00030	the next screenshot is income percentages that's broken down by position. using this document, we're able to use similar tactics to see what's working well in order to target different areas of fundraising, such as our alumni.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00031	the next screenshot is of our total internal team income. and this can be really helpful as we're able to look at the specific times and that overall income broken down by team to see which team may need a little bit more of a boost
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00032	in fundraising or even in engagement. it leads us to looking at how our organization may respond best to implementing new fundraising strategies in the moment.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00034	if your program is able to look at this data in the moment, you may be able to make quicker, more efficient and successful decisions based on how you believe that your organization will respond because every organization responds differently.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00035	this could be things such as a competition-based fundraising challenge, live updates and transparency with your totals, or even saying that it's your dancers last chance to reach their goal.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00036	the purpose of looking at this data in detail here though, is to not be afraid to make changes while it's happening.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00037	and learning that it's okay to implement a brand new fundraising push in the moment during your marathon, which is how we stumbled across some solutions that we've created, such as fundraising face-offs.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00039	now fundraising face-off began originally as an internal team only tradition,
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00040	on push days where all of our internal teams competed in a bracket style competition. we really have an overwhelmingly positive response to this initiative. so much that we were able to implement this with our organizational teams as well.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00042	it really helped to promote a friendly, competitive atmosphere to encourage that positive fundraising mindset.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00044	the chairs and their delegates within these organizations could also encourage their members to participate, incentivizing it in different ways, depending on how they believe their organization would respond.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00046	and such as encouraging them to hit their team goal or even reaching an incentive that the chair or delegate was going to give them. during our main event, we were able to broadcast this image on our screens to show live progress and updates.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00047	the teams were really able to see their progress live on these screens during our event.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00048	and our organizations responded really well to this competition style fundraising push. so this is one way we were able to see our data, look at it. okay, maybe we need a little bit more improvement.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00049	in the fundraising areas of our teams. so therefore, we were able to implement things such as fundraising face-offs.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00051	so power hour is another way that our program at fsu implements to kind of increase fundraising when it's needed after we're looking at that data. so during power hour, this hour is solely dedicated to fundraising
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00052	however, you can set whatever goal you want, whatever that looks like for your program or what you think may work best.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00053	for example, we use hit your next double zero, which could mean going from $562 to $600 during this hour.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00055	another goal for power hour could be to reach their goal for the push or for the marathon or even hitting that personal or team goal that they'd set throughout the year.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00057	we were able to display our increasing total live during power hour on the screens. they were updated live in event as our mcs hosted the whole hour, including team and fundraiser shout outs to those who hit that next double zero milestone.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00058	this document screenshot on the bottom is from a list of names we pulled from a report that indicated if they hit that next double zero, if they were announced by the mcs, and if they hit it again during that hour.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00059	this live recognition really recognizes them for their hard work. and we were also able to continuously integrate our morale team for encouragement and hype to make this hour super exciting and engaging.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00060	so power hour can be one way to kind of increase that engagement as well as fundraising, bring back that community aspect to fundraising and foster that positive fundraising mindset as well.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00062	this year, we really began to focus more on venmo integration. we really wanted our members to donate directly from venmo to through donor drive in order to discourage them from holding those venmo balances in their personal venmo accounts.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00063	we really highlighted donating directly using this venmo transaction feature in donordrive, which really helped us to also see more realistic numbers in our data when we were looking at that data.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00064	if our money is actually getting put into those donor drive accounts and not just sitting in those venmo accounts.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00065	there are many different ways that we were able to promote the use of this though, and we were able to get creative based on the areas we needed to see a little bit more increase
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00066	one way that we did this was by saying that every 10th venmo donation in the next hour would be matched. to do this, we pulled a report, filtered for venmo donations, and then went through every 10th one to see which one would be matched.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00067	another way that you may be able to promote the use of this feature is by saying that the team with the most venmo transactions in the next hour wins some incentive that you set from your organization.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00069	again, you can do this by pulling a report to see those venmo transactions and looking at it that way.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00071	lastly, you can really promote the use of venmo integration feature by creating a main page for fees and tickets and promoting donating via venmo in that way.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00072	we really targeted this feature when it seems like students may be holding their venmo balances or other tactics weren't showing as much success. and it was something different that our participants really hadn't seen before in marathon this year and ended up seeing a lot of success from it.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00074	next, one of my favorite ways to respond to those areas you may need to prove in after looking at your data is by implementing a final fundraising push within your push or even your main event.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00075	so this last year at our marathon, our fundraising development team kind of created a theme for fundraising for our marathon, which was legos.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00077	so we named our final fundraising push, building our legacy. and really the goal of this push was to hit your overall fundraising goal, whether that was a team or a personal goal, during the very last hour of the event.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00078	this really successfully encouraged our dancers to reach their final dollars before the end of their shift and get all of their fundraising in before the year was over.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00080	this graphic that's on the slides was displayed live on the screens as well, which showed increasing lego blocks as the last hour unfolded.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00081	fundraising initiatives in events such as these final pushes really emphasize how you can truly make decisions in real time by looking at your data.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00082	through all of these initiatives, we were able to incorporate both engagement and fundraising strategies to kind of build and foster that positive fundraising mindset that sometimes you see lacking during those big fundraising pushes or during the marathon event.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00083	so through these things, you're not only able to increase fundraising after looking at the data in areas you may need improvement, but you're also able to engage your members in a new, exciting way.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00084	that kind of builds a more positive mindset around the organization and around the fundraising aspect of what they're doing.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00086	being open to adjusting and being creative during your event will really allow you to make the best decisions for your program.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00087	and to target those areas, you may need to see more success in, or you may want to see more success in with fundraising.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00088	at the end of the day, it's truly all about being ready to make changes, being adaptable, and really giving your participants the opportunity to fundraise creatively and have fun while doing it.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00089	because at the end of the day, all we want to do is foster that positive fundraising mindset and draw that cause connection back to the organization and help our participants realize why they're fundraising and why they're doing this at the end of the day.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00091	thank you so much for listening today. please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions about looking at your data, how to implement these strategies into your program. but at the end of the day, whatever works best for your program works. all programs are different.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00092	but really incorporating those engagement strategies and fundraising strategies in order to build that cost connection trust within your organization.
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00093	and that positive fundraising mindset is really what will help you best respond to your data in the moment when you need it the most. thank you all.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00002	alyssa guzzi, we are here today to talk about work for colleges registration push day i'm alyssa guzzi i'm the campus relations chair.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00004	and i am reagan barrett and i am the hospitality chair.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00006	so a couple of things that we're gonna do a background about warwickburg college.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00007	we are in waverly, iowa, a kind of smaller town. we have about 1,500 students on our campus. our organization was established in 2007, so 2007.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00008	we have 29 kiddos in our organization. so that's just like the different kids that we have with the families. and then our total amount of participants for last year was 374.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00009	and we currently have an award for our miracle maker award. that means that we've been in an organization for between 10 to 14 years, and we got that award. and we're number seven in the nation for the amount we have raised per capita.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00011	so what is registration push day? registration push day is a day that we set at the beginning of the school year. it's our first event and we try to get as many participants sign up during that day.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00013	so some strategies that we use is we're sending out emails to labcen participants at midnight
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00014	so how we do this is we get our list from last year that were in dance marathon and we sent it to them and then for our first years to get them involved.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00015	is they do an involvement fair during orientation week. and if they are interested, they come to our booth and sign up an email to send out to them
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00016	we also, in our email, send out links to them on that too. we do a promo code. usually it's like $5 off that day.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00017	we also can text to 51555 to register. we tried to set goals, think of bigger pictures and break down strategies. we usually do a power hour.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00018	which is usually between 7 to 8 or 8 to 9. and during that hour, we tried to get as many participants sign up during that time. and of course, our exec team continues to recruit throughout the whole day.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00020	so what is the key to our successful registration push day? it's our morale captains. our morale captains are basically the star of the shows. they help run everything.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00021	there's usually a competition between our morale captains.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00022	just to see who can get the most amount of participants. it's usually last year, i think it was a hydro flask and a gift card or just something like that to kind of help them not get motivated, but like a reward for their hard work.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00023	our morale captains also print out qr codes and make sure that they sign them up for their team.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00024	usually that we have like morale captains have like a specific amount of people, a goal for how many people they want on each on their team.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00025	so they do that. they have their own individual promo code. so it's like another of the $5 off.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00026	and then getting them pumped so getting them excited for it and giving them the resources to succeed if you don't have morale captains our closest probably thing would be like having an
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00027	or anybody that's like really close or really involved within dance marathon, it'd be another way just to basically just like give a prize, whoever recruits the most amount of people or something, just to reward them for everything that they have done for the successful day.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00029	so what is the reason to join? well, there's always so many different reasons to join, but some three big ones is a social cause, cause connection, academic or professional resume builder for leadership and experience.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00030	so for me, mine was always a cause connection. in high school, we had a student in my grade that had leukemia, cancer, and we always tried to fundraise.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00031	and i always wanted to continue somehow to fundraise for the university of iowa steed family children's hospital.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00033	does this work? it works? yes, it does. so we started this about in the fall of 2020.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00034	that's kind of when we decided, hey, let's do something different to register and get as many people as we can from warburg to join this organization.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00035	so in 2020, 2021, we recruited 252 participants and we had 340 overall.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00036	and then in 2021 and 2022, we recruited 300 participants on that day and had only 371 total.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00037	so our registration per stay is our first event of the year. so basically, we're not fundraising at all any money or anything for our donor drives. we're just solely trying to figure out a way to get the most people involved.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00038	with our organization on campus. and it is a surprise.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00039	and only the executive team knows, so it's kind of like a spur of the moment. oh, there's this involvement fair, we can sign up there. or, oh, we're just going to have a big party on campus lawn, that kind of stuff.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00041	so how does it help my program? so our fundraising improved tremendously. on children's health day in 2019, we only fundraised $1,700.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00042	and then in children's health day in 2020, we fundraise $6,751.29. we were second in iowa for fundraising, 22nd in the nation for fundraising, and second in our tier.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00043	and then on children's health day in 2021, we fundraised $8,500. and then for the week, we did fundraise $1,500. yeah.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00045	so some other things that we also use are these graphics. so on the left, we have a qr code. we have this posted on our social media a lot
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00046	and also we print them out and have it posted throughout our campus. so it's easier for people to scan it on their phone instead of checking their emails a lot. and then we also do on the right throughout the day, we just want to thank our,
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00048	participants that have signed up so far and we usually send them out an email thank youing them and we also send it out on our social media and post it there.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00050	any other things that we usually do to implement on registration push day?
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00051	is we usually have on-campus lawn, there's a whole, there's games that get played, just a really interactive space for people on campus just to come and see what's going on.
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00052	we usually have like music being played. so it's kind of loud at campus trying to draw attention to people, that type of stuff.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00002	hello, hi everyone. how are you doing? thank you very much for joining this workshop and for organizing this event. it's really exciting to have all of you here.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00003	and so i just wanted to briefly introduce myself.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00004	i am lauren and as martin said, i'm the ceo and co-founder of animal advocacy careers. my background is in client consultancy, so i used to work for a global market research company and i am now in the non-profit world.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00005	so hopefully i can give you all some guidance on how to navigate that situation. so can everyone see my screen? can i just get a thumbs up if you can see the screen?
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00006	wonderful, thank you. i'm going well so far, i'm usually quite bad with this technical stuff. so the goal for this workshop
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00007	is that we will all leave the workshop with at least one new resource, connection, idea or action that we can take away to help you progress your career.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00009	and so the idea of the workshop itself is to discuss how to use your career more effectively and to essentially help more animals through our career.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00010	but in order that we do this, it's actually vital to spend some time actually planning this. and there's two reasons for this. the first one is because not all altruistic actions are equal.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00011	and the secondly is that some time thinking or planning could actually multiply the impact you have by up to 10 to 100 times, which is quite a lot.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00012	so, just move on. okay, here's a summary of what the session will entail.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00013	i will be doing a 20 minute presentation going through different steps of the career decision-making process and outlining available resources, which you can look into in more detail after the presentation.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00014	then we'll do five to ten minutes of introspection. so i want you all to sit there and kind of like just jot down some of your key uncertainties or specific areas that you want to think about.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00015	then i am going to give you some final resources that you can again take away and do some more like planning. then you're going to join a group
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00016	where we're going to all just kind of like discuss and martin is going to very kindly assign you all to different groups with different instructions and then we're going to finish with a q&a session.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00018	okay, so a little bit more about animal advocacy careers. as we said, it was created to help individuals maximize their potential and their positive impact for animals.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00019	i guess there are many ways that we can think about how an individual might contribute to helping animals. one might be that an individual might make a dietary change, like be vegan or vegetarian.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00020	but one of the ways that we are most excited animal advocacy careers that individuals can make a significant impact for animals is through utilizing our career.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00021	it has been estimated through research that most individuals spend approximately 80,000 hours of their time
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00022	and their lives in a career. so it kind of makes sense and a key factor where individuals can make a significant difference to animals would be to utilize their career to help as many animals as possible.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00023	and with such a big opportunity at stake, it's arguably our duty to spend some real time thinking through opportunities and thinking through a concrete strategy of how we can help, how we can help actual individual animals
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00024	um through our careers it might seem a little boring some people might think it's overwhelming and slightly melodramatic but if we actually take through a scenario where we maybe would have two job opportunities i think we can maybe
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00025	talk through this a little bit more. so for example, you might have a job opportunity where it's the first one that comes to you and it would enable you to help 100 animals over the course of five years of your career.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00026	but had you waited for two weeks longer, then you would actually have the chance to help 10 times that amount of animals in the same amount of time.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00027	so as you can see, there can be very significant differences to you being able to make an impact just through a small choice that you would actually make.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00028	and so one of the problems is that there's disparity between opportunities for individual impact. and we also have a limited amount of time.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00029	so it makes sense that we try and think through options and prioritize them all accordingly so that we can assess opportunities when they arrive.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00031	so where do we begin with this? most of this is lifted from an excellent article on etk's and ours website, which i would recommend to everybody.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00032	which is called how to make tough career options. and sorry, how to make tough career decisions. and so this will help us to build a really strong framework for prioritization.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00033	for future opportunities and also plan out our strategy to maximize our impact. so step one is to clarify the decision that we're actually trying to make.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00034	make. so we want to have a clear idea of exactly what it is that we want to achieve through our career strategic planning.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00035	so for, it might be for an individual that you might be choosing between two concrete job opportunities.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00036	some people might be wanting to do long-term career strategy
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00037	but for the sake of this workshop and the widest applicability, we're going to consider coming up with more of our like medium term options.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00039	so if we're taking medium term, then we start to think about what are our most important priorities for this.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00040	so this will obviously be quite individual and it will be very unique to specific individuals on their priorities
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00041	but some of the things that we've written down here would help an individual to really try and maximize their potential through their career.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00042	so the first is impact potential, then we have personal fit, career capital, option value, value of information.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00043	and i'm going to go through each of these in slightly more detail to try and remove the jargon and also to give you all some resources so that you can look them up individually afterwards.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00045	so the first and arguably the most important is actually impact potential. so how much impact potential do you have with each of the job opportunities that you're considering?
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00047	this is perhaps one of the most important parts of it. an excellent guide for this is the center for effective altruism's resources page, which goes through this in a lot more detail.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00048	because a lot of it comes down to cause prioritization. i'm assuming that most of us here are thinking about
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00049	trying to help animals. but then from that you are also restricted by by the specific cause that you're focused on. so it could be that you
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00050	the next particular thing would be that you have to decide between either focusing on companion animals or farmed animals. an excellent resource for that is animal charity evaluators, why farmed animals.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00051	they also have charity reviews and intervention reviews as well. because again, it's not just the fact that you be considering cause prioritization,
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00052	but you also have to think about specifically what kind of role that you might actually be thinking about or considering and how much impact potential that role has as well.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00054	so the next terms that we're going to look at are personal fit, personal satisfaction, career capital, option value, and value of information.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00055	so i've bucketed a lot into this one section, but the reason is because a lot of the resources that are available on this are very similar.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00056	so we've got 80,000 hours career views which go through this in a lot more detail. some of the resources that we have at aac like the skills profiles
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00057	we'll go through and include some tips for things like personal fit. we also have a glossary of terms to go through these in more detail.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00058	but essentially, we just need to think about each one of these factors and how important it actually is. but to remember them all when we're considering career opportunities so that we're able to adequately prioritize between opportunities.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00060	so there's some individual research you can do as well, which is mostly just googling, looking through resources. but another really good way to actually find out some more information is to ask individuals that you might know already,
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00061	so when you have some job opportunities that you might be thinking about, to go through these different metrics and ask individuals
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00062	what they think the career capital opportunities are, the option value or the value of information.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00064	and so we've told us a little bit about like individual potential. so that's like the individual metrics and how each opportunity might help you as an individual to progress your career for animals.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00065	and the next thing that we want to think about is community. so we want to also consider the fact that each one of these job opportunities has significant has the potential to significantly help the community in two ways.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00066	one is to consider our relative fit or our comparative advantage. so how we would compare to somebody else who would also be taking that opportunity.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00067	and the second is community capital. so how do we as an individual contribute to the wider community by the role that we're actually taking?
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00068	and these are quite important aspects and can really shift how much impact one could have from two opportunities that you might be considering.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00069	but it's quite difficult for an individual to actually assess this by themselves. so we at aac have spent a little bit of time this year trying to help individuals really understand that.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00070	through two things that we've done. one is the animal advocacy spot check, and the second is our talent bottleneck survey.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00071	so both of these were conducted to help individuals understand a little bit more about this. there's some various limitations to the spot check, which my co-founder jamie conducted.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00072	one that you need to be aware of is that they are just currently filled rolls and the ones that were currently advertised.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00073	it's also just a snapshot of a specific period of time and we're hoping that in future we'll also be able to retrospectively go back and compare the two.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00074	but some notable points which might be worth considering was that both fundraising and operations roles were overrepresented in the advertised job opportunities compared to the current roles.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00075	this suggests that filling roles is difficult for effective animal advocacy non-profits.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00076	and also provides weak evidence that operations expertise is a bottleneck for effective animal advocacy nonprofits.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00077	the second was that campaign roles and research roles were both slightly underrepresented in job ads.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00078	this matches our impression that these roles are generally popular and oversubscribed. in the job specifications for advertised job roles, communication skills and english language were frequently requested as important.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00079	and remote work was common but flexibility by country of residency was not.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00080	most jobs required experience in related types of roles, so the average role, the average for this was about 1.8 years of experience was required in each one of these job roles.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00082	and so the second thing we did was conduct the, this time last year actually, 12 ceos and hiring professionals from nine of the 10 standouts, charities currently listed on animal charity evaluators page,
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00083	formally or now. and that was asking the organizations like what bottleneck do you most identify at the organizations?
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00084	as you can see, overwhelmingly fundraising and unsurprisingly, funding was the major bottleneck for organizations.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00085	but interestingly enough, 75% of those organizations said that they would prioritize hiring fundraisers in future rather than just having the donations themselves. and that was to enable them to have more of a sustainable cash flow.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00086	so some of these questions matched up quite well, the survey that we did versus the spot check.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00087	and other things were slightly different. so in this, for example, there was quite a lot of mention of people struggling to hire senior managers and leaders.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00088	which interestingly enough was also in the for analytics survey that just recently came out. but it wasn't matched in the spot check. so that's either an issue with our spot check or just like a
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00089	some random variants. but the important thing is that we can try and get an understanding of the key bottlenecks so that when individuals have the option where all else being equal on individual level, the two options are similar,
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00090	that you can have significantly more impact for animals by taking an opportunity where there's a key talent bottleneck in the animal advocacy community.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00091	versus the other one that is where your comparative advantage is minimally low.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00093	and again, these terms are on our website, on our glossary of terms, if that's helpful for people. so you've got those two, which i've just discussed with you. again, i would really encourage people to ask individuals that you might know
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00094	about what they think their key bottlenecks are or to ask people who are in these roles, like if they think that...
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00095	that they're particularly over or under subscribed. but just generally asking more people and encouraging them to give you feedback on your comparative advantage in comparison to other people.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00096	is really good. at the end of this year, we'll also be trying to look into some more research, maybe about quality adjusted staff members and how much incremental
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00097	incremental impact individuals can have but that's not until the end of this year so feel free to reach out to people and talk
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00099	okay, so i've talked quite a lot now, and now my screen has decided to do that, so i'm really sorry about that. so the next part of the presentation is that we want to generate some more options.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00100	so the idea now is that we've gone through step one, which is to clarify our decision. we've gone through step two, which is to think about our key priorities.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00101	and our third step, which is really important, is to generate some options. i know people are usually quite reluctant to do this, and they will usually come up with one or two, but i want to try and encourage everybody to think of as many options as they can.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00102	because it tends to be the situation that we under
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00103	come up with options rather than over come up with options. and then the ones that you first come up with are never the best ones, so you need to keep thinking. i'm going to put up a few options here that people might want to consider.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00104	so you could work for a non-profit, you could work for an animal free-form company, you could work in management and leadership.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00105	lobbying, start a new charity, work in the legal space, marketing or communications. and all of these resources i'm putting up here will maybe...
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00106	try and help and encourage you to think of it, maybe inspire you to think of some more options. and i think that we should all just take a few minutes now to, uh, to think about these, um, options. so i'm going to give you, um,
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00107	two or three minutes maybe, just to think about some more options that each of us could think about to have more impact for animals. and the idea here is just some really rough brainstorming
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00108	thinking about different options and then we will go on to the next stage. i'm going to pause for a second. so everyone think about your options.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00111	i'm also going to put up some tips on the next screen to help you think about your options.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00113	so a little bit of inspiration.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00115	okay, so obviously that wasn't enough time for you all to generate as many options as is plausible for each of you, but hopefully it's given you some inspiration or at least started to make you think about more options that are potential for you.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00116	so after this, the next step that we want to take is ranking these options.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00117	so i'll share these slides on the facebook group afterwards so that you can all like spend some real time thinking about them. but the idea is just to try and get you
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00118	into the space of generating some more options. the next step is to rank your options.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00119	so again, i want you to do just like a really rough initial ranking of your options through just introspection and not try and think too much about it. but the idea would be to take those
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00120	take all the priorities that we discussed in step two and think about the options that we've just generated and rank them against each other so which ones seem like the likely
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00121	highest opportunity just based on intuition, not through doing any research or anything like that, but where we think each one of those options maybe would come through the ranking.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00123	and again, i'm just giving you all of the priorities that we put there and i will just leave them on. and if you can just really quickly look at those options that you've just done and rank them against those different metrics.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00125	okay, so now maybe one of the most particularly important things is to list our key uncertainties.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00126	so the idea is that if you've actually gone through this workshop with me and you've done as i've said, then you can get to the point now where you might have been thinking in the last stages, like,
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00127	what are the things that, what are your reservations? like what are really holding you back from being able to do that initial ranking?
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00128	and from generating those ideas. and these key uncertainties actually are quite significant
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00129	they can change the entire dimension of everything you've just been doing. so you can think about things and think, okay, i've got a really concrete ranking. but what are the types of things, what are the key uncertainties that you have,
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00130	that would actually likely change the initial rankings that you've done. so again, just like trying to think about these things is actually really important. and i am going to pause now for five minutes and let you think
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00131	really concretely about those steps. and then after that, we're going to go into breakout rooms, which martin's going to help me to assign. and just to, we're going to put you in different groups.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00132	depending on where you get assigned, you will have kind of like an assignment for that. but if we can spend five minutes now individually just thinking about all these things, and i will leave some tips on the screen again so that you can have some time to think.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00134	welcome back. so sorry for the mess up, lorin. it was not as easy as i thought. i could not get all the information in the broadcast. so it took me some time to figure it out, but i hope it was delivered.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00135	yeah, well, i hope it was as useful as i got to speak to someone and she was quite fantastic. so i hope that everyone else had a good time.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00136	can i just check that, can you see my screen or not? because i'm not 100% sure at this point.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00137	we can see you, but not your screen. you have
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00138	okay, well, that's...
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00139	that's slightly unhelpful. okay. anyway, i've got it. i think, um, i don't think i have the access anymore to, to share it, but anyway,
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00140	we're just going to move over to the q&a session. and i just wanted to say before we did that,
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00141	that hopefully people have found the workshop really useful and
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00142	or marginally useful and got something out of it. and i just wanted to say that we do have more resources available on our website. and we also have two things that people can do following this.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00143	so one is apply for our one-to-one career advising calls, and that people will fill in an application process, which seems quite arduous and long, but it actually helped
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00144	to try and is actually developed to try and get people to introspect a little bit and to think through their career. and then we can use that as a form for the call as well.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00145	and then the second is that we are going to be doing an introductory course at the end of this, well actually in a couple of months time, and that is just to help people understand a little bit more about the effective animal advocacy
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00146	movement and the opportunities that are available to people and then we will do a more structured and detailed workshop than the one that you had today so you can also apply for that on our
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00147	website and but i think that's pretty much everything from from my side if we want have any questions that we can fire away it's totally fine
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00149	great, thank you, lauren. so now we can open q&a session. we have 12 minutes, or almost 12 minutes. i would like to remind you to not ask the question directly. keep your mic muted.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00150	and post your questions to slido. you should find the link to slido in the chat, and it will be put there again in a few moments.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00151	and we already have two questions there. so let's start with the first question. hi, is it possible to work as an independent researcher within eaa?
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00152	like applying for funding to do research projects as an individual rather than with an organization.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00154	i'm really sorry, could you repeat the question?
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00155	okay, sorry about that. so is it possible to work as an independent researcher within the effective animal advocacy?
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00156	that means applying for funding to do research projects as an individual rather than with an organization.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00158	yeah, i think that that would definitely be a potential option. and i think that there are some funding resources available for individual projects. i think it would, it would really, um,
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00159	specifically depend on what project it was that you were trying to research. but there are definitely some grant-making bodies and organizations that will fund individuals to research.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00160	particularly on priority areas. i think the effect of animal, effect of altruism
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00161	the community does usually fund these things. i've heard of people doing that. i hope that answers the question, but if you have a follow-up, feel free to ask.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00163	okay, next question from haven. what was your career path before launching this new cool organization?
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00164	thanks, even. yeah, so my career path before before this is i worked in the for profit world for almost 10 years before i did this.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00165	and i worked as a client manager and then ended up in consultancy. and when i was doing that, i was also volunteering simultaneously.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00166	for effective animal advocacy organizations like the humane league and the good food institute and i really enjoyed that work that was potentially the most exciting part of my job even though it wasn't my job
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00167	and that inspired me to start charity entrepreneurship, which i think you were also on. then i started this organization.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00169	thank you. the next question is from . who would benefit the most from the individual calls that aac is providing?
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00171	yeah, that's a really good question. i don't think that there's a most, but i think that it would be beneficial to
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00172	anybody who kind of wants to think a little bit more in a structured way about their career,
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00173	the actual application form itself is quite long. sorry about that, but it is there to try and help to get people to really think about their career.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00174	and it would be beneficial, i think, for anybody who is uncertain about any aspect of their career and would just like to speak a little bit more about it.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00175	and we can give you feedback on it and hopefully give you some more tailored and individual resources to help you with your career decision making.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00177	thank you. next question is from matilde daruy. i apologize if i mispronounced that. do you have any pointers on how to go about assessing relative fit?
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00179	oh, assessing relative fit. yeah, i mean, i think that really, i think that one of the most important things to do in assessing your relative fit
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00180	fit is to be quite brutal with yourself and introspect a lot. and you could also ask other individuals. i know some people start those anonymous feedback forms.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00181	and i know both of my friends have actually, if you're the type of person that can take feedback, i don't wanna like advise that anyone to try and get feedback if it's going to affect them negatively in their mental health.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00182	but it can be quite useful to actually ask people that you know to give you feedback so that you can really get a better understanding.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00183	objective view of your specific skill set and then you can quite accurately probably assess your relative fit. another thing that you can do is do some volunteering
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00184	for specific roles that you're considering. and that will give you a pretty good idea of whether you would like or not like those roles. i did volunteer once as a researcher and
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00185	it didn't fit very well with me so i'm really glad i'm very grateful for my co-founder jamie who does the more arduous side of research because i know that that would not have been
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00186	a very good fit for me. and prior to that, i thought i would have been a fantastic researcher. so volunteering can be very helpful for that.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00188	thank you. i would like to remind others that in slido, you can vote for the questions you find most interesting. it is the preferred way of doing this because we have several questions and only seven minutes left.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00189	so we won't be able to go through all of them. the next question is, if you want to work in a plant-based campaigning on institutional level,
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00190	what kind of university degree would be useful or what skills would be useful to learn?
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00192	yeah, that's a really good question and very specific. i don't think that i would be the best person to ask that for because i don't have that background. so for me to kind of like answer that question would probably be misdirected.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00193	i think that if you were to use the community directory, which i think i referenced before, there will probably be somebody who actually specifically worked in that space.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00194	and can probably tell you about their career trajectory and how they got there and which ones are more useful than other ones.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00196	if that's okay as an answer.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00198	janis rekis, phd, okay, thank you. let's get to the next one. do you have any tips for how to cheaply explore social scientific research related to effective animal advocacy and alternative protein startups.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00200	again, that's a very specific question. i don't really have an answer for that. i'm really sorry. but i think the general thing would be that if you have a really, really specific question about a particular career,
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00201	role, i would really encourage you to reach out to somebody who has got a background in that because they will have the best advice. and unfortunately, as a new organization, we've only been going for like a year.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00202	we have only researched into a specific area at the moment and overall career strategy and very specific questions would probably be better directed
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00203	to somebody who has significantly more experience in a specific role.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00205	janis rekis, keloland how lengthy is the process involved in applying for individual career counseling calls?
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00207	sorry, could you just repeat that?
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00208	how lengthy is the process involved in applying for individual career counseling goals?
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00209	yeah, so it's a 50-50% chance that you will get onto the career advising call. the reason is so that we can accurately assess whether it's actually been useful for people to have career advising.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00210	this year. so you it's not based on the actual application itself. it doesn't matter if it's a good or bad. there is no good or bad in the application. it's literally random chance.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00211	the first person will get either assigned to jamie or myself for a career advising call
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00212	and the second person will be assigned to a control trial. it's not like an application where you can get a good or a bad result.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00214	okay, next question.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00216	do the individual calls assume that applicants have decided to prioritize animal advocacy as a cause area, or can you talk about prioritization in the calls? no, you can definitely talk about prioritization.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00217	the idea of our career advising calls is to help people to maximize their impact in general. obviously, it's nice if it's for animals and we'd like to discuss those options with people, but i don't think that...
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00218	if you haven't decided 100% on animal advocacy, i think that it would still be very interesting to have that dialogue. and you can use the same type of framework usually,
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00219	for assessing all different types of options. they don't have to be specific to animal advocacy.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00221	thank you. next question is from jonathan. how is the career goals experiment going? when do you expect to have an idea on how effective the coaching is and whether you will continue with it?
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00222	it's a very good question, jonathan. it's going really, it's going well at the moment, i think.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00223	i mean, again, this is one of those things that i'm sure, as you know, by posing that question, it's very difficult to get results back straight away.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00224	at the moment we've had quite a lot of positive feedback, but what we're actually going to be doing is assessing incremental changes that people might have made.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00225	based on the calls. it's likely that we will get initial results after about six months after the calls.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00226	but likely, if you look at 80,000 hours and you've seen their work, they have advised us that it'll probably be two to three years before we'll really significantly understand.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00227	whether we've had any impact or not, which is why it's only one of the few things that we're experimenting in this year.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00229	thank you.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00231	next question is from andrea. how should we find a job in animal rights research if there aren't so many open vacancies?
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00233	really good question. i think, as i said, when we were actually doing our spot check and research,
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00234	it does seem that some roles are a lot more competitive than other ones. research is definitely one of them.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00235	and campaigning is another. so in that situation, there's just a lot of people and there's not enough roles.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00236	and what i would suggest would be to work on the generating options idea, because it could be that if long term you want to do research,
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00237	and that could, that's definitely still a plausible path, but it might just be that at the moment, initially, there aren't the research roles available. and so i would really encourage you to look into other options that you have more immediately,
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00238	if your long term is thinking about having a career in research to look for more immediate options that can help you get towards that goal
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00239	and at the end, and not to focus too much on not getting specific opportunities right now.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00241	thank you. and we have time for one last question. and we have only one last question in slido. so this is unfortunate. the last question is, what do you envision animal advocacy careers are doing in five years?
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00243	that's a really good question. that's a really, really good question. and the easy answer to that would be doing the most impactful thing that we can to help individuals maximize their impact for animals.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00244	the slightly harder question answer would be that i really don't know. that's why we're testing different things.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00245	as much as possible and experimenting on a small scale. and so we can try and work out how we can help individuals
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00246	so as much feedback would be gratefully accepted, whether it's positive or negative, we really appreciate that because it helps us to be more effective in the long term.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00248	okay, thank you very much, lauren. we are out of questions and out of time. i think for the rest of us, it's time to unmute ourselves and give lauren a short round of applause.
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00250	aw, thank you. that's really nice. i wasn't expecting that.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00002	welcome to the cadfa medical conference 2021 from me. i'm jan hertwig, the ceo of cadfa medical, and i'm very happy that so much participants joined here today.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00003	and i would like to thank all the participants and speakers that have joined.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00004	so we're now looking forward to a very exciting afternoon with great presentations on computational modeling in medicine and medical technology and in silico methods in the healthcare industry. please enjoy.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00006	for the opening of the cadfa medical conference 2021, i will invite you to a short look on what we do and achieved with our partners at cadfa medical.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00007	so at catfirm medical, our vision is to be the number one enabler for in silico medicine. we want to provide physicians and patients access to in silico methods.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00008	so with our mission to transfer simulation technologies from automotive and aerospace to healthcare, we want to enhance the well-being of patients.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00009	so to do so, we deeply believe in the use of numerical simulation to detect diseases, improve therapies, and enhance the product safety of medical devices.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00010	all of our products has their roots in research projects and with academia and universities.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00011	so for example, docurpe for the surgical planning of first maxilla expansions developed together with klinikum dortmund, kailas martin and the university of wittenherdeke.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00012	and also dochio for the diagnosis and therapy of obstructive sleep apnea. it's also a universal and grant funded research project.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00013	and docuvit for the digital verification of custom implants also. so all our products are based on research and universal research to test and to really verify our models and our ideas.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00015	and to bring these innovations from academia and research to industrial applications, we developed docu. so our scalable in silico platform enabling doctors and medtech use ansys simulation technologies in predefined medical workflows.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00016	so every specific medical question is always transferred into a so-called docu module. so the blue cube you can see in the middle,
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00017	and each module is a product with a specific intended use, which then can operate autonomously together with the platform docucore in green.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00018	so through our partnership with microsoft, we are delivering a very scalable infrastructure, enabling unrestricted and easy to use access to our products and ansys solvers in verified infrastructures on azure.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00019	and to give a better idea of how we use numerical simulation to add value, i will show you some examples and benefits of the modules based on our darkq platform.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00021	first of all, docuosa to support the diagnosis and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea and sleep related breathing disorders.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00022	so it supports the diagnosis and therapy with computational fluid dynamics and fluid structure interaction.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00023	with docuosa, it is possible for a physician to visualize the characteristics of an upper airway and determine the anatomical and biomechanical causes and the area of the respiratory problem for a patient.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00024	really objectifying the root causes and improve the communication of the treatment options to the patient and
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00025	and currently we are in a patient study with over 60 patients together with our clinical partner, clinic in dortmund, and we're aiming for a ce mark in early 2023.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00027	the next example is docurpe. it's a software for surgical planning of so-called forced maxillary distractions. so it calculates the optimal cutting patterns, ensuring
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00028	symmetrical phase after and during the forced widening of the upper jaw. so the problem with this procedure is very simple. so nearly everyone has a symmetrical or asymmetrical anatomy.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00029	so meaning different bone thicknesses in the skull. for the forced opening of the upper jaw, a so-called distractor is positioned in the upper jaw and applies a symmetrical force onto the bone parts.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00030	and symmetric bone weakening cuts will be introduced in the maxilla normally, and left and right with the same length. so this can result in an asymmetric opening of the maxilla, meaning one side of the upper jaw moves more than the opposite side.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00031	so with docurpe, kalis martin can calculate the optimal cutting patterns and generate a cutting guide for the surgeon. so they can rely on consistent quality of patient care and the best surgical outcomes.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00033	and the really nice thing on top of the reduction of the trauma for the patient through shorter cuts and remaining blood vessels, the symmetric outcome and the better esthetics for the patient.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00034	is there is a possibility to individualize an off-the-shelf medical device.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00035	so, kls marketing can give an added value by selling a hybrid product, a standardized hardware product plus a personalized digital planning with simulation.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00037	and with the third example coming from academia,
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00038	docuvit, vit stands for virtual implant testing. we want to help and make medical devices safer.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00039	so we saw a big trend in personalization of medical devices. and if medical devices are personalized, they are unique and produced just once. so that means they cannot be tested like standard medical devices.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00040	so in the production process of these custom implants,
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00041	usually, they acquire patient data, do surgical planning together with a doctor via web meeting, do an implant design by a designer or in a poc, so a point of care center and a clinic,
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00042	and then do the implant manufacturing with milling, 3d printing, etc., and the post-processing steps.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00043	and sending it to surgery. normally, that happens within two to eight days from data acquisition to sending the results.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00044	and there is already a lot of quality management necessary in the manufacturing and the post-processing, and a lot of quality management that has to get into technical documentation.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00045	but where it's really important and where safety and efficacy of a device for a patient is determined, it's in the surgical planning and implant design. but there's no possibility to test your devices for each patient.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00046	and their docivit comes in so we developed to fill the scap docivit and digital design verification and an automated reporting of the results for the technical documentation
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00048	so in a nutshell, docuvit is an easy to use software for digital verification of custom end plans.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00049	and we can apply physiological and standardized loads to patient-specific situations and patient-specific implants and reduce the liability based on objective criteria.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00050	and ensure the safety and efficacy with highly complex biomechanical simulations. so at the moment, workflows are available for the maxilla, the mandible, the thorax, and soon for the lower arms.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00052	and what that made happen is really research and a lot of effort in our platform.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00053	and to sum it up with our platform, docu, we want to really provide an ecosystem for in silico technologies and for academia and other companies. so we do not.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00055	or we want the companies and academia do not reinvent the wheel.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00056	because docu is providing already a scalability, a working infrastructure, the regulatory framework, the base technologies such as ansys solvers, 3d rendering, dicom and data handling, user management, etc.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00057	and we know that there are great ideas and solutions being developed in research and industry. and together we can further develop them and make them available for patients and doctors.
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00059	so thank you for your attention and a big thank you to our partners, speakers and panelists today. and feel free to contact us and please enjoy the afternoon. thank you very much.
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00001	i welcome you to this presentation entitled citizen attitudes towards genome editing in farm animals.
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00003	we asked around 3,700 citizens from austria, canada, germany, italy and the us on this topic and we collected our data online between may and november 2019.
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00004	our first research question is, are different applications of genome editing right or wrong to do from a citizen's perspective?
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00005	we included five different applications of genome editing in the study. three of them refer to disease resistance within different species.
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00006	namely hiv resistance in humans, mildew resistance in wheat plants, and resistance to prrs in pigs.
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00007	the other two applications refer to editing cattle to produce allergen-free milk and to increase muscle growth in cattle.
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00009	each study participant was randomly assigned to one of the five applications and read a short introductory text about genome editing and the specific application.
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00011	this figure shows how participants responded to the question whether they think it is right or wrong to use genome editing for the application they just read about.
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00012	answers could be given on a 7-point likert scale ranging from 1 absolutely wrong to do up to 7 absolutely right to do.
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00014	the application being the most right to do is the hiv resistance in humans followed by mildew resistance in wheat plants.
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00015	the three applications dealing with editing farm animals are perceived as being less right, in the order of resistance in pigs towards purse, editing cattle to produce allergen-free milk,
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00016	and the increased muscle growth in cattle is perceived as wrong on average.
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00017	the order of applications is the same in all countries, whereas we observe the german and austrian participants being a bit more skeptical compared to the other countries.
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00019	our second research question was whether we can find different groups of participants according to their attitudes towards genome editing.
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00021	indeed, we were able to find four different groups of participants. the strong supporters here in dark green think that genome editing is right to do. they perceive little risks
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00022	high benefits and do not think that the technology is tampering with nature. the opponents in red think that genome editing is really wrong to do. they perceive high risks,
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00023	low benefits and think that it's tampering with nature. the other two clusters are in between these two groups.
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00025	the results of the cluster analysis show that there are quite diverse groups of people with regard to their attitudes to genome editing.
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00027	thank you very much for listening and i'm looking forward to your questions and comments and please feel free to contact me for this.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00002	hi, my name is coleman stavish, and i'm the chief technology officer at procia, a software company in the field of cancer research and diagnostics.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00003	today, i'll be talking about how aws, procia, and the joint pathology center have joined forces to advance the practice of pathology.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00005	in today's session, i'll introduce procia and share how our concentric platform helps to address fundamental challenges in the pathology industry. we'll also look at the joint pathology center and its trailblazing initiative in digital transformation.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00006	and throughout the session, i'll touch on how partnership with aws makes all of this possible.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00008	proch's mission is to perfect cancer diagnosis with intelligent software that changes the way the world practices pathology.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00010	we built a software platform that supports pathology's transition from analog to digital, which can accelerate discovery in life sciences research and improve clinical outcomes.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00012	prosure was founded in 2014 and is backed by a strong group of venture capital and strategic investors. today, prosure's platform is trusted by leading biopharma companies, contract research organizations, hospital systems, and academic medical centers.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00014	let's take a step back briefly and look at pathology as a field.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00016	this is an image of a pathologist desk.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00018	hundreds of glass slides in trays awaiting review under a microscope and antiquated technology. this field of medicine hasn't fundamentally changed in over a century and is in dire need of a transformation.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00020	further, the practice of pathology is inherently subjective.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00022	pathologist concordance can be as low as 54%, which means in some sensitive areas of diagnosis and prognosis, two pathologists may disagree with each other about half the time.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00023	what that means practically is that a patient could be undertreated or over-treated based on that diagnosis, leading to potentially poor outcomes for the patient and increased costs of the healthcare system.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00024	at the same time, pathologists and the labs they work for are under intense economic pressure. globally, labs do not have enough staff to meet increasing demand. with the global pathologist workforce shrinking,
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00025	and the pathologist workload exploding over the past decade. as a quick checkpoint, it's sometimes useful to compare pathology to radiology, which underwent its own digital transformation two decades ago or so.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00026	while there are some parallels between the two specialties, pathology images are on average 10 times larger, averaging two gigabytes per image, sometimes as large as 30 gigabytes or more.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00027	of course, this presents a considerable challenge from an it standpoint, ensuring that storage and compute infrastructure can scale to support what's on track to become one of the most data-intensive fields of medicine.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00028	aws and its broad solution portfolio has been an excellent partner to procea and many customers practicing digital pathology at scale.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00029	powering pathology shift to digital are three technology pillars. first, slides are digitized using whole slide scanners, which take a glass slide and produce a digital image for pathology review,
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00030	and those images are managed in an image management system.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00032	and after an image is created, it can be analyzed by one or more computational applications or algorithms intended to aid the pathologist or scientists.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00034	procia builds the image management system concentric and also has a portfolio of add-on applications.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00036	proch's concentric platform lives at the center of the pathology ecosystem.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00038	concentric runs natively on aws to manage all pathology data in the cloud for high scalability while keeping costs under control.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00040	concentric integrates with third-party solutions to deliver a best-in-class experience for digital pathology, pulling images in from any slide scanner and patient data from the laboratory information system.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00042	concentric provides pathologists with their portal for reading images and rendering diagnoses and enables instant remote consultation with experts around the world.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00044	concentric is designed to use aws offerings such as s3 object storage with intelligent tiering,
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00046	rds and ec2 instances with auto scaling to support the high and sometimes variable demands of digital pathology.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00048	now, i'd like to shift gears and introduce the joint pathology center, which is the pathology center of excellence for the united states military and other federal entities.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00050	the jpc's mission is twofold. first, to deliver the highest quality pathology consultation and education,
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00051	and second, to grow and preserve the world's largest tissue biorepository for biomedical research. as the steward of the world's largest human tissue bank,
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00052	containing over 55 million glass slides dating back over a century. the jpc has embarked on an incredibly exciting digital transformation to digitize its vast slide archive to promote novel research.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00054	and to streamline its pathology practice for consultation.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00056	at procia, we're honored to deliver our concentric platform to the jpc to support their effort. and aws govcloud was also selected to support this project due to its strong compliance measures, scalability, and ease of deployment.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00058	as an aside, the joint pathology center's groundbreaking project was recently featured on 60 minutes. the segment highlighted the tremendous value in being able to search a vast and diverse archive of disease to combat pandemics and other public health crises.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00060	i'd encourage anyone to look up the segment if interested. as i've mentioned previously, it infrastructure is a crucial piece to the digitization of pathology. aws cloud provides customers an efficient solution right out of the box.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00061	first, offering security for sensitive health care and biopharma information. regulatory compliance, scalable infrastructure for fast-growing and high-volume datasets,
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00062	enabling collaboration for more efficient remote work, which is of course become increasingly important over the past year. and finally, cost effectiveness, making adoption easier initially and enabling future expansion.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00064	in summary, best-in-class software coupled with flexible, scalable, and secure it infrastructure are required to build the future of pathology. procia and aws are proud to partner to deliver solutions that help our customers realize this vision.
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00066	thank you for listening.
YTB+npZWztwSMAk+00001	so dr. vardachari is going to talk about
YTB+npZWztwSMAk+00003	how she has, with her committee, she has managed to provide
YTB+npZWztwSMAk+00004	a source of, continuous source of physicians to the hospitals in india that are doing these free charitable works, the sathya sai hospitals.
YTB+npZWztwSMAk+00006	i love you all. thank you all for being here.
YTB+npZWztwSMAk+00007	i want to thank dr. narendra nathredi for giving me the privilege to present this topic of ssio doctors participation in sathya sai hospitals.
YTB+npZWztwSMAk+00008	since hunger pains have started, i will deliver soon, so don't worry.
YTB+npZWztwSMAk+00010	okay, next slide.
YTB+npZWztwSMAk+00012	next slide please, samanta. i have no conflict of interest to disclose, next.
YTB+npZWztwSMAk+00014	no, can someone?
YTB+npZWztwSMAk+00015	sure.
YTB+npZWztwSMAk+00016	okay, this slide gives an overview of the activities of the ssi or doctors in sathya sai medical institutes in india.
YTB+npZWztwSMAk+00017	number one, the doctors volunteer their services in sathisai general hospital and sathisai institute of higher medical sciences in puttaparthi and in whitefield, bangalore.
YTB+npZWztwSMAk+00019	number two, the physicians participate in the medical service activities organized by the sathya sai international organization as medical camps twice a year during guru poornima

YTB+npZWztwSMAk+00079	love all, serve all. thank you.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00001	ascertain that the patient is the right candidate for the procedure. then the next step is the radiological planning which will be discussed in this video. one should know exactly how much is the varus or valgus deformity, whether the deformity is in the tibia or femur or both.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00002	how much correction should be undertaken? are you going to correct in the tibia or femur or in both? the steps in radiological planning for high tibial osteotomy are, obtaining proper x-rays and analyzing them, radiological planning.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00003	intra-operative verification and finally obtaining a good result. a standing full-length x-ray, with the patient bearing weight on both the limbs is very crucial for planning for osteotomy.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00004	the x-ray source is positioned 10 feet away from the patient and a long cassette can be used. or a cassette deck as shown in the image with an image processing software can also be used.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00005	the x-ray beam is centered on the knee and the exposure would be around 85 to 105 kilovolts. the x-ray image will always be downsized and to know the original measurements placement of a object with a known size is important.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00006	a metallic sphere is preferable as it casts a round shadow always. here a metallic ball of 3 cm, which is embedded in a cloth velcro belt is tied around the lower third of thigh, in level with the bone in the sagittal section.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00007	the patient's patella should be facing forward and the anterior superior iliac spine should be at the same level. any limb length discrepancy noted should be addressed by keeping planks under the shorter leg.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00008	a properly exposed scanogram should be examined for the central position of patella. the lateral tibial margin should cross the fibula at the widest part of fibula. there should be a one-third overlap of fibula by tibia.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00009	the distal femur and joint line should be clearly visible without any overlap. in planning we are concerned primarily with mechanical axis. anatomical axis of a long bone is a line that divides the shaft into two halves.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00010	the mechanical axis of the femur connects the center of the femoral head and the center of the intercondylar notch. in the tibia it is a line connecting the center of the tibial articular surface with the center of the ankle joint.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00011	in femur the anatomical and mechanical axes are different with a 6 to 7 degrees variation. in tibia both are almost same with the anatomical axis being 3 to 4 hmm medial to the mechanical axis.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00012	the mechanical axis of the entire lower limb, also called the mcculloch's line runs from the center of the femoral head to the center of the ankle joint. under physiological conditions this line runs on an average of 4 hmm medial to the center of the knee joint.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00013	when this line is displaced more than 10 hmm laterally or more than 15 hmm medially, then it is called a significant mechanical axis deviation.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00014	in this video we will consider the varus deformity primarily. varus deformity could be produced by deformities in tibia or femur, erosion of medial joint, laxity of lateral ligament structures and following malunited and trarticular fractures.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00015	the mechanical axis deviation would indicate a significant varus, but to understand the origin of the varus,
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00016	it is important to know and calculate these two measurements. medial proximal tibial angle, shortened as mpta and lateral distal femoral angle, shortened as ldfa.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00017	the mpta is the angle formed by the mechanical axis of the tibia with the tangential line to the tibial articular surface. its normal value is 87° with a deviation of 3°.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00018	any decrease in the value indicates that the origin of varus is from the tibia. the ldfa
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00019	is the angle formed by the mechanical axis of the femur with the tangential line to the distal femoral articular surface and once again it has the same value of 87 degrees. any increase in this value indicates that the origin of varus is from the femur.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00020	once the tibia is confirmed as the source of varus, the cause of the varus should be ascertained. it could be a medial joint erosion, it could be a metaphysial deformity.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00021	loose lateral structures due to a previous ligament injury or stretching can cause lateral joint opening, aggravating the varus. very rarely the varus can be contributed by a diaphysial deformity.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00022	in many cases, the metaphysial varus can be measured by calculating the tibial bone varus angle.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00023	it is the angle formed between the epiphyseal axis, the line that is perpendicular to the line that connects the medial and lateral ends of the epiphyseal scar line and the mechanical axis of tibia. a tibia more than 5 degrees indicates a metaphysial varus.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00024	hto gives the best results if done for a metaphysial deformity as it corrects the deformity and restores normal morphology. it gives the best outcomes.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00025	on the other hand an hto and a normal proximal tibial morphology can induce a new deformity even though unloading is achieved. it is important to understand the varus produced by lateral joint opening due to excess laxity of the lateral ligament structures.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00026	one should not correct this component of varus and bone. the joint line convergence angle is the angle between the tangentials to the distal femoral and distal tibial articular surfaces. up to 2 degrees is normal.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00027	any value more than that should be subtracted from the overall varus correction. fujisawa point is a popular landmark for shifting the weight-bearing line, which was inferred from a retrospective series.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00028	it is not necessary to shift the weight-bearing line to fujisawa point in all cases.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00029	mostly we aim to achieve a 2 or 3 degree of valgus. to achieve that the weight-bearing line is shifted just lateral to the lateral tibial spine.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00031	but depending on the prevailing osteoarthritic changes, the weight-bearing line can be shifted further laterally to unload the medial compartment much more effectively.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00032	we know the deformity angles and degrees, but we need to know the size of opening wedge in millimeters to complete the osteotomy. we have few methods, which will help us derive the exact height of the osteotomy wedge in millimeters.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00033	the minayachi method is the one which is popularly used. in a weight-bearing x-ray, the existing weight-bearing line is drawn. the correction point is chosen according to the existing osteoarthritic changes.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00034	and the hinge point is also marked on the lateral tibial cortex. the new weight-bearing line is drawn through the correction point. the new weight-bearing line should be of the same length as the old weight-bearing line.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00035	the distal end of the new line is connected to the hinge point and then on to the center of the ankle joint. the angle made at the hinge point is noted. at this stage if there is a soft tissue varus, any jlca more than 2 degrees should be subtracted from this angle measurement.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00036	a triangle with the hinge point is the apex with the result an angle is drawn. the base of the triangle gives the measurement for the opening wedge. since the x-rays are downsized it is important to calibrate at this stage.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00037	now, the metallic sphere is measured and the calibration ratio is found out and is applied to the measurement. which gives the real life opening distance in millimeters. one can also use various softwares for radiological planning.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00038	but one should be aware of, plotting mistakes, intra-observer and inter-observer variations.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00039	another pitfall one should be aware is the intraarticular deformity of tibia, as following a malunited medial tibial fracture or a blunts disease resulting in a pagoda tibia. here the joint surfaces are incongruent and the patient walks with severe varus thrust.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00040	here an intra-articular osteotomy to lift only the medial tibial condyle is appropriate. doing hto in this situation can result in a teeter effect with a poor result.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00042	another pitfall would be to miss the varus deformity due to soft tissue laxity. this would typically result in an overcorrection as the soft tissue laxity collapses once the knee goes for valgus.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00043	in major corrections, over 12 mm, the resultant mpta angles should be calculated. an mpta of 94 degrees would be acceptable in a correction.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00044	anything more would result in joint shear and can result in poor long-term outcomes. distributing the correction across both femur and tibia, in a double-level osteotomy would prevent joint obliquity.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00045	the tibia normally slopes down posteriorly by 7 to 9 degrees. ideally one should not change the tibial slope during an hto.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00046	however one must remember that the opening wedge osteotomy has a tendency to increase the slope and a closing wedge osteotomy has a tendency to decrease the slope.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00047	in a acl-deficient knee, the slope should not be increased and in a pcl-deficient knee the slope should not be decreased. not only patient selection, but careful radiological planning is crucial for the success of high-tibial osteotomy.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00048	one should always resist a tendency to eyeball or depend on intraoperative checks like diathermy cable or long rods. parallax and positioning errors can lead to significant mistakes. always rely on your preoperative planning values.
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00049	hto is a procedure of perfections. it starts from taking perfect x-rays to careful execution. thanks for your attention.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00001	hello all, my name is kevin dean. i'm a rheumatologist here at the division of rheumatology.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00002	my talk today is going to be an update of a talk i gave back in 2016. i've changed the title to now be updates in the prevention of rheumatoid arthritis.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00004	i have some disclosures around grant funding and consulting from industry.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00006	and then i think these slides are available for everybody, but here's a couple of evidence-based reviews that talk in much more detail about what i'm going to talk about today.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00008	so the disease that i'm focusing on here is rheumatoid arthritis. it's an immune disease that primarily affects the joints,
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00010	it certainly can affect other things, including the lungs. and it's one of the most disabling forms of arthritis. it's also highly prevalent in the population as far as autoimmune disease goes up.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00011	about 1% of the population. and i updated this slide from 2016. i just had to laugh a little bit about the number of name changes our bronco stadium has gone through.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00012	hopefully i got this right. it's now in power field, but 1% of the population. so if you were at a football game, that would be a little over a section full of people with rheumatoid arthritis. so pretty, pretty dramatic number of people with this autoimmune disease.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00014	so it's associated with a lot of things for an individual with disease, pain, fatigue, loss of function. there's also extra articular manifestations. heart disease is actually one of the biggest causes.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00015	killers prematurely in rheumatoid arthritis. so folks with rheumatoid arthritis get heart disease about 10 years earlier than they would if they didn't have rheumatoid arthritis.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00016	there's medication toxicity, very expensive. there's actually overall reduced lifespans. so it's a very impactful disease.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00018	the current paradigm of how we identify and treat rheumatoid arthritis is to treat the disease once it's clinically apparent.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00019	which is once somebody has started to have joint symptoms, pain, stiffness, or swelling, made it through their primary care, gotten an evaluation report,
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00021	figured out that they might have some kind of inflammatory arthritis, finally referred to rheumatology and finally made a diagnosis, which that process has been looked at in the united states takes on average two years from the onset of symptoms to the final diagnosis and treatment for rheumatoid arthritis.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00023	that's too long, the disease actually damages within the first few months of disease. so an overall premise that i'm gonna build on here is what if we could find ra
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00024	and stop it before people actually started having joint damage. i'll talk a bit about the rationale for that statement and that idea, and then talk about what we're doing to try and do that.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00026	so we now know that rheumatoid arthritis has a staged or phased set of things that happen in terms of development. here's a picture.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00027	at which point someone would show up in clinic and get diagnosed. but now we know from a variety of studies that i won't go through in huge detail in a short time today, that there's a preclinical or pre-ra period
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00028	that happens long before this. and on average, three to five years, but it can be up to 15 to 17 years in some studies where genes...
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00029	environmental exposures combine to first trigger a period of asymptomatic autoimmunity and inflammation that's detectable with blood tests or other tests.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00030	now we're realizing that these tests can be abnormal in eucostal surfaces as well.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00032	person can progress, start developing early symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, but nothing you could define it in a clinical exam, i.e. you wouldn't see a swollen joint. then it finally comes to the point where there are signs and symptoms, and you could say, yes, this person has inflammatory arthritis.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00033	and then ultimately classify them as having a rain start treatment.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00035	so i'm going to focus the rest of the talk on this preclinical, also called pre-ra period, and what's happening in that period and how we're planning to intervene to try and prevent the onset of this clinically apparent disease.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00037	so a first little digression here is to help understand how we know about rheumatoid arthritis and how we measure it's going to develop in an individual. there's autoantibodies. i think people are familiar with these.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00038	there's two big systems that we think about in terms of rheumatoid arthritis. there's rheumatoid factor. it's been identified for decades.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00039	there's a newer system that we may be less familiar with. it's called acpa or antibodies to citrullinated protein or peptide antigens, depending who you talk to, but acpa.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00040	the clinical term that we use for the clinical assay that's available in all the labs is called a ccp. so acma is sort of an umbrella term. ccp is the specific clinical term. what this measures is antibodies.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00041	to post-translationally modified arginines into citrulline. so we all make citrulline in our body all the time. it comes along with inflammation, it comes along with normal progression. one of the things,
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00042	the reasons we often don't have webbed fingers is because citrullination occurs within cells and it causes those cells to be orderly
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00043	apoptosis and reabsorbed. so, so it's part of our normal physiology, but unusual is autoimmunity to citrulline proteins. that's highly specific for rheumatoid arthritis.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00045	just to get into the weeds a little bit, but it does help me explain some things a little bit later. the commercial assays,
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00046	for antibodies to sit on a protein are called ccp. they actually measure...
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00047	antibodies to a whole variety of citrullinated proteins, citrullinated vimentin, fibrinogen, other things, but it just gives you a one readout. so just a level.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00048	we can actually break that apart into research assays where we can actually look at antibodies to specific citrulline proteins and actually count them up and say, oh, an individual has reactivity to eight citrulline proteins or 10.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00049	that's going to help understand how we've understood rheumatoid arthritis, but the commercial assay doesn't tell you that. it just gives you kind of one readout. that's a little bit about the antibodies.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00050	now here's my most complicated slide to tell you how we think rheumatoid arthritis develops. i'll walk you through this one to make sure we understand it.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00051	are images from a group of individuals who have blood collected on average
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00052	10 years before they get rheumatoid arthritis, and then after they got diagnosis. and on the left-hand side are people who develop rheumatoid arthritis. on the right-hand side are serial match controls. we got these folks from the department of
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00053	defense serum repository, which is a great resource. if anyone wants to talk about how you can look at natural history of disease, i can i can inform you about that offline.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00054	basically, if an individual's in the military, develops rheumatoid arthritis, you can go find them and then go back in time and find blood that's been collected through this department of defense serum collection system and look at blood before they get diseased. so that's a background to this slide.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00055	individuals on the left-hand panel will focus their developed rheumatoid arthritis at this time point.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00057	and then these are sort of intervals before they develop rheumatoid arthritis. this is back to that point i made earlier. you can measure individual antibodies to a variety of citrulline antigens. if you just squint at this slide,
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00058	you can see that the red color increases over time. that means individuals are developing more and more
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00059	autoantibodies to a variety of citronella proteins. they start off with very few, they get more and more and more and progress to the point where they get ra, they have a lot of autoantibodies. and then this is that threshold they cross and develop clinical apparent disease.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00061	following that, also there's an elevation of inflammation that goes along with that. you won't be able to read this, but there's a whole list of cytokines down below. if you can kind of squint the red line.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00062	increase over time to the point at which a rheumatoid arthritis clinically develops. and you can see there's a basically storm of inflammation through a variety of cytokines.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00064	importantly, this doesn't happen in folks who do not get rheumatoid arthritis. so if you just look at the red colors on the right-hand panels here, there's not that increase of redness. so this is really unique and specific for rheumatoid arthritis.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00066	there's of course other immune systems that are going abnormal in this period. there's rheumatoid factors also developing along with these antibodies to citronated proteins. there's a whole host of new antibody systems that we're learning about as we go. i won't go into that in great detail.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00067	there's growing number of cellular studies in this period as well. and kind of at a lay person level, we wouldn't can think of this as a little bit of inflammation at a candle level,
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00068	probably five to 10 years before you get rheumatoid arthritis, a campfire level a couple of years before, and finally full blown fire, which is the clinical disease of rheumatoid arthritis.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00070	so you can start trimming this down and looking at this in a little bit clearer way. and if you just count the number of acpas, we're referring back a couple of slides back, where an individual can have antibodies to one citrulline protein or another. if you just count those up,
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00072	what happens is people start off with a low number of antibodies to citrine proteins that increases over time to the point at which they get rheumatoid arthritis. if you count the number of cytokines that are elevated, that increases over time.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00074	and importantly, understanding that model of how ra has developed has led to ways to use antibodies to predict who is going to get rheumatoid arthritis in the future.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00075	and it can be boiled down even more simply with a ccp assay. and i won't go into the details here, but
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00076	one of the more common assays is a ccp3, which is just a commercial version. you can use one single assay that gives you a single readout. levels can go...
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00077	from very low or what would be considered normal, increase over time, cross a threshold at which point they're considered positive, and then increase in a person finally develops rheumatoid arthritis.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00078	this makes prediction quite simple because one can now use one commercial assay and say, what is your level? and then get an estimate of your overall risk for rheumatoid arthritis, as well as
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00080	what time period in the near future you may develop rheumatoid arthritis. so this figure kind of tells you that. you can see levels can go up in the level here,
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00081	is on average two to four years before somebody gets rheumatoid arthritis. and this is a level which i won't show you this picture is unheard of in somebody who doesn't go on to get rheumatoid arthritis. so both specific for disease and helpful in terms of timing of prediction of future disease.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00083	in fact, you can boil this down to a simple model where a ccp3 of greater than 40 units gives an overall risk of 50% for developing rheumatoid arthritis within the next three years.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00085	so what is helpful here is these acpa tests, in particular, that commercial assay ccp,
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00087	is very specific for rheumatoid arthritis. indeed, if you have synovitis, it looks like rheumatoid arthritis and this test is positive, it's really over 90% specific.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00088	if you don't have synovitis, there's probably a 90% positive predictive value in some case control studies.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00089	maybe as low as 30% in dollars, but really a high positive predictive value that you will develop a rent-worth risk in the future.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00091	but certainly, as i've mentioned before, likelihood and timing need to be addressed in prediction. that's where that model of the test being positive and positive at a certain level gets you both likelihood and timing of rheumatoid arthritis. now, importantly, this is underpinned.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00092	prevention studies in rheumatoid arthritis, where one can go out, find individuals who have elevations of these biomarkers, and then intervene to try and prevent or delay them from going on to get rheumatoid arthritis.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00093	and there's a bit of a landscape of ra prevention that's evolved since i gave this talk in 2016. there was one known study, which is called the dutch dexamethasone study.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00094	where individuals that had either high levels of rheumatoid factor or acpa and had some aches and pains, but no inflammatory arthritis were given two doses of dexamethasone at a pretty whopping dose. it did not progress, did not halt progression to inflammatory arthritis
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00095	it decreased the autoantibodies a little bit, but this was overall considered a negative study. that was followed up by a study called prairie, which was published in 2019.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00097	where people who are positive for acpa and a rheumatoid factor received one dose of the b-cell depleting agent rituximab. it actually did not decrease in overall progression of inflammatory arthritis, but it did decrease.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00098	slow the onset of disease. so thought to be a successful trial, although it wasn't a complete prevention. a couple other studies have had readouts recently, a study called stap-ra-1,
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00099	where people were given atorvastatin to try and intervene in folks that were acpa positive to try and prevent future disease. the atorvastatin did not work at all.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00101	the rationale behind that was because we know that atorvastatin actually, in addition to cholesterol modulating factors, has some immune factors. that was the rationale for that drug, but it did not work. and so it's taken it out of the running for trying to prevent future rheumatoid arthritis.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00102	and then this is just kind of breaking news. it's only been an abstract form in the last couple of months here. a study in germany where an individual that might have acpa positivity or the ccp assay
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00103	plus evidence of inflammation in a joint on mri, but that's not something you could see on physical exam, or given a drug called abatacept, which is a t-cell co-stimulation blocker,
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00104	versus a placebo. and an early readout here is that it's actually decreasing the progression of rheumatoid arthritis. very exciting findings, but that needs to be fleshed out.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00106	but with that as background, a few years back, we developed our own prevention study that we call stop-ra. and the big name is strategy to prevent the onset of clinically apparent rheumatoid arthritis. this was funded by the nih and niaid.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00107	through a special branch, the audiomini centers of excellence. we're the principal site here. we developed the study, but we're operating on multiple sites across the country.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00108	i think my colleagues, chris strybik and mike colors and marie faser, who's been our primary study coordinator here who have really helped launch this study. i think all of our rheumatologists in the state,
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00109	a lot of rheumatologists across the country in a cast of thousands, which is sort of a joke, but i'll tell you, it's not actually a joke when you see what we've had to do with this study.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00110	so what we did with this study, development inclusion criteria, harkening back to a couple slides back, where we used this acpa test, the ccp3 test, it was two times normal.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00111	without a history of inflammatory arthritis with a projected rate of development of rheumatoid arthritis of 50% by three years. we have subsequently learned that that might be a little bit of an overestimate, but i think that still needs to be...
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00112	still needs to be evaluated further. that has some importance with the slide i'm gonna show you in the next couple of slides. the intervention that we selected here
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00113	was a randomized blinded placebo controlled study using the drug hydroxychloroquine, which is a bit of a mystery on how it works. it was originally used for malaria treatment
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00114	probably because it elevates the ph inside of cells, causing it to be an unhospitable environment for malaria.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00116	that probably also alters immune function of cells and dampens it a bit, makes cells less auto-reactive, less inflammatory. and we think that's a mechanism why it works in a variety of diseases include lupus and remantar thrush, which is used widely for.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00117	the intervention was giving the drug for one year, stopping, following two years of follow-up after that to see if the drug worked, was there a durable response.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00118	it was going to be shoot the moon hypothesis, a time limited drug intervention in this preclinical ra period would reset immunity, lead to lasting improvement.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00119	the endpoints were development of classifiable rheumatoid arthritis, which harken back to those pictures i showed you earlier, basically a patient with swollen joints.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00120	safety was also a primary outcome. study design, just real briefly, an individual would come into the study, get one year study drug with a few visits, and then two years off a study drug and to follow up.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00121	so we've actually completed randomization of the study and we're now in the follow-up phase. a couple people are still on study drug.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00122	we've randomized 140 subjects, which we revised that. we were aiming for 200 to start with. and some interim analyzes realized we could do with a little less people and find a significant result.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00123	and the study's ongoing, so you won't get a punchline here today. hopefully, we will have this read out very soon, and i will be able to
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00124	provide us and the world, frankly, with the results from the study. i will just spend a couple of minutes here. if you're going to develop an agent that you can
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00125	put into an at-risk period of disease, there's a lot of considerations that have to go into that. is it going to work? is it going to be safe? is it going to be tolerated? is it going to be cost effective? are people going to be willing to take it? so we
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00126	considered all these things had some focus groups a few years back when we were launching this study
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00127	and we arrived at this drug called hydroxychloroquine or plaquenil, which
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00128	no one had ever heard of before covid came along. and then suddenly even the president's talking about this on news conferences. so a lot of people are still aware of it.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00129	it is something we use widely in rheumatoid arthritis already if you have established disease in lupus, but this was our family choice. another aspect that came into this was it was a drug that anyone
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00130	could prescribe. it's pretty safe. it doesn't really require specialist management of the agent.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00131	it's going to work. it's be a great drug. so this is why we're trying it. as one of my colleagues, chris jurek has said,
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00132	this is a drug that either has to succeed or fail because if we don't look at this drug as commonly used in ra, people would always wonder, does it work? because it's so safe and if it's effective, that will be a great option. so this is why we looked at it.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00133	and i will just say, here's the joke slide. this is lakeside park here in denver. ask me sometime offline.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00134	about using a drug hydroxychloroquine in a study that when you started it, no one had ever heard of the drug and suddenly everybody wants to take the drug to prevent covid for a few months there. and indeed, the nih came to us
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00135	when it was looking early days like there's some question of whether covid looked like it was going to work about stopping our study and diverting all of the hydroxychloroquine we had
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00136	for our study into clinical trials against covid. it's hard to argue against that if it's thought to be lifesaving, but fortunately that died down. our study kept going basically uninterrupted throughout the covid crisis.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00138	um,
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00140	so our enrollment goals for the study were actually higher. and as i said, we lowered that estimate. we completed enrollment or randomization for 144 subjects back in november.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00142	it was certainly a challenge. so if you think a disease, like harking back to that picture of the bronco stadium, 1% of people are affected by rheumatoid arthritis. so that means,
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00143	maybe 1% or people are walking around out there who are at risk for future rheumatoid arthritis. it's probably even lower than that, right? because not everybody's actually going to get rheumatoid arthritis. so the challenge is of how do you go to a,
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00144	group of people find who is ccp positive and going to get rheumatoid arthritis in the future. and then the next part to that is how to get them to participate in the study. and that's been a huge challenge of the project for stop-ra
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00145	and if i can't thank people enough, we thank the 17 study sites across the country that have participated, as well as a huge effort of the state of colorado. we've had a lot of things come together to help us with.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00146	enrollment for the study. we've worked closely with the nine health fair, the arthritis foundation, the campus here, a lot of providers on campus who found these folks in their clinics and referred them to us, a lot of rheumatologists across the state.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00147	so a variety of ways, testing first degree relatives or fdrs of people with rheumatoid arthritis gets you a higher risk group
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00148	for future rheumatoid arthritis. sometimes people show up in rheumatology clinics or primary care clinics with aches and pains and they test positive for ccp, but don't have inflammation in their joints yet.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00149	and then we can do some population-based approaches. i've already mentioned we used the nine health fairs here in colorado extensively. other groups that have participated with us, including groups in oklahoma, added on a ccp test and a short consent.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00150	to about 5,000 people who donated blood in oklahoma, tested them all for ccp and recruited a large number of folks out of that group to participate in our study.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00151	we've looked at some other store biobanks at sites including mayo clinic and brigham and women's hospital and found ccp positive that way.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00152	so the scope of this, and i'll just kind of boil this down in the interest of time, is we've tested in the past few years 30,000 individuals for ccp at 17 sites across the country.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00153	at a rate of about 1.5% positive, or about 450 individuals were ccp positive. i left this out at a level of ccp at two times the normal cutoff, so a little bit higher than just an average positive test.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00154	and we were able to, out of that 450 people, randomize the 144 or about 30%. now, a bunch of those folks...
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00155	join the study. fortunately, some were willing to get tested and even been then presented with the the drug hydroxychloroquine didn't really want to take a medicine because they felt well, so dropped out for that ways.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00156	and a portion of those folks dropped out of the study because they actually wound up having undiagnosed rheumatoid arthritis. and so that's some additional challenges when you get into the prevention game and start screening for people,
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00157	one, finding people to test. the test is fortunately specific for ra, so one avoids
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00158	mostly finding other conditions that you got to worry about. this is a consideration, especially with the ra test rheumatoid factor, which can be elevated in hep.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00159	see chronic infections or malignancy. so if you find somebody who's rheumatoid factor positive in absence of ccp, you got to worry about all these other conditions you may have inadvertently discovered.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00160	but really ccp avoids most of that. but one of the biggest challenges we've had in the study is previously undiagnosed rheumatoid arthritis. and once you find somebody in the screening pathway to identify that,
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00161	and identify a pathway to care for those individuals. that's a lot of ethics around that. if you find somebody in your screening,
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00163	that has the disease of interest and they're not good for your prevention, how do you help them get to the right place?
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00165	so this is the cliffhanger here. the interim analysis of the study is pending, but we have some early data that 30% of subjects have developed rheumatoid arthritis as part of the study.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00166	that's a bittersweet finding. i would just say anybody who's ccp positive really doesn't think they're gonna get rheumatoid arthritis or certainly doesn't wanna get it, but it is important in this prevention study to actually have people get your outcome of interest to see if your intervention can actually
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00167	lower an individual's risk for going forward. so i will keep the campus and the world posted on this as we learn more in the next few months, hopefully, because we fully randomize and we'll be able to have at least a good interim readout very soon.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00169	so.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00171	in thinking about this trial, think about some of the trials that came before it or have been published since we started this, it's really mostly critical to learn everything we can about all aspects of prevention as we move ahead, because,
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00172	and admittedly, when we started this, we had some grasp of the concepts that we were going to have to deal with. but as we've moved through this, the whole process, there's just huge challenges in trying to identify and screen and prevent a disease.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00173	and this slide is very busy, but it has a lot of the elements that have to come together. i'd say the most important thing is finding subjects or individuals who are at risk for disease and getting them to participate. that's critically important. certainly finding the
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00174	funding from a variety of sources, getting industry to participate. you can envision industry in rheumatoid arthritis as a model that's built on, once you get disease, it's a forever disease, we gotta keep giving you drugs forever.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00175	but if a prevention approach actually abrogated that or changed that, industry may have a very different look at a disease. and so you really want to have them interested in wanting to push for prevention.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00176	dr. matthew shollin- measuring lots of other things, including outcomes is very important. dr. matthew shollin- getting healthcare systems to participate in this ultimately if we find a drug that works to prevent rheumatoid arthritis, how to launch that into actual clinical care, a lot of things to think about.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00177	i will say probably the most important thing, thinking about some of the drugs that we thought were going to work really well to prevent ra that was published already, rituximab,
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00178	dr. matthew shollin- steroids and then we'll have to see if that by task after this t cell co stimulation works, but thinking about the basic science of this disease development, do we really know what we're doing with our interventions are we making the right choices.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00180	and really this slide kind of highlights the statement here, understanding the ra pathogenesis is rapidly advancing and it'll actually fundamentally probably change our next prevention trials.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00181	the good news is, is i think we have now set in the field that you can find people who are at risk for future rheumatoid arthritis and who will get rheumatoid arthritis.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00182	i think the field has also thought it's probably worthwhile trying to intervene to prevent this disease. those are two huge hurdles. now finding the right approach to prevention is the next big step.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00183	and just a shout out to some members of my division. i think you're gonna hear some other talks through the same lecture system going forward about these things, including a mucosal hypothesis, which i won't go into in huge detail today, but to touch on this,
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00184	christy kuhn, kristin demerol, both in the division of rheumatology. megan criswell, who's a grad student, has been working on this extensively.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00185	uh help us understand that the early phases of rheumatoid arthritis may not be in the joints at all but other sites i think it'll be groundbreaking for how we approach prevention in the future
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00187	so i have a figure to kind of highlight this here. ultimately, when we wanna think about rheumatoid arthritis, how it develops and where we might be able to prevent, we wanna intervene in the future
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00188	with approaches that are rooted in stage-specific biology.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00190	so if we have a person who on the right-hand side has joint disease and involvement in rheumatoid arthritis, where we have lots of experience in developing drugs and intervening with drugs, now we've taken that experience and moved that, all those drugs,
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00191	into an earlier phase of rheumatoid arthritis. hydroxychloroquine, even atorvastat and all the other drugs i've talked about are all well-studied in the articular disease of rheumatoid arthritis. we're moving them and that makes a lot of sense
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00192	approval like the fda wouldn't approve a drug that's novel in prevention of ra unless it's already been tried in the existing disease, so that helps it.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00193	so this makes a lot of sense. but i think where we want to think about going forward in rheumatoid arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis prevention is understanding this propagation or systemic immune phase without the arthritis and
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00194	and identify what are the novel targets in this period.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00195	precisely identify those in forgiven individuals, maybe they're mucosal. and then really what i want to say is make the punishment fit the crime. so if i can, uh, um,
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00196	profile autoimmunity as a crime of health. we want to be able to understand it and then target that appropriately. so we really balance efficacy of an agent
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00197	versus risk and benefit. so we do the right thing to try and prevent future disease.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00198	hopefully this will not only work for rheumatoid arthritis in the near future, so we're looking forward to readouts.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00199	certainly stop or raise an ra focused thing, but we have a lot of other autoimmune or rheumatic diseases that may be following similar models of development where there's a pre-disease period that we can intervene upon.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00200	i'm actually trials are underway now in lupus that are similar and designed to stop r.a.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00202	some studies in gout, there's some studies in ankylosing spondylitis and related disease, including psoriatic arthritis to train
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00203	i intervene early to prevent an end organ toxicity or damage from that. so it's very exciting. i think many of you already know about lots of extensive work in type 1 diabetes. so i won't go into that today.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00204	but this is kind of the big dream. if we can develop models to take somebody from a healthy standpoint, from whatever organ you're interested in,
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00205	intervene with studies such as stop already developed ways to prevent. i think that's, that's where we'd like to go with rheumatoid arthritis and other disease. frankly, i'm tired as a rheumatologist to wait until sick people come into clinic. if we can go out and find them earlier and intervene earlier, i think that's going to be great.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00207	my last slide is the take, there's too many people to put on this. so i thank some key people,
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00209	my boss, mike holers, and jill norris, his wife, have developed a lot of these early studies and really set a foundational framework for the development of this. the.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00210	the original studies were under the umbrella of the studies of the etiologist rheumatoid thrombosis, sarah, my colleague, christopher stubake and our state coordinator who's driven forward a lot of this, maria fraser, have been huge help. kristen demerol, christy kuhn,
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00211	our now division head, dwayne pearson, have been hugely instrumental in driving a lot of these forward. we've had lots of funding from lots of agencies. mostly i'd like to thank the nih,
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00212	aid who have supported our stop ra trial, but we're getting a lot of other institutional funding and others to move this ahead.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00213	and with that, i will stop and leave the slide and address any questions. i think i've still the last talk, right? i've gone a little over, but hopefully there's time for questions.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00215	if there are any questions, you can please enter them in the chat.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00217	i think i can see the chat, but i can see it better if i stop share. so i'm going to stop sharing if that's all right.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00219	natalie, maybe if you can say, i don't see any questions in the chat.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00220	i don't see any either. i'm not missing anything.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00222	pb, peter vitale he & him ctei colin
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00226	where do isgs fit into your evaluations?
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00228	so what is an isg?
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00230	so interferon-stimulated genes, they certainly don't fit into any clinical assessments or laboratory assessments that you do now.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00231	that said, there is a growing understanding that there may be an interferon signal
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00232	in the early pre-ra period. you've opened the door for a discussion here. we don't think interferon is a huge player in established rheumatoid arthritis.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00233	but biologically, it looked like it might be from older studies, including systemic inflammation and actually articular inflammation that interferon might play a role. you know, interferon blockade did not work well.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00234	doesn't mean it's not important in staple's disease, but at least the drugs we had didn't work well. we think that actually they may play an incredibly important part in this very early phase
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00235	so this is part of that picture i showed where things we know work in established rheumatoid arthritis may actually be different than what we need to use in earlier disease. and so
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00236	interferon-interferon-stimulated disease are a new target for thinking about in terms of preclinical disease, because maybe at that earlier stage, these are much more critically important pathways.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00237	the concept is there. we're trying to now understand exactly what pathways are there to be able to target them effectively.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00239	are there any other questions from anyone?
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00241	well, dr. dean, thank you. i apologize. our moderator couldn't make it today, but we appreciate your speaking.
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00243	hey, thanks. thanks for the opportunity. and i think everybody has my email from campus. if you have any questions, come up later. thank you. bye bye.
