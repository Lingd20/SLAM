YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00001	SO LET ME INTRODUCE OUR FIRST SPEAKER WHO IS STEIN VAN DER PLOOG
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00003	FUNDERPOO IS THE SPECIAL PROJECTS ADVISER AT WILD ANIMAL INITIATIVE AND ALSO OFFERED COACHING AND CONSULTING THE TO NEW EFFECTIVE ANIMAL ADVOCACY GROUPS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00005	SO RIGHT NOW I TEST THE MICROPHONE TO YOU SEEING
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00007	THANK YOU VIANCA AND THANK YOU FOR CAREFULLY PRONOUNCING MY NAME
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00008	AND MONICA TO ALSO THANKS FOR HOSTING THIS I'M SURE YOU'RE VERY TIRED ON THIS LAST DAY BUT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AT LEAST EVERYTHING HAS GONE VERY WELL THESE LAST TWO DAYS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00010	SO I WILL SWITCH NOW TO SHARING MY SCREEN HOPEFULLY I CAN MAKE THAT WORK
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00012	YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00014	LET'S SEE IF YOU CANNOT SEE THIS CAN YOU SIGNAL OKAY GREAT
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00016	SO YEAH I THINK YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A MANAGER TO LEAD
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00018	AND UM I WILL TRY TO EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY TODAY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00020	SO HELLO EVERYONE NICE TO SEE A WHOLE BUNCH OF FAMILIAR FACES HERE I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE USING YOUR SUNDAY AFTERNOON FOR SOME PEOPLE SUNDAY VERY EARLY MORNING UM TO BE HERE TO LEARN HOW YOU CAN BETTER PROTECT ANIMALS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00022	I JUST FINISHED A CIPHI NOVEL ABOUT ANARCHY I AM A PRODUCT OF COLONIALISM I DON'T DEPEND ON MY WORK FOR MONEY AND I HAVE SUCH ISSUES WITH AUTHORITY THAT I WON'T EVEN FOLLOW RECIPE INSTRUCTIONS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00024	THAT IS NOT MY USUAL INTRODUCTION TO WHO STEINHORN ORGANIZATION BUT I THINK IT'S HELPFUL FOR YOU TO KNOW WHERE I'M COMING FROM SO YOU FEEL ENCOURAGED TO LISTEN TO ME WITH AN OPEN MIND TO WHY I THINK YOU CAN AND SHOULD LEAD EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT A MANAGER
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00026	I HOPE YOU WILL YOU WILL BE SKEPTICAL NOT JUST OF ME BUT OF ALL LEADERSHIP STRATEGIES YOU LEARN ABOUT THERE ARE MILLIONS OF BOOKS AND CLASSES AND PODCASTS ABOUT LEADERSHIP
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00027	BUT THE HEART DATA AVAILABLE IS PRETTY LIMITED AND ON TOP OF THAT YOUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE YOUR CAUSE THE STRUCTURE OF YOUR ORGANIZATION ALL INFLUENCE WHAT TYPE OF LEADERSHIP WORKS BEST IN YOUR SITUATION AND INDUSTRY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00029	TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT MY PROFESSIONAL SITUATION I HAVE WORKED AT VARIOUS NON PROFITS OVER FIFTEEN YEARS IN FUNDRAISING ADMINISTRATION OPERATIONS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00030	AND I JUST STARTED TO WORK FOR WILD ANIMAL INITIATIVE
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00032	AT WILD ANIMAL INITIATIVE MY SUPER SMART AND COMPASSIONATE COLLEAGUES AT THIS RESEARCH INSTITUTE WORK TO UNDERSTAND AND IMPROVE THE LIVES OF FREE RANGING SENTIENT ANIMALS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00033	BESIDES THAT WORK I OFFER PROJECT BASED SUPPORT TO NEW EFFECTIVE ANIMAL ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS AS BIANCA SAID EARLIER I AM LUCKY ENOUGH TO DO ALL MY WORK FOR FREE WITHOUT TAKING SALARY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00035	SO THE IDEAS I WILL SHARE WITH YOU TODAY HAVE LARGELY BEEN STOLEN FROM THESE BOOKS AND A BUNCH OF OTHERS AND FROM ARTICLES AND PODCASTS BUT ALSO FROM VARIOUS COURSES AND CLASSES
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00036	SOME DIRECTLY ABOUT PEOPLE MANAGEMENT OTHERS ABOUT CRITICAL THINKING EFFECTIVE ALTRUISM DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION OR NEGOTIATION BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00038	UM I HAVE LEARNED FROM DOING AND I HAVE LEARNED FROM THESE PEOPLE THESE ARE SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES AT THE VARIOUS CHARITIES I'VE WORKED FOR
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00039	AND YOU CAN MAYBE PICK ME OUT IN ALL OF THESE PICTURES BUT THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT WITH HOW SMALL THE FACES ARE
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00040	BUT UM YEAH I'VE LEARNED MORE FROM THESE PEOPLE THAN I HAVE FROM READING AND TRAINING OR FROM READING AND TRAINING COMBINED
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00041	I'VE LEARNED FROM MAKING MISTAKES FROM PEOPLE'S FEEDBACK AND THROUGH US MOSIS BEING AROUND PEOPLE WHO LEAD AND EXPERIENCING WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOESN'T AND FROM TALKING AND LISTENING TO THESE PEOPLE
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00042	IN THE CENTER YOU ALSO SEE ME WITH MY PARTNER THAT WAS A PREACHER ON MY FORTIETH BIRTHDAY HE IS A SENIOR DIRECTOR AT A SOFTWARE COMPANY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00043	AND I LEARN DAILY FROM HIS IDEAS FROM HIS SUCCESSES AND HIS CHALLENGES AND HE ALSO GIVES ME INSIGHT INTO HOW THINGS ARE DONE IN THE CORPORATE WORLD WHICH I HAVEN'T HAD THAT MUCH EXPOSURE
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00045	SO NOW YOU KNOW HOW I LEARNED THE THINGS I'LL SHARE BUT WHAT IS IT EXACTLY THAT I HOPE YOU'LL LEARN
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00047	WELL I UM WILL NOT BLOW YOUR MIND WITH NOVEL IDEAS I WILL SHARE WHAT I THINK ARE SOME COMMON SENSE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU CAN TRY TO TURN INTO COMMON PRACTICE
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00048	TO ME LEADERSHIP IS ABOUT THE IMPACT YOU CAN HAVE ON OTHERS IRRESPECTIVE OF YOUR AUTHORITY IN THIS TALK I'LL GO OVER FOUR WAYS TO INFLUENCE OTHERS SO YOU CAN DO MORE GOOD TOGETHER
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00049	I WILL EXPLAIN WHY I THINK YOU SHOULD QUESTION IDEAS PLANS ASSUMPTIONS AND THE BEHAVIOR OF YOUR CO WORKERS INCLUDING YOUR MANAGERS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00051	INSPIRE YOUR COLLEAGUES AND SHOW THEM THE DIFFERENCE THEY MAKE
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00053	SUPPORT YOUR CO WORKERS DEVELOPMENT AND CONNECT WITH YOUR TEAM SO PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY BELONG THESE FOUR PILLARS WILL STRENGTHEN YOUR LEADERSHIP I HATE THE WORD STRENGTHEN I CANNOT PRONOUNCE IT
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00055	AFTERWARDS I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU WHAT YOU THINK AND HEAR ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCES AND OH WAY AT THE END WE SHOULD HAVE TIME TO GO OVER YOUR QUESTIONS IN SLIDO
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00057	SO WHY DO I THINK YOU SHOULD LEAD
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00059	WELL THIS WHOLE PRESENTATION RESTS ON FOUR ASSUMPTIONS I HAVE ABOUT YOU I THINK YOU WANT TO HELP MORE ANIMALS YOU KNOW SOME INTERVENTIONS AND WORK METHODS ARE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN OTHERS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00061	YOU WANT TO FEEL VALUED LIKE YOU MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND LIKE YOU BELONG
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00063	YOU WANT YOUR COWORKERS TO FEEL THE SAME SO BASED ON THESE ASSUMPTIONS I BELIEVE IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO TRY TO LEAD YOUR TEAM AND ORGANIZATION IN THE DIRECTION THAT HELPS THE MOST ANIMALS AND THOSE ANIMALS INCLUDE YOUR COWORKERS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00065	IT IS NOT JUST YOUR MORAL DUTY I THINK TO STAND UP FOR WHAT IS RIGHT WE MUST TRY TO DO THE MOST GOOD WE CAN
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00067	WHEN YOU LEAD YOU WILL PREVENT BURNOUT
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00069	PHONOLITICS FOUND PEOPLE LEAVE OR ANIMAL ORGANIZATIONS DUE TO LEADERSHIP AND BURNOUT
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00070	YOUR LEADERSHIP CAN IMPROVE TEAM SPIRIT CREATE A TRUSTING OPEN AND SAFE ENVIRONMENT CONTRIBUTE TO A NO BLAME CULTURE AND SHOW THE DIFFERENCE YOUR COLLECTIVE WORK IS MAKING
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00072	THIS WILL MAKE IT LESS LIKELY THAT YOUR THAT YOU OR THE PEOPLE ON YOUR TEAM WILL SUFFER FROM MENTAL AND PHYSICAL STRESS AND EXHAUSTION
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00074	YOU WILL HELP MORE ANIMALS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00076	AS YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD JAMIE SAY YESTERDAY ANIMAL ADVOCACY CAREERS FOUND CEOS AND HIRING PROFESSIONALS IN EFFECTIVE ANIMAL ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS IDENTIFIED LEADERSHIP AS ONE OF THE MOST URGENT SKILL GAPS IN OUR MOVEMENT
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00077	SO YOUR LEADERSHIP WILL MAKE THE MOVEMENT MORE EFFECTIVE YOU CAN HELP FILL THOSE GAPS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00079	PRACTICING LEADERSHIP WILL ALSO LEAD TO PERSONAL GROWTH
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00081	YOU GAIN MORE CONFIDENCE YOU FEEL MORE IN CONTROL AND YOU STRENGTHEN NOT JUST YOUR PROFESSIONAL BUT ALSO YOUR PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00083	BUT LEADING WHEN YOU'RE NOT IN MANAGEMENT IS NOT ALWAYS EASY SOME PEOPLE MIGHT NOT APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DO HIERARCHICAL ORGANIZATIONS AND MANAGERS STUCK TO THEIR WAYS MIGHT LABEL YOU DIFFICULT
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00085	BUT YOU WILL HAVE TO STAND UP FOR WHAT IS RIGHT YOU MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR HOW YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES ARE TREATED
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00087	AND YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE YOU CAN SAVE MORE ANIMALS AND YOU CAN PROBABLY EXPERIENCE MORE JOY IN YOUR WORK THAN YOU THINK YOU CAN
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00089	SO TO GET TO THE FIRST UM POINT
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00091	QUESTION IDEAS PLANS ASSUMPTIONS AND BEHAVIORS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00093	IT IS NORMAL IN EACH OF OUR COUNTRIES TO USE ANIMALS AS PRODUCTS TO SEEMOUS THINGS TO KILL AND EAT THEM YOU GREW UP AND STILL LIVE IN A CULTURE WHERE FEW PEOPLE QUESTION THOSE NORMS BUT YOU DID
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00094	IT DIDN'T MATTER THAT MOST PEOPLE FOLLOW TO THE CUSTOMS OF ANIMAL ABUSE YOU FELT IT WAS WRONG DID RESEARCH AND ARE WORKING TO CHANGE THE STATUS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00096	YOU CAN USE THAT SAME CURIOSITY HUMILITY AND COMPASSION OF MORAL COMPASSION OF YOURS TO MAKE YOUR ORGANIZATION MORE EFFECTIVE
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00098	LIKE MAYBE YOU DON'T LIKE THE PERFORMANCE REVIEWS OR HOW MEETINGS ARE RUN OR MAYBE YOU WONDER WHY SOME SPECIFIC TASKS ARE IMPORTANT FOR ANIMALS TO LEAD BETTER LIVES IS THERE EVIDENCE FOR THAT DID SOMEONE TEST IF THIS WORKS BEST
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00100	THE MANAGERS AND EXECUTIVES IN YOUR ORGANIZATION MIGHT ALSO NOT HAVE THE FULL PICTURE OR FULLY GRASP WHAT THE DAY TO DAY WORK ON THE GROUND IS LIKE YOUR PERSPECTIVE IS HELPFUL IN FINDING THE BEST OPTION
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00102	BECAUSE OF YOUR POSITION YOU MIGHT ALSO BE BETTER AT TAKING THE LEAD ON CERTAIN ISSUES AS SOMEONE WITHOUT HIERARCHICAL AUTHORITY YOU ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE BLINDED BY THE POWER YOU HAVE MULTIPLE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00103	THAT POWER AND PRIVILEGE INFLUENCE ONE'S ABILITY TO MAKE EVIDENCE BASED DECISIONS WITH AN OPEN MIND
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00105	WISDOM ACCORDING TO PLATO AND A BUNCH OF OTHER PEOPLE SINCE THEN IS KNOWING WHAT YOU KNOW AND KNOWING WHAT YOU DON'T
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00107	IT CAN BE HARDER FOR THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE TO KNOW WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW YOU ON THE OTHER HAND MIGHT BE BETTER ABLE TO THINK CRITICALLY HOW AN OPERATION SYSTEM OR A CORPORATE CAMPAIGN COULD WORK
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00109	AND YOU MUST SHARE THAT PERSPECTIVE SO ASK WHY REPEATEDLY WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00111	KNOWING WHY SOMETHING IS IMPORTANT FOR THE MISSION TO SUCCEED AND HOW IT WORKS WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU TO DO IT YOU ASKING QUESTIONS WILL ALSO MAKE IT EASIER FOR OTHERS TO SPEAK UP WHY DOES THIS MEETING LEAD TO SAVE MORE ANIMALS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00112	WHY DOES THIS CAGE FREE STRATEGY LEAD TO LESS SUFFERING WHY ARE THESE PEOPLE ON YOUR GOVERNING BOARD
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00114	WHEN YOU DIG INTO THESE WISE YOU CLARIFY THE WORK FOR OTHERS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00116	THEN BE NOISY AND NOISY OR BE CURIOUS AND DIFFICULT
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00118	IF YOU ARE THE SMART AND SILENT TYPE WHO FIXES MISTAKES WITHOUT CONFRONTING THE ERROR MAKERS YOU ACTUALLY ARE UNDERMINING ORGANIZATIONAL LEARNING
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00119	IF YOU THINK SOMETHING COULD POSSIBLY BE DONE BETTER BUT YOU DON'T SPEAK UP YOU MIGHT SAY FEWER ANIMALS SO PLEASE BE NOISY AND NOISY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00121	AND DON'T FORGET TO QUESTION YOUR OWN IDEAS AND ACTIONS EITHER IS WHAT YOU'RE DOING REALLY THE BEST WAY TO GET RESULTS HOW DO YOU KNOW MAYBE ASK THE OPINION OF SOMEONE WHO'S WILLING TO DISAGREE WITH YOU
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00123	THEN INSPIRE
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00125	HOW SHOW PEOPLE HOW THE DIFFERENCE UH WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT WE CAN MAKE TOGETHER
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00127	PHONOLOGISTS AGAIN GREAT ORGANIZATION THEY FOUND THAT DISSATISFACTION WITH A TYPE OF ADVOCACY AND NOT FEELING LIKE YOU MAKE A DIFFERENCE ARE BIG REASONS THAT PEOPLE LEAVE ANIMAL ADVOCACY MOVEMENT
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00129	YOU CAN RECONNECT PEOPLE TO THEIR MOTIVATION YOU CAN HELP THEM SEE THE IMPACT THEY HAVE BY INSPIRING PEOPLE YOU LIGHT THEM INTO ACTION SO TOGETHER WE CAN DO IT
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00131	BILLIONS OF FARMED ANIMALS WILL CONTINUE TO BE MURDERED EVERY YEAR
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00133	WE STILL KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE EXPERIENCES OF ANIMALS IN THE WILD BUT ALONE ABOUT HOW TO SUSTAINABLY REDUCE THEIR SUFFERING THOSE FACTS ARE
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00135	BUT I'M ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT THAT WE ARE BUILDING THE ROADS TOWARDS THE FUTURE IN WHICH HUMANITY CARES FOR ANIMALS THE ACTIONS WE TAKE TODAY CAN SPARE A VAST NUMBER OF ANIMALS A LIFETIME OF SUFFERING JUST YEARS FROM NOW
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00137	SO MANY FISHES CHICKENS TADPOLES PIGS I CANNOT EVEN IMAGINE THEY'LL HAVE BETTER LIVES
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00139	AND MUCH STANDS IN OUR WAY BUT TOGETHER WE CAN BUILD NOT JUST ROADS BUT ROCKETS TO A BETTER FUTURE
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00141	I HOPE YOU REMEMBER THIS AND REMIND EACH OTHER WHEN THINGS GET HARD THAT OUR WORK MAKES A DIFFERENCE FOR REAL INDIVIDUALS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00143	MAKE THE INVISIBLE CLEAR SPREADSHEETS MAKE ANIMALS HAPPIER
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00145	SOMETIMES WE NEED TO DO THINGS THAT SEEM FAR REMOVED FROM PROTECTING ANIMALS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00147	FILLING OUT SPREADSHEETS RAISING MONEY CREATING BUDGETS ADMINISTRATION WE'RE NOT ALL RESCUING FOXES FROM FUR FARMS REMIND YOURSELF AND OTHERS HOW MUNDANE TASKS RELATE TO A BETTER WORLD
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00148	WHEN I COMPARE LAST YEAR'S AVERAGE DONATIONS TO THIS YEAR'S THAT MEANS I WILL HAVE MORE INFORMATION TO RAISE MORE MONEY NEXT TIME
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00149	AND WITH MORE MONEY AT WILD ANIMAL INITIATIVE WE CAN HIRE MORE RESEARCHERS AND LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW WE CAN GIVE ANIMALS THE LIVES THEY PREFER
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00151	BE IMPATIENT FOR A BETTER FUTURE WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND WE MUST MAKE A DIFFERENCE OUR WORK IS NOT JUST IMPORTANT IT IS URGENT
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00152	THE MORE TIME AND ENERGY WE WASTE THE MORE ANIMALS WILL SUFFER THE SMARTER WE WORK THE QUICKER WE WILL FIND WAYS TO HELP ANIMALS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00154	REMIND EACH OTHER OF THIS AND MODEL THAT URGENCY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00156	CELEBRATE WIN
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00158	BIG AND SMALL MILESTONES MUST BE CELEBRATED NO COUNTLESS HANDS ROAMING IN A BARN WITHOUT SUNLIGHT LAYING EGGS WITHOUT EVER RAISING CHILDREN IS NOT GOOD
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00159	BUT A SWITCH TO THAT FROM TINY CAGES MEANS LESS PAIN IT MEANS MORE EXPENSIVE EGGS IT MEANS WE ARE A STEP CLOSER TO LIBERATION IT'S LIKE WE PASS A TEST ON THE WAY TO GRADUATION IT DESERVES REWARD
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00161	AND WHEN YOU CELEBRATE INDIVIDUAL ACHIEVEMENTS MAKE IT SPECIFIC DON'T YOU SAY UH A PARENT WORK DAY AND NIGHT TO CREATE A BEAUTIFUL VIDEO
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00163	EXPLAIN WHY THAT IS AN IMPORTANT STEP ON THE WAY TO ANIMAL LIBERATION INSTEAD YOU SAY THIS VIDEO SHE WORKED ON SO HARD WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR A MESSAGE TO SPREAD
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00164	FOR PEOPLE TO BE INSPIRED TO EAT BETTER FOOD THANKS TO OPARANUS WORK FEWER ANIMALS WILL BE KILLED FOR FOOD
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00166	NOT TO THE INPUT THE HEARTWORK BUT TO THE IMPACT SOMEONE MAKES
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00168	MAKE SURE YOU FEEL GOOD WHEN YOU DO GOOD HELP OTHERS FEEL SUCCESSFUL HELPING OTHERS FEEL SUCCESSFUL WILL LEAD THEM TO CONTINUE TO WANT TO DO THEIR CRITICAL WORK
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00170	VISUALIZE THE PEACEFUL WORLD WE WANT TO LIVE IN AND HOW WE ARE GETTING THERE TOGETHER
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00172	DEVELOP DEVELOP AND GROW OTHER LEADERS I'M NOT SURE ABOUT YOU UM THOUGH I THINK YOU DO TOO UM I WANT TO GROW I WANT TO BECOME A BETTER PERSON THAN I AM TODAY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00174	I WANT TO GET BETTER AT PROTECTING ANIMALS I CANNOT DO THAT ALONE I NEED TO LEARN FROM THE PEOPLE AROUND ME WHO HAVE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON THE IMPACT I MAKE AND WHO HAVE DIFFERENT KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00176	A LEADER ACTIVELY TAKES ON THE ROLE OF SUPPORTING PEOPLE TO BECOME THEIR BEST SELVES
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00177	BECAUSE NOT ONLY DOES THAT MEAN YOU GIVE SOMEONE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE BETTER IT MEANS THE ORGANIZATION WILL BE BETTER AT ACHIEVING ITS GOALS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00179	AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A MANAGER TO DO THIS WE EACH HAVE SOME INSIGHTS OR ABILITIES THAT OTHERS ON OUR TEAMS DO NOT IF YOU SHARE THOSE DEVELOP OTHERS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00181	GIVE FEEDBACK
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00183	POSITIVE FEEDBACK BEING EXPLICIT ABOUT HOW MY ACTION LED TO HELPING MORE ANIMALS IS AN INCREDIBLE MOTIVATOR
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00185	GIVING CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK GENUINELY AIMED AT HELPING ME BE BETTER THAT IS SPECIFIC AND TIMELY MAKES ME THINK YOU BELIEVE I HAVE GREATER POTENTIAL
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00187	THAT YOU TRUST ME ENOUGH TO HAVE CHALLENGING CONVERSATIONS FOR MANY THE BEST REWARD IS ATTENTION AND I FULLY BELIEVE IN POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT AND LEADING BY EXAMPLE
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00188	BUT IGNORING UNPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOR CAN MEAN ROBBING PEOPLE OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO GROW DENYING PEOPLE A CHANCE TO IMPROVE IN MY OPINION IS SHORTSIGHTED COWARDICE AND SELFISH
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00190	UH INDIVIDUALS WHO BELIEVE THEIR TALENTS CAN BE DEVELOPED THROUGH HARD WORK GOOD STRATEGIES AND INPUT FROM OTHERS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00192	THEY TEND TO ACHIEVE MORE THAN PEOPLE WITH A MORE FIXED MINDSET THOSE WHO BELIEVE THEIR TALENTS ARE INNATE GIFTS AND IF WE BELIEVE MAKING MISTAKES IS GOOD AS GURSTY WILL SHOW LATER TODAY THEN WE NEED FEEDBACK
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00194	SHARE YOUR KNOWLEDGE I NEED ACCESS TO KNOWLEDGE SO I DON'T WASTE TIME REINVENTING THE WHEEL WHEN YOU SHARE BOOKS ARTICLES STRATEGIES AND IDEAS WITH ME I FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE THE EXPECTATION I CAN
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00196	I ADMIT THAT IN THE PAST I I MIGHT NOT HAVE ALWAYS SHARED KNOWLEDGE SO THAT I COULD REMAIN THE SOLE EXPERT SO THAT I COULD FEEL NECESSARY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00197	BUT THE FEAR OF BECOMING OBSOLETE IS ONE YOU MUST OVERCOME LEADER SHARE KNOWLEDGE THEY DON'T HIDE IT
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00199	THEY SUCCEED WHEN THEY HELP PEOPLE BECOME BETTER THAN THEY ARE
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00201	MODEL GOOD BEHAVIOR WHEN I SEE SOMEONE SUCCESSFULLY COACH OTHERS COMMUNICATE BAD NEWS TRANSPARENTLY AND WITH COMPASSION OR ASK FOR COMMENTS AND DEAL WITH CRITICAL FEEDBACK WELL I HAVE EXAMPLES TO COPY FROM
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00203	BE AWARE OF HOW YOUR ATTITUDE AND ACTIONS INFLUENCE OTHERS PERCEPTIONS OF WHAT IS ACCEPTABLE AND GOOD
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00205	SHARESPACE
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00207	INVITE PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE IT DOESN'T COME NATURAL TO EVERYONE TO SPEAK UP OR TO STEP INTO NEW SITUATIONS BUT TESTING NEW THINGS IS IMPORTANT FOR MY GROWTH
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00208	WHEN I AM PUT IN STRETCH OPPORTUNITIES AND WHEN I AM INVITED TO TAKE UP SPACE THAT BECOMES EASIER
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00210	IF THERE ARE PEOPLE ON YOUR TEAM WHO YOU KNOW ARE CAPABLE OF MORE THAN THEY HAVE SHOWN OR WHO MIGHT HAVE GOOD IDEAS BUT DON'T USUALLY SPEAK UP YOU CAN CREATE OPENINGS FOR THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CONVERSATION
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00211	YOU CAN HELP PEOPLE GET OVER THEIR INSECURITY TO GET OVER THAT THRESHOLD OF SPEAKING UP
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00213	SAY HEY SARA DIDN'T YOU HAVE A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE WITH X WHAT IS YOUR PERSPECTIVE OR EVAN I HAVE ONLY HEARD FROM THE USUALS BUT WHAT ARE THE QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ON THIS TOPIC
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00215	OUR SUCCESS IS HIGHLY INDEPENDENT ON THAT OF OTHERS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00217	CONNECT CONNECT TO CREATE A SUPPORTIVE COLLECTION COLLECTIVE RIGHT YOUR WORK CAN BE EMOTIONALLY TAXING THE CRUCTY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00219	AND SUFFERING OF ANIMALS SEEMS ENDLESS OUR ACHIEVEMENTS ARE INCREMENTAL
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00221	WE NEED SUPPORT TO CONTINUE TO DO THIS WORK MOREOVER IT IS CRITICAL TO PROVIDE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY WHERE PEOPLE CAN OPENLY TALK ABOUT THE THINGS THAT WENT WRONG AND MIGHT GO WRONG
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00222	IF YOU WEREN'T THERE ON FRIDAY I RECOMMEND YOU WATCH ANNE'S TALK WHO SPOKE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT CREATING PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00224	PEOPLE WON'T SHARE IDEAS IF THEY DO NOT FEEL THEY BELONG
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00226	CREATE A COLLECTIVE OF ALLIES AND HERE I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO DISAGREE A TINY BIT WITH ANNA AND CHRISTINA WHO SPOKE ON FRIDAY I DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO BE FRIENDS WITH THE PEOPLE YOU WORK WITH
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00228	WE ARE LESS LIKE A FAMILY AND MORE LIKE A SPORTS TEAM WITH A COMMON GOAL FRINGE GROUPS CAN FEEL LIKE CLICKS WITH OUTSIDERS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00230	I THINK WE NEED ALLIES PEOPLE YOU CAN DEPEND ON TO HELP YOU DO YOUR BEST WORK WHO YOU HOLD ACCOUNTABLE AND WHO HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE YOU HAVE THE MOST IMPORTANT CONNECTION WITH YOUR COLLEAGUES YOU ALL WANT TO HELP ANIMALS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00232	I DON'T WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO ME BECAUSE WE HAVE THE SAME CULTURAL BACKGROUND BUT BECAUSE I HAVE A GOOD IDEA AND I NEED YOU TO BE CRITICAL OF MY SUGGESTIONS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00233	AND YOUR OPINION OF THEM SHOULD NOT BE COLORED BY A MUTUAL LOVE FOR UM THE MUSIC OF JOY DIVISION
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00235	WE NEED TO TRUST THAT WHEN WE DISAGREE WE DO SO BECAUSE WE WANT TO GET TO A POINT OF BETTER UNDERSTANDING HOW WE CAN IMPROVE LIVES WE NEED RELATIONSHIPS WE CAN COUNT ON
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00237	TO FORM A COLLECTIVE A NETWORK OF ALLIES BUILD ONE ON ONE RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY SUPPORT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN OTHER PEOPLE MAKE INTRODUCTIONS BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO COULD SUPPORT EACH OTHER OR LEARN FROM EACH OTHER
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00239	CHECK IN PEOPLE DO THEIR BEST WORK WHEN THEY FEEL A SENSE OF BELONGING
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00241	TO CREATE THAT INCLUSION FOR MANY THAT MEANS THEY NEED PEOPLE TO CHECK IN WITH THEM ESPECIALLY IN TIMES OF CRISIS IF YOU ARE A QUEER ADVOCATE IN POLAND RIGHT NOW YOUR IDENTITY YOUR EXISTENCE IS BASICALLY THREATENED
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00242	DOING YOUR WORK NOW IS EVEN HARDER THAN NORMAL SHOW EACH OTHER COMPASSION
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00244	BE KIND AND SUPPORTIVE SEE HOW OTHER PEOPLE ARE DOING AND NOT JUST THE ONES YOU NATURALLY GRAVITATE TOWARDS REMEMBER THAT YOU HAVE WHAT YOU HAVE IN COMMON AND SHOW UP FOR EACH OTHER
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00246	SPEAK UP FOR EACH OTHER IN TWO WAYS FIRST AMPLIFY VOICES ESPECIALLY MARGINALIZED ONES IF SOMEONE ISN'T LISTENED TO BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT INCLUDED OR BECAUSE THEY AREN'T AS LOUD OR AS RESPECTED
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00247	YOU CAN REPEAT THEIR POINTS AND ATTRIBUTE THEIR IDEAS TO THEM THIS WILL MAKE THEM FEEL HEARD AND PART OF THE TEAM AND BETTER DECISIONS CAN BE MADE
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00249	THEN SPEAK UP FOR EACH OTHER CALL THEM BAD BEHAVIOR WHEN SOMEONE USES DISRESPECTFUL LANGUAGE OR SHOWS THEIR BIAS ASK WHAT THEY MEAN OR EXPLAIN WHY IT CAN FEEL HARMFUL
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00250	IF YOU DON'T YOU GIVE YOUR SILENT APPROVAL AND ENCOURAGE AN ENVIRONMENT OF HARASSMENT
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00252	YOU CAN HELP CREATE A BRAVE SPACE OF BELONGING WHERE ONLY PEOPLE'S IDEAS ARE JUDGED NOT THEIR IDENTITY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00254	WHEN I KNOW YOU HAVE MY BACK IT WILL BE EASIER FOR ME TO SPEAK UP FOR MYSELF AND FOR OTHERS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00256	IF PEOPLE FEEL THEY ARE HAPPY IN THEIR PLACE OF WORK TURNOVER IS LOW AND MORE PEOPLE WANT TO JOIN YOUR GROUP
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00258	AND YOU'LL DELIVER BETTER WORK AS A COLLECTIVE THAN YOU DO AS A COLLECTION OF INDIVIDUALS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00260	SO ALL THESE FOUR THINGS ARE CONNECTED EACH OF THE COMPETENCIES SUPPORT AND REINFORCE EACH OTHER
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00262	WITHOUT ASKING QUESTIONS WITHOUT FULLY UNDERSTANDING WHY OUR METHODS ARE THE BEST AND HOW MUNDANE TASKS RELATE TO THE MISSION IT IS HARD TO INSPIRE EACH OTHER ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CHANGE THE WORLD
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00263	AND WITHOUT INSPIRATION WITHOUT BELIEVING YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE WHAT INTEREST DO I HAVE TO DEVELOP AND GROW
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00265	AND IF YOU DO NOT DEVELOP IF YOU HOARD YOUR KNOWLEDGE AND DON'T INVITE PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE THEY WILL BE LESS LIKELY TO FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE A PART THAT THEY ARE A PART OF A CONNECTED COLLECTIVE
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00267	AND WITHOUT PEOPLE FEELING LIKE THEY ARE CONNECTED AND VALUED LIKE THEY ARE JUDGED ON THE VALIDITY OF THEIR IDEAS AND NOT THEIR CHARACTER THEY WON'T FEEL FREE TO QUESTION THE STRATEGY THAT THE ORGANIZATION IS TAKING
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00269	THERE ARE FOUR SKILLS LISTED IN THE CENTER CIRCLE COMMUNICATION CRITICAL THINKING FEEDBACK AND DEI STANDS FOR DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00271	LEARNING ABOUT AND PRACTICING THESE CORE SKILLS WELL HELP YOU GET BETTER AT ACTING ON THE FOUR LEADERSHIP COMPETENCIES AROUND IT EACH OF THESE FOUR SKILLS DESERVED THEIR OWN FULL TASK IF NOT FULL DAY MULTI SESSIONS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00272	SO I CAN'T GO OVER ALL OF THEM HERE
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00274	BUT I DO WANT TO GO OVER DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION BRIEFLY BECAUSE I THINK IT'S ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR OUR MOVEMENT NOW WE MUST CARE ABOUT HUMANS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00276	RESEARCH HAS SHOWN WE WON'T BE AS EFFECTIVE AS ORGANIZATIONS AND AS A MOVEMENT WITHOUT REPRESENTATION ON OUR TEAMS OF THE DIVERSITY OF PEOPLE
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00277	WITHOUT PEOPLE FEELING LIKE THEY BELONG AND WITHOUT EVERYONE BEING EQUALLY LIKELY TO ACHIEVE SUCCESS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00279	SO DIVERSITY TO MEANS UM PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT IDENTITIES AND WAYS OF THINKING ARE REPRESENTED IN EQUITY PEOPLE HAVE WHAT THEY NEED TO THRIVE INCLUSION PEOPLE ARE HEARD AND FEEL LIKE THEY BELONG
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00281	I ALSO BELIEVE THAT IT IS NOT JUST IMPORTANT FOR US TO UM TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN OUR ANIMAL ADVOCACY I THINK IT IS OUR MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO CREATE EQUITY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00282	IF WE ARE EMPATHETIC TO INJUSTICE AND DON'T STAND UP FOR PEOPLE WHO MIGHT NOT BE IN THE ROOM WE CONSENT TO THE STATUS QUO OF OPPRESSION
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00284	THERE ARE MANY FORMS OF EXCLUSION PLAGUING OUR MOVEMENT SEXISM ABOLISM HETERONORMATIVITY BUT I WANT TO CALL OUT IN PARTICULAR ANTI RACISM IN OUR WORK
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00285	I RECOMMEND YOU SEEK OUT AND COMPASS MOVEMENT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW TO CREATE RACIAL JUSTICE IN THE ANIMAL ADVOCACY SPACE
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00287	I'LL ALSO WANT TO SHOW YOU HOW I THINK UH DEI THESE THREE CONCEPTS ARE IMPORTANT FOR THE FOUR COMPETENCIES I DISCUSSED
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00289	QUESTIONING
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00290	NUMEROUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT DIVERSITY ON YOUR TEAMS CAN CREATE A WORK CULTURE THAT IS BETTER AT MAKING MORE INFORMED DECISIONS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00292	BECAUSE WHEN YOU ARE ALL FRIENDS OR LIKE MINDED PEOPLE IT IS VERY EASY TO GET ON THE SAME SMOOTH WAVE LENGTH AND PRODUCE IDEAS YOU EACH BELIEVE IN
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00294	BUT IT ALSO MEANS YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO MISS OUT ON CERTAIN THOUGHTS ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN YOUR TEAM CONSISTS OF PEOPLE WITH VERY DIFFERENT LIFE EXPERIENCE OR DIFFERENT THINKING PATTERNS DECIDING ON STRATEGY MIGHT FEEL A BIT MORE LIKE A STRUGGLE
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00295	BUT IDEAS ARE CONSIDERED FROM MORE ANGLES
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00297	ENCOURAGING DIVERSITY BOTH COGNITIVE AND IDENTITY BASED WILL ENCOURAGE MORE QUESTIONS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00299	THEN INSPIRE
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00301	WE NEED TO INSPIRE EVERYONE ON OUR TEAMS TO DELIVER OUR BEST WORK IT WILL BE VERY HARD TO MOTIVATE PEOPLE THAT WE CAN FIGHT THIS MASSIVE BATTLE TOGETHER IF SOME ARE EXCLUDED AND FEEL LIKE THEY DO NOT BELONG
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00303	DEVELOP
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00305	PEOPLE OF COLOR AND OTHER MARGINALIZED PERSONS ARE OFTEN LESS LIKELY TO SUCCEED BECAUSE THEY HAVE LESS ACCESS TO LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES AND MENTORSHIP WHILE AT THE SAME TIME THEY ARE FORCED TO LIVE UP TO HIGHER STANDARDS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00307	CONNECTING AS A TEAM MEMBER YOU CAN HELP CREATE A SENSE OF INCLUSION AND WITHOUT INCLUSION PEOPLE WILL NOT FEEL FREE TO SHARE THEIR IDEAS NOR WILL PEOPLE BE OPEN TO LISTENING TO YOURS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00308	LEARN TO RECOGNIZE THE WAY BUIS INFLUENCES BEHAVIOR AND HOW IT SEEPS INTO ORGANIZATIONAL SYSTEMS SO YOU CAN CHANGE THEM
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00310	QUESTION YOURSELF AND LISTEN TO COWORKERS AND PEOPLE OUTSIDE YOUR COMMUNITY WITH AN OPEN MIND
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00312	THIS WILL HELP YOU INCORPORATE ANTI OPPRESSION IN YOUR LEADERSHIP
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00314	WITHOUT IT WE ARE LESS EFFECTIVE WITHOUT IT WE WON'T HAVE JUSTICE WE ARE ALL ANIMALS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00316	IN SUMMARY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00318	YOU CAN MAKE AN IMPACT ON YOUR COWORKERS OR END YOUR ORGANIZATION AND YOUR MISSION IRRESPECTIVE OF YOUR AUTHORITY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00320	QUESTION HOW PEOPLE AND PLANS IN YOUR ORGANIZATION LEAD TO BETTER LIVES FOR ANIMALS ASK CRITICAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DIRECTION OF YOUR ORGANIZATION
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00322	INSPIRE THE PEOPLE YOU WORK WITH SHOW THEM THE DIFFERENCE YOUR HEART WORK TOGETHER MAKES FOR ANIMALS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00324	DEVELOP OTHERS ABILITY TO MAKE IMPACT SUPPORT THEM IN THEIR GROWTH AND CONNECT BUILD RELATIONSHIPS AND MAKE SURE INDIVIDUALS FEEL LIKE THEY BELONG
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00326	SO
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00328	THAT IS THE MAJORITY OF ALL I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU TODAY SO WHAT'S LEFT IS SOME QUESTIONS I HAVE FOR YOU HOPING THAT WE CAN ALL LEARN FROM EACH OTHER'S EXPERIENCE
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00329	FEEL FREE TO TYPE IN THE CHAT BOX OR TO IMMEDIATE YOURSELF TO SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS AND I HAVE THREE QUESTIONS FOR YOU AND ONCE WE HAVE GONE THROUGH THEM
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00330	THERE SHOULD BE TIME FOR YOUR SLIDE OUT QUESTIONS SO WHICH ONE OF MY IDEAS WILL YOU TRY OUT
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00332	AND I'M GOING TO REMAIN UNCOMFORTABLY QUIET UNTIL SOMEONE SPEAKS UP OR CHATS UP BIANCA OR MONICA IF YOU'RE STILL HERE COULD YOU HELP ME READ THE IF THERE'S ANY CHATS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00334	OKAY EVERYONE SO UH I JUST WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU UH AS STEIN HAS SAID BEFORE TO ANSWER UM HER QUESTIONS IN THE CHAT OR IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS YOU CAN UH ASK THROUGH SLIDE
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00336	AND LOCASSES VOICING CONCERNS OR QUESTIONS EVEN MORE ACTIVELY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00338	SOPHIA SAYS OR IT WILL WRITE IN THE CHAT REPEATING QUIET PEOPLE'S IDEAS AND ATTRIBUTING THEM TO THAT PERSON
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00340	UH CELEBRATE SMALL VICTORIES FOR THE ANIMALS MORE
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00342	WE NEED TO SUPPORT OTHER PEOPLE'S GROWTH
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00344	HE'S GOING TO TRY CELEBRATING SMALL MILE MILESTONES AND GIVING PEOPLE FEEDBACK
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00346	SO UM I'M SURE YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS OKAY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00348	THEN A NEXT QUESTION WHICH FOR ONE OF MY IDEAS WILL BE CHALLENGED FOR YOU OR MAYBE WHAT ARE SOME IDEAS THAT YOU DON'T AGREE WITH
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00350	THAT YOU THINK I SHOULD CHANGE MY MIND ABOUT
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00352	I DON'T SEE ANYONE THAT WOULD WRITE SOMETHING RIGHT NOW IN THE GROUP CHAT BUT MAYBE IT'S NOT THAT CHALLENGING
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00353	YEAH
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00355	MAYBE FOR EXAMPLE FOR A ME A LOT OF THE MOST CHALLENGING THINGS ARE FOR SOME PREVENT THE BURN OUT AND
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00357	WELL DOING MOST OF THESE THINGS AND ENGAGE EVERY DAY OKAY AND WE HAVE THE FOR GIVEN MORE FROM METALLY GIVEN MORE FEEDBACK IS CHALLENGING BUT VERY IMPORTANT
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00359	THEN FROM THOMAS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00361	I THINK YOU CAN BE TOO ANNOYING IT CAN SLOW A PROCESS IF EVERYONE IS CRITICAL OF EVERYTHING ALL THE TIME
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00363	THEN MARIANA
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00365	EXACTLY BACK IS DEFINITELY THE MOST CHALLENGING
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00367	I HAVE TO AGREE WITH THAT I THINK FOR ME ALSO UM BOTH GIVING AND RECEIVING FEEDBACK UH IS IS DIFFICULT AND THERE IS A LOT TO LEARN FOR THAT
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00369	AND THEN UH LAST QUESTION SOMETHING THAT IN UH THE QUESTION ARE OR I THINK THE SURVEY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00370	THAT ANIMAL ADVOCACY CAREERS DID A LOT OF C E O'S AND LEADER SET THAT COMMUNICATION IS A SUPER IMPORTANT MANAGEMENT SKILL OR A LEADERSHIP SKILL
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00371	FOR THAT CAN MEAN A MILLION THINGS FROM LIKE BEING GOOD AT SPEAKING EXTERNALLY OR DELIVERING NICE PRESENTATIONS BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO YOU TO COMMUNICATE WELL AS A LEADER
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00373	OKAY SO AGAIN WE HAVE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS FROM TANYA GOOD COMMUNICATION ALL COMES DOWN TO LISTENING
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00374	AND THEN FROM ESHITA I I DIDN'T KNOW IF I PRONOUNCED THE NAME RIGHT BUT I HOPE SO UH NOT JUST HEARING BUT ALSO UNDERSTANDING WHAT SOMEONE HAS TO SAY
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00375	THEN FROM MICAH POSITIONING YOURSELF AT THE SAME LEVEL AS OTHERS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00377	HAVE A REALLY CLEAR PURPOSE BEING ABLE TO EXPLAIN WHY WE ARE DOING CERTAIN THINGS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00379	AND FROM LINA THAT THERE ARE NO MISUNDERSTANDINGS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00381	I THINK THOSE ARE ALL VERY GREAT POINTS
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00382	YEAH I THINK SO TOO
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00384	THOSE WERE ALL THE QUESTIONS I HAVE FOR YOU AND BESIDES ALL THE BOOKS I HAVE READ AND THE MANY MORE I STILL WANT TO READ
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00385	UM I THINK UH ANNIE AGAIN SORRY I KEEP CALLING YOU OUT IF YOU'RE HERE UM YOU ALSO HAD SOME GREAT BOOK RECOMMENDATIONS AND I THINK MANY OTHERS DO TOO
YTB+--tMoLpQI-w+00386	AND THESE ARE SOME OTHER SOURCES THAT I HAVE MENTIONED OR THAT YOU CAN FIND ONLINE TO READ MORE ABOUT LEADERSHIP PRACTICES AND ESPECIALLY DON'T FORGET YOUR COWORKERS
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00002	I'M PETER SYNDEN CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER AT GENOMICS ENGLAND AND TODAY I'M HERE TO DISCUSS HOW RESEARCH IS BEING USED TO DELIVER PERSONALIZED CARE
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00004	GENOMICS IS A GROUNDBREAKING AREA OF MEDICINE IT USES A PERSON'S UNIQUE GENETIC CODE TO HELP DIAGNOSE TREAT AND PREVENT ILLNESS
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00005	ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY NOW LET'S SCIENTISTS COMPARE GENETIC CODE ACROSS THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TO MAKE NEW DISCOVERIES AND CONTINUALLY IMPROVE IMPROVE HEALTH CARE
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00007	JESSICA IS A FOUR YEAR OLD GIRL SHE HAS A RARE GENETIC CONDITION THAT CAUSES EPILEPSY AND AFFECTS HER MOVEMENT AND GENERAL DEVELOPMENT
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00008	THROUGHOUT THE EARLY YEARS OF HER LIFE SHE'S BEEN GIVEN MRI'S LUMBER PUNCHES EG'S TO MEASURE BRAIN WAVES AND MANY OTHER DIAGNOSTICS NONE OF WHICH REVEALED HER PARTICULAR CONDITION
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00010	THROUGH A HUNDRED THOUSAND GENOME PROJECT JESSICA RECEIVED A DIAGNOSIS GENOMICS PINPOINTED A CHANGE TO ONE OF HER GENES THAT WAS NOT PRESENT IN EITHER OF HER PARENTS THEY NOW KNOW THAT JESSICA HAS GLUT1 ONE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00011	SHE DOESN'T PRODUCE ENOUGH OF THE PROTEIN THAT TRANSPORTS GLUCOSE FROM THE BLOOD TO THE FLUID AROUND THE BRAIN
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00013	BUT JESSICA CAN NOW CONTROL HER EPILEPSY BY ADOPTING A SPECIAL KETOGENIC DIET LOW IN CARBOHYDRATES AND HIGH PROTEIN
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00014	THIS UNDERSTANDING DIRECTLY IMPROVED THE LIFE OF A CHILD AND APPLYING THE PROCESS AT SCALE CAN IMPROVE THE LIVES OF MANY CHILDREN AND ADULTS ALIKE
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00016	FURTHERMORE THE PARENTS NOW KNOW THAT THE CONDITION WAS NOT INHERITED IF THEY DECIDE TO HAVE MORE CHILDREN THEY WILL NOT HAVE THE SAME CONDITION ESSENTIAL FOR THEIR PEACE OF MIND
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00018	RARE DISEASE IS VERY COMMON
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00020	WELL EACH DISEASE IS INDIVIDUALLY RARE THERE ARE OVER SEVEN THOUSAND RARE DISEASES
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00022	COLLECTIVELY ONE OF ONE OF SEVENTEEN PEOPLE HAS A RARE DISEASE AND THAT REPRESENTS OVER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE GLOBALLY
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00024	EIGHTY PERCENT OF RARE DISEASES HAVE A GENETIC CAUSE PATIENTS WILL WAIT ON AVERAGE FOUR YEARS FOR DIAGNOSIS AND NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THEM WILL HAVE NO APPROVED TREATMENT
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00026	THIS IS AN AREA OF MEDICINE WITH A SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL FOR ADVANCING SCIENCE AND IMPROVING LIVES THIS IS WHY RARE DISEASE WAS A MAJOR FOCUS OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND GENOME PROJECT FOR WHICH GENOMICS ENGLAND WAS ORIGINALLY ESTABLISHED
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00028	INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH TO FURTHER UNDERSTAND AND TREAT THESE CONDITIONS IS CRITICAL AND HIGH IMPACT GENOMICS IN ENABLING GENOMICS CLINICALLY ACCESSIBLE
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00029	WE WORK ALONGSIDE FRIENDS IN THE UK MEDICAL FAMILY FROM NHS ENGLAND TO BUYER BANK HDR UK AND NIHR
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00030	OUR SYSTEMS ARE USED BY SEVERAL THOUSAND ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS BY BIO TECH AND BY PHARMA
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00032	WE HAVE DEEP TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC SPECIALISTS PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE LIKES OF AWS LIFEBIT ALUMINA CONGENICA INVIDIA AND OXFORD MANIPAL
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00034	WE EXIST IN PART THROUGH CENTRAL GOVERNMENT FUNDING AND IN PART THROUGH RESEARCH FUNDING
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00036	ENGLAND IS A KEY FACILITATOR IN THE TRANSITION TO PERSONALIZED PREDICTIVE AND PREVENTATIVE GENOMIC HEALTH CARE
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00038	WE WORK WITH THE NHS TO DELIVER AND IMPROVE GENOMIC TESTING THAT HELPS DOCTORS DIAGNOSE TREAT AND PREVENT ILLNESS STARTING WITH CANCER AND RARE DISEASE
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00039	A MINIMUM OF TWENTY THOUSAND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCES ARE EXPECTED TO BE PROCESSED DURING TWENTY TWENTY ONE
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00041	AT THE SAME TIME WE PROVIDE HEALTH DATA AND ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY NEEDED BY RESEARCHERS TO MAKE NEW MEDICAL DISCOVERIES AND DEVELOP MORE EFFECTIVE TARGETED MEDICINES FOR PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00043	TOGETHER THESE TWO HALVES OF THE INFINITY LOOP REINFORCE EACH OTHER ADVANCES IN RESEARCH CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO CLINICAL CARE
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00045	PATIENTS RECEIVING CLINICAL CARE CAN CONSENT TO BE INCLUDED IN RESEARCH DATA TO SUPPORT MEDICAL ADVANCES IN DOING THIS WE CREATE A VIRTUOUS CIRCLE
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00047	THIS SLIDE SHOWS THAT GENOMICS DOESN'T JUST APPLY TO RARE DISEASE THIS SLIDE RELATES TO CANCER
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00049	IN THIS INSTANCE AN INDIVIDUAL PRESENTED WITH A BRAIN TUMOR BUT THE CLINICIAN SUSPECTED THE BRAIN TUMOR WAS NOT THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF THE CANCER AND BY ANALYZING TUMOR MUTATION BURDEN WHICH IS A MEASURE OF THE MUTATIONS IN THE D AND A OF THE CANCER CELLS
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00050	IT WAS POSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY THAT THE PRIMARY SOURCE WAS LIKELY COLORECTAL LUNG OR MALIGNANT MELANOMA
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00052	BY FURTHER ANALYZING TRANSVERSIONS A PROCESS WHEREBY C BASES ARE CHANGED TO A BASES IN THE GENOMIC CODE IT WAS POSSIBLE TO SHOW THAT THE LIKELY CAUSE WAS DNA DAMAGE FROM INHALING BENZOPYRINE BENZOPYRINE IS A CARCINOGEN PREVALENT IN CIGARETTE SMOKE
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00054	BY USING THESE TWO TECHNIQUES TOGETHER THE PRIMARY DISEASE TYPE WAS IDENTIFIED AS LUNG CANCER AND IN THIS INSTANCE WAS TREATABLE WITH A MUTATION THERAPY STIMULATING THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO KILL THE CANCER CELLS
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00057	THROUGH THE HUNDRED THOUSAND GENOME PROJECT OVER ONE HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND GENOMES HAVE BEEN CONTRIBUTED BY APPROXIMATELY NINETY THOUSAND PARTICIPANTS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00058	OVER SEVENTY THOUSAND OF THOSE RELATE TO RARE DISEASE FROM THE INDIVIDUALS AFFECTIVE AND IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES FROM THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00059	OVER SEVENTEEN THOUSAND CANCER PATIENTS HAVE CONTRIBUTED BOTH GERMLINE AND TUMOR SEQUENCES OVER THE LAST YEAR INDIVIDUALS HAVE ALSO CONTRIBUTED GENOMES TO HELP UNDERSTAND COVID NINETEEN AND THE VARIATION IN SEVERITY OF THE DISEASE
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00060	THIS IS BUILDING TO AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND GENOMES
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00062	THE GENOMIC DATA SITS ALONGSIDE CLINICALLY RELEVANT DATA TO PROVIDE A RICH PHENOTYPIC GENOTYPIC ENVIRONMENT FOR DETAILED ANALYSIS
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00063	CLINICAL DATA INCLUDES HOSPITAL EPISODE STATISTICS MORTALITY DATA A RANGE OF CANCER SPECIFIC INFORMATION AND EXIT QUESTIONNAIRE FROM CLINICIANS CLINICIANS INDICATING FOR EXAMPLE WHETHER THE SPECIFIC VARIANTS COULD EXPLAIN THE PHENOTYPE
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00065	IN SOME INSTANCES IMAGING AND PRIMARY CARE DATA ARE ALSO LINKED
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00067	THIS SLIDE SHOWS THE SPREAD OF GENE NAMES BETWEEN RARE DISEASE TYPES THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS RELATING TO NEUROLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT DISORDERS ALONG WITH MANY OTHER CLASSES OF DISEASE
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00069	WHEN LOGGED INTO OUR RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT THESE CAN BE EXPLORED AND SEGMENTED IN MANY WAYS TO FIND THE RIGHT COHORT OF PARTICIPANTS FOR YOUR PARTICULAR STUDY
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00071	AND THIS SLIDE SHOWS THE SPREAD OF PARTICIPANTS BY CANCER TYPE AS EXPECTED YOU SEE GREATER NUMBERS OF THE MORE PREVALENT BREAST COLORECTAL AND LUNG CANCER PATIENTS CANCER PATIENTS COVER BOTH SEMATIC MUTATIONS THOSE THAT OCCUR FROM DAMAGE TO GENES
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00072	IN AN INDIVIDUAL DURING THE PERSON'S LIFE AND GERMLINE MUTATIONS THOSE THAT ARE PASSED ON DIRECTLY FROM A PARENT TO A CHILD AT THE TIME OF CONCEPTION
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00074	FOLLOWING THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND GENOMIC PROJECT GENOMICS ENGLAND HAS UNDERGONE A TRANSFORMATION FROM PROJECT TO PLATFORM OUR NEXT CHAPTER INVOLVES WORKING WITH PATIENTS DOCTORS AND SCIENTISTS TO IMPROVE THE GENOMIC TESTING IN THE NHS
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00075	AND HELP RESEARCHERS ACCESS THE HEALTH DATA AND TECHNOLOGY THEY NEED TO MAKE NEW MEDICAL DISCOVERIES AND CREATE MORE EFFECTIVE TARGETED MEDICINES FOR EVERYBODY
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00077	THE MORE GENOMES ARE ANALYZED THE MORE DISCOVERIES CAN BE MADE AND THE BETTER FUTURE CARE WILL BE OUR TRANSITION FROM SELF MANAGED INFRASTRUCTURE TO AWS CLOUD IS AN ESSENTIAL ENABLER IN SCALING OUR OFFERING TO ENABLE SUCH RESEARCH
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00079	RESEARCHERS CAN ACCESS THE GENOMIC AND CLINICAL DATA OUTLINED ABOVE BY USING GENOMIC ENGLAND'S TRUSTED RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT JAIL HAS PARTNERED WITH INNOVATIVE BRITISH DEEP TECH COMPANY LIFEBIT AND IS USING GLOBAL CLOUD PROVIDER AWS TO POWER THE PLATFORM
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00080	THE PLATFORM PROVIDES IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO TOOLING REQUIRED TO DEFINE AND EXPLORE A COHORT OF INDIVIDUALS BASED ON GENOMIC GENOMIC OR PHENOTYPIC STRATIFICATION
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00081	THE PLATFORM ENABLES DATA EXPLORATION AND MAKES IT SIMPLE FOR RESEARCHERS TO EXECUTE PIPELINES AND OTHER JOBS
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00083	RESEARCHERS CAN INTRODUCE CUTTING EDGE ANALYTICAL TOOLS OF THEIR CHOICE THROUGH DOCKER CONTAINERS LINK THOSE TOOLS SECURELY WITH THEIR OWN DATA
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00084	AND CONDUCT RESEARCH ACROSS ALL DATA SOURCES IN PRIVATE WORKSPACES THAT ARE AUDITED PROTECTED AND CONTROLLED BY JIRA STRICT INFORMATION GOVERNANCE POLICIES
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00086	BUT WHY USE RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00088	IN ADDITION TO PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY THERE ARE FOUR KEY REASONS TO USE THE TRUSTED RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT FIRSTLY THE DATA SETS INVOLVED ARE ENORMOUS
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00089	THE DATA IS TOO BIG TO MOVE EFFICIENTLY IT CANNOT READILY BE ACHIEVED WITH A SENSIBLE TIME FRAME OR COST AS THE DATA GROWS THIS BECOMES AN EVER INCREASING CONSTRAINT
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00090	BY WAY OF EXAMPLE WHEN GENOMICS ENGLAND MOVED ITS OWN DATA FROM ONE STORAGE SYSTEM TO ANOTHER IT TOOK NINE MONTHS FOR THE FULL COPY
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00092	SECONDLY TECHNOLOGY NOW MAKES IT RELATIVELY SIMPLE TO BRING THE ANALYTICS TO THE DATA INCREASING SPEED AND LOWERING COST THIS IS BECOMING A COMMON PARADIGM FOR DISTRIBUTED ANALYSIS OF VERY LARGE DATA SETS
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00094	THROUGH LIFE BITS CLOUD OS EACH RESEARCHER RECEIVES THEIR OWN CLEAN ROOM ENVIRONMENT SEPARATE TO ANY OTHER FROM WHICH THEY CAN ACCESS ALL OF THE GENOMICS INDOORS DATA ALONGSIDE THEIR OWN DATA
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00095	THE FULLY MANAGED SERVICE PROVIDES MAXIMUM UTILITY WITHOUT SACRIFICING SECURITY OR CONTROL
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00097	THIRDLY INVESTING IN HARDWARE AND ESTABLISHING AN ENVIRONMENT IS A DRAG ON INNOVATION IT'S NOT A GOOD USE OF TIME FOR DATA SCIENTISTS OR BIOMETHAMATICIANS
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00099	AND LASTLY THE COMMON ENVIRONMENT ENABLES READY COLLABORATION BETWEEN RESEARCH TEAMS WHILE EACH HAS THEIR OWN ENVIRONMENT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO COLLABORATE WHEREVER THEY WISH
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00101	CLOUD BRINGS SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES TO RESEARCH
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00103	YOU CAN BEGIN RAPIDLY WITH NO NEED TO PURCHASE INSTALL OR MANAGE HARDWARE BY PIGGYBACKING OR AN ESTABLISHED RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT YOU CAN SCALE RESEARCH IMMEDIATELY WITH ALL SECURITY IDENTITY MANAGEMENT AND DATA INGESTION READILY AND READY AND WAITING
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00105	A WELL GOVERNED CLOUD PLATFORM IS MORE SECURE THAN SELF MANAGED INFRASTRUCTURE
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00106	A PAY AS YOU GO MODEL MEANS YOU ONLY NEED TO PAY FOR WHAT YOU USE
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00107	FEDERATION OF DATA BECOMES SIMPLER INTEGRATING DATA SECURELY FEDERATION ACROSS ENVIRONMENTS IS A CRITICAL DIRECTION OF TRAVEL AND WE FULLY SUPPORT THE EFFORTS OF THE G FOR GH COMMUNITY
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00109	THE CLOUD PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT ELEVEN NINES RESILIENCE THIS ALLOWS US TO DEFEAT MORE EFFORT INTO ENABLING GEOMETRIC RESEARCH OVER MANAGING PLATFORM STABILITY
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00111	AND IN A WORLD WHERE GENOMICS IS AT THE BLEEDING EDGE OF HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTE WE CAN ALWAYS BENEFIT FROM THE LATEST AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY WITHOUT BEING CONCERNED WITH CAPITAL INVESTMENT AND DEPRECIATION LIFE CYCLES
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00113	WHILE THE BENEFITS OF CLOUD ARE UNDENIABLE THERE'S A JOURNEY TO SETTING UP A HIGH FUNCTIONING ANALYTICS PLATFORM GENOMICS ENGLAND WE'VE MADE THE INVESTMENT SO THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00114	SOME CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE HAD THAT WE HAVE ADDRESSED ARE SUCH
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00116	HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING IS A SPECIALIZED END TO END COMPUTING WITH THE HELP OF INTEL AND AWS WE TACKLED THE PERFORMANCE AND CONFIGURATION QUESTIONS HEAD ON
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00118	AND INTEL SUPPORT ENABLED US TO EMBED ARCHITECTURAL CHANGES FROM WHICH ALL USERS NOW BENEFIT
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00120	WE LOOKED AT SEVERAL CLASSES OF COMMON JOBS A SIMPLE G AWS A STANDARD GENOMIC FUNCTION SAW A FIVEFOLD IMPROVEMENT IN SPEED AND A TENFOLD REDUCTION IN COST
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00122	ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BOX CONFIGURATION A COMPLEX BUT FREQUENT JOB TOOK TWENTY FIVE HOURS TO RUN
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00123	AFTER OUR INVESTMENT WE WERE ABLE TO REDUCE THE COMPUTE TIME FROM TWENTY FIVE HOURS TO TWENTY THREE SECONDS THIS IS A GENERIC IMPROVEMENT FOR ALL SUCH WORKLOADS
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00125	THIS INVESTMENT THAT WE PUT IN ALONGSIDE OUR PARTNERS MATTERS FOR ALL FUTURE RESEARCH AND COST OF RESEARCH ARE BASED ON INSTANCE TYPE SELECTED AND COMPUTE TIME USED
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00127	MIGRATING EXISTING SERVICES IS A NON TRIVIAL MATTER THROUGH OUR CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH AWS MIGRATION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WE'VE PLANNED TO MOVE OF COMPLEX INTERDEPENDENT SERVICES RUNNING OVER NEARLY ONE THOUSAND VIRTUAL MACHINES
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00129	AND OUR FINAL CHALLENGE IS THE FUNDING MODEL WHILE COMMERCIAL ENTITIES SEE THE BENEFIT OF PAY AS YOU GO SERVICES THE ACADEMIC GRANT FUNDING MECHANISM IS LESS READY FOR THE CONCEPT WE'RE LOOKING TO SEE HOW TO BEST MANAGE THAT WITH OUR PARTNERS THROUGH THE OPERATING MODEL AND POTENTIALLY WITH CENTRALIZED FUNDING
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00131	TO WRAP UP WE'RE NOW AT A POINT WHERE WE'VE PROVEN THE VALUE IN GENOMIC ANALYSIS AND ARE SEEING WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING BEING EMBEDDED IN CLINICAL PATHWAYS
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00132	THROUGH A YEAR OF COVID GEONOMICS HAS ENTERED THE COMMON LANGUAGE THE NEXT PHASE IS SCALING WITH MORE DATA WE CAN COLLECTIVELY CONDUCT MORE ANALYSIS AND GENERATE NEW PERSONALIZED THERAPEUTICS DIAGNOSTICS AND PREVENTIVE TREATMENTS
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00133	THE POTENTIAL GLOBAL IMPACT IS ENORMOUS OUR ENVIRONMENTS ARE ESTABLISHED NOT SO THAT WE CAN CONDUCT RESEARCH BUT SO THAT YOU CAN

YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00135	WE WELCOME COLLABORATIONS WITH ACADEMIA BIOTECH PHARMA AND OTHERS OTHERS INTERESTED IN USING GENOMICS TO TURN SCIENCE INTO HEALTHCARE USING TECHNOLOGY
YTB+83RYIiFTcIk+00137	THANKS FOR YOUR TIME
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00002	I'M GOING TO GET RID OF THE MEETING CONTROLS VERY QUICKLY TOO
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00004	HI GUYS I'M EMMA
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00005	AND EMILY
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00006	AND WE ARE FROM PITT DANCE MARATHON AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IMPLEMENTING EFFECTIVE STEWARDSHIP FOR YOUR DANCE MARATHON
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00008	SO IN OUR PRESENTATION WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE TWO PRONGED APPROACH THAT WE TAKE AT PDUM TO DONOR STEWARDSHIP INCLUDE BANK STEWARDING AS AN ORGANIZATION AND STEWARDING AS FOR INDIVIDUALS
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00009	AND SOME EXAMPLES OF BOTH OF THOSE AND WHAT WE DID IN OUR PROGRAM THIS YEAR AND THEN WAYS THAT OTHER DANCE MARATHONS CAN IMPLEMENT THEM AND THOSE METHODS INTO THEIR PROGRAMS IN THE FUTURE
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00011	SO WE TAKE A TWO PRONGED APPROACH TO
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00013	STEWARDING IN TERMS OF THAT FROM AN INDIVIDUAL POINT OF VIEW AND THAT FROM AN ORGANIZATIONAL STANDPOINT
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00014	SO IN TERMS OF INDIVIDUAL STEWARDSHIP THIS REFERS TO THE RESOURCES AND PLANS THAT ARE IMPLEMENTED FOR PARTICIPANTS AND STAFF MEMBERS TO USE WHERE THEY THEMSELVES ARE ENCOURAGED TO THANK THOSE WHO HAVE DONATED TO THEIR FUNDRAISING EFFORTS
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00015	SO THIS INCLUDES TEMPLATES AND OUTLINES THAT WE PROVIDE TO EVERY UM INDIVIDUAL INVOLVED IN PDUM TO SEND OUT WHENCE THEY RECEIVE DONATIONS UM FROM DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00016	AND THEN ORGANIZATIONAL STEWARDSHIP WHICH REFERS TO THE STEWARDING EFFORTS THAT ARE DONE ON BEHALF OF ALL OF PITTANCE MARATHON
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00017	SO THIS INCLUDES EMAILS THAT ARE SENT OUT FROM THE PDUM TO ALL DONORS UM TO SPECIFIC CATEGORIES OF DONORS THAT SORT OF THING
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00019	YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING WHY WE DO THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE AND REALLY IT'S BECAUSE IT COVERS UP ALL OF THE BASES SO SOME PEOPLE DONATE BECAUSE THEY'RE SUPPORTING THE PERSON THAT'S RAISING THE MONEY
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00020	BUT OTHER PEOPLE MAY DONATE BECAUSE THEY REALLY JUST WANT TO SUPPORT THE CAUSE NO MATTER WHO THE FUNDRAISER IS
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00021	SO FOR MONEY DONORS IT'S A COMBINATION OF THE TWO SO USING THIS TWO PRONGED APPROACH CHANGES THE FORM OF THANK YOU THAT WILL BE MOST EFFECTIVE FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL DONOR
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00022	SO THOSE THAT DONATED TO SUPPORT THE INDIVIDUAL FUNDRAISER WILL TYPICALLY FEEL MORE TOUCHED AND APPRECIATED WHENEVER THAT PERSON REACHES OUT TO THEM DIRECTLY
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00023	WHETHER IT'S AN EMAIL A TEXT THANK YOU CARD ANYTHING LIKE THAT
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00024	BUT THOSE THAT ARE MORE ATTACHED TO THE ENTIRE CAUSE OF DANCE MARATHONS WILL REALLY APPRECIATE THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THEIR CONTRIBUTION FROM THE ENTIRE ORGANIZATION
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00025	AND FOR APPRECIATING THE OVERALL THANK YOU AS WELL AS ANY UPDATES FROM THE ORGANIZATION OR NEW INFORMATION WE CAN PROVIDE THEM FOLLOWING THEIR DONATION
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00026	THIS ALSO HELPS DISPERSE THE RESPONSIBILITY IN THE WORKLOAD OF STEWARDSHIP BECAUSE IT ENCOURAGES INDIVIDUAL STAFF MEMBERS AND PARTICIPANTS TO MAKE THE EFFORTS OF THANKING THEIR DONORS
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00027	SO THAT THE STEWARDSHIP CHAIR OR COMMITTEE OR WHATEVER YOU MAY HAVE AT YOUR DANCE MARATHON ISN'T AS RESPONSIBLE FOR SENDING OUT INDIVIDUAL TEXT MESSAGES OR THANK YOU'S TO EACH SINGLE DONOR
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00028	THIS WOULDN'T BE AS EFFECTIVE ANYWAY BECAUSE WHOEVER'S IN CHARGE OF STEWARDSHIP WON'T KNOW EACH AND EVERY DONOR AS WELL AS EACH FUNDRAISER WILL SO THIS MAKES IT WAY MORE IMPACTFUL AND PERSONALIZED
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00030	SO FOCUSING ON STEWARDING AS AN ORGANIZATION ONE OF THE MAIN GOALS AND MAIN ITEMS IN TERMS OF STEWARDING AS AN ORGANIZATION IS THE HIGH LEVEL OF CONSISTENCY IN ORGANIZATIONAL SKILLS
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00031	THAT IT REQUIRES BECAUSE OF THE QUANTITY OF INDIVIDUALS GROUPS AND COMPANIES TO BE THANKED SO DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF YOUR DAN MARATHON THERE ARE HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF DONORS IN A GIVEN YEAR
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00032	WHICH IS AN EXTREMELY LARGE LIST OF NAMES TO KEEP TRACK OF AND STAY ON TOP OF THINKING SO WE HAVE FOUND THAT IT'S SUPER IMPORTANT TO CREATE AND MAINTAIN A ROBUST LIST OF DONORS BY PULLING FREQUENT REPORTS FROM DONOR DRIVE TO KEEP TRACK OF ALL OF THE DONORS
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00033	SO WE TYPICALLY FIND IT MOST USEFUL TO ORGANIZE THESE DONORS INTO DIFFERENT CATEGORIES
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00034	AND CREATE DIFFERENT EXCEL SHEETS AND THAT SORT OF THINGS BASED ON DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS THOSE WHO HAVE DONATED MULTIPLE TIMES THOSE WHO HAVE DONATED OVER ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS DIFFERENT KIND OF CHARACTERISTICS LIKE THAT
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00035	AND SO IT'S EXTREMELY HELPFUL IN BREAKING ALL OF THIS DOWN TO KEEP TRACK OF EACH INDIVIDUAL'S DIFFERENT CONTRIBUTIONS AND THEN CREATING THIS ROBUST LIST THAT YOU MAINTAIN AND CAN SOURCE FROM DONOR DRIVE
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00036	EASILY ALLOWS YOU TO PERSONALIZE THE EMAILS THAT WILL BE GOING TO A GROUP SO EVEN THOUGH IT'S JUST THE ORGANIZATION SENDING A MASS EMAIL SO TO SPEAK SO YOU STILL WILL BE SENDING AN EMAIL TO MAYBE A FEW HUNDRED PEOPLE AT ONCE
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00037	IT IS MORE SPECIFIC IN TERMS OF ACKNOWLEDGING OR ACKNOWLEDGING EXACTLY WHAT THEY DONATED
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00038	AND GAVE IT TO THE CAUSE SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU BREAK IT DOWN INTO WHO DONATED FIFTY DOLLARS WHO DONATED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS WHO DONATED TWO TO TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS AND ETC
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00039	THIS GIVES YOU A SMALLER COHORT OF DONORS SO YOU CAN PROVIDE THEM INFORMATION ON HOW MUCH THEIR DONATION UM WILL SUPPORT UH THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OR CHILDREN'S MIRACLE NETWORK FOR EXAMPLE SO
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00040	YOU CAN INCLUDE MORE PERSONALIZED DETAILS SUCH AS AS A DONOR OF OVER FIFTY DOLLARS YOU WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE X TO A CHILD AT THE HOSPITAL
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00041	AND THIS IN GENERAL JUST GETS THEM MORE CONNECTED TO THE CAUSE AND ALLOWS THEM TO SEE WHAT TYPE OF IMPACT THEIR DONATIONS ARE HAVING
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00042	AND AGAIN IT'S JUST A WAY TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT MORE PERSONALIZED WHILE STILL BEING ABLE TO SEND IT OUT TO LARGE COHORTS OF DONORS
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00044	AND WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT IS TO GET CREATIVE THE MORE CREATIVE THAT YOUR ORGANIZATION CAN GET IN WAYS OF THANKING AND STEWARDING DONORS THE MORE EXCITING IT IS FOR THOSE DONORS
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00045	THEY DON'T NECESSARILY JUST WANT AN EMAIL THAT SAYS THANK YOU FOR DONATING TO OUR DANCE MARATHON THEY REALLY LIKE THE UNIQUE THINGS THAT HELPS THEM FEEL MORE APPRECIATED AND MORE RECOGNIZED
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00046	SO PERSONALIZING EMAILS FOR DIFFERENT GROUPS LIKE THIS IS ONE OF THE EASIEST WAYS TO IMPROVE ON THE MASS EMAIL METHOD AS WELL AS SENDING VIRTUAL POSTCARDS OR THANK YOU CARDS TO THOSE WHO HAVE DONATED A LOT OF MONEY TO YOU
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00048	WORK WITH YOUR MARKETING TEAM OR WHOEVER MAY BE IN CHARGE OF GRAPHICS ON YOUR TEAM TO CREATE CUTE DESIGNS AND INTERESTING CONCEPTS
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00049	MAYBE THEY TIE INTO YOUR OVERALL BRANDING AS AN ORGANIZATION OR YOUR CAMPAIGN OR IF YOU HAD A THEME FOR YOUR PUSH DAY ANYTHING LIKE THAT UM IT REALLY HELPS TO ELEVATE THE STEWARDSHIP MATERIALS
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00051	SO ONE OF OUR BIGGEST INITIATIVES AT PDMA THIS YEAR FOR STEWARDSHIP WAS OUR STEWARDSHIP SPOTLIGHTS DURING OUR DANCE MARATHON
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00052	SO ONCE AN HOUR THERE WAS A SLOT OF A FEW MINUTES SET ASIDE TO FOR PREPARED STEWARDSHIP SHOUT OUTS WHERE WE WOULD GET ON STAGE AND RECOGNIZE AND APPLAUD SOME OF OUR TOP DONORS
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00053	SO THIS CAME IN THE FORM OF THANKING ALL OF THE BUSINESSES THAT DONATED TO OUR ORGANIZATION IN ANY WAY OVER THE PAST YEAR THANKING AND SHOUTING OUT HIGHEST FUNDRAISERS OF THE HOUR DAY YEAR AND SO ON
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00055	SO WE DID THIS TO DEDICATE EXPLICIT TIME DURING ALL OF THE CRAZINESS AND FUN HAPPENING DURING OUR MAIN EVENT TO THANK EVERYBODY WHO MADE A BIG IMPACT ON THE REVIEW AT THE END OF THE DAY
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00057	WE WANTED TO INCORPORATE THESE SPOTLIGHTS AFTER PERFORMERS SO THAT WAY THERE WOULD BE A LARGE CROWD BY THE STAGE SO THAT MORE AND MORE PEOPLE COULD RECOGNIZE OUR DONORS AND THE PEOPLE THAT MADE OUR FUNDRAISING POSSIBLE
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00059	DURING THESE TIMES WE EVEN CALLED UP CERTAIN PEOPLE TO THE STAGE TO APPLAUD AND THANK THEM IF THEY WERE AT OUR EVENT
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00060	AS WELL AS INVITING REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE BUSINESSES THAT HAD DONATED TO US TO COME TO OUR EVENT SO THEY COULD BE RECOGNIZED ON THE STAGE
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00062	NOW SWITCHING OVER TO THE SECOND PRONG OF INDIVIDUAL STEWARDSHIP
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00063	SO INDIVIDUAL STEWARDSHIP IS ALWAYS A BIT DIFFICULT WE HAVE FOUND IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY GETTING PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF STAFF MEMBERS TO USE THE RESOURCES THAT ARE PROVIDED
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00064	AND TAKE THE TIME AND EFFORT TO PROPERLY PROPERLY STEWARD RECOGNIZE AND THANK THEIR DONORS UM SO WE FOUND THAT CREATING TEMPLATES AND EMAIL DRAFTS AND TEXT EXAMPLES IS GREAT BUT IF NOT MANY PEOPLE ACTUALLY USE THEM IT KIND OF DEFECTS THE POINT
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00065	SO THIS YEAR ONE OF OUR MAIN GOALS IN TERMS OF STEWARDSHIP FOR OUR DANCE MARATHON WAS TO INCREASE PARTICIPANT STEWARDSHIP SO TO TRY TO GET AS MANY PARTICIPANTS AS POSSIBLE NOT JUST STAFF MEMBERS TO THANK THOSE
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00066	THAT HAD DONATED TO THEM
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00068	AND SO WE REPORTED THEM IN MEANINGFUL WAYS SO THIS INVOLVED NOT ONLY FIGURING OUT HOW TO DISTRIBUTE RESOURCES BUT HOW TO GET PARTICIPANTS TO USE THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAD CREATED AS WELL
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00069	SO THE MAIN IDEA FOR INDIVIDUAL STEWARDSHIP IN TRYING TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL IN THIS EFFORT WAS CREATING AND IMPLEMENTING WHAT WE CALLED A STEWARDSHIP MATRIX
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00070	SO ESSENTIALLY THIS WAS A CHART THAT GAVE A RECOMMENDATION OF WHAT STEWARDING EFFORT OR METHOD THE INDIVIDUAL SHOULD USE TO THANK A DONOR DEPENDENT ON THE AMOUNT THAT THE PERSON DONATED
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00071	SO FOR EXAMPLE IF A PERSON DONATED OVER A HUNDRED DOLLARS WE SUGGESTED AND GAVE THE INDIVIDUAL RESOURCES TO SEND THOSE PEOPLE A VIRTUAL THANK YOU CARD
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00072	SO THE THOUGHT BEHIND THIS WAS REALLY THAT IT WAS A CLEAR IF WE GAVE A CLEAR CUT SIMPLE GUIDELINE AND METHOD FOR PEOPLE TO FOLLOW IT WOULD PROVIDE A BARE MINIMUM IN A SENSE THAT PEOPLE WOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO FOLLOW
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00073	BECAUSE ALMOST ALL OF THE WORK WAS DONE FOR THEM UM IF IT WAS LAID OUT
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00074	BASED ON WHO TO SEND WHAT TO BASED ON THEIR AMOUNT OF DONATIONS AND SO OBVIOUSLY IF THEY WANTED TO DO MORE THAN WHAT WE HAD ON THE MATRIX THAT WAS WONDERFUL AND ENCOURAGED BUT THE HOPE WAS THAT INDIVIDUALS WOULD SEE THEY'RE PROVIDED
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00075	AND PARTICIPANTS WOULD SEE THE PROVIDED INSTRUCTIONS AND GUIDANCE AND FOLLOW IT
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00077	SO ON THE NEXT SLIDE IS AN EXAMPLE OF OUR MATRIX THIS WAS OUR MATRIX DURING A FUNDRAISING PUSH DAY THAT WE HAD IN THE SPRING
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00078	UM THE MATRIX WAS EASILY MODIFIABLE DEPENDING ON THE EVENT OR SITUATION THAT WE WERE USING IT FOR BUT THIS IS AN EXAMPLE FOR THE SPRING PUSH DAY
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00079	SO AS YOU CAN SEE IT GIVES GUIDANCE ON UM WHAT STEWARDSHIP METHODS TO TAKE UM DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH A DONOR UM DONATED TO THEM
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00080	AND ALONG ALONG WITH THIS WE HAD ALL OF THE RESOURCES LINKED IN THE MATRIX SO THAT PEOPLE COULD EASILY GO FIND THE EMAIL TEXT AND SEND IT RIGHT AWAY
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00081	OR IN INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE VIRTUAL THANK YOU CARDS WITH THE LINK ALL OF THAT SORT OF THING UM EVERYTHING EXTREMELY PREPARED
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00082	SO THAT PEOPLE COULD USE THE SIMPLE GUIDELINES AND NOT REQUIRE MUCH EFFORT TO HOPEFULLY INCREASE THEIR PARTICIPATION IN OUR STEWARDSHIP EFFORTS
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00084	SO IN TERMS OF THE DISTRIBUTION LIKE WE MENTIONED DISTRIBUTING THE INDIVIDUAL STEWARDSHIP MATERIALS IS A VERY PART VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE PLAN AND FOR THIS WE TEAMED UP WITH THE MARKETING AND RECRUITMENT PANELS OF OUR ORGANIZATION
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00085	SO WHOEVER IS IN CHARGE OF UM THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PARTICIPANTS OR CREATING THE DIFFERENT GRAPHICS AND MATERIALS THAT YOU PUT OUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND THAT SORT OF THING
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00086	AS WHO WOULD RECOMMEND WORKING WITH FOR THIS PART OF THE PLAN
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00087	UM SO WE HAD OUR RECRUITMENT TEAM SEND OUT THE MATERIALS IN THEIR PARTICIPANT EMAILS WHILE HAVING MARKETING SHARING THE INFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA SO POSTING THE MATERIALS IN ADVANCE OF THE EVENT
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00088	AS WELL AS DURING THE DAY OF SO GIVING CONSTANT AND EASY ACCESS TO EVERYTHING A PERSON COULD NEED FOR THINKING THEIR DONORS
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00089	SO WE HAD MARKETING REPOST EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE USING THE METHODS OUTLINED IN THE MATRIX ON THE INSTAGRAM STORY THROUGHOUT THE DAY JUST AS A REMINDER FOR PEOPLE TO THANK THEIR DONORS AND AGAIN THE RESOURCES WERE RIGHT THERE ON SOCIAL MEDIA
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00090	OR IN THEIR EMAIL INBOX OR GROUP ME OR WHATEVER METHOD YOU MAY USE
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00091	UM AND WE JUST KEPT ENCOURAGING THROUGHOUT THE DAY UM TO REMEMBER TO USE THE PROVIDED MATERIALS THAT WE HAD GIVEN UM THAT WERE CLEAR CUT AND RIGHT THERE FOR
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00093	SO IN TERMS OF SUCCESS THIS WAS BY NO MEANS A ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SUCCESSFUL EFFORT THERE WERE STILL PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T NECESSARILY TAKE THE INITIATIVE TO THANK THEIR DONORS EVEN WITH
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00094	THIS THESE TEMPLATES BUT WE DID SEE A VERY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS THAT WERE STEWARDING THEIR DONORS
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00095	WE ALSO RECEIVED AMAZING FEEDBACK FROM PARTICIPANTS THAT THEY USED THE MATRIX BECAUSE IT WAS EASY TO USE AND DIDN'T TAKE A LOT OF TIME OR EFFORT ON THEIR PART
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00096	THEY ALSO COMMENTED THAT THEY REALLY APPRECIATED ALL OF THE STEWARDING MATERIALS BEING FOUND IN ONE LOCATION SO THAT WAY ALL OF IT WAS EASY TO ACCESS EASY TO LOCATE AND EASY TO COME BACK TO TO THANK THEIR DONORS NEXT TIME AS WELL
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00098	SO NOW IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTING WHAT WE DID THIS YEAR AT PDM INTO OTHER PROGRAMS NOTHING THAT WE DID IN TERMS OF STEWARDSHIP AT PDM THIS YEAR WAS SUPER SPECIFIC TO OUR PROGRAM
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00099	MEANING THAT IT CAN EASILY BE REPLICATED AND UTILIZED AND ADAPTED AND IN OTHER DANCE MARATHON PROGRAMS SO FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE STEWARDSHIP MATRIX IT CAN DEFINITELY BE TAILORED TO WHATEVER YOUR PROGRAM
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00100	NEEDS AND WHATEVER SO LIKE YOU CAN PUT IN YOUR ORGANIZATION'S FAVORITE FORM OF STEWARDSHIP PREVIOUS TEMPLATES THAT YOU'VE CREATED UM USING IT AS AN ORGANIZATION TOOL IN THAT WAY
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00101	AND TAILORED MORE SPECIFICALLY TO YOUR ORGANIZATION IN THAT WAY AND IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF DONORS WHO DONATE HIGH AMOUNTS OF MONEY FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN ALTER THE MATRIX TO REFLECT THIS IN MAKING IT GO TO HIGHER LEVELS REVERSES
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00102	OURS DURING LIKE PUSH DAYS WHERE WE HAD JUST A GENERAL TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE PLUS CATEGORY SO IF YOU HAVE LOTS OF DONORS WHO DONATE LARGER AMOUNTS OF MONEY YOU CAN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR HIGHER AMOUNTS OF DONATIONS
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00103	AND THEN IN TERMS OF STEWARDSHIP SPOTLIGHTS THERE ARE ALSO A SUPER EASY BUT EFFECTIVE WAY TO RECOGNIZE THANK AND APPLAUD SOME OF THE HIGHEST DONORS AND THIS CAN BE EASILY DONE DURING ANY OF YOUR UM DANCE MARATHONS OR HUMANE EVENTS
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00104	I'M JUST SETTING IT ASIDE A FEW MINUTES THE HOUR OR HOWEVER YOU'RE ORGANIZATION WANTS TO DO IT UM IT'S IT'S EASY TO SET ASIDE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING TO SET ASIDE A FEW FIVE MINUTE SEGMENTS THROUGHOUT THE DAY
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00105	FOR SOMEONE TO GET UP ON STAGE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE TOP DONORS IMPORTANT COMPANIES ALL OF THAT SORT OF THING
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00107	SO JUST IN GENERAL FOCUSING ON STEWARDSHIP AND ORGANIZATION AND AND ORGANIZATIONAL STEWARDSHIP WILL HELP TO COVER ALL OF THE BASIS IN THANKING YOUR DONORS BECAUSE IT'S MUCH BETTER FOR THEM TO RECEIVE THANK YOU'S FROM INDIVIDUALS
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00108	AND THE ORGANIZATION RATHER THAN RECEIVE A THANK YOU FROM NO ONE JUST AS IT'S BETTER TO THANK THEM AT MULTIPLE POINTS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS COMPARED TO NOT THANKING THEM A SINGLE TIME
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00109	SO THAT WAS KIND OF THE MOTIVATION BEHIND OUR STEWARDSHIP EFFORTS THIS YEAR AND I THINK THAT YOU CAN TAKE A LOT OF THE DIFFERENT METHODS THAT WE UTILIZE
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00110	AND EASILY ADAPT THEM AND ADJUST THEM TO FIT THE NEEDS OF YOUR PROGRAM AND YOUR PARTICIPANTS AND YOUR DONORS
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00112	JUST TO WRAP IT UP MAKE SURE THAT YOU GOT THE MAIN POINTS OF OUR PRESENTATION AND WHAT WE HAVE DONE AND WHAT YOU COULD IMPLEMENT REMEMBER TO FOCUS ON INDIVIDUAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL STEWARDSHIP
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00113	GET SO CREATIVE AS CREATIVE AS YOU CAN GET AS MANY PEOPLE FROM YOUR ORGANIZATION INVOLVED TO COME UP WITH WAYS TO STEWARD DONORS AND MAKE THEM FEEL AS APPRECIATED AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE REALLY DO APPRECIATE ALL THAT THEY DO
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00114	AND THEN FOCUS ON STEWARDING ALL DONORS NO MATTER HOW MUCH MONEY THEY DONATE WHETHER YOU'RE CANNING AND THEY PUT TWENTY FIVE CENTS IN
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00115	OR IT'S SOMEBODY WHO DONATED A THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE MAKE SURE THAT ALL DONORS FEEL APPRECIATED BECAUSE EVERYTHING THEY DO MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE FOR OUR ORGANIZATIONS
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00117	YEAH THAT IS OUR PRESENTATION IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AT ALL PLEASE FEEL FREE TO REACH OUT TO US YOU CAN FIND US AT PIT UNDER SCORED PDMS ON INSTAGRAM
YTB+95QidsysvhM+00118	DAMUS IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR DAMUS IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW WE'RE STEWARD STEWARDING OUR DONORS THIS YEAR THANK YOU THANK YOU
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00002	UM SO WHY TWITTER THIS IS A GOOD QUESTION UM THERE ARE MILLIONS OF TWITTER USERS
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00004	AND A LOT OF TIMES THEY'LL BE DIFFERENT FROM YOUR FACEBOOK FAN BASE SO YOU COULD BE REACHING NEW POTENTIAL PEOPLE
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00005	IT'S KIND OF AN INTERESTING PLATFORM BECAUSE YOU ONLY HAVE ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY CHARACTERS TO TELL YOUR STORY SO YOU HAVE TO BE SHORT YOU HAVE TO BE BRIEF
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00006	IT'S WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL COME TO SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCES PROVIDE FEEDBACK WHERE THEY'RE LOOKING TO GET CUSTOMER SERVICE
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00007	UM A LOT OF TIMES WE'LL GET QUESTIONS ON TWITTER LIKE I'M HAVING TROUBLE WITH THE VOLUNTEER DEPARTMENT WHAT CAN I DO WELL I MEAN WE CAN GIVE THEM THE THE EMAIL ADDRESS TO OUR VOLUNTEERS
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00008	UM AND TRY TO HELP THEM AS BEST WE CAN
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00010	HOW DOES TWITTER WORK AS I MENTIONED IT'S UP TO FORTY CHARACTERS PER TWEET THAT INCLUDES ALL PUNCTUATION AND SPACES
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00011	AND IF YOU WANT TO INCLUDE A PICTURE IN YOUR TWEET THAT ALSO TAKES UP ROOM SO
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00012	SHORT AND SWEET IS KIND OF THE AND GAME FOR TWITTER
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00014	THE MESSAGES THAT YOU WRITE WHICH ARE ALSO KNOWN AS TWEETS ARE PUBLIC YOU CAN CREATE A PRIVATE PROFILE IF YOU WANT TO DO THAT PERSONALLY
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00015	I WOULD DEFINITELY NOT RECOMMEND THAT FOR AN ORGANIZATION YOU WOULD WANT TO DO SOMETHING PUBLIC
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00017	AND THE OTHER THING THAT'S COOL ABOUT TWITTER IS IT'S SIMILAR TO FACEBOOK AS IN UM YOU CAN DO IT ON YOUR COMPUTER YOU CAN BE ON YOUR PHONE AND CHECK UPDATES
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00018	YOU CAN BE ON YOUR IPAD IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE COOL APPS THAT YOU CAN CHECK FROM ANYTHING
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00020	AND THESE ARE SOME OF THE TWITTER KEY TERMS I'M NOT GOING TO READ THROUGH ALL OF THEM BUT I MAY REFERENCE SOME OF THESE
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00022	THE MAIN THING RETWEET THE RT IS SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT'S MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD BE INTERESTED IN DOING MISHARING CONTENT FROM SOMEONE ELSE
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00023	SO API COULD RETWEET A MESSAGE FROM BEST FRIENDS
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00024	MAYBE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAYBE IT'S ONE OF OUR BLOG POSTS THAT'S TALKING ABOUT WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO ADOPT VERSUS
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00025	BUYING UM TRYING TO THINK WHAT OUR RECENT BLOG POSTS HAVE BEEN CAN'T THINK VETERAN
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00027	BUT YOU CAN SHARE CONTENT FROM ANOTHER PAGE WHICH IS PRETTY COOL
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00029	AND THEN I MENTIONED HASHTAGS FOR FACEBOOK HASHTAGS ARE VERY POPULAR ON TWITTER SO WHEREVER YOU CAN TRY TO FIT IN THOSE HASHTAGS
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00030	ON TWITTER WE TRY TO USE HASHTAG SAVE THEM ALL A LOT AND WE WILL ALSO MONITOR THAT HASHTAG TO SEE WHO'S USING IT TO SEE IF THERE ARE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE CAN JOIN
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00031	UM ANY QUESTIONS WE CAN RESPOND TO JUST KIND OF KEEP AN EYE ON YOU KNOW WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT SAVE THEM ALL BECAUSE THAT'S OUR OUR MOTTO UM
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00032	YOU CAN ALSO CHECK HASHTAGS LIKE ADOPT OR ADOPT DON'T SHOP
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00033	UM AND JUST SEE YOU KNOW WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT KIND OF GENERAL CONVERSATION AND WHICH IS ALWAYS INTERESTING AND YOU CAN ALWAYS JUMP IN AND RESPOND TO PEOPLE UM AND ENGAGE THAT WAY
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00035	AND THEN AS I MENTIONED SINCE THERE ARE ONLY ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY CHARACTERS IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO SHORTEN YOUR LINKS
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00036	TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WILL FIT WITHIN A TWEET AND WE USE BITLY OF BEST FRIENDS
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00037	IT'S A FREE TOOL IT'S VERY COOL YOU CAN ALSO CUSTOMIZE YOUR LINKS WE USE BITLY FOR FACEBOOK AS WELL BECAUSE IT TRACKS HOW MANY PEOPLE CLICK THROUGH
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00039	VERY USEFUL
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00041	TWITTER IS RELATIVELY EASY TO SIGN UP FOR YOU JUST FILL OUT A PROFILE AND INCLUDE A PICTURE GENERALLY THAT'S GOING TO BE YOUR ORGANIZATION'S LOGO
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00042	THEY KIND OF HAVE THIS NEW COOL LAYOUT THAT THEY'VE INTRODUCED IN THE PAST YEAR SO IT'S ALMOST LIKE A COVER PHOTO THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT LOOK MORE LIKE FACEBOOK ESSENTIALLY
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00043	BUT WHEN WE GO THROUGH IT YOU CAN SEE THERE IS LIKE A COVER PHOTO AREA AND THEN A
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00045	YOUR TWITTER ICON AS WELL
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00047	TWEETING TIPS SAME THING AS FACEBOOK AS FAR AS CONTENT PEOPLE LIKE LINKS TO INTERESTING STORIES THEY LIKE BLOG POSTS DEALS
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00048	YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE CHEEKINESS ON TWITTER THAN YOU CAN ON FACEBOOK AND JUST BE A LITTLE FUNNY THAT'S KIND OF MORE OF THE PLATFORM AND THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ON IT
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00050	AND A COOL THING THAT HAS BEEN DOING REALLY WELL ON TWITTER IS IF YOU ACTUALLY JUST
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00051	USE TWITTER DOT COM WE USE HOOTS SUITE TO MANAGE OUR TWITTER ACCOUNT BUT IF YOU GO TO TWITTER DOT COM YOU CAN UPLOAD A PHOTO WITHIN YOUR TWEET
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00052	AND IT MAKES YOUR TWEET MUCH BIGGER UM ON THE TWITTER NEWSFEED AND UM IT JUST LOOKS REALLY COOL IT'S VERY VISUAL SO IF YOU HAVE A GOOD PHOTO YOU CAN INCLUDE IN A TWEET
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00053	DEFINITELY DO THAT THE ONLY PROBLEM BEING THAT A PHOTO WILL TAKE UP CHARACTERS SO
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00054	KIND OF GOT TO BE AWARE OF THAT SO IF YOU'RE DOING A PHOTO AND A LINK THEN YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE VERY MANY CHARACTERS TO ACTUALLY
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00056	SWITCH CAP
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00058	SO THE QUESTION IS HOW VALUABLE IS TWITTER IN MANAGING LIKE A SMALLER GROUP OF ABOUT A THOUSAND VOLUNTEERS AND I WOULD SAY IT'S NOT VERY VALUABLE
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00059	VALUABLE FOR YOU I WOULD SAY FOR THE ORGANIZATION OVERALL UM IT'S NICE TO HAVE A TWITTER PRESENCE IF YOU HAVE THE TIME AND RESOURCES
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00060	TO MANAGE IT IF YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT TIME AND RESOURCES I WOULD DEFINITELY SAY THAT FACEBOOK IS NUMBER ONE IT'S NUMBER ONE FOR US IT CONTINUES TO BE NUMBER ONE FOR
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00061	MOST ANIMAL ADOPTION ORGANIZATIONS INSTAGRAM IS ANOTHER COOL
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00063	COOL TOOL THAT PEOPLE ARE USING UM AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS GROWN IMMENSELY FOR US AS WELL AND THAT TAKES A LITTLE LESS TIME THAN TWITTER I WOULD SAY FOR TWITTER TO BE
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00064	VALUABLE AND SUCCESSFUL FOR YOU THERE HAS TO BE TIME SPENT ON IT
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00065	SO TIME SPENT FINDING COOL CONTENT AND SHARING IT TIME SPENT RESPONDING TO PEOPLE TIME SPENT TRACKING HASHTAGS AND SEEING YOU KNOW WHAT THE CONVERSATIONS ARE
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00066	THERE'S JUST THERE'S A LOT OF ENGAGEMENT ON TWITTER AND YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF ENGAGEMENT ON FACEBOOK AS WELL AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN HELP MAKE YOUR PAGE A SUCCESS BUT FOR TWITTER THAT'S
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00067	UM THAT'S ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE THINGS YOU DEFINITELY CAN'T JUST TALK AT PEOPLE YOU TALK TO PEOPLE UM AND THAT'S WHAT THE TWITTER AUDIENCE EXPECTS IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE PRESENT ON TWITTER
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00069	SO BEST PRACTICES RELATIONSHIP BUILDING IS KEY LISTEN FOR COMMENTS ABOUT YOU RESPOND TO COMMENTS AND QUERIES UM YOU CAN ALSO DO A SEARCH
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00070	SO NOT ONLY CAN YOU SEE PEOPLE WHO ARE TWEETING DIRECTLY TO YOU OR MENTIONING YOU BUT YOU CAN DO A SEARCH FOR YOUR ORGANIZATION
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00071	AND SEE WHERE ELSE YOU'RE MENTIONED WHERE PEOPLE MIGHT NOT EVEN REALIZE THAT YOU'RE ACTIVE ON TWITTER
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00072	YOU CAN ASK LOTS OF QUESTIONS ON TWITTER AND THAT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE IF THERE'S LIKE A TRENDING
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00073	LIKE THE OTHER DAY IT WAS NATIONAL LOVE YOUR PET DAY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO WE POSTED A CUTE PICTURE
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00074	OF A DOG GIVING A KISS TO ONE OF OUR CAREGIVERS AND THEN JUST ASKED YOU KNOW IT'S NOT A LOVE YOUR PET DAY WITH THE HASH TAG HOW ARE YOU CELEBRATING OR SHOW US HOW YOU'RE CELEBRATING
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00075	SO TWITTER IS A GREAT WAY TO KIND OF BUILD ENGAGEMENT LIKE THAT WHERE IT'S JUST GENERAL QUESTIONS YOU CAN ASK YOUR AUDIENCE AND AND GET THEM TO RESPOND TO YOU AND
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00076	ENGAGE WITH YOU AND KIND OF KIND OF BUILD YOUR BRAND THAT WAY
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00078	YOU CAN ALSO RETWEET MESSAGES YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE WHICH I MENTIONED UM AND I CAN SHOW YOU HOW TO DO THAT WHEN WE GET TO THE LIVE DRIVE
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00080	AND THE OTHER THING ABOUT TWITTER IS THAT IT'S VERY REAL TIME PEOPLE WILL RESPOND QUICKLY AND THEY WILL EXPECT YOU TO RESPOND QUICKLY
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00081	YOU KNOW TWENTY FOUR HOURS OR LESS IS KIND OF OUR GO TO ON TWITTER
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00082	WE WE TRY TO BE VERY QUICK WE PRETTY MUCH TRY TO RESPOND TO ANYONE WHO UM TREATS US WITHIN AN HOUR ON WEEKDAYS DURING BUSINESS HOURS
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00083	YOU KNOW AFTER HOURS ARE ONE THING AND WEEKENDS ARE ANOTHER THING AND WE DO MONITOR AND RESPOND ON WEEKENDS AS WELL
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00084	BUT UM THERE THERE IS DEFINITELY AN EXPECTATION THAT IF YOU ARE ACTIVE ON TWITTER THEN YOU SHOULD BE ACTIVE AND YOU SHOULD BE RESPONSIVE
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00086	OKAY THE QUESTION IS YEAH SO THE QUESTION IS WHY IS AN AVERAGE PERSON ON TWITTER THE ANSWER IS BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THEMSELVES
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00088	UM YES NARCISSISM YOU KNOW TWITTER IS A MICRO BLOG ESSENTIALLY
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00089	SO GIVES YOU ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY CHARACTERS TO SAY WHAT YOU ATE FOR BREAKFAST OR SAY THAT YOU JUST WORKED OUT OH PEOPLE LOVE TO SHARE THEIR WORKOUTS
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00091	UM CROSS FITTERS ESPECIALLY LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THEIR WORKOUTS UM
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00092	THEY LIKE TO SHARE PHOTOS AGAIN YOU KNOW SAME THING WITH INSTAGRAM IT'S JUST SHARING PHOTOS PEOPLE LIKE TO SHARE
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00094	WHAT THEY WANT ABOUT THEIR LIVES WITH OTHERS AND THEY WANT TO GET FEEDBACK AND THEY WANT TO FEEL VALIDATION
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00096	YEAH UM SO THE QUESTION IS WOULD TWITTER BE A VALUABLE RECRUITING TOOL UM
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00097	IF YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND VOLUNTEERS AND I WOULD SAY IT DEFINITELY COULD BE IF YOU CAN TAKE THE TIME TO MONITOR CONVERSATIONS UM AND INSERT YOURSELF
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00098	IN THEM WHEREVER YOU CAN YOU KNOW RESPOND TO PEOPLE THAT ARE IN YOUR AREA TALKING ABOUT WORKING OUT YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE A COOL PROGRAM LIKE THE JOG A DOG PROGRAM HERE IN AUSTIN IS AWESOME
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00099	IF YOU HAVE A PROGRAM LIKE THAT AND YOU HAVE A PRESENCE ON TWITTER AND YOU CAN REACH OUT TO PEOPLE YOU CAN ABSOLUTELY USE IT THAT WAY
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00101	PEOPLE PEOPLE REALLY LIKE UM
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00102	THE ACTIVITY AND THE KIND OF YOU KNOW THE CONSTANT FEEDBACK I THINK THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE LOOK FOR ON TWITTER IS YOU KNOW THAT IMMEDIATE GRATIFICATION RESPONSE RIGHT THERE
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00104	YEAH THE QUESTION IS WHEN WE LAUNCH OUR INSTAGRAM UM DID WE SEE A DECREASE ON TWITTER LIKE WAS THERE ANY CANNIBALISM AND I WOULD SAY THERE ISN'T UM INSTAGRAM OVERALL HAS A VERY YOUNG AUDIENCE
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00106	VERY YOUNG UM WHICH IS KIND OF COOL BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU'RE REACHING NEW PEOPLE UM AND INSTAGRAM IS A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN POST A LITTLE BIT
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00108	DIFFERENT CONTENT MORE YOU KNOW BEHIND THE SCENES FUNNY PHOTOS WITH FUNNY CAPTIONS
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00109	IT ALLOWS FOR A LITTLE BIT MORE CREATIVITY AND JUST BECAUSE IT'S THE NATURE OF THAT CHANNEL AND THEN YOU CAN ALSO AGAIN UTILIZE HASHTAGS ON INSTAGRAM TO GET YOUR PHOTO SEEN BY MORE PEOPLE
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00111	NO WE DIDN'T SEE ANY DROP YEAH YEAH OUR TWITTER CONTINUES TO GROW UM
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00113	AND WE DON'T REALLY DO ADVERTISING ON TWITTER WE'VE DONE IT A COUPLE OF TIMES BUT UM I CAN'T THINK OF YOU KNOW MORE THAN A HANDFUL OF TIMES THAT WE'VE

YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00156	ACCOUNTS ARE NORMALLY EITHER ORGANIZATIONS OR CELEBRITIES OR BRANDS WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FOLLOWERS
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00157	SO THESE ARE JUST SOME OF OUR I DON'T NONE OF THESE ARE FAMOUS TO ME E ONLINE THERE WE GO
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00159	SO THIS IS OUR HOME
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00161	PAGE FOR TWITTER
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00163	SO THIS IS THE TIMELINE OF
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00165	THESE ARE ALL PEOPLE THAT WE FOLLOW RIGHT HERE SO THAT'S WHAT'S SHOWING UP IN OUR FEED
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00167	AND AS YOU CAN SEE
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00169	WHEN PEOPLE ARE SUPER SUPER ACTIVE ON TWITTER THERE'S A LOT TO KEEP UP WITH UM YOU COULD DEFINITELY POST A LOT MORE OFTEN ON TWITTER THAN YOU CAN ON FACEBOOK JUST BECAUSE THE LIFE SPAN OF A TWEET
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00170	IS MUCH MUCH SHORTER THAN THE LIFE SPAN OF A FACEBOOK POST SO YOU HAVE A LOT MORE LEEWAY TO POST
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00171	I MEAN WE TRY TO GET OUT FIVE TO SEVEN TWEETS A DAY VERSUS TWO FACEBOOK POSTS A DAY
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00172	AND THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE TWEETS THAT WE HAVE RESPONDING TO PEOPLE AND AND MONITORING HASHTAGS
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00174	YOU CAN SET THAT UP I WOULD NOT ADVISE SETTING THAT UP BECAUSE
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00176	OH HELLO
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00178	SEE WONDERFUL LIVE TWEETING EXAMPLE UM I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND LINKING YOUR FACEBOOK TO YOUR TWITTER BECAUSE THERE'S SUCH DIFFERENT PLATFORMS
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00179	UM THAT IF YOU DO A FACEBOOK POST AND LINK IT TO TWITTER IT'S GOING TO GET CUT OFF IT'S GOING TO BE SHORTENED AND PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO CLICK THROUGH TO A FACEBOOK TO LOOK AT IT YOU WANT TO POST CONTENT THAT IS
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00180	CRAFTED FOR TWITTER CRAFTED FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO SEE UM THE WHOLE THING AT ONCE
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00182	SO THIS IS VERY COOL UM THIS SHOWS ALL THE RETWEETS THE PEOPLE THAT FOLLOW US MENTIONS
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00184	DEALING WITH TROLS
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00186	AND ABLE TO YEAH AND LIKE WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THE HASHTAG AMP TO TWENTY FIFTEEN AND SEE LOOK AT ALL THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE TALKING ABOUT IT
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00188	WHICH IS VERY COOL
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00190	AND SO I'M SURE YOU'RE FOLLOWING THE HASH TAG AND THEN RESPONDING TO THESE PEOPLE SO GREAT WAY TO ENGAGE EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY TAGGING AMERICAN PETS ALIVE ON TWITTER THEY'RE USING THE HASH TAG
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00191	SO YOU CAN STILL RESPOND WITH THEM AND KIND OF CREATE A CONVERSATION AND LET THEM KNOW YOU KNOW YOU'RE PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT THEY'RE SAYING
YTB+DVLSyKTp6dk+00193	THE OTHER THING THAT'S COOL ABOUT USING THIS YOU CAN DO VERIFIED USERS SO AGAIN THOSE ARE LIKE THE MORE
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00002	SO NEXT UP WE HAVE DR WENSON THERE UH HE LEADS THE HARVARD NMC FSS COLLABORATION UH WITH DR RON THOMKINS
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00003	HE'S AH ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR AT IN SURGERY AND BIO PHARMACEUTICS AT HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL AND
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00004	HE'S A MEMBER OF THE SCIENTIFIC ADVISORY BOARD AT OMF HE DIRECTS THE MGH INFLATION AND METABOLISM COMPUTATIONAL CENTER AND HE ALSO LEADS THE COMPUTATIONAL GENOMICS GROUP AT STANFORD
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00005	AS WELL SO HE'S A VERY BUSY MAN HE'S GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE OPEN DATA SHARING PLATFORM THANK YOU VERY MUCH WENSLOW
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00007	THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING UM A LITTLE BIT SHORT OF TIME SO I'LL TRY TO GO THROUGH THE SLIDES QUICKLY AND WE CAN END BY THREE FORTY FIVE TO BE ON SCHEDULE
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00009	FOR THE NEXT TEN TO FIFTEEN MINUTES I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT UH WHAT DATA IS AVAILABLE UM ON THE WEBSITE AS OF OPEN MEDICINE FOUNDATION AND UH UH WHAT WE ARE
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00010	WORKING WITH COLLABORATORS AND PRACTICALLY EVERYONE IN THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY TO LOOK AT THIS DATA AND WHAT HAS BEEN DONE AND WHAT'S IN THE WORKS
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00011	SO AS WE HAVE HEARD UM QUITE A FEW TALKS THIS AFTERNOON ABOUT THE SIGNS UH BEHIND CFS AND WE KNOW THAT AS A COMPLEX DISEASE
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00012	THERE ARE MANY POTENTIAL REASONS AS CAUSES OF M C F AS FROM GENES TO INFECTIONS TO THE ENVIRONMENT SO IN ORDER TO
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00014	FIND THE POTENTIAL CAUSES OF CFS AND PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY FIND THE TREATMENTS FOR PATIENTS WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO LOOK
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00015	EVERYWHERE FOR THE CLUES AND AS RONG AND OTHER UM EXPERTS ALREADY MENTIONED BECAUSE OF THE LITTLE FUNDING AVAILABLE TO MECFS
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00016	UNFORTUNATELY MOST OF THE STUDIES TODAY ONLY CAN LOOK AT ONE OR TWO ASPECTS OF IN ALL THE THING AMONG ALL THE THINGS AND A SMALL
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00017	A GROUP OF PATIENTS THEREFORE THE FINDINGS FROM EACH INDIVIDUAL STUDIES NEED TO BE COMPARED SO YOU CAN FIND A RIGOROUS SIGNAL
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00018	AND DATA COLLECTED FROM DIFFERENT LEVELS FOR EXAMPLE MEASURING GENES VERSUS MEASURING INFECTIONS NEED TO BE INTEGRATED
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00019	SO WE CAN FIND SOMETHING CALLED A A CHAIN OF EVIDENCE UM THAT COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD US TO THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE SO WE HAVE HEARD ENOUGH OF THIS UM AND BECAUSE OF THIS
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00021	EARLY ON OF THE MEDICINE FOUNDATION UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF DR ANDREW DAVIS ADOPTED THIS UH POLICY UH OF OPEN DATA
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00023	WHICH MEANS THAT AS SOON AS PRETTY MUCH AS SOON AS A EXPERIMENT IS DONE UH WE TRY TO PUT DATA ON THE INTERNET
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00024	AND SHARE WITH RESEARCHERS IN THE COMMUNITY BASICALLY ALL OVER THE WORLD
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00025	AND WHO YOU KNOW WHOEVER REGISTERS ON THIS WEBSITE CAN SEE THE RAW DATA AND THE TYPE OF FINDINGS UM THAT HAVE BEEN UH STUDIED
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00027	BY OUR OWN TEAM AND OFTEN THEY WOULD TELL US WHAT ARE THE FINDINGS THAT WE PERHAPS ARE MISSING OR THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION OF THE RESULTS
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00028	SO I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF THE TIME I WOULD ONLY BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU SORT OF A COUPLE OF GLIMPSES OF WHAT'S ON THE WEBSITE
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00030	UM SO THIS IS UM THE SORT OF THE FRONT END UH OF THE WEBSITE IT'S UH AND I'M C I'M SEEING AS A STANFORD STUDENT DO YOU AT THE MOMENT WE'LL HAVE ANOTHER MIRROR SITE ON THE HARVARD DOMAIN SOON
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00031	SO THE AS YOU CAN SEE HERE EACH STUDY IS SEPARATED INTO DIFFERENT LEVELS BASED ON THE TYPE OF THE STUDY EITHER THE CLINICAL INFORMATION OF THE PATIENTS
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00032	OR THE CLINICAL LAPTOPS OF THE PATIENTS OR THE DIFFERENT TYPE OF MOLECULAR MEASUREMENTS GENES PROTEINS METABOLITES MICROBIOME ETC
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00033	SO THE DATA ARE SEPARATED INTO DIFFERENT LEVELS AND THEN UM WE WOULD COMPARE THE PATIENTS AS A GROUP WITH THE CONTROLS AND THAT RESULTS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE ON THE WEBSITE FOR PEOPLE TO STUDY
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00034	AND PERHAPS MORE INTERESTINGLY WE WOULD LIKE TO INTEGRATE DATA FROM DIFFERENT LEVELS TOGETHER
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00035	SO IF YOU HAVE A GIN UH AS APPEARS TO BE ABNORMAL IN ONE PATIENT YOU WOULD WANT TO SEE WHETHER THE PROTEIN THAT'S CAUSED BY THIS GIN IS ALSO AFFECTED
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00036	AND WHETHER THE FUNCTION OF THAT PROTEIN IS INDEED IMPAIRED IN THE PATIENT
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00037	SO JUST AS AN EXAMPLE UM OBVIOUSLY THIS TAKES A LOT OF PEOPLE'S WORK AND AND THAT'S A LIST OF
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00038	PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTED TO THIS WEBSITE SO THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE UH OOPS HERE UH YOU CAN SEE
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00040	THAT PARTICULAR PATIENT AND THIS IS THE PARTICULAR TEST THAT ONE CAN CHOOSE AND THAT'S THE PARTICULAR THRESHOLD UM OF FUTURING
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00041	SO YOU CAN CHOOSE WHAT YOU WANT TO SEE AND THIS SHOWS THESE RESULTS THIS HAPPEN TO BE A A SIGNIFICANT DATA OF ONE PARTICULAR PATIENT
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00042	AND HE OR SHE HAD TWO NORMAL TESTS IN TERMS OF THEIR IN TERMS OF THE PATIENTS CYTOKINE LEVELS SO THESE ARE THE PATIENT GROUPS THESE ARE THE CONTROL GROUPS
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00043	AND THIS TRIANGLE INDICATES THE LEVEL OF THE PATIENT SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS PARTICULAR PATIENT HAS MUCH LOWER
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00044	LEVEL OF THIS SYSTEM WHICH WE CALL THE BRAIN DERIVED A NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR WHICH IS INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF NEUROLOGICAL DISEASES AS A BIOMARKER FOR SOME OF THOSE DISEASES
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00045	SO THIS PATIENT HAS YOU KNOW REALLY LOW LEVEL UM NOT ONLY COMPARING TO THE CONTROLS
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00046	BUT ALSO COMPARING TO OTHER PATIENTS SO THAT'S POTENTIALLY THE VALUE THAT WE WANT TO GATHER FROM THIS TYPE OF PLATFORM AND SIMILARLY UM THE OTHER ONE WHICH IS C D FORTY L MARINE
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00047	TALKED ABOUT THE FUNCTIONS OF T CELLS CD FOUR IS ONE OF THOSE UH CYTOKINES THAT THAT WOULD AFFECT
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00048	AND HERE YOU SEE THAT BETWEEN PATIENT BETWEEN PATIENT GROUPS AND CONTROL GROUP THERE'S ACTUALLY NO DIFFERENCE HOWEVER THE LEVEL OF THIS PARTICULAR PATIENT
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00049	FOR THIS PARTICULAR SIDE OF KIND IS MUCH LOWER SO I HOPE THAT WHILE WE GROW ENOUGH NUMBER OF THIS KIND OF OBSERVATIONS PEOPLE CAN START TO UH LINK THINGS TOGETHER
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00051	AND UM THIS IS JUST OUR CURRENT ATTEMPT OF DOING SO UM SO
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00053	SO EACH ROW HERE IS IS ONE PHENOTYPE FOR EXAMPLE SLEEP PROBLEMS UH COGNITIVE TEST PROBLEMS PAIN FATIGUE ETC OBVIOUSLY WE MEASURED A LOT OF THOSE
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00054	AND EACH ROW HERE IS THE CORRELATION OF ONE OF THE ANALYTES AT DIFFERENT LEVELS
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00055	THAT'S SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH ANY OF THESE SYMPTOMS OF PATIENTS SO THE REDISH COLOR SHOWS POSITIVE CORRELATION WITH THE MOLECULE
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00056	AND THE BLUEISH COLOR SHOWED UM NEGATIVE CORRELATION AND AS WE HEARD FROM THE CLINICIANS UM EARLY ON UH SINCE THERE'S YOU KNOW A RATHER LARGE HETEROGENEITY AMONG DIFFERENT PATIENTS
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00057	THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE WANT TO DO THIS TYPE OF ANALYSIS TO SEE WHAT ARE THE INDICATORS THAT WOULD BE MOST CORRELATED WITH A PARTICULAR TYPE OF A SYMPTOM OF THE PATIENTS
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00059	YEAH SO THIS IS THE GROUPS PHYSICAL FUNCTIONS COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS AND AND SLEEP PROBLEMS
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00061	UM SO THESE ARE GENE RESULTS AS WELL ALREADY MENTIONED UM WE TRY TO SEQUENCE THE HORMONES OF OF PATIENTS AS MUCH AS WE CAN
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00062	AND ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF THAT AROUND THE MENTIONED ONE OF THE FINDINGS
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00063	BUT YEAH THE THE THE OTHER WAY OF LOOKING AT THE DATA WOULD BE THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY FIND THOSE RARE PATHOGENIC VARIANTS UH IN EACH PATIENT YOU KNOW REALISTICALLY FOR MOST OF US WE HAVE YOU KNOW
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00064	PATHOGENIC VARIANTS ONE OF THE OTHER THE QUESTION MORE IS THAT WHETHER THOSE VARIANTS CONTRIBUTE OR POTENTIALLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE DISEASE SO JUST AS AN EXAMPLE HERE
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00066	CFTR WHICH IS THUS WHICH IS CYSTIC FIBROSIS
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00068	GENE AND YOU CAN SEE THAT UH THERE ARE TWO UH WE CALL HETERODIMERS VARIANT THERE BECAUSE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THIS IS ONE OF THOSE VARIANTS COMMON IN IN IN THE COCAINE POPULATION
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00069	PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY WE SEE ACTUALLY A LOT OF THESE VARIANTS THAT ARE KNOWN TO BE INVOLVED IN
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00070	POTENTIALLY NEUROLOGICAL DISEASES SO BECAUSE OF TIME I'LL JUST TO SHOW YOU A ROUGH COMPARISON SO WHAT THIS IS IS TO ASK THE QUESTION
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00071	IF YOU LOOK AT THE PATHWAYS OF THOSE VARIANTS I SHOWED YOU IN THE PREVIOUS SLIDE AND ASK
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00073	WHAT HAVE BEEN DONE ON THESE VARIANTS IN THE STUDY OF OTHER DISEASES FOR EXAMPLE IN PAIN IN SLEEP DISTURBANCE IN COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT AND TO OUR SURPRISE
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00074	AS YOU CAN SEE HERE UH MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF THE VARIANTS THAT ARE SHOWED TO YOU ARE ACTUALLY KNOWN TO BE INVOLVED IN ALL THOSE SYMPTOMS
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00075	SO SINCE WE ONLY LOOK AT FEW PATIENTS AS AS HARVARD MENTIONED THESE WERE SEVERELY ILL PATIENTS IN THIS PARTICULAR STUDY RESOLVED THAT WE SHOULD
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00076	YOU KNOW TEST WHETHER IT'S THE ACCIDENTAL FINDINGS WE USED TO UK BIOBANK DATA THERE THEY HAVE A SOMEWHERE AROUND THE TWO THREE THOUSAND
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00077	CF HAS PATIENCE AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IF WE TAKE THEIR DATA
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00079	AND WE WOULD GET A WEAKER BUT STILL UH SIGNIFICANT SIGNAL THERE SO UM JUST GIVE YOU UH SOME UH CLUE UM OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00080	AND YOU KNOW TRYING TO SEE WHETHER WE CAN USE THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00081	TO IDENTIFY THE CORE POTENTIAL CAUSE OF THE DISEASE UM AS WELL AS UM TRYING TO BORROW STRENGTH
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00082	FROM STUDIES OF OTHER DISEASES THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL FOR TREATING UH ME CFS PATIENTS ONE DAY NOW BECAUSE OF THE TIME
YTB+FWDxSlpDTuw+00084	I'LL PROBABLY JUST STOP HERE
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00002	GOOD MORNING EVERYONE GOOD MORNING IT'S I'M GOING TO MOVE AWAY FROM HERE IT'S ABSOLUTELY LOVELY TO SEE YOU ALL THIS MORNING UM AND I THOUGHT WHAT I WOULD DO IS JUST TO SAY A FEW WORDS OF WELCOME AND THANK YOU

YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00004	BECAUSE IT WAS FANTASTIC UH TO SEE AT THE END OF WHAT WAS A A LONG AND FULL DAY OF CONTENT TO SEE SO MUCH NETWORKING AND FRIENDSHIPS GOING ON BOTH IN THE ROOM OUTSIDE AND ELSEWHERE
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00005	I ALSO WANT TO AND IMPORTANTLY SAY AS WE ENTER OUR SECOND DAY OF THIS CONFERENCE THANK YOU AGAIN TO ALL OUR SUPPORTERS AND TO OUR PARTNERS AND EXHIBITORS
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00006	AND ESPECIALLY OUR PLATFORM SPONSOR IN GENEVA AND ALSO TO OUR ASK OUR NON COMMERCIAL SPONSORS AS WELL
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00008	I ALSO UM AT THIS STAGE HAVE UH WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK UM OUR FRIENDS FROM
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00010	THE A V COMPANY QUADRANT IT IS FABULOUS WE WORKED WITH THEM FOR FOUR OR FIVE CONFERENCES NOW
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00011	AND WHATEVER ELSE IS GOING ON WHATEVER PANICS GOING ON ABOUT COVID TESTS AND PEOPLE NOT COMING YOU CAN RELY ENTIRELY ON THE FACT THAT THE VIDEO IS GOING TO WORK THE GRAPHICS ARE WORK AND THE MICROPHONES
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00014	I JUST HAVE TO DO THAT I HAVE TO DO THAT I'M SORRY AND I KNOW I DO IT EVERY YEAR BUT I HAVE TO DO UH SO THANK YOU I'M JUST GOING TO SPEND A COUPLE OF MINUTES UM TELLING YOU ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TODAY
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00015	AND THE FIRST OF WHICH IS THAT UH I'M GOING TO INTRODUCE OUR CHAIR FOR THE DAY IN A FEW MINUTES AND THAT'S PROFESSOR SIR TERENCE STEVENSON WHO'S CHAIR OF THE HEALTH RESEARCH AUTHORITY
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00016	AND HE'S GOING TO NAVIGATE OUR WAY THROUGH UH THIS MORNING SESSION AND THAT MORNING THIS MORNING SESSION STARTS AS STRONG AS YESTERDAY
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00017	WHERE WE HAVE UM RICHARD MURRAY THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE KING'S FUND TO TAKE US IN OUR HELICOPTER UP TO SIXTY THOUSAND FEET UM KEITH CANNON SAYING HELICOPTERS WON'T GO TO SIXTY THOUSAND FEET THEY'LL CRASH DOWN BUT HE'LL PROBABLY TELL ME THAT LATER
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00018	AND THEN WE'RE DELIGHTED TO HAVE PROFESSOR ANDREW GODARD BOD TO COME AND GIVE HIS VIEW OF THE FRONT LINE
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00020	ABOUT THE NHS AND THEN FINALLY UH KEITH CONRADY IN POSSIBLY ONE OF HIS LAST PUBLIC APPEARANCES AS CHIEF INVESTIGATING OFFICER OF THE HEALTHCARE SAFETY INVESTIGATION BRANCH OR H SIB
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00021	AS IT'S KNOWN AND MAYBE HE MAY TELL US WHY IT'S HC BUT NOT HSIB BUT WHO KNOWS
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00023	THEN WE CHANGE
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00025	EVER SO SLIGHTLY BECAUSE YESTERDAY ON THIS STAGE WAS VERY ENGLAND FOCUS BUT AS ANN SAID WHEN SHE WELCOMED US YESTERDAY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT GS AND UK HAS DONE OVER THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00026	IS ACTUALLY HAVE A FOCUS ON THE UK BIT
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00027	AND THERE ARE DELIGHTFULLY UM NATIONAL PROGRAMS NOW IN SCOTLAND AND WALES AND NORTHERN IRELAND AND WE'RE DELIGHTED TO HAVE UM COLLEAGUES FROM SCOTLAND AND WALES TO JOIN US TODAY AND TALK THROUGH THAT
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00028	WE HAVE STEVE BUSH ON STAGE LATER TO TALK ABOUT HIS MEDICAL DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS AT LEEDS AND AS YOU KNOW LEEDS WAS ONE OF THE
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00030	AND WE'VE BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE SCAN FOR SAFETY PROGRAM AND HE'S GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW LEADS ARE MOVING ON FROM THAT AND WHAT ELSE THEY'RE UP TO UM THEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A BREAK
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00031	AND THEN WE'D COME COME BACK AND TALK ABOUT UH DATA AND ONE THIS WHOLE THING ABOUT IF YOU IF YOU'RE SCANNING THINGS SCANNING IS GOOD BUT IF YOU GET DATA
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00032	ALL YOU'RE GETTING IS ONE SCAN IS ONE BEEP MILLIONS OF SCANS GIVES YOU INSIGHT AND HOW WE'RE ABLE TO USE THAT INSIGHT BUILDING ON SOME OF THE SOME OF THE SORT OF CONVERSATIONS WE HAD YESTERDAY
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00033	AND THEN FINALLY ON THIS STAGE FOR THE MORNING BEFORE LUNCH UH CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND GODFREY WILL COME AND GIVE A SUMMARY OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER THE FIRST DAY AND A HALF
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00034	WE'RE THEN GOING TO MAKE THE BREAKOUT STAGES THERE WAS SUCH HUGE CONTENT YESTERDAY ON THE BREAKOUT STAGES SO HERE YOU HEAR THE BIG PICTURE AND THEN WE GO INTO DETAIL AND IMPLEMENTATION AND PROCESS ON THOSE STAGES
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00035	AND WHERE WE HAVE THIS AFTERNOON AFTER AN EARLY LUNCH WE HAVE ON THE DHL STAGE THE SCAN FOR SAFETY AND THE FUTURE THE NATIONAL SCAN FOR SAFETY PROGRAMME ARE MORE DETAIL AND MORE DATA FROM WALES AND SCOTLAND
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00037	SUSTAINABILITY ON HCSA THE NHS TALKS ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY NET ZERO TWENTY FORTY OR TWENTY FIFTY UM
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00038	AND WE'VE GOT SOME REALLY INTERESTING UM PRESENTATIONS ON THAT STAGE UH LED BY A DAVID LAWSON WHO IS FROM GUYS AND TOMMY'S
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00039	AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE SEEN MOST OVER THE LAST PROBABLY EIGHTEEN MONTHS AT GS ONE UK IS THE MOVE TO USING GS ONE STANDARDS IN A
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00040	VERY STRONG WAY FOR ASSET MANAGEMENT AND THAT'S ABSOLUTELY BEEN SOMETHING THAT'S A COVID A COVID THING SO WE'VE GOT IT ON THE ON THE SCANDIUM STAGE WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00042	SO UM LAST THING FROM ME BEFORE TERRENCE STEPS UP
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00044	IS TO REMIND YOU OF OUR OF OUR CHARITY TO REMIND YOU THAT WE WILL BE SENDING OUT FEEDBACK FORMS FOR YOU TO FILL IN AND FOR EACH FEEDBACK FORM WE RECEIVE UM AS I MENTIONED YESTERDAY
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00045	GS ONE UK WILL DONATE FIVE POUNDS UH TO THE DEC FOR SUPPORTING HUMANITARIAN RELIEF IN UKRAINE AND WE HAVE THAT LOVELY QR CODE THAT YOU CAN JUST SNAP AND MAKE A DIRECT DONATION TO
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00046	SO THAT'S IT FROM ME UM ENJOY ASK QUESTIONS LET'S YOU KNOW HAVE THAT UM REAL INTERACTIVE PARTICIPATIVE EVENT THAT WE HAD YESTERDAY AGAIN
YTB+IECFh2ZpWtI+00047	AND WITHOUT FURTHER ADO I'D LIKE TO INVITE PROFESSOR SIR TERENCE STEVENSON TO COME AND CHAIR THIS MORNING'S SESSION TERENCE THANK YOU
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00002	SO UM WHO HEARS AN ADDICT
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00004	ALL RIGHT I LOVE YOU ALREADY SO UM
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00006	THIS IS A DREAM I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY THIS IS AMAZING SO MY MOM STARTED A RECOVERY ABOUT THIRTY YEARS AGO SHE'S WHY I'M HERE SO YOU'LL HEAR HER A BIT AS AS WE GO THROUGH THIS TALK SO WHO'S HEARD A RELAPSE PREVENTION
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00008	WHO THINKS THAT SOUNDS AWFUL I JUST IT'S JUST COLD YOU KNOW AND SO WE WANTED TO BRING LIFE TO RECOVERY LIKE WHO WANTS TO RECOVER IF IT'S NOT FUN
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00009	YOU KNOW AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE DO WE BRING THIS LIKE BRIGHT LIGHT TO RECOVERY AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT OUR GOAL IS SO WE CAME UP WITH RECOVERY PROTECTION AND IT'S A DIFFERENT APPROACH AND I THINK IT GIVES PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENJOY
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00010	PREVENTING A RELAPSE RIGHT BECAUSE IF IT'S NOT FUN ARE WE GOING TO DO IT WHY DIDN'T WE DO DRUGS RIGHT BECAUSE THEY CHANGED THE WAY WE THOUGHT AND WE FELT
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00011	THAT'S WHY I DID THEM ACTUALLY AERIC CLAPTON WAS INTERVIEWED IN SIXTY MINUTES AND THE GUY INTERVIEWING HIM SAID SO HERO WAS YOUR FIRST DRUG AND HE SAYS NO WAS SUGAR I WAS FIVE YEARS OLD
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00012	BREAD AND BUTTER WITH SUGAR AND WAFFERS AND RUSSELL BRAND TALKS ABOUT THE CHOCOLATE WAFFERS WHEN HE WAS A KID IN HIS BOOK RECOVERY IT'S THIS IS A DRUG AND WE NEED TO TREAT IT LIKE A DRUG
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00013	SO I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU THROUGH A STACKABLE THREE TOOL SYSTEM AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO DO SOME WORK TOGETHER SO YOU'LL FIND CARDS STACK OF CARDS IN THE IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00014	IF YOU CAN'T FIND KAREN SHE'S GOT HER HANDS UP SHE'S GOT SOME EXTRAS OVER THERE AND WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING SOMETHING TOGETHER SO WE'RE GOING TO DO SOME WORK
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00015	BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S THE THE WORK IS WHAT IT GIVES US THE FREEDOM SO THE FIRST THING WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IS A TRIGGER FREE TRIANGLE SO WE CAME UP WITH THIS TO HELP PEOPLE FIRST IDENTIFY THE FOODS THAT ARE TRIGGERS FOR THEM BUT IT ACTUALLY CAN GO MUCH DEEPER THAN THAT SO WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT DEBATE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00016	WHO'S EVER HAD WHO'S BEEN IN AN ICE CREAM GROCERY STORE AND EVER DEBATED
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00018	COME ON WHERE ARE THE HANDS THERE THEY ARE ALL RIGHT AND THEY'RE RUNNING WHO'S BEEN IN THE ISLE IN THE GROCERY STORE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00019	AND YOUR DRUG FOOD WONDERING SHOULD I OR SHOULDN'T I RIGHT AND WE DON'T TALK ABOUT ROMANCE THAT LONGING THAT LUST THE RENDEZVOUS HAVE YOU EVER EATEN FOOD AND HIDDEN THEM IN THE TRASH
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00020	OR JUST IT'S IT'S LIKE A LUSTFUL THING RIGHT AND THE GUILT THAT FOLLOWS THE DRUG RIGHT HOW LONG DOES THE PLEASURE REALLY LAST
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00021	IF YOU'RE A LATE STAGE ADDICT LIKE ME NOT LONG AND THEN YOU'RE RIGHT INTO THE GUILT SO BASICALLY
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00023	WHAT WE CAN DO IS WE CAN USE THESE THINGS TO IDENTIFY THE THINGS THAT ARE DANGEROUS FOR US SO IF SHOULD I EAT IT SHOULD I NOT EAT IT THAT DEADLY QUESTION RIGHT SO I HATE TO BREAK IT TO YOU THE ANSWERS NO
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00025	YOU SHOULDN'T EAT IT RIGHT AND THE ROMANCE THE PLANNING I WENT TO NASHVILLE LIKE FIVE YEARS AGO AND EVERY SINGLE ITEM ON MY ITINERARY WAS ABOUT FOOD
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00026	EVERY PLACE I WENT WAS ABOUT FOOD BECAUSE I'M AN ADDICT THAT'S WHAT I DO SO IT BECOMES AS INGRAINED IN HOW WE THINK AND HOW WE LIVE AND THE GUILT
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00027	DOES IT MAKE YOU FEEL ASHAMED DOES IT MAKE YOU FEEL WORTHLESS OR LIKE A FAILURE IF IT DOES IT'S A DRUG
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00028	SO BASICALLY DEBATE IS PLAYING WITH MATCHES ROMANCE IS SEEING HOW CLOSE YOU CAN GET TO THE FLAMES AND GUILT IS GETTING BURNED WHO'S BEEN BURNED BEFORE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00029	IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BURN YOU FOLKS IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE WE FORGET AND THAT'S WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT TO GO THROUGH
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00030	SO JUST HERE REALLY QUICK DEBATE ASKING YOURSELF SHOULD I SHOULDN'T I ROMANCE THE PLANNING IN ADVANCE THE RENDEZVOUS
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00032	AND GUILT THAT WORTHLESS SENSE OF FAILURE AFTER WE'VE DONE IT SO THAT'S THE FIRST TOOL THAT'S THE TRIGGER FREE TRIANGLE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00034	THE THREE P'S AND THIS GOES DOWN ON MY MOM AND NOW MY MY GRANDMOTHER WAS DYING SHE WAS ON HER DEATHBED SHE WAS ON A PALLET OF CARE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00036	AND I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND MY MOM'S GETTING READY TO GO SO WE CAN WATCH HER PASS
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00038	AND SHE GETS A COOLER
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00040	A COUPLE ICE PACKS STARTS WEIGHING AND MEASURING YOUR VEGETABLES AND YOUR MEATS LIKE WHAT ARE YOU DOING
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00042	SHE SAYS I'M PROTECTING MY RECOVERY
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00044	WOW THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES GUYS SO WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS IT GOING TO BE FOR YOU TO PROTECT YOUR RECOVERY YOU DON'T NEED TO PROTECT MY RECOVERY I DO YOU NEED TO PROTECT YOUR RECOVERY SO IT COMES WITH THE PLANNING
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00045	PREPARING AND PROTECTING WE'RE GOING TO WALK THROUGH THESE STREETS BECAUSE YOU REALLY UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF IT OKAY IF YOU FAIL TO PLAN YOU ARE PLANNING TO FAIL
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00046	IF YOU DON'T DO THE STEPS THAT YOU NEED TO DO TO GET TO WHERE YOU WANT TO BE YOU CAN'T GET THERE IT'S THAT SIMPLE YOU DON'T GO ON A ROAD TRIP WITHOUT PUTTING GAS IN YOUR CAR DO YOU
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00047	IT'S THE SAME THING YOU'RE GOING TO GET AN OIL CHANGE YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE WIPERS ARE CLEAR RIGHT YOU'RE GOING TO GET READY FOR YOUR TRIP AND YOU'RE GOING TO PREPARE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00048	YOU'RE GOING TO PACK UP YOUR CAR YOU'RE GOING TO PUT IN YOUR SUITCASE YOU'RE GOING TO REMEMBER YOUR TOILETRIES YOU'RE GOING TO DO ALL THESE THINGS AND THAT'S GOING TO PROTECT YOUR EXPERIENCE ON YOUR TRIP IT'S GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN YOU GET THERE YOU HAVE WHAT YOU NEED TO DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00049	WHICH IS HOPEFULLY TO HAVE A GOOD TIME SO
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00051	SO TO PREPARE IS TO MAKE READY OR ABLE TO DEAL WITH OR DO SOMETHING RIGHT IT'S THE STEPS THAT WE NEED TO TAKE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT BECOMES POSSIBLE FOR US TO ENGAGE IN THE ACTIVITIES THAT WILL ENSURE THAT WE PROTECT OUR RECOVERY
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00053	FEEL LIKE THIS ONE MISSING HERE YOU KNOW SO I MISSED A PLAN PLANNING IS VERY IMPORTANT YOU CAN'T PREPARE WITHOUT A PLAN IT'S LIKE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE HEARD GEORGE PETERSON TALK ABOUT THE STUPID PLAN WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF THIS STUFF IN IN THE VILLAGE THAT I RUN RIGHT
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00054	A STUPID PLAN IS YOU FIGURE OUT WHERE YOU WANT TO GO AND THEN YOU SIT FOR FIVE MINUTES AND YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE THE STEPS THAT YOU NEED TO DO TO GET THERE YOU DON'T NEED TO BE RIGHT
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00055	YOU JUST NEED TO DO WHAT YOU SAID YOU'RE GOING TO DO AND THEN YOU FAIL SPECIFICALLY YOU'LL SUCCEED SPECIFICALLY AND YOU ADJUST YOUR PLAN SO THE PLAN ISN'T SET IN STONE IT'S THE BEST IDEA THAT YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW AND THEN YOU ENGAGE IN THAT PLAN
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00057	AND THAT GOES TO THE PREPARATION WHICH WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT SORRY OUT OF ORDER BUT TOO EXCITED AND THEN THAT ENABLES YOU TO PROTECT YOUR RECOVERY ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON BUILDING UP UNTIL NOW
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00058	THAT IS THE POINT
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00060	OKAY NOW SO WE WE KNOW ABOUT THE TRIANGLE WE KNOW ABOUT THE THREE C'S ARE REALLY IS KIND OF ARE TAKE ON A SORT OF A C B T BASED
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00061	MODEL BUT IT'S BASICALLY WHAT TRIGGERS YOU WHAT YOU DO WHAT HAPPENS
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00063	BECAUSE USUALLY AS ADDICTS IF YOU WERE ANYTHING LIKE ME WELL YOU HAD A CUE AND THEN YOU USED YOUR DRUG
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00064	AND THEN HE HAD A RESULT AS A RESULT OF EATING THE DRUG WHICH USUALLY STUNK RIGHT IT WASN'T WHERE HE WANTED TO BE SO BY BREAKING IT DOWN THIS WAY WE CAN SEE THAT THE CUE IS A STIMULUS THAT SETS OFF THE EVENT
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00065	THE CUSTOM IS WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU'RE TRIGGERED RIGHT AND THE CONSEQUENCE IS THE RESULT OF WHAT HAPPENS AFTER YOU'VE DONE THE BEHAVIOR OR THE SUBSTANCE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00066	THAT'S YOUR CUE RIGHT SO A CUE COULD BE ANYTHING LIKE UM BELIEVE IT OR NOT I WAS TRAINED AS AN ARTIST BREAD BAKER NOT SO HELPFUL AS AN ADJUST BUT THE UM THE POINT IS THAT MY WIFE WAS IN THE KITCHEN AND SHE WAS LIKE SPLAPPING BUTTER ACROSS TOAST
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00067	AND I WORK RIGHT NEXT TO THE KITCHEN AND I'M LIKE I'M LIKE I'M FRIGGERED I'M LIKE TRYING TO WORK I'M LIKE HELPING ADDISON LIKE HERE LIKE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00068	RIGHT SO IT COULD BE A SOUND IT COULD BE A SMELL IT COULD BE A TIME OF DAY IT COULD BE A PLACE COULD BE A PERSON COULD BE ANYTHING SO WE REALLY NEED TO BE ON GUARD FOR THIS STUFF AND REALLY TAKE AN INVENTORY
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00069	OF WHAT ARE OUR CUES RIGHT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE PERSONAL TO US
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00071	AND SO WE HAVE TO BE GRATEFUL FOR OUR TRIGGERS
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00073	BOTTOM LINE THEY GIVE US INFORMATION BIT AND TALKED ABOUT THAT WHAT DOES A RELAPSE GIVE YOU IT GIVES YOU INFORMATION THEN YOU CAN BECOME RESPONSIBLE TO DO SOMETHING BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00074	RIGHT THAT'S EMPOWERING THAT'S RECOVERY
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00076	THAT'S THE REPEATED THING THAT YOU'VE DONE RIGHT DOING THE SAME THING YOU'VE ALWAYS DONE AND THEN YOU END UP WITH THE OH GIVES THEN YOU END UP WITH THE SAME RESULTS
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00078	THAT'S MY ALARM TO WAKE MY KIDS UP
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00080	BELIEVE IT OR NOT THERE'S ANOTHER ONE OF FIFTEEN MINUTES AND I'LL GET THERE IN A SECOND SO BASICALLY LOOK AT THIS TIME OF DAY RIGHT LOTS OF PEOPLE GET TIRED AROUND THREE PM
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00081	CHEAPEST THAT'S RIGHT ABOUT NOW ISN'T IT SO WHAT DO WE DO WELL SOME OF YOU PROBABLY GOT SOME COFFEE OR SOME TEA RIGHT WE GET A FIX WE GET SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE THE WAY WE THINK OR FEEL RIGHT AND THEN WHAT'S THE CONSEQUENCE MAYBE FEEL
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00083	MAYBE YOU'RE SAYING TO YOURSELF GOD WHY DID I DO THAT AGAIN I KNEW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN AND I DID IT ANYWAY
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00084	SO RIGHT WE CAN CHANGE THE CUSTOM AND THEN WE CAN CHANGE THE CONSEQUENCE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00085	SO INSTEAD OF GRABBING A FIX WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A WALK OUTSIDE WHY DON'T YOU GET YOURSELF A NATURE DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND YOU'LL GET SOMETHING DIFFERENT OKAY
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00087	BECAUSE WHEN YOU CHANGE YOUR CUSTOM YOU CHANGE YOUR CONSEQUENCE AND WHEN YOU CHANGE YOUR CONSEQUENCES YOU CHANGE YOUR LIFE AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO DO RIGHT YOU CAN'T LIVE THE WAY YOU LIVED BEFORE IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00089	SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO PLAY RIGHT UM SO WE DO A LOT OF THIS IN CIRCLE IT'S CALLED UM CALL WORKING ALONE TOGETHER SO I WANT YOU TO GO AHEAD AND GRAB YOUR CARDS
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00090	OKAY YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT ACTUALLY BEFORE YOU DO THAT JUST GRAB A BLANK PIECE OF PAPER
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00092	OR BELIEVE IT OR NOT AS SOON AS I HIT THIS ARROW TIMER IS GOING TO START YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SIXTY SECONDS TO DO THIS
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00094	SO THIS IS THE PROMPT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE FOR THE TIME EXERCISE YOU'RE GOING TO SAY TO YOURSELF I KNOW MY RECOVERY IS IN TROUBLE WHEN I DOT DOT DOT
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00095	YOU'RE JUST GOING TO BLAST OFF ANSWERS AS FAST AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN ON THE BLANK PAPER YES NOTHING'S RIGHT NOTHING'S WRONG
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00096	IT'S JUST YOUR RECOVERY AND WHEN YOU KNOW IT'S IN TROUBLE SO WHEN A WAY FOR THIS FOLKS TO SIT DOWN IN CASE THEY DIDN'T HAVE IT
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00097	THEN READY FIVE FOUR THREE TWO ONE ALREADY GOT A MINUTE I'M GOING TO SHUT UP
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00099	IT'S NOT PLAYING
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00101	IT'S A PDF I'LL JUST USE MY TIMER
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00103	IT'S A SORRY TO PDV SO I FORGOT SO
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00105	JUST KEEP GOING DON'T STOP AND LOOK AT THE TIMER
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00107	WE'LL GIVE IT TWENTY MORE SECONDS JUST KEEP WRITING TELL YOU TELL YOU CAN'T WRITE ANYMORE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00109	ALL RIGHT AS MY CLIENT AND AND AS MY COWORKER AND I WOULD SAY THIS IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR GOVERNMENT WORK SO WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON ALL RIGHT SO YOU'RE GOING TO PULL OUT YOUR CARDS
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00111	YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU SEE IN FRONT OF YOU THE TOP CARD HERE NOT THE BOTTOM SO THERE'S THERE'S TWO SIDES RIGHT SHOULD BE A ONE IN THE BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER OF YOUR CARD
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00113	OKAY NOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU THIRTY SECONDS YOU'RE JUST GOING TO PICK A CUE FROM YOUR LIST ONE THAT YOU FEEL YOU COULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT WOULD BE IDEAL
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00114	AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO WRITE IT IN THE CUE LINE ON THE FIRST SIDE AND ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE CARD SO ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PICK A CUE WRITE IT DOWN ON THE CUE LINE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE CARD
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00116	GIVE YOU THIRTY SECONDS TO DO THAT
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00118	IF YOU'RE DONE SHOW ME YOUR PEN
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00120	OR WE HAVE THERE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00122	DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PRETTY TO WORK THAT'S THE GOOD THING OKAY NOW THINK ABOUT YOUR CUE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00124	IS IT DEBATE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00126	IS IT GUILT OR IS IT ROMANCE MAYBE IT'S ALL THREE THAT'S OKAY JUST CIRCLE THE ONES THAT APPLY
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00128	IF YOU'RE NOT SURE CIRCLE THE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00130	TRUST YOUR GUT TOO
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00132	SOMETIMES WE OVERTHINK THINGS A LITTLE REPHRASED AS ACTS WE ALWAYS OVERTHINK THINGS
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00134	SO IT'S THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT A DICTION RIGHT IT IT'S REALLY PIRATING OUR MIND FROM AN INSTINCTIVE PART OF OUR BRAIN
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00135	SO WE REALLY HAVE TO TRUST OUR KNOWING TO KIND OF GET PAST THAT AND START TO BUILD THIS THE BLUE DOG WE'RE BITTEN WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT'S THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX THAT'S THE HUMAN BRAIN IT'S A VERY
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00136	A VERY CAPABLE PART OF OUR BRAIN BUT YOU CAN'T REACH IT IT'S USELESS TO YOU THAT'S WHY YOU CAN'T THINK YOUR WAY OUT OF A DICTION YOU HAVE TO WORK YOUR WAY OUT OF A DICTION YOU HAVE TO DO STUFF
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00137	OKAY
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00139	NOW THE CUSTOM SO WHEN YOU'RE IN YOUR CUE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00141	WHAT DO YOU NORMALLY DO
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00143	WHAT HAPPENS WHAT'S YOUR BEHAVIOR
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00145	NOT WHAT THE RESULT IS BUT WHAT IS THE THING YOU DO FOLLOWING YOUR CUE JUST WRITE IT DOWN
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00147	NO WRONG ANSWERS
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00149	AND NOW
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00151	WHAT'S THE RESULT OF THE BEHAVIOR THAT YOU'VE DONE THAT YOU'VE WRITTEN ON YOUR CARD WHERE DOES THAT TAKE YOU WHAT IS THE CONSEQUENCE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00153	HAVE TO DIG DEEP HERE IT'S NOT JUST THAT YOU DRUG OR THAT YOU
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00155	WHERE DOES THAT TAKE YOU WHAT KIND OF STATE ARE YOU IN WHAT IS YOUR THINKING LIKE WHAT ARE YOUR FEELINGS LIKE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00156	GET LIKE VISCERAL AND GUTSY AND BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO GO HERE RIGHT WE DON'T WANT TO GO BACK THERE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00158	PAIN IS THE THING THAT MOTIVATES US AS ADDICTS SOMETIMES GET INTO THAT THEY'LL TEACH YOU SOMETHING
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00160	ALL RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW FLIP YOUR CARD OVER RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO PLAY WITH THE THREE P'S A LITTLE BIT SO BASICALLY WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE YOU DO IS HOW WILL YOU PLAN HOW WILL YOU PREPARE AND HOW WILL YOU PROTECT
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00161	WHEN YOU GET THIS TRIGGER OR CUE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00163	BASICALLY WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00165	YOU CAN ALWAYS ELABORATE ON YOUR PLAN TOO BUT THE POINT IS THAT IF YOU HAVE A NUMBERED SYSTEM THAT YOU WOULD IMPLEMENT YOU WOULD JUST DO THOSE THINGS IN ORDER
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00166	AND THAT'S GOING TO TAKE YOU FURTHER AWAY FROM YOUR TRIGGER CLOSER TO YOUR RECOVERY RIGHT RELAPSE AND RECOVERY HAPPEN ON A ON A PARADIGM RIGHT YOU HAVE RECOVERY OVER HERE AND RELAPSE OVER HERE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00167	AND YOU HAVE TO WORK YOUR WAY AWAY FROM RECOVERY IN ORDER TO WORK YOUR WAY TOWARDS RELAPSE SO BY DOING THESE ACTIONS YOU'RE WORKING YOUR WAY FROM RELAPSE BACK TOWARDS RECOVERY BACK TO WHERE YOU WANT TO GO
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00169	IT'S POSSIBLE TO SOMEONE TO BE IN A RELAPSE FOR A VERY LONG TIME BEFORE THEY PICK UP A DRUG
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00171	HAPPENS MORE OFTEN THAN YOU THINK
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00173	THAT'S WHY WE WANT TO BE GOING BACKWARDS
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00175	ALL RIGHT SO YOU DID YOUR PLANNING YOU DID YOUR PLANNING PREPARING YOU DID YOUR PROTECTING
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00177	WHAT'S THE CONSEQUENCE OF THOSE THREE THINGS WHERE DOES THAT GET YOU HOW DO YOU FEEL WHAT STATE ARE YOU IN
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00179	WHAT ARE THE WORDS THAT YOU WOULD USE TO DESCRIBE WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00181	THIS IS THE REALITY FOLKS YOUR RECOVERY HAS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM YOUR ADDICTION CREATES IT'S THAT SIMPLE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00182	IT HAS TO SOLVE ALL OF THE PROBLEMS THAT YOUR ADDICTION CREATES AND GUESS WHAT YOUR RED DOG WILL MORE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00183	IT'LL DO WHATEVER IT HAS TO DO TO MAKE YOU MISERABLE NOT EVEN KILL YOU JUST MAKE YOU MISERABLE RIGHT SO WE NEED TO STAY ON TOP OF THIS AND THAT'S WHY THIS ISN'T SOMETHING YOU DO ONCE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00184	RIGHT I JUST RECENTLY MOVED I HAVE TWO YOUNG KIDS RIGHT I DON'T HAVE THE TRIGGERS I USED TO HAVE I HAVE A TWO YEAR OLD THREE YEAR OLD SHE DOESN'T PLAY INDEPENDENTLY
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00185	LIKE SHE DOESN'T WANT TO IT DRIVES ME NUTS LIKE THAT'S A TRIGGER THAT WASN'T A TRIGGER WHEN I DIDN'T HAVE A THREE YEAR OLD SO IT'S SOMETHING IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE LIKE SO CLOSE TO THE DRUG IT JUST CAN BE ANYTHING THAT YOU FEEL A LITTLE OFF ABOUT
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00186	AND BY TAKING AN INVENTORY YOU REALLY KNOW WHAT YOUR RECOVERY HAS TO BE MADE OF BECAUSE IF YOU MISS ONE OF THESE THINGS IT COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO RELAPSE RIGHT
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00187	RIGHT BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT PROTECTING YOUR RECOVERY SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE AN INVENTORY SO THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO TELL YOU IS THAT WE HAVE A FREE EVENT ACTUALLY STARTS ON MONDAY I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO BE THERE BECAUSE I'M GOING TO BE IN AN AIRPLANE
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00188	BASICALLY IT TAKES YOU THROUGH OUR SYSTEM AND THE FINAL DAY IS PRETTY MUCH THIS IT'S RECOVERY PROTECTION ONE OH ONE WE CALL IT STAYING STOPPED
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00189	SO IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR YOU'RE INTERESTED JUST FIND ME OR ONE OF MY PEOPLE AT THE TABLE OVER THERE THEY CAN GIVE YOU SOME INFORMATION AND I WANTED TO GIVE SOME TIME TO ANSWER QUESTIONS I KNOW THERE'S NOT A TON OF TIME LEFT BUT
YTB+LaXbkENZKgs+00190	UM SO SHOOT I GUESS
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00002	THANK YOU SO MUCH UH GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYBODY UH SO MY NAME INDEED IS UH DANIELLE BESANA AND I'M ANTICIPATED UH I'M PART OF AN INTERNATIONAL UH MICROSOFT TEAM
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00003	UM BUT WHOSE NAME IS A GLOBAL BLACK VELVET UM
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00004	WHO IS A FOCUS ON UH HELPING OUR CUSTOMERS UH UM TO GET THE MOST OUT OF THEIR IPERFORMANCE COMPUTING
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00005	WORK CLOTHES BY RUNNING THEM ON MICROSOFT AZURE CLOUD
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00006	UH TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO SPEND THE THE NEXT UH TEN UH MINUTES UM UH TOGETHER TO BRING YOU THROUGH SOME UH OF UH EXAMPLES UH
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00007	WE HAVE UM ABOUT UH OUR UH MICROSOFT THE EASURE UH TOGETHER WITH UH UM SPECIFIC PARTNERS UH UH CAN ACTUALLY BOOST UH IN SILICA MEDICINE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00008	UH FIRST OF ALL UH I WOULD LIKE TO START FROM UH UH DIVISION
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00009	BUT MICROSOFT UH AS UH ABOUT UH OUR MICROSOFT CAN ACTUALLY HELP UH IN A JOURNEY UH CUSTOMER JOURNEYS UH AND AND USER JOURNEYS UH RELATED TO WELLCARE AND LIVE SCIENCE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00010	AND THE IDEA IS ACTUALLY TO UH LET'S SAY MOVE AWAY UH FROM UH UH TRADITIONAL APPROACH
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00011	WHERE UH THE PASSIONATE PATIENT IS SOMEONE THAT IS BROUGHT THROUGH UH ALREADY WELL DEFINED THE PROCESSES
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00012	AND THE IDEA IS TO MOVE TO TO TO EMBRACE A VISION
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00013	WHERE THE PATIENT CAN ACTUALLY BE AT THE CENTER OF MULTIPLE PROCESSES OR MULTIPLE APPROACHES
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00014	AMONG THEM UM THERE ARE OTHER FOR EXAMPLE UH UH THE THE POSSIBILITY TO DEVELOP UH PERSONALIZED THE TREATMENTS
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00015	UM THE POSSIBILITY TO ENABLE EFFECTIVE CLINICAL TRIALS
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00016	WITH THE THE PURPOSE OF UH HELPING UH TO UM MAKE UH NEW DRUGS AVAILABLE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00017	IN SHORTER TIME FRAMES UH UH REDUCING COST UH AND UM UNLEASHING UH RESOURCES UH FOR ADDITIONAL RESEARCH
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00018	AND ALSO ALLOW UH WHAT HAS BECOME OVER THE LAST UH YEARS UH A TYPICAL APPROACH TO HAVE MULTIPLE UH RESEARCHER GROUPS UH UH COLLABORATING ACROSS THE GLOBE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00019	UM THE IDEA IS ACTUALLY TO HELP UH THOSE UM GROUPS TO TO BETTER WORK AND WORK MORE EFFECTIVELY TOGETHER
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00020	SO CLOUD IN GENERAL MAY BECOME BY DEFINITION UM A NEW APPROACH IN IT INSTRUCTURE WHICH MAY DEFINITELY HELP ALL THESE APPROACHES
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00021	UM AND THE MICROSOFT AZURE CLOUD IN PARTICULAR UH IS CHARACTERIZED AH BY MULTIPLE FEATURES AND CHARACTERISTICS AND APPROACHES AND ARCHITECTURES
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00022	THAT UH MAY UH EVEN UH PROVIDE A MORE UH IN UH IN IT IS A FRAMEWORK
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00024	UH FIRST OF ALL UH I WOULD LIKE ALSO UH TO PROVIDE YOU SOME GENERAL EXAMPLE NOT ONLY FROM A TECHNOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE UH BUT ALSO FROM A PROGRAM PERSPECTIVE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00025	MICROSOFT FACTOR IS INVOLVED IN THIS PART OF THE SO CALLED COVETED NINETEEN HPC CONSORTIUM
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00026	UH WHICH IS COLLECTING THE MAJOR UM IT UH PROVIDERS UM TO MAKE COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00027	FOR SIMULATIONS AND ANY FINGER WHICH MAY BE REQUIRED TO SPEED UP AH RESEARCH RELATED TO COVET NINETEEN
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00028	ON THE OTHER HAND UH MICROSOFT THERE'S ALSO LAUNCHED A FIVE YEARS A PROGRAM UM WHICH IS UH A SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS UH PROGRAM
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00029	UM AND IT IS A PHILANTHROPIC PROGRAM WHICH HAS BASICALLY THE PURPOSE TO PROVIDE A COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES UM CONSULTANCY UH IN ORDER TO EMPOWER
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00030	UH RESEARCHERS AND ORGANIZATIONS UH UH TO EXPLOIT AND DEVELOP UH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SOLUTIONS UH IN THE HEALTHCARE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00032	UH IN PARTICULAR UH AN APPROACH OF VETERAN MICROSOFT IS IS KEEN TO PURSUE EASY TO ESTABLISH UH SIGNIFICANT PARTNERSHIPS
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00033	UM MICROSOFT IT IS A IS A IS A GREAT UH TECHNOLOGICAL AND SOLUTION PROVIDER
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00034	UM BUT IS ALSO VERY KEEN UH TO LET'S SAY UH GET THE MOST UH OUT OF WHAT IS AVAILABLE UM FROM THE MARKET TO TO PROVIDE UH THE BEST OF SOLUTIONS OF
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00035	FOR TO ENABLE OUR PARTNERS UH IN ORDER TO PROVIDE UH THE BEST OF SOLUTIONS TO OUR UH JOINT END USERS
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00036	AND THE FOR SURE UH ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PARTNERS WE HAVE UH IN UH IN THIS UH FRAMEWORK
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00037	AND BUT IS DEFINITELY AUSTIN AS UH FOR FOR THIS UH SPEECH AND FOR THIS UH CONFERENCE IS ACTUALLY CAD FEM MEDICAL
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00038	UM UH AS YOU KNOW UH CADFEM MEDICAL AS DEVELOPED UM A PLATFORM UH CALLED UH DOC Q
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00039	UM BUT AS BASICALLY THE PURPOSE UH TO ALLOW UH SIMULATIONS AND UNCHECKED SIMULATIONS
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00040	PARTICULAR UH TO MAKE THEM AVAILABLE TO BE USED UH BY DOCTORS AND MEDICAL STAFF
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00041	TO SCALE MULTIPLE UM POSSIBLE ISSUES THE IN UH UH IN THE SO CALLED IN SILICON MEDICINE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00042	DOCTOR CUE IS A SCALABLE AND FLEXIBLE SOFTWARE PLATFORM UH AND THAT'S WHY IT'S UH WORKING VERY WELL WITH THE MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGY
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00043	BECAUSE OF ITS UH UH SCALABLE AND FLEXIBLE INFRASTRUCTURE AND SOLUTION THAT THE MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGY CAN ACTUALLY PROVIDE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00044	DOCQ CORE IS THE PLATFORM AND OVER THERE THERE ARE MULTIPLE MODULES WHICH MAY RESPOND TO MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00045	HERE WE HAVE CHOSEN TO CONSIDER A FEW EXAMPLES OUT OF THE MULTIPLE ONES THAT THE CATHETER MEDICAL MAY PROVIDE THEM
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00047	UH ONE IS UH DOC Q RP UH WHICH HAS BEEN DESIGNED UH FOR UH SURGICAL PLANNING OF FOR STEROMAXILLARY EXPANSION SO FOR EXAMPLE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00048	UM HERE UM THE PLATFORM DOC PLATFORM TOGETHER WITH MICROSOFT HAS ALLOWED US TO DEVELOP UH OR TO RUN UH UP TO ONE HUNDRED BY YOUR MECHANICAL SIMULATIONS IN JUST THE FIFTEEN MINUTES
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00049	UM AND ANOTHER PLATFORM UH IS A DOC Q OR ESA UH THAT SUPPORTS UH THE IN DIAGNOSIS AND THERAPY OF OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP UH UPNEYA
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00050	ALSO IN THIS CASE UH UH TYPICAL HIGHER PERFORMANCE COMPUTING UH FLUID DYNAMICS AND EMPHASIZED SIMULATIONS ARE UH UH USED AND EXPLOITED
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00051	BUT THIS TIME NOT WITH THE TYPICAL IDEA OF DEVELOP UH OF USING THEM IN TYPICAL MANUFACTURING UH UM ENVIRONMENTS BUT TO TO LEVERAGE THEM FOR ENCYCLOPEDIA MEDICINE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00052	AND UH UH DOC Q VIRTUAL IS USED FOR A VIRTUAL IMPLANT TESTING UH IN THIS CASE UH SCALEABILITY UH IS REALLY UH PLASMA
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00053	AND THE MICROSTRUCTURE BECAUSE OF ITS INFRASTRUCTURE IS ABLE TO SUPPORT UH THIS UH HORIZONTAL SCALABILITY ALLOWING A MASSIVE REDUCTION OF SIMULATION TIMES
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00054	AND UNDER EXAMPLE WHICH IS REALLY INTERESTING TO ME IS RELATED TO SIMULATIONS RELATED TO ARTERY DRUG DELIVERY
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00055	UM AS YOU CAN ALSO SEE HERE UH THE IDEA IS ACTUALLY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW DRUGS ARE DISTRIBUTED UH INSIDE OUR BODY BASED ON MULTIPLE VARIABLES
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00056	IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MINIMIZE DRUG CONCENTRATION IN ASTHETIC ISSUES AND MAXIMIZE DRUG CONCENTRATION IN DAMAGED ISSUES
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00057	UM SO OUR MICROSOFT UH CLOUD UH CAN ACTUALLY UH HELP UH IN UH WE HAVE SEEN WITH CATHY AND MEDICAL SOME GREAT EXAMPLES
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00058	BUT WE COULD BRING UH MULTIPLE EXAMPLES SO AGAIN UH WITH CADFEM MEDICAL ADDITIONAL ONES UH AND UH WITH UH OTHER PARTNERS
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00059	UM ACTUALLY THE THE MICROSOFT CLOUD HAS DECIDED TO MAKE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS FOR IPERFORMANCE COMPUTING SPECIFIC ARCHITECTURE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00060	SO IT'S NOT AH SURE IT'S NOT A GENERAL PURPOSE CLOUD THAT MAY ALSO DO A PERFORMANCE COMPUTING
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00061	BUT INSIDE MICROSOFT TASK CLUSTER THERE ARE SOME SPECIFIC ARCHITECTURES AND COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES THAT HAVE BEEN DESIGNED ON PURPOSE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00062	UH TO PROVIDE THE THE BEST ENVIRONMENT FOR A PERFORMANCE COMPUTING WORKLOADS UH HERE ON ON THE RIGHT YOU YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THEM
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00063	BECAUSE UM UM I PERFORMANCE COMPUTING WORKLOADS AND MAY HAVE UM DIFFERENT UM MAY HAVE MANY CHARACTERISTICS IN TERMS OF ARCHITECTURE IN COMMON
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00064	BUT MAY BE VERY DIFFERENT ONE FROM FROM THE OTHER IN TERMS OF THE COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES WHICH MAY BE REQUIRED
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00065	FOR EXAMPLE AS YOU KNOW VERY WELL UH UH IN SOME CASES UH WORKLOADS ARE VERY CPU INTENSIVE IN OTHER CASES THEY ARE MORE GPU INTENSIVE AND THERE ARE MULTIPLE OTHER CHARACTERISTICS
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00066	SO THE IDEA IS REALLY UH THROUGH MICROSOFT TECHNICAL CLOUD TO PROVIDE A VERY BIG RANGE OF AVAILABLE ARCHITECTURE AND COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00067	SO THAT EACH WORKLOAD THE EACH HHHPC WORKLOAD THE MAY ACTUALLY FIND THE THE WRITER UM DESIGNER THE RIGHT ARCHITECTURE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00068	AND WITH THE GREATER FLEXIBILITY AS YOU CAN SEE HERE UM IN ORDER TO UM ENSURE UH THAT THE RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED UH MAY BE AVAILABLE EXACTLY WHEN THEY NEEDED
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00069	BUT ONLY IF IT NEEDED SO UH WITH NO UH THE IDEAS REALLY TO PAY FOR WHAT IS USED AND UH TO HAVE RESOURCES AVAILABLE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00070	BUT BASICALLY NOT TO DESIGN AND PAY FOR INFRASTRUCTURES DESIGNED FOR PIXELS UH BUT UM BUT THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THE PIXELS
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00071	ALSO LEVERAGING AZURE CLOUD UH ALLOWS ALSO FIRST OF ALL TO SCALE AS NEEDED
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00072	UM SO AS WE WERE SAYING UH DO WE IS A KIND OF WORKLOAD THAT IS ACTUALLY REQUIRING THE CAPABILITY TO SCALE UH BUT ALSO THE POSSIBILITY TO LEVERAGE THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00073	UH SO EVERY SIX MONTHS EVERY ONE YEAR EVERY THREE MONTHS UH SOME COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES ARE SUBJECT TO TECHNOLOGICAL REFRESH
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00074	AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IN THE CLOUD IS MADE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE WHILE ON THE CONTRARY UH ON PREMISES RESOURCES MAY ARE NORMALLY REFRESHED IN A THREE YEARS OR FIVE YEARS A TIME FRAME
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00075	THAT SET THE UH WE ARE AT THE END OF UH OUR TEN MINUTES UH ANOTHER KEY UM PIECE OF INFORMATION I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00076	IS THAT MICROSOFT CERTIFICATION HAS BEEN ALSO DESIGNED AND IS CONSTANTLY MAINTAINED UH TO ALLOW THE LARGEST POSSIBLE UH REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00077	UM AS FAR AS PUBLIC HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES AND LIKE SCIENCE AND FORMAL CERTIFICATIONS ARE CONCERNED UH SO WITH THAT I DEFINITELY WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00078	UM REMIND YOU THAT IN THIS UH TEN MINUTES UH WE HAVE JUST PROVIDED UH SOME UH GREAT EXAMPLES OF COLLABORATIONS WITH CALIFORNIA MEDICAL
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00079	BUT WE KNOW THAT UH UH THE RANGE OF SOLUTIONS UH WHICH MAY BE NEEDED UH UH FOR INCIDENT MEDICINE UH UH IS HUGE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00080	AND I I WOULD BE VERY HAPPY UH TO TO HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO DISCUSS THEM AND UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN SUPPORT YOU UM AT UM FOR FOR OTHER SOLUTIONS AND NEEDED YOU MAY YOU MAY HAVE
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00081	WITH WITH THAT IF THERE'S ANY QUESTION AND IF WE HAVE STILL SOME TIME AVAILABLE I WILL BE VERY HAPPY TO RESPOND IF NOT REALLY THANK YOU
YTB+M6ZkaU7cLu4+00083	THANK YOU VERY MUCH DANIELA BIZANA
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00002	I HOPE THAT WE HAVE CONVEYED THE FACT THAT THERE'S QUITE A FEW ACTIVITIES
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00003	THAT ARE ONGOING AND ARE BEING INITIATED BOTH IN COLLABORATION WITH THE STANFORD CENTER
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00004	AS WELL AS ACTIVELY PURSUED WITHIN HARVARD AFFILIATED HOSPITALS AND CLOSE COLLABORATORS IN THE ORGANIZATION
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00005	WE WOULD HOPE TO USE THIS EXPERIENCE AND TO EXPAND UPON IT TO CREATE A A VERY SPECIAL OPPORTUNITY IN THE FIELD OF MCFS
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00006	BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE DO NEED SUPPORT FROM THE COMMUNITY WE NEED PARTICIPATION IN OUR IN OUR STUDIES
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00007	AND I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO FIND INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD CONTRIBUTE
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00008	UM TO OUR SUPPORT AND EVEN THE EXPANSION OF THESE ACTIVITIES OVER THE UPCOMING MONTHS AND YEARS
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00009	SO THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A SHAMELESS PLEA UH FOR FINANCES AND I THINK LINDA HAS A COUPLE OF SLIDES HERE THAT SHE WANTED TO GO OVER

YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00039	THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE IN THE WORLD THAT ARE THAT ARE SUFFERING AND WE ARE REALLY APPRECIATIVE TO THE CLINICIANS THAT ARE SPENDING THEIR TIME IN IN TREATING THESE PATIENTS AND WE NEED TO HAVE MANY MANY MANY MORE CLINICIANS
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00040	AND WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO FUND A CENTER OF EXCELLENCE HERE AT HARVARD
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00041	AND THEN HOPEFULLY AT MULTIPLE CENTER OF EXCELLENCIES AROUND THE WORLD SO THAT PATIENTS CAN ACTUALLY SEE PATIENTS PATIENTS CAN ACTUALLY SEE CLINICIANS THAT CAN ACTUALLY TREAT AND HELP AND SUPPORT THEIR ILLNESS AS THEY'RE GETTING THROUGH THIS

YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00045	BECAUSE WE COULDN'T DO THIS RESEARCH WITHOUT WITHOUT YOUR SAMPLES AND WITHOUT YOU ANSWERING SURVEYS AND QUESTIONS AND BEING BOTHERED AND AND HAVING YOU SPEND YOUR ENERGY TO HELP US FIND ANSWERS FOR MANY MANY MORE PEOPLE THAT ARE SUFFERING OUT THERE
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00046	AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO SPECIFICALLY THANK THE DONORS SOME ARE HERE TODAY IN THE AUDIENCE AND THEY'RE ALL OVER THE WORLD WHO ARE LISTENING AS WELL WE COULD NOT DO ANY OF THIS RESEARCH WITHOUT YOU BECAUSE ALL OF IT IS PRIVATELY FUNDED
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00047	SO I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FIRST AND I JUST WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO DO THAT IF YOU CAN PLEASE SHARE WITH ME
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00049	I'VE MOSTLY SAID WHAT'S ALREADY ON THE SLIDE BUT WITH NIH HAVING THIRTY NINE A THIRTY NINE BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET WE HOPE SOMEDAY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE MORE MONEY FOR MMECFS FUNDING
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00050	AND IT MAY TAKE US GETTING A BIOMARKER FOR THEM TO REALLY STEP UP THEIR FUNDING SO WE'VE BEEN REALLY TRYING TO FIND A DIAGNOSTIC IN A BIOMARKER AND ALSO OF COURSE TO FIND TREATMENTS AND TO PUSH SOME PILOTS GOING AND SOME TREATMENTS
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00051	AND AND YOU CAN GET THIS GOING UH FROM PRIVATE FUNDING AT AT THIS POINT
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00052	SO I MEAN MY GOAL IS TO RAISE FIFTY TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND REALLY SCALE UP THIS RESEARCH WE HAVE SO MANY RESEARCHERS THAT COULD SPEND MUCH MORE TIME ON THIS IF WE HAD MORE FUNDING
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00053	SO WE'RE ASKING FOR PHILANTHROPISTS OUT THERE WE'RE ASKING FOR PEOPLE WHO REALLY WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN MEDICAL RESEARCH AND IN HELPING PEOPLE GET THEIR LIVES BACK ALL OVER THE WORLD SO I WILL GO ANYWHERE AT ANY TIME TO MEET WITH PEOPLE WHO WANT TO KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING AND WHY
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00054	AND SO WE ASK FOR YOUR HELP TO HELP US INTRODUCE US TO THOSE PEOPLE
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00055	BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR HELPING US CONTINUE THIS AND HELPING US SCALE THIS UP OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS WE'VE STARTED THE FOUNDATION IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE AND AND WE'VE REALLY STARTED A LOT OF RESEARCH IN THE LAST FEW YEARS AND
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00056	AND IT'S REALLY ON ON A REAL GRAPH GOING WAY HIGH QUICKLY SO WE WE NEED YOUR HELP TO HELP SCALE THAT UP WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO IS IS SET UP CENTER OF EXCELLENCE HERE AND LIKE I SAID EVERYWHERE
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00057	BECAUSE IF WE DON'T HAVE CLINICIAN SEEING PATIENTS WE DON'T HAVE RESEARCH AND IF THE PATIENTS CAN'T SEE CLINICIANS THEY CAN'T BE HELPED
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00058	SO ONE THING WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE A REAL BIG EFFORT IS FOR MEDICAL EDUCATION AND TO BRING CLINICIANS NUMBER ONE TO HARVARD HERE AT A CENTER OF EXCELLENCE TO HELP
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00059	PATIENTS BE ABLE TO HAVE NOT ONLY SERVICES BUT ALSO TO HAVE A TRAINING GROUND FOR OTHER CLINICIANS TO BE ABLE TO TRAIN THEM HERE AND THEN SEND THEM OUT TO HELP PATIENTS EVERYWHERE AND THEN TO FEED ALL THE RESEARCH THAT'S GOING TO BE HAPPENING ALL OVER THE WORLD
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00060	SO THAT'S WHAT WE CALL A CENTER OF EXCELLENCE AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I I HEAR SOMEBODY COMMENTED ON EARLIER THAT THEY TRIED TO DO BEFORE WE NEED TO DO THIS NOW
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00061	AND AS WE HAVE HERE NOW TIME TIME IS NOT OUR FRIEND AND WE REALLY NEED TO FIND ANSWERS NOW BUT I WANT YOU TO COME GO HOME FROM HERE AND UNDERSTAND AND AND BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE REALLY DO CARE AND PEOPLE ARE WORKING ON THIS ALL OVER THE WORLD
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00062	AND WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER WE ALL WANT ANSWERS AND WE ALL WANT TO HELP AND GIVE PATIENTS THEIR LIVES BACK SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SPENDING THE TIME WITH US TODAY AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR INPUT AND YOUR HELP AS PATIENTS AS DONORS AS SUPPORTERS
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00063	AND WE HOPE CONTINUE WHAT WE'RE DOING AND REALLY SCALE IT UP AND THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00065	WE HAVE THIS IN IN YOUR PACKET IT'S JUST A POSTCARD OF OF HOW IF YOU MIGHT WANT TO GET INVOLVED UM WE DO WANT TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE JUST TO TELL AS MANY PEOPLE AS YOU CAN ABOUT MECFS
YTB+Qd48hzyLxmU+00066	WE REALLY WANT TO INCREASE THEIR AWARENESS AND REALLY INCREASE PEOPLE KNOWING ABOUT IT AND AND SO I WON'T GO OVER THESE DETAILS BUT WE HAVE THIS IN YOUR PACKET THANK YOU VERY MUCH
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00002	ALL OF MY RESEARCH HAS FOCUSED ON A COW THAT HAS JUST HAD A BABY SO COWS HAVE TO HAVE A BABY ONCE A YEAR IN ORDER TO MAKE MILK
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00004	BUT WHEN THEY HAVE THE BABY THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT CHALLENGES AND STRESSORS IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT THAT MAKE MANY OF THEM SUSCEPTIBLE TO DISEASE
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00005	SO MY RESEARCH IS REALLY FOCUSING ON MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND THE BEHAVIOR OF THE COWS AND HOW THESE INFLUENCE THEIR RISK OF DISEASE AFTER THEY HAVE THE BABY
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00007	UM I'M ALSO VERY INTERESTED IN DESIGNING PINS FOR COWS TO HAVE BABIES AND TO DO THAT I I LET THE COWS TELL ME WHAT THEY WANT SO I GIVE THEM AN ENVIRONMENT FOR INSTANCE THAT HAS
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00008	ONE VERY OPEN AREA AND ONE VERY CLOSED AREA AND LET THEM CHOOSE WHICH THEY PREFER TO HAVE IN THE RESEARCH I'M DOING AT THE CENTER INVOLVES ASSESSING THE EMOTIONS OF DAIRY CATTLE
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00009	THIS IS KIND OF A RECENT AREA OF RESEARCH IT INVOLVES A COGNITIVE BIAS TASK TO OBJECTIVELY MEASURE THE EMOTIONS OF THE ANIMALS
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00010	BUT THIS TYPE OF STUDY HAS NEVER BEEN DONE IN CATTLE BEFORE SO I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT IT UM IT'S KIND OF A COMPLICATED UM EXPERIMENT BUT IT BASICALLY INVOLVES TRAINING ANIMALS IN A TASK
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00011	AND HOW THEY INTERPRET DIFFERENT COLOR SCREENS ENABLES ME TO ASSESS THEIR PESSIMISTIC OR OPTIMISTIC OUTLOOK ON LIFE
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00012	SO THE EXPERIMENT I JUST FINISHED RIGHT NOW WAS A DEHORNING TRIAL SO I LOOKED AT THEIR BASELINE EMOTIONS BEFORE DEHORNING AND AFTER DEHORNING I FOUND THAT DURING THE PAIN PHASE THEY EXHIBITED A MORE PESSIMISTIC
YTB+UDT7zSfOu1E+00013	INTERPRETATIONS OF THESE SCREENS SO MY NEXT PLAN IS TO USE THE SAME TRIAL TO LOOK AT THE EMOTIONS OF ANIMALS HOUSED SOCIALLY AND HOUSED ISOLATED
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00002	GOOD AFTERNOON WE ARE SO EXCITED TO BE STANDING HERE IN FRONT OF YOU ALL TODAY AND HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON A TOPIC THAT WE ARE ALL VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT TODAY'S PRESENTATION WILL BE FOCUSING ON ALL THINGS MARKETING BRANDING AND SOCIAL MEDIA
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00003	THROUGHOUT THIS PRESENTATION WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT THE STRENGTH AND ALL OF OUR SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AND HOW IT ALL STARTS WITH ONE PURPOSE AND ONE MESSAGE ONE THAT WE ALL SHARE TO START OFF WE JUST WANTED TO INTRODUCE OURSELVES
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00004	SO I'LL GO FIRST MY NAME IS ISABELLA VOIGHT AND I'M THE NEW MARKETING MANAGER THIS YEAR
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00006	I'M ORIANA MENDEZ AND I'M THE MEMBERSHIP MANAGER
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00008	AND I'M ZACHARY ZELENAK I'M THE OPERATIONS MANAGER
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00010	SO I GUESS WE'LL GET RIGHT INTO IT SO TODAY WE'LL BE GOING OVER A FEW DIFFERENT AREAS THAT HAVE CREATED STRONG IMPACTS FOR OUR ORGANIZATION AND THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED WITHIN PROGRAMS OF ANY SIZE
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00011	TODAY'S CONTENT INCLUDES HOW WE OPERATE SOME BRANDING GUIDELINES SOCIAL MEDIA REQUESTS CALENDARS ENGAGEMENT CAMPAIGNS MEMBER PRESENCE PHOTO STYLE AND RESOURCES
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00012	ALL FOLLOWED BY SOME KEY TAKEAWAYS TO BETTER YOUR PROGRAMS MARKETING BRANDING AND SOCIAL MEDIA
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00014	AS A LARGE PROGRAM WE HAVE A MARKETING TEAM OF APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY PEOPLE WITH THAT IN MIND MUCH OF WHAT WE DO CAN BE SCALED DOWN FOR PROGRAMS WITH AS LITTLE AS ONE PERSON MANAGING MARKETING
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00015	FOR ORGANIZATIONS SPECIFICALLY MARKETING IS BROKEN DOWN UNDER OUR MARKETING MANAGER INTO THREE TEAMS PUBLIC RELATIONS MULTIMEDIA AND DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY EACH TEAM HAS SPECIFIC RESPONSIBILITIES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR THAT HELPS SUPPORT OUR MARKETING GOALS
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00017	EVERY YEAR OUR MARKETING TEAM DIRECTORS CREATE NEW BRAIN AND GUIDELINES THAT WILL BE USED FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR BRAIN AND GUIDELINES SERVE AS THE OFFICIAL PLACE FOR OUR MEMBERS TO REFERENCE WHEN THEY NEED CLARIFICATION ON ANYTHING SPECIFIC THAT ENCOMPASSES OUR BRAND
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00018	AND ALLOWS ANYONE WHO LOOKS AT A BRAND TO RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS DANCE MARATHON AT THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA IN ORDER TO PROVIDE ONE COHESIVE MESSAGE TO OUR COMMUNITY WE INCLUDE A VISION STATEMENT A MISSION STATEMENT AND AN ABOUT A SECTION FOR ALL OF OUR DIRECTORS AND OUR ORGANIZATION TO USE
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00019	WE ALSO INCLUDE COLOR PALETTES FOR OUR CAMPAIGN FEED AS WELL AS OUR YEAR LONG COLORS WE DECIDE ON THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF FONTS THAT WE WILL USE ON ALL OUR GRAPHICS AND WE INCLUDE ALL OF OUR LOGOES THAT WE WILL USE ON ANY SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS AS WELL AS ON OUR GRAPHICS ON SOCIAL MEDIA
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00020	WE ALSO INCLUDE TERMINOLOGY STATEMENTS SO THAT ALL OF OUR TERMS ARE CONSISTENT AND CAPITALIZED WHEN NECESSARY
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00021	WE WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND CREATING A BRANDING GUIDELINE OF YOUR OWN AMONGST YOUR MARKETING TEAM IN ORDER TO GET EVERYONE ON THE SAME PAGE AND GIVE OTHER MEMBERS WITHIN THE WITHIN YOUR ORGANIZATION SOMETHING TO REFER BACK TO WHEN THEY ARE CREATING CONTENT
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00022	IF YOU WOULD LIKE FOR US TO SEND YOU OUR BRANDING GUIDELINE WE ARE MORE THAN HAPPY TO SHARE OURS WITH YOU SO THAT YOU HAVE IT AS A REFERENCE
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00024	SO HERE YOU CAN SEE AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT SOME OF OUR BRANDING ELEMENTS LOOK LIKE IN ACTION FOR OUR CURRENT SUMMER CAMP FEED YOU WILL SEE THAT THE GRAPHICS INCLUDE ALL OF THE COLORS ON THE COLOR PALETTE
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00026	AND AND THAT ALL THE FAUNS ARE THE SAME YOU WILL ALSO NOTICE THAT OUR HIGHLIGHT COVERS MATCH WE ALWAYS CHANGE THE COLORS OF THESE FOR EACH CAMPAIGN TO MAKE SURE IT STANDS OUT EVEN MORE
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00027	EVEN THOUGH THESE DETAILS MAY SEEM SMALL THEY MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE AND ALLOW OUR FEET TO REPRESENT A VERY COHESIVE MESSAGE
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00029	THERE ARE ENDLESS AMOUNTS OF EVENTS AND INFORMATION THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SHARE ON OUR SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS IN ORDER TO KEEP THIS ORGANIZED AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE INCLUDING EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00030	WE DEVELOPED A SOCIAL MEDIA REQUEST FORM WHERE MEMBERS CAN FILL OUT A GOOGLE FORM AND TELL US WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO BE POSTED ONCE THEY FILL IT OUT THE MARKETING TEAMS TAKE ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT THEY GIVE US AND DECIDE WHAT OUR NEXT STEPS WILL BE MOVING FORWARD
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00031	ALL THE RESPONSES FROM THIS FORM ARE DIRECTLY LINKED TO A GOOGLE SHEET WHERE DESIGNERS WILL THEN GO IN AND CLAIM WHICH ONES THEY WANT TO DO AND THEN FROM THERE WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE ALL ADDED TO OUR SOCIAL MEDIA CALENDAR SO WE CAN POST IT ON TIME
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00033	SO TO EXPLAIN THIS PROCESS A LITTLE BIT FURTHER WE WANTED TO GIVE YOU A SCENARIO THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW TO APPROACH WHAT YOU ARE POSTING AND THE THOUGHT PROCESS BEHIND THAT DECISION
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00034	AN EXAMPLE OF A REQUEST WOULD BE THAT CAPTAIN APPLICATIONS ARE OPENING ON AUGUST THIRTIETH EVERY TIME WE GET A REQUEST THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE ARE ASKING OURSELVES IN ORDER TO COME UP WITH THE BEST GAME PLAN ON HOW TO PROMOTE THIS
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00035	SO WHAT PLATFORMS SHOULD YOU BE USING HOW EARLY DO YOU NEED TO POST DO YOU NEED TO POST REMINDERS SHOULD THIS BE A GRAPHIC OR A PHOTO SO I REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO START THINKING ABOUT ALL OF YOUR POSTS WITH THESE SAME QUESTIONS IN MIND
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00036	REGARDLESS IF IT'S A LARGE REQUEST OR A SMALL REQUEST IT'S STILL VERY VALUABLE TO GET CREATIVE AND TRYING TO THINK ABOUT REALLY THE BEST SOLUTION IN DEBATING WHAT IS BEST TO IMPORTANT TO SHARE ON THAT SPECIFIC PLATFORM
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00038	AS IS ABOUT EXPLAINED MEMBERS ARE ABLE TO SUBMIT REQUESTS FOR DIFFERENT MARKETING NEEDS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00040	THESE ARE POPULATED INTO OUR SOCIAL MEDIA CALENDAR AND USED TO KEEP TRACK OF WHAT NEEDS TO BE COMPLETED AND WHEN THIS CALENDAR IS KEY TO HAVING AN ORGANIZED COHESIVE MARKETING PLAN THROUGHOUT THE YEAR ON OUR CALENDAR IN PARTICULAR WE SEPARATE EACH TAB BY MONTH AND COLOR COORDINATE BY DIFFERENT TYPE OF POST
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00041	WE HAVE ALSO FOUND SEPARATING LARGER CALENDARS INTO THEIR OWN CALENDARS TO BE EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00043	HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT THIS EXACTLY LOOKS LIKE ON THE SCREEN YOU WILL SEE OUR SOCIAL MEDIA CALENDAR FOR TRANSFORM TODAY OUR LARGEST FUNDRAISING PUSH OF THE FALL AS YOU CAN SEE WE BREAK DOWN LARGER CAMPAIGNS HOUR BY HOUR TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE STAYING ON TRACK WITH WHAT NEEDS TO BE POSTED
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00044	THIS CALENDAR IS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BETWEEN THE MARKETING REQUEST FORM AND THE MARKETING TEAMS THAT WE WERE DESCRIBED EARLIER EVEN IF YOUR PROGRAM DOES NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY FOR DIFFERENT TEAMS WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND UTILIZING THIS PROACTIVE CALENDAR STRUCTURE TO ALLEVIATE THE STRESS OF CONSTANTLY COMING UP WITH CONTENT AS IT IS NEEDED
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00046	I'M SURE EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM CAN RELATE TO HOW HARD IT IS TO INCREASE SOCIAL MEDIA ENGAGEMENT IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE STILL WORKING ON OURSELVES
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00047	HOWEVER WE WOULD STILL LIKE TO SHARE SOME OF OUR BEST PRACTICES FOR EACH PLATFORM AND BREAK DOWN WHAT WE THINK IS VALUABLE TO POST AND WHAT IS NOT
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00048	SO STARTING WITH INSTAGRAM POSTS WE HAVE FOUND THAT WE ALWAYS GET THE MOST LIKES AND COMMENTS WHEN WE POST SOMETHING THAT INCLUDES PHOTOS OF PEOPLE
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00049	AS FAR AS INSTAGRAM STORIES WE REALLY ONLY SHARE UPDATES REMINDERS UPCOMING EVENTS AND ANY EXTRA INFORMATION THAT COMES UP TO KEEP IT ORGANIZED ON A BALL OF OUR HIGHLIGHTS
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00050	REPLY POSTS ARE USUALLY SUCCESSFUL WE'LL REPOST SOME OF THE RESPONSES TO MAKE MEMBERS FEEL RECOGNIZED
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00051	FACEBOOK IS DEFINITELY NOT WIDELY AS WIDELY USED AS OFTEN FOR USERS IN OUR GENERATION HOWEVER WE STILL USE FACEBOOK ALBUMS AS A PLACE TO SHARE ALL OF OUR PHOTOS AS WELL AS FACEBOOK EVENTS TO PROMOTE UPCOMING EVENTS THAT MEMBERS CAN SHARE TO THEIR TIMELINE
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00053	FOR MORE FUN PRESENTS WE USE TIKTOK TO SHOWCASE THE PERSONALITIES OF OUR MEMBERS AND THE FUN THAT THEY ARE HAVING AT OUR EVENTS WE ALWAYS TRY TO SHARE THESE AS REALS ON INSTAGRAM EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T ALWAYS SHARE THEM DIRECTLY TO OUR FEED
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00054	BLOGS AREN'T SOMETHING THAT EVERY PROGRAM MAY WANT TO DO
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00055	HOWEVER WE HAVE A LOT OF PASSIONATE WRITERS ON OUR TEAM THAT THEY ENJOY WRITING THESE WE REALLY ONLY SHARE THESE ON OUR WEBSITE AND INSTAGRAM STORIES FOR PARENTS AND NEW MEMBERS THAT MIGHT WANT TO READ THEM
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00056	LASTLY WE'RE FAIRLY NEW TO TWITTER BUT WE HAVE FOUND THAT A LOT OF SPONSORS AND LOCAL BUSINESSES IN OUR AREA INTERACT WITH US STILL ON THERE SO WE ALWAYS TRY TO UPDATE IT WHEN WE CAN
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00058	SO WE EXECUTE SEVERAL CAMPAIGNS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS WELL AS OUR YEAR LONG CAMPAIGN THAT MOST OF OUR MESSAGING FOR THE YEAR WILL REVOLVE AROUND WHILE THESE ARE IMPLEMENTED TO STRATEGICALLY HELP WITH FUNDRAISING THE ANTICIPATION AND EXCITEMENT THAT COMES WITH THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF EACH CAMPAIGN
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00059	AND THE HASHTAG THAT WE RELEASED WITH A VIDEO ALSO INSPIRES OUR MEMBERS AND GETS THEM LOOKING FORWARD TO WHAT IS TO COME
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00060	LAST YEAR OURS WAS CHOOSE CHANGE WITH THE IDEA THAT WE WERE WILLING TO ADOPT A CHANGE AFTER THE PREVIOUS TWO YEARS OF COVID AND A COMPLETE SHIFT IN THE WAY WE RAN OUR EVENTS
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00061	THIS WAS VERY POWERFUL AND EVERY YEAR WE TRY TO COME UP WITH A RELEVANT MESSAGE THAT PEOPLE WILL RELATE AND CONNECT WITH
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00063	IN ORDER TO MAKE THESE STAND OUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA WE TRY TO UTILIZE CONNECTIVE FEED AS WELL AS THE NEW PINNED POST FEATURE
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00065	SO HERE ARE TWO EXAMPLES OF CAMPAIGN FACEBOOK BANNERS WE UPDATE OUR FACEBOOK COVER PHOTOS FOR EACH CAMPAIGN AND ENCOURAGE ALL OF OUR MEMBERS TO UPDATE THEIR OWN PERSONAL ONES AS WELL WITH THE SAME ONE WE CREATE
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00066	ONE SIMPLE COVER PHOTO CHANGE LEADS TO MORE PROFILE CLICKS AND MORE QUESTIONS ASKED ABOUT WHAT WE DO BECAUSE COVER PHOTOS ALWAYS SHOW UP ON OUR TIMELINE AND FEED WE ALWAYS USE HASHTAGS FOR OURS JUST BECAUSE IT ADDS THAT EXTRA PUSH OF ENGAGEMENT
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00067	AND MAKES IT FEEL MORE OFFICIAL AGAIN THESE ALL MATCH THE COLOR PALETTE FOR THAT TIME AND UPDATE OFTEN
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00069	CONNECTIVE FEED IS A REALLY AWESOME DESIGN TACTIC THAT WE STRIVE TO IMPLEMENT FOR OUR DIFFERENT CAMPAIGNS THIS MAKES IT EASY TO LOOK AT THE FEED AND KNOW IMMEDIATELY WHERE THE CAMP WHERE THE CERTAIN CAMPAIGN STARTS AND ENDS
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00070	MAKING THE FEED CONNECT IS NOT TOO CHALLENGING AS LONG AS YOU PLAN IT OUT IN ADVANCE AND KNOW WHAT YOUR NEXT TWELVE POSTS WILL BE SO THAT YOU CAN DESIGN ACCORDINGLY TO MAKE IT WORK THE HARDEST PART IS COMING UP WITH THE DESIGN ITSELF AND MAKING SURE THAT YOU ARE POSTING IN THE RIGHT ORDER
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00071	HERE YOU CAN SEE OUR CONNECTIVE FEED THROUGHOUT OUR SEASON OF MIRACLES CAMPAIGN YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DO THIS FOR EVERY CAMPAIGN BUT DEFINITELY SOMETHING WORTH TRYING WHEN YOU CAN
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00073	MEMBER PRESENCE IS A LARGE PART OF WHAT MAKES MARKETING IMPACTABLE OUR MEMBERS HELP SUPPORT OUR CAUSE BY CONNECTING ON OUR VARIOUS OR BY COMMENTING ON OUR VARIOUS POSTS AND SHARING THEM THROUGHOUT THE YEAR TO STIMULATE THIS INTERACTION WE DEVELOP CAPTIONS THAT ENCOURAGE MEMBERS TO ENGAGE AND TAG THEIR FRIENDS
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00074	AND WE FACILITATE PROFESSIONAL HEADSHOTS TO GIVE OUR MEMBERS ANOTHER ELEMENT OF COMMUNITY AND ORGANIZATION PRESENCE YEAR LONG DURING CERTAIN CAMPAIGNS WE ALSO DEVELOP FACEBOOK BANNERS AS AN EASY WAY TO BOOST AWARENESS
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00075	IF YOUR ORGANIZATION HAS TEAMS WE ALSO FIND THAT TEAM INSTAGRAM SUPPORT RECRUITMENT EFFORTS AND INCREASE A SENSE OF COMMUNITY ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOT OFFICIALLY AFFILIATED WITH OUR MARKETING THEY ARE FUN ADDITION THAT LEADERSHIP THAT OTHER LEADERSHIP CAN FACILITATE
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00076	FOR EXAMPLE OUR SPONSORSHIPS TEAM RUNS THE SPONSORSHIPS INSTAGRAM
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00078	HERE YOU CAN SEE AN EXAMPLE OF THE PROFESSIONAL HEADSHOTS I MENTIONED EARLIER COLORED POLOS SIGNIFY YOUR TEAM AFFILIATION FOR EXAMPLE OUR LEADERSHIP TEAM BOASTS A WHITE POLO EACH YEAR SHOWN ON THE LEFT WHILST OUR FUNCTIONAL TEAMS GET A NEW COLOR EACH YEAR
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00079	I WAS ON MERCHANDISE LAST YEAR AND WE HAD LIME GREEN POLLOS ISABELLA WAS ON PUBLIC RELATIONS LAST YEAR AND THEY HAD LIGHT PINK POLLOS THE COMBINATION OF PROFESSIONAL HEADSHOTS AND POLLOS ELEVATES OUR MARKETING PRESENCE YEAR LONG
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00081	HERE AGAIN YOU CAN SEE ISABELLA'S HEADSHOT THE PROFILE BANNER SEEN ON ISABELLA'S PODCAST IS USED FOR CAUSE CONNECTED CAMPAIGNS OR SPECIFIC PUSHES AS ALREADY MENTIONED OUR YEAR LONG CAMPAIGN LAST YEAR WAS CHOOSE CHANGE
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00082	AS AN ELEMENT OF THIS OUR MARKETING TEAM DEVELOPED TEAM SPECIFIC BANNERS THAT GAVE MEMBERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THEIR MIRACLE THEIR PARENT MIRACLE CHILD'S STORY ON SOCIAL MEDIA
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00083	THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO USE MARKETING TO BOOST AWARENESS FOR A CAUSE IN A NEW WAY
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00085	OUR GREATEST ADVICE WHEN IT COMES TO PHOTOS IS TO CAPTURE MOMENTS OUR GOAL HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO POST PHOTOS THAT STRIKE A MEMORY OR ALLOW YOU TO ENVISION THE EMOTIONS THAT ARE OCCURRING WITHIN IT
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00086	CANDID PHOTOS ARE ALWAYS BEST WHEN TRYING TO CAPTURE THOSE MOMENTS AND EMOTIONS RATHER THAN JUST POST PHOTOS YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT KIND OF PHOTO YOU MIGHT NEED SO WE ALWAYS ENCOURAGE OUR PHOTOGRAPHERS TO TAKE PHOTOS OF ANYONE AND EVERYONE
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00087	AGAIN FOR BRANDING PURPOSES WE PUT THE SAME PRESET AND LOGO ON OUR PHOTOS EVERY SINGLE TIME SO THAT WHEN WE SHARE THEM PEOPLE WILL KNOW IMMEDIATELY THAT IT IS DM
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00089	REGARDLESS OF HOW LARGE YOUR PROGRAM IS AND THE AMOUNT OF REQUESTS YOU GET THROUGHOUT THE YEAR BEING ORGANIZED AS AN ABSOLUTE MUST
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00090	I HIGHLY RECOMMEND USING A PLATFORM THAT IS FREE SUCH AS WE WILL DRIVE FOR ALL OF YOUR CALENDARS ASSIGNMENTS FORMS PHOTOS GRAPHICS REALLY ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN THINK OF TO KEEP IT ALL IN ONE PLACE
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00091	WE PERSONALLY USE ADOBE SUITE FOR ALL OF OUR DESIGNS HOWEVER YOU CAN USE A FREE PLATFORM LIKE CANVA THAT WILL STILL ALLOW YOU TO CREATE COLOR PALETTES LOGOS SPONTS REALLY ALL THE SAME THINGS THAT WE DO IN ADOBE
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00092	ANY APP THAT YOU WANT TO USE TO PLAN OUT YOUR FEED AHEAD OF TIME I WOULD RECOMMEND USING PREVIEW UNFOLD OR TEZZA
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00094	WHILE WE HAVE GIVEN YOU A LOT OF INFORMATION TODAY I JUST WANT YOU TO REMEMBER THAT WE ALL SHARE THE SAME CAUSE AND THAT THERE IS BEAUTY IN THE POWER THAT WE HAVE TO SHARE OUR PASSION WITH OTHERS
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00095	MY GREATEST RECOMMENDATION FOR YOU ALL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR MESSAGING IS ALWAYS CONSISTENT USE YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA TO GET YOUR MEMBERS FEELING VALUED AND RECOGNIZED
YTB+UtAYBSJLnSo+00096	GET CREATIVE TO MAKE PEOPLE WANT TO ENGAGE WITH YOU AND CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO GROW ON EACH OF YOUR ACTIVE PLATFORMS

YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00020	TO GIVE SOME INTRODUCTION ABOUT OUR RESEARCH GROUP AT UNIVERSITAS GADJAH MADA
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00022	WE STARTED RECEPTORS ON UH ISOLATION OF UH LACTIC ACID BACTERIA FROM TRADITIONAL FERMENTED FOOD AND OTHER SOURCES SINCE UH NINETEEN NINETY ONE UP TO NOW
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00023	AND WE GOT HUNDREDS OF ISOLATES WHICH WERE THEN STARTED AN AMPULE AT THE FOOD AND NUTRITION CULTURE COLLECTION
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00025	IN A LARGER
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00027	YEAR OF UH TWO THOUSAND
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00029	WE STARTED SCREENING OUR UH ISOLATED WITH POTENTIAL UH SUPER BIOTIC CANDIDATES CURRENTLY WE HAVE UH SEVERAL STRAIN PROBIOTIC
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00030	WE HAVE ALSO CONDUCTED HUMAN CLINICAL TRIAL ON THE HEALTH BENEFIT OF OUR INDIGENOUS PROBIOTIC WHICH IS INVOLVED CUT MICROBIOTA ANALYSIS
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00031	SO THAT'S WHY OUR GOT MY MICROBIOTA STUDY ACTUALLY START FROM THE CLINICAL TRIALS OF UH PROBIOTIC
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00033	SO WE ARE ALSO INVOLVED IN ASIAN MICROBIOME PROJECT LED BY PROOF OF YOU AND GLOBALLY SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT UP TO NOW UH AFTER TWO YEARS
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00034	NOW OUR UNIVERSITY STATED UH UNIVERSITY CENTER FOR EXCELLENCE FOR PROBIOTIC STUDIES
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00035	YEAH BECAUSE OUR CONSISTENT RECEPTS RELATED TO PROBIOTY
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00037	UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00039	THIS PICTURE MENTIONING ABOUT
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00041	CUT MICROBIOTA FROM INFANT SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN THIS UH THE RESULT OF IMB UH ONE AND UH THREE OR FOUR I DIDN'T REMEMBER
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00042	AND ALSO CUT MY MICROBIOME DATA OF A DARK AND ELDERLY BASED ON OUR OWN STUDY
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00043	WE CAN SEE HERE IN THE PICTURE HERE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00044	YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00045	UH THIS IS UH THE SHOWING THE TOP THIRTY GENERA OF UH MICROBIAL UH
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00047	FICKLE MICROBIAL OFF A BABY YEAH AND WE CAN SEE HERE START FROM UH UH ONE MONTH THREE MONTHS SIX MONTH TWELVE MONTH AND MORE THAN TWELVE MONTHS
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00049	ABOUT UH UP TO TWO YEARS WE CAN SEE HERE THE MINORITY OF UH MICROBIOTA IN UH FECAL BACTERIA OR
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00051	BIFIDO BACTERIUM AND ALSO PATRIOTISM
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00053	AND THIS IS VERY MUCH DIFFERENT IF WE COMPARE TO GUT MICROBIOTA OF THE MATTER
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00054	BUT AFTER TWO YEARS WE CAN SEE HERE THE PROFILE OF UH MICROBIOTA OF CHILDREN RESEMBLE TO THE MIDDLE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00055	SO WE CAN SEE HERE WE CAN CONCLUDE THAT THE INDONESIAN INFANT HAS A
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00056	PACKED WITH THIS AND BIFIDOBACTERIA AND ENTEROTYPE WHILE START FROM SCHOOL AGE AND THEN ADULT AND ELDERLY THEY HAVE A PREVOTELLA AND ENTEROTYPE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00057	AND ACCORDING TO OUR PRECEPTS FOR ELDERLY WHO LIVE IN TAIWAN AND ALSO AT THE PALI THEIR BIFFIDO BACTERIA
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00059	THEN TO DECREASE WHILE THE ENTEROBACTERIA ASSAYED THAN TO INCREASE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00061	OKAY
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00063	UH HERE IS A PICTURE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00065	UH WHEN WE GET A SAMPLE FROM UH ADRIE AT THE PALEY IN THE UH ROOF OF UH TWENTY SIXTEEN YEAH
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00066	THE MOST PATIENT INTERVIEWING THE ELDERLY HERE ASKING ABOUT THE DAILY DIET AND ALSO HEALTH CONDITION INCLUDING THE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00067	AND WE ALSO HAVE TO BE PATIENT TO WIT UH THEIR UH FACES SOMETIMES START FROM EARLY IN THE MORNING
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00068	AND WE COMPILED THE FACES HERE AND PUT IT IN A UH COLD UH CONDITION
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00070	AND THEN WE PUT IN OUR LIKE GATES AND THIS PICTURE AREA WE APPRECIATE TO THE ALL UH RECEIVERS WHO INFORCE WHO PARTICIPATE IN A COLLECTING FICKLE SAMPLES
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00071	WE JUST LIKE TOURISTS WITH A LOT OF LIKE GADGETS HERE YEAH WE HAVE TO BRING FROM UH TEN PASSPORT TO OUR CITY TO TOKYO CARTA YEAH A LOT OF GADGETS
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00072	BECAUSE UH WE BRING UH COLD BOX UH UH INCLUDING FICKLE MATERIALS INSIDE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00074	SO
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00076	THIS FIGURE SHOW THE RELATIONS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GUT MICROBIOTA AND THE ORGANS
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00077	AND ALSO KIDNEY AND EVEN BLOOD YEAH
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00078	WE KNOW WELL YEAH THE TERMS CUT MICROBIOTA BRINK EXCRETED SUFFICIENT IMPORTANT CUT MICROBIOTA MY METABOLITES LIKE HERE WE SEE SHORTENED IN FETUS
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00079	AND PAPAYA PAPAYA PAPAYA PAPAYA PAPAYA PAPAYA PAPAYA PAPAYA PAPAYA PAPAYA PAPAYA PAPAYA PAPAYA PAPAYA PAPAYA PAPAYA PAPAYA PAPAYA PAPAYA PAPAYA PAPAYA PAPAYA PAPAYA PAPAYA PAPAYA PAPAYA PAPAYA PAPAYA PAPAYA PAPAYA PAPAYA PAPAYA PAPAYA PAPAYA PAPAYA PAPAYA PAPAYA PAPAYA PAPAYA PAPAY
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00081	GUT MICROBIOTA ALSO SUPPORT FIA IMMUNE SYSTEM WHICH IS IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT CAT HEALTH HOWEVER THE PALM OF CAT
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00083	WHEN THE BALANCE OF MICROBIOTA IS DISRUPTED BY SEVERAL FACTORS SUCH AS UH ANTIBIOTIC TREATMENT FOOD BORN PATHOGEN
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00084	EVEN COFFEE MIND IN FIBER AS WELL AS UNHEALTHY LIFE THIS BIAS
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00086	ACCORDING TO OUR STUDIES THESE BIASES OCCUR IN MALNUTRITION OR STUNTING CHILDREN METABOLIC DISORDER PERSON LIKE AN OBESITY AND THE OBESITY TYPE TWO
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00087	AND NOW WE ALSO LEARN THAT THE THESE PATIENTS INCLUDING CASTRO ENTERITIS ALSO SIMILAR FEEL YEAH
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00088	AT THE MOMENT WE CONDUCTED THE GUT MICROBIOME UH
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00090	FROM THE THE STUDIES
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00092	OKAY
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00094	SOME OF OUR PUBLICATIONS ARE IN OUR WEBSITE YEAH
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00095	UH PROF NAKAYAMA THIS MORNING ALSO ALREADY MENTIONED ABOUT THE CORRELATION BETWEEN UH UH CONSUMPTION OF
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00096	HI CARBOHYDRATE HERE RELATED WITH THE TUMOR NANCY OF RUMINOCOCCAE AND ALSO PACKED WITH THESE IN THE TIPE TYPE TWO PERSONS
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00098	WHILE CONSUMPTION OF FAT UH GROWS INCREASING OF ROBUTSIA RELATED
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00099	ALSO WITH PROFIT THE LAST YEAH THIS IS ACCURS IN THE UH OBESITY PERSON
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00101	THIS IS UH UH PUBLICATION RELATED TO THE I M P PROJECT
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00103	SO UH
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00105	WE CAN SEE HERE THIS IS A REPORT OF GOVERNMENT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN INDONESIA STILL FACING PROBLEMS
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00106	ON A PREVIOUS PREVIOUS PREVIOUS PREVIOUS PREVIOUS PREVIOUS PREVIOUS PREVIOUS PREVIOUS PREVIOUS PREVIOUS PREVIOUS PREVIOUS PREVIOUS PREVIOUS PREVIOUS PREVIOUS PREVIOUS PREVIOUS PREVIOUS PREVIOUS PREVIOUS PREVIOUS PREVIOUS PREVIOUS PREVIOUS PREVIOUS PREVIOUS PREVIOUS PREVIOUS PREVIOUS PREVIOUS PREVIOUS PREVIOUS PREVIOUS PREVIOUS PREVIOUS PREVIOUS PREVIOUS PREV
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00107	AND IN FACT
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00108	WE SELECT ONLY TWO AREA
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00110	FOR A STUDY THE MICROBIOTA OF UH STUNTING OR UNDER NUTRITION THE CHILDREN AT THE CHUCK CATTA HERE IN ITALY
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00111	AND ALSO AT BLOOM BLOOM IT'S REALLY RED COLOR MEAN THE IN THIS AREA UH PROBLEMS STUNTING IT'S MORE SERIOUS YEAH COMPARED TO OTHER PLACES WITH A YELLOW OR GREEN COLOR
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00113	OKAY UH THIS IS STUDY ON A GUT MICROBIOTA OF UH NORMAL AND UNDER NUTRITION
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00115	THEN WITH THE IT'S UH THREE TO FIVE YEAR THE LOCATION OF THE SUBJECT IT'S FROM JUTA CARTA
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00116	THE NUMBER OF SUBJECTS ABOUT UH UH TWENTY EIGHT CHILDREN WE UH CONDUCTED THIS RESEARCH DURING PANDEMIC
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00117	SO IT'S DIFFICULT FOR US TO GET A MORE SUBJECT YEAH FOR THIS STUDY WE CAN SEE HERE ABOUT THE FOOD CONSUMPTION
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00118	ACTUALLY THIS RESULTS CONDUCTED IN THE AREA WITH THE SOCIAL AND ALSO IN ECONOMICALLY SIMILAR
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00119	YEAH SO I MEAN THE THE INCOME OF THE BARON ARE SIMILARS BUT THE DIFFERENT IT'S UH THE DIET FOR THEIR CHILDREN
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00120	WE CAN SEE HERE YEAH UNDER NUT UNDER NUTRITION CHILDREN CONSCIOUS SLEEP AND SWEET MUCH UH MUCH MORE COMPARED TO THE NORMAL CHILDREN YEAH
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00121	AND HERE SEEM THAT THE SWEET AND SNAKE MAYBE GIVE UH WHAT YOU CALL IT UH YEAH UH THE EFFECT TO THE REGULAR MEALS
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00122	SO THAT'S WHY MAYBE CHILDREN DOESN'T WANT TO EAT THE REGULAR MEAL BECAUSE THEY PREFER SNACK AND SWEET AND ACCORDING TO OUR DATA WE CAN SEE HERE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00124	THE DIFFERENCES OF THIS DIET YEAH GAVE ALSO THIS BIAS WE CAN SEE HERE THE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00126	PROPORTION FIRMICUTE AND COMPARE THE PROPORTION OF FIRMICUTE AND BACTERIA INCREASE YEAH WHILE PROTEOBACTERIA HIGHER
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00127	AND ACTINOBACTERIA NOOR
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00129	AND THIS ALSO AFFECT TO THE SHORT CHAIN FATTY ACID BETWEEN THESE TWO GROUP WE CAN SEE HERE THE PROBIOTIC ACID AND BUTYRIC ACID THAT'S MUCH LOWER
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00130	IN THE MALE NUTRITION CHILDREN YEAH WHILE THE P EATS IT'S A HIGHER YEAH HERE THE P EATS IT'S A HIGHER IN THE MALE NUTRITION CHILDREN WE CAN UNDERSTAND YEAH DURING THE DISABILITY
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00131	WHEN THE MANY BACTERIA UH CHANGING YEAH IN HERE PARTICULARLY WE KNOW THAT PROTEOBACTERIA CONSISTS OF SEVERAL UH PATHOGENIC BACTERIA
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00132	AND ACTINOBACTERIA HERE IT'S A LIKE PEPTIDE BACTERIA UH THE EXAMPLE IT'S A PEPTIDE BACTERIUM BECOMING LOWER YEAH WE UNDERSTAND THE SHOOTING FOR THE ASSET HERE IT'S A DECREASING
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00133	IN THE MALNUTRITION CHILDREN THERE ARE ALSO UH OVER EXPRESSION YET NEAR UH OF MITOCHONDRIAL PREFIBRIKER AND OUR LOCUS HAPTERS HAPTERS AND ALSO SUCCINIC FIBER SUCCINIC FIBER WE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00134	WE HAVE PUBLISHED ALREADY THIS UH LAST TWO YEARS
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00135	AND THE NEXT WE COMPILE YEAH WE COMPILE UH FIGURE SAMPLES FROM UNDER NUTRITION WITH THE LOCATION AT LOMBOK
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00136	WITH A MORE CLEAR COMPARED TO CHOOSE CARROT UH THE IT'S YEAH CHOOSE CARROT WE CONDUCT A CUT MY GROUBIOTA THREE TO FIVE YEAR OLDS IN LOMBOK
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00137	WE CONDUCTED NINE TO ELEVEN YEARS OLDER CHILDREN YEAH HERE'S SOME PICTURE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00138	WHEN WE GIVE UH INFORMATION ABOUT UH SOME UH DOCUMENT THAT MY MUST FILL OUT YOUR LIKE UH
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00140	INFORMED CONCERN A DIETARY PATTERN THEY MUST UH FILL IN YEAH WE HELP THEM TO FILL IN THE DIETARY PATTERN AND ALSO THE OTHER QUESTIONNAIRE YEAH
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00141	AND THEN WE GAVE THEM THE COLD BOX
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00142	DO YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00143	YEAH THAT'S OKAY THANK YOU YEAH THE CHILDREN WILL BRING IT TO THEIR HOME AND GIVE THIS TO US IN THE MORNING THE FOLLOWING DAY
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00144	OKAY THE VERY IMPORTANT YEAH UH THIS ONE WE CAN SEE THE DIETARY INTAKE IT'S REALLY A LOWER FOR THE UNDERNUTRITION STUDENT UNDERNUTRITION CHILDREN
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00145	AND ALSO WE CAN SEE HERE SOME YEAH MANY FIVE AMONG SIX YEAH FILUM
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00146	ALSO DIFFERENT SIGNIFICANTLY AND HERE I FANCY PFIZER BACTERIA VERY VERY LOWER IN
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00147	AND THE NUTRITION CHILDREN WHILE A CARMANSIA IS HIGHER THIS IS VERY INTERESTING
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00148	WE WE THINK THAT ACCUMENCY YEAH ACCUMENCY BECOMING A DOMINANT BECAUSE UH NO NUTRITION FOR OTHER MICROORGANISMS SO
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00149	A CURRENCY A HAVE A CURRENCY A MUSICIAN FILLED A HAVE A MUSICIAN MUSICIANS
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00150	THEY HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME DOMINANT IN THIS UH AND THE NUTRITION GROUP
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00151	OKAY AND SINCE OUR RESEARCH IS ACTUALLY RELATED WITH THE PROBIOTIC WE HAVE A SEVERAL STUDY ON INTERVENTION OF LOCAL PROBIOTIC
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00152	AND ALSO THEIR GUT MICROBIOTA AFTER INTERVENTION ON OVERWEIGHT ADULTS AND ALSO UH DIABETIC WOMEN INCLUDING NON HALF THE
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00153	AND ALSO CASTRO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTERO ENTER
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00154	OKAY THEY COMMUNICATED MORPHOLOGICAL SAMPLES NEEDED FROM DIFFERENT TRIBES AND PLACES INCLUDING HAIR STATUS OF INDONESIA
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00155	FOR OBTAINING REAL PICTURE OF INDONESIAN CUT MICROBIOTA AND THEIR CORRELATION WITH THE HEALTH CONDITION OF COURSE COLLABORATION WITH ALL PARTNERS IS NEEDED
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00156	THIS IS OUR TEAM AND HAPPY TO UH MENTION ABOUT OUR WEBSITE HERE WE CONDUCT A TRAINING COURSE ON MICROBIOME ANALYSIS
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00157	AND ALSO ANALYSIS OF CAT MICROBIOTA PARTICULARLY FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS AND ALSO WE CONDUCT CLINICAL TRIAL FOR INDUSTRY RELATED TO PROBIOTIC AND CAT MICROBIOTA
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00158	OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND DOWNLOAD THE VERY
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00160	LIKE TO STOP OKAY
YTB+VGjeG1QtjQg+00161	YEAH THANK YOU
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00002	EVERYONE MY NAME IS LINDSAY WILSON AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF DANCE MARATHON AT FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00003	AND I'M SUPER EXCITED TO BE SPEAKING WITH YOU TODAY ABOUT HOW YOU CAN LOOK AT YOUR DATA TO MAKE DATABASE DECISIONS DURING YOUR FUNDRAISING PUSHES
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00005	FIRST I WANT TO GET A QUICK OVERVIEW OF THE TOPIC THAT WE'LL BE DISCUSSING TODAY THE FIRST PART OF THIS PRESENTATION WILL OUTLINE IMPORTANT DATA POINTS THAT YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING AT DURING YOUR FUNDRAISING PUSHES
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00007	I'LL COVER THE IMPORTANCE OF LOOKING AT THIS DATA CRITICALLY AND EXACTLY WHAT DATA POINTS THAT YOU CAN ANALYZE ADDITIONALLY I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT OUR YEAR FOR YEAR DATA
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00008	AND HOW YOU CAN USE THIS TO MAKE DATABASE DECISIONS WITHIN YOUR PROGRAM WHETHER IT'S DURING YOUR MARATHON OR WHETHER IT'S FUNDRAISING PUSH EVENT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO DO THAT
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00009	I'LL INCLUDE SOME EXAMPLES OF LOOKING AT THIS DATA AND HOW OUR PROGRAM AT TMFSCU FORMATS OUR CHARKING DOCUMENTS TO BEST VIEW THIS DATA
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00010	AT THE END I ALSO HAVE AN EXAMPLE TRACKING DOCUMENT AND IF NEEDED YOU CAN CONTACT ME FOR THAT AS WELL THE SECOND PART OF THIS PRESENTATION WILL BE ABOUT USING THAT DATA TO MAKE DECISIONS DURING YOUR FUNDRAISING PUSHES
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00011	HOW TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THAT YOU'RE SEEING OR EVEN HOW TO APPROACH THE POSITIVE DATA THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00012	DURING THIS PART OF THE PRESENTATION I'LL ALSO COVER DIFFERENT WAYS THAT YOU CAN IMPROVE OR INCENTIVIZE YOUR FUNDRAISING IN THE MOMENT EVEN IF IT'S RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR MAINEVENT
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00014	LOOKING AT YOUR DATA CAN BE EXTREMELY BENEFICIAL FOR EVERY PROGRAM BUT I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT SOMETIMES IT CAN BE EXTREMELY OVERWHELMING
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00015	HOWEVER IF YOU'RE ABLE TO SEE THAT DATA DURING YOUR FUNDRAISING INITIATIVES YOU'RE ABLE TO PINPOINT WHO'S EXCELLING AND WHO'S FALLING BEHIND SO THAT'S A HUGE BENEFIT OF LOOKING AT YOUR DATA
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00016	THIS ALLOWS YOU TO BE REALLY PROACTIVE ABOUT SOLUTIONS AND THE WAY THAT YOU RESPOND TO YOUR DATA ANALYSIS AS LONG AS YOU'RE ABLE TO PULL THIS DATA BEFOREHAND
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00018	IF YOU DO HAVE THIS DATA ACCESSIBLE BEFORE YOUR FUNDRAISING PUSHES AND YOUR PROCESS IS A LITTLE BIT MORE AUTOMATED AS I'LL SHOW YOU IN A LITTLE BIT
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00019	YOU MAY BE ABLE TO LOOK AT YOUR DATA TO MAKE BETTER DECISIONS ON HOW TO TARGET SPECIFIC AREAS THAT YOU MAY NEED TO IMPROVE IN FOR FUNDRAISING OR EVEN ENGAGEMENT WITHIN YOUR ORGANIZATION
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00020	SOME IMPORTANT DATA POINTS THAT WE LOOK AT SPECIFICALLY ACTIVE FUNDRAISERS THAT'S BROKEN DOWN BY POSITION
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00021	POSITIONAL BREAKDOWNS IN THAT INCOME INTERNAL TEAMS YEAR OVER YEAR OUR EXTERNAL TEAMS YEAR OVER YEAR AND OUR K THROUGH TWELVE PROGRAMS YEAR OVER YEAR DATA I'LL GO INTO THIS A LITTLE BIT MORE INTO DETAIL WITH SOME EXAMPLES ON THE NEXT SLIDE
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00023	NOW THESE SCREENSHOTS ARE FROM OUR CHECKING DOCUMENT THAT WE CREATED FOR OUR MEMBERSHIP LAST YEAR THESE ARE JUST SOME EXAMPLES OF WHAT OUR DOCUMENTS LOOK LIKE TO ANALYZE OUR DATA DEPENDING ON HOW WE LOOK WANT TO LOOK AT IT
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00024	AS YOU CAN SEE AT THE TOP WE CAN INPUT A SPECIFIC TIME AND OUR NUMBERS THROUGHOUT THE DOCUMENT WILL AUTO ADJUST TO GIVE US AN IDEA OF WHERE OUR NUMBERS WERE AT COMPARED TO THE LAST FEW YEARS
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00026	WE'RE ABLE TO QUICKLY SEE THIS DATA AND COMPARE IT IN ORDER TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT AREAS WE MAY NEED TO TARGET FOR IMPROVEMENT OR AREAS THAT WE MAY NEED TO LOOK AT AND USE THAT TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS IN OTHER AREAS
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00027	THE FIRST SCREENSHOT IS EVERY YEAR OVER YEAR ACTIVE FUNDRAISERS AS YOU CAN SEE OUR CORE TEAM WHICH ARE COORDINATORS SHOWED AN INCREASE IN ENGAGEMENT COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS YEARS
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00028	WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO HERE IS TAKE THIS POSITIVE ASPECT OF THE DATA AND USE IT TO IMPROVE OTHER AREAS THAT MAY NOT BE SEEING AS MUCH SUCCESS
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00029	DURING OUR MEMBERSHIP WE WENT TO THE SCORE TEAM TO SEE WHAT WAS WORKING WELL FOR THEM WHICH WE WERE ABLE TO APPLY TO A TEAM LIKE OUR CAPTAINS AS YOU CAN SEE WHO MAY HAVE SHOWN A LITTLE BIT OF A DECREASE IN THEIR ACTIVE FUNDRAISERS
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00030	THE NEXT SCREENSHOT IS INCOME PERCENTAGES THAT'S BROKEN DOWN BY POSITION USING THIS DOCUMENT WE'RE ABLE TO USE SIMILAR TACTICS TO SEE WHAT'S WORKING WELL IN ORDER TO TARGET DIFFERENT AREAS OF FUNDRAISING SUCH AS OUR ALUMNI
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00031	THE NEXT SCREENSHOT IS OF OUR TOTAL INTERNAL TEAM INCOME AND THIS CAN BE REALLY HELPFUL AS WE'RE ABLE TO LOOK AT THOSE SPECIFIC TIMES AND THAT OVERALL INCOME BROKEN DOWN BY TEAM TO SEE WHICH TEAM MAY NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A BOOST
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00032	IN FUNDRAISING OR EVEN IN AN ENGAGEMENT IT LEADS US TO LOOKING AT HOW OUR ORGANIZATION MAY RESPOND BEST TO IMPLEMENTING NEW FUNDRAISING STRATEGIES IN THE MOMENT
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00034	IF YOUR PROGRAM IS ABLE TO LOOK AT THIS DATA IN THE MOMENT YOU MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE QUICKER MORE EFFICIENT AND SUCCESSFUL DECISIONS BASED ON HOW YOU BELIEVE THAT YOUR ORGANIZATION RESPOND WILL RESPOND BECAUSE EVERY ORGANIZATION RESPONDS DIFFERENTLY
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00035	THIS COULD BE THINGS SUCH AS A COMPETITION BASED FUNDRAISING CHALLENGE LIVE UPDATES IN TRANSPARENCY WITH YOUR TOTALS OR EVEN SAYING THAT IT'S THEIR YOUR DANCERS LAST CHANCE TO REACH THEIR GOAL
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00036	THE PURPOSE OF LOOKING AT THIS DATA IN DETAIL HERE THOUGH IS TO NOT BE AFRAID TO MAKE CHANGES WHILE IT'S HAPPENING
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00037	AND LEARNING THAT IT'S OKAY TO IMPLEMENT A BRAND NEW FUNDRAISING PUSH IN THE MOMENT DURING YOUR MARATHON WHICH IS HOW WE STUMBLED ACROSS SOME SOLUTIONS THAT WE'VE CREATED SUCH AS FUNDRAISING FACEBOOK
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00039	NOW FUNDRAISING PHASE OFF BEGAN ORIGINALLY AS AN INTERNAL TEAM ONLY TRADITION
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00040	ON PUSH DAYS WHERE ALL OF OUR INTERNAL TEAMS COMPETED IN A BRACKET STYLE COMPETITION WE REALLY HAVE AN OVERWHELMINGLY POSITIVE RESPONSE TO THIS INITIATIVE SO MUCH THAT WE WERE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THIS WITH OUR ORGANIZATIONAL TEAMS AS WELL
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00042	IT REALLY HELPED TO PROMOTE A FRIENDLY COMPETITIVE ATMOSPHERE TO ENCOURAGE THAT POSITIVE FUNDRAISING MINDSET
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00044	THE CHAIRS AND THEIR DELEGATES WITHIN THESE ORGANIZATIONS COULD ALSO ENCOURAGE THEIR MEMBERS TO PARTICIPATE IN CENTIVIZING IT IN DIFFERENT WAYS DEPENDING ON HOW THEY BELIEVE THEIR ORGANIZATION WOULD RESPOND
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00046	AND SUCH AS ENCOURAGING THEM TO HIT THEIR TEAM GOAL OR EVEN REACHING AN INCENTIVE THAT THE CHAIR OR DELEGATE WAS GOING TO GIVE THEM DURING OUR MAIN EVENT WE WERE ABLE TO BROADCAST THIS IMAGE ON OUR SCREENS TO SHOW LIVE PROGRESS AND UPDATES
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00047	THE TEAMS ARE REALLY ABLE TO SEE THEIR PROGRESS LIVE ON THE SCREENS DURING OUR EVENT
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00048	AND OUR ORGANIZATIONS RESPONDED REALLY WELL TO THIS COMPETITION STYLE FUNDRAISING PUSH SO THIS IS ONE WAY WE WERE ABLE TO SEE OUR DATA LOOK AT IT OKAY MAYBE WE NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE IMPROVEMENT
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00049	IN THE FUNDRAISING AREAS OF OUR TEAMS SO THEREFORE WE WERE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THINGS SUCH AS FUNDRAISING CALENDARS
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00051	SO POWER HOUR IS ANOTHER WAY THAT OUR PROGRAM AT FSU IMPLEMENTS TO KIND OF INCREASE FUNDRAISING WHEN IT'S NEEDED AFTER WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT DATA SO DURING POWER HOUR THIS HOUR IS SOLELY DEDICATED TO FUNDRAISING
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00052	HOWEVER YOU CAN SET WHATEVER GOAL YOU WANT WHATEVER THAT LOOKS LIKE FOR YOUR PROGRAM OR WHAT YOU THINK MAY WORK BEST
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00053	FOR EXAMPLE WE USE HIT YOUR NEXT DOUBLE ZERO WHICH COULD MEAN GOING FROM FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO DOLLARS TO SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS DURING THIS HOUR
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00055	ANOTHER GOAL FOR POWER HOUR COULD BE TO REACH THEIR GOAL FOR THE PUSH OR FOR THE MARATHON OR EVEN HITTING THAT PERSONAL OR TEAM GOAL THAT THEY SET THROUGHOUT THE YEAR
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00057	WE WERE ABLE TO DISPLAY OUR INCREASING TOTAL LIVE DURING POWER HOUR ON THE SCREENS THEY WERE UPDATED LIVE IN EVENT AS OUR MCs HOSTED THE WHOLE HOUR INCLUDING TEAM AND FUNDRAISER SHOUTOUTS TO THOSE WHO HIT THAT NEXT DOUBLE ZERO MILESTONE
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00058	THIS DOCUMENT SCREENSHOT ON THE BOTTOM IS FROM A LIST OF NAMES WE PULLED FROM A REPORT THAT INDICATED IF THEY HIT THAT NEXT DOUBLE ZERO IF THEY WERE ANNOUNCED BY THE MC'S AND IF THEY HIT IT AGAIN DURING THAT HOUR
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00059	THIS LIVE RECOGNITION REALLY RECOGNIZES THEM FOR THEIR HARD WORK AND WE WERE ALSO ABLE TO CONTINUOUSLY INTEGRATE OUR MORALE TEAM FOR ENCOURAGEMENT AND HYPE TO MAKE THIS HOUR SUPER EXCITING AND ENGAGING
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00060	SO POWER HOUR CAN BE ONE WAY TO KIND OF INCREASE THAT ENGAGEMENT AS WELL AS FUNDRAISING BRING BACK THAT COMMUNITY ASPECT TO FUNDRAISING AND FOSTER THAT POSITIVE FUNDRAISING MINDSET AS WELL
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00062	THIS YEAR WE REALLY BEGAN TO FOCUS MORE ON VENMO INTEGRATION WE REALLY WANTED OUR MEMBERS TO DONATE DIRECTLY FROM VENMO TO THROUGH DONOR DRIVE IN ORDER TO DISCUSS THEM FROM HOLDING THOSE VENMO BALANCES IN THEIR PERSONAL VENMO ACCOUNTS
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00063	WE REALLY HIGHLIGHTED AT DONATING DIRECTLY USING THIS VENMO TRANSACTION FEATURE IN DONOR DRIVE WHICH REALLY HELPED US TO ALSO SEE MORE REALISTIC NUMBERS IN OUR DATA WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT THAT DATA
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00064	IF OUR MONEY IS ACTUALLY GETTING PUT INTO THOSE DONOR DRIVE ACCOUNTS AND NOT JUST SITTING IN THOSE VENMO ACCOUNTS
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00065	THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE ARE ABLE TO PROMOTE THE USE OF THIS THOUGH AND WE ARE ABLE TO CREATE CREATIVE BASED ON THE AREAS WE NEEDED TO SEE A LITTLE BIT MORE INCREASE IN
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00066	ONE WAY THAT WE DID THIS WAS BY SAYING THAT EVERY TENTH VENMO DONATION IN THE NEXT HOUR WOULD BE MATCHED TO DO THIS WE PULLED A REPORT FILTERED FOR VENMO DONATIONS AND THEN WENT THROUGH EVERY TENTH ONE TO SEE WHICH ONE WOULD BE MATCHED
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00067	ANOTHER WAY THAT YOU MAY BE ABLE TO PROMOTE THE USE OF THIS FEATURE IS BY SAYING THAT THE TEAM WITH THE MOST VENMO TRANSACTIONS IN THE NEXT HOUR WINS SOME INCENTIVE THAT YOU SET FROM YOUR ORGANIZATION
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00069	AGAIN YOU CAN DO THIS BY PULLING A REPORT TO SEE THOSE VENMO TRANSACTIONS AND LOOKING AT IT THAT WAY
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00071	LASTLY YOU CAN REALLY PROMOTE THE USE OF VENMO INTEGRATION FEATURE BY CREATING A MAIN PAGE FOR FEES AND TICKETS AND PROMOTING DONATING VIA VENMO IN THAT WAY
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00072	WE REALLY TARGETED THIS FEATURE WHEN IT SEEMS LIKE STUDENTS MAY BE HOLDING THEIR VENMO BALANCES OR OTHER TACTICS WEREN'T SHOWING AS MUCH SUCCESS AND IT WAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAT OUR PARTICIPANTS REALLY HADN'T SEEN BEFORE ON THIS YEAR UM AND ENDED UP SEEING A LOT OF SUCCESS FROM IT
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00074	NEXT ONE OF MY FAVORITE WAYS TO RESPOND TO THOSE AREAS YOU MEAN YOU NEED TO PREVENT AFTER LOOKING AT YOUR DATA IS BY IMPLEMENTING A FINAL FUNDRAISING PUSH WITHIN YOUR PUSH OR EVEN YOUR MAIN EVENT
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00075	SO THIS LAST YEAR AT OUR MARATHON OUR FUNDRAISING DEVELOPMENT TEAM KIND OF CREATED A THEME FOR FUNDRAISING FOR THE FOR OUR MARATHON WHICH WAS LIKE
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00077	SO WE NAMED OUR FINAL FUNDRAISING PUSH BUILDING OUR LEGACY AND REALLY THE GOAL OF THIS PUSH WAS TO HIT YOUR OVERALL FUNDRAISING GOAL WHETHER THAT WAS A TEAM OR A PERSONAL GOAL DURING THE VERY LAST HOUR OF THE EVENT
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00078	THIS REALLY SUCCESSFULLY ENCOURAGED OUR DANCERS TO REACH THEIR FINAL DOLLARS BEFORE THE END OF THEIR SHIFT AND GET ALL OF THEIR FUNDRAISING IN BEFORE THE YEAR WAS OVER
YTB+VVJLEacmlGs+00080	THIS GRAPHIC THAT'S ON THE SLIDES WAS DISPLAYED LIVE ON THE SCREENS AS WELL WHICH SHOWED INCREASING LEGACY BLOCKS AS THE LAST HOUR UNFOLDED

YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00006	SO A COUPLE THINGS OF HOURS TURNED INTO A BACKGROUND ABOUT WARTBURG COLLEGE
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00007	WE ARE IN WAVERLY IOWA A KIND OF SMALLER TOWN WE HAVE ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED STUDENTS ON OUR CAMPUS OUR ORGANIZATION WAS ESTABLISHED IN TWENTY TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN TO TWENTY SEVEN
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00008	WE HAVE TWENTY NINE KIDDOS IN OUR ORGANIZATION SO THAT'S JUST LIKE THE DIFFERENT KIDS THAT WE HAVE WITH THE FAMILIES AND THEN OUR TOTAL AMOUNT OF PARTICIPANTS FOR LAST YEAR WAS THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00009	AND WE CURRENTLY HAVE AN AWARD FOR OUR MIRACLE MAKER AWARD THAT MEANS THAT LIKE WE HAVE WE'VE BEEN IN AN ORGANIZATION FOR LIKE BETWEEN TEN TO FOURTEEN YEARS AND WE GOT THAT AWARD AND WE'RE NUMBER SEVEN IN THE NATION FOR THE AMOUNT WE HAVE RAISED PER CAPITA
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00011	SO WHAT IS REGISTRATION PUSH DAY REGISTRATION PUSH DAY IS A DAY THAT WE SET TO AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SCHOOL YEAR IT'S OUR FIRST EVENT AND WE TRIED TO GET AS MANY PARTICIPANTS SIGN UP DURING THAT DAY
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00013	SO SOME STRATEGIES STRATEGIES THAT WE USE IS WE'RE SENDING OUT EMAILS TO LAPSED PARTICIPANTS AT MIDNIGHT
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00014	SO HOW WE DO THIS IS WE GET OUR LIST FROM LAST YEAR THAT WERE IN DANCE MARATHON AND WE SENT IT TO THEM AND THEN FOR OUR FIRST YEARS TO GET THEM INVOLVED
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00015	IS THEY DO AN INVOLVEMENT FAIR DURING ORIENTATION WEEK AND IF THEY ARE INTERESTED THEY COME TO OUR BOOTH AND SIGN UP AN EMAIL TO SEND OUT TO THEM
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00016	WE ALSO IN OUR EMAILS SEND OUT LINKS TO THEM ON THAT TOO WE DO PROMO CODE USUALLY IT'S LIKE FIVE DOLLARS OFF THAT DAY
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00017	WE ALSO CAN TEXT TO FIVE ONE FIVE FIVE FIVE TO REGISTER WE TRY TO SET GOALS THINK OF BIGGER PICTURES AND BREAK DOWN STRATEGIES WE USUALLY DO A POWER HOUR
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00018	WHICH IS USUALLY BETWEEN SEVEN TO EIGHT OR EIGHT TO NINE AND DURING THAT HOUR WE TRY TO GET AS MANY PARTICIPANTS SIGN UP DURING THAT TIME AND ARE OF COURSE OUR EXACT TEAM CONTINUES TO RECRUIT THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE DAY
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00020	SO WHAT IS OUR THE KEY TO OUR SUCCESSFUL REGISTRATION PUSHDAY IT'S OUR MORALE CAPTAINS UM OUR MORALE CAPTAINS ARE BASICALLY THE SHOWS THEY HELP RUN EVERYTHING
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00021	THERE'S USUALLY A COMPETITION BETWEEN OUR MORALE CAPTAINS
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00022	JUST TO SEE WHO CAN GET THE MOST AMOUNT OF PARTICIPANTS IT'S USUALLY LAST YEAR I THINK IT WAS A HYDRO FLASK AND A GIFT CARD OR LIKE JUST SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO LIKE KIND OF HELP THEM NOT GET MOTIVATED BUT LIKE A REWARD FOR THEIR HARD WORK
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00023	UM OUR MORALE CAPTAINS ALSO PRINT OUT CODES AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY SEND THEM TO FOR THEIR TEAM
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00024	USUALLY THAT WE HAVE LIKE MORALE CAPTAINS HAVE LIKE A SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF GOAL FOR HOW MANY PEOPLE THEY WANT ON EACH ON THEIR TEAM
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00025	SO THEY DO THAT THEY HAVE THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL PROMO CODE SO IT'S LIKE ANOTHER OF THE FIVE DOLLARS OFF
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00026	AND THEN GETTING THEM PUMPED GETTING THEM EXCITED FOR IT AND GIVING THEM THE RESOURCES TO SUCCEED IF YOU DON'T HAVE MORALE CAPTAINS OUR CLOSEST PROBABLY THING WOULD BE LIKE HAVING AN EXACT TEAM
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00027	OR ANYBODY THAT'S LIKE REALLY CLOSE OR REALLY INVOLVED WITHIN DANCE MARATHON IT BE ANOTHER WAY JUST TO BASICALLY JUST LIKE GIVE A PRIZE TO WHOEVER RECRUITS THE MOST AMOUNT OF PEOPLE OR SOMETHING JUST TO REWARD THEM FOR EVERYTHING THAT THEY HAVE DONE FOR THE SUCCESSFUL DAY
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00029	SO WHAT IS THE REASON TO JOIN WELL THERE'S ALWAYS SO MANY DIFFERENT REASONS TO JOIN BUT SOME FEW BIG ONES IS A SOCIAL CAUSE CAUSE CONNECTION ACADEMIC OR PROFESSIONAL RESUME BUILDER FOR LEADERSHIP AND EXPERIENCE
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00030	SO FOR ME MINE WAS ALWAYS A CAUSE CONNECTION IN HIGH SCHOOL WE HAD A STUDENT IN MY GRADE THAT HAD LUKEMIA CANCER AND WE ALWAYS TRIED TO FUNDRAISE
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00031	AND I ALWAYS WANTED TO CONTINUE SOMEHOW TO FUND RAISE FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA STATE FAMILY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00033	DOES THIS WORK IT WORKS YES IT DOES UM SO WE STARTED THIS ABOUT IN THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00034	UM THAT'S KIND OF WHEN WE JUST DECIDED HEY LET'S DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO REGISTER AND GET UM AS MANY PEOPLE AS WE CAN FROM WORKFORCE TO JOIN THIS ORGANIZATION UM IN OH OKAY
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00035	SO IN TO TWENTY TWENTY SLASH TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND WE RECRUITED TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO PARTICIPANTS AND WE HAD THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY OVERALL
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00036	AND THEN IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO WE RECRUITED THREE HUNDRED PARTICIPANTS ON THAT DAY AND HAD ONLY THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE TOTAL TOTAL
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00037	SO OUR REGISTRATION FIRST DAY IS OUR FIRST EVENT OF THE YEAR SO BASICALLY WE'RE NOT FUNDRAISING AT ALL ANY MONEY OR ANYTHING FOR OUR DONOR DRIVES WE ARE JUST SO LATELY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET THE MOST PEOPLE INVOLVED
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00038	AND WITH OUR ORGANIZATION ON CAMPUS AND IT IS A SURPRISE
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00039	AND ONLY THE EXECUTIVE TO KNOW SO IT'S KIND OF LIKE A SPUR OF THE MOMENT OH THERE'S THIS INVOLVEMENT FAIR WE CAN SIGN UP THERE OR OH WE'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE A BIG PARTY ON CAMPUS LAWN THAT KIND OF STUFF
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00041	SO HOW DOES IT HELP MY PROGRAM SO OUR FUNDRAISING IMPROVED TREMENDOUSLY ON CHILDREN'S HEALTH DAY IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN WE'RE ONLY FUNDRAISING ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00042	AND THEN IN CHILDREN'S HEALTH DAY AND TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY WE FUNDRAISED SIX THOUSAND AND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE DOLLARS AND TWENTY NINE CENTS WE WERE SECOND IN IOWA FOR FUNDRAISING TWENTY SECOND IN THE NATION FOR FUNDRAISING AND SECOND IN OUR TIER
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00043	AND THEN ON CHILDREN'S HEALTH DAY IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE FUNRAISED EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND THEN FOR THE WEEK WE DID FUNDRAISE FIFTEEN HUNDRED
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00045	SO SOME OTHER THINGS THAT WE ALSO USE ARE THESE GRAPHICS SO ON THE LEFT WE HAVE A QR CODE WE HAVE THIS POSTED ON OUR SOCIAL MEDIA A LOT
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00046	AND ALSO WE PRINT THEM OUT AND HAVE IT POSTED THROUGHOUT OUR CAMPUS SO IT'S EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO SCAN IT ON THEIR PHONE INSTEAD OF CHECKING THEIR EMAILS ALIVE AND THEN WE ALSO DO ON THE RIGHT THROUGHOUT THE DAY WE JUST WANT TO THANK OUR
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00048	PARTICIPANTS THAT HAVE SIGNED UP SO FAR AND WE USUALLY SEND THEM OUT AN EMAIL THANKING THEM AND WE ALSO SEND IT OUT ON OUR SOCIAL MEDIA POSTED THERE
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00050	ANY OTHER THINGS THAT WE USUALLY DO TO IMPLEMENT ON REGISTRATION PUSH DAY
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00051	IS WE USUALLY HAVE LIKE ON CAMPUS LAW THERE'S A WHOLE UM THERE'S GAMES THAT GET PLAYED JUST A REALLY INTERACTIVE SPACE FOR PEOPLE ON CAMPUS JUST TO COME AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON
YTB+ZF1phx3L0Es+00052	UM WE USUALLY HAVE LIKE UH MUSIC BEING PLAYED SO IT'S KIND OF LOUD ACT CAMPUS TRYING TO DRAW ATTENTION TO PEOPLE THAT TYPE OF STUFF
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00002	HELLO EVERYONE HEYING UM THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING THIS WORKSHOP AND UM FOR ORGANIZING THIS EVENT UH IT'S REALLY EXCITING TO HAVE ALL OF YOU HERE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00003	UM SO I JUST WANTED TO UH BRIEFLY INTRODUCE MYSELF
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00004	UH I AM LAUREN AND AS UH AS MARTIN SAID I'M THE CEO AND UH CO FOUNDER OF ANIMAL ADVOCACY CARES UM MY BACKGROUND IS IN CLIENT CONSULTANCY SO I WAS WORKING FOR A GLOBAL MARKET RESEARCH COMPANY AND I AM NOW IN THE NON PROFIT WORLD
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00005	UM SO HOPEFULLY I CAN UH GIVE UH GIVE YOU ALL SOME GUIDANCE ON HOW TO NAVIGATE THAT SITUATION UM SO CAN EVERYONE SEE MY SCREEN UM KIND OF LIKE A BUMPS UP IF WE CAN SEE THE SCREEN
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00006	WONDERFUL THANK YOU THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING WELL SO FAR AND EASILY CRIB ABOUT THIS TECHNICAL STUFF OKAY SO WE GO FOR UH THIS WORKSHOP
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00007	IS UM THAT WE WILL ALL LEAVE THE WORKSHOP WITH AT LEAST ONE NEW RESOURCE CONNECTION IDEA OR ACTION THAT WE CAN TAKE AWAY TO HELP YOU PROGRESS YOUR CAREER
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00009	AND SO THE IDEA OF THE WORKSHOP ITSELF IS TO DISCUSS HOW TO USE YOUR CAREER MORE EFFECTIVELY AND TO ESSENTIALLY HELP MORE ANIMALS THROUGH YOUR CAREER
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00010	UM BUT IN ORDER THAT WE DO THIS IT'S ACTUALLY VITAL TO SPEND SOME TIME ACTUALLY PLANNING THIS UM AND THERE'S TWO REASONS FOR THIS UH THE FIRST ONE IS BECAUSE NOT ALL ULTRAISTIC UM ACTIONS ARE EQUAL
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00011	AND THE SECONDLY IS THAT UM SOMETIME THINKING OR PLANNING COULD ACTUALLY MULTIPLY THE IMPACT YOU HAVE BY UP TO TEN TO ONE HUNDRED TIMES WHICH IS QUITE A LOT
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00012	UM SO I'M JUST GOING TO SAY OKAY HERE IS A SUMMARY OF WHAT THE SESSION WILL ENTAIL
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00013	I WILL BE DOING A TWENTY MINUTE PRESENTATION GOING THROUGH DIFFERENT STEPS OF THE CAREER DECISION MAKING PROCESS AND OUTLINING AVAILABLE RESOURCES WHICH YOU CAN LOOK INTO IN MORE DETAIL AFTER THE PRESENTATION
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00014	UM THEN WE'LL DO FIVE TO TEN MINUTES OF INTROSPECTION SO I WANT YOU ALL TO SIT THERE AND AND KIND OF LIKE JUST JOT DOWN SOME OF YOUR KEY UNCERTAINTIES OR SPECIFIC AREAS THAT YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00015	UM THEN I AM GOING TO GIVE YOU SOME FINAL RESOURCES THAT YOU CAN AGAIN TAKE AWAY AND DO SOME MORE LIKE PLANNING UM THEN YOU'RE GOING TO JOIN A GROUP
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00016	WE'RE GOING TO ALL JUST KIND OF LIKE DISCUSS UM UM AND MARTIN IS GOING TO VERY KINDLY ASSIGN YOU ALL TO DIFFERENT GROUPS WITH DIFFERENT INSTRUCTIONS AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO FINISH WITH A Q AND A SESSION
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00018	OKAY UH SO A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT ANIMAL ADVOCACY CARES UM AS AS WE SAID UM IT WAS CREATED TO HELP UH INDIVIDUALS MAXIMIZE THEIR POTENTIAL AND THEIR POSITIVE IMPACT FOR ANIMALS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00019	UM I GUESS THERE ARE MANY WAYS THAT WE CAN THINK ABOUT HOW AN INDIVIDUAL MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO HELPING ANIMALS UH ONE MIGHT BE THAT AN INDIVIDUAL MIGHT MAKE A DIETARY CHANGE LIKE A VEGAN OR VEGETARIAN
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00020	BUT ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE ARE MOST EXCITED ANIMAL ADVOCACY CAREERS THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN MAKE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT FOR ANIMALS IS THROUGH UTILIZING OUR CAREER
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00021	IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED THROUGH RESEARCH THAT MOST INDIVIDUALS SPEND APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY THOUSAND HOURS OF THEIR TIME
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00022	AND THEIR LIVES IN A CAREER SO IT KIND OF MAKES SENSE AND A KEY FACTOR WHERE INDIVIDUALS CAN MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE TO ANIMALS WOULD BE TO UTILIZE THEIR CAREER TO HELP AS MANY ANIMALS AS POSSIBLE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00023	AND WITH SUCH A BIG OPPORTUNITY AT STAKE IT'S ARGUABLY OUR DUTY TO SPEND SOME REAL TIME THINKING THROUGH OUR OPPORTUNITIES AND THINKING THROUGH A CONCRETE STRATEGY OF HOW WE CAN HELP IN THE HOW WE CAN HELP ACTUAL INDIVIDUAL ANIMALS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00024	UM THROUGH ACAREERS IT MIGHT SEEM A LITTLE BORING SOME PEOPLE MIGHT THINK IT'S OVERWHELMING AND SLIGHTLY MELODRAMATIC BUT IF WE ACTUALLY TAKE THROUGH A SCENARIO WHERE WE MAYBE WOULD HAVE TWO JOB OPPORTUNITIES I THINK WE COULD MAYBE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00025	UH TALK THROUGH THIS A LITTLE BIT MORE SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU MIGHT HAVE A JOB OPPORTUNITY WHERE IT'S THE FIRST ONE THAT COMES TO YOU AND IT WOULD ENABLE YOU TO HELP A HUNDRED ANIMALS OVER THE COURSE OF FIVE YEARS OF YOUR CAREER
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00026	BUT HAD YOU WAITED FOR TWO WEEKS LONGER THEN YOU WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE THE CHANCE TO HAVE TEN TIMES THAT AMOUNT OF ANIMALS IN THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00027	AS YOU CAN SEE THERE CAN BE VERY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES TO YOU BEING ABLE TO MAKE AN IMPACT JUST THROUGH A SMALL CHOICE THAT YOU WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00028	UM SO ONE OF THE THE THE THE PROBLEMS IS THERE'S DISPARITY BETWEEN OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDIVIDUAL IMPACT AND WE ALSO HAVE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00029	SO IT MAKES SENSE THAT WE TRY AND THINK THROUGH OUR OPTIONS AND PRIORITIZE THEM ALL ACCORDINGLY SO THAT WE CAN ASSESS OPPORTUNITIES WHEN THEY ARRIVE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00031	SO WHERE DO WE BEGIN WITH THIS UM MOST OF THIS IS LIFTED FROM AN EXCELLENT ARTICLE ON OUR WEBSITE WHICH I WOULD ALL SAY I WOULD RECOMMEND TO EVERYBODY
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00032	WHICH IS CALLED HOW TO MAKE UH TOUGH CAREER OPTIONS UM SORRY HOW TO MAKE TOUGH CAREER DECISIONS UM SO THIS WILL HELP US TO BUILD A REALLY STRONG FRAMEWORK FOR PRIORITIZATION
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00033	UM FOR FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES AND ALSO PLAN OUT OUR STRATEGY TO MAXIMIZE OUR IMPACT SO STEP ONE IS TO CLARIFY THE DECISION THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO TO
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00034	MAKE UM SO WE WANT TO HAVE A CLEAR IDEA OF EXACTLY WHAT IT IS THAT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE THROUGH OUR CAREER UM STRATEGIC PLANNING
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00035	UM SO FOR IT MIGHT BE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL THAT YOU MIGHT BE CHOOSING BETWEEN TWO CONCRETE JOB OPPORTUNITIES
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00036	UM SOME PEOPLE MIGHT BE WANTING TO DO LONG TERM CAREER STRATEGY
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00037	BUT FOR THE SAKE OF THIS WORKSHOP AND THE WIDEST APPLICABILITY WE'RE GOING TO UH CONSIDER COMING UP WITH MORE OF OUR LIKE MEDIUM TERM OPTIONS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00039	AND SO FOR IF WE'RE TAKING MEDIUM TERM THEN WE START TO THINK ABOUT ONE OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT PRIORITIES FOR THIS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00040	UM SO THIS WILL OBVIOUSLY BE QUITE INDIVIDUAL AND IT WILL BE VERY UNIQUE TO SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS ON THEIR PRIORITIES
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00041	BUT UM SOME OF THE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE WRITTEN DOWN HERE WOULD HELP AN INDIVIDUAL TO REALLY TRY AND MAXIMIZE UM THEIR THEIR POTENTIAL THROUGH THAT CAREER
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00042	SO THE FIRST IS IMPACT POTENTIAL THEN WE HAVE PERSONAL FITS UM CAREER CAPITAL OPTION VALUE VALUE OF INFORMATION
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00043	AND I'M GOING TO GO THROUGH EACH OF THESE IN SLIGHTLY MORE DETAIL TO TRY AND REMOVE THE JARGON AND ALSO TO GIVE YOU ALL SOME RESOURCES SO THAT YOU CAN LOOK THEM UP INDIVIDUALLY AFTERWARDS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00045	SO THE FIRST AND ARGUABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT IS ACTUALLY IMPACT POTENTIAL SO HOW MUCH IMPACT POTENTIAL DO YOU HAVE WITH EACH OF THE JOB OPPORTUNITIES THAT YOU ARE CONSIDERING
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00047	THIS IS PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS OF IT UM AND EXCELLENT GUIDE FOR THIS IS THE CENTER FOR EFFECTIVE ALTRUISM RESOURCES PAGE WHICH GOES THROUGH THIS IN A LOT MORE UH IN A LOT MORE DETAIL
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00048	UM BECAUSE A LOT OF IT COMES DOWN TO CAUSE PRIORITIZATION I'M ASSUMING THAT MOST OF US HERE ARE THINKING ABOUT
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00049	TRYING TO HELP ANIMALS UM BUT THEN FROM THAT YOU ARE ALSO RESTRICTED BY BY THE SPECIFIC THE CAUSE THAT YOU'RE THAT YOUR FOCUS ON SO IT COULD BE THAT YOU UM
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00050	THAT THE THE NEXT PARTICULAR THING WOULD BE THAT YOU HAVE TO DECIDE BETWEEN EITHER FOCUSING ON COMPANION ANIMALS OR FARMED ANIMALS UM AN EXCELLENT RESOURCE FOR THAT IS ANIMAL CHARITY VALUE AS WHY FARMED ANIMALS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00051	THEY ALSO HAVE CHARITY REVIEWS AND INTERVENTION REVIEWS AS WELL BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S NOT JUST THE FACT THAT YOU BE UM CONSIDERING CROSS PRIORITIZATION
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00052	BUT YOU ALSO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT SPECIFICALLY UM WHAT KIND OF ROLE THAT YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY BE THINKING ABOUT OR CONSIDERING AND HOW MUCH IMPACT POTENTIAL THAT ROLE HAS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00054	SO THE NEXT TERMS THAT WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT ARE PERSONAL FITS PERSONAL SATISFACTION CAREER CAPITAL OPTION VALUE AND VALUE OF INFORMATION
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00055	SO I'VE BUCKETED A LOT INTO THIS ONE SECTION BUT THE REASON IS BECAUSE A LOT OF THE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE ON THIS ARE VERY SIMILAR
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00056	SO WE'VE GOT UM EIGHT THOUSAND HOURS CAREER VIEWS WHICH GO THROUGH THIS IN A LOT MORE DETAIL SOME OF THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE AT A C LIKE THE SKILLS PROFILES
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00057	WE'LL GO THROUGH UM AND INCLUDE SOME TIPS FOR THINGS LIKE PERSONAL FIT UM AND WE ALSO HAVE A A GLOSSARY OF TERMS TO GO THROUGH THESE IN IN MORE DETAIL
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00058	BUT ESSENTIALLY WE JUST NEED TO THINK ABOUT EACH ONE OF THESE FACTORS AND HOW IMPORTANT IT ACTUALLY IS UM BUT TO REMEMBER THEM WHEN WE'RE CONSIDERING CAREER OPPORTUNITIES SO THAT WE'RE ABLE TO ADEQUATELY PRIORITIZE BETWEEN OPPORTUNITIES
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00060	SO THERE'S THERE'S SOME INDIVIDUAL RESEARCH YOU CAN DO AS WELL WHICH IS MOSTLY JUST GOOGLING LOOKING THROUGH RESOURCES BUT ANOTHER REALLY UH GOOD WAY TO ACTUALLY FIND OUT SOME MORE INFORMATION IS TO UM ASK INDIVIDUALS THAT YOU MIGHT KNOW ALREADY
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00061	SO WHEN YOU HAVE TO SOME JOB OPPORTUNITIES THAT YOU MIGHT BE THINKING ABOUT TO GO THROUGH THESE DIFFERENT METRICS AND ASK INDIVIDUALS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00062	WHAT THEY THINK UM THE CAREER THE CAREER CAPITAL OPPORTUNITIES ARE THE OPTION VALUE OR THE VALUE OF INFORMATION
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00064	UM SO WE WE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT LIKE INDIVIDUAL POTENTIAL SO THAT'S LIKE THE INDIVIDUAL METRICS AND HOW EACH OPPORTUNITY MIGHT HELP YOU AS AN INDIVIDUAL TO PROGRESS YOUR CAREER FOR ANIMALS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00065	UM THE NEXT THING THAT WE WANT TO THINK ABOUT IS COMMUNITY SO UM WE WANT TO ALSO CONSIDER THE FACT THAT EACH ONE OF THESE JOB OPPORTUNITIES HAS SIGNIFICANT IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SIGNIFICANTLY HELP THE COMMUNITY IN IN TWO WAYS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00066	ONE IS TO CONSIDER OUR RELATIVE FIT OR OUR COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE SO UM HOW WE WOULD COMPARE TO SOMEBODY ELSE WHO WOULD ALSO BE TAKING THAT OPPORTUNITY
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00067	AND THE SECOND IS COMMUNITY CAPITAL SO HOW DO WE AS AN INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTE TO THE WIDER COMMUNITY BY THE ROLE THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY TAKING
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00068	UM AND THE THESE ARE QUITE IMPORTANT ASPECTS AND CAN REALLY SHIFT UM HOW MUCH IMPACT ONE COULD HAVE FROM TWO OPPORTUNITIES THAT YOU MIGHT BE CONSIDERING
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00069	BUT IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TO ACTUALLY ASSESS THIS BY THEMSELVES SO WE ARE A C HAVE HAVE SPENT A LITTLE BIT OF TIME THIS YEAR TRYING TO HELP INDIVIDUALS REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00070	UM THROUGH TWO THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE ONE IS THE ANIMAL ADVOCACY SPOT CHECK AND THE SECOND IS OUR TALLY BOTTLENECK SURVEY
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00071	SO BOTH OF THESE WERE CONDUCTED TO HELP INDIVIDUALS UM UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THIS THERE'S UM SOME VARIOUS LIMITATIONS TO THE SPOT CHECK WHICH MY CODE FOUNDER UH JAMIE CONDUCTED
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00072	UH ONE THAT YOU NEED TO BE AWARE ABOUT UH AWARE OF IS THAT THEY ARE JUST CURRENTLY FILLED ROLES AND UH THE ONES THAT WERE CURRENTLY ADVERTISED
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00073	IT'S ALSO JUST A SNAPSHOT OF A SPECIFIC PERIOD OF TIME AND WE'RE HOPING THAT IN FUTURE WE'LL ALSO BE ABLE TO RETROSPECTIVELY GO BACK AND COMPARE THE TWO
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00074	BUT SOME NOTABLE POINTS WHICH MIGHT BE WORTH CONSIDERING WAS THAT BOTH FUNDRAISING AND OPERATIONS ROLES WERE OVERREPRESENTED IN THE ADVERTISED OPPORTUNITIES COMPARED TO THE CURRENT ROLES
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00075	THIS SUGGESTS THAT FILLING ROLES IS DIFFICULT FOR EFFECTIVE ANIMAL ADVOCACY NON PROFITS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00076	AND IT ALSO PROVIDES WEAK EVIDENCE THAT OPERATIONS EXPERTISE IS A BOTTLENECK FOR EFFECTIVE ANIMAL ADVOCACY NONPROFITS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00077	AND THE SECOND WAS THAT CAMPAIGN ROLES AND RESEARCH ROLES WERE BOTH SLIGHTLY UNDERREPRESENTED IN JOB AD
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00078	THIS MUCH IS OUR IMPRESSION THAT THESE ROLES ARE GENERALLY POPULAR AND OVERSUBSCRIBED UM IN THE JOB SPECIFICATIONS FOR ADVERTISED JOB ROLES COMMUNICATION SKILLS AND ENGLISH LANGUAGE WERE FREQUENTLY REQUESTED AS IMPORTANT
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00079	AND REMOTE WORK WAS COMMON BUT FLEXIBILITY BY COUNTRY REVENUE OF OF RESIDENCY WAS NOT
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00080	UM MOST JOBS REQUIRED EXPERIENCE AND RELATED TYPES OF ROLES SO THE AVERAGE ROLE UM THE AVERAGE FOR THIS WAS ABOUT ONE POINT EIGHT YEARS OF EXPERIENCE TO UH WAS REQUIRED IN EACH ONE OF THESE JOB ROLES
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00082	AND SO THE SECOND THING WE DID WAS UH CONDUCT THE UH THE THIS TIME LAST YEAR I'M LATELY UM TWELVE C'S AND HIRING PROFESSIONALS FROM NINE OF THE TEN UH STAND OUT UM CURRENTLY LISTED ON ANIMAL CHARITY VALUATORS PAGE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00083	UM FORMERLY OR NOW UM AND THAT WAS ASKING THE ORGANIZATIONS LIKE WHAT BOTTLENECK DO YOU MOST IDENTIFY AT THE ORGANIZATIONS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00084	AS YOU CAN SEE OVERWHELMINGLY FUN RAISING AND UNDERSTOOD UH UNSURPRISINGLY FUNDING WAS THE MAJOR UH TALENT BOTTLENECK WHICH AGAIN IS SORRY THE MAJOR BOTTLENECK FOR ORGANIZATIONS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00085	BUT INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS SAID THAT THEY WOULD PRIORITIZE HIRING FUNDRAISERS UM IN FUTURE RATHER THAN JUST HAVING THE DONATIONS THEMSELVES AND THAT WAS UM TO ENABLE THEM TO HAVE MORE OF A SUSTAINABLE CASH FLOW
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00086	UM SO SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS MATCHED UP QUITE WELL UM THE THE SERVICE THAT WE LED VERSUS THE SPOT CHECK
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00087	UM AND OTHER THINGS WERE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT UM SO IN THE IN THIS FOR FOR EXAMPLE THERE WAS QUITE A LOT OF MENTION OF PEOPLE STRUGGLING TO HIRE SENIOR MANAGERS AND LEADERS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00088	AND WHICH INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH WAS ALSO IN THE PHONETICS UH SURVEY THAT JUST RECENTLY CAME OUT UM BUT IT WASN'T MATCHED IN THE SPOT CHECK SO THAT'S EITHER UM AN ISSUE WITH OUR SPOT CHECK OR JUST LIKE A
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00089	SOME RANDOM VARIANTS THE UM THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT WE CAN TRY AND GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR KEY BUSINESS NETWORK SO THAT WHEN INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE OPTION WHERE ALL ELSE BEING EQUAL ON AN INDIVIDUAL LEVEL THE TWO OPTIONS ARE SIMILAR
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00090	THAT YOU CAN HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE IMPACT FOR ANIMALS BY TAKING AN OPPORTUNITY WHERE THERE'S A KEY TALKING BOTTLENECK IN THE UH ANIMAL ADVOCACY COMMUNITY
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00091	THIS IS THE OTHER ONE THAT IS UH WHERE WHERE YOUR COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE IS IS MINIMALLY
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00093	AND AGAIN THESE TERMS ARE ON OUR WEBSITE ON OUR GLOSSARY OF UM TERMS IF THAT'S HELPFUL FOR PEOPLE UM SO YOU'VE GOT THOSE TWO WHICH I'VE JUST DISCUSSED WITH YOU UM THERE AGAIN I WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO ASK INDIVIDUALS THAT YOU MIGHT KNOW
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00094	UM ABOUT WHAT THEY THINK THEIR KEY POSITIONS ARE OR TO ASK PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THESE ROLES LIKE IF THEY THINK THAT UM
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00095	THAT THEY'RE PARTICULARLY OVER OR UNDER SUBSCRIBES UM BUT JUST GENERALLY ASKING MORE PEOPLE UM AND ENCOURAGING THEM TO GIVE YOU FEEDBACK ON ON YOUR COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE IN COMPARISON TO OTHER PEOPLE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00096	UM IS REALLY GOOD UM AT THE END OF THIS YEAR WE'LL ALSO BE TRYING TO LOOK INTO SOME MORE RESEARCH MAYBE ABOUT QUALITY ADJUSTED STAFF MEMBERS AND HOW MUCH INCREMENTAL
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00097	INCREMENTAL UM IMPACT INDIVIDUALS CAN HAVE BUT THAT'S NOT UNTIL THE END OF THIS YEAR SO FEEL FREE TO REACH OUT TO PEOPLE UNTIL
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00099	OKAY SO I'VE TALKED QUITE A LOT NOW UM AND NOW MY SCREEN HAS DECIDED TO DO THAT SO I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT THAT UH SO THE NEXT PART OF THE PRESENTATION IS THAT WE WANT TO GENERATE SOME MORE OPTIONS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00100	UM SO THE THE IDEA NOW IS THAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH STEP ONE UH WHICH IS TO CLARIFY OUR DECISION WE'VE GONE THROUGH STEP TWO WHICH IS TO THINK ABOUT OUR KEY PRIORITIES
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00101	AND OUR THIRD UM THAT WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT IS TO GENERATE SOME OPTIONS UM I KNOW PEOPLE ARE USUALLY QUITE RELUCTANT TO DO THIS AND THEY WILL USUALLY COME UP WITH ONE OR TWO BUT I WANT TO TRY AND ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY TO THINK OF AS MANY OPTIONS AS THEY CAN
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00102	UM BECAUSE IT TENDS TO BE THE SITUATION THAT WE UNDER UM
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00103	COME UP WITH OPTIONS RATHER THAN OVERCOME UP WITH OPTIONS AND UH THE THE ONES THAT YOU FIRST COME UP WITH ARE NEVER THE BEST ONES SO YOU NEED TO KEEP THINKING UM I'M GOING TO PUT UP A FEW UH OPTIONS HERE THAT PEOPLE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00104	UM SO YOU COULD WORK FOR A NONPROFIT YOU COULD WORK FOR AN ANIMAL UH FREE FROM COMPANY YOU COULD WORK IN THE MANAGEMENT OR LEADERSHIP
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00105	LOBBYING START A NEW CHARITY WORK IN THE LEGAL SPACE MARKETING OR COMMUNICATIONS UM AND ALL OF THESE UH RESOURCES I'M PUTTING UP HERE WILL MAYBE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00106	TRY AND HELP AND ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK OF IT MAYBE INSPIRE YOU TO THINK OF SOME MORE OPTIONS AND I THINK THAT WE SHOULD ALL JUST TAKE A FEW MINUTES NOW TO UH TO THINK ABOUT THESE UM OPTIONS SO I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU UM
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00107	TWO OR THREE MINUTES MAYBE UM JUST TO THINK ABOUT SOME MORE OPTIONS THAT EACH OF US COULD THINK ABOUT TO HAVE MORE IMPACT FOR ANIMALS AND THE IDEA HERE IS SOME REALLY ROUGH BRAINSTORMING
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00108	THINKING ABOUT DIFFERENT OPTIONS AND UM AND THEN WE WILL GO ON TO THE NEXT STAGE BUT I'M GOING TO PAUSE FOR A SECOND SO EVERYONE THINK ABOUT YOUR OPTIONS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00111	ALSO GREEN TO YOU UH PROMPTS AND TIPS ON THE NEXT SCREEN HELP YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR OPTIONS UM
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00113	BUT A LITTLE BIT OF INSPIRATION UM
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00115	SO OBVIOUSLY THAT WASN'T ENOUGH TIME FOR YOU ALL TO GENERATE AS MANY OPTIONS AS IS POSSIBLE FOR EACH OF YOU BUT HOPEFULLY IT'S GIVEN YOU SOME INSPIRATION OR AT LEAST STARTED TO MAKE YOU THINK ABOUT MORE OPTIONS THAT ARE POTENTIAL FOR YOU
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00116	UM SO AFTER THIS THE NEXT STEP THAT WE WANT TO TAKE IS RANKING THESE OPTIONS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00117	UM SO I'LL I'LL SHARE THESE SLIDES UM ON THE FACEBOOK GROUP AFTERWARDS SO THAT YOU CAN ALL LIKE SPEND SOME SOME REAL TIME THINKING ABOUT THEM BUT THE IDEA IS JUST TO TRY AND GET YOU
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00118	UH INTO THE SPACE OF GENERATING SOME MORE OPTIONS UM THE NEXT STEP IS TO RANK YOUR OPTIONS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00119	UM SO AGAIN I WANT YOU TO DO JUST LIKE A REALLY ROUGH INITIAL RANKING OF YOUR OPTIONS THROUGH THROUGH JUST INTROSPECTION UM AND NOT TRY TO THINK TOO MUCH ABOUT IT UM BUT THE THE IDEA WOULD BE TO TAKE THOSE UM
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00120	TAKE ALL THE PRIORITIES THAT WE DISCUSSED IN STEP TWO AND THINK ABOUT THE OPTIONS THAT WE'VE JUST GENERATED AND RANK THEM AGAINST EACH OTHER SO WHICH ONES SEEM LIKE THE LIKELY
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00121	UM HIGHEST OPPORTUNITY JUST BASED ON INTUITION AND NOT THROUGH DOING ANY RESEARCH OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT WHERE WE THINK EACH ONE OF THOSE OPTIONS MAYBE WOULD COME UM THROUGH THE THROUGH THE RANKING
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00123	AND AGAIN I'M JUST GIVING YOU ALL OF THE THE PRIORITIES THAT WE PUT THERE UM AND I WILL JUST LEAVE THEM ON AND IF YOU CAN CAN JUST REALLY QUICKLY LOOK AT THOSE OPTIONS THAT YOU'VE JUST DONE AND UH AND RANK THEM UM AGAINST THOSE DIFFERENT RATIOS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00125	OKAY UM SO NOW MAYBE ONE OF THE MOST UH PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT THINGS IS TO LIST OUR KEY UNCERTAINTIES
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00126	UM SO THE IDEA IS THAT IF YOU'VE ACTUALLY GONE THROUGH THIS WORKSHOP WITH ME AND YOU'VE DONE AS I'VE SAID UM THEN YOU CAN GET TO THE POINT NOW WHERE YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN THINKING IN THE LAST STAGES LIKE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00127	WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT WHAT ARE YOUR RESERVATIONS LIKE WHAT ARE REALLY HOLDING YOU BACK FROM BEING ABLE TO DO THAT INITIAL RANKING
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00128	AND FROM UH GENERATING THOSE IDEAS UM AND THESE KEY UNCERTAINTIES ACTUALLY ARE QUITE SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00129	THEY CAN CHANGE THE ENTIRE DIMENSION OF EVERYTHING YOU'VE JUST BEEN DOING SO YOU CAN THINK ABOUT THINGS AND THINK OKAY WE I'VE GOT REALLY CONCRETE RANKING BUT WHAT ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS WHAT ARE THE KEY UNCERTAINTIES THAT YOU HAVE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00130	THAT WOULD ACTUALLY UM LIKELY CHANGE THE INITIAL UH RANKINGS THAT YOU'VE DONE UM SO AGAIN JUST LIKE TRYING TO THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY IMPORTANT AND UM I'M GOING TO PAUSE NOW FOR FIVE MINUTES AND LET YOU THINK
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00131	REALLY CONCRETELY ABOUT THOSE STEPS UM AND THEN AFTER THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO INTO BREAKOUT ROOMS WHICH UH MARTINS CAN HELP ME TO ASSIGN UM AND JUST TO UH WE'RE GOING TO PUT YOU IN DIFFERENT GROUPS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00132	UM DEPENDING ON ON WHERE YOU GET ASSIGNED YOU WILL HAVE A KIND OF LIKE AN ASSIGNMENT FOR THAT BUT IF WE CAN SPEND FIVE MINUTES NOW INDIVIDUALLY JUST THINKING ABOUT ALL THESE THINGS UM AND I WILL LEAVE SOME TIPS ON THE SCREEN AGAIN UM SO THAT YOU CAN YOU CAN HAVE SOME TIME TO THINK
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00134	SO SORRY FOR THE MESSAGE LORIAN IT WAS NOT AS EASY AS I THOUGHT I COULD NOT ALL THE INFORMATION BROADCAST SO IT TOOK ME SOME TIME TO FIGURE IT OUT BUT I HOPE IT WAS DELIVERED
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00135	YEAH I WELL I HOPE IT WAS AS USUAL AS I GOT TO SPEAK TO SOMEONE AND SHE WAS QUITE FANTASTIC SO I HOPE THAT EVERYONE ELSE UM HAD HAD A GOOD TIME
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00136	CAN I JUST CHECK THE UM CAN YOU SEE MY SCREEN OR NOX I'M NOT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SURE AT THIS THIS POINT
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00137	WE CAN SEE YOU BUT NOT YOUR SCREEN
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00138	CAN YOU LEAVE THE MANUALS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00139	SLIGHTLY UNHEALTHY OKAY ANYWAY I'VE GOT IT I THINK UM I DON'T THINK I HAVE THE ACCESS ANYMORE TO TO SHARE IT BUT ANYWAY
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00140	WE WERE JUST GOING TO ME OVER OVER TO THE Q AND A SESSION AND I JUST WANTED TO TO SAY BEFORE WE DID THAT
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00141	THAT HOPEFULLY PEOPLE HAVE FOUND THE UH THE WORKSHOP REALLY USEFUL AND
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00142	OR MARGINALLY USEFUL UM AND GOT SOMETHING OUT OF IT UM I JUST WANTED TO TO SAY THAT WE DO HAVE MORE RESOURCES AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE AND WE ALSO HAVE UH TWO THINGS THAT PEOPLE CAN DO FOLLOWING THIS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00143	UM SO ONE IS APPLIED FOR OUR ONE TO ONE CAREER ADVISING UM COURSE AND IN THAT PEOPLE WILL FAIL AN APPLICATION FOR A PROCESS WHICH SEEMS QUITE ARDUOUS AND LONG BUT IS IT ACTUALLY HELPED
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00144	TRY UM IS ACTUALLY DEVELOPED TO TRY AND GET PEOPLE TO INTROSPECT A LITTLE BIT UM AND TO THINK THROUGH THEIR CAREER AND THEN WE CAN USE THAT AS A FORM FOR FOR THE CALL AS WELL
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00145	AND THEN THE SECOND IS THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE DOING UH AN INTRODUCTORY COURSE UM AT THE END OF THIS UM WELL ACTUALLY IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS TIME AND THAT IS JUST TO HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE EFFECT OF ANIMAL
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00146	AND THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE AND THEN WE WILL DO A MORE STRUCTURED AND DETAILED WORKSHOP THAN THE ONE THAT YOU HAD TODAY SO YOU CAN ALSO FIND THAT ON OUR
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00147	BUT I THINK THAT'S PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING FROM FROM MY SIDE IF WE WON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS THAT WE CAN FIRE AWAY
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00149	GREAT THANK YOU LAUREN SO NOW WE CAN OPEN Q AND A SESSION WE HAVE TWELVE MINUTES OR OR ALMOST TWELVE MINUTES I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND YOU TO NOT ASK THE QUESTION DIRECTLY KEEP YOUR MIC MUTED
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00150	AND PULSE YOUR QUESTIONS TO SLIDE OH YOU SHOULD FIND THE LINK TO SLIDE OH UH YOU SHOULD FIND THE LINK TO SLIDE OH UH IN THE CHAT AND IT WILL BE PUT THERE AGAIN IN A FEW MOMENTS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00151	AND WE ALREADY HAVE TWO QUESTIONS THERE SO LET'S START WITH THE FIRST QUESTION UH HI IS IT POSSIBLE TO WORK AS AN INDEPENDENT RESEARCHER WITHIN EAA
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00152	LIKE APPLYING FOR FUNDING TO DO RESEARCH PROJECTS AS AN INDIVIDUAL INDIVIDUAL RATHER THAN WITH AN ORGANIZATION
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00154	I'M REALLY SORRY COULD YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00155	OKAY ABOUT THAT SO IT'S POSSIBLE TO WORK WORK AS AN INDEPENDENT RESEARCHER WITHIN THE EFFECTIVE UH ANIMAL ADVOCACY
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00156	THAT MEANS APPLYING FOR FUNDING TO DO RESEARCH PROJECTS AS AN INDIVIDUAL RATHER THAN WITH AN ORGANIZATION
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00158	YEAH I THINK THAT THAT WOULD DEFINITELY BE UM A POTENTIAL OPTION UM I THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME FUNDING RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS AND I THINK IT WOULD IT WOULD REALLY
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00159	SPECIFICALLY DEPEND ON WHAT PROJECT IT WAS THAT YOU WERE TRYING TO RESEARCH UM BUT THERE ARE DEFINITELY SOME SOME GRANT MAKING BODIES AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT WILL FUND INDIVIDUALS TO TO RESEARCH
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00160	PARTICULARLY ON UM PRIORITY AREAS I THINK THE EFFECTIVE ANIMAL UM THE EFFECTIVE ULTIMATE UM
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00161	COMMUNITY DOES YOU YOU FIND THESE THINGS I'VE HEARD OF PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT I HOPE THAT ANSWERS THE QUESTION BUT IF YOU HAVE A FOLLOWER FEEL FREE TO ASK
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00163	OKAY NEXT QUESTION FROM HAVEN UH WHAT WAS YOUR CAREER PET BEFORE LAUNCHING THIS NEW COOL ORGANIZATION
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00164	THANKS ADAM UH YEAH SO MY CAREER PATH BEFORE BEFORE THIS IS I I'VE WORKED IN THE FOUR PROFIT WORLD FOR UM ALMOST TEN YEARS BEFORE I DID THIS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00165	UM AND I WORKED AS A CLIENT MANAGER UM AND THEN ENDED UP IN A CONSULTANCY UM AND WHEN I WAS DOING THAT I WAS ALSO VOLUNTEERING
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00166	FOR UH EFFECTIVE ANIMAL AFFINITY ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE HUMAN LEAGUE AND THE GOOD FOOD INSTITUTE AND I REALLY ENJOYED THAT WORK THAT WAS POTENTIALLY THE MOST EXCITING PART OF MY JOB EVEN THOUGH IT WASN'T MY MY JOB
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00167	AND THAT INSPIRED ME TO START CHURCH ONLINE WHICH I THINK YOU WILL ALSO ON UH AND THEN I STARTED THIS ORGANIZATION
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00169	THANK YOU THE NEXT QUESTION IS FROM OLAZARA UH WHO WOULD BENEFIT THE MOST FROM THE INDIVIDUAL CALLS THAT AAC IS PROVIDING
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00171	UM YEAH THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION I DON'T THINK THERE'S A MOST UH BUT I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00172	UM ANYBODY WHO KIND OF WANTS TO THINK A LITTLE BIT MORE IN AN INSTRUCTED WAY ABOUT THEIR CAREER
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00173	UM THE THE ACTUAL APPLICATION FORM ITSELF IS QUITE QUITE LONG UM SORRY ABOUT THAT BUT IT IS IT IS THEREFOR TO TRY AND HELP YOU GET TO GET PEOPLE TO REALLY THINK ABOUT THEIR CAREER
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00174	AND IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL I THINK FOR ANYBODY WHO IS UNCERTAIN ABOUT ANY ASPECT OF THEIR CAREER AND WOULD JUST LIKE TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT IT
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00175	UM AND WE CAN GIVE YOU FEEDBACK ON IT AND HOPEFULLY GIVE YOU SOME MORE UM TAILORED AND INDIVIDUAL RESOURCES TO TO HELP YOU WITH YOUR CAREER DECISION
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00177	THANK YOU NEXT QUESTION IS FROM MARTIN UH I APOLOGIZE IF I MISPRONOUNCED THAT UH DO YOU HAVE ANY POINTERS ON HOW TO GET HOW TO GO ABOUT ASSESSING RELATIVE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00179	UH YEAH I MEAN I THINK I THINK THAT REALLY I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO IN ASSASSIN YOUR RELATIVE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00180	FIT IS TO BE QUITE UH BRUTAL WITH YOURSELF AND IN RESPECT A LOT UM YOU COULD ALSO ASK OTHER INDIVIDUALS I KNOW SOME PEOPLE UM START THOSE ANONYMOUS FEEDBACK FORMS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00181	UM AND I KNOW BOTH MY FRIENDS HAVE ACTUALLY UM IF IF YOU'RE THE KIND OF PERSON THAT CAN TAKE FEEDBACK I DON'T WANT TO LIKE ADVISE THAT EVERYONE TO TO TRY AND GET FEEDBACK IF IT'S GOING TO AFFECT THEM NEGATIVELY UM IN THE IN THE MENTAL HEALTH
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00182	BUT IT CAN BE QUITE USEFUL TO ACTUALLY ASK PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW TO GIVE YOU TO GIVE YOU FEEDBACK SO THAT YOU CAN REALLY GET A BETTER
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00183	UM OBJECTIVE UH VIEW OF YOUR SPECIFIC SKILL SET UM AND THEN YOU CAN QUITE ACCURATELY UH PROBABLY ASSESS YOUR RELATIVE FIT ANOTHER THING THAT YOU CAN DO IS DO SOME VOLUNTEERING
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00184	UM FOR SPECIFIC ROLES THAT YOU'RE CONSIDERING UM AND THAT WILL GIVE YOU A PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF WHETHER YOU WOULD LIKE OR NOT LIKE UH THOSE ROLES I DID VOLUNTEER ONCE AS A RESEARCHER AND UM
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00185	IT DIDN'T IT DIDN'T FIT VERY WELL WITH ME SO I'M REALLY GLAD AND VERY GRATEFUL FOR MY CODE FUNDER JAMIE WHO DOES THE UH THE MORE ARDUOUS SIDE OF RESEARCH BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THAT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00186	A VERY GOOD FIT FOR ME AND PRIOR TO THAT I THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE BEEN A FANTASTIC RESEARCHER SO UM VOLUNTEERING CAN BE VERY HELPFUL
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00188	THANK YOU I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND OTHERS THAT IN SLIDE YOU CAN VOTE FOR THE QUESTIONS YOU FIND MOST INTERESTING UH IT IS A PREFERRED WAY OF DOING THIS BECAUSE WE HAVE UH SEVERAL QUESTIONS AND ONLY SEVEN MINUTES LEFT
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00189	SO WE WON'T BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THEM UH THE NEXT QUESTION IS IF YOU WANT TO WORK IN A PLAN BASED CAMPAIGNING ON AN INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00190	WHAT KIND OF UNIVERSITY DEGREE WOULD BE USEFUL OR WHAT SKILLS WOULD BE USEFUL TO LEARN
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00192	YEAH THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION AND VERY SPECIFIC UM I DON'T THINK THAT I WOULD BE THE BEST PERSON TO ASK THAT FOR BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE THAT BACKGROUND UM SO FOR ME TO TO KIND OF LIKE ANSWER THAT QUESTION WOULD PROBABLY BE MISDIRECTED
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00193	UM I THINK THAT IF YOU WERE TO USE THE COMMUNITY DIRECTORY WHICH I THINK I UH REFERENCE BEFORE THERE WILL PROBABLY BE SOMEBODY WHO ACTUALLY SPECIFICALLY WORKS IN THAT SPACE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00194	AND COULD PROBABLY TELL YOU TELL YOU ABOUT THEIR CAREER JOURNEY AND HOW THEY GOT THERE IN WHICH ONES ARE UM ARE MORE MORE USEFUL THAN OTHER ONES UM
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00196	IF THAT'S OKAY IT'S AN ANSWER
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00198	OKAY THANK YOU LET'S GET TO THE NEXT ONE DO YOU HAVE ANY TIPS FOR HOW TO CHEAPLY EXPLORE SOCIAL SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH RELATED TO EFFECTIVE ANIMAL ADVOCACY AND ALTERNATIVE PROTEIN STARTUPS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00200	AGAIN THAT'S A VERY SPECIFIC QUESTION THAT I REALLY HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT I'M REALLY SORRY UM BUT I THINK LIKE THE THE GENERAL THING WOULD BE THAT IF YOU HAVE A REALLY REALLY SPECIFIC QUESTION ABOUT UM A PARTICULAR CAREER
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00201	UM ROLL I WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO REACH OUT TO SOMEBODY WHO HAS GOT A BACKGROUND IN THAT BECAUSE THEY WILL HAVE THE THE BEST ADVICE UM AND UNFORTUNATELY AS A A NEW ORGANIZATION WE'VE ONLY BEEN GOING FOR LIKE A YEAR
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00202	WE HAVE ONLY RESEARCH INTO A SPECIFIC AREA AT THE MOMENT AND OVERALL CAREER STRATEGY AND VERY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS WOULD PROBABLY BE BETTER DIRECTED
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00203	SEE WHO HAS UM SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EXPERIENCE IN A SPECIFIC ROLE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00205	THANK YOU THE NEXT QUESTION HOW LENGTHY IS THE PROCESS INVOLVED IN APPLYING FOR INDIVIDUAL CARRIER COUNSELING CALLS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00207	COULD YOU JUST REPEAT THAT
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00208	HOW LENGTHY IS THE PROCESS INVOLVED IN APPLYING FOR INDIVIDUAL CARRIER COUNSELING CALLS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00209	YEAH SO IT'S A FIFTY FIFTY PERCENT CHANCE THAT YOU WILL GET UM YOU WILL GET ONTO THE CAREER ADVISING CALL UH THE REASON IS SO THAT WE CAN UH WE CAN ACCURATELY ASSESS WHETHER IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN USEFUL FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE CAREER ADVISING
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00210	UH THIS YEAR SO YOU IT'S IT'S NOT BASED ON THE ACTUAL APPLICATION ITSELF IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S A A GOOD OR A BAD THERE IS NO GOOD OR BAD IN THE APPLICATION IT'S IS LITERALLY RANDOM CHANCE SO
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00211	THE FIRST PERSON WILL GET EITHER ASSIGNED TO JAMIE OR MYSELF FOR A CREATOR ADVISING CALL
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00212	AND THE SECOND PERSON WILL BE ASSIGNED TO A CONTROL UH CONTROL TRIAL UM IT'S NOT LIKE UH AN APPLICATION WHERE YOU CAN GET A GOOD OR A BAD RESULT
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00214	OKAY NEXT QUESTION
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00216	UH DO THE INDIVIDUAL CALLS ASSUME THAT APPLICANTS HAVE DECIDED TO PRIORITIZE ANIMAL ADVOCACY AS A CAUSE AREA OR CAN YOU TALK ABOUT PRIORITIZATION IN THE CAUSE NOW YOU CAN DEFINITELY TALK ABOUT PRIORITIZATION AND WE WOULD
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00217	THE THE IDEA OF THE ARCHIVING CAUSES TO TO HELP PEOPLE TO MAXIMIZE THEIR IMPACT UM IN GENERAL UH OBVIOUSLY IT'S IT'S NICE OF IT FOR ANIMALS UM AND WE'D LIKE TO DISCUSS THOSE OPTIONS WITH PEOPLE BUT I DON'T THINK THAT UM
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00218	IF YOU HAVEN'T DECIDED A HUNDRED PERCENT ON ANIMAL EFFICACY I THINK THAT IT WOULD STILL BE VERY INTERESTING TO HAVE A DIALOGUE UM AND YOU CAN USE THE SAME TYPE OF RIGHT FRAMEWORK UM USUALLY
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00219	THAT FOR ASSESSING ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF OPTIONS THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE SPECIFIC TO ANIMAL ADVOCACY
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00221	THANK YOU NEXT QUESTION IS FROM JONATHAN UH HOW IS THE CARRIER CALLS EXPERIMENT GOING WHEN DO YOU EXPECT TO HAVE AN IDEA ON HOW EFFECTIVE THE COACHING IS AND WHETHER YOU WILL CONTINUE WITH IT
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00222	IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION LAUREN UM IT'S GOING REALLY IT'S GOING WELL AT THE MOMENT I UM I THINK
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00223	I ME AGAIN IT'S THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT I'M SURE AS YOU KNOW BY POSING THAT QUESTION IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO UH TO GET RESULTS BACK STRAIGHT AWAY
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00224	UM AT THE MOMENT WE'VE HAD QUITE A LOT OF POSITIVE FEEDBACK UM BUT WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE DOING IS UH ASSESSING INCREMENTAL CHANGES THAT PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE UH HAVE MADE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00225	BASED ON THE CALLS UM IT'S LIKELY THAT WE WILL GET INITIAL RESULTS UM AFTER ABOUT SIX MONTHS AFTER THE CALLS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00226	BUT LIKELY UM IF YOU LOOK AT EIGHT THOUSAND HOURS AND YOU'VE SEEN THAT WORK UM THEY HAVE ADVISED US THAT IT'LL PROBABLY BE TWO TO THREE YEARS BEFORE WE REALLY SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERSTAND
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00227	UM WHETHER WE'VE HAD ANY IMPACT OR NOT UM WHICH IS WHY IT'S ONLY ONE OF THE FEW THINGS THAT WE'RE EXPERIMENTING IN THE SITE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00229	THANK YOU
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00231	NEXT QUESTION IS FROM ANDREA UH HOW SHOULD WE FIND A JOB IN ANIMAL RIGHTS RESEARCH IF THERE AREN'T AREN'T SO MANY OPEN VACANCIES
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00233	A REALLY GOOD QUESTION UM I THINK UM AS I SAID WHEN UH WE WERE ACTUALLY DOING OUR SPOT CHECK AND RESEARCH
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00234	IT DOES SEEM THAT SOME ROLES ARE A LOT MORE COMPETITIVE THAN OTHERS AND RESEARCH IS DEFINITELY ONE OF THEM
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00235	AND CAMPAIGNING IS ANOTHER AND SO IN THAT SITUATION THERE'S JUST A LOT OF PEOPLE AND THERE'S THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ROLES
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00236	UM WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST UH WOULD BE TO WORK ON THE GENERATING OPTIONS UM IDEA BECAUSE IT COULD BE THAT IF ONE TERM YOU WANT TO DO RESEARCH
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00237	AND THAT COULD THAT DEFINITELY SELL A PLAUSIBLE PATH BUT IT MIGHT JUST BE THAT AT THE MOMENT INITIALLY THERE AREN'T THE RESEARCH ROLES AVAILABLE UM SO I WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK INTO OTHER OPTIONS THAT YOU HAVE MORE IMMEDIATELY
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00238	UM IF YOUR LONG TERM IS IS THINKING ABOUT HAVING A CAREER IN RESEARCH TO LOOK FOR MORE IMMEDIATE OPTIONS THAT CAN HELP YOU GET TOWARDS THAT GOAL
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00239	UM AT THE END UM AND NOT TO FOCUS TOO MUCH ON NOT GETTING SPECIFIC OPPORTUNITIES RIGHT NOW
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00241	AND WE HAVE TIME FOR ONE LAST QUESTION AND WE HAVE ONLY ONE LAST QUESTION IN SLIDO SO THIS IS A FORTUNATE UH THE LAST QUESTION IS WHAT DO ENVISION ANIMAL ADVOCACY CAREERS ARE DOING IN FIVE YEARS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00243	THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION THAT'S A REALLY REALLY GOOD QUESTION UM AT LEAST THE EASY ANSWER TO THAT WOULD BE DOING THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT WE CAN TO HELP INDIVIDUALS MAXIMIZE THEIR IMPACT FOR ANIMALS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00244	UM THE THE THE SLIGHTLY HARDER QUESTION UH UH ANSWER WOULD BE THAT I REALLY DON'T KNOW THAT'S WHY WE'RE WE'RE TESTING DIFFERENT THINGS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00245	UM AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND EXPERIMENTING ON A SMALL SCALE UM SO WE CAN TRY AND WORK OUT HOW WE'RE HELPING HOW WE CAN HELP UM INDIVIDUALS
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00246	UM SO AS MUCH FEEDBACK WOULD BE UM GRATEFULLY ACCEPTED WHETHER IT'S POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE IT HELPS US TO UM TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN OUR WORK
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00248	OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH LAUREN WE ARE OUT OF QUESTIONS OUT OF TIME I THINK FOR THE REST OF US IT'S TIME TO UNMUTE OURSELVES AND GIVE LAUREN A SHORT RANG ROUND OF APPLAUSE
YTB+ZsWHsPGqzhI+00250	OH THANK YOU LAUREN FOR THE INTERACTION
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00002	WELCOME TO THE CATERING MEDICAL CONFERENCE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FROM ME I'M YOUNG HARTWEIG THE CEO OF CATERING MEDICAL AND I'M VERY HAPPY THAT SO MUCH PARTICIPANTS JOINED HERE TODAY
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00003	AND I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ALL THE PARTICIPANTS PARTICIPANTS AND SPEAKERS THAT HAVE JOINED
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00004	SO WE'RE NOW LOOKING FORWARD TO A VERY EXCITING AFTERNOON WITH GREAT PRESENTATIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL MODELING IN IN MEDICINE AND MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY AND INCILICO METHODS IN HEALTH IN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY PLEASE ENJOY
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00006	FOR THE OPENING OF THE CADFEM MEDICAL CONFERENCE TWENTY TWENTY ONE I WILL INVITE YOU TO A SHORT LOOK ON WHAT WE DO AND ACHIEVE WITH OUR PARTNERS AT CADFEM MEDICAL
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00007	SO AT CADFEM MEDICAL OUR VISION IS TO BE THE NUMBER ONE ENABLER FOR IN SILICO MEDICINE WE WANT TO PROVIDE PHYSICIANS AND PATIENTS ACCESS TO IN SILICO METHODS
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00008	SO WITH OUR MISSION TO TRANSFER SIMULATION TECHNOLOGIES FROM OUTER MOTIVE AND ERROR SPACE TO HEALTHCARE WE WANT TO ENHANCE THE WELL BEING OF PATIENTS
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00009	SO TO DO SO WE DEEPLY BELIEVE IN THE USE OF NUMERICAL SIMULATION TO DETECT DISEASES IMPROVE THERAPIES AND ENHANCE THE PRODUCT SAFETY OF MEDICAL DEVICES
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00010	ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS UM HAS THE ROOTS IN RESEARCH PROJECTS AND WITH ACADEMIA AND UNIVERSITIES
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00011	SO FOR EXAMPLE DOC Q RPE FOR THE SURGICAL PLANNING OF FIRST MAXILLARY EXPANSIONS DEVELOPED TOGETHER WITH CLINICUM DORT MARTIN AND THE UNIVERSITY OF WITTENHEIM
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00012	AND ALSO DOCQ ALSO FOR THE DIAGNOSIS AND THERAPY OF OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA IT'S ALSO AN UNIVERSAL UM AND GRANT FUNDED UH RESEARCH PROJECT
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00013	AND DOCUMENTARY FOR THE DIGITAL VERIFICATION OF CUSTOM IMPLANTS ALSO SO ALL OUR PRODUCTS ARE BASED ON ON RESEARCH AND UNIVERSAL RESEARCH TO TEST AND TO REALLY VERIFY OUR MODELS AND OUR IDEAS
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00015	AND TO BRING THESE INNOVATIONS FROM ACADEMIA AND RESEARCH TO INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS WE DEVELOP DOC SO OUR SCALABLE AND SILICON PLATFORM ENABLE DOCTORS AND METRIC USE AND SIMULATION TECHNOLOGIES IN PREDEFINED MEDICAL WORKFLOWS
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00016	SO EVERY SPECIFIC MEDICAL QUESTION IS ALWAYS TRANSFERRED INTO A SO CALLED DOCUMENT MODULE SO THE BLUE CUBE YOU CAN SEE IN THE MIDDLE
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00017	AND EACH MODULE IS A PRODUCT WITH A SPECIFIC INTENDED USE WHICH THEN CAN OPERATE AUTONOMOUS TOGETHER WITH THE PLATFORM DOCTOR CORE IN GREEN
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00018	SO THROUGH OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH MICROSOFT WE ARE DELIVERING A VERY SCALABLE INFRASTRUCTURE ENABLING UNRESTRICTED AND EASY TO USE ACCESS TO OUR PRODUCTS AND AND THE SOLVERS IN VERIFIED INFRASTRUCTURES ON AZURE
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00019	AND TO GIVE A BETTER IDEA OF HOW WE USE AMERICAN SIMULATION TO ADD VALUE I WILL SHOW YOU SOME EXAMPLES AND BENEFITS OF THE MODULES BASED ON OUR DOC Q PLATFORM
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00021	FIRST OF ALL TOKYO OSA TO SUPPORT THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA AND SLEEP RELATED BREATHING DISORDERS
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00022	SO IT SUPPORTS THE DIAGNOSIS AND THERAPY WITH COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS AND FLUID STRUCTURE INTERACTION
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00023	WITH DOCQ ALSO IT IS POSSIBLE FOR A PHYSICIAN TO VISUALIZE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF AN UPPER AIRWAY AND DETERMINE THE ANATOMICAL AND BIOMECHANICAL CAUSES AND THE AREA OF THE RESPIRATORY PROBLEM FOR A PATIENT
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00024	REALLY OBJECTIFYING THE ROOT CAUSES AND IMPROVE THE COMMUNICATION OF THE TREATMENT OPTIONS TO THE PATIENT
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00025	AND CURRENTLY WE ARE IN A PATIENT STUDY WITH OVER SIXTY PATIENTS TOGETHER WITH A CLINICAL PART AND CLINICAL ENDORSEMENT AND WE'RE AIMING FOR A C MARK IN EARLY TWENTY TWENTY THREE
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00027	THE NEXT EXAMPLE IS DOC Q RPE IT'S A SOFTWORK FOR SURGICAL PLANNING OF SO CALLED FORCE MULTIPLIER DISTRACTIONS SO IT CALCULATES THE OPTIMAL CUTTING PATTERNS AND
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00028	SYMMETRICAL FACE AFTER AND DURING THE FORCED WIDENING OF THE UPPER JAW SO THE PROBLEM WITH THIS PROCEDURE IS VERY SIMPLE SO NEARLY EVERYONE HAS A SYMMETRICAL OR ASYMMETRICAL ANATOMY
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00029	SO MEANING DIFFERENT BONE THICKNESSES IN THE SKULL FOR THE FORCED OPENING OF THE UPPER JAW THE SO CALLED DISTRACTOR IS POSITIONED IN THE UPPER JAW AND APPLIES A SYMMETRICAL FORCE ONTO THE BONE PARTS
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00030	AND SYMMETRIC BONE WEAKENING CUTS WILL BE INTRODUCED IN MAXILLA NORMALLY AND LEFT AND RIGHT WITH THE SAME LENGTH SO THIS CAN RESULT IN AN ASYMMETRIC OPENING OF THE MAXILLA MEANING ONE SIDE OF THE UPPER JAW MOVES MORE THAN THE OPPOSITE SIDE
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00031	SO WITH DOC Q RPE KLS MARTIN CAN CALCULATE THE OPTIMAL CUTTING PATTERNS AND GENERATE THE CUTTING GUIDE FOR THE SURGERY SO THEY CAN RELY ON CONSISTENT QUALITY OF PATIENT CARE AND THE BEST SURGICAL OUTCOMES
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00033	AND AND THE REALLY NICE THING ON TOP OF THE REDUCTION OF THE TRAUMA FOR THE PATIENT THROUGH SHORTER CUTS AND REMAINING BLOOD VESSELS THE SEMATRIC OUTCOME AND THE BETTER AESTHETICS FOR THE PATIENT
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00034	IS THERE IS A POSSIBILITY TO INDIVIDUALIZE AN OFF THE SHELF MEDICAL DEVICE
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00035	SO KLS MARTIN CAN GIVE AN ADDED VALUE BY SELLING AN HYBRID PRODUCT A STANDARDIZED HARDWARE PRODUCT PLUS A PERSONALIZED DIGITAL PLANNING WITH SIMULATION
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00037	AND WITH THE THIRD EXAMPLE COMING FROM ACADEMIA
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00038	DOC Q V I WHERE T STANDS FOR VIRTUAL IMPLANT TESTING WE WANT TO HELP AND MAKE MEDICAL DEVICES SAFER
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00039	SO WE SAW A BIG TREND IN PERSONALIZED PERSONALIZATION OF MEDICAL DEVICES AND IF MEDICAL DEVICES ARE PERSONALIZED THEY ARE UNIQUE AND PRODUCED JUST ONCE SO THAT MEANS THEY CANNOT BE TESTED LIKE STANDARD MEDICAL DEVICES
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00040	SO IN THE PRODUCTION PROCESS OF THESE CUSTOM IMPLANTS
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00041	USUALLY THEY ACQUIRE PATIENT DATA DO A SURGICAL PLANNING TOGETHER WITH A DOCTOR VIA WEB MEETING UM TO AN IMPLEMENT DESIGN BY A DESIGNER OR IN A POC SO POINT OF CARE CENTER AND A CLINIC
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00042	AND THEN DO THE IMPLANT MANUFACTURING WITH MILLING THREE D PRINTING ETC AND POST PROCESSING STEPS
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00043	AND SENDING IT TO SURGERY NORMALLY THAT HAPPENS WITHIN A TWO TO EIGHT DAYS UM FROM DATA ACQUISITION TO TO SENDING THE RESULTS
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00044	AND THERE'S ALREADY A LOT OF QUALITY MANAGEMENT NECESSARY IN THE MANUFACTURING AND THE POST PROCESSING AND A LOT OF QUALITY MANAGEMENT THAT HAS TO GET INTO TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00045	BUT WHERE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND WHERE THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF A DEVICE FOR A PATIENT IS DETERMINED IT'S IN THE SURGICAL PLANNING AND IMPLANT DESIGN BUT THERE'S NO POSSIBILITY UM TO TEST YOUR DEVICES FOR EACH PATIENT
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00046	AND THERE DOCUMENTATION COMES IN SO WE DEVELOPED TO FILL THE SHAPE DOCUMENTATION AND DIGITAL DESIGN VERIFICATION AND AN AUTOMATED REPORTING OF THE RESULTS FOR THE TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00048	SO IN A NUTSHELL DOC Q V A T IS AN EASY TO USE SOFTWARE FOR DIGITAL VERIFICATION OF CUSTOM IMPLANTS
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00049	AND WE CAN APPLY PHYSIOLOGICAL AND STANDARDIZED LOADS TO PATIENT SPECIFIC SITUATION AND SPECIFIC BASIC PATIENT SPECIFIC IMPLANTS AND REDUCE THE LIABILITY BASED ON OBJECTIVE CRITERIA
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00050	AND ENSURE THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY WITH HIGHLY COMPLEX BY A MECHANICAL SIMULATIONS SO AT THE MOMENT WORKFLOWS ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE MACHINE THE MANUAL THE THORAX AND SOON FOR THE LOWER ARMS
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00052	AND WHAT THAT MAY MAY HAPPEN IS REALLY RESEARCH AND AND A LOT OF EFFORT AND IN OUR PLATFORM
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00053	AND TO SUM IT UP WITH OUR PLATFORM DOCUMENT WE WANT TO REALLY PROVIDE AN ECOSYSTEM FOR INSILICO TECHNOLOGIES AND FOR ACADEMIA AND OTHER COMPANIES SO WE DO NOT
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00055	OR WE WANT THE COMPANIES AND AN ACADEMIC DO NOT REINVENT THE WHEEL
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00056	BECAUSE DOCUSE PROVIDING ARE ALREADY A SCALABILITY A WORKING INFRASTRUCTURE UM THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THE BASE TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS ANSYS SOLVERS FOR RENDERING DICOM AND DATA HANDLING USER MANAGEMENT ETC ETC
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00057	AND WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE GREAT IDEAS AND SOLUTIONS BEING DEVELOPED IN RESEARCH AND INDUSTRY AND TOGETHER WE CAN FURTHER DEVELOP THEM AND MAKE THEM AVAILABLE FOR PATIENTS AND DOCTORS
YTB+ccISAlE32Ic+00059	SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION UM AND A BIG THANK YOU TO OUR PARTNERS SPEAKERS AND PANELISTS TODAY AND FEEL FREE TO CONTACT US AND PLEASE ENJOY THE AFTERNOON THANK YOU VERY MUCH
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00001	I WELCOME YOU TO THIS PRESENTATION ENTITLED CITIZEN ATTITUDES TOWARDS GENOME EDITING IN FARM ANIMALS
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00003	WE ASKED AROUND THREE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED CITIZENS FROM AUSTRIA CANADA GERMANY ITALY AND THE US ON THIS TOPIC AND WE COLLECTED OUR DATA ONLINE BETWEEN MAY AND NOVEMBER
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00004	OUR FIRST RESEARCH QUESTION IS ARE DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS OF GENOME EDITING RIGHT OR WRONG TO DO FROM A CITIZEN'S PERSPECTIVE
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00005	WE INCLUDED FIVE DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS OF GENOME EDITING IN THE STUDY THREE OF THEM REFERRED TO DISEASE RESISTANCE WITHIN DIFFERENT SPECIES
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00006	NAMELY HIV RESISTANCE IN HUMANS MILDEW RESISTANCE IN WHEAT PLANTS AND RESISTANCE TO PESTS IN PIGS
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00007	THE OTHER TWO APPLICATIONS REFERRED TO EDITING CATTLE DO PRODUCE ALLERGEN FREE MILK AND TO INCREASE MUSCLE GROWTH IN CATTLE
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00009	EACH STUDY PARTICIPANT WAS RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO ONE OF THE FIVE APPLICATIONS AND READ A SHORT INTRODUCTORY TEXT ABOUT GENOME EDITING AND THE SPECIFIC APPLICATION
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00011	THIS FIGURE SHOWS HOW PARTICIPANTS RESPONDED TO THE QUESTION WHETHER THEY THINK IT IS RIGHT OR WRONG TO USE GENOME EDITING FOR THE APPLICATION THEY JUST READ ABOUT
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00012	ANSWERS COULD BE GIVEN ON A SEVEN POINT LIKE THAT SCALE RANGING FROM ONE ABSOLUTELY WRONG TO DO UP TO SEVEN ABSOLUTELY RIGHT TO DO
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00014	THE APPLICATION BEING THE MOST RIGHT TO DO IS THE HIV RESISTANCE IN HUMANS FOLLOWED BY MILDEW RESISTANCE IN WHEAT PLANTS
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00015	THE THREE APPLICATIONS DEALING WITH EDITING FARM ANIMALS ARE PERCEIVED AS BEING LESS RIGHT IN THE ORDER OF RESISTANCE IN PIGS TOWARDS PURSE EDITING CATTLE TO PRODUCE ALLERGEN FREE MILK
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00016	AND THE INCREASED MUSCLE GROWTH IN CATTLE IS PERCEIVED AS WRONG ON AVERAGE
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00017	THE ORDER OF APPLICATIONS IS THE SAME IN ALL COUNTRIES WHEREAS WE OBSERVE THE GERMAN AND AUSTRIAN PARTICIPANTS BEING A BIT MORE SKEPTICAL COMPARED TO THE OTHER COUNTRIES
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00019	OUR SECOND RESEARCH QUESTION WAS WHETHER WE CAN FIND DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PARTICIPANTS ACCORDING TO THEIR ATTITUDES TOWARDS GENOME EDITING
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00021	INDEED WE WERE ABLE TO FIND FOUR DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PARTICIPANTS THE STRONG SUPPORTERS HERE IN DARK GREEN THINK THAT GENOM EDITING IS RIGHT TO DO THEY PERCEIVE LITTLE RISKS
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00022	HIGH BENEFITS AND DO NOT THINK THAT THE TECHNOLOGY IS TAMPERING WITH NATURE THE OPPONENTS IN RED THINK THAT YOU KNOW ANYTHING IS REALLY WRONG TO DO THEY PERCEIVE HIGH RISKS
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00023	LOW BENEFITS AND THING THAT IT'S TAMPERING WITH NATURE THE OTHER TWO CLUSTERS ARE IN BETWEEN THESE TWO GROUPS
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00025	THE RESULTS OF THE CLUSTER ANALYSIS SHOW THAT THERE ARE QUITE DIVERSE GROUPS OF PEOPLE WITH REGARD TO THEIR ATTITUDES TO GENOMIC EDITING
YTB+fV964pTs3Kk+00027	THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LISTENING AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS AND PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME FOR THIS
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00002	MY NAME IS COLEMAN STAVISH AND I'M THE CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER AT PROSHARE A SOFTWARE COMPANY IN THE FIELD OF CANCER RESEARCH AND DIAGNOSTICS
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00003	TODAY I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT HOW AWS PROSCHA AND THE JOINT PATHOLOGY CENTER HAVE JOINED FORCES TO ADVANCE THE PRACTICE OF PATHOLOGY
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00005	IN TODAY'S SESSION I'LL INTRODUCE PROSCIA AND SHARE HOW OUR CONCENTRIC PLATFORM HELPS TO ADDRESS FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGES IN THE PATHOLOGY INDUSTRY WE'LL ALSO LOOK AT THE JOINT PATHOLOGY CENTER AND ITS TRAIL BLAZING INITIATIVE IN DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00006	AND THROUGHOUT THE SESSION I'LL TOUCH ON HOW PARTNERSHIP WITH AWS MAKES ALL OF THIS POSSIBLE
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00008	PROCUREMENT MISSION IS TO PERFECT CANCER DIAGNOSIS WITH INTELLIGENT SOFTWARE THAT CHANGES THE WAY THE WORLD PRACTICES PATHOLOGY
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00010	WE BUILT A SOFTWARE PLATFORM THAT SUPPORTS PATHOLOGY'S TRANSITION FROM ANALOG TO DIGITAL WHICH CAN ACCELERATE DISCOVERY IN LIFE SCIENCES RESEARCH AND IMPROVE CLINICAL OUTCOMES
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00012	PROCIA WAS FOUNDED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND IS BACKED BY A STRONG GROUP OF VENTURE CAPITAL AND STRATEGIC INVESTORS TODAY PROCIA PLATFORM IS TRUSTED BY LEADING BIOMARINE COMPANIES CONTRACT RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS HOSPITAL SYSTEMS AND ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTERS
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00014	LET'S TAKE A STEP BACK BRIEFLY AND LOOK AT PATHOLOGY AS A FIELD
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00016	THIS IS AN IMAGE OF A PATHOLOGIST DESK
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00018	HUNDREDS OF GLASS SLIDES IN TRAYS AWAITING REVIEW UNDER A MICROSCOPE AND ANTIQUATED TECHNOLOGY THIS FIELD OF MEDICINE HASN'T FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED IN OVER A CENTURY AND IS IN DIRE NEED OF A TRANSFORMATION
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00020	FURTHER THE PRACTICE OF PATHOLOGY IS INHERENTLY SUBJECTIVE
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00022	PATHOLOGIST'S CONCORDANCE CAN BE AS LOW AS FIFTY FOUR PERCENT WHICH MEANS IN SOME SENSITIVE AREAS OF DIAGNOSIS AND PROGNOSIS TWO PATHOLOGISTS MAY DISAGREE WITH EACH OTHER ABOUT HALF THE TIME
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00023	WHAT THAT MEANS PRACTICALLY IS THAT A PATIENT COULD BE UNDER TREATED OR OVER TREATED BASED ON THAT DIAGNOSIS LEADING TO POTENTIALLY POOR OUTCOMES FOR THE PATIENT AND INCREASED COST OF HEALTH CARE SYSTEM
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00024	AT THE SAME TIME PATHOLOGISTS AND LABS THEY WORK FOR ARE UNDER INTENSE ECONOMIC PRESSURE GLOBALLY LABS DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH STAFF TO MEET INCREASING DEMAND WITH A GLOBAL PATHOLOGIST WORKFORCE SHRINKING
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00025	AND THE PATHOLOGIST WORKLOAD EXPLODING OVER THE PAST DECADE AS A QUICK CHECKPOINT IT'S SOMETIMES USEFUL TO COMPARE PATHOLOGY TO RADIOLOGY WHICH UNDERWENT ITS OWN DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION TWO DECADES AGO OR SO
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00026	WHILE THERE ARE SOME PARALLELS BETWEEN THE TWO SPECIALTIES PATHOLOGY IMAGES ARE ON AVERAGE TEN TIMES LARGER AVERAGING TWO GIGABYTES PER IMAGE SOMETIMES AS LARGE AS THIRTY GIGABYTES OR MORE
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00027	OF COURSE THIS PRESENTS A CONSIDERABLE CHALLENGE FROM AN IT STANDPOINT ENSURING THAT STORAGE AND COMPUTE INFRASTRUCTURE CAN SCALE TO SUPPORT WHAT'S ON TRACK TO BECOME ONE OF THE MOST DATA INTENSIVE FIELDS OF MEDICINE
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00028	AWS AND ITS BROAD SOLUTION PORTFOLIO HAS BEEN AN EXCELLENT PARTNER TO PROCIA AND MANY CUSTOMERS PRACTICING DIGITAL PATHOLOGY AT SCALE
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00029	POWERING PATHOLOGY SHIFT TO DIGITAL ARE THREE TECHNOLOGY PILLARS FIRST SLIDES ARE DIGITIZED USING WHOLE SLIDE SCANNERS WHICH TAKE A GLASS SLIDE AND PRODUCE A DIGITAL IMAGE FOR PATHOLOGY REVIEW
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00030	AND THOSE IMAGES ARE MANAGED IN AN IMAGE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00032	AFTER AN IMAGE IS CREATED IT CAN BE ANALYZED BY ONE OR MORE COMPUTATIONAL APPLICATIONS OR ALGORITHMS INTENDED TO AID THE PATHOLOGIST OR SCIENTIST
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00034	PROSCIA BUILDS THE IMAGE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM CONCENTRIC AND ALSO HAS A PORTFOLIO OF AD ON APPLICATIONS
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00036	PROCURE CONCENTRIC PLATFORM LIVES AT THE CENTER OF THE PATHOLOGY ECOSYSTEM
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00038	CONCENTRIC RUNS NATIVELY ON AWS TO MANAGE ALL PATHOLOGY DATA IN THE CLOUD FOR HIGH SCALE ABILITY WHILE KEEPING COSTS UNDER CONTROL
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00040	CONCENTRIC INTEGRATES WITH THIRD PARTY SOLUTIONS TO DELIVER A BEST IN CLASS EXPERIENCE TRADITIONAL PATHOLOGY PULLING IMAGES IN FROM ANY SLIDE SCANNER AND PATIENT DATA FROM THE LABORATORY INFORMATION SYSTEM
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00042	CONCENTRIC PROVIDES PATHOLOGISTS WITH THEIR PORTAL FOR READING IMAGES AND RENDERING DIAGNOSES AND ENABLES INSTANT REMOTE CONSULTATION WITH EXPERTS AROUND THE WORLD
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00044	CONCENTRIC IS DESIGNED TO USE AWS OFFERINGS SUCH AS S THREE OBJECT STORAGE WITH INTELLIGENT DATA
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00046	AWS AND EC TWO INSTANCES WITH AUTO SCALING TO SUPPORT THE HIGH AND SOMETIMES VARIABLE DEMANDS OF DIGITAL PATHOLOGY
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00048	NOW I LIKE THE SHIFT GEARS AND INTRODUCE THE JOINT PATHOLOGY CENTER WHICH IS THE PATHOLOGY CENTER OF EXCELLENCE FOR THE UNITED STATES MILITARY AND OTHER FEDERAL
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00050	THE JPC'S MISSION IS TWOFOLD FIRST TO DELIVER THE HIGHEST QUALITY PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION AND EDUCATION
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00051	AND SECOND TO GROW AND PRESERVE THE WORLD'S LARGEST TISSUE BIOREPOSITORY REPOSITORY FOR BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH AS THE STEWARD OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST HUMAN TISSUE BANK
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00052	CONTAINING OVER FIFTY FIVE MILLION GLASS SLIDES DATING BACK OVER A CENTURY THE JPC HAS EMBARKED ON AN INCREDIBLY EXCITING DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION TO DIGITIZE ITS VAST SLIDE ARCHIVE TO PROMOTE NOVEL RESEARCH
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00054	AND INTO STREAMLINE ITS PATHOLOGY PRACTICE FOR CONSULTATION
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00056	AT PROSCIA WERE HONORED TO DELIVER OUR CONFIDENTIAL PLATFORM TO THE JPC TO SUPPORT THEIR EFFORT AND AWS GOOGLE CLOUD WAS ALSO SELECTED TO SUPPORT THIS PROJECT DUE TO ITS STRONG COMPLIANCE MEASURES SCALABILITY AND EASE OF DEPLOYMENT
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00058	AS IN A SIDE THE JOINT PATHOLOGY CENTERS GROUNDBREAKING PROJECT WAS RECENTLY FEATURED ON SIXTY MINUTES THE SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTED THE TREMENDOUS VALUE IN BEING ABLE TO SEARCH A VAST AND DIVERSE ARCHIVE OF DISEASE TO COMBAT PANDEMICS AND OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH CRISES
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00060	I ENCOURAGE ANYONE TO LOOK AT THE SEGMENT IF INTERESTED AS I'VE MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY IT INFRASTRUCTURE IS A CRUCIAL PIECE TO THE DIGITIZATION OF PATHOLOGY AWS CLOUD PROVIDES CUSTOMERS AN EFFICIENT SOLUTION RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00061	FIRST OFFERING SECURITY FOR SENSITIVE HEALTH CARE AND BIO PHARMA INFORMATION REGULATORY COMPLIANCE SCALABLE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR FAST GROWING AND HIGH VOLUME DATA SETS
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00062	ENABLING COLLABORATION FOR MORE EFFICIENT REMOTE WORK WHICH IS OF OF COURSE BECOMING INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT OVER THE PAST YEAR AND FINALLY COST EFFECTIVENESS MAKING ADOPTION EASIER INITIALLY AND ENABLING FUTURE EXPANSION
YTB+naaVGV_zx7c+00064	IN SUMMARY BEST IN CLASS SOFTWARE COUPLED WITH FLEXIBLE SCALABLE AND SECURE IT INFRASTRUCTURE ARE REQUIRED TO BUILD THE FUTURE PATHOLOGY PROSHARE AND AWS ARE PROUD TO PARTNER TO DELIVER SOLUTIONS THAT HELP OUR CUSTOMERS REALIZE THIS VISION

YTB+npZWztwSMAk+00078	CERTAINLY STRENGTHENS AND UNFOLDS OUR ONE INNER URGE TO BECOME YA MORE COMPASSIONATE DOCTOR OR EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY YA MORE COMPASSIONATE HUMAN BEING
YTB+npZWztwSMAk+00079	LOVE SERVE THANK YOU
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00001	EXCERTAIN THAT THE PATIENT IS THE RIGHT CANDIDATE FOR THE PROCEDURE THEN THE NEXT STEP IS THE RADIOLOGICAL PLANNING WHICH WILL BE DISCUSSED IN THIS VIDEO ONE SHOULD KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH IS THE VERSA OR VALGUS DEFORMITY WHETHER THE DEFORMITY IS IN THE TIBIA OR FEMUR OR BOTH
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00002	HOW MUCH CORRECTION SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN ARE YOU GOING TO CORRECT IN THE TIBIA OR FEMUR OR IN BOTH THE STEPS IN RADIOLOGICAL PLANNING FOR HIGH TIBIA AOSTEOGENY ARE OBTAINING PROPER X RAYS AND ANALYZING THEM RADIOLOGICAL PLANNING
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00003	INTRAPERATIVE VERIFICATION AND FINALLY OBTAINING A GOOD RESULT A STANDING FULL LENGTH X RAY WITH THE PATIENT BEARING WEIGHT ON BOTH THE LIMBS IS VERY CRUCIAL FOR PLANNING FOR AUDIOLOGY
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00004	THE X RAY SOURCE IS POSITIONED TEN FEET AWAY FROM THE PATIENT AND A LONG CASSETTE CAN BE USED OR A CASSETTE DECK IS SHOWN IN THE IMAGE WITH AN IMAGE PROCESSING SOFTWARE CAN ALSO BE USED
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00005	THE X RAY BEAM IS CENTERED ON THE KNEE AND THE EXPOSURE WOULD BE AROUND EIGHTY FIVE TO ONE HUNDRED FIVE KILOVOLTS THE X RAY IMAGE WILL ALWAYS BE DOWNSIZED AND TO KNOW THE ORIGINAL MEASUREMENTS PLACEMENT OF AN OBJECT WITH A KNOWN SIZE IS IMPORTANT
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00006	A METALLIC SPHERE IS PREFERABLE AS IT CASTS A ROUND SHADOW ALWAYS HERE A METALLIC BALL OF THREE CENTIMETERS WHICH IS EMBEDDED IN A CLOTH VELCRO BELT IS TIED AROUND THE LOWER THIRD OF THIGH IN LEVEL WITH THE BONE IN THE SAGITAL SECTION
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00007	THE PATIENT'S PATELLA SHOULD BE FACING FORWARD AND THE INNERVATOR SUPERIOR ILIAC SPINE SHOULD BE AT THE SAME LEVEL ANY LIMB LENGTH DISCREPANCY NOTED SHOULD BE ADDRESSED BY KEEPING PLANKS UNDER THE SHORTER LEG
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00008	A PROPERLY EXPOSED SCANNING GRAM SHOULD BE EXAMINED FOR THE CENTRAL POSITION OF PATELLA THE LATERAL TIBIAL MARGIN SHOULD CROSS THE FIBULA AT THE WIDEST PART OF FIBULA THERE SHOULD BE A ONE THIRD OVERLAP OF FIBULA BY TIBIA
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00009	THE DISTAL FEMUR AND JOINT LINE SHOULD BE CLEARLY VISIBLE WITHOUT ANY OVERLAP IN PLANNING WE ARE CONCERNED PRIMARILY WITH MECHANICAL AXIS ANATOMICAL AXIS OF A LONG BONE IS A LINE THAT DIVIDES THE SHAFT INTO TWO HALVES
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00010	THE MECHANICAL AXIS OF THE FEMUR CONNECTS THE CENTER OF THE PHENOMENAL HEAD AND THE CENTER OF THE INTERCONDYLAR NOTCH IN THE TIBIA IS A LINE CONNECTING THE CENTER OF THE TIBIAL ARTICULAR SURFACE WITH THE CENTER OF THE ANKLE JOINT
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00011	IN FEMORAL THE ANATOMICAL AND MECHANICAL AXES ARE DIFFERENT WITH A SIX TO SEVEN DEGREES VARIATION IN TIBIA BOTH ARE ALMOST SAME WITH THE ANATOMICAL AXIS BEING THREE TO FOUR MILLIMETERS MEDIAL TO THE MECHANICAL AXIS
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00012	THE MECHANICAL AXIS OF THE ENTIRE LOWER LIMB ALSO CALLED THE MCCULLOCH'S LINE RUNS FROM THE CENTER OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL HEAD TO THE CENTER OF THE ANKLE JOINT UNDER PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS THIS LINE RUNS ON AN AVERAGE OF FOUR MILLIMETERS MEDIAL TO THE CENTER OF THE KNEE JOINT
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00013	WHEN THIS LINE IS DISPLACED MORE THAN TEN MILLIMETERS LATERALLY OR MORE THAN FIFTEEN MILLIMETERS MEDIALLY THEN IT IS CALLED A SIGNIFICANT MECHANICAL AXIS DEVIATION
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00014	IN THIS VIDEO WE WILL CONSIDER THE VERTEX DEFORMITY PRIMARILY VERTEX DEFORMITY COULD BE PRODUCED BY DEFORMITIES IN TIBIA OR FEMUR EROSION OF MEDIAL JOINT LAXITY OF LATERAL LIGAMENT STRUCTURES AND FOLLOWING MALL UNITED AND TRIARTICULAR FRACTURES
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00015	THE MECHANICAL AXIS DEVIATION WOULD INDICATE A SIGNIFICANT VERTEBRA BUT TO UNDERSTAND THE ORIGIN OF THE VERTEBRA
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00016	IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW AND CALCULATE THESE TWO MEASUREMENTS MEDIAL PROXIMAL TIBIAL ANGLE SHORTENED AS MPTA AND LATERAL DISTAL FEMORAL ANGLE SHORTENED AS LDFA
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00017	THE MPTA IS THE ANGLE FORMED BY THE MECHANICAL AXIS OF THE TIBIA WITH THE TANGENTIAL LINE TO THE TIBIAL ARTICULAR SURFACE ITS NORMAL VALUE IS EIGHTY SEVEN DEGREES WITH A DEVIATION OF THREE DEGREES
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00018	ANY DECREASE IN THE VALUE INDICATES THAT THE ORIGIN OF VERUS IS FROM THE TIBIA
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00019	IS THE ANGLE FORMED BY THE MECHANICAL AXIS OF THE FEMUR WITH THE TANGENTIAL LINE TO THE DISTAL PHYSIOLOGICAL ARTICULAR SURFACE AND ONCE AGAIN IT HAS THE SAME VALUE OF EIGHTY SEVEN DEGREES ANY INCREASE IN THIS VALUE INDICATES THAT THE ORIGIN OF VERTEBRA IS FROM THE FEMUR
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00020	ONCE THE TIBIA IS CONFIRMED AS THE SOURCE OF VERUS THE CAUSE OF THE VERUS SHOULD BE ASCERTAINED IT COULD BE A MEDIAL JOINT EROSION IT COULD BE A METAPHYSICAL DEFORMITY
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00021	LOSE LATERAL STRUCTURES DUE TO A PREVIOUS LIGAMENT INJURY OR STRETCHING CAN CAUSE LATERAL JOINT OPENING AGGRAVATING THE VERSA VERY RARELY THE VERSA CAN BE CONTRIBUTED BY A DIAPHYSEAL DEFORMITY
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00022	IN MANY CASES THE METAPHYSICAL VARUS CAN BE MEASURED BY CALCULATING THE TIBIAL BONE VARUS ANGLE
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00023	IT IS THE ANGLE FORMED BETWEEN THE EPIPHYSIAL AXIS THE LINE THAT IS PERPENDICULAR TO THE LINE THAT CONNECTS THE MEDIAL AND LATERAL ENDS OF THE EPIPHYSIAL SCAR LINE AND THE MECHANICAL AXIS OF TIBIA A TBA MORE THAN FIVE DEGREES INDICATES A METAPHYSICAL VARUS
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00024	HTO GIVES THE BEST RESULTS IF DONE FOR A METAPHYSICAL DEFORMITY AS IT CORRECTS THE DEFORMITY AND RESTORES NORMAL MORPHOLOGY IT GIVES THE BEST OUTCOMES
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00025	ON THE OTHER HAND AN HTO IN A NORMAL PROXIMAL TIBIAL MORPHOLOGY CAN INDUCE A NEW DEFORMITY EVEN THOUGH UNLOADING IS ACHIEVED IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE VARS PRODUCED BY LATERAL JOINT OPENING DUE TO EXCESS LAXITY OF THE LATERAL LIGAMENT STRUCTURES
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00026	ONE SHOULD NOT CORRECT THIS COMPONENT OF VERSA AND BONE THE JOINT LINE CONVERGENCE ANGLE IS THE ANGLE BETWEEN THE TANGENTS TO THE DISTAL PHYSIAL AND DISTAL TIBIAL ARTICULAR SURFACES UP TO TWO DEGREES IS NORMAL
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00027	ANY VALUE MORE THAN THAT SHOULD BE SUBTRACTED FROM THE OVERALL VERSE CORRECTION FUJISAWA POINT IS A POPULAR LANDMARK FOR SHIFTING THE WEIGHT BEARING LINE WHICH WAS INFERRED FROM A RETROSPECTIVE SERIES
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00028	IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO SHIFT THE WEIGHT BEARING LINE TO FUJISAWA POINT IN ALL CASES
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00029	MOSTLY WE AIM TO ACHIEVE A TWO OR THREE DEGREE OF VALGUS TO ACHIEVE THAT THE WEIGHT BEARING LINE IS SHIFTED JUST LATERAL TO THE LATERAL TIBIAL SPINE
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00031	BUT DEPENDING ON THE PREVAILING OSTEO ARTHRITIC CHANGES THE WEIGHT BEARING LINE CAN BE SHIFTED FURTHER LATERALLY TO UNLOAD THE MEDIAL COMPARTMENT MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00032	WE KNOW THE DIFFERENCE ANGLES AND DEGREES BUT WE NEED TO KNOW THE SIZE OF OPENING WEDGE IN MILLIMETERS TO COMPLETE THE OSTEOGENY WE HAVE FEW METHODS WHICH WILL HELP US DERIVE THE EXACT HEIGHT OF THE OSTEOGENY WEDGE IN MILLIMETERS
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00033	THE MINIAC METHOD IS THE ONE WHICH IS POPULARLY USED IN A WEIGHT BEARING X RAY THE EXISTING WEIGHT BEARING LINE IS DRAWN THE CORRECTION POINT IS CHOSEN ACCORDING TO THE EXISTING OSTEO ARTHRITIC CHANGES
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00034	AND THE HINGE POINT IS ALSO MARKED ON THE LATERAL TIBIAL CORTEX THE NEW WEIGHT BEARING LINE IS DRAWN THROUGH THE CORRECTION POINT THE NEW WEIGHT BEARING LINE SHOULD BE OF THE SAME LENGTH AS THE OLD WEIGHT BEARING LINE
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00035	THE DISTAL END OF THE NEW LINE IS CONNECTED TO THE HINGE POINT AND THEN ONTO THE CENTER OF THE ANGLE JOINT THE ANGLE MADE AT THE HINGE POINT IS NOTED AT THIS STAGE IF THERE IS A SOFT TISSUE VARUS ANY JLCA MORE THAN TWO DEGREES SHOULD BE SUBTRACTED FROM THIS ANGLE MEASUREMENT
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00036	A TRIANGLE WITH THE HINGE POINT IS THE APEX WITH THE RESULTANT ANGLE IS DRAWN THE BASE OF THE TRIANGLE GIVES THE MEASUREMENT FOR THE OPENING WEDGE SINCE THE X RAYS ARE DOWNSIZED IT IS IMPORTANT TO CALIBRATE AT THIS STAGE
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00037	NOW THE METALLIC SPHERE IS MEASURED AND THE CALIBRATION RATIO IS FOUND OUT AND IS APPLIED TO THE MEASUREMENT WHICH GIVES THE REAL LIFE OPENING DISTANCE IN MILLIMETERS ONE CAN ALSO USE VARIOUS SOFTWARES FOR RADIOLOGICAL PLANNING
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00038	BUT ONE SHOULD BE AWARE OF PLOTTING MISTAKES INTER OBSERVER AND INTER OBSERVER VARIATIONS
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00039	ANOTHER PITFALL ONE SHOULD BE AWARE IS THE INTRA ARTICULAR DEFORMITY OF TIBIA AS FOLLOWING A MALUNITED MEDIAL TIBIAL FRACTURE OR A BLUNT'S DISEASE RESULTING IN A PAGODA TIBIA HERE THE JOINT SURFACES ARE INCONGRUENT AND THE PATIENT WALKS WITH SEVERE VERUS THRUST
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00040	HERE AN INTRAARTICULAR OSTEOTOMY TO LIFT ONLY THE MEDIAL TIBIAL CONDILE IS APPROPRIATE DOING HTO IN THIS SITUATION CAN RESULT IN A TETER EFFECT WITH A POOR RESULT
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00042	ANOTHER PITFALL WOULD BE TO MISS THE VARIED DEFORMITY DUE TO SOFT TISSUE LAXITY THIS WOULD TYPICALLY RESULT IN AN OVER CORRECTION AS THE SOFT TISSUE LAXITY COLLAPSES ONCE THE KNEE GOES FOR VAGUS
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00043	IN MAJOR CORRECTIONS OVER TWELVE MILLIMETERS THE RESULTANT NPTA ANGLES SHOULD BE CALCULATED AN NPTA OF NINETY FOUR DEGREES WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE IN A CORRECTION
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00044	ANYTHING MORE WOULD RESULT IN JOINT SHARE AND CAN RESULT IN POOR LONG TERM OUTCOMES DISTRIBUTING THE CORRECTION ACROSS BOTH FEMALE AND TIBIA IN A DOUBLE LEVEL OSTEOLOGY WOULD PREVENT JOINT
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00045	THE TIBIA NORMALLY SLOPES DOWN POSTERIORLY BY SEVEN TO NINE DEGREES IDEALLY ONE SHOULD NOT CHANGE THE TIBIAL SLOPE DURING AN
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00046	HOWEVER ONE MUST REMEMBER THAT THE OPENING WEDGE OSTEOGENY HAS A TENDENCY TO INCREASE THE SLOPE AND A CLOSING WEDGE OSTEOGENY HAS A TENDENCY TO DECREASE THE SLOPE
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00047	IN AN ACL DEFICIENCY KNEE THE SLOPE SHOULD NOT BE INCREASED AND IN A PCL DEFICIENCY THE SLOPE SHOULD NOT BE DECREASED NOT ONLY PATIENT SELECTION BUT CAREFUL RADIOLOGICAL PLANNING IS CRUCIAL FOR THE SUCCESS OF HIGH TIBIAL OSTEOTOMY
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00048	ONE SHOULD ALWAYS RESIST A TENDENCY TO IBALL OR DEPEND ON INTEROPERATIVE CHECKS LIKE DIATHERMYCABLE OR LONG RODS PARALAX IN POSITIONING ERRORS CAN LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT MISTAKES ALWAYS RELY ON YOUR PREOPERATIVE PLANNING VALUES
YTB+tt9pmMkBnwY+00049	HTO IS A PROCEDURE OF PERFECTIONS IT STARTS FROM TAKING PERFECT X RAYS TO CAREFUL EXECUTION THANKS FOR YOUR ATTENTION
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00001	HELLO ALL MY NAME IS KEVIN I'M A RHEUMATOLOGIST HERE AT THE DIVISION OF RHEUMATOLOGY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00002	MY TALK TODAY IS GOING TO BE AN UPDATE OF A TALK I GAVE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN I'VE CHANGED THE TITLE TO NOW BE UPDATES IN THE PREVENTION OF RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00004	WE HAVE SOME DISCLOSURES AROUND GRANT FUNDING AND CONSULTING FROM INDUSTRY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00006	AND THEN I THINK THESE SLIDES ARE AVAILABLE FOR EVERYBODY BUT HERE'S A COUPLE OF EVIDENCE BASED REVIEWS THAT TALK IN MUCH MORE DETAIL ABOUT WHAT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT TODAY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00008	SO THE DISEASE THAT I'M FOCUSING ON HERE IS RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS IT'S AN IMMUNE DISEASE THAT PRIMARILY AFFECTS THE JOINTS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00010	CERTAINLY CAN AFFECT OTHER THINGS INCLUDING THE LUNGS AND IT'S ONE OF THE MOST DISABLING FORMS OF ARTHRITIS IT'S ALSO HIGHLY PREVALENT IN THE POPULATION AS FAR AS AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE GOES
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00011	ABOUT ONE PERCENT OF THE POPULATION AND I UPDATED THIS SLIDE FROM TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN I HAD TO LAUGH A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE NUMBER OF NAME CHANGES OUR OUR BRONCO STADIUM HAS GONE THROUGH
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00012	I HOPE WE GOT THIS RIGHT NOW IN POWERFUL FIELD BUT ONE PERCENT OF POPULATION SO IF YOU WERE AT A FOOTBALL GAME THAT WOULD BE LITTLE OVER A SECTION FULL OF PEOPLE WITH THIS AUTO IMMUNE DISEASE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00014	SO IT'S ASSOCIATED WITH A LOT OF THINGS FOR AN INDIVIDUAL WITH DISEASE PAIN FATIGUE LOSS OF FUNCTION THERE'S ALSO EXTRA ARTICULAR MANIFESTATIONS HEART DISEASE IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00015	KILLERS PREMATURELY IN RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS SO FOLKS WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS GET HEART DISEASE ABOUT TEN YEARS EARLIER THAN THEY WOULD IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00016	THERE'S MEDICATION TOXICITY VERY EXPENSIVE THERE'S ACTUALLY OVERALL REDUCED LIFE SPANS SO IT'S A VERY IMPACTFUL DISEASE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00018	THE CURRENT PARADIGM OF HOW WE IDENTIFY AND TREAT RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS IS TO TREAT THE DISEASE ONCE IT'S CLINICALLY APPARENT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00019	WHICH IS ONCE SOMEBODY HAS STARTED TO HAVE JOINT SYMPTOMS PAIN STIFFNESS OR SWELLING MADE IT THROUGH THEIR PRIMARY CARE GOTTEN ANY EVALUATION
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00021	FIGURED OUT THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE SOME KIND OF INFLUENCER OR THERAPIST FINALLY REFERRED TO RUMINATOLOGY AND FINALLY MADE A DIAGNOSIS WHICH THAT PROCESS HAS BEEN LOOKED AT IN THE UNITED STATES TAKES ON AVERAGE TWO YEARS FROM THE ONSET OF SYMPTOMS TO THE FINAL DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT FOR RUMINATOLOGY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00023	THAT'S TOO LONG THE DISEASE ACTUALLY DAMAGES WITHIN THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF DISEASE SO AN OVERALL PREMISE THAT I'M GOING TO BUILD ON HERE IS WHAT IF WE COULD FIND OUR
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00024	AND STOP IT BEFORE PEOPLE ACTUALLY STARTED HAVING JOINT DAMAGE I'LL TALK A BIT ABOUT THE RATIONALE FOR THAT STATEMENT AND THAT IDEA AND THEN TALK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING TO TRY AND DO THAT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00026	SO WE NOW KNOW THAT RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS HAS A STAGED OR PHASED SET OF THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN TERMS OF DEVELOPMENT HERE IS A PICTURE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00027	AT WHICH POINT SOMEONE WOULD SHOW UP IN CLINIC AND GET DIAGNOSED BUT NOW WE KNOW FROM A VARIETY OF STUDIES THAT I WON'T GO THROUGH IN HUGE DETAIL IN SHORT TIME TODAY THAT THERE'S A PRECLINICAL OR PRE R A PERIOD
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00028	THIS HAPPENS LONG BEFORE THIS AND ON AVERAGE THREE TO FIVE YEARS BUT IT CAN BE UP TO FIFTEEN TO SEVENTEEN YEARS IN SOME STUDIES WHERE GENES
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00029	ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES COMBINE TO FIRST TRIGGER A PERIOD OF ASYMPTOMATIC AUTOIMMUNITY AND INFLAMATION THAT'S DETECTABLE WITH BLOOD TESTS OR OTHER TESTS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00030	NOW WE'RE WE'RE REALIZING THAT THESE TESTS AND CAN BE ABNORMAL IN YOUR HOSTAL SURFACES AS WELL
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00032	PERSON CAN PROGRESS START DEVELOPING EARLY SYMPTOMS OF RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS BUT NOTHING YOU COULD DEFINE IT IN A CLINICAL EXAM I YOU WOULDN'T SEE A SWOLLEN JOINT THEN IT FINALLY COMES TO THE POINT WHERE THERE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS AND YOU COULD SAY YES THIS PERSON HAS INFLAMMATORY ARTHRITIS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00033	AND THEN ULTIMATELY CLASSIFY THEM AS HAVING ARTHRITIS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00035	AND WE HAVE FOCUSED THE REST OF THE TALK ON THIS PRECLINICAL ALSO CALLED PR A PERIOD AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THAT PERIOD AND HOW WE'RE HOW WE'RE PLANNING TO INTERVENE TO TRY AND PREVENT THE ONSET OF THIS CLINICALLY APPARENT DISEASE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00037	SO THE FIRST LITTLE DIGRESSION HERE IS TO HELP UNDERSTAND HOW WE KNOW ABOUT RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND HOW WE MEASURE IT'S GOING TO DEVELOP IN INDIVIDUALS THERE'S THERE'S AUTO ANTIBODIES I THINK PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH THESE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00038	THERE'S TWO BIG SYSTEMS THAT WE THINK ABOUT IN TERMS OF RHEUMATOID THRUST THERE'S RHEUMATOID FACTOR IT'S BEEN IDENTIFIED FOR DECADES
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00039	NOW THERE'S A NEWER NEWER SYSTEM THAT WE MAY BE LESS FAMILIAR WITH IS CALLED ACPA OR ANTIBODIES TO CITRULLINATED PROTEIN OR PEPTIDE ANTIGENS DEPENDING WHO YOU TALK TO BUT ACPA
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00040	THE CLINICAL TERM THAT WE USE FOR THE CLINICAL ASSAY THAT'S AVAILABLE IN ALL THE LABS IS CALLED A CCP SO ACTUALLY SORT OF AN UMBRELLA TERM CCP IS THE SPECIFIC CLINICAL TERM WHAT THIS MEASURES IS ANIBODY'S
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00041	TO POST TRANSLATION MODIFIED ARGININES INTO CITRULINE SO WE ALL MAKE CITRULINE IN OUR BODY ALL THE TIME IT COMES ALONG WITH INFLAMATION IT COMES ALONG WITH NORMAL PROGRESSION AND ONE OF THE THINGS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00042	THAT THE REASONS WE OFTEN DON'T HAVE WEBBED FINGERS IS BECAUSE UM CITRULLINATION OCCURS WITHIN CELLS AND IT CAUSES THOSE CELLS TO BE ORDERLY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00043	UM A POPTEST AND IN REABSORBED SO SO IT'S PART OF OUR NORMAL PHYSIOLOGY WHAT'S UNUSUAL IS AUTOIMMUNITY TO SECRETORY PROTEINS THAT'S HIGHLY SPECIFIC FOR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00045	JUST TO GET INTO THE WEEDS A LITTLE BIT BUT IT DOES HELP ME EXPLAIN SOME THINGS A LITTLE BIT LATER THE COMMERCIAL ASSAYS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00046	FOR ANTIBODIES TO CIRCULATING ANTIGENS ARE CALLED CCP THEY ACTUALLY MEASURE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00047	ANYBODY'S TO A WHOLE VARIETY OF OF CITRULLINATED PROTEINS CITRULLINATED VIBEGENE OTHER THINGS BUT IT JUST GIVES YOU A ONE READOUT SO JUST A LEVEL
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00048	WE CAN ACTUALLY BREAK THAT APART INTO RESEARCH ASSAYS WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY LOOK AT ANTIBODY TO SPECIFIC CITRULLINATED PROTEINS AND ACTUALLY COUNT THEM UP AND SAY OH AN INDIVIDUAL HAS RHEUMATOID ACTIVITY TO EIGHT CITRULLINATED PROTEINS OR TEN
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00049	LET'S GOING TO HELP UNDERSTAND HOW HOW WE'VE UNDERSTOOD RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS BUT THE COMMERCIAL ASSAY DOESN'T TELL YOU THAT JUST GIVES YOU KIND OF ONE READOUT THAT'S A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ANTIBODY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00050	NOW HERE'S MY MOST COMPLICATED SIDE TO TELL YOU HOW WE THINK GRAMMAR AUTOANTIBODIES DEVELOPS I'LL WALK YOU THROUGH THIS ONE TO MAKE SURE WE UNDERSTAND IT SO THESE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00051	ARE IMAGES FROM A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BLOOD COLLECTED ON AVERAGE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00052	TEN YEARS BEFORE THEY GET RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND THEN AFTER THEY GOT DIAGNOSIS ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE ARE PEOPLE WHO DEVELOP RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE ARE SERIAL MATCH CONTROLS WE GOT THESE FOLKS FROM A THE DEPARTMENT OF
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00053	DEFENSE CYTOKINE REPOSITORY WHICH IS A GREAT RESOURCE IF ANYONE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT HOW YOU CAN LOOK AT NATURAL HISTORY OF DISEASE I CAN I CAN INFORM YOU ABOUT THAT OFFLINE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00054	BASICALLY IF AN INDIVIDUAL IN THE MILITARY DEVELOPS RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS YOU CAN GO FIND THEM AND THEN GO BACK IN TIME AND FIND BLOOD THAT'S BEEN COLLECTED THROUGH THIS DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE SERUM COLLECTION SYSTEM AND LOOK AT BLOOD BEFORE THEY GET DISEASE SO THAT'S A BACKGROUND TO THIS SLIDE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00055	INDIVIDUALS ON THE LEFT HAND PANEL WILL FOCUS THERE DEVELOPED ROMICOTHERAPY AT THIS TIME POINT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00057	AND THEN THESE ARE SORT OF INTERVALS BEFORE THEY DEVELOP FROM PREGNANCY THIS IS A BACK TO THAT POINT I MADE EARLIER YOU CAN MEASURE INDIVIDUAL ANTIBODIES TO A VARIETY OF CYTOKINE ANGIES IF YOU JUST SQUIGHT AT THIS SLIDE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00058	YOU CAN SEE THAT THE RED COLOR INCREASES OVER TIME THAT MEANS INDIVIDUALS ARE DEVELOPING MORE AND MORE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00059	AUTO ANTIBODIES TO A VARIETY OF CITRULLINATED PROTEINS THEY START OFF WITH VERY FEW THEY GET MORE AND MORE AND MORE AND PROGRESS TO THE POINT WHERE THEY GET ALREADY THEY HAVE A LOT OF AUTO ANTIBODIES AND THEN THIS IS THAT THRESHOLD THEY CROSS AND DEVELOP CLINICAL APPARENT DISEASE SO
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00061	FOLLOWING THAT ALSO THERE'S AN ELEVATION OF INFLAMMATION THAT GOES ALONG WITH THAT YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO READ THIS BUT THERE'S A WHOLE LIST OF CYTOKINES DOWN BELOW AND IF YOU CAN KIND OF SQUINT THE RED
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00062	COLORS INCREASE OVER TIME TO THE POINT AT WHICH A HUMOR THERAPY CLINICALLY DEVELOPS AND YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A BASICALLY STORM OF INFLAMMATION THROUGH A VARIETY OF
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00064	IMPORTANTLY THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN AND AND FOLKS WHO DO NOT GET VACCINATED SO IF YOU JUST LOOK AT THE RED COLORS ON THE RIGHT HAND PANELS HERE THERE'S NOT THAT INCREASE OF REDNESS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00066	THERE'S OF COURSE OTHER IMMUNE SYSTEMS THAT ARE GOING AH AH ABNORMAL IN THIS PERIOD THERE'S RUMINATED FACTORS ALSO DEVELOPING ALONG WITH THESE ANTIBODY SUCCINATE PROTEINS THERE'S A WHOLE HOST OF NEW ANTIBODY SYSTEMS THAT WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT AS WE GO IN GREAT DETAIL
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00067	THERE'S GROWING NUMBER OF CELLULAR STUDIES IN THIS PERIOD AS WELL AND KIND OF A LAY PERSON LEVEL WE ONE CAN THINK OF THIS AS A LITTLE BIT OF INFLUENCE AT A CANDLE LEVEL
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00068	PROBABLY FIVE TO TEN YEARS BEFORE YOU GET RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS A CAMP FIRE LEVEL A COUPLE OF YEARS BEFORE AND FINALLY FULL BLOWN FIRE WHICH IS THE CLINICAL DISEASE OF RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00070	YOU CAN START TRIMMING THIS DOWN AND LOOKING AT THIS IN A LITTLE BIT CLEARER WAY AND IF YOU JUST COUNT THE NUMBER OF ACTIVES LIKE IS REFERRING BACK A COUPLE SIDES BACK WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL CAN HAVE ANTIBODIES TO ONE CYTOKINE PROTEIN OR ANOTHER IF YOU JUST COUNT THOSE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00072	WHAT HAPPENS IS PEOPLE START OFF WITH A LOW NUMBER OF ANTI CYTOKINE PROTEINS THAT INCREASES OVER TIME TO THE POINT AT WHICH THEY GET RHEUMATOID THERAPY YOU COUNT THE NUMBER OF STEROIDS ARE ELEVATED THAT INCREASES OVER TIME
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00074	IMPORTANTLY UNDERSTANDING THAT MODEL OF HOW HOW OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM HAS DEVELOPED HAS LED TO WAYS TO USE ANTIBODIES TO PREDICT WHO IS GOING TO GET RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS IN THE FUTURE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00075	AND IT CAN BE BOILED DOWN EVEN MORE SIMPLY WITH A CCP ASSAY AND I I WON'T GO INTO THE DETAILS HERE BUT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00076	ONE OF THE MORE COMMON ASSAYS IS A CCP THREE WHICH IS JUST COMMERCIAL VERSION I CAN USE ONE SINGLE ASSAY THAT GIVES YOU A SINGLE READOUT LEVELS CAN GO
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00077	FROM VERY LOW OR WHAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED NORMAL INCREASE OVER TIME CROSS A THRESHOLD AT WHICH POINTS THEY'RE CONSIDERED POSITIVE AND THEN INCREASE IN A PERSON FINALLY DEVELOPS FROM A TRIAL THRESHOLD
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00078	THIS MAKES PREDICTION QUITE SIMPLE BECAUSE ONE CAN NOW USE ONE COMMERCIAL ASSAY AND SAY WHAT IS YOUR LEVEL AND THEN GET AN ESTIMATE OF YOUR OVERALL RISK FOR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AS WELL AS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00080	WHAT TIME PERIOD IN THE NEAR FUTURE YOU MAY DEVELOP OUR MONETIZATION RIGHT SO THIS FIGURE KIND OF TELLS YOU THAT YOU CAN SEE LEVELS CAN GO UP IN THE LEVEL HERE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00081	IS ON AVERAGE TWO TO FOUR YEARS BEFORE SOMEBODY GETS RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND THIS IS A LEVEL WHICH I WON'T SHOW YOU THIS PICTURE IS UNHEARD OF IN SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T GO ON TO GET RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS BOTH SPECIFIC FOR DISEASE AND HELPFUL IN TERMS OF TIMING OF PREDICTION OF FUTURE DISEASE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00083	IN FACT YOU CAN BOIL THIS DOWN TO A SIMPLE MODEL WHERE I SEE TO BE THREE OF GREATER THAN FORTY UNITS UM GIVES AN OVERALL RISK OF FIFTY PERCENT FOR DEVELOPING RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS WITHIN THE NEXT THREE YEARS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00085	SO WHAT IS HELPFUL HERE IS THESE ACUTE TESTS IN PARTICULAR THAT COMMERCIAL ASSAYS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00087	IS VERY SPECIFIC FOR RUMINATOR ARTHRITIS INDEED IF YOU HAVE SINOBIAS THAT LOOKS LIKE RUMINATOR ARTHRITIS AND THIS TEST IS POSITIVE IT'S REALLY OVER NINE PERCENT SPECIFIC
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00088	IF YOU DON'T HAVE CINEMATICS THERE'S PROBABLY A NINETY PERCENT POSITIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE IN SOME CASE CONTROL STUDIES
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00089	MAYBE AS LOW AS THIRTY PERCENT AND ALLERS BUT REALLY A HIGH POSITIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE THAT YOU WILL DEVELOP
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00091	BUT CERTAINLY AS I'VE MENTIONED BEFORE LIKELIHOOD AND TIMING NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IN PREDICTION THAT'S WHERE THAT MODEL OF AH TEST BEING POSITIVE AND POSITIVE OF A CERTAIN LEVEL GETS YOU BOTH LIKELIHOOD AND TIMING OF AVERAGE ERROR RATE NOW IMPORTANTLY THIS HAS UNDERPINNED
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00092	PREVENTION STUDIES IN HUMAN TRIALS WHERE ONE CAN GO OUT FIND INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE ELEVATIONS OF THESE BIOMARKERS AND THEN INTERVENE TO TRY AND PREVENT OR DELAY THEM FROM GOING ON TO GET HUMAN TRIALS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00093	AND THERE'S A BIT OF A LANDSCAPE OF OUR A PREVENTION THAT'S EVOLVED SINCE I GAVE THIS TALK IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN THERE WAS ONE KNOWN STUDY WHICH IS CALLED THE DUTCH DEXAMETHASON STUDY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00094	WHERE INDIVIDUALS HAD EITHER HIGH LEVELS OF RHEUMATOID FACTOR OR ACTUALLY HAD SOME AGE AND PAINS BUT NO INFLAMMATORY ARTHRITIS WERE GIVEN TWO DOSES OF DEXAMETHAZONE AT A PRETTY WALKING DOSE IT DID NOT PROGRESS TO INFLAMMATORY ARTHRITIS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00095	IT DECREASED THE AUTO ANTIBODIES A LITTLE BIT BUT THIS WAS OVERALL CONSIDERED A NEGATIVE STUDY THAT WAS FOLLOWED UP BY A STUDY CALLED PRAIRIE WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00097	WHERE PEOPLE WHO ARE POSITIVE FOR ACPA ANTI RHEUMATOID FACTOR RECEIVE ONE DOSE OF THE BCELL DEPLETING AGENT RETUXIMAB IT ACTUALLY DID NOT DECREASE OVERALL PROGRESSION AND FIBROMYALGIA BUT IT DID
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00098	SLOW THE ONSET OF DISEASE SO THOUGHT TO BE A SUCCESSFUL TRIAL ALTHOUGH IT WASN'T A COMPLETE PREVENTION A COUPLE OTHER STUDIES HAVE HAD REDOUBTS RECENTLY A STUDY CALLED STAPLE R
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00099	WHERE AT PEOPLE WERE GIVEN ATORVASTATIN TO TRY AND INTERVENE IN FOLKS THAT WERE ACTUALLY POSITIVE TO TRY AND PREVENT FUTURE DISEASE THAT ATORVASTATIN DID NOT WORK AT ALL
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00101	BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT ATORVASTATIN ACTUALLY IN ADDITION TO COLLESTERAL MODULATING FACTORS HAS SOME IMMUNE FACTORS THAT WAS A RATIONAL FOR THAT DOG BUT IT DID NOT WORK AND SO IT'S TAKEN IT OUT OF THE RUNNING FOR TRYING TO PREVENT FUTURE RHEUMATOID ARTHRALGIA
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00102	AND THEN THIS IS JUST A BREAKING NEWS IT'S ONLY BEEN AN ABSTRACT FORM IN THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS HERE A STUDY IN GERMANY WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL THAT MIGHT HAVE ACT UP POSITIVITY OR THE C C P SAY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00103	PLUS EVIDENCE OF INFLAMMATION IN A JOINT ON A MRI BUT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU COULD SEE ON PHYSICAL EXAM OR GIVEN A DRUG CALLED APPETITE SIMULATION BLOCKER
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00104	VERSUS PLACEBO AND AN EARLY REDUCTION HERE IS ACTUALLY DECREASING THE PROGRESSION OF RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS VERY EXCITING FINDINGS BUT THAT NEEDS TO BE FLASHED OUT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00106	BUT WITH THAT AS BACKGROUND FEW YEARS BACK WE DEVELOPED OUR OWN PREVENTION STUDY THAT WE CALL STOP R A IN THE BIG NAME A STRATEGY TO PREVENT THE ONSET OF CLINICALLY APPARENT RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS THIS WAS FUNDED BY THE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00107	THROUGH SPECIAL BRAINS THEY ARE MANY CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE UM WE'RE THE PRINCIPAL SITE HERE WE DEVELOPED THIS STUDY BUT WE'RE OPERATING ON MULTIPLE SITES ACROSS THE COUNTRY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00108	I THINK MY COLLEAGUES CHRIS STEVIE AND MY COLLEAGUES AND UM MARIE FAYZER WHO'S BEEN OUR PRIMARY STUDY COORDINATOR HERE HAVE REALLY HELPED LAUNCH THIS STUDY I THINK ALL OF OUR RHEUMATOLOGISTS IN THE STATE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00109	A LOT OF RHEUMATOLOGISTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND IN A CAST OF THOUSANDS WHICH IS SORT OF A JOKE BUT I'LL TELL YOU IT'S NOT ACTUALLY A JOKE WHEN YOU WHEN YOU SEE WHAT WE'VE HAD TO DO WITH THIS STUDY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00110	SO WHAT WE DID WITH THIS STUDY DEVELOPED AN INCLUSION CRITERIA HARKENING BACK TO A COUPLE SLIDES BACK WHERE WE USED THIS ACTUAL TEST THE CCP THREE TEST THAT WAS TWO TIMES NORMAL
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00111	WITHOUT A HISTORY OF INFLAMMATORY ARTHRITIS WITH A PROJECTED RATE OF DEVELOPMENT OF RHEUMATOLOGY ARTHRITIS OF FIFTY PERCENT BY THREE YEARS WE HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY LEARNED THAT THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT OF AN OVERESTIMATE BUT I THINK THAT STILL NEEDS TO BE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00112	STILL NEEDS TO BE VALUATED FURTHER THAT HAS SOME IMPORTANCE WITH THIS LATER MEASURING THE NEXT COUPLE SLIDES THE INTERVENTION THAT WE SELECTED HERE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00113	WAS RANDOMIZED BLINDED PLACEBO CONTROLLED STUDY USING THE DRUG HYDROXYCHLOROGUINE WHICH IS A BIT OF A MYSTERY ON HOW IT WORKS IT IS ORIGINALLY USED FOR MALARIA TREATMENT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00114	PROBABLY BECAUSE IT ELEVATES THE PH INSIDE OF CELLS CAUSING IT TO BE AN UNHOSPITABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR FOR MALARIA
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00116	THAT PROBABLY ALSO ALTERS IMMUNE FUNCTION OF CELLS AND DAMPENS IT A BIT MAKES CELLS LESS AUTO REACTIVE LESS INFLAMMATORY AND WE THINK THAT'S THE MECHANISM WHY IT WORKS IN A VARIETY OF DISEASES INCLUDE LUPUS AND RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS WHICH IS USED WIDELY FOR
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00117	THE INTERVENTION WAS GIVING THE DRUG FOR ONE YEAR STOPPING FOLLOWING TWO YEARS A FOLLOW UP AFTER THAT TO SEE IF THE DRUG WORKED WAS THERE A DURABLE RESPONSE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00118	IT WAS GOING TO BE SHOOT THE MOON HYPOTHESIS THAT TIME LIMITED DRUG INTERVENTION IN THIS PRE CLINICAL R A PERIOD WOULD RESET IMMEDIATELY TO THE LASTING IMPROVEMENT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00119	THE END POINTS WERE DEVELOPMENT OF CLASSIFIABLE RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS BUT SHOULD HARKEN BACK TO THOSE PICTURES I SHOWED YOU EARLIER BASICALLY A PATIENT WITH SWOLLEN JOINTS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00120	SAFETY WAS ALSO A PRIMARY OUTCOME SO DESIGNED JUST REAL BRIEFLY AN INDIVIDUAL WOULD COME INTO THE STUDY GET ONE YEAR STUDY DRAG WITH A FEW VISITS AND THEN TWO YEARS OFF STUDY DRAG AND TO FOLLOW UP
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00121	SO WE'VE ACTUALLY COMPLETED RANDOMIZATION OF THE STUDY AND WE'RE NOW IN THE FOLLOW UP PHASE A COUPLE PEOPLE ARE STILL ON STUDY DRUG
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00122	WE'VE RANDOMIZED A HUNDRED AND FORTY SUBJECTS WHICH WE REVISED AT WE WERE AIMING FOR TWO HUNDRED TO START WITH AND SOME INTERIM ANALYSES REALIZED WE COULD DO WITH A LITTLE LESS PEOPLE AND FIND FIND A SIGNIFICANT RESULT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00123	AND THE STUDIES ARE GOING SO YOU YOU WON'T GET A PUNCHLINE HERE TODAY HOPEFULLY WE WILL HAVE THIS RED OUT VERY SOON AND I WILL BE ABLE TO
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00124	PROVIDE US AND THE AND THE WORLD FRANKLY WITH THE RESULTS FROM THE STUDY UM I WILL JUST SPEND A COUPLE OF MINUTES HERE IF YOU'RE GOING TO DEVELOP AN AGENT THAT YOU CAN
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00125	PUT INTO AN AT RISK PERIOD OF DISEASE THERE'S A LOT OF CONSIDERATIONS THAT HAVE TO GO INTO THAT IS IT GOING TO WORK UM IS IT GOING TO BE SAFE IS IT GOING TO BE TOLERATED IS IT GOING TO BE COST EFFECTIVE OR PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE WILLING TO TAKE IT SO WE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00126	CONSIDERED ALL THESE THINGS HAD SOME FOCUS GROUPS A FEW YEARS BACK WHERE WE WERE LAUNCHING THIS STUDY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00127	AND WE WERE ARRIVED AT THIS DRUG CALLED HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE OR PLAQUENIL WHICH
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00128	NO ONE HAD EVER HEARD OF BEFORE COVID CAME ALONG AND THEN SUDDENLY EVEN THE PRESIDENT'S TALKING ABOUT THIS ON NEWS CONFERENCES SO WELL A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE STILL AWARE OF IT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00129	IT IS SOMETHING WE USE WIDELY IN HUMAN TRIALS ALREADY IF YOU HAVE ESTABLISHED DISEASE IN NUPUS BUT THIS WAS OUR FINAL CHOICE ANOTHER ASPECT THAT CAME INTO THIS WAS IT WAS A DRUG THAT ANYONE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00130	IT COULD PRESCRIBE IT'S PRETTY SAFE UM IT DOESN'T REALLY REQUIRE SPECIALIST MANAGEMENT OF THE AGENT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00131	IT'S GOING TO WORK IT'S BE A GREAT DRUG SO THIS IS WHY WE'RE TRYING IT AND IT'S ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES CHRISTOPHER BAKER SAID
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00132	THIS IS A DRUG THAT EITHER HAS TO SUCCEED OR FAIL BECAUSE IF WE DON'T LOOK AT THIS DRUG IS COMMONLY USED IN OUR UM PEOPLE WHO ALWAYS WANT TO DOES IT WORK BECAUSE IT'S SO SAFE IN YOU IN IF IT'S EFFECTIVE THAT WILL BE A GREAT OPTION SO THIS IS WHY WE LOOK AT IT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00133	AND THEN WE'LL JUST SAY HERE'S THE JOKE SLIDE THIS IS LIKE SIDE PARK HERE IN DENVER ASK ME SOMETIME OFFLINE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00134	ABOUT USING A DRUG HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE IN A STUDY THAT WHEN YOU STARTED IT NO ONE HAD EVER HEARD OF THE DRUG AND SUDDENLY EVERYBODY WANTS TO TAKE THE DRUG TO PREVENT COVID IT YOU KNOW FOR A FEW MONTHS THERE AND INDEED THE NIH CAME TO US
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00135	WHEN IT WAS LOOKING EARLY DAYS LIKE THERE WAS SOME QUESTION OF WHETHER COVET THAT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS GOING TO WORK ABOUT STOPPING OUR STUDY AND DIVERTING ALL OF THE UH HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE WE HAD
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00136	FOR OUR STUDY INTO CLINICAL TRIALS AGAINST COVID IT'S HARD TO ARGUE AGAINST THAT IF IT'S LOOKED TO BE LIFE SAVING BUT FORTUNATELY THAT DIED DOWN OUR OUR STUDY KEPT GOING BASICALLY UNINTERRUPTED THROUGHOUT THE COVID CRISIS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00138	UH YEAH
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00140	SO OUR ENROLLMENT GOALS FOR THE STUDY WE'RE ACTUALLY HIGHER AND AS I SAID WE WE LOWER THAT ESTIMATE WE WE COMPLETED ENROLLMENT RANDOMIZATION FOR ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR SUBJECTS BACK IN NOVEMBER
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00142	UM IT WAS CERTAINLY A CHALLENGE SO IF YOU THINK A DISEASE LIKE HARKEN BACK TO THAT PICTURE OF THE AH BRONCO STADIUM ONE PERCENT OF PEOPLE ARE AFFECTED BY HYPERTENSION SO THAT MEANS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00143	MAYBE ONE PERCENT ARE PEOPLE ARE WALKING AROUND OUT THERE WHO ARE AT RISK FOR FUTURE ROMAN TRAUMATOLOGISTS THIS IS PROBABLY EVEN LOWER THAN THAT RIGHT BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY'S ACTUALLY GOING TO GET ROMAN TRAUMATOLOGISTS SO THE CHALLENGES OF HOW DO YOU GO TO A
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00144	GROUP OF PEOPLE FIND WHO IS CCP POSITIVE AND GOING TO GET ROOM TO AUTHORIZE IN THE FUTURE AND THEN THE NEXT PART OF THAT IS HOW TO GET THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STUDY AND THAT'S BEEN A HUGE CHALLENGE OF OF THE PROJECT FOR STOP ARE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00145	AND BY I CAN'T THANK PEOPLE ENOUGH WE THANK THE SEVENTEEN STUDY SITES ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT HAVE PARTICIPATED AS WELL AS A HUGE EFFORT OF THE STATE OF COLORADO WE'VE HAD A LOT OF THINGS COME TOGETHER TO HELP US WITH
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00146	ENROLLMENT FOR THE STUDY WE'VE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE NINE HEALTH FAIR THE OUR RESULTS FOUNDATION THE THE CAMPUS HERE A LOT OF PROVIDERS ON CAMPUS WHO FOUND THESE FOLKS IN THEIR CLINICS AND REFERRED THEM TO US A LOT OF RUMINANTISTS ACROSS THE STATE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00147	SO A VARIETY OF WAYS TESTING FIRST DEGREE RELATIVES OR FDRS OF PEOPLE WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS GETS YOU A HIGHER RISK GROUP
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00148	FOR FUTURE WOMEN'S RIGHTS SOMETIMES PEOPLE SHOW UP IN REPRODUCTIVE CLINICS OR PRIMARY CARE CLINICS WITH ACHES AND PAINS AND THEY TEST POSITIVE FOR CCP BUT DON'T HAVE INFLUENCE IN THEIR JOINT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00149	AND THEN WE CAN DO SOME POPULATION BASED APPROACHES I'VE ALREADY MENTIONED WE USE THE NINE HEALTH FARES HERE IN COLORADO EXTENSIVELY OTHER GROUPS THAT HAVE PARTICIPATED WITH US INCLUDING GROUPS IN OKLAHOMA UM ADDED ON A CCP TEST AND A SHORT CONSENT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00150	TO ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO DONATED BLOOD IN OKLAHOMA TESTED THEM ALL FOR CCP AND RECRUITED A LARGE NUMBER OF FOLKS OUT OF THAT GROUP TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR STUDY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00151	WE'VE LOOKED AT SOME OTHER STORE BIOBANKS AT AT SITES INCLUDING MAYO CLINIC AND BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL AND FOUND CCPUS OF THAT WAY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00152	SO THE SCOPE OF THIS AND OTHERS KIND OF BOIL US DOWN IN INTEREST OF TIME IS WE'VE TESTED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS THIRTY THOUSAND IN INDIVIDUALS FOR CCP AT SEVENTEEN SITES ACROSS THE COUNTRY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00153	AT A RATE OF ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE PERCENT POSITIVE OR ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY INDIVIDUALS WERE CCP POSITIVE ED I I I LEFT THIS OUT AT A LEVEL OF CCP AT TWO TIMES THE NORMAL CUTOFFS A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN JUST AN AVERAGE POSITIVE TEST
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00154	AND WE WERE ABLE TO OUT OF THAT FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY PEOPLE RANDOMIZE THE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR OR ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT NOW A BUNCH OF THOSE FOLKS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00155	JOINED THE STUDY FORTUNATELY SOME WERE WILLING TO GET TESTED AND EVEN THEN PRESENTED WITH THE THE DRUG HYDROXYCLORIC ACID AND DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO TAKE A MEDICINE BECAUSE THEY FELT WELL SO DROPPED OUT FOR THAT WAY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00156	AND A PORTION OF THOSE FOLKS DROPPED OUT OF THE STUDY BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY WANTED TO HAVE UNDIAGNOSED RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND SO THAT'S SOME ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES WHEN YOU GET INTO THE PREVENTION GAME AND START SCREENING FOR PEOPLE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00157	ONE FINDING PEOPLE TO TEST UM THE TEST IS FORTUNATELY SPECIFIC FOR OUR SO ONE AVOIDS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00158	MOSTLY FINDING OTHER CONDITIONS THAT YOU GOT TO WORRY ABOUT THIS IS A CONSIDERATION ESPECIALLY WITH THE R A TEST RHEUMATOID FACTOR WHICH CAN BE ELEVATED
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00159	SEE CHRONIC INFECTIONS OR MALIGNANCIES SO FIND SOMEBODY WHO'S RHEUMATOID FACTOR POSITIVE IN ABSENCE OF CCP YOU GOT TO WORRY ABOUT ALL THESE OTHER CONDITIONS YOU MAY HAVE INADVERTENTLY DISCOVERED
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00160	BUT REALLY STCP AVOIDS MOST OF THAT BUT ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES WE'VE HAD IN THE STUDY IS PREVIOUSLY UNDIAGNOSED FROM A RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS AND ONCE YOU FIND SOMEBODY IN THE SCREENING PATHWAY TO IDENTIFY THAT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00161	AND IDENTIFY PATHWAY TO CARE FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT'S A LOT OF ETHICS AROUND THAT IF YOU FIND SOMEBODY IN YOUR SCREENING
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00163	THAT HAS THE DISEASE OF INTEREST AND THEY'RE NOT GOOD FOR YOUR PREVENTION HOW DO YOU HELP THEM GET TO THE RIGHT PLACE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00165	SO THIS IS THE THE CLIFFHANGER HERE THE INTERIM ANALYSIS OF THE STUDY IS PENDING BUT WE HAVE SOME EARLY DATA THAT THIRTY PERCENT OF SUBJECTS HAVE DEVELOPED REMOTE THERAPY PART IN THE IN PART OF THE STUDY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00166	THAT'S A BITTER SWEET FINDING I WOULD JUST SAY ANYBODY WHO'S CCP POSITIVE REALLY DOESN'T REALLY THINK THEY'RE GOING TO GET RUN FOR THERAPY OR THEY'RE CERTAINLY DOESN'T WANT TO GET IT BUT IT IS IMPORTANT IN THIS PREVENTION SITE ACTUALLY HAVE PEOPLE GET YOUR OUTCOME OF INTEREST TO SEE IF YOUR INTERVENTION CAN ACTUALLY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00167	LOWER AN INDIVIDUALS RISK FOR GOING FORWARD SO I WILL KEEP THE CAMPUS AND THE WORLD POSTED ON THIS AS WE LEARN MORE IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS HOPEFULLY BECAUSE WE FULLY RANDOMIZE AND WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE AT LEAST A GOOD INTERIM READOUT VERY SOON
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00169	SO
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00171	IN THINKING ABOUT THIS TRIAL THINKING ABOUT SOME OF THE TRIALS THAT CAME BEFORE IT OR HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED SINCE WE STARTED THIS IT'S REALLY MOSTLY CRITICAL TO LEARN EVERYTHING WE CAN ABOUT ALL ASPECTS OF PREVENTION AS WE MOVE AHEAD BECAUSE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00172	ADMITTEDLY WHEN WE STARTED THIS WE HAD SOME GRASP OF THE CONCEPTS THAT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH BUT AS WE MOVED THROUGH THIS THE WHOLE PROCESS THERE'S JUST HUGE CHALLENGES IN TRYING TO IDENTIFY AND SCREEN AND PREVENT A DISEASE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00173	IN THIS SLIDE IT'S VERY BUSY BUT IT HAS A LOT OF THE ELEMENTS THAT HAVE TO COME TOGETHER SO THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS FINDING SUBJECTS OR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE AT RISK FOR DISEASE AND GETTING THEM TO PARTICIPATE THAT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT CERTAINLY FINDING
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00174	FUNDING FROM VARIETY OF SOURCES GETTING INDUSTRY TO PARTICIPATE YOU CAN IMAGINE INDUSTRY AND HUMANITARIAN THERAPISTS AS A MODEL THAT'S BUILT ON ONCE YOU GET DISEASE IT'S A FOREVER DISEASE WE GOTTA KEEP GIVING YOU DRUGS FOREVER
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00175	BUT IF A PREVENTION APPROACH ACTUALLY ABBRUGATED THAT OR CHANGE THAT INDUSTRY MAY HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT LOOK AT UH UH AT UH AT DISEASE SINCE YOU REALLY WANT TO HAVE THEM INTERESTED IN IN WANTING TO PUSH FOR PREVENTION
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00176	MEASURING LOTS OF OTHER THINGS INCLUDING OUTCOMES IS VERY IMPORTANT GETTING HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS ULTIMATELY IF WE FIND A DRUG THAT WORKS TO PREVENT ROOM TO AUTHORIZE HOW TO LAUNCH THAT INTO ACTUAL CLINICAL CARE A LOT OF THINGS TO THINK ABOUT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00177	I WOULD SAY PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THINKING ABOUT SOME OF THE DRUGS THAT WE THOUGHT WERE GOING TO WORK REALLY WELL TO PREVENT RISK THAT WAS PUBLISHED ALREADY WITH TUXEMAB
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00178	STEROIDS AND THEN WE'LL HAVE TO SEE IF I TAKE A STEP AFTER THIS T C L CO STIMULATION WORKS BUT THINKING ABOUT THE BASIC SCIENCE OF THIS DISEASE DEVELOPMENT DO WE REALLY KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH OUR INVENTIONS ARE WE MAKING THE RIGHT CHOICES
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00180	AND REALLY THIS SLIDE KIND OF HIGHLIGHTS THE STATEMENT HERE UNDERSTANDING THE ARY PATHOGENESIS IS RAPIDLY ADVANCING AND YOU ACTUALLY FUNDAMENTALLY PRIORITIZE OUR NEXT PREVENTION TRIALS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00181	THE GOOD NEWS IS AS I THINK WE HAVE NOW SET IN THE FIELD THAT YOU CAN FIND PEOPLE WHO ARE AT RISK FOR FUTURE ROMATOID ARTHRITIS AND WHO WILL GET ROMATOID ARTHRITIS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00182	THINK THE FIELD IS ALSO THOUGHT IT'S PART WORTHWHILE TRYING TO INTERVENE TO PREVENT THIS DISEASE THAT'S SO THOSE ARE TWO HUGE HURDLES NOW FINDING THE RIGHT APPROACH TO PREVENT IS IS THE NEXT BIG STEP
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00183	AND I'LL JUST A SHOUT OUT TO SOME MEMBERS OF MY DIVISION I THINK YOU CAN HEAR SOME OTHER TALKS THROUGH THE SAME LECTURE SYSTEM GOING FORWARD ABOUT THESE THINGS INCLUDING A MUCOSAL HYPOTHESIS WHICH I WON'T GO INTO IN HUGE DETAIL TODAY BUT TO TOUCH ON THIS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00184	CHRISTIE COON CHRISTIAN DEMERAL BOTH IN THE DIVISION OF MEDICINE MEG AND CHRIS WHO'S A GRAD STUDENT HAS BEEN WORKING ON THIS EXTENSIVELY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00185	LESS UNDERSTAND THAT THE EARLY PHASES OF OUR CLINICAL TRIALS MAY NOT BE IN THE JOINTS AT ALL BUT OTHER SITES AND I THINK IT'LL BE GROUNDBREAKING FOR HOW WE APPROACH PREVENTION IN THE FUTURE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00187	SO HAVE A FIGURE TO KIND OF HIGHLIGHT THIS HERE UM ULTIMATELY WHEN WE WANT TO THINK ABOUT RUMOR TARGET AUTHORIZED HOW IT DEVELOPS AND WHERE WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PREVENT WE WANT TO INTERVENE IN THE FUTURE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00188	WITH WITH APPROACHES THAT ARE ROOTED IN STAGE SPECIFIC BIOLOGY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00190	SO IF WE HAVE A PERSON WHO ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE HAS JOINT DISEASE AND INVOLVED IN A RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS WHERE WE HAVE LOTS OF EXPERIENCE IN DEVELOPING DRUGS AND INTERVENING WITH DRUGS NOW WE'VE TAKEN THAT EXPERIENCE IN MOVE THAT ALL THOSE DRUGS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00191	INTO AN EARLIER PHASE OF RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS HYPOTHESIS CHLOROQUINE EVEN THE TORVOSTAT AND ALL THE OTHER DRUGS I'VE TALKED ABOUT ARE ALL WELL STUDIED IN THE ARTICULAR DISEASE OF RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS WE'RE MOVING HIM AND THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00192	LIKE THE FDA WOULDN'T APPROVE A DRUG THAT'S NOVEL AND PREVENTION OF ALLERGY UNLESS IT'S ALREADY BEEN TRIED IN THE EXISTING DISEASE SO THAT HELPS IT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00193	SO THIS MAKES A LOT OF SENSE BUT I THINK WHERE WE WANT TO THINK ABOUT GOING FORWARD IN RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS IN RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS PREVENTION IS UNDERSTANDING THIS PROPAGATION OR SYSTEMIC IMMUNE PHASE WITHOUT THE ARTHRITIS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00194	AND IDENTIFY WHAT ARE THE NOVEL TARGETS UM IN THIS PERIOD
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00195	PRECISELY IDENTIFY THOSE IN FORGIVEN INDIVIDUALS MAYBE THEY'RE MUCOSAL AND THEN REALLY WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS MAKE THE PUNISHMENT FIT THE CRIME SO IF I CAN
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00196	PROFILE AUTO IMMUNITY AS A CRIME OF HEALTH UM WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND IT AND THEN TARGET THAT APPROPRIATELY SO WE REALLY BALANCE EFFICACY OF AN AGENT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00197	VERSUS RISK AND BENEFIT SO WE DO THE RIGHT THING TO TRY AND PREVENT FUTURE DISEASE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00198	HOPEFULLY THIS WILL NOT ONLY WORK FOR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS IN THE NEAR FUTURE SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR A WAY TO READ OUT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00199	CERTAINLY STOP AROUND AREA FOCUSING BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF OTHER AUTOIMMUNE OR REMATIC DISEASES THAT MAY BE FOLLOWING SIMILAR MODELS OF DEVELOPMENT WHERE THERE'S A PREDISEASE PERIOD THAT WE CAN INTERVENE UPON
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00200	UM ACTUALLY TRIALS ARE UNDERWAY NOW AND LUPUS THAT ARE SIMILAR AND DESIGNED TO STOP OUR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00202	SOME STUDIES IN GOAT THERE ARE SOME STUDIES IN ENCLOSING SPONES SPONES AND RELATED DISEASES INCLUDING SORIATIC AUTHORIZED TRAIN
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00203	I THINK MANY OF YOU ALREADY KNOW ABOUT LOTS OF EXTENSIVE WORK IN TYPE ONE DIABETES SO I WON'T GO INTO THAT TODAY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00204	SO THIS IS KIND OF A BIG DREAM IF WE CAN DEVELOP MODELS TO TAKE SOMEBODY FROM A HEALTHY STANDPOINT FROM WHATEVER ORGAN YOU'RE INTERESTED IN
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00205	INTERVENE WITH STUDIES SUCH AS STOP ALREADY DEVELOPED WAYS TO PREVENT AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S WHERE WE'D LIKE TO GO WITH HOMEOPATHY OUR THERAPISTS AND OTHER DISEASES FRANKLY I'M TIRED AS A HOMEOPATHIST TO WAIT UNTIL SICK PEOPLE COME IN CLINIC IF WE CAN GO OUT AND FIND THEM EARLIER AND INTERVENE EARLIER THAT'S CAN BE GREAT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00207	MY LAST SLIDE IS THERE'S TOO MANY PEOPLE TO PUT ON THIS SO I THANK SOME KEY PEOPLE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00209	MY BOSSES MY HOLLERS AND JILL NORRIS HIS WIFE HAVE DEVELOPED A LOT OF THESE EARLY STUDIES AND REALLY SET A FOUNDATIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS UM THE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00210	THE ORIGINAL STUDIES WERE UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF THE STUDIES OF THE EPILEPSY REMOTE THERAPY SARAH MY COLLEAGUE CHRISTOPHER STEWART WHO'S DRIVEN FORWARD A LOT OF THIS MARINE PHARMACEUTICAL CHRISTIE COON
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00211	UM ARE NOW DIVISION HEAD DEAN PERSON HAVE BEEN HUGELY INSTRUMENTAL IN DRIVING AROUND THESE FOUR WE'VE HAD LOTS OF FUNDING FROM LOTS OF AGENCIES MOSTLY I'D LIKE TO THANK THE NIH
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00212	AID WHO HAVE SUPPORTED OUR STOP OUR RAY TALE WHAT WE'RE GETTING A LOT OF OTHER INSTITUTIONAL FUNDING AND OTHERS TO TO MOVE THIS AHEAD
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00213	AND WITH THAT I WILL STOP AND LEAVE THIS ITEM AND AND ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS I THINK I'VE STILL THE LAST TALK RIGHT I'VE GONE A LITTLE OVER BUT PROBABLY THERE'S TIME FOR QUESTIONS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00215	IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS YOU CAN PLEASE ENTER THEM IN THE CHAT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00217	THINK I CAN SEE THE CHAT BUT I CAN SEE IT BETTER IF I STOP SHARES SO I'M GOING TO STOP SHARING IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00219	NATALIE MAYBE IF YOU CAN SAY I DON'T SEE ANY QUESTIONS IN THE CHAT
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00220	I DON'T SEE ANY EYE ON THAT VISUALLY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00222	ALL RIGHT I GUESS IF NOTHING'S COMING THROUGH ARE WE DONE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00226	WHERE DO ISGS FIT INTO YOUR EVALUATIONS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00228	SO WHAT IS AN I S G
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00230	SO INTERFERE ON SIMULATION GAMES UM THEY CERTAINLY DON'T FIT INTO ANY CLINICAL ASSESSMENTS OR OR LIBRARY ASSESSMENTS DO NOW
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00231	THAT'S IT UM THERE IS A GROWING UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE MAY BE AN INTERFERENCE SIGNAL
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00232	IN THE EARLY PRIOR A PERIOD YOU YOU'VE OPENED THE DOOR FOR A DISCUSSION HERE WE DON'T THINK IN OUR FARON IS A HUGE PLAYER IN ESTABLISHED HUMAN RIGHTS
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00233	BIOLOGICALLY IT LOOKED LIKE IT MIGHT BE FROM OLDER STUDIES INCLUDING SYSTEMIC INFORMATION AND ACTUALLY THE ARTICULAR INFORMATION THAT INTERFERENCE MIGHT PLAY A ROLE IN INTERFERENCE BLOCKADE DID NOT WORK WELL
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00234	AS I MEAN IT'S NOT IMPORTANT IN THIS STABILITY BUT AT LEAST THE DRUGS WE HAD DIDN'T WORK WELL WE THINK THAT ACTUALLY THEY MAY PLAY AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT PART IN THIS VERY EARLY PHASE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00235	SO THIS IS PART OF THAT PICTURE I SHOWED WHERE THINGS WE KNOW WORK AND ESTABLISH RELATIONSHIPS MAY ACTUALLY BE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE NEED TO USE IN EARLIER DISEASE AND SO
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00236	INTERFERENCE AND INTERFERENCE SIMULATIONS ARE A NEW TARGET FOR THINKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF PRE CLINICAL DISEASE BECAUSE MAYBE AT THAT EARLIER STAGE THESE ARE MUCH MORE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT PATHWAYS SO
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00237	THE THE CONCEPT IS THERE WE'RE TRYING TO NOW UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT PATHWAYS ARE THERE TO BE ABLE TO TARGET THEM EFFECTIVELY
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00239	ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM ANYONE
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00241	WELL DR DEAN THANK YOU I APOLOGIZE OUR MODERATOR COULDN'T MAKE IT TODAY BUT UM WE APPRECIATE YOUR SPEAKING
YTB+yXWQtSspq7Q+00243	THANKS THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND I THINK EVERYBODY HAS MY EMAIL FROM CAMPS IF YOU EVER HAVE ANY QUESTIONS TO COME UP LATER THANK YOU
