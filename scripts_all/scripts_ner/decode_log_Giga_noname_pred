POD1000000019_S0000159	MADE FROM HER OLD SESSIONS WITH HIM NOW THAT GENIE'S GOT THE BIGGEST HIT IN THE NATION THESE RECORDS WILL SELL

POD1000000019_S0000170	WHICH IS ALSO THE EXPLANATION FOR WHY GENIE WOULD BE IN LOS ANGELES OPENING UP FOR JOHNNY PAYCHECK WHEN ALL SHE'S SUPPOSEDLY DONE IS ONE BARELY RELEASED SINGLE FOR BLACK ROSE RECORDS
POD1000000019_S0000184	SOMETHING PHYSICAL FOR GENE NEED TO PLAY PRETEND WITH TO KEEP THE WHOLE SCHERADE GOING IT WAS CALLED YOU WRITE THE MUSIC CREDITED TO GENE ROWLEY QUOTE UNQUOTE RELEASED ON LITTLE DARLING RECORDS IN
POD1000000019_S0000188	NOW HERE ARE THE TWO BIG QUESTIONS I DON'T THINK I CAN OR SHOULD EVEN TRY TO ANSWER DID AUBREY MAYHEW AND GENIE C RILEY HAVE AN AFFAIR
POD1000000019_S0000201	SHE GETS TO PICK WILD MOUNTAIN BERRIES WITH GLEN CAMPBELL ON TV
POD1000000019_S0000208	IF YOU'RE STARTING TO GET THE IDEA THAT GENIE'S ALWAYS THOUGHT OF AS LITTLE MORE THAN A PUPPET FOR THE PEOPLE BEHIND THE SCENES OF HER CAREER I WOULD SAY THAT SEEMS ACCURATE
POD1000000019_S0000213	AND WHILE THE SONG IS ACTUALLY SUNG BY THE DAUGHTER CHARACTER WHO DOESN'T DRESS THAT WAY EVERY TIME YOU SEE GENIE C S RILEY SHE LOOKS LIKE MRS JOHNSON
POD1000000019_S0000228	FROM THE NIGHTMARE SHE DESCRIBES YOU'D EXPECT THAT TO BE THE ONLY TIME SHE EVER TOKED UP BUT THIS VIDEO CLIP OF RALPH EMERY INTERVIEWING HER SEEMS TO SUGGEST OTHERWISE
POD1000000019_S0000234	THE ONLY OTHER WOMAN TO DO THAT IN THE NINETEEN HUNDREDS IS DOLLY PARTON WITH NINE TO FIVE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE MAKING GENIE THE FIRST WOMAN TO EVER DO IT IF YOU DON'T COUNT THE FARCE WITH LITTLE DARLING RECORDS
POD1000000019_S0000252	HERE'S HER DOING IT ON THE JOHNNY CASH SHOW
POD1000000019_S0000261	LIKE THE ELLEN TIMES POP CRITIC ROBERT HILLBERG WHO REVIEWED A GENIE C RILEY CONCERT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE UNDER THE HEADLINE LITTLE TALENT
POD1000000019_S0000268	SHE ALWAYS HAD A CRACK BAND BEHIND HER THE HARPER VALLEY EXPRESS THEY USUALLY MADE THE TEMPO OF EVERYTHING FASTER TO REALLY PUT SOME GAS IN THE TANK AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO DENY GENIE'S CHARISMA AS A PERFORMER
POD1000000019_S0000274	NOT ONLY WAS GENIE NOT A ONE HIT WONDER SHE MADE GOOD ALBUMS WITH VERY LITTLE FILLER CHECK OUT THIS ALBUM TRACK FROM NEVER EVEN RELEASED AS A SINGLE CALLED WITHOUT YOU
POD1000000019_S0000277	WITHOUT YOU IS FROM GENIE'S SECOND ALBUM ON MGM AFTER LEAVING PLANTATION RECORDS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO IN WHAT SHELBY SINGLETON CALLED A BREACH OF CONTRACT
POD1000000019_S0000291	OKAY THE EXACT OPPOSITE AUDIENCE OF THE ONLY REASON ANYONE KNOWS GENIE C RILEY'S NAME HARPER VALLEY PTA A SONG HIGHLY CRITICAL OF HYPOCRISY IN SOCIAL GROUPS WITH HARDCORE CONSERVATIVE VALUES
POD1000000019_S0000301	NEXT MOVE ASK TOM TEE HALL TO WRITE ANOTHER HARPER VALLEY PTA A THING HE'D BEEN VERY VOCAL ABOUT HIS RELUCTANCE TO DO BUT ALSO HE'S A BIG SOFTY
POD1000000019_S0000355	AND THAT DISCLAIMER IS WRITTEN BY GENIE'S CO AUTHOR WHO I ALSO FAILED TO MENTION IS A PREACHER HERE'S WHAT HE WRITES QUOTE TO KEEP FROM HURTING SOME OF THE FOLKS GENIE LOVES WE HAVE CHANGED THE NAMES OF SEVERAL PEOPLE IN THE BOOK
POD1000000019_S0000374	ONE THING THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING THAT WE HEARD TODAY IS UNLIKE AS YOU HEARD IN THE SECOND EPISODE OF THE PODCAST LAURA LYNN'S RECORDING OF THE PILL
POD1000000019_S0000378	I THINK MONEY TALKS I THINK THAT BY THE TIME ANY OF THOSE WOULD BE BUZZ KILLS STARTED PAYING ATTENTION THIS SONG WAS ALREADY THE NUMBER ONE POP SONG IN AMERICA AND IT WENT NUMBER ONE POP BEFORE IT WENT NUMBER ONE COUNTRY
POD1000000019_S0000379	EVERY MAJOR RECORD LABEL IN NASHVILLE HAD BEEN FALLING ALL OVER ITSELF FOR FIFTEEN YEARS TRYING TO DO THAT THEY HAD HAD MADE GUNNY C RILEY THE MAYOR OF NASHVILLE IF SHE DID IT A SECOND TIME
POD1000000019_S0000387	THEN TWO YEARS LATER IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE AS GENIE STATED IN THE BOOK THIS IS REALLY AGRAVATING FOR ME TO HAVE TO TALK ABOUT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THIS IS JUST MY FAULT
POD1000000021_S0000006	THAT'S TRINA EDWARDS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HER HUSBAND EDWAN EDWARDS THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF LOUISIANA
POD1000000021_S0000018	ANDREW SERVED EIGHT YEARS ON CORRUPTION CHARGES
POD1000000021_S0000042	THERE WERE SIX GRAND JURY INVESTIGATIONS DURING EDWARDS' FIRST TERM
POD1000000021_S0000046	EDWARDS LED LOUISIANA FOR EIGHT YEARS LEAVING OFFICE IN MARCH NINETEEN EIGHTY
POD1000000021_S0000047	THE ONLY THING STOPPING HIM FROM BEING GOVERNOR FOR LIFE WERE TERM LIMITS THAT EDWARDS HIMSELF HAD PUSHED FOR
POD1000000021_S0000058	EDWARDS WAS RIGHT TO BELIEVE THAT NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE ELECTION WAS A LOCK HE'D WIN IT WITH SIXTY TWO PERCENT OF THE VOTE
POD1000000021_S0000061	IF THERE'S ONE THING LOUISIANA GOVERNOR ELECT EDWARD EDWARDS KNOWS IT'S HOW TO HAVE A GOOD TIME EVEN WITH A FOUR MILLION DOLLAR CAMPAIGN DEFICIT STERING HIM DOWN
POD1000000021_S0000062	EDWARDS CHARTERED TWO JUMBO JETS ANNOUNCED HE WAS GOING TO PARIS AND INVITED ANYONE WILLING TO CONTRIBUTE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO COME ON A LAW
POD1000000021_S0000096	WHEN I ASKED EDWARDS ABOUT THE CASE HE DIDN'T SOUND ALL THAT SORRY
POD1000000021_S0000111	BUDDY ROME WAS A CONGRESSMAN FROM NORTH LOUISIANA
POD1000000021_S0000121	THERE WOULD BE NO RUNOFF ROMER WOULD BE THE NEXT GOVERNOR OF LOUISIANA
POD1000000021_S0000123	BUT THAT'S NOT HOW EDWARD SAW IT DROPPING OUT OF THE RACE THAT WAS THE FIRST STEP IN HIS COMEBACK PLAN
POD1000000021_S0000133	IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE DAVID DUKE WAS AT THE HEIGHT OF HIS POWERS

POD1000000021_S0000167	IN REALITY DUKE'S BRAND OF POPULISM HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH SHRINKING GOVERNMENT
POD1000000021_S0000169	DUKE'S MESSAGE THE JOURNALIST JOHN MAGGINES WROTE A LOT OF APPEAL FOR THE CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN OF HUEY LONG'S OLD VOTERS
POD1000000021_S0000172	THEY WANT TO SEE WHERE YOU LONG WAS SHOT AND WHERE DAVID DUKE SITS
POD1000000021_S0000181	ROGER'S BIG INITIATIVE WAS A PLAN TO MODERNIZE THE STATE'S APPROACH TO TAXATION
POD1000000021_S0000184	ROMA WAS ADAMANT THAT HIS FISCAL REFORM PLAN WAS NOT A TAX INCREASE
POD1000000021_S0000187	DAVID DUKE THEN A NEWLY ELECTED STATE LEGISLATOR WAS ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S MOST OUTSPOKEN CRITICS
POD1000000021_S0000197	DIGGING LOUISIANA IS ALREADY TROUBLED ECONOMY EVER DEEPER IN DEBT AND FORCING REFORMED MINDED GOVERNOR BUDDY ROME TO SCRAMBLE HIS WAY OUT OF A NEW FINANCIAL CRISIS

POD1000000021_S0000225	IN HIS STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS ROMER APOLOGIZED TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR HIS INFLEXIBILITY AND INSENSITIVITY
POD1000000021_S0000228	FOR STRAWBERRY THE SELF HELP STUFF WAS BAD BUT WHAT HAPPENED NEXT WAS WORSE

POD1000000021_S0000242	IDEOLOGY ASIDE ROMER THOUGHT THE MOVE WAS SMART STRATEGY
POD1000000021_S0000243	EDWARD EDWARDS WAS GOING TO GRAB VOTES FROM HIS LEFT NO MATTER WHAT
POD1000000021_S0000244	ROGER FIGURED THAT BRANDING HIMSELF A REPUBLICAN WOULD HELP STAVE OFF RIGHT WING CHALLENGERS WHO MIGHT THREATEN HIS REELECTION
POD1000000021_S0000245	THE STATEWIDE POLL SHOWED THAT THE TOP THREE CANDIDATES ARE DUKE EDWARDS AND MYSELF
POD1000000021_S0000250	DEMOCRATS IN LOUISIANA FELT BURNED BY ROMER AND REPUBLICANS INCLUDING STATE PARTY OFFICIALS WEREN'T SURE THEY COULD TRUST HIM EITHER
POD1000000021_S0000252	RESENTED THAT ROGER HADN'T INCLUDED HIM IN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE PARTY SWITCH AND ROGER FORGETTING THE LESSONS OF ALL I EVER NEEDED TO KNOW I LEARNED IN KINDERGARTEN CURSED OUT AN UNGUARDED RATHER THAN TRYING TO APPEASE HIM
POD1000000021_S0000254	THAT ENDORSEMENT WOULDN'T GO TO BUDDY ROMER OR DAVID DUKE
POD1000000021_S0000260	THEN DUKE WAS AGGING THEM ON YOU KNOW TO DISRUPT THINGS
POD1000000021_S0000263	BUTTY ROME HAD TRIED TO CONSOLIDATE THE CONSERVATIVE VOICE
POD1000000021_S0000296	BY NINETEEN NINETY ONE THE OPEN PRIMARY WAS OPEN IN A WAY EDWARDS MAYBE HADN'T ANTICIPATED
POD1000000021_S0000305	DUKE COULD PASS THE BUCKET WITH IMPUNITY DURING HIS NINETEEN NINETY SENATE CAMPAIGN BECAUSE THAT WAS A FEDERAL
POD1000000021_S0000307	HAMBRICK BY THESE NEW RULES DUKE HELD FEWER RALLIES AS A CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR THAN WHEN HE RAN FOR THE SENATE AND EDWARDS' FUNDRAISING SLOWED TO A TRICKLE

POD1000000021_S0000326	THE PROBLEM FOR ROGER WAS THAT A LOT OF SWING VOTERS FELT DRAWN TO ANOTHER CANDIDATE
POD1000000021_S0000343	IT WASN'T CLEAR BASED ON POLLING HOW WHITE PEOPLE IN LOUISIANA WERE RESPONDING TO DUKE'S LATEST ATTEMPT AT IMAGE MANAGEMENT

YOU1000000021_S0000004	THE DW IS A CONTINUOUSLY SPINNING SLOT MACHINE SYSTEM THAT CONFERS VARIOUS BONUSES EFFECTS AND ATTACKS BASED ON THE RESULTS INCLUDING HOW ZACK LEVELS UP
YOU1000000021_S0000007	THE GAME BEGINS WITH ZACK FAIR SOLDIER SECOND CLASS OF THE GROUP CALLED SOLDIER A PRIVATE MILITARY ARMY OWNED BY THE GENERAL ELECTRIC POWER COMPANY IN THE CITY OF MIDGAR
YOU1000000021_S0000009	ZACH HAS TREMENDOUS SKILLS AND TALENT BUT IS UNFORTUNATELY A LITTLE OVERCONFIDENT AND RECKLESS AT TIMES AS POINTED OUT BY HIS FELLOW SOLDIER ANOTHER FIRST CLASS NAMED
YOU1000000021_S0000011	AND YEAH HELPS HIM OUT REMINDING HIM TO TEMPER HIS ASPIRATIONS WITH PASSIONATE DREAMS AND STEADFAST HONOR
YOU1000000021_S0000012	ZACHARIAH HEARS FROM A FELLOW SOLDIER OF THE MASS DERSERVED OF TROOPS IN SOLDIER AND HE'S SOON CALLED IN TO SPEAK WITH THE DIRECTOR OF SOLDIER A MAN LYNCH
YOU1000000021_S0000019	SUDDENLY ANGELE GOES MISSING AND SEPHIROTH SUSPECTS HE TOO HAS BETRAYED THEM AND DESERVED THOUGH ZACH FERVENTLY DENIES IT
YOU1000000021_S0000020	AFTER THE MISSION DIRECTOR LAZAR CONFIRMS ANGO REALLY IS GONE FOR UNKNOWN REASONS BUT ASSIGNED ZACK ON A NEW MISSION
YOU1000000021_S0000027	FINDING ANGIE'S MOTHER JILIAN SHE NOTES ZACH IS THE WRESTLE'S PUPIL ANGELOTTE SPOKE ABOUT AND SHE TELLS HIM GENESIS CAME BY A MONTH AGO WITH AN ARMY OF MINIONS AND PRECEDED TO START KILLING TOWNS
YOU1000000021_S0000045	AS SEPHORA TALKS MORE ZACK HE ELABORATES MORE HOW ANGEL GENESIS AND HIMSELF WERE CLOSE FRIENDS AND EVEN THOUGH SEPHORA HIMSELF WAS THE COMPANY'S PRIZED WAR HERO GENESIS HIMSELF WANTED SUCH PRESTIGE AS WELL
YOU1000000021_S0000048	SURVEYING THE MONSTER SEPARATES A DUE OUR IN LEAGUE WITH DR HOLYLAND WHICH TIES INTO THE STORY HE JUST TOLD
YOU1000000021_S0000054	HOLLANDER HERSELF APPEARS SURPRISED TO SEE THEM BUT EXPLAINS ONLY HE CAN SUB GENESIS DEGRADATION AFTER WHICH GENESIS HIMSELF APPEARS AND EXPLAINS HOLLANDER WON'T BE CAPTURED
YOU1000000021_S0000063	SHE'S NATURALLY SURPRISED AND ACTUALLY LIKES HIS UNIQUE EYES TO WHICH ZACH CONTINUES TO FLIRT SHOWING OFF THE TRADEMARK MACHO UNISEX EYES OF A SOLDIER
YOU1000000021_S0000069	LATER ZACK GOES TO VISIT AERITH WHEN SONG HALTS HIM TO CALL HIM INTO A MISSION TO MODEOHAIME AND GIVE ZACK PAUSE WHEN HE SAYS HE ALSO KNOWS AERITH WHILE WON'T ELABORATE
YOU1000000021_S0000072	ZACH IS FROM THE TINY VILLAGE OF GONGGA AND THIS VILLAGE IS FROM NEVADA WHO INTRODUCES HIMSELF AS CLOUD
YOU1000000021_S0000073	AS THE MISSION FOR HOLLAND CONTINUES GENESIS MOVES TO KILL HIM AS HE'S ALREADY BEGIN VISIBLY DEGRADING AND CLAIMS HE DOESN'T NEED HOLLAND ANYMORE
YOU1000000021_S0000076	ON HIS WAY OUT HE IS MET BY ANGELA AS WELL AS HOLDER WHO EXPLAINED THE G AND PROJECT G WAS NOT FOR GENESIS BUT FOR JILLIAN WHO WAS ANGELA'S MOTHER WHO APPARENTLY TOOK HER OWN LIFE EARLIER
YOU1000000021_S0000077	THE EXPERIMENT WAS TWOFOLD JILIAN HAD JENOVA CELLS INJECTED INTO HER WHILE SHE WAS PREGNANT WITH ANGEL AND GENESIS SIMPLY HAD JENOVA CELLS IMPLANTED DIRECTLY INTO HIM AS A TEST TUBE BABY
YOU1000000021_S0000079	REASON BEING ANGEL CAN USE THE JEMOVA CELLS AS A TWO WAY CONDUIT AS INTENDED ANGEL THEN EXPLAINS HIS CELLS CAN ABSORB GENETIC TRAITS AND PASSIVE TO OTHERS BEYOND WHAT GENESIS CAN MANAGE WHICH IS ONLY IMPRINT THEM ONTO OTHERS
YOU1000000021_S0000082	AFTER WINNING A BITTER VICTORY A DEGRADING ANGEL IS GRATEFUL THAT ZACH ENDED HIM WITH DIGNITY AND HONOR BEFORE DYING HE PASSES ON HIS FAMILY SWORD AND LEGACY OF HONOR THE BUSTER SWORD TO ZACK
YOU1000000021_S0000088	SHE TEASES HIM ABOUT HIS GIRLFRIEND ARIATH AND EXPLAINS SHE'S UNDER CONSTANT TURK SURVEILLANCE AS IT TURNS OUT SHE IS THE LAST LIVING MEMBER OF A RACE CALLED THE ANCIENT
YOU1000000021_S0000089	ZACH IS SURPRISED NOT ONLY TO LEARN THIS BUT ALSO THAT ARTHUR NEVER TOLD HIM
YOU1000000021_S0000092	AND SO ZACK'S VACATION IS OVER AS THE THREE OF THEM ARE TO INVESTIGATE ATTACK ON JUNGLE
YOU1000000021_S0000093	IT TURNS OUT MORE GENESIS CLONES WERE ATTACKING AND THIS TIME HOLYLDER WAS EVEN THERE THOUGH HE GETS AWAY ONCE AGAIN
YOU1000000021_S0000095	RETURNING TO AERITH HE FINDS A MONSTER DOG THERE BUT IT'S NOT REALLY CAUSING PROBLEMS THOUGH ZACK NOTES IT'S ALSO AN ANGEL COPY AND IT SEEMS KEEN TO PROTECT AERITH
YOU1000000021_S0000101	AS THEIR MISSION IN MENTIONS NOTHING OF THEIR OLD FRIENDS SOPHIA PRIVATELY CONFESSES TO ZACK THAT HE'S SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING LEAVING CHENERA AS WELL DEPENDING ON WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS MISSION
YOU1000000021_S0000105	AS THEY ARRIVE SEPHORA MAKES SMALL TALK ASKING CLAUDE HOW IT FEELS TO BE HOME AGAIN AND TRYING TO RELATE AS HE HAS NO ORIGINAL TOWN AND ALL HE KNOWS IS HIS MOTHER'S NAME TO BE JENOVA WHO DIED AFTER HE WAS BORN
YOU1000000021_S0000106	IN TOWN THEY ARE MET BY A LOCAL TOWN GIRL BY THE NAME OF TIFA
YOU1000000021_S0000107	WHEN TIVA LEARNS SHE'S A SOLDIER FIRST CLASS SHE SEEMS SURPRISED BY THE FACT THAT THEY ONLY SENT HIM IN CEPHRA AND BEGINS TO ASK SOMETHING ELSE BUT STOPS AND RUNS OFF INSTEAD
YOU1000000021_S0000117	SEPHEROTH COMES A HORRIFYING HYPOTHESIS THAT IT'S POSSIBLE HE WAS CREATED THE SAME WAY AND IT BECOMES A CRISIS OF IDENTITY IRONICALLY IDENTICAL TO HIS FRIENDS GENESIS AND ANGEL
YOU1000000021_S0000128	AFTERWARDS CLOUD WISHES HE WERE STRONG LIKE ZACH BUT ZACH WARNS HIM NOT TO GET TANGLED UP WITH SOLDIER
YOU1000000021_S0000132	IS SUDDENLY ON FIRE WITH MANY TOWN SPEAKERS SLAIN EVEN CLOUD IS BEATEN ONCE AGAIN AND AROUND THE CORNER AS CEPHALOTH HIMSELF CLOMLY STANDING AMIDST THE FLAMES
YOU1000000021_S0000135	CONFRONTING SEPHIROTH ZACH IS IGNORED AS SEPHIROTH INSISTS HIS MOTHER THE ANCIENT WAS THE SUPERIOR RACE AND THEY SHOULD HAVE RULED THE PLANET
YOU1000000021_S0000137	FINALLY FED UP WITH THE CRIMES OF HUMANS AND SCHINER IN PARTICULAR SEPHORE SEES WHAT ANGELIN GENESIS KEPT WARNING ABOUT AND CHOOSES TO STAND ALONE
YOU1000000021_S0000152	CLOUD SUCCUMBS TO HIS INJURIES NEXT TO ZACK AND AS THEY BOTH PASS OUT DR HOJO ARRIVES ON THE SCENE AND CHOOSES CLOUD TO BE HIS NEXT TEST SUBJECT
YOU1000000021_S0000156	HOWEVER SHINER LABELS IN BOTH FUGITIVE SAMPLES SO THEY FIND THEMSELVES NOW RUNNING FROM THE ARMY AND SITNA ACTUALLY MANDES TO CATCH UP TO THEM FIRST
YOU1000000021_S0000157	HE PLEADS WITH HER TO JUST WALK AWAY AS HE KNOWS IT'S TALL ORDER TO ESCAPE THE TURKS BUT SITNA CHOOSES HER DUTY OVER PERSONAL FEELINGS
YOU1000000021_S0000161	HE KNOWS THAT ARE HOJO'S LATEST EXPERIMENTS AND MODIFIED VERSIONS OF JENOVA'S POWER RUNS THROUGH BOTH OF THEM
YOU1000000021_S0000171	ZACH STOPS TO FINALLY CONFRONT THE FAILED AND TORTURED CREATION OF A JENOVA INFUSED HUMAN WHO CONSIDERS ZACH A PERFECT FUSION OF ANGEL'S WILL AND SEPARATED CELLS
YOU1000000021_S0000185	MEANWHILE SONG ORDERS CYNTHIA AND THE OTHER TURKS TO FIND AND SAVE SACK BEFORE THE ARMY FINDS THEM WHICH CYNTHIA IS VERY MOTIVATED TO DO
YOU1000000021_S0000186	THOUGH THIS IS THE NEAR TREES IN HIS ACTION SONG IS WILLING TO RISK IT FOR HIS FRIEND AND FOR AIRLY'S SAKE
YOU1000000021_S0000188	UNFORTUNATELY THE ARMY INTERCEPTS ZACH FIRST AND ZACH WILLINGLY CHOOSES TO FIGHT AND HONORABLY PROTECT CLOUD DESPITE HIS OWN DESIRE TO RETURN TO ERIT AND SAVE HIMSELF
YOU1000000021_S0000194	AGAINST ALL ODDS ZACH TRIUMPHS IN HIS FINAL STAND BUT HE IS ON HIS LAST LEGS AS CHINA BECOMES REINFORCING THEIR TROOPS FIRING COUNTLESS BULLETS INTO A RELENTLESS ZACH
YOU1000000021_S0000199	MEANWHILE CALDWELL FINALLY WAKES UP AND DRAGS HIMSELF OVER TO SACK WHO IS STILL BARELY ALIVE AND FORCES A SMILE FOR HIM AND URGES CLAUD TO LIVE ON IN HIS OWN LIVING LEGACY
YOU1000000021_S0000204	AS THE GAME ENDS THE TRAUMA OF THE EVENTS UNFORTUNATELY RESULTED IN CLOUD BLOCKING ALL MEMORY OF ZACK DESPITE HIS PROMISE

YOU1000000123_S0000041	STARTING IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE WORKING WITH RICHARD THAYER AT UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO
YOU1000000126_S0000013	UM AND THANKS EVERYONE FOR JOINING US AND FOR STICKING WITH US THROUGH THE END OF THIS CONFERENCE
YOU1000000128_S0000011	AND LET US GET US TO HOME LET US GET US TO EUROPE AND ONE OF THESE THINGS THAT I'VE SEEN GEORGE DO TIME AND TIME AGAIN IN EUROPE IS SOMETHING THAT ALSO REALLY CORRECTOR AND THAT IS STANDING UP FOR THE UNDERDOG
YOU1000000128_S0000030	THAT'S WHEN IRANIAN GENERAL SADDAM HUSSEIN WAS ASSASSINATED IN IRAQ
YOU1000000129_S0000008	CARNEGIE WAS AT ONE POINT THE RICHEST AMERICAN IN HISTORY BUT HE WASN'T BORN IN AMERICA
YOU1000000129_S0000009	ANDREW'S STORY BEGINS ACROSS THE ATLANTIC OCEAN IN DUNFERMLINE SCOTLAND WHERE HE GREW UP IN WHAT COULD ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS ABJECT POVERTY
YOU1000000129_S0000022	CARNEGIE WOULD PROFIT FROM IT HE WAS ABLE TO ESCAPE HARM'S WAY AFTER PAYING EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS FOR A SUBSTITUTE TO TAKE HIS PLACE ON THE BATTLEFIELD IT WAS DURING THIS TIME THAT CARNEGIE NOTICED THAT THE WOODEN BRIDGES WERE EASILY BURNED BY THE TROOPS
YOU1000000129_S0000025	OWNING THE IRON SOURCE MEANT THAT CARNEGIE'S BRIDGE BUILDING COMPANY WOULD NOT BE DEPENDENT ON MINING OR EXTRACTING COMPANIES FOR IRON LIKE THEIR COMPETITORS THIS NOT ONLY GAVE CARNEGIE MORE CONTROL OVER THE ENTIRE PROCESS IT ALSO IMPROVED THEIR MARGINS
YOU1000000129_S0000044	HENRY CLAY FRIK AS A TEAM CARNEGIE AND FRIK WERE A POWERFUL FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH AND TO SHOW HOW RUTHLESS THE TWO COULD BE LOOK NO FURTHER THAN THE STORY ABOUT DUCANE WORKS
YOU1000000129_S0000059	IN EIGHTEEN NINETY EIGHT NINE PERCENT OF ALL STEEL WORKERS INDUSTRY WIDE WOULD DIE ON THE JOB WHEN THE WORKERS REFUSED FRICK'S AGGRESSIVE DEMANDS FOR LONGER HOURS AND LESS PAY HE DECIDED TO LOCK OUT ALL EMPLOYEES
YOU1000000129_S0000076	AS THE STORY GOES JP MORGAN GLANCED AT THE OFFER AND WITHOUT HESITATION ACCEPTED IT MORGAN WOULD BUY CARNEGIE STEEL FOR FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS MAKING CARNEGIE THE SINGLE RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD AT THE TIME
YOU1000000129_S0000077	CARNEGIE WOULD COMPLETELY CUT TIES WITH HIS BUSINESS LIFE AND DEDICATE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF HIMSELF TO SERVING THE WORLD THROUGH PHILANTHROPY NOT A SINGLE DOLLAR WOULD BE LEFT TO HIS FAMILY
YOU1000000129_S0000078	BECAUSE ANDREW HAD ONLY FIVE YEARS OF SCHOOLING HE HAD A SOFT SPOT FOR LIBRARIES WHICH HE CREDITS FOR HELPING HIM ACHIEVE THE FINANCIAL SUCCESS HE ACQUIRED
YOU1000000129_S0000080	ONE EXAMPLE OF HIS GENEROSITY IS CARNEGIE HALL ONE OF NEW YORK'S MOST RECOGNIZABLE LANDMARKS BUILT IN EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE CARNEGIE BUILT AND DONATED THE BUILDING AS THE MUSIC HALL
YOU1000000129_S0000085	PERHAPS HE VIEWED DONATING HIS MONEY AS A WAY TO ATONE FOR HIS BUSINESS SINS MAKING MONEY IS A GREAT FEELING BUT AN EVEN BETTER FEELING IS GIVING IT AWAY IF YOU WANT TO GROW WEALTH AND PERHAPS DONATE TO NOBLE CAUSES LIKE KARENGEE
YOU1000000130_S0000011	BY THE TIME HENRY HAD BECOME A TEENAGER THE STEAM ENGINE WAS ALREADY MAKING ITS WAY INTO THE FARMING COMMUNITY COW POWERED THRESHING MACHINES AND SAWMILLS WERE BECOMING COMMON SIGHT AND HENRY WAS LEARNING HOW THEY WORKED AND HOW TO FIX THEM
YOU1000000130_S0000017	IT IS DURING THIS TIME THAT HENRY BY CHANCE LEARNED ABOUT THE GAS ENGINE FROM A BRITISH MAGAZINE IT WAS BEING PRODUCED IN SMALL NUMBERS BY A GERMAN ENGINEER NICHOLAS
YOU1000000130_S0000018	AND IT WAS GAINING SOME TRACTION IN EUROPE BUT IT WAS PRACTICALLY UNHEARD OF IN AMERICA HENRY WOULD GET THE CHANCE TO WORK ON SUCH AN ENGINE HIMSELF IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE AND HE INSTANTLY RECOGNIZED THE ADVANTAGES IT HAD
YOU1000000130_S0000020	THIS ALSO ALLOWED THE GAS ENGINE TO START QUICKLY WHEREAS STEAM ENGINES OF THE TIME NEEDED AS MUCH AS THIRTY MINUTES TO HEAT UP THE WATER AND GENERATE ENOUGH STEAM TO START WORKING THE GAS ENGINE WAS AN INNOVATION HENRY FELL IN LOVE WITH
YOU1000000130_S0000023	IT WAS GENERATING ELECTRICITY FOR OVER A THOUSAND HOMES IN DETROIT AND IT WAS DOING SO BY USING STEAM ENGINES SO HENRY WAS A NATURAL HIRE FOR THEM WHENEVER THE ENGINES BROKE HENRY HAD TO FIX THEM BUT WHENEVER THEY WERE WORKING
YOU1000000130_S0000029	HE HAD DRIVEN A THOUSAND MILES IN IT HENRY BUILT A SECOND QUADRICYCLE AND THEN A THIRD ONE ALWAYS IMPROVING THE DESIGN BEFORE FINALLY FEELING CONFIDENT ENOUGH IN EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE TO START HIS OWN COMPANY
YOU1000000130_S0000032	AND EVERYONE WAS EAGER TO SEE WHAT HENRY COULD CREATE WITH PROPER CAPITAL HENRY'S PLAN WAS VERY CLEVER SINCE HE PERSONALLY KNEW MANY OF THE INDUSTRIALISTS IN DETROIT BY THAT POINT HE'D TRY TO BUILD AN AUTOMOBILE THEY COULD USE IN THEIR BUSINESSES
YOU1000000130_S0000033	HE LEASED A FACTORY AND PLANNED TO HIRE ONE HUNDRED WORKERS TO MAKE HIS NEW DELIVERY WAGON AS HE CALLED IT BUT IT TURNED OUT THAT BUILDING SUCH COMPLEX MACHINES IN HIGH NUMBERS WAS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT THAN HENRY IMAGINED
YOU1000000130_S0000041	HENRY LABELED HIS FIRST DESIGN AS THE MODEL A AND WORKED HIS WAY THROUGH THE ALPHABET OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS SUSTAINED BY CAPITAL FROM HIS FRIENDS AND FAMILY
YOU1000000130_S0000044	THE BIGGEST GAME CHANGER OF ALL HOWEVER WAS HENRY'S CHANCE VISIT TO A SLAUGHTERHOUSE IN CHICAGO HE SAW THERE WAS SOMETHING INTERESTING A DISASSEMBLY LINE SO TO SPEAK WHERE MULTIPLE WORKERS WOULD PROCESS CARCASSES MOVING DOWN THE LINE
YOU1000000130_S0000049	IT IS ACTUALLY DURING THE PRODUCTION OF THIS MODEL THAT HENRY WOULD FIRST USE THE ASSEMBLY LINE PROCESS TO AT LEAST PARTIALLY ASSEMBLE SOME OF HIS CARS
YOU1000000130_S0000060	THEY WOULD HELP HIM TRANSITION HIS ENTIRE MANUFACTURING PROCESS TO USE VANADIUM STEEL IT WAS THEIR CHIEF ENGINEER THAT BUILT THE HEAT TREATMENT PLANT FOR HENRY IN
YOU1000000130_S0000068	HENRY HAD BEGUN A NEW AGE IN AMERICAN HISTORY THE AGE OF THE AUTOMOBILE AND IT WAS HIS COMPANY THAT WOULD TOTALLY DOMINATE IT IN ITS FIRST TWO DECADES
YOU1000000130_S0000069	IT WASN'T UNTIL THE END OF THE NINETEEN TWENTYS THAT THE REST OF THE AUTO INDUSTRY CAUGHT UP TO HENRY BUT AT THAT POINT HE WAS ALREADY ONE OF THE RICHEST MEN ALIVE
YOU1000000131_S0000005	THE ORIGINS OF HISTORY'S GREATEST OIL MONOPOLY ARE ACTUALLY PRETTY HUMBLE IT ALL STARTS IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE WITH THE BIRTH OF JOHN ROCKAFELLER IN UBSTAD NEW YORK HE WAS THE ELDEST SON OF A TRAVELING MERCHANT
YOU1000000131_S0000008	SO THEY COULD ALL LIVE TOGETHER IN THIS VERY CONFUSING HOUSEHOLD JOHN WOULD GROW UP LEARNING HOW TO HUSTLE PEOPLE FOR THE BEST DEAL POSSIBLE AND HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF EVERY PENNY HE GOT HIS FAMILY WOULD RARELY STAY IN ONE PLACE FOR LONG
YOU1000000131_S0000009	AND JOHN WOULD LIVE THIS NOMADIC LIFE EVER SINCE HE WAS THREE YEARS OLD TO HELP HIS MOTHER JOHN WOULD EARN ANY MONEY HE COULD BY RAISING TURKEYS OR DOING WORK FOR NEIGHBORS HIS INTELLIGENCE WAS PUT TO GOOD USE
YOU1000000131_S0000012	THANKS TO HIS GOOD REPUTATION HE GOT A LOAN OF FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH AT THE TIME WAS A HUGE SUM JOHN STARTED TRADING HAY GRAIN AND VARIOUS MEATS AND IN HIS FIRST YEAR HE RECORDED SALES OF HALF A MILLION DOLLARS
YOU1000000131_S0000019	FOR THE BY PRODUCTS OF REFINING PETROLEUM YOU SEE THE EARLY REFINERIES IN CLEVELAND COULD ONLY OPERATE AT ABOUT A SIXTY PERCENT EFFICIENCY BUT JOHN NOT ONLY INCREASED THAT PERCENTAGE HE ALSO STARTED SELLING ALL THE BY PRODUCTS LIKE PARAPHENOL
YOU1000000131_S0000025	OF COURSE NOT EVERYONE WOULD GIVE UP IMMEDIATELY AND OVER TIME JOHN ERODED THE PRICE OF OIL AND CARBON SOMETIMES BY AS MUCH AS EIGHTY PERCENT IN ORDER TO STRANGLE COMPETITORS UNSURPRISINGLY HIS STRATEGY WORKED
YOU1000000131_S0000033	THEN TO SHOWCASE HIS SUCCESS JOHN BUILT AN IMPRESSIVE HEADQUARTERS FOR HIS COMPANY ON BROADWAY THIS MOMENT WAS THE HIGH POINT OF ROCKEFELLER STANDARD OIL
YOU1000000131_S0000040	AND BROKE THE COMPANY UP INTO THIRTY FOUR SEPARATE ENTITIES OF COURSE JOHN ROCKAFELLER KEPT HIS STAKE IN THOSE COMPANIES UNTIL HIS DEATH AND IN FACT IT TURNS OUT THAT THE BREAKUP WAS THE MOST PROFITABLE EVENT IN HIS LIFE

POD1000000010_S0000145	AND I WANT TO MENTION THAT REPORTS OF THE SHOOTING SAID THAT JESSE HIMSELF SHOWED INCREDIBLE COURAGE
POD1000000010_S0000147	YEAH AND SCARLETT'S DEFINITION OF COURAGE IS EVEN BIGGER THAN THAT SORT OF
POD1000000010_S0000154	IT'S ALSO SCARLETT SAYS THE COURAGE TO STAND UP TO SOMEONE WHO'S BULLYING YOU OR SOMEONE YOU KNOW BY TAKING THEIR PERSPECTIVE AND SEEING THE WORLD THROUGH THEIR EYES
POD1000000010_S0000160	YOU KNOW HEARING ABOUT COURAGE IN THAT WAY IN THAT MOMENT REALLY SPOKE TO ME COREY BECAUSE I HAVE TO ADMIT THIS
POD1000000010_S0000161	I WAS A LITTLE AFRAID TO SIT DOWN WITH SARAH
POD1000000010_S0000165	ONE REALLY PRACTICAL WAY SCARLETT'S CHOOSE LOVE PLAN BUILDS COURAGE IS BY TEACHING KIDS TO STAY CALM
POD1000000010_S0000170	JEN COTTLER AT CELESTE SAYS IF YOU'RE MORE AWARE OF YOUR EMOTIONS YOU'LL ALSO BE MORE AWARE OF EVERYONE ELSE'S
POD1000000010_S0000186	YEAH BEFORE JEN STARTED AT CESSNA WORKSHOP SHE SPENT HER DAYS IN A CLASSROOM
POD1000000010_S0000190	THE PROBLEM JEN FOUND OUT WITH FORCED APOLOGIES AS THAT THEY'RE USUALLY PRETTY WORTHLESS

POD1000000010_S0000196	JEN SAYS YOU CAN ACTUALLY TAKE A MOMENT LIKE THIS
POD1000000010_S0000200	JEN SAYS SESAME STREET HAS IMPROVED OVER TIME IN HOW IT DEPICTS APOLOGIES ON THE SHOW
POD1000000010_S0000202	SO ELMA MIGHT SAY I WAS REALLY WANTING TO PLAY WITH MY SKATEBOARD AND I DIDN'T WANT TO SHARE IT

POD1000000010_S0000228	YOU HURT AMY
POD1000000010_S0000231	TOM ALSO SAYS THAT CHILDREN SHOULD LEARN TO MAKE AN APOLOGY OF ACTION
POD1000000010_S0000236	AND SCARLETT LOUIS SAYS THAT MEANS WHEN PARENTS GREW UP WE NEED TO APOLOGIZE TOO
POD1000000010_S0000240	IF ANYTHING SCARLETT TALKS EVEN MORE ABOUT THE OTHER SIDE OF AN APOLOGY FORGIVENESS
POD1000000010_S0000250	I LOVE THIS TOO BECAUSE SCARLETT IS REALLY FOCUSING ON THE BENEFIT OF LETTING GO OF ANGER
POD1000000010_S0000252	AND IT WAS AT THIS POINT WHERE WE'RE SITTING WITH SCARLETT IN HER KITCHEN HER BACK IS TO A REFRIGERATOR WHICH IS COVERED WITH PHOTOS OF JESSIE AND HER OTHER SON JT AND WE JUST HAD TO ASK
POD1000000010_S0000268	AJA SIMMONS HELPS RUN THE SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL PROGRAMS FOR SCHOOLS IN OAKLAND CALIFORNIA

POD1000000010_S0000281	YEAH PART OF HOW SCARLETT KEEPS GOING SHE TOLD US IS BY CONSTANTLY REMINDING HERSELF EVEN OUT LOUD WHAT SHE'S GRATEFUL FOR

POD1000000010_S0000313	SO TOM SAYS YOU KNOW NOT FOR AN ALLOWANCE BUT JUST TO GIVE THE MESSAGE THAT THIS IS WHAT WE DO TO HELP OUT BECAUSE WE'RE PART OF SOMETHING BIGGER

POD1000000017_S0000019	STEAL AWAY BY ROBERT DUPREE
POD1000000017_S0000031	I'M HEARING THINGS LIKE ROSANA BY TOTO
POD1000000017_S0000041	THERE IS SOMETHING JAZZ LIKE IN THE SYNCOPATED MUSIC OF SOMETHING LIKE STEELY DAN
POD1000000017_S0000043	YOU CAN HEAR IN SOMEBODY LIKE MICHAEL MCDONALD
POD1000000017_S0000049	AND THE SONG IN WHICH I AM HEARING IT THE DEEPEST AND STRONGEST AND MOST POWERFULLY AT LEAST TO ME STANDING IN THAT KITCHEN CHOPPING THOSE VEGETABLES WAS WHEN KENNY LOGANS THIS IS IT
POD1000000017_S0000053	KENNY LOGGINS IS BASICALLY SING WHISPERING THE VERSES OF THIS SONG
POD1000000017_S0000058	AND THEN IN THE PRE COURSE CANNY LOGAN DISAPPEARS AND WHO SHOWS UP MICHAEL MCDONALD
POD1000000017_S0000060	GIVING PENNY LOGUGES PLENTY OF TIME TO GATHER HIMSELF
POD1000000017_S0000066	SCRAPING THE PAN IS THE BLACKEST THING YOU CAN DO AS A SINGER AND HERE'S KENNY LOGGINS AS THIS WHITE ARTIST DOING IT
POD1000000017_S0000078	I'M THINKING ABOUT AMY WHITEHOUSE
POD1000000017_S0000080	I'M THINKING ABOUT ANNA LUX
POD1000000017_S0000082	THINK ABOUT GEORGE MICHAEL
POD1000000017_S0000084	I THINK ABOUT CHRIS DABOLTON TO SPEND MY NIGHTS
POD1000000017_S0000087	AND ONE OF THE MANY PHASES IN WHICH DAVE BOBBY REALLY WANTED TO MAKE R AND B AND SOUL MUSIC
POD1000000017_S0000089	THIS IS THE SOUND NOT JUST OF BLACK AMERICA BUT THE SOUND OF AMERICA IT IS DEEPLY AMERICAN ALMOST ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S SUNG BY BRITISH PEOPLE LIKE DAVID BOWIE AND AMY WINEHOUSE
POD1000000017_S0000103	AND THEN THERE WILL BE TO THE LANDING CORNER YOU HAVE SOMEONE LIKE BILLY MCCRAY
POD1000000017_S0000114	IT'S WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE HEARD PASSED A BLACK PERSON DOING HIS JOB ENTERTAINING HIMSELF DOING THE DUDGERY OF WORK THE WAY A GUY NAMED THOMAS DARTH VADER RICE DID SOMETIME AROUND THE
POD1000000017_S0000116	ONE DAY HE'S TOURING WITH A TROOP IN CINCINNATI OR MAYBE IT WAS PITTSBURGH WE DON'T REALLY KNOW BUT THE MYTH BASICALLY GOES T D RACE HAPPENED UPON AN OLD BLACK MAN CLEANING A HORSE IN A STABLE
POD1000000017_S0000117	THE MAN WAS DOING HIS JOB ON PROPERTY OWNED BY A WHITE MAN NAMED CROW
POD1000000017_S0000122	WHATEVER RICE HERE IS COMING OUT OF THIS MAN'S MOUTH IS CAPTIVATING TO HIM AND WHAT HE SEES IS AN OPPORTUNITY
POD1000000017_S0000133	AND SO WHEN TEDDY RICE HEARS THIS BLACK MAN SINGING THIS SONG AND MOVING HIS BODY IN THIS PARTICULAR WAY DING A LIGHT BULB GOES OFF
POD1000000017_S0000140	COME LISTEN ALL YOU GALS AND BOYS I'M JUST FROM TUCKAHOE I'M GONNA SING A LITTLE SONG MY NAME'S JIM CROW
POD1000000017_S0000142	AND THE LYRICS GIVE THE HORSEMEN A NAME AND THE NAME IS JIM CROW
POD1000000017_S0000146	THIS IS THE FIRST TIME A PAYING AUDIENCE IS BASICALLY ELECTRIFIED BY A WHITE MAN WITH A BLACK FACE THIS IS THE NIGHT THAT JIM CROW WAS ALLEGEDLY INTRODUCED TO AMERICA THIS MASCOT OF AMERICAN RACISM
POD1000000017_S0000148	AND HERE IS THOMAS DARTMOUTH RICE GIVING IT TO THEM THIS IS THE NIGHT THAT AMERICAN POPULAR CULTURE WAS BORN
POD1000000017_S0000151	SO YOU HAVE OTHER MENTORIAL ACTS WHO COME ALONG AND TRY TO DO WHAT THOMAS DARTH VADER IS DOING A SONG AND A DANCE
POD1000000017_S0000175	SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE HAVING THESE DREAMS GO ON TO BECOME PEOPLE LIKE STEPHEN FOSTER
POD1000000017_S0000177	THE MAN WIRELY CREDITED AS BEING THE FATHER OF AMERICAN MUSIC
POD1000000017_S0000197	FEE MILLER AND SCOTT MAN CURT
POD1000000017_S0000210	DAVE GRIFFITHS THE BIRTH OF A NATION FULL OF WHITE MEN VIOLENTLY IN BLACK FACE
POD1000000017_S0000220	JUDY GARLAND PERFORMED IN BLACK FACE
POD1000000017_S0000222	BING CROSBY AND FRED ESTER BOTH PERFORMED IN BLACK FACE
POD1000000017_S0000227	OUT OF THESE RECORDINGS YOU HAVE PEOPLE LIKE MUDDY WATERS
POD1000000017_S0000237	YOU HAVE THE ADVENT OF A PLACE LIKE BLUE NOTE RECORDS WHERE LOTS OF AMAZING JAZZ WAS CREATED AND THEN RELEASED INTO THE WORLD
POD1000000017_S0000239	BOBBY ARMSTRONG
POD1000000017_S0000241	AND DUKE ELLINGTON
POD1000000018_S0000000	WHEN ANDY GRIFFITH PASSED AWAY IN TWENTY TWELVE CNN COVERED HIS DEATH OFTEN ON THE ENTIRE DAY
POD1000000018_S0000003	LAURY KING IS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO CALLED IN TO TALK THAT DAY HE'D HAD ANDY ON HIS VARIOUS SHOWS NUMEROUS TIMES AND HE MENTIONED SOMETHING IN PASSING THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING
POD1000000018_S0000005	WHAT LAURY SAID IS THAT A LAWYER NAMED PERCY FORMAN WAS THE MAN WHO INSPIRED THE CHARACTER MATLOCK
POD1000000018_S0000007	THIS WAS A WEIRD THING FOR ANYONE TO SAY BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE EVEN TODAY BELIEVE THAT CHARACTER TO BE BASED ON A DIFFERENT LAWYER NAMED BOBBY LEE COOK
POD1000000018_S0000009	HOWEVER IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THREE YEARS AFTER LARRY KING SAID SOMETHING THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD ASSUME WAS INCORRECT THE CREATOR OF MATLOCK DID CONFIRM THAT THE CHARACTER WAS BASED ON PERCY FORMAN
POD1000000018_S0000012	PERRY WAS ABLE TO ACHIEVE THIS RECORD BY BEING AN INCREDIBLE LAWYER NO DENYING IT BUT ALSO DUE TO THE TEXAS COURT SYSTEMS PRACTICE OF USING JURIES TO DETERMINE GUILT AS WELL AS SENTENCING IN THE CASE OF A GUILTY VERDICT
POD1000000018_S0000016	PERRY HAD TWELVE AVERAGE CITIZENS FROM THE LOCAL COMMUNITY SITTING RIGHT THERE WAITING TO BE CONVINCED THAT THE VICTIM IN THIS SITUATION WASN'T A VICTIM AT ALL
POD1000000018_S0000019	FORMER CALLED IT MISDEMEANOR MURDER THAT'S WHERE A JURY MIGHT CONVICT YOU OF ENDING ANOTHER PERSON'S LIFE AND SEND YOU ON YOUR WAY WITH THE TYPE OF PUNISHMENT YOU'D RECEIVE FOR A MISDEMEANOR CRIME
POD1000000018_S0000021	PERCY FORMAN HAD SUCH A LONG RUN OF WINS WITH THIS STRATEGY THAT IT'S STILL BEING USED IN TEXAS TODAY PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS SORT OF THING WILL SOMETIMES REFER TO IT AS THE TEXAS DEFENSE
POD1000000018_S0000023	NOW JIM DENNEY WASN'T FROM TEXAS HE WAS FROM TENNESSEE
POD1000000018_S0000025	WHEN A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD JIM DENNEY GOT HIRED TO WORK THE MAIL ROOM OF WSM RADIO'S PARENT COMPANY HE MUST HAVE SEEN IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF HIMSELF
POD1000000018_S0000027	DENNY GOT THIS JOB IN NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN THAT YEAR THE YOUNG RADIO PROGRAM WSM BARN DANCE WAS REFERRED TO AS THE GRAND OLE OPRY FOR THE FIRST TIME ON AIR
POD1000000018_S0000029	EVERY TIME AN ODD JOB CAME UP AT THE OPRY JIM WOULD TAKE IT SO HE COULD HANG OUT BACKSTAGE SEE THE ARTISTS AND SEE HOW THE SHOW WAS MADE
POD1000000018_S0000030	WITHIN TWENTY YEARS DENNY HAD WORKED HIS WAY UP TO DIRECTOR OF THE ARTIST SERVICE BOARD AT WSM WHICH MEANT HE WAS IN CHARGE OF BOOKING THE AXE ON THE OPRY
POD1000000018_S0000032	THERE'S A FEW FUNNY THINGS FROM JIM DENNEY'S TIME AT THE GRAND OLE OPRY LIKE THE ONE ABOUT ELVIS PRESLEY'S BIG DEBUT
POD1000000018_S0000033	ELVIS WAS STILL A TEENAGER WHEN DENNY DID SAM PHILLIPS THE FAVOR OF LETTING ELVIS COME ON THE SHOW TO PLAY HIS NOT COUNTRY ARRANGEMENT OF BLUE MOON OF KENTUCKY
POD1000000018_S0000035	IT DIDN'T GO WELL DENNY IS RUMORED TO HAVE TOLD ELVIS BACKSTAGE YOU DON'T GO INTO NOWHERE SON YOU HAD TO GO BACK TO DRIVE A TRUCK
POD1000000018_S0000037	DENNY'S ALSO THE GUY WHO FIRED HANK WILLIAMS OVER THE TELEPHONE AND THERE'S THE TIME WHEN JIM MADE JOHNNY CASH WAITED OUTSIDE HIS OFFICE FOR TWO HOURS BEFORE LETTING HIM IN TO ASK WHY CASH SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO PLAY ON THE OPRY
POD1000000018_S0000039	CASS MENTIONED THAT HE PRESENTLY HAD A SONG CALLED I WALK THE LINE IN THE TOP TEN
POD1000000018_S0000041	JIM DENNEY WAS WHAT MANY PEOPLE REFERRED TO IN THOSE TIMES AS A HARD MAN TODAY I THINK THEY'D HAVE SOME DIFFERENT WORDS FOR HIM AND THAT'S WHY ERNEST TUBB TRIED TO SHOOT HIM IN
POD1000000018_S0000044	MY NAME IS TYLER MAYHAN CO I'VE HEARD THESE STORIES MY WHOLE LIFE
POD1000000018_S0000047	IT'S SHOCKING TO HEAR ERNEST TOB'S NAME ASSOCIATED WITH ANY KIND OF VIOLENCE WHATSOEVER
POD1000000018_S0000051	CRISP TEXAS IS A GHOST TOWN NOW EARNEST TUB WAS BORN THERE IN NINETEEN FOURTEEN INTO A FAMILY OF SHARECROPPERS LIKE MOST SHARECROPPERS CHILDREN EARNEST GREW UP WORKING ON FARMS ALL OVER THE AREA
POD1000000018_S0000054	LIKE A GREAT NUMBER OF ARTISTS WILL LEARN ABOUT IN FUTURE EPISODES IT WAS ALL OVER FOR A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD EARNEST TUB THE FIRST TIME HE HEARD JIMMY ROGERS SING
POD1000000018_S0000058	HEARING JIMMY ROGERS IS WHAT LED ERNEST TO DECIDE HE SIMPLY HAD TO BECOME A COUNTRY SINGER
POD1000000018_S0000059	IT'S ALSO VERY SPECIFICALLY WHAT CAUSED HIM THREE DECADES LATER TO WANT TO SHOOT A THREE FIFTY SEVEN MAGNUM AT JIM DENNEY
POD1000000018_S0000062	THE DEATH OF HIS IDOL WAS EXTREMELY UPSETTING FOR EARNEST HOWEVER IT ALSO MADE HIM REALIZE THAT HE WAS GOING TO HAVE TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT CHASING HIS DREAMS
POD1000000018_S0000067	HOLDING DOWN THREE JOBS AT ONCE WAS NECESSARY TO SUPPORT HIMSELF AND HIS YOUNG WIFE ELAINE THEY DIDN'T WASTE ANY TIME BEFORE STARTING TO HAVE KIDS EITHER
POD1000000018_S0000069	ERNEST WAS MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK HARD IF IT KEPT HIM MOVING TOWARDS THE LIFE OF HIS HERO JIMMY RODGERS
POD1000000018_S0000070	HE'D HAD THIS SMALL PICTURE OF JIMMY FOR YEARS NOW AND IT WAS IN PRETTY BAD SHAPE SO HE GOT A PHONE BOOK AND LOOKED UP THE NUMBER FOR JIMMY RODGERS WIFE
POD1000000018_S0000071	HE CALLED HER ON THE PHONE TO EXPLAIN THAT HE WAS SUCH A BIG FAN AND TO SEE IF SHE HAPPENED TO HAVE A BIGGER BETTER PHOTO OF JIMMY THAT ERNEST COULD HAVE MAYBE EVEN ONE THAT WAS ORIGINATED
POD1000000018_S0000072	KARRY WAS SUPER NICE AND SHE DID HAVE SUCH A PHOTO THAT ERIN COULD HAVE AND WENT SO FAR AS TO INVITE HIM OUT TO HER HOUSE IN CARRIVILLE TEXAS TO GET THE PICTURE
POD1000000018_S0000073	ERNST DROVE OUT THERE THE NEXT SUNDAY HE WASN'T WORKING TAKING ELANE AND THEIR BABY JUSTIN ON THE TRIP
POD1000000018_S0000075	THEY'D PLANNED TO STAY FOR MAYBE TEN MINUTES AND ENDED UP HANGING OUT FOR OVER TWO HOURS LOOKING AT COSTUMES GUITARS AND PICTURES BROUGHT OUT BY MRS RODGERS HEARING HER STORIES ABOUT HOW HIGH ON THE HAUL THEY'D LIVED MERELY A FEW YEARS EARLIER
POD1000000018_S0000076	ET COULD NEVER HAVE GUESSED WHEN HE WOKE UP THAT MORNING THAT HE'D BE LAYING DOWN TO SLEEP THAT HAVING HELD JIMMY ROGER'S SIGNATURE MARTIN ACOUSTIC GUITAR WITH JIMMY'S NAME INLAID IN PEARL ACROSS THE FRETBOARD AND THE WORD THANKS WRITTEN ON THE BACK UPSIDE DOWN
POD1000000018_S0000080	OKAY NOW ADD THIS ON TOP OF THAT A FEW MONTHS LATER CARRIE RODGERS CALLED ERNEST TO SAY SHE'D LISTENED FOR HIS RADIO SHOW AS HE'D ASKED FOR HER TO DO
POD1000000018_S0000082	ON THE OTHER HAND SHE DIDN'T THINK HE SOUNDED LIKE JIMMY RODGERS WHEN HE SANG WHICH IS BASICALLY THE ONLY THING IN THE WORLD EARNEST HUB WANTED TO DO IN THIS PHASE OF HIS LIFE
POD1000000018_S0000085	ANYWAY SHE STILL HOOKED E T UP WITH ELSIE MCWILLIAMS THE WRITER OF A FEW GREAT JIMMY ROGER SONGS
POD1000000018_S0000086	ERNEST TUBE MADE A COUPLE OF RECORDS THAT DIDN'T SELL VERY WELL DID SOME TOURING AND ENDED UP BACK HOME DOING LOW PAYING RADIO AGAIN AND WORKING TWO OR THREE SIDE JOBS LIKE BEFORE DRIVING AROUND A BEER TRUCK WAS ONE OF THEM
POD1000000018_S0000088	AFTER A WHILE BACK AT HOME ERNEST HAD TO HAVE HIS TONSILS TAKEN OUT HE'D LATER SAY THE DOCTORS TOLD HIM NOT TO SING OR YODLE FOR A WHILE AFTER THE SURGERY BUT HE DIDN'T LISTEN
POD1000000018_S0000093	ERNEST HELD A SELF DEPRECATING SENSE OF HUMOR ABOUT HIS OWN VOICE FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE HE'D LOVED TO SAY THAT NINE OUT OF TEN GUYS SITTING IN BARS AROUND THE COUNTRY COULD SING MUCH BETTER THAN HE COULD
POD1000000018_S0000094	I DON'T KNOW IF HE REALLY BELIEVED THAT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN STRANGE TO ME I THINK GEORGE JONES INDISPUTABLY THE GREATEST COUNTRY SINGER IN HISTORY IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ADD ERNEST TUBBS NEW SINGING STYLE AND ROY ACUFF'S VOICE TOGETHER
POD1000000018_S0000096	YOU JUST HEARD SOME URENEST HERE'S A LITTLE ROY ACUFF FROM
POD1000000018_S0000098	NOW GEORGE JONES WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU HANK WILLIAMS WAS HIS FAVORITE SINGER YOU DON'T GET HANK WITHOUT EARNEST AND ROY I'VE SEEN LEFTA FRAZELL NAMED AS AN INFLUENCE ON
POD1000000018_S0000099	LEFTY BORROWED FROM ERNEST AS WELL HOWEVER YOU WANT TO SAY WE GOT TO GEORGE JONES IT ALWAYS COMES BACK TO ROY ACUFF AND ERNEST TUBB
POD1000000018_S0000100	NOW THE PART OF EARNEST YOU CAN HEAR IN GEORGE IS THE TENDENCY TO HOLD ON TO A NOTE FOR LONGER THAN YOU'D EXPECT PICKING THE MELODY UP AND PUTTING IT BACK DOWN IN WAYS THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT WHEN HEARING THEM SING A SONG FOR THE FIRST TIME
POD1000000018_S0000106	IT'S POSSIBLE EARNEST REALLY DIDN'T LIKE HIS NEW VOICE ABOUT A MILLION PEOPLE DISAGREE WITH HIS OPINION HE HAD THAT TONSELEMI IN NINETEEN THIRTY NINE
POD1000000018_S0000107	IN NINETEEN FORTY HE HAD HIS BIGGEST HIT WALK IN THE FLOOR OVER YOU THIS SONG IS STILL SIMILAR WITH THE NAME ERNEST
POD1000000018_S0000108	IF SOMEONE ONLY KNOWS ONE ERNEST HUBB SONG IT'S USUALLY THIS SONG
POD1000000018_S0000111	THE TEXAS TROPADOR EARNEST HUBBARD
POD1000000018_S0000115	TUPP WOULD STAY WORKING FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE SO MEMBERS OF THE TEXAS TRUBADOURS WOULD BE REPLACED EVERY NOW AND THEN
POD1000000018_S0000116	BUDDY EMMONS JACK GREEN BILLY BURD JEAN ROADS AND CAL SMITH ARE ONLY SOME OF THE NOTABLE PLAYERS WHO JOINED THE BAND ON THEIR WAY UP THE LADDER
POD1000000018_S0000118	THIS WAS THE FIRST WAY EARNEST FOUND TO EXTEND A HELPING HAND TO YOUNGER MUSICIANS LIKE THE HAND CARRY ROGERS HAD HELD OUT TO HIM
POD1000000018_S0000123	AND SO HE STARTED CALLING THEIR NAMES OUT WHEN THEY TOOK A COURSE BUT HE WAS NEVER JEALOUS OF ANYBODY IN HIS BAND OUTSHINING HIM HE DIDN'T YOU KNOW HE DIDN'T MIND THAT AT ALL AS HE PROVED WITH JACK GREEN AND CAL SMITH

POD1000000018_S0000151	KARI LOANED AND EVENTUALLY FLAT OUT GAVE HIM THAT GUITAR OF JIMMY'S WHICH IS WHY YOU'LL FREQUENTLY SEE PICTURES OR VIDEOS OF ERNEST TUB PLAYING A GUITAR THAT SAYS JIMMY RODGERS ON IT

POD1000000018_S0000157	DENNY WAS A POWERFUL MAN IN NASHVILLE AND HE ACTED LIKE HE KNEW IT
POD1000000018_S0000158	WHERE ERNEST TUBE BUILT A REPUTATION FOR HELPING YOUNG MUSICIANS JIM DENNEY HAD A REPUTATION FOR ACTING LIKE A DICK

POD1000000018_S0000162	JIM DUNNEY MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN A DICK HE COULD HAVE SIMPLY BEEN A BUSINESSMAN WHO PAID MORE ATTENTION TO THE BOTTOM LINE THAN HOW MANY FRIENDS HE HAD
POD1000000018_S0000163	DENNY'S THE GUY WHO HAD TO BE CONVINCED TO LET HANK SENIOR ONTO THE OPRY AND HE'S THE GUY WHO CALLED HANK TO FIRE HIM OVER THE TELEPHONE BUT ERNEST TUBB WAS STANDING IN DENNY'S OFFICE WHEN THAT PHONE CALL WAS MADE
POD1000000018_S0000164	HE SAID HE SAW TEARS IN JIM'S EYES

POD1000000018_S0000166	THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED HANK WILLIAMS DIED FOUR MONTHS AFTER BEING DISMISSED FROM THE OPRY IT'S TRAGIC BUT YOU CAN SEE HOW JIM DENNEY THOUGHT HE WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING IN THAT SITUATION

POD1000000018_S0000184	LONG STORY SHORT IN NINETEEN FIFTY SIX WSM FIRED JIM DENNEY OVER HIS CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
POD1000000018_S0000186	HE STARTED A BOOKING AGENCY AND SIGNED MOST OF THE OPRY ARTISTS SOME OF WHOM HAD RESIGNED WHEN DENNY WAS FIRED THEN DENNY CONTACTED THE PHILLIP MORRIS TOBACCO COMPANY
POD1000000018_S0000188	SO WHEN JIM DENNEY CALLED WITH A CHANCE FOR THEM TO GET THEIR PRODUCT ASSOCIATED WITH ALL THOSE ACTS PHILIP MORRIS WROTE A CHECK BIG ENOUGH TO FUND THE BIGGEST COUNTRY MUSIC PACKAGE TOUR ANYONE HAD EVER SEEN
POD1000000018_S0000191	IT LOOKED AS THOUGH EVERYONE WAS GETTING WHAT THEY WANTED UNTIL THE PHILIP MOORE COUNTRY MUSIC SHOW BOOKED TO STOP IN MERRIAM MISSOURI ON THE SAME WEEK AS THE FIFTH ANNUAL JIMMY ROGERS MEMORIAL FESTIVAL

POD1000000018_S0000210	MEANWHILE WHEN JIM DENNEY HAD HUNG UP THE PHONE HE SIMPLY TOOK IT BACK OFF THE HOOK AGAIN SO EARNEST COULDN'T CALL HIM ANYMORE AND THEN WENT BACK TO SLEEP
POD1000000018_S0000212	SO ERNEST HUB IS DRUNK OFF HIS ASS WITH A LOADED GUN WHEN HE STUMBLES INTO THE LOBBY OF THE NATIONAL LIFE BUILDING WHERE WSM WAS LOCATED
POD1000000018_S0000217	BILL WILLIAMS THE NEWS DIRECTOR AT WSM SAYS HE WAS WALKING INTO WORK WHEN A GUN SHOT RANG OUT IN THE LOBBY AND A BULLET WENT OVER HIS HEAD INTO THE WALL

POD1000000018_S0000222	EITHER WAY ERNEST SETTLED DOWN AFTER THINKING HE'D SHOT AN INNOCENT PERSON BILL WILLIAMS CALLED HIS BOSS JACK THE WHIT TO TELL HIM WHAT HAPPENED JACK TOLD BILL TO TAKE ERNEST HOME
POD1000000018_S0000225	ERNEST HUB WENT TO JAIL FOR DRUNKEN DISORDERLY PLUS CARRYING THE WEAPON
POD1000000018_S0000227	SO EARNEST BOUGHT CIGARETTES FOR ALL THE OTHER INMATES AND SANG SONGS WITH THEM WHILE BILL WILLIAMS WAITED TO TAKE HIM HOME
POD1000000018_S0000231	JIM DENNEY'S NAME WAS KEPT OUT OF THE PAPERS THOUGH EVERYONE IN THE BUSINESS COULD READ BETWEEN THE LINES AND SEE WHO ERNEST HAD WANTED TO SHOOT
POD1000000018_S0000233	THE INCIDENT SEEMS TO HAVE HAD NO EFFECT ON ERNEST HUBBS CAREER WHATSOEVER APPARENTLY IF ALL E T WAS TRYING TO DO WAS PUT A BULLET IN JIM DENNEY THEN THAT WAS FINE
POD1000000018_S0000236	IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR HIS LUNGS KILLED HIM JUST LIKE HIS HERO JIMMY RODGERS
POD1000000018_S0000238	THE MIDNIGHT JAMBOREE STILL AIRES EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT AND YOU CAN STILL BUY MUSIC FROM EARNEST HUB'S RECORD SHOP OR ONLINE AT ET RECORDS SHOP DOT COM

POD1000000018_S0000252	OKAY FIRST OF ALL IF I DIDN'T MAKE IT CLEAR IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO OVERSTATE EARNEST TUBBS IMPORTANCE TO COUNTRY MUSIC
POD1000000018_S0000254	IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT HONKY TONK AND IT HAPPENED AFTER EARNEST TUB IT WAS INFLUENCED BY EARNEST TUB BEFORE I GET TO THE STORY IN THE EPISODE I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS ONE OTHER THING
POD1000000018_S0000255	IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES CLYDE MOODY TRIED TO START AN ALTERNATIVE ASSOCIATION TO THE COUNTRY MUSIC HALL OF FAME CALLED THE COUNTRY MUSIC PIONEER ASSOCIATION
POD1000000018_S0000256	THE CMPA HAD A TRASHY NEWSPAPER THAT CLIFTON ESSENTIALLY USED TO RANT AGAINST THE INDUSTRY AND PRINT WHATEVER SHITTY RUMORS PEOPLE SENT IN
POD1000000018_S0000257	AMONG THESE RUMORS WAS ONE THAT ERNEST TUBE DIED BROKE AND ALONE IN A CHEAP DOWNTOWN MOTEL SHUNNED BY THE COUNTRY MUSIC WORLD HE'D DONE SO MUCH TO HELP
POD1000000018_S0000259	CHARLIE LUVIN EVEN HAS IT IN HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY WHICH ISN'T THE ONLY THING CHARLIE GOT WRONG IN THAT BOOK BUT I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT ANOTHER TIME
POD1000000018_S0000260	FIRST OF ALL THE SOURCE WAS ERNEST TUBBS ESTRANGED WIFE NEXT ERNEST DIED OWNING SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE ERNEST TUBB RECORD SHOP WHICH HAD MULTIPLE LOCATIONS RUNNING AND WAS VERY PROFITABLE AT THAT TIME HE WAS NOT A BROKE MAN
POD1000000018_S0000262	I BELIEVE ERNEST CHOSE TO TURN VISITORS AWAY BECAUSE HE WAS WASTING AWAY OF EMPHYSEMA AND DIDN'T WANT ANYONE WHO LOVED HIM TO HAVE THAT AS THEIR LAST MEMORY OF HIM
POD1000000018_S0000265	AND I THINK JUSTIN SAID THAT PEOPLE WOULD GO WOULD TRY TO SEE ERNEST AND HE WOULD TELL JUSTIN TO TELL THEM THANK YOU BUT HE'D RATHER NOT HAVE THE COMPANY
POD1000000018_S0000266	SO YOU KNOW I MEAN THE END I I DON'T THINK THAT ERNEST TUBB DIED YOU KNOW IN A SAD STATE OF AFFAIRS I THINK THAT HE DID
POD1000000018_S0000268	I THINK HE DID A LOT FOR COUNTRY MUSIC AND I THINK HE WENT OUT THE WAY THAT HE WANTED TO GO IT SEEMS LIKE TO ME OKAY BACK TO ERNEST HUB AND JIM DENNY

POD1000000022_S0000012	AND AT THE TIME OF SARTARE FOR OVER THREE HUNDRED YEARS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN POINTING OUT HOW MANY OF THE WAYS WE LOOK AT THINGS IN THE WESTERN WORLD ARE LARGELY DERIVATIVE FROM THE WAY CHRISTIANITY DESCRIBES BEING A HUMAN BEING
POD1000000022_S0000023	THAT A REASONABLE EXPECTATION TO HAVE WHEN NAVIGATING YOUR LIFE IS THAT ONE DAY YOU'RE GOING TO WAKE UP AND THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME EVENT SOME MIRACLE THAT YOU WITNESS SOME TRANSCENDENT MOMENT WHERE YOU REALIZE THE DIVINITY OF JESUS
POD1000000022_S0000030	MAYBE FOR SOME OF YOU OUT THERE THERE'S ONLY ONE OTHER PERSON IN THIS ENTIRE WORLD THAT HAS FULL ACCESS TO YOUR TRUE SELF HIDDEN DEEP WITHIN YOU BUT SARTA WOULD SAY IS THIS REALLY HOW THE SELF WORKS
POD1000000022_S0000031	IS THE SELF REALLY LIKE THE CHRISTIAN SOUL HIDDEN SOMEWHERE DEEP WITHIN YOU THAT ONLY YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THAT CARTER WOULD SAY IT VERY WELL MAY BE THAT YOU PUT ON A MASK WHEN YOU GO OUT IN PUBLIC FOR THE SAKE OF PRAGMATISM AND IT VERY WELL MAY BE THAT YOU'VE REFLECTED ON YOURSELF
POD1000000022_S0000033	THIS CONCEPT IS A COMMON ONE IN EXISTENTIALISM IT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF THE MAIN THEMES IN DOSTOEVSKY'S BOOK CRIME AND PUNISHMENTS THE IDEA THAT YOU KNOW WE OFTEN THINK WE KNOW A LOT MORE ABOUT OURSELVES WHEN WE ACTUALLY DO IN PRACTICE TWO EXAMPLES OF THIS
POD1000000022_S0000036	THAT GUY NOW THIS MAN BELIEVES BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT THAT HE IS NAPOLEON IF YOU SAT HIM DOWN AND YOU ASKED HIM CANDIDLY NO BUT WHO ARE YOU REALLY DEEP DOWN INSIDE HE WOULD SAY I'M NAPOLEON

POD1000000022_S0000044	SARTA SAYS THAT WHEN YOU TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THE SELF IT'S NOT A SOUL IT'S NOT A PERSONALITY HIDDEN DEEP WITHIN YOU WHAT WE'RE REFERENCING WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE SELF TURNS OUT TO BE MUCH MORE COMPLEX THAN THAT WITH MANY MORE MOVING PARTS
POD1000000022_S0000045	AND I THINK A GOOD PLACE TO BEGIN IF WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND SARAH'S VIEWS ON WHAT THE SELF REALLY IS IS TO TALK ABOUT TWO FOUNDATIONAL ASPECTS OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A HUMAN BEING THAT SARAH SEEM TO BE CONSTANTLY INTERTWINED AND DEPENDENT UPON EACH OTHER WHAT HE CALLS OUR FACTICITY
POD1000000022_S0000048	FULLY AFFIRMATIVE AND BEING FOR ITSELF AS BEING CONSCIOUSNESS OR THE SOURCE OF ALL OBLIGATION BUT ONE DAY WHEN SARAH TRYING TO MEET HIS MONTHLY QUOTA FOR OBSCURE SOUNDING PHILOSOPHICAL DESCRIPTIONS THE WAY HE DESCRIBES A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO ONTOLOGICAL CATEGORIES IS THAT BEING IN ITSELF
POD1000000022_S0000049	IS WHAT IT IS AND BEING FOR ITSELF QUOTE IS WHAT IT IS NOT WELL AS WEIRD AS THAT SOUNDS IN A VACUUM AFTER LISTENING TO THE LAST EPISODE WE ALL KNOW WHAT HE MEANS WHEN HE SAYS IT BUT THEN SCHOLAR POINTS OUT SOMETHING VERY MYSTERIOUS A VERY STRANGE COINCIDENCE
POD1000000022_S0000050	WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO ONTOLOGICAL CATEGORIES TWO THINGS THAT ARE EASY TO WRITE OFF IS JUST THESE MEANINGLESS ABSTRACT CONCEPTS THAT START TO COOK UP ONE DAY WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW BEING IN ITSELF AND BEING FOR ITSELF RELATE TO EACH OTHER
POD1000000022_S0000051	SARAH NOTICES THERE SEEMS TO BE A SIMILAR SORT OF RELATIONSHIP AT THE FOUNDATION OF WHO WE ARE AS PEOPLE SEE BECAUSE ON ONE HAND ALL OF US HAVE OUR FACTICITY AND FACTICITY IS KIND OF LIKE BEING IN ITSELF IT'S THE FULLY AFFIRMATIVE SET OF FACTS THAT ARE TRUE ABOUT US
POD1000000022_S0000053	I'M SCARED OF SPIDERS THINGS LIKE THAT RIGHT IN OTHER WORDS STATEMENTS OF FACTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY TRUE ABOUT US THAT'S WHAT MAKES UP OUR FACTICITY BUT WHAT SARTA WOULD WANT US TO CONSIDER IS THAT WHILE THESE KINDS OF STATEMENTS ARE NO DOUBT USEFUL WHEN IT COMES TO DESCRIBING CERTAIN PIECES OF WHO I AM
POD1000000022_S0000058	YOU CAN START TO HEAR THE WEIRD START YOUR DESCRIPTION CREEPING IN THERE JUST LIKE BEING IN ITSELF IS WHAT IT IS AND BEING FOR ITSELF IS WHAT IT IS NOT IN A SENSE I AM WHAT I AM I HAVE A FACTICITY BUT I ALSO AM NOT YET
POD1000000022_S0000066	WHEN SARTRE TALKS ABOUT RADICAL FREEDOM WHEN ANY OF US TALK ABOUT BEING INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE FREE TO ACT AS THEY CHOOSE WE'RE NEVER TALKING ABOUT TOTAL FREEDOM RIGHT IT'S ALWAYS FREEDOM WITHIN CERTAIN LIMITATIONS
POD1000000022_S0000072	BUT YEAH ULTIMATELY THE POINT SARAH IS MAKING HERE WITH THE CONCEPTS OF FACTICITY AND TRANSCENDENCE IS NOT ONLY TO STOP THINKING ABOUT YOURSELF AS THOUGH IT'S THIS ARTIFACT HIDDEN DEEP WITHIN YOU INSIDE OF A VAULT BUT ALSO STOP THINKING ABOUT WHO YOU ARE AS THOUGH IT'S THIS STATIC
POD1000000022_S0000075	UNLESS IF YOU'RE DEAD YOU'VE NEVER ARRIVED AT A DESTINATION AS A HUMAN BEING NOW AT FIRST GLANCE IT MAY SEEM LIKE SARAH'S WRITING A SELF HELP BOOK NO NO SINGLE FACT ABOUT YOU SUMS UP WHO YOU ARE RELEASE YOUR INNER TRANSCENDENCE NO
POD1000000022_S0000076	NO LIKE WE TOUCHED DOWN LAST TIME SARAH THINKS THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE TRULY FACED WITH THE NUMBER OF THESE POSSIBILITIES THEY'RE FREE TO CHOOSE FROM MOST OF THE TIME THEY DON'T GET EXCITED THEY'RE HORRIFIED BY IT IN FACT MOST OF THE TIME ONCE PEOPLE REALIZE THIS STUFF
POD1000000022_S0000077	SARAH THINKS THAT THE SECRET COVET DESIRE OF EVERYONE WHETHER THEY REALIZE IT OR NOT IS TO ESCAPE THIS DUALITY IT'S TO TURN THEMSELVES INTO EITHER PURE FACTICITY OR PURE TRANSCENDENCE OR AS SARAH SAYS WE ALL SECRETLY WANT TO BECOME GOD
POD1000000022_S0000080	GOD IS PURE AS HE IS PURE FACTICITY BUT ON THE OTHER HAND GOD IS ALL POWERFUL AND CAPABLE OF BRINGING ABOUT ANY POSSIBILITY HE WANTS IN ANOTHER WORD PURE TRANSCENDENCE CARTER WOULD SAY THIS IS NO COINCIDENCE
POD1000000022_S0000083	OR PURE TRANSCENDENCE LIKE GOD IS WHAT SARTA CALLS BAD FAITH LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE MOST FAMOUS EXAMPLE OF BAD FAITH THAT SARTA LAYS OUT AND BECAUSE WE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT IT IN THE OTHER EPISODE I'LL KEEP IT BRIEF
POD1000000022_S0000084	SARAH TALKS ABOUT SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF A CAFE IN PARIS WATCHING A WAITER AS HE DOES HIS JOB NOW YOU CAN IMAGINE A WAITER IN THE NINETEEN FORTYS RIGHT DRESSED UP IN HIS LITTLE OUTFIT VERY UPRIGHT GOOD POSTURE VERY PROPER
POD1000000022_S0000085	HE HOLDS THE TRAY IN A PARTICULAR WAY HE WALKS AND CHANGES DIRECTION IN A VERY MILITARISTIC PARTICULAR WAY LIKE A GOOD WAITER DOES SARGE CAN'T HELP BUT POINT OUT THAT THIS GUY DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A SELF WITH FACTICITY AND TRANSCENDENCE IN THIS MOMENT
POD1000000022_S0000087	GO TO MOST RESTAURANTS AND YOU CAN FIND SOME MODERN VERSION OF WHAT SARAH'S TALKING ABOUT HERE I MEAN THERE'S SO MANY SERVERS OUT THERE THAT HAVE FALLEN INTO BAD FAITH AND ARE JUST SORT OF PLAYING THE ROLE OF THE SAME PERSON IT SEEMS TO BE A MODERN ARCHETYPE OF WHAT IT IS TO BE A SERVER THEY ALL SAY THE SAME STUFF
POD1000000022_S0000088	HI I'M JOHN I'M GOING TO BE TAKING CARE OF YOU TODAY CAN GET YOU GUYS STARTED WITH A BASKET OF SHRimp OR SOME DRINKS OR SOMETHING BUT IT'S AT EVERY STAGE OF THE MEAL HOW'S EVERYTHING TASTED FOR YOU GUYS YOU ALL SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT NOW THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO RUSH I'M GOING TO LEAVE THE CHECK HERE
POD1000000022_S0000090	ASK YOURSELF IS THIS THE WAY THIS GUY TALKS TO HIS MOM IS THIS THE WAY HE TALKS TO HIS BEST FRIENDS NO HE'S FALLEN INTO BAD FAITH AND IS JUST PLAYING THE PART OF A SERVER NOW THE POINT STARTERS MAKING IS NOT THAT WAITERS NEED TO BE MORE CREATIVE IT'S NOT ABOUT WAITERS
POD1000000022_S0000091	SARAH THINKS THAT AS HUMAN BEINGS WE HAVE A TENDENCY TO GRAVITATE TOWARDS THIS TRAP IN ALL ASPECTS OF OUR LIFE WE MAKE PROCLAMATIONS ABOUT WHAT WE ARE ALL THE TIME I AM A STAY AT HOME MOM THAT'S MY IDENTITY
POD1000000022_S0000094	AND WE USE BAD FAITH TO QUELL THIS FEELING OF NOSTALGIA WE'RE CONSTANTLY DOING THIS WITH OURSELVES NOW IF ALL YOU EVER READ WITH SARAH'S BEING IN NOTHINGNESS YOU MIGHT GET THE READ FROM THE BOOK THAT THIS TENDENCY WE HAVE TO GRAVITATE TOWARDS BAD FAITH
POD1000000022_S0000096	BUT IN ONE OF THE FOOTNOTES OF BEING IN NOTHINGNESS SARAH ALLUDES TO A WAY OUT OF ALL OF IT AND PERHAPS TO AN ETHICS THAT HE'D WRITE LATER ON IN HIS LIFE WELL HE NEVER WRITES AN ETHICS UM AND IT MAY BE BECAUSE YOU KNOW HIS LIFELONG PARTNER
POD1000000022_S0000097	AND FELLOW EXISTENTIALISTS SIMONE DE BOER PRODUCES WHAT MANY CONSIDER TO BE THE GREATEST EXISTENTIALIST APPROACH TO ETHICS CALLED THE ETHICS OF AMBIGUITY NEXT EPISODE IS PART TWO ON SIMONE DE BOER WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ALL ABOUT IT UM BUT ENOUGH OF BAD FAITH LET'S GET BACK TO ANSWERING THIS QUESTION WHO AM I
POD1000000022_S0000100	SARTRE WOULD SAY YOU DON'T HAVE SOME PRIVILEGED VIP ACCESS TO THE FACTS THAT ARE TRUE ABOUT YOU AND THE POSSIBILITIES THAT YOU HAVE I MEAN HYPOTHETICALLY ANY OTHER PERSON IF THEY WERE DILIGENT ENOUGH HAS ACCESS TO YOUR FACTICITY AND TRANSCENDENCE
POD1000000022_S0000101	IN FACT JUST LIKE THE GUY THAT TELLS HIMSELF THAT HE'S NEAPOLITAN SOMETIMES OTHER PEOPLE ARE BETTER AT TELLING US WHO WE ARE THAN WE ARE BUT HOW'S THIS POSSIBLE THE REASON IT'S POSSIBLE IS BECAUSE THE SELF IS NOT THE CHRISTIAN SOUL TO SARAH
POD1000000022_S0000104	NO WE TELL OURSELVES STORIES ALL THE TIME AND WHAT FOLLOWS FROM THIS IS THAT THE TRUE MEASURE OF YOUR VALUES THE TRUE MEASURE OF WHO YOU ARE IS WHAT YOU ACTUALLY DO IT'S THE COLLECTION OF WHAT YOU'VE ACTUALLY DONE THUS FAR IN YOUR LIFE AND
POD1000000022_S0000107	NOTHINGNESS THAT SARAH LAYS OUT HIS THIRD ONTOLOGICAL CATEGORY WHAT HE CALLS BEING FOR OTHERS LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT HE MEANS SARAH WOULD SAY THAT AN INTRINSIC PART OF WHAT IT IS TO BE YOU IS EXISTING ALONGSIDE OTHER PEOPLE AND ALL THE CONSEQUENCES THAT COME ALONG WITH THAT
POD1000000022_S0000108	THIS IS SARAH'S CONCEPT OF BEING FOR OTHERS NOW HOW DOES BEING FOR OTHERS AFFECT MY ANSWER TO THE QUESTION WHO AM I WELL AGAIN THIS CONCEPT OF THE SELF IS OUTSIDE OF US IT'S AN ABSTRACTION
POD1000000022_S0000109	AND WHAT SARAH POINTS OUT IS THAT THERE ARE MANY ASPECTS ABOUT WHO WE ARE THAT ARE GIVEN TO US BY OTHER PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE WHETHER WE'RE TRUSTWORTHY OR NOT WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE A TRUSTWORTHY PERSON IS AN ASPECT OF WHO YOU ARE THAT'S MEDIATED BY OTHER PEOPLE
POD1000000022_S0000111	AND HOW OTHER PEOPLE VIEW US SEEM TO BE CONNECTED TO SARTA BUT THE FLIP SIDE OF IT BEING THAT INTERCONNECTED IS THAT IT LEAVES US AND WHAT HE DESCRIBES AS A PERPETUAL STATE OF BEING JUDGED BY THE PEOPLE AROUND US
POD1000000022_S0000114	YOU WILL HINTSFORTH BE KNOWN AS THE WEIRD SHOES GUY IN THAT PERSON'S MIND THIS IS CONSTANTLY GOING ON BUT SARAH'S NOT SAYING IT'S ALWAYS BAD THAT BEING AROUND OTHER PEOPLE IS SOME PARANOID EVERYBODY'S THINKING BAD THINGS ABOUT ME ALL THE TIME THING
POD1000000022_S0000115	PEOPLE VERY WELL MAY BE THINKING REALLY GOOD THINGS ABOUT YOU ALL THE TIME THE POINT THAT SARAH WANTS TO MAKE IS THAT THIS WHOLE DYNAMIC THIS DYNAMIC OF OTHER PEOPLE SEEING YOU PUTTING YOU ON TRIAL AND TURNING YOU INTO PURE FACTICITY IN THEIR MINDS THIS IS GOING ON ALL THE TIME
POD1000000022_S0000121	IT MAY SEEM TO US LIKE WE HAVE A SORT OF SPECIAL ACCESS TO KNOWING WHO WE ARE AND THAT WE CHOOSE TO SHARE OURSELVES WITH ONLY OUR CLOSEST FRIENDS WE TRUST DEARLY BUT SARTRE WOULD SAY THAT THE REASON IT SEEMS THAT WAY IS BECAUSE WHAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE IS A NARRATIVE ABOUT YOURSELF
POD1000000022_S0000124	IS BECAUSE THAT'S THE VERY CRITERIA WE ALL USE TO CHOOSE WHO OUR FRIENDS ARE GOING TO BE IS WHETHER OR NOT THEY REINFORCE THIS PICTURE THAT WE HAVE OF OURSELVES THAT'S WHAT WE LIKE ABOUT OUR FRIENDS TO SARTA
POD1000000022_S0000125	FOR EXAMPLE IF A BIG PART OF THE WAY THAT YOU VIEW YOURSELF AND YOUR IDENTITY IS THAT YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF TO BE A SMART PERSON SARAH WOULD PREDICT THAT MOST OF YOUR FRIENDS ARE GOING TO BE PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT SO SMART THAT TELL YOU YOU'RE SMART ALL THE TIME
POD1000000022_S0000126	OR PEOPLE THAT ASK YOU A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT YOU THEN ANSWER MAKING YOU FEEL SMART OR OTHER SMART PEOPLE THAT COMMEND YOU ON BEING SMART LIKE THEM TO SARTA WE CHOOSE OUR FRIENDS BECAUSE THEY REINFORCE THE WAY THAT WE VIEW OURSELVES
POD1000000022_S0000128	AND OF COURSE IT'S GOING TO FEEL VALIDATING OF COURSE IT WOULD SEEM THAT YOU KNOW BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE WHO YOU ARE BUT AGAIN SARA WOULD SAY THAT THE TRUE MEASURE OF YOUR VALUES THE TRUE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION WHO ARE YOU

POD1000000027_S0000115	AND THE RANGE ROVER AND THE TWO BENTLEYS SHELLY ALSO FOUND OUT THAT DONALD HAD BOUGHT V A ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR DUPLEX
POD1000000027_S0000117	IT WAS THAT ANGER THAT SHELLY BROUGHT TO NEIMAN MARCUS WITH HER RETURNS ON THE FAITHFUL DAY THAT SHE ENCOUNTERED DONALD AND VI IT WASN'T THE FIRST TIME THE TWO WOMEN HAD RUN INTO EACH OTHER OR ARGUED BUT THIS TIME SHELLY DECIDED SHE'D HAD ENOUGH
POD1000000027_S0000119	ON MARCH SEVENTH TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN SHELLY STERLING FILED A LAWSUIT IN CALIFORNIA SUPERIOR COURT AGAINST VESTIVANO SEEKING THE RETURN OF ALL THOSE GIFTS FROM DONALD
POD1000000027_S0000121	DONALD AND SHELLY STERLING WERE WORTH MULTIPLE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND HAD DONE WHAT THE ULTRA RICH DO PUT ALL THEIR MONEY AND PROPERTY INTO A JOINT TRUST
POD1000000027_S0000122	EVERY DIME THAT THE STERLING SPENT COST EACH OF THEM A NICKEL THEREFORE SHELLY ARGUED THE MONEY THAT DONALD USED TO PAY FOR THE GIFTS WAS JUST AS MUCH HERS AS IT WAS
POD1000000027_S0000123	SO SHE TURNED TO THE COURTS THAT SOUNDS A LITTLE EXTREME WELL YOU DON'T KNOW THE STERLINGS CALLING A LAWYER HOW THEY GET OUT OF BED IN THE MORNING

POD1000000027_S0000128	SWEETIE I'M SORRY
POD1000000027_S0000130	AND ACCORDING TO V AND HER LAWYER DONALD WAS AWARE SHE WAS MAKING THE TAPES
POD1000000027_S0000135	SHE'D RECORDED HUNDREDS OF CONVERSATIONS OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS A LOT OF THE RECORDINGS WERE MUNDANE BORING EVEN BUT SOME OF THE RECORDINGS WERE ARGUMENTS AND CAPTURED DECIDED ADONDELF THAT HE WOULD NEVER WANT HIS WIFE OR ANYONE ELSE TO HEAR

YOU1000000020_S0000219	AND THEN IN GAME TWO JACOB WAS ABLE TO SURVIVE DESPITE THE FACT THAT YELLER REARED AN ANGER OF THE GODS THAT DESTROYED ALL OF JACOB'S CREATURE

YOU1000000020_S0000254	ONE INVITATIONAL ENRICHMENT I'M HERE WITH OUR CHAMPION JACOB WILSON CONGRATULATIONS MAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR A HANDSHAKE A LITTLE BIT OF HARDWARE YOU'RE NO STRANGER TO THIS
YOU1000000023_S0000002	FIRE EMBLEM IS TURNING THIRTY NEXT YEAR AND WITH SIXTEEN MAIN GAMES AND A FEW SPINOFFS IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT IT IS GROWN INTO SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY THE GAMES ARE PACKED WITH DEEP STORYLINES AND MEMORABLE CHARACTERS LIKE MARTH
YOU1000000023_S0000003	THAT'S NOT MARTH MARTH THAT'S WHICH ONE IS MARTH
YOU1000000023_S0000005	MARTHA
YOU1000000023_S0000022	THAT WAY THE AUDIENCE COULD BE LIKE AH THAT DUDE WEARING A TYPE FITTING SUIT WITH A BUNCH OF WEIRD PATCHES THAT MUST BE ARLAKINA THE SERVANT CLOUD SOMETIMES TO TWO MASTERS THIS BROUGHT THE AUDIENCE IN IMMEDIATELY THEY KNEW WHAT THAT CHARACTER WAS ABOUT WITHOUT ANY EXPOSITION
YOU1000000023_S0000027	CAINE AND ABLE ARE BATTLE BROS THEY FIGHT TOGETHER BUT NOT IN THE BIBLICAL SENSE BOARD AND COURSES ARE SIMILAR EXCEPT THEY'RE USUALLY AXE FIGHTERS PEGASUS SISTERS ARE A TRIO OF FLYING HORSES LADIES
YOU1000000023_S0000028	YOU CAN'T SPLIT THESE ARCHETYPES UP INTO THEIR SOLO CHARACTERS BECAUSE THEIR BOND IS WHAT DEFINES THEM YOU CAN'T HAVE A WALAWIJI WITHOUT A LOUIJI AND IN THE SAME WAY YOU CAN'T HAVE A BOARD WITHOUT A CORD WHICH IS MY FAVORITE DR SUSUBA
YOU1000000023_S0000029	JAGANS ARE MENTORS THAT ARE STRONG AT THE BEGINNING AND THEN YOU'LL QUICKLY OUTPACE THEM AND IT'S KIND OF SAD LIKE THE FIRST TIME YOU BEAT YOUR DAD IN A BASKETBALL GAME OH PHASES ARE SIMILAR TO JAGANS EXCEPT THEY'LL KEEP DUNKING ON YOU TILL YOU'RE DEAD
YOU1000000023_S0000030	WENDELLS ARE MENTORS BUT FOR MAGIC GOTOS ARE MENTORS BUT ONLY THE LAST HALF OF THE GAME BAYWOLVES ARE MERCENARIES THAT YOU HAVE TO PAY ACTUAL IN GAME CURRENCY TO RECRUIT AND OGAS ARE MERCENARIES THAT USUALLY DECIDE TO JOIN YOU OUT OF THEIR OWN VOLITION
YOU1000000023_S0000034	YOU CAN'T GET THE OTHER KIND OF LIKE IF TWO OF YOUR FRIENDS START DATING AND THEN HAVE A REALLY MESSY BREAKUP CORNELIA'S ARE USUALLY THE PARENTAL FIGURE TO THE MAIN CHARACTER AND THEY HAVE THIS NASTY HABIT OF GETTING AXED SUPER EARLY ON IN THE GAME
YOU1000000023_S0000035	IT'S KIND OF LIKE FIRE EMBLEM DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE INTERESTING CHARACTERS WITHOUT MAKING THEM SUFFER TRAUMATIC PARENTAL DEATH
YOU1000000023_S0000049	BUT BEFORE I GET THERE I JUST WANT TO COMMEND FIRE EMBLEM FOR HAVING FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY SIX PLAYABLE CHARACTERS AND ONLY REPEATING THREE NAMES WHEN I WAS HIRED FOR MY FIRST JOB AT A CLIMBING GYM I WAS ONE OF FIVE EMPLOYEES NAMED BRIAN
YOU1000000023_S0000054	THAT TOOK LIKE THIRTY MINUTES BUT LET'S BEGIN THE HONORABLE NIGHT LIKE FIONA WHO CARES PASSIONATELY ABOUT HER PEOPLE AND WILL ALWAYS OPPOSE CRIME TO CIVILIANS
YOU1000000023_S0000055	WHICH IS WAY BETTER THAN THE LOYAL NIGHT LIKE TRUDE WHO ONLY IS LOYAL TO PERN AND WILL DO LITERALLY ANYTHING FOR HIM EVEN THOUGH PERN IS A BAD DUDE BUT I'LL GET TO THAT LATER
YOU1000000023_S0000059	BUT THAT'S NOT MY FAULT SUPER SMASH SHOULD HAVE INCLUDED MORE MAGIC BABIES ARROGANCE HOT HEADS AND EDGE LORDS ALL HAVE A MEAN SIDE BUT ARROGANCE LIKE VIKI JUST THINK THEY'RE THE BEST HOT HEADS LIKE CASPAR WANT TO FIGHT ANYTHING THAT MOVES
YOU1000000023_S0000060	AND EDGARS LIKE NIELS RETWEET JOKER ACCOUNTS UNIRONICALLY A LOT OF THESE CHARACTERS HAVE ROUGH CHILDHOODS BUT THEN TURN OUT CHEERFUL DESPITE THAT AND THEN THERE'S THE INFERIORITY COMPLEX ARCHETYPE WHICH I COULD HAVE JUST CALLED THE MAJORITY OF CHILDREN IN FIRE EMBLEM FATES
YOU1000000023_S0000061	PERFECTIONISTS MISCHIEF MAKERS AND FLIRTS ARE ALL HIGHLY MOTIVATED BUT SUBAKI IS MOTIVATED TO MEET HIGH EXPECTATIONS CLAUD IS MOTIVATED TO MAKE INTRICATE SCHEMES AND SILVANE IS MOTIVATED TO BE A FUCK BOY
YOU1000000023_S0000062	BUZZ KILLS ARE JUST CHARACTERS THAT AREN'T VERY FUN TO TALK TO AND FIRE EMBLEM I WILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU FOR NAMING AN UNEMOTIONAL UBER RELIGIOUS DEADBEAT DAD GILBERT IT ALSO DOESN'T HELP THAT I LOOK LIKE HANAMIN LIGHT
YOU1000000023_S0000064	OH GOD AM I A BUZZKILL A LOT OF THESE ARCHETYPES ARE BASED AROUND ONE SINGULAR PERSONALITY TRAIT SCARLETT STRAIGHTFORWARD VALLAR'S CHILL LYNX'S LAZY PETRA'S SWEETIE AND RANDOLPH IS A FURRY
YOU1000000023_S0000066	CHILD SOLDIER KAREN IS CANONICALLY FOURTEEN YEARS OLD
YOU1000000023_S0000069	MANUELA IS CONSTANTLY DRINKING AND FLIRTING AND JUST BEING A HOT MESS AND I LOVE HER FOR IT AND THAT MAKES HER THE PRESIDENT OF VICES
YOU1000000023_S0000070	THE VICE PRESIDENT BUT BE CAREFUL NOT TO DO THAT AROUND SOMEONE LIKE ASTRA WHO IS CONSTANTLY ACCUSING PEOPLE OF TREASON FOR NO GOOD REASON
YOU1000000023_S0000072	HERE'S AN ARCHETYPE I CALL WHAT THE FUCK AND IT'S THE THREE CHARACTERS THAT MAKE ME SAY WHAT THE FUCK FIRE EMBLEM PEOPLE LIKE PERN WHO IS SAID TO BE A SWEET ROBINHOOD TYPE EXCEPT HE DOES KIDNAP A YOUNG GIRL AND KEEPS HER AS HIS SLAVE
YOU1000000023_S0000073	OR THARJA WHO PRACTICES CURSES ON HER OWN DAUGHTER OR ROGER WHO IS ACTUALLY HE'S NOT ACTUALLY THAT BAD
YOU1000000023_S0000074	BUT FIRE EMBLEM DOES GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO MAKE HIS END SCREEN SAY THAT HE NEVER GETS A DATE AND HE STAYS SINGLE FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE AND IT'S LIKE WHAT THE FUCK FIRE EMBLEM YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO HIM DIRTY LIKE THAT
YOU1000000023_S0000075	THE NEXT ARCHETYPE IS CALLED ACTUALLY PRETTY INTERESTING THESE CHARACTERS ARE THREE DIMENSIONAL AND WELL DEVELOPED PEOPLE LIKE LIBRA WHO STRUGGLES WITH HIS FAITH AND HAS INCREDIBLE SELF DOUBT EVEN THOUGH HE'S DOING ALL HE CAN TO HELP THOSE AROUND HIM
YOU1000000023_S0000076	OR RHEES WHO DREAMS OF BEING A SWORDFIGHTER BUT HIS WEAK CONSTITUTION WON'T ALLOW HIM TO BECOME ONE AND SO HE HELPS IN THE WAYS HE CAN BUT HIS WHOLE STORY IS ONE OF UNFULFILLED DREAMS
YOU1000000023_S0000078	AND THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO INTERESTING CHARACTERS IN FIRE EMBLEM UNTIL WE GET TO RAPHAEL MY SWEET BULKY BOY WHO ONLY CARES ABOUT EATING AND TRAINING AND NOT ABOUT STUDYING
YOU1000000023_S0000094	UH AND THAT JUST SOUNDS LIKE A PRETTY RUN DOWN THE MILL AWKWARD FAMILY REUNION WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT THESE ONES ARE JUST THEIR STRANGE CHARACTERS THAT HAVE UH THAT ARE GOOD AT IF YOU INCLUDE DEMETRY IN THIS HE HAS AN EYE PAD

YOU1000000029_S0000057	TALKING ABOUT WE'VE HAD OHIO THAT IS GONE FOR CLINTON WE HAVE KENTUCKY WHICH DOES A MUST WIN SO STATE TOO CLOSE TO CALL
YOU1000000029_S0000058	YOU SEE THAT THAT UM FLORIDA HAS GONE TO UH PRESIDENT CLINTON IF IF DOLE IS IN TROUBLE IN THE SOUTH DO YOU SEE ANY SCENARIO BY WHICH HE COULD WIN THIS PRESIDENCY TONIGHT
YOU1000000029_S0000059	WELL JERRY AS I MENTIONED BEFORE WE WENT ON I JUST CAME OFF OF THE NINETY SIX HOUR TRIP WITH SENATOR DOLE WE SAW ENTHUSIASM EVERY PLACE WE WENT I THINK THAT CALIFORNIA IS STILL IN PLAY
YOU1000000029_S0000060	I THINK THAT UM THERE'S A LOT OF SOUTHERN STATES THAT UH WENT FOR PRESIDENT CLINTON LAST TIME AND I CERTAINLY THINK THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY BE UH QUOTE UNDECIDED I STILL BELIEVE CONTINENT IN INDIANA FOR EXAMPLE WE'LL GO
YOU1000000029_S0000061	FOR UH SENATOR DOUGLAS BUT I I I DON'T DISCOUNT THE IMPORTANCE OF FARRAND AND OHIO THEY'RE IMPORTANT STATES
YOU1000000029_S0000062	SO THAT SO THAT WITH ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL IF THIS TREND CONTINUES SENATOR DOLE WILL SAY IN WASHINGTON OR GO BACK TO KANSAS BUT NOT BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
YOU1000000029_S0000067	MY FEELING IS THAT WE PICK UP LIKE ONE SEAT I'M SURE THAT JOHN BRO MAY HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW BUT UM I THINK WE PICK UP THE FOUR SOUTHERN OPEN DEMOCRAT SEATS

YOU1000000029_S0000079	BECAUSE OF WHAT HE SAYS OR SHE SAYS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE STATES IT'S NOT THAT CONNECTED TO THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION I THINK YOU CAN HAVE PEOPLE VOTING FOR PRESIDENT CLINTON AND PERHAPS VOTING FOR A REPUBLICAN SENATOR
YOU1000000029_S0000081	ISN'T IT TRUE THAT THE PROBLEM IS THAT SOME OF YOUR CANDIDATES IN THE SOUTH LIKE MARYLAND AND LOUISIANA AND MAX KLEIN AND GEORGIA WERE ELECTION YEAR MODERATES THEY'VE BEEN LIBERALS ALL THEIR LIFE AND PERHAPS THE VOTERS SAW THROUGH THEM
YOU1000000029_S0000082	BOB IS REALLY INTERESTING THEY CHARGING MARY LANDLORD WOULD BE IN A LIBERAL HERE'S A PERSON WHO SUPPORTS THE DEATH PENALTY SUPPORTS CARRYING CONCEALED WEAPONS IN LOUISIANA AND ALSO WILL SUPPORT A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO BALANCE THE BUDGET THAT DOESN'T SOUND VERY LIBERAL
YOU1000000029_S0000088	THERE YOU GO AGAIN FALLING FOR SOME OF THE REPUBLICAN RHETORIC SHE CLEARLY HAS SAID THAT SHE WOULD HAVE VOTED JUST LIKE ME AND BENEDICT JOHNSON ON THAT ISSUE BUT HER OPPONENT AND OTHERS KEEP SAYING WELL THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID VERY CLEARLY
