POD1000000005_S0000209	mister chang had to review every single real estate contract and was involved with the opening of every new store which at the pace that they are expanding is is a huge responsibility

POD1000000011_S0000097	that is right and at the preschool we sat down with one of the lead researchers sudha swaminathan and she helped us understand a lot more about how to grow children who love math
POD1000000011_S0000099	instead swaminathan says think small she is a professor in early childhood education at eastern connecticut state and her special focus is on early math learning
POD1000000011_S0000100	and sudha and her colleagues have done lots of research to see what kinds of childhood experiences lead to better performance in math later on
POD1000000011_S0000116	naming the shapes in both english and in spanish when we played this tape for rosemarie she said
POD1000000011_S0000135	you probably remember the kind cory they are perfect for hitting your friends
POD1000000011_S0000203	remember sudha warned us
POD1000000011_S0000217	we are sitting at a round table and i could ask you anya what is the shape of this table
POD1000000011_S0000219	i mean so it is but a better question would be to say anya why did you choose the circle for our table
POD1000000011_S0000228	and the teacher karla alamo was a master she just backed off and let him do his thing because you know what he is doing
POD1000000011_S0000272	sudha actually told us this is a good tip for parents to try too you can make a mistake and give your kids a chance to correct you with math or you know anything else

POD1000000012_S0000113	so i remember as a child watching cookie monster and just being like what is wrong with this maniac
POD1000000012_S0000161	rosemarie explained that self regulation is not just about treats ah ha self regulation is a set of skills that helps us reach our goals
POD1000000012_S0000185	but ken fujita who we heard from earlier who said cookie monster was a maniac
POD1000000012_S0000190	so by software ken is talking about the skills and the strategies that parents can help kids practice to improve their self regulation
POD1000000012_S0000234	just like i did with cookie monster i know it was silly and probably sounded a little ridiculous
POD1000000012_S0000258	the experiment has been repeated many many times since it was 1st done by walter mischel in the late 1960s
POD1000000012_S0000263	and by hot ken fujita means intense or urgent something that you want to act on right now but he says
POD1000000012_S0000290	cory look over there it is a bright

POD1000000016_S0000056	from the new york times magazine i am nikole hannah jones this is 1619
POD1000000016_S0000147	the civil war has been going on for about a year and abraham lincoln is worried because the war is not going well and because it is not going well he is feeling like he might have to do something drastic
POD1000000016_S0000172	and to make it even worse lincoln then tells them that it is their fault that the country is fighting a civil war at all
POD1000000016_S0000183	after everything that black americans have been through in this country that they did not immediately take up lincoln is offer and go somewhere else and start over is really an astounding testimony to their belief in the american ideals
POD1000000016_S0000237	and the bus driver gets off the bus and then calls and tells woodard that he needs to get off the bus as well so woodard gets off the bus and before he can even utter a word
POD1000000016_S0000248	so woodard is beating was not at all unusual world war 2 had done exactly what many white people had feared
POD1000000016_S0000251	would find that this actually made them a target of some of the most severe violence but what was unusual was what happened after woodard is case was picked up by the n double a c p and they take him on a bit of a tour
POD1000000019_S0000021	billy swan is one jeannie c riley the singer of harper valley p t a is the other one those are the only 2 people alive who have had their 1st single go number one country and pop
POD1000000019_S0000040	one day jeannie says she gets a letter from the great pedal steel player weldon myrick who would seen her sing at a local jamboree and just had to write her to say that he thought of jeannie is singing every time he heard connie smith sing
POD1000000019_S0000045	up in nashville they drive around lower broadway to look at tootsie is orchid lounge ernest tubb is record shop and the ryman auditorium all that country music tourist stuff
POD1000000019_S0000051	jeannie c riley is autobiography is really the only source i can use for this stuff and it is super sketchy to say the least
POD1000000019_S0000065	in the very next paragraph she says she would already studied the lyrics which she would have gotten from shelby why does she have shelby presenting the lyrics to her here with such pomp as if for the very 1st time
POD1000000019_S0000074	if they will come by the office of sure fire his publishing company a few days later they drop in to the sure fire office and meet johnny russell who is a staff songwriter there johnny russell listens to her sing
POD1000000019_S0000075	they decide to have her go in the studio that night and the next to record a 4 song demo tape they have a photographer take some pictures of her jeannie thinks all of this means she is on her way to becoming a star
POD1000000019_S0000084	as they cross the city limits sign into nashville she and mickey make a pact that they will always travel together as a family the baby too quote show business might chew up other folks and spit them onto the sidewalk but not us we would show them
POD1000000019_S0000090	based out of new york phil blackman is our big bad wolf uncle johnny bought a gas station right before jeannie and mickey moved to nashville so that is where mickey starts working
POD1000000019_S0000095	25 miles away from where jeannie was from she apparently thinks she can meet this lady say hey i am from texas too and get a record deal or something
POD1000000019_S0000096	she has no idea where this lady is office is supposed to be she just starts walking into publishing companies to find out if that lady works there or not when some kid asks if she is trying to get a demo tape heard jeannie pulls out her tape and the kid takes a listen
POD1000000019_S0000097	he seems to like it plays it for his boss who says it sounds too much like loretta lynn and they tell jeannie to kick rocks she goes back to her car with the baby and cries then decides to drive over to the gas station where mickey works
POD1000000019_S0000104	but jerry thinks they can get monument to back off the name change if they stay on it jeannie gets shown off at a d j convention introduced to everyone in town as tina stephens the next girl they are going to sign and do big things with
POD1000000019_S0000107	remember this sentence that d j paul perry sends jeannie is demo and a promo picture to phil blackman in new york city
POD1000000019_S0000115	then one day in blackman is apartment jeannie is laying naked on the couch after having sex with him when she is suddenly blinded by flashes of bright light there is blackman holding a camera with a strobe flash attachment
POD1000000019_S0000126	he hires jeannie as a secretary which is where she is working when a songwriter friend asks her to sing on the demo of his new song he wants shelby singleton at plantation records to hear
POD1000000019_S0000127	i could not find a recording of jeannie singing it but i found the songwriter singing it himself so you can try to imagine what jeannie would have sounded like on the demo
POD1000000019_S0000128	clark bentley is old town drunk comes out on plantation records in 1968
POD1000000019_S0000135	she is thinking about that when perry says if jeannie does not take this deal then he can not represent her any more it is not going to get any better than this she signs the papers goes home and cries about it
POD1000000019_S0000141	shelby tells jeannie they will use her middle initial to make her stand out more from the other jeannies and add an i to her 1st name so people know it is not pronounced jean
POD1000000019_S0000142	finding out she really does not have to be rhonda renae plus the fact that everyone in the room seems certain she just cut a massive hit song improves jeannie is mood
POD1000000019_S0000151	when she finds out she is the one paying for all of that jeannie and mickey do not need the help spending money they are throwing down major cash on clothing jewelry hairstyles cars all the usual rock star stuff
POD1000000019_S0000155	anyway pretty soon jeannie starts spending too much time with her manager paul perry one night they are sitting around holding hands and perry is talking about how careful jeannie has to be now that she is on top
POD1000000019_S0000159	made from her old sessions with him now that jeannie has got the biggest hit in the nation these records will sell
POD1000000019_S0000161	blackman has got a manilla envelope like you see in every movie about a private detective and he wants to give it to jeannie but 1st she has got to sign a new piece of paper saying she will not sue him for releasing her old recordings
POD1000000019_S0000170	which is also the explanation for why jeannie would be in las vegas opening up for johnny paycheck when all she is supposedly done is one barely released single for black rose records
POD1000000019_S0000184	something physical for jeannie to play pretend with to keep the whole charade going it was called you write the music credited to jean riley released on little darlin records in 1967
POD1000000019_S0000188	now here are the 2 big questions i do not think i can or should even try to answer did aubrey mayhew and jeannie c riley have an affair
POD1000000019_S0000201	she gets to do pickin wild mountain berries with glen campbell on t v
POD1000000019_S0000208	if you are starting to get the idea that jeannie is always thought of as little more than a puppet for the people behind the scenes of her career i would say that seems accurate
POD1000000019_S0000213	and while the song is actually sung by the daughter character who does not dress that way every time you see jeannie c riley she looks like missus johnson
POD1000000019_S0000228	from the nightmare she describes you would expect that to be the only time she ever toked up but there is a video clip of ralph emery interviewing her seems to suggest otherwise
POD1000000019_S0000234	the only other woman to do that in the 1900s is dolly parton with 9 to 5 in 1981 making jeannie the 1st woman to ever do it if you do not count the farce with little darlin records
POD1000000019_S0000252	here is her doing it in joni cash show
POD1000000019_S0000261	like the l a times pop critic robert hilburn who reviewed a jeannie c riley concert in 1971 under the headline letter talent
POD1000000019_S0000268	she always had a crack band behind her the harper valley express they usually made the tempo of everything faster to really put some gas in the tank and it is impossible to deny jeannie is charisma as a performer
POD1000000019_S0000274	not only was jeannie not a one hit wonder she made good albums with very little filler check out the album track from 1972 never even released as a single called without you
POD1000000019_S0000277	without you is from jeannie is 2nd album on m g m after leaving plantation records in 1972 in what shelby singleton called a breach of contract
POD1000000019_S0000291	a k a the exact opposite audience of the only reason anyone knows jeannie c riley is name harper valley p t a a song highly critical of hypocrisy in social groups with hardcore conservative values
POD1000000019_S0000301	next move ask tom t hall to write another harper valley p t a a thing he had been very vocal about his reluctance to do but also he is a big softie
POD1000000019_S0000355	and that disclaimer is written by jeannie is co author who i also feel the mansion is a preacher here is what he writes quote to keep from hurting some of the folks jeannie loves we have changed the names of several people in the book
POD1000000019_S0000374	one thing that is really interesting that we heard today is unlike as you heard in the 2nd episode of the podcast loretta is recording of the pill
POD1000000019_S0000378	i thinks money talks i think that by the time any of those would be buzz kills started paying attention this song was already the number one pop song in america and it went number one pop before it went number one country
POD1000000019_S0000379	every major record label in nashville had been falling all over itself for 15 years trying to do that they have made jeannie c riley the mayor of nashville if she did it a 2nd time
POD1000000019_S0000387	then 2 years later in 1971 as jeannie stated in the book ah this is really aggravating for me to have to talk about right now because this is just my fault
POD1000000021_S0000006	that is trina edwards we were talking about her husband edwin edwards the former governor of louisiana
POD1000000021_S0000018	edwards served 8 years on corruption charges
POD1000000021_S0000042	there were 6 grand jury investigations during edwards is 1st term
POD1000000021_S0000046	edwards led louisiana for 8 years leaving office in march 1980
POD1000000021_S0000047	the only thing stopping him from being governor for life for term limits that edwards himself had pushed for
POD1000000021_S0000058	edwards was right to believe that 1983 election was a lock he would win it with 62% of the vote
POD1000000021_S0000061	if there is one thing louisiana governor elect edwin edwards knows it is how to have a good time even with a $4000000 campaign deficit staring him down
POD1000000021_S0000062	edwards chartered 2 jumbo jets announced he was going to paris and invited anyone willing to contribute $10000 to come on along
POD1000000021_S0000096	when i asked edwards about the case he did not sound all that sorry
POD1000000021_S0000111	buddy roemer was a congressman from north louisiana
POD1000000021_S0000121	there would be no runoff romer would be the next governor of louisiana
POD1000000021_S0000123	but that is not how edwards saw it dropping out of the race that was the 1st step in his comeback plan
POD1000000021_S0000133	in 1991 david duke was at the height of his powers
POD1000000021_S0000137	this is slow burn i am josh levine episode 5 the road to hell
POD1000000021_S0000140	that is exactly what simplisafe has spend a decade fighting against
POD1000000021_S0000148	simplisafe was named best overall home security of 2020 by u s news and road report
POD1000000021_S0000153	it was 1930 and the governor was huey long
POD1000000021_S0000157	long was shot and killed at the state capital 5 years later
POD1000000021_S0000159	yes long was a corrupt dictator and sure he orchestrated a kidnapping
POD1000000021_S0000161	edwin edwards carried on huey long tradition of economic populism
POD1000000021_S0000162	like long edwards use money snatched from big oil to build bridges and hospitals
POD1000000021_S0000167	in reality duke is brand of populism had nothing to do with shrinking government
POD1000000021_S0000169	duke is message the journalist john mcginnis wrote held a lot of appeal for the children and grandchildren of huey long is old voters
POD1000000021_S0000172	they want to see where huey long was shot and where david duke says
POD1000000021_S0000181	roemer is big initiative was a plan to modernize the state is approach to taxation
POD1000000021_S0000184	romer was adamant that his fiscal reform plan was not a tax increase
POD1000000021_S0000187	david duke then a newly elected state legislator was one of the governor is most outspoken critics
POD1000000021_S0000197	digging louisiana is already troubled economy ever deeper in debt and forcing reform minded governor buddy roemer to scramble his way out of a new financial crisis
POD1000000021_S0000206	but strother who would helped romer win in 1987 was available to work on the governor is re election campaign
POD1000000021_S0000219	roemer actually liked the rubber band idea
POD1000000021_S0000225	in his state of the state address romer apologized to the legislature for his inflexibility and insensitivity
POD1000000021_S0000228	for strother the self help stuff was bad but what happened next was worse
POD1000000021_S0000231	i saw mary madelin a whole bunch of high echelon republicans sitting around a table with bud by the dining room table with buddy
POD1000000021_S0000242	ideology aside romer thought the move was smart strategy
POD1000000021_S0000243	edwin edwards was going to grab votes from his left no matter what
POD1000000021_S0000244	romer figured that branding himself a republican would help stave off right wing challengers who might threaten his re election
POD1000000021_S0000245	the statewide polls showed that the top 3 candidates are duke edwards and myself
POD1000000021_S0000250	democrats in louisiana felt burned by romer and republicans including state party officials were not sure they could trust him either
POD1000000021_S0000252	resented that romer had not included him in discussions about the party switch and romer forgetting the lessons of all i ever needed to know i learned in kindergarten cursed out nungesser rather than trying to appease him
POD1000000021_S0000254	that endorsement would not go to buddy roemer or david duke
POD1000000021_S0000260	then duke was egging them on you know to disrupt things
POD1000000021_S0000263	buddy roemer had tried to consolidate the conservative vote
POD1000000021_S0000296	by 1991 the open primary was open in a way edwards maybe had not anticipated
POD1000000021_S0000305	duke could pass the bucket with impunity during his 1990 senate campaign because that was a federal race
POD1000000021_S0000307	hamstrung by these new rules duke held fewer rallies as a candidate for governor than when he ran for the senate and edwards is fundraising slowed to a trickle
POD1000000021_S0000312	raymond strother saw it up close during the 1987 race
POD1000000021_S0000326	the problem for romer was that a lot of swing voters felt drawn to another candidate
POD1000000021_S0000343	it was not clear based on polling how white people in louisiana were responding to duke is latest attempt at image management
POD1000000021_S0000344	susan howell had been struggling for years to get a handle on duke is voters
POD1000000021_S0000355	this became a research challenge for howell and her graduate students how could they get david duke silent army to break its silence
POD1000000021_S0000365	romer is political consultant raymond strother heard that speculation
POD1000000021_S0000373	when i got edwards on the phone
POD1000000021_S0000378	did you or your supporters do anything to help duke get into the run off with you
POD1000000021_S0000384	the edwards campaign it turns out had a totally different secret alliance
POD1000000021_S0000391	to him acord says the 2 of them hatched a plan
POD1000000021_S0000404	did governor edwards know about this strategy
POD1000000021_S0000407	when i asked edwards about the alliance he told me he did not know anything about it
POD1000000021_S0000408	in john mcginniss is book about the 1991 campaign clyde holloway is campaign advisor brian wagner also denied making any such deal
POD1000000021_S0000421	he also thinks edwards is totally corrupt
POD1000000021_S0000423	i am not saying it is immoral it is just amoral completely without regard to the morality of trying to help david duke get into the runoff and whether or not that would be good or bad for the state of louisiana
POD1000000021_S0000430	but what if they were wrong what if david duke won
POD1000000021_S0000446	on october 19th 1991 duke is fans gathered at the pontchartrain center in his home territory of jefferson parish
POD1000000021_S0000467	david duke was in the runoff with 32% of the vote
POD1000000021_S0000469	edwin edwards buddy romer is political consultant raymond strother knew his man was going to come in 3rd
POD1000000021_S0000475	buddy roemer finished 5 points behind david duke

POD1000000023_S0000011	and kant goes more in the direction of a priori fact derived from reason but either way these thinkers are in their own way trying to use reason to arrive at a universal that guarantees human beings are born with natural rights
POD1000000023_S0000026	but rorty would extend that tutelage to the rational dogma that was to come in the future because of how over ambitious we were at the beginning of the enlightenment about what rationality could produce
POD1000000023_S0000031	this was not an anti enlightenment idea at all to rorty this was the project of the enlightenment left to play itself out
POD1000000023_S0000038	maybe it is pointless to try to do our best impressions of locke and kant and try to access the universe through reason
POD1000000023_S0000048	but to rorty this would be making the same mistake that locke and kant made in our example from before about human rights

POD1000000023_S0000093	so it should be said rorty is not talking about ordinary language when he writes that he is talking about something else that we are going to get deep into here in a minute but i want to point out that this comparison he is making here

POD1000000042_S0000611	well how do you how do you pick how do you decide like what you know how you decide like when donald trump does some i mean you going to forgive him for the shit
POD1000000042_S0000622	trump was the complete opposite of that in their response was to just lose their fucking minds right now that is not always the case so let us say you ride a train through the city
POD1000000042_S0000628	well it is hard i i get when i say but it is hard it is hard not to do that when elsie and her colleagues are tied not make a list of people can who support trump i was as a trump supporter
POD1000000042_S0000648	republic no republicans are doubling and flipped the house in 2022 because that lets us be real honest about what is going to happen even if anything biden was going to push would have made some positive dent
POD1000000042_S0000658	but what i hope is that i hope if anything if anything this next 4 years like abi said they probably will not pass much if i will not change my job we we i think we know that the man my hope for this country is is that if he does anything
POD1000000042_S0000665	yeah but he never would have used up trump right as us know he does not have that in his tool box
POD1000000042_S0000683	which is what donald trump gave all the money too and says amen 0 we have not we have got the cure and that is we were 90% right now we are going to about 50000000 of those guys out out into the world in january
POD1000000042_S0000688	let us be real about this the reason donald trump did not get reelected is not because people do not like the way he talks right because
POD1000000042_S0000727	ah you guys has been killing a man and it is a it is a fun show we enjoy ah alfred anthony the anthony holloway dakota meyer i am ross paterson we are the drinking bros good night everyone

POD1000000043_S0000080	and there are a bunch of epidemiologists scientists and others saying that fochi is time line was way too optimistic for 12 to 18 months 11 months that is what this vaccine hem in 11 months
POD1000000043_S0000084	this section is jon basically being so mad at like a series of of articles in the atlantic they were so annoying over the course of many moves like the doom and gloom publication of choice for several months
POD1000000043_S0000100	failing to make any headway failing to actually stand up to trump of doing the morally reprehensible an easy thing but like here is this guy fauci who i think like we will look back and say like did an extraordinary thing of serving his country
POD1000000043_S0000118	and so that is why you know that just it is horrible that we have to read these stories over and over again of of trump is politicizing the process when if he had to shut up and stepped back and let the process work things would be better
POD1000000043_S0000150	yeah the grandpa joe
POD1000000043_S0000169	on wonka is bullshit guest worker program
POD1000000043_S0000204	i am not saying that they should do it trump seems to be attempting to do with his executive order which is you know use the d p a or use the government to say hey pfizer all your doses are for us they are not for other countries like that is immoral
POD1000000043_S0000231	and i do not mean hopefully will figure out who did it i bet the e mail just like unopened in jared is and box of one of his you know his college roommates ah you know told him not to do or something
POD1000000043_S0000252	is he cares more about private equity backed insurance company profits than regular people mcconnell is one of the worst people in political life and political history he is disgusting he is a corporate stooge he is cynical
POD1000000043_S0000257	but this is this surprises me not just like you and you know why mitch mcconnell is going to get his way on this and that this deal is probably going to pass with all of the shit that he wants or does not want it is because he has got the fucking numbers and he has got donald trump in the white house like i thought you know
POD1000000043_S0000258	bernie sanders said with that the deal is bad we should not support the deal and like i i agree with them in the sense that the deal is fucking bad the bipartisan compromise is bad
POD1000000043_S0000260	what is the what is the choice here like you are going to you are not going to negotiate a better package with these republicans who you are going to get to vote for more money you are going to get susan collins and mitt romney to vote for more money and lisa murkowski no they said this is the best that they would do
POD1000000043_S0000261	and if you do not take the deal and we do not win georgia we are not going to get a better deal when joe biden is president and joe biden is not going to have a mechanism to force a better deal because mitch mcconnell is going to sit there and say fuck you i have the numbers i do not have to pass a deal
POD1000000043_S0000264	to 2000000000000 to 15 now we are trying to get to one i i what i do not know is what happens if they replace the state and local aid as it was drafted with direct payments does that become something that gets people like bernie back on board
POD1000000043_S0000265	i do not know maybe maybe you try that i mean bernie is one thing but like like josh holly or some of these republicans who want direct payments yeah i would i would try to get as much in there as i could you know and i will try to push more direct payments for sure but like at the end of the day
POD1000000043_S0000301	i hate to say guys 0 well one obvious thing that would be helpful is winning these georgia run offs but then you know i hate to say it but it would it would also help i think if brian kemp ah survived his primary challenge

POD1000000044_S0000070	according to alvin once you have discovered this optimal personhood you can shake off what others want and live on your own terms
POD1000000044_S0000072	and for these kinds of radical results alvin was given a lifetime achievement award from the american psychological association
POD1000000044_S0000073	one psychology text book even goes so far as to describe alvin as being quote as important as freud
POD1000000044_S0000075	but this is not a story about alvin is professional life his life inside the office this is a story about alvin is real life
POD1000000044_S0000098	and as the final custody hearing approached alvin is focus on rachel intensified he wanted to prove to the court that rachel was better off him so he had about a half dozen social workers and psychologists offer assessments
POD1000000044_S0000110	she never was able to enjoy whatever it is we were doing at the moment it was always always 0 if only rachel were here we could all be together and i would be saying but but we are here now
POD1000000044_S0000112	when he turn 13 john invited rachel to his bar mitzvah but alvin would not let her go rachel sent a poem instead
POD1000000044_S0000121	so when alvin refused john yet again rachel told her brother to come visit her instead they had not seen each other in 8 years were she the same sister that you remembered
POD1000000044_S0000132	and together john and rachel made a series of disturbing discoveries the 1st of which was the script
POD1000000044_S0000149	the 2nd thing discovered among the files was a letter from rachel to her mom in it she begs judy to let her live with alvin but there were 2 copies one written in rachel is hand and one written in alvin is
POD1000000044_S0000152	in every photo from that period with her mother rachel is wearing a frown
POD1000000044_S0000178	how is alvin able to exert this kind of power over a social worker someone who is supposed to be an impartial outsider john and rachel could not understand it
POD1000000044_S0000179	but that night when rachel googled joyce she was shocked to realize that joyce had not been an impartial outsider at all joyce was a family friend
POD1000000044_S0000181	rachel recognized joyce as the kind dark haired woman whose house she visited as a child
POD1000000044_S0000206	sylvie and robert discovered that though their lives are changed their feelings for each other remained the same
POD1000000044_S0000210	i find joyce the social worker is facebook and e mail address right away and i messaged to ask if she would be willing to speak with john and rachel about their parent is custody battle i do not hear back for several weeks
POD1000000044_S0000227	ted is not anywhere close to crying
POD1000000044_S0000230	ted you are on the verge of crying
POD1000000044_S0000237	as the credits rolled i have learnt that wow alvin the therapist is alvin the therapist ted the patient is actually bob the actor
POD1000000044_S0000250	it seems there was the way the actress was given to talking about an abusive relationship and then there was the way that alvin preferred her to talk about one and so the actress was replaced and bob was shown a video to illustrate what alvin did not want
POD1000000044_S0000266	john is seated in a chair his posture upright rachel is sitting back on a couch
POD1000000044_S0000282	joyce settles into an armchair
POD1000000044_S0000297	joyce inhales through clenched teeth shakes her head
POD1000000044_S0000305	joyce is husband at the time was a colleague of alvin is that is how she 1st came to know alvin he and her husband both taught in the local university psychology department joyce says her husband would always come home with al stories
POD1000000044_S0000311	joyce relates the anecdote to illustrate the kind of guy alvin was but john hears something else in the story
POD1000000044_S0000339	and at that point joyce and her husband had just arrived in town while her husband taught at the university joyce did not she hoped to some day but she was still fairly young
POD1000000044_S0000431	rachel will later tell me that because of the way her dad brainwashed her she often can not trust her memories so it feels good that her memory of joyce is correct joyce is nice but rachel is nice too and can sense how badly joyce is feeling
POD1000000044_S0000440	and i have been with my wife 37 years and thankfully now you know rachel and i came back together on her own and i am very close with my sister
POD1000000044_S0000443	damage done to us can often become damaged we do to others and on it goes but watching john and rachel i am struck by the way they are breaking that cycle not just in their lives but right here in the room
POD1000000044_S0000451	when john 1st became a psychologist he would see alvin at various conferences where alvin was received as a star
POD1000000044_S0000473	when i raised the subject of alvin is relationship with his kids in how that connected to his optimal self howard says he can not really speak to that alvin did not bring up his kids much

YOU1000000019_S0000002	the cube was designed by qiyi mofangge and was approved by mats valk of course the cube is his main but let us see how the cube actually performs and whether it is right for you
YOU1000000021_S0000004	the d m w is a continuously spinning slot machine system that confers various bonuses effects and attacks based on the results including how zack levels up
YOU1000000021_S0000007	the game begins with zack fair soldier 2nd class of the group called soldier a private military army owned by the shinra electric power company in the city of midgar
YOU1000000021_S0000009	zack has tremendous skills and talent but is unfortunately a little over confident reckless at times as pointed out by his fellow soldier another 1st class named sephiroth
YOU1000000021_S0000011	angeal helps him out reminding him to temper his aspirations with passionate dreams and steadfast honor
YOU1000000021_S0000012	zack hears from a fellow soldier of the mass desertion of troops in soldier and he is soon called in to speak with the director of soldier a man named lazard
YOU1000000021_S0000019	suddenly angeal goes missing and sephiroth suspects he too has betrayed them and deserted though zack fervently denies it
YOU1000000021_S0000020	after the mission director lazard confirms angeal really is gone for unknown reasons but assigns zack on a new mission
YOU1000000021_S0000027	finding angeal is mother gillian she notes zack is the restless puppy angeal often spoke about and she tells him genesis came by a month ago with an army of minions and proceeded to start killing townsfolk
YOU1000000021_S0000045	as sephiroth talks more with zack he elaborates more how angeal genesis and himself were close friends and even though sephiroth himself was the company is prized war hero genesis himself wanted such prestige as well
YOU1000000021_S0000048	surveying the monster sephiroth deduces the duo are in league with doctor hollander which ties into the story he just told
YOU1000000021_S0000054	hollander himself appears he is surprised to see them but explains only he can stop genesis is degradation after which genesis himself appears and explains hollander will not be captured
YOU1000000021_S0000063	she is naturally surprised and actually likes his unique eyes to which zack continues to flirt showing off the trademark mako infused eyes of a soldier
YOU1000000021_S0000069	later zack goes to visit aerith when tseng halts him to call him into a mission to modeoheim and gives zack pause when he says he also knows aerith but will not elaborate
YOU1000000021_S0000072	zack is from the tiny village of gongaga and this village is from nibelheim who introduces himself as cloud
YOU1000000021_S0000073	as the mission for hollander continues genesis moves to kill him as he is already begun visibly degrading and claims he does not need hollander anymore
YOU1000000021_S0000076	on his way out he is met by angeal as well as hollander who explain the g in project g was not for genesis but for gillian who was angeal is mother who apparently took her own life earlier in banora
YOU1000000021_S0000077	the experiment was 2 fold gillian had jenova cells injected into her while she was pregnant with angeal and genesis simply had jenova cells implanted directly into him as a test tube baby
YOU1000000021_S0000079	reason being angeal can use the jenova cells as a 2 way conduit as intended angeal then explains his cells can absorb genetic traits and pass them to others beyond what genesis can manage which is only imprint them onto others
YOU1000000021_S0000082	after winning a bitter victory a degrading angeal is grateful that zack ended him with dignity and honor before dying he passes on his family sword and legacy of honor the buster sword to zack
YOU1000000021_S0000088	she teases him about his girlfriend aerith and explains she is under constant turk surveillance as it turns out she is the last living member of a race called the ancient
YOU1000000021_S0000089	zack is surprised not only to learn this but also that aerith never told him
YOU1000000021_S0000092	and so zack is vacation is over as the 3 of them are to investigate attack on junon
YOU1000000021_S0000093	it turns out more genesis clones were attacking and this time hollander was even there though he gets away once again
YOU1000000021_S0000095	returning to aerith he finds a monster dog there but its not really causing problems though zack notes its also an angeal copy and it seems keen to protect aerith
YOU1000000021_S0000101	as their mission in mentions nothing of their old friends sephiroth privately confesses to zack that he is seriously considering leaving shinra as well depending on what happens in this mission
YOU1000000021_S0000105	as they arrive sephiroth makes small talk asking cloud how it feels to be home again and trying to relate as he has no original town and all he knows is his mother is name to be jenova who died after he was born
YOU1000000021_S0000106	in town they are met by a local town girl by the name of tifa
YOU1000000021_S0000107	when tifa learns he is a soldier 1st class she seems surprised by the fact they only sent him and sephiroth and begins to ask something else but stops and runs off instead
YOU1000000021_S0000117	sephiroth comes to a horrifying hypothesis that its possible he was created the same way and it becomes a crisis of identity ironically identical to his friends genesis and angeal
YOU1000000021_S0000128	afterwards cloud wishes he were strong like zack but zack warns him not to get tangled up with soldier
YOU1000000021_S0000132	an suddenly on fire with many townsfolk slain even cloud is being once again and around the corner is sephiroth himself calmly standing amidst the flames
YOU1000000021_S0000135	confronting sephiroth zack is ignored as sephiroth insists his mother the ancient was the superior race and they should have ruled the planet
YOU1000000021_S0000137	finally fed up with the crimes of humans and shinra in particular sephiroth sees what angeal and genesis kept warning about and chooses to stand alone
YOU1000000021_S0000152	cloud succumbs to his injuries next to zack and as they both pass out doctor hojo arrives on the scene and chooses cloud to be his next test subject
YOU1000000021_S0000156	however shinra labels them both fugitive samples so they find themselves now running from the army and cassini actually manages to catch up to them 1st
YOU1000000021_S0000157	he pleads with her to just walk away as he knows its a tall order to escape the turks but cassini chooses her duty over her personal feelings
YOU1000000021_S0000161	he knows they are hojo is latest experiments and modified versions of jenova is power runs through both of them
YOU1000000021_S0000171	almost to midgar zack stops to finally confront the failed and tortured creation of a jenova infused human who considers zack a perfect fusion of angeal is will and sephiroth is superior cells
YOU1000000021_S0000185	meanwhile tseng orders cassini and the other turks to find and save zack before the army finds them which cassini is very motivated to do
YOU1000000021_S0000186	though this is a near treasonous action tseng is willing to risk it for his friend and for aerith is sake
YOU1000000021_S0000188	unfortunately the army intercepts zack 1st and zack willingly chooses to fight and honorably protect cloud despite his own desire to return to aerith and save himself
YOU1000000021_S0000194	against all odds zack triumphs in his final stand but he is on his last legs as shinra begins reinforcing their troops firing countless bullets into a relentless zack
YOU1000000021_S0000199	meanwhile cloud finally wakes up and drags himself over to zack who is still barely alive and forces a smile for him and urges cloud to live on in his stead as his own living legacy
YOU1000000021_S0000204	as the game ends the trauma of the events unfortunately result in cloud blocking all memory of zack despite his promise
YOU1000000027_S0000009	alright the next journaling prompt is something that i learned from my friend kajal pandey this past sunday actually we did a live chat together on facebook if you want to watch that full live chat it is really amazing
YOU1000000033_S0000008	and i have to make a choice today jesus says to each one of us i came that you might have life and have it to the full the question is do we want it
YOU1000000033_S0000026	when i was 20 years old 1978 my sister convinced me to go to a conference at the university of notre dame and i always wanted to see notre dame touchdown jesus so i thought i will go
YOU1000000033_S0000070	and then i ah got involved in the charismatic renewal movement and then cardinal suenens asked me to move to belgium so it is not like i had a plan
YOU1000000033_S0000084	well i began with renewal ministries back in actually i i knew ralph for quite a number of years and we spoke at some conferences together and certainly had somewhat of a common mind
YOU1000000033_S0000085	and then peter came into the picture as well and the 3 of us just at different times collaborating at at a conference somewhere we began to see that we all had a kind of similar message
YOU1000000033_S0000094	how it all began i do not know if ralph mentioned this but kind of how it all began was he and i went to ah hear a talk in detroit at a large conference we came to hear one speaker at this larger conference
YOU1000000033_S0000099	and they started praying for us with ralph and i am just kind of watching and and it was one of the 1st times where i saw ah the gift of prophecy kind of a word of knowledge working in a in a very powerful way
YOU1000000033_S0000100	and they started saying things about ralph and about his life which they could not have known that were indications of how god had worked in him and the and what the lord wanted to do with him
YOU1000000033_S0000105	and so after it was all done we were driving home and saying wow what do you think of that you know and the ralph said just said you know scripture is very clear it says to never despise prophecy but test everything and cling to what is good
YOU1000000033_S0000154	and you know it was like like to you know of course so we ah we went there and after mass when he came to ralph who was next to me
YOU1000000033_S0000158	and i knew he did not want the whole 300 page answer so i said holy father i think what the spirit is saying to the church is jesus so he took my hand and he said jesus and i said jesus
YOU1000000033_S0000160	john paul 2nd is our patron and one of our one of our central the central patron maybe of ah renewal ministries and so he is a great intercessor for us we continue to pray we ask for his help i feel his presence especially when i am on mission internationally
YOU1000000033_S0000169	and more and more we are living in the growth of an international pagan culture that is becoming increasingly hostile to christ and the church where is their loyalty
YOU1000000033_S0000181	you know peter when you are right in the middle of it every day and you are getting up every day and doing what you are supposed to do sometimes you do not get the whole trajectory of what god is done and it is just amazing see what the lord has done with with us
YOU1000000033_S0000208	jesus is the light in the darkness and we want you to have this booklet at no cost just for the asking and we will be back
YOU1000000033_S0000211	in the words of pope emeritus benedict the 16th man is pushing god from the human horizon and as a result the light which comes from god is disappearing and humanity is losing its bearings
YOU1000000033_S0000216	well peter we have ah we have seen how the lord has worked with us but the lord wants to work with everybody like that you know

YOU1000000110_S0000083	against the belgium it would be quite the opposite messi capitalizing on a mistake for 1st few minutes

YOU1000000130_S0000011	by the time henry had become a teenager the steam engine was already making its way into the farming community coal powered threshing machines and sawmills were becoming common sight and henry was learning how they worked and how to fix them

YOU1000000130_S0000018	and it was gaining some traction in europe but it was practically unheard of in america henry would get the chance to work on suchan engine himself in 1889 and he instantly recognized the advantages it had
YOU1000000130_S0000020	this also allowed the gas engine to start quickly whereas steam engines of the time needed as much as 30 minutes to heat up the water and generate enough steam to start working the gas engine was an innovation henry fell in love with

YOU1000000130_S0000033	he leased a factory and planned to hire a 100 workers to make his new delivery wagon as he called it but it turned out that building such complex machines in high numbers was much more difficult than henry imagined

YOU1000000130_S0000044	the biggest game changer of all however was henry is chance visit to a slaughterhouse in chicago he saw there something interesting a disassembly line so to speak where multiple workers would process carcasses moving down a line

YOU1000000139_S0000005	12 to 11 before the last game and as a world champion i had my last chance to retain the title by beating karpov in this game 4 who forgave 24 i was not rushing from the beginning i tried to play a very quiet positional game
YOU1000000139_S0000011	next day when i showed up at this stage i was a couple of minutes earlier i have to say that with my coaches we have been analyzing this but we could not find any decisive ideas and then i saw karpov entering the stage

POD1000000004_S0000137	our pal doctor green used blue apron for about a year which is way longer than most of its customers stuck around
POD1000000004_S0000144	and so blue apron was at a crossroads says alex konrad
POD1000000004_S0000147	so blue apron had 3 choices pack it in sell or go public we are going to take a quick break when we come back join me in my outdated condo kitchen as i whip up some delicious blue apron meals
POD1000000004_S0000166	no story about blue apron could be called complete without sampling the product so i ordered up a box and paid for it mind you
POD1000000004_S0000171	which according to the blue apron recipe was supposed to quote lend even more savory flavor to my dish yum
POD1000000004_S0000183	0 hanna no get your hand out of the garbage disposal
POD1000000004_S0000198	that one was not as exciting by then i understood the gimmick and the excitement of discovery kind of fizzled in this way i am not too different from a lot of people who try blue apron says professor dan mccarthy
POD1000000004_S0000206	but none of this marketing resulted in a huge new customer haul and that says forbes is alex konrad made investors a little less in love with the company
POD1000000004_S0000207	it was hard to make a really attractive you know future facing story for like how blue apron really becomes that huge
POD1000000004_S0000218	soon blue apron co founder and c e 0 matt salzberg seemed pretty upbeat about the whole situation on c n b c
POD1000000004_S0000222	one thing salzberg mentioned in that clip was how his company was tackling a huge market now if you are defining the market as all the people who eat food in america then yeah that is a huge market
POD1000000004_S0000225	that is cara rasch she is a food and beverage analyst with packaged facts
POD1000000004_S0000227	it is hard to gauge but rasch estimates that only about one of the u s population uses home delivery meal kits and she says the market kind of peaked 2 or 3 years ago
POD1000000004_S0000229	remember when we said amazon trademarked its meal kit back in 2017 rasch says the company never did much with it and that is a pretty good indicator that meal kit delivery is not a growing global concern
POD1000000004_S0000232	and there were more problems within a month of the i p 0 co founder matt wadiak stepped down as c 00 matt salzberg then the c e 0 resigned his post shortly thereafter
POD1000000004_S0000235	welcome to trading nation i am eric chemi let us take a look at one of last year is high profile i p os that is getting absolutely smoked we are talking of course about blue apron the stock sinking as much as 4% on friday
POD1000000004_S0000239	the move raised the company is stock price but customers still were not flocking to blue apron is boxes now at this point i would have thrown in the towel but not c e 0 linda findley kozlowski
POD1000000004_S0000240	the company would not make kozlowski available for a chat but here she is last year on c n b c is squawk on the streettalking about how jazzed she is about blue apron is prospects
POD1000000004_S0000242	cool cool cool but also blue apron was thinking about getting down with some strategic alternatives says marketwatch is tonya garcia
POD1000000004_S0000246	in early 2020 blue apron put the word out that it was interested in possibly getting scooped up maybe by a big grocery chain or someone else with deep pockets who wanted to own a meal kit delivery business
POD1000000004_S0000247	at the same time garcia says the company acted like it was in turnaround mode it decided to streamline operations including shutting down its fulfillment center in texas
POD1000000004_S0000260	the pandemic seems like it is given blue apron a decent little boost in the 2nd quarter the company brought in 20000s more subscribers but that is still way below where they were in 2019

POD1000000010_S0000001	in this episode how to raise kind kids and to truly understand kindness anya and i visited a mother who is lived through every parent is worst nightmare
POD1000000010_S0000004	her name is scarlett lewis and before we met her cory i have to confess that i was not necessarily all that impressed with kindness as an idea i mean
POD1000000010_S0000007	but that really really changed for me when we traveled to rural connecticut to spend some time with scarlett
POD1000000010_S0000010	scarlett named this place wild rose farm there a few chickens clucking in a wire coop behind a muddy pasture where there is also a horse
POD1000000010_S0000014	we get there in time to watch her feed the animals including her constant companions 3 dogs remington rocky and olive
POD1000000010_S0000017	so scarlett leads us inside the house and i remember we took our jackets off in the mud room and hanging there was a 1st grader is black and blue ski jacket
POD1000000010_S0000018	and scarlett stopped and she pulled out a pair of these funny looking teeth out of the pocket joke teeth
POD1000000010_S0000023	scarlett is son jesse had these teeth in this coat at sandy hook elementary school the day he died
POD1000000010_S0000024	my name is scarlett lewis and i am the founder of the jesse lewis choose love movement
POD1000000010_S0000026	here in sandy hook connecticut in 2012 scarlett lived through every parent is nightmare
POD1000000010_S0000030	every surface is covered with paintings scarlett is done and photos of jesse and his brother j t
POD1000000010_S0000031	and one of the cabinets has chalkboard paint on it and on it is a message from jesse
POD1000000010_S0000033	scarlett did not notice this message until she returned to the house several days after the shooting to find clothes for jesse to wear in his casket
POD1000000010_S0000040	scarlett says she has no idea how or where her little boy came up with those 3 words
POD1000000010_S0000047	i am anya kamenetz an education reporter and the mother of 2 girls
POD1000000010_S0000048	and i am cory turner an education reporter and the father of 2 boys
POD1000000010_S0000059	so cory yes kindness is important but i guess i always just assumed that my kids would learn it naturally through osmosis
POD1000000010_S0000061	well you know what anya you are not alone in that assumption
POD1000000010_S0000064	that is jennifer kotler she is one of our expert guides today through what turns out to be a pretty complicated subject
POD1000000010_S0000069	exhibit a is this study jen points to out of harvard a few years back
POD1000000010_S0000074	yeah and this kind of like self delusion this is just one of many reasons scarlett worries that this culture is creating huge problems
POD1000000010_S0000077	and of course her life is a really stark reminder cory of just how high the stakes can be when we talk about things like mental health and kids who are troubled
POD1000000010_S0000080	after she read that message from jesse scarlett lewis reached out to a team of researchers and educators and she created a plan to essentially teach children kindness step by step value by value
POD1000000010_S0000081	yeah the jesse lewis choose love enrichment program they estimate it is now reached over a 1000000 students
POD1000000010_S0000085	so let us follow scarlett is lead and sesame street is and talk about how the science of kindness can translate into action
POD1000000010_S0000095	thomas lickona says we see signs of what is called empathic distress even in tiny babies
POD1000000010_S0000098	and tom told us that babies moral sense seems to go even deeper
POD1000000010_S0000100	so this is like i was saying cory i always thought kids are just born to be kind
POD1000000010_S0000103	only about a 3rd of the kids actually responded in that moment with altruism with kindness by say going over to the child offering a hug calling for an adult
POD1000000010_S0000104	zachary
POD1000000010_S0000106	let us check on him bella he is trying to check on you
POD1000000010_S0000109	i am going to help bella
POD1000000010_S0000112	let me help you bella
POD1000000010_S0000138	and that is why scarlett says
POD1000000010_S0000144	the jesse lewis choose love program for kids from pre k through high school actually begins with courage
POD1000000010_S0000145	and i want to mention that reports of the shooting said that jesse himself showed incredible courage
POD1000000010_S0000147	yeah and scarlett is definition of courage is even bigger than that sort of
POD1000000010_S0000154	it is also scarlett says the courage to stand up to someone who is bullying you or someone you know by taking their perspective and seeing the world through their eyes
POD1000000010_S0000160	you know hearing about courage in that way in that moment really spoke to me cory because i have to admit this
POD1000000010_S0000161	i was a little afraid to sit down with scarlett
POD1000000010_S0000165	one really practical way scarlett is choose love plan builds courage is by teaching kids to stay calm
POD1000000010_S0000170	jen kotler at sesame says if you are more aware of your emotions you will also be more aware of everyone else is
POD1000000010_S0000186	yeah before jen started at sesame workshop she spent her days in a classroom
POD1000000010_S0000190	the problem jen found out with forced apologies as that they are usually pretty worthless
POD1000000010_S0000193	yeah so tom lickona and jen kotler both told us instead of focusing on kids parroting the words sorry
POD1000000010_S0000196	jen says you can actually take a moment like this
POD1000000010_S0000200	jen says sesame street has improved over time in how it depicts apologies on the show
POD1000000010_S0000202	so elmo might say i was really wanting to play with my scooter and i did not want to share it
POD1000000010_S0000206	you will get it zoe
POD1000000010_S0000207	but but but wait what about your turn elmo
POD1000000010_S0000208	elmo elmo can be patient and wait for his turn
POD1000000010_S0000209	so what do you say zoe
POD1000000010_S0000214	all right nice job sharing elmo
POD1000000010_S0000228	you hurt amy
POD1000000010_S0000231	tom also says that children should learn to make an apology of action
POD1000000010_S0000236	and scarlett lewis says that means when parents screw up we need to apologize too
POD1000000010_S0000240	if anything scarlett talks even more about the other side of an apology forgiveness
POD1000000010_S0000250	i love this too because scarlett is really focusing on the benefit of letting go of anger
POD1000000010_S0000252	and it was at this point where sitting with scarlett in her kitchen her back is to her refrigerator which is covered with photos of jesse and her other son j t and we just had to ask
POD1000000010_S0000268	aija simmons helps run the social and emotional programs for schools in oakland california
POD1000000010_S0000277	tom lickona says it is not just about celebrating kind actions
POD1000000010_S0000281	yeah part of how scarlett keeps going she told us is by constantly reminding herself even out loud what she is grateful for
POD1000000010_S0000285	and tom agrees
POD1000000010_S0000302	that is a great point cory i have got to try that
POD1000000010_S0000306	yeah in fact scarlett lewis says
POD1000000010_S0000308	and similarly tom says kindness as a virtue is not random it is a habit
POD1000000010_S0000313	so tom says you know not for an allowance but just to give the message that this is what we do to help out because we are part of something bigger
POD1000000010_S0000314	and for my daughter lulu who is 7 that chore ah really is taking care of the cat
POD1000000010_S0000322	and here is the really good news tom told us
POD1000000010_S0000327	and that is why he says we are happier when we are helping and jen at sesame agrees
POD1000000010_S0000329	and that is why scarlett says we should talk to kids directly about this helper is high
POD1000000010_S0000346	time for a recap anya
POD1000000010_S0000360	the kind of courage to see the world the way scarlett lewis does

POD1000000017_S0000003	this week wesley morris on the birth of american music
POD1000000017_S0000005	so last fall i am at my friend is house we are making dinner i am chopping vegetables and i asked my friend brett who was cooking with me can you put on some music
POD1000000017_S0000009	at some point brett has to go run an errand i think i might have sent him on one i do not remember but he has gone so i am alone just me with the vegetables and the yacht rock
POD1000000017_S0000019	steal away by robbie dupree
POD1000000017_S0000031	i am hearing things like rosanna by toto
POD1000000017_S0000041	there is something jazz like in the syncopated music of something like steely dan
POD1000000017_S0000043	you can hear in somebody like michael mcdonald
POD1000000017_S0000049	and the song in which i am hearing it the deepest and strongest and most powerfully at least to me standing in that kitchen chopping those vegetables was when kenny loggins is this is it comes on
POD1000000017_S0000053	sure kenny loggins is basically sing whispering the verses in this song
POD1000000017_S0000058	and then in the pre chorus kenny loggins disappears and who shows up michael mcdonald
POD1000000017_S0000060	giving kenny loggins plenty of time to gather himself
POD1000000017_S0000066	scraping the pan is the blackest thing you can do as a singer and here is kenny loggins as this white artist doing it
POD1000000017_S0000078	i am thinking about amy winehouse
POD1000000017_S0000080	i am thinking about annie lennox
POD1000000017_S0000082	i am thinking about george michael
POD1000000017_S0000084	i think about chris stapleton
POD1000000017_S0000087	and one of the many phases in which david bowie really wanted to make r and b and soul music
POD1000000017_S0000089	this is the sound not just of black america but the sound of america it is deeply american almost especially when it is sung by british people like david bowie and annie lennox and amy winehouse
POD1000000017_S0000103	and then you have someone like billy mccrea
POD1000000017_S0000114	it is what you would have heard passing a black person doing his job entertaining himself doing the drudgery of work the way a guy named thomas dartmouth rice did sometime around the 1830s
POD1000000017_S0000116	one day he is touring with a troupe in cincinnati or maybe it was pittsburgh we do not really know but the myth basically goes t d rice happened upon an old black man cleaning a horse in a stable
POD1000000017_S0000117	the man was doing his job on property owned by a white man named crow
POD1000000017_S0000122	whatever rice hears coming out of this man is mouth is captivating to him and what he sees is an opportunity
POD1000000017_S0000133	and so when t d rice hears this black man singing this song and moving his body in this particular way ding a light bulb goes off
POD1000000017_S0000140	come listen all you gals and boys i am just from tuckahoe i am going to sing a little song my name is jim crow
POD1000000017_S0000142	and the lyrics give the horse groomer a name and the name is jim crow
POD1000000017_S0000146	this is the 1st time a paying audience is basically electrified by a white man with a black face this is the night that jim crow was allegedly introduced to america this mascot of american racism
POD1000000017_S0000148	and here is thomas dartmouth rice giving it to them this is the night that american popular culture was born
POD1000000017_S0000151	so you have other minstrel acts who come along and try to do what thomas dartmouth rice is doing a song and a dance
POD1000000017_S0000175	some of those people having these dreams go on to become people like stephen foster
POD1000000017_S0000177	stephen foster the man widely credited as being the father of american music
POD1000000017_S0000197	f e miller and scatman crothers
POD1000000017_S0000210	d w griffith is the birth of a nation full of white men villainously in blackface
POD1000000017_S0000220	judy garland performed in blackface
POD1000000017_S0000222	bing crosby and fred astaire both performed in blackface
POD1000000017_S0000227	out of these recordings you have people like muddy waters
POD1000000017_S0000237	you have the advent of a place like blue note records where lots of amazing jazz was created and then released into the world people like sidney bechet
POD1000000017_S0000239	and then louis armstrong
POD1000000017_S0000241	and duke ellington
POD1000000018_S0000000	when andy griffith passed away in 2012 c n n covered his death off and on the entire day
POD1000000018_S0000003	larry king is one of the people who called in to talk that day he would had andy on his various shows numerous times and he mentioned something in passing that is really interesting
POD1000000018_S0000005	what larry said is that a lawyer named percy foreman was the man who inspired the character matlock
POD1000000018_S0000007	this was a weird thing for anyone to say because most people even today believe that character to be based on a different lawyer named bobby lee cook
POD1000000018_S0000009	however in 20153 years after larry king said something that most people would assume was incorrect the creator of matlock did confirm that the character was based on percy foreman
POD1000000018_S0000012	percy was able to achieve this record by being an incredible lawyer no denying it but also due to the texas court system is practice of using juries to determine guilt as well as sentencing in the case of a guilty verdict

POD1000000018_S0000019	foreman called it misdemeanor murder that is where a jury might convict you of ending another person is life and send you on your way with the type of punishment you would receive for a misdemeanor crime
POD1000000018_S0000021	percy foreman had such a long run of wins with this strategy that it is still being used in texas today people who have conversations about this sort of thing will sometimes refer to it as the texas defense
POD1000000018_S0000023	now jim denny was not from texas he was from tennessee
POD1000000018_S0000025	when a 16 year old jim denny got hired to work the mailroom of w s m radio is parent company he must have seen it as an opportunity to make something out of himself
POD1000000018_S0000027	denny got this job in 1927 that year the young radio program w s m barn dance was referred to as the grand ole opry for the 1st time on air
POD1000000018_S0000029	every time an odd job came up at the opry jim would take it so he could hang out backstage see the artists and see how the show was made
POD1000000018_S0000030	within 20 years denny had worked his way up to director of the artists service bureau at w s m which meant he was in charge of booking the acts on the opry
POD1000000018_S0000032	there is a few funny things from jim denny is time at the grand ole opry like the one about elvis presley is big debut
POD1000000018_S0000033	elvis was still a teenager when denny did sam phillips the favor of letting elvis come on the show to play his not country arrangement of blue moon of kentucky
POD1000000018_S0000035	it did not go well denny is rumored who have told elvis backstage you aint going nowhere son you ought to go back to driving a truck
POD1000000018_S0000037	denny is also the guy who fired hank williams over the telephone and there is the time when jim made johnny cash wait outside his office for 2 hours before letting him in to ask why cash should be allowed to play on the opry
POD1000000018_S0000039	cash mentioned that he presently had a song called i walk the line in the top 10
POD1000000018_S0000041	jim denny was what many people referred to in those times as a hard man today i think they would have some different words for him and that is why ernest tubb tried to shoot him in 1957
POD1000000018_S0000044	my name is tyler mahan coy i heard the stories my whole life
POD1000000018_S0000047	it is shocking to hear ernest tubb is name associated with any kind of violence whatsoever
POD1000000018_S0000051	crisp texas is a ghost town now ernest tubb was born there in 1914 into a family of sharecroppers like most sharecroppers children ernest grew up working on farms all over the area
POD1000000018_S0000054	like a great number of artists we will learn about in future episodes it was all over for a 14 year old ernest tubb the 1st time he heard jimmie rodgers sing
POD1000000018_S0000058	hearing jimmie rodgers is what led ernest tubb to decide he simply had to become a country singer
POD1000000018_S0000059	it is also very specifically what caused him 3 decades later to want to shoot a 357 magnum at jim denny
POD1000000018_S0000062	the death of his idol was extremely upsetting for ernest however it also made him realize that he was going to have to get serious about chasing his dreams
POD1000000018_S0000067	holding down 3 jobs at once was necessary to support himself and his young wife elaine they did not waste any time before starting to have kids either
POD1000000018_S0000069	ernest was more than happy to work hard if it kept him moving toward the life of his hero jimmie rodgers
POD1000000018_S0000070	he would had this small picture of jimmie for years now and it was in pretty bad shape so he got a phone book and looked up the number for jimmie rodger is widow carrie
POD1000000018_S0000071	he called her on the phone to explain that he was such a big fan and to see if she happened to have a bigger better photo of jimmie that ernest could have maybe even one that was autographed
POD1000000018_S0000072	carrie was super nice and she did have such a photo that ernest could have and went so far as to invite him out to her house in kerrville texas to get the picture
POD1000000018_S0000073	ernest drove out there the next sunday he was not working taking elaine and their baby justin on the trip
POD1000000018_S0000075	they would planned to stay for maybe 10 minutes and ended up hanging out for over 2 hours looking at costumes guitars and pictures brought out by missus rodgers hearing her stories about how high on the hog they would lived merely a few years earlier
POD1000000018_S0000076	e t could never have guessed when he woke up that morning that he would be laying down to sleep that night having held jimmie rodgers signature martin acoustic guitar with jimmie is name inlaid in pearl across the fretboard and the word thanks written on the back upside down
POD1000000018_S0000080	okay now add this on top of that a few months later carrie rodgers called ernest to say she would listened for his radio show as he would asked for her to do
POD1000000018_S0000082	on the other hand she did not think he sounded like jimmie rodgers when he sang which is basically the only thing in the world ernest tubb wanted to do in this phase of his life
POD1000000018_S0000085	anyway she still hooked e t up with elsie mcwilliams the writer of a few great jimmie rodgers songs
POD1000000018_S0000086	ernest tubb made a couple of records that did not sell very well did some touring and ended up back home doing low paying radio again and working 2 or 3 side jobs like before driving around a beer truck was one of them
POD1000000018_S0000088	after a while back at home ernest had to have his tonsils taken out he would later say the doctors told him not to sing or yodel for a while after the surgery but he did not listen
POD1000000018_S0000093	ernest held a self deprecating sense of humor about his own voice for the rest of his life he loved to say that 9 out of 10 guys sitting in bars around the country could sing better than he could
POD1000000018_S0000094	i do not know if he really believed that it is always been strange to me i think george jones indisputably the greatest country singer in history is exactly what happens when you add ernest tubb is new singing style and roy acuff is voice together
POD1000000018_S0000096	you just heard some ernest here is a little roy acuff from 1942
POD1000000018_S0000098	now george junde would have told you hank williams was his favorite singer you do not get hank without ernest and roy i have seen lefty frizzell named as an influence on george
POD1000000018_S0000099	lefty borrowed from ernest as well however you want to say we got to george jones it always comes back to roy acuff and ernest tubb
POD1000000018_S0000100	now the part of ernest you can hear in george is the tendency to hold on to a note for longer than you would expect picking the melody up and putting it back down in ways that are impossible to predict when hearing them sing a song for the 1st time
POD1000000018_S0000106	it is possible ernest really did not like his new voice about a 1000000 people disagree with his opinion he had that tonsillectomy in 1939
POD1000000018_S0000107	in 1940 he had his biggest hit walking the floor over you this song is still synonymous with the name ernest tubb
POD1000000018_S0000108	if someone only knows one ernest tubb song it is usually this song
POD1000000018_S0000111	the texas troubadour ernest tubb
POD1000000018_S0000115	tubb would stay working for the rest of his life so members of the texas troubadours would be replaced every now and then
POD1000000018_S0000116	buddy emmons jack greene billy byrd leon rhodes and cal smith are only some of the notable players who joined the band on their way up the ladder
POD1000000018_S0000118	this was the 1st way ernest found to extend a helping hand to younger musicians like the hand carrie rodgers had held out to him
POD1000000018_S0000123	and so he started calling their names out when they get took a course but he was never jealous of anybody in his band outshining him you did you know he did not mind that at all as he proved with jack greene and cal smith and
POD1000000018_S0000124	ah and because he had the wilburns with him for a while and skeeter worked some dates with him george jones stonewall jackson and he was always pushing them and he like roy i think understood that the bigger they became the bigger he became
POD1000000018_S0000125	george jones and stonewall jackson were never texas troubadours justin meant e t took those guys out on tour with him as opening acts to help them build their own following and often he did a lot more than that
POD1000000018_S0000127	johnny paid check
POD1000000018_S0000129	ah ernest one time i was hanging around the streets and it was snowing and buddy emmons took me on to meet him he always wants me to meet him
POD1000000018_S0000131	and evidently buddy had told him that
POD1000000018_S0000138	you can not tell the hank snow story without talking about ernest tubb e t told johnny cash not to smile when he performed folsom prison blues so people in the audience could really feel the song
POD1000000018_S0000139	cash never forgot the advice hank williams senior was heavily influenced by ernest is music and ernest is the one who convinced the grand ole opry to bring hank back after his 1st failed audition
POD1000000018_S0000140	e t got hank to promise he would not touch any booze for 3 months to swing that one
POD1000000018_S0000141	in 1947 enough radio listeners wrote letters complaining of not being able to find his music that he launched the ernest tubb record shop in nashville if you could not make it there in person they would ship records directly to you
POD1000000018_S0000144	the record shop operated at a loss of $10000 a year for the 1st 2 years it was open but ernest knew how important it was and he kept it alive
POD1000000018_S0000147	ernest played host to opry stars and newcomers alike making sure to remind you this music was available for mail order from ernest tubb is record shop he took the chance to keep jimmie rodgers memory alive pitching his records as well
POD1000000018_S0000149	ernest never grew out of his fascination with jimmie rodgers and never stopped repaying his debt to jimmie is widow carrie jimmie is death had left carrie in a pretty bad financial situation but she still got money from the sales of his records which were declining
POD1000000018_S0000150	he realized the more jimmie rodgers records sold the better off carrie would be so e t pushed those records as hard as he could
POD1000000018_S0000151	carrie loaned and eventually flat out gave him that guitar of jimmie is which is why you will frequently see pictures or videos of ernest tubb playing a guitar that says jimmie rodgers on it
POD1000000018_S0000152	in 1953 ernest helped found the jimmie rodgers memorial festival in rodgers hometown of meridian mississippi that is a stand up guy
POD1000000018_S0000154	you can find plenty of people who will say the same thing about jim denny
POD1000000018_S0000155	remember jim poor kid from tennessee worked his way up from the mailroom to become director of artists services at w s m and manager of the grand ole opry
POD1000000018_S0000157	denny was a powerful man in nashville and he acted like he knew it
POD1000000018_S0000158	where ernest tubb built a reputation for helping young musicians jim denny had a reputation for acting like a dick
POD1000000018_S0000160	the johnny cash e t gave advice to is the same johnny cash who had to wait 2 hours outside denny is office
POD1000000018_S0000162	jim denny might not have been a dick he could have simply been a businessman who paid more attention to the bottom line than how many friends he had
POD1000000018_S0000163	denny is the guy who had to be convinced to let hank senior onto the opry and he is the guy who called hank to fire him over the telephone but ernest tubb was standing in denny is office when that phone call was made
POD1000000018_S0000164	he said he saw tears in jim is eyes
POD1000000018_S0000165	hank had missed a scheduled opry appearance most likely for no good reason other than that he was drunk denny said he thought firing hank would make him realize he needed to get his act together
POD1000000018_S0000166	that is not what happened hank williams died 4 months after being dismissed from the opry it is tragic but you can see how jim denny thought he was doing the right thing in that situation
POD1000000018_S0000167	this is important to recognize because the year hank williams died is the same year that jim denny formed cedarwood publishing with webb pierce
POD1000000018_S0000172	roy acuff and fred rose had started acuff rose music back in 1942
POD1000000018_S0000174	they were the best game in town until jim denny formed cedarwood in 53
POD1000000018_S0000175	as head of artists services at w s m and manager of the grand ole opry jim denny controlled who got to play on the opry their place in the lineup and how long they got to play
POD1000000018_S0000178	if jim denny owns a country music publishing firm while retaining singular control of the most popular country music radio program in america then he is essentially printing his own money
POD1000000018_S0000181	if the writer does not want to be a performer congratulations webb pierce is the biggest star on the opry and he is playing your song on the grand ole opry tonight
POD1000000018_S0000182	roy acuff was pissed off and he did not stay quiet about it he said denny was giving the best bounce to his own artist artists signed to acuff rose had a tendency to see roy is point
POD1000000018_S0000183	artists signed to cedarwood had a tendency to think jim denny was not doing anything wrong weird huh
POD1000000018_S0000184	long story short in 1956 w s m fired jim denny over his conflicts of interest
POD1000000018_S0000186	he started a booking agency and signed most of the opry artists some of whom had resigned when denny was fired then denny contacted the philip morris tobacco company
POD1000000018_S0000188	so when jim denny called with a chance for them to get their product associated with all those acts philip morris wrote a check big enough to fund the biggest country music package tour anyone had ever seen
POD1000000018_S0000191	it looked as though everyone was getting what they wanted until the philip morris country music show booked a stop in meridian mississippi on the same week as the 5th annual jimmie rodgers memorial festival
POD1000000018_S0000194	for 5 years ernest tubb had worked to grow the jimmie rodgers festival from scratch this is a tremendously difficult thing to do e t put in the effort to honor his idol
POD1000000018_S0000196	jim denny was not simply setting up shop across the street with some healthy competition
POD1000000018_S0000197	he brought a free show to town on the same night with half the grand ole opry lineup and several big names you would have had to buy a ticket to see on the jimmie rodgers event the previous night
POD1000000018_S0000199	it would crush bonnaroo this was such a big deal that they did not even have the jimmie rodgers memorial festival the following year
POD1000000018_S0000200	they regrouped to put one on again in 1959 but carrie rodgers health had already taken a turn for the worse and ernest tubb was never involved with the festival again
POD1000000018_S0000205	according to billy byrd ernest tubb is reaction to the philip morris country music show undercutting the jimmie rodgers memorial festival was to get drunk and stay drunk for the better part of a week
POD1000000018_S0000206	they carted him back to nashville but he was still drinking and he was still mad as hell at jim denny
POD1000000018_S0000207	finally he called denny at home in the middle of the night to cuss him out denny said something like well if you are so mad about it then how about you just meet me down at w s m right now and we will settle things for good
POD1000000018_S0000209	that sounded like a great plan to ernest tubb he strapped on a gun belt with bullets and 357 magnum in the holster and drove downtown in his cadillac wearing house slippers
POD1000000018_S0000210	meanwhile when jim denny had hung up the phone he simply took it back off the hook again so ernest could not call him anymore and then went back to sleep
POD1000000018_S0000212	so ernest tubb is drunk off his ass with a loaded gun when he stumbles into the lobby of the national life building where w s m was located
POD1000000018_S0000217	bill williams the news director at w s m says he was walking in to work when a gunshot rang out in the lobby and a bullet went over his head into the wall
POD1000000018_S0000218	he turned around you know pretty scared and saw ernest tubb standing there in his house slippers with a revolver
POD1000000018_S0000220	when he asked ernest what the hell he was doing ernest said my god i have shot the wrong man
POD1000000018_S0000221	whether or not he had been actively trying to kill anyone we will never know for certain it seems to me like he thought he had successfully shot someone and was only upset that someone was not jim denny
POD1000000018_S0000222	either way ernest settled down after thinking he would shot an innocent person bill williams called his boss jack dewitt to tell him what happened jack told bill to take ernest home
POD1000000018_S0000225	ernest tubb went to jail for drunk and disorderly plus carrying the weapon
POD1000000018_S0000227	so ernest bought cigarettes for all the other inmates and sang songs with them while bill williams waited to take him home
POD1000000018_S0000231	jim denny is name was kept out of the papers though everyone in the business could read between the lines and see who ernest had wanted to shoot
POD1000000018_S0000233	the incident seems to have had no effect on ernest is career whatsoever apparently if all e t was trying to do was put a bullet in jim denny then that was fine
POD1000000018_S0000236	in 1984 his lungs killed him just like his hero jimmie rodgers
POD1000000018_S0000238	the midnite jamboree still airs every saturday night and you can still buy music from ernest tubb is record shop or online at e t record shop dot com
POD1000000018_S0000240	we are told that in 1963 ernest tubb made up with jim denny before jim passed away from cancer the jim denny artist bureau stayed in business for only a few more years
POD1000000018_S0000242	jim denny was inducted to the country music hall of fame in 1966 cedarwood jim denny is publishing company was sold to mel tillis in 1983
POD1000000018_S0000243	ernest tubb had been inducted to the country music hall of fame in 1965 while he was still alive
POD1000000018_S0000247	ah be nice every episode of cocaine and rhinestones is written and produced by me tyler mahan coe
POD1000000018_S0000252	okay 1st of all if i did not make it clear it is impossible to overstate ernest tubb importance to country music
POD1000000018_S0000254	if you want to call it a honky tonk and it happened after ernest tubb it was influenced by ernest tubb before i get to the story and episode i would like to address one other thing
POD1000000018_S0000255	in the 1980s clyde moody try to start an alternative association to the country music hall of fame called the country music pioneer association
POD1000000018_S0000256	the c m p a had a trashy newspaper that clyde essentially used to rant against the industry and print whatever shitty rumors people sent in
POD1000000018_S0000257	among these rumors was one that ernest tubb died broke and alone in a cheap downtown motel shunned by the country music world he done so much to help
POD1000000018_S0000259	charlie louvin even has it in his autobiography which is not the only thing charlie got wrong in that book but i will talk about that another time
POD1000000018_S0000260	1st of all the source was ernest tubb is estranged wife next ernest died owning 70% of the ernest tubb record shop which had multiple locations running and was very profitable at that time he was not a broke man
POD1000000018_S0000262	i believe ernest chose to turn visitors away because he was wasting away is emphysema and did not want anyone who loved him to have that as their last memory of him
POD1000000018_S0000265	and i think justin said that people would go will try to see earnest and he would tell justin to tell them thank you but he would rather not have the company
POD1000000018_S0000266	so you know i mean the end i i do not think that ernest tubb died you know and it is sad state of affairs i think that he did
POD1000000018_S0000268	i think he did a lot for the country music and i think he went out of way that he wanted to go at it seems like to me okay back to ernest tubb and jim denny
POD1000000018_S0000269	what what about this story right is was that crazy it is just so many things like the the roots of country music are just growing all over this story you know you got jim denny showing up right as the grand ole opry is becoming a thing
POD1000000018_S0000270	ernest tubb gets in there and his throat is broken so he can not do what he wanted to do is whole life which is imitate his hero
POD1000000018_S0000271	and his throat gets broken and so now he has got a create this new thing and he ends up influencing fucking hank williams senior and like everyone that is that is crazy it is amazing i love the story
POD1000000018_S0000273	at least the part about ernest tubb getting drunk and going down to the radio station with a gun and shooting them firing off around to the wall you know
POD1000000018_S0000274	if people always bring that up as an example of how wild and crazy these old guys were everybody laughs about ernest getting hauled off to jail and ultimately getting away with causing a little bit of trouble you know boys will be boys
POD1000000018_S0000276	thanks to ronnie pues very well done biography on ernest tubb ah that finally had the story for me and the big jimmie rodgers festival thing why that affect it early so deeply that was in there
POD1000000018_S0000277	the most detailed account of bill william is version of the lobby shooting was in there
POD1000000018_S0000278	i went with bills version because a he was the news director of w s n with a reputation for being able to throw away that day is new script and add lib the news without making a mistake
POD1000000018_S0000279	and b he was the one right in the middle of it you know he called his boss at home he went with ernest to the jail a shout out jim varney everyone else just seemed like a bystander trying to get their name involved you know
POD1000000018_S0000280	like a security guard saying that he told the ernest to put the gun away and ernest fired at off to dare the security guard or whatever you know i mean
POD1000000018_S0000282	also i am aware there are you know different revisionist history type opinions about how well elvis presley is debut on the grand ole opry did or did not go
POD1000000018_S0000285	ah i have seen every year from 1924 to 1929 cited as the year of danny being hired at the parent company of w s m that insurance company the life insurance company ah i do not really care what year he you know exactly was a see
POD1000000018_S0000286	there was a biography of johnny cash that quoted a rolling stone interview with johnny talking about jim denny making him wait outside his office for 2 hours
POD1000000018_S0000287	ah elyria jordan biography on jim reeves had a bunch of great information on the jim dandy opry scandal i found a billboard magazine from 1956 reporting that philip morris paid over $400000 for the talent on that 1st package tour
POD1000000018_S0000291	ah i am going to say this guy is last name wrong craig haver herz harvey herz i do not know he wrote a book on the history of w s m called
POD1000000018_S0000294	i know i am going to keep coming back to this book for future episodes a lot of when i got out of that for this was about denny is firing because pretty much everywhere else you hear people talk about denny getting fired
POD1000000018_S0000295	they are all like yeah i do not know it was just like weird no one really knows why he got fired or you got artists who were with cedar wood saying jim dandy got railroaded
POD1000000018_S0000296	you have got artists who were with a cuff rose and denny was corrupted and he had to get out of there you know so this w s m book was really good just to find out straight up what happened
POD1000000018_S0000298	i mentioned that hank senior was heavily influenced by ernest tubb but also some of the most charming stuff i ever read about hank is the way he acted around ernest
POD1000000018_S0000299	you know they were peers they were contemporaries it hank was influenced by him but then he you know got to come to the show

POD1000000022_S0000004	maybe you do not sit around poised waiting to make other people aware of some bad thing that happened to you in the past well enough of that crazy talk get off the bench cause your uncle steve is putting you in the game i am here to tell you do not worry my friend you are a victim you really are
POD1000000022_S0000012	and at the time of sartre for over 300 years people had been pointing out how many of the ways we look at things in the western world are largely derivative from the way christianity describes being a human being
POD1000000022_S0000023	that a reasonable expectation to have when navigating your life is that one day you are going to wake up and there is going to be some event some miracle that you witness some transcendent moment where you realize the divinity of jesus
POD1000000022_S0000030	maybe for some of you out there there is only one other person in this entire world that has full access to your true self hidden deep within you but sartre would say is this really how the self works
POD1000000022_S0000031	is the self really like the christian soul hidden somewhere deep within you that only you have access to sartre would say it very well may be that you put on a mask when you go out in public for the sake of pragmatism and it very well may be that you have reflected on yourself
POD1000000022_S0000033	this concept is a common one in existentialism it is actually one of the main themes in dostoyevsky is book crime and punishment the idea that you know we often think we know a lot more about ourselves than we actually do in practice 2 examples of this
POD1000000022_S0000036	that guy now this man believes beyond a shadow of a doubt that he is napoleon if you set him down and then asked him candidly no but who are you really deep down inside he would say i am napoleon bonaparte commander of the armies of the north
POD1000000022_S0000037	husband to a murdered wife father to a murdered son and i will have my vengeance but is this man really napoleon we know he is not napoleon in fact in a weird way as outsiders we seem to have an advantage when it comes to knowing who he really is
POD1000000022_S0000040	i am going to the sporting goods section i may i am going to go up into the rafters like i am tom cruise and snap the dude is neck i am going to do this because that is just the kind of person i am that is me i would sacrifice my life for the greater good now he may tell his friends this
POD1000000022_S0000044	sartre says that when you take a closer look at the self it is not a soul it is not a personality hidden deep within you what we are referencing when we talk about the self turns out to be much more complex than that with me more moving parts
POD1000000022_S0000045	and i think a good place to begin if we want to understand sartre is views on what the self really is is to talk about 2 foundational aspects of what it means to be a human being that to sartre seem to be constantly intertwined and dependent upon each other what he calls our facticity
POD1000000022_S0000048	fully affirmative and being for itself as being consciousness or the source of all negation well one day when sartre is trying to meet his monthly quota for obscure sounding philosophical descriptions the way he describes the relationship between these 2 ontological categories is that being in itself
POD1000000022_S0000049	quote is what it is and being for itself quote is what it is not well as weird as that sounds in a vacuum after listening to last episode we all know what he means when he says it but then sartre points out something very mysterious a very strange coincidence
POD1000000022_S0000050	when you look at the relationship between these 2 ontological categories 2 things that are easy to write off as just these meaningless abstract concepts that sartre cooked up one day when you look at how being in itself and being for itself relate to each other
POD1000000022_S0000051	sartre notices there seems to be a similar sort of relationship at the foundation of who we are as people see because on one hand all of us have our facticity and facticity is kind of like being in itself it is the fully affirmative set of facts that are true about us
POD1000000022_S0000053	i i i am scared of spiders things like that right in other words statements of facts that are currently true about us that is what makes up our facticity but what sartre would want us to consider is that while these kinds of statements are no doubt useful when it comes to describing certain pieces of who i am
POD1000000022_S0000058	you can start to hear the weird sartre description creeping in there just like being in itself is what it is and being for itself is what it is not in a sense i am what i am i have a facticity but i also am what i am not yet
POD1000000022_S0000066	when sartre talks about radical freedom when any of us talk about being individuals that are free to act as they choose we are never talking about total freedom right it is always freedom within certain limitations
POD1000000022_S0000072	but yeah ultimately the point sartre is making here with the concepts of facticity and transcendenceis it is not only to stop thinking about your self as though it is this artifact hidden deep within you inside of a vault but also stop thinking about who you are as though it is this static
POD1000000022_S0000075	unless if you are dead you have never arrived at a destination as a human being now at 1st glance this may seem like sartre is writing a self help book no no single fact about you sums up who you are release your inner transcendence no
POD1000000022_S0000076	no like we touched on last time sartre thinks that when people are truly faced with the number of these possibilities are free to choose from most of the time they do not get excited they are horrified by it in fact most of the time once people realize this stuff
POD1000000022_S0000077	sartre thinks that the secret covert desire of everyone whether they realize it or not is to escape this duality it is to turn themselves into either pure facticity or pure transcendence or as sartre says we all secretly want to become god
POD1000000022_S0000080	god is perfect as he is pure facticity but on the other hand god is all powerful and capable of bringing about any possibility he wants in other words pure transcendence sartre would say this is no coincidence
POD1000000022_S0000083	or pure transcendence like god is what sartre calls bad faith let us take a look at the most famous example of bad faith that sartre lays out because we already talked about it in the other episode i will keep it brief
POD1000000022_S0000084	sartre talks about sitting in the middle of a cafe in paris watching a waiter as he does his job then you can imagine a waiter in the 1940s right dressed up in his little outfit very upright good posture very proper
POD1000000022_S0000085	he holds the tray in a particular way he walks and changes direction in a very militaristic particular way like a good waiter does sartre can not help but point out that this guy does not seem to be a self with facticity and transcendence in this moment
POD1000000022_S0000087	go to most restaurants and you can find some modern version of what sartre is talking about here i mean there is so many servers out there that have fallen into bad faith and are just sort of playing the role of the same person it seems to be a modern archetype of what it is to be a server they all say the same stuff
POD1000000022_S0000088	hi i am john i am going to be taking care you today can i get you guys started with a bottomless bucket of shrimp or some drinks or something but it is at every stage of the meal how is everything tasting for you guys you all save room for desert there is absolutely no rush i am going to leave the check here i am going to go over there
POD1000000022_S0000090	ask yourself is this the way this guy talks to his mom is this the way he talks to his best friends no he is fallen into bad faith and is just playing the part of a server now the point sartre is making is not that waiters need to be more creative it is not about waiters
POD1000000022_S0000091	sartre thinks that as human beings we have a tendency to gravitate towards this trap in all aspects of our life we make proclamations about what we are all the time i am a stay at home mom that is my identity
POD1000000022_S0000094	and we use bad faith to quell this feeling of nausea we are constantly doing this with ourselves now if all you ever read was sartre is being and nothingness you might get the read from the book that this tendency we have to gravitate towards bad faith
POD1000000022_S0000096	but in one of the footnotes of being and nothingness sartre alludes to a way out of all of it and perhaps to an ethics that he would write later on in this life well he never writes an ethics and it may be because you know his lifelong partner
POD1000000022_S0000097	and fellow existentialist simone de beauvoir produces what many consider to be the greatest existentialist approach to ethics called the ethics of ambiguity next episode is part 2 once simone de beauvoir so we are going to be talking all about it but enough of bad faith let us get back to answering this question who am i
POD1000000022_S0000100	sartre would say you do not have some privileged v i p access to the facts that are true about you and the possibilities that you have i mean hypothetically any other person if they were diligent enough has access to your facticity and transcendence
POD1000000022_S0000101	in fact just like the guy that tells himself that he is napoleon sometimes other people are better at telling us who we are than we are but how is this possible the reason it is possible is because the self is not the christian soul to sartre
POD1000000022_S0000104	no we tell ourselves stories all the time what follows from this is that the true measure of your values the true measure of who you are is what you actually do it is the collection of what you have actually done thus far in your life and sartre says that when you stop looking at the self
POD1000000022_S0000107	and nothingness that sartre lays out his 3rd ontological category what he calls being for others let us talk about what he means sartre would say that an intrinsic part of what it is to be you is existing alongside other people and all of the consequences that come along with that
POD1000000022_S0000108	this is sartre is concept of being for others now how does being for others affect my answer to the question who am i well again this concept of the self is outside of us it is an abstraction
POD1000000022_S0000109	and what sartre points out is that there are many aspects about who we are that are given to us by other people for example whether we are trustworthy or not whether or not you are a trustworthy person is an aspect of who you are that is mediated by other people right
POD1000000022_S0000111	and how other people view us seem to be connected to sartre but the flip side of it being that interconnected is that it leaves us an what he subscribes is a a perpetual state of being judged by the people around us
POD1000000022_S0000114	you will henceforth be known as the weird shoes guy in that person is mind this is constantly going on but sartre is not saying it is always bad that being around other people is some paranoid everybody is thinking bad things about me all the time thing
POD1000000022_S0000115	people very well may be thinking really good things about you all the time the point that sartre wants to make is that this whole dynamic this dynamic of other people seeing you putting you on trial and turning you into pure facticity in their minds this is going on all the time
POD1000000022_S0000121	it may seem to us like we have a sort of special access to knowing who we are and that we choose to share ourselves with only our closest friends we trust early but sartre would say that the reason it seems that way is cause what you actually have is a narrative about yourself
POD1000000022_S0000124	is because that is the very criteria we all use to choose who our friends are going to be is whether or not they reinforce this picture that we have for ourselves that is what we like about our friends to sartre
POD1000000022_S0000125	for example if a big part of the way that you view yourself in your identity is that you consider yourself to be a smart person sartre would predict that most of your friends are going to be people that are not so smart that tell you that you are smart all the time
POD1000000022_S0000126	or people that ask you a lot of questions that you then answer making you feel smart or other smart people that commend you on being smart like them to sartre we choose our friends because they reinforce the way that we view ourselves
POD1000000022_S0000128	and of course it is going to feel validating of course it would seem that you know better than anyone else who you are but again sartre would say that the true measure of your values the true answer to the question who are you
POD1000000025_S0000006	i am daveed diggs
POD1000000025_S0000007	i am rafael casal
POD1000000025_S0000010	it is a little hard to summarize the partnership between daveed and raphael because as best friends and creative collaborators they have done so much over the years together
POD1000000025_S0000011	let me start individually daveed diggs won a tony and a grammy for his performance in hamilton
POD1000000025_S0000012	he played thomas jefferson and the marquis de lafayette in the original broadway cast

POD1000000025_S0000017	and president obama named it one of his favorite movies of the year
POD1000000025_S0000018	blindspotting takes place in oakland which is also where daveed and rafael are from
POD1000000025_S0000019	their story begins at berkeley high school here is daveed
POD1000000025_S0000024	my memory of him in high school is like diggs always had like a very nonchalant way about him
POD1000000025_S0000025	and i do not know that this paints it accurately but this is a representation of is like at some point diggs was like i am just wearing pajama pants to school every day
POD1000000025_S0000045	and so our friend justin was like you guys should work together you are 2 of my favorite rappers
POD1000000025_S0000075	i do not have the technical skill set that rafa has so like he was so fast in pro tools
POD1000000025_S0000095	this is also great listen now he says we this was really rafa was known right
POD1000000025_S0000098	he got named one of those but rafa never would take that for himself and it was always like us
POD1000000025_S0000116	they did not understand diggs very much at all i feel like the more commercial bay areas scene
POD1000000025_S0000124	we were slumming it so hard and we got to l a we were so poor diggs was delivering tacos
POD1000000025_S0000129	and we did 5 years in l a before diggs went to new york to do hamilton
POD1000000025_S0000130	i think that was one of those things that came about for diggs really organically
POD1000000025_S0000131	hamilton was such an interesting like must like it was a play it was like legit written for him to flex all the things he is good at
POD1000000025_S0000134	and the world saw diggs in the light that best showed everything and they not only accepted but obsessed over it
POD1000000025_S0000136	and the 1st thing that happened is this girl grabs my arm and looks at diggs and goes 0 my god is that daveed diggs to me
POD1000000025_S0000137	and i like start to realize that this woman is anne hathaway like and she is like fan girling out
POD1000000025_S0000140	rafa is like calling and texting and emailing and i am like getting back to the degree that i can
POD1000000025_S0000142	and i remember like somebody turned to diggs and i was like i am thinking about moving to new york so you will respond more in person
POD1000000025_S0000143	i remember diggs goes i did not want to ask
POD1000000025_S0000166	and so i had written this poem about sort of like the numbness of that experience of like god is this like what life is
POD1000000025_S0000170	diggs he finishes this massive sensation in new york he had like 30 days in june that he could shoot this movie
POD1000000025_S0000177	it is just fun in meetings post blindspotting now that we are associated together in this way and also people going to able to see that rafael is a great actor as well as a great writer
POD1000000025_S0000181	the closest i have ever gotten to fighting with rafa i think is like when somebody else i am close to is fighting with rafa right
POD1000000025_S0000189	daveed diggs and rafael casal are partners

POD1000000027_S0000013	for this season we are excited to work with e s p n ramona shelburne one of our top n b a reporters and l a needed and someone who has been covering the story from the moment it broke
POD1000000027_S0000014	ramona is your host for all 5 episodes the quick order of warning this season contains mature subject matter and language and now coming up back the break from 30 for 30 and undefeated the stirring up fears
POD1000000027_S0000016	shelly sterling thought she was just going to return some clothes to neiman marcus when she got in her mercedes benz station wagon and made the drive from malibu to beverly hills it was early in the spring of 2000s and 14
POD1000000027_S0000017	and even though shelly was almost 80 years old she was still going into town as rich people call beverly hills 4 or 5 days a week it is hard to guess shelly is age if you do not know it
POD1000000027_S0000019	there are the iconic brown and yellow signs that let you know you have entered a special place and shelly sterling and her husband donald owned a ton of it
POD1000000027_S0000022	but most people knew her husband donald sterling as the long time owner of the los angeles clippers one of the worst owners in all of sports his team was the laughingstock of the n b a for decades
POD1000000027_S0000023	for shelly it should have been would have been just a jaunt down rodeo drive to return some wildly expensive clothes but unbeknownst to her her husband was also at neiman marcus that day
POD1000000027_S0000024	with a woman 49 years his junior named v stiviano she was not the 1st mistress not even close but v was something different
POD1000000027_S0000026	shelly told me that story when we met in the winter of 2019 at the beverly hills plaza hotel or my hotel as she calls it
POD1000000027_S0000027	shelly was 84 at the time but she can tell that story of that run in with donald and v 5 years earlier with exacting detail
POD1000000027_S0000028	i happened to be there to return something and she was there with donald and with some other friends and we had a big confrontation she was very very very nasty and mean to me
POD1000000027_S0000029	what happened was that she ran into shelly i think at nordstrom and they started talking and i guess things got out of hand
POD1000000027_S0000030	that is v stiviano is lawyer mac nehoray and when i told shelly sterling his version of the story she scoffed
POD1000000027_S0000032	at 1st i thought it was funny that shelly took the time to correct him i mean here is a woman talking to a female reporter about her husband is infidelity who cares whether you confront your husband is mistress outside of neiman marcus or nordys
POD1000000027_S0000034	that in the end led to one of the biggest scandals in professional sports a controversy that forced the n b a to finally deal with donald sterling after decades of his bad behavior and had ripple effects throughout the entire league
POD1000000027_S0000036	this is the sterling affairs from 30 for 30 podcasts and the undefeated i am ramona shelburne
POD1000000027_S0000041	i learned pretty quickly that there is no other owner in basketball with quite the same personality or ego of donald sterling sterling was not a basketball guy he was a personal injury lawyer and then he got filthy rich off of real estate
POD1000000027_S0000047	but rich people like donald sterling multi $1000000000 rich people do not live in the same world as the rest of us do not play by the same rules when you have enough money it is like you are rubber everything just bounces off of you
POD1000000027_S0000048	even 3 decades of driving an n b a franchise into the ground when you are as rich as donald and shelly you get to tell yourself that everything is fabulous
POD1000000027_S0000060	and donald sterling is life was fabulous why would he think otherwise nobody ever questioned him to his face anyway he did whatever he wanted he said whatever he wanted he had relationships with whomever he wanted
POD1000000027_S0000062	i did not know v stiviano back then and yes that is her real name v just the letter v with a period she was born maria vanessa perez
POD1000000027_S0000063	but changed her name to v stiviano at about the same time she would met donald at a super bowl party in 2010 before that she had been trying desperately to climb out of the poverty that she would grown up in
POD1000000027_S0000064	she had been running a food truck business and trying to work her way onto reality t v shows and cozying up to whomever was the most relevant powerful or famous then she met donald
POD1000000027_S0000067	money and hermes bags are gifts and never ever humiliate the wife but v stiviano either did not know or did not care because she broke every last rule in the mistress terms and agreements
POD1000000027_S0000068	she went right at shelly
POD1000000027_S0000071	she kept telling people she was going to be the next missus sterling
POD1000000027_S0000072	kathrine baumann is one of shelly is best friends and a longtime clippers fan
POD1000000027_S0000073	she would stalk shelly she would watch where shelly would go and then she would show up and i do remember the one time she went into the restroom where shelly was just paraded around showed off herself then shelly walked out
POD1000000027_S0000074	at clippers games the entire extended sterling universe was usually there and usually just feet from one another sometimes shelly and donald sat in their courtside seats together and v sat in her seats directly across the court
POD1000000027_S0000075	other nights v would sit next to donald and shelly was nowhere to be seen clippers players like ryan hollins and matt barnes got used to v being around you could not not notice her
POD1000000027_S0000078	clippers employees often got caught in the middle of this bizarre triangle shelly would call team president andy roeser demanding that v not be allowed in the building and then donald would call roeser and ask him to leave 4 tickets for her
POD1000000027_S0000079	these were relationships begging to implode but none of the entangled ever tried to solve the problem donald shelly v each kept pushing each other waiting for someone to break
POD1000000027_S0000080	well the breaking started on christmas day 2012 v called the sterling house asking to speak to donald
POD1000000027_S0000082	shelly was mortified the family was sitting at the dinner table waiting for donald as he is pacing on the tennis courts outside fighting with his mistress
POD1000000027_S0000085	the fight with shelly started when he hung up
POD1000000027_S0000086	not that that was uncommon even without v they fought often but this was escalating shelly and donald is youngest son scott had to step in before it got physical he confronted his father and demanded he stop this nonsense with v
POD1000000027_S0000091	a week later scott died
POD1000000027_S0000100	shelly was devastated
POD1000000027_S0000103	it was not just that the fight with v was a last volatile moment between donald and scott
POD1000000027_S0000105	when scott died donald stayed with v instead of going home to his wife as she grieved it was too much she kicked don out of the house
POD1000000027_S0000107	shelly needed breathing room and i think don had pushed the envelope a little too far
POD1000000027_S0000110	but shelly and donald had been together too long been through too much together had too much of their lives and their money intertwined
POD1000000027_S0000112	they did not divorce the situation simply continued to deteriorate over the next year as donald spent more and more time with v
POD1000000027_S0000114	plus shelly was starting to learn about the gifts v posted pictures on instagram v driving the $240000 red ferrari that donald had bought her
POD1000000027_S0000115	and the range rover and the 2 bentleys shelly also found out that donald had bought v a $1800000 duplex
POD1000000027_S0000117	it was that anger shelly brought to neiman marcus with her returns on the fateful day she that she encountered donald and v it was not the 1st time the 2 women had run into each other or argued but this time shelly decided she would had enough
POD1000000027_S0000119	on march 72014 shelly sterling filed a lawsuit in california superior court against v stiviano seeking the return of all those gifts from donald
POD1000000027_S0000121	donald and shelly sterling were worth multiple 1000000000s of dollars and had done what the ultra rich do put all their money and property into a joint trust
POD1000000027_S0000122	every dime the sterlings spent cost each of a them a nickel therefore shelly argued the money that donald used to pay for the gifts was just as much hers as it was his
POD1000000027_S0000123	so she turned to the courts that sounds a little extreme well you do not know the sterlings calling a lawyer is how they get out of bed in the morning
POD1000000027_S0000126	she kept saying to donald you better have her drop the lawsuit and he would say 0 she will not really go through with it but she is just doing it for effect and she says well she better drop the lawsuit
POD1000000027_S0000127	but here is how the lawsuit the courtroom product of a bedroom dispute really came to change everything for some time now v had been recording her conversations with donald
POD1000000027_S0000128	sweetie i am sorry
POD1000000027_S0000130	and according to v and her lawyer donald was aware she was making the tapes
POD1000000027_S0000135	she would recorded 100s of conversations over the past 2 years a lot of the recordings were mundane boring even but some of the recordings were arguments and captured a side of donald that he would never want his wife or anyone else to hear
POD1000000027_S0000137	no matter what the original intent of those tapes was they became something v could use as blackmail because v stiviano had no intention of returning those gifts from donald
POD1000000027_S0000139	v says to donald i want that bitch wife of yours lawsuit dismissed
POD1000000027_S0000140	pierce 0 donnell is shelly sterling is lawyer
POD1000000027_S0000141	and he tried to get shelly to dismiss it and she would not do it
POD1000000027_S0000142	if donald could not or would not fix the situation v decided she would take matters into her own hands it was time to use the tapes
POD1000000027_S0000143	to reveal donald sterling for who he really was
POD1000000027_S0000161	on april 92014 a clippers executive assistant texted v on behalf of donald
POD1000000027_S0000166	mister sterling said to let me know if you need anything we do not want to have any issues at the game
POD1000000027_S0000178	it was shocking the clippers assistant immediately emailed the file to clippers president andy roeser and that is how shelly learned about the tape too
POD1000000027_S0000180	and i said well what is the tape about so i said to andy andy roeser i said andy what are you doing about this and he says 0 well she will never do anything
POD1000000027_S0000181	roeser had worked for donald sterling for nearly 3 decades he did what everybody learns to do after a while stay out of the really ugly stuff
POD1000000027_S0000182	donald and shelly had cleaned up their own messes for 6 decades he figured they would eventually make this one go away too but they did not shelly told her lawyers about the tapes
POD1000000027_S0000183	and they in turn went to v is lawyer and demanded to hear them and that is when v stiviano made her big move
POD1000000027_S0000186	mike walters was the news director at t m z at the time now he runs his own celebrity news site the blast
POD1000000027_S0000187	the 1st thing i did was say who is donald sterling i had heard the name i knew that donald sterling was important but i had no idea that he owned the clippers
POD1000000027_S0000201	the fact is shelly and several people in the clippers organization heard the recording and decided not to act on it or were not appalled enough to act on it maybe they did not understand how big a splash this tape could make
POD1000000027_S0000209	so mike walters called up the n b a their new commissioner adam silver had barely been in office for 3 months
POD1000000027_S0000210	i actually had never heard of adam silver until that day
POD1000000027_S0000217	after calling the league t m z called the clippers to let them know they were about to publish a tape that would be very damaging to donald sterling
POD1000000027_S0000218	if you are donald sterling there is never a good time to have your girlfriend out you as a racist if you are the clippers this could not have happened at a worse moment donald sterling is clippers had been a laughing stock for decades
POD1000000027_S0000220	because honestly like these clippers jokes is something we they are not even jokes they are statements of fact
POD1000000027_S0000222	in the 30 some odd years he had owned the team they would only made the playoffs 6 times they would never even moved past the semifinals that had all started to change in the late 2000s thought the team had drafted a star blake griffin
POD1000000027_S0000223	n b a rookie of the year blake griffin
POD1000000027_S0000225	and then ended up with another star chris paul
POD1000000027_S0000226	los angeles is electric with the addition of chris paul to the clippers
POD1000000027_S0000231	in time for this season the clippers had also managed to get themselves one of the best coaches in the n b a doc rivers
POD1000000027_S0000232	it is doc rivers to the clippers 3 years $21000000
POD1000000027_S0000240	once the clippers staff found out t m z was going to publish the tape andy roeser went to coach doc rivers he needed him to talk to the team before the story broke
POD1000000027_S0000241	andy i remember coming into my office one day and said hey there is a tape that t m z has this is going to come out it is not that flattering but it is not a big deal honestly i thought it was a sex tape because donald sterling i really did
POD1000000027_S0000242	so doc did as he was told he gathered the players and warned them that something was coming superstar clippers forward blake griffin and center ryan hollins were in that room
POD1000000027_S0000243	doc gathered us
POD1000000027_S0000244	doc said hey guys we need to meet and talk
POD1000000027_S0000253	this is an audio recording purportedly of los angeles clippers owner donald sterling making racist remarks to his girlfriend is being investigated by the national basketball association
POD1000000027_S0000268	like t m z is mike walters as soon as i heard that tape i knew this was going to be huge
POD1000000027_S0000270	sterling has a long history of questionable behavior
POD1000000027_S0000273	within hours the audio of donald sterling making racist remarks to v stiviano had gone viral
POD1000000027_S0000278	by morning lebron james the biggest star in the league was saying there was no room for a person like donald sterling in the n b a
POD1000000027_S0000280	and across the country adam silver was facing his 1st real crisis
POD1000000027_S0000281	n b a commissioner adam silver sitting down in memphis addressing the comments made by donald sterling
POD1000000027_S0000284	i am not yet prepared to discuss any potential sanctions against donald sterling we will however move extraordinarily quickly in our investigation
POD1000000027_S0000286	if it was sterling on those tapes if they had not been doctored or altered silver knew he wanted to punish him severely the league was outraged
POD1000000027_S0000287	because on top of donald sterling saying all these unforgivably racist things sterling was also taking shots at one of the most beloved figures in all of basketball magic johnson
POD1000000027_S0000289	it was as shocking and as bizarre anything on the tape that a picture of v stiviano and magic johnson had set him off to hear donald sterling talk that way about magic
POD1000000027_S0000290	the guy who would turned the lakers into a dynasty who would fought off h i v that is the guy donald sterling told his mistress was not welcome at his games
POD1000000027_S0000294	even the famously apolitical michael jordan voiced his outrage
POD1000000027_S0000295	michael jordan weighed in there is no room in the n b a or anywhere else for the kind of racism and hatred that mister sterling allegedly expressed we cannot tolerate must not tolerate discrimination at any level
POD1000000027_S0000298	it is like what one of the paparazzi who was tailing donald and shelly told me it had all the elements sex money sports politics greed racism
POD1000000027_S0000299	it had everything it even had the visor you remember the visor that daft punk welding mask meets florida grandma visor that v stiviano wore any time she stepped outside her house
POD1000000027_S0000300	but still say nothing is v stiviano not late this afternoon when she arrived home or when she left tonight wearing different clothes but color coordinated face shields
POD1000000027_S0000302	have you talked to mister sterling can you explain the mask
POD1000000027_S0000306	by the end of the weekend the 1st black president of the united states was answering questions about sterling
POD1000000027_S0000309	the tapes dominated the news cycle not just because they were juicy but because donald sterling was articulating something deeper more shameful
POD1000000027_S0000314	including ryan hollins
POD1000000027_S0000318	los angeles sits on 2 fault lines the san andreas and race all of us know it we live with it donald sterling was another
POD1000000027_S0000319	anyone who played for him or worked for him or covered him in the press or lived in one of his 100s of apartments on the one hand knew that it was all a matter of time until he blew up the underlying issues with sterling were well known and well documented
POD1000000027_S0000320	but like most insanely wealthy white men in america donald had managed to wiggle bully and fight his way out of all he knew how to play his leverage and power outlast his adversaries and win you can call it that
POD1000000029_S0000002	from american public media this is marketplace tech demystifying the digital economy and jack steward informally wood
POD1000000029_S0000006	nearly every crisis facebook now faces stems from that nicholas thompson editor in chief of wired says that is left management is navigate metaphorical mind field
POD1000000029_S0000010	secondly one of the smartest business decisions that mark zuckerberg ever made was to buy instagram and people do not really understand that instagram is owned by facebook or if they distrust facebook they do not distrust instagram so instagram continues to grow
POD1000000029_S0000023	absolutely what are the stakes to their business they are a very high if scandal continues to multiply there could be real consequences down the road what are the stakes specifically to top management meaning mark zuckerberg and sheryl sandberg 2 people who we most associate with the company
POD1000000029_S0000024	for zuckerberg he is going to run the company as long as he wants to he has voting control of the shares he is appointed his friends as board members he is in a good position
POD1000000029_S0000025	whenever he wants to go and run the chan zuckerberg initiative or just go be an intellectual thought leader or do bill gates type things he will go choose to do that for sandberg it is tougher
POD1000000029_S0000026	and there were moments in the last year where it seemed like she might be sacrificed or where she might be in big trouble zuckerberg has expressed his loyalty to her
POD1000000029_S0000036	there was one specific story that stunned me and that was the circumstances that led to the departure of the 2 founders of instagram kevin systrom and mike krieger
POD1000000029_S0000037	and when fred vogelstein and i started reporting the story and we made a list of the mysteries we wanted to solve and that was at the very top why had they left it seemed strange they had left all of a sudden in september
POD1000000029_S0000038	no one knew why and late in the reporting you know months into reporting the story we finally learned the full story and that is that according to people close to them they had grown frustrated with zuckerberg is increased meddling
POD1000000029_S0000040	and there was a sense among some people at facebook that instagram is growth was coming at the expense of core facebook and that led to all kinds of tensions and then a big fight at the end of july and a moment where mark zuckerberg
POD1000000029_S0000042	and then he gave the list to kevin systrom and said we are getting rid of all of these and according to people familiar with the story systrom reacted quite badly to that and then went on paternity leave came back and said i am done here
POD1000000029_S0000043	and so the biggest surprise to us was that the departure of systrom and krieger which had not come out before was much tenser much tenser than i had believed when i began reporting the story
POD1000000029_S0000044	nick thompson editor in chief of wired for context a $5000000000 fine would be a record tech penalty in the u s bitting the 22000000 the google have to pay in 2012
POD1000000029_S0000049	if you enjoyed mark zuckerberg is testimony in front of congress here in the u s with his zinging comebacks like senator we run ads then maybe you will enjoy hearing more directly from mister zuckerberg himself

POD1000000047_S0000002	we will considering a starting podcast back then and i recorded this trial episode with my colleague jess whittlestone but ultimately we did not have the time to go on ahead with the project but i thought why not dig it up and release it now
POD1000000047_S0000004	david spiegelhalter is a statistician at the university of cambridge and something of an academic celebrity in the u k
POD1000000047_S0000016	to help us answer some of these questions we are joined by professor david spiegelhalter the wilton professor for the public understanding of risk at cambridge university professor spiegelhalter spent much of his life trying to improve public understanding of statistics science and risk in ordinary life
POD1000000047_S0000115	yeah i have actually written an article with ah professor toby ord about why we should not discount health even though we should discount financial returns about why why it is appropriate in one case and not in the other so we will put up a link to that ah on the website ah so
POD1000000047_S0000244	yeah i think that is about all we have got time for now but thanks so much david this has been very informative really interesting
POD1000000047_S0000247	alright if you would like to hear more from professor spiegel halter then you can find his blog at understanding uncertainty online and he is also often on the radio in the u k in particular on more or less on b b c 4
POD1000000048_S0000001	hi i am rob director of research at 80000 hours today i am speaking with miles brundage research fellow at the university of oxford is future of humanity institute
POD1000000048_S0000003	miles is research has been supported by the national science foundation the bipartisan policy center and the future of life institute thanks for making time to talk to us today miles
POD1000000048_S0000051	and miles you have a forthcoming guide to ah work on a i policy and strategy that ah we are going to link to so here we are going to try to go beyond that if you find yourself a little bit confused then potentially just go on to read one of those one of those documents 1st
POD1000000048_S0000059	so there has been a little bit of work for example ah by armstrong et al at the future of humanity institute ah looking at ah arms race type scenarios involving a i where there would be an incentive to skimp
POD1000000048_S0000095	so the example i mentioned of ah the paper by armstrong et al ah called racing to the precipice is one example and it presented sort of a stark version of the arms race scenario
POD1000000048_S0000100	ah progress to be made so ah there was a paper put out by the future of humanity institute ah by nick bostrom carrick flynn and ah allan defoe recently that ah looks at policy desiderata for the development of machine superintelligence
POD1000000048_S0000116	another resource that comes to mind is a syllabus for a class on the global politics of a i developed by ah allan dafoe at yield and the future of humanity institute
POD1000000048_S0000191	so ah otherwise i would say that that is a good place to to go so ah likewise we do not really know what the agenda of the trump administration is on the a i front
POD1000000048_S0000314	yeah i suppose you could always track the things that you know people like you or nick bostrom are saying and how you speak about the issues so that you so you do not come across as alarmist and you know you you have a measured and precise tone
POD1000000048_S0000338	so ah there are people at f h i who also are affiliated with the center for effective altruism and involved in building the e a community ah like owen cotton barratt and toby ord
POD1000000048_S0000350	and it took the work of ah nick bostrom in superintelligence and stuart russell in giving a lot of talks and writing op eds to call more attention to it and give it more legitimacy

YOU1000000020_S0000174	and sid for he knows are the godfathers and a lot of people do regard them as the creators of these certain deck
YOU1000000020_S0000183	jacob wilson has been utterly dominant this weekend but he just suffered a brutal loss in the heads of eric forlac and if he does not make the top 8 that last play is going to come back to haunt him
YOU1000000020_S0000186	here we are it is the last round of the day it all comes down to this if jacob wilson wins he advances to the final day if he loses he is done
YOU1000000020_S0000187	our 1st player seth nanfield standing in his way jacob wilson
YOU1000000020_S0000189	alright here is lava spike to take jacob wilson down to 10
YOU1000000020_S0000191	down to 2 is jacob
YOU1000000020_S0000193	jacob is turning the tables and going on the offensive here he has got his guns blazing against seth and seth has fallen to 6
YOU1000000020_S0000196	that is game that is going to do it jacob wilson has won
YOU1000000020_S0000198	how do you feel as seth nanfield right now
YOU1000000020_S0000203	so jacob was about to die to a lethal barrage of burn spells and then cast a drew his single copy of the white ley line to protect himself
YOU1000000020_S0000205	from canada jacob wilson
YOU1000000020_S0000209	hello and welcome to the last quarter final of pro tour theater forge we are going to start off with yelger wegishima against jacob wilson a 19 year old
YOU1000000020_S0000211	let us get right down to the floor and see who is going to win between yelger wegishima and jacob wilson
YOU1000000020_S0000213	yelger is hand has everything
YOU1000000020_S0000215	jacob is in game 3 in a 2 out of 3 against
YOU1000000020_S0000216	yelger wegishima who is a dutch hall of fame magic player so not an easy opponent
YOU1000000020_S0000218	game one yelger had an instant win combo that involved making an infinite number of fairies that all attack at once for infinite damage
YOU1000000020_S0000219	and then in game 2 jacob was able to survive despite the fact that yelger rained an anger of the gods that destroyed all of jacob is creatures
YOU1000000020_S0000220	but then jacob summoned an elephant soldier called loxodon smider that finished the job and killed yelger in game 2 so now we re onto game 3
YOU1000000020_S0000221	jacob has got a very good start but yelger is deck is capable of winning in an eye blink so the suspense is pretty good
YOU1000000020_S0000223	voice researches is running through what could he have jacob does not have a lot of outs here things are not looking good for him
YOU1000000020_S0000225	going to put this spluncher twin on this pestermite do you have a response shows the path to exile to yelger who now will show him the disbow
YOU1000000020_S0000228	the game there is the end yelger wigishima advances to the semi finals over jacob wilson
YOU1000000020_S0000230	another great performance from young jacob wilson but it was not quite enough against the dutch hall of famer i know this has to be so disappointing for him
YOU1000000020_S0000232	you are graded on how many top 8s you have achieved i think that ultimately jacob is going to embrace that fact
YOU1000000020_S0000254	this is the one invitational in richmond i am here with our champion jacob wilson congratulations man with a hand shake that is a little bit of hardware you are no stranger to this
YOU1000000023_S0000002	fire emblem is turning 30 next year and with 16 main games and a few spinoffs it is safe to say that it has grown into something extraordinary the games are packed with deep story lines and memorable characters like marth
YOU1000000023_S0000003	that is not marth marth that is which one is marth
YOU1000000023_S0000005	marth
YOU1000000023_S0000022	that way the audience could be like ah that dude is wearing a tight fitting suit with a bunch of weird patches that must be arlecchino the servant clown sometimesto 2 masters this brought the audience in immediately they knew what that character was about without any exposition
YOU1000000023_S0000027	cain and abel are battle bros they fight together but not in the biblical sense bord and cords are similar except they are usually ax fighters pegasus sisters are a trio of flying horses ladies
YOU1000000023_S0000028	you can not split these archetypes up into their solo characters because their bond is what defines them you can not have a waluigi without a luigi and in the same way you can not have a bord without a cord which is my favorite doctor seuss book
YOU1000000023_S0000029	jagens are mentors that are strong in the beginning and then you will quickly outpace them and it is kind of sad like the 1st time you beat your dad in a basketball game oifeys are similar to jagens except they will keep dunking on you till you are dead
YOU1000000023_S0000030	wendells are mentors but for magic gotohs are mentors but only the last half of the game beowolfs are mercenaries that you have to pay actual in game currency to recruit and ogmas are mercenaries that usually decide to join you out of their own volition
YOU1000000023_S0000034	you can not get the other kind of like if 2 of your friends start dating and then have a really messy breakup corneliuses are usually the parental figure to the main character and they have this nasty habit of getting axed super early on in the game
YOU1000000023_S0000035	it is kind of like fire emblem does not know how to make interesting characters without making them suffer traumatic parental death
YOU1000000023_S0000049	but before i get there i just want to commend fire emblem for have 596 playable characters and only repeating 3 names when i was hired for my 1st job at a climbing gym i was one of 5 employees named brian
YOU1000000023_S0000054	that took like 30 minutes but let us begin the honorable knight like fiona who cares passionately about her people and will always oppose cruelty to civilians
YOU1000000023_S0000055	which is way better than the loyal knight like troude who only is loyal to perne and will do literally anything for him even though perne is a bad dude but i will get to that later
YOU1000000023_S0000059	but that is not my fault super smash should have included more magic babies arrogants hotheads and edgelords all have a mean side but arrogants like vaike just think they are the best hotheads like caspar want to fight anything that moves
YOU1000000023_S0000060	and edgelords like niles retweet joker accounts unironically a lot of these characters have rough childhoods but then turn out cheerful despite that and then there is the inferiority complex archetype which i could have just called the majority of children in fire emblem fates
YOU1000000023_S0000061	perfectionists mischief makers and flirts are all highly motivated but subaki is motivated to meet high expectations claude is motivated to make intricate schemes and sylvain is motivated to be a fuccboi
YOU1000000023_S0000062	buzzkills are just characters that are not very fun to talk to and fire emblem i will never forgive you for naming an unemotional uber religious deadbeat dad gilbert it also does not help that i look like hanneman lite
YOU1000000023_S0000064	0 god am i a buzzkill a lot of these archetypes are based around one singular personality trait scarlet is straightforward valbar is chill linhardt is lazy sumia is clumsy petra is a sweetie and ranulf is a furry
YOU1000000023_S0000066	child soldier karin is canonically 14 years old
YOU1000000023_S0000069	manuela is constantly drinking and flirting and just being a hot mess and i love her for it and that makes her the president of vices
YOU1000000023_S0000070	the vice president but be careful not to do that around someone like astram who is constantly accusing people of treason for no good reason
YOU1000000023_S0000072	here is an archetype i call what the fuck and it is the 3 characters that make me say what the fuck fire emblem people like perne who is said to be a sweet robin hood type except he does kidnap a young girl and keeps her as his slave
YOU1000000023_S0000073	or tharja who practices curses on her own daughter or roger who is actually he is not actually that bad
YOU1000000023_S0000074	but fire emblem does go out of their way to make his end screen say that he never gets a date and he stays single for the rest of his life and it is like what the fuck fire emblem you did not have to do him dirty like that
YOU1000000023_S0000075	the next archetype is called actually pretty interesting these characters are 3 dimensional and well developed people like libra who struggles with his faith and has incredible self doubt even though he is doing all he can to help those around him
YOU1000000023_S0000076	or rhys who dreams of being a sword fighter but his weak constitution will not allow him to become one and so he helps in the ways he can but his whole story is one of unfulfilled dreams
YOU1000000023_S0000078	and that is it those are the only 2 interesting characters in fire emblem until we get to raphael my sweet bulky boy who only cares about eating and training and not about studying
YOU1000000023_S0000094	ah and that just sounds like a pretty run of the mill awkward family reunion and when you think about it these ones are just strange characters that have ah that are good at fighting i mean if you include dmitri in this he has an eye patch okay
YOU1000000023_S0000095	which is similar to these ones seteth and byleth have the they rhyme ah we also i mean dorothea wears a hat until she grows out of the hat think about that do not even get me started on oboro
YOU1000000023_S0000101	arlecchino the servant clown sometimes to 2 masters
YOU1000000023_S0000106	ah that dudes wearing a tight fitting suit with a bunch weird patches it must be arlecchino the servant clown sometimes to 2 masters okay
YOU1000000029_S0000001	the polls have closed in 3 more states at 730 in the east at this point bill clinton has 58 electoral votes bob dole nothing yet
YOU1000000029_S0000003	c n n coverage of election 96 live from c n n center here are judy woodruff bernard shaw bill schneider and ken boddie
YOU1000000029_S0000005	and the biggest electoral prize at this half hour we can tell you is the state of ohio c n n calls that the state of ohio has been won by president clinton this is a big victory ken boddie for the democrats
YOU1000000029_S0000007	c n n declares that bill clinton has won west virginia is 5 electoral votes
YOU1000000029_S0000010	judy this is fairly typical for north carolina this is a generally republican state in presidential races but george bush won this state by less than one last time he is very closest state
YOU1000000029_S0000019	now let us move over to the electoral map to show you what we have so far president clinton leading bob dole 58 electoral votes the magic number is 270
YOU1000000029_S0000023	ohio and this half hour florida before that those are 2 big states and both in the clinton column
YOU1000000029_S0000025	so if we have these the republicans are in a little bit of difficulty here mister dole
YOU1000000029_S0000027	but well kentucky and indiana is fascinating they are just fascinating and and and the word was that if if dole started out in trouble in kentucky and indiana if he lost them out rightly then i will be out of words
YOU1000000029_S0000030	in june he said if bob dole this he calls himself bob dole he says if bob dole does not win kentucky bob dole can not win the presidency but we do not know yet but it is tight when
YOU1000000029_S0000031	it is right let us take a look now at the states we know ah one or the other has won and here it is for president clinton florida even hearing this in new hampshire ohio vermont and west virginia
YOU1000000029_S0000036	bill schneider you want to take take over with your exit polls here and and i will say the thought i had
YOU1000000029_S0000037	okay we are going to take a look at the state of ohio a big win for bill clinton is not it how did he do it well 13rd of the voters in ohio were union members in the household
YOU1000000029_S0000038	they clearly win a majority a solid majority for bill clinton that big a f l c i 0 push for the democrats for the democratic president paid off in ohio
YOU1000000029_S0000040	now let us look at the voters who decided how they will going to vote just in the last 3 days how did they end up voting well they voted for bob dole it looks like dole talk about his momentum in the last few days
YOU1000000029_S0000042	they were the ones who delivered for bill clinton and that was 70% of the voters in ohio so while do not pick up some late momentum
YOU1000000029_S0000044	you are very good with that john man now i would be jealous tonight well
YOU1000000029_S0000048	live from washington crossfire on the left geraldine ferraro on the right robert novak in the crossfire
YOU1000000029_S0000049	republican senator john mccain of arizona adviser to the dole camp campaign and in new orleans democratic senator john breaux
YOU1000000029_S0000051	good evening welcome to the crossfire finally election day came when bill clinton casting his vote in the renovated train station in little rock arkansas and bob dole voting at the 1st christian church in russell kansas
YOU1000000029_S0000052	the other 1000000s of americans voting today decide of 35 senate contests and 435 house races as well as the presidency president clinton is heavily favored for a 2nd term
YOU1000000029_S0000053	and the big question is who controls congress were the republicans narrowly favored jerry
YOU1000000029_S0000057	talking about we have had ohio that is gone for clinton we have kentucky which still so it was a must win so stay too close to call
YOU1000000029_S0000058	you see that that ah florida has gone to ah president clinton if if dole is in trouble in the south do you see any scenario by which he could win this presidency tonight
YOU1000000029_S0000059	well jerry as as i mentioned before when i i just came off of that 96 hour ah trip ah we centered all we saw enthusiasm every place we went i think that california is still in play
YOU1000000029_S0000060	i think that ah there is a lot of southern states that ah went for ah president clinton last time and i certainly think that ah even though they may be ah called undecided i still believe kentucky and indiana for example will go
YOU1000000029_S0000061	for ah senator dole but i i i do not ah discount the importance of florida and ohio they are important states
YOU1000000029_S0000062	so that so that with all things being equal if if this trend continues senator dole will stay in washington or go back to kansas but not be president of united states
YOU1000000029_S0000067	my feeling is that we pick up like one seat and i am sure that john breaux may have a different ah view but ah i think we would pick up the 4 southern open democratic seats
YOU1000000029_S0000069	senator john breaux ah this is a very good news for president clinton but i wonder if you are popping champagne corks yet
YOU1000000029_S0000072	bob it must be struggling this is devastating news for senator dole in a sense when you do not not carry ohio of which every republican president has always carried and you lose florida that is very bad news for senator dole
YOU1000000029_S0000073	as for as winning an electoral victory and we are not finished voting here in louisiana we got about an hour and a half left and i am very confident that mary landrieu will be victorious
YOU1000000029_S0000074	i think i would agree with mc john mccaine my friend that the senator is going to be very close i would not be surprised if it was 5149 either way
YOU1000000029_S0000076	but i i i just would like to address my my initial questions senator on on how you can square the ah apparent big victory of president clinton
YOU1000000029_S0000079	or because of what he says or what she says in their respective states and it is not that connected to the presidential election i think you could have people voting for president clinton and perhaps voting for a republican senator
YOU1000000029_S0000081	well is not it true that the problem is that some of your candidates in the south like mary landrieu in louisiana and max cleland in georgia ah were election in your moderates they have been liberals all their life and perhaps the voters saw through them
YOU1000000029_S0000082	bob it is really interesting ah they charging mary landrieu being a liberal here is a person who supports the death penalty supports carrying concealed weapons in louisiana and also will support a constitutional amendment to balance the budget that does not sound very liberal too
YOU1000000029_S0000088	ah there you go again following the some of the republican rhetoric she clearly has said that she would have voted just like me and benny jonson on that issue but her opponent and others keep saying well that is not a position that is what she said very clearly
YOU1000000029_S0000092	crossfire is brought to you by l c i international a very different long distance phone company and by chrysler and the cab forward to satana chrysler what is new in your world
YOU1000000029_S0000094	welcome back to crossfire we are talking about election 96 for senator john mccain republican of arizona and dole advisor in new orleans senator john breaux democrat of louisiana
YOU1000000029_S0000097	are you guys going to go after the clinton administration again for another 4 years or are you going to are you going to get that to some serious work in the senate for a change
YOU1000000029_S0000098	jerry could i mention what we will quote before answer and that is we are pleased to see the closure in the popular vote the you should know many of the polls like a b c you had president clinton by 16 in the teens
YOU1000000029_S0000102	we just saw on the front page in your time today mister riady had what 12 the visit today
YOU1000000029_S0000107	well what i hope is that we have ah howard baker on the democrat side as they did during watergate a bipartisan democrat will say look we have got to look into this we have got to go out and then
YOU1000000029_S0000110	i will i will take up on that ah john breaux are you ready to play the role of howard baker and as bill clinton what did he know and when did he know about this ah laundered money from indonesia
YOU1000000029_S0000111	bob the problem is bipartisan as a bipartisan problem just yesterday ah one person who was a supporter and work for the dole campaign confessed to make a a $120000 illegal contribution
YOU1000000029_S0000112	i think the american people want us to to look at some new campaign finance reform john mccain i think he is a leader on this issue or with law without democratic side that is what i think the people want they want to make sure we do it right in the future
YOU1000000029_S0000116	well well john is a realistic louisiana politician you are one of the best of them ah will you would you agree with me that a lot is at stake tonight for the president
YOU1000000035_S0000003	one being the feared and immense kangal
YOU1000000035_S0000016	today i am visiting carl westfield in the u k who is guardian of several kangals
YOU1000000035_S0000017	and also one of the u k is top kangal experts sheila reed in order to find out just what the temperament is
YOU1000000035_S0000020	hi carl

YOU1000000035_S0000035	i met carl is 2 kangals and the 1st thing that hit me was how lovely they were really affectionate and welcoming of strangers
YOU1000000035_S0000036	dave his male kangal just wanted to be petted and loved to roll over and fall down in my lap
YOU1000000035_S0000037	the 2 dogs had an obvious roving curiosity and carl mentioned that he preferred to keep them leashed
YOU1000000035_S0000040	well carl these are beautiful beautiful dogs this is the 1st time i have ever met a kangal dog you get this sort of idea when people go on about them being
YOU1000000035_S0000043	you know a a a good kangal is completely solid temperament basically calm until roused
YOU1000000035_S0000059	let us just quickly talk about dave is ears here because i know people comment a lot about cropped ears
YOU1000000035_S0000061	when they have been very very young and of course little dave here is an is an import so he is he is not being cropped here in the u k
YOU1000000035_S0000062	and carl certainly does not crop any of the ears and of course as you can see here on the female this is what their ears are supposed to look like
YOU1000000035_S0000090	it is it is faun with a black mask
YOU1000000035_S0000115	later that week i dropped by to meet a very special lady indeed sheila reed respected across the u k for her expertise in the kangal breed
YOU1000000035_S0000116	both her and her husband michael had kept kangals for decades now and had traveled out to turkey many times to source dogs from working lines
YOU1000000035_S0000120	our old dog had died and we just wanted we wanted a natural dog we went to see a lady called missus betty marshall
YOU1000000035_S0000121	and she bought our her dog called fenner he stood on his back legs and he put his paws on my shoulders
YOU1000000035_S0000187	i was deeply moved by sheila is stories and found out information i did not previously know such as there being varying types of kangal
YOU1000000035_S0000197	sheila also nicely cleared up the kangal versus anatolian shepherd debate and explained why these 2 dog breeds are certainly not the same
YOU1000000035_S0000206	if you would like to find out more about kangals you can contact carl via his web page
YOU1000000038_S0000001	thank you for joining us i am spencer tilus
YOU1000000038_S0000002	and i am giselle espinales
YOU1000000038_S0000012	and i would not be surprised brave coach john haiber had his own fantasy football draft regular season is right around the corner we will let you know our picks
YOU1000000038_S0000021	spencer you know the lions are one of the teams that every other teams in the bayside ice north division actually circles on their calendar so they mean business
YOU1000000038_S0000026	and what i really was impressed was bradley how calm and composed he was throughout that interview throughout the game
YOU1000000038_S0000043	and the fact is ah ah i mean steven decatur that is they had guys that they were handing the ball off you were running hard downhill and they also had a guy that was about £250 and he was laying guys out i mean he was picking up yards you want about falling forward to get the 1st down
YOU1000000038_S0000044	he was definitely getting that done out that room giselle and i feel like moving forward they got a good thing going there it is always nice when you have a couple of guys who can hit the ball too
YOU1000000038_S0000047	and as coach knox said the cream usually comes to the top
YOU1000000038_S0000049	and see for day hosted a 4 team scrimmage which included parkside james bennett and colonel richardson now a strong play for ball teams at this thing
YOU1000000038_S0000050	and speak in a strong place check out this run here by t j hayward i mean just knocking guys out of his way barreling downhill colonel richardson was moving the ball as well and this thing their quarterback sneaks here in the middle of the crease in
YOU1000000038_S0000051	making a lot of guys miss he is going to be got to watch this year parks on the other hand they were getting it done through the air air in this one out way downhill devin redding slings that beautiful catch their completion
YOU1000000038_S0000055	you know spenser actually being out there on saturday felt like each team was actually playing for a championship one team that stood out from the rest of them where the rams i mean their running game was on point finding the holes evading defenders they could do no wrong in my eyes
YOU1000000038_S0000056	on the other hand what other teams that made some mistakes on both sides of the ball would wear the blue jays i spoke to coach darling he said his team is too selfish right now and is trying to get them to be a more cohesive unit and you know the scrimmage is actually going to help them get to that better direction
YOU1000000038_S0000057	absolutely it is always tough to that is 1st year the program is moving forward you kind of need to get the senior leadership montgometry stabbed yourself so i am sure we will be fine down the stretch but early on it is always up to go but i think that really impressed me was parkside i mean they had some guys down the field that were definitely making some plays of the ball
YOU1000000038_S0000063	hey dude i am matt griffith from easton high school head varsity football coach you are watching the delmarva sports insider

YOU1000000038_S0000069	so i stopped by practice and chatted with my former j v coach now varsity head coach pat mcglinchey to see exactly what while high need to improve upon to return to the base our dominance
YOU1000000038_S0000076	my man nelson brown will be featured in this office talk about him and why he excels at what he does
YOU1000000038_S0000077	ah nelson brown just one of those phenomenal athletes ah he he is not an athlete you that comes around all the time and nelson is being looked at by division one double a football schools
YOU1000000038_S0000078	wait ah he is a scholarship kid and we are waiting on that 1st scholarship ah morgan states been really looking hard at him but you know beside that he is just he goes out there is the ultra competitor
YOU1000000038_S0000081	ah i i got would say the the new comer that i am looking forward to the most is raekwon mccarter he is just at every single thing that we could offer he he goes to the offseason training the weight room the beach
YOU1000000038_S0000083	i got a new guy ah here at corner keandre custon who ah we saw him at the ben tate camp ah honestly in my eyes he was the best corner there talk about him and what what does this young defense will bring to the table
YOU1000000038_S0000084	yeah our our d backs this year are pretty much all new like you said keandre is one of those guys is going to try to shut you down the line of scrimmage
YOU1000000038_S0000088	there is a man nelson brown he was out ah on saturday with a shoulder bruise just precautionary he told me he expects to practice on monday there is another star shain leather barry and he is a veteran a natural born leader of the wildcats i expect those young guys there to look for him
YOU1000000038_S0000092	this the pic out there he is out on the island by himself and this guy will be a natural born leader one thing i really liked about wihi was their defensive line that reduced the red savage breaking through and dropping leather barry for the sack
YOU1000000038_S0000093	i am telling him in elmores or 2 studs on the defensive line this play right here by this young man raekwon mccarter is just a fabulous play look at them take it down through the middle and get those defenders out of his way that is just a filthy move excuse me thank you for a touchdown
YOU1000000038_S0000094	this kid going to be a star not to be outdone delmar junior nelson brown takes the handoff straight up the middle 60 yards out and he did not even get touched folks he got some burners he had a great scrimmage as well
YOU1000000038_S0000095	and for delmar coach dave hearn he knows that the preseason is all about figuring his team out
YOU1000000038_S0000102	my name is david wells inside linebacker for james m bennett and you are watching demo or sports insider
YOU1000000038_S0000105	head coach wheatley is team will be trying to make the state tournament after coming up just one game short a year ago finishing with a 9 in 6 record that right there sara davis putting on the moves from way outside and scoring it just a beautiful goal
YOU1000000038_S0000106	and then just a few minutes later the raiders they are right back at it they found the net one more time this one was from brady keeler with the honors with a beautiful slap shot
YOU1000000038_S0000110	yeah definitely when you are raised up there and the fact is i look to this team and i we went in i was talk with coach really edwards they had they knew they are going to be able to score the ball and they knew they had a good opportunity of being a very high scoring team but they did not realize how good they are going to be defensively and they definitely showed that in the scrimmage
YOU1000000038_S0000114	yeah absolutely by the way congratulations to coach wheatley she actually just got married a couple weeks ago
YOU1000000038_S0000119	we have got 15 girls out here we kind of tried to go with our most athletic girls and just kind of work with it from there but they are very excited coach jackson and i are very excited so it is always cool to have a new program give the kid similar experiences
YOU1000000038_S0000124	and spencer one of the things they have to also see is being able to build that roster and see who is actually going to be able to perform well on the court
YOU1000000038_S0000129	this is monica wheatley for the woodbridge field hockey team and you are watching the delmarva sports insider
YOU1000000038_S0000132	my sleeper pick is actually someone i went to high school with t y hilton the front of the colts a wide receiver and he was as impressive with andrew luck he was impressive as andrew luck is number one option last season after the injury to propane reggie wayne
YOU1000000038_S0000133	i mean just look at those stats from last season hilton had 1083 yards and 5 touchdowns he is speedy and sure wayne is coming back this season but i think hilton will put a big numbers this season
YOU1000000038_S0000135	yeah well my slipper i did not go to high school with but i am going with e j manuel manuel missed 6 games last season with an hyper extended knee but he has got some serious weapons now c j spiller fred jack jackson
YOU1000000038_S0000136	ah they traded for up in a draft for sammy watkins he is a monster the add robert woods and speed the marquise goodwin early but got mike williams and i mean there is a lot of weapons there a lot of young weapons but the very talented he is undrafted in most leagues you know
YOU1000000038_S0000138	i think there is a big reason why he was undrafted most leagues i am sleeping on manuel forward
YOU1000000038_S0000139	but the guy i am going with the titans are always hard i think ladarius green is going to have a big year for these chargers in this year
YOU1000000038_S0000140	i mean he did not exactly have amazing numbers last year i get it he just 13 catches in 3 ds but he is starting to take more and more reps with the ones philip rivers loves his tight ends i think he can get a lot of balls thrown his way this year
YOU1000000038_S0000147	drum roll i got gronk i know somebody out there also has rob gronkowski as their bus i know this guy has an a c l injury and he is no adrian peterson let us be real the unlucky number here is 14 and no that is not the number of touchdowns
YOU1000000038_S0000149	he is also had 8 career surgeries i just do not see the spark in gronkowski how much can you really physically overcome the season the game was just getting even harder
YOU1000000038_S0000150	i do not know any time you got brady i feel like you are going to be all right
YOU1000000038_S0000152	all right sorry now sorry eagle fans but i am going with nick foles yeah i know what you are saying nick foles had amazing numbers last season which is exactly why i am staying away from teams now have film of them in a prepared for chip kelly is offense
YOU1000000038_S0000153	plus he lost the sean jackson he looked lost when i was up there at eagles camp guys but so did all the eagles quarterbacks but i am not saying do not draft the eagles especially sean mccoy
YOU1000000038_S0000154	but i do not think nick ah foles is going to put up half the numbers he put up last year
YOU1000000038_S0000157	i definitely want to stay away from though is eric decker i mean this guy is definitely cause some people from winning their leagues is we are going to dread on i get it i mean he had some good numbers in denver but the fact is that offense is ridiculous there
YOU1000000038_S0000160	next week when we bring in chris russell from e s p n 980 in d c talk about the redskins and coming up after the break one of our favorite segments crazy catches dives and stops our plays of the week coming up you will not want to miss it
