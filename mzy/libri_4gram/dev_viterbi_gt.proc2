POD1000000004_S0000003	leila green is a trauma surgeon in houston
POD1000000004_S0000004	i meet people on the worst day of their life usually
POD1000000004_S0000005	well then i guess i should be glad we did not meet in real life before leila could become doctor green she had to do a whole lot of training
POD1000000004_S0000006	and you know what is really hard to do when you are working a bonkers number of hours eat properly
POD1000000004_S0000007	i was in general surgery residency at the time and kind of tired of eating like hospital food or fast food and things
POD1000000004_S0000008	and that is when she heard about this service a meal kit delivery that would send her all the ingredients she need to make 3 full meals plus instructions on how to make them no more time consuming trips to the grocery store and no more desperation big macs
POD1000000004_S0000009	so i thought well i will try that i got a free box and so i said okay i can do this and i lived by myself so i thought it would just something fun to do
POD1000000004_S0000010	what green is conveniently leaving out of her story is her level of cooking experience pre meal kit
POD1000000004_S0000011	i can heat things up
POD1000000004_S0000013	like
POD1000000004_S0000014	i had to buy so many different things like once like these boxes started coming you need all these like these equipment and things that i did not have i had to buy zesters
POD1000000004_S0000015	and like i did not have a garlic press what is this okay but i i you know i am a surgeon so i have to have all the right instruments where do you
POD1000000004_S0000017	you know to put this stuff together
POD1000000004_S0000018	getting a meal kit every week did force green to upgrade her kitchen utensil game but more importantly it gave her back time something that as a trauma surgeon she does not take for granted
POD1000000004_S0000019	plus the meal kits helped green hone her cooking skills forget just pressing cook on the microwave green is now a master in the fine art of miso plus
POD1000000004_S0000020	you know you have to learn how to like chop everything up and set it aside and
POD1000000004_S0000021	right
POD1000000004_S0000022	you know you really do have to feel like you are cooking things cause you really do have to put everything together
POD1000000004_S0000023	right now i would think if you were a surgeon your knife skills would not be too bad
POD1000000004_S0000024	0 no i mean i can i can cut people and carrots okay i can you know
POD1000000004_S0000025	in the year that green subscribed to that meal kit delivery service she made seared steak and pizza from scratch and a whole host of other things she would never normally prepare for herself and she documented her cooking journey on instagram
POD1000000004_S0000026	but eventually green finished her training and got back to a more regular schedule which allowed for grocery shopping and meal prep so she canceled her subscription
POD1000000004_S0000027	which was bad news for the meal kit service she was using blue apron you may be familiar with the company from such podcasts as all of them

POD1000000004_S0000041	when blue apron began in 2012 it was supposed to revolutionize how americans ate it was going to gently pull us away from our take out and our t v dinners and nudge us back into the kitchen and for a while it worked until it did not
POD1000000004_S0000042	and americans returned to the warm embrace of their boxed mac and cheese and takeout pad thai obviously a home cooking revolution did not materialize
POD1000000004_S0000043	or did it the novel coronavirus has forced many of us to become intimately acquainted with our casserole dishes and our garlic presses and our dutch ovens
POD1000000004_S0000044	we made banana bread by the pallet and sourdough starter by the ton we learned how to sear steaks and spatchcock chickens and all manner of gruesome carnivorous techniques in short boy did we ever cook
POD1000000004_S0000045	all this cooking at home created a maker break moment for blue apron but it was not supposed to be like that just a few years ago the company was valued at $2000000000 now it was barely hanging on by its fingernails
POD1000000004_S0000046	it is only lifeline a global health crisis so required so many of us to shelter in place for months and avoid trips to the grocery store
POD1000000004_S0000047	i am lauren ober and from american public media welcome to the new seasons of spectacular failures the show that always flambees the hell out of failure
POD1000000004_S0000049	legend has it that the idea for blue apron began with an argentinian steak there were these 2 guys matt salzberg and ilia papas they were clever tech entrepreneur types
POD1000000004_S0000050	full of ideas salzberg had an m b a from harvard and cut his teeth in a big new york venture capital firm papas was a go getter software engineer they met at a network y happy hour and decided to go into business together
POD1000000004_S0000051	but what kind of business
POD1000000004_S0000052	their original idea is not meal kits it is more of a research crowd funding idea called petri dish
POD1000000004_S0000053	that is alex konrad he is a senior editor at forbes he wrote about the founders in 2015 petri dish was not the pair is only startup idea
POD1000000004_S0000054	i think another one we highlighted in our article was warby parker for strollers
POD1000000004_S0000055	i do not even understand
POD1000000004_S0000057	a high end but also affordable stroller experience yeah
POD1000000004_S0000058	so those 2 startup ideas a kickstarter for science experiments and a warby parker for strollers were nonstarters for the pair but then over grilled meat it hit them
POD1000000004_S0000059	salzberg and papas are doing dinner and they are struggling to make argentinian steaks on a borrowed grill
POD1000000004_S0000060	and they are like you know would not it be great if there is a service basically for amateurs like us
POD1000000004_S0000061	in fact there was but it was in sweden in 2007 a woman named kicki theander created a company called
POD1000000004_S0000062	middagsfrid that translates into dinner peace in english
POD1000000004_S0000063	let me see if i can pronounce this right middagsfrid
POD1000000004_S0000064	da that is pretty good
POD1000000004_S0000065	theander wanted to solve the vexing nightly problem that families around the world face what are we having for dinner because the answer can not always be ice cream
POD1000000004_S0000066	people started talking about hell hour hum you know like the hour between 5 and 6 when you have to run to the grocery store and fight with your spouse about who is cooking tonight what are we having
POD1000000004_S0000067	that right there is the spirit of entrepreneurship
POD1000000004_S0000068	i think the question is then is this a legitimately huge problem and is this a problem that a lot of people had as well
POD1000000004_S0000069	for salzberg and papas the answer to both of those questions was an enthusiastic yes now at this point it was 2012 and theander is company had been around for 5 years and was growing steadily
POD1000000004_S0000070	it had a few competitors in europe but in the u s nothing of the sort existed which was great for salzberg and papas
POD1000000004_S0000071	and so they think hey we can start our own meal kit company for the u s market called part and parsley
POD1000000004_S0000072	to be clear that is a terrible name and very quickly they changed it to blue apron named for what french apprentice chefs wear in the kitchen
POD1000000004_S0000073	at almost the exact same time a harvard classmate of salzberg is began a rival meal kit company called plated but salzberg and papas were not worried because they had brought on a ringer
POD1000000004_S0000074	matt wadiak a chef with a degree from the prestigious culinary institute of america and wadiak was the guy that was going to make their business stand apart from its rivals
POD1000000004_S0000075	wadiak would basically go and source the ingredients farmers would say okay we would love to lock in these large extra orders
POD1000000004_S0000076	at a scale that is very attractive to us you know many 1000s of ingredients i think you know when he was in his food world that was a differentiator and great for blue apron
POD1000000004_S0000077	not only did wadiak design the menus and source the products but he also served as his social media face of the company he was blue apron is culinary secret weapon and did a series of early youtube videos showcasing his know how
POD1000000004_S0000078	here he is trying to convince us that artichokes are not vile
POD1000000004_S0000079	everybody likes artichokes but they are crazy what do you do with them they are tough they are spiny they are all over the place they are kind of confusing a lot of times people just do not cook them because they do not understand how to cook them so
POD1000000004_S0000081	he cuts into some truly revolting artichokes and proceeds to make my worst dining nightmare
POD1000000004_S0000082	get in there with a spoon and scoop out that really hairy chokey interior and the reason why they call it the choke is because if you eat this you are going to choke it is full of little fibers and it is like a fish bone
POD1000000004_S0000083	in the early days all the founders had to hustle like this before they had staff it was salzberg papas and wadiak packing up boxes in a small kitchen in long island city new york
POD1000000004_S0000084	then seemingly out of nowhere the company landed some sweet venture capital to the tune of $3000000 things were looking good for the startup
POD1000000004_S0000085	within the 1st few years the business took off in 2014 blue apron was shipping 600000s meals a month by 2016 it was 8000000 meals and a $1000000000 in revenue
POD1000000004_S0000086	within just 5 years of its founding the company employed 4500 people and was valued at nearly $2000000000 blue apron looked like it was on the express train to successville
POD1000000004_S0000087	blue apron seemed to be sort of the buzziest the biggest market share the leader in this emerging category
POD1000000004_S0000088	which included hellofresh sunbasket and about a 1000000 companies with the word chef in the name
POD1000000004_S0000089	then i actually tried the products and it seemed at least to me personally just as someone testing the products that blue apron overall kind of had the experience that resonated the most with me and i thought might resonate the most with americans
POD1000000004_S0000090	now the thing about americans is
POD1000000004_S0000091	we love products that claim to make our lives easier more convenient less of a hassle and that is exactly what blue apron was doing it was saying hey working mom we know you have a lot in your plate l 0 l
POD1000000004_S0000092	we want to help you cook nutritious and delicious meals for your family without the hassle of going to the grocery story or reading a cookbook
POD1000000004_S0000093	but it was also saying hey millennial we know you are a work hard play hard eat sloppy takeout at 9 p m kind of person but we also know that you would love to cook if only it was not such a time consuming pain in the ass
POD1000000004_S0000094	so we are going to make it super convenient for you
POD1000000004_S0000096	this american obsession with convenience around food and in particular the magical home cooked meal minus the effort goes back to at least to the late 19th century says culinary historian laura shapiro
POD1000000004_S0000097	that was when a particular brand of utopian fiction began to emerge
POD1000000004_S0000098	the plot was sort of the same somebody is taking a walk they get bonked on the head when they wake up it is 500 years in the future and they are surrounded by all these strange looking creatures and it is a whole different world
POD1000000004_S0000099	and somebody takes them to dinner they take them home to dinner and it is a miracle dinner
POD1000000004_S0000100	the food just appeared with the press of a button or the wave of an arm and it was scrumptious and filling and most importantly back then digestible
POD1000000004_S0000101	miracle food it was utopian food and that has been a dream i think that is attached itself to the american dinner table for decades and decades
POD1000000004_S0000102	not long after the emergence of this utopian fiction dinning actually did start to look like a miracle you could buy vegetables in a can and chicken in a can and later full meals like spaghetti and meatballs in a can
POD1000000004_S0000103	then in the 1950s came the frozen turkey dinner just whack it in the oven and presto a rubbery simulacrum of the real thing but it was quick and clean up was a breeze
POD1000000004_S0000104	mother murphy lucky me my wife uses swanson t v turkey dinners and make your husband lucky too get swanson t v turkey dinners swanson t v fried chicken dinners
POD1000000004_S0000105	swanson t v beef dinners from your grocer is big freezer
POD1000000004_S0000106	when frozen fish sticks hit the scene around the same time 0 buddy it was utopian fiction come to life
POD1000000004_S0000107	master chad morley ate missus paul is fish sticks with his fingers
POD1000000004_S0000108	now i am 32 and i use a fork sometimes
POD1000000004_S0000109	missus paul is fish sticks you will never stop loving them
POD1000000004_S0000110	it was an immediate success these you know deep fried frozen fish sticks that tasted not at all of fish which meant that that people adored them
POD1000000004_S0000111	obviously fish sticks took off and the industry used that as an excuse to stickily everything chicken eggplant lima beans whatever you could deep fry and freeze the packaged food industry tried it
POD1000000004_S0000112	the post war years also brought an explosion of fast food and takeout meals and now the 21st century we can order just about any food we want from some vegan drumsticks to a prix fixe haute cuisine meal just by pressing an app
POD1000000004_S0000113	all of these iterations of the miracle dinner it is like they aim at 3 longings that women have always had when they think about making dinner they want it to be effortless
POD1000000004_S0000114	they want it to be delicious and they want it to have the moral value of home cooking
POD1000000004_S0000115	the home cooking aspect of this is perhaps the most resonant
POD1000000004_S0000116	the thing that home cooking delivers that none of these other things do is that it satisfies i think what we all feel as the moral imperative to cook
POD1000000004_S0000117	there is something that just does not click in when the thing comes in from outside
POD1000000004_S0000118	and this is a great thing for a company like blue apron because
POD1000000004_S0000119	blue apron inches a little closer to that it it just it gets you that much closer to feeling as though you have cooked to this
POD1000000004_S0000120	notice shapiro said feeling as though you cooked something because for her what blue apron is doing despite all of its fresh ingredients and chef inspired recipes is helping you assemble
POD1000000004_S0000121	they kind of fool you into thinking you are cooking where is real cooking hands on cooking knowledgeable cooking has to do with cooking day after day
POD1000000004_S0000122	does not mean you are making fabulous elaborate meals day after day even if it is the simplest possible thing that is cooking
POD1000000004_S0000123	sure getting a dime bag of za atar a thimbleful of pepitas and a literal tablespoon of sesame oil in your meal kit does have a somewhat infantilizing effect
POD1000000004_S0000124	but in blue apron is early years plenty of people were happy to have everything portioned out for them but convincing potential customers that they wanted and needed a service like that that cost the company some big cash
POD1000000004_S0000125	in the form of free meals tons of specials and endless advertising anyone who listened to podcasts in 2015 through 2018 is bound to have heard at least one disinterested podcast host give a lackluster blue apron ad read
POD1000000004_S0000127	in biz speak all of this is known as the cac or customer acquisition cost
POD1000000004_S0000128	what it is supposed to be is the total amount of money that the company spent
POD1000000004_S0000129	on marketing to acquire customers divided by the number of customers that they actually acquired
POD1000000004_S0000130	that is dan mccarthy he is the marketing professor at emory university is business school and he is studied blue apron for years mccarthy says that in the early days blue apron was spending about $6070 per customer
POD1000000004_S0000131	but then as people came and went blue apron had to spend more and more money to get new customers on board the customer acquisition cost just kept creeping up and up and up until it nearly doubled
POD1000000004_S0000132	and you can imagine if you are spending a 120 just to bring somebody in when you talk about the amount of profit that you need after that to to break even on that customer that is a tougher proposition
POD1000000004_S0000133	the more money blue apron spent the harder it was to recoup the investment which brings us to the 2nd problem preventing customers from bolting once the company has spent all that money to bring them in
POD1000000004_S0000134	how many customers stick around is measured by a really important metric called churn rate the churn rate tells you the rate at which customers come into and spin out of the business
POD1000000004_S0000135	if you are spending a lot of cash to land new customers and they do not stick around long enough to make any money off of them you have high customer acquisition costs and a high churn rate
POD1000000004_S0000136	that is where blue apron found itself and even the most basic cooking dodo could tell you that is a gourmet recipe for losing a lot of money
POD1000000004_S0000137	our pal doctor green used blue apron for about a year which is way longer than most of its customers stuck around
POD1000000004_S0000138	yes about half the people were churning out in a month by 6 months about 70% of their customers were churning out they just were not were not able to keep those customers for as long as they they should
POD1000000004_S0000139	despite blue apron is early success and growth one nut the company is never been able to crack is how to stop that outflow how do you get people to subscribe and stay subscribed at least long enough to make a profit off of them it is a puzzle
POD1000000004_S0000140	but despite its high churn rate blue apron was still the market leader it had gotten a slight jumpstart on rival hellofresh and it was starting to look a real sexy to big investors
POD1000000004_S0000141	they were the £800 gorillas and even though the space itself was not that that large at the time it was still something like $5000000000 and growing really quickly
POD1000000004_S0000142	on its face business seemed booming but the whole meal kit market was on the cusp of a shake up
POD1000000004_S0000143	in 2017 grocery chains albertsons and kroger each picked off competing meal kit companies then another blue apron rival chef would abruptly shut down and laid off all its employees only to be bought a week later
POD1000000004_S0000144	and so blue apron was at a crossroads says alex konrad
POD1000000004_S0000145	for startups the most common exits are you know you fail you go public or you get bought those are really the only traditional outcomes and so for the companies that did not want to fail they were going to have to go public someday or sell
POD1000000004_S0000146	like that that is that is just the reality
POD1000000004_S0000147	so blue apron had 3 choices pack it in sell or go public we are going to take a quick break when we come back join me in my outdated condo kitchen as i whip up some delicious blue apron meals
POD1000000004_S0000148	and we explain how the really terrible coronavirus was also a little bit good for blue apron plus we gaze into our meal kit crystal ball to see what the future might hold spoiler the future is delicious

POD1000000004_S0000167	okay so i just got my blue apron box at my doorstep and when i picked it up i could not believe how heavy it was
POD1000000004_S0000168	when the box arrived it felt like christmas except better because the food was not mediocre and arranged in a shrink wrapped basket
POD1000000004_S0000169	so let us crack into this box
POD1000000004_S0000170	inside there were 2 bunches of kales some loose onions and about a 1000000 tiny baggies of nick nacks including 2 tablespoons of creme fraiche a quarter of a cup of panko breadcrumbs and one teaspoon of something called furikake
POD1000000004_S0000171	which according to the blue apron recipe was supposed to quote lend even more savory flavor to my dish yum
POD1000000004_S0000173	there is the tiniest the tiniest tiniest portion of brown rice i mean this must be maybe half a cup in a bag maybe 3 times the size
POD1000000004_S0000174	i decided that it would be sad to cook these dishes by myself so i invited my girlfriend over to experience the magic of blue apron with me
POD1000000004_S0000175	you have a choice between meals tonight

POD1000000004_S0000177	0 well we had the choice of 3 dishes but one of them had cilantro sauce so no thank you another was like a spicy indian situation and i was feeling kind of basic so i chose the pesto and kale pasta with goat cheese
POD1000000004_S0000178	it says this quick cooking pasta gets a 12 punch of irresistible flavor from a dollop of creamy goat cheese for delicious tang and our herbaceous basil pesto stirred into the warm pasta and garlicky kale just before serving
POD1000000004_S0000179	by the way that was a wrong
POD1000000004_S0000180	herbaceous
POD1000000004_S0000181	a touch of crushed red pepper
POD1000000004_S0000182	technically we picked the easiest dish so what things were going well until i dropped a garlic clove down the insinkerator
POD1000000004_S0000183	0 hanna no get your hand out of the garbage disposal
POD1000000004_S0000184	after that near catastrophe we boiled the fresh cavatelli sauteed the kale with garlic and red pepper flakes added the pesto and the dollop of goat cheese and voila
POD1000000004_S0000185	can i get you a bowl of pasta
POD1000000004_S0000186	what why yes
POD1000000004_S0000187	you could
POD1000000004_S0000188	and i am here to report we made a damn fine meal the kale was tender crisp and very well seasoned the cavatelli was perfectly al dente well done hanna and the cheese added some good saltiness
POD1000000004_S0000189	i would say we were perfectly satisfied diners but wait there is more
POD1000000004_S0000190	cleanup is practically nothing because everything came out of a packet so really we are only left with
POD1000000004_S0000191	actually that is really nice
POD1000000004_S0000192	a couple of dishes
POD1000000004_S0000193	i do not want to underestimate that i think that is really nice
POD1000000004_S0000194	but not everyone who is used blue apron has appreciated that the company has gotten flak for its abundant packaging though much of it is now recyclable and customers have complained that the recipes were too complicated
POD1000000004_S0000195	i made 4 blue apron meals for this story and for a middling cook with a reasonable amount of cookware i thought the dishes were pretty simple to assemble also pretty tasty
POD1000000004_S0000196	i would make every single one of those dishes again but i do the shopping myself which i guess sort of defeats the purpose
POD1000000004_S0000197	when i opened my 1st blue apron box it was a novelty a cornucopia and cardboard but then i forgot to cancel my subscription and i got a 2nd box by accident
POD1000000004_S0000198	that one was not as exciting by then i understood the gimmick and the excitement of discovery kind of fizzled in this way i am not too different from a lot of people who try blue apron says professor dan mccarthy
POD1000000004_S0000199	discovery does not tend to last that long there is a bunch of people they look at blue apron as this it is like i want kind of this surprise and delight every month
POD1000000004_S0000200	and the problem is that they may want that initially but after you have been surprised and delighted a few times you say you know i am pretty good i i do not need any more of this surprise and delight
POD1000000004_S0000201	but blue apron execs were like yeah you do you need it and you want it and they believed in their product is ability not just to continually delight but do actually provide a valuable service to people
POD1000000004_S0000202	and all that meant that in 2017 the company had to work out its options pack it in sell or go public
POD1000000004_S0000203	and the higher ups decided on going public
POD1000000004_S0000204	now before offering up public stock in the company for the 1st time blue apron wanted to show strong customer growth so they started to amp up spending to bring in new users
POD1000000004_S0000205	remember cac the customer acquisition cost in the year before the i p 0 blue apron increased its marketing cash by almost 200%
POD1000000004_S0000206	but none of this marketing resulted in a huge new customer haul and that says forbes is alex konrad made investors a little less in love with the company
POD1000000004_S0000207	it was hard to make a really attractive you know future facing story for like how blue apron really becomes that huge
POD1000000004_S0000208	blue apron is books were not the only thing that made investors turn up their noses around the i p 0 a couple weeks before the blue apron team was set to ring the bell for new york stock exchange amazon made a little announcement
POD1000000004_S0000209	it was buying whole foods in a $13700000000 deal for blue apron it was like getting upstaged at your own wedding by an impossibly rich and infinitely more beautiful guest of a guest
POD1000000004_S0000210	when amazon is acquisition of whole foods was announced that was just devastating even just psychologically it felt like you know here come the giants
POD1000000004_S0000211	and if amazon can sell things too online really well and whole foods has pretty good ingredients what is blue apron really selling here
POD1000000004_S0000212	and then of course amazon trademarked its own meal kit offering
POD1000000004_S0000213	everyone was very concerned that and basically this was going to be the next you know i i will not call blue apron end you know but i would say everyone agrees amazon is way bigger so
POD1000000004_S0000215	they are just going to bold their way right in and and stamp this this industry out and so that that was a big lurking concern
POD1000000004_S0000216	blue apron is i p 0 in the summer of 2017 raised $300000000 about a 3rd of what the company anticipated stock went for about $10 a share rather than the expected 15 to $17
POD1000000004_S0000217	it was a turbulent i p 0 to say the least
POD1000000004_S0000218	soon blue apron co founder and c e 0 matt salzberg seemed pretty upbeat about the whole situation on c n b c
POD1000000004_S0000219	i am honestly not here to really talk about the pricing of blue apron stock that is really up to the investors to decide you know blue apron is here because we are excited about the big opportunity that we are going after
POD1000000004_S0000220	we are tackling a huge market and we are focused on the long term quite frankly and the stock price today whether it is up down left or right is really just the beginning of this new chapter in our company is life that we are really excited about
POD1000000004_S0000222	one thing salzberg mentioned in that clip was how his company was tackling a huge market now if you are defining the market as all the people who eat food in america then yeah that is a huge market
POD1000000004_S0000223	but according to the good folks at market research company packaged facts that market has a ceiling and not like a cathedral ceiling
POD1000000004_S0000224	initially the market was definitely expanding exponentially and i think that is where a lot of the interest initially came from if you are seeing these companies that are having a 100% growth like that is really significant
POD1000000004_S0000225	that is cara rasch she is a food and beverage analyst with packaged facts
POD1000000004_S0000226	one of the whole things that i think went wrong with the industry is people thought there was a very big addressable market for meal kits but as it turns out there really is not
POD1000000004_S0000227	it is hard to gauge but rasch estimates that only about one of the u s population uses home delivery meal kits and she says the market kind of peaked 2 or 3 years ago
POD1000000004_S0000228	since blue apron started more than 150 meal kit services have come on the scene but only about 15 to 20 are national operations with hellofresh now the clear market leader
POD1000000004_S0000229	remember when we said amazon trademarked its meal kit back in 2017 rasch says the company never did much with it and that is a pretty good indicator that meal kit delivery is not a growing global concern
POD1000000004_S0000230	i think that amazon saw that much of the market for meal kits had already been addressed by the competitors that were already there so they did not try really to break into that because they did not see much potential for growth anymore
POD1000000004_S0000231	it seems like amazon was right to hold off in 2017 blue apron hemorrhaged 250000 customers and its stock price had tanked just $2 and night ¢9 a share by the end of the year
POD1000000004_S0000232	and there were more problems within a month of the i p 0 co founder matt wadiak stepped down as c 00 matt salzberg then the c e 0 resigned his post shortly thereafter
POD1000000004_S0000233	blue apron is expensive brand spanking new fulfillment center in new jersey had a bunch of tech bugs that needed to be worked out and workers from its california operation filed a class action lawsuit over a alleged missing wages
POD1000000004_S0000234	things were looking pretty grim for the once hyped company
POD1000000004_S0000235	welcome to trading nation i am eric chemi let us take a look at one of last year is high profile i p os that is getting absolutely smoked we are talking of course about blue apron the stock sinking as much as 4% on friday
POD1000000004_S0000236	by the end of 2018 blue apron stock dipped below a dollar a share and the slide did not seem to be letting up
POD1000000004_S0000237	the following summer the company tried to move meant to keep it from being booted from the stock exchange it is called a reverse stocks
POD1000000004_S0000238	split and basically it means that the company bundled it shares so you get a fewer total number of shares but each share is worth more like trading in 4 quarters for a dollar
POD1000000004_S0000239	the move raised the company is stock price but customers still were not flocking to blue apron is boxes now at this point i would have thrown in the towel but not c e 0 linda findley kozlowski
POD1000000004_S0000240	the company would not make kozlowski available for a chat but here she is last year on c n b c is squawk on the streettalking about how jazzed she is about blue apron is prospects
POD1000000004_S0000241	and our recipes our ingredients our culinary authority our brand recognition is by far still number one so we feel confident that when we are talking to investors they appreciate and understand that there is something here it is really just about getting execution right and making sure that we are actually
POD1000000004_S0000242	cool cool cool but also blue apron was thinking about getting down with some strategic alternatives says marketwatch is tonya garcia
POD1000000004_S0000243	strategic alternatives which you know does not means a lot and and nothing at the same time right
POD1000000004_S0000244	it is like saying i am totally happy being single but i would be into dating if the right person came along
POD1000000004_S0000245	it is kind of like one of those things that companies will say when they are just like well we would be open to you know getting bought or a partnership if you are interested you know kind of a thing
POD1000000004_S0000246	in early 2020 blue apron put the word out that it was interested in possibly getting scooped up maybe by a big grocery chain or someone else with deep pockets who wanted to own a meal kit delivery business
POD1000000004_S0000247	at the same time garcia says the company acted like it was in turnaround mode it decided to streamline operations including shutting down its fulfillment center in texas
POD1000000004_S0000248	it also did away with trying to shovel everyone who had ever eaten food into the top of its customer funnel
POD1000000004_S0000249	they have decided to focus on what they call their core customers and these are people who are not going to do like a lot of people and use a coupon and you know get blue apron for a month and then cancel their subscription
POD1000000004_S0000250	so at the same time blue apron was looking to sell it was also doubling down on its mission these were last gasp efforts it wanted to save itself
POD1000000004_S0000251	and then came the most unlikely lifeline anyone could think of a global pandemic a highly contagious virus that required those of us without essential jobs to practically never leave our houses
POD1000000004_S0000252	online grocery delivery shot through the roof and suddenly everyone remembered about this company they heard about on a podcast ad 3 years ago
POD1000000004_S0000253	the pandemic has been actually a bit of a good thing for them because it has raised demand
POD1000000004_S0000254	blue apron sees a lot of potential in what the company is offering especially given that more americans seem to be interested in cooking at home thanks corona
POD1000000004_S0000255	if you are blue apron then you are probably thinking you know well if we do a good job some of this will stick
POD1000000004_S0000256	in the 1st quarter of 2020 when coronavirus brought america to a standstill blue apron customer orders were up a bit though they did not spike like the markets hoped the company still lost $20000000 but that was a little better than the previous quarter
POD1000000004_S0000257	on its 1st quarter earnings call of 2020 the company is c e 0 and c f 0 shook their pom poms like they were on an episode of cheers but like the version that features slightly wooden corporate executives
POD1000000004_S0000258	so now i think the combination of those thing you know puts us in a good position going forward and and you know we can not specifically guide what can happen in the 2nd half of the year because of all the uncertainties
POD1000000004_S0000259	you know we do believe that there will continue to be some positive effects as we move out of q 2
POD1000000004_S0000260	the pandemic seems like it is given blue apron a decent little boost in the 2nd quarter the company brought in 20000s more subscribers but that is still way below where they were in 2019
POD1000000004_S0000261	it is anyone is guess whether blue apron specifically and meal kit delivery more generally are here to stay the business kicki theander founded in sweden 13 years ago is still delivering weekly meal fixings to busy swedes
POD1000000004_S0000262	and despite its own turbulence market leader hellofresh is still cranking out boxes and there is no shortage of small meal kit companies looking to fill paleo or vegan or regional cuisine niches
POD1000000004_S0000263	no one knows what the true impact of a global pandemic will be on how we eat and where and when not yet anyway grocery delivery seems like it is here to stay
POD1000000004_S0000264	maybe high end restaurant takeout will also stick around in some form it is hard to tell whether all those people who took up home cooking out of necessity will continue to bake crusty sourdough and whip up elaborate curries when we can all safely frequent our favorite local spots
POD1000000004_S0000265	blue apron is banking on a sea change in how americans eat the company that was shopping for a buyer just a month before the pandemic hit is now trying to turn a cataclysmic global event into a business saving opportunity

POD1000000010_S0000002	and it changed the whole focus of her life
POD1000000010_S0000003	there are only 2 kinds of people in the world good people and good people in pain
POD1000000010_S0000004	her name is scarlett lewis and before we met her cory i have to confess that i was not necessarily all that impressed with kindness as an idea i mean
POD1000000010_S0000005	you are a kindness skeptic
POD1000000010_S0000006	well i do not want to say skeptic but just let us say that kindness is like a slogan that is on a pillow that i would never have on my couch
POD1000000010_S0000007	but that really really changed for me when we traveled to rural connecticut to spend some time with scarlett
POD1000000010_S0000009	i have lived on this farm for 20 years before the 2 boys and it is really my dream place
POD1000000010_S0000010	scarlett named this place wild rose farm there a few chickens clucking in a wire coop behind a muddy pasture where there is also a horse
POD1000000010_S0000011	this is one of the oldest farms in fairfield county
POD1000000010_S0000012	really
POD1000000010_S0000013	yeah the house is 1740 so older than the united states of america
POD1000000010_S0000014	we get there in time to watch her feed the animals including her constant companions 3 dogs remington rocky and olive
POD1000000010_S0000015	he is hungry too
POD1000000010_S0000016	i think he thought that the mike was a dog watch out
POD1000000010_S0000017	so scarlett leads us inside the house and i remember we took our jackets off in the mud room and hanging there was a 1st grader is black and blue ski jacket
POD1000000010_S0000018	and scarlett stopped and she pulled out a pair of these funny looking teeth out of the pocket joke teeth
POD1000000010_S0000019	i always say that he wore these little teeth cause he was such a goofball to school every day
POD1000000010_S0000020	little silver teeth
POD1000000010_S0000021	yeah
POD1000000010_S0000022	
POD1000000010_S0000023	scarlett is son jesse had these teeth in this coat at sandy hook elementary school the day he died
POD1000000010_S0000024	my name is scarlett lewis and i am the founder of the jesse lewis choose love movement
POD1000000010_S0000025	and i founded this organization following the murder of my 6 year old son alongside 19 of his classmates and 6 educators in one of the worst mass murders in u s history
POD1000000010_S0000026	here in sandy hook connecticut in 2012 scarlett lived through every parent is nightmare
POD1000000010_S0000027	and following that i realized that there is not a they out there
POD1000000010_S0000028	and by they she means someone else who is going to come into our schools and our homes and help kids replace their anger and violence with warmth and compassion
POD1000000010_S0000029	right then we come into the sunny kitchen which is painted turquoise and bright yellow
POD1000000010_S0000030	every surface is covered with paintings scarlett is done and photos of jesse and his brother j t
POD1000000010_S0000031	and one of the cabinets has chalkboard paint on it and on it is a message from jesse
POD1000000010_S0000032	we we hardly ever use this this is spray painted chalkboard
POD1000000010_S0000033	scarlett did not notice this message until she returned to the house several days after the shooting to find clothes for jesse to wear in his casket
POD1000000010_S0000034	she walked in and froze
POD1000000010_S0000035	i saw that nurturing healing love and i could not believe it
POD1000000010_S0000036	nurturing healing love you can see those 3 words they are spelled phonetically in a 6 year old is jagged scrawl
POD1000000010_S0000037	i thought it would never be able to come back here i do not know why i am crying cause usually i do not sorry
POD1000000010_S0000038	i am usually really good at keeping it together just give me a moment
POD1000000010_S0000040	scarlett says she has no idea how or where her little boy came up with those 3 words
POD1000000010_S0000041	but the moment she saw them she realized
POD1000000010_S0000042	this is my life now i knew i would be spending the rest of my life spreading this message
POD1000000010_S0000043	and by the way 6 years later you can tell what a moment it was because it is all i talk about it is all i do
POD1000000010_S0000044	it is the focus of my life every waking moment every breath every word that comes out of my mouth is about nurturing healing love really

POD1000000010_S0000059	so cory yes kindness is important but i guess i always just assumed that my kids would learn it naturally through osmosis
POD1000000010_S0000060	just if you love them they will become kind
POD1000000010_S0000061	well you know what anya you are not alone in that assumption
POD1000000010_S0000062	we often just expect people to be kind without talking about it
POD1000000010_S0000063	we think 0 you are a good kid you are going to be kind
POD1000000010_S0000064	that is jennifer kotler she is one of our expert guides today through what turns out to be a pretty complicated subject
POD1000000010_S0000065	kindness has been a part of sesame street from the beginning so it is not a new concept but
POD1000000010_S0000066	but she says the folks at sesame and lots of child development experts are starting to notice things warnings
POD1000000010_S0000067	not only in the headlines but in research
POD1000000010_S0000068	and that brings us to our 1st takeaway that parents and teachers are sending kids really mixed messages about kindness
POD1000000010_S0000069	exhibit a is this study jen points to out of harvard a few years back
POD1000000010_S0000070	middle school children for example thought that their parents valued academic success over kindness
POD1000000010_S0000071	in fact about 80% of children believed their parents were more concerned about good grades and their kids careers than whether they were caring towards others
POD1000000010_S0000072	80% and the parents on the other hand they got surveyed too
POD1000000010_S0000073	and they did not realize this they they were totally wrong about the message that they thought their kids were getting
POD1000000010_S0000074	yeah and this kind of like self delusion this is just one of many reasons scarlett worries that this culture is creating huge problems
POD1000000010_S0000075	now at epidemic levels
POD1000000010_S0000076	and i am not talking about just school violence and bullying and loneliness but also substance abuse and mental illness
POD1000000010_S0000077	and of course her life is a really stark reminder cory of just how high the stakes can be when we talk about things like mental health and kids who are troubled
POD1000000010_S0000078	sometimes it is frustrating for me because we act like we do not know what to do
POD1000000010_S0000079	and we do know what to do
POD1000000010_S0000080	after she read that message from jesse scarlett lewis reached out to a team of researchers and educators and she created a plan to essentially teach children kindness step by step value by value
POD1000000010_S0000081	yeah the jesse lewis choose love enrichment program they estimate it is now reached over a 1000000 students
POD1000000010_S0000082	in fact in the past decade or so schools all over the country have woken up to the idea that they have a responsibility to teach kids how to treat each other
POD1000000010_S0000083	yeah and not just to prevent the next tragedy but also because research tells us that these non academic skills often called social and emotional skills
POD1000000010_S0000084	they make up about half of the equation that determines whether kids are going to be successful in their lives
POD1000000010_S0000085	so let us follow scarlett is lead and sesame street is and talk about how the science of kindness can translate into action
POD1000000010_S0000087	takeaway number 2
POD1000000010_S0000088	kids are born to be kind
POD1000000010_S0000089	but also unkind
POD1000000010_S0000090	here is what we mean
POD1000000010_S0000091	so on the one hand people have neurons in our brains called mirror neurons and they respond in the same way when we experience pain like we are picked by a needle as we do when we watch someone else experience pain
POD1000000010_S0000092	it is a mirror
POD1000000010_S0000093	it lights up the same receptors in our brain as physical pain
POD1000000010_S0000094	soon after birth children for example will be more likely to cry as a result of hearing another child cry than they are in response to any other sort of noise
POD1000000010_S0000095	thomas lickona says we see signs of what is called empathic distress even in tiny babies
POD1000000010_S0000096	he is a psychologist who wrote the book on how to raise kind kids literally
POD1000000010_S0000097	that is what it is called he is also been a family counselor has 2 kids and 15 grandkids
POD1000000010_S0000098	and tom told us that babies moral sense seems to go even deeper
POD1000000010_S0000099	studies going back to the late 1990s have found infants as young as 3 months old prefer a kind or helper puppet over a mean aggressive character
POD1000000010_S0000100	so this is like i was saying cory i always thought kids are just born to be kind
POD1000000010_S0000101	yeah but the problem for kids is that there are also a lot of barriers to kindness
POD1000000010_S0000102	for example there is a small study of 2 year olds who were exposed to another child is distress say a friend fell down on the playground
POD1000000010_S0000103	only about a 3rd of the kids actually responded in that moment with altruism with kindness by say going over to the child offering a hug calling for an adult
POD1000000010_S0000104	zachary
POD1000000010_S0000106	let us check on him bella he is trying to check on you
POD1000000010_S0000107	he is trying to help you up
POD1000000010_S0000108	yeah and we actually saw this kind of scene in person on a recent trip that we took to a preschool on the campus of eastern connecticut state university
POD1000000010_S0000109	i am going to help bella
POD1000000010_S0000110	0 great let us see
POD1000000010_S0000111	what a kind friend
POD1000000010_S0000112	let me help you bella
POD1000000010_S0000114	and it really got me wondering would my kids be that one in 3 would yours
POD1000000010_S0000115	yeah i do not know i mean i really hope so
POD1000000010_S0000116	but what is it that gets in the way of that kindness that act of kindness in the moment
POD1000000010_S0000117	a bunch of things
POD1000000010_S0000118	young kids are naturally self centered
POD1000000010_S0000119	sure
POD1000000010_S0000120	every parent knows that
POD1000000010_S0000121	so they might just be oblivious to another child is pain
POD1000000010_S0000122	you know and there is also individual temperament right
POD1000000010_S0000123	so some kids
POD1000000010_S0000124	they really can not handle other kids pain they they shut down
POD1000000010_S0000125	or maybe they are really shy they are waiting for someone else to step up
POD1000000010_S0000126	you know decades of psychology research tells us this is a grown up problem too
POD1000000010_S0000127	sometimes the presence of others automatically serves as an inhibition
POD1000000010_S0000128	but there is also another more disturbing barrier to kindness that adults really need to understand here and it is prejudice
POD1000000010_S0000129	so there is another yale study of 6 to 8 month old babies
POD1000000010_S0000130	
POD1000000010_S0000131	they wanted a puppet that did not share their snack preference punished
POD1000000010_S0000132	punished
POD1000000010_S0000133	yeah so it is not just that these babies showed a preference for those who look or behave or think like they do but also a kind of hostility to those that do not
POD1000000010_S0000134	wow
POD1000000010_S0000135	yeah so for all these reasons children and grown ups alike do not always reach out to help
POD1000000010_S0000136	instead we often do the opposite
POD1000000010_S0000137	it is true we hide from other people is pain we run away from responsibility
POD1000000010_S0000138	and that is why scarlett says
POD1000000010_S0000139	you do not really need the skills and tools
POD1000000010_S0000140	what you need is the courage to be with somebody in pain and just be present
POD1000000010_S0000142	and that is our 3rd takeaway
POD1000000010_S0000143	kindness requires courage
POD1000000010_S0000144	the jesse lewis choose love program for kids from pre k through high school actually begins with courage
POD1000000010_S0000145	and i want to mention that reports of the shooting said that jesse himself showed incredible courage
POD1000000010_S0000146	when the shooter stopped to reload he yelled run and the investigators said that he saved many of his classmates lives in that moment
POD1000000010_S0000147	yeah and scarlett is definition of courage is even bigger than that sort of
POD1000000010_S0000149	courage
POD1000000010_S0000151	heroic courage
POD1000000010_S0000152	for her it includes the courage to reach out to a hurting friend on the playground or or a child you do not even know
POD1000000010_S0000153	yeah absolutely i i mean the courage to offer comfort to someone who is lost a loved one even if the idea of death is really scary to you
POD1000000010_S0000154	it is also scarlett says the courage to stand up to someone who is bullying you or someone you know by taking their perspective and seeing the world through their eyes
POD1000000010_S0000155	gosh you know what would make you act that way
POD1000000010_S0000156	what is going on in your life
POD1000000010_S0000157	i feel compassion for you
POD1000000010_S0000158	i see the pain
POD1000000010_S0000159	is there anything that i can do to help ease that pain
POD1000000010_S0000160	you know hearing about courage in that way in that moment really spoke to me cory because i have to admit this
POD1000000010_S0000161	i was a little afraid to sit down with scarlett
POD1000000010_S0000162	i mean someone who had gone through something that i as a parent fear so much and to look that pain in the face
POD1000000010_S0000163	but the way that she has transformed that experience into a positive legacy is is so inspiring
POD1000000010_S0000165	one really practical way scarlett is choose love plan builds courage is by teaching kids to stay calm
POD1000000010_S0000166	they practice brave poses and brave breaths to stand up tall like superheroes and calm down their bodies and their minds
POD1000000010_S0000167	yeah there are few different reasons for this which make up our 4th takeaway
POD1000000010_S0000168	yeah takeaway number 4
POD1000000010_S0000169	kindness takes mindfulness
POD1000000010_S0000170	jen kotler at sesame says if you are more aware of your emotions you will also be more aware of everyone else is
POD1000000010_S0000171	and you will be less likely to lash out violently in frustration or anger
POD1000000010_S0000172	self regulation is something we all struggle with
POD1000000010_S0000173	and that is why mindfulness is so important and really learning how to manage our own emotions
POD1000000010_S0000174	and i think the earlier that we can practice those skills the better we will be in adulthood
POD1000000010_S0000175	in fact the folks at sesame are so convinced of the connection between mindfulness and kindness that they like to use a special word kindfulness
POD1000000010_S0000176	you hear that merriam webster
POD1000000010_S0000178	anyway lots of the social and emotional learning programs introduce tools like meditation relaxation yoga to help kids work on this body mind connection
POD1000000010_S0000179	so we talked about the courage that it takes to step in when someone else is hurting even if that person is being hurtful towards you
POD1000000010_S0000180	and how to cultivate that quiet in your mind that lets you do that
POD1000000010_S0000181	our next takeaway is about what to do when your child hurts someone else accidentally or intentionally
POD1000000010_S0000182	or on the other hand when someone else hurts your child
POD1000000010_S0000183	takeaway number 5
POD1000000010_S0000184	apologies are a skill
POD1000000010_S0000185	and forgiveness is a gift you give yourself
POD1000000010_S0000186	yeah before jen started at sesame workshop she spent her days in a classroom
POD1000000010_S0000187	i remember when i was a preschool teacher briefly that we were told we do not force children to apologize to each other
POD1000000010_S0000188	and i remember in my early 20s thinking that is absurd
POD1000000010_S0000189	you should totally tell children to apologize to each other
POD1000000010_S0000190	the problem jen found out with forced apologies as that they are usually pretty worthless
POD1000000010_S0000191	sorry
POD1000000010_S0000192	they do not even realize that that they are supposed to mean it you know or feel it
POD1000000010_S0000193	yeah so tom lickona and jen kotler both told us instead of focusing on kids parroting the words sorry
POD1000000010_S0000194	we should help them really take the other person is perspective and this is important repair the harm done
POD1000000010_S0000195	yeah and this is a great tip
POD1000000010_S0000196	jen says you can actually take a moment like this
POD1000000010_S0000197	and direct one child to look at the other child is face and posture
POD1000000010_S0000198	and this helps them learn how to read feelings
POD1000000010_S0000199	so it is really about more conversations and about looking at emotions and emotion knowledge and looking at faces to see how your actions affect other people
POD1000000010_S0000200	jen says sesame street has improved over time in how it depicts apologies on the show
POD1000000010_S0000201	it now has characters discuss what went wrong and why and how to make it better
POD1000000010_S0000202	so elmo might say i was really wanting to play with my scooter and i did not want to share it
POD1000000010_S0000203	and i realized that you probably wanted a turn too
POD1000000010_S0000204	and i should let you have the time with it
POD1000000010_S0000206	you will get it zoe
POD1000000010_S0000207	but but but wait what about your turn elmo
POD1000000010_S0000208	elmo elmo can be patient and wait for his turn
POD1000000010_S0000209	so what do you say zoe
POD1000000010_S0000210	and then the other character would say yes that is how i was feeling that you were not sharing
POD1000000010_S0000211	and it was hurting my feelings and then when you shared it made me feel better
POD1000000010_S0000212	yeah
POD1000000010_S0000214	all right nice job sharing elmo
POD1000000010_S0000215	all right thanks
POD1000000010_S0000216	so in that interaction you are giving children a lot of language to describe how they are feeling
POD1000000010_S0000217	that may be a lot to expect from a 2 year old
POD1000000010_S0000218	but you know apologies are a skill kind of like learning to scooter
POD1000000010_S0000219	and they improve with practice
POD1000000010_S0000220	yeah and starting these kinds of conversations early is crucial to raising a child who runs to help when somebody is hurt
POD1000000010_S0000221	so remember that small study we mentioned of kids on the playground
POD1000000010_S0000222	well it also looked in depth at the parenting styles of their mothers in different situations
POD1000000010_S0000223	when one child hurt another many of the mothers responded with something casual and bland
POD1000000010_S0000224	yeah like 0 do not do that
POD1000000010_S0000225	but the researchers found that the moms of the helper kids those one in 3 who ran to help they were different
POD1000000010_S0000226	yeah they were warm and nurturing but they also took it really seriously when their child hurt another child
POD1000000010_S0000227	so they would say something like
POD1000000010_S0000228	you hurt amy
POD1000000010_S0000229	pulling hair hurts never pull hair
POD1000000010_S0000230	and as a result the child was more likely to take it seriously later on and respond compassionately when she saw another child crying on the playground
POD1000000010_S0000231	tom also says that children should learn to make an apology of action
POD1000000010_S0000232	what we grown ups might call restitution if you break something you fix it whether it is a broken toy or a hurt feeling
POD1000000010_S0000233	this is also where things get hard for us grown ups too
POD1000000010_S0000234	yeah
POD1000000010_S0000235	because all the experts we spoke with were really clear kids do what they see
POD1000000010_S0000236	and scarlett lewis says that means when parents screw up we need to apologize too
POD1000000010_S0000237	wow mom made a mistake you know
POD1000000010_S0000238	and i misinterpreted what just happened here
POD1000000010_S0000239	and i got angry i am sorry you know can you guys forgive me
POD1000000010_S0000240	if anything scarlett talks even more about the other side of an apology forgiveness
POD1000000010_S0000241	that is one of the 4 core values of her choose love program along with courage
POD1000000010_S0000242	and she says when she 1st pitched the program people were not sure about forgiveness
POD1000000010_S0000243	that is a very lofty topic for kids
POD1000000010_S0000244	do not you think that is a little too complicated
POD1000000010_S0000245	not at all she says
POD1000000010_S0000246	the choose love classrooms have turned forgiveness into a hands on exercise
POD1000000010_S0000247	we literally take string and scissors and we cut the cord because that is how i talk about it
POD1000000010_S0000248	like if you are angry at somebody you are attached to them with an umbilical cord
POD1000000010_S0000249	and it runs out of your side into the side of the person that you are angry at
POD1000000010_S0000250	i love this too because scarlett is really focusing on the benefit of letting go of anger
POD1000000010_S0000251	and she says you know holding onto anger it can be as bad for your health as smoking cigarettes
POD1000000010_S0000252	and it was at this point where sitting with scarlett in her kitchen her back is to her refrigerator which is covered with photos of jesse and her other son j t and we just had to ask
POD1000000010_S0000253	we have been talking about forgiveness
POD1000000010_S0000254	did she forgive the person who murdered her son
POD1000000010_S0000255	absolutely
POD1000000010_S0000257	without hesitation yeah i i without hesitation i absolutely forgive him
POD1000000010_S0000259	so we have been talking about kindness in the darkest hours those moments of conflict
POD1000000010_S0000260	loss and pain hurt and anger
POD1000000010_S0000261	and those are really important
POD1000000010_S0000262	i mean that is when you really need kindness
POD1000000010_S0000263	yeah but how do you build kindness up
POD1000000010_S0000264	well if you want to really grow kind people there is a lot you can do when things are good when you are full of joy
POD1000000010_S0000265	that is our takeaway number 6 kindness grows with sunlight
POD1000000010_S0000266	what do we mean by that
POD1000000010_S0000267	you have the raise the capital of kindness
POD1000000010_S0000268	aija simmons helps run the social and emotional programs for schools in oakland california
POD1000000010_S0000269	and she focused a lot on kindness when she taught elementary school
POD1000000010_S0000270	you have to point it out
POD1000000010_S0000271	you have to name it
POD1000000010_S0000272	you have to appreciate it when you see it
POD1000000010_S0000273	for example every day she would hold circle time
POD1000000010_S0000274	and a lot of times she would ask this
POD1000000010_S0000275	you know what were some ways this week where your classmates were kind to you
POD1000000010_S0000276	turn and share a moment where you felt someone was being really kind
POD1000000010_S0000277	tom lickona says it is not just about celebrating kind actions
POD1000000010_S0000278	it is encouraging kids to identify as kind people
POD1000000010_S0000279	yeah because people are more likely to be kind if they see it as part of who they are
POD1000000010_S0000280	yeah this idea of taking special notice when people are kind to you well another word for that could be gratitude
POD1000000010_S0000281	yeah part of how scarlett keeps going she told us is by constantly reminding herself even out loud what she is grateful for
POD1000000010_S0000282	my gratitude lists are all day long
POD1000000010_S0000283	and i start in the morning by ticking off the sun is out and i can get up out of bed and literally like i am ticking them off all day
POD1000000010_S0000284	and when you are focused on gratitude you are not focused on the lesser energy thoughts
POD1000000010_S0000285	and tom agrees
POD1000000010_S0000286	there is a payoff to practicing gratitude in this way
POD1000000010_S0000287	not only can raise the stock of kindness in your family in your classroom but research shows that people who are thankful are also happier
POD1000000010_S0000288	yeah he suggests that at mealtimes for example families go around and mention their gratefuls things that they are thankful for that day
POD1000000010_S0000289	yeah we do this in my house
POD1000000010_S0000291	all right who wants to go 1st
POD1000000010_S0000292	me i am thankful for animals and pandas
POD1000000010_S0000293	thank you for this food and this day and that my concert is today
POD1000000010_S0000294	it is not always easy
POD1000000010_S0000295	sometimes my guys do not really want to do it they just want to eat
POD1000000010_S0000296	thank you for this breakfast
POD1000000010_S0000297	and
POD1000000010_S0000298	but we do it
POD1000000010_S0000299	the point of all this is to really carve out a time in each day for your kids and you to acknowledge you know we are not self sufficient
POD1000000010_S0000300	we are not islands
POD1000000010_S0000301	we need other people and other people need us
POD1000000010_S0000302	that is a great point cory i have got to try that
POD1000000010_S0000304	we have come to our final takeaway takeaway number 7 kindness requires
POD1000000010_S0000305	practice practice practice
POD1000000010_S0000306	yeah in fact scarlett lewis says
POD1000000010_S0000307	we were going to change the name of our program from choose love enrichment program to choose love enrichment practice
POD1000000010_S0000308	and similarly tom says kindness as a virtue is not random it is a habit
POD1000000010_S0000309	and that is not just calling out kindness when you see it in your kids
POD1000000010_S0000310	it is giving them lots of opportunities to be kind you know
POD1000000010_S0000311	and you can start with chores at home
POD1000000010_S0000312	chores yeah that is a really good idea
POD1000000010_S0000313	so tom says you know not for an allowance but just to give the message that this is what we do to help out because we are part of something bigger
POD1000000010_S0000314	and for my daughter lulu who is 7 that chore really is taking care of the cat
POD1000000010_S0000315	you know when we got the cat she promised that she would help out not only with the feeding but also the litter box
POD1000000010_S0000316	this is really giving her the message that there is another creature depending on her
POD1000000010_S0000317	yeah totally
POD1000000010_S0000318	and you can also and should you know take this model this idea and take it out into your community
POD1000000010_S0000319	you know have your kids help pick up trash in the neighborhood or help folks at a shelter
POD1000000010_S0000320	raise money for a good cause whatever it is
POD1000000010_S0000322	and here is the really good news tom told us
POD1000000010_S0000323	getting our kids to be helpers to be in service it does not just benefit the grown ups that they become
POD1000000010_S0000324	doing this regularly actually feels good chemically
POD1000000010_S0000325	it is what brain researchers call helper is high
POD1000000010_S0000326	doing a kind act lights up a part of the brain that let us us experience joy
POD1000000010_S0000327	and that is why he says we are happier when we are helping and jen at sesame agrees
POD1000000010_S0000328	kindness really does make you feel good
POD1000000010_S0000329	and that is why scarlett says we should talk to kids directly about this helper is high
POD1000000010_S0000330	there is so much science that shows and i say all the nurturing healing love that you give out you get back
POD1000000010_S0000331	so this is getting me thinking more about that study of middle school students that we opened the episode with
POD1000000010_S0000332	
POD1000000010_S0000333	you know our kids they hear from us every day do your homework
POD1000000010_S0000334	study for the test
POD1000000010_S0000335	how well did you do
POD1000000010_S0000336	and they hear us talk about sweating some promotion or working hard on a project
POD1000000010_S0000337	but you know do we ever stop and ask them were you kind in class today
POD1000000010_S0000338	yeah did you help somebody who was hurting or sit by that kid who always eats alone
POD1000000010_S0000339	it is no wonder our kids so often think that we value grades more than kindness
POD1000000010_S0000340	so i am thinking more about how to raise the capital of kindness at home
POD1000000010_S0000341	and we have gone through these great strategies right
POD1000000010_S0000342	yeah yeah i mean the the goal here everyone we talked to said this said this word
POD1000000010_S0000343	they used the word culture
POD1000000010_S0000344	you have to create a culture of kindness whether you are talking about home or the classroom or anywhere
POD1000000010_S0000346	time for a recap anya
POD1000000010_S0000347	all right i am feeling love let us do it
POD1000000010_S0000348	alright
POD1000000010_S0000349	here we go takeaway number one
POD1000000010_S0000350	we grown ups seem to stop sending our kids mixed messages about kindness
POD1000000010_S0000351	yeah we say we want our kids to be kind but we have got to walk the walk
POD1000000010_S0000352	takeaway number 2 kids are born to be kind but also unkind
POD1000000010_S0000353	yeah so empathy is part of what makes us human but and this is a big but
POD1000000010_S0000354	there is a difference between feeling someone else is pain and actually acting to help
POD1000000010_S0000355	yeah kindness is not just a feeling it is an action
POD1000000010_S0000356	and that is why our takeaway number 3 is kindness requires courage
POD1000000010_S0000357	the courage to embrace other people is pain the courage to put other people is needs before your own
POD1000000010_S0000358	but also courage to see someone who is hurt you or a friend or someone in your family not as a bully
POD1000000010_S0000359	but as someone who is struggling
POD1000000010_S0000360	the kind of courage to see the world the way scarlett lewis does
POD1000000010_S0000361	there are only 2 kinds of people in the world good people and good people in pain
POD1000000010_S0000362	takeaway number 4 to build kindness practice mindfulness
POD1000000010_S0000363	being able to stay calm and patient will help you every time
POD1000000010_S0000364	especially when someone hurts you
POD1000000010_S0000365	so takeaway number 5 is apologies are a skill and forgiveness is a gift you give yourself
POD1000000010_S0000366	remember parents and teachers alike the old singsongy sorry it is not good enough
POD1000000010_S0000367	and when you are on the other side of the harm forgiveness may feel hard but it will also feel good in the long run
POD1000000010_S0000368	speaking of feeling good our takeaway number 6 is kindness grows with sunlight
POD1000000010_S0000369	or as jen at sesame says
POD1000000010_S0000370	we often are quick to tell children when they are doing something wrong and trying to correct them from doing something wrong
POD1000000010_S0000371	instead can we spend more time catching them doing something right catching them doing something kind
POD1000000010_S0000372	so create a culture of kindness and gratitude recognition of kindness in your home and in your classroom
POD1000000010_S0000373	and takeaway number 6 kindness takes practice
POD1000000010_S0000374	and grown ups can help with that by creating opportunities for your kids to be kind
POD1000000010_S0000375	whether that is chores at home or family service projects out in the community
POD1000000010_S0000377	and that is all for this episode of life kit for parenting with sesame workshop

POD1000000014_S0000011	peter you are extremely welcome thank you for being with us
POD1000000014_S0000012	thank you rob very glad to be here
POD1000000014_S0000013	peter i am very interested to hear a bit about your early life
POD1000000014_S0000014	where were you born and tell us a bit about the values that were instilled in you when you grew up
POD1000000014_S0000015	thank you rob i was born in dublin i was born into a fairly ordinary working class home
POD1000000014_S0000016	my dad was a mechanic with the state transport company my mother was as was the case with many in the day a housewife
POD1000000014_S0000017	we lived a very ordinary family life
POD1000000014_S0000018	i did not enjoy school and i was taught by the christian brothers so i have some of my learning to thank them for
POD1000000014_S0000019	was i would not say they contributed to a a very happy schooldays but the rest of my childhood was very enjoyable so
POD1000000014_S0000020	my mother would have been quite religious it was a very different ireland at the time
POD1000000014_S0000021	our house was busy there were often relatives or neighbors popping in for cups of tea
POD1000000014_S0000022	and so was a a pleasant place to grow up
POD1000000014_S0000023	so you had a community service background before going to work in local government is that is that is correct is not it
POD1000000014_S0000024	yes so i i worked for the welsh housing agency when it was set up that was funding housing associations on special needs housing
POD1000000014_S0000025	but then i went to work for cardiff housing department
POD1000000014_S0000026	i was responsible for services like homelessness and sheltered housing for older people and so on
POD1000000014_S0000027	and also managed the gypsy sites in cardiff so very interesting job
POD1000000014_S0000028	but i gradually became more involved in mainstream housing through that
POD1000000014_S0000029	and then before you became welsh ombudsman you were you were chief executive of the arts council of wales was was that good fun
POD1000000014_S0000030	it was very good fun it was at a time shortly after the creation of the welsh assembly
POD1000000014_S0000031	the government in wales was interested in nation building if you like doing things to bring people together and they saw the arts as a valuable way of doing that
POD1000000014_S0000032	from my perspective obviously i was also interested in community arts and arts outreach to people who were otherwise excluded
POD1000000014_S0000033	so it fitted very well for me i i never had any expertise in the arts but i greatly enjoyed it
POD1000000014_S0000034	and it was a very good time for the arts in wales
POD1000000014_S0000035	now i think you must be one of the very few people to have occupied national ombudsman jobs in more than one country
POD1000000014_S0000036	i do not know whether there is anyone else like you in that regard but what was it like moving from being ombudsman in wales to ombudsman in in ireland
POD1000000014_S0000037	it was interesting
POD1000000014_S0000038	i think the ombudsman in wales was a very significant player in the evolution of the devolved administration in wales
POD1000000014_S0000039	but particularly the work focused within the health sphere
POD1000000014_S0000040	and an awful lot of the complaints that we dealt with were to do with clinical judgment
POD1000000014_S0000041	so moving to ireland and firstly i found that i do not have jurisdiction over clinical judgment
POD1000000014_S0000042	but also i have jurisdiction over a much broader range of government services and local government
POD1000000014_S0000043	so was similar in some ways to wales but it was a a bigger job if you like
POD1000000014_S0000044	in the context of the a whole national government and a different set of issues to deal with
POD1000000014_S0000045	in ireland you are also you wear many hats you are also the information commissioner
POD1000000014_S0000046	and you deal with local government standards as well
POD1000000014_S0000047	is is that do you find that an advantage in terms of being ombudsman
POD1000000014_S0000048	it is very helpful if you are committed to the same kinds of principles you are committed to good public services you are committed to openness you are committed to transparency
POD1000000014_S0000049	those values work across all of the different hats i wear
POD1000000014_S0000050	i suppose the biggest difference is as ombudsman you make recommendations but in ireland in the history of the office they have always been implemented
POD1000000014_S0000051	as information commissioner you make binding decisions but those get challenged in the courts
POD1000000014_S0000052	so despite what many people think to be the case being an ombudsman in some ways is more effective in terms of having outcomes achieved than having binding powers as information commissioner
POD1000000014_S0000053	what would you say have been the biggest challenges to you as irish ombudsman
POD1000000014_S0000054	you have obviously successfully dealt with them because you have been reappointed for a 2nd term but looking back on the 6 years that you have had what what are the biggest challenges
POD1000000014_S0000055	the biggest challenge we faced was with the investigation into the magdalene laundries
POD1000000014_S0000056	as we looked more closely at the issues there this was about women who had been held against their will
POD1000000014_S0000057	often young women who would had babies sometimes schoolchildren who had been held against their will and forced to work for many years in laundries
POD1000000014_S0000058	what i was looking at was a government compensation scheme and the department of justice had chosen to interpret that scheme very narrowly
POD1000000014_S0000059	so they were excluding young women people who at the time were young women and had worked in the laundries but been detained in industrial schools
POD1000000014_S0000060	which shared the same sites as the laundries but not technically resident in the laundries
POD1000000014_S0000061	so we looked at that and felt that there was a huge injustice but the initial response of the department was to reject our findings
POD1000000014_S0000062	so that required a high publicity campaign which ultimately led to the government changing its mind
POD1000000014_S0000063	to be fair i suspect if ministers had been involved from the outset i do not think that the rejection we initially saw would have happened
POD1000000014_S0000064	did any of the people who experienced this detriment get in touch with you or was this the nature of you seeing the unfairness and acting on their behalf
POD1000000014_S0000065	no we had a small number of cases but we investigated the whole scheme and so some of the people who benefited would not even have known of my office
POD1000000014_S0000066	so that is the advantage of having the power of own initiative to an ombudsman
POD1000000014_S0000067	yes it is you can investigate
POD1000000014_S0000068	even if you get complaints sometimes you are constrained because you can only investigate on the facts if you can not undertake own initiative investigations
POD1000000014_S0000069	if something comes up that needs to be looked at there is no constraints on me looking at that
POD1000000014_S0000070	and particularly i have found that in the context of excluded groups it is a very powerful tool to use to make sure that people who do not come to you can nonetheless have access to justice
POD1000000014_S0000071	yeah and is that regarded as controversial in ireland i would not have thought so
POD1000000014_S0000072	no no it is just part of the toolkit available to the office i do not think anybody gives it any 2nd thought
POD1000000014_S0000073	and you you behaved very bravely in in this investigation because at one point when you were being blocked by ministers you threatened to go to the
POD1000000014_S0000075	is that is that right
POD1000000014_S0000076	when i was being blocked by officials i went to the minister for justice and through him to the
POD1000000014_S0000078	the prime minister
POD1000000014_S0000079	i asked that they personally look to resolve the matter because it was such a a stark injustice some reflected very poorly on the government of ireland
POD1000000014_S0000081	gone the minister for justice both acted with great expediency and the matter was resolved almost immediately following their intervention
POD1000000014_S0000082	i do not think you can be an effective ombudsman without having the kind of guts that you have shown throughout this
POD1000000014_S0000083	and the i hope you will sympathize with those ombudsmen that do not have own initiative powers because it seems to me to be a great hand
POD1000000014_S0000084	i do not think it is i mean even in a welsh context where i did not have them at the time
POD1000000014_S0000085	you could be investigating something in one health board and see immediately that it was likely that the same problems were arising elsewhere
POD1000000014_S0000086	but technically you could not extend your investigation beyond the body you were investigating
POD1000000014_S0000087	that ability to extend an investigation to cover whichever bodies are involved is very powerful
POD1000000014_S0000088	so a lot of my work let us say with asylum seekers and refugees in accommodation provided on behalf of the government
POD1000000014_S0000089	and i will be looking at complaints that are to do with healthcare that are to do with access to benefits that are to do with all kinds of things access to housing
POD1000000014_S0000090	other than the services provided by the department of justice in providing the accommodation
POD1000000014_S0000091	so it is just that capacity to broaden out an investigation as well as the capacity to instigate an investigation where you do not have complaints
POD1000000014_S0000092	now my current own initiative investigation is looking at the situation of people under 65 living in nursing homes
POD1000000014_S0000093	that is become a much more pressing issue and the coronavirus crisis one of the people we have interviewed has already died another has contracted the virus
POD1000000014_S0000094	so although at this point it is not possible for obvious reasons to conclude the investigation
POD1000000014_S0000095	what we have done is written to the leaders of all the political parties who are currently involved and talks leading to the formation of a new government
POD1000000014_S0000096	to highlight the issue of people in institutional care so that at least what we have learnt to date in the course of our investigation can hopefully help to shape the policies of the incoming government
POD1000000014_S0000097	can we just move on a little bit
POD1000000014_S0000098	you you are the president of the international ombudsman institute which is a very important and prestigious job which is very valuable to ombudsmen all over the world
POD1000000014_S0000099	what added value do you think the i 0 i brings to to our discussions
POD1000000014_S0000100	well i think one the very important things is straightforwardly learning from each other
POD1000000014_S0000101	being an ombudsman is necessarily an isolated role what you can not do is be too close to the people in the services which are within your jurisdiction
POD1000000014_S0000102	so consequently we have more in common with each other than we do with the people whose services we are looking at and learning from each other is very important
POD1000000014_S0000103	the i 0 i provides structured training opportunities that has been one of the the very valuable things we have done
POD1000000014_S0000104	it provides best practice papers to show how things can best be done
POD1000000014_S0000105	and of course rob you yourself have been responsible for the best practice paper on on peer review and the work you have done in that field
POD1000000014_S0000106	and but also i think the i 0 i has played a big part in supporting ombudsman organizations under threat
POD1000000014_S0000107	we have seen for instance colleagues in many countries around the world who because they are doing their job are being threatened or ignored by their governments
POD1000000014_S0000108	and we have seen things like budgets being cut and we have seen people being denounced by government ministers and so on
POD1000000014_S0000109	so the solidarity of the international ombudsman community is very important but we also intervene quite directly
POD1000000014_S0000110	i give an example of cyprus where the auditor general was looking to interfere in the work of the ombudsman is office
POD1000000014_S0000111	following intervention from the i 0 i and others with the government of cyprus and the parliament in particular the threats were withdrawn
POD1000000014_S0000112	and in poland the ombudsman was threatened with large cuts to his budget we sent in a commission of inquiry
POD1000000014_S0000113	we interviewed government ministers we interviewed the judiciary
POD1000000014_S0000114	and we carried out press conferences we talked to n g os and we managed to get a stay of execution
POD1000000014_S0000115	and so we saw major threats to democracy there but our intervention along with those of others has helped to ensure that that office is still there and is continuing to operate effectively
POD1000000014_S0000116	that polish intervention was crucial
POD1000000014_S0000117	and what is one of the remarkable things about it was you actually went there did not just talk about it
POD1000000014_S0000118	but you put the political institutions under pressure by asking them to give an account of what they were doing
POD1000000014_S0000119	absolutely so we did that in person and we did it through the media so that it had a very high profile within poland i think it is it is no good
POD1000000014_S0000120	i did the same in cyprus media interviews and talk to people on the ground
POD1000000014_S0000121	i think it is really important that solidarity is not something that comes just in the form of the letter though sometimes a letter can be effective enough in itself
POD1000000014_S0000122	but that you actually scale the intervention to the nature of the challenge
POD1000000014_S0000123	we we have talked about this quite a lot when we have not been on the radio but
POD1000000014_S0000124	how important do you think it is that we as ombuds do not get involved in political matters
POD1000000014_S0000125	or do you think this is a cultural relic of british imperialism
POD1000000014_S0000127	whatever about british imperialism no i think it is a very complex question
POD1000000014_S0000128	i think that for an ombudsman not to be involved in politics is scarcely possible because what we are actually doing is overseeing the services provided by the state
POD1000000014_S0000129	and so therefore any comment we make on those services has the potential to be political
POD1000000014_S0000130	what we can not be is party political and what we can not do is speak beyond the evidence of our casebook
POD1000000014_S0000131	so i talked earlier on about seeking to effect the formation of the government in ireland to to promote particular policies to favor disadvantaged groups of people
POD1000000014_S0000132	but i am doing that on the basis of investigations i am carrying out
POD1000000014_S0000133	i am not doing it as peter tyndall citizen i am doing it as ombudsman of ireland based on the evidence from my casebook
POD1000000014_S0000134	and under those circumstances i think it is entirely appropriate to intervene
POD1000000014_S0000135	i think it becomes problematic if people are seen to be intervening on issues which go beyond their own work as ombudsman
POD1000000014_S0000136	i think that is where it would become problematic
POD1000000014_S0000137	but i do think that if you have got evidence that it is important that you use that evidence where it can be most effective in securing justice for the people who have come to you
POD1000000014_S0000138	so we are moving towards the end but i wanted to ask you about how you are coping with the coronavirus
POD1000000014_S0000139	what sort of impact has it had short term and longer term on on the way you operate
POD1000000014_S0000140	yes it is an interesting one
POD1000000014_S0000141	the the 1st thing was that we surprised ourselves by being able to get ourselves in a position to work remotely much quicker than we might have done otherwise
POD1000000014_S0000142	i suppose if it is proved anything it is that when there is a crisis it is surprising how long term problems can be solved in a hurry
POD1000000014_S0000143	and so we have been able to operate all of our services more or less without change throughout the crisis
POD1000000014_S0000144	we have had some changes in volumes of work coming to us
POD1000000014_S0000145	we have put a bit more emphasis on project work but by and large people are able to make their complaints to us
POD1000000014_S0000146	they can ring us they can email us
POD1000000014_S0000147	they can contact us on the web
POD1000000014_S0000148	we are even able to collect our post though we are discouraging people from using the post at the moment but the effect of that is that we can keep going
POD1000000014_S0000149	the difficulties we face are probably more to do with the difficulties being faced by the services we are dealing with
POD1000000014_S0000150	so we have told the health service we have told nursing homes and we have told the department of social protection which deals with benefits and pensions
POD1000000014_S0000151	that we understand that it will take them longer to respond to us and that in some instances they will not be able to
POD1000000014_S0000152	so so we understand that and but in general we have been able to keep going
POD1000000014_S0000153	just give an example of the kind of things we have been dealing with
POD1000000014_S0000154	we had one gentleman stuck in poland who could not get back to ireland who had been denied benefit in ireland even though his wife and children were in ireland and he normally lived and worked
POD1000000014_S0000155	and we were able to intervene successfully so that he got his benefits so we are able to deal with issues as they arise
POD1000000014_S0000156	i think in the longer term there will be 2 things really one of them is just practical
POD1000000014_S0000157	we now know that it is possible for more of our people to work effectively from home and i can not see us going back to the situation before where only a very small number of people did that
POD1000000014_S0000158	i think more people will work from home as a consequence of what we have learnt during the crisis
POD1000000014_S0000159	but the 2nd issue for me has been the appalling death toll among people in institutional care many of whom should not be there
POD1000000014_S0000160	and i think we have to redouble our efforts in working on their behalf after the crisis to make sure that should there be a resurgence or should something else like this come along
POD1000000014_S0000161	that they are not as exposed and as vulnerable as they are at the moment
POD1000000014_S0000162	it it makes complete sense for the ombudsman to be looking at both health and social care matters
POD1000000014_S0000163	and not as in this country to have a separation where one ombudsman looks at social care and the other looks at health
POD1000000014_S0000164	i i will just if i may rob just add something
POD1000000014_S0000165	one the things that is noticeably different between ireland and the u k and england in particular is that there is a single national ombudsman in ireland
POD1000000014_S0000166	so that issues of health and social care can both come into my jurisdiction
POD1000000014_S0000167	the reality is these these are complex interlinked issues
POD1000000014_S0000168	i am trying to deal with them with 2 separate ombudsman offices it is complicated enough as it is
POD1000000014_S0000169	trying to do so in the context where you have m p filters
POD1000000014_S0000170	where you have different systems applying in different parts of the u k is impossibly difficult for yourselves
POD1000000014_S0000171	but you manage it very well along with the local government ombudsman
POD1000000014_S0000172	and i have to say you have managed in practice to overcome the difficulties but it is also an impossibly complex scenario for complainants
POD1000000014_S0000173	in ireland somebody wants to complain about public services they come to my office
POD1000000014_S0000174	in your case it is much more complicated
POD1000000014_S0000175	and i do hope that the proposals for ombudsman reform that we have seen in in the u k over recent years are not entirely lost
POD1000000014_S0000176	and that we do come to a much more satisfactory situation where there is a proper national ombudsman and where people can bring their complaints regardless of what particular public service they are complaining about
POD1000000014_S0000177	and i do hope that happens before i die which i am increasingly becoming doubtful about but we will we will have to wait and see
POD1000000014_S0000178	peter you conducted the peer review of my organization and then you appeared before the select committee in parliament
POD1000000014_S0000179	so that was not an expected development
POD1000000014_S0000180	what what was it like being being the peer reviewer who had to go before the u k parliament
POD1000000014_S0000181	it was an interesting experience robert
POD1000000014_S0000182	i think it would have been much more challenging if i had not been quite so impressed by the quality of the service your office provides
POD1000000014_S0000183	it was not as though when we looked at the service we used a lot of objective criteria
POD1000000014_S0000184	and obviously with any office there is room for improvement but in general i was able to give reassurance to the committee as the quality of service that complainants were receiving
POD1000000014_S0000185	but also to highlight some of the deficiencies in powers and in jurisdiction that are causing you difficulties in practice
POD1000000014_S0000186	but then i suppose what i would want to say i was very impressed by the quality of the people in your office
POD1000000014_S0000187	and it was a very good experience they were very open with us
POD1000000014_S0000188	we talked to your staff without talking to yourself to the managers so we were able for people to express a view as they so fit and i think people were very complementary
POD1000000014_S0000189	so i think as i say it was an an interesting experience
POD1000000014_S0000190	it is always challenging to go before parliamentary committees and the session was quite searching
POD1000000014_S0000191	i think the committee wanted to reassure itself that this was not some kind of hagiography
POD1000000014_S0000192	but we were satisfied in the end that we were able to say no we have looked in detail at this office
POD1000000014_S0000193	there are areas which can improve but by and large this is an improving service that is delivering good quality ombudsman service to the people of england and to the u k
POD1000000014_S0000194	well i think the structural point is that thanks to the i 0 i this this whole system of peer review looks like it has legs for the wider ombudsman community
POD1000000014_S0000195	and it is an effective and inexpensive way of adding to scrutiny of ombudsman schemes so thank you for the role that you played in pioneering that
POD1000000014_S0000196	one thing beyond that too rob is that
POD1000000014_S0000197	since the review was undertaken the i 0 i along with other bodies have worked quite hard
POD1000000014_S0000198	what the venice commission and the council of europe in developing a set of overriding principles for ombudsman offices the venice principles as they have become known
POD1000000014_S0000199	and they have now been adopted by the council of europe
POD1000000014_S0000200	and that is the 1st time there has been a proper international standard against which ombuds offices can be judged
POD1000000014_S0000201	and so i am keen to see them being used as they are being used now in the context of peer review
POD1000000014_S0000202	so that there is an objective set of internationally recognized standards against which you are measuring a particular ombudsman office
POD1000000014_S0000203	so i think that is again marks another step forward and one that i am very pleased to have seen develop
POD1000000014_S0000204	i think when i undertook the peer review of the catalonian ombudsman with my belgian counterpart
POD1000000014_S0000205	we used those very same venice principles as the benchmark against which to judge the catalonian ombudsman
POD1000000014_S0000206	and it is very helpful to have that because it is without prejudice
POD1000000014_S0000207	it applies to everyone so i think it is an important development
POD1000000014_S0000208	so 2 final questions how have you peter tyndall reacted to working remotely being at home with your family
POD1000000014_S0000209	i have enjoyed it to be honest
POD1000000014_S0000210	it has not been too frustrating the technology can be an issue from time to time but it it has not been too difficult
POD1000000014_S0000211	it it has been less difficult than i would have expected
POD1000000014_S0000212	does time goes on i think the issue of visible leadership comes into it does not it
POD1000000014_S0000213	so you know you actually want to to be with your people again but but it works surprisingly well
POD1000000014_S0000214	and
POD1000000014_S0000215	as i say i think for the office itself i think we will see more remote working in the future
POD1000000014_S0000216	thank you so lastly then it is what i always ask my guests
POD1000000014_S0000217	what advice would you give to young colleagues newly arriving as caseworkers in the embryonic ombudsman profession
POD1000000014_S0000218	for me there is there is a couple of characteristics that have to be embodied by people working in the service or as an ombudsman
POD1000000014_S0000219	we have to be objective we have to be fair
POD1000000014_S0000220	we have to be even handed so the 1st advice often is make sure you know the whole story before you reach your conclusion
POD1000000014_S0000221	but underpinning all of that i would say that if you have not got a passionate commitment to justice then you are in the wrong job
POD1000000014_S0000222	because what this fundamentally is about is people who believe in fairness people who believe in justice and people who want to use their own efforts to make sure that nobody is denied access to justice
POD1000000014_S0000223	and that is what we are here for
POD1000000014_S0000224	thank you so much peter
POD1000000014_S0000225	your answers were stimulating and also inspirational
POD1000000014_S0000227	we are all very grateful for the time you have given for this interview
POD1000000014_S0000228	thanks a lot
POD1000000014_S0000230	my next guest will be the catalonian ombudsman rafael ribo
POD1000000014_S0000231	so he will be joining us from barcelona
POD1000000014_S0000232	in the meantime it is rob behrens on behalf of radio ombudsman saying have a good day and stay safe
POD1000000017_S0000001	from the new york times magazine i am nikole hannah jones this is 1619
POD1000000017_S0000003	this week wesley morris on the birth of american music
POD1000000017_S0000005	so last fall i am at my friend is house we are making dinner i am chopping vegetables and i asked my friend brett who was cooking with me can you put on some music
POD1000000017_S0000006	and he said what do you want to listen to and i said have you ever heard of yacht rock and he said what i said yacht rock have you ever heard of this and he goes no i have not
POD1000000017_S0000007	so he finds the yacht rock station in pandora which i do not know why or how he is still a pandora guy with all due respect to pandora he is one and he finds the yacht rock station
POD1000000017_S0000009	at some point brett has to go run an errand i think i might have sent him on one i do not remember but he has gone so i am alone just me with the vegetables and the yacht rock
POD1000000017_S0000011	it gives me plenty of time to really think about the songs i am hearing
POD1000000017_S0000013	we are talking about music made between the years of i do not know i would say like 1975 to about 1983 things like
POD1000000017_S0000015	aces how long
POD1000000017_S0000017	seals and crofts to doing summer breeze i am hearing things like
POD1000000017_S0000019	steal away by robbie dupree
POD1000000017_S0000021	and the doobie brothers what a fool believes
POD1000000017_S0000023	it is like our soft rock est period in american popular music
POD1000000017_S0000025	the joke of yacht rock is that whoever invented it whoever is making a playlist out of these songs is basically saying that they are inconsequential and that what is in them does not matter
POD1000000017_S0000027	but what i know i am hearing is something bigger and deeper than that
POD1000000017_S0000029	every song has something about it that is similar to the other songs
POD1000000017_S0000031	i am hearing things like rosanna by toto
POD1000000017_S0000033	which seems perfectly banal has a really good beat sort of builds to its chorus
POD1000000017_S0000035	but then at the end
POD1000000017_S0000037	i am hearing
POD1000000017_S0000039	the great doo wop harmonies of the 50s and 60s
POD1000000017_S0000041	there is something jazz like in the syncopated music of something like steely dan
POD1000000017_S0000043	you can hear in somebody like michael mcdonald
POD1000000017_S0000045	that is like a gospel breakdown
POD1000000017_S0000047	what i am hearing in all of these songs is basically blackness
POD1000000017_S0000049	and the song in which i am hearing it the deepest and strongest and most powerfully at least to me standing in that kitchen chopping those vegetables was when kenny loggins is this is it comes on
POD1000000017_S0000051	it has got a kind of loosely disco like rhythm to it there is a lot of percussion sort of going back and forth and around
POD1000000017_S0000053	sure kenny loggins is basically sing whispering the verses in this song
POD1000000017_S0000055	doing this very light
POD1000000017_S0000056	cool
POD1000000017_S0000058	and then in the pre chorus kenny loggins disappears and who shows up michael mcdonald
POD1000000017_S0000060	giving kenny loggins plenty of time to gather himself
POD1000000017_S0000062	when he sings the word miracle he does not sing miracle he goes miracle
POD1000000017_S0000064	like he is scraping the bottom of a pan to get all of the good bits off of it before you pour the gravy in
POD1000000017_S0000066	scraping the pan is the blackest thing you can do as a singer and here is kenny loggins as this white artist doing it
POD1000000017_S0000068	and then the gravy comes
POD1000000017_S0000070	he is like at the top of the church at this point
POD1000000017_S0000071	he has elevated himself to the rafters there is like no more he is like at the roof trying to clear a way to get to heaven but there is just church roof in the way
POD1000000017_S0000073	he is not the greatest singer but there is a kind of gumption and nerve to the singing of this song
POD1000000017_S0000075	that cannot be denied a tip of the hat to him
POD1000000017_S0000076	i just had to stand there and i just i i i actually cracked up i i just put down the knife and i cracked up and it felt so pleasurable and then i started thinking about all these other singers i love
POD1000000017_S0000078	i am thinking about amy winehouse
POD1000000017_S0000080	i am thinking about annie lennox
POD1000000017_S0000082	i am thinking about george michael
POD1000000017_S0000084	i think about chris stapleton
POD1000000017_S0000085	you practices this kind of muscly blues that gets written off as country because he is a big white guy in a hat
POD1000000017_S0000087	and one of the many phases in which david bowie really wanted to make r and b and soul music
POD1000000017_S0000089	this is the sound not just of black america but the sound of america it is deeply american almost especially when it is sung by british people like david bowie and annie lennox and amy winehouse
POD1000000017_S0000090	and it fills me with pride like i know that there is something irresistible and ultimately inevitable about black music being a part of american popular music
POD1000000017_S0000091	but it also reminds me that there is a history to this a very painful history and in the most perversely ironic way it is this historical pain that is responsible for this music
POD1000000017_S0000093	some of the oldest recordings we have of black american music are from the 1930s
POD1000000017_S0000094	and they are songs that would have been sung by americans born into slavery there is this one called old ship of zion
POD1000000017_S0000095	you can hear in it these 4 men their voices are moving in and out of each other
POD1000000017_S0000097	and it is beautiful and it is also sad you can feel that in your bones
POD1000000017_S0000098	and then there will be music that was completely the opposite like old coon dog for instance
POD1000000017_S0000100	you can hear the playfulness in the song
POD1000000017_S0000102	and you have got this banjo this great african instrument that becomes the bedrock of american music in so many ways and that thing is dancing
POD1000000017_S0000103	and then you have someone like billy mccrea
POD1000000017_S0000104	and 0 my god you can hear in his singing what we would now call something like the livelong day
POD1000000017_S0000106	years and years of hard work
POD1000000017_S0000107	and unimaginable sorrow
POD1000000017_S0000109	you can also hear in all of this music
POD1000000017_S0000111	this undeniable sound of hope
POD1000000017_S0000113	all of these melodies and cadences and emotions are things that would not be passed down generation after generation it is what you would have heard on a plantation it is what you would have heard walking by a plantation
POD1000000017_S0000114	it is what you would have heard passing a black person doing his job entertaining himself doing the drudgery of work the way a guy named thomas dartmouth rice did sometime around the 1830s
POD1000000017_S0000115	as the story goes t d rice a white man this anonymous nobody actor trying to make ends meet
POD1000000017_S0000116	one day he is touring with a troupe in cincinnati or maybe it was pittsburgh we do not really know but the myth basically goes t d rice happened upon an old black man cleaning a horse in a stable
POD1000000017_S0000117	the man was doing his job on property owned by a white man named crow
POD1000000017_S0000119	he heard the tune this old black man was singing he saw the way this man moved his body as he was cleaning this horse
POD1000000017_S0000120	now we do not know what tune this old man would have been singing
POD1000000017_S0000122	whatever rice hears coming out of this man is mouth is captivating to him and what he sees is an opportunity
POD1000000017_S0000124	because showbiz in the 1830s looked like this
POD1000000017_S0000126	italian operas
POD1000000017_S0000128	british plays entertainment imported from europe all the people performing this stuff would have been white the audiences would have been white
POD1000000017_S0000129	after all it is 1830 slavery is in full effect
POD1000000017_S0000131	and when it came to entertainment there was nothing new nothing truly american
POD1000000017_S0000133	and so when t d rice hears this black man singing this song and moving his body in this particular way ding a light bulb goes off
POD1000000017_S0000134	and he takes that light bulb and runs all the way to the theater he figures out a way to melt down some cork
POD1000000017_S0000135	let us it cool presumably takes a rag or maybe even his hand if it is cool enough
POD1000000017_S0000137	and then he paints his face black
POD1000000017_S0000139	he goes out on stage but instead of doing his regular act he has got this horse groomer is tune except now he is given the tune lyrics
POD1000000017_S0000140	come listen all you gals and boys i am just from tuckahoe i am going to sing a little song my name is jim crow
POD1000000017_S0000142	and the lyrics give the horse groomer a name and the name is jim crow
POD1000000017_S0000144	so the crowd goes crazy they go so bananas the man gets 20 encores
POD1000000017_S0000146	this is the 1st time a paying audience is basically electrified by a white man with a black face this is the night that jim crow was allegedly introduced to america this mascot of american racism
POD1000000017_S0000147	and this is what america really wanted which was its own original art form that is not an italian opera and is not some british guy coming over and thespianing all over them
POD1000000017_S0000148	and here is thomas dartmouth rice giving it to them this is the night that american popular culture was born
POD1000000017_S0000150	0 boy i mean you know how it goes this sensational thing happens and then everybody wants to get on the bandwagon and do their own
POD1000000017_S0000151	so you have other minstrel acts who come along and try to do what thomas dartmouth rice is doing a song and a dance
POD1000000017_S0000152	and a black face on their white skin
POD1000000017_S0000154	and then from these solo acts you have basically bands forming
POD1000000017_S0000156	and the bands have all the instruments that you would have in a band that you would recognize now there is a banjo and a fiddle and some tambourines and percussion in the form of bones which would come from a pig sometimes
POD1000000017_S0000157	that is the formation of what will become the minstrel troupe
POD1000000017_S0000159	and the place that minstrelsy took hold was in the north
POD1000000017_S0000160	places like philadelphia and new york and boston where you would have these theaters dedicated to minstrel acts where minstrel acts would just move into a theater and do their act night after night after night after night after night
POD1000000017_S0000161	and a lot of these performers had never been meaningfully south to have a meaningful relationship with black people and so they just made stuff up based on what they thought black people were like
POD1000000017_S0000163	they were able to draw on things that were coming to america from other parts of europe like the polka
POD1000000017_S0000165	and so you would had over the course of the formation of this culture an inherent mixing you had some amazing mix of an imagined blackness
POD1000000017_S0000166	real actual irish melodies and polish music with what we would now call gospel but spiritual harmonies interlaced together with this african banjo
POD1000000017_S0000168	basically welding into a fusion that becomes the thing that everybody wants to try to do
POD1000000017_S0000170	the whole thing just sweeps the nation and for the rest of the 19th century this is the shit can we say that
POD1000000017_S0000172	and so for the rest of the 19th century this is the shit
POD1000000017_S0000174	this is america is primary form of entertainment people are going crazy for blackface minstrels you have little boys going to bed and dreaming about how they can become part of this minstrel show
POD1000000017_S0000175	some of those people having these dreams go on to become people like stephen foster
POD1000000017_S0000177	stephen foster the man widely credited as being the father of american music
POD1000000017_S0000179	some of his songs some of his most famous songs songs you know songs you love songs you still sing songs your children if you have them they still sing some of those songs were written for blackface performers
POD1000000017_S0000181	and if you listen to something like camptown races you can hear in it all of its minstrel properties
POD1000000017_S0000183	the song of course is written in so called negro dialect i mean instead of saying going you are saying gwine
POD1000000017_S0000185	like instead of saying 0 f for of you get a lot of d e for de this is a white person imagining how a black person would sing this song
POD1000000017_S0000187	this is a white person imagining how a black person would sing this song
POD1000000017_S0000188	and that was a gold rush era hit
POD1000000017_S0000190	this is the i want to hold your hand of 1851
POD1000000017_S0000192	part of the problem that we still live with now is that it was so much the heart and soul of american culture that it was not that it became not racist
POD1000000017_S0000193	it just was a thing that you did if you wanted to be an entertainer at any point after 1830 you in all likelihood were at least going to try to be a blackface minstrel even if you were black
POD1000000017_S0000195	after the civil war ends and there is an opportunity for black people to perform they have to do what the nation wants and what the nation wants at that point is blackface
POD1000000017_S0000196	and now giving you noise in tempo
POD1000000017_S0000197	f e miller and scatman crothers
POD1000000017_S0000198	so black people blacked up and performed as black people who were not actually black
POD1000000017_S0000200	by the time you have black people painting their faces black to perform as black people the only question you can really ask at this point is what the hell is going on why is this happening
POD1000000017_S0000201	what was so captivating about seeing black people represented this way why would a white audience have clamored for it so much i think one of the things that it offered was an opportunity to feel good about a thing that actually felt really bad at the time
POD1000000017_S0000202	people were really torn about whether to continue with slavery or whether to abolish it the minstrel show did not really give you an answer
POD1000000017_S0000203	but it provided a platform by which you could either escape from actually having to think about that question that really was tearing the nation apart or depending on which show you would wind up seeing
POD1000000017_S0000204	it fully engaged you in the lightest possible way about enslaved people and how you did not really have to feel so bad for them because they like being enslaved you got to laugh at a thing that you actually felt so anguished about
POD1000000017_S0000205	you get to watch these black people who are really a source of national agony outside the theater become fools inside the theater and in sitting in that theater watching these white men in blackface make fools of black people
POD1000000017_S0000206	a white audience could feel cultured they could feel civilized they could feel superior to the people they were watching be made fun of
POD1000000017_S0000207	and in a crazy way watching them dehumanize would really have been an opportunity for a white audience to feel so much better about their own humanity
POD1000000017_S0000209	by the time you get to the 20th century minstrelsy is still with us it is the basis upon which american movies are built this country is 1st movie blockbuster
POD1000000017_S0000210	d w griffith is the birth of a nation full of white men villainously in blackface
POD1000000017_S0000212	and america is 1st talking motion picture
POD1000000017_S0000214	the jazz singer about a jewish man who feels most himself not as a jewish man struggling with his jewish identity and pleasing his cantor father no no
POD1000000017_S0000216	it is when he blacks his face up and performs mammy as a negro
POD1000000017_S0000218	some of american is favorite stars did numbers in blackface
POD1000000017_S0000220	judy garland performed in blackface
POD1000000017_S0000222	bing crosby and fred astaire both performed in blackface
POD1000000017_S0000224	white christmas has a whole number most famous number in white christmas involves a blackface tune
POD1000000017_S0000226	but at the same time there is the beginnings of a recording industry and you had black artists who had access to recording studios
POD1000000017_S0000227	out of these recordings you have people like muddy waters
POD1000000017_S0000229	inventing and perfecting blues rhythm blues ideas blues expression the expression of
POD1000000017_S0000231	of a fully human black self in american popular art
POD1000000017_S0000233	he had a kind of confidence that most people would never have heard coming from a black person before
POD1000000017_S0000235	and this is just the beginning
POD1000000017_S0000237	you have the advent of a place like blue note records where lots of amazing jazz was created and then released into the world people like sidney bechet
POD1000000017_S0000239	and then louis armstrong
POD1000000017_S0000241	and duke ellington
POD1000000017_S0000243	you have black musicians thinking about how to move not only music forward but american culture forward
POD1000000017_S0000245	thinking about how these instruments can do other things besides make what we think of as western european classical music
POD1000000017_S0000247	and taking music to a place that nobody had ever tried to previously take it
POD1000000017_S0000249	people who just kept pushing it forward and beyond
POD1000000017_S0000251	and then you have the development of the single most important movement black people have ever had artistically
POD1000000017_S0000253	and that is the advent of motown records
POD1000000017_S0000255	motown is the most powerful mass produced expression of black glamour of black self confidence of black self reliance
POD1000000017_S0000257	its project was to get black producers black musicians black singers to take quote white quote western musical ideas of orchestration strings and horns
POD1000000017_S0000259	and straightforward harmonies
POD1000000017_S0000261	and you marry them to a black weekend
POD1000000017_S0000263	where on saturday night you are at a juke joint having a good time with rhythm and blues music guitar and drum and bass
POD1000000017_S0000265	sex basically
POD1000000017_S0000267	and then you go home slightly hung over
POD1000000017_S0000269	and you wake up and you go to church on sunday morning
POD1000000017_S0000271	where there is a whole other musical experience involving hand claps and different harmonic arrangements and call and response
POD1000000017_S0000273	a lot of feeling a lot of oomph a lot of gratitude
POD1000000017_S0000275	you have the combination of these 3 different areas of musical expression happening at the same time in just about every single motown record
POD1000000017_S0000277	or whether it is the 4 tops doing reach out i will be there
POD1000000017_S0000279	or martha and the vandellas doing heat wave
POD1000000017_S0000281	on something like heat wave you can hear hands slapping the tambourine like it actually is sunday morning
POD1000000017_S0000283	then when everything is firing
POD1000000017_S0000285	it is just the most exciting romantic sound you are you are ever going to hear and at the center of it is what can only be described as a refulgent tasteful blackness
POD1000000017_S0000287	here you have in motown a force that is actively combating these ideas of black people as being inherently inferior
POD1000000017_S0000289	motown is the antidote to american minstrelsy
POD1000000017_S0000291	and this is what i was thinking about standing there in that kitchen chopping those vegetables it is the thing that made me laugh was just how all that history
POD1000000017_S0000292	is just very silently coursing through this music it might not even be aware that it is even there it is so thoroughly atomized into american culture it is going to show up in a way that even people making the art can not quite put their finger on
POD1000000017_S0000294	what you are hearing in black music that is so appealing to so many people of all races across time is possibility struggle it is strife it is humor
POD1000000017_S0000295	it is sex it is confidence and that is ironic because this is the sound of a people who for decades and centuries have been denied freedom
POD1000000017_S0000296	and yet what you respond to in black music is the ultimate expression of a belief in that freedom the belief that the struggle is worth it that the pain begets joy
POD1000000017_S0000297	and that that joy you are experiencing is not only contagious it is necessary and urgent and irresistible black music is american music
POD1000000017_S0000298	because as americans we say we believe in freedom and that is what we tell the world and the power of black music is that it is the ultimate expression of that belief in the american freedom
POD1000000018_S0000000	when andy griffith passed away in 2012 c n n covered his death off and on the entire day
POD1000000018_S0000001	you have all seen this type of news coverage before an overview of the career images of the star in their prime phone in conversations with other celebrities who were close with the departed
POD1000000018_S0000003	larry king is one of the people who called in to talk that day he would had andy on his various shows numerous times and he mentioned something in passing that is really interesting
POD1000000018_S0000005	what larry said is that a lawyer named percy foreman was the man who inspired the character matlock
POD1000000018_S0000007	this was a weird thing for anyone to say because most people even today believe that character to be based on a different lawyer named bobby lee cook
POD1000000018_S0000009	however in 20153 years after larry king said something that most people would assume was incorrect the creator of matlock did confirm that the character was based on percy foreman
POD1000000018_S0000010	a criminal defense attorney from houston texas who lost only 53 of the 1500 cases where clients of his faced the death penalty with only one of those losses resulting in an actual execution
POD1000000018_S0000012	percy was able to achieve this record by being an incredible lawyer no denying it but also due to the texas court system is practice of using juries to determine guilt as well as sentencing in the case of a guilty verdict
POD1000000018_S0000014	so instead of one judge who is heard it all before determining his client is fate
POD1000000018_S0000016	percy had 12 average citizens from the local community sitting right there waiting to be convinced that the victim in this situation was not a victim at all
POD1000000018_S0000017	they were up to no good the community was far better off without that element in it and even if his client had killed them well hell they hated killing
POD1000000018_S0000019	foreman called it misdemeanor murder that is where a jury might convict you of ending another person is life and send you on your way with the type of punishment you would receive for a misdemeanor crime
POD1000000018_S0000020	often nothing more than probation no time at all it is essentially a sanctioned form of vigilante justice
POD1000000018_S0000021	percy foreman had such a long run of wins with this strategy that it is still being used in texas today people who have conversations about this sort of thing will sometimes refer to it as the texas defense
POD1000000018_S0000023	now jim denny was not from texas he was from tennessee
POD1000000018_S0000024	the buffalo valley area about 60 miles east of nashville was a real poor area to be born in 1911
POD1000000018_S0000025	when a 16 year old jim denny got hired to work the mailroom of w s m radio is parent company he must have seen it as an opportunity to make something out of himself
POD1000000018_S0000027	denny got this job in 1927 that year the young radio program w s m barn dance was referred to as the grand ole opry for the 1st time on air
POD1000000018_S0000029	every time an odd job came up at the opry jim would take it so he could hang out backstage see the artists and see how the show was made
POD1000000018_S0000030	within 20 years denny had worked his way up to director of the artists service bureau at w s m which meant he was in charge of booking the acts on the opry
POD1000000018_S0000032	there is a few funny things from jim denny is time at the grand ole opry like the one about elvis presley is big debut
POD1000000018_S0000033	elvis was still a teenager when denny did sam phillips the favor of letting elvis come on the show to play his not country arrangement of blue moon of kentucky
POD1000000018_S0000035	it did not go well denny is rumored who have told elvis backstage you aint going nowhere son you ought to go back to driving a truck
POD1000000018_S0000037	denny is also the guy who fired hank williams over the telephone and there is the time when jim made johnny cash wait outside his office for 2 hours before letting him in to ask why cash should be allowed to play on the opry
POD1000000018_S0000039	cash mentioned that he presently had a song called i walk the line in the top 10
POD1000000018_S0000041	jim denny was what many people referred to in those times as a hard man today i think they would have some different words for him and that is why ernest tubb tried to shoot him in 1957
POD1000000018_S0000043	you are listening to cocaine and rhinestone the podcast about 20 century country music and the lives of those who give it to us
POD1000000018_S0000044	my name is tyler mahan coy i heard the stories my whole life
POD1000000018_S0000045	as far as i can tell here is the truth about this one
POD1000000018_S0000047	it is shocking to hear ernest tubb is name associated with any kind of violence whatsoever
POD1000000018_S0000049	there are plenty of stories about him but most of them are about how great a guy he was he had an adorable nickname e t you can hear admiration in the voice of everyone who calls him that
POD1000000018_S0000051	crisp texas is a ghost town now ernest tubb was born there in 1914 into a family of sharecroppers like most sharecroppers children ernest grew up working on farms all over the area
POD1000000018_S0000052	long days in the field entertainment from a stereo in the evenings an early bedtime and you get back up the next day to do it all over again typical day for a sharecropper
POD1000000018_S0000054	like a great number of artists we will learn about in future episodes it was all over for a 14 year old ernest tubb the 1st time he heard jimmie rodgers sing
POD1000000018_S0000056	the obsession with instant and it would steer the course of the rest of his life
POD1000000018_S0000058	hearing jimmie rodgers is what led ernest tubb to decide he simply had to become a country singer
POD1000000018_S0000059	it is also very specifically what caused him 3 decades later to want to shoot a 357 magnum at jim denny
POD1000000018_S0000061	in 1933 jimmie rodgers died young of tuberculosis symptoms he was 35
POD1000000018_S0000062	the death of his idol was extremely upsetting for ernest however it also made him realize that he was going to have to get serious about chasing his dreams
POD1000000018_S0000063	he moved to san antonio made a few guest appearances on a friend is radio show and managed to secure his own early morning show which aired twice a week not bad for a 19 year old kid
POD1000000018_S0000064	but do not get the wrong idea he was nowhere near the big time and the pay was quite slim
POD1000000018_S0000066	e t had to keep 2 other jobs besides the radio gig some days he was a ditch digger in other days a drug store clerk
POD1000000018_S0000067	holding down 3 jobs at once was necessary to support himself and his young wife elaine they did not waste any time before starting to have kids either
POD1000000018_S0000069	ernest was more than happy to work hard if it kept him moving toward the life of his hero jimmie rodgers
POD1000000018_S0000070	he would had this small picture of jimmie for years now and it was in pretty bad shape so he got a phone book and looked up the number for jimmie rodger is widow carrie
POD1000000018_S0000071	he called her on the phone to explain that he was such a big fan and to see if she happened to have a bigger better photo of jimmie that ernest could have maybe even one that was autographed
POD1000000018_S0000072	carrie was super nice and she did have such a photo that ernest could have and went so far as to invite him out to her house in kerrville texas to get the picture
POD1000000018_S0000073	ernest drove out there the next sunday he was not working taking elaine and their baby justin on the trip
POD1000000018_S0000075	they would planned to stay for maybe 10 minutes and ended up hanging out for over 2 hours looking at costumes guitars and pictures brought out by missus rodgers hearing her stories about how high on the hog they would lived merely a few years earlier
POD1000000018_S0000076	e t could never have guessed when he woke up that morning that he would be laying down to sleep that night having held jimmie rodgers signature martin acoustic guitar with jimmie is name inlaid in pearl across the fretboard and the word thanks written on the back upside down
POD1000000018_S0000077	so he could flip it over to show audiences
POD1000000018_S0000079	choose your biggest dead hero and try to think of how you would feel if a similar experience happened to you it is mind blowing
POD1000000018_S0000080	okay now add this on top of that a few months later carrie rodgers called ernest to say she would listened for his radio show as he would asked for her to do
POD1000000018_S0000081	on one hand she offered to help e t out with the access she still had to music business big shots
POD1000000018_S0000082	on the other hand she did not think he sounded like jimmie rodgers when he sang which is basically the only thing in the world ernest tubb wanted to do in this phase of his life
POD1000000018_S0000083	and everyone around him had told him that is exactly what he had been doing the whole time
POD1000000018_S0000085	anyway she still hooked e t up with elsie mcwilliams the writer of a few great jimmie rodgers songs
POD1000000018_S0000086	ernest tubb made a couple of records that did not sell very well did some touring and ended up back home doing low paying radio again and working 2 or 3 side jobs like before driving around a beer truck was one of them
POD1000000018_S0000088	after a while back at home ernest had to have his tonsils taken out he would later say the doctors told him not to sing or yodel for a while after the surgery but he did not listen
POD1000000018_S0000089	jumping right back into his normal routine re injured his throat
POD1000000018_S0000091	it changed his voice forever
POD1000000018_S0000093	ernest held a self deprecating sense of humor about his own voice for the rest of his life he loved to say that 9 out of 10 guys sitting in bars around the country could sing better than he could
POD1000000018_S0000094	i do not know if he really believed that it is always been strange to me i think george jones indisputably the greatest country singer in history is exactly what happens when you add ernest tubb is new singing style and roy acuff is voice together
POD1000000018_S0000096	you just heard some ernest here is a little roy acuff from 1942
POD1000000018_S0000098	now george junde would have told you hank williams was his favorite singer you do not get hank without ernest and roy i have seen lefty frizzell named as an influence on george
POD1000000018_S0000099	lefty borrowed from ernest as well however you want to say we got to george jones it always comes back to roy acuff and ernest tubb
POD1000000018_S0000100	now the part of ernest you can hear in george is the tendency to hold on to a note for longer than you would expect picking the melody up and putting it back down in ways that are impossible to predict when hearing them sing a song for the 1st time
POD1000000018_S0000101	no matter if it is a song you have heard performed by other people
POD1000000018_S0000102	here is georgia in 1956 doing his own composition just one more
POD1000000018_S0000104	both versions of this song are great
POD1000000018_S0000106	it is possible ernest really did not like his new voice about a 1000000 people disagree with his opinion he had that tonsillectomy in 1939
POD1000000018_S0000107	in 1940 he had his biggest hit walking the floor over you this song is still synonymous with the name ernest tubb
POD1000000018_S0000108	if someone only knows one ernest tubb song it is usually this song
POD1000000018_S0000109	we like introduce a man who has become a legend in his own time
POD1000000018_S0000110	e t was finally big time
POD1000000018_S0000111	the texas troubadour ernest tubb
POD1000000018_S0000114	he joined the grand ole opry in 1943 and formed the 1st incarnation of the texas troubadours
POD1000000018_S0000115	tubb would stay working for the rest of his life so members of the texas troubadours would be replaced every now and then
POD1000000018_S0000116	buddy emmons jack greene billy byrd leon rhodes and cal smith are only some of the notable players who joined the band on their way up the ladder
POD1000000018_S0000118	this was the 1st way ernest found to extend a helping hand to younger musicians like the hand carrie rodgers had held out to him
POD1000000018_S0000119	your dad made all those guys household name
POD1000000018_S0000120	yes he did
POD1000000018_S0000121	just intubb
POD1000000018_S0000122	he was the 1st one to call names out on records and he loved doing that he loved the guys and they were a big part of his show i mean and he wanted to make sure they got the credit for it
POD1000000018_S0000123	and so he started calling their names out when they get took a course but he was never jealous of anybody in his band outshining him you did you know he did not mind that at all as he proved with jack greene and cal smith and
POD1000000018_S0000124	and because he had the wilburns with him for a while and skeeter worked some dates with him george jones stonewall jackson and he was always pushing them and he like roy i think understood that the bigger they became the bigger he became
POD1000000018_S0000125	george jones and stonewall jackson were never texas troubadours justin meant e t took those guys out on tour with him as opening acts to help them build their own following and often he did a lot more than that
POD1000000018_S0000126	yeah i i do not have many but but i have one ernest
POD1000000018_S0000127	johnny paid check
POD1000000018_S0000129	ernest one time i was hanging around the streets and it was snowing and buddy emmons took me on to meet him he always wants me to meet him
POD1000000018_S0000130	and i had met him but i mean i wanted to sit and talk with him maybe get ready to go on tour and i did not have anywhere to stay you know i was at that stage in my life
POD1000000018_S0000131	and evidently buddy had told him that
POD1000000018_S0000132	the carver said we got on and he said i talked for a while and i was you know and he said well it is about time to leave he said yeah
POD1000000018_S0000133	he said you working as we follows to work and i said no he said you are now he was going on like 10 days out in texas and it was snowing here in nashville and i had nowhere to you know i just i was in my in in that place where i always you know
POD1000000018_S0000134	he took me on the road wound up giving me a suit i did not have nothing to wear so he gave me one of his old suits and took it to the cleaners and i had it cut down the 1st date we got in texas
POD1000000018_S0000135	and it was so there was 2 pockets in the back that is how much they had to take up but i it was a and and i still got a picture of me in in in in that suit
POD1000000018_S0000136	and i i he let me go out and i opened his show for him for 10 days and he fed me and at the end of the tour gave me some money so that is the kinda guy he was
POD1000000018_S0000138	you can not tell the hank snow story without talking about ernest tubb e t told johnny cash not to smile when he performed folsom prison blues so people in the audience could really feel the song
POD1000000018_S0000139	cash never forgot the advice hank williams senior was heavily influenced by ernest is music and ernest is the one who convinced the grand ole opry to bring hank back after his 1st failed audition
POD1000000018_S0000140	e t got hank to promise he would not touch any booze for 3 months to swing that one
POD1000000018_S0000141	in 1947 enough radio listeners wrote letters complaining of not being able to find his music that he launched the ernest tubb record shop in nashville if you could not make it there in person they would ship records directly to you
POD1000000018_S0000142	it was a game changer for country music fans and would help keep the music alive when rock and roll steamrolled america in the 50s
POD1000000018_S0000144	the record shop operated at a loss of $10000 a year for the 1st 2 years it was open but ernest knew how important it was and he kept it alive
POD1000000018_S0000145	the opry was a great promotional tool for him and he would started his own show on w s m in the following time slot when the opry was over fans could stay tuned in for the midnite jamboree
POD1000000018_S0000147	ernest played host to opry stars and newcomers alike making sure to remind you this music was available for mail order from ernest tubb is record shop he took the chance to keep jimmie rodgers memory alive pitching his records as well
POD1000000018_S0000149	ernest never grew out of his fascination with jimmie rodgers and never stopped repaying his debt to jimmie is widow carrie jimmie is death had left carrie in a pretty bad financial situation but she still got money from the sales of his records which were declining
POD1000000018_S0000150	he realized the more jimmie rodgers records sold the better off carrie would be so e t pushed those records as hard as he could
POD1000000018_S0000151	carrie loaned and eventually flat out gave him that guitar of jimmie is which is why you will frequently see pictures or videos of ernest tubb playing a guitar that says jimmie rodgers on it
POD1000000018_S0000152	in 1953 ernest helped found the jimmie rodgers memorial festival in rodgers hometown of meridian mississippi that is a stand up guy
POD1000000018_S0000154	you can find plenty of people who will say the same thing about jim denny
POD1000000018_S0000155	remember jim poor kid from tennessee worked his way up from the mailroom to become director of artists services at w s m and manager of the grand ole opry
POD1000000018_S0000156	director of artists services was a fancy way of saying he booked the musical acts that played on the radio station as well as the opry
POD1000000018_S0000157	denny was a powerful man in nashville and he acted like he knew it
POD1000000018_S0000158	where ernest tubb built a reputation for helping young musicians jim denny had a reputation for acting like a dick
POD1000000018_S0000160	the johnny cash e t gave advice to is the same johnny cash who had to wait 2 hours outside denny is office
POD1000000018_S0000162	jim denny might not have been a dick he could have simply been a businessman who paid more attention to the bottom line than how many friends he had
POD1000000018_S0000163	denny is the guy who had to be convinced to let hank senior onto the opry and he is the guy who called hank to fire him over the telephone but ernest tubb was standing in denny is office when that phone call was made
POD1000000018_S0000164	he said he saw tears in jim is eyes
POD1000000018_S0000165	hank had missed a scheduled opry appearance most likely for no good reason other than that he was drunk denny said he thought firing hank would make him realize he needed to get his act together
POD1000000018_S0000166	that is not what happened hank williams died 4 months after being dismissed from the opry it is tragic but you can see how jim denny thought he was doing the right thing in that situation
POD1000000018_S0000167	this is important to recognize because the year hank williams died is the same year that jim denny formed cedarwood publishing with webb pierce
POD1000000018_S0000169	if you do not know what a publishing company is it used to be the heart of the record industry on the surface a publishing company is purpose was to make sure sales royalties were going to the right place
POD1000000018_S0000170	they took a big percentage to do this so anything that could be done to make a hit out of one of their writer is songs they would do it and if they forgot to send you your whole royalty check sometimes well shit happens
POD1000000018_S0000172	roy acuff and fred rose had started acuff rose music back in 1942
POD1000000018_S0000173	so many country writers were being screwed over by publishing companies based out of other cities that they needed to be one in nashville an honest publishing company run by country artists for country artists
POD1000000018_S0000174	they were the best game in town until jim denny formed cedarwood in 53
POD1000000018_S0000175	as head of artists services at w s m and manager of the grand ole opry jim denny controlled who got to play on the opry their place in the lineup and how long they got to play
POD1000000018_S0000176	can you see where this is headed
POD1000000018_S0000178	if jim denny owns a country music publishing firm while retaining singular control of the most popular country music radio program in america then he is essentially printing his own money
POD1000000018_S0000180	once he has got a writer signed to cedarwood then he is getting a huge piece of any money their songs make if that writer also wants to be a performer congratulations you are on the opry tonight
POD1000000018_S0000181	if the writer does not want to be a performer congratulations webb pierce is the biggest star on the opry and he is playing your song on the grand ole opry tonight
POD1000000018_S0000182	roy acuff was pissed off and he did not stay quiet about it he said denny was giving the best bounce to his own artist artists signed to acuff rose had a tendency to see roy is point
POD1000000018_S0000183	artists signed to cedarwood had a tendency to think jim denny was not doing anything wrong weird
POD1000000018_S0000184	long story short in 1956 w s m fired jim denny over his conflicts of interest
POD1000000018_S0000186	he started a booking agency and signed most of the opry artists some of whom had resigned when denny was fired then denny contacted the philip morris tobacco company
POD1000000018_S0000187	their competition in the cigarette business r j reynolds was a sponsor of the grand ole opry
POD1000000018_S0000188	so when jim denny called with a chance for them to get their product associated with all those acts philip morris wrote a check big enough to fund the biggest country music package tour anyone had ever seen
POD1000000018_S0000189	half the grandal opry lineup these fans listened to every saturday night was coming to stages across america for live appearances
POD1000000018_S0000190	with philip morris paying for everything the admission was even free
POD1000000018_S0000191	it looked as though everyone was getting what they wanted until the philip morris country music show booked a stop in meridian mississippi on the same week as the 5th annual jimmie rodgers memorial festival
POD1000000018_S0000192	but it was worse the philip morris show would take place on the 2nd night of the 2 day jimmie rodgers festival
POD1000000018_S0000194	for 5 years ernest tubb had worked to grow the jimmie rodgers festival from scratch this is a tremendously difficult thing to do e t put in the effort to honor his idol
POD1000000018_S0000196	jim denny was not simply setting up shop across the street with some healthy competition
POD1000000018_S0000197	he brought a free show to town on the same night with half the grand ole opry lineup and several big names you would have had to buy a ticket to see on the jimmie rodgers event the previous night
POD1000000018_S0000198	it is hard not to see that as a giant middle finger can you imagine what would happen if coachella set up a festival 8 miles away from bonnaroo on the same weekend for free
POD1000000018_S0000199	it would crush bonnaroo this was such a big deal that they did not even have the jimmie rodgers memorial festival the following year
POD1000000018_S0000200	they regrouped to put one on again in 1959 but carrie rodgers health had already taken a turn for the worse and ernest tubb was never involved with the festival again
POD1000000018_S0000202	mostly a kind man e t was different when he had been drinking a beer or 2 while gambling with the guys he would be fine but it was the times when he would get drinking for a whole day or 2 or 5
POD1000000018_S0000203	mirrors would get smashed windows broken he had a thing about glass apparently
POD1000000018_S0000205	according to billy byrd ernest tubb is reaction to the philip morris country music show undercutting the jimmie rodgers memorial festival was to get drunk and stay drunk for the better part of a week
POD1000000018_S0000206	they carted him back to nashville but he was still drinking and he was still mad as hell at jim denny
POD1000000018_S0000207	finally he called denny at home in the middle of the night to cuss him out denny said something like well if you are so mad about it then how about you just meet me down at w s m right now and we will settle things for good
POD1000000018_S0000209	that sounded like a great plan to ernest tubb he strapped on a gun belt with bullets and 357 magnum in the holster and drove downtown in his cadillac wearing house slippers
POD1000000018_S0000210	meanwhile when jim denny had hung up the phone he simply took it back off the hook again so ernest could not call him anymore and then went back to sleep
POD1000000018_S0000212	so ernest tubb is drunk off his ass with a loaded gun when he stumbles into the lobby of the national life building where w s m was located
POD1000000018_S0000213	it is close to 530 in the morning people are starting to show up for work
POD1000000018_S0000215	there is more than one version of what happened next the gun gets fired in all of them
POD1000000018_S0000217	bill williams the news director at w s m says he was walking in to work when a gunshot rang out in the lobby and a bullet went over his head into the wall
POD1000000018_S0000218	he turned around you know pretty scared and saw ernest tubb standing there in his house slippers with a revolver
POD1000000018_S0000220	when he asked ernest what the hell he was doing ernest said my god i have shot the wrong man
POD1000000018_S0000221	whether or not he had been actively trying to kill anyone we will never know for certain it seems to me like he thought he had successfully shot someone and was only upset that someone was not jim denny
POD1000000018_S0000222	either way ernest settled down after thinking he would shot an innocent person bill williams called his boss jack dewitt to tell him what happened jack told bill to take ernest home
POD1000000018_S0000223	he would have except the police had been called as soon as other employees heard a gunshot in the office building
POD1000000018_S0000225	ernest tubb went to jail for drunk and disorderly plus carrying the weapon
POD1000000018_S0000226	it was mandatory to hold public intoxication arrestees for 3 hours
POD1000000018_S0000227	so ernest bought cigarettes for all the other inmates and sang songs with them while bill williams waited to take him home
POD1000000018_S0000229	$60 bond got him out and that was the end of that
POD1000000018_S0000231	jim denny is name was kept out of the papers though everyone in the business could read between the lines and see who ernest had wanted to shoot
POD1000000018_S0000233	the incident seems to have had no effect on ernest is career whatsoever apparently if all e t was trying to do was put a bullet in jim denny then that was fine
POD1000000018_S0000235	his career lasted into the 1980s he was still doing over 200 dates on the road a year and he only quit in 1982 because of problems from his emphysema
POD1000000018_S0000236	in 1984 his lungs killed him just like his hero jimmie rodgers
POD1000000018_S0000238	the midnite jamboree still airs every saturday night and you can still buy music from ernest tubb is record shop or online at e t record shop dot com
POD1000000018_S0000240	we are told that in 1963 ernest tubb made up with jim denny before jim passed away from cancer the jim denny artist bureau stayed in business for only a few more years
POD1000000018_S0000242	jim denny was inducted to the country music hall of fame in 1966 cedarwood jim denny is publishing company was sold to mel tillis in 1983
POD1000000018_S0000243	ernest tubb had been inducted to the country music hall of fame in 1965 while he was still alive

POD1000000018_S0000251	if enough people send in questions then i will make a q and a episode to close out the 1st season alright liner notes
POD1000000018_S0000252	okay 1st of all if i did not make it clear it is impossible to overstate ernest tubb importance to country music
POD1000000018_S0000253	aside from influencing basically everyone who matters he was one of the 1st if not in fact the 1st artist to bring an electric guitar player with him on to the grand ole opry stage
POD1000000018_S0000254	if you want to call it a honky tonk and it happened after ernest tubb it was influenced by ernest tubb before i get to the story and episode i would like to address one other thing
POD1000000018_S0000255	in the 1980s clyde moody try to start an alternative association to the country music hall of fame called the country music pioneer association
POD1000000018_S0000256	the c m p a had a trashy newspaper that clyde essentially used to rant against the industry and print whatever shitty rumors people sent in
POD1000000018_S0000257	among these rumors was one that ernest tubb died broke and alone in a cheap downtown motel shunned by the country music world he done so much to help
POD1000000018_S0000258	this rumor is still spread as fact and i do not believe it is true
POD1000000018_S0000259	charlie louvin even has it in his autobiography which is not the only thing charlie got wrong in that book but i will talk about that another time
POD1000000018_S0000260	1st of all the source was ernest tubb is estranged wife next ernest died owning 70% of the ernest tubb record shop which had multiple locations running and was very profitable at that time he was not a broke man
POD1000000018_S0000261	it is just that is not realistic
POD1000000018_S0000262	i believe ernest chose to turn visitors away because he was wasting away is emphysema and did not want anyone who loved him to have that as their last memory of him
POD1000000018_S0000263	i do not remember who it was but someone actually did get in to see him and they point blank said they wish they had not gone to see him
POD1000000018_S0000264	they could tell he was uncomfortable about it and they were uncomfortable about it and they do not like having that be their last memory of him so he was trying to avoid that
POD1000000018_S0000265	and i think justin said that people would go will try to see earnest and he would tell justin to tell them thank you but he would rather not have the company
POD1000000018_S0000266	so you know i mean the end i i do not think that ernest tubb died you know and it is sad state of affairs i think that he did
POD1000000018_S0000268	i think he did a lot for the country music and i think he went out of way that he wanted to go at it seems like to me okay back to ernest tubb and jim denny
POD1000000018_S0000269	what what about this story right is was that crazy it is just so many things like the the roots of country music are just growing all over this story you know you got jim denny showing up right as the grand ole opry is becoming a thing
POD1000000018_S0000270	ernest tubb gets in there and his throat is broken so he can not do what he wanted to do is whole life which is imitate his hero
POD1000000018_S0000271	and his throat gets broken and so now he has got a create this new thing and he ends up influencing fucking hank williams senior and like everyone that is that is crazy it is amazing i love the story
POD1000000018_S0000272	i i will not even try to pretend to remember the 1st time i heard this story it it gets around you know
POD1000000018_S0000273	at least the part about ernest tubb getting drunk and going down to the radio station with a gun and shooting them firing off around to the wall you know
POD1000000018_S0000274	if people always bring that up as an example of how wild and crazy these old guys were everybody laughs about ernest getting hauled off to jail and ultimately getting away with causing a little bit of trouble you know boys will be boys
POD1000000018_S0000275	and nobody ever seemed to know why it happened and that is all i ever really wanted to know people will tell you the story just like what why did he do that but i do not know who cares it is just funny like well i wanted to know so i found out

POD1000000018_S0000282	also i am aware there are you know different revisionist history type opinions about how well elvis presley is debut on the grand ole opry did or did not go
POD1000000018_S0000283	my thing is he did not get an encore you know that is a fact he did not get encore he was a special gust and special guests almost always get an encore so the fact that he did not get one

POD1000000018_S0000294	i know i am going to keep coming back to this book for future episodes a lot of when i got out of that for this was about denny is firing because pretty much everywhere else you hear people talk about denny getting fired
POD1000000018_S0000295	they are all like yeah i do not know it was just like weird no one really knows why he got fired or you got artists who were with cedar wood saying jim dandy got railroaded
POD1000000018_S0000296	you have got artists who were with a cuff rose and denny was corrupted and he had to get out of there you know so this w s m book was really good just to find out straight up what happened
POD1000000018_S0000298	i mentioned that hank senior was heavily influenced by ernest tubb but also some of the most charming stuff i ever read about hank is the way he acted around ernest
POD1000000018_S0000299	you know they were peers they were contemporaries it hank was influenced by him but then he you know got to come to the show
POD1000000018_S0000300	and be a part of the big time and you just get the idea that you were just like a kid in a candy store around ernest tubb you get the idea that you just really love being around this guy and you could not help messing with him he is always screwing with ernest

POD1000000018_S0000309	there is a book called andy and don with the confirmation of percy foreman inspiring matlock
POD1000000018_S0000310	percy is no longer alive and his new york times obituary had some other interesting information that i did not know
POD1000000018_S0000311	like jack ruby ask percy foreman to defend him after shooting lee harvey oswald but then there was this communication error like
POD1000000018_S0000312	jack ruby is people told jack that informant want it like 5 times as much money as he could ever ask for anyone or something so he was like well screw that i get someone else
POD1000000018_S0000313	and informant like seem disappointed that he did not get that case so i guess he wanted that but informant did represent martin luther king juniors assassin james earl ray
POD1000000018_S0000314	but only long enough to convince him to plead guilty so yeah james did not get away with that
POD1000000018_S0000316	0 yeah the texans defense thing i have spent a lot of time in texas and this defense thing is so effective there
POD1000000018_S0000317	that i went into this episode with the understanding that that was actually a lot like that is a statute on the books in texas
POD1000000018_S0000318	people who lived in texas their whole life believe they live in a state with a law called that he needed killing law and i know that because these people have told me that
POD1000000018_S0000319	and yeah i i always just thought it was a law in texas like you can straight up murder a mother fucker if they deserve it you know if they have got coming
POD1000000018_S0000320	you shoot them they are dead he needed kill in this is still the wild west do not mess with texas
POD1000000018_S0000321	it was only after uncovering the percy foreman matlock connection that i learned that it was really just a legal defense strategy that works so incredibly well there it may as well be a law
POD1000000018_S0000323	it is pretty intense
POD1000000018_S0000325	i think that is it 0 next week if you are listening to this early i am just putting us up on the website and if you happen to listen to it early
POD1000000018_S0000326	then next week i am going to be talking about loretta lynn song the pill it is about the birth control pill and it was banned from radio and i was looking into why and i found out a lot of really really interesting stuff you know thing
POD1000000018_S0000327	the kind of stuff the you know everyone no one could be really surprised by but when you hear the actual numbers on these stats
POD1000000018_S0000328	it is it is crazy it is really crazy definitely come back next week loretta lynn the pill
POD1000000018_S0000330	see you there
POD1000000022_S0000000	hello everyone i am stephen west this is philosophize this thank you to everyone that supports the show on patron and thank you to the people that do not support the show by going through the amazon banner you find out more about both those things on the front page of philosophize this dot org
POD1000000022_S0000001	apologies for the voice and my lack of execution today just getting over a cold i i but had been too long since i graced you with my voice and i want to give you guys this today is episode is part 6 in a series on sartre and camus i hope you love the show today
POD1000000022_S0000003	so in a culture where there is so much social currency connected to being a victim and i having some burden that you carry around with you throughout your life there maybe some you out there that feel a little left out while that maybe you are the kind of person you look at yourself you do not feel like a victim
POD1000000022_S0000004	maybe you do not sit around poised waiting to make other people aware of some bad thing that happened to you in the past well enough of that crazy talk get off the bench cause your uncle steve is putting you in the game i am here to tell you do not worry my friend you are a victim you really are
POD1000000022_S0000005	turns out we are all victims just by virtue of being born because just think for a 2nd about how horrible the world was for us when we were all babies think of what it is like being a baby
POD1000000022_S0000006	imagine going through something similar today and if you made it on the other side tell me you would not be part of some sort of advocacy group for the people that are currently going through it think about it you did not choose to be born imagine being rounded up against your will and being rocketed off to some alien planet you know nothing about
POD1000000022_S0000007	you find yourself once you get on that planet absorbed into some foreign tribe you do not speak the language you have no idea what anything is you you think the remote control to their t v is food you are completely defenseless and who do you have as teachers on this journey
POD1000000022_S0000008	what just some random man and woman that happen to look like you did not go to school for this stuff being a baby being a baby is like going to the world is worst community college or they do not even have teachers they just pull some random people off the street and say teach these kids about rocket science go
POD1000000022_S0000009	except it is worse than that we are not just learning about rocket science we are learning everything about what it is to exist how we look at other people how we look at the world how we look at ourselves within that world what i am saying is the struggle for us former babies out here was real
POD1000000022_S0000010	and i think it is safe to say that when you are living in the middle of this chaotic world as a baby just try to figure things out no one is really blaming you for just sort of going along with a lot of the ways people were doing things around you
POD1000000022_S0000011	there is a lot to figure out and a lot of these ways we have learned to make sense of stuff are totally arbitrary a lot of the ways we think about stuff have just been sort of almost by accident passed down from generation to generation philosophers realized this
POD1000000022_S0000012	and at the time of sartre for over 300 years people had been pointing out how many of the ways we look at things in the western world are largely derivative from the way christianity describes being a human being
POD1000000022_S0000013	that is how entrenched religion was in the lives of people back then and that even if you have never been to church even if your family is 15 generations removed from ever having stepped foot in a church some of these things are so foundational that generation after generation of confused baby try to figure things out
POD1000000022_S0000014	just went along with certain assumptions about existence that have their origins in christianity for example there is a certain revelatory way that a lot of people look at important crossroads in life right like for example they will say
POD1000000022_S0000015	okay so i need to choose a career path for my life i need to declare a major big decision what do i do well whenever i close my eyes and think about what i want i honestly do not know what i want i can not make that big of a decision yeah i have narrowed it down to a few things
POD1000000022_S0000016	but how can i ever know
POD1000000022_S0000018	i can spend hours a day thinking about this stuff i have faith it is going to come to me some day i have faith that i am going to wake up one day somethings going to happen to me some life event is going to occur
POD1000000022_S0000020	i am going to realize my calling in life in that moment people do this same thing with relationships they will say i have this vague idea up in my head of my one and only someone do not know exactly what they look like do not know exactly what they are going to be like but i am confident one day i am going to meet someone
POD1000000022_S0000021	and there is going to be this moment when i look at them and i realize they are the person i want to spend the rest of my life with people do this with anything they they will do it with motivational videos on youtube one day i am going to watch the right person screaming at me to be a better person
POD1000000022_S0000022	and from then on out it is going to be easy for me to go to the gym and eat pine cones for the rest of my life in other words there is a certain revelatory way that some people look at life choices that some thinkers believe is a long lost relic of the revelatory way we used to think about the nature of existence
POD1000000022_S0000023	that a reasonable expectation to have when navigating your life is that one day you are going to wake up and there is going to be some event some miracle that you witness some transcendent moment where you realize the divinity of jesus
POD1000000022_S0000024	if you have any further questions about the nature of existence just you know forward them to the pope is inbox that is a reasonable thing to expect in that worldview well this is not the only example of these long lost remnants of christianity in our thinking
POD1000000022_S0000025	and another major one another one that a lot of people in today is world still use to make sense of things is the way that they look at themselves and who they are just like in christianity where yes you have a body but your true self is a soul
POD1000000022_S0000026	it is an eternal spirit hidden deep down within that body that you have an intimate access to just like that a lot of people in today is world think of their true self or the answer to the question who are you as a personality hidden deep within us that only we and our closest friends have access to
POD1000000022_S0000027	you know they will say things like sure when i am out in public i do kind of put on a mask to other people for the sake of social utility i mean i do not act like my 100% true self in the starbucks drive thru
POD1000000022_S0000028	yeah i tell people things they want to hear i play the game because look the fact is it is just not useful too
POD1000000022_S0000029	not to mention i do not really feel comfortable giving a 100% of my true self to the person in the starbucks drive thru who am i really though well that is something i reserve for my family my closest friends in fact even some of my closest friends do not know everything about the depths of what it is to be me
POD1000000022_S0000030	maybe for some of you out there there is only one other person in this entire world that has full access to your true self hidden deep within you but sartre would say is this really how the self works
POD1000000022_S0000031	is the self really like the christian soul hidden somewhere deep within you that only you have access to sartre would say it very well may be that you put on a mask when you go out in public for the sake of pragmatism and it very well may be that you have reflected on yourself
POD1000000022_S0000032	and you have this idea up your head of who you are that is only accessed by you and your closest friends but do not ignore the possibility that there are multiple levels of deception going on there maybe you are telling yourself a story you want to hear the same way you are telling the starbucks barista a story
POD1000000022_S0000033	this concept is a common one in existentialism it is actually one of the main themes in dostoyevsky is book crime and punishment the idea that you know we often think we know a lot more about ourselves than we actually do in practice 2 examples of this
POD1000000022_S0000034	bear with me for a 2nd on the 1st one is a little cartoonish but i think it is a really good example to pull us out of this conditioned way we often look at the self and it get is us to honestly start asking this question where is this self that we are talking about really located
POD1000000022_S0000035	1st example imagine a guy that thinks he is napoleon you know he spends all day every day dressing up in parisian military garb he builds a buncker out of couch cushions in his front room agonizing to himself how am i going to conquer moscow
POD1000000022_S0000036	that guy now this man believes beyond a shadow of a doubt that he is napoleon if you set him down and then asked him candidly no but who are you really deep down inside he would say i am napoleon bonaparte commander of the armies of the north
POD1000000022_S0000037	husband to a murdered wife father to a murdered son and i will have my vengeance but is this man really napoleon we know he is not napoleon in fact in a weird way as outsiders we seem to have an advantage when it comes to knowing who he really is
POD1000000022_S0000038	interesting here is the less cartoonish example and try to think about how this applies to you imagine a guy sitting on the couch watching t v with his pals they turn on the news and there is a story about some mass shooting that happened at a walmart somewhere
POD1000000022_S0000039	he hears the story gets kind of angry turns to his friends and says you know what that guy and people like him they better hope they never shows up at my walmart someone pulls out a gun when i am there i am not going to be one of those people on the news chopper camera screaming and running out of the store
POD1000000022_S0000040	i am going to the sporting goods section i may i am going to go up into the rafters like i am tom cruise and snap the dude is neck i am going to do this because that is just the kind of person i am that is me i would sacrifice my life for the greater good now he may tell his friends this
POD1000000022_S0000041	he may believe that who he is deep down beyond a shadow of a doubt but if next saturday he is out shopping with his family someone pulls out a gun and all his wife and kids see is a a poof of smoke and he is running out the back door who is that guy really
POD1000000022_S0000042	in other words when we reference this thing we call our self intuitively it can feel like well i am my self i know who i am so no one can tell me who i am but me
POD1000000022_S0000043	in fact if you just recited that statement in most public settings people would be like yeah yeah you tell them only you know who you are deep down inside but is that a delusion is that just a narrative that we tell ourselves to simplify this concept of the self
POD1000000022_S0000044	sartre says that when you take a closer look at the self it is not a soul it is not a personality hidden deep within you what we are referencing when we talk about the self turns out to be much more complex than that with me more moving parts
POD1000000022_S0000045	and i think a good place to begin if we want to understand sartre is views on what the self really is is to talk about 2 foundational aspects of what it means to be a human being that to sartre seem to be constantly intertwined and dependent upon each other what he calls our facticity
POD1000000022_S0000046	and our transcendence if you are a human being that is alive right now you have both facticity and transcendence put very simply our facticity is the collection of facts that are true about us at any given moment
POD1000000022_S0000047	and transcendence is our ability to change or the possibilities that we have at our disposal let us break it down further though remember last time when we talked about being in itself versus being for itself being in itself as being kind of like matter this inert featureless blob of existence
POD1000000022_S0000048	fully affirmative and being for itself as being consciousness or the source of all negation well one day when sartre is trying to meet his monthly quota for obscure sounding philosophical descriptions the way he describes the relationship between these 2 ontological categories is that being in itself
POD1000000022_S0000049	quote is what it is and being for itself quote is what it is not well as weird as that sounds in a vacuum after listening to last episode we all know what he means when he says it but then sartre points out something very mysterious a very strange coincidence
POD1000000022_S0000050	when you look at the relationship between these 2 ontological categories 2 things that are easy to write off as just these meaningless abstract concepts that sartre cooked up one day when you look at how being in itself and being for itself relate to each other
POD1000000022_S0000051	sartre notices there seems to be a similar sort of relationship at the foundation of who we are as people see because on one hand all of us have our facticity and facticity is kind of like being in itself it is the fully affirmative set of facts that are true about us
POD1000000022_S0000052	you ask me who i am and oftentimes i will state the facts about myself 0 i am 117 years old that is a fact i am a horse wrangler by profession that is a fact i make $28000 a year i drive a ford focus
POD1000000022_S0000053	i i i am scared of spiders things like that right in other words statements of facts that are currently true about us that is what makes up our facticity but what sartre would want us to consider is that while these kinds of statements are no doubt useful when it comes to describing certain pieces of who i am
POD1000000022_S0000054	they never tell us the full story and the reason why is because human beings are far more complex than that to fully understand a human being just by default is to understand a type of being that has possibilities none of us are pure facticity in other words
POD1000000022_S0000055	the only time a human being is pure facticity is when they are dead yes we have a set of facts that are true about us right now but we always have the ability to change into something else and if we are trying to describe the self if we are trying to look at the whole picture of who someone is
POD1000000022_S0000056	the choices we make about which of these possibilities we are going to bring about end up being just as important as the facts about who we are right now for example if i am going to school to become an i t consultant or if i am training for a marathon or if i am losing a bunch of weight for wedding pictures
POD1000000022_S0000057	a big part of understanding who i am is understanding the thing i am actively trying to change into an i t consultant a marathon runner in other words part of understanding the full picture of me is understanding what i am not yet
POD1000000022_S0000058	you can start to hear the weird sartre description creeping in there just like being in itself is what it is and being for itself is what it is not in a sense i am what i am i have a facticity but i also am what i am not yet
POD1000000022_S0000059	when i consider my transcendence just like being in itself and being for itself these 2 aspects of what it is to be a human being facticity and transcendence are entangled intertwined and in some cases reliant on each other for their very existence
POD1000000022_S0000060	your facticity and transcendence are constantly affecting each other and that is because the facts of your life are often times caused by what possibilities you decide to bring about and the possibilities you have decided to explore are almost always limited by the facts of your life
POD1000000022_S0000061	let us stop with the hypotheticals and give a real example alright me i will use me as an example i am 6 feet tall a £172.2 this morning now no matter how much i want to
POD1000000022_S0000062	i am never going to become a horse jockey it is just not going to happen for me as long as there are people out there that are £44885 the facticity that i am a certain height and weight limits my ability to transcend and the result of that is
POD1000000022_S0000063	i am never winning the kentucky derby it is not happening this is an example of how our ability to transcend is often times limited by the facts about us another example i was born with a particular face and a particular ability to put on muscle
POD1000000022_S0000064	no matter how much i want to i am never going to be an instagram model the the facticity of my face my my facticity and and all the other stuff going on there
POD1000000022_S0000065	look i will never be the kind of person that people want to voluntarily look at and then click an emoji that signifies how they are feeling about the most recent picture of me it is not going to happen and these facts about me are the parameters i live my life and exercise my freedom within see because that is the thing and this goes for all of you out there
POD1000000022_S0000066	when sartre talks about radical freedom when any of us talk about being individuals that are free to act as they choose we are never talking about total freedom right it is always freedom within certain limitations
POD1000000022_S0000067	you know we often say things like i can do whatever i want to do but you can not really do anything you want to do right i mean ultimately you are a human being you can not wrap yourself in a protective cocoon and then emerge a unicorn in 3 days you can not fly to the edge of the universe and look at what is on the other side
POD1000000022_S0000068	no freedom is always freedom within certain limitations and it is those limitations that give a lot of what you choose to do in life it is value we see this in all the various different forms of art you know when someone writes a really good haiku
POD1000000022_S0000069	we see it as good not because they are the greatest words that could ever have been possibly strung together now the beauty of the haiku is because we understand that we have given an artist total freedom within a set of limitations that we impose
POD1000000022_S0000070	5 syllables 7 syllables 5 syllables go in other words the limitations are a big part of what makes the haiku beautiful and this applies to life as well
POD1000000022_S0000071	the facticity that you were born into your own individual limitations are always going to affect the possibilities that you have and what you ultimately choose to do with your life so try to live your life like it is a piece of art you are creating
POD1000000022_S0000072	but yeah ultimately the point sartre is making here with the concepts of facticity and transcendenceis it is not only to stop thinking about your self as though it is this artifact hidden deep within you inside of a vault but also stop thinking about who you are as though it is this static
POD1000000022_S0000073	unchanging thing that you can point to the point that is making is that who you are is always in a state of constant change sometimes small changes sometimes bigger changes but changing and in flux but do not go extreme in the other direction
POD1000000022_S0000074	do not start thinking of your self as this ethereal thing that can never be defined again all the way up until the day you die when you are finally turned into total facticity you will always have certain facts that are true about you and certain possibilities at your disposal to bring about
POD1000000022_S0000075	unless if you are dead you have never arrived at a destination as a human being now at 1st glance this may seem like sartre is writing a self help book no no single fact about you sums up who you are release your inner transcendence no
POD1000000022_S0000076	no like we touched on last time sartre thinks that when people are truly faced with the number of these possibilities are free to choose from most of the time they do not get excited they are horrified by it in fact most of the time once people realize this stuff
POD1000000022_S0000077	sartre thinks that the secret covert desire of everyone whether they realize it or not is to escape this duality it is to turn themselves into either pure facticity or pure transcendence or as sartre says we all secretly want to become god
POD1000000022_S0000078	let us talk about what he means by that think about the way followers of the abrahamic religions have traditionally looked at god what is it like to be god well god is perfect god is in this moment everything he will ever be if god had a job interview and the person asked him what is one thing you would change about yourself
POD1000000022_S0000079	god literally does not have an answer to that question but then on the other hand god is all powerful with the snap of his fingers he can do anything he wants to do in other words in this old style traditional view of what god is on one hand
POD1000000022_S0000080	god is perfect as he is pure facticity but on the other hand god is all powerful and capable of bringing about any possibility he wants in other words pure transcendence sartre would say this is no coincidence
POD1000000022_S0000081	and it is also no coincidence that as people navigate their lives they have all sorts of tactics they use to turn themselves either into somebody that ignores their possibilities and are perfect as they are right now or someone who ignores the very real unfortunate facts about themselves
POD1000000022_S0000082	and they stay lost in these unattainable dreams their entire life this is the context we needed to understand a concept we talked about well over a year ago on the one episode we did on sartre the primary tactic that people use in their lives to turn themselves into either pure facticity
POD1000000022_S0000083	or pure transcendence like god is what sartre calls bad faith let us take a look at the most famous example of bad faith that sartre lays out because we already talked about it in the other episode i will keep it brief
POD1000000022_S0000084	sartre talks about sitting in the middle of a cafe in paris watching a waiter as he does his job then you can imagine a waiter in the 1940s right dressed up in his little outfit very upright good posture very proper
POD1000000022_S0000085	he holds the tray in a particular way he walks and changes direction in a very militaristic particular way like a good waiter does sartre can not help but point out that this guy does not seem to be a self with facticity and transcendence in this moment
POD1000000022_S0000086	he seems to have relegated himself to just playing the part of a waiter he is going to the motions trying to turn himself into pure facticity just a waiter and nothing else now even though waiters do not act like this often in today is world
POD1000000022_S0000087	go to most restaurants and you can find some modern version of what sartre is talking about here i mean there is so many servers out there that have fallen into bad faith and are just sort of playing the role of the same person it seems to be a modern archetype of what it is to be a server they all say the same stuff
POD1000000022_S0000088	hi i am john i am going to be taking care you today can i get you guys started with a bottomless bucket of shrimp or some drinks or something but it is at every stage of the meal how is everything tasting for you guys you all save room for desert there is absolutely no rush i am going to leave the check here i am going to go over there
POD1000000022_S0000090	ask yourself is this the way this guy talks to his mom is this the way he talks to his best friends no he is fallen into bad faith and is just playing the part of a server now the point sartre is making is not that waiters need to be more creative it is not about waiters
POD1000000022_S0000091	sartre thinks that as human beings we have a tendency to gravitate towards this trap in all aspects of our life we make proclamations about what we are all the time i am a stay at home mom that is my identity
POD1000000022_S0000092	i am a libertarian i am a mormon and that is that what we are desperately trying to do with these proclamations is give ourselves an essence in a world where existence precedes essence
POD1000000022_S0000093	all these things are just us wanting to think about our selves as some static things set in stone and run from the possibilities that we have now when we take an honest look at the possibilities at our disposal it terrifies us and produces a feeling called nausea
POD1000000022_S0000094	and we use bad faith to quell this feeling of nausea we are constantly doing this with ourselves now if all you ever read was sartre is being and nothingness you might get the read from the book that this tendency we have to gravitate towards bad faith
POD1000000022_S0000095	is an inescapable condition of being a human being and that even when we are self aware of the bad faith we are engaging in we are still engaging in bad faith if all you ever read was the main text of being and nothingness you might get that impression and it certainly sounds like a really sad picture
POD1000000022_S0000096	but in one of the footnotes of being and nothingness sartre alludes to a way out of all of it and perhaps to an ethics that he would write later on in this life well he never writes an ethics and it may be because you know his lifelong partner
POD1000000022_S0000097	and fellow existentialist simone de beauvoir produces what many consider to be the greatest existentialist approach to ethics called the ethics of ambiguity next episode is part 2 once simone de beauvoir so we are going to be talking all about it but enough of bad faith let us get back to answering this question who am i
POD1000000022_S0000098	really here is the thing when it comes to these concepts of facticity and transcendence we have been talking about when you just think generally about the facts that are true about you and the possibilities that you have where are those things located where are you looking to find those
POD1000000022_S0000099	those things are not hidden somewhere deep down within you that only you have access to you may have a particular perspective of the facts that are true about you and the possibilities that you have but not only do you have an incentive to slip into bad faith and tell yourself a story about them
POD1000000022_S0000100	sartre would say you do not have some privileged v i p access to the facts that are true about you and the possibilities that you have i mean hypothetically any other person if they were diligent enough has access to your facticity and transcendence
POD1000000022_S0000101	in fact just like the guy that tells himself that he is napoleon sometimes other people are better at telling us who we are than we are but how is this possible the reason it is possible is because the self is not the christian soul to sartre
POD1000000022_S0000102	just like your facticity and transcendence what we are referencing when we talk about our selves is outside of us it is an abstraction it is the conglomeration of all the things you have ever actually done in your life
POD1000000022_S0000103	when you want to get a solid answer to the question who am i you do not reference the story that you tell yourself in your head that is clouded by all sorts of bad faith and wishful thinking like the guy that thinks he would try to take down the gunman at walmart
POD1000000022_S0000104	no we tell ourselves stories all the time what follows from this is that the true measure of your values the true measure of who you are is what you actually do it is the collection of what you have actually done thus far in your life and sartre says that when you stop looking at the self
POD1000000022_S0000105	as though it is the thing inside of you and you start looking at it more accurately as this abstraction that is outside of us what you inevitably start to realize is that it is impossible to ever get a full picture of who you are without referencing the way that other people view you
POD1000000022_S0000106	more than that it is impossible to ever get a full picture of being without referencing other people and mean here is what he is getting at so far when it comes to describing being we have been presented with being in itself and being for itself but it is right here fairly late in being
POD1000000022_S0000107	and nothingness that sartre lays out his 3rd ontological category what he calls being for others let us talk about what he means sartre would say that an intrinsic part of what it is to be you is existing alongside other people and all of the consequences that come along with that
POD1000000022_S0000108	this is sartre is concept of being for others now how does being for others affect my answer to the question who am i well again this concept of the self is outside of us it is an abstraction
POD1000000022_S0000109	and what sartre points out is that there are many aspects about who we are that are given to us by other people for example whether we are trustworthy or not whether or not you are a trustworthy person is an aspect of who you are that is mediated by other people right
POD1000000022_S0000110	whether i am a nice or mean person look i may think of myself as a nice person but if every single other person i encounter all throughout my life says that i am mean for all intents and purposes i am a mean person this concept of the self
POD1000000022_S0000111	and how other people view us seem to be connected to sartre but the flip side of it being that interconnected is that it leaves us an what he subscribes is a a perpetual state of being judged by the people around us
POD1000000022_S0000112	we are almost always being turned into pure facticity in other people is minds for example have you ever walk around in yourself conscious about the way you look maybe you just got a new pair of shoes and you think they look weird and as you are walking around you feel like every person that passes you is looking at you and they are thinking
POD1000000022_S0000113	wow what were they thinking when they picked out those shoes this is obviously a person that does not care very much about the way that they look in other words they are looking at you and they are turning you into an object in their subjective view of the world pure facticity
POD1000000022_S0000114	you will henceforth be known as the weird shoes guy in that person is mind this is constantly going on but sartre is not saying it is always bad that being around other people is some paranoid everybody is thinking bad things about me all the time thing
POD1000000022_S0000115	people very well may be thinking really good things about you all the time the point that sartre wants to make is that this whole dynamic this dynamic of other people seeing you putting you on trial and turning you into pure facticity in their minds this is going on all the time
POD1000000022_S0000116	simply by virtue of the fact that we exist alongside other people and that while the insights other people give us about who we are are no doubt valuable we have to be careful not to slip into bad faith on either side of this dynamic of being for others what i mean is
POD1000000022_S0000117	just because somebody sees you wearing weird shoes one day does not mean that you are now weird shoes guy in perpetuity in other words do not slip into bad faith when it comes to what people think about you no matter how convenient it may be to prescribe yourself in essence and deny your transcendence
POD1000000022_S0000118	do not turn yourself into pure facticity and just accept what other people tell you you are maybe you are weird shoes guy right now but you do not have to be in the future but the other side of that is do not deny your facticity do not tell yourself your shoes are fine
POD1000000022_S0000119	do not tell yourself that you do not care what anyone else says and that what other people think does not matter to you at all obviously it does that is slipping into another kind of bad faith
POD1000000022_S0000120	so to sum this up i guess look intuitively
POD1000000022_S0000121	it may seem to us like we have a sort of special access to knowing who we are and that we choose to share ourselves with only our closest friends we trust early but sartre would say that the reason it seems that way is cause what you actually have is a narrative about yourself
POD1000000022_S0000123	perspective and that the reason it seems like your friends reinforce this picture of who you are
POD1000000022_S0000124	is because that is the very criteria we all use to choose who our friends are going to be is whether or not they reinforce this picture that we have for ourselves that is what we like about our friends to sartre
POD1000000022_S0000125	for example if a big part of the way that you view yourself in your identity is that you consider yourself to be a smart person sartre would predict that most of your friends are going to be people that are not so smart that tell you that you are smart all the time
POD1000000022_S0000126	or people that ask you a lot of questions that you then answer making you feel smart or other smart people that commend you on being smart like them to sartre we choose our friends because they reinforce the way that we view ourselves
POD1000000022_S0000127	of course we give them privileged access to our biased narrative of ourselves
POD1000000022_S0000128	and of course it is going to feel validating of course it would seem that you know better than anyone else who you are but again sartre would say that the true measure of your values the true answer to the question who are you
POD1000000022_S0000129	is what you actually do thank you for listening i will talk to you next time
POD1000000025_S0000000	there is sort of like a before we met and an after we met and no gradient
POD1000000025_S0000001	yeah
POD1000000025_S0000002	like i do not
POD1000000025_S0000003	just like i do not even know this guy and then this is the person i work with on everything
POD1000000025_S0000004	and i am pretty sure the said to him i was like this my best friend
POD1000000025_S0000006	i am daveed diggs
POD1000000025_S0000007	i am rafael casal
POD1000000025_S0000008	and we are buddies
POD1000000025_S0000010	it is a little hard to summarize the partnership between daveed and raphael because as best friends and creative collaborators they have done so much over the years together
POD1000000025_S0000011	let me start individually daveed diggs won a tony and a grammy for his performance in hamilton
POD1000000025_S0000012	he played thomas jefferson and the marquis de lafayette in the original broadway cast
POD1000000025_S0000013	he is also the vocalist in the experimental hip hop group clipping
POD1000000025_S0000014	rafael casal is an actor writer and director he is an award winning slam poet and started appearing on h p 0 is def poetry jam at the age of 18
POD1000000025_S0000015	over the 20 years these guys have known each other they have worked in theater poetry music and film and usually in some combination of those mediums
POD1000000025_S0000016	they co wrote and co starred in the film blindspotting which premiered at the sundance film festival in 2018
POD1000000025_S0000017	and president obama named it one of his favorite movies of the year
POD1000000025_S0000018	blindspotting takes place in oakland which is also where daveed and rafael are from
POD1000000025_S0000019	their story begins at berkeley high school here is daveed
POD1000000025_S0000021	i am not sure when we met or when we were formally introduced but surely at some sort of poetry event because we were both sort of coming up in that scene
POD1000000025_S0000022	and i was older 4 years older than him
POD1000000025_S0000023	my freshman year his senior year that is a lifetime apart in high school
POD1000000025_S0000024	my memory of him in high school is like diggs always had like a very nonchalant way about him
POD1000000025_S0000025	and i do not know that this paints it accurately but this is a representation of is like at some point diggs was like i am just wearing pajama pants to school every day
POD1000000025_S0000026	and i am sure that was not the whole time i got this little window of it
POD1000000025_S0000027	it was the whole time all the high school for sure
POD1000000025_S0000029	that is amazing
POD1000000025_S0000030	it was like as a rule but we would see each other at these poetry events and he was really really good at writing poems
POD1000000025_S0000031	like a way more sort of focused writer than i had ever been in that situation you know
POD1000000025_S0000032	so i remember that i remember thinking that here is a person that is actually better than me at this thing
POD1000000025_S0000033	and that is pretty cool
POD1000000025_S0000034	then over the years also after when i was in college when i would come back home for the summers sometimes i would drop in just to watch like poetry things that were happening sort of check in on the scene
POD1000000025_S0000035	and he was like the dude he had like become that guy
POD1000000025_S0000036	and i remember that so differently
POD1000000025_S0000038	i like barely finished high school in a very in a very nontraditional way and then went off and did this show on h b 0 def poetry
POD1000000025_S0000040	this just in a skewed perspective for today is youth you all ladies aint thin enough fellows aint trim enough
POD1000000025_S0000041	want to be sexy you all do not go to the gym enough cut to commercial
POD1000000025_S0000042	came back and had just enough money saved up with some friends to open a very dungeon y recording studio and we were looking for other artists we did not have anybody else recording at the studio
POD1000000025_S0000043	and so a mutual friend of ours one of his close friends who was the older brother of one of my close friends was like you know daveed raps
POD1000000025_S0000044	yeah we really got set up on like a rapper play date
POD1000000025_S0000045	and so our friend justin was like you guys should work together you are 2 of my favorite rappers
POD1000000025_S0000046	so i was like yeah yeah and he played me stuff and it was really good
POD1000000025_S0000047	i did not have anywhere record i was recording songs in my mom is closet in the little closet in my room
POD1000000025_S0000048	i had not been in a lot of studio spaces so i was 0 studio
POD1000000025_S0000049	i do not know that this qualified as an actual i
POD1000000025_S0000050	i know that yeah
POD1000000025_S0000051	because i had not been there yet
POD1000000025_S0000052	but i do not think we had any idea like what meeting each other and actually getting time was going to be like
POD1000000025_S0000053	finally we started it was like this is the song we are going to work
POD1000000025_S0000054	we had listened through some beats and it was like let us work on this one
POD1000000025_S0000055	i just started writing and yeah it happened really fast
POD1000000025_S0000056	and at some point we looked up and everyone else was gone and it was just the 2 of us in there we were still making music
POD1000000025_S0000058	we just made music until the sun came up and like began the ritual that day of like going to the car at 8 a m
POD1000000025_S0000059	and playing everything that you would recorded and then like dragging your body home to sleep and kind of doing it all over again
POD1000000025_S0000061	i had been making music for many many years and it had never been that much fun before
POD1000000025_S0000062	suddenly there is this person that like writes a verse in 5 minutes and can nail it in a take
POD1000000025_S0000063	and at the time we were like working with some random singers and several like could not ever sing the line and rappers who took like an hour to get a verse down
POD1000000025_S0000064	it was just like wow this is so easy and then we were just have songs done
POD1000000025_S0000065	what we always joke about is like there is sort of like a before we met and an after we met and no gradient
POD1000000025_S0000066	yeah
POD1000000025_S0000068	i do not even know this guy and then this is the person i work with
POD1000000025_S0000069	on everything
POD1000000025_S0000070	and i am pretty sure this said to him i was like this is my best friend
POD1000000025_S0000072	like
POD1000000025_S0000074	as a young artist early on when i am still trying to figure things out and creating is hard for me being around somebody who just creates all the time it was so addictive
POD1000000025_S0000075	i do not have the technical skill set that rafa has so like he was so fast in pro tools
POD1000000025_S0000076	he was so all of these things that i just i would have to labor over and then all of that stuff became really impressive too
POD1000000025_S0000077	once you know as we started working together and i became aware that he had taught himself all of these things like nobody ever really showed him how to do anything it seemed like
POD1000000025_S0000078	and he was editing videos and shooting thing you know the whole range of what it takes to be a music artist like out in the world he had taught himself to do
POD1000000025_S0000079	i did not really know anybody like that
POD1000000025_S0000080	you know over the next 4 or 5 years we recorded 100s of songs that no one is heard
POD1000000025_S0000082	no one will ever hear
POD1000000025_S0000084	like shit 100s
POD1000000025_S0000085	and wrote a play together and then we lived together and it was like 0 man
POD1000000025_S0000086	when we are around each other this much it is like we have too many ideas
POD1000000025_S0000087	it was like the the right amount of proximity for like the full version of creativity that we had always
POD1000000025_S0000088	like we had thought we would already tapped it and we like did so much shit that year
POD1000000025_S0000089	yeah
POD1000000025_S0000090	i think artistically we were doing great
POD1000000025_S0000091	yeah we are definitely making it and we were definitely broke
POD1000000025_S0000093	the thing it was like
POD1000000025_S0000094	got on the radio
POD1000000025_S0000095	this is also great listen now he says we this was really rafa was known right
POD1000000025_S0000096	he had a song that got played on like clear channel radio and then got named like one of the bay area freshmen 10 it is like
POD1000000025_S0000097	best new whatever
POD1000000025_S0000098	he got named one of those but rafa never would take that for himself and it was always like us
POD1000000025_S0000099	we are and so like we played those shows together and like would end up making no money on these gigs
POD1000000025_S0000100	because he would bring me and a band like 4 or 5 other people to play music use the entire fee to fly us out to a wherever georgia and like play a show where no one would make any money but we got to play a show
POD1000000025_S0000101	he was like doing that from jump for so long
POD1000000025_S0000102	why was that how you would always do it
POD1000000025_S0000103	well cause i want to i do not i am uncomfortable with i statements
POD1000000025_S0000105	berkeley is shit
POD1000000025_S0000108	i am a good roll
POD1000000025_S0000110	they feel self indulgent
POD1000000025_S0000112	that was raised to not feed an ego that feels constantly eager for food
POD1000000025_S0000114	what i love about that period is like we were all pushing to little different degrees of success
POD1000000025_S0000115	we are just kind of weirdos that like almost in a scene that we kind of make sense in
POD1000000025_S0000116	they did not understand diggs very much at all i feel like the more commercial bay areas scene
POD1000000025_S0000117	and they only sort of understood me like it was very like yeah yeah you are in but like do not try to make any changes you know
POD1000000025_S0000118	and i think that is a big reason that we went to l a
POD1000000025_S0000119	we could see the top of the ladder and it is not getting any friendlier or more receptive
POD1000000025_S0000120	and we maybe can make this movie and maybe there is like different music opportunities down there but it is definitely not going to happen here
POD1000000025_S0000121	and then suddenly we like packed up from the west oakland place and moved to l a
POD1000000025_S0000122	also we had already been we were working on blindspotting and so we had been traveling up and down
POD1000000025_S0000123	and our producers we had been driving to meet with them really frequently
POD1000000025_S0000124	we were slumming it so hard and we got to l a we were so poor diggs was delivering tacos
POD1000000025_S0000125	yeah i was like i could not be an actor in l a is what i decided
POD1000000025_S0000126	we are just like swinging and missing
POD1000000025_S0000128	just tried to figure out like what does it mean to be in the bigger pond and like want to be artists professionally
POD1000000025_S0000129	and we did 5 years in l a before diggs went to new york to do hamilton
POD1000000025_S0000130	i think that was one of those things that came about for diggs really organically
POD1000000025_S0000131	hamilton was such an interesting like must like it was a play it was like legit written for him to flex all the things he is good at
POD1000000025_S0000132	they were like who is this like rap kid that like turns out can also act
POD1000000025_S0000133	and the rest of us were like turns out like he has been doing that more than a lot of you all you know
POD1000000025_S0000134	and the world saw diggs in the light that best showed everything and they not only accepted but obsessed over it
POD1000000025_S0000135	and then i went to visit him in new york when the show was picking up steam
POD1000000025_S0000136	and the 1st thing that happened is this girl grabs my arm and looks at diggs and goes 0 my god is that daveed diggs to me
POD1000000025_S0000137	and i like start to realize that this woman is anne hathaway like and she is like fan girling out
POD1000000025_S0000138	and i am like 0 man like a major shift is happening
POD1000000025_S0000139	my life is changing very very quickly i was under stress constantly
POD1000000025_S0000140	rafa is like calling and texting and emailing and i am like getting back to the degree that i can
POD1000000025_S0000141	and so like yes obviously it would have been like so much easier and nicer if my best friend was also living in new york and somebody who has context for me outside of this thing
POD1000000025_S0000142	and i remember like somebody turned to diggs and i was like i am thinking about moving to new york so you will respond more in person
POD1000000025_S0000143	i remember diggs goes i did not want to ask
POD1000000025_S0000145	that is like a big ask and like i am doing 8 shows a week now like move to new york and like let us go kick it in the berkshire
POD1000000025_S0000146	you know like you it was like move to new york and i will see you like at midnight sometimes
POD1000000025_S0000147	but as it was you just good for him to have a friend there but also like can i run your social media
POD1000000025_S0000149	because you are not posting enough and like people want to see this adventure and like there is a sincere way to do it
POD1000000025_S0000150	and i had done like a little bit of it with his twitter and stuff in the bay and in l a but like this was like give me your passwords i probably already had them
POD1000000025_S0000152	this was an admission that he was going to
POD1000000025_S0000154	and i was like yeah yeah do that
POD1000000025_S0000155	and especially if you actually do not have to do it
POD1000000025_S0000157	be self indulgent i am doing it
POD1000000025_S0000159	you know like like 0 there is like a year of his instagram that is just his friend is version of how awesome is
POD1000000025_S0000161	you know
POD1000000025_S0000162	blindspotting got started because around when i was 211 of my friends got killed in a way that sort of did not make a lot of sense to most people in the community
POD1000000025_S0000163	and it was sort of like the breaking point because it was a woman because it was somebody like was not really involved in the violence of the world that we were existing in at the time
POD1000000025_S0000164	some other people had been killed and other people i sort of was close to there was a series of funerals people had gone to in succession
POD1000000025_S0000165	and this was the button on it it was just like a breaking point for me
POD1000000025_S0000166	and so i had written this poem about sort of like the numbness of that experience of like god is this like what life is
POD1000000025_S0000167	it is like people die and we get numb and we care a little less every time like how does this go
POD1000000025_S0000168	and then we just kind of started coming up with a story that was a movie that is in verse starring the 2 of us
POD1000000025_S0000169	we kept almost making blindspotting and not making it
POD1000000025_S0000170	diggs he finishes this massive sensation in new york he had like 30 days in june that he could shoot this movie
POD1000000025_S0000171	22
POD1000000025_S0000172	and in a month later we were in oakland shooting the movie
POD1000000025_S0000173	in the hometown like everybody who is an extra in that movie is a friend of ours that we grew up with
POD1000000025_S0000174	and it is still not a real movie to us it is still a thing we can not believe they made
POD1000000025_S0000175	in hollywood in a world that we always assumed we did not belong in you know that we never really figured out how we would fit into anyway
POD1000000025_S0000176	to have doors start opening in a way where they are sort of asking questions about what you want to do it is crazy actually
POD1000000025_S0000177	it is just fun in meetings post blindspotting now that we are associated together in this way and also people going to able to see that rafael is a great actor as well as a great writer
POD1000000025_S0000178	like or it is like what is he doing do you think he would be interested in this
POD1000000025_S0000179	can you talk to him for us it is like pretty i love that i love that so much
POD1000000025_S0000180	and i still know the 10 things that he can do that nobody is seen yet and that is still fun for me
POD1000000025_S0000181	the closest i have ever gotten to fighting with rafa i think is like when somebody else i am close to is fighting with rafa right
POD1000000025_S0000182	i think that is sort of our good cop bad cop type of
POD1000000025_S0000183	where someone will be like venting to him and he is like i do not know what to tell you i have already picked my team
POD1000000025_S0000185	we have this expression that we always say we did this before every show and we kind of do it anytime we are at crossroads we are like
POD1000000025_S0000187	it is just like this whole ship runs on enthusiasm

POD1000000027_S0000011	it is about a scandal that rocked n b a and tells us a lot about how power race and celebrity intersect in modern sports
POD1000000027_S0000013	for this season we are excited to work with e s p n ramona shelburne one of our top n b a reporters and l a needed and someone who has been covering the story from the moment it broke
POD1000000027_S0000014	ramona is your host for all 5 episodes the quick order of warning this season contains mature subject matter and language and now coming up back the break from 30 for 30 and undefeated the stirring up fears
POD1000000027_S0000016	shelly sterling thought she was just going to return some clothes to neiman marcus when she got in her mercedes benz station wagon and made the drive from malibu to beverly hills it was early in the spring of 2000s and 14
POD1000000027_S0000017	and even though shelly was almost 80 years old she was still going into town as rich people call beverly hills 4 or 5 days a week it is hard to guess shelly is age if you do not know it
POD1000000027_S0000018	because she keeps her hair a convincing pale blonde and her face is very well maintained driving into beverly hills is basically like entering a state park for the rich and famous
POD1000000027_S0000019	there are the iconic brown and yellow signs that let you know you have entered a special place and shelly sterling and her husband donald owned a ton of it
POD1000000027_S0000020	over their 60 year marriage the sterlings built a real estate empire in their heyday they were the largest residential landlords in l a county
POD1000000027_S0000022	but most people knew her husband donald sterling as the long time owner of the los angeles clippers one of the worst owners in all of sports his team was the laughingstock of the n b a for decades
POD1000000027_S0000023	for shelly it should have been would have been just a jaunt down rodeo drive to return some wildly expensive clothes but unbeknownst to her her husband was also at neiman marcus that day
POD1000000027_S0000024	with a woman 49 years his junior named v stiviano she was not the 1st mistress not even close but v was something different
POD1000000027_S0000026	shelly told me that story when we met in the winter of 2019 at the beverly hills plaza hotel or my hotel as she calls it
POD1000000027_S0000027	shelly was 84 at the time but she can tell that story of that run in with donald and v 5 years earlier with exacting detail
POD1000000027_S0000028	i happened to be there to return something and she was there with donald and with some other friends and we had a big confrontation she was very very very nasty and mean to me
POD1000000027_S0000029	what happened was that she ran into shelly i think at nordstrom and they started talking and i guess things got out of hand
POD1000000027_S0000030	that is v stiviano is lawyer mac nehoray and when i told shelly sterling his version of the story she scoffed
POD1000000027_S0000031	it was at neiman marcus
POD1000000027_S0000032	at 1st i thought it was funny that shelly took the time to correct him i mean here is a woman talking to a female reporter about her husband is infidelity who cares whether you confront your husband is mistress outside of neiman marcus or nordys
POD1000000027_S0000033	but the details matter here it is important to get it right because that meeting outside neiman marcus that petty squabble between a wife and her husband is mistress set off a chain of events
POD1000000027_S0000034	that in the end led to one of the biggest scandals in professional sports a controversy that forced the n b a to finally deal with donald sterling after decades of his bad behavior and had ripple effects throughout the entire league
POD1000000027_S0000036	this is the sterling affairs from 30 for 30 podcasts and the undefeated i am ramona shelburne
POD1000000027_S0000039	i have covered basketball in l a for a long time the n b a is a league of huge personalities and even bigger egos fighting for power and if you want the real score that is the game you have to follow
POD1000000027_S0000041	i learned pretty quickly that there is no other owner in basketball with quite the same personality or ego of donald sterling sterling was not a basketball guy he was a personal injury lawyer and then he got filthy rich off of real estate
POD1000000027_S0000043	that is what he was really good at
POD1000000027_S0000045	i could never understand why he even kept the clippers when his reputation as an owner was so bad but that is because i always assumed that deep down he wanted what everyone in the game is supposed to want to win
POD1000000027_S0000047	but rich people like donald sterling multi $1000000000 rich people do not live in the same world as the rest of us do not play by the same rules when you have enough money it is like you are rubber everything just bounces off of you
POD1000000027_S0000048	even 3 decades of driving an n b a franchise into the ground when you are as rich as donald and shelly you get to tell yourself that everything is fabulous
POD1000000027_S0000049	i feel fabulous
POD1000000027_S0000050	feel fabulous
POD1000000027_S0000051	fabulous
POD1000000027_S0000052	he was just so fabulous
POD1000000027_S0000053	i was born and raised in l a and i have never heard anyone use the word fabulous as much as these 2 do
POD1000000027_S0000054	they were fabulous it was just fabulous
POD1000000027_S0000055	even their court battles
POD1000000027_S0000056	i want to thank everybody who has helped me my attorneys they were fabulous
POD1000000027_S0000057	and of course anything related to their team
POD1000000027_S0000058	and the u s team that won at all the fabulous american team we are fabulous let us give a hand to america u s a
POD1000000027_S0000060	and donald sterling is life was fabulous why would he think otherwise nobody ever questioned him to his face anyway he did whatever he wanted he said whatever he wanted he had relationships with whomever he wanted
POD1000000027_S0000062	i did not know v stiviano back then and yes that is her real name v just the letter v with a period she was born maria vanessa perez
POD1000000027_S0000063	but changed her name to v stiviano at about the same time she would met donald at a super bowl party in 2010 before that she had been trying desperately to climb out of the poverty that she would grown up in
POD1000000027_S0000064	she had been running a food truck business and trying to work her way onto reality t v shows and cozying up to whomever was the most relevant powerful or famous then she met donald
POD1000000027_S0000066	there is an unwritten contract between young women and their very rich but much older sugar daddies that helps each side pretend it is about love and not sex for money never talk about age pretend looks do not matter
POD1000000027_S0000067	money and hermes bags are gifts and never ever humiliate the wife but v stiviano either did not know or did not care because she broke every last rule in the mistress terms and agreements
POD1000000027_S0000068	she went right at shelly
POD1000000027_S0000069	she said to the people in the office i am going to own the office one day and she said to the clipper people she says this is going to be my team one day i mean just bold really bold
POD1000000027_S0000070	and it all got back to me you know
POD1000000027_S0000071	she kept telling people she was going to be the next missus sterling
POD1000000027_S0000072	kathrine baumann is one of shelly is best friends and a longtime clippers fan
POD1000000027_S0000073	she would stalk shelly she would watch where shelly would go and then she would show up and i do remember the one time she went into the restroom where shelly was just paraded around showed off herself then shelly walked out
POD1000000027_S0000074	at clippers games the entire extended sterling universe was usually there and usually just feet from one another sometimes shelly and donald sat in their courtside seats together and v sat in her seats directly across the court
POD1000000027_S0000075	other nights v would sit next to donald and shelly was nowhere to be seen clippers players like ryan hollins and matt barnes got used to v being around you could not not notice her
POD1000000027_S0000076	she would just parade around the arena and it like it was so awkward like we kind of know what is going on but you are doing it in front of our faces as if we were silly and so it was an odd odd situation
POD1000000027_S0000077	nobody liked her we knew why she was here and we all thought it was crazy to begin with but you know it was not our place to speak on it at the time
POD1000000027_S0000078	clippers employees often got caught in the middle of this bizarre triangle shelly would call team president andy roeser demanding that v not be allowed in the building and then donald would call roeser and ask him to leave 4 tickets for her
POD1000000027_S0000079	these were relationships begging to implode but none of the entangled ever tried to solve the problem donald shelly v each kept pushing each other waiting for someone to break
POD1000000027_S0000080	well the breaking started on christmas day 2012 v called the sterling house asking to speak to donald
POD1000000027_S0000081	we were all sitting down christmas day having dinner and she called
POD1000000027_S0000082	shelly was mortified the family was sitting at the dinner table waiting for donald as he is pacing on the tennis courts outside fighting with his mistress
POD1000000027_S0000083	i do not know they had some argument and the family heard about it you know and it just it was not a good scene
POD1000000027_S0000085	the fight with shelly started when he hung up
POD1000000027_S0000086	not that that was uncommon even without v they fought often but this was escalating shelly and donald is youngest son scott had to step in before it got physical he confronted his father and demanded he stop this nonsense with v
POD1000000027_S0000087	and stopped disrespecting his mother like this
POD1000000027_S0000089	it was a big moment but nothing came of it
POD1000000027_S0000091	a week later scott died
POD1000000027_S0000093	it was 1st reported to be a pulmonary embolism but later revealed to be an overdose he was 32
POD1000000027_S0000095	and i do not think people realize this but you lost a child
POD1000000027_S0000096	i know
POD1000000027_S0000097	right around then
POD1000000027_S0000098	january 1st
POD1000000027_S0000100	shelly was devastated
POD1000000027_S0000101	i was going through the motions of living
POD1000000027_S0000103	it was not just that the fight with v was a last volatile moment between donald and scott
POD1000000027_S0000105	when scott died donald stayed with v instead of going home to his wife as she grieved it was too much she kicked don out of the house
POD1000000027_S0000107	shelly needed breathing room and i think don had pushed the envelope a little too far
POD1000000027_S0000108	i really thought that we probably were going to be getting a divorce
POD1000000027_S0000110	but shelly and donald had been together too long been through too much together had too much of their lives and their money intertwined
POD1000000027_S0000112	they did not divorce the situation simply continued to deteriorate over the next year as donald spent more and more time with v
POD1000000027_S0000114	plus shelly was starting to learn about the gifts v posted pictures on instagram v driving the $240000 red ferrari that donald had bought her
POD1000000027_S0000115	and the range rover and the 2 bentleys shelly also found out that donald had bought v a $1800000 duplex
POD1000000027_S0000116	when i found out that he had paid for all the cars and he paid for this house i was furious
POD1000000027_S0000117	it was that anger shelly brought to neiman marcus with her returns on the fateful day she that she encountered donald and v it was not the 1st time the 2 women had run into each other or argued but this time shelly decided she would had enough
POD1000000027_S0000118	and that is when i decided i was going to sue her
POD1000000027_S0000119	on march 72014 shelly sterling filed a lawsuit in california superior court against v stiviano seeking the return of all those gifts from donald
POD1000000027_S0000121	donald and shelly sterling were worth multiple 1000000000s of dollars and had done what the ultra rich do put all their money and property into a joint trust
POD1000000027_S0000122	every dime the sterlings spent cost each of a them a nickel therefore shelly argued the money that donald used to pay for the gifts was just as much hers as it was his
POD1000000027_S0000123	so she turned to the courts that sounds a little extreme well you do not know the sterlings calling a lawyer is how they get out of bed in the morning
POD1000000027_S0000124	to say they are litigious is like saying there is traffic on the 4 or 5 and besides suing to get what they want had proven incredibly effective for the sterlings over the years
POD1000000027_S0000125	most people did not have the means or the stomach to battle them in court they would settle before they starved
POD1000000027_S0000126	she kept saying to donald you better have her drop the lawsuit and he would say 0 she will not really go through with it but she is just doing it for effect and she says well she better drop the lawsuit
POD1000000027_S0000127	but here is how the lawsuit the courtroom product of a bedroom dispute really came to change everything for some time now v had been recording her conversations with donald
POD1000000027_S0000128	sweetie i am sorry
POD1000000027_S0000129	i am so sorry too we made a giant mistake both of us
POD1000000027_S0000130	and according to v and her lawyer donald was aware she was making the tapes
POD1000000027_S0000132	he had been forgetting things he said to her and the tapes were a way of reminding him
POD1000000027_S0000134	please leave me alone please please
POD1000000027_S0000135	she would recorded 100s of conversations over the past 2 years a lot of the recordings were mundane boring even but some of the recordings were arguments and captured a side of donald that he would never want his wife or anyone else to hear
POD1000000027_S0000136	i guess that you do not know that maybe you are stupid
POD1000000027_S0000137	no matter what the original intent of those tapes was they became something v could use as blackmail because v stiviano had no intention of returning those gifts from donald
POD1000000027_S0000138	she wanted me to drop the lawsuit
POD1000000027_S0000139	v says to donald i want that bitch wife of yours lawsuit dismissed
POD1000000027_S0000140	pierce 0 donnell is shelly sterling is lawyer
POD1000000027_S0000141	and he tried to get shelly to dismiss it and she would not do it
POD1000000027_S0000142	if donald could not or would not fix the situation v decided she would take matters into her own hands it was time to use the tapes

POD1000000027_S0000161	on april 92014 a clippers executive assistant texted v on behalf of donald
POD1000000027_S0000162	the text was to make sure that v understood she was not welcome at the game against the oklahoma city thunder later that evening that her tickets her v i p pass and her parking had been revoked
POD1000000027_S0000163	v responded with a series of escalating texts saying she was going to the game anyway and then some veiled threats
POD1000000027_S0000164	i would hate for staple center to get involved in what is going on
POD1000000027_S0000165	3 hours later she got a response
POD1000000027_S0000166	mister sterling said to let me know if you need anything we do not want to have any issues at the game
POD1000000027_S0000167	v had her opening
POD1000000027_S0000168	no you tell mister sterling that i do not need anything nor do i want anything but thanks for asking let the games begin
POD1000000027_S0000170	attached to the text was an audio file and when the clippers employee opened the file she heard this
POD1000000027_S0000171	in your lousy instagram you do not have to have yourself with walking with black people
POD1000000027_S0000172	and it bothers you
POD1000000027_S0000173	yeah it bothers me a lot that you want to promote broadcast that you are associating with black people do you have to
POD1000000027_S0000174	you associate with black people
POD1000000027_S0000175	i am not you and you are not me you are supposed to be a delicate white or delicate latina girl
POD1000000027_S0000176	i am a mixed girl
POD1000000027_S0000178	it was shocking the clippers assistant immediately emailed the file to clippers president andy roeser and that is how shelly learned about the tape too
POD1000000027_S0000179	i did not even know that the tape was sent to the clippers until somebody at a game told me that they said they received a tape from her
POD1000000027_S0000180	and i said well what is the tape about so i said to andy andy roeser i said andy what are you doing about this and he says 0 well she will never do anything
POD1000000027_S0000181	roeser had worked for donald sterling for nearly 3 decades he did what everybody learns to do after a while stay out of the really ugly stuff
POD1000000027_S0000182	donald and shelly had cleaned up their own messes for 6 decades he figured they would eventually make this one go away too but they did not shelly told her lawyers about the tapes
POD1000000027_S0000183	and they in turn went to v is lawyer and demanded to hear them and that is when v stiviano made her big move
POD1000000027_S0000185	i got a call by a trusted confidential source who said you have to hear this
POD1000000027_S0000186	mike walters was the news director at t m z at the time now he runs his own celebrity news site the blast
POD1000000027_S0000187	the 1st thing i did was say who is donald sterling i had heard the name i knew that donald sterling was important but i had no idea that he owned the clippers
POD1000000027_S0000188	even for someone from t m z whose job was breaking the internet with the juiciest most controversial stories this felt like something different
POD1000000027_S0000190	i received the audio and said 0 my god
POD1000000027_S0000193	it was the most repulsive disgusting
POD1000000027_S0000195	unbelievable
POD1000000027_S0000197	audio or moment that i would ever heard in my lifetime come out of somebody is mouth that then once i realized who they were how much impact that may have
POD1000000027_S0000199	but no one in clippers world seemed to realize
POD1000000027_S0000201	the fact is shelly and several people in the clippers organization heard the recording and decided not to act on it or were not appalled enough to act on it maybe they did not understand how big a splash this tape could make
POD1000000027_S0000203	i think this deals with very touchy subjects like racism sexism
POD1000000027_S0000205	things that touch everyone in this country so i knew with all of that combined with the fact that it actually was on tape
POD1000000027_S0000207	and if i could do my job properly everyone was going to hear it that this would be a gigantic thing
POD1000000027_S0000209	so mike walters called up the n b a their new commissioner adam silver had barely been in office for 3 months
POD1000000027_S0000210	i actually had never heard of adam silver until that day
POD1000000027_S0000212	turns out not even t m z was going to release something like this without some due diligence
POD1000000027_S0000214	there is a balance between privacy of people and the public is interest in what is said in this audio and i think everyone will agree with me when i say this
POD1000000027_S0000215	this had to be heard period
POD1000000027_S0000217	after calling the league t m z called the clippers to let them know they were about to publish a tape that would be very damaging to donald sterling
POD1000000027_S0000218	if you are donald sterling there is never a good time to have your girlfriend out you as a racist if you are the clippers this could not have happened at a worse moment donald sterling is clippers had been a laughing stock for decades
POD1000000027_S0000220	because honestly like these clippers jokes is something we they are not even jokes they are statements of fact
POD1000000027_S0000222	in the 30 some odd years he had owned the team they would only made the playoffs 6 times they would never even moved past the semifinals that had all started to change in the late 2000s thought the team had drafted a star blake griffin
POD1000000027_S0000223	n b a rookie of the year blake griffin
POD1000000027_S0000225	and then ended up with another star chris paul
POD1000000027_S0000226	los angeles is electric with the addition of chris paul to the clippers
POD1000000027_S0000227	had you heard of the clippers before this
POD1000000027_S0000228	after a trade saga that rocked the n b a and somehow ended up in favor of the perennial loser clippers over the n b a is golden child the los angeles lakers
POD1000000027_S0000230	the buzz in los angeles has instantly shifted to the clippers
POD1000000027_S0000231	in time for this season the clippers had also managed to get themselves one of the best coaches in the n b a doc rivers
POD1000000027_S0000232	it is doc rivers to the clippers 3 years $21000000
POD1000000027_S0000233	there was a hope of stability balance even winning
POD1000000027_S0000235	2012 saw one playoff run 2013 saw another and 2040 was going to be the year where they might finally contend for a championship
POD1000000027_S0000236	i am excited to bring a championship here to l a in a clippers uniform
POD1000000027_S0000237	but now the clipper curse was about to rear its head yet again
POD1000000027_S0000238	the one thing i can always rely on is that the clippers screw things up
POD1000000027_S0000240	once the clippers staff found out t m z was going to publish the tape andy roeser went to coach doc rivers he needed him to talk to the team before the story broke
POD1000000027_S0000241	andy i remember coming into my office one day and said hey there is a tape that t m z has this is going to come out it is not that flattering but it is not a big deal honestly i thought it was a sex tape because donald sterling i really did
POD1000000027_S0000242	so doc did as he was told he gathered the players and warned them that something was coming superstar clippers forward blake griffin and center ryan hollins were in that room
POD1000000027_S0000243	doc gathered us
POD1000000027_S0000244	doc said hey guys we need to meet and talk
POD1000000027_S0000245	this is about to come out
POD1000000027_S0000246	we do not know what the heck this is going to turn into
POD1000000027_S0000247	people are going to run with this none of us realized the extent cause we did not hear the recording or whatever it was
POD1000000027_S0000248	he tells us to kind of prepare yourself because we are playing golden state and the focus at hand is win the game
POD1000000027_S0000249	so i think we were all kind of like alright well this is another thing we will get ready for this game
POD1000000027_S0000251	alright welcome back to sports center where we have some breaking news a disturbing story including the owner of one of the n b a playoff teams but
POD1000000027_S0000252	t m z dropped this story at 10 p m pacific time on a friday night april 25th 2014
POD1000000027_S0000253	this is an audio recording purportedly of los angeles clippers owner donald sterling making racist remarks to his girlfriend is being investigated by the national basketball association
POD1000000027_S0000254	why should you be walking publicly with black people
POD1000000027_S0000255	does it matter if they are white or blue or yellow
POD1000000027_S0000256	i guess that you do not know that maybe you are stupid
POD1000000027_S0000258	i was covering the n b a playoffs for e s p n when this scandal broke like literally i was courtside at a game in portland and i got a frantic phone call from our news desk
POD1000000027_S0000259	telling me i had to listen to this tape
POD1000000027_S0000261	people call you and tell you that i have black people on my instagram and it bothers you
POD1000000027_S0000262	yeah it bothers me a lot that you want to broadcast that you are associating with black people do you have to
POD1000000027_S0000264	suddenly the playoff game between the trail blazers and the houston rockets taking place in front of me seemed completely insignificant
POD1000000027_S0000266	i filed my game story and tried to start wrapping my head around this one
POD1000000027_S0000268	like t m z is mike walters as soon as i heard that tape i knew this was going to be huge
POD1000000027_S0000269	the disgraced clippers owner in the spotlight
POD1000000027_S0000270	sterling has a long history of questionable behavior
POD1000000027_S0000272	it is obviously appalling it is very disturbing but to be quite honest with you i was not too surprised
POD1000000027_S0000273	within hours the audio of donald sterling making racist remarks to v stiviano had gone viral
POD1000000027_S0000275	t m z is cameramen and reporters swarmed the lobby of the clippers team hotel they had booked several rooms at the 4 seasons in advance so they could legally be inside the private property
POD1000000027_S0000276	outside the hotel was even more chaotic the whole world wanted a reaction clippers team security advised players and staffers to stay inside their hotel rooms as much as possible they were on lockdown
POD1000000027_S0000277	when it came out i remember it just being chaos it just from then on it was just that is all anybody was talking about
POD1000000027_S0000278	by morning lebron james the biggest star in the league was saying there was no room for a person like donald sterling in the n b a
POD1000000027_S0000280	and across the country adam silver was facing his 1st real crisis
POD1000000027_S0000281	n b a commissioner adam silver sitting down in memphis addressing the comments made by donald sterling
POD1000000027_S0000282	the audio recording posted by t m z is truly offensive and disturbing and we intend to get to the bottom of it as quickly as possible
POD1000000027_S0000283	silver launched an investigation within hours
POD1000000027_S0000284	i am not yet prepared to discuss any potential sanctions against donald sterling we will however move extraordinarily quickly in our investigation
POD1000000027_S0000286	if it was sterling on those tapes if they had not been doctored or altered silver knew he wanted to punish him severely the league was outraged
POD1000000027_S0000287	because on top of donald sterling saying all these unforgivably racist things sterling was also taking shots at one of the most beloved figures in all of basketball magic johnson
POD1000000027_S0000289	it was as shocking and as bizarre anything on the tape that a picture of v stiviano and magic johnson had set him off to hear donald sterling talk that way about magic
POD1000000027_S0000290	the guy who would turned the lakers into a dynasty who would fought off h i v that is the guy donald sterling told his mistress was not welcome at his games
POD1000000027_S0000291	plain and simple when you heard those comments magic what was your reaction
POD1000000027_S0000292	that was really upset you know you can not understand how hurt i was he should not own a team any more especially when you have african americans renting his apartments coming to the games
POD1000000027_S0000293	and playing for him and coaching for him this is this is bad for everybody it is bad for america and so i am really upset about it
POD1000000027_S0000294	even the famously apolitical michael jordan voiced his outrage
POD1000000027_S0000295	michael jordan weighed in there is no room in the n b a or anywhere else for the kind of racism and hatred that mister sterling allegedly expressed we cannot tolerate must not tolerate discrimination at any level
POD1000000027_S0000296	but the story was bigger than the n b a it revealed something raw and ugly it triggered 1000000s of people
POD1000000027_S0000298	it is like what one of the paparazzi who was tailing donald and shelly told me it had all the elements sex money sports politics greed racism
POD1000000027_S0000299	it had everything it even had the visor you remember the visor that daft punk welding mask meets florida grandma visor that v stiviano wore any time she stepped outside her house
POD1000000027_S0000300	but still say nothing is v stiviano not late this afternoon when she arrived home or when she left tonight wearing different clothes but color coordinated face shields
POD1000000027_S0000301	the woman who set this whole thing off was out there rollerblading for the paparazzi
POD1000000027_S0000302	have you talked to mister sterling can you explain the mask
POD1000000027_S0000303	this was a full on media circus
POD1000000027_S0000304	why are you wearing the shield why are you holding a microphone
POD1000000027_S0000305	i do not know it is my job well then it is my job
POD1000000027_S0000306	by the end of the weekend the 1st black president of the united states was answering questions about sterling
POD1000000027_S0000308	i suspect that the n b a is going to deeply concerned and in resolving this you know we the united states continues to wrestle with a legacy of of race
POD1000000027_S0000309	the tapes dominated the news cycle not just because they were juicy but because donald sterling was articulating something deeper more shameful
POD1000000027_S0000311	a plantation mentality that is at the heart of a lot of this country is history
POD1000000027_S0000313	that is an n b a owner a man worth 1000000000s of dollars going on for more than 9 minutes spewing the most vile of racist thoughts a white owner whose twentyman roster was stacked with a majority of african american players
POD1000000027_S0000314	including ryan hollins
POD1000000027_S0000315	those words hurt when you hear i do not want people like that well the people like that play for you the people like that buy your tickets the people like that bleed just like you bruh
POD1000000027_S0000317	earthquakes both real and metaphorical happened suddenly but they are anything but sudden the tremor is a product of tensions that build up for years until the fault lines simply break
POD1000000027_S0000318	los angeles sits on 2 fault lines the san andreas and race all of us know it we live with it donald sterling was another
POD1000000027_S0000319	anyone who played for him or worked for him or covered him in the press or lived in one of his 100s of apartments on the one hand knew that it was all a matter of time until he blew up the underlying issues with sterling were well known and well documented
POD1000000027_S0000320	but like most insanely wealthy white men in america donald had managed to wiggle bully and fight his way out of all he knew how to play his leverage and power outlast his adversaries and win you can call it that
POD1000000027_S0000321	but this time felt different
POD1000000027_S0000323	i remember i had said this is really bad really bad and i i knew something was going to happen i did not know what it was like shock
POD1000000027_S0000325	that is what we all were shocked but we should not have been surprised
POD1000000029_S0000001	facebook is had 15 months of quote fresh hell but 2100000000 still use it or instagram or whatsapp messenger everyday
POD1000000029_S0000002	from american public media this is marketplace tech demystifying the digital economy and jack steward informally wood
POD1000000029_S0000004	despite the privacy scandals the federal investigations and the accusations of destroying democracy this week facebook reported its advertising revenue and global users are growing
POD1000000029_S0000005	in this week is quality assurance we take a deeper dive into why in its early years facebook prioritized growth over everything else
POD1000000029_S0000006	nearly every crisis facebook now faces stems from that nicholas thompson editor in chief of wired says that is left management is navigate metaphorical mind field
POD1000000029_S0000007	there was a lot of unexploded ordinance that they were inevitably going to step on it some point
POD1000000029_S0000008	he is an author on the magazine is latest cover story which goes behind the scenes of the troubled company he says facebook is business is actually solid for couple of reasons
POD1000000029_S0000009	number one the advertising business model they came up with is one of the greatest ever and it does not require lots of changes they just built an amazing business model and the marginal costs of bringing in new advertisers are very low
POD1000000029_S0000010	secondly one of the smartest business decisions that mark zuckerberg ever made was to buy instagram and people do not really understand that instagram is owned by facebook or if they distrust facebook they do not distrust instagram so instagram continues to grow
POD1000000029_S0000011	so they make lots of money off of core facebook they have lots of user growth on instagram and whatsapp and the business is doing great
POD1000000029_S0000012	you would think at some point that maybe advertisers would start to push back i mean if facebook is reputation has really taken this really huge dent that it appears it has why do people still want to advertise with it
POD1000000029_S0000013	well because the advertising continues to work if at some points people have an icky feeling when they use facebook and therefore the ads are less effective then advertisers will leave
POD1000000029_S0000014	but at this moment facebook allows you to very specifically target specific users in ways that you cannot on other platforms and for lots of advertisers that is just a deal that is too good to pass up
POD1000000029_S0000015	now facebook is anticipating once up to a $5000000000 fine from the federal trade commission we heard that from this week about how it is handled some of these privacy issues
POD1000000029_S0000016	will they even feel that is the question they have so much cash on hand is is it a big deal
POD1000000029_S0000017	no so facebook put out in their earnings call they said they anticipate a 3 to $5000000000 fine i do not know whether that is because those are the numbers the f t c has been talking about with them or if facebook is just trying to set expectations as a negotiating tactic
POD1000000029_S0000018	i would not rule out the possibility that facebook is hit with a $10000000000 fine or a $20000000000 fine regardless to your question even if it is at the higher end whether it is 5 or 10 or 20 it is tiny
POD1000000029_S0000019	their market cap is up i believe $40000000000 as we talk this morning so it is not a huge hit to them obviously they would rather have $5000000000 than not have $5000000000 but they will be fine regardless of what this number comes out at
POD1000000029_S0000020	the thing they really worry about is antitrust if there is antitrust regulation and it comes down hard on them that is a serious problem and that would make the market drop dramatically
POD1000000029_S0000021	what are the stakes for facebook is leadership around all of these scandals that the fake news the offensive content the privacy you you know you detail that they have got something like 30000 moderators now does that mean they are actually taking this seriously as a business risk
POD1000000029_S0000022	yes absolutely facebook is taking it very seriously as a business risk so there are 2 really interesting questions in there so number one is do they take this seriously as a business risk absolutely are they committed to trying to counter fake news and all of the manipulation on the platform
POD1000000029_S0000023	absolutely what are the stakes to their business they are a very high if scandal continues to multiply there could be real consequences down the road what are the stakes specifically to top management meaning mark zuckerberg and sheryl sandberg 2 people who we most associate with the company
POD1000000029_S0000024	for zuckerberg he is going to run the company as long as he wants to he has voting control of the shares he is appointed his friends as board members he is in a good position
POD1000000029_S0000025	whenever he wants to go and run the chan zuckerberg initiative or just go be an intellectual thought leader or do bill gates type things he will go choose to do that for sandberg it is tougher
POD1000000029_S0000026	and there were moments in the last year where it seemed like she might be sacrificed or where she might be in big trouble zuckerberg has expressed his loyalty to her
POD1000000029_S0000027	but as the scandals multiplied and as they started to touch her in a way they never had before it seemed as though her position was at risk and it is also certainly the case that the public reputation of both of them has dropped
POD1000000029_S0000028	a year ago we were talking about each of them as potential presidential candidates now there is not a chance
POD1000000029_S0000029	what about the morale in the wider company in the wake of all of this do you get the feeling from the people you have been talking to and your reporting that employees are fairly satisfied there and that i am laughing even as i say that or is there a whole lot of internal chaos at this company
POD1000000029_S0000030	there is a lot more employee dissatisfaction than there was 2 years
POD1000000029_S0000031	ago there are lots of employees who i talk to there who say 0 this place is great it is cool you know the media hates us but that is not my problem i am happy and there are a bunch of other people who say you know we deserve a lot of the hatred we made a lot of mistakes
POD1000000029_S0000032	we trampled on people is privacy and you know i regret all that we have done i talk to a lot of people who are thinking about going to work there and it does not have the halo that it did 2 years ago
POD1000000029_S0000033	they still pay you well the fact that the stock continues to go up is great particularly for people who have options
POD1000000029_S0000034	but it is a less exciting place to work and that is one of the true risks for the company and one of the most adverse effects of the last 2 years for facebook
POD1000000029_S0000035	did any part in this reporting particularly you know give how much time you have spent on facebook directly now did anything really surprise you
POD1000000029_S0000036	there was one specific story that stunned me and that was the circumstances that led to the departure of the 2 founders of instagram kevin systrom and mike krieger
POD1000000029_S0000037	and when fred vogelstein and i started reporting the story and we made a list of the mysteries we wanted to solve and that was at the very top why had they left it seemed strange they had left all of a sudden in september
POD1000000029_S0000038	no one knew why and late in the reporting you know months into reporting the story we finally learned the full story and that is that according to people close to them they had grown frustrated with zuckerberg is increased meddling
POD1000000029_S0000039	they did not like the idea that instagram was going to be further merged with whatsapp and with facebook and there was real tension over instagram is growth
POD1000000029_S0000040	and there was a sense among some people at facebook that instagram is growth was coming at the expense of core facebook and that led to all kinds of tensions and then a big fight at the end of july and a moment where mark zuckerberg
POD1000000029_S0000041	according to people who observing all of this asked one of his deputies to draw up a list of all the ways that facebook supported instagram the way it drove users towards instagram
POD1000000029_S0000042	and then he gave the list to kevin systrom and said we are getting rid of all of these and according to people familiar with the story systrom reacted quite badly to that and then went on paternity leave came back and said i am done here
POD1000000029_S0000043	and so the biggest surprise to us was that the departure of systrom and krieger which had not come out before was much tenser much tenser than i had believed when i began reporting the story
POD1000000029_S0000044	nick thompson editor in chief of wired for context a $5000000000 fine would be a record tech penalty in the u s bitting the 22000000 the google have to pay in 2012
POD1000000029_S0000046	and now for some related links the new york times has a good explainer on why both facebook and the f t c would be happy with a chunky fine one ends up looking strong the other looks accountable but really nothing much changes
POD1000000029_S0000047	european regulators have been tougher on tech companies google facebook and twitter all have to do more to tackle fake news to satisfy them and they want to see progress ahead of e u elections next month that is according to reuters
POD1000000029_S0000048	and even canada is getting in on the action according to the c b c this week privacy regulators there say facebook broke several laws over unauthorized data access they plan to take the company to court
POD1000000029_S0000049	if you enjoyed mark zuckerberg is testimony in front of congress here in the u s with his zinging comebacks like senator we run ads then maybe you will enjoy hearing more directly from mister zuckerberg himself
POD1000000029_S0000050	i mean facebook was accused of not being open enough i am not really sure how deep into the heads of tech entrepreneurs you really want to get but zuck has a podcast now i am not suggesting you listen i am just giving you this information
POD1000000029_S0000051	it is called tech and society with mark zuckerberg just yeah do not at me my puddy produce this weeks marketplace tech along with stephanie hughes and each row is a senior producer
POD1000000029_S0000053	i am jack stewart for now that is marketplace tech this is a p m
POD1000000029_S0000055	this is a p m
POD1000000033_S0000001	if you want to get broadband access to every state you got to know the local laws from american public media this is marketplace tech demystifying the digital economy i am molly wood
POD1000000033_S0000003	the digital economy as we like to call it over here depends pretty heavily on access to the internet and that is still not a solved problem here in the united states
POD1000000033_S0000004	over 30% of americans do not have access to broadband internet which is defined as 25 megabits per 2nd or higher that is according to research released tuesday by the n p d group
POD1000000033_S0000005	the pew charitable trusts has an initiative dedicated to figuring out why this is the case today the organization is broadband research initiative is launching a new tool that lets anyone browse through broadband policies and funding in any state in the u s
POD1000000033_S0000006	it sorts the information in categories like funding competition and regulation infrastructure access and broadband definitions
POD1000000033_S0000007	like in alabama for example broadband speed is defined as only 10 megabits for seconds if your network is busy that is barely fast enough to stream netflix and high death
POD1000000033_S0000008	kathryn de wit manages the broadband research initiative for the pew charitable trusts she told me state policy is a huge deal when it comes to expanding broadband access
POD1000000033_S0000009	state policy matters because lack of access to broadband is a national issue but it is felt at the local level and states have taken a pretty aggressive approach to closing gaps in access particularly over the last 5 years
POD1000000033_S0000010	we have seen a significant uptick in legislation since 2015 and what we can take away from this is not only do state policy makers see and feel that immediate urgency of lack of broadband access
POD1000000033_S0000011	that is they are saying it is important to things like education health care and economic developments but they are also saying this is what we want our state to look like they are setting goals and then they are laying out a path and a framework for how to achieve those goals
POD1000000033_S0000012	let us just dive into some of what is in the tool some of the different approaches that states are taking like could you give me an example of 2 totally different approaches that states might have taken
POD1000000033_S0000013	so going into this research we knew that states face similar challenges in increasing access to broadband but we learned that they are also taking similar approaches but adapting them to their needs that is really where those categories came from those groupings
POD1000000033_S0000014	if you look at goals for example you have states like minnesota and west virginia where their statewide broadband goals are focused on border to border universal coverage
POD1000000033_S0000015	then you look at a state like california that has a goal to connect 98% of the population and each one of its roughly 20 regions
POD1000000033_S0000016	how do you hope that a tool like this can help close the digital divide in terms of broadband access
POD1000000033_S0000017	well this tool is actually the 1st step in our ongoing research on how states are addressing gaps in broadband access so for us this was about understanding that 50 state landscape of broadband deployment laws
POD1000000033_S0000018	and it provides the basis for our next level of research which is a deeper examination of how states are addressing those gaps in access
POD1000000033_S0000019	what we hope though is that users will be able to use this tool to learn what other states are doing and how they are actually doing it
POD1000000033_S0000020	kathryn de wit manages the broadband research initiative for the pew charitable trusts we have got a link to that new tool and some analysis about spending per state at our website marketplace tech dot org
POD1000000033_S0000022	and now for some related links so this tool is super new obviously and pew hopes that policymakers and local governments will jump in and start creating some more analysis and comparison and of course they will be publishing their own pieces
POD1000000033_S0000023	the 1st one that i mentioned there is about how states fund their broadband projects whether it is grants or loans or general funds kind of things or some creative funding
POD1000000033_S0000024	apparently illinois makes internet service providers pay into a special coffer called the digital divide elimination fund and it uses that to pay for broadband buildouts
POD1000000033_S0000025	and in virginia a legal settlement with tobacco producers is paying to build more internet
POD1000000033_S0000026	look i am not saying this is not a little wonky over here but it is interesting also i got to be honest i am still hung up on that 10 megabits per 2nd in alabama and probably some other states too i have not made it through the entire tool yet
POD1000000033_S0000027	but alabama is regulation also says i s p is can call their upload speeds broadband at one megabit per 2nd so basically if you are at home trying to upload some photos to facebook or anything to the cloud ever
POD1000000033_S0000028	you would be doing that at speeds 10 times slower than the slowest 4 g cellphone connection set it and forget it cause it is going to take all night
POD1000000033_S0000029	another speed question is so controversial that even though pew is using the 25 megabits per 2nd speed guideline which is set by the federal communications commission network congestion usually means actual speeds are nowhere near that fast
POD1000000033_S0000030	and again a 4 g phone connection is faster than that on the best providers
POD1000000033_S0000031	it is such a big discrepancy that while pew says 21000000 americans do not have broadband microsoft put out its own map of high speed internet access back in april
POD1000000033_S0000032	it said the real number of people without appropriately fast internet access for today is economy is more like a 163000000 in the united states alone
POD1000000033_S0000034	i am molly wood and that is marketplace tech
POD1000000033_S0000036	this is a p m
POD1000000038_S0000001	let us take a break from real life for a moment to visit the somewhat near future on t v
POD1000000038_S0000002	although i have to warn you that is kinda dark too
POD1000000038_S0000003	from american public media this is marketplace tech de mystifying the digital economy i am molly wood
POD1000000038_S0000005	the b b c h b 0 show years and years combines the politics economy and tech of 2019 and imagines how it all might evolve over the next 15 years
POD1000000038_S0000006	emma thompson is in it as a celebrity british politician with autocratic leanings but mainly the show follows a family as they deal with the world changing around them
POD1000000038_S0000007	russell t davies created and wrote years and years he is also worked on shows doctor who torchwood and created queer as folk
POD1000000038_S0000008	he said the tech in years and years is like life it is complicated
POD1000000038_S0000010	show good and bad i think some of the saddest moments is is you you have a world war being announced on television and the little 56 year old kids just sit and staring into their phones playing their games
POD1000000038_S0000011	so yes there is bad stuff but that is very easy to talk about and yet there is very very good stuff i tell you actually when i made the choice to center this around a family
POD1000000038_S0000012	that came from one of the good sides of current tech which is very simply the whatsapp group i am one of 3 kids and 2 sisters have 2 kids each we are a nice family we all like each other we get along
POD1000000038_S0000013	but up until a couple of years ago as my nieces have grown up 23 years ago i would have texted them twice a year happy birthday and merry christmas now 0 my god i went out the other night and i came back to the whatsapp group 53 messages
POD1000000038_S0000015	because someone had cooked a lasagna with butternut squash so yes there is good stuff if you choose either good or either bad you are not make it right you have got to get both in there because in the end it is not the technology it is it is the people
POD1000000038_S0000016	well it is great because some of the tech feels really immediate like a headband that projects a holographic sort of snapchat filter for your face that everyone can see in the physical world it is futuristic but it is also completely realistic
POD1000000038_S0000017	yes yes i think if that was invented tomorrow we would all go and buy one i mean i find those filters fascinating
POD1000000038_S0000019	sends each other photos of themselves looking like a dog
POD1000000038_S0000021	rash of instagram filters like what dog are you or what cake are you i am certainly a battenberg but i love those filters and i am fascinated by the way we love those filters
POD1000000038_S0000022	and so the moment someone invents a filter you can see in the real world not just on your phone 0 my god i would be phoning you from my palace on the moon
POD1000000038_S0000023	do you have conflicting you know feelings about tech or is it like so many things where it just reflects the real world
POD1000000038_S0000024	yeah it is interesting i think it is both i think i think you have to be entertaining but entertaining does not mean being glib or daft i think i am getting older i think my stuff is full of warnings now to be honest it is funny now i am in the middle of an edit of my next drama
POD1000000038_S0000026	h b 0 max over there which is about the aids crisis of the 1980s
POD1000000038_S0000028	i have just watched an edit of an episode warning about viruses and we step out of our front doors and there is a virus on the loose it is you can not learn those lessons from history enough strangely what a world
POD1000000038_S0000029	i was telling people that i am taking a little bit of comfort in a darker timeline like there is something comforting about the passage of time right like you fast forward in these episodes and increasingly terrible things happen but also
POD1000000038_S0000030	people are still living their normal lives talk to me about the sense of perspective
POD1000000038_S0000031	yes that is right i mean it is it was quite a hard show to sell initially with its concept of moving forward in time and every episode moves forward a year but actually i sat there saying
POD1000000038_S0000033	been questioned about 57 times
POD1000000038_S0000035	do you know what else moves forward a year in every episode downton abbey
POD1000000038_S0000036	and so did upstairs downstairs many years ago it is actually not a form of drama i have invented it is simply that this drama is going to the future by a year every episode that had people scared but in terms of drama in terms of how the characters are getting on who loves who
POD1000000038_S0000037	who is going out with who who is cross with who who loves who to take yearly jumps in there it is a very simple dramatic device so
POD1000000038_S0000038	i knew that would work i had the the confidence of those those forebears to say this will work and
POD1000000038_S0000039	and it was to get sort of creep into the story which which is
POD1000000038_S0000041	in in societies when dictators arise or where huge changes are made and and where society might swing from left to right or right to left it does not happen overnight that is why i wanted
POD1000000038_S0000042	what ends up as like a 15 year span on the show is is to show show these things slowly creeping up on you and actually you are more concerned with having a tea or or falling in love
POD1000000038_S0000043	or or having a divorce that is actually the stuff the meat and drink of your life while the bigger shadows are falling on you unseen so i needed that stretch to show the small picture of people living within a bigger picture
POD1000000038_S0000044	so episode 6 introduces a virus and with the coronavirus is happening right now i wonder is that something you would have done differently
POD1000000038_S0000045	in the show was that just one of the many serve things going on in the future
POD1000000038_S0000046	it is interesting cause cause actually it comes up in episode 6 as as a means of isolating people within the story to to be honest now i am seeing a virus like this in action
POD1000000038_S0000047	it it would have dominated episode 6 too much it is amazing how it dominates every conversation now and episode 6 as a drama not not as a document of the real world but as a drama has stories to wrap up
POD1000000038_S0000049	we need to know
POD1000000038_S0000050	whether lovers will be reunited whether marriages will stay together so it is very interesting now that i thought think that is i have had done a lot of research into viruses and what would happen so i kind of you know i knew i knew the differences between endemics and pandemics
POD1000000038_S0000051	but i chose the background it and this is a separate drama in itself really my goodness this is some strange days again just keep getting madder what did we used to talk about in 2006 what what did we talk about can you remember interest rates
POD1000000038_S0000052	cows and cattle what did we talk about guinea pigs i do not know
POD1000000038_S0000053	i can not remember what we talked about 2 weeks ago even i mean do you feel anxious like when you reach inside creatively and and pull out
POD1000000038_S0000054	what in some ways it is like the worst case scenario that we are imagining our brains and put them on screen does that make you anxious
POD1000000038_S0000056	talking about my my family that lovely family i was just describing one of my nieces has just had twins that is one year ago lovely lovely baby twins and and that makes me anxious i look at them thinking
POD1000000038_S0000057	you know i do believe in global warming i do believe we are in trouble i do believe that as a result the political situations i think that the the the heating up of our political situation is tied into global warming
POD1000000038_S0000058	on a vast scale that is very you for the 1st time in my life i feel for little kids thinking i am not sure you will have a better world i am not sure at all you will so i have got anxiety and and as a writer that is bound to come out in my work
POD1000000038_S0000059	i do have to say that years and years does have a happy ending happy ish ending sort of bittersweet but it is a happy ending because i also believe in that i also i think real life could be disastrous enough when you are writing fiction you should reach for a happy ending
POD1000000038_S0000060	because it is hard work happy endings are tough to find and and miserable endings are easy so i try to look for hope in it and i do have hope in people actually that
POD1000000038_S0000061	we are great survivors and great thinkers and actually i think most people are nice i think people are fundamentally nice that word we are not allowed to use nice because it seems like a bland word but i think it is a beautiful word people are nice
POD1000000038_S0000062	i have to hope that our niceness prevails

POD1000000047_S0000000	welcome to the 8000 hours podcast this interview with david spiegelhalter is a bit unusual and that was actually recorded 2 years ago
POD1000000047_S0000002	we will considering a starting podcast back then and i recorded this trial episode with my colleague jess whittlestone but ultimately we did not have the time to go on ahead with the project but i thought why not dig it up and release it now
POD1000000047_S0000004	david spiegelhalter is a statistician at the university of cambridge and something of an academic celebrity in the u k
POD1000000047_S0000006	part of his role is to improve the public understanding of risk especially everyday risks we face like getting cancer or dying in a car crash as a result he is regularly in the media explaining the numbers in the news
POD1000000047_S0000007	trying to assist both ordinary people and politicians to focus on the most important risks that confront us and avoid being distracted by flashy risks that perhaps do not actually have that much impact
POD1000000047_S0000009	to help make sense of the uncertainties we face in life he is had to invent concepts like the micro life or a 30 minute change in life expectancy
POD1000000047_S0000011	we gave him a call because we wanted to learn weather he thought a lifetime of work had actually made that much difference to the world enjoy
POD1000000047_S0000013	here at the center for effective altruism we are interested in finding ways to compare what it means to do good and to figure out which ways of doing good do the most good so we ask question like which charity should you donate to if you want to help as many people as possible
POD1000000047_S0000014	what careers should you follow if you want to improve the world and which cause areas have the largest impact these are the sorts of questions that we think it really important to get clear so you know how you can make a real difference
POD1000000047_S0000016	to help us answer some of these questions we are joined by professor david spiegelhalter the wilton professor for the public understanding of risk at cambridge university professor spiegelhalter spent much of his life trying to improve public understanding of statistics science and risk in ordinary life
POD1000000047_S0000018	he regularly appears in the u k media and writes on his blog understanding uncertainly it is great to have you with us today david
POD1000000047_S0000019	hi
POD1000000047_S0000021	so we have got so many things we would like to talk about we will see how far we get but 1st tell us a bit about your who you are and your position
POD1000000047_S0000022	yeah yeah i have got a strange job really i am in the math is department at cambridge and i teach statistics to the undergraduates but i am actually funded by a hedge fund winton capital management and and that much in order to improve
POD1000000047_S0000023	the public understanding of statics and risk and so what i have done since i have had that job for the last 8 years is i suppose to try to join the general community of people who are
POD1000000047_S0000024	trying to improve the way numbers in particular are discussed in society
POD1000000047_S0000026	so what kinds of questions do you research and what outreach do you do to help the public understand numbers and uncertainly better
POD1000000047_S0000027	well i get asked to do a huge amount of stuff i suppose helping in various agencies communicating risk you know about certain cancer risk about the risk of the the the screening for example risks and benefits of screening i i my background is in medical statistics
POD1000000047_S0000028	so that is what i get to do quite a lot but i have done t v programs about climate change i have done radio stuff about you know all sorts of threats to society from fukushima and and so on
POD1000000047_S0000029	and everything to do with and trying to get a handle on you know what are the important threats to to us individually and what would why my how we might go to make comparisons between between them so
POD1000000047_S0000030	i i m very interested in rather than the great global existential risks so i am more interested in the things that affect us all individually about how we eat or exercise and transport and so on
POD1000000047_S0000032	so yeah one of the things that i find very interesting in this area is that there is a lot of evidence that people tend to be very poor at estimating lots of different probabilities and so end up
POD1000000047_S0000033	overestimating the scale of the some problems of risk that they face and underestimating others from your experience what kinds of problems do you think that people tend to be most prone to overestimate or underestimate and get wrong in very harmful ways
POD1000000047_S0000034	well the the there has been a lot of research on this by psychologists as you know and and it was when we talk about people i always include myself in this
POD1000000047_S0000035	you know i am a subject to the whims my emotional gut reactions as much as anybody else so i m not making any claim about some superior knowledge and rationality compared with everybody else because
POD1000000047_S0000036	we just know that the way we respond to things you know to simplify you know we can think in 2 different ways we can respond with our guts or we can try to engage our brain and think slowly about stuff
POD1000000047_S0000037	and and this so relevant when it comes to risk and particularly this idea the what what what is available to us is availability heuristic is very strong that
POD1000000047_S0000038	what we hear in the news we we hear about ebola we hear about terrorism we hear about you know the latest threats that might that might be in what we need some way we travel and we get very concerned about this well there is a plane crash or whatever
POD1000000047_S0000039	and because that is what is in the news that is what is is available to us so you know this what so prominent but of course so many of these risks are actually very small indeed this is not a threat to us particular at all
POD1000000047_S0000040	and and the things that are much more familiar we do not hear much of you know for example just in heart disease cancer all the other stuff that we get and largely the amount of that is because of the way we live our lack of exercise our crummy diet
POD1000000047_S0000041	and so on of course is people get a bit bored with that because and and do not get so concerned about it
POD1000000047_S0000042	do you feel you have had any success improving public understanding of risks and getting people to focus on the stuff that really matters
POD1000000047_S0000043	0 i do not know it is right from asia i mean it would be great to think so and yeah i have been involved in some good projects with me i am proud of for example the redesign the cancer screening leaflet in the u k which present the benefits and risks
POD1000000047_S0000044	cancer screening in a in a very balanced way they they hugely innovates it innovate it is that they do not actually recommend people go for screening they they just say these are the possible benefits
POD1000000047_S0000045	these are the possible harms make up your own mind and i i believe that is the right way to go about communicating risk is not to say 0 you have got to watch you have got to watch out this is terrible say well if you do this this might happen or it might not happen
POD1000000047_S0000046	and weigh it up and and actually you may give people credit for some intelligence which i think people basically are do not think people are so stupid but i am proud of is being part of a general community that is very strong in britain to do with public engagement in science
POD1000000047_S0000047	and
POD1000000047_S0000049	which i am just the small part of that because it covers the materials on the radio stuff on television stuff in in some newspapers and in various agencies for example the statistics authority
POD1000000047_S0000050	which is just trying to take a much more critical attitude to the way that numbers and evidence are used in society and i think it is it works in in britain we are rather good compared with most people about
POD1000000047_S0000052	we do not have these massive fears of of vaccinations of nuclear power of of even g m os and and so i i i think this is a sign that we in this country have developed quite a good public engagement with science community
POD1000000047_S0000054	yeah i was actually going to ask you about what potential you think there is for young people who want to have an impact on their career going into a career path similar to your own and trying to get into public outreach and engagement to
POD1000000047_S0000055	to have a broader impact rather than necessarily just doing research and academia so how hard do you think it is to do this kind of thing and is it it sounds like this is definitely something you wish more academics did work on
POD1000000047_S0000056	absolutely i mean i i really came to it quite late as as a real part of my career as i said again because a philanthropist and in a hedge fund and that provided the funding to be able to do this full time
POD1000000047_S0000057	but i was doing some before as part of my job and i increasingly feel that its actually a duty of academics who after all are publicly funded for a certain proportion of them to really spend some time on public engagement it does not suit everybody
POD1000000047_S0000058	not everybody at all although everybody should have a website explaining what they do and and that they should be also supported and there should be incentives within the career structure for academics to do this
POD1000000047_S0000059	i am quite pleased in cambridge for example when we are looking at promotion of people their public engagement is taken very seriously indeed it is something i i i strongly support so it is not everybody but i think it is a very important thing for academics to do
POD1000000047_S0000060	and as they are doing their work it was in whatever area it has a relevance to society and it can potentially
POD1000000047_S0000062	improve society and they should be working on it
POD1000000047_S0000063	i i personally think statistics is a particularly important area for improvement of society and i feel this very strongly and many statisticians do in terms of public engagement
POD1000000047_S0000064	the royal statistical society has now got an initiative of training up statistics ambassadors young statisticians who who want to do this who really want to get out there and communicate the importance of their work and try to improve the way things are done with numbers and evidence
POD1000000047_S0000065	i think this is so exciting such fun
POD1000000047_S0000067	so a lot of young people we meet are thinking of going into academia do feel like that is a a good place to be to have a big impact in the world of course there are also some drawbacks that you might be aware of from your experience of being in academia
POD1000000047_S0000068	yes yeah i am not i would not necessarily say you know to recommend yes you really should go into academia and you know it does not suit everybody and and frankly when did i started it is quite yeah it is very tough now
POD1000000047_S0000069	in most careers there seems to be a lot more pressures on than there used to be so it is quite can be quite a tough call i think but there is potential to do a lot of good stuff and you know people work people i work with and know in other areas whether they are working in
POD1000000047_S0000070	natural natural you know natural threats natural disasters when they are working in botany whether they are working any area and plant sciences whatever are a really dedicated to trying to improve
POD1000000047_S0000071	a lot of the world and i am i am so impressed by the dedication but it is a tough job and you do not necessarily see in this sort of push to the other publish the work you have got to do all this you have got to go through all the 7th
POD1000000047_S0000073	all this business in order to build one is career it does not necessarily appear at 1st that you are actually doing a great and good in what you do very little of it you can see a direct impact however as i know that i am you know what is very good about it is that
POD1000000047_S0000074	it it is it is building a lot of transferable skills that you can use i find that in my statistical skills for example are in a massive demand and by all sorts of agencies i could point in particular to the
POD1000000047_S0000075	importance of the millennial development goals and the sustainable development goals which are which are
POD1000000047_S0000076	well which are replacing them in which they sort of monitoring of the state of of of the welfare in different countries around the world has become absolutely vital and just being able to measure things and know what is going on and
POD1000000047_S0000077	to develop good ways to do surveys actually look at what works and how how you can improve these measures it is has become enormously vital enormously important so i i think well again i am coming back to i think statistics is
POD1000000047_S0000078	particularly valuable area to go into
POD1000000047_S0000080	yeah absolutely and just a little bit more broadly the key idea behind effective altruism is that we want to try and figure out which altruistic activities which charities which career paths which causes do the most goods we think that being able to
POD1000000047_S0000081	measure things or at least trying to measure things is incredibly valuable in making progress on those questions but obviously these are many of these questions are incredibly difficult to answer so a common criticism that we often get is people saying something like
POD1000000047_S0000082	0 it is impossible to figure out which charities or careers do the most good so you are wasting your tough time trying and you should just go with your gut or you know help personal causes what do you think of this kind of objection and do you think there is anything to it
POD1000000047_S0000083	you know concern about there being too much uncertainty you know we often respond by saying that you know it does not mean that we should not try and estimating this clearly the best we have but yeah what are your thoughts on this challenge
POD1000000047_S0000085	i mean this is not a a comment that is just restricted to the area that you are talking about it happens all the time used to happen in healthcare it is said 0 you can not put a value on a human life
POD1000000047_S0000086	we have just go to do all we can to do good and we have to just go with our guts essentially no that this that view now certainly in the u k has been completely discredited you can put a value on a human life we do all the time
POD1000000047_S0000087	i am sure everyone would agree that
POD1000000047_S0000088	not sure everyone you can agree and of course
POD1000000047_S0000089	but you have to
POD1000000047_S0000090	but nice for example has been doing this for over a decade
POD1000000047_S0000092	putting the value on the marginal benefit of particular healthcare intervention and assessing what should be supported under national health service according to reach all the criteria and we know this is not perfect we know this does not measure everything
POD1000000047_S0000093	but it is explicit it is transparent and they have done their best and i think it is a massive success and a huge example for other countries how you can go about it now we know it is a it is never perfect it is never perfect
POD1000000047_S0000094	but because people then trying to take that approach which i think has been extremely beneficial in healthcare and move it into all other areas now how can you do it so people are trying to do it with the environment and how can we measure the value of a tree well people are trying to measure the value of a tree
POD1000000047_S0000095	and i know what the value of a tree is worth and it is quite a lot but
POD1000000047_S0000097	working out all these different trying to measure the benefit of a or how the sustainable environment et cetera what is the value of a species what is the value of this
POD1000000047_S0000098	i mean i mean it seems it is it is too easy to sit back and say 0 you can not do it you can not measure that well well you can have a good go you can have a good go so as you say it is always a balance between trying your best realizing you are never going to be able to do it
POD1000000047_S0000099	but not to be put off having a good go so it it is like a lot of things we do in statistics trying to measure things trying to model things that we always know what we do is inadequate but that does not mean we can not do useful things
POD1000000047_S0000101	can you tell us a bit more about nice and how they prioritized health treatments within the united kingdom
POD1000000047_S0000102	yeah i mean that is something i have worked on a medical statistician i would be in a huge support of nice and essentially what they what they do is when they decide whether decide to have a new vaccine or whether decide to have a new recommend
POD1000000047_S0000103	so for drugs to be paid for under the n h s for example they will look at what is the expected benefit of that of that intervention and what is the expected cost and then they look at how much it is going to cost to
POD1000000047_S0000104	and provide an extra or they call it qaly a quality adjusted life year so one year of life it is discounted if it is poor quality you will you will you will you will discount it it will not be worth a whole year and essentially they can make a comparison
POD1000000047_S0000105	and they look if something comes in less than £20000 of qaly just when they just paid for you know just yep fine we will pay for it under the n h s if it is more than about 30000 then they really try
POD1000000047_S0000107	we do not want to pay for this
POD1000000047_S0000108	and try to go back to the drug company to renegotiate a price for example between 50000 wow you know that is that is more in the gray zone so and this has been enormously beneficial partly
POD1000000047_S0000109	in order to go back to drug companies and get them to reduce their prices but and also to see that some interventions for example cancer screening come in extremely cheap they are just worth doing it it also means you have to be explicit for example in how much you value the future
POD1000000047_S0000110	rather than the present because they put in a discount rate currently 3.5% and now that means that a year of life in 25 years time for example is only worth about half what a year of life now is worth and and that is taken into account
POD1000000047_S0000111	and now that that of course is controversial and if we are talking about big policy decisions for example about climate change that is far too big a discount rate we would not care less about the world in 100 years time if we used that discount rate so in different areas
POD1000000047_S0000112	you might be wanting to use a different dis discount rate but these are taking economic ideas and moving them into very human decisions
POD1000000047_S0000113	and i think they are enormously helpful and illuminating but they are never perfect
POD1000000047_S0000115	yeah i have actually written an article with professor toby ord about why we should not discount health even though we should discount financial returns about why why it is appropriate in one case and not in the other so we will put up a link to that on the website so
POD1000000047_S0000116	a lot of people who are planning out their careers they feel just overwhelmed by uncertainty they they do not know how much they are going to earn in one career or what is the chances of getting into academia or being elected to parliament
POD1000000047_S0000117	how do you think people ought to make decisions when they are just surrounded by so much uncertainty
POD1000000047_S0000118	well i mean you could say that we are always surrounded about this again this is common to everything we do we never know what is going to happen in the future which is great people do not do not want to know what is going to to happen in the future people do not even know what what they want what they are going to get for christmas let alone what is going to happen for the rest of their lives
POD1000000047_S0000119	and so the this is just a common problem and we need to distinguish what we might call risk and uncertainty risk is when it is a very well defined problem there is short term issues and buying lottery tickets when you know what the chances are
POD1000000047_S0000120	and then we can also take a rational approach when we are dealing with deeper uncertainty when really are not even sure what the options are of how our lives might develop then it is very difficult to take a completely formal approach and say i would not
POD1000000047_S0000121	try to say 0 we should be able to do all this mathematically at all however the basics of qualitive ideas of thinking through a rational decision are still very valuable because you think of you know what are the options available
POD1000000047_S0000122	what are the possibilities and you know what are the possible consequences of what i might do now that is always inadequate you are never going to be able to think about the thing and however by thinking through that some things might come immediately apparent some immediate rankings of
POD1000000047_S0000123	what is preferable and not preferable might become apparent and otherwise you we might need to fall back and think on on broader strategies for making decisions in the face of
POD1000000047_S0000124	what we call deeper uncertainty now this is a deeply contested area and when governments make policies very often they are in these situations where they they can not even think of all the things that might happen so the they are in the situation of deeper uncertainty
POD1000000047_S0000125	and people have tested various ways to go about it the 1st thing is to not to think that you can optimize you can not be perfect you you cannot be perfect so there are sort of suggestions of people make in terms of general decision making in these contexts
POD1000000047_S0000126	so to do with flexibility and resilience so you want to be you want you do not want to commit yourself to something you are not going to be able to change because you can not predict everything that is going to happen so you build in flexibility and adaptivity to your decision
POD1000000047_S0000127	and that is the same in any business any government any any project at all the other thing is building resilience in which you are are essentially can cope with the unexpected and things and that means both and you know the possibility of really good things happening
POD1000000047_S0000128	as well as the possibility of really bad things happening that you are making sure that you have not put all your eggs in one basket essentially so if something goes wrong you have not completely gone up a total blind alley that you can not renegotiate
POD1000000047_S0000129	which means operating from a basis most robust basis as possible so it means not trying to optimize the single path but building in robustness which means yeah i think in in terms of career of course building in
POD1000000047_S0000130	transferable skills you are going to be able to use in a variety of circumstances so i think these are standard tactics to respond to deeper uncertainty and which can be used in any in any situation
POD1000000047_S0000132	yeah that is definitely something that the organization 8000 hours to advise people on you know how to have a big impact with a career is really focus on is specially early in your career like keep your options open choose things that are robust under you know in a lot of different possible things happening
POD1000000047_S0000134	one other question that we find we come up against a fair amount in thinking about careers and charities and all kinds of things is you know how do you go about choosing between a small chance of some really huge outcome like you know saving the world from a pandemic that kills 1000000s
POD1000000047_S0000136	against some high probability of a very moderate or a more moderate outcome sooner helping people in your like of community this seems like a very difficult thing to deal with do you have any thoughts on how people can go about making these kinds of decisions
POD1000000047_S0000137	yeah very difficult but again these are common decisions in our in always in our lives do we go for the high risk option or or the safer or the safer option and i i personally think that
POD1000000047_S0000138	actually a a mixed strategy is something that businesses i think would recommend although that is not what i do i am not involved in in any investment decisions but often when i think people take an idea of portfolio
POD1000000047_S0000139	of risk taking because these are all risks you can not guarantee with anything that you do and these are all risks and so you that might have a certain amount invested in rather safe things with a safe return you are pretty sure
POD1000000047_S0000140	that what you are going to do is going to have a reasonable return and that you really can predict the consequences of what you are what you are using your career or your money for what you are getting for on the other hand on more speculative
POD1000000047_S0000141	you you might be supporting something that actually might not come to now come to anything either because the solution it is promising
POD1000000047_S0000142	and will not work or the threat will not arise in the 1st place so i i i think actually a mixed strategy in these circumstances again you know i would not want to just put all the eggs in one basket so it is just
POD1000000047_S0000144	that would not be appropriate i also personally feel that that this is completely my personal reaction that i give is that i i quite like a mixed strategy in which some of things are the the bigger
POD1000000047_S0000146	slightly anonymous
POD1000000047_S0000147	trying to where you you are all giving money
POD1000000047_S0000149	large organization is doing something which is contributing in a pro probably fairly predictable way to to to improving things with people versus you know the more personal ones where you do have the personal
POD1000000047_S0000150	contact and and you might get slightly more some emotional feedback from them partly because they might encourage you to perhaps take on a more the feedback from the altruism might encourage you to take on a bigger after all
POD1000000047_S0000151	a a bigger commitment to the future
POD1000000047_S0000153	so there are various way of thinking about how to quantify the risks of possible gains associated with an activity can you explain what a micro mode or a micro life is
POD1000000047_S0000154	0 yeah yeah these are units that well i invented the micro life someone else invented the micromort it is just it is just a way of trying to get a common scale for you know particularly because a micromort is acute risks things that might kill you on the spot but otherwise you are healthy
POD1000000047_S0000155	and it is a one in a 1000000 chance of dying because of an action you might take so skydiving or something is approximately 7 to 10 micromorts and and then micro life which is something to do with chronic risks which is the risk of
POD1000000047_S0000156	i think we can start on quite interesting which is bad lifestyle yeah lack of exercise or smoking or drinking or and yeah bad diet whatever which is not going to kill you on the spot but
POD1000000047_S0000157	will short his life likely to shorten your life definitely not definitely at all maybe not but probably will and so it is a reduction of half an hour in the life expectancy i find these quite useful because it enables you to compare all these different
POD1000000047_S0000158	things like diet and smoking and exercise and things like and and makes me for example but you know smoking is where you you know the biggest return or the biggest you know in terms of not smoking but the huge biggest return and
POD1000000047_S0000160	drinking at low doses well actually it does not make much difference
POD1000000047_S0000162	huge a huge concern unless you are really swigging it down but exercise again i think it is extremely important and and diet is important and and
POD1000000047_S0000163	it it just gives you a feeling of what is you know where the you know where the priorities are which of course it is all a bit obvious that the priorities that people do in public health but it makes you slightly unconcerned about other things that people might be really concerned
POD1000000047_S0000165	so these these concept were invented to help people get a better understanding and make better decisions do you think that we could invent new concepts to help people think about how they can do more good in the world
POD1000000047_S0000167	yeah you know a microaltrue
POD1000000047_S0000169	it is difficult i mean the qaly is a start is a good one if you are really if you are if your area of cause is is to do with saving lives and improving health and lethal risk to the people then qaly is is a good one it is already established you can look at how many
POD1000000047_S0000171	so how many years of life are you going to gain for and from your intervention and and and we know that you know if you are giving money for to some particular charities
POD1000000047_S0000173	promote
POD1000000047_S0000174	you know they are extremely cost effective in that way
POD1000000047_S0000175	it is more difficult if you have the broader idea for example of of of supporting education of of preserving the environment actual environment and so on quite hard to put a a number on that within a within a particular area cause
POD1000000047_S0000176	cause then you might be able to do it but provide having metrics that
POD1000000047_S0000178	go right across different areas
POD1000000047_S0000180	is is difficult and i know that you know people criticize that
POD1000000047_S0000182	attempts to do
POD1000000047_S0000183	i still think it is worth trying to do i mean and people struggling to do this within
POD1000000047_S0000185	within the within environment and so on i do not think i have got any great idea to be honest to i mean one possibility of course is
POD1000000047_S0000186	is looking at with general measures of well being which again people are doing it is measured by national governments now to try to measure well being in terms of how people feel about the about they are lives and and
POD1000000047_S0000187	so general well being indices which are not just i mean you know health related or length of life related and i think have got have got great potential but it is not going to right you are not you are not going to be able to get the perfect measure on them
POD1000000047_S0000188	so people are often asked you know how would you rate how good your life is going from one to 10 you know typically they give answers between 6 and 8 at least in the u k
POD1000000047_S0000189	maybe we could have a micro happy which should be something as good as moving someone from 6 to 7 or 7 to 8 on this welfare scale
POD1000000047_S0000190	yeah yeah yeah no i am yes yeah yeah exactly i think that no the scales well actually i find them very revealing when people do measure them particular cross culture as you said
POD1000000047_S0000192	everyone says 7
POD1000000047_S0000194	maybe cause i like number 7 but it also reflexes this idea why it is not bad you know
POD1000000047_S0000195	must not grumble
POD1000000047_S0000197	you know could be better but must not grumble you know so slightly british stoic attitude so i think it is almost predictable what people are going to respond but i find for example the age distribution of these responses and how the age distribution varies across cultures
POD1000000047_S0000198	extremely interesting and the idea of you know whether one could move
POD1000000047_S0000200	you know groups of people on that scale and would be very important and when i think of little charities and some of the ones i i i give to the you know
POD1000000047_S0000201	which are are not directly i do not think anyone could actually make people live longer but you would hope to would improve people is well being and sense of happiness and considerably
POD1000000047_S0000202	yeah it is a fascinating area of a research and and there are significant international differences so i think in the u k and america and australia people do tend to give 7 or maybe 8 if they are feeling particularly good but in south america people are just for some reason more exuberant
POD1000000047_S0000203	and tend to often give 8s even even when they are relatively poor but by contrast in eastern europe and eastern asia like japan and china people tend to give relatively low scores relative to how life they well seems to seems to be going from the outside
POD1000000047_S0000204	yeah yeah yeah no no people in different cultures i think in africa they are even lower people are very
POD1000000047_S0000206	yeah there are some countries that where the average is as low as 4 out of 10 which may maybe half of people are giving less than 4 which is a bit unfortunate
POD1000000047_S0000207	for the gain i mean these are i they are they are very culturally and i think specific and so and but i think what i want to see is relative changes relative changes perhaps you know compared with
POD1000000047_S0000208	the average in that in that community that one would for you and you can not just get everyone up to 8 or whatever i mean there are very different cultural attitudes to do with i think that are reflected in those questions
POD1000000047_S0000209	yeah so by trying to estimate risks or the size of problems in this quantitative way do you think we risk being biased against approaches that are harder to quantify
POD1000000047_S0000210	yeah i think it always is a problem that people start believing you know that the model the measure which is a only a very inadequate thing starts trying to starts becoming the thing that you are in fact then trying to you know you are focused on
POD1000000047_S0000211	to the detriment of all others you mean and and there is a real problem with over you know metricizing an any activity you know pretending that you can measure the benefits of everything
POD1000000047_S0000213	academic world of course is a and
POD1000000047_S0000214	real example of that where people start getting obsessed with impact factors and nonsense like that so and there is a real danger with with believing these things too much and also in time
POD1000000047_S0000215	i think we should have a damn good go at trying to do it and just because something is is difficult and cannot be done perfectly does not mean that you can not at least have a have a stab at it because because you may
POD1000000047_S0000217	you know often
POD1000000047_S0000218	these things might can get really clear around things you know the great precision might not be required in order to determine that actually this is not an not an effective use of the sources compared with incidences
POD1000000047_S0000220	yeah and i think that rather than giving us a perfect answer to all questions using you know models and looking at different factors can as you say just help you to identify like clear differences or areas where you need to get more information because you just have no idea how to factor that in all
POD1000000047_S0000221	so i must say it can definitely be very useful finally just to what extent do you think that the average person can benefit from a better understanding of statistics learning more statistics you know either in their everyday lives or in being more effective as altruists
POD1000000047_S0000222	and to what extent do you think i guess relating back to the past question it could potentially limit us
POD1000000047_S0000224	yeah i think i think yeah of course i do of course i would say this would not i but yeah i do believe that people would benefit from having them a greater idea of stats and measurement and number and quantity
POD1000000047_S0000225	and and the frailties of that as well because the point about understanding statistics is both understanding their strength and their weaknesses the 2 are absolutely hand in hand and what people tend to do at the moment they are not you know i suppose not confident
POD1000000047_S0000226	with with with numbers and how they are constructed because they are in their whole are always constructed someone has chosen what to measure and the there is they tend to either accept them as if they are god given truth and that is you know the number and that is so vital
POD1000000047_S0000227	for you and that is it that is what we are looking for or reject them out of hand 0 you can not put numbers
POD1000000047_S0000229	damn lies and statistics and this is nonsense and those 2 extreme views both equally idiotic
POD1000000047_S0000231	but if you have got a slightly more nuanced view you will realize that statistics numbers and measurement are an incredibly valuable tool but they are they are just a tool and they they have their frailties and inadequacies so they both need to be
POD1000000047_S0000233	teach and understand the strength and the limitations and what i mean i am involved in a number of educational projects in in which we are trying to do just that
POD1000000047_S0000235	so it is really a matter of trying to assign the appropriate weight to each different kind of evidence or each different piece of evidence that comes your way
POD1000000047_S0000236	i think i mean in the end what statistics is is to do with its quantitative evidence that is what that is what they want that the talking about and and evidence can be good or bad or you know a long whole scale it is not a true or false
POD1000000047_S0000237	it is just evidence and we are trying to weigh up our evidence and which we do all the time in our lives we do this but you know our guts tend to be bit fallible when it comes to weighing up evidence
POD1000000047_S0000239	too influenced by certain salient things that would attract our attention and so as she is standing back and trying to be a bit cooler about weighing up evidence i think it is a really valuable thing to try to do in all areas of life it does not matter what
POD1000000047_S0000240	yeah absolutely which is not to say that you should completely discount that gut feeling but often just supplement it with some extra evidence source statistics
POD1000000047_S0000241	like my guts
POD1000000047_S0000243	i i do not trust them a bit but i still you know go with them
POD1000000047_S0000244	yeah i think that is about all we have got time for now but thanks so much david this has been very informative really interesting
POD1000000047_S0000245	okay thanks very much
POD1000000047_S0000247	alright if you would like to hear more from professor spiegel halter then you can find his blog at understanding uncertainty online and he is also often on the radio in the u k in particular on more or less on b b c 4
POD1000000048_S0000001	hi i am rob director of research at 80000 hours today i am speaking with miles brundage research fellow at the university of oxford is future of humanity institute
POD1000000048_S0000002	he studies the social implications surrounding the development of new tech technologies and has a particular interest in artificial general intelligence that is an a i system that could do most or all of the tasks humans could do
POD1000000048_S0000003	miles is research has been supported by the national science foundation the bipartisan policy center and the future of life institute thanks for making time to talk to us today miles
POD1000000048_S0000004	thanks for having me
POD1000000048_S0000005	so 1st up maybe just tell us a bit about your background and what questions you are looking into at the moment
POD1000000048_S0000007	sure so i used to work on energy policy when i was living in washington d c and i have gradually moved into a i policy over the past few years because it seems like it is more of a neglected area and could have a very large impact
POD1000000048_S0000008	so i recently started at the future of humanity institute and i am also concurrently finishing up my p h d in human and social dimensions of science and technology at arizona state university
POD1000000048_S0000009	so in both capacities i am interested in what sorts of methods would be useful for thinking about a i in a rigorous way and particularly the uncertainty of possible futures surrounding a i
POD1000000048_S0000010	and i have a few more specific interests such as openness and artificial intelligence and the risks related to bad actors
POD1000000048_S0000011	okay so are you trying to predict what is going to happen and when and what sort of effects it will have
POD1000000048_S0000012	so not necessarily predict per se but at least understand what is plausible i think that it is very difficult to predict with any high confidence what is going to happen and when
POD1000000048_S0000013	but understanding for example what sorts of actions people could carry out with a i systems today or in the foreseeable future in different domains like cyber security
POD1000000048_S0000014	and information operations the production of fake news automatically and autonomous drones and so forth
POD1000000048_S0000015	i think understanding the security landscape of those sorts of things does not necessarily require a very detailed forecast of when exactly something will occur so much as understanding what is technologically possible given near term trends
POD1000000048_S0000017	yeah you do not necessarily have to say this is when the this particular accident or malicious behavior will occur but just that these are the sorts of risks that we need to be prepared for
POD1000000048_S0000018	right right does that bring you into contact with with organizations that are developing a i is like like google
POD1000000048_S0000020	yeah yeah absolutely so those organizations have an interest in making sure that a i is as beneficial as possible
POD1000000048_S0000022	keenly aware of the fact that they can be misused and that there might be accident risks associated with them
POD1000000048_S0000023	so for example i held a workshop fairly recently on the connection between bad actors and a i and what sorts of bad actors we might be concerned about in this space and we had some participation from some of those groups
POD1000000048_S0000024	right right what kinds of bad actors are you thinking of
POD1000000048_S0000025	i think there you can look at it from a number of different perspectives so depending on the domain that you are interested in you might end up with different sorts of actors
POD1000000048_S0000026	so in the case of physical harm associated with a i you might look at autonomous weapons and the weaponization of consumer drones and in that case it is something that would be particularly appealing to state actors as well as terrorists
POD1000000048_S0000027	we are already seeing the weaponization of consumer drones though without much autonomy if any in the case of isis overseas
POD1000000048_S0000028	so there are cases like that where we can foresee that particular groups when given more advanced capabilities such as higher baseline levels of autonomy in consumer drones
POD1000000048_S0000029	would like would would be able to and would like to carry out damage on a larger scale
POD1000000048_S0000030	but in other cases it is less clear for example there are concerns around mass surveillance and it is often not totally clear whether one should be more concerned about states or corporations
POD1000000048_S0000031	depending on what sorts of risk you are concerned about for example corporations currently have a lot of data on people and
POD1000000048_S0000032	there is there have been a lot of concerns raised about the use of a i to make decisions that have critical impacts on people is lives
POD1000000048_S0000033	such as denying loans and in court decisions and so forth that are being informed by often not very transparent algorithms
POD1000000048_S0000034	so those those are some concerns but there is also a potentially different class of concerns around authoritarian states using a i for oppression
POD1000000048_S0000035	so it is i think there is a range of risks but generally speaking there is going to be a study increase in the floor of the skill level as these a i technologies diffuse
POD1000000048_S0000036	that is there will be more and more capabilities available to people at the bottom of the scale that is individuals as well as people with more access to computing power money and data at the higher end
POD1000000048_S0000037	so it is not totally clear how to think about that because on the one hand you might expect that
POD1000000048_S0000038	the the biggest actors are the most concerning because they have the most skill and resources but on the other hand they also are sometimes in the case of democratic governments
POD1000000048_S0000039	held accountable to citizens and in the case of corporations held accountable to stakeholders you might also think that you would be more concerned about individual rogue actors
POD1000000048_S0000040	so that is an issue i am still trying to think through in the in the context of the report that i am writing based on that workshop
POD1000000048_S0000041	right since people often distinguish between the short term risks from a i like self driving cars not working properly or algorithmic bias
POD1000000048_S0000042	and then the longer term concerns of what we are going to do once artificial intelligence is as smart as humans or potentially much much more intelligent which one of those do you spend more time working on
POD1000000048_S0000043	i try to focus on issues that span different time horizons so i think that a i and security is something that we are already seeing some early instances of today
POD1000000048_S0000044	so it is already being used for detection of cyber threats for example and the production of vulnerabilities in software there is a lot of research going on
POD1000000048_S0000045	which an example being the darpa grant cyber cyber grant challenge recently where there is automated hacking and automated defense
POD1000000048_S0000046	so there is already stuff happening on the front of a i and security as well as the economics of a i and so and issues surrounding privacy
POD1000000048_S0000047	but it is it is not totally clear whether the issues in the future will just be straightforward extensions of those or whether there will be qualitatively different
POD1000000048_S0000049	think it is important to think about what is happening today and imagine how it might progressively develop into a more extreme future as well as to think about possible discontinuities when a i progresses more quickly
POD1000000048_S0000050	right right so i should say this point that we have a profile up on our website about the the the potential upsides and downsides of artificial intelligence so we go through all all of the basics
POD1000000048_S0000051	and miles you have a forthcoming guide to work on a i policy and strategy that we are going to link to so here we are going to try to go beyond that if you find yourself a little bit confused then potentially just go on to read one of those one of those documents 1st
POD1000000048_S0000052	so 0 which policy or strategy questions do you see as most important for us to answer in order to ensure that the development of artificial intelligence goes well rather than in a in a bad way
POD1000000048_S0000053	i think there are a lot of questions and some of the ones say was talking about earlier surrounding security and and preventing the weaponization of a i by dangerous actors is one
POD1000000048_S0000054	but one and also other issues that have been widely discussed in the media and by academics such as accountability of algorithms transparency the economic impacts of a i and so forth
POD1000000048_S0000055	but one that i think is particularly important particularly over the long over the long term this is a case where there might be a need to think about possible discontinuities
POD1000000048_S0000056	is coordination surrounding a i safety so there has been a lot of attention called to a i safety in the past few years and there is starting to be a lot of concrete and successful research on the problem of avoiding certain a i safety failure modes
POD1000000048_S0000057	like wire heading and value misalignment and so forth but there has been less attention paid to how do you actually incentivize people to act on the the best practices and the good theoretical frameworks that are developed
POD1000000048_S0000058	assuming that they will be developed and that is a a potentially big problem if there is a competitive situation between companies or between countries or both and there is an incentive to skimp on those safety measures
POD1000000048_S0000059	so there has been a little bit of work for example by armstrong et al at the future of humanity institute looking at arms race type scenarios involving a i where there would be an incentive to skimp
POD1000000048_S0000060	because you are concerned about losing the lead in an a i race and there might be significant we we do not really know what the extent will be
POD1000000048_S0000061	but there it might turn out that there are significant trade offs between safety and performance of a i systems so one might be tempted to in order to gain an advantage whether economic or military or intelligence wise
POD1000000048_S0000062	ramp up the capabilities of an a i system by adding more hardware adding more data adding more sensors and effectors and so forth but that might actually be dangerous if you do not understand the the full behavioral envelope of the system
POD1000000048_S0000063	so to speak and how to constrain actors the human actors from doing that is a very difficult problem
POD1000000048_S0000064	so i have i along with others at the future of humanity institute and other different organizations have started thinking about what is an incentive compatible mechanism to ensure
POD1000000048_S0000065	the people do the right thing in that case that is to say we do not want to ask people to do something that is totally against their interests
POD1000000048_S0000066	if they actually do have an interest in developing these systems and protecting themselves militarily or otherwise but we also want to ensure that they are constrained in some sort of way
POD1000000048_S0000067	so one example would be at a range this is not necessarily for a fully fleshed out example but just to illustrate the sort of thing i am talking about
POD1000000048_S0000068	would be some sort of arrangement between a i developers such that in order to gain access to the latest breakthroughs or the latest computing power
POD1000000048_S0000069	you would need to submit to some sort of safety monitoring and and adhere to certain best practices
POD1000000048_S0000070	that would create an incentive if you want to be on the cutting edge to to participate in those safety protocols so that is again that is not a fully worked out example
POD1000000048_S0000071	that is that is an example of the class of things that i would like to see more of the developing specific proposals for how to ensure that the right thing that is being developed on the technical front actually gets implemented
POD1000000048_S0000072	right do you look much at say what governments should be doing in this area whether there is regulations that we should be putting in place or at least preparing to put in place in future
POD1000000048_S0000073	yeah so i think that that ties in with what i was saying a little bit in that one might envision that as a i capabilities develop
POD1000000048_S0000074	it will be increasingly seen as a matter of national security that a country be on the the leading edge i think it is a it is not super clear how to navigate that yet
POD1000000048_S0000075	i think there is some low hanging fruit clearly in my opinion it would be beneficial for countries to have some experts in house in their governments who actually know something about a i
POD1000000048_S0000076	and are able to deal with crises as they arise if they arise and to be able to think carefully about the impacts of a i on the labor force for example
POD1000000048_S0000077	so i think there is some low hanging fruit and some policies that have been developed for dealing with some of the near term issues but for the longer term issues
POD1000000048_S0000078	it is not super clear that we want to rush into a situation where governments are are leading this if if that would turn out to only accentuate the the arms race dynamics
POD1000000048_S0000079	we should be trying to avoid if a i is seen even more as a national security issue in an unharmed unhelpful way
POD1000000048_S0000080	so i think it is incumbent on those who are thinking about the long term policy issues around a i to develop a more positive proposal that involves not just
POD1000000048_S0000081	you know the u s government getting involved for the purpose of accelerating american a i capabilities
POD1000000048_S0000082	but some more collaborative approach
POD1000000048_S0000083	yeah i suppose with with previous dangerous technologies like like nuclear weapons or chemical or biological weapons there is there has been agreements to try to slow down their development and and deployment is that something that could potentially happen here at the international level
POD1000000048_S0000085	i think it is possible to imagine some sort of slowing down among a small number of actors
POD1000000048_S0000086	awe are fortunate that there is a high concentration of computing power and talent and skill in a fairly small number of organizations
POD1000000048_S0000087	so there is pretty much no chance of some random person out competing you know the top organizations in a i in a surprising way
POD1000000048_S0000088	so it is possible that with with some of the top companies and nonprofits as well countries they could coordinate in some sort of way
POD1000000048_S0000089	not to postpone a i you know across society for a long period of time but at least to be cautious in the later stages of development and to allow time for mutual vetting of of safety procedures and things like that
POD1000000048_S0000090	so i think it is possible to imagine some sort of coordination but the the technical and the political factors interact to a large extent
POD1000000048_S0000091	but to the extent that we actually have good safety measures that are efficient and that do not introduce a lot of overhead computational or otherwise into these systems
POD1000000048_S0000092	then we will be in a better place to actually get people to coordinate because it will not be imposing a lot of costs on them and likewise to the extent that we are able to coordinate better
POD1000000048_S0000093	it will we will be in a better position actually get people to implement this this mechanisms if they do impose some performance penalties
POD1000000048_S0000094	right so so can you think of like any major bits of progress we have made on a i strategy questions over the last couple of years
POD1000000048_S0000095	so the example i mentioned of the paper by armstrong et al called racing to the precipice is one example and it presented sort of a stark version of the arms race scenario
POD1000000048_S0000096	that i think you know there are reasons to be our more optimistic than than are presented in that paper because they look at only a certain in a set of assumptions as with any model
POD1000000048_S0000097	but more generally i think there has been progress in the development of principles and criteria for good policies in recent years so for example with the asilomar conference and the set of asilomar a i principles
POD1000000048_S0000098	so i think that was a good step towards developing some shared understanding around the need to avoid arms races and concerns over a i weaponization and so forth
POD1000000048_S0000099	but it is i i still think that there is a lot of room for
POD1000000048_S0000100	progress to be made so there was a paper put out by the future of humanity institute by nick bostrom carrick flynn and allan defoe recently that looks at policy desiderata for the development of machine superintelligence
POD1000000048_S0000101	and there is a lot of good material there but i think they would be the 1st to admit that we are still at the the the high level principles stage of developing these policies
POD1000000048_S0000102	so we we have a better understanding of what we want to avoid than than we did a few years ago and what sort of what what a good policy proposal would look like
POD1000000048_S0000103	but we do not yet have anything super actionable so i think the situation is a bit analogous to where a i safety was a few years ago
POD1000000048_S0000104	where there were there was starting to be an articulation of what the problem was with the book super intelligence and various other publications
POD1000000048_S0000105	and people were starting to take the problem seriously and started to have a vocabulary for what a what a solution would look like with value alignment and other terms being coined
POD1000000048_S0000106	but there was not yet any you know concrete research agenda and yeah subsequently there have been a lot of concrete research agendas
POD1000000048_S0000107	as well as technical progress on some parts of those research agendas with work by openai and deepmind and others leading the way
POD1000000048_S0000108	so i think that we are potentially in a similarly exciting phase on the a i policy front where we have a a decent understanding of what the problem is and with the example of avoiding arms races being you know forefront in my mind
POD1000000048_S0000109	at least but we do not yet have a concrete we do not have you know clear models and case studies that we can point to as as ways forward
POD1000000048_S0000110	so i think that is the next step is moving into more concrete proposals and trying to balance some of the trade offs that have been identified in recent papers
POD1000000048_S0000112	so it seems like excuse me seems like a lot of the latest thinking in this area is not written up in public yet partly because people do not want to publicize their views at this point or just because it takes a long time to get papers published
POD1000000048_S0000113	what do you think is the best way for someone who is interested in working in the area to get up to speed on the issues
POD1000000048_S0000114	so i think again it is somewhat analogous to the situation with you know a i safety a few years ago and i think the book superintelligence was a big step forward on that front in terms of having a single reference to point people to
POD1000000048_S0000115	but it is less clear if there is one single reference to point people to on a i policy issues though i am hoping hoping that the career guide that i am working on will be somewhat useful in that regard
POD1000000048_S0000116	another resource that comes to mind is a syllabus for a class on the global politics of a i developed by allan dafoe at yield and the future of humanity institute
POD1000000048_S0000117	that that is a very detailed list of resources and i i i am sure there will be a link provided for for this interview somewhere
POD1000000048_S0000118	yeah
POD1000000048_S0000119	and yeah so i i think that is that is another set of resources it is essentially a long list of you know both formal you know academic publications as well as things in the more gray literature
POD1000000048_S0000120	such as blog posts which is you know i think the sort of thing that you are referring to you know as things that are not necessarily written up academically but are you know somewhat accessible but even there there is still some things like you know google docs that are used internally and so forth
POD1000000048_S0000121	so i think if if based on reading those sorts of things this is clearly something you are interested in then the obvious next step is just to get in touch with people who are working on these issues and and ask and you know indicate what your interests are
POD1000000048_S0000122	and there might be things that are not available online that they can point you to
POD1000000048_S0000123	yeah you mentioned the asilomar statement of of principles do you just want to describe that
POD1000000048_S0000124	sure so
POD1000000048_S0000125	2 years ago there was a conference on beneficial a i held in puerto rico and that led to an open an open letter on a i
POD1000000048_S0000126	and subsequently some investment by elon musk in the future of life institute which supported a lot of grants in this space
POD1000000048_S0000127	and i think that that led to a lot of attention to the issue and there were you know 1000s of people by including a lot of a i scientists who signed onto that letter
POD1000000048_S0000128	and then subsequently the asilomar principles which were developed at a conference 2 years later this year at asilomar in california
POD1000000048_S0000129	developed a more specific set of proposals for what sorts of things a i scientists should be thinking about so not just you know the fact that there should be more research but also things like capability caution
POD1000000048_S0000130	so being attentive to the fact that we do not know for sure what the upper limits of a i capabilities will will ultimately be
POD1000000048_S0000131	and the things i mentioned about avoiding arms races and being concerned about a i weaponization more broadly so i think that is a good example of developing you know sort of a consensus view on what
POD1000000048_S0000132	what we want to see and what we do not want to see we want to see a i benefiting society as a whole and we do not want to see it you know leading to the accruing of benefits to a small number of people or to large scale war or anything like that
POD1000000048_S0000133	and i think it is it is encouraging to see not just that but also the development of other sets of principles through the ieee and their effort on ethically aligned a i design
POD1000000048_S0000134	so so i read this this principles and they seem quite strong on paper do you do you think people are likely to follow through on them
POD1000000048_S0000135	i think i think there is somewhat of a gap between the level of abstraction of of the principles and concrete steps that people can take
POD1000000048_S0000136	so for example it is not totally clear what any individual can do to stop an arms race for example but i think it is a step in the right direction to know where where you are headed
POD1000000048_S0000137	and then figuring out exactly what to do about that is is the next step
POD1000000048_S0000138	yeah so in in your guide you suggest that people could potentially work on a i strategy and policy questions at places like google deepmind or openai where where artificial intelligence is actually being developed
POD1000000048_S0000139	what what concretely could you see people doing at places like that if they took a job there
POD1000000048_S0000140	yeah so so some extent people at those organizations are are doing something fairly similar to what i and my colleagues are doing in academia
POD1000000048_S0000141	which is thinking about what the problems are and trying to develop solutions i think the the benefit of being on that side of things is to have more direct exposure to what is happening on the ground so to speak
POD1000000048_S0000142	in a i development and i think that can be useful for developing a set of what sorts of problems are actually cropping up as a result of the development of capabilities that actually exist as opposed to just ones in the future
POD1000000048_S0000143	though i think it is also notable that people at these organizations have been very active in the efforts that i have mentioned such as raising attention to a i safety
POD1000000048_S0000144	which was an initiative that that involved people at google brain and openai and the concrete problems in the a i safety paper
POD1000000048_S0000145	and people at deepmind have been very influential in in calling for more a i safety work and they have been publishing fairly early on this matter relative to other organizations
POD1000000048_S0000146	so i think there is a lot of reason to think that these organizations are are playing a positive role and i think it is it would be a good place to be involved in sort of thought leadership on these topics
POD1000000048_S0000147	as well as doing direct research
POD1000000048_S0000149	and how hard it is to get a job at a place like that
POD1000000048_S0000151	i would imagine they not only have a few people working on a i strategy or policy are these extremely competitive roles
POD1000000048_S0000152	i would say they are pretty competitive and i think that is that is you know a general phenomenon in anything related to a i these days whether on the policy side or the technical side
POD1000000048_S0000153	but i i think that this is a growth area for sure so if if one develops expertise in this topic and has something to contribute
POD1000000048_S0000154	then i think there will ultimately be opportunities available to you in the next few years
POD1000000048_S0000155	it is again i i want to you know draw an analogy to a i safety where there was a lot of concern about will there be jobs in a i safety you know 3 years years ago and i think that deterred some grad students from working in this space and
POD1000000048_S0000156	now the situation seems to look a bit better in that there is a fair number of advertisements for postdocs and people being hired at top top labs to work on these issues
POD1000000048_S0000157	so i think we will probably see something pretty similar not necessarily becoming not competitive but they are being a little bit of slackening over time as as there is a need for developing larger teams to work on these topics
POD1000000048_S0000159	and another path you have talked about is going into politics or policy roles for example as a congressional staffer or perhaps at a think tank like the brookings institute or the national science foundation or potentially just going into party politics in general
POD1000000048_S0000160	what useful things do you envisage people could do there
POD1000000048_S0000162	yeah so i think in the same way that working at an a i lab would give you a better sense of what is practical on the technical front
POD1000000048_S0000163	working for congress or parliament or you know political party would give you a better sense of what is practical on the political front
POD1000000048_S0000164	so in addition to that developing a better intuition for the the system that you are dealing with and what the constraints are
POD1000000048_S0000165	i think it is also potentially a good way to actually influence what what is actually done by those bodies
POD1000000048_S0000166	so for example in the u s congress right now there was just recently announced an a i caucus to organize the discussion of members of congress on issues related to a i
POD1000000048_S0000167	with particular focus on issues related to the future of work but i think over time we will see more discussion of of the longer term sorts of issues
POD1000000048_S0000168	that we have been talking about in in those fora and they would be useful to have people who are concerned about making sure that the right thing is is ultimately done working in those places
POD1000000048_S0000169	and able to actually act on the best the best current understanding developed by researchers and by practitioners
POD1000000048_S0000170	yeah so i think a big risk of going into politics or policy in general would be that your career progresses but you are not specifically in one of the places that ends up having a say in how these things go
POD1000000048_S0000171	you just end up you know being a you know working in a in in a congressional committee that that turns out not to be that relevant are there any roles that that you can take early on or what can you do to position yourself well so that you do not just get sidelined in the end
POD1000000048_S0000173	i think if you intend to work in politics then you have to be somewhat opportunistic about jobs and the ebb and flow of political opportunities so for example
POD1000000048_S0000174	if you know 11 congressional committee is declining in its relevance in in terms of a i then one should consider about you know jumping ship towards somewhere that is more relevant
POD1000000048_S0000175	so i do not think that you know taking one particular job will lock you in forever but building up some political capital and some human capital in that area could be useful
POD1000000048_S0000176	even if you ultimately want to switch to a different organization but i would push back a little bit on the idea of you know not being relevant just because you are not at the undecided of the people
POD1000000048_S0000177	you are not at the at the organization where people are developing the latest a i as i as i mentioned before i think that is a very exciting opportunity and you know along with academia it is it is a great great place to work on these issues
POD1000000048_S0000178	but governments still play an important role in framing these issues and in convening discussions
POD1000000048_S0000179	for example of example of this would be the preparing for the future of artificial intelligence report put out by the white house office of science and technology policy last year
POD1000000048_S0000180	which you know was was the result of 4 workshops that brought together experts in a wide variety of areas in law and economics and a i technology and safety
POD1000000048_S0000181	and so i think you still have an opportunity to frame the discussion and move the ball forward even if you are not working in the latest labs
POD1000000048_S0000182	yeah so what would be some of the best places to apply to in that area
POD1000000048_S0000183	so it is it is a bit tricky to answer that in general it depends on factors like what your citizenship is and what particular policy issues you are interested in
POD1000000048_S0000184	but some fairly robust recommendations would be to look for for for for a particular class of people that have technical backgrounds
POD1000000048_S0000185	one area to look at would be triple a s fellowships so the american association for the advancement of science has a fellowship program
POD1000000048_S0000186	where they essentially put people in rotations in organizations like congress and the executive branch where they can implement some of some they can you know draw on their technical experience
POD1000000048_S0000187	some someone with a background in a i would probably end up in an a i relevant organization so i have heard a lot of good things about that being a good good way to develop career capital and experience and understanding of how the political system works
POD1000000048_S0000188	but that is not necessarily you know going to result in being in the exact right location for for you know solving a i policy problems the next few months
POD1000000048_S0000189	i think it is really hard to say where where that would be or even if there is such a place because i think we are still
POD1000000048_S0000190	despite all the progress that is being made in a relatively early stage so there is not even yet a recommendation there is not even yet a nomination for the director of the office of science and technology policy in the white house
POD1000000048_S0000191	so otherwise i would say that that is a good place to to go so likewise we do not really know what the agenda of the trump administration is on the a i front
POD1000000048_S0000192	and there is a lot of there is a lot of discussion but not much institution building in in governments at the moment so it is hard for me to answer that in general
POD1000000048_S0000193	but i think getting experience is a pretty robust thing to do
POD1000000048_S0000194	right right so situation that i i encounter reasonably often is i meet someone who is really smart who is very interested in this topic who might be able to make a great contribution
POD1000000048_S0000195	but at the moment there are not that many groups that are hiring for these roles you are at the future of humanity institute and i guess there is also the future of life institute but there are not that many places that someone can potentially apply
POD1000000048_S0000196	something what advice should i give someone in that situation should they should they continue studying perhaps or building expertise so that they are in a better position to to apply in the future when the number of positions grows or yeah
POD1000000048_S0000197	yeah i mean again it is hard to answer that in general it depends on what what
POD1000000048_S0000198	background the person has and what what sorts of jobs they are interested in but i think if one casts a fairly large net in terms of what a i issues one wants to work on there there is a fairly fairly large range of organizations
POD1000000048_S0000199	it is not just it is not just f h i there is also the center for the study of existential risk the leverhulme center for the future of intelligence the tech policy lab at the university of washington
POD1000000048_S0000200	and you know various faculty programs around the various academic programs around the country in the u s and around the world are are looking to hire people
POD1000000048_S0000201	for example as postdocs or a faculty member in in areas related to a i and policy if if you are someone with an academic background
POD1000000048_S0000202	and there are probably a fair number of policy positions at tech companies that are not necessarily specific to a i but that would lead to getting valuable experience in the broad area of tech policy
POD1000000048_S0000203	so again to generalize a bit i would recommend casting a fairly large net and working in adjacent areas if you can not immediately work in the exact right place
POD1000000048_S0000204	because this is not some not the sort of area where people have been working on a i policy for decades and it is hard to break in for that reason it is more just that it is still a field that is growing
POD1000000048_S0000205	and i do not think that that growth will stop i think there will be more opportunities in the future but if if you can not find the right opportunity now
POD1000000048_S0000206	then then you know talk to people in the field about what sorts of opportunities are on the horizon and try and work in adjacent fields that might be one thing to consider
POD1000000048_S0000207	yeah so what do you think would be the biggest challenges for someone starting out trying to start a career in this area
POD1000000048_S0000208	depending on one is background i think the main challenge would be boning up on areas of weakness
POD1000000048_S0000209	so for example if you have a policy background you might want to focus on learning more about a i and if you have a technical background you might want to focus more on learning about policy
POD1000000048_S0000210	i i think one of the challenges chalenges is what you mentioned before about there not being a super clearly accessible literature on the topic
POD1000000048_S0000211	and i i think there is some effort being going into addressing that with the career guide and the bibliography that i mentioned
POD1000000048_S0000212	but i am not really sure that there is you know any specific set of pitfalls that i would recommend
POD1000000048_S0000213	people avoid besides you know not you know neglecting the the areas in which they are weak do not do not try and rest on your laurels in say technical areas or policy areas because it is a fairly interdisciplinary area
POD1000000048_S0000214	and you would need to think about what sorts of disciplinary perspectives would be beneficial to solving the problem you are interested in and not just what is your background though of course you want to draw on your strengths
POD1000000048_S0000215	i guess it is a it is a field that is in it is fairly early stages and is is growing quickly
POD1000000048_S0000216	it it would be a good fit for someone who was really able to set their own direction and meet people and potentially attract funding to do what they want to do someone who is going to create the opportunities that they want to go into
POD1000000048_S0000217	yeah absolutely and i yeah it is it is an area that is evolving and i think a lot a lot of the organizations
POD1000000048_S0000218	that exist today and i have mentioned as as you know good places to work and so forth did not exist 5 years ago so yeah
POD1000000048_S0000220	yeah some of them did not exist one year ago so it is it is an area in flux and i think you as with politics
POD1000000048_S0000221	you should be opportunistic think about thinking you know thinking about what what is sort of yeah what what is the right place for you to be in
POD1000000048_S0000222	but yeah i think it is it is a very exciting area to work in and i think that a lot of people will find that you know it is an area that would benefit from their their background
POD1000000048_S0000223	un so if you had someone that could go into any organization or role and that would be a good fit what what kind of person would you think is most valuable out of everything
POD1000000048_S0000225	most valuable person i do not really have an answer for that
POD1000000048_S0000226	you do not have an answer for that
POD1000000048_S0000227	yeah
POD1000000048_S0000228	is there any is there any say vacancy out there that you think you know you just wish that someone someone could fill it
POD1000000048_S0000229	
POD1000000048_S0000231	any 111 vacancy that that comes to mind is for the policy researcher position at deepmind so they are currently hiring for for someone to specifically look at a i policy
POD1000000048_S0000232	so i think the the the case is pretty clear that that would be a good place to work and a good role to have if you are interested in influencing the conversation around a i policy and being exposed to the latest developments
POD1000000048_S0000233	so yeah if you are if you would be a good candidate for that and you are interested in that you should definitely apply
POD1000000048_S0000234	so so sometimes i i find people who want to work on a i policy because they do not see themselves as quite cut out for for technical core research perhaps because their math skills are not quite good enough
POD1000000048_S0000235	is that a sensible way to go or is in some ways the a i strategy work harder just because it is it is less clear it is less precise than than technical work
POD1000000048_S0000236	i would not say it is harder or easier it is just different but even even on the technical side there is there is a lot of fuzziness
POD1000000048_S0000237	so you know a i safety was not very crisply defined a few years ago and it is starting to move more in the direction of technical rigor
POD1000000048_S0000238	and i think the same thing will happen to a i policy to some extent but there will also always be some element of relationship building and and you know qualitative analysis and so forth
POD1000000048_S0000239	that that certainly is is not exactly the same as as solving technical problems so yes i do think that having a different background would it would make sense to choose different areas to work with base based on your background
POD1000000048_S0000240	but i would not say that you know working on the safety problem is totally technical and the policy problem is totally non technical but certainly there is some correlation there
POD1000000048_S0000241	and what kind of level of technical understanding do you have to get to in order to be able to make a useful contribution
POD1000000048_S0000242	i am not sure that you need any specific level in order to make some contribution so for example there are there are a lot of roles that can be played by people who are just you know good at distilling the literature on a particular topic
POD1000000048_S0000243	so for example if you are interested in understanding the role that a i could play in authoritarian states
POD1000000048_S0000244	then you do not necessarily have to have any technical background to read up on the literature around surveillance and coercion and and things like that
POD1000000048_S0000245	so i think there is a lot of room for just good synthesizers and and people who are curious and interested to dip in areas they are unfamiliar with
POD1000000048_S0000246	but i think there is also a fairly high ceiling for you know what would be useful
POD1000000048_S0000247	i think it would also be good to have people with very strong technical backgrounds thinking about the you know the nitty the nitty gritty game theory issues related to arms races and so forth
POD1000000048_S0000248	so i think yeah it is a pretty it is a pretty broad range of possible skill sets that would be useful
POD1000000048_S0000249	right so you are thinking if you can just understand what you can speculate about what an a i might be capable of doing in the future and then if you know economics or if you know social science
POD1000000048_S0000250	then you can think what implications would that have for politics and that kind of thing even if you do not understand specifically how the how the a i would work
POD1000000048_S0000251	yeah ideally you know a little bit about each of those things but you do not need to be an expert in everything it is impossible to be an expert in everything
POD1000000048_S0000252	so you it is not feasible to to learn about every every single discipline of of which i will list several in this policy career guide that that you mentioned
POD1000000048_S0000253	clearly you cannot be an expert you know a deep expert in in technical a i economics sociology political science etc
POD1000000048_S0000254	but knowing a little bit and and being able to collaborate with people with complementary skill sets is also very valuable
POD1000000048_S0000255	so i think a lot of the the most exciting work in the next few years will involve collaboration between people on the technical side and on the policy side
POD1000000048_S0000256	right so so how can someone tell which which kind of paths they are most suited for
POD1000000048_S0000258	i do not think that there is any clear algorithm for this but talking to people in the area and and in reading some of the literature and thinking about where where you think the gaps are
POD1000000048_S0000259	what what areas you think that you can shed light on given your background is definitely something you should do
POD1000000048_S0000260	you should look at what sorts of job opportunities are available and you know cast a fairly broad net you know because you do not necessarily know what what is going to strike your interest until you stumble upon that opportunity
POD1000000048_S0000261	and networking is also super helpful so i think not just in terms of finding out about job opportunities and figuring out where there is a nice fit but also finding out about different organizational cultures and where you might fit in is also useful
POD1000000048_S0000262	so yeah i do not think there is a single algorithm but networking and reading more of the literature and looking at job job postings are all good things to do
POD1000000048_S0000263	yeah what kinds of places can people network are there any events that are open to people who do not yet have roles
POD1000000048_S0000264	yeah so all of the a i conferences are open to anyone who is capable of you know make you know paying for the trip and the the ticket
POD1000000048_S0000265	so so some examples of of big a i a i conferences are nips i c m l
POD1000000048_S0000267	triple a i and so forth
POD1000000048_S0000268	yeah nips you know the biggest you know machine learning conference right now with an emphasis on deep learning i c m l is also a very large one actually i am not sure which one of those is bigger
POD1000000048_S0000269	i have not been to i c m l but i have been to nips a few times i clear i c l r is also a deep learning specific conference
POD1000000048_S0000270	so i think going to conferences like that and specifically going to workshops and symposia that are relevant to policy questions which often happens at these conferences
POD1000000048_S0000271	so for example at nips last year there was there was a symposium on the a i and the law so there
POD1000000048_S0000272	there are opportunities like that to network and find find out more about how people in that area are thinking and to meet people who have similar interests
POD1000000048_S0000273	and you know that is just on the a i side it is also it is also we are thinking about more policy oriented conferences so there is some conferences like the governance of emerging technologies conference
POD1000000048_S0000274	the we robot conference series and probably a few others that would be of interest to people who are you know either on the technical side and want to move in a more thinking about policy side
POD1000000048_S0000275	or just they are in the policy side but they want to you know specifically seek out people interested in a i those those would be good places to look
POD1000000048_S0000276	and are any of the organizations involved open enough that someone who is interested in the area can can drop by and and get to know people
POD1000000048_S0000277	yeah so i think particularly on the academic side though to some extent also at corporations there is a fair amount of openness
POD1000000048_S0000278	and you know for example at f h i we host a lot of visitors who just want to learn more about our work and the same is true of other organizations
POD1000000048_S0000280	yeah so it sounded like in your guide you thought the best undergraduate major was was something like combining a technical subject
POD1000000048_S0000281	like math or computer science with a more social science topic like politics or economics
POD1000000048_S0000282	assuming that post people listening to this have already chosen their major what should people do at the postgraduate level should should they do a p h d or just go and work directly at at google if they can
POD1000000048_S0000284	i
POD1000000048_S0000286	i mean i have i have probably said this a 1000000 times but i do not think there is a clear answer for everyone but
POD1000000048_S0000288	but certainly you know it does not hurt to have an advanced degree of course there are opportunity costs but there there is certainly more job opportunities available for someone who you know has has a p h d
POD1000000048_S0000289	so for example i do not know if it is a hard requirement but certainly it would be a benefit for people applying to a fair number of industry jobs if they had an advanced degree
POD1000000048_S0000290	as well as in academia so it it is hard to avoid the fact that you know for academic jobs as much as yeah we would like to you know hire people solely based on their demonstrated skills
POD1000000048_S0000291	often also the case that there are university policies surrounding you know what sorts of degrees you need for for different roles and pay grades and so
POD1000000048_S0000292	there is definitely value to having a graduate degree despite the you know non trivial opportunity cost if fi you have an opportunity
POD1000000048_S0000293	but you know as with all these things it it depends on someone is background and if you have a clear opportunity to make an impact
POD1000000048_S0000294	and you could you know perhaps get some of the best of both worlds by you know also taking classes online or enrolling at a local university and being a part time p h d student or master is student i think
POD1000000048_S0000295	yeah you should yeah there might be ways to have your cake and eat it too but it would depend on the particular person
POD1000000048_S0000296	yeah and and i guess the most obvious options at the postgraduate level are things like machine learning or computer science or or economics so i guess public policy is that useful
POD1000000048_S0000297	yeah so yeah just to give a particular example at oxford we have a handful of people who are interested in a i safety and a i policy as well as broader issues related to the future
POD1000000048_S0000298	and you know just at the organization that i am at f h i there are people who are either currently enrolled or who soon will be enrolled in programs in mine which is human and social dimensions of science and technology
POD1000000048_S0000299	as well as machine learning cyber security and zoology so there there is a wide range of possible areas that one could study and you know find an advisor that is suitable and interested in supporting yeah interesting work
POD1000000048_S0000301	yeah so so some people worry that doing work in this this in this area could could be harmful if not done well so for example it could be that as you were saying earlier that regulation in this area could could be done poorly and would actually be harmful overall
POD1000000048_S0000302	or that bringing greater attention to the issue could could reinforce the arms race dynamic or tentatively having people get involved who do not have enough technical expertise could could bring the area into disrepute
POD1000000048_S0000303	how seriously do you take those kinds of concerns should should people be cautious about about jumping into the area if if they do not feel like they are really on top of things
POD1000000048_S0000304	i
POD1000000048_S0000306	think that is a reasonable concern and yeah there there is
POD1000000048_S0000307	in fact some some risk of you know discrediting yourself or your cause by by being you know too too alarmist or whatever the particular charge might be
POD1000000048_S0000308	but on the other hand there is a lot of noise in the system no matter what and whatever you whatever you do in the near term there will be terminator pictures and and people who you know dismiss a i safety and all sorts of other things you can not really control
POD1000000048_S0000309	so i i think they are also risks of not acting which is you know not you know not being able to help out when there is an important program and you have something to contribute
POD1000000048_S0000310	so i would say you know if if that is something that concerns you then talk to people about you know your beliefs and what your beliefs are you know
POD1000000048_S0000311	whether there is you know and look at surveys of experts and you know see see how you know what what what the you know reasonable distribution is among people who have studied the topic more
POD1000000048_S0000312	so i do not think it is you know an all or nothing sort of thing where you either have to stay ignorant or be a super expert
POD1000000048_S0000313	i think there is there is a middle ground where you sort of you know develop your confidence little by little as you go and trying remain as modest as possible in areas that you have little expertise
POD1000000048_S0000314	yeah i suppose you could always track the things that you know people like you or nick bostrom are saying and how you speak about the issues so that you so you do not come across as alarmist and you know you you have a measured and precise tone
POD1000000048_S0000315	right right
POD1000000048_S0000316	yeah so so you mentioned earlier that a i could potentially be used in military applications and that is one way that things could go badly given that do you see much value in people going into military or intelligence roles to with with the hope of limiting this in the in the future
POD1000000048_S0000318	possibly it is really hard to say it would depend on the particular role so probably a role you know higher up in the chain and more on the policy and strategy sides of things
POD1000000048_S0000319	as opposed to the more operational or logistical or just execution side of things would be more likely to give you an opportunity to to affect those sorts of things
POD1000000048_S0000320	but there might also be benefits to that beyond just you know having a direct impact on the issue while in that role
POD1000000048_S0000321	you could also then develop valuable connections and know the right people to influence from the outside down the road or have a better understanding of the dynamics of the problem and you know what needs to be done to solve it so
POD1000000048_S0000322	i i definitely would not dismiss it but i also you know would not necessarily recommend it across the board as as the best thing to do
POD1000000048_S0000323	yeah i i guess the intelligence services and military are just such enormous bureaucracies i suppose i would i would worry that someone you like it is just unlikely perhaps that you would be in the right place at the right time or or have enough discretion in those roles to be able to make a difference
POD1000000048_S0000324	but as you say it could could help you to build up your career capital so you can get other other good useful roles in the future and and you know how the system works so you could potentially influence it from outside and talk to the right people
POD1000000048_S0000325	yeah exactly so you know again it would depend on the particular person and what other options they have but it is certainly worth considering
POD1000000048_S0000326	what about what about foreign policy could it be useful to go into department of state or something like that and work on arms control agreements
POD1000000048_S0000327	so you know even just current arms control agreements so you you understand how they work and can think about how they might work for a i in future
POD1000000048_S0000329	yeah so i think that could be very useful looking at arms control and foreign policy you know both from an academic perspective and from a practitioner perspective i think it is very valuable
POD1000000048_S0000330	and it is something that were not that is not our strong suit in the a i safety and policy community right now
POD1000000048_S0000331	so more more could be done on that front but i i think some of the same caveats apply to the the as to the military and intelligence side of things that the state department for example is a very large bureaucracy
POD1000000048_S0000332	yeah and how do you feel about just more general attempts to to make the world better such that when a i is developed things are more likely to go well
POD1000000048_S0000333	for example just improving the you know quality of government in general trying to get get the right kinds of people elected or improving our ability to forecast the future across the board
POD1000000048_S0000335	is is i guess one worry would be that that is just not sufficiently leveraged on on this specific problem and if you think a i is really likely to be the key issue then you want to work on that specifically
POD1000000048_S0000336	but maybe if you could improve our ability to forecast technological changes in the future across the board then that could be a better option and also you just have a lot more options if you are if you are open to broader ways of improving the world
POD1000000048_S0000337	yeah i i do not think there is a clear decision for everyone but it it both at the you know group level and at the individual level it often makes sense to take a sum it up a portfolio approach
POD1000000048_S0000338	so there are people at f h i who also are affiliated with the center for effective altruism and involved in building the e a community like owen cotton barratt and toby ord
POD1000000048_S0000339	so there are people who straddle that boundary and and you know look for opportunities to benefit both sides and there are also people you know who focus on one thing or the others
POD1000000048_S0000340	so i do not think there is a clear right answer but certainly the the sorts of trade offs you mention sound reasonable on the one hand one would want the world to be in a better place
POD1000000048_S0000341	for there to be more people who are thinking carefully about making making good decisions and benefiting future people in in various important decision making roles
POD1000000048_S0000342	but there it it is quite uncertain you know what what impact you could have on a i and likewise even even if you work directly on a i it is not totally clear that that is always the best thing you should do
POD1000000048_S0000343	but you know i have a slighty you know bias towards thinking that work that direct work is is you know needs more attention at the moment but i think you know that you should take that with a grain of salt
POD1000000048_S0000344	because you know i would like more people to help solve the specific problems i am working on
POD1000000048_S0000345	so so we should potentially continue trying to get people involved we will just become a i researchers right away
POD1000000048_S0000346	right
POD1000000048_S0000347	so so that is that is all of my questions was there anything you wanted to add
POD1000000048_S0000348	any inspiring message
POD1000000048_S0000349	yeah i mean i will just circle back on what i was saying earlier which is that a i safety was in a very nebulous stage of development a few years ago
POD1000000048_S0000350	and it took the work of nick bostrom in superintelligence and stuart russell in giving a lot of talks and writing op eds to call more attention to it and give it more legitimacy
POD1000000048_S0000351	and then subsequent work was done to refine the issue and develop research agendas by by people including the authors of he concrete problems in a i safety paper
POD1000000048_S0000352	and now we have a lot of postdocs and graduate students working specifically on this we have people in industry specifically working on well defined problems in this space
POD1000000048_S0000353	and we have the opportunity to make a similar transition in a i policy over the next few years
POD1000000048_S0000354	to removing from fairly high level desiderata and and problem framings to specific proposals and you know formal models and you know good white papers
POD1000000048_S0000355	and so forth over the next few years and it is it is an area that would benefit from a lot of people is expertise so i would definitely encourage people to who you know think they might have some relevant expertise to seriously consider
POD1000000048_S0000356	yeah i will just reiterate that since i wrote our problem profile on positively shaping artificial development we have heard from a lot of people who think that this is the most neglected area within within the a i safety
POD1000000048_S0000357	and i am i am very keen to get more people working on these on these problems and getting more organizations hiring for them so if if it is something that you are interested in
POD1000000048_S0000358	i think you should you should definitely be be looking into it more and and we will put up links to to guides where you can find out more and and meet the right people
POD1000000048_S0000360	yeah thanks so much and have a great day and look forward to talking in future
POD1000000048_S0000361	all right thanks bye
YOU1000000000_S0000000	in this week is episode we drive the new ford ranger we answer questions about e v is and driving in cold weather
YOU1000000000_S0000001	and also answer the question what we do with the cars once we done testing them next on talking cars
YOU1000000000_S0000003	hi and welcome back i am mike quinzi
YOU1000000000_S0000005	so we like to give a little behind the scenes look at what goes on here at consumer parts auto test track
YOU1000000000_S0000006	we talk to people who are die hard enthusiast as well as people that look upon cars as merely appliances
YOU1000000000_S0000007	and we find that they are absolutely shocked when they find out that we buy every test car
YOU1000000000_S0000008	that we put through our test program and that for testing purposes we drive in different car every night
YOU1000000000_S0000009	so to take us through the process ryan how you decide what do you drive every night
YOU1000000000_S0000010	well before that we you know the routine we buy we buy all these cars anonymously
YOU1000000000_S0000011	we bring them back here we check them in we have a wall of keys and it is like a fantasy land right
YOU1000000000_S0000012	and we get to pick these cars every night almost every single night we drive a different car that is pretty ridiculous right
YOU1000000000_S0000013	so there is this the wall keys we pick what we going to drive
YOU1000000000_S0000014	and some of these cars you know if it is a brand new car it is has a priority we have to give it up to mile to get to 50000 miles before we can test it
YOU1000000000_S0000015	and there is people that are riding 1st drives or the engineers that people that have a direct influence on you know the early testing
YOU1000000000_S0000016	have to get these cars you know 1st
YOU1000000000_S0000017	if video producers that get on us for doing a 1st drive video
YOU1000000000_S0000018	always bothering us to do more
YOU1000000000_S0000019	so you you know the there is there there is some some sort of i i want to call a packing order but
YOU1000000000_S0000020	you know there is there is price people need to get these cars right and we all you understand that
YOU1000000000_S0000021	and you know make way for that so once we are once we are done testing them
YOU1000000000_S0000022	they go to another wall and that wall that is the huge wall yeah this wall has is all like the retirees right
YOU1000000000_S0000024	but this is this is where it gets interesting because this is where it gets interesting the other
YOU1000000000_S0000025	because the 1st keyboard is cars they have to all get miles we are driving them irregardless right when it moves to the other board now it is it is selective
YOU1000000000_S0000026	and that is when you get to see the favorites
YOU1000000000_S0000027	right yeah you could see the cars that people really actually like and the cars that you know after testing feel like
YOU1000000000_S0000028	no i am i am not going to drive that anymore
YOU1000000000_S0000029	yeah it is it is so it is kind of interesting because so you know some of these cars is it liked the winter auto start
YOU1000000000_S0000030	heated seats and and when it is clear winters s u v is i mean i i go up to vermont and do stuff i always have an s u v
YOU1000000000_S0000031	something with auto drive
YOU1000000000_S0000032	yeah i will drive you you you know you went to both you got trailers to to tell us something that is all
YOU1000000000_S0000033	and that that brings us you know around to the to the spring time which we are hoping for that comes anytime soon
YOU1000000000_S0000034	but but the most frequently asked question that i know i get asked probably you guys too
YOU1000000000_S0000035	is what you do with the cars once you done testing them
YOU1000000000_S0000036	so you know we we sell the cars when we are done so the 1st thing we do is a a company wide email goes out
YOU1000000000_S0000037	to let all the employs know you know what cars we are currently selling what the what the selling price how many miles are on them
YOU1000000000_S0000038	and the cars that are not sold to employs then they typically go the auction
YOU1000000000_S0000039	we sell them there and then we take that money to buy more test cars and usually these cars have anywhere from 6 to 12000 miles on them when we are done testing
YOU1000000000_S0000040	some have more we keep some longer than others like let us say it has maybe some advance safety features that we want to do more testing with
YOU1000000000_S0000041	or maybe there is a direct competitor of this car coming soon we want to keep this current car in our test fleet
YOU1000000000_S0000042	so that we have some really good back to back comparisons
YOU1000000000_S0000043	and so considering what we have on hand right now so mike what what kind of a a go to car that you find yourself signing out reason
YOU1000000000_S0000044	so i actually have a few go to cars i mean one of them is the hyundai veloster turbo now
YOU1000000000_S0000045	the only one we have the manual
YOU1000000000_S0000046	the only car we currently have with the manual transmission you know it is it is it has really great hand lane really nice 6 speed manual shifter
YOU1000000000_S0000047	i actually do not go to a quiet as much right now because it is you know quiet cold to have summer tires summer tires do not work as well in the winter
YOU1000000000_S0000048	but you know when it is a warmish day i will take it and it just kinda goes to show how important a manual transmission is
YOU1000000000_S0000049	cuz i actually do not even really love that car you know it is it is rides pretty stiff
YOU1000000000_S0000050	and it is sound like as tons of power and it is front wheel drive i am not a fan of front wheel drive performance cars you know
YOU1000000000_S0000051	but it shows how much i love driving manual transmission i would drive that car any chance i get
YOU1000000000_S0000052	but other cars that i go to genesis g 70 it is like nicer kia stinger you know i love that
YOU1000000000_S0000053	car b m w x 5 i mean it is it is a fantastic s u v it is just great in every way smooth comfortable nice powertrain
YOU1000000000_S0000054	5 does not get cold
YOU1000000000_S0000055	it is that is will be it yeah the keys are never available and then they ran 1500 because that is it is my favorite pickup truck i love pickup trucks
YOU1000000000_S0000056	it is so capable yet drives almost like a almost like a car and it has great sound of v 8
YOU1000000000_S0000057	so those were those my go to
YOU1000000000_S0000058	so ryan when you can choose what would you what do you find in
YOU1000000000_S0000059	it is it is i guess is that earlier to winter i have been in north a bunch i use the x 5 a lot
YOU1000000000_S0000060	i like the silverado you know like the way you have mentioned the velostor like
YOU1000000000_S0000061	i do not fit in that well it is fun to drive but there is just time that i am like it is just frustrating that i do not fit in that well
YOU1000000000_S0000062	i find myself i as a as i have mentioned before i i got through s u v fatigue
YOU1000000000_S0000063	i just sometimes get tired of i miss cars and i i find myself signing out the nissan altima
YOU1000000000_S0000064	over and over it has got heated seats it has got a decent ride and it is android auto so i have got i have got i have got a map
YOU1000000000_S0000065	i have got my music it is just an easy car to live with i mean it definitely has it is faults as we found in our testing
YOU1000000000_S0000066	but i i just i just can i am comfortable in my car i do not know i do not know what how else to put it
YOU1000000000_S0000067	and no one is fighting you for the keys
YOU1000000000_S0000068	and no one is fighting me for the keys
YOU1000000000_S0000069	but so but but like you guys i mean i am i am gravitating toward pick up trucks all the time you know these are test vehicles
YOU1000000000_S0000070	we we take them to home depot we go to the garden centers we we use them to to work all the time
YOU1000000000_S0000071	and and i also i am i am with you on the ram and the silverado both great trucks
YOU1000000000_S0000072	which kind of brings us to our next topic of what we are driving this week at the track
YOU1000000000_S0000073	and so since clearly pickup trucks are big these days we have our new 2019 ford ranger
YOU1000000000_S0000074	this was hotly anticipated by those of us that that love pick up so mike if you could give us a you know quick rundown of of the ranger and how it got here
YOU1000000000_S0000075	yeah so the ranger were was 1st sold in the u s and in 1982 and was sold here until the 2011 model year
YOU1000000000_S0000076	and sales were strong you know for for a while when when that pickup was 1st 1st came out but like in the mid 2000 sales started going down
YOU1000000000_S0000077	pretty dramatically and so you know that was a joint project the ranger between mazda they had the b serious pickup
YOU1000000000_S0000078	that was basically you know almost identical to the ranger
YOU1000000000_S0000079	so ford mazda look at it and it was like you know well you know is it worth with sales going down so much is it worth you know investing the money and
YOU1000000000_S0000080	to want to you know what totally redesign the truck as by 2011 that thing was really old it was an aging truck
YOU1000000000_S0000081	and so they decided the you know to did not you know have the truck here anymore
YOU1000000000_S0000082	and then you know the marker was basically this compact or mid size pickup segment you know largely dominated by a toyota tacoma has been for a long time
YOU1000000000_S0000083	but the nissan frontier kept in there but those you know the tacoma especially quiet an old design as well
YOU1000000000_S0000084	than chevy with their colorado and g m c with the twin the canyon
YOU1000000000_S0000085	you know redesign their pickups and i think ford looked at it like okay hold it we still we have a ranger that is sold in other markets
YOU1000000000_S0000086	this and you know the ridgeline was redesign came back was redesign jeep gladiators is coming out
YOU1000000000_S0000087	i think they said we got to get back in this market because pickups are still hot in this country
YOU1000000000_S0000088	and so they they have this existing design sold up elsewhere
YOU1000000000_S0000089	they have brought it back here and that is what we are now it is 2019 ford ranger
YOU1000000000_S0000090	and not everyone needs you know 1500 half ton pickup truck i mean
YOU1000000000_S0000091	i mean i need a i mean i need a 3500 dually that is that is just me that is just me
YOU1000000000_S0000092	another short joke they have running birds the this is what this is i have a hard time with this segment because this truck the the ranger we have was about $40000
YOU1000000000_S0000094	you can get a full size truck for a little more money and i personally i think it is crazy because i do not fit in these trucks as well
YOU1000000000_S0000095	and there it is it is half it is half the truck i mean it does not make sense to me for that kinda money if you are if you are space space conscious you want a smaller vehicle it makes some sense but beyond that
YOU1000000000_S0000096	and and and i post it on consume reports facebook page a picture of of the new ranger
YOU1000000000_S0000097	and we spent $40000 and almost every comment was $40000
YOU1000000000_S0000098	it is a lot of money for that
YOU1000000000_S0000099	so you know we we try to out fit the trucks a certain way you know we all cars we try to out fit the way we think most people are going to the way the trucks are going to be sold so that is why right now that truck is 40000
YOU1000000000_S0000101	a current full size trucks or right now and then up and about 50000 so for 10000 more you are going to it have a really nice full size truck not a tripper
YOU1000000000_S0000102	that is what i mean either way i drove it i drove it last night and i i i was pleased actually
YOU1000000000_S0000103	because i i went into it of like the decoma i do not care for the decoma the decoma is great but it does not i do not fit in that well
YOU1000000000_S0000104	it does not excite me when i drive it i am just the colorado is the same thing i fit in that better this thing i actually fit in quiet well the seating position in nice i can see
YOU1000000000_S0000105	my great the the power train it has got a full cylinder eco boost
YOU1000000000_S0000107	yeah and it is has point of power but it is not smooth there is there is some sort of a drive line vibration i feel i am not going to halphen that too much cause it might be this thing needs to break in a little more 400000 mile
YOU1000000000_S0000108	400000 miles we can drive it that far
YOU1000000000_S0000109	broke our record from 4 miles on it
YOU1000000000_S0000110	it is only got 400 miles on it roughly and things are going to break keep you know settling and breaking
YOU1000000000_S0000111	we have noticed that things like transmissions change over out breaking theory like sometimes quiet of and gets smoother
YOU1000000000_S0000112	and and you know the transmission it was a couple goofy shifts and you know these things yeah these things get ironed out but i mean
YOU1000000000_S0000113	it has got it has got plenty of power i was i was happy with that the the the tacoma feels under power to me even the colorado feels under power to me
YOU1000000000_S0000114	this thing on the highway i noticed quiet a bit of wind noise from the door seals and you know just a yeah the seals i guess
YOU1000000000_S0000116	and other than that it has got
YOU1000000000_S0000117	i am with you in a lot ways i was actually really looking forward to this truck so in some ways i was a little more let down
YOU1000000000_S0000118	because i i have really to think we need a really good i think we the market needs a really good compact gear pickup
YOU1000000000_S0000119	it looks apart no question about it and it is a real truck unlike the honda ridgeline which is really just a glorified you know s u v yeah basically a car
YOU1000000000_S0000120	this is a real truck the biggest great for me is the ride it has one of the stiffest bounciest rides i think of any pickup on the market right now
YOU1000000000_S0000121	you think it is worst than the dicoma
YOU1000000000_S0000122	i am not saying it is worse i am saying it is
YOU1000000000_S0000123	i do not think i think it ride fair than dicoma
YOU1000000000_S0000124	i i think interesting
YOU1000000000_S0000125	i am i am with ryan on this actually i i it is not a smooth ride
YOU1000000000_S0000127	so if you if you you know if you are pick a person you are going to put up with that i had it for a weekend and i drove put a lot of miles on it
YOU1000000000_S0000128	and i was fine with it but it is definitely noticeably bouncy and rough a road just trucky no question about it
YOU1000000000_S0000129	so i have that is probably my big describe is that it is you know if you someone who buys a ridgeline this is this is completely different completely different
YOU1000000000_S0000130	you can not even compare those 2
YOU1000000000_S0000131	but people do that is the problem and we do i mean we compare
YOU1000000000_S0000132	big fan of a ridgeline it drives it drives really nicely but the thing
YOU1000000000_S0000133	yeah the pilot i mean it of course it rides well but
YOU1000000000_S0000134	you know i agree with you on on the drive train though it is to me it sounds wheezy
YOU1000000000_S0000135	it is it is sound wheezy yet it has got good powers and then also keep in mind it has a 10 speed automatic transmission
YOU1000000000_S0000136	it is pretty impressive you know and and and i found in general it shifts pretty smoothly it is no breaking in
YOU1000000000_S0000137	but those are couple of times where i would you know be exiting a low speed turn and there was you know a little delay on figuring out which gear i wanted to be in
YOU1000000000_S0000138	you know like i i was other then that i think it is a little silly i do not like the 5 foot bed i
YOU1000000000_S0000139	and you can not get if you want the crew ford crew cab like what we have you can only get the 5 foot bed
YOU1000000000_S0000140	so the way the ranger works is if you get the smaller you know extra cab or whatever you you get the 6 foot bed
YOU1000000000_S0000141	if you get there 4 or 2 cab it is only the 5 of bed so you do not have a those are your choices there is no bed choice
YOU1000000000_S0000142	where as to say chevrolet colorado you can get the longer bed with the with the the bigger cab
YOU1000000000_S0000143	so and the other things like just like the running boards are just placed awkwardly there is no grabbing aboard to get in you want to pick up that is sits that high
YOU1000000000_S0000144	it should be a grabbing luis it is kinda tall i noticed too
YOU1000000000_S0000145	just one more thing on handling i thought was interesting is this thing feels like a miniature f 150
YOU1000000000_S0000146	it got this that dull slow kind of steering it kinda just dead
YOU1000000000_S0000147	and then when you yeah and when you turn it actually has body role like it kinda dives a little bit
YOU1000000000_S0000148	which into that kind of that tricky feel i do not think it is makes the end of the world but it is it was interesting to me that it it reacted kinda like that because colorado is nothing like a silverado
YOU1000000000_S0000149	right right in my eyes but
YOU1000000000_S0000150	so you know keep keep the check and back from consumer report
YOU1000000000_S0000151	still fresh we have this is just our early impressions
YOU1000000000_S0000152	we are going to have more information pretty soon we are going to have a 1st drive in a video which takes us to our next section of questions
YOU1000000000_S0000153	please send us your video and text questions to talking cars and icloud dot com
YOU1000000000_S0000154	1st up is a video question about the toyota rav 4 hybrid and let us take a listen
YOU1000000000_S0000155	hello c r team i and my husband are expecting baby in june and we are in the market to buy our 1st car in next month or so
YOU1000000000_S0000156	i have a question about about 2019 radford hybrid or wheel ride system
YOU1000000000_S0000157	i have learned that the rear is disconnected from the front and the rear wheels get power from the auxiliary battery which get charged when brakes are applied
YOU1000000000_S0000158	does this mean that on a snowy highway when we need all wheel all wheel drive constantly
YOU1000000000_S0000159	when we are driving this car at a steady pace without using too much brakes then i am turning into risk of depleting the battery
YOU1000000000_S0000160	and soon the car turning into just front wheel drive what is reliability battery getting discharged completely considering we have a lot of snow in north east canada
YOU1000000000_S0000161	and sometimes we may need all the wheel drive for for long period of 6 to 7 hours and if it is a big problem then should we disregard radford hybrid
YOU1000000000_S0000162	and look for alternate hybrid like rouge hybrid
YOU1000000000_S0000163	wow what what a great question and clearly shows that talking cars listeners and viewers are very very smart and highly educated
YOU1000000000_S0000164	she knows what she is talking about here yeah so the the new rav 4 hybrid is actually going to have the same hybrid system that they been they have been using this hybrid system since the 1st highlander hybrid
YOU1000000000_S0000165	and i remember this distinctly because i can remember being in a snowstorm watching a highlander hybrid brand new car stuck front wheel drive looked like it was front wheel drive trying to climb a hill
YOU1000000000_S0000166	and this is because the this car has a a gasoline engine and it is front it is technically a front wheel drive car and the hybrid system is a completely separate unit in the rear
YOU1000000000_S0000167	batteries electric motors separately controlled at the rear now
YOU1000000000_S0000168	in in theory they they say this thing you know when you take off it is going to give you power you know
YOU1000000000_S0000169	that the real wheel this senses slip and then going to help you go over time though you can drain that battery down
YOU1000000000_S0000170	and you are left with a potentially a front drive vehicle
YOU1000000000_S0000171	right i mean and just to do a contrast as oppose to a traditional
YOU1000000000_S0000172	all wheel drive it will drive it just have a big drive chevrolet right where you can lock everything up
YOU1000000000_S0000173	exactly and it is it is a neat it is a neat idea but i mean i have seen this thing struggle
YOU1000000000_S0000174	and this this green technology the brand new 2019 rav 4 is going to have this same the system in it
YOU1000000000_S0000175	so for her she really weighing heavily on having all wheel drive that i would not use this as a you know substitute for that
YOU1000000000_S0000176	at the same time you you you do not need all wheel drive all the time even in the snow
YOU1000000000_S0000177	if if if you know sounds like she is mostly concerned about being you know highway drives in snow
YOU1000000000_S0000178	well you know hopefully she has ford ford snow tires cause that is actually the most important thing if if she drives them in a lot of snow
YOU1000000000_S0000179	she should have ford snow tires and then even if it was only front wheel drive she in most cases still be fine and keep in mind this system was designed to be in front drive
YOU1000000000_S0000180	as much as possible for efficiency so therefore it is only for the most part it is only going to switch to to all wheel drive
YOU1000000000_S0000181	when it like you said it is senses slip so a lot of the time even in snow she is going to be driving down the highway
YOU1000000000_S0000182	it is going to want to be in front wheel drive any way until it senses that slip so but but even then really the more important thing
YOU1000000000_S0000183	is is snow tires but unless she is you know she is might notice a problem on you know steep up hills
YOU1000000000_S0000184	on the highway or even more so on back roads is really where this going to potentially be a problem
YOU1000000000_S0000185	if that battery work if she were to be unlucky the the battery is drained when she is trying to go up a steep slippery up
YOU1000000000_S0000186	and having having a new a new kid in i mean maybe i will i will be nervous to tell her that this is good idea
YOU1000000000_S0000187	so you could say well you know so she is thinking about another hybrid you know the nissan rogue hybrid
YOU1000000000_S0000188	but the promise with a lot of these hybrids they are going to work you know they they yeah they become all wheel drive in same similar way
YOU1000000000_S0000189	so maybe a hybrid is all wheel drive is not her best choice
YOU1000000000_S0000190	an alternative that we talked about is is you know one of consumer reports top rated vehicles the scimber forester
YOU1000000000_S0000191	which you do not have to worry about the all wheel drive system kind of you know saying bye bye
YOU1000000000_S0000192	when and you you using it a lot so
YOU1000000000_S0000193	it is not going to be as efficient but it is still quiet efficient
YOU1000000000_S0000195	the efficiency or do you want the safety of being stuck
YOU1000000000_S0000196	now she has no more worries about you know about the auto drive system not being there when she needs it
YOU1000000000_S0000197	thanks your question very still you clearly know your cars and now we are going to move onto the next one which is getting a used ez and winter driving
YOU1000000000_S0000198	the question reads i live in new hampshire and looking to get an e v car i am looking at a used b m w i 3
YOU1000000000_S0000199	a used tesla model s or new model 3 of all wheel drive
YOU1000000000_S0000200	how does an e v rear wheel drive handle the snow with snow tires of course thank you c r for teaching me about snow tires
YOU1000000000_S0000201	i normally think best to worse all wheel drive front wheel drive
YOU1000000000_S0000202	rear and rear wheel drive with internal combustion engine cars where would an e v rear wheel drive fit into that lineup
YOU1000000000_S0000203	so ryan tire man tell us pros and cons
YOU1000000000_S0000204	this is this is a an interesting question because
YOU1000000000_S0000206	it is not easy answer the 1st thing that comes to mind is his he says that he lives in new hampshire
YOU1000000000_S0000207	it is cold there you know my 1st my my 1st reservation would be having electric car in a cold climate
YOU1000000000_S0000208	right cause it would drive you nuts you lose a lot of range right the batteries worst kind of musical
YOU1000000000_S0000209	we did a story on this recently
YOU1000000000_S0000210	1st issue but going back to what he is saying i am 100% you have have snow tires a rear wheel drive car is going to
YOU1000000000_S0000211	the rear wheel drive electric car because you have electric motors they have regenerative braking
YOU1000000000_S0000212	my concern would be when you lift of the throttle will you have to get used to it when you lift of the throttle it is going to be it is essentially dragging at the rear end you are creating a room
YOU1000000000_S0000213	which is a weird feeling on a dry surface
YOU1000000000_S0000214	dry road right and now if it is a slippery surface excuse me they diver they going to they are going to be dragging and if it is really slippery the stability control the cars can do a lot of work
YOU1000000000_S0000215	now you are not going to get spin out of control we have you know modern stability control is very good specially in these cars but
YOU1000000000_S0000216	is it going to go in the snow absolutely i think there is going to be some learning curve there like driving it smoothly and not dealing with all the you know the the the stability control going crazy
YOU1000000000_S0000217	he is right i mean all rear wheel car is probably your best bet with snow tires of course
YOU1000000000_S0000218	when it come to front rear drive it is preference i mean i drove a b m w for years with suzan bag and snow tires and i went anywhere i needed to go
YOU1000000000_S0000219	but i preferred that for the average driver maybe front wheel drives a little bit better with snow tires that is preference
YOU1000000000_S0000220	i i think front wheel drive is easier to control for most drivers because you do not have to worry about power power on oversteer like you do with the wheel drive car rear wheel drive car is definitely more fun
YOU1000000000_S0000221	but what i do not like about front wheel drive cars is you are asking you know the the front wheels to do 2 thing both power and drive the cars
YOU1000000000_S0000222	you know power the car forwards and also steer the car and that is what i like about
YOU1000000000_S0000223	you know a rear wheel drive cars but i think the bigger question is why does this person want you know is there a specific reason he is looking for a rear wheel drive
YOU1000000000_S0000224	and if that is the case if that is the case then then you know if you want the rear drive because you find that more fun to drive then go for
YOU1000000000_S0000225	but you know you know you could go with a little newer tesla
YOU1000000000_S0000226	and you know and get all wheel drive so that is another option
YOU1000000000_S0000227	but the the most the interesting thing about these electric cars though is i i looked up the weight distribution and it is actually not bad
YOU1000000000_S0000228	i mean so for instance the i 3 is 55% of the weight is to the rear this this is you know our our testing
YOU1000000000_S0000229	the model s rear drive was 53% to the rear model 352%
YOU1000000000_S0000230	so we put our skill the point is there is some weight back there you know a lot of cars are in a lot of rear wheel drive cars in 5050
YOU1000000000_S0000231	so you have got a little bit more weight over the rear to give you some traction but the most important thing is with snow tires and a b s
YOU1000000000_S0000232	traction control and electronic still stability control you are going to be fine even with rear wheel drive
YOU1000000000_S0000233	right i i was going to make the argue the front wheel drive the weight is over the drive wheel
YOU1000000000_S0000234	so in slippery conditions that is that is usually gets complicated
YOU1000000000_S0000235	if that is the because because the weight transfer goes rear were
YOU1000000000_S0000236	thanks so much for your question kinda brings us to our final one and unfortunately we got to rap this up the question reads
YOU1000000000_S0000237	love your show i drive a 2018 accord e x l and love all the drivers system
YOU1000000000_S0000238	i drove the car in light snow and after 10 minutes i got a message on the screen that the radar is obstructed
YOU1000000000_S0000239	meaning no driver assist that you are probably seeing on your screen right now what can one conclude from that about self driving cars in the winter
YOU1000000000_S0000241	exactly our concern all of this technology that is why self driving cars are not here yet
YOU1000000000_S0000242	one of the real sensors sensors is a broad term there is there is all different types of sensors there is optical there is you know eyesight there is sonar there is all kind of sensors
YOU1000000000_S0000243	if they are clogged up or there is something in the way they are not going to work well and if you are relaying on that to save your life you are crazy
YOU1000000000_S0000244	this is the this is the week spa on this technology it is not perfect and he did not drive far and it was already not working this is this is a major concern
YOU1000000000_S0000245	yeah what we recently did a story on consumer reports dot org called how to keep your cars safety sensors clean
YOU1000000000_S0000246	when snowing ice attack so the reality is that you know the you know there is radar sensors on the front of a lot of new cars
YOU1000000000_S0000247	it have you know 4 closure morning automatic automatic emergency breaking usually in the grill quiet often in the the emblem you know the emblems have gotten quiet huge these days
YOU1000000000_S0000248	and so they have those radar sensors in there and so what can happen is snow ice salt can you know get all grimed up on there
YOU1000000000_S0000249	and so when that happens the system is going to shut down because it knows it can not see what it needs to see anymore
YOU1000000000_S0000250	and it will give you warning on your your dashboard that this has happened but now you know for closure warning automatic braking not going to work anymore so you can no longer rely on
YOU1000000000_S0000251	it is a little bit regional because if we you know we in a snow belt it is going to be a bigger issue but still sand and dust and mud and southern state is eventually the same is going to do the same thing you have to keep these things clean
YOU1000000000_S0000252	and you also need to you know and keep in mind there is sensors all around your cars these days you know you know for blind spot warning and things like that
YOU1000000000_S0000253	and and your your rear view camera you know there is a little lens back there that you you know even in a rain
YOU1000000000_S0000254	it it or you know if you if you have been driving in rain and you put you know the car in reverse it is very blurry back there because it is it is all has has you know water all over
YOU1000000000_S0000255	so it is important to keep these sensors clean if you are driving on it you know snowy trip or whatever and it gives you that warning
YOU1000000000_S0000256	you know pull over the next next rest area that you can and clean clean off the front grill
YOU1000000000_S0000257	and we actually did a i believe we did a video on this with john stockberger that is online right producer dave can people can check that video out
YOU1000000000_S0000258	so check out that video because jen tells you she shows you where all the sensors are on the cars and how to clean them
YOU1000000000_S0000259	but the more important thing is where they are and also your owners manual will tell you where all the sensors are on your specific car and that is very important to know that
YOU1000000000_S0000260	when you get this warning that hey these things are not working right in the moment we need to know where they are so you can you can clean them
YOU1000000000_S0000261	well this can do it for this episode you want to learn more about the topics and the cars that we talked about check out the show notes and keep those questions coming in talking cars at icloud dot com
YOU1000000000_S0000262	thanks so much for tuning in we will see you next week
YOU1000000002_S0000000	this video was made possible by curiosity stream when you sign up at the link in the description you also get access to nebula the streaming video platform that winodover is a part of
YOU1000000002_S0000001	the wuhan coronavirus began like all new viruses with a remarkably ordinary moment
YOU1000000002_S0000002	in late november 2019 someone it is not yet known who ate a wild animal that by chance carried the novel coronavirus
YOU1000000002_S0000003	and days later started to feel the symptoms of what initially seemed like a bad cold
YOU1000000002_S0000004	from there more individuals were infected at 1st through the consumption of other wild animals but later through direct human to human transmission
YOU1000000002_S0000005	for the entire month of december the virus was there in wuhan spreading but nobody knew it
YOU1000000002_S0000006	the cases presenting as pneumonia were at 1st considered to be caused by anyone of the countless other viruses that can create such symptoms
YOU1000000002_S0000007	eventually the escalation in cases and effect that almost all the 1st patients had bought food at one particular wild animal market caught the wuhan city government is attention
YOU1000000002_S0000008	the 1st official confirmation that something was up came on new year is eve
YOU1000000002_S0000009	december 31st when the municipal health commission published a press release acknowledging the situation
YOU1000000002_S0000010	over a month after the 1st transmission at the time this was small local news
YOU1000000002_S0000011	only a few dozen cases of pneumonia in a city of 1000000s in a country of a 1000000000
YOU1000000002_S0000012	but then came the news that this was not one of the many pre existing pneumonia causing viruses
YOU1000000002_S0000013	this was something new western media 1st reported on the novel coronavirus around january 8th
YOU1000000002_S0000014	the new york times forebodingly wrote there is no evidence that the new virus is readily spread by humans and it has not been tied to any deaths
YOU1000000002_S0000015	that would soon change
YOU1000000002_S0000016	on january 21st when the world health organization started tracking the outbreak there were 282 cases
YOU1000000002_S0000017	the next day 314 the next 581
YOU1000000002_S0000018	then 846 then 1320
YOU1000000002_S0000019	then 2014 and by the start of the week of january 26th it was clear that this would not be a quick and painless virus
YOU1000000002_S0000020	this would be one for the history books and it was going to get a lot worse before it got any better
YOU1000000002_S0000021	drastic circumstances called for drastic action it was clear given the trends that wuhan is hospitals would soon be overwhelmed by patients
YOU1000000002_S0000022	and in the case of highly infectious viruses like coronavirus that makes a bad situation worse as infected individuals will try to recover at home
YOU1000000002_S0000023	where the virus can more easily spread therefore the decision was made on january 23rd to build a brand new facility capable of treating 1000 patients at once
YOU1000000002_S0000024	huoshenshan hospital it was announced that this would be done fully constructed by february 2nd
YOU1000000002_S0000025	just 10 days later
YOU1000000002_S0000026	china has experienced with such a feat in 2003 the country suffered an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome or sars which is also caused by a form of coronavirus
YOU1000000002_S0000027	much like with the novel coronavirus hospitals were overwhelmed and many had to turn away patients
YOU1000000002_S0000028	in response the government decided to build a new hospital
YOU1000000002_S0000029	over 6 days 7000 construction workers brought the xiaotangshan hospital into reality and it quickly began accepting patients and relieving the overstressed medical system
YOU1000000002_S0000030	once the outbreak settled down the xiaotangshan hospital was hailed as a massive success by both the country itself and the world health organization
YOU1000000002_S0000031	the statistics speak for themselves overall sars had a fatality rate of 9.6%
YOU1000000002_S0000032	at the xiaotangshan hospital just one.2% of patients died
YOU1000000002_S0000033	and not a single staff member was infected
YOU1000000002_S0000034	it is no wonder why china wanted to replicate this
YOU1000000002_S0000035	and therefore xiaotangshan was the model for the new coronavirus hospital but this time would be different
YOU1000000002_S0000036	the 2003 hospital began construction over 6 months after the beginning of the outbreak
YOU1000000002_S0000037	the 2020 hospital started construction less than 2 months after the 1st case and just days after the seriousness of the outbreak became clear
YOU1000000002_S0000038	there was far less time for planning and design the orders came and then it was immediately time to start
YOU1000000002_S0000039	step one was finding a place to put the hospital
YOU1000000002_S0000040	the location selected was previously just an open field about 14 miles or 22 kilometers from central wuhan
YOU1000000002_S0000041	this kept it away from the dense urban core where further transmission might be easier but the field in question was also right off a large pre existing road which made access easy
YOU1000000002_S0000042	that road was quickly shut down and turned into essentially a parking lot and staging area for the project
YOU1000000002_S0000043	the contract for this project was given to china construction 3rd engineering bureau company a subsidiary of the state owned china state construction engineering corporation
YOU1000000002_S0000044	by revenue this is the world is largest construction company and it has experience in enormous projects like beijing is new airport egypt is new capital city and tesla shanghai giga factory
YOU1000000002_S0000045	if anyone was going to pull this off it was them
YOU1000000002_S0000046	to begin construction in earnest they 1st needed to prepare the selected site
YOU1000000002_S0000047	that involved 1st cutting down all the trees and shrubbery and then perfectly leveling the ground
YOU1000000002_S0000048	out of the 10 day construction timeline this took longer than one might think
YOU1000000002_S0000049	about 48 hours
YOU1000000002_S0000050	this was due in part to the fact that the project was significantly understaffed in its 1st few days
YOU1000000002_S0000051	as they scrambled to find workers especially as it is start coincided with the chinese new years
YOU1000000002_S0000052	once the land was level though they moved on to constructing the building foundations by sunday january 26th
YOU1000000002_S0000053	for this they used a layered system
YOU1000000002_S0000054	on the bottom at 8 inch or 20 centimeter layer of sand was placed then what is referred to as a geotextile layer
YOU1000000002_S0000055	a formal fabric then a layer of waterproof plastic then another of geotextile layer then another layer of sand
YOU1000000002_S0000056	on that they then poured concrete which dried over a few days
YOU1000000002_S0000057	but then came the truly impressive element
YOU1000000002_S0000058	constructing the buildings themselves in a matter of days
YOU1000000002_S0000059	what made this possible was the use of pre fabricated elements
YOU1000000002_S0000060	modular construction such as this has been on the rise recently
YOU1000000002_S0000061	it is now a well establish technique for the construction of buildings large and small
YOU1000000002_S0000062	the idea is simply that somewhere offsite in number of identical building elements are built
YOU1000000002_S0000063	then they are shipped to the construction site and put together
YOU1000000002_S0000064	this has plenty of advantages
YOU1000000002_S0000065	1st and foremost the use of identical elements built in a factory system to construct a larger building lowers cost through economies of scale
YOU1000000002_S0000066	then when you actually get to putting the building together on site construction time is significantly less
YOU1000000002_S0000067	which once again lowers cost
YOU1000000002_S0000068	in this case though cost was not the primary concern
YOU1000000002_S0000069	speed was and modular construction is the fastest way to build
YOU1000000002_S0000070	most of these site used a type of prefabricated modular construction common with temporary buildings
YOU1000000002_S0000071	while it is not clear which company produce the prefabricated components it is clear that they existed before the project started
YOU1000000002_S0000072	the 1st building elements started coming together on monday january 27th just 4 days after the project broke grounds
YOU1000000002_S0000073	they began by building the skeleton on the modular units
YOU1000000002_S0000074	each of these units was about the shape and size of a 20 foot shipping container
YOU1000000002_S0000075	and this skeleton form included just the floor ceiling and structural supports at each corner
YOU1000000002_S0000076	throughout this all separate teams out of the 1000s of workers there started to hook the site up to utilities like sewage water electricity and internet
YOU1000000002_S0000077	much of this just involved bringing in the state owned companies responsible for these but for internet and the subsequent building out of an it system private companies like huawei and lenovo got involved
YOU1000000002_S0000078	this was no doubt partially because the construction of this hospital drew considerable public attention in china
YOU1000000002_S0000079	it came to represent the physical manifestation of the country is response to the crisis and also of china is engineering might
YOU1000000002_S0000080	the construction process itself was streamed by state owned broadcasting companies and up to 18000000 concurrent viewers watched the process
YOU1000000002_S0000081	nearly every major broadcaster in china reporting from the site publishing footage like what you are seeing now although very few western broadcasters were there
YOU1000000002_S0000082	this is part of the reason limited detailed information and footage of the construction exists outside of china state owned broadcasts
YOU1000000002_S0000083	where the government can manage the story and what gets out
YOU1000000002_S0000084	it was no doubt viewed as an opportunity by the chinese government in a time when they faced intense criticism for its initial response to the outbreak
YOU1000000002_S0000085	but of course to gain that praise the project needed to be successful
YOU1000000002_S0000086	on tuesday january 28th significant portions of the 1st building were completed while the rest of the complexes foundations were finishing up
YOU1000000002_S0000087	over the 20 ninth and 30th more of the overall structure came to be as the walls were installed on and in the skeletons of buildings and work then began on turning these empty buildings into a hospital
YOU1000000002_S0000088	each patient room was outfitted with 2 beds some medical equipment and a bathroom
YOU1000000002_S0000089	considering the hospital is built with quarantine in mind there are some unique aspects to the design of these rooms
YOU1000000002_S0000090	for one the ventilation system is built to keep a negative pressure in all quarantine areas so that air will go out through an exhaust system rather than out under the door into the rest of the hospital
YOU1000000002_S0000091	while at the time of writing it is not entirely known to what extent this coronavirus can spread through airborne transmission a ventilation system like this is standard practice for any quarantine ward
YOU1000000002_S0000092	in addition to individual patient rooms separate areas were designed for patient processing diagnostic tools like c t scanners were installed and other crucial aspects like offices breakrooms and canteens were built in
YOU1000000002_S0000093	over the 31st of january and 1st and 2nd of february the final areas of the complex were built up the interior installation was wrapped up and all the systems were tested to ensure that the hospital was ready to bring in patients
YOU1000000002_S0000094	meanwhile 8 people is liberation army transport planes landed at wuhan airport carrying the military medical staff who would staff the hospital
YOU1000000002_S0000095	they moved into the facility throughout the same day february 2nd then throughout the night workers put the finishing touches onto the 100s of rooms
YOU1000000002_S0000096	then the next morning the moment that 10 days prior seemed impossible arrived
YOU1000000002_S0000097	the 1st patients transferred from other facilities were wheeled into huoshenshan hospital and thus marked the beginning of its operations
YOU1000000002_S0000098	they started with just a few dozen patients but in a matter of days this ballooned to 100s
YOU1000000002_S0000099	huoshenshan hospital was only the start of china is plan to ramp up the number of available beds in wuhan
YOU1000000002_S0000100	just 3 days after huoshenshan is opening another even larger hospital called leishenshan opened
YOU1000000002_S0000101	it is 1600 beds and 32 wards were built in just 12 days
YOU1000000002_S0000102	meanwhile other hospitals were converted to isolate and treat coronavirus patients and stadiums and exhibition centers were turned into hospitals as well
YOU1000000002_S0000103	still though even with this swift decisive action reports indicate that many of those with milder cases of coronavirus are getting turned away from hospitals in wuhan
YOU1000000002_S0000104	it unfortunately seems that coronavirus with its tremendous severity is one of the few things that can outpace china
YOU1000000002_S0000105	if you want to learn more about how viruses such as this work from a biological perspective curiosity stream has a fascinating short documentary on one previous epidemic
YOU1000000002_S0000106	the zika virus

YOU1000000004_S0000001	hey everyone thanks for tuning in to another wordpress wednesday today wraps up our series that we have done on social media and plugins
YOU1000000004_S0000002	how to use a hashtag all things kinda social media having to do with wordpress specifically we have looked a lot of different options for facebook instagram twitter youtube pinterest all sorts of different network
YOU1000000004_S0000003	so if you have missed all those be sure to check those out i will put some links in the description box below so you can check those out and get some ideas
YOU1000000004_S0000004	for how to be using those social networks to improve your branding reach and even to just improve the experience that your users have on these networks
YOU1000000004_S0000005	alright so today i want to talk about how to get your your post in wordpress automatically published at least at facebook
YOU1000000004_S0000006	i have got a couple of other options that you will be able to get your post published across the board to a ton of different networks all at once
YOU1000000004_S0000007	but i 1st want to start off by showing you a free option because if you watch my channel you know that free is always in the budget right
YOU1000000004_S0000008	so we want to look at and i am just going to show you on here 12nd this again is how to get your
YOU1000000004_S0000010	blog post as soon as you click publish on a blog post we want it to automatically connect over to your facebook page
YOU1000000004_S0000011	and kind of do an extra little blurp over there and maybe also include your featured image over there and then of course put a link to get people to come back to your website
YOU1000000004_S0000012	now if you are only interested in using this for one network you know facebook is probably the obvious choice there it is not too much of a time saver
YOU1000000004_S0000013	but if you are really trying to connect across multiple networks this could really be a time saver for you
YOU1000000004_S0000014	of course if you are running on the dot com version of wordpress you probably know about jetpack inside of jetpack you have an option for something like this called publicize
YOU1000000004_S0000015	so take a look at that one that is available inside of jetpack if you have not wanted to use this because of just the heaviness the weight of what jetpack is on your website
YOU1000000004_S0000016	there is another option so let us do this we are of course in our dashboard we are in the add new area and i want to do a search for
YOU1000000004_S0000018	access press facebook is what we are going to do search for so you can see that right here access press facebook
YOU1000000004_S0000019	and this is the option that comes up that we are looking for this is access press is the developers name of this particular plug in
YOU1000000004_S0000020	i am not making money off of advertising this i am just showing you solution that i have found in the free range now it only has 99000 installs it is relatively new
YOU1000000004_S0000021	it has been updated a day ago so that is great we know that that this author cares to keep this plug in secure for us and then of course it says here it is compatible with our version of wordpress
YOU1000000004_S0000022	so you always want to check that if this is later on down the road that you are viewing this video please be sure before you click install on this that it is up to date
YOU1000000004_S0000023	that it is at least been updated with in the last 6 months that it is still compatible with your version and that it still has great reviews and a lot of active installs so you just go and click on install
YOU1000000004_S0000025	and because i am on w p engine with my hosting they of course give you a quick learn to say hey are you sure that you want to do this before you do an backup
YOU1000000004_S0000026	and i normally just go for it living on the edge people living on the edge
YOU1000000004_S0000027	once you activate it you install it and you activate it down here on the left side of your dashboard now you have an access point to get in here and run through the settings
YOU1000000004_S0000028	now all that was pretty simple straight forward this this installing any plug in
YOU1000000004_S0000029	here is where it gets a little bit more nerd code style okay wrap your brain around this do not get intimidated by this because all it is is simple instruction
YOU1000000004_S0000030	we follow the instruction click through and we are able to basically build what we call an a p i or a bridge between your social media network facebook and your website
YOU1000000004_S0000031	so we have got to connect the 2 and give them in a sense permission to connect and that is what are about to do here
YOU1000000004_S0000032	so step by step instructions of course it since it is not right now since we have not done it yet you need to go ahead and authorize your account to to connect with each other
YOU1000000004_S0000033	and you are going to be looking to copy and pasting some things here now this gives us clear instruction
YOU1000000004_S0000034	please visit here and create a new facebook application to get application i d and application secret so we are going to click here and i have already got a few created
YOU1000000004_S0000035	all you do is click the screen button that says add new and of course i am already logged in to my facebook account and we want to connect it with a website

YOU1000000004_S0000043	so if that is kinda too fast the other cool thing that is in this plugin
YOU1000000004_S0000044	is check this out you have got an option right here how to use and they have got a quick tutorial video that is probably little more advanced than mine
YOU1000000004_S0000045	and they are going to really help you understand how to set all this up just take a moment and read through this i know we do not always like to read we like to watch videos
YOU1000000004_S0000046	but take a moment and read through these instructions this developer really wants to hold your hand and get you successfully publishing
YOU1000000004_S0000047	here is the other this really cool author will do is if you are looking to publish across a bunch of networks all at once they do have a pro version of this

YOU1000000004_S0000051	if you are looking to go just big and you say you know what kori i am using 10 different networks and i really need a time saver and and i do not always like having to go over to something like hootsuite
YOU1000000004_S0000052	and still set everything up i really do want that one magic button that as soon as i click it it blast out across the board i will give you one more
YOU1000000004_S0000053	this is a premium plug in and i will give you one more option here it is called next scripts
YOU1000000004_S0000054	now for free they allow you to use one network so if if you are looking to do just instagram or if you are just looking to do just twitter or just facebook this allows you one free
YOU1000000004_S0000055	but the 2nd you want to do more than that it is going to immediately ask that you buy the pro version and i think right now it is on sell for like 50 u s dollars per year

YOU1000000004_S0000061	and then you are often running i hope this has helped you if you have used any of these tools or you have another one in mind that you have used
YOU1000000004_S0000062	would you put it in the description box or in the comment below so that we can all kinda share our knowledge and grow out wordpress community
YOU1000000004_S0000063	i hope you are having a great one i will see next week for another wordpress wednesday bye you all
YOU1000000006_S0000000	so you are looking to generate real estate leads for your business well i want to show you guys one of the top performing facebook ads that we have used with 1000s of real estate agents
YOU1000000006_S0000001	to help them generate a consistent flow of real estate leads for their business and if you guys want this facebook ad copy this template
YOU1000000006_S0000002	just go ahead drop a comment just say real estate leads down in the comment section and i will be able to share this template with you a 100% free so you can just copy and paste this into your business
YOU1000000006_S0000003	so just go ahead drop a comment real estate leads down in the comment section and give this video a thumbs up now let me just walk you through this template
YOU1000000006_S0000004	and then i want to show you guys how to get this all setup in just a couple of quicks as well for your business so you know how to actually implement this
YOU1000000006_S0000005	so this is a facebook ad to market a new listing and the same thing works on instagram
YOU1000000006_S0000006	because facebook owns instagram so when you setup a facebook ad you are also actually setting up an instagram ad so that is pretty cool because you can spend $10 per day
YOU1000000006_S0000007	and you do not have to spend $10 per day on facebook and $10 per day on instagram you spend $10 per day and it is spilt evenly between both platforms so you are getting the most exposure
YOU1000000006_S0000008	for your real estate business all right so right here we have got this your facebook page so this is the demo page i am using obviously but you are going to be using it from your page
YOU1000000006_S0000009	so let us say jason wardrop and you want to have a profile picture of yourself because a big part of social media is personal branding
YOU1000000006_S0000010	so you want to branding yourself you want to brand your business but you want to have it from your personal facebook business page so now moving down into the actual facebook ad copy
YOU1000000006_S0000011	i like to have some emojis because it kind of pops out at people they stop and they check out what is going on and then also when you do the hashtag it makes it all blue and so once again that kind of pops out of people
YOU1000000006_S0000012	and then we got see it before anyone else 5 bedrooms and normally i would put like how many bats as well right here but go here to get the prize location plus more pictures
YOU1000000006_S0000013	so when you are generating leads what you want to do is you want to hold back some information or make something enticing enough for somebody to give you their contact information so their names phone number email address
YOU1000000006_S0000014	so you can actually follow up with them and connect with them to help them out with whatever they are looking to do so buy or sell a home right
YOU1000000006_S0000015	and so what we are going to do is we are going to kinda give a quick little run down about this home but we are going to hold back enough that we are not going to give them all the in formation so their their interest is peaked
YOU1000000006_S0000016	and then we can actually go through and generate a lead so we have got this 1st call to action here and this is sending them to a landing page
YOU1000000006_S0000017	okay so i will show you what that looks right here okay and we are not sending them to our website or our blog okay when you send them to a website or blog they are not optimized for conversions
YOU1000000006_S0000018	landing pages are and so that is why we want to send them specifically to a landing page okay and then the next couple of paragraphs what we are going to have right here
YOU1000000006_S0000019	is a couple of paragraphs talking about the features of the home okay things that people are going to or like find interesting are they vaulted ceilings is there a pool in the backyard

YOU1000000006_S0000021	and then last but not least i would like to wrap it up with a call to action to the landing page as well okay so right here we have got an image of the exterior of the home
YOU1000000006_S0000022	i like to have a one forward facing image and then if you want this is optional you do not have to but you can add more images of the interior but do not give them all the images
YOU1000000006_S0000023	because you want to hold some of the images back so it gives them a reason to actually go through an opt in so now what we are going to do is we are going to set this up
YOU1000000006_S0000024	so that we are showing this to people in your specific community and then when they are scrolling through their facebook ins or instagram news feed on their mobile phone or on their desktop whatever it is

YOU1000000008_S0000005	facebook live is an awesome tool for growing and engaging an audience with some very simple tips and some very quick pre live stream preparation you can easily get professional results
YOU1000000008_S0000006	so we are going to run through 7 steps to help you do just that
YOU1000000008_S0000007	but as we are going through do not get too excited with any one specific tip and jump off and try to implement it straight away
YOU1000000008_S0000008	we are giving you a process here with tips along the way that you can implement for you next livestream
YOU1000000008_S0000009	and i am also going to share my number one tool for getting more viewers on your shining new professional looking facebook livestream
YOU1000000008_S0000010	and while we are going through make sure you let us know in the comments what your number one tip is for maximizing results when going live on facebook
YOU1000000008_S0000011	alright so 1st off before you go live there is a few things you need to do number one is to plan your content
YOU1000000008_S0000012	so what you want for that is a simple structure of everything that you are going to cover well everything you want to cover in you livestream
YOU1000000008_S0000013	so your structure will have things like a hook which is before the introduction this is the thing that hooks your viewer to stick around for your live
YOU1000000008_S0000014	you also then want an introduction to talk about the things that you are going to cover in the video then you can jump in to the actual content itself
YOU1000000008_S0000015	after you have delivered the content make sure to have a recap or a summary to summarize everything that you have given them
YOU1000000008_S0000016	and then a call to action which is the next step that you want your viewers to take after your facebook live has finished
YOU1000000008_S0000017	such a really simple structure not just for your facebook lives but also for your videos as well number 2 is to pick a location
YOU1000000008_S0000018	now you want to pick a location that matches your videos that you are actually creating you want somewhere that is quite somewhere that is out of the way
YOU1000000008_S0000019	you do not want to be getting distracted or interrupted while you are actually live
YOU1000000008_S0000020	we have all seen that video where the little kid walks in during a livestream
YOU1000000008_S0000021	you do not want that to happen for you so try and pick somewhere out of the way somewhere that is quite with as little environmental variables as possible
YOU1000000008_S0000022	so that is things like light changing outside or clouds coming over trucks or planes making a heap of noise
YOU1000000008_S0000023	you want to try and pick somewhere nice and quite where you can just focus on delivering the content
YOU1000000008_S0000024	you also want to make sure that you are not picking a location that is distracting for your viewers you want your viewers to focus on you and the content you are delivering and not being distracted with what is going on behind you
YOU1000000008_S0000025	step number 3 is to test your internet before you go live it is a really good idea to at least have an understanding of how good or how bad your internet is
YOU1000000008_S0000026	so if you head over to speed test dot net or you can download the app for your iphone or for your android device and run a speed test for the internet connection that you are connected to
YOU1000000008_S0000027	the most important thing that you are looking for here is that number one that the internet you have got is stable and that that little speed test is not bouncing around all over the place
YOU1000000008_S0000028	but also you want to focus on your upload speed too yeah upload speed is what is important here not so much your download speed
YOU1000000008_S0000029	and you want to make sure that ideally you have got at least 2 to 2.5 megabits per 2nd upload
YOU1000000008_S0000030	if you have got 2 to 2.5 megabits per 2nd upload then that will be enough for facebook live but you do need to be aware of other people that are sharing the same internet connection
YOU1000000008_S0000031	if you are on an office wi fi or work connection other people may start downloading files and kill the internet for you
YOU1000000008_S0000032	so you want to run a few tests not just one run a few ideally 15 to 20 minutes before then a few minutes out as well
YOU1000000008_S0000033	so then you can really get an understanding of where your internet speed is at now if your internet speed is less than 2 to 2.5 megabits per 2nd then you have got 2 options
YOU1000000008_S0000034	you can either try to find a different connection or a different location or to use l t e instead of wifi or use your mobile data
YOU1000000008_S0000035	or you could still go live with the connection that you have but just be aware that you might have some issues
YOU1000000008_S0000036	and what do we do in that circumstances if i am going to go live and i know that the internet speed is not 100%
YOU1000000008_S0000037	then one of the very 1st things i would do when i am live is to let my viewers know that we maybe experiencing problem
YOU1000000008_S0000038	because you are not sure how good the internet is in that location so at least that expectation has been met in case there is any issues with your stream
YOU1000000008_S0000039	then obviously then if you are running your speed test and you have got higher than 2.5 megabits per 2nd upload then you should not have any issues at all
YOU1000000008_S0000040	step number 4 is to get everything set up so this means setting up your camera setting up your tripod if you are going to be using the tripod
YOU1000000008_S0000041	make sure everything is stable everything is at the correct height that you have got your audio and your light and everything set up ready to go for your facebook livestream
YOU1000000008_S0000042	now obviously this is going to depend if you are using a camera if you are using your phone or if you are just using your laptop and a web cam to go live
YOU1000000008_S0000043	and there is obviously different recommended gear for the different scenarios
YOU1000000008_S0000044	but i will link up in the card now to some of that recommended gear for going live on facebook live from your smartphone
YOU1000000008_S0000045	simple things like having a portable microphone and a mini tri pod so that you are getting the phone out of your hands
YOU1000000008_S0000046	and into a stable position and that is really important no matter what type of video or live you are creating get your phone or your camera out of your hands and get it somewhere stable
YOU1000000008_S0000047	use a tripod if you can or just position your camera somewhere where it is not going to shake and move around a lot for your lives
YOU1000000008_S0000048	now if you are using a mac or a p c to go live you can use similar gear as well and you can either just use your facebook browser to go live
YOU1000000008_S0000049	or you can use software like e cam or exploit v mix 0 b s wirecast there is a heap of options out there for facebook live
YOU1000000008_S0000050	we are shooting another video that we have just released and i will link that up in the cards as well covering off a heap of different options for going live on facebook
YOU1000000008_S0000051	but no matter which way you are going live the important thing is to make sure that everything is set up correctly and how you want it with as much or as little gear as you have before you go live
YOU1000000008_S0000052	you do not want to be tweaking and changing things while you are live and that leads us right into step number 5 which is to do a test broadcast
YOU1000000008_S0000053	so this is where once you have got everything sorted press the live button but make sure that the live broadcast is only going to just you that it is a private live
YOU1000000008_S0000054	so in the facebook settings you get to choose who you want to broadcast to and there is an option there to broadcast to only me or just yourself
YOU1000000008_S0000055	so that way there is no one else that will see it so what you are looking for in this test is that everything looks good sounds good that everything is set up the way that you would like it
YOU1000000008_S0000056	now if you are going live in a sales scenario or you are doing this for a live promotion
YOU1000000008_S0000057	now it also suggest that while you are running this live that you do a quick run through of the content you are going to be presenting as well
YOU1000000008_S0000058	so that way you will feel more relaxed cuz you have had a run through but also when you are watching back you can give yourself some feedback on how you went in your live test
YOU1000000008_S0000059	step number 6 is to tell people that you are about to go live now this could be as simple as sending out some tweets or some instagram posts or facebook to let people know
YOU1000000008_S0000060	but there is also a really cool way to automatically post and e mail as soon as you go live with a cool app called live leap so i am going to cover that off in a few minutes
YOU1000000008_S0000061	but there are some ways to automate that process as well and step number 7 is to go live so the 1st thing you do when you go live should be to deliver the hook
YOU1000000008_S0000062	start talking to people as if you are delivering the content and the video structure that you had planned out do not stop to welcome everybody in and start some idle chit chat with people
YOU1000000008_S0000063	because that will not fly for the people that are watching the replay they are going to loose that connection with you so focus on the hook and then get straight into the content beyond that
YOU1000000008_S0000064	while you are live you also want to make sure that you are making eye contact directly with your viewers which means looking at the camera lens
YOU1000000008_S0000065	not looking off to the side your viewers would be out of notice if you are not looking or talking directly to them
YOU1000000008_S0000066	so you want to make sure that you are looking directly down your camera lens so you are making that eye contact and that deep connection with your viewers
YOU1000000008_S0000067	now it is likely that while you are live you also want to interact with your audience
YOU1000000008_S0000068	but it is really important here to try and batch all your live interactions into certain areas of your livestream
YOU1000000008_S0000069	you definitely do not want to break the content that you are delivering or the key teachings and learnings for your viewers with you
YOU1000000008_S0000070	dropping off and saying hi to someone as they come in or answering a comment immediately so for some livestreams it could be that you break every few minutes throughout
YOU1000000008_S0000071	or in some cases you might want to save it all until the end of your video to do some interacting or some live q and a
YOU1000000008_S0000072	however you decide to do it make sure you let your viewers know how it is going to work and when you are going to be answering their questions and when you are going to be covering off the content as well
YOU1000000008_S0000073	and also be aware of anything that changes audio wise in your livestream as well
YOU1000000008_S0000074	so if you are filming outside and a big truck pulled up next to you then you might be able to pick up and move to another location while you are still live and presenting and interacting
YOU1000000008_S0000075	so that your viewers can actually still hear what you are saying instead of having it drowned out by a truck or some other noise
YOU1000000008_S0000076	and the last thing to remember while you are live is to have fun with your livestream
YOU1000000008_S0000077	if you are not having fun then it is going to be very difficult for your viewers to engage with you and have fun as well so it all comes down to you have fun with your livestreams and your viewers will enjoy it too
YOU1000000008_S0000078	now i did mention live leap a few minutes ago
YOU1000000008_S0000079	so what live leap is is it is this amazing tool that let us you automatically share out your facebook lives the instant that you go live on facebook live
YOU1000000008_S0000080	and it will let you share them out to your website and let you share them out through e mail through social media and to multiple facebook pages and facebook groups as well
YOU1000000008_S0000081	so an amazing tool to automate all of that so you just need to focus on pressing the go live button instead of sitting there sharing everything at the moment that you go live
YOU1000000008_S0000082	one of the biggest things that i hate to watch on a facebook live is you join you are the 1st one to join or you you know you join immediately when the facebook live happens

YOU1000000012_S0000004	now there is a lot of facebook live software options available out there and we have reviewed a bunch of them individually in the past we have also played around with a lot of other ones as well
YOU1000000012_S0000005	the landscape though is always changing with constant updates so in this video we put all the major players head to head comparing the pros and cons
YOU1000000012_S0000006	to help you decide which is the best for your facebook live streams so whether it is multi person interviews live screen sharing or onscreen chat
YOU1000000012_S0000007	or just fancy branding or animations 3rd party facebook live software can unlock a huge range of functionality that you just can not get with facebook standard apps
YOU1000000012_S0000008	so in this video we are going to tap on my top solutions for the most popular types of facebook live streams including 2 person more than 2 person
YOU1000000012_S0000009	and live with screen sharing capabilities and make sure you stick around to the end because i am also going to give you my number one tip for automatically sharing your facebook live links
YOU1000000012_S0000010	to get more of your audience on to your live streams the moment you go live so these are in no particular order and they rang in price from free to $695
YOU1000000012_S0000011	what is best for you will depend on what you are you looking to achieve the platforms and devices you are using and your budget so make sure you stick around to hear the full 6
YOU1000000012_S0000012	so that you do not miss out so straight off the bat the 1st one that we need to mention is the facebook website
YOU1000000012_S0000013	the easiest way to go live in a lot of cases is just to use the facebook website with your webcam choose to create a new post and click live
YOU1000000012_S0000014	and then you are broadcasting live directly from your laptop or computer with just your webcam so it is probably the easiest way to go live
YOU1000000012_S0000015	from your desktop without the need for any other software or platform so the biggest advantage with this is that you do not need anything else you are not paying for any subscriptions
YOU1000000012_S0000016	you have literally got got all that you need in the facebook website and with a recent update you can now share your computer screen on your facebook lives just using the facebook website as well
YOU1000000012_S0000017	so the biggest disadvantage is then that you do not have any advanced controls so you do not have the ability to bring anyone else in or to really do anything fancy with your live streaming on facebook
YOU1000000012_S0000018	option number 2 is to use live broadcasting or live streaming software like 0 b s or open broadcaster software and wirecast studio
YOU1000000012_S0000019	now both of these are fairly complexed solutions these will give you a professional range of tools for creating professional looking live streams
YOU1000000012_S0000020	things like being able to bring in multiple camera angles and seamlessly switch between them to have multiple screen shares
YOU1000000012_S0000021	to really have a full range of control and customizability over your live streams we have done a full comparison of 0 b s and comparing it to wirecast
YOU1000000012_S0000022	and i will link that up in the cards now if you are interested in that but one of the major differences between the 2 is the price 0 b s which runs on mac pc and linux is free 100% free
YOU1000000012_S0000023	wirecast studio on the other hand which runs on both mac and pc currently sells for $695 which just actually had a decent price increase from $495
YOU1000000012_S0000024	the biggest difference though between the 2 is the level of control and customizability and also the ease of use
YOU1000000012_S0000025	wirecast at that price point is much much easier to set up and use and it is actually one of my go to solutions for professional live streams
YOU1000000012_S0000026	it is what we use for all our client projects in the latest update though from wirecast where they got their price increase as well
YOU1000000012_S0000027	they have actually announced a really decent feature a really cool feature which lets you bring in guests to interview them live seamlessly using the wirecast software
YOU1000000012_S0000028	so it would be similar to bringing someone in on a skype call so that you can bring someone in and interview them and go live through wirecast as well
YOU1000000012_S0000029	now you can do a similar sort of thing with 0 b s and bring in guests using applications like skype and screen sharing that skype call but it can get pretty complicated and pretty messy
YOU1000000012_S0000030	especially when you are trying to sort out your audio issues and removing echo and yeah it is possible but it is definitely complicated and that is probably the biggest thing with these 2
YOU1000000012_S0000031	they are not for the fainthearted you definitely need to invest some time into 0 b s or wirecast to get up to spread because you have got so much control over your live streams in there
YOU1000000012_S0000032	but both of these will not only let you broadcast to facebook live they will both let you also broadcast to other live streaming platforms like youtube live twitch periscope and a heap of others out there as well
YOU1000000012_S0000033	so both great solutions if you want a really professional looking live stream with multiple cameras and yeah complicated setups
YOU1000000012_S0000034	solution number 3 is a piece of software called ecamm live now ecamm live will work on mac only and you can pick it up for 2999
YOU1000000012_S0000035	so crazy cheap especially when you are comparing it to wirecast at $695
YOU1000000012_S0000036	so what ecamm live will let you do is broadcast live currently just to facebook live but they have announced that they will have r t m p
YOU1000000012_S0000037	or opening up their broadcasting capabilities to other streaming platforms like youtube periscope and others as well
YOU1000000012_S0000038	very very soon they have also just announced that they are going to be integrating skype into ecamm live as well so you will have that ability to use skype
YOU1000000012_S0000039	to make calls and live interviews without all the headaches that you can have using wirecast and 0 b s so that is an amazing feature
YOU1000000012_S0000040	and it is crazy that you are getting all of this for under $30 it is actually one of the most complete ways or most polished ways to go live on facebook live
YOU1000000012_S0000041	and to be able to see and monitor all your interactions and hearts and comments and things as you are live that you would not normally get on the facebook live mobile app to go live from the app
YOU1000000012_S0000042	so it is amazing that you get this in a desktop app again it is currently mac only hopefully somewhere in the future they will also release a pc version
YOU1000000012_S0000043	but if you are on mac this piece of software is an absolute no brainer ecamm live also lets you easily share your computer screen or play back videos as well
YOU1000000012_S0000044	so if you have got videos queued up that you want to play in your live stream with the click of a button you can be playing those out and it also supports local disk recording as well
YOU1000000012_S0000045	so whatever you are broadcasting live you are also saving that live stream to your computer with a one click upload to youtube once you have finished your facebook live stream
YOU1000000012_S0000046	so that is pretty cool solution number 4 is a really popular web platform called belive the website is belive dot tv
YOU1000000012_S0000047	so what this lets you do is run everything from your web browser so you do not need to download any software or install anything which means that you can use this on pretty much on any computer
YOU1000000012_S0000048	it seamlessly connects through to any webcam or microphone that you have got set up and running on your computer but also makes it really really easy for you to bring guests into your live stream
YOU1000000012_S0000049	so no one needs to download or install any software you literally just send out the link people can join a waiting room where you can see while you are live that they are there waiting
YOU1000000012_S0000050	and you can invite them on so you are not limited to just bringing one guest on you can actually have 2 guests on so 3 people live on your facebook live stream currently
YOU1000000012_S0000051	you also get some amazing control over your facebook live stream so once again you get to see from the belive interface all your facebook comments
YOU1000000012_S0000052	you get to see how many people are watching you can actually promote or feature comments on your live stream
YOU1000000012_S0000053	all you have to do is when someone is made a comment that you want to feature or promote you click on it and it will be made big on the live stream for everyone to see
YOU1000000012_S0000054	so that is an amazing feature especially if you are going to be doing live q and a as with your audience you can bring up the question or the comment that you are going to be addressing
YOU1000000012_S0000055	so a really cool feature and it is so easy to use this is probably the easiest app out of all the ones we have mentioned and going to be mentioning
YOU1000000012_S0000056	besides number one the facebook website itself this is the easiest one to use it is the most intuitive interface it is really for anyone beginner through to advanced
YOU1000000012_S0000057	belive also lets you share your computer screen easily as well and there is also templates that are setup or presets that are setup in belive
YOU1000000012_S0000058	so when you click them you can change what the view or the display is like for your viewers
YOU1000000012_S0000059	so with the click of a button you can switch between a full screen view of yourself to a 5050 screen split with yourself and someone that you have got on your live stream
YOU1000000012_S0000060	or you can easily split to a 3 way split where you have got 3 people side by side so not only is this an amazing platform for going live
YOU1000000012_S0000061	it is also really amazing how easy it is to use to setup something like this in 0 b s or in wirecast would take a huge amount of time to setup
YOU1000000012_S0000062	but also to manage while you are live now there is 4 pricing options for belive tv there is a free plan which gives you 20 minutes free broadcasting twice a week
YOU1000000012_S0000063	there is a lite plan for $12 per month which lets you do things like add a custom logo branded colors and you have got a limit of 16 broadcast per month
YOU1000000012_S0000064	then above that you have got your standard package which is $20 per month and here the biggest difference is that it is unlimited broadcasts per month
YOU1000000012_S0000065	and your also get access to the advanced features like screen sharing custom branded frames and also early access to new features as they become available
YOU1000000012_S0000066	and the other plan above that is the enterprise plan which at $500 per month is probably going to rule this out for a lot of people here
YOU1000000012_S0000067	with the additional features listed as telephone support custom graphics and custom formats as well
YOU1000000012_S0000068	so i would imagine for most people the lite plan or the standard plan would be what you are after
YOU1000000012_S0000069	number 5 is zoom now zoom is another online platform but this one has the big advantage of being able to bring in a heap of guests into your live streams
YOU1000000012_S0000070	live streaming to facebook and youtube from zoom is actually a relatively new feature that they have added it did start out as a video conferencing software and now they have bought in some more webinar style tools as well
YOU1000000012_S0000071	which obviously let you go live on places like facebook and youtube in zoom you get a heap of advanced controls over
YOU1000000012_S0000072	the people that you are bringing into your call weather it is just you and you have got other people as guests or whether you want to bring other people in as panelists or co hosts
YOU1000000012_S0000073	whether their webcams are on by default or muted where you can control all of that while you are live as well it is also got build in polling it has got a built in chat window
YOU1000000012_S0000074	so you can interact with your audience while you are live from inside the zoom call as well
YOU1000000012_S0000075	one of the big advantages with zoom is how easy it is to create the live call or the live link and get that sent out to your participants or guests that are going to be on the call
YOU1000000012_S0000076	so you have the the call automatically scheduled and entered into your calendar so there is a heap of really professional functionality and reminders that are built in
YOU1000000012_S0000077	all around scheduling the call and making sure that your guests are there and in the right place and also helping them test their audio and their webcam as they join the call
YOU1000000012_S0000078	to make sure that everything is working one of the other really powerful features of zoom is not only does it let you record your
YOU1000000012_S0000079	call or your live directly to your local computer but it also gives you the ability to record your calls and save them in the cloud as well
YOU1000000012_S0000080	and when you enable the cloud recording it actually records 2 files for you it records the speaker view which is the default view
YOU1000000012_S0000081	which changes based on whoever is talking so it is the full screen version of whoever is speaking and switches automatically but it also gives you the gallery view as well
YOU1000000012_S0000082	so if you have got a few people on there then it would show everyone on the screen for that recording so to have that ability you are able to record in 2 separate files
YOU1000000012_S0000083	the 2 different camera views is amazing so in regards to pricing in order to use zoom for live streaming you need to be on their pro plan which costs 1499 per month
YOU1000000012_S0000084	but you are also going to need to add the webinar add on to actually go live which cost an additional $40 per month
YOU1000000012_S0000085	so in order to go live on facebook with zoom you will be spending $55 per month
YOU1000000012_S0000086	so now on to number 6 which is crowdcast now crowdcast and zoom are fairly similar in regards to product offering both of them will let you have live polling
YOU1000000012_S0000087	so you can ask questions to your people watching and see the results in real time they will both have chat they will both handle questions but crowdcast is probably a more polish solution at least for webinars anyway
YOU1000000012_S0000088	what you get in crowdcast though after your live stream is some really advanced detail and analytics about the people that were there
YOU1000000012_S0000089	how long they stayed for where they came in from so the level of analytics and data that you are able to capture in crowdcast is pretty amazing
YOU1000000012_S0000090	crowdcast also has integration with zapier and with drip meaning you can get some great data and analytics through from your live calls into your c r m which is a really cool feature
YOU1000000012_S0000091	crowdcast also has a multi stream feature which is actually what you will need to be a broadcast your crowdcast call or meeting onto facebook live
YOU1000000012_S0000092	but this multi stream feature also let you broadcast to multiple live platforms as well so whether that is multiple facebook live pages accounts groups events or you could broadcast live to facebook and youtube at the same time
YOU1000000012_S0000093	in regards to pricing crowdcast has 3 pricing options
YOU1000000012_S0000094	the 1st is their live package at $49 per month then they have got a professional package at $89 per month and that is actually the one that you are going to need
YOU1000000012_S0000095	if you want to be doing lives to facebook live or youtube live and there is also a business plans as well for $195 per month
YOU1000000012_S0000096	so it is definitely not on the cheaper end of things so the main difference when you are comparing the professional package to the business package is the number of live attendees
YOU1000000012_S0000097	it goes from 250 up to 500 and the cost for an extra live attendee goes from ¢30 down to ¢15 on the business plan
YOU1000000012_S0000098	but keep in mind that these numbers for attendees are not in relation to facebook live this is only for people that are attending your call or your webinar on the actual platform
YOU1000000012_S0000099	if you are going to using this for facebook live which is what we are talking about in this video then there may not be anyone that is actually attending on the actual platform
YOU1000000012_S0000100	they will be watching and interacting with you through facebook live so if all you are interested in is using crowdcast for facebook lives then you will definitely be able to get away with the professional plan
YOU1000000012_S0000101	so those are our top 6 solutions for creating awesome facebook lives whether it is bringing in screen share bringing in one guest 2 guests or a heap of guests into your lie streams
YOU1000000012_S0000102	now as we said there was a huge range in price there is also a huge range in features and capabilities for the different solutions
YOU1000000012_S0000103	now before we get to mind number one tip to automatically getting more of your audience on your live stream as soon as you go live let us do a quick recap of the options
YOU1000000012_S0000104	and who i would recommend each for so if you just want to go live on facebook the simplest and easiest way with no additional guests then you can just use the facebook website
YOU1000000012_S0000105	if you are after the most amount of control for your live streams and you want to bring in multiple screen shares multiple cameras and guests and things as well
YOU1000000012_S0000106	then you can look at 0 b s or wirecast as a professional solution then if you are on a mac and you are looking for a really cheap and easy way to create a professional live stream
YOU1000000012_S0000107	where you get the full interaction with facebook comments and interactions then check out ecamm live
YOU1000000012_S0000108	if you are looking for a really easy way to do a 2 person live a 3 person live and again be able to monitor the comments and feature your comments then belive tv might be the answer for you
YOU1000000012_S0000109	and if you want to do a facebook live with 2 people 3 people 4 people or a lot more then you can look at something like zoom which is a cheap alternative to crowdcast which will also let you do the same thing
YOU1000000012_S0000110	but it is going to give you more analytics and integrations with things like zapier
YOU1000000012_S0000111	so now for my tip to help you get more of your audience onto your facebook lives automatically the solution is to use live leap
YOU1000000012_S0000112	now live leap is a service that helps you automatically share out your facebook lives automatically the moment that you go live
YOU1000000012_S0000113	so whether you are going live to a facebook page a group or an event it is automatically going to share it out to your audience on whatever pages groups twitter even
YOU1000000012_S0000114	or even put a link on your website saying that you are currently live on facebook so this is something if you are serious about doing facebook lives that i can not recommend strongly enough
YOU1000000012_S0000115	it is the easiest way to automatically share out your lives the moment that you go live without you needing to do anything across a heap of different social platforms
YOU1000000012_S0000116	including your website so i will put a link down in the description below if you want to check out live leap
YOU1000000012_S0000117	now if you are going live on facebook from your smart phone there are some simple low cost gear that can help you get much better results
YOU1000000012_S0000118	check out the video linked on screen now for the best facebook live gear for both iphone and android i will see you soon
YOU1000000016_S0000000	in this video we are going to run through exactly how to livestream to multiple platforms at the same time or how to simulcast
YOU1000000016_S0000001	whether it is to youtube live facebook live twitch almost any other platform we have got you covered in this video
YOU1000000016_S0000003	hey it is justin brown here from primal video where we help you amplify your business and brand with video
YOU1000000016_S0000004	if you are new here make sure to click that subscribe button and all the links to everything we mention in this video you can find linked in the description box much below
YOU1000000016_S0000005	so let us just jump into it now with some simple tools these days it is really easy to livestream to multiple platforms in fact there is even a name for it and it is called simulcasting
YOU1000000016_S0000006	so that means you can easily create one livestream and push it out to multiple live platforms
YOU1000000016_S0000007	or streaming sources like facebook live youtube live twitch and a ton of other platforms as well
YOU1000000016_S0000008	now we actually did a video this topic a little while back but since then so much has changed and it has now become so much easier to be able to do this
YOU1000000016_S0000009	so i thought it was time to update that video and run through the new best ways to do this or the new options to be able to do this
YOU1000000016_S0000010	and while we are going through it i want to hear from you guys what social or content platforms are you most active on when it comes to live streaming
YOU1000000016_S0000011	we are going to start to pick up our game a little bit on the youtube live side of things but we may look at other platforms too thanks to simulcasting
YOU1000000016_S0000012	now you have really got 2 main options when it comes to livestreaming to multiple platforms
YOU1000000016_S0000013	the 1st one is to push out multiple streams from your broadcasting software now this is really only possible in software like vmix or like wirecast
YOU1000000016_S0000014	where you are able to set up multiple output sources so instead of just sending your livestream feed to youtube you are also able to add in an additional stream
YOU1000000016_S0000015	for facebook or for twitch or wherever else you would like to broadcast to
YOU1000000016_S0000016	so that was pretty much what we have covered the 1st time we tackled this and i will put a link up to that video because that method still does work
YOU1000000016_S0000017	but the biggest downside with that is that you are actually pushing those multiple streams from your one computer and from your one internet connection
YOU1000000016_S0000018	which means it can put your computer under load but it also can put your internet bandwidth under load
YOU1000000016_S0000019	so if you are going to be pushing multiple streams you will need at least twice the available bandwidth
YOU1000000016_S0000020	or if you are running 3 stream you will need 3 times the bandwidth that you would for one stream across each of the individual streams to be i do not pushed them all out
YOU1000000016_S0000021	the other big downside of multicasting that way was the interactions or the comments they were all separate there was no way to pull them all together
YOU1000000016_S0000022	so you can bring in comments from youtube twitch and facebook all into one chat window for you running the stream to be able to monitor them in one place
YOU1000000016_S0000023	you literally had to go to facebook and then over to twitch and then over to youtube to be able to see each one of those different comment feeds
YOU1000000016_S0000024	so while all that was doable it was a pain to set up and it could be rather frustrating to manage and see everything while you are actually live
YOU1000000016_S0000025	but the option that i am about to show you now option number 2 will require no additional bandwidth will put your computer under no additional load and you will be able to use a larger arrange of livestreaming software
YOU1000000016_S0000026	or platforms to be able to do this
YOU1000000016_S0000027	so what i am talking about here is a multicast or a simulcast platform that you send your livestream to them and they push it out to the different platforms for you
YOU1000000016_S0000028	now there are quite a few platforms out there that offer this service of re broadcasting and re distributing your content out for you
YOU1000000016_S0000029	and in there you have got a massive range from super basic right up to enterprise grade and obviously the enterprise grade ones are going to come with the enterprise price tag
YOU1000000016_S0000030	so there is really 3 main options when it comes to those of us that are looking just to push our livestreams out to multiple places without the need for enterprise stuff
YOU1000000016_S0000031	and the 3 most popular and my top 3 are re stream switchboard and castr
YOU1000000016_S0000032	now all 3 of these make it really simple to push your livestream out to multiple sources at the same time
YOU1000000016_S0000033	so they all support things like youtube live facebook live twitch all the popular ones and they also have r t m p so you can really push your livestream out to anywhere
YOU1000000016_S0000034	using that r t m p protocol
YOU1000000016_S0000035	they also all have integrated comments or integrated chat meaning that no matter which services you are broadcasting to you can pull in the chat to one central location
YOU1000000016_S0000036	making it easy for you to either bring those comments and those chat elements up onscreen in your livestream or just to make it easy for you to monitor
YOU1000000016_S0000037	and interact with people while you are live and all 3 of those also have global servers where you can manually pick the fastest servers or the servers closest to you
YOU1000000016_S0000038	to re broadcast out your livestream with the lowest latency meaning that it is not going to add a delay or a big delay to your livestream for those watching on the different platforms
YOU1000000016_S0000039	it is really going to be almost instant if you are picking a server that is close to your location
YOU1000000016_S0000040	now it is also important to note that facebook live is actually treated a little different it is treated separately from pretty much all the other broadcast platforms out then you will see that when we get to the pricing options
YOU1000000016_S0000041	of theses services and how they treat facebook but it is all to do with the way that facebook actually lets you broadcast live to them
YOU1000000016_S0000042	and in some of these cases you are going to have to pay a little bit extra or a lot more to be able to broadcast to facebook or to multiple facebook locations
YOU1000000016_S0000043	now i am going to quickly run through some of the standout pros and cons for each of these 3 for switchboard for re stream and for castr to help you better decide which one is going to be the pick for you
YOU1000000016_S0000044	but this really is not a full comprehensive review of feature comparison of the 3 this is just the standout pros and cons as far as i am concerned
YOU1000000016_S0000045	to really help you narrow down which one of these is going to be the best fit for you
YOU1000000016_S0000046	alright so restream or restream dot i 0 is probably the most popular and most people is go to platform for multicasting or getting their livestream out to multiple places
YOU1000000016_S0000047	it is by far the most feature rich but its also probably the most unintuitive or the hardest to use
YOU1000000016_S0000048	it has got the most advanced control in regards to the chat or the comment feeds
YOU1000000016_S0000049	and it is also got a p i integration so that is it is really easy to integrate that chat roll into your live streaming software like wirecast and 0 b s
YOU1000000016_S0000050	it also has built in live transcoding which means that you can transcode or convert your livestream into different formats different qualities different sizes
YOU1000000016_S0000051	while you are live to match different platforms that you might be broadcasting live to
YOU1000000016_S0000052	and another great feature is that restream do not limit the amount of bandwidth or the bitrate of the quality of your livestreams going in or out of their service
YOU1000000016_S0000053	they also make it really easy to resize those different versions so if you are broadcasting a wide screen video and you want to convert it in restream
YOU1000000016_S0000054	so that your facebook version is going out in portrait they make that really easy as well
YOU1000000016_S0000055	now there is really 2 main downsides to restream the 1st one i touched on already it is around having all of these extra features but the actual interface is not super intuitive
YOU1000000016_S0000056	or it is not easy to find everything and it can get overwhelming and complicated to go through and just create some simple restreams
YOU1000000016_S0000057	so it is really for probably the more advanced side of things
YOU1000000016_S0000058	the 2nd one is that they add their branding to your livestreams up until you reach their pro plan
YOU1000000016_S0000059	so on their pro plan they will let you remove their branding
YOU1000000016_S0000060	there is not just the branding inside of your livestreams like a watermark on it
YOU1000000016_S0000061	it is actually into your social media streams as well so in restream you can set it up so that when you are live it will tweet out and and maybe do a facebook post out
YOU1000000016_S0000062	but in there it is actually it has got their branding in it it it has got mentions of them and tags them in your posts so i think for anyone that is using this on the business side
YOU1000000016_S0000063	you definitely do not want to have that going on which means you are going to need to start at the pro plan
YOU1000000016_S0000064	so it is not a deal breaker but it just means that you have got to be using thee pro plan to get rid of all of that branding
YOU1000000016_S0000065	now when it comes to pricing they have split this off into 2 so you have got individual pricing plans and you have got company pricing plans
YOU1000000016_S0000066	if it was a free plan that let you broadcast out your stream to 30 plus streaming platforms
YOU1000000016_S0000067	but that does not include facebook there is also a standard plan at $16 per month and that gives you access to livestream to one facebook channel
YOU1000000016_S0000068	and also gives you the ability in real time to switch or toggle between or on or off the different live streaming platforms
YOU1000000016_S0000069	and then you have got the professional plan which is $41 per month this will give you access to 3 facebook channels and also it takes the branding off as well
YOU1000000016_S0000070	now the transcoding that i mentioned just before is an additional $2 per hour for the length of your livestream
YOU1000000016_S0000071	now up from that they do have premium business and enterprise plans available as well
YOU1000000016_S0000072	and this gives you access to 5 facebook channels on the premium and 15 facebook channels on the business now we see the enterprise one is for those that are really crazy serious above and beyond that point
YOU1000000016_S0000073	the next option you have got is switchboard or switchboard dot live now this is another really awesome platform to be able to multicast your livestreams out
YOU1000000016_S0000074	they have got a really intuitive really easy to use interface it is so easy to quickly jump in
YOU1000000016_S0000075	link up your channels your facebook pages and those sorts of things and start to broadcast out from there
YOU1000000016_S0000076	once again they have got really great chat integration not quite to the level that you get in restream but still really solid and still they make it pretty easy to get it into your live streaming programs as well
YOU1000000016_S0000077	and you have also got transcoding capabilities again to push the different versions for different platforms but one of the cool features that you have got inside of switchboard is
YOU1000000016_S0000078	that for each one of the broadcasts that you have or each one of the platforms that you are broadcasting to you can totally customize them up
YOU1000000016_S0000079	to have even individual branding so your facebook livestream could have different branding to your youtube livestream which has totally different branding to your twitch livestreams
YOU1000000016_S0000080	so even while the content that you are broadcasting out from your computer is the same you have got a different version or different logos and those sorts of things on each of them
YOU1000000016_S0000081	all managed through switchboard even little things like being able to bulk start and stop streams and multiple streams is just so easy to do inside of switchboard so they make a lot of this stuff really really easy
YOU1000000016_S0000082	it is now when regards to the downsides of switchboard i think most of these are really based around their pricing models
YOU1000000016_S0000083	and the restrictions that come in at the different pricing models so 1st off there is no free option but there is a $99 per month professional plan
YOU1000000016_S0000084	and that is actually their lowest entry level plan now they do have a 14 day trial available
YOU1000000016_S0000085	but on that plan your livestreams are going to be restricted to 5 megabits per 2nd and at a maximum resolution of 1080 p
YOU1000000016_S0000086	but they will let you broadcast out simultaneously to 5 providers and 2 of those include facebook
YOU1000000016_S0000087	now they also have restrictions around the duration of your livestreams and your multicast as well
YOU1000000016_S0000088	on their professional plan you are limited to 50 hours per month
YOU1000000016_S0000089	and 12 hours per livestream now depending on the type and the amount of livestreaming that you are actually doing none of those may come into effect
YOU1000000016_S0000090	may affect you too much but they do have 2 other plans listed on their website for business and for enterprise but neither one of them has pricing available
YOU1000000016_S0000091	so you need to reach out if you are interested in pricing for those but obviously with those a lot of those restrictions
YOU1000000016_S0000092	have been moved or raised
YOU1000000016_S0000093	so now for the 3rd option which was castr or castr dot i 0 now this is probably the new kid on the block
YOU1000000016_S0000094	and it is actually probably the most compelling offer as well and the one that i am the most excited about there you go just spoilt the rest of the video for you
YOU1000000016_S0000095	but this is the one that i think is going to be the game changer going forward and could really have a big impact
YOU1000000016_S0000096	on the other 2 options moving forward now castr once again is really easy to use
YOU1000000016_S0000097	but i think the biggest reason that castr is super easy to use is that it is not filled with all the additional features and bells and whistles
YOU1000000016_S0000098	as the other 2 that we have seen now there is no ads there is no bandwidth limitations and there is no stream time or limits
YOU1000000016_S0000099	on how long you can actually broadcast for they even say on their on their website that you could stream 247 through their platform if you wanted to
YOU1000000016_S0000100	other big feature that castr has is the ability to do cloud recording so you can actually do a full recording of whatever it is you are livestreaming
YOU1000000016_S0000101	without needing to save it locally on your computer
YOU1000000016_S0000102	and just like the other 2 it does have integrated chat as well
YOU1000000016_S0000103	and they even show you on their website how to bring it into places like wirecast
YOU1000000016_S0000104	now what castr does not have straight out of the box anyway is those transcoding and reformatting options that you had in restream and in switchboard
YOU1000000016_S0000105	but they do have another service offering that ties in with castr that does give you access to all of those things if you need them
YOU1000000016_S0000106	so now looking at the pricing options i think this is really where castr shines i have a free plan with no branding no watermarks
YOU1000000016_S0000107	no restrictions around bandwidth or the amount of time you can livestream for totally free they will let you share that out to 5 publishing locations
YOU1000000016_S0000108	including one facebook channel they also have a $9 99 per month plan which gives you up to 10 publishing locations
YOU1000000016_S0000109	and 2 facebook channels and for 2999 you get unlimited locations and 5 facebook channels
YOU1000000016_S0000110	now like i said at the start of the video we are not getting into the nitty gritty of each of these 3 platforms we are specifically looking at
YOU1000000016_S0000111	multicasting and broadcasting your livestream out to multiple platforms these are in my opinion the best 3 to do that and you can also see
YOU1000000016_S0000112	that they are all so completely different offerings now if you are someone who is on the more advanced side of things and you are looking for all the features all the controls
YOU1000000016_S0000113	all the bells and whistles then you are really probably not going to be looking at castr you are going to be more looking at restream or at switchboard
YOU1000000016_S0000114	now obviously with those 2 which one is going to be the best fit for you you have really got to come back to those pricing tables and see what the restrictions are
YOU1000000016_S0000115	and what you actually get access to for those different plans
YOU1000000016_S0000116	but if you are someone who is not looking for all those advance features and really wants the best bang for buck to be able to get your broadcast out to multiple platforms
YOU1000000016_S0000117	then it is really going to go hands down to castr i really think that what they are offering especially for the price and even on the free plan is just insane and it is
YOU1000000016_S0000118	again it is easy to get up and running and get it working with your livestreaming platform so i am going to quickly log in to castr and show you how easy it is to get set up
YOU1000000016_S0000119	once you are logged in all you need to do is go to add a stream and choose new restream
YOU1000000016_S0000120	and pop up on the side to give your stream a name let us just go test
YOU1000000016_S0000121	one and select your region
YOU1000000016_S0000123	i am in australia now so i will pick sydney but clue choose the closest one to you
YOU1000000016_S0000124	and press save
YOU1000000016_S0000125	next all you need to do is to add in the platforms that you want to broadcast to so you come over here and go add platform
YOU1000000016_S0000126	and these are all the supported platforms so you can either choose a custom server or pick one of the ones that are preset in here
YOU1000000016_S0000127	so let us just use youtube now in this case you need to connect your channel by signing into your youtube channel
YOU1000000016_S0000128	or you can use your own server or stream key that is provided in the platform
YOU1000000016_S0000129	once you have logged in and it says youtube is connected and saving now this is where you can give your youtube stream a title
YOU1000000016_S0000130	test stream
YOU1000000016_S0000131	one obviously you want to come up with something a bit more creative you can also add in your stream description in there as well and hit save down at the bottom
YOU1000000016_S0000132	so now that you have got youtube in there we can add in another platform as well just going through the exact same process
YOU1000000016_S0000133	so i will back out of this now cancel that one
YOU1000000016_S0000135	so you can queue up all of your different platforms in here
YOU1000000016_S0000136	then all you need to all you need to know here is this is your streaming details that you will put into your live streaming software
YOU1000000016_S0000137	so whether it is 0 b s xsplit wirecast vmix this is your streaming server and this is your streaming key so once you have set that up
YOU1000000016_S0000138	in your application and started you livestream then your livestream will show up here it says waiting for stream so then all you need to do is come over to
YOU1000000016_S0000139	your livestreaming software for this case we are going to use 0 b s
YOU1000000016_S0000140	and we will go settings go to stream and under stream type you want to choose custom streaming server
YOU1000000016_S0000141	and this is where you post paste in your server and your stream key hit okay
YOU1000000016_S0000143	and now when we hit start streaming we will see a pop up over here that our stream is coming through and then you can toggle on and off
YOU1000000016_S0000144	the different providers while you are actually live
YOU1000000016_S0000145	then you can bring up your chat overlay or the chat u r l that you can visit to view and interact with the chat that is also what you will use to bring into wirecast or 0 b s
YOU1000000016_S0000146	or you can sync your chat with discord as well so now that you are all set up to livestream to multiple platforms with twice the potential audience
YOU1000000016_S0000147	that is twice as important for you to nail your lighting and to get your lighting looking just right great segue justin
YOU1000000016_S0000148	linked on screen is a video which is the complete lighting tutorial to help you out with the lighting in your videos and the other video is a video from youtube
YOU1000000016_S0000149	i do not know could be good let me know i will see you soon
YOU1000000020_S0000001	magic gathering is a collectible card game it is strategic in nature it has got a little bit of hidden information where you are hiding your cards from your opponent
YOU1000000020_S0000002	you are playing your cards onto the battle field attacking and blocking with them and trying to reduce your opponent to 0 life
YOU1000000020_S0000003	people collect the cards like baseball cards
YOU1000000020_S0000004	then they play a strategy game with them it is kind of a combination of poker and chess poker in that you play with the cards you draw but chess and then each card is like a different pace
YOU1000000020_S0000005	from the cards you collect you get to customize your own deck and your own experience and make it your own
YOU1000000020_S0000006	when your true foes reveal themselves will you do everything in your power to conquer them
YOU1000000020_S0000008	it has a fantasy flavor and feel to it that can be something that is very important to you all the way down to not that important to you at all
YOU1000000020_S0000009	one of the things that makes magic accessible to new players is that luck is absolutely going to be a factor unlike a game like chess where you will always loose if you are worse
YOU1000000020_S0000010	in magic you sometimes win and its kind of like a little bit of a gateway you know like it helps you feel good while you are learning
YOU1000000020_S0000011	magic is the biggest now left ever been by a lot
YOU1000000020_S0000013	i think we just certainly upwards to 1000000 people playing the game worldwide
YOU1000000020_S0000015	no matter which language you speak the rules are are the same everywhere your cards might be in english his cards might be japanese but you both can communicate there easily
YOU1000000020_S0000016	when i was growing up most people who were you know playing games were not really seen as the cool kids but now you know there is professional gamers on you know t v
YOU1000000020_S0000017	you this is just so much more a part of the culture than it was 1015 years ago
YOU1000000020_S0000018	alright i am going to play a 5th manner card and then i am going to attack with my elder beast
YOU1000000020_S0000019	can can he block the elder beast
YOU1000000020_S0000020	not with his shape shifter its already dead

YOU1000000020_S0000029	jacob has not attacked even once
YOU1000000020_S0000031	jacob really needs to not play this harmonics over here
YOU1000000020_S0000033	shawn mclaren is it static caster
YOU1000000020_S0000035	kill your birds of paradise and that is the end shawn mclaren is your champion he is king of the hill
YOU1000000020_S0000037	jacob congratulations i can tell of course you are disappointed who would not be

YOU1000000020_S0000039	yup well come back win the next one lades and gentlemen your finalist a great ambassador for the game jacob wilson good job
YOU1000000020_S0000041	the magic pro tour has approach the highest competitive stage for magic there is 4 major events a year the pro tours that each have a quarter $1000000 prize pool with $40000 to the winner
YOU1000000020_S0000042	you could only attend the pro tours if you are invited
YOU1000000020_S0000043	you have to win or qualify a tournament just to get invited to a tournament that invites you to the pro tour
YOU1000000020_S0000044	probably a couple 1000 people show up over the course of the weekend you know there is a live broadcast so the pro tours are definitely the marquee events of magic
YOU1000000020_S0000046	this is an important tournament for jacob in a big way he had a bitter loss in his 1st pro tour i remember looking at him after that happened
YOU1000000020_S0000047	for somebody who does not show that much emotion on a regular basis he was destroyed by that
YOU1000000020_S0000049	2nd place is the most painful position to finish
YOU1000000020_S0000050	sometimes people joke about 2nd place being tied for dead last
YOU1000000020_S0000051	i think that might have been the 1st time we saw jacob like you know he has this kind of like flat exterior when he is playing magic
YOU1000000020_S0000052	and it was kind of shocking to see him be kind of like almost like crushed to lose in the finals it is like being dropped off a cliff
YOU1000000020_S0000053	right when i lost i was kind of in disbelief i had won 2 out of the 1st 3 games and i felt advantaged and i really just thought that it was a guarantee
YOU1000000020_S0000054	immediately after i was pretty devastated and definitely bitter i am jacob wilson and i am a professional magic player
YOU1000000020_S0000056	i was introduced to magic when i was really young and when i was 15 i just start playing in local tournaments like once a week and when i got 2nd place at the pro tour
YOU1000000020_S0000057	i ended up going from like a $100 my bank account to 30000 and like i was paying for school all by myself
YOU1000000020_S0000058	at the beginning of this fall semester i was qualified for the world championships it was a lot of work to do school and magic at the same time so i wanted to take the semester off and just prepare the whole time
YOU1000000020_S0000060	right now one of my biggest goals is to win a pro tour and if i were to accomplish that it would be a huge achievement and definitely one of the biggest ones of my life
YOU1000000020_S0000062	tonight could definitely be a late night often i am a little bit too excited to sleep right before a big tournament like this
YOU1000000020_S0000064	yeah i i i think it is pretty important to get a good night is sleep
YOU1000000020_S0000065	i think most people try to
YOU1000000020_S0000066	a lot of people used like adderall to flip this stuff like that
YOU1000000020_S0000067	i got sleeping pills
YOU1000000020_S0000068	yeah
YOU1000000020_S0000069	i like to wake up long before the tournament so pretty soon i will be taking a sleeping pill and listen to some music and go to sleep
YOU1000000020_S0000071	the pro scene is divided from a lot of people is experience playing magic it can be so many different things to so many different people
YOU1000000020_S0000072	for you know the average person who is playing it is much more likely a way that they sort of blow off steam after work or just get together with friends or a way that they bond with their family members
YOU1000000020_S0000074	ma worry about the food more
YOU1000000020_S0000075	yeah yeah the food almost done
YOU1000000020_S0000076	so ma what are we cooking today
YOU1000000020_S0000077	this is puttanesca sauce we are going to have a little picnic and we will have some stuffed chicken breast for dessert
YOU1000000020_S0000078	nice when people get invited to the freedom house they know they are going to get 2 things high level vintage magic and great pasta
YOU1000000020_S0000080	over there is our collection cards that cards that we use to play magic
YOU1000000020_S0000081	yeah those cards there could provide a little a lot of hours work lot of hours of fun lot of hours with family and friend recreation so that is really what it is
YOU1000000020_S0000082	certain cards even remember what you were when you opened them like the class asardea
YOU1000000020_S0000084	we would always have a fantasy background starting from my oldest brothers which are read a lot of tolkien is work you know we all read the chronicles of narnia
YOU1000000020_S0000085	and then eventually i stumbled upon magic it was actually in the back of chemistry class
YOU1000000020_S0000086	well i am any jack italian nerd it is part of what makes me me it is a lot of the old stuff right here
YOU1000000020_S0000087	savannah lions and jade statues i mean things like this completely
YOU1000000020_S0000088	specifically why this why this savannah lion is kept in plastic is that it actually single handedly won ralph is beta black look
YOU1000000020_S0000089	that card effectively won this one beta black look
YOU1000000020_S0000090	they are very valuable to about 1993 more we open up a packs you are paying $3 per pack now if we turn in to sell it it could it could probably be the down payment on our house
YOU1000000020_S0000091	i mean it is just absurd what that has to the game
YOU1000000020_S0000092	another reason you know that definitely love the game and why we play vintage is the older art work like
YOU1000000020_S0000093	sir angels the card i have around simply cause i have always loved the art work
YOU1000000020_S0000095	this is the backbone of my deck it is called mishes workshop
YOU1000000020_S0000097	to me i am very much gravitate towards the art i always appreciated the fantasy art aspect
YOU1000000020_S0000099	there was some early pieces of art which had some symbolism which i think provoked people to bring out the bad aspects of fantasy
YOU1000000020_S0000100	there were 2 cards in particular demonic tutor and unholy strength which had antigrams on them
YOU1000000020_S0000102	there was such negative connotation to ritualistic activities or
YOU1000000020_S0000103	anything to do with sacrifices and burnt offerings and all of these terms just started to surface
YOU1000000020_S0000104	magic the gathering so let us see where they are coming from how many of you see a pentagram if you look there it is
YOU1000000020_S0000105	exceptional parents why i do not want my kids playing this because i do not like the imagery
YOU1000000020_S0000106	here is one of the cards till dead rotting decaying thing that has been in the ground and member it say it that it is an occult game
YOU1000000020_S0000107	one of the dangers of this thing is that it is played with the mind how many know that the mind is a very fragile thing
YOU1000000020_S0000108	teenage kids their parents still had influence on what they could play
YOU1000000020_S0000109	now it is different
YOU1000000020_S0000110	they quickly retracted those printings and that really quelled a lot of the fires of the whole satanic imagery
YOU1000000020_S0000111	that negative paradigm at least that followed magic in the beginning years are now over and i think you starting to see now the growth of it is changing
YOU1000000020_S0000113	i look at fantasy as one of my little escapes
YOU1000000020_S0000115	for those couple hours that i am playing allows me to just shh you know i will come back to my problem when i am finished
YOU1000000020_S0000117	the pro tour player in particular it is a grind those guys will sleep on someone is couch one wednesday wake up next wednesday anywhere else what i mean it is a grind to those guys
YOU1000000020_S0000118	i just wonder how much fun all of them are having damn sure there are people that find awarding just not for me not for our community
YOU1000000020_S0000119	yeah absolutely
YOU1000000020_S0000121	we always made a communal we have always believed in in that aspect of it maybe that is why we gravitate and mix it so well
YOU1000000020_S0000122	you know we treated one fairly we try and not to make people feel uncomfortable if if they are new we kind of walk with them because no one is bigger than the game
YOU1000000020_S0000123	alright the game has to be about community
YOU1000000020_S0000125	we would like to welcome you to the pro tour feat reforged in d c congratulations for qualifying and have a very very good weekend thank you
YOU1000000020_S0000126	keep your head straight in front of you if you are looking to the side we may misinterpret where you were looking so please keep your head straight ahead of you
YOU1000000020_S0000128	i won the 1st round which is great it is so it is good to get after a good start my opponent forgot something that would have benefited him
YOU1000000020_S0000129	like if you forget what your card does it is not my responsibility to remind him
YOU1000000020_S0000131	i am normally pretty quiet with my opponent during the game i do not really like to chit chat
YOU1000000020_S0000132	he he he can be sometimes quiet he is a he is a real quiet guy i have not really gotten to know him super well
YOU1000000020_S0000133	jacob wilson attacking for league while using path to exile just saw a handshake
YOU1000000020_S0000134	he is always very even very calm and always finds the right play
YOU1000000020_S0000136	0 he finally swap through how do you beat that so jacob wilson moves on
YOU1000000020_S0000138	it is the end of the day and i finish 7 to one which is pretty great it is the best record i have ever had at a pro tour i can not really ask for much more
YOU1000000020_S0000139	dude you won 7 to one today that is fucking insane i know that is great great work thanks
YOU1000000020_S0000141	we are holding white bits of paper and that means its time for the end of day wrap jacob wilson is ahead of the curve
YOU1000000020_S0000142	you you have already called it there you are saying jacob wilson for the win
YOU1000000020_S0000143	a terrific job by him and all these players here on behalf of everyone at wizards of the coast saying bye
YOU1000000020_S0000146	alright mama bye
YOU1000000020_S0000148	vintage is a great game and not only because of the old nostalgic cards alpha cards the dramatic plays the true reason why it is great is the community
YOU1000000020_S0000149	the people that make up the game are amazing everyone is friendly everyone is accepting here you walk into a room and you have 40 friends
YOU1000000020_S0000151	this is vintage right now we are doing 8 men tournament just getting together with friends and playing cards
YOU1000000020_S0000153	my core strategy is generally to stop what he wants to do slowly picture a boa constrictor
YOU1000000020_S0000154	slowly wrapping around somebody and once he is in a perfect position now he can squeeze at the air out of them
YOU1000000020_S0000155	but i have to up get the boa cause they has to get in position 1st that is the best way i could explain what the deck wants to do its planning it out
YOU1000000020_S0000156	it is how do you get there t is it is stopping your opponent from doing what he wants to while it slowly reeling him in
YOU1000000020_S0000158	well i really say about vintages it really is how the game was intended to be played
YOU1000000020_S0000159	if vintage is the purest form of the game it plays with all the cards from originally printed up until the one is which are being heart of the prices
YOU1000000020_S0000160	wiz of the coasters that are the creator of of this game they kind of i guess believed there were errors in the original card that were made
YOU1000000020_S0000161	and they kind of wanted to put them away in a small place where they can be forgotten about
YOU1000000020_S0000162	they definitely left us out in the cold a little bit and that is why in the vintage community we had to self regulate why people look at us as the worldwide west because we have had you know a little bit of the culture look from the parent company
YOU1000000020_S0000163	my opponent right now is a great phantom he is a very well known in the vintage community we you know we put out some really good players from him
YOU1000000020_S0000165	i got into looking at misprints of cards they probably should have been caught and destroyed by quality control but did not for example these 2
YOU1000000020_S0000166	there is actually no physical card here this has too much blue this has too much black ink there are miss cut cards that come in packs my friend just found these
YOU1000000020_S0000167	we really did not have a story on it you know i thought they were incredible i thought i would get them framed at 1st but then every time an opportunity came we wanted to get another misprint i definitely wanted to
YOU1000000020_S0000168	anything else in there that is worth seeing
YOU1000000020_S0000169	yes but i realized i actually can not show you something in here but i will show you guys privately yeah that is why i am stopping you now
YOU1000000020_S0000170	what is wrong with it
YOU1000000020_S0000173	today is the day it looks like he has this one
YOU1000000020_S0000174	and sid for he knows are the godfathers and a lot of people do regard them as the creators of these certain deck
YOU1000000020_S0000175	anytime you bring up these old decks they are like 0 yeah if he already knows who build this and built that
YOU1000000020_S0000177	you were talking earlier about pro tours and all these kids are kind of young do you ever think that you would have kind to do that
YOU1000000020_S0000178	i tell you what they would i there is a part of me as being an actual competitor i probably would not have mind a small opportunity to have done it
YOU1000000020_S0000179	i would have been at the appropriate age right now we are trying to win a world championship in this format that is that is your actual call but the answer to the question i would have given it a chance
YOU1000000020_S0000181	welcome to day 2 of pro tour fate reforged coming to you live
YOU1000000020_S0000182	now when you get to the late stages of the tournament like this there is a lot on the line
YOU1000000020_S0000183	jacob wilson has been utterly dominant this weekend but he just suffered a brutal loss in the heads of eric forlac and if he does not make the top 8 that last play is going to come back to haunt him
YOU1000000020_S0000186	here we are it is the last round of the day it all comes down to this if jacob wilson wins he advances to the final day if he loses he is done
YOU1000000020_S0000187	our 1st player seth nanfield standing in his way jacob wilson
YOU1000000020_S0000189	alright here is lava spike to take jacob wilson down to 10
YOU1000000020_S0000191	down to 2 is jacob
YOU1000000020_S0000193	jacob is turning the tables and going on the offensive here he has got his guns blazing against seth and seth has fallen to 6
YOU1000000020_S0000194	this is just about as close as they get
YOU1000000020_S0000196	that is game that is going to do it jacob wilson has won
YOU1000000020_S0000197	he had a single copy of that card in his deck and it showed up at just the right time what are the odds
YOU1000000020_S0000198	how do you feel as seth nanfield right now
YOU1000000020_S0000199	i want to throw up
YOU1000000020_S0000201	i am very blessed i almost lost i should things i almost lost even with the ling long i did not have the things i would have lost
YOU1000000020_S0000203	so jacob was about to die to a lethal barrage of burn spells and then cast a drew his single copy of the white ley line to protect himself
YOU1000000020_S0000204	and his opponent had one chance to draw something he did not and pulled out the win
YOU1000000020_S0000205	from canada jacob wilson
YOU1000000020_S0000207	if i win the pro tour that would be a defining moment of my life magic is the thing i have put the most effort into and winning the pro tour is the biggest accomplishment you can have in magic
YOU1000000020_S0000209	hello and welcome to the last quarter final of pro tour theater forge we are going to start off with yelger wegishima against jacob wilson a 19 year old
YOU1000000020_S0000210	returning to the top 8 of a modern pro tour made the finals last year
YOU1000000020_S0000211	let us get right down to the floor and see who is going to win between yelger wegishima and jacob wilson
YOU1000000020_S0000213	yelger is hand has everything
YOU1000000020_S0000215	jacob is in game 3 in a 2 out of 3 against
YOU1000000020_S0000216	yelger wegishima who is a dutch hall of fame magic player so not an easy opponent
YOU1000000020_S0000218	game one yelger had an instant win combo that involved making an infinite number of fairies that all attack at once for infinite damage
YOU1000000020_S0000219	and then in game 2 jacob was able to survive despite the fact that yelger rained an anger of the gods that destroyed all of jacob is creatures
YOU1000000020_S0000220	but then jacob summoned an elephant soldier called loxodon smider that finished the job and killed yelger in game 2 so now we re onto game 3
YOU1000000020_S0000221	jacob has got a very good start but yelger is deck is capable of winning in an eye blink so the suspense is pretty good
YOU1000000020_S0000223	voice researches is running through what could he have jacob does not have a lot of outs here things are not looking good for him
YOU1000000020_S0000225	going to put this spluncher twin on this pestermite do you have a response shows the path to exile to yelger who now will show him the disbow
YOU1000000020_S0000226	and that should be
YOU1000000020_S0000228	the game there is the end yelger wigishima advances to the semi finals over jacob wilson
YOU1000000020_S0000230	another great performance from young jacob wilson but it was not quite enough against the dutch hall of famer i know this has to be so disappointing for him
YOU1000000020_S0000232	you are graded on how many top 8s you have achieved i think that ultimately jacob is going to embrace that fact
YOU1000000020_S0000233	and as he starts stacking up more and more top base you are going to see him accept the fact that there is something to be gained for making to top 8
YOU1000000020_S0000234	even if it is not winning the tournament and for such a young person he is already off to a great start
YOU1000000020_S0000236	there definitely is a balance of skill and luck in magic anybody can win the better players often going to win but that is one of the main appeals i think
YOU1000000020_S0000238	having a variety of experience is possible because of the element of chance is a huge part of just games be it
YOU1000000020_S0000240	magic is ever changing and the card are continuing to be good the sets they produce continue to be excellent and if that stopped then magic would take a step back but
YOU1000000020_S0000241	you know if you are going to keep making great cards and making the game interesting and the game is going to continue to to really excel
YOU1000000020_S0000242	you know magic is 20 years old you know magic is old enough that there are people who played the game when they were younger who are sharing it with you know their younger generations
YOU1000000020_S0000243	good game g g g g okay you want to play another round
YOU1000000020_S0000244	yeah let us go
YOU1000000020_S0000246	we have been playing this for 20 years now it is such really a part of us that i am expecting to be at b t tours 20 years from now and i am expecting to be the old man
YOU1000000020_S0000247	and when someone looks at me and he is 1820 years old and he says 0 i guess this old guy does not know what he is doing he is in for a shock he is in for surprise to know that i am playing this for 40 years
YOU1000000020_S0000248	as long as i have the faculties to play it i will play
YOU1000000020_S0000250	i am definitely enjoying magic right now and i can see playing it for a while if this year does go poorly and i do not make platinum i would also be happy to go back to school and try
YOU1000000020_S0000252	to put more of my effort into that
YOU1000000020_S0000254	this is the one invitational in richmond i am here with our champion jacob wilson congratulations man with a hand shake that is a little bit of hardware you are no stranger to this
YOU1000000020_S0000255	yeah i will put these with my other one
YOU1000000020_S0000257	okay 7 cards right
YOU1000000020_S0000258	alright 7 cards
YOU1000000020_S0000259	it is really fun just started playing today and i am decent
YOU1000000020_S0000260	you are decent i am a noob i have
YOU1000000020_S0000261	we are both noobs
YOU1000000020_S0000262	but we are okay
YOU1000000020_S0000263	we are teaching each other kind of
YOU1000000020_S0000264	we are learning
YOU1000000020_S0000266	you kidding me right now i just need land one land and i can destroy you
YOU1000000020_S0000267	you had nothing you scrub
YOU1000000020_S0000268	i did not know anything about magic until today except for that it was a card game and now i am already obsessed with it
YOU1000000023_S0000001	fire emblem this magnificent franchise pushes the boundaries of gaming by daring to ask the question what if chess made you horny
YOU1000000023_S0000002	fire emblem is turning 30 next year and with 16 main games and a few spinoffs it is safe to say that it has grown into something extraordinary the games are packed with deep story lines and memorable characters like marth
YOU1000000023_S0000003	that is not marth marth that is which one is marth
YOU1000000023_S0000005	marth
YOU1000000023_S0000006	the problem with having such a prolific series is that the characters start to blend together one needs only to look at the super smash bros roster to see that fire emblem characters are a bit hard to differentiate
YOU1000000023_S0000007	it is like trying to remember your coworkers names after meeting them once at a work mixer except in this case your coworkers all have swords and can only make one facial expression
YOU1000000023_S0000009	but do not worry there is an answer to this conundrum because today i am going to teach you how to tell apart every fire emblem character
YOU1000000023_S0000011	my face is just not built for this expression
YOU1000000023_S0000012	1st step in this process is to collect a list of the characters turns out even after trimming the non playable ones and the ones from the tokyo mirage sessions there are nearly 600 fire emblem characters
YOU1000000023_S0000013	i cannot explain that many characters i have made that mistake before trying to categorize all 600 castlevania monsters was a bad idea but the beauty of making mistakes is that you can learn from them
YOU1000000023_S0000014	and i now understand that explaining 600 discrete characters would not actually be helpful human beings are not meant to remember 600 people perfectly if you do not believe me just try to remember something about every single person in your contact list
YOU1000000023_S0000015	i have a contact for someone name zain and in the company it just says bocce ball
YOU1000000023_S0000017	who the fuck is this but unlike my contact list fire emblem is have plotlines and in my experience playing these games i noticed that a lot of these different characters fit similar roles in their respective games
YOU1000000023_S0000018	and i am not the only one who is noticed this on the fire emblem wiki there is a whole list of archetypes based on different characters a list that i only found after spending a whole day trying to categorize them on my own
YOU1000000023_S0000019	and it is just so fun to realize that you have wasted a whole day of work but this list intrigued me stock characters in similar circumstances playing again and again in different stories
YOU1000000023_S0000020	does that remind you of anything of course it does it reminds you of the commedia dell arte because it reminds me of the commedia dell arte and it is so obviously the commedia dell arte that i do not need to explain it
YOU1000000023_S0000021	but i will for the sake of extending this video the commedia dell arte was an italian form of theater that was big in the 16th to 18th centuries and it relied on stock characters wearing masks or costumes to designate who they were
YOU1000000023_S0000022	that way the audience could be like that dude is wearing a tight fitting suit with a bunch of weird patches that must be arlecchino the servant clown sometimesto 2 masters this brought the audience in immediately they knew what that character was about without any exposition
YOU1000000023_S0000023	in the same way fire emblem has dozens of recurring characters that get you through each game and this is how we are going to tell them apart by defining their archetypes
YOU1000000023_S0000024	fire emblem goes one step further because these characters can not only serve the same story purpose but they can have a similar role in the game play
YOU1000000023_S0000025	and this goes to prove my theory that fire emblem is not only the spiritual successor to commedia dell arte it is its natural evolution an elevated form i call the commedia dell anime
YOU1000000023_S0000026	the newer more perfect form of theater we just have to boil down the fire emblem personnel into syrupy stock characters let us begin with the archetypes that are standard
YOU1000000023_S0000027	cain and abel are battle bros they fight together but not in the biblical sense bord and cords are similar except they are usually ax fighters pegasus sisters are a trio of flying horses ladies
YOU1000000023_S0000028	you can not split these archetypes up into their solo characters because their bond is what defines them you can not have a waluigi without a luigi and in the same way you can not have a bord without a cord which is my favorite doctor seuss book
YOU1000000023_S0000029	jagens are mentors that are strong in the beginning and then you will quickly outpace them and it is kind of sad like the 1st time you beat your dad in a basketball game oifeys are similar to jagens except they will keep dunking on you till you are dead
YOU1000000023_S0000030	wendells are mentors but for magic gotohs are mentors but only the last half of the game beowolfs are mercenaries that you have to pay actual in game currency to recruit and ogmas are mercenaries that usually decide to join you out of their own volition
YOU1000000023_S0000031	which is by definition not a mercenary navarres are silent moody sword swingers kind of like if that person who said they studied the blade actually studied the blade there are also a bunch of villains but for different reasons
YOU1000000023_S0000032	power ambition loyalty wyvern riding i guess and getting possessed which is a classic mistake
YOU1000000023_S0000033	some archetypes are based on their game play requirements very difficult to recruit usually recruited after they have been kidnapped late game recruits that could be good but you have to work hard super low level villagers that could also be good and if you recruit one of these pairs
YOU1000000023_S0000034	you can not get the other kind of like if 2 of your friends start dating and then have a really messy breakup corneliuses are usually the parental figure to the main character and they have this nasty habit of getting axed super early on in the game
YOU1000000023_S0000035	it is kind of like fire emblem does not know how to make interesting characters without making them suffer traumatic parental death
YOU1000000023_S0000037	tacticians young female mages young female healers young male mages
YOU1000000023_S0000039	thieves
YOU1000000023_S0000041	jeorges do that thing where they pretend to be not important and then surprise i was not an old crone i was a magical witch the whole time except they are not very good at hiding the fact that they are important and the creepy version of the jeorges the tikis
YOU1000000023_S0000042	usually they take the form of a small girl or adolescent except they are really 400 years old and a god or a dragon and i honestly do not have the time to unpack this bullshit
YOU1000000023_S0000043	these 29 archetypes are useful but they only cover 229 characters there are still 367 to go if we keep this up we are going to end up with 75 archetypes
YOU1000000023_S0000044	the commedia dell arte only has about 17 so before we move on let us combine some these 6 are all mentors to varying degrees of usefulness these are all defined by their villainy and only some of them become playable
YOU1000000023_S0000045	welcome to cain siblings incorporated where we all have a sibling like bond and do the same job these all have very specific requirements for recruiting these both do that thing where they do not seem important and then surprise i am important
YOU1000000023_S0000046	these are all hard to make good but they are worth it if you put the effort in these are all precocious little magic babies and that leaves the navarres unconnected but that is because i am changing the archetype to spicy swords
YOU1000000023_S0000047	because we can include so many other characters if we just expand the definitions to any sword wielder who is a little spicy
YOU1000000023_S0000048	in fact by combining these other archetypes there are now tons of other characters who fit into these expanded definitions we are left with 288 characters to categorize
YOU1000000023_S0000049	but before i get there i just want to commend fire emblem for have 596 playable characters and only repeating 3 names when i was hired for my 1st job at a climbing gym i was one of 5 employees named brian
YOU1000000023_S0000050	and it was a small gym but i guess it is pretty easy to cut out repetitions when you use dope ass names like skrimir dagdar sleuf fjorm belf
YOU1000000023_S0000052	i could go on all day but i will not because it is time to get the rest of the archetypes on the wall
YOU1000000023_S0000054	that took like 30 minutes but let us begin the honorable knight like fiona who cares passionately about her people and will always oppose cruelty to civilians
YOU1000000023_S0000055	which is way better than the loyal knight like troude who only is loyal to perne and will do literally anything for him even though perne is a bad dude but i will get to that later
YOU1000000023_S0000056	these 4 archetypes are calm and aloof and the only thing that differentiates them is how much you would want to invite them to your birthday party i am just going to get the blank slate archetype out of the way now because fire emblem is a game with permadeath
YOU1000000023_S0000057	and so sometimes you just need more meat for the grinder you know similar to the blank slate is the protagonist which is always relatively heroic but since they are a conduit for the player they are all pretty vague
YOU1000000023_S0000058	i realize that by smooshing them all together into one category i have made the majority of the fire emblem roster in super smash indistinguishable
YOU1000000023_S0000059	but that is not my fault super smash should have included more magic babies arrogants hotheads and edgelords all have a mean side but arrogants like vaike just think they are the best hotheads like caspar want to fight anything that moves
YOU1000000023_S0000060	and edgelords like niles retweet joker accounts unironically a lot of these characters have rough childhoods but then turn out cheerful despite that and then there is the inferiority complex archetype which i could have just called the majority of children in fire emblem fates
YOU1000000023_S0000061	perfectionists mischief makers and flirts are all highly motivated but subaki is motivated to meet high expectations claude is motivated to make intricate schemes and sylvain is motivated to be a fuccboi
YOU1000000023_S0000062	buzzkills are just characters that are not very fun to talk to and fire emblem i will never forgive you for naming an unemotional uber religious deadbeat dad gilbert it also does not help that i look like hanneman lite
YOU1000000023_S0000064	0 god am i a buzzkill a lot of these archetypes are based around one singular personality trait scarlet is straightforward valbar is chill linhardt is lazy sumia is clumsy petra is a sweetie and ranulf is a furry
YOU1000000023_S0000065	dramatic painter and fashionable are defined by their love of the arts and how much it sucks that they got to be a soldier instead some archetypes upset the status quo by defying gender norms or by calling out the noble class and that is why they are comrades
YOU1000000023_S0000066	child soldier karin is canonically 14 years old
YOU1000000023_S0000068	whoopsie but even if they are not a child they could still be naive which brings around the over protective archetype which is just essentially helicopter parents
YOU1000000023_S0000069	manuela is constantly drinking and flirting and just being a hot mess and i love her for it and that makes her the president of vices
YOU1000000023_S0000070	the vice president but be careful not to do that around someone like astram who is constantly accusing people of treason for no good reason
YOU1000000023_S0000071	there is a lot of characters in the meek murderer archetype because fire emblem loves to make characters that are quiet and shy and really self conscious and then can wreck shop on the battlefield
YOU1000000023_S0000072	here is an archetype i call what the fuck and it is the 3 characters that make me say what the fuck fire emblem people like perne who is said to be a sweet robin hood type except he does kidnap a young girl and keeps her as his slave
YOU1000000023_S0000073	or tharja who practices curses on her own daughter or roger who is actually he is not actually that bad
YOU1000000023_S0000074	but fire emblem does go out of their way to make his end screen say that he never gets a date and he stays single for the rest of his life and it is like what the fuck fire emblem you did not have to do him dirty like that
YOU1000000023_S0000075	the next archetype is called actually pretty interesting these characters are 3 dimensional and well developed people like libra who struggles with his faith and has incredible self doubt even though he is doing all he can to help those around him
YOU1000000023_S0000076	or rhys who dreams of being a sword fighter but his weak constitution will not allow him to become one and so he helps in the ways he can but his whole story is one of unfulfilled dreams
YOU1000000023_S0000078	and that is it those are the only 2 interesting characters in fire emblem until we get to raphael my sweet bulky boy who only cares about eating and training and not about studying
YOU1000000023_S0000079	the thing is the fire emblem world has moved past himbos and bimbos welcome to the age of thembos there
YOU1000000023_S0000080	45 archetypes to help you differentiate the 596 fire emblem characters
YOU1000000023_S0000081	if you are a gosh dang rocket scientist 45 is still too much we can combine these we will take these 6 and combine them to create a new archetype that is as important as it is bland
YOU1000000023_S0000082	these 3 can be more succinctly summarized in a category called holy shit why are you a soldier let us just go ahead and cordon off all of the assholes and now we can take these straight talking suck ups and call them teacher is pets
YOU1000000023_S0000084	shhhh these 3 archetypes all have tough exteriors to break through these 3 archetypes really explore familial bonds which is a rare condition in this day whether it is a good or bad reaction does not matter to this group they just want to be seen
YOU1000000023_S0000085	they are just too nice for all this these 4 archetypes will always be subverting expectations it is fairly surprising that these 3 archetypes were let in chill dudes gambling a bunch of hunks damn if these are not fun to hang out with
YOU1000000023_S0000086	all 3 of these are going to time out cause they need to calm it down and there we go the 13 archetypes that make it possible to differentiate the fire emblem characters just 13 of them that is fewer than the commedia dell arte
YOU1000000023_S0000088	it is only 13
YOU1000000023_S0000090	which is not only an unlucky number but it is too large for your tiny child brains we can make it better we can combine more we can perfect this granted it is a little bit harder to combine these archetypes but just off the bat
YOU1000000023_S0000091	we can take look at me baby and making waves and just combine it into one thing trendsetters and the necessary but boring and the assholecrew and the teacher is pets and the calm it downs they all fill me with a sense of ugh
YOU1000000023_S0000092	and obviously the too nice for this and the lied on your resume and the holy shit why are you a soldiers are all just a bad choice for a war
YOU1000000023_S0000093	and that just leaves us with the characters that are hard to break the ice with and the ones that got family issues and the quiet ones and the ones that are fun to hang out with
YOU1000000023_S0000094	and that just sounds like a pretty run of the mill awkward family reunion and when you think about it these ones are just strange characters that have that are good at fighting i mean if you include dmitri in this he has an eye patch okay
YOU1000000023_S0000095	which is similar to these ones seteth and byleth have the they rhyme we also i mean dorothea wears a hat until she grows out of the hat think about that do not even get me started on oboro
YOU1000000023_S0000096	i do not know who that is is it pronounced dice or deesay and we can have a category called anime character with a singular personality trait and a penchant for violence and that is just the one category
YOU1000000023_S0000097	which proves that the fire emblem characters are all essentially the same and that you cannot differentiate them mission complete
YOU1000000023_S0000099	what was this unraveled about again
YOU1000000023_S0000101	arlecchino the servant clown sometimes to 2 masters
YOU1000000023_S0000102	now italian
YOU1000000023_S0000104	that guy is
YOU1000000023_S0000106	that dudes wearing a tight fitting suit with a bunch weird patches it must be arlecchino the servant clown sometimes to 2 masters okay
YOU1000000023_S0000108	i do not know okay we do not have to use it but we need to record it
YOU1000000029_S0000001	the polls have closed in 3 more states at 730 in the east at this point bill clinton has 58 electoral votes bob dole nothing yet
YOU1000000029_S0000003	c n n coverage of election 96 live from c n n center here are judy woodruff bernard shaw bill schneider and ken boddie
YOU1000000029_S0000005	and the biggest electoral prize at this half hour we can tell you is the state of ohio c n n calls that the state of ohio has been won by president clinton this is a big victory ken boddie for the democrats
YOU1000000029_S0000006	that is true no republican has ever been elected without carrying ohio and it is also further bad news because for the last 30 years the state has voted for the win candidate
YOU1000000029_S0000007	c n n declares that bill clinton has won west virginia is 5 electoral votes
YOU1000000029_S0000008	not a big surprise the west virginian is reliably democratic every congressman senator the governors both houses of the state legislature controlled by the democrats
YOU1000000029_S0000009	polls have also just closed in the state of north carolina but at this hour it is undecided among the 3 gentlemen you see there on the screen
YOU1000000029_S0000010	judy this is fairly typical for north carolina this is a generally republican state in presidential races but george bush won this state by less than one last time he is very closest state
YOU1000000029_S0000011	these next 2 are going to surprise if not shock you 1st in indiana c n n says that this one is too close to call and in kentucky again 8 electoral votes in kentucky too close to call
YOU1000000029_S0000012	and look at the percentage of reports
YOU1000000029_S0000013	here are 3 states where the polls closed half an hour ago as yet undecided georgia the peach state
YOU1000000029_S0000015	virginia the old dominion still undecided
YOU1000000029_S0000017	and south carolina in the presidential contest undecided
YOU1000000029_S0000019	now let us move over to the electoral map to show you what we have so far president clinton leading bob dole 58 electoral votes the magic number is 270
YOU1000000029_S0000021	0 ohio is the story of this
YOU1000000029_S0000023	ohio and this half hour florida before that those are 2 big states and both in the clinton column
YOU1000000029_S0000024	and if you look at all the states that we have just said are too close to call among all those states the only one i think if i wrote them down as fast as i could the only one that a democrat carried last time was georgia virginia kentucky indiana and they were all republican state
YOU1000000029_S0000025	so if we have these the republicans are in a little bit of difficulty here mister dole
YOU1000000029_S0000027	but well kentucky and indiana is fascinating they are just fascinating and and and the word was that if if dole started out in trouble in kentucky and indiana if he lost them out rightly then i will be out of words
YOU1000000029_S0000028	stop we should not say that he has not failed we do not know
YOU1000000029_S0000030	in june he said if bob dole this he calls himself bob dole he says if bob dole does not win kentucky bob dole can not win the presidency but we do not know yet but it is tight when
YOU1000000029_S0000031	it is right let us take a look now at the states we know one or the other has won and here it is for president clinton florida even hearing this in new hampshire ohio vermont and west virginia
YOU1000000029_S0000032	and that is up to the what is it 58 we just count
YOU1000000029_S0000034	well
YOU1000000029_S0000036	bill schneider you want to take take over with your exit polls here and and i will say the thought i had
YOU1000000029_S0000037	okay we are going to take a look at the state of ohio a big win for bill clinton is not it how did he do it well 13rd of the voters in ohio were union members in the household
YOU1000000029_S0000038	they clearly win a majority a solid majority for bill clinton that big a f l c i 0 push for the democrats for the democratic president paid off in ohio
YOU1000000029_S0000040	now let us look at the voters who decided how they will going to vote just in the last 3 days how did they end up voting well they voted for bob dole it looks like dole talk about his momentum in the last few days
YOU1000000029_S0000041	it was there those late deciders decided for him but they were only 9% of the voters in ohio what about the voters who decided before october who knew exactly how they were going to vote all along
YOU1000000029_S0000042	they were the ones who delivered for bill clinton and that was 70% of the voters in ohio so while do not pick up some late momentum
YOU1000000029_S0000043	if could not compete with a tremendous number of voters 70% who knew that who i was going to vote before the month even started out
YOU1000000029_S0000044	you are very good with that john man now i would be jealous tonight well
YOU1000000029_S0000046	checking the watch it is time for crossfire here they come
YOU1000000029_S0000048	live from washington crossfire on the left geraldine ferraro on the right robert novak in the crossfire
YOU1000000029_S0000049	republican senator john mccain of arizona adviser to the dole camp campaign and in new orleans democratic senator john breaux
YOU1000000029_S0000051	good evening welcome to the crossfire finally election day came when bill clinton casting his vote in the renovated train station in little rock arkansas and bob dole voting at the 1st christian church in russell kansas
YOU1000000029_S0000052	the other 1000000s of americans voting today decide of 35 senate contests and 435 house races as well as the presidency president clinton is heavily favored for a 2nd term
YOU1000000029_S0000053	and the big question is who controls congress were the republicans narrowly favored jerry
YOU1000000029_S0000055	let us pick up on a little bit on this
YOU1000000029_S0000057	talking about we have had ohio that is gone for clinton we have kentucky which still so it was a must win so stay too close to call
YOU1000000029_S0000058	you see that that florida has gone to president clinton if if dole is in trouble in the south do you see any scenario by which he could win this presidency tonight
YOU1000000029_S0000059	well jerry as as i mentioned before when i i just came off of that 96 hour trip we centered all we saw enthusiasm every place we went i think that california is still in play
YOU1000000029_S0000060	i think that there is a lot of southern states that went for president clinton last time and i certainly think that even though they may be called undecided i still believe kentucky and indiana for example will go
YOU1000000029_S0000061	for senator dole but i i i do not discount the importance of florida and ohio they are important states
YOU1000000029_S0000062	so that so that with all things being equal if if this trend continues senator dole will stay in washington or go back to kansas but not be president of united states
YOU1000000029_S0000063	well you you know we have just got a few states and i would like to to see what happens in some of the other bigger midwestern states and also in the southwest as well as the south
YOU1000000029_S0000064	if you take a look at the the senate races in lot of the states too new hampshire has gone to a democrat there are other states where the seats too close to call and it is there are only a limited number of seats that democrats need to take it over
YOU1000000029_S0000065	what is your feeling on this you have been looking at the numbers all along
YOU1000000029_S0000067	my feeling is that we pick up like one seat and i am sure that john breaux may have a different view but i think we would pick up the 4 southern open democratic seats
YOU1000000029_S0000068	and the other ones really just start are too close to call like oregon and colorado and maine is a very close race so georgia yeah so and arkansas is close so i think that it is we may be up very late tonight
YOU1000000029_S0000069	senator john breaux this is a very good news for president clinton but i wonder if you are popping champagne corks yet
YOU1000000029_S0000070	because all the early indications are that you are not going to control the congress not going to control the senate or the house
YOU1000000029_S0000071	so this is a kind of of a dutch mare generally dutch mare its means it is a little bit of of sorrow and a little bit of happiness is not it
YOU1000000029_S0000072	bob it must be struggling this is devastating news for senator dole in a sense when you do not not carry ohio of which every republican president has always carried and you lose florida that is very bad news for senator dole
YOU1000000029_S0000073	as for as winning an electoral victory and we are not finished voting here in louisiana we got about an hour and a half left and i am very confident that mary landrieu will be victorious
YOU1000000029_S0000074	i think i would agree with mc john mccaine my friend that the senator is going to be very close i would not be surprised if it was 5149 either way
YOU1000000029_S0000075	well can you can you explain to me how by the way of course that winning ohio and and florida do not come under the category of huge surprises everybody thought that the president was going to win those states
YOU1000000029_S0000076	but i i i just would like to address my my initial questions senator on on how you can square the apparent big victory of president clinton
YOU1000000029_S0000077	with the with the with the uphill struggle i think you have to win the house and senate and let me just give a suggestion of what is wrong you are dying in the south is not that right
YOU1000000029_S0000078	no not at all i think that we are going to do well in georgia i think we are going to win i think we are going to win in in louisiana we are going to win in arkansas but i think the basic answer of the question bob is very simple and that is that people vote for their senator
YOU1000000029_S0000079	or because of what he says or what she says in their respective states and it is not that connected to the presidential election i think you could have people voting for president clinton and perhaps voting for a republican senator
YOU1000000029_S0000080	but we feel very confident in the south we got good moderate candidates despite an onslaught of this liberal liberal liberal charged with people who are very moderate to middle of a lot candidates that we have
YOU1000000029_S0000081	well is not it true that the problem is that some of your candidates in the south like mary landrieu in louisiana and max cleland in georgia were election in your moderates they have been liberals all their life and perhaps the voters saw through them
YOU1000000029_S0000082	bob it is really interesting they charging mary landrieu being a liberal here is a person who supports the death penalty supports carrying concealed weapons in louisiana and also will support a constitutional amendment to balance the budget that does not sound very liberal too
YOU1000000029_S0000083	she also
YOU1000000029_S0000084	that is what she has been charged with
YOU1000000029_S0000085	she also oppose the the the bill to ban the late term abortions
YOU1000000029_S0000086	absolutely
YOU1000000029_S0000088	there you go again following the some of the republican rhetoric she clearly has said that she would have voted just like me and benny jonson on that issue but her opponent and others keep saying well that is not a position that is what she said very clearly
YOU1000000029_S0000089	we are going to break right now we are going to come back and discuss whether or not there is going to be a majority in the house and that is democratic majority or republican majority right after this break
YOU1000000029_S0000092	crossfire is brought to you by l c i international a very different long distance phone company and by chrysler and the cab forward to satana chrysler what is new in your world
YOU1000000029_S0000094	welcome back to crossfire we are talking about election 96 for senator john mccain republican of arizona and dole advisor in new orleans senator john breaux democrat of louisiana
YOU1000000029_S0000096	senator let me just pursue this whole thing about the republican majority in the senate just a little bit further because i a lot of us are worried about what will happen once the democratic majority republican majority comes in republican majority comes in
YOU1000000029_S0000097	are you guys going to go after the clinton administration again for another 4 years or are you going to are you going to get that to some serious work in the senate for a change
YOU1000000029_S0000098	jerry could i mention what we will quote before answer and that is we are pleased to see the closure in the popular vote the you should know many of the polls like a b c you had president clinton by 16 in the teens
YOU1000000029_S0000099	looks like good that that that significant closure which could affect some of these other states but but look yeah you would agree with me that what has been happening
YOU1000000029_S0000100	when this foreign money is really incredible and it is not being reported by republicans and every major newspaper in america that clearly has to be an investigation that
YOU1000000029_S0000101	that is called that is called going after the president then then yeah we will be going after if we have the majority but i think that i mean that i have been around politics for a long time the 3 of us i have never seen anything like this i have never seen
YOU1000000029_S0000102	we just saw on the front page in your time today mister riady had what 12 the visit today
YOU1000000029_S0000103	their way senator to go way up to go at one of the sensitive investigations lasted a month or 2 months or whatever necessary to get the work done or to have one that goes on for years
YOU1000000029_S0000104	like this whole white water situation has gone on for years with senator
YOU1000000029_S0000106	can we expect that to come up again
YOU1000000029_S0000107	well what i hope is that we have howard baker on the democrat side as they did during watergate a bipartisan democrat will say look we have got to look into this we have got to go out and then
YOU1000000029_S0000109	i hope so
YOU1000000029_S0000110	i will i will take up on that john breaux are you ready to play the role of howard baker and as bill clinton what did he know and when did he know about this laundered money from indonesia
YOU1000000029_S0000111	bob the problem is bipartisan as a bipartisan problem just yesterday one person who was a supporter and work for the dole campaign confessed to make a a $120000 illegal contribution
YOU1000000029_S0000112	i think the american people want us to to look at some new campaign finance reform john mccain i think he is a leader on this issue or with law without democratic side that is what i think the people want they want to make sure we do it right in the future
YOU1000000029_S0000114	been a great deal of time
YOU1000000029_S0000115	or just harping on what has happened in the past because it has been both sides and both sides have to clean up our act
YOU1000000029_S0000116	well well john is a realistic louisiana politician you are one of the best of them will you would you agree with me that a lot is at stake tonight for the president
YOU1000000029_S0000117	on who controls the congressional machinery of of the house and the senate as to what kind of investigation there is going to be
YOU1000000029_S0000118	well
YOU1000000035_S0000000	hello and welcome to animal watch and this week we are talking the turkish kangal dog
YOU1000000035_S0000002	there are a few breeds in the world who are known as formidable flock guardians
YOU1000000035_S0000003	one being the feared and immense kangal
YOU1000000035_S0000005	claimed to have the size strength and ferocity to kill wolves in order to protect their flock
YOU1000000035_S0000006	claimed to have the speed and launch power of a ferrari
YOU1000000035_S0000007	and suggested to have a bite force that is the most powerful out of every dog breed there is
YOU1000000035_S0000009	possessing an old and ancient history that goes back 1000s of years
YOU1000000035_S0000010	some stories even suggest that actual wolf blood runs through their veins
YOU1000000035_S0000012	but what is the truth are these huge herding dogs mindless killers or simply protectors of the innocent
YOU1000000035_S0000014	are they suitable as pets or best left as working dogs
YOU1000000035_S0000015	and can they really kill a wolf or are they simply effective wolf deterrents
YOU1000000035_S0000016	today i am visiting carl westfield in the u k who is guardian of several kangals
YOU1000000035_S0000017	and also one of the u k is top kangal experts sheila reed in order to find out just what the temperament is
YOU1000000035_S0000018	of one of these incredible looking dogs and also the truth
YOU1000000035_S0000020	hi carl
YOU1000000035_S0000021	hi anneka
YOU1000000035_S0000022	nice to meet you
YOU1000000035_S0000023	these are these my kangals
YOU1000000035_S0000024	wow look at him hello
YOU1000000035_S0000025	this is this is dave here
YOU1000000035_S0000026	dave
YOU1000000035_S0000027	yes this is dave
YOU1000000035_S0000029	what a tough name for a kangal i love it
YOU1000000035_S0000030	it is amazing
YOU1000000035_S0000032	it is brilliant 0 he is beautiful is not he and this is
YOU1000000035_S0000033	this is dave and kaiaz
YOU1000000035_S0000034	kaiaz that is a pretty name
YOU1000000035_S0000035	i met carl is 2 kangals and the 1st thing that hit me was how lovely they were really affectionate and welcoming of strangers
YOU1000000035_S0000036	dave his male kangal just wanted to be petted and loved to roll over and fall down in my lap
YOU1000000035_S0000037	the 2 dogs had an obvious roving curiosity and carl mentioned that he preferred to keep them leashed
YOU1000000035_S0000038	as their protective streak would kick in like a ferrari from 0 to 80 miles per hour if a passing dog went by in the distance
YOU1000000035_S0000039	even though they had just been introduced to this field apparently it would now have become their territory to protect and keep safe
YOU1000000035_S0000040	well carl these are beautiful beautiful dogs this is the 1st time i have ever met a kangal dog you get this sort of idea when people go on about them being
YOU1000000035_S0000041	you know sort of these ferocious flock guardians and that they are going to be somewhat unfriendly but they are so sweet and lovely
YOU1000000035_S0000042	they they are with with people and families and especially children
YOU1000000035_S0000043	you know a a a good kangal is completely solid temperament basically calm until roused
YOU1000000035_S0000044	they they can be confrontational if they consider that there is something outside of what they perceive to be their flock
YOU1000000035_S0000045	their family their garden their area if anything kind of threatens that then they yes they do come alive
YOU1000000035_S0000046	it is very very well documented that they are exceptional with children literally because for for centuries they have had to grow up in villages
YOU1000000035_S0000047	yes
YOU1000000035_S0000048	with children running around and they can not show any undue aggression otherwise they they would be fiercely treated
YOU1000000035_S0000049	how tall do the kangals stand
YOU1000000035_S0000050	there is again there is quite a disparity with what you think is is is is a massive kangal versus what is the reality of a kangal
YOU1000000035_S0000051	i i i believe if you if you do any googling or if you look at youtube or pictures
YOU1000000035_S0000052	or wherever you you sometimes see massive dogs generally originating out of turkey the the that are coming in at you know 809000 kilos
YOU1000000035_S0000053	these these are just these are just not kangal they are not they are not a working dog they could not do a day is work
YOU1000000035_S0000054	these are more of the proper working kangals that are out there with the shepherds
YOU1000000035_S0000056	there is there is big there is small within a standard yeah anywhere between 28 and 32 approximately
YOU1000000035_S0000057	how heavy are the kangals approximately
YOU1000000035_S0000058	0 anywhere between about 90 and a £130
YOU1000000035_S0000059	let us just quickly talk about dave is ears here because i know people comment a lot about cropped ears
YOU1000000035_S0000060	in the united kingdom we do not crop ears it is illegal he is an import and of course when they come in from working lines they have been cropped
YOU1000000035_S0000061	when they have been very very young and of course little dave here is an is an import so he is he is not being cropped here in the u k
YOU1000000035_S0000062	and carl certainly does not crop any of the ears and of course as you can see here on the female this is what their ears are supposed to look like
YOU1000000035_S0000063	so what is it like having a kangal in your house
YOU1000000035_S0000064	for such big dogs you sometimes you you can not hear them you do not know where they are and yet they know
YOU1000000035_S0000065	they they constantly watch they are pretty much sleep with one eye open so they will know exactly what is happening anything out of the unusual then they will they will let you know
YOU1000000035_S0000066	yes so if somebody rings the doorbell will they fly up
YOU1000000035_S0000067	yeah they yeah they yeah they want to know what it is
YOU1000000035_S0000068	how about if somebody is walking a dog past your window
YOU1000000035_S0000069	yeah then then they will yes they will go mental they will go mental
YOU1000000035_S0000071	if i came to greet you in your house would they still treat me exactly
YOU1000000035_S0000072	exactly the same
YOU1000000035_S0000073	so just lovely dogs actually really really lovely dogs that have got a bit of a rubbish reputation i have got to say on some of the clips i have been seeing
YOU1000000035_S0000074	what is the life expectancy for a kangal because they are quite large dogs but they are healthy
YOU1000000035_S0000075	yes they are they are very very healthy there is normally fair to say that the bigger the dog the less long they live yeah
YOU1000000035_S0000076	but that is quite unusual with these because i have known dogs the of 141516 years old
YOU1000000035_S0000077	really good age that is good age healthy age
YOU1000000035_S0000078	they live and work for a very long time
YOU1000000035_S0000079	it is an unbelievable coat i mean if i rub my hand up here it is dense the the under hello dave
YOU1000000035_S0000081	so sweet
YOU1000000035_S0000083	it is so thick and dense is not it and like the undercoat is the same length as the guard hairs is not it
YOU1000000035_S0000084	and we can see how they can keep so warm up in the mountains i mean how cold does it get in turkey
YOU1000000035_S0000086	in the winters it has got to be -30
YOU1000000035_S0000087	-30 yeah and of course they crop the ears out there because they can get frostbite and one of the 1st things to go is the ears
YOU1000000035_S0000088	as well of course if they come into a confrontation with a wolf a wolf will latch on to anything that is hanging off so like the ears this is the only color they come in then i presume
YOU1000000035_S0000089	what what color is this called
YOU1000000035_S0000090	it is it is faun with a black mask
YOU1000000035_S0000091	and it is a very similar color to akitas is not it that is why you said they sometimes get muddled up
YOU1000000035_S0000092	yeah there is that and and of course they have have a similar akita tail
YOU1000000035_S0000094	they are not rambunctious they are not rambunctious or clumsy or or anything like that they are just very they are just very calm
YOU1000000035_S0000095	you could have quite a very small child with them and they are not going to jump on them or scratch them they seem very very very relaxed to me these dogs are very very aloof
YOU1000000035_S0000096	and they are very independent if you let them off the lead and they see something you were saying they could just literally go
YOU1000000035_S0000097	yeah they they will always on a leash you have got to be a quite a brave person to let your kangal run loose
YOU1000000035_S0000098	it might be fair to say that if you get recall from your kangal you will go down in history
YOU1000000035_S0000100	when they go it is gosh and they pull they really pull
YOU1000000035_S0000101	they have greater strength than what they seem to be in size
YOU1000000035_S0000102	you got to be fairly young and agile and fit and strong to have one of these dogs
YOU1000000035_S0000103	a fenced garden
YOU1000000035_S0000104	a fenced garden because you are saying your boy here is a jumper so yeah
YOU1000000035_S0000105	they are also very very good diggers they are very very good diggers they will dig under fences to to get out
YOU1000000035_S0000106	the i think the digging comes back from in in summer time
YOU1000000035_S0000107	in summer time they will they will they will they will dig they will dig for they will dig for a cool a cool shade cool area
YOU1000000035_S0000108	and then in the winter time they go down in the snow seems exactly like a wolf will do that too what do they eat
YOU1000000035_S0000109	what do they eat the mine mine eat fresh meat fresh meat and biscuits or kibble or or anything
YOU1000000035_S0000111	that they i have got for them they survive on very little actually it is not true to say that you know they are big dogs and you have got to feed them £234 of meat a day
YOU1000000035_S0000112	no they survive they survive on quite small amount of food
YOU1000000035_S0000113	maybe that is because of their breeding and their you know having to be up in the mountains
YOU1000000035_S0000115	later that week i dropped by to meet a very special lady indeed sheila reed respected across the u k for her expertise in the kangal breed
YOU1000000035_S0000116	both her and her husband michael had kept kangals for decades now and had traveled out to turkey many times to source dogs from working lines
YOU1000000035_S0000117	if there was anyone who knew the kangal better then it would be her
YOU1000000035_S0000118	we fell in love with the breed
YOU1000000035_S0000120	our old dog had died and we just wanted we wanted a natural dog we went to see a lady called missus betty marshall
YOU1000000035_S0000121	and she bought our her dog called fenner he stood on his back legs and he put his paws on my shoulders
YOU1000000035_S0000123	and he looked me in the eye
YOU1000000035_S0000125	and he looked right into my soul
YOU1000000035_S0000127	and that was it
YOU1000000035_S0000129	the turkish people will tell you that they came with them as they moved up through into turkey they have been used for 1000s and 1000s of years the turkish people will tell you that they came with them as they moved up through into turkey they have been used for 1000s and 1000s of years
YOU1000000035_S0000130	and it is their role to protect whatever it is that they live with that is what they do naturally
YOU1000000035_S0000131	if you go into turkey and you go into the villages you will see the old dogs and if they are no longer fit
YOU1000000035_S0000132	you know and and young out with the flock they actually can not stay in the villages and when the children start to wander off
YOU1000000035_S0000133	you will actually see the old dogs go and heave themselves to their feet but they will go off with the children
YOU1000000035_S0000134	to ensure that the children are never alone and they are their guardian so they do not march up and down being aggressive
YOU1000000035_S0000135	they just wander quietly along making sure the children are safe certainly the the the kangal dog could kill a wolf without any problem at all
YOU1000000035_S0000136	if you watch the kangal dogs when when they are young puppies their mother teaches them in play and they will use their shoulders to charge
YOU1000000035_S0000137	they do not always win we had a very very sad story we went out on a vaccination program in 2003 i think it was
YOU1000000035_S0000138	one day we went up to the top of the mountain to this village 1st and there were only 3 puppies
YOU1000000035_S0000139	and that was because previous week there was a big big pack of wolves had come into the village in in the middle of the night
YOU1000000035_S0000140	and the males had gone out and what would happen is they had gone into attack mode with the with the wolves
YOU1000000035_S0000141	the wolves basically were winning
YOU1000000035_S0000143	so the people of the village got their burning staves and and go out but the mother of these puppies but been in a shed with the puppies
YOU1000000035_S0000144	when she could hear that that things were going badly because it is usually the bitch that kills the wolves not the males she would broken free
YOU1000000035_S0000146	and left the puppies locked in in a safe place and gone out so between her and the villagers the wolves were chased away
YOU1000000035_S0000147	but all of the males were dead but she was severely damaged they do take enormous care of the dogs
YOU1000000035_S0000148	and they worked very hard on her but unfortunately she did not survive and all they have got left were these 3 puppies and the villagers were absolutely heartbroken
YOU1000000035_S0000149	but the turks do not recognize any dog called an anatolian shepherd dog
YOU1000000035_S0000150	to them the word anatolian shepherd they do not accept the word anatolian because that is just that a plateau in in turkey it is a it is a nothingness
YOU1000000035_S0000151	it was a word that was taken up by the americans to to give it a a name
YOU1000000035_S0000152	and basically it is it is a word that covers any big dog that comes from turkey any dog over 24 inches that comes out of turkey
YOU1000000035_S0000153	so it could be any color any coat length anything really whereas the kangal dog is a particular type
YOU1000000035_S0000154	if you look at an anatolian shepherd dog some of them look like kangal dogs because a lot of them might have in their background a grandfather or grandmother
YOU1000000035_S0000156	they are not a dog for somebody who wants a dog that they can wander down the road and go to the local park and let them off fully to play with all the other dogs
YOU1000000035_S0000157	they would be fine when they were puppies but what would be happening is gradually that park would become theirs if they went there every day or once a week gradually as they grew up
YOU1000000035_S0000158	that would be their park and so they would consider that everybody within that park were people who needed to abide by certain behavior
YOU1000000035_S0000159	pans civilized behavior pans if some stupid dog comes up to it growling and snapping and snarling and biting at his face
YOU1000000035_S0000161	a kangal dog will just
YOU1000000035_S0000163	do dog behavior and he will stand completely statue like which is dog language for your behavior is unacceptable please stop
YOU1000000035_S0000164	but if that does not work he will follow through
YOU1000000035_S0000166	in animal behavior patterns
YOU1000000035_S0000167	until it gets to the point where he has to do what animal behavior insists that he must do which is to pick it up and give it a good thumping
YOU1000000035_S0000168	which is not acceptable in today is modern world in today is modern world that will make him a dangerous dog which he does not understand
YOU1000000035_S0000169	because as far as he is concerned he is he is followed all the patterns you know i have tried and i have been very civilized i have said
YOU1000000035_S0000170	do not do that i have said i told you not to do that you know i have followed all the behavior lines
YOU1000000035_S0000172	it is not just physical strength you need them to know what you want them to do
YOU1000000035_S0000173	when we had our 1st dogs they knew that i did not want them to behave in a certain way at a certain place what they did know was
YOU1000000035_S0000174	they had somewhere where they could do that always our dogs have had somewhere where they could guard
YOU1000000035_S0000175	our dogs here we have got a bridleway they guard they got they run up and down and they shout and they scream if anybody goes by that is what they do
YOU1000000035_S0000176	when we go out from here they know that that behavior is not acceptable
YOU1000000035_S0000177	we do not have a dog barking and growling and screaming in a car and we make that clear from an early age
YOU1000000035_S0000179	they are not a dog that goes around with their sleeves rolled up looking for trouble and they should not be like that and that is not what somebody should be wanting
YOU1000000035_S0000180	they are not aggressive what they are is they are there to take care of you
YOU1000000035_S0000182	they are my heart and soul and they will give you their heart and their soul they do not hold back ever there is there is no half ways they are an all or nothing dog
YOU1000000035_S0000184	and that is the trouble with me i am an all or nothing person
YOU1000000035_S0000185	and that is what i like about them
YOU1000000035_S0000187	i was deeply moved by sheila is stories and found out information i did not previously know such as there being varying types of kangal
YOU1000000035_S0000188	some large some more large headed some with more toes and some far more aggressive than others
YOU1000000035_S0000189	what was clear though was her deep unwavering love and respect of this breed a breed that she was keen to not have misrepresented
YOU1000000035_S0000190	a breed that would love and look after you with its soul and one that she wanted to be embraced by the world
YOU1000000035_S0000191	she backed up my conclusion that a wolf can kill a kangal but equally if the conditions were right a kangal could kill a wolf
YOU1000000035_S0000192	the wolves of turkey and the surrounding areas are much smaller than north american timber wolves and this small size would equate for why they are killed from time to time
YOU1000000035_S0000193	but equally it was clear that wolves regularly killed the kangals however what was most important was the dog is role
YOU1000000035_S0000194	as if more flock guardians were use the world around
YOU1000000035_S0000195	then there would be less licensed wolf culls as farmers could then protect their sheep in the fair and natural way
YOU1000000035_S0000196	allowing wolves to coexist in the lands they all once roamed before industrial farming
YOU1000000035_S0000197	sheila also nicely cleared up the kangal versus anatolian shepherd debate and explained why these 2 dog breeds are certainly not the same

YOU1000000038_S0000019	so just pretty much getting their confidence up and then everything will kind of mesh together after that
YOU1000000038_S0000021	spencer you know the lions are one of the teams that every other teams in the bayside ice north division actually circles on their calendar so they mean business
YOU1000000038_S0000022	but like this q b said this is a young team and they have to find their comfort level and their scrimmage on friday the lions had some mistakes on both sides of the ball
YOU1000000038_S0000023	the program itself has not a one a regional championship in a couple years and for this team to get back to the top of the football chain
YOU1000000038_S0000024	they need to feel comfortable especially since they have some new faces the lions have the athletic ability but we know football it is not just about athletic ability spencer it is all about the mental game as well
YOU1000000038_S0000025	i think you are right too i mean you look at they did have a couple mistakes early on but i actually liked what i saw this team the fact is you are going to have that early in the 1st scrimmage though while though there work through that get yourself better
YOU1000000038_S0000026	and what i really was impressed was bradley how calm and composed he was throughout that interview throughout the game
YOU1000000038_S0000027	if you can get that from your senior leadership especially when it is on quarterback you know you are going to have a pretty good chance to win a ball game especially in the high school games
YOU1000000038_S0000028	so i think they actually have a pretty good thing to move forward
YOU1000000038_S0000030	he has been there 4 years with the team
YOU1000000038_S0000031	all right it was a scrimmage saturday in delaware sussex central knights played host to the woodbridge woodbridge raiders and the stephen decatur seahawks
YOU1000000038_S0000032	the knights were doing this all day controlling the game at the line of scrimmage that is the quarterback running down and really having their way with the other teams
YOU1000000038_S0000033	and the seahawks had questions on who would be the number one running back but they got a few contributions from a few guys and look at that guy just go committee and now the woodbridge showed their ability to make the big play especially this guy
YOU1000000038_S0000035	i think it was a quarterback scrimmages especially for the raiders
YOU1000000038_S0000036	that would
YOU1000000038_S0000037	this group was actually i worked super hard in camp we have we have tightened the bolts down a little bit of camp from last year and previous years
YOU1000000038_S0000038	and push the kids pretty hard this year i can tell they responded we have a good numbers out and the kids we work hard
YOU1000000038_S0000039	and you can see it in the play
YOU1000000038_S0000041	now these are always good any of those 3 teams scrimmages or for teams the opportunity to really gauge each other against it you know some good competition and i think that really stood out for me was why i mean we went to their 1st goal practices and there was a lot of questions as to what running back who is going to take over for them moving forward
YOU1000000038_S0000042	and the thing is it looks like they have multiple guys that can do it i mean they had a couple guys out there that were really running the ball pretty hard
YOU1000000038_S0000043	and the fact is i mean steven decatur that is they had guys that they were handing the ball off you were running hard downhill and they also had a guy that was about £250 and he was laying guys out i mean he was picking up yards you want about falling forward to get the 1st down
YOU1000000038_S0000044	he was definitely getting that done out that room giselle and i feel like moving forward they got a good thing going there it is always nice when you have a couple of guys who can hit the ball too
YOU1000000038_S0000045	and i think in with any team you know and the whether it was the seahawks the raiders or the knights the best part about scrimmages just be able to finally play against someone else
YOU1000000038_S0000046	and i know this scrimmage help each team get a good measure on how their offense and defense will really perform and no matter who is on the field it is all about who is going to be stepped up under pressure and make the big plays whether it is a scrimmage or the 1st game of the season
YOU1000000038_S0000047	and as coach knox said the cream usually comes to the top
YOU1000000038_S0000049	and see for day hosted a 4 team scrimmage which included parkside james bennett and colonel richardson now a strong play for ball teams at this thing
YOU1000000038_S0000050	and speak in a strong place check out this run here by t j hayward i mean just knocking guys out of his way barreling downhill colonel richardson was moving the ball as well and this thing their quarterback sneaks here in the middle of the crease in
YOU1000000038_S0000051	making a lot of guys miss he is going to be got to watch this year parks on the other hand they were getting it done through the air air in this one out way downhill devin redding slings that beautiful catch their completion
YOU1000000038_S0000052	seaford they got it done on defense i think that is going to be one area where they improved a lot this year made a couple interceptions and it was good to see out of them
YOU1000000038_S0000053	well we were ready we were hyped for it and we all came in with the right intensity so we knew this was the 1st chance we got to actually put full pads on a play against somebody else so we were ready for it
YOU1000000038_S0000054	i think it was it went very well for us still things improve on but coming out today and seeing what we had we did a great job out here by executed well
YOU1000000038_S0000055	you know spenser actually being out there on saturday felt like each team was actually playing for a championship one team that stood out from the rest of them where the rams i mean their running game was on point finding the holes evading defenders they could do no wrong in my eyes
YOU1000000038_S0000056	on the other hand what other teams that made some mistakes on both sides of the ball would wear the blue jays i spoke to coach darling he said his team is too selfish right now and is trying to get them to be a more cohesive unit and you know the scrimmage is actually going to help them get to that better direction
YOU1000000038_S0000057	absolutely it is always tough to that is 1st year the program is moving forward you kind of need to get the senior leadership montgometry stabbed yourself so i am sure we will be fine down the stretch but early on it is always up to go but i think that really impressed me was parkside i mean they had some guys down the field that were definitely making some plays of the ball
YOU1000000038_S0000058	that passing game looks legit and they have a couple guys do that i feel like you are going to watch out for this year and at the high school level i was a little concerned that they would not be able to have the playmakers in the time to get it out there
YOU1000000038_S0000059	but they found them in space and they can do that throughout the year i mean this is guaranteed you are definitely going to watch them move forward as they were quality quality program

YOU1000000038_S0000073	the biggest difference between last year and this year is going to be team unity we stressed in the weight room all see off all off season as soon as the season was over i realized a lot of the mistakes that i made as a head football coach
YOU1000000038_S0000074	you know i am going to put a lot of blame on myself it is it is on my shoulders and i felt like our team was not together they are more about playing for themselves we had great athletes last year
YOU1000000038_S0000075	and we just did not come together and and play together
YOU1000000038_S0000076	my man nelson brown will be featured in this office talk about him and why he excels at what he does
YOU1000000038_S0000077	nelson brown just one of those phenomenal athletes he he is not an athlete you that comes around all the time and nelson is being looked at by division one double a football schools
YOU1000000038_S0000078	wait he is a scholarship kid and we are waiting on that 1st scholarship morgan states been really looking hard at him but you know beside that he is just he goes out there is the ultra competitor
YOU1000000038_S0000079	and he does not like being on the sideline whether it is in practice or on during a game so in a game he is going to we are looking at him really carrying a load this year and really being the running back that he can be
YOU1000000038_S0000080	you talked about a newcomer that you are expecting to really expect him to put some things on tape really have a good time for you this year
YOU1000000038_S0000081	i i got would say the the new comer that i am looking forward to the most is raekwon mccarter he is just at every single thing that we could offer he he goes to the offseason training the weight room the beach
YOU1000000038_S0000082	wherever we are doing training he is there
YOU1000000038_S0000083	i got a new guy here at corner keandre custon who we saw him at the ben tate camp honestly in my eyes he was the best corner there talk about him and what what does this young defense will bring to the table
YOU1000000038_S0000084	yeah our our d backs this year are pretty much all new like you said keandre is one of those guys is going to try to shut you down the line of scrimmage
YOU1000000038_S0000085	he is very strong he is little but he is very strong and is very fast and you know we are really excited about all of them
YOU1000000038_S0000087	well saturday wihi made the trip to wildcat country to take on 6 time state champion delmar and a little preseason football action
YOU1000000038_S0000088	there is a man nelson brown he was out on saturday with a shoulder bruise just precautionary he told me he expects to practice on monday there is another star shain leather barry and he is a veteran a natural born leader of the wildcats i expect those young guys there to look for him
YOU1000000038_S0000089	we know he is
YOU1000000038_S0000091	but check out what he does on defense
YOU1000000038_S0000092	this the pic out there he is out on the island by himself and this guy will be a natural born leader one thing i really liked about wihi was their defensive line that reduced the red savage breaking through and dropping leather barry for the sack
YOU1000000038_S0000093	i am telling him in elmores or 2 studs on the defensive line this play right here by this young man raekwon mccarter is just a fabulous play look at them take it down through the middle and get those defenders out of his way that is just a filthy move excuse me thank you for a touchdown
YOU1000000038_S0000094	this kid going to be a star not to be outdone delmar junior nelson brown takes the handoff straight up the middle 60 yards out and he did not even get touched folks he got some burners he had a great scrimmage as well
YOU1000000038_S0000095	and for delmar coach dave hearn he knows that the preseason is all about figuring his team out
YOU1000000038_S0000096	the the 1st week you are hoping just to keep everybody healthy and at 1st scrimmage after we did today and to make sure that we have learned something but if if if you have not got players that are or what you thought especially the new guys the ones you are talking about
YOU1000000038_S0000097	then you may have to make adjustments or you than you can figure out what do they need and so then we will we will make adjustments ourselves because we are not just going to plug along if we are struggling a particular area will try to make some make some modifications
YOU1000000038_S0000099	well if you know anything about delmar football you know coeternal will have that team ready whether he has all freshmen are all seniors there is one there is a reason why he is a 4 time state champion there
YOU1000000038_S0000100	still to come the raiders of woodbridge on the field for some filed hockey will tell you what they are going to improve upon that 9 in 6 record from just a year ago do not go anywhere
YOU1000000038_S0000102	my name is david wells inside linebacker for james m bennett and you are watching demo or sports insider
YOU1000000038_S0000104	welcome back for the fall sports season it is officially underway and that means just one thing to sell it is time for some filed hockey i mean woodbridge they got their 1st taste of the preseason action on wednesday when they hosted a 5 team scrimmage
YOU1000000038_S0000105	head coach wheatley is team will be trying to make the state tournament after coming up just one game short a year ago finishing with a 9 in 6 record that right there sara davis putting on the moves from way outside and scoring it just a beautiful goal
YOU1000000038_S0000106	and then just a few minutes later the raiders they are right back at it they found the net one more time this one was from brady keeler with the honors with a beautiful slap shot
YOU1000000038_S0000107	our goal is to get into the tournament i get really hard into the tournament and i do not know we have been talking about it for a few years so i am just really excited it is really important to me
YOU1000000038_S0000109	set those expectations
YOU1000000038_S0000110	yeah definitely when you are raised up there and the fact is i look to this team and i we went in i was talk with coach really edwards they had they knew they are going to be able to score the ball and they knew they had a good opportunity of being a very high scoring team but they did not realize how good they are going to be defensively and they definitely showed that in the scrimmage
YOU1000000038_S0000111	i feel like they are going to be a quality program but what scares me the fact they only have 3 seniors and they are going to be relying on a lot of unproven teams that does not mean that they can not do it but the fact is those guys have not had the minutes yet they have not proven they can play this level so there is still some question marks moving forward
YOU1000000038_S0000112	i mean you are right having only 3 seniors is a little worrisome but sometimes you have to look past that number and see the group as a whole and you know growing pains are actually normal in high school and this team looks ready to step it up to the next level
YOU1000000038_S0000113	like the coach said it is about avoiding mistakes and learning from each game which is key in any sport
YOU1000000038_S0000114	yeah absolutely by the way congratulations to coach wheatley she actually just got married a couple weeks ago
YOU1000000038_S0000116	and the volleyball season well that is here as well several teams were taking part in their 1st scrimmages of the year on thursday snow hill welcome north dorchester to the town the snow hill eagles will have some high expectations coming in this year
YOU1000000038_S0000117	and as for dorchester as well it is a success even having a team on the court i mean the eagles is not the 1st time they have had a program reopening up this year now over although both teams were pretty pleased with what they saw from their team
YOU1000000038_S0000118	really returned to work on the fundamentals basics again drawn improves from serving some net play and really try to put together an offense that is going to be a little bit more aggressive than we were last year
YOU1000000038_S0000119	we have got 15 girls out here we kind of tried to go with our most athletic girls and just kind of work with it from there but they are very excited coach jackson and i are very excited so it is always cool to have a new program give the kid similar experiences
YOU1000000038_S0000120	she is absolutely right then i was thinking about that out what a great experience for these guys i mean they are going into the season they are not going to have too much pressure i mean no one is really expecting them to make a run as far as wins
YOU1000000038_S0000121	but just the fact it will be a part of a brand new program to get out there on the court and have a great time with your friends and to learn a new sporting be competitive with it i mean this is something they will be able to say for the rest of lives that they were part of the very 1st team there
YOU1000000038_S0000122	and i really i mean i can not imagine what that feeling must be like
YOU1000000038_S0000123	but you should that sounds like guys it is like the beginning we started from the beginning around when i was a part of a water polo team at my high school that was only in its 2nd year thought about patience when you are in a startup program and the eagles will learn so much of that this season
YOU1000000038_S0000124	and spencer one of the things they have to also see is being able to build that roster and see who is actually going to be able to perform well on the court
YOU1000000038_S0000125	yes absolutely moving for that will be a great test of just what this team is going to have
YOU1000000038_S0000126	all right and so many games on the eastern shore and tell us which one we should go to like our facebook page 47 a b c sports and after you do that go follow us on our twitter account at 47 a b c sports

YOU1000000038_S0000128	yeah absolutely and we e going to take another quick commercial break but do not go anywhere we are going to talk a little fantasy football after the break what players can make or break this year is team will discuss
YOU1000000038_S0000129	this is monica wheatley for the woodbridge field hockey team and you are watching the delmarva sports insider
YOU1000000038_S0000131	welcome back what we are going to talk a little fantasy football now guys and there is always that one guy is flying under the radar that can totally change your team just tell who you got this year
YOU1000000038_S0000132	my sleeper pick is actually someone i went to high school with t y hilton the front of the colts a wide receiver and he was as impressive with andrew luck he was impressive as andrew luck is number one option last season after the injury to propane reggie wayne
YOU1000000038_S0000133	i mean just look at those stats from last season hilton had 1083 yards and 5 touchdowns he is speedy and sure wayne is coming back this season but i think hilton will put a big numbers this season
YOU1000000038_S0000134	and give me some major points that i need
YOU1000000038_S0000135	yeah well my slipper i did not go to high school with but i am going with e j manuel manuel missed 6 games last season with an hyper extended knee but he has got some serious weapons now c j spiller fred jack jackson
YOU1000000038_S0000136	they traded for up in a draft for sammy watkins he is a monster the add robert woods and speed the marquise goodwin early but got mike williams and i mean there is a lot of weapons there a lot of young weapons but the very talented he is undrafted in most leagues you know
YOU1000000038_S0000137	so i think you you can make a case to be a good sleeper pick i definitely do you can definitely late in the draft
YOU1000000038_S0000138	i think there is a big reason why he was undrafted most leagues i am sleeping on manuel forward
YOU1000000038_S0000139	but the guy i am going with the titans are always hard i think ladarius green is going to have a big year for these chargers in this year
YOU1000000038_S0000140	i mean he did not exactly have amazing numbers last year i get it he just 13 catches in 3 ds but he is starting to take more and more reps with the ones philip rivers loves his tight ends i think he can get a lot of balls thrown his way this year
YOU1000000038_S0000141	well you think so
YOU1000000038_S0000142	i think so
YOU1000000038_S0000143	i know
YOU1000000038_S0000144	well have you ever had someone let you down
YOU1000000038_S0000145	that is what you needed them let us talk about the bus the worst fantasy football thing that could ever happened as the bus
YOU1000000038_S0000146	who are you guys going with today
YOU1000000038_S0000147	drum roll i got gronk i know somebody out there also has rob gronkowski as their bus i know this guy has an a c l injury and he is no adrian peterson let us be real the unlucky number here is 14 and no that is not the number of touchdowns
YOU1000000038_S0000148	he scored that is the how many weeks of football he is missed due to injury i understand that he is one of the top tight ends in the league when he was extremely healthy remember extremely healthy scoring 42 touchdowns in 50 career regular season games
YOU1000000038_S0000149	he is also had 8 career surgeries i just do not see the spark in gronkowski how much can you really physically overcome the season the game was just getting even harder
YOU1000000038_S0000150	i do not know any time you got brady i feel like you are going to be all right
YOU1000000038_S0000152	all right sorry now sorry eagle fans but i am going with nick foles yeah i know what you are saying nick foles had amazing numbers last season which is exactly why i am staying away from teams now have film of them in a prepared for chip kelly is offense
YOU1000000038_S0000153	plus he lost the sean jackson he looked lost when i was up there at eagles camp guys but so did all the eagles quarterbacks but i am not saying do not draft the eagles especially sean mccoy
YOU1000000038_S0000154	but i do not think nick foles is going to put up half the numbers he put up last year
YOU1000000038_S0000155	you just made a lot of people angry here
YOU1000000038_S0000157	i definitely want to stay away from though is eric decker i mean this guy is definitely cause some people from winning their leagues is we are going to dread on i get it i mean he had some good numbers in denver but the fact is that offense is ridiculous there
YOU1000000038_S0000158	and a number that you need to know is that guy dropped 30% of his catchable balls i mean he is not got good and he does not have good breakaway speed and i just do not feel like anyone to go near him at all

YOU1000000040_S0000004	and eat what the locals eat this is our 3rd video of the series and we are hunting down the popular snack of lahmacun eating a kebab drenched in browned butter
YOU1000000040_S0000005	and visiting a historic sweet shop for turkey is famous turkish delight you do not want to miss this video get ready for some mouth watering food
YOU1000000040_S0000006	i am thomas
YOU1000000040_S0000007	and i am sheena and we are taking a plate
YOU1000000040_S0000008	we hope you are hungry and let us eat
YOU1000000040_S0000010	we are starting our food hunting day over on the asian side of istanbul and the 1st thing we are going to eat is a thing called lahmacun so lahmacun you will often see described as turkish pizza but it is nothing alike it
YOU1000000040_S0000011	it has its really own unique identity and it is super delicious
YOU1000000040_S0000013	so this is lahmacun now i reckon it is called turkish pizza because it is round it is made up of dough and the dough has got some topping on it but it is really different in my opinion
YOU1000000040_S0000014	it take a small a clump of dough and they roll that dough out until it is really thin paper thin and then they smear it with a thin minced mixture of lamb parsley i think it is a little bit of chili on there
YOU1000000040_S0000015	and then they pop it into a really blazing hot wood fired oven now you can see that the dough is just perfectly blistered and in it has got that whole minced meat mixture on the top
YOU1000000040_S0000016	but it is so thin that you can see like parts of the dough coming through so the way that it is served is it comes with fresh parsley and some lemon so what you do is you grab some parsley pop it in the middle
YOU1000000040_S0000018	and then give a little bit of squeeze of lemon over the top of it and you take the whole thing and you roll it up so you would not think that the dough is very pliable but it is
YOU1000000040_S0000019	it is like beautifully soft alright let us give this thing a taste
YOU1000000040_S0000021	that is so good it is beautiful the dough is so soft but it has the perfect amount of crispiness it is almost a little bit floury but in a pleasant way
YOU1000000040_S0000022	and the minced meat mixture the lamb it has got so much flavor and there is just enough on there there is the perfect balance of meat and dough
YOU1000000040_S0000023	this is good my initial bite did not get any of that parsley in there so let us go for another one
YOU1000000040_S0000025	that fresh parsley imparts such a beautiful vibrant flavor and in that tiny squeeze and hint of lemon juice adds an acidity to that bite 0 man this is so good
YOU1000000040_S0000027	that was a great start to this food hunting day do not let anyone tell you that dish is like a pizza it is nothing like a pizza stands out on its own for its own reasons and it is incredible we are on to find some more food now
YOU1000000040_S0000029	our next stop is taking us down near the coast and how beautiful is this city so i am going to show you some shots of this beautiful coastline before we start eating again
YOU1000000040_S0000031	i am really excited about our next stop we are going to be eating a thing called an iskender kebab now kebab is like a common term for meat that is fashioned onto a skewer and then grilled and this kebab is made up of a plate of meat
YOU1000000040_S0000032	with tomato sauce creamy yogurt and brown butter it looks insane and the restaurant which is just over there
YOU1000000040_S0000033	is owned and operated by the family of the man who created this kebab way back in 1867 so there is a real history
YOU1000000040_S0000034	with this restaurant let us go and eat
YOU1000000040_S0000036	our kebab has just been delivered and this is unreal and it is pretty different to what you expect when you get some form of kebab here in turkey so normally there is bread around the outside but in this case there is a little bit of bread hiding underneath
YOU1000000040_S0000037	but it is all about the meat so all of this lamb is just piled on top and then to go with it a ginormous dollop of yogurt
YOU1000000040_S0000038	some grilled chili peppers and then some fresh tomato and on top of that meat is browned butter so that is going to just make it super rich and creamy so they bring over the big pan of brown butter
YOU1000000040_S0000039	and pour it all over the meat and you can actually see the tomato sauce that sheena mentioned as well so you can see the slight orange color in there and then look at the butter just glistening on that meat so
YOU1000000040_S0000040	let us just grab some meat get some bread from under there as well a whole lot of yogurt and get right on in
YOU1000000040_S0000042	0 wow
YOU1000000040_S0000044	wow that is good
YOU1000000040_S0000045	wow the meat is so soft it is not been charred right down so it does not have like the crunchy bits you often get with this type of meat it is just really soft
YOU1000000040_S0000046	it is quite salty it has got a beautiful saltiness
YOU1000000040_S0000048	that butter it just sort of coats your mouth i was expecting maybe it to be a little bit buttery a little bit oily on the top of my mouth
YOU1000000040_S0000049	not at all it is super rich and juicy i am going to get some more but this time i just want a couple of bits of meat so i do not want the yogurt or the bread the yogurt flavor was very strong so the sourness of the yogurt
YOU1000000040_S0000050	i think overtook from the meat flavor a bit
YOU1000000040_S0000052	0 yeah 0 that is good
YOU1000000040_S0000054	0 the butter flavor really really came home that time so it has got quite a sweetness which i guess is coming from that tomato sauce 0 this is really good
YOU1000000040_S0000055	i am going to make up a mouthful here with the flatbread the lamb and also some chili pepper and the bread has gone quite soft because of that tomato sauce and the butter and then that yogurt in there
YOU1000000040_S0000057	that is really good it is very rich from that butter creamy from that yogurt but then you can really taste the flavor of the meat that is delicious i am also washing it down with
YOU1000000040_S0000058	a drink called sawa and it is a slightly fermented grape juice sweetened grape juice and this is sort of the traditional accompaniment
YOU1000000040_S0000060	cold sweet refreshing a tiny little bit bubbly it is the perfect thing to go with this
YOU1000000040_S0000062	look how all that butter is just sitting in the bottom of the plate now so i am going to grab some more meat and that really soggy bread get it right through that butter super oily
YOU1000000040_S0000064	now i can really taste the butter in my 1st bites i could taste the butter but it was not a a big flavor that is a super bold flavor
YOU1000000040_S0000065	really rich and creamy and it is super oily so there is oils from the meat the tomato sauce and from the butter so you are getting this combination of different oiliness down there
YOU1000000040_S0000066	and it works a treat just hoeing into this plate is really really good
YOU1000000040_S0000068	now a day in istanbul is complete without a ferry ride or 2 so now we are catching the ferry from the asian side back over to europe we are going to continue our food hunt
YOU1000000040_S0000070	we have made it back to the european side of istanbul and next up we are going to have an absolute classic snack here in turkey and that is turkish delight now you will see this stuff piled up all over the city in the windows of shops
YOU1000000040_S0000071	massive piles of colorful turkish delight but we are not going to one of those places we are going to go to this really traditional place here that has been around since 1926 you will not see those vivid colors here from food coloring
YOU1000000040_S0000072	it is all natural and this stuff is really really good let us go grab some
YOU1000000040_S0000074	we are loaded up with our bags of turkish delight i wanted to stay in that sweet shop forever it had such a beautiful old world feel about it and the staff were so friendly they had these gorgeous huge candy jars
YOU1000000040_S0000075	filled with sweets tons of turkish delight and they even had big pots of homemade jam so you can take your own jam jars from
YOU1000000040_S0000077	fill it up 0 it was a beautiful spot we are now going to head off and find ourselves a turkish coffee to wash these babies down
YOU1000000040_S0000079	it is a holiday here in istanbul today so the coffee place we wanted to go to is sadly shut it is known as one of the best places to get a turkish coffee here in istanbul so that is why we wanted to go to that particular place
YOU1000000040_S0000080	so we have scrapped the coffee idea we are going to do the next best thing here in turkey and that is tea they have these brilliant little street side cafes just little mini cafes right on the footpath we are going to grab a tea there
YOU1000000040_S0000082	we have sat ourselves down at a small table at this tea cafe ordered up a couple of glasses of turkish tea and we are going to crack into this turkish delight
YOU1000000040_S0000083	so turkish delight in turkish is lokum and if you have never had lokum before it is like a jelly like sweet almost like a gummy and it is made out of corn flour and water and sugar
YOU1000000040_S0000084	and then they dust it with icing sugar once it is cooled and we ordered rose pistachio and mint flavor and we have had this before and we know that it is amazing so i have got the pistachio here
YOU1000000040_S0000086	it is beautiful the flavor of the pistachios is really strong so a really earthy flavor and the pistachios still have a bit of crunch they are not
YOU1000000040_S0000088	soft they are quite crunchy and then the texture of the turkish delight or the lokum is really sort of a little bit sticky tiny bit chewy but very soft and it is very sweet
YOU1000000040_S0000089	so this tea is going to go perfectly with it so they like to serve their tea with sugar the turks so i am going to pop the 2 sugars in because i find that the tea can be quite strong
YOU1000000040_S0000090	and quite bitter so we will just give that a bit of a stir
YOU1000000040_S0000092	all right let us have a sip of this chai or tea
YOU1000000040_S0000094	0 yeah that is really good so it is very strong quite bitter and i do not know if thomas mentioned but drinking tea is like a national pastime in turkey people stop and have a cup of tea like all throughout the day right from the early morning right through
YOU1000000040_S0000095	to the evening late late at night and both of us have really gotten into this pastime it is really nice to just take a moment out of your day sit watch the world go by sip your tea
YOU1000000040_S0000096	and this is a perfect combination you have got the really sweet turkish delight and then the bitter tea to wash it down
YOU1000000040_S0000098	all right i am going to grab a piece of mint turkish delight and this is my favorite flavor for turkish delight by a long way i have got great memories of turkish delight as a young boy eating it because it was a bit of a treat in my family both my parents
YOU1000000040_S0000099	and my auntie and uncle came to istanbul in the 70s they got a taste for turkish delight back then so it was always the treat thing we had on our out family is dinner table for after a meal let us try this mint
YOU1000000040_S0000101	0 that is delicious 0 the flavor just builds you know when it is natural mint flavor because it comes on slowly and like sheena said we have had this turkish delight before and i know that this mint flavor just
YOU1000000040_S0000102	evolves and evolves and even 10 minutes later it is still in your mouth incredibly strong that is a beautiful beautiful flavor and i love that it is not bright green like i talked about before
YOU1000000040_S0000103	when you see turkish delight in the shops on the main road the tourist strips bright greens bright pinks for the rose one these are not like that at all they are just very subtly colored little flecks of mint in the mint one
YOU1000000040_S0000104	and the taste is absolutely incredible so if you are here in istanbul you have definitely got to have a taste of turkish delight and make sure you get it from this place or one of the few places like this one but this place does an incredible version of turkish delight
YOU1000000040_S0000105	they are really good
YOU1000000040_S0000107	another great day of eating here in istanbul and we are finishing with one of the turkish delight places behind us that i have talked about a couple of times so the colorful stuff piled up on

YOU1000000044_S0000025	i had it most my life i actually a goatee i recently just shaved i had a full winter beard you as a full canadian understand that for the winter months
YOU1000000044_S0000026	but i always had some sort of facial hair except for 2 years most 2 or 3 years i guess when i worked in saskatchewan hauling crude oil
YOU1000000044_S0000027	because of the fire restrictions to be able to wear a mask in case of emergency you are not allowed to have any facial hair except for a mustache so
YOU1000000044_S0000028	yes i am forgetting thanks for reminding me about the about the camera because i am used to having it on my computer and now it is between the both of us
YOU1000000044_S0000029	so i always had a clean shaven face during that time and that was probably one of the more depressing parts of my life i like my job but it just never felt like me
YOU1000000044_S0000030	so that is it was one of the 1st things i did as soon as i stopped working at that we moved back to montreal was to grow my facial hair again i do not think i have ever gone without it since
YOU1000000044_S0000031	yeah i i have maybe once or twice so i i think
YOU1000000044_S0000032	after a botched shave job just shave start over again but it was very temporarily
YOU1000000044_S0000033	yeah i think so funny tibit actually before we went to saskatchewan you had long hair
YOU1000000044_S0000034	very long hair
YOU1000000044_S0000035	long hair and before before that he had very long hair like you can not even see how long it was
YOU1000000044_S0000036	that was a different time and place
YOU1000000044_S0000037	so yeah he has gone through different phases but i love beard i know i i
YOU1000000044_S0000038	i do not know just something about it i i just like it i mean i like it when you shave it off too but it is just some that forest cave man anything or not

YOU1000000044_S0000148	and the train climbs up to about 3 quarters to the the top and from there you switch over to another train cogwheel of course
YOU1000000044_S0000149	which takes you right to the very top the last part going through is a tunnel through one of the peaks and when you arrive at the top you are at a lookout point that is 11371 feet
YOU1000000044_S0000151	it is amazing i was in switzerland and was tired from my trip and almost did not go and thank you to my lovely wife who convince me that i was crazy to be there and not go through with it

YOU1000000044_S0000297	13th to 15th wow so you definitely been around for a while
YOU1000000044_S0000299	bottle caps if you watch my last video i made and there is no editing cuts in it
YOU1000000044_S0000300	which is better than to hold somebody is attention lots of fast editing
YOU1000000044_S0000301	or something cuts which is better to hold somebody is attention
YOU1000000044_S0000302	lots of fast or something just smooth
YOU1000000044_S0000303	okay the question into it it really depends on the messages you want to tell
YOU1000000044_S0000304	i mean yeah i do i have some very fast editing but i also if you take my 16 again for a day videos a lot of them are where i grew up in the gas bay
YOU1000000044_S0000305	
YOU1000000044_S0000307	they are are not very fast and and they should not cause will absolutely destroy the mood you do a lot of outdoor scenery
YOU1000000044_S0000308	and it also depends on your music too what you want to do my last one i did with the european countries i mean they are they are very slow panning
YOU1000000044_S0000309	but you notice once it get to croatia it goes chee chee chee and turns the side will that is a white flash i put it and then i rotate i forget maybe 25 degrees
YOU1000000044_S0000310	but that is just for a transformation to follow with the beat yeah smooth is great lots of people that that is it depends what you want what kind of story you want to tell
YOU1000000044_S0000311	it is amazing how you can take one piece of footage grab 10 different tracks of different genres different tempos
YOU1000000044_S0000312	and completely tell a story that would have made would have you would have never even guessed of making just by following the beat
YOU1000000044_S0000313	and also too it depends on the editor what they are comfortable with i mean i some people it is like guitar players when i was in bands
YOU1000000044_S0000314	there are some guys whether the song was 10 beats a minute i know that is extreme i am just for the point of conversation
YOU1000000044_S0000315	or 200 beats a minute they play the same wiry fast screaming solo over to it
YOU1000000044_S0000316	and for me it just did not make any sense but to them that is just what they wanted to do so
YOU1000000044_S0000318	but i find for what you do your type of videos and the type of music you go with smoother is definitely speaks more what you do and they were great
YOU1000000044_S0000320	dun says that he has facebook dun if you can just go over to our facebook pusha studios will that work or

YOU1000000044_S0000401	put your own and then put somebody else is
YOU1000000044_S0000402	the best practice i think was 2 videos yeah
YOU1000000044_S0000403	2 videos in this thing are going to be good or for catching attention and letting people know what you are about
YOU1000000044_S0000404	put it on its like advertising its free advertising you do not want to be shy advertising you want to be advertising
YOU1000000044_S0000405	we are a coop and we are got to each represent ourselves but also we are hoping each other the same time so it is a win win for everybody
YOU1000000044_S0000406	so yeah that is what they were doing they are putting up one or 2 their own especially if you are just starting there
YOU1000000044_S0000407	and then watch a bunch of peoples and you see somebody that is not on there yet definitely i want couple of theirs like one or 2 from as many people as possible

YOU1000000044_S0000483	we showed this last night just to show you where xenya is from originally
YOU1000000044_S0000484	excuse me so this is the map of europe of course and there is latvia and that is the capital riga where she was raised and
YOU1000000044_S0000485	and pusha the town that we named our business after
YOU1000000044_S0000486	now we laughed last night cause i did not get it it is tricky to find it is a small little town there is pusha
YOU1000000044_S0000487	and this is this is the town that we named our business after because that is where her mom grew up
YOU1000000044_S0000488	roughly 45 kilometers from the russian border beautiful place i absolutely adore it there
YOU1000000044_S0000489	let us see if i can find
YOU1000000044_S0000491	kinda tricky to show pictures i got it last night for the road but its very white on my screen cause of the light so i might not be able to see it
YOU1000000044_S0000492	but we will give it a try anyways look here we will just do one on the road here
YOU1000000044_S0000494	now i got that in my way so i am have to bring this up a little bit bear with me
YOU1000000044_S0000496	close this and 0 my youtube advertisements are getting in the way and that is okay
YOU1000000044_S0000497	just
YOU1000000044_S0000499	that is a bit of the scenery and its gorgeous over there we do still have some property over there
YOU1000000044_S0000500	in just up this road we can go for a little walk drive youtube google drive you want to call it that
YOU1000000044_S0000501	as you can see it reminds me a lot of some of the people here that are from canada may be familiar it reminds me a bit of new brunswick except it is mostly pine trees instead of spruce
YOU1000000044_S0000503	but a lot of the same kind of rolling rolling hills had not very unmountainous
YOU1000000044_S0000504	that there is only one mountain and that is literally 300 meters high
YOU1000000044_S0000506	but till an amazing amazingly beautiful place i think i found it
YOU1000000044_S0000508	go in
YOU1000000044_S0000510	over here
YOU1000000044_S0000512	and this is the her mom is family home and right over here this is the new house they are building in front actually but it was right at the spot
YOU1000000044_S0000514	so yeah no it is a beautiful place not a lot of travelers i kinda stand out when i am there
YOU1000000044_S0000515	latvians and a very very hard language to speak there is only 1700000 people around the world i believe or 2000000 that speak it
YOU1000000044_S0000516	yeah
YOU1000000044_S0000517	it is considered an endangered language i was learning russian because of course as an ex soviet country you can get by with russian in most places
YOU1000000044_S0000518	there is from the side and here is where the stork is that i always like to see when we go to the stork is nest
YOU1000000044_S0000519	so which is cool because almost every house does have a nest and the thing is like the size of a 45 gallon drum
YOU1000000044_S0000520	the we actually stay in the new house when we were visiting the last time and a stork landed on the roof and they are all excited so that is a sign of good luck
YOU1000000044_S0000521	cause it means that whoever in the house was probably going to have a child we already have 3 so i informed my wife there was no way i was staying in the house that night
YOU1000000044_S0000522	so
YOU1000000044_S0000523	0 honestly say it is enough
YOU1000000044_S0000524	yeah yeah we have we have done our part so
YOU1000000044_S0000525	jaded diva says that he uses googler all the time they love it
YOU1000000044_S0000526	0 there is a game i always play well i played for a week and then i i get too obsessed with it and have to back off for a bit
YOU1000000044_S0000527	and it is called geo geoguessr
YOU1000000044_S0000529	and its google maps but you can pick like either the european union or the united states canada there is tons of maps are already made
YOU1000000044_S0000530	and it drops you off in the middle of nowhere and you have to guess where you are
YOU1000000044_S0000531	and you can walk as i was just doing a minute to go through it but you cannot zoom out enough to see which country you are into you could always see where you are at
YOU1000000044_S0000532	that is really cool like i love doing the europe one cause you got to guess by the language on the signs trucks passing
YOU1000000044_S0000533	and then you you the points are determined you start off with 5000
YOU1000000044_S0000534	and they start deducting for a point i believe or 2 for every kilometer that you are away from the exact point
YOU1000000044_S0000535	and it is not like you can just pick the country you got a pick the area where you are into for anybody who loves google maps it it really makes it a lot funner
YOU1000000044_S0000536	something to look into and this is where i am from well
YOU1000000044_S0000537	here is montreal here and i am from what they call the gas bay and this is like that thumb that sticks out from quebec overtop in new brunswick and of course maine in the lower side

YOU1000000044_S0000561	yeah that is true maoerman is from edmondston
YOU1000000044_S0000562	0 edmundston when we travel home we always go by new brunswick that is why i was curious we always go by edmundston
YOU1000000044_S0000563	along the 185 and then into which is it number 2 i believe it is if i am not mistaken so amazing to have you here that is great
YOU1000000044_S0000565	
YOU1000000044_S0000567	one of the big land on of the big attractions on the gas bay because it is all small towns it is all coastal fishing communities mostly
YOU1000000044_S0000569	this is one of the most famous of the places and this usually represents the province of quebec a lot of times
YOU1000000044_S0000570	when they do different visuals from all the provinces and it is called perce rock
YOU1000000044_S0000571	and it is just a rock that literally was they figured moved about 80 kilometers during the ice age you can see in proportion to the buildings here
YOU1000000044_S0000573	and it is one of the most beautifully beautiful places and its heavily photo photographed
YOU1000000044_S0000574	ancient you feel like you have just traveled back in time every time you see it it it is incredible
YOU1000000044_S0000575	just looking and see there is any other really great pictures of it
YOU1000000044_S0000576	which there is a small ferry that the ferry tourist boats that drive right through the hole
YOU1000000044_S0000577	and the pieces beside her was once connected but overtime has fallen apart and eventually that is what will happen of course to the other one as well
YOU1000000044_S0000578	there is a huge bird sanctuary there you can just see the corner of it right here called bonaventure island
YOU1000000044_S0000579	and it is monitored by i believe it is mcgill university from montreal
YOU1000000044_S0000580	another perspective of it from the backside just to show you the size of it it is colossal
YOU1000000044_S0000582	but it is definitely a place that if you are ever looking for somewhere off the beaten path
YOU1000000044_S0000583	it is friendly it is all that you can do the coast about you can easily do it in a day but you will drive yourself crazy
YOU1000000044_S0000584	to really visit it you give yourself 3 or 4 days you know to see varied
YOU1000000044_S0000586	varied terrain it is almost like traveling through 3 different countries i would say almost i would
YOU1000000044_S0000587	yes
YOU1000000044_S0000588	you know cause they do not have any in common the north side has some of the oldest rocks in the world black worn down
YOU1000000044_S0000589	but an amazing feeling as the saint lawrence seaway comes in on the lower side here is a lot more closer to red rock that you would find for instance price edward island
YOU1000000044_S0000590	but not as red as theirs so that is oxidized
YOU1000000044_S0000591	and then where i have lived for instance as we come to the park following that river which is nothing but trees and some of the highest mountains in quebec
YOU1000000044_S0000592	which course of are all part of the appalachians that run all the way down to the south of the united states
YOU1000000044_S0000593	we are all connected yeah so there is just some of the photos from it there is some from the island of the bird sanctuary

YOU1000000044_S0000643	whose is this studio livestream sorry if i said the name wrong now the town is what i know you guys were talking about it but
YOU1000000044_S0000644	exactly what country is it in i am sure i am guessing a europe correct
YOU1000000044_S0000645	yes that is correct it is in latvia
YOU1000000044_S0000646	
YOU1000000044_S0000647	yeah and latvia is a coastal country for the baltic sea right across from sweden
YOU1000000044_S0000648	
YOU1000000044_S0000649	yeah well roughly across from sweden i guess bit an angle but yeah you go through poland and then to lithuania and then to latvia
YOU1000000044_S0000650	cause lithuania latvia and estonia is referred to as the baltic states
YOU1000000044_S0000651	i have heard of all that yes
YOU1000000044_S0000652	so yeah
YOU1000000044_S0000653	i must say for a person has been through europe what did did you say was 12 countries in 15 days or was it 15 countries in 12 days
YOU1000000044_S0000654	so 12 in 15 yeah
YOU1000000044_S0000655	that is amazing and i have keep it in mind i have never been to europe
YOU1000000044_S0000656	but my grandmother she has been to london she has been to france she has been to italy she went to florence where the renaissance began
YOU1000000044_S0000657	wow

YOU1000000044_S0000660	okay that is good though got you getting out doing stuff like that maybe some time for a trip to europe for you both
YOU1000000044_S0000661	well i am we are waiting for no offense the madness that was going on recently over there to calm down
YOU1000000044_S0000662	definitely no that makes sense we have not been over in what is it 2 years almost 3 years
YOU1000000044_S0000663	yeah this summer it is going to be 3 years we have not been there but
YOU1000000044_S0000664	it is a longtime feels like because we were traveling there every year almost and then and then kinda paused for a bit but
YOU1000000044_S0000665	which country would you like to visit there
YOU1000000044_S0000666	well frankly i would love to visit either italy
YOU1000000044_S0000667	or greece because both have a rich history
YOU1000000044_S0000668	yes
YOU1000000044_S0000669	i would like to go to florence because i mean in my history class that was of course where the renaissance began
YOU1000000044_S0000670	right
YOU1000000044_S0000672	also i must say i love the photos you have behind you from europe i would like that i am into historic architecture that is something i like

YOU1000000044_S0000679	0 man that is that is beautiful i love that remind me it kind of reminded me of venice almost
YOU1000000044_S0000680	i know that is probably not not actually venice but it looks similar when you think about it
YOU1000000044_S0000682	there so other people can see too
YOU1000000044_S0000683	0 okay
YOU1000000044_S0000684	i can see it clearly

YOU1000000044_S0000691	and 0 some of us some together and some of my own
YOU1000000044_S0000692	but the ones behind me there is the 12 them that was my 1st ever time i traveled for 2 weeks mostly by train across europe
YOU1000000044_S0000693	wow
YOU1000000044_S0000695	what is that
YOU1000000044_S0000696	i have never traveled the country by train i have been on plenty of the scenic railroads and what not but i have never been on a legit cross country passenger train run
YOU1000000044_S0000697	i have always wanted to do that i know canada has some very beautiful scenery and they still use vintage passenger equipment i think from the 50s and 60s
YOU1000000044_S0000698	some of them yeah they they have been a modern modern modernizing thank you
YOU1000000044_S0000699	but yeah they do still have some in the engine still running in there and there is also the more where expensive one maybe bottle caps can help you with the name of it
YOU1000000044_S0000700	i think it is the canadian i know that one of their trains that still uses the vintage passenger car fleet
YOU1000000044_S0000701	yeah that but that is still part of the via rail one but there is another privatized one that runs from calgary to vancouver
YOU1000000044_S0000702	0 wow
YOU1000000044_S0000703	and it stops at all the fairmont hotels all the 5 star hotels every night and
YOU1000000044_S0000704	i know the canadian actually
YOU1000000044_S0000705	i know they stopped i think a few at few of the chateaus that were built by the canadian pacific i could be wrong i could be wrong
YOU1000000044_S0000706	
YOU1000000044_S0000708	but yeah i did like i said in the stream chat i have been wanting to try do an interview about my channel for a while now
YOU1000000044_S0000709	i actually tried to do to self interviews they were i really do not think they were very good in my opinion
YOU1000000044_S0000710	this is an honor for me okay keep that in mind
YOU1000000044_S0000711	0 my god it is an honor for us to have you here

YOU1000000044_S0000719	alright
YOU1000000044_S0000720	it is a great place that is where a lot of us that are here met each other i am looking to the list here and that is a lot of them came from there and it is a great place to network with other people
YOU1000000044_S0000721	0 also here i i am going to send you guys the link to my stream because
YOU1000000044_S0000722	i included your channel in the description for the stream right now it is still live for me
YOU1000000044_S0000723	okay
YOU1000000044_S0000724	and it is at very bottom of the list my apologies sometimes i include channels here or there that even though it is out in the stream i figured it is too good not to include
YOU1000000044_S0000725	right
YOU1000000044_S0000726	when i saw your winds your video where you film the wind turbines train i still think it is very well done
YOU1000000044_S0000727	thank you
YOU1000000044_S0000728	that that is really got me interested in your channel and i must say your work is truly phenomenal and some of the most incredible video work i have seen
YOU1000000044_S0000729	0 thank you i appreciate that you are you are too kind
YOU1000000044_S0000730	yeah it is that train was filmed in the gas bay where i grew up where i showed on the map a while ago
YOU1000000044_S0000731	and we are home on vacation and how the train thing started is i have always loved trains but i i wanted something to do with my my middle age
YOU1000000044_S0000732	cause i have 3 children we have 3 children excuse me and my middle one is now 11 he was 10 at the time and i just wanted something i could do with him
YOU1000000044_S0000733	and i wanted to keep shooting stuff it is hard with video because hard to find things that are interesting sometimes
YOU1000000044_S0000734	and that is when i finally decided to try the trains with him so he would come out with me all the time and
YOU1000000044_S0000735	he was a good supporter we all get into it he gets you know he gets to know it is a good way to spend time together
YOU1000000044_S0000736	so long story short we are in the gas bay and the nicely thing about that train is that up until a couple years ago it was not an active railway via rail was not going through there
YOU1000000044_S0000737	prior to that was the c n they already privatized the freight but then there was a problem with one of the trestles and therefore they shut down all passenger
YOU1000000044_S0000738	so now you have to go to town of new brunswick campbellton campbellton in the province new brunswick just to be able to get a passenger train which is an hour away from where i live
YOU1000000044_S0000739	ouch
YOU1000000044_S0000740	but since they start to build these windmills they actually have to truck them from the coast about 200 kilometers to that point then they load them on these train carts
YOU1000000044_S0000741	and from there yeah so the maximum they are allowed is 72 cars because well for canada you are allowed maximum 2 kilometer rail
YOU1000000044_S0000742	because that is the longest spur that they have that has to go off the tracks
YOU1000000044_S0000743	and they publicize it you can go on their website and it will show you exactly when the train is leaving the full schedules
YOU1000000044_S0000744	i actually never caught a turbine train before i have never caught one
YOU1000000044_S0000745	yeah
YOU1000000044_S0000746	i did not even see though a railroad here in the u s norfolk southern has a program
YOU1000000044_S0000747	where they paint some of their locomotives into the railroad paint schemes of rail road that they either merged or just simply no longer exist
YOU1000000044_S0000748	right
YOU1000000044_S0000749	for one instance when i was an outturna pennsylvania i actually caught the 1st as what we railroad friends here call heritage units
YOU1000000044_S0000750	yes
YOU1000000044_S0000751	and it was the pennsylvania heritage unit
YOU1000000044_S0000752	i kinda find that a perfect one to catch because the track you going throughout was formerly was owned and ran by the pennsylvania railroad
YOU1000000044_S0000753	wow that is interesting
YOU1000000044_S0000755	that is very cool yeah you do a lot about digging behind the scene that is what i like about what you do actually
YOU1000000044_S0000756	thank you i will tell you i am into trains i have been into them since i was 2 years old but that is not the only thing that i do on my channel
YOU1000000044_S0000757	that is this live streaming i only got into recently i actually was only started in on my birthday that is really when i 1st got started with this
YOU1000000044_S0000758	it is truly been getting more of the attention on that channel ever since
YOU1000000044_S0000760	i really do not know
YOU1000000044_S0000762	it is a great way of getting the view time
YOU1000000044_S0000763	definitely there is nothing wrong with that i mean we all here to grow and and it is nice to new ways it is like
YOU1000000044_S0000764	as if a painter started painting and then only did the same type of style the rest of their life
YOU1000000044_S0000765	that is true
YOU1000000044_S0000766	i actually collaborated with another youtuber before recently his name is jesse juillet
YOU1000000044_S0000767	he does he is a good gaming youtuber he he does videos on a game called roblox
YOU1000000044_S0000768	yes
YOU1000000044_S0000769	i do not know if you have heard of it but he and i have done almost 34 videos together now
YOU1000000044_S0000770	wow good

YOU1000000044_S0000780	0 that is okay as long as you have other hobbies like you have this and stuff so
YOU1000000044_S0000781	true that is true

YOU1000000044_S0000790	0 that is great cause it means you got another reason to go back
YOU1000000044_S0000791	true but it was my grandmother who was able to make the trip possible i had waited 13 years to go to alaska 13 years
YOU1000000044_S0000792	2003 to 2016 and it was mainly due to a film my grandmother brought back on her trip to alaska back in 2003
YOU1000000044_S0000793	it was about a railroad that is the in skagway alaska it is called the white pass and yukon route
YOU1000000044_S0000794	okay
YOU1000000044_S0000795	and it has been in use since 1898 and it did not shut down normal revenue service until 1982
YOU1000000044_S0000796	okay and it only stayed closed for 5 years and a reopened into the current operation it does now which is excursion trains in 1988
YOU1000000044_S0000797	and i after she brought the documentary back in 2003 i
YOU1000000044_S0000798	let us just say in her own words once i sat down and watched it i never moved i was enthralled by it
YOU1000000044_S0000799	and she told me the next time she went back she would take me with her and i waited of course like i said 13 years
YOU1000000044_S0000800	then i finally got to see the railroad for myself and ride it in 2016 and i have plenty of footage of it now
YOU1000000044_S0000802	a lot of my film i am still trying to improve on none of the videos are currently edited i will admit that there is there is a lot of stuff i am still trying to work on with my channel
YOU1000000044_S0000803	
YOU1000000044_S0000805	but i mean i would kind of like it that my videos are not edited
YOU1000000044_S0000806	because a lot of the time not many youtubers really upload unedited footage anymore and i like to show what normal youtuber is really just decide to leave out that is what i like to do
YOU1000000044_S0000807	right well everybody has got a find their own way to express themselves on youtube i agree
YOU1000000044_S0000808	talked with bottle caps tonight about that that is exactly what it is everybody is going to find there own way that they feel comfortable and sending their message
YOU1000000044_S0000809	that is true
YOU1000000044_S0000810	look at musicians we can take the same song same lyrics and given to 20 different musicians they all going to come up with a different way of expressing it
YOU1000000044_S0000812	same with the music i mean i have always some times i have always said that i feel like i was just born in the wrong time because when you think about it
YOU1000000044_S0000813	if you see my videos i mean especially one i did kettle creek battlefield
YOU1000000044_S0000814	it s a revolutionary war battlefield 7 miles from washington georgia where i live i live in athens but you know the battlefield is 7 miles from washington but
YOU1000000044_S0000815	in the video i make a point to mention that i have a deep respect for war veterans a very deep respect for them
YOU1000000044_S0000816	
YOU1000000044_S0000817	cause i mean just think about it just what they have gone through alone you know you know they need that only i do not like it when they are forgotten
YOU1000000044_S0000818	yeah
YOU1000000044_S0000819	and that they deserve to be remembered especially for what all they did
YOU1000000044_S0000821	and i have a very deep respect for people who have come before my time
YOU1000000044_S0000822	for a lot of the historic you know events that have happened before my time all of that
YOU1000000044_S0000823	but what interested me most as you know a lot of things were around before my time you know a lot of antiques and what not i find that very interesting
YOU1000000044_S0000824	how many people in my generation really care about that stuff
YOU1000000044_S0000825	not many you are right you are very true
YOU1000000044_S0000826	that is true and it is a shame it is so its great to have somebody like you that might inspire some them to go and take a 2nd look at it so

YOU1000000044_S0000870	whenever i do these steams i can never stay and talk about one specific topic
YOU1000000044_S0000871	i mean it just it is sort of random when you think about it really
YOU1000000044_S0000872	that is that is keeps wheel turning

YOU1000000044_S0000874	nice
YOU1000000044_S0000876	stream sub stream that is what i call that
YOU1000000044_S0000877	yeah that is a good term
YOU1000000044_S0000878	that is right contagious in a good way we are growing
YOU1000000044_S0000879	i tell you my parents have actually told me i ma pretty one whose unforgettable and i think they are right
YOU1000000044_S0000880	i recently went to a rail line in west virginia it is called the cass scenic railroad which is really worth checking out by the way
YOU1000000044_S0000881	and i actually befriended one of the guys who works on the train his name is josh and when i met him for the 1st time he was actually a commentator slash brakeman
YOU1000000044_S0000882	and i did afterwards i ended up leaving cass to go back to georgia once our trip there ended and
YOU1000000044_S0000883	i did not go back for 2 years and when i recently made a return trip which is heavily documented on my channel
YOU1000000044_S0000884	i now was also on the same trip where went to niagara falls okay in ontario canada
YOU1000000044_S0000886	i you know saw him i said hey man you remember me and it was like
YOU1000000044_S0000887	he remembered me after 2 years of not seeing me he remembered who i was as
YOU1000000044_S0000888	that is amazing
YOU1000000044_S0000889	that it was the same with my mom my dad is mother too when she went i think it was either hong kong or beijing she went there like 3 times
YOU1000000044_S0000890	there was a street vendor who remembered her and she has not even been been back i think 3 years at one point
YOU1000000044_S0000892	wow yeah well some people are just more memorable sounds like you
YOU1000000044_S0000893	i think it depend on their character
YOU1000000044_S0000894	you stand out so that is you want to do in life that is what you need for youtube so that is all good traits so
YOU1000000044_S0000895	i mean there is few reasons i made the channel one the 1st reason originally was i want i made it
YOU1000000044_S0000897	you know in 2015 but this was when i had just started getting into filming and at this point i had a computer
YOU1000000044_S0000898	that you know really did not work too well and it always had a hard drive crash every 5 or 10 sec minutes in a sense
YOU1000000044_S0000899	and i lost everything on at the a really sporadic basis and it was annoying okay it was very annoying
YOU1000000044_S0000900	and the computer i have now which is a toshiba laptop i had for almost i think 2 or 3 years now
YOU1000000044_S0000901	it is proven to be a very good computer it is only had one hard drive crash and its not had crash since knock on wood
YOU1000000044_S0000902	good yeah knock on wood for sure
YOU1000000044_S0000903	but yet when i was uploading my videos or at least try to save them on my computer i was i mean i had already been to youtube i have been into youtube for a while now
YOU1000000044_S0000904	but yeah hold on a 2nd train man i included your channel in the description by the way
YOU1000000044_S0000905	yeah i made the channel so i would have a place to put my videos in case my computer crashed again i would not lose them
YOU1000000044_S0000906	i never really thought any body would view them or watch them i did not even know if i am get any subscribers
YOU1000000044_S0000907	and keep the mind the footage is still there but it is nearly 4 years old and in my opinion now it is like really bad okay
YOU1000000044_S0000908	i have even labeled one of my playlist which is when i filmed in folkestone it is in parentheses
YOU1000000044_S0000909	well bad film if you will cause it is can not be watched okay i was really inexperienced when i filmed that let me tell you
YOU1000000044_S0000910	well that is we all learn we are start somewhere we look at back our own work but i mean it is all part of the process
YOU1000000044_S0000911	and a lot of times is making of a good thing out of something that did not quite work out the way we are hoping
YOU1000000044_S0000912	true
YOU1000000044_S0000913	i have a video if you have ever seen it it is called montreal slowmo and the reason why is i recorded by accident out of my car
YOU1000000044_S0000914	i did not realize i would switch to 220 frames a 2nd
YOU1000000044_S0000915	0 man
YOU1000000044_S0000916	so i recorded literally 2 hours of slowmo and i was like what i do
YOU1000000044_S0000917	0 no
YOU1000000044_S0000918	yeah so i am looking at all this stuff and i am like 0 it is ruined
YOU1000000044_S0000919	imagine if it was like a traffic jam
YOU1000000044_S0000920	yeah yeah yeah it was in actually and i covered a good 20 kilometers like what 9 miles 10 mikes something like that
YOU1000000044_S0000921	wow
YOU1000000044_S0000922	so i decided to come and pick it up and i took it and turned into a 1970 cop show intro which i always love those little shows so
YOU1000000044_S0000923	nice
YOU1000000044_S0000924	might as well do something with it so

YOU1000000044_S0000928	yes
YOU1000000044_S0000929	well the railroad part refers to my interest
YOU1000000044_S0000930	not just in trains but also in travel and vintage vehicles like planes and cars i have an interest in that
YOU1000000044_S0000931	excellent

YOU1000000044_S0000935	okay
YOU1000000044_S0000936	of all areas all spectrums and 2000 is really really refers to the year i was born i was born in 2000 so i was born at the start
YOU1000000044_S0000937	kind of figured that one i was not a 100% but i am putting money on that one
YOU1000000044_S0000938	i mean do not ask 0 are going to be ask everyone asked me about the 1st 2 parts of the name but the last part is sort of self explanatory when you think about it

YOU1000000044_S0000966	yes
YOU1000000044_S0000967	true
YOU1000000044_S0000968	and definitely good for for the algorithm as well so
YOU1000000044_S0000969	yeah
YOU1000000044_S0000971	i mean but the also going back to the reason i made my channel
YOU1000000044_S0000972	aside from the me making the channel as a web place to store my videos
YOU1000000044_S0000973	you know i did not as i said you know i did not think anyone would even watch the video
YOU1000000044_S0000974	i did not even you know i just already sort of make the assumption you know 0 no one probably will like them anyway but
YOU1000000044_S0000975	eventually you know people started to take notice it was slow at 1st but after a few months it hit my channel has gotten to like i think 22 subscribers
YOU1000000044_S0000976	then it started to drop and i was wondering okay you you know what was i doing wrong okay
YOU1000000044_S0000977	if you look at my playlist that i filmed in folkestone take note none of the videos are named
YOU1000000044_S0000978	i did not name i do not think i even named it until like a few weeks back
YOU1000000044_S0000979	and i mean i had footage from cass our drive from north carolina to cass west virginia
YOU1000000044_S0000980	and keep in mind when i was filming these videos i had a earlier camera it was a i think it was a sony camera
YOU1000000044_S0000981	it was not a camcorder in fact hang on a minute i have the newest camera used for my trip to alaska right here
YOU1000000044_S0000983	see here let me get it out here
YOU1000000044_S0000985	this is the this is it this is what i have been using since 2016 and it is proven to be a very good camera
YOU1000000044_S0000986	i got it specifically for the trip to alaska
YOU1000000044_S0000987	okay
YOU1000000044_S0000989	i am telling you that is one of the best cameras i have used i am telling you that is one of the best cameras i have used
YOU1000000044_S0000990	well that is the biggest thing is if you are comfortable with that is that is what make everything
YOU1000000044_S0000991	i am comfortable with it i can tell you that but the phone i am using a to livestream is actually one of the newer electronics i have gotten in a while
YOU1000000044_S0000992	the phone i used to have was one my dad had and it did not livestream
YOU1000000044_S0000993	even when i recorded with their normal camera when you zoom in on the camera it made everything pixelated 0 my god i hated it i was annoyed by that
YOU1000000044_S0000994	i could not zoom in on any little details i wanted to get
YOU1000000044_S0000996	so i used that phone with the camera zoom out most of the time or just barely zoom in but this one
YOU1000000044_S0000997	like for instance other than this here i mean if you watch the stream camera footage here let me just do this as an example
YOU1000000044_S0000998	so you see my phone here right you see it is aiming towards the computer see you yeah watch see
YOU1000000044_S0001000	zoom in there look at that it picks up even the computer screen pixel and then i can see the little details in the buildings in the photo behind you
YOU1000000044_S0001001	that is amazing what kind of phone is that
YOU1000000044_S0001002	it is an verizon l g g 5 i think it is what it is called
YOU1000000044_S0001003	0
YOU1000000044_S0001005	very good phone it is one of the newest phones i had gotten by god it works well only problem with my old phone i can record in sort of that 1st person camera view there

YOU1000000044_S0001007	now with this when i am only i am limited to only 5 minutes so i usually film and multi view
YOU1000000044_S0001008	that is how i got a lot of the video in my bahamas trip filmed they were in a multi view function where you saw my face on one side and then you saw what i wanted the viewer to see on the other
YOU1000000044_S0001009	a lot of the video are filmed in the bahamas with a steel drummer artist named cordeal he was good with playing music on the steel drums

YOU1000000044_S0001032	yeah the other reason is become one of which is sort of another this other reason has become more recent to me

YOU1000000044_S0001034	they came well after me by quite a few years and
YOU1000000044_S0001035	then i realized you know i do not know my grandmother would be able to would still be able to travel by the time my sister those 2 reached my age
YOU1000000044_S0001036	i do not even know and i do not mean any offense to her
YOU1000000044_S0001037	no no

YOU1000000044_S0001040	i do not know if she would still be alive when aubrey is my age
YOU1000000044_S0001041	yeah
YOU1000000044_S0001042	so the reason i want to make my channel now is so those 2 can see my videos and see the trips that she and i went on together
YOU1000000044_S0001043	0 wow
YOU1000000044_S0001044	keep in mind i have been traveling with her sine i 1st came on here since 2008
YOU1000000044_S0001045	a lot of those early trips have never been filmed
YOU1000000044_S0001046	that i ask recently you know if we had time when we had time available if we could try and revisit some of the places we 1st traveled to
YOU1000000044_S0001047	the 1st place i ever went to with her was to kennesaw georgia now that is near atlanta
YOU1000000044_S0001048	and its where 2 civil war steam locomotives are housed one is named the general the other is named the texas
YOU1000000044_S0001049	okay
YOU1000000044_S0001050	and if you do not know what the andrews raider is i recommend looking it up it is quite unique and is quite interesting as to how it all played out
YOU1000000044_S0001051	both locomotives are preserved and i was amazed by how the story about it
YOU1000000044_S0001052	
YOU1000000044_S0001053	and it took place during the american civil war
YOU1000000044_S0001054	where some union spies tried to take a confederate locomotive to burn railroad bridges along confederal rail lines
YOU1000000044_S0001055	try to stop confederate is supply movements but unfortunately their plan failed and they were eventually captured by the confederates
YOU1000000044_S0001056	all i think all of them received the medal of honor the ones who survived the p 0 w camp
YOU1000000044_S0001058	i think all of them got the medal of honor i think they were the 1st to received it except andrews he was excluded as a civilian unfortunately
YOU1000000044_S0001059	but the film has been the even has been you know sort of i guess you can say immortalized thanks to both locomotives being preserved
YOU1000000044_S0001060	the general was restored to operating condition in the 1960 during the civil war is centennial
YOU1000000044_S0001061	right
YOU1000000044_S0001062	and eventually found its way to georgia and its been on display in kennesaw ever since
YOU1000000044_S0001063	texas was on display at the atlanta cyclorama until recently when it went to spencer north carolina for cosmetic restoration from what i heard

YOU1000000044_S0001097	i am really glad and i mean i would like i like to spend as much time her as i can and believe me
YOU1000000044_S0001098	i mean i have a deep respect for like i said people come before my time she is one of them and she is a very kind lady
YOU1000000044_S0001099	she is very wise she is humorous she is actually hosting a party for some friends right out as i am speaking
YOU1000000044_S0001101	your host is distracted if you will
YOU1000000044_S0001102	okay 0 that is fun
YOU1000000044_S0001103	we are going we are actually going to be going on another trip in a few days we are going to be revisiting a few towns down of southwest georgia
YOU1000000044_S0001104	one of them is named a cordele georgia i have footage of my 1st trip there on my channel
YOU1000000044_S0001105	we are going back because of a few things we were not able to do that on my 1st trip there
YOU1000000044_S0001106	we were going to ride an excursion train down there recalled the sam short line they have a website you can probably look it up i think
YOU1000000044_S0001107	they were not running when we were down there before so we are going to try and go down there so i can film that when the train is running
YOU1000000044_S0001108	and we are going to go to a museum in tifton georgia which is a replica of a historic village
YOU1000000044_S0001109	and they have a lot of equipment there that is from i think the 1890s early 20th century
YOU1000000044_S0001110	and it sort of depicts the early life in georgia i think from the 1830s to 1890s and to like i think the early 191920s i think
YOU1000000044_S0001111	i can not remember exactly how far in time it goes but it is really well done the historians are really good at telling the story
YOU1000000044_S0001112	and all the buildings i think are original i think there is only a few that have had to be rebuilt
YOU1000000044_S0001113	but they are rebuild in such a way they do not look like they are modern they kept they were built toward the original
YOU1000000044_S0001114	which is amazing to me i was impressed at how well they kept all the buildings up and a lot of them actually had steam powered equipment
YOU1000000044_S0001115	now keep in mind my 1st trip there none of it was running
YOU1000000044_S0001116	this time we had my grandmother has a lot of friends
YOU1000000044_S0001117	and i think a friend of hers daughter who is like i think the curator or something is going to be there
YOU1000000044_S0001118	and are hosting a festival there so a lot of their equipment going to be running so that is going to be neat for me to check out and i am going to film it
YOU1000000044_S0001119	and i am hoping this sort of play out like my return trip to cass where although i did not get a lot film on the 1st time i am hoping to get more done on the 2nd time
YOU1000000044_S0001120	okay

YOU1000000044_S0001136	well this is interesting
YOU1000000044_S0001138	i may have accidentally muted the stream for a bit that was
YOU1000000044_S0001139	not my intention okay keep that in mind i did not not meant to do that that was a major fail on my part
YOU1000000044_S0001140	0 do not feel bad we have all been there like i said look at us right now we are just
YOU1000000044_S0001141	i mean if you watch i you could actually see my reaction and i was talking myself about in this live stream when i accidentally did it okay
YOU1000000044_S0001142	i it was on my face cam though so yeah
YOU1000000044_S0001143	biker bushcraft is saying that he is enjoying your historical perspectives
YOU1000000044_S0001144	yeah
YOU1000000044_S0001145	and he understands your connection to your grandmother and his was born in the 1800s and had great stories
YOU1000000044_S0001146	i honestly one of the reasons i have major respect for the people who came before me is because
YOU1000000044_S0001147	i really would i really wish someone could go and interview all these people who are around like who are still living from the 1800s
YOU1000000044_S0001148	and the 1900s
YOU1000000044_S0001149	and you know write their stories down because once that person dies their stories are lost for good and
YOU1000000044_S0001151	my step father is grandfather whose name was tom butler he was a world war 2 veteran
YOU1000000044_S0001152	
YOU1000000044_S0001153	and unfortunately i do not think he was ever interviewed so a lot of his stories are only able to be told to my step father is mouth and
YOU1000000044_S0001154	my stepmother actually has 2 japanese rifles that tom butler brought back
YOU1000000044_S0001155	yeah try doing that nowadays if you are in service no offense to any war veterans out there no offense
YOU1000000044_S0001156	no i know you are saying though i know and they understand that as well i am sure
YOU1000000044_S0001157	but yeah i mean they also put in amazing service and we do thank them very much for their service and anybody who puts their life on the line
YOU1000000044_S0001158	but yeah some these guys have seen some very hard conditions and not much to work with you know it was very primitive
YOU1000000044_S0001159	i just want to show you if you have a 2nd if you like to see it this is xenya is grandfather he was a general in the russian air force
YOU1000000044_S0001161	0 wow
YOU1000000044_S0001163	talk about the russian style
YOU1000000044_S0001165	0 that was a failed russian impression just my bad
YOU1000000044_S0001166	no it is all good that was him and there as well there
YOU1000000044_S0001167	mind if i show this on my stream
YOU1000000044_S0001168	yeah go ahead
YOU1000000044_S0001169	sure
YOU1000000044_S0001170	0 wow and that is a world war one biplane correct me is that world war one
YOU1000000044_S0001171	world war 2 world war one yeah for that one yes excuse me that is great grandfather here on the left
YOU1000000044_S0001172	yeah
YOU1000000044_S0001173	0 wow did he ever tell you any stories or your parents stories about him
YOU1000000044_S0001174	yeah my grandfather he was a scientist and inventor
YOU1000000044_S0001175	he mostly like to talk about is the innovations and and and things like that
YOU1000000044_S0001176	i think he is seen a lot in world war 2 that he did not want to talk about cause probably it was too dramatic
YOU1000000044_S0001177	it was like some of those guys in vietnam i mean you know just with those i mean that is like that with every soldier i mean just what those guys went through alone is enough
YOU1000000044_S0001178	yes definitely
YOU1000000044_S0001179	exactly and my grandmother who also lived through the war and actually as in the war time
YOU1000000044_S0001180	she was was working in one of the factories putting together guns because that is what they were made to do
YOU1000000044_S0001181	she was telling more stories about it but you know
YOU1000000044_S0001182	like when she when she immigrated so to say or was sent to latvia where i am from originally
YOU1000000044_S0001183	the city was still bombed through and she had to every morning goes through the ruins over a bombed through city to get to work
YOU1000000044_S0001184	so she was telling me more about how it was during and even after the war ended about rations and not having food and living on potatoes all and
YOU1000000044_S0001185	my grandfather i think he got what is he is seen the blood of it so to say
YOU1000000044_S0001186	so he was less talkative about the actual war things and more about his inventions
YOU1000000044_S0001187	and the picture you see up now this is
YOU1000000044_S0001188	i heard about chernobyl ouch
YOU1000000044_S0001189	he is quite a man i never got to meet him unfortunately he was taking early in life but
YOU1000000044_S0001190	ouch that is the same with my stepfather is grandfather tom he died in tow 1004 so i never got to meet him
YOU1000000044_S0001191	i mean there is one story now that he told my stepfather then my stepfather told me so it is passed down which i am really glad for
YOU1000000044_S0001192	now i do not remember how exactly it was i can not now i may not be accurate with me but i think what how it went was you know
YOU1000000044_S0001193	tom was assigned to some of the land clearing teams which were to clear out airship so
YOU1000000044_S0001194	plans could planes not plans blah there is one of those brain farts you were talking about i said plans where i meant to say planes
YOU1000000044_S0001196	he was clearing out airstrips on one of i guess the occupied islands so that our planes could land in and
YOU1000000044_S0001197	and out of nowhere a japanese sniper started shooting at him he was using a bulldozer that at the time from what i was told
YOU1000000044_S0001198	so what he did was to protect himself and shield himself was he raised the bucket of the bulldozer up so that the bullet would hit the bucket
YOU1000000044_S0001199	and i guess when he found the tree the sniper was in he used the bulldozer and rammed a tree the sniper was in and knocked the tree down
YOU1000000044_S0001200	wow
YOU1000000044_S0001201	i think what he did then was tied the sniper up and i think that was how he got the rifle that my stepfather now has
YOU1000000044_S0001202	i could be wrong on that okay i have to ask my step father for more confirmation on in terms of accuracy but
YOU1000000044_S0001203	see that is the thing it is kind like with civil war veterans you know that is what is happening now to a lot of those world war 2 guys
YOU1000000044_S0001204	you know i mean once you know you know cause the civil war once the last veteran died in 1959 you know that story is pretty been pretty much forgotten heck
YOU1000000044_S0001205	they hardly even teach me about it my school can you believe it
YOU1000000044_S0001206	i learned more about it thanks to a documentary that can but ken burns made about it than what they teach me in school
YOU1000000044_S0001207	yeah that is an unfortunate side effect but i believe you on that
YOU1000000044_S0001208	yes
YOU1000000044_S0001209	by the way getting back to the recording memories so to say or interviews with people that are older
YOU1000000044_S0001210	i recently got into a thing called story corps i do not know if you have heard about it
YOU1000000044_S0001211	it is basically a website mostly an app where it has either already pre prepared questions
YOU1000000044_S0001212	or you can make your own and make it like interview style going through those questions and recorded and saved it on a cloud
YOU1000000044_S0001213	and you can either share or leaving privately but that is i find it is a great way of preserving things that we were just talking about
YOU1000000044_S0001214	what i am doing i am doing it with my son some times
YOU1000000044_S0001215	so that way of preserving more of the way his ideas are changing through the time he is growing up
YOU1000000044_S0001216	but lots of people are actually using it to talk with the older generations so it is something to look into so called story corps
YOU1000000044_S0001217	0 okay i will look into it also you going to think i am crazy but what if i tell you i have actually met in my lifetime 3 world war 2 veterans i have actually met 3 of them
YOU1000000044_S0001218	okay
YOU1000000044_S0001219	yeah
YOU1000000044_S0001220	i met the 1st one on the plane fly back from seattle it was after our plane touched down in atlanta
YOU1000000044_S0001221	and as we were getting off i just happened to glance over and saw his hat and it showed he was a world war 2 veteran i mean i did not say anything to him i just saluted him
YOU1000000044_S0001222	and he actually turned to me and he smiled and i mean that i was glad i mean i cause i already knew those guys are starting to be forgotten
YOU1000000044_S0001223	because you know i think over i think over a 1000 are dying each day
YOU1000000044_S0001224	
YOU1000000044_S0001225	which is unfortunate after that i think the 2nd one i met i met him he was at a home depot
YOU1000000044_S0001226	think it was either in commerce or east side of georgia i can not remember exactly where but
YOU1000000044_S0001227	i ended up talking to him and he had to show me a picture of the plane he was assigned to
YOU1000000044_S0001228	i think it was either a b 17 bomber a b 25 i can not remember exactly
YOU1000000044_S0001229	but he and i were talking and i i saluted him i mean anytime i see a war veteran i salute them
YOU1000000044_S0001231	and i mean i was deeply impressed by what you know he had gone through i mean
YOU1000000044_S0001233	that was sort of an honor for me i had never gotten a chance to talk to another war veteran
YOU1000000044_S0001234	and the 3rd one i have met was one who was able to attend our veterans day assembly at my school
YOU1000000044_S0001235	and i spoke to him and few other war veterans from other wars and i mean he was the oldest one there
YOU1000000044_S0001237	i mean that sort of never left me either i mean i really kind of honored that i was able to meet those guys cause i mean they saw what true war was
YOU1000000044_S0001239	and unfortunately i mean i know a lot of other veterans and other sides have seen far worse unfortunately which is you know like i says you know

YOU1000000044_S0001305	i think that is going to be the most often question we have to change the pictures every time
YOU1000000044_S0001306	yeah yeah exactly we have to rotate cause i know somebody like bottle cap going to say 0 they are talking about it again i can hear him right now
YOU1000000044_S0001308	this is from the trip my backpacking trip i did and that is the different countries that i visited when i spent 2 weeks by train in europe
YOU1000000044_S0001309	but that one you are asking about particularly that is ljubljana slovenia
YOU1000000044_S0001310	and what i i was we each have a big picture behind one of the coaches we each pick one of our favorites and xenya is picture was from iceland
YOU1000000044_S0001311	and this was mine because i was just find it was one of the most beautiful places surprisingly beautiful i did not think it was it could be that beautiful there so
YOU1000000044_S0001312	that is why i picked that one to be the rest are all black and white from the other countries but we did one colored one each
YOU1000000044_S0001313	yeah we talked little bit in beginning of the stream about traveling and places in europe
YOU1000000044_S0001314	so if you have anything to add to that please welcome and drop a comment
YOU1000000044_S0001315	that is amazing so beautiful hazel says yes
YOU1000000044_S0001316	thank you it it is my go to picture
YOU1000000044_S0001317	as i stated i never buy souvenir the only souvenirs actually buy is i buy one fridge magnets at every country
YOU1000000044_S0001318	and that actually goes on my mom is fridge cause i have started it as a kind of tradition
YOU1000000044_S0001319	and i am not into souvenirs the pictures and the memories are my souvenir so i hold them very closely
YOU1000000044_S0001320	so every pitch i look around the room kinda tells a story or a moment in time from different travels
YOU1000000044_S0001321	some with xenya we had some great adventures
YOU1000000044_S0001322	our 1st trip we ever did together was estonia we went to talons which was absolutely incredible
YOU1000000044_S0001323	and then we took the ferry what is about what it is an hour and a half right i think to helsinki finland
YOU1000000044_S0001324	and it was unbelievable it was so amazing there 1st time
YOU1000000044_S0001325	helsinki finland was actually one on my bucket list places i always pick the cold ones which is weird coming from canada but
YOU1000000044_S0001326	is it warm this evening in california hazel yeah i was so my parting tip always shoot a 2nd take
YOU1000000044_S0001327	my 2nd take save me from re shoot last night definitely sure glad i had the footage ho you got that right
YOU1000000044_S0001328	the video i just did recently biker bushcraft obviously has seen it she brought back the 80s to montreal
YOU1000000044_S0001329	there is some panning shots of the city my poor son i think he was pulling his hair at one point cause we were literally down there for 2 hours
YOU1000000044_S0001330	and we ended up with over 50 some shots of each section just because it is that time of evening when it is hard to guess what the lightnings going to be like
YOU1000000044_S0001331	what it will look like once you put it through the editing box and like you say that they do get lost so yes definitely always backup everything
YOU1000000044_S0001332	cause you will never recreate that moment now maybe you will go and shoot it even better but most times yeah you will never recreate that moment so definitely double up
YOU1000000044_S0001333	triple up if you can
YOU1000000044_S0001334	this is the beauty of the digital technology is now that we can do that
YOU1000000044_S0001335	you know when we were using 8 millimeters
YOU1000000044_S0001336	yeah
YOU1000000044_S0001337	our film in the camera for photos unfortunately you were not able to do that and fortunately or unfortunately some may say
YOU1000000044_S0001338	now you can do as many takes or as many pictures as possible and if you can do it and then you can choose the best one
YOU1000000044_S0001339	even forget a photographer just somebody went to a wedding and they are sitting there with a roll of their film in there 3 or 5 millimeters we all remember what that was like you know
YOU1000000044_S0001340	your waiting and waiting waiting for a perfect shoot cause you only had 3 shoots left on your camera
YOU1000000044_S0001342	yeah yeah i like that biker bushcraft l 0 l every one is perfect and till you are at post how true is that
YOU1000000044_S0001343	how many times you look at the screen and thought yeah that this is this is a killer shot till you get home and that looks absolutely horrible or you lost it that it that is the truth
YOU1000000044_S0001344	as many professionals say i think to have to do the most preparation before shot as possible
YOU1000000044_S0001345	the most you can do before is better if there is something you can do in post great
YOU1000000044_S0001346	but the more you do with the light with composition with the way you are moving your camera that like everything which you can do before it and make sure before we actually shoot if its possible
YOU1000000044_S0001347	preparation is the key lots of preparation yeah and scouting the place out if i have a new place that i want to shoot i will definitely walk all round it
YOU1000000044_S0001348	i will look for things are going to look horrible later on in film i have seen myself picking up garbage by a train yard one time literally i picked up probably 25 pieces
YOU1000000044_S0001349	it was an amazing place to shoot but of course litter was blowing off the highway and yes you might not notice as much we are looking through the camera
YOU1000000044_S0001350	but when you get into post like like biker says then it really sticks out
YOU1000000044_S0001351	and that is an awful thing when you put all 23 hours work into something just bring him back and it is all non usable
YOU1000000044_S0001353	definitely and i think that is these details that makes a difference as you said picking up the garbage
YOU1000000044_S0001354	it is noticing the details that might be distracting in your video or photo and getting rid of them
YOU1000000044_S0001355	making it just a little bit different you know those details is what makes the difference
YOU1000000044_S0001356	
YOU1000000044_S0001357	when you watch the video or photo
YOU1000000044_S0001358	like i do not do much photography as xenya but when i take photos i kinda do same as i do with video
YOU1000000044_S0001359	i the windmill train that was brought up a while ago that is a great example there is a shoot in the town where i grew up a peak where it is looking the trains is crossing the trestle bridge
YOU1000000044_S0001360	there was lots of open places the shoot it but it was so much more interesting i went down by the bank and you have poplar trees they were come off intertwined a bit
YOU1000000044_S0001361	i bent back a couple them i try not to break them in half to so when i shot i have some trees in front of it you know some nice little branches
YOU1000000044_S0001362	and that is so many people try to go for this like crystal clear unobstructed view
YOU1000000044_S0001363	but when you shoot like that you have just a couple of branches here and there it gives you that peeping feel that people love like they they found something special
YOU1000000044_S0001364	and it really really brings out your shot it makes the subject so much more interesting
YOU1000000044_S0001365	you going to remember that the shoot that is taken from standing and eye level is the most common shoot you going to ever see anywhere
YOU1000000044_S0001366	yes
YOU1000000044_S0001367	so before you are taking a video or a photo think about that
YOU1000000044_S0001368	if you are standing and you are doing this probably 6000 people already did that especially it is summer and the tourist place
YOU1000000044_S0001369	so once you do this remember that and try to go either lower or are in a different angle of just just so it is different
YOU1000000044_S0001370	because after evenly with the best post edit there is going to to be 1000s of pictures of a straight up lake louise straight up grand canyon
YOU1000000044_S0001371	and all the other places it could ever imagine
YOU1000000044_S0001372	definitely
YOU1000000044_S0001373	so yes when you think think this move
YOU1000000044_S0001374	yes shoot under your leg
YOU1000000044_S0001375	even it came on a tiny bit blurry in one corner will give more perspective cause the angle was shot from versus a straight on one that is crystal clear
YOU1000000044_S0001376	video i almost always shoot as my cameras well but i am almost always shooting at chest level
YOU1000000044_S0001377	and that is kinda give a in between view of child and adult most animals would see from that perspective
YOU1000000044_S0001378	so i think it is the most relatable to most people that are watching your work now is that always the case time will tell but
YOU1000000044_S0001379	for me i just found that is kind of what is worked at the best for myself
YOU1000000044_S0001381	another tips of taking pictures by the way jump to mind because you are saying about the chest level
YOU1000000044_S0001382	if you want to have a nice and clear picture try to hold the camera not in a straight out hands but as close as possible to your body
YOU1000000044_S0001383	basically your body is a tripod
YOU1000000044_S0001384	yeah definitely for sure
YOU1000000044_S0001385	lots people do they do this because we can see the back of the screen with the view we want to see what is there right
YOU1000000044_S0001386	do not do that that is where you hands start get shaky and
YOU1000000044_S0001387	you have no control
YOU1000000044_S0001388	0 no control at all the closer you are to your body with that the better the picture nor the video is because it works like a tripod
YOU1000000044_S0001389	and yes that is fan boy talk once again we will bring up peter mckenna he gave a great example for how he was doing the dropping shots
YOU1000000044_S0001390	was to put the camera strap around your neck hold your camera out so that you do have some support already you know you do not want to far away
YOU1000000044_S0001391	adjust your straps which is about here which is usually for most people lifting up their camera you going to shoot just on one foot just off just pivot ahead
YOU1000000044_S0001392	and you only have about 23 seconds but you could actually catch a lot in that 23 seconds
YOU1000000044_S0001393	and you got a nice panning shots of you want to like a flower or maybe a small brook somewhere and you want to get that nice panning shot is doing that
YOU1000000044_S0001394	just let yourself standing on one foot and let yourself just lightly go ahead on your own momentum and you can really get some great shoot
YOU1000000044_S0001395	and do that from different angles hold the camera with with the slung the strap and just turn it slowly
YOU1000000044_S0001396	you are not going to be able to keep it forever but you you will always know you keep that little bit of steady momentum as you do it and that really helps a lot
YOU1000000044_S0001398	hazel is asking if we are carrying around charge batteries
YOU1000000044_S0001399	definitely all kinds of charged batteries
YOU1000000044_S0001400	let me count okay so one is always in the camera charged
YOU1000000044_S0001401	ever every time i come back from somewhere where i had gone to shoot i come back and i charge right away the the batteries
YOU1000000044_S0001402	that is just a given so there is always one charged inside and i think i have 4 or 5 extra
YOU1000000044_S0001403	she is never a shortage of them that is for sure
YOU1000000044_S0001404	why because we sometimes shoot weddings and believe me i go through all of them and some times even need to charge extra
YOU1000000044_S0001405	and that is lithium battery on the sony camera that i am using
YOU1000000044_S0001406	so that is a lot that is a lot of batteries to go through in a 8 hour some times
YOU1000000044_S0001407	but and why by the way because often times as a wedding photographer or event photographer we go to baptism
YOU1000000044_S0001408	by the way we will have a shoot on on this sunday yes sunday
YOU1000000044_S0001409	i do not want to lose a shot so i oftentimes just keep the shutter open and just wait for the for the right moment
YOU1000000044_S0001410	i do not want to lose their motion or their face expression so i just keep it open obviously batteries draining as i am doing that and
YOU1000000044_S0001411	that is why i sometimes go through 56 of them during the event
YOU1000000044_S0001412	but yes we definitely always always extra charging batteries even with the phone chargers always with me and we charge charges in the car
YOU1000000044_S0001413	because i you know it is not for being able to talk through it but to to take pictures even with a phone when i do not have my camera with me what about you
YOU1000000044_S0001414	me i keep 54 batteries and mine is a bit tricky for the simple reason that the controller is my cellphone that is how that one is controlled
YOU1000000044_S0001415	so i have to keep extra batteries for the cell phone plus extra batteries for the camera itself
YOU1000000044_S0001416	the 4 lithium batteries for the camera as soon as one runs out i am literally plug in and charging it
YOU1000000044_S0001417	and i will try all day i will planted out so when we do a wedding i will look around and see the different areas we are going to be filming where the plugins are available and i always try to reserve them in advance
YOU1000000044_S0001418	i will ask the d j or i will ask concierge is whoever has any control over them that at least saved me one
YOU1000000044_S0001419	and from there i am just plugging in recharging i would never take a chance i i should get more batteries really
YOU1000000044_S0001420	4 seems to work okay cause i have always been lucky to plug them in but at some point up my lucks going to run out
YOU1000000044_S0001421	and it does you never know when magic went remember we had a wedding one time well the one with jeffrey in them
YOU1000000044_S0001422	yeah
YOU1000000044_S0001423	and i thought they were pretty much done with us and then all of a sudden they decided this mother in law was giving them this gift and they want it on film
YOU1000000044_S0001424	and just by the grace of god i had enough battery left in the last of battery to get the shot
YOU1000000044_S0001425	maybe not as many as i would like to but at least we got it covered
YOU1000000044_S0001426	things creep on you really quickly you got to be prepared for everything and batteries is the key
YOU1000000044_S0001427	batteries and s d cards
YOU1000000044_S0001428	cause s d card can crap out on you at any time you can shoot a lot more footage than you have ever expecting to shoot
YOU1000000044_S0001429	that is 2 things we always keep a lot of i actually keep mine in my glasses case not for these glasses the ones i had before
YOU1000000044_S0001430	the snap close type that come with them that we usually never use well that one and that is where i keep all my s d cards and i keep all my little bits that i need for that kind of stuff
YOU1000000044_S0001431	bottle cap is asking
YOU1000000044_S0001432	okay you okay you have watched a variety of my videos now i want you to tell me what i am doing wrong
YOU1000000044_S0001433	and that is a thing i think we are all asking each other i know it sounds sound kind of a generic answer
YOU1000000044_S0001434	i do not think you are doing anything wrong like i say were not the aces either we are still learning and i mean we got these really great complements and i appreciate it
YOU1000000044_S0001436	a lot of it been the marketing our site that really is just getting people to watch it that has been the biggest part of all for growing
YOU1000000044_S0001437	you got you got interesting content i do not see why people would not be interested in to it it depends what you want to edit like i mean
YOU1000000044_S0001438	if you are going to go more into what what i do it does it is more of a learning curve than others people that are light years ahead of me
YOU1000000044_S0001439	but it is a lot more work and so it takes you know and you need to make sure you have decent computer for it
YOU1000000044_S0001440	it is a lot a lot and the same with xenya in photography a lot of youtube tutorials tutorials
YOU1000000044_S0001441	i am constantly on it trying either to learn when i need i will think okay well i want this to flash and turn and do whatever
YOU1000000044_S0001442	i am on youtube looking for somebody has done it already or something at least close enough
YOU1000000044_S0001443	and also watching my spare time to always look to see what somebody else is doing
YOU1000000044_S0001444	and it is an art in itself editing you know there is people who edit who are horrible at taking video
YOU1000000044_S0001445	and that is what is tricky about what we all do here and we got to remember that we have people here who love working with wood
YOU1000000044_S0001446	but now all of the sudden they have to learn how to be video of a photographers they have to learn how to be editors they got to learn how to read analytics in the youtube
YOU1000000044_S0001447	we wear so many hats now
YOU1000000044_S0001448	and we all wished kind sometimes we have somebody myself taking video with my camera i do enjoy it now more
YOU1000000044_S0001449	it is more suited to the way i like to take i like to do my videography
YOU1000000044_S0001450	but i would be more than happy if somebody was shooting the stuff here like we can hire somebody doing that and i was sitting here just editing cause that is where i feel the most creative
YOU1000000044_S0001451	now somebody is the exact opposite they will shoot for days they have such an amazing eye and they would rather cut off their own arm than have to do any video editing
YOU1000000044_S0001452	or marketing on youtube it it is a whole package you see what i am
YOU1000000044_S0001453	hazel we are not experts
YOU1000000044_S0001454	yeah you are too kind
YOU1000000044_S0001456	yeah we are we are just try to help each other the same as we learn from other people what we are doing you know if anybody have question does not mean we have the perfect answer i will not call us experts
YOU1000000044_S0001457	and if you have something that you can do that we have forgotten or know more about please i am all ears we would love that the whole point is for us to learn as well
YOU1000000044_S0001459	i asked a question but never got back to me is there some kind of lag in the chat system
YOU1000000044_S0001460	i would say so usually there is at any given time
YOU1000000044_S0001462	yeah i think we answered all the questions by the way i want to address are your channel in general and please do not start
YOU1000000044_S0001464	i wanted to tell you just one thing and and i know you do not want to hear about marketing you know how i remembered your channel
YOU1000000044_S0001465	i remembered your channel and out of all of the 1000s that we watched it is hard sometimes to remember which is which then you have got to go back again and again
YOU1000000044_S0001466	but what really strike a stroke a chord is a thumbnail of your video of gillies bay
YOU1000000044_S0001467	with a bird i saw the shot itself as photographer 1st of all i thought it was amazing
YOU1000000044_S0001468	like i am like i remember andrew was showing me your channel 0 my god look at that i like i i could not believe the shots
YOU1000000044_S0001469	but what i am saying that i am looking at all your videos altogether it jumps out that thumbnail is just like 0 my god i want to see what is there
YOU1000000044_S0001470	yeah
YOU1000000044_S0001471	and i think you should have that as an example to the rest of your videos have your thumbnails like that
YOU1000000044_S0001472	you have your your channels name on them which is great
YOU1000000044_S0001473	but these capturing thumbnails like you have not these gillies bay video thumbnail do them like that on the rest of your videos
YOU1000000044_S0001474	it it is amazing i am telling you as a professional photographer i could not i could not believe my eyes like i needed to see that close and and that is how i remembered it
YOU1000000044_S0001475	and that is why i was coming back and watching other videos because of that and thumbnail
YOU1000000044_S0001476	yeah thumbnails are so important and we all kinda make that mistake there i have been there many times
YOU1000000044_S0001477	the thumbnails that you see for our videos i have redone i think it is for times now to get them where i want to get them
YOU1000000044_S0001478	and some things i have learned like one of my favorite ones is the one of latest ones we did was the train in the fog in kingston ontario
YOU1000000044_S0001479	before i would have taken a screen shot it would have been further back
YOU1000000044_S0001480	yes you can see the train yes you could probably guessed there was a bit fog in there
YOU1000000044_S0001481	but now if you look at it
YOU1000000044_S0001482	because the thumbnail smaller i added i take the shot bringing into photoshop the 1st thing i do is i up the contrast a lot
YOU1000000044_S0001483	because it is smaller i really wanted the punch then i bring up the blacks so the shadows i still want you to see detail
YOU1000000044_S0001484	but i want to get to the exact point the sweetest spot where it is as jet black as can be while you can still make out what is in there
YOU1000000044_S0001485	and then the fog was actually my god i feel like it is a drinking games so i am going to bring up peter mckenna one more time
YOU1000000044_S0001486	but talk about getting ideas we were watching and he was shown about how to do motion blur to give your picture more depth
YOU1000000044_S0001487	and that i have done that before but i had not done so long and i have seen it and 2 days while i was working thumbnail i thought that is it that is what i am missing
YOU1000000044_S0001488	so i took the shot then layered on top of each other and then i added the motion blur to it
YOU1000000044_S0001489	and started as a layer mask cleaning it out and gave it that mask with a train comes punching through the fog
YOU1000000044_S0001490	because people are not going to see the big picture that you are working on to at the time
YOU1000000044_S0001491	like you see on the screen they are literally seeing this at the best of times
YOU1000000044_S0001492	so hi res very very high contrast pictures is what works great
YOU1000000044_S0001493	and that picture like xenya said that was the seagull that you nailed it there really nail that and use that as your example and go back and do your thumbnails
YOU1000000044_S0001494	i notice your bottle cap logo i like it it is very punchy
YOU1000000044_S0001495	i would almost though consider maybe finding the spot that you like to use and use it at the same place on all your photos
YOU1000000044_S0001496	like if you notice ours has pusha studio with the white band across the bottom and usually the 4 k on top
YOU1000000044_S0001497	except for a few of them where i did a photo series or that the hour long train i could not make it into 4 k it was too long
YOU1000000044_S0001498	and all it is is one photoshop document i back up of course
YOU1000000044_S0001499	but with every layer is all of them photo those thumbnails
YOU1000000044_S0001500	and i always just go in and add a new layer or a new folder in there and work on that
YOU1000000044_S0001501	so everything always stays in the same uniform scale every time
YOU1000000044_S0001502	so the 4 k logo is always the same place the banner is always in the same place and the only thing that changes is the layers behind it
YOU1000000044_S0001503	maybe you can share one of his videos if you really want to hear
YOU1000000044_S0001504	yeah
YOU1000000044_S0001505	well we going to ask him 1st to see if he minds bottle caps would you mind if we opened up one of your videos to look at
YOU1000000044_S0001506	it is up to you you do not have to we understand completely if you liked to or not and if there is a certain video you would like of us to look at just let us know
YOU1000000044_S0001508	i definitely would not do that without your permission
YOU1000000044_S0001509	hazel also agrees with us that at the thumbnail with the birds that really jumps and adds the strength exactly
YOU1000000044_S0001510	as i said that is how i remember your channel bottle caps
YOU1000000044_S0001511	you are saying that you you have a huge photograph hanging on the wall of a bald headed eagle
YOU1000000044_S0001512	bringing a gift to the drone 1000 feet up a dead duck in it 0 my god i would love to see that
YOU1000000044_S0001513	and that is amazing this is what people want push up put it on
YOU1000000044_S0001514	you were saying other day your videos are always for local people
YOU1000000044_S0001515	no we are interested as i said we do not live there i am interested in your video
YOU1000000044_S0001516	exactly we are all local i mean our work is mostly based in montreal
YOU1000000044_S0001517	in the tiny town of 280 some in eastern quebec and the people who are commenting i mean just once again the analytic show where there looking from around the world so
YOU1000000044_S0001518	you you have some great views then you
YOU1000000044_S0001520	
YOU1000000044_S0001522	sure i do not sure i do not care bottle cap you are amazing
YOU1000000044_S0001524	okay already
YOU1000000044_S0001526	he is amazing i swear to god
YOU1000000044_S0001527	yeah use the last latest one
YOU1000000044_S0001528	yeah okay just give a 2nd to get that up
YOU1000000044_S0001530	
YOU1000000044_S0001532	and again they just suggestions we are not experts
YOU1000000044_S0001533	no and we are not bashing anybody i mean we do not have all the answers i mean i am sure people looking at ours thinking god what are they doing you know you can not please everybody
YOU1000000044_S0001534	carol says that you look like jack nicholson are you talking about my husband does he look like jack nicholson amazing resemblance
YOU1000000044_S0001535	let me look
YOU1000000044_S0001536	i do not know maybe so i am going to be looking through a different set of eyes now
YOU1000000044_S0001538	yeah yeah yeah 0 yeah the question is from which movie
YOU1000000044_S0001540	bottle caps will definitely be picking something like that so okay so let us see here bear with me i want to get it set up
YOU1000000044_S0001542	this will be another 1st
YOU1000000044_S0001544	applications screen share
YOU1000000044_S0001545	okay now we are going to try the sound i hope this works okay
YOU1000000044_S0001547	great shot
YOU1000000044_S0001549	great opening shot
YOU1000000044_S0001551	that that that opening shot is absolutely i do not see any problem with it
YOU1000000044_S0001552	i loved the movement i love the pause in the beginning the composition of the shot the set up is great
YOU1000000044_S0001553	i would work a little bit on the histogram
YOU1000000044_S0001554	yeas color that is why i said shot specifically meaning that they did that the direction you are going into i know xenya would talk about color
YOU1000000044_S0001555	as you notice right here in the spot you can see that there is
YOU1000000044_S0001557	so you can see the only thing right now is your missing is some definition between your clouds your water and your grass
YOU1000000044_S0001558	it is a nice shot and really it is not a ton of he does not need a rebuilding or anything it is just as just bring up your blacks a bit more
YOU1000000044_S0001559	you know from the grass here that waterside grass it would make them more defined that way
YOU1000000044_S0001560	me personally i would boost up your blacks a bit and even though it is a nice blue sky i would bring back maybe even a bit of a yellow tint just a tiny bit
YOU1000000044_S0001561	just to kind of bring a little little little bit of life into the plants over there or try your greens a bit
YOU1000000044_S0001562	but usually yellow gives you a more cinematic look but you do not add too much of it and that is a big key and this is a side note
YOU1000000044_S0001563	that happens a lot when people get crazy with the slider they start moving at left right as far as it can go
YOU1000000044_S0001564	almost everything you do should be within maybe what 10% i would say is a good number to keep in mind
YOU1000000044_S0001565	cause you will distorted so badly in the end they will not even look recognizable anymore
YOU1000000044_S0001566	yeah yeah my suggestion would be bringing the highlight a little bit down and bringing the shadows a bit up
YOU1000000044_S0001567	the trick in getting the detail but not getting your shot too too dark is getting your shadows a little bit up
YOU1000000044_S0001568	it is not going to be enough to blow it out completely
YOU1000000044_S0001569	but it is going to give that nice detail in the in the darkest parts as for example in your trees here
YOU1000000044_S0001570	that would be more visible
YOU1000000044_S0001571	and also here maybe the highlights are good i would even say they are great
YOU1000000044_S0001572	but right here if you would just put the highlights a little bit down
YOU1000000044_S0001573	i would be able to see more of the water more of the clouds more of that beautiful beautiful scenery in the background there
YOU1000000044_S0001574	so yeah so that is what i would say with regards to that and we can play it along again where are we okay
YOU1000000044_S0001576	yeah beautiful movement the composition of the shot is amazing
YOU1000000044_S0001578	and you see right away hear you are doing what a lot of people are doing online
YOU1000000044_S0001579	not to degrade your work saying that you you do not need to feel like you you are a made some serve abomination
YOU1000000044_S0001580	look at the pass on the birds you got a little bit contrast those birds will pop right out of the water
YOU1000000044_S0001582	you have great shoot here
YOU1000000044_S0001583	nice speed not too fast not too slow amazing
YOU1000000044_S0001584	here is 0 right here here is what i would avoid and this is common with most drone shots everything was flowing i want to put this back
YOU1000000044_S0001585	let me see a bit further cause i want to catch it where it happens and you see the flow you had since you left land
YOU1000000044_S0001586	and you went out there beautiful right here where you are starting to turn that is where i would fade out
YOU1000000044_S0001587	i would never keep that turn in there and as you turn here once you straightened out and you find your angle that you are going in
YOU1000000044_S0001589	that is where i would be bringing the video back in like here like let us go back see how you kinda panting up slowly
YOU1000000044_S0001590	you could use that as a shot cutting out all the middle between where i had stopped in here
YOU1000000044_S0001591	this is nice it is getting
YOU1000000044_S0001593	the problem with drones and this has been a big big argument for a while
YOU1000000044_S0001595	if you are making a video you just want to show flying a drone in an area leave it it is good
YOU1000000044_S0001596	if you want to make it more cinematic think of all the movies you have seen where there has been a lifted camera
YOU1000000044_S0001597	they never show all the turnings cause i mean a drone is not a perfect turn when it does one is very very disjointed
YOU1000000044_S0001598	as it is turning it is rising and does not quite know where to go and steadying out
YOU1000000044_S0001599	cut out the fat remember i was saying with my camera i never shoot a building i wanted straight on i always start away from it and pan across it
YOU1000000044_S0001600	because i will actually cut out that beginning part where i started and it is a little bit jittery and wait till the movement is fluid and that is where i will start my video
YOU1000000044_S0001601	and where it is starting to get kind of going the same way the end that is where i will cut off
YOU1000000044_S0001602	that is that makes tons and tons and tons a difference in your footage
YOU1000000044_S0001603	cause you got a great footage right here this turn you can use that and then may be cut it again afterwards
YOU1000000044_S0001605	see like this is a beautiful panning shots like this you can use
YOU1000000044_S0001607	but you got a separate them when it looks like moving off and the drone is steadying itself cut it out
YOU1000000044_S0001608	and maybe you will have to skip 5 seconds but at least you will have good footage and then you can show it here
YOU1000000044_S0001609	so starting with that i would do the 1st turn and then see that there was bit of jittering and another nice turn but almost the same level
YOU1000000044_S0001610	i would actually take that next i cut out the bad part and the next one i would zoom in may be
YOU1000000044_S0001612	or zoom out as well 20% so it does not look like the same kind cause it looks like a jump shot with the same view
YOU1000000044_S0001613	so bringing in a bit more or bringing out a bit more
YOU1000000044_S0001615	yeah you definitely in detail and color look at all that color in the water like i i just want to punch in it
YOU1000000044_S0001616	yeah yeah
YOU1000000044_S0001617	got blue and green will bring so much life in it right away
YOU1000000044_S0001618	also all the details in the woods there just they are just screaming to get out
YOU1000000044_S0001619	yeah no
YOU1000000044_S0001621	you would be able to see so much also underneath the water that the bed water bed
YOU1000000044_S0001622	if you will go down in a highlights right here in the shot you would be able to see much more of the things under the water
YOU1000000044_S0001624	yeah okay see where the camera got jittery right here that is where i would have cut that part out and then maybe start here if you have enough distance and the stays smooth
YOU1000000044_S0001625	cut out all your jittery parts and then you have them on the time line and from there you have all your good cuts figure how you work them into the music
YOU1000000044_S0001627	music is key you want everything to follow the beat you can zoom in and see every note how goes up and down and you will see a pattern into it
YOU1000000044_S0001628	and from there you can really sync up with music and that is the biggest key to building something really great really quick
YOU1000000044_S0001629	i am just going to put the i want to try something here control this is not the best way to do it but we are going to try it control
YOU1000000044_S0001630	
YOU1000000044_S0001631	i do not know if this will work but you know what we are going to try something here tonight we are going to try something new
YOU1000000044_S0001632	you can still see the chat right honey
YOU1000000044_S0001633	yeah
YOU1000000044_S0001634	okay
YOU1000000044_S0001636	now is is not the hi rez version of what you did i just took a screen a screen capture
YOU1000000044_S0001638	so we going to try this so bear with us
YOU1000000044_S0001640	there is your shot
YOU1000000044_S0001642	now control f see i am just try this is what we are doing this is unfortunate cause of the picture obviously i am going to try all those levels just for the fun of it
YOU1000000044_S0001644	so i am just going to yeah i am just going to bring up the color going to bring up the saturation a little bit
YOU1000000044_S0001645	you guys see that
YOU1000000044_S0001647	i can not see it here
YOU1000000044_S0001648	you can not see it
YOU1000000044_S0001649	no
YOU1000000044_S0001651	can you see anything on your stream
YOU1000000044_S0001653	i tried photoshop today it was working
YOU1000000044_S0001654	i think it is just because the bandwidth we tried it today it quickly i tried to quickly and it was working i want to try once more let us just
YOU1000000044_S0001656	we are just going to to try it one more time and see cause this is hard to do and i have been reading a lot of people
YOU1000000044_S0001657	that is why i want to go to the other programs soon just have not a chance to set it up yet and they will be there
YOU1000000044_S0001659	let us see if that is where i get it showing up on here
YOU1000000044_S0001661	yeah okay
YOU1000000044_S0001663	there so honey did you want cause you are the color person here do you want to just
YOU1000000044_S0001664	i will just show the easy way of doing it it does not really need a lot of anything
YOU1000000044_S0001665	not making much of a difference that is why i am just going to bring up the bottom levels a little bit
YOU1000000044_S0001666	look how already the blacks coming out through the back i am just playing with mids a little bit we will just pull them back
YOU1000000044_S0001668	maybe i will do a separate live where i can go through with the tutorial of how to get your picture punchier
YOU1000000044_S0001669	yeah
YOU1000000044_S0001671	we can do a shot review one day
YOU1000000044_S0001672	you see you have putting all of the saturations black but if you just raise the saturation a little bit you know you colors are already coming back the the lights
YOU1000000044_S0001673	you are already getting more mood now remember like i say this is a low res version because i took a screenshot so it is quite hard to work with
YOU1000000044_S0001675	but it does not take much it it it really it is it is just paying with it you know
YOU1000000044_S0001677	but already your trees are coming out more i should have made a copy of it but let us see here
YOU1000000044_S0001679	there is the beginning
YOU1000000044_S0001681	and there is the end and you can see already the building coming out more and stuff like that and like i say this is just a very very fast edit on the fly
YOU1000000044_S0001682	right and and like i said the composition of the flow of the video is amazing but
YOU1000000044_S0001683	if you toggle between before and after you can see how much punchier the
YOU1000000044_S0001685	it it just grabs the eye more so bottle caps you are talking the other day about the viewer attention and that you need more hours and then people subscribe and leave
YOU1000000044_S0001686	but these are the things that keep them staying
YOU1000000044_S0001687	this is what keeps them watching your video to the end this is what keeps them not just subscribing but watching this video and going to next one and next one and next one
YOU1000000044_S0001688	because your videos are amazing i love drone shots who does not my god and and your movement of it is amazing too
YOU1000000044_S0001689	all the elements are there and like i said once again it is about your editing best way to make it easier for yourself lay all your files out in your editor
YOU1000000044_S0001690	cut out all the bad parts right away what you do not need what is looks bad if you have 20 seconds and 5 of it is jittery cut out the jittery and start from there
YOU1000000044_S0001691	and see what you can put together
YOU1000000044_S0001692	of course bottle caps you were say that you were just taking the s d card basically and putting into the computer and and uploading
YOU1000000044_S0001693	it it is a great way of doing it
YOU1000000044_S0001694	but if you want those viewing hours that these little details that count a lot and would make a world of difference
YOU1000000044_S0001695	just even at 10 minute work on your video would would make a difference i promise you i promise you start now
YOU1000000044_S0001696	i can see it because you have everything else already working for you 10 minutes and it is going to be so much worth it
YOU1000000044_S0001698	try it for your next video and then get back to us and and see how it went okay
YOU1000000044_S0001700	i see lots of people have drones here maverick as well
YOU1000000044_S0001701	i like that you guys are getting in matt cook from oregon 0 i am so glad to have you back tonight and yeah i know you were wanting to get more into the details of stuff like that
YOU1000000044_S0001703	and and please if you have any questions as well like i said i do not know if we going to answer them all you do some nice work
YOU1000000044_S0001704	but anything or any advice for us as well for anybody here to everybody we are just sharing thoughts and stuff like that
YOU1000000044_S0001705	that is the nice part about this it is nothing formal
YOU1000000044_S0001706	for sure if anybody else who want to jump in and having any advice and please
YOU1000000044_S0001707	again if anybody have not subscribes yet to bottle caps go over do that if you like his videos
YOU1000000044_S0001708	and please view the videos view the videos they are really really beautiful
YOU1000000044_S0001710	0 matt you are too you are too kind thank you so much i mean we are just learning as we go
YOU1000000044_S0001711	and literally that is what we are say to bottle caps we just watching every youtube tutorial there is
YOU1000000044_S0001712	i know we go on a lot of old peter mckenna yes he is canadians so we are little biased
YOU1000000044_S0001713	but what we liked about him and a lot of people say 0 well he is just casey copycat he is not
YOU1000000044_S0001714	the thing he is doing that casey did not do casey was all about flash and i am not knocking him hey he did great for it
YOU1000000044_S0001715	but he does not hold a candle in the wind when it comes actual cinematography casey is amazing story teller
YOU1000000044_S0001716	they are all great their own rights i am not turning it into a pissing contest between them all i am just saying is for what we do we really appreciate how peter does it
YOU1000000044_S0001717	that guy i swear to god could take video blowing his nose and turned into a cinematic event from the tissue to get the garbage you would be hooked on every moment of it
YOU1000000044_S0001718	that is a talent
YOU1000000044_S0001719	and that is what is is looking through it that is what i try to say about cutting out all the bad jittery shots
YOU1000000044_S0001720	that is what takes somebody imagine of you at a concert hearing your favorite singer of all time which we have and they have an off night
YOU1000000044_S0001721	it is they are singing the song and there go in the way it should be and then they hit that one flat note and then they get going again they had one more flat note
YOU1000000044_S0001722	well they song the 100s of notes but it is that flat note that just knock something off kilter and that is not you being picky that the physical element of us
YOU1000000044_S0001724	yeah exactly it is it is the details it is the details
YOU1000000044_S0001725	we layout a video or i mean or xenya with the picture
YOU1000000044_S0001726	when we do a wedding she and i both spend a good couple days
YOU1000000044_S0001727	a wedding for xenya usually involves 3 to 4000 pictures taken in 8 hours that is no joke
YOU1000000044_S0001728	so it is a week just weeding out what pictures are horrible right away yeah that is a blurry yeah that shaky some of it you take 15 of the same shot
YOU1000000044_S0001729	yeah i mean any photographer is going to tell you that combing out the photos after the event is probably the most tedious and of boring task
YOU1000000044_S0001730	and i do not want to do it so bottle caps i do not like combing my photos
YOU1000000044_S0001731	but in order to get to the part that i do like doing and to get the end result of the pictures i have to
YOU1000000044_S0001732	so i spend hours and hours of combing those 1000s and 1000s of pictures to get through them and choose the ones at that i am liking and clients are going to like
YOU1000000044_S0001733	when we do when we are shooting the wedding the same for me i mean i have seen myself
YOU1000000044_S0001735	one.5 sometime close to 2 s d cards full and those are 64 gig cards so there is a lot of footage to go through
YOU1000000044_S0001736	and it is tedious and videos is even worst cause at least with photos you can kind of jump you know with your viewer on the jpeg viewers at least get rid of the bad ones right away
YOU1000000044_S0001737	i got to watch these things and 4 k that suck up so much juice out of a computer just to get in tow minutes down the road just realized horrible the whole thing was
YOU1000000044_S0001738	cause i have shot 30 the church i have shot at 30 different ways and that angle and 50 ways in this angle
YOU1000000044_S0001739	it sometimes takes me a night just to do one building sometimes that is that is the price we pay for trying to get the best shot out of it
YOU1000000044_S0001740	and we will weed through them and i have see myself have to go back and dig through my scraps again because i am short on time
YOU1000000044_S0001741	i need to angle or once i got to the editor i am realizing 0 my god that was bad at the end i thought this one was good
YOU1000000044_S0001742	so i got to chop there and then find something else to piece in between or does it is
YOU1000000044_S0001743	what drives me the craziest is a shot that is 12nd away from matching with the music
YOU1000000044_S0001744	and do i slowed down it is like to look hooky or do i have to scrap it all and put into shots or find a better shot to fit
YOU1000000044_S0001745	it is mixing and matching it is it is like playing tetris for a couple of days
YOU1000000044_S0001747	yeah and and of course you know you do not want to go into deep editing of the staff if that is not what you will want to do but sometimes just a light touch it is it is great
YOU1000000044_S0001748	yes there is a happy medium in all this
YOU1000000044_S0001749	i mean in this stuff we are paid for it and then also what we are doing our customer will be watching so we are kind having to keep ourselves in check
YOU1000000044_S0001750	and we are our own worst critics i mean we constantly like i said the other night telling each other
YOU1000000044_S0001751	80% of it is our work and the other 20% is telling other one that they are going too far into this you got to just accept it and move on
YOU1000000044_S0001752	you know it is like a good good bowl of soup just a little bit of salt is going to make world of a difference
YOU1000000044_S0001753	and it is the little touches that make watch lots of people who did tutorials and and just look for great ideas
YOU1000000044_S0001754	there are so many out there that is what we use all the time and it does make a difference it really does and they are doing a step by step she always got a good reference
