POD1000000005_S0000024	IN THE EARLY DAYS OF TRIBUNE WHEN KIM AND HIS WIFE WERE STILL CHASING THEIR AMERICAN DREAM THEY GOT AN ORDER FROM A SMALL CLOTHING BOUTIQUE RUN BY ANOTHER KOREAN COUPLE
POD1000000005_S0000025	IT WAS CALLED FOREVER TWENTY ONE

POD1000000005_S0000044	
POD1000000005_S0000046	DID YOU SAY YOU REGRET

POD1000000005_S0000050	A LOT OF FOLKS FROM THE KOREAN JOB MARKET MADE A LOT OF MONEY OFF OF FOREVER TWENTY ONE
POD1000000005_S0000051	THE TEN BRAND SYNONYMOUS WITH THREE DOLLARS CAMISOLES NONSENSICAL GRAPHIC TEAS AND FESTIVAL WAR FOR PEOPLE WHO WILL NEVER MAKE IT TO COACHELLA
POD1000000005_S0000052	BUT IN THE END MAYBE IT'S OK THAT KIM DIDN'T HITCH HIS WAGON TO THE CLOTHING GIANT
POD1000000005_S0000053	FOREVER TWENTY ONE'S RISE TO FAST FASHION DOMINANCE WAS DIZZYING
POD1000000005_S0000054	BUT THE BRAND'S UNBRIDLED EXPANSION MOM AND POP MANAGEMENT APPROACH AND WEAK ECOMMERCE GAME SET IT UP TO FALL HARD
POD1000000005_S0000055	DESPITE THOSE FOUR NINETY NINE LEGGINGS
POD1000000005_S0000056	I'M LAUREN OBER AND FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA THIS IS SPECTACULAR FAILURES THE SHOW THAT LOOKS CUTE EVEN THOUGH FAILURES ALWAYS TRYING TO JACK OUR STYLE
POD1000000005_S0000058	THERE'S A NEIGHBORHOOD IN LOS ANGELES ABOUT THREE MILES WEST OF DOWNTOWN THAT IS THE BEATING HEART OF THE CITY'S KOREAN COMMUNITY
POD1000000005_S0000059	IT'S GOT EVERYTHING KOREAN KARAOKE BARS AND KOREAN BARBECUE JOINTS BOAT SHOPS AND BANKS

POD1000000005_S0000065	I ACCEPT I'M NOT SURE
POD1000000005_S0000066	CAME TO GET A TOUR OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD FROM HARPIN
POD1000000005_S0000067	SHE'S A LEADER IN THE KOREAN COMMUNITY HERE
POD1000000005_S0000068	SHE RUNS FAITH AND COMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT WHICH IS A LOCAL NONPROFIT
POD1000000005_S0000069	THIS
POD1000000005_S0000071	THIS NEIGHBORHOOD IS BY KOREANS FOR KOREANS
POD1000000005_S0000072	THOUGH A HEFTY NUMBER OF NON KOREANS COME FOR THE AFOREMENTIONED SPATS AND THE K POP SHOPS AND THE MOUTH NUMBING KIMCHI
POD1000000005_S0000073	SO IT'S REALLY FOR US IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE POLITICAL SOCIAL HEADQUARTER OR CENTER FOR OUR COMMUNITY
POD1000000005_S0000074	AND ALSO CREATE TOWN IN ESSENCE IS THE HEADQUARTERS FOR KOREAN AMERICA USA
POD1000000005_S0000075	LOS ANGELES HAS THE LARGEST KOREAN COMMUNITY OF ANY CITY IN THE U S
POD1000000005_S0000076	BUT BECAUSE OF LANGUAGE AND CULTURAL BARRIERS SAYS HER COMMUNITY HAS OFTEN FELT ISOLATED
POD1000000005_S0000077	THIS NEIGHBORHOOD THOUGH IS A HOME BASE
POD1000000005_S0000078	IN ESSENCE LIKE AS A KOREAN AMERICAN KNOWING THERE'S KOREATOWN AND ALL THE PEOPLE THAT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO MEET BECAUSE THIS SPACE ALLOWS OUR COMMUNITIES TO COME TOGETHER AND TO BE VISIBLE I DON'T FEEL ALONE
POD1000000005_S0000079	I WANTED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW THIS PLACE WITH ITS TIGHTEN KOREAN CHURCHES AND ITS EVER YOUTHFUL BEAUTY BOUTIQUE BIRTHED ONE OF THE LARGEST FAST FASHION BRANDS IN THE WORLD
POD1000000005_S0000081	AFTER THE US AND KOREA ESTABLISHED OFFICIAL DIPLOMATIC TIES IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO THE FIRST WAVE OF KOREAN IMMIGRATION BEGAN TO ROLL IN
POD1000000005_S0000082	FIRST TO HAWAII THEN TO LOS ANGELES
POD1000000005_S0000083	IT WAS FOLLOWED BY A SECOND SURGE AFTER THE KOREAN WAR
POD1000000005_S0000084	THE WATTS RIOTS OF NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE PUSHED A LOT OF KOREANS TO THE SUBURBS
POD1000000005_S0000085	BUT THE NUMBER OF NEW ARRIVALS TO THE CITY FROM SOUTH KOREA CONTINUED TO GROW THANKS TO A LOOSENING OF IMMIGRATION LAWS
POD1000000005_S0000086	BY THE TIME I ARRIVED IN THE U S IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR THE COMMUNITY WAS ALREADY ON THE WAY UP
POD1000000005_S0000087	THANKS TO SOME HUSTLING BY A FEW LOCAL KOREAN BUSINESSMEN KOREATOWN GOT ITS OWN OFFICIAL BLUE NEIGHBORHOOD SIGNS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY
POD1000000005_S0000088	SO THERE WAS KIND OF THAT SIGNAGE
POD1000000005_S0000089	ALTHOUGH ALREADY THERE WAS THE CHURCH AND THE GROCERY STORE YOU KNOW STARTED TO ANGER THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY RIGHT AND THE RESTAURANT
POD1000000005_S0000090	JUST AFTER KOREATOWN BECAME LEGIT A COUPLE NAMED DOWN AND JUNG CHANG EMIGRATED FROM SOUL
POD1000000005_S0000091	THEY CAME IN SEARCH OF THE SAME THING OUR PAL D J KIM WAS AFTER THE AMERICAN DREAM
POD1000000005_S0000092	IN SOUTH KOREA MR CHANG RAN A COFFEE AND JUICE DELIVERY BUSINESS
POD1000000005_S0000093	MRS CHANG WAS A HAIRDRESSER WHEN THEY MOVED TO L A THEY TOOK A SERIES OF MENIAL JOBS TO MAKE ENDS MEET
POD1000000005_S0000094	MR CHEN HAS TALKED ABOUT HOW HE WORKED AS A GAS STATION ATTENDANT
POD1000000005_S0000095	HE DID JANITORIAL WORK
POD1000000005_S0000096	THAT'S SUN MAHESHWARI SHE'S A BUSINESS REPORTER AT THE NEW YORK TIMES
POD1000000005_S0000097	THE LEGEND HAS IT THAT HE WAS WORKING AT A GAS STATION AND AS HE SAW PEOPLE WITH THESE REALLY NICE CARS HE WOULD ALWAYS ASK THEM WHAT THEY DID
POD1000000005_S0000098	AND HE NOTICED THE PEOPLE WITH THE NICEST CARS WORKED IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY
POD1000000005_S0000099	OK NOW I WOULD THINK THAT THE PEOPLE WITH THE NICEST CARS IN LA WERE LIKE JACK NICHOLSON AND MEL GIBSON BUT WHAT DO I KNOW
POD1000000005_S0000100	FOR SOME REASON THE GARMENT TRADE JUST BECAME FIXED IN MR CHIANG'S MIND SO HE AND HIS WIFE WENT FOR IT
POD1000000005_S0000101	THE TWO OF THEM PUT TOGETHER THEIR SAVINGS AND THEY DECIDED TO OPEN A STORE THAT WAS FIRST CALLED FASHION TWENTY ONE
POD1000000005_S0000102	AND THEY FIGURED OUT WITH THE GARMENT MANUFACTURING IN LOS ANGELES HOW TO DELIVER FASHIONS THAT PEOPLE WANTED AND TO COME UP WITH A WAY OF SELLING CLOTHES THAT CHURNED THROUGH STYLES MADE AN EXCITING ENVIRONMENT
POD1000000005_S0000103	AND REALLY CREATED THE TYPE OF PLACE WHERE YOU HAD TO COME IN TO SEE WHAT WAS NEW
POD1000000005_S0000104	NOW THIS MIGHT NOT SEEM VERY REVOLUTIONARY
POD1000000005_S0000105	ESPECIALLY TODAY WHEN CONSUMERS CAN GET KNOCK OFFS OF THE LATEST LUXURY FASHION SEEMINGLY BEFORE THE MODELS HAVE STRUTTED OFF THE CATWALK
POD1000000005_S0000106	BUT IN THE EIGHTY S THAT WASN'T REALLY HOW FASHION WAS DONE
POD1000000005_S0000107	THEY HIT ON SOMETHING AS HAPPENS IN RETAIL THEY HIT UPON A FORMULA THAT RESONATED WITH SHOPPERS AND THEY QUICKLY BECAME A SUCCESS
POD1000000005_S0000108	IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR THE CHANGES OPENED FASHION TWENTY ONE A NINE HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT BOUTIQUE IN THE HEART OF THE HIGHLAND PARK NEIGHBORHOOD
POD1000000005_S0000109	THEY PACKED IT WITH CHEAP SKIMPY TEAM CLOTHES THAT THEY BOUGHT FROM A KOREAN AMERICAN GARMENT MANUFACTURERS LIKE THE KIND MR KIM SOLD
POD1000000005_S0000110	I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DEFINITELY HELPED THEM WAS THE FACT THAT THEY WERE IN LOS ANGELES AND TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE OTHER KOREAN AMERICAN GARMENT MANUFACTURERS IN THAT CITY SPECIFICALLY
POD1000000005_S0000111	SO I THINK THAT VERY MUCH WAS A PROPELLER OF THEIR SUCCESS
POD1000000005_S0000112	REMEMBER THE JOBBER MARKET
POD1000000005_S0000113	JAVA JAVA MARK
POD1000000005_S0000114	KIM EXPLAINS THAT THE JOB MARKET CAME ABOUT AROUND THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO WITH THE ARRIVAL OF KOREAN IMMIGRANTS FROM SOUTH AMERICA
POD1000000005_S0000115	HE CAME FROM BOLIVIA MANY OF THE OTHER FOLKS HAD WORKED IN BRAZIL IN THAT COUNTRY'S MASSIVE GARMENT INDUSTRY AND THEY ALL BOUGHT THAT EXPERIENCE WITH THEM TO LA
POD1000000005_S0000116	THEY BOUGHT WHOLESALE CLOTHES OUT GARMENTS AND WENT TO WORK OPENING THEIR OWN STORES
POD1000000005_S0000117	PEOPLE STARTED TO SELL MERCHANDISE
POD1000000005_S0000118	BUT THE PEOPLE COME FROM THE BRAZIL THEY STARTED MAKING MANUFACTURING THEIR OWN BRAND OPERA
POD1000000005_S0000119	BY THE TIME THE CHANGES GOT TO LA THE KOREAN AMERICAN APPAREL INDUSTRY WAS ALREADY IN FULL SWING
POD1000000005_S0000120	THE COUPLE WORKED WITH MANUFACTURERS IN THE JOB MARKET TO FILL UP FASHION TWENTY ONE WITH INEXPENSIVE STYLES THAT COULD BE TURNED OVER QUICKLY
POD1000000005_S0000122	MY PRODUCER WHITNEY AND I DECIDED TO SEE WHERE IT ALL BEGAN
POD1000000005_S0000123	SO WE TOOK A TRIP TO FIFTY SIX THIRTY SEVEN NORTH FIGAROA STREET AND CRUISED AROUND THE SHOP FOR A BIT
POD1000000005_S0000125	THE SIGN ON THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING STILL READS FASHION TWENTY ONE AN HOMAGE TO ITS HUMBLE ROOTS
POD1000000005_S0000126	BUT IT'S A FOREVER TWENTY ONE STORE THROUGH AND THROUGH
POD1000000005_S0000127	STYLES FROM ONE DOLLAR BODY
POD1000000005_S0000129	BODYSUIT THERE FOR EIGHT BUCKS IF YOU WANT
POD1000000005_S0000130	I'VE GOT ALL THE BODYSUIT I NEED RIGHT NOW
POD1000000005_S0000131	WELL THAT'S DEBATABLE
POD1000000005_S0000132	WE POP INSIDE AND IT LOOKS PRETTY CLASSY
POD1000000005_S0000133	LIKE MAYBE IT'S MORE FOR ADULTS THAN TEENS
POD1000000005_S0000134	WE HEAD TO A RACK OF GRAPHICS AND I'M KIND OF INTO THEM
POD1000000005_S0000135	I MEAN I WOULD ONE HUNDRED PERCENT WEAR THAT
POD1000000005_S0000137	
POD1000000005_S0000138	IF THEY HAVE LIKE A LARGE I WOULD TOTALLY WEAR THAT
POD1000000005_S0000139	CAN'T STOP STOP
POD1000000005_S0000140	WELL THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT YOU CAN'T STOP ONE STEP
POD1000000005_S0000141	ALAS WE LEFT EMPTY HANDED NO EIGHT DOLLARS BODYSUITS FOR WHITNEY
POD1000000005_S0000143	IF THE FASHION TWENTY ONE STORE ON FIGAROA WAS REPRESENTATIVE OF WHAT THE CHANG'S BUSINESS WAS IN THE EARLY DAYS IT SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A NICE LITTLE LIFE FOR THEM
POD1000000005_S0000144	IN ITS FIRST YEAR THE STORE PULLED IN SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
POD1000000005_S0000145	AND THAT WAS LARGELY THANKS TO OTHER KOREAN IMMIGRANTS
POD1000000005_S0000146	BUT THEN THEY REALIZED HOW SUCCESSFUL THIS BUSINESS MODEL WAS
POD1000000005_S0000147	AND THEY STARTED OPENING NEW STORES
POD1000000005_S0000148	THAT'S LUDOVICA CESARIO SHE'S A MARKETING PROFESSOR AT LEHIGH UNIVERSITY
POD1000000005_S0000149	THEY THEN CHANGE THE NAME TO FOREVER TWENTY ONE WITH THE IDEA THAT THEY'RE SELLING CLOTHES FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO BE TRENDY OR FRESH OR JUST YOUNG MORE GENERALLY
POD1000000005_S0000150	THIS BUSINESS MODEL SELLING CHEAP TRENDY CLOTHES THAT COULD BE MANUFACTURED QUICKLY AND TURNED OVER FREQUENTLY SO THE STORES ALWAYS FELT NEW AND FRESH THAT WAS THE CHIANG'S SECRET WEAPON
POD1000000005_S0000151	TODAY WE CALL THIS APPROACH FAST FASHION AND LOTS OF GLOBAL BRANDS DO IT AND ZARAH AND SO TO NAME A FEW
POD1000000005_S0000152	BUT FOREVER TWENTY ONE PERFECTED IT
POD1000000005_S0000153	FOR A DEFINITION OF FAST FASHION HERE'S THE WASHINGTON POST FASHION CRITIC I'M SORRY THE PULITZER PRIZE WINNING FASHION CRITIC ROBIN GIVAN
POD1000000005_S0000154	I MEAN IT'S GENERALLY CLOTHING THAT IS PRODUCED VERY QUICKLY VERY MUCH LEAPING INTO A TREND OF THE MOMENT AND NOT MEANT TO LAST
POD1000000005_S0000155	MEANING THE DESIGN IS NOT MENTAL OR THE CLOTHING IS NOT MENTALLY
POD1000000005_S0000156	BOTH THE IDEA IS THAT IF YOU WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN A TREND IN A FAD AND ONE THAT IS MOST LIKELY A FLEETING FAD FAST FASHION ALLOWS YOU TO GLOM ONTO THAT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
POD1000000005_S0000157	IT ALLOWS YOU TO GRASP IT FOR MINIMAL COST
POD1000000005_S0000158	WEAR IT A FEW TIMES
POD1000000005_S0000159	SAVOR THE MOMENT LITERALLY THE MOMENT AND THEN MOVE ON
POD1000000005_S0000160	AND FAST FASHION TRADES IN FOMO SAYS CESARIO
POD1000000005_S0000161	THERE'S THIS ALMOST FEAR OF MISSING OUT THAT IF YOU DON'T GO TO THE STORE AS SOON AS THE SHIPMENT ARRIVES YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO FIND THAT PRODUCT IN YOUR SIZE
POD1000000005_S0000162	AND SO IT CREATES THIS SENSE OF URGENCY BASICALLY IN CONSUMERS TO WANT TO MAKE THEM KEEP COMING BACK TO THE STORE
POD1000000005_S0000163	THAT AND INSANELY CHEAP PRICES
POD1000000005_S0000164	LIKE CLOTHES FOR UNDER TEN DOLLARS APIECE
POD1000000005_S0000165	THIS BUSINESS MODEL PLUS A MANAGEABLE NUMBER OF STORES MEANT THAT THE CHANGES OPERATION WAS PROFITABLE AND EVERYTHING WAS PRETTY DECENT
POD1000000005_S0000166	BUT THE CHANGES WEREN'T INTERESTED IN PRETTY DECENT
POD1000000005_S0000167	THEY WERE CHASING THEIR BIG BOLD AMERICAN DREAM
POD1000000005_S0000168	I THINK THAT MR CHENG AT LEAST IN THIS PERIOD WHERE HE STARTED EXPANDING INTO DEPARTMENT STORES
POD1000000005_S0000169	ALSO THOUGHT THAT FOREVER TWENTY ONE COULD BE MORE THAN WHERE COLLEGE GIRLS GOT A NEW OUTFIT FOR SATURDAY NIGHT
POD1000000005_S0000170	HE THOUGHT THAT MAYBE THEY COULD BE A PLACE WHERE THE WHOLE FAMILY COULD BE OUTFITTED
POD1000000005_S0000171	WHERE YOU WOULD REALLY TRUST THIS STORE TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A LOT OF THE CLOTHING FOR YOUR EVERYDAY LIFE
POD1000000005_S0000173	TWELVE MILES FROM THE FIRST FOREVER TWENTY ONE PROPERTY IS THE BEVERLY CENTER A SPRAWLING SHOPPING MALL THAT ONE ANGELINO TOLD ME IS QUOTE ONE OF THE MOST HATED MALLS IN L A
POD1000000005_S0000174	IT'S MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND SQUARE FEET OF PRADA FENDI AND BALENCIAGA
POD1000000005_S0000175	TUCKED INTO A CORNER ON LEVEL EIGHT IS FOREVER WHICH I GUESS IS FOREVER TWENTY ONE BUT MAKE IT LUXURY
POD1000000005_S0000176	THE STORE OCCUPIES MORE THAN AN ACRE OF REAL ESTATE AND IS NOT MEANT FOR PEOPLE OVER A CERTAIN AGE
POD1000000005_S0000177	IT'S BRIGHT AND LOUD AND THE SEEMINGLY NEVER ENDING SELECTION OF CLOTHES IS DISORIENTED
POD1000000005_S0000178	HONESTLY I FELT LIKE I NEEDED A SANE AND A NAP AFTER WE VISITED
POD1000000005_S0000179	BUT THIS WAS WHAT THE CHANGES WERE AFTER THEY WERE PLANTING THEIR FLAG WITH HUGE SORES IN FANCY MALLS
POD1000000005_S0000180	THIS WAS THEIR AMERICAN DREAM REALIZED
POD1000000005_S0000181	AND THEY BUILT IT LARGELY ON TOP OF THE ASHES OF FALLEN RETAILERS
POD1000000005_S0000182	IT WAS REALLY IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS THAT YOU SAW THEM SORT OF BURST ONTO THE NATIONAL SCENE AND THAT REALLY EMERGED WITH THE ACQUISITION OF STORES OWNED BY GATZKE
POD1000000005_S0000183	DO YOU REMEMBER THAT RETAILER
POD1000000005_S0000184	GATZKE WAS A CLOTHING COMPANY WITH HUNDREDS OF STORES AND MALLS ACROSS THE US
POD1000000005_S0000185	IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR IT FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY
POD1000000005_S0000186	AND SO THERE'S ALL THESE STORES AND OTHER ASSETS THAT WERE UP FOR PURCHASE AND FOREVER TWENTY ONE BIT ON THOSE SUCCESSFULLY
POD1000000005_S0000187	AND WITH THAT THEY REALLY EXPANDED THEIR STORE BASE AND ALSO BECAME A NATIONAL PLAYER IN A WHOLE NEW WAY
POD1000000005_S0000188	IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE FOREVER TWENTY ONE BEGAN A PERIOD OF MIND BLOWING EXPANSION
POD1000000005_S0000189	WHEN MALL CHAINS LIKE MARVINS AND CARS AND OTHERS WERE TOPPLING UNDER THEIR OWN WEIGHT FOREVER TWENTY ONE WAS SNATCHING UP THEIR SCRAPS
POD1000000005_S0000190	WHEN THE GLOBAL RECESSION HIT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT CANS LOOKED AT IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PUSH EVEN HARDER
POD1000000005_S0000191	NOTHING LIKE HITTING THE GAS WHEN YOUR COMPETITORS ARE SLAMMING INTO THE GUARD RAILS
POD1000000005_S0000192	BY TWENTY ELEVEN FOREVER TWENTY ONE HAD ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED STORES AROUND THE COUNTRY AND EMPLOYED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE
POD1000000005_S0000193	WITHIN JUST A FEW YEARS AFTER THAT THE COMPANY HAD EXPANDED TO FORTY SEVEN COUNTRIES
POD1000000005_S0000194	SO THAT MEANT THAT TWEENS IN THE PHILIPPINES OR ROMANIA OR MACAU COULD ALL ROCK A BOXY SHIRT FLOUNCE CUFF TOP OR LEPARD DRAWSTRING LOUNGE SHORT FOR LESS THAN THE PRICE OF A MOVIE TICKET
POD1000000005_S0000195	TWENTY FIFTEEN WAS FOREVER TWENTY ONE'S PEAK
POD1000000005_S0000196	IT DID FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN SALES THAT YEAR
POD1000000005_S0000197	WHICH MEANS THAT THEY SOLD A HELL OF A LOT OF TEN DOLLARS MINI DRESSES AND BRAMLETTE AND WHATEVER DOLPHIN SHORTS ARE
POD1000000005_S0000198	BUT EVEN THOUGH FOREVER TWENTY ONE HAD GROWN INTO A MULTIBILLION DOLLAR BUSINESS THE CHANGES RAN IT LIKE A MOM AND POP OPERATION
POD1000000005_S0000199	THEY OWNED NINETY NINE PERCENT OF THE COMPANY AND HAD NEVER TAKEN ON INVESTORS WHICH MEANT THAT THERE WAS AND I CAN'T STRESS THIS ENOUGH NO REAL BOARD OF DIRECTORS THEY HAD TO RUN DECISIONS BY
POD1000000005_S0000200	OR AT LEAST NOT IN THE TRADITIONAL SENSE
POD1000000005_S0000201	THE BOARD CONSISTED OF MR CHANG ONE OF HIS DAUGHTERS AND ANOTHER FOREVER TWENTY ONE EXECUTIVE
POD1000000005_S0000202	THEY FELT THAT THEY WERE BUILDING SOMETHING OF AN EMPIRE THEY WERE IN CHARGE MR AND MRS CHANG WERE IN CHARGE AND THEY WERE GOING TO PASS THIS BUSINESS ON TO THEIR DAUGHTERS
POD1000000005_S0000203	AND IT WAS ONLY GOING TO GROW AND BECOME BIGGER
POD1000000005_S0000204	THE FACT THAT THEY OWNED EVERYTHING ALSO MEANT THAT THERE'S NOT MUCH PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY
POD1000000005_S0000205	AND THE FAMILY'S NOT REAL INTO TALKING TO THE PRESS
POD1000000005_S0000206	THE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT WOULDN'T TALK TO US FOR THIS STORY THOUGH WE DID REACH OUT
POD1000000005_S0000207	WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT MR CHANG OVERSAW BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND STRATEGY WHILE MRS CHANG RAN THE MERCHANDISING SIDE OF THINGS ONE FLOOR BELOW THEIR ADULT DAUGHTERS LINDA AND ESTHER SERVED AS THEIR DEPUTIES
POD1000000005_S0000208	THEY KIND OF OVERSAW THEIR OWN FIEFDOMS WITHIN THE FOREVER TWENTY ONE BUSINESS
POD1000000005_S0000209	MR CHANG HAD TO REVIEW EVERY SINGLE REAL ESTATE CONTRACT AND WAS INVOLVED WITH THE OPENING OF EVERY NEW STORE WHICH AT THE PACE THAT THEY WERE EXPANDING IS IS A HUGE RESPONSIBILITY
POD1000000005_S0000210	MRS CHANG HAD HER OWN HANDS FULL
POD1000000005_S0000211	OVERSEEING THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF STYLES AND GARMENTS AND APPROVING EACH OF THOSE INDIVIDUALLY BEFORE THEY APPEARED IN STORES
POD1000000005_S0000212	I MEAN IN MANY WAYS IT'S FLABBERGASTING THAT THESE TWO PEOPLE COULD HAVE TAKEN ON THIS AMOUNT OF RESPONSIBILITY ESPECIALLY AT A COMPANY OF THIS SIZE
POD1000000005_S0000213	ONE MINUTE THEY'D BE OVERSEEING NEW REAL ESTATE PURCHASES OR CLOTHING DESIGNS AND THE NEXT MINUTE THEY'D BE APPROVING EXPENSES FOR BUSINESS LUNCHES OR UBERS
POD1000000005_S0000214	WHICH SEEMS LIKE THE VERY DEFINITION OF MICROMANAGING
POD1000000005_S0000215	NO BILLIONAIRE CEOS ARE APPROVING TIME SHEETS OR EVEN WHAT BUTTONS OR ZIPPERS SHOULD BE USED ON NEW DESIGNS
POD1000000005_S0000216	KEVIN FEAGANS WAS FOREVER TWENTY ONE'S GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR DURING THE TIME OF THE BRAND'S RAPID INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION
POD1000000005_S0000217	HE SAYS WHILE HAVING YOUR HAND IN EVERY POT MIGHT NOT BE THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO RUN A BUSINESS IT DID MEAN THAT THE CHANGES KNEW WHAT THEIR BRAND WAS ALL ABOUT
POD1000000005_S0000218	WELL I THINK THE ONE THING THEY UNDERSTOOD WAS YOU KNOW BRAND PERSONALITY
POD1000000005_S0000219	THEY KNEW THEIR CUSTOMER INCREDIBLY WELL SO
POD1000000005_S0000220	YOU KNOW KNOWING AND AT LEAST I SAY THAT DOMESTICALLY I MEAN IN THE US THEY KNEW WHO SHE WAS
POD1000000005_S0000221	THEY KNEW WHAT SHE LIKED
POD1000000005_S0000222	THEY KNEW YOU KNOW WHEN SHE WANTED THINGS
POD1000000005_S0000223	IT'S LIKE BACK TO SCHOOL IT'S CHRISTMAS
POD1000000005_S0000224	IT'S IT'S YOU KNOW HOLIDAY IT'S YOU KNOW FESTIVAL SEASON WHICH IS HUGE OBVIOUSLY
POD1000000005_S0000225	WHILE IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND PRODUCT AND WHO'S BUYING IT IT'S EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE MARKET YOU'RE OPERATING
POD1000000005_S0000226	I THINK THE CHALLENGE WITH RUNNING AND OPERATING A GLOBAL BUSINESS IS THAT YOU KNOW SEASONALITY CHANGED
POD1000000005_S0000227	CULTURAL MINDSETS CHANGE
POD1000000005_S0000228	SO YOU KNOW WHAT THE FRENCH CUSTOMER WANTS THE GERMAN CUSTOMER DOESN'T
POD1000000005_S0000229	YOU KNOW WHAT SOMEONE IN AUSTRALIA IS WAITING WELL FIRST OF ALL THEY'RE COUNTER SEASONAL

POD1000000005_S0000231	IN FOREVER TWENTY ONE RACE TO GLOBAL DOMINATION THEY SPREAD THEMSELVES TOO THIN
POD1000000005_S0000232	WITH NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED STORES WORLDWIDE THEY COULDN'T REALLY MANAGE ALL THOSE PHYSICAL SPACES

POD1000000005_S0000277	IN ORDER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW ONE OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST FAST FASHION BRANDS FELL APART I DECIDED TO GO TO THE SOURCE A TEEN GIRL
POD1000000005_S0000278	DAN GOLDBLUM IS A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD HIGH SCHOOL JUNIOR WHO LIVES JUST OUTSIDE OF WASHINGTON D C
POD1000000005_S0000279	SHE USED TO SHOP IT FOREVER TWENTY ONE A LOT SHE SAID UNTIL THEY QUOTE STOPPED BEING
POD1000000005_S0000280	THEY'RE CHEAP THEY'RE NOT IN GOOD SHAPE THEY BREAK FAST AND SOME OF THEM ARE REALLY TACKY
POD1000000005_S0000281	WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO MONTGOMERY MALL RIGHT OUTSIDE OF D C

POD1000000005_S0000285	IT'S REAL DISAPPOINTMENT
POD1000000005_S0000286	BEFORE I GO INTO THE THIRD FOREVER TWENTY ONE OF THIS STORY I ISSUED A CHALLENGE
POD1000000005_S0000287	EACH OF US HAD TO FIND ONE CUTE THING TO BUY
POD1000000005_S0000288	BUT AFTER MANY MINUTES OF BROWSING THE ENORMOUS STORE
POD1000000005_S0000289	I DON'T THINK I CAN DO THE CHALLENGE
POD1000000005_S0000290	I DON'T THINK I CAN DO THE CHALLENGE EITHER
POD1000000005_S0000291	BECAUSE IT'S OVERWHELMING ACTUAL
POD1000000005_S0000292	THING HERE
POD1000000005_S0000293	NOW IT MAKES SENSE THAT I COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING CUTE FOR ME
POD1000000005_S0000294	I MEAN THE STORE ISN'T CALLED FOREVER FORTY ONE
POD1000000005_S0000295	BUT IT SHOULD TROUBLE THE COMPANY THAT A MEMBER OF ITS TARGET DEMOGRAPHIC CAN'T FIND ANYTHING SHE LIKES IN A STORE THE SIZE OF A MCMANSION
POD1000000005_S0000296	OKAY SO BASIC
POD1000000005_S0000298	LIKE IT'S LIKE A NORMAL MATERIAL
POD1000000005_S0000299	
POD1000000005_S0000300	FINALLY AFTER SOME SERIOUS HUNTING DAN LANDED ON THE ONE THING IN THE ENTIRE STORE SHE WOULD WEAR
POD1000000005_S0000301	ALL RIGHT
POD1000000005_S0000302	CAN HOLD ON TO THAT
POD1000000005_S0000303	ALL RIGHT
POD1000000005_S0000304	THEN IT WAS UP TO ME TO FIND SOMETHING I LIKED
POD1000000005_S0000305	I TRIED ON A CROP WINDBREAKER AND THAT WENT ABOUT AS WELL AS COULD BE EXPECTED
POD1000000005_S0000306	IT'S VERY SNUG AROUND HERE LIKE IS IT SUPPOSED TO FIT LIKE THIS
POD1000000005_S0000308	GUYS I'M JUST GONNA GO OUT FOR A JOG AND THEN I'M GONNA GO TO THE AND THEN I'M GONNA GO TO THE CLUB AFTERWARDS
POD1000000005_S0000309	FINALLY I LANDED ON MY ITEM A PLAIN BLACK BASEBALL CAP WITH THE WORDS DANGEROUS BUT FUN WRITTEN ON THE CROWN
POD1000000005_S0000310	DANGEROUS BUT
POD1000000005_S0000311	DANGEROUS BUT FUN
POD1000000005_S0000312	THINK YOU SHOULD GET
POD1000000005_S0000313	YOU THINK I SHOULD
POD1000000005_S0000314	I THINK YOU SHOULD
POD1000000005_S0000315	
POD1000000005_S0000316	NOW I CAN TELL YOU THAT I LOOKED NEITHER DANGEROUS NOR FUN
POD1000000005_S0000317	BUT I BOUGHT THE HAT AND EDEN BOUGHT THE LITTLE SKIRT AND WE BOTH FULFILLED OUR FOREVER TWENTY ONE CHALLENGE
POD1000000005_S0000318	GREAT JOB
POD1000000005_S0000319	ARE WE DONE
POD1000000005_S0000320	ARE WE DONE
POD1000000005_S0000321	DO YOU FEEL LIKE WE'RE DONE
POD1000000005_S0000322	I FEEL LIKE WE'RE DONE
POD1000000005_S0000323	WE WERE DONE THOUGH
POD1000000005_S0000324	I LEFT FOREVER TWENTY ONE FIFTEEN DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS LIGHTER AND PERHAPS MORE CONFUSED THAN I HAD BEEN BEFORE ABOUT HOW THE BRAND'S BUSINESS MODEL COULD POSSIBLY MAKE SENSE
POD1000000005_S0000325	THERE WERE HARDLY ANY SHOPPERS IN ANY OF THE STORES I WENT TO AND THOSE WHO WERE THERE SEEMED MORE LIKE OLD MILLENNIALS THAN GENZ TASTEMAKERS
POD1000000005_S0000326	I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT THIS GIANT STORE WAS ALL ABOUT
POD1000000005_S0000327	OR HOW FAST FASHION IS EVEN SUPPOSED TO WORK
POD1000000005_S0000328	I FIGURED ROBIN GIVAN COULD HELP
POD1000000005_S0000329	IN ADDITION TO REPORTING ON THE RUNWAYS OF PARIS AND NEW YORK GIVAN OFTEN WRITES ABOUT WHAT FASHION SAYS ABOUT HOW WE LIVE NOW
POD1000000005_S0000330	AND SHE THINKS A LOT ABOUT FAST FASHION AND ITS IMPACT ON OUR CULTURE ESTHETICALLY SOCIALLY AND ENVIRONMENTALLY
POD1000000005_S0000331	SURPRISINGLY SHE ISN'T TOTALLY DOWN ON FAST FASHION
POD1000000005_S0000332	I DO THINK THAT FAST FASHION HAS KIND OF ALLOWED EVERYONE TO HAVE ACCESS TO AESTHETICALLY THOUGHTFUL CLOTHING
POD1000000005_S0000333	DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE ALL DRESSING BETTER THOUGH
POD1000000005_S0000334	NOTICE I SAID TO HAVE ACCESS TO
POD1000000005_S0000336	IN A WAY GIVAN SAYS FAST FASHION IS KIND OF BRILLIANT WHEN IT'S DONE RIGHT
POD1000000005_S0000337	FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE THEY'RE NOT GOING INTO THE DESIGNER BOUTIQUE
POD1000000005_S0000338	THEY'RE GOING INTO A DEPARTMENT STORE OR A MASS MERCHANT
POD1000000005_S0000339	AND YOU KNOW THOSE STORES LOOK AT TREND REPORTS AND THEY LOOK AT WHAT'S ON THE RUNWAY AND PART OF THEIR GREAT SKILL IN BOTH MARKETING AND MANUFACTURING IS BEING ABLE TO TAKE THOSE IDEAS AND TURN THEM AROUND AT JUST A RAPID FIRE PACE AND GET THEM INTO STORES
POD1000000005_S0000340	AND THERE ISN'T JUST ONE DELIVERY THAT HAPPENS AT THE BEGINNING OF A SEASON NO NO
POD1000000005_S0000341	IT'S A CONSTANT STREAM OF NEWNESS
POD1000000005_S0000342	AND WHEN I SAY CONSTANT I MEAN LIKE EVERY TWO WEEKS FOR SOME OF THESE PLACES
POD1000000005_S0000343	SO GIVAN SAYS THAT AT ITS BEST FAST FASHION MEANS THAT NEW STYLISH CLOTHES AREN'T JUST FOR FANCIES WITH CASH TO SHOP OCCUR
POD1000000005_S0000344	BUT I'M GOING TO LET YOU IN ON A LITTLE SECRET
POD1000000005_S0000345	IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR CLOTHING DESIGNERS TO GO FROM ORIGINAL IDEA TO BRAND SPANKING NEW PRODUCT ON THE RACK IN TWO WEEKS
POD1000000005_S0000346	ESPECIALLY NOT AT THE VOLUME THAT FOREVER TWENTY ONE NEEDED TO FILL ALL OF THEIR BRAZILIAN STORES
POD1000000005_S0000347	SO THE COMPANY HAD TO FIND SOME SHORTCUTS
POD1000000005_S0000348	COPYING OTHER DESIGNERS IDEAS WAS PART OF FOREVER TWENTY ONE'S BUSINESS MODEL FROM THE BEGINNING
POD1000000005_S0000349	SUSAN SCAFIDI IS THE FOUNDER OF THE FASHION LAW INSTITUTE AT FORDHAM UNIVERSITY AND SHE BASICALLY INVENTED THE FIELD OF FASHION LAW
POD1000000005_S0000350	AND SHE'LL BE THE FIRST ONE TO TELL YOU THAT WHILE FOREVER TWENTY ONE PRACTICE OF COPYING OTHER DESIGNERS IDEAS IS ACUTE LOOK IT'S GENERALLY TOTALLY LEGAL
POD1000000005_S0000351	FASHION IS NOT RECOGNIZED AS AN ART FORM IN THE UNITED STATES
POD1000000005_S0000352	SO IT DOESN'T GET COPYRIGHT PROTECTION IN LARGE PART BECAUSE A HUNDRED YEARS AGO THE COPYRIGHT OFFICE DECIDED THAT FASHION NO MATTER HOW FANCIFUL WAS UTILITARIAN
POD1000000005_S0000353	ONLY A COUPLE AREAS OF FASHION ARE PROTECTED FROM COPYING
POD1000000005_S0000354	WE HAVE A TINY BIT OF COPYRIGHT PROTECTION AT LEAST SINCE THE NINETEEN SIXTY S FOR TWO DIMENSIONAL ELEMENTS OF FASHION THINGS LIKE FABRIC PRINTS OR LACE DESIGNS
POD1000000005_S0000355	OVER ON THE PATENT SIDE WE'VE HAD HISTORICALLY A LITTLE BIT OF PROTECTION FOR SOME FUNCTIONAL ELEMENTS OF FASHION THINGS LIKE ZIPPERS AND VELCRO AND KEVLAR AND SPACE SUITS OR HAZMAT SUITS
POD1000000005_S0000356	AND THEN AT THE END OF THE DAY WHAT FASHION REALLY HAS TO RELY ON IS TRADEMARK PROTECTION
POD1000000005_S0000357	HIS PROTECTION FOR THE LOGO OR LABEL
POD1000000005_S0000358	SO BASICALLY THE POLO PONY ON YOUR CHEST OR THE GIANT DOUBLE ON YOUR BELT BUCKLE THOSE ARE PROTECTED
POD1000000005_S0000359	THE DESIGN OF THE SHIRT AND BELT THEMSELVES ARE NOT ORIGINAL PRINTS ARE GENERALLY ALSO PROTECTED
POD1000000005_S0000360	WHILE THERE AREN'T A TON OF COPYRIGHT AND TRADEMARK PROTECTIONS FOR FASHION IN THE U S
POD1000000005_S0000361	FOREVER TWENTY ONE HAS STILL FOUND ITSELF INVOLVED IN MANY MANY MANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWSUITS SCAFIDI SAYS THEY'RE ONE OF THE MOST EGREGIOUS OFFENDERS IN THE GAME
POD1000000005_S0000362	THE PUMA ADITES ANNA SEE DIANE VON FURSTENBERG AND GWEN STEFANI HAVE ALL PURSUED LEGAL ACTION AGAINST FOREVER TWENTY ONE ALLEGING VARIOUS FORMS OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT
POD1000000005_S0000363	MANY SMALLER BRANDS HAVE ALSO CLAIMED THEIR PRINTS OR DESIGNS WERE RIPPED OFF BY THE MEGA RETAILER
POD1000000005_S0000364	BUT MOST DIDN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO GO AGAINST A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR MAMMOTH
POD1000000005_S0000365	AND SCAFIDI SAYS FAST FASHION BRANDS LIKE FOREVER TWENTY ONE BANK ON THAT
POD1000000005_S0000366	A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF COPYING IS IS BAKED INTO THE BUSINESS MODEL OF EVERY FAST FASHION COMPANY
POD1000000005_S0000367	THE ONLY QUESTION IS HOW LITERALLY THEY'RE COPYING AND HOW MUCH THEY'RE CHANGING IT UP
POD1000000005_S0000368	IN FOREVER TWENTY ONE CASE THEY'D OFTEN BARELY BOTHER TO CHANGE ANYTHING ABOUT THE ORIGINAL DESIGN THEY WERE RIPPING OFF
POD1000000005_S0000369	AND SOME OF THEIR FABRIC PRINTS WERE JUST A STRAIGHT CUT AND COPY JOB
POD1000000005_S0000370	AND MAYBE ON THE BACKEND YOU GET CAUGHT AND HAVE TO PAY OUT THE OCCASIONAL SETTLEMENT OR OR PAY SOME LEGAL FEES
POD1000000005_S0000371	BUT USUALLY THAT'S CHEAPER THAN ACTUALLY HIRING DESIGNERS AND ENGAGING IN INNOVATIVE PRODUCT RESEARCH
POD1000000005_S0000372	COPYING CLOTHING DESIGN HASN'T BEEN FOREVER TWENTY ONE'S ONLY QUESTIONABLE MOVE
POD1000000005_S0000373	IN TWO THOUSAND ONE WORKERS ADVOCACY CENTER FILED A LAWSUIT ON BEHALF OF EMPLOYEES WHO SAID THEY WERE MADE TO WORK INSANE HOURS FOR WAY LESS THAN MINIMUM WAGE
POD1000000005_S0000374	IN TWENTY TWELVE THE U S DEPARTMENT OF LABOR SUED THE RETAILER FOR FAILING TO PAY FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE TO ITS MANUFACTURERS AND CONTRACTORS
POD1000000005_S0000375	AND IN TWENTY NINETEEN POP STAR ARIANA GRANDE SLAPPED FOREVER TWENTY ONE WITH A TEN MILLION DOLLAR LAWSUIT
POD1000000005_S0000376	THE COMPANY USED A MODEL IN THIS AD CAMPAIGN THAT LOOKS AN AWFUL LOT LIKE ARIANA GRANDE
POD1000000005_S0000377	SHE CLAIMS THEY DID THIS TO CONFUSE CONSUMERS THAT SHE HAD ENDORSED THEM
POD1000000005_S0000378	AND THAT ARIANA GRANDE LOOKED LIKE WAS ME JUST KIDDING
POD1000000005_S0000379	A BEHEMOTH LIKE FOREVER TWENTY ONE RARELY FAILS BECAUSE OF ONE MISSTEP
POD1000000005_S0000380	HOW DID IT FALTER LET US COUNT THE WAYS
POD1000000005_S0000381	HOW ABOUT ROUTINE LEGAL TROUBLES LEASING TOO MUCH EXPENSIVE RETAIL SPACE SCREW MERCHANDISING THAT GUMMED UP THEIR SUPPLY CHAIN AND NO TRADITIONAL BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO PUMP THE BRAKES
POD1000000005_S0000382	AND WITH RETAIL MOVING MORE AND MORE ONLINE FOREVER TWENTY ONE'S WEAK ECOMMERCE GAME DIDN'T HELP MATTERS
POD1000000005_S0000383	IN RECENT YEARS THERE'S BEEN ONE OTHER MAJOR ISSUE TUGGING AT FOREVER TWENTY ONE FELONY HIM SUSTAINABILITY BECAUSE SUSTAINABLE IT AIN'T
POD1000000005_S0000384	I WONDER IS FAST FASHION IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY LIKE IS THAT JUST AS BAD AS IT CAN GET
POD1000000005_S0000385	WELL I'M I'M HESITANT TO SAY THE WORST BUT I WOULD BE HARD PRESSED TO THINK OF ANOTHER REALM OF THE FASHION INDUSTRY THAT IS AS BAD
POD1000000005_S0000386	BECAUSE FAST FASHION HAS AS ITS FUNDAMENTAL PURPOSE
POD1000000005_S0000387	QUICK DISPOSABILITY
POD1000000005_S0000388	YOU KNOW THE TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS HANDBAG THAT IS A KNOCKOFF OF SOME YOU KNOW ITEM THAT CAME DOWN THE RUNWAY
POD1000000005_S0000389	THAT IS REALLY MEANT TO BE USED FOR A FEW MONTHS AND THEN YOU KNOW CHUCKED INTO THE TRASH WILL THAT'S GOING TO END UP IN A LANDFILL
POD1000000005_S0000390	AS OPPOSED TO SAY AN ARMED HANDBAG THAT IS THE PRICE OF A SMALL CAR
POD1000000005_S0000391	THAT'S NOT GETTING TOSSED OUT
POD1000000005_S0000392	THAT'S GOING IN THE SAFE DEPOSIT BOX AS INSURANCE FOR THE APOCALYPSE
POD1000000005_S0000393	SUSTAINABILITY IN FASHION ISN'T JUST ABOUT BUYING MORE DURABLE CLASSIC HANDBAGS
POD1000000005_S0000394	THE RISE OF ONLINE CONSIGNMENT SHOPPING AS WELL AS CLOTHING RENTAL STARTUPS LIKE RENT THE RUNWAY MEANS CONSUMERS ARE INCREASINGLY TRYING TO BUY USED AND OWN LESS STUFF
POD1000000005_S0000395	A CLOTHING BRAND THAT BANKS ON DISPOSABILITY IS NOT LONG FOR THIS NEW WORLD
POD1000000005_S0000396	BY SEPTEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN IT HAD ALL BECOME JUST TOO MUCH FOR FOREVER TWENTY ONE
POD1000000005_S0000397	THE COMPANY BUILT BY IMMIGRANTS FROM A SINGLE STOREFRONT IN LA INTO A FOUR BILLION DOLLARS COLOSSUS FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY
POD1000000005_S0000398	IT'S THE END OF AN ERA
POD1000000005_S0000399	IF YOU'RE A FAN OF FOREVER TWENTY ONE YOU MAY HAVE TO SAY GOODBYE TO A STORE NEAR YOU
POD1000000005_S0000400	OVER THE WEEKEND THE RETAILER FILED FOR CHAPTER ELEVEN BANKRUPTCY ALL THIS IN HOPES OF SALVAGING THE COMPANY'S BRAND
POD1000000005_S0000401	NATURALLY THE INTERNET WAS A BUZZ AT THE NEWS
POD1000000005_S0000402	TONS OF YOUTUBERS RACED OUT TO FOREVER TWENTY ONE SHOPS TO GET SOME DEALS DEALS DEALS AND NATURALLY THEY MADE VIDEOS

POD1000000011_S0000073	THAT'S RIGHT IT'S TIED TO STEREOTYPES RACE AND ESPECIALLY GENDER RESEARCH SHOWS THAT MOTHERS AND PRESCHOOL TEACHERS WHO ARE OVERWHELMINGLY WOMEN THEY CAN PASS THAT FEELING ON TO THEIR KIDS ESPECIALLY TO THEIR GIRLS

POD1000000011_S0000075	CHILDREN ARE NOT BORN WITH MATH ANXIETY RIGHT IT'S PASSED ON TO THEM SO I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE TO CHECK OURSELVES
POD1000000011_S0000076	AND WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MATH
POD1000000011_S0000077	THIS WAS KIND OF A SURPRISE FOR ME BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT YOU KNOW IF MY KID HAD A PROBLEM WITH MATH I COULD BOND WITH HIM BY SAYING HEY YOU KNOW IT WAS TOUGH FOR ME TOO
POD1000000011_S0000078	BUT ACTUALLY ROSEMARIE SAYS
POD1000000011_S0000079	SAYING I DON'T LIKE MATH I CAN'T DO MATH THAT WILL GET CONVEYED TO YOUR CHILDREN
POD1000000011_S0000080	THE SOLUTION INSTEAD WE NEED TO REFRAME MATH
POD1000000011_S0000081	YEAH ROSEMARIE SAYS THINK ABOUT THE FUN ACTIVITIES THAT CAN BACK UP AND REINFORCE WHAT THEY'RE LEARNING IN SCHOOL
POD1000000011_S0000082	MATH IS VERY MUCH AN INTEGRAL PART OF YOUR LIFE DO YOU LOVE MUSIC

POD1000000011_S0000088	WHAT'S IMPORTANT ROSEMARY SAYS IS RECOGNIZING MATH AS PART OF MANY THINGS THAT WE LIKE DOING TOGETHER

POD1000000011_S0000101	ONE OF THEIR ANSWERS MAKES UP OUR SECOND TAKEAWAY TAKEAWAY NUMBER TWO
POD1000000011_S0000102	TALK ABOUT MATH TAKE THIS REALLY ORDINARY MOMENT
POD1000000011_S0000103	YOU ASK THEM TO PUT THEIR BOOKS AWAY AND THEN SAY IT DOESN'T FIT IN THE SHELF SO WHY DOESN'T IT FIT
POD1000000011_S0000104	MAYBE THE BOOK IS TOO TALL TOO BIG
POD1000000011_S0000105	SUE SAYS YOU'RE ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT A MATH PROCESS IT'S PROBLEM SOLVING

POD1000000011_S0000116	NAMING THE SHAPES IN BOTH ENGLISH AND IN SPANISH WHEN WE PLAYED THIS TAPE FOR ROSEMARY SHE SAID
POD1000000011_S0000117	WHAT I HEARD THERE IS THE TEACHER USING DESCRIPTIVE MATH LANGUAGE AND THAT IS SO KEY FOR CHILDREN TO UNDERSTAND MATH CONCEPTS
POD1000000011_S0000118	YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPTS WITHOUT THE LANGUAGE
POD1000000011_S0000119	YEAH AND AMY'S NOT BUILDING THE BLOCK FOR THE KIDS SHE'S ACTUALLY MAKING OBSERVATIONS AND KIND OF LIKE NARRATING THEIR THOUGHTS IN REAL TIME

POD1000000011_S0000121	AND SHE SAID MORE BLOCKS TO MAKE IT LONGER I MEAN LONGER IS A COMPLEX WORD FOR CHILDREN
POD1000000011_S0000122	AND THEY NEED TO HEAR THAT LANGUAGE AND THEY NEED TO HEAR THAT LANGUAGE IN A VERY CONCRETE WAY
POD1000000011_S0000123	SHE WASN'T EVEN AFRAID TO USE REALLY TECHNICAL WORDS LIKE WHEN THIS LITTLE BOY WAS TRYING TO MAKE HIS LITTLE CORAL STAND UP

POD1000000011_S0000164	SO THE POINT IS PARENTS GET APPROXIMATELY ONE MILLION BILLION CHANCES ALL DAY LONG EVERY DAY EVERY NIGHT TO TALK ABOUT MATH
POD1000000011_S0000165	THAT IS OF COURSE A ROUGH ESTIMATE BUT THINK ABOUT IT
POD1000000011_S0000166	THE CALENDARS AND CLOCKS MONEY MAPS MEASURING CRAFTS
POD1000000011_S0000167	IT'S VERY BROAD AND I THINK THAT ONCE PARENTS UNDERSTAND THE BREADTH OF HOW WE DEFINE MATH AND HOW THEY ARE ALREADY DOING IT THEY GO OH THAT'S MATH
POD1000000011_S0000168	I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT WAS MATH OH IF THAT'S MATH THEN I COULD DO THAT
POD1000000011_S0000169	SETTING THE TABLE ONE TO ONE CORRESPONDENCE THAT'S MATH ORDINAL NUMBER FIRST SECOND THIRD THAT'S MATH
POD1000000011_S0000170	YEAH AND IF YOU NEED EVEN MORE CHANCES ROLL THE DICE IN OUR NEXT TAKEAWAY TAKEAWAY NUMBER THREE
POD1000000011_S0000171	PLAY MATH
POD1000000011_S0000172	FIND WAYS TO KEEP MATH IN MIND WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING WITH YOUR KIDS SODA SAYS YOU MAY ALREADY BE DOING THIS
POD1000000011_S0000173	JUST PLAY
POD1000000011_S0000174	AND RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT WHEN PARENTS JUST PLAY THEY'RE ACTUALLY REALLY REALLY GOOD AT PULLING OUT THESE DEEP CONCEPTS FROM CHILDREN MUCH BETTER THAN EVEN TEACHERS
POD1000000011_S0000175	THERE'S SO MANY WAYS TO PLAY MATH WITH KIDS OF ALL DIFFERENT AGES
POD1000000011_S0000176	RIGHT THERE ARE PUZZLES OF COURSE AND BLOCKS LIKE WE HEARD WITH AMY
POD1000000011_S0000177	THERE'S VIDEO GAMES AND APPS CARD GAMES AND ESPECIALLY BOARD GAMES
POD1000000011_S0000178	RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT THE MORE KIDS PLAY ANY GAME WITH DICE AND NUMBERED SQUARES THE BETTER THEIR BASIC MATH SKILLS GET
POD1000000011_S0000179	YOU CAN EVEN PLAY MATH OUTSIDE
POD1000000011_S0000180	I CAN GIVE A BIG PUSH TO THE SWING OR I CAN HOP THREE TIMES TO GO THERE
POD1000000011_S0000181	AT SUTAN'S HOUSE HOPSCOTCH HAD NEGATIVE ONE
POD1000000011_S0000183	WHICH WAS KIND OF MIND BLOWING TO ME
POD1000000011_S0000184	
POD1000000011_S0000185	AND SHE SAYS YOU KNOW PLAY CAN BE THE FOUNDATION EVEN OF ADVANCED SUBJECTS LIKE ALGEBRA
POD1000000011_S0000186	ALGEBRA IS YOU KNOW ALL THE MATH CONCEPTS ALGEBRA SEEMS TO SHAKE MANY PEOPLE'S NERVES
POD1000000011_S0000187	BUT WHAT IS ALGEBRA REALLY IF YOU THINK ABOUT
POD1000000011_S0000188	IT IS RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE PATTERNS IN NUMBERS THERE ARE PATTERNS IN EQUATIONS AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE TRYING TO BALANCE THE TWO SIDES OF IT
POD1000000011_S0000189	TAKE THIS LITTLE MOMENT IN AMY LOPEZ'S TODDLER ROOM
POD1000000011_S0000190	WHEN YOU PUT YOUR TRIANGLES TOGETHER IT MAKES A SQUARE LOOK
POD1000000011_S0000191	
POD1000000011_S0000192	SAME DAY
POD1000000011_S0000194	JUST LIKE THAT ONE YOU MADE A GREAT DISCOVERY
POD1000000011_S0000195	
POD1000000011_S0000196	EXACTLY SO AS YOU KNOW CORY I HAVE A TWO YEAR OLD AT HOME AND I WAS GETTING SO EXCITED AT THIS POINT
POD1000000011_S0000197	BECAUSE I FELT LIKE HEY I'M READY TO BE THE A PLUS EXTRA CREDIT MOM
POD1000000011_S0000198	GOING TO NARRATE EVERY MOMENT OF BLOCK TIME I'M GOING TO USE PERIMETER AND CUADRADO
POD1000000011_S0000199	RAIN IT IN CEMENT
POD1000000011_S0000200	WHAT
POD1000000011_S0000201	COME ON I'M RARING TO GO LET'S GET TO THOSE FLASH CARDS
POD1000000011_S0000203	REMEMBER SHE WARNED US
POD1000000011_S0000204	AND THIS REALLY RINGS TRUE FOR ME
POD1000000011_S0000205	ONE THING I WOULD TELL PARENTS NOT TO DO IS TO BECOME THE TEACHER IN THE HOUSE
POD1000000011_S0000206	ALL RIGHT
POD1000000011_S0000207	I GET THIS
POD1000000011_S0000208	YEAH I MEAN FOR ONE THING IT'S IT'S KIND OF ANNOYING
POD1000000011_S0000209	YOU KNOW WHEN WE PLAY WITH OUR FRIENDS WE'RE NOT CONSTANTLY ASKING THEM LET'S COUNT HOW MANY THERE IS THIS WHAT IS THE SHAPE WE DON'T DO THAT
POD1000000011_S0000210	SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT I DO WITH MY FRIENDS I QUIT MY FRIENDS
POD1000000011_S0000212	WANT TO HANG OUT WITH YOU
POD1000000011_S0000213	FINE
POD1000000011_S0000214	ALRIGHT THE MOST IMPORTANT REASON TO NOT BE SO HEAVYHANDED WHEN WE'RE PLAYING WITH OUR KIDS IS TAKEAWAY NUMBER FOUR
POD1000000011_S0000215	MATH LIKE LIFE IS SO MUCH MORE INTERESTING AND FUN WHEN WE CAN GET BEYOND RIGHT AND WRONG ANSWERS
POD1000000011_S0000216	FOR EXAMPLE SUE SAID THIS
POD1000000011_S0000217	WE'RE SITTING AT A ROUND TABLE AND I COULD ASK YOU ANY WHAT'S THE SHAPE OF THIS TABLE
POD1000000011_S0000218	I KNOW IT'S A CIRCLE YOU KNOW
POD1000000011_S0000219	I MEAN SO IT'S BUT A BETTER QUESTION WOULD BE TO SAY ANYA WHY DID YOU CHOOSE THE CIRCLE FOR OUR TABLE
POD1000000011_S0000220	THAT IS BETTER BECAUSE SHE'S ACTUALLY INTERESTED IN MY ANSWER SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY
POD1000000011_S0000221	I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU DID THAT RIGHT BUT THAT GETS US TALKING ABOUT SHAPES
POD1000000011_S0000222	IT'S A REAL CONVERSATION
POD1000000011_S0000223	YES AND IT'S THE KIND OF CONVERSATION THAT YOU COULD HAVE WITH KIDS AT ALMOST ANY AGE
POD1000000011_S0000224	OR ANOTHER INTERESTING QUESTION IT SAYS MIGHT BE HOW DO YOU KNOW THE TABLE IS ROUND
POD1000000011_S0000225	IT'S GOING TO MAKE THEM LOOK AT THAT CIRCLE ONE MORE TIME AND TO SEE THAT YOU KNOW THIS IT FEELS CURVY AND THE OTHER ONE FEELS SHARP ON THE EDGE
POD1000000011_S0000226	SO THE KEY HERE IS TO KEEP THINGS OPEN ENDED
POD1000000011_S0000227	SO WE SAW ANOTHER GREAT EXAMPLE OF THIS IN ONE OF THE OTHER PRE SCHOOL CLASSROOMS THERE'S A FOUR YEAR OLD BOY NAMED KILLEY KIND OF MESSING AROUND WITH SOME BLOCKS
POD1000000011_S0000228	AND THE TEACHER CARLA ALAMO WAS A MASTER SHE JUST BACKED OFF AND LET HIM DO HIS THING BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING
POD1000000011_S0000229	HE'S TRYING THINGS OUT HE'S TESTING OUT HYPOTHESES
POD1000000011_S0000230	THIS IS DATA IT'S PROBABILITY
POD1000000011_S0000231	IT'S NOT ABOUT GETTING TO A CERTAIN PLACE IN THE END
POD1000000011_S0000232	DO YOU WANT THE WHEEL TO GO UNDER IT OR OVER IT
POD1000000011_S0000233	
POD1000000011_S0000234	
POD1000000011_S0000235	AND REMEMBER THIS IS PLAY IT'S OPEN ENDED
POD1000000011_S0000236	THERE'S NO RIGHT OR WRONG SHE'S LETTING HIM FIGURE IT OUT
POD1000000011_S0000237	DO WE NEED TO CHANGE ANY BLOCKS OR ADD ANYTHING TO MAKE IT JUMP HIGHER
POD1000000011_S0000239	ROSEMARIE SAYS THERE'S A SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL POINT WE'RE MAKING THAT GOES DEEPER EVEN THAN THE MATH
POD1000000011_S0000240	THERE SHOULD BE NO FEAR IN MAKING A MISTAKE
POD1000000011_S0000241	LET'S SAY THAT AGAIN NO FEAR IN MAKING A MISTAKE
POD1000000011_S0000242	THAT'S BASICALLY HOW CHILDREN LEARN IT'S ALL TRIAL AND ERROR FOR THEM
POD1000000011_S0000243	AND THEY'RE ALSO LOOKING TO US HOW WE REACT TO MAKING A MISTAKE AND THAT'S PART OF RESILIENCY
POD1000000011_S0000244	AND IT'S REALLY HELPFUL TO COMMUNICATE THIS ATTITUDE WHEN OUR KIDS ARE A LITTLE OLDER LIKE MINE ARE AND THEY'RE LEARNING MATH IN SCHOOL ON SOMEBODY ELSE'S SCHEDULE
POD1000000011_S0000245	YEAH I MEAN THE PRESSURE JUST GETS HIGHER FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND SO THE MOST HELPFUL THAT WE CAN BE AS PARENTS IS NOT TO BE FROG MARCHING THEM THROUGH THEIR HOMEWORK BUT TRY TO MAKE IT FEEL OKAY TO MESS UP SOMETIMES AND ALSO TO KEEP GOING
POD1000000011_S0000246	BECAUSE IT'S ALL PART OF THE PROCESS
POD1000000011_S0000247	YEAH FAILURE IS IMPORTANT WHICH IS A LESSON THE COUNT HAD TO LEARN
POD1000000011_S0000248	I CANNOT BELIEVE IT THE COUNT MADE A COUNTING MISTAKE
POD1000000011_S0000249	JUST A LITTLE ONE
POD1000000011_S0000250	AS WE SAID IN THE BEGINNING YOU KNOW HE MESSED UP IT WASN'T HIS FAULT
POD1000000011_S0000251	DECIDES TO QUIT BEING THE COUNT
POD1000000011_S0000252	YEAH AND HE GOES IN SEARCH OF OTHER EMPLOYMENT
POD1000000011_S0000253	ALRIGHT CONSTRUCTION WORKING ALRIGHT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAMMER FIVE NAILS INTO THIS HERE BEAM
POD1000000011_S0000254	
POD1000000011_S0000255	TURNS OUT THERE'S THINGS YOU GOT TO COUNT IN DOING CONSTRUCTION AND MEASURING AND ALL THIS KIND OF STUFF SO THERE'S NO ESCAPING IT THERE
POD1000000011_S0000256	AGAIN THIS KEN SCARBOROUGH THE HEAD WRITER AT SESAME
POD1000000011_S0000257	SO HE LEFT THAT HE BECAME A ROCKET GUY THEY HAVE TO COUNT DOWN
POD1000000011_S0000258	TEN NINE
POD1000000011_S0000260	AND WHAT FINALLY GETS THE COUNT BACK ON TRACK IS ACTUALLY ANOTHER MISTAKE
POD1000000011_S0000261	HIS FRIEND ELMO STEPS IN AND PRETENDS TO MESS UP HIS OWN COUNTING JUST TO HELP THE COUNT KNOW THAT IT'S OKAY TO MESS
POD1000000011_S0000262	SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE
POD1000000011_S0000263	I NEED TEN CARROTS
POD1000000011_S0000264	WAIT I BELIEVE YOU MADE A MISTAKE ELMO
POD1000000011_S0000265	A MISTAKE
POD1000000011_S0000266	YES YOU SAID FOR TWICE YOU SHOULD COUNT THE CARROTS AGAIN
POD1000000011_S0000267	CAN'T TURN OFF THE CAR MADE A MISTAKE SOLOMOS GONNA GIVE UP
POD1000000011_S0000268	
POD1000000011_S0000269	
POD1000000011_S0000270	NO NO NO NO NO NO ELMO EVERYBODY MAKES ME
POD1000000011_S0000271	YOU CANNOT GIVE UP THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO KEEP TRYING
POD1000000011_S0000272	SURE ACTUALLY TOLD US THIS IS A GOOD TIP FOR PARENTS TO TRY TOO YOU CAN MAKE A MISTAKE AND GIVE YOUR KIDS A CHANCE TO CORRECT YOU WITH MATH OR YOU KNOW ANYTHING ELSE
POD1000000011_S0000273	I DID GIVE UP BUT I SHOULDN'T HAVE I MUST KEEP TRYING AND YOU SHOULD TOO

POD1000000012_S0000111	AND WE'RE GOING TO FINISH OUR CONVO WITH COOKIE MONSTER IN JUST A FEW MINUTES
POD1000000012_S0000112	BUT FIRST WE SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE IT'S PRETTY SURPRISING THAT COOKIES BECOME SO SKILLED AT SELF REGULATION
POD1000000012_S0000113	SO I REMEMBER AS A CHILD WATCHING COOKIE MONSTER AND JUST BEING LIKE WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS MANIAC
POD1000000012_S0000115	THAT'S KENTARO FUJITA AN EXPERT ON SELF REGULATION WHO WE'LL TALK TO IN A BIT
POD1000000012_S0000116	YEAH I HAVE TO AGREE ON THE COOKIE WE GREW UP WITH
POD1000000012_S0000117	KOWABUNGA
POD1000000012_S0000119	WAS PURE
POD1000000012_S0000121	
POD1000000012_S0000123	
POD1000000012_S0000125	BUT ROSEMARIE FROM SESAME SAYS COOKIES TRANSFORMATION WAS ACTUALLY REALLY REALLY INTENTIONAL
POD1000000012_S0000126	SESAME STREET EVERY YEAR WE FOCUS ON A CRITICAL EDUCATIONAL NEED IN CHILDREN'S LIVES
POD1000000012_S0000127	AND IT WAS ABOUT SEVEN EIGHT YEARS AGO WHEN ALL OF THIS RESEARCH STARTED TO COME OUT SHOWING THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE SELF REGULATION SKILLS AND HOW THEY WERE RELATED TO SCHOOL ACHIEVEMENT SCHOOL READINESS AND LIFE LESSONS
POD1000000012_S0000129	AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHY WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THIS TODAY
POD1000000012_S0000130	YEAH AND SESAME DECIDED ONCE THEY KNEW ALL OF THIS THAT COOKIE MONSTER WAS THE PERFECT MUPPET TO SEND THIS MESSAGE
POD1000000012_S0000131	LET'S NOT DEFINE HIM AS THIS IMPULSIVE CHARACTER WHO HAS NO SELF CONTROL BECAUSE HE CAN HAVE SELF CONTROL
POD1000000012_S0000132	SO AFTER
POD1000000012_S0000134	YEARS
POD1000000012_S0000135	COOKIE EVOLVE
POD1000000012_S0000136	
POD1000000012_S0000137	AND HE BECOMES SOMEONE WHO WAS
POD1000000012_S0000138	IS MUCH MORE REFLECTIVE WHO CAN ACTUALLY STOP AND PAUSE AND CONTROL HIS EMOTIONS AND HIS DESIRE FOR EATING THE COOKIE RIGHT AWAY
POD1000000012_S0000139	THAT'S INSPIRING ROSEMARIE
POD1000000012_S0000140	YES IT IS
POD1000000012_S0000142	IT'S INSPIRING FOR ME AS A FORTY TWO YEAR OLD THAT I HAVE ONE MORE YEAR TO GET ALL MY SELF CONTROL TOGETHER
POD1000000012_S0000143	I BELIEVE IN YOU
POD1000000012_S0000144	WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH SESAME'S HOPE HERE WAS
POD1000000012_S0000145	THAT WE COULD MODEL THESE STRATEGIES FOR CHILDREN TO LEARN AND APPLY THESE STRATEGIES AND BUILD THEIR OWN SELF REGULATION TOOLBOX
POD1000000012_S0000146	AND SEVERAL YEARS AGO SEMI PACKED A STUDY TO SEE IF THIS COULD REALLY WORK
POD1000000012_S0000147	AND SO SOME OF THE KIDS IN THE STUDY WATCHED VIDEOS OF COOKIE MONSTER PRACTICING HIS STRATEGIES KIND OF LIKE YOU HEARD AT THE TOP OF THE PODCAST
POD1000000012_S0000148	GOT NEW STRATEGY
POD1000000012_S0000150	THEN ROSEMARIE SAYS THE RESEARCHER TEMPTED ALL THE KIDS WITH THEIR FAVORITE SNACK
POD1000000012_S0000151	CHOCOLATE CHIPS
POD1000000012_S0000153	AND THE KIDS WHO WATCHED COOKIE MONSTER
POD1000000012_S0000154	ON AVERAGE WAITED FOR ADDITIONAL MINUTES
POD1000000012_S0000155	FOUR MINUTES THAT IS HUGE FOR A PRESCHOOLER
POD1000000012_S0000156	
POD1000000012_S0000158	SO LET'S BREAK THIS DOWN FOR A MINUTE
POD1000000012_S0000159	
POD1000000012_S0000160	WHAT DOES NOT EATING COOKIES HAVE TO DO WITH BEING SUCCESSFUL IN SCHOOL OR IN YOUR LIFE
POD1000000012_S0000161	ROSEMARY EXPLAINED THAT SELF REGULATION ISN'T JUST ABOUT TREATS SELF REGULATION IS A SET OF SKILLS THAT HELPS US REACH OUR GOALS
POD1000000012_S0000162	SPECIFICALLY WE NEED TO EITHER MONITOR OR CHANGE OR REDIRECT OUR THOUGHTS FEELINGS AND BEHAVIOR TOWARDS A PARTICULAR GOAL THAT WE'VE CHOSEN
POD1000000012_S0000163	AND WITHIN SELF REGULATION YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR US TALK A LOT IN THIS EPISODE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT SELF CONTROL WHICH IS EITHER RESISTING AN IMPULSE OR OVERCOMING TEMPTATION ON THE WAY TO A GOAL
POD1000000012_S0000164	SELF CONTROL MEANS MORE THAN RESISTING A COOKIE
POD1000000012_S0000165	IT MEANS NOT HITTING A CLASSMATE ON THE PLAYGROUND WHEN HE TAKES A TRICYCLE
POD1000000012_S0000166	IT MEANS WORKING THROUGH YOUR MATH HOMEWORK AND NOT THROWING A TANTRUM WHEN YOU GET STUMPED
POD1000000012_S0000167	YEAH IT CAN EVEN MEAN WORKING THROUGH A BIG FEAR THAT YOU HAVE WHEN IT OVERWHELMS YOU
POD1000000012_S0000168	AND ALL OF THIS IS A BIG DEAL RIGHT NOW NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE NEW RESEARCH THAT ROSEMARY REFERENCED BUT ALSO BECAUSE THERE'S JUST MORE AND MORE KIDS OUT THERE WITH DIAGNOSED ISSUES THAT CAN INTERFERE WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF SELF REGULATION
POD1000000012_S0000169	THINGS LIKE CHILDHOOD TRAUMA ADHD OR BEING ON THE AUTISM SPECTRUM
POD1000000012_S0000170	ALSO MANY PARENTS ESPECIALLY PRIVILEGED PARENTS ARE BASICALLY STEPPING INTO THEIR KIDS' LIVES TO SMOOTH OVER THEIR KIDS PATHS AND REMOVE ANY SOURCES OF FRUSTRATION REALLY BEFORE THEIR KIDS HAVE A CHANCE TO LEARN HOW TO DEAL WITH IT
POD1000000012_S0000171	I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CORE
POD1000000012_S0000172	APPRECIATE YOUR HONESTY
POD1000000012_S0000173	I MEAN I CAN SEE THAT THIS IS VERY WELL MEANING AND A LOT OF PARENTS JUST WANT THE BEST FOR THEIR KIDS IN A REALLY COMPETITIVE WORLD
POD1000000012_S0000174	BUT WHAT WE'RE DOING ALSO DEPRIVES THEM OF THE NATURAL OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE TO LEARN SELF REGULATION ALONG THE WAY
POD1000000012_S0000175	AND THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON IN IN CHILDREN'S LIVES RIGHT NOW THAT THEY ARE BECOMING RISK AVERSE
POD1000000012_S0000176	THEY WANT EVERYTHING DONE FOR THEM
POD1000000012_S0000177	AND SO SESAME DECIDED TO SEND THE MESSAGE THAT YOU KNOW IF COOKIE MONSTER CAN LEARN TO CONTROL HIMSELF ANYBODY CAN
POD1000000012_S0000178	BUT I WAS KIND OF SKEPTICAL CORE I WANTED TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE SCIENCE OF THIS
POD1000000012_S0000179	BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY I SEE THAT MY KIDS AS THEY GROW UP THEY GET BETTER AT SELF REGULATION MY TWO YEAR OLD IS NOT AS GOOD AT WAITING AS MY SEVEN YEAR OLD
POD1000000012_S0000180	
POD1000000012_S0000181	SO YOU KNOW IS THIS REALLY SOMETHING I NEED TO COACH MY KIDS ON IS THIS LIKE DO I HAVE TO SEND THEM TO SELF CONTROL SUMMER CAMP
POD1000000012_S0000183	YES AND NO
POD1000000012_S0000184	SOME OF THE VARIATION IS GENETIC AND AND YOU'RE RIGHT THAT CHILDREN'S BRAINS DO NATURALLY DEVELOP ALONG THESE LINES
POD1000000012_S0000185	BUT KEN FUJITA WHO WE HEARD FROM EARLIER WHO SAID COOKIE MONSTER WAS A MANIAC
POD1000000012_S0000186	
POD1000000012_S0000187	HE HAPPENS TO BE A PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY AT THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY AND HE DESCRIBES IT THIS WAY
POD1000000012_S0000188	SO THE BRAIN YOU CAN THINK OF AS BEING LIKE THE HARDWARE
POD1000000012_S0000189	BUT EVEN WHEN WE HAVE THE HARDWARE WE STILL NEED TO LEARN HOW TO USE THE HARDWARE WITH THE RIGHT SOFTWARE
POD1000000012_S0000190	SO BY SOFTWARE KEN'S TALKING ABOUT THE SKILLS AND THE STRATEGIES THAT PARENTS CAN HELP KIDS PRACTICE TO IMPROVE THEIR SELF REGULATE
POD1000000012_S0000191	EXACTLY
POD1000000012_S0000192	THERE IS A LOT OF RESEARCH SUPPORTING VERY SPECIFIC INTERVENTIONS SO WITHOUT MAKING EVERYBODY WAIT ANY LONGER LET'S OPEN UP THE TOOLBOX AND GET RIGHT TO OUR TAKEAWAYS
POD1000000012_S0000194	ALL RIGHT AND TAKEAWAY NUMBER ONE IS BIG PICTURE ADVICE FOR US PARENTS
POD1000000012_S0000196	WE NEED TO START THINKING OF SELF REGULATION AS A SKILL TO BE PRACTICED
POD1000000012_S0000197	EXACTLY
POD1000000012_S0000198	SO THIS PART MADE ME THINK ABOUT WHEN MY HUSBAND WAS TEACHING OUR OLDER DAUGHTER LULU TO SKI RIGHT
POD1000000012_S0000199	FIRST SHE WAS KIND OF FREAKED OUT THE MOUNTAIN IS BIG
POD1000000012_S0000200	SHE IS SMALL IT IS COLD
POD1000000012_S0000201	AND HE HAD TO BEGIN BY REALLY ACKNOWLEDGING ALL OF THE BIG FEELINGS THAT SHE WAS HAVING AND ROSEMARIE SAYS WE SHOULD DO THE SAME THING WHEN WE'RE WORKING ON A SKILL
POD1000000012_S0000202	YOU NEED TO VALIDATE CHILDREN'S EMOTIONS I KNOW IT'S HARD
POD1000000012_S0000203	I KNOW IT'S HARD THE WORST THING TO BE IS LIKE YOU KNOW IT'S EASY DON'T WORRY NO
POD1000000012_S0000204	SO YOU'VE DONE THAT EMPATHIZING AND THEN YOU HAVE TO MOVE ON TO THE NUTS AND BOLTS
POD1000000012_S0000205	WHAT IS IT THAT YOU ACTUALLY DO YOU KNOW YOU DON'T JUST TELL THE KID SKI DOWN THE HILL AND YOU DON'T JUST TELL A KID CONTROL YOURSELF
POD1000000012_S0000206	YEAH DON'T DON'T THROW A TANTRUM
POD1000000012_S0000207	
POD1000000012_S0000208	DOESN'T WORK YOU CAN'T DO IT THAT WAY
POD1000000012_S0000209	SO WHEN YOU'RE SKIING YOU BREAK DOWN THE SKILL INTO TINY PIECES AND THERE ARE STRATEGIES THAT YOU CAN USE FOR EACH ONE
POD1000000012_S0000210	FOR EXAMPLE WHEN YOU WANT TO SLOW DOWN YOU POINT THE TOES TOWARDS EACH OTHER AND THE THE CODE WORD FOR THAT IS PIZZA
POD1000000012_S0000211	IT'S A SLICE OF PIZZA THE TWO IS COMING TOGETHER
POD1000000012_S0000212	THANK YOU LIFE KIT SKIING
POD1000000012_S0000213	YES NOW THE ANALOGY HERE IS WE'RE TAKING SELF REGULATION OR SELF CONTROL THESE BIG BIG CONCEPTS AND WE'RE BREAKING THEM DOWN INTO VERY SPECIFIC STRATEGIES THAT WE WANT OUR KIDS TO TRY
POD1000000012_S0000214	RIGHT AND THE OTHER KEY THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT OUR KIDS ARE GOING TO FAIL AND PROBABLY FAIL A LOT
POD1000000012_S0000215	
POD1000000012_S0000216	BEFORE THEY SUCCEED AND AND WE REALLY HAVE TO NOT ONLY ACCEPT THAT FAILURE BUT PRAISE THEIR EFFORT EVERY CHANCE WE GET
POD1000000012_S0000217	SO EVEN IF IT IS I JUST WAITED A MINUTE PRAISE THE EFFORT I WAITED A MINUTE
POD1000000012_S0000218	YEAH AND NEXT TIME MAYBE THEY'LL WAIT TWO MINUTES
POD1000000012_S0000219	TOTALLY AND HERE'S THE THING I MEAN OBVIOUSLY NOT EVERY KID NEEDS TO LEARN TO SKI BUT EVERY KID NEEDS TO LEARN TO REGULATE THEIR EMOTIONS
POD1000000012_S0000220	AND THEY CAN AS LONG AS THEY HAVE A COACH
POD1000000012_S0000221	YEAH SO LET'S LET'S LOOK AT SELF CONTROL AGAIN WHAT IS THE FIRST STEP TO NOT HITTING YOUR FRIEND OR NOT THROWING YOUR HOMEWORK ACROSS THE ROOM
POD1000000012_S0000222	TYING YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK
POD1000000012_S0000224	A BETTER WAY IS NOT GETTING SO MAD IN THE FIRST PLACE
POD1000000012_S0000225	AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO START HERE WHEN IT COMES TO TEACHING OUR KIDS TO REGULATE THEIR EMOTIONS BECAUSE IT'S SELF REGULATION RIGHT
POD1000000012_S0000226	SO TAKEAWAY NUMBER TWO YELLING CALM DOWN AT YOUR KIDS WHEN THEY GET REALLY WORKED UP THAT DOESN'T WORK
POD1000000012_S0000227	YEAH I KNOW THIS BECAUSE I'VE TRIED IT
POD1000000012_S0000229	HAVE TRIED IT TOO MANY TIMES
POD1000000012_S0000230	I MEAN IT'S JUST REALLY COMMON TO RESPOND TO OUR KIDS FRUSTRATION WITH OUR OWN FRUSTRATION
POD1000000012_S0000231	BUT THERE IS SOMETHING THAT CAN HELP BOTH OF US AS LONG AS WE'RE CONSISTENT BOTH OUR KIDS AND OURSELVES AND THAT IS OUR SLOW DEEP BREATHING
POD1000000012_S0000232	BELLY BREATHING COMES IN SO TAKING THOSE DEEP SLOW BREATHS IN AND OUT
POD1000000012_S0000234	JUST LIKE I DID WITH COOKIE MONSTER I KNOW IT WAS SILLY AND PROBABLY SOUNDED A LITTLE RIDICULOUS
POD1000000012_S0000235	BUT IT WORKS I DO IT AT HOME DO IT AT WORK
POD1000000012_S0000236	YOU CAN ASK ALL OF THE LIFEKIT PRODUCERS IT WORKS
POD1000000012_S0000237	AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE IT A HABIT
POD1000000012_S0000238	AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S NOT ALL CORY
POD1000000012_S0000239	YOU CAN TEACH YOUR KID TO HUG A PILLOW OR A STUFFED ANIMAL TO CALM DOWN YOU CAN ALSO TRY THIS CRAFT
POD1000000012_S0000240	OKAY TAKE A JAR FILL IT WITH GLUE WATER AND GLITTER
POD1000000012_S0000241	AND THEN MAKE SURE YOU SCREW THE LID ON REALLY TIGHT THAT'S IMPORTANT
POD1000000012_S0000243	AND WHENEVER THEY'RE FEELING STRESSED OUT YOU CAN TELL YOUR KIDS TO GIVE THAT JAR A SHAKE
POD1000000012_S0000244	I KNOW I'M OVERWHELMED RIGHT NOW BUT LET ME JUST BREATHE AND FOCUS ON HOW THAT GLITTER IS SWIRLING AROUND WHICH REPRESENTS MY FEELINGS RIGHT NOW
POD1000000012_S0000245	BUT IF I BELLY BREATHE AND WATCH THE GLITTER SETTLE IT GIVES ME THE TIME TO CALM DOWN
POD1000000012_S0000247	ALRIGHT SO BELLY BREATHING GLITTER JARS OUR NEXT TAKEAWAY ZEROS IN VERY SPECIFICALLY ON SELF CONTROL
POD1000000012_S0000248	THAT'S RIGHT TAKEAWAY NUMBER THREE PRETEND THE COOKIE IS PLASTIC
POD1000000012_S0000250	ALL RIGHT SO YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD OF THE MARSHMALLOW TEST
POD1000000012_S0000251	IT WAS A FAMOUS STUDY THAT WAS DONE WHERE CHILDREN WERE OFFERED A MARSHMALLOW TO EAT
POD1000000012_S0000252	AND THEY WERE TOLD THEY COULD EAT IT RIGHT AWAY BUT IF THEY WAITED THEY COULD HAVE TWO OF THE TREATS LATER
POD1000000012_S0000253	YEAH SO THIS STUDY IS SO FAMOUS IF YOU JUST GO TO YOUTUBE AND TYPE IN MARSHMALLOW TEST YOU'LL FIND ALL KINDS OF VIDEOS OF KIDS BEING SUBJECTED TO THIS SORT OF TORMENT
POD1000000012_S0000254	I'M GONNA GO DO SOMETHING AND THEN I'LL COME BACK
POD1000000012_S0000255	SO YUMMY
POD1000000012_S0000257	I FEEL REALLY GOOD
POD1000000012_S0000258	THE EXPERIMENT HAS BEEN REPEATED MANY MANY TIMES SINCE IT WAS FIRST DONE BY WALTER MISCHEL IN THE LATE NINETEEN SIXTY S
POD1000000012_S0000259	AND THERE HAS BEEN SOME CONTROVERSY OVER WHAT IT EXACTLY PROVED ESPECIALLY WITH SOME OF THE LONG TERM OUTCOMES AND WHEN YOU TAKE FACTORS LIKE SOCIAL CLASS INTO CONSIDERATION
POD1000000012_S0000260	YES ABSOLUTELY BUT AT THE SAME TIME THAT BASIC EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN WITH KIDS AND TREATS AND A TIMER
POD1000000012_S0000261	IT'S A REALLY GOOD CONTEXT TO SEE THE STRATEGIES THAT CHILDREN CAN AND DO USE WHEN THEIR SELF CONTROL IS BEING TESTED
POD1000000012_S0000262	WHAT SEEMS TO LEAD KIDS TO BE TEMPTED BY THE SMALLER IMMEDIATE REWARD THE ONE MARSHMALLOW IS THE FACT THAT THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT IT IN A HOT WAY
POD1000000012_S0000263	AND BY HOT KEN FUJITA MEANS INTENSE OR URGENT SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO ACT ON RIGHT NOW BUT HE SAYS
POD1000000012_S0000264	IF KIDS COULD FIND DIFFERENT WAYS TO COOL THEIR THOUGHTS THEY WERE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO WAIT OUT THE DELAY
POD1000000012_S0000265	AND THAT KNOWING THESE STRATEGIES SEEMED TO PREDICT WHICH KIDS WERE ABLE TO DELAY AND WHICH ONES WERE NOT
POD1000000012_S0000266	FOR EXAMPLE KIDS PRETENDED THE MARSHMALLOWS WERE JUST PUFFY CLOUDS OR THAT THEY WERE LOOKING AT THE MARSHMALLOWS THROUGH A PICTURE FRAME
POD1000000012_S0000267	WHAT I REALLY LIKE ABOUT THIS CORY IS THAT KIDS ARE USING A STRENGTH OR IMAGINATIONS TO OVERCOME THEIR WEAKNESS IN SELF CONTROL OR DELAYING GRATIFICATION
POD1000000012_S0000268	AND ROSEMARY TOLD US THAT PRACTICING THESE STRATEGIES AND LEARNING THEM LEARNING ABOUT THEM CAN BE REALLY EMPOWERING AND ACTUALLY THERAPEUTIC ESPECIALLY FOR KIDS WHO STRUGGLE WITH SELF REGULATION
POD1000000012_S0000269	YEAH AND ALL THE EXPERTS TOLD US IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THAT PRACTICE NOT ONLY HAPPEN IN MOMENTS OF CRISIS BUT YOU REALLY LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR IT SO THAT WHEN THOSE HOT FEELINGS ARISE THEY TURN TO THE STRATEGY AND USE IT
POD1000000012_S0000270	YOU PLANT IT AND THEN IT PAYS
POD1000000012_S0000271	THEN IT PAYS OFF LATER EXACTLY
POD1000000012_S0000273	NOW TAKEAWAY NUMBER FOUR SPEAKING OF IMAGINATION THIS IS MY FAVORITE TAKEAWAY
POD1000000012_S0000275	I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS ONE WHAT WOULD THAT MEN DO
POD1000000012_S0000276	YEAH KEN REGINA TOLD US ABOUT A FASCINATING STUDY
POD1000000012_S0000277	IT'S A VARIATION ON THE MARSHMALLOW TEST WHERE RESEARCHERS ASKED KIDS TO DO A VERY BORING TASK WHILE THEY WERE SIMULTANEOUSLY TEMPTED TO PLAY A FUN VIDEO GAME AT THE SAME TIME
POD1000000012_S0000278	BUT THEN
POD1000000012_S0000279	THEY ASKED KIDS TO TO IDENTIFY THEIR FAVORITE SUPERHERO
POD1000000012_S0000280	AND THIS IS SO NEAT WE TALKED ABOUT THIS IN A PREVIOUS EPISODE
POD1000000012_S0000281	CHARACTERS LIKE SUPERHEROES OR PRINCESSES THEY'RE SO POWERFUL FOR KIDS WHOSE SELF IMAGES ARE REALLY JUST STARTING TO FORM
POD1000000012_S0000282	SO IF KIDS SAID BATMAN FOR EXAMPLE THEY WOULD GET A BATMAN MASK AND A BATMAN CAPE
POD1000000012_S0000283	I'M BATMAN IN
POD1000000012_S0000285	THEN THE KIDS WERE TOLD WHILE THEY WERE WAITING OUT THE DELAY THEY SHOULD ASK THEMSELVES THE QUESTION WHAT WOULD BATMAN DO
POD1000000012_S0000286	AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS REALLY STARTLING
POD1000000012_S0000287	SO THE KIDS WHO WERE CHANNELING THEIR HEROES WERE MUCH MORE ABLE TO RESIST THE TEMPTATION
POD1000000012_S0000288	I LOVE THIS I'M TOTALLY GOING TO USE THIS ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW IT'S A PROBLEM BECAUSE LIKE FOR ME IT WOULDN'T BE THE NORMAL BUT IT WOULD
POD1000000012_S0000290	OR LOOK OVER THERE IT'S BRIGHT
POD1000000012_S0000292	
POD1000000012_S0000294	I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE NICE NICE COMMENTS
POD1000000012_S0000296	TAKEAWAY NUMBER FIVE BE SMART ABOUT DISTRACTIONS
POD1000000012_S0000297	GETTING OUT OF A HOT MOMENT SOMETIMES CAN TAKE DISTRACTION JUST LIKE WHEN YOU ASK COOKIE MONSTER ABOUT HIS TASTE IN RUSSIAN LITERATURE
POD1000000012_S0000298	RIGHT OR LIKE WHEN YOU'RE IN THE CAR WITH YOUR KIDS AND SUDDENLY THEY TRANSITION FROM ARE WE THERE YET TO MOM HE'S HITTING ME DAD HE'S HITTING ME
POD1000000012_S0000299	THAT IS THE PERFECT TIME TO RESORT TO A DISTRACTION LIKE TRAVEL BINGO OR THE LICENSE PLATE GAME
POD1000000012_S0000300	I'M GOING TO TAKE MY ATTENTION OFF OF THIS TREAT AND PLACE MY ATTENTION ON SOMETHING ELSE SO I'M GOING TO GO PLAY WITH SOMETHING ELSE
POD1000000012_S0000301	RIGHT AND EVERY PARENT KNOWS LIKE ROSEMARIE SAYS YOU NEED TO HAVE A LONG LIST OF POTENTIAL DISTRACTIONS UP YOUR SLEEVE RIGHT
POD1000000012_S0000302	IT COULD BE READING IT COULD BE SINGING
POD1000000012_S0000303	IT CAN BE DABBING

POD1000000013_S0000011	WHERE WAS I BORN I WAS BORN IN BELFAST NORTHERN IRELAND
POD1000000013_S0000012	I WAS BORN INTO A LARGE FAMILY I WAS THE YOUNGEST OF A FAMILY OF SIX
POD1000000013_S0000013	WEST BELFAST IN THE NINETEEN SIXTY S WHEN I WAS BORN WAS A PLACE OF MUCH TURMOIL
POD1000000013_S0000014	AND MY EARLY
POD1000000013_S0000016	EARLY CHILDHOOD ADULT LIFE AND INTO MY TIME AT UNIVERSITY WAS VERY MUCH A TIME OF CONFLICT IN NORTHERN IRELAND
POD1000000013_S0000017	I CAME FROM A VERY RELIGIOUS BACKGROUND WHERE VALUES ARE VERY IMPORTANT
POD1000000013_S0000018	SO THERE WAS A WILLINGNESS AND DESIRE ON THE PART OF MY MOM AND DAD TO BRING US UP REGARDLESS TO RESPECT EVERYBODY AND TO RESPECT EVERYONE'S VIEWS AND RELIGION
POD1000000013_S0000020	THAT'S INTERESTING AND THAT REALLY ANTICIPATES THE FOLLOW UP QUESTION WHICH IS WHAT DO YOU LEARN AND TAKE FROM THOSE AWFUL SITUATIONS
POD1000000013_S0000021	THE NEED FOR FAIRNESS IS VERY IS VERY IMPORTANT PART OF COMMUNITIES GETTING GETTING ON TOGETHER
POD1000000013_S0000022	IF ONE COMMUNITY FEELS THEY'VE BEEN DEALT WITH UNFAIRLY OR INDEED ONE INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS THAT THAT IS YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY DESTABILIZING FOR SOCIETY AND FOR THAT COMMUNITY
POD1000000013_S0000023	SO I REALIZED VERY EARLY ON SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS PROBABLY PART OF MY NATURE WHICH IS THIS DESIRE FOR FAIRNESS
POD1000000013_S0000025	DOES THAT EXPLAIN WHY YOU TOOK A LAW DEGREE
POD1000000013_S0000026	IN PART ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE SPOKEN ABOUT OPENLY IS THE FACT THAT I WAS IN YOU KNOW A CONVENT SCHOOL
POD1000000013_S0000027	AND I WAS THERE WAS A PARTICULAR DAY I WAS CALLED OUT AT ASSEMBLY
POD1000000013_S0000028	I WAS TWELVE THIRTEEN AND I WAS HUGELY HUMILIATED EMBARRASSED BY THE FACT THAT I WAS BEING ACCUSED OF STEALING ANOTHER CURLESS JESUS WHEN I HADN'T
POD1000000013_S0000029	IT WAS A MISTAKE AND THAT MISTAKE CAME OUT BUT I REMEMBER THAT THAT FEELING
POD1000000013_S0000030	I THINK THAT WAS THE MORE CATHARTIC MOMENT IF YOU LIKE THE FEELING OF IT'S NOT I WAS ON MY OWN
POD1000000013_S0000031	AND I WAS DEALT WITH UNFAIRLY AND I WANTED TO BE A LAWYER BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO HELP PEOPLE THAT WERE TREATED UNFAIRLY
POD1000000013_S0000032	THAT'S WHAT MADE ME WANT TO BE A LAWYER REALLY
POD1000000013_S0000033	OKAY
POD1000000013_S0000034	AND AFTER UNIVERSITY I KNOW YOU BECAME A SOLICITOR BUT WAS THAT STRAIGHTAWAY
POD1000000013_S0000035	YES YES I DIDN'T I KNOW NOWADAYS THE GAP HERE
POD1000000013_S0000036	BUT YES I WENT TO THE INSTITUTE OF LEGAL STUDIES AND PRACTICED AS A SOLICITOR IN PRIVATE PRACTICE AND THEN IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR
POD1000000013_S0000037	MOSTLY LITIGATION BUT STARTED TO FOCUS ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND DATA PROTECTION FREEDOM OF INFORMATION WHEN I WAS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR
POD1000000013_S0000038	SO WHEN DID YOU JOIN THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE
POD1000000013_S0000039	TWO THOUSAND AND THREE
POD1000000013_S0000040	OKAY AND WHAT DID WHAT DID YOU DO BEFORE THEN
POD1000000013_S0000041	BEFORE THEN I WAS I WORKED FOR THE THE HOUSING AUTHORITY
POD1000000013_S0000042	WORKED FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS IN THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT OF THE HOUSING AUTHORITY DEALING WITH INTRACTABLE PROBLEMS SUCH AS ANTI SOCIAL BEHAVIOR HOMELESSNESS FRACTURED COMMUNITIES WHO HAD TO BE HOUSED NEAR TO EACH OTHER
POD1000000013_S0000043	
POD1000000013_S0000044	SO ISSUES SUCH AS PEACE WALLS
POD1000000013_S0000045	SO IT WAS GOOD IT WAS A GOOD GROUNDING IF YOU LIKE FOR DEALING WITH THE ISSUES THAT I DEAL WITH NOW BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF THE INFORMATION
POD1000000013_S0000046	YOU KNOW I RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR FOR FREEDOM OF INFORMATION AND FOR PEOPLE'S INFORMATION TO BE PROTECTED
POD1000000013_S0000047	AND I REALLY LOVED MY TIME IN THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE I WAS THERE FIVE YEARS
POD1000000013_S0000048	AND YOU SPENT SOME OF IT IN MANCHESTER
POD1000000013_S0000050	A TREAT
POD1000000013_S0000051	
POD1000000013_S0000052	PRIVILEGE
POD1000000013_S0000053	
POD1000000013_S0000054	AND IT WAS A TIME OF EMERGING FROM YOU KNOW THE OFFICE WAS CHANGING FROM BEING THE DATA PROTECTION COMMISSIONER KIND OF A REGISTRATION FUNCTION
POD1000000013_S0000055	TAKEN ON FREEDOM OF INFORMATION WHICH WAS SO EXCITING
POD1000000013_S0000056	AND IT WAS ABOUT THE OFFICE GETTING GEARED UP FOR FREEDOM OF INFORMATION AND INDEED HAVING REGIONAL OFFICES
POD1000000013_S0000057	THE ONE IN NORTHERN IRELAND I ACTUALLY HELPED ESTABLISH THAT OFFICE
POD1000000013_S0000058	AND WHEN DID YOU BECOME AN OMBUDSMAN
POD1000000013_S0000059	IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE SO AFTER LEAVING THE IO I WENT BACK TO PRIVATE PRACTICE
POD1000000013_S0000060	I WORKED IN A COMMERCIAL LAW FIRM AND THEN REALIZED THAT REALLY WASN'T FOR ME THAT I WAS MUCH MORE MY MY MAIN INTEREST WAS SOCIAL JUSTICE
POD1000000013_S0000061	I SAW THE ROLE OF DEPUTY OMBUDSMAN AND I THOUGHT THAT'S INTERESTING I THINK I'LL I'LL PUT MY HAT IN THE RING FOR THAT
POD1000000013_S0000062	AND YEAH I WAS LUCKY I GOT THE JOB
POD1000000013_S0000063	AND YOU ARE LUCKY ENOUGH TO WORK FOR THE LEGENDARY TOM RAWLE
POD1000000013_S0000064	DR FRAWLEY YEAH HE'S HE'S BEEN A HUGE SUPPORT TO ME THROUGHOUT MY CAREER AND I'VE YOU KNOW A MENTOR
POD1000000013_S0000065	AND LEGENDARY
POD1000000013_S0000066	WE'RE TALKING EARLIER TODAY ABOUT LEADERSHIP AND HIS FAMOUS PHRASE ON LEADERSHIP IS I AM THEIR LEADER WHICH WAY DID THEY GO
POD1000000013_S0000068	IT'S KIND OF YOU KNOW FOR TO BE A LEADER YOU NEED TO HAVE FOLLOWERS
POD1000000013_S0000069	ABSOLUTELY
POD1000000013_S0000070	OKAY SO FOR OUR ENGLISH LISTENERS AND FOR THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES NORTHERN IRELAND IS OBVIOUSLY UNIQUE POLITICALLY AND SOCIALLY
POD1000000013_S0000071	BUT I DON'T THINK THAT MANY OF US HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THIS MUST HAVE IMPACTED ON YOUR WORK AS AN OMBUDSMAN
POD1000000013_S0000072	COULD YOU SAY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT
POD1000000013_S0000073	WELL I THINK BECAUSE THE FIRST OMBUDSMAN'S OFFICE IN NORTHERN IRELAND WAS CREATED IN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE SO WE ARE WE ARE CELEBRATING OUR FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY YEAR THIS YEAR
POD1000000013_S0000074	IT WAS CREATED TO DEAL WITH COMPLAINTS OF DISCRIMINATION IN HOUSING EMPLOYMENT PARTICULARLY IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT
POD1000000013_S0000075	I THINK THAT THE GENESIS THE IDEA FOR AN OMBUDSMAN WAS TO BRING FAIRNESS TO THE CITIZEN
POD1000000013_S0000076	AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S REALLY BEEN ALWAYS A KEY ELEMENT OF THE WORK OF THE OFFICE
POD1000000013_S0000077	WE FEEL VERY VERY STRONGLY THAT WE ARE IN THE JUSTICE BUSINESS THAT IT IS ABOUT YOU KNOW BEING FAIR
POD1000000013_S0000078	AND NOT ONLY BEING FAIR TO COMPLAINANTS OR PEOPLE WHO FEEL THAT PUBLIC SERVICES SERVICES HAVE FAILED THEM BUT BEING FAIR TO THOSE WHO ARE WRONGLY CRITICIZED OR WRONGLY BLAMED
POD1000000013_S0000079	I THINK AN OMBUDSMAN THE ROLE OF AN OMBUDSMAN IS ALSO TO PROVIDE VINDICATION WHEN THINGS HAVE GONE RIGHT
POD1000000013_S0000080	WHAT ABOUT THE IMPACT OF SECTARIANISM ON YOUR WORK BOTH INSIDE THE OFFICE AND EXTERNALLY AS AS OMBUDSMAN
POD1000000013_S0000081	WELL WE YOU KNOW I HAVE A WORKFORCE WHO BELIEVE TOTALLY MY STAFF TOTALLY BELIEVE IN FAIRNESS AND EQUALITY
POD1000000013_S0000082	AND IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO COMPLAINS TO THE OFFICE THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO COMPLAINS OR WHAT THE NATURE OF THE COMPLAINT IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH IT
POD1000000013_S0000083	BUT I SUPPOSE WHERE THE AREA WHERE WHICH IS MOST CHALLENGING IS IN MY ROLE AS LOCAL GOVERNMENT STANDARDS COMMISSIONER WHERE I MYSELF HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF SECTARIANISM
POD1000000013_S0000084	BECAUSE YOU KNOW I WAS ADJUDICATING ON A PARTICULAR COUNSELLOR FROM A PARTICULAR PART OF THE THE UNIONIST COMMUNITY
POD1000000013_S0000085	SO THERE IS THAT ADDED LAYER OF NOT ONLY WANTING TO DO THINGS RIGHT TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION BUT BEING AWARE THAT NO MATTER WHAT THAT DECISION IS IT MIGHT PLEASE ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER
POD1000000013_S0000086	SO TO BE ACCUSED OF SECTARIANISM WAS A HUGE HURT FOR ME BECAUSE THAT'S NOT IT'S NOT PART OF MY VALUES OR MY STAFF VALUES
POD1000000013_S0000087	I MEAN THAT'S A BIG ISSUE BECAUSE IT AFFECTS YOU PERSONALLY
POD1000000013_S0000088	HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE A VERY RESILIENT TOUGH PERSON BUT EVEN THAT MUST BE HARD TO DEAL WITH
POD1000000013_S0000089	WELL FIRST OF ALL I'VE GOT HUGE SUPPORT FROM MY DEPUTY AND THE SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM WHO REASSURED ME THAT OF COURSE THIS ISN'T TRUE AND YOU KNOW IT ISN'T TRUE AND WE KNOW IT ISN'T TRUE
POD1000000013_S0000090	BUT I THINK WHAT WAS DIFFICULT WAS THE IMPACT ON MY FAMILY AND HOW THEY FELT
POD1000000013_S0000091	MY HUSBAND WAS ANGRY AND AND MY CHILDREN WERE UNHAPPY ABOUT IT
POD1000000013_S0000092	HOW DID IT AFFECT ME I LEARNED TO DEAL WITH I LEARNED THAT YOU CAN DEAL WITH THIS SORT OF CRITICISM
POD1000000013_S0000093	AND I LEARNED THAT BEHIND IT ALL YOU'VE GOT TO BE SURE THAT YOU'RE DOING YOU'RE MAKING THE RIGHT DECISION
POD1000000013_S0000094	I CAN REMEMBER A FEW WEEKS AGO WHEN I WAS SAVAGELY CRITICIZED ON TWITTER
POD1000000013_S0000095	AND I WAS THIRSTING TO REPLY AND MY OLDER SON SAID TO ME LEAVE IT ALONE DAD THEY WANT YOU TO REPLY
POD1000000013_S0000096	AND I THINK THAT WAS QUITE WISE ADVICE
POD1000000013_S0000097	SO YOU DO NEED TO CONSULT WITH PEOPLE ON PERSONAL ISSUES DON'T YOU
POD1000000013_S0000098	I THINK YOU DO NEED TO CONSULT
POD1000000013_S0000099	WHAT WHAT'S BEEN HELPFUL HAS BEEN PART OF THE OMBUDSMAN COMMUNITY'S RESPONSE TO THIS IS AND THE PERSONAL SUPPORT YOU'VE GIVEN ME ROB I WAS ABLE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT
POD1000000013_S0000100	I WAS ABLE TO TALK TO OTHERS LIKE THE CURRENT POLICE OMBUDSMAN FOR NORTHERN IRELAND WHO SAID LEAVE IT ALONE
POD1000000013_S0000101	JUST LEAVE IT BECAUSE IF YOU DO ANYTHING IF YOU TAKE ANY LEGAL ACTION THEN IT'S MERELY GOING TO PROVIDE MORE OXYGEN
POD1000000013_S0000102	
POD1000000013_S0000103	DOESN'T STOP IT BEING DIFFICULT
POD1000000013_S0000104	
POD1000000013_S0000105	PERSONALLY DIFFICULT AND THAT'S WHERE THE RESILIENCE COMES IN
POD1000000013_S0000106	THAT'S WHERE YOU'VE GOT TO GET UP THE NEXT MORNING GO INTO WORK AND YOUR STAFF HAVE GOT TO SEE THAT ALL MIGHT AFFECT YOU INSIDE
POD1000000013_S0000107	THAT YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO LEAD THE OFFICE AND DO THE JOB
POD1000000013_S0000108	THANK YOU THAT'S IMPORTANT
POD1000000013_S0000109	LET'S JUST MOVE THAT ON A LITTLE BIT AND TALK ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES IN RELATION TO THE ACTIONS OF PUBLIC SERVICES
POD1000000013_S0000110	YOU LAUNCHED A BRILLIANT HUMAN RIGHTS MANUAL WHICH SETS OUT AN APPROACH THAT MANY OMBUDSMAN IN EUROPE TAKE
POD1000000013_S0000111	IS NOT PARTICULARLY PREVALENT IN THE UNITED KINGDOM ABOUT ACTIONS THAT CAN BE TAKEN BY AN OMBUDSMAN
POD1000000013_S0000112	YOU TELL US A BIT MORE ABOUT HOW YOU CREATED THIS
POD1000000013_S0000113	WELL IT WAS CREATED JOINTLY WITH THE NORTHERN IRELAND HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION AND IT STARTED AS EVER AS AS ALL GOOD IDEAS WITH A CONVERSATION
POD1000000013_S0000114	AND IT WAS A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION AND OUR OFFICE AROUND THE SORT OF CASEWORK THAT WE WERE DEALING WITH
POD1000000013_S0000115	WE WERE DEALING WITH ISSUES LIKE THE ROMA COMMUNITY FEELING DISCRIMINATED BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH SERVICES
POD1000000013_S0000116	WE'RE DEALING WITH ISSUES OF CONSENT PATIENTS NOT GIVING CONSENT TO INTERVENTIONS AND THE FAMILY AND THE PATIENT FEELING EXCLUDED FROM THE DECISION MAKING
POD1000000013_S0000117	BUT ALSO WE REALIZE THAT OMBUDSMEN AND HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION AND EQUALITY BODIES ARE ACTUALLY DOING THE SAME JOB
POD1000000013_S0000118	SO WE MEAN MY MY STYLE IS TO MOVE ON FROM THE CONVERSATION AND ACTUALLY HAVE A PRODUCT
POD1000000013_S0000119	AND THE PRODUCT WAS HOW TO DO THIS MANUAL FOR OMBUDSMAN STAFF
POD1000000013_S0000120	HOW TO INTRODUCE HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLES INTO OMBUDSMAN INVESTIGATION
POD1000000013_S0000121	AND IT'S QUITE SIMPLE AND IT'S NOT ABOUT STRASBURG JURISPRUDENCE
POD1000000013_S0000122	THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF IT I THINK FOR NON LAWYERS YOU KNOW FOR FOR NON LEGAL STAFF THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE VERY SIMPLE PRINCIPLES
POD1000000013_S0000123	PARTICIPATION A PERSON AFFECTED BY A DECISION BY WHATEVER PUBLIC SERVICE PROVIDER BE IT HEALTH BE IT HOUSING BE IT YOU KNOW LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE
POD1000000013_S0000124	THEY HAVE TO BE GIVEN ENOUGH INFORMATION TO PARTICIPATE EFFECTIVELY IN THE DECISION MAKING
POD1000000013_S0000125	SO THERE'S THE PRINCIPLE OF EMPOWERMENT GIVING INFORMATION
POD1000000013_S0000126	THERE'S THE PRINCIPLE OF NONDISCRIMINATION AND BEING TREATED TREATED EQUALLY AND FAIRLY AND HAVING EQUAL ACCESS
POD1000000013_S0000127	AND ULTIMATELY THE FOURTH PRINCIPLE OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS BASED APPROACH IS ACCOUNTABILITY AND THAT'S WHAT WE OMBUDSMAN DO
POD1000000013_S0000128	WE HOLD PUBLIC SERVICES TO ACCOUNT
POD1000000013_S0000129	AND WOULD YOU SAY THAT YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO HOLD PUBLIC SERVICES MORE TO ACCOUNT AS A RESULT OF HAVING THAT HUMAN RIGHTS BASED APPROACH
POD1000000013_S0000130	YES I THINK MALADMINISTRATION IS A TOOL
POD1000000013_S0000131	BUT I THINK THAT HAVING A HUMAN RIGHTS LENS ALLOWS YOU TO LOOK MORE CLOSELY AT AWAY SO MUCH FROM THE PROCESS AS TO HOW THE PROCESS ACTUALLY AFFECTS THE INDIVIDUALS AND AFFECTS THE INDIVIDUAL'S RIGHTS
POD1000000013_S0000132	TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE WE HAD A CASE WHERE A YOUNG MAN DIED AS A RESULT OF A ROUTINE EAR OPERATION
POD1000000013_S0000133	AND IT WAS A ONE IN A MILLION REACTION TO A TITANIUM IMPLANT THE PACKING AROUND TITANIUM IMPLANT
POD1000000013_S0000134	POINT BEING HIS HIS MOM AND DAD BELIEVED THAT HE WASN'T CONSENTED FOR THAT INTERVENTION
POD1000000013_S0000135	THE AND AND THAT THAT WAS UNFAIR AND AFFECTED AS HUMAN RIGHTS
POD1000000013_S0000136	THE CORONER HAD REFUSED TO UNDERTAKE AN INQUEST SAYING IT DIDN'T AFFECT HIS HUMAN RIGHTS
POD1000000013_S0000137	WHEN IT CAME TO MY OFFICE WE IDENTIFIED THE HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLE OF PARTICIPATION
POD1000000013_S0000138	IF I KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME IF I'M TOLD OF THE RISKS INSTEAD OF SOMEONE ELSE MAKING THE DECISION FOR ME THEN MY HUMAN RIGHTS HAVE BEEN RESPECTED
POD1000000013_S0000139	WHEN I DREW THAT OUT IN THE INVESTIGATION REPORT I WAS ABLE TO COME TO A CONCLUSION THAT WHERE THERE WAS THERE WAS A CONFLICT BETWEEN THE EXPERTS
POD1000000013_S0000140	SOME SAID WELL ANOTHER CONSULTANT MIGHT NOT HAVE DONE THE IMPLANT ANOTHER SAID THEY WOULD HAVE THEY WOULD HAVE THEY WOULD HAVE GONE AHEAD WITH THE IMPLANT
POD1000000013_S0000141	BUT ACTUALLY THE HUMAN RIGHTS BASED APPROACH MEANT THAT I THOUGHT ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL THAT THEY HADN'T BEEN PROPERLY CONSENTED
POD1000000013_S0000142	THE RESULT NOT ONLY DID THE FAMILY GET AN INVESTIGATION REPORT IDENTIFYING THIS ISSUE BUT THEY WERE ABLE TO GO TO THE CORONER
POD1000000013_S0000143	HE'S COMMENCED AN INQUEST
POD1000000013_S0000144	NOW YOU HAVE TWO THINGS IN NORTHERN IRELAND THAT WE DON'T HAVE YOU HAVE A
POD1000000013_S0000145	PARTLY BECAUSE OF YOUR OWN EXCELLENCE IN BRINGING IT ABOUT YOU HAVE AN INTEGRATED PUBLIC SERVICE OMBUDSMAN SCHEME AND YOU HAVE THE POWER OF OWN INITIATIVE
POD1000000013_S0000146	ARE THESE VALUABLE ADDITIONS TO THE WAY OMBUDSMAN SHOULD BE WORKING
POD1000000013_S0000147	I DO BELIEVE IN THE ONE STOP SHOP MODEL
POD1000000013_S0000148	THE PUBLIC SERVICES OMBUDSMAN IN NORTHERN IRELAND LOOKS AT COMPLAINTS ABOUT GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS STATUTORY AGENCIES LOCAL GOVERNMENT HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE EDUCATION SCHOOLS UNIVERSITIES COLLEGES
POD1000000013_S0000149	I THINK THAT CAN BE CHALLENGING FOR STAFF BUT I BELIEVE THAT THEY ENJOY THE VARIETY
POD1000000013_S0000150	BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT AN OMBUDSMAN OMBUDSMAN PRINCIPLES OF GOOD ADMINISTRATION APPLY ACROSS SECTORS
POD1000000013_S0000151	SO YES I THINK IT IS OF VALUE
POD1000000013_S0000152	I THINK HAVING ONE PLACE TO GO TO TO SEEK REDRESS FOR INJUSTICE IS IS IMPORTANT
POD1000000013_S0000153	IF PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO GO TO COURT THERE'S AN OMBUDSMAN THERE THAT CAN LOOK AT THE FULL RANGE
POD1000000013_S0000154	OWN INITIATIVE IS FOR ME AN ESSENTIAL TOOL OF EVERY OMBUDSMAN'S TOOLKIT
POD1000000013_S0000155	WHEN YOU LOOK INTERNATIONALLY
POD1000000013_S0000156	YOU LOOK AT OMBUDSMAN IN AUSTRALIA YOU LOOK AT OMBUDSMAN IN EUROPE YOU LOOK AT OMBUDSMAN IN NORTH AMERICA THE ONTARIO OMBUDSMAN THE WEST WESTERN AUSTRALIAN OMBUDSMAN
POD1000000013_S0000157	THEY ALL HAVE OWN INITIATIVE THEY'VE ALL HAD OWN INITIATIVE FROM THE START
POD1000000013_S0000158	THE IRISH OMBUDSMAN ACT THAT WAS CREATED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY HAD OWN INITIATIVE THERE AS WELL AS DEALING WITH INDIVIDUAL COMPLAINTS
POD1000000013_S0000159	FOR ME AN OMBUDSMAN WITHOUT OWN INITIATIVE CAN'T FULFILL THE MANDATE OF IMPROVING PUBLIC SERVICES FOR MANY NOT JUST THE INDIVIDUAL
POD1000000013_S0000160	SO YOU WOULD YOU'D HAVE NO HESITATION ABOUT INTRODUCING AN INITIATIVE IT'S ESSENTIAL
POD1000000013_S0000161	NOT AT ALL I WAS LUCKY TO BE PART OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE OMBUDSMAN ACT
POD1000000013_S0000162	AND WAS KEY TO HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO PERSUADE OFFICIALS WHO WERE PERHAPS NERVOUS ABOUT THE OMBUDSMAN HAVING OWN INITIATIVE POWERS
POD1000000013_S0000163	THAT REALLY THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY COULD BENEFIT PUBLIC SERVICES IN THE END
POD1000000013_S0000164	IT IS ABOUT PREVENTION
POD1000000013_S0000165	YOU CAN DEAL WITH NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS BUT NEVER GET TO THE CORE ISSUE WHEREAS OWN INITIATIVE ALLOWS YOU TO TACKLE THE CORE ISSUE OF SYSTEMIC FAILING
POD1000000013_S0000166	WELL I AGREE WITH THAT
POD1000000013_S0000167	AND THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S NECESSARY FOR US TO HAVE THE REFORM THAT YOU'VE ALREADY BEEN OPERATING FOR NEARLY THREE YEARS
POD1000000013_S0000168	YES AND NOW THE WELSH OMBUDSMAN IS ABOUT TO GET THAT ALSO
POD1000000013_S0000169	I BELIEVE SCOTTISH OMBUDSMAN WOULD LIKE OWN INITIATIVE
POD1000000013_S0000170	SO IF THAT HAPPENS IT MEANS THAT THE DEVOLVED ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE IT
POD1000000013_S0000171	AND THE FIRST EVER OMBUDSMAN IN THESE ISLANDS THE PARLIAMENTARY OMBUDSMAN HAS NOT
POD1000000013_S0000172	AND I THINK THAT'S MISSING AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE PUBLIC SERVICES FOR THE CITIZEN
POD1000000013_S0000173	AS YOU MOVE ON FROM THE PUBLIC SERVICE OMBUDSMAN WHAT WHAT ARE YOU MOST PROUD OF
POD1000000013_S0000174	IS IT BRINGING THE WHOLE THING TOGETHER THE INTEGRATION OF THE VARIOUS SYSTEMS
POD1000000013_S0000175	I THINK THE LEGISLATION THAT ALLOWED THE PUBLIC SERVICES OMBUDSMAN AS A ONE STOP SHOP FOR COMPLAINTS ABOUT PUBLIC SERVICES
POD1000000013_S0000176	BUT ALSO BEING ABLE TO BRING IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT STANDARDS
POD1000000013_S0000177	BECAUSE NORTHERN IRELAND WAS ONE THAT WAS THE ONLY PARTY IN EUROPE DIDN'T HAVE A MANDATORY CODE OF CONDUCT FOR LOCAL REPRESENTATIVES
POD1000000013_S0000178	THAT WAS INTRODUCED IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN
POD1000000013_S0000179	AND MY OFFICE AND MYSELF AND AND AS DEPUTY OMBUDSMAN NOW OMBUDSMAN HAVE BEEN KEY TO ESTABLISHING AN INVESTIGATIVE ADJUDICATIVE FUNCTION IN NORTHERN IRELAND
POD1000000013_S0000180	THAT THAT IS A UNIQUE MODEL BUT I BELIEVE OPERATES VERY WELL
POD1000000013_S0000181	THAT IS NOT WORK THAT IS OUT WITH OMBUDSMAN
POD1000000013_S0000182	BECAUSE FOR ME ETHICAL STANDARDS VALUES FAIRNESS THEY'RE ALL PART OF GOOD GOVERNANCE AND THAT THAT'S WHERE WE OMBUDSMEN ARE
POD1000000013_S0000183	I MEAN WE'RE NOT A COURT WE DON'T DECLARE DON'T MAKE BINDING DECISIONS
POD1000000013_S0000184	BUT NEVERTHELESS WE CAN INFLUENCE WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MAKE AND WITH SETTING STANDARDS
POD1000000013_S0000186	WE ASKED COLLEAGUES ON TWITTER TO SEND IN QUESTIONS
POD1000000013_S0000187	AND WE HAD A SET OF QUESTIONS FROM ONE DISSATISFIED USER OF THE SERVICE UNDER YOUR PREDECESSOR WHO FELT THAT SHE HADN'T BEEN TREATED FAIRLY BY THE SYSTEM
POD1000000013_S0000188	WHAT CAN YOU SAY TO PEOPLE IN THAT POSITION
POD1000000013_S0000189	I THINK THAT MANY PEOPLE MISUNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF THE OMBUDSMAN
POD1000000013_S0000190	THEY BELIEVE THAT THE OMBUDSMAN IS THERE PARTICULARLY TO ADVOCATE FOR THEM AND THEIR PARTICULAR ISSUE
POD1000000013_S0000191	OMBUDSMEN ARE IMPARTIAL SO IF THEY'RE FINDING OF NO FAILURE CAN BE DISAPPOINTING TO A COMPLAINANT
POD1000000013_S0000192	AND I BELIEVE THAT WAS THE CASE IN RELATION TO THE PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL THAT YOU REFERRED TO
POD1000000013_S0000193	THE PREVIOUS OMBUDSMAN DID NOT FIND IN HER FAVOR AND THAT CAN BE DISAPPOINTING
POD1000000013_S0000194	BUT THEN YOU'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT IS THAT PERHAPS A CLINICIAN OR A MEMBER OF HEALTH STAFF WHO HAS BEEN CRITICIZED RECEIVES YOU KNOW A MESSAGE THAT ACTUALLY THEY DID IT RIGHT
POD1000000013_S0000195	BUT THERE ARE MANY OCCASIONS IN WHICH COMPLAINANTS DON'T AGREE WITH MY DECISIONS
POD1000000013_S0000197	BUT I STILL HAVE TO DECIDE FAIRLY ENSURE THERE'S A FAIR PROCESS ENSURE EVERYONE GETS AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT AND AND AND REPORT ON THE MATTER
POD1000000013_S0000198	THAT'S WHAT AN OMBUDSMAN DOES
POD1000000013_S0000199	YEAH IT'S DIFFICULT SOMETIMES TO EXPLAIN THAT WHILE THE COMPLAINT BELONGS TO THE COMPLAINANT THE DECISION BELONGS TO THE OMBUDSMAN PROVIDING IT'S EVIDENCE BASED AND RIGOROUS
POD1000000013_S0000200	PROVIDED IT'S EVIDENCE EVIDENCE BASED AND RIGOROUS BUT ALSO I BELIEVE FAIR
POD1000000013_S0000201	YOU HAVE TO GIVE EVERYONE AN OPPORTUNITY INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE CRITICIZED
POD1000000013_S0000202	BUT THIS ISSUE ABOUT IT'S AN OMBUDSMAN DECISION WHEN YOU BRING YOUR COMPLAINT
POD1000000013_S0000203	IT IS THE OMBUDSMAN'S DECISION HAS ACTUALLY BEEN WRITTEN INTO THE LEGISLATION THAT I REFER TO
POD1000000013_S0000204	WHICH IS THAT UNDER THE NORTHERN IRISH OMBUDSMAN LEGISLATION THE TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN ACT THAT I MENTIONED THAT EVEN IF A COMPLAINANT WITHDREW THEIR COMPLAINT I CAN STILL INVESTIGATE
POD1000000013_S0000205	SO IT IS THE OMBUDSMAN'S INVESTIGATION
POD1000000013_S0000206	NOW YOU YOU'VE BEEN WITH THE OFFICE IN NORTHERN IRELAND FOR TEN YEARS
POD1000000013_S0000207	A LONG TIME WILL YOU HAVE ANY REGRETS ABOUT
POD1000000013_S0000208	MOVING ON EVEN THOUGH IT'S AN EVEN MORE DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING ROLE
POD1000000013_S0000209	I HAVE HUGE I HAVE HUGE REGRETS ABOUT LEAVING MY STAFF BECAUSE THEY ARE THEY ARE WONDERFUL TO WORK WITH HUGELY SUPPORTIVE
POD1000000013_S0000210	AND ON DAYS WHEN I DON'T HAVE MY USUAL LEVEL OF ENERGY THEY GIVE ME THE ENERGY BACK TO KEEP GOING
POD1000000013_S0000211	SO I HAVE REGRETS ABOUT LEAVING MY STAFF
POD1000000013_S0000212	BUT I MEAN I WAS ASKED THIS QUESTION ABOUT WHY DO YOU WANT TO UNDERTAKE THE ROLE OF POLICE OMBUDSMAN
POD1000000013_S0000213	I DO BELIEVE THAT IT'S ABOUT PUBLIC SERVICE AND IT'S ABOUT BRINGING MY EXPERIENCE
POD1000000013_S0000214	SAID TEN YEARS EXPERIENCE IN THE OMBUDSMAN'S OFFICE FIVE YEARS EXPERIENCE IN THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE
POD1000000013_S0000215	IT'S BRINGING BRINGING THAT TO BEAR IN WHAT IS YOU KNOW A VERY CHALLENGING AREA DEALING WITH POLICE COMPLAINTS IN NORTHERN IRELAND
POD1000000013_S0000216	NOW YOU'VE SPENT THE DAY WITH US SPEAKING TO MY COLLEAGUES AT OUR ALL STAFF AWAY DAY
POD1000000013_S0000217	WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE TO OUR YOUNGER COLLEAGUES MANY OF WHOM HAVE ONLY RECENTLY JOINED THE OMBUDS PROFESSION
POD1000000013_S0000218	THE ADVICE I WOULD GIVE IS FIRST OF ALL IT IS A PROFESSION
POD1000000013_S0000219	AS YOU KNOW ROB FROM YOUR DISCUSSIONS WITH ME I BELIEVE VERY MUCH THAT THAT IT HAS TO BE RECOGNIZED AS A PROFESSION
POD1000000013_S0000220	AND THAT I'M AMAZED AT YOUR ACCREDITATION PROJECT AT GETTING THAT OFF THE GROUND
POD1000000013_S0000221	I WOULD ADVISE THE YOUNG PEOPLE IN THIS OFFICE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT
POD1000000013_S0000222	THAT IS A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY AND I REALIZED THE RIGOR AND THE COMMITMENT TO ACHIEVING THAT ACCREDITATION BUT I WOULD SAY GO FOR IT
POD1000000013_S0000223	I MEAN THAT THAT IN THIS YOU ARE LEADING THE WAY IN OMBUDSMAN IN THE OMBUDSMAN WORLD
POD1000000013_S0000224	IT IS SOMETHING THAT MANY HAVE TALKED ABOUT I'VE TALKED ABOUT IT MYSELF
POD1000000013_S0000225	I'VE TRIED TO DO IT BUT YOU AND AMANDA HAVE ACTUALLY DONE IT AND I THINK THAT IS AMAZING
POD1000000013_S0000226	SO MY ADVICE IS TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY
POD1000000013_S0000227	MARIE ANDERSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH

POD1000000015_S0000010	I HAVE FOUR YOUNGER BROTHERS SO I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT ISSUES ABOUT EQUALITY WERE PROBABLY IN THERE BEFORE I EVEN KNEW THE WORD
POD1000000015_S0000011	BUT MY MY FAMILY A MILITARY FAMILY SO TRAVELED AROUND AS A CHILD
POD1000000015_S0000012	AND MOSTLY I'D SAY WHAT I GOT FROM THEM WAS A REAL STRONG MORAL COMPASS
POD1000000015_S0000013	NOT DRILLED INTO ME MUST DO THIS MUSTN'T DO THAT BUT ABOUT TREATING PEOPLE WITH RESPECT PARTICULARLY WHEN WE WERE TRAVELING TO NEW PLACES AND MEETING NEW PEOPLE FOR THE FIRST TIME
POD1000000015_S0000014	AND I THINK THAT THAT MORAL AND ETHICAL BACKGROUND NOT CALLED THAT
POD1000000015_S0000015	IT WAS JUST TRY AND BE A GOOD PERSON TELL THE TRUTH DO YOUR HOMEWORK ON TIME ALL THESE SORTS OF THINGS PROBABLY INSTILLED IN ME A STRONG WORK ETHIC
POD1000000015_S0000016	BUT IT ALSO INSTILLED IN ME A VERY DEEP LEVEL OF CARING FOR PEOPLE
POD1000000015_S0000017	
POD1000000015_S0000018	BECAUSE I WAS ABLE TO SEE OVER THE WHOLE OF MY LIFE STILL AM A WHOLE RANGE OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIFFERENT STARTS IN LIFE DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES
POD1000000015_S0000019	AND I THINK WITHIN THAT I'VE DEVELOPED MY OWN SENSE OF JUSTICE
POD1000000015_S0000020	AND I'M HUGELY GRATEFUL TO MY PARENTS THEY'RE LOVELY PEOPLE

POD1000000015_S0000025	I WENT TO A LOT OF SCHOOLS SO YOU HAD TO LEARN TO MAKE FRIENDS QUICKLY AND YOU COULDN'T HAVE A LONG LEAD IN TIME IF YOU LIKE
POD1000000015_S0000026	BECAUSE I LIVED A LOT OF TIME IN MILITARY ACCOMMODATION THAT WAS LIKE A BIG FAMILY OF ITSELF BECAUSE YOU TENDED TO BE WITH PEOPLE WHO WERE IN A SIMILAR SITUATION
POD1000000015_S0000027	BUT MOSTLY I SUPPOSE I JUST SAW IT AS A BIG SENSE OF ADVENTURE
POD1000000015_S0000028	IT DOESN'T SUIT ALL BUT FOR ME IT WAS GREAT BECAUSE I JUST MOVED AROUND HAD A WHOLE WEALTH OF EXPERIENCE WHICH I DON'T THINK I'D HAVE GOT IN ANY OTHER WAY

POD1000000015_S0000030	WELL MY MAIN CLAIM TO FAME I THINK SITTING HERE IN MANCHESTER IS THE THING THAT I'M PROBABLY MOST PLEASED WITH IS MY MBA FROM MANCHESTER BUSINESS SCHOOL
POD1000000015_S0000031	I ALSO HAVE A TEACHING QUALIFICATION
POD1000000015_S0000032	BUT I THINK THE MBA BECAUSE I WENT BACK TO THAT AFTER I'D BEEN WORKING A WHILE WAS PROBABLY THE MOST ENLIGHTENING PART OF MY EDUCATION
POD1000000015_S0000033	BECAUSE AGAIN I LEARNED A LOT ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS BUT WHAT IT GAVE ME BECAUSE I HAD THE WAS ABLE TO REFLECT ON WORKING BACKGROUND AS WELL
POD1000000015_S0000034	WHAT IT GAVE ME WAS A SENSE OF HOW TO ASK QUESTIONS AND CHALLENGE IN A WAY PERHAPS I HADN'T DONE BEFORE THAT

POD1000000015_S0000039	BECAUSE I WAS VERY DELIBERATE IN NOT ALWAYS GOING DOWN PUBLIC SECTOR ROUTES FOR STUDY OR PUBLIC SECTOR MODULES BECAUSE I WANTED TO LEARN MORE ABOUT DIFFERENT SORTS OF THINKING

POD1000000015_S0000044	CAN OWN UP TO THAT
POD1000000015_S0000045	IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT
POD1000000015_S0000046	I WENT TO WORK I WAS WORKING IN CHINA LECTURING IN BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS AND I NEEDED A JOB WHEN I GOT BACK
POD1000000015_S0000047	SO I THOUGHT OH THEY'RE ADVERTISING FOR INVESTIGATORS AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT OMBUDSMAN THAT'LL DO FOR AWHILE IT'LL PAY THE MORTGAGE UNTIL I GET SOMETHING ELSE
POD1000000015_S0000048	AND I'VE PRETTY MUCH NEVER LEFT OMBUDSMAN OR INFORMATION COMMISSIONING SINCE
POD1000000015_S0000049	AND I THINK WHAT IT WAS WAS I FOUND A JOB THAT I ENJOYED IT WAS CHALLENGING BUT ACTUALLY FITTED IN WITH MY VALUE SYSTEM
POD1000000015_S0000050	RIGHT AND YOU'VE HAD A VERY DISTINGUISHED AND VARIED CAREER YOU WERE THE SCOTTISH INFORMATION
POD1000000015_S0000051	WHAT WHAT WAS THE HIGHLIGHT OF THAT BEFORE YOU CAME TO THE SCOTTISH PUBLIC SERVICE OMBUDSMAN
POD1000000015_S0000052	I THINK IT'S HARD TO SAY WHAT HIGHLIGHT IS IN TERMS OF BEING THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER
POD1000000015_S0000053	THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT I DID THAT I WAS REALLY PROUD OF IN A GOOD WAY
POD1000000015_S0000054	ONE OF THEM WAS IT SOUNDS VERY TRIVIAL BUT WE ESTABLISHED A PORTAL FOR THE UPLOADING OF FREEDOM OF INFORMATION STATISTICS FROM PUBLIC BODIES IN SCOTLAND
POD1000000015_S0000055	AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS NOW THERE IS A THREE OR FOUR YEAR DATABASE OF THE NUMBER OF FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUESTS AND THE OUTCOME OF THEM FOR THE WHOLE OF SCOTLAND
POD1000000015_S0000056	THAT WE CAN LOOK AT TRENDS WE CAN LOOK AT DEVELOPMENTS
POD1000000015_S0000057	AND THAT ACTUALLY FOR ME WAS A HIGHLIGHT BECAUSE I DIDN'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE ENFORCEMENT POWER TO DO IT
POD1000000015_S0000058	IT WAS DONE THROUGH COOPERATION AND CO WORKING WITH PUBLIC BODIES
POD1000000015_S0000059	THE OTHER COUPLE OF THINGS THAT REALLY STUCK IN MY MIND WAS VERY VERY EARLY ON A PARTICULAR DECISION I MADE
POD1000000015_S0000060	WHICH WAS ENFORCING TELLING THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT THEY HAD TO DISCLOSE WHETHER THEY HAD TAKEN LEGAL ADVICE ABOUT SCOTLAND'S POSITION WITH EUROPE
POD1000000015_S0000061	SHOULD THEY GAIN INDEPENDENCE BECAUSE IT WAS THE TIME OF THE INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM
POD1000000015_S0000062	
POD1000000015_S0000063	AND WHY THAT'S PARTICULARLY INTERESTING IS IT WAS A VERY BIG ISSUE I THINK IN THE INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM AND NOBODY I THINK COULD HAVE FORESEEN WHERE WE ARE NOW
POD1000000015_S0000064	THE FINAL ONE WHICH I THINK I'LL TALK ABOUT MORE WHEN WE TALK MAYBE ABOUT SOME OF THE OMBUDSMAN POWERS
POD1000000015_S0000065	WAS ABOUT A DIFFERENT WAY OF INTERVENING IN RELATION TO GOOD AND POOR PRACTICE WITH SCOTTISH PUBLIC BODIES
POD1000000015_S0000066	YOUR YOUR ENGLISH I THINK IS THAT CORRECT
POD1000000015_S0000067	
POD1000000015_S0000068	SO HAS THERE EVER BEEN AN ISSUE ABOUT YOU HOLDING PRESTIGIOUS AND IMPORTANT JOBS IN SCOTLAND
POD1000000015_S0000069	ABOUT AN ENGLISH PERSON HAVING THAT RESPONSIBILITY
POD1000000015_S0000070	NO I HAVE A SCOTTISH NAME AGNEW IS A SCOTTISH NAME AND I AM MARRIED TO SOMEBODY FROM SCOTTISH DESCENT
POD1000000015_S0000071	I WAS ONCE ASKED BY A JOURNALIST WAS I HAPPY THAT I HAD ADOPTED SCOTLAND AS MY HOME
POD1000000015_S0000072	AND I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THE ANSWER REFLECTED HOW I FELT WHICH WAS I'M ETERNALLY GRATEFUL THAT SCOTLAND HAS ADOPTED ME AS SOMEBODY WHO LIVES THERE AND DOES THESE THINGS WITHIN SCOTLAND
POD1000000015_S0000073	BUT NO IT'S IT'S A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE TO BEING IN ENGLAND BUT I'VE NEVER NOT TO MY FACE ANYWAY EVER HAD AN ISSUE WITH BEING ENGLISH
POD1000000015_S0000074	THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR
POD1000000015_S0000075	NOW CAN WE JUST TALK A BIT ABOUT THE SCOTTISH OMBUDSMAN WHICH YOU TOOK UP POST NEARLY THREE YEARS AGO
POD1000000015_S0000076	THE DEVOLVED OMBUDSMAN ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE UK OMBUDSMAN
POD1000000015_S0000077	BECAUSE THEY'RE MORE MODERN THEY'VE ADOPTED LEGISLATION TO MAKE THEM MORE RELEVANT TO DEVELOPING SITUATIONS AND YOU HAVE MORE POWERS THAN THE UK OMBUDSMAN HAS
POD1000000015_S0000078	WHAT'S IT LIKE BEING THE HEAD OF AN INTEGRATED PUBLIC SERVICE OMBUDSMAN IS THAT A GOOD THING
POD1000000015_S0000079	YES I THINK IT'S A VERY GOOD THING BECAUSE YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT SORT OF INSIGHT YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT SORT OF OVERVIEW AND SECTORS DO VARY
POD1000000015_S0000080	THERE IS VARIANCE BECAUSE THEY'RE WORKING TO DIFFERENT REGULATIONS IT MAKES YOUR JOB VERY VARIED ALSO
POD1000000015_S0000081	I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WITH IT THOUGH IS IF YOU WORK IN A SPECIFIC SECTOR
POD1000000015_S0000082	SO IF I REFLECT ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT OMBUDSMAN YOU BECAME MUCH MORE IMMERSED IN THE TECHNICALITIES OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT
POD1000000015_S0000083	WHEN YOU WORK ACROSS SECTORS WHAT WE FIND IS PARTICULARLY A PERSONAL REFLECTION IS I HAVE TO DO A BIT MORE DIGGING AROUND TO FIND OUT ABOUT HOW THE SECTORS OPERATE IN SCOTLAND
POD1000000015_S0000084	AND I ALSO RELY QUITE A LOT ON PROFESSIONAL ADVICE PARTICULARLY FOR HEALTH AND SOCIAL WORK
POD1000000015_S0000085	SO WE DON'T NECESSARILY DEVELOP THROUGH EXPERIENCE OF VOLUME OF CASES THE SAME EXPERIENCE THAT YOU DO WHEN YOU'RE PERHAPS LOOKING AT
POD1000000015_S0000086	ONE PARTICULAR AREA OF PUBLIC SERVICE
POD1000000015_S0000087	BUT THE OTHER THING THAT I THINK REFLECTS WITH MYSELF AND THE WELSH AND THE NORTHERN IRELAND OMBUDSMAN IS BECAUSE THE POPULATION OF THE COUNTRY IS SMALLER
POD1000000015_S0000088	AND THE COUNTRY ITSELF HAS A DIFFERENT SORT OF STRUCTURE TO IT
POD1000000015_S0000089	YOU OFTEN GET GIVEN THINGS TO DO THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT AN OMBUDSMAN TO BE DOING
POD1000000015_S0000090	SO AS WELL AS COMPLAINT HANDLING AND THE COMPLAINT STANDARDS WE ALSO HAVE DUTIES FOR WITH THE FINAL STAGE OF APPEAL FOR A BENEFIT SCOTTISH WELFARE FUND
POD1000000015_S0000091	AND THEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT NORTHERN IRELAND AND WALES THEY ALSO HAVE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE DIFFERENT
POD1000000015_S0000092	AND I THINK THAT IS AS MUCH A CHALLENGE AS ANYTHING BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST LIKE RUNNING TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS BUT TRYING TO HAVE AN INTEGRATED ORGANIZATION
POD1000000015_S0000093	OKAY YOU RELY ON PROFESSIONAL ADVICE BUT THERE MUST ALSO BE A CHALLENGE FOR YOUR CASE HANDLERS TO DEAL WITH THE THE WIDTH OF FUNCTIONS THAT THEY COME UP
POD1000000015_S0000094	YOU DIVIDED ACCORDING TO THE SECTORS OR DO PEOPLE
POD1000000015_S0000096	MULTITASKING TO DO
POD1000000015_S0000097	THEY HAVE MULTITASKING TO DO AND THEY ARE AN INCREDIBLE SET OF PEOPLE MY INVESTIGATORS
POD1000000015_S0000098	BUT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DRIVES US AND THAT IS PROBABLY THE THE UNITING THING IS VERY MUCH ABOUT VALUES
POD1000000015_S0000099	AND I THINK LIKE MOST OMBUDSMAN ORGANIZATIONS I'VE EVER COME ACROSS IT'S A FAIRLY UNIQUE WORKFORCE I WOULD SAY
POD1000000015_S0000100	BECAUSE YOU ASK ANYBODY WHY WE'RE THERE AND VERY RARELY WILL YOU DEVIATE FAR FROM BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE BECAUSE WE WANT TO SEE IMPROVEMENT BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE THINGS BETTER
POD1000000015_S0000101	SO YES IT'S A CHALLENGE HAVING THE SCOPE AND WE HAVE SOME INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY HAVE A BACKGROUND IN A PARTICULAR AREA BUT WE DON'T HAVE SPECIALISTS
POD1000000015_S0000102	OKAY NOW WHAT YOU HAVE WHICH WE DON'T HAVE IS THE STATUS OF BEING A COMPLAINT STANDARDS AUTHORITY
POD1000000015_S0000103	COULD YOU EXPLAIN TO OUR LISTENERS BRIEFLY WHAT THAT MEANS
POD1000000015_S0000104	BRIEFLY WHAT IT MEANS IS THE OMBUDSMAN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SETTING A MODEL COMPLAINTS HANDLING PROCESS THAT ALL SCOTTISH BODIES MUST FOLLOW
POD1000000015_S0000105	AND WE THEN WITH THAT HAVE A DUTY TO MONITOR PERFORMANCE IN RELATION TO COMPLAINT HANDLING AND COMBINED WITH SOME OF OUR OTHER POWERS DUTY TO ENFORCE GOOD PRACTICE TO REPORT ON IT
POD1000000015_S0000106	NOW THAT SOUNDS YOU KNOW OH THAT'S NICE MODEL COMPLAINTS HANDLING
POD1000000015_S0000107	BUT WHAT IT MEANS IN PRACTICE IS WITH SOME SLIGHT VARIATIONS BY SECTOR BECAUSE DIFFERENT SECTORS HAVE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT NEEDS
POD1000000015_S0000108	IT MEANS THAT ANYBODY MAKING A COMPLAINT TO A PUBLIC BODY IN SCOTLAND AND ABOUT A PUBLIC BODY IN SCOTLAND IS BASICALLY MAKING A COMPLAINT UNDER THE SAME SET OF STANDARDS
POD1000000015_S0000109	SO THE MODEL COMPLAINTS HANDLING PROCESS SAYS THAT THE FIRST STAGE OF A COMPLAINT YOU MUST TRY AND RESPOND WITHIN FIVE WORKING DAYS TO RESOLVE IT
POD1000000015_S0000110	VERY BIG FOCUS ON RESOLUTION
POD1000000015_S0000111	IF YOU CAN'T OR THE PERSON IS NOT SATISFIED YOU CAN THEN TAKE ANOTHER TWENTY WORKING DAYS TO LOOK AT IT IN MORE DETAIL
POD1000000015_S0000112	IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU THINK YOU NEED MORE THAN TWENTY DAYS FOR THEN TALK TO THE COMPLAINER ABOUT THAT
POD1000000015_S0000113	BUT IT ESSENTIALLY MEANS THAT IF SOMEBODY DOES NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE OR DOESN'T RECEIVE A RESPONSE IN TIME THEY GET TO THE OMBUDSMAN A LOT QUICKER THAN THEY MIGHT OTHERWISE DO
POD1000000015_S0000114	THE OTHER BENEFIT OF THE COMPLAINTS MODEL COMPLAINTS HANDLING PROCESS IS THAT THERE IS A VERY STRONG FOCUS ON LEARNING FROM COMPLAINTS
POD1000000015_S0000115	SO THE STANDARDS THAT GO WITH THIS WHICH INCIDENTALLY I HAVE TO LAY BEFORE THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT THE STANDARDS
POD1000000015_S0000116	THEY ALSO HAVE A VERY STRONG BENT ON LEARNING FROM COMPLAINTS
POD1000000015_S0000117	AND I THINK THAT'S AN AREA WHERE WE CAN PERHAPS DEVELOP MORE IN HOW WE HOLD PUBLIC BODIES TO ACCOUNT TO DEMONSTRATE THAT LEARNING
POD1000000015_S0000118	BECAUSE LIKE OUR COMPLAINTS THE MODEL COMPLAINTS HANDLING WE HAVE TO SHOW THAT THERE IS AN IMPACT AND THAT THERE IS VALUE TO INDIVIDUALS AND TO PUBLIC SERVICES AS A WHOLE
POD1000000015_S0000119	I THINK FOR ME THE THE MOST VALUABLE THING ABOUT IT THOUGH IS IT GIVES YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH PUBLIC BODIES NOT ALWAYS IN OPPOSITION TO THEM
POD1000000015_S0000120	WHICH WITH THE BEST WILL IN THE WORLD HOWEVER MUCH YOU TRY A RESOLUTION OR SORT OF DISCURSIVE WAY OF LOOKING AT COMPLAINTS
POD1000000015_S0000121	ONCE A COMPLAINT HAS REACHED THE OMBUDSMAN IT IS IN MANY WAYS ADVERSARIAL WHETHER YOU WANT IT TO BE OR NOT
POD1000000015_S0000122	BUT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT COMPLAINT HANDLING AS A WHOLE YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY ACTUALLY TO HELP PUBLIC BODIES
POD1000000015_S0000123	AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO GET BETTER AT COMPLAINT HANDLING WHICH YOU HOPE MEANS THEY GET BETTER AT LEARNING FROM COMPLAINTS
POD1000000015_S0000124	WHICH MEANS PEOPLE GET THE RIGHT SERVICE THE FIRST TIME
POD1000000015_S0000125	I DON'T THINK WE'LL EVER ELIMINATE COMPLAINTS BUT CERTAINLY IT HOPEFULLY WILL MAKE IT A MORE PRODUCTIVE EXPERIENCE
POD1000000015_S0000126	NOW I'M A FULL SUPPORTER OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING
POD1000000015_S0000127	I'M A BURGLAR OF YOUR PRACTICE WHEN I WAS THE HIGHER EDUCATION OMBUDSMAN I STOLE IT HOOK LINE AND SINKER TO USE IN ENGLISH UNIVERSITIES
POD1000000015_S0000128	THE IDEA THAT THEY COULD RESOLVE COMPLAINTS WITHIN FIVE DAYS WAS ANATHEMA TO THEM THEY WOULDN'T THEY WOULDN'T HAVE THAT WE ENDED UP WITH NINETY
POD1000000015_S0000129	BUT NEVERTHELESS THEY THEY DID IT
POD1000000015_S0000130	BUT THE DIFFERENCE AND THE THE RADICAL NATURE OF WHAT YOU DO IS EFFECTIVELY YOU ARE A REGULATOR NOW
POD1000000015_S0000131	WHEREAS OMBUDSMEN HAVE TRADITIONALLY ALWAYS SAID WE RELY ON OUR MORAL AUTHORITY NOT ON A COERCIVE POWER
POD1000000015_S0000132	HAS THAT MADE A DIFFERENCE OR IS IT JUST WORDS
POD1000000015_S0000133	NO I DON'T THINK IT MAKES ITS MADE A DIFFERENCE YET
POD1000000015_S0000134	I ALSO THINK I SHOULD ADD THAT I WAS AN OMBUDSMAN WHEN THE COMPLAINT STANDARD AUTHORITY CAME IN
POD1000000015_S0000135	
POD1000000015_S0000136	AND CREDIT HAS TO GO TO JIM MARTIN MY PREDECESSOR FOR DRIVING THIS
POD1000000015_S0000137	
POD1000000015_S0000138	WHAT HE'S LEFT ME AS A LEGACY IS SOMETHING REALLY GOOD TO DEVELOP AND WORK WITH WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW
POD1000000015_S0000139	HAVING BEEN INFORMATION COMMISSIONER WHICH REALLY IS A REGULATORY FUNCTION YOUR DECISION IS BINDING OR YOU GO TO COURT
POD1000000015_S0000140	I THINK THE CONCEPT OF REGULATION PROBABLY HASN'T CREPT INTO OUR THINKING WITH COMPLAINTS STANDARDS IN QUITE THE SAME WAY
POD1000000015_S0000141	BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DEVELOPING BUT MAYBE NOT CALLING IT REGULATION IN THE SAME WAY
POD1000000015_S0000142	BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WOULD SAY LEARNING FROM HINDSIGHT IS THAT WE TOOK A VERY STRUCTURED APPROACH OF ROLLING IT OUT SECTOR BY SECTOR THIS MODEL COMPLAINTS HANDLING
POD1000000015_S0000143	AND WHAT THAT MEANT WAS IT WAS A NUMBER OF YEARS BEFORE EVERY PUBLIC BODY IN SCOTLAND WAS FOLLOWING
POD1000000015_S0000144	THE NHS WAS THE LAST AND THAT'S BEEN THE LAST I THINK JUST COMING TO THE END OF THEIR SECOND YEAR
POD1000000015_S0000145	IF YOU COMPARE THAT TO THE FIRST WHICH WAS LOCAL GOVERNMENT
POD1000000015_S0000146	LOCAL GOVERNMENT NOW A REALLY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF COMPLAINTS GET RESPONDED TO IN THE FIRST INSTANCE IN THE FIVE WORKING DAYS
POD1000000015_S0000147	I THINK FROM MEMORY IT'S IT'S OVER EIGHTY PERCENT AND THAT'S REALLY SIGNIFICANT FOR COMPLAINERS
POD1000000015_S0000148	NOW WHAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS AND WE WENT LIVE WITH IN APRIL IS WHAT WE'VE CALLED OUR SUPPORT AND INTERVENTION POLICY
POD1000000015_S0000149	AND THIS IS A CONCEPT THAT I BROUGHT WITH ME FROM BEING INFORMATION COMMISSIONER
POD1000000015_S0000150	AND BASICALLY WAS LOOKING AT ALL THE POWERS THAT YOU HAVE AS AN OMBUDSMAN BECAUSE THE REAL VALUE COMES IN THE COMBINATION OF THEM NOT JUST THE INDIVIDUAL BITS
POD1000000015_S0000151	SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE POWERS TO SET COMPLAINT HANDLING PROCESSES TO TAKE ACTION IF COMPLAINT HANDLING FALLS SHORT YOU THEN LOOK AT OTHER THINGS LIKE YOUR INFORMATION GATHERING POWERS
POD1000000015_S0000152	WE'VE CREATED A FRAMEWORK WHICH SETS OUT WHAT OUR POWERS ARE AND WITHIN THAT WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO TO EITHER SUPPORT OR IF NECESSARY INTERVENE
POD1000000015_S0000153	BECAUSE WHEN WE FOR EXAMPLE A SIMPLE EXAMPLE WE MIGHT SEE A NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS FROM A PUBLIC BODY WHERE THE FINAL RESPONSE THAT THEY GIVE TO THE COMPLAINER DOES NOT SIGNPOST THE OMBUDSMAN
POD1000000015_S0000154	THEY HAVE A DUTY TO DO THAT UNDER THE COMPLAINTS HANDLING PROCESS
POD1000000015_S0000155	SO WE ARE GETTING BETTER AT OUR OWN INTELLIGENCE WE'RE LOGGING FEEDBACK RECOMMENDATIONS OBSERVATIONS FROM WHAT WE SEE IN COMPLAINTS
POD1000000015_S0000156	SO IF WE SPOT SOMETHING LIKE THAT WE MIGHT JUST WELL MY MY INVESTIGATORS MY COMPLAINTS REVIEWERS WILL LET THE PUBLIC BODY KNOW
POD1000000015_S0000157	WE GIVE FEEDBACK IN DECISIONS
POD1000000015_S0000158	IF WE KEEP SEEING THAT WE MIGHT GIVE IT MORE FORMAL AND SAY WE'VE SPOTTED THIS A NUMBER OF TIMES
POD1000000015_S0000159	BUT IS THERE ANY HELP YOU KNOW WE MIGHT OFFER TO SAY SHARE A TEMPLATE LETTER
POD1000000015_S0000160	OR IF IT'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT PERHAPS GO AND GIVE THEM SOME TRAINING IF WE'VE GOT THE RESOURCES TO DO THAT
POD1000000015_S0000161	BUT WE SET IT OUT STEP BY STEP AT WHICH POINT IT BECOMES A MANAGEMENT ISSUE AND SENIOR MANAGERS MIGHT ACTUALLY CONTACT SENIOR MANAGERS OR CHIEF EXECUTIVES
POD1000000015_S0000162	THE ULTIMATE BEING WE USE THE POWERS THAT THE OMBUDSMAN HAS TO ENFORCE AND REPORT
POD1000000015_S0000164	VERY INCREMENTAL AND CIVILIZED BUT DO YOU DO YOU COME ACROSS INTRANSIGENCE
POD1000000015_S0000165	WELL IT WENT LIVE IN APRIL AND SO FAR WE'VE NOT FOUND INTRANSIGENT
POD1000000015_S0000166	AND I THINK SOME OF THIS IS DRAWING ON EXPERIENCE OF
POD1000000015_S0000167	INFORMATION COMMISSIONER THAT I'LL GIVE YOU A VERY SIMPLE EXAMPLE
POD1000000015_S0000168	SIMILAR POWERS TO COMPEL PRODUCTION OF INFORMATION FOR AN INVESTIGATION
POD1000000015_S0000169	AND TELLING PUBLIC BODIES VERY FORMALLY IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE THIS THIS AND THIS BY THIS DATE I WILL REPORT ON THIS I WILL TAKE FURTHER ACTION
POD1000000015_S0000170	IT CAN ACTUALLY BE CONTEMPT OF TREATED AS CONTEMPT OF COURT IN SCOTLAND
POD1000000015_S0000171	SO YOU ONLY NEED TO MAKE THAT CLEAR THAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT AND TO DO IT ONCE AND THEN REPORT ON IT IN YOUR ANNUAL REPORT
POD1000000015_S0000172	AND ACTUALLY PUBLIC BODIES REALIZE I THINK THAT YOU'RE BEING SERIOUS
POD1000000015_S0000173	BUT WE TRY TO GET TO THE POINT BEFORE THAT WHERE YOU POINT OUT THIS IS THE VALUE PARTICULARLY FOR THE COMPLAINER OF DOING THIS
POD1000000015_S0000174	SO WE'RE IN EARLY DAYS WE HAVEN'T COME ACROSS THE REAL INTRANSIGENCE YET
POD1000000015_S0000175	BUT I'VE NO DOUBT THAT THERE'LL BE SOME THERE AT SOME POINT
POD1000000015_S0000176	BUT THE WORD CIVILIZED IS A GOOD ONE AND WE WILL ENDEAVOUR TO BE AS CIVILIZED AS WE CAN BUT FIRM WITH IT
POD1000000015_S0000177	WHAT IS YOUR YOU REPORT TO THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT
POD1000000015_S0000178	
POD1000000015_S0000179	WHAT IS YOUR RELATIONSHIP LIKE WITH THAT BODY
POD1000000015_S0000180	I'D SAY IT'S PRETTY GOOD IN THE SENSE OF IT'S OPEN CHALLENGING AND WHEN I SAY FRIENDLY I DON'T MEAN WE'RE ALL FRIENDS IT'S IT'S IT'S VERY PROFESSIONAL IN MANY WAYS
POD1000000015_S0000181	SO MY MAIN DEALINGS ARE WITH THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENTARY CORPORATE BODY
POD1000000015_S0000182	I GET MY FUNDING THROUGH THEM SO WE HAVE CONTACT WITH THEM ON A FAIRLY REGULAR BASIS
POD1000000015_S0000183	EACH YEAR I APPEAR BEFORE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND COMMUNITIES COMMITTEE TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR MY ANNUAL REPORT
POD1000000015_S0000184	THEY'LL ASK ME QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR PERFORMANCE ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING
POD1000000015_S0000185	I DO APPEAR BEFORE OTHER COMMITTEES AS WELL EITHER IN RELATION TO OTHER POLICIES OR IN RELATION TO OTHER CONSULTATIONS THAT WE'VE RESPONDED TO
POD1000000015_S0000186	I WOULD SAY IN SCOTLAND THAT GENERALLY THE OMBUDSMAN IS HELD IN HIGH REGARD AND SEEN AS BEING INDEPENDENT AND IMPARTIAL
POD1000000015_S0000187	AND PROBABLY THE THE MOST TELLING EVIDENCE OF THIS IS WE'RE TAKING ON NEW POWERS NEXT YEAR
POD1000000015_S0000188	THIS IS ABOUT WHISTLEBLOWING
POD1000000015_S0000189	YES WE'RE I'M TAKING ON THE WONDERFUL TITLE OF INDEPENDENT NATIONAL WHISTLEBLOWING OFFICER FOR THE NHS IN SCOTLAND
POD1000000015_S0000190	WOW
POD1000000015_S0000191	AND THE REASON THAT WE ARE TAKING ON THIS FUNCTION IS BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT'S PUBLIC CONSULTATION IT WAS SUGGESTED IT SHOULD BE THE OMBUDSMAN
POD1000000015_S0000192	IT'S ANOTHER GOOD EXAMPLE OF HOW IN A SMALLER JURISDICTION YOU GET A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS
POD1000000015_S0000193	BUT GOING BACK TO PARLIAMENT THEY HAVE HELD ME TO ACCOUNT ON THINGS BUT ALSO WHERE I HAVE BROUGHT SOMETHING TO THEM IN MY MY COMMITTEE APPEARANCES THEY'VE ALSO BEEN QUITE SUPPORTIVE
POD1000000015_S0000194	SO ONE OF MY BEEFS ABOUT MY LEGISLATION IS COMPLAINTS MUST BE IN WRITING UNLESS THERE ARE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES
POD1000000015_S0000195	NOW THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THE ONUS IS ON THE COMPLAINER TO SHOW SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES
POD1000000015_S0000196	AND IT MEANS YOU CAN'T BE AS FLEXIBLE IN HOW YOU TAKE COMPLAINTS
POD1000000015_S0000197	
POD1000000015_S0000198	AND I'VE BEEN TRYING SINCE I BECAME OMBUDSMAN TO HAVE THE LEGISLATION IT'S SECONDARY LEGISLATION TO SAY I CAN TAKE COMPLAINTS IN ANY FORMAT
POD1000000015_S0000199	AND AT THE LAST PARLIAMENTARY APPEARANCE THE COMMITTEE DID ACTUALLY WRITE TO THE GOVERNMENT AND SAY WE THINK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA PLEASE COULD YOU LOOK INTO THIS AGAIN FOR US
POD1000000015_S0000200	SADLY THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT ARE NOT TAKING IT FORWARD AT THIS TIME BECAUSE THEY HAVE OTHER BUSINESS AND DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES APPARENTLY WHICH IS VERY DISAPPOINTING
POD1000000015_S0000201	WE'RE COMING TOWARDS THE END BUT LET ME ASK YOU A FEW QUICK FIRE QUESTIONS
POD1000000015_S0000202	YOU'RE FUNDED DIFFERENTLY TO THE WAY WE'RE FUNDED BECAUSE WE WE GET OUR MONEY FROM A BROAD TREASURY VOTE
POD1000000015_S0000203	BUT YOU'RE FUNDED THROUGH PARLIAMENT
POD1000000015_S0000204	HAVE YOU GOT ENOUGH MONEY IS THAT A SATISFACTORY WAY TO DO THINGS
POD1000000015_S0000205	NOW I HAVEN'T GOT ENOUGH MONEY
POD1000000015_S0000206	AND IT'S SATISFACTORY IN THE SENSE OF I THINK IT IS GOOD THAT THE FUNDING DOESN'T COME FROM GOVERNMENT
POD1000000015_S0000207	IT ADDS SOMETHING TO YOUR BEING ABLE TO SAY I AM INDEPENDENT WHAT I THINK IS UNSATISFACTORY ABOUT IT IS AND PROBABLY THE SAME FOR YOU IS THE DUALITY OF IT
POD1000000015_S0000208	IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DO PROPER BUSINESS AND RESOURCE PLANNING WHEN YOU CAN'T GUARANTEE YOU WILL HAVE THE MONEY TO DO IT NEXT YEAR
POD1000000015_S0000209	IT ALSO MEANS THAT I FEEL I DO GO THROUGH SOME FAIRLY UNNECESSARY HOOPS JUST TO GET ONE ADDITIONAL MEMBER OF STAFF OR AN EXTRA LITTLE BIT OF MONEY FOR THIS
POD1000000015_S0000210	WHERE IT DOES WORK WELL AND WHERE I THINK THE CORPORATE BODY REALLY TRY HARD FOR MYSELF AND OTHER PARLIAMENTARY CROWN APPOINTMENTS
POD1000000015_S0000211	IS THEY HOLD A CONTINGENCY FUND TO WHICH WE CAN APPLY
POD1000000015_S0000212	FOR UNEXPECTED THINGS SO IF WE WERE JUDICIALLY REVIEWED WE COULD GET LEGAL COSTS THROUGH THAT
POD1000000015_S0000213	AND THAT WORKS WELL TO THE POINT WE HAD SOME UNEXPECTED IT COSTS THIS YEAR WHICH WE WERE ABLE TO GO TO THE CONTINGENCY FUND
POD1000000015_S0000214	BUT GENERALLY I THINK OMBUDSMEN ACROSS THE UK ARE UNDERFUNDED
POD1000000015_S0000215	IF WE HAD SUFFICIENT FUNDING WE WOULDN'T HAVE BACKLOGS OF CASES WE WOULD BE DOING THINGS QUICKER
POD1000000015_S0000216	BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE DO WITH WHERE WE ARE AT THE MOMENT
POD1000000015_S0000217	TWO FINAL QUESTIONS ROSEMARY FIRST OF ALL GOING FORWARD WHAT'S YOUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE AS THE OMBUDSMAN
POD1000000015_S0000218	ARE YOU AN OMBUDS OR ARE YOU AN OMBUDSMAN
POD1000000015_S0000219	I'M HAPPY TO BE AN OMBUDSMAN BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE LEGISLATION SAYS AND I KNOW THE ORIGINS OF THE WORD
POD1000000015_S0000220	BUT EQUALLY I DON'T MIND IF OTHER PEOPLE CALL ME SOMETHING SIMILAR WHATEVER THEY'RE COMFORTABLE WITH
POD1000000015_S0000221	IT'S THE SPIRIT OF WHAT WE DO THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
POD1000000015_S0000222	I THINK MY BIGGEST CHALLENGE AND THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE FOR MY OFFICE IS A COMBINATION OF RESOURCING AND THE WHISTLEBLOWING WORK THAT'S COMING NEXT YEAR
POD1000000015_S0000223	THAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT IN SOME WAYS
POD1000000015_S0000224	WILL YOU HAVE REGULATORY POWERS
POD1000000015_S0000225	MY POWERS WILL BE VERY SIMILAR AS THEY ARE TO OMBUDSMAN
POD1000000015_S0000226	
POD1000000015_S0000228	IS BIG
POD1000000015_S0000229	
POD1000000015_S0000230	AND IT'S VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT HAPPENS IN ENGLAND
POD1000000015_S0000231	IT'S IT'S ALMOST TOO SIMILAR BUT COMPLETELY DISTINCT FUNCTIONS
POD1000000015_S0000232	TWO DIFFERENT TITLES THAT GO WITH THEM OMBUDSMAN AND INDEPENDENT
POD1000000015_S0000234	AS A RESULT OF THAT
POD1000000015_S0000235	I DON'T KNOW
POD1000000015_S0000237	SAY I WOULD LIKE ONE I DO THE JOB ANYWAY
POD1000000015_S0000238	BUT I SUPPOSE FOR ME THE ISSUE OF THE PAY IS NOT SO MUCH FOR MY TENURE BUT FOR FUTURE OMBUDSMAN
POD1000000015_S0000239	BECAUSE I HAVE A REAL CONCERN ACROSS IN COMMON WITH FELLOW OMBUDSMAN IN THE U K THAT
POD1000000015_S0000240	IF YOU DON'T PAY YOUR OMBUDSMAN ENOUGH TO ATTRACT GOOD OMBUDSMAN YOU CAN'T FOREVER RELY ON WHAT I THINK HAS HAPPENED SO FAR
POD1000000015_S0000241	JUST IN SCOTLAND WE'VE JUST GOT GOOD PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN ATTRACTED TO THE WORK
POD1000000015_S0000242	
POD1000000015_S0000243	SO I HOPE THEY UP THE PAY BUT IF IT'S NOT FOR ME I DON'T MIND
POD1000000015_S0000244	WHAT DOES THE LEGISLATION SAY ABOUT SECOND TERM FOR OMBUDS
POD1000000015_S0000245	IN SCOTLAND THERE ARE NO SECOND TERMS
POD1000000015_S0000246	YOU AFTER FIVE YEARS YOU HAVE TO MOVE ON DO
POD1000000015_S0000247	
POD1000000015_S0000249	SO UNDER PUBLIC SECTOR LAW IT CAN BE FOUR TO EIGHT YEARS
POD1000000015_S0000250	SO AS INFORMATION COMMISSIONER I ACTUALLY HAD A SIX YEAR TENURE THIS ONE IS EIGHT YEARS
POD1000000015_S0000251	BUT AT THE POINT THAT I BECAME OMBUDSMAN IT WAS ALREADY KNOWN THAT WE WOULD BE TAKING ON THE WHISTLEBLOWING SO IT'S PROBABLY RIGHT FOR THAT
POD1000000015_S0000252	CAUSE JUST THE NEARLY THREE YEARS GETTING TO THE POINT OF KNOWING WHAT THE LEGISLATION IS GOING TO SAY HAS BEEN OVER IN A BLINK OF AN EYE
POD1000000015_S0000253	OKAY LAST QUESTION WE'RE IN MANCHESTER THIS IS A YOUNG THRIVING ORGANIZATION FULL OF YOUNG GRADUATES WHO'VE JUST COME INTO THE OMBUDSMAN WORLD

POD1000000015_S0000256	WHAT WOULD BE YOUR ADVICE TO MY COLLEAGUES JUST COMING INTO THE OMBUDS FIELD
POD1000000015_S0000257	DON'T EVER LOSE SIGHT OF THE PASSION OF WHAT DRIVES YOU TO DO THE RIGHT THING FOR THE RIGHT REASONS
POD1000000015_S0000258	BUT LEAVE OMBUDSMAN FOR A WHILE AND GO AND DO SOMETHING ELSE AND COME BACK TO IT
POD1000000015_S0000259	SO THAT YOU CAN SEE JUST HOW WONDERFUL A VALUES BASED ORGANIZATION IS BUT ALSO SO YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON WORLD EXPERIENCES

POD1000000016_S0000021	WHEN THEY HAD NOT SEEN THEIR LAND OR ANY LAND FOR SO MANY DAYS THAT THEY LOST COUNT
POD1000000016_S0000023	IT WAS AFTER THE FEAR HAD TURNED TO DESPAIR AND THE DESPAIR TO RESIGNATION AND THE RESIGNATION GAVE WAY FINALLY TO RESOLVE
POD1000000016_S0000025	THEY KNEW THEN THAT THEY WOULD NOT HUG THEIR GRANDMOTHERS AGAIN OR SHARE LAUGH WITH A COUSIN DURING HIS NUPTIALS OR SING THEIR BABIES SOFTLY TO SLEEP WITH THE SAME LULLABIES THAT THEIR MOTHERS HAD ONCE SUNG TO THEM
POD1000000016_S0000027	TILL ETERNITY OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN HAD SEVERED THEM SO COMPLETELY THAT IT WAS AS IF NOTHING HAD EVER EXISTED BEFORE
POD1000000016_S0000029	EVERYTHING THEY EVER KNEW HAD SIMPLY VANISHED FROM THE EARTH
POD1000000016_S0000031	SOME COULD NOT BEAR THE REALIZATION
POD1000000016_S0000033	THEY HAVE THEMSELVES OVER THE WALLS OF WOODEN SHIPS TO SWIM ONE LAST TIME WITH THEIR ANCESTORS
POD1000000016_S0000035	OTHERS REFUSED TO EAT MOUTHS CLAMPED SHUT UNTIL THEIR HEARTS GAVE OUT
POD1000000016_S0000037	BUT IN THE SUFFOCATING HOLE OF A SHIP CALLED THE WHITE LION BOUND FOR WHERE THEY DID NOT KNOW
POD1000000016_S0000038	THOSE WHO REFUSED TO DIE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE MEN AND WOMEN CHAINED NEXT TO THEM IN THE DARK WERE NO LONGER STRANGERS
POD1000000016_S0000040	THEY HAD BEEN FORGED IN TRAUMA
POD1000000016_S0000042	HE HAD BEEN MADE BLACK BY THOSE WHO BELIEVED THEMSELVES TO BE WHITE
POD1000000016_S0000044	WHERE THEY WERE HEADED BLACK EQUAL SLAVE
POD1000000016_S0000046	SO THESE WERE THEIR PEOPLE NOW
POD1000000016_S0000048	WHAT HAPPENED HERE
POD1000000016_S0000050	I MEAN WE REALLY DON'T KNOW A LOT
POD1000000016_S0000052	A PIRATE SHIP BY THE NAME OF WHITE LION SAILS INTO THE BAY HERE
POD1000000016_S0000053	AND THEY NEEDED TO TRADE SOMETHING OF VALUE SO THAT THEY COULD GET SUPPLIES TO MAKE THE REST OF THEIR JOURNEY AND WHAT THEY TRADED WERE TWENTY TO THIRTY AFRICANS
POD1000000016_S0000054	AND THIS WOULD BE AT THIS PLACE KIND OF IRONICALLY CALLED POINT COMFORT WHERE SLAVERY IN THE BRITISH NORTH AMERICAN COLONIES THAT WOULD GO ON TO BECOME THE UNITED STATES BEGINS
POD1000000016_S0000056	FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE I'M NICOLE HANNAH JONES THIS IS SIXTEEN NINETEEN

POD1000000016_S0000061	
POD1000000016_S0000062	WHEN I WAS A CHILD MY DAD ALWAYS FLEW A FLAG IN OUR FRONT YARD OUR HOUSE WAS ON A CORNER LOT AND IN THE FRONT YARD RIGHT IN THE CORNER WAS
POD1000000016_S0000063	I COULDN'T TELL YOU HOW TALL IT WAS IT ALWAYS SEEMED REALLY GARISHLY TALL TO ME AT THE TIME THERE WAS THIS VERY TALL ALUMINUM FLAGPOLE MY PARENTS DIDN'T MAKE A LOT OF MONEY SO OUR HOUSE ALWAYS HAD PAINT CHIPPING
POD1000000016_S0000064	THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING ABOUT THE HOUSE THAT WAS IN DISARRAY YOU KNOW THE GRASS WAS LOOKING DISHEVELED OR THE RAILING ON THE STAIRS WAS FALLING OFF BUT THE FLAG WAS ALWAYS PRISTINE
POD1000000016_S0000065	AS SOON AS IT STARTED TO SHOW EVEN THE SLIGHTEST TATTER MY DAD WOULD REPLACE THE FLAG WITH A FRESH NEW FLAG
POD1000000016_S0000066	HE WOULD NEVER ALLOW A TATTERED FLAG TO FLY AND I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT I I DIDN'T KNOW OTHER BLACK KIDS WHOSE PARENTS WERE FLYING FLAG IN THEIR FRONT YARD
POD1000000016_S0000067	I KNEW LOTS OF WHITE PEOPLE WHO FLEW FLAGS LOTS OF WHITE PEOPLE WHO FLEW FLAGS
POD1000000016_S0000069	MY DAD WAS BORN ON A SHARECROPPING FARM IN GREENWOOD MISSISSIPPI WHERE HIS FAMILY PICKED COTTON IN THE SAME COTTON FIELDS THAT ENSLAVED PEOPLE HAD PICKED COTTON NOT TOO LONG BEFORE
POD1000000016_S0000070	THAT COUNTY LEFLORE COUNTY IN MISSISSIPPI LYNCHED MORE BLACK PEOPLE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTY IN MISSISSIPPI AND MISSISSIPPI LYNCHED MORE BLACK PEOPLE THAN ANY OTHER STATE IN THE COUNTRY
POD1000000016_S0000071	SO IT WAS A PRETTY DEVASTATINGLY VIOLENT AND HARD PLACE TO LIVE
POD1000000016_S0000073	MY DAD'S MOM FLED THE SOUTH LIKE MILLIONS OF OTHER BLACK PEOPLE DURING THE GREAT MIGRATION AND CAME NORTH TO WATERLOO AND FOUND MANY OF THE SAME BARRIERS THAT SHE HAD SOUGHT TO ESCAPE
POD1000000016_S0000074	SHE WAS FORCED TO BUY A HOUSE ON THE BLACK SIDE OF TOWN MOST JOBS WERE UNAVAILABLE TO HER SO SHE CLEANED WHITE PEOPLE'S HOUSES MY FATHER WENT TO SEGREGATED SCHOOLS
POD1000000016_S0000075	AND AT A YOUNG AGE MY FATHER JOINED THE MILITARY SO THAT HE COULD GET HIS WAY OUT OF POVERTY BUT ALSO FOR THE REASONS THAT SO MANY BLACK PEOPLE JOINED THE MILITARY
POD1000000016_S0000076	WHICH IS HE HOPED THAT IF HE SERVED HIS COUNTRY HIS COUNTRY MIGHT FINALLY SEE HIM AS AN AMERICAN
POD1000000016_S0000077	HE LOVED BEING IN THE ARMY HE WAS STATIONED IN GERMANY PICKED UP GERMAN VERY QUICKLY HE WAS SO SMART
POD1000000016_S0000078	HE LOVED TALKING ABOUT THAT TIME IT WAS A PERIOD WHERE HE GOT TO SEE THINGS THAT POOR BLACK CHILD BORN IN MISSISSIPPI WOULD NOT NORMALLY GET TO SEE
POD1000000016_S0000079	BUT THE MILITARY DIDN'T END UP BEING A WAY OUT FOR MY DAD FOR LONG HE WAS PASSED UP FOR OPPORTUNITIES
POD1000000016_S0000080	AND THE ONLY JOBS MY DAD EVER WORKED WERE SERVICE JOBS HE WORKED AS A CONVENIENCE STORE CLERK OR A BUS DRIVER AND BECAUSE OF THAT
POD1000000016_S0000081	THIS BIG PRISTINE AMERICAN FLAG FLYING IN THE FRONT OF OUR YARD WAS DEEPLY EMBARRASSING TO ME
POD1000000016_S0000082	AND I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY HE WOULD FEEL THAT MUCH LOVE FOR A COUNTRY THAT CLEARLY DID NOT LOVE HIM
POD1000000016_S0000084	I FELT THIS WAY ALL THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL I WAS NO LONGER STANDING FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM I HAD STOPPED SAYING THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE AND REALLY
POD1000000016_S0000085	THROUGHOUT MOST OF MY ADULT LIFE I MEAN CLEARLY I KNOW I'M AN AMERICAN
POD1000000016_S0000086	I WAS BORN HERE EVERY FAMILY MEMBER FOR GENERATIONS BACK THAT I KNOW WE'RE ALL BORN HERE BUT I NEVER FELT LIKE I COULD CLAIM FULLY THAT I WAS AN AMERICAN
POD1000000016_S0000088	BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL I REALLY STARTED RESEARCHING AND READING AND THINKING ABOUT THIS PROJECT THAT MY OWN THINKING STARTED TO SHIFT
POD1000000016_S0000089	THAT I REALIZED MY DAD UNDERSTOOD THINGS THAT I NEVER KNEW
POD1000000016_S0000090	I NOW UNDERSTAND FOR THE FIRST TIME WHY MY DAD WAS SO PROUD TO FLY THAT FLAG
POD1000000016_S0000093	MY NAME IS ANN HUGHES I WAS BORN IN CHARLOTTESVILLE VIRGINIA
POD1000000016_S0000094	MY GRANDFATHER BELONGED TO THOMAS JEFFERSON MY GRANDFATHER WAS A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN YEARS OLD WHEN HE DIED AND NOW I AM ONE HUNDRED AND ONE YEAR
POD1000000016_S0000095	NOW MY BOY DAYS WE WERE SLAVES WE BELONGED TO PEOPLE THEY SELL US LIKE THOSE HORSES AND COWS AND ALL LIKE THAT HAVE ACTION BENCH
POD1000000016_S0000096	PUT YOU ON THE BENCH AND BET ON YOU JUST SAME AS YOU'RE BETTING ON IT YOU KNOW
POD1000000016_S0000097	BUT STILL I DON'T LIKE BECAUSE IT MAKES MAKES PEOPLE FEEL BAD
POD1000000016_S0000099	SO YOU KIND OF HAVE TO PUT YOURSELF IN THE SCENE IT IS JUNE OF SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SIX AND THOMAS JEFFERSON
POD1000000016_S0000100	AT THE VERY YOUNG AGE OF THIRTY THREE YEARS OLD HAS BEEN TASKED WITH DRAFTING THE DOCUMENT THAT IS GOING TO DECLARE TO THE WORLD WHY THE BRITISH NORTH AMERICAN COLONIES THE THIRTEEN COLONIES WANT TO BREAK OFF FROM THE BRITISH EMPIRE
POD1000000016_S0000101	HE GOES TO PHILADELPHIA AND RENTS TWO ROOMS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN ALONG THE RIVER AND SITS DOWN TO DRAFT WHAT WE ALL KNOW NOW IS THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE
POD1000000016_S0000102	WHEN IN THE COURSE OF HUMAN EVENTS IT BECOMES NECESSARY FOR ONE PEOPLE TO DISSOLVE THE POLITICAL BANDS WHICH HAVE CONNECTED THEM WITH ANOTHER
POD1000000016_S0000104	HE'S SITTING AT THIS PORTABLE MAHOGANY WRITING DESK THAT HE CARRIES WITH HIM AND HE PULLS OUT SOME PAPER AND A VERY NICE QUILL PEN
POD1000000016_S0000105	AND HE STARTS TO WRITE THESE WORDS THAT ALMOST EVERY AMERICAN CAN RECITE BY HEART
POD1000000016_S0000106	DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF EVIDENT
POD1000000016_S0000108	THEY BECOME SOME OF THE MOST FAMOUS WORDS IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE
POD1000000016_S0000109	THEY ARE ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN
POD1000000016_S0000111	LIFE AND LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS THAT'S WHAT MAKES US UNIQUE THAT'S WHAT MAKES US STRONG THE SHARED VALUES THAT WE ALL HOLD SO DEAR
POD1000000016_S0000113	BUT WHAT MOST AMERICANS DON'T KNOW IS THAT WHILE HE'S WRITING THESE LOFTY WORDS FOR LIBERATION
POD1000000016_S0000114	HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM ONE OF THE MANY ENSLAVED PEOPLE WHOM HE OWNED IN ORDER TO SERVE HIM AND TO KEEP HIM COMFORTABLE NOW THAT ENSLAVED PERSON WAS A TEENAGER
POD1000000016_S0000115	AND THAT TEENAGER WAS THE HALF BROTHER OF THOMAS JEFFERSON'S WIFE WHAT THAT MEANS IS THOMAS JEFFERSON'S FATHER IN LAW HAD CHILDREN WITH ONE OF THE WOMEN THAT HE ENSLAVED
POD1000000016_S0000116	SO ACTUALLY HE WAS THOMAS JEFFERSON'S BROTHER IN LAW AND SO AS HE'S WRITING THESE IDEAS HE KNOWS THAT THEY WILL NOT APPLY EVEN TO HIS OWN FAMILY MEMBERS
POD1000000016_S0000118	AT THE TIME THAT THOMAS JEFFERSON IS DRAFTING THE DECLARATION HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THOSE FIRST AFRICANS WERE SOLD INTO VIRGINIA
POD1000000016_S0000119	THE ENSLAVED POPULATION HAS GROWN FROM TWENTY TO NOW FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE FULLY ONE FIFTH OF THE POPULATION IS NOW ENSLAVED
POD1000000016_S0000120	IT HAS GROWN FROM A CONDITIONAL INSTITUTION WHERE SOME OF THOSE FIRST TWENTY WERE ABLE TO BECOME FREE AFTER A TERM OF TIME TO ONE WHERE BLACK PEOPLE ARE BORN INTO
POD1000000016_S0000121	THEY DIE INTO IT AND THEY PASS THAT STATUS ON TO THEIR CHILDREN YOU NOW HAVE GENERATIONS OF BLACK PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER KNOWN A DAY OF FREEDOM AND WHO WILL NEVER KNOW A DAY OF FREEDOM
POD1000000016_S0000122	AND YET WHEN THOMAS JEFFERSON'S CONTEMPORARIES TALK IN PUBLIC ABOUT WHY THE COLONISTS NEED TO BE FREE FROM ENGLAND THEY REFER TO THEMSELVES AS SLAVES
POD1000000016_S0000123	AS SLAVES TO THE KING OF ENGLAND AND SO THE COLONISTS ARE BEING CRITICIZED IN NEWSPAPERS FOR THIS OBVIOUS DUPLICITY BY THOSE WHO DON'T BELIEVE THAT THEY SHOULD BREAK OFF FROM THE BRITISH EMPIRE
POD1000000016_S0000124	ONE OF THEM WRITES HOW IS IT THAT WE HEAR THE LOUDEST YELPS FOR FREEDOM FROM THE DRIVERS OF NEGROES ANOTHER WRITES TO BENJAMIN FRANKLIN AND SAYS PERHAPS YOU SHOULD ASK THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY ENSLAVED WHAT SLAVERY IS LIKE
POD1000000016_S0000125	THOMAS JEFFERSON OF COURSE IS DEEPLY AWARE OF THE HYPOCRISY AND AWARE OF THE CRITICISM OF THE HYPOCRISY SO AS HE'S DRAFTING THE DECLARATION
POD1000000016_S0000126	HE INCLUDES A PASSAGE IN THERE WHERE HE ACTUALLY BLAME THE KING OF ENGLAND FOR INTRODUCING SLAVERY INTO THE COLONIES HE CALLED SLAVERY A CRIME AND HE SAYS THAT THE KING OF ENGLAND COMMITTED THIS CRIME
POD1000000016_S0000127	BUT THAT'S NOT OUR FAULT IT WAS NOT OUR DOING THIS IS JUST ONE MORE THING THAT THE KING OF ENGLAND DID TO WRONG US SO HE BRINGS THIS DOCUMENT TO THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS
POD1000000016_S0000128	AND IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG BEFORE DELEGATES FROM THE CAROLINAS AND FROM GEORGIA LOOK AT THAT LANGUAGE ABOUT SLAVERY AND ONE CAN IMAGINE THEY SAID WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING
POD1000000016_S0000129	AND THEY SAY THAT THERE IS NO WAY THAT THEY ARE GOING TO SIGN THIS DOCUMENT AS LONG AS THAT PASSAGE ABOUT SLAVERY REMAINS AND SO IT IS STRUCK AND THE THIRTEEN COLONIES SIGNED THE DECLARATION
POD1000000016_S0000130	AND THE DECLARATION GOES OUT INTO THE WORLD WITHOUT MENTIONING SLAVERY AT ALL AND WE START THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR
POD1000000016_S0000132	SOMEHOW MIRACULOUSLY THESE THIRTEEN SCRAPPY COLONIES MANAGED TO DEFEAT ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL EMPIRES IN THE WORLD AND WE BECOME A NEW NATION
POD1000000016_S0000133	AND SO THE COLONISTS GATHER AND THEY TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE LANGUAGE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO CREATE IN THE FOUNDING DOCUMENT THAT WE OF COURSE COME TO KNOW AS THE CONSTITUTION BUT NOW THEY HAVE A PROBLEM
POD1000000016_S0000134	THEY WERE TRYING TO LEAVE BEHIND AN OLD COUNTRY THAT THEY BELIEVED WAS ANTITHETICAL TO FREEDOM AND CREATE A NEW ONE THAT THEY BELIEVED WOULD BE DEFINED BY FREEDOM
POD1000000016_S0000135	THIS WAS A COUNTRY THAT WAS GOING TO BE BASED ON INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS ON A GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE FOR THE PEOPLE AND BY THE PEOPLE
POD1000000016_S0000136	BUT THIS WAS ALSO A PLACE THAT AT THIS TIME WAS STILL PRACTICING THE INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY
POD1000000016_S0000137	AND SO THE COLONISTS HAVE A CHOICE TO MAKE ARE THEY GOING TO BE THE COUNTRY OF THEIR IDEALS THE IDEALS THAT THEY WERE PUTTING TO PAPER A COUNTRY BASED ON THE IDEA THAT ALL MEN WERE CREATED EQUAL
POD1000000016_S0000138	AND IF THEY WERE GOING TO BE THAT COUNTRY THEN THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE TO ABOLISH THE INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY OR WERE THEY GOING TO BE WEDDED TO THE INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY BECAUSE THEY DEPENDED SO HEAVILY ON THE WEALTH THAT WAS BEING GENERATED FROM IT
POD1000000016_S0000139	AND IN THAT CASE THEY CAN'T REALLY WRITE THE DOCUMENT THAT THEY WANT TO WRITE AND SO WHAT THEY DO IS THEY DECIDE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO HAVE IT BOTH WAYS
POD1000000016_S0000140	AND THEY BAKE THAT CONTRADICTION RIGHT INTO THE CONSTITUTION BOTH CODIFYING AND PROTECTING THE INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY BUT NEVER ACTUALLY MENTIONING THE WORD
POD1000000016_S0000141	AND SO THEY HAVE WRITTEN WHAT IS PERHAPS THE MOST RADICAL CONSTITUTION IN THE WORLD AND FROM THE BEGINNING THEY KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO VIOLATE ITS MOST ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES
POD1000000016_S0000143	THEY CALL THIS NEW COUNTRY A DEMOCRACY BUT IT WASN'T ONE NOT YET
POD1000000016_S0000145	ON AUGUST FOURTEEN EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO ABRAHAM LINCOLN INVITED FIVE FREE BLACK MEN TO THE WHITE HOUSE FOR A MEETING
POD1000000016_S0000146	THEY ARE PART OF THE BLACK ELITE IN WASHINGTON DC AND HE WANTS TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THEM
POD1000000016_S0000147	THE CIVIL WAR HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND ABRAHAM LINCOLN IS WORRIED BECAUSE THE WAR IS NOT GOING WELL AND BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOING WELL HE'S FEELING LIKE HE MIGHT HAVE TO DO SOMETHING DRASTIC
POD1000000016_S0000148	HE'S CONSIDERING TAKING THIS VERY RADICAL STEP OF LIBERATING ALL OF THE ENSLAVED PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE CONFEDERATE STATES
POD1000000016_S0000149	AND HE'S THINKING ABOUT DOING THIS AS A WAR TACTIC UNDERSTANDING THAT IF HE TAKES AWAY THE SOUTH'S LABOR FORCE THAT MIGHT CRIPPLE THEM OR AT LEAST THE THREAT OF IT WOULD FORCE THEM TO REMAIN IN THE UNION
POD1000000016_S0000150	BUT HE'S ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT IT MIGHT MEAN TO SUDDENLY FREE FOUR MILLION ENSLAVED PEOPLE AND WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT MIGHT BE
POD1000000016_S0000152	I CAN IMAGINE THESE FIVE DISTINGUISHED MEN ARE VERY EXCITED TO GET LINCOLN'S INVITATION THEY ARE ABOLITIONISTS THEY HAVE BEEN PRESSURING LINCOLN TO ABOLISH SLAVERY
POD1000000016_S0000153	BUT WHEN THEY GET THERE THEY ARE GREETED BY PRESIDENT LINCOLN AND ANOTHER MAN HIS NAME IS JAMES MITCHELL JAMES MITCHELL IS A NEW EMPLOYEE HE'S ONLY BEEN AT THE WHITE HOUSE FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS
POD1000000016_S0000154	AND HIS JOB IS A NEW JOB AND IT'S CALLED COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION NOW THAT'S IMMIGRATION WITH MEANING HIS JOB WAS NOT TO HELP PEOPLE TO ENTER THE COUNTRY BUT TO HELP PEOPLE TO EXIT IT
POD1000000016_S0000156	LINCOLN DOESN'T WASTE ANY TIME ACCORDING TO DOCUMENTS THAT RECOUNT WHAT HAPPENED THAT DAY
POD1000000016_S0000158	HE TELLS THE MAN THAT HE HAD GOTTEN FUNDS FROM CONGRESS TO SHIP BLACK PEOPLE ONCE THEY HAD BEEN FREED TO SOME OTHER COUNTRY
POD1000000016_S0000160	AND THEN LINCOLN SAID YOU AND WE ARE DIFFERENT RACES YOUR RACE SUFFER VERY GREATLY MANY OF THEM BY LIVING AMONGST US WHILE OUR SUFFER FROM YOUR PRESENCE
POD1000000016_S0000161	IN A WORD HE SAID WE SUFFER ON EACH SIDE
POD1000000016_S0000163	WE ARE TAUGHT TO THINK OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN AS THE GREAT EMANCIPATOR AND HE WAS BUT THE TRUTH IS LIKE MANY WHITE AMERICANS HE WAS OPPOSED TO SLAVERY BECAUSE IT WAS A CRUEL AND UNJUST INSTITUTION IN OPPOSITION TO THIS NATION'S IDEALS
POD1000000016_S0000164	BUT HE WAS ALSO OPPOSED TO BLACK POLITICAL AND SOCIAL EQUALITY AS HE SAID IN A SPEECH THAT HE GAVE IN FIFTY THREE HE CONSIDERED BLACK PEOPLE A QUOTE TROUBLESOME PRESENCE
POD1000000016_S0000165	AND THAT THEY WERE INCOMPATIBLE WITH DEMOCRACY THAT WAS DESIGNED FOR WHITE PEOPLE AS HE SAID IN THAT SPEECH FREE THEM AND MAKE THEM POLITICALLY AND SOCIALLY OUR EQUALS MY OWN FEELINGS WILL NOT ADMIT OF THIS AND IF MINE WOULD
POD1000000016_S0000166	WE WELL KNOW THAT THOSE OF THE GREAT MASS OF WHITE PEOPLE WILL NOT
POD1000000016_S0000168	AS THOSE FIVE BLACK MEN STOOD IN THE WHITE HOUSE I WONDER WHAT IT MUST HAVE FELT LIKE
POD1000000016_S0000170	THESE MEN HAD BEEN FIGHTING FOR THE LIBERATION OF MILLIONS AND HAD WAITED FOR THIS MOMENT ONLY TO BE TOLD THAT ONCE THEY WERE GRANTED THEIR FREEDOM THEY WERE GOING TO BE ASKED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY OF THEIR BIRTH
POD1000000016_S0000172	AND TO MAKE IT EVEN WORSE LINCOLN THEN TELLS THEM THAT IT'S THEIR FAULT THAT THE COUNTRY IS FIGHTING A CIVIL WAR AT ALL
POD1000000016_S0000173	HE SAYS ALTHOUGH MANY MEN ENGAGED ON EITHER SIDE DO NOT CARE FOR YOU ONE WAY OR THE OTHER WITHOUT THE INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY AND THE COLORED RACE AS A BASIS THE WAR COULD NOT HAVE AN EXISTENCE
POD1000000016_S0000174	THAT'S WHY THE PRESIDENT SAID IT IS BETTER FOR US BOTH THEREFORE TO BE SEPARATED
POD1000000016_S0000176	SO LINCOLN ENDS THE MEETING AND ONE OF THE MEN TELLS HIM THAT THEY WILL GO BACK AND CONSIDER HIS PROPOSAL LINCOLN THEN TELLS THEM TAKE YOUR FULL TIME NO HURRY AT ALL
POD1000000016_S0000178	AFTER THAT MEETING THOSE MEN MADE IT CLEAR THAT THEY WERE NOT INTERESTED IN TAKING LINCOLN UP ON HIS OFFER TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY OF THEIR BIRTH
POD1000000016_S0000180	THERE'S A QUOTE BY A DIFFERENT GROUP OF BLACK ABOLITIONISTS THAT REALLY SUMS UP THE WAY THAT MOST BLACK AMERICANS FELT AND THAT QUOTE SAID THIS IS OUR HOME AND THIS IS OUR COUNTRY
POD1000000016_S0000181	BENEATH ITS SAD LIE THE BONES OF OUR FATHERS HERE WE WERE BORN AND HERE WE WILL DIE
POD1000000016_S0000183	AFTER EVERYTHING THAT BLACK AMERICANS HAVE BEEN THROUGH IN THIS COUNTRY THAT THEY DIDN'T IMMEDIATELY TAKE UP LINCOLN'S OFFER AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE AND START OVER IS REALLY AN ASTOUNDING TESTIMONY TO THEIR BELIEF IN THE AMERICAN IDEALS
POD1000000016_S0000185	BY CHOOSING TO STAY BLACK PEOPLE WERE SAYING THIS IS OUR COUNTRY WE ARE AMERICAN AND WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO WORK TO MAKE THESE FOUNDING IDEALS A REALITY
POD1000000016_S0000187	AND IN THE YEARS THAT FOLLOWED AFTER THE CIVIL WAR ENDS A VERY SHORT PERIOD CALLED RECONSTRUCTION BEGAN
POD1000000016_S0000189	AND SO YOU SEE THE FORMERLY ENSLAVED PUSHING THEIR WHITE ALLIES IN CONGRESS TO START TO CHANGE OUR FOUNDING DOCUMENT AND TO ACTUALLY RESOLVE THOSE CONTRADICTIONS THAT WERE BAKED IN
POD1000000016_S0000190	THEY DO THIS THROUGH GETTING AMENDMENTS PASSED AND OF COURSE AMENDMENTS ARE THE WAY THAT WE CHANGE OUR CONSTITUTION
POD1000000016_S0000192	SO OF COURSE THE VERY FIRST AMENDMENT THAT THEY HAVE TO PASS IS THE THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT WHICH ABOLISHES THE INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY
POD1000000016_S0000193	AND WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THAT IS THIS IS ACTUALLY THE FIRST TIME THAT THE WORD SLAVERY IS MENTIONED IN THE CONSTITUTION IS IN THE AMENDMENT THAT FINALLY ABOLISHES IT
POD1000000016_S0000195	IT ALSO ENSURES FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT THE LAWS CANNOT TREAT PEOPLE DIFFERENTLY BASED ON THEIR RACE THIS IS CALLED THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE
POD1000000016_S0000196	AND THIS CLAUSE WILL BE USED AGAIN AND AGAIN REALLY ALL THE WAY UP UNTIL NOW TO GUARANTEE THAT ALL AMERICANS ARE TREATED AS EQUAL CITIZENS
POD1000000016_S0000198	AND FINALLY THEY PASSED THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT WHICH PROBABLY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT AMENDMENT WHEN WE'RE CONSIDERING WHAT A DEMOCRACY IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT GUARANTEED THE RIGHT TO VOTE NO MATTER WHAT YOUR RACE IS
POD1000000016_S0000199	NOW IT DIDN'T INCLUDE WOMEN AT THAT TIME BUT IT CERTAINLY SET THE STAGE AND IT FOR THE FIRST TIME GUARANTEED THAT WHETHER YOU WERE BORN A PERSON WHO WAS ENSLAVED WHETHER YOU'RE WHITE OR YOU WERE BLACK YOU HAD THE RIGHT TO EXERCISE YOUR VOTE IN THIS DEMOCRACY
POD1000000016_S0000201	THE ONLY REASON WE SAW ALL OF THESE GAINS IN THE SOUTH WAS BECAUSE THERE WERE FEDERAL TROOPS THERE AND THOSE FEDERAL TROOPS WERE HOLDING BACK THE VIOLENCE OF WHITE SOUTHERNERS WHO WERE NOT INTERESTED IN SEEING THESE GAINS
POD1000000016_S0000202	THIS ALL CHANGES WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX
POD1000000016_S0000204	IT WAS A CONTESTED ELECTION AND RUTHERFORD B HAYES IS THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE AND REMEMBER BACK THEN IT WAS REPUBLICANS WHO WERE THE PROGRESSIVE PARTY AND THEY WERE THE PARTY OF LINCOLN THAT WAS WORKING TO PASS ALL OF THIS PROGRESSIVE LEGISLATION
POD1000000016_S0000206	BUT RUTHERFORD B HAYES REALLY WANTS TO WIN THIS ELECTION
POD1000000016_S0000207	AND SO HE MAKES A DEAL WITH THE DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS THAT IF THEY GIVE HIM THEIR ELECTORAL VOTES HE WILL WITHDRAW THE FEDERAL TROOPS FROM THE SOUTH AND END RECONSTRUCTION
POD1000000016_S0000209	SO HE MAKES THE DEAL AND THE TROOPS LEAVE AND WE IMMEDIATELY SEE WHITE SOUTHERNERS IMPLEMENT A CAMPAIGN TO FORCE BLACK PEOPLE BACK INTO THE POSITION THAT THEY HAD BEEN IN BEFORE RECONSTRUCTION
POD1000000016_S0000211	THE SUPPRESSION OF BLACK LIFE OVER THE NEXT FIVE DECADES WOULD BE SO DEVASTATING THAT IT WOULD COME TO BE KNOWN AS THE GREAT NADER THE SECOND SLAVERY
POD1000000016_S0000213	TELL YOU THE TRUTH WHEN I THINK OF IT TODAY I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M LIVING I'M THE OLDEST ONE THAT I KNOW IS LIVING BUT STILL I'M THANKFUL TO THE LORD
POD1000000016_S0000215	CUTTING PEOPLE TREE OUGHT TO BE ALL TIME
POD1000000016_S0000217	I THOUGHT THAT I'D EVER BE A SLAVE AGAIN I TAKE A GUN AND JUST END IT ALL RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A DOG
POD1000000016_S0000219	NOTHING BUT A DOG
POD1000000016_S0000221	THE DAY OF DAYS FOR AMERICA AND HER ALLIES CROWDS BEFORE THE WHITE HOUSE AWAIT THE ANNOUNCEMENT
POD1000000016_S0000222	I HAVE RECEIVED THIS AFTERNOON A MESSAGE FROM THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT WHICH SPECIFIES THE UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER OF JAPAN
POD1000000016_S0000223	REPORTERS RUSH OUT TO RELAY THE NEWS TO AN ANXIOUS WORLD AND TOUCH OFF CELEBRATION THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY JOY IS UNCONFINED
POD1000000016_S0000225	IT'S FEBRUARY OF NINE FORTY SIX AND A YOUNG BLACK MAN IS SITTING ON A BUS WATCHING THE GEORGIA PINES FLY PAST THE WINDOWS HE'S ON HIS WAY TO SEE HIS WIFE AND HE'S PROBABLY VERY EXCITED BECAUSE HE'S BEEN AWAY AT WAR AND HE HASN'T SEEN HER IN A VERY LONG TIME
POD1000000016_S0000226	HE'D BEEN FIGHTING FOR THIS COUNTRY IN WORLD WAR TWO AND JUST THAT DAY HE'D BEEN HONORABLY DISCHARGED FOR HIS SERVICE BUT HE IS A BLACK MAN WHO IS RETURNING TO THE JIM CROW SOUTH
POD1000000016_S0000228	WHAT HAPPENED ON THAT DAY IS A STORY THAT WOULD BE TOLD ACROSS THE COUNTRY
POD1000000016_S0000229	GOOD MORNING THIS IS ORSON WELLS SPEAKING I'D LIKE TO READ TO YOU AN AFFIDAVIT
POD1000000016_S0000230	IT WAS A STORY THAT WOULD ACTUALLY CHANGE THE COURSE OF HISTORY
POD1000000016_S0000232	HE'S RIDING THE BUS THROUGH GEORGIA
POD1000000016_S0000234	HE WANTS TO GET OFF AND USE THE RESTROOM
POD1000000016_S0000236	BUS DRIVER GETS UPSET WITH HIM AND THEY HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF AN ARGUMENT WATER DOESN'T THINK MUCH OF IT HE GOES TO THE BATHROOM RUNS BACK TO THE BUS AND THE BUS KEEPS GOING BUT THEN A FEW MILES DOWN THE ROAD THE BUS STOPS
POD1000000016_S0000237	AND THE BUS DRIVER GETS OFF THE BUS AND THEN CALLS AND TELLS WATER THAT HE NEEDS TO GET OFF THE BUS AS WELL SO WATER GETS OFF THE BUS AND BEFORE HE CAN EVEN UTTER A WORD
POD1000000016_S0000239	STRUCK IN THE HEAD BY A POLICE OFFICER
POD1000000016_S0000241	AND THE BLOWS KEEP COMING AND THEY KEEP COMING TO THE POINT THAT WATER LOSES CONSCIOUSNESS
POD1000000016_S0000243	WORD IS STILL WEARING HIS CRISP ARMY UNIFORM HE'S BEEN DISCHARGED JUST A FEW HOURS EARLIER WHEN HE COMES TO HE'S IN JAIL
POD1000000016_S0000245	I WOKE UP NEXT MORNING AND COULD NOT SEE
POD1000000016_S0000246	HE WAS BEATEN SO SEVERELY BY THAT POLICE OFFICER THAT HE WOULD NEVER SEE AGAIN
POD1000000016_S0000248	WATER'S BEATING WAS NOT AT ALL UNUSUAL WORLD WAR TWO HAD DONE EXACTLY WHAT MANY WHITE PEOPLE HAD FEARED
POD1000000016_S0000249	THAT ONCE BLACK PEOPLE WERE ALLOWED TO FIGHT IN THE MILITARY AND WHEN THEY TRAVELED ABROAD AND THEY EXPERIENCED WHAT IT WAS LIKE NOT TO LIVE UNDER A SYSTEM OF RACIAL APARTHEID THAT IT WOULD BE MUCH HARDER TO CONTROL THEM WHEN THEY CAME BACK
POD1000000016_S0000250	BLACK MEN IN THEIR UNIFORMS WERE SEEING AS BEING UNDULY PROUD SO THESE MEN WHO HAD SERVED THEIR COUNTRY WHO WOULD COME HOME PROUDLY WEARING THE UNIFORM TO SHOW THEIR SERVICE FOR THEIR COUNTRY
POD1000000016_S0000251	WOULD FIND THAT THIS ACTUALLY MADE THEM A TARGET OF SOME OF THE MOST SEVERE VIOLENCE BUT WHAT WAS UNUSUAL WAS WHAT HAPPENED AFTER WARD'S CASE WAS PICKED UP BY THE NCP AND THEY TAKE HIM ON A BIT OF A TOUR
POD1000000016_S0000252	WHERE THEY'RE SAYING LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS MAN WHO SERVED HIS COUNTRY
POD1000000016_S0000254	AND THAT'S LARGELY SEEN AS ONE OF THE SPARKS OF THE MODERN CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT
POD1000000016_S0000256	THE SECOND SUSTAINED MOVEMENT OF BLACK PEOPLE TRYING TO SECURE EQUAL RIGHTS BEFORE THE LAW AND EQUAL PLACE IN THIS DEMOCRACY
POD1000000016_S0000258	AND IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF THE FIRST ENSLAVED AFRICANS INTO THE COLONIES
POD1000000016_S0000260	CONGRESS PASSES THE LAST OF THE GREAT CIVIL RIGHTS LEGISLATION
POD1000000016_S0000262	IT ENDS LEGAL DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF RACE FROM ALL ASPECTS OF AMERICAN LIFE
POD1000000016_S0000264	WE OFTEN THINK OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AS BEING ABOUT BLACK RIGHTS BUT THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT WAS NEVER JUST ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF BLACK PEOPLE IT WAS ABOUT MAKING THE IDEALS OF THE CONSTITUTION WHOLE
POD1000000016_S0000265	AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LAWS BORN OUT OF BLACK RESISTANCE THESE LAWS ARE GUARANTEEING RIGHTS FOR ALL AMERICANS
POD1000000016_S0000266	THIS EXPERIENCE WHICH BLACK AMERICANS WERE HAVING DID NOT GO UNNOTICED BY THE REST OF AMERICA
POD1000000016_S0000267	I MEAN BASICALLY EVERY OTHER RIGHTS STRUGGLE THAT WE HAVE SEEN
POD1000000016_S0000269	DISABILITY RIGHTS GAY RIGHTS WOMEN'S RIGHTS
POD1000000016_S0000270	PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WERE STILL VICTIMS OF SEGREGATION AND DISCRIMINATION
POD1000000016_S0000271	ALL COME FROM THE EFFORTS OF THE BLACK CIVIL RIGHTS STRUGGLE
POD1000000016_S0000274	SO WE ARE RAISED TO THINK ABOUT SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SIX AS THE BEGINNING OF OUR DEMOCRACY BUT WHEN THAT SHIP ARRIVES ON THE HORIZON AT POINT COMFORT IN SIXTEEN NINETEEN
POD1000000016_S0000275	THAT DECISION MADE BY THE COLONISTS TO PURCHASE THAT GROUP OF TWENTY TO THIRTY HUMAN BEINGS THAT WAS A BEGINNING TOO
POD1000000016_S0000276	AND IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE THOSE VERY PEOPLE WHO WERE DENIED CITIZENSHIP IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY WHO WERE DENIED THE PROTECTIONS OF OUR FOUNDING DOCUMENTS WHO WOULD FIGHT THE HARDEST AND MOST SUCCESSFULLY TO MAKE THOSE IDEALS REAL
POD1000000016_S0000277	NOT JUST FOR THEMSELVES BUT FOR ALL AMERICANS IT IS BLACK PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN THE PERFECT ORS OF THIS DEMOCRACY
POD1000000016_S0000279	WHEN I WAS A KID I MUST HAVE BEEN IN FIFTH OR SIXTH GRADE OUR TEACHER GAVE US AN ASSIGNMENT IT WAS A SOCIAL STUDIES CLASS AND WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT DIFFERENT PLACES THAT PEOPLE CAME FROM
POD1000000016_S0000280	THIS WAS HER WAY OF KIND OF TELLING THE STORY OF THE GREAT AMERICAN MELTING POT SO SHE TOLD US ALL TO RESEARCH OUR ANCESTRAL LAND AND TO WRITE A SMALL REPORT ABOUT IT AND THEN TO DRAW FLAG
POD1000000016_S0000281	I REMEMBER KIND OF LOOKING UP AND MAKING EYE CONTACT WITH THE OTHER BLACK GIRL WHO WAS IN THE CLASS BECAUSE WE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE AN ANCESTRAL LAND THAT WE KNEW OF
POD1000000016_S0000282	SLAVERY HAD MADE IT SO THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE WE CAME FROM IN AFRICA WE DIDN'T HAVE A SPECIFIC COUNTRY AND WE COULD SAY THAT WE WERE FROM THE WHOLE CONTINENT
POD1000000016_S0000283	BUT EVEN SO THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS AN AFRICAN FLAG AND SO I REMEMBER GOING TO THE GLOBE BY MY TEACHER'S DESK IT WAS ON THE WINDOW PANE ALONG THE LEFT SIDE OF THE CLASSROOM
POD1000000016_S0000284	AND SPINNING IT TO THE CONTINENT OF AFRICA AND JUST PICKING A RANDOM AFRICAN COUNTRY
POD1000000016_S0000285	SO I WENT BACK TO MY DESK AND I DREW THAT RANDOM AFRICAN COUNTRIES FLAG AND I WROTE A REPORT ABOUT IT AND I FELT ASHAMED I FELT ASHAMED ONE BECAUSE I WAS LYING
POD1000000016_S0000286	BUT I ALSO FELT ASHAMED BECAUSE I FELT LIKE I SHOULD HAVE SOME OTHER COUNTRY AND THAT ALL THE OTHER KIDS COULD TRACE THEIR ROOTS ELSEWHERE AND I COULD ONLY TRACE MY ROOTS TO THE COUNTRY THAT HAD ENSLAVED US
POD1000000016_S0000287	I WISH NOW THAT I COULD GO BACK AND TALK TO MY YOUNGER SELF AND TELL HER THAT SHE SHOULD NOT BE ASHAMED
POD1000000016_S0000288	THAT THIS IS HER ANCESTRAL HOME THAT SHE SHOULD BE AS PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN AS HER DAD WAS
POD1000000016_S0000289	AND THAT SHE SHOULD BOLDLY AND PROUDLY DRAW THOSE STARS AND STRIPES AND CLAIM THIS COUNTRY AS HER OWN
POD1000000019_S0000000	THIS EPISODE OF COCAINE AND RHINESTONES IS THE SECOND EPISODE IN A THREE PART SERIES ON HARPER VALLEY PTA
POD1000000019_S0000001	IF THIS IS THE FIRST EPISODE OF THE PODCAST YOU'RE LISTENING TO I WOULD RECOMMEND GOING BACK AND AT LEAST LISTENING TO LAST WEEK'S EPISODE BEFORE THIS ONE EVEN IF YOU'RE JUST A HUGE GENE CRILLY FAN AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO SHELBY SINGLETON IS
POD1000000019_S0000002	IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD LAST WEEK'S EPISODE YOU'LL BE MISSING OUT ON A LOT OF CONTEXT AND I'M NOT GOING TO BE DOING VERY MUCH RECAPPING
POD1000000019_S0000004	LAST WEEK WE SPENT SOME TIME LOOKING AT HOW FAR OUTSIDE OF THE BOX SHELBY SINGLETON WAS WILLING TO GO FOR A HIT SONG NOW ARE WE SURE WE KNOW WHAT A HIT SONG IS HOW TO DEFINE IT
POD1000000019_S0000006	IT'S SAFE TO SAY ANY SONG THAT HITS THE TOP TEN COULD BE CALLED A HIT RIGHT OKAY THIS PAST MAY WHEN I BEGAN WORKING ON THIS PODCAST I SPENT ABOUT A WEEK LISTENING TO EVERY SONG TO EVER GO NUMBER ONE ON THE BILLBOARD COUNTRY CHARTS
POD1000000019_S0000007	IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER FROM THE FIRST YEAR THE CHART EXISTED IN NINETEEN FORTY FOUR UNTIL THIS SHOWS CUTOFF POINT IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND
POD1000000019_S0000008	I NEEDED TO MAKE SURE I'D HEARD THEM ALL TO BUILD A TIMELINE OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE MAINSTREAM OF COUNTRY MUSIC IN THE NINETEEN HUNDREDS THERE WERE QUITE A FEW SONGS I'D NEVER HEARD BEFORE
POD1000000019_S0000009	UNLESS YOU'VE PURPOSEFULLY SAT DOWN TO GIVE YOURSELF THE SAME EXPERIENCE OR SPENT THE PAST SEVENTY SOMETHING YEARS OF YOUR LIFE GLUED TO COUNTRY RADIO THE SAME THING IS TRUE FOR YOU NUMBER ONE SONGS HIT SONGS COMPLETELY ABSENT FROM OUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF COUNTRY MUSIC
POD1000000019_S0000010	EVEN WHEN THE SONG AT NUMBER ONE THE WEEK BEFORE OR THE WEEK AFTER IS ONE OF OUR FAVORITE SONGS OF ALL TIME NOW IMAGINE HOW MANY TOP TEN HITS BETWEEN NINETEEN FORTY FOUR AND THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND WE HAVEN'T HEARD
POD1000000019_S0000011	PROBABLY HUNDREDS OF HIT COUNTRY SONGS YOU'VE NEVER HEARD IN YOUR LIFE I'VE NEVER HEARD IN MY LIFE SO WE CAN SAY ALL HITS ARE NOT CREATED EQUAL NOT IN THE MIND OF THE AUDIENCE AND DEFINITELY NOT IN THE MIND OF THE RECORD INDUSTRY
POD1000000019_S0000012	I SHOULD GIVE A DISCLAIMER HERE THAT COMMERCIAL SUCCESS IS OBVIOUSLY NOT EVERYTHING OBVIOUSLY NOT A GAUGE OF ARTISTIC MERIT
POD1000000019_S0000013	THERE ARE BRILLIANT COUNTRY ARTISTS WHO'VE NEVER HAD A HIT IN THEIR LIVES THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY
POD1000000019_S0000014	BUT IF WE'RE SAYING TOP TEN SINGLES ARE HITS AND I BELIEVE WE SHOULD SAY THAT THEN JUST HAVING IT WASN'T ENOUGH FOR THIS INDUSTRY YOU HAD TO HAVE MORE HITS BIGGER HITS IT WAS CALLED THE RECORD INDUSTRY
POD1000000019_S0000015	MOVE UNITS MAKE MONEY OR GET OUT OF THE WAY FOR THE NEXT ARTIST WHO WILL ALWAYS BE SCALING UP ANYTHING THAT ISN'T AS GOOD AS OR BETTER THAN THE LAST THING YOU DID
POD1000000019_S0000016	YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE NOT DONE IT AND YOU'LL PROBABLY END UP WISHING YOU HADN'T
POD1000000019_S0000017	I THINK THE WORST THING THAT COULD HAPPEN TO A COUNTRY RECORDING ARTIST IN THIS CLIMATE IS FOR THEIR VERY FIRST SINGLE TO BECOME A NUMBER ONE HIT YOU CAN'T DO ANY BETTER THAN THAT THE ONLY WAY TO IMPROVE ON THAT IS TO STAY NUMBER ONE FOR MORE WEEKS
POD1000000019_S0000018	SELL MORE COPIES EVEN IF YOU MANAGE TO DO THAT IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME UNTIL YOU PUT OUT A SONG THAT ONLY GOES TO NUMBER TWO OR NUMBER FIVE
POD1000000019_S0000019	BUT THAT'S STILL OH SURE SURE IT IS OR MAYBE IT'S THE BEGINNING OF THE END MAYBE YOU JUST DON'T HAVE THE STUFF ANYMORE KEDO WE GOTTA GET THOSE NUMBERS BACK UP TO WHERE THEY WERE OR WELL IT AIN'T GONNA BE GOOD
POD1000000019_S0000020	IMAGINE YOU'RE A NEW COUNTRY ARTIST AND YOUR VERY FIRST SINGLE GOES NUMBER ONE COUNTRY AND POP HOW SCREWED DO YOU THINK YOU ARE THERE AREN'T MANY PEOPLE YOU CAN ASK ABOUT THIS
POD1000000019_S0000021	BILLY SWAN IS ONE GENE C REILLY THE SINGER OF HARPER VALLEY PCA IS THE OTHER ONE THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE ALIVE WHO'VE HAD THEIR FIRST SINGLE GO NUMBER ONE COUNTRY AND POP
POD1000000019_S0000022	NEITHER ONE OF THEM EVER HAD ANOTHER NUMBER ONE SONG
POD1000000019_S0000024	I'VE HEARD THEM BOTH CALLED ONE HIT WONDERS
POD1000000019_S0000025	BILLY SWAN NEVER EVEN GOT BACK IN THE TOP TEN ALTHOUGH HE DID ALSO WRITE HIS ONE HIT I CAN HELP AND ELVIS PRESLEY RECORDED THAT SO I ASSUME BILL'S DOING FINE
POD1000000019_S0000027	RILEY PUT OUT FIVE MORE TOP TEN HITS FOUR OF WHICH CROSSED OVER INTO THE BILLBOARD HOT ONE HUNDRED THESE ARE COUNTRY SONGS BY THE WAY
POD1000000019_S0000028	NONE OF THAT STRIPPED DOWN NASHVILLE SOUND STUFF THE INDUSTRY BENT OVER BACKWARDS TO PUSH IT POP AUDIENCES JEANEY WAS ACHIEVING CROSSOVER SUCCESS WITH ONE OF THE MOST UNSOPHISTICATED TEXAS TWANGS YOU'VE EVER HEARD
POD1000000019_S0000029	AND A HARDCORE COUNTRY SOUND BEHIND IT THAT'S NOT WHAT ONE HIT WONDERS DO BECAUSE YOU'RE FINE
POD1000000019_S0000031	BECAUSE HER FIRST SINGLE SOLD MAYBE SIX MILLION RECORDS
POD1000000019_S0000032	NOTHING SHE DID AFTER THAT MATTERED
POD1000000019_S0000034	JEANIE CAROLYN STEVENSON WAS BORN IN A SMALL TEXAS TOWN IN NINETEEN FORTY FIVE IN NINETEEN SIXTY TWO WHILE STILL A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL SHE MARRIED HER BOYFRIEND MICKEY RILEY AND BECAME JEANIE CAROLYN RILEY SO STANDS FOR CAROLYN
POD1000000019_S0000035	HER UNCLE WAS A COUNTRY GUITAR PLAYER AND SONGWRITER NOBODY YOU'D KNOW BUT IN THE TINY TOWN OF ANSIN TEXAS JUST THE FACT THAT HE'D GONE TO NASHVILLE TO RECORD IN A REAL STUDIO WAS A BIG DEAL
POD1000000019_S0000036	OR AT LEAST JANE SEEMS TO THINK PEOPLE THOUGHT SO HER HUSBAND MICKE KNEW IT WAS JANE'S DREAM TO MOVE TO NASHVILLE AND BECOME A FAMOUS SINGER HE WAS SUPPORTIVE OF THAT
POD1000000019_S0000037	BUT THEY DECIDED TO WAIT UNTIL JENNY FINISHED HIGH SCHOOL AND SAVE SOME MONEY FOR THE MOVE THEN JENNY FOUND OUT SHE WAS PREGNANT AND THEY HAD A BABY IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX
POD1000000019_S0000038	YES THAT IS FOUR YEARS AFTER THEY GOT MARRIED AND UNLESS IT TOOK JEANNE FOUR YEARS TO PASS TWELFTH GRADE THE MATH DOESN'T ADD UP AT ALL FOR HER TO USE THE BABY AS AN EXCUSE FOR WHY THEY STAYED IN TEXAS I'LL GET TO IT IN A SECOND
POD1000000019_S0000040	ONE DAY JANE SAYS SHE GETS A LETTER FROM THE GREAT PEDAL STEEL PLAYER WELDEN MIRICK WHO'D SEEN HER SING AT A LOCAL JAMBOREE AND JUST HAD TO WRITE HER TO SAY THAT HE THOUGHT OF JEAN'S SINGING EVERY TIME HE HEARD CONNIE SMITH SING
POD1000000019_S0000041	ONCE A DAY

POD1000000019_S0000051	JEAN RILEY'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY IS REALLY THE ONLY SOURCE I CAN USE FOR THIS STUFF AND IT'S SUPER SKETCHY TO SAY THE LEAST
POD1000000019_S0000052	THIS IS THE FIRST OF SEVERAL OUTLANDISH SCENARIOS WHERE FAMOUS PEOPLE GIVE HER INCREDIBLY PERSONAL ADVICE THAT IS ALSO SO EXTREMELY SPECIFIC
POD1000000019_S0000053	IT'S ALMOST AS IF THEY CAN SEE INTO JENNY'S ACTUAL FUTURE MERE MOMENTS AFTER MEETING HER FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME
POD1000000019_S0000054	YOU'RE A PROFESSIONAL MUSICIAN A COLLEAGUE OF YOURS BRINGS HIS NIECE TO SEE A SHOW YOU TAKE IT UPON YOURSELF TO CALL THE GUY ASIDE AND TELL HIM TO MAKE SURE TO LET HIS NIECE KNOW NOT TO BE A HOOKER NOT LIKELY
POD1000000019_S0000055	JANE DOES GO ON TO FIND HERSELF IN SOME BAD SITUATIONS AND I DON'T DOUBT FOR A SECOND THAT THEY REALLY HAPPENED BUT BELIEVING HER ABOUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN I HAVE TO BELIEVE EVERYTHING ELSE SHE SAYS
POD1000000019_S0000056	HE'S ALL THESE RUN INS WITH CELEBRITIES WHO SEEM TO HAVE PSYCHIC POWERS THE TIMELINE SHE PRESENTS OFTEN MAKES NO SENSE FINE BUT AT LEAST ONE MAJOR PART OF HER STORY IS DELIBERATELY MISREPRESENTED
POD1000000019_S0000057	SHE IS BLATANTLY LYING ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS THERE'S EVEN A NOTE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK ABOUT HOW SEVERAL NAMES AND SOME DETAILS HAVE BEEN CHANGED TO PROTECT PEOPLE
POD1000000019_S0000059	BASICALLY IT COULD NOT BE MORE CLEAR THAT THIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY IS MORE LIKE WHAT YOU'D CALL AN AUTO HAGIOGRAPHY THE HOLLYWOOD MOVIE VERSION OF THESE EVENTS
POD1000000019_S0000060	THEY MIGHT AS WELL HAVE PRINTED BASED ON A TRUE STORY ON THE TITLE PAGE I SHOULD SAY THIS IS ONE OF THOSE CELEBRITY AUTOBIOGRAPHIES THAT'S WRITTEN WITH THE HELP OF AN AUTHOR SO YOU KNOW IT'S POSSIBLE THIS GUY HAD A HAND IN THESE EMBELLISHMENTS
POD1000000019_S0000061	YOU CAN MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND THAT'S WHAT I'LL SAY BUT THIS IS GONNA GET REAL CRAZY SO JUST PLEASE TRY TO REMEMBER THIS
POD1000000019_S0000062	HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF A SMALL TYPE OF THING THAT I PROBABLY WOULDN'T EVEN MENTION IF I ONLY NOTICED IT ONCE OR TWICE THE BOOK OPENS WITH HER LOCKING UP THE OFFICE BUILDING IN NASHVILLE WHERE SHE WORKED AS A SECRETARY

POD1000000019_S0000065	IN THE VERY NEXT PARAGRAPH SHE SAYS SHE'D ALREADY STUDIED THE LYRICS WHICH SHE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN FROM SHELBY WHY DOES SHE HAVE SHELBY PRESENTING THE LYRICS TO HER HERE WITH SUCH POMP AS IF FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME
POD1000000019_S0000066	AS IF SHE'S NEVER HEARD THIS SONG BEFORE LIKE I SAID SMALL THING I WOULD LET IT SLIDE BUT THIS IS A DEATH BY A THOUSAND CUTS SITUATION
POD1000000019_S0000067	THERE'S AT LEAST ONE SCENE WHERE TWO PEOPLE GO BACK AND FORTH WITH LINES OF QUOTED DIALOGUE IN A CONVERSATION THAT JENNY WAS NOT THERE FOR AND COULD NOT POSSIBLY REMEMBER WITH SUCH DETAIL EVEN IF SHE WAS BLESSED WITH TOTAL RECALL OVER A DECADE AFTER THE FACT
POD1000000019_S0000069	THERE'S ONE MORE SCENE WHERE SHE'S DRIVING HER CAR WHILE UPSET QUOTE HALF BLIND FROM THE TEARS SHE ACCIDENTALLY SPEEDS OVER SOME RAILROAD TRACKS JUST AHEAD OF A CROSSING TRAIN AND I'M QUOTING HERE

POD1000000019_S0000127	I COULDN'T FIND A RECORDING OF JEANEY SINGING IT BUT I FOUND THE SONGWRITER SINGING IT HIMSELF SO YOU CAN TRY TO IMAGINE WHAT JENNY WOULD HAVE SOUNDED LIKE ON THE DEMO
POD1000000019_S0000128	CLARK BENTLEY'S OLD TOWN DRUNK COMES OUT ON PLANTATION RECORDS IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT
POD1000000019_S0000130	WHEN SHELBY HEARS THE DEMO HE'S MORE INTERESTED IN THE VOICE OF THE SINGER THAN THE SONG IF YOU LISTEN TO LAST WEEK'S EPISODE THIS IS THE PART WHERE HE WANTS TO MEET THAT SINGER TO SEE IF SHE'S GOT THE IMAGE HE'S LOOKING FOR TO SING HARPER VALLEY PTA
POD1000000019_S0000132	HERE ON GENE'S SIDE SHE WANTS TO LISTEN TO HARPER VALLEY PTA BEFORE SHE AGREES TO ANYTHING HER MANAGER PAUL PERRY THINK SHE'S CRAZY FOR NOT GETTING ON BOARD SIGHT UNSEEN BUT HE BRINGS HER A TAPE SHE DOESN'T LIKE THE SONG

POD1000000019_S0000139	STILL SHE GOES TO THE STUDIO CHANNELS HER ANGER INTO THE SONG AND NAILS IT ON THE SECOND TAPE
POD1000000019_S0000141	SHELBY TELLS JENNY THEY'LL USE HER MIDDLE INITIAL TO MAKE HER STAND OUT MORE FROM THE OTHER GENES AND ADD AN EYE TO HER FIRST NAME SO PEOPLE KNOW IT'S NOT PRONOUNCED GENE
POD1000000019_S0000142	FINDING OUT SHE REALLY DOESN'T HAVE TO BE RHONDA RENEE PLUS THE FACT THAT EVERYONE IN THE ROOM SEEMS CERTAIN SHE JUST CAUGHT A MASSIVE HIT SONG IMPROVES JENNY'S MOOD

POD1000000019_S0000160	THEY ARGUE SHE DEMANDS THE NAKED PICTURES HE PLAYS STUPID AT FIRST BUT THEN SAYS IT'LL TAKE HIM A COUPLE DAYS TO GET THEM COME BACK WEDNESDAY SKIP TO WEDNESDAY
POD1000000019_S0000161	BLACK MAN'S GOT A MANILA ENVELOPE LIKE YOU SEE IN EVERY MOVIE ABOUT A PRIVATE DETECTIVE AND HE WANTS TO GIVE IT TO JEANEY BUT FIRST SHE'S GOT TO SIGN A NEW PIECE OF PAPER SAYING SHE WON'T SUE HIM FOR RELEASING HER OLD RECORDINGS
POD1000000019_S0000162	SEE HE'S LEGALLY ALLOWED TO DO THAT AND SHE'LL EVEN GET PAID ROYALTIES AND EVERYTHING IT'S JUST THAT HE LOST THEIR ORIGINAL CONTRACT SO SIGN HERE AND HERE AND YOU CAN HAVE THOSE PICTURES
POD1000000019_S0000163	OF COURSE SHE SIGNS THE THING THEN WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT THE MANILA ENVELOPE SHE ASKS HIM TO BURN IT WHICH HE DOES IN FRONT OF HER BY THE TIME SHE GETS HOME
POD1000000019_S0000164	HALF AN HOUR LATER THE NEWS IS REPORTING THAT BLACK ROSE RECORDS HAS FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST HARPER VALLEY PTA SINGER AND RECORD LABEL FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT
POD1000000019_S0000165	OKAY HERE'S THE THING PHIL BLACKMAN AND AUDREY MAYHUE ARE AT LEAST PARTIALLY THE SAME PERSON
POD1000000019_S0000166	YOU DO REMEMBER AUBREY RIGHT JOHNNY PAYCHECK PRODUCER THAT HEARD JANE SING IN VEGAS WANTED TO RECORD HER AND THAT'S WHY SHE GOT BLACKMAN TO LET HER OUT OF HER CONTRACT IN THE FIRST PLACE
POD1000000019_S0000167	YEAH THAT'S ALL BULLSHIT
POD1000000019_S0000168	PHIL BLACKMAN AND BLACK ROSE RECORDS ARE NOT FAKE NAMES FOR SOMEONE AND SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED BEFORE JENNY GOT INVOLVED WITH AUDREY MAYHUE AND LITTLE DARLIN
POD1000000019_S0000169	TELL THE SAME STORY TWO DIFFERENT WAYS AS A RED HERRING BLACK ROSE RECORDS IS LITTLE DARLIN RECORDS
POD1000000019_S0000170	WHICH IS ALSO THE EXPLANATION FOR WHY JENNY WOULD BE IN LAS VEGAS OPENING UP FOR JOHNNY PAYCHECK WHEN ALL SHE'S SUPPOSEDLY DONE IS ONE BARELY RELEASED SINGLE FOR BLACK ROSE RECORDS
POD1000000019_S0000171	IF YOU WERE TO REWIND THIS EPISODE AND LISTEN TO THE PART ABOUT HOW PHIL BLACKMAN CAME INTO JEANEY C RILEY'S LIFE YOU'D BE LISTENING TO THE STORY OF HOW AUDREY MAYHUE CAME INTO HER LIFE
POD1000000019_S0000172	YOU'D BE LISTENING TO THE STORY OF HOW JANE REILEY CAME TO BE SIGNED TO LITTLE DARWIN RECORDS
POD1000000019_S0000173	I KNOW THIS BECAUSE IT'S DESCRIBED EXACTLY THE SAME WAY IN COURT DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE LAWSUIT JENNY JUST TOLD US ABOUT
POD1000000019_S0000174	QUOTE AS TO LITTLE DARLIN RECORDS THE AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL BILL ASSERTS THAT PRIOR TO THE TIME COMPLAINANT WAS INCORPORATED ITS PRESIDENT AUDREY MAYHUE DID BUSINESS IN NEW YORK NEW YORK
POD1000000019_S0000175	AS AN INDIVIDUAL UNDER THE PROPRIETARY NAME OF LITTLE DARLIN RECORDS THAT HIS FIRST KNOWLEDGE OF DEFENDANT RILEY WAS A LETTER ADDRESSED TO HIM ON THE DATE OF DECEMBER EIGHT NINETEEN SIXTY SIX BY PAUL PERRY
POD1000000019_S0000176	ENCLOSING THE TAPE AND PHOTO MENTIONED
POD1000000019_S0000177	THERE WAS NO BARELY RELEASED BLACK ROSE SINGLE BEFORE THE BARELY RELEASED LITTLE DARLIN SINGLE THERE WAS ONE BARELY RELEASED SINGLE
POD1000000019_S0000178	THE CONTRACT DIFFICULTIES GENIE MENTIONS TO EXPLAIN WHY HER LITTLE DARLIN SINGLE SUFFERED THE SAME FATE AS HER BLACK ROSE SINGLE THAT'S THIS LAWSUIT THE COURT DOCUMENT SHEDS MORE LIGHT ON THIS
POD1000000019_S0000179	IN RESPONSE TO MAYHUE LAWSUIT JENNY TELLS THE COURT THAT MAYHUE WAS NEVER CONVINCED SHE HAD ENOUGH TALENT TO SUCCEED AS A RECORDING ARTIST
POD1000000019_S0000180	DID NOT UNDERTAKE TO PRODUCE ANY RECORDS OF HER VOICE FOR GENERAL DISTRIBUTION
POD1000000019_S0000181	IN OTHER WORDS AUBREY MAHEU DIDN'T THINK JANE WAS THAT GOOD OF A SINGER HE WAS USING HER AS LITTLE MORE THAN A SESSION VOCALIST FOR DEMO TAPES HE NEEDED DONE ANYWAY WHILE LETTING HER BELIEVE SHE WAS A REAL RECORDING ARTIST
POD1000000019_S0000182	JENNY SEEMS TO THINK THAT ONE SINGLE WAS JUST HIM GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS TO STRING HER ALONG AND SHE'S PROBABLY RIGHT
POD1000000019_S0000183	SPEAKING VERY STRICTLY HARPER VALLEY PTA IS NOT HER DEBUT SINGLE AS I SAID IT WAS IN THE INTRO OF THIS EPISODE BUT HER FIRST SINGLE MAY NEVER HAVE BEEN MEANT FOR AN AUDIENCE LARGER THAN HER IMMEDIATE CIRCLE OF FAMILY AND FRIENDS
POD1000000019_S0000184	SOMETHING PHYSICAL FOR GENE TO PLAY PRETEND WITH TO KEEP THE WHOLE CHARADE GOING IT WAS CALLED YOU WRITE THE MUSIC CREDITED TO GEAN RILEY QUOTE UNQUOTE RELEASED ON LITTLE DARLIN RECORDS IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN
POD1000000019_S0000186	AUBREY'S FIRST MISTAKE WAS SIGNING JENNY TO A REAL RECORDING CONTRACT WHICH STIPULATED THAT SHE BE RECORDED FOUR TIMES A YEAR A STIPULATION NOT MET BY USING HER FOR DEMO SESSIONS
POD1000000019_S0000187	HIS SECOND MISTAKE WAS RELEASING HER FROM HER CONTRACT ON APRIL THIRD OF NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT FOUR MONTHS BEFORE SHE RECORDED HARPER VALLEY PTA
POD1000000019_S0000188	NOW HERE ARE THE TWO BIG QUESTIONS I DON'T THINK I CAN OR SHOULD EVEN TRY TO ANSWER DID AUBREY MAYHUE AND JEANEY CRILLY HAVE AN AFFAIR
POD1000000019_S0000189	AND DID ARE MAYHUE TAKE NAKED PHOTOGRAPHS OF GENIC RILEY WITHOUT HER CONSENT AND THEN BLACKMAIL HER
POD1000000019_S0000190	TECHNICALLY JEANEY HAS NEVER ALLEGED EITHER OF THESE THINGS AGAINST AUBREY MAYHUE
POD1000000019_S0000191	THAT WAS PHIL BLACKMAN I'M GOING TO PLAY IT SAFE AND POINT OUT THAT IT'S POSSIBLE PHIL BLACKMAN IS MEANT AS AN AMALGAMATION OF MORE THAN ONE PERSON
POD1000000019_S0000192	I'M NOT IN ANY WAY A PROFESSIONAL INVESTIGATOR ALL I DID WAS READ A BUNCH OF PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION AND MATCH IT TO WHAT JENNY WROTE IN HER BOOK
POD1000000019_S0000193	AS FAR AS I CAN TELL I'M THE FIRST READER OF JANE'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY WHO CARED ENOUGH TO TAKE THE TIME TO LOOK INTO THIS OR AT LEAST I'M THE FIRST ONE TO TALK ABOUT IT
POD1000000019_S0000194	SEARCHING JENNY AND AUBREY'S NAMES TOGETHER ONLY BRINGS UP INFORMATION ABOUT THEM HAVING WORKED TOGETHER AND INFORMATION ABOUT THIS LAWSUIT BUT LISTEN EVEN IF PHIL BLACKMAN IS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT ARE MAYHUE
POD1000000019_S0000195	AND EVEN IF WE CHOOSE TO ONE HUNDRED PERCENT BELIEVE EVERYTHING JENNY SAYS ABOUT HIM THAT STILL DOESN'T MEAN AUBREY MAYHUE TOOK THOSE PICTURES JANE SAYS SHE HAD HIM BURN THE ENVELOPE WITHOUT LOOKING INSIDE
POD1000000019_S0000196	SHE EVEN BRINGS UP THE POSSIBILITY HERSELF THAT THE ENVELOPE COULD HAVE BEEN EMPTY
POD1000000019_S0000197	IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ANY PORNOGRAPHIC PHOTOGRAPHS WERE MENTIONED IN THE COURTROOM AT ALL
POD1000000019_S0000198	THE CASE WAS RULED IN FAVOUR OF SHELBY SINGLETON AND JENNY CRILLY
POD1000000019_S0000199	BACK IN THE BUSINESS OF PROMOTING THEIR HIT SINGLE GENE GETS SENT TO CHARM SCHOOL TO LEARN HOW TO WALK TALK AND ACT ON STAGE
POD1000000019_S0000200	THEN SHE'S SENT ON TOUR CONCERTS TALK SHOWS RADIO SHOWS LIVE TV APPEARANCES HER HOMETOWN NAMES A DAY IN APRIL JEANEY CRILLY DAY AND THERE'S A BIG CEREMONY FOR THAT
POD1000000019_S0000201	SHE GETS TO PICK WILD MOUNTAIN BERRIES WITH GLEN CAMPBELL ON TV
POD1000000019_S0000203	SHE GETS TO LIVE HER DREAM OF PERFORMING ON THE GRAND OPERA
POD1000000019_S0000205	BUT THEN SHE GETS HER FIRST ROYALTY CHECK AND FINDS OUT HOW MUCH OF THE MONEY BEING SPENT IS HERS BASICALLY ALL OF IT SHE'S ALWAYS EXPECTED TO HANG OUT AND BE NICE TO INDUSTRY PEOPLE
POD1000000019_S0000206	ONE NIGHT THERE'S A SCENE WITH MICKE WHEN A RANDOM SUIT AT A PARTY IS TOO PERSISTENT IN TRYING TO GET GENE TO DANCE WITH HIM MICKIE GRABS THE GUY'S WRIST AND TELLS HIM TO BACK OFF
POD1000000019_S0000207	LATER SHE TELLS GENE THAT MICKE NEEDS TO STAY HOME IF HE CAN'T CONTROL HIMSELF AND MICKE IS BANISHED FROM THE ROAD
POD1000000019_S0000208	IF YOU'RE STARTING TO GET THE IDEA THAT JEANNE'S ALWAYS THOUGHT OF AS LITTLE MORE THAN A PUPPET FOR THE PEOPLE BEHIND THE SCENES OF HER CAREER I WOULD SAY THAT SEEMS ACCURATE
POD1000000019_S0000210	NOW ASIDE FROM THE SONG ITSELF THE BIGGEST IMPACT JEANEY RILEY HAD ON COUNTRY MUSIC WITH HARPER VALLEY PTA WAS IN FASHION
POD1000000019_S0000212	IT SEEMS RIDICULOUS TODAY BUT IN THE LATE SIXTY S THAT LINE IN THE SONG ABOUT THE SINGLE MOTHER WEARING MINISKIRTS THAT IN ITSELF WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE A LOT OF COUNTRY MUSIC FANS GASP AND TURN OFF THE RADIO
POD1000000019_S0000213	AND WHILE THE SONG IS ACTUALLY SUNG BY THE DAUGHTER CHARACTER WHO DOESN'T DRESS THAT WAY EVERY TIME YOU SEE JEANEY CRILLY SHE LOOKS LIKE MRS JOHNSON
POD1000000019_S0000215	HER STYLE OR MORE ACCURATELY THE STYLE SHE WAS MADE TO WEAR WOULD BEST BE DESCRIBED AS MAD LIKE NANCY SINATRA IN HER BOOTS ARE MADE FOR WALKING PHASE
POD1000000019_S0000216	WAY BEFORE ANY OTHER WOMEN IN COUNTRY MUSIC WERE DRESSING THAT WAY WE'RE TALKING MINISKIRTS GO GO BOOTS AND IN OCTOBER OF NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT THE FIRST YEAR THE CMA AWARDS WERE TELEVISED
POD1000000019_S0000217	A RIDICULOUS DRESS
POD1000000019_S0000219	THE RUFFLES START HALFWAY UP HER RIB CAGE AND POOF WAY OUT LIKE THEY WOULD TO MAKE A BELL SHAPE DOWN TO THE GROUND BUT THEN IT ALL JUST STOPS HALFWAY DOWN HER THIGHS SHOWING OFF LEGS AND HIGH HEEL COWGIRL BOOTS
POD1000000019_S0000221	AFTER SEEING THE DRESS BUT BEFORE THE SHOW SHE CALLED SHELBY SINGLETON TO YELL AT HIM IN THE MIDDLE OF HER TIRADE AFTER SHE TELLS HIM SHE'S NOT MISS HARPER VALLEY PTA
POD1000000019_S0000222	SHE'S AN ARTIST SHELBY CUT HER OFF TO SAY YOU'RE NOT AN ARTIST BABY YOU'RE A COMMODITY A MINI SKIRTED SILVER BOOTED COMMODITY NOW BE THERE EARLY WE'VE GOT A SHOW TO REHEARSE
POD1000000019_S0000223	THAT'S ONE EXCHANGE THAT I DON'T DOUBT FOR A SECOND HAPPENED JUST LIKE THAT
POD1000000019_S0000225	THE REST OF JENNY'S BOOK IS ABOUT HER STRUGGLES WITH INFIDELITY AND CONVERSION TO RELIGION MORE PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE MYSTICAL PSYCHIC POWERS
POD1000000019_S0000226	LIKE AFTER A DIVORCE FROM MICKY A RANDOM SALES CLERK IN A DEPARTMENT STORE SOMEWHERE STOPS JENNY TO SAY YOUR EX HUSBAND STILL LOVES YOU GOD WANTS YOU TO GO BACK TO HIM BULLSHIT LIKE THAT
POD1000000019_S0000227	SHE TELLS THE STORY OF THE FIRST TIME SHE TRIES POD HAVING AN INTENSELY SPIRITUAL VISION THAT SENDS HER INTO A FUGUE STATE FOR CLOSE TO TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND SOUNDS MORE LIKE AN IOWASKA TRIP THAN ANY WEED I'VE EVER SMOKED
POD1000000019_S0000228	FROM THE NIGHTMARE SHE DESCRIBES YOU'D EXPECT THAT TO BE THE ONLY TIME SHE EVER CHOKED UP BUT THIS VIDEO CLIP OF RALPH EMMERY INTERVIEWING HER SEEMS TO SUGGEST OTHERWISE
POD1000000019_S0000230	SO I WANT TO GET AWAY FROM HER AUTOBIOGRAPHY FOR THE REST OF THIS EPISODE AND TALK MORE ABOUT THE MUSIC JENNY MADE AFTER HER HIT BECAUSE THAT LAST SENTENCE IS PRETTY TYPICAL OF THE WAY PEOPLE TALK ABOUT JANE RILEY'S CAREER
POD1000000019_S0000231	REFERENCE TO HER HIT AS IF SHE HAD ONLY ONE A ONE HIT WONDER IF YOU WILL
POD1000000019_S0000233	WHILE IT'S TRUE SHE NEVER TOOK ANOTHER SONG TO NUMBER ONE ON BOTH POP AND COUNTRY CHARTS NOT MANY PEOPLE HAVE EVER DONE THAT
POD1000000019_S0000234	THE ONLY OTHER WOMAN TO DO THAT IN THE NINETEEN HUNDREDS IS DOLLY PARTON WITH NINETY FIVE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE MAKING JEANEY THE FIRST WOMAN TO EVER DO IT IF YOU DON'T COUNT THE FARCE WITH LITTLE DARLIN RECORD
POD1000000019_S0000235	WHICH YOU SHOULD NOT SHE'S THE ONLY WOMAN TO DO IT WITH HER DEBUT SINGLE IT'S SO UNFAIR TO JUDGE THE REST OF HER OUTPUT AGAINST THAT THAT'S LIKE MOCKING A ROOKIE BASKETBALL PLAYER FOR ONLY BREAKING A WORLD RECORD ONE TIME
POD1000000019_S0000236	JENNY'S FOLLOW UP SINGLE TO HARPER VALLEY PTA WAS CALLED THE GIRL MOST LIKELY
POD1000000019_S0000237	STICKING WITH THE FORMULA IT'S ANOTHER SONG ABOUT PREJUDICE IN A SMALL TOWN THIS TIME IT'S THE GIRL WHO EVERYONE THOUGHT WOULD BE THE FIRST ONE TO GET IN THAT SPECIAL KIND OF TROUBLE ONLY A TEENAGE GIRL CAN GET IN
POD1000000019_S0000238	ONLY TURNS OUT IT'S THE MISS GOODY TWO SHOES OF THE TOWN WHO GETS KNOCKED UP BY THE TOWN DOCTOR'S SON INSTEAD
POD1000000019_S0000240	IT WENT TO NUMBER SIX ON THE COUNTRY CHART AND NUMBER FIFTY FIVE ON THE BILLBOARD HOT ONE HUNDRED I WOULD CALL THAT A HIT SONG
POD1000000019_S0000242	AFTER THAT AUDREY MAYHUE PUT OUT AN ALBUM CONSISTING OF EVERYTHING HE HAD SUNG BY JENNY DURING HER TIME WITH LITTLE DARLIN
POD1000000019_S0000244	THE ALBUM IS CALLED SOCK SOUL I'M GUESSING IN REFERENCE TO THE LINE IN HARPER VALLEY PTA ABOUT HOW MRS JOHNSON SOCKED IT TO HIM
POD1000000019_S0000245	BUT THIS STUFF WAS ALL RECORDED BEFORE ANYONE THOUGHT OF JEANEY RILEY AS THE LOUDEST VOICE CALLING BS ON AMERICAN SOCIETY SO NONE OF THE SONGS FIT THAT ALBUM TITLE OR HER IMAGE
POD1000000019_S0000246	THE MATERIAL IS GOOD IT'S JUST IN THE SAME VEIN BEING MINED BY EVERY OTHER FEMALE VOICE IN COUNTRY MUSIC
POD1000000019_S0000248	THE PRICE I PAID TO STAY BARELY CRACKED THE COUNTRY TOP FORTY FROM THERE HER SINGLES WERE HIT OR MISS IF YOU JUDGE THEM BY COMMERCIAL RESULTS
POD1000000019_S0000249	BUT EVEN WHEN SHE RELEASED A LEGITIMATE HIT NOBODY SAW IT THAT WAY BECAUSE IT WASN'T ANOTHER HARPER VALLEY PTA
POD1000000019_S0000251	HER FIRST PROPER SINGLE RELEASED AFTER THAT LITTLE DARLIN COMPILATION OF BASICALLY DEMO RECORDINGS WAS THERE NEVER WAS A TIME
POD1000000019_S0000252	HERE'S HER DOING IT ON THE JOHNNY CASH SHOW
POD1000000019_S0000254	THAT SONG WAS A TOP FIVE COUNTRY HIT THAT ALSO CRACKED THE POP HOT ONE HUNDRED NOW LISTEN TO HOW GREAT THIS OTHER SINGLE IS FROM THE SAME ALBUM AS THAT SONG THE BACKSIDE OF DALLAS WASN'T A HIT BUT IT'S A DAMN GOOD SONG
POD1000000019_S0000256	UP UNTIL THE MID SEVENTY S THE QUALITY OF HER MUSIC REMAINED PRETTY CONSISTENT HERE'S HER NEXT TOP TEN COUNTRY GIRL
POD1000000019_S0000258	SHE WAS STARTING TO BRANCH AWAY FROM THE HARPER VALLEY PTA PROTOTYPE OF GETTING ON A MICROPHONE AND POINTING FINGERS
POD1000000019_S0000259	SOCIETY ALSO LETTING JENNY MULTITRACK HER OWN HARMONY VOCALS WAS A GREAT WAY TO SHUT UP THE CRITICS WHO LIKED TO SAY SHE HAD NO RANGE AS A SINGER
POD1000000019_S0000260	AND OF COURSE MOST OF THESE CRITICS WERE POP WRITERS WHO WERE ONLY AWARE OF GENE CRILLY BECAUSE OF THE POP SUCCESS OF HARBOR VALLEY PTA AND WHOSE ONLY OTHER FRAME OF REFERENCE FOR COUNTRY MUSIC IN THE SIXTY S AND SEVENTY S WAS PROBABLY JOHNNY CASH
POD1000000019_S0000261	LIKE THE LA TIMES POP CRITIC ROBERT HILBURN WHO REVIEWED A GNC RILEY CONCERT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE UNDER THE HEADLINE LITTLE TALENT
POD1000000019_S0000262	JANE C REILLY HAS ALL THE CONFIDENCE IN THE WORLD BUT UNFORTUNATELY VERY LITTLE OF THE TALENT
POD1000000019_S0000263	FIRST OF ALL HER VOICE ISN'T ANY GOOD SECOND NEITHER IS HER MATERIAL THAT'S TWO STRIKES AGAINST HER AND AS SOON AS THE PUBLIC FORGETS HARPER VALLEY PTA THAT'S THREE STRIKES AND SHE'S OUT
POD1000000019_S0000264	NOW MAYBE THAT GUY WAS HAVING A BAD DAY OR SOMETHING BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL HE'S TALKING ABOUT HE'S WRONG ON EVERY SINGLE POINT FROM EVERYTHING I'VE SEEN JENNY RILEY WAS EVEN BETTER LIVE THAN ON RECORDING
POD1000000019_S0000266	CHECK OUT THIS PERFORMANCE OF A SONG YOU HEARD JUST A LITTLE BIT AGO BACKSIDE OF DALLAS
POD1000000019_S0000268	SHE ALWAYS HAD A CRACK BAND BEHIND HER THE HARPER VALLEY EXPRESS THEY USUALLY MADE THE TEMPO OF EVERYTHING FASTER TO REALLY PUT SOME GAS IN THE TANK AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO DENY JENNY'S CHARISMA AS A PERFORMER
POD1000000019_S0000270	THE SONG SHE'S SINGING IS ABOUT A WOMAN BECOMING A PROSTITUTE AND HER EXPRESSIONS ALTERNATE BETWEEN SASSY AND SERIOUS IN A WAY THAT KEEPS SHIFTING THE MEANING OF THE LYRICS
POD1000000019_S0000272	THOSE CHARM SCHOOL CLASSES PAID OFF SHE KNEW HOW TO WORK A CROWD STRIKING POSES AND FLASHING TWENTY DIFFERENT KINDS OF SMILE IN ALL THE RIGHT PLACES
POD1000000019_S0000273	BUT THAT LA TIMES REVIEW OF HER CONCERT IS THE SORT OF DISMISSIVE ATTITUDE THE POP INTELLIGENTSIA HAD TOWARDS SOUTHERN CULTURE
POD1000000019_S0000274	NOT ONLY WAS JEANEY NOT A ONE HIT WONDER SHE MADE GOOD ALBUMS WITH VERY LITTLE FILLER CHECK OUT THIS ALBUM TRACK FROM NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO NEVER EVEN RELEASED AS A SINGLE CALLED WITHOUT YOU
POD1000000019_S0000276	HER VOICE IS ON THE MELODY IS THERE WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT FROM A COUNTRY LOVE SONG THIS IS THE KIND OF TRACK YOU HOPE IS WAITING TO SURPRISE YOU WHEN YOU BUY SOMEONE'S ALBUM BASED ON ONE OR TWO OF THE SINGLES
POD1000000019_S0000277	WITHOUT YOU IS FROM JANE'S SECOND ALBUM ON MGM AFTER LEAVING PLANTATION RECORDS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO IN WHAT SHELBY SINGLETON CALLED A BREACH OF CONTRACT
POD1000000019_S0000278	JANE'S LUCK IN THE COURTROOM HELD WINNING THIS CASE AS WELL THOUGH SHE MAINTAINED FOR THE REST OF HER CAREER THAT SHE WAS NEVER PAID WHAT SHE BELIEVED SHE WAS OWED FOR HARPER VALLEY PTAS EARNINGS
POD1000000019_S0000280	HER FULL COMMITMENT TO CHRISTIANITY SEEMS TO HAVE TAKEN PLACE SOMETIME IN THE SEVENTY S
POD1000000019_S0000281	AND SEEMS TO HAVE CAUSED AT LEAST SOME REGRET FOR HER PREVIOUS PERSONA AS COUNTRY MUSIC'S MOST BLATANT SEX SYMBOL TO DATE THE CLOTHING CHANGED THE MUSIC TOOK A TURN TO GOSPEL AND
POD1000000019_S0000282	THIS IS PURELY SPECULATION ON MY PART BUT IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE MONEY COULD HAVE REALLY BECOME A PROBLEM FOR HER IN THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY S
POD1000000019_S0000283	THAT AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF HERS WAS PUBLISHED IN THE YEAR NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE SHORTLY BEFORE THE RELEASE OF A GOSPEL ALBUM WITH THE SAME TITLE AS THE BOOK
POD1000000019_S0000284	GENERALLY SPEAKING WHEN A MUSICAL ARTIST QUOTE UNQUOTE PAST THEIR PRIME PUTS OUT AN ALBUM RIGHT AFTER THEY PUT OUT A BOOK
POD1000000019_S0000285	IT'S SAFE TO ASSUME THAT BOOK IS MEANT TO GENERATE NEW INTEREST IN THAT ARTIST MUSIC IN ADVANCE OF THE NEW ALBUM
POD1000000019_S0000287	IN OTHER WORDS IT'S OFTEN A PROMOTIONAL STRATEGY IF THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED HERE THEN THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THIS BOOK WAS PRINTED BY A SMALL PUBLISHER OF CHRISTIAN BOOKS
POD1000000019_S0000289	IT MAY NOT BE SAFE TO ASSUME THAT NO MAJOR PUBLISHERS WERE INTERESTED AND THAT'S WHY JENNY WENT WITH THE SMALL CHRISTIAN PUBLISHER
POD1000000019_S0000290	HOWEVER IT DOES SEEM VERY SAFE TO ASSUME THAT THIS SMALL CHRISTIAN PUBLISHING HOUSE WOULD MOSTLY IF NOT EXCLUSIVELY HAVE A PROMOTIONAL NETWORK MEANT TO GET THEIR PRODUCT IN FRONT OF CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIANS
POD1000000019_S0000291	AKA THE EXACT OPPOSITE AUDIENCE OF THE ONLY REASON ANYONE KNOWS JENNY RILEY'S NAME HARPER VALLEY PTA A SONG HIGHLY CRITICAL OF HYPOCRISY IN SOCIAL GROUPS WITH HARDCORE CONSERVATIVE VALUES
POD1000000019_S0000293	EVEN THE MUSIC FANS WHO DID FIND THE BOOK WOULDN'T BE LIKELY TO RECOMMEND IT TO A FRIEND BECAUSE OF HOW POORLY IT IS WRITTEN AND HOW MOST OF IT IS IRRELEVANT TO HER CAREER IN MUSIC
POD1000000019_S0000295	PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT THE BOOK BECAUSE THEY HAPPENED TO SEE IT ON ONE OF THEIR REGULAR TRIPS TO THE CHRISTIAN BOOKSTORE WOULD NO DOUBT BE SCANDALIZED BY JENNY'S RAMPANT INFIDELITY AND THE POT SMOKING
POD1000000019_S0000297	THE USED COPY THAT I HAVE ONCE BELONGED TO A LIBRARY IN NEW MEXICO IT STILL HAS THE STAMP CARD IN THE BACK I CAN SEE HERE THAT ONLY FOUR PEOPLE CHECKED IT OUT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE
POD1000000019_S0000298	THE YEAR IT WAS PUBLISHED ONE PERSON IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO NOBODY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE AND ONE OR TWO READERS A YEAR AT BEST FROM THERE IT WAS DISCARDED IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE
POD1000000019_S0000299	HAVING BEEN CHECKED OUT A GRAND TOTAL OF THIRTEEN TIMES NOT GOOD ESPECIALLY IF THAT WAS THE MAIN PLAN TO GET PEOPLE HYPED FOR THAT NEW GOSPEL ALBUM
POD1000000019_S0000300	WHICH ENTIRELY FAILED TO CHART IF SHE HAD HOPES OF GETTING OFF THE ROAD WHERE SHE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN MAKING MOST OF HER INCOME FROM HARPER VALLEY TO THE MOUNTAINTOP AS A BOOK ALBUM COMBO DID NOT DELIVER
POD1000000019_S0000301	NEXT MOVE ASK TOM HALL TO WRITE ANOTHER HARPER VALLEY PTA A THING HE'D BEEN VERY VOCAL ABOUT HIS RELUCTANCE TO DO BUT ALSO HE'S A BIG SOFT
POD1000000019_S0000302	IT'S EASY TO IMAGINE HIM HAVING A HARD TIME SAYING NO WHEN JENNY CAME TO HIM ABOUT IT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR TOM WROTE RETURN TO HARPER VALLEY FOR HER HE EVEN MADE ALL THE LYRICS FIT JANE'S NEW CHRISTIAN LIFESTYLE
POD1000000019_S0000304	WE'RE BACK AT HARPER VALLEY HIGH BECAUSE OUR NARRATOR'S GRANDCHILDREN GO TO THE SCHOOL NOW AND SHE'S BOUGHT A TICKET TO THE RAFFLE AT A SCHOOL DANCE SHE'S WEARING A DRESS THAT'S WELL BELOW HER KNEES
POD1000000019_S0000305	BECAUSE JUST ABOUT EVERY CHARACTER FROM THE ORIGINAL SONG IS NOW ON THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW
POD1000000019_S0000307	WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT SHE SPOTS A MAN GIVING A CIGARETTE TO A SCHOOL KID AND IT TURNS OUT HE'S SELLING DRUGS IN THE PARKING LOT THERE'S THE DRUMMER OF THE BAND DOING COCAINE AND THESE KIDS ARE ALL GETTING DRUNK AND TAKING PILLS AND TAKING OFF THEIR CLOTHES
POD1000000019_S0000308	SHE THINKS ABOUT GOING HOME FOR HER GUN BUT INSTEAD DECIDES TO GO HOME PRAY WITH HER BIBLE AND YOU GUESSED IT BRING ALL THIS UP AT THE NEXT MEETING OF THE HARPER VALLEY PTA
POD1000000019_S0000309	IN SHORT THE SONG IS TERRIBLE NOBODY CARED AT ALL
POD1000000019_S0000310	EVEN WITH TOM JOINING JENNY FOR PROMO APPEARANCES ON ALL THE USUAL TV SHOWS LIKE NASHVILLE NOW TOM
POD1000000019_S0000313	AS YOU HEARD THERE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A SENSE OF URGENCY IN THE WRITING RECORDING AND RELEASE OF THIS SONG WHATEVER THE REASON FOR THE RUSH AND EVEN IF FANS OF THE ORIGINAL SONG HAD GROWN TO DEVELOP MORE CONSERVATIVE VALUES
POD1000000019_S0000314	THERE SIMPLY WASN'T ENOUGH INTEREST IN THIS RETURN TO GENERATE AIRPLAY OR SALES FIGURES
POD1000000019_S0000316	SEVEN YEARS LATER IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE JENNY PUT OUT WHAT LOOKS LIKE WILL BE HER FINAL FORMALLY RELEASED SINGLE HERE'S TO THE COWBOYS
POD1000000019_S0000318	THE ENTIRE REVIEW IN BILLBOARD IS ONE SENTENCE RILEY GIVES A POIGNANT READING OF THIS TRIBUTE TO COWBOYS WHO ARE COMMITTED ENOUGH TO BE DOMESTICATED
POD1000000019_S0000320	AS SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE SEEN ON FOX NEWS IN TWO THOUSAND TWO SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE SHE APPARENTLY FORGOT THAT SHE WORKED WITH THE GUY WHO WAS PROBABLY RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING THE ELVIS IS STILL ALIVE RUMORS

POD1000000019_S0000338	YEAH ENJOY
POD1000000019_S0000339	ALRIGHT HERE ARE THE LINER NOTES FOR ANY RILEY
POD1000000019_S0000340	I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS IN FOR WHEN I BEGAN THIS EPISODE AND I'LL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THAT I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE TRUTH IS HERE
POD1000000019_S0000341	JUST WOW
POD1000000019_S0000342	I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I'M REALLY ALLOWED TO SAY RIGHT NOW BUT I GUESS IF I'M GONNA GET IN TROUBLE FOR THIS THAN I PROBABLY ALREADY CROSSED THAT LINE SO
POD1000000019_S0000343	I KNOW THERE ARE LIES IN THIS EPISODE BECAUSE I TOLD YOU WHICH ONES I FOUND OUT ABOUT BUT I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT ELSE IS OR ISN'T A LIE
POD1000000019_S0000344	ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT I DID NOT KNOWINGLY PERPETUATE A LIE WHEN I'M READING A BOOK I PRETTY MUCH ALWAYS SAVE THE PREFACE AND FORWARD STUFF UNTIL AFTER I'VE READ THE BOOK
POD1000000019_S0000345	BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW TIMES READING SOME CLASSIC NOVEL OR SOMETHING WHERE THE PERSON WRITING THE FORWARD SOME SCHOLAR OR SOMEONE ASSUMES EVERYONE MUST HAVE ALREADY READ THIS BOOK BEFORE
POD1000000019_S0000346	AND THEY DROP MAJOR SPOILERS RIGHT THERE BEFORE YOU'VE EVEN READ THE FIRST PAGE SO OUT OF HABIT I JUST NEVER READ THAT STUFF IN THE BEGINNING OF A BOOK IF THE BOOK'S GOOD I'LL USUALLY GO BACK AND READ IT OR IF I'M JUST LIKE WHAT THE HELL DID I JUST READ THEN I'LL GO BACK AND READ IT
POD1000000019_S0000347	AND THAT THAT SECOND SCENARIO WAS VERY MUCH THE CASE WITH JEANES RILEY'S BOOK BY THE SECOND PAGE OF THE BOOK WHEN SHE WAS PUTTING THOSE WORDS IN SHELBY SINGLETON'S MOUTH AND IT JUST DIDN'T SEEM LIKE THE WAY HE TALKED TO ME
POD1000000019_S0000348	IT DIDN'T MAKE SENSE THE WAY THAT SHE WAS HAVING HIM ACT BASED ON OTHER INFORMATION SHE WAS GIVING YOU AT THE SAME TIME I HAD A FEELING SOMETHING WAS UP
POD1000000019_S0000349	THEN A LITTLE BIT LATER SHE'S WRITING ABOUT HAVING JUST MARRIED MICKE WHILE SHE'S STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL I'LL JUST READ IT TO YOU OUT OF THE BOOK THIS IS A QUOTE
POD1000000019_S0000350	MICKEY AND I MOVED INTO A SMALL APARTMENT AND STRUGGLED EACH MONTH TO MAKE IT ON HIS SALARY WE POSTPONED GOING TO NASHVILLE UNTIL I GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL AND WE COULD SAVE SOME MONEY
POD1000000019_S0000351	I WAS AT THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE FOR A CHECKUP WHEN HE TOLD ME HE THOUGHT I WAS PREGNANT IN ANOTHER MONTH WE'LL KNOW FOR SURE HE SAID OKAY AND THE QUOTE
POD1000000019_S0000352	I DIDN'T SKIP OVER ANYTHING THERE AT ALL SHE WRITES A SENTENCE ABOUT WAITING TO MOVE TO NASHVILLE UNTIL SHE GRADUATES HIGH SCHOOL THEN THE VERY NEXT SENTENCE IS ABOUT HER FINDING OUT SHE'S PREGNANT
POD1000000019_S0000353	THERE'S A FOUR YEAR GAP BETWEEN THOSE TWO SENTENCES I STILL HAVE NO IDEA WHY THAT GAP IS THERE BUT THAT'S WHEN I KNEW I WAS READING SOME BULLSHIT
POD1000000019_S0000354	SO AFTER FINISHING THE BOOK I WENT BACK TO READ THE STUFF AT THE BEGINNING AND I FOUND THAT DISCLAIMER ABOUT THE FACTS BEING ALTERED
POD1000000019_S0000355	AND THAT DISCLAIMER IS WRITTEN BY JENNY'S CO AUTHOR WHO I ALSO FAILED TO MENTION IS A PREACHER HERE'S WHAT HE WRITES QUOTE TO KEEP FROM HURTING SOME OF THE FOLKS JENNY LOVES WE HAVE CHANGED THE NAMES OF SEVERAL PEOPLE IN THE BOOK
POD1000000019_S0000356	IN ONE INSTANCE WE ALSO CHANGED THE DETAILS SLIGHTLY TO PURPOSEFULLY DISGUISE A SCENE
POD1000000019_S0000357	ONLY THOSE WHO WERE INVOLVED WILL RECOGNIZE WHAT WE HAVE DONE BUT ALL THE REST IS TRUE JUST AS IT HAPPENED WHEN GOD PICKED UP THE HARPER VALLEY GIRL AND SET HER ON A MOUNTAIN TOP
POD1000000019_S0000358	OK EVEN THAT DISCLAIMER IS SO ENTIRELY BIZARRE THE WHOLE THING MAKES ME WONDER IF THIS GUY IS EVEN TALKING ABOUT INVENTING THE CHARACTER OF PHIL BLACKMAN
POD1000000019_S0000359	FIRST OF ALL THEY CHANGED THE NAMES TO PROTECT PEOPLE JENNY LOVES JENNY LOVES THE PERSON WHO BLACKMAILED HER WITH REVENGE PORN OKAY NEXT IN ONE INSTANCE WE HAVE CHANGED THE DETAILS SLIGHTLY TO DISGUISE A SCENE
POD1000000019_S0000360	THAT IS NOT AT ALL AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF PHIL BLACK MAN'S EXISTENCE IN THIS BOOK THERE ARE MANY SCENES THAT HAD A LOT MORE THAN SLIGHT DETAILS CHANGED
POD1000000019_S0000361	SEVERAL THAT HAD TO HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY FABRICATED ANYWHERE IN THE BOOK SHE TALKS ABOUT THE FIRST BLACK ROSE SINGLE IS A LIE TALKING ABOUT MEETING AUDREY MAYHUE IN LAS VEGAS
POD1000000019_S0000362	IS A LIE TALKING ABOUT GETTING OUT OF A CONTRACT WITH PHIL BLACKMAN TO RECORD WITH AUBREY MAYHUE
POD1000000019_S0000363	IS A LIE IT WOULD TAKE ME TEN MINUTES TO LIST EVERYTHING THAT IS FOR SURE A LIE AND IT WOULD PROBABLY TAKE ME HALF AN HOUR TO LIST EVERYTHING I SUSPECT IS A LIE IN THIS BOOK
POD1000000019_S0000364	THEN STILL WITH THIS DISCLAIMER THE PART AT THE END WHERE HE WRITES QUOTE BUT ALL THE REST IS TRUE END QUOTE HE WASN'T THERE WHEN ALL OF THIS STUFF HAPPENED SO ALL THAT MEANS IS THIS IS WHAT SHE TOLD ME HAPPENED
POD1000000019_S0000365	AND THAT REALLY MAKES ME WONDER IF JEAN CAME UP WITH THIS WHOLE PHIL BLACKMAN STORYLINE ON HER OWN AND TRIED TO SELL IT TO THIS GUY AS FACT
POD1000000019_S0000366	MAYBE HE FIGURED OUT SHE WAS LYING SO THIS DISCLAIMER IS HIS WAY OF COVERING HIS OWN ASS IN CASE I DON'T KNOW AUDREY MAYHUE DECIDED TO SUE THE SHIT OUT OF HIM
POD1000000019_S0000367	THIS IS ALL OBVIOUSLY WILD SPECULATION ON MY PART BUT AT THIS POINT I'M NOT SURE WHAT OTHER RESPONSE I COULD POSSIBLY HAVE TO THIS PILE OF NONSENSE THE ATTEMPT AT DISGUISING THE TRUTH IS SO CLUMSY THAT IT EVEN PRESENTS ANOTHER POSSIBILITY
POD1000000019_S0000368	WHICH IS THAT THEY WANTED PEOPLE TO FIGURE OUT THE TRUTH AND HAVE IT BLOW UP INTO THIS BIG CONTROVERSY TO SELL THE BOOK THAT CERTAINLY SOUNDS LIKE A BUSINESS STRATEGY SOMEONE MIGHT PICK UP FROM SAY WORKING WITH SHELBY SINGLETON
POD1000000019_S0000369	THE ONLY PROBLEM BEING THAT HARDLY ANYONE READ THIS STUPID BOOK IN THE FIRST PLACE SO THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN THERE'S SO MUCH OTHER STUFF IN THAT AUTOBIOGRAPHY THAT I DIDN'T EVEN GET INTO
POD1000000019_S0000370	DEFINITELY DO BUY THIS BOOK IF YOU WANT TO SEE A WORST CASE EXAMPLE OF A COUNTRY SINGER AUTOBIOGRAPHY
POD1000000019_S0000371	I HADN'T YET BEEN BROKEN DOWN ENOUGH BY MAKING THIS PODCAST TO JUST START WRITING IN THE BOOKS I READ OR ELSE WHOEVER ENDS UP WITH MY COPY OF THIS ONE COULD HAVE LOOKED FORWARD TO SOME PRETTY INTENSE SCRIBBLES ALL OVER IT I'M SURE
POD1000000019_S0000372	OH YEAH BY THE WAY I AM GIVING AWAY THE BOOKS THAT I READ TO MAKE SEASON ONE OF THIS PODCAST COCAINE AND RHINESTONES DOT COM SLASH GIVEAWAY FOR DETAILS ON THAT YOU COULD END UP WITH MY COPY OF THIS BOOK WITH A LIBRARY CARD IN THE BACK AND EVERYTHING
POD1000000019_S0000373	A REAL PIECE OF PODCAST HISTORY OKAY ALL OF THIS DECEPTION ASIDE I THINK WE'RE STARTING TO GET AN IDEA OF HOW DIFFERENTLY ALL THE PEOPLE INVOLVED CAN COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE OF A HIT SONG
POD1000000019_S0000374	ONE THING THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING THAT WE HEARD TODAY IS UNLIKE AS YOU HEARD IN THE SECOND EPISODE OF THE PODCAST LORETTA LYNN'S RECORDING OF THE PILL
POD1000000019_S0000375	THE MUSIC ESTABLISHMENT IN NASHVILLE AND EVERYWHERE ELSE MOSTLY JUST GOT ON BOARD WITH THIS SONG RIGHT AWAY TEXT WRITER DID SAY THAT THE SONG SOUNDED DIRTY AND SUGGESTIVE AND SOME RADIO STATIONS DID BAN IT BUT WHO CARES
POD1000000019_S0000376	I LET YOU HEAR IT FROM INDUSTRY GIANTS YOU HEARD JOHNNY CASH SAY IT WON A GRAMMY AWARD YOU HEARD ROGER MILLER ANNOUNCE IT AS THE SINGLE OF THE YEAR
POD1000000019_S0000377	SURE THE LYRICS AREN'T SCANDALOUS AT ALL COMPARED TO THE PILL BUT WHY DO YOU THINK THESE TWO SONGS WERE RECEIVED SO DIFFERENTLY BY THE OLD GUARD I KNOW WHAT I THINK
POD1000000019_S0000378	I THINK MONEY TALKS I THINK THAT BY THE TIME ANY OF THOSE WOULD BE BUZZKILL STARTED PAYING ATTENTION THIS SONG WAS ALREADY THE NUMBER ONE POP SONG IN AMERICA AND IT WENT NUMBER ONE POP BEFORE IT WENT NUMBER ONE COUNTRY
POD1000000019_S0000379	EVERY MAJOR RECORD LABEL IN NASHVILLE HAD BEEN FALLING ALL OVER ITSELF FOR FIFTEEN YEARS TRYING TO DO THAT THEY'D HAVE MADE JEAN CRILLY THE MAYOR OF NASHVILLE IF SHE DID IT A SECOND TIME
POD1000000019_S0000380	HER SECOND SINGLE DIDN'T GET THERE BUT THEY LET HER HANG AROUND A WHILE TO SEE IF IT HAPPENED AGAIN IT DIDN'T AND THIS IS THE STORY WE END UP WITH

POD1000000021_S0000032	THAT'S MARC MORIAL HE WORKED WITH EDWARDS AS A STATE LEGISLATOR AND AS THE MAYOR OF NEW ORLEANS
POD1000000021_S0000033	IN LOUISIANA IF YOU CAN PUT THOSE TWO VOTING BASES TOGETHER IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS AN UNBEATABLE COALITION
POD1000000021_S0000034	UNLIKE MOST OF HIS WHITE DEMOCRATIC PEERS EDWARDS WAS AN UNABASHED CIVIL RIGHTS CHAMPION
POD1000000021_S0000035	HE INVITED BLACK LOUISIANANS TO WORK IN GOVERNMENT POSITIONS AND HELPED CRAFT A STATE CONSTITUTION THAT OUTLAWED DISCRIMINATION

POD1000000021_S0000046	EDWARDS LED LOUISIANA FOR EIGHT YEARS LEAVING OFFICE IN MARCH NINETEEN EIGHTY
POD1000000021_S0000047	THE ONLY THING STOPPING HIM FROM BEING GOVERNOR FOR LIFE WERE TERM LIMITS THAT EDWARDS HIMSELF HAD PUSHED FOR
POD1000000021_S0000048	SO HE WENT ON A BRIEF HIATUS SETTING OUT THE NEXT ELECTION CYCLE THEN RETURNING IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE TO RECLAIM HIS THRONE
POD1000000021_S0000049	IN THE LAST DAYS OF THAT CAMPAIGN EDWARDS FIRED OFF HIS MOST FAMOUS ONE LINER

POD1000000021_S0000059	TO CELEBRATE HIS VICTORY HE DID SOMETHING AUDACIOUS EVEN BY EDWIN EDWARDS STANDARDS

POD1000000021_S0000068	THE GOVERNOR ALSO RECEIVED A WARM GREETING FROM A NUN OUTSIDE NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL
POD1000000021_S0000069	AND SHE GAVE HIM WHAT SHE DESCRIBED AS A FRENCH KISS WHICH WAS ACTUALLY COURSE MORE LIKE A NUN'S KISS
POD1000000021_S0000070	BUT SHE COULD TAKE A JOKE AND SO HE SAID OKAY SISTER BUT JUST DON'T LET ME GET INTO THE HABIT
POD1000000021_S0000071	AND ALL OF HIS SUPPORTERS GATHERED AROUND CHEERED AND BEAMED
POD1000000021_S0000072	THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THEY HAD COME TO PARIS FOR
POD1000000021_S0000073	THE PARTY ENDED FOR EDWIN EDWARDS AS SOON AS THOSE JUMBO JETS LANDED BACK IN LOUISIANA

POD1000000021_S0000080	HIS CONSTITUENTS DIDN'T FIND THAT RAKISH OR CHARMING
POD1000000021_S0000081	YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO RAISE TAXES ON PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY STRUGGLING ALREADY IT'S A VERY PRECARIOUS POLITICAL SITUATION TO BE IN
POD1000000021_S0000082	SO THIS TAX PACKAGE WAS PROBABLY THE BEGINNING OF HIS UNPOPULARITY
POD1000000021_S0000083	IN FEBRUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE EDWIN EDWARDS'S RUN OF BAD LUCK
POD1000000021_S0000084	GOT A WHOLE LOT WORSE

POD1000000021_S0000092	AND WE TRIED TO BE AS DIPLOMATIC ABOUT IT AS WE COULD
POD1000000021_S0000093	AND OF COURSE MOST PEOPLE KNEW WHERE HE WAS AND WHAT HE WAS GOING THROUGH BUT THEY CALL ANYWAY
POD1000000021_S0000094	THE CASE ENDED IN A MISTRIAL EDWARDS WAS LATER RETRIED AND FOUND NOT GUILTY
POD1000000021_S0000095	WHEN THAT VERDICT CAME IN THE PROSECUTOR SAID IF WE DIDN'T MAKE HIM HONEST I HOPE WE MADE HIM SORRY
POD1000000021_S0000096	WHEN I ASKED EDWARDS ABOUT THE CASE HE DIDN'T SOUND ALL THAT SORRY
POD1000000021_S0000097	THAT WAS AN EXAMPLE OF OF A STUPID PROSECUTOR WHO DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING
POD1000000021_S0000098	DID IT BOTHER HIM WHEN PEOPLE SAID HE WAS PROFITING FROM HIS ROLE AS THE GOVERNOR

POD1000000021_S0000104	IN GOOD TIMES MOST PEOPLE IN LOUISIANA LOVED HIS MISADVENTURES
POD1000000021_S0000105	BUT THESE WEREN'T GOOD TIMES THE BOOM YEARS OF THE NINETEEN SEVENTY S WERE LONG GONE

POD1000000021_S0000287	A CLOSED DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY DEMOCRATIC RUNOFF AND THEN THE GENERAL ELECTION
POD1000000021_S0000288	IN THE DAYS WHEN DEMOCRATS DOMINATED LOUISIANA THAT LAST RACE AGAINST A REPUBLICAN ALSO RAN WAS A POINTLESS NUISANCE
POD1000000021_S0000289	IT WAS LIKE WINNING THE HUNDRED METER DASH AT THE OLYMPICS THEN HAVING TO OUTSPRINT A KID PULLED FROM THE STANDS TO GET YOUR GOLD MEDAL

POD1000000021_S0000295	BUT IN THE REAGAN YEARS THE GOP SURGED THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH
POD1000000021_S0000296	BY NINETEEN NINETY ONE THE OPEN PRIMARY WAS OPEN IN A WAY EDWARDS MAYBE HADN'T ANTICIPATED
POD1000000021_S0000297	IT WAS A TRUE TWO PARTY FREE FOR ALL
POD1000000021_S0000298	POLITICAL WRITER JOHN MCGINNESS HAD A NAME FOR THE SHOWDOWN BETWEEN DAVID DUKE EDWIN EDWARDS AND BUDDY ROMER

POD1000000021_S0000301	IN THE BEGINNING THE RACE FROM HELL WASN'T EXACTLY ROLLICKING
POD1000000021_S0000302	ONE REASON FOR THAT WAS A PACKAGE OF CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORMS PART OF BUDDY ROMER'S GOOD GOVERNMENT AGENDA
POD1000000021_S0000303	THE NEW LAW LIMITED INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN MAJOR STATEWIDE RACES
POD1000000021_S0000304	BANNED CASH CONTRIBUTIONS OF MORE THAN A HUNDRED DOLLARS AND REQUIRED THAT SMALL CASH DONATIONS BE REPORTED
POD1000000021_S0000305	DUKE COULD PASS THE BUCKET WITH IMPUNITY DURING HIS NINETEEN NINETY SENATE CAMPAIGN BECAUSE THAT WAS A FEDERAL RACE
POD1000000021_S0000306	BUT THANKS TO ROME THE REVOLUTIONARY LOUISIANA'S GUIDELINES ON CASH GIVING WERE NOW STRICTER THAN THE NATIONS
POD1000000021_S0000307	HAMSTRUNG BY THESE NEW RULES DUKE HELD FEWER RALLIES AS A CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR THAN WHEN HE RAN FOR THE SENATE AND EDWARDS'S FUNDRAISING SLOWED TO A TRICKLE
POD1000000021_S0000308	HE'D RAISE SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS DURING THE NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE GOVERNOR'S RACE
POD1000000021_S0000309	IN THE NINETEEN NINETY ONE PRIMARY HE BROUGHT IN A LITTLE MORE THAN ONE MILLION DOLLARS
POD1000000021_S0000310	AND BUDDY ROMER HE PREFERRED STAYING IN TO GOING OUT TO MEET HIS PUBLIC
POD1000000021_S0000311	ROME HAD ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THIS
POD1000000021_S0000312	RAYMOND STRETHER SAW IT UP CLOSE DURING THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN RACE
POD1000000021_S0000313	HE WOULD SIT IN THE BACK CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS AND READ NOVELS USUALLY MYSTERY NOVELS AND HE WOULDN'T GO OUT AND CAMPAIGN
POD1000000021_S0000314	WE'D GO TO A RESTAURANT TO EAT LUNCH AND HE WOULD SIT IN THE BACK OF THE RESTAURANT IN A CORNER WITH HIS BACK TO THE ROOM
POD1000000021_S0000315	SO NOBODY WOULD SEE HIM AND RECOGNIZED HIM AND COME OVER AND START TALKING
POD1000000021_S0000316	ROME'S CHARISMATIC MISANTHROPE ROUTINE HAD WORKED OUT FINE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
POD1000000021_S0000317	AND IT SEEMED POSSIBLE HE COULD PULL OFF THE SAME TRICK IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE
POD1000000021_S0000318	MICHELLE SHOWER STARTED VOLUNTEERING FOR THE ROMER CAMPAIGN WHEN SHE WAS STILL IN COLLEGE AT LOUISIANA TECH THEN GOT A JOB ON STAFF RIGHT AFTER GRADUATION

POD1000000021_S0000320	AND HE LITERALLY WALKED INTO THE ROOM YOU KNOW PUSHING BOTH DOORS OPEN
POD1000000021_S0000321	GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYBODY GREAT TO SEE YOU
POD1000000021_S0000322	NOW HE WAS CLAPPING AND SMILING AND REALLY EXUBERANT
POD1000000021_S0000323	AND IT WAS REALLY VERY EXCITING TO BE IN A ROOM WITH
POD1000000021_S0000324	WAS JUST REALLY ENGAGING THE CROWD
POD1000000021_S0000325	AND I WOULD SAY FOR THE FIRST PART OF THE CAMPAIGN THAT'S THE WAY HE WAS HE REALLY CAME INTO A ROOM AND MADE IT ALIVE
POD1000000021_S0000326	THE PROBLEM FOR ROMER WAS THAT A LOT OF SWING VOTERS FELT DRAWN TO ANOTHER CANDIDATE
POD1000000021_S0000327	AT FIRST STRATER LIKED THE FOCUS GROUP RESULTS HE WAS HEARING
POD1000000021_S0000328	BLUECOLLAR DEMOCRATS SAID THEY COULDN'T STAND A HYPOTHETICAL CANDIDATE WITH ALL OF DAVID DUKE'S CHARACTERISTICS
POD1000000021_S0000329	BUT THEN AS SOON AS THEY LEARNED IT WAS DAVID DUKE THEY'D SAY WOW THAT'S WHAT POLITICIANS DO OR
POD1000000021_S0000330	WELL YOU KNOW KKK
POD1000000021_S0000331	WELL HE WAS A YOUNG MAN NAZI WELL HE WAS A YOUNG GUY
POD1000000021_S0000332	COLLEGE KIDS DO STUPID STUFF YOU KNOW WHATEVER IT WAS THEY MAKE AN EXCUSE FOR HIM
POD1000000021_S0000333	WHILE ROMER STRUGGLED TO HOLD HIS COALITION TOGETHER DUKE WAS FINDING A NEW WAY TO EXPAND HIS APPEAL
POD1000000021_S0000334	IT'S BEEN TOUGH FOR ME SOMETIMES OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS A LOT OF MEDIA ATTACKS BUT WHAT MADE MADE IT BETTER FOR ME IS THAT I'M A CHRISTIAN
POD1000000021_S0000335	I WORK HARD I BELIEVE IN CHRIST AND I'M GOING TO KEEP ON FIGHTING FOR YOU AND FOR THE FUTURE OF LOUISIANA
POD1000000021_S0000336	THANK YOU VERY MUCH
POD1000000021_S0000338	DUKE INVOKED HIS CHRISTIANITY FAR MORE IN THE GOVERNOR'S RACE THAN IN ANY OF HIS PREVIOUS CAMPAIGNS
POD1000000021_S0000339	HE USED RELIGION AS BOTH A SHIELD AND SWORD
POD1000000021_S0000340	AT A DEBATE IN SEPTEMBER DUKE SAID THAT HE'D REPENTED FOR HIS PAST SINS AND THAT THOSE WHO TRIED TO DISCREDIT HIM WERE BEING UNCHRISTIAN
POD1000000021_S0000341	I'VE CERTAINLY BEEN INTOLERANT BEFORE IN MY LIFE
POD1000000021_S0000342	BUT THOSE WHO WOULD CONDEMN AND POINT THEIR FINGERS AT ME I'D LIKE THEM TO LOOK IN THEIR OWN LIVES AND ASK IF THEY'VE NEVER HEARD A FRIEND OR CHANGE THEIR OPINIONS
POD1000000021_S0000343	IT WASN'T CLEAR BASED ON POLLING HOW WHITE PEOPLE IN LOUISIANA WERE RESPONDING TO DUKE'S LATEST ATTEMPT AT IMAGE MANAGEMENT
POD1000000021_S0000344	SUSAN HOWELL HAD BEEN STRUGGLING FOR YEARS TO GET A HANDLE ON DUKE'S VOTERS
POD1000000021_S0000345	HE WAS A PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW ORLEANS
POD1000000021_S0000346	SHE'D TAKEN HER FIRST LOOK AT DUKE DURING HIS RUN FOR THE STATE HOUSE WHEN HIS OPPONENT JOHN GREEN HIRED HER TO DO A PHONE SURVEY
POD1000000021_S0000347	HOWELLS POLL IN THE PRIMARY HAD DUKE SEVEN PERCENT SHE WAS OFF BY TWENTY SIX POINTS
POD1000000021_S0000348	AND I WAS STUNNED AND THEN JOHN TREE STOOD UP ON A TABLE AND HE WAS STUNNED TOO AND
POD1000000021_S0000349	I REMEMBER HIM SAYING THE PEOPLE OF MEDAR ARE NOT RACIST
POD1000000021_S0000350	AND I THOUGHT WELL MAYBE WE SHOULD RETHINK THAT
POD1000000021_S0000351	TRIN FIRED AFTER THE PRIMARY SO SHE'D HAVE TO WAIT TO PULL ANOTHER DUKE RACE
POD1000000021_S0000352	BUT SHE HAD A PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH HIS SUPPORTERS
POD1000000021_S0000353	PEOPLE WERE RELUCTANT TO SAY I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR DUKE BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID OF BEING LABELED RACIST EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE TALKING YOU KNOW ON AN ANONYMOUS PHONE CALL TO A POSTER
POD1000000021_S0000354	IT'S LIKE PEOPLE ARE RELUCTANT TO SAY HOW MUCH ALCOHOL THEY DRINK OR WERE THEY EVER ARRESTED
POD1000000021_S0000355	THIS BECAME A RESEARCH CHALLENGE FOR HOWELL AND HER GRADUATE STUDENTS HOW COULD THEY GET DAVID DUKE'S SILENT ARMY TO BREAK ITS SILENCE
POD1000000021_S0000356	WE CAME UP WITH SOME ALTERNATE I WOULD CALL SNEAKER INDIRECT QUESTIONS TO IDENTIFY SOMEONE WHO MIGHT BE SYMPATHETIC TO DUKE
POD1000000021_S0000357	ONE OF THEM WHICH ACTUALLY WORKED PRETTY WELL IN INCREASING THE DUKE SUPPORT IN THE POLL WAS TO ASK PEOPLE IF THEY APPROVE OR DISAPPROVE OF THE MARTIN LUTHER KING HOLIDAY
POD1000000021_S0000358	HOWELL CONDUCTED A SURVEY ONE MONTH BEFORE THE GUBERNATORIAL PRIMARY
POD1000000021_S0000359	RESPONDENTS WERE ASKED WHO THEY WERE VOTING FOR AND ALSO HOW THEY FELT ABOUT STATEMENTS LIKE IF BLACKS WOULD ONLY TRY HARDER THEY COULD BE JUST AS WELL OFF AS WHITES
POD1000000021_S0000360	THE RAW NUMBERS SHOWED THAT THIRTY FIVE PERCENT OF PEOPLE WERE VOTING FOR BUDDY ROMER THIRTY PERCENT FOR EDWIN EDWARDS AND TWELVE PERCENT FOR DAVID DUKE
POD1000000021_S0000361	BUT WHEN HOWELL ACCOUNTED FOR HER SNEAKIER INDIRECT QUESTIONS SUPPORT FOR ROMER AND EDWARDS DIPPED AND DUKE'S SUPPORT DOUBLED
POD1000000021_S0000362	GIVEN THE MARGIN OF ERROR THE ELECTION WAS TOO CLOSE TO CALL
POD1000000021_S0000364	THAT'S HOW THINGS LOOKED FROM THE OUTSIDE ON THE INSIDE THERE WAS GOSSIP ABOUT A POSSIBLE SECRET ALLIANCE AND THE GOVERNOR'S RACE
POD1000000021_S0000365	HOMER'S POLITICAL CONSULTANT RAYMOND STRETHER HEARD THAT SPECULATION
POD1000000021_S0000366	THE RUMOR THAT WE HEARD WAS THAT EDWIN EDWARDS WAS ENCOURAGING AND PERHAPS FUNDING DAVID DUKE
POD1000000021_S0000368	EDWARDS WANTED REVENGE ON BUDDY ROME AFTER LOSING TO HIM IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN BUT EDWARDS ALSO KNEW HOW TO PLAY THE ODDS
POD1000000021_S0000369	HE WAS SMART ENOUGH THE THEORY WENT TO SENSE THAT HE'D HAVE A BETTER SHOT AGAINST AN EX KLANSMEN THAN AGAINST THE INCUMBENT GOVERNOR
POD1000000021_S0000370	NOBODY HAD ANY PROOF WHATSOEVER
POD1000000021_S0000371	BUT SELDOM RAN INTO ANYBODY ON EITHER SIDE WHO DIDN'T THINK THAT EDWARDS WAS PLAYING FUNNY WITH DAVID DUKE
POD1000000021_S0000373	WHEN I GOT EDWARDS ON THE PHONE
POD1000000021_S0000374	I ASKED IF THERE WAS ANY TRUTH TO ALL THAT CHATTER
POD1000000021_S0000376	DID HE OR HIS SUPPORTERS DO ANYTHING TO HELP DUKE MAKE THE RUNOFF
POD1000000021_S0000377	LIKE EITHER GIVING HIM MONEY OR PROPPING HIM UP IN SOME WAY
POD1000000021_S0000378	DID YOU OR YOUR SUPPORTERS DO ANYTHING TO HELP GET INTO THE RUNOFF WITH YOU
POD1000000021_S0000379	NO I DIDN'T I DIDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS NECESSARY AND I WOULD HAVE MAYBE GOT CAUGHT IN SO I DIDN'T DO THAT
POD1000000021_S0000380	JUST LET HIM RUN HIS RACE I RAN MINE ROME RAN HIS
POD1000000021_S0000382	AND THAT'S AS FAR AS I GOT CHASING DOWN THAT RUMOR
POD1000000021_S0000383	BUT I DID LEARN SOMETHING ELSE
POD1000000021_S0000384	THE EDWARDS CAMPAIGN IT TURNS OUT HAD A TOTALLY DIFFERENT SECRET ALLIANCE
POD1000000021_S0000386	CLYDE HOLLOWAY WAS THE PRO LIFE CONGRESSMAN WHO'D GOTTEN THE OFFICIAL ENDORSEMENT OF THE LOUISIANA REPUBLICAN PARTY
POD1000000021_S0000387	INSTEAD OF DUKER ROMER HE WAS WAY BACK IN THE POLLS IN A DISTANT FOURTH AND NEEDED CASH TO AIR COMMERCIALS
POD1000000021_S0000388	ONE OF EDWIN EDWARDS'S CLOSEST FRIENDS
POD1000000021_S0000390	NEW ONE OF HOLLOWAY'S CAMPAIGN ADVISERS
POD1000000021_S0000391	THE COURT SAYS THE TWO OF THEM HATCHED A PLAN
POD1000000021_S0000392	HE WOULD SHOW ME RESULTS OF A TRACKING POLL WHICH OUR PEOPLE CONFIRMED THAT EVERY VOTE
POD1000000021_S0000393	HOLLOWAY WAS RECEIVING GETTING WAS COMING DIRECTLY OFF OF THE SITTING GOVERNOR BUDDY
POD1000000021_S0000394	AND WE WOULD HAVE PEOPLE THAT WERE LOCKED OUT OR HAVE A LOT OF MONEY TO SUPPORT
POD1000000021_S0000395	WHEN ASKED ME WHAT ELSE HE COULD DO SO WE GET THESE COMMERCIALS ON TV AND RADIO
POD1000000021_S0000396	I SAID THAT WOULD HELP US POSSIBLY GETTING IN THE SECOND PRIMARY WITH DAVID RATHER THAN SITTING GOVERNOR
POD1000000021_S0000397	THE ACCORD IS DESCRIBING AN ELECTORAL DOUBLE BANK SHOT
POD1000000021_S0000398	EDWARD SUPPORTERS SEND MONEY TO HOLLOWAY
POD1000000021_S0000399	HOLLOWAY TAKES VOTES FROM ROME
POD1000000021_S0000400	ROMER SLIDES OUT OF THE RUNOFF AND DUKE SLIDES IN
POD1000000021_S0000401	WE FELT THAT WE COULD BE DAVID DUKE SUBSTANTIALLY AND AROMA WOULD HAVE BEEN A DIFFERENT RESULT
POD1000000021_S0000403	PULLING AT THE TIME SAID IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TIGHT
POD1000000021_S0000404	DID GOVERNOR EDWARDS KNOW ABOUT THIS STRATEGY
POD1000000021_S0000405	YES I INFORMED HIM THAT THAT WAS GOING ON HIS ANSWER WAS BE CAREFUL
POD1000000021_S0000407	WHEN I ASKED EDWARDS ABOUT THE ALLIANCE HE TOLD ME HE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT
POD1000000021_S0000408	IN JOHN MCGINNIS'S BOOK ABOUT THE NINETEEN NINETY ONE CAMPAIGN CLYDE HOLLOWAY'S CAMPAIGN ADVISER BRIAN WAGNER ALSO DENIED MAKING ANY SUCH DEAL
POD1000000021_S0000409	WAGNER DIED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN
POD1000000021_S0000410	THAT SAID I BELIEVED HIM ACORD STORY
POD1000000021_S0000411	TO BE CLEAR NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN ILLEGAL ASSUMING THE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS GOT REPORTED
POD1000000021_S0000412	BUT IT WAS KIND OF DEVIOUS A WAY TO HELP DAVID DUKE WITHOUT GIVING HIM DIRECT SUPPORT
POD1000000021_S0000413	I DON'T WANT TO MAKE THIS ALLIANCE SEEM MORE IMPORTANT THAN IT WAS
POD1000000021_S0000414	THOSE HOLLOWAY ADS WERE JUST A SMALL DROP IN AN ENORMOUS BUCKET OF CAMPAIGN SPENDING
POD1000000021_S0000415	IN THE FINAL DAYS OF THE RACE THE OWNER OF A HAZARDOUS WASTE RECYCLING COMPANY SPENT A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF MONEY ON ANTI ROMA COMMERCIALS BECAUSE HE WAS ANGRY ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS
POD1000000021_S0000416	THAT AD BY WAS A HUGE DEAL
POD1000000021_S0000417	THE HOLLOWAY ADS REALLY WEREN'T
POD1000000021_S0000418	BUT IT'S STILL TELLING THAT THE EDWARDS CAMPAIGN WAS WILLING TO TAKE ACTIVE MEASURES TO HELP DUKE GET INTO THE RUNOFF
POD1000000021_S0000419	I THINK IT IS VERY TYPICAL OF EDWIN EDWARDS
POD1000000021_S0000420	THAT'S QUINN HILLIER HE WAS ONE OF LOUISIANA'S MOST PROMINENT ANTI DUKE REPUBLICANS
POD1000000021_S0000421	HE ALSO THINKS EDWARDS IS TOTALLY CORRUPT
POD1000000021_S0000422	HERE'S WHAT HE HAD TO SAY ABOUT THE EDWARDS HOLLOWAY ALLIANCE
POD1000000021_S0000423	I'M NOT SAYING IT'S IMMORAL IT'S JUST AMORAL COMPLETELY WITHOUT REGARD TO THE MORALITY OF TRYING TO HELP DAVID DUKE GET INTO THE RUNOFF AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT WOULD BE GOOD OR BAD FOR THE STATE OF LOUISIANA
POD1000000021_S0000424	IT CERTAINLY WAS PLAYING EVERY POLITICAL ANGLE AND IT WAS EDWIN EDWARDS AND HIS PEOPLE AT THEIR EDWIN EDWARDSES
POD1000000021_S0000426	THIS WAS IN SOME WAYS TYPICAL LOUISIANA CHICANERY
POD1000000021_S0000427	POLITICS IS SPORT WITH A WIN AT ALL COSTS MENTALITY
POD1000000021_S0000428	BUT DUKE WASN'T A TYPICAL CANDIDATE
POD1000000021_S0000429	MAYBE THE EDWARDS CAMP WAS RIGHT THAT THEIR ODDS WERE BETTER AGAINST DUKE THAN ROMER
POD1000000021_S0000430	BUT WHAT IF THEY WERE WRONG WHAT IF DAVID DUKE WON
POD1000000021_S0000432	WE'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE
POD1000000021_S0000434	I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT ANOTHER PODCAST I THINK YOU'LL LOVE DEEP COVER THE DRUG WARS
POD1000000021_S0000435	IS A TRUE STORY THAT BEGINS WITH A DETROIT FBI AGENT GOING UNDERCOVER IN AN OUTLAW MOTORCYCLE GANG
POD1000000021_S0000436	IT ENDS WITH THE US INVASION OF A FOREIGN COUNTRY
POD1000000021_S0000437	PULITZER PRIZE WINNING JOURNALIST JAKE HALPERN GUIDES LISTENERS ON THIS WILD JOURNEY OF MARIJUANA MOTORCYCLES AND MAN
POD1000000021_S0000438	IT'S PERFECT FOR FANS OF NARCOS SONS OF ANARCHY OR ANYTHING BY THE COEN BROTHERS
POD1000000021_S0000439	YOU CAN HEAR IT NOW ON APPLE PODCASTS OR WHEREVER YOU LISTEN BROUGHT TO YOU BY PUSHKIN INDUSTRIES
POD1000000021_S0000441	IN JANUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE DAVID DUKE HAD BEEN A BIT PLAYER A SECOND TIER CANDIDATE IN A SMALL SUBURBAN RACE
POD1000000021_S0000442	NOW ALMOST THREE YEARS LATER HE WAS A STAR AND A CONTENDER
POD1000000021_S0000443	HIS ELECTION NIGHT PARTY WAS A CELEBRATION OF HOW FAR HE'D COME AND HOW CLOSE HE WAS TO WINNING THE STATE'S BIGGEST PRIZE
POD1000000021_S0000444	YOU WANT TO LOOK I GOT TAKES OVER MY SHIRT
POD1000000021_S0000445	NO BIG DEAL I'D HAVE TO TAKE ON MY FACE IF I DIDN'T HAVE TO SEE
POD1000000021_S0000446	ON OCTOBER NINETEEN NINETEEN NINETY ONE DUKE'S FANS GATHERED AT THE PONTCHATRAIN CENTER IN HIS HOME TERRITORY OF JEFFERSON PARISH
POD1000000021_S0000447	THEY WERE TREATED TO A SHORT PERFORMANCE BY THAT BLONDE WOMAN IN THE BLUE DRESS WHO SANG AT LOTS OF DUKE'S RALLIES
POD1000000021_S0000449	AFTER DIXY CAME A PRAYER
POD1000000021_S0000450	WE ASK THAT YOU GUIDE OUR LEADERS AND THAT THEY MIGHT GOVERN WITH COMPASSION AND LOVE AND UNDERSTANDING
POD1000000021_S0000451	WE ASK FOR SPECIAL BLESSING UPON THIS ASSEMBLY
POD1000000021_S0000452	AND THAT WHICH IS DONE HERE WILL BE ULTIMATELY TO THE GLORY OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD
POD1000000021_S0000453	AND THEN DAVID DUKE HIMSELF TOOK THE STAGE
POD1000000021_S0000454	WITH EVERY MINUTE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IT APPEARS THAT WE WILL BE IN A RUNOFF FOR THE GOVERNORSHIP OF LOUISIANA
POD1000000021_S0000456	BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE AT DUKE'S FIRST VICTORY PARTY HE SHOUTED ABOUT WINNING A STATE HOUSE SEAT WITHOUT ANY BIG POLITICAL ENDORSEMENTS
POD1000000021_S0000457	HE ALSO COMPLAINED ABOUT THE MEDIA AND THE POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT AND WINE THAT HE WAS ALWAYS GETTING LIED ABOUT
POD1000000021_S0000458	IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE HE DIDN'T SOUND BITTER OR VENGEFUL
POD1000000021_S0000459	THIS DAVID DUKE WAS SMOOTH HUMBLE CONCILIATORY
POD1000000021_S0000460	HE'D FIGURED OUT HOW HE WAS SUPPOSED TO SOUND AND HOW TO MAKE AN APPEAL THAT WASN'T ENTIRELY BASED ON GRIEVANCE
POD1000000021_S0000461	MY THANKS GOES FIRST TO THE FORCE OF MY LIFE THAT'S GIVEN ME STRENGTH AND HELPED ME
POD1000000021_S0000463	WITHSTAND A LOT AND CONTINUE TO STAND UP FOR YOU
POD1000000021_S0000464	AND THAT'S JESUS CHRIST LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
POD1000000021_S0000467	DAVID DUKE WAS IN THE RUNOFF WITH THIRTY TWO PERCENT OF THE VOTE
POD1000000021_S0000468	DUKE FINISHED JUST TWO POINTS BEHIND THE LEADER
POD1000000021_S0000469	EDWIN EDWARDS BUDDY ROMER'S POLITICAL CONSULTANT RAYMOND STRETHER KNEW HIS MAN WAS GOING TO COME IN THIRD
POD1000000021_S0000470	HE WENT TO BED AT THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION BEFORE THE RACE GOT CALLED
POD1000000021_S0000471	AND THE NEXT MORNING I GOT UP AND WENT DOWN TO GET MY COOKIES AND MILK
POD1000000021_S0000472	AND BUDDY WAS DOWN THERE AND HE SAID WELL YOU DIDN'T HAVE A GOOD CANDIDATE DID YOU
POD1000000021_S0000473	I SAID MUST NOT HAVE BUDDY
POD1000000021_S0000474	HE SAID WELL WE TOOK OUR BEST SHOT AND HE WALKED OUT THAT'S THE LAST TIME I'VE EVER SPOKEN TO
POD1000000021_S0000475	BUDDY ROMER FINISHED FIVE POINTS BEHIND DAVID DUKE
POD1000000021_S0000476	ULTIMATELY HE WASN'T TAKEN DOWN BY AN ELECTORAL CONSPIRACY
POD1000000021_S0000477	HE'D LOST BECAUSE LOUISIANA DIDN'T WANT A REFORMER
POD1000000021_S0000478	AND TONIGHT THE PEOPLE SPOKE AND THEY SAID BUDDY THANKS BUT YOU DIDN'T DO ENOUGH AND I THINK THAT'S FAIR
POD1000000021_S0000479	WHEN MICHELLE SHOWER STARTED WORKING ON THE CAMPAIGN SHE'D BEEN INSPIRED BY BUDDY ROMER'S ENERGY
POD1000000021_S0000480	BUT NOW THAT IT WAS OVER SHE THOUGHT ROMER ACTUALLY SEEMED RELIEVED
POD1000000021_S0000481	SHE FOUND HER OWN FEELINGS HARDER TO PIN DOWN
POD1000000021_S0000482	SHE WAS THINKING ABOUT LEAVING THE STATE MAYBE GOING TO LIVE WITH HER PARENTS IN MONTANA
POD1000000021_S0000483	BUT THEN SHE GOT APPROACHED BY SOME PEOPLE SHE KNEW FROM THE LOUISIANA REPUBLICAN PARTY
POD1000000021_S0000484	THEY SAID WE HAVE AN OFFER FOR YOU BEFORE YOU REJECT IT OUTRIGHT
POD1000000021_S0000485	JUST LISTEN TO US AND THEY SAID YOU COULD GO TO WORK ON DAVID DUKE'S CAMPAIGN
POD1000000021_S0000486	OF COURSE MY EYES WIDEN LIKE ARE YOU CRAZY
POD1000000021_S0000487	SHOWER HAD NEVER CONSIDERED SUPPORTING DAVID DUKE MUCH LESS WORKING FOR HIM
POD1000000021_S0000488	HER FAMILY HAD BEEN ON GOVERNMENT AID WHEN SHE WAS GROWING UP SO HIS RANT AGAINST WELFARE WEREN'T PERSUASIVE
POD1000000021_S0000489	BUT SHOWER REALLY DIDN'T WANT EDWIN EDWARDS BACK IN CHARGE OF LOUISIANA
POD1000000021_S0000490	PLUS THOSE PEOPLE FROM THE STATE PARTY TOLD HER THAT SHE DIDN'T NEED TO TAKE A PUBLIC FACING ROLE
POD1000000021_S0000491	THAT SHE COULD STAY IN THE SHADOWS
POD1000000021_S0000492	SHOWER AGREED TO MEET WITH DUKE'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER HOWE FARRELL
POD1000000021_S0000493	WHEN THEY GOT TOGETHER HE SAID THAT THE TIME HAD COME TO BROADEN THE DUKE OPERATION BY BRINGING IN PEOPLE FROM THE ESTABLISHMENT
POD1000000021_S0000494	SHE WANTED TO BE A CAMPAIGN MANAGER SOMEDAY
POD1000000021_S0000495	AND SHE LIKED THE IDEA OF LEARNING FROM ONE SHE WAS ALSO UNEMPLOYED
POD1000000021_S0000496	SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I HAD A JOB AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT AN ALTERNATE CAMPAIGN AND THAT'S HOW I STARTED
POD1000000021_S0000498	DURING HER STINT AS A DUKE STAFFER MICHELLE SHOWER WOULD HEAR THINGS THAT SHOCKED HER
POD1000000021_S0000499	SHE'D ALSO MAKE A LOT OF PHONE CALLS ON BEHALF OF DAVID DUKE USING A LIST SHE BROUGHT WITH HER FROM THE ROMER CAMPAIGN
POD1000000021_S0000500	THAT LIST WAS THE MAIN REASON THE DUKE CAMPAIGN HAD HIRED SHOWER
POD1000000021_S0000501	ROME'S SUPPORTERS WERE NOW UP FOR GRABS IF THEY VOTED REPUBLICAN IN THE NOVEMBER RUNOFF
POD1000000021_S0000502	THEN DAVID DUKE WAS GOING TO BE THE GOVERNOR OF LOUISIANA
POD1000000021_S0000503	THE STATE REPUBLICAN PARTY WAS STILL NOT GOING TO SUPPORT DUKE PUBLICLY BUT HE WAS THE LAST REPUBLICAN STANDING
POD1000000021_S0000504	AND WHEN SHE TALKED TO HER FRIENDS IN THE PARTY THEY SAID THEY KNEW HOW TO KEEP DUKE UNDER CONTROL
POD1000000021_S0000505	WHEN I WOULD HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS THEY WOULD SAY YOU KNOW THERE'S NOT MUCH HE CAN DO
POD1000000021_S0000506	HE'S GONNA HAVE SO MANY EYES ON HIM IF HE WINS
POD1000000021_S0000507	THERE'S SO MANY EYES WE'RE GONNA HAVE PEOPLE AROUND HIM
POD1000000021_S0000508	HE WON'T BE ABLE TO PUSH FORWARD ANY OF THESE AGENDAS FROM HIS PAST
POD1000000021_S0000509	HE'LL HAVE TO STICK TO THE POLICIES
POD1000000021_S0000510	AND AT THAT TIME I BELIEVED THEM
POD1000000021_S0000511	AND AT THAT TIME I THOUGHT WHILE I WASN'T REALLY WILLING TO SAY I WAS FOR HIM I WAS MORE FOR SWEEPING IN A REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR TO TRY TO FIX THINGS IN LOUISIANA
POD1000000021_S0000512	THAT'S REALLY WHERE I WAS COMING FROM AT THAT TIME

POD1000000021_S0000531	THANKS FOR LISTENING
POD1000000023_S0000000	HELLO EVERYONE I'M STEPHEN WEST THIS IS PHILOSOPHIZE THIS THANK YOU TO EVERYONE THAT CONTINUES TO SUPPORT THE SHOW ON PATREON A SPECIAL THANK YOU TO THOSE OF YOU THAT UPPED YOUR PLEDGE DURING THESE UNCERTAIN TIMES
POD1000000023_S0000001	I'M BEYOND GRATEFUL AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE UP ANY MORE OF YOUR TIME TODAY'S EPISODE ON THE POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OF RICHARD RORTY I HOPE YOU LOVE THE SHOW TODAY
POD1000000023_S0000003	IF YOU'RE HAVING A POLITICAL DISCUSSION WITH SOMEONE AND THE CONVERSATION TOOK A TURN AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU GUYS ARE TALKING ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS
POD1000000023_S0000004	THERE'S CERTAINLY A LOT OF DIFFERENT ANGLES YOU COULD APPROACH THAT DISCUSSION FROM BUT ONE OF THE MOST COMMON ONES MIGHT BE WHAT PHILOSOPHICAL GROUNDING CAN WE GIVE TO SOMETHING LIKE HUMAN RIGHTS
POD1000000023_S0000005	I MEAN WE ALL THINK HUMAN BEINGS HAVE RIGHTS BUT WHERE EXACTLY DO THOSE RIGHTS COME FROM WHO OR WHAT OUT THERE GUARANTEES THESE RIGHTS FOR PEOPLE
POD1000000023_S0000006	WELL A COMMON ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION MIGHT BE THAT HUMAN RIGHTS ARE INHERITED BY BIRTHRIGHT SIMPLY BY VIRTUE OF BEING BORN EVERY HUMAN BEING IS ENTITLED TO CERTAIN NATURAL RIGHTS OR INALIENABLE RIGHTS
POD1000000023_S0000007	RIGHTS THAT PROTECT THE DIGNITY OF A HUMAN LIFE AT SUCH A BASIC LEVEL THAT TO GO AGAINST THEM STARTS TO SEEM LIKE YOU'D BE GOING AGAINST NATURE
POD1000000023_S0000008	NOW AS FAR AS THE PHILOSOPHICAL GROUNDING IS CONCERNED THIS IS AN ATTITUDE MUCH MORE COMMON DURING THE BEGINNING OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT THAN IT IS TODAY
POD1000000023_S0000009	AND THE TWO MAIN THINKERS THAT TOOK ON THIS POSITION ARE OFTEN CITED TO BE JOHN LOCK AND EMANUEL KANT
POD1000000023_S0000010	WHEN IT COMES TO ANSWERING THE QUESTION OF WHO OR WHAT GUARANTEES THESE HUMAN RIGHTS JOHN LOCK GOES IN THE DIRECTION OF GOD YOU KNOW WE ARE ENDOWED BY OUR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN INALIENABLE RIGHTS
POD1000000023_S0000011	AND KANT GOES MORE IN THE DIRECTION OF A PRIORI FACTS DERIVED FROM REASON BUT EITHER WAY THESE THINKERS ARE IN THEIR OWN WAY TRYING TO USE REASON TO ARRIVE AT A UNIVERSAL THAT GUARANTEES HUMAN BEINGS ARE BORN WITH NATURAL RIGHTS
POD1000000023_S0000012	LITTLE DID EITHER OF THESE THINKERS KNOW THAT JUST A HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS LATER WE'D BE IMMERSED IN TWO WORLD WARS THAT WOULD MAKE THE ARGUMENT FOR THE NATURAL RIGHTS OF HUMAN BEINGS SEEM ABOUT AS IMPORTANT AS NECK RUFFLES WERE TO THEM
POD1000000023_S0000013	AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ON THIS SHOW THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY WAS FULL OF THINKERS DISSATISFIED WITH WHAT THE ENLIGHTENMENT HAD PRODUCED THEY EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT THE ENTIRE PROJECT OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT WAS DESTINED TO CONSUME ITSELF FROM THE START
POD1000000023_S0000014	YEAH SURE AT THE BEGINNING REASON CALLS INTO QUESTION MUCH OF THE RELIGIOUS DOGMA OF THE MIDDLE AGES BUT WHAT INEVITABLY HAS TO HAPPEN ONCE IT GETS DONE WITH THAT JOB IS REASON HAS TO START QUESTIONING THE NEW FOUNDATIONS FOR THINGS
POD1000000023_S0000015	REASON HAS TO START QUESTIONING ITSELF WHICH THEN LEADS TO PHILOSOPHERS USING THE PROCESS OF RATIONALITY TO FIND OUT THAT RATIONALITY IS NOT SOME UNBIASED A HISTORICAL MEASURING TOOL
POD1000000023_S0000016	IT'S NOT SOME NEUTRAL POINT FROM WHICH WE CAN MAKE UNAMBIGUOUS CLAIMS ABOUT THE TRUTH OF HUMAN RIGHTS OR MORE IMPORTANTLY THE UNIVERSE TO THE THINKER WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT TODAY RICHARD RORTY
POD1000000023_S0000017	PEOPLE LIKE LOCK AND KANT WERE NO MORE DISCOVERING A TRUTH ABOUT WHAT GROUNDS HUMAN RIGHTS THAN HAMMURABI WAS BEFORE THEM
POD1000000023_S0000018	BUT UNLIKE MANY OF THE THINKERS OF THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY WHO MAY HAVE FELT A BIT DISENFRANCHISED BY THE RATIONAL PROCESS RICHARD RORTY FELT OPTIMISTIC ABOUT RATIONALITY
POD1000000023_S0000019	SOME PEOPLE CALLED A POST MODERNIST WHICH WOULD USUALLY PLACE HIM IN STAUNCH OPPOSITION TO ANYTHING THAT EVEN SOUNDS LIKE THE WORD ENLIGHTENMENT
POD1000000023_S0000020	LIKE EXCITEMENT BUT LET ME TELL YOU READY WAS A VERY EXCITING MAN HE REJECTED THE TITLE OF POST MODERNIST AND MOST TITLES FOR THAT MATTER
POD1000000023_S0000021	HE OPERATED IN A VERY UNIQUE REALM FOR A THINKER WHERE LIKE A TYPICAL POST STRUCTURALIST HE DIDN'T BELIEVE IN ANY SORT OF GRAND NARRATIVE THAT COULD EXPLAIN AWAY THE UNIVERSE
POD1000000023_S0000022	BUT YET HE WAS STILL A DIEHARD CARD CARRYING FAN OF THE PROJECT OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT OVERALL
POD1000000023_S0000023	IN A WORLD WHERE THERE'S SO MANY TWENTIETH CENTURY THINKERS HATING ON THE ENLIGHTENMENT HERE'S A GUY SOME PEOPLE VIEWED AS A POST STRUCTURALIST COMING TO ITS DEFENSE
POD1000000023_S0000024	LET ME EXPLAIN WHY HE'D EVEN DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS
POD1000000023_S0000025	WHEN EMANUEL KANT IN HIS FAMOUS ESSAY DESCRIBES THE ENLIGHTENMENT AS MAN'S REMOVAL OF HIS SELF INCURRED TUTELAGE YEAH HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE TUTELAGE OF THE RELIGIOUS DOGMA OF THE PAST
POD1000000023_S0000026	BUT ROADY WOULD EXTEND THAT TUTELAGE TO THE RATIONAL DOGMA THAT WAS TO COME IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE OF HOW OVERAMBITIOUS WE WERE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT ABOUT WHAT RATIONALITY COULD PRODUCE
POD1000000023_S0000027	THE SPIRIT OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT RORTY WAS NOT TO USE REASON TO ARRIVE AT THE TRUTH ABOUT THE UNIVERSE
POD1000000023_S0000028	IT WAS ULTIMATELY A CALL TO SUBVERT TRADITIONAL FORMS OF AUTHORITY THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT WAS NOT TO LAND ON NEW ANSWERS
POD1000000023_S0000029	IT WAS TO QUESTION OLD ASSUMPTIONS SO IN THAT SENSE YEAH THE INITIAL PROJECT OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT ULTIMATELY CONSUMED ITSELF
POD1000000023_S0000030	BUT TO RICHARD RORTY THE INITIAL PROJECT OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT WAS MEANT TO CONSUME ITSELF THINKERS LIKE ISAIAH BERLIN THAT WOULD COME ALONG AND SUGGEST A PLURALISTIC VISION OF THINGS
POD1000000023_S0000031	THIS WASN'T AN ANTI ENLIGHTENMENT IDEA AT ALL TO ROUTE THIS WAS THE PROJECT OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT LEFT TO PLAY ITSELF OUT
POD1000000023_S0000032	THINKERS LIKE BERLIN WERE ALWAYS GOING TO EVENTUALLY COME ALONG
POD1000000023_S0000033	SEE THE PROJECT OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT MATURING THROUGH PEOPLE LIKE ISAIAH BERLIN TAUGHT US A COUPLE OF EXTREMELY VALUABLE INSIGHTS
POD1000000023_S0000034	ONE OF WHICH WAS THAT WE DON'T NEED TO TRY TO USE REASON TO APPEAL TO SOME ULTIMATE AUTHORITY OR UNIVERSAL TO GROUND OUR IDEAS
POD1000000023_S0000035	RATIONALITY IS NOT A TOOL THAT GETS US TO OBJECTIVITY ABOUT THINGS
POD1000000023_S0000036	BUT IT MAY GET US A VERY EFFECTIVE MIX OF INTERSUBJECTIVITY BETWEEN CULTURES
POD1000000023_S0000037	WORD WANTS TO OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE WAY OF LOOKING AT THE LEGACY OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT
POD1000000023_S0000038	MAYBE IT IS POINTLESS TO TRY TO DO OUR BEST IMPRESSIONS OF LOCK AND KANT AND TO TRY TO ACCESS THE UNIVERSE THROUGH REASON
POD1000000023_S0000039	BUT WHEN IT COMES TO STRICTLY HUMAN INSTITUTIONS FOR EXAMPLE THE POLITICAL REALM WHERE WE'RE NOT TRYING TO ACCESS THINGS IN THEMSELVES
POD1000000023_S0000040	WE'RE JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN LIVE TOGETHER THE BEST MAYBE THAT IS WHERE RATIONALITY THRIVES AS A METHOD
POD1000000023_S0000041	WHAT ALL THIS IS ALLUDING TO IS THE FACT THAT HUMAN RIGHTS ARE NOT THE ONLY THINGS PHILOSOPHERS HAVE TRIED TO GROUND IN UNIVERSALS IN THE PAST
POD1000000023_S0000042	THE VERY STRUCTURE OF SOME POLITICAL SYSTEMS LIBERALISM FOR EXAMPLE HAS ALSO HISTORICALLY BEEN GROUNDED IN UNIVERSAL
POD1000000023_S0000043	ONCE AGAIN I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY BECAUSE THERE'S SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT GET ANGRY VERY QUICKLY
POD1000000023_S0000044	AND THEY ALSO MUST BE PART OF SOME SORT OF EMAIL CLUB THAT'S OUT THERE
POD1000000023_S0000045	WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LIBERALISM AS A FOUNDATION FOR SOCIETY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A GOVERNMENT WITH A FOCUS ON INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED AND AVERSION TO ANY SORT OF COLLECTIVIST SYSTEM OR SYSTEMS THAT WERE POPULAR AT OTHER POINTS IN HISTORY MAYBE A CASTE SYSTEM FOR EXAMPLE
POD1000000023_S0000046	NOW YOU CAN IMAGINE IF YOU'RE A PHILOSOPHER AND YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE A CASE FOR LIBERALISM BEING BETTER THAN A CASTE SYSTEM
POD1000000023_S0000047	MIGHT BE TEMPTING TO START TO MAKE AN ARGUMENT THAT HUMAN BEINGS AT THE LEVEL OF THE UNIVERSE ARE ALL EQUAL AND THEREFORE SHOULD NOT BE RELEGATED TO DIFFERENT RANKS WITHIN A SOCIETY
POD1000000023_S0000048	BUT TO ROADY THIS WOULD BE MAKING THE SAME MISTAKE THAT LOCK AND KANT MADE IN OUR EXAMPLE FROM BEFORE ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS
POD1000000023_S0000049	THE FACT IS TO ROADY WE DON'T NEED THAT SORT OF ULTIMATE FOUNDATION TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A CASE FOR THE FACT THAT LIBERALISM IS HOW WE SHOULD BE RUNNING THINGS
POD1000000023_S0000050	FOR MANY DIFFERENT REASONS ONE LIKE WE ALREADY SAID WE CAN'T ACTUALLY ACCESS THE UNIVERSE AT THAT LEVEL THROUGH RATIONALITY
POD1000000023_S0000051	TWO SOCIETY IS JUST FAR BETTER OFF WHEN IT CAN BASE PUBLIC POLICY ON THE RATIONAL CONSENSUS OF INDIVIDUAL CITIZENS RATHER THAN A PHILOSOPHICAL THEORY ARRIVED AT BY SOME GUY IN A TOWER THAT PEOPLE MIGHT NOT EVEN BE ABLE TO RELATE TO
POD1000000023_S0000052	THINK OF THE LIMITATIONS YOU INSTANTLY PLACE ON YOURSELF IF YOU DECIDE THAT EVERY PUBLIC POLICY OR VALUE OF A SOCIETY NEEDS TO BE GROUNDED IN SOME PHILOSOPHICAL JUSTIFICATION THAT TELLS YOU HOW HUMAN BEINGS ARE AT LARGE
POD1000000023_S0000053	FIRST OF ALL LET'S SAY YOU DECIDED TO STRUCTURE YOUR SOCIETY AROUND THE POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OF PLATO
POD1000000023_S0000054	YOU'RE SOON GOING TO FIND YOURSELF ON A CONSTANT PR CAMPAIGN TRYING TO CONTINUOUSLY SELL THESE IDEAS TO A POPULATION JUST CROSSING YOUR FINGERS AS THEY GO ALONG WITH IT
POD1000000023_S0000055	SECOND OF ALL ALMOST ALWAYS THESE PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS THAT YOU MIGHT STRUCTURE YOUR SOCIETY AROUND WERE CREATED IN AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT CULTURE THAT EMERGED OUT OF AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT HISTORY
POD1000000023_S0000056	WHICH MEANS THESE THEORIES CAN BRING A LOT OF BAGGAGE ALONG WITH THEM THAT YOU MAY NOT WANT IN THE PRESENT CULTURE
POD1000000023_S0000057	THIRDLY YOU ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE FIGHTING A SORT OF LOSING BATTLE TO RATE BECAUSE YOU WILL ALWAYS BE TRYING TO CRAM ONE INTERPRETATION OF HOW HUMAN LIFE SHOULD BE STRUCTURED INTO THE ENORMOUSLY COMPLEX PLURALISTIC MAIL STREAM OF PEOPLE COEXISTING TOGETHER
POD1000000023_S0000058	RUDY IS ESSENTIALLY SAYING MAYBE WE DON'T NEED THE PHILOSOPHER UP IN THE TOWER THINKING ALL DAY TELLING US HOW TO STRUCTURE OUR SOCIETIES BECAUSE WELL I'VE DECIDED IT SHORES UP WITH HOW THE UNIVERSE IS
POD1000000023_S0000059	MAYBE WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE WAY THE UNIVERSE IS BUT MAYBE THAT DOESN'T MATTER MAYBE WE DON'T NEED SOME ELABORATE PHILOSOPHICAL THEORY TO STRUCTURE OUR SOCIETY FOR US MAYBE A STRATEGY IS LEGITIMATE
POD1000000023_S0000060	LIBERALISM FOR INSTANCE IF THE CITIZENS OF A PARTICULAR CULTURE POSITIONED IN HISTORY AT A PARTICULAR TIME AND PLACE ALL THE CITIZENS FACING A VERY SPECIFIC SET OF COMMON PROBLEMS THAT THEY NEED TO SOLVE
POD1000000023_S0000061	MAYBE A STRATEGY IS LEGITIMATE IF THE PEOPLE OF THAT SOCIETY DECIDE THAT THEY HAVE CONFIDENCE IN IT BECAUSE ONE THING'S FOR SURE ONE ULTIMATE THEORY IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH
POD1000000023_S0000062	READY WHO WAS A HUGE FAN OF ISAIAH BERLIN SOMETIMES TALKS IN HIS WORK ABOUT THE FACT OF PLURALISM
POD1000000023_S0000063	THIS IS WHAT A SOCIETY IS TORTI WE ARE WORSE OFF AS A SOCIETY IF WE TRY TO USE A SINGLE RELIGIOUS OR PHILOSOPHICAL THEORY TO JUSTIFY OUR POLITICAL STRATEGY
POD1000000023_S0000064	YOU WILL ALWAYS BE FIGHTING A LOSING BATTLE PEOPLE WILL ALWAYS ARRIVE AT A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS
POD1000000023_S0000065	SO INSTEAD OF EMBARKING ON A NEVER ENDING SALES CAMPAIGN FOR AN IDEA WORD SUGGESTS THAT WE ALLOW OUR POLITICAL STRATEGY TO REFLECT THE COMMON VALUES OF THE PEOPLE THAT MAKE UP THE CULTURE
POD1000000023_S0000066	HE WRITES ABOUT HOW IF WE DO THIS AND WE'RE CAREFUL EVENTUALLY IF YOU WERE HAVING THAT SAME CONVERSATION AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE AND YOU ASK SOMEBODY WHAT GROUNDS HUMAN RIGHTS
POD1000000023_S0000067	THE COMMON TENDENCY WON'T BE TO TRY TO APPEAL TO SOMETHING WRITTEN INTO THE UNIVERSE OR TO CITE SOME RELIGIOUS OR PHILOSOPHICAL JUSTIFICATION YOU READ IN A BOOK SOMEWHERE
POD1000000023_S0000068	THE NEW STANDARD WILL BE FOR PEOPLE TO SEE SOCIAL POLICY AS LEGITIMATE IF IT WAS APPROVED BY THE PEOPLE ACTUALLY LIVING IN THE CULTURE
POD1000000023_S0000069	WHEN ASKED THE QUESTION WHAT GROUNDS THIS PIECE OF SOCIAL POLICY THE ANSWER WON'T INVOLVE POINTING TO SOME PHILOSOPHER FROM THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO
POD1000000023_S0000070	YOU KNOW DECKARD'S FAMOUS WORK A TREATISE CONCERNING WHY DRUGS SHOULD BE LEGALIZED AND WHY YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE YOUR CELL PHONE ON AN AIRPLANE NO NO
POD1000000023_S0000071	THE AUTHORITY LIES IN THE HANDS OF THE SET OF PEOPLE POSITIONED IN HISTORY WITH A VERY SPECIFIC SET OF PROBLEMS TO SOLVE THAT THEY CARE ABOUT
POD1000000023_S0000072	AND ONCE AGAIN TO RORTY NOT ONLY DO WE NOT NEED ANY MORE AUTHORITY THAN THAT WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO ANY AUTHORITY OTHER THAN THAT AND WE'RE BETTER OFF THIS WAY ANYWAY
POD1000000023_S0000073	SHOULD BE SAID THIS IS YET ANOTHER WAY WE CAN ACCESS AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION OF HOW WE CAN FIND A BRIDGE BETWEEN NATURE AND CULTURE
POD1000000023_S0000074	RODE OBVIOUSLY IS NOT APPEALING TO A SINGLE THEORY BUT HE ALSO IS NOT APPEALING TO PURE RELATIVISM OR HISTORICISM
POD1000000023_S0000075	HIS ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW WE CAN JUSTIFY OUR POLITICAL STRATEGY PLACE HIM IN WHAT I THINK IS THE MOST ACCURATE CATEGORY TO DESCRIBE SOME OF HIS BIGGEST IDEAS
POD1000000023_S0000076	RUDY IS OFTEN THOUGHT OF AS A PRAGMATIST AND I THINK WE CAN UNDERSTAND RORTY'S OVERALL POSITION A LITTLE BIT BETTER IF WE TAKE A SECOND TO TALK ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF TRUTH
POD1000000023_S0000077	MORE SPECIFICALLY THE KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TRADITIONAL WAYS PEOPLE HAVE VIEWED THE CONCEPT OF TRUTH AND THE WAY A PRAGMATIST LIKE RUDY WOULD HE VIEWED THE CONCEPT OF TRUTH
POD1000000023_S0000078	SO LET'S TALK FIRST ABOUT ONE OF THE MOST COMMON THEORIES OF WHAT CONSTITUTES TRUTH FROM THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY ONE THAT RICHARD RORTY THOUGHT HAS BEEN DOMINANT SINCE THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT
POD1000000023_S0000079	WHAT HE SOMETIMES CALLS THE REPRESENTATIONALIST PARADIGM SOMETIMES CALLED BY OTHERS THE CORRESPONDENCE THEORY OF TRUTH BUT LET ME TAKE A SECOND TO TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT IT IS
POD1000000023_S0000080	THE MOST BASIC IDEA IS SUPPOSE SOMEBODY SAYS A STATEMENT ABOUT THE WAY THINGS ARE IN THE WORLD HOW DO WE TELL IF THAT STATEMENT IS TRUE
POD1000000023_S0000081	WELL THAT STATEMENT IS TRUE IF IT REPRESENTS THE WAY THINGS REALLY ARE IN THE WORLD IF THERE'S A CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE DESCRIPTION AND REALITY THEN WE CAN SAY IT'S TRUE
POD1000000023_S0000082	NOW THERE'S OF COURSE MOUNTAINS OF DETAIL THAT WE COULD TALK ABOUT HERE BUT RICHARD BRODY DISAGREES WITH THE ENTIRE PREMISE OF THE CORRESPONDENCE THEORY EVEN AT THIS BASIC RUDIMENTARY LEVEL
POD1000000023_S0000083	WHENEVER YOU TRY TO CREATE A BRIDGE BETWEEN A DESCRIPTION YOU HAVE IN YOUR HEAD AND THE REALITY OF THE WORLD THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN EVER DESCRIBE ANYTHING IS THROUGH LANGUAGE
POD1000000023_S0000084	LANGUAGE MEDIATES OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH REALITY YOU CAN'T ACCESS REALITY WITHOUT LANGUAGE BUT TO READ IT EVEN GOES ONE STEP FURTHER THAN THIS
POD1000000023_S0000085	NOT ONLY IS LANGUAGE A MEDIUM BETWEEN US AND REALITY BUT LANGUAGE ACTUALLY CONSTITUTES REALITY
POD1000000023_S0000086	MEANING THAT THE LANGUAGE WE USE AND THE WAY WE USE IT CHANGES THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT REALITY
POD1000000023_S0000087	THIS COULD BE AN ENTIRE SERIES ON ITS OWN BUT THE POINT IS THAT CERTAIN LANGUAGES AND THE CULTURES THAT USE THEM FAVOR CERTAIN HABITS OF INTERPRETING EVENTS
POD1000000023_S0000088	THESE INTERPRETATIONS GREATLY DETERMINE THE ENTIRE WAY WE SEE REALITY AND THE WAY HUMAN BEINGS PERCEIVE REALITY VARIES GREATLY FROM CULTURE TO CULTURE LANGUAGE TO LANGUAGE
POD1000000023_S0000089	SO THE IDEA THAT THERE'S SOME SORT OF CORRESPONDENCE OR REPRESENTATION GOING ON THAT THE WORLD OUT THERE IS SOMEHOW HELPING US VERIFY WHETHER STATEMENTS ARE TRUE OR FALSE
POD1000000023_S0000090	THAT'S JUST WRONG BECAUSE ROADY THINKS IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO EVER STEP OUTSIDE THE PARAMETERS OF LANGUAGE AND ACCESS THE WORLD OF THINGS IN THEMSELVES THINGS INDEPENDENT OF THIS LANGUAGE THAT WE USE TO CATEGORIZE THEM
POD1000000023_S0000091	HE'S A VERY FAMOUS QUOTE THAT WILL BE EXTREMELY USEFUL FOR US FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE EPISODE HE SAID QUOTE THE WORLD DOES NOT SPEAK ONLY WE DO
POD1000000023_S0000092	THE WORLD CAN ONCE WE HAVE PROGRAMMED OURSELVES WITH A LANGUAGE CAUSE US TO HOLD BELIEFS BUT IT CANNOT PROPOSE A LANGUAGE FOR US TO SPEAK ONLY HUMAN BEINGS CAN DO THAT END QUOTE
POD1000000023_S0000093	SO IT SHOULD BE SAID ROAD'S NOT TALKING ABOUT ORDINARY LANGUAGE WHEN HE WRITES THAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET DEEP INTO HERE IN A MINUTE BUT I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS COMPARISON HE'S MAKING HERE
POD1000000023_S0000094	BETWEEN ACCESSING THE WORLD VERSUS SOME SORT OF HUMAN CREATED TOOL THAT'S DEEPLY AFFECTED BY THE BONDS OF HISTORY AND CULTURE
POD1000000023_S0000095	THIS IS A CLASSIC MOVE THAT ROWNY MAKES THAT IF YOU ARE NEW TO ROADY MIGHT HELP YOU UNDERSTAND AN OUTLINE OF SOME OF THE TOPICS HE WANTS TO COVER FOR EXAMPLE LANGUAGE IS EXTREMELY USEFUL IN HUMAN AFFAIRS
POD1000000023_S0000096	IT'S JUST NOT CAPABLE OF DESCRIBING THE WORLD OF THINGS IN THEMSELVES OUTSIDE OF LANGUAGE
POD1000000023_S0000097	WE'LL CONSIDER HOW THIS COMPARES TO THE BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE WE HAVE LOCK AND KANT TRYING TO USE REASON TO ACCESS SOME SORT OF ULTIMATE TRUTH ABOUT THE UNIVERSE BUT HERE'S ROADY SAYING THAT RATIONALITY IS MOST USEFUL IN HUMAN AFFAIRS LIKE THE REALM OF THE POLITICAL
POD1000000023_S0000098	THE WORLD DOES NOT SPEAK ONLY WE DO HERE'S ANOTHER ONE FROM THE ENLIGHTENMENT PEOPLE LIKE ROUSSEAU WHO BELIEVE IN SOME SORT OF UNDERLYING HUMAN NATURE NOBLE SAVAGES AS HE WOULD SAY
POD1000000023_S0000099	REALLY BEYOND THAT ANYONE THAT WANTS TO TAKE UP THE MANTLE OF THE COMMON ATTITUDE THAT HUMAN BEINGS AT THEIR VERY CORE DREAD SEEING OTHER HUMAN BEINGS SUFFER
POD1000000023_S0000100	THAT'S A COMMON ONE FOR PEOPLE TO HOLD THAT NATURALLY AS HUMAN BEINGS WE DON'T WANT TO SEE OTHER PEOPLE IN PAIN SO WE CAN RELY ON THE FACT THAT IF THINGS EVER GOT BAD ENOUGH ONE CULTURE WOULD ALWAYS COME TO THE AID OF ANOTHER CULTURE
POD1000000023_S0000101	RODY ACTUALLY RESPONDS TO THIS POSITION DIRECTLY IN AN INTERACTION WITH SIMON CRITCHLEY IN THE NINETY S SO RIGHT HERE HE'S REFERENCING THE IDEA THAT THERE'S SOME SORT OF DEFAULT ALTRUISM EMBEDDED INTO HUMAN NATURE
POD1000000023_S0000102	HE SAYS MAYBE THERE IS SUCH A SENTIENT DISPOSITION BUT IT IS SO MALLEABLE SO CAPABLE OF BEING COMBINED WITH INDIFFERENCE TO THE SUFFERING OF PEOPLE OF THE WRONG SORT THAT IT GIVES US PRECIOUS LITTLE TO RELY ON
POD1000000023_S0000103	WE SHOULD JUST THANK OUR LUCKY STARS THAT THERE ARE QUITE A LOT OF PEOPLE NOWADAYS WHO ARE PRETTY CONSISTENTLY APPALLED BY HUMAN BEINGS SUFFERING UNNECESSARILY END QUOTE
POD1000000023_S0000104	SO HE'S SAYING MAYBE THERE IS SOME ASPECT OF HUMAN NATURE THAT MAKES PEOPLE NOT WANT TO SEE OTHERS SUFFER BUT IF THERE IS IT'S INCREDIBLY MALLEABLE
POD1000000023_S0000105	THANK YOUR LUCKY STARS THAT THERE HAPPEN TO BE A LOT OF PEOPLE LIVING TODAY WHO DON'T WANT TO SEE UNNECESSARY SUFFERING BUT THE LARGER POINT THERE IS THAT ALSO IF YOU'RE A FAN OF LIBERALISM
POD1000000023_S0000106	THERE IS NOTHING WRITTEN INTO NATURE LIKE A GOD OR A PRIORI FACTS THAT SAY LIBERALISM IS THE WAY
POD1000000023_S0000107	BUT THANK YOUR LUCKY STARS FOR THE LAST COUPLE HUNDRED YEARS THERE'VE BEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT BELIEVE IN IT AS A STRATEGY
POD1000000023_S0000108	SO WHILE WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE MOVE THAT ROAD IS MAKING HERE
POD1000000023_S0000109	PLACING A LOT OF AUTHORITY IN THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE ACTUALLY IMMERSED IN THE CULTURE THIS MAY START TO BRING UP A WHOLE NEW SET OF QUESTIONS ONE OF THE MOST PRESSING MIGHT BE THIS
POD1000000023_S0000110	IF THE AUTHORITY OF WHETHER A SOCIAL POLICY IS GOOD OR NOT LIES IN THE HANDS OF THE CITIZENS AND NOT EVEN A PHILOSOPHER CAN ARRIVE AT ABSOLUTE FOUNDATIONS FOR EVEN SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS HUMAN RIGHTS
POD1000000023_S0000111	DON'T THOSE CRITICISMS JUST INSTANTLY EXTEND TO MY BELIEFS AS AN INDIVIDUAL
POD1000000023_S0000112	LIKE HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GROUND MY WORLDVIEW IN ANYTHING THAT'S ENDURING ENOUGH THAT I CAN FEEL CONFIDENT ABOUT IT
POD1000000023_S0000113	THE SHORT ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION IS THAT YOU CAN'T AND THAT SHOULDN'T BOTHER YOU
POD1000000023_S0000114	THE LONGER ANSWER CAN BE FOUND IN RODY'S LENGTHY EXPLORATION OF THE CONCEPT OF IRONY
POD1000000023_S0000115	LET'S TALK ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW SO A COMMON EMAIL I GET IS FROM A PERSON WHO SAYS SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF THIS
POD1000000023_S0000116	HI I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO THE SHOW FOR A WHILE I'VE HEARD ABOUT A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT PHILOSOPHERS AND I'VE GOTTEN TO A PLACE WHERE I FEEL THE COMPLEXITY OF THINGS MAKES ME FEEL PRETTY UNCERTAIN ABOUT CHOOSING A WORLD VIEW
POD1000000023_S0000117	SOMETIMES I FEEL AGNOSTIC ABOUT ALMOST EVERY ISSUE OF SUBSTANCE I CAN THINK OF BUT THIS CREATES A PROBLEM FOR ME BECAUSE I STILL NEED TO OPERATE IN DAY TO DAY LIFE
POD1000000023_S0000118	HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO LIVE A LIFE WHERE YOU'RE RADICALLY UNCERTAIN ABOUT THINGS BUT STILL CAPABLE OF FUNCTIONING ON AN EVERYDAY LEVEL
POD1000000023_S0000119	THERE ARE MANY ANSWERS TO THIS QUESTION BUT RICHARD RORTY OFFERS ONE OF THEM THROUGH DISCUSSION OF LIVING A LIFE AS AN IRONIST
POD1000000023_S0000120	NOW BY IRONIST HE DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE SMELTING METAL DOWN AT THE HOME DEPOT EVERY DAY THE TERM IRONIST IS A REFERENCE TO IRONY
POD1000000023_S0000121	TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE LIFE OF AN IRONIST THOUGH WE FIRST NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE MUCH MORE COMMON ALMOST UBIQUITOUS WAY THAT PEOPLE APPROACH FIGURING THINGS OUT ABOUT THE WORLD
POD1000000023_S0000122	A WAY OF THINKING DEEPLY EMBEDDED IN THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY
POD1000000023_S0000123	MOST PEOPLE VIEW THEIR INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT AS A PERSON AS A LINEAR PROGRESSION OF MOVING PAST APPEARANCES AND GETTING TO THE REALITY OF THE WORLD
POD1000000023_S0000124	THIS GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO PLATO'S ALLEGORY THE CAVE SHADOWS ON A CAVE WALL WE DO THE WORK OF A PHILOSOPHER AND EVENTUALLY CAN DESCEND OUT OF THE CAVE AND SEE THE SUN OR TRUE KNOWLEDGE FOR WHAT IT ACTUALLY IS
POD1000000023_S0000125	WELL THIS WAY OF VIEWING OURSELVES HAS BEEN A FIXTURE IN OUR CULTURE FOR SO LONG THAT IT'S THE WAY MANY PEOPLE SEE THEIR PROCESS OF GROWTH WHEN LEARNING ABOUT THE WORLD
POD1000000023_S0000126	THERE'S THIS INTUITIVE SENSE THAT WE'RE BORN WE'RE YOUNG DUMB NAIVE WE GET INFORMATION FROM OUR TEACHERS PARENTS BASIC NEWS SOURCES AND THERE'S A SENSE IN WHICH WE'RE LIVING IN A WORLD OF APPEARANCES AT THIS POINT
POD1000000023_S0000127	SEE IT'S NOT UNTIL WE'VE DONE THE WORK OF READING FIVE NEWSPAPERS A DAY READING A THOUSAND BOOKS TRAVELING TO A HUNDRED DIFFERENT COUNTRIES NOT UNTIL WE'VE DONE THAT CAN WE SAY THAT WE'VE ARRIVED AT A WORLDVIEW THAT SEES REALITY ON REALITY TERMS
POD1000000023_S0000128	BUT JUST AS THERE'S NO SINGLE THEORY EMBEDDED INTO THE UNIVERSE ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS OR POLITICAL STRATEGY OR ANYTHING FOR THAT MATTER
POD1000000023_S0000129	THERE'S NO SINGLE CORRECT VIEW OF EXISTENCE THAT YOU'RE SOMEHOW ACCESSING THROUGH LIFE EXPERIENCES AND READING A BUNCH OF STUFF
POD1000000023_S0000130	YOU MAY THINK THAT YOU HAVE A RATIONAL JUSTIFICATION FOR EVERY VIEW THAT YOU HOLD YOU MAY THINK IT'S THE GREATEST WORLD VIEW THAT'S EVER BEEN CREATED
POD1000000023_S0000131	BUT IT WAS CREATED BY YOU BY A HUMAN BEING AND ROADY WOULD SAY THAT ALTHOUGH WE OFTEN DECEIVE OURSELVES INTO THINKING IT'S THE TRUTH
POD1000000023_S0000132	REALLY WHAT WE'VE CREATED HERE IS WHAT HE CALLS A FINAL VOCABULARY
POD1000000023_S0000133	MORE ON FINAL VOCABULARIES IN ONE SECOND BUT FIRST I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HEAR ROADY TALK ABOUT A KEY DISTINCTION BETWEEN SOMEONE SAYING THE WORLD IS OUT THERE AND SAYING THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE
POD1000000023_S0000134	AND HOW THESE STATEMENTS ULTIMATELY RELATE TO THE LANGUAGE WE USE HE SAYS QUOTE WE NEED TO MAKE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE CLAIM THAT THE WORLD IS OUT THERE AND THE CLAIM THAT THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE
POD1000000023_S0000135	TO SAY THAT THE WORLD IS OUT THERE THAT IT IS NOT OUR CREATION IS TO SAY WITH COMMON SENSE THAT MOST THINGS IN SPACE AND TIME ARE THE EFFECTS OF CAUSES WHICH DO NOT INCLUDE HUMAN MENTAL STATES
POD1000000023_S0000136	TO SAY THAT THE TRUTH IS NOT OUT THERE IS SIMPLY TO SAY THAT WHERE THERE ARE NO SENTENCES THERE IS NO TRUTH THAT SENTENCES ARE ELEMENTS OF HUMAN LANGUAGES
POD1000000023_S0000137	AND THAT HUMAN LANGUAGES ARE HUMAN CREATIONS TRUTH CANNOT BE OUT THERE IT CANNOT EXIST INDEPENDENTLY OF THE HUMAN MIND
POD1000000023_S0000138	BECAUSE SENTENCES CANNOT SO EXIST OR BE OUT THERE THE WORLD IS OUT THERE BUT DESCRIPTIONS OF THE WORLD ARE NOT
POD1000000023_S0000139	ONLY DESCRIPTIONS OF THE WORLD CAN BE TRUE OR FALSE THE WORLD ON ITS OWN UNAIDED BY THE DESCRIBING ACTIVITIES OF HUMAN BEINGS CANNOT END QUOTE
POD1000000023_S0000140	THIS IS ONE OF ROY'S MOST FAMOUS CONCEPTS WHAT MANY REFER TO AS THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN MAKING AND FINDING
POD1000000023_S0000141	LOCK AND KANT ARE NOT FINDING THE TRUTH ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS THEY'RE USING A VERY HUMAN PROCESS CALLED REASON TO MAKE A TRUTH ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS THAT WE THEN USE TO STRUCTURE OUR SOCIETIES
POD1000000023_S0000142	LIBERALISM WAS NOT FOUND TO BE THE BEST POLITICAL STRATEGY HISTORICAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND COMMON VALUES AMONG PEOPLE MADE IT THE BEST POLITICAL STRATEGY FOR A TIME
POD1000000023_S0000143	WHEN YOU READ A THOUSAND BOOKS YOU ARE NOT FINDING THE TRUTH ABOUT EXISTENCE YOU ARE MAKING A FINAL VOCABULARY THAT ALLOWS YOU TO INTERFACE WITH REALITY DURING THE SPECIFIC TIME THAT YOU HAPPEN TO BE LIVING
POD1000000023_S0000144	BY FINAL VOCABULARY RATE MEANS A COLLECTION OF STORIES METAPHORS NARRATIVES DISCOURSES TONS OF DIFFERENT TOOLS OF RHETORIC THAT YOU USE TO MAKE SENSE OF THE WORLD AND SEE YOUR PLACE IN IT
POD1000000023_S0000145	THIS IS CALLED A FINAL VOCABULARY BECAUSE THE THINGS THAT MAKE IT UP ARE OFTEN VERY FINAL THE FOUNDATIONS ARE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO DEVELOP ANY FURTHER BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT IF YOU ARE PRESSED HARD ENOUGH
POD1000000023_S0000146	TO EXPLAIN YOUR WORLDVIEW BY SOMEBODY SKILLED ENOUGH AT ARGUING WITH ENOUGH TIME ON THEIR HANDS READY SAYS THAT EVENTUALLY THERE WOULD BE NO WAY FOR YOU TO EXPLAIN WHY YOUR WORLDVIEW IS BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE'S IN A NON CIRCULAR WAY
POD1000000023_S0000147	IT IS A COURAGEOUS THING TO FIGHT AND DIE FOR YOUR COUNTRY BECAUSE LOOK FIGHTING AND DYING FOR YOUR COUNTRY IS LIKE ONE OF THE MOST COURAGEOUS THINGS YOU CAN DO THE BIBLE IS TRUE SO YOU SHOULD TRUST THE WORD OF GOD
POD1000000023_S0000148	WHEN PRESSED HARD ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY YOUR WORLDVIEW IN A CONVERSATION THESE ARE THE SORTS OF STORIES AND METAPHORS THAT GROUND THE VALUES OF SOMEONE THAT THINKS THEY'VE GOT IT ALL FIGURED OUT
POD1000000023_S0000149	WHEN THE MORE ACCURATE DESCRIPTION IS THAT THEY SET UP CAMP IN AN ECHO CHAMBER OF PEOPLE THAT DON'T CALL THEM ON THEIR MISTAKES
POD1000000023_S0000150	EITHER BECAUSE THEY ONLY TALK TO PEOPLE WHO MOSTLY AGREE WITH THEM ALREADY OR BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT DISAGREE WITH THEM THAT THEY ALLOW INTO THEIR CIRCLES LACK THE ABILITY TO PRESS THEM FURTHER MAYBE PEOPLE JUST WANT TO BE POLITE
POD1000000023_S0000151	MAYBE OTHER PEOPLE JUST DON'T CARE ENOUGH ABOUT CHANGING SOMEONE INTO A LITTLE VERSION OF THEM TO SPEND THEIR TIME DOING IT
POD1000000023_S0000152	READY PRESCRIBES AN ANTIDOTE TO THIS WAY OF THINKING ABOUT GETTING PAST APPEARANCES TO THE REALITY OF THE WORLD HERE'S A PRETTY FAMOUS PASSAGE FROM HIS WORK THAT DESCRIBES HIS THREE CRITERIA FOR LIVING LIFE AS AN IRONIST
POD1000000023_S0000153	HE SAYS QUOTE I SHALL DEFINE AN IRONIST AS SOMEONE WHO FULFILLS THREE CONDITIONS
POD1000000023_S0000154	ONE SHE HAS RADICAL AND CONTINUING DOUBTS ABOUT THE FINAL VOCABULARY SHE CURRENTLY USES BECAUSE SHE HAS BEEN IMPRESSED BY OTHER VOCABULARIES VOCABULARIES TAKEN AS FINAL BY PEOPLE OR BOOKS SHE HAS ENCOUNTERED
POD1000000023_S0000155	TWO SHE REALIZES THAT ARGUMENT PHRASED IN HER PRESENT VOCABULARY CAN NEITHER UNDERWRITE NOR DISSOLVE THESE DOUBTS
POD1000000023_S0000156	THREE INSOFAR AS SHE PHILOSOPHIZE ABOUT HER SITUATION SHE DOES NOT THINK THAT HER VOCABULARY IS CLOSER TO REALITY THAN OTHERS THAT IT IS IN TOUCH WITH A POWER NOT HERSELF
POD1000000023_S0000157	IRONIST WHO ARE INCLINED TO PHILOSOPHIZE SEE THE CHOICE BETWEEN VOCABULARIES AS MADE NEITHER WITHIN A NEUTRAL OR UNIVERSAL META VOCABULARY NOT BY AN ATTEMPT TO FIGHT ONE'S WAY PAST APPEARANCES TO THE REAL BUT SIMPLY BY PLAYING THE NEW OFF AGAINST THE OLD
POD1000000023_S0000158	END QUOTE SO IMAGINE LIVING LIFE AS AN IRONIST AS OPPOSED TO THIS OTHER TYPE OF PERSON WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT
POD1000000023_S0000159	YOU'D LIVE YOUR DAY TO DAY LIFE NOT LIKE FIRE FROM ANCIENT ATHENS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WALK IN FRONT OF CARS DOUBTING WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE ACTUALLY THERE YOU'D HAVE A SORT OF WORKING THEORY A FINAL VOCABULARY THAT YOU USE TO FUNCTION
POD1000000023_S0000160	THE DIFFERENCE WOULD BE THAT YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN OTHER FINAL VOCABULARIES SEEN THEIR WEAKNESSES
POD1000000023_S0000161	AND YOU'D REALIZE THAT YOURS IS PROBABLY EQUALLY AS FLAWED AS THEIRS IS IN SOME WAY BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE YOU HAVE SPECIAL ACCESS TO THE TRUTH
POD1000000023_S0000162	YOU DON'T HAVE A DEITY BACKING YOUR WORLD VIEW YOU DON'T HAVE SOME NEUTRAL POINT OUTSIDE OF CULTURE AND HISTORY THAT YOU'RE DOING YOUR THINKING FROM YOU ARE JUST AS FALLIBLE AS THEY ARE
POD1000000023_S0000163	AND YOUR CONCLUSIONS RELY ON HISTORY AND CULTURE JUST AS MUCH AS THEIRS DO YOU WOULD HAVE CONTINUING RADICAL DOUBT ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH REALITY
POD1000000023_S0000164	YOU ALSO REALIZE THAT ANY ATTEMPT BY YOU TO ARGUE THAT YOUR FINAL VOCABULARY IS SOMEHOW SUPERIOR TO OTHERS IS A POINTLESS EXERCISE AND IT'S ACTUALLY YOU ENGAGING IN THAT CIRCULAR REASONING WE WERE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE
POD1000000023_S0000165	BECAUSE THINK ABOUT IT YOU'RE ARGUING FOR A SET OF STORIES AND NARRATIVES AS BEING SUPERIOR BUT ALL THE WHILE YOU'RE USING THAT SET OF STORIES AND NARRATIVES AS THE PREMISE THAT YOU'RE STARTING YOUR ARGUMENTS FROM
POD1000000023_S0000166	THIS IS WHY READY THINKS THAT WHEN IT COMES TO OUR FINAL VOCABULARIES ARGUING IN THE TRADITIONAL SENSE IS NOT A VERY EFFECTIVE WAY OF MAKING ANY PROGRESS AT ALL
POD1000000023_S0000167	RUDY SAYS THAT AN IRONIST ALWAYS REALIZES THAT ANYTHING CAN BE MADE TO LOOK GOOD OR BAD BY BEING REDESCRIBED
POD1000000023_S0000168	BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S SOME SINGLE ARGUMENTATIVE STANDARD OUT THERE
POD1000000023_S0000169	WINNING AN ARGUMENT IN THE TIMES OF NAPOLEON IS JUST FAR DIFFERENT THAN WINNING AN ARGUMENT TODAY
POD1000000023_S0000170	BECAUSE THE VALUES OF THE PEOPLE JUDGING HAVE CHANGED THE HISTORICAL CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE CHANGED THE STORY ABOUT HOW THE WORLD FITS TOGETHER HAS CHANGED DIFFERENT ARGUMENTS ARE MORE EFFECTIVE IN DIFFERENT FINAL VOCABULARIES
POD1000000023_S0000171	SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO ARGUE WITH SOMEONE YOU ARE ALWAYS RELYING ON THE FACT THAT YOUR POINTS ARE GOING TO FIT WELL INTO THE FINAL VOCABULARY OF THE PERSON THAT YOU'RE ARGUING WITH WHICH IS FAR FROM A GUARANTEE
POD1000000023_S0000172	AND THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT IS THAT YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF CONSTANTLY ARGUING AGAINST A PARTICULAR COMMON FINAL VOCABULARY THAT HAPPENS TO DOMINATE THE CULTURE YOU WERE BORN INTO
POD1000000023_S0000173	BETTER TO INSTEAD LEAD BY EXAMPLE THROUGH IRONY WHEN SOMEONE THINKS THEY'VE LASSOED THE TRUTH WITH THEIR VOCABULARY THEY GOT IT
POD1000000023_S0000174	THE FAR MORE EFFECTIVE METHOD WILL ALWAYS BE TO DO WHAT RUDY CALLS IRONIC DISRUPTION WHICH DOESN'T MEAN YOU PULL OUT YOUR RICHARD RORTY HANDBOOK AND ARGUE THEM DOWN POINT BY POINT UNTIL THEY SEE THE WORLD THE WAY THAT YOU DO
POD1000000023_S0000175	THE GOAL IS THROUGH ONE METHOD OR ANOTHER USUALLY RHETORICAL DEVICES
POD1000000023_S0000176	YOU TRY TO ALLOW THIS PERSON TO SEE ON THEIR OWN THE PERSPECTIVE FROM OUTSIDE THEIR SINGLE WORLD VIEW THE HOPE BEING THAT ONCE THEY'RE IN THIS PLACE THEY'LL REALIZE HOW LIMITING THEIR BASIC WAY OF VIEWING THE WORLD IS
POD1000000023_S0000177	BECAUSE IT COMPLETELY CLOSES THEM OFF FROM NEW WAYS OF CONNECTING WITH PEOPLE IDEAS AND THE WORLD THAT IS OUT THERE ONCE AGAIN THE WORLD THAT IS OUT THERE NOT THE TRUTH THAT IS OUT THERE
POD1000000023_S0000178	TO BE IN THIS PLACE STEPPING OUTSIDE OF YOUR WORLDVIEW AND SEEING A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY THE WORLD COULD BE RATIONALLY JUSTIFIED CAN BE TRANSFORMATIVE
POD1000000023_S0000179	SHOULD BE SAID THIS PROCESS ALSO BENEFITS THE IRONIST BECAUSE THEY NEED AS MUCH EXPERIENCE WITH FINAL VOCABULARIES AS THEY CAN GET THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO SPOT THESE FROM A MILE AWAY
POD1000000023_S0000180	RODY SAYS IN A PASSAGE THAT AN IRONIST IS NEVER QUITE ABLE TO TAKE THEMSELVES SERIOUSLY
POD1000000023_S0000181	BECAUSE THEY LIVE THEIR LIFE ACKNOWLEDGING HOW MUCH OF THEIR FINAL VOCABULARY WASN'T EVEN A CHOICE THEY CONSCIOUSLY MADE
POD1000000023_S0000182	AND THAT AT ANY POINT SOME OF THE ISSUES THEY BELIEVE IN MOST STRONGLY TODAY MIGHT TOMORROW CHANGE IN A SINGLE CONVERSATION
POD1000000023_S0000183	THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT APPROACH TO YOUR INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT AND A VERY DIFFERENT WAY OF APPROACHING CONVERSATIONS WITH PEOPLE THAT DISAGREE WITH YOU POLITICALLY
POD1000000023_S0000184	THIS PERSON WOULD SEEM LIKE AN ALIEN IN THE CURRENT POLITICAL LANDSCAPE BUT THIS IS ULTIMATELY THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT EMERGES IN A PLURALISTIC LANDSCAPE OF IDEAS RATHER THAN ONE THAT BELIEVES IN A SINGLE CORRECT ANSWER TO EVERY POLITICAL QUESTION
POD1000000023_S0000185	SO YOU MAY WONDER WHY BOTHER WHY EVEN SPEND A SECOND OF MY LIFE TRYING TO TALK TO SOMEBODY SHOWING THEM HOW THEY'RE LIMITING THEMSELVES TO A SINGLE ANSWER
POD1000000023_S0000186	LET THEM DO WHATEVER IT IS THEY'RE GOING TO DO BUT RADY WOULD SAY THAT THESE PEOPLE THAT TRULY BELIEVE THEY ARE READING BOOKS AND GETTING PAST THE WORLD OF APPEARANCES TO THE TRUE REALITY OF THINGS
POD1000000023_S0000187	THIS OUTDATED OVERSIMPLIFIED ATTITUDE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SO MUCH OF THE CRUELTY THAT GOES ON IN THIS WORLD
POD1000000023_S0000188	LIBERAL SOCIETY IN HIS EYES HAS A CONSTANT OBLIGATION TO REMIND OURSELVES OF THE WAYS THAT THE CURRENT ORDER OF THINGS MIGHT BE HURTING PEOPLE AROUND US MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE WHEN YOU HAVE A PLURALISTIC OUTLOOK
POD1000000023_S0000190	YOU KNOW THERE ARE RELATIVISTS OUT THERE THAT WOULD MAKE AN ARGUMENT THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD STOP FIGHTING OVER THEIR PETTY DISAGREEMENTS BECAUSE ULTIMATELY EVERYTHING IS ARBITRARY
POD1000000023_S0000191	THERE ARE CAPITAL RATIONALISTS OUT THERE THAT'LL SAY EVERYONE SHOULD STOP FIGHTING BECAUSE WELL I'VE COME UP WITH THE RIGHT ANSWER I FOUND IT NO MORE WORK TO BE DONE
POD1000000023_S0000192	THE WAY RICHARD RORTY WALKS THIS LINE OF NATURE AND CULTURE IS PARTIALLY THROUGH HIS BEAUTIFUL USE OF PRAGMATISM RADY WOULDN'T SAY YOU SHOULD CARE LESS HE WOULDN'T SAY YOU SHOULD CARE MORE
POD1000000023_S0000193	WHAT HE WOULD SAY I THINK THOUGH IS THAT THE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT WE CARE ABOUT LIES IN SOLIDARITY AMONGST FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS
POD1000000023_S0000194	THAT SOLIDARITY IS WHAT KEEPS US IN LINE NOT A COSMIC LAW THAT SOLIDARITY IS WHAT DETERMINES OUR VALUES NOT SOME PHILOSOPHER UP IN A TOWER
POD1000000023_S0000195	TO UNDERSTAND THE HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL ENVIRONMENT THAT YOU LIVE IN IS ONLY THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS UNDERSTANDING THE SOLIDARITY THAT HOLDS SOCIETY TOGETHER
POD1000000023_S0000196	HE SAID IT WELL WHEN DESCRIBING ONE OF HIS BOOKS HERE AND ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS PASSAGES FROM ANY OF HIS WORK
POD1000000023_S0000197	HE SAYS QUOTE THE FUNDAMENTAL PREMISE OF THIS BOOK IS THAT A BELIEF CAN STILL REGULATE ACTION CAN STILL BE WORTH DYING FOR AMONG PEOPLE WHO ARE QUITE AWARE THAT THIS BELIEF IS CAUSED BY NOTHING MORE THAN CONTINGENT HISTORICAL CIRCUMSTANCES
POD1000000023_S0000198	END QUOTE
POD1000000023_S0000199	THANK YOU FOR LISTENING I'LL TALK TO YOU NEXT TIME
POD1000000024_S0000000	I DREADED DOING THE SHOW SOMETIMES BECAUSE WHATEVER IT WAS
POD1000000024_S0000001	FEELING
POD1000000024_S0000002	YEAH FEELINGS FEELINGS
POD1000000024_S0000003	I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAD SORT OF AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AT THAT POINT THAT THINGS WERE STRAINED BETWEEN US
POD1000000024_S0000004	WE WERE DEFINITELY NOT AS CLOSE AS WE HAD ONCE BEEN BY THE TIME THAT THAT WAS HAPPENING
POD1000000024_S0000005	AND PART OF THIS PERIOD OF TIME IS ABOUT THE WEIRD DUALITY BETWEEN BECOMING RECOGNIZED AS FRIENDS MORE PUBLICLY
POD1000000024_S0000006	EVEN AS WE WERE SPENDING LESS TIME IN THAT KIND OF INTIMATE COMMUNICATION THAT REALLY MAKES A FRIENDSHIP FEEL SAFE AND SECURE
POD1000000024_S0000007	I DON'T KNOW DOES THAT FEEL RIGHT TO YOU SORRY
POD1000000024_S0000008	SO RIGHT PLEASE BE MY SPOKESPERSON FOR EVERYTHING THANK YOU

POD1000000024_S0000014	ANN FRIEDMAN IS A JOURNALIST WHOSE WRITING HAS BEEN IN PLACES LIKE THE NEW YORK TIMES AND THE GUARDIAN
POD1000000024_S0000015	THEY'VE BEEN BEST FRIENDS SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINE BUT FOR MOST OF THAT TIME THEY'VE LIVED ON OPPOSITE COASTS
POD1000000024_S0000016	IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THEY STARTED CO HOSTING THE PODCAST CALL YOUR GIRLFRIEND WHOSE TAGLINE IS A PODCAST FOR LONG DISTANCE BESTIES EVERYWHERE
POD1000000024_S0000017	IT GETS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF LISTENERS
POD1000000024_S0000018	THEY RECORD IT FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE HOMES JUST LIKE THEY DID FOR THE INTERVIEW FOR THIS EPISODE
POD1000000024_S0000019	BUT MAINTAINING A FRIENDSHIP ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND ACROSS A PROFESSIONAL COLLABORATION HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN EASY
POD1000000024_S0000020	THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM TURNED INTO EMOTIONAL DISTANCE AND THEY HAD TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO RECONNECT
POD1000000024_S0000021	THEY'VE CO WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT IT CALLED BIG FRIENDSHIP WHICH COMES OUT IN JULY
POD1000000024_S0000022	BUT THAT PROJECT IS JUST THE NEXT CHAPTER IN THEIR STORY WHICH STARTED OVER A DECADE AGO
POD1000000024_S0000023	HERE'S AMINATOU
POD1000000024_S0000025	ANNE AND I MET AT A GOSSIP GIRL VIEWING PARTY IN WASHINGTON D C IN TWO THOUSAND NINE
POD1000000024_S0000026	GOSSIP GIRL WAS IMPORTANT THEN IT IS STILL IMPORTANT TODAY
POD1000000024_S0000028	THAT PARTY WAS HOSTED BY OUR MUTUAL FRIEND DO
POD1000000024_S0000029	SHE SPECIFICALLY INVITED BOTH OF US TO THAT PARTY HAVING ALREADY IDENTIFIED THAT WE WOULD PROBABLY GET ALONG AND BE FRIENDS
POD1000000024_S0000030	IN THE SAME WAY THAT SOMEONE WOULD LIKE SET YOU UP ON A BLIND DATE ROMANTICALLY
POD1000000024_S0000031	THIS WAS LIKE A FRIENDSHIP LIKE SETUP
POD1000000024_S0000032	I DO REMEMBER JUST FEELING LIKE EVERY COMMENT AND EVERY JOKE AND EVERY LITTLE LIKE ASIDE OR CONTRIBUTION SHE MADE TO THE KIND OF META CONVERSATION HAPPENING ABOUT THE TV SHOW WAS JUST SPOT ON
POD1000000024_S0000033	AND JUST BEING LIKE I COULD BE HERE FOREVER AND LISTEN TO EVERY SINGLE WORD THAT COMES OUT OF THIS WOMAN'S MOUTH
POD1000000024_S0000034	I JUST REALLY LIKED YOUR OUTFIT ANNE
POD1000000024_S0000035	WOW
POD1000000024_S0000036	WAS LIKE YES FINALLY A GOOD OUTFIT IN THIS TOWN
POD1000000024_S0000037	LIKE I REMEMBER THAT BEING REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME
POD1000000024_S0000038	BUT I JUST REMEMBER REALLY APPRECIATING THAT THIS PERSON WAS BOTH LIKE HILARIOUS AND ALSO SMART
POD1000000024_S0000039	AND THEN MUCH LATER WHEN I CONNECTED THE DOTS TO THE FACT THAT OH YOU WERE THE ANN FRIEDMAN WHOSE BYLINE I HAD READ BEFORE I WAS LIKE GREAT
POD1000000024_S0000040	EVERYTHING MAKES SENSE NOW OF COURSE
POD1000000024_S0000041	THIS WOMAN WHO WEARS THIS JEANS AND T SHIRTS SITUATION SO PERFECTLY ALSO HAS LIKE TEN OUT OF TEN TASTE IN TEN TELEVISION
POD1000000024_S0000042	SO YOU KNOW IT WORKED OUT REALLY WELL FOR ME
POD1000000024_S0000043	IT JUST WAS EASY RIGHT AWAY
POD1000000024_S0000044	AND SO THINGS ESCALATED LIKE VERY FAST
POD1000000024_S0000045	WE REALLY WANT ZERO TO A HUNDRED IN LIKE THE FIRST COUPLE MONTHS
POD1000000024_S0000046	WHEN I PICTURE THIS TIME IN OUR LIVES I JUST PICTURE US SPENDING DOZENS OF HOURS ON ONE OF OUR COUCHES
POD1000000024_S0000047	WE JUST SPEND SO MANY HOURS DOING NOTHING
POD1000000024_S0000048	IN THAT WAY IT FELT VERY MUCH LIKE A COLLEGE OR A TEAM FRIENDSHIP TO ME
POD1000000024_S0000049	OUR TWENTY S WERE VERY MUCH MARKED BY A LOT OF LIKE BIG GROUP HAS YOU KNOW
POD1000000024_S0000050	BUT I THINK THAT FOR ME THAT WHEN I KNEW THAT WE WERE GOING TO BE FRIENDS FOR A LONG TIME IS WHEN IT WAS OK TO BE LIKE ACTUALLY I DON'T WANT TO BE DOING
POD1000000024_S0000051	I JUST WANT TO BE TAKING OUR BRAS OFF ON THE COUCH AND JUST TALKING ABOUT MUNDANE STUFF OR LIKE READING SIDE BY SIDE LIKE NOT REALLY SAYING ANYTHING TO EACH OTHER
POD1000000024_S0000052	I HAD BEEN LIVING WITH A BOYFRIEND AND WE BROKE UP WHEN YOU AND I HAD BEEN FRIENDS FOR SIX MONTHS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
POD1000000024_S0000053	AND THEN WHEN I WENT TO REVISE MY PAPERWORK AT WORK LIKE WHO IS YOUR NEXT OF KIN OR WHATEVER THEY MAKE YOU PUT DOWN FOR WORK EMERGENCIES
POD1000000024_S0000054	AT THAT POINT IT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT IT WAS YOU
POD1000000024_S0000055	YEAH BY THAT POINT YOU WERE SOMEONE IN MY LIFE WHO I WAS LIKE YES LIKE GIVE HER MY FOUR ONE K
POD1000000024_S0000056	LIKE PLEASE CALL HER IF I SLIP ON A BANANA AT WORK
POD1000000024_S0000058	THIS IS THE ONLY CAPABLE PERSON IN MY LIFE THANK YOU
POD1000000024_S0000059	YOUR JOB AT THE BANANA FACTORY
POD1000000024_S0000061	THE PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW
POD1000000024_S0000063	IF I'M FOUND IN A DITCH SOMEWHERE I HOPE THAT MY PHONE LITERALLY SAYS PLEASE CALL ANN FRIEDMAN
POD1000000024_S0000065	BUT WE HAVE NOW BEEN FRIENDS WHO LIVE APART FOR MUCH LONGER THAN WE WERE FRIENDS WHO LIVED IN THE SAME CITY
POD1000000024_S0000066	I KNEW THAT EVENTUALLY YOU WOULD MOVE BECAUSE WE LIVED IN A VERY TRANSITIONAL KIND OF CITY
POD1000000024_S0000067	AND WE HAD TALKED ABOUT IT AND IT WAS LIKE THE GREAT RECESSION LIKE PEOPLE MOVE TO GO TO JOBS LIKE ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY
POD1000000024_S0000068	IT WAS NOT LIKE IT WAS A SURPRISE THAT ONE OF US WOULD HAVE TO MOVE
POD1000000024_S0000069	IT JUST FELT TOO SOON
POD1000000024_S0000070	YEAH AND IT'S FUNNY WHEN I THINK ABOUT MAKING THAT DECISION IT WAS SO WRAPPED UP IN WORK FOR ME
POD1000000024_S0000071	LIKE EVEN THOUGH OBVIOUSLY I WAS PHYSICALLY LEAVING LIKE OUR ABILITY TO SPEND ALL THESE HOURS ON THE COUCH TOGETHER
POD1000000024_S0000072	I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE OUR FRIENDSHIP WAS GOING TO END OR EVEN BE EXISTENTIALLY THREATENED BY THE FACT THAT I WAS MOVING AWAY
POD1000000024_S0000073	AND THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT I WASN'T SAD ABOUT IT OR THAT IT WAS EASY
POD1000000024_S0000074	IT'S JUST AT THE TIME IT REALLY JUST FELT LIKE OKAY LIKE WE'RE GOING TO BE AS CLOSE AS WE EVER WERE
POD1000000024_S0000075	IT'S JUST GOING TO LOOK A LITTLE DIFFERENT
POD1000000024_S0000076	I WAS DEVASTATED WHEN YOU MOVED AWAY ANNE AND I REMEMBER VERY CONSCIOUSLY HAVING TO MAKE A CHOICE OF LIKE I WILL NEVER SHOW THIS PERSON THAT I AM BUMMED OUT BY THIS
POD1000000024_S0000077	BECAUSE I KNEW JUST HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS FOR YOU AND I WAS ALSO REALLY EXCITED FOR YOU THAT YOU WERE ACTUALLY ON A PATH TO DO SOMETHING THAT YOU WANTED TO DO
POD1000000024_S0000078	I DON'T SHINE IF YOU DON'T SHINE IS SOMETHING THAT EMINA FIRST SAID TO ME AND THEN WE WOULD SAY TO EACH OTHER
POD1000000024_S0000079	MOSTLY I THINK AS AN ASSURANCE WHEN ONE OF US WAS WORRIED SHE WAS TAKING UP TOO MUCH SPACE IN THE OTHER'S BRAIN OR LIFE OR WHATEVER
POD1000000024_S0000080	MAYBE ASKING FOR TOO MUCH SUPPORT OR HELP A WAY OF REASSURING EACH OTHER THAT WE WERE INVESTED IN EACH OTHER
POD1000000024_S0000081	AND I DON'T SHINE IF YOU DON'T SHINE WAS THE ASSURANCE THAT UNDERPINNED A LOT OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS
POD1000000024_S0000082	I HAVE ALWAYS FELT THAT COLLABORATION IS BETTER THAN COMPETITION
POD1000000024_S0000083	EVERY SUCCESS IN MY LIFE IS A TESTAMENT TO THAT
POD1000000024_S0000084	AND SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE WE STARTED CALLING IT SHINE THEORY PRIVATELY
POD1000000024_S0000085	AND THEN IN TWENTY THIRTEEN I WAS A COLUMNIST FOR THE CUT AND WROTE ABOUT IT IN A COLUMN
POD1000000024_S0000086	AND LOTS OF PEOPLE READ AND SHARED THE COLUMN AND THEN IT BECAME A LOT BIGGER THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED
POD1000000024_S0000087	BUT LIKE ALL THINGS THAT GO VIRAL THERE ARE ALSO A LOT OF COMPLICATIONS WHERE YOU'RE LIKE GREAT IS EVERYONE REALLY ON THE SAME PAGE ABOUT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
POD1000000024_S0000088	I REMEMBER MUCH TO MY SURPRISE AND HORROR SHINE THEORY DOT COM HAD ALREADY BEEN BOUGHT
POD1000000024_S0000089	A WOMAN WHO RAN A FITNESS STUDIO WAS USING IT TO PUSH SOME SORT OF LIKE MISS FITNESS STUDIO CONTEST
POD1000000024_S0000090	MY NAME WAS ON THE WEBSITE
POD1000000024_S0000091	AND SO A LAWYER WAS HIRED
POD1000000024_S0000092	AND I THINK THAT HAVING TO GO THROUGH THIS EXPERIENCE WITH YOU AND LIKE I MAKE DECISIONS DIFFERENTLY WHEN I'M MAKING DECISIONS WITH SOMEONE THAT I DO IF I'M MAKING THEM FOR MYSELF
POD1000000024_S0000093	YOU REALLY LEARN THAT LIKE PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT APPETITES FOR NEGOTIATION
POD1000000024_S0000094	LIKE PEOPLE HAVE YOU KNOW LIKE A DIFFERENT STYLE THAT THEY WANT TO BE COMBATIVE OR NOT COMBATIVE IN AND WHATEVER
POD1000000024_S0000095	I THINK THAT HAVING TO SORT OUT A LOT OF THOSE TANKS THROUGH THIS PROCESS ILLUMINATED A LOT OF THINGS
POD1000000024_S0000096	AND YOU KNOW LIKE ONE OF THEM BEING LIKE OKAY THIS REALLY SUCKS BUT I REALLY LIKE THE PERSON I HAVE TO DO THIS WITH
POD1000000024_S0000097	IT WAS IMPORTANT TO ME THAT WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE A DECISION THIS BIG TOGETHER
POD1000000024_S0000098	YOU KNOW WHEN IT WAS LIKE THAT WAS NOT FALLING APART
POD1000000024_S0000099	THE POINT AT WHICH WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE SHINE THEORY TRADEMARK WAS ACTUALLY SEVERAL MONTHS OR MAYBE EVEN DRAGGED OUT FOR LIKE MORE THAN A YEAR
POD1000000024_S0000100	THAT PERIOD OF TIME I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAD SORT OF AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AT THAT POINT THAT THINGS WERE STRAINED BETWEEN US
POD1000000024_S0000101	WE WERE DEFINITELY NOT AS CLOSE AS WE HAD ONCE BEEN BY THE TIME THAT THAT WAS HAPPENING
POD1000000024_S0000102	I THINK THAT WE'RE ENTERING INTO A PERIOD WHERE A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE WERE COMPARTMENTALIZING WERE STARTING TO BECOME PROBLEMS YOU KNOW
POD1000000024_S0000103	LIKE WE WERE BOTH CHANGING AND GOING THROUGH REALLY HARD THINGS IN OUR OWN LIVES VERY FAR APART PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY IN MOST CASES
POD1000000024_S0000104	AND I THINK FOR ME ALSO LIKE THIS HAS BEEN THE CENTRAL THE LESSON THAT I'M LEARNING AS AS I GROW UP EVERY DAY
POD1000000024_S0000105	PEOPLE ARE CHANGING CONSTANTLY
POD1000000024_S0000106	AND IT IS REALLY HARD TO DO A CHECK IN EVERY DAY AND REALIZE THAT YOU ARE DIFFERENT THAN YOU WERE YESTERDAY
POD1000000024_S0000107	AND SO I THINK THAT EVEN IF WE WERE LIKE LIVING IN THE SAME CITY OR WE YOU KNOW LIKE BOUGHT A HOUSE TOGETHER AND WE WERE ROOMMATES OR WHATEVER I STILL THINK THAT WE WOULD WE WOULD BE TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE
POD1000000024_S0000108	CLINGING ON TO AN IDEA OF WHO I THINK SOMEONE IS IS VERY REASSURING
POD1000000024_S0000109	BUT IN THAT LIKE YOU DON'T GIVE PEOPLE ROOM TO CHANGE THEIR MINDS OR TO EXPLORE NEW THINGS OR TO DO NEW THINGS AND SO
POD1000000024_S0000110	WE WERE DIFFERENT AND WE DIDN'T ACKNOWLEDGE IT AT THE BEGINNING AND THEN WE WERE CHANGING AND DIDN'T REALIZE THAT WE WERE CHANGING
POD1000000024_S0000111	AND THERE WAS SO MUCH TO ACCOUNT FOR IN THAT GAP
POD1000000024_S0000112	AND SO FOR EACH OF US DECIDING TO SHARE LESS OF OURSELVES WAS SOMETIMES A CONSCIOUS AND SOMETIMES A TOTALLY UNCONSCIOUS REFLEXIVE DECISION
POD1000000024_S0000113	YEAH WE HAD ALL OF THIS COMMUNICATION RELATED TO HOSTING A PODCAST TOGETHER
POD1000000024_S0000114	FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS THE ONLY PODCAST THAT I LISTEN TO WAS THIS AMERICAN LIFE
POD1000000024_S0000115	SO IT NEVER EVEN OCCURRED TO ME THAT IT WAS SOMETHING WE COULD DO
POD1000000024_S0000116	BUT I HAD MET GINA DELVAC OUR PRODUCER THROUGH ANNE AND SOME OF ANNE'S FRIENDS IN LA AND AT SOME POINT SOMEWHERE IN PALM SPRINGS
POD1000000024_S0000117	LIKE BETWEEN PROBABLY DRUGS AND WINE FOR ME IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT WE COULD DO A PODCAST
POD1000000024_S0000118	I THINK SHE WAS JUST LIKE YOU GUYS HAVE GOOD CHEMISTRY AND YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT DOING THIS
POD1000000024_S0000119	AND I'M ALSO PRETTY SURE WE SAID THAT STANDARD THING THAT I HEAR MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE WOMEN SAY WHEN YOU SUGGEST THEY RECORD THEMSELVES WHICH IS I HATE MY VOICE WHY WOULD I DO THAT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
POD1000000024_S0000120	YOU KNOW I'M PRETTY SURE WE WERE KIND OF DISMISSIVE BUT THEN ALSO THAT WE THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND TALKED ABOUT IT AND
POD1000000024_S0000121	SEVERAL WEEKS LATER
POD1000000024_S0000122	DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE IN THE CAR AND YOU BOUGHT THE URL ON YOUR PHONE
POD1000000024_S0000123	YES WE CAME UP WITH THE NAME IN THE CAR
POD1000000024_S0000124	I CONFESS THAT IF I HAD REALLY SAT THERE AND THOUGHT FOR LONGER THAN THIRTY SECONDS THE SHOW PROBABLY WOULD NOT BE CALLED CALL YOUR GIRLFRIEND
POD1000000024_S0000125	IT WOULD BE CALLED SOMETHING ELSE
POD1000000024_S0000126	INDEED
POD1000000024_S0000127	THIS IS HOW WE WORK
POD1000000024_S0000128	NOTHING IS REAL UNLESS THERE IS A WEBSITE
POD1000000024_S0000129	NOTHING IS REAL UNLESS YOU'VE HAD A MEETING ABOUT IT
POD1000000024_S0000130	AND GINA HAD DONE ALL OF THE WORK TO SAY THIS IS WHAT WE THINK IT COULD BE
POD1000000024_S0000131	AND BECAUSE SHE DID THAT IT MADE ME FEEL LIKE WE COULD ACTUALLY DO IT
POD1000000024_S0000132	WE DIDN'T THINK THAT TONS OF STRANGERS WOULD LISTEN TO IT
POD1000000024_S0000133	I THINK THAT LIKE A HUGE PART OF THE SHOW'S SUCCESS HONESTLY IS THAT WE BACKED INTO ALL OF THESE THINGS
POD1000000024_S0000134	IF THEY HAD COME TO ME AND SAID HEY DO YOU WANT TO RUN A SMALL MEDIA COMPANY WHERE WE HAVE TO GET A GOVERNMENT IN AND WE HAVE TO DO PAYROLL
POD1000000024_S0000135	I WOULD HAVE SAID ABSOLUTELY NOT PLEASE NEVER SPEAK TO ME AGAIN THIS IS NOT WHAT I WANT TO DO
POD1000000024_S0000136	AND IT SOUNDS LIKE A REALLY DUMB THING TO SAY NOW BUT IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME THAT PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT OUR FRIENDS WOULD LISTEN TO IT
POD1000000024_S0000137	HI WELCOME TO CALL YOUR GIRLFRIEND
POD1000000024_S0000138	A PODCAST FOR LONG DISTANCE BESSIE'S EVERYWHERE
POD1000000024_S0000139	USUALLY WE ARE LONG DISTANCE BESTIES BUT TODAY WE ARE IN THE SAME ROOM
POD1000000024_S0000140	I KNOW WE'RE CHEATING AND I LOVE IT
POD1000000024_S0000141	BUT I DREADED DOING THE SHOW SOMETIMES BECAUSE WHATEVER IT WAS
POD1000000024_S0000142	FEELING
POD1000000024_S0000143	FEELING
POD1000000024_S0000144	WHEN WE ARE NOT COMMUNICATING WELL AND YOU ADD DISTANCE TO IT LIKE THAT WAS AN ISSUE
POD1000000024_S0000145	ALWAYS THINKING LIKE OKAY WE'LL DEAL WITH THIS LATER
POD1000000024_S0000146	THERE WAS ALWAYS LIKE A THING YOU KNOW LIKE A SMALL THING THAT YOU WOULD DEAL WITH LATER AND THEN THAT JAR GOT FULL AND YOU'RE LIKE OH THIS IS A LOT OF STUFF
POD1000000024_S0000147	AND IT HAPPENED IN SO MANY LITTLE WAYS THAT WE DIDN'T REALLY EVEN FULLY ACKNOWLEDGE IT UNTIL THINGS HAD GOTTEN REALLY BAD
POD1000000024_S0000148	AND I THINK PART OF THIS PERIOD OF TIME IS ABOUT THE WEIRD DUALITY BETWEEN BECOMING RECOGNIZED AS FRIENDS MORE PUBLICLY
POD1000000024_S0000149	EVEN AS WE WERE SPENDING LESS TIME IN THAT KIND OF INTIMATE COMMUNICATION THAT REALLY MAKES A FRIENDSHIP FEEL SAFE AND SECURE
POD1000000024_S0000150	I DON'T KNOW DOES THAT FEEL RIGHT TO YOU SORRY
POD1000000024_S0000152	SO RIGHT PLEASE BE MY SPOKESPERSON FOR EVERYTHING THANK YOU
POD1000000024_S0000154	THERE WAS SORT OF THIS ILLUSION THAT WE WERE STILL IN TOUCH IN THE SAME WAY WE HAD ALWAYS BEEN
POD1000000024_S0000155	EVEN THOUGH WE WEREN'T ACTUALLY TALKING IN LIKE TRULY INTIMATE WAYS ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN EACH OF OUR LIVES
POD1000000024_S0000156	WE WERE KIND OF TALKING ABOUT LOGISTICAL THINGS FOR WORK OR WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE NEWS OR POP CULTURE ON THE PODCAST
POD1000000024_S0000157	YOU KNOW THE KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS THAT REALLY UNDERPINNED OUR RELATIONSHIP IN THE BEGINNING JUST WEREN'T HAPPENING ANYMORE WITH THE SAME FREQUENCY
POD1000000024_S0000158	I KNEW THAT WE WEREN'T DOING WELL BUT I KNEW THAT YOU DIDN'T HATE ME
POD1000000024_S0000159	THE THING THAT WAS HARD ABOUT OUR CONFLICT IS THAT WE LOVED EACH OTHER BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER
POD1000000024_S0000160	I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT THE WORDS WERE THAT YOU SAID IN THAT CONVERSATION BUT I JUST REMEMBER THE RELIEF I FELT WHEN YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU DIDN'T FEEL GOOD
POD1000000024_S0000161	I FEEL AWFUL I THINK IS WHAT
POD1000000024_S0000163	
POD1000000024_S0000166	SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SCARY MOMENT
POD1000000024_S0000167	SHOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE OH NO AND INSTEAD I WAS LIKE THANK GOD FINALLY LIKE IT'S ALL ON THE TABLE
POD1000000024_S0000168	AND I REMEMBER JUST FEELING THIS HUGE SENSE OF RELIEF OF GREAT WE ARE HAVING A BREAKDOWN AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT I LOVE IT
POD1000000024_S0000169	AND SO THAT'S HOW WE ENDED UP COUPLES THERAPY
POD1000000024_S0000170	DOESN'T IT FEEL GOOD TO LAUGH ABOUT THIS NOW
POD1000000024_S0000171	LIKE EXPENSIVE EVERY LAUGH IS THE SOUND OF THOUSANDS OF THERAPY DOLLARS
POD1000000024_S0000173	WE WOULD LIKE I DON'T KNOW RECORD THE PODCAST AND THEN YOU KNOW LIKE HANG UP THAT EQUIPMENT AND BE LIKE WELL ARE YOU READY TO GO TO DR SOENS LATER
POD1000000024_S0000174	SHOW UP TO THERAPY DO THAT REALLY HARD WORK AND ALSO SOMETIMES LIKE AGREE OR DISAGREE WITH THE THERAPIST AND BE ABLE TO TALK TO EACH OTHER ABOUT IT
POD1000000024_S0000175	THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THAT THAT FELT LIKE SUCH AN OUT OF BODY EXPERIENCE TO ME WHERE I WAS LIKE AM I REALLY THIS GROWN UP
POD1000000024_S0000176	LIKE I WORKED WITH THIS PERSON WE ARE NOW AT OUR THERAPISTS AND NOW WE'RE GONNA GO HOME AND LAY ON THE FLOOR BECAUSE THIS WAS SO HARD
POD1000000024_S0000177	IF YOU HAD NOT BEEN AT THOSE THERAPY SESSIONS WITH ME I WOULD NOT BELIEVE THAT IT HAD HAPPENED
POD1000000024_S0000178	BUT IT DID HAPPEN AND SOMEHOW WE DID IT
POD1000000024_S0000179	RIGHT WE BOTH STILL WANTED TO BE THERE
POD1000000024_S0000180	LIKE I THINK ABOUT THAT SAYING ABOUT LIKE HOW DO YOU STAY MARRIED YOU JUST DON'T GET DIVORCED OR WHATEVER I DON'T KNOW
POD1000000024_S0000181	BUT I WILL SAY THAT LIKE WE WERE BOTH CONTINUING TO SHOW UP
POD1000000024_S0000182	IN OUR FRIENDSHIP I'VE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT BEING SOMEONE WHO WHO DOESN'T RUN AWAY FROM THEIR COMMITMENTS
POD1000000024_S0000183	WE FELT LIKE THIS EXPERIENCE WE HAD HAD TRYING TO REPAIR AN INTIMATE FRIENDSHIP THAT HAD LIKE HIT THE ROCKS IS NOT SOMETHING WE SAW REFLECTED ANYWHERE
POD1000000024_S0000184	SO THERE WAS A MOTIVATION I THINK TO TRY TO PUT SOME OF THIS DOWN IN WORDS
POD1000000024_S0000185	I THINK WE STARTED TO TALK ABOUT WRITING A BOOK PROPOSAL IN MAYBE TWENTY SEVENTEEN DOES THAT SOUND RIGHT
POD1000000024_S0000186	YEAH WHEN IT CAME TO AUDIO NEITHER OF US KNEW WHAT WE WERE DOING AND IT WAS VERY MUCH LIKE OKAY GREAT LIKE WE'RE STARTING FROM SCRATCH
POD1000000024_S0000187	AND WITH THIS YOU KNOW ANNE IS A WRITER
POD1000000024_S0000188	AND I'M HER FRIEND BUT I'M ALSO HER FAN
POD1000000024_S0000189	LIKE I'VE READ ANNE FOR YEARS
POD1000000024_S0000190	AND SO I WAS REALLY THINKING ABOUT LIKE HOW IS THIS COLLABORATION GOING TO WORK
POD1000000024_S0000191	WE SOLD THIS BOOK IS LIKE WE ARE TWO COEQUAL AUTHORS AND I WAS LIKE GREAT
POD1000000024_S0000192	I'M LIKE PAIRED UP WITH AN OLYMPIAN AND NOW WE HAVE TO DO HURDLES
POD1000000024_S0000194	YOU KNOW A LOT OF BOOKS THAT ARE CO WRITTEN
POD1000000024_S0000195	YOU KNOW IN THIS FIFTY FIFTY WAY HAVE YOU KNOW CHAPTER ONE BY ONE PERSON AND THEN CHAPTER TWO IS BY THE OTHER PERSON AND THEY KIND OF VOLLEY BACK AND FORTH
POD1000000024_S0000196	AND WE MADE A CHOICE PRETTY EARLY ON THAT WE WANTED TO HAVE ONE NARRATIVE
POD1000000024_S0000197	AND SO AS A PROJECT IT IS REALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DISENTANGLE OUR VARIOUS INPUTS
POD1000000024_S0000198	AND I DON'T KNOW I FEEL LIKE THAT FEELS TRUE TO ME IN THE SENSE OF LIKE THAT'S REALLY WHAT A FRIENDSHIP FEELS LIKE
POD1000000024_S0000199	AND THE WAY WE DID THAT IS WE OUTLINED TOGETHER QUITE METICULOUSLY AND THEN WE WOULD TAKE A SECTION OF THE OUTLINE SPLIT UP
POD1000000024_S0000200	WE'D EACH WRITE NARRATIVELY THAT SECTION OF THE OUTLINE ON OUR SEPARATE COMPUTERS AND THEN WE WOULD EACH READ ALOUD WHAT WE HAD WRITTEN TO THE OTHER
POD1000000024_S0000201	AND THEN WE WOULD KNIT THEM TOGETHER AND KEEP THE BEST PARTS OF BOTH AND THEN MOVE ON TO THE NEXT SECTION OF THE OUTLINE FOR SEVENTY THOUSAND WORDS
POD1000000024_S0000202	WOW

POD1000000026_S0000004	WOULD YOU HAVE BEEN LIKE THAT WAS A YES
POD1000000026_S0000005	I MEAN
POD1000000026_S0000006	ASKED FOR CLARIFICATION
POD1000000026_S0000008	MIKE KRIEGER WAS CO FOUNDER AND FORMER CEO OF INSTAGRAM
POD1000000026_S0000009	I'M KEVIN SYSTROM FORMER CEO AND CO FOUNDER OF INSTAGRAM
POD1000000026_S0000011	KEVIN SYSTROM AND MIKE KRIEGER COFOUNDED INSTAGRAM IN TWO THOUSAND TEN
POD1000000026_S0000012	A YEAR AND A HALF LATER THEY SOLD IT TO FACEBOOK FOR A BILLION DOLLARS
POD1000000026_S0000013	THEY STAYED ON TO RUN THE COMPANY FOR ANOTHER SIX YEARS
POD1000000026_S0000014	AND THEN IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THEY LEFT TOGETHER
POD1000000026_S0000015	AND EVEN NOW THEY STILL WORK TOGETHER
POD1000000026_S0000016	THE FIRST TIME THEY MET THOUGH THEY HAD NO IDEA THAT IT WOULD LEAD TO SOMETHING SO MEANINGFUL
POD1000000026_S0000017	IN FACT KEVIN DOESN'T EVEN REMEMBER THAT FIRST TIME THEY MET
POD1000000026_S0000019	I'D LIKE TO SAY I DO I REALLY DON'T
POD1000000026_S0000020	THE FIRST TIME I REMEMBER MEETING MIKE WAS IN COFFEE BAR THE SMALL CAFE IN SAN FRANCISCO
POD1000000026_S0000021	IT BECAME MY GO TO OFFICE BECAUSE I HAD LEFT MY JOB AND I WAS WORKING ON THIS APP CALLED URBAN
POD1000000026_S0000022	AND IT WAS JUST ME
POD1000000026_S0000023	I KNEW OF MIKE I HAD SEEN HIM LIKE WE'RE IN THE SAME CIRCLES
POD1000000026_S0000024	AND I RECOGNIZED MIKE AND I WALKED OVER TO SAY HELLO
POD1000000026_S0000025	BUT THE FIRST THING I NOTICED WAS THE THING HE WAS WORKING
POD1000000026_S0000026	LIKE THIS BEAUTIFUL WEBSITE
POD1000000026_S0000027	AND I DIDN'T REALIZE HE WAS WORKING WITH DESIGN
POD1000000026_S0000028	SO ANYWAY IN MY MIND MIKE WAS LIKE THIS AMAZING DESIGNER
POD1000000026_S0000029	LITTLE DID I KNOW THAT ACTUALLY HE WAS AN AMAZING ENGINEER
POD1000000026_S0000031	DON'T KNOW THAT YOU'VE EVER TOUCHED PHOTOSHOP ACTUALLY
POD1000000026_S0000033	THAT'S NOT TRUE
POD1000000026_S0000034	I BUILT THE SHUTTER ON THE VERY FIRST VERSION OF INSTAGRAM AND IT WAS VERY BASIC
POD1000000026_S0000035	WASN'T THE SHUTTER LITERALLY JUST TWO GRAY SLIDERS THAT JUST CLOSED AND OPEN
POD1000000026_S0000036	
POD1000000026_S0000038	WAS NOT THAT WAS NOT THAT GOOD HONESTLY
POD1000000026_S0000040	BUT THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I REMEMBER HANGING OUT WITH YOU BECAUSE I REMEMBER BEING SO IMPRESSED
POD1000000026_S0000041	AND I ASKED YOU WHAT TOOL YOU WERE USING
POD1000000026_S0000042	AND I DON'T REMEMBER THE TOOL BUT I REMEMBER USING IT AND JUST BEING LIKE OH MAN LIKE
POD1000000026_S0000043	IT'S SO GOOD TO HAVE LIKE A MIC IN YOUR LIFE WHERE YOU CAN ASK THEM A QUESTION THEY JUST ALWAYS HAVE THE BEST ANSWER
POD1000000026_S0000044	TURNS OUT YEARS LATER I STILL FEEL LIKE THAT'S TRUE
POD1000000026_S0000045	I REMEMBER THINKING OH HERE'S SOMEBODY WHO'S ACTUALLY LIKE PURSUING SOMETHING THAT HE'S EXCITED ABOUT
POD1000000026_S0000046	ACTUALLY BUILDING IT AND LIKE OH A KINDRED SPIRIT THAT'S HERE ON THE WEEKENDS NOT JUST TO CHECK FACEBOOK OR DO SOMETHING BUT IS BUILDING
POD1000000026_S0000047	SO HAVING ANOTHER BUILDER WAS EXCITING I'M LIKE OH SOMEBODY ELSE CARES ABOUT THIS STUFF
POD1000000026_S0000048	I THINK MAYBE WHERE MIKE AND I OVERLAP MOST IS THE FACT THAT WE BOTH LOVE TO MAKE THINGS
POD1000000026_S0000049	MY DREAM WAS ALWAYS TO BUILD SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE USED
POD1000000026_S0000050	SO OUR FRIENDSHIP REVOLVES AROUND THAT
POD1000000026_S0000051	AND IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT THAT ALSO HAPPENS TO BE A PROFESSION
POD1000000026_S0000052	I DID KNOW THAT HE WAS WORKING ON URBAN
POD1000000026_S0000053	I THINK I ALREADY HAD MAYBE INSTALLED IT AND WAS PLAYING AROUND WITH IT
POD1000000026_S0000054	IT WAS A CHECK IN APP I LET YOU CHECK IN AT DIFFERENT PLACES
POD1000000026_S0000055	IT WAS A WAY OF SHARING WHAT YOU WERE UP TO AND WHERE YOU WERE
POD1000000026_S0000056	WITH THE TWIST THAT YOU COULD ADD PHOTOS AND VIDEOS TO IT WHICH IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE WAS ACTUALLY THE ONLY ONE I COULD FIND THAT COULD DO THAT
POD1000000026_S0000057	AND EVEN THOUGH YOU HAD TO JUMP THROUGH ALL THESE HOOPS TO UPLOAD A PHOTO ON URBAN
POD1000000026_S0000058	PEOPLE WERE DOING IT AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IT WASN'T JUST THIS PERSON IS HERE BUT OH THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE THERE
POD1000000026_S0000059	SO THAT WAS TO ME THE INKLING OF SOMETHING INTERESTING IN URBAN
POD1000000026_S0000060	YOU KNOW I WAS PITCHING IT TO INVESTORS AND ONE OF THE INVESTORS WAS LIKE YEAH HERE'S FIFTY GRAND
POD1000000026_S0000061	YOU CAN GO WORK ON THIS AND LIKE TAKE A SMALL SMALL STIPEND
POD1000000026_S0000062	BUT YOU HAVE TO GET A CO FOUNDER THESE THINGS WORK BEST WHEN YOU HAVE A COFOUNDER
POD1000000026_S0000063	HE WAS SAYING HEY LOOK AT ALL THE BEST COMPANIES IN THE WORLD
POD1000000026_S0000064	THE LIKE ONES THAT REALLY WORK ARE THE ONES WHERE GENERALLY THERE'S MORE THAN ONE SOLO PERSON RUNNING THE SHIP
POD1000000026_S0000065	GOOGLE WAS A CO FOUNDER PAIR
POD1000000026_S0000066	YOUTUBE WAS A CO FOUNDER PAIR
POD1000000026_S0000067	THE POINT IS WHEN YOU HAVE A TEAM YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO SUCCEED
POD1000000026_S0000068	I AGREED WITH THAT I MEAN THE PATTERN WAS CLEARLY THERE THE EVIDENCE WAS THERE
POD1000000026_S0000069	SO I KIND OF WENT THROUGH THE ROLEX IN MY MIND OF LIKE WHO DO I KNOW THAT COULD BE A CO FOUNDER
POD1000000026_S0000070	AND I REMEMBER RUNNING INTO MICE AND I THINK THE NEXT TIME I RAN INTO HIM I FLOATED THE IDEA HEY LIKE MAYBE WE SHOULD WORK TOGETHER ON THIS
POD1000000026_S0000071	WE BASICALLY DECIDED WE WERE GOING TO PROTOTYPE WORKING TOGETHER
POD1000000026_S0000072	SO WE WOULD GET TOGETHER AT A CAFE NEAR MIKE'S HOUSE AND WE CREATED A FAKE PROJECT
POD1000000026_S0000073	WHY WE DIDN'T JUST WORK ON URBAN I DON'T KNOW BUT WE CREATED A FAKE PROJECT WITH A FAKE OUTCOME WE WANTED TO ACCOMPLISH THAT NIGHT
POD1000000026_S0000074	MIKE WOULD DO ONE HALF OF IT I'D DO A DIFFERENT HALF OF IT AND WE'D COME TOGETHER AND WE'D ASK QUESTIONS FIGURE OUT HOW EACH OTHER WORKED
POD1000000026_S0000075	AND WE REALLY ENJOYED THAT EXPERIENCE
POD1000000026_S0000076	SO YOU KNOW I REMEMBER THIS FATEFUL DAY STANDING AT THE CALTRAIN STATION BEFORE MIKE HAD TO GO TO WORK AND
POD1000000026_S0000077	I WAS LIKE MIKE I REALLY WANT TO WORK TOGETHER
POD1000000026_S0000078	MY HEAD I WAS PROBABLY LIKE REALLY WANT TO WORK TOGETHER AND I REALLY NEED THIS FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS RIGHT SO I NEED A CO FOUNDER TOO
POD1000000026_S0000079	AND I ASKED HIM THIS QUESTION AND I JUST REMEMBER HIS RESPONSE HE'S LIKE COUNT ME INTERESTED
POD1000000026_S0000081	COUNT ME INTERESTED LIKE YOU KNOW ARE YOU IN ARE YOU OUT
POD1000000026_S0000082	I VIVIDLY REMEMBER THE MOMENT HE ASKED BECAUSE I HAD ONE OF THOSE LIKE FLASHING BEFORE YOUR EYES BUT NOT THE PAST THE FUTURE
POD1000000026_S0000083	I WAS LIKE OKAY I CAN BE WORKING WITH SOMEBODY WHO I HAVE COME TO REALLY START RESPECTING AND I WANT TO WORK WITH
POD1000000026_S0000084	AND THAT'S WHERE COUNT ME INTERESTED CAME FROM WHICH TO ME SOUNDED LIKE A YES BUT YOU KNOW MAYBE I WAS A LITTLE BOY
POD1000000026_S0000085	BUT TO ME IT WAS JUST LIKE OH YEAH OF COURSE
POD1000000026_S0000086	I'M GOING TO ASK YOU A QUESTION OKAY
POD1000000026_S0000087	I WANT A LITTLE BIT OF
POD1000000026_S0000088	UNDERSTANDING HERE
POD1000000026_S0000089	YOU'RE NOW MARRIED
POD1000000026_S0000090	I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU PROPOSE YOUR WIFE BUT WHEN YOU ASKED HER TO MARRY YOU IF SHE HAD COME BACK AND SAID COUNT ME INTERESTED
POD1000000026_S0000091	WOULD YOU HAVE BEEN LIKE THAT WAS A YES
POD1000000026_S0000093	FOR CLARIFICATION
POD1000000026_S0000095	I LOOK BACK ON A LOT OF THE MAJOR DECISIONS IN MY LIFE THAT I'VE MADE
POD1000000026_S0000096	THIS ONE IS AN EASIER ONE WHERE I KNEW THAT IT WAS WHAT I WANTED TO DO AND THEN THE NEXT WEEK WAS LOGISTICALLY CAN I DO IT

POD1000000026_S0000102	I THINK THIS IS THE FIRST MOMENT WHERE I REALLY STARTED FEELING THIS SORT OF MUTUAL TRUST WITH KEVIN
POD1000000026_S0000103	AS THE COUNT ME INTERESTED MOMENT WAS JANUARY AND WE APPLIED YOU KNOW SOON AFTERWARDS

POD1000000026_S0000114	IT FINALLY CAME AND THAT POINT IT WAS LIKE ALRIGHT I CAN ACTUALLY JOIN AND ACTUALLY DO THIS STUFF TOGETHER
POD1000000026_S0000115	WE HAD BEEN WORKING ON URBAN FOR A WHILE EIGHT NINE MONTHS OR SOMETHING BY THAT TIME
POD1000000026_S0000116	AND WE WERE MEETING ONE OF OUR EARLY INVESTORS
POD1000000026_S0000117	AND HE WAS LIKE SO WHAT ARE YOU BUILDING WHAT'S UP LIKE WHAT'S NEW

POD1000000026_S0000121	AND WE WERE SO SAD AFTER THAT MEETING BECAUSE IT WAS SO CLEAR TO US THAT WE COULDN'T EXPLAIN WHAT WE WERE WORKING ON
POD1000000026_S0000122	SO WE WENT BACK TO THE OFFICE WE SAT IN FRONT OF A WHITEBOARD AND WE SAID OKAY WE HAVE TO FOCUS THIS THING
POD1000000026_S0000123	TRYING TO DO TOO MUCH ALL AT ONCE
POD1000000026_S0000124	SO WE STRIPPED EVERYTHING AWAY THAT DAY
POD1000000026_S0000125	AND WE FOCUSED JUST ON THE COMPONENTS THAT WOULD EFFECTIVELY BECOME INSTAGRAM
POD1000000026_S0000126	AND MAYBE IN THE COURSE OF A WEEK OR TWO MADE THE FIRST VERSION OF INSTAGRAM
POD1000000026_S0000127	I SPENT FAR MORE TIME WITH KEVIN THAN ANY OTHER HUMAN BEING FOR THAT FIRST YEAR OF INSTAGRAM EASILY RIGHT LIKE WE WERE IN THERE EVERY SINGLE DAY
POD1000000026_S0000128	TWELVE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN HOURS SOMETIMES OVERNIGHT

POD1000000026_S0000132	PEOPLE LIKED IT PEOPLE STARTED USING IT
POD1000000026_S0000133	I WAS TAKEN ABACK BECAUSE I MEAN I HAD WORKED AT A COMPANY BEFORE THAT STRUGGLED TO GET TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE TO USE IT OVER A YEAR
POD1000000026_S0000134	AND WE GOT TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND THAT FIRST DAY
POD1000000026_S0000135	AND I REMEMBER TURNING TO MIKE AND I SAID I THINK WE'VE CREATED SOMETHING
POD1000000026_S0000136	I'M USUALLY THE PESSIMIST AND MIKE IS USUALLY I'M NOT SURE OPTIMIST BUT YOU'RE PRAGMATIST RIGHT
POD1000000026_S0000137	BUT LIKE I HAD THIS MOMENT OF CLARITY THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL BECAUSE I'D NEVER SEEN PEOPLE REACT THIS WAY
POD1000000026_S0000138	AND MIKE JUST LOOKED AT ME LIKE I DON'T KNOW MAYBE NOT MAYBE THIS IS ALL GOING TO COME CRASHING DOWN
POD1000000026_S0000139	THE ONE LITTLE DINKY SERVER THAT WE HAD WAS JUST LIKE METAPHORICALLY AND PERHAPS PHYSICALLY MELTING BY ALL THE TRAFFIC THAT WAS COMING AT IT
POD1000000026_S0000140	I REALLY FELT LIKE WE HAD SQUANDERED THIS OPPORTUNITY
POD1000000026_S0000141	AND I WAS LIKE PROBABLY ADD ANOTHER SERVER
POD1000000026_S0000142	AND KEVIN WAS LIKE NO WE DON'T NEED ANOTHER
POD1000000026_S0000143	YOU KNOW IN RETROSPECT I THINK IT WAS LIKE YOU KNOW WE DIDN'T KNOW IF THIS THING WAS GOING TO TAKE OFF AND IT WAS EXPENSIVE TO ANOTHER SERVER LIKE DID WE REALLY NEED IT
POD1000000026_S0000144	NO I THINK WE DO
POD1000000026_S0000145	AND THEN LIKE LATER HE'S LIKE OH MAN SORRY LIKE I WAS LITTLE HEAT
POD1000000026_S0000146	YOU KNOW WE'D BEEN UP FOR THIRTY SIX HOURS AT THAT POINT KIND OF FIGHTING OFF SLEEP AND ALSO EXCITED
POD1000000026_S0000148	BOTH THE BEST AND WORST DAYS OF OUR LIVES
POD1000000026_S0000149	YOU KNOW THE THING WAS WORKING BUT ALSO WAS CRASHING
POD1000000026_S0000150	I THINK THAT WAS LIKE THE ONLY TIME WE'VE EVER RAISED OUR VOICES WITH EACH OTHER
POD1000000026_S0000151	WAS BRIEF IT WAS LIKE PROBABLY THIRTY SECOND INTERACTION
POD1000000026_S0000152	I APPROVE THIS MESSAGE
POD1000000026_S0000154	WHICH IS TRUE LIKE THAT WAS THE ONE TIME THAT IT WAS HEATED AND IT WAS JUST THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT
POD1000000026_S0000155	I'M ACTUALLY GONNA TAKE IT WAY BACK OUR FIRST DISAGREEMENT WHICH I ACTUALLY HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IN MANY YEARS
POD1000000026_S0000156	TWO OR THREE WEEKS INTO WORKING TOGETHER I REMEMBER COMING IN ONE DAY AND SAYING
POD1000000026_S0000157	WHAT DO YOU THINK OF US LIKE ONE OR TWO DAYS A WEEK JUST WORKING FROM HOME BECAUSE I CAN JUST JAM ON STUFF AND JUST STAY UP ALL NIGHT AND CODE AND I'LL BE UP TILL NOON
POD1000000026_S0000158	LIKE I THINK I'LL WORK BETTER THAT WAY AND YOU'RE LIKE
POD1000000026_S0000159	NO I'D REALLY LIKE FOR US TO BE IN THE SAME OFFICE TOGETHER I THINK THAT MATTERS A LOT
POD1000000026_S0000160	AND I REMEMBER BEING ANNOYED FOR LIKE TEN SECONDS
POD1000000026_S0000162	I WAS LIKE OKAY LIKE SURE LIKE WE GIVE THAT A TRY
POD1000000026_S0000163	YOU KNOW AND LIKE IN THE END IT WAS GREAT LIKE WE WERE ABLE TO JAM ON IDEAS AND MOVE REALLY QUICKLY AND
POD1000000026_S0000164	IF I HAD TO LIKE ABSTRACT IT AND WHAT I LEARNED ABOUT WORKING WITH KEVIN OVER THE YEARS IT WAS I DON'T THINK YOU'RE EVER A PERSON THAT WILL JUST AGREE TO SOMETHING BECAUSE IT WILL MAKE SOMEBODY ELSE HAPPY
POD1000000026_S0000165	BUT YOU ALSO MAKE SURE THAT IN DISAGREEING YOU'RE ALSO NOT BEING A JERK AND MAKING THEM FEEL BAD ABOUT FEELING DIFFERENTLY YOU'RE LIKE
POD1000000026_S0000166	NOW I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS AND HERE'S WHAT I WANT TO DO
POD1000000026_S0000167	IS THERE LIKE A REASON WHY YOU KNOW YOU REALLY FEEL DIFFERENTLY AND THEN WE CAN HAVE THE CONVERSATION
POD1000000026_S0000168	THAT SORT OF LIKE DETOXIFIED ABILITY TO DISAGREE IS REALLY IMPORTANT
POD1000000026_S0000169	I GET ANNOYED REALLY EASILY
POD1000000026_S0000170	BUT THE INTERESTING THING IS MIKE DOESN'T ANNOY ME LIKE HE REALLY DOESN'T
POD1000000026_S0000171	I REALLY DON'T GET ANNOYED WITH MIKE BECAUSE HE HAS CHARACTER AND INTEGRITY
POD1000000026_S0000172	THOSE ARE THE TWO THINGS I CARE ABOUT
POD1000000026_S0000173	IF YOU'RE JUST A GENERALLY GOOD PERSON AND WHEN YOU SAY YOU'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING YOU DO IT
POD1000000026_S0000174	WHO CARES IF LIKE YOU KNOW MIKE CHOSE THE WRONG X Y OR Z TO SOLVE A PROBLEM OR MAYBE INTRODUCED A BUG OR WHAT LIKE I DON'T CARE
POD1000000026_S0000175	MIKE HAS NEVER MADE EXCEPT FOR THAT ONE TIME ON THE SERVER ISSUE MIKE HAS NEVER MADE ME ANGRY
POD1000000026_S0000176	I DON'T THINK WE EVER ACTUALLY HAD TITLES FOR THE LONGEST TIME
POD1000000026_S0000177	I GUESS ONCE WE STARTED DOING PUBLIC YOU KNOW EVENTS AND WE HAD TO TALK ABOUT WHAT OUR TITLES WERE
POD1000000026_S0000178	THERE WAS A TIME WHERE WE WERE LIKE OKAY YOU'RE CEO I'M CEO AND WE KIND OF LIKE DIVIDED IT THAT WAY
POD1000000026_S0000179	BUT YOU ALWAYS SAY COFOUNDER FIRST THAT'S THE TITLE
POD1000000026_S0000180	WHEN I THOUGHT ABOUT MY IDENTITY AND LIKE WHAT WE WERE DOING THE COMPANY WAS LIKE CO FOUNDER MAYBE TECHNICAL CO FOUNDER IF YOU WANTED TO PUT AN ADJECTIVE IN FRONT OF IT
POD1000000026_S0000181	REQUIRED TECHNICAL CO FOUNDER
POD1000000026_S0000184	BUT I DO ALSO THINK THIS SPEAKS TO OUR PERSONALITY AND OUR RELATIONSHIP IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ANY COMPANY TO ULTIMATELY HAVE ONE FINAL DECISION
POD1000000026_S0000185	I'VE SEEN SO MANY COMPANIES NOT HAVE ONE AND IT BECOMES A MESS SOMETIMES THERE'S A TYPE BREAK NEEDED OR SOMETIMES LIKE CALL NEEDS TO GET MADE
POD1000000026_S0000186	YOU REALLY NEED TO FIND SOMEBODY WHO'S WILLING TO LIKE MAKE THAT CALL AND YOU ALL HAVE TO BE READY TO LIKE MAKE THAT PERSON SUCCESSFUL IN THAT ROLE OR ELSE IT'S JUST NOT GOING TO WORK
POD1000000026_S0000187	WE HAD A BUNCH OF PEOPLE THAT REALLY WANTED INSTAGRAM INSIDE THEIR COMPANY
POD1000000026_S0000188	BUT WE WERE HAVING SO MUCH FUN DOING OUR OWN THING THAT LIKE WE JUST DIDN'T WANT TO LIKE BE PART OF ANY OTHER COMPANY
POD1000000026_S0000189	DIDN'T WANT TO BE A WING OF A BUILDING WE WANTED TO BE THE BUILDING
POD1000000026_S0000190	AND I REMEMBER YOU TURNED TO ME AT ONE POINT YOU'RE LIKE I REALLY DON'T THINK WE SHOULD LIKE PURSUE ANY OF THESE
POD1000000026_S0000191	LIKE I THINK WE'RE BETTER OFF INDEPENDENT BUT IF YOU FEEL DIFFERENTLY LIKE LET ME KNOW LIKE LET'S HAVE THAT CONVERSATION
POD1000000026_S0000192	WAS HELPFUL BECAUSE IT MADE ME REFLECT AND BE LIKE NO NO THIS IS REALLY
POD1000000026_S0000193	I'M WORKING WITH SOMEBODY I DEEPLY RESPECT WERE STARTING TO BUILD A TEAM THAT'S WORKING
POD1000000026_S0000194	YEAH LET'S LIKE LET'S KEEP DOING THIS THING WE STILL GOT MONEY IN THE BANK
POD1000000026_S0000195	SO YOU KNOW FOR THE LONGEST TIME WE WERE JUST LIKE WE'RE GONNA DO THIS THING OURSELVES
POD1000000026_S0000196	AND THE ONLY TIME WE LITERALLY HAD LIKE A NUMBER TO FACE WAS THE FACEBOOK OFFER
POD1000000026_S0000197	WHEN WE WERE LIKE OH A BILLION DOLLARS JUST SOUNDS FUNNY TO SAY RIGHT LIKE
POD1000000026_S0000198	IT'S A BILLION YOU THINK OF LIKE DR EVIL IN ONE OF THESE MOVIES RIGHT
POD1000000026_S0000199	BUT SOMEONE COMES ALONG AND OFFERS YOU A BILLION DOLLARS FOR SOMETHING YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR I DON'T KNOW ALL OF A YEAR PUBLICLY AND THEN YOU'VE GOT ELEVEN EMPLOYEES AND YOU'RE JUST LIKE MAN I LIKE HOW DO YOU EVEN DO THAT CALCULUS LIKE
POD1000000026_S0000200	WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT
POD1000000026_S0000201	I REALLY REMEMBER BEING IN SORT OF LIKE A DAZE IT'S LIKE EVERYTHING WAS JUST VERY STRANGE
POD1000000026_S0000202	WE HAD A LONG CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT WE WANTED TO DO
POD1000000026_S0000203	AT THE END OF THE DAY THE THING THAT MATTERED THE MOST TO US WAS THAT THEY WANTED US TO KEEP RUNNING IT INDEPENDENTLY LIKE WE HAD BEEN DOING THE
POD1000000026_S0000204	THEY WERE LIKE NO INSTAGRAM IS A THING
POD1000000026_S0000205	YOUR COMMUNITY YOU GUYS HAVE EFFECTIVELY A TEAM AND A COMPANY AND CULTURE
POD1000000026_S0000206	KEEP DOING THAT
POD1000000026_S0000207	AND WE STAYED SIX YEARS
POD1000000026_S0000208	THERE WAS A LOT OF LIKE HEY CHECKING IN HOW ARE YOU FEELING WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO LIKE
POD1000000026_S0000209	WE ONLY WANTED TO BE AT INSTAGRAM IF THE OTHER PERSON WAS AT INSTAGRAM
POD1000000026_S0000210	EVERY JANUARY I WOULD DECIDE I WANTED TO CONSCIOUSLY RECOMMIT TO STILL BEING THERE
POD1000000026_S0000211	MAKE IT AN INTENTIONAL
POD1000000026_S0000212	I COME AROUND IN JANUARY AND I SAY IS THIS STILL WHAT I WANT TO BE LEARNING
POD1000000026_S0000213	VOWED TO MYSELF IT'S FUNNY THE VOWS YOU MAKE TO YOURSELF WHEN YOU'RE EIGHTEEN YEARS
POD1000000026_S0000214	I TOLD MYSELF WHEN I WAS EIGHTEEN I WANTED TO HAVE A LIFE FULL OF UNIQUE YEARS NOT THE SAME YEAR OVER AND OVER
POD1000000026_S0000215	THAT WAS MY BIGGEST FEAR
POD1000000026_S0000216	AND I LOOKED AND I WAS LIKE I FEEL LIKE YOU KNOW WE'VE DONE INCREDIBLY HARD THINGS
POD1000000026_S0000217	I'VE LEARNED A TON BUT IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE ON SOME LIKE DIMINISHING RETURNS CURVE OF LEARNING
POD1000000026_S0000218	AND I REMEMBER DINNER WITH KEVIN WAS LIKE HEY MAN LIKE I FEEL LIKE IT MIGHT BE TIME FOR ME TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT WHICH IS LIKE A HARD CONVERSE LIKE IT'S A SCARY CONVERSATION TO HAVE
POD1000000026_S0000219	KEVIN TURNED TO ME SAID LIKE GET WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM
POD1000000026_S0000220	IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU THINK WOULD STILL FEEL LIKE A NEW INTERESTING THING
POD1000000026_S0000221	LIKE LISTED A COUPLE OF THINGS
POD1000000026_S0000222	AND THEN I HAD THE INTERESTING EXPERIENCE OF KIND OF DOING PART OF KEVIN'S JOB FOR A FEW MONTHS BECAUSE HE WENT OUT ON MATERNITY LEAVE
POD1000000026_S0000223	AND HE WAS OUT AND HE SAID MIKE I'M ON MATERNITY LEAVE I REALLY WANT TO BE PRESENT WITH MY KIDS LIKE
POD1000000026_S0000224	CAN YOU MAKE SURE THINGS GO WELL WHILE I'M AWAY
POD1000000026_S0000225	AND IT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE IN MY HEAD I ALWAYS HAD THIS QUESTION LIKE IS THE ONE THING THAT WOULD MAKE ME STAY LIKE TO HAVE THIS VERY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE OF BEING CEO RATHER THAN TO
POD1000000026_S0000226	GOT TO HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE FOR LIKE TWO MONTHS
POD1000000026_S0000227	REMEMBER KEVIN CUTTING BACK LIKE KEVIN I DO NOT WANT YOUR JOB
POD1000000026_S0000228	AND LIKE WE ALWAYS JOKED THAT ONE OF THE REASONS WE WORKED TOGETHER IS THAT WE DIDN'T WANT EACH OTHER'S JOBS
POD1000000026_S0000229	AND AT SOME POINT I FELT LIKE A THING I'D ALWAYS SAID AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE IT WAS ACTUALLY REALLY TRUE
POD1000000026_S0000230	BUT I REMEMBER AT THE END OF THAT EXPERIENCE BEING LIKE NO I'M REALLY GLAD I GOT TO TRY IT BECAUSE IT MADE ME REALIZE LIKE WHERE MY HAPPY SPOT IS IS NOT IN THAT ROLE
POD1000000026_S0000231	IN THE ROLE I WAS IN AND IN THAT ROLE I FEEL LIKE I'VE ACCOMPLISHED WHAT I WANTED TO ACCOMPLISH
POD1000000026_S0000232	AND I WANTED SOMETHING HARD
POD1000000026_S0000233	I WANTED TO BE BAD AT SOMETHING AGAIN
POD1000000026_S0000234	MAYBE IT WON'T BE AS BIG AS INSTAGRAM MAYBE IT WON'T
POD1000000026_S0000235	PROBABLY WON'T BE AS BIG AS INSTAGRAM LET'S BE HONEST
POD1000000026_S0000236	BUT MAYBE IT'LL BE JUST AS FUN TO LEARN ALONG THE WAY
POD1000000026_S0000237	THAT'S ULTIMATELY WHAT MADE ME WANT TO JUMP
POD1000000026_S0000238	BUT WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT WE WERE GOING TO DO
POD1000000026_S0000239	THE FIRST THING WAS REST AND RECOVERY
POD1000000026_S0000240	WE WERE KIND OF OFF DOING OUR OWN THING WE WANTED TO JUST CHILL OUT AND DISCONNECT A LITTLE BIT BUT WE RECONNECTED AND IT WAS LIKE YEAH WHAT DO YOU MISS THE MOST
POD1000000026_S0000241	IT'S LIKE WELL I MISS HANGING OUT OF COURSE AND YOU SAY THOSE NICE THINGS TO EACH OTHER BUT I MISS BUILDING STUFF
POD1000000026_S0000242	I LEARNED A BIG LESSON I THINK IN THE MIDDLE MONTHS BEFORE WE REALLY RECONNECTED WHICH WAS I THINK I'M HOLDING THIS IDEA OF KEVIN IN MY HEAD OF LIKE
POD1000000026_S0000243	I BET HE'S LIKE ALREADY THOUGHT OF LIKE WHAT'S NEXT AND LIKE HE HASN'T TOLD ME ABOUT
POD1000000026_S0000244	I REALIZED LIKE
POD1000000026_S0000245	OH NO
POD1000000026_S0000246	I CREATED THIS LIKE THING OF LIKE LIKE WE HAVEN'T TALKED
POD1000000026_S0000247	YOU THINK ABOUT IT I'VE NEVER YOU KNOW ACTUAL THOUGHT ABOUT THIS BUT LIKE THAT WAS THE LONGEST WE WENT WITHOUT REALLY TALKING IN NINE YEARS
POD1000000026_S0000248	
POD1000000026_S0000250	WAS LIKE MAN LIKE WE HAVEN'T TALKED WHICH MUST MEAN THAT LIKE HE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK TO
POD1000000026_S0000251	AND I REMEMBER HAVING THIS PHONE CALL THAT WAS SO LIKE WHAT A RELIEF LIKE WE TALKED ON THE PHONE AND YOU'RE LIKE YEAH LIKE WHERE YOU ARE
POD1000000026_S0000252	LIKE I HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF WHAT'S NEXT I'D LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU AND I LOVE I LOVE TO KEEP WORKING WITH YOU TOO
POD1000000026_S0000253	TO ME THE LESSON LEARNED WAS LIKE IF YOU HAVE LIKE A VERY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMEBODY AND THEN YOU JUST DON'T TALK TO THEM FOR A FEW MONTHS LIKE
POD1000000026_S0000254	YOUR BRAIN IS GOING TO START ASSUMING THAT THAT SILENCE MEANS SOMETHING THAT IT ABSOLUTELY DOES
POD1000000026_S0000255	JUST MEANT THAT WE JUST NEEDED SOME TIME TO CLEAR OUR HEADS AND HAVE OUR OWN THING
POD1000000026_S0000256	SHE TALKED LIKE OH OKAY GREAT HE FEELS THE SAME WAY I DO WHICH IS LIKE WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT IS YET BUT WE WANT TO DO IT WITH EACH OTHER
POD1000000026_S0000257	AND THAT WAS A REAL LIKE RELIEF FOR ME WAS LIKE GREAT WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE AND NOW WE CAN JUST SPEND THE TIME TO EXPLORE AND FIGURE OUT WHAT WE'RE EXCITED TO BUILD NEXT
POD1000000026_S0000258	BOTH OF US WANTED TO DO SOMETHING TOGETHER AGAIN
POD1000000026_S0000259	LIKE THAT WAS RARE LIKE MOST CO FOUNDER PAIRS FIND THEMSELVES IN SOME SORT OF FIGHT ALONG THE WAY AND BREAK UP AND
POD1000000026_S0000260	THE IDEA THAT WE COULD HAVE A NEW CHALLENGE TOGETHER POTENTIALLY I THINK WAS WHAT MADE IT WAY MORE EXCITING
POD1000000026_S0000261	I'M NOT SURE WE WERE LIKE LOOKING FOR PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WHEN WE STARTED LIKE A FRIENDSHIP
POD1000000026_S0000262	BUT THE BOND WE HAVE NOW
POD1000000026_S0000264	I THINK I'D LIKE TO PEOPLE WHO LIKE WERE IN THE MILITARY TOGETHER
POD1000000026_S0000265	I'M NOT LIKE SAYING WE WE DID ANYTHING EVEN CLOSE TO AS IMPORTANT AS THAT BUT WHEN YOU GO THROUGH THINGS WITH SOMEONE WHEN PEOPLE TRY TO KILL YOUR COMPANY WHEN PEOPLE TRY TO THROW YOU INTO THE BUS
POD1000000026_S0000266	ALL THIS STUFF HAS HAPPENED TO US AND THEN SOME
POD1000000026_S0000267	AND I REMEMBER VERY SPECIFICALLY THIS MOMENT WE WERE HAVING A DISAGREEMENT WITH AN INVESTOR
POD1000000026_S0000268	AND WE WERE SO STRESSED OUT AND WE WENT TO THIS REALLY TERRIBLE TAKARA ON MARKET STREET
POD1000000026_S0000269	BUT WE SAT DOWN AND WE BOTH ORDERED LIKE THE GREATEST THING WE COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE
POD1000000026_S0000270	AND HONESTLY THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN LOW IN THE COMPANY BUT IT WAS A HIGH FOR ME
POD1000000026_S0000271	LIKE I LOOK BACK ON THAT MOMENT REALLY FONDLY BECAUSE IT WAS US AGAINST THE WORLD
POD1000000026_S0000272	IT WAS LIKE WE'RE GOING TO WIN THIS THING EVEN IF PEOPLE DON'T BELIEVE IN US EVEN IF WE'RE HAVING THIS THING GO ON LIKE WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THIS WORK
POD1000000026_S0000273	CALL IT FRIENDSHIP BUT THAT IS LIKE A BOND THAT YOU DON'T FORM HANGING OUT
POD1000000026_S0000274	THE FACT THAT WE STILL LIKED EACH OTHER THIS LONG I THINK SPEAKS TO LIKE A DEEPER TRUST AND LIKE REAL BOND
POD1000000026_S0000275	BUT I THINK THE FACT THAT WE LIKED EACH OTHER AFTER THAT FIRST YEAR WHICH WAS LIKE PURE EXPOSURE SPOKE TO TRUST BUT I THINK ALSO JUST TO
POD1000000026_S0000276	WE HAVE A WAY ABOUT EACH OTHER THAT IS NOT ONE THAT WE FIND ANNOYING
POD1000000026_S0000277	WHICH SOUNDS TRIVIAL BUT ACTUALLY WHEN YOU'RE THAT AROUND SOMEBODY FOR THAT LONG FOR THAT MANY DAYS
POD1000000026_S0000278	AND YOU HAVEN'T SHOWERED IN THREE DAYS SOMETIMES AND YOU'RE EATING THE SAME LUNCH YOU'VE EATEN EVERY SINGLE DAY LIKE

POD1000000026_S0000280	I THINK THAT WAS A REGARD WHERE WE PROBABLY GOT LUCKY

POD1000000028_S0000229	BUT TO ME IT WAS JUST A CHANCE TO SEE THE BEST ATHLETE IN HER SPORT
POD1000000028_S0000231	I WAS FOCUSED ON NADIA THE AUDIENCE WAS FOCUSED ON NADIA A LOT OF YOU KNOW VERY EXCITED YOUNG GIRLS THIS WAS LIKE BEATLEMANIA NADIA MANIA WAS DEFINITELY A REAL THING
POD1000000028_S0000233	BELLA CAROL WAS VERY VISIBLE AND HE WAS UNMISTAKABLE ON THE FLOOR HUGE GUY HE WAS IN OUR EYES THE GURU THE GENIUS BEHIND NADIA'S PRECISION AND PERFECTION
POD1000000028_S0000234	BEING ON TOUR WITH BELLA AS THE ROMANIANS COACH IT WAS INTERESTING TO WATCH HIM AND THE GYMNAST REALLY JUST HOW THEY INTERACTED WITH EACH OTHER
POD1000000028_S0000235	THE U S NATIONAL TEAM HAD BEEN INVITED TO PERFORM WITH THE ROMANIANS ON THEIR TOUR TRACY TALAVERA WAS A MEMBER OF THAT TEAM
POD1000000028_S0000236	THE GYMNASTS WERE ALWAYS VERY STERN VERY ROBOTIC THEY WORKED EXTREMELY HARD THEY DID NUMBERS OF ROUTINES AND SKILLS WAY BEYOND WHAT WE HAD EVER SEEN
POD1000000028_S0000237	MIKE JACQUI THE MAN WHO WOULD BECOME THE PRESIDENT OF THE U S GYMNASTICS FEDERATION WAS ON THE TOUR WORKING FOR ONE OF THE EQUIPMENT SPONSORS HE HAD A FRONT ROW SEAT TO THE PAROLLES
POD1000000028_S0000238	MARTA WAS IN THE BACKGROUND SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING BELLA INSTRUCTED HER LIKE HE INSTRUCTED EVERYBODY ELSE SHE WAS VERY SUBSERVIENT I MEAN IT WAS NOT A COACHING DUEL
POD1000000028_S0000239	HE WAS DEFINITELY THE COACH AND SHE WAS DEFINITELY THE THIRD ASSISTANT EVEN THOUGH THERE WASN'T A FIRST OR SECOND ASSISTANT
POD1000000028_S0000240	BUT DESPITE HOW WELL THE TOUR WAS GOING THINGS BEHIND THE SCENES WERE DETERIORATING FOR THE ROMANIAN COACHES
POD1000000028_S0000241	THEY COULD TELL FROM THE WAY OFFICIALS WERE TREATING THEM THAT THEY WERE IN DANGER OF LOSING THEIR JOBS AND THEIR PRESTIGE
POD1000000028_S0000242	WE WENT THERE AND WE WERE TREATED VERY POORLY FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE TOUR I MEAN THE PRESIDENT OF THE GYMNASTICS FEDERATION WAS VERY GAVE US A COLD SHOWER
POD1000000028_S0000243	ON THE WASHINGTON DC STOP THEY WERE INVITED TO A DINNER PARTY HOSTED BY THE ROMANIAN AMBASSADOR
POD1000000028_S0000244	AND THE DINNER PARTY NOBODY WOULD TALK TO US WE LOOK AT US LIKE STRANGERS NOT EVEN PART OF THE TEAM I THINK WE HAD OUR FEELING THAT SOMETHING WAS GOING ON
POD1000000028_S0000245	BELLA SAID THAT I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE ANY FUTURE BACK IN ROMANIA
POD1000000028_S0000246	THE TOUR WAS ALMOST OVER IN TWO DAYS THEY'D BE HEADED HOME THE PAROLES IN GAZA NEW THINGS COULD ONLY GET WORSE FOR THEM THAT THEIR FAVOR WITH A FICKLE AND PUNITIVE GOVERNMENT WAS WANING
POD1000000028_S0000247	THEY WERE TIRED OF THE SCRUTINY IN ROMANIA EVERYONE WAS WATCHED ALL THE TIME BELLA HAD FANTASIZED ABOUT WHAT A LIFE IN THE UNITED STATES COULD BE
POD1000000028_S0000248	THEY HAD TO MAKE A DECISION
POD1000000028_S0000249	WE MADE THE PLAN
POD1000000028_S0000250	AFTER THE FINAL SHOW THE TEAM RETURNED TO NEW YORK BEFORE TRAVELING BACK TO ROMANIA BUT THE COACHES HAD NO INTENTION OF GETTING ON THAT PLANE
POD1000000028_S0000251	MARTHA HAD AN AUNT WITH A PLACE IN MANHATTAN THAT THEY COULD USE TO HIDE OUT FOR A FEW DAYS IN ORDER TO GET THERE GAZE WOULD HAVE TO DISTRACT HIS ROOMMATE THE HEAD OF THE ROMANIAN SECURITY DETAIL
POD1000000028_S0000252	THE PLAN WAS THAT I WILL TAKE THE SECRET SERVICE GUY OUT TO SHOPPING AND THEN WE MEET THE APARTMENT
POD1000000028_S0000254	THE MORNING OF MARCH THIRTIETH NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE TRUDY AND HER TEAMMATES WERE TOLD THEY COULD GO SHOPPING AS LONG AS THEY WERE BACK IN TIME TO BOARD A BUS TO JFK AIRPORT AT NOON
POD1000000028_S0000255	SO WE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY AND WE MET DOWN IN THE HALLWAY AND THEY SAID OKAY SO YOU HAVE TWO HOURS NO FUNNY BUSINESS NO CHOCOLATES NO EATING NO NOTHING
POD1000000028_S0000256	THEN WE ALL WENT OUT THE DOOR PROBABLY I WALKED LIKE TEN STEPS AND BELLA SAYS TRULY
POD1000000028_S0000257	I NEEDED TO COME BACK I STARTED CRYING I SAID OH MY GOSH WHAT HAVE I DONE WRONG THIS TIME HE SAID YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO COME BACK WITH US IN OUR ROOM I STARTED CRYING BECAUSE I THOUGHT YOU KNOW I MEAN JUST THE FEAR OF WHAT HAVE I DONE WRONG
POD1000000028_S0000258	RUDY FOLLOWED BELLA'S ORDERS AND WENT BACK TO THEIR ROOM WITH MARTA
POD1000000028_S0000259	I GO BACK WITH MARA TO THE HOTEL ROOM AND VERY UNUSUAL BEHAVIOR SHE WENT LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW WENT WALKED BACK TO THE DOOR LOOKED TO THE WINDOW WALKED BACK TO THE DOOR AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF WHAT IN THE WORLD GOSH NOW I'M SUPPOSED TO BE WAITING TO GET BEATEN UP
POD1000000028_S0000260	AND I THINK WE WAITED A GOOD HALF AN HOUR AND THEN HE COMES THROUGH THE DOOR WITH THIS KIND OF LOOK ON HIS FACE HIS FACE LIKE HE WAS ALL PALE AND STUFF LIKE THAT HE SAYS DUDE WE'RE NOT COMING BACK ANYMORE
POD1000000028_S0000261	WHEN I HEARD THAT I ASKED WHAT THAT'S THE FIRST TIME THAT I TALKED I SAID WHAT I SAID WELL WE DECIDED THAT WE'RE GOING TO STAY HERE WE'RE NOT COMING BACK
POD1000000028_S0000262	BELLA AND MARA ASKED TRUDY TO BRING BACK LUGGAGE FOR THEIR FAMILIES
POD1000000028_S0000263	AND THEN THEY JUST TOLD ME SAID WE JUST HAVE ONE REQUEST PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE THIS ROOM YOU DON'T LEAVE THIS ROOM FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES AFTER WE'RE OUT OF THIS
POD1000000028_S0000264	AND YOU CANNOT TELL ANYBODY ANYTHING UNTIL YOU GET ON THE PLANE THEY LEFT AND I LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW AND I SAW THEM THROWING THEIR LUGGAGE INTO A TAXI THEY JUMPED A TAXI AND LEFT
POD1000000028_S0000265	THAT'S WHEN I KNEW FOR SURE I SAID OH WE REALLY WE REALLY GOT RID OF THE TRACK WE'RE NOT GONNA GET BEATEN EVER AGAIN LIFE IS GONNA BE GOOD FROM NOW ON
POD1000000028_S0000266	MEANWHILE GAZE GOT HIS SECURITY GUARD ROOMMATE OUT OF THE HOTEL AND INTO THE CROWDED STREETS OF TIMES SQUARE FOR THEIR OWN SHOPPING TRIP
POD1000000028_S0000267	BIG BIG CALL I THINK WE HAD A FEELING THAT SOMETHING WAS GOING ON WE HAD SOME PLANS HE WOULD NOT LET ME GO AND SUDDENLY HE SEES LITTLE STORE WITH UMBRELLAS
POD1000000028_S0000268	GAZA HAD HIS OPPORTUNITY
POD1000000028_S0000269	I SAW A CAB YOU KNOW STOPPING DOWN THE STREET I JUMPED TO A CAB AND I WAS GONE
POD1000000028_S0000270	GAZA MADE HIS WAY TO MEET BELLA AND MARTA AT HER AUNT'S APARTMENT
POD1000000028_S0000271	AND WHEN THEY SAW ME THEY JUMPED UP AND DOWN AND I MADE IT WE'RE VERY HAPPY
POD1000000028_S0000272	AFTER TRUDY SAW THE COOLIES LEAVE SHE WENT OUT AND FOUND HER TEAMMATES ON THEIR SHOPPING EXPEDITION AND LOADED UP ON CHOCOLATE
POD1000000028_S0000273	I DID BUT CHOCOLATE AND I ATE EVEN ATE CHOCOLATE RIGHT WHEN I BOUGHT IT WAS THE TIME OF MY LIFE
POD1000000028_S0000274	THERE WAS NO ONE TO STOP HER AT NOON AS PLANNED THE ROMANIAN NATIONAL TEAM BOARDED A BUS TO THE AIRPORT
POD1000000028_S0000275	WE FINALLY GOT ON A BUS AND THE SECURITY GUY WHO WAS ALREADY GREEN ON HIS FACE WAS JUST ANGRY I SAID WHERE'S BELLA YOU KNOW IT I SAID I DON'T KNOW HOW SHOULD I KNOW MAYBE THEY DIDN'T COME BACK TO THE STORE YET I HAVE NO IDEA
POD1000000028_S0000276	THERE WAS NO SIGN OF BELLA MARTA OR GAZA
POD1000000028_S0000277	AND SO THE BUS LEFT WE GOT TO THE AIRPORT NOBELA WE GOT TO THE PLANE NOBELA
POD1000000028_S0000278	THE PLANE WAITED THREE HOURS ON THE TARMAC
POD1000000028_S0000279	I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT TO MYSELF I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT UNTIL THE PLANE TOOK OFF AND I SAW THEY'RE NOT IN THE PLANE I SAID OK NOW THEY CAN'T COME ANYMORE
POD1000000028_S0000280	IT'S BEEN SOME TIME SINCE THE UNITED STATES HAS HAD A REALLY TOP DRAWER DEFECTION FROM THE COMMUNIST BLOCK OF NATIONS BUT OVERNIGHT HERE IN WASHINGTON A TRIPLE DEFECTION BY THREE ROMANIANS BECAME KNOWN WHICH HAS OVERJOYED THE AMERICAN ATHLETIC WORLD

POD1000000030_S0000001	IF IT SAVES ENERGY AND GIVES YOUR PERFORMANCE BOOST WELL WHEN IS SHE JUST A SHOW FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA THIS IS MARKETPLACE TECH DEMYSTIFYING THE DIGITAL ECONOMY I'M JACK STUART IN FOR MOLLY WOOD
POD1000000030_S0000003	WORLD ATHLETICS THE GOVERNING BODY FOR TRACK AND FIELD IS SET TO ANNOUNCE WHETHER IT'LL BAN CERTAIN TYPES OF SHOES
POD1000000030_S0000004	IN PARTICULAR NIKE'S VAPOR FLY SHOES HAVE BEEN PROMINENTLY ON THE FEET OF ATHLETES RESPONSIBLE FOR TUMBLING RACE RECORDS RECENTLY
POD1000000030_S0000005	NIKE CLAIMS THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS SNEAKERS SHAVE UP TO FOUR PERCENT OF A RUNNER'S TIME SO IS THAT TECHNOLOGY DOPING
POD1000000030_S0000006	WE GOT A HOLD OF IAN HUNTER PROFESSOR OF EXERCISE SCIENCE AT BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY AS HE WAS WITH SOME ATHLETES TRAINING AT BUS INDOOR TRACK HE TOLD US THE SHOES WORK BY COMBINING FOAM IN THE SOUL WITH A CARBON FIBER PLATE
POD1000000030_S0000007	I THINK THE PLATE MOSTLY ALLOWS FOR SOME STRUCTURE OF THE SHOE
POD1000000030_S0000008	SO IF THAT PLATE WASN'T THERE AND YOU HAVE A FORTY FOUR MILLIMETER HEIGHT OFF THE GROUND THAT'S JUST FOAM AND YOU TRY RUNNING AROUND A CORNER IT'S JUST GOING TO COLLAPSE ON YOU
POD1000000030_S0000009	SO THAT THE PLAN
POD1000000030_S0000011	MAINLY GIVES STRUCTURE TO THE SHOE BUT IT DOES GIVE A SMALL BENEFIT IN TERMS OF ENERGY COST
POD1000000030_S0000012	COMBINE THAT WITH NOW YOU CAN DO HIGHER FOAM BECAUSE YOU CAN HOLD EVERYTHING TOGETHER WITH THE PLATE
POD1000000030_S0000013	AND YOU'VE GOT A REALLY GOOD PUSHING INTO THE GROUND BIG DISPLACEMENT OF THE FOOT WHILE IT INTERACTS WITH THE GROUND AND THEN PUSHES OFF REALLY EFFECTIVELY
POD1000000030_S0000014	SO QUITE LITERALLY PUTS A SPRING IN YOUR STEP
POD1000000030_S0000015	YEAH IT'S NOT A COILED SPRING LIKE WE'RE USED TO BUT ANY FOAM IS REALLY A SPRING THIS ONE'S JUST REALLY EFFECTIVE AT IT
POD1000000030_S0000016	BUT WHERE'S THE LINE THAT'S WHAT THE QUESTION IS NOW AND I THINK THESE ARE EITHER AT THE LINE WHERE I'D FEEL COMFORTABLE OR A LITTLE BIT BEYOND
POD1000000030_S0000017	SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT THERE COULD STILL BE SOME INNOVATION ALLOWED IN SHOES WE'RE NOT GOING TO SAY EVERYBODY MUST WEAR THE SAME TYPE OF SHOE BUT THERE MUST BE A LIMIT TO IT
POD1000000030_S0000018	YEAH I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL TO HAVE THE INNOVATION AND WHAT NIKE'S DONE HAS PROPELLED OTHER COMPANIES TO CATCH UP AND THEY WILL CATCH UP
POD1000000030_S0000019	SO WE COULD HAVE THE STANDARD FOR MARATHONING OR ROAD RACING IS A SHOW LIKE THE VAPOR FLY BUT THEN NIKE OR SOMEONE WILL GO A LITTLE FURTHER WITH IT
POD1000000030_S0000020	AND WE'LL END UP WITH LIKE SIXTY MILLIMETER FOAM AND ENOUGH CARBON FIBER TO HOLD THE STRUCTURE OF IT SO YOU'RE NOT COLLAPSING BUT IT'LL JUST CONTINUE ON
POD1000000030_S0000021	AND AT SOME POINT THE RULES NEED TO JUST STANDARDIZE HERE'S WHAT SHE IS
POD1000000030_S0000022	THE PRICE OF THESE SHOES TO US AMATEURS OUT THERE SEEMS INCREDIBLY HIGH IS IT SORT OF WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT FOR A TOP OF THE LINE RUNNING SHOE
POD1000000030_S0000023	YEAH WHEN THEY SAY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS FOR A PAIR OF SHOES THAT NIKE HAS MENTIONED PROBABLY WILL LAST YOU ABOUT NINETY MILES BEFORE IT'S LOSING SOME OF ITS EFFECTIVENESS
POD1000000030_S0000024	THAT IS GETTING TO THE POINT OF NOT OUTRAGEOUS BUT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE RESTRICTED BY THE COST OF IT AND THEY'LL BE LOOKING FOR CHEAPER OPTIONS
POD1000000030_S0000025	IF NEW BALANCE ANY OTHERS START COMPETING WITH THE SAME QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF SHU AND ARE CHARGING A HUNDRED FIFTY NIKE'S GOING TO HAVE TO START DROPPING THEIR COST DOWN
POD1000000030_S0000026	SO IT'S JUST THE NATURAL HOW MARKETING WORKS AND IT'LL ALL COME TO AN EQUILIBRIUM OVER TIME
POD1000000030_S0000027	I REMEMBER READING ABOUT THE ADVANTAGES THAT SOME FORMS OF ARTIFICIAL LEGS COULD GIVE RUNNERS POTENTIALLY OVER RUNNERS WITH LIKE NATURAL BORN LEGS I MEAN ARE WE JUST REACHING A POINT WHERE KIND OF SPORT IS HARD ENGINEERING
POD1000000030_S0000028	IT IS AND AND I THINK IT SHOULD BE BUT THEY HAVE TO BE SOME RESTRICTIONS TO HOW FAR YOU GO
POD1000000030_S0000029	WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO BE TEMPTED TO AMPUTATE THEIR LOWER LEGS SO THEY CAN GO FROM A TWO FIFTEEN MARATHON TO A TWO FIVE MARATHON
POD1000000030_S0000030	OUR LEGS AREN'T BUILT JUST FOR RUNNING THEY'RE BUILT FOR CLIMBING AND SWIMMING AND JUMPING AND ALL KINDS OF ACTIVITIES
POD1000000030_S0000031	SO IF YOU TUNE THE LAG TO BE TUNED JUST FOR RUNNING THEY'LL BE GREAT AT RUNNING BUT NOT GOOD AT OTHER THINGS
POD1000000030_S0000032	AND THAT'S WHERE YOU COULD GO IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE RULES ESTABLISHED
POD1000000030_S0000033	GIVEN THAT THESE SHOES DO KIND OF HAVE A LIMITED LIFE DO ATHLETES TRAIN IN THEM AND ACTUALLY RUNNING THEM IN RACES OR DO YOU SORT OF HOLD THEM OFF FOR THAT THAT PERFORMANCE BOOST WHEN YOU REALLY NEED IT
POD1000000030_S0000034	WELL IF THEY'RE SPONSORED BY NIKE THEY'LL DO ALL OF THEIR RACE PACE WORK IN THOSE SHOES
POD1000000030_S0000035	BUT IF THEY'RE BUYING THEIR OWN SHOES WHAT I TYPICALLY SEE IS THEY BUY THE PAIR DO MAYBE TWO WORKOUTS IN THEM BEFORE THE RACE SO THEY PROBABLY HAVE ABOUT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MILES ON THEM AND THEN THEY DO THE RACE
POD1000000030_S0000036	AND THEN THEY'LL MAYBE WORK OUT IN THOSE ONES BUT BUY A NEW PAIR BEFORE THE NEXT RACE THEY DO
POD1000000030_S0000037	AND THAT'S IF IT'S SOMEONE THAT CARES ABOUT SAVING A COUPLE MINUTES ON A MARATHON TIME
POD1000000030_S0000038	I THINK IT'S SOMEWHERE AROUND ONE OR TWO MINUTES THE BENEFIT THAT MOST WOULD GET FROM THIS SHOW
POD1000000030_S0000039	THE PRICE OF PROGRESS I GUESS IAN HUNTER THERE WHO WORKS WITH USA TRACK AND FIELD
POD1000000030_S0000041	NOW FOR SOME RELATED LINKS NIKE SHOES FIRST CAME TO PROMINENCE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WHEN THEY WERE WORN BY THE FIRST THREE FINISHERS IN THE RIO OLYMPICS MEN'S MARATHON
POD1000000030_S0000042	AN ESTIMATED NINETY FIVE OF THE FIRST ONE HUNDRED FINISHERS IN LAST YEAR'S VALENCIA MARATHON WERE WEARING VAPOR FLY SHOES
POD1000000030_S0000043	THAT'S JUST TWO OF THE STATISTICS THAT REUTERS HAS PULLED TOGETHER TO SHOW THE DOMINANCE OF THIS TECH IN VARIOUS DIFFERENT VERSIONS SOME GRAPHS IN THEIR ARTICLE TWO FOR MY FELLOW DATA NERDS
POD1000000030_S0000044	I ALSO GOT LOST IN A NEW WALL STREET JOURNAL VIDEO ON THE SHOES AND THE CONTROVERSY AROUND THEM WHICH AS IT SAYS SOME ARE CALLING A SEISMIC SHIFT
POD1000000030_S0000045	SO WE'LL LINK YOU TO THAT AND A VOICE YOU HEAR ON MARKETPLACE TECH FROM TIME TO TIME NICK THOMPSON EDITOR IN CHIEF OF WIRED MAGAZINE IS ALSO A KEEN MARATHON
POD1000000030_S0000046	AND HE SET OUT TO PUT THESE SNEAKERS TO THE TEST HIMSELF BY RUNNING THE NEW YORK MARATHON WEARING THEM AND CRUNCHING ALL OF HIS DATA
POD1000000030_S0000047	THEY FELT STRANGE AND WOBBLY AT FIRST HE SAYS MY INITIAL STEPS REMINDED ME OF PUTTING ON ICE SKATES AND THEN WALKING ON A RUBBER MAT TO THE RINK
POD1000000030_S0000048	BUT ONCE I STARTED RUNNING THE STRANGENESS DISAPPEARED AND I FORGOT I WAS WEARING THEM
POD1000000030_S0000049	MORE OF HIS EXPERIENCES AND HIS CRUNCHING OF THE SCIENTIFIC DATA TO SEE IF HE EXPERIENCED THE TECH DOPING EFFECT AT MARKETPLACE TECH DOT ORG
POD1000000030_S0000050	I'M JACK STUART AND THAT IS MARKETPLACE TECH
POD1000000030_S0000052	THIS IS APM
POD1000000031_S0000001	THE HOLIDAYS ARE OVER IT'S BACK TO REALITY FOR MOST OF US AND BACK TO SOME DISTANT WAREHOUSE FOR A LOT OF OUR UNWANTED GIFTS
POD1000000031_S0000002	FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA THIS IS MARKETPLACE TECH DEMYSTIFYING THE DIGITAL ECONOMY
POD1000000031_S0000003	I'M JACK STUART INFORMALLY WOOD
POD1000000031_S0000005	THIS SEASON'S ONLINE HOLIDAY SALES WERE WORTH SOME ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS TO RETAILERS
POD1000000031_S0000006	BUT NEARLY A THIRD OF THAT STUFF IS EXPECTED TO BE RETURNED ACCORDING TO NEW RESEARCH FROM CBRE A REAL ESTATE RESEARCH GROUP
POD1000000031_S0000007	AND THAT'S PRETTY TYPICAL THIRTY PERCENT OF ONLINE SHOPPING IS RETURNED VERSUS EIGHT PERCENT OF STUFF BOUGHT IN SHOPS
POD1000000031_S0000008	AND ALL OF THOSE RETURNS COME WITH A COST EVEN IF THEY'RE FREE TO US THE SHOPPERS
POD1000000031_S0000009	THERE'S THE EMISSIONS FROM THE TRUCKS AND PLANES THE WASTE FROM PACKAGING AND DISCARDED PRODUCTS THE COST OF FINDING SPACE FOR IT ALL OR EVEN JUST CHECKING IT OUT
POD1000000031_S0000010	DAVID BEGAN WITH CBRE SAYS RIGHT ABOUT NOW WAREHOUSE WORKERS ARE GETTING BURIED
POD1000000031_S0000011	WELL IT'S JUST THE FLOOD OF PACKAGES WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE WAY THE SUPPLY CHAIN IS BUILT AND DESIGNED IT REALLY IS MEANT TO BE AS EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE IN MOVING PRODUCT FROM THE POINT OF PRODUCTION WHERE SOMETHING IS MADE TO THE END POINT THE POINT OF CONSUMPTION
POD1000000031_S0000012	AND ALL OF THE NETWORKS YOU KNOW THE THE BUILDINGS THAT FLOW THROUGH THE BUILDINGS THE TRANSPORTATION NETWORKS EVEN THE WAY THE EMPLOYEES ARE TRAINED TO HANDLE THE PACKAGES ARE REALLY MEANT TO GET THAT STUFF MOVING OUT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE
POD1000000031_S0000013	ARE THERE WAYS THAT WE COULD USE TECHNOLOGY TO TRY TO MITIGATE THIS PROBLEM
POD1000000031_S0000014	IN MY OPINION THE REAL SOLUTION IS GOING TO BE A TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTION AT THE POINT OF SALE SO HOW DO YOU PROVIDE THE CUSTOMER BETTER ASSURANCE THAT WHAT THEY'RE BUYING IS WHAT THEY ACTUALLY WANT
POD1000000031_S0000015	SO THE CLASSIC EXAMPLE IS SOMEONE BUYS THREE OR FOUR SHIRTS WITH THE INTENTION OF ONLY KEEPING ONE OR TWO OF THEM BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW IF THE SIZE IS RIGHT THEY DON'T KNOW THE COLOR IS QUITE GONNA BE RIGHT HE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GONNA FEEL LIKE
POD1000000031_S0000016	AND I DO THINK THERE ARE TECHNOLOGIES BETWEEN AUGMENTED REALITY AND VIRTUAL REALITY WHERE WE'LL BE ABLE TO SHOP ONLINE AND HAVE MORE SENSE OF AN IN PERSON TYPE OF EXPERIENCE WHICH I BELIEVE WILL REALLY SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF RETURNS THAT OCCUR
POD1000000031_S0000017	THE OTHER SIDE OF IT THOUGH IS THAT OFFERING THAT TYPE OF FREE FRICTIONLESS SEAMLESS RETURN POLICY IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO KEEPING CUSTOMERS
POD1000000031_S0000018	DO YOU THINK WE AS CONSUMERS HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY HERE I MEAN RETURNS ARE SO EASY MOST OF THE TIME THEY'RE FREE THERE MAY BE SOMETHING WE DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT AS MUCH AS WE SHOULD
POD1000000031_S0000019	I THINK WE NEED TO INCUR SOME OF THE COST FRANKLY I DO THINK THAT THE FREE AND PAINLESS RETURN SYSTEM THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO DEALING WITH IS LONG TERM NOT SUSTAINABLE
POD1000000031_S0000020	I DO THINK AT SOME PLACE WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW DAMAGING IT IS NOT ONLY TO THE RETAILERS THAT WE'RE WE'RE DOING BUSINESS WITH BUT ALSO TO THE ENVIRONMENT
POD1000000031_S0000021	NOW ONE FACT THAT I FIND SHOCKING FRANKLY IS THAT IN THE UNITED STATES ALONE FIVE BILLION POUNDS OF RETURN MERCHANDISE GETS PUT IN THE LANDFILL EVERY SINGLE YEAR JUST IN THE US
POD1000000031_S0000022	SO MERCHANDISE THAT'S BEEN HANDLED AND ENOUGH TIME HAS PASSED BETWEEN THE POINT OF SALE TO THE RETURN POINT THAT IT'S BEEN DEEMED WORTHLESS AND IT GETS THROWN AWAY FIVE BILLION POUNDS A YEAR
POD1000000031_S0000023	SO I MEAN THAT'S JUST IT'S IT'S A DESTRUCTIVE TYPE OF TYPE OF SYSTEM THAT WE'RE ALL TAKING PART IN I THINK WE ALL NEED TO DO OUR PART TO MAKE IT GO AWAY
POD1000000031_S0000024	AND ONE OF THE WAYS TO DO THAT IS TO PAY FOR IT AND WHEN PEOPLE ARE ASKED TO PAY FOR SOMETHING THEY'LL BE A LOT MORE CAREFUL ABOUT THE WAY THEY BEHAVE
POD1000000031_S0000025	NOW THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT IS THAT THE CONSUMERS HAVE VOTED OVERWHELMINGLY IN FAVOR OF FREE AND FRICTIONLESS RETURNS AND HAVE SAID THAT THEY WILL FIND SOMEONE IF YOU DON'T GIVE IT TO ME SOMEONE ELSE WILL
POD1000000031_S0000026	SO FIXING THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY IT'S REALLY HARD TO IMAGINE THE FIRST RETAILER THAT'S GOING TO BE BRAVE ENOUGH TO TURN AROUND AND SAY SURE WE'LL TAKE YOUR RETURNS BUT IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO COST YOU
POD1000000031_S0000027	THAT WAS DAVID BEGAN WITH CBRE
POD1000000031_S0000029	AND NOW FOR SOME RELATED LINKS
POD1000000031_S0000030	IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO TALK ABOUT ONLINE SHOPPING WITHOUT MENTIONING THE BEHEMOTH THAT IS AMAZON AS ADWEEK SAYS WHERE IT GOES OTHER RETAILERS FOLLOW
POD1000000031_S0000031	AND IN THE LAST DECADE IT HAS SET NEW STANDARDS AND EXPECTATIONS FOR DELIVERY PUSHING ITS COMPETITORS TO DO THE SAME
POD1000000031_S0000032	A WEEK HAS THE FIVE WAYS WHICH AMAZON CHANGED SHOPPING IN THE TWENTY TEN S
POD1000000031_S0000033	WITH RETURNS OFTEN BEING FREE IT'S REALLY NOT SURPRISING THAT CONSUMERS AREN'T AWARE OF THE REAL COSTS
POD1000000031_S0000034	OR MAYBE WE'D JUST LIKE TO ASSUME OR HOPE THAT THOSE UNWANTED ITEMS THAT WE SO CAREFULLY RETURN WITH ALL THEIR ORIGINAL PACKAGING INTACT ARE THEN RESTOCKED AND RESOLD
POD1000000031_S0000035	THE IDEA THAT A GOOD CHUNK OF THEM END UP IN LANDFILL IS WELL AS THE LA TIMES CALLS IT A HIDDEN ENVIRONMENTAL CRISIS
POD1000000031_S0000036	DAVID EAGEN EXPLAINED THAT THE LOGISTICS OPERATION IS SET UP TO RUN SMOOTHLY IN ONE DIRECTION GETTING THINGS TO US
POD1000000031_S0000037	THERE ARE A LOT OF EFFORTS TO STREAMLINE THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TOO THOUGH THERE ARE COMPANIES MAKING IT THEIR BUSINESS TO HELP RETAILERS AND CONSUMERS
POD1000000031_S0000038	SO IF YOU DO EVER STEP OUT FROM BEHIND YOUR COMPUTER AND ACTUALLY GO TO MALLS A LITTLE MORE FREQUENTLY THAN ME YOU'VE PROBABLY NOTICED SOME RETURN BARS WHERE YOU CAN DROP OFF PURCHASES AND HAVE SOMEONE ELSE JUST DEAL WITH ALL THAT SENDING IT BACK STUFF FOR YOU
POD1000000031_S0000039	AND FOR THE SELLERS THESE COMPANIES PROMISE TO ANALYZE RETURNS AND THE REASONS FOR THEM AND REDUCE THE PACKAGING THEY NEED VOGUE BUSINESS BREAKS IT DOWN
POD1000000031_S0000040	BUT I THINK REALLY THE NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION THAT I'M TAKING AWAY FROM ALL OF THIS IS JUST TO BUY LESS STUFF I'M JACK STUART AND THAT'S MARKETPLACE TECH
POD1000000031_S0000042	THIS IS APM
POD1000000031_S0000043	HELLO TO TWENTY TWENTY AND TO ALL THE NEW MARKETPLACE INVESTORS WHO JOINED US BEFORE THE END OF THE DECADE

POD1000000032_S0000001	THE U S NEEDS A LOT MORE HOSPITAL BEDS FAST
POD1000000032_S0000002	CAN TECH HELP US BUILD THEM
POD1000000032_S0000003	FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA THIS IS MARKETPLACE TECH DEMYSTIFYING THE DIGITAL ECONOMY
POD1000000032_S0000004	I'M MOLLY WOOD
POD1000000032_S0000006	STATES AND CITIES ARE RUSHING TO FIND HOSPITAL BEDS TO PREPARE FOR AN INCREASE IN PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM COVID NINETEEN
POD1000000032_S0000007	IN NEW YORK MAKESHIFT HOSPITALS ARE GOING UP IN CENTRAL PARK A NAVY HOSPITAL SHIP IS IN THE CITY'S HARBOR
POD1000000032_S0000008	ITS JAVITS CONVENTION CENTER HAS BEEN CONVERTED INTO A TEMPORARY MEDICAL FACILITY AND THE U S ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS IS LOOKING TO CONVERT EMPTY HOTELS AND OTHER BUILDINGS INTO HOSPITALS ACROSS THE COUNTRY
POD1000000032_S0000009	NOW AS PART OF ITS RESPONSE TO THE CORONAVIRUS THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT BUILT TWO GIANT HOSPITALS IN TEN DAYS
POD1000000032_S0000010	AND WE WONDERED COULD WE BUILD HOSPITALS THAT FAST HERE IN THE U S AND WHAT TECH EXISTS TO INNOVATE ON THE CONSTRUCTION PROCESS
POD1000000032_S0000011	CHRISTINA IS WORKING ON IT HE'S THE CEO OF THE MANUFACTURING AND DESIGN FIRM BLOCK WHICH SPECIALIZES IN MODULAR MEDICAL FACILITY CONSTRUCTION
POD1000000032_S0000012	WE DELIVER ACUTE CARE FACILITIES THINK ABOUT HOSPITALS AND WE DESIGN THEM DIGITALLY AND AND WE MANUFACTURE THEM IN OUR PLANT
POD1000000032_S0000013	IMAGINE A BIG COMPLEX LEGO THAT WE CAN SHIP OUT AND THEN WHEN WE WHEN WE GET THERE WE ASSEMBLE IT AS A COMPLETED BUILDING
POD1000000032_S0000014	AND ALL OF THIS RELIES ON A BUNCH OF TECHNOLOGY THAT WE USE THE THE DIGITAL DESIGN AND THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND THE MACHINES THAT MAKE THESE PARTS REAL TOGETHER
POD1000000032_S0000015	BUT BUT AT THE END WE TAKE RAW MATERIAL AND WE TURN IT INTO HOSPITALS
POD1000000032_S0000016	AND ABOUT HOW LONG DOES THAT TAKE
POD1000000032_S0000017	TYPICAL BUILDING MAY TAKE TWELVE TO SIXTEEN MONTHS TO MAKE
POD1000000032_S0000018	AND WE DO IT IN FOUR MONTHS NOW AND EVERY DAY WE'RE YOU KNOW WE HAVE A TEAM THAT'S WORKING TO MAKE IT FASTER AND FASTER
POD1000000032_S0000019	YEAH YOU KNOW I ASKED THAT BECAUSE NO PRESSURE BUT IT SEEMS AS THOUGH WE ARE GOING TO NEED SOME HEALTHCARE FACILITIES QUICKLY
POD1000000032_S0000020	HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU SEE YOU KNOW YOUR COMPANY BEING A PART OF THAT
POD1000000032_S0000021	SO A FEW WEEKS AGO WHEN THE SIZE OF THIS PANDEMIC BECAME CLEAR
POD1000000032_S0000022	OUR TEAM HAD TO REFOCUS WE WERE MAKING PERMANENT HOSPITALS AND WE WERE DOING THEM REALLY FAST BUT WE HAD TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO TAKE THIS PROBLEM AND PUT IT THROUGH OUR MACHINE BLOCKS
POD1000000032_S0000023	AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT SO THAT WE COULD GET HOSPITAL BEDS QUICKER
POD1000000032_S0000024	WE SET OUT IMMEDIATELY TO DESIGN A TWENTY FOUR BED
POD1000000032_S0000025	
POD1000000032_S0000026	MIKE IS A MOBILE ISOLATION CARE UNIT THIS MIC IT'S GOT THREE JOBS
POD1000000032_S0000027	AND THE FIRST ONE IS IT'S GOT TO PROTECT THE FRONTLINE HEALTH CARE WORKER
POD1000000032_S0000028	AND AND THEN THERE'S THIS THE SECOND THING THAT THEY'VE GOT TO DO WHICH IS THEY THEY'RE DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE HOSPITAL'S EXISTING CAPACITY
POD1000000032_S0000029	AND THEN THE FINAL ONE IS WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE THESE MICKUS BECOME A PERMANENT AND FLEXIBLE ASSET THAT THAT HELP SERVE THE HEALTH SYSTEM GOING FORWARD
POD1000000032_S0000030	I MEAN THEY'RE INSTITUTIONAL GRADE THEY'RE REUSABLE
POD1000000032_S0000031	IT'S A FLEET OF ICE ROOMS THAT GETS TO BE MOVED IN THE FUTURE TO WHEREVER THE HOT SPOT IS
POD1000000032_S0000032	HOW MUCH DO THEY COST
POD1000000032_S0000033	THESE THINGS WILL BE AROUND TWO TO THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A BED IN THE BEGINNING AND THEN THOSE THOSE PRICES WILL DROP DOWN
POD1000000032_S0000034	SO THESE ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS EXPENSIVE BUT THEY'RE STILL HIGH TECH DEVICES THAT ARE CHOCK FULL OF EQUIPMENT AND PRESSURIZATION AND ELECTRONICS AND THEY'RE STILL PRETTY EXPENSIVE BOXES
POD1000000032_S0000035	CAN YOU TELL US AT ALL WHERE THESE PROJECTS MIGHT BE HAPPENING LIKE WHERE YOU'RE PUTTING UP THESE MICS
POD1000000032_S0000036	WELL WE'RE WE'RE NOT PUTTING THEM UP YET SO IT'S STILL IT'S STILL GOING TO PRODUCTION IN TWO WEEKS
POD1000000032_S0000037	THE FIRST ONES COULD BE IN ANY OF THE SPOTS THAT ARE NEEDED
POD1000000032_S0000038	SO OBVIOUSLY WE'VE BEEN IN PRETTY HEAVY DISCUSSIONS IN NEW YORK WE'VE BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS IN IN GEORGIA AND THERE'S A BIG THERE'S A BIG DELTA BETWEEN THOSE TWO PLACES BUT IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER TO US WHERE THEY'RE NEEDED
POD1000000032_S0000039	THEY CAN GO JUST AS EASILY TO ONE OR THE OTHER
POD1000000032_S0000040	AND THEN JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY IS IT SORT OF LIKE A MODULAR HOUSE WHERE IT'S BASICALLY SORT OF PREBUILT AND THEN IT JUST COMES ON A BIG TRUCK
POD1000000032_S0000041	YOU KNOW PARTS OF IT ARE SO LEGO ANALOGY IS REALLY PRETTY GOOD
POD1000000032_S0000042	IF YOU THINK ABOUT A LEGO KIT OR ADVANCED ONE IT HAS IT HAS DIFFERENT TYPES OF PARTS
POD1000000032_S0000043	SOME OF THEM ARE VOLUMETRIC AND SOME OF THEM ARE ARE CUSTOM PARTS AND SOME OF THEM ARE LITTLE PIECES THAT CAN BE USED IN A THOUSAND DIFFERENT DIFFERENT WAYS
POD1000000032_S0000044	AND WE ARE AGNOSTIC ABOUT IT WE THINK THAT THERE'S JUST A VALUE STREAM THAT GOES FROM RAW MATERIAL AND IT'S CONVERTED INTO A USABLE BUILDING
POD1000000032_S0000045	AND AND THE PROCESS THAT IT GOES THROUGH IS A WHOLE LOT OF DIFFERENT STAGES
POD1000000032_S0000046	WE'RE JUST TRYING TO FIND AN OPTIMAL ONE
POD1000000032_S0000047	THERE'S NOT ALWAYS RIGHT PATH BECAUSE OF AND IN FACT WE'RE USING MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO FOR REGULAR HOSPITAL RIGHT NOW
POD1000000032_S0000048	BUT WE'VE WE'VE MADE DIFFERENT CHANGES THE FOUNDATION FOR EXAMPLE IS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT ON ME
POD1000000032_S0000049	IT DOESN'T NEED ALL OF THE PERMANENCE THAT THAT ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL MAY HAVE YOU KNOW THAT HAS A FIFTY YEAR LIFESPAN
POD1000000032_S0000050	SO SO THE IDEA IS WE WE THINK OF IT AS COMPLETED PARTS BUT EVERY PART IS COMPLETED
POD1000000032_S0000051	AND IT GOES TOGETHER IN A FORM OF CHUNK
POD1000000032_S0000052	IT'S KIND OF THE WAY THEY BUILD A NEW BOEING SEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN DREAMLINER IT'S NOT MADE ON AN ASSEMBLY LINE THE WAY YOU YOU KNOW YOU THINK OF AN ASSEMBLY LINE
POD1000000032_S0000053	IT'S MADE IN CHUNKS THAT ARE MADE ALL OVER THE WORLD AND THEY'RE ALL BROUGHT TOGETHER IN CHARLESTON AND PUT TOGETHER AS AN OM IN A MATTER OF DAYS
POD1000000032_S0000054	THAT'S MORE LIKE WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH WITH BLOCKS
POD1000000032_S0000055	GOT IT WHAT MAKES THESE SPECIFIC TO MEDICAL FACILITIES
POD1000000032_S0000056	WHAT KIND OF CERTIFICATION AND TECHNOLOGY GOES INTO THAT
POD1000000032_S0000057	HOSPITALS ARE REALLY HEAVILY REGULATED
POD1000000032_S0000058	AND IF YOU IF YOU TRY AND UNDERSTAND WHICH ONES THERE ARE YOU IT'S IT'S IT'S A LONG LIST
POD1000000032_S0000059	SO WHAT I WOULD JUST SIMPLY SAY IS THESE THINGS ARE DEALING WITH LIFE SAFETY AT AN INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL THEY'RE DEALING WITH EMERGENCY POWER CRITICAL CARE OPERATION
POD1000000032_S0000060	DEALING WITH TEMPERATURE CONTROL THAT'S BASED ON AIR EXCHANGES WHICH ALLOW YOU TO EVACUATE DISEASE AND INFECTION
POD1000000032_S0000061	THEY'RE DESIGNED TO BE VISIBLE AND OPERATIONAL HIGH PERFORMANCE IF YOU WILL
POD1000000032_S0000062	SO THESE THESE NURSES AND DOCTORS ARE UNDER AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF PRESSURE
POD1000000032_S0000063	AND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS CREATE A PLACE WHICH IS SAFE FOR THEM TO WORK BUT VISUALLY CONTROLLED SO THEY CAN SEE EVERYTHING AT ONCE
POD1000000032_S0000064	AND YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT WE FOCUSED ON HOW DO WE MAKE THIS REALLY BEAUTIFUL ELEGANTLY SIMPLE OPERATIONALLY VISUALLY CONTROLLED DEVICE THAT IS TECHNOLOGICALLY EMPOWERED
POD1000000032_S0000065	AND CAN BE DEPLOYED REALLY FAST AND STILL BE DONE WITH THE STUFF THAT'S AVAILABLE TODAY NOT THE STUFF THAT WE WISH WAS AVAILABLE TODAY
POD1000000032_S0000066	YOU SAID THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO TAKE A TYPICAL CONSTRUCTION TIME FOR BUILDING FROM TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS DOWN TO FOUR MONTHS
POD1000000032_S0000067	HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO CONSTRUCT THESE MICS
POD1000000032_S0000068	SO THE THE FIRST ONE WILL ROLL OFF IN JUNE THE THE END OF MAY AND IT'LL BE OPERATIONAL A WEEK LATER
POD1000000032_S0000069	AND THEN AFTER THAT THEY'LL JUST KEEP COMING AS LONG AS THEY'RE NEEDED
POD1000000032_S0000070	SO ONCE THE LINE IS LOADED THEN THINK OF IT AS JUST A CONTINUOUS RIVER THAT KEEPS DROPPING THEM OUT
POD1000000032_S0000071	SO THERE'S ABOUT TEN LARGE MODULES IN EACH ONE OF THESE AND EVERY DAY AND A HALF ANOTHER TEN WILL BE READY TO BE SHIPPED
POD1000000032_S0000072	LET ME ASK YOU THIS IT'S CLEARLY A TECHNOLOGICAL MIRACLE IN A LOT OF WAYS
POD1000000032_S0000073	JUNE IS A LONG WAYS AWAY DO YOU WISH THAT YOU HAD STARTED GETTING CALLS SOONER
POD1000000032_S0000075	YES NECESSITY IS THE MOTHER OF INVENTION AND I THINK THAT WE'RE AS A NATION IN THE MIDST OF NECESSITY
POD1000000032_S0000076	LIKE WHAT I SEE IN TERMS OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT COMING TOGETHER TO TRY AND SOLVE HARD PROBLEMS RIGHT NOW
POD1000000032_S0000077	CHRISTINA IS CEO OF THE MODULAR MEDICAL FACILITY CONSTRUCTION FIRM BLOCKS
POD1000000032_S0000078	HE SAID THE COMPANY IS TALKING RIGHT NOW WITH A FEW STATES ABOUT BUILDING THE MICKUS HE MENTIONED
POD1000000032_S0000079	BUT SO FAR HASN'T FINALIZED ANY DEALS
POD1000000032_S0000081	AND NOW FOR SOME RELATED LINKS TO THAT POINT ABOUT WHETHER BLOCK IS ALREADY BUILDING FACILITIES
POD1000000032_S0000082	FAST COMPANY HAS A PIECE ON HOW YES WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY AND THE MODULAR CONSTRUCTION EXPERTISE TO GET BUILDINGS UP QUICKLY
POD1000000032_S0000083	BUT WE ALSO HAVE A LOT OF LOGISTICS AND RED TAPE PROBLEMS
POD1000000032_S0000084	THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS AS YOU HEARD WANTS TO CONVERT EXISTING FACILITIES
POD1000000032_S0000085	BUT FOR THE REASONS THAT GATTINA MENTIONED A HOTEL OR CONVENTION CENTER IS NOT IDEAL FOR THE JOB THOSE BUILDINGS ARE HARD TO STERILIZE
POD1000000032_S0000086	THEY NEED HVAC SYSTEMS THAT CAN PREVENT INFECTIOUS DISEASES FROM BEING PUMPED INTO EVERY ROOM AND THEY HAVE PLENTY OF OTHER MEDICAL NEEDS AS WELL
POD1000000032_S0000087	THE PIECE POINTS TO SOME MODULAR DESIGN COMPANIES THAT ARE CREATING MEDICAL PODS THAT CAN BE BUILT QUICKLY
POD1000000032_S0000088	SOME OTHERS IN ADDITION TO BLOCKS
POD1000000032_S0000089	BUT SINCE EACH CITY AND STATE HAS ITS OWN RULES AROUND CONSTRUCTION AND PERMITS AND EVEN JUST A SHORTAGE OF ACTUAL LAND TO PUT MODULES ON
POD1000000032_S0000090	IT'S A TOUGH PROBLEM TO SOLVE QUICKLY AT A TIME WHEN SPEED IS WHAT WE NEED
POD1000000032_S0000092	AND HERE'S WHAT ELSE WE'RE WATCHING IN TECH
POD1000000032_S0000093	THE WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORTS THAT NO SURPRISE THE U S IS ALREADY STARTING TO TRACK PEOPLE'S SMARTPHONE DATA TO ANALYZE MOVEMENTS AND ULTIMATELY BUILD A DATABASE THAT CAN SHOW AT A NATIONAL LEVEL
POD1000000032_S0000094	HOW WELL SOCIAL DISTANCING MEASURES ARE WORKING AND WHERE PEOPLE MIGHT BE GATHERING TOGETHER IN LARGE GROUPS SO THAT AUTHORITIES CAN BOTH CRACK DOWN AND POTENTIALLY PREDICT A FUTURE OUTBREAK
POD1000000032_S0000095	AND LOOK WE'RE GOING TO TALK A LOT MORE ABOUT THIS LATER IN THE WEEK THIS NEED FOR A DATA DRIVEN RESPONSE TO THIS OUTBREAK AND THE FACT THAT THIS IS USEFUL EXISTING DATA
POD1000000032_S0000096	AND THE FACT THAT IT IS ALSO LIKELY TO BECOME A PRIVACY INVASION AT A GRAND SCALE
POD1000000032_S0000097	TECHCRUNCH HAS A PIECE ABOUT HOW SINGAPORE IS COLLECTING DATA IN A MORE PRIVACY FRIENDLY WAY THROUGH AN APP CALLED TRACE TOGETHER
POD1000000032_S0000098	THAT'S WHAT IT IS TRYING TO DO WITH ITS APP SAFE PATHS BUT BOTH CASES RELY ON PEOPLE DOWNLOADING THE APP AND USING IT AND VOLUNTARILY REPORTING INFORMATION
POD1000000032_S0000099	IN SINGAPORE THERE IS A MORE CENTRAL AUTHORITY THAT CAN YOU KNOW MAKE PEOPLE DO THE THING
POD1000000032_S0000100	THAT'S A LOT HARDER IN THE U S AND SINCE THE DATA ALREADY EXIST IN ONE GIANT COOKIE JAR FULL OF DELICIOUS QUARANTINE BAKED COOKIES
POD1000000032_S0000101	IT'S GONNA BE REAL HARD TO CONVINCE THE COOKIE MONSTER TO FIND ANOTHER TREAT
POD1000000032_S0000102	I'M MOLLY WOOD AND THAT'S MARKETPLACE
POD1000000032_S0000104	THIS IS APM
POD1000000034_S0000000	THIS MARKETPLACE PODCAST IS SUPPORTED BY TECHNOLOGY MASS JOBS DOT COM
POD1000000034_S0000001	DO YOU HAVE BIG TECH IDEAS SOMETIMES TOO BIG TAKE THEM TO MESS THEY'RE MAKING TECH A HUGE PART OF THEIR FUTURE FROM MIRRORS TO APPS THAT GUIDE YOU THROUGH THE STORE
POD1000000034_S0000002	WANT TO MAKE IT HAPPEN CHECK OUT TECHNOLOGY MACY'S JOBS DOT COM TO JOIN MACY'S TECH TEAM START SOMETHING CHANGE EVERYTHING
POD1000000034_S0000004	AMAZON HAS BECOME A BIG PART OF THIS COVID NINETEEN LIFE AND IN MORE WAYS THAN YOU MIGHT THINK FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA THIS IS MARKETPLACE TECH DEMYSTIFYING THE DIGITAL ECONOMY
POD1000000034_S0000005	I'M KIMBERLY ADAMS INFORMALLY
POD1000000034_S0000007	AS WE CONTINUE TO DEAL WITH THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK MANY OF US ARE DOING MORE ONLINE SHOPPING AND RELYING ON AMAZON MORE THAN EVER AMAZON HAS HIRED ABOUT EIGHTY THOUSAND NEW WORKERS TO KEEP UP WITH THE DEMAND
POD1000000034_S0000008	AND FOLLOWING EMPLOYEE WALKOUTS AND PROTESTS THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THURSDAY IT WOULD START TAKING EMPLOYEES TEMPERATURES AT WORK AND PROVIDE FACE MASKS
POD1000000034_S0000009	AMAZON IN THE ERA OF COVID NINETEEN IS THE TOPIC FOR THIS WEEK'S QUALITY ASSURANCE WHERE WE TAKE A SECOND LOOK AT A BIG STORY IN THE NEWS MATT DAY COVERS AMAZON FOR BLOOMBERG
POD1000000034_S0000010	AND WE TALKED ABOUT WHETHER THE COMPANY FIT INTO THAT NOW CRUCIAL DESIGNATION OF ESSENTIAL
POD1000000034_S0000011	OBVIOUSLY A GOOD DEAL OF AMAZON IS KIND OF ESSENTIAL IN THESE TIMES YOU KNOW PARTICULARLY IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WITH MOBILITY ISSUES YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO FOR FOR HEALTH REASONS DOESN'T WANT TO EVEN TAKE THE RISK OF GOING TO GOING TO A SUPERMARKET OR BIG BOX STORE THAT REMAINS OPEN YOU KNOW YOU'RE RELIANT ON ECOMMERCE AND
POD1000000034_S0000012	YOU KNOW ON THAT REGARD IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET DRY GOODS OR HAND SANITIZER OR WIPES CHANCES ARE USING AMAZON DOT COM BUT ONE OF THE DRAWBACKS THAT WE'VE FOUND OF THIS ENVIRONMENT AT LEAST IF YOU TALK TO AMAZON'S WORKERS IS THAT THEY'RE STILL SHIPPING A LOT OF NON ESSENTIAL STUFF
POD1000000034_S0000013	AMAZON'S DIGITAL DOORS REMAIN OPEN FOR FOR BOOKS FOR YOU KNOW TOYS GAMES FOR KIND OF EVERYTHING ELSE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN SELLING ONLINE ANYWAY THEY'RE STILL SHIPPING THAT THERE'S WORKERS IN FACILITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY YOU KNOW STILL RISKING THEIR OWN HEALTH GOING INTO WORK
POD1000000034_S0000014	IN THE SERVICE OF MOVING THOSE GOODS TO YOUR DOOR TOO
POD1000000034_S0000015	WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ECOMMERCE BUT AMAZON ALSO HAS A LOT OF OTHER BUSINESSES RIGHT
POD1000000034_S0000016	RIGHT RIGHT AND THERE'S THERE'S A BUNCH OF OTHER AREAS THAT YOU KNOW THEY STAND TO TO LIKELY BENEFIT FROM THIS YOU KNOW ONE OF THEM IT DOESN'T GET TALKED ABOUT QUITE AS MUCH AS AS DELIVERY BUT AMAZON WEB SERVICES THEIR CLOUD COMPUTING GROUP WHICH YOU KNOW IS ESSENTIALLY ON DEMAND SOFTWARE OR PROCESSING POWER
POD1000000034_S0000017	YOU KNOW BUSINESSES WITH EMPLOYEES WORKING FROM HOME ARE ARE MAKING MORE USE OF THAT ANALYSTS SAY AND THEN YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE SITTING HOME WATCHING NETFLIX USING A VARIETY OF INTERNET SERVICES A LOT OF THE BACKBONES OF THOSE LIVE ON AMAZON WEB SERVICES AND SO
POD1000000034_S0000018	JUST KIND OF THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM THAT THEY STAND TO GAIN TOO FROM THIS THIS ENVIRONMENT RIGHT NOW
POD1000000034_S0000019	YOU KNOW SO MANY OF OUR CONVERSATIONS ARE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS AFTER WE COME OUT OF THIS EVEN THOUGH IT'S HARD TO EVEN ENVISION WHEN THAT IS OR WHAT THE WORLD IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE AT THAT POINT
POD1000000034_S0000020	BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT AMAZON A YEAR FROM NOW WHAT KIND OF STORIES DO YOU THINK YOU'LL BE WRITING ABOUT THIS COMPANY AND AND ITS BUSINESS
POD1000000034_S0000021	I THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE WRITING ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW THIS WAS AS CATASTROPHIC AN EVENT AS IT'S PROVING TO BE GLOBALLY THIS IS KIND OF THE THING THAT AMAZON WAS BUILT FOR YOU KNOW THEY'VE SPENT MOST THE LAST DECADE BUILDING A GIANT LOGISTICS NETWORK IN THE US AND IN PARTS OF EUROPE TO
POD1000000034_S0000022	REALLY IN AN UNPRECEDENTED WAY GET GOODS TO YOU QUICKER TO EVERY DOORSTEP THEY CAN ACCESS THEY'VE BEEN TOUTING ECOMMERCE SINCE THAT TERM WAS NEW SO I THINK IN A LOT OF WAYS THEIR COMPANY BUILT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS
POD1000000034_S0000023	IT HASN'T BEEN A GLORIOUS COUPLE OF MONTHS FOR THEM THEY'VE HAD SOME COMPLAINTS FROM WORKERS ABOUT NONESSENTIAL GOODS AND THE RATE AT WHICH THEY'VE BEEN WORKED THERE'S BEEN YOU KNOW THE USUAL CRITICISM FROM US SENATORS ABOUT GIVING WORKERS BETTER PAY
POD1000000034_S0000024	HAS BEEN AN ISSUE AT AMAZON OFF AND ON FOR A WHILE YOU KNOW BUT BUT TO A LARGE EXTENT THIS COMPANY WAS DESIGNED TO HANDLE THESE KIND OF CHALLENGES SO I THINK YOU KNOW IF THIS INDEED MEANS A SORT OF PERMANENT INCREASE IN ONLINE COMMERCE YOU KNOW AMAZON WOULD STAND STAND TO GAIN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT FROM IT
POD1000000034_S0000025	THE QUESTION IS JUST WHETHER THEY'RE ABLE TO CAPITALIZE ON THAT THE WAY THEIR BUSINESS LEADERS WOULD HOPE OR IF SOME OF THE THE PR BACKLASH RELATED TO SOME OF THESE CONTROVERSIES HAMPERS THEM
POD1000000034_S0000026	WE HAVE SEEN PROTESTS THIS WEEK BY DELIVERY WORKERS AND PEOPLE WORKING IN AMAZON'S WAREHOUSES WILL THIS HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS
POD1000000034_S0000027	THE ISSUE WITH WITH AMAZON IT'S BEEN A COMPLICATED STORY FOR A LONG TIME BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THIS CRISIS IS DOING IS SOME OF THOSE FOLKS ARE KIND OF TAKING THE OPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN A WAY THAT THEY HAVEN'T BEFORE THERE WAS A WALKOUT IN AN AMAZON WAREHOUSE JUST OUTSIDE OF DETROIT
POD1000000034_S0000028	WAS THE THIRD YOU KNOW WALK OUT IN THREE DAYS AT AN AMAZON FACILITY ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND THAT'S JUST SOMETHING YOU DON'T SEE VERY OFTEN
POD1000000034_S0000029	SO CLEARLY YOU KNOW WORKERS WHO FEEL UNDER EXTREME PRESSURE THEMSELVES THINK THAT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO MAYBE ASK THINGS OF MANAGEMENT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE DIFFICULT UNDER SORT OF BUSINESS AS USUAL CONDITIONS
POD1000000034_S0000030	BLOOMBERG'S MATT DAY AMAZON ALSO SAYS IT'S NO LONGER GOING TO SELL N NINETY FIVE MASKS AND OTHER URGENTLY NEEDED COVID NINETEEN RELATED SUPPLIES TO REGULAR CUSTOMERS

POD1000000035_S0000003	FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA THIS IS MARKETPLACE TECH DEMYSTIFYING THE DIGITAL ECONOMY I'M MOLLY WOOD
POD1000000035_S0000005	NEW JERSEY'S GOVERNOR RECENTLY WENT ON T ASKING FOR VOLUNTEERS WHO KNOW COBOL A MORE THAN SIXTY YEAR OLD COMPUTER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
POD1000000035_S0000006	THAT'S BECAUSE THE STATE'S UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT SYSTEM RUNS ON A DECADE'S OLD MAINFRAME THAT CAN'T KEEP UP WITH THE VOLUME OF REQUESTS FOR FINANCIAL HELP
POD1000000035_S0000007	AND NEW JERSEY ISN'T ALONE SEVERAL STATES NOT TO MENTION LOTS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE ALL AT THE MERCY OF THESE VERY OLD SYSTEMS RUNNING ON A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE THAT ISN'T EVEN TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS ANYMORE
POD1000000035_S0000008	JOSEPH STEINBERG IS A CYBER SECURITY CONSULTANT AND AUTHOR OF THE BOOK CYBER SECURITY FOR DUMMIES
POD1000000035_S0000009	WELL FIRST OF ALL THERE ARE MANY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT USE MAINFRAMES WITH COVAL FOR BACK END PROCESSING OF TRANSACTIONS AND BATCH PROCESSING
POD1000000035_S0000010	I THINK THEY PROBABLY HAVE THINGS IN A LOT BETTER SHAPE BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES IN HOUSE
POD1000000035_S0000011	IN SOME CASES THEY'VE REPLACED THE SYSTEMS AT GREAT EXPENSE OVER RECENT YEARS IN SOME CASES THEY'RE DOING IT NOW
POD1000000035_S0000012	AND IN SOME CASES THEY'VE MADE THE DECISION TO ACTUALLY TRAIN PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THESE SYSTEMS GOING FORWARD
POD1000000035_S0000013	BUT WHEN IT COMES TO GOVERNMENT AND I WOULD SAY PROBABLY EVEN WORSE IN THE STATE GOVERNMENTS THAN IN THE FEDERAL
POD1000000035_S0000014	YOU HAVE MANY SYSTEMS THAT SEEM TO HANG AROUND FOR A VERY LONG TIME
POD1000000035_S0000015	ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I POSED IN THE LAST WEEK IS SIMPLY IF GOD FORBID THIS PANDEMIC CONTINUED FOR SEVERAL MORE MONTHS AND ALL AMERICANS HAD TO VOTE IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION REMOTELY
POD1000000035_S0000016	
POD1000000035_S0000017	DO ALL FIFTY STATES ACTUALLY HAVE COMPUTER SYSTEMS THAT COULD ACCOMMODATE THAT VOLUME OF BALLOTS GOING OUT AND IN TO BE COUNTED PROCESSED IN A SECURE FASHION IN ANY REASONABLE TIMEFRAME
POD1000000035_S0000018	AND I'M AFRAID OF WHAT THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION MIGHT BE WE SIMPLY HAVE A LOT OF LEGACY SYSTEMS INVOLVED IN VARIOUS STATE PROCESSES AND THEY ARE NOT MEANT THEY WERE NEVER DESIGNED TO ACCOMMODATE YOU KNOW MASS LOADS THAT COULD SUDDENLY HAPPEN NOW
POD1000000035_S0000019	
POD1000000035_S0000020	AND IT'S A LOT HARDER TO SCALE THESE LEGACY SYSTEMS YOU KNOW
POD1000000035_S0000021	NEWER TECHNOLOGIES SCALE MUCH BETTER AND I'M AFRAID OF WHAT'S OUT THERE YOU KNOW AT THE STATE LEVEL
POD1000000035_S0000022	AND I'M SURE THERE'S SOME IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT YOU KNOW THESE ARE AFTER THIS PANDEMIC IS OVER IT'S REALLY GOING TO BE TIME TO TAKE A SERIOUS LOOK AT A LOT OF THESE OLDER SYSTEMS AND EVALUATE WHETHER THEY REALLY ARE RELIABLE ONLY BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T HAD TO MAKE CHANGES OR THEY'RE REALLY RELIABLE
POD1000000035_S0000023	I THINK IN MANY CASES WE'LL FIND IT'S THE FORMER
POD1000000035_S0000024	RIGHT I MEAN IT SEEMS LIKE THIS IS SORT OF AN INVISIBLE INFRASTRUCTURE PROBLEM IN AMERICA THAT IN SOME WAYS IS AS EXPENSIVE AND DIFFICULT TO FIX AS ROADS AND BRIDGES
POD1000000035_S0000025	IT'S AS EXPENSIVE AND PERHAPS IN SOME WAYS MORE DANGEROUS BECAUSE YOU DON'T NOTICE IT UNTIL THE PROBLEM HAPPENS
POD1000000035_S0000026	RIGHT YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO DESPERATELY NEED MONEY BECAUSE THEIR WORK SUDDENLY ENDED THEY PLACED AN UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIM AND THEY CAN'T GET IT PROCESSED
POD1000000035_S0000027	THAT CAN BE DANGEROUS PEOPLE COULD BE LOW ON FOOD AND OTHER SUPPLIES AND IT'S NOT LIKE THEY CAN EASILY OBTAIN THEM NOW EITHER
POD1000000035_S0000028	AND I THINK THAT'S PRECISELY THE ISSUE WITH THESE OLDER SYSTEMS
POD1000000035_S0000029	OFTEN WE ASSUME THAT THEY'RE RELIABLE UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE AND THE PROBLEM YOU KNOW HAS HIT AND AT THAT POINT YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT A TACTICAL PROBLEM HOW DO WE PROCESS THESE UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS
POD1000000035_S0000030	AND STRATEGIC PROBLEM HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THIS NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN IN THE FUTURE
POD1000000035_S0000031	YOU'RE SAYING THAT EVEN IF WE WERE ABLE TO BRING A LOT OF PROGRAMMERS OUT OF RETIREMENT THAT THESE SYSTEMS SIMPLY MAY NOT EVER BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE LOAD THAT IS BEING PUT ON THEM NOW
POD1000000035_S0000032	IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO SCALE THEM UP WITH IMPROVED HARDWARE BUT THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY EXPENSIVE NUMBER ONE
POD1000000035_S0000033	AND THEY DON'T SCALE AS SIMPLY AS MORE MODERN SYSTEMS DO SO YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT YOU'RE HIRING PROGRAMMERS OUT OF RETIREMENT AND PEOPLE DON'T LIVE FOREVER
POD1000000035_S0000034	YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE AN ENDLESS SUPPLY OF PROGRAMMERS WHO PROGRAMMED IN THE SEVENTY S IN THE WORKFORCE
POD1000000035_S0000035	AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT THESE SYSTEMS AREN'T RELIABLE THEY MAY BE VERY RELIABLE FOR WHAT THEY DO NOW
POD1000000035_S0000036	
POD1000000035_S0000037	BUT WE HAVE TO ACCEPT THE FACT THAT SYSTEMS MAY NEED TO BE CHANGED AND MAY NEED TO SCALE UP SUDDENLY AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DO IT WITH THE EXISTING TECHNOLOGY AND HUMAN RESOURCES
POD1000000035_S0000038	I MEAN I HAVE BEEN AT COMPANIES THAT REPLATFORM AND IT IS HARD AND IT'S REALLY EXPENSIVE AND WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE AT A SORT OF STATE AND NATIONAL LEVEL WHAT KIND OF INVESTMENT IN TERMS OF BOTH TECHNOLOGY AND MONEY WOULD THAT TAKE
POD1000000035_S0000039	THE THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS THERE'S ALSO A POLITICAL PROBLEM WITH THINGS LIKE THIS
POD1000000035_S0000040	YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE A STATE ELECTED OFFICIAL AND YOU HAVE TO BUDGET A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR REPLACING A SYSTEM NO USER OF THAT SYSTEM INITIALLY BENEFITS FROM IT
POD1000000035_S0000041	SO YOU NEED TO HAVE THE POLITICAL WILL WHICH I THINK AFTER THIS WE WILL TO INVEST THE MONEY BEFORE PROBLEMS HAPPEN UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU'RE INVESTING FOR THE FUTURE
POD1000000035_S0000042	WE SHOULD HAVE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE SET UP THAT IF THERE IS AN EMERGENCY IN WHICH PEOPLE ARE DYING THE GOVERNOR SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON PEOPLE NOT ON YOU KNOW TECHNICAL GLITCHES IN AN UNEMPLOYMENT SYSTEM
POD1000000035_S0000043	RIGHT THIS IS SPECULATIVE AND A VAGUELY NIGHTMARE SCENARIO BUT AT WHAT POINT DO YOU THINK COMPANIES
POD1000000035_S0000045	LIKE AN AMAZON OR MICROSOFT OR GOOGLE MIGHT APPROACH STATES AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND SAY MAYBE YOU NEED A PRIVATE SOLUTION A PRIVATIZED INFRASTRUCTURE FOR SOME OF THIS
POD1000000035_S0000047	I DON'T KNOW IF THEY ALREADY HAVE THEY MAY HAVE APPROACHED THEM YEARS AGO AND BEEN TOLD THAT THE SYSTEM IS WORKING WE HAVE NO NEED TO REPLACE IT I DON'T KNOW
POD1000000035_S0000048	BUT YOU KNOW I'M SURE THAT AFTER THIS IS ALL OVER AS THE GOVERNOR HIMSELF SAID WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A POST MORTEM
POD1000000035_S0000049	AND THEN AFTER THAT POST MORTEM THERE'S GOING TO BE EVALUATIONS OF MANY DIFFERENT OPTIONS AS TO HOW TO PROCEED AND SOME OF THOSE WILL INVOLVE UTILIZING THIRD PARTY RESOURCES POTENTIALLY
POD1000000035_S0000050	BY THE WAY YOU COULD HAVE A CLOUD THAT'S RUN BY THE GOVERNMENT IT COULD BE A PRIVATE CLOUD SYSTEM IT COULD BE THEIR OWN INFRASTRUCTURE
POD1000000035_S0000051	YOU KNOW THERE ARE MANY MANY OPTIONS BUT MOVING AWAY FROM THE COAL CODE RUNNING ON THE MAINFRAME TO A MORE MODERN PLATFORM MIGHT ALLOW FOR GREATER YOU KNOW SCALABILITY SUDDENLY IF NEEDED AS WELL AS FOR EASIER MAINTENANCE IF YOU KNOW CODE CHANGES NEED TO BE MADE
POD1000000035_S0000052	YOU KNOW YOU'RE CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO NEED TO GO BEGGING FOR PROGRAMMERS AT A PRESS CONFERENCE

POD1000000035_S0000058	IN OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE NEWS MIT TECHNOLOGY REVIEW HAS A PIECE THIS WEEK ABOUT HOW GENERALLY SPEAKING THE INTERNET IS HOLDING UP SHOCKINGLY WELL IN THE MIDST OF OUR BIG TRANSITION FROM WORK AND SCHOOL TO HOME
POD1000000035_S0000059	IT POINTS OUT THAT CLOUD SERVICE PROVIDERS AND ALSO STREAMING MEDIA AND TELECOM COMPANIES
POD1000000035_S0000060	SO THINK AMAZON OR COMCAST NETFLIX MICROSOFT GOOGLE THEY ALL PUT A LOT OF MONEY INTO NEW INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE PAST DECADE OR SO IN ORDER TO KEEP DELIVERING THEIR SERVICES
POD1000000035_S0000061	AND NOW THIS CURRENT CRISIS IS GENERATING EVEN MORE INVESTMENT
POD1000000035_S0000062	NOW IF ONLY WE COULD DO THE SAME FOR THE POWER GRID AND THE BRIDGES AND THE STATE AND COUNTY MAINFRAMES
POD1000000035_S0000064	AND HERE'S WHAT ELSE WE'RE WATCHING IN TECH A BRUTAL WEEK AT YELP
POD1000000035_S0000065	THE COMPANY THAT IS BASICALLY BUILT ON SMALL BUSINESSES IS LAYING OFF A THOUSAND PEOPLE AND FURLONG ANOTHER ELEVEN HUNDRED ACCORDING TO AXIOS
POD1000000035_S0000066	YELP'S CEO WILL TAKE NO SALARY FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR AND THE COMPANY IS CUTTING EXECUTIVE PAY BY TWENTY TO THIRTY PERCENT
POD1000000035_S0000068	ALSO ON THURSDAY MICROSOFT RELEASED A REPORT ABOUT REMOTE WORK TRENDS BASED ON DATA FROM ITS TEAM'S PRODUCT
POD1000000035_S0000069	THE COMPANY OF COURSE REPORTED A HUGE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE USING TEAMS
POD1000000035_S0000070	BUT THE REPORT HAS SOME SUPER INTERESTING DATA
POD1000000035_S0000071	FOR EXAMPLE IT NOTES THAT PEOPLE ARE USING VIDEO OBVIOUSLY AND THEIR MEETINGS A LOT MORE THAN THEY EVER DID BEFORE
POD1000000035_S0000072	A THOUSAND PERCENT MORE IN MARCH IN FACT
POD1000000035_S0000073	BUT THE US LAGS A LITTLE BIT IN TERMS OF VIDEO CALLING
POD1000000035_S0000074	IN NORWAY AND THE NETHERLANDS ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT OF CALLS INCLUDE VIDEO BUT ONLY THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT OF AMERICAN MEETINGS HAVE THE CAMERA TURNED ON
POD1000000035_S0000075	I MEAN LISTEN I'M JUST GONNA CONFESS THAT I STRAIGHT UP REFUSED TO JOIN A MEETING BY VIDEO ON THURSDAY BECAUSE I FOR ONE CAN NO LONGER STAND THE SIGHT OF MY OWN FOREHEAD

POD1000000035_S0000078	THIS IS APM
POD1000000036_S0000001	FACEBOOK USERS IN ILLINOIS COULD EACH BE IN LINE FOR A COUPLE OF HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR PRIVACY VIOLATIONS WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR THE REST OF US
POD1000000036_S0000002	FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA THIS IS MARKETPLACE TECH DEMYSTIFYING THE DIGITAL ECONOMY I'M JACK STUART INFORMALLY WOOD
POD1000000036_S0000004	ABOUT A DECADE AGO FACEBOOK STARTED AUTOMATICALLY TAGGING PEOPLE WHOSE FACES ITS ALGORITHMS HAD RECOGNIZED IN OUR UPLOADED PHOTOS AT THE TIME IT SEEMED LIKE MAGIC
POD1000000036_S0000005	BUT THIS WEEK FACEBOOK HAS AGREED TO PAY FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OVER CLAIMS THAT TOOL VIOLATED PRIVACY RIGHTS THE SETTLEMENT IS IN ILLINOIS WHICH HAS STRICT LAWS PROTECTING BIOMETRIC DATA
POD1000000036_S0000006	FACEBOOK REVEALED THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AT THE SAME TIME AS IT'S QUARTERLY FINANCIAL RESULTS THIS WEEK AND THEY BY THE WAY SHOWED THAT REVENUE WAS UP TWENTY FIVE PERCENT TO TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS AT THE END OF LAST YEAR
POD1000000036_S0000007	FOR TODAY'S QUALITY ASSURANCE WE HAVE NATASHA SINGER TECH REPORTER FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES TO EXPLAIN WHAT THIS SETTLEMENT MEANS
POD1000000036_S0000008	SO ILLINOIS HAS THE TOUGHEST BIOMETRIC PRIVACY LAW IN THE UNITED STATES THERE ARE ONLY THREE STATES THAT HAVE THESE KIND OF LAWS
POD1000000036_S0000009	AND SO BIOMETRIC PRIVACY PERTAINS TO YOUR FINGERPRINTS OR FACIAL SCANS FOR FACIAL RECOGNITION AND SO IN ILLINOIS THE LAW SAYS THAT COMPANIES CAN'T COLLECT THAT KIND OF INFORMATION LIKE FACIAL DATA FOR FACIAL RECOGNITION WITHOUT GETTING WRITTEN PERMISSION FROM SOMEONE
POD1000000036_S0000010	AND ALSO THEY CAN'T COLLECT THE DATA WITHOUT TELLING SOMEBODY HOW LONG THEY'RE GOING TO KEEP IT AND SO FACEBOOK USERS IN ILLINOIS SUED FACEBOOK SAYING THAT IT HAD COLLECTED THEIR FACIAL INFORMATION AND HAD NOT OBTAINED THEIR KIND OF AFFIRMATIVE OPT IN PERMISSION AND HAD NOT TOLD THEM HOW LONG THAT FACEBOOK WAS GOING TO KEEP IT
POD1000000036_S0000011	FACEBOOK SAYS THAT THESE CLAIMS ARE NOT TRUE BUT FACEBOOK SAID THAT IT SETTLED THIS LAWSUIT BECAUSE IT WAS GOING TO YOU KNOW DRAG ON AND TAKE UP TOO MUCH RESOURCES AND IT WAS BETTER FOR EVERYBODY AND THE STOCKHOLDERS IF THEY SETTLED THE LAWSUIT
POD1000000036_S0000012	DO YOU THINK THE SIZE OF THIS FACEBOOK SETTLEMENT MIGHT SERVE AS A WARNING TO OTHER COMPANIES WHO ARE CONSIDERING THIS SORT OF TECHNOLOGY
POD1000000036_S0000013	IT FEELS LIKE MAYBE WHEN FACEBOOK INTRODUCED THINGS LIKE FACIAL RECOGNITION THEY WERE JUST LOOKING AT FUN WAYS OF USING IT AND MAYBE SOME OF THE OTHER IMPLICATIONS ARE NOW COMING TO LIGHT
POD1000000036_S0000014	IF YOU THINK ABOUT A FACE PRINT RIGHT IT'S LIKE THE FACIAL EQUIVALENT OF YOUR FINGERPRINT AND YOU MIGHT WANT TO USE YOUR FINGERPRINT FOR FUN WAYS
POD1000000036_S0000015	BUT WE KIND OF VISCERALLY KNOW THAT YOUR FINGERPRINT HAS ALL KINDS OF IMPLICATIONS AND IT'S UNIQUE SO EVEN THE NOTION OF FACEBOOK TURNING ON FACIAL RECOGNITION BY DEFAULT FOR FUN THINGS IS PROBLEMATIC FIRST OF ALL IN ILLINOIS
POD1000000036_S0000016	BUT ALSO TO A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERNED THAT THE PROBLEM WITH FACIAL RECOGNITION IS THAT IT CAN BE USED TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE AT A DISTANCE
POD1000000036_S0000017	AND SO IT IMPLICATES YOUR ABILITY TO BE ANONYMOUS BOTH ONLINE AND IN PUBLIC
POD1000000036_S0000018	DO YOU THINK HERE'S A CHANCE WE'LL SEE COMPANIES BASICALLY DEFAULTING TO JUST NOT COLLECTING ANY DATA LIKE THIS AT THE RISK OF IT SOMEHOW BEING REGULATED IN THE FUTURE
POD1000000036_S0000019	CERTAINLY I THINK COMPANIES THAT ARE HAVING SIMILAR TECHNOLOGY AND THEY HAVE ILLINOIS USERS MUST BE THINKING ABOUT IT RIGHT BECAUSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT LIKE DOORBELL CAMPS WHICH ARE SPREADING EVERYWHERE
POD1000000036_S0000020	WELL YOUR DOORBELL CAMERA IS GOING TO TAKE IMAGES OF PEOPLE AND IT'S USED FOR FACIAL RECOGNITION RIGHT SO THAT LIKE IT CAN RECOGNIZE YOUR BABY SITTER SO THAT THEY CAN COME IN IN ILLINOIS YOU NEED CONSENT FOR STUFF LIKE THAT
POD1000000036_S0000021	AND SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR ALL KINDS OF DEVICES THAT COLLECT AMBIENT BIOMETRIC DATA I THINK WE DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER TO THAT I THINK THAT COMPANIES NOW BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE FACEBOOK SETTLEMENT ARE GOING TO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THEIR ILLINOIS PLAN IS
POD1000000036_S0000022	I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT THEY WANT TO HAVE ONE SET OF SOFTWARE FOR ILLINOIS AND ANOTHER FOR THE REST OF THE COUNTRY FIRST OF ALL YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST FROM A BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE INEFFICIENT
POD1000000036_S0000023	BUT SECOND OF ALL YOU KNOW YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY SAYING WELL YOU TURNED THAT OFF FOR ILLINOIS WHY HAVEN'T YOU TURNED IT OFF FOR US
POD1000000036_S0000024	AND SO WE'RE SEEING FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE CALIFORNIA PRIVACY LAW THAT A NUMBER OF COMPANIES MICROSOFT APPLE HAVE SAID WE'RE GOING TO HONOR THE RIGHTS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA PRIVACY LAW FOR EVERYBODY IN THE UNITED STATES
POD1000000036_S0000025	IT FEELS LIKE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THESE PRIVACY STORIES WE WE TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW THE VALUE OF YOUR PRIVACY OR THE VALUE OF YOUR DATA AND IT'S ALWAYS VERY HARD TO PUT A NUMBER ON
POD1000000036_S0000026	YOU THINK THINGS LIKE THIS ILLINOIS SETTLEMENT ARE STARTING TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION AND PUTTING A DOLLAR VALUE ON THESE THINGS
POD1000000036_S0000027	SO I THINK THE NOTION THAT THERE'S A TRADE AND YOU'RE TRADING YOUR DATA FOR YOU KNOW SERVICES AND SO YOU'RE GIVING UP SOME OF YOUR PRIVACY IS THE SILICON VALLEY FRAMING THAT YOU'RE GETTING VALUE FOR DATA
POD1000000036_S0000028	BUT WHEN WE THINK OF A TRADE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GIVING UP AND WHAT YOU'RE GETTING BUT WHEN YOU GIVE UP YOUR DATA YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW IT'S GOING TO BE USED
POD1000000036_S0000029	IT CAN BE USED PERENNIALLY FOR ALL TIME FOR ALL KINDS OF PURPOSES FOR WHICH YOU DIDN'T GIVE IT AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT IT'S NOT A TRADE IT'S NOT A FAIR TRADE AND I WOULD ALSO ARGUE THAT DATA IS NOT PROPERTY
POD1000000036_S0000030	IN EUROPE SECURITY AND PRIVACY ARE FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS AND IF WE THINK OF OTHER FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS LIKE THE RIGHT OF FREE SPEECH YOU WOULDN'T SAY I'M TRADING MY FREE SPEECH FOR FACEBOOK SERVICES
POD1000000036_S0000031	SO THIS NOTION THAT WE'RE TRADING OUR RIGHT TO PRIVACY FOR SERVICES I THINK IS JUST A PROBLEMATIC FRAMING
POD1000000036_S0000033	THE NEW YORK TIMES ACCORDING TO THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE A FEDERAL COURT JUDGE MUST APPROVE THE FACEBOOK SETTLEMENT
POD1000000036_S0000034	AND THEN MEMBERS OF THE CLASS ACTION
POD1000000036_S0000036	CLAIMS FOR PART OF THE MONEY
POD1000000036_S0000038	SOME RELATED LINKS TODAY CHECK OUT NATASHA'S STORY AT THE NEW YORK TIMES FOR MORE DETAIL ON THE SETTLEMENT AND NEXT STEPS AS WELL AS COVERAGE FROM THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE FOR MORE ON WHY ILLINOIS HAS BECOME SO IMPORTANT FOR PRIVACY LAWSUITS
POD1000000036_S0000039	AND THEN IF YOU DIDN'T READ IT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO WE SET ASIDE A GOOD FEW MINUTES TO COMPLETELY DIGEST THE NEW YORK TIMES STORY THE SECRETIVE COMPANY THAT MIGHT END PRIVACY AS WE KNOW IT IT'S ABOUT CLEARVIEW AI A LITTLE KNOWN COMPANY THAT CREATED AN APP FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO USE FACIAL RECOGNITION
POD1000000036_S0000040	AS THE ARTICLE SAYS WITHOUT PUBLIC SCRUTINY MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HAVE STARTED USING CLEARVIEW IN THE PAST YEAR AND WHILE BIG TECH COMPANIES ARE AT LEAST FACING SOME SCRUTINY FOR THEIR FACIAL RECOGNITION EFFORTS THIS COMPANY SEEMS TO HAVE FLOWN UNDER THE RADAR UNTIL NOW
POD1000000036_S0000041	WELL SO WHAT YOU MIGHT THINK I'VE DONE NOTHING WRONG WHY DOES IT MATTER IF MY FACE IS RECOGNIZED IN PUBLIC PRIVACY CAMPAIGNERS WOULD ARGUE THAT WE'RE JUST NOT AWARE YET OF EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE GIVING UP
POD1000000036_S0000042	THE NEW YORK TIMES TOOK THE FEED FROM THREE PUBLIC WEBCAMS IN NEW YORK AND PHOTOS FROM EMPLOYER WEBSITES
POD1000000036_S0000043	AND USING THAT THEY MATCH TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY FACES AS JUST ONE EXAMPLE THEY FOUND A PROFESSOR ON HIS WAY TO LUNCH WITH A JOB CANDIDATE
POD1000000036_S0000044	AS THE TIMES SAYS OUR EXPERIMENT SHOWS THAT PERSON EQUIPPED WITH JUST A FEW CAMERAS AND FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY CAN LEARN PEOPLE'S DAILY HABITS WHEN THEY ARRIVE AT THE OFFICE EACH DAY WHO THEY GET COFFEE WITH WHETHER THEY LEFT WORK EARLY
POD1000000036_S0000045	THE PROFESSOR'S REACTION WHEN HE WAS TOLD WAS OH MY GOD THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE BUT THESE DAYS IT REALLY IS EASIER AND EASIER TO BELIEVE
POD1000000036_S0000046	I'M JACK STUART AND THAT'S MARKETPLACE TECH

POD1000000037_S0000007	ESSENTIALLY PLACES WHERE KIDS CAN LEARN HOW TO CREATE SLICKER YOUTUBE VIDEOS AND CHANNELS
POD1000000037_S0000008	THE DEMAND HAS GROWN AS KIDS WANT TO EMULATE THE ONLINE STARS THEY WATCH
POD1000000037_S0000009	JULIE JARGON IS THE FAMILY AND TECH COLUMNIST AT THE WALL STREET JOURNAL AND SHE WROTE ABOUT THE TREND
POD1000000037_S0000010	SHE SAID KIDS LEARN HOW TO LIGHT SHOOT AND EDIT VIDEOS ALSO HOW TO DEVELOP THEIR PERSONAL BRANDS
POD1000000037_S0000011	THEY'RE TEACHING THEM TO CREATE THEIR OWN UNIQUE VOICE SO THAT THEY CAN STAND OUT IN THE CROWD OF YOUTUBERS AND DEVELOP ORIGINAL CONTENT
POD1000000037_S0000012	BUT YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE KIDS I TALK TO THEY JUST WANT TO SHOOT VIDEOS OF THEMSELVES PLAYING FORTNIGHT
POD1000000037_S0000013	SO THERE'S A LOT OF THAT ALREADY BUT THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF KIDS ARE INTERESTED IN DOING THEY THEY WATCH THE YOUTUBERS PLAYING VIDEO GAMES AND THEN THEY WANT TO DO IT THEMSELVES
POD1000000037_S0000014	I CAN SAY I HEAR YOUTUBE CAMP AND MY INITIAL REACTION IS GROSS
POD1000000037_S0000016	BUT I KNOW THAT'S JUST LIKE ME BEING UNINFORMED AND REACTIONARY HELP ME UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF THIS
POD1000000037_S0000017	WELL YOU KNOW I MEAN I THINK THAT'S THE REACTION ACTUALLY A LOT OF PARENTS AND THERE IS A DEBATE RAGING IN A LOT OF HOUSEHOLDS RIGHT NOW ABOUT WHETHER TO ALLOW CHILDREN TO HAVE THEIR OWN YOUTUBE CHANNELS
POD1000000037_S0000018	AND A LOT OF THE YOU KNOW THE FIRST TIME REACTION FROM PARENTS IS NO
POD1000000037_S0000019	YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT KIDS BEING EXPOSED PUBLICLY AND BEING OPEN TO BULLYING AND PREDATORS AND ALL THAT STUFF THAT WE WORRY ABOUT ON THE INTERNET
POD1000000037_S0000020	BUT A LOT OF THE PARENTS I SPOKE TO WHO ALSO SHARED THOSE CONCERNS YOU KNOW KIND OF WENT ABOUT IT THOUGHTFULLY AND SAID WELL MY KID WANTS TO DO SOMETHING THEY'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT IT HOW DO I FOSTER THAT
POD1000000037_S0000021	AND IS THERE A WAY TO LOOK AT YOUTUBE AS A MEDIUM THAT CAN BE AN OUTLET FOR THEIR CREATIVITY TO DEVELOP SKILLS THAT THEY MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO DEVELOP ON THEIR OWN AT HOME
POD1000000037_S0000022	AND ALSO HOW CAN THOSE SKILLS TRANSLATE TO OTHER LIFE EXPERIENCES
POD1000000037_S0000023	AND ALSO JUST LEARNING THE POISE AND THE COMPOSURE OF SPEAKING ON FILM AND ADDRESSING AN AUDIENCE
POD1000000037_S0000024	YOU KNOW THOSE ARE ALL GOOD THINGS FOR KIDS TO KNOW HOW TO DO
POD1000000037_S0000025	YEAH SUMMER IS IS I GUESS IT'S LIKE A BLANK CANVAS FOR KIDS TO DO WHATEVER THEY WANT OR I GUESS WHAT THEIR PARENTS WANT THEM TO LEARN
POD1000000037_S0000026	AND ARE PARENTS MORE VALUING DEVELOPING DIGITAL SKILLS THAN THEY WERE IN THE PAST
POD1000000037_S0000027	I THINK SO I THINK THERE'S A GROWING AWARENESS OF THE FACT THAT THESE KINDS OF SKILLS COULD BE USEFUL FOR FUTURE CAREERS I MEAN GAMING ALONE IS SUCH A HUGE INDUSTRY
POD1000000037_S0000028	A LOT OF KIDS GO TO CODING CAMPS TO LEARN HOW TO CODE VIDEO GAMES
POD1000000037_S0000029	SO THERE ARE A LOT OF DIGITAL SORT OF SKILLS THAT YOU KNOW OLDER GENERATION OF PARENTS DON'T HAVE AND THEY'RE SEEING THAT IT COULD BE APPLICABLE TO FUTURE CAREER CHOICES FOR THEIR CHILDREN
POD1000000037_S0000030	SOME PARENTS ARE YOU KNOW THEY'RE INCREASINGLY CONCERNED ABOUT SCREEN TIME AND LIKE SOCIAL MEDIA AND SPENDING ALL DAY VIDEO GAMING LIKE EVEN IF IT IS FOR LEARNING
POD1000000037_S0000031	SO WHAT MAKES A FAMILY MORE WARY OF TECH COMPARED TO OTHER FAMILIES THAT ARE LIKE GO FOR IT
POD1000000037_S0000032	I JUST THINK IT COMES DOWN TO AN INDIVIDUAL CHOICE AND INDIVIDUAL FEELINGS ABOUT TECHNOLOGY SOME FAMILIES JUST REALLY EMBRACE IT AND THEY DON'T WANT THEIR KIDS TO BE BEHIND
POD1000000037_S0000033	AND THEY FEEL LIKE IF THEIR KIDS AREN'T LEARNING THESE SKILLS OR AWARE OF WHAT'S GOING ON ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE INTERNET MORE BROADLY THAT THEY WILL SOMEHOW BE SOCIAL OUTCASTS OR THEY WON'T HAVE THE SKILLS TO BE COMPETITIVE IN YOU KNOW IN THE FUTURE WORKFORCE
POD1000000037_S0000034	OTHER PARENTS ARE JUST REALLY CAUTIOUS MEAN IT'S NOT WHAT WE GREW UP WITH
POD1000000037_S0000035	AND SO THEY'RE YOU KNOW YOU HEAR THE HORROR STORIES AND YOU HEAR ABOUT ONLINE BULLYING AND YOUTUBE IS A VERY PUBLIC FORUM AND PEOPLE CAN LEAVE YOU KNOW MEAN COMMENTS

POD1000000037_S0000037	THAT'S A DIFFICULT THING FOR ADULTS TO EVEN FACE THAT KIND OF CRITICISM FROM THE TROLLS AND SO PARENTS HAVE TO REALLY PREPARE THEIR KIDS FOR THAT
POD1000000037_S0000038	I MEAN THERE ARE THINGS YOU CAN DO YOU CAN MODERATE THE COMMENTS THAT ARE POSTED ON YOUTUBE YOU CAN TURN THEM OFF YOU CAN MAKE A YOUTUBE CHANNEL PRIVATE SO NO ONE CAN SEE IT
POD1000000037_S0000039	THAT SORT OF DEFEATS THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF POSTING ON YOUTUBE THOUGH BECAUSE IT'S MEANT TO BE SHARED AND YOUTUBE VIDEOS ARE MEANT TO BE COMMENTED ON SO
POD1000000037_S0000040	JUST A WHOLE NEW WORLD THAT PARENTS ARE TRYING TO NAVIGATE AND AND IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO PERSONAL CHOICE AS TO WHETHER YOU YOU WANT YOUR KIDS TO JUMP INTO THAT WORLD OR MAYBE KIND OF KEEP THEM AWAY FROM IT TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE

POD1000000041_S0000241	IS BASICALLY SAYING THAT BECOMING A COP SHOULD REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE
POD1000000041_S0000242	AND BE TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD JUST BASED ON STATISTICS ABOUT WHAT POLICE OFFICERS WITH THOSE ATTRIBUTES HOW VIOLENT THEY ARE VERSUS OTHERWISE
POD1000000041_S0000243	YEAH THE LEGISLATOR WHO'S PUTTING IT WHO'S WHO WROTE THE BILL IS REFERRING TO LIKE THIS STUDY IN TWENTY TEN THAT THAT BASICALLY SAYS THAT COLLEGE EDUCATED OFFICERS TYPICALLY TYPICALLY

POD1000000041_S0000246	NOW OKAY THAT'S GOOD THING TO IDENTIFY THAT GROUP OF PEOPLE BUT THIS IS YOU KNOW LIKE WE'RE SAYING THIS IS INCREMENTAL CHANGE WHEN WE KNOW WHAT THE REAL ISSUES ARE
POD1000000041_S0000247	BUT YOU KNOW THIS ISN'T THE ISSUE HERE AND LIKE THE REASON THIS BILL IS COMING OUT ISN'T BECAUSE WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH YOU KNOW NOT ENOUGH COPS WHO STUDIED ABROAD IN BARCELONA
POD1000000041_S0000249	WE HAVE FUCKING REAL ISSUES HERE THIS IS AN ISSUE WITHIN POLICING THAT IS ANTI BLACK ANTI POOR ANTI FUCKING EVERYTHING AND THEY'RE PROTECTED BY POWERFUL UNIONS
POD1000000041_S0000250	THAT CAN KEEP ANY KIND OF REAL MEANINGFUL LIKE LEGAL REPERCUSSIONS FROM EVER YOU KNOW GETTING CLOSE TO THEM AS WELL AS LIKE THE FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCES
POD1000000041_S0000251	VIA THESE LIKE RIDICULOUS RETIREMENT PLANS A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE WHERE IT'S LIKE DUDE YOU GET FIRED AND THEN YOU'RE FUCKING SET LIKE NO MATTER WHAT EVEN IF YOU STRAIGHT UP MURDER SOMEBODY TWICE
POD1000000041_S0000252	AND THIS IS JUST YOU KNOW THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT YOU'D WISH THE LEGISLATORS WERE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT BECAUSE THIS IS A GOOD WAY OF A LEGISLATOR BEING LIKE
POD1000000041_S0000253	WELL THIS IS THIS IS AN IMPROVEMENT YES THAT WOULD BE GREAT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW YOU JUST NEED TO BE I THINK LIKE EIGHTEEN OR HAVE EQUIV LIKE EIGHTEEN WITH AN EQUIVALENT IN A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA TO BEGIN YOUR TRAINING

POD1000000041_S0000255	AND WE JUST NEED TO LOOK AT HOW MUCH MONEY IS GOING TO THESE DEPARTMENTS AND ACTUALLY JUST HAVING THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT REINVESTING IN COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THE PERCEPTION IN LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THIS COUNTRY IS
POD1000000041_S0000256	WELL PEOPLE COMMIT CRIME BECAUSE THEY'RE BLACK RIGHT RATHER THAN SEEING THE FULL PICTURE OF HOW BLACK AND BROWN AMERICANS HAVE BEEN ABANDONED AND WE'RE MERELY JUST BRANDING THIS FAILURE OF GOVERNANCE AS CRIME

POD1000000042_S0000087	IT'S DIFFERENT HERE'S THE THING MAN IT'S ANYBODY CAN BE ANYBODY IN TODAY'S SOCIETY CAN BE FAMOUS OVERNIGHT
POD1000000042_S0000088	IF THEY GET THE RIGHT AVENUE RIGHT LIKE DAVID GOGGANS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE GOING ON ROGAN MAN I DIDN'T KNOW WHO THAT WAS
POD1000000042_S0000089	UNTIL HE WENT ON JOE ROGAN JACO I WASN'T FAMILIAR WITH BECAUSE I'M A NON MILITARY GUY RIGHT I'M A CIVILIAN BUT HE GOES ON ROGAN AND CRUSHES AND YOU'RE LIKE ALRIGHT GREAT IT DEPENDS ON THE OPPORTUNITIES AND WHERE YOU ARE
POD1000000042_S0000090	AND THEN YOU'RE MESSAGING AFTER IT ON TOP OF IT NOW CLEARLY WHAT YOU'RE WRITING ABOUT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR TODAY'S WORLD AND HELPING GETTING JOBS WHEN YOU COME OUT
POD1000000042_S0000091	AND MAYBE THIS SHOW WILL BE THE PLATFORM FOR YOU FOR YOU AS A PERSON WHY WAS THIS SO IMPORTANT TO WRITE
POD1000000042_S0000093	YOU KNOW FUNDAMENTALLY THE STRONGEST FORCE IN THIS NATION IS OUR ECONOMY AND PEOPLE DON'T TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY YOU KNOW IT IS OUR DUTY AS AMERICAN CITIZENS TO MAKE SURE THAT THING IS AS STRONG AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE WHEN IT IS WE HAVE EVERYTHING WE NEED IN THE MILITARY
POD1000000042_S0000094	AND FOR A VET COMING OUT IF YOU CAN'T FIND PURPOSE YOU KNOW SO MANY VETS NOWADAYS SAY HEY YOU KNOW YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW MY WHY I DON'T KNOW MY PURPOSE YEAH YOU'VE GOT ONE PURPOSE GET A JOB MAKE THE ECONOMY STRONGER
POD1000000042_S0000095	AND THAT'S YOUR DUTY TO THE NEXT GENERATION OF MILITARY LEADERS COMING IN
POD1000000042_S0000097	AND WHY DO YOU THINK IT'S SO HARD TO GET THROUGH PEOPLE'S HEADS OF WHY THEY SHOULD HIRE MILITARY VETERANS LIKE THIS IS ONE THAT I WILL NEVER UNDER
POD1000000042_S0000098	THERE'S A LOT OF MISCONCEPTIONS OUT THERE MAN HONESTLY I MEAN IT'S IT'S HOW DO YOU TRANSLATE INTANGIBLE SKILLS INTO TANGIBLE SKILLS WHEN WE ALL KNOW FROM PEOPLE THAT HAVE DEVELOPED IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE A SPORTS COACH OR A LEADER IN THE MILITARY
POD1000000042_S0000100	YOU KNOW THAT SOMEONE'S RESUME IS FAR LESS IMPORTANT THAN THEIR ABILITY TO FUCKING CHANGE ON THE FLY RIGHT TO ABSORB INFORMATION MAKE QUICK DECISIONS AND THEN TURN THAT INFORMATION INTO GOOD DECISIONS
POD1000000042_S0000101	WHAT I MEAN THAT'S YOU CAN'T YOU CAN TEACH PEOPLE TO DO IT IT'S NOT TRUE THAT YOU CAN'T TEACH PEOPLE BUT PEOPLE THAT CAN DO IT UNDER EXTREME DURESS ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN AND THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE YOU WANT AND THOSE LIKE HIGH LEVEL POSITIONS
POD1000000042_S0000102	YES OR AN EVEN LOWER LEVEL POSITIONS LIKE I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT AS WELL LIKE I GOT MY FIRST TASTE OF IT ON RANGE FIFTEEN WHEN I DIRECTED THAT THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME WHERE MOST OF THE PEOPLE BEHIND THE CAMERA WERE VETERANS RIGHT
POD1000000042_S0000103	THEY DIDN'T HAVE AS MUCH EXPERIENCE AS IS TYPICAL PEOPLE IN HOLLYWOOD BUT THE WORK ETHIC THEY OUTWORKED ANY OF THOSE LAZY ASSHOLE LIKE THREE TO ONE AND AFTER THAT I MEAN MY MIND COMPLETELY CHANGED WHERE I WAS JUST LIKE DUDE
POD1000000042_S0000104	IF YOU'RE NOT HIRING MILITARY VETERANS TO DO ALL THE SHIT LIKE YOU'RE MISSING OUT ON I MEAN BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING YOU DON'T HAVE TO TEACH THEM YOU DON'T HAVE TO TEACH THEM WORK WORK ETHIC WHATSOEVER OR WHAT IT'S LIKE TO GET UP EARLY AND WORK HARD STUFF LIKE
POD1000000042_S0000105	THAT'S ALREADY INSTILLED IN EVERYBODY THAT COMES OUT OF THE MILITARY AS A CIVILIAN MY GOD MAN THAT'S THE FIRST FUCKING PEOPLE I WOULD HIRE OVER ANY OF THESE FUCKING ASSHOLES IT WAS LIKE
POD1000000042_S0000106	MY DAD DID THIS OR DO THIS OR WHATEVER AND IT'S LIKE WELL WELL GREAT HOW WAS I GONNA HELP MY COMPANY YOU KNOW
POD1000000042_S0000107	SO THE BOOK IS NOT EXACTLY YOU KNOW AN ARGUMENT FOR WHY YOU SHOULD HIRE VETERANS BUT AS A WHOLE IT SPEAKS TO YOU HIRE FOR CHARACTER YOU HIRE FOR ATTITUDE YOU HIRE FOR MINDSET
POD1000000042_S0000108	INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE WHICH IS HOW NINETY NINE PERCENT OF COMPANIES HIRE IS NOT A PREDICTOR OF SUCCESS IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE SOMEBODY HAS FIVE YEARS OF MARKETING YOU KNOW EXPERIENCE DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE GOOD AT MARKETING
POD1000000042_S0000109	IF YOU FIND SOMEBODY WITH ALL THE RIGHT ATTRIBUTES AND YOU TRAIN THEM LIKE YOU JUST SAID YEAH THEY WILL OUTWORK THEY WILL OUTPACE THOSE PEOPLE EVENTUALLY AND IT'S FRUSTRATING YOU KNOW THE SYSTEMIC CHALLENGES WITH VETERANS YOU KNOW WHERE CIVILIANS GET THIS
POD1000000042_S0000110	BECAUSE LET'S BE HONEST YOU KNOW COMING OUT OF WORLD WAR TWO PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE SERVED IN THE MILITARY FOR THE MOST PART YEAH AND THEY HAD THEY UNDER
POD1000000042_S0000111	I HAD TO
POD1000000042_S0000112	THEY UNDERSTOOD THE VALUE OF VETERANS IT'S NOW THE ONE PERCENT VERSUS THE NINETY NINE PERCENT
POD1000000042_S0000113	I MEAN IT'S IT'S POINT FOUR FIVE PERCENT ACTUALLY WANT TO BE SPECIFIC YEAH I THINK I THINK IN WORLD WAR TWO WAS LIKE FIFTEEN POINT EIGHT PERCENT TO NOW POINT FOUR FIVE PERCENT YEAH
POD1000000042_S0000115	
POD1000000042_S0000116	IT'S A DIFFERENT WORLD NOW OBVIOUSLY
POD1000000042_S0000117	THE NINETY NINE POINT FIVE PERCENT THEIR PERCEPTIONS ARE BASED OFF WHAT THEY SEE IN THE MOVIES HOLLYWOOD IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE THE BEST RECRUITING TOOL FOR THE MILITARY IT'S ALSO ITS WORST ENEMY WHEN YOU GET OUT
POD1000000042_S0000118	THAT'S WHY SHOWS LIKE SEAL TEAM ARE SO IMPORTANT LIKE THEY GET IT ALL RIGHT THEY DON'T CHURCH UP ANY OF THE BULLSHIT AND IT'S SOME IT'S ONE THING TO BE TO CHALLENGE SOME OF THOSE ISSUES AND TAKE THEM ON IN A NETWORK ENVIRONMENT IS TOUGH WHEN YOU'RE MURDERING PEOPLE BASICALLY
POD1000000042_S0000119	BUT THEY GET THEY GET A LOT RIGHT AND ALL THOSE GUYS ARE HUGE SUPPORTERS OF THE MILITARY AS WELL THAT'S WHY THEY GOT INTO THE PROGRAM IN THE FIRST PLACE TYLER LIKE IS YOU KNOW TYLER
POD1000000042_S0000120	TELEGRAPH
POD1000000042_S0000121	HE'S HE'S A FUCKING MAGNET HE IS A MAGNET FOR GOOD AND TALENTED PEOPLE I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS ABOUT HIM THAT MAKES THAT HAPPEN MAYBE HE'S JESUS IT'S HARD TO SAY
POD1000000042_S0000123	IT SEEMS LIKE PEOPLE FIRST OF ALL HE'S ONE OF THE HARDEST WORKING HUMAN BEINGS I'VE EVER MET IN MY LIFE BUT HE'S ALSO BRILLIANT AND AN OPERATOR SO IT'S
POD1000000042_S0000124	PEOPLE FLOCK TO HIM TO BE ABLE TO EXPRESS SHIT LIKE THAT AND I TALKED TO PEOPLE I'VE BEEN ON SET A COUPLE TIMES I TALKED TO THE PEOPLE THAT WORK ON THAT SHOW THAT'S BEEN IN HOLLYWOOD FOR YEARS AND THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT VETS THE SAME WAY THAT OTHER PEOPLE OUT THERE DO
POD1000000042_S0000125	THERE'S THERE'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT THE WAY THEY SPEAK AND YOU CAN TELL THAT IT'S JUST EXPERIENCE RIGHT
POD1000000042_S0000126	LIKE THAT'S ALL IT IS IT'S EXPERIENCE ONE ON ONE WITH A HUMAN BEING IT'S THE REASON NOBODY HATES GAY PEOPLE ANYMORE EVERYBODY WAS AFRAID OF GAY PEOPLE FIFTEEN YEARS AGO AND THEY'RE LIKE OH EVERYBODY'S GAY COOL YEAH NO ONE CARES NOW NO ONE CARES ANYMORE AND THERE'S SOME RETICENCE
POD1000000042_S0000127	ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO DEAL WITH WITH VETERANS JUST TO DEAL WITH THEM IN GENERAL RIGHT AND WE'RE ALSO REALLY BAD AT ASKING FOR HELP WHEN WE NEED IT TO
POD1000000042_S0000128	SO ALL THESE THINGS COME TOGETHER AND THE THE RESULT UNFORTUNATELY VERY OFTEN IS SOME DUDE ALONE IN HIS APARTMENT WITH A FUCKING GUN IN HIS HAND YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN THAT'S TOO COMMON STANDARD HERE AND IT'S IT IS WHAT IT IS I MEAN WE HAVE TO EDUCATE
POD1000000042_S0000129	AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT'S WHAT THIS BOOK DOES
POD1000000042_S0000130	WE WERE LUCKY TO HAVE SERVED IN A TRIBE REALLY SOME OF THE LAST TRIBES THAT EXIST IN THE US AND WHEN YOU LEAVE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE ALL YOU KNEW WAS TEAM AND PRICOR
POD1000000042_S0000131	IT'S HARD TO COME BACK ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU SEE THE LEADERSHIP IN THE NATIONAL CAPITAL REGION WHERE WE EXPECT OUR LEADERSHIP TO BE THE BEST AND WE GET THE EXACT OPPOSITE AND THEY CAN'T EVEN WORK WITH YOU KNOW TOGETHER WITH SOME CIVILITY
POD1000000042_S0000132	AND YOU COME BACK FROM A MILITARY ENVIRONMENT AND YOU'RE LIKE WHAT THE HELL IS GOING
POD1000000042_S0000133	VERY DISAPPOINTING WE'VE GOT THE BEST MILITARY THAT YOU COULD POSSIBLY HAVE WE HAVE THE BEST IDEA THE BEST FUNDAMENTAL IDEA THAT ANY COUNTRY IS BASED ON
POD1000000042_S0000134	AND I THINK IT'S TWO PARTS ONE IS INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY AND THE OTHER PART IS WHAT SAID YOU HAVE TWO HANDS FOR A REASON ONE TO PULL YOURSELF UP AND ONE TO PULL THE NEXT GUY UP WITH YOU
POD1000000042_S0000135	THOSE ARE THE TWO FUNDAMENTAL FUNDAMENTAL GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF MOST AMERICANS LIVES I HOPE BUT SOMEHOW WE END UP EVERY SINGLE YEAR WITH THE SHITTIEST POSSIBLE LEADERS LIKE WHAT WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT AMERICAN CULTURE THAT WE'RE NOT ABLE TO PUT PEOPLE
POD1000000042_S0000137	I THINK MAYBE THE PRESUMPTION THAT EVERYBODY'S ON THE SAME PAGE IS A DANGEROUS PRESUMPTION BECAUSE CLEARLY THERE'S A LOT OF FUCKING SNAKES OUT THERE AND WE'VE WE'VE PUT THAT PART OF OUR BRAIN ON HOLD BECAUSE OUR LIVES ARE BUSY
POD1000000042_S0000138	BUT IT MIGHT BE TIME TO START PAYING A LITTLE BIT OF ATTENTION TO WHAT'S GOING ON IN POLITICS AGAIN NOT JUST FUCKING RESHARING STUPID SHIT ON FACEBOOK BUT ACTUALLY PAY ATTENTION TO WHO'S SAYING WHAT HOW FULL OF SHIT BOTH OF THESE PARTIES ARE
POD1000000042_S0000139	AND HOW THEY'RE BASICALLY JUST FUCKING USING YOU TO GET WHAT THEY WANT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO FUCKING TURN INWARD AND START LOOKING AT THEMSELVES AND HOW THEY'VE ALLOWED THIS SHIT TO HAPPEN BECAUSE WE HAVE TO PREVENT IT FROM CONTINUING WE HAVE TO STOP IT IN ITS TRACKS
POD1000000042_S0000140	WE HAVE TO PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN AS WELL LIKE WE'RE NOT LEARNING A LOT OF LESSONS RIGHT NOW EVERYBODY'S
POD1000000042_S0000142	IT'S FUCKING STUPID
POD1000000042_S0000143	IF YOU DON'T TAKE AN INTEREST IN POLITICS POLITICS WILL ASSUREDLY TAKE AN INTEREST IN YOU YEAH AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE NOW SEEING THAT AND THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT DON'T GET OUT AND VOTE IS I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT TO SAY DISGUSTING
POD1000000042_S0000144	BUT YOU KNOW THAT IS YOUR CIVIC DUTY TO GET OUT THERE AND VOTE AND YOU KNOW I THINK PEOPLE ARE GOING TO WAKE UP AND THEY'RE GONNA START GETTING A LOT MORE INVOLVED

POD1000000042_S0000538	THERE IS NO GOOD SOLUTION
POD1000000042_S0000539	BUT I DON'T KNOW THERE IS I DISAGREE THERE IS A GOOD SOLUTION WITH BIG TECH IF I GO BUY A GUN A GUN HAS TO BE REGISTERED TO SOMEBODY'S NAME
POD1000000042_S0000540	
POD1000000042_S0000541	IT HAS TO BE
POD1000000042_S0000542	
POD1000000042_S0000543	RIGHT SO IF I'M GONNA GO AND CREATE AN ACCOUNT ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND USE THIS PLATFORM THAT CAN BE USED TO TO TO EMOTIONALLY CHARGE PEOPLE AND TO TO TO MASS YOU KNOW GATHER PEOPLE TO DO SOMETHING FOR A CAUSE
POD1000000042_S0000544	THAT SHOULD HAVE TO BE REGISTERED TO SOMEBODY'S NAME BECAUSE WHY IS THAT GUN REGISTERED TO SOMEBODY'S NAME TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE
POD1000000042_S0000545	WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING IS BASICALLY THE WAY TELEPHONES WORK WHICH IS A PUBLIC UTILITY THING AND IT MAKES SENSE PEOPLE HEAR THE WORD REGISTER AND THAT DOES NOT SIT WELL WITH
POD1000000042_S0000546	OKAY SO IT
POD1000000042_S0000547	BECAUSE HOW MUCH HOW MUCH POWER DO WE WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO HAVE WE NOT DO WE NOT WANT THE CAPABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER ANONYMOUSLY OVER THE INTERNET WE HAVE TO HAVE
POD1000000042_S0000548	NOT WHAT I'M SAYING THOUGH THAT'S NOT THAT IS NOT WHAT I'M SAYING I'M NOT SAYING THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO BE THE ONE
POD1000000042_S0000549	RIGHT BUT WHO WOULD IT BE
POD1000000042_S0000550	YOU KNOW WHAT IF BIG TECH IF I'M GOING TO CREATE A PLATFORM AND AND IT'S GONNA BE MY PLATFORM THEN IF IF THIS ACCOUNT BREAKS THE LAW

POD1000000042_S0000552	
POD1000000042_S0000553	RIGHT SO THE SAME THING SHOULD BE WITH THE SAME SHIT IS LIKE A TEXT MESSAGES IT SHOULD BE THE SAME THING WITH SOCIAL MEDIA SITES THAT IF SOMETHING IS SAID THAT BREAKS THE LAW THERE SHOULD BE NO CENSORSHIP DECIDED FROM A PRIVATE PARTY
POD1000000042_S0000554	IF THIS ACCOUNT BREAKS THE LAW THEN GUESS WHAT I COME TO YOU AS YOUR BIG TECH ALL YOU ARE IS A VAULT HAS VERIFIED THESE PEOPLE THAT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS FAR AS IT GOES TO CENSORSHIP
POD1000000042_S0000555	AND I COME TO YOU AND SAY WHO IS THIS ACCOUNT REGISTERED TO AND THEN THAT PERSON IS HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR BREAKING THE LAW
POD1000000042_S0000556	SO INSTEAD OF WHAT SECTION TWO THIRTY DOES WHICH IS BASICALLY ABSOLVE PEOPLE OR ABSOLVED TECH COMPANIES OF ANY ILLEGAL ACTIVITY OUTSIDE OF THEIR PURVIEW THAT MAY HAVE HAPPENED ON THEIR PLATFORM
POD1000000042_S0000557	YOU WOULD RECOMMEND SOMETHING LIKE THE TECH COMPANIES JUST BEING COMPLICIT OR COMPLIANT RATHER WITH THE GOVERNMENT PROSECUTING CASE I UNDERSTAND THAT IN PRINCIPLE
POD1000000042_S0000558	ABSOLUTELY
POD1000000042_S0000559	BUT IMAGINE A GOVERNMENT WHERE C IS IN CHARGE AND SHE'S MAKING LISTS OF PEOPLE WHO SUPPORTED TRUMP

POD1000000042_S0000566	I THINK I THINK MORE THE BIGGER PROBLEM TO ALL THIS IS IS THAT THE FACT THAT HONESTLY THIS PRESIDENT'S NOT GONNA CHANGE MY THREE LIVES HERE THIS PRESIDENT'S NOT GONNA MAKE ANY DECISIONS THAT'S GONNA AFFECT MY LIFE OR CHANGE WHAT I DO EVERY SINGLE DAY
POD1000000042_S0000567	IT'S GONNA HAVE ABSOLUTELY I DON'T INVEST IN STOCKS SO I DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT THAT I'LL BET I'LL GAMBLE ON MY OWN MONEY I'LL GO AND I'LL INVEST IT IN PROPERTY OR I'LL DO IT LIKE THAT SO THAT'S GONNA BE ON MY PERFORMANCE

POD1000000042_S0000579	
POD1000000042_S0000580	THAT AFFECTS MY LIFE

POD1000000042_S0000582	I MEAN THE
POD1000000042_S0000583	NOT THAT THEY HAVE THE CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY TO DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT SURE THE FACT THAT THEY'RE EVEN TALKING ABOUT IT AND YEAH I MEAN

POD1000000043_S0000032	ALL RIGHT LET'S GET TO THE NEWS LESS THAN A YEAR AFTER THE FIRST DOCUMENTED CORONAVIRUS INFECTION IN THE UNITED STATES THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION JUST AUTHORIZED PFIZER'S COVID NINETEEN VACCINE FOR EMERGENCY USE
POD1000000043_S0000033	AND THE INITIAL INJECTIONS HAVE BEGUN TODAY MARKING THE LAUNCH OF THE LARGEST VACCINATION EFFORT IN AMERICAN HISTORY
POD1000000043_S0000034	THE DOSES WILL BE DISTRIBUTED BASED ON EACH STATE'S ADULT POPULATION AND THE STATES THEMSELVES WILL DECIDE WHO GETS VACCINATED FIRST WITH FRONTLINE HEALTH CARE WORKERS EXPECTED TO BE AT THE FRONT OF THE LINE
POD1000000043_S0000035	THE FIRST SHIPMENT OF THREE MILLION DOSES ENOUGH TO INOCULATE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE WERE FLOWN OUT OF GRAND RAPIDS MICHIGAN ON SUNDAY AFTER BEING TRANSPORTED FROM ONE OF FISHER'S NEARBY FACILITIES
POD1000000043_S0000036	AND HERE'S A CLIP OF THE CROWD GATHERED TO WATCH THE VACCINE LEAVE THE WAREHOUSE
POD1000000043_S0000038	JUST NICE TO SEE A GROUP OF PEOPLE CHEERING SCIENCE AND NOT TRYING TO BURN SCIENTISTS AT THE STAKE
POD1000000043_S0000040	THAT CLIP WASN'T ANYTHING SPECIAL FOR LISTENERS IT COULD HAVE BEEN ANY CROWD BUT LIKE IT'S IT'S NOT OFTEN WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO TALK ABOUT GOOD NEWS HERE ESPECIALLY IN TWENTY TWENTY ON POD SAVE AMERICA
POD1000000043_S0000041	SO THOUGHT WE'D PLAY THAT CLIP LOVE YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THE SCOPE AND SPEED OF THIS SCIENTIFIC ACHIEVEMENT AND HOW IT CAME TO BE
POD1000000043_S0000043	YEAH YOU KNOW THERE'S I ACTUALLY REALLY RECOMMEND THERE WAS A DEEP DEEP DIVE IN THE WASHINGTON POST
POD1000000043_S0000044	THAT WAS I THINK PRETTY FAIR IN LOOKING AT THE ACHIEVEMENT OPERATION WARP SPEED TRUMP'S IMPACT HIS NEGATIVE IMPACT AND
POD1000000043_S0000046	INSIDE OF THAT PIECE AND I DON'T WANT TO JUST MAKE IT ABOUT TRUMP BUT I DO THINK THAT THERE'S SOMETHING IMPORTANT IN IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW INSIDE OF THAT PIECE WHICH IS REALLY ABOUT LIKE
POD1000000043_S0000048	THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE REALLY IS AND IT'S BORN OF AN INCREDIBLE FOCUS OVER THE LAST YEAR IT'S BORN OF DECADES OF INVESTMENT IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND BASIC RESEARCH IN
POD1000000043_S0000049	IN SYSTEMS THAT TRY TO PREVENT THE INFLUENCE OF POLITICS OF YOU KNOW CORPORATE INFLUENCE AND INTERFERENCE ON SCIENCE THE BUILDING OF PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE OF TRUST IN INSTITUTIONS LIKE ALL OF THAT
POD1000000043_S0000050	BUT THEN THERE'S THIS
POD1000000043_S0000052	ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL IN THE PIECE AND THEY'RE QUOTED AS SAYING SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF IN TWENTY YEARS PEOPLE WON'T REMEMBER BLEACH THEY WON'T REMEMBER HIM NOT WEARING MASKS THEY WON'T REMEMBER THIS THEY'LL JUST REMEMBER OPERATION WARP SPEED
POD1000000043_S0000053	AND I SAW THAT AND I WAS LIKE OH OK YOU KNOW WISHING IS NOT GOING TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN AND WHAT WAS STRIKING TO ME IN SEEING THE TRUCKS
POD1000000043_S0000055	IT WAS BITTER SWEET TO ME I WAS WATCHING THE VIDEOS ON REPEAT
POD1000000043_S0000056	BECAUSE WHAT ELSE AM I GONNA DO AND WHAT I WAS THINKING WHEN I SAW IT IS
POD1000000043_S0000058	LOOK AT THIS INCREDIBLE ACHIEVEMENT THAT LIKE THESE SCIENTISTS AND AND GOVERNMENT WERE ABLE TO DO TOGETHER IT TOOK EVERYTHING THAT TRUMP HATES IT TOOK DISCIPLINE IT TOOK BELIEF IN INSTITUTIONS IT TOOK NOT ALLOWING POLITICAL INTERFERENCE IT TOOK PUBLIC
POD1000000043_S0000060	MATH SCIENCE
POD1000000043_S0000061	AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS HUMAN INGENUITY HUMAN CREATIVITY HUMAN DISCIPLINE IT WAS ENOUGH TO OVERCOME THE VIRUS AND THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY BUT IT WASN'T ENOUGH TO OVERCOME TRUMP IT WASN'T ENOUGH OVERCOME THE FAILURE OF LEADERSHIP
POD1000000043_S0000062	THE FAILURE TO GIVE PEOPLE RESOURCES TO SURVIVE THE FAILURE TO HAVE ENOUGH MASKS THE FAILURE TO MODEL BEST PRACTICES THE FAILURE TO MODEL GOOD BEHAVIOR THE FAILURE TO CELEBRATE THE PEOPLE THAT WERE DOING THE RIGHT THING THE FAILURE TO HELP THE PEOPLE THAT WERE DOING THE RIGHT THING
POD1000000043_S0000063	BECAUSE THERE WAS NO REASON THAT THIS VACCINE WOULD COME AT A TIME IN WHICH THE VIRUS WAS COMPLETELY UNCHECKED IN THIS COUNTRY AND THAT IS TRUMP'S GREAT FAILURE
POD1000000043_S0000064	AND IT IS A TRIBUTE TO EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO WAS INVOLVED IN MAKING THIS VACCINE HAPPEN THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO OVERCOME THE ABSENCE OF LEADERSHIP
POD1000000043_S0000065	THAT HAS BEEN BASICALLY THE ONLY CONSISTENT THING TRUMP HAS OFFERED UP AND UNTIL HIM PRETENDING TO BE A LEADER BY BADGERING OFFICIALS TO MAKE THE VACCINE ROLL OUT FASTER JUST BEFORE IT IS APPROVED
POD1000000043_S0000066	SO THAT HE COULD CLAIM SOME CREDIT AND GET HIMSELF IN THE NEWS CYCLE IT ENDS AS IT BEGAN
POD1000000043_S0000067	TELL ME WHAT DO YOU THINK DO YOU THINK WE'LL STILL REMEMBER THE BLEACH IN TWENTY
POD1000000043_S0000069	THE IDEA THAT ANY OF THESE PEOPLE CAN PREDICT WHAT WE WILL OR WON'T REMEMBER IN TWENTY I FEEL LIKE IN TWENTY YEARS OUR KIDS ARE GONNA BE LIKE WAIT YOU GUYS COULD HAVE PUT KLEENEX ON YOUR FACE AND NOT HAD THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE DIED AND YOU CHOSE NOT TO WHAT'S WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU LIKE YOU KNOW ANYWAY
POD1000000043_S0000070	THAT IDIOT IS AN IDIOT ON A PERSONAL LEVEL I JUST FEEL LIKE IT HAS BEEN LIKE REALLY NICE FOR ALL OF OUR MENTAL HEALTH TO WAKE UP AND READ THESE STORIES AND SEE THESE PHOTOS RIGHT I MEAN HANNA AND I CANCELED OUR PLANS TO SEE HER FAMILY AROUND THANKSGIVING
POD1000000043_S0000071	WE'RE STAYING IN LA OVER CHRISTMAS INSTEAD OF GOING TO SEE MY MOM AND MY SISTER AND MY BROTHER IN BOSTON AND IT SUCKS RIGHT I MEAN HOLIDAYS ARE A BIG DEAL TO US THEY ARE TO EVERYBODY BUT YOU KNOW FINALLY THERE'S THERE'S LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL HERE
POD1000000043_S0000072	AND YOU KNOW TO LEVI'S POINT I MEAN THIS VACCINE IS A MIRACLE NINETY FIVE PERCENT EFFECTIVE AND CREATED IN RECORD TIME I MEAN WE ARE SO SO LUCKY THAT IS SO MUCH FASTER THAN ANYTHING IN HISTORY
POD1000000043_S0000073	IT IS WAY MORE EFFECTIVE THAN YOUR STANDARD FLU VACCINE SO THIS IS A MIRACLE AND AND WE SHOULD BE CLEAR THE PFIZER VACCINE WAS DEVELOPED BY A GERMAN COUPLE
POD1000000043_S0000074	RIGHT ONE OF THEM WAS BORN IN TURKEY AND EMIGRATED TO GERMANY WHEN HE WAS FOUR THE OTHER IS THE DAUGHTER OF TURKISH IMMIGRANTS TO GERMANY SO FOR ALL OF TRUMP'S CREDIT GRAB WE HAVE GERMANS AND IMMIGRANTS TO THANK FOR THIS FISER VACCINE
POD1000000043_S0000075	THE THE OPERATION WARP SPEED FOLKS DESERVE SOME CREDIT FOR BUYING A HUNDRED MILLION DOSES OF THE PFIZER VACCINE THEY DESERVE OUR ETERNAL HATRED AND SHAME FOR PASSING ON UP TO FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOSES AT NO COST TO THE U S I MEAN WE COULD HAVE JUST LIKE PAID WHEN WE GOT IT RIGHT
POD1000000043_S0000076	BUT YOU KNOW IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY SCIENTIFIC FEAT THERE'S SOME REALLY INTERESTING RESEARCH ABOUT HOW IN THE FUTURE WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO SPEED UP THIS PROCESS EVEN MORE AND WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PRE PREPARED VACCINES FOR ALMOST ALL THE MAJOR KNOWN VIRUSES OUT THERE
POD1000000043_S0000077	WE COULD MAYBE CREATE A VACCINE FOR FIFTY TO A HUNDRED OF THE MOST YOU KNOW SORT OF DANGEROUS PROMINENT VIRUSES FOR THE COST OF THE F THIRTY FIVE FIGHTER JET PROGRAM SO THAT SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY GOOD DEAL COMPARED TO A PLANE WE MAY OR MAY NOT NEED TO USE
POD1000000043_S0000078	LOTS OF GOOD NEWS TODAY YOU KNOW FEELING REALLY GOOD ABOUT THIS AND YOU KNOW IT WAS NICE TO SEE PEOPLE FEELING LESS SCARED BASICALLY
POD1000000043_S0000079	SO I JUST REMEMBER IN APRIL WHEN THIS STARTED DR FAUCI SAID TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS FOR A VACCINE HOPEFULLY
POD1000000043_S0000080	AND THERE WERE A BUNCH OF EPIDEMIOLOGISTS SCIENTISTS AND OTHERS SAYING THAT FAUCI'S TIMELINE WAS WAY TOO OPTIMISTIC FOR TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS ELEVEN MONTHS THAT'S WHAT THIS VACCINE CAME IN ELEVEN MONTHS
POD1000000043_S0000081	THE SHORTEST TIMELINE PREVIOUSLY FOR ANY VACCINE EVER WAS THE MUMPS VACCINE WHICH TOOK FOUR YEARS THAT WAS THE RECORD AND WE'VE GONE FROM FOUR YEARS TO ELEVEN MONTHS AND LIKE YOU KNOW TOMMY YOU JUST MENTIONED ABOUT THE NINETY FIVE PERCENT EFFECTIVE
POD1000000043_S0000082	FDA WAS READY TO APPROVE A VACCINE THAT WAS OVER FIFTY PERCENT EFFECTIVE NOT LIKE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT EXPECTED NINETY FIVE PERCENT EFFECTIVE I MEAN THIS IS IT TRULY IS A MIRACLE
POD1000000043_S0000083	THERE THERE WERE HEADLINES BACK IN THE SPRING SAYING LIKE WE MAY NEVER GET A VACCINE SO NOW I HAVE THE SAME KIND OF YOU KNOW HOPE AND OPTIMISM
POD1000000043_S0000084	THIS SECTION IS JOHN BASICALLY BEING SO MAD AT LIKE A SERIES OF ARTICLES IN THE ATLANTIC THAT WERE SO ANNOYING OVER THE COURSE OF MANY IT WAS LIKE THE DOOM AND GLOOM PUBLICATION OF CHOICE FOR SEVERAL MONTHS
POD1000000043_S0000085	I'VE BEEN I'VE BEEN HOLDING BACK ON
POD1000000043_S0000087	THE ATLANTIC HAS SOME OF LIKE THE BEST JOURNALISTS IN THE WORLD AND WRITE SOME OF THE BEST FUCKING STUFF IN THE WORLD BUT THE NUMBER OF DOOMSDAY YOU CAN JUST GOOGLE THEM THE NUMBER OF DOOMSDAY HEADLINES THAT FUCKING PUBLICATION ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO LIVE FOREVER WITH THIS AND NEVER GO BE THE SAME IS RIDICULOUS
POD1000000043_S0000088	BUT ANYWAY
POD1000000043_S0000090	NO SO I WAS I WAS LIKE I WAS VERY HOPEFUL AND OPTIMISTIC TO AND KIND OF WHAT YOU WERE SAYING
POD1000000043_S0000092	LIKE IT
POD1000000043_S0000093	IT REALLY SPEAKS TO THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW OUR WORLD IS POLITICS AND WE TALK SO MUCH ABOUT POLITICS WE'RE ALL OBSESSED WITH POLITICS AND POLITICS IS REALLY BROKEN AND THE BROKENNESS OF POLITICS HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEATH AND DISASTER THAT HAS COME FROM THIS PANDEMIC
POD1000000043_S0000094	BUT OTHER PARTS OF SOCIETY ARE NOT BROKEN SCIENCE IS NOT BROKEN LIKE THIS WAS A FEAT OF SCIENCE AND JUST LIKE A MODERN MIRACLE THAT THAT WE SHOULD CELEBRATE
POD1000000043_S0000095	EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW POLITICS FAILED US
POD1000000043_S0000097	EVERY OTHER WAY EVERY OTHER WAY
POD1000000043_S0000098	ALSO JUST SAY TOO THAT LIKE FAUCI SAID BASICALLY THAT HE WAS GOING TO SEE THIS VACCINE TO THE END
POD1000000043_S0000099	AND THAT THE COMPROMISES HE WAS MAKING YOU KNOW BEING INSIDE OF THIS ADMINISTRATION YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT PEOPLE SAYING THEY WERE COMPROMISING YOU KNOW NOT TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT TRUMP FOR THEIR OWN POLITICAL GAIN
POD1000000043_S0000100	FAILING TO MAKE ANY HEADWAY FAILING TO ACTUALLY STAND UP TO TRUMP DOING THE MORALLY REPREHENSIBLE AND EASY THING BUT LIKE HERE'S THIS GUY FAUCI WHO I THINK LIKE WE WILL LOOK BACK AND SAY LIKE DID AN EXTRAORDINARY THING OF SERVING HIS COUNTRY
POD1000000043_S0000101	DESPITE THE HEADWINDS THAT WERE PRESENTED BY HIS BOSS DESPITE THE INCREDIBLE OBSTACLES SET UP BY DONALD TRUMP TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS CAME TO AN END AND LIKE HE'S A REAL YOU KNOW HE'S A HERO
POD1000000043_S0000103	SO TRUMP DID PUBLICLY PRESSURE THE FDA TO SPEED UP THE APPROVAL PROCESS FROM SATURDAY TO FRIDAY AND HIS CHIEF OF STAFF REPORTEDLY THREATENED TO FIRE FDA COMMISSIONER STEPHEN HAHN IF THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN YOU GUYS SEE ANY PROBLEMS WITH THAT
POD1000000043_S0000104	I MEAN YEAH LOOK FIRST LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS ISSUE OF CREDIT FOR A MINUTE BECAUSE THERE'S THERE'S A DEBATE GOING ON TO BUT LIKE
POD1000000043_S0000105	WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PFIZER VACCINE THE US DESERVES CREDIT FOR MAKING AN ADVANCED PURCHASE OF THAT VACCINE IN JULY THEY GOT A HUNDRED MILLION DOSES
POD1000000043_S0000106	I ALREADY MENTIONED HOW ANGRY I AM THAT THEY DIDN'T ADVANCE PURCHASE SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLIONS MORE DOSES BUT WHATEVER
POD1000000043_S0000107	BUT THE THING THAT'S INCREDIBLE AGAIN ABOUT THE MODERNA VACCINE IS THAT THAT VACCINE WAS DESIGNED JANUARY THIRTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY WE'VE HAD THIS VACCINE FORMULA IN OUR HANDS FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR
POD1000000043_S0000108	BECAUSE A VERY BRAVE CHINESE DOCTOR SEQUENCED THE GENOME AND PUBLICIZED IT AND THESE ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY THAT NONE OF US ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND BUT IT ALLOWED US TO PULL THIS OFF SO QUICKLY AND NOW THE PROBLEM BECOMES LOGISTICS
POD1000000043_S0000109	BUT I MEAN IN TERMS OF LIKE THREATENING THE FDA CHIEF I MEAN THERE'S A HUGE PROBLEM WITH THAT I MEAN EVEN THE TERM OPERATION WARP SPEED IS HORRIBLY PROBLEMATIC IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT FROM A MEDICAL POINT OF
POD1000000043_S0000110	WE KNOW TRUMP WANTS CREDIT FOR THE VACCINE BEING DEVELOPED QUICKLY BUT THIS ISN'T FAST FOOD LIKE NO ONE IS REALLY PUMPED ABOUT LIKE A RUSHED MEDICAL PRODUCT RIGHT LIKE NO ONE'S GETTING THE THE FASTEST CREATED TYLENOL EVER
POD1000000043_S0000112	A BAD IDEA TO TALK ABOUT THIS AND TO TALK ABOUT IT AS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED QUICKLY RUSHED MANNER AND SO GOING EVEN FURTHER TO POLITICIZE THE APPROVAL PROCESS IS A BAD IDEA
POD1000000043_S0000113	WHEN YOU'VE GOT LIKE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THERE'S SOME SUBSETS OF THE ANTI VAXXER COMMUNITY THAT ARE KIND OF SUPER AGGRESSIVE AND DANGEROUS AND SPREAD MISINFORMATION
POD1000000043_S0000114	THEN THERE'S OTHER PEOPLE ESPECIALLY IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY WHO HAVE READ ABOUT THE TUSKEGEE SYPHILIS STUDY AND HAVE SOME UNDERSTANDABLE HESITATION BASED ON THAT HISTORY ABOUT A NEW DRUG
POD1000000043_S0000115	THIS IS GOING TO REQUIRE A SERIOUS SCIENCE BASED PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY WHO DESPERATELY WANT A VACCINE BUT CAN'T HAVE
POD1000000043_S0000116	RIGHT LIKE IF YOU'RE GETTING CHEMOTHERAPY YOU CAN'T GET THE VACCINE IF YOU'RE UNDER SIXTEEN AS OF RIGHT NOW YOU CAN'T TAKE THE VACCINE IT'S NOT CLEAR WHEN IT'S GOING TO BE APPROVED FOR PREGNANT WOMEN
POD1000000043_S0000117	AND SO IF THE VIRUS IS SWIRLING AROUND THE COUNTRY BECAUSE A BUNCH OF VACCINE ELIGIBLE PEOPLE JUST REFUSE TO TAKE IT THAT'LL PUT OTHERS AT RISK
POD1000000043_S0000118	AND SO THAT'S WHY YOU KNOW IT'S JUST IT'S HORRIBLE THAT WE HAVE TO READ THESE STORIES OVER AND OVER AGAIN OF TRUMP JUST POLITICIZING THE PROCESS WHEN IF HE HAD JUST SHUT UP AND STEPPED BACK AND LET THE PROCESS WORK THINGS WOULD BE BETTER
POD1000000043_S0000119	FACT FIZER DIDN'T TAKE OPERATION WARP SPEED MONEY BECAUSE THEY WERE WORRIED THAT THE GOVERNMENT MIGHT SLOW THEM DOWN
POD1000000043_S0000121	I MEAN LIKE TRUMP IS THE WORST OFFENDER HERE BUT IT IS GOING TO BE A MAJOR CHALLENGE TO GET THE PUBLIC COMMUNICATION AROUND THIS CORRECT YOU KNOW EVEN FOR THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WHO'S GOING TO APPROACH IT IN GOOD FAITH YOU KNOW
POD1000000043_S0000122	EVEN YOU KNOW THE FDA APPROVAL PROCESS YOU KNOW IT WASN'T IT WASN'T UNANIMOUS DECISION AND SOME PEOPLE WERE LIKE WHY DID SOME MEMBERS OF THE PANEL VOTE AGAINST IT WELL IT TURNS OUT THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED AGAINST IT WERE JUST SAYING OH I DON'T THINK IT'S READY FOR SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN YEARS
POD1000000043_S0000124	TO SPECIFIC AGES BUT IT'S LIKE THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT YOU ACTUALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE YOU COMMUNICATE CLEARLY TO PEOPLE BECAUSE IF YOU JUST SEE A NUMBER OH SOME PEOPLE VOTED AGAINST IT YOU THINK IT'S DANGEROUS IT'S NOT IT'S JUST THEY HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE AGES SO FAR YOU KNOW
POD1000000043_S0000125	SO THERE IS GOING TO BE LIKE THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS TOO MUCH PUBLIC COMMUNICATION AROUND THIS VACCINATION EFFORT AND IT REALLY HAS TO BE CONSISTENT AND DONE VERY WELL
POD1000000043_S0000126	WELL I MEAN LOOK THERE WAS SOMETHING SUCH A TO ME WAS SUCH LIKE A SIGNAL EXAMPLE OF WHAT TRUMP HAS DONE THROUGHOUT THIS PERIOD BECAUSE YEAH HE WAS COMPLAINING THAT OH THEY HELD BACK THE SAYING THAT THE VACCINE WORK
POD1000000043_S0000127	BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT TO HELP ME IN MY ELECTION RIGHT THAT WAS JUST IN THE PAST COUPLE WEEKS BUT THIS WAS LIKE
POD1000000043_S0000129	HE KNEW THE APPROVAL WAS GOING TO HAPPEN IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM HE WASN'T GOING TO SPEED IT UP HE WASN'T REALLY GOING TO SLOW IT DOWN THE VACCINE WAS GOING TO BE DELIVERED ON MONDAY
POD1000000043_S0000130	SO HE LIKE HECTORED AND HECTORED AND HECTORED TO ACHIEVE SOME MADE UP RESULTS SO THAT HE COULD LOOK LIKE A TV PRESIDENT
POD1000000043_S0000132	THE OTHER PIECE OF THIS TOO IS THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPENED THAT HASN'T HAPPENED RIGHT LIKE
POD1000000043_S0000133	THERE SHOULD BE A PUBLIC CAMPAIGN GOING ON RIGHT NOW THAT DOESN'T EXIST ABOUT HOW THE VACCINE IS GOING TO BE DISTRIBUTED WHERE IT'S GOING TO GO LIKE THERE'S ALL THE ASPECTS OF PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP THAT HAVE JUST BEEN COMPLETELY MISSING
POD1000000043_S0000134	IT'S WHY THERE AREN'T ENOUGH N NINETY FIVE MASKS RIGHT NOW IT'S WHY THERE'S THERE THERE MAYBE SUPPLY PROBLEMS DOWN THE LINE WITH A VACCINE AND IT'S WHY RIGHT NOW WE DON'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE WILL GET IT
POD1000000043_S0000135	WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S GOING TO GO WE DON'T KNOW THE PROCESS BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN NO PUBLIC EDUCATION AND SOME OF THIS HASN'T EVEN BEEN FULLY THOUGHT OUT

POD1000000043_S0000199	WHAT ARE SOME OF THE BIGGER CHALLENGES IN GETTING EVERY AMERICAN INOCULATED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE YOU KNOW WE'VE ALREADY COVERED SORT OF THE DEMAND SIDE OF IT WHICH IS MAKING SURE THAT ENOUGH PEOPLE WANT IT AND TRUST IT BUT WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHER OTHER ISSUES INVOLVED IN THIS TOM
POD1000000043_S0000200	I MEAN I THINK IT'S THIS IS NOW JUST A MASSIVE LOGISTICAL ISSUE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION TWO HUNDRED MILLION FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOSES IF EVERYBODY NEEDS TWO OF THEM ALL OF THOSE DOSES NEED TO BE CONTAINED IN A LITTLE VIAL
POD1000000043_S0000201	THEY ALL NEED TO BE MANUFACTURED AND THEY ALL NEED TO BE SHIPPED SOMEWHERE AND THEY ALL NEED TO BE DOLED OUT BY STATES THAT ARE REALLY SHORT ON CASH AND SO IT REALLY IS LIKE THANK GOD JOE BIDEN AND HIS TEAM ARE COMING IN BECAUSE IT REALLY IS JUST ABOUT COMPETENCY
POD1000000043_S0000202	AND SO THAT'S WHERE YOU KNOW AGAIN I FEEL A LITTLE HOPE MORE HOPEFUL I MEAN I FEEL HOPEFUL IN A LOT OF WAYS WITH JOE BIDEN AND NOT TRUMP BUT IT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD ALL FEEL HOPEFUL ABOUT THAT MAYBE WE CAN SPEED UP THESE TIMELINES
POD1000000043_S0000203	I GUESS THE THING I DON'T UNDERSTAND AND LOOK I'M TOTALLY OUT OF MY DEPTH HERE IS WHY THE U S GOVERNMENT ISN'T USING THE DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT TO MAYBE AID IN MANUFACTURING OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE OF THE VACCINE
POD1000000043_S0000204	NOT SAYING THAT THEY SHOULD DO WHAT TRUMP SEEMS TO BE ATTEMPTING TO DO WITH HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER WHICH IS USE THE DPA OR USE THE GOVERNMENT TO SAY HEY FIZER ALL YOUR DOSES ARE FOR US THEY'RE NOT FOR OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE THAT'S IMMORAL
POD1000000043_S0000205	AND IT'S NOT FEASIBLE BECAUSE THEY MANUFACTURE A LOT OF THESE DOSES OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY TOO BUT LIKE AT A MINIMUM WE COULD USE THE DPA TO RAMP UP PRODUCTION OF PPE
POD1000000043_S0000206	OR WE COULD USE MILITARY ASSETS TO TO SHIP SOME OF THESE VACCINES ESPECIALLY THE ONES THAT NEED TO BE STORED AT SUPER COLD TEMPERATURES WE COULD RAMP UP THE AVAILABILITY AND FREQUENCY OF TESTING
POD1000000043_S0000207	TO DO A BETTER JOB OF IDENTIFYING OUTBREAKS I DO THINK LIKE THE THING WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT WAS THE BROKEN MESSAGING AND CLARITY ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND WHAT'S GOING TO EXPECT AND THE BIDEN TEAM WILL FIX THAT
POD1000000043_S0000208	ALONG THOSE LINES I MEAN I THINK ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THAT YOU KNOW THE MEDIA COULD DO IS COMMIT TO NOT REPORTING ON OR AMPLIFYING TRUMP'S COVID RELATED LIES OR MISINFORMATION
POD1000000043_S0000209	STARTING THE DAY HE LEAVES OFFICE YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN HE IS LIKE THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IN TERMS OF VACCINE HESITATION RIGHT NOW AND WE SHOULD ALL AGREE THAT WE'RE MOVING ON FROM THIS ASSHOLE IF YOU'RE NOT YOU KNOW A FOX NEWS HOST
POD1000000043_S0000210	I START TO GET THE SENSE THAT THE DPA IS LIKE AND IT'S TOUGH TO FIGURE THIS OUT NOW BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HERE AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS GOING TO DO BUT IT'S ALMOST LIKE A LAST RESORT THING THAT YOU USE
POD1000000043_S0000211	IF ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PRIVATE COMPANIES AREN'T COOPERATING AND DOING WHAT YOU WANT THEM TO DO FAST ENOUGH AND OF COURSE IT'S LIKE THERE'S A WHOLE SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUE RIGHT SO THE SUPPLY OF THE VACCINE
POD1000000043_S0000212	BUT THERE'S GLASS VIALS SYRINGES NEEDLES COOLING SYSTEMS ULTRA COLD FREEZERS GPS THERMAL SENSORS I MEAN IF YOU READ SOME OF THESE STORIES ABOUT WHAT THEY HAVE TO GET THIS VACCINE AROUND IT'S INCREDIBLE AND IT'S LIKE SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST NEEDING ENOUGH ACTUAL VACCINE
POD1000000043_S0000213	THE COORDINATION AND LOGISTICS ARE JUST LIKE MIND BOGGLING ALSO DELIVERING THEM RIGHT LIKE YOU NEED THE FIRST BATCH OF VACCINES ARE GOING TO HOSPITALS THAT CAN HANDLE ULTRA COLD STORAGE WHICH IS NOT EVERY HOSPITAL
POD1000000043_S0000214	TRUCKS THAT CAN HANDLE ULTRA COLD STORAGE WHICH IS CERTAINLY NOT EVERY TRUCK
POD1000000043_S0000215	AND THEN YOU HAVE THE ISSUE WHERE IT'S LIKE GOING TO BE HARDER TO REACH RURAL AND UNDERSERVED AREAS THAT JUST DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT HEALTH CARE CAPACITY HOW DO YOU GET IT TO THEM WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TRUCKS AND HOSPITALS THERE LIKE IT IS A IT'S A BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HAS QUITE A CHALLENGE
POD1000000043_S0000216	WE NEED THE MODERNA APPROVAL TO COME THROUGH BECAUSE THAT CAN BE STORED AT MORE REGULAR TEMPERATURES AND THAT WILL THINK HELP
POD1000000043_S0000217	FOR SURE
POD1000000043_S0000218	AND I DO SORT OF WISH ASTRAZENECA HADN'T JUST TOLD DOCTORS TO KIND OF YOU KNOW GIVE GIVE PEOPLE TWO OR THREE FINGERS WORTH KNOW WHAT I MEAN
POD1000000043_S0000220	TWO FINGERS FOR MOST PEOPLE THREE FINGERS IF YOU'RE LIKE YOU'RE YOU KNOW REALLY THIRSTY FOR THE VACCINE
POD1000000043_S0000222	BECAUSE NOT GREAT NOT GREAT AND I WONDER WHAT'S GOING ON WITH JOHNSON AND JOHNSON COME ON JOHNSON AND JOHNSON BUT
POD1000000043_S0000223	TOMMY TOMMY YOU'VE SAID THIS A COUPLE TIMES BUT WE REALLY SHOULD HIT ON IT LIKE THIS FUCKING THE FACT THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION COULD HAVE BOUGHT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION MORE DOSES FROM FIZER
POD1000000043_S0000224	HAD THIS WAS A NEW YORK TIMES STORY A COUPLE WEEKS AGO HAVE THE CHANCE IN JULY AND THEN I DIDN'T REALIZE UNTIL I SAW SCOTT GOTTLIEB THE FORMER FDA COMMISSIONER WAS ON CNBC THIS MORNING SAYING
POD1000000043_S0000225	AS AS LATE AS NOVEMBER THIS NOVEMBER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAD ANOTHER CHANCE TO BUY ANOTHER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOSES AND DIDN'T AND WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHY LIKE KEEP LOOKING FOR LIKE
POD1000000043_S0000226	ARE WE JUST IS THIS HYPERBOLE ARE WE LIKE NO NO NO THERE'S NO EXPLANATION ANYWHERE AS FAR AS I CAN TELL OF WHY THEY PASSED UP IN NOVEMBER THE CHANCE TO BUY ANOTHER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOSES
POD1000000043_S0000227	I GET THAT THEY'RE HEDGING THEIR BETS AND BUYING FROM A BUNCH OF COMPANIES BUT AGAIN LIKE
POD1000000043_S0000228	
POD1000000043_S0000229	IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS FIRST OF ALL I THINK WE HAD TO MAKE THE PAYMENT UPON RECEIPT OF THE DOSES SO IF WE DIDN'T GET THEM FROM FIZER WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY THE MONEY BUT IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS SPENDING ANOTHER EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS ON VACCINE DOSES IS NOTHING
POD1000000043_S0000230	NOTHING COMPARED TO THE COST IN LIVES IN OUR ECONOMY AND EVERYTHING ELSE IT IS IT IS BAFFLING IT IS ABSOLUTELY MIND BOGGLING IT IS BAFFLING I DON'T GET HOW THIS HAPPENED THIS IS A FUCK UP OF JUST EPIC PROPORTIONS
POD1000000043_S0000231	AND I DON'T KNOW HOPEFULLY WE'LL FIGURE OUT WHO DID IT I BET THE EMAIL WAS LIKE UNOPENED IN JARED'S INBOX SOMEWHERE WITH ONE OF HIS YOU KNOW HIS COLLEGE ROOMMATES YOU KNOW TOLD HIM NOT TO DO IT OR SOMETHING
POD1000000043_S0000232	YEAH I'VE BEEN LOOKING TOO IT'S LIKE THERE'S REALLY IS YOU CAN'T FIND ANY PLAUSIBLE EXPLANATION BECAUSE IT WAS NOT THE MONEY WAS NO RISK THERE WAS NO RISK
POD1000000043_S0000234	IF IT WORKED
POD1000000043_S0000235	AND I WAS LIKE I WAS LIKE ARE THEY WERE THEY WERE THEY WORRIED ABOUT GETTING THE SUPER COLD VERSION WHERE THEY WERE ALSO COUNTING ON MODERNA ASTRAZENECA JOHNSON JOHNSON IS THERE ANY EXPLANATION SO FAR THERE'S BEEN NO EXPLANATION
POD1000000043_S0000236	
POD1000000043_S0000237	CRAZY YOU TOUCH ON THIS BUT YOU KNOW EXPERTS SAY THAT IT'S GOING TO COST ABOUT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE STATES TO DISTRIBUTE ALL THIS AND IT'S NOT JUST ITS DISTRIBUTION IT'S STORING THE VACCINE HIRING MEDICAL WORKERS RUNNING PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PICKS UP SOME OF THE TABS BUT A LOT OF THIS IS ON THE STATES
POD1000000043_S0000238	AND OF COURSE STATES DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY LEFT BECAUSE OF THIS RECESSION AND THEY HAVE BEEN BEGGING FOR LOCAL AND STATE AID FOR MONTHS THAT MITCH MCCONNELL IS HOLDING UP SINGLE HANDEDLY FACT HE'S HOLDING UP THE ENTIRE COVID RELIEF BILL OVER THIS
POD1000000043_S0000239	BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT STATES TO GET A PENNY OF ADDITIONAL MONEY IT IT DOES SEEM TO ME LIKE DEMOCRATS SHOULD JUST HAMMER THIS ISSUE RELENTLESSLY AND LIKE TURN THE STATE AND LOCAL AID ISSUE INTO AN ISSUE ABOUT VACCINE DISTRIBUTION FOR STATES
POD1000000043_S0000240	YEAH I MEAN JUST BEFORE WE WERE RECORDING IT LOOKED LIKE SOME OF THE NEGOTIATORS WERE PUTTING OUT KIND OF TWO VERSIONS RIGHT THEY WERE GOING TO PUT OUT THE VERSION OF THE BILL THAT WAS JUST THE RELIEF PORTION AND THEY WERE GOING TO SEPARATE OUT
POD1000000043_S0000241	THE STATE AID AND THE LIABILITY PORTION
POD1000000043_S0000242	BECAUSE THEY PROBABLY KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT GOING TO PASS AND THEY'RE LIKE ALRIGHT WE'LL JUST FUCKING SET THAT LOOSE
POD1000000043_S0000243	WELL IT DOES SEEM LIKE IF WE IF WE REALLY ARE SEPARATING OUT LIABILITY AND STATE AND LOCAL AID IT DOES SEEM TO DOOM LIABILITY PROTECTION AND STATE AND LOCAL AID BECAUSE MITCH MCCONNELL WON'T BUDGE ON STATE ON STATE AND LOCAL AID DEMOCRATS OBVIOUSLY DON'T WANT LIABILITY PROTECTION
POD1000000043_S0000244	I DON'T CARE WHAT WHAT THAT NEGOTIATION LOOKS LIKE IT'S IT'S A MADDENING THING YOU KNOW I TALKED TO SCOTT ABOUT IT IN LOVE LEVIT AND IT REALLY
POD1000000043_S0000245	IT'S IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING THIS IS TAKING A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF PROTECTING PEOPLE AND HELPING PEOPLE DURING THIS CRISIS AND ADDING A COMPLETELY UNRELATED THING OF OF IMMUNIZING CORPORATIONS
POD1000000043_S0000246	WHICH DOES NOTHING TO HELP US GET OUT OF THIS CRISIS BUT IT DOES SEEM AS THOUGH SEPARATING THOSE THINGS OUT MAKES BOTH FAR LESS LIKELY TO HAPPEN WHILE MAKING YOU KNOW DIRECT PAYMENTS MAYBE MORE PLAUSIBLE I DON'T KNOW
POD1000000043_S0000247	I JUST ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DRIVES ME THE MOST INSANE ABOUT WASHINGTON IS THAT IT'S ALL ABOUT EXPECTATIONS MANAGEMENT WHEN IN TERMS OF PRESS COVERAGE RIGHT SO LIKE THE WORST YOU ARE AS A HUMAN BEING
POD1000000043_S0000248	THE THE MORE TERRIBLE YOU ARE CONSISTENTLY THE LESS LIKELY YOU ARE TO LIKE GET HAMMERED OVER AN ISSUE LIKE THIS AND WHEN IT COMES TO MITCH MCCONNELL HE SPENT MONTHS REFUSING TO ENGAGE WITH DEMOCRATS OVER COVID RELIEF PERIOD RIGHT LIKE AND NOW HE WANTS TO PUNISH STATES
POD1000000043_S0000249	BECAUSE THEIR FINANCES HAVE BEEN DECIMATED BY LOCKDOWNS THAT WERE MADE NECESSARY BY A FEDERAL RESPONSE THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY MISERABLE AND AGAIN LIKE LOVE MENTIONED HIS TOP PRIORITY IS LIABILITY PROTECTION FOR BUSINESSES
POD1000000043_S0000250	WHAT LIKE MITCH MCCONNELL HAS BLOOD ON HIS HANDS PEOPLE ARE WAITING FOR HOURS IN FOOD LINES BECAUSE OF MITCH MCCONNELL RIGHT LIKE STATES HAVE TO DECIDE WHO GETS THIS VACCINE FIRST THEY HAVE TO DISTRIBUTE IT THEY HAVE TO DO ALL THESE LOGISTICS AND HE'S PREVENTING THEM FROM GETTING THAT MONEY
POD1000000043_S0000251	RIGHT NOW MITCH MCCONNELL IS BLOCKING A BIPARTISAN BILL TO PREVENT PATIENTS WHO HAVE INSURANCE FROM GETTING SURPRISE MEDICAL BILLS FOR UNEXPECTED OUT OF NETWORK OR EMERGENCY CARE WHY
POD1000000043_S0000252	BECAUSE HE CARES MORE ABOUT PRIVATE EQUITY BACKED INSURANCE COMPANY PROFITS THAN REGULAR PEOPLE MCCONNELL IS ONE OF THE WORST PEOPLE IN POLITICAL LIFE IN POLITICAL HISTORY HE'S DISGUSTING HE'S A CORPORATE STAGE HE'S CYNICAL
POD1000000043_S0000253	AND LIKE THE COVERAGE OF HIM AND HOW HE ACTS IS IS TALKED ABOUT AS SORT OF SAVVY OR TOUGH AND IMPRESSIVE THE REALITY IS HE'S A MONSTER HE'S A MONSTER HE'S A BAD LEGISLATOR ALL HE DOES IS BLOCK SHIT EVERYTHING THEY DO IS
POD1000000043_S0000255	YOU GET PUNISHED FOR TRYING YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN IT'S LIKE EVERYONE'S HAMMERING PELOSI ONLINE FOR ENGAGING OR NOT ENGAGING FUCKING TWEETING OUT PICTURES OF THE AMOUNT OF ICE CREAM SHE HAS IN HER FREEZER LIKE MITCH MCCONNELL IS THE CLEAR ENEMY HAS BEEN ALL ALONG
POD1000000043_S0000257	BUT THIS THIS DRIVES ME NUTS LIKE AND YOU KNOW WHY MITCH MCCONNELL IS GOING TO GET HIS WAY ON THIS AND THIS DEAL IS PROBABLY GOING TO PASS WITH ALL THE SHIT THAT HE WANTS IN IT OR DOESN'T WANT IN IT IS BECAUSE HE'S GOT THE FUCKING NUMBERS AND HE'S GOT DONALD TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE LIKE I SAW YOU KNOW
POD1000000043_S0000258	BERNIE SANDERS SAID THE DEAL IS BAD AND WE SHOULD SUPPORT THE DEAL AND LIKE I AGREE WITH HIM IN THE SENSE THAT THE DEAL IS FUCKING BAD THE BIPARTISAN COMPROMISE IS BAD
POD1000000043_S0000259	NOW THAT THEY'VE SEPARATED STATE AND LOCAL AID AND LIABILITY PROTECTION WHAT'S LEFT OVER IS EVEN MORE INADEQUATE THAN THE BIPARTISAN COMPROMISE IT'S IT'S SHIT FOR SURE BUT LIKE
POD1000000043_S0000260	WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE CHOICE HERE LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO NEGOTIATE A BETTER PACKAGE WITH THESE REPUBLICANS WHO ARE YOU GOING TO GET TO VOTE FOR MORE MONEY YOU'RE GOING TO GET SUSAN COLLINS AND MITT ROMNEY TO VOTE FOR MORE MONEY AND LISA MURKOWSKI NO THEY SAID THIS IS HIS BEST THAT THEY WOULD DO
POD1000000043_S0000261	AND IF YOU DON'T TAKE THE DEAL AND WE DON'T WIN GEORGIA WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET A BETTER DEAL WHEN JOE BIDEN'S PRESIDENT AND JOE BIDEN'S NOT GOING TO HAVE A MECHANISM TO FORCE A BETTER DEAL BECAUSE MITCH MCCONNELL'S GOING TO SIT THERE AND SAY FUCK YOU I HAVE THE NUMBERS I DON'T HAVE TO PASS A DEAL
POD1000000043_S0000262	IF THEY REALLY DO PULL OUT STATE AND LOCAL AID AND THEY PULL OUT THE LIABILITY PROTECTION WHICH OBVIOUSLY NONE OF US THINK SHOULD BE PART OF THIS AT ALL MAKES NO SENSE AND THEY HAVE SAID FROM THE BEGINNING THEY WON'T DO A TRILLION DOES MEAN KEEP IN MIND DEMOCRATS RIGHT WE'VE COME DOWN FROM
POD1000000043_S0000264	TWO TRILLION TO ONE FIVE NOW WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO ONE WHAT I DON'T KNOW IS WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY REPLACE THE STATE AND LOCAL AID AS IT WAS DRAFTED WITH DIRECT PAYMENTS DOES THAT BECOME SOMETHING THAT GETS PEOPLE LIKE BERNIE BACK ON BOARD
POD1000000043_S0000265	I DON'T KNOW MAYBE MAYBE YOU TRY THAT I MEAN BERNIE IS ONE THING BUT LIKE LIKE JOSH HAWLEY OR SOME OF THESE REPUBLICANS WHO WANT DIRECT PAYMENTS YEAH I WOULD I WOULD TRY TO GET AS MUCH IN THERE AS I COULD YOU KNOW AND I WOULD TRY TO PUSH MORE DIRECT PAYMENTS FOR SURE BUT LIKE AT THE END OF THE DAY
POD1000000043_S0000266	I WOULD ALSO TAKE WHATEVER'S LEFT BECAUSE OF COURSE IS BETTER THAN NOTHING FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT
POD1000000043_S0000267	LOOK CONGRESS DOESN'T DO ANYTHING WELL ANYMORE WHAT THEY DO IS THEY JAM EVERY BILL THEY'RE EVER SUPPOSED TO PASS TOGETHER IN WHAT'S CALLED AN OMNIBUS AND THE DEADLINE FOR THAT BILL WHICH IS CURRENTLY I THINK ONE POINT FOUR TRILLION WITH A T DOLLARS IS FRIDAY
POD1000000043_S0000268	OR ELSE THE GOVERNMENT SHUTS DOWN THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO JAM WHATEVER LIKE COVID RELIEF MEASURES THEY CAN INTO THAT AND THAT'S KIND OF LIKE THE BEST AND ONLY SHOT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE UNTIL FEBRUARY MARCH I DON'T KNOW
POD1000000043_S0000270	I ALSO WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY IS YEAH THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT AND SO LIKE THIS
POD1000000043_S0000272	IF THERE'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING CLOSE TO A TRILLION DOLLARS RELIEF BILL IT WILL BE INADEQUATE IT WILL BE TERRIBLY INADEQUATE AND PEOPLE WILL BE SUFFERING NEXT YEAR
POD1000000043_S0000273	AND IF WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS REPLACING STATE AND LOCAL AID WITH DIRECT PAYMENTS TO PEOPLE YOU ARE YOU ARE KIND OF CHANGING WHERE THAT INADEQUACY AND WHERE THAT PAIN WILL BE FELT
POD1000000043_S0000274	AND BASICALLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS NEXT YEAR YOU WANT STATES AND LOCALITIES TO BE PUT IN INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT POSITIONS RIGHT AS HOPEFULLY WE'RE EMERGING FROM THIS TO CUT TRANSPORTATION CUT SCHOOLS CUT PUBLIC HEALTH
POD1000000043_S0000275	DEFUND THE POLICE SOMETHING REPUBLICANS SEEM TO BELIEVE IS SOMETHING THAT THEY OPPOSE AND EVERY OTHER LOCAL SERVICE SO IT REALLY IS LIKE

POD1000000043_S0000287	EVEN THOUGH THEIR FALSE CONSPIRACIES ABOUT VOTER FRAUD HAVE ESSENTIALLY BEEN UNANIMOUSLY REJECTED BY ELECTION OFFICIALS AND JUDGES FROM ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM LIBERAL AND CONSERVATIVE DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN

POD1000000043_S0000292	INCLUDING MINORITY LEADER KEVIN MCCARTHY WHO WANTS TO BE FUCKING SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE IN TWO YEARS ALL THESE PEOPLE PUBLICLY SUPPORTED AN ATTEMPT TO OVERTURN THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION PUBLICLY SUPPORTED AND LENT THEIR NAMES TO
POD1000000043_S0000293	WHAT DO YOU GUYS TAKE AWAY FROM THAT TOMMY
POD1000000043_S0000294	I MEAN I TAKE AWAY THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS NO LONGER A PARTY IT'S A CULT AND THE CULT LEADER IS ABOUT TO BE OUT OF OFFICE BUT HE IS STILL MIXING UP A BIG VADALA AND HE HAS NOT LOOSENED HIS GRIP ON THESE PEOPLE AT ALL
POD1000000043_S0000295	DOESN'T MATTER HOW IRRATIONAL THE DEMAND IS IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT THE DEMANDS ARE ILLEGAL THE MAGA CULT DOES NOT BELIEVE IN DEMOCRACY THEY BELIEVE IN TRUMP
POD1000000043_S0000296	AND YOU KNOW I JUST PEOPLE LOVE TO BOTH SIDES AND DECRY PARTISANSHIP LIKE WE SHOULD JUST BE CLEAR THIS IS A VERY NEW THING LIKE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WAS SUPPORTIVE OF OBAMA
POD1000000043_S0000297	BUT IF HE HAD SAID FALSELY THAT THE BP OIL SPILL WAS FIXED WHEN EVERYONE WAS WATCHING OIL GUSHING OUT OF IT ON LIVE TV ZERO DEMOCRATS WOULD HAVE FALLEN IN LINE BEHIND HIM RIGHT
POD1000000043_S0000298	BUT LIKE TRUMP'S COVID DENIAL IS WORSE THAN THAT THIS THIS ELECTORAL FICTION HE'S PEDDLING IS WORSE THAN THAT AND SO IT'S A VERY SCARY THING
POD1000000043_S0000299	I WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT IT WILL BE DESTRUCTIVE FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND THAT MAYBE DEMOCRATS CAN WIN BUT THE ODDS ARE THAT TWENTY TWENTY TWO IS GOING TO BE BRUTAL BECAUSE OF REDISTRICTING AND SO WE SHOULDN'T COUNT ON
POD1000000043_S0000300	I DON'T KNOW THE WAY AROUND IT LIKE I HOPE THAT PEOPLE WILL GET TIRED OF A STICK BUT THAT WAS MY HOPE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND THEN SIXTEEN AND THEN YOU KNOW THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY HAPPENED AND OBVIOUSLY THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN
POD1000000043_S0000301	I HATE TO SAY IT GUYS LIKE WELL ONE OBVIOUS THING THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL IS WINNING THESE GEORGIA RUNOFFS BUT THEN I HATE TO SAY IT BUT IT WOULD IT WOULD ALSO HELP I THINK IF BRIAN KEMP SURVIVED HIS PRIMARY CHALLENGE
POD1000000043_S0000302	THAT'S GOING TO COME I MEAN LIKE WE NEED SOME ANTI TRUMP REPUBLICANS TO START WINNING SO THAT THEY'RE ALL NOT LIVING IN FEAR OF A PRIMARY CHALLENGE FROM A TRUMP BACKED CANDIDATE OTHERWISE THE GUY IS JUST GOING TO HOLD A GRIP ON THE PARTY
POD1000000043_S0000303	GRIP ON FOX NEWS A GRIP ON NEW MACS AND IT'S WE'RE STUCK IN THIS CYCLE I THINK WE HAVE TO BEAT THEM ALL I MEAN I DON'T I JUST LIKE THERE'S NO LOOK I KNOW HOW HARD THE HOUSE IS GOING TO BE IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO I DON'T KNOW IF EVERYONE REALIZES THIS BUT IT'S IT'S GONNA BE HARD NO MATTER WHAT NOW WITH REDISTRICTING IT'S GOING TO BE EVEN HARDER
POD1000000043_S0000304	BUT LIKE I DON'T SEE AN OPTION BESIDES WINNING THE HOUSE OR HOLDING THE HOUSE IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO
POD1000000043_S0000305	BECAUSE IF LIKE YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN SAYING THAT A LOT OF THE CONCERN OVER DONALD TRUMP SUCCESSFULLY OVERTURN THIS ELECTION IS IS A LITTLE OVER
POD1000000043_S0000306	BECAUSE WE HAVE DEMOCRATS IN ALL THE RIGHT POSITION BECAUSE WE CONTROL THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES BECAUSE WE CONTROLLED THE GOVERNORSHIPS IN WISCONSIN MICHIGAN AND PENNSYLVANIA LIKE THAT'S THE ONLY REASON THAT I FELT SAFE
POD1000000043_S0000307	AND SAYING THAT JOE BIDEN IS GOING TO BE PRESIDENT IF WE HAVE A REPUBLICAN HOUSE IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR NOT ONLY DO I THINK THEY'LL HAVE IMPEACHED JOE BIDEN BY THEN THEY'LL JUST MAKE UP SOME REASON TO DO THAT
POD1000000043_S0000308	BUT THEN IN THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR ELECTION IF THE IF THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE OR IF IT'S TRUMP PULLS WHAT TRUMP PULLED AGAIN IT GOES TO CONGRESS AND NOW YOU HAVE A REPUBLICAN HOUSE
POD1000000043_S0000309	AND DO WE REALLY THINK THE REPUBLICAN HOUSE IS GOING TO PLAY BY THE RULES AFTER WHAT HAPPENED THIS TIME I DON'T THINK SO
POD1000000043_S0000310	YEAH I THINK WE SHOULD NOT CONFUSE THE FACT THAT THIS COUP WILL FAIL AND THAT ITS INSTIGATORS ARE SILLY AND BUFFOONISH FROM HOW DANGEROUS THIS MOMENT IS I DON'T THINK I THINK THAT THAT'S SORT OF TRIVIAL I THINK WE ALL GET THAT
POD1000000043_S0000311	BUT THEN I DO THINK THAT THERE'S THIS PROBLEM IT'S LIKE OK WELL WHAT DO WE DO WELL WE KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO WE NEED TO WIN ELECTIONS RIGHT AND THE PROBLEM IS WE JUST RAN A NATIONAL ELECTION
POD1000000043_S0000312	IN WHICH WE WON WE WON BY FOUR POINT FIVE PERCENT OF THE VOTE BUT GIVEN WHERE OUR VOTERS ARE GIVEN SOME OF THE INHERENT ANTI DEMOCRATIC ASPECTS OF THE SENATE
POD1000000043_S0000313	IT WAS NOT ENOUGH TO TO WIN THAT TO WIN THE SENATE AND WE STILL MANAGED TO LOSE SOME HOUSE SEATS AND THOSE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS ARE NOT GOING ANYWHERE WE'RE NOT ABOLISHING THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE
POD1000000043_S0000314	IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS WE'RE NOT GETTING RID OF THE SENATE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME REALLY BAD REDISTRICTING THAT'S GOING TO HURT US BECAUSE WE DID SO POORLY IN LEGISLATURE
POD1000000043_S0000315	AND SO TO ME LIKE I DO THINK WE HAVE TO SPLIT THESE THINGS INTO KIND OF TWO BIG DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS ONE IS HOW DO WE WIN INSIDE OF DEMOCRACY AND THE OTHER IS HOW DO WE PRESERVE DEMOCRACY AND FIGHT FOR IT AGAINST A PARTY THAT HAS A BAND
POD1000000043_S0000316	I NO LONGER AM INTERESTED IN STORIES ABOUT HOW REPUBLICANS BEHIND THE SCENES SAY THEY DON'T REALLY MEAN IT NO YOU DO MEAN IT THIS IS IT IT'S NOT YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT IN PRIVATE SAYING THAT YOU DON'T SUPPORT WHAT YOU SUPPORT
POD1000000043_S0000317	ACTUALLY IN PRIVATE YOU'RE PRETENDING TO HOLD A SET OF BELIEFS THAT NOTHING IN YOUR POLITICS NOTHING IN YOUR PUBLIC STATEMENTS IS TRUE YOU'RE PRETENDING TO NOT BELIEVE IT WHILE EVERYTHING YOU DO SUBVERTS DEMOCRACY
POD1000000043_S0000318	TED CRUZ IS NOT PUTTING ON A SHOW TED CRUZ IS DOING WHAT HE THINKS IS IN HIS BEST INTEREST HE'S NOT DOING IT HE'S NOT GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND HE'S NOT SAYING HE WANTS TO ARGUE BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT BECAUSE HE'S AFRAID OF TRUMP HE'S HE'S CHOSEN ASIDE HE'S SEEN WHERE HIS PEOPLE ARE GOING SO THAT HE CAN LEAD THEM
POD1000000043_S0000319	WHAT THEY LEARNED FROM TRUMP IS THAT SHAME IS NOT A USEFUL ATTRIBUTE TO HAVE IN POLITICS SO THEY ARE ALL SHAMELESS YOU CANNOT SHAME THESE PEOPLE ALL WE DO ALL THESE REPUBLICANS GOT TO LEARN BETTER WE'RE JUST GOING TO PUT PRESSURE ON THEM
POD1000000043_S0000320	WE'RE NOT PUTTING ANY PRESSURE ON THEM THEY DON'T PRESSURE IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR SHAME IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR ANYMORE THEY HAVE TO BE BEATEN THAT'S LIKE I KNOW LIKE WE YOU KNOW WE WE DID WIN THIS TIME AND HE TRIED TO STEAL IT BUT IT WAS ENOUGH
POD1000000043_S0000321	IT WAS A BIG ENOUGH MARGIN THAT HE WAS NOT ABLE TO STEAL IT AND WE THE ONLY THING WE CAN DO IN THE FUTURE IS TO BEAT THESE PEOPLE AND LIKE YOU SAID LIKE WE'RE NOT GOING TO ELIMINATE THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE BEFORE THEN BEFORE WE BEAT THEM WE'RE NOT GOING TO FIX GERRYMANDERING BEFORE WE BEAT THE
POD1000000043_S0000322	WE'RE NOT GOING TO FIX THE SENATE BEFORE WE BEAT THEM ALL ROADS LEAD BACK TO BEATING THEM IN ELECTIONS THERE'S NOTHING ELSE
POD1000000043_S0000323	YEAH AND AND I WOULD SAY TO LIKE THE NEXT THE THE CONVERSATION WE SHOULD HAVE IS OBVIOUSLY NOT ABOUT SHAME BUT I DO THINK WE SHOULD BE TALKING AND I DO THINK IT'S A MUCH LONGER TERM CHALLENGE THAN EVEN WHAT WE'LL HAVE TO DO ELECTORALLY TO KEEP THE HOUSE AND TO KEEP THE WHITE HOUSE
POD1000000043_S0000324	AND IT IS LIKE ALL RIGHT THEY'RE SHAMELESS THEY'RE MERCENARIES THEY'RE DOING WHAT THEY THINK IS IN THEIR INTERESTS WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY DON'T VIEW DEFENDING DEMOCRACY IS IN THEIR INTERESTS RIGHT THAT THAT PROPAGANDA HAS SO THOROUGHLY TAKEN HOLD
POD1000000043_S0000325	LIKE WHEN YOU SAY LIKE THEY DON'T RESPOND TO SHAME LIKE WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IT MEANS THAT LIKE VIRTUE INTEGRITY THESE QUALITIES NO LONGER MATTER IN OUR POLITICS BEING HONEST CARING ABOUT THE BASIC CIVIC IDEAS THAT ARE THE BEDROCK OF OUR COUNTRY THEY'RE NOT IMPORTANT ANYMORE

POD1000000043_S0000431	THAT HAVE PULLED THIS COUNTRY BACKWARDS IN OUR HISTORY WERE WERE WERE NO WEREN'T GENIUSES THERE WERE NO THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO BE BECAUSE WHEN YOU EMPLOY VIOLENCE WHEN YOU INTRODUCE THE SPECTRE OF VIOLENCE ACROSS OUR POLITICS
POD1000000043_S0000432	AND WARP THINGS AND CHANGE THINGS WITHOUT YOU HAVING TO BE VERY SOPHISTICATED AND I JUST THINK THAT REQUIRE LIKE I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THAT INFORMATION I DON'T IT'S BUT IT'S JUST SOMETHING WE ALL SHOULD KEEP IN
POD1000000043_S0000433	LIKE DON'T TAKE COMFORT IN THEIR STUPIDITY WE JUST CAN'T
POD1000000043_S0000435	YEAH IT IS IT'S STILL AN OPEN QUESTION OF HOW BIG THEIR NUMBERS ARE AND AND PART OF THIS IS MAKING SURE THE NUMBERS DON'T GET BIGGER YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE ASSHOLES WHO DESCENDED ON D C BUT THERE'S OTHER PEOPLE WHO COULD FALL INTO THAT KIND OF TRAP
POD1000000043_S0000436	AND YOU WANT TO AVOID THAT I MEAN LIKE THERE WAS A NEW CBS POLL OUT OVER THE WEEKEND YOU KNOW AND IT GIVES THE USUAL NUMBERS ONLY EIGHTEEN PERCENT OF TRUMP VOTERS THINK BIDEN THE LEGITIMATE WINNER OF THE ELECTION FORTY NINE PERCENT THINK TRUMP SHOULD REFUSE TO CONCEDE EVEN IF THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES FOR BIDEN WHICH THEY WILL
POD1000000043_S0000437	AND SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT THINK REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS SHOULD TRY TO KEEP IN TRUMP IN POWER BUT THEN I SAW AT THE END THE LAST QUESTION WAS FORTY PERCENT OF TRUMP VOTERS BELIEVE THAT IF BIDEN IS THE PRESIDENT
POD1000000043_S0000438	THAT TRUMP AND HIS SUPPORTERS SHOULD WORK TOGETHER WITH BIDEN ON MAKING PROGRESS WHICH SURPRISED ME BECAUSE I'M LIKE THESE SAME PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY'RE THE ELECTION NOT LEGITIMATE YOU KNOW SIXTY PERCENT OF THEM THINK NEVER WORK WITH BIDEN ON ANYTHING SO THAT'S STILL A MAJORITY
POD1000000043_S0000439	THAT FORTY PERCENT MIGHT BE WHERE YOU BEGIN YOU KNOW IT'S THE ONLY OPTION WE HAVE AT THIS POINT
POD1000000043_S0000440	WELL I ALSO JUST THINK IT'S INTERESTING TOO IT'S IMPORTANT TOO BECAUSE WHAT IT DOES ALSO SHOW YOU IS THAT THESE ARE IN SOME SENSE PERFORMATIVE REACTIONS EVEN TO POLLSTERS WE'RE ALL PUNDITS NOW WE'RE ALL ON A TEAM
POD1000000043_S0000441	AND LIKE THAT'S A GOOD THING IN THE SENSE THAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING THINGS THEY DON'T TOTALLY MEAN IT'S A DANGEROUS THING IN WHICH BELIEFS THEMSELVES ARE NOW HOW YOU DEMONSTRATE YOUR GUILTY WHICH MEANS NOBODY IS GOING TO BE TELLING THE TRUTH
POD1000000043_S0000442	AND YOU KNOW LIKE SORRY I'M GONNA I'M GONNA DO IT VONAGE THE QUOTE WHICH I THINK ABOUT ALL THE TIME THESE DAYS IS YOU KNOW YOU ARE WHAT YOU PRETEND TO BE SO BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU PRETEND TO BE YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T MATTER
POD1000000043_S0000443	THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT PEOPLE SAY AND WHAT THEY THINK IS IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER BECAUSE WHAT PEOPLE SAY AND WHAT THEY PERFORM IS WHAT BECOMES OUR POLI
POD1000000043_S0000444	I'M GONNA I'M GONNA FOLLOW SUIT HERE SO I WAS READING OBAMA'S BOOK AND THEN I STARTED READING LIKE AN OLD BOOK I HAD FROM COLLEGE FROM VACLAV HAVEL WHO IS A PLAYWRIGHT WRITER THINKER POLITICAL LEADER IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC
POD1000000043_S0000445	AND HE TALKS ABOUT SORT OF HOW EVERY COUNTRY EVERY CULTURE EVERY LIKE SOCIETY HAS THESE SORT OF POLLS RIGHT THERE'S ALWAYS SORT OF A FASCISTIC CAMP AND THERE'S ALWAYS A MORE HOPEFUL CAMP AND IT IS UP TO THE LEADERS TO DECIDE WHICH ONE OF THOSE YOU AWAKEN
POD1000000043_S0000446	AND TRUMP HAS SPENT FOUR TO SIX YEARS AWAKENING THE SCARY FASCISTIC RIGHT WING CAMP AND THE NEXT REPUBLICAN LIKE RONALD REAGAN WAS AWFUL HE DID IMMEASURABLE DAMAGE TO THIS COUNTRY
POD1000000043_S0000447	BUT HE DIDN'T DO THAT AND WE BARELY SURVIVE THAT AND THE NEXT SET OF REPUBLICAN LEADERS BETTER BE PRETTY GODDAMN CAREFUL
POD1000000043_S0000448	ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY DECIDE TO REAWAKEN THOSE FASCISTIC FORCES BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THOSE PEOPLE ARE YOU KNOW THEY'RE IN D C OVER THE WEEKEND SAYING CHANTING DESTROY THE GOP BECAUSE THEY WON'T GO ALONG WITH THE COUP ATTEMPT SO YEAH THAT SHIT WILL BITE YOU BACK
POD1000000043_S0000449	AND YOU KNOW YOU TALKED ABOUT FUTURE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTS BUT IT'S ALSO THIS IS THIS WAS PART OF JOE BIDEN'S MESSAGE IN THE CAMPAIGN TALKING ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT TO PROJECT TO THE COUNTRY AND WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY THAT YOU WANT TO HAVE YOU KNOW LIKE
POD1000000043_S0000450	AND DO I HAVE A LOT OF OPTIMISM THAT JOE BIDEN MITCH MCCONNELL ARE GOING TO SIT DOWN AND HAMMER OUT SOME DEALS TOGETHER NO I DON'T BUT I THINK BIDEN'S MESSAGE WAS BIGGER THAN I'M GOING TO WORK WITH REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS IT'S ABOUT YOU KNOW A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE COUNTRY AND HEALING THE NATION
POD1000000043_S0000451	AND I THINK PROJECTING THAT IMAGE TO THE COUNTRY IT MATTERS
POD1000000043_S0000453	AND OH BY THE WAY LET'S ADD TO THE LIST AS HE PROJECTS THAT VISION TO THE COUNTRY HE ALSO PERHAPS WITHOUT A SENATE HOPEFULLY WITH A SENATE THAT'S INCREDIBLY DIVIDED REGARDLESS

POD1000000044_S0000070	ACCORDING TO ALVIN ONCE YOU'VE DISCOVERED THIS OPTIMAL PERSONHOOD YOU CAN SHAKE OFF WHAT OTHERS WANT AND LIVE ON YOUR OWN TERMS
POD1000000044_S0000071	IT CHANGED MY LIFE DIRECTION
POD1000000044_S0000072	AND FOR THESE KINDS OF RADICAL RESULTS ALVIN WAS GIVEN A LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD FROM THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION
POD1000000044_S0000073	ONE PSYCHOLOGY TEXTBOOK EVEN GOES SO FAR AS TO DESCRIBE ALVIN AS BEING AS IMPORTANT AS FREUD
POD1000000044_S0000075	BUT THIS ISN'T A STORY ABOUT ALVIN'S PROFESSIONAL LIFE HIS LIFE INSIDE THE OFFICE THIS IS A STORY ABOUT ALVIN'S REAL LIFE
POD1000000044_S0000076	HE INSISTED I RAN AWAY
POD1000000044_S0000077	THIS IS RACHEL ALVIN'S DAUGHTER
POD1000000044_S0000078	AND I DID
POD1000000044_S0000079	HOW OLD WERE YOU
POD1000000044_S0000080	IN GRADE FIVE
POD1000000044_S0000081	THE YEAR WAS NINETEEN SEVENTY ALVIN AND RACHEL'S MOM HAD BEEN LOCKED IN AN UGLY CUSTODY BATTLE FOR EIGHT YEARS
POD1000000044_S0000082	RACHEL'S MOM WAS POOR AND STRUGGLED WITH DEPRESSION RACHEL REALLY WANTED TO LIVE WITH HER DAD SO WHEN ALVIN SUGGESTED SHE RUN AWAY FROM JUDY IN DENVER TO HIS HOUSE IN OHIO RACHEL DIDN'T PACK A BAG SHE DIDN'T SAY GOOD BYE TO ANYONE
POD1000000044_S0000083	SHE JUST LAUGHED
POD1000000044_S0000084	LIKE HE SET UP THIS WHOLE THING WITH HIS LAWYER AND I JUST FELT LIKE I NEEDED TO DO WHAT MY DAD AND THE LAWYER TOLD ME AND THIS WAS THE RIGHT THING I THINK I SAID I WAS GOING TO THE LIBRARY AND
POD1000000044_S0000085	SOMEHOW I DON'T REMEMBER HOW I GOT TO THE LAWYER'S OFFICE AND THEN THEY TOOK ME TO THE AIRPORT AND PUT ME ON THE PLANE AND I LEFT
POD1000000044_S0000087	ALVIN HAD GOTTEN REMARRIED TO A WOMAN WITH TWO KIDS AND RACHEL LOVED FEELING LIKE SHE WAS A PART OF THIS HAPPY FAMILY THERE WERE DOGS TO PLAY WITH AND BIKES TO RIDE AND YET THIS OTHER FEELING WOULD OFTEN CREEP IN
POD1000000044_S0000088	I MISS MY MOM I MISS MY FRIENDS I MISS MY CAT BUT I COULD NEVER EVER EVER SAY THAT OUT LOUD TO ANYBODY
POD1000000044_S0000089	AND THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE RACHEL MISSED MISSED MOST OF ALL
POD1000000044_S0000091	SHE TOLD US SHE WAS GOING TO THE LIBRARY AND THEN SHE NEVER CAME BACK
POD1000000044_S0000092	THIS IS RACHEL'S BROTHER JOHN HE'S TWO AND A HALF YEARS YOUNGER THAN RACHEL AND ONLY HAS FLASHES OF EARLY CHILDHOOD MEMORY ABOUT ALVIN
POD1000000044_S0000093	HE RECALLS DOING FATHER SON THINGS THAT WOULD MAKE PERFECT SENSE IF THE SON WAS AN ADULT THINGS LIKE LIFTING WEIGHTS TOGETHER AND SMOKING
POD1000000044_S0000094	HE WAS A PIPE SMOKER HE BOUGHT ME MY OWN LITTLE CHERRY WOOD PIPE AND YOU KNOW AS A FOUR YEAR OLD HE ACTUALLY HAD ME SMOKING YOU KNOW TOBACCO IN THE PIPE WITH HIM
POD1000000044_S0000095	IT WAS AS THOUGH ALVIN COULDN'T DISTINGUISH BETWEEN ADULTS AND CHILDREN WHICH WAS WHY HE SAW JOHN'S CLOSENESS WITH HIS MOM NOT AS A CHILD'S NATURAL MATERNAL ATTACHMENT BUT RATHER AS A PERSONAL SLIGHT
POD1000000044_S0000096	AND SO ALVIN NEVER ASKED JOHN TO RUN AWAY JOHN WAS LEFT BEHIND IN DENVER WITH JUDY
POD1000000044_S0000097	I THINK IN HIS MIND I JUST YOU KNOW WAS MORE A MAMA'S BOY AND A CHIP OFF JUDY'S BLOCK AND I THINK HE SORT OF GAVE UP ON ME AND HE WAS REALLY FOCUSED ON RACHEL
POD1000000044_S0000098	AND AS THE FINAL CUSTODY HEARING APPROACHED ALVIN'S FOCUS ON RACHEL INTENSIFIED HE WANTED TO PROVE TO THE COURT THAT RACHEL WAS BETTER OFF WITH HIM SO HE HAD ABOUT A HALF DOZEN SOCIAL WORKERS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS OFFER ASSESSMENTS
POD1000000044_S0000099	RACHEL WAS INTERVIEWED AND ALVIN'S NEW FAMILY OBSERVED NONE OF THE EXPERTS SPOKE TO JUDY AND THE PLAN WORKED
POD1000000044_S0000100	IN THE AUTUMN OF NINETEEN SEVENTY A JUDGE RULED THAT RACHEL WOULD BE ALLOWED TO STAY IN OHIO WITH ALL FOR GOOD BUT JOHN WOULD REMAIN IN DENVER WITH JUDY
POD1000000044_S0000101	AND WE NEVER LIVED TOGETHER AGAIN
POD1000000044_S0000103	WHEN YOU HAVE A SIBLING WHO IS JUST A CRITICAL PART OF YOUR FAMILY AND THEN YOU'RE SEPARATED FROM THEM IT'S A WOUND
POD1000000044_S0000104	HOW UNCOMMON WAS SOMETHING WAS AN ARRANGEMENT LIKE THAT
POD1000000044_S0000105	EXTREME YEAH VERY VERY UNCOMMON KIDS ARE NOT SPLIT UP
POD1000000044_S0000106	WE EACH GREW UP ALONE I MISSED HER THROUGH MY WHOLE CHILDHOOD I MISSED HER A LOT
POD1000000044_S0000107	I MEAN WE WERE WE WERE SO CLOSE WHEN WE WERE YOUNG AND YOU KNOW SHE WAS THE BIG SISTER WHO THROUGH ALL OF THAT WAS LOOKING OUT FOR ME
POD1000000044_S0000109	GROWING UP FROM THEN ON JUST ME AND MY MOM GREW UP AS AN ONLY CHILD AND MY MOM JUST ALWAYS BEING IN PAIN AND
POD1000000044_S0000110	SHE NEVER WAS ABLE TO ENJOY WHATEVER IT IS WE WERE DOING AT THE MOMENT IT WAS ALWAYS OH IF ONLY RACHEL WERE HERE WE COULD ALL BE TOGETHER AND I'D BE SAYING BUT BUT WE'RE HERE NOW
POD1000000044_S0000112	WHEN HE TURNED THIRTEEN JOHN INVITED RACHEL TO HIS BAR MITZVAH BUT ALVIN WOULDN'T LET HER GO RACHEL SENT A POEM INSTEAD
POD1000000044_S0000113	IT HAD TO DO WITH A RUBBER BAND STRETCHING ACROSS THE DISTANCE AND CONNECTING US
POD1000000044_S0000115	FOR JOHN NOT ONLY DID HE LOSE HIS BIG SISTER HE ALSO LOST HIS DAD YEAR AFTER YEAR JOHN TRIED TO REENTER ALVIN'S LIFE BUT EACH TIME HE REACHED OUT ALVIN REBUKED HIM
POD1000000044_S0000116	ONE TIME AS AN ADOLESCENT JOHN TRIED SCHEDULING A VISIT
POD1000000044_S0000117	AND HE SAID WELL AS LONG AS YOU GUYS YOU KNOW ME AND MY MOM REQUIRED ANY MONEY ANY CHILD SUPPORT THERE'D BE NO VISIT
POD1000000044_S0000118	AND I SAID WELL IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU CARE MORE ABOUT MONEY THAN ABOUT ME AND HE SAID WELL I DON'T WANT IT TO JUST SOUND LIKE THAT THAT'S HOW IT IS
POD1000000044_S0000120	NEVERTHELESS A FEW YEARS LATER JOHN ASKED ONCE AGAIN IF HE COULD COME VISIT BY THIS POINT RACHEL WAS EIGHTEEN AND NO LONGER LIVING WITH ALVIN
POD1000000044_S0000121	SO WHEN ALVIN REFUSED JOHN YET AGAIN RACHEL TOLD HER BROTHER TO COME VISIT HER INSTEAD THEY HADN'T SEEN EACH OTHER IN EIGHT YEARS WAS SHE THE SAME SISTER THAT YOU REMEMBERED
POD1000000044_S0000122	NO I MEAN I KNEW HER AS A YOU KNOW
POD1000000044_S0000124	SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE TEN YEAR OLD NEXT TIME I SAW HER SHE WAS AN ADULT
POD1000000044_S0000126	IN THE YEARS SINCE THAT VISIT RACHEL AND JOHN HAVE MADE A POINT OF STAYING IN EACH OTHER'S LIVES THEY TALK ON THE PHONE CELEBRATE HOLIDAYS TOGETHER AND ONCE A YEAR THEIR FAMILIES ALL TAKE A TRIP BUT THEIR CHILDHOOD TOGETHER THAT'S BEEN LOST
POD1000000044_S0000127	I MEAN MY DAUGHTER CERTAINLY WATCHES US AND THINKS THAT WE'RE MORE LIKE COUSINS SHE CAN SEE THE THE DISCONNECT BECAUSE WE DID NOT GROW UP TOGETHER
POD1000000044_S0000128	JOHN AND RACHEL STILL HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR CHILDHOOD BUT NOW THAT THEIR PARENTS ARE BOTH DEAD THEY HAVE NO ONE TO ASK SO THEY PASS THROUGH THEIR SEPARATE MEMORIES TRYING TO CONSTRUCT A TIMELINE COMPARING MOMENTS OF OVERLAP AND FILLING IN THE BLANKS
POD1000000044_S0000129	TO THIS END ONE NIGHT WHILE JOHN WAS VISITING RACHEL FOR THANKSGIVING HE ASKED IF THEY COULD GO THROUGH ALVIN'S FILES
POD1000000044_S0000131	ALVIN WAS AN OBSESSIVE RECORD KEEPER AND AFTER HE DIED RACHEL INHERITED HIS PAPERS SHE NEVER REALLY GONE THROUGH THEM KEEPING THEM STORED AWAY IN A FILING CABINET BUT THAT NIGHT SHE PULLED THEM OUT
POD1000000044_S0000132	AND TOGETHER JOHN AND RACHEL MADE A SERIES OF DISTURBING DISCOVERIES THE FIRST OF WHICH WAS THE SCRIPT
POD1000000044_S0000134	SCRIPT FOR ME WAS LIKE OH MY GOD
POD1000000044_S0000136	THE SCRIPT WAS A LENGTHY DIATRIBE WRITTEN BY ALVIN FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF A CHILD RACHEL'S POINT OF VIEW
POD1000000044_S0000137	IN IT ALVIN REFERS TO HIMSELF AS DADDY JUDY IS MOTHER OR JUDY OR SIMPLY SHE LATER ASKED RACHEL TO READ SOME OVER THE PHONE
POD1000000044_S0000139	TWO AND A HALF PAGES LONG AND SMALL PSYCHOLOGIST WRITING OKAY SO HERE I GO IT'S IN MY GOOD HAPPY DREAMS CUSTODY IS CHANGED AND I LIVE WITH DADDY
POD1000000044_S0000140	IF I AM FORCED TO GO BACK AND LIVE WITH MOTHER IT WILL ONLY BE TILL THE DAY I'M FOURTEEN WHICH APPARENTLY WAS WHEN YOU COULD DECIDE
POD1000000044_S0000141	WHEN I'M WITH HER I FEEL SCARED THAT I MIGHT GET TIGHT AND ANGRY AND COLD LIKE JUDY SHE'S NOT A MOTHER SHE IS A KEEPER SHE MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I'M IN A PRISON I CAN'T LET HER TOUCH ME
POD1000000044_S0000142	IT WAS LIKE FINDING YOUR CHILDHOOD INTERNAL MONOLOGUE COMMITTED TO PAPER AND WRITTEN IN YOUR FATHER'S HANDWRITING RACHEL DIDN'T REMEMBER SEEING THE SCRIPT AS A KID BUT SHE REMEMBERED SAYING THOSE THINGS AND SHE REMEMBERED THINKING THEM
POD1000000044_S0000143	IN ONE OF ALVIN'S MANY BOOKS A VOLUME ENTITLED THE MANUAL OF OPTIMAL BEHAVIOR HE WRITES THAT BEHAVIOR CAN BE REHEARSED AND MODIFIED UNTIL YOU ARE READY AND EAGER TO GO AHEAD AND DO WHAT YOU HAVE REHEARSED AND MODIFIED
POD1000000044_S0000144	UNBEKNOWN TO HER ALVIN WAS HAVING RACHEL REHEARSE AND MODIFY
POD1000000044_S0000145	IT WAS SO
POD1000000044_S0000147	EXPLICIT THERE WAS NOTHING SUBTLE ABOUT IT YOU KNOW THE WHOLE THING WAS SICK
POD1000000044_S0000149	SECOND THING DISCOVERED AMONG THE FILES WAS A LETTER FROM RACHEL TO HER MOM IN IT SHE BEGGED JUDY TO LET HER LIVE WITH ALVIN BUT THERE WERE TWO COPIES ONE WRITTEN IN RACHEL'S HAND AND ONE WRITTEN IN ALVIN'S
POD1000000044_S0000151	GOING THROUGH THE PAPERS RACHEL REMEMBERED OTHER THINGS HOW ALVIN ENCOURAGED HER NOT TO SMILE WHEN SHE WAS WITH HER MOM SAYING IF SOMEONE PHOTOGRAPHED HER HAPPY IT COULD BE USED AS EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM IN COURT
POD1000000044_S0000152	IN EVERY PHOTO FROM THAT PERIOD WITH HER MOTHER RACHEL IS WEARING A FROWN
POD1000000044_S0000153	THAT'S WHEN I STARTED QUESTIONING AND STARTED TO REALIZE THAT I WAS COACHED OR BRAINWASHED
POD1000000044_S0000155	IT MADE SENSE FOR MOST OF HER ADULT LIFE RACHEL HAD HAD NO MEMORY OF LOVING HER MOM IT WAS ONLY AFTER HER MOTHER'S DEATH WHEN SHE FOUND MOTHER'S DAY AND BIRTHDAY CARD SHE'D WRITTEN TO JUDY WHEN SHE WAS VERY SMALL
POD1000000044_S0000156	THAT RACHEL REALIZED SHE HAD I LOVE YOU MOMMY SHE'D WRITTEN I LOVE YOU SO MUCH BUT WITH AL'S CONSTANT COACHING IT HAD ALL BEEN STAMPED OUT
POD1000000044_S0000158	THE FINAL THING JOHN AND RACHEL FOUND THAT NIGHT WERE THOSE PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORTS ALVIN HAD RACHEL SUBMIT TO JUST BEFORE THE FINAL CUSTODY HEARING IN THEM YOU SEE ALVIN'S SCRIPTING BEAR OUT
POD1000000044_S0000159	ONE REPORT NOTES THAT RACHEL KEPT REPEATING QUOTE I WANT TO LIVE WITH MY FATHER HE LOVES ME MY MOTHER DOESN'T LOVE ME THE REPORT NOTES THAT SHE SAID THIS WITH GRIM DETERMINATION
POD1000000044_S0000161	THEY ALSO UNCOVERED ONE PARTICULAR REPORT THAT NIGHT THAT WAS LONGER THAN ANY OF THE OTHERS IT WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT EVALUATED BOTH JOHN AND RACHEL AND IN THIS IT CARRIED THE MOST WEIGHT
POD1000000044_S0000163	AND WHAT SHOCKED JOHN AND RACHEL MOST OF ALL
POD1000000044_S0000164	MY DAD CLEARLY EDITED EDITED IT AND THEN SHE REWROTE IT WITH THE EDITS AND SUBMITTED THAT REWRITE
POD1000000044_S0000165	IS THAT ETHICAL AS A SOCIAL WORKER
POD1000000044_S0000166	NO NO NO NO NO NO IT'S NOT NO OH NO NO NO NO ONE SHOULD EVER LET ANYBODY ELSE ESPECIALLY THEIR CLIENT EDIT THEIR REPORTS NO IT'S IT'S REALLY BAD
POD1000000044_S0000167	THE REPORT WAS WRITTEN BY A SOCIAL WORKER NAMED JOYCE
POD1000000044_S0000169	ALVIN'S EDITS TO JOYCE'S REPORT MADE THE LANGUAGE MORE EMPHATIC FOR EXAMPLE WHERE JOYCE HAD WRITTEN THAT RACHEL WAS HESITANT WHEN IT CAME TO JUDY ALVIN CHANGED IT TO SAY SHE WAS FEARFUL IN ANOTHER SPOT
POD1000000044_S0000170	HE ADDED THAT RACHEL WANTED TO BLOT OUT ANY MEMORY OF EVER HAVING BEEN AWAY FROM HIM
POD1000000044_S0000171	HONESTLY I MEAN IT WAS HORRIFYING YOU KNOW JUST TO SEE THE DETAILED NOTES TO SEE THE EDITED DRAFTS THE CROSS OUT IN HIS HANDWRITING
POD1000000044_S0000172	AND THEN THE FINAL VERSION THAT WAS SUBMITTED TO THE COURTS WITH HIS EDITS IN THERE LIKE THERE'S NO QUESTION WHAT HAPPENED
POD1000000044_S0000174	THE REPORT CONCLUDES WITH A RECOMMENDATION THE STRONGEST ONE OF ANY REPORT AND THE ONLY RECOMMENDATION OF ITS KIND
POD1000000044_S0000175	SHE RECOMMENDED THAT I LIVE WITH HIM AND THAT MY BROTHER LIVE WITH MY MOM
POD1000000044_S0000176	JOHN AND RACHEL'S SEPARATION CAME DOWN TO A DECISION DICTATED BY ALVIN AND SIGNED OFF ON BY JOYCE
POD1000000044_S0000178	HOW WAS ALVIN ABLE TO EXERT THIS KIND OF POWER OVER A SOCIAL WORKER SOMEONE WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AN IMPARTIAL OUTSIDER JOHN AND RACHEL COULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT
POD1000000044_S0000179	BUT THAT NIGHT WHEN RACHEL GOOGLED JOYCE SHE WAS SHOCKED TO REALIZE THAT JOYCE HADN'T BEEN AN IMPARTIAL OUTSIDER AT ALL JOYCE WAS A FAMILY FRIEND
POD1000000044_S0000181	RACHEL RECOGNIZED JOYCE AS THE KIND DARK HAIRED WOMAN WHOSE HOUSE SHE VISITED AS A CHILD
POD1000000044_S0000182	RACHEL WOULD BRING HER CELLO OVER TO PLAY MUSIC WITH JOYCE AND HER FAMILY WHICH MEANS THAT ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE WRONG WITH THE REPORT JOYCE SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN THE PERSON TO WRITE IT IN THE FIRST PLACE
POD1000000044_S0000183	SHE WAS LIKE THE ONE PERSON IN MY LIFE AS A KID WHO COULD HAVE SAID HEY I THINK YOU'RE COACHING HER AND THIS ISN'T RIGHT
POD1000000044_S0000184	WHY ARE WE GOING TO TRY AND SPLIT THESE KIDS UP SHE WAS THE ONE WHO COULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING
POD1000000044_S0000185	IN NINETEEN SEVENTY JOYCE RECOMMENDED THAT MY SISTER GO WITH MY FATHER AND THAT I GO WITH MY MOTHER AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED
POD1000000044_S0000187	AND THAT DICTATED THE COURSE OF MY LIFE WHAT HAPPENED
POD1000000044_S0000189	THIS IS THE QUESTION THAT'S BEEN NAGGING AT JOHN AND RACHEL SINCE THEY FOUND THE REPORT HOW COULD THIS HAVE HAPPENED AND SO JOHN AND RACHEL WANT TO FIND JOYCE AND ASK HER
POD1000000044_S0000190	WHAT I DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND THOUGH IS WHAT I HAVE TO OFFER RACHEL AND JOHN ARE BOTH PRACTICING THERAPIST THEMSELVES THEY'RE MORE THAN CAPABLE OF POSING DIFFICULT QUESTIONS
POD1000000044_S0000191	AND ALTHOUGH I PLAY A MENTAL HEALTH SEMI PROFESSIONAL SEMI CONVINCINGLY ON A PODCAST I'M NOT ACTUALLY ONE AT ALL WHAT WHAT CAN I DO
POD1000000044_S0000192	WELL SO I HAVE HAD TO ADVOCATE FOR MYSELF MY ENTIRE LIFE FROM A VERY YOUNG AGE AND NOBODY ADVOCATED FOR ME OR MY BROTHER
POD1000000044_S0000193	AND SO IF YOU COULD HELP ME WITH THIS IT WOULD BE A HEALING PIECE FOR ME THAT SOMEBODY ELSE ADVOCATED FOR ME

POD1000000044_S0000236	THE VIDEO IS A PART OF A SERIES PRODUCED BY THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION INTENDED TO SHOWCASE PRESTIGIOUS PSYCHOLOGISTS IN SESSION THE WAY THE SERIES WORKS IS THAT FOR PRIVACY REASONS THE PATIENTS ARE PORTRAYED BY ACTORS
POD1000000044_S0000237	AS THE CREDITS ROLL I LEARNED THAT WHILE ALVIN THE THERAPIST IS ALVIN THE THERAPIST TED THE PATIENT IS ACTUALLY BOB THE ACTOR
POD1000000044_S0000238	IT WAS A QUICK SHOOT THERE WASN'T A REHEARSAL PER SAY WE JUST KIND OF WENT IN AND IMPROVISED
POD1000000044_S0000239	THIS IS BOB AND PERFORMANCE WISE BOB HAS DONE IT ALL
POD1000000044_S0000240	JUGGLED SWORDS CRACKED WHIPS EATEN FIRE ON FOR TEN YEARS I DID A STAGE HYPNOSIS SHOW
POD1000000044_S0000241	BOB IS A REGULAR RENAISSANCE MAN IN THAT HE ALSO WORKED AT A RENAISSANCE FAIR WHEN BOB SHOWED UP TO FILM THAT DAY HE WAS ASKED TO IMPROVISE SOME SORT OF MARITAL PROBLEM THAT ALVIN COULD HELP SOLVE BY BRINGING HIS METHOD TO BEAR
POD1000000044_S0000242	I ASKED BOB IF HE FOUND ALVIN'S BEHAVIOR DOMINEERING BUT BOB DOESN'T RECALL MUCH THERE IS ONE THING THOUGH THAT BOB DOES STILL RECALL EVEN THIRTEEN YEARS LATER IT SEEMS BOB WASN'T ALVIN'S FIRST CHOICE OF PATIENT
POD1000000044_S0000243	HE HAD HAD SOMEONE ELSE DO IT BEFORE I THINK WAS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN LADY AND IT DIDN'T GO THE WAY IT NEEDED TO YOU KNOW I MEAN
POD1000000044_S0000244	CAN YOU ELABORATE
POD1000000044_S0000245	HE SHOWED IT TO ME BRIEFLY
POD1000000044_S0000246	BOB DESCRIBES THE VIDEO ALVIN SHOWED HIM BEFORE THEY STARTED FILMING THAT DAY IN IT THE SETUP WAS THE SAME AS IT WAS FOR BOB SHOOT ALVIN WAS IN AN ARMCHAIR HIS LEGS UP ON AN OTTOMAN EXCEPT THIS TIME
POD1000000044_S0000247	IN THE ARMCHAIR BESIDE HIM WAS THE ACTRESS LIKE BOB THE ACTRESS IN THE VIDEO HAD BEEN ASKED TO COME UP WITH A MARRIAGE PROBLEM BUT IN DOING SO THE ACTRESS WENT TO A DARKER PLACE THAN ALVIN ANTICIPATED DESCRIBING A HUSBAND WHO WAS VICIOUS AND CRUEL
POD1000000044_S0000248	NONETHELESS ALVIN TRIED TO OFFER COUNSEL
POD1000000044_S0000249	HE WAS SAYING THINGS LIKE WHEN HE BEHAVES IN THIS WAY CAN YOU BE PLAYFUL ABOUT IT AND THE ACTOR SAID THINGS LIKE WHEN HE CALLS ME NAMES SUGGESTING THAT HE MIGHT BE IN SOME WAYS BORDERLINE AT THE VERY LEAST VERBALLY ABUSIVE
POD1000000044_S0000250	IT SEEMED THERE WAS THE WAY THE ACTRESS WAS GIVEN TO TALKING ABOUT AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP AND THEN THERE WAS THE WAY THAT ALVIN PREFERRED HER TO TALK ABOUT ONE AND SO THE ACTRESS WAS REPLACED AND BOB WAS SHOWN HER VIDEO TO ILLUSTRATE WHAT ALVIN DID NOT WANT
POD1000000044_S0000251	IT'S YOU KNOW I GOT THE MESSAGE I GUESS

POD1000000044_S0000413	AND WE DID THAT FOR A WHILE AND THEN THEY DECIDED THAT IT WASN'T APPROPRIATE TO HAVE A SOCIAL WORKER IN THE PRACTICE SO THEY ASKED ME TO LEAVE
POD1000000044_S0000414	AND IT WAS AT AL'S INSTANT INSTIGATION
POD1000000044_S0000416	WHAT HE SAID TO ME WAS IT'S NOT THAT YOU'RE INCOMPETENT
POD1000000044_S0000417	IT'S JUST THAT I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU'RE COMPETENT
POD1000000044_S0000419	AND YOU KNOW FOR ME TO REMEMBER THIS FIFTY YEARS LATER SAYS A LOT DOESN'T

POD1000000044_S0000432	YOU KNOW I THINK MY DAD WAS SO CONTROLLING

POD1000000044_S0000446	REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME THAT OTHERS JUST OWN AND ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR ROLE IN IN ANY DYNAMIC
POD1000000044_S0000447	ANY INTERACTION IF THEY DO THAT I'M GOOD AND I'LL NEVER
POD1000000044_S0000449	I TRIED IN DIFFERENT WAYS
POD1000000044_S0000450	HE WOULD NEVER OWN ANY CULPABILITY RESPONSIBILITY ANYTHING
POD1000000044_S0000451	WHEN JOHN FIRST BECAME A PSYCHOLOGIST HE'D SEE ALVIN AT VARIOUS CONFERENCES WHERE ALVIN WAS RECEIVED AS A STAR
POD1000000044_S0000452	FOR JOHN IT ALWAYS OCCASIONED A WEIRD MIX OF PRIDE IN HIS FATHER'S CAREER AND BITTERNESS OVER HIS PERSONAL REJECTION
POD1000000044_S0000453	AT ONE CONFERENCE JOHN ATTENDED ALVIN'S LECTURE IN THE HOPE OF FORCING HIS FATHER TO TALK TO HIM
POD1000000044_S0000454	ALVIN SAW JOHN IN THE AUDIENCE BUT AFTERWARDS MADE HIM WAIT ONLINE ALONG WITH ALL HIS ADORING FANS EVENTUALLY JOHN GREW FRUSTRATED AND LEFT
POD1000000044_S0000455	IT'S ONE OF THE MYSTERIES OF MY LIFE HOW HE JUSTIFIED OR RATIONALIZED TO HIMSELF YOU KNOW HAVING A SON AND AND SUPPOSEDLY LOVING HIM
POD1000000044_S0000456	AND THEN JUST CUTTING HIM OFF AND REJECTING HIM FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE I DON'T I CAN'T FATHOM THAT AT ALL
POD1000000044_S0000458	THERE WAS AN EMAIL EXCHANGE OVER SEVEN OR EIGHT MONTHS WHERE I ENDEAVOURED TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION THAT LIFELONG QUESTION OF YOU KNOW WHY
POD1000000044_S0000459	AND HE JUST KEPT TRYING TO SELL ME HIS BOOKS AND YOU KNOW BECAME THIS REFRAIN HAVE YOU READ MY BOOK HAVE YOU READ MY BOOK AND I'D SAY IF YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO READ YOUR BOOK
POD1000000044_S0000460	SEND ME A COPY AND I WILL READ IT NO HE WANTS ME TO BUY A BOOK HE WANTED ME TO BUY A BOOK
POD1000000044_S0000462	IN HIS EMAILS TO JOHN ALVIN WROTE THAT IT WAS A SOPHOMORIC MYTH THAT A PARENT SHOULD SEEK RELATIONSHIPS WITH ONE'S CHILD I DO NOT ACCEPT SILLY POP PSYCHOLOGY TRUISMS HE WROTE
POD1000000044_S0000463	NEAR THE END OF ALVIN'S LIFE JOHN WANTED TO MAKE ONE LAST EFFORT TO SEE HIS FATHER SO ALVIN COULD MEET HIS GRANDKIDS
POD1000000044_S0000464	BUT RACHEL COUNSELED JOHN NOT TO GO SHE SAID THAT ALVIN WOULD REFUSE TO SEE HIM AND WAS STILL SO FULL OF ANGER THAT HE MIGHT EVEN CALL THE POLICE
POD1000000044_S0000465	AFTER HIS DEATH ALVIN LEFT BEHIND WILL WITH A SECTION LISTING THE NAMES OF THOSE WHO WRONGED HIM EACH PERSON WAS TO RECEIVE A SINGLE DOLLAR AMONG THEM WAS JOHN
POD1000000044_S0000466	BACK WHEN I SPOKE TO AL'S DISCIPLE HOWARD HE TOLD ME THAT ALL WAS BEDRIDDEN AT THE END OF HIS LIFE YET HE WAS STILL FOCUSED ON HIS THERAPEUTIC METHOD
POD1000000044_S0000467	JUST BEFORE HE PASSED AWAY WHEN I VISITED HIM HE SAID HOWARD I'M WORKING ON BECOMING MORE OF AN OPTIMAL PERSON I'M JUST DOING IT NOW AND HE WAS LIKE SO ENERGETIC
POD1000000044_S0000468	AND DO YOU DO YOU
POD1000000044_S0000469	FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE I MEAN DID HE ACHIEVE THAT KIND OF LIKE OPTIMAL PERSONHOOD
POD1000000044_S0000471	HE SAID HE HAD
POD1000000044_S0000473	RAISED THE SUBJECT OF ALVIN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS KIDS AND HOW THAT CONNECTED TO HIS OPTIMAL SELF HOWARD SAYS HE CAN'T REALLY SPEAK TO THAT ALVIN DIDN'T BRING UP HIS KIDS MUCH
POD1000000044_S0000474	THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF THAT GOES ON SOMETIMES GOOD AND BAD AND YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST WHAT HAPPENS IN LIFE WE LIVE AND WE ADJUST AND DO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO
POD1000000044_S0000475	BUT I DON'T THINK WHATEVER HAPPENS AT A CERTAIN POINT IN SOMEONE'S LIFE SHOULD DEFINE THEM FOR WHO THEY ARE AS A PERSON OVERALL

POD1000000045_S0000132	SO THE STORY BOUNCES BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE SEVENTEEN HUNDREDS AND THEN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WHERE SOMEBODY REMEMBERS HER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER THREE HUNDRED YEARS OF LIFE
POD1000000045_S0000133	SO THAT'S WHERE OUR STORY BOUNCES OFF FROM THERE AND I JUST LOVED IT THE WRITING IS ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS THE EXPERIENCES THAT SHE HAS I'M SURE YOU CAN IMAGINE THEY MAKE FOR SOME REALLY INTERESTING YOU KNOW MEETINGS WITH PEOPLE

POD1000000045_S0000278	WOW OH MY GOSH OKAY
POD1000000045_S0000279	HER BASIC PREMISE IS THAT THE WAY THE UNITED STATES HAS SEPARATED ITSELF OUT BY RACE SHE CALLS IT A CASTE SYSTEM AND SHE KIND OF COMPARES IT TO INDIA'S CAST SYSTEM AND ALSO NAZI GERMANY'S CAST SYSTEM
POD1000000045_S0000280	SHE BRINGS IN SIMILARITIES AND ALSO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO AND THEN SHE TALKS ABOUT THE HISTORY OF RACISM IN THE UNITED STATES AND HOW IT HAS EVOLVED FROM SLAVERY TO MASS INCARCERATION AND THEN NOW TO WHERE WE ARE WITH ALL OF THE ISSUES

POD1000000045_S0000288	HEY SOME OF US THAT IS STILL THE CASE IN ADULTHOOD SOME OF US WOULD MAYBE RATHER JUST TURN ON NETFLIX AND SEE WHAT'S ON INSTEAD OF READING I'M WONDERING IF YOU HAVE A FEW PICKS FOR A READER THAT THEY COULD JUST PICK UP AND NOT BE ABLE TO PUT DOWN
POD1000000045_S0000289	SURE SO WHEN I WAS TEACHING FOURTH GRADE WHEN I HAD RELUCTANT READERS MY GO TO WAS LIKE TO HAND THEM A GRAPHIC NOVEL BECAUSE GRAPHIC NOVELS ARE SO FUN AND I REALLY LOVE THEM AS AN ADULT TOO I LOVE TO LOOK THROUGH THE PICTURES AND READ THE STORY

POD1000000045_S0000296	BUT IF GRAPHIC NOVELS AREN'T YOUR THING SOMETHING THAT I LOVE TO DO WHEN I'M FEELING A LITTLE BIT LIKE OH I WANT TO READ I PICK UP A FANTASY BECAUSE FANTASIES ARE SO FUN AND THEY USUALLY HAVE A SERIES TO GO WITH THEM AND YOU CAN READ LIKE FIVE IN A ROW
POD1000000045_S0000297	THIS ONE ONLY HAS TWO AND IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A FANTASY BUT IT'S AN ALTERNATE HISTORY SO THE FIRST ONE IS CALLED DREAD NATION AND THE AUTHOR IS JUSTINA IRELAND
POD1000000045_S0000298	SO THE ALTERNATE HISTORY IS THAT THE CIVIL WAR HAD TO PAUSE BECAUSE ZOMBIES YES ZOMBIES WERE TAKING OVER

POD1000000045_S0000345	OKAY KATIE TWENTY TWENTY IT'S BEEN A ROUGH YEAR BUT YOU HAD A BIG LIFE MOMENT HAPPEN WHEN YOU PUBLISHED YOUR FIRST BOOK IT'S CALLED MY STORIED YEAR
POD1000000045_S0000346	SO LET'S SEE WHERE SHOULD WE EVEN START I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR KIND OF WHERE DID THE STORY COME TO YOU FIRST OF ALL GIVE US A LITTLE SNAPSHOT OF WHAT MY STORY YEAR IS ABOUT
POD1000000045_S0000347	AND THEN MAYBE TELL US THE STORY OF HOW DID THIS STORY COME INTO YOUR LIFE INTO YOUR MIND WALK US THROUGH A LITTLE BIT OF HOW THE PROCESS WAS FROM TAKING IT FROM LIKE OH I HAVE THIS IDEA TO NOW YOU CAN HOLD IT IN YOUR HANDS YOU WROTE A BOOK YOU'RE AN AUTHOR TELL US EVERYTHING
POD1000000045_S0000348	OKAY SO MY STORY YOUR STARTS WITH DRAGON STUART HE'S A SEVENTH GRADER AND HE IS DYSLEXIC AND HE HAS A REALLY HARD LIFE AT HOME AND HE'S GOT SOME BULLYING SITUATIONS GOING ON AT SCHOOL
POD1000000045_S0000349	BUT THIS YEAR HE HAS A NEW SET OF TEACHERS AND SOME NEW KIDS IN HIS CLASS AND HIS ENGLISH TEACHER WHO IS MY FAVORITE REALLY KIND OF PULLS OUT THE WRITER IN HIM HE'S LIKE A SECRET POET HE HAS THIS JOURNAL THAT HE CARRIES AROUND AND WRITES POETRY
POD1000000045_S0000350	BUT OTHERWISE DOESN'T REALLY LIKE TO READ OR WRITE BECAUSE IT'S HARD FOR HIM AND HE HAS KIND OF THE SECRET STORY THAT HE DOESN'T REALLY KNOW IF HE SHOULD TELL IT OR HOW HE SHOULD TELL IT AND SO
POD1000000045_S0000351	THROUGH THE YEAR HE KIND OF OPENS UP TO HIS FRIENDS MORE AND THEN HE'S ABLE TO KIND OF REVEAL HIS STORY AND SO THAT'S THE BASIC PREMISE OF IT
POD1000000045_S0000352	OH MY GOODNESS YOU HAVE SENT A COPY IT'S ON THE WAY TO ME I CANNOT WAIT AGAIN I LOVE LOVE LOVE MIDDLE GRADE NOVELS AND THIS JUST FEELS SO HEARTWARMING ALREADY JUST HEARING YOU SET UP THE STORY
POD1000000045_S0000353	YOU'VE MENTIONED THAT YOU TAUGHT ELEMENTARY WAS THAT KIND OF A JUMPING OFF POINT FOR YOU IN TERMS OF HOW THIS CHARACTER CAME INTO YOUR MIND
POD1000000045_S0000355	SO WHEN I TAUGHT WRITING WAS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE THING TO TEACH I DID A LOT OF EXTENSIVE TRAINING ON WRITING AND A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT SHE DOES IN THE BOOK THERE'S KIND OF LIKE LITTLE WRITING LESSONS ALONG THE WAY THAT YOU COULD DO WITH YOUR KIDS IF YOU WERE HOMESCHOOLING THEM OR EVEN TEACHERS IN A CLASSROOM
POD1000000045_S0000356	BUT A LOT OF THOSE THINGS I LEARNED THROUGH MY TRAININGS AND SO I WANTED TO PULL IN LIKE THE WHOLE WRITING IS THERAPY ALMOST FOR PEOPLE YOU KNOW HOW WE PUT THINGS INTO WORDS AND HOW OUR CREATIVITY KIND OF FIND OUT WHO WE ARE AND SO
POD1000000045_S0000357	I WANTED TO PULL IN THAT ASPECT OF IT AND DRAGON IS REALLY KIND OF A MIXTURE OF A LOT OF KIDS THAT I TAUGHT YOU KNOW I HAD SOME HARD KIDS YOU'RE GONNA TEACH FOR ANY AMOUNT OF TIME YOU'RE GONNA HAVE SOME KIDS WITH SOME HARD LIVES AND SO
POD1000000045_S0000358	HE'S A MIXTURE OF A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT ONES AND I JUST AT THE BEGINNING OF MY TEACHING I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THESE KIDS BECAUSE THAT WASN'T MY LIFE EXPERIENCE I GREW UP IN A TWO PARENT HOUSEHOLD AND
POD1000000045_S0000359	YOU KNOW WE WERE ALWAYS FINANCIALLY STABLE AND SO I DIDN'T STRUGGLE LIKE THAT AND SO WHEN I MET THESE KIDS IT WAS ALMOST LIKE I CAN'T BELIEVE PEOPLE LIKE THIS EXIST YOU KNOW I DIDN'T HAVE THAT CONTEXT AND SO
POD1000000045_S0000360	I LEARNED OVER THE COURSE OF MY YEARS HOW TO HELP YOU KNOW THESE KIDS GET THROUGH THEIR DAILY LIVES AND HOW TO DO THINGS TO HELP THEM AND I WISH I HAD DONE MORE LOOKING BACK YOU KNOW YOU ALWAYS
POD1000000045_S0000362	
POD1000000045_S0000363	BUT DRAGON IS JUST A MIXTURE OF ALL THOSE KIDS SO I WANTED KIDS TO BE ABLE TO SEE THAT KIDS LIKE THIS ARE REAL AND THAT THEY DO HAVE REAL PROBLEMS AND HOW YOU KNOW
POD1000000045_S0000364	THEY NEED SUPPORT AT SCHOOL FROM THEIR FRIENDS FROM THEIR TEACHERS I WANTED TO WRITE IT FOR TEACHERS TO SEE HOW YOU KNOW THEY CAN BE SO IMPORTANT IN THESE KIDS' LIVES ESPECIALLY IF THEIR HOME LIFE IS NOT STABLE
POD1000000045_S0000365	THEIR TEACHER MIGHT BE THEIR ONE ADULT THAT LOVES THEM AND SO I WANTED TO PUT THAT IN THE BOOK TOO
POD1000000045_S0000366	YES YEAH THAT IS SO TRUE I MEAN TEACHERS CAN HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON OUR LIVES SOMETIMES NOT EVEN IN A GOOD WAY BUT DEFINITELY IN POSITIVE WAYS
POD1000000045_S0000367	AND I THINK THAT CAN HAPPEN AT ANY POINT ALONG OUR JOURNEY BUT I THINK THOSE MIDDLE GRADE YEARS ARE SO TENDER AND SO FORMATIVE AND
POD1000000045_S0000368	WHEN YOU HAVE A TEACHER IN YOUR LIFE THAT REALLY SEES YOU AND IS REALLY ABLE TO HELP YOU TO DISCOVER WHO YOU ARE THAT IS ABSOLUTELY AN ACTUAL LIFE CHANGER SO
POD1000000045_S0000369	YEAH WHAT A GREAT CONTEXT TO SET THE STORY IN AS YOU HAVE THIS IDEA AND SO IT'S OBVIOUSLY GOING TO BE FICTION IN THE FICTION WRITING PROCESS AND MAYBE THIS EVEN DIFFERS DEPENDING ON IF YOU'RE WRITING CHILDREN'S MIDDLE GRADE OR OR ADULT
POD1000000045_S0000370	DO YOU FULLY WRITE THE BOOK AND THEN START TO GO TO AGENTS OR PUBLISHERS AND SAY OKAY I HAVE THIS THING OR DO YOU TALK ON THE PUBLISHING IN FIRST AND THEN GO AND WRITE LIKE WHAT WAS THAT PROCESS LIKE FOR YOU
POD1000000045_S0000371	SO IT'S DIFFERENT FOR FICTION AND NONFICTION WHICH I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW UNTIL I HAD KIND OF GONE THROUGH IT BUT WHAT HAPPENED WAS I WROTE AND IT WASN'T EVEN THIS BOOK THAT I WROTE I WROTE ANOTHER MANUSCRIPT
POD1000000045_S0000372	THERE'S A HUGE WRITING CONFERENCE IN DALLAS FORT WORTH CALLED DFW CAN AND IT'S A BIG WRITING CONFERENCE AND
POD1000000045_S0000373	WITH YOUR CONFERENCE TICKET YOU GET TEN MINUTES WITH A LITERARY AGENT TO PITCH YOUR WORK AT THAT POINT I HAD FINISHED MANUSCRIPT AND WHEN I WAS KIND OF RESEARCHING THE CONFERENCE FOR FICTION THEY WANT YOU TO HAVE A COMPLETE MANUSCRIPT
POD1000000045_S0000374	BEFORE YOU EVER CONTACT ANYBODY FOR NONFICTION IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN SELL THE BOOK BEFORE YOU GO LIKE WRITE ALL OF IT THEY SEE IF YOU HAVE A PLATFORM AND YOU WRITE A PROPOSAL AND ALL THAT STUFF BUT THE BOOK DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE DONE
POD1000000045_S0000375	FOR FICTION GENERALLY THEY WANT YOU TO HAVE A COMPLETE MANUSCRIPT BEFORE YOU START PITCHING IT TO ANYBODY SO I SAT DOWN WITH THIS AGENT I KIND OF GAVE HER MY ELEVATOR PITCH ABOUT THE BOOK
POD1000000045_S0000376	AND THEN SHE ASKED ME TO SEND HER THE FULL MANUSCRIPT WHICH IS KIND OF THE BEST THING THAT YOU CAN HEAR AT A CONFERENCE BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE WILL SAY I'LL PASS ON THIS OR SEND ME FIVE PAGES OR WHATEVER SHE ASKED FOR THE FULL THING
POD1000000045_S0000377	SO I SENT IT TO HER AND THEN YOU KNOW SIX EIGHT TEN MONTHS LATER SHE GOT I MEAN IT'S A LONG WAITING PROCESS
POD1000000045_S0000378	BECAUSE THEY HAVE SO MANY MANUSCRIPTS THAT ARE COMING INTO THEM AND THEY HAVE TO READ THEM AND THIS WOMAN ACTUALLY ENDED UP BEING MY AGENT AND I'M SO GRATEFUL FOR HER BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T JUST SEND BACK LIKE I DON'T WANT THIS
POD1000000045_S0000379	SHE SENT BACK A LIST OF REALLY HELPFUL NOTES FOR REVISIONS AND SHE SAID IF YOU WANT TO LIKE REVISE AND THEN RESUBMIT I'LL BE HAPPY TO LOOK AT IT AGAIN SHE WAS LIKE I DON'T THINK WE CAN SELL IT AS IT IS RIGHT NOW BUT I'LL BE HAPPY TO LOOK AT IT AGAIN
POD1000000045_S0000380	SO I TOOK HER NOTES DID A LOT OF THINGS WORKED WITH THE PROFESSIONAL EDITOR AND THEN SENT IT BACK TO HER AND THEN SHE AGREED TO REPRESENT ME SO THAT'S KIND OF HOW THAT SITUATION WENT BUT THAT WAS LIKE A YEAR LONG PROCESS PROBABLY FROM START TO FINISH
POD1000000045_S0000381	AND THEN ONCE SHE HAS IT I STILL WENT BACK AND REWROTE IT PROBABLY TWO OR THREE TIMES NOT A MAJOR RE HAUL BUT JUST LIKE THESE PARTS NEED TO BE FIXED
POD1000000045_S0000382	AND THEN SHE STARTED TO SHOP IT TO PUBLISHERS SO SHE DID THE SAME THING I DID TO FIND AN AGENT SHE HAD TO SEND OUT YOU KNOW LETTERS AND SAMPLES AND ALL THAT STUFF TO DIFFERENT PUBLISHERS UNTIL WE FOUND ONE
POD1000000045_S0000383	MY PUBLISHING JOURNEY IS KIND OF LIKE WACKY BECAUSE MY PUBLISHER BOUGHT THE FIRST BOOK THAT I WROTE BUT THEN THEY SAID WHAT ELSE DOES SHE HAVE SO WE SENT HER MY STORY YEAR
POD1000000045_S0000384	AND THEN THEY WERE LIKE WE WANT TO PUBLISH THIS ONE FIRST THEY FELT LIKE IT WAS REALLY TIMELY AND THEY WANTED TO GET IT OUT THERE
POD1000000045_S0000386	FIRST AND THEN THE FIRST BOOK THAT I SOLD WILL ACTUALLY COME OUT IN JUNE SO THAT'S LIKE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT BOOK BUT THEY WANTED TO GET THIS ONE
POD1000000045_S0000387	IS IT A MIDDLE GRADE NOVEL TO
POD1000000045_S0000388	IT'S ALSO MIDDLE GRADE AND IT'S HISTORICAL FICTION SO IT'S TOTALLY LIKE ON A DIFFERENT LEVEL THAN THIS ONE BUT
POD1000000045_S0000389	THAT IS FASCINATING I MEAN YOU SAY THAT THE TIMELINE WAS A LITTLE WACKY BUT IF I'VE LEARNED ANYTHING FROM MY FRIENDS WHO ARE AUTHORS IT'S THAT LIKE THE TIMELINES ALWAYS CRAZY LIKE EVERYTHING TAKES SO LONG
POD1000000045_S0000390	AND THEN SOMETIMES YOU WRITE THE LIKE I'VE HAD FRIENDS WHO ARE NONFICTION AUTHORS WHO WRITE THE WHOLE THING SUBMIT IT AND THEN THE PUBLISHER IS LIKE YEAH NO WE DON'T WANT TO DO THIS AFTER ALL I MEAN THERE'S ALWAYS LIKE SO MANY TWISTS AND TURNS ON THE PUBLISHING JOURNEY
POD1000000045_S0000391	SO I CAN ONLY IMAGINE YEAH THAT EVERY SINGLE ONE I'M SURE HAS SURPRISES ALONG THE WAY SOME MAYBE ARE NOT SO HAPPY SURPRISES BUT WHAT HAS SURPRISED YOU IN A WAY THAT YOU REALLY LIKE THIS WAS A HAPPY SURPRISE ABOUT THE PUBLISHING PROCESS
POD1000000045_S0000392	THE THING THAT SURPRISED ME THE MOST I WASN'T REALLY HAPPY WAS HOW LONG IT TOOK BECAUSE YOU KNOW LIKE I'M LIKE I WROTE THIS BOOK AND LET'S GET IT OUT I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW LONG OF A PROCESS IT IS FROM LIKE GETTING IT FROM A RAW DRAFT TO AN ACTUAL BOOK
POD1000000045_S0000393	BUT I THINK THE THING THAT SURPRISED ME IN THE BEST WAY IS THAT I HAVE JUST MET SO MANY GOOD PEOPLE THAT LIKE MY EDITOR IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE PEOPLE SHE IS GRACIOUS BUT SHE'S TOUGH AND SHE'S YOU KNOW CUT THIS YOU KNOW
POD1000000045_S0000394	LET'S FIX THIS PART BECAUSE IT'S NOT QUITE WORKING AND I'VE JUST LEARNED A LOT ABOUT MYSELF AS A WRITER AND ABOUT GOOD WRITING AND SO THAT'S BEEN REALLY REALLY GOOD
POD1000000045_S0000395	I ALSO WANT TO ENCOURAGE ANYBODY WHO'S WRITING TO FIND YOURSELF A WRITING GROUP AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SOMEONE YOU MEET WITH LIKE MY WRITING GROUP I FOUND FROM SORTA AWESOME WE'RE IN THE SORTA AWESOME RIDERS
POD1000000045_S0000396	SPIN OFF GROUP AND SOMEONE WAS BRAVE ENOUGH AND JUST SAID HEY WHO WANTS TO BE IN A WRITING GROUP AND SO WE'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE LIKE I'M IN TEXAS AND THERE'S ONE IN NEW YORK AND ONE IN LEBANON AND ONE IN YOU KNOW CONNECTICUT

YOU1000000001_S0000005	SO WHAT I'VE DONE AT THIS POINT AND THIS IS THE EASIEST WAY TO PUT YOUR CAMERA ON THE SITE IS I'VE DRIVEN PAST THE SITE AND I'VE GOT THE SITE ON THE DRIVER SIDE OF THE TRUCK
YOU1000000001_S0000006	I DO THAT ON PURPOSE SO I CAN SEE WHERE THE SLIDE SIDE OR THE OFF DOOR SIDE OF THE CAMPER IS GOING
YOU1000000001_S0000007	THAT'S THE SIDE THAT WE WANT TO KEEP AS FAR THIS WAY AS POSSIBLE TO GIVE US MORE REAL ESTATE ON THE USABLE PART OF OUR SITE
YOU1000000001_S0000008	IF YOU CAN ALL DO THAT WHEN YOU PULL UP TO YOUR CAMPSITE TRY TO KEEP THE DRIVER'S SIDE ON THE ON THE SITE SIDE NOT ALL THE TIME YOU'LL BE ABLE TO DO THAT BUT IF YOU CAN THAT'S DEFINITELY GONNA WORK IN YOUR BENEFIT

YOU1000000001_S0000014	NOW VERY IMPORTANT AT THIS POINT IS REMEMBERING THAT OUR WHEELS ARE THE PIVOT POINT FOR OUR CAMPER SO THAT'S WHERE THE CAMPER IS GOING TO TURN
YOU1000000001_S0000015	I DON'T WANT TO WATCH THE FRONT OF THE CAMP OR THE BACK SO MUCH I WANT TO KEEP MY EYES ON THE WHEELS SO HERE WE GO
YOU1000000001_S0000016	AND SOMETIMES WHEN I'M DRIVING A DIFFERENT TRUCK THIS TRUCK'S WORKING OUT PRETTY WELL BUT SOMETIMES I'LL EVEN ANGLE THE MIRROR DOWN SO I CAN SEE THE WHEELS A LITTLE BIT BETTER

YOU1000000001_S0000029	YOU ALWAYS CAN PUT THE TRUCK BACK AND DRIVE AND PULL FORWARD AND STRAIGHTEN THE TRAILER
YOU1000000001_S0000030	IF YOU'VE GONE TOO FAR TOO FAR PAST AND THE CAMPER'S GOING THE WRONG WAY OR THE BACK END OF THE CAMPER IS GONE TOO FAR THE WAY YOU DON'T WANT IT TO GO

YOU1000000001_S0000069	SO THANKS AGAIN FOR WATCHING AND HAPPY CAMPING
YOU1000000003_S0000001	THIS IS A THREE IT'S SLOPPILY WRITTEN AND RENDERED AT AN EXTREMELY LOW RESOLUTION OF TWENTY EIGHT BY TWENTY EIGHT PIXELS
YOU1000000003_S0000002	BUT YOUR BRAIN HAS NO TROUBLE RECOGNIZING IT AS A THREE
YOU1000000003_S0000003	AND I WANT YOU TO TAKE A MOMENT TO APPRECIATE HOW CRAZY IT IS THAT BRAINS CAN DO THIS SO EFFORTLESSLY
YOU1000000003_S0000004	I MEAN THIS THIS AND THIS ARE ALSO RECOGNIZABLE AS THREES
YOU1000000003_S0000005	EVEN THOUGH THE SPECIFIC VALUES OF EACH PIXEL IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM ONE IMAGE TO THE NEXT
YOU1000000003_S0000006	THE PARTICULAR LIGHT SENSITIVE CELLS IN YOUR EYE THAT ARE FIRING WHEN YOU SEE THIS THREE ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE ONES FIRING WHEN YOU SEE THIS THREE
YOU1000000003_S0000007	BUT SOMETHING IN THAT CRAZY SMART VISUAL CORTEX OF YOURS RESOLVES THESE AS REPRESENTING THE SAME IDEA
YOU1000000003_S0000008	WHILE AT THE SAME TIME RECOGNIZING OTHER IMAGES AS THEIR OWN DISTINCT IDEAS
YOU1000000003_S0000009	BUT IF I TOLD YOU HEY SIT DOWN AND WRITE FOR ME A PROGRAM THAT TAKES IN A GRID OF TWENTY EIGHT BY TWENTY EIGHT PIXELS LIKE THIS
YOU1000000003_S0000010	AND OUTPUTS A SINGLE NUMBER BETWEEN ZERO AND TEN TELLING YOU WHAT IT THINKS THE DIGIT IS
YOU1000000003_S0000011	WELL THE TASK GOES FROM COMICALLY TRIVIAL TO DAUNTINGLY DIFFICULT
YOU1000000003_S0000012	UNLESS YOU'VE BEEN LIVING UNDER A ROCK I THINK I HARDLY NEED TO MOTIVATE THE RELEVANCE AND IMPORTANCE OF MACHINE LEARNING AND NEURAL NETWORKS
YOU1000000003_S0000013	THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE BUT WHAT I WANT TO DO HERE IS SHOW YOU WHAT A NEURAL NETWORK ACTUALLY IS
YOU1000000003_S0000014	ASSUMING NO BACKGROUND AND TO HELP VISUALIZE WHAT IT'S DOING NOT AS A BUZZWORD BUT AS A PIECE OF MATH
YOU1000000003_S0000015	MY HOPE IS JUST THAT YOU COME AWAY FEELING LIKE THE STRUCTURE ITSELF IS MOTIVATED
YOU1000000003_S0000016	AND TO FEEL LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS WHEN YOU READ OR YOU HEAR ABOUT A NEURAL NETWORK QUOTE UNQUOTE LEARNING
YOU1000000003_S0000017	THIS VIDEO IS JUST GOING TO BE DEVOTED TO THE STRUCTURE COMPONENT OF THAT AND THE FOLLOWING ONE IS GOING TO TACKLE LEARNING
YOU1000000003_S0000018	WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS PUT TOGETHER A NEURAL NETWORK THAT CAN LEARN TO RECOGNIZE HANDWRITTEN DIGITS
YOU1000000003_S0000020	THIS IS A SOMEWHAT CLASSIC EXAMPLE FOR INTRODUCING THE TOPIC
YOU1000000003_S0000021	AND I'M HAPPY TO STICK WITH THE STATUS QUO HERE BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE TWO VIDEOS I WANT TO POINT YOU TO A COUPLE GOOD RESOURCES WHERE YOU CAN LEARN MORE
YOU1000000003_S0000022	AND WHERE YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THE CODE THAT DOES THIS AND PLAY WITH IT ON YOUR OWN COMPUTER
YOU1000000003_S0000024	THERE ARE MANY MANY VARIANTS OF NEURAL NETWORKS AND IN RECENT YEARS THERE'S BEEN SORT OF A BOOM IN RESEARCH TOWARDS THESE VARIANTS
YOU1000000003_S0000025	BUT IN THESE TWO INTRODUCTORY VIDEOS YOU AND I ARE JUST GOING TO LOOK AT THE SIMPLEST PLAIN VANILLA FORM WITH NO ADDED FRILLS
YOU1000000003_S0000026	THIS IS KIND OF A NECESSARY PREREQUISITE FOR UNDERSTANDING ANY OF THE MORE POWERFUL MODERN VARIANTS
YOU1000000003_S0000027	AND TRUST ME IT STILL HAS PLENTY OF COMPLEXITY FOR US TO WRAP OUR MINDS AROUND
YOU1000000003_S0000028	BUT EVEN IN THIS SIMPLEST FORM IT CAN LEARN TO RECOGNIZE HANDWRITTEN DIGITS
YOU1000000003_S0000029	WHICH IS A PRETTY COOL THING FOR A COMPUTER TO BE ABLE TO DO
YOU1000000003_S0000031	AT THE SAME TIME YOU'LL SEE HOW IT DOES FALL SHORT OF A COUPLE HOPES THAT WE MIGHT HAVE FOR
YOU1000000003_S0000033	AS THE NAME SUGGESTS NEURAL NETWORKS ARE INSPIRED BY THE BRAIN BUT LET'S BREAK THAT DOWN WHAT ARE THE NEURONS AND IN WHAT SENSE ARE THEY LINKED TOGETHER
YOU1000000003_S0000034	RIGHT NOW WHEN I SAY NEURON ALL I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT IS A THING THAT HOLDS A NUMBER SPECIFICALLY A NUMBER BETWEEN ZERO AND ONE IT'S REALLY NOT MORE THAN THAT
YOU1000000003_S0000036	FOR EXAMPLE THE NETWORK STARTS WITH A BUNCH OF NEURONS CORRESPONDING TO EACH OF THE TWENTY EIGHT TIMES TWENTY EIGHT PIXELS OF THE INPUT IMAGE
YOU1000000003_S0000037	WHICH IS SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR NEURONS IN TOTAL EACH ONE OF THESE HOLDS A NUMBER THAT REPRESENTS THE GRAY SCALE VALUE OF THE CORRESPONDING PIXEL
YOU1000000003_S0000038	RANGING FROM ZERO FOR BLACK PIXELS UP TO ONE FOR WHITE PIXELS THIS NUMBER INSIDE THE NEURON IS CALLED ITS ACTIVATION
YOU1000000003_S0000039	AND THE IMAGE YOU MIGHT HAVE IN MIND HERE IS THAT EACH NEURON IS LIT UP WHEN ITS ACTIVATION IS A HIGH NUMBER
YOU1000000003_S0000041	ALL OF THESE SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR NEURONS MAKE UP THE FIRST LAYER OF OUR NETWORK
YOU1000000003_S0000043	JUMPING OVER TO THE LAST LAYER THIS HAS TEN NEURONS EACH REPRESENTING ONE OF THE DIGITS
YOU1000000003_S0000044	THE ACTIVATION IN THESE NEURONS AGAIN SOME NUMBER THAT'S BETWEEN ZERO AND ONE
YOU1000000003_S0000045	REPRESENTS HOW MUCH THE SYSTEM THINKS THAT A GIVEN IMAGE CORRESPONDS WITH A GIVEN DIGIT
YOU1000000003_S0000046	THERE'S ALSO A COUPLE LAYERS IN BETWEEN CALLED THE HIDDEN LAYERS WHICH FOR THE TIME BEING SHOULD JUST BE A GIANT QUESTION MARK
YOU1000000003_S0000047	HOW ON EARTH THIS PROCESS OF RECOGNIZING DIGITS IS GOING TO BE HANDLED IN THIS NETWORK I CHOSE TWO HIDDEN LAYERS EACH ONE WITH SIXTEEN NEURONS
YOU1000000003_S0000048	AND ADMITTEDLY THAT'S KIND OF AN ARBITRARY CHOICE TO BE HONEST I CHOSE TWO LAYERS BASED ON HOW I WANT TO MOTIVATE THE STRUCTURE IN JUST A MOMENT
YOU1000000003_S0000049	AND SIXTEEN WELL THAT WAS JUST A NICE NUMBER TO FIT ON THE SCREEN IN PRACTICE THERE IS A LOT OF ROOM FOR EXPERIMENT WITH A SPECIFIC STRUCTURE HERE
YOU1000000003_S0000050	THE WAY THE NETWORK OPERATES ACTIVATIONS IN ONE LAYER DETERMINE THE ACTIVATION OF THE NEXT LAYER
YOU1000000003_S0000051	AND OF COURSE THE HEART OF THE NETWORK AS AN INFORMATION PROCESSING MECHANISM COMES DOWN TO EXACTLY HOW THOSE ACTIVATIONS FROM ONE LAYER BRING ABOUT ACTIVATIONS IN THE NEXT LAYER
YOU1000000003_S0000052	IT'S MEANT TO BE LOOSELY ANALOGOUS TO HOW IN BIOLOGICAL NETWORKS OF NEURONS SOME GROUPS OF NEURONS FIRING CAUSED CERTAIN OTHERS TO FIRE
YOU1000000003_S0000053	NOW THE NETWORK I'M SHOWING HERE HAS ALREADY BEEN TRAINED TO RECOGNIZE DIGITS AND LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN BY THAT
YOU1000000003_S0000054	MEANS IF YOU FEED IN AN IMAGE LIGHTING UP ALL SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR NEURONS OF THE INPUT LAYER ACCORDING TO THE BRIGHTNESS OF EACH PIXEL IN THE IMAGE
YOU1000000003_S0000055	THAT PATTERN OF ACTIVATION CAUSES SOME VERY SPECIFIC PATTERN IN THE NEXT LAYER WHICH CAUSES SOME PATTERN IN THE ONE AFTER IT
YOU1000000003_S0000056	WHICH FINALLY GIVES SOME PATTERN IN THE OUTPUT LAYER AND THE BRIGHTEST NEURON OF THAT OUTPUT LAYER IS THE NETWORK'S CHOICE SO TO SPEAK FOR WHAT DIGIT THIS IMAGE REPRESENTS
YOU1000000003_S0000058	AND BEFORE JUMPING INTO THE MATH FOR HOW ONE LAYER INFLUENCES THE NEXT OR HOW TRAINING WORKS
YOU1000000003_S0000059	LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT WHY IT'S EVEN REASONABLE TO EXPECT A LAYERED STRUCTURE LIKE THIS TO BEHAVE INTELLIGENTLY
YOU1000000003_S0000060	WHAT ARE WE EXPECTING HERE WHAT IS THE BEST HOPE FOR WHAT THOSE MIDDLE LAYERS MIGHT BE DOING
YOU1000000003_S0000061	WELL WHEN YOU OR I RECOGNIZE DIGITS WE PIECED TOGETHER VARIOUS COMPONENTS A NINE HAS A LOOP UP TOP AND A LINE ON THE RIGHT
YOU1000000003_S0000062	AN EIGHT ALSO HAS A LOOP UP TOP BUT IT'S PAIRED WITH ANOTHER LOOP DOWN LOW
YOU1000000003_S0000063	A FOUR BASICALLY BREAKS DOWN INTO THREE SPECIFIC LINES AND THINGS LIKE THAT
YOU1000000003_S0000064	NOW IN A PERFECT WORLD WE MIGHT HOPE THAT EACH NEURON IN THE SECOND TO LAST LAYER CORRESPONDS WITH ONE OF THESE SUBCOMPONENTS
YOU1000000003_S0000065	THAT ANYTIME YOU FEED IN AN IMAGE WITH SAY A LOOP UP TOP LIKE A NINE OR AN EIGHT THERE'S SOME SPECIFIC NEURON WHOSE ACTIVATION IS GOING TO BE CLOSE TO ONE
YOU1000000003_S0000066	AND I DON'T MEAN THIS SPECIFIC LOOP OF PIXELS THE HOPE WOULD BE THAT ANY GENERALLY LOOPY PATTERN TOWARDS THE TOP SETS OFF THIS NEURON
YOU1000000003_S0000067	THAT WAY GOING FROM THE THIRD LAYER TO THE LAST ONE JUST REQUIRES LEARNING WHICH COMBINATION OF SUBCOMPONENTS CORRESPONDS TO WHICH DIGITS
YOU1000000003_S0000068	OF COURSE THAT JUST KICKS THE PROBLEM DOWN THE ROAD BECAUSE HOW WOULD YOU RECOGNIZE THESE SUBCOMPONENTS OR EVEN LEARN WHAT THE RIGHT SUBCOMPONENTS SHOULD BE
YOU1000000003_S0000069	AND I STILL HAVEN'T EVEN TALKED ABOUT HOW ONE LAYER INFLUENCES THE NEXT BUT RUN WITH ME ON THIS ONE FOR A MOMENT RECOGNIZING A LOOP CAN ALSO BREAK DOWN INTO SUB PROBLEMS
YOU1000000003_S0000070	ONE REASONABLE WAY TO DO THIS WOULD BE TO FIRST RECOGNIZE THE VARIOUS LITTLE EDGES THAT MAKE IT UP
YOU1000000003_S0000071	SIMILARLY A LONG LINE LIKE THE KIND YOU MIGHT SEE IN THE DIGITS ONE OR FOUR OR SEVEN WELL THAT'S REALLY JUST A LONG EDGE OR MAYBE YOU THINK OF IT AS A CERTAIN PATTERN OF SEVERAL SMALLER EDGES
YOU1000000003_S0000072	SO MAYBE OUR HOPE IS THAT EACH NEURON IN THE SECOND LAYER OF THE NETWORK CORRESPONDS WITH THE VARIOUS RELEVANT LITTLE EDGES
YOU1000000003_S0000073	MAYBE WHEN AN IMAGE LIKE THIS ONE COMES IN IT LIGHTS UP ALL OF THE NEURONS ASSOCIATED WITH AROUND EIGHT TO TEN SPECIFIC LITTLE EDGES
YOU1000000003_S0000074	WHICH IN TURN LIGHTS UP THE NEURONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER LOOP AND A LONG VERTICAL LINE AND THOSE LIGHT UP THE NEURON ASSOCIATED WITH THE NINE
YOU1000000003_S0000075	WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS WHAT OUR FINAL NETWORK ACTUALLY DOES IS ANOTHER QUESTION ONE THAT I'LL COME BACK TO ONCE WE SEE HOW TO TRAIN THE NETWORK
YOU1000000003_S0000076	BUT THIS IS A HOPE THAT WE MIGHT HAVE A SORT OF GOAL WITH THE LAYERED STRUCTURE LIKE THIS
YOU1000000003_S0000077	MOREOVER YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW BEING ABLE TO DETECT EDGES AND PATTERNS LIKE THIS WOULD BE REALLY USEFUL FOR OTHER IMAGE RECOGNITION TASKS
YOU1000000003_S0000078	AND EVEN BEYOND IMAGE RECOGNITION THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF INTELLIGENT THINGS YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO THAT BREAK DOWN INTO LAYERS OF ABSTRACTION
YOU1000000003_S0000079	PARTING SPEECH FOR EXAMPLE INVOLVES TAKING RAW AUDIO AND PICKING OUT DISTINCT SOUNDS WHICH COMBINE TO MAKE CERTAIN SYLLABLES
YOU1000000003_S0000080	WHICH COMBINED TO FORM WORDS WHICH COMBINE TO MAKE UP PHRASES AND MORE ABSTRACT THOUGHTS ETC
YOU1000000003_S0000081	BUT GETTING BACK TO HOW ANY OF THIS ACTUALLY WORKS PICTURE YOURSELF RIGHT NOW DESIGNING HOW EXACTLY THE ACTIVATION IN ONE LAYER MIGHT DETERMINE THE ACTIVATION IN THE NEXT
YOU1000000003_S0000082	THE GOAL IS TO HAVE SOME MECHANISM THAT COULD CONCEIVABLY COMBINE PIXELS INTO EDGES OR EDGES INTO PATTERNS OR PATTERNS INTO DIGITS
YOU1000000003_S0000083	AND TO ZOOM IN ON ONE VERY SPECIFIC EXAMPLE LET'S SAY THE HOPE IS FOR ONE PARTICULAR NEURON IN THE SECOND LAYER
YOU1000000003_S0000084	TO PICK UP ON WHETHER OR NOT THE IMAGE HAS AN EDGE IN THIS REGION HERE
YOU1000000003_S0000085	THE QUESTION AT HAND IS WHAT PARAMETERS SHOULD THE NETWORK HAVE WHAT DIALS AND KNOBS SHOULD YOU BE ABLE TO TWEAK
YOU1000000003_S0000086	SO THAT IT'S EXPRESSIVE ENOUGH TO POTENTIALLY CAPTURE THIS PATTERN OR ANY OTHER PIXEL PATTERN OR THE PATTERN THAT SEVERAL EDGES CAN MAKE A LOOP AND OTHER SUCH THINGS
YOU1000000003_S0000087	WELL WHAT WE'LL DO IS ASSIGN A WEIGHT TO EACH ONE OF THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN OUR NEURONS AND THE NEURONS FROM THE FIRST LAYER
YOU1000000003_S0000088	THESE WEIGHTS ARE JUST NUMBERS THEN TAKE ALL OF THOSE ACTIVATIONS FROM THE FIRST LAYER AND COMPUTE THEIR WEIGHTED SUM ACCORDING TO THESE WEIGHTS
YOU1000000003_S0000090	I FIND IT HELPFUL TO THINK OF THESE WEIGHTS AS BEING ORGANIZED INTO A LITTLE GRID OF THEIR OWN AND I'M GOING TO USE GREEN PIXELS TO INDICATE POSITIVE WEIGHTS AND RED PIXELS TO INDICATE NEGATIVE WEIGHTS
YOU1000000003_S0000091	WHERE THE BRIGHTNESS OF THAT PIXEL IS SOME LOOSE DEPICTION OF THE WEIGHTS VALUE
YOU1000000003_S0000092	NOW IF WE MADE THE WEIGHTS ASSOCIATED WITH ALMOST ALL OF THE PIXEL ZERO EXCEPT FOR SOME POSITIVE WEIGHTS IN THIS REGION THAT WE CARE ABOUT
YOU1000000003_S0000093	THEN TAKING THE WEIGHTED SUM OF ALL THE PIXEL VALUES REALLY JUST AMOUNTS TO ADDING UP THE VALUES OF THE PIXEL JUST IN THE REGION THAT WE CARE ABOUT
YOU1000000003_S0000095	AND IF YOU REALLY WANTED TO PICK UP ON WHETHER THERE'S AN EDGE HERE WHAT YOU MIGHT DO IS HAVE SOME NEGATIVE WEIGHTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SURROUNDING PIXELS
YOU1000000003_S0000096	THEN THE SUM IS LARGEST WHEN THOSE MIDDLE PIXELS ARE BRIGHT BUT THE SURROUNDING PIXELS ARE DARKER
YOU1000000003_S0000098	YOU COMPUTE A WEIGHTED SUM LIKE THIS YOU MIGHT COME OUT WITH ANY NUMBER BUT FOR THIS NETWORK WHAT WE WANT IS FOR ACTIVATIONS TO BE SOME VALUE BETWEEN ZERO AND ONE
YOU1000000003_S0000099	SO A COMMON THING TO DO IS TO PUMP THIS WEIGHTED SUM INTO SOME FUNCTION THAT SQUISHES THE REAL NUMBER LINE INTO THE RANGE BETWEEN ZERO AND ONE
YOU1000000003_S0000100	AND A COMMON FUNCTION THAT DOES THIS IS CALLED THE SIGMOID FUNCTION ALSO KNOWN AS A LOGISTIC CURVE
YOU1000000003_S0000101	BASICALLY VERY NEGATIVE INPUTS END UP CLOSE TO ZERO VERY POSITIVE INPUTS END UP CLOSE TO ONE AND IT JUST STEADILY INCREASES AROUND THE INPUT ZERO
YOU1000000003_S0000103	THE ACTIVATION OF THE NEURON HERE IS BASICALLY A MEASURE OF HOW POSITIVE THE RELEVANT WEIGHTED SUM IS
YOU1000000003_S0000105	BUT MAYBE IT'S NOT THAT YOU WANT THE NEURON TO LIGHT UP WHEN THE WEIGHTED SUM IS BIGGER THAN ZERO MAYBE YOU ONLY WANT IT TO BE ACTIVE WHEN THE SUM IS BIGGER THAN SAY TEN
YOU1000000003_S0000106	THAT IS YOU WANT SOME BIAS FOR IT TO BE INACTIVE
YOU1000000003_S0000107	WHAT WE'LL DO THEN IS JUST ADD IN SOME OTHER NUMBER LIKE NEGATIVE TEN TO THIS WEIGHTED SUM BEFORE PLUGGING IT THROUGH THE SIGMOID QUALIFICATION FUNCTION
YOU1000000003_S0000108	THAT ADDITIONAL NUMBER IS CALLED THE BIAS
YOU1000000003_S0000109	SO THE WEIGHTS TELL YOU WHAT PIXEL PATTERN THIS NEURON IN THE SECOND LAYER IS PICKING UP ON AND THE BIAS TELLS YOU HOW HIGH THE WEIGHTED SUM NEEDS TO BE
YOU1000000003_S0000110	BEFORE THE NEURON STARTS GETTING MEANINGFULLY ACTIVE
YOU1000000003_S0000111	AND THAT IS JUST ONE NEURON EVERY OTHER NEURON IN THIS LAYER IS GOING TO BE CONNECTED TO ALL SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR PIXEL NEURONS FROM THE FIRST LAYER
YOU1000000003_S0000112	AND EACH ONE OF THOSE SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR CONNECTIONS HAS ITS OWN WEIGHT ASSOCIATED WITH IT
YOU1000000003_S0000113	ALSO EACH ONE HAS SOME BIAS SOME OTHER NUMBER THAT YOU ADD ONTO THE WEIGHTED SUM BEFORE SQUISHING IT WITH THE SIGMOID
YOU1000000003_S0000114	AND THAT'S A LOT TO THINK ABOUT
YOU1000000003_S0000115	WITH THIS HIDDEN LAYER OF SIXTEEN NEURONS THAT'S A TOTAL OF SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR TIMES SIXTEEN WEIGHTS ALONG WITH SIXTEEN BIASES
YOU1000000003_S0000116	AND ALL OF THAT IS JUST THE CONNECTIONS FROM THE FIRST LAYER TO THE SECOND THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE OTHER LAYERS ALSO HAVE A BUNCH OF WEIGHTS AND BIASES ASSOCIATED WITH THEM
YOU1000000003_S0000117	ALL SAID AND DONE THIS NETWORK HAS ALMOST EXACTLY THIRTEEN THOUSAND TOTAL WEIGHTS AND BIASES
YOU1000000003_S0000118	THIRTEEN THOUSAND KNOBS AND DIALS THAT CAN BE TWEAKED AND TURNED TO MAKE THIS NETWORK BEHAVE IN DIFFERENT WAYS
YOU1000000003_S0000120	SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT LEARNING WHAT THAT'S REFERRING TO IS GETTING THE COMPUTER TO FIND A VALID SETTING FOR ALL OF THESE MANY MANY NUMBERS SO THAT IT'LL ACTUALLY SOLVE THE PROBLEM AT HAND
YOU1000000003_S0000122	ONE THOUGHT EXPERIMENT THAT IS AT ONCE FUN AND KIND OF HORRIFYING IS TO IMAGINE SITTING DOWN AND SETTING ALL OF THESE WEIGHTS AND BIASES BY HAND
YOU1000000003_S0000123	PURPOSEFULLY TWEAKING THE NUMBERS SO THAT THE SECOND LAYER PICKS UP ON EDGES THE THIRD LAYER PICKS UP ON PATTERNS ETC
YOU1000000003_S0000124	I PERSONALLY FIND THIS SATISFYING RATHER THAN JUST TREATING THE NETWORK AS A TOTAL BLACK BOX
YOU1000000003_S0000125	BECAUSE WHEN THE NETWORK DOESN'T PERFORM THE WAY YOU ANTICIPATE
YOU1000000003_S0000126	IF YOU'VE BUILT UP A LITTLE BIT OF A RELATIONSHIP WITH WHAT THOSE WEIGHTS AND BIASES ACTUALLY MEAN YOU HAVE A STARTING PLACE FOR EXPERIMENTING WITH HOW TO CHANGE THE STRUCTURE TO IMPROVE
YOU1000000003_S0000127	OR WHEN THE NETWORK DOES WORK BUT NOT FOR THE REASONS YOU MIGHT EXPECT DIGGING INTO WHAT THE WEIGHTS AND BIASES ARE DOING IS A GOOD WAY TO CHALLENGE YOUR ASSUMPTIONS
YOU1000000003_S0000128	AND REALLY EXPOSE THE FULL SPACE OF POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS
YOU1000000003_S0000129	BY THE WAY THE ACTUAL FUNCTION HERE IS A LITTLE CUMBERSOME TO WRITE DOWN DON'T YOU THINK
YOU1000000003_S0000131	SO LET ME SHOW YOU A MORE NOTATIONAL COMPACT WAY THAT THESE CONNECTIONS ARE REPRESENTED THIS IS HOW YOU'D SEE IT IF YOU CHOOSE TO READ UP MORE ABOUT NEURAL NETWORKS
YOU1000000003_S0000132	ORGANIZE ALL OF THE ACTIVATIONS FROM ONE LAYER INTO A COLUMN AS A VECTOR
YOU1000000003_S0000134	THEN ORGANIZE ALL OF THE WEIGHTS AS A MATRIX WHERE EACH ROW OF THAT MATRIX CORRESPONDS TO THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN ONE LAYER AND A PARTICULAR NEURON IN THE NEXT LAYER
YOU1000000003_S0000135	WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT TAKING THE WEIGHTED SUM OF THE ACTIVATIONS IN THE FIRST LAYER ACCORDING TO THESE WEIGHTS
YOU1000000003_S0000136	CORRESPONDS TO ONE OF THE TERMS IN THE MATRIX VECTOR PRODUCT OF EVERYTHING WE HAVE ON THE LEFT HERE
YOU1000000003_S0000138	BY THE WAY SO MUCH OF MACHINE LEARNING JUST COMES DOWN TO HAVING A GOOD GRASP OF LINEAR ALGEBRA
YOU1000000003_S0000139	SO FOR ANY OF YOU WHO WANT A NICE VISUAL UNDERSTANDING FOR MATRICES AND WHAT MATRIX VECTOR MULTIPLICATION MEANS TAKE A LOOK AT THE SERIES I DID ON LINEAR ALGEBRA ESPECIALLY CHAPTER THREE
YOU1000000003_S0000140	BACK TO OUR EXPRESSION INSTEAD OF TALKING ABOUT ADDING THE BIAS TO EACH ONE OF THESE VALUES INDEPENDENTLY
YOU1000000003_S0000141	WE REPRESENT IT BY ORGANIZING ALL THOSE BIASES INTO A VECTOR AND ADDING THE ENTIRE VECTOR TO THE PREVIOUS MATRIX VECTOR PRODUCT
YOU1000000003_S0000142	THEN AS A FINAL STEP I'LL WRAP A SIGMOID AROUND THE OUTSIDE HERE
YOU1000000003_S0000143	AND WHAT THAT'S SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT IS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO APPLY THE SIGMOID FUNCTION TO EACH SPECIFIC COMPONENT OF THE RESULTING VECTOR INSIDE
YOU1000000003_S0000144	SO ONCE YOU WRITE DOWN THIS WEIGHT MATRIX AND THESE VECTORS AS THEIR OWN SYMBOLS YOU CAN COMMUNICATE THE FULL TRANSITION OF ACTIVATION FROM ONE LAYER TO THE NEXT
YOU1000000003_S0000145	IN AN EXTREMELY TIGHT AND NEAT LITTLE EXPRESSION
YOU1000000003_S0000146	AND THIS MAKES THE RELEVANT CODE BOTH A LOT SIMPLER AND A LOT FASTER SINCE MANY LIBRARIES OPTIMIZE THE HECK OUT OF MATRIX MULTIPLICATION
YOU1000000003_S0000148	REMEMBER HOW EARLIER I SAID THESE NEURONS ARE SIMPLY THINGS THAT HOLD NUMBERS WELL OF COURSE THE SPECIFIC NUMBERS THAT THEY HOLD DEPENDS ON THE IMAGE YOU FEED IN
YOU1000000003_S0000150	SO IT'S ACTUALLY MORE ACCURATE TO THINK OF EACH NEURON AS A FUNCTION ONE THAT TAKES IN THE OUTPUTS OF ALL THE NEURONS IN THE PREVIOUS LAYER AND SPITS OUT A NUMBER BETWEEN ZERO AND ONE
YOU1000000003_S0000151	REALLY THE ENTIRE NETWORK IS JUST A FUNCTION ONE THAT TAKES IN SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR NUMBERS AS AN INPUT AND SPITS OUT TEN NUMBERS AS AN OUTPUT
YOU1000000003_S0000152	IT'S AN ABSURDLY COMPLICATED FUNCTION ONE THAT INVOLVES THIRTEEN THOUSAND PARAMETERS IN THE FORMS OF THESE WEIGHTS AND BIASES THAT PICK UP ON CERTAIN PATTERNS
YOU1000000003_S0000153	AND WHICH INVOLVES ITERATING MANY MATRIX VECTOR PRODUCTS AND THE SIGMOID QUANTIFICATION FUNCTION
YOU1000000003_S0000154	BUT IT'S JUST A FUNCTION NONETHELESS AND IN A WAY IT'S KIND OF REASSURING THAT IT LOOKS COMPLICATED
YOU1000000003_S0000155	I MEAN IF IT WERE ANY SIMPLER WHAT HOPE WOULD WE HAVE THAT IT COULD TAKE ON THE CHALLENGE OF RECOGNIZING DIGITS AND HOW DOES IT TAKE ON THAT CHALLENGE
YOU1000000003_S0000156	HOW DOES THIS NETWORK LEARN THE APPROPRIATE WEIGHTS AND BIASES JUST BY LOOKING AT DATA THAT'S WHAT I'LL SHOW IN THE NEXT VIDEO
YOU1000000003_S0000157	AND I'LL ALSO DIG A LITTLE MORE INTO WHAT THIS PARTICULAR NETWORK WE'RE SEEING IS REALLY DOING
YOU1000000003_S0000159	NOW IS THE POINT I SUPPOSE I SHOULD SAY SUBSCRIBE TO STAY NOTIFIED ABOUT WHEN THAT VIDEO OR ANY NEW VIDEOS COME OUT
YOU1000000003_S0000160	BUT REALISTICALLY MOST OF YOU DON'T ACTUALLY RECEIVE NOTIFICATIONS FROM YOUTUBE DO YOU
YOU1000000003_S0000161	MAYBE MORE HONESTLY I SHOULD SAY SUBSCRIBE SO THAT THE NEURAL NETWORKS THAT UNDERLIE YOUTUBE'S RECOMMENDATION ALGORITHM
YOU1000000003_S0000162	ARE PRIMED TO BELIEVE THAT YOU WANT TO SEE CONTENT FROM THIS CHANNEL GET RECOMMENDED TO YOU ANYWAY STAY POSTED FOR MORE
YOU1000000003_S0000163	THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO EVERYONE SUPPORTING THESE VIDEOS ON PATREON
YOU1000000003_S0000164	I'VE BEEN A LITTLE SLOW TO PROGRESS IN THE PROBABILITY SERIES THIS SUMMER BUT I'M JUMPING BACK INTO IT AFTER THIS PROJECT SO PATRONS YOU CAN LOOK OUT FOR UPDATES THERE
YOU1000000003_S0000166	TO CLOSE THINGS OFF HERE I HAVE WITH ME LISA LEE WHO DID HER PH D WORK ON THE THEORETICAL SIDE OF DEEP LEARNING
YOU1000000003_S0000167	AND WHO CURRENTLY WORKS AT A VENTURE CAPITAL FIRM CALLED AMPLIFY PARTNERS WHO KINDLY PROVIDED SOME OF THE FUNDING FOR THIS VIDEO
YOU1000000003_S0000168	SO LISA ONE THING I THINK WE SHOULD QUICKLY BRING UP IS THIS SIGMOID FUNCTION
YOU1000000003_S0000169	AS I UNDERSTAND IT EARLY NETWORKS USE THIS TO SQUISH THE RELEVANT WEIGHTED SUM INTO THAT INTERVAL BETWEEN ZERO AND ONE
YOU1000000003_S0000170	YOU KNOW KIND OF MOTIVATED BY THIS BIOLOGICAL ANALOGY OF NEURONS EITHER BEING INACTIVE OR ACT
YOU1000000003_S0000171	EXACTLY
YOU1000000003_S0000172	BUT RELATIVELY FEW MODERN NETWORKS ACTUALLY USED SIGMOID ANYMORE THAT'S KIND OF OLD SCHOOL
YOU1000000003_S0000173	YEAH OR RATHER WELL USE SEEMS TO BE MUCH EASIER TO TRAIN
YOU1000000003_S0000174	AND RELORAL STANDS FOR RECTIFIED LINEAR UNIT
YOU1000000003_S0000175	YES IT'S THIS KIND OF FUNCTION WHERE YOU'RE JUST TAKING A MAX OF ZERO
YOU1000000003_S0000176	AND WHERE IS GIVEN BY WHAT YOU WERE EXPLAINING IN THE VIDEO
YOU1000000003_S0000177	AND WHAT THIS WAS SORT OF MOTIVATED FROM I THINK WAS PARTIALLY BIOLOGICAL ANALOGY WITH HOW NEURONS WOULD EITHER BE ACTIVATED
YOU1000000003_S0000178	OR NOT AND SO IF IT PASSES A CERTAIN THRESHOLD IT WOULD BE THE IDENTITY FUNCTION BUT IF IT DID NOT THEN IT WOULD JUST NOT BE ACTIVATED SO ZERO SO IT'S KIND OF A SIMPLIFICATION
YOU1000000003_S0000179	USING SIGMOIDS DIDN'T HELP TRAINING OR IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO TRAIN AT SOME POINT AND PEOPLE JUST TRIED REAL YOU
YOU1000000003_S0000180	AND IT HAPPENED TO WORK VERY WELL FOR THESE INCREDIBLY DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS

YOU1000000015_S0000054	I'LL SEE YOU IN THE NEXT ONE
YOU1000000019_S0000000	HEY GUYS WHAT'S UP IT'S THE CUBE AND IN THIS VIDEO WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT THE VOLK THREE THE FIRST CUBE SINCE TWENTY TEN TO BE NAMED AFTER SPEED CUBE
YOU1000000019_S0000001	VISION FOR THE VOLK THREE WAS BROUGHT ABOUT BY MATT WALK WHO'S THE FORMER THREE BY THREE SINGLE WORLD RECORD HOLDER AND THE THIRD PLACE WINNER OF US NATIONALS THIS YEAR
YOU1000000019_S0000002	THE CUBE WAS DESIGNED BY MOVING AND WAS APPROVED BY MATT WALK OF COURSE THE CUBE IS HIS MAIN BUT LET'S SEE HOW THE CUBE ACTUALLY PERFORMS AND WHETHER IT'S RIGHT FOR YOU
YOU1000000019_S0000004	THERE IS ON THE PRICER SIDE OF THINGS IT'S ABOUT TWENTY DOLLARS AND IF YOU OPT FOR THE CUBICLE PREMIUM VERSION LIKE I DID IT'S GONNA BE TWENTY SEVEN DOLLARS
YOU1000000019_S0000005	CUBE IN THIS REVIEW WILL BE THE PREMIUM VOLK THREE AND I HAVEN'T CHANGED THE LOB AT ALL I'VE JUST TIGHTENED THE TENSIONS A LITTLE BIT IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW THE PREMIUM VOLK THREE IS PREPARED THE LINK WILL BE IN THE DESCRIPTION
YOU1000000019_S0000006	YOU WANT TO CHECK THAT OUT ANYWAYS MOVING ON THE WALK THREE MEASURES FIFTY FIVE POINT FIVE MILLIMETERS ACROSS KINDA FEEL LIKE THAT WAS PLANNED A LITTLE BIT
YOU1000000019_S0000007	BUT I GUESS WE'LL NEVER KNOW FOR SURE THE STOCK STICKERS ARE LABELED AS THE THE HALFBRIGHT SHADES BUT THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH IDENTICAL TO SMITH HALFBRIGHT
YOU1000000019_S0000008	WHICH IF YOU GUYS DIDN'T KNOW WERE THE SHADES THAT EVERYONE USED TO USE BEFORE THE CUBICLE STICKERS BECAME POPULAR SO LET'S TALK ABOUT TURNING
YOU1000000019_S0000009	OUT OF THE BOX THE WALK THREE REMINDED ME OF A US A BIT WHEN I OPENED UP THE CUBES TO COMPARE THE MECHANISMS I WAS ACTUALLY VERY SURPRISED TO SEE THAT THEY WERE ALMOST IDENTICAL SEEMINGLY
YOU1000000019_S0000010	EVEN MY POSTED SOME PHOTOS OF THE USA AND THE WALK THREE NEXT TO EACH OTHER AND THE MECHANISMS LOOKED PRETTY MUCH THE SAME
YOU1000000019_S0000011	BUT SHE THEN WENT ON TO POST SOME MORE PHOTOS AND EXPLAIN SOME MORE OF THE SUBTLE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO CUBES
YOU1000000019_S0000012	AND OF COURSE FEELING A BROKEN IN USE AND BROKEN IN ALL THREE THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH NOTHING ALIKE THE VALUE THREE IS PRETTY MUCH ENTIRELY SMOOTH THERE ARE NO BUMPS OR ANYTHING ALONG THE TURN
YOU1000000019_S0000013	IT'S JUST COMPLETELY SMOOTH IT'S ALSO VERY LIGHT AND VERY FAST VERY LITTLE EFFORT IS REQUIRED TO START A TURN SO THE CUBE IS BEST SUITED FOR A LIGHT ACCURATE TURNSTYLE
YOU1000000019_S0000014	WHEN TURNING FAST THE CUBE DOES BECOME A BIT CLICKY AND HAS A VERY RIGID FEEL IN GENERAL THE CUBE IS EASY TO CONTROL ON TIGHT TENSIONS BUT SOMETIMES I DO LOSE CONTROL AND OVERSHOOT
YOU1000000019_S0000015	CAUSING A LOCKUP ALTHOUGH THIS MOSTLY HAPPENS WHEN I'M SPAMMING TPS IN THE LAST LAYER SO I'VE HAD TO LEARN TO CONTROL MY SPEED TO HELP WITH OVERSHOOTING
YOU1000000019_S0000016	AND IN GENERAL I'VE JUST HAD TO ADJUST MY TURNING STYLE QUITE A BIT TO DO WELL WITH THIS CUBE SINCE I'VE BEEN USING THE LONG V TWO AS MY MAIN I WOULD SAY I'VE ADAPTED MORE OF A HARSHER TURNSTYLE
YOU1000000019_S0000017	AS THE TWO IS VERY FORGIVING BUT IT'S ALSO NOT SUPER FAST SO YOU CAN TURN VERY ROUGH AND YOU WON'T LOCK UP BASICALLY
YOU1000000019_S0000018	BUT IF YOU USE THAT TURNSTYLE WITH WALK IT JUST LOCKS UP COMPLETELY SO I'VE HAD TO WORK ON ADJUSTING MY TURNSTYLE TO BE A BIT SLOWER LITTLE BIT MORE PRECISE
YOU1000000019_S0000019	BUT WITH A BIT OF PRACTICE I'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET MY TIMES BACK DOWN TO WHAT THEY USUALLY ARE AND I'VE PRETTY MUCH STOPPED GETTING LOCKUPS THE CORNER CUTTING ON THE VOLK IS UP TO PAR WITH ANY MODERN SPEED CUBE
YOU1000000019_S0000020	ALTHOUGH I DID NOTICE AFTER TIGHTENING THE TENSIONS IT WAS MUCH HARDER TO CUT PAST FORTY FIVE SAME WITH THE REVERSE BUT SMALLER CUTS WERE JUST FINE
YOU1000000019_S0000021	HE HOWEVER JUST FEELS A BIT MORE RIGID AND STURDY THAN OTHER THREE BY THREE WHICH I REALLY LIKE IT'S A VERY STABLE PUZZLE IT'S JUST NOT AS FORGIVING AS SOME OTHER THREE BY THREE
YOU1000000019_S0000022	POPPING AND CORNER TWISTING OF COURSE NEVER HAPPENED ON THIS CUBE THOSE ARE TWO THINGS THAT REALLY DON'T EVEN NEED TO BE TALKED ABOUT IN REVIEWS ANYMORE BECAUSE PRETTY MUCH ALL CUBES HAVE THOSE TRAITS
YOU1000000019_S0000023	OVERALL THE PERFORMANCE OF THE VOLK THREE IS REALLY REALLY GOOD BUT THERE ARE JUST A FEW THINGS THAT BUG ME ABOUT IT THAT I'M JUST NOT A HUGE FAN OF FIRST OF ALL THE SIZE
YOU1000000019_S0000024	FIFTY FIVE POINT FIVE MILLIMETERS IS JUST A LITTLE TOO SMALL FOR ME I DO PREFER FIFTY SEVEN MILLIMETER CUBES MAINLY BECAUSE MY HANDS ARE REALLY BIG
YOU1000000019_S0000025	AND I ACTUALLY FOUND MY FINGERS GETTING CAUGHT ON THE LAYERS SOMETIMES ESPECIALLY DOING TURNS I JUST NOTICED THAT TO HAPPEN IT'S NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL THOUGH
YOU1000000019_S0000026	BUT IT'S JUST SOMETHING I NOTICED SECOND IS THE COMPLETELY SMOOTH TURNING I PREFER CUBES THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE BUMPY AND A LITTLE SLOWER
YOU1000000019_S0000027	THE CUBE JUST GLIDES SO EFFORTLESSLY IT'S KIND OF HARD TO CONTROL SOMETIMES THIS IS ANOTHER ONE THAT I'VE GOTTEN USED TO OVER TIME AND I'M STARTING TO ACTUALLY ENJOY NOW BUT I STILL THOUGHT I'D BRING IT
YOU1000000019_S0000028	FINALLY THE SQUARED OFF CORNERS NOW I SAY THIS IN EVERY VIEW I DON'T REALLY LIKE SQUARED OFF CORNERS FOR ME THEY JUST COST TOO MUCH CATCHING AND I DON'T REALLY CORNER TWIST EITHER WAY
YOU1000000019_S0000029	SO IT'S NOT REALLY AN ADVANTAGE FOR ME BUT THIS CUBE IN PARTICULAR I FELT HAS A BIGGER CATCHING ISSUE
YOU1000000019_S0000030	I'M NOT SURE WHY BUT I NOTICE THE CORNER CATCHING ON THE CENTER MORE OFTEN THAN WITH OTHER SQUARED OFF CORNER PUZZLES I JUST THINK THAT IF THE CORNERS WERE ROUNDED OFF ALL OF THE CATCHING PROBLEMS WOULD PRETTY MUCH DISAPPEAR
YOU1000000019_S0000031	ONCE AGAIN I'VE PRETTY MUCH GOTTEN USED TO IT BUT I WOULD STILL PREFER IT IF THEY WEREN'T THERE OVERALL THE THREE IS AN EXTREMELY SOLID CUBE
YOU1000000019_S0000032	THE PERFORMANCE IS REALLY TOP OF THE LINE AND MY PROBLEMS WITH IT ARE REALLY JUST MORE MINOR ANNOYANCES THE VA HAS HUGE POTENTIAL IN MY OPINION TO BE ONE OF THE BEST
YOU1000000019_S0000033	IF NOT THE BEST SPEED CUBES YOU CAN BUY AND IT HONESTLY SURPRISES ME THAT I'M SAYING THAT THE CUBE HAS GOTTEN ME SOME NEW PERSONAL BESTS AND IT'S GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO BEATING MY ALONG
YOU1000000019_S0000034	I CAN'T SAY FOR SURE THAT I'LL MAKE IT MY MAN AS I STILL DO HAVE SOME MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT IT BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD ABSOLUTELY GIVE THIS A SHOT IF YOU'VE BEEN ON THE FENCE ABOUT
YOU1000000019_S0000035	IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT DEFINITELY GET THE PREMIUM VERSION IT'S SET UP PERFECTLY AND I HAVEN'T HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT BUT ANYWAY THAT'S ALL I'VE GOT TO SAY ABOUT THE COMPANY WALK THREE

YOU1000000021_S0000024	SANG EXPLAINS THIS TECHNOLOGY WAS STOLEN FROM CHINA WHICH ALLOWED GENESIS TO IMPLANT HIS ABILITIES AND STRENGTH ON OTHER SOLDIER MEMBERS OR MONSTERS
YOU1000000021_S0000025	ORIGINALLY IT WAS TO CLONE THEIR BEST SOLDIERS TO MAKE UP FOR THE LOW NUMBERS THEY CURRENTLY HAVE BUT ZACH IS MORE KEEN TO NOTE THAT THIS INFERS THAT SOLDIERS AND MONSTERS ARE FUNDAMENTALLY AND BIOLOGICALLY THE SAME
YOU1000000021_S0000026	MOVING ON SONG INFORMS ZACH THAT ANGEL AND GENESIS WERE CHILDHOOD BEST FRIENDS THAT GREW UP TOGETHER WHICH IS WHY SEPARATE THINKS THEY ARE IN CAHOOTS WITH THEIR DESERTION

YOU1000000033_S0000021	AND IT WAS SHAKEN BECAUSE THERE WERE JUST SO MANY THEORIES BEING THROWN AT US OR THINGS THAT WE HAD BELIEVED OR SEEMED TO BE IN CONCRETE WERE SUDDENLY UP FOR QUESTION AND I REALIZED THAT I WASN'T ROOTED DEEPLY ENOUGH
YOU1000000033_S0000022	YET I HAD HAD A GOOD EDUCATION I HAD HAD RELIGIOUS FORMATION BUT SOMETHING HAD BEEN TRANSMITTED FROM HERE TO HERE
YOU1000000033_S0000023	YEAH LIKE SO MANY PEOPLE GET CAUGHT UP IN THE CONFUSION OF OUR CULTURE MORAL CONFUSION INTELLECTUAL CONFUSION AND THEN A FRIEND INVITED ME TO MAKE A RETREAT WHEN I WAS A SENIOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME AND
YOU1000000033_S0000024	I WAS VERY SKEPTICAL ABOUT IT I FELT LIKE I WAS A PHILOSOPHY MAJOR AND I FELT LIKE I KIND OF KNOW ABOUT THESE THINGS AND AND AND THEN I JUST HEARD THIS MOST AMAZING STORY ABOUT THE CATHOLIC FAITH AND HOW BEAUTIFUL IT WAS BUT THAT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ENOUGH
YOU1000000033_S0000025	I REALLY EXPERIENCED THE PERSONAL PRESENCE OF CHRIST ON THAT RETREAT AND I FELT LIKE HE WAS ADDRESSING ME I DIDN'T HEAR ANY WORDS BUT I JUST KNEW HE WAS THERE AND I JUST KNEW THAT I HAD TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT HIM YOU KNOW WAS HE WHO HE SAID HE WAS OR NOT
YOU1000000033_S0000026	WHEN I WAS TWENTY YEARS OLD NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT MY SISTER CONVINCED ME TO GO TO A CONFERENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME AND I ALWAYS WANTED TO SEE NOTRE DAME TOUCHDOWN JESUS I THOUGHT I'LL GO
YOU1000000033_S0000027	THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND CATHOLICS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED PRIESTS AND BISHOPS IT WAS A CATHOLIC CHARISMATIC RENEWAL EVENT
YOU1000000033_S0000028	AND WHEN I GOT THERE I REALIZED I WAS IN A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE THAN WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE EVERY OTHER PERSON IN THE STADIUM EVERYBODY SEEMED TO JUST BE SO ALIVE AND ANIMATED IN THEIR FAITH
YOU1000000033_S0000029	I WAS A PRETTY NOMINAL CATHOLIC AT THAT POINT I'D SEEN GOD DO SOME AMAZING THINGS IN MY FAMILY BUT ESSENTIALLY THAT WEEKEND I BEGAN TO SEARCH AND HUNGER
YOU1000000033_S0000030	IF HE REALLY WAS THE SON OF GOD IF HE REALLY WAS ALIVE IF HE REALLY WAS PRESENT I KNEW THAT MY SEARCH HAD JUST COME TO AN END UNEXPECTEDLY SOON I THOUGHT I'D BE SEARCHING FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS BUT THERE HE WAS
YOU1000000033_S0000031	AND BY THE GRACE AND MERCY OF GOD I WAS ABLE TO SWALLOW MY PRIDE AND REPENT AND GO TO CONFESSION AND REALLY SURRENDER MY LIFE TO THE LORD AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU I'M JUST PROFOUNDLY GRATEFUL FOR GOD'S MERCY TO ME AND HELPING ME FIND HIM WHEN I DID
YOU1000000033_S0000032	I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'D BE TODAY WITHOUT HIM
YOU1000000033_S0000033	AND SO I WAS INSPIRED TO CALL A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE WHO WAS CARMELITE SISTER AND I TALKED TO HER AND AFTER WE TALKED FOR FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MINUTES SHE SAID TO ME
YOU1000000033_S0000035	WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR
YOU1000000033_S0000037	AND I SAID I DON'T KNOW
YOU1000000033_S0000039	BUT I WANT TO GIVE MY LIFE TO GOD IN A WAY I NEVER HAVE BEFORE AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS I'VE GIVEN HIM MY WHOLE LIFE HE HAS MY MY VOWS I'M VOWED TO HIM WHAT WHAT MORE CAN I GIVE HIM
YOU1000000033_S0000040	AND HER RESPONSE WAS VERY WISE WE WERE THE SAME AGE BUT HER RESPONSE WAS VERY WISE SHE SAID TO ME THEN JUST TELL HIM THAT
YOU1000000033_S0000042	SO I WENT HOME AND WALKED INTO THE CHAPEL AND SAID LORD I WANT TO GIVE MY LIFE TO YOU IN A WAY I NEVER HAVE BEFORE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS BUT YOU HAVE IT WHATEVER THAT IS
YOU1000000033_S0000044	I WALKED OUT OF THE CHAPEL AND
YOU1000000033_S0000046	NOTHING NO NO BELLS AND WHISTLES AS THEY SAY TODAY YOU KNOW NOTHING LIKE THAT I JUST WALKED OUT OF THE CHAPEL AND STARTED UP THE STAIRS WAS GOING TO CORRECT PAPERS
YOU1000000033_S0000047	AND AS I WAS WALKING UP THE STAIRS AS I OFTEN SAY IF I COULD GO INTO THAT CONVENT TODAY I COULD TELL YOU THE EXACT STEP WHERE I WAS
YOU1000000033_S0000048	WHEN IT WAS LIKE SOMEBODY TOOK A PICTURE OF WATER
YOU1000000033_S0000050	AND POURED IT OVER MY HEAD
YOU1000000033_S0000052	
YOU1000000033_S0000054	THAT'S THE ONLY THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY I COULD DESCRIBE THE EXPERIENCE
YOU1000000033_S0000056	BUT I WAS NOT AFRAID
YOU1000000033_S0000058	AND I WAS CYNICAL I WAS STILL PRETTY CYNICAL AND I TOOK A FEW MORE STEPS UP AND I SAID GOD IS THIS YOU
YOU1000000033_S0000060	WHAT IS THIS
YOU1000000033_S0000062	AND HE SAID IT IS MY HOLY SPIRIT
YOU1000000033_S0000064	HOW DID I HEAR NO AUDIBLE VOICE JUST A THOUGHT GOES THROUGH YOUR HEAD THAT YOU KNOW IS NOT YOUR OWN
YOU1000000033_S0000066	HE SAID THIS IS MY HOLY SPIRIT AND THE JOY THAT CAME INTO MY LIFE AND THAT MOMENT HAS NEVER GONE
YOU1000000033_S0000068	WELL YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN I FIRST TURNED MY LIFE OVER TO THE LORD WHEN I WAS A SENIOR AT NOTRE DAME I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PLANS TO GO INTO MINISTER
YOU1000000033_S0000069	JUST KNEW I HAD MET GOD AND THAT WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN MY LIFE SO I WENT OFF TO GRAD SCHOOL TO PRINCETON AND THEN I TOOK A LEAVE FROM GRAD SCHOOL TO BEGIN WORKING FOR THE COURSE MOVEMENT
YOU1000000033_S0000070	I GOT INVOLVED IN THE CHARISMATIC RENEWAL MOVEMENT AND THEN CARDINAL SINS ASKED ME TO MOVE TO BELGIUM SO IT ISN'T LIKE I HAD A PLAN
YOU1000000033_S0000071	I'M TRYING NOT TO PUT ANY LIMITS ON THE LORD I'M TRYING NOT TO HAVE ANY PRESUPPOSITIONS I'M TRYING TO EACH DAY GET UP AND DO WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE MOST PLEASING THING TO HIM
YOU1000000033_S0000072	SO THEN THE LAST THE CLOSING OF THE EVENT WAS A BIG LITURGY IN THE FOOTBALL STADIUM AND I WAS BEGGING THE LORD IN MY HEART
YOU1000000033_S0000073	PLEASE HELP ME GIVE ME THE FAITH GIVE ME THE LOVE GIVE ME SOMETHING BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE THE STRENGTH TO RESIST SIN ESSENTIALLY AND TO REALLY LIVE FOR YOU WHOLEHEARTEDLY
YOU1000000033_S0000074	AND I WENT TO COMMUNION CAME BACK FROM COMMUNION I WAS STANDING IN MY PLACE AND THIS GUY COMES UP TO ME AND HE'S GOT HIS NAME TAG ON HE'S FROM INDIANAPOLIS GUY MAYBE IN HIS MID FORTY S AT THE TIME I WAS TWENTY
YOU1000000033_S0000075	AND HE SAID TO ME HE SAID SON HE LOOKED AT MY NAME SAID PETER DO YOU MIND IF I SHARE SOMETHING WITH YOU AND I SAID SURE HE SAID I'M BACK HERE ABOUT SIX ROWS AND GOING TO COMMUNION AND I SAW YOU AND MY EYES FELL ON YOU
YOU1000000033_S0000076	AND I FELT THE HOLY SPIRIT TOUCH MY HEART AND SAY YOU GO TELL THAT YOUNG MAN THAT THE FAITH AND LOVE THAT HE'S SEEKING SHALL BE GRANTED TO HIM BECAUSE CHRIST LOVES HIM AND HAS DIED FOR HIM
YOU1000000033_S0000077	AND AS SOON AS HE SAID THAT IT WAS LIKE A BOMB WENT
YOU1000000033_S0000079	GRACE OF GOD TOUCHED ME IN A NEW WAY AND I PUT MY ARMS AROUND THE GUY AND WE STOOD THERE AND JUST SQUEEZED HIM AND I CRIED LIKE A BABY ON HIS SHOULDER AND I FELT
YOU1000000033_S0000080	I FELT IN MY SPIRIT AND I THINK THAT'S THE DAY I EXPERIENCED THE CALLING FOR WHAT I'M DOING RIGHT NOW AND AS THIS GUY'S HOLDING ME I'M JUST EXPERIENCING A TREMENDOUS SENSE OF THE LOVE OF GOD POURING INTO ME
YOU1000000033_S0000081	AND THE LORDSHIP AND THE MAJESTY OF JESUS CHRIST THAT HE'S THE LORD ALL POWER AND AUTHORITY BELONGS TO HIM AND HE SAID MY SON I'M CALLING YOU TRUST ME
YOU1000000033_S0000082	AND THEN HE LOOKED AROUND IT SEEMED LIKE PEOPLE WERE GETTING TOUCHED EVERYWHERE LIKE THAT AND I FELT IN MY HEART LIKE THE HOLY SPIRIT WAS SAYING WELCOME THE REIGN OF GOD IS AT HAND YOU'RE PART OF THE KINGDOM THE KINGDOM IS ALIVE BECAUSE THE KING IS ALIVE AND I WENT HOME MY WHOLE LIFE CHANGED AFTER THAT
YOU1000000033_S0000084	I BEGAN WITH RENEWAL MINISTRIES BACK IN ACTUALLY I KNEW RALPH FOR QUITE A NUMBER OF YEARS AND WE SPOKE AT SOME CONFERENCES TOGETHER AND CERTAINLY HAD SOMEWHAT OF A COMMON MIND
YOU1000000033_S0000085	AND THEN PETER CAME INTO THE PICTURE AS WELL AND THE THREE OF US JUST AT DIFFERENT TIMES COLLABORATING AT A CONFERENCE SOMEWHERE WE BEGAN TO SEE THAT WE ALL HAD A KIND OF SIMILAR MESSAGE
YOU1000000033_S0000086	I SAW RALPH MARTIN ON THAT CONFERENCE FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER HE WAS A SPEAKER NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT
YOU1000000033_S0000087	THERE WAS A LOT OF SPEAKERS BUT WHEN HE SPOKE THAT SATURDAY AFTERNOON HE SPOKE LIKE LIKE THE PROPHET ELIJAH FOR SOME REASON IT WENT RIGHT THROUGH ME LIKE A SWORD AND IT BROUGHT TREMENDOUS CONVICTION TO ME
YOU1000000033_S0000088	THAT'S PARTLY WHAT I WAS PRAYING FOR WAS THAT KIND OF CONVICTION AND THAT CARRIED THROUGH FOR ME AS I LEFT THAT PLACE I BOUGHT EVERY TAPE EVERY EVERY BOOK I COULD FIND OF HIS AND I READ IT AND I GOT OTHER GUYS TO DO IT WITH ME
YOU1000000033_S0000089	AND WE WOULD LITERALLY WE'D SPEND FRIDAY NIGHTS SOME FRIDAY NIGHTS DURING IN COLLEGE BELIEVE IT OR NOT AND WE WOULD LISTEN TO THESE TALKS AND IT WOULD REALLY BURN IN US AND WE'D GET ON OUR KNEES WE'D GET ON OUR FACE IN THE CARPET AND WE'D SAY LORD JESUS WHAT YOU PUT IN HIM PUT IN US
YOU1000000033_S0000090	AND HE DID
YOU1000000033_S0000091	WE ALL HAD A REALLY STRONG ENCOUNTER WITH THE LORD IN DIFFERENT WAYS THROUGH THE CATHOLIC CHARISMATIC RENEWAL AND WE ALL ENDED UP HERE IN ANN ARBOR MICHIGAN AS PART OF A COVENANT COMMUNITY AND WE KNEW EACH OTHER THERE
YOU1000000033_S0000092	BUT THEN AT A CERTAIN POINT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE THINGS WERE KIND OF HAPPENING AND CHANGING AROUND US
YOU1000000033_S0000093	WE FOUND OURSELVES DRAWN TOGETHER AND WE FELT LIKE THE LORD IS CALLING US TO MEET EVERY WEEK FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF PRAYER AND JUST REALLY ASKING THE LORD WHAT HE WANTED FOR US AND FROM THAT CAME MUCH CLOSER COLLABORATION
YOU1000000033_S0000094	HOW IT ALL BEGAN IN RALPH MENTION THIS BUT KIND OF HOW IT ALL BEGAN WAS HE AND I WENT TO HEAR A TALK IN DETROIT AT A LARGE CONFERENCE WE CAN'T WANT TO HEAR ONE SPEAKER AT THIS LARGER CONFERENCE
YOU1000000033_S0000096	AND WE HEARD THE SPEAKER HAS GOOD WE'RE GETTING READY TO LEAVE THE GUY WHO WAS SEEING THE EVENT WAS MAKING ANNOUNCEMENTS JUST BEFORE LUNCH AND HE MADE ALL THIS ANNOUNCEMENTS AND HE SAID BUT
YOU1000000033_S0000097	BEFORE WE GO I JUST WANTED TO MENTION OUR LEADERSHIP TEAM UP HERE AND OUR PROPHESY TEAM FEEL CALLED TO PRAY FOR TWO MEN WHO ARE HERE TODAY THERE'S ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE IN THE CROWD AND THEY POINTED US OUT AND WE WEREN'T EVEN MEMBERS OF THE CONFERENCE WE DIDN'T THINK THEY WERE TALKING TO US
YOU1000000033_S0000098	AND EVENTUALLY THEY SAID IT'S YOUTUBE WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO HAVE OUR TEAM PRAY WITH YOU AND WE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER SAID ALL RIGHT WHY NOT AND SO EVERYBODY GOT EXCUSED FOR LUNCH WE WENT UP THERE WITH THE TEAM AND AND A MATURE GROUP OF PEOPLE
YOU1000000033_S0000099	AND THEY STARTED PRAYING FIRST WITH RALPH AND I'M JUST KIND OF WATCHING AND AND IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES WHERE I SAW THE GIFT OF PROPHECY KIND OF WORD OF KNOWLEDGE WORKING IN A IN A VERY POWERFUL WAY
YOU1000000033_S0000100	AND THEY STARTED SAYING THINGS ABOUT RALPH AND ABOUT HIS LIFE WHICH THEY COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN THAT WERE INDICATIONS OF HOW GOD HAD WORKED IN HIM AND AND WHAT THE LORD WANTED TO DO WITH HIM
YOU1000000033_S0000101	SO I'M THINKING WOW THIS IS PROBABLY GET A LITTLE TOO CLOSE I DON'T THINK I WANT TO LISTEN THINK I WANT TO GO BEFORE IT'S MY TURN KIND OF THING AND SO ANYWAY THEY PRAYED OVER ME AND THEY SAID ONE PERSON SAID THE LORD'S GOING TO START SEWING YOU INTO LANDS ALL AROUND THE WORLD
YOU1000000033_S0000103	AND HE'S GOING TO BRING TO YOU MEN AND WOMEN WHO HE IS ALREADY HE'S ALREADY CALLED AND HE'S ALREADY EMPOWERED TO BE ABLE TO STAND ALONGSIDE YOU AND ONE PERSON SAID YEAH I SEE THESE THESE IMAGES OF BATTLESHIPS ALL LINED UP
YOU1000000033_S0000104	AND THEY'RE ALL EQUIPPED AND THEY'RE ALL READY TO GO AND THE LORD WANTS YOU TO LAUNCH THEM AND THOSE BATTLESHIPS ARE PEOPLE AND BISHOPS AND PRIESTS AND LAY PEOPLE THAT GOD HAS CALLED TO GO TO THE WORLD TO ENGAGE THE NEW EVANGELIZATION AND HE WANTS YOU GUYS TO HELP LAUNCH THEM
YOU1000000033_S0000105	AND SO AFTER IT WAS ALL DONE WE WERE DRIVING HOME AND SAYING WOW WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT YOU KNOW AND RALPH SAID JUST SAID YOU KNOW SCRIPTURE IS VERY CLEAR IT SAYS TO NEVER DESPISE PROPHECY BUT TEST EVERYTHING AND CLING TO WHAT IS GOOD
YOU1000000033_S0000106	SO WE BEGAN TO PRAY ONCE A WEEK TOGETHER TO SAY LORD IF THIS IS YOU WE'RE READY TO RECEIVE IT IF IT'S NOT YOU WE WEREN'T WORKING TOGETHER AT THAT TIME WE WERE JUST WE WERE IN THE SAME COMMUNITY THE SAME PARISH WE WEREN'T RENEWAL MINISTRIES HADN'T YET HAPPENED WITH US TOGETHER
YOU1000000033_S0000107	AND SO WE DECIDED TO PRAY AND THEN WE INVITED SISTER ANN AND A FEW OTHERS ONCE A WEEK TO PRAY WITH US AND WE PRAY EACH WEEK AND TRY TO LISTEN AND WEEK AFTER WE COULD SAY ANYBODY HEARING ANYTHING YOU KNOW FROM THE LORD NOW WHERE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GO NO
YOU1000000033_S0000108	AND THEN AT ONE POINT A COUPLE OF MONTHS INTO IT SISTER AND SHIELDS SAID AT THE END OF THE PARATIME SHE GOES THIS SOUNDS KIND OF STRANGE YOU GUYS BUT I THINK WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GO TO LITHUANIA AND UKRAINE
YOU1000000033_S0000109	SO HERE WE'RE IN THE BASEMENT OF A HOUSE HERE IN ANN ARBOR SISTER ANNE GETS A SENSE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GO TO LITHUANIA WE DON'T KNOW ANYBODY THERE TWO WEEKS LATER THE BISHOP OF THE CULTURAL CENTER OF THE COUNTRY CALLS US AND SAID WOULD YOU COME AND HELP ME
YOU1000000033_S0000110	AND WHAT WE HAD HEARD PROPHETICALLY FROM FOLKS WHO PRAYED FOR US SAID ONLY GO THROUGH DOORS THAT GOD'S GOING TO OPEN HE WILL OPEN THE DOORS FOR YOU IT STARTED IN LITHUANIA AND THEN IT WENT TO SLOVAKIA AND THEN IT WENT TO HUNGARY AND THEN IT WENT TO UKRAINE AND NOW IT'S FORTY COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD
YOU1000000033_S0000112	AND THAT'S KIND OF HOW IT ALL HAPPENED AND WE STARTED ONCE WE STARTED WE SAID OK CLEARLY GOD'S CALLING US WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO SO WE FORMED AN ORGANIZATION RENEWAL MINISTRIES THAT'S HOW IT HAPPENED
YOU1000000033_S0000114	THIS THOUGHT CAME INTO MY HEAD I WANT YOU ON CATHOLIC RADIO
YOU1000000033_S0000116	AND CATHOLIC RADIO
YOU1000000033_S0000118	DIDN'T EXIST EXCEPT FOR SOME WORK AT BUT THAT WAS IT
YOU1000000033_S0000120	AND IT WAS JUST I WANT YOU ON CATHOLIC RADIO AND I THOUGHT
YOU1000000033_S0000121	SO I WENT TO RALPH AND BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU GET SOME THOUGHT YOU KNOW IS IT INDIGESTION OR IS IT A WORD FROM THE LORD AND I SAID LOOK RALPH I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF CATHOLIC RADIO EXISTS
YOU1000000033_S0000123	AND HE SAID WELL LET'S LET'S JUST PRAY
YOU1000000033_S0000125	AND SIX MONTHS LATER I GOT THIS CALL FROM ASKING ME IF I WOULD BE WILLING TO DO A RADIO PROGRAM ON ON THEIR STATION AND I SAID YES
YOU1000000033_S0000126	AND THEY SAID DON'T DON'T YOU NEED TO TALK TO ANYBODY ABOUT THIS OR DON'T YOU NEED TO PRAY ABOUT THIS AND I SAID
YOU1000000033_S0000127	NO I THINK THE LORD PREPARED ME AND RALPH HAD SAID JUST PRAY IF IT IF SOMETHING HAPPENS AND WE'LL KNOW THIS IS FROM THE LORD
YOU1000000033_S0000128	MY RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY HAD PRAYED ABOUT IT KNEW ABOUT IT SO WHEN THE INVITATION CAME IT WAS LIKE ALL THE GROUNDWORK HAD BEEN RAISED SO HAD BEEN LAID SO FROM THEN ON I'VE THAT'S ONE OF THE MAIN THINGS I'VE BEEN DOING
YOU1000000033_S0000129	SPEAKING WRITING PARISH MISSIONS ALL OF THAT AND THEN PARTICULARLY FOCUSED ON THE RADIO
YOU1000000033_S0000130	WE GOT INTO RADIO WHICH WE HADN'T PLANNED AT THE BEGINNING SISTER AND PROGRAM FOOD FOR THE JOURNEY WHICH IS ALL OVER THE PLACE IN THE COUNTRY IS VERY DYNAMIC RADIO SHOW
YOU1000000033_S0000131	AND THEN A FEW YEARS AFTER THAT I FELT I WAS IN A MEETING WITH RALPH JUST CATCHING UP SEEING HOW THINGS ARE GOING HE SAID WHAT'S THE LORD SAYING THESE DAYS AND I SAID YOU KNOW CRAZY I THINK I'M SUPPOSED TO DO RADIO
YOU1000000033_S0000132	WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY MONEY FOR IT
YOU1000000033_S0000134	LET'S JUST SEE WHAT THE LORD DOES IF YOU'RE WILLING SO HE PRAYED AND THEN ABOUT A WEEK LATER I GOT A CALL FROM MIKE JONES FROM MARIA RADIO OUT OF THE BLUE AND HE SAID HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT DOING RADIO
YOU1000000033_S0000135	I SAID YEAH IN FACT I HAVE AND HE SAID WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO DO A SHOW WITH US I SAID DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY SAID WELL WE'LL DO IT WE'LL PRODUCE IT JUST COME AND DO THE SHOW SO STEP BY STEP THINGS LIKE THAT BEGAN TO HAPPEN
YOU1000000033_S0000136	CROSSING THE GOAL EMERGED A LEATHER TELEVISION SHOW ON EWTN THAT WE COLLABORATE TOGETHER WITH THE TEAM DANIEL BRANDWEIN CURTIS MARTIN VARIETY OF FOLKS A SHOW THAT WAS GEARED TOWARD MEN
YOU1000000033_S0000137	AND AGAIN IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS IN MY HEART FOR YEARS BEFORE I FELT LIKE THE LORD SAID
YOU1000000033_S0000139	YOU GOT TO START WORKING TO REACH MEN AND GIVE THEM CHALLENGE THEM TO DARE TO BELIEVE AND TO GO FOR IT AND I TRIED A FEW THINGS AND NOTHING REALLY TOOK OFF
YOU1000000033_S0000140	AND BUT IT WAS STILL IN MY HEART OUT OF THE BLUE DANNY AND I MET EACH OTHER ABRAMS AND OUR MINISTRIES WERE SO OUR DESIRES AND MINISTRY WERE SO COMMON WE ENDED UP COMBINING TOGETHER CREATING THIS OTHER SHOW SO THAT'S EMERGED
YOU1000000033_S0000141	ANOTHER IMPORTANT PIECE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING IS AND HAVE DONE FROM THE BEGINNING IS IS FIND A WAY TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE MORE LAY PEOPLE DIRECTLY IN MINISTRY AND EVANGELIZATION
YOU1000000033_S0000142	SO RAISED UP MORE AND MORE PEOPLE TO WORK WITH US INTERNATIONALLY ON MISSION TEAMS GOING ALL OVER THE WORLD OUR COUNTRY COORDINATORS WE CALL THEM
YOU1000000033_S0000143	AND THEN LAST FEW YEARS WITH WITH A HEART FOR MILLENNIALS WE JUST FELT LIKE THE LORD SAID THERE'S A ANN ARBOR AREA HERE THERE ARE LOTS OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE A SERIOUS CALL IN THEIR LIFE FROM THE LORD AND THEY'VE REALLY GROWN A LOT
YOU1000000033_S0000144	THEY JUST HAD A LOT OF SUPPORT AND FORMATION IN THEIR LIFE AND WE FELT LIKE THE LORD SAID HELP RELEASE THEM INTO WHAT I'VE CALLED THEM TO DO MAKE A WAY FOR THEM MAKE A PATH AND SO THAT'S PARTLY WHAT WE'VE DONE TOO THAT'S WHERE I D NINE SIXTEEN THE YOUNG ADULT MINISTRY EMERGED FROM
YOU1000000033_S0000145	ONE OF THE REALLY THINGS THE LORD HAS CALLED ALL OF US TO PETER AND SISTER ANNE AND MYSELF IS TO EXPRESS IN WRITING SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE FEEL LIKE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT TRUTHS THAT PEOPLE NEED TO HEAR RIGHT NOW IN OUR CULTURE
YOU1000000033_S0000146	AND SO LIKE FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS FOR ME WAS REALLY FINISHING A BOOK THAT I WORKED ON FOR TEN YEARS IT'S CALLED THE FULFILLMENT OF ALL DESIRE A GUIDEBOOK FOR THE JOURNEY TO GOD BASED ON THE WISDOM OF SAINTS
YOU1000000033_S0000147	JUST REALLY FELT LIKE THERE'S SUCH A TREASURE OF WISDOM IN OUR CHURCH IN THESE GREAT DOCTORS OF THE CHURCH BUT LIKE LIKE IT USED TO HAPPEN TO ME YEARS AGO THE FIRST TIME I PICKED UP A BOOK BY JOHN OF THE CROSS I WAS LIKE WHAT
YOU1000000033_S0000148	WHAT'S HE TALKING ABOUT AND WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT WAS SO SCARY I DECIDED TO PUT THE BOOK DOWN AND THEN TWENTY FIVE YEARS LATER IT'S JUST LIKE IT ALL KIND OF CAME ALIVE FOR ME AND SO I JUST REALLY FELT LIKE THIS TREMENDOUS STUFF HERE
YOU1000000033_S0000149	IF YOU COULD JUST COMMUNICATE IN A CLEAR ORDERLY UNDERSTANDABLE WAY PEOPLE WOULD GET SO MUCH HELP IN GROWING THEIR UNION WITH THE LORD
YOU1000000033_S0000150	PETER'S WRITTEN BOOKS LIKE THAT AND SISTER ANNE'S WRITTEN BOOKS LIKE THAT AND SO PART OF PART OF THE MINISTRY IS ALSO THE WRITING WHICH WHICH HAS HELPED AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE
YOU1000000033_S0000152	JOHN PAUL WAS A KIND OF SHEPHERD AND GUIDE FOR US HE WAS THE GUY WHO INTERPRETED FOR US WHAT THE SPIRIT IS SAYING TO THE CHURCH AND I CORRESPONDED WITH WHAT OUR SENSE WAS SO HE CONFIRMED US IN THE MISSION
YOU1000000033_S0000153	WE HAD GONE TO ROME WE WERE DOING A CONFERENCE IN ROME AND THE LAST NIGHT THAT WE WERE THERE WE GOT A PHONE CALL FROM THE HOLY FATHER JOHN PAUL ASKING IF WE WOULD LIKE TO COME TO HIS MASS THE NEXT MORNING
YOU1000000033_S0000154	YOU KNOW IT WAS LIKE LIKE TO YOU KNOW OF COURSE SO WE WE WENT THERE AND AFTER MASS WHEN HE CAME TO RALPH WHO WAS NEXT TO ME
YOU1000000033_S0000155	I GAVE HIM A COPY OF MY LATEST BOOK AT THE TIME CALLED THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AT THE END OF THE AGE WHAT IS THE SPIRIT SAYING HE TOOK THE BOOK AND HE SAID YOU KNOW I READ IT ALREADY I ALMOST FELL OVER ALMOST BECAME SPEECHLESS
YOU1000000033_S0000156	THEN HE TURNED TO RALPH AND HE TOOK RALPH BY THE UPPER ARMS HE JUST TOOK HIM AND KIND OF SHOOK HIM LIKE THIS AND HE SAID RALPH TELL ME WHAT IS THE SPIRIT SAYING TO THE CHURCH
YOU1000000033_S0000158	I KNEW HE DIDN'T WANT THE WHOLE THREE HUNDRED PAGE ANSWER SO I SAID HOLY FATHER I THINK WHAT THE SPIRIT IS SAYING TO THE CHURCH IS JESUS SO HE TOOK MY HAND AND HE SAID JESUS AND I SAID JESUS
YOU1000000033_S0000159	WE JUST STOOD THERE FOR A COUPLE MINUTES SAYING THE NAME OF JESUS AND IT WAS JUST A VERY VERY SPECIAL MOMENT OF COMMUNION WITH THE LORD AND COMMUNION WITH THE POPE AND JUST PROCLAIMING THE NAME OF JESUS TOGETHER WAS JUST VERY VERY SPECIAL
YOU1000000033_S0000160	JOHN PAUL THE SECOND IS OUR PATRON YOU KNOW ONE OF OUR ONE OF OUR CENTRAL THE CENTRAL PATRON MAYBE OF RENEWAL MINISTRIES AND SO HE'S A GREAT INTERCESSOR FOR US WE CONTINUE TO PRAY WE ASK FOR HIS HELP I FEEL HIS PRESENCE ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M ON MISSION INTERNATIONALLY
YOU1000000033_S0000161	IN A VERY SPECIAL WAY WE'VE ASKED ST JOHN PAUL THE SECOND TO BE OUR PATREON WE ALSO ASK MARY
YOU1000000033_S0000162	YOU KNOW SHE'S THE QUEEN OF THE NEW EVANGELIZATION SHE'S SHE'S APPEARING IN THE WORLD SHE'S SHE'S CARRYING FORTH THE MESSAGE SHE'S SORT OF LIKE LEADING THE CHARGE IN MANY WAYS
YOU1000000033_S0000163	AND WE WE PRAY WE TRY TO STAY CLOSE WE TRY TO LISTEN YOU KNOW TO WHAT'S HAPPENING THROUGH THE APPARITIONS THAT ARE ACCEPTED BY THE CHURCH AND WHAT'S THE MESSAGE THERE AS WELL BECAUSE IT'S PROPHETIC
YOU1000000033_S0000164	IT'S A PROPHETIC MESSAGE AND WE FEEL LIKE WE ARE A PROPHETIC MINISTRY IN PART YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE MEANT TO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WE'RE MEANT TO REALLY DIAL IN TO TRY TO HEAR WHAT THE SPIRIT IS SAYING TO THE CHURCH TODAY AND TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE THAT TO OTHER PEOPLE
YOU1000000033_S0000165	WHAT DOES GOD WANT
YOU1000000033_S0000167	FROM US WHO ARE HIS SONS AND DAUGHTERS HOW ARE WE CALLED TO LIVE IN THIS GENERATION IN THIS TIME AND ALL OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE CERTAINLY BEGINNING TO FACE
YOU1000000033_S0000168	BECAUSE RIGHT NOW SEVENTEEN HUNDRED YEARS OF CHRISTIAN CULTURE IS COLLAPSING ALL KINDS OF SUPPORTS THAT USED TO BE THERE FOR LIVING A MORAL LIFE FOR ALL KINDS OF RESPECT THAT USED TO BE THERE FOR THE CHURCH FOR THE SYNAGOGUE WHATEVER JUST ISN'T THERE ANYMORE
YOU1000000033_S0000169	AND MORE AND MORE WE'RE LIVING IN THE GROWTH OF AN INTERNATIONAL PAGAN CULTURE THAT'S BECOMING INCREASINGLY HOSTILE TO CHRIST AND THE CHURCH WHERE IS THEIR LOYALTY
YOU1000000033_S0000170	WHAT DO THEY REALLY THINK ABOUT JESUS CHRIST ARE THEY WILLING TO SUFFER FOR HIM ARE THEY WILLING TO SUFFER RATHER THAN TO DENY HIM ARE THEY WILLING TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO PASS ON THE FAITH TO THEIR CHILDREN
YOU1000000033_S0000171	EVEN WHEN THE CULTURE IS PLACING TREMENDOUS OBSTACLES IN FRONT OF IT SO WE'RE LIVING IN QUITE A TIME OF CONFLICT AND DECISION IT'S FOR SUCH A TIME AS THIS THAT WE'VE BEEN CALLED TO DO WHAT WE'RE DOING
YOU1000000033_S0000172	I HOPE THAT RENEWAL MINISTRIES CAN HELP PEOPLE MAKE THE DECISION THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE FRIENDS OF JESUS CHRIST AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE LOYAL TO HIM EVEN IN THE MIDST OF TREMENDOUS OPPRESSION AND DIFFICULTIES
YOU1000000033_S0000173	THE CULTURE IS LETHAL
YOU1000000033_S0000175	RIGHT NOW IT'S IT'S NOT JUST KIND OF YOU KNOW ENTICING YOU
YOU1000000033_S0000176	IT'S IT'S JUST TAKING PEOPLE AND TAKING THEM RIGHT OUT OF THE FRAMEWORK IN WHICH THEY'VE LIVED WITH THE LITTLE FAITH THAT PERHAPS THEY'VE HAD
YOU1000000033_S0000177	EVEN IF THEIR FAITH IS STRONG THE ENTICEMENTS OF THE WORLD ARE NOW SO STRONG THAT IF PEOPLE AREN'T REALLY ROOTED IN GOD THEY CAN THEY CAN EASILY BE PULLED OUT WITHOUT EVEN REALIZING AT FIRST WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THEM

YOU1000000039_S0000075	BUT THROUGH PATTERNING AND EXPERIENCE I WAS FULLY CONFIDENT SHE'D TAKE THAT TOM DOWN
YOU1000000039_S0000077	BASED ON THE SPUR LENGTH ABOUT AN INCH AND THREE SIXTEENTHS THE TOM'S PROBABLY THREE YEARS OLD THAT'S A GOOD TOM ANYWHERE BUT IT WAS EVEN BETTER HUNT BIRDS GOBBLED GOOD RESPONDED TO THE CALL AND THERE WAS PLENTY OF EXCITEMENT AS THEY WERE APPROACHING
YOU1000000039_S0000078	MORE IMPORTANTLY IT WAS JUST A FUN HUNT TO SHARE WITH MY DAUGHTER
YOU1000000039_S0000080	AFTER EVERY SUCCESSFUL HUNT I LIKE TO TAKE A LITTLE TIME AND SEE WHAT THE CRITTER HAS BEEN EATING I CALL THIS SCOUTING FROM THE SKIES
YOU1000000039_S0000082	TWENTY THREE AND A HALF TWENTY THREE AND A HALF GOOD TIME FOR THE OZARKS IT'S EASY TIN LITTLE BIT OVER TEN INCHES ON THE BEARD
YOU1000000039_S0000083	SHARING HUNT WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND JUST AS IMPORTANT IS PROPERLY PREPARING THE MEAT WE ALL SHOULD BE THANKFUL WHEN WE HARVEST GAME AND THAT NATURAL SOURCE OF MEAT TO FEED OUR FAMILIES FIRST THING DUE COURSE IS REMOVE THE BEARD
YOU1000000039_S0000085	JUST PUT MY HAND AT THE BASE AND GIVE IT A GOOD TUG
YOU1000000039_S0000087	IT IS NICE FULL BEARD TURN THE TURKEY UP RIGHT WHERE HIS BREASTBONE TO HIM AND I JUST WANT TO OPEN UP AND SEE WHAT'S IN HIS CROP OR PROBABLY NOT MUCH BECAUSE WE CALLED THIS TURKEY RIGHT OFF THE ROOTS WE COULD HEAR HIM IN THE TREE HEAR HIM HIT THE GROUND

YOU1000000039_S0000096	PARTLY THAT OLD TOM CAME OFF THE ROOST AND STARTED WORKING RIGHT TOWARD OUR SETUP
YOU1000000039_S0000098	USUALLY WHEN YOU OPEN UP A DEER'S STOMACH OR TURKEY'S CROP THERE'S GREAT INFORMATION THAT TELLS US WHERE TURKEYS ARE SPENDING TIME EATING BUT WHEN YOU SHOOT TOM THAT CAME TO YOU RIGHT OFF THE ROOST OFTENTIMES THERE WOULD BE NOTHING IN HIS CROP

YOU1000000039_S0000116	AFTER A COUPLE HOURS OF WALKING AROUND AND CALLING THEY CAN'T HEAR ANY TURKEYS RESPOND DUE TO THE HIGH WIND SO HE DECIDES THEY NEED TO FIND A HIGH SPOT THAT'S OUT OF THE WIND AND SEE IF THEY CAN HEAR A TURKEY RESPOND

YOU1000000039_S0000133	THEY ENDED UP MOVING FURTHER INTO PROPERTY AND HAVING A GOBBLER RESPOND TO THEIR CALLS THEY SCRAMBLED TO GET SETUP BUT THIS TOM WORKED HIS WAY IN SILENTLY AND WOULDN'T GIVE KATE A GOOD SHOT
YOU1000000039_S0000135	IT WAS A FUN DAY WITH SOME GOOD INTERACTIONS BUT NEITHER GRACE OR CADE TAGGED THE TURKEY BUT THEY WERE READY TO GO THE NEXT MORNING

YOU1000000039_S0000169	REQUIRES PATIENCE REQUIRES A LITTLE UNDERSTANDING KNOWLEDGE OF YOUR YOUR ADVERSARY IN THE WOODS IF YOU GET DOWN TO THE MOST BASIC THINGS OF TURKEY HONEY IT CAN REALLY TEACH YOU SOME LESSONS IN LIFE
YOU1000000039_S0000170	I'M STILL TRYING TO LEARN THE PATIENT THING THAT STILL STUCK WITH
YOU1000000039_S0000172	YOU MANAGED TO GET A BURGER FOR GRACE TO KILL HER
YOU1000000039_S0000174	THERE'S A LOT OF EMOTIONS INVOLVED IN TAKING ANYONE HONEY YOUTH OR ADULT NEW OR EXPERIENCED HUNTER THERE'S ENJOYING CREATION THERE'S THE POTENTIAL AND FOLLOW THROUGH OF TAKING THE LIFE OF ANOTHER CRITTER
YOU1000000039_S0000175	THERE'S THE JOY OF PROVIDING QUALITY FOOD FOR YOUR FAMILY I CAN'T THINK OF ANY BETTER TOOL THAN HUNTING FOR TEACHING LIFE'S LESSONS
YOU1000000039_S0000176	THANKS TO HETH LINDSEY AND SCOTT FOR VOLUNTEERING THEIR TIME TO INTRODUCE SEVERAL YOUTHS TO HUNTING THIS PAST WEEKEND IN ARKANSAS

YOU1000000039_S0000189	SO DO NOT MOVE A LOT UNTIL I GET IN FRONT OF YOUR GUN BARREL
YOU1000000039_S0000191	ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF TAKING A YOUTH HUNTING IS GETTING THEM SET UP RIGHT IN PREDICTING WHERE THE TURKEY IS GOING TO APPROACH
YOU1000000039_S0000193	WHY DIDN'T I JUST PUT THE GUN DOWN THE LOGGING ROAD WHEN WE GOT HERE AND I SEEN HIM COMING UP THE ROAD I WAS LIKE

YOU1000000039_S0000211	TURKEYS WOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD
YOU1000000039_S0000213	ONE REASON WE'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING SOME GREAT TURKEY HUNT HERE AT THE PROVING GROUND IS OUR INTENSIVE PREDATOR MANAGEMENT PROGRAM

YOU1000000043_S0000194	AS I SAID A GROUP OF ACCOUNTS AND IT WILL HAVE ALL THESE DIFFERENT ARTICLES THAT IT PLUGS FROM ALL THESE DIFFERENT CONTENT WEBSITES OBVIOUSLY NOT CNN BECAUSE THAT ONE DOESN'T WORK SO WELL
YOU1000000043_S0000195	BUT ANY OTHER CONTENT WEBSITE THAT DOES WORK WELL I'M ASSUMING THAT THE CONTENT STREAMS THAT ACTUALLY AUTOMATICALLY GET CONTENT THEY USE WEBSITES WHERE IT WORKS FLAWLESSLY
YOU1000000043_S0000196	IT'S JUST THAT THE CNN WEBSITE SEEMS TO BLOCK OVERLAYS ON THEIR OWN WEBSITE
YOU1000000043_S0000198	AND THEN OF COURSE IT PULLS ALL THAT DIFFERENT CONTENT AND THEN POST IT ON YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA
YOU1000000043_S0000199	AND THEN WHEN PEOPLE CLICK ON THOSE DIFFERENT LINKS THEY WILL BE PRESENTED WITH YOUR POP UPS WITH YOUR OVERLAYS
YOU1000000043_S0000200	SO THEY CAN SIGN UP TO YOUR LIST OR GO TO YOUR AFFILIATE OFFERS AND YOU DIRECTLY MAKE MONEY WITH THAT CONTENT

YOU1000000043_S0000232	CONSIDERING THAT GIVES YOU THREE MONTHS FOR ONLY TEN BUCKS MORE IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE ANY SENSE TO GET THE MONTHLY PAYMENTS BECAUSE YOU END UP PAYING ALMOST THREE TIMES AS MUCH
YOU1000000043_S0000233	SO MAKE SURE YOU GET THE QUARTERLY FOR FORTY SEVEN DOLLARS AND YOU'LL ALSO BE ABLE TO SET THIS UP FOR YOUR CLIENT
YOU1000000043_S0000234	IF YOU ARE AN AGENCY IF YOU DO DIGITAL MARKETING FOR CLIENTS THEN YOU CAN USE SOCIABLE TO DRIVE TRAFFIC TO THEIR OFFERS SO YOU CAN OFFER THIS AS A SERVICE
YOU1000000043_S0000235	AND THEN IT DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE THAT YOU'RE PAYING FORTY SEVEN DOLLARS PER QUARTER FOR THIS BECAUSE YOU CAN CHARGE YOUR CLIENTS LIKE A HUNDRED BUCKS A MONTH
YOU1000000043_S0000236	AND EVEN WITH JUST ONE CLIENT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO CHARGE THREE HUNDRED BUCKS PER QUARTER AND YOU'RE ONLY PAYING FORTY SEVEN TO OFFER THEM THIS SERVICE SO THIS MAKES THIS REALLY REALLY GOOD DEAL

YOU1000000043_S0000240	BECAUSE THEN YOUR CLIENTS MIGHT JUST GO TO SOCIABLE DIRECTLY AND SKIP YOU AS AN INTERMEDIARY
YOU1000000043_S0000241	SO IF YOU'RE GONNA DO THAT YOU CAN BASICALLY REBRAND SOCIABLE GIVE IT ANY NAME YOU WANT OR THE NAME OF YOUR OWN AGENCY AND THAT IS A ONE TIME PAYMENT OF NINETY SEVEN DOLLARS ALLOWING YOU THAT FUNCTION

YOU1000000045_S0000027	I DIDN'T KNOW IF IT WAS GOING TO BE A BOOK ABOUT AMERICAN WOMEN A BOOK ABOUT POLITICAL WOMEN BUT IT'S JUST A BOOK ABOUT WOMEN WHO HAVE CHANGED NOT JUST THEIR WORLD BUT THE WORLD IN SOME WAY SHAPE OR FORM
YOU1000000045_S0000028	WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT YOU WROTE IT TOGETHER YOU'VE WRITTEN MANY BOOKS SEPARATELY BUT THIS WAS YOUR FIRST BOOK WRITING TOGETHER AS A MOTHER AND DAUGHTER
YOU1000000045_S0000029	SOMEONE WHO'S WRITTEN A BOOK WITHOUT MY MOTHER I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT WOULD BE LIKE TO WRITE SOMETHING WITH MY MOTHER
YOU1000000045_S0000030	HOW DO YOU WHY YOU'RE STARING DO YOU NOT HAVE EACH OTHER AT THIS POINT WHAT IS THE PROCESS LIKE

YOU1000000045_S0000044	FEEL YOUR FRUSTRATION AS YOU'RE TELLING THE STORY STILL WORKING THROUGH THIS AND I CAN FEEL THAT
YOU1000000045_S0000045	WHY DID YOU CHOOSE TO WRITE THIS BOOK TOGETHER I MEAN YOU'VE HAD MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO COULD'VE WRITTEN ABOUT ANYTHING YOUR FAMILY POLITICS YOU
YOU1000000045_S0000046	THIS IS A SPECIFIC BOOK AND IT FEELS LIKE FOR A SPECIFIC TIME WHY
YOU1000000045_S0000048	BECAUSE WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT IN TODAY'S WORLD THE STORIES OF GUTSY WOMEN AND LITERALLY THERE ARE MANY MILLIONS OF THEM
YOU1000000045_S0000049	BUT WE CHOSE A HUNDRED AND THREE TO WRITE ABOUT
YOU1000000045_S0000050	BECAUSE THEIR STORIES TELL US YES ABOUT THE STRUGGLES THAT THEY ENDURED
YOU1000000045_S0000051	AND THEIR PERSISTENCE TO TRY TO IMPROVE THEIR OWN LIVES AND THE LIVES OF PEOPLE AROUND THEM
YOU1000000045_S0000052	I THINK ESPECIALLY IN TODAY'S WORLD WE NEED TO BE REMINDED OF THESE KINDS OF STORIES AND THEY ARE HISTORIC AND CONTEMPORARY AND EVEN A FEW FICTIONAL
YOU1000000045_S0000053	AND THEY WERE WOMEN WHO INSPIRED ME AS A LITTLE GIRL AND THEN THROUGHOUT MY LIFE AND THE SAME WITH ELSE AND
YOU1000000045_S0000054	FACT WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW INSPIRATIONAL WOMEN WHEN SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL
YOU1000000045_S0000055	AND SO WE WANT TO SHARE THESE STORIES AND WE HOPE THAT PEOPLE CAN FIND SOME SOME MESSAGE THAT WILL HELP THEM
YOU1000000045_S0000056	
YOU1000000045_S0000057	ESPECIALLY YOU KNOW GIVEN THE DIFFICULTIES THAT A LOT OF A LOT OF PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD FACE RIGHT NOW
YOU1000000045_S0000058	IT'S INTERESTING CHELSEA BECAUSE YOU'VE SAID YOU KNOW THERE WAS A TIME IN YOUR LIFE WHEN YOU WATCHED YOUR MOM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AND THERE WERE MORE WOMEN IN SPACE THAN RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT
YOU1000000045_S0000059	TWO
YOU1000000045_S0000060	RIGHT AND NOW YOU YOU HAVE A PLETHORA OF WOMEN I MEAN YOU HAVE SIX IN THE RACE AND YOU'VE SEEN HOW MANY WOMEN PARTICIPATED IN IN THE MIDTERMS AND ONE AS WELL
YOU1000000045_S0000061	DO YOU FEEL LIKE WE'RE NOTICING A SHIFT IN SOCIETY THAT'S POSITIVELY MOVING US TO A PLACE WHERE THERE'S EQUALITY NOT THERE YET BUT JUST MOVING US IN THAT DIRECTION
YOU1000000045_S0000062	I THINK WE'RE ABSOLUTELY MAKING PROGRESS I ALSO REALLY APPRECIATE HOW YOU FRAMED THE QUESTION TREVOR BECAUSE IT'S SUPER IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T GET COMPLACENT
YOU1000000045_S0000063	AND THAT WE ALSO UNDERSTAND STILL HOW FAR WE HAVE TO GO
YOU1000000045_S0000064	EVEN THOUGH WE HAD AN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF WOMEN RUN FOR CONGRESS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE WERE STILL LESS THAN A QUARTER OF ALL DECLARED CANDIDATES
YOU1000000045_S0000065	WOW
YOU1000000045_S0000066	SO MAKING PROGRESS BUT WE STILL HAVE A LONG WAYS TO GO TO GET TO PARODY BUT AS WE'VE SEEN LIKE WHO RUNS FOR OFFICE REALLY MATTERS BECAUSE IT DETERMINES WHO HOLDS OFFICE
YOU1000000045_S0000067	I'M SO THRILLED THAT MY CHILDREN ARE GROWING UP WITH THE MOST DIVERSE CONGRESS IN AMERICAN HISTORY
YOU1000000045_S0000068	YOU HAVE CHOSEN A HUNDRED AND THREE WOMEN IN THIS BOOK WHO ALL HAVE DIFFERENT STORIES OF BEING GUTS BUT WHAT WOULD YOU FIND WAS THE COMMON THREAD THAT MADE THEM WHO THEY ARE
YOU1000000045_S0000069	ONE I THINK THE SENSE OF JUST DEEP PURPOSE SOMETIMES SOMETHING THAT THEY KNEW FROM WHEN THEY WERE LITTLE GIRL
YOU1000000045_S0000070	JANE GOODALL ALWAYS KNEW SHE WANTED TO WORK WITH ANIMALS AND SALLY RIDE AND THE FIRST AMERICAN WOMAN IN SPACE
YOU1000000045_S0000071	REALLY BECAME A PHYSICIST BECAUSE SHE WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH TENNIS PLAYER SO SHE KIND OF FOUND HER PASSION LATER IN LIFE
YOU1000000045_S0000072	WHAT IS SO DISTINCTIVE ABOUT ALL THESE WOMEN IS THAT THEY BROUGHT OTHERS ALONG WITH THEM
YOU1000000045_S0000073	SOMETIMES CONSCIOUSLY BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS AND SOMETIMES JUST REALLY AWARE OF THEIR EXAMPLE
YOU1000000045_S0000074	AND I FIND THAT REALLY POWERFUL AND GUTSY THAT IT WASN'T JUST FOR THEMSELVES IT WAS FOR OTHERS TOO
YOU1000000045_S0000075	HILLARY I HAVE TO ASK YOU A QUESTION THAT HAS BEEN PLAGUING ME FOR A WHILE HOW DID YOU KILL JEFFREY EPSTEIN
YOU1000000045_S0000077	BECAUSE YOU YOU YOU'RE NOT IN POWER BUT YOU HAVE ALL THE POWER
YOU1000000045_S0000079	I REALLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW YOU DO WHAT YOU DO
YOU1000000045_S0000080	BECAUSE YOU SEEM TO BE BEHIND EVERYTHING NEFARIOUS AND YET YOU DO NOT USE IT TO BECOME PRESIDENT WHAT IS THE GAME PLAN
YOU1000000045_S0000082	WELL TREVOR
YOU1000000045_S0000084	WHAT IS HONESTLY WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE BEING THE BOGEYMAN OF THE RIGHT
YOU1000000045_S0000085	WELL IT'S IT'S A CONSTANT SURPRISE TO ME
YOU1000000045_S0000086	BECAUSE THE THINGS THEY SAY AND NOW OF COURSE IT'S ON STEROIDS WITH BEING ONLINE
YOU1000000045_S0000087	ARE SO RIDICULOUS BEYOND ANY IMAGINATION THAT I COULD HAVE
YOU1000000045_S0000088	AND YET THEY ARE SO PERSISTENT IN PUTTING FORTH THESE CRAZY IDEAS AND THEORIES
YOU1000000045_S0000089	HONESTLY I DON'T KNOW WHAT I EVER DID TO GET THEM SO UPSET
YOU1000000045_S0000090	BUT A LOT OF THEM LIVE TO COME UP WITH THESE CONSPIRACY THEORIES
YOU1000000045_S0000091	AND YOU KNOW I'VE GOTTEN KIND OF USED TO IT IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS
YOU1000000045_S0000092	HAVE YOU HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT OF JUST LIKE MEETING SOMEONE WHO SAYS LIKE HEY YOU DID THIS AND JUST LOOKING AT THEM AND BEING LIKE YES I DID
YOU1000000045_S0000094	I MEAN THERE MUST AT SOME POINT RIGHT AT SOME AT SOME POINT IT BECOMES SO LUDICROUS AND IT BECOMES SO EXTREME
YOU1000000045_S0000095	I'VE HAD I'VE HAD ENCOUNTERS LIKE THAT AND AND MANY OF MY FRIENDS HAVE HAD BECAUSE
YOU1000000045_S0000096	WOW
YOU1000000045_S0000097	YEAH THEY'VE CALLED UP PEOPLE TO URGE THEM TO LIKE VOTE FOR
YOU1000000045_S0000098	THEY'VE KNOCKED ON A DOOR AND SOMEBODY WILL SAY OH I COULDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE THEN THEY LAUNCH INTO ONE OF THEIR BIG CONSPIRACIES
YOU1000000045_S0000099	AND I HAD ONE FRIEND ONE VERY DEAR FRIEND WHO I LITERALLY HAVE KNOWN MY ENTIRE LIFE AND SHE SAID SHE LISTENED TO THIS RIDICULOUS CONSPIRACY ABOUT ME
YOU1000000045_S0000100	AND SHE SAID YOU KNOW I'VE KNOWN HER SINCE WE WERE IN SIXTH GRADE AND NONE OF THAT IS TRUE AND THIS MAN LOOKED AT HER AND SAID BUT I SAW IT ON THE INTERNET
YOU1000000045_S0000102	BUT I ALSO THINK IT'S BECAUSE IT IS EFFECTIVE LIKE I'LL NEVER FORGET READING AN ARTICLE AFTER THE TWENTY SIXTEEN ELECTION
YOU1000000045_S0000103	WHERE THE REPORTER INTERVIEWED SOMEONE WHO HAD BEEN AN UNDECIDED VOTER
YOU1000000045_S0000104	HE SAID YOU KNOW HE THOUGHT MY MOM HAD WON ALL THREE DEBATES SHE CLEARLY HAD GREATER COMMAND OF THE SUBJECT MATTER AND YET HE JUST KEPT READING THAT SHE HAD MURDERED MORE THAN FIFTY PEOPLE
YOU1000000045_S0000105	AND HE SAID SOMEWHAT NONCHALANTLY LIKE I DON'T THINK THAT SHE MURDERED FIFTY BUT LIKE WHAT IF SHE MURDERED TOO
YOU1000000045_S0000106	SO YOU JUST THINK IT'S THIS LIKE CONSTANT EROSION OF OF TRUTH AND SANITY
YOU1000000045_S0000107	
YOU1000000045_S0000108	MY FAVORITE AND THE ONE THAT I DO SECRETLY HOPE MAY BE TRUE IS THAT MY MOTHER APPARENTLY ADOPTED AN ALIEN IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE AND I'VE ALWAYS WANTED A SIBLING
YOU1000000045_S0000109	MAYBE MAYBE THAT ONE WILL PROVE OUT
YOU1000000045_S0000110	IT'S YOU HAVE TO LAUGH AT IT BECAUSE IT'S SO CRAZY BUT ON THE OTHER HAND WE FACE A SERIOUS PROBLEM
YOU1000000045_S0000111	OF A LOT OF THESE FALSEHOODS AND THESE CRAZY STORIES TAKING ON LIVES OF THEIR OWN
YOU1000000045_S0000112	NOT ABOUT ME BUT ABOUT EVERYBODY PARTICULARLY ANYBODY IN THE PUBLIC ARENA
YOU1000000045_S0000113	AND I HAVE BEEN VERY OUTSPOKEN ABOUT THE DECISION BY FACEBOOK TO ALLOW TRULY FALSE POLITICAL ADS TO BE RUN
YOU1000000045_S0000114	I WANT TO APPLAUD TWITTER FOR ANNOUNCING THEY WERE NOT GOING TO LET THAT GO FORWARD AND I HOPE I REALLY HOPE FACEBOOK CHANGES THEIR MIND
YOU1000000045_S0000115	BECAUSE MORE THAN HALF THE PEOPLE IN AMERICA GET THEIR NEWS FROM FACEBOOK AND YOU I MEAN THAT'S
YOU1000000045_S0000116	BUT FACEBOOK FACEBOOK IS IS IS A REAL ISSUE AND WE ARE LIVING IN A WORLD WHERE PEOPLE NO LONGER KNOW WHAT TRUTH IS AND DON'T EVEN AGREE ON IT WHICH WHICH SEEMS TO BE A LARGER ISSUE
YOU1000000045_S0000117	YOU'VE WITNESSED THE CHANGE IN POLITICS THROUGH MANY DIFFERENT TIMES
YOU1000000045_S0000118	IN FACT WE'RE IN AN INTERESTING PERIOD NOW WHERE THE COUNTRY IS GEARING UP FOR IMPEACHMENT
YOU1000000045_S0000119	AND YOU ARE IN AN INTERESTING POSITION WHERE IN YOUR LIFE YOU HAVE BEEN LITERALLY A PART OF EVERY SINGLE IMPEACHMENT IN SOME WAY SHAPE OR FORM
YOU1000000045_S0000120	YOU HAD THE WATERGATE INVESTIGATION THAT YOU WERE A PART OF YOU THEN HAD YOUR HUSBAND WHO WAS IMPEACHED AND NOW YOUR POLITICAL OPPONENT IS GETTING IMPEACHED
YOU1000000045_S0000121	DO YOU HAVE THE IMPEACHMENT TOUCH IS THIS LIKE
YOU1000000045_S0000122	YOU KNOW I WASN'T PART OF ANDREW JOHNSON BUT YOU KNOW OTHER THAN THAT YES
YOU1000000045_S0000123	IT IS A STRANGE PERSPECTIVE TO HAVE BECAUSE I WAS A YOUNG LAWYER INVESTIGATING RICHARD NIXON
YOU1000000045_S0000124	AND I AM VERY PLEASED THAT THE HOUSE TODAY IS PROCEEDING IN SUCH A DELIBERATIVE MANNER THEY HAD THAT VOTE TODAY ABOUT THE PROCEDURES
YOU1000000045_S0000125	BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR AT FIRST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE LOOKED AT THE IDEA THAT NIXON WOULD BE IMPEACHED AFTER HE WON A MASSIVE LANDSLIDE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO
YOU1000000045_S0000126	THEY THOUGHT WELL THAT THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE BUT AS THE EVIDENCE CAME OUT AND WE WERE LITERALLY WORKING EIGHTEEN HOURS A DAY
YOU1000000045_S0000127	COMPILING EVIDENCE MAKING YOU KNOW THE LEGAL ARGUMENTS THE CONSTITUTIONAL ARGUMENTS
YOU1000000045_S0000128	AND FINALLY PEOPLE REALIZED THAT
YOU1000000045_S0000129	YEAH OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE ABUSE OF POWER CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS ARE NOT WHAT WE WANT TO TURN A BLIND EYE TO IN OUR COUNTRY
YOU1000000045_S0000130	WE NEED CHECKS AND BALANCES IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE RULE OF LAW IS AT THE CORE OF OUR DEMOCRACY
YOU1000000045_S0000131	SO I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE ABOUT HOW THE HOUSE'S POWER IS SUPPOSED TO WORK
YOU1000000045_S0000132	I WAS PART OF SEEING IT WORK I BELIEVE IN THE RIGHT WAY ONE OF THE PEOPLE WE PROFILE BARBARA JORDAN
YOU1000000045_S0000133	IF YOU GO TO YOUTUBE YOU CAN SEE HER SPEECH WHEN SHE VOTED ON THE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR WITH HER DEFENSE OF THE CONSTITUTION
YOU1000000045_S0000134	AND SO I'M HOPING THAT NOW THAT THIS IS GOING TO MOVE TOWARD PUBLIC HEARINGS
YOU1000000045_S0000135	WHERE PEOPLE CAN SEE THESE WITNESSES IN PERSON THEY CAN BE LIKE A JUROR THEMSELVES TRYING TO DECIDE
YOU1000000045_S0000136	THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL YOU KNOW MAKE A VERY CAREFUL STUDY OF WHAT THEY'RE BEING TOLD
YOU1000000045_S0000137	BECAUSE THE FOUNDERS PUT IMPEACHMENT IN THE CONSTITUTION FOR A REASON
YOU1000000045_S0000138	WE HAVE ELECTIONS BUT IN BETWEEN ELECTIONS IF THERE'S BEHAVIOR THAT IS UNDERMINING OUR COUNTRY ENDANGERING OUR NATIONAL SECURITY
YOU1000000045_S0000139	AS THE ALLEGATIONS HERE ARE IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY REMEDY BUT ONE THAT HAS TO BE EXERCISED IN A SOBER CAREFUL WAY
YOU1000000045_S0000140	IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE AMERICA IS IN A PLACE WHERE IT FEELS LIKE THIS PROCESS AND PROCEDURE WILL BE TESTED MORE THAN EVER BEFORE BECAUSE OF HOW PARTIES IN AMERICA HAS BECOME
YOU1000000045_S0000141	BECAUSE OF HOW YOU KNOW TOXIC POLITICS IN AMERICA HAS BECOME
YOU1000000045_S0000142	AND I WAS INTERESTED IN CHELSEA BECAUSE I'VE NOTICED A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE ASKED YOU WHY YOU AREN'T RUNNING FOR AN OPEN SEAT IN CHAPPAQUA
YOU1000000045_S0000143	YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF NEW YORK STATE THERE IS A SEAT THAT IS OPEN AND YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO TAKE THAT SEAT IN MANY PEOPLE'S OPINION
YOU1000000045_S0000144	AND YOU'VE OFTEN SAID NO THERE'S OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE WHO COULD TAKE IT AND EVERYONE SAID YES BUT YOU WOULD DEFINITELY YOU KNOW TAKE THAT SEAT AND YOU WOULD RUN WITH IT AND YOU'VE SAID YOU'RE INTERESTED IN CHANGING PEOPLE'S LIVES
YOU1000000045_S0000145	DO YOU HAVE A HESITANT HESITANCY TO ENGAGE IN POLITICS BECAUSE OF HOW YOUR MOM HAS BEEN TREATED IN HER LIFE
YOU1000000045_S0000146	NO BECAUSE I SEE HER GET UP EVERY DAY AND STILL ENGAGE
YOU1000000045_S0000147	AND SO FOR ME THE DECISION TO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT KIND OF RUNNING FOR
YOU1000000045_S0000148	THE SEAT THAT CONGRESSWOMAN NITA LOWEY WILL LEAVE AT THE END OF NEXT YEAR
YOU1000000045_S0000149	IS MORE ABOUT AN AFFIRMATION OF WHAT I'M DOING NOW
YOU1000000045_S0000150	AND I'M THRILLED THAT THERE ARE ALREADY SO MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE THROWN THEIR HATS INTO THE
YOU1000000045_S0000151	I HOPE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T KIND OF SEE THE TOXICITY IN THIS MOMENT AND TURN AWAY FROM IT I HOPE THEY SEE IT AND SAY I WANT TO CHANGE THAT
YOU1000000045_S0000152	AND I WANT TO GET BACK TO A PLACE OF SCIENCE AND EVIDENCE BASED DECISIONS AND RESPECT FOR OUR DEMOCRACY AND RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW
YOU1000000045_S0000153	SO I HOPE PEOPLE TAKE IT PERVERSELY AS AN OPPORTUNITY
YOU1000000045_S0000154	
YOU1000000045_S0000155	FOR WHAT MUST BE DIFFERENT AND THEN BE PART OF THE CHANGE OF DOING
YOU1000000045_S0000156	BECAUSE IT HASN'T YOU KNOW IT HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THAT WE'VE HAD PARTIN PARTISANSHIP FROM THE VERY BEGINNING
YOU1000000045_S0000157	BUT THERE'S ALSO BEEN A LOT OF EFFORT TO FIND COMMON GROUND SO BACK TO THE NIXON IMPEACHMENT
YOU1000000045_S0000158	WHEN THE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT WERE VOTED ON MEMBERS OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN THE CONGRESS VOTED FOR ONE OR MORE OF
YOU1000000045_S0000159	SO THERE HAS BEEN MANY TIMES
YOU1000000045_S0000160	WRITE ABOUT MARGARET CHASE SMITH A REPUBLICAN WOMAN SENATOR FROM MAINE WHO WAS THE FIRST MEMBER OF HER PARTY TO STAND UP TO JOSEPH MCCARTHY IN THE EARLY NINETEEN FIFTY S
YOU1000000045_S0000161	SO WE'VE HAD NOT ONLY PEOPLE BUT A CONSENSUS AROUND WHAT IT IS WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT AND CHERISH
YOU1000000045_S0000162	AND SO I CAN HOPE THAT MAYBE THERE'LL BE ENOUGH PEOPLE WHO MAKE THEIR DECISION NOT ON YOU KNOW PROTECTING THE PRESIDENT BUT PROTECTING THE COUNTRY
YOU1000000045_S0000163	EITHER WAY THEY END UP
YOU1000000045_S0000164	IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE MANY OF THE WOMEN YOU'VE WRITTEN ABOUT IN THE BOOK ALSO SHARE ONE COMMON TRAIT AND THAT IS THE OBSTACLES THEY HAD TO OVERCOME
YOU1000000045_S0000165	OFTEN INCLUDED BEING ACCUSED OF THINGS OR BEING SCRUTINIZED IN A WAY THAT WAS NOT SIMILAR TO THE MEN AROUND THEM TO THEIR MALE COUNTERPARTS
YOU1000000045_S0000166	HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND TO A TRUMP SUPPORTER IF THEY TOOK THE TIME TO LISTEN TO YOU AND SAID
YOU1000000045_S0000167	HILLARY I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR THAT TRUMP IS GOING TO BE IMPEACHED FOR GETTING INFORMATION FROM UKRAINE
YOU1000000045_S0000168	WHEN YOUR TEAM ENGAGED IN RUSSIAN INFORMATION THROUGH YOU KNOW THE CODE TEAM THAT WORKED ON THAT SIDE ON THE STEELE DOSSIER
YOU1000000045_S0000169	HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT PERSON WHEN THEY SAY YOU ENGAGED IN FOREIGN INFORMATION ON A POLITICAL RIVAL TRUMP DID THE SAME WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE
YOU1000000045_S0000170	THERE'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT THE POWER THAT THE PRESIDENT HOLDS
YOU1000000045_S0000171	THE PRESIDENT IS IN A POSITION TO USE AMERICAN LEVERAGE AND CREDIBILITY TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS OF OUR NATION
YOU1000000045_S0000172	SO I COULD IMAGINE I COULD IMAGINE A CONVERSATION WHERE A PRESIDENT WOULD SAY TO THE PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE
YOU1000000045_S0000173	YOU'RE NEW AT THE JOB ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS HELD YOU BACK IS CORRUPTION WE WANT TO HELP YOU FIGHT CORRUPTION
YOU1000000045_S0000174	WE WANT EVIDENCE THAT YOU ARE REALLY DEDICATED TO FIGHTING CORRUPTION RIGHT IF THAT'S ALL THAT HAD BEEN SAID
YOU1000000045_S0000175	THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH
YOU1000000045_S0000176	SECRETARY OF STATE I USED TO GO AND VISIT LEADERS AND SAY YOU KNOW ONE OF YOUR BIGGEST PROBLEMS IS YOU'VE GOT RAMPANT CORRUPTION
YOU1000000045_S0000177	IT'S IN YOUR FAMILY IT'S IN YOUR PEOPLE AROUND YOU YOU'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH IT
YOU1000000045_S0000178	BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED AND WE NOW HAVE NOT ONLY THE WHISTLEBLOWER AND THE ALLEGED INCOMPLETE TRANSCRIPT
YOU1000000045_S0000179	NOW HAVE A LOT OF WITNESSES WHO ARE ALL SAYING THIS WAS ABOUT HELPING THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF
YOU1000000045_S0000180	HE IS ACTING AS THE PRESIDENT HE'S NOT A POLITICAL CANDIDATE HE IS NOT A PRIVATE CITIZEN HE'S THE PRESIDENT
YOU1000000045_S0000181	WORKS FOR THE UNITED STATES
YOU1000000045_S0000182	WORK IN THE UNITED STATES AND WE DON'T WANT TO SQUANDER OUR CREDIBILITY
YOU1000000045_S0000183	SO IF OTHER COUNTRIES SEE THIS AS THEY CLEARLY ARE
YOU1000000045_S0000184	THIS PRESIDENT REALLY COULD CARE LESS ABOUT UKRAINE COULD CARE LESS WHETHER IT BECOMES A STABLE COUNTRY COULD CARE LESS WHETHER IT'S ABLE TO DEFEND ITSELF AGAINST RUSSIA
YOU1000000045_S0000185	ALL HE WANTS IS FOR THEM TO MANUFACTURE SOME KIND OF DAMAGING INFORMATION
YOU1000000045_S0000186	ABOUT THE PERSON HE THINKS IS HIS LIKELY OPPONENT JOE BIDEN
YOU1000000045_S0000187	SO THERE'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE I MEAN PEOPLE CAN GATHER YOU KNOW INFORMATION IN YOU KNOW ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT WAYS
YOU1000000045_S0000188	BUT WHEN YOU COMBINE IT WITH THAT QUID PRO QUO THAT EXISTED IN THAT CONVERSATION WHICH HAS NOW BEEN VERIFIED REPEATEDLY
YOU1000000045_S0000189	PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE ROOM PEOPLE WHO WERE UNDER PRESSURE
YOU1000000045_S0000190	TO DEPRIVE THE UKRAINIANS OF MILITARY AID SO THEY COULD DEFEND THEMSELVES THERE'S AN ACTIVE WAR GOING ON IN EASTERN UKRAINE
YOU1000000045_S0000191	THE RUSSIANS AND THEIR PROXIES ARE STILL KILLING UKRAINIANS AND SO
YOU1000000045_S0000192	WHAT THIS PRESIDENT HAS BASICALLY DONE IS SAY I DON'T CARE I DON'T CARE ABOUT ANY OF THAT I JUST NEED SOME DIRT
YOU1000000045_S0000193	AND I DON'T CARE IF YOU MAKE IT UP YOU KNOW IN ORDER TO GET MILITARY AID YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE ME SOMETHING ON JOE BIDEN AND HIS
YOU1000000045_S0000194	IT REALLY DOES SEEM LIKE TRUMP HAS TAKEN AN UNCONVENTIONAL APPROACH TO SAY THE LEAST IN INTERNATIONAL
YOU1000000045_S0000195	HE'S BEEN VERY EXPLICIT IN SAYING IT'S AMERICA FIRST AND THAT'S ALL I CARE ABOUT SYRIA HAS BEEN AN INTERESTING CASE
YOU1000000045_S0000196	AND AS A FORMER SECRETARY YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO SPEAK TO THIS WITH AN IN DEPTH KNOWLEDGE
YOU1000000045_S0000197	TRUMP SAID I PULLED THE TROOPS OUT BECAUSE IT'S TIME FOR AMERICA TO LEAVE THESE ENDLESS WARS EVERYONE SPOKE OUT AGAINST TRUMP FOR DOING THIS
YOU1000000045_S0000198	BUT IT WAS ONE OF YOUR FORMER AMBASSADORS ROBERT FORD WHO SAID AT ONE POINT THAT THE ALLIANCE WITH THE KURDS WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE PERMANENT
YOU1000000045_S0000199	IT WAS JUST MEANT TO BE A TEMPORARY COMING TOGETHER BECAUSE BOTH SIDES WANTED TO BEAT ISIS AND THEY WEREN'T ALLIES OF ALL TIME WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE MORE CORRECT APPROACH THEN
YOU1000000045_S0000200	LOOK I DON'T THINK HIS REAL PHILOSOPHY IS AMERICA FIRST I THINK IT'S TRUMP FIRST AND HE JUDGES EVERYTHING AS TO HOW IT WILL HELP HIM
YOU1000000045_S0000201	AND PERHAPS HE IMPULSIVELY DECIDED THAT BRINGING OUR TROOPS HOME WAS GOOD FOR HIM POLITICALLY
YOU1000000045_S0000202	AND THAT SEEMS TO BE HOW HE IS JUSTIFYING IT
YOU1000000045_S0000203	BUT LET'S ASSUME WE HAD A PRESIDENT WHO WAS INTERESTED IN ACHIEVING THAT GOAL IN A DEFENSIBLE WAY
YOU1000000045_S0000204	HERE'S WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED HE COULD HAVE VERY WELL HAVE SAID TO THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT SYRIA THE KURDS THE TURKS AND OTHERS
YOU1000000045_S0000205	SAID YOU KNOW WE NEED TO START A PROCESS IN ORDER TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN PROTECT THE KURDS WHO HAVE BEEN OUR ALLIES
YOU1000000045_S0000206	MAYBE NOT FOR ALL TIME
YOU1000000045_S0000207	THEY SURE HAVE BEEN SACRIFICING ON BEHALF OF OUR OBJECTIVE TO DRIVE THE ISLAMIC STATE OUT OF SYRIA
YOU1000000045_S0000208	AND WE KNOW THEY'RE HOLDING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PRISONERS FOR US SO LET'S NOT LEAVE THEM TO THEIR FATE
YOU1000000045_S0000209	LET'S FIGURE OUT HOW WE WORK WITH THE TURKS WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR BORDER LET'S SEE HOW WE WORK WITH THE KURDS LET'S USE THE LEVERAGE WE HAVE
YOU1000000045_S0000210	BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE TROOPS THAT ARE SPECIAL FORCES WHO ARE WORKING ALONGSIDE THE KURDS AND LET'S FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN
YOU1000000045_S0000211	INSTEAD OF JUST WAKING UP AND WALKING TO THE SOUTH LAWN OF THE WHITE HOUSE AND SAYING WE'RE BRINGING ALL OUR TROOPS HOME AND I'VE TALKED TO PRESIDENT ERDOGAN
YOU1000000045_S0000212	AND SINCE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HE SAYS ON THESE CALLS FOR ALL WE KNOW IT COULD BE HEY YOU KNOW PRESIDENT ERDOGAN WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR TROOPS OUT WHAT DO YOU HAVE ON JOE BIDEN
YOU1000000045_S0000213	WE DON'T KNOW
YOU1000000045_S0000214	
YOU1000000045_S0000215	AND THAT'S WHAT'S SO FRIGHTENING ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING
YOU1000000045_S0000216	BECAUSE HE HAS AN AFFINITY FOR DICTATORS HE'S CLEARLY MISJUDGED THE NORTH KOREANS
YOU1000000045_S0000217	KIM JONG UN HAS BEEN FIRING MISSILES AND OBVIOUSLY NOT BEHAVING THE WAY THAT A MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE LED HIM TO
YOU1000000045_S0000218	HE CLEARLY DOES PUTIN'S BIDDING I MEAN PUTIN COULD NOT BE HAPPIER TO HAVE THE UKRAINIANS CAUGHT UP IN THIS
YOU1000000045_S0000219	WHILE HE CONTINUES TO YOU KNOW EAT AWAY AT THEIR COUNTRY AND THEIR SOVEREIGNTY
YOU1000000045_S0000220	THE RUSSIANS HAVE A HUGE AMOUNT OF INFLUENCE NOW IN THE MIDDLE EAST
YOU1000000045_S0000221	BECAUSE THEY'RE RIGHT THERE IN SYRIA ALONGSIDE THE IRANIANS AND PROPPING UP THE ASSAD GOVERNMENT
YOU1000000045_S0000222	SO THERE'S A LOT OF MOVING PIECES ON THIS COMPLEX CHESSBOARD
YOU1000000045_S0000223	AND I'VE BEEN IN A WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM WHERE THE PRESIDENT WAS DEMANDING INFORMATION
YOU1000000045_S0000224	NOT ACTING ON IMPULSE WHERE WE WERE RUNNING THROUGH DIFFERENT SCENARIOS WHERE WE HAD TO BE CONSTANTLY TESTING OUR OPINIONS AGAINST OTHERS
YOU1000000045_S0000225	IN ORDER TO GIVE THE PRESIDENT THE BEST ADVICE THAT IS NOT HAPPENING IN THIS WHITE HOUSE
YOU1000000045_S0000226	IT IS UNFORTUNATELY UNPREDICTABLE ABOUT WHAT HE WILL DO NEXT
YOU1000000045_S0000227	SO THEREFORE OTHER COUNTRIES PARTICULARLY ONES ADVERSARIAL TO US
YOU1000000045_S0000228	ARE GOING AROUND THE WORLD SAYING YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T COUNT ON AMERICA ANYMORE RIGHT YOU KNOW COUNT ON US
YOU1000000045_S0000229	WILL SELL YOU ARMS NOT THE AMERICANS WILL MAKE DEALS WITH YOU NOT THE AMERICANS WILL HAVE INVESTMENTS IN YOUR COUNTRY NOT THE AMERICANS
YOU1000000045_S0000230	AND IT'S A TRAGEDY
YOU1000000045_S0000231	BECAUSE I THINK WE WERE REALLY WELL POSITIONED AT THE END OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO KEEP BUILDING ON OUR LEADERSHIP
YOU1000000045_S0000232	AND I THINK THAT'S BEEN SQUANDERED UNDER THIS PRESIDENT
YOU1000000045_S0000233	LET ME ASK YOU ONE QUESTION BEFORE WE WRAP IT UP THE BOOK OF GUTSY WOMEN TALKS ABOUT WOMEN WHO HAVE DONE SOMETHING AMAZING THROUGHOUT TIME
YOU1000000045_S0000234	ONE THING THAT WE CAN'T DENY HAS CHANGED THROUGHOUT TIME HAS BEEN POLITICS AND THE WAY WE SEE THE WORLD
YOU1000000045_S0000235	I'VE ALWAYS BEEN FASCINATED AS TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP YOU KNOW YOU ARE YOU ARE YOUR MOTHER'S DAUGHTER YES
YOU1000000045_S0000236	BUT YOU ARE YOUNGER THAN HER ARE THERE EVER POLITICAL IDEAS OR YOU KNOW CONVERSATIONS YOU HAVE WHERE YOU DON'T AGREE OR YOU'VE CHANGED HOW YOU SEE AN IDEA BECAUSE OF YOUR AGE DIFFERENCE
YOU1000000045_S0000237	
YOU1000000045_S0000238	YES ABSOLUTELY I THINK MOST NOTABLY ON GAY MARRIAGE AND EQUAL MARRIAGE RIGHTS

YOU1000000045_S0000243	WERE LIKE IN THE HOUSE AND YOU'RE LIKE MOM GET GAY RIGHTS GOING COME ON I MEAN
YOU1000000045_S0000244	IT'S LIKE A WEIRD FIGHT TO BE HAVING WITH YOUR MOM I'M NOT LIKE I WAS LIKE I WANT TO GO TO A PARTY AND YOU WERE LIKE MOM GAY PEOPLE NEED TO GET
YOU1000000045_S0000245	YOUR ROOM YOUNG LADY THAT'S PRETTY WILD
YOU1000000045_S0000247	I MEAN YES BUT HOPEFULLY IN A NICER TONE
YOU1000000045_S0000248	CHELSEA WAS YOU KNOW REALLY ONE OF THE STRONG VOICES ON BEHALF OF GAY MARRIAGE HERE IN NEW YORK
YOU1000000045_S0000249	SHE YOU KNOW GAVE LOTS OF SPEECHES SHE WAS PART OF A GROUP OF LEADERS THAT WERE ADVOCATING FOR IT
YOU1000000045_S0000250	AND YOU KNOW I REALLY RESPECT AND AND LISTEN TO HER ABOUT ALL KINDS OF THINGS
YOU1000000045_S0000251	AND THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT MADE A LOT OF SENSE TO ME ESPECIALLY BECAUSE SHE HAD SUCH PASSION ABOUT IT
YOU1000000045_S0000252	WELL I'LL TELL YOU THIS IT IS A BOOK OF GUTSY WOMEN WRITTEN BY TWO OF THE GATTIS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING ON THE SHOW THE WONDERFUL HAVING YOU HERE
YOU1000000045_S0000253	IS AVAILABLE NOW SECRETARY HILLARY CLINTON AND CHELSEA CLINTON EVERYBODY
YOU1000000101_S0000001	THE FOLLOWING PRE RECORDED POLITICAL PROGRAM IS SPONSORED BY TV FOR GOLDWATER MILLER ON BEHALF OF BARRY GOLDWATER REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
YOU1000000101_S0000002	LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE TAKE PRIDE IN PRESENTING A THOUGHTFUL ADDRESS BY RONALD REAGAN MR REAGAN
YOU1000000101_S0000004	
YOU1000000101_S0000006	THANK YOU VERY MUCH
YOU1000000101_S0000008	THANK YOU AND GOOD EVENING THE SPONSOR HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BUT UNLIKE MOST TELEVISION PROGRAMS THE PERFORMER HASN'T BEEN PROVIDED WITH A SCRIPT
YOU1000000101_S0000009	AS A MATTER OF FACT I HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO CHOOSE MY OWN WORDS AND DISCUSS MY OWN IDEAS REGARDING THE CHOICE THAT WE FACE IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS
YOU1000000101_S0000010	I HAVE SPENT MOST OF MY LIFE AS A DEMOCRAT I RECENTLY HAVE SEEN FIT TO FOLLOW ANOTHER COURSE
YOU1000000101_S0000011	I BELIEVE THAT THE ISSUES CONFRONTING US CROSS PARTY LINES
YOU1000000101_S0000013	NOW ONE SIDE IN THIS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN TELLING US THAT THE ISSUES OF THIS ELECTION ARE THE MAINTENANCE OF PEACE AND PROSPERITY THE LINE HAS BEEN USED WE'VE NEVER HAD IT SO GOOD
YOU1000000101_S0000014	BUT I HAVE AN UNCOMFORTABLE FEELING THAT THIS PROSPERITY ISN'T SOMETHING ON WHICH WE CAN BASE OUR HOPES FOR THE FUTURE
YOU1000000101_S0000015	NO NATION IN HISTORY HAS EVER SURVIVED A TAX BURDEN THAT REACHED A THIRD OF ITS NATIONAL INCOME
YOU1000000101_S0000016	TODAY THIRTY SEVEN CENTS OUT OF EVERY DOLLAR EARNED IN THIS COUNTRY IS THE TAX COLLECTOR SHARE
YOU1000000101_S0000017	AND YET OUR GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO SPEND SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS A DAY MORE THAN THE GOVERNMENT TAKES IN
YOU1000000101_S0000018	WE HAVEN'T BALANCED OUR BUDGET TWENTY EIGHT OUT OF THE LAST THIRTY FOUR YEARS WE'VE RAISED OUR DEBT LIMIT THREE TIMES IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS
YOU1000000101_S0000019	AND NOW OUR NATIONAL DEBT IS ONE AND A HALF TIMES BIGGER THAN ALL THE COMBINED DEBTS OF ALL THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD
YOU1000000101_S0000020	WE HAVE FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN GOLD IN OUR TREASURY WE DON'T OWN AN OUNCE FOREIGN DOLLAR CLAIMS ARE TWENTY SEVEN POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS
YOU1000000101_S0000021	AND WE'VE JUST HAD ANNOUNCED THAT THE DOLLAR OF NINETEEN THIRTY NINE WILL NOW PURCHASE FORTY FIVE CENTS IN ITS TOTAL VALUE
YOU1000000101_S0000022	AS FOR THE PEACE THAT WE WOULD PRESERVE
YOU1000000101_S0000023	I WONDER WHO AMONG US WOULD LIKE TO APPROACH THE WIFE OR MOTHER WHOSE HUSBAND OR SON HAS DIED IN SOUTH VIETNAM AND ASK THEM IF THEY THINK THIS IS A PEACE
YOU1000000101_S0000024	THAT SHOULD BE MAINTAINED INDEFINITELY DO THEY MEAN PEACE OR DO THEY MEAN WE JUST WANT TO BE LEFT IN PEACE
YOU1000000101_S0000025	THERE CAN BE NO REAL PEACE WHILE ONE AMERICAN IS DYING SOMEPLACE IN THE WORLD FOR THE REST OF US
YOU1000000101_S0000026	WE'RE AT WAR WITH THE MOST DANGEROUS ENEMY THAT HAS EVER FACED MANKIND IN HIS LONG CLIMB FROM THE SWAMP TO THE STARS
YOU1000000101_S0000027	AND IT'S BEEN SAID IF WE LOSE THAT WAR AND IN SO DOING LOSE THIS WAY OF FREEDOM OF OURS
YOU1000000101_S0000028	HISTORY WILL RECORD WITH THE GREATEST ASTONISHMENT THAT THOSE WHO HAD THE MOST TO LOSE DID THE LEAST TO PREVENT IT HAPPENING
YOU1000000101_S0000029	WELL I THINK IT'S TIME WE ASK OURSELVES IF WE STILL KNOW THE FREEDOMS THAT WERE INTENDED FOR US BY THE FOUNDING FATHERS
YOU1000000101_S0000030	NOT TOO LONG AGO TWO FRIENDS OF MINE WERE TALKING TO A CUBAN REFUGEE A BUSINESSMAN WHO HAD ESCAPED FROM CASTRO
YOU1000000101_S0000031	AND IN THE MIDST OF HIS STORY ONE OF MY FRIENDS TURNED TO THE OTHER AND SAID WE DON'T KNOW HOW LUCKY WE ARE AND THE CUBAN STOPPED AND SAID HOW LUCKY YOU ARE
YOU1000000101_S0000032	I HAD SOME PLACE TO ESCAPE TO AND IN THAT SENTENCE HE TOLD US THE ENTIRE STORY
YOU1000000101_S0000033	IF WE LOSE FREEDOM HERE THERE'S NO PLACE TO ESCAPE TO THIS IS THE LAST STAND ON EARTH
YOU1000000101_S0000034	AND THIS IDEA THAT GOVERNMENT IS BEHOLDEN TO THE PEOPLE THAT IT HAS NO OTHER SOURCE OF POWER EXCEPT THE SOVEREIGN PEOPLE
YOU1000000101_S0000035	IT'S STILL THE NEWEST AND THE MOST UNIQUE IDEA IN ALL THE LONG HISTORY OF MAN'S RELATION TO MAN
YOU1000000101_S0000036	THIS IS THE ISSUE OF THIS ELECTION
YOU1000000101_S0000037	WHETHER WE BELIEVE IN OUR CAPACITY FOR SELF GOVERNMENT OR WHETHER WE ABANDON THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION
YOU1000000101_S0000038	AND CONFESS THAT A LITTLE INTELLECTUAL ELITE IN A FAR DISTANT CAPITAL CAN PLAN OUR LIVES FOR US BETTER THAN WE CAN PLAN THEM OURSELVES
YOU1000000101_S0000039	YOU AND I ARE TOLD INCREASINGLY WE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN A LEFT OR RIGHT WELL I'D LIKE TO SUGGEST THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A LEFT OR RIGHT
YOU1000000101_S0000040	THERE'S ONLY AN UP OR DOWN
YOU1000000101_S0000042	MAN'S OLD OLD AGE DREAM THE ULTIMATE IN INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM CONSISTENT WITH LAW AND ORDER OR DOWN TO THE ANT HEAP OF TOTALITARIANISM
YOU1000000101_S0000043	AND REGARDLESS OF THEIR SINCERITY THEIR HUMANITARIAN MOTIVES THOSE WHO WOULD TRADE OUR FREEDOM FOR SECURITY HAVE EMBARKED ON THIS DOWNWARD COURSE
YOU1000000101_S0000044	IN THIS VOTE HARVESTING TIME THEY USE TERMS LIKE THE GREAT SOCIETY
YOU1000000101_S0000045	OR AS WE WERE TOLD A FEW DAYS AGO BY THE PRESIDENT WE MUST ACCEPT A GREATER GOVERNMENT ACTIVITY IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE PEOPLE
YOU1000000101_S0000046	BUT THEY'VE BEEN A LITTLE MORE EXPLICIT IN THE PAST AND AMONG THEMSELVES AND ALL OF THE THINGS I NOW WILL QUOTE HAVE APPEARED IN PRINT
YOU1000000101_S0000047	THESE ARE NOT REPUBLICAN ACCUSATIONS
YOU1000000101_S0000048	FOR EXAMPLE THEY HAVE VOICES THAT SAY THE COLD WAR WILL END THROUGH OUR ACCEPTANCE OF A NOT UNDEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM
YOU1000000101_S0000049	ANOTHER VOICE SAYS THE PROFIT MOTIVE HAS BECOME OUTMODED IT MUST BE REPLACED BY THE INCENTIVES OF THE WELFARE STATE
YOU1000000101_S0000050	OR OUR TRADITIONAL SYSTEM OF INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM IS INCAPABLE OF SOLVING THE COMPLEX PROBLEMS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
YOU1000000101_S0000051	SENATOR FULBRIGHT HAS SAID AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY THAT THE CONSTITUTION IS OUTMODED
YOU1000000101_S0000052	HE REFERRED TO THE PRESIDENT AS OUR MORAL TEACHER AND OUR LEADER
YOU1000000101_S0000054	AND HE SAYS HE IS HOBBLED IN HIS TASK BY THE RESTRICTIONS OF POWER IMPOSED ON HIM BY THIS ANTIQUATED DOCUMENT
YOU1000000101_S0000055	HE MUST BE FREE SO THAT HE CAN DO FOR US WHAT HE KNOWS IS BEST
YOU1000000101_S0000056	AND SENATOR CLARK OF PENNSYLVANIA ANOTHER ARTICULATE SPOKESMAN DEFINES LIBERALISM AS MEETING THE MATERIAL NEEDS OF THE MASSES THROUGH THE FULL POWER OF CENTRALIZED GOVERNMENT
YOU1000000101_S0000057	WHILE I FOR ONE RESENT IT WHEN A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PEOPLE REFERS TO YOU AND ME THE FREE MEN AND WOMEN OF THIS COUNTRY AS THE MASSES
YOU1000000101_S0000058	THIS IS A TERM WE HAVEN'T APPLIED TO OURSELVES IN AMERICA
YOU1000000101_S0000059	BUT BEYOND THAT THE FULL POWER OF CENTRALIZED GOVERNMENT THIS WAS THE VERY THING THE FOUNDING FATHERS SOUGHT TO MINIMIZE
YOU1000000101_S0000060	THEY KNEW THAT GOVERNMENTS DON'T CONTROL THINGS A GOVERNMENT CAN'T CONTROL THE ECONOMY WITHOUT CONTROLLING PEOPLE
YOU1000000101_S0000061	AND THEY KNOW WHEN A GOVERNMENT SETS OUT TO DO THAT IT MUST USE FORCE AND COERCION TO ACHIEVE ITS PURPOSE
YOU1000000101_S0000062	THEY ALSO KNEW THOSE FOUNDING FATHERS THAT OUTSIDE OF ITS LEGITIMATE FUNCTIONS GOVERNMENT DOES NOTHING AS WELL OR AS ECONOMICALLY AS THE PRIVATE SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY
YOU1000000101_S0000063	NOW WE HAVE NO BETTER EXAMPLE OF THIS THAN GOVERNMENT'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE FARM ECONOMY OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS
YOU1000000101_S0000064	SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE THE COST OF THIS PROGRAM HAS NEARLY DOUBLED ONE FOURTH OF FARMING IN AMERICA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE FARM SURPLUS
YOU1000000101_S0000065	THREE FOURTHS OF FARMING IS OUT ON THE FREE MARKET AND HAS KNOWN A TWENTY ONE PERCENT INCREASE IN THE PER CAPITA CONSUMPTION OF ALL ITS PRODUCE
YOU1000000101_S0000066	YOU SEE THAT ONE FOURTH OF FARMING THAT'S REGULATED AND CONTROLLED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
YOU1000000101_S0000067	IN THE LAST THREE YEARS WE'VE SPENT FORTY THREE DOLLARS IN THE FEED GRAIN PROGRAM FOR EVERY DOLLAR BUSHEL OF CORN WE DON'T GROW
YOU1000000101_S0000068	SENATOR HUMPHREY LAST WEEK CHARGED THAT BARRY GOLDWATER AS PRESIDENT WOULD SEEK TO ELIMINATE FARMERS HE SHOULD DO HIS HOMEWORK A LITTLE BETTER
YOU1000000101_S0000069	BECAUSE HE'LL FIND OUT THAT WE'VE HAD A DECLINE OF FIVE MILLION IN THE FARM POPULATION UNDER THESE GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS
YOU1000000101_S0000070	HE'LL ALSO FIND THAT THE DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATION HAS SOUGHT TO GET FROM CONGRESS
YOU1000000101_S0000071	EXTENSION OF THE FARM PROGRAM TO INCLUDE THAT THREE FOURTHS THAT IS NOW FREE
YOU1000000101_S0000072	YOU'LL FIND THAT THEY'VE ALSO ASKED FOR THE RIGHT TO IMPRISON FARMERS WHO WOULDN'T KEEP BOOKS AS PRESCRIBED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
YOU1000000101_S0000073	THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE ASKED FOR THE RIGHT TO SEIZE FARMS THROUGH CONDEMNATION AND RESELL THEM TO OTHER INDIVIDUALS
YOU1000000101_S0000074	AND CONTAINED IN THAT SAME PROGRAM WAS A PROVISION THAT WOULD HAVE ALLOWED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO REMOVE TWO MILLION FARMERS FROM THE SOIL
YOU1000000101_S0000075	AT THE SAME TIME THERE'S BEEN AN INCREASE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE EMPLOYEES THERE'S NOW ONE FOR EVERY THIRTY FARMS IN THE UNITED STATES
YOU1000000101_S0000076	AND STILL THEY CAN'T TELL US HOW SIXTY SIX SHIPLOADS OF GRAIN HEADED FOR AUSTRIA DISAPPEARED WITHOUT A TRACE AND BILLY SALLETS NEVER LEFT SHORE
YOU1000000101_S0000078	EVERY RESPONSIBLE FARMER AND FARM ORGANIZATION HAS REPEATEDLY ASKED THE GOVERNMENT TO FREE THE FARM ECONOMY
YOU1000000101_S0000079	BUT HOW WHO ARE FARMERS TO KNOW WHAT'S BEST FOR THEM
YOU1000000101_S0000080	THE WHEAT FARMERS VOTED AGAINST A WHEAT PROGRAM THE GOVERNMENT PASSED IT ANYWAY NOW THE PRICE OF BREAD GOES UP THE PRICE OF WHEAT TO THE FARMER GOES DOWN
YOU1000000101_S0000081	MEANWHILE BACK IN THE CITY UNDER URBAN RENEWAL THE ASSAULT ON FREEDOM CARRIES ON
YOU1000000101_S0000083	PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS SO DELUDED THAT PUBLIC INTEREST IS ALMOST ANYTHING A FEW GOVERNMENT PLANNERS DECIDE IT SHOULD BE IN A PROGRAM THAT TAKES FROM THE NEEDY AND GIVES TO THE GREEDY
YOU1000000101_S0000084	WE SEE SUCH SPECTACLES AS IN CLEVELAND OHIO A MILLION AND A HALF DOLLARS BUILDING COMPLETED ONLY THREE YEARS AGO MUST BE DESTROYED
YOU1000000101_S0000085	TO MAKE WAY FOR WHAT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS CALL A MORE COMPATIBLE USE OF THE LAND
YOU1000000101_S0000086	THE PRESIDENT TELLS US HE'S NOW GOING TO START BUILDING PUBLIC HOUSING UNITS IN THE THOUSANDS WERE HERETOFORE WE'VE ONLY BUILT THEM IN THE HUNDREDS
YOU1000000101_S0000087	BUT FHA AND THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION TELL US THEY HAVE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND HOUSING UNITS THEY'VE TAKEN BACK THROUGH MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE
YOU1000000101_S0000088	FOR THREE DECADES WE'VE SOUGHT TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF UNEMPLOYMENT THROUGH GOVERNMENT PLANNING AND THE MORE THE PLANS FAIL THE MORE THE PLANNERS PLAN
YOU1000000101_S0000089	THE LATEST IS THE AREA REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY
YOU1000000101_S0000090	THEY'VE JUST DECLARED RICE COUNTY KANSAS A DEPRESSED AREA
YOU1000000101_S0000091	RICE COUNTY KANSAS HAS TWO HUNDRED OIL WELLS AND THE FOURTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE THERE HAVE OVER THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ON DEPOSIT IN PERSONAL SAVINGS IN THEIR BANKS
YOU1000000101_S0000093	WHEN THE GOVERNMENT TELLS YOU YOU'RE DEPRESSED LIE DOWN AND BE DEPRESSED
YOU1000000101_S0000094	WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO CAN'T SEE A FAT MAN STANDING BESIDE A THIN ONE WITHOUT COMING TO THE CONCLUSION THE FAT MAN GOT THAT WAY BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE THIN ONE
YOU1000000101_S0000095	SO THEY'RE GOING TO SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS OF HUMAN MISERY THROUGH GOVERNMENT AND GOVERNMENT PLANNING
YOU1000000101_S0000096	WELL NOW IF GOVERNMENT PLANNING AND WELFARE HAD THE ANSWER
YOU1000000101_S0000097	AND THEY'VE HAD ALMOST THIRTY YEARS OF IT SHOULDN'T WE EXPECT GOVERNMENT TO READ THE SCORE TO US ONCE IN A WHILE
YOU1000000101_S0000098	SHOULDN'T THEY BE TELLING US ABOUT THE DECLINE EACH YEAR IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE NEEDING HELP
YOU1000000101_S0000099	THE REDUCTION IN THE NEED FOR PUBLIC HOUSING BUT THE REVERSE IS TRUE EACH YEAR THE NEED GROWS GREATER THE PROGRAM GROWS GREATER
YOU1000000101_S0000101	WE WERE TOLD FOUR YEARS AGO THAT SEVENTEEN MILLION PEOPLE WENT TO BED HUNGRY EACH NIGHT WELL THAT WAS PROBABLY TRUE THEY WERE ALL ON A DIET
YOU1000000101_S0000104	BUT NOW WE'RE TOLD THAT NINE POINT THREE MILLION FAMILIES IN THIS COUNTRY ARE POVERTY STRICKEN ON THE BASIS OF EARNING LESS THAN THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR
YOU1000000101_S0000105	WELFARE SPENDING TEN TIMES GREATER THAN IT WAS IN THE DARK DEPTHS OF THE DEPRESSION
YOU1000000101_S0000106	WE'RE SPENDING FORTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS ON WELFARE
YOU1000000101_S0000107	NOW DO A LITTLE ARITHMETIC AND YOU'LL FIND THAT IF WE DIVIDED THE FORTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS UP EQUALLY AMONG THOSE NINE MILLION POOR FAMILIES
YOU1000000101_S0000108	WE'D BE ABLE TO GIVE EACH FAMILY FORTY SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR AND THIS ADDED TO THEIR PRESENT INCOME SHOULD ELIMINATE POVERTY
YOU1000000101_S0000110	DIRECT AID TO THE POOR HOWEVER IS ONLY RUNNING ABOUT SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS PER FAMILY IT WOULD SEEM THAT SOME PLACE THERE MUST BE SOME OVERHEAD
YOU1000000101_S0000112	
YOU1000000101_S0000114	NOW WE DECLARE WAR ON POVERTY OR YOU TOO CAN BE A BOBBY BAKER
YOU1000000101_S0000116	DO THEY HONESTLY EXPECT US TO BELIEVE THAT IF WE ADD ONE BILLION DOLLARS TO THE FORTY FIVE BILLION WE'RE SPENDING ONE MORE PROGRAM TO THE THIRTY ODD WE HAVE
YOU1000000101_S0000117	AND REMEMBER THIS NEW PROGRAM DOESN'T REPLACE ANY IT JUST DUPLICATES EXISTING PROGRAMS DO THEY BELIEVE THAT POVERTY IS SUDDENLY GOING TO DISAPPEAR BY MAGIC
YOU1000000101_S0000118	WELL IN ALL FAIRNESS I SHOULD EXPLAIN THERE IS ONE PART OF THE NEW PROGRAM THAT ISN'T DUPLICATED THIS IS THE YOUTH FEATURE WE'RE NOW GOING TO SOLVE THE DROPOUT PROBLEM JUVENILE DELINQUENCY
YOU1000000101_S0000119	BY REINSTITUTING SOMETHING LIKE THE OLD CCC CAMPS AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE IN THESE CAMPS
YOU1000000101_S0000120	BUT AGAIN WE DO SOME ARITHMETIC AND WE FIND THAT WE'RE GOING TO SPEND EACH YEAR JUST ON ROOM AND BOARD FOR EACH YOUNG PERSON WE HELP FORTY SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR
YOU1000000101_S0000121	WE CAN SEND THEM TO HARVARD FOR TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED
YOU1000000101_S0000123	COURSE DON'T GET ME WRONG I'M NOT SUGGESTING HARVARD IS THE ANSWER TO JUVENILE DELINQUENCY
YOU1000000101_S0000125	SERIOUSLY WHAT ARE WE DOING TO THOSE WE SEEK TO HELP
YOU1000000101_S0000127	NOT TOO LONG AGO A JUDGE CALLED ME HERE IN LOS ANGELES
YOU1000000101_S0000128	HE TOLD ME OF A YOUNG WOMAN WHO'D COME BEFORE HIM FOR A DIVORCE
YOU1000000101_S0000129	SHE HAD SIX CHILDREN WAS PREGNANT WITH HER SEVEN UNDER HIS QUESTIONING SHE REVEALED HER HUSBAND WAS A LABOURER EARNING TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS A MONTH
YOU1000000101_S0000130	SHE WANTED THE DIVORCE TO GET AN EIGHTY DOLLARS RAISE SHE'S ELIGIBLE FOR THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY DOLLARS A MONTH IN THE AID DEPENDENT CHILDREN PROGRAM
YOU1000000101_S0000131	SHE GOT THE IDEA FROM TWO WOMEN IN HER NEIGHBORHOOD WHO HAD ALREADY DONE THAT VERY THING
YOU1000000101_S0000132	YET ANY TIME YOU AND I QUESTION THE SCHEMES OF THE DO GOODERS WERE DENOUNCED AS BEING AGAINST THEIR HUMANITARIAN GOALS THEY SAY WE'RE ALWAYS AGAINST THINGS WE'RE NEVER FOR ANYTHING
YOU1000000101_S0000133	WELL THE TROUBLE WITH OUR LIBERAL FRIENDS IS NOT THAT THEY'RE IGNORANT IT'S JUST THAT THEY KNOW SO MUCH THAT ISN'T SO NOW
YOU1000000101_S0000135	WE'RE FOR A PROVISION THAT DESTITUTION SHOULD NOT FOLLOW UNEMPLOYMENT BY REASON OF OLD AGE AND TO THAT END WE HAVE ACCEPTED SOCIAL SECURITY AS A STEP TOWARD MEETING THE PROBLEM
YOU1000000101_S0000136	BUT WE'RE AGAINST THOSE ENTRUSTED WITH THIS PROGRAM WHEN THEY PRACTICE DECEPTION REGARDING ITS FISCAL SHORTCOMINGS
YOU1000000101_S0000137	WHEN THEY CHARGE THAT ANY CRITICISM OF THE PROGRAM MEANS THAT WE WANT TO END PAYMENTS TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO DEPEND ON THEM FOR A LIVELIHOOD
YOU1000000101_S0000138	THEY'VE CALLED IT INSURANCE TO US IN A HUNDRED MILLION PIECES OF LITERATURE BUT THEN THEY APPEARED BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT AND THEY TESTIFIED IT WAS A WELFARE PROGRAM
YOU1000000101_S0000139	THEY ONLY USE THE TERM INSURANCE TO SELL IT TO THE PEOPLE AND THEY SAID SOCIAL SECURITY DUES ARE A TAX FOR THE GENERAL USE OF THE GOVERNMENT
YOU1000000101_S0000140	AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS USED THAT TAX THERE IS NO FUND BECAUSE ROBERT BYERS THE ACTUARIAL HEAD APPEARED BEFORE A CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE
YOU1000000101_S0000141	AND ADMITTED THAT SOCIAL SECURITY AS OF THIS MOMENT IS TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN THE HOLE
YOU1000000101_S0000142	BUT HE SAID THERE SHOULD BE NO CAUSE FOR WORRY BECAUSE AS LONG AS THEY HAD THE POWER TO TAX THEY COULD ALWAYS TAKE AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE WHATEVER THEY NEEDED TO BAIL THEM OUT OF TROUBLE
YOU1000000101_S0000143	AND THEY'RE DOING JUST THAT A YOUNG MAN TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE WORKING AT AN AVERAGE SALARY
YOU1000000101_S0000144	HIS SOCIAL SECURITY CONTRIBUTION WOULD IN THE OPEN MARKET BUY HIM AN INSURANCE POLICY THAT WOULD GUARANTEE TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS A MONTH
YOU1000000101_S0000145	AT AGE SIXTY FIVE THE GOVERNMENT PROMISES A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN HE COULD LIVE IT UP UNTIL HE'S THIRTY ONE AND THEN TAKE OUT A POLICY THAT WOULD PAY MORE THAN SOCIAL SECURITY
YOU1000000101_S0000146	NOW ARE WE SO LACKING IN BUSINESS SENSE THAT WE CAN'T PUT THIS PROGRAM ON A SOUND BASIS
YOU1000000101_S0000147	SO THAT PEOPLE WHO DO REQUIRE THOSE PAYMENTS WILL FIND THEY CAN GET THEM WHEN THEY'RE DUE THAT THE CUPBOARD ISN'T BARE BARRY GOLDWATER THINKS WE CAN
YOU1000000101_S0000148	AT THE SAME TIME CAN'T WE INTRODUCE VOLUNTARY FEATURES THAT WOULD PERMIT A CITIZEN WHO COULD DO BETTER ON HIS OWN
YOU1000000101_S0000149	TO BE EXCUSED UPON PRESENTATION OF EVIDENCE THAT HE HAD MADE PROVISION FOR THE NON EARNING YEARS
YOU1000000101_S0000150	SHOULD WE NOT ALLOW A WIDOW WITH CHILDREN TO WORK AND NOT LOSE THE BENEFITS SUPPOSEDLY PAID FOR BY HER DECEASED HUSBAND
YOU1000000101_S0000151	SHOULDN'T YOU AND I BE ALLOWED TO DECLARE WHO OUR BENEFICIARIES WILL BE UNDER THIS PROGRAM WHICH WE CANNOT DO
YOU1000000101_S0000152	I THINK WE'RE FORETELLING OUR SENIOR CITIZENS THAT NO ONE IN THIS COUNTRY SHOULD BE DENIED MEDICAL CARE BECAUSE OF A LACK OF FUNDS
YOU1000000101_S0000154	BUT I THINK WE'RE AGAINST FORCING ALL CITIZENS REGARDLESS OF NEED INTO A COMPULSORY GOVERNMENT PROGRAM
YOU1000000101_S0000155	ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE SUCH EXAMPLES AS WAS ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK WHEN FRANCE ADMITTED THAT THEIR MEDICARE PROGRAM IS NOW BANKRUPT THEY'VE COME TO THE END OF THE ROAD
YOU1000000101_S0000156	IN ADDITION WAS BARRY GOLDWATER SO IRRESPONSIBLE WHEN HE SUGGESTED THAT OUR GOVERNMENT GIVE UP ITS PROGRAM OF DELIBERATE PLANNED INFLATION
YOU1000000101_S0000157	SO THAT WHEN YOU DO GET YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY PENSION A DOLLAR WILL BUY A DOLLAR'S WORTH AND NOT FORTY FIVE CENTS WORTH
YOU1000000101_S0000159	I THINK WE'RE FOR AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION WHERE THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD CAN SEEK PEACE
YOU1000000101_S0000160	BUT I THINK WE'RE AGAINST SUBORDINATING AMERICAN INTERESTS TO AN ORGANIZATION THAT HAS BECOME SO STRUCTURALLY UNSOUND
YOU1000000101_S0000161	THAT TODAY YOU CAN MUSTER A TWO THIRDS VOTE ON THE FLOOR OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY AMONG NATIONS THAT REPRESENT LESS THAN TEN PERCENT OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION
YOU1000000101_S0000162	I THINK WE'RE AGAINST THE HYPOCRISY OF ASSAILING OUR ALLIES BECAUSE HERE AND THERE THEY CLING TO A COLONY
YOU1000000101_S0000163	WHILE WE ENGAGE IN A CONSPIRACY OF SILENCE AND NEVER OPEN OUR MOUTHS ABOUT THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ENSLAVED IN THE SOVIET COLONIES IN THE SATELLITE NATIONS
YOU1000000101_S0000165	I THINK WE'RE FOR AIDING OUR ALLIES BY SHARING OF OUR MATERIAL BLESSINGS WITH THOSE NATIONS WHICH SHARE IN OUR FUNDAMENTAL BELIEFS
YOU1000000101_S0000166	BUT WE'RE AGAINST DOLING OUT MONEY GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT CREATING BUREAUCRACY IF NOT SOCIALISM ALL OVER THE WORLD
YOU1000000101_S0000167	WE SET OUT TO HELP NINETEEN COUNTRIES WE'RE HELPING A HUNDRED AND SEVEN WE SPENT A HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS
YOU1000000101_S0000168	WITH THAT MONEY WE BOUGHT A TWO MILLION DOLLAR YACHT FOR HILLAS WE BOUGHT DRESS SUITS FOR GREEK UNDERTAKERS EXTRA WIVES FOR KENYA GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS
YOU1000000101_S0000169	WE BOUGHT A THOUSAND TV SETS FOR A PLACE WHERE THEY HAVE NO ELECTRICITY
YOU1000000101_S0000171	IN THE LAST SIX YEARS FIFTY TWO NATIONS HAVE BOUGHT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF OUR GOLD AND ALL FIFTY TWO ARE RECEIVING FOREIGN AID FROM THIS COUNTRY
YOU1000000101_S0000173	NO GOVERNMENT EVER VOLUNTARILY REDUCES ITSELF IN SIZE SO GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS ONCE LAUNCHED NEVER DISAPPEAR
YOU1000000101_S0000174	ACTUALLY A GOVERNMENT BUREAU IS THE NEAREST THING TO ETERNAL LIFE WE'LL EVER SEE ON THIS EARTH
YOU1000000101_S0000176	FEDERAL EMPLOYEES FEDERAL EMPLOYEES NUMBER TWO AND A HALF MILLION AND FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL ONE OUT OF SIX OF THE NATION'S WORKFORCE EMPLOYED BY GOVERNMENT
YOU1000000101_S0000177	THESE PROLIFERATING BUREAUS WITH THEIR THOUSANDS OF REGULATIONS HAVE COST US MANY OF OUR CONSTITUTIONAL SAFEGUARDS
YOU1000000101_S0000178	HOW MANY OF US REALIZE THAT TODAY FEDERAL AGENTS CAN INVADE A MAN'S PROPERTY WITHOUT A WARRANT THEY CAN IMPOSE A FINE WITHOUT A FORMAL HEARING LET ALONE A TRIAL BY JURY
YOU1000000101_S0000179	AND THEY CAN SEIZE AND SELL HIS PROPERTY AT AUCTION TO ENFORCE THE PAYMENT OF THAT FINE
YOU1000000101_S0000180	IN CHICO COUNTY ARKANSAS JAMES WERE OVERPLANTED HIS RICE ALLOTMENT THE GOVERNMENT OBTAINED A SEVENTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS JUDGMENT
YOU1000000101_S0000181	AND A U S MARSHAL SOLD HIS NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ACRE FARM AT AUCTION THE GOVERNMENT SAID IT WAS NECESSARY AS A WARNING TO OTHERS TO MAKE THE SYSTEM WORK
YOU1000000101_S0000183	LAST FEBRUARY NINETEENTH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA NORMAN THOMAS SIX TIMES CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT ON THE SOCIALIST PARTY TICKET SAID IF BARRY GOLDWATER BECAME PRESIDENT
YOU1000000101_S0000184	HE WOULD STOP THE ADVANCE OF SOCIALISM IN THE UNITED STATES I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE WILL DO
YOU1000000101_S0000186	BUT AS A FORMER DEMOCRAT I CAN TELL YOU NORMAN THOMAS ISN'T THE ONLY MAN WHO HAS DRAWN THIS PARALLEL TO SOCIALISM WITH THE PRESENT ADMINISTRATION
YOU1000000101_S0000187	BECAUSE BACK IN NINETEEN THIRTY SIX MR DEMOCRAT HIMSELF AL SMITH A GREAT AMERICAN CAME BEFORE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
YOU1000000101_S0000188	AND CHARGED THAT THE LEADERSHIP OF HIS PARTY WAS TAKING THE PARTY OF JEFFERSON JACKSON AND CLEVELAND DOWN THE ROAD UNDER THE BANNERS OF MARX LENIN AND STALIN
YOU1000000101_S0000189	AND HE WALKED AWAY FROM HIS PARTY AND HE NEVER RETURNED TILL THE DAY HE DIED
YOU1000000101_S0000190	BECAUSE TO THIS DAY THE LEADERSHIP OF THAT PARTY HAS BEEN TAKING THAT PARTY THAT HONORABLE PARTY DOWN THE ROAD IN THE IMAGE OF THE LABOR SOCIALIST PARTY OF ENGLAND
YOU1000000101_S0000191	NOW IT DOESN'T REQUIRE EXPROPRIATION OR CONFISCATION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY OR BUSINESS TO IMPOSE SOCIALISM ON A PEOPLE
YOU1000000101_S0000192	WHAT DOES IT MEAN WHETHER YOU HOLD THE DEED TO THE OR THE TITLE TO YOUR BUSINESS OR PROPERTY IF THE GOVERNMENT HOLDS THE POWER OF LIFE AND DEATH
YOU1000000101_S0000193	OVER THAT BUSINESS OR PROPERTY AND SUCH MACHINERY ALREADY EXISTS
YOU1000000101_S0000194	THE GOVERNMENT CAN FIND SOME CHARGE TO BRING AGAINST ANY CONCERN IT CHOOSES TO PROSECUTE EVERY BUSINESS MAN HAS HIS OWN TALE OF HARASSMENT
YOU1000000101_S0000195	SOMEWHERE A PERVERSION HAS TAKEN PLACE OUR NATURAL UNALIENABLE RIGHTS ARE NOW CONSIDERED TO BE A DISPENSATION OF GOVERNMENT
YOU1000000101_S0000196	AND FREEDOM HAS NEVER BEEN SO FRAGILE SO CLOSE TO SLIPPING FROM OUR GRASP AS IT IS AT THIS MOMENT
YOU1000000101_S0000197	OUR DEMOCRATIC OPPONENTS SEEM UNWILLING TO DEBATE THESE ISSUES THEY WANT TO MAKE YOU AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A CONTEST BETWEEN TWO MEN
YOU1000000101_S0000198	THAT WERE TO CHOOSE JUST BETWEEN TWO PERSONALITIES WELL WHAT OF THIS MAN THAT THEY WOULD DESTROY
YOU1000000101_S0000199	AND IN DESTROYING THEY WOULD DESTROY THAT WHICH HE REPRESENTS THE IDEAS THAT YOU AND I HOLD DEAR
YOU1000000101_S0000201	IS HE THE RASH AND SHALLOW AND TRIGGER HAPPY MAN THEY SAY HE IS
YOU1000000101_S0000202	WELL I'VE BEEN PRIVILEGED TO KNOW HIM WHEN I KNEW HIM LONG BEFORE HE EVER DREAMED OF TRYING FOR HIGH OFFICE
YOU1000000101_S0000203	AND I CAN TELL YOU PERSONALLY I'VE NEVER KNOWN A MAN IN MY LIFE I BELIEVED SO INCAPABLE OF DOING A DISHONEST OR DISHONORABLE THING
YOU1000000101_S0000205	THIS IS A MAN WHO IN HIS OWN BUSINESS BEFORE HE ENTERED POLITICS INSTITUTED A PROFIT SHARING PLAN BEFORE UNIONS HAD EVER THOUGHT OF IT
YOU1000000101_S0000206	HE PUT IN HEALTH AND MEDICAL INSURANCE FOR ALL HIS EMPLOYEES HE TOOK FIFTY PERCENT OF THE PROFITS BEFORE TAXES
YOU1000000101_S0000207	AND SET UP A RETIREMENT PROGRAM A PENSION PLAN FOR ALL HIS EMPLOYEES
YOU1000000101_S0000208	HE SENT MONTHLY CHECKS FOR LIFE TO AN EMPLOYEE WHO WAS ILL AND COULDN'T WORK HE PROVIDES NURSING CARE FOR THE CHILDREN OF MOTHERS WHO WORK IN THE STORES
YOU1000000101_S0000210	WHEN MEXICO WAS RAVAGED BY THE FLOODS IN THE RIO GRANDE HE CLIMBED IN HIS AIRPLANE AND FLEW FLEW MEDICINE AND SUPPLIES DOWN THERE
YOU1000000101_S0000211	AN TOLD ME HOW HE MET HIM
YOU1000000101_S0000212	IT WAS THE WEEK BEFORE CHRISTMAS DURING THE KOREAN WAR AND HE WAS AT THE LOS ANGELES AIRPORT TRYING TO GET A RIDE HOME TO ARIZONA FOR CHRISTMAS
YOU1000000101_S0000214	AND HE SAID THAT A LOT OF SERVICEMEN THERE AND NO SEATS AVAILABLE ON THE PLANES
YOU1000000101_S0000215	AND THEN A VOICE CAME OVER THE LOUDSPEAKER AND SAID ANY MEN IN UNIFORM WANTING A RIDE TO ARIZONA GO TO RUNWAY SUCH AND SUCH
YOU1000000101_S0000216	AND THEY WENT DOWN THERE THERE WAS A FELLOW NAMED BARRY GOLDWATER SITTING IN HIS PLANE
YOU1000000101_S0000217	EVERY DAY IN THE WEEK BEFORE CHRISTMAS ALL DAY LONG HE'D LOAD UP THE PLANE FLY IT TO ARIZONA FLY THEM TO THEIR HOMES FLY BACK OVER TO GET ANOTHER LOAD
YOU1000000101_S0000219	DURING THE HECTIC SPLIT SECOND TIMING OF A CAMPAIGN THIS IS A MAN WHO TOOK TIME OUT TO SIT BESIDE AN OLD FRIEND WHO WAS DYING OF CANCER
YOU1000000101_S0000220	HIS CAMPAIGN MANAGERS WERE UNDERSTANDABLY IMPATIENT BUT HE SAID THERE AREN'T MANY LEFT WHO CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO HER I'D LIKE HER TO KNOW I CARE
YOU1000000101_S0000221	THIS IS A MAN WHO SAID TO HIS NINETEEN YEAR OLD SON THERE IS NO FOUNDATION LIKE THE ROCK OF HONESTY AND FAIRNESS
YOU1000000101_S0000222	AND WHEN YOU BEGIN TO BUILD YOUR LIFE ON THAT ROCK WITH THE CEMENT OF THE FAITH IN GOD THAT YOU HAVE THEN YOU HAVE A REAL START
YOU1000000101_S0000224	THIS IS NOT A MAN WHO COULD CARELESSLY SEND OTHER PEOPLE'S SONS TO WAR
YOU1000000101_S0000226	THAT IS THE ISSUE OF THIS CAMPAIGN THAT MAKES ALL THE OTHER PROBLEMS I'VE DISCUSSED ACADEMIC UNLESS WE REALIZE WE'RE IN A WAR THAT MUST BE WON
YOU1000000101_S0000228	THOSE WHO WOULD TRADE OUR FREEDOM FOR THE SOUP KITCHEN OF THE WELFARE STATE HAVE TOLD US THEY HAVE A UTOPIAN SOLUTION OF PEACE WITHOUT VICTORY THEY CALL THEIR POLICY ACCOMMODATION
YOU1000000101_S0000229	AND THEY SAY IF WE'LL ONLY AVOID ANY DIRECT CONFRONTATION WITH THE ENEMY HE'LL FORGET HIS EVIL WAYS AND LEARN TO LOVE US
YOU1000000101_S0000230	ALL WHO OPPOSED THEM ARE INDICTED AS WARMONGERS THEY SAY WE OFFER SIMPLE ANSWERS TO COMPLEX PROBLEMS
YOU1000000101_S0000231	WELL PERHAPS THERE IS A SIMPLE ANSWER NOT AN EASY ANSWER BUT SIMPLE IF YOU AND I HAVE THE COURAGE TO TELL OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS
YOU1000000101_S0000232	THAT WE WANT OUR NATIONAL POLICY BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW IN OUR HEARTS IS MORALLY RIGHT WE CANNOT BUY OUR SECURITY OUR FREEDOM FROM THE THREAT OF THE BOMB
YOU1000000101_S0000234	BY COMMITTING AN IMMORALITY SO GREAT AS SAYING TO A BILLION HUMAN BEINGS NOW ENSLAVED BEHIND THE IRON CURTAIN GIVE UP YOUR DREAMS OF FREEDOM
YOU1000000101_S0000235	BECAUSE TO SAVE OUR OWN SKINS WE'RE WILLING TO MAKE A DEAL WITH YOUR SLAVE MASTERS
YOU1000000101_S0000236	ALEXANDER HAMILTON SAID A NATION WHICH CAN PREFER DISGRACE TO DANGER IS PREPARED FOR A MASTER AND DESERVES ONE
YOU1000000101_S0000237	NOW LET'S SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT THERE'S NO ARGUMENT OVER THE CHOICE BETWEEN PEACE AND WAR
YOU1000000101_S0000238	BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE GUARANTEED WAY YOU CAN HAVE PEACE AND YOU CAN HAVE IT IN THE NEXT SECOND SURRENDER
YOU1000000101_S0000239	ADMITTEDLY THERE'S A RISK IN ANY COURSE WE FOLLOW OTHER THAN THIS BUT EVERY LESSON OF HISTORY TELLS US THAT THE GREATER RISK LIES IN APPEASEMENT
YOU1000000101_S0000240	AND THIS IS THE SPECTRE OUR WELL MEANING LIBERAL FRIENDS REFUSE TO FACE THAT THEIR POLICY OF ACCOMMODATION IS APPEASEMENT
YOU1000000101_S0000241	AND IT GIVES NO CHOICE BETWEEN PEACE AND WAR ONLY BETWEEN FIGHT OR SURRENDER
YOU1000000101_S0000242	IF WE CONTINUE TO ACCOMMODATE CONTINUE TO BACK AND RETREAT EVENTUALLY WE HAVE TO FACE THE FINAL DEMAND THE ULTIMATUM AND WHAT THEN
YOU1000000101_S0000243	WHEN NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV HAS TOLD HIS PEOPLE HE KNOWS WHAT OUR ANSWER WILL BE
YOU1000000101_S0000244	HE HAS TOLD THEM THAT WERE RETREATING UNDER THE PRESSURE OF THE COLD WAR AND SOME DAY WHEN THE TIME COMES TO DELIVER THE FINAL ULTIMATUM
YOU1000000101_S0000245	OUR SURRENDER WILL BE VOLUNTARY BECAUSE BY THAT TIME WE WILL HAVE BEEN WEAKENED FROM WITHIN SPIRITUALLY MORALLY AND ECONOMICALLY
YOU1000000101_S0000246	HE BELIEVES THIS BECAUSE FROM OUR SIDE HE'S HEARD VOICES PLEADING FOR PEACE AT ANY PRICE OR BETTER READ THAN DEAD
YOU1000000101_S0000247	OR AS ONE COMMENTATOR PUT IT HE'D RATHER LIVE ON HIS KNEES THAN DIE ON HIS FEET AND THEREIN LIES THE ROAD TO WAR BECAUSE THOSE VOICES DON'T SPEAK FOR THE REST OF US
YOU1000000101_S0000248	YOU AND I KNOW AND DO NOT BELIEVE THAT LIFE IS SO DEAR AND PEACE SO SWEET AS TO BE PURCHASED AT THE PRICE OF CHAINS AND SLAVERY
YOU1000000101_S0000249	IF NOTHING IN LIFE IS WORTH DYING FOR WHEN DID THIS BEGIN JUST IN THE FACE OF THIS ENEMY OR SHOULD MOSES HAVE TOLD THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL TO LIVE IN SLAVERY UNDER THE PHARAOHS
YOU1000000101_S0000251	SHOULD CHRIST HAVE REFUSED THE CROSS SHOULD THE PATRIOTS HAD CONQUERED BRIDGE HAVE THROWN DOWN THEIR GUNS AND REFUSED TO FIRE THE SHOT HEARD ROUND THE WORLD
YOU1000000101_S0000253	THE MARTYRS OF HISTORY WERE NOT FOOLS AND OUR HONORED DEAD WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES TO STOP THE ADVANCE OF THE NAZIS DIDN'T DIE IN VAIN
YOU1000000101_S0000255	WHERE THEN IS THE ROAD TO PEACE WELL IT'S A SIMPLE ANSWER AFTER ALL
YOU1000000101_S0000256	YOU AND I HAVE THE COURAGE TO SAY TO OUR ENEMIES THERE IS A PRICE WE WILL NOT PAY THERE IS A POINT BEYOND WHICH THEY MUST NOT ADVANCE
YOU1000000101_S0000258	THIS
YOU1000000101_S0000260	THIS IS THE MEANING IN THE PHRASE OF BARRY GOLDWATER PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH
YOU1000000101_S0000261	WINSTON CHURCHILL SAID THE DESTINY OF MAN IS NOT MEASURED BY MATERIAL COMPUTATIONS WHEN GREAT FORCES ARE ON THE MOVE IN THE WORLD WE LEARN WE'RE SPIRITS NOT ANIMALS
YOU1000000101_S0000262	AND HE SAID THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON IN TIME AND SPACE AND BEYOND TIME AND SPACE WHICH WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT SPELLS DUTY

YOU1000000102_S0000021	ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND TIMES SLOWER THAN WE DO SO TODAY
YOU1000000102_S0000023	THE APPLE TWO WAS FASTER STILL BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY INTRODUCED COLOR MONITORS INTO THE HOME MARKET
YOU1000000102_S0000024	IN THE MID NINETEEN EIGHTY S THE MACINTOSH BECAME THE FIRST TRULY USER FRIENDLY PERSONAL COMPUTER
YOU1000000102_S0000025	YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO BE AN EXPERT TO SET IT UP OR TO LOAD SOFTWARE
YOU1000000102_S0000026	OR TO TRANSFER INFORMATION BETWEEN APPLICATIONS AND THE MOUSE OFFERED POINT AND CLICK CONVENIENCE
YOU1000000102_S0000027	AND OPENED THE DOOR TO COMPUTER LITERACY FOR EVERYONE
YOU1000000102_S0000028	I STILL REMEMBER THE AMAZED FACES OF ONLOOKERS
YOU1000000102_S0000029	AS THEY SAW A COMPUTER THAT WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM THE PERSONAL COMPUTERS OF THAT DAY

YOU1000000102_S0000036	AND IN MY CASE THE WAY I OFTEN READ BOOKS
YOU1000000102_S0000037	NOW SONGS WE LOVE ARE JUST NINETY NINE CENTS AND A COMPLETELY LEGAL CLICK AWAY
YOU1000000102_S0000039	I PHOTO AND IMOVIE REVOLUTIONIZED THE ABILITY OF CONSUMERS TO ORGANIZE EDIT AND DISPLAY DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY AND VIDEO
YOU1000000102_S0000040	PUTTING CAPABILITIES THAT ONCE COST THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS INTO THE HANDS OF EVERY MAC USER
YOU1000000102_S0000041	STEVE IS ALSO WIDELY RECOGNIZED FOR HIS ABILITY TO CREATE AN INNOVATIVE ENVIRONMENT INSIDE APPLE AS WELL AS AN EXTERNAL COMPANY IMAGE THAT IS EQUALLY INNOVATIVE
YOU1000000102_S0000042	JUST THINK ABOUT APPLE'S MARKETING CAMPAIGNS OVER THE PAST THREE DECADES A PROMOTIONAL FLYER IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX
YOU1000000102_S0000043	SHOWED ISAAC NEWTON SITTING UNDER A TREE JUST AS AN APPLE WAS FALLING BY
YOU1000000102_S0000044	WITH THE CATCHY EXHORTATION TO BITE INTO AN APPLE
YOU1000000102_S0000046	THERE WAS AN ICONIC SUPER BOWL COMMERCIAL
YOU1000000102_S0000048	THE HUMOR
YOU1000000102_S0000050	AN ICONIC SUPERBOWL COMMERCIAL TELLING US THAT THE MACINTOSH WAS ON THE HORIZON
YOU1000000102_S0000051	AND ASSURING US THAT WE WOULD SEE WHY NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR WOULDN'T BE LIKE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR
YOU1000000102_S0000052	AND IN THE LATE NINETEEN NINETY S WE SAW BANNERS AND BILLBOARDS
YOU1000000102_S0000053	FEATURING PABLO PICASSO ALBERT EINSTEIN MARTHA GRAHAM AND MAHATMA GANDHI ALL URGING US TO THINK DIFFERENT
YOU1000000102_S0000055	STEVE JOBS UNDERSTANDS THAT CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION START BY THINKING DIFFERENTLY
YOU1000000102_S0000057	HE HAS A DEEP ROOTED BELIEF IN THE POWER OF EDUCATION TO TRANSFORM LIVES COUPLED WITH A DESIRE TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE
YOU1000000102_S0000059	FROM THE EARLIEST DAYS OF APPLE HE WORKED TO DEVELOP PARTNERSHIPS WITH EDUCATORS AND GET COMPUTERS INTO SCHOOLS
YOU1000000102_S0000061	FOR ALMOST THREE DECADES HE AND HIS COMPANIES HAVE PROVIDED INVALUABLE TECHNOLOGY AND SUPPORT TO SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES
YOU1000000102_S0000062	INCREASING ACCESSIBILITY TO INFORMATION FOR LEARNERS OF ALL AGES
YOU1000000102_S0000064	MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO IN DESCRIBING HIS VISION FOR A NEW UNIVERSITY LELAND STANFORD WROTE
YOU1000000102_S0000065	THE IMAGINATION NEEDS TO BE CULTIVATED AND DEVELOPED TO ASSURE SUCCESS IN LIFE
YOU1000000102_S0000067	STANFORD CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD THAT TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE WAS ONLY THE STARTING POINT FOR CREATION AND DISCOVERY
YOU1000000102_S0000068	STEVE JOBS UNDERSTANDS THAT THE COMPUTER IS A VERY POWERFUL TOOL IN A TECHNICAL SENSE
YOU1000000102_S0000069	BUT THAT ITS TRUE POWER LIES IN THE ABILITY TO UNLEASH THE IMAGINATION AND CREATIVITY OF THE USER
YOU1000000102_S0000071	AS HE EXPLAINED TO THE NEW YORK TIMES IN A NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN INTERVIEW THE MACINTOSH TURNED OUT SO WELL
YOU1000000102_S0000072	BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WORKING ON IT WERE MUSICIANS ARTISTS POETS AND HISTORIANS
YOU1000000102_S0000073	WHO ALSO HAPPENED TO BE EXCELLENT COMPUTER SCIENTISTS
YOU1000000102_S0000075	AND LAST FALL A BUSINESS WEEK REPORTER ASKED HOW HE MANAGES FOR INNOVATION
YOU1000000102_S0000076	HIS ANSWER WAS DECEPTIVELY SIMPLE WE HIRE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO MAKE THE BEST THINGS IN THE WORLD
YOU1000000102_S0000078	STEVE JOBS PERSONIFIES THE SPIRIT AND CREATIVITY THAT HAVE CHARACTERIZED THIS UNIVERSITY SINCE ITS FOUNDING ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN YEARS AGO
YOU1000000102_S0000079	AND WE ARE PLEASED TO HAVE HIM HERE TODAY PLEASE JOIN ME IN WARMLY WELCOMING THIS YEAR'S COMMENCEMENT SPEAKER STEVE JOBS
YOU1000000102_S0000081	I'M HONORED TO BE WITH YOU TODAY FOR YOUR COMMENCEMENT FROM ONE OF THE FINEST UNIVERSITIES IN THE WORLD
YOU1000000102_S0000083	TRUTH BE TOLD
YOU1000000102_S0000085	I NEVER GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE AND THIS IS THE CLOSEST I'VE EVER GOTTEN TO A COLLEGE GRADUATION
YOU1000000102_S0000087	TODAY I WANT TO TELL YOU THREE STORIES FROM MY LIFE THAT'S IT NO BIG DEAL JUST THREE STORIES
YOU1000000102_S0000089	THE FIRST STORY IS ABOUT CONNECTING THE DOTS
YOU1000000102_S0000091	I DROPPED OUT OF REED COLLEGE AFTER THE FIRST SIX MONTHS BUT THEN STAYED AROUND AS A DROP IN FOR ANOTHER EIGHTEEN MONTHS OR SO BEFORE I REALLY QUIT
YOU1000000102_S0000093	SO WHY DO I DROP OUT
YOU1000000102_S0000095	IT STARTED BEFORE I WAS BORN
YOU1000000102_S0000097	MY BIOLOGICAL MOTHER WAS A YOUNG UNWED GRADUATE STUDENT AND SHE DECIDED TO PUT ME UP FOR ADOPTION
YOU1000000102_S0000098	SHE FELT VERY STRONGLY THAT I SHOULD BE ADOPTED BY COLLEGE GRADUATES SO EVERYTHING WAS ALL SET FOR ME TO BE ADOPTED AT BIRTH BY A LAWYER AND HIS WIFE
YOU1000000102_S0000100	EXCEPT THAT WHEN I POPPED OUT THEY DECIDED AT THE LAST MINUTE THAT THEY REALLY WANTED A GIRL
YOU1000000102_S0000102	SO MY PARENTS WHO WERE ON A WAITING LIST GOT A CALL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT ASKING WE'VE GOT AN UNEXPECTED BABY BOY DO YOU WANT HIM
YOU1000000102_S0000103	THEY SAID OF COURSE
YOU1000000102_S0000105	MY BIOLOGICAL MOTHER FOUND OUT LATER THAT MY MOTHER HAD NEVER GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE AND THAT MY FATHER HAD NEVER GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL
YOU1000000102_S0000106	SHE REFUSED TO SIGN THE FINAL ADOPTION PAPERS
YOU1000000102_S0000108	SHE ONLY RELENTED A FEW MONTHS LATER WHEN MY PARENTS PROMISED THAT I WOULD GO TO COLLEGE THIS WAS THE START IN MY LIFE
YOU1000000102_S0000110	AND SEVENTEEN YEARS LATER I DID GO TO COLLEGE BUT I NAIVELY CHOSE A COLLEGE THAT WAS ALMOST AS EXPENSIVE AS STANFORD
YOU1000000102_S0000111	AND ALL OF MY WORKING CLASS PARENTS SAVINGS WERE BEING SPENT ON MY COLLEGE TUITION AFTER SIX MONTHS I COULDN'T SEE THE VALUE IN IT
YOU1000000102_S0000112	I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WANTED TO DO WITH MY LIFE AND NO IDEA HOW COLLEGE WAS GOING TO HELP ME FIGURE IT OUT
YOU1000000102_S0000113	AND HERE I WAS SPENDING ALL THE MONEY MY PARENTS HAD SAVED THEIR ENTIRE LIFE
YOU1000000102_S0000115	SO I DECIDED TO DROP OUT AND TRUST THAT IT WOULD ALL WORK OUT OK IT WAS PRETTY SCARY AT THE TIME BUT LOOKING BACK IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST DECISIONS I EVER MADE
YOU1000000102_S0000117	THE MINUTE I DROPPED OUT I COULD STOP TAKING THE REQUIRED CLASSES THAT DIDN'T INTEREST ME AND BEGIN DROPPING IN ON THE ONES THAT LOOKED FAR MORE INTERESTING
YOU1000000102_S0000119	IT WASN'T ALL ROMANTIC I DIDN'T HAVE A DORM ROOM SO I SLEPT ON THE FLOOR IN FRIENDS ROOMS I RETURNED COKE BOTTLES FOR THE FIVE CENT DEPOSIT TO BUY FOOD WITH
YOU1000000102_S0000120	AND I WOULD WALK THE SEVEN MILES ACROSS TOWN EVERY SUNDAY NIGHT TO GET ONE GOOD MEAL A WEEK AT THE HARE KRISHNA TEMPLE
YOU1000000102_S0000122	I LOVED IT AND MUCH OF WHAT I STUMBLED INTO BY FOLLOWING MY CURIOSITY AND INTUITION TURNED OUT TO BE PRICELESS LATER ON LET ME GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE
YOU1000000102_S0000124	REED COLLEGE AT THAT TIME OFFERED PERHAPS THE BEST CALLIGRAPHY INSTRUCTION IN THE COUNTRY
YOU1000000102_S0000125	THROUGHOUT THE CAMPUS EVERY POSTER EVERY LABEL ON EVERY DRAWER WAS BEAUTIFULLY HAND TELEGRAPHED BECAUSE I HAD DROPPED OUT
YOU1000000102_S0000126	AND DIDN'T HAVE TO TAKE THE NORMAL CLASSES I DECIDED TO TAKE A CALLIGRAPHY CLASS TO LEARN HOW TO DO THIS I LEARNED ABOUT SARAH AND SAND SERIF TYPEFACES
YOU1000000102_S0000127	ABOUT VARYING THE AMOUNT OF SPACE BETWEEN DIFFERENT LETTER COMBINATIONS ABOUT WHAT MAKES GREAT TYPOGRAPHY GREAT
YOU1000000102_S0000129	IT WAS BEAUTIFUL HISTORICAL ARTISTICALLY SUBTLE IN A WAY THAT SCIENCE CAN'T CAPTURE AND I FOUND IT FASCINATING
YOU1000000102_S0000131	NONE OF THIS HAD EVEN A HOPE OF ANY PRACTICAL APPLICATION IN MY LIFE
YOU1000000102_S0000133	BUT TEN YEARS LATER WHEN WE WERE DESIGNING THE FIRST MACINTOSH COMPUTER IT ALL CAME BACK TO ME AND WE DESIGNED IT ALL INTO THE MAC
YOU1000000102_S0000134	IT WAS THE FIRST COMPUTER WITH BEAUTIFUL TYPOGRAPHY IF I HAD NEVER DROPPED IN ON THAT SINGLE COURSE IN COLLEGE
YOU1000000102_S0000135	THE MAC WOULD HAVE NEVER HAD MULTIPLE TYPEFACES OR PROPORTIONALLY SPACED FONT AND SINCE WINDOWS JUST COPIED THE MAC IT'S LIKELY THAT NO PERSONAL COMPUTER WOULD HAVE
YOU1000000102_S0000137	IF I HAD NEVER DROPPED OUT I WOULD HAVE NEVER DROPPED IN ON THAT CALLIGRAPHY CLASS AND PERSONAL COMPUTERS MIGHT NOT HAVE THE WONDERFUL TYPOGRAPHY THAT THEY DO
YOU1000000102_S0000138	OF COURSE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONNECT THE DOTS LOOKING FORWARD WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE BUT IT WAS VERY VERY CLEAR LOOKING BACKWARDS TEN YEARS LATER
YOU1000000102_S0000139	AGAIN YOU CAN'T CONNECT THE DOTS LOOKING FORWARD YOU CAN ONLY CONNECT THEM LOOKING BACKWARDS SO YOU HAVE TO TRUST THAT THE DOTS WILL SOMEHOW CONNECT IN YOUR FUTURE
YOU1000000102_S0000140	YOU HAVE TO TRUST IN SOMETHING YOUR GUT DESTINY LIFE CARMA WHATEVER BECAUSE BELIEVING THAT THE DOTS WILL CONNECT
YOU1000000102_S0000141	DOWN THE ROAD WILL GIVE YOU THE CONFIDENCE TO FOLLOW YOUR HEART EVEN WHEN IT LEADS YOU OFF THE WELL WORN PATH AND THAT WILL MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE
YOU1000000102_S0000143	MY SECOND STORY IS ABOUT LOVE AND LOSS
YOU1000000102_S0000145	I WAS LUCKY I FOUND WHAT I LOVE TO DO EARLY IN LIFE WAS AND I STARTED APPLE IN MY PARENT'S GARAGE WHEN I WAS TWENTY WE WORKED HARD
YOU1000000102_S0000146	AND IN TEN YEARS APPLE HAD GROWN FROM JUST THE TWO OF US IN A GARAGE INTO A TWO BILLION DOLLARS COMPANY WITH OVER FOUR THOUSAND EMPLOYEES
YOU1000000102_S0000147	WE JUST RELEASED OUR FINEST CREATION THE MACINTOSH A YEAR EARLIER AND I JUST TURNED THIRTY
YOU1000000102_S0000149	AND THEN I GOT FIRED
YOU1000000102_S0000151	HOW CAN YOU GET FIRED FROM A COMPANY YOU STARTED
YOU1000000102_S0000153	WELL AS APPLE GREW WE HIRED SOMEONE WHO I THOUGHT WAS VERY TALENTED TO RUN THE COMPANY WITH ME AND FOR THE FIRST YEAR OR SO THINGS WENT WELL
YOU1000000102_S0000154	BUT THEN OUR VISIONS OF THE FUTURE BEGAN TO DIVERGE AND EVENTUALLY WE HAD A FALLING OUT WHEN WE DID OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS SIDED WITH HIM AND SO AT THIRTY I WAS OUT
YOU1000000102_S0000155	AND VERY PUBLICLY OUT WHAT HAD BEEN THE FOCUS OF MY ENTIRE ADULT LIFE WAS GONE AND IT WAS DEVASTATING
YOU1000000102_S0000157	I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO FOR A FEW MONTHS I FELT THAT I HAD LET THE PREVIOUS GENERATION OF ENTREPRENEURS DOWN THAT I HAD DROPPED THE BATON AS IT WAS BEING PASSED TO ME
YOU1000000102_S0000158	I MET WITH DAVID PACKARD AND BOB NOYCE AND TRIED TO APOLOGIZE FOR SCREWING UP SO BADLY
YOU1000000102_S0000160	I WAS A VERY PUBLIC FAILURE AND I EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT RUNNING AWAY FROM THE VALLEY BUT SOMETHING SLOWLY BEGAN TO DAWN ON ME I STILL LOVED WHAT I DID
YOU1000000102_S0000162	THE TURN OF EVENTS AT APPLE HAD NOT CHANGED THAT ONE BIT I'D BEEN REJECTED BUT I WAS STILL IN LOVE
YOU1000000102_S0000164	AND SO I DECIDED TO START OVER
YOU1000000102_S0000166	I DIDN'T SEE IT THEN BUT IT TURNED OUT THAT GETTING FIRED FROM APPLE WAS THE BEST THING THAT COULD HAVE EVER HAPPENED TO ME
YOU1000000102_S0000167	THE HEAVINESS OF BEING SUCCESSFUL WAS REPLACED BY THE LIGHTNESS OF BEING A BEGINNER AGAIN LESS SURE ABOUT EVERYTHING IT FREED ME TO ENTER ONE OF THE MOST CREATIVE PERIODS OF MY LIFE
YOU1000000102_S0000168	DURING THE NEXT FIVE YEARS I STARTED A COMPANY NAMED NEXT ANOTHER COMPANY NAMED PIXAR AND FELL IN LOVE WITH AN AMAZING WOMAN WHO WOULD BECOME MY WIFE
YOU1000000102_S0000169	PIXAR WENT ON TO CREATE THE WORLD'S FIRST COMPUTER ANIMATED FEATURE FILM TOY STORY AND IS NOW THE MOST SUCCESSFUL ANIMATION STUDIO IN THE WORLD
YOU1000000102_S0000171	IN A REMARKABLE TURN OF EVENTS APPLE BOUGHT NEXT AND I RETURNED TO APPLE AND THE TECHNOLOGY WE DEVELOPED IT NEXT IS AT THE HEART OF APPLE'S CURRENT RENAISSANCE
YOU1000000102_S0000172	AND LARINE AND I HAVE A WONDERFUL FAMILY TOGETHER
YOU1000000102_S0000174	I'M PRETTY SURE NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF I HADN'T BEEN FIRED FROM APPLE IT WAS AWFUL TASTING MEDICINE BUT I GUESS THE PATIENT NEEDED IT
YOU1000000102_S0000176	SOMETIMES LIFE SOMETIMES LIFE'S GONNA HIT YOU IN THE HEAD WITH A BRICK DON'T LOSE FAITH
YOU1000000102_S0000178	I'M CONVINCED THAT THE ONLY THING THAT KEPT ME GOING WAS THAT I LOVED WHAT I DID YOU'VE GOT TO FIND WHAT YOU LOVE AND THAT IS AS TRUE FOR WORK AS IT IS FOR YOUR LOVERS
YOU1000000102_S0000179	YOUR WORK IS GOING TO FILL A LARGE PART OF YOUR LIFE AND THE ONLY WAY TO BE TRULY SATISFIED IS TO DO WHAT YOU BELIEVE IS GREAT WORK
YOU1000000102_S0000180	AND THE ONLY WAY TO DO GREAT WORK IS TO LOVE WHAT YOU DO IF YOU HAVEN'T FOUND IT YET KEEP LOOKING
YOU1000000102_S0000182	AND DON'T SETTLE AS WITH ALL MATTERS OF THE HEART YOU'LL KNOW WHEN YOU FIND IT AND LIKE ANY GREAT RELATIONSHIP IT JUST GETS BETTER AND BETTER
YOU1000000102_S0000183	AS THE YEARS ROLL ON SO KEEP LOOKING DON'T SETTLE
YOU1000000102_S0000185	MY THIRD STORY IS ABOUT DEATH
YOU1000000102_S0000187	WHEN I WAS SEVENTEEN I READ A QUOTE THAT WENT SOMETHING LIKE IF YOU LIVE EACH DAY AS IF IT WAS YOUR LAST SOMEDAY YOU'LL MOST CERTAINLY BE RIGHT
YOU1000000102_S0000189	IT MADE AN IMPRESSION ON ME AND SINCE THEN FOR THE PAST THIRTY THREE YEARS I'VE LOOKED IN THE MIRROR EVERY MORNING AND ASKED MYSELF
YOU1000000102_S0000190	IF TODAY WERE THE LAST DAY OF MY LIFE WHAT I WANT TO DO WHAT I AM ABOUT TO DO TODAY AND WHENEVER THE ANSWER HAS BEEN NO FOR TOO MANY DAYS IN A ROW
YOU1000000102_S0000191	I KNOW I NEED TO CHANGE SOMETHING
YOU1000000102_S0000193	REMEMBERING THAT I'LL BE DEAD SOON IS THE MOST IMPORTANT TOOL I'VE EVER ENCOUNTERED TO HELP ME MAKE THE BIG CHOICES IN LIFE BECAUSE ALMOST EVERYTHING
YOU1000000102_S0000194	ALL EXTERNAL EXPECTATIONS ALL PRIDE ALL FEAR OF EMBARRASSMENT OR FAILURE THESE THINGS JUST FALL AWAY IN THE FACE OF DEATH LEAVING ONLY WHAT IS TRULY IMPORTANT
YOU1000000102_S0000195	REMEMBERING THAT YOU ARE GOING TO DIE IS THE BEST WAY I KNOW TO AVOID THE TRAP OF THINKING YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO LOSE YOU ARE ALREADY NAKED
YOU1000000102_S0000196	THERE IS NO REASON NOT TO FOLLOW YOUR HEART
YOU1000000102_S0000198	ABOUT A YEAR AGO I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER
YOU1000000102_S0000200	I HAD A SCAN AT SEVEN THIRTY IN THE MORNING AND IT CLEARLY SHOWED A TUMOR ON MY PANCREAS I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT A PANCREAS WAS
YOU1000000102_S0000201	THE DOCTORS TOLD ME THIS WAS ALMOST CERTAINLY A TYPE OF CANCER THAT IS INCURABLE AND THAT I SHOULD EXPECT TO LIVE NO LONGER THAN THREE TO SIX MONTHS
YOU1000000102_S0000203	MY DOCTOR ADVISED ME TO GO HOME AND GET MY AFFAIRS IN ORDER WHICH IS DOCTORS CODE FOR PREPARE TO DIE
YOU1000000102_S0000204	IT MEANS TO TRY AND TELL YOUR KIDS EVERYTHING
YOU1000000102_S0000206	YOU THOUGHT YOU'D HAVE THE NEXT TEN YEARS TO TELL THEM IN JUST A FEW MONTHS IT MEANS TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS BUTTONED UP SO THAT WILL BE AS EASY AS POSSIBLE FOR YOUR FAMILY
YOU1000000102_S0000207	IT MEANS TO SAY OUR GOODBYES
YOU1000000102_S0000209	I LIVE WITH THAT DIAGNOSIS ALL DAY LATER THAT EVENING I HAD A BIOPSY WHERE THEY STUCK AN ENDOSCOPE DOWN MY THROAT THROUGH MY STOMACH AND INTO MY INTESTINES
YOU1000000102_S0000210	PUT A NEEDLE INTO MY PANCREAS AND GOT A FEW CELLS FROM THE TUMOUR I WAS SEDATED BUT MY WIFE WHO WAS THERE TOLD ME THAT WHEN THEY VIEWED THE CELLS UNDER A MICROSCOPE
YOU1000000102_S0000211	THE DOCTOR STARTED CRYING BECAUSE IT TURNED OUT TO BE A VERY RARE FORM OF PANCREATIC CANCER THAT IS CURABLE WITH SURGERY
YOU1000000102_S0000212	I HAD THE SURGERY AND THANKFULLY I'M FINE NOW
YOU1000000102_S0000214	THIS WAS THE CLOSEST I'VE BEEN TO FACING DEATH AND I HOPE IT'S THE CLOSEST I GET FOR A FEW MORE DECADES HAVING LIVED THROUGH IT
YOU1000000102_S0000215	I CAN NOW SAY THIS TO YOU WITH A BIT MORE CERTAINTY THAN WHEN DEATH WAS A USEFUL BUT PURELY INTELLECTUAL CONCEPT
YOU1000000102_S0000217	NO ONE WANTS TO DIE EVEN PEOPLE WHO WANT TO GO TO HEAVEN DON'T WANT TO DIE TO GET THERE
YOU1000000102_S0000219	AND YET DEATH IS THE DESTINATION WE ALL SHARE NO ONE HAS EVER ESCAPED IT AND THAT IS AS IT SHOULD BE
YOU1000000102_S0000220	BECAUSE DEATH IS VERY LIKELY THE SINGLE BEST INVENTION OF LIFE IT'S LIFE'S CHANGE AGENT IT CLEARS OUT THE OLD TO MAKE WAY FOR THE NEW
YOU1000000102_S0000222	RIGHT NOW THE NEW IS YOU
YOU1000000102_S0000224	BUT SOMEDAY NOT TOO LONG FROM NOW YOU WILL GRADUALLY BECOME THE OLD AND BE CLEARED AWAY
YOU1000000102_S0000226	SORRY TO BE SO DRAMATIC BUT IT'S QUITE TRUE
YOU1000000102_S0000228	YOUR TIME IS LIMITED SO DON'T WASTE IT LIVING SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE DON'T BE TRAPPED BY DOGMA WHICH IS LIVING WITH THE RESULTS OF OTHER PEOPLE'S THINKING
YOU1000000102_S0000229	DON'T LET THE NOISE OF OTHERS' OPINIONS DROWN OUT YOUR OWN INNER VOICE AND MOST IMPORTANT HAVE THE COURAGE TO FOLLOW YOUR HEART AND INTUITION
YOU1000000102_S0000230	THEY SOMEHOW ALREADY KNOW WHAT YOU TRULY WANT TO BECOME EVERYTHING ELSE IS SECONDARY
YOU1000000102_S0000232	WHEN I WAS YOUNG THERE WAS AN AMAZING PUBLICATION CALLED THE WHOLE EARTH CATALOG WHICH WAS ONE OF THE BIBLES OF MY GENERATION
YOU1000000102_S0000233	IT WAS CREATED BY A FELLOW NAMED STUART BRAND NOT FAR FROM HERE IN MENLO PARK AND HE BROUGHT IT TO LIFE WITH HIS POETIC TOUCH
YOU1000000102_S0000234	THIS WAS IN THE LATE SIXTY S BEFORE PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND DESKTOP PUBLISHING SO IT WAS ALL MADE WITH TYPEWRITERS SCISSORS AND POLAROID CAMERAS
YOU1000000102_S0000235	IT WAS SORT OF LIKE GOOGLE IN PAPERBACK FORM THIRTY FIVE YEARS BEFORE GOOGLE CAME ALONG IT WAS IDEALISTIC OVERFLOWING WITH NEAT TOOLS AND GREAT NOTIONS
YOU1000000102_S0000237	STUART AND HIS TEAM PUT OUT SEVERAL ISSUES OF THE WHOLE EARTH CATALOG AND THEN WHEN IT HAD RUN ITS COURSE THEY PUT OUT A FINAL ISSUE
YOU1000000102_S0000238	IT WAS THE MID NINETEEN SEVENTY S AND I WAS YOUR AGE
YOU1000000102_S0000240	ON THE BACK COVER OF THEIR FINAL ISSUE WAS A PHOTOGRAPH OF AN EARLY MORNING COUNTRY ROAD
YOU1000000102_S0000242	THE KIND YOU MIGHT FIND YOURSELF HITCHHIKING ON IF YOU WERE SO ADVENTUROUS BENEATH IT WERE THE WORDS STAY HUNGRY STAY FOOLISH
YOU1000000102_S0000243	IT WAS THEIR FAREWELL MESSAGE AS THEY SIGNED OFF STAY HUNGRY STAY FOOLISH AND I HAVE ALWAYS WISHED THAT FOR MYSELF

YOU1000000109_S0000004	RONALDO
YOU1000000109_S0000006	IT'S A WARM INDEED VERY HUMID NIGHT HERE IN SOCHI THERE IS A VERY TANGIBLE SENSE OF ANTICIPATION
YOU1000000109_S0000007	IT'S PORTUGAL'S FIRST GAME AT THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN FIFA WORLD CUP RUSSIA CRISTIANO RONALDO IS APPEARING AT HIS FOURTH WORLD CUP
YOU1000000109_S0000008	THIRD IN WHICH HE'LL CAPTURE HIS COUNTRY
YOU1000000109_S0000009	PORTUGAL WENT INTO THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN WORLD CUP AS EUROPEAN CHAMPIONS THEY WON EURO TWENTY SIXTEEN BIT FRANCE TO HOST IN THE FINAL
YOU1000000109_S0000010	I THINK THERE WERE A LOT OF EXPECTATIONS ABOUT PORTUGAL GOING INTO THE WORLD CUP THAT PERHAPS THEY COULD FINALLY GO FARTHER THAN JUST THE GROUP STAGE AND THE ROUND OF SIXTEEN
YOU1000000109_S0000011	CRISTIANO FACES THE NATION HE HAS JUST SPENT THE LAST NINE YEARS PLYING HIS TRADE IN SPAIN
YOU1000000109_S0000012	I THINK THAT DEFINITELY MOTIVATED RONALDO HIMSELF YOU KNOW A LOT OF THOSE PLAYERS WOULD HAVE BEEN HIS TEAMMATES OF COURSE A REAL MADRID
YOU1000000109_S0000013	REALLY WANTED TO LEAVE EVERYTHING ON THE FIELD AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE SAW
YOU1000000109_S0000015	RONALDO IS THAT A PENALTY IT IS
YOU1000000109_S0000016	IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG FOR SEVEN TO MAKE HIS MARK
YOU1000000109_S0000017	INSIDE THE OPENING THREE MINUTES CRISTIANO RONALDO FELL IN THE PENALTY AREA
YOU1000000109_S0000018	CRISTIANO NOW HAS THE CHANCE TO SCORE FOR HIS COUNTRY FROM THE PENALTY SPOT HE'S BEEN HERE BEFORE
YOU1000000109_S0000021	TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD CRISTIANO RONALDO
YOU1000000109_S0000023	WAITS FOR FREE POOLAS WHISTLE COMPOSE HIMSELF
YOU1000000109_S0000025	AND SCORES
YOU1000000109_S0000027	HE HAD BEEN AT THE TWO YEARS PRIOR AND THEY MADE IT TO THE FINALS LOSING OUT DEGREE
YOU1000000109_S0000028	HE WAS ALREADY ARGUABLY PORTUGAL'S MOST POTENT ATTACKING WEAPON AND THAT WAS A REALLY GOOD PORTUGAL TEAM
YOU1000000109_S0000029	EARLY NOTES TEAM THAT RONALDO FOUND HIMSELF PART OF WAS A PHENOMENAL TEAM IN TERMS OF TALENT
YOU1000000109_S0000030	ONE REASON WHY RONALDO DID WELL AT THAT TOURNAMENT HE WASN'T PORTUGAL'S SOLE FOCUS POINT
YOU1000000109_S0000031	YOU KNOW YOU HAD SOME SODARO WHO IS DOING VERY WELL CAUSE YOU HAD LOUIS FIGEL SHE HAD DECO
YOU1000000109_S0000032	THE NETHERLANDS GAME IN THE LAST SIXTEEN YEARS IS A BRUTAL EXPERIENCE RONALDO
YOU1000000109_S0000033	THE NETHERLANDS TRIED TO TAKE HIM OUT OF THE GAME TAKE HIM OUT OF THE EQUATION AND THAT'S WHAT THEY DID AN ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS TACKLE
YOU1000000109_S0000034	THAT WAS A VERY SCANDALOUS GAME WHERE YOU HAD SIXTEEN YELLOW CARDS YOU HAD FOUR RED CARDS I MEAN THAT WAS A REALLY DIFFICULT GAME FOR BOTH TEAMS FOR CHRISTIAN THAT WAS A LEARNING MOMENT
YOU1000000109_S0000035	AS I GOT OLDER AND GET FITTER AND MORE MUSCULAR IF YOU LIKE STRONGER THAT'S PROBABLY A GAME WE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RIDE MORE
YOU1000000109_S0000036	IT WAS MORE WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT GAME AGAINST ENGLAND THAT TOOK ALL THE HEADLINES
YOU1000000109_S0000037	THERE'S THIS SORT OF RUN AGAINST RICARDO CARVALLO
YOU1000000109_S0000038	AND RONI AND ALL THE ENGLISH TEAM SAY THAT CHRISTIAN GO TO THE RIFER TO SAY GIVE HIM RED CARD
YOU1000000109_S0000039	AND THAT IS WALKING OVER TO THE BENCH HE GIVES A NICE LITTLE WINK AND OF COURSE EVERYBODY IN ENGLAND UNDERSTANDABLY WAS VERY UPSET
YOU1000000109_S0000040	I MEAN DEFINITELY I THINK WAS AN EARLY SIGN OF WHAT WAS TO COME OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS IN TERMS OF CHRISTIAN RONALDO AND HIS PERSONALITY
YOU1000000109_S0000041	THE ENGLAND GAME ACTUALLY ENDED PERFECTLY FOR AUTO DESPITE ALL THIS CONTROVERSY AS HE TOOK THE WINNING PENALTY IN THE SHOOTOUT
YOU1000000109_S0000043	IT'S ALL OVER FOR ENGLAND PORTUGAL GO INTO THE LAST FOUR
YOU1000000109_S0000044	THEY OVERCAME THEM ON PENALTIES AND THEN LOST TO A FRENCH TEAM WAS INSPIRED BY INTENDANT WAS ACTUALLY EXCEPTIONAL IN THAT GAME
YOU1000000109_S0000045	AND HIS WORK IN THE MOMENT IS IN EDEN
YOU1000000109_S0000046	PORTUGAL TRIED TO GET BACK INTO IT THEY WERE QUITE CLOSE ON A FEW OCCASIONS
YOU1000000109_S0000047	BUT WHAT A CHANCE
YOU1000000109_S0000048	IT JUST WASN'T TO BE
YOU1000000109_S0000050	CRISTIANO RONALDO AGAINST DAVID
YOU1000000109_S0000051	IT'S PORTUGAL WAS THERE EVER ANY DOUBT I JUST HAD TO BE HERE
YOU1000000109_S0000052	PORTUGAL'S LEAD ONLY LAST TWENTY MINUTES
YOU1000000109_S0000053	PEPE GETS THE HEAD UP AND GOES DOWN PLAY CONTINUES IT'S DIEGO COSTA CAN HE GET THE SHOT AWAY COSTA SCORES
YOU1000000109_S0000055	RONALDO'S MENTALITY ISN'T IT I THINK THAT'S WHAT MAKES HIM THE PLAYER HE IS
YOU1000000109_S0000056	JUST BEFORE HALFTIME CRISTIANO SLIPPED THE BALL ON THE EDGE OF THE BOX
YOU1000000109_S0000057	RONALDO WITH THE SHOW IT'S GOT ONE FROM DAVID AND CHRISTIANA RENALDO GET PORTUGAL'S SECOND GOAL OF THE NIGHT
YOU1000000109_S0000058	PORTUGAL ARE BACK IN FRONT TONIGHT CRISTIANO IS ON A MISSION AGAINST SPAIN PERHAPS MOTIVATED BY REVENGE FOR WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST
YOU1000000109_S0000062	RONALD TWENTY TEN S A VERY VERY DIFFERENT RONALDA TO RONALDA OF TWO THOUSAND AND SIX
YOU1000000109_S0000063	BETWEEN THOSE TWO WORLD CUPS HE SIGNS FOR MADRID HE BECOMES THE MOST EXPENSIVE PLAYER TO SIGN FOR THE CLUB AND IN THE WORLD AT THAT POINT IN TIME FOR NINETY FOUR MILLION EUROS
YOU1000000109_S0000064	AND AT THAT POINT HE HAD BECOME THE LEADER AND THE CAPTAIN OF PORTUGAL
YOU1000000109_S0000065	THE ROOM IN WHICH THE TURN FOR RONALDO MAKE ROOM FOR THE SHOT OF THE POST WATER STRIKE
YOU1000000109_S0000066	HE HAD A DIFFERENT MANAGER TO PLAY UNDER FIRST HE HAD DIFFERENT TEAMMATES ARGUABLY THE BEST PLAYER IN THE WORLD AFTER WINNING CHAMPIONS LEAD WITH MANCHESTER UNITED THE ATTENTION IS DRAWN TO HIM MUCH MORE THAN BEFORE
YOU1000000109_S0000067	HERE'S RONALDO NO FREE KICK
YOU1000000109_S0000068	AS KRAGE THE COACH HAD COME IN UNFORTUNATELY FOR PORTUGAL IT ALL WENT HORRIBLY WRONG THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RONALDO AND KRAGE WAS VERY STRANGE
YOU1000000109_S0000069	I THINK THAT WAS REALLY STEMMED FROM THE TACTICS EMPLOYED BY CROSS
YOU1000000109_S0000070	HIS WHOLE TACTIC SEEMED TO BE LET'S JUST MAKE OUR THEM AS DIFFICULT TO SCORE AGAINST AS POSSIBLE AND OUR ATTACKING SISTER WOULD JUST BE WHAT THE BALL UP TO RONALDO AND LET HIM WORK SOME MAGIC ON HIS OWN
YOU1000000109_S0000071	AND IT JUST DIDN'T WORK AT ALL
YOU1000000109_S0000072	GREAT OPPORTUNITY HERE FOR BRAZIL TO COME
YOU1000000109_S0000073	ONCE DURING THAT TORMENT ALBEIT WAS EXCELLENT GOAL AGAINST NORTH KOREA WHERE HE SORT OF JUGGLING ACT WHERE HE BALANCED THE BALL ON THE BACK OF HIS NECK AND SORT OF ROLLED IT OVER THE TOP OF HIS HEAD AND THEN SCORED
YOU1000000109_S0000074	THEN IT WAS THE DERBY MARIAN DERBY
YOU1000000109_S0000075	AND THEY GOT KNOCKED OUT TO SPAIN WHO AT LEAST FOR THEM A BIT OF COMFORT IS KNOWING THAT THEY WENT ON TO WIN THE WHOLE TOURNAMENT ALTOGETHER
YOU1000000109_S0000076	THEY WERE FABULOUS SPANISH SITE NOBODY REALLY COULD TAKE THEM APART NOBODY COULD REALLY BEAT THEM AT ALL
YOU1000000109_S0000077	TRUE THAT SPAIN HAVE BEAUTIFUL THAN THIS
YOU1000000109_S0000078	I THINK THERE WAS A LOT OF PRESSURE ON CHRISTIAN RONALDO TO BE THIS BIG FIGURE SINCE HE WAS THIS WORLDWIDE SUPERSTAR BUT UNFORTUNATELY HE CAME UP AGAINST
YOU1000000109_S0000079	THIS SPANISH WAR THAT HE JUST WASN'T ABLE TO BREAK THROUGH
YOU1000000109_S0000080	AFTER THE GAME AND WAS ASKED WHAT WENT WRONG AND TO THE GERMANS TO ASK CARS WERE IN QUITE A POINTED
YOU1000000109_S0000081	THINK IT'S ONE WORLD CUP WHICH YOU CAN'T REALLY BLAME HIM AT ALL FOR HIS LACK OF PRODUCTION IT WAS DEFINITELY JUST A TEAM WASN'T SET UP TO GET THE BEST OUT OF HIM AT ALL
YOU1000000109_S0000082	THE WORLD CUP DISAPPOINTING IN THE FINISH DISAPPOINTING AND NOT NOT SCORING THE GOALS THAT PEOPLE EXPECTED HIM TO SCORE BUT IT WAS THE FOUNDATION FOR HIM AS A PLAYER TO TO IMPROVE ON AND BUILD
YOU1000000109_S0000084	RONALDO WITH THE SHOW IT'S GOING
YOU1000000109_S0000085	EIGHT YEARS LATER AND PORTUGAL ARE NOW THE ONES WITH THE UPPER HAND THEY LEAD TO ONE WITH FORTY FIVE MINUTES LEFT ON THE CLOCK
YOU1000000109_S0000086	CRISTIANO RONALDO HAS TURNED THIS GROUP MATCH BACK IN PORTUGAL'S FAVOUR
YOU1000000109_S0000087	WITH SPAIN APPLYING MORE PRESSURE THERE'S NOT TOO MUCH CHRISTIANO CAN DO EXCEPT HOPE HIS DEFENSE WILL HOLD FIRM
YOU1000000109_S0000088	SILVER WITH A LITTLE CHIN BACK ACROSS OLD TUNE DIEGO COSTA STRIKES AGAIN
YOU1000000109_S0000089	A SIMPLE FREE KICK MOVE FROM SPAIN AND FOR THE SECOND TIME TONIGHT IN SOCHI SPAIN EQUALIZED
YOU1000000109_S0000090	THEN THERE'S NOT MUCH THE DEFENCE CAN DO WHEN THE BALL FALLS TO NATO
YOU1000000109_S0000091	IT MIGHT DROP FOR THE SHOT HERE WHAT A SHOT THAT IS NOT THE MAN WHO GAVE AWAY THE PENALTY EARLY ON IN THIS MATCH
YOU1000000109_S0000093	HAS REDEEMED HIMSELF IN STYLE
YOU1000000109_S0000094	THANKS TO A WONDER STRIKE SPAIN HAVE TURNED THE GAME AROUND THEY NOW LEAD THREE TWO AND IT LOOKS LIKE HISTORY IS SET TO REPEAT ITSELF
YOU1000000109_S0000095	IT SEEMS CRISTIANO CAN'T SHAKE HIS BAD LUCK AT THE WORLD CUP

YOU1000000109_S0000098	DREADFUL DAY AND AWFUL START FOR PORTUGAL
YOU1000000109_S0000099	IN THE WAY THAT WE HAD PROGRESSED QUITE A LOT BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND SIX AND TWO THOUSAND AND TEN HE PROGRESSED EQUALLY A FAR DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN AND TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN HE WENT INTO THAT TOURNAMENT CHAMPION LIKE WINNER AROUND MADRID BALLADUR WINNER
YOU1000000109_S0000100	IT WAS NOT A GREAT TOURNAMENT HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS PHYSICAL PROBLEM BUT HE WANTED TO STAY WANT TO BE THERE
YOU1000000109_S0000101	SO HE DECIDED TO PLAY THROUGH THE PAIN AND TO PLAY THROUGH THE INJURY
YOU1000000109_S0000102	BECAUSE HE FELT THAT WITHOUT HIM THEY WEREN'T GOING TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE BUT IT DIDN'T MATTER IN THE END BECAUSE IT JUST DIDN'T IT DIDN'T WORK OUT
YOU1000000109_S0000103	GERMANY WAS PHENOMENAL TWENTY FOURTEEN BILLY WENT ON TO WIN THE TOURNAMENT BUT NEVERTHELESS TO GET FAIL BECAUSE PORTUGAL'S HEAVIEST DEFEAT AT A WORLD CUP WAS PRETTY HUMILIATING
YOU1000000109_S0000104	PORTUGAL WERE REALLY RONALDO CENTRIC AT THIS TIME
YOU1000000109_S0000105	AGAINST THE UNITED STATES THAT DEFENSE THEY THEY REALLY PUT A CLAMP DOWN AND IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR HIM
YOU1000000109_S0000106	EDWIN WITH ALLEN BRADLEY CHANCE FOR US LET'S GO
YOU1000000109_S0000107	IT'S QUITE AMAZING ACTUALLY THAT RENATO MANAGED TO PULL OUT OF THE BAG A CHANCE TO KEEP THEIR WORLD CUP ALIVE JUST BY THE SLIMNESS OF FRED'S VIRTUALLY THE LAST KICK AT THE GAME
YOU1000000109_S0000109	UNLESS WE HAVE A MOST DRAMATIC TWIST IN THE FINAL SECONDS NOW INTO THE LAST THIRTY AND WE HAVE IT'S A DREAM OF A CROSS FROM RONALDO
YOU1000000109_S0000110	OVERALL BURIES IT
YOU1000000109_S0000111	HE WAS GOING TO PLAY UNTIL THE LAST WHISTLE OF EVERY GAME THAT'S HIS MENTALITY THAT IS WHAT HE DRIVES FOR HE'S NOT GOING TO REST
YOU1000000109_S0000112	I THINK HE FIGURES YOU KNOW EVEN IF I HAVE YOU KNOW MY LEG AMPUTATED I'M GONNA GO OUT THERE AND I'M GONNA STILL TRY AND SCORE OR AT LEAST SET SOMEBODY ELSE UP TO SCORE
YOU1000000109_S0000113	BECAUSE HE'S JUST THAT FOCUSED AND THAT DETERMINED
YOU1000000109_S0000114	THE LAST GAME AGAINST GARNER ALL SORTS OF PERMUTATIONS PORTUGAL WAS STILL IN SHOW TO QUALIFY BUT BASICALLY THEY NEEDED TO WIN AND WIN BIG
YOU1000000109_S0000115	RONALDO MANAGED TO SCORE A GOAL BUT IT WAS ALREADY QUITE NEAR TOWARDS THE END OF THE GAME
YOU1000000109_S0000116	MAYBE TORONADO YES HE HAS A NUMBER FIFTY OF HIS INTERNATIONAL CAREER
YOU1000000109_S0000117	TOO LITTLE TOO LATE AT THAT POINT AND THE DAMAGE WAS DONE AND THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO GET OUT OF THE GROUP AND THEY CRASHED OUT VERY EARLY ON IN THE WORLD CUP
YOU1000000109_S0000118	IN A VERY DISAPPOINTING WORLD CUP FOR PORTUGAL HE WAS PROBABLY PORTUGAL'S BEST PLAYER
YOU1000000109_S0000119	PROBABLY AT THAT MOMENT MAYBE THAT'S THE GAP BETWEEN PORTUGAL'S BEST PLAYER RONALDO AND THE REST OF THE TEAM WAS MOST EXPOSED
YOU1000000109_S0000120	IT'S DEFINITELY WORLD CUP WHERE PORTUGAL PAID A PRICE FOR JUST NOT BEING FIT ENOUGH
YOU1000000109_S0000122	RONALD GOES DOWN GETS A FREE KICK CHALLENGES BY KNOW THIS IS A KEY MOMENT WE KNOW WHO'S GOING TO STRIKE IT
YOU1000000109_S0000123	THE GAME APPROACHES ITS FINAL MINUTES CRISTIANO STANDS OVER A FREE KICK DISPLAYING HIS TRADEMARK STANCE
YOU1000000109_S0000124	THIS FOR HIS HAT TRICK AND TO SAVE PORTUGAL FROM DEFEAT
YOU1000000109_S0000126	RONALDO
YOU1000000109_S0000128	GENIUS ABSOLUTE GENIUS WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT
YOU1000000109_S0000129	IT WAS A PHENOMENAL TO EVERYBODY AT THAT JUST KIND OF FELL OUT OF THE SEA AND SAID OKAY IT'S NOT SPAIN'S DAY WE JUST NEED TO ACCEPT THAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT CHRISTIAN RONALDO
YOU1000000109_S0000130	YOU DON'T SEE THOSE INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCES AND WILL CUT THAT OFF
YOU1000000109_S0000131	ACTUALLY SUMS UP RONALDO BRILLIANT GOAL SPORTING A HUGE GAME
YOU1000000109_S0000132	EXEMPLARY PERFECTION AND IT'S A PATRICK FOR CRISTIANO RONALDO
YOU1000000109_S0000134	IN THEIR NEXT GAME AGAINST MOROCCO CRISTIANI'S FINE FORM CONTINUES AS HE SCORES THE DECISIVE GOAL IN A PROMISING PERFORMANCE
YOU1000000109_S0000136	IS A SENSATION
YOU1000000109_S0000138	WOULD BE HIS EIGHTY FIFTH GOAL IN THE INTERNATIONAL SCENE HE WOULD PASS FOR PUSKAS
YOU1000000109_S0000139	AND SO HE THEN BECAME THE HIGHEST GOALSCORER IN EUROPE IN INTERNATIONAL FOOTBALL AND THE SECOND OVERALL IN THE WORLD
YOU1000000109_S0000140	AGAINST IRAN A CHARISMA WANDEL PUTS PORTUGAL AHEAD
YOU1000000109_S0000141	WAS CRISTIANI'S WORLD CUP LUCK TURNING AT LAST
YOU1000000109_S0000142	THIS WILL GIVE PORTUGAL BREATHING SPACE
YOU1000000109_S0000144	RONALDO IS DENIED
YOU1000000109_S0000146	AND THE GAME AND THE GROUP ARE STILL VERY MUCH ALIVE
YOU1000000109_S0000147	CHRISTIAN'S MISSED PENALTY ULTIMATELY COST PORTUGAL THE TOP SPOT IN THEIR GROUP
YOU1000000109_S0000148	WHICH MEANS THEY'LL FACE URUGUAY IN THE ROUND OF SIXTEEN A FORMIDABLE OPPONENT
YOU1000000109_S0000149	AROUND SIXTEEN THEY RUN INTO WHICH IS A TOUGH MATCHUP BECAUSE THEIR DEFENSE IS GEARED IT'S VERY PHYSICAL REALLY CAUSED PROBLEMS FOR CHRISTIAN ROAD
YOU1000000109_S0000150	WHO WAS ABLE TO DEAL WITH THE CONSIDERABLE THREAT NOT HIS FINEST HOUR FROM A FREE KICK CARES OVER ON THAT FAR SIDE AND IT'S PINPOINT
YOU1000000109_S0000152	DANGEROUS CROSSVILLE THEM AGAIN
YOU1000000109_S0000153	FORTUNATELY FOR PORTUGAL THEY REALLY ONLY GOT GOING IN THE SECOND HALF WHEN THEY WERE REALLY BACKS AGAINST THE WALL
YOU1000000109_S0000154	ADRIAN SILVER SHOT THE DEFLECTION FOR A CORNER
YOU1000000109_S0000155	HAS DONE IT
YOU1000000109_S0000157	THERE'S THE ANSWER THEY WERE LOOKING FOR
YOU1000000109_S0000159	BUT THEY REALLY DIDN'T DO THEMSELVES JUSTICE AND I THINK YOUR WORD DESERVED WINNERS AT THE END TWO BRILLIANT GOALS YOU HAVE TO SAY
YOU1000000109_S0000160	HERNANDEZ FROM THREE FOR A MOMENT HERE COVAL BRILLIANT THAT IS PURE GOLD
YOU1000000109_S0000161	FOR THE FOURTH TIME IN HIS CAREER CRISTIANO RONALDO IS KNOCKED OUT OF THE WORLD CUP
YOU1000000109_S0000162	IT'S ALL OVER AND MAYBE IT IS THE END IN TERMS OF WORLD CUP FOR THE GREAT CRISTIANO RONALDO
YOU1000000109_S0000163	IN THE WORLD CUP HE SHOWED ONE LAST TIME IF IT IS THE LAST TIME THAT HE IS SUCH A PROLIFIC GHOST THAT IS LEGENDARY
YOU1000000109_S0000164	THINK TWENTY EIGHTEEN IN A WAY SUMS UP RENALDO'S INTERNATIONAL CAREER WHICH IS EXCEPTIONALLY TALENTED PLAYER FOR THE BIG OCCASION BUT JUST PART OF A TEAM THAT BAR FRANCE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN HAS NEVER BEEN GOOD ENOUGH TO WIN ONE OF THE MAJOR HONOR
YOU1000000109_S0000165	WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT WILL BE HIS LAST WORLD CUP I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE I THINK THERE'S A VERY GOOD CHANCE THAT WE COULD SEE HIM AT CASA TWENTY TWENTY TWO HE'LL BE THIRTY SEVEN YEARS OLD
YOU1000000109_S0000166	THE TIME THAT WE CUT ROLLS AROUND
YOU1000000109_S0000168	NATO WILL NOT BE PORTUGAL'S SOLE ATTACKING THREAT SO YOU COULD ARGUE THAT THE STATE IS PERFECTLY SET FOR HIM TO REALLY THRIVE IN THIS WORLD
YOU1000000109_S0000169	AS PART OF AN EXCITING ATTACKING TEAM AS THE ELDER STATESMAN AND PERHAPS PUT THOSE FORMER WORLD CUPS WHERE HE DIDN'T PERHAPS DO HIMSELF JUSTICE YOU KNOW PUT THAT TO RIGHTS
YOU1000000110_S0000002	IN HIS LIFE ALL FORCE ALL WILL THE NETHERLANDS
YOU1000000110_S0000003	SAVE YOU
YOU1000000110_S0000005	ARGENTINA SENT UP FIRST OF COURSE MEAL
YOU1000000110_S0000007	MAN FOR ALL MOMENTS
YOU1000000110_S0000009	MANY ON PLANET FOOTBALL THE NUMBER ONE THE MAN
YOU1000000110_S0000011	THE TWENTY FOURTEEN FIFA WORLD CUP BRAZIL WAS PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT TOURNAMENT IN LIONEL MESSI CAREER
YOU1000000110_S0000013	TWENTY FOURTEEN THERE WAS STILL A LOT OF EXPECTATION FOR THIS PLAYER WHO HAD BEEN BREAKING ALL SORTS OF GOAL SCORING RECORDS AT CLUB LEVEL
YOU1000000110_S0000014	BUT NEVER TRULY EXCELLED AT INTERNATIONAL LEVEL
YOU1000000110_S0000017	MADE SURE THAT THEIR FIRST MATCH AGAINST BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA WENT TO PLAN
YOU1000000110_S0000018	LIKEWISE CAMPANARO DEVILISH DELIBERATING THE ARGENTINE A BROKEN THROUGH
YOU1000000110_S0000021	MESS KEPT GOING IT'S MESSY
YOU1000000110_S0000023	IN A WIN FOR ARGENTINA WHERE THEY LOOKED SOLID AND SET UP THE TOURNAMENT FOR THE EXPECTATION THAT THEY COULD GO A LONG WAY
YOU1000000110_S0000025	HOWEVER THE NEXT GAME AGAINST MINE IRAN WASN'T QUITE SO STRAIGHTFORWARD
YOU1000000110_S0000026	ARGENTINA THE TOP TEAM IN SOUTH AMERICA QUALIFYING AGAINST IRAN
YOU1000000110_S0000027	IT WAS A TOUGH GAME FOR ARGENTINA AROUND DEFENDED REALLY WELL ARGENTINA DIDN'T HAVE THAT MANY CHANCES DURING THE GAME
YOU1000000110_S0000028	THIS IS NOT ARGENTINA'S DAY SO FAR
YOU1000000110_S0000029	WIN WOULD SEND ARGENTINA THROUGH TO THE NEXT ROUND AND WITH SECONDS LEFT NO ONE KNEW THAT BETTER THAN THEIR CAPTAIN
YOU1000000110_S0000030	FOR MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS ME IF ONE MAN COULD WIN A FOOTBALL MATCH IT WOULD BE LITTLE MESSY
YOU1000000110_S0000031	MASS PRODUCED MAYBE HIS MOST SPECTACULAR INDIVIDUAL MOMENTS AT A WORLD CUP
YOU1000000110_S0000032	CLASSIC MESSAGE WE'VE SEEN HIM DO IT TIME AND TIME AGAIN
YOU1000000110_S0000033	MESSY AN UNBELIEVABLY TALENTED PLAYER LEADING HIS COUNTRY TO VICTORY
YOU1000000110_S0000034	PROPHECY THAT HAD BEEN MADE ABOUT A WONDER KID MANY YEARS AGO WAS NOW BEING FULFILLED
YOU1000000110_S0000036	WAS REALLY A YOUTH WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS WITH ARGENTINA WHEN HE BURST INTO PUBLIC CONSCIOUSNESS
YOU1000000110_S0000037	HE WAS THE ABSOLUTE STAR OF THAT TOURNAMENT HE ACTUALLY DIDN'T START THE TOURNAMENT IN THE TEAM
YOU1000000110_S0000038	IT WAS VERY EVIDENT THE KIND OF PLAYER HE WAS THE WAY THAT HE WAS AT TIMES HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE EVERYONE ELSE ON THE PIT
YOU1000000110_S0000039	SO MESSY AGAIN WAS BRILLIANTLY DONE WHAT A FANTASTIC IT WAS TOO MESSY
YOU1000000110_S0000040	SEMIFINAL AGAINST BRAZIL HE SCORED FROM OUTSIDE THE BOX EARLY ON A THUNDEROUS SHOT INTO THE TOP CORNER
YOU1000000110_S0000041	EXTRAORDINARY START BY ONE OF THE PLAYERS OF THE TOURNAMENT LIONEL MESSI
YOU1000000110_S0000042	THAT TOOK THEM INTO THE FINAL AND AGAIN MESSY WAS THE HERO IN THE FINAL HE SCORED BOTH GOALS IN A TWO ONE WIN OVER NIGERIA AND THEY WERE CHAMPIONS
YOU1000000110_S0000043	PENALTY SCORES
YOU1000000110_S0000044	THE STAR PLAYER HE WAS A PLAYER OF THE TOURNAMENT HE WAS THE LEADING SCORER
YOU1000000110_S0000046	ARGENTINA'S TROPHY IT'S A FIFTH WORLD CROWN
YOU1000000110_S0000047	TOURNAMENT THAT FEW WEEKS IN THE NETHERLANDS WHEN THE WORLD KNEW WE'VE GOT A SPECIAL PLAYER ON OUR HANDS
YOU1000000110_S0000048	WITHIN ARGENTINA THERE WAS QUITE A CLAMOR FOR HIM TO BE IN THE SQUAD FOR FOR TWO THOUSAND AND SIX THERE WAS A LOT OF INTEREST WHEN HE CAME OFF THE BENCH AGAINST SERBIA IN THE GROUP
YOU1000000110_S0000049	LIONEL MESSI BECOMES THE YOUNGEST ARGENTINE PLAYER TO PLAY AT A WORLD CUP SINCE NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR
YOU1000000110_S0000052	MESSY HE JUST HAD TO SCORE
YOU1000000110_S0000053	LIKE THAT WAS GOING TO BE THE PERFECT STATE TO THE WORLD CUP
YOU1000000110_S0000055	HERO OF ARGENTINA THE PLAYER THEY'VE CLAMORED FOR TO BE INCLUDED AS SCORE SIX
YOU1000000110_S0000056	IT DOESN'T HAVE A HAPPY ENDING IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX AND I COULD HAVE DONE BECAUSE THEY PLAYED GERMANY IN THE COURT FINALS THE GAME GOES TO PENALTIES AND LEO MESSI IS LEFT ON THE BENCH
YOU1000000110_S0000059	BECAUSE OF CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND HIS CONTROL HE WAS LEFT WATCHING FROM THE SIDELINES IN THE DECISIVE MOMENT IN HIS TEAM
YOU1000000110_S0000062	NEMESIS CAREER COULD HAVE BEEN VERY VERY DIFFERENT HAD HE PLAYED AGAINST GERMANY
YOU1000000110_S0000064	THOUGH ALREADY QUALIFIED TOPPING THE GROUP WOULD MEAN AN EASIER ROUTE TO THE FINAL AND A BETTER CHANCE AT LIFTING THE WORLD CUP
YOU1000000110_S0000065	IT WAS NIGERIA THEY NEEDED TO BEAT AND WITH HIS SIGHTS SET ON LIFTING THAT COVETED TROPHY SO BEGAN THE MESSY SHOW
YOU1000000110_S0000066	THE THIRD GROUP GAME WAS ON THE BACK OF MESSY HE SCORED THE OPENING GOAL VERY EARLY ON
YOU1000000110_S0000067	ONE ABSOLUTELY HAMMER IT INTO THE ROOM AND THERE'S NO STOPPING IT
YOU1000000110_S0000068	WHO WAS GONNA GET THE FIRST MESSY
YOU1000000110_S0000069	NIGERIA WEREN'T AN EASY TEAM TO PLAY GAMES HAD A LOT OF ATTACKING TALENT HIS SECOND GOAL AGAINST NIGERIA IS A STUNNING FREE KICK
YOU1000000110_S0000070	EXTRAORDINARY JUST EVERYTHING YOU WANT FROM A FREEING
YOU1000000110_S0000071	ARGENTINA CAME AWAY WITH THE THREE TO WIN ON THE BACK OF TWO MESSY GOALS
YOU1000000110_S0000072	HERE HE WAS HEADING INTO THE KNOCK OUT STAGES HAVING ARGENTINA ONE THREE OUT OF THREE LOOKING LIKE A TEAM THAT COULD GO ALL THE WAY
YOU1000000110_S0000074	AGAINST SWITZERLAND LABE CELESTE ONCE AGAIN STRUGGLED TO FIND A WAY THROUGH AGAINST A TOUGH OPPONENT
YOU1000000110_S0000075	GAME SEVEN OF THE ROUND OF SIXTEEN
YOU1000000110_S0000076	OPPOSITION TANGIBLY INTENT ON TRYING TO STOP MESSY HE WAS A MAN IN FORM AND A MAN INTENT ON TAKING ARGENTINA ALL THE WAY SWITZERLAND TOUGH OPPONENTS NOT MUCH IN THE GAME
YOU1000000110_S0000077	LOOKED LIKE IT WAS GOING TO GO TO PENALTIES
YOU1000000110_S0000078	THIS TIME MESS WOULD LEAVE IT RIGHT UP UNTIL THE HUNDRED AND EIGHTEENTH MINUTE BEFORE MAKING THE DIFFERENCE
YOU1000000110_S0000080	AND ARGENTINA HAVE PUNISHED THEM
YOU1000000110_S0000081	JUST BEFORE THE DREADED PENALTY SHOOTOUT ARGENTINA HAD FOUND THEIR WAY INTO THE LAST
YOU1000000110_S0000082	AND ARGENTINA NOW SURELY SAFELY THROUGH THE QUARTER FINALS
YOU1000000110_S0000083	AGAINST BELGIUM IT WOULD BE QUITE THE OPPOSITE WITH MESSY CAPITALIZING ON A MISTAKE IN THE FIRST FEW MINUTES
YOU1000000110_S0000084	THEY STARTED OFF SUPERBLY IN WITH THE GOAL
YOU1000000110_S0000085	ARGENTINA WERE ABLE TO SHOW THAT THEY HAD THIS COLLECTIVE STRUCTURE WHICH THEY'D BEEN LACKING IN THE PAST THAT IT WASN'T JUST A ONE MAN TEAM AND THAT IF THEY GOT AHEAD
YOU1000000110_S0000086	COULD DEFEND FOR THE REST OF THE GAME AND CLOSE OUT A GAME TO WIN IT ONE WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY DID
YOU1000000110_S0000087	INTO THE INSCORE AIN'T FINISHED THE GAME AND SO
YOU1000000110_S0000088	MESSES MEN HELD FIRM TO WIN THE MATCH HE HAD NOW DONE WHAT NO ARGENTINIAN CAPTAIN HAD MANAGED IN THE PAST TWENTY FOUR YEARS
YOU1000000110_S0000089	HAD LED HIS COUNTRY TO THE SEMIFINALS MESSY WAS FINALLY IN THE LAST FOUR
YOU1000000110_S0000090	ALTHOUGH IT HADN'T BEEN EASY THERE HAD BEEN MUCH PAIN ALONG THE WAY
YOU1000000110_S0000092	BY THE TIME THE NEXT WORLD CUP ROLLED AROUND IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN IN SOUTH AFRICA HE WAS THE BEST PLAYER IN THE WORLD
YOU1000000110_S0000093	IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE STORY WOULD MARADONNA BE ABLE TO LEAVE MESSY TO THE TITLE WHEN YOU LOOK BACK AT THE HIGHLIGHTS FROM NEARLY EVERY GAME MESS IS INVOLVED IN ALMOST EVERYTHING BUT HE DOESN'T SCORE
YOU1000000110_S0000095	ULTIMATELY WAS ABLE TO MAKE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE AGAINST GERMANY
YOU1000000110_S0000097	THE TEAM SYSTEM WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT IT NEVER LOOKED CONVINCING
YOU1000000110_S0000098	AGAIN GERMANY JUST AS IT HAD BEEN IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX WITH A TEAM THAT PUT THEM TO THE SWORD BUT THIS TIME IN A FAR MORE CONVINCING WAY
YOU1000000110_S0000099	FROM THE OPENING WHISTLE WE COULD SEE THERE WAS NO WAY THAT ANYTHING WAS GOING TO HAPPEN OTHER THAN THE GERMAN VICTORY
YOU1000000110_S0000100	AND THE QUEUING UP AGAIN HERE IT'S KIND OF PUT ON THE PLATE
YOU1000000110_S0000101	I THINK HE ENDS UP TAKING A LOT OF THE BLAME FOR ARGENTINA'S DISASTROUS PERFORMANCE
YOU1000000110_S0000102	DEEPLY FRUSTRATING FOR MESSY BECAUSE HE CAME AWAY FROM THAT TOURNAMENT KNOWING THAT HE HADN'T PLAYED PARTICULARLY WELL BUT ALSO KNOWING THAT HE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE THE CHANCE TO BECAUSE THE WAY THE TEAM WAS STRUCTURED JUST DIDN'T ALLOW IT
YOU1000000110_S0000103	WHAT WILL BE REGARDED AS A DAY OF DISASTER FOR ARGENTINA ARGENTINA KILL GERMANY FOR
YOU1000000110_S0000106	ARGENTINA THE LAST SOUTH AMERICAN STANDING IN BRAZIL WHICH OF THESE WILL MEET IT AT THE AMERICAN

YOU1000000110_S0000132	ARGENTINA ARE SET ON CAPTURING THE BIG ONE ON BRAZILIAN SOIL
YOU1000000110_S0000133	ONLY ONE TEAM STOOD BETWEEN ARGENTINA AND THE TROPHY AND IT WAS A FAMILIAR FOE
YOU1000000110_S0000134	YOU DON'T NEED MORE MOTIVATION WHEN YOU'RE IN A WORLD CUP FINAL WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET THEM BEAT US AGAIN
YOU1000000110_S0000135	YOU HAD THE FEELING THAT THIS IS THEIR YEAR THIS IS MISSED OPPORTUNITY
YOU1000000110_S0000136	MESSES ARGENTINA WOULD FACE GERMANY ONCE AGAIN
YOU1000000110_S0000139	GERMANY AND ARGENTINA PERHAPS PLANET FOOTBALL'S GREATEST INTERCONTINENTAL RIVALRY
YOU1000000110_S0000141	THERE ARE THREE KEY MOMENTS I REMEMBER REALLY IN THAT FINAL FROM MESSAGE POINTS OF VIEW ON WAS WHEN A MISTAKE BY GERMANY SENT GONZALO A CLEAN THROUGH MONGOLD
YOU1000000110_S0000142	THAT MOMENT WAS WAS SO CRUCIAL TO HIS CAREER YET IRONICALLY HE WASN'T DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN IT
YOU1000000110_S0000143	FIRST HALF SAW CHANCES ON BOTH SIDES
YOU1000000110_S0000144	LITTLE MESSY
YOU1000000110_S0000145	AND EARLY IN THE SECOND MESSY HAD HIS CHANCE
YOU1000000110_S0000146	RECEIVED THROUGH IN ONE OF HIS FAVORITE POSITIONS
YOU1000000110_S0000148	DIDN'T MISS IT BY MUCH BUT HE DID MISS IT AND THAT WILL BE A MOMENT THAT WILL HAUNT ME FOR THE REST OF HIS
YOU1000000110_S0000150	HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MINUTES GONE AND THESE SIDES STILL COULDN'T BE SEPARATED IT WAS A STALEMATE UNTIL
YOU1000000110_S0000153	GERMANY BY THIS STAGE HAD GOT THE GOAL TO GO AHEAD
YOU1000000110_S0000154	TAKEN WITH TOUCH WITH FINESSE
YOU1000000110_S0000155	GAME WASN'T OVER
YOU1000000110_S0000156	THE FINAL MOMENT REALLY OF THE MAX FINAL SIGNIFICANT MOMENT BASTION SCHEIDEGGER FOUL MESSY
YOU1000000110_S0000157	WAS A LONG WAY OUT HE WAS HERE IN A WORLD CUP FINAL WITH A CHANCE TO SAVE HIS TEAM
YOU1000000110_S0000158	THIS IS MESTA THIS IS THE MOMENT
YOU1000000110_S0000160	MESSY NO NO NO NO NO NO IT'S GONE AWAY IT'S GONE AWAY
YOU1000000110_S0000162	MOMENT WAS TOO MUCH FOR
YOU1000000110_S0000163	AND GERMANY GO ON AND WIN THE GAME MESSES ON THE LOSING SIDE
YOU1000000110_S0000164	THINK THAT MESSY FREE KICK IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN IS A MOMENT WHERE A LOT OF ARGENTINA FANS WILL FEEL THAT COULD HAVE BEEN THEIR CHANCE
YOU1000000110_S0000165	ARGENTINA'S WORLD CUP DREAM HIS DREAM HIS DREAM OF HIS LIFETIME WAS OVER
YOU1000000110_S0000166	GERMANY ARE THE CHAMPIONS OF THE WORLD
YOU1000000110_S0000167	IT WAS SO DEVASTATING WHEN THEY LOST IN THAT FINAL BECAUSE IT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO WATCH THE GREATEST PLAYER OF A GENERATION GO ON AND WIN THE WORLD CUP
YOU1000000110_S0000169	IT REALLY STARTED TO CHANGE THAT MANY OF PEOPLE'S IDEAS IN ARGENTINA ABOUT MESSY FOR THE NATIONAL TEAM
YOU1000000110_S0000170	
YOU1000000110_S0000174	IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THERE WAS SO MUCH EXPECTATION ON MESSY CAN TAKE THEM TO THE FINAL AND WIN IT THIS TIME
YOU1000000110_S0000175	THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN FOR ME WAS THE REALIZATION THAT MESSY CAN'T DO IT ALONE MESSY NEEDS MORE QUALITY AROUND
YOU1000000110_S0000177	WAS ONE OUTSTANDING MOMENT FOR MESSY IN THE TOURNAMENT HIS GOAL AGAINST NIGERIA HE MADE A RUN OFF THE SHOULDERS OF THE DEFENDER
YOU1000000110_S0000178	LIGHTED AND FLOATED AND TAKEN INTO HIS STRIDE BY LIONEL MESSI TO MAKE IT ONE
YOU1000000110_S0000179	CONTROL THE BALL ON HIS THIGH THEN TAKE A TOUCH WITH HIS LEFT FOOT THEN FINISH WITH HIS RIGHT WITHOUT BREAKING STRIDE
YOU1000000110_S0000181	IT'S HIS BUT IN THE END IT WASN'T ENOUGH BECAUSE ARGENTINA JUST WEREN'T GOOD ENOUGH THEY THEY NEVER LOOKED LIKE BEING GOOD ENOUGH
YOU1000000110_S0000182	RIGHT AT THE END OF THE GAME AGAINST FRANCE THEY FOUGHT BACK MESSY FLICKED OVER THE BALL FOR AGUERO TO HEAD
YOU1000000110_S0000183	AND ARGENTINA HAVE ANOTHER ONE HANG ON A MINUTE SESSION CUERO
YOU1000000110_S0000184	THEY HAD A LAST ATTACK AND THAT WAS THE FINAL CHANCE
YOU1000000110_S0000185	ARGENTINA VERY VERY EARLY BUT THE WHISTLE HAS GONE
YOU1000000110_S0000186	THE END OF THE DAY IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN WE JUST SAW LEO MESSI AND HE'S CUTTING A DESPONDENT FIGURE AND I THINK IT WAS A MOMENT WHEN YOU REALIZED THAT HE CAN'T DO IT
YOU1000000110_S0000187	THE MESSES OUT OF THE WORLD CUP AND ARGENTINA HAVE ONE
YOU1000000110_S0000188	WON EVERYTHING LA LA COPA DEL REY CHAMPIONS LEAGUE WORLD CLUB CUP BUT HE'S NOT WON THE WORLD CUP
YOU1000000110_S0000189	HE WANTS TO WIN THE WORLD CUP BECAUSE HE'S A WINNER BECAUSE HE'S A CHAMPION BECAUSE HE'S WON EVERYTHING ELSE BUT NOT TO PROVE ANYTHING
YOU1000000110_S0000190	AND HE KNOWS THAT THAT WILL DEFINE HIS LEGACY THERE'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER SHOT YOU'D IMAGINE IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO BUT IF IT WAS TO END TODAY
YOU1000000110_S0000191	WOULD LOOK BACK AND SAY IT'S DISAPPOINTING BECAUSE HE'S ARGUABLY THE BEST PLAYER OF ALL TIME
YOU1000000110_S0000192	AND THE ONE THING YOU WANT IN THE TROPHY CABINET OF THE BEST PLAYER OF ALL TIME IS A WORLD CUP
YOU1000000110_S0000193	HE WILL HAVE ONE LAST CHANCE
YOU1000000110_S0000194	CAN THEY DO THAT WITH MESSY AGE THIRTY FIVE
YOU1000000110_S0000195	BE JUST AN INCREDIBLE STORY AFTER SO MANY MISSES IN DIFFERENT FASHIONS IF IT'S THE LAST THING HE DOES IN FOOTBALL HE WILL WANT TO WIN THE WORLD CUP
YOU1000000111_S0000001	GAME SEVEN IS TIED WITH THREE AND A HALF TO GO HERE ON THE FOURTH
YOU1000000111_S0000003	GREEN BACK TO THOMPSON
YOU1000000111_S0000005	THOMPSON SPINS SHOOTS OVER IRVING CAN'T GET THE FALL AND KEVIN LOVE HIS THIRTEENTH REBOUND

YOU1000000115_S0000000	HOW THE ECONOMIC MACHINE WORKS IN THIRTY MINUTES
YOU1000000115_S0000002	THE ECONOMY WORKS LIKE A SIMPLE MACHINE BUT MANY PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND IT OR THEY DON'T AGREE ON HOW IT WORKS
YOU1000000115_S0000003	AND THIS HAS LED TO A LOT OF NEEDLESS ECONOMIC SUFFERING
YOU1000000115_S0000005	I FEEL A DEEP SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY TO SHARE MY SIMPLE BUT PRACTICAL ECONOMIC TEMPLATE
YOU1000000115_S0000007	THOUGH IT'S UNCONVENTIONAL
YOU1000000115_S0000009	HAS HELPED ME TO ANTICIPATE AND TO SIDESTEP THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS AND IT HAS WORKED WELL FOR ME FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS
YOU1000000115_S0000010	LET'S BEGIN THOUGH THE ECONOMY MIGHT SEEM COMPLEX IT WORKS IN A SIMPLE MECHANICAL WAY
YOU1000000115_S0000011	IT'S MADE UP OF A FEW SIMPLE PARTS AND A LOT OF SIMPLE TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE REPEATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN A MILLION TIMES
YOU1000000115_S0000012	THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE ABOVE ALL ELSE DRIVEN BY HUMAN NATURE AND THEY CREATE THREE MAIN FORCES THAT DRIVE THE ECONOMY
YOU1000000115_S0000013	NUMBER ONE PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH NUMBER TWO THE SHORT TERM DEBT CYCLE AND NUMBER THREE THE LONG TERM DEBT CYCLE
YOU1000000115_S0000014	WE'LL LOOK AT THESE THREE FORCES AND HOW LAYING THEM ON TOP OF EACH OTHER CREATES A GOOD TEMPLATE FOR TRACKING ECONOMIC MOVEMENTS AND FIGURING OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW
YOU1000000115_S0000015	LET'S START WITH THE SIMPLEST PART OF THE ECONOMY TRANSACTIONS
YOU1000000115_S0000017	AN ECONOMY IS SIMPLY THE SUM OF THE TRANSACTIONS THAT MAKE IT UP AND A TRANSACTION IS A VERY SIMPLE THING
YOU1000000115_S0000018	YOU MAKE TRANSACTIONS ALL THE TIME EVERY TIME YOU BUY SOMETHING YOU CREATE A TRANSACTION
YOU1000000115_S0000019	EACH TRANSACTION CONSISTS OF A BUYER EXCHANGING MONEY OR CREDIT WITH A SELLER FOR GOODS SERVICES OR FINANCIAL ASSETS
YOU1000000115_S0000020	CREDIT SPENDS JUST LIKE MONEY SO ADDING TOGETHER THE MONEY SPENT AND THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT SPENT YOU COULD KNOW THE TOTAL SPENDING
YOU1000000115_S0000021	THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF SPENDING DRIVES THE ECONOMY
YOU1000000115_S0000022	IF YOU DIVIDE THE AMOUNT SPENT BY THE QUANTITY SOLD YOU GET THE PRICE AND THAT'S IT THAT'S A TRANSACTION
YOU1000000115_S0000023	IT'S THE BUILDING BLOCK OF THE ECONOMIC MACHINE
YOU1000000115_S0000024	ALL CYCLES AND ALL FORCES IN AN ECONOMY ARE DRIVEN BY TRANSACTIONS SO IF WE CAN UNDERSTAND TRANSACTIONS WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE ECONOMY
YOU1000000115_S0000025	A MARKET CONSISTS OF ALL THE BUYERS AND ALL THE SELLERS MAKING TRANSACTIONS FOR THE SAME THING
YOU1000000115_S0000026	FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS A WHEAT MARKET A CAR MARKET STOCK MARKET AND MARKETS FOR MILLIONS OF THINGS
YOU1000000115_S0000027	AN ECONOMY CONSISTS OF ALL OF THE TRANSACTIONS IN ALL OF ITS MARKETS
YOU1000000115_S0000028	IF YOU ADD UP THE TOTAL SPENDING AND THE TOTAL QUANTITY SOLD IN ALL OF THE MARKETS YOU HAVE EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW TO UNDERSTAND THE ECONOMY
YOU1000000115_S0000029	IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE
YOU1000000115_S0000030	PEOPLE BUSINESSES BANKS AND GOVERNMENTS ALL ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS THE WAY I JUST DESCRIBED
YOU1000000115_S0000031	EXCHANGING MONEY AND CREDIT FOR GOODS SERVICES AND FINANCIAL ASSETS
YOU1000000115_S0000032	THE BIGGEST BUYER AND SELLER IS THE GOVERNMENT WHICH CONSISTS OF TWO IMPORTANT PARTS
YOU1000000115_S0000033	A CENTRAL GOVERNMENT THAT COLLECTS TAXES AND SPENDS MONEY AND A CENTRAL BANK WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER BUYERS AND SELLERS
YOU1000000115_S0000034	BECAUSE IT CONTROLS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY AND CREDIT IN THE ECONOMY
YOU1000000115_S0000035	IT DOES THIS BY INFLUENCING INTEREST RATES AND PRINTING NEW MONEY
YOU1000000115_S0000037	FOR THESE REASONS AS WE'LL SEE THE CENTRAL BANK IS AN IMPORTANT PLAYER IN THE FLOW OF CREDIT
YOU1000000115_S0000038	I WANT YOU TO PAY ATTENTION TO CREDIT
YOU1000000115_S0000039	CREDIT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE ECONOMY AND PROBABLY THE LEAST UNDERSTOOD
YOU1000000115_S0000040	IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT PART BECAUSE IT'S THE BIGGEST AND MOST VOLATILE PART
YOU1000000115_S0000042	JUST LIKE BUYERS AND SELLERS GO TO THE MARKET TO MAKE TRANSACTIONS SO DO LENDERS AND BORROWERS
YOU1000000115_S0000043	LENDERS USUALLY WANT TO MAKE THEIR MONEY INTO MORE MONEY AND BORROWERS USUALLY WANT TO BUY SOMETHING THEY CAN'T AFFORD
YOU1000000115_S0000044	LIKE A HOUSE OR A CAR OR THEY WANT TO INVEST IN SOMETHING LIKE STARTING A BUSINESS
YOU1000000115_S0000045	CREDIT CAN HELP BOTH LENDERS AND BORROWERS GET WHAT THEY WANT
YOU1000000115_S0000046	BORROWERS PROMISE TO REPAY THE AMOUNT THEY BORROW CALLED PRINCIPAL PLUS AN ADDITIONAL AMOUNT CALLED INTEREST
YOU1000000115_S0000047	WHEN INTEREST RATES ARE HIGH THERE IS LESS BORROWING BECAUSE IT'S EXPENSIVE
YOU1000000115_S0000048	WHEN INTEREST RATES ARE LOW BORROWING INCREASES BECAUSE IT'S CHEAPER
YOU1000000115_S0000050	WHEN BORROWERS PROMISE TO REPAY AND LENDERS BELIEVE THEM CREDIT IS CREATED
YOU1000000115_S0000052	ANY TWO PEOPLE CAN AGREE TO CREATE CREDIT OUT OF THIN AIR
YOU1000000115_S0000053	THAT SEEMS SIMPLE ENOUGH BUT CREDIT IS TRICKY BECAUSE IT HAS DIFFERENT NAMES
YOU1000000115_S0000054	AS SOON AS CREDIT IS CREATED IT IMMEDIATELY TURNS INTO DEBT
YOU1000000115_S0000055	DEBT IS BOTH AN ASSET TO THE LENDER AND A LIABILITY TO THE BORROWER
YOU1000000115_S0000057	IN THE FUTURE WHEN THE BORROWER REPAY THE LOAN PLUS INTEREST THE ASSET AND THE LIABILITY DISAPPEAR AND THE TRANSACTION IS SETTLED
YOU1000000115_S0000058	SO WHY IS CREDIT SO IMPORTANT
YOU1000000115_S0000060	BECAUSE WHEN A BORROWER RECEIVES CREDIT HE IS ABLE TO INCREASE HIS SPENDING AND REMEMBER SPENDING DRIVES THE ECONOMY
YOU1000000115_S0000061	THIS IS BECAUSE ONE PERSON SPENDING IS ANOTHER PERSON'S INCOME
YOU1000000115_S0000062	THINK ABOUT IT
YOU1000000115_S0000064	EVERY DOLLAR YOU SPEND SOMEONE ELSE EARNS AND EVERY DOLLAR YOU EARN SOMEONE ELSE HAS SPENT
YOU1000000115_S0000065	SO WHEN YOU SPEND MORE SOMEONE ELSE EARNS MORE
YOU1000000115_S0000066	WHEN SOMEONE'S INCOME RISES IT MAKES LENDERS MORE WILLING TO LEND HIM MONEY BECAUSE NOW HE'S MORE WORTHY OF CREDIT
YOU1000000115_S0000067	A CREDIT WORTHY BORROWER HAS TWO THINGS THE ABILITY TO REPAY AND COLLATERAL
YOU1000000115_S0000068	HAVING A LOT OF INCOME IN RELATION TO HIS DEBT GIVES HIM THE ABILITY TO REPAY
YOU1000000115_S0000070	IN THE EVENT THAT HE CAN'T REPAY HE HAS VALUABLE ASSETS TO USE AS COLLATERAL THAT CAN BE SOLD THIS MAKES LENDERS FEEL COMFORTABLE LENDING HIM MONEY
YOU1000000115_S0000071	SO INCREASED INCOME ALLOWS INCREASED BORROWING WHICH ALLOWS INCREASED SPENDING
YOU1000000115_S0000072	AND SINCE ONE PERSON'S SPENDING IS ANOTHER PERSON'S INCOME THIS LEADS TO MORE INCREASED BORROWING AND SO ON
YOU1000000115_S0000073	THIS SELF REINFORCING PATTERN LEADS TO ECONOMIC GROWTH AND IS WHY WE HAVE CYCLES
YOU1000000115_S0000075	IN A TRANSACTION YOU HAVE TO GIVE SOMETHING IN ORDER TO GET SOMETHING AND HOW MUCH YOU GET DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH YOU PRODUCE
YOU1000000115_S0000077	OVER TIME WE LEARN AND THAT ACCUMULATED KNOWLEDGE RAISES OUR LIVING STANDARDS WE CALL THIS PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH
YOU1000000115_S0000078	THOSE WHO ARE INVENTIVE AND HARD WORKING RAISE THEIR PRODUCTIVITY AND THEIR LIVING STANDARDS FASTER THAN THOSE WHO ARE COMPLACENT AND LAZY
YOU1000000115_S0000079	BUT THAT ISN'T NECESSARILY TRUE OVER THE SHORT RUN
YOU1000000115_S0000080	PRODUCTIVITY MATTERS MOST IN THE LONG RUN BUT CREDIT MATTERS MOST IN THE SHORT RUN
YOU1000000115_S0000081	THIS IS BECAUSE PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH DOESN'T FLUCTUATE MUCH SO IT'S NOT A BIG DRIVER OF ECONOMIC SWINGS
YOU1000000115_S0000082	DEBT IS BECAUSE IT ALLOWS US TO CONSUME MORE THAN WE PRODUCE WHEN WE ACQUIRE IT AND IT FORCES US TO CONSUME LESS THAN WE PRODUCE WHEN WE HAVE TO PAY IT BACK
YOU1000000115_S0000083	DEBT SWINGS OCCUR IN TWO BIG CYCLES ONE TAKES ABOUT FIVE TO EIGHT YEARS AND THE OTHER TAKES ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE TO A HUNDRED YEARS
YOU1000000115_S0000084	WHILE MOST PEOPLE FEEL THE SWINGS THEY TYPICALLY DON'T SEE THEM AS CYCLES BECAUSE THEY SEE THEM TOO UP CLOSE DAY BY DAY WEEK BY WEEK
YOU1000000115_S0000085	IN THIS CHAPTER WE'RE GOING TO STEP BACK AND LOOK AT THESE THREE BIG FORCES AND HOW THEY INTERACT TO MAKE UP OUR EXPERIENCES
YOU1000000115_S0000086	AS MENTIONED SWINGS AROUND THE LINE ARE NOT DUE TO HOW MUCH INNOVATION OR HARD WORK THERE IS THEY'RE PRIMARILY DUE TO HOW MUCH CREDIT THERE IS
YOU1000000115_S0000087	LET'S FOR A SECOND IMAGINE AN ECONOMY WITHOUT CREDIT IN THIS ECONOMY THE ONLY WAY I CAN INCREASE MY SPENDING IS TO INCREASE MY INCOME
YOU1000000115_S0000088	WHICH REQUIRES ME TO BE MORE PRODUCTIVE AND DO MORE WORK INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY IS THE ONLY WAY FOR GROWTH
YOU1000000115_S0000089	SINCE MY SPENDING IS ANOTHER PERSON'S INCOME THE ECONOMY GROWS EVERY TIME I OR ANYONE ELSE IS MORE PRODUCTIVE
YOU1000000115_S0000090	IF WE FOLLOW THE TRANSACTIONS AND PLAY THIS OUT WE SEE A PROGRESSION LIKE THE PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH LINE BUT BECAUSE WE BORROW WE HAVE CYCLES
YOU1000000115_S0000091	THIS ISN'T DUE TO ANY LAWS OR REGULATIONS IT'S DUE TO HUMAN NATURE AND THE WAY THE CREDIT WORKS
YOU1000000115_S0000092	THINK OF BORROWING AS SIMPLY A WAY OF PULLING SPENDING FORWARD IN ORDER TO BUY SOMETHING YOU CAN'T AFFORD YOU NEED TO SPEND MORE THAN YOU MAKE
YOU1000000115_S0000093	TO DO THIS YOU ESSENTIALLY NEED TO BORROW FROM YOUR FUTURE SELF IN DOING SO YOU CREATE A TIME IN THE FUTURE THAT YOU NEED TO SPEND LESS THAN YOU MAKE
YOU1000000115_S0000094	IN ORDER TO PAY IT BACK IT VERY QUICKLY RESEMBLES A CYCLE BASICALLY ANYTIME YOU BORROW YOU CREATE A CYCLE
YOU1000000115_S0000095	THIS IS AS TRUE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL AS IT IS FOR THE ECONOMY
YOU1000000115_S0000096	THIS IS WHY UNDERSTANDING CREDIT IS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT SETS INTO MOTION A MECHANICAL PREDICTABLE SERIES OF EVENTS THAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE
YOU1000000115_S0000097	THIS MAKES CREDIT DIFFERENT FOR MONEY MONEY IS WHAT YOU SETTLE TRANSACTIONS WITH
YOU1000000115_S0000098	WHEN YOU BUY A BEER FROM A BARTENDER WITH CASH THE TRANSACTION IS SETTLED IMMEDIATELY
YOU1000000115_S0000099	BUT WHEN YOU BUY A BEER WITH CREDIT IT'S LIKE STARTING A BAR TAB YOU'RE SAYING YOU PROMISE TO PAY IN THE FUTURE
YOU1000000115_S0000100	TOGETHER YOU AND THE BARTENDER CREATED AN ASSET AND A LIABILITY YOU JUST CREATED CREDIT OUT OF THIN AIR
YOU1000000115_S0000101	IT'S NOT UNTIL YOU PAY THE BAR TAB LATER THAT THE ASSET AND THE LIABILITY DISAPPEAR THE DEBT GOES AWAY AND THE TRANSACTION IS SETTLED
YOU1000000115_S0000103	THE REALITY IS THAT MOST OF WHAT PEOPLE CALL MONEY IS ACTUALLY CREDIT
YOU1000000115_S0000104	THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF CREDIT IN THE UNITED STATES IS ABOUT FIFTY TRILLION DOLLARS AND THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF MONEY IS ONLY ABOUT THREE TRILLION DOLLARS
YOU1000000115_S0000105	REMEMBER IN AN ECONOMY WITHOUT CREDIT THE ONLY WAY TO INCREASE YOUR SPENDING IS TO PRODUCE MORE
YOU1000000115_S0000106	BUT IN AN ECONOMY WITH CREDIT YOU CAN ALSO INCREASE YOUR SPENDING BY BORROWING
YOU1000000115_S0000107	AS A RESULT AN ECONOMY WITH CREDIT HAS MORE SPENDING AND ALLOWS INCOMES TO RISE FASTER THAN PRODUCTIVITY OVER THE SHORT RUN BUT NOT OVER THE LONG RUN
YOU1000000115_S0000108	DON'T GET ME WRONG CREDIT ISN'T NECESSARILY SOMETHING BAD THAT JUST CAUSES CYCLES
YOU1000000115_S0000109	IT'S BAD WHEN IT FINANCES OVERCONSUMPTION THAT CAN'T BE PAID BACK
YOU1000000115_S0000110	HOWEVER IT'S GOOD WHEN IT EFFICIENTLY ALLOCATE RESOURCES AND PRODUCES INCOME SO YOU CAN PAY BACK THE DEBT
YOU1000000115_S0000111	FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU BORROW MONEY TO BUY A BIG TV IT DOESN'T GENERATE INCOME FOR YOU TO PAY BACK THE DEBT
YOU1000000115_S0000112	BUT IF YOU BORROW MONEY TO SAY BUY A TRACTOR
YOU1000000115_S0000114	AND THAT TRACTOR LETS YOU HARVEST MORE CROPS AND EARN MORE MONEY THAN YOU CAN PAY BACK YOUR DEBT AND IMPROVE YOUR LIVING STANDARDS
YOU1000000115_S0000116	IN AN ECONOMY WITH CREDIT WE CAN FOLLOW THE TRANSACTIONS AND SEE HOW CREDIT CREATES GROWTH
YOU1000000115_S0000118	LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE SUPPOSE YOU EARN A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND HAVE NO DEBT YOU ARE CREDITWORTHY ENOUGH TO BORROW TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS
YOU1000000115_S0000119	SAY ON A CREDIT CARD SO YOU CAN SPEND A HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS EVEN THOUGH YOU ONLY EARN A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
YOU1000000115_S0000120	SINCE YOU'RE SPENDING IS ANOTHER PERSON'S INCOME SOMEONE IS EARNING A HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS
YOU1000000115_S0000121	THE PERSON EARNING A HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WITH NO DEBT CAN BORROW ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS SO HE CAN SPEND A HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS
YOU1000000115_S0000122	EVEN THOUGH HE HAS ONLY EARNED A HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS
YOU1000000115_S0000123	HIS SPENDING IS ANOTHER PERSON'S INCOME AND BY FOLLOWING THE TRANSACTIONS WE CAN BEGIN TO SEE HOW THIS PROCESS WORKS IN A SELF REINFORCING PATTERN
YOU1000000115_S0000124	BUT REMEMBER BORROWING CREATES CYCLES AND IF THE CYCLE GOES UP IT EVENTUALLY NEEDS TO COME DOWN
YOU1000000115_S0000125	THIS LEADS US INTO THE SHORT TERM DEBT CYCLE
YOU1000000115_S0000127	AS ECONOMIC ACTIVITY INCREASES WE SEE AN EXPANSION THE FIRST PHASE OF THE SHORT TERM DEBT CYCLE
YOU1000000115_S0000128	SPENDING CONTINUES TO INCREASE AND PRICES START TO RISE
YOU1000000115_S0000129	THIS HAPPENS BECAUSE THE INCREASE IN SPENDING IS FUELED BY CREDIT WHICH CAN BE CREATED INSTANTLY OUT OF THIN AIR
YOU1000000115_S0000130	WHEN THE AMOUNT OF SPENDING AND INCOMES GROW FASTER THAN THE PRODUCTION OF GOODS PRICES RISE
YOU1000000115_S0000131	WHEN PRICES RISE WE CALL THIS INFLATION THE CENTRAL BANK DOESN'T WANT TOO MUCH INFLATION BECAUSE IT CAUSES PROBLEMS
YOU1000000115_S0000132	SEEING PRICES RISE IT RAISES INTEREST RATES WITH HIGHER INTEREST RATES FEWER PEOPLE CAN AFFORD TO BORROW MONEY
YOU1000000115_S0000133	AND THE COST OF EXISTING DEBT RISES THINK ABOUT THIS AS THE MONTHLY PAYMENTS ON YOUR CREDIT CARD GOING UP
YOU1000000115_S0000135	BECAUSE PEOPLE BORROW LESS AND HAVE HIGHER DEBT REPAYMENTS THEY HAVE LESS MONEY LEFT OVER TO SPEND SO SPENDING SLOWS
YOU1000000115_S0000136	AND SINCE ONE PERSON'S SPENDING IS ANOTHER PERSON'S INCOME INCOME DROP AND SO ON AND SO FORTH
YOU1000000115_S0000137	WHEN PEOPLE SPEND LESS PRICES GO DOWN WE CALL THIS DEFLATION ECONOMIC ACTIVITY DECREASES
YOU1000000115_S0000138	AND WE HAVE A RECESSION IF THE RECESSION BECOMES TOO SEVERE AND INFLATION IS NO LONGER A PROBLEM
YOU1000000115_S0000139	THE CENTRAL BANK WILL LOWER INTEREST RATES TO CAUSE EVERYTHING TO PICK UP AGAIN
YOU1000000115_S0000140	WITH LOW INTEREST RATES DEBT REPAYMENTS ARE REDUCED AND BORROWING AND SPENDING PICK UP AND WE SEE ANOTHER EXPANSION
YOU1000000115_S0000141	AS YOU CAN SEE THE ECONOMY WORKS LIKE A MACHINE
YOU1000000115_S0000142	IN THE SHORT TERM DEBT CYCLE SPENDING IS CONSTRAINED ONLY BY THE WILLINGNESS OF LENDERS AND BORROWERS TO PROVIDE AND RECEIVE CREDIT
YOU1000000115_S0000143	WHEN CREDIT IS EASILY AVAILABLE THERE'S AN ECONOMIC EXPANSION WHEN CREDIT ISN'T EASILY AVAILABLE THERE'S A RECESSION
YOU1000000115_S0000144	AND NOTE THAT THIS CYCLE IS CONTROLLED PRIMARILY BY THE CENTRAL BANK
YOU1000000115_S0000145	THE SHORT TERM DEBT CYCLE TYPICALLY LASTS FIVE TO EIGHT YEARS AND HAPPENS OVER AND OVER AGAIN FOR DECADES
YOU1000000115_S0000146	BUT NOTICE THAT THE BOTTOM AND TOP OF EACH CYCLE FINISH WITH MORE GROWTH THAN THE PREVIOUS CYCLE AND WITH MORE DEBT
YOU1000000115_S0000147	WHY BECAUSE PEOPLE PUSH IT
YOU1000000115_S0000148	THEY HAVE AN INCLINATION TO BORROW AND SPEND MORE INSTEAD OF PAYING BACK DEBT IT'S HUMAN NATURE
YOU1000000115_S0000149	BECAUSE OF THIS OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME DEBTS RISE FASTER THAN INCOMES CREATING THE LONG TERM DEBT CYCLE
YOU1000000115_S0000151	DESPITE PEOPLE BECOMING MORE INDEBTED LENDERS EVEN MORE FREELY EXTEND CREDIT
YOU1000000115_S0000153	WHY
YOU1000000115_S0000155	BECAUSE EVERYONE THINKS THINGS ARE GOING GREAT PEOPLE ARE JUST FOCUSED ON WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING LATELY AND WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING LATELY
YOU1000000115_S0000157	INCOMES HAVE BEEN RISING ASSET VALUES ARE GOING UP THE STOCK MARKET ROARS IT'S A BOOM
YOU1000000115_S0000158	IT PAYS TO BUY GOODS SERVICES AND FINANCIAL ASSETS WITH BORROWED MONEY WHEN PEOPLE DO A LOT OF THAT WE CALL IT A BUBBLE
YOU1000000115_S0000159	SO EVEN THOUGH DEBTS HAVE BEEN GROWING INCOMES HAVE BEEN GROWING NEARLY AS FAST TO OFFSET THEM LET'S CALL THE RATIO OF DEBT TO INCOME THE DEBT BURDEN
YOU1000000115_S0000160	SO LONG AS INCOMES CONTINUE TO RISE THE DEBT BURDEN STAYS MANAGEABLE AT THE SAME TIME ASSET VALUES SORE
YOU1000000115_S0000161	PEOPLE BORROW HUGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY TO BUY ASSETS AS INVESTMENTS CAUSING THEIR PRICES TO RISE EVEN HIGHER
YOU1000000115_S0000162	PEOPLE FEEL WELL
YOU1000000115_S0000164	EVEN WITH THE ACCUMULATION OF LOTS OF DEBT RISING INCOMES AND ASSET VALUES HELP BORROWERS REMAIN CREDITWORTHY FOR A LONG TIME
YOU1000000115_S0000165	BUT THIS OBVIOUSLY CANNOT CONTINUE FOREVER AND IT DOESN'T
YOU1000000115_S0000166	OVER DECADES DEBT BURDENS SLOWLY INCREASED CREATING LARGER AND LARGER DEBT REPAYMENTS
YOU1000000115_S0000167	AT SOME POINT DEBT REPAYMENTS START GROWING FASTER THAN INCOMES FORCING PEOPLE TO CUT BACK ON THEIR SPENDING
YOU1000000115_S0000168	AND SINCE ONE PERSON'S SPENDING IS ANOTHER PERSON'S INCOME INCOMES BEGIN TO GO DOWN WHICH MAKES PEOPLE LESS CREDITWORTHY
YOU1000000115_S0000170	CAUSING BORROWING TO GO DOWN DEBT REPAYMENTS CONTINUE TO RISE WHICH MAKES SPENDING DROP EVEN FURTHER
YOU1000000115_S0000171	AND THE CYCLE REVERSES ITSELF
YOU1000000115_S0000173	THIS IS THE LONG TERM DEBT PEAK DEBT BURDENS HAVE SIMPLY BECOME TOO BIG
YOU1000000115_S0000175	THE UNITED STATES EUROPE AND MUCH OF THE REST OF THE WORLD THIS HAPPENED IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT
YOU1000000115_S0000176	IT HAPPENED FOR THE SAME REASON IT HAPPENED IN JAPAN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE AND IN THE UNITED STATES BACK IN NINETEEN TWENTY NINE
YOU1000000115_S0000177	NOW THE ECONOMY BEGINS DELEVERAGING
YOU1000000115_S0000179	IN LEVERAGING PEOPLE CUT SPENDING INCOMES FALL CREDIT DISAPPEARS ASSET PRICES DROP
YOU1000000115_S0000180	BANKS GET SQUEEZED THE STOCK MARKET CRASHES SOCIAL TENSIONS RISE AND THE WHOLE THING STARTS TO FEED ON ITSELF THE OTHER WAY
YOU1000000115_S0000182	AS INCOMES FALL AND DEBT REPAYMENTS RISE BORROWERS GET SQUEEZED NO LONGER CREDIT WORTHY
YOU1000000115_S0000183	CREDIT DRIES UP AND BORROWERS CAN NO LONGER BORROW ENOUGH MONEY TO MAKE THEIR DEBT REPAYMENTS
YOU1000000115_S0000184	SCRAMBLING TO FILL THIS HOLE BORROWERS ARE FORCED TO SELL ASSETS THE RUSH TO SELL ASSETS FLOODS THE MARKET AT THE SAME TIME AS SPENDING FALLS
YOU1000000115_S0000185	THIS IS WHEN THE STOCK MARKET COLLAPSE THE REAL ESTATE MARKET TANKS AND BANKS GET INTO TROUBLE
YOU1000000115_S0000186	AS ASSET PRICES DROP THE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL BORROWERS CAN PUT UP DROPS THIS MAKES BORROWERS EVEN LESS CREDITWORTHY
YOU1000000115_S0000187	PEOPLE FEEL POOR CREDIT RAPIDLY DISAPPEARS
YOU1000000115_S0000188	LESS SPENDING LESS INCOME LESS WEALTH LESS CREDIT LESS BORROWING AND SO ON IT'S A VICIOUS CYCLE
YOU1000000115_S0000189	THIS APPEARS SIMILAR TO A RECESSION BUT THE DIFFERENCE HERE IS THAT INTEREST RATES CAN'T BE LOWERED TO SAVE THE DAY
YOU1000000115_S0000190	IN A RECESSION LOWERING INTEREST RATES WORKS TO STIMULATE BORROWING
YOU1000000115_S0000191	HOWEVER IN LEVERAGING LOWERING INTEREST RATES DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE INTEREST RATES ARE ALREADY LOW AND SOON HIT ZERO PERCENT SO THE STIMULATION ENDS
YOU1000000115_S0000193	INTEREST RATES IN THE UNITED STATES HIT ZERO PERCENT DURING THE DELEVERAGING OF THE NINETEEN THIRTY S AND AGAIN IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT
YOU1000000115_S0000194	THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A RECESSION AND DELEVERAGING
YOU1000000115_S0000195	IS THAT IN DELEVERAGING BORROWERS DEBT BURDENS HAVE SIMPLY GOTTEN TOO BIG AND CAN'T BE RELIEVED BY LOWERING INTEREST RATES
YOU1000000115_S0000196	LENDERS REALIZE THAT DEBTS HAVE BECOME TOO LARGE TO EVER BE FULLY PAID BACK
YOU1000000115_S0000197	BORROWERS HAVE LOST THEIR ABILITY TO REPAY AND THEIR COLLATERAL HAS LOST VALUE
YOU1000000115_S0000198	THEY FEEL CRIPPLED BY THE DEBT THEY DON'T EVEN WANT MORE LENDERS STOP LENDING BORROWERS STOP BORROWING
YOU1000000115_S0000199	THINK OF THE ECONOMY AS BEING NOT CREDITWORTHY JUST LIKE AN INDIVIDUAL SO WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT IT DELEVERAGING
YOU1000000115_S0000200	THE PROBLEM IS DEBT BURDENS ARE TOO HIGH AND THEY MUST COME DOWN
YOU1000000115_S0000201	THERE ARE FOUR WAYS THIS CAN HAPPEN ONE PEOPLE BUSINESSES AND GOVERNMENTS CUT THEIR SPENDING
YOU1000000115_S0000202	TWO DEBTS ARE REDUCED THROUGH DEFAULTS AND RESTRUCTURINGS THREE WEALTH IS REDISTRIBUTED FROM THE HAVES TO THE HAVE NOTS
YOU1000000115_S0000203	AND FINALLY FOR THE CENTRAL BANK PRINTS NEW MONEY THESE FOUR WAYS HAVE HAPPENED IN EVERY DELEVERAGING IN MODERN HISTORY
YOU1000000115_S0000205	USUALLY SPENDING IS CUT FIRST AS WE JUST SAW PEOPLE BUSINESSES AND EVEN GOVERNMENTS TIGHTEN THEIR BELTS AND CUT THEIR SPENDING SO THAT THEY CAN PAY DOWN THEIR DEBT
YOU1000000115_S0000206	THIS IS OFTEN REFERRED TO AS AUSTERITY WHEN BORROWERS STOP TAKING ON NEW DEBTS AND START PAYING DOWN OLD DEBTS
YOU1000000115_S0000207	YOU MIGHT EXPECT THE DEBT BURDEN TO DECREASE BUT THE OPPOSITE HAPPENS BECAUSE SPENDING IS CUT
YOU1000000115_S0000208	AND ONE MAN'S SPENDING IS ANOTHER MAN'S INCOME IT CAUSES INCOMES TO FALL
YOU1000000115_S0000209	THEY FALL FASTER THAN DEBTS ARE REPAID AND THE DEBT BURDEN ACTUALLY GETS WORSE AS WE'VE SEEN THIS CUT IN SPENDING IS DEFLATIONARY AND PAINFUL
YOU1000000115_S0000210	BUSINESSES ARE FORCED TO CUT COSTS WHICH MEANS LESS JOBS AND HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT THIS LEADS TO THE NEXT STEP DEBTS MUST BE REDUCED
YOU1000000115_S0000211	MANY BORROWERS FIND THEMSELVES UNABLE TO REPAY THEIR LOANS AND A BORROWER'S DEBTS ARE LENDER'S ASSETS
YOU1000000115_S0000212	WHEN A BORROWER DOESN'T REPAY THE BANK PEOPLE GET NERVOUS THAT THE BANK WON'T BE ABLE TO REPAY THEM SO THEY RUSH TO WITHDRAW THEIR MONEY FROM THE BANK
YOU1000000115_S0000213	BANKS GET SQUEEZED AND PEOPLE BUSINESSES AND BANKS DEFAULT ON THEIR DEBTS
YOU1000000115_S0000214	THIS SEVERE ECONOMIC CONTRACTION IS A DEPRESSION
YOU1000000115_S0000215	A BIG PART OF A DEPRESSION IS PEOPLE DISCOVERING MUCH OF WHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS THEIR WEALTH ISN'T REALLY THERE
YOU1000000115_S0000216	LET'S GO BACK TO THE BAR WHEN YOU BOUGHT A BEER AND PUT IT ON A BAR TAB YOU PROMISE TO REPAY THE BARTENDER
YOU1000000115_S0000217	YOUR PROMISE BECAME AN ASSET OF THE BARTENDER
YOU1000000115_S0000218	BUT IF YOU BREAK YOUR PROMISE IF YOU DON'T PAY HIM BACK AND ESSENTIALLY DEFAULT ON YOUR BAR TAB THEN THE ASSET HE HAS ISN'T REALLY WORTH ANYTHING
YOU1000000115_S0000219	IT HAS BASICALLY DISAPPEARED
YOU1000000115_S0000221	MANY LENDERS DON'T WANT THEIR ASSETS TO DISAPPEAR AND AGREE TO DEBT RESTRUCTURING
YOU1000000115_S0000222	DEBT RESTRUCTURING MEANS LENDERS GET PAID BACK LESS OR GET PAID BACK OVER A LONGER TIME FRAME OR AT A LOWER INTEREST RATE THAN WAS FIRST AGREED
YOU1000000115_S0000223	SOMEHOW A CONTRACT IS BROKEN IN A WAY THAT REDUCES DEBT LENDERS WOULD RATHER HAVE A LITTLE OF SOMETHING THAN ALL OF NOTHING
YOU1000000115_S0000224	EVEN THOUGH DEBT DISAPPEARS DEBT RESTRUCTURING CAUSES INCOME AND ASSET VALUES TO DISAPPEAR FASTER SO THE DEBT BURDEN CONTINUES TO GET WORSE
YOU1000000115_S0000225	LIKE CUTTING SPENDING DEBT REDUCTION IS ALSO PAINFUL AND DEFLATIONARY
YOU1000000115_S0000227	ALL OF THIS IMPACTS THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE LOWER INCOMES AND LESS EMPLOYMENT MEANS THE GOVERNMENT COLLECTS FEWER TAXES
YOU1000000115_S0000228	AT THE SAME TIME IT NEEDS TO INCREASE ITS SPENDING BECAUSE UNEMPLOYMENT HAS RISEN
YOU1000000115_S0000229	MANY OF THE UNEMPLOYED HAVE INADEQUATE SAVINGS AND NEED FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM THE GOVERNMENT
YOU1000000115_S0000230	ADDITIONALLY GOVERNMENTS CREATE STIMULUS PLANS AND INCREASE THEIR SPENDING TO MAKE UP FOR THE DECREASE IN THE ECONOMY
YOU1000000115_S0000231	GOVERNMENT'S BUDGET DEFICITS EXPLODE IN LEVERAGING BECAUSE THEY SPEND MORE THAN THEY EARN IN TAXES
YOU1000000115_S0000232	THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING WHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT THE BUDGET DEFICIT ON THE NEWS
YOU1000000115_S0000234	TO FUND THEIR DEFICITS GOVERNMENTS NEED TO EITHER RAISE TAXES OR BORROW MONEY
YOU1000000115_S0000235	BUT WITH INCOMES FALLING AND SO MANY UNEMPLOYED WHO IS THE MONEY GOING TO COME FROM
YOU1000000115_S0000236	THE RICH SINCE GOVERNMENTS NEED MORE MONEY AND SINCE WEALTH IS HEAVILY CONCENTRATED IN THE HANDS OF A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE PEOPLE
YOU1000000115_S0000237	GOVERNMENTS NATURALLY RAISE TAXES ON THE WEALTHY WHICH FACILITATES A REDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH IN THE ECONOMY FROM THE HAVES TO THE HAVE NOTS
YOU1000000115_S0000238	THE HAVE NOTS WHO ARE SUFFERING BEGIN TO RESENT THE WEALTHY HAS
YOU1000000115_S0000239	THE WEALTHY HAVES BEING SQUEEZED BY THE WEAK ECONOMY FALLING ASSET PRICES AND HIGHER TAXES BEGIN TO RESENT THE HAVE NOTS
YOU1000000115_S0000240	IF THE DEPRESSION CONTINUES SOCIAL DISORDER CAN BREAK OUT
YOU1000000115_S0000241	NOT ONLY DO TENSIONS RISE WITHIN COUNTRIES THEY CAN RISE BETWEEN COUNTRIES ESPECIALLY DEBTORS AND CREDITORS COUNTRIES
YOU1000000115_S0000242	THIS SITUATION CAN LEAD TO POLITICAL CHANGE THAT CAN SOMETIMES BE EXTREME
YOU1000000115_S0000243	IN THE NINETEEN THIRTY S THIS LED TO HITLER COMING TO POWER WAR IN EUROPE AND DEPRESSION IN THE UNITED STATES
YOU1000000115_S0000244	PRESSURE TO DO SOMETHING TO END THE DEPRESSION INCREASES
YOU1000000115_S0000245	REMEMBER MOST OF WHAT PEOPLE THOUGHT WAS MONEY WAS ACTUALLY CREDIT SO WHEN CREDIT DISAPPEARS PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY
YOU1000000115_S0000246	PEOPLE ARE DESPERATE FOR MONEY AND YOU REMEMBER WHO CAN PRINT MONEY THE CENTRAL BANK CAN
YOU1000000115_S0000248	HAVING ALREADY LOWERED ITS INTEREST RATES TO NEARLY ZERO IT'S FORCED TO PRINT MONEY
YOU1000000115_S0000249	UNLIKE CUTTING SPENDING DEBT REDUCTION AND WEALTH REDISTRIBUTION PRINTING MONEY IS INFLATIONARY AND STIMULATIVE
YOU1000000115_S0000250	INEVITABLY THE CENTRAL BANK PRINTS NEW MONEY OUT OF THIN AIR AND USES IT TO BUY FINANCIAL ASSETS AND GOVERNMENT BONDS
YOU1000000115_S0000251	IT HAPPENED IN THE UNITED STATES DURING THE GREAT DEPRESSION
YOU1000000115_S0000252	AND AGAIN IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT WHEN THE UNITED STATES CENTRAL BANK THE FEDERAL RESERVE PRINTED OVER TWO TRILLION DOLLARS
YOU1000000115_S0000253	OTHER CENTRAL BANKS AROUND THE WORLD THAT COULD PRINTED A LOT OF MONEY TOO
YOU1000000115_S0000254	BY BUYING FINANCIAL ASSETS WITH THIS MONEY IT HELPS DRIVE UP ASSET PRICES WHICH MAKES PEOPLE MORE CREDIT WORTHY
YOU1000000115_S0000255	HOWEVER THIS ONLY HELPS THOSE WHO OWN FINANCIAL ASSETS YOU SEE THE CENTRAL BANK CAN PRINT MONEY BUT IT CAN ONLY BUY FINANCIAL ASSETS
YOU1000000115_S0000256	THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT ON THE OTHER HAND CAN BUY GOODS AND SERVICES AND PUT MONEY IN THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE BUT IT CAN'T PRINT MONEY
YOU1000000115_S0000257	SO IN ORDER TO STIMULATE THE ECONOMY THE TWO MUST COOPERATE
YOU1000000115_S0000258	BY BUYING GOVERNMENT BONDS THE CENTRAL BANK ESSENTIALLY LENDS MONEY TO THE GOVERNMENT ALLOWING IT TO RUN A DEFICIT AND INCREASED SPENDING
YOU1000000115_S0000259	ON GOODS AND SERVICES THROUGH ITS STIMULUS PROGRAMS AND UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS
YOU1000000115_S0000260	THIS INCREASES PEOPLE'S INCOME AS WELL AS THE GOVERNMENT'S DEBT HOWEVER IT WILL LOWER THE ECONOMY'S TOTAL DEBT BURDEN
YOU1000000115_S0000261	THIS IS A VERY RISKY TIME POLICYMAKERS NEED TO BALANCE THE FOUR WAYS THAT DEBT BURDENS COME DOWN
YOU1000000115_S0000263	THE DEFLATIONARY WAYS NEED TO BALANCE WITH THE INFLATIONARY WAYS IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN STABILITY
YOU1000000115_S0000264	IF BALANCED CORRECTLY THERE CAN BE A BEAUTIFUL DELIVER
YOU1000000115_S0000266	YOU SEE DELEVERAGING CAN BE UGLY OR IT CAN BE BEAUTIFUL HOW CAN A LEVERAGING BE BEAUTIFUL
YOU1000000115_S0000268	EVEN THOUGH DELEVERAGING IS A DIFFICULT SITUATION HANDLING A DIFFICULT SITUATION IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY IS BEAUTIFUL
YOU1000000115_S0000269	A LOT MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE DEBT FUELED UNBALANCED EXCESSES OF THE LEVERAGING PHASE
YOU1000000115_S0000270	IN A BEAUTIFUL DELEVERAGING DEBTS DECLINE RELATIVE TO INCOME REAL ECONOMIC GROWTH IS POSITIVE AND INFLATION ISN'T A PROBLEM
YOU1000000115_S0000271	IT IS ACHIEVED BY HAVING THE RIGHT BALANCE THE RIGHT BALANCE REQUIRES A CERTAIN MIX OF CUTTING SPENDING REDUCING DEBT
YOU1000000115_S0000273	TRANSFERRING WEALTH AND PRINTING MONEY SO THAT ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL STABILITY CAN BE MAINTAINED
YOU1000000115_S0000274	PEOPLE ASK IF PRINTING MONEY WILL RAISE INFLATION IT WON'T IF IT OFFSETS FALLING CREDIT
YOU1000000115_S0000275	REMEMBER SPENDING IS WHAT MATTERS A DOLLAR OF SPENDING PAID FOR WITH MONEY HAS THE SAME EFFECT ON PRICE AS A DOLLAR OF SPENDING PAID FOR WITH CREDIT
YOU1000000115_S0000277	BY PRINTING MONEY THE CENTRAL BANK CAN MAKE UP FOR THE DISAPPEARANCE OF CREDIT WITH AN INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY
YOU1000000115_S0000278	IN ORDER TO TURN THINGS AROUND THE CENTRAL BANK NEEDS TO NOT ONLY PUMP UP INCOME GROWTH
YOU1000000115_S0000279	BUT GET THE RATE OF INCOME GROWTH HIGHER THAN THE RATE OF INTEREST ON THE ACCUMULATED DEBT
YOU1000000115_S0000280	SO WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT BASICALLY INCOME NEEDS TO GROW FASTER THAN DEBT GROWS
YOU1000000115_S0000281	FOR EXAMPLE LET'S ASSUME THAT A COUNTRY GOING THROUGH DELEVERAGING HAS A DEBT TO INCOME RATIO OF A HUNDRED PERCENT
YOU1000000115_S0000282	THAT MEANS THAT THE AMOUNT OF DEBT IT HAS IS THE SAME AS THE AMOUNT OF INCOME THE ENTIRE COUNTRY MAKES IN A YEAR
YOU1000000115_S0000283	NOW THINK ABOUT THE INTEREST RATE ON THAT DEBT LET'S SAY IT'S TWO PERCENT
YOU1000000115_S0000284	IF DEBT IS GROWING AT TWO PERCENT BECAUSE OF THAT INTEREST RATE AND INCOME IS ONLY GROWING AT AROUND ONE PERCENT YOU WILL NEVER REDUCE THE DEBT BURDEN
YOU1000000115_S0000285	YOU NEED TO PRINT ENOUGH MONEY TO GET THE RATE OF INCOME GROWTH ABOVE THE RATE OF INTEREST
YOU1000000115_S0000286	HOWEVER PRINTING MONEY COULD EASILY BE ABUSED BECAUSE IT'S SO EASY TO DO AND PEOPLE PREFER IT TO THE ALTERNATIVES
YOU1000000115_S0000287	THE KEY IS TO AVOID PRINTING TOO MUCH MONEY AND CAUSING UNACCEPTABLY HIGH INFLATION THE WAY GERMANY DID DURING ITS DELEVERAGING IN THE NINETEEN TWENTY S
YOU1000000115_S0000288	IF POLICYMAKERS ACHIEVE THE RIGHT BALANCE DELEVERAGING ISN'T SO DRAMATIC GROWTH IS SLOW BUT DEBT BURDENS GO DOWN
YOU1000000115_S0000289	THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL DELEVERAGING WHEN INCOMES BEGIN TO RISE BORROWERS BEGIN TO APPEAR MORE CREDIT WORTHY
YOU1000000115_S0000290	AND WHEN BORROWERS APPEAR MORE CREDITWORTHY LENDERS BEGIN TO LEND MONEY AGAIN DEBT BURDENS FINALLY BEGIN TO FALL
YOU1000000115_S0000291	ABLE TO BORROW MONEY PEOPLE CAN SPEND MORE EVENTUALLY THE ECONOMY BEGINS TO GROW AGAIN LEADING TO THE REFLATION PHASE OF THE LONG TERM DEBT CYCLE
YOU1000000115_S0000292	THOUGH THE DELEVERAGING PROCESS CAN BE HORRIBLE IF HANDLED BADLY IF HANDLED WELL IT WILL EVENTUALLY FIX THE PROBLEM
YOU1000000115_S0000293	IT TAKES ROUGHLY A DECADE OR MORE FOR DEBT BURDENS TO FALL AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITY TO GET BACK TO NORMAL HENCE THE TERM LOST DECADE
YOU1000000115_S0000294	IN CLOSING OF COURSE THE ECONOMY IS A LITTLE BIT MORE COMPLICATED THAN THIS TEMPLATE SUGGESTS
YOU1000000115_S0000295	HOWEVER LAYING THE SHORT TERM DEBT CYCLE ON TOP OF THE LONG TERM DEBT CYCLE AND THEN LAYING BOTH OF THEM ON TOP OF THE PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH LINE
YOU1000000115_S0000296	GIVES A REASONABLY GOOD TEMPLATE FOR SEEING WHERE WE'VE BEEN WHERE WE ARE NOW AND WHERE WE'RE PROBABLY HEADED
YOU1000000115_S0000297	SO IN SUMMARY THERE ARE THREE RULES OF THUMB THAT I'D LIKE YOU TO TAKE AWAY FROM THIS
YOU1000000115_S0000298	FIRST DON'T HAVE DEBT RISE FASTER THAN INCOME BECAUSE YOUR DEBT BURDENS WILL EVENTUALLY CRUSH YOU
YOU1000000115_S0000299	SECOND DON'T HAVE INCOME RISE FASTER THAN PRODUCTIVITY BECAUSE YOU'LL EVENTUALLY BECOME UNCOMPETITIVE
YOU1000000115_S0000300	AND THIRD DO ALL THAT YOU CAN TO RAISE YOUR PRODUCTIVITY BECAUSE IN THE LONG RUN THAT'S WHAT MATTERS MOST
YOU1000000115_S0000301	THIS IS SIMPLE ADVICE FOR YOU AND IT'S SIMPLE ADVICE FOR POLICYMAKERS
YOU1000000115_S0000302	YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED BUT MOST PEOPLE INCLUDING MOST POLICYMAKERS DON'T PAY ENOUGH ATTENTION TO THIS
YOU1000000115_S0000303	THIS TEMPLATE HAS WORKED FOR ME AND I HOPE IT WILL WORK FOR YOU THANK YOU
YOU1000000116_S0000000	AS WE BEGIN OUR JOURNEY INTO THE WORLD OF ECONOMICS I THOUGHT I WOULD BEGIN WITH A QUOTE FROM ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS ECONOMISTS OF ALL TIME
YOU1000000116_S0000001	THE SCOTTISH PHILOSOPHER ADAM SMITH AND HE REALLY IS KIND OF THE FIRST REAL ECONOMIST IN THE WAY THAT WE VIEW IT NOW AND THIS IS FROM HIS
YOU1000000116_S0000002	THE WEALTH OF NATIONS PUBLISHED IN SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SIX COINCIDENTALLY THE SAME YEAR AS THE AMERICAN DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE
YOU1000000116_S0000003	AND IT'S ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS EXCERPTS HE GENERALLY INDEED HE BEING AN ECONOMIC ACTOR NEITHER INTENDS TO PROMOTE THE PUBLIC INTEREST NOR KNOWS HOW MUCH HE IS PROMOTING IT
YOU1000000116_S0000004	BY DIRECTING THAT INDUSTRY SO THE INDUSTRY IN CONTROL OF THAT INDIVIDUAL ACTOR IN SUCH A MANNER AS ITS PRODUCE MAY BE OF THE GREATEST VALUE HE INTENDS ONLY HIS OWN GAIN
YOU1000000116_S0000005	HE INTENDS ONLY HIS OWN GAIN AND HE IS IN THIS AS IN MANY OTHER CASES LED BY AN INVISIBLE HAND TO PROMOTE AN END
YOU1000000116_S0000006	WHICH WAS NO PART OF HIS INTENTION AND THIS TERM INVISIBLE HAND IS FAMOUS LED BY AN INVISIBLE HAND TO PROMOTE AN END
YOU1000000116_S0000007	WHICH WAS NO PART OF HIS INTENTION HE'S SAYING LOOK WHEN INDIVIDUAL ACTORS JUST ACT IN THEIR OWN SELF INTEREST THAT OFTEN AN AGGREGATE LEADS TO THINGS THAT EACH OF THOSE INDIVIDUAL ACTORS DID NOT INTEND
YOU1000000116_S0000008	AND THEN HE SAYS NOR IS IT ALWAYS THE WORSE FOR SOCIETY THAT IT WAS NO PART OF IT SO IT'S NOT ALWAYS NECESSARILY A BAD THING BY PURSUING HIS OWN INTEREST
YOU1000000116_S0000009	HE FREQUENTLY PROMOTES THAT OF THE SOCIETY MORE EFFECTUALLY THAN WHEN HE REALLY INTENDS TO PROMOTE IT SO THIS IS A PRETTY STRONG STATEMENT
YOU1000000116_S0000010	REALLY AT THE CORE OF CAPITALISM AND THAT'S WHY I POINT OUT THAT IT WAS PUBLISHED THE SAME YEAR THE AMERICAN DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY
YOU1000000116_S0000011	AMERICA THE FOUNDING FATHERS THEY WROTE THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE THE CONSTITUTION IT REALLY TALKS ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY WHAT ARE THE RIGHTS OF ITS CITIZENS
YOU1000000116_S0000012	BUT THE UNITED STATES IN ITS OVERALL THE OVERALL EXPERIENCE OF AN AMERICAN IS AT LEAST AS INFLUENCED BY THE WORK OF ADAM SMITH
YOU1000000116_S0000013	BY THESE KIND OF FOUNDATIONAL IDEAS OF CAPITALISM AND THEY JUST BOTH HAPPENED TO HAPPEN AROUND THE SAME TIME
YOU1000000116_S0000014	BUT THIS IDEA IT'S NOT ALWAYS THAT INTUITIVE INDIVIDUAL ACTORS BY BY ESSENTIALLY PURSUING THEIR OWN SELF INTERESTED ENDS MIGHT BE DOING MORE FOR SOCIETY
YOU1000000116_S0000015	THEN WHEN THE THEN IF ANY OF THEM ACTUALLY TRY TO PROMOTE THE OVERALL WELL BEING OF SOCIETY AND I DON'T THINK ADAM SMITH WOULD SAY THAT IT'S ALWAYS GOOD
YOU1000000116_S0000016	SOMEONE TO ACT SELF INTERESTED OR THAT IT'S NEVER GOOD FOR PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY THINK ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN AN AGGREGATE SENSE BUT HE'S SAYING THAT FREQUENTLY
YOU1000000116_S0000017	FREQUENTLY THE SELF INTERESTED ACTION COULD LEAD TO THE GREATER GOOD COULD LEAD TO MORE INNOVATION COULD LEAD TO BETTER INVESTMENT
YOU1000000116_S0000018	COULD LEAD TO MORE PRODUCTIVITY COULD LEAD TO MORE WEALTH MORE MORE A LARGER PIE FOR EVERYONE
YOU1000000116_S0000019	AND NOW ECONOMICS IS FREQUENTLY AND WHEN HE MAKES A STATEMENT HE'S ACTUALLY MAKING A MIX OF A MICROECONOMIC AND MACROECONOMIC STATEMENT
YOU1000000116_S0000020	MICRO IS THAT PEOPLE INDIVIDUAL ACTORS ARE ACTING IN THEIR OWN SELF INTEREST AND THE MACRO IS THAT IT MIGHT BE GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY OR FOR THE NATION AS A WHOLE
YOU1000000116_S0000021	AND SO NOW MODERN ECONOMISTS TEND TO DIVIDE THEMSELVES INTO THESE TWO SCHOOLS OR INTO THESE TWO SUBJECTS MICROECONOMICS
YOU1000000116_S0000023	MICROECONOMICS WHICH IS THE STUDY OF INDIVIDUAL ACTORS MICROECONOMICS AND THOSE ACTORS COULD BE FIRMS IT COULD BE PEOPLE IT COULD BE HOUSEHOLDS
YOU1000000116_S0000024	AND YOU HAVE MACROECONOMICS WHICH IS THE STUDY OF THE ECONOMY IN AGGREGATE MACRO
YOU1000000116_S0000026	ECONOMICS AND YOU GET IT FROM THEIR WORDS
YOU1000000116_S0000027	MICRO THE PREFIX REFERS TO VERY SMALL THINGS MACRO REFERS TO THE LARGER THE BIGGER PICTURE AND SO MICROECONOMICS JUST TO RESTATE IT IS IS ESSENTIALLY
YOU1000000116_S0000028	ACTORS ACTORS MAKE DECISIONS MAKE DECISIONS OR I GUESS WE COULD SAY ALLOCATIONS ALLOCATIONS DECISIONS SLASH
YOU1000000116_S0000029	ALLOCATIONS ALLOCATIONS OF SCARCE RESOURCES AND YOU'RE GONNA HEAR THE WORD SCARCE RESOURCES A LOT WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT ECONOMICS
YOU1000000116_S0000030	AND A SCARCE RESOURCE IS ONE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE AN INFINITE AMOUNT OF FOR EXAMPLE LOVE MIGHT NOT BE A SCARCE RESOURCE YOU MIGHT HAVE AN INFINITE AMOUNT OF LOVE
YOU1000000116_S0000031	BUT A RESOURCE THAT WOULD BE SCARCE IS SOMETHING LIKE FOOD OR WATER OR MONEY OR TIME OR LABOR THESE ARE ALL SCARCE RESOURCES
YOU1000000116_S0000032	SO MACROECONOMICS IS WELL HOW DO PEOPLE DECIDE WHERE TO PUT THOSE SCARCE RESOURCES HOW DO THEY DECIDE WHERE TO DEPLOY THEM AND HOW DOES THAT HOW DOES THAT AFFECT PRICES AND MARKETS AND WHATEVER ELSE
YOU1000000116_S0000033	MACROECONOMICS IS A STUDY OF OF WHAT HAPPENS IN AGGREGATE TO AN ECONOMY SO AGGREGATE WHAT HAPPENS IN AGGREGATE
YOU1000000116_S0000034	TO AN ECONOMY FROM THE MILLIONS OF INDIVIDUAL ACTORS AGGREGATE AGGREGATE ECONOMY WE HAVE NOW HAVE MILLIONS
YOU1000000116_S0000035	MILLIONS OF ACTORS AND IT OFTEN FOCUSES ON POLICY RELATED QUESTIONS SO DO YOU RAISE OR LOWER TAXES OR WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN YOU RAISE OR LOWER TAXES
YOU1000000116_S0000036	DO YOU REGULATE OR DEREGULATE HOW DOES THAT AFFECT THE OVERALL PRODUCTIVITY WHEN YOU DO THESE SO IT'S POLICY
YOU1000000116_S0000037	TOP TOP DOWN TOP DOWN QUESTIONS AND IN BOTH MACRO AND MICRO ECONOMICS THERE'S A THERE ESPECIALLY IN THE MODERN SENSE OF IT
YOU1000000116_S0000039	THERE'S AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE THEM RIGOROUS TO MAKE THEM MATHEMATICAL SO IN EITHER CASE YOU CAN START WITH SOME OF THE IDEAS SOME OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS OR THE LOGICAL IDEAS
YOU1000000116_S0000040	THAT SAY SOMEONE LIKE AN ADAM SMITH MIGHT HAVE SO YOU HAVE KIND OF YOU HAVE THESE AND THERE ARE BASIC IDEAS ABOUT ABOUT HOW PEOPLE THINK HOW PEOPLE MAKE DECISIONS
YOU1000000116_S0000041	SO PHILOSOPHY PHILOSOPHY OF OF PEOPLE OF DECISION MAKING IN THE CASE OF IN THE CASE OF MICROECONOMICS DECISION MAKING
YOU1000000116_S0000042	AND THEN YOU MAKE SOME ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT IT OR YOU SIMPLIFY IT SO I'LL DO RIGHT THIS YOU SIMPLIFY IT
YOU1000000116_S0000043	AND YOU REALLY ARE SIMPLIFYING YOU SAY OH ALL PEOPLE ARE RATIONAL OR ALL PEOPLE ARE GOING TO ACT IN THEIR OWN SELF INTEREST OR ALL PEOPLE ARE GOING TO MAXIMIZE THEIR GAIN WHICH ISN'T TRUE
YOU1000000116_S0000044	HUMAN BEINGS ARE MOTIVATED BY A WHOLE BUNCH OF THINGS BUT YOU SIMPLIFY THESE THINGS SO THAT YOU CAN START TO DEAL WITH IT IN KIND OF A MATHEMATICAL WAY
YOU1000000116_S0000045	SO YOU SIMPLIFY IT SO YOU CAN START DEALING WITH IT IN A MATHEMATICAL SENSE THIS IS VALUABLE IT CAN CLARIFY YOUR THINKING IT CAN ALLOW YOU TO PROVE THINGS
YOU1000000116_S0000046	BASED ON YOUR ASSUMPTIONS AND SO AND YOU CAN START TO VISUALIZE THINGS MATHEMATICALLY WITH CHARTS AND GRAPHS AND THINK ABOUT WHAT WILL ACTUALLY HAPPEN WITH MARKET
YOU1000000116_S0000047	IT'S VERY VERY VALUABLE TO HAVE THIS MATHEMATICAL RIGOROUS THINKING BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT CAN BE A LITTLE BIT DANGEROUS BECAUSE YOU'RE MAKING THIS HUGE SIMPLIFICATION
YOU1000000116_S0000048	SOMETIMES THE MATH MIGHT LEAD YOU TO SOME VERY STRONG CONCLUSIONS CONCLUSIONS WHICH YOU MIGHT FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE YOU PROVE YOU'VE PROVEN
YOU1000000116_S0000049	THE SAME WAY THAT YOU MIGHT PROVE RELATIVITY BUT THEY WERE BASED ON SOME SOME ASSUMPTIONS THAT EITHER MIGHT BE WRONG OR MIGHT BE OVERSIMPLIFICATIONS OR MIGHT NOT BE RELEVANT
YOU1000000116_S0000050	TO THE CONTEXT THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE CONCLUSIONS ABOUT SO IT'S VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO TAKE IT ALL WITH A GRAIN OF SALT TO REMEMBER THAT IT'S ALL BASED ON SOME SIMPLIFYING ASSUMPTIONS
YOU1000000116_S0000051	AND MACROECONOMICS IS PROBABLY EVEN MORE GUILTY OF IT IN MICROECONOMICS YOU'RE TAKING THESE DEEPLY COMPLICATED THINGS THE HUMAN BRAIN HOW PEOPLE ACT AND RESPOND TO EACH OTHER
YOU1000000116_S0000052	AND AND THEN YOU'RE AGGREGATING IT OVER MILLIONS OF PEOPLE SO IT'S ULTRA COMPLICATED YOU HAVE MILLIONS OF THESE INFINITELY COMPLICATED PEOPLE ALL INTERACTING WITH EACH OTHER SO
YOU1000000116_S0000053	IT'S VERY COMPLICATED MANY MILLIONS OF INTERACTIONS AND FUNDAMENTALLY UNPREDICTABLE INTERACTIONS AND THEN TRYING TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ON THOSE
YOU1000000116_S0000054	TRYING TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS AND THEN DOING AND THEN DOING MATH WITH THAT THAT COULD LEAD YOU TO SOME CONCLUSIONS OR MIGHT LEAD YOU TO SOME PREDICTIONS
YOU1000000116_S0000055	ONCE AGAIN IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THIS IS VALUABLE IT'S VALUABLE TO MAKE THESE MATHEMATICAL MODELS TO MAKE THESE MATHEMATICAL ASSUMPTIONS THESE MATHEMATICAL CONCLUSIONS
YOU1000000116_S0000056	BUT IT ALWAYS NEEDS TO BE TAKEN WITH A GRAIN OF SALT AND SO THAT YOU HAVE A PROPER GRAIN OF SALT AND SO THAT YOU ARE ALWAYS FOCUSED ON THE TRUE INTUITION
YOU1000000116_S0000057	AND THAT'S REALLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO GET FROM A COURSE ON OF ECONOMICS THAT YOU CAN TRULY REASON THROUGH WHAT'S LIKELY TO HAPPEN MAYBE EVEN WITHOUT THE MATHEMATICS
YOU1000000116_S0000058	I'LL LEAVE YOU WITH TWO QUOTES AND THESE QUOTES ARE A LITTLE BIT THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT FUNNY BUT THEY REALLY I THINK ARE HELPFUL THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND AS YOU START TO ESPECIALLY GO DEEP INTO THE MATHEMATICAL SIDE
YOU1000000116_S0000059	OF ECONOMICS SO THIS RIGHT OVER HERE IS A QUOTE BY ALFRED NOT WHO IS A PUBLISHER IN IN THE NINETEEN HUNDREDS
YOU1000000116_S0000060	AN ECONOMIST IS A MAN WHO STATES THE OBVIOUS IN TERMS OF THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE AND I'M ASSUMING WHEN HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE HE'S REFERRING TO SOME OF THE MATH STUFF THAT YOU SEE
YOU1000000116_S0000061	IN ECONOMICS AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL MAKE THIS AS COMPREHENSIBLE AS AS POSSIBLE AND SEE THAT THERE IS VALUE IN THIS BUT IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT STATEMENT HE'S MAKING
YOU1000000116_S0000062	OFTENTIMES IT'S STATING A COMMON SENSE THING IT'S STATING SOMETHING THAT'S OBVIOUS IT'S OBVIOUS AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ALWAYS KEEP THAT IN MIND
YOU1000000116_S0000063	ALWAYS MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE INTUITION FOR WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE MATH OR TO KNOW WHEN THE MATH IS GOING IN A DIRECTION THAT MIGHT BE STRANGE BASED ON OVERSIMPLIFICATION
YOU1000000116_S0000064	WRONG ASSUMPTIONS AND THEN YOU HAVE THIS QUOTE OVER HERE BY LAWRENCE J PETER MOST FAMOUS FOR PETER'S PRINCIPLES PROFESSOR AT USC
YOU1000000116_S0000065	AN ECONOMIST IS AN EXPERT WHO WILL KNOW TOMORROW WHY THE THINGS HE PREDICTED YESTERDAY DIDN'T HAPPEN TODAY AND ONCE AGAIN IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN THE BACK OF ONE'S MIND
YOU1000000116_S0000066	BECAUSE ESPECIALLY AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY RELEVANT TO MACROECONOMICS BECAUSE IN MACROECONOMICS THERE'S ALL SORTS OF PREDICTIONS ABOUT THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY
YOU1000000116_S0000067	NEEDS TO BE DONE HOW LONG WILL THE RECESSION LAST WHAT WILL BE THE ECONOMIC GROWTH NEXT YEAR WHAT WILL INFLATION DO AND THEY OFTEN PROVE TO BE WRONG
YOU1000000116_S0000068	FACT FEW ECONOMISTS EVEN TEND TO AGREE ON MANY OF THESE THINGS AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT BECAUSE OFTENTIMES WHEN YOU'RE DEEP IN THE MATHEMATICS OF THE ECONOMICS IT MIGHT SEEM
YOU1000000116_S0000069	TO BE A SCIENCE LIKE PHYSICS BUT IT'S NOT A SCIENCE LIKE PHYSICS THERE'S OPEN IT IS OPEN TO SUBJECTIVITY
YOU1000000116_S0000070	A LOT OF THAT SUBJECTIVITY IS ALL AROUND IS ALL AROUND THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT YOU CHOOSE TO MAKE
YOU1000000117_S0000000	ALRIGHT I THINK WE'RE AT TIME SO LET'S GET STARTED WELCOME TO FOLKS I DON'T KNOW I'M DR LAURIE SANTOS A PROFESSOR HERE AT YALE UNIVERSITY
YOU1000000117_S0000001	AND THE TEACHER OF THE SCIENCE OF WELLBEING COURSE ON COURSERA DOT ORG AND THE HOST OF THE HAPPINESS LAB PODCAST
YOU1000000117_S0000002	WE WANTED TO DO THIS FACEBOOK LIVE EVENT TODAY BECAUSE I KNOW ALL OF YOU ARE STRUGGLING WITH COVID NINETEEN
YOU1000000117_S0000003	AND ALL THE ANXIETIES AND THE UNCERTAINTIES THAT COME WITH IT WE KNOW OF COURSE ALL THE PHYSICAL THINGS WE NEED TO DO TO PROTECT OUR PHYSICAL HEALTH RIGHT WE SHOULD BE WASHING OUR HANDS AND SOCIALLY DISTANCING AND SO ON
YOU1000000117_S0000004	BUT I THINK A LOT OF US ARE STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW WITH THE KINDS OF THINGS WE SHOULD BE DOING TO PROTECT OUR MENTAL HEALTH
YOU1000000117_S0000005	AND WE NEED TO BE JUST AS INTENTIONAL ABOUT PROTECTING OUR OWN ANXIETIES AND DEPRESSIONS AND SORT OF FIXING THAT AS WE ARE PROTECTING OUR PHYSICAL HEALTH
YOU1000000117_S0000006	AND THIS CALL TODAY IS TO ANSWER ALL YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT SCIENCE SUGGESTS THAT WE CAN DO TO PROMOTE OUR MENTAL HEALTH IN THIS CHALLENGING TIME
YOU1000000117_S0000007	WHAT I'M GONNA BE DOING IS ANSWERING ALL OF YOUR QUESTIONS SO PLEASE BE SENDING THEM IN ON THE SIDE
YOU1000000117_S0000008	IF YOU HAVEN'T YET SENT US AN EMOJI TO LET US KNOW YOU'RE THERE PLEASE LET US KNOW
YOU1000000117_S0000009	AND I THINK SINCE WE HAVE SUCH A SHORT TIME I THINK WE'RE JUST GOING TO JUMP RIGHT INTO IT
YOU1000000117_S0000010	YOU'LL SEE ME KIND OF LOOKING OVER AT THE SIDE ON MY CHAT SCREEN TO SEE WHAT THE QUESTIONS ARE
YOU1000000117_S0000011	AND THE FIRST QUESTION WE HAVE TODAY IS FROM ELIZABETH WHO ASKS DO YOU HAVE ANY ADVICE ON DEALING WITH OR REDUCING TENSION AND ARGUING IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP DURING THESE STAY AT HOME ORDERS
YOU1000000117_S0000012	THIS ONE'S A BIG ONE I THINK YOU'RE SPEAKING TO ME I THINK A LOT OF US ARE FACING THE CHALLENGE RIGHT NOW
YOU1000000117_S0000013	WE'RE SPENDING MORE TIME WITH OUR SPOUSES WITH OUR PARTNERS WITH OUR KIDS
YOU1000000117_S0000014	AND THAT CAN BE INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING NORMALLY BUT IT'S ESPECIALLY CHALLENGING IN AN OTHERWISE ANXIETY PROVOKING TIME
YOU1000000117_S0000015	AND SO I THINK THE FIRST PIECE OF ADVICE I HAVE IS TO JUST VALIDATE THAT LIKE YEAH THIS IS A BIG THING THAT WE'RE ALL STRUGGLING WITH
YOU1000000117_S0000016	BUT THEN TO SORT OF ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO BE A LITTLE BIT PATIENT
YOU1000000117_S0000017	THE RESEARCH ON RELATIONSHIPS AND WHAT ALLOWS RELATIONSHIPS TO SUCCEED FOLKS LIKE PROFESSOR ELI FINKEL AND OTHERS
YOU1000000117_S0000018	THEY REALLY SUGGEST THAT A LOT OF OUR RELATIONSHIP SUCCESS HAS TO DO WITH OUR EXPECTATIONS
YOU1000000117_S0000019	AND I THINK IF ANYTHING WE MIGHT WANT TO JUST BE A LITTLE CHILLER ABOUT OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR OUR SPOUSES THAN WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN BEFORE
YOU1000000117_S0000020	ALL OF US ARE GOING THROUGH THIS STRUGGLING TIME AND SO IF YOU HAVE A SPOUSE WHO SAY YOU KNOW DIDN'T EMPTY THE DISHWASHER OR ISN'T DOING THEIR PART AS MUCH WITH KIDS
YOU1000000117_S0000021	I THINK THIS IS A TIME TO BE COMPASSIONATE BOTH WITH THEM AND WITH YOURSELF
YOU1000000117_S0000022	AND TO KIND OF DOWNGRADE EXPECTATIONS A LITTLE BIT
YOU1000000117_S0000023	BUT THE PARTICULAR ADVICE I WOULD GIVE IS IF YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR SPOUSE THERE'S ALWAYS THINGS THAT WE REALLY LOVE ABOUT OUR SPOUSE THAT THAT IN A RELATIONSHIP WE DO VERY VERY WELL TOGETHER
YOU1000000117_S0000024	AND THIS IS THE TIME TO DOUBLE DOWN ON THOSE GOOD THINGS
YOU1000000117_S0000025	IF YOU BOTH CONNECT IN TERMS OF HANGING OUT WITH THE KIDS AND WORKING WITH THE KIDS THAT'S A TIME TO DOUBLE DOWN ON
YOU1000000117_S0000026	YOU BOTH CONNECT ON HUMOR YOU KNOW NOW'S THE TIME TO BE WATCHING A COMEDY MOVIE TOGETHER
YOU1000000117_S0000027	AND SO THE BASIC ADVICE IS TO KIND OF SHOW THEM AND YOURSELF A LITTLE COMPASSION LIKE NOW IS THE TIME TO KIND OF DOWN REGULATE YOUR EXPECTATIONS
YOU1000000117_S0000028	BUT ALSO IF THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE GOOD IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP BE VERY INTENTIONAL ABOUT PROMOTING THOSE IN THIS TOUGH TIME
YOU1000000117_S0000029	THAT SOMETIMES REQUIRES A LITTLE CREATIVITY YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE THE THING YOU'RE GREAT WITH WITH YOUR SPOUSE IS GOING OUT TO DINNER AND HAVING THESE WONDERFUL OUTDOOR DATES
YOU1000000117_S0000030	YOU MIGHT NEED TO GET CREATIVE BUT WITH A LITTLE CREATIVITY YOU CAN REALLY PATCH UP A RELATIONSHIP
YOU1000000117_S0000031	AND KIND OF DOWNREGULATE THE STRESS THAT WE SEE
YOU1000000117_S0000032	REMEMBER IN NATURAL DISASTERS IT IS A TIME THAT WE SEE THINGS LIKE DIVORCE RATES INCREASING
YOU1000000117_S0000033	BUT IT'S ALSO THE TIME THAT WE SEE NEW RELATIONSHIPS FORMING PEOPLE MAKING BABIES
YOU1000000117_S0000034	IT REALLY DEPENDS ON YOUR INTENTIONAL EFFORTS YOU CAN MAKE THIS CHALLENGING TIME BETTER IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP
YOU1000000117_S0000035	SO THAT WAS ELIZABETH'S QUESTION NEXT QUESTION WE HAVE UP IS FROM MELISSA
YOU1000000117_S0000036	SHE ASKS HOW DO WE STAY INFORMED WITH CURRENT AND UPDATED NEWS WITHOUT INCREASING OUR ANXIOUS FEELINGS WE MAY HAVE
YOU1000000117_S0000037	THIS IS ANOTHER ONE I'M STRUGGLING WITH AS WELL LIKE LIKE YOU I WANT TO BE INFORMED ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN MY TOWN YOU KNOW WHAT HAS THE PRESIDENT SAID RECENTLY AND SO ON
YOU1000000117_S0000038	BUT I FEEL LIKE EVERY TIME I WATCH THE NEWS I CAN WATCH MY ANXIETY SKYROCKET
YOU1000000117_S0000039	IN TERMS OF WHAT ANXIETY FEELS LIKE IN THE BODY FOR ME THAT'S WATCHING MY CHEST CONSTRICT I'M WATCHING MYSELF BREATHE FASTER IT JUST KIND OF DOESN'T FEEL GOOD
YOU1000000117_S0000040	AND SO THIS IS A REAL CHALLENGE OF HOW TO STAY INFORMED WITHOUT CREATING MORE ANXIETY
YOU1000000117_S0000041	THE WAY I'VE BEEN ABLE TO SOLVE IT MYSELF IS TO KIND OF DO THAT PAYING ATTENTION THAT MINDFULNESS ABOUT WHAT THE NEWS IS MAKING ME FEEL
YOU1000000117_S0000042	AND THERE'S TIMES WHEN IT FEELS LIKE INFORMATION AND THERE'S TIMES WHEN IT FEELS LIKE I'M ALREADY REALLY ANXIOUS
YOU1000000117_S0000043	I DON'T WANT TO ADD TO THAT BY ADDING ANY MORE NEWS ONTO IT
YOU1000000117_S0000044	AND SO I THINK THE KEY IS TO JUST BE REALLY DELIBERATE ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE CONSUMING
YOU1000000117_S0000045	AND ALSO TO HAVE SOME CHOICE ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE CONSUMING YOU CAN PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT'S GOING ON BUT TRY TO UPREGULATE THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE POSITIVE NEWS
YOU1000000117_S0000046	SO FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A WONDERFUL HASHTAG ON TWITTER CALLED COVID KINDNESS WHICH YOU CAN USE TO CHECK OUT TO SEE ALL THE GOOD THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING OUT THERE
YOU1000000117_S0000047	AND SO I THINK TRYING TO BALANCE SOME OF THE DOOM AND GLOOM THAT YOU'RE SEEING WITH SOME OF THE POSITIVE THINGS CAN BE REALLY POWERFUL
YOU1000000117_S0000048	BUT BUT HONESTLY WHAT I'VE DONE MYSELF IS TO REALLY DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF NEWS THAT I'M CONSUMING
YOU1000000117_S0000049	PARTICULARLY BEFORE I GO TO BED I NOW HAVE A RULE LIKE BASICALLY PAST SIX OR SEVEN PM
YOU1000000117_S0000050	I PUT MY PHONE AWAY I'M NOT ON SOCIAL MEDIA AS MUCH I'M REALLY TRYING TO NOT BE CONSUMING THE NEWS AT THAT TIME
YOU1000000117_S0000051	BECAUSE I'M WATCHING IT MINDFULLY AND NOTICING THAT IT'S AFFECTING MY SLEEP
YOU1000000117_S0000052	MOST OF THAT INFORMATION IS GOING TO BE THERE THE NEXT MORNING AND SO FIND WAYS TO PROTECT YOUR SLEEP AND TO PROTECT YOUR OWN ANXIETY LEVELS
YOU1000000117_S0000053	AND IT'S OKAY TO BE SELF COMPASSIONATE IF YOU NEED TO AVOID SOME OF THAT STUFF
YOU1000000117_S0000054	AGAIN THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR NEWS CYCLE IS GOING TO BE BACK WHEN YOU LOOK AGAIN YOU'RE NOT GONNA MISS TOO MUCH
YOU1000000117_S0000056	AND SO NEXT QUESTION THIS COMES FROM A BUNCH OF FOLKS LIE AND JENNA AND ANNA ALL ASKING SIMILAR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS FOR FRONTLINE WORKERS
YOU1000000117_S0000057	THEY ASK BASICALLY HOW CAN FRONTLINE WORKERS AND HEALTHCARE WORKERS GENERALLY PRACTICE SELF CARE AND COMBAT ANXIETY YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO SUPPORT THESE WORKERS
YOU1000000117_S0000058	I'M SO GLAD THIS QUESTION CAME UP AND IT'S GREAT THAT IT CAME UP FROM SO MANY FOLKS
YOU1000000117_S0000059	BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I CARE ABOUT VERY DEEPLY I'M SO GRATEFUL THAT THERE ARE HEALTHCARE WORKERS OUT THERE REALLY RISKING THEIR HEALTH AND THEIR LIVES
YOU1000000117_S0000060	TO PROTECT ME AND MY FAMILY AND MY COMMUNITY AND SO THANK YOU WITH GRATITUDE FOR THE FACT THAT YOU'RE DOING THAT
YOU1000000117_S0000061	I THINK THERE ARE LOTS OF INTENTIONAL THINGS THAT EVEN FOLKS WHO ARE ON THE FRONT LINE CAN DO TO PROTECT THEIR MENTAL HEALTH IN THIS SCARY TIME
YOU1000000117_S0000062	ONE OF THOSE THINGS COMES FROM A REFOCUS THAT YOU REALLY NEED TO PROTECT YOUR OWN MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS DURING THIS TIME
YOU1000000117_S0000063	AND THAT MEANS EXPLICITLY TAKING TIME TO KIND OF PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR ANXIETY LEVELS AND WATCH THE THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO TO DEAL WITH THAT
YOU1000000117_S0000064	I THINK IN BETWEEN PATIENTS IF YOU CAN GIVE YOURSELF A BREAK FOR SAY THREE CONSCIOUS BREATHS
YOU1000000117_S0000065	THREE VERY SLOW BREATHS WHERE YOU BREATHE INTO YOUR BELLY
YOU1000000117_S0000066	AND JUST KIND OF HAVE A MOMENT TO TAKE A SECOND AND BE PRESENT
YOU1000000117_S0000067	THOSE THINGS WILL DOWN REGULATE YOUR SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM IT WILL KICK IN THE PARASYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY THAT WE KNOW ALLOWS FOR KIND OF REST AND DIGEST
YOU1000000117_S0000068	AND THE MORE YOU CAN SORT OF TAKE SHORT BREAKS TO DO THAT ALL THE MORE POWERFUL
YOU1000000117_S0000069	I THINK A SECOND THING I WOULD SAY FOR HEALTHCARE WORKERS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE REFRAMING WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN AS POSITIVE A WAY AS POSSIBLE
YOU1000000117_S0000070	I MEAN ULTIMATELY YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING THAT'S INCREDIBLY BRAVE THAT'S HELPING FOLKS BUT SOMETIMES IN THE FRANTIC DAY TO DAY ANXIOUSNESS OF THAT YOU CAN LOSE THAT
YOU1000000117_S0000071	AND THERE'S LOTS OF RESEARCH BY FOLKS LIKE DAVID DESTENO AND OTHERS THAT SHOWS THAT TAKING TIME TO REALIZE THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS COMPASSIONATELY HELPING OTHER PEOPLE
YOU1000000117_S0000072	RECOGNIZING THAT IT'S A PRO SOCIAL ACTION CAN ACTUALLY ALLOW YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE RESILIENCE AND IT CAN ACTUALLY UPREGULATE WHAT'S CALLED YOUR SELF REGULATION YOUR ABILITY TO DO HARD THINGS
YOU1000000117_S0000073	AND SO I THINK KIND OF TURNING ON YOUR COMPASSION MUSCLES TURNING ON THIS IDEA THAT YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING PRO SOCIALLY CAN BE INCREDIBLY POWERFUL
YOU1000000117_S0000074	AND THE FINAL QUICK TIP THIS IS MORE OF A PRACTICE TIP BUT FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS RIGHT NOW IS THAT
YOU1000000117_S0000075	THERE'S LOTS OF EVIDENCE THAT SPECIFIC KINDS OF MEDITATION PRACTICES CAN REDUCE BURNOUT EVEN IN INCREDIBLY STRESSFUL TIMES
YOU1000000117_S0000076	THIS IS TRUE FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS BUT ALSO SERVICE PROVIDERS AND EVEN FOLKS LIKE WHO WORK AT THE GROCERY STORE WHO REALLY HAVE TO GIVE UP AND SACRIFICE RIGHT NOW TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE
YOU1000000117_S0000077	AND THE SPECIFIC KIND OF MEDITATION IS WHAT'S KNOWN AS LOVING KINDNESS MEDITATION OR METTA
YOU1000000117_S0000078	IT'S BASICALLY A MEDITATION PRACTICE WHERE YOU WORK ON PRACTICING COMPASSION YOU ACTUALLY THINK ABOUT DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE
YOU1000000117_S0000079	AND EXTEND TO THEM INFORMATION ABOUT BEING HAPPY AND HEALTHY
YOU1000000117_S0000080	ACTUALLY USE A MANTRA OF MAY YOU BE HAPPY MAY YOU BE HEALTHY
YOU1000000117_S0000081	BUT THE RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT THE SIMPLE ACT OF DOING THIS EVEN RARELY TEMPORARILY CAN ALLOW YOU TO FEEL COMPASSION THIS URGE TO HELP PEOPLE WITHOUT THE EMPATHY THAT GOES WITH
YOU1000000117_S0000082	IN OTHER WORDS WITHOUT THE KIND OF BURNOUT THAT COMES FROM FEELING THOSE OTHER PEOPLE'S EMOTIONS
YOU1000000117_S0000083	I THINK THIS CAN BE AN INCREDIBLY POWERFUL TECHNIQUE FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS RIGHT NOW YOU CAN START IT TODAY
YOU1000000117_S0000084	LOTS OF FREE APPS ONLINE FROM INSIGHT TIMER TO CALM TO EVEN TEN PERCENT HAPPIER WITH DAN HARRIS THERE
YOU1000000117_S0000085	ALLOWING HEALTHCARE WORKERS TO USE THESE THINGS FREELY AVAILABLE
YOU1000000117_S0000086	AND THEY'RE ALLOWING THOSE HEALTH CARE WORKERS TO ACCESS LOVING KINDNESS MEDITATION SPECIFICALLY
YOU1000000117_S0000087	JUMP ON AND DO ONE OF THESE MEDITATIONS EVEN FOR FIVE MINUTES IN THE MORNING YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE TAKING YOUR SHOWER
YOU1000000117_S0000088	IT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT CAN REALLY IMPROVE YOUR KIND OF RESILIENCE AND PROTECT YOU FROM BURNOUT LATER ON
YOU1000000117_S0000089	OKAY SO THAT WAS ABOUT HEALTH CARE WORKERS NOW WE HAVE A NEW QUESTION FROM TRACY
YOU1000000117_S0000090	TRACY ASKS HOW DO YOU KEEP YOURSELF POSITIVE DURING THIS TIME WHEN LIVING ALONE WHEN YOU'RE AWAY FROM YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS
YOU1000000117_S0000091	I THINK THIS ONE IS THE THE FLIP SIDE OF THE QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED EARLIER ABOUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THE STRESS OF LIVING WITH YOUR SPOUSE
YOU1000000117_S0000092	THERE'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF STRESS THAT COMES FROM LIVING ALONE AND BEING AWAY FROM FAMILY AND FRIENDS IN THIS REALLY HARD TIME
YOU1000000117_S0000093	I THINK THE ANSWER TO THIS ONE IS THAT YOU CAN BE PHYSICALLY ALONE WITHOUT BEING SOCIALLY ALONE
YOU1000000117_S0000094	IN OTHER WORDS YOU CAN BE USING TECHNOLOGY TO REACH OUT TO ALL THOSE FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS
YOU1000000117_S0000095	AND I THINK IN THIS SCARY TIME WE NEED TO BE DOING THIS EVEN MORE THAN EVER AND EVEN MORE INTENTIONALLY THAN EVER
YOU1000000117_S0000096	YOU KNOW IT'S ONE THING TO KIND OF BE HOME ALONE BUT IT'S ANOTHER TO KNOW THAT YOU HAVE YOU KNOW ZOOM YOGA CLASSES WITH FRIENDS OF YOURS
YOU1000000117_S0000097	OR A ZOOM DINNER DATE WITH YOUR PARENTS WHO ARE FAR AWAY IN DIFFERENT TIME ZONES
YOU1000000117_S0000098	THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS YOU CAN BUILD INTO YOUR DAY EVEN IF YOU'RE LIVING ALONE AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY CRITICAL
YOU1000000117_S0000099	ONE THING TO KNOW IS THAT THE SCIENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE ACT OF INTENTIONALLY CONNECTING IN REAL TIME YOU KNOW KIND OF WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW WHERE I'M TALKING TO YOU AND YOU'RE HEARING ME IN REAL TIME
YOU1000000117_S0000100	THAT CAN BE ALMOST AS GOOD AS A REGULAR SOCIAL CONNECTION AND SO WE SHOULD BE EMBRACING THESE A LOT MORE
YOU1000000117_S0000101	I THINK ANOTHER THING YOU CAN DO IF YOU'RE LIVING ALONE IS TO EMBRACE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT SOLITUDE GIVES YOU IN TERMS OF OTHER MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS
YOU1000000117_S0000102	SO I'M THINKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE QUIET TIME FOR MEDITATION
YOU1000000117_S0000103	OR EVEN ALONE TIME SO THAT YOU CAN ENGAGE IN A LITTLE BIT MORE EXERCISE YOU KNOW
YOU1000000117_S0000104	GRAB A YOGA MAT EVEN FROM A SMALL APARTMENT AND DO ONE OF THE MANY FREE ONLINE EXERCISE CLASSES THAT ARE COMING NOW
YOU1000000117_S0000105	I THINK IF YOU'RE ALONE IN THIS CRISIS IT CAN ACTUALLY PROVIDE SOME TIME TO RESET THINGS AND FOCUS ON YOUR OWN MENTAL HEALTH
YOU1000000117_S0000106	IN A WAY THAT MIGHT BE TRICKY IF YOU'RE NOT SORT OF SHELTERING IN PLACE IN THAT VERY STRANGE SITUATION
YOU1000000117_S0000108	AND SO THAT WAS TRACY'S QUESTION NOW WE'RE MOVING ON TO BRIE BRIE IS ASKING HOW CAN WE STAY FOCUSED SANE AND PRODUCTIVE AT WORK
YOU1000000117_S0000109	PARTICULARLY WITH THE BIG ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM WHICH IS THE THREAT OF LAYOFFS
YOU1000000117_S0000110	THIS IS ANOTHER REALLY HUGE ONE AND I THINK I WANT TO START WITH THIS QUESTION FIRST BY VALIDATING IT
YOU1000000117_S0000111	YEAH A LOT OF US ARE FACING THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING LAID OFF FROM WORK HAVING LESS HOURS
YOU1000000117_S0000112	IN ADDITION TO THIS PHYSICAL CRISIS AND THIS MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS A LOT OF US ARE FACING A REAL ECONOMIC CRISIS AND THAT'S INCREDIBLY SCARY
YOU1000000117_S0000113	AND SO I THINK THE FIRST THING IS TO JUST HAVE SOME SELF COMPASSION WITH YOURSELF ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH THIS
YOU1000000117_S0000114	I'M EXPERIENCING THIS NOW WITH MANY OF MY GRADUATE AND PH D STUDENTS
YOU1000000117_S0000115	FEEL LIKE THEY SHOULD BE WORKING AND BEING JUST AS PRODUCTIVE AS BEFORE BUT THAT CAN'T POSSIBLY BE TRUE BECAUSE WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC WHERE EVERYONE IS STRESSED
YOU1000000117_S0000116	AND EVEN IF WE'RE REACTING TO IT REALLY WELL ONE DAY THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE NEXT DAY WE WON'T FEEL IT REALLY DEEPLY AND BE UNABLE TO WORK
YOU1000000117_S0000117	AND SO I THINK THE FIRST PIECE OF ADVICE IS JUST TO ALLOW YOURSELF SOME SELF COMPASSION
YOU1000000117_S0000118	GIVE YOURSELF THE SAME SELF COMPASSION AS YOU WOULD GIVE TO A FRIEND WHO IS GOING THROUGH THAT SORT OF SAME THING
YOU1000000117_S0000119	ALL OF US RIGHT NOW ARE GOING TO BE A LITTLE LESS PRODUCTIVE THAN USUAL
YOU1000000117_S0000120	THE SECOND PIECE OF ADVICE IS ACTUALLY TO REMEMBER SOME OF THE CAUSAL ARROWS YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT ON THE PODCAST AND IN MY CLASS
YOU1000000117_S0000121	IN OTHER WORDS THAT WE OFTEN THINK THAT PRODUCTIVITY WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT FIRST AND THEN WE'LL BE HAPPY BECAUSE WE'LL BE PRODUCTIVE AT WORK
YOU1000000117_S0000122	BUT THE RESEARCH ACTUALLY SUGGESTS THE OTHER ARROW IN OTHER WORDS THAT BY FOCUSING ON OUR MENTAL HEALTH DURING THIS TIME IT CAN ACTUALLY INCREASE OUR PRODUCTIVITY
YOU1000000117_S0000123	AND SO THAT WOULD BE THE DIRECTION I SUGGEST YOU THINK ABOUT GOING WHAT CAN YOU DO TO REDUCE YOUR ANXIETY RIGHT NOW
YOU1000000117_S0000124	BUMP UP YOUR SOCIAL CONNECTIONS SO YOU FEEL A LITTLE BIT MORE LIKE CONNECTED AND TRUSTING ABOUT YOUR COMMUNITY
YOU1000000117_S0000125	WHAT CAN YOU DO TO INCREASE A LITTLE BIT OF EXERCISE LATELY THOSE TYPES OF THINGS WILL BUMP UP YOUR MENTAL HEALTH
YOU1000000117_S0000126	AND BY FOCUSING ON THAT YOU'LL END UP INCREASING YOUR PRODUCTIVITY SEPARATELY
YOU1000000117_S0000127	AND SO THOSE WOULD BE MY KIND OF PRODUCTIVITY TIPS FIRST OF ALL JUST LIKE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE SAME
YOU1000000117_S0000128	NO ONE IS GOING TO BE THE SAME AND IN SOME WAYS THE WHOLE WORLD IS IN THIS BOAT
YOU1000000117_S0000129	KIND OF LAY OFF YOURSELF OF THE GUILT A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE WE'RE KIND OF ALL GOING THROUGH IT
YOU1000000117_S0000130	AND THE SECOND IS THAT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON PRODUCTIVITY YOU NEED TO GIVE YOURSELF SOME SPACE TO DO THE THINGS THAT WILL REALLY HELP YOUR MENTAL HEALTH TOO
YOU1000000117_S0000131	OKAY SO THAT WAS FROM NOW WE HAVE A SIMILAR QUESTION FROM ANGELA WHO'S ASKED MAYBE MORE SPECIFICALLY I'VE BEEN LAID OFF BECAUSE OF COVID NINETEEN
YOU1000000117_S0000132	HOW DO I DO THE SOUL SEARCHING NECESSARY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I WANT TO DO NEXT AND WHAT JOBS AND INDUSTRIES ARE GOING TO BE FULFILLING
YOU1000000117_S0000133	I THINK AGAIN THIS IS ONE OF THESE WAYS OF USING THE NEGATIVE THINGS IN LIFE TO SORT OF SEE THE BLESSINGS INSIDE OF THEM
YOU1000000117_S0000134	AGAIN YOU KNOW LOSING YOUR JOB IS AN AWFUL THING TO HAVE HAPPEN AND IT COMES WITH A LOT OF UNCERTAINTIES
YOU1000000117_S0000135	BUT IT ALSO BRINGS WITH IT THE POSSIBILITY OF NEW DIRECTIONS
YOU1000000117_S0000136	LIKE YOU CAN START THINKING MORE ABOUT WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU FOUND MEANINGFUL ABOUT YOUR JOB
YOU1000000117_S0000137	WHAT ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO BUILD INTO A JOB THAT'S COMING NEXT
YOU1000000117_S0000138	AGAIN SO MANY OF US ARE IN THIS CRISIS RIGHT NOW AND GOING THROUGH THESE THINGS
YOU1000000117_S0000139	BUT ALSO ALL OF US MOST OF US ARE GOING TO GET THROUGH TO THE OTHER SIDE
YOU1000000117_S0000140	WHEN WE'RE IN THE CRUX OF IT IT'S HARD TO THINK THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER SIDE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE'RE JUST FACING THE UNCERTAINTY OF KIND OF YOU KNOW MONTHS INSIDE AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
YOU1000000117_S0000141	BUT LIKE ALL CRISES WE'RE GOING TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE
YOU1000000117_S0000142	AND EVEN THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE GOING THROUGH ECONOMIC AND OTHER STRIKES RIGHT NOW ARE GOING TO FIND OTHER OPTIONS WHEN YOU GET OUT
YOU1000000117_S0000143	AND I THINK YOU CAN USE THIS TIME TO DO SOME REAL SOUL SEARCHING
YOU1000000117_S0000144	ONE OF THE KIND OF BLESSINGS OF BEING IN A POSITION OF MAYBE LOSING YOUR JOB OR LOSING SOME HOURS AT WORK
YOU1000000117_S0000145	IS THAT YOU WIND UP HAVING A TIME WINDFALL YOU WIND UP HAVING MORE TIME
YOU1000000117_S0000146	AND THAT MEANS THAT YOU CAN HAVE THE BLESSING OF HAVING WHAT'S CALLED TIME AFFLUENCE THE SORT OF FEELING OF BEING WEALTHY IN TIME
YOU1000000117_S0000147	IF YOU CAN KIND OF GET AROUND THE UNCERTAINTY OF HAVING THE EXTRA TIME IT CAN ACTUALLY BE A REALLY POWERFUL TIME TO DO THINGS LIKE TAKE TIME TO JOURNAL ABOUT WHAT YOU FIND MOST MEANINGFUL
YOU1000000117_S0000148	OR ENGAGE IN THE KINDS OF STRATEGIES THAT RESEARCHERS LIKE AMY RESNIK AND OTHER USES TO JOB CRAFT
YOU1000000117_S0000149	TO REALLY THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU FIND MOST MEANINGFUL IN YOUR WORK AND SORT OF PLAN THAT MOVING FORWARD
YOU1000000117_S0000150	IF YOU'RE TAKING THE CLASS ANGELA I WOULD ALSO SUGGEST THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO GO BACK TO THAT STRENGTH TEST THAT YOU MIGHT RECALL
YOU1000000117_S0000151	TRYING TO FOCUS ON YOUR CHARACTER STRENGTHS AND GETTING A SENSE OF WHAT THOSE ARE THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME TO FIGURE OUT WHAT PARTS OF YOUR WORK ARE MAPPING ONTO THOSE STRENGTHS
YOU1000000117_S0000152	AND IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WORK IN THE FUTURE WHAT YOU COULD DO THAT KIND OF BUILDS THOSE UP IN AN EVEN MORE ROBUST WAY
YOU1000000117_S0000153	SO THAT WAS A QUESTION FROM ANGELA WE'RE CRUISING THROUGH ALL THESE QUESTIONS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SENDING IN ALL THESE GREAT ONES
YOU1000000117_S0000154	THE NEXT ONE UP IS FROM JESSICA JESSICA NOTES I'VE BEEN DOING OK SO FAR BUT ONE OF MY CHILDREN HAS BEEN REALLY SAD ABOUT MISSING SCHOOL AND HIS FRIENDS IS THERE ANY WAY I CAN HELP HIM
YOU1000000117_S0000155	AND AGAIN JUST START BY JUST VALIDATING THIS YOU KNOW THIS IS A SCARY AND UNCERTAIN AND AN ANXIETY PROVOKING TIME FOR US
YOU1000000117_S0000156	IT'S SO MUCH WORSE FOR OUR CHILDREN RIGHT WHO WHO REALLY JUST DON'T HAVE THE KIND OF FRONTAL LOBE TOOLS TO REGULATE ABOUT THIS CRISIS
YOU1000000117_S0000157	SO I THINK ANYTHING YOU CAN DO TO HELP THEIR ANXIETY THEIR UNCERTAINTY CAN BE INCREDIBLY POWERFUL
YOU1000000117_S0000158	THE FIRST TIP I WOULD GIVE FOR HELPING KIDS DURING THIS TOUGH TIME IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE A ROUTINE
YOU1000000117_S0000159	ONE OF THE PROBLEMS ABOUT BEING OUT OF SCHOOL AND OUT OF THE TYPICAL DAY THAT KIDS FACE IS THAT THEY'RE USED TO HAVING A CERTAIN ROUTINE AND NOW IT'S GONE AWAY
YOU1000000117_S0000160	AND WE AS HUMANS ARE CREATURES OF HABIT LIKE WE KIND OF WORK BEST AND FEEL LESS ANXIOUS WHEN WE'RE IN A CONSISTENT SCHEDULE AND A CONSISTENT ROUTINE
YOU1000000117_S0000162	SO EVEN IF YOUR KIDS AREN'T IN A CONSISTENT SCHEDULE RIGHT NOW YOU SHOULD MAKE ONE UP FOR THEM
YOU1000000117_S0000163	YOU SHOULD FIND A WAY THAT YOU KNOW LIKE BREAKFAST IS FROM NINE TO TEN AND FROM TEN TO ELEVEN
YOU1000000117_S0000164	YOU KNOW YOU'RE DOING YOUR MATH HOMEWORK OR MAYBE YOU'RE WATCHING CARTOONS OR MAYBE YOU GET TO PLAY VIDEO GAMES IT KIND OF DOESN'T MATTER
YOU1000000117_S0000165	BUT JUST HAVE A CONSISTENT SCHEDULE THAT YOU END UP KIND OF ANNOUNCING TO YOUR KIDS AND STICKING WITH
YOU1000000117_S0000166	THE OTHER PIECE OF ADVICE I WOULD GIVE IS IS AGAIN TO TO DO THE SAME THING THAT WE NEED TO DO WHEN WE'RE FEELING ANXIOUS AND WE'RE FEELING STRESSED AND WE'RE FEELING SAD IN OTHER WORDS THE KIND OF SAME TYPES OF TIPS I WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT
YOU1000000117_S0000167	KIDS TOO CAN BENEFIT FROM HAVING SOCIAL CONNECTION THROUGH THINGS LIKE ZOOM AND SO ON
YOU1000000117_S0000168	FOR OLDER KIDS THAT CAN BE THE SAME WAY WE DO IT AS ADULTS
YOU1000000117_S0000169	BUT EVEN FOR YOUNGER KIDS THAT CAN BE THE KIND OF THING THAT YOU SET UP AND STRUCTURE
YOU1000000117_S0000170	MY COLLEAGUE JAMAL ZACKY WHO'S A SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGIST WHO WAS ON THE HAPPINESS LAB PODCAST
YOU1000000117_S0000171	HE HAS REALLY YOUNGER KIDS AND HE NOTES THAT HE AND HIS FRIENDS ARE SETTING UP PLAY DATES OVER ZOOM
YOU1000000117_S0000172	THEY'RE KIND OF GOING ONLINE AND PRINTING OUT THE SAME COLORING PAGES SO THAT KIDS CAN COLOR TOGETHER COLOR THE SAME THING
YOU1000000117_S0000173	ACROSS THE WAY ACROSS ZOOM AND THAT CAN BE REALLY POWERFUL KIND OF GIVING THIS STRUCTURE OF SOCIAL CONNECTION BACK TO YOUR KIDS WHEN THEY NEED IT
YOU1000000117_S0000174	BUT ANOTHER THING TO BUILD IN I THINK WOULD BE TO ALLOW KIDS TO SEE THAT AGAIN THIS ISN'T ALL DOOM AND GLOOM
YOU1000000117_S0000175	IF YOU LOOK LIKE THERE ARE HEROES AND REAL STORIES OF KINDNESS OUT THERE
YOU1000000117_S0000176	AND SO ANOTHER TIP WOULD BE TO KIND OF EXPOSE YOUR KIDS TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE GOOD THINGS HAPPENING
YOU1000000117_S0000177	TELL THEM YOUR STORIES ABOUT COVID KINDNESS THAT YOU'RE READING ABOUT IN THE NEWS
YOU1000000117_S0000178	TALK TO THEM ABOUT THE HEROES THAT ARE DOING GREAT THINGS
YOU1000000117_S0000179	AND ALLOW THEM TO EXPERIENCE THE FACT THAT THERE'S GOOD STUFF OUT THERE AS WELL
YOU1000000117_S0000180	I THINK THE THIRD AND FINAL TIP IS THAT YOU KNOW YOU BEING THE HEAD OF THE HOUSE ARE GOING TO HAVE A HUGE EMOTIONAL IMPACT ON YOUR KIDS
YOU1000000117_S0000181	IF YOU LISTEN TO PAST EPISODES OF THE HAPPINESS LAB YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT CASES OF EMOTIONAL CONTAGION
YOU1000000117_S0000182	AND THE FACT THAT WE ARE OFTEN PART OF THESE AFFECTIVE SPIRALS
YOU1000000117_S0000183	ONE MEMBER OF OUR TEAM OR OUR FAMILIES FEEL A CERTAIN WAY FEELS PANICKY AND THEN THAT PANIC CAN BE CONTAGIOUS AND IT TRANSMITS AND IT GETS WORSE
YOU1000000117_S0000184	REMEMBER THAT YOU CAN BE THE CALM IN THE STORM FOR YOUR KIDS YOU KNOW IF YOU TAKE TIME TO REGULATE YOUR OWN ANXIETY DO YOUR OWN DEEP BREATH BEFORE YOU FACE THEM
YOU1000000117_S0000185	IF YOU'RE DESCRIBING THIS THIS SITUATION AS A CHALLENGE NOT A CRISIS YOU'RE GOING TO TRANSMIT THAT CALM AND THAT THOSE POSITIVE STATES TO THEM
YOU1000000117_S0000186	THAT CAN BE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT YOU KNOW ONE OF THE BEST THINGS YOU CAN DO RIGHT NOW TO HELP YOUR COMMUNITY IS TO BE EMBODYING THOSE POSITIVE EMOTIONS YOURSELF
YOU1000000117_S0000187	AND THAT OFTEN MEANS DOING THE RIGHT THINGS TO PROTECT YOUR OWN WELL BEING THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT
YOU1000000117_S0000188	OKAY SO THAT WAS ONE FROM JESSICA NOW WE'RE MOVING ON TO ONE FROM LINDSEY
YOU1000000117_S0000189	LINDSEY ASKS IN YOUR COURSE WE LEARNED ABOUT HOW EXPERIENCES AND NOT THINGS MAKE US HAPPY
YOU1000000117_S0000190	IN THIS TIME OF SOCIAL DISTANCING AND SELF QUARANTINE ARE THERE ANY SUGGESTIONS YOU HAVE FOR EXPERIENCES WE COULD CREATE INDEPENDENTLY OR WITH OUR FAMILIES
YOU1000000117_S0000191	I LOVE THIS QUESTION IN PART BECAUSE IT'S YOU KNOW DOING ALL THE THINGS THAT I SUGGEST RIGHT WHICH IS LIKE BEING PROACTIVE
YOU1000000117_S0000192	KNOW USING THE THE TOPICS THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT IN THE COURSE AND THE INTERVENTIONS WE'VE SEEN IN THE COURSE IN THIS SPECIAL TIME
YOU1000000117_S0000193	I THINK ONE OF THE ODD BUT GREAT THINGS ABOUT THIS CURRENT TIME IS THAT WE'RE ALL IN A NEW SITUATION
YOU1000000117_S0000194	LIKE WE'RE ALL FACED WITH BEING AT HOME IN A WAY WE HAVEN'T BEEN BEFORE WE HAVE MORE TIME WITH OUR KIDS MORE TIME WITH OUR FAMILIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT
YOU1000000117_S0000195	ALL THE RESEARCH IN PSYCHOLOGY SUGGESTS THAT WE CAN HARNESS THESE NEW SITUATIONS TO FORM NEW DIFFERENT HABITS
YOU1000000117_S0000196	IN OTHER WORDS WE CAN START THINGS THAT WE HADN'T TRIED BEFORE YOU KNOW NEW GAME NIGHTS NEW FAMILY DINNERS NEW TRADITIONS
YOU1000000117_S0000197	ALL OF THESE THINGS BECAUSE WE'RE IN THIS MOMENT WHERE WE START A NEW SITUATION
YOU1000000117_S0000198	ARE EASY TO HARNESS WE CAN HARNESS WHAT ARE CALLED FRESH START WHICH IS SOME WONDERFUL RESEARCH BY KATIE MILKMAN AND OTHERS
YOU1000000117_S0000199	SHOWS THAT THESE NEW SITUATIONS AND THESE NEW MOMENTS OF FRESH STARTS ALLOW US TO FORM HABITS BETTER
YOU1000000117_S0000200	AND SO I THINK THIS IS A TIME TO THINK ABOUT WHAT CREATIVE EXPERIENCES YOU COULD COME UP WITH WITH YOUR FAMILY
YOU1000000117_S0000201	YOU KNOW MAYBE YOU START COOKING DINNER WITH YOUR FAMILY IN A DIFFERENT WAY MAYBE YOU START ZOOMING YOU KNOW GRANDMA AND GRANDPA INTO YOUR ZOOM MEETING
YOU1000000117_S0000202	MAYBE YOU ALL ENGAGE IN A YOGA CLASS OR SOME CRAZY EXERCISE TOGETHER
YOU1000000117_S0000203	MAYBE THIS IS THE TIME TO START THAT GRATITUDE YOU KNOW THREE GOOD THINGS THAT YOU LIST BEFORE DINNER WITH YOUR FAMILY
YOU1000000117_S0000204	ALL THESE THINGS ARE EASIER TO START THEIR EXPERIENCES THAT ARE EASIER TO GET GOING
YOU1000000117_S0000205	BECAUSE WE DON'T REALLY HAVE NORMS OF WHAT OUR FAMILIES ARE SUPPOSED TO DO DURING THIS TIME IT'S SO NEW
YOU1000000117_S0000206	AND THAT PROVIDES THIS REAL OPPORTUNITY IF YOU CAN HARNESS IT TO PUT GOOD THINGS IN PLACE FOR YOURSELF AND FOR YOUR FAMILY
YOU1000000117_S0000207	AND SO I THINK FOR THOSE EXPERIENCES YOU KNOW GET REALLY CREATIVE AND AND THAT CAN BE WITH YOUR KIDS BUT IT CAN ALSO BE WITH YOUR SPOUSES
YOU1000000117_S0000208	YOU KNOW WE CAN'T NECESSARILY GO OUT ON THE TYPICAL BORING DINNER DATES OR GO TO THAT SAME RESTAURANT YOU WENT TO EVERY SINGLE WEEK
YOU1000000117_S0000209	SO TRY SOMETHING NEW WHETHER THAT'S YOU KNOW A NEW LIKE SPOT IN THE HOUSE TO HAVE DINNER A NEW CANDLE LIKE PUT DOWN A TABLECLOTH LIKE TRY A NEW MEAL LIKE
YOU1000000117_S0000210	YOU CAN CREATE THESE NOVEL EXPERIENCES AND IF YOU FRAME THESE THINGS AS NOVEL EXPERIENCES THAT CAN BE POWERFUL FOR YOUR WELLBEING AS WELL
YOU1000000117_S0000211	OKAY SO THAT WAS LINDSEY'S QUESTION MOVING ON WE'RE WE'RE REALLY SCROLLING THROUGH SO I'M ENCOURAGING YOU AGAIN TO SEND IN YOUR QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVEN'T YET WE HAVE ABOUT TEN MORE MINUTES IN THIS CHAT SO SEND THEM IN
YOU1000000117_S0000212	NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM CHERYL AND CHERYL ASKS WHAT SHOULD WE DO ABOUT SLEEP PROBLEMS I CAN'T SLEEP ANXIETY UNCERTAINTY ETC
YOU1000000117_S0000213	SHERYL YOU ARE REALLY SPEAKING TO ME BECAUSE I WAS GOING THROUGH THIS PRETTY BADLY ABOUT LAST WEEK
YOU1000000117_S0000214	WHEN I WAS JUST REALIZING THAT I JUST WAS UNABLE TO KIND OF FALL ASLEEP
YOU1000000117_S0000215	EVEN THOUGH I WAS TRYING TO GET TO BED AT A REASONABLE HOUR YOU KNOW MY MIND WAS
YOU1000000117_S0000217	REALLY REALLY HARD
YOU1000000117_S0000219	AND SO I'LL SHARE WITH YOU THE THINGS THAT I'VE DONE TO PROMOTE SLEEP AND THEY'RE ALL THINGS THAT COME FROM THE RESEARCH
YOU1000000117_S0000220	ONE OF THESE IS TO HARNESS THE POWER OF RITUAL BEFORE YOU GO TO SLEEP
YOU1000000117_S0000221	THERE'S LOTS OF FANTASTIC WORK BY MIKE NORTON AND FRANCESCA GINO SHOWING THE POWER OF RITUAL TO CONTROL THINGS WHEN THINGS FEEL OUT OF CONTROL
YOU1000000117_S0000222	AND I THINK RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S PREVENTING US FROM SLEEPING IS THAT EVERYTHING FEELS REALLY OUT OF CONTROL
YOU1000000117_S0000223	AND SO I'VE STARTED SOME YOU KNOW SEEMINGLY DUMB LIKE PRIVATE SLEEP RITUALS YOU KNOW I KIND OF SIT UP AT NIGHT AND KIND OF REMAKE MY BED IF MY BED WASN'T MADE BEFORE
YOU1000000117_S0000224	I HAVE FOUND ALL THE OLD LIKE LOTIONS THAT I HAVE YOU KNOW IN MY CABINET THAT I HAVEN'T USED IN A WHILE AND
YOU1000000117_S0000225	LIKE EVERY NIGHT BEFORE I GO TO BED I KIND OF LIKE YOU KNOW PUT SOME LOTION ON AND TRY TO BE REALLY MINDFUL ABOUT THE WAY IT SMELLS AND THE WAY IT FEELS AND KIND OF GET INTO BED IT SOUNDS REALLY SILLY
YOU1000000117_S0000226	BUT HARNESSING THIS RITUAL THE SCIENCE SUGGESTS CAN KIND OF MAKE YOU FEEL A LITTLE BIT MORE IN CONTROL
YOU1000000117_S0000227	AND IT CAN ALSO TRAIN YOUR BODY THAT LIKE OH WAIT AFTER I DO THE RITUAL OF THE LOTION THEN I GO TO BED
YOU1000000117_S0000228	A SECOND THING THAT I'VE DONE AND THIS IS PROBABLY BEEN EVEN MORE POWERFUL IS TO REALLY REGULATE HOW MUCH ANXIETY PROVOKING MATERIAL I'M LOOKING AT RIGHT BEFORE I GO TO BED
YOU1000000117_S0000229	I KNOW I'VE TOLD LOTS OF YOU ABOUT THE DANGERS OF PHONES AND PARTICULARLY THE DANGERS OF PHONES RIGHT BEFORE YOU GO TO SLEEP
YOU1000000117_S0000230	BUT THIS IS A TIME WHERE WE REALLY NEED TO BE FOLLOWING THAT ADVICE
YOU1000000117_S0000231	BASICALLY I HAVE A RULE NOW THAT AFTER EIGHT PM I PUT MY PHONE AWAY I JUST PUT IT ON SILENT
YOU1000000117_S0000232	PUT IT IN A SPECIFIC SPOT IN MY BEDROOM AND I'M NOT ALLOWED TO USE IT ANYMORE
YOU1000000117_S0000233	WHICH IS TRICKY FOR ME BECAUSE I'M REALLY USED TO KIND OF SCROLLING AND USING MY PHONE BEFORE I GO TO BED
YOU1000000117_S0000234	BUT I'VE TRIED TO SUBSTITUTE THAT HABIT WITH SOMETHING ELSE BECAUSE AS WE KNOW FROM OUR HABIT RESEARCH IF YOU HAVE A CUE BUT NO ACTION TO DO IT CAN BE REALLY HARD TO OVERCOME A BAD HABIT FROM BEFORE
YOU1000000117_S0000235	AND SO MY NEW MY NEW HABIT WHEN I HAVE THE CUE OF LIKE OH I REALLY WANT TO CHECK MY PHONE BEFORE BED IS A PHYSICAL BOOK I'VE JUST FOUND OLD BOOKS IN MY HOUSE THAT I EITHER WANT TO READ OR WE'RE SITTING ON THAT SHELF AND I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO YET AND THOSE ARE THERE
YOU1000000117_S0000236	AND SO THOSE DIFFERENT HABITS OF KIND OF BEGINNING A SORT OF SLEEP RITUAL THAT'S LIKE HEALTHIER
YOU1000000117_S0000237	AND GETTING RID OF THE PHONE WHICH IS BAD BECAUSE OF ITS LIGHT BUT ALSO BECAUSE ON THE OTHER END OF THAT PHONE RIGHT NOW THERE'S A LOT OF ANXIETY PROVOKING CONTENT THAT CAN BE REALLY POWERFUL FOR ME
YOU1000000117_S0000238	AND I GUESS MAYBE THE THIRD THING IS JUST TO PRIORITIZE
YOU1000000117_S0000239	I'VE BEEN TRYING TO YOU KNOW GIVEN THAT WE ALL HAVE A LITTLE BIT MANY OF US HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY WITH OUR WORK TIME
YOU1000000117_S0000240	I'VE BEEN REALLY TRYING TO MOVE ANY WORK MEETINGS THAT ARE EARLY IN THE MORNING TO A LITTLE BIT LATER
YOU1000000117_S0000241	SO EVEN IF I CAN'T GET TO SLEEP OR I'M HAVING SOME RESTLESS SLEEP I HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO MAKE IT UP THESE DAYS
YOU1000000117_S0000242	AND SO HIGHLY HIGHLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO PRIORITIZE SLEEP REMEMBER SLEEP ESSENTIAL FOR YOUR MENTAL HEALTH BUT IT'S ALSO ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS YOU CAN DO RIGHT NOW TO PROTECT YOUR IMMUNE FUNCTION
YOU1000000117_S0000243	DURING A TIME WHEN WE ALL REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE OUR IMMUNE FUNCTION IS AS HIGH AND AS EFFECTIVE AS IT CAN POSSIBLY BE
YOU1000000117_S0000244	OKAY SO UP NEXT QUESTION MARA SOUL IS HERE AND SHE IS ASKING
YOU1000000117_S0000245	I HAVE A COUPLE OF FAMILY MEMBERS THAT HAVE TESTED POSITIVE FOR COVID NINETEEN I FEEL LIKE MY MIND IS FOCUSED ONLY ON THAT SO HOW DO YOU SUPPOSE I GO ABOUT MY DAY WITH CARING FOR MY FAMILY BUT ALSO TAKING CARE OF MY OWN MENTAL HEALTH
YOU1000000117_S0000246	I THINK THIS IS AGAIN I'LL START BY DOING I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE WHICH IS TO VALIDATE THIS
YOU1000000117_S0000247	MANY OF US ARE GOING THROUGH THIS SITUATION WHERE WE KNOW PEOPLE WHO ARE POSITIVE FOR COVID NINETEEN OR PRESUMED POSITIVE FOR COVID NINETEEN IN DIFFERENT SCARIER SITUATION CAN'T GET TESTED
YOU1000000117_S0000248	AND THAT'S INCREDIBLY SCARY AND SOMETIMES THAT COMES WITH THE ADDITIONAL AWFUL THING THAT IF YOU'RE TRYING TO PHYSICALLY DISTANCE YOURSELF OR IF YOU'RE IN A VULNERABLE POSITION YOURSELF
YOU1000000117_S0000249	YOU MIGHT NOT EVEN BE ABLE TO HELP THEM IN THE NORMAL WAY BECAUSE YOU MIGHT NEED TO MAINTAIN SOME DISTANCE FROM THEM
YOU1000000117_S0000250	AND SO I THINK THE FIRST THING TO DO WITH THIS IS TO HAVE SOME SELF COMPASSION THIS IS AN UNPRECEDENTEDLY BAD SITUATION
YOU1000000117_S0000251	AND YOU KIND OF JUST NEED TO BE NICE TO YOURSELF AND STOP FEELING GUILTY
YOU1000000117_S0000252	IF YOU'RE IN THE POSITION WHERE YOU WANT TO BE HELPING YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS AND ARE FEELING FRUSTRATED THAT YOU CAN'T INTERACT WITH THEM DIRECTLY
YOU1000000117_S0000253	IS FOR PEOPLE WHO FOR EXAMPLE HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE FAR AWAY OR FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE VULNERABLE THAT YOU CAN'T GET TO
YOU1000000117_S0000254	I THINK ONE THING THE RESEARCH SUGGESTS YOU CAN DO TO HELP WITH THAT IS TO ALLOW THOSE POSTAL URGES TO COME OUT ANOTHER WAY ARE THERE OTHER ELDERLY FAMILY MEMBERS YOU CAN HELP
YOU1000000117_S0000255	OR SOMETHING ELSE YOU CAN DO THAT'S DOING GOOD IN THE WORLD EVEN IF YOU CAN'T DO GOOD FOR THAT ONE PERSON I THINK THAT CAN BE PARTICULARLY POWERFUL
YOU1000000117_S0000256	BUT IN TERMS OF JUST KIND OF GOING THROUGH THAT SITUATION WITH FAMILY MEMBERS I THINK PART OF IT IS TO FIND WAYS TO REDUCE YOUR OWN SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM ACTIVITY
YOU1000000117_S0000257	I THINK THE STRESS OF HAVING FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE SICK ON OUR OWN BODIES CAN BE INCREDIBLY ANXIETY PROVOKING
YOU1000000117_S0000258	AND I THINK YOU NEED TO JUST TAKE TIME TO KIND OF BREATHE AND AGAIN WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT BEFORE ABOUT KIND OF DOING THESE SLOWER BREATHS THESE BELLY BREATHS WE'RE TALKING A LOT ABOUT ON OUR PODCAST AND THINGS
YOU1000000117_S0000259	BUT THAT'S THE TIME TO DO THAT SORT OF DEEP BREATHING AND AGAIN THAT'S USEFUL
YOU1000000117_S0000260	BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO HELP YOUR OWN IMMUNE FUNCTION IT'S GOING TO SORT OF SHUT OFF THE FIGHT OR FLIGHT SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM ACTIVITY
YOU1000000117_S0000261	AND ALLOW YOU TO TURN ON THIS PARASYMPATHETIC NERVOUS ACTIVITY WHICH IS WHAT WE NEED RIGHT NOW TO SORT OF REST AND DIGEST AND THAT WILL HELP YOUR IMMUNE FUNCTION
YOU1000000117_S0000262	BUT IT WILL ALSO GIVE YOU THE BANDWIDTH TO DEAL WITH THAT STRESSFUL SITUATION
YOU1000000117_S0000263	REMEMBER EVEN IF IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE IT THERE'S A LOT THAT YOU CAN DO TO EMBODY CALM YOURSELF IN ORDER TO HELP THE OTHER PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE
YOU1000000117_S0000264	AND SO VERY VERY HARD AND SCARY SITUATION COMPLETELY VALIDATING THAT
YOU1000000117_S0000265	BUT AGAIN KNOW THAT THERE'S SIMPLE ACTIONS YOU CAN TAKE TO KIND OF TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR OWN EMOTIONS AND SORT OF WORK WITH THEM EVEN IN THIS REALLY SCARY TIME
YOU1000000117_S0000267	FINAL QUESTION BECAUSE WE'RE AT TIME OUR FINAL QUESTION COMES FROM HOLLY
YOU1000000117_S0000268	WHO ASKS THAT HER QUESTION IS AROUND TRYING TO DO RANDOM ACTS OF KINDNESS AND MAKE SOCIAL CONNECTIONS DURING THIS TIME
YOU1000000117_S0000269	SHE HAS A FEW IDEAS IN MIND BUT IT'S HARD TO FIND WAYS IN EVERYDAY LIFE WHEN YOU'RE IN ISOLATION TO DO THIS MORE
YOU1000000117_S0000270	AGREE COMPLETELY YOU KNOW IN THE IN THE COURSE AND ON THE PODCAST WE TALK A LOT ABOUT THESE
YOU1000000117_S0000271	KIND OF RANDOM SOCIAL CONNECTIONS YOU KNOW THE CHATTING WITH THE BARISTA SOCIAL CONNECTIONS THAT HAPPEN REGULARLY YOU KNOW THIS IS THE STUFF THAT WE'RE MISSING MORE AND MORE NOW
YOU1000000117_S0000272	AND SO ONE OF THE TIPS I'VE BEEN GIVING IS TO TRY TO BUILD IN SOCIAL CONNECTION THAT'S NOT THE LIKE VERY FORMAL CONFERENCE CALL WITH THE FOLKS AT WORK BUT REALLY INFORMAL TYPE THINGS
YOU1000000117_S0000273	YOU KNOW LIKE I'M GONNA DO A YOGA CLASS JUST LIKE CALL YOU KNOW TEXT A FEW FRIENDS AND SAY HEY WHO WANTS TO JUMP IN WITH ME
YOU1000000117_S0000274	OR I'M GONNA HAVE A HALF HOUR WHERE I'M CHOPPING VEGETABLES AND TRYING TO DEAL WITH WHATEVER'S IN MY PANTRY TO COOK TONIGHT
YOU1000000117_S0000275	LET ME SEE IF I COULD ZOOM A FRIEND WHO CAN JUMP IN WITH ME THEN
YOU1000000117_S0000276	I THINK THESE INFORMAL SOCIAL INTERACTIONS CAN BE INCREDIBLY POWERFUL
YOU1000000117_S0000277	WE HAVE TO INTENTIONALLY BUILD THEM IN IN A WAY THAT WE DIDN'T BEFORE THE TWO THINGS THERE ONE IS THAT JUST TAKES A LITTLE BIT MORE WORK
YOU1000000117_S0000278	AND THE SECOND THING IS IF YOU FORM THE RIGHT HABIT NOW YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO IMPORT THAT LATER
YOU1000000117_S0000279	SO THAT WHEN THIS WHOLE CRISIS IS OVER YOU'RE DOING THOSE THINGS AS WELL
YOU1000000117_S0000280	IN TERMS OF THE THE RANDOM ACTS OF KINDNESS PART I THINK THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS WE CAN BE DOING TO REACH OUT TO OTHERS
YOU1000000117_S0000281	ONE IS JUST TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS ACT OF SHELTERING IN PLACE STAYING HOME IS A PRO SOCIAL ACTION YOU ARE HELPING OTHER PEOPLE AND HELPING TO FLATTEN THE CURVE
YOU1000000117_S0000282	MAYBE SAVING THOUSANDS OF LIVES BY YOUR SIMPLE ACTION SO MAKE SURE YOU REFRAME IT THAT WAY
YOU1000000117_S0000283	BUT THE OTHER THING IS TO USE WHATEVER WINDFALLS YOU HAVE WHETHER THAT'S EXTRA TIME BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT WORKING AS MUCH
YOU1000000117_S0000284	OR LITTLE FINANCIAL WINDFALL YOU KNOW THOSE OF YOU WHO AREN'T PAYING GAS TO COMMUTE OR BUYING THAT COFFEE AT THE COFFEE SHOP REGULARLY THAT YOU NORMALLY BUY
YOU1000000117_S0000285	THOSE ARE LITTLE FINANCIAL WINDFALL THAT YOU CAN USE TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE
YOU1000000117_S0000286	AND SO WHAT CAN YOU USE TO USE THAT MONEY TO SAY HELP LOCAL BUSINESSES WHO NEED SOME HELP OR IF YOU JUST HAVE EXTRA TIME WHAT CAN YOU DO TO KIND OF CONTACT ELDERLY FAMILY MEMBERS WHO MIGHT NEED A CONNECTION RIGHT NOW
YOU1000000117_S0000287	OR EVEN TALK TO YOUR CONGRESS PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING LIKE THESE ARE THE TIMES WHEN WE CAN USE OUR TEMPORAL WINDFALLS OUR TIME WINDFALLS TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE A LOT
YOU1000000117_S0000288	OKAY I THINK THAT WAS A LOT I HOPE THAT YOU HEARD SOME FANTASTIC SUGGESTIONS
YOU1000000117_S0000289	I WANT YOU TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE MAIN THING THAT I KEEP MENTIONING WHICH IS SELF COMPASSION
YOU1000000117_S0000290	THIS IS A REALLY CHALLENGING TIME AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE NICE TO YOURSELF
YOU1000000117_S0000291	BUT ONE OF THE THINGS YOU CAN DO TO BE NICE TO YOURSELF IS TO REMEMBER WHAT SCIENCE SUGGESTS ABOUT THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT CAN IMPROVE YOUR WELL BEING
YOU1000000117_S0000292	WE KNOW THAT YOU'RE WASHING YOUR HANDS AND DOING GOOD STUFF FOR YOUR PHYSICAL HEALTH I HOPE THIS HAS GIVEN YOU A BUNCH OF TIPS FOR WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR YOUR MENTAL HEALTH TOO
YOU1000000117_S0000293	THERE'S SO MANY COMMENTS ON THERE AND IN GRATITUDE MY WAY THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU'RE VERY WELCOME
YOU1000000117_S0000294	I HOPE THIS HAS GIVEN YOU SOME USEFUL TIPS AND I THANK YOU FOR SIGNING ON THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH
YOU1000000118_S0000001	WE START THE SPECIALIZATION WITH THIS COURSE
YOU1000000118_S0000002	HOW GOOGLE DOES WHERE I INTRODUCE MACHINE LEARNING AND WHAT GOOGLE MEANS WHEN WE SAY WE ARE AI FIRST
YOU1000000118_S0000003	MY COLLEAGUE JOSH THEN COMES IN TO TALK ABOUT THE STRATEGY OF MACHINE LEARNING
YOU1000000118_S0000004	WE END WITH A DISCUSSION OF TOOLING OF HOW TO DO MACHINE LEARNING AT SCALE USING PYTHON NOTEBOOKS AND SERVERLESS DATA PROCESSING COMPONENTS
YOU1000000118_S0000006	NOW IF YOU'RE AN ENGINEER OR SCIENTIST YOU'RE PROBABLY THINKING THAT THIS IS ALL TOO HIGH LEVEL
YOU1000000118_S0000007	AND YOU'RE READY TO JUMP TO THE NEXT COURSE WHICH STARTS TO DELVE INTO TECHNICAL DETAILS OF TENSORFLOW BUT BEFORE YOU MAKE THAT DECISION LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING
YOU1000000118_S0000008	WHEN WE TAUGHT THIS SET OF COURSES TO OUR CUSTOMERS
YOU1000000118_S0000009	ONE REMARK THAT OFTEN CAME BACK WAS THAT THE MODULE BY JOSH WAS THE ONE THEY REVISITED THE MOST OFTEN
YOU1000000118_S0000011	AFTER THEY WENT BACK TO WORK SIX MONTHS LATER THE MODULE THAT THEY WENT TO TO LOOK AT THE MOST WAS ON THE STRATEGY OF MACHINE LEARNING
YOU1000000118_S0000012	SO YOU WANT TO GET THE BIG PICTURE BEFORE YOU DELVE INTO THE TECHNICAL DETAILS
YOU1000000118_S0000013	BECAUSE THE BIG PICTURE IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO GET BUY IN FROM THE REST OF THE ORGANIZATION TO CARRY OUT
YOU1000000118_S0000014	WE THEN MOVE ON TO DOING MACHINE LEARNING WITH TENSORFLOW THAT INVOLVES TWO ASPECTS
YOU1000000118_S0000015	ONE CREATING A GOOD MACHINE LEARNING DATA SET AND TWO BUILDING YOUR FIRST MACHINE LEARNING MODEL WITH TENSORFLOW
YOU1000000118_S0000016	CREATING A MACHINE LEARNING DATA SET IS ANOTHER OF THOSE PRACTICAL MODULES THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO IGNORE
YOU1000000118_S0000017	WHEN YOU CREATE A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL AND IT WORKS WELL IN YOUR EXPERIMENTS BUT THEN FAILS MISERABLY IN PRODUCTION
YOU1000000118_S0000018	THE REASON WILL OFTEN COME BACK TO HOW YOU CREATED THE MACHINE LEARNING DATA SET SO GIVE YOURSELF TIME TO ABSORB THE LESSONS
YOU1000000118_S0000019	AND THEN WE HAVE TWO COURSES THAT ARE ABOUT IMPROVING MACHINE LEARNING ACCURACY
YOU1000000118_S0000020	AS YOU BUILD YOUR FIRST MACHINE LEARNING MODEL YOU WILL LEARN THAT THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS YOU CAN DO TO IMPROVE THAT MODEL
YOU1000000118_S0000021	SO THINK OF THIS SECTION AS FILLING YOUR TOOL CHEST WITH A SET OF IDEAS
YOU1000000118_S0000022	YOU'LL USE DIFFERENT IDEAS IN DIFFERENT SITUATIONS SO YOU'LL FIND THAT KNOWING THEM WILL BE HELPFUL IN YOUR CAREER AS YOU SOLVE DIFFERENT MACHINE LEARNING PROBLEMS
YOU1000000118_S0000023	AND AS BEFORE IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO JUST NAME CHECK THESE CONCEPTS YOU NEED TO GIVE YOURSELF TIME TO UNDERSTAND THEM
YOU1000000118_S0000024	AND KNOW HOW TO IMPLEMENT THEM IN CODE WE THEN MOVE ON TO A SET OF COURSES THAT ARE ABOUT OPERATIONALIZING THE MACHINE LEARNING MODEL
YOU1000000118_S0000025	AS I MENTIONED EARLIER OPERATIONALIZING A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL
YOU1000000118_S0000026	AND BY THAT I MEAN TRAINING IT AT SCALE IN A DISTRIBUTED WAY SERVING OUT THE PREDICTIONS
YOU1000000118_S0000027	BUILDING A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL END TO END OPERATIONALIZING A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL CAN BE SUPER HARD
YOU1000000118_S0000028	IT IS A STAGE WHERE MOST ENTERPRISE MACHINE LEARNING PROJECTS FAIL
YOU1000000118_S0000029	I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MANY COMPANIES I'VE TALKED TO WHO HAVE SAID THEIR INNOVATION TEAMS HAD DEVISED THESE COOL PROJECTS BUT THEY WERE STRUGGLING GETTING THE ML MODELS INTO PRODUCTION
YOU1000000118_S0000030	IN THIS SET OF COURSES WE WILL TALK ABOUT HOW TO TRAIN DEPLOY AND PREDICT WITH ML MODELS IN A WAY THAT THEY'RE PRODUCTION READY
YOU1000000118_S0000031	AND FINALLY WE DELVE BACK INTO MACHINE LEARNING THEORY BUT THEORY IN BIG ARCADES
YOU1000000118_S0000032	MACHINE LEARNING THEORY IS MOSTLY HEURISTICS MACHINE LEARNING IS AN INTENSELY HEURISTIC DISCIPLINE
YOU1000000118_S0000033	AND YOU'RE ONLY AS GOOD AS YOUR BAG OF TOOLS AND TRICKS
YOU1000000118_S0000034	SO WE'LL INTRODUCE A NUMBER OF TOOLS AND TRICKS THAT WORK WHEN THE INPUTS TO YOUR MACHINE LEARNING MODELS ARE IMAGES
YOU1000000118_S0000036	TOOLS AND TRICKS THAT HELP IN YOUR PROCESSING OR OUTPUTTING SEQUENCES
YOU1000000118_S0000037	AND SEQUENCES IN MACHINE LEARNING CAN BE EITHER TIME SERIES DATA OR TEXT DATA
YOU1000000118_S0000038	AND FINALLY WE WILL LOOK AT SEVERAL WAYS TO BUILD POWERFUL RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS
YOU1000000118_S0000039	RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS ARE HOW YOU BUILD PERSONALIZED ALGORITHMS
YOU1000000118_S0000040	AND SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT MOST ENGINEERS BUILD AT SOME POINT IN THEIR CAREERS
YOU1000000118_S0000041	IN FACT IT MIGHT BE THE ONLY SYSTEM THAT MANY PEOPLE WILL BUILD
YOU1000000118_S0000042	BUT IN ORDER TO BUILD POWERFUL RECOMMENDATION ENGINES IT TURNS OUT THAT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND TOOLS AND TRICKS
YOU1000000118_S0000043	THAT ARE BORROWED FROM IMAGES AND FROM SEQUENCES
YOU1000000118_S0000044	SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE LOOKING AT THEM IN THIS ORDER AND THAT'S WHY WE LOOK AT RECOMMENDATION ENGINES PRETTY MUCH AT THE END OF THE SPECIALIZATION
YOU1000000118_S0000045	NOW YOU MAY HAVE ENCOUNTERED SOME OF THIS MATERIAL BEFORE ESPECIALLY IN THE FIRST FOUR COURSES
YOU1000000118_S0000046	FOR EXAMPLE IN THE COURSES ON CREATING MACHINE LEARNING DATASETS
YOU1000000118_S0000047	AND ON TENSERFLOW BASICS SOME OF THE SLIDES WILL BE A REPEAT OF SERVERLESS MACHINE LEARNING WITH TENSERFLOW THAT'S AVAILABLE IN COURSERA
YOU1000000118_S0000048	SIMILARLY IF YOU ENCOUNTERED GOOGLE'S MACHINE LEARNING CRASH COURSE THIS IS AN INTERNAL GOOGLE COURSE BUT IT HAS ALSO BEEN TAUGHT ON SOME UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES
YOU1000000118_S0000049	YOU MIGHT FIND SOME OF THE MATERIAL IN FEATURE REPRESENTATION AND ART AND SIGNS OF TO BE FAMILIAR
YOU1000000118_S0000051	IN SPITE OF THIS THOUGH THE DETAILS ARE QUITE DIFFERENT SO DON'T SKIP IT COMPLETELY
YOU1000000118_S0000052	TREAT THESE COURSES AS A USEFUL REFRESHER AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU STILL REMEMBER THE IDEAS PRESENTED IN THOSE SECTIONS
YOU1000000119_S0000001	WELCOME TO THE FIRST COURSE IN THE BLOCKCHAIN SPECIALIZATION TITLED BLOCKCHAIN BASICS
YOU1000000119_S0000002	LET'S START BY ASKING OURSELVES WHAT IS A BLOCKCHAIN WHY SHOULD YOU CARE ABOUT IT
YOU1000000119_S0000003	UNLIKE TRADITIONAL METHODS BLOCKCHAIN ENABLES PEER TO PEER TRANSFER OF DIGITAL ASSETS WITHOUT ANY INTERMEDIARIES
YOU1000000119_S0000004	IT WAS A TECHNOLOGY ORIGINALLY CREATED TO SUPPORT THE FAMOUS CRYPTOCURRENCY BITCOIN
YOU1000000119_S0000005	THE BLOCKCHAIN BY ITSELF HAS TAKEN A LIFE OF ITS OWN AND PERMEATED A BROAD RANGE OF APPLICATIONS ACROSS MANY INDUSTRIES INCLUDING FINANCE HEALTHCARE GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION
YOU1000000119_S0000006	THE BLOCKCHAIN IS POISED TO INNOVATE AND TRANSFORM A WIDE RANGE OF APPLICATIONS INCLUDING GOODS TRANSFER FOR EXAMPLE SUPPLY CHAIN DIGITAL MEDIA TRANSFER FOR EXAMPLE SALE OF ART
YOU1000000119_S0000007	REMOTE SERVICES DELIVERY EXAMPLE TRAVEL AND TOURISM PLATFORM FOR DECENTRALIZED BUSINESS LOGIC FOR EXAMPLE MOVING COMPUTING TO DATA SOURCES
YOU1000000119_S0000008	AND DISTRIBUTED INTELLIGENCE EXAMPLE EDUCATION AND CREDENTIALING
YOU1000000119_S0000009	ADDITIONAL APPLICATIONS OF BLOCKCHAIN INCLUDE DISTRIBUTED RESOURCES FOR EXAMPLE POWER GENERATION AND DISTRIBUTION
YOU1000000119_S0000010	CROWDFUNDING FOR EXAMPLE STARTUP FUNDRAISING CROWD OPERATION FOR EXAMPLE ELECTRONIC VOTING IDENTITY MANAGEMENT FOR EXAMPLE ONE ID FOR ALL YOUR LIFE FUNCTIONS
YOU1000000119_S0000011	AND GOVERNMENT PUBLIC RECORDS AND OPEN GOVERNMENT
YOU1000000119_S0000013	MOREOVER BLOCKCHAIN CAN ENABLE AN INCLUSIVE ECONOMY IT CAN ENABLE A PERSON IN A REMOTE CORNER OF THE WORLD TO PARTAKE IN A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS
YOU1000000119_S0000014	OPPORTUNITIES FOR INNOVATIVE APPLICATIONS ARE ENDLESS
YOU1000000119_S0000015	THERE IS A DIRE NEED FOR CRITICAL THINKERS DESIGNERS AND DEVELOPERS WHO CAN ENVISION AND CREATE NEWER APPLICATION MODELS ON BLOCKCHAIN TO BENEFIT THE WORLD
YOU1000000119_S0000016	THIS COURSE IS A FIRST STEP IN ADDRESSING THIS NEED
YOU1000000119_S0000017	AT THE END OF THIS COURSE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN THE THREE FUNDAMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS THAT DEFINE THE BLOCKCHAIN USING BITCOIN BLOCKCHAIN
YOU1000000119_S0000018	BITCOIN IS NOT THE ONLY PLAYER IN TOWN BY THE END OF THE FIRST MODULE WE MOVE BEYOND BITCOIN INTO INTRODUCING THE NEXT GENERATION BLOCKCHAINS WITH ETHER
YOU1000000119_S0000020	YOU WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO DISCUSS THE IMPORTANT FEATURES OF ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN THAT IS USED AS A REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION IN MANY NEWER BLOCKCHAINS
YOU1000000119_S0000021	AND EXPLAIN THE ALGORITHMS AND TECHNIQUES THAT ENABLE THE BLOCKCHAIN INCLUDING A PUBLIC CRYPTOGRAPHY AND HASHING
YOU1000000119_S0000022	FINALLY YOU WILL BE ABLE TO OUTLINE METHODS FOR REALIZING TRUST IN A BLOCKCHAIN
YOU1000000119_S0000024	LET'S BEGIN WITH AN INTRODUCTION OF BITCOIN
YOU1000000119_S0000025	TWO MAJOR CONTRIBUTIONS OF CRYPTOCURRENCY BITCOIN ARE CONTINUOUSLY WORKING DIGITAL CURRENCY SYSTEM AND A MODEL FOR AUTONOMOUS DECENTRALIZED APPLICATION TECHNOLOGY CALLED THE BLOCKCHAIN
YOU1000000119_S0000027	THOUGH OUR FOCUS IS ON A GENERAL BLOCKCHAIN WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE WORKING OF THE TECHNOLOGY BEHIND BITCOIN TO FULLY APPRECIATE THE INNOVATION OF BLOCKCHAIN
YOU1000000119_S0000029	WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THE ADVENT OF THE INTERNET AND THE WORLD WIDE WEB HAS TRANSFORMED EVERY ASPECT OF OUR LIVES FROM STOCK MARKETS TO STREET CORNER FOOD TRUCKS
YOU1000000119_S0000030	IT HAS ENABLED TECHNOLOGY EXPLOSION WITH WEB TWO POINT AND THE WORLD OF ECOMMERCE APPLICATIONS
YOU1000000119_S0000031	AROUND TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TWO THOUSAND NINE WHEN THE INSTITUTIONS AND MARKETS WE TRUSTED WERE CRUMBLING DOWN AND EVERYBODY WAS RUNNING AWAY FROM THE WALL STREET
YOU1000000119_S0000032	A MYSTERIOUS PERSON OR PERSONS CALLED SATOSHI NAKAMOTO INTRODUCED A NEW DIGITAL CURRENCY CRYPTO CURRENCY CALLED BITCOIN
YOU1000000119_S0000034	BITCOIN ENABLED AN INNOVATIVE PLATFORM FOR PEER TO PEER TRANSFER OF VALUE WITHOUT ANY CENTRAL AUTHORITY
YOU1000000119_S0000036	WITH NO CENTRAL AUTHORITY HOW DID BITCOIN REALIZE TRUST AND SECURITY
YOU1000000119_S0000037	BY IMPLEMENTING SOFTWARE PROGRAMS FOR VALIDATION VERIFICATION CONSENSUS IN A NOVEL INFRASTRUCTURE CALLED THE
YOU1000000119_S0000039	LATER ON IN ABOUT TWENTY TWELVE TWENTY THIRTEEN COMPUTATIONAL ELEMENTS WERE ADDED TO THE BLOCKCHAIN INFRASTRUCTURE
YOU1000000119_S0000040	THAT HAS OPENED UP A WHOLE WORLD OF POSSIBILITIES BEYOND SIMPLE CURRENCY TRANSFER
YOU1000000119_S0000041	THESE INNOVATIONS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY SHAPING THE DIRECTION OF WEB THREE POINT AS YOU WILL LEARN IN THE NEXT FOUR COURSE
YOU1000000119_S0000043	WHAT IS A BLOCKCHAIN BLOCKCHAIN IS ABOUT ENABLING PEER TO PEER TRANSACTIONS IN A DECENTRALIZED NETWORK
YOU1000000119_S0000044	ESTABLISHING TRUST AMONG UNKNOWN PEERS
YOU1000000119_S0000045	RECORDING THE TRANSACTION IN AN IMMUTABLE DISTRIBUTED LEDGER
YOU1000000119_S0000047	LET'S UNDERSTAND CENTRALIZED VERSUS DECENTRALIZED NETWORK USING A COMMON SCENARIO
YOU1000000119_S0000048	CONSIDER A SCENARIO WHERE A CUSTOMER WANTS TO BUY AN ITEM USING HER CREDIT CARD
YOU1000000119_S0000050	LET'S ENUMERATE THE INTERMEDIARIES INVOLVED IN ACCOMPLISHING THIS TASK
YOU1000000119_S0000051	WE HAVE A CREDIT CARD AGENCY WE HAVE A CUSTOMER BANK WE HAVE A CREDIT CARD BANK WE HAVE AN EXCHANGE WE HAVE THE MERCHANTSBANK AND FINALLY THE MERCHANT
YOU1000000119_S0000053	THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A CENTRALIZED SYSTEM THAT WE ARE SO USED TO
YOU1000000119_S0000054	NOW COMPARE THIS WITH A SYSTEM WHERE PEERS CAN TRANSACT DIRECTLY WITH EACH OTHER IRRESPECTIVE OF WHERE THEY ARE LOCATED
YOU1000000119_S0000056	FUNCTIONS OF THE INTERMEDIARIES ARE SHIFTED TO THE PERIPHERY TO THE PEER PARTICIPANT IN THE BLOCKCHAIN INFRASTRUCTURE
YOU1000000119_S0000057	ARE NOT NECESSARILY KNOWN TO EACH OTHER THIS IS A DECENTRALIZED SYSTEM
YOU1000000119_S0000058	HOW DO WE ESTABLISH TRUST AMONG THE PEERS IN SUCH A DECENTRALIZED SYSTEM
YOU1000000119_S0000059	BY HAVING A PROCESS IN PLACE TO VALIDATE VERIFY AND CONFIRM TRANSACTIONS
YOU1000000119_S0000060	RECORD THE TRANSACTION IN A DISTRIBUTED LEDGER OF BLOCKS
YOU1000000119_S0000061	CREATE A TAMPER PROOF RECORD OF BLOCK CHAIN OF BLOCKS
YOU1000000119_S0000063	AND IMPLEMENT A CONSENSUS PROTOCOL FOR AGREEMENT ON THE BLOCK TO BE ADDED TO THE CHAIN
YOU1000000119_S0000064	SO VALIDATION VERIFICATION CONSENSUS AND IMMUTABLE RECORDING LEAD TO THE TRUST AND SECURITY OF THE BLOCKCHAIN
YOU1000000119_S0000066	NOW I'LL EXPLAIN THESE CONCEPTS USING ANOTHER SCENARIO
YOU1000000119_S0000068	I'M LENDING AMY TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS THIS IS ONE SINGLE PEER TO PEER TRANSACTION
YOU1000000119_S0000069	WE BOTH MAKE A NOTE OF IT ON A LEDGER
YOU1000000119_S0000070	WHAT IF I CHANGE MY ENTRY FROM TEN THOUSAND TO ELEVEN THOUSAND
YOU1000000119_S0000071	ALTERNATIVELY AMY CHANGES HER FROM TEN THOUSAND TO ONE THOUSAND
YOU1000000119_S0000072	TO PREVENT THIS TRUST VIOLATION WE NEED TO SEEK THE HELP OF PEOPLE AROUND US LISA ALISON AND FRANCIS
YOU1000000119_S0000073	PROVIDE ALL OF THEM A VALID COPY OF THIS LETTER
YOU1000000119_S0000074	THIS IS THE BASIC CONCEPT OF AN IMMUTABLE DISTRIBUTED LEDGER DEFINED IN A BLOCKCHAIN PROCESS
YOU1000000119_S0000076	IN THIS SCENARIO WE WERE ALL PHYSICALLY PRESENT IN ONE LOCATION AMHERST
YOU1000000119_S0000077	NOW IMAGINE THIS TO BE AN ONLINE TRANSACTION
YOU1000000119_S0000078	TO AN UNKNOWN PEER ALSO SCALE UP THE ONE TRANSACTION TO TEN THOUSAND TRANSACTIONS HOW ABOUT A MILLION TRANSACTIONS
YOU1000000119_S0000079	I SHOULD BE ABLE TO TRANSACT WITH EQUAL EASE TO ANY UNKNOWN PEER IN AMHERST ALBANY OR ALBANIA
YOU1000000119_S0000080	MAYBE TO SEND SOME FLOWERS TO A FRIEND IN ALBANIA THIS IS THE TENET OF A DECENTRALIZED SYSTEM SUPPORTED BY BLOCKCHAIN
YOU1000000119_S0000082	IN THE CASE JUST DESCRIBED HOW DO WE TRUST OUR UNKNOWN PEERS
YOU1000000119_S0000083	THROUGH VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION IN OUR EXAMPLE AMY REQUESTS EVEN TO VERIFY THE AMOUNT I TRANSACTED WITH
YOU1000000119_S0000085	KEVIN CHECKS IT IS KEVIN FINDS THE AMOUNT OF TRANSACTION IS NOT TEN THOUSAND BUT THREE HUNDRED NOT VALID
YOU1000000119_S0000086	KEVIN REJECTS AND NULLIFIES THE TRANSACTION SIMILAR TO THIS VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION METHODS DEFINED BY THE BLOCKCHAIN
YOU1000000119_S0000087	AND IMPLEMENTED BY THE PEERS PROVIDE THE COLLECTIVE TRUST NEEDED IN A DECENTRALIZED SYSTEM
YOU1000000119_S0000088	SUMMARIZING BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY SUPPORTS METHODS FOR A DECENTRALIZED PEER TO PEER SYSTEM A COLLECTIVE TRUST MODEL
YOU1000000119_S0000089	AND THE DISTRIBUTED IMMUTABLE LEDGER OF RECORDS OF TRANSACTIONS
YOU1000000120_S0000001

YOU1000000121_S0000001	FROM THE SIDE I'M STEPPING BACK ON MY RIGHT LEG FOR A DOUBLE BOUNCE ONE TWO AND THEN LEFT
YOU1000000121_S0000002	ONE TWO ONE TWO ONE TWO
YOU1000000121_S0000003	SO ESSENTIALLY WHAT I'M DOING HERE IS JUST SWITCHING THE FEET AND FROM THE BACK STARTING ON THE RIGHT LEG FOR DOUBLE BOUNCE

YOU1000000121_S0000009	SO JUST BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU'RE IN THIS POSITION HERE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR WEIGHT ON THAT FRONT FOOT BECAUSE WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING IS THE STEP LOOKS LIKE SALSA
YOU1000000121_S0000010	SO WE WANT TO BRING THE WEIGHT BACK SINK DOWN INTO THAT BACK LEG
YOU1000000121_S0000011	SO WHEN I TAKE MY RIGHT LEG BACK MY WEIGHT COMES INTO MY RIGHT HIP I SHOULD BE ABLE TO LIFT UP THAT FRONT FOOT
YOU1000000121_S0000012	BECAUSE ALL OF MY WEIGHT IS IN THE BACK LEG SO WITH SAMBA YOU ALWAYS WANT TO IMAGINE LIKE YOU'RE DOING A SQUAT OR YOU'RE SITTING DOWN ON A CHAIR
YOU1000000121_S0000013	SHOULDERS ARE BACK AND WEIGHT IS ALWAYS BACKWARDS SO IF WE START WITH OUR RIGHT LEG BACK FOR OUR DOUBLE BOUNDS
YOU1000000121_S0000014	WE DON'T WANT TO BRING THE WEIGHT FORWARD SO BACK
YOU1000000121_S0000016	AND BACK
YOU1000000121_S0000018	BACK
YOU1000000121_S0000020	AND BACK

YOU1000000121_S0000025	WHICH SWITCH SWITCH LET'S TRY FROM THE SIDE SO YOU CAN SEE MY FEET
YOU1000000121_S0000027	SWITCH SWITCH DOUBLE BOUNCE

YOU1000000121_S0000033	ONE TWO ONE TWO ONE TWO OKAY SO THAT'S OUR BASIC STEP
YOU1000000121_S0000034	NOW WE'RE GOING TO ADD ARMS TO THIS STEP SO WHEN I STEP BACK ON THE RIGHT LEG I'M GOING TO BEND MY RIGHT ARM
YOU1000000121_S0000035	SO FROM THE BACK STEPPING BACK ON THE RIGHT LEG BENDING THE RIGHT ARM
YOU1000000121_S0000036	WHEN I STEP BACK ON THE LEFT LEG I BEND MY LEFT ARM
YOU1000000121_S0000037	RIGHT LEG RIGHT ARM LEFT LEG LEFT ARM
YOU1000000121_S0000038	SO LET'S TRY THIS FROM THE FRONT BACK ON THE RIGHT LEG BENDING THE RIGHT ARM BACK ON THE LEFT LEG BENDING THE LEFT ARM

YOU1000000121_S0000081	RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT AND LEFT
YOU1000000122_S0000001	TAKE A LOOK AT THESE TWO PHOTOS OF OUTER SPACE WHAT DO YOU SEE THEY'RE BASICALLY IDENTICAL BUT NOT QUITE NOW LOOK A DIFFERENT WAY IN SEQUENCE
YOU1000000122_S0000002	HERE YOU SEE SOMETHING DIFFERENT SOMETHING MOVING THAT DOT IS A NEWLY DISCOVERED WORLD IT'S CLOSER THAN WE EVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE
YOU1000000122_S0000003	AND THE TRICK WE USE TO FIND IT COULD REWRITE THE STORY OF OUR COSMIC NEIGHBOURHOOD
YOU1000000122_S0000005	TODAY SCIENTISTS HAVE OUR SOLAR SYSTEM PRETTY WELL MAPPED OUT WE KNOW ABOUT THE EIGHT PLANETS PLUTO MOONS ASTEROIDS COMETS
YOU1000000122_S0000006	AND UNTIL RECENTLY WE THOUGHT WE HAD A HANDLE ON OUR SOLAR NEIGHBORHOOD TOO
YOU1000000122_S0000008	THERE'S THE ALPHA CENTAURI SYSTEM ABOUT FOUR LIGHT YEARS AWAY AND BARNARD'S STAR A RED DWARF A LITTLE FARTHER OUT
YOU1000000122_S0000009	ASTRONOMERS MADE THESE DISCOVERIES MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO
YOU1000000122_S0000010	BUT TODAY SOME NEW WORK IS TOTALLY UPENDING OUR VIEW OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD IT INVOLVES A SPACE TELESCOPE AN ARMY OF VOLUNTEERS AND A SCIENTIST ON A VERY SPECIFIC MISSION
YOU1000000122_S0000011	MY NAME IS JACKIE FERDY AND I'M AN ASTROPHYSICIST AT THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY
YOU1000000122_S0000012	JACQUIE HAS SPENT FIFTEEN YEARS SEARCHING OUR SOLAR NEIGHBOURHOOD FOR NEW NEIGHBORS
YOU1000000122_S0000013	SHE'S FOCUSED ON MYSTERIOUS WORLDS KNOWN AS BROWN DWARFS BALLS OF GAS THAT ARE TOO BIG TO BE PLANETS BUT TOO SMALL TO BE STARS
YOU1000000122_S0000014	NOW THEY'RE THEY'RE OFTEN CALLED FAILED STARS BUT I REALLY DISLIKE THE WORD FAILURE IN THE TITLE
YOU1000000122_S0000015	BECAUSE I JUST FEEL LIKE IT'S KIND OF DEMEANING TO THE BROWN DWARF
YOU1000000122_S0000016	LIKE IT NEEDS TO BE A STAR IT DOESN'T CARE AND SO OFTENTIMES I CALL THEM OVEREXCITED PLANETS
YOU1000000122_S0000017	BROWN DWARFS WOULD BE STARS IF THEY WERE MORE MASSIVE BUT WITHOUT ENOUGH HYDROGEN THEY DON'T ACHIEVE NUCLEAR FUSION
YOU1000000122_S0000018	THEY EMIT LOTS OF INFRARED ENERGY BUT VERY LITTLE VISIBLE LIGHT
YOU1000000122_S0000019	SO FOR A LONG TIME THEY WERE HIDDEN TO ASTRONOMERS BUT THAT ALL CHANGED IN THE NINETY S
YOU1000000122_S0000020	INFRARED TECHNOLOGY AND INFRARED TELESCOPES STARTED TO COME ONLINE IN EARNEST AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS YOU START TO SEE THESE SKY SURVEYS
YOU1000000122_S0000021	THAT ARE ABLE TO PRODUCE THE WAVELENGTHS WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THE BROWN DWARFS
YOU1000000122_S0000022	THE FIRST BROWN DWARFS WERE IDED AROUND NINETY NINETY FIVE AND SINCE THEN THE FIELD HAS EXPLODED
YOU1000000122_S0000023	TODAY THE ASTRONOMY COMMUNITY IS A WASH IN IMAGERY THAT COULD HARBOR NEARBY BROWN DWARFS
YOU1000000122_S0000024	ACTUALLY FINDING THEM IS ANOTHER STORY BUT THERE'S AN OLD TECHNIQUE CALLED THE BLINK METHOD THAT WORKS WONDERS
YOU1000000122_S0000025	THE BASIC IDEA IS THAT ALL STARS ARE IN MOTION RELATIVE TO US MOST ARE SO FAR AWAY THAT THEY MOVE IMPERCEPTIBLY
YOU1000000122_S0000026	BUT OBJECTS IN OUR SOLAR NEIGHBOURHOOD THOSE ARE CLOSE ENOUGH THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY CATCH THEIR MOVEMENT IF WE'RE PATIENT ENOUGH
YOU1000000122_S0000027	HERE ARE FOUR IMAGES TAKEN WITH VARIOUS TELESCOPES OVER A SPAN OF THIRTY TWO YEARS
YOU1000000122_S0000028	IF YOU FLIP OR BLINK THROUGH THEM YOU SEE THAT NOT EVERYTHING IS STAYING PUT
YOU1000000122_S0000029	OBJECTS OF INTEREST THAT ARE IN THE NEARBY VICINITY THEY WILL MOVE THEY WILL JUMP AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF STARS
YOU1000000122_S0000030	THAT IS LUMIN SIXTEEN A PAIR OF BROWN DWARFS THAT'S ONLY SIX AND A HALF LIGHT YEARS FROM EARTH IT WAS DISCOVERED USING THE BLINK METHOD IN TWENTY THIRTEEN
YOU1000000122_S0000031	AND IT'S NOW THE THIRD CLOSEST KNOWN SYSTEM TO OURS
YOU1000000122_S0000032	WE HAD NOT CHANGED THAT LIST OF OBJECTS IN THE TOP FIVE IN A CENTURY IT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN
YOU1000000122_S0000033	WE SHOULD NOT BE FINDING OBJECTS ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT ARE SPITTING DISTANCE AWAY FROM US THAT WE'VE BEEN MISSING ALL THIS TIME
YOU1000000122_S0000034	THE BLINK METHOD ISN'T NEW CLYDE TOMBA USED IT TO DISCOVER PLUTO BACK IN NINETEEN THIRTY AND IT'S BEEN USED TO DISCOVER MOONS ASTEROIDS AND DWARF PLANETS
YOU1000000122_S0000035	BUT PAIRED WITH NEW INFRARED IMAGERY IT'S SLOWLY BRINGING OUR NEIGHBORHOOD INTO FOCUS A LITTLE TOO SLOWLY REALLY
YOU1000000122_S0000036	A FEW YEARS BACK JACQUIE FOUND HERSELF STARING DOWN MILLIONS OF IMAGES THAT COULD CONTAIN NEW DISCOVERIES IT WAS DAUNTING
YOU1000000122_S0000037	I AM SPENDING HOURS OF MY TIME EVERY WEEK BLINKING IMAGES IN LIKE MY SPARE TIME
YOU1000000122_S0000038	AND I CAN'T IT'S JUST AS FRUSTRATING AS TAKING TOO MUCH TIME AND I'LL NEVER GET THROUGH ALL OF IT
YOU1000000122_S0000039	THE IMAGES ARE NOISY AND BLURRY AND EACH ONE NEEDED REAL ATTENTION IT WAS FAR TOO MUCH FOR ANY TEAM TO HANDLE
YOU1000000122_S0000041	UNLESS THAT TEAM WERE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
YOU1000000122_S0000042	AND SO THUS SPRUNG OUR CITIZEN SCIENCE PROJECT
YOU1000000122_S0000043	AT THE BEGINNING MY GIRLFRIEND DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY I WAS LOOKING FOR JUST BUNCH OF MOVING PIXELS FOR HOURS
YOU1000000122_S0000044	STARTING IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN JACQUIE AND HER TEAM INVITED THE ENTIRE INTERNET TO GO HUNTING FOR BROWN DWARFS
YOU1000000122_S0000045	THEIR SYSTEM IS DEAD SIMPLE USERS LOG INTO A WEBSITE AND MEET THEIR FIRST ASTRONOMY FLIPBOOK
YOU1000000122_S0000046	THE IMAGES COME IN A SEQUENCE OF FOUR AND IT WILL FLIP THOSE IMAGES FLIP THROUGH TIME SO IT SHOWS YOU WHAT THIS POINT IN SPACE LOOKED LIKE
YOU1000000122_S0000047	AND THIS YEAR AND THEN A LITTLE BIT AFTER AND THEN A LITTLE AFTER AND THEN A LITTLE AFTER
YOU1000000122_S0000048	YOU'LL KIND OF SEE BLUE AND ORANGE DOTS TYPICALLY THAT ARE EVERYWHERE
YOU1000000122_S0000049	IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE STARING AT COLORFUL TELEVISION STATIC
YOU1000000122_S0000050	CAN BE KIND OF ANNOYING AT FIRST IF YOU DON'T QUITE KNOW WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
YOU1000000122_S0000051	BUT IF YOU'RE LUCKY YOU'LL CATCH A MOVER
YOU1000000122_S0000052	WHEN YOU FINALLY FIND SOMETHING MOVING IT'S A BIT OF ADRENALINE RUSH
YOU1000000122_S0000053	FASTER MOVING OBJECTS ACTUALLY DO BLINK ACROSS THE SCREEN SLOWER ONES MIGHT JUST TWINKLE
YOU1000000122_S0000054	THEY'RE BASICALLY THESE LITTLE TINY LIKE WHITE DOTS THAT WILL FLASH WHEN YOU PLAY OR FLIP BOOKS
YOU1000000122_S0000055	EITHER WAY YOU CAN MARK YOUR ANOMALY AND ALERT THE COMMUNITY
YOU1000000122_S0000057	I THINK I FOUND SOMETHING AND EVERYONE ELSE KIND OF LIKE YEAH YEAH THAT'S ONE IT'S LIKE YES I'M GOOD I FOUND SOMETHING
YOU1000000122_S0000058	THE MOST PROMISING LEADS END UP ON JACQUIE'S RADAR HER TEAM CAN THEN BOOK TELESCOPE TIME TO LOOK MORE CLOSELY FOR YOU CITIZEN SCIENTIST IT'S BACK TO BLINKING
YOU1000000122_S0000059	IT'S LIKE IN A WORD IT'S LIKE A TREASURE HUNT IN YOUR COUCH IT'S REALLY SOMETHING THAT KEEPS YOU HOOKED
YOU1000000122_S0000060	SINCE BACKYARD WORLD LAUNCHED VOLUNTEERS HAVE BEEN ON A TEAR
YOU1000000122_S0000061	THEY'VE DISCOVERED HUNDREDS HUNDREDS OF NEARBY OBJECTS
YOU1000000122_S0000062	SOME WERE A NOVEL KIND OF COMPACT FROZEN WORLD
YOU1000000122_S0000063	PRIOR TO BACKYARD WORLDS THERE WAS ONLY TWENTY FOUR OF THEM KNOWN THEY ADDED FIVE NEW ONES
YOU1000000122_S0000064	OTHERS HAD SURPRISING NEW ATMOSPHERES
YOU1000000122_S0000065	REALLY STRANGE LOOKING OBJECTS
YOU1000000122_S0000066	AND STILL OTHERS WERE HIDDEN SIBLINGS OF KNOWN OBJECTS
YOU1000000122_S0000067	I HAD CERTAINLY STUDIED THE BROWN DWARF IN THE SYSTEM A LOT IN PREVIOUS WORK AND NEVER DID I GUESS THAT IT HAD A LITTLE COLD COMPANION WITH IT
YOU1000000122_S0000068	ALL IN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF USERS HAVE FOUND MORE THAN FIFTEEN HUNDRED NEW OBJECTS
YOU1000000122_S0000069	VOLUNTEERS LIKE DAN AND I HAVE GOTTEN CREDITS IN ACADEMIC PAPERS FOR THEIR DISCOVERIES
YOU1000000122_S0000070	THERE'S STILL MORE TO FIND JACQUIE THINKS THE EFFORT COULD REVEAL A BROWN DWARF EVEN CLOSER THAN ALPHA CENTAURI
YOU1000000122_S0000071	A NEW NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR THERE'S EVEN A CHANCE WE COULD FIND THE BIG FOOT OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM PLANET NINE
YOU1000000122_S0000072	THERE IS AN OBJECT THAT'S THEORIZED TO EXIST BEYOND PLUTO THAT IS MASSIVE THAT IT COULD BE CAUSING SOME OBJECTS IN THE OUTER SOLAR SYSTEM TO BE BUMPED AROUND A BIT
YOU1000000122_S0000073	AND IT'S IT'S AN EXCITING PROSPECT NOW DOES IT EXIST I DON'T KNOW I'M HAPPY THAT WE HAVE CITIZENS THAT ARE VERY INTERESTED IN TRYING TO FIND IT
YOU1000000122_S0000074	IF IT'S REAL IF IT'S THERE AND MAYBE IT IS
YOU1000000122_S0000076	AS SUCCESSFUL AS THE BLINK METHOD IS IT HAS COMPETITION ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE HAS BEEN HUGE FOR ASTRONOMERS WHO NEED TO SIFT THROUGH TONS OF IMAGERY INCLUDING JACKIE
YOU1000000122_S0000077	THE HUMAN EYE IS BEAUTIFUL AT PICKING OUT THINGS
YOU1000000122_S0000078	IT'S JUST SLOW BECAUSE WE HAVE TO GO IMAGE BY IMAGE AND SO HUMAN EYE WINS AND IN SOME WAYS BUT AI WINS IN SPEED SO I USE BOTH
YOU1000000122_S0000079	ONE LIMITATION OF AI IS THAT IT NEEDS TO TRAIN USING EXAMPLES OF THINGS THAT IT'S LOOKING FOR SO IF THAT THING IS BRAND NEW HUMAN BRAINS HAVE THE EDGE
YOU1000000122_S0000080	YOU ARE THE TRAINED ALGORITHM AT THAT POINT
YOU1000000122_S0000081	THAT SAID ASTRONOMY IS FACING A TOTAL WAVE OF DATA
YOU1000000122_S0000082	IN A COUPLE YEARS ASTRONOMERS WILL BEGIN IMAGING THE ENTIRE NIGHT SKY OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE TWICE A WEEK
YOU1000000122_S0000083	THERE IS NO WAY WE ARE LOOKING THROUGH ALL OF THE DATA IN THE CLASSIC WAYS IN THE COMING FUTURE LIKE IT'S OVER
YOU1000000122_S0000084	FOR NOW JACQUIE WILL TAKE ALL THE HELP SHE CAN GET FROM HUMAN VOLUNTEERS TO ALGORITHMS THE HUMANS ARE MORE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT IT
YOU1000000122_S0000085	YOU SPEND COUNTLESS HOURS PORING THROUGH IMAGES AND DESIGNING CUSTOM ALGORITHMS AND SERVICES AND YOU GET SOMETHING GREAT
YOU1000000122_S0000086	IT'S SUPER EXCITING TO SEE THAT ALL OF THIS WORK THAT WE PUT IN HAS AN IMPACT
YOU1000000122_S0000087	YOU CAN SAY TO YOURSELF YEAH IT'S IT'S SOMETHING I SAW
YOU1000000122_S0000088	AND I'M THE FIRST HUMAN BEING TO IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND TO TO SEE IT IT'S IT'S A GREAT FEELING
YOU1000000122_S0000090	THANK YOU TO LEXUS FOR THEIR SUPPORT BE SURE TO CHECK OUT THE NEW LEXUS IS BY GOING TO LEXUS DOT COM SLASH IS
YOU1000000122_S0000091	THEIR CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT GOING ALL IN ON YOUR PASSION AND GETTING A GREATER REWARD WHICH IS WHY THEY SPONSORED THIS SERIES ON RESEARCHERS AND INNOVATORS
YOU1000000122_S0000092	THEY DON'T INFLUENCE OUR EDITORIAL BUT THEY DO HELP MAKE VIDEOS LIKE THIS VIABLE SO THANKS AGAIN TO THEM AND THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
YOU1000000123_S0000000	SO WHAT SHALL HOW SHALL I BEGIN THIS IS THE VERB FOR THE COURSE
YOU1000000123_S0000001	VERB THAT'S BEEN IN THE YALE CATALOG FOR A LONG TIME THIS IS A COURSE ON FINANCE
YOU1000000123_S0000002	IT HAS THE WORD MARKETS IN THE NAME WHICH SUGGESTS THAT IT'S ABOUT TRADING
YOU1000000123_S0000004	
YOU1000000123_S0000006	BUT I THINK IT'S A BROAD COURSE IN FINANCE
YOU1000000123_S0000007	SO THE BLURB SAYS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE A PILLAR OF CIVILIZED SOCIETY
YOU1000000123_S0000008	DIRECTING RESOURCES ACROSS SPACE AND TIME TO THEIR BEST USES SO THIS SOUNDS BROADER I GUESS THE COURSE IS BROADER
YOU1000000123_S0000009	I WROTE THE TITLE OF THE COURSE MANY YEARS AGO WHEN I CREATED THIS COURSE
YOU1000000123_S0000010	AND IT'S BEEN A TITLE FOR IT BUT
YOU1000000123_S0000012	SEE WHAT REALLY TO ME THIS COURSE IS ABOUT IS HOW WE GET THINGS DONE IN OUR SOCIETY
YOU1000000123_S0000013	THAT'S HOW WE INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO DO THINGS NOW MOST OF US ARE IN OUR LIVES THINKING ABOUT OURSELVES
YOU1000000123_S0000014	THAT'S HUMAN NATURE AND ABOUT OUR PARTICULAR
YOU1000000123_S0000016	PLACE IN THE LIFECYCLE SO YOU MAY BE A YOUNG PERSON WHO'S THINKING ABOUT GETTING STARTED IN LIFE
YOU1000000123_S0000017	BUT WHEN YOU JOIN AN ENTERPRISE OR AN ORGANIZATION YOU HAVE TO DO THINGS FOR THE ORGANIZATION
YOU1000000123_S0000018	YOU HAVE TO TAKE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE
YOU1000000123_S0000020	YOU HAVE TO HELP MANAGE A PRODUCTIVE VENTURE THAT INVOLVES MANY PEOPLE SO THERE AREN'T THAT MANY THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO AS AN INDIVIDUAL
YOU1000000123_S0000021	THAT ARE USEFUL YOU HAVE TO JOIN AN ORGANIZATION THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF HUMAN LIFE
YOU1000000123_S0000023	SO THIS IS OF COURSE ABOUT UNDERSTANDING HOW THE INSTITUTIONS WORK AND HOW WE CAN PREDICT WHAT WILL HAPPEN
YOU1000000123_S0000025	AND THINGS ARE RAPIDLY CHANGING IN THE INFORMATION AGE THAT WE LIVE IN NOW
YOU1000000123_S0000027	THAT'S WHAT THIS COURSE IS ABOUT I DON'T CONSIDER WELL I DON'T CONSIDER THIS A VOCATIONAL COURSE
YOU1000000123_S0000028	BECAUSE I THINK IT SHOULD BE OF INTEREST TO ANYBODY WHO WHO IS INTERESTED IN HOW THINGS WORK
YOU1000000123_S0000030	ON THE OTHER HAND THIS COURSE
YOU1000000123_S0000032	COMES ACROSS AS MORE VOCATIONAL THAN MOST YALE COURSES AND TO SOME EXTENT I PRIDE MYSELF ON THAT
YOU1000000123_S0000033	ALTHOUGH I CONSIDER MYSELF AN INTELLECTUAL BUT THIS IS A RELEVANT COURSE RIGHT IT'S NOT ABOUT HOW TO MAKE MONEY
YOU1000000123_S0000034	YOU MIGHT SAY IT IS I SUPPOSE BUT IT'S ABOUT MAKING THINGS WORK
YOU1000000123_S0000036	THESE ARE THE TOPICS IN THIS COURSE SO RISK INSURANCE DIVERSIFICATION HISTORY OF FINANCE INNOVATION EFFICIENT MARKETS BEHAVIORAL FINANCE
YOU1000000123_S0000037	ACTUALLY BEHAVIORAL FINANCE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE PROMINENT THAN YOU MIGHT THINK FROM ITS APPEARANCE AS NUMBER SEVEN ON THIS LIST
YOU1000000123_S0000038	BEHAVIORAL FINANCE IS THE APPLICATION OF PSYCHOLOGY SOCIOLOGY OTHER SOCIAL SCIENCES TO UNDERSTANDING FINANCIAL EVENTS
YOU1000000123_S0000040	IT'S A REVOLUTION IN FINANCE THAT I HAVE WATCHED OVER THE WHOLE COURSE OF IT BECAUSE I HAVE ORGANIZED CONFERENCES ON BEHAVIORAL FINANCE
YOU1000000123_S0000041	STARTING IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE WORKING WITH RICHARD THALER AT UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO
YOU1000000123_S0000042	WE JUST WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS BUT WE JUST BEQUEATHED IT THERE ARE REGULAR SEMINARS OF PROFESSORS
YOU1000000123_S0000043	TO NICK BARBARIC HERE AT THE YALE SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT
YOU1000000123_S0000045	BUT WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT BECAUSE I KIND OF BELIEVE IN A UNITY OF KNOWLEDGE
YOU1000000123_S0000046	SO THIS COURSE WILL DIFFER FROM MANY OTHER FINANCE COURSES AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT REAL PEOPLE AND HOW THINGS REALLY WORK
YOU1000000123_S0000048	
YOU1000000123_S0000050	WE TALK ABOUT DEBT THE STOCK MARKET THE REAL ESTATE MARKET REGULATION BY THE WAY REGULATION IS AN INTEREST OF MINE TOO
YOU1000000123_S0000051	MORE SO THAN MOST PEOPLE WHO TEACH FINANCE BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE MARKETS NEED TO BE REGULATED
YOU1000000123_S0000052	HUMAN BEINGS HAVE A TENDENCY TO BE MANIPULATIVE AND TRICKY AND FINANCE IS USED TO TRICK PEOPLE
YOU1000000123_S0000053	THAT'S WHY WE NEED REGULATORS SO YOU SHOULDN'T ASSUME THAT I WANT TO SEND YOU OFF TO WALL STREET
YOU1000000123_S0000054	I THINK THAT YOU MIGHT GO TO BE A MEMBER OF THE LIKE THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION OR SOMETHING ELSE AS A JOB
YOU1000000123_S0000055	AND BE PROUD OF IT OK IT'S IMPORTANT
YOU1000000123_S0000057	THE BANKING FUTURES FUTURES MARKET HAS A SPECIAL MEANING IN FINANCE
YOU1000000123_S0000058	MONETARY POLICY ENDOWMENT MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT BANKING OPTIONS MONEY MANAGERS EXCHANGES PUBLIC FINANCE
YOU1000000123_S0000059	NONPROFITS AND FINALLY THAT LAST LECTURE WILL BE ON THE PURPOSE OF ALL THIS
YOU1000000123_S0000060	SO THAT'S THIS COURSE
YOU1000000123_S0000062	I WANTED ALSO TO JUST REFLECT ON THE RELATIVE I SAID THIS COURSE LOOKS MORE VOCATIONAL
YOU1000000123_S0000063	IN A WAY BUT I DON'T CONSIDER THIS VOCATIONAL SCHOOL THIS IS
YOU1000000123_S0000065	I'D LIKE TO SAY USEFUL
YOU1000000123_S0000067	ONE THOUGHT PERSPECTIVE I WANTED TO GIVE YOU WAS HOW IMPORTANT IS FINANCE ANYWAY YOU UNLESS YOU GO INTO ACADEMIA
YOU1000000123_S0000068	YOU WILL GET A JOB SOMEWHERE IN THE REAL WORLD SO WHERE ARE THE JOBS
YOU1000000123_S0000069	I LOOKED UP ON THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS HAS A PUBLICATION OF THE U S GOVERNMENT ON THEIR WEBSITE
YOU1000000123_S0000070	THEY HAVE DATA ON JUST HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE IN DIFFERENT PROFESSIONS IN THE UNITED STATES
YOU1000000123_S0000071	AND THEY ALSO HAVE A FORECAST SO WHAT I'M SHOWING THE LATEST DATA IS FOR THE YEAR TWENTY FOURTEEN
YOU1000000123_S0000072	AND IT HAS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THOUSANDS AND THEN ALSO ON THERE WE HAVE THE PROJECTION FOR TWENTY TWENTY FOUR
YOU1000000123_S0000073	SO YOU NOTE THAT AT THE TOP I'VE GOT FINANCE THESE ARE SPECIFIC FINANCE PROFESSION NOT ALL FINANCE PROFESSIONS
YOU1000000123_S0000074	FINANCIAL ANALYSTS FINANCIAL MANAGERS PERSONAL FINANCIAL ADVISORS
YOU1000000123_S0000075	THEY ALL HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE BUT I WANTED YOU TO NOTE WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER MAJORS THAT YOU HAVE HERE I'M NOT DIMINISHING THEM
YOU1000000123_S0000076	ECONOMICS ECONOMISTS NOT SO MANY
YOU1000000123_S0000078	BUT YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN ASTRONOMY I ACTUALLY LOVE ASTRONOMY WHEN I WAS A KID I THOUGHT I'D BE AN ASTRONOMER
YOU1000000123_S0000079	I HAD TO REACH REALITY THERE'S LOTS OF EXCITING FIELDS
YOU1000000123_S0000080	WHERE THERE ARE ALMOST NO JOBS SO THERE'S HOW MANY ASTRONOMERS ARE THERE
YOU1000000123_S0000082	SOCIOLOGISTS POLITICAL SCIENTISTS OR MATHEMATICIANS THIS IS NOT TO DIMINISH YOUR MAJORING IN THOSE FIELDS
YOU1000000123_S0000083	YOU JUST DON'T EXPECT TO GET A JOB IN THOSE FIELDS
YOU1000000123_S0000084	I ALSO PUT DOWN AT THE BOTTOM MASSAGE THERAPIST OKAY I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WAS A PROFESSION
YOU1000000123_S0000085	BUT THERE'S PROJECTED TO BE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND MASSAGE THERAPISTS IN THE UNITED STATES IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR
YOU1000000123_S0000086	WE DON'T HAVE A MASSAGE THERAPY MAJOR HERE
YOU1000000123_S0000087	BUT THAT'S A SIGN OF OF
YOU1000000123_S0000089	HOW THE MARKET MAKES THINGS IMPORTANT
YOU1000000123_S0000090	RANA FARAHA MIGHT BE RIGHT ABOUT THIS THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH HAVING SO MANY FINANCE PEOPLE MAYBE WE NEED MORE MASSAGE THERAPISTS
YOU1000000123_S0000091	THE FINANCE PEOPLE
YOU1000000123_S0000092	BUT THERE'S A SENSE OF REALITY THAT I THINK THAT
YOU1000000123_S0000093	PART OF THE REASON THAT THERE'S SO MANY OF THEM IS THAT THEY DEAL WITH IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT CAN'T BE QUICKLY
YOU1000000123_S0000094	CAN'T BE MORE EASILY SOLVED WE NEED WE NEED ALL THESE PEOPLE THAT'S WHY I TAKE SOME PRIDE IN THIS COURSE IN BEING CONNECTED TO THE REAL WORLD
YOU1000000123_S0000095	THERE ARE REAL JOB OPPORTUNITIES IN FINANCE AND THERE'S ALSO I THINK IN THE NEW INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION PERIOD
YOU1000000123_S0000096	THEY WILL STILL BE I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE FIELDS THAT IS NOT GOING TO BE
YOU1000000123_S0000098	TOTALLY REPLACED BY COMPUTER THE PROBLEM WITH FINANCE IS THAT THE THE HIGH INEQUALITY IN THESE IN THESE IN THIS FIELD
YOU1000000123_S0000099	SOME PEOPLE MAKE A LOT OF MONEY BUT ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE TO GIVE IT AWAY THIS IS ANOTHER THING ABOUT THIS COURSE
YOU1000000123_S0000100	IF YOU MAKE A LOT OF MONEY IN FINANCE IT'S A GAME YOU ENJOYED IT NOW GIVE MOST OF IT AWAY THAT'S GOING TO BE A THEME
YOU1000000124_S0000000	LONG AND CUITOUS ROUTE ONLY ARRIVED AT THAT AGAIN
YOU1000000124_S0000002	SO THERE'S BEEN A BATTLE GOING ON FOR A LONG TIME ABOUT THE NATURE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND WHAT THIS NATURE SHOULD BE
YOU1000000124_S0000003	THERE'S TWO VERY DIFFERENT APPROACHES THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT IDEOLOGIES ONE IS INSPIRED BY LOGIC
YOU1000000124_S0000004	AND SO THE IDEA IS THAT THE ESSENCE OF INTELLIGENCE IS USING SYMBOLIC RULES TO MANIPULATE SYMBOLIC EXPRESSION
YOU1000000124_S0000005	AND THE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVED THIS OR PEOPLE WHO BELIEVED IT DIDN'T THINK THIS WAS EMPIRICAL THEY THOUGHT THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD HAVE INTELLIGENCE THEY THOUGHT IT WAS SORT OF NECESSARY TRUTH THAT THAT'S WHAT INTELLIGENCE WAS GOING TO BE
YOU1000000124_S0000007	THERE'S A DIFFERENT SET OF PEOPLE WHO WERE EQUALLY IDEOLOGICAL WHO BELIEVED THAT IF YOU WANT TO MAKE AN INTELLIGENT SYSTEM YOU SHOULD LOOK TO BIOLOGY
YOU1000000124_S0000008	AND IN PARTICULAR SHOULD TRY AND UNDERSTAND HOW THE BRAIN WAS DOING
YOU1000000124_S0000010	IT DOESN'T LOOK AS IF THE BRAINS OF ANIMALS ARE DOING IT BY LOGIC OF COURSE THERE'S ALL SORTS OF DEBATES ABOUT WHETHER ANIMALS ARE INTELLIGENT BUT
YOU1000000124_S0000012	BIOLOGICALLY INSPIRED PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT THE ESSENCE OF INTELLIGENCE WAS LEARNING THE CONNECTION STRING IN THE NEURAL NETWORK
YOU1000000124_S0000013	AND YOU CAN SEE THESE ARE TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WORLD VIEWS THEY KIND OF MISS EACH OTHER
YOU1000000124_S0000015	SO THERE WAS A BATTLE WENT ON FOR A LONG TIME IN THE NINETEEN SIXTY S WE HAD VERY SIMPLE NEURAL NETS AND WE HAD A SIMPLE LEARNING ALGORITHM
YOU1000000124_S0000017	THEY ONLY HAVE ONE LAYER OF FEATURES AND THEY WERE COMPLETELY WIPED OUT BY SYMBOLIC
YOU1000000124_S0000019	SO WHEN I STARTED IN GRADUATE SCHOOL IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTY S IT WAS WELL KNOWN THAT NEURAL NETWORKS WERE NONSENSE THEY WERE THE PAST THEY WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING AND IT HAS BEEN PROVED THAT THEY WERE USELESS
YOU1000000124_S0000021	THAT'S WHAT I WAS TOLD AND THAT'S WHAT ALMOST EVERYBODY NOW
YOU1000000124_S0000023	THEN IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY S
YOU1000000124_S0000025	VARIOUS GROUPS CAME UP WITH THE BACK PROPAGATION PROCEDURE AND THAT ALLOWED NEURAL NETWORKS TO LEARN MULTIPLE LAYERS OF FEATURES
YOU1000000124_S0000027	WE GOT OVER THIS PROBLEM THAT UNTIL THEN NEURAL NETWORKS JUST HAD HAND DESIGNED FEATURES THEY WAITED THOSE FEATURES TO MAKE A DECISION AND THEN THEY MADE A DECISION
YOU1000000124_S0000028	THEY DIDN'T LEARN THEIR OWN FEATURES WITH THAT PROPAGATION WE COULD LEARN LESS FEATURES AND THERE'S A LOT OF HYPE ABOUT HOW THIS WAS GOING TO SOLVE EVERYTHING THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE
YOU1000000124_S0000029	THAT IS I BELIEVED IN THE EIGHTY S THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY WAS GOING TO HAPPEN THEN AND IT DIDN'T
YOU1000000124_S0000031	THE NINETEEN NINETY S
YOU1000000124_S0000033	PEOPLE SHOWED THERE WERE OTHER MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS THAT WERE BETTER THAN BACKPROPAGATION ON MODEST SIZED PROBLEMS THINGS CALLED SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES
YOU1000000124_S0000034	THEY HAD FANCIER MATH AND THEY WORKED A LITTLE BIT BETTER ON WHAT WE NOW THINK OF AS VERY SMALL PROBLEMS THINGS WITH A FEW THOUSAND TRAINING EXAMPLES
YOU1000000124_S0000036	WIPE DOWN AGAIN
YOU1000000124_S0000038	THEN IN ABOUT TWO THOUSAND AND SIX WE CAME UP WITH SOME TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS TO NEURAL NETWORKS THAT MADE THEM A BIT EASIER TO LEARN
YOU1000000124_S0000039	AND THAT WASN'T THE MAIN POINT AT THAT TIME WE GOT MORE COMPUTATION AND MORE DATA AND SUDDENLY NEURAL NETWORKS WITH LOTS OF LAYERS OF FEATURES WORKED AMAZINGLY WELL
YOU1000000124_S0000040	AND NOW GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK AND MICROSOFT AND APPLE AND AMAZON AND ALL THE OTHER HIGH TECH COMPANIES YOU CAN THINK OF INCLUDING EVERYONE ALL BETTING THE FARM ON OUR NETWORKS
YOU1000000124_S0000041	THEY BELIEVE THAT'S CERTAINLY TO BE THE FUTURE AND THERE'S A HUGE DEMAND FOR STUDENTS WHO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT NEURAL NETWORKS
YOU1000000124_S0000043	SO THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE A COMPUTER DO WHAT YOU WANTED WAS TO WRITE A PROGRAM
YOU1000000124_S0000044	WHERE YOU FIGURE OUT HOW YOU WOULD DO IT YOURSELF AND THEN YOU EXPLAIN TO THE COMPUTER IN EXQUISITE DETAIL HOW TO DO WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE DONE YOURSELF BUT A WHOLE LOT FASTER
YOU1000000124_S0000046	SO IF I WANT TO SORT A LIST FOR EXAMPLE I WOULD FIGURE OUT WELL I'M NOT A COMPUTER SCIENTIST QUICKLY REALIZE
YOU1000000124_S0000047	WOULD FIGURE OUT WELL I COULD GO DOWN THE LIST AND FIND THE BIGGEST THING AND THEN PUT THAT AT THE TOP AND THEN I COULD GO DOWN THE LIST AGAIN AND FIND THE NEXT BIGGEST THING AND PUT THAT UNDERNEATH DOING
YOU1000000124_S0000048	IT'S NOT A GOOD ALGORITHM BUT I MIGHT DECIDE TO DO IT LIKE THAT AND THEN I COULD TELL THE COMPUTER TO DO THAT AND THEN THE COMPUTER WOULD SORT IS FASTER THAN I
YOU1000000124_S0000050	THE NEW WAY TO DO IT IS TO YOU FIRST TELL THE COMPUTER TO PRETEND TO BE A NEURAL NET
YOU1000000124_S0000052	THEN YOU JUST SHOW EXAMPLES SO YOU SHOW AN EXAMPLE OF AN UNSORTED LIST AND SORTED LIST AND YOU SHOW LOTS OF EXAMPLES AND YOU SAY I WANT YOU TO TAKE THESE THINGS AND PRODUCE THOSE THINGS
YOU1000000124_S0000053	AND AFTER A WHILE IT GETS THE IDEA THAT IS YOU DON'T HAVE TO WRITE THE PROGRAM
YOU1000000124_S0000055	SORTING LISTS IS SOMETHING THAT'S DIFFICULT TO DO THIS WAY RECOGNIZING OBJECTS AND IMAGES IS SOMETHING THAT'S MUCH EASIER TO DO THIS
YOU1000000124_S0000057	HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING WE'D LIKE COMPUTERS TO DO AND PEOPLE IN CLASSICAL AI TRIED TO DO THIS FOR FIFTY YEARS AND THEY DIDN'T MAKE MUCH PROGRESS
YOU1000000124_S0000058	SO THE IDEA IS YOU'LL GIVE THEM THE VALUES OF WHOLE BUNCH OF PIXELS AND YOU HAVE TO CONVERT THOSE TO A CAPTION THAT DESCRIBES WHAT'S IN THE IMAGE
YOU1000000124_S0000059	SO YOU GET ALL THESE NUMBERS COMING IN AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE A STRING OF WORDS COMING OUT
YOU1000000124_S0000061	AND YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW YOU MIGHT GO ABOUT WRITING A PROGRAM TO DO THAT BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT
YOU1000000124_S0000062	YOU FIRST OF ALL WOULD MAYBE WRITE A PROGRAM TO FIND LITTLE PIECES OF EDGE IN THE IMAGE OR MAYBE COLOR CONTRAST
YOU1000000124_S0000063	AND JUST DOING VISION WOULD BE MORE THAN YOU CAN DO
YOU1000000124_S0000065	THEN RELATING THE VISION TO THE LANGUAGE WOULD BE COMPLICATED NOW WHAT WE CAN DO IS WE CAN SOLVE THAT PROBLEM JUST BY USING MACHINE LEARNING
YOU1000000124_S0000067	WITH HARDLY ANY HAND PROGRAM
YOU1000000124_S0000069	AND BY THE END OF THE LECTURE YOU UNDERSTAND HOW YOU DO THAT
YOU1000000124_S0000071	OKAY IS THAT LOUD OKAY I THINK LIKE
YOU1000000124_S0000073	SO I'M GOING TO EXPLAIN MANY OF YOU KNOW THIS ALREADY BUT EXPLAIN WHAT IT IS IT'S A LITTLE COMPUTATIONAL DEVICE
YOU1000000124_S0000074	THAT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE A REAL NEURON BUT NOT VERY IT TAKES SOME INPUTS COMING TYPICALLY FROM OTHER NEURONS IT HAS WEIGHT ON THE CONNECTIONS
YOU1000000124_S0000075	IT TAKES THE INPUTS TIMES THE WEIGHT AND THIS IS TOTAL INPUT AND THEN I PUT IT THROUGH ONE FUNCTION
YOU1000000124_S0000076	THAT LONDON IS WHAT WE MOSTLY USE NOW AND THAT'S ITS OUTPUT
YOU1000000124_S0000077	SO BASICALLY THAT FUNCTION SIMPLY SAYS IF YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF INPUT GIVE A LOT OF OUTPUT AND IF YOUR INPUTS BELOW A THRESHOLD DON'T GIVE ANY OUTPUT
YOU1000000124_S0000078	SO IT'S CALLED RECTIFIED
YOU1000000124_S0000080	THE QUESTION IS IF YOU PUT TOGETHER A BUNCH OF THOSE GUYS AND YOU FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE THOSE WEIGHTS ON THE CONNECTIONS ADAPT WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH IT
YOU1000000124_S0000082	SO WE TYPICALLY HOOK THEM TOGETHER BY MAKING MULTIPLE LAYERS THIS AGAIN IS SORT OF NEURAL INSPIRED AND IF YOU LOOK AT MULTIPLE NEURONAL LIKE THAT
YOU1000000124_S0000084	THE LAYERS IN THE MIDDLE IT'S HARD TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE WEIGHT SHOULD BE WHEN YOU ADAPT THOSE WEIGHTS IN EFFECT YOU'RE DECIDING WHAT FEATURES
YOU1000000124_S0000085	THE NUNS IN THE MIDDLE YOU DETECT SO THE PROBLEM OF ADAPTING THESE WAS THE PROBLEM OF DECIDING WHAT INTERMEDIATE FEATURES DO YOU WANT THE SAME PROBLEM
YOU1000000124_S0000087	SHOW YOU A WAY OF LEARNING THOSE FEATURES THAT'S REALLY STUPID
YOU1000000124_S0000088	WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU INPUTS AND WE'RE GOING TO TELL YOU ALL THE RIGHT ANSWERS
YOU1000000124_S0000089	AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO DO IT ONE AT A TIME
YOU1000000124_S0000091	SUPPOSE YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT WILL TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PICTURES OF CATS AND PICTURES OF DOGS WE GIVE TWO OUTS ON A ONE
YOU1000000124_S0000092	AND IF YOU SHOW A CAT AND THE ANGLE OF THE DOG IS HIGHER THAN THE ANGLE OF A CAT THAT'S BAD SO WE CAN SHOW A BUNCH OF PICTURES AND MEASURE HOW WELL IT'S DOING
YOU1000000124_S0000094	THEN WE CAN PICK ONE OF THE WEIGHTS IN THE NETWORK AND WE CAN CHANGE THE VALUE OF THAT WEIGHT
YOU1000000124_S0000096	WE CAN SEE IF THE NETWORK IS DOING BETTER OR WORSE THAN IT WAS BEFORE TO SEE THAT YOU NEED TO SHOW A BUNCH OF EXAMPLES
YOU1000000124_S0000097	IF THE CHANGE WORK WE KEEP IT AND THEN WE DO IT AGAIN ANOTHER
YOU1000000124_S0000099	I THINK YOU CAN SEE THAT THAT ALGORITHM IS GOING TO HAVE TO SHOW A BUNCH OF EXAMPLES FOR EACH WEIGHT IF YOU'VE GOT A MILLION WEIGHTS IT'S GOING TO BE EXTREMELY SLOW
YOU1000000124_S0000101	THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO DO WE WANT TO CHANGE WEIGHTS IN THE DIRECTION THAT MAKES THEM HEALTH THAT'S ALL WE'RE TRYING TO DO WE'RE JUST TRYING TO DO THAT EFFICIENTLY
YOU1000000124_S0000102	AND BY PROPAGATION WHICH MANY OF YOU KNOW BUT I'M NOT GOING TO EXPLAIN THAT
YOU1000000124_S0000103	IT'S JUST AN EFFICIENT WAY OF COMPUTING HOW TO CHANGE THE WEIGHTS IN THE DIRECTION THAT WILL HELP REDUCE THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN WHAT THE NETWORK OUTPUTS AND WHAT YOU'D LIKE IT TO OUTPUT
YOU1000000124_S0000105	AND THE BIG DIFFERENCE IS THAT IF YOU PERTURB THE WEIGHTS YOU MEASURE THE EFFECTS OF A CHANGE OF WEIGHT ON THE OUTPUT
YOU1000000124_S0000106	AND WITH A PROPAGATION YOU COMPUTE THE EFFECTS SO IF YOU KNOW ALL THE WAY ON THE NETWORK YOU DON'T HAVE TO MEASURE YOU CAN COMPUTE
YOU1000000124_S0000107	AND WHEN YOU COMPUTE YOU CAN COMPUTE FOR ALL THE WEIGHTS AT THE SAME TIME WHAT DIRECTION YOU SHOULD CHANGE THEM TO HELP
YOU1000000124_S0000108	YOU CAN'T DO THAT WHEN YOU'RE MEASURING YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THE TIME
YOU1000000124_S0000110	SO MEASURING SO COMPUTING IS MUCH MORE RATIONAL MEASUREMENT EVOLUTION CAN'T DO THE SAME MEASURING CAN'T DO THE SAME COMPUTING ALGORITHM BECAUSE EVOLUTION CHANGE A GENE
YOU1000000124_S0000111	AND THEN THERE'S A WHOLE DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESS IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND YOU DON'T KNOW ALL THAT SO YOU CAN'T PROPAGATE THROUGH
YOU1000000124_S0000113	WHAT EVOLUTION DID WAS I CAME UP WITH THE BRAIN SO THAT IT COULD USE BACK ON IT THAT'S IT
YOU1000000124_S0000114	SO BACKPROPAGATION YOU GO FORWARD THROUGH THESE LAYERS YOU COMPARE WITH THE CORRECT ANSWER YOU BACK PROPAGATE SIGNALS THAT ALLOWS YOU TO COMPUTE EACH WAIT WHAT DIRECTION TO CHANGE IT IN TO MAKE IT WORK BETTER
YOU1000000124_S0000116	AND WE THOUGHT IN THE EIGHTY S THAT WAS PROBLEM SOLVING WE CAN NOW LEARN LOTS OF THOSE AND IT DIDN'T WORK VERY WELL
YOU1000000124_S0000118	WE DIDN'T KNOW WHY IT DIDN'T WORK MOST PEOPLE THOUGHT IT DIDN'T WORK BECAUSE THIS WAS A STUPID IDEA THAT IS THE IDEA THAT YOU WOULD TAKE A NETWORK WITH RANDOM WEIGHTS
YOU1000000124_S0000119	AND YOU JUST SHOW ALL DATA AS A RESULT OF SEEING THIS DATA BE ABLE TO DESIGN ALL HIS OWN FEATURE DETECTORS
YOU1000000124_S0000120	AND DO VERY GOOD PERFORMANCE OF THINGS LIKE MACHINE TRANSLATION RECOGNIZING OBJECTS AND IMAGES OR RECOGNISING SPEECH
YOU1000000124_S0000122	ALMOST EVERYBODY THOUGHT THAT IDEA WAS COMPLETELY CRAZY A FEW OF US DIDN'T A FEW OF US JUST THOUGHT WE DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S NOT WORKING
YOU1000000124_S0000123	IT'S OBVIOUSLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND WE DISCOVERED LATER THE REASON IT WASN'T WORKING WAS BECAUSE COMPUTERS WERE TOO SLOW AND DATASETS WEREN'T
YOU1000000124_S0000124	IF YOU SAID THAT IN THE EIGHTY S PEOPLE WOULD SAY OH YEAH SURE IF YOU HAD A BIGGER COMPUTER AND MORE DATA IT WOULD WORK BUT LOOK IT DOESN'T WORK IT TURNED OUT THAT WAS RIGHT
YOU1000000124_S0000125	AND WHEN WE GOT BIGGER COMPUTER AND MORE DATA IT WORKED NOW THERE ARE SOME TECHNICAL THINGS TOO BUT IT WAS MAINLY THE INCREASING COMPUTER SPEED AND DATA SIZE THAT MATTERED
YOU1000000124_S0000128	SO I'M GONNA SHOW YOU A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES BEFORE I GET BACK TO THE ISSUE OF OTHERS
YOU1000000124_S0000130	EXAMPLE THAT PROBABLY HAS THE MOST IMPACT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE THERE WAS A BIG PUBLIC COMPETITION WHERE YOU HAVE A THOUSAND DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBJECTS AND A MILLION TRAINING IMAGES
YOU1000000124_S0000131	AND YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO RECOGNIZE DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBJECTS AND THERE'S A SECRET TEST SET SO YOU CAN'T TUNE ON THE TEST SET
YOU1000000124_S0000132	AND IS COUNTED AS RIGHT IF YOU GET THE CORRECT CLASS IN YOUR TOP FIVE BEDS BECAUSE IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT THE RIGHT BET IS FOR SOMEONE
YOU1000000124_S0000133	EXAMPLE YOU HAVE AN IMAGE WHICH HAS A DONATION OR A BOWL OF CHERRIES AND DAMNATION SAID CHERRIES ONE OF THOSE IS RIGHT AND IF YOU SAY BOTH YOU'RE GOING TO GET IT RIGHT
YOU1000000124_S0000136	SO ONE OF THE BEST EXISTING COMPUTER VISION METHODS WERE USED AND THE RESULTS LOOK LIKE THIS
YOU1000000124_S0000138	RESULTS AT THE TOP ARE WHERE WE ARE NOW RESULTS BELOW
YOU1000000124_S0000140	TWO OF MY GRADUATE STUDENTS UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO MANAGED TO GET SIXTEEN PERCENT
YOU1000000124_S0000141	AND THEN THE BEST COMPUTER VISION GROUPS WERE GETTING MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE PERCENT
YOU1000000124_S0000142	SO WE ALMOST HAVE THE ERROR RATE AND THAT HAD A HUGE IMPACT ON COMPUTER VISION ALMOST OVERNIGHT THAT IS WITHIN A YEAR
YOU1000000124_S0000143	ALL THE LEADING PEOPLE CHANGE FROM DOING AND TUNE THINGS DOING WHAT THEY WERE DOING BEFORE TO DOING NEURONES
YOU1000000124_S0000144	AND SO IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN IF YOU SEND A PAPER USING YOUR ONTO A COMPUTER VISION CONFERENCE IT WOULD BE REJECTED BECAUSE IT WAS USING YOUR ONE
YOU1000000124_S0000145	AND BY TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN IF YOU SEND A PAPER TO COMPUTERVISION CONFERENCE IT WOULD BE REJECTED IF I WASN'T USING REALLY CHANGE
YOU1000000124_S0000147	IT WAS OBVIOUS IF TWO GRAD STUDENTS CAN BE THE BEST COMPUTER VISION RESEARCHERS WHO'VE BEEN DOING THIS STUFF FOR THIRTY YEARS THEN YOU'RE GOING TO DEVELOP A LOT FURTHER
YOU1000000124_S0000148	AND THINGS DID BY TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN THE ERROR RATE IT WAS DOWN TO FIVE PERCENT WHICH IS ABOUT THE HUMAN RACE AND NOW DOWN TO THREE PERCENT IT'S INCREDIBLY DIFFERENT
YOU1000000124_S0000150	JUST SHOW YOU SOME EXAMPLES OF THAT KIND OF RECOGNITION
YOU1000000124_S0000152	THERE'S AN IMAGE AND THE RIGHT ANSWER IS CHET AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE WHAT THE NEURON SAYS IT'S VERY CONFIDENT THAT CHET IS THE RIGHT ANSWER
YOU1000000124_S0000153	AND IT HAS A FEW OTHER THINGS IT THINKS AREN'T TOTALLY OUT OF THE QUESTION LIKE LEOPARD AND SNEDAKER AND EGYPTIAN CAT SO THE POINT IS ALL ITS BACKUP ANSWERS ARE VERY SENSIBLE ANSWERS
YOU1000000124_S0000154	AND NOTICE THAT'S NOT A SORT OF TYPICAL IMAGE OF A CHEATER HALF THE HEADS MISSING AND IT'S A CHEATER CLOSE UP RIGHT
YOU1000000124_S0000155	IT'S NOT A SORT OF CLASSIC IT'S NOT THE DIAGRAM MAKE A CHEATER JUST SHOW SOMEBODY WHAT A THEATER IS
YOU1000000124_S0000157	A BULLET TRAIN AND YOU'LL NOTICE THE BULLET TRAIN PROBABLY OCCUPIES LESS THAN TEN PERCENT OF THE PIXELS THE BUILDING IN THE BACKGROUND IS MUCH BIGGER
YOU1000000124_S0000158	THERE'S A PLATFORM THERE'S A PERSON ON THE PLATFORM BUT IT SORT OF KNOWS WHAT THE RIGHT ANSWER IS LIKELY TO BE BECAUSE IT'S UNDERSTOOD ABOUT THE FOCUS OF IMAGES
YOU1000000124_S0000159	YOU PUT THE THING YOU WANT TO ATTEND TO IN THE MIDDLE AND ALTERNATIVE ANSWERS ARE QUITE REASONABLE
YOU1000000124_S0000161	WE WERE WRONG
YOU1000000124_S0000163	SO THE CORRECT ANSWER IS A
YOU1000000124_S0000165	I THINK THE BEST ANSWER IS SCISSORS AND YOU CAN SORT OF SEE WHY MIGHT SCISSORS YOU CAN SEE BETTER WHY MIGHT THINK
YOU1000000124_S0000166	IT DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THING THAT I THINK MUST BE A CHAIN IS IN THE HANDLE OF A FRYING PAN BASICALLY NEEDS GLASSES
YOU1000000124_S0000167	YOU SEE WHY I SAY STETHOSCOPE BUT THE IMPORTANT THING HERE IS THAT ALL THE WRONG ANSWERS ARE VISUALLY PLAUSIBLE WRONG ANSWERS
YOU1000000124_S0000168	GIVE YOU AN IDEA THAT I UNDERSTAND A LOT ABOUT WHAT THINGS LOOK LIKE
YOU1000000124_S0000170	OKAY SO THAT HAS A HUGE EFFECT ON COMPUTER VISION AND THEN A FEW YEARS LATER
YOU1000000124_S0000171	SOME VERY GREAT PEOPLE INCLUDING SOCA WHO WAS ONE OF THE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE IMAGE NET SYSTEM
YOU1000000124_S0000173	DECIDED THE NEURAL NETS ON MACHINE TRANSLATION AND MACHINE TRANSLATION OUGHT TO BE THE PERFECT PROBLEM FOR SYMBOLIC AI
YOU1000000124_S0000174	SO PEOPLE IN SYMBOLIC AI I MEAN WE ALL AGREE THAT SYMBOLS COME IN AND SYMBOLS COME OUT OKAY
YOU1000000124_S0000175	THE QUESTION IS WHAT'S IN BETWEEN IS JUST MORE SYMBOLS
YOU1000000124_S0000176	SO THE CLASSIC AI VIEW IS SYMBOLS COME IN WHAT'S INSIDE IS SORT OF LIKE SYMBOLS SORT OF CLEANED UP SYMBOLS
YOU1000000124_S0000177	IT'S SYMBOLIC EXPRESSION AND YOU DO MANIPULATIONS ON SYMBOLIC EXPRESSIONS AND THEN ANOTHER SYMBOL STRING COMES OUT SO IT'S CALLED SYMBOLS
YOU1000000124_S0000179	THE BIOLOGICAL VIEW WOULD BE SYMBOLS COME IN THERE THE WAY WE CODE THINGS TO GO OVER A COMMUNICATION CHANNEL
YOU1000000124_S0000180	THEY RESIST NOISE NICELY ONCE THE SYMBOLS HAVE COME IN THEY GET CONVERTED INTO THINGS THAT ARE NOTHING LIKE THOSE SYMBOLS
YOU1000000124_S0000182	SO THE POINT ABOUT A SYMBOL IS IT ONLY HAS BASICALLY ONE PROPERTY A SYMBOL EITHER IS OR IS NOT IDENTICAL TO ANOTHER SYMBOL
YOU1000000124_S0000184	TAKE TWO DIFFERENT SYMBOLS THE ONLY PROPERTY THAT IS ARE THEY THE SAME SYMBOL
YOU1000000124_S0000186	ALL THE OTHER PROPERTIES ARE JUST
YOU1000000124_S0000188	ARBITRARY PROPERTIES OF THE SYMBOLS THAT ARE NOT RELEVANT TO THE PROCESS
YOU1000000124_S0000190	IN NEURAL NETS WHAT HAPPENS IS A SYMBOL COMES IN AND IT GETS CONVERTED INTO A GREAT BIG VECTOR THAT HAS ALL SORTS OF FEATURES
YOU1000000124_S0000191	THAT CAPTURE LOTS OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE MEANING OF THAT WORD
YOU1000000124_S0000193	AND WORDS THAT MEAN SIMILAR THINGS BUT DON'T LOOK SIMILAR LIKE FRIDAY AND WEDNESDAY
YOU1000000124_S0000195	MEAN PRETTY SIMILAR THINGS THE DISTINCT SYMBOLS
YOU1000000124_S0000197	THERE'S NOTHING WELL THERE'S THE MORPHINE STRUCTURE OF DAY THAT'S AN EXAMPLE BUT BUT BASICALLY THE
YOU1000000124_S0000199	THE DISTINCT SYMBOLS AND THAT'S ALL A SYMBOL PROCESSING SYSTEM KNOWS IN A NEURAL NET IT LEARNS THAT WEDNESDAY AND FRIDAY ARE VERY VERY SIMILAR THINGS WE'LL SEE THAT
YOU1000000124_S0000201	SO THE SYMBOLIC APPROACH TO MACHINE TRANSLATION IS TO SAY OKAY A SIMPLE STRING COMES IN IN ENGLISH
YOU1000000124_S0000202	SOME MANIPULATION USING RULES CLEARLY GOING TO USE RULES OF GRAMMAR BUT WE'RE ALSO GONNA USE SEMANTIC RULES THAT SOMEHOW DO COMPOSITIONAL SEMANTICS
YOU1000000124_S0000203	THAT IS GIVEN WHAT THE INDIVIDUAL PIECES MEAN THEY FIGURE OUT WHAT A GROUP OF PIECES MUST MEAN AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO PRODUCE SYMBOLS COMING IN
YOU1000000124_S0000205	WE'RE GOING TO USE ALL THE KNOWLEDGE THAT LINGUISTS HAVE ABOUT HOW LANGUAGE WORKS
YOU1000000124_S0000207	NEURAL NETWORK APPROACH NOW EVEN I THOUGHT THIS WAS A BIT CRAZY BIT AMBITIOUS
YOU1000000124_S0000208	IS TO SAY LET'S JUST TAKE A WHOLE BUNCH OF TRANSLATIONS PAIRS OF AN ENGLISH SENTENCE AND FRENCH SENTENCE
YOU1000000124_S0000210	AND WE'LL STICK IN THE CENTER ONE WORD AT A TIME AND THEN WE'LL GO INTO A RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK WHICH I'LL EXPLAIN IN A MINUTE WHERE THINGS CYCLE AROUND INSIDE
YOU1000000124_S0000212	AFTER WE FINISHED STICKING IN THE ENGLISH SENTENCE THAT RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK WILL HAVE SOME PARTICULAR STATE OF ACTIVITY AND WE'LL CALL THAT A THOUGHT FACTOR
YOU1000000124_S0000214	THAT'S WHAT A THOUGHT IS IT'S THE STATE OF ACTIVITY OF THE URINE AFTER IT'S READ THE ENGLISH SENTENCE
YOU1000000124_S0000216	AND YOU'LL NOTICE IF YOU THINK ABOUT HOW THE WORLD THOUGHT WORKS IN ENGLISH I CAN SAY
YOU1000000125_S0000000	WELL I'LL TELL YOU A COUPLE OF STRANGE THINGS THAT THAT THINGS THAT I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THE FIRST IS WHEN WE'VE DONE THE ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF THE FUTURE AUTHORING PROGRAM
YOU1000000125_S0000001	IT HAS HAD A DIFFERENTIAL DIFFERENTIAL IMPACT ON MEN
YOU1000000125_S0000002	AND IT'S HAD A PARTICULARLY DIFFERENTIAL IMPACT ON WHAT I WOULD CALL EXCLUDED MEN
YOU1000000125_S0000003	AND SO THAT WOULD BE NON WESTERN ETHNIC MINORITY MEN OR OR WHAT
YOU1000000125_S0000004	MAJORITY MEN WHO AREN'T DOING VERY WELL SO FOR EXAMPLE AT MOHAWK COLLEGE
YOU1000000125_S0000005	THE FUTURE AUTHORING PROGRAM HAD A PARTICULARLY ROBUST EFFECT ON MOHAWK COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO WERE MEN WHO HADN'T DONE VERY WELL IN HIGH SCHOOL AND WHO HADN'T PICKED A MAJOR
YOU1000000125_S0000006	HAD A DESTINATION A CAREER DESTINATION AT ITS END
YOU1000000125_S0000007	SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THOSE PEOPLE ARE THEY HAVE AN AMBIGUOUS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE IDEA OF EDUCATION
YOU1000000125_S0000008	AND THEY'RE NOT ORIENTED SPECIFICALLY TOWARDS A GOAL THEY'RE NOT VERY MOTIVATED
YOU1000000125_S0000010	NOW WHY DID IT HAVE A DIFFERENTIAL EFFECT ON MAN THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION
YOU1000000125_S0000012	WELL FIRST OF ALL THE WOMEN ARE DOING BETTER
YOU1000000125_S0000013	SO IT MIGHT JUST BE A MATTER OF THE FACT THAT IT DOES BETTER FOR PEOPLE WHO AREN'T DOING AS WELL AND AT THE MOMENT MOST OF THEM ARE MEN
YOU1000000125_S0000014	I DON'T BELIEVE I THINK THAT MIGHT BE PART OF IT BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S ALL OF IT
YOU1000000125_S0000015	I THINK THAT PART OF THE REASON THAT WOMEN ARE DOING BETTER IS BECAUSE THEY'RE AGREEABLE AND SO IF A SYSTEM SETS OUT A STRUCTURE AND SAYS HERE'S A PATHWAY TO ATTAINMENT
YOU1000000125_S0000016	THE WOMEN WON'T REBEL AGAINST THAT THEY'LL GO ALONG WITH IT AND THAT'S WORKING VERY WELL FOR THEM AT THE MOMENT
YOU1000000125_S0000017	THE MEN ESPECIALLY THE MEN ON THE DISAGREEABLE END OF THE DISTRIBUTION AND THERE'S WAY MORE MEN ON THE DISTRI DISAGREEABLE END OF THE DISTRIBUTION THAN THERE ARE WOMEN
YOU1000000125_S0000018	RIGHT THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FROM IF YOU LOOK AT OVERLAPPING NORMAL DISTRIBUTION SO THERE'S THE MALE FEMALE DISTRIBUTION FOR AGREEABLENESS
YOU1000000125_S0000019	MALE DISTRIBUTION FOR AGREEABLENESS TREMENDOUS OVER
YOU1000000125_S0000021	WOMEN ARE HIGHER ALL THE REALLY AGREEABLE PEOPLE ARE WOMEN ALL THE REALLY DISAGREEABLE PEOPLE ARE MEN AND MAYBE THE REAL DIFFERENCES OCCUR AT THE EXTREMES RIGHT SO
YOU1000000125_S0000022	SO AND IT'S IT'S A VERY INTERESTING SIDE EFFECT OF OVERLAPPING DISTRIBUTION SO THE PEOPLE CAN BE MOSTLY THE SAME BUT THAT CAN STILL PRODUCE RADICAL DIFFERENCES
YOU1000000125_S0000024	DISAGREEABLE MEN WON'T DO ANYTHING THEY DON'T WANT TO DO
YOU1000000125_S0000026	THEY JUST SAY UP YOURS I'LL GO HOME AND PLAY VIDEO GAMES WITH YOU I'M NOT LISTENING TO YOUR STUPID CLASSES AND WHY SHOULD I WORK FOR YOU I'LL JUST GO HAVE FUN
YOU1000000125_S0000027	I'LL DO MY OWN THING I DON'T THINK THEY'RE MOTIVATED AND SO THEN IF YOU TAKE THE MEN WHO ARE LIKE THAT AND YOU SAY OKAY WHAT DO YOU WANT
YOU1000000125_S0000029	YOU CAN HAVE WHAT YOU WANT BUT YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS SO THEN THEY WRITE DOWN WHAT THEY WANT THEY THINK OH HEY WELL THAT MIGHT BE WORTH HAVING SO MAYBE I'LL PUT SOME EFFORT INTO IT
YOU1000000125_S0000030	THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TO ME NOW YOU KNOW THAT'S WEAK EVIDENCE AND THIS IS A WEAK ARGUMENT BUT I'M TRYING TO STRETCH OUT MY UNDERSTANDING TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS BUT I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S REALLY WEIRD
YOU1000000125_S0000031	I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS EITHER SO
YOU1000000125_S0000033	MORE THAN NINETY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE WHO WATCH MY VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE ARE MEN NOW THAT'S WEIRD BECAUSE ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT OF PSYCHOLOGY STUDENTS ARE WOMEN
YOU1000000125_S0000034	SO THAT IS NOT WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT RIGHT YOU'D EXPECT THAT THE MAJORITY OF THEM WOULD BE WOMEN AND YOU MIGHT SAY WELL IT'S BECAUSE OF THE POLITICAL STANCE I'VE TAKEN
YOU1000000125_S0000035	AND I THOUGHT WELL THAT'S POSSIBLE SO I WENT AND LOOKED AT THE DEMOGRAPHIC DATA BECAUSE I HAVE THAT WELL BEFORE I DID ANY OF THE POLITICAL VIDEOS EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF MY VIEWERS WERE MEN
YOU1000000125_S0000036	SO IT'S ACTUALLY INCREASED A BIT IT'S INCREASED BY SIX PERCENT AND THAT'S NOT TRIVIAL BUT IT WAS STILL OVERWHELMINGLY MEANT
YOU1000000125_S0000037	SO THAT WAS INTERESTING I THOUGHT WHAT THE HELL WHY IS THAT EXACTLY AND THEN NOW I'VE BEEN WATCHING CROWDS WHEN I'VE BEEN TALKING TO THEM AND THE CROWDS THAT HAVE COME TO SEE ME IN PERSON
YOU1000000125_S0000038	THIS HAPPENED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO FREE SPEECH DEBATE AND I ACTUALLY NOTICED IT AND COMMENTED ON IT BEFORE THE DEBATE TOOK PLACE BECAUSE I WAS TALKING ABOUT INTRINSIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN
YOU1000000125_S0000039	AND I LOOKED AROUND THE ROOM AND I THOUGHT HEY EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM ARE MEN SO I HAD ALL THE MEN AND WOMEN STAND UP AND THEN ALL THE MEN STAND UP I SAID LOOK LIKE
YOU1000000125_S0000040	HERE'S A NATURAL EXPERIMENT FOR SOME REASON EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE WHO SHOWED UP TO THIS ARE MEN NOW EVERYBODY THOUGHT I WAS KIND OF CRACKED TO TO DO THAT
YOU1000000125_S0000041	AND IT WAS A RISK YOU KNOW AND AND BUT I THOUGHT NO THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON HERE AND THEN WHAT'S INTERESTING NOW IS THAT EVERY PUBLIC APPEARANCE THAT I'VE MADE
YOU1000000125_S0000042	THAT'S RELATED TO THE SORT OF TOPICS THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING IS OVERWHELMINGLY MEN IT'S LIKE IT'S LIKE EIGHTY FIVE TO NINETY PERCENT
YOU1000000125_S0000043	AND SO I THOUGHT WOW THAT'S WEIRD LIKE WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON HERE EXACTLY AND THEN THE OTHER THING I'VE NOTICED IS THAT
YOU1000000125_S0000044	I'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT TO THE CROWDS THAT I'VE BEEN TALKING TO NOT ABOUT RIGHTS BUT ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY RIGHT
YOU1000000125_S0000045	BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HAVE THE BLOODY CONVERSE WHAT ARE YOU DOING YOU CAN'T HAVE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT RIGHTS WITHOUT THE CONVERSATION ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE
YOU1000000125_S0000046	YOUR RIGHTS ARE MY RESPONSIBILITY THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE TECHNICALLY SO YOU JUST CAN'T HAVE ONLY HALF OF THAT DISCUSSION
YOU1000000125_S0000047	AND WE'RE ONLY HAVING HALF THAT DISCUSSION AND THE QUESTION IS WELL WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU LEAVING OUT IF YOU ONLY HAVE THAT HALF OF THE DISCUSSION
YOU1000000125_S0000048	AND THE ANSWER IS WELL YOU'RE LEAVING OUT RESPONSIBILITY AND THEN THE QUESTION IS WELL WHAT ARE YOU LEAVING OUT IF YOU'RE LEAVING OUT RESPONSIBILITY AND THE ANSWER MIGHT BE WELL MAYBE YOU'RE LEAVING OUT THE MEANING OF LIFE
YOU1000000125_S0000050	THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TO ME IT'S LIKE HERE YOU ARE SUFFERING AWAY WHAT MAKES IT WORTHWHILE RIGHTS
YOU1000000125_S0000051	YOU KNOW YOU'RE COMPLETELY YOU'RE COMPLETELY YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE YOU IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE HOW BAD AN IDEA THAT IS
YOU1000000125_S0000053	RESPONSIBILITY
YOU1000000125_S0000055	THAT'S WHAT GIVES LIFE MEANING IT'S LIKE LIFT A LOAD THEN YOU CAN TOLERATE YOURSELF RIGHT BECAUSE LOOK AT YOU'RE USELESS EASILY HURT
YOU1000000125_S0000056	EASILY KILLED WHY SHOULD YOU HAVE ANY SELF RESPECT THAT'S THE STORY OF THE FALL PICK SOMETHING UP AND CARRY IT MAKE IT HEAVY ENOUGH SO THAT YOU CAN THINK
YOU1000000125_S0000057	YEAH WELL USELESS AS I AM AT LEAST I CAN MOVE THAT FROM THERE TO THERE WELL WHAT'S REALLY COOL ABOUT THAT IS THAT WHEN I TALK TO THESE CROWDS ABOUT THIS
YOU1000000125_S0000058	THE MEN'S EYES LIGHT UP AND THAT'S VERY LIKE I'VE SEEN THAT PHENOMENON BECAUSE I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS MYTHOLOGICAL MATERIAL FOR A LONG TIME AND I CAN SEE WHEN I'M WATCHING CROWDS PEOPLE YOU KNOW THEIR EYEBROWS
YOU1000000125_S0000059	THEIR EYES LIGHT UP BECAUSE I PUT SOMETHING TOGETHER FOR THEM THAT'S WHAT MYTHOLOGICAL STORIES DO SO I'M NOT TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT THAT'S WHAT THE STORIES DO
YOU1000000125_S0000060	SAY THE STORY AND PEOPLE GO CLICK CLICK CLICK YOU KNOW AND THEIR EYES LIGHT UP BUT THIS RESPONSIBILITY THING THAT'S A WHOLE NEW ORDER OF THIS IS THAT YOUNG MEN ARE SO HUNGRY FOR
YOU1000000125_S0000061	IT IS UNBELIEVABLE AND ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE BEEN TALKING TO SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN RUNNING FOR THE CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP IN CANADA AND I'VE BEEN TALKING TO THEM ABOUT
YOU1000000125_S0000062	WELL THE DIFFICULTIES THEY HAVE COMMUNICATING WITH YOUNG PEOPLE BECAUSE CONSERVATIVES WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY GOING TO SELL TO YOUNG PEOPLE RIGHT BECAUSE BEING CONSERVATIVE IS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE OLDER THEY CAN SELL RESPONSIBILITY
YOU1000000125_S0000064	NO ONE'S SELLING IT AND THE THING IS FOR MEN THERE'S NOTHING BUT RESPONSIBILITY YOU KNOW I WAS WATCHING THE SIMPSONS THE OTHER DAY I WATCHED THE FIRST SIMPSONS EPISODE
YOU1000000125_S0000065	AND I DECONSTRUCTED
YOU1000000125_S0000067	SO IT'S REALLY INTERESTING SO WHAT HAPPENS IN THE FIRST SIMPSON EPISODE IS THAT IT'S CHRISTMAS AND HOMER AND MARGE ARE GOING TO BUY SOME CHRISTMAS PRESENTS BUT HOMER DOESN'T GET HIS CHRISTMAS BONUS
YOU1000000125_S0000068	AND SO HE'S ABSOLUTELY CRUSHED BY THAT AND THAT ACTUALLY IS A RECURRING THEME IN THE SIMPSONS WHERE HOMER LOSES HIS JOB OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR CAN'T MAKE ENOUGH MONEY
YOU1000000125_S0000069	HE'S COMPLETELY CRUSHED EVEN THOUGH HE'S KIND OF USELESS BUMBLING LAUGHING FOOL OF A GUY YOU KNOW
YOU1000000125_S0000070	THE THING THAT GIVES THAT SHOW HIS SOUL IS THAT HE'S STILL ORIENTED TOWARDS HIS FAMILY THAT'S WHAT MAKES HIM HONORABLE IS THAT FOOLISH AS HE IS
YOU1000000125_S0000071	HE'S DECIDED TO ADOPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS FAMILY AND TO TRY TO BEAR THAT AND SO HE'S NOT HE'S A WHOLLY FOOL HE'S NOT A COMPLETE FOOL
YOU1000000125_S0000072	AND IT'S SO INTERESTING WATCHING THE STORY BECAUSE HE SUFFERS DREADFULLY AS A CONSEQUENCE OF NOT BEING ABLE TO FULFILL HIS RESPONSIBILITY WELL THAT'S FOR MEN
YOU1000000125_S0000073	WOMEN HAVE THEIR SETS OF RESPONSIBILITIES THEY'RE NOT THE SAME RIGHT BECAUSE THEY'RE COMPLICATED BECAUSE WOMEN OF COURSE HAVE TO TAKE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY
YOU1000000125_S0000074	FOR HAVING INFANTS AT LEAST BUT THEN ALSO FOR CARING FOR THEM THEY'RE THEY'RE STRUCTURED DIFFERENTLY THAN MEN
YOU1000000125_S0000076	FOR BIOLOGICAL NECESSITY EVEN IF IT'S NOT A PSYCHOLOGICAL ISSUE AND IT'S ALSO PARTLY A PSYCHOLOGICAL ISSUE WOMEN KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO MEN HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY HAVE
YOU1000000125_S0000077	AND IF THEY HAVE NOTHING WORTH LIVING FOR THEN THEY STAY PETER PAN
YOU1000000125_S0000079	WHY THE HELL NOT
YOU1000000125_S0000081	BECAUSE THE ALTERNATIVE TO VALUED RESPONSIBILITY IS
YOU1000000125_S0000083	IMPULSIVE LOW CLASS PLEASURE AND YOU SAW THAT IN THE PINOCCHIO STORY RIGHT THAT'S PLEASURE ISLAND IT'S LIKE WELL WHY LIFT A LOAD IF THERE'S NOTHING IN IT FOR YOU
YOU1000000125_S0000085	THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT WE'RE DOING TO MEN THAT'S A VERY BAD IDEA AND TO BOYS
YOU1000000125_S0000087	YOU'RE PATHOLOGICAL AND OPPRESSIVE IT'S LIKE FINE THEN WHY THE HELL AM I GOING TO PLAY IF THAT'S IF THAT'S THE SITUATION IF I GET NO CREDIT FOR BEARING RESPONSIBILITY
YOU1000000125_S0000088	BLOODY WELL BE SURE I'M NOT GOING TO BEAR ANY BUT THEN YOU KNOW YOUR LIFE IS USELESS AND MEANINGLESS AND YOU HAVE YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE FULL OF SELF CONTEMPT AND NIHILISM AND
YOU1000000125_S0000089	AND THAT'S NOT GOOD AND SO THAT'S WHY I THINK THAT'S WHAT I THINK'S GOING ON AT A DEEPER LEVEL WITH REGARDS TO MEN NEEDING THIS DIRECTION
YOU1000000125_S0000090	A MAN HAS TO DECIDE THAT HE'S GOING TO DO SOMETHING HE HAS TO DECIDE THAT
YOU1000000125_S0000091	YEAH WELL YOU KNOW PARTLY WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IN THE FUTURE AUTHORING PROCESS IS SAY OKAY WELL WHAT'S YOUR HIGHEST VALUE RIGHT IT'S THE STAR IT'S LIKE OKAY WHAT ARE YOU AIMING FOR
YOU1000000125_S0000092	YOU CAN DECIDE MAN BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME CRITERIA IT SHOULD BE GOOD FOR YOU IT SHOULD BE GOOD FOR YOU IN A WAY THAT FACILITATES YOU MOVING FORWARD
YOU1000000125_S0000093	MAYBE IT SHOULD BE GOOD FOR YOU IN A WAY THAT'S ALSO GOOD FOR THE FAMILY AND THE COMMUNITY IT SHOULD COVER THE DOMAIN OF LIFE
YOU1000000125_S0000094	I MEAN THERE'S CONSTRAINTS ON WHAT YOU SHOULD REGARD AS A VALUE BUT YOU BUT WITHIN THOSE CONSTRAINTS YOU HAVE THE
YOU1000000125_S0000096	CHOICE YOU HAVE CHOICE WELL THE THING IS IS THAT PEOPLE WILL CARRY A HEAVY LOAD IF THEY GET TO PICK THE GODDAMN LOAD
YOU1000000125_S0000098	SO AND THEY THINK WELL I DON'T CARRY ANY LOAD IT'S LIKE OKAY FINE BUT THEN YOU'RE LIKE THE SLED DOG THAT DOESN'T HAVE A SLED TO PULL YOU'RE JUST GONNA
YOU1000000125_S0000099	YOU'RE GONNA TEAR PIECES OUT OF YOUR OWN LEGS BECAUSE YOU'RE BORED YOU KNOW YOU NEED PEOPLE ARE PACK ANIMALS THEY NEED THEY NEED TO PULL AGAINST A WEIGHT
YOU1000000125_S0000100	AND AND THAT'S NOT TRUE FOR EVERYONE IT'S NOT TRUE PARTICULARLY SAY FOR LOW CONSCIENTIOUS PEOPLE I MEAN MAYBE THEY'RE OPEN AND CREATIVE OR EXTROVERTED IN SOME OTHER THINGS
YOU1000000125_S0000101	FOR THE FOR THE TYPICAL PERSON

YOU1000000126_S0000020	
YOU1000000126_S0000022	LISTENING TO ALL OF THE PRESENTATIONS FROM EARLIER TODAY I FEEL THAT
YOU1000000126_S0000024	BECAUSE OF THE RISE OF COVID
YOU1000000126_S0000026	HERE IS NOT A FORK IN THE ROAD FOR HIGHER EDUCATION
YOU1000000126_S0000028	SOCIETY IS CRYING OUT TO US FOR HOPE AND WE AS A COMMUNITY HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO HELP A LOT OF PEOPLE MAYBE NOT EVERYONE BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE
YOU1000000126_S0000030	THE CHOICES WE MAKE IN THIS COMMUNITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION COMMUNITY THE CHOICES WE MAKE OVER THE NEXT YEAR WILL STAY WITH US FOR DECADES TO COME
YOU1000000126_S0000032	ONLINE EDUCATION MOVEMENT HAS BEEN BUILDING FOR A DECADE OR MAYBE MANY DECADES
YOU1000000126_S0000033	SOME OF YOU KNOW ABOUT THE STARTING OF COURSE WHERE WE HAVE STARTED WITH TWO CAUSES OF STANFORD THE MACHINE LEARNING CLASS THAT I TAUGHT AND THE DATABASES CASE
YOU1000000126_S0000034	TAUGHT BY MY FRIEND JENNIFER ODOM
YOU1000000126_S0000035	AND IN THE NOT QUITE DECADE SINCE THEN THE NUMBER OF CAUSES HAS GROWN FROM TWO TO OVER FOUR THOUSAND ON COURSERA AND AN EVEN LARGER NUMBER WORLDWIDE
YOU1000000126_S0000037	SO THIS HAS BEEN GROWING FOR A LONG TIME AND ALL OF YOU OUR COMMUNITY HAS BEEN LEARNING FIGURING OUT HOW TO TEACH ONLINE
YOU1000000126_S0000039	
YOU1000000126_S0000041	COVID IS ACCELERATING EVERYTHING
YOU1000000126_S0000043	WE'VE SEEN HOW MANY WORKERS ARE HIT BY COVID ESPECIALLY THE ONES WITH WITHOUT A DEGREE
YOU1000000126_S0000045	WE HAVE SEEN HOW MORE PEOPLE ARE TAKING ONLINE COURSES TO HELP SELF ISOLATION TO LEARN ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH
YOU1000000126_S0000047	COVID IS ALSO CREATING UNIQUE CHALLENGES TO INSTITUTIONS WASHINGTON POST NEW YORK TIMES REPORTED COLLEGE STUDENTS REBELLING AGAINST FULL TUITION AFTER CLASSES MOVE ONLINE
YOU1000000126_S0000048	AND I WAS GRATIFIED WHEN I HEARD MATTHEW IN THE PANEL JUST NOW TALK ABOUT LOWER PRICING ANNOUNCING LOWER PRICING FOR THE SUMMER SESSION
YOU1000000126_S0000049	SO MANY OF THE TRENDS THAT HAVE BEEN UNDERWAY ARE ACCELERATED BY COVID AND WE ALL KNOW THAT SOCIETY IS HURTING
YOU1000000126_S0000050	THE IMF ESTIMATES THAT THE WORLD WILL EXPERIENCE THE WORST RECESSION SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION
YOU1000000126_S0000051	MOST OF US MANY OF US HAVE LIVED THROUGH THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS OF TWO THOUSAND NINE WHERE THE GLOBAL ECONOMY SHRANK BY POINT ONE PERCENT
YOU1000000126_S0000052	THIS TIME ROUND IT WILL SHRINK MUCH MORE BY ESTIMATES AND JUST IN THE US ALONE TWENTY TWO MILLION UNEMPLOYED IN A MATTER OF WEEKS
YOU1000000126_S0000053	AND PEOPLE PEOPLE ARE HURTING
YOU1000000126_S0000055	WE HAVE A BIG ROLE TO PLAY TO HELP MANY OF THESE PEOPLE
YOU1000000126_S0000057	
YOU1000000126_S0000059	COMPOUNDING TREND ON TREND TRUST AND EXPERTISE AND TRUST IN INSTITUTIONS HAS ALSO BEEN GOING DOWN NOT JUST FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS BUT FOR MANY YEARS NOW
YOU1000000126_S0000060	ADERMAN CARRIES OUT A LARGE ANNUAL VERY LARGE MULTI CITY SURVEY CALLED THE ADERMAN TRUST BAROMETER
YOU1000000126_S0000061	AND IN ONE OF THE RECENT STUDIES THEY PLOT
YOU1000000126_S0000064	DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONS ACCORDING TO HOW COMPETENT THEY ARE VIEWED AND HOW ETHICAL THEY ARE
YOU1000000126_S0000065	HORIZONTAL AXIS IS HOW COMPETENT IS AN INSTITUTION VERTICAL AXIS IS HOW ETHICAL IS AN INSTITUTION
YOU1000000126_S0000066	AND BUSINESSES ARE VIEWED AS QUITE COMPETENT BUT NOT ALWAYS THE MOST ETHICAL ON AVERAGE
YOU1000000126_S0000067	NGOS NON GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS ARE VIEWED AS RELATIVELY ETHICAL BUT NOT AS COMPETENT
YOU1000000126_S0000068	AND GOVERNMENT MEDIA ARE PERCEIVED BY CITIZENS ALL AROUND THE WORLD AS NEITHER NECESSARY COMPETENT NO ETHICAL
YOU1000000126_S0000069	I'M NOT SAYING THAT ANY OF THESE PERCEPTIONS ARE FAIR I THINK THERE ARE PLENTY OF HIGHLY COMPETENT AND HIGHLY ETHICAL INDIVIDUALS IN ALL OF THESE INSTITUTIONS
YOU1000000126_S0000070	BUT THIS IS THE PERCEPTION OF A LARGE SWATH OF SOCIETY AND WE HAVE A LACK OF INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE BROADLY PERCEIVED
YOU1000000126_S0000071	FAIRLY OR UNFAIRLY LACK OF INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE BROADLY PERCEIVED AS BOTH HIGHLY COMPETENT AND HIGHLY ETHICAL
YOU1000000126_S0000072	I WOULD QUITE LIKE FOR OUR INSTITUTIONS OF EDUCATION OUR INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION TO BE ABLE TO PLAY THAT ROLE
YOU1000000126_S0000073	THIS TRUST RATE DID NOT HAVE A NOTE SPECIFICALLY ON HIGHER EDUCATION BUT WE'VE ALL SEEN THE TRENDS AS EDUCATORS FOR MANY YEARS
YOU1000000126_S0000075	SO MAYBE IT'S NO SURPRISE THEREFORE THAT WITH THE RISE OF COVID WITH ALL OF THESE IMPACTS HIGHER EDUCATION IS IN CRISIS
YOU1000000126_S0000076	YOU'VE SEEN JUST IN THE LAST FEW RECENT PERIOD OF TIME ARTICLES WITH TITLES LIKE CRISIS IN HIGHER EDUCATION IN MY HOME STATE OF CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA'S HIGHER EDUCATION CRISIS
YOU1000000126_S0000077	FRIENDS OF AMERICAN HIGHER EDUCATION AND SO ON ON AND ON AND ON WE'RE SEEING ARTICLES LIKE THESE
YOU1000000126_S0000078	AND DID I SAY THAT THIS WAS CREATED BY THE COVID CRISIS ACTUALLY THESE ARTICLES WERE PUBLISHED WELL BEFORE THE COVID CRISIS
YOU1000000126_S0000079	SO IT'S STRANGE AND INTERESTING THAT THE FIELD OF HIGHER EDUCATION HAS BEEN IN CRISIS FOR ABOUT A DECADE NOW
YOU1000000126_S0000080	I THINK COVID IS ACCELERATING THIS CRISIS BUT IF WE WERE ALREADY IN THIS STATE EVEN BEFORE THE RECENT PANDEMIC
YOU1000000126_S0000081	I THINK THIS IS EVEN MORE TRUE NOW YOU KNOW THERE THERE IS I'M PROUD TO BE AN EDUCATOR EXCITED FOR DISCIPLINE VERY COMMITTED TO EDUCATION
YOU1000000126_S0000082	BUT I WOULD QUITE LIKE TO DO SOMETHING SO THAT MAYBE BY THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE MAYBE WE ALL WORK REALLY HARD FOR A FEW YEARS AND AND NOT BE IN PRICES
YOU1000000126_S0000083	ANYMORE A FEW YEARS FROM NOW DOES SEEM LIKE THE HEALTHIEST STATE FOR INDUSTRY TO BE TO HAVE IN PRICES FOR SO LONG
YOU1000000126_S0000084	BUT TO ME I THINK THIS POPULAR REFLECTION OF OF THE STATE OF CRISIS IS IS MAYBE A SIGN THAT
YOU1000000126_S0000085	DESPITE ALL THE VERY POSITIVE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WE HAVE AND THAT WE'RE STRIVING TO MAKE THAT THERE'S A POTENTIAL FOR US TO DO EVEN BETTER
YOU1000000126_S0000087	ONE OF THE DOCUMENTS THAT MOVED ME THE MOST IS THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS
YOU1000000126_S0000088	I FIRST READ THIS DOCUMENT WHEN I WAS A YOUNG ASSISTANT PROFESSOR AT STANFORD AND IT REALLY MOVED ME THE FIRST TIME I READ THIS
YOU1000000126_S0000089	BUT QUOTING FROM ARTICLE TWENTY SIX IT SAYS WE WE AS A SOCIETY DECLARED IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT
YOU1000000126_S0000090	THAT WAS THE YEAR MY FATHER WAS BORN SEVENTY TWO YEARS AGO
YOU1000000126_S0000091	SOCIETY DECIDED THAT EVERYONE HAS A RIGHT TO EDUCATION
YOU1000000126_S0000092	EDUCATION SHOULD BE FREE AT LEAST INTENTION FUNDAMENTAL STAGES TECH AND PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION GENERALLY AVAILABLE
YOU1000000126_S0000093	AND HIGHER EDUCATION SHALL BE EQUALLY ACCESSIBLE TO ALL ON THE BASIS OF MERIT
YOU1000000126_S0000094	SADLY DESPITE THIS PROUD DECLARATION THIS BEAUTIFUL DECLARATION THAT WE MADE AS A SOCIETY SEVENTY TWO YEARS AGO
YOU1000000126_S0000095	THIS STILL ISN'T THE REALITY WE LIVE IN TODAY
YOU1000000126_S0000096	AND EDUCATION IS LIMITED BY GEOGRAPHY BY SOCIAL ECONOMIC LIMITATIONS BY POLITICAL RESTRICTIONS
YOU1000000126_S0000097	THESE RESTRICTIONS HAVE ALREADY BEEN MAKING IT HARD FOR STUDENTS TO GET AN EDUCATION AND IT'S BECOME EVEN HARDER JUST IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS
YOU1000000126_S0000098	JUST LAST NIGHT THE UNITED STATES PRESIDENT TWEETED OUT ABOUT SUSPENDING IMMIGRATION TO UNITED STATES
YOU1000000126_S0000099	AND I HAVE NO IDEA HOW THIS WILL AFFECT MANY OF OUR STUDENTS THAT HAVE BEEN OR ARE COUNTING ON MAYBE COMING TO THE UNITED STATES
YOU1000000126_S0000100	FOR THEIR FOR THEIR STUDIES
YOU1000000126_S0000101	AND EVEN SIMONE AND OUTSIDE UNITED STATES SIMON FROM IMPERIAL ON THE PANEL MENTIONED JUST NOW PEOPLE FIND IT HARD TO GET TO LONDON
YOU1000000126_S0000102	THIS IS TRUE NOT JUST IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN THE UK BUT ALL AROUND THE WORLD AND COVID IS ACCELERATING TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS LIKE CRAZY
YOU1000000126_S0000103	I THINK IT'S UP TO ALL OF US USE THE DIGITAL REALM TO MAKE SURE THAT EDUCATION BECOMES MORE RATHER THAN LESS ACCESSIBLE
YOU1000000126_S0000105	AMIDST ALL OF THIS DOOM AND GLOOM AMIDST ALL OF THESE CHALLENGES WE FACE THERE IS A MASSIVE SILVER LINING
YOU1000000126_S0000106	I THINK SILVER LINING IS THAT THIS GROWING ACCEPTANCE OF THE VIRTUAL WORLD OF ONLINE EDUCATION
YOU1000000126_S0000107	AND WE'RE ALSO REALLY LUCKY THAT WE WORK IN AN INDUSTRY SECTOR THAT IN EDUCATION A LOT OF OUR WORK CAN MOVE ON
YOU1000000126_S0000108	NOT ALL OF IT NOT EASILY BUT A LOT OF OUR WORK CAN MOVE ONLINE
YOU1000000126_S0000109	SO AS AN EDUCATOR I FEEL A SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR US TO LEAD THIS CHANGE AND TO PLAY THE ROLE THAT ALL OF US
YOU1000000126_S0000111	THAT ALL OF YOU CAN PLAY TO HELP THE REST OF SOCIETY
YOU1000000126_S0000113	AND PART OF THE SILVER LINING IS THAT EVEN WITH EVERYTHING GOING ON AROUND THE WORLD
YOU1000000126_S0000114	I SEE THAT PEOPLE WANT TO FEEL EMPOWERED DESPITE THE UNEMPLOYMENT DESPITE THE UNCERTAINTY AROUND THE WORLD
YOU1000000126_S0000115	PEOPLE WAKE UP IN THE MORNING WANTING TO HAVE PRODUCTIVE QUARANTINE MORNINGS AND AFTERNOONS AND EVENINGS AND
YOU1000000126_S0000117	JEFF SHOWED THIS PICTURE OF A RAPID RISE IN NEW USER ENROLLMENTS AND THIS IS NOT A SHORT TERM TREND THAT WILL BE OVER WHEN COVID DIES DOWN
YOU1000000126_S0000118	THIS GROWTH IN ONLINE EDUCATION HAS BEEN A LONG TERM TREND BUT ONLY ACCELERATED BY COVID
YOU1000000126_S0000119	AND YOU KNOW WHAT WITH THESE MILLIONS OF LEARNERS ALL AROUND THE WORLD LEARNING NEW HABITS THEY'RE TEACHING THEMSELVES HOW TO LEARN ONLINE
YOU1000000126_S0000120	I FEEL LIKE AS AS AN INSTRUCTOR I'VE BEEN TEACHING MY STANFORD CLASSES ONLINE VIA ZOOM
YOU1000000126_S0000121	JUST AS I HAD TO LEARN NEW SKILLS OUR STUDENTS OUR LEARNERS ARE HAVING TO LEARN NEW SKILLS TO SUCCEED IN LEARNING ONLINE
YOU1000000126_S0000122	AND HOPEFULLY MORE COUNTRIES WILL EMERGE FROM LOCKDOWN SOON BUT EVEN WHEN ALL REOPEN OUR CAMPUSES
YOU1000000126_S0000123	WHEN SOCIAL DISTANCING CAN BE RELAXED
YOU1000000126_S0000124	THE SKILLS THAT THESE MILLIONS OR TENS OF MILLIONS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF ONLINE LEARNERS ARE LEARNING RIGHT NOW THEY WON'T FORGET THESE SKILLS
YOU1000000126_S0000125	AND THIS CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO KEEP ON USING THE DIGITAL MEDIUM TO KEEP ON SERVING THEM EVEN AFTER COVID IS OVER
YOU1000000126_S0000127	I LIKE THIS QUOTE BY ONE OF THE PARTNERS AT IT WHO SAID THAT THE VIRUS SEEMS LIKE AN ACCELERATOR DIGITAL CHANGE THAT WAS ALREADY UNDERWAY
YOU1000000126_S0000128	AND THAT THIS DIGITAL MINDSET WILL PERSIST AND IT'S HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT COMPANIES ALL UNIVERSITIES OR STUDENTS WILL TRY TO RETURN TO WHAT WORKED PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC
YOU1000000126_S0000129	PATRICK BROTHERS DURING THE PANEL ALSO SAID THAT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN WHAT WERE PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT MIGHT HAPPEN OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS
YOU1000000126_S0000130	WILL NOW MAYBE HAPPEN OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS
YOU1000000126_S0000131	AND ALL THIS CHANGE I FEEL LIKE DIGITAL PEDAGOGY IS STILL IN ITS INFANCY
YOU1000000126_S0000132	YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN TEACHING ONLINE FOR A LONG TIME EVEN PRACTICAL PUTTING VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE RUNNING LITTLE EXPERIMENTS MANY OF WHICH WENT FRANKLY WENT WENT NOWHERE BUT
YOU1000000126_S0000133	EVEN TODAY I FEEL THAT ONLINE PEDAGOGY THE WAY WE TEACH ONLINE INTERACTIVE LEARNERS IS STILL IN ITS INFANCY
YOU1000000126_S0000134	I'VE BEEN TEACHING MY ON CAMPUS I GUESS MY STANFORD CLASS USING FLIP CLASSROOM FOR MANY YEARS NOW
YOU1000000126_S0000135	WITH ONLINE DIGITAL CONTENT AUTO GRADING AND RECENTLY LIKE EVERYONE ELSE HAD TO MOVE THE LIVE PORTION OF THAT CLASS TO ZOOM
YOU1000000126_S0000136	AND I REALLY ENJOYED AND ON ONE HAND I MISS THE DEEPER YOU KNOW EMOTIONAL CONNECTION WITH LEARNERS
YOU1000000126_S0000137	SEEING PEOPLE IN THREE D AND GETTING SHAKE THEIR HANDS OFF THE CASE
YOU1000000126_S0000138	BUT ON THE FLIP SIDE I REALLY ENJOYED INTERACTING WITH MY STUDENTS IN REAL TIME VIA CHAT
YOU1000000126_S0000139	PREVIOUSLY WHEN I ASKED THE QUESTION IN CLASS ONE PERSON YOU WOULD GET THE ANSWER
YOU1000000126_S0000140	NOW I ROUTINELY ASK QUESTIONS IN ZOOM CHAT AND ASK EVERY SINGLE STUDENT IN THE CLASS ANSWER
YOU1000000126_S0000141	I REALLY LIKE THAT EVERYONE IN MY CLASSROOM DIGITAL CLASSROOM NOW GETS TO PARTICIPATE
YOU1000000126_S0000143	AND EVEN THOUGH THE WORLD'S BEEN DOING BEEN PARTICIPATING IN ONLINE EDUCATION FOR A LONG TIME YOU KNOW
YOU1000000126_S0000144	EIGHT YEARS OF COURSE THERE ARE MAYBE MANY DECADES AS A SOCIETY THERE IS STILL SO MUCH MORE WE CAN DO
YOU1000000126_S0000145	YOU HEARD KEN TALK ABOUT PEER GRADING USING MACHINE LEARNING
YOU1000000126_S0000146	I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE CASERA LABS FOR PROJECT GUIDED GUIDED PROJECT WORK FEATURES THAT NAME TALKS ABOUT SHAPING AND TALKS ABOUT MANY NEW PRODUCT FEATURES
YOU1000000126_S0000147	AND WHEN I LOOK AT WHERE ONLINE EDUCATION IS NOW AND HOW MUCH BETTER WE CAN MAKE THE EXPERIENCE STILL IN THE FUTURE
YOU1000000126_S0000148	I THINK THERE'S STILL SO MUCH TO DO AND I'M VERY CONFIDENT THAT FIVE YEARS FROM NOW WE'LL LOOK BACK AT THESE INCREDIBLY RUDIMENTARY THINGS WE'RE DOING BACK IN TWENTY TWENTY AND SAY
YOU1000000126_S0000149	WOW THOSE THINGS WE THOUGHT WERE SO ADVANCED IN TWENTY TWENTY BOY THAT WAS THAT WAS SO ANCIENT AND SO ARC
YOU1000000126_S0000150	AND WE CAN DELIVER SUCH A BETTER EXPERIENCE TO A LEARNER RIGHT NOW
YOU1000000126_S0000152	YOU KNOW I SAW WE SAW A NUMBER OF NEWSPAPER ARTICLES ABOUT THE SHORTAGE OF THICK SOLE PUZZLES
YOU1000000126_S0000153	YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF SOCIAL DISTANCING SHELTER IN PLACE THE WORLD DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH JIA PUZZLES AND YOU KNOW MAKING NEW JEX PUZZLES IS REALLY HARD IT'S REALLY COMPLICATED
YOU1000000126_S0000154	BUT THE NICE THING ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO TEACHING ONLINE IS
YOU1000000126_S0000155	IF IF WE HAVE DIGITAL PUZZLES THE SOFTWARE APPS DIGITAL PUZZLES THAT CAN BE REPLICATED AT SCALE VERY QUICKLY SO
YOU1000000126_S0000156	DIGITAL INNOVATION IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT AS WE INNOVATE AS WE COME NEW FORMS OF PEDAGOGY OUR COMMUNITY ALL OF YOU THE TEACHERS REPRESENTED HERE
YOU1000000126_S0000157	WE CAN QUICKLY TAKE THOSE IDEAS AND REPLICATE THAT TO LEARN ALL AROUND THE WORLD BECAUSE THE DIGITAL MEDIUM IS EASY TO SCALE
YOU1000000126_S0000159	SO WITH ALL OF THE CHALLENGES WE FACE AND WITH ALL OF THE OPPORTUNITIES
YOU1000000126_S0000161	THINK WE COME BACK TO THIS FORK IN THE ROAD
YOU1000000126_S0000163	WE DO FACE SIGNIFICANT THAT THE WORLD FACES SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES
YOU1000000126_S0000164	TED TALKS ABOUT UNIVERSITIES MAYBE AT A HIGHER RISK OF CLOSURE AND
YOU1000000126_S0000165	THE CHALLENGES THAT SOCIETY FACE AND THE CHALLENGES THAT ALL OF US IN HIGHER EDUCATION FACE IS CREATING A FORK IN THE ROAD
YOU1000000126_S0000166	ON ONE HAND WE COULD KEEP ON DOING BUSINESSES AS USUAL
YOU1000000126_S0000167	AND MAYBE SOME INSTITUTIONS WOULD BE OKAY WE DO HAVE VERY ROBUST SOME VERY ROBUST INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION
YOU1000000126_S0000168	AND MAYBE WE COULD HAVE INSTRUCTORS TEACH ON ZOOM BUT KEEP A LOT OF THINGS THE SAME AND MAYBE MAYBE SOME OF THE INSTITUTIONS WILL DO OKAY
YOU1000000126_S0000170	BUT I HOPE THAT ALL OF US WILL STEP UP AND RETHINK HOW WE CAN BEST BE HOPEFUL TO THE WORLD BECAUSE
YOU1000000126_S0000172	WITH SOCIETY IN CRISIS WITH SOCIETY REACHING OUT TO US FOR HELP WITH UNEMPLOYED LEARNERS WITH PEOPLE NEEDING HOPE
YOU1000000126_S0000173	GETTING AN EDUCATION BECAUSE LEARNING CANNOT STOP EVEN WHEN PEOPLE ARE AT HOME I THINK IT IS INCUMBENT ON ALL OF US
YOU1000000126_S0000174	AS LEADERS IN EDUCATION TO STEP UP AND RETHINK HOW WE CAN HELP THE WORLD
YOU1000000126_S0000176	I THINK THIS MAY BE A MOMENT THAT IF WE AS A COMMUNITY NO ONE OF US ALONE CAN DO THIS
YOU1000000126_S0000177	BUT WE AS A COMMUNITY CAN RETHINK HOW WE CAN USE DIGITAL TOOLS TO SERVE ALL OF THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE NEWLY WILLING TO ACCEPT DIGITAL LEARNING
YOU1000000126_S0000178	THEN THE OPPORTUNITY IS GREATER THAN EVER AND I HOPE WE CAN BUILD A WORLD BRIDGE A WORLD ACROSS TIME ZONES

YOU1000000127_S0000026	WE ARE TALKING MAYBE TO THE INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION WHERE THERE ARE NUMBERS OF THE PEOPLE KILLING THEMSELVES INTO MEDITERRANEAN TO JOIN THE EUROPE
YOU1000000127_S0000027	BUT THERE ARE HUGE NUMBERS OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERNAL DISPLACED YEAH WHO HAVE TO MOVE FROM ONE REGION TO ANOTHER ONE
YOU1000000127_S0000028	AND THAT CREATES THE CONFLICT AMONG THOSE COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE TO SHARE THE RESOURCES
YOU1000000127_S0000029	HOW CAN WE PROTECT AND SUPPORT THOSE WHO ARE DISPLACED
YOU1000000127_S0000031	WHAT THE MODEL DOES IS THAT IT HAS NOW MUCH MORE GRANULAR DATA ON POPULATION EXPOSURE WHICH GIVES A CLEARER SENSE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKELY TO BE TO BE DISPLACED BY FUTURE RIVERINE FLOODS
YOU1000000127_S0000032	AND IT ESTIMATES THAT ON AVERAGE WE CAN EXPECT TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE TO BE DISPLACED BY SUCH FLOODS IN AFRICA DURING ANY GIVEN YEAR IN THE FUTURE
YOU1000000127_S0000033	THE ARCTIC TEMPERATURE IS MORE THAN SEVEN DEGREES HIGHER THAN IT WAS ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO
YOU1000000127_S0000034	THIS HAS VAST IMPLICATIONS FOR EXAMPLE FLUTES TROPICAL STORMS DROUGHTS AROUND THE WORLD
YOU1000000127_S0000035	THIS SHOWS CLIMATE CHANGE IS FAR MORE THAN AN ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE
YOU1000000127_S0000036	IT HAS CRUCIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR THE ECONOMY FOR PEACE AND STABILITY FOR SECURITY AND MIGRATION POLICY
YOU1000000127_S0000037	IT HAS THEREFORE BECOME ONE OF THE DETERMINING FACTORS OF FOREIGN POLICY AT LARGE
YOU1000000127_S0000038	THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL NOT LAST IN AFRICA
YOU1000000127_S0000039	WE'RE ALSO DEALING WITH THE PROBLEM OF CLIMATE APARTHEID RIGHT NOW SO IN THE SENSE THAT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE PAYING THE FIRST AND MOST BRUTAL PRICE
YOU1000000127_S0000040	LOOK IN A PARTICULAR COLOR THOSE THAT HISTORICALLY CARRY THE BIGGEST WEIGHT OF THE SO
YOU1000000127_S0000041	WE OFTEN WONDER WHETHER IN FACT THE URGENCY WOULD BE MUCH MORE IF THERE WERE MORE URGENT
YOU1000000127_S0000042	IMMEDIATE IMPACTS HAPPENING IN EUROPE AND SO ON
YOU1000000127_S0000043	NOW THAT'S A VERY NEGATIVE STATEMENT TO START WITH BUT LET ME JUST TELL YOU
YOU1000000127_S0000044	BASICALLY THIS IS NO TIME FOR US TO BE BEING
YOU1000000127_S0000045	PALE PALE WITH EACH OTHER AND NOT TALKING ABOUT THE CONTRADICTIONS THAT EXIST AND NOT ACTUALLY GETTING
YOU1000000127_S0000046	ABSOLUTELY SERIOUS ABOUT SPEAKING TRUTH TO POWER WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME
YOU1000000127_S0000047	DEVELOPMENT IS BEING UNDERMINED BY CLIMATE CHANGE AND WE CANNOT IGNORE IT AND WE MUST ADDRESS IT AND WE MUST ADDRESS IT UPFRONT
YOU1000000127_S0000048	I REALLY THINK THAT WE HAVE ALSO TO STOP SEEING MIGRATION JUST NEGATIVELY
YOU1000000127_S0000049	AND THIS IS A KEY MESSAGE FROM MY SIDE I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK ALSO AT MIGRATION AS PART OF THE SOLUTION
YOU1000000127_S0000050	MOST OF THE TIME WE TALK BASICALLY ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE AS THE CAUSE FOR MIGRATION AND WE FRAME IT AS A PROBLEM
YOU1000000127_S0000051	AND WE RARELY LOOK AT THIS AS AS AN OPPORTUNITY AS AN ADAPTATION STRATEGY
YOU1000000127_S0000052	THE EUROPEAN IN AFRICA IS AN EXPAT AND THE AFRICAN IN EUROPE IS A MIGRANT IT CAN'T CONTINUE LIKE
YOU1000000127_S0000054	AUTHORITIES IN FREETOWN HAVE NOW DETERMINED TO PLANT A MILLION TREES BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO
YOU1000000127_S0000056	AND INCREASE VEGETATION IN THE CITY BY FIFTY PERCENT
YOU1000000127_S0000058	THAT WILL NOT ONLY HELP PROTECT RESIDENTS IN THE FUTURE BUT ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE
YOU1000000127_S0000060	IN ADDITION TO THESE COMMITMENTS AND FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF AFRICA THERE'S NEED
YOU1000000127_S0000062	FOCUS ON BUILDING RESILIENT SOCIETIES IN WHICH PEOPLE CAN ADAPT IN PLACE AND PROSPER
YOU1000000127_S0000063	SO THAT THERE IS NEED FOR CONTINUOUS MIGRATION IN THIS REGARD
YOU1000000127_S0000064	ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT REMAINS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY TO ADAPT TO CLIMATE CHANGE
YOU1000000127_S0000065	YOU CANNOT HAVE CLIMATE RESILIENCE WITHOUT ECONOMIC GROWTH WEALTH CREATION AND MASSIVE JOB EXPANSION
YOU1000000127_S0000066	AND ENERGY OF COURSE IS TIED TO EVERYTHING YOU NEED ENERGY FOR THE CLEAN WATER AND SANITATION IN CITIES
YOU1000000127_S0000067	YOU NEED ENERGY FOR THE LIGHTING TO DRIVE THE INDUSTRIES THAT WILL CREATE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AND GROWTH
YOU1000000127_S0000069	SO YOU BEGIN TO SEE THAT NEXUS BETWEEN ENERGY WATER AND SANITATION ENERGY AND HEALTH SERVICE DELIVERY
YOU1000000127_S0000070	THERE IS A REAL NEED FOR URBAN PLANNING URBAN POLICY WHICH IS ALIGNED TO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
YOU1000000127_S0000071	AND HOUSING STOCK RECOGNIZING THIS PHENOMENON OF URBANIZATION IS HERE TO STAY
YOU1000000127_S0000072	IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE AN INFLUX OF PEOPLE YOU NEED TO PLAN TO RECEIVE THEM YOU NEED TO PLAN TO DELIVER SERVICES
YOU1000000127_S0000073	I THINK THE CONTINENT NEEDS TO CLARIFY TO HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING ON WHERE IT WANTS TO GO WHAT IT NEEDS AND IT HAS TO DO
YOU1000000127_S0000074	IT HAS TO BE NOT ONLY A TOP DOWN APPROACH BUT ALSO BOTTOM UP APPROACH FULLY INFORMED BY THOSE
YOU1000000127_S0000075	SHOULD EUROPE TURN INTO EVEN MORE OF A FORTRESS
YOU1000000127_S0000077	OR SHOULD IT INSTEAD LOOK FOR MORE WAYS TO MAKE LEGAL MIGRATION FROM AFRICA POSSIBLE
YOU1000000127_S0000079	CLIMATE CHANGE IS A COMMON THREAT TO ALL OF US NO COUNTRY CAN WITHDRAW FROM THE EFFECTS OF GLOBAL WARMING
YOU1000000127_S0000080	PEOPLE LOSE THEIR ENTIRE EXISTENCE BECAUSE OF DISASTERS THE POLITICAL STABILITY OF WHOLE REGIONS IS AT STAKE
YOU1000000127_S0000081	TO WORK TOGETHER TO EASE THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE IS THEREFORE A QUESTION OF HUMANITY BUT ALSO OF POLITICAL RATIONALITY
YOU1000000127_S0000082	THIS STRATEGY IS ABOUT THE EU AND AFRICA JOINING FORCES IN A SOLID EQUAL PARTNERSHIP
YOU1000000127_S0000083	TO MAKE THE MOST OF THE GREEN AND THE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION
YOU1000000127_S0000085	TOGETHER WE CAN CREATE DECENT JOBS GOOD LIVELIHOODS WHILE ALSO TACKLING CLIMATE CHANGE
YOU1000000127_S0000086	CAN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY COME TOGETHER TO FACE THE IMMENSE CHALLENGES AHEAD
YOU1000000127_S0000088	THE UN TO REMAIN CREDIBLE THE SECURITY COUNCIL NEEDS TO CHANGE THE COMPOSITION OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL
YOU1000000127_S0000089	ACTUALLY REFLECT THE REALITIES AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR BUT IT DOESN'T REFLECT THE REALITY OF TODAY
YOU1000000127_S0000090	WE HAVE TO WORK NOT EUROCENTRIC BUT WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER WITH LIKE MINDED COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE TO SEE TO
YOU1000000127_S0000091	THAT THE RULES BASED INTERNATIONAL ORDER IS OBSERVED THIS CANNOT BE JUST DONE BY DONE BY ONE COUNTRY BY ONE PERSON
YOU1000000127_S0000092	NEVER LET A CRISIS GO TO WASTE THERE IS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ON WHERE WE CAN SEE HOW TO INDEED BETWEEN EUROPE AND AFRICA WORK TOGETHER
YOU1000000127_S0000093	TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES BY SHARING BEST PRACTICES BY SHARING EXPERIENCES AND BY LOOKING AT POTENTIAL PROSPECTS
YOU1000000127_S0000094	I THINK THAT GERMANY HAS TO DO MORE THIS IS EXACTLY MY EXPECTATION
YOU1000000127_S0000095	AND I'M CONVINCED THAT CLIMATE INDUCED MIGRATION IS AN ISSUE THAT URGENTLY NEEDS OPEN DIALOGUE
YOU1000000127_S0000096	BETWEEN COUNTRIES AND MULTILATERAL PLATFORMS TO CREATE SAFE PATHWAYS FOR MIGRATION
YOU1000000127_S0000097	TO CREATE A STATUS THAT PROTECTS THOSE WHO ARE LIKELY TO BECOME STATELESS
YOU1000000127_S0000098	THE ONLY FAILURE IS TO GIVE UP IT'S DOABLE WE CAN DO IT IT WAS DONE BEFORE
YOU1000000127_S0000099	THE THE THE KEY HERE IS TO DO IT DIFFERENTLY TO DO IT WITH WITH WITH CREATIVITY AND TO ENSURE THE NEEDED COMMITMENT
YOU1000000127_S0000100	IT'S IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE AND WE SHOULD PUT BACK PEOPLE AT THE HEART OF THE CLIMATE ACTION
YOU1000000127_S0000101	WHEN IT COMES TO THE CONTINENT A MOBILE CONTINENT IS A HEALTHY CONTINENT
YOU1000000127_S0000102	IT COMES TO WHEN IT COMES TO MOBILITY A MOBILE CONTINENT IS A RESOURCEFUL CONTINENT
YOU1000000127_S0000103	WE ALWAYS SAY NATURE IS EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE NATURE IS THE ONE WHO ARE GIVING US FOOD GIVING US MEDICINE EVEN THE MEDICINE IN THE PHARMACY
YOU1000000127_S0000104	SEVENTY PERCENT OF IT COMING FROM THE NATURE AND THEN MAYBE THIRTY PERCENT THAT FROM THE CHEMICAL
YOU1000000127_S0000105	THINGS THAT THEY ARE ADDING ONE BUT THE ASPIRATIONS AND ALL THE SUBSTANCE ARE COMING FROM NATURE
YOU1000000127_S0000107	AND FOOD ARE COMING FROM NATURE WE HAVE A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY FROM NOW TO THE NEXT NINE YEARS OR TEN YEARS
YOU1000000127_S0000108	TO INCREASE ALL THE AMBITIONS AND ACT NOW IF WE DIDN'T DO THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS NOW TURNING POINT
YOU1000000127_S0000110	IT'S TIME TO ACT
YOU1000000128_S0000003	GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYBODY IT IS LOVELY TO BE BACK MY NAME IS MABEL VANDOREN AND AS YOU MIGHT KNOW I'M A FORMER CO CHAIR OF HER AND I AM CURRENTLY CHAIR EMERITUS
YOU1000000128_S0000004	AND I'M REALLY REALLY EXCITED TO FACILITATE THIS CONVERSATION WITH GEORGE SOROS WHO AS YOU ALL KNOW IS THE MAN WHO PLAYED ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL ROLE IN THE CREATION OF CFR
YOU1000000128_S0000005	AND BEFORE I HAND THE FLOOR TO HIM I WANTED TO JUST MAYBE DRAW ATTENTION TO ONE OR TWO OF THE FEATURES THAT I FIND SO AMAZING OF GEORGE
YOU1000000128_S0000006	BECAUSE GEORGE IS SOMEBODY WHO IS ALWAYS AHEAD OF THE CURVE HE OFTEN SEES THINGS LONG BEFORE THE GENERAL PUBLIC ACTUALLY REALIZES THAT THEY'RE HAPPENING
YOU1000000128_S0000007	AND I AM THINKING FOR EXAMPLE ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE RECOGNIZED THE ECONOMIC CRISIS OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HE SAW IT COMING BEFORE IT EVEN HIT
YOU1000000128_S0000008	BUT ALSO I'M THINKING ABOUT AN ISSUE THAT HAS REALLY BEEN CLOSE TO HIS HEART FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS NOW I THINK WHICH IS CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM IN THE UNITED STATES
YOU1000000128_S0000009	HE'S BEEN WORKING ON TWENTY FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS ON THIS AND IT IS REALLY GOOD TO SEE THAT THAT THAT IS FINALLY GETTING MUCH MORE ATTENTION AS IT REALLY DESERVES
YOU1000000128_S0000011	GET US CLOSER TO HOME LET US GET US TO EUROPE AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE SEEN GEORGE DO TIME AND TIME AGAIN IN EUROPE IS SOMETHING THAT ALSO REALLY CHARACTER AND THAT IS STANDING UP FOR THE UNDERDOG
YOU1000000128_S0000012	AND I SAW HIM FIRST DO THAT IN THE EARLY NINETY S WHEN WE WERE WORKING ON THE WAR IN THE BALKANS BUT I'VE SEEN HIM DO THAT ALSO FOR EXAMPLE IN THE CASE OF THE ROMA
YOU1000000128_S0000013	AND OTHER MINORITIES ALL OVER OVER EUROPE REFUGEES ET CETERA SO WITH A MAN WHO'S ALWAYS WILLING TO PICK A GOOD FIGHT TO STAND UP FOR WHAT IS RIGHT AND TO SEE AHEAD
YOU1000000128_S0000014	AHEAD FAR SOONER THAN THAN MANY OF US CAN SEE I'M REALLY REALLY KEEN TO HEAR FROM HIM WHAT IS ON HIS MIND AND WHERE HE THINKS
YOU1000000128_S0000015	WE SHOULD ALL BE GOING GEORGE LET ME GIVE YOU THE FLOOR THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US
YOU1000000128_S0000017	THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYBODY
YOU1000000128_S0000019	WE LIVE IN A REVOLUTION IN HISTORY AT TIMES LIKE THESE THE RANGE OF POSSIBILITIES IS FAR GREATER THAN IN NORMAL TIMES
YOU1000000128_S0000021	EVENTS THAT ARE INCONCEIVABLE IN NORMAL TIMES NOT ONLY BECOME POSSIBLE BUT ACTUALLY HAPPEN
YOU1000000128_S0000023	I HAVE DEVELOPED AN ENTIRE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK BASED ON THE TWIN PILLARS OF FALLIBILITY AND REFLEXIVITY
YOU1000000128_S0000024	TO DEAL WITH SITUATIONS LIKE THE PRESENT
YOU1000000128_S0000026	THAT'S WHAT HAS ALLOWED ME TO MAKE A FORTUNE IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS
YOU1000000128_S0000028	IN THE VERY FIRST DAYS OF JANUARY OF THIS YEAR I REALIZED THAT WE HAD ENTERED A GLOBAL CRISIS THAT WOULD CHANGE THE DIRECTION OF HISTORY
YOU1000000128_S0000030	THAT'S WHEN IRANIAN GENERAL SOLEIMANI WAS ASSASSINATED IN IRAQ
YOU1000000128_S0000032	THAT TOLD ME
YOU1000000128_S0000033	THAT COUNTRIES WERE MORE INTERESTED IN FIGHTING EACH OTHER THAN IN FIGHTING CLIMATE CHANGE
YOU1000000128_S0000035	AS YOU KNOW CLIMATE CHANGE IS A GLOBAL PROBLEM AND IT REQUIRES GLOBAL COOPERATION TO BRING IT UNDER CONTROL
YOU1000000128_S0000037	THEN CAME THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS THAT TOTALLY DISRUPTED PEOPLE'S LIVES AND ADDED YET ANOTHER GLOBAL PROBLEM
YOU1000000128_S0000039	WHAT DIRECTION WILL HISTORY TAKE
YOU1000000128_S0000041	THAT'S A QUESTION NOBODY CAN ANSWER BECAUSE THE FUTURE DEPENDS ON DECISIONS THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN TAKEN
YOU1000000128_S0000043	NEVERTHELESS I BELIEVE MY OPEN SOCIETY FOUNDATIONS ARE WELL SITUATED TO DEVELOP STRATEGIES TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE
YOU1000000128_S0000045	I PERSONALLY HAVE FOCUSED ON AREAS WHERE I HAVE EXPERIENCED AND HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
YOU1000000128_S0000047	THAT LED ME TO TWO PARTICULAR ISSUES THAT ARE OF GLOBAL SIGNIFICANCE
YOU1000000128_S0000049	ONE IS THE PLAN
YOU1000000128_S0000051	FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND TO ISSUE A NEW ROUND OF SPECIAL DRAWING RIGHTS
YOU1000000128_S0000053	AND TO PERSUADE RICH COUNTRIES TO TO DONATE THEIR ALLOCATIONS WHICH THEY DON'T NEED TO POOR COUNTRIES THAT ARE DESPERATE FOR THEM
YOU1000000128_S0000055	TO EXPLAIN THE IDEA BETTER
YOU1000000128_S0000057	SPECIAL DRAWING RIGHTS ARE SYNTHETIC MONEY CREATED BY THE IMF
YOU1000000128_S0000059	STARS ARE ALLOCATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MEMBER COUNTRIES SHAREHOLDING IN THE IMF
YOU1000000128_S0000061	RICH COUNTRIES DON'T NEED THEM BECAUSE THEY CAN RAISE ISSUE MONEY IN THEIR OWN NAME IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET
YOU1000000128_S0000063	THE CAPACITY OF OUR COUNTRIES TO DO SO IS EXTREMELY LIMITED
YOU1000000128_S0000064	THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR RICH COUNTRIES TO DONATE THEIR ALLOCATIONS TO POOR ONES
YOU1000000128_S0000066	AS REGARDS HISTORICAL
YOU1000000128_S0000068	I AM NOT SURE IF WE HAVE A TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY WHETHER WE HAVE LOST GEORGE
YOU1000000128_S0000070	THE CONNECTION WITH GEORGE
YOU1000000128_S0000072	I'M AFRAID WE HAVE LOST THE CONNECTION WITH GEORGE SO HOPEFULLY HE WILL HE WILL SOON COME BACK IN AND RECONNECT
YOU1000000128_S0000074	PLEASE BE PATIENT
YOU1000000128_S0000076	I'M SORRY I'M USING DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES
YOU1000000128_S0000079	THERE YOU ARE GEORGE THERE YOU'RE GEORGE YOU'RE BACK WE'RE RECONNECTED
YOU1000000128_S0000080	VERY GOOD
YOU1000000128_S0000082	NEVERTHELESS
YOU1000000128_S0000084	USUALLY ENDORSED THE IDEA AND ARGUED THAT THE BEST AND PERHAPS ONLY WAY TO RAISE ONE OR TWO TRILLION EUROS
YOU1000000128_S0000085	IS BY ISSUING PERPETUAL BONDS
YOU1000000128_S0000087	DISTINGUISHING FEATURE OF PERPETUAL BONDS IS THAT THE PRINCIPLE NEVER HAS TO BE REPAID ONLY THE ANNUAL INTEREST IS DUE
YOU1000000128_S0000089	THIS MAKES THEM VERY EFFICIENT
YOU1000000128_S0000091	THEY HAVE A COST BENEFIT RATIO THAT IS ALMOST TEN TIMES GREATER THAN THAT OF THE LONG TERM BONDS THAT THE COMMISSION IS PROPOSING TO USE
YOU1000000128_S0000093	THIS SOUNDS ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE BUT IT'S TRUE
YOU1000000128_S0000095	ASSUMING POINT FIVE PERCENT INTEREST
YOU1000000128_S0000097	WHICH IS QUITE GENEROUS IN THE CURRENT LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT
YOU1000000128_S0000099	ONE TRILLION EUROS WOULD COST ONLY FIVE BILLION ANNUALLY
YOU1000000128_S0000101	THE INTEREST WOULD HAVE TO BE FOREVER BE PAID FOREVER BUT THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE PAYMENTS DIMINISHES PROGRESSIVELY
YOU1000000128_S0000102	UNTIL IT APPROACHES BUT DOESN'T QUITE REACH ZERO
YOU1000000128_S0000104	MOST IMPORTANTLY PERPETUAL BONDS COULD BE ISSUED AS SOON AS MEMBER STATES AUTHORIZED SUFFICIENT OWN RESOURCES
YOU1000000128_S0000105	TO MAINTAIN THE TRIP RATING OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
YOU1000000128_S0000107	OWN RESOURCES WOULD COME FROM NEWLY AUTHORIZED TAXES SUCH AS A TAX ON CARBON EMISSIONS
YOU1000000128_S0000109	TAXES WOULD ONLY HAVE TO BE AUTHORIZED THEY WOULDN'T NEED TO BE IMPOSED
YOU1000000128_S0000110	BECAUSE THAT WOULD TAKE TOO LONG AND SPEED SPEED IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE
YOU1000000128_S0000112	THE PROFESSIONAL BONDS DON'T NEED TO BE ISSUED IN ONE GO THEY COULD BE SOLD IN TRANCES
YOU1000000128_S0000114	THE FIRST TRANCHES WOULD BE SNATCHED UP BY INSURANCE COMPANIES AND OTHER LONG TERM INVESTORS
YOU1000000128_S0000115	WHO ARE STARVED OF ASSETS TO MATCH THEIR LIABILITIES
YOU1000000128_S0000117	AS THE MARKET FAMILIARIZE THEMSELVES WITH THE NEW INSTRUMENT OTHER INVESTORS WOULD BE ATTRACTED TO IT
YOU1000000128_S0000119	AND THE BOND MARKET AS THE BONDS BECAME ACTIVELY ACTIVELY TRADED
YOU1000000128_S0000121	EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK WOULD ALSO BE ALLOWED TO INVEST IN THEM
YOU1000000128_S0000123	THERE IS AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION BETWEEN FUNDS RAISED FROM THE EU'S OWN RESOURCES AND THOSE THAT ARE CONTRIBUTED BY MEMBER STATES
YOU1000000128_S0000125	THE LATTER HAVE TO BE DISTRIBUTED TO MEMBER STATES ACCORDING TO THEIR SHAREHOLDING IN THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK
YOU1000000128_S0000127	THE FORMER CAN BE GIVEN BY THE COMMISSION TO THOSE WHO MOST IN NEED
YOU1000000128_S0000129	THAT MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE AID THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION CAN PROVIDE
YOU1000000128_S0000130	FOR INSTANCE
YOU1000000128_S0000132	IT COULD ASSIST THOSE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR LIVELIHOOD BECAUSE OF THE VIRUS
YOU1000000128_S0000133	CURRENTLY THEY HAVE TO DEPEND ON THEIR OWN GOVERNMENTS WHOSE CAPACITIES VARY
YOU1000000128_S0000134	IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE EQUITABLE IF THE SUPPORT CAME FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION
YOU1000000128_S0000136	
YOU1000000128_S0000138	WHY MEMBER STATES IGNORE SO STUDIOUSLY AN INSTRUMENT THAT IS IDEALLY SUITED TO THE CURRENT SITUATION
YOU1000000128_S0000140	THEY WERE AWARE OF PERPETUAL BONDS BECAUSE SPAIN CHAMPIONED THEM AT A VIRTUAL SUMMIT OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL ON APRIL TWENTY THIRD
YOU1000000128_S0000141	AND THEY WERE LISTED AS ONE OF THE IDEAS THAT DESERVED FURTHER CONSIDERATION
YOU1000000128_S0000143	MY GUESS IS THAT THE PERPETUAL BONDS WERE DISMISSED OUT OF HAND
YOU1000000128_S0000144	BECAUSE THEY WERE CONFUSED WITH CORONA BONDS
YOU1000000128_S0000146	THE LATTER WERE DECISIVELY REJECTED BY MEMBER STATES BECAUSE SOME OF THEM WERE UNWILLING TO GO THAT FAR
YOU1000000128_S0000148	IN REALITY PERPETUAL BONDS ARE THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF CORONA BONDS
YOU1000000128_S0000150	PERPETUAL BONDS REDUCE THE DEBT BURDEN CORONA BONDS INCREASE IT
YOU1000000128_S0000152	TO AVOID CONFUSION AND TRY TO AVOID USING THE TERM PERPETUAL BONDS
YOU1000000128_S0000154	I PREFER TO USE THE WORD CONSOLES
YOU1000000128_S0000156	THAT'S THE NAME THE U K AND THE U S USED FOR CENTURIES TO DESERVE PERPETUAL TO DESCRIBE PERPETUAL BONDS
YOU1000000128_S0000158	UK STARTED IN SEVENTEEN FIFTY TWO AND THE U S IN EIGHTEEN IN THE EIGHTEEN SEVENTY S
YOU1000000128_S0000160	INTERESTINGLY THE NETHERLANDS
YOU1000000128_S0000162	PREDATED THE OTHER TWO COUNTRIES
YOU1000000128_S0000164	A DUTCH WATER BOARD ISSUED PERPETUAL BONDS IN SIXTEEN FORTY EIGHT
YOU1000000128_S0000165	TO REPAIR A DYKE
YOU1000000128_S0000167	THE BONES ARE STILL OUTSTANDING
YOU1000000128_S0000168	BUT THE ANNUAL INTEREST HAS BECOME SO SMALL THAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC IS NOT EVEN AWARE OF THEIR CONTINUED EXISTENCE
YOU1000000128_S0000170	AS FAR AS I KNOW THE DUTCH ACTUALLY INVENTED THE IDEA
YOU1000000128_S0000171	YET TODAY THEY ARE THE MOST ARDENT OPPONENT
YOU1000000128_S0000172	THEY ARE THE LEADERS OF THE SO CALLED FRUGAL FOR
YOU1000000128_S0000174	IN SIXTEEN FORTY EIGHT THE NETHERLANDS FACED A SERIOUS THREAT FROM FLOODING
YOU1000000128_S0000176	TODAY THE COMBINATION OF THE VIRUS AND CLIMATE CHANGE POSES AN EVEN GREATER DANGER TO THE EUROPEAN UNION
YOU1000000128_S0000178	IT WOULD BE TRAGIC IF EUROPE IN GENERAL AND THE FRUGAL FOUR IN PARTICULAR FAIL TO GIVE CONSOLES THE CONSIDERATION THEY DESERVE
YOU1000000128_S0000180	I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE BOUND TO BE LEGAL OBJECTIONS
YOU1000000128_S0000181	BASED ON THE TFO THAT CONTAINS ALL THE RULES THAT GOVERN THE EUROPEAN UNION
YOU1000000128_S0000183	I BELIEVE THE OBJECTIONS COULD BE OVERCOME
YOU1000000128_S0000184	BY ARGUING THAT THE AUTHORS OF THE T WERE NOT AWARE OF THE EXISTENCE OF CONSOLES
YOU1000000128_S0000185	THEREFORE ITS REGULATIONS DOESN'T APPLY TO THEM
YOU1000000128_S0000187	ALSO ANTICIPATE
YOU1000000128_S0000189	MORAL OBJECTIONS FROM GERMAN SPEAKING PEOPLE
YOU1000000128_S0000190	THE GERMAN WORD SHE HAS A DOUBLE MEANING DEBT AND GUILT
YOU1000000128_S0000192	IT FOLLOWS THAT THAT DEBTS SHOULD BE THE DEBTORS SHOULD BE PUNISHED
YOU1000000128_S0000194	THAT MAKES PERPETUAL BONDS THAT NEVER HAVE TO BE REPAID MORALLY INADMISSIBLE
YOU1000000128_S0000196	THERE IS ONE LEGITIMATE LEGITIMATE OBJECTION THAT MAY BE RAISED
YOU1000000128_S0000198	ONCE YOU START USING CONSOLES YOU MAY END UP ABUSING THEM
YOU1000000128_S0000200	BUT THE FACT THAT THE LARGE SCALE USE OF EUROPE'S TRIPLE A CREDIT IS ALREADY DESIGNATED AS A TEMPORARY MEASURE
YOU1000000128_S0000202	THAT SHOULD BE SO SURE
YOU1000000128_S0000203	THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE USED IN NORMAL TIMES
YOU1000000128_S0000205	THEY OFFER A FINANCIAL TOOL IDEALLY SUITED TO THE CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES
YOU1000000128_S0000207	THEY WOULD NOT BE ABUSED IN NORMAL TIMES
YOU1000000128_S0000209	WHY ALL THIS HOSTILITY
YOU1000000128_S0000211	I BELIEVE THE ANSWER IS TO BE FOUND IN THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS
YOU1000000128_S0000213	THE COMMISSION WAS NOT AWARE OF PERPETUAL BONDS WHEN IT PROPOSED A RECOVERY PLAN
YOU1000000128_S0000215	IT WAS RELYING ON THE ONLY INSTRUMENT OVER WHICH IT HAD SOME CONTROL NAMELY THE BUDGET
YOU1000000128_S0000217	THAT FOCUSED THE ATTENTION OF MEMBER STATES AND INTEREST GROUPS
YOU1000000128_S0000218	ON HOW THE FUNDS ARE DISTRIBUTED NOT ON HOW THEY WERE GENERATED
YOU1000000128_S0000220	INTERESTED PARTIES ARE NOW HAGGLING WITH EACH OTHER
YOU1000000128_S0000221	FOR INSTANCE THE FRUGAL FOUR WANT TO PROTECT THEIR DISCOUNTS FROM THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE BUDGET
YOU1000000128_S0000223	IT WILL TAKE TIME FOR THE AUTHORITIES TO REALIZE THAT THE BUDGET CAN GENERATE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THE EUROPEAN UNION NEEDS
YOU1000000128_S0000225	THAT'S WHEN THE CONSOLES WILL BE RECOGNIZED
YOU1000000128_S0000226	AS AN INDISPENSABLE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT
YOU1000000128_S0000228	BUT BY THAT TIME IT MAY BE TOO LATE
YOU1000000128_S0000230	WE MUST THEREFORE ACCELERATE THE PROCESS
YOU1000000128_S0000232	MONEY IS NEEDED NOW
YOU1000000128_S0000238	AND SHE HAS FULLY RECOVERED HER POLITICAL INFLUENCE
YOU1000000128_S0000240	SHE ALSO HAS CAPABLE SUPPORTERS IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE
YOU1000000128_S0000242	UNDERSTAND THE MERITS OF COUNCIL
YOU1000000128_S0000244	IN ADDITION TO DEALING DEALING WITH THE VIRUS
YOU1000000128_S0000245	CONSOLE SHOULD ALSO BE USED TO ADDRESS GRAMMAR CHANGE
YOU1000000128_S0000247	RECENTLY A STRONG MOVEMENT HAS DEVELOPED
YOU1000000128_S0000249	TO RAISE THE TWENTY THIRTY CLIMATE TARGETS
YOU1000000128_S0000250	FROM FORTY PERCENT TO FIFTY FIVE PERCENT
YOU1000000128_S0000251	A NUMBER OF MAINLY EAST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE OBJECTING THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO MEET THE HIGHER TARGET
YOU1000000128_S0000253	THAT COULD BE READILY REMEDIED WITH AN ADDITIONAL TRILLION EUROS OF CONSOLES
YOU1000000128_S0000254	OF COURSE THE COMMISSION WOULD HAVE TO CAREFULLY MONITOR THAT THE FUNDS ARE NOT MISDIRECTED AND MISUSED
YOU1000000128_S0000256	IN THIS WAY THE EUROPEAN UNION COULD MEET THE TWO GREAT CHALLENGES OF OUR TIME
YOU1000000128_S0000257	AND FULFILL THE EXPECTATIONS OF ITS CITIZENS THAT WOULD BE A TRULY GREAT ACCOMPLISHMENT THANK YOU
YOU1000000129_S0000000	THERE ARE BUT FEW MEN IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY WHO HAVE ACCUMULATED FORTUNES LIKE THAT OF ANDREW CARNEGIE A MAN WHO WAS AS COMPLEX AS HE WAS RICH
YOU1000000129_S0000001	AFTER SELLING HIS COMPANY HIS NET WORTH WOULD EQUAL A STAGGERING TWO PERCENT OF AMERICA'S GDP
YOU1000000129_S0000002	IN TODAY'S VIDEO WE'LL EXPLORE HOW ONE SCOTTISH IMMIGRANT ARMED WITH JUST FIVE YEARS OF SCHOOLING WOULD RISE FROM POVERTY TO THE STATUS OF THE WORLD'S RICHEST MAN
YOU1000000129_S0000004	THIS VIDEO WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE IF IT WASN'T FOR OUR FRIENDS AT ACORNS AN INVESTMENT APP WITH OVER SIX MILLION USERS THAT MAKES INVESTING AS EASY AS SPENDING

YOU1000000129_S0000006	THAT'S FREE MONEY TO HELP YOU GET STARTED WITH INVESTING SO BE SURE TO CHECK THEM OUT THE LINK IS IN THE VIDEO DESCRIPTION BELOW
YOU1000000129_S0000008	CARNEGIE WAS AT ONE POINT THE RICHEST AMERICAN IN HISTORY BUT HE WASN'T BORN IN AMERICA
YOU1000000129_S0000009	ANDREW'S STORY BEGINS ACROSS THE ATLANTIC OCEAN IN DUNFERMLINE SCOTLAND WHERE HE GREW UP IN WHAT COULD ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS ABJECT POVERTY
YOU1000000129_S0000010	HIS MOTHER WOULD WORK AROUND THE CLOCK SEWING SHOES HIS FATHER WOULD MAKE CLOTH AND OTHER MATERIAL AND WEAVING LOOMS
YOU1000000129_S0000011	THAT WAS OF COURSE UNTIL THE STEAM POWERED LOOM CAME INTO THE PICTURE WITH WEAVING TECHNOLOGY RAPIDLY IMPROVING HIS FATHER'S LOOM BUSINESS WOULD CRUMBLE FINDING HIMSELF CRUSHED BY THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION
YOU1000000129_S0000012	WATCHING HIS FATHER SUFFER AS HE BEGGED FOR WORK WOULD IMPACT THE YOUNG CARNEGIE PROFOUNDLY IN EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT THE CARNEGIES SET OUT IN SEARCH OF A BETTER LIFE OUTSIDE SCOTLAND AFTER SELLING ALL OF THEIR POSSESSIONS AND BORROWING TWENTY POUNDS
YOU1000000129_S0000013	THE FAMILY EMBARKED ON THEIR JOURNEY TO THE LAND OF OPPORTUNITY AMERICA THEY WOULD RESTART THEIR LIVES FROM SCRATCH IN PITTSBURGH THE HUB OF MANUFACTURING BUT STILL FOUND THEMSELVES UNABLE TO ESCAPE HARDSHIP IN THEIR NEW COUNTRY
YOU1000000129_S0000014	HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BOTH STRUGGLED TO FIND WORK LEAVING ANDREW NO CHOICE BUT TO DROP OUT OF SCHOOL TO SUPPORT HIS FAMILY HE WOULD FINALLY CATCH A BREAK FROM THE SCORCHING HEAT OF THE BOILER ROOMS WHEN HE LANDED A JOB AT A LOCAL TELEGRAPH OFFICE
YOU1000000129_S0000015	AS A MESSENGER BOY HE WOULD DELIVER TELEGRAMS BY BIKE ALL OVER PITTSBURGH HE WOULD MEMORIZE THE FACES OF EVERYONE HE DELIVERED TO SO THAT HE COULD GREET THEM BY NAME IF HE SAW THEM OUTSIDE OF WORK
YOU1000000129_S0000016	IT WOULD PROVIDE CARNAGE WITH A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO FAMILIARIZE HIMSELF WITH THE CITY'S BUSINESS COMMUNITY AT SEVENTEEN HE WOULD PERFECT HIS TELEGRAPH SKILLS HE WOULD GROW INCREASINGLY SKILLED AT HEARING MORSE CODE
YOU1000000129_S0000017	IMPRESSIVELY HE COULD RECITE MESSAGES WITHOUT NEEDING TO WRITE THEM DOWN THIS CAUGHT THE EYE OF THOMAS SCOTT A REGIONAL MANAGER FOR THE PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD COMPANY WHO HIRED CARNEGIE TO BE HIS PERSONAL TELEGRAPHER
YOU1000000129_S0000018	AND PRIVATE SECRETARY FOR THE SUM OF THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH AT THE TIME PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD COMPANY WAS THE LARGEST CORPORATION IN THE WORLD
YOU1000000129_S0000019	FOR THE BUSINESS SAVVY CARNEGIE IT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE NONE OTHER A FRONT ROW SEAT ON HOW TO RUN A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS
YOU1000000129_S0000020	TOM SCOTT HIS BOSS REALIZED CARNEGIE'S POTENTIAL AND DECIDED TO TAKE THE BOY UNDER HIS WING MENTORING HIM LIKE A SECOND FATHER
YOU1000000129_S0000021	IT WOULD LATER BE TOM'S ADVICE TO INVEST IN STOCKS THAT PROVIDED CARNEGIE WITH HIS FIRST TASTE OF CAPITALISM FAST FORWARD TO THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR CARNAGE IS DRAFTED INTO THE UNION BUT INSTEAD OF FIGHTING IN THE WAR
YOU1000000129_S0000022	CARNEGIE WOULD PROFIT FROM IT HE WAS ABLE TO ESCAPE HARM'S WAY AFTER PAYING EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS FOR A SUBSTITUTE TO TAKE HIS PLACE ON THE BATTLEFIELD IT WAS DURING THIS TIME THAT CARNAGE NOTICED THAT THE WOODEN BRIDGES WERE EASILY BURNT BY THE TROOPS
YOU1000000129_S0000023	AND THAT THERE WAS A DESPERATE NEED FOR IRON BRIDGES TO REPLACE THEM HE CAPITALIZED ON THE OPPORTUNITY LAUNCHING THE KEYSTONE BRIDGE COMPANY BUT IT WOULD BE HIS NEXT MOVE THAT WOULD DEFINE HIM AS AN ASTUTE BUSINESSMAN
YOU1000000129_S0000024	KEYSTONE DIDN'T JUST BUILD BRIDGES THEY ALSO HAD THEIR VERY OWN IRON MILLS WHICH PROVIDED THE IRON THAT WAS NEEDED FOR CONSTRUCTING THE BRIDGES
YOU1000000129_S0000025	OWNING THE IRON SOURCE MEANT THAT CARNEGIE'S BRIDGE BUILDING COMPANY WOULD NOT BE DEPENDENT ON MINING OR EXTRACTING COMPANIES FOR IRON LIKE THEIR COMPETITORS THIS NOT ONLY GAVE CARNEGIE MORE CONTROL OVER THE ENTIRE PROCESS IT ALSO IMPROVED THEIR MARGINS
YOU1000000129_S0000026	AFTER THE BRIDGE WAS BUILT HE WOULD LEVERAGE HIS CONNECTIONS IN THE RAILROAD INDUSTRY TO MAKE MONEY THERE TOO ESSENTIALLY HE WAS OPERATING A TRIAD OF THREE COMPANIES EACH STRENGTHENING ONE ANOTHER
YOU1000000129_S0000027	FIRST A MINING EXTRACTION COMPANY SECOND A BRIDGE BUILDING COMPANY WHICH USED THE IRON PROVIDED FROM HIS MINING COMPANY AND THEN ONCE THE BRIDGE WAS BUILT HIS THIRD BUSINESS WOULD MONETIZE BY SELLING RAIL
YOU1000000129_S0000028	THE CONCEPT WORKED TO A T
YOU1000000129_S0000029	ALWAYS LOOKING FOR THE NEXT BIG OPPORTUNITY ANDREW SET HIS SIGHTS ON NEW YORK CITY THE UNDISPUTED BUSINESS CAPITAL OF THE WORLD IN THE CITY HE EXPECTED TO FIND A HUSTLING CULTURE AND MINGLE WITH OTHER DISTINGUISHED BUSINESSMEN
YOU1000000129_S0000030	BUT WHAT HE FOUND INSTEAD WAS DISAPPOINTMENT HE WOULD DESCRIBE THE WEALTHY INDIVIDUALS AROUND HIM AS SCOUNDRELS
YOU1000000129_S0000031	CARNEGIE WROTE A NOTE TO HIMSELF PROMISING THAT IN TWO YEARS WHEN HE TURNED THIRTY FIVE HE WOULD RETIRE AND FOCUS ON MAKING THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE
YOU1000000129_S0000032	BUT THIS NOTE WOULD GO UNFULFILLED IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX A NEW INVENTION BY HENRY BESEMER CALLED THE BESEMER CONVERTER
YOU1000000129_S0000034	PEAR SHAPED FURNACE WOULD ALLOW FOR THE MASS PRODUCTION OF STEEL SOMETHING PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT TO BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER IT WOULD FINALLY BECOME FEASIBLE TO CREATE LARGE STRUCTURES FROM STEEL
YOU1000000129_S0000035	EVENTUALLY GIVING BIRTH TO THE FIRST SKYSCRAPERS FOREVER TRANSFORMING A CITY SKYLINE CARNEGIE MOVED WITH LIGHTNING SPEED SUCCESSFULLY BUILDING AMERICA'S FIRST STEEL PLANTS
YOU1000000129_S0000036	IN DOING SO HE HIRED THE BEST ENGINEERS AND ARCHITECTS THAT MONEY COULD BUY HE FOCUSED MANIACALLY ON INCREASING EFFICIENCY ALWAYS USING THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY AND PUSHING HIS EMPLOYEES TO THEIR MAXIMUM PHYSICAL AND MENTAL CAPABILITIES
YOU1000000129_S0000037	HE WAS ALSO NOTORIOUS FOR REQUIRING EMPLOYEES TO WORK THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR DAYS A YEAR ONLY ALLOWING FOR REST ON THE FOURTH OF JULY
YOU1000000129_S0000038	AS TECHNOLOGY CONTINUED TO ADVANCE HE WOULD SEEK WAYS TO REPLACE HIS WORKERS WITH MACHINES AT EVERY POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY
YOU1000000129_S0000039	UNLIKE MEN MACHINES DIDN'T NEED SLEEP THEY ALSO DIDN'T ASK FOR RAZORS AND THEY CERTAINLY DID NOT TRY TO UNIONIZE
YOU1000000129_S0000040	CARNEGIE A MASTER SALESMAN DECIDED TO NAME THE VENTURE NOT CARNEGIE STEEL BUT RATHER EDGAR THOMPSON STEELWORKS THE NAME OF ONE OF HIS CUSTOMERS IN THE RAILROAD INDUSTRY
YOU1000000129_S0000041	CARNEGIE HOPED STEEL MILL NAMED AFTER A CUSTOMER WOULD SHOW HIS APPRECIATION FOR THEIR BUSINESS AND MAYBE EVEN SECURE MORE ORDERS FROM THEIR RAILROAD AND IT DID THE FIRST ORDER FROM THOMPSON CONSISTED OF TWO THOUSAND STEEL RAILS
YOU1000000129_S0000042	NAMING A MILL AFTER A CUSTOMER WAS MORE THAN A SALES GIMMICK IT WAS PART OF A LARGER STRATEGY SHOWING APPRECIATION IN PUBLIC FOR OTHERS
YOU1000000129_S0000043	ACTS LIKE THIS WOULD CONTINUE TO PAY MASSIVE DIVIDENDS THROUGHOUT THE TITANS CAREER TO HELP RUN CARNEGIE STEEL MILLS HE WOULD BRING ON BOARD A CUTTHROAT EXECUTIVE KNOWN FOR HIS RUTHLESSNESS AND ATTENTION TO THE BOTTOM LINE
YOU1000000129_S0000044	HENRY CLAY FRICK AS A TEAM CARNEGIE AND FRICK WERE A POWERFUL FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH AND TO SHOW HOW RUTHLESS THE TWO COULD BE LOOK NO FARTHER THAN THE STORY ABOUT DUCANE WORKS
YOU1000000129_S0000045	WITH THE HELP OF FRICK CARNAGE SPREAD A RUMOUR WHICH ALLEGED THAT DUCA'S MILL WAS PRODUCING DEFECTIVE STEEL IT WASN'T TRUE BUT IT DIDN'T MATTER
YOU1000000129_S0000046	CARNEGIE CLAIMED TO DUANE'S RAILROAD CUSTOMERS THAT THEIR RAILS LACKED WHAT HE CALLED HOMOGENEITY FEW IF ANY ONE ACTUALLY KNEW WHAT THE WORD MEANT BUT THAT WASN'T IMPORTANT
YOU1000000129_S0000047	CARNEGIE USED THE WORD BECAUSE IT SOUNDED SCARY ENOUGH TO FRIGHTEN OFF RAILROADS WHO WERE CONCERNED THAT THEY WEREN'T GETTING GOOD PRODUCTS IF DUCANE SALES SLOWED THEY WOULD EVENTUALLY BECOME UNPROFITABLE AND RUN OUT OF MONEY
YOU1000000129_S0000048	TO EXPEDITE THEIR DEMISE CARNACKI AND FRICK WOULD PROCEED TO UNDERCUT BUCHANON PRICE FURTHER SQUEEZING THE COMPANY
YOU1000000129_S0000049	WITHIN TWO YEARS DAN'S FINANCES WERE IN RUINS LEAVING IT NO OTHER CHOICE THAN TO SELL TO NONE OTHER THAN CARNAGE AT A BARGAIN PRICE
YOU1000000129_S0000050	FOR FRICK AND CARNAGE THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT WERE CLEAR DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO WIN BUT THIS RUTHLESSNESS CAME WITH A HEFTY PRICE AS THEY WOULD SOON DISCOVER AT ONE OF THEIR LARGEST STEEL PLANTS IN HOMESTEAD PENNSYLVANIA
YOU1000000129_S0000051	CARNEGIE HAD JUST INVESTED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OPTIMIZING THE EFFICIENCY OF HOMESTEAD ENABLING IT TO PRODUCE MORE STEEL THAN ANY OTHER MILL COMPARABLE TO ITS SIZE
YOU1000000129_S0000052	BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER PART OF THE PROFIT MACHINE THAT WAS YET TO BE OPTIMIZED LABOUR COSTS THIS POSED A PROBLEM FOR CARNEGIE WHO HAD BEEN WORKING ON REBRANDING HIS IMAGE FROM AN OPPRESSIVE STEEL FACTORY BILLIONAIRE TO A CHAMPION OF WORKERS' RIGHTS
YOU1000000129_S0000053	SO INSTEAD OF RISKING HIS REPUTATION HE WOULD HAVE HIS RIGHT HAND LIEUTENANT HENRY FRICK EXECUTE THE DIRTY WORK MEANWHILE CARNAGE WOULD DISTANCE HIMSELF TRAVELING ABROAD TO HIS HOME COUNTRY OF SCOTLAND
YOU1000000129_S0000054	CARNEGIE KNEW THAT HE WOULDN'T WANT TO BE AROUND THE PLANT AFTER CUTTING WAGES FOR TEN THOUSAND ALREADY FRUSTRATED LOW PAID WORKERS
YOU1000000129_S0000055	IN EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO TENSIONS BETWEEN WORKERS AND MILL OWNERS WERE PARTICULARLY HEIGHTENED AFTER AN EVER WIDENING WEALTH GAP CONTINUED TO GROW THE RICHEST PEOPLE IN AMERICA WERE ACCUMULATING FORTUNES FASTER THAN AT ANY TIME IN AMERICAN HISTORY
YOU1000000129_S0000056	MEANWHILE WORKERS FELT THAT THEY WERE PROPERTY OF THE RICH AND THAT THEIR SHRINKING VOICE COULD ONLY BE HEARD THROUGH A UNION TO MAKE THINGS EVEN WORSE
YOU1000000129_S0000057	FRICK WHO TOOK HIS ORDERS FROM CARNEGIE DEMANDED INCREASED FACTORY PRODUCTION WHICH WOULD MEAN EVEN MORE HOURS SLAVING AWAY BUT TO TOP IT ALL OFF FRICK WOULD NOT BE INCREASING THEIR INCOME
YOU1000000129_S0000058	HE'D BE REDUCING IT LONGER HOURS AND LESS PAY PUT HOMESTEAD AT A BOILING POINT THE STRIKERS ALSO DEMANDED SAFER WORKING CONDITIONS AND FOR GOOD REASON
YOU1000000129_S0000059	IN EIGHTEEN NINETY EIGHT NINE PERCENT OF ALL STEEL WORKERS INDUSTRYWIDE WOULD DIE ON THE JOB WHEN THE WORKERS REFUSED FRICKS AGGRESSIVE DEMANDS FOR LONGER HOURS AND LESS PAY HE DECIDED TO LOCK OUT ALL EMPLOYEES
YOU1000000129_S0000060	AND BRING IN A SUBSTITUTE GROUP OF IMMIGRANT WORKERS WHO WOULD BE WILLING TO DO THEIR DANGEROUS JOBS FOR LESS
YOU1000000129_S0000061	TO ESCORT THE IMMIGRANT WORKERS AS THEY MADE THEIR WAY TO THE FACTORY FRICK CALLED ON A THREE HUNDRED PERSON ARMY FOR HIRE CALLED THE PINKERTONS ARMED WITH RIFLES
YOU1000000129_S0000062	THEY MADE THEIR WAY TO THE FACTORY WHERE THEY WERE MET BY TEN THOUSAND ANGRY STRIKERS REFUSING TO GIVE UP WHAT THEY CALLED HOME
YOU1000000129_S0000063	HISTORIANS DON'T KNOW WHO FIRED THE FIRST GUNSHOT BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THE DAY WOULD NO LONGER BE CALLED THE HOMESTEAD STRIKE
YOU1000000129_S0000064	BUT RATHER THE HOMESTEAD MASSACRE BY THE END OF THE BATTLE NINE FACTORY WORKERS AND SEVEN PINKERTONS WOULD BE DEAD
YOU1000000129_S0000066	HUNDREDS WOULD BE INJURED THE FIGHTING WAS SO EXTREME THAT THE GOVERNOR ORDERED FOR EIGHT THOUSAND MILITIA TROOPS TO PROVIDE BACKUP UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE STATES TROOPS THE FACTORY WOULD BE REOPENED
YOU1000000129_S0000067	AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR CARNEGIE'S WORKERS THEY WOULD BE RETURNING WITH LOWER PAY LONGER WORKING HOURS AND THE SAME SAFETY CONDITIONS
YOU1000000129_S0000068	ANOTHER COLLATERAL DAMAGE FROM HOMESTEAD CAME IN THE FORM OF CARNEGIE'S REPUTATION PRIOR TO THE TRAGEDIES AT HOMESTEAD HE WOULD OFTEN ADVOCATE IN PUBLIC FOR BETTER CONDITIONS IN STEEL MILLS AND INCREASED WAGES
YOU1000000129_S0000069	BUT THESE WORDS WERE FAR FROM ALIGNED WITH HIS ACTIONS HYPOCRISY WAS INCREDIBLY PREVALENT WHILE HE PREACHED INCREASED WAGES AND IMPROVED SAFETY CONDITIONS
YOU1000000129_S0000070	HE WAS SIMULTANEOUSLY REDUCING LABOUR COSTS BY SLASHING PAYCHECKS AND DOING LITTLE IF ANYTHING TO MAKE HIS FACTORIES A SAFER PLACE TO WORK
YOU1000000129_S0000071	CARNEGIE WAS WIDELY CALLED A COWARD FOR USING FRICK AS HIS SCAPEGOAT NOT ONLY FOR THE TRAGEDY BUT FOR ALL THE OTHER DIRTY WORK THAT HE DIDN'T WANT HIS NAME TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH
YOU1000000129_S0000072	BUT IN SPITE OF THE TENSIONS AND ANIMOSITY THE STEEL MILLS CONTINUE TO THRIVE IN FACT BY NINETEEN HUNDRED THE COMPANY WOULD PRODUCE MORE STEEL THAN THE ENTIRE NATION OF GREAT BRITAIN
YOU1000000129_S0000073	BUT IN NINETEEN OH ONE CARNEGIE GREW TIRED OF THE GAME AND WANTED TO SPEND TIME WITH HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER
YOU1000000129_S0000074	FINANCIER J P MORGAN WAS A RISING COMPETITOR IN THE STEEL INDUSTRY AND CARNAGE NOW NEARING SEVENTY BECAME OPEN TO THE IDEA OF SELLING THE COMPANY HE'D SPENT HIS ENTIRE LIFE BUILDING
YOU1000000129_S0000075	CARNEGIE WROTE ON A SCRAP OF PAPER WHAT HE WOULD BE WILLING TO ACCEPT CHARLES SCHWAB THE PRESIDENT OF CARNEGIE STEEL DELIVERED THE OFFER TO MORGAN
YOU1000000129_S0000076	AS THE STORY GOES JP MORGAN GLANCED AT THE OFFER AND WITHOUT HESITATION ACCEPTED IT MORGAN WOULD BUY CARNEGIE STEEL FOR FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS MAKING CARNEGIE THE SINGLE RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD AT THE TIME
YOU1000000129_S0000077	CARNEGIE WOULD COMPLETELY CUT TIES WITH HIS BUSINESS LIFE AND DEDICATE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF HIMSELF TO SERVING THE WORLD THROUGH PHILANTHROPY NOT A SINGLE DOLLAR WOULD BE LEFT TO HIS FAMILY
YOU1000000129_S0000078	BECAUSE ANDREW HAD ONLY FIVE YEARS OF SCHOOLING HE HAD A SOFT SPOT FOR LIBRARIES WHICH HE CREDITS FOR HELPING HIM ACHIEVE THE FINANCIAL SUCCESS HE ACQUIRED
YOU1000000129_S0000079	OVER THE COURSE OF HIS LIFE HE WOULD DONATE OVER TWO AND A HALF THOUSAND LIBRARIES TO CITIES ALL AROUND THE WORLD BUT IT WASN'T ALL SELF PROMOTION HE WAS GENEROUS FOR GENEROSITY SAKE HIS NAME WAS ONLY DISPLAYED ON LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED OF THOSE LIBRARIES
YOU1000000129_S0000080	ONE EXAMPLE OF HIS GENEROSITY IS CARNEGIE HALL ONE OF NEW YORK'S MOST RECOGNIZABLE LANDMARKS BUILT IN EIGHT NINETY ONE CARNEGIE BUILT AND DONATED THE BUILDING AS THE MUSIC HALL
YOU1000000129_S0000081	BUT ITS ORIGINAL NAME OF THE MUSIC HALL WAS ONLY CHANGED TO THE CURRENT VERSION AFTER HIS DEATH AND NOT BY HIS REQUEST BUT THROUGH THE MUSIC HALLS BOARD MEMBERS AND FROM NINETEEN OH ONE UNTIL HIS DEATH IN NINETEEN NINETEEN IN LENOX MASSACHUSETTS
YOU1000000129_S0000082	CARNEGIE'S FULL TIME JOB WAS GIVING AWAY THE VAST WEALTH HE HAD BUILT UP FOR HIMSELF AS WE MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS STORY CARNEGIE WAS A MAN WHO WAS AS COMPLEX AS HE WAS RICH
YOU1000000129_S0000083	DID HE EMPLOY ABUSIVE LABOR TECHNIQUES TO KEEP HIS FACTORIES PRODUCING MAXIMUM PROFIT YES WAS HE HYPOCRITICAL OF COURSE DID HE MAKE UP SLANDER TO PUT HIS COMPETITORS OUT OF BUSINESS ABSOLUTELY
YOU1000000129_S0000084	WHILE THESE THINGS ARE ALL TRUE CARNEGIE'S PHILANTHROPIC IMPACT IS ALSO EQUALLY GREAT PERPLEXING TO SAY THE LEAST HOW CAN A MAN COMMIT SUCH SINS AND THEN BECOME A SAINT
YOU1000000129_S0000085	PERHAPS HE VIEWED DONATING HIS MONEY AS A WAY TO ATONE FOR HIS BUSINESS SINS MAKING MONEY IS A GREAT FEELING BUT AN EVEN BETTER FEELING IS GIVING IT AWAY IF YOU WANT TO GROW WEALTH AND PERHAPS DONATE TO NOBLE CAUSES LIKE CARNEGIE DID

YOU1000000130_S0000000	HENRY FORD ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL AMERICAN INDUSTRIALISTS THROUGH HIS COMPANY HENRY TRANSFORMED AMERICAN LIFE AND IN THIS VIDEO WE'RE GOING TO LEARN HOW HE DID IT STARTING FROM THE VERY BEGINNING
YOU1000000130_S0000002	THIS VIDEO IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY AUDIBLE AND A BIG PART OF IT IS BASED ON HENRY FORD'S BIOGRAPHY WHICH YOU CAN LISTEN TO FOR FREE ON AUDIBLE IF YOU REGISTER FOR A FREE TRIAL WITH THE LINK IN THE DESCRIPTION
YOU1000000130_S0000003	YOU SHOULD ALSO CHECK OUT REALENGINEERING'S VIDEO ON THE MANUFACTURING INNOVATIONS OF THE ASSEMBLY LINE WHICH HE EXPLAINS MASTERFULLY ON HIS CHANNEL
YOU1000000130_S0000005	BY ALL ACCOUNTS HENRY FORD SHOULD HAVE BEEN A FARMER BORN IN MICHIGAN BARELY TWENTY YEARS AFTER IT HAD BECOME A STATE
YOU1000000130_S0000006	HENRY GREW UP AT A TIME WHEN FARMING WAS SLOW EXHAUSTING AND MANUAL WHICH IS WHY UNSURPRISINGLY HE CAME TO HATE IT WITH A PASSION BUT WHEREAS MOST PEOPLE AT THE TIME DIDN'T HAVE THE FORTUNE TO ESCAPE WHAT THEY WERE BORN INTO
YOU1000000130_S0000007	HENRY WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO GET SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY YOU SEE THE VILLAGE HE WAS BORN INTO WAS JUST EIGHT MILES WEST OF DETROIT WHICH WAS RAPIDLY BECOMING AN INDUSTRIAL CENTER THANKS TO THE STEAM ENGINE
YOU1000000130_S0000008	EARLY ON IN HIS CHILDHOOD HENRY ENCOUNTERED TECHNOLOGY WHICH FEW CHILDREN HIS AGE COULD PLAY AROUND WITH
YOU1000000130_S0000009	HE TINKERED WITH THE WATCHES OF HIS BETTER OFF NEIGHBORS AND BY THE TIME HE WAS TWELVE HE COULD NOT JUST TAKE THEM APART BUT ALSO PUT THEM BACK TOGETHER AND REPAIR THEM
YOU1000000130_S0000010	HIS INTEREST GREW INTO AN OBSESSION WHEN HE GOT TO OBSERVE A WORKING STEAM ENGINE FIRSTHAND WHILE ON A SCHOOL TRIP TO ONE OF THE RAIL COMPANIES IN DETROIT
YOU1000000130_S0000011	BY THE TIME HENRY HAD BECOME A TEENAGER THE STEAM ENGINE WAS ALREADY MAKING ITS WAY INTO THE FARMING COMMUNITY COAL POWERED THRESHING MACHINES AND SAWMILLS WERE BECOMING COMMON SIGHT AND HENRY WAS LEARNING HOW THEY WORKED AND HOW TO FIX THEM
YOU1000000130_S0000012	AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN HE MADE A BIG LEAP FORWARD WHEN AGAINST HIS FATHER'S WISHES HE LEFT HIS VILLAGE TO GO WORK IN DETROIT WHERE ANY YOUNG MECHANIC COULD EASILY FIND VERY LUCRATIVE EMPLOYMENT
YOU1000000130_S0000013	INDUSTRY IN DETROIT WAS BOOMING AND IT HAD BEEN DOING SO FOR CLOSE TO FIVE DECADES IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY FIVE A CANAL HAD BEEN DUG CONNECTING THE HUDSON RIVER TO THE GREAT LAKES WHICH AT THE TIME WERE EFFECTIVELY THE WESTERN FRONTIER
YOU1000000130_S0000014	ALL THE UNTAPPED RESOURCES THAT HAD NO WAY OF GETTING OUT COULD SUDDENLY BE MOVED BY STEAMBOAT TO NEW YORK AND IN THE SPAN OF JUST FIFTY YEARS DETROIT'S POPULATION INCREASED BY A FACTOR OF TEN
YOU1000000130_S0000015	WITH VAST MINES IN THE NORTH PRODUCING COPPER AND IRON AND LUMBER MILLS OPENING UP VIRTUALLY EVERYWHERE
YOU1000000130_S0000016	ALL THIS METAL AND WOOD SUSTAINED CLOSE TO A THOUSAND COMPANIES IN DETROIT ALONE INCLUDING THE ONES IN WHICH HENRY WOULD WORK AT OVER THE COURSE OF THE EIGHTEEN EIGHTY S
YOU1000000130_S0000017	IT IS DURING THIS TIME THAT HENRY BY CHANCE LEARNED ABOUT THE GAS ENGINE FROM A BRITISH MAGAZINE IT WAS BEING PRODUCED IN SMALL NUMBERS BY A GERMAN ENGINEER NICHOLAS OTTO
YOU1000000130_S0000018	AND IT WAS GAINING SOME TRACTION IN EUROPE BUT IT WAS PRACTICALLY UNHEARD OF IN AMERICA HENRY WOULD GET THE CHANCE TO WORK ON SUCH AN ENGINE HIMSELF IN EIGHT EIGHTY NINE AND HE INSTANTLY RECOGNIZED THE ADVANTAGES IT HAD
YOU1000000130_S0000019	BECAUSE IT DID NOT USE STEAM THE ENGINE WAS MUCH LIGHTER AND GOT RID OF THE HEAVY BOILER AND ALL THE WATER IN IT BECAUSE IT DID ALL THE COMBUSTION INTERNALLY A MUCH MORE EFFICIENT PROCESS
YOU1000000130_S0000020	THIS ALSO ALLOWED THE GAS ENGINE TO START QUICKLY WHEREAS STEAM ENGINES OF THE TIME NEEDED AS MUCH AS THIRTY MINUTES TO HEAT UP THE WATER AND GENERATE ENOUGH STEAM TO START WORKING THE GAS ENGINE WAS AN INNOVATION HENRY FELL IN LOVE WITH
YOU1000000130_S0000021	BUT IT WAS ALSO ONE HE DIDN'T FULLY UNDERSTAND AFTER ALL HE HAD EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE WITH STEAM AND METAL BUT ALMOST NONE WITH ELECTRICITY AND THE GAS ENGINE WAS FIRED BY AN ELECTRIC SPARK
YOU1000000130_S0000022	TO OBTAIN THIS MISSING KNOWLEDGE HENRY WENT TO WORK FOR THE LOCAL BRANCH OF THE EDISON ILLUMINATING COMPANY
YOU1000000130_S0000023	IT WAS GENERATING ELECTRICITY FOR OVER A THOUSAND HOMES IN DETROIT AND IT WAS DOING SO BY USING STEAM ENGINES SO HENRY WAS A NATURAL HIRE FOR THEM WHENEVER THE ENGINES BROKE HENRY HAD TO FIX THEM BUT WHENEVER THEY WERE WORKING
YOU1000000130_S0000024	HE WAS FREE TO DO AS HE WISHED IT WAS THE PERFECT JOB THAT ALLOWED HIM TO SPEND HIS DAYS EXPERIMENTING WITH GAS ENGINES IN EIGHTEEN NINETY THREE WHEN HENRY HAD ALREADY BEEN PROMOTED TO CHIEF ENGINEER AT EDISON
YOU1000000130_S0000025	HE CREATED HIS FIRST WORKING GAS ENGINE THE IDEA OF USING THE GAS ENGINE TO CREATE A HORSELESS CARRIAGE HAD BEEN AROUND IN HENRY'S MIND SINCE HE FIRST LAID EYES ON ONE BUT ACTUALLY MAKING THAT IDEA A REALITY WOULD TAKE YEARS OF WORK
YOU1000000130_S0000026	BUILDING A CAR IN A WORLD WITH NO CAR PARTS WASN'T EASY AND HENRY HAD TO FIGURE OUT EVERY DETAIL THROUGH TRIAL AND ERROR IT TOOK HIM THREE YEARS OF CONSTANT EFFORT TO PRODUCE THIS THE QUADRO CYCLE
YOU1000000130_S0000027	A SIMPLE FRAME WITH AN ENGINE POWERED BY ETHANOL AND FOUR BICYCLE WHEELS MOUNTED ONTO IT IT HAD ONLY TWO GEARS AND NEITHER ONE WAS FOR GOING IN REVERSE BUT WHAT'S WORSE IS THAT IT HAD NO COOLING SYSTEM TO SPEAK OF
YOU1000000130_S0000028	THUS MAKING OVERHEATING A CONSTANT ISSUE IN ITS FIRST YEAR HENRY MADE NUMEROUS IMPROVEMENTS TO THE QUADRO CYCLE MOST NOTABLY ADDING A COOLING SYSTEM AND BY THE TIME HE SOLD IT IN EIGHTEEN NINETY SEVEN FOR TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS
YOU1000000130_S0000029	HE HAD DRIVEN A THOUSAND MILES HENRY BUILT A SECOND QUADRI CYCLE AND THEN A THIRD ONE ALWAYS IMPROVING THE DESIGN BEFORE FINALLY FEELING CONFIDENT ENOUGH IN EIGHT NINETY NINE TO START HIS OWN COMPANY
YOU1000000130_S0000031	CAPITALIZED AT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THE DETROIT AUTOMOBILE COMPANY WAS A VERY AMBITIOUS VENTURE MANY OF THE DETROIT ELITE INVESTED IN IT INCLUDING HENRY'S FRIENDS FROM THE EDISON COMPANY
YOU1000000130_S0000032	AND EVERYONE WAS EAGER TO SEE WHAT HENRY COULD CREATE WITH PROPER CAPITAL HENRY'S PLAN WAS VERY CLEVER SINCE HE PERSONALLY KNEW MANY OF THE INDUSTRIALISTS IN DETROIT BY THAT POINT HE'D TRY TO BUILD AN AUTOMOBILE THEY COULD USE IN THEIR BUSINESSES
YOU1000000130_S0000033	HE LEASED A FACTORY AND PLANNED TO HIRE A HUNDRED WORKERS TO MAKE HIS NEW DELIVERY WAGON AS HE CALLED IT BUT IT TURNED OUT THAT BUILDING SUCH COMPLEX MACHINES IN HIGH NUMBERS WAS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT THAN HENRY IMAGINED
YOU1000000130_S0000034	THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE PARTS USED IN THE MAKING OF THE DELIVERY WAGON WERE PRODUCED BY OTHER COMPANIES AND EVERY TIME A SINGLE DELIVERY WAS LATE THE ENTIRE FACTORY WOULD HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO STOP WORKING
YOU1000000130_S0000035	THE FIRST DELIVERY WAGON TOOK SIX MONTHS TO PRODUCE AND NO MORE THAN TWENTY WERE MADE IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THE COMPANY'S EXISTENCE BY THE END OF NINETEEN O TWO THE OTHER SHAREHOLDERS WERE SICK OF HENRY'S LACK OF PROGRESS
YOU1000000130_S0000036	AND ACTUALLY VOTED TO GET RID OF HIM NOW BECAUSE HENRY HELD ONLY FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THE COMPANY HE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO COMPLY
YOU1000000130_S0000037	AND INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH THE MAN WHO TOOK OVER THE DETROIT AUTOMOBILE COMPANY WOULD EVENTUALLY TRANSFORM IT INTO CATALOG BUT THAT'S A STORY FOR A DIFFERENT TIME WHAT MATTERS IS THAT HENRY WAS PUSHED OUT OF HIS OWN COMPANY
YOU1000000130_S0000038	AND HAD ONLY A THOUSAND DOLLARS TO HIS NAME IT WAS BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD AND THIS TIME HENRY WOULD TAKE A VERY DIFFERENT APPROACH INSTEAD OF TARGETING BUSINESSES WITH EXPENSIVE MACHINES HENRY WOULD DESIGN A VEHICLE TO BE USED BY THE AVERAGE MAN
YOU1000000130_S0000039	YOU SEE AT THE TIME VIRTUALLY ALL CARS WERE HIGH TICKET ITEMS THEY WERE MOSTLY MADE BY SKILLED CRAFTSMEN ONE AT A TIME AND MORE OFTEN THAN NOT WERE DESIGNED FOR RACING WHICH WAS RAPIDLY BECOMING A FAVOURITE AMERICAN ACTIVITY
YOU1000000130_S0000040	HENRY ENVISIONED TURNING THE CAR FROM A STATUS SYMBOL INTO A COMMODITY BUT DOING THAT WOULD NOT BE EASY AND IN FACT IT TOOK HENRY TWENTY DIFFERENT DESIGN ITERATIONS BEFORE HE FINALLY GOT ONE THAT WORKED
YOU1000000130_S0000041	HENRY LABELED HIS FIRST DESIGN AS THE MODEL AND WORKED HIS WAY THROUGH THE ALPHABET OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS SUSTAINED BY CAPITAL FROM HIS FRIENDS AND FAMILY
YOU1000000130_S0000042	BUT WHAT CHANGED THE MOST DURING THIS TIME IS NOT THE CAR ITSELF BUT THE PRODUCTION PROCESS HENRY LEARNED THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING A RELIABLE SUPPLY CHAIN WHEN HIS FIRST COMPANY FAILED WHICH IS WHY THIS TIME AROUND
YOU1000000130_S0000043	HE TRIED GETTING AS MANY PARTS AS POSSIBLE FROM THE SAME MANUFACTURER THE ONE HE CHOSE WILL PROBABLY SOUND FAMILIAR THE DOG BROTHERS COMPANY A MACHINE SHOP IN DETROIT THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY EVOLVE INTO THE AUTONOMOUS AMERICAN BRAND
YOU1000000130_S0000044	THE BIGGEST GAME CHANGER OF ALL HOWEVER WAS HENRY'S CHANCE VISIT TO A SLAUGHTERHOUSE IN CHICAGO HE SAW THERE SOMETHING INTERESTING A DISASSEMBLY LINE SO TO SPEAK WHERE MULTIPLE WORKERS WOULD PROCESS CARCASSES MOVING DOWN THE LINE
YOU1000000130_S0000045	HENRY FIGURED HE COULD USE THE SAME PROCESS BUT IN REVERSE AN ASSEMBLY LINE USING THE MONEY HE HAD SAVED FROM SOME OF HIS EARLIER MODELS WHICH WERE ALSO ASSEMBLED BY THE DUTCH BROTHERS
YOU1000000130_S0000046	HENRY WAS ABLE TO BUILD A FACTORY OF HIS OWN IN NINETEEN OH FOUR WHERE HE COULD EXPERIMENT WITH THE ASSEMBLY LINE PROCESS BY NINETEEN O'FIVE THE FORD FACTORY EMPLOYED OVER THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE THAT BUILT TWENTY FIVE CARS A DAY
YOU1000000130_S0000047	BUT HENRY STILL HADN'T FIGURED EVERYTHING OUT HE WAS PRODUCING MULTIPLE DIFFERENT MODELS AT THE SAME TIME WHICH PREVENTED HIM FROM PROPERLY USING AN ASSEMBLY LINE
YOU1000000130_S0000048	NEVERTHELESS THERE WAS A SIGN OF THINGS TO COME THE AFFORDABLE MOON CREATED IN NINETEEN OH SIX BECAME THE BEST SELLING CAR IN THE US AND FORD BECAME THE BIGGEST CAR PRODUCER IN AMERICA
YOU1000000130_S0000049	IT IS ACTUALLY DURING THE PRODUCTION OF THIS MODEL THAT HENRY WOULD FIRST USE THE ASSEMBLY LINE PROCESS TO AT LEAST PARTIALLY ASSEMBLE SOME OF HIS CARS
YOU1000000130_S0000050	IT WASN'T A FULL MOVING ASSEMBLY LINE BUT NEVERTHELESS THIS EXPERIMENT INCREASED PRODUCTION BY A FACTOR OF FIVE IN THE SAME FACTORY LOGISTICS OF COURSE WAS ANOTHER BIG PART OF HENRY'S SUCCESS
YOU1000000130_S0000051	IN NINETEEN OH FIVE HE CREATED THE FORD MANUFACTURING COMPANY COMPLETE WITH ITS OWN FACTORY TO START MAKING THE ENGINES AND TRANSMISSIONS OF HENRY'S CARS TO FURTHER ELIMINATE ANY POSSIBILITY OF DELAYS
YOU1000000130_S0000052	BUT THE BIGGEST FACTOR IN HENRY'S SUCCESS CAME FROM PERHAPS THE MOST UNEXPECTED PLACE PERU NOW THIS IS A STORY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HEAR ANYWHERE ELSE SO LISTEN CAREFULLY
YOU1000000130_S0000053	IN NINETEEN OH SEVEN HENRY BEGAN CONSTRUCTION OF A HEAT TREATMENT PLANT TO PRODUCE CANADIAN STEEL
YOU1000000130_S0000054	THIS ALLOY WAS NEW TO AMERICA IN FACT FEW FURNACES IN THE U S COULD EVEN REACH THE TEMPERATURE NEEDED TO MANUFACTURE IT THE DIFFICULTY IN PRODUCING IT HOWEVER WAS WORTH IT
YOU1000000130_S0000055	BECAUSE VANADIUM STEEL WAS MORE THAN TWICE AS STRONG AS REGULAR STEEL WHILE ACTUALLY BEING LIGHTER NOW AT THE TIME VANADIUM METALLURGY WAS CUTTING EDGE RESEARCH
YOU1000000130_S0000056	BUT HENRY HAD AN EXTREMELY LUCKY CONNECTION HE WAS FRIENDS WITH THE TWO BROTHERS WHO OWNED THE ONE CANADIAN MINE IN PERU PRODUCING NINETY TWO PERCENT OF THE WORLD'S SUPPLY
YOU1000000130_S0000057	JOSEPH AND JAMES FLANNERY HAD COMMERCIALIZED VANADIUM STEEL IN EUROPE AND IN THE US BY SELLING IT TO RAIL COMPANIES BUT THEIR PERUVIAN MINE WAS PRODUCING SO MUCH VANADIUM THAT THEY HAD TO DO SOMETHING ELSE WITH IT
YOU1000000130_S0000059	THEY SOLD VANADIUM STEEL TO THE U S GOVERNMENT FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PANAMA CANAL BUT EVEN THAT WASN'T ENOUGH SO WHEN THEY MET HENRY IN NINETEEN SIX THEY IMMEDIATELY MADE HIM AN OFFER
YOU1000000130_S0000060	THEY WOULD HELP HIM TRANSITION HIS ENTIRE MANUFACTURING PROCESS TO USE CANADIAN STEEL IT WAS THEIR CHIEF ENGINEER THAT BUILT THE HEAT TREATMENT PLANT FOR HENRY IN NINETY SEVEN
YOU1000000130_S0000061	AND IT WAS THEIR COMPANY THAT SUPPLIED FORD WITH ALL THE VANADIUM IT NEEDED FOR ITS CARS THE FIRST FORD CAR DESIGNED WITH CANADIAN STEEL WAS THE MARET IN NINETEEN EIGHT AND IT WAS THIS ALLOY THAT ACTUALLY MADE IT SUCCESSFUL
YOU1000000130_S0000062	IT WASN'T THE CHEAPEST CAR HENRY HAD MADE THE MODEL AND ITS UPSCALE VERSIONS WERE ACTUALLY CHEAPER BUT IT DIDN'T NEED TO BE BECAUSE IT WAS BY FAR THE BEST CAR BUILT AT THE TIME MUCH STRONGER THAN ANY COMPETITOR
YOU1000000130_S0000063	THE SHEER DIFFERENCE IN QUALITY WAS THE ONLY MARKETING HENRY NEEDED AND WITHIN WEEKS OF THE MODEL TS RELEASE FORD RECEIVED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND ORDERS FOR IT
YOU1000000130_S0000064	EVEN THOUGH IT MANAGED TO PRODUCE ONLY SEVENTEEN THOUSAND UNITS FOR THE ENTIRETY OF NINETEEN NINE HENRY REALIZED JUST HOW BIG OF A DEAL THE MODEL T WAS WHICH IS WHY HE BUILT A SECOND FACTORY IN NINETEEN TEN
YOU1000000130_S0000065	AND IT IS THERE THAT HE WOULD PERFECT THE MOVING ASSEMBLY LINE IN NINETEEN THIRTEEN DURING THIS PERIOD PRODUCTION WOULD DOUBLE EVERY YEAR IN NINETEEN TEN HE BUILT TWENTY THOUSAND MODEL TS
YOU1000000130_S0000066	AND JUST SIX YEARS LATER HE WAS BUILDING OVER HALF A MILLION AT THE SAME TIME HENRY ADOPTED ANOTHER BRILLIANT STRATEGY HE WAS CONSTANTLY REDUCING THE PRICE OF HIS CARS TO FURTHER INCREASE HIS MARKET SHARE
YOU1000000130_S0000067	IN FACT DURING THESE SIX YEARS HE CUT THE MODEL TS PRICE BY MORE THAN HALF BY NINETEEN EIGHTEEN HALF OF ALL CARS IN AMERICA WERE MODELS AND THIS TREND WOULD CONTINUE WELL INTO THE NINETEEN TWENTY S
YOU1000000130_S0000068	HENRY HAD BEGUN A NEW AGE IN AMERICAN HISTORY THE AGE OF THE AUTOMOBILE AND IT WAS HIS COMPANY THAT WOULD TOTALLY DOMINATE IT IN ITS FIRST TWO DECADES
YOU1000000130_S0000069	IT WASN'T UNTIL THE END OF THE NINETEEN TWENTY S THAT THE REST OF THE AUTO INDUSTRY CAUGHT UP TO HENRY BUT AT THAT POINT HE WAS ALREADY ONE OF THE RICHEST MEN ALIVE
YOU1000000130_S0000070	IN NINETEEN TWENTY TWO HE ACTUALLY TOOK THE TIME TO WRITE AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY WHERE PARTS OF THIS VIDEO CAME FROM AND WHICH YOU CAN LISTEN TO FOR FREE AS PART OF YOUR THIRTY DAY FREE TRIAL OF AUDIBLE

YOU1000000131_S0000000	WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WEALTHIEST MAN ALIVE TODAY TOPPING THE CHARTS ARE TECH BILLIONAIRES LIKE JEFF BEZOS AND BILL GATES BUT ACTUALLY THE WEALTHIEST BUSINESSMAN TO HAVE EVER LIVED DIED ALMOST A CENTURY AGO
YOU1000000131_S0000001	IN TODAY'S VIDEO WE'LL BE LOOKING AT A BUSINESS EMPIRE SO VAST THAT EVEN AFTER A HUNDRED YEARS OF TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS NO MAN HAS MANAGED TO OVERTAKE ITS FOUNDER THIS IS THE HISTORY OF STANDARD OIL
YOU1000000131_S0000003	THIS VIDEO IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY DOLLAR SHAVE CLUB VISIT THE LINK IN THE DESCRIPTION TO LEARN ABOUT THE AWESOME DEAL THEY'RE OFFERING
YOU1000000131_S0000005	THE ORIGINS OF HISTORY'S GREATEST OIL MONOPOLY ARE ACTUALLY PRETTY HUMBLE IT ALL STARTS IN EIGHT THIRTY NINE WITH THE BIRTH OF JOHN ROCKEFELLER IN UPSTATE NEW YORK HE WAS THE ELDEST SON OF A TRAVELLING MERCHANT
YOU1000000131_S0000006	WHO IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS A BOTANIC PHYSICIAN BUT IN REALITY WAS SELLING THE NINETEENTH CENTURY EQUIVALENT OF HOMEOPATHIC MEDICINE
YOU1000000131_S0000007	HE WOULD SPEND WEEKS AWAY FROM HOME AND IN FACT WOULD HAVE SEVERAL CHILDREN WITH ANOTHER WOMAN WHO HE DECIDED TO BRING BACK HOME TO HIS WIFE
YOU1000000131_S0000008	SO THEY COULD ALL LIVE TOGETHER IN THIS VERY CONFUSING HOUSEHOLD JOHN WOULD GROW UP LEARNING HOW TO HUSTLE PEOPLE FOR THE BEST DEAL POSSIBLE AND HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF EVERY PENNY HE GOT HIS FAMILY WOULD RARELY STAY IN ONE PLACE FOR LONG
YOU1000000131_S0000009	AND JOHN WOULD LIVE THIS NOMADIC LIFESTYLE EVER SINCE HE WAS THREE YEARS OLD TO HELP HIS MOTHER JOHN WOULD EARN ANY MONEY HE COULD BY RAISING TURKEYS OR DOING WORK FOR NEIGHBORS HIS INTELLIGENCE WAS PUT TO GOOD USE
YOU1000000131_S0000010	WHEN THE FAMILY MOVED TO CLEVELAND OHIO IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY FOUR WHERE HE GOT THE CHANCE TO ATTEND A PROPER SCHOOL BUT LESS THAN A YEAR LATER JOHN DROPPED OUT IN ORDER TO WORK AS A BOOKKEEPER THE LOCAL PRODUCE BROKER HE WOULD EARN FIFTY CENTS PER DAY
YOU1000000131_S0000011	WHICH OBVIOUSLY WASN'T MUCH AT THE TIME SO HE WOULD HELP OTHER COMPANIES ON THE SIDE BUT AFTER TWO YEARS OF WORKING THERE HIS BOSSES REFUSED TO GIVE HIM A MEANINGFUL RAISE SO HE DECIDED TO ONE UP THEM BY STARTING HIS OWN PRODUCE BROKERAGE
YOU1000000131_S0000012	THANKS TO HIS GOOD REPUTATION HE GOT A LOAN OF FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH AT THE TIME WAS A HUGE SUM JOHN STARTED TRADING HAY GRAIN AND VARIOUS MEATS AND IN HIS FIRST YEAR HE RECORDED SALES OF HALF A MILLION DOLLARS
YOU1000000131_S0000013	OF WHICH HE ONLY GOT A SMALL FRACTION HIS COMMISSIONS BUT STILL IT WAS A HUGE SUCCESS EVERY BANK IN CLEVELAND WAS BEGGING JOHN TO BORROW MONEY AND HE WAS BARELY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD BUT THEN IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE
YOU1000000131_S0000014	SOMETHING HAPPENED THAT WOULD CHANGE HIS LIFE FOREVER JUST A HUNDRED MILES EAST OF CLEVELAND THE FIRST AMERICAN OILWELL HAD BEEN DISCOVERED THIS MARKED THE BEGINNING OF THE PENNSYLVANIA OIL RUSH AND WITHIN A YEAR
YOU1000000131_S0000015	FOUR AND A HALF THOUSAND BARRELS OF OIL WOULD BE PRODUCED NOW BACK THEN OIL WASN'T QUITE AS VALUABLE AS IT IS TODAY GASOLINE CARS HADN'T BEEN INVENTED YET BUT OIL COULD STILL BE PROCESSED INTO KEROSENE WHICH PEOPLE WOULD THEN USE IN LAMPS
YOU1000000131_S0000016	JOHN REALIZED HOWEVER THAT THE BIGGEST PROFITS TO BE HAD WEREN'T IN DRILLING FOR OIL BUT IN REFINING IT HE WITNESSED MANY PEOPLE GOING BUZZ BEFORE STRIKING OIL SO HE KNEW THAT THE BUSINESS WAS TOO RISKY FOR HIM
YOU1000000131_S0000017	INSTEAD HE'D LET OTHERS GO THROUGH THE HASSLE OF FINDING THE OIL AND HE WOULD JUST BUY IT OFF OF THEM JOHN HAD TO WAIT UNTIL SIXTY THREE FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO BUILD A RAIL LINE CONNECTING THE PENNSYLVANIA OIL FIELDS TO CLEVELAND
YOU1000000131_S0000018	BUT WHEN THAT LINE WAS BUILT JOHN WAS READY FOR IT WITH A LONG LINE OF PARTNERS AND BANKS READY TO BACK HIM UP HE ALSO ASSEMBLED A TEAM OF SEASONED CHEMISTS AND ENGINEERS WHO NOT ONLY OPTIMIZED THE REFINING PROCESS BUT ALSO DISCOVERED VARIOUS USES
YOU1000000131_S0000019	FOR THE BYPRODUCTS OF REFINING PETROLEUM YOU SEE THE EARLY REFINERIES IN CLEVELAND COULD ONLY OPERATE AT ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT EFFICIENCY BUT JOHN NOT ONLY INCREASED THAT PERCENTAGE HE ALSO STARTED SELLING ALL THE BYPRODUCTS LIKE PARAFFIN WAX
YOU1000000131_S0000020	AND NAFTA WITHIN TWO YEARS THE ROCKEFELLER REFINERY WAS WORTH OVER SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND WAS AMONG THE LARGEST IN CLEVELAND BUT JOHN WASN'T DONE
YOU1000000131_S0000021	IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE THERE WERE TWENTY SIX COMPETING REFINERIES BUT WITHIN FIVE YEARS JOHN HAD ACQUIRED ALL BUT FOUR
YOU1000000131_S0000023	BY THIS POINT HIS BUSINESS WAS GETTING TOO BIG TO HANDLE AS A PARTNERSHIP SO IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY HE INCORPORATED STANDARD OIL OF OHIO TO CONVINCE THE FEW REMAINING COMPETITORS IN CLEVELAND JOHN WOULD SIMPLY INVITE THEM OVER AND SHOW THEM HIS BOOKS
YOU1000000131_S0000024	REVEALING THAT HE COULD OPERATE AT A LOSS FAR LONGER THAN THEY COULD STAY SOLVENT IN EXCHANGE FOR A GOOD BUYOUT PRICE JOHN WOULD OFFER HIS COMPETITORS POSITIONS IN HIS OWN COMPANY THUS PLACING THE BRIGHTEST MINDS IN THE INDUSTRY UNDER HIS CONTROL
YOU1000000131_S0000025	OF COURSE NOT EVERYONE WOULD GIVE UP IMMEDIATELY AND OVER TIME JOHN ERODED THE PRICE OF OIL AND CARADINE SOMETIMES BY AS MUCH AS EIGHTY PERCENT IN ORDER TO STRANGLE COMPETITORS UNSURPRISINGLY HIS STRATEGY WORKED
YOU1000000131_S0000026	BY EIGHTEEN EIGHTY HE HAD ACQUIRED REFINERIES ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN US AND WAS REFINING OVER NINETY PERCENT OF THE ENTIRE COUNTRY'S OIL PRODUCTION AT THIS POINT JOHN WAS SO POWERFUL THAT HE COULD INVITE THE OWNERS OF THE BIG RAIL COMPANIES
YOU1000000131_S0000027	AND PERSONALLY NEGOTIATE REBATES FOR USING THEIR TRAINS BUT THIS PRACTICE OF NEGOTIATING BACKROOM DEALS REALLY GOT THE BUSINESS WORLD RILED UP AT THE TIME AND STILL KIND OF TODAY MOST INDUSTRIAL GOODS WERE TRANSPORTED BY RAIL
YOU1000000131_S0000028	AND MANY BIG INDUSTRIALISTS GOT WORRIED
YOU1000000131_S0000030	THE JOHN'S ABUSE OF TRANSPORTATION REBATES COULD RESULT IN SIMILAR MONOPOLIZATION IN THEIR INDUSTRIES
YOU1000000131_S0000031	OVER THE NEXT DECADE BUSINESSMEN POLITICIANS AND THE MEDIA WOULD ATTACK STANDARD OIL WITH INCREASING FEROCITY LEGISLATORS IN OHIO BEGAN DRAFTING ANTITRUST REGULATIONS TO BRING DOWN ROCKEFELLER BUT HE WAS ONE STEP AHEAD
YOU1000000131_S0000032	IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO HE RE INCORPORATED IN NEW JERSEY THIS TIME CREATING THE STANDARD OIL TRUST WHICH IN TURN HELD STAKES IN OVER FORTY LOCAL COMPANIES
YOU1000000131_S0000033	THEN TO SHOWCASE HIS SUCCESS JOHN BUILT AN IMPRESSIVE HEADQUARTERS FOR HIS COMPANY ON BROADWAY THIS MOMENT WAS THE HIGH POINT OF ROCKEFELLER'S STANDARD OIL
YOU1000000131_S0000034	HE OWNED TWENTY THOUSAND OIL WELLS FOUR THOUSAND MILES OF PIPELINE AND EMPLOYED OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE BUT HIS GRIP ON THE OIL INDUSTRY WAS LOOSENING BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND ABROAD
YOU1000000131_S0000035	MASSIVE OIL DEPOSITS HAD BEEN DISCOVERED IN RUSSIA AND IN ASIA AND WERE BEING DEVELOPED BY THE ROTHSCHILD FAMILY WHICH SPARED NO EFFORT IN GETTING THAT OIL TO AMERICA
YOU1000000131_S0000036	WORSE YET IN EIGHT NINETY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PASSED THE SHERMAN ANTITRUST ACT WHICH OFFICIALLY GAVE POLITICIANS THE TEETH TO GO AFTER THE STANDARD OIL TRUST ITSELF
YOU1000000131_S0000037	OF COURSE THE COMPLEX LEGAL STRUCTURE BEHIND ALL THE COMPANIES WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO INVESTIGATE WHICH IS WHY THE GOVERNMENT COULDN'T ACTUALLY BREAK UP STANDARD OIL UNTIL NINETEEN ELEVEN
YOU1000000131_S0000038	BY THAT POINT HOWEVER JOHN ROCKEFELLER HAD ALREADY CASHED IN AND WAS NO LONGER ACTIVELY MANAGING THE COMPANY IN THE FINAL TWENTY YEARS OF HIS COMPANY'S EXISTENCE IT HAD PAID OUT OVER HALF A BILLION DOLLARS IN DIVIDENDS
YOU1000000131_S0000039	BY SOME ESTIMATES THE TRUE WORTH OF STANDARD OIL AT ITS PEAK WAS ONE TRILLION DOLLARS SO THE BREAKUP DIDN'T REALLY COME AS A SURPRISE TO MOST PEOPLE IN NINETEEN ELEVEN THE SUPREME COURT FOUND STANDARD OIL GUILTY OF ANTI COMPETITIVE PRACTICES
YOU1000000131_S0000040	BROKE THE COMPANY UP INTO THIRTY FOUR SEPARATE ENTITIES OF COURSE JOHN ROCKEFELLER KEPT HIS STAKE IN THOSE COMPANIES UNTIL HIS DEATH AND IN FACT IT TURNS OUT THAT THE BREAKUP WAS THE MOST PROFITABLE EVENT IN HIS LIFE
YOU1000000131_S0000041	YOU SEE OVER TIME MANY OF THOSE COMPANIES MERGED BACK WITH ONE ANOTHER TODAY MOST OF THE STANDARD REMNANTS ARE PART OF EITHER EXXONMOBIL CHEVRON OR BP WHICH HAVE SINCE BECOME INCREDIBLY LARGE COMPANIES IN THEIR OWN RIGHT
YOU1000000131_S0000042	JOHN ROCKEFELLER'S OWNERSHIP OF THESE SUCCESSOR COMPANIES MADE HIM THE RICHEST BUSINESSMAN TO HAVE EVER LIVED WITH AN ESTIMATED NET WORTH OF FOUR HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS EVEN TODAY NO ONE HAS BEATEN ROCKEFELLER AND THE LEADERBOARD
YOU1000000131_S0000043	NOT EVEN JEFF BEZOS HIMSELF SEEMS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE THAT BUT THERE'S ONE THING THAT JEFF BEZOS DOES HAVE THAT JOHN ROCKEFELLER NEVER DID DESPITE ALL HIS MONEY AND THAT IS ACCESS TO DOLLAR SHAVE CLUB
YOU1000000131_S0000044	I MEAN LOOK AT HIM IT'S CLEAR THAT THIS MAN CARES VERY MUCH ABOUT LOOKING AND FEELING AT HIS VERY BEST BUT GUESS WHAT YOU TOO CAN EXPERIENCE THE SPLENDOR OF DOLLAR SHAVE CLUB DAILY ESSENTIAL STARTER SET

YOU1000000132_S0000001	THE VAST AND SHROUDED WEALTH OF THE ROTHSCHILDS HAS ENDURED FOR GENERATIONS AND HAS UNSURPRISINGLY MADE IT HARD TO TELL WHAT IS FACT AND WHAT IS FICTION
YOU1000000132_S0000002	IN THIS VIDEO WE'RE GOING BACK TO THE EARLIEST DAYS OF THIS FAMOUS JEWISH FAMILY TO SEE HOW THEY MANAGED TO BUILD ONE OF THE GREATEST FORTUNES IN HISTORY AT A TIME OF RAMPANT ANTISEMITISM
YOU1000000132_S0000003	THIS VIDEO IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY SKILLSHARE WITH WHOM I'VE PARTNERED TO MAKE A SERIES OF EDUCATIONAL VIDEOS ON THE STOCK MARKET WHICH YOU CAN WATCH FOR FREE BY USING THE LINK IN THE DESCRIPTION OUR STORY BEGINS IN MEDIEVAL EUROPE
YOU1000000132_S0000004	BY THE TENTH CENTURY MOST OF EUROPE WAS UNDER THE DOMAIN OF CHRISTIANITY POLITICAL POWER WAS INVARIABLY TIED TO RELIGION WHICH MADE BEING A NON CHRISTIAN VERY UNFAVORABLE PERHAPS THE BIGGEST VICTIMS OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE THE JEWS
YOU1000000132_S0000005	HAVING NO HOME STATE OF THEIR OWN TO FALL BACK TO THE JEWS WERE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT EUROPE AND MANY OF THEM SETTLED IN THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE
YOU1000000132_S0000006	THIS VAST MULTI ETHNIC STATE CONTAINED MODERN DAY GERMANY AND LIKE THE REST OF EUROPE IT TOO WASN'T HAPPY TO HARBOR THE JEWS
YOU1000000132_S0000007	IN MANY CITIES THE JEWS WERE FORCED TO LIVE IN PARTICULAR NEIGHBORHOODS IN WHAT WE NOW CALL GHETTOS AND THE CITY OF FRANKFORT WAS NO EXCEPTION
YOU1000000132_S0000008	FROM FOURTEEN SIXTY TWO ONWARDS IT CONFINED ALL THE JEWS IN THE CITY TO A SINGLE NARROW STREET OUTSIDE THE CITY WALLS THAT STREET CAME TO BE KNOWN AS THE UDINGA OR THE JEWISH ALLEY AND IT WAS MADE UP OF NUMEROUS TIGHTLY PACKED HOUSES
YOU1000000132_S0000009	BACK THEN THE BUILDINGS WEREN'T DISTINGUISHED BY NUMBERS BUT BY SIGNS ONE BUILDING COULD BE THE HOUSE OF THE SHIP FOR EXAMPLE WHILE ANOTHER COULD BE THE HOUSE OF THE GOLDEN STONE THE SIGN ON ONE OF THOSE HOUSES WAS A RED SHIELD
YOU1000000132_S0000010	OR ROTHSCHILD IN GERMAN AND THE FAMILY LIVING IN THE HOUSE HAD GONE BY THE SAME NAME SINCE AT LEAST FIFTEEN TWENTY EIGHT LIKE MOST JEWISH FAMILIES AT THE TIME THE ROTHSCHILDS WERE INVOLVED IN FINANCE
YOU1000000132_S0000011	YOU SEE IN MEDIEVAL EUROPE CHRISTIANITY FORBADE ANYONE FROM LENDING MONEY WITH INTEREST LEAVING THIS OTHERWISE PROFITABLE BUSINESS INTO THE HANDS OF THE JEWS EXPERIENCE WITH MONEY LENDING AND BY EXTENSION ANYTHING RELATING TO FINANCE WAS PASSED DOWN GENERATIONS
YOU1000000132_S0000012	AND ROTHSCHILDS WERE NO EXCEPTION THEY SPECIALIZED IN EXCHANGING CURRENCIES AND TRADING COLLECTABLE COINS AND THE BEST ONE OF THEM ALL WAS MAYER ROTHSCHILD HE TOOK UP THE FAMILY BUSINESS IN SEVENTEEN SIXTY THREE AND HIS EXTENSIVE COLLECTION OF COINS
YOU1000000132_S0000013	ATTRACTED THE WEALTHIEST ARISTOCRATS IN THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE AMONG THEM WAS CROWNED PRINCE WILHELM OF HES THE PRINCE MET MAYOR IN SEVENTEEN SIXTY NINE AND QUICKLY LEARNED TO TRUST HIM WITH ALL MATTERS RELATING NOT JUST TO COLLECTABLE COINS
YOU1000000132_S0000014	BUT ANYTHING FINANCIAL WHEN WILLHELM CAME INTO POWER AS WILLHELM THE NINTH OF HERS IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FIVE HE HIRED MEYER TO MANAGE HIS FINANCES AS HIS HOUDE OR COURT JEW NOW KEEP IN MIND THIS WAS A COMMON ARRANGEMENT IN CENTRAL EUROPE
YOU1000000132_S0000015	THE NOBILITY WOULD OUTSOURCE THEIR FINANCES TO JEWS IN EXCHANGE FOR PROTECTION MONEY AND SOMETIMES EVEN ACTUAL NOBLE TITLES MEYER OVERSAW THE TAXES COLLECTED IN WILHELM'S LAND AND HAD TO KEEP HIS MONEY SAFE
YOU1000000132_S0000016	A TASK THAT BECAME VERY DIFFICULT IN EIGHTEEN SIX THAT IS THE YEAR WHEN NAPOLEON INVADED HIS DRIVING WILLHELM INTO EXILE AND PUTTING HIS FORTUNE AT RISK BUT MEYER WAS SMART AND HE WAS READY FOR NAPOLEON
YOU1000000132_S0000017	IN SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT HE HAD SENT ONE OF HIS FIVE SONS NATHAN ROAD TO LONDON TO START A CURRENCY BUSINESS SIMILAR TO HIS FATHER'S WITH THIS FOUNDATION IN PLACE MEYER HAD NO TROUBLE MOVING HELMS FORTUNE TO LONDON
YOU1000000132_S0000018	WHERE HE THEN LOANED IT OUT TO THE BRITISH CROWN IN ESSENCE WILHELM WAS FUNDING THE BRITISH TO FIGHT NAPOLEON IN ORDER TO RESTORE HIS POWER NOW MEYER DIED IN EIGHT TWELVE LEAVING WILHELM'S FORTUNE AND THE ROTHSCHILD LEGACY IN THE HANDS OF NATHAN
YOU1000000132_S0000019	HE REMAINED IN LONDON WHILE HIS ELDEST BROTHER TOOK OVER THE ORIGINAL FRANKFORT BUSINESS MEANWHILE THE THREE REMAINING BROTHERS SCATTERED THROUGHOUT EUROPE ESTABLISHING BRANCHES IN IMPORTANT EUROPEAN CAPITALS
YOU1000000132_S0000020	DESPITE THE DISTANCE THE BROTHERS APPLIED A UNIFIED STRATEGY THEY WOULD LOAN OUT THEIR MONEY TO THE ARISTOCRACY AND TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE BROTHER IN FRANCE FOR EXAMPLE BECAME THE BANKER OF LEOPOLD THE FIRST OF BELGIUM
YOU1000000132_S0000021	WHILE THE ONE IN VIENNA WOULD LEND MONEY TO THE LAST HOLY ROMAN EMPEROR FRANCIS THE SECOND IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN HE WOULD GRANT ALL FIVE BROTHERS THE NOBLE TITLE OF BARON FINALLY ELEVATING THE ROTHSCHILDS TO NOBILITY
YOU1000000132_S0000022	THROUGHOUT THE NEXT DECADES WHENEVER A EUROPEAN GOVERNMENT COLLAPSED AND WAS REPLACED IT WAS THE ROTHSCHILDS WHO WERE FIRST IN LINE TO PROVIDE LOANS THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THE FRENCH REVOLUTION OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY OR AFTER THE FALL OF THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE
YOU1000000132_S0000023	THE LOANING BUSINESS WAS IMMENSELY SUCCESSFUL THE PARIS BRANCH FOR EXAMPLE GREW FROM THE EQUIVALENT OF FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY TO OVER HALF A BILLION DOLLARS IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY
YOU1000000132_S0000024	IN ESSENCE THE FIVE ROTHSCHILD BANKING FAMILIES BACK THEN PROVIDED THE SAME SERVICE THAT THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND PROVIDES TODAY THEY STABILIZED MAJOR CURRENCIES AND PROVIDED LOANS TO GOVERNMENTS DOING BOTH AT A GREAT PROFIT
YOU1000000132_S0000026	OF COURSE THROUGHOUT THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THE FIVE BRANCHES ALSO MADE MANY PRIVATE INVESTMENTS BEYOND THEIR GOVERNMENT LOANS IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT THEY PURCHASED ONE OF THE MOST VALUABLE WINE ESTATES IN FRANCE
YOU1000000132_S0000027	IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FIVE THEY ACQUIRED A MINORITY STAKE IN THE SUEZ CANAL FROM EGYPT WHILE IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE THEY FUNDED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FIRST MAJOR OILWELL IN THE OLD WORLD CHALLENGING THE ROCKEFELLER MONOPOLY IN AMERICA
YOU1000000132_S0000028	THEY ALSO BECAME MAJORITY SHAREHOLDERS IN THE DIAMOND MONOPOLY OF THE BEARS AND IN RIO TINTO ONE OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST MINING COMPANIES BUT DURING THE TWENTIETH CENTURY THE NEWER GENERATIONS OF THE FIVE RASHID FAMILIES MADE FEWER AND FEWER SUCCESSFUL MOVES
YOU1000000132_S0000029	IN NINETEEN HUNDRED THE BRANCH IN NAPLES ACTUALLY BECAME EXTINCT WHEN THE LAST MALE HEIR DIED WITHOUT CHILDREN LEAVING HIS FORTUNE TO THE BRANCH IN PARIS A SOMEWHAT AMUSING FATE BEFELL THE BRANCH IN GERMANY
YOU1000000132_S0000030	THERE THE TWO ROTHSCHILD AIRS HAD ELEVEN GIRLS AND NOT A SINGLE BOY SPLITTING UP THE FORTUNE AND DISINTEGRATING ITS POWER THE ROTHCHILD BRANCH IN AUSTRIA WAS DOING WELL UNTIL HITLER CAME TO POWER OF COURSE
YOU1000000132_S0000031	WHEN NAZI GERMANY ANNEXED AUSTRIA IN NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT THE ROSES HAD TO SELL THEIR BANKING OPERATION FOR A FRACTION OF ITS TRUE WORTH MOST OF THEM ESCAPED WITH WHATEVER LIQUID ASSETS THEY HAD BUT AT LEAST ONE WAS CAPTURED ON HIS WAY OUT
YOU1000000132_S0000032	AND IN FACT HE WAS ONLY RELEASED AFTER PAYING THE LARGEST RANSOM IN HISTORY AT THE TIME TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS THE RANSOM EFFECTIVELY BANKRUPTED THE AUSTRIAN ROTHSCHILD WHILE THE NAZIS SEIZED ALL THEIR MANSIONS BUSINESSES AND ART
YOU1000000132_S0000033	A FEW YEARS LATER EXACTLY THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO THE BRANCH IN PARIS IN FACT THE COLLECTIONS THEY HAD WERE SO EXQUISITE THAT HITLER AND HERMANN GORING PERSONALLY WENT THERE TO OBSERVE THEM AND TO PICK OUT WHAT THEY LIKED
YOU1000000132_S0000034	THROUGH THE DETAILED INVENTORIES COMPILED BY THE NAZIS WE KNOW THAT THEY SEIZED A TOTAL OF FIVE THOUSAND AND THREE OBJECTS FROM THE ROTHSCHILD COLLECTION AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM WERE NEVER RETURNED
YOU1000000132_S0000035	THE FRENCH ROTHSCHILD HAD SOME LUCK IN RESTORING THEIR BUSINESSES AFTER THE WAR BUT THEN THE FRENCH SOCIALISTS NATIONALIZED THEIR BANK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE IN THE END ONLY THE ENGLISH BRANCH SURVIVED THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WITH ITS FORTUNE INTACT
YOU1000000132_S0000036	ITS PATRIARCH DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WAS SIR EVELYN ROTH WHO EVEN TODAY IS THE FINANCIAL ADVISER TO QUEEN ELIZABETH HE RETIRED FROM LEADERSHIP IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE PASSING THE MANTLE OF PATRIARCH TO DAVID ROTH
YOU1000000132_S0000037	A MEMBER OF THE BRANCH IN PARIS WHO THEN MERGED BOTH BRANCHES INTO A SINGLE ENTITY HE ENSURED THE SECRECY OF THE FAMILY'S FORTUNE BY ESTABLISHING A COMPLEX NETWORK OF SHELL COMPANIES STARTING OFF IN SWITZERLAND BUT ENDING GOD KNOWS WHERE
YOU1000000132_S0000038	BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WHILE THE NINETEENTH CENTURY BANKING FAMILY MIGHT HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE RICHEST OF ITS DAY TODAY ROTHSCHILDS ARE A SHADOW OF THEIR FORMER GLORY IN FACT IF YOU OPEN UP THE FORBES LIST OF BILLIONAIRES
YOU1000000132_S0000039	THE FIRST ROTHCHILD APPEARS AT NUMBER EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO THAT'S JEFF ROTHSCHILD A MAN WHO ACTUALLY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ROTHSCHILD BANKING FAMILY
YOU1000000132_S0000040	HE HAS NO BLOOD CONNECTION HE JUST HAPPENS TO SHARE THE NAME IN THE SAME WAY THE TWO MEN BEARING THE FAMILY NAMED GOLDMAN MIGHT NOT BE RELATED THE FIRST ACTUAL ROTH SHOW APPEARING ON THIS LIST IS ONLY AT NUMBER ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR
YOU1000000132_S0000041	AND HIS WEALTH IS TIED TO AN ASSET MANAGEMENT COMPANY THAT MANAGES OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY SO IN THE END IT TURNS OUT THAT THE ONCE POWERFUL ROTHSCHILD FAMILY IS REALLY NOTHING MORE BUT A BLIP ON THE RADAR OF GLOBAL WEALTH
YOU1000000132_S0000042	AND IT HONESTLY MAKES SENSE STATISTICALLY NINETY PERCENT OF WEALTHY FAMILIES LOSE THEIR FORTUNES BY THE THIRD GENERATION IT'S JUST HARD TO BE FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE WHEN YOU'RE BORN INTO WEALTH AND HAVE NO RESPECT FOR MONEY
YOU1000000132_S0000043	WHY BOTHER LEARNING HOW TO INVEST AND GROW YOUR WEALTH WHEN YOU CAN JUST SPEND WHATEVER GRANDPA LEFT YOU WELL IF YOU WANT TO ESCAPE THIS VICIOUS CYCLE OR AT LEAST KICK THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD FOR ANOTHER GENERATION

YOU1000000132_S0000049	WE'LL SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN IN TWO WEEKS AND UNTIL THEN STAY SMART
YOU1000000133_S0000000	THE INTERNET HAS COMPLETELY CHANGED THE WAY WE WATCH TELEVISION GONE ARE THE DAYS WHEN THE WHOLE FAMILY WOULD GATHER IN THE LIVING ROOM TO ENJOY THE EXACT SAME PROGRAM AS EVERYONE ELSE
YOU1000000133_S0000001	TECHNOLOGY HAS ADVANCED TO THE POINT WHERE WE'VE DUMPED THE OLD IMMOVABLE BOXES IN FAVOR OF OUR PHONES AND COMPUTERS IN TODAY'S WORLD YOU CAN WATCH WHATEVER YOU WANT WHENEVER YOU WANT ON DEMAND STRAIGHT FROM THE INTERNET
YOU1000000133_S0000002	WE ARE NOW IN THE AGE OF VIDEO ON DEMAND AND SO THIS WEEK ON BEHIND THE BUSINESS WE'LL BE TAKING A LOOK AT THE COMPANY THAT LIES AT THE HEART OF THIS RECENT REVOLUTION NETFLIX
YOU1000000133_S0000004	THE YEAR IS NINETEEN NINETY ONE AND REED HASTINGS WAS GETTING READY TO START HIS FIRST COMPANY HASTINGS WAS A RATHER UNUSUAL TECH ENTREPRENEUR
YOU1000000133_S0000005	HE CAME FROM MINNESOTA AND AFTER GRADUATING FROM COLLEGE AND SERVING BRIEFLY IN THE MILITARY HE DECIDED TO TRAVEL TO SWAZILAND WITH THE PEACE CORPS TO TEACH MATH
YOU1000000133_S0000006	AFTER RETURNING TO THE US AND GETTING A MASTER'S IN COMPUTER SCIENCE HE AND TWO OF HIS FRIENDS STARTED A COMPANY IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE CALLED PURE SOFTWARE THE COMPANY SOLD A RANGE OF DEBUGGING TOOLS FOR UNIX OPERATING SYSTEMS AT A TIME WHEN THERE WERE FEW GOOD ONES ON THE MARKET
YOU1000000133_S0000007	AND SO IT RAPIDLY BECAME A BIG PLAYER IN THE WORLD IT DOUBLED ITS REVENUE EVERY YEAR FOR FOUR YEARS IN A ROW AND IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX IT WAS SOLD TO RATIONAL SOFTWARE FOR SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS
YOU1000000133_S0000008	IN THE SPAN OF HALF A DECADE HASTINGS HAD BECOME A MILLIONAIRE
YOU1000000133_S0000009	LIFE SEEMED GREAT BUT IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN HE SUFFERED AN INCONVENIENCE THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY BECOME A WORLD CHANGER HASTINGS HAD FORGOTTEN TO RETURN HIS VIDEO RENTAL OF APOLLO THIRTEEN AND AS A RESULT WAS SLAPPED WITH A FORTY DOLLAR LATE FEE
YOU1000000133_S0000010	HE WAS EMBARRASSED AND DIDN'T WANT TO TELL HIS WIFE AND THAT GOT HIM THINKING OF A SOLUTION NOT JUST A SOLUTION TO HIS OWN LATE FEE PROBLEM BUT A SOLUTION TO EVERYONE'S PROBLEM AN ENTIRELY NEW SYSTEM OF FILM RENTALS THAT WOULD MAKE LATE FEES OBSOLETE
YOU1000000133_S0000011	TOGETHER WITH A FRIEND OF HIS ON AUGUST TWENTY NINTH NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN IN SCOTTS VALLEY CALIFORNIA HASTINGS FOUNDED A BRAND NEW MOVIE RENTAL SERVICE CALLED NETFLIX WITH THE IDEA OF MAILING DVDS TO PAYING CUSTOMERS
YOU1000000133_S0000012	THE CREATION OF NETFLIX WAS ESSENTIALLY A BET ON THE DVD PLAYER NOW THE DVD PLAYER HAD BEEN INVENTED IN TAIWAN IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR BY SONY BUT IT WOULDN'T BE UNTIL MARCH NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN THAT ONE WAS FIRST SOLD IN THE U S
YOU1000000133_S0000013	BACK THEN A PLAYER COST OVER A THOUSAND DOLLARS AND WHEN NETFLIX WAS FORMED LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF AMERICANS ACTUALLY OWNED ONE
YOU1000000133_S0000014	IN A MOVE THAT SEEMED INSANE AT THE TIME HASTINGS GAMBLED EVERYTHING ON THE POTENTIAL OF DVD TECHNOLOGY TO REPLACE THE BULKIER LOWER RESOLUTION VIDEOTAPE AS THE NATION'S FORMAT OF CHOICE
YOU1000000133_S0000015	IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO RENT DVDS BECAUSE VERY FEW PLACES HAD ANY
YOU1000000133_S0000016	AFTER TRYING OVER TWO HUNDRED DIFFERENT MAILING PACKAGES AND TESTING THEM OUT BY MAILING THEM TO HIMSELF HASTINGS DISCOVERED THAT HE COULD SAFELY SHIP A DVD FOR THE SMALL COST OF A FIRST CLASS MAIL
YOU1000000133_S0000017	THIS WAY NETFLIX COULD GUARANTEE THAT MOST TITLES WOULD BE IN STOCK AND BY ENCLOSING A STAMPED RETURN MAILER THEY COULD MAKE THE EXPERIENCE OF FILM RENTAL AS CONVENIENT AS POSSIBLE
YOU1000000133_S0000018	THUS ON APRIL FOURTEEN NINETY NINETY EIGHT WITH THIRTY EMPLOYEES AND AN ASSORTMENT OF NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE TITLES NETFLIX OPEN FOR BUSINESS
YOU1000000133_S0000019	THEIR FIRST OFFER WAS FOR A SEVEN DAY RENTAL WITH THE PRICE OF FOUR DOLLARS PLUS A TWO DOLLARS SHIPPING FEE THEY ALSO INTRODUCED SOMETHING THAT IS NOW ONE OF NETFLIX'S PROUDEST HOLE MARKS SMART SUGGESTION ALGORITHMS
YOU1000000133_S0000020	ONCE A CUSTOMER HAD RENTED ENOUGH TITLES NETFLIX COULD AUTOMATICALLY SUGGEST NEW MOVIES THAT WERE LIKELY TO INTEREST THEM NOWADAYS WHEN GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT US IT'S EASY TO TAKE SUCH ALGORITHMS FOR GRANTED BUT IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN THEY WERE PRACTICALLY UNHEARD OF
YOU1000000133_S0000021	NETFLIX STARTED STRONG AND JUST FORTY EIGHT HOURS AFTER OPENING THEY HAD TO UPGRADE THEIR WEBSITES BANDWIDTH DUE TO THE EXCESSIVE TRAFFIC THEY WERE RECEIVING
YOU1000000133_S0000022	SOON NETFLIX SIGNED PROMOTIONAL DEALS WITH TOSHIBA HEWLETT PACKARD AND SONY WHEREBY THEY OFFERED FREE RENTALS TO PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT NEW DVD PLAYERS
YOU1000000133_S0000023	IN JULY NINETEEN NINETY NINE NETFLIX SECURED A THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS CAPITAL INJECTION FROM GROUP ARNO WHICH ALLOWED THEM TO START A SUBSCRIPTION BASED SERVICE CALLED THE MARK PROGRAM
YOU1000000133_S0000024	FOR JUST UNDER SIXTEEN DOLLARS PER MONTH CUSTOMERS COULD RENT OUT AS MANY DVDS AS THEY WANTED AS LONG AS THEY HAD NO MORE THAN FOUR DVDS AT ANY GIVEN TIME NO LATE FEES NO DUE DATES IT WAS PERFECT
YOU1000000133_S0000025	BY THAT POINT NETFLIX WAS ALREADY RECEIVING TEN THOUSAND DVD ORDERS EVERY DAY BUT THEIR TOTAL REVENUE WAS SITTING AT BARELY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS COMPARE THIS TO BLOCKBUSTER'S FOUR AND A HALF BILLION DOLLAR REVENUE AND YOU'LL PROBABLY SEE WHY NETFLIX DECIDED TO TRY TO TEAM UP WITH THEM
YOU1000000133_S0000026	BLOG BUSTER WAS ONE OF THE OLDEST VIDEO RENTAL COMPANIES AND IT WAS BY FAR THE LARGEST WITH SIXTY THOUSAND EMPLOYEES AND EIGHT THOUSAND STORES SPREAD ACROSS THE US
YOU1000000133_S0000027	AS THE POPULARITY OF NETFLIX GREW EVERYONE THOUGHT BLOCKBUSTER WOULD SOON ENTER THE MARKET AND WITH THEIR VAST RESOURCES THEY WOULD HAVE PROBABLY CRUSHED THEIR YOUNG COMPETITOR
YOU1000000133_S0000028	THAT'S WHY NETFLIX DECIDED TO ACT FIRST AND SO IN THE EARLY YEAR TWO THOUSAND THEY INVITED BLOCKBUSTER TO BECOME A STRATEGIC PARTNER AND INVESTOR
YOU1000000133_S0000029	NETFLIX WOULD BECOME THE INTERNET ARM OF THE BLOG BOSTER BRAND DROPPING THE NETFLIX NAME ALTOGETHER IN FAVOUR OF BLOG BOSTER DOT COM
YOU1000000133_S0000030	BLOCKBUSTER LET THEM OUT OF THE BOARDROOM THEY WERE CERTAIN NETFLIX WOULD CRUMBLE AS IT HAD YET TO TURN A PROFIT THREE YEARS AFTER ITS CREATION INSTEAD A FEW MONTHS LATER BLOCKBUSTER PARTNERED UP WITH ENRON BROADBAND
YOU1000000133_S0000031	DIVISION OF THE ENERGY COMPANY YOU PROBABLY KNOW TODAY FOR ITS NOTORIOUSLY FRAUDULENT ACCOUNTING PRACTICES
YOU1000000133_S0000033	OF COURSE AT THE TIME NOBODY KNEW THAT AND SO INVESTORS PRAISED BLOCKBUSTERS DECISION THE SITUATION FOR NETFLIX LOOKED GRIM THEY WERE LOSING MONEY FAST AND BY THE END OF THE YEAR THEY REPORTED A NET LOSS OF FIFTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS
YOU1000000133_S0000034	DESPITE DOUBTS COMING FROM ALL SIDES HASTINGS WAS CONVINCED THAT DVD TECHNOLOGY WOULD PREVAIL THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERED TO HIM WAS TO SIMPLY SURVIVE UNTIL THAT HAPPENED TWO THOUSAND AND ONE WAS THE YEAR WHEN THINGS FINALLY STARTED GOING HIS WAY
YOU1000000133_S0000035	THE PRICE OF DVD PLAYERS PLUMMETED WITH SOME GOING AROUND FOR LESS THAN A HUNDRED BUCKS TWO THOUSAND ONE ALSO SAW THE NINE ELEVEN TERRORIST ATTACKS FEARFUL AMERICANS TOOK REFUGE IN THEIR HOMES AND NETFLIX SUBSCRIPTION SKYROCKETED
YOU1000000133_S0000036	DESPITE GROWING AT AN UNPRECEDENTED RATE NETFLIX STILL HADN'T TURNED A PROFIT AND SO IN TWO THOUSAND TWO THEY WENT PUBLIC TO KEEP THE COMPANY GOING IN TWO THOUSAND THREE THEY CROSSED THE ONE MILLION SUBSCRIBER MARK AND FINALLY HAD THEIR FIRST PROFITABLE YEAR
YOU1000000133_S0000037	JUST AS THEIR FORTUNES STARTED TO TURN HOWEVER IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR BLOCKBUSTER FINALLY RELEASED THEIR OWN ONLINE DVD MAIL SERVICE BEFORE LONG WALMART ALSO JOINED THE FRAY AND A THREE WAY BATTLE TO UNDERCUT ONE ANOTHER ENSUED
YOU1000000133_S0000038	BLOCKBUSTER AND WALMART HOWEVER WERE A BIT LATE TO THE PARTY HASTINGS ADMITTED THAT IF THEY HAD STARTED TWO YEARS EARLIER THEY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE WON ON AN END OF YEAR CONFERENCE CALL HASTINGS DECLARED BLOCKBUSTER HAS THROWN EVERYTHING BUT THE KITCHEN SINK AT US
YOU1000000133_S0000039	WHEN THE CEO OF BLOG BUSTER HEARD THAT HE PROMPTLY HAD A KITCHEN SINK DELIVERED TO THE NETFLIX OFFICE A FAIRLY CREATIVE WAY OF DECLARING WAR
YOU1000000133_S0000040	AS THE COMPETITORS UNDERCUT ONE ANOTHER NETFLIX SAW ITS BRIEF PROFITABILITY EVAPORATE AND ITS STOCK FELL BY SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT
YOU1000000133_S0000041	DESPITE LOSING MONEY THEY KEPT ON GROWING AND BY TWO THOUSAND FIVE NETFLIX WAS SHIPPING ONE MILLION DVDS EVERY DAY FROM THEIR ASSORTMENT OF OVER THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND TITLES EVENTUALLY THIS DRAWN OUT BATTLE OF ATTRITION TOOK ITS TOLL
YOU1000000133_S0000042	AND IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE WALMART DECIDED TO QUIT BLOG BUSTER FOLLOWED SUIT AND AS THE ERA OF BRICK AND MORTAR VIDEO RENTAL CAME TO AN END SO DID THEIR SUCCESS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE SAME CEO THAT HAD REJECTED NETFLIX WAS FIRED
YOU1000000133_S0000043	BY TWO THOUSAND TEN BLOCKBUSTER HAD FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY NETFLIX HAD EMERGED VICTORIOUS AND IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN IT CELEBRATED THE DELIVERY OF ITS BILLIONTH DVD THEN IN A SINGLE ANNOUNCEMENT HASTINGS BEGAN THE JOURNEY OF MAKING THE VERY BEDROCK OF HIS COMPANY OBSOLETE
YOU1000000133_S0000044	THIS WAS HIS END GAME THE REASON HE HAD BEEN WILLING TO SACRIFICE PROPHETS FOR SO LONG AND THE SAME REASON HE HAD PROPHETICALLY CITED BACK IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND VIDEO ON DEMAND
YOU1000000133_S0000046	NETFLIX FIRST STARTED OFFERING STREAMING OF ON DEMAND VIDEOS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND INITIALLY THE SERVICE WAS AT NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE AT FIRST MOVIE RITES WERE HARD TO COME BY AND THE VIDEOS AVAILABLE TO STREAM ON NETFLIX WERE WELL PRETTY AWFUL
YOU1000000133_S0000047	BUT IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT THEY SIGNED A DEAL WITH PREMIUM CABLE OUTLET STARS WHICH BROUGHT IN SOME HUGE DISNEY AND ONE LIBRARY RELEASES THE DEAL COST NETFLIX ONLY TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS PRICE THEY SOON DISCOVERED WAS AN ABSOLUTE BARGAIN
YOU1000000133_S0000048	THE REASON NETFLIX GOT SUCH A GREAT PRICE WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE THE ONLY BIG PLAYER IN TOWN AND PRETTY SOON THEY SIGNED DEALS WITH PARAMOUNT MGM AND LIONSGATE
YOU1000000133_S0000049	NETFLIX WERE ALSO PUSHING FOR PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER BRANDS AND BEFORE LONG THEY WERE FEATURED ON NEARLY EVERY MAJOR ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM ON THE PLANET THEY BUDDED UP WITH APPLE PLAYSTATION BOX NINTENDO AND A BUNCH OF OTHER BRANDS
YOU1000000133_S0000050	BY TWO THOUSAND TEN NEARLY THIRTY PERCENT OF ALL NORTH AMERICAN BROADBAND TRAFFIC DURING PEAK HOURS CAME FROM NETFLIX THEY EXPANDED INTO CANADA IN TWO THOUSAND TEN LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AND EUROPE IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE
YOU1000000133_S0000051	TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN TURNED OUT TO BE A YEAR OF HUGE SURPRISES FOR NETFLIX IN RESPONSE TO THE EVER INCREASING COST OF CONTENT STREAMING LICENSES NETFLIX ANNOUNCED THE PRODUCTION OF THEIR FIRST PIECE OF ORIGINAL CONTENT IT WOULD BE A POLITICAL DRAMA CALLED HOUSE OF CARDS
YOU1000000133_S0000052	FEATURING KEVIN SPACEY AND DIRECTED BY DAVID FINCHER NETFLIX MANAGED TO OUTBID HBO BY ORDERING THE FIRST TWO SEASONS UPFRONT FOR ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN OCTOBER OF THAT YEAR HOWEVER NETFLIX MADE A MUCH LESS SUCCESSFUL MOVE
YOU1000000133_S0000053	THEY INTRODUCED A NEW SERVICE CALLED QUICKER WHICH YES IS SPELLED WITH IN REALITY THERE WAS NOTHING NEW ABOUT QUICKER AT ALL IT WAS BASICALLY THE SPIN OFF OF NETFLIX'S OLD DVD RENTAL SERVICE
YOU1000000133_S0000054	THE BRANDING WAS SLOPPY UNIMAGINATIVE AND JUST NOT THOUGHT OUT BUT THE PUBLIC'S RESPONSE TO QUINTER WAS EVEN WORSE NETFLIX LOST EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND SUBSCRIBERS IN A SINGLE MONTH AND THREE MONTHS LATER THEIR SHARES HAD LOST TWO THIRDS OF THEIR VALUE
YOU1000000133_S0000055	UNSURPRISINGLY THEY SHOUT QUITE DOWN THE VERY NEXT MONTH BRINGING THE TWO ARMS OF THE BUSINESS BACK TOGETHER THE FIRST PIECE OF NETFLIX ORIGINAL CONTENT WAS LILLIHAMMER WHICH AIRED ON FEBRUARY SIX TWO THOUSAND TWELVE
YOU1000000133_S0000056	IT WAS A RELATIVE SUCCESS AND IT PAVED THE WAY FOR THE BIGGER SHOWS THAT WERE TO FOLLOW IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN FIRST AND FOREMOST WAS HOUSE OF CARDS WHICH FIRST AIRED ON FEBRUARY FIRST AND BECAME ONE OF NETFLIX'S MOST ACCLAIMED TITLES
YOU1000000133_S0000057	AIRING THE ENTIRE FIRST SEASON ALL AT ONCE WAS A BOLD MOVE BY NETFLIX AND IT REVOLUTIONIZED THE WAY PEOPLE WATCH TV SHOWS FOLLOWING THE SAME FORMAT AM ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT IN MAY AND ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK IN JULY
YOU1000000133_S0000058	NETFLIX CONTINUED TO USE SUGGESTION ALGORITHMS TO KEEP PEOPLE GLUED TO THEIR COMPUTERS WATCHING SERIES AFTER SERIES EACH AVAILABLE IN ITS ENTIRETY ON DEMAND
YOU1000000133_S0000060	THESE ALGORITHMS HAVE BECOME EXPONENTIALLY SMARTER IN RECENT YEARS AND THEY CAN NOW SPOT GAPS IN THE MARKET GIVING NETFLIX AN EDGE IN DEVELOPING NEW SHOWS
YOU1000000133_S0000061	AT THIS POINT NETFLIX CAN CREATE ORIGINAL CONTENT BASED SOLELY ON WHAT THEIR CUSTOMERS WANT BEFORE THEY EVEN KNOW THEY WANT IT
YOU1000000133_S0000062	THAT STRATEGY HAS WORKED OUT MARVELLOUSLY FOR THEM SO FAR AND IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN NETFLIX RECEIVED FOURTEEN EMMY NOMINATIONS NINE OF WHICH WERE FOR HOUSE OF CARDS
YOU1000000133_S0000063	THEY CONTINUE TO CREATE ORIGINAL CONTENT FROM TV SERIES TO DOCUMENTARIES TO MOVIES THOUGH PERHAPS THEIR FAITH IN ADAM SANDLER WITH WHOM THEY'RE RELEASING FOUR NEW MOVIES IS SOMEWHAT MISPLACED
YOU1000000133_S0000064	BY THE END OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN NETFLIX WILL HAVE RELEASED SIX HUNDRED HOURS OF NEW ORIGINAL CONTENT FOR THE YEAR AND THEY WILL HAVE SPENT A WHOPPING SIX BILLION DOLLARS ON CONTENT ACQUISITION THIS AGGRESSIVE EXPANSION IS THE ONLY OPTION THEY HAVE
YOU1000000133_S0000065	WITH AMAZON AND HULU KNOCKING ON THE DOOR WITH THEIR OWN ON DEMAND SERVICES AND ORIGINAL CONTENT RECENTLY NETFLIX INTEGRATED ITS SERVICE WITH COMCAST X ONE PLATFORM A DEAL THAT COULD BRING THEM UPWARDS OF FOUR MILLION NEW SUBSCRIBERS
YOU1000000133_S0000066	IN SUCH A COMPETITIVE MARKET HOWEVER A SINGLE MISTAKE CAN BE DEADLY AND THERE ARE MORE THAN ENOUGH COMPANIES OUT THERE EAGERLY AWAITING NETFLIX'S NEXT TUMBLE IT'S STILL ON TOP AT THE MOMENT BUT THE REAL QUESTION IS HOW LONG CAN IT STAY THERE

YOU1000000134_S0000113	GOOGLE CO FOUNDERS LARRY PAGE AND SERGEY BRIN HAD CREATED A NEW SEARCH ENGINE BUT HAD YET TO FIND A WAY TO TURN IT INTO PROFIT
YOU1000000134_S0000114	THEY DIDN'T LIKE THE IDEA OF USING ADVERTISING TO CASH IN
YOU1000000134_S0000115	AT FIRST THEY THOUGHT ADVERTISING WAS GRUBBY COMMERCIAL KIND OF UNSEEMLY
YOU1000000134_S0000116	THEIR FAMOUSLY SPARSE HOME PAGE WAS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED BY SERGEY BRIN
YOU1000000134_S0000117	UNLIKE RIVALS YAHOO AND AL PAGE AND BEEN REFUSED TO CLUTTER THEIR HOMEPAGE WITH ADS

YOU1000000134_S0000125	THEY INVENTED A NEW WAY OF TARGETING TEXT ADS TRIGGERED BY SEARCH REQUESTS
YOU1000000134_S0000126	INSTEAD OF DISTRACTING POP UPS OR FLASHING ADS THESE SMALL ADS WERE PLACED ABOVE AND NEXT TO SEARCH RESULTS
YOU1000000134_S0000127	IT'S FAMILIAR NOW BUT REVOLUTIONARY BACK THEN

YOU1000000134_S0000296	IT'S BEEN A GREAT EXPERIENCE FOR ME TO SEE THEM GROW OVER THE LAST TWELVE YEARS THAT I'VE KNOWN THEM I FEEL EXTREMELY PROUD OF WHAT THEY'VE ACCOMPLISHED
YOU1000000134_S0000297	LARRY AND SERGEY ALWAYS HAD THIS KIND OF IRREVERENCE AS PART OF THEIR ATTITUDE WHICH IS WHAT MADE THEM SO CREATIVE IT'S GREAT
YOU1000000134_S0000298	I THINK GOOGLE ATTRACTS PEOPLE WHO CARE WHO CARE ABOUT USERS WHO CARE ABOUT THEIR FELLOW HUMAN WHO CARE ABOUT THE PLANET AND JUST CAN'T SIT STILL THEY BUILT A COMPANY THAT ABSOLUTELY CHANGED THE WORLD
YOU1000000135_S0000000	SPACEX AND TESLA YOU WOULD BE HARD PRESSED TO FIND TWO COMPANIES THAT ARE MORE POPULAR TODAY
YOU1000000135_S0000001	AND YET IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT PAST BOTH COMPANIES WERE BASICALLY UNKNOWN AND WERE IN FACT SIMULTANEOUSLY ON THE VERGE OF BANKRUPTCY
YOU1000000135_S0000002	TODAY WE'LL LEARN HOW ELON MUSK DID WHAT NO OTHER AMERICAN CEO HAD EVER DONE BEFORE HE CREATED AND THEN RESCUED TWO COMPANIES AT THE SAME TIME
YOU1000000135_S0000003	AND BROUGHT THEM BOTH TO MULTI BILLION DOLLAR VALUATION
YOU1000000135_S0000005	THIS VIDEO IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY AUDIBLE AND THE STORY PRESENTED IN IT IS JUST ONE CHAPTER OF ELON MUSK'S AWESOME BIOGRAPHY
YOU1000000135_S0000006	WHICH YOU CAN LISTEN TO FOR FREE AS PART OF YOUR THIRTY DAY FREE TRIAL IF YOU REGISTER WITH THE LINK IN THE DESCRIPTION
YOU1000000135_S0000008	IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSAND ELON MUSK ACHIEVED WHAT ANY ENTREPRENEUR WOULD DREAM OF ACHIEVING HE SUCCESSFULLY SOLD HIS COMPANY FOR OVER A BILLION DOLLARS
YOU1000000135_S0000009	HE PERSONALLY RECEIVED HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE MILLION AND NOW THIS IS WHERE MOST PEOPLE WOULD CALL IT QUITS BUT FOR ELAN THIS WAS JUST THE BEGINNING
YOU1000000135_S0000010	HE WANTED TO CHANGE THE WORLD FOR THE BETTER AND ONE OF HIS IDEAS WAS TO SEND A GREENHOUSE TO MARS
YOU1000000135_S0000011	IN ORDER TO BOOST PUBLIC INTEREST IN SPACE EXPLORATION AND HOPEFULLY INCREASE NASA'S BUDGET
YOU1000000135_S0000012	THE IDEA WAS OUTLANDISHLY AMBITIOUS ESPECIALLY BECAUSE LAN WANTED TO SPEND NO MORE THAN TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ON IT
YOU1000000135_S0000013	NOW AT THE TIME SENDING JUST FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS TO ORBIT COULD EASILY COST UPWARDS OF THIRTY MILLION BUT ELON HAD A PLAN
YOU1000000135_S0000014	HE TRAVELED TO RUSSIA WHERE HE TRIED TO BUY REFURBISHED INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC MISSILES
YOU1000000135_S0000015	BUT THE LOWEST PRICE THE RUSSIANS GAVE HIM WAS EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS APIECE ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT ABOVE HIS BUDGET FOR THE ROCKET ITSELF
YOU1000000135_S0000016	ON THE WAY BACK FROM MOSCOW ILAN DID SOME BACK OF THE NAPKIN CALCULATIONS
YOU1000000135_S0000017	HE FIGURED OUT THAT THE RAW MATERIALS USED IN THE MAKING OF A ROCKET WERE ONLY ABOUT THREE PERCENT OF THE FINAL SALES PRICE
YOU1000000135_S0000018	INSTANTLY ELAN KNEW WHAT HE HAD TO DO IF HE WANTED TO SEND ANYTHING TO MARS HE'D HAVE TO BUILD HIMSELF A VERTICALLY INTEGRATED ROCKET COMPANY
YOU1000000135_S0000019	TO THAT END HE READ SEVERAL BOOKS ON ROCKETRY FROM THE COLD WAR AND IN JUNE TWO THOUSAND AND TWO HE INCORPORATED SPACE EXPLORATION TECHNOLOGIES OR SPACEX FOR SHORT
YOU1000000135_S0000020	HE THEN SET ABOUT RECRUITING THE RIGHT PEOPLE WHO COULD MAKE HIS VISION A REALITY
YOU1000000135_S0000021	HIS IDEAL CANDIDATE WAS YOUNG SINGLE EDUCATED AND READY TO GIVE UP HIS SOCIAL LIFE FOR SPACE
YOU1000000135_S0000022	ILAN'S RECRUITMENT STRATEGY WAS VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD
YOU1000000135_S0000023	HE'D BASICALLY COUP ANYONE FITTING THAT PROFILE FROM FRESH AEROSPACE GRADUATES TO THE RISING STARS IN BOEING AND LOCKHEED MARTIN
YOU1000000135_S0000024	AT FIRST PEOPLE THOUGHT ELON WAS MAKING PRANKS BUT WITHIN A YEAR HE HAD ASSEMBLED SOME OF THE BRIGHTEST ENGINEERS IN AMERICA
YOU1000000135_S0000025	TOGETHER THEY WOULD DESIGN ALMOST EVERYTHING FOR SPACEX FROM THE ENGINES AND ROCKET BODIES TO EVEN THE SMALLEST DETAILS LIKE THE CIRCUITRY
YOU1000000135_S0000026	IN MANY CASES THE ENGINEERS COULD BUILD STRONGER AND MORE LIGHTWEIGHT COMPONENTS AT JUST A FRACTION OF THE REGULAR PRICE
YOU1000000135_S0000027	THESE COMPONENTS WOULD BE USED TO BUILD THE MERLIN ENGINE WHICH IN TURN WOULD POWER ILAN'S FIRST ROCKET THE FALCON ONE
YOU1000000135_S0000028	DEVELOPMENT WAS FAR FROM SMOOTH OF COURSE BUT NEVERTHELESS PROGRESS WAS BEING MADE BUT THEN ILAN DECIDED TO UP THE ANTE
YOU1000000135_S0000029	IN EARLY TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR HE PARTICIPATED IN THE FUNDING ROUND OF A NEW ELECTRIC CAR COMPANY CALLED TESLA
YOU1000000135_S0000030	HE PERSONALLY INVESTED A LITTLE OVER SIX MILLION AND IN RETURN BECAME THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMPANY'S BOARD
YOU1000000135_S0000031	RIGHT OFF THE BAT ELON BEGAN APPLYING HIS EXPERIENCE FROM SPACEX AT TESLA
YOU1000000135_S0000032	THE COMPANY'S LOGO FOR EXAMPLE WAS CREATED BY THE SAME PEOPLE THAT MADE THE LOGO FOR SPACEX
YOU1000000135_S0000033	AND OF COURSE ELON WAS QUICK TO USE THE SAME AGGRESSIVE HIRING STRATEGY HE USED TO ASSEMBLE THE SPACEX TEAM
YOU1000000135_S0000034	THIS TIME HOWEVER INSTEAD OF POACHING EMPLOYEES FROM BEING HE WAS HIRING FROM APPLE
YOU1000000135_S0000035	BEFORE LONG THE TESLA TEAM WAS WORKING ON THEIR FIRST ELECTRIC CAR THE TESLA ROADSTER BACK AT SPACEX ENGINEERS WERE CLOCKING IN SIXTY HOUR WORKWEEK
YOU1000000135_S0000036	WHILE ELON WAS PROMISING VERY AMBITIOUS TIMELINES
YOU1000000135_S0000037	IN FACT HIS ORIGINAL ESTIMATE WAS TO LAUNCH THE FALCON ONE IN NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND AND THREE JUST EIGHTEEN MONTHS AFTER THE COMPANY WAS FOUNDED
YOU1000000135_S0000038	OF COURSE THAT ESTIMATE GOT PUSHED BACK AND THE FALCON ONE WOULDN'T LIFT OFF UNTIL MARCH TWO THOUSAND AND SIX
YOU1000000135_S0000039	WHEN IT SPENT A TOTAL OF FORTY ONE SECONDS IN THE AIR BEFORE CRASHING DOWN VIOLENTLY LIKE FOR SPACEX TWO THOUSAND AND SIX WAS A BIG YEAR FOR TESLA
YOU1000000135_S0000040	IN JULY THE TESLA ROADSTER MADE ITS FIRST OFFICIAL APPEARANCE AND RECORDED ONE HUNDRED PRE ORDERS IN ITS FIRST DAY
YOU1000000135_S0000041	BUT LIKE WITH THE FALCON ONE THE ACTUAL PRODUCTION WASN'T GOING VERY WELL TESLA'S CEO AT THE TIME WAS MARTIN EBERHARD
YOU1000000135_S0000042	AND LIKE ELON HE WAS PROMISING UNREALISTIC TIMEFRAMES AT FIRST THE IDEA WAS TO DELIVER THE ROADSTER IN EARLY TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN
YOU1000000135_S0000043	BUT AN ESCALATING SERIES OF PRODUCTION ISSUES PUSHED THE RELEASE DATE FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY
YOU1000000135_S0000044	IN THE END MARTIN'S MISMANAGEMENT OF THE ROADSTER PROJECT GOT HIM OUSTED FROM THE VERY COMPANY HE HAD FOUNDED LEAVING ELON IN CHARGE OF EVERYTHING
YOU1000000135_S0000045	WITH FULL RESPONSIBILITY OVER BOTH COMPANIES THE STRESS WAS STARTING TO PILE UP
YOU1000000135_S0000046	ELON WITNESSED THE SECOND FAILURE OF THE FALCON ONE ROCKET WHICH DIDN'T COMPLETE IT'S ONLY TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN FLIGHT
YOU1000000135_S0000047	AT TESLA ELON STRUGGLED FIXING THE MESS LEFT BEHIND BY EBERHARD AND IN FACT THE ROSTERS PRODUCTION WOULD NOT BEGIN UNTIL MARCH TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT
YOU1000000135_S0000048	BUT THEN THINGS GOT WORSE IN AUGUST ELON LAUNCHED HIS THIRD FALCON WHEN
YOU1000000135_S0000050	WHICH NEVER MADE IT TO ORBIT AND THEN JUST ONE MONTH LATER HIS WIFE PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED THEIR DIVORCE
YOU1000000135_S0000051	BOTH OF ELON'S COMPANIES WERE STRUGGLING TO MAKE A VIABLE PRODUCT AND WERE RUNNING OUT OF MONEY FAST
YOU1000000135_S0000052	IN FACT BY LATE OCTOBER TESLA HAD ONLY NINE MILLION DOLLARS LEFT TO FUND THE ENTIRE COMPANY SALARIES WERE BEING DELAYED AND ELON WAS FACED WITH A CHOICE
YOU1000000135_S0000053	HE HAD ALREADY SPENT SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS ON TESLA AND A HUNDRED MILLION ON SPACE
YOU1000000135_S0000054	WITH WHAT LITTLE HE HAD LEFT ALLAN HAD TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO FUND AND SECURE THE FUTURE OF ONE COMPANY OR TO RISK EVERYTHING AND GAMBLE ON SAVING BOTH
YOU1000000135_S0000055	FATE GAVE ALAN LITTLE TIME TO THINK THE FOURTH AND POTENTIALLY FINAL FLIGHT OF THE FALCON ONE WAS APPROACHING
YOU1000000135_S0000056	ON SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT ILAN GOT READY FOR HIS LAST CHANCE TO SURVIVE HE STOOD IN THE SPACE CONTROL CENTER IN LA AND WAITED IN SILENCE
YOU1000000135_S0000057	THEN THE ROCKET TOOK OFF AND THE CENTER BURST OUT IN ECSTATIC APPLAUSE SPACEX HAD FINALLY DELIVERED A WORKING PRODUCT
YOU1000000135_S0000058	THE FALCON ONE BECAME THE FIRST PRIVATELY DEVELOPED ROCKET TO GO INTO ORBIT AROUND EARTH BUT ELON WASN'T IN THE CLEAR JUST YET
YOU1000000135_S0000059	A WORKING PRODUCT WOULD MEAN NOTHING IF THE COMPANY BEHIND IT WENT BANKRUPT
YOU1000000135_S0000060	IN A FRANTIC SCRAMBLE EILAN HAD TO FIGURE OUT FUNDING SOLUTIONS FOR BOTH HIS COMPANIES BEFORE THE END OF TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT AND THE TIMING COULDN'T HAVE BEEN WORSE
YOU1000000135_S0000061	ONE OF THE LARGEST AMERICAN BANKS LEHMAN BROTHERS HAD COLLAPSED AND THE GLOBAL ECONOMY WAS HEADING TOWARDS DISASTER
YOU1000000135_S0000062	IN THE MIDST OF THIS ELON WAS RAISING ALL THE PERSONAL FUNDS HE COULD TO SAVE TESLA HE LIQUIDATED HIS FEW REMAINING ASSETS AND EVEN GOT HIS COUSINS TO PITCH IN
YOU1000000135_S0000063	BUT GETTING INVESTORS ON BOARD DOESN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT AND DECEMBER WAS CREEPING IN
YOU1000000135_S0000064	ILAN HAD MANAGED TO SCRAPE TOGETHER TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS HIMSELF ANOTHER TWENTY MILLION FROM VARIOUS INVESTORS AND FIFTY MILLION FROM THE GERMAN CAR COMPANY DEMLER
YOU1000000135_S0000065	DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS IT SEEMED AS IF ONLY TESLA WAS GOING TO MAKE IT
YOU1000000135_S0000066	BUT THEN ON DECEMBER TWENTY THIRD ILAN RECEIVED A VERY UNEXPECTED CALL
YOU1000000135_S0000067	NASA HAD AWARDED SPACEX WITH A ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS CONTRACT TO RESUPPLY THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION
YOU1000000135_S0000068	THEN ON CHRISTMAS EVE THE TESLA DEAL WENT THROUGH ELON HAD SUCCESSFULLY SAVED BOTH COMPANIES FROM BANKRUPTCY
YOU1000000135_S0000069	IN LATER INTERVIEWS HE'D RECALL THESE FINAL DAYS IN DECEMBER IN PAINFUL DETAIL
YOU1000000135_S0000070	BUT I REMEMBER WAKING UP ON THE SUNDAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND THINKING LIKE DAMN THIS IS THE CLOSEST I'VE EVER GOTTEN
YOU1000000135_S0000071	AND IT'S LOOKING PRETTY GRIM BECAUSE AT THAT POINT WE EVEN THOUGH THE FOURTH LAUNCH OF SPACEX HAD SUCCEEDED WE WERE STILL RUNNING OUT OF MONEY
YOU1000000135_S0000072	BECAUSE WE HAD THREE WE HAD THREE FAILURES AND ONLY ONE SUCCESS STILL NOT ENOUGH
YOU1000000135_S0000073	AND THEN THE FINANCING ROUND FOR TESLA HAD NOT CLOSED AND WE HAD ONLY TWO DAYS MAYBE THREE TO THINK IT WAS LIKE TWO OR THREE DAYS MAYBE TO CLOSE IT BEFORE CHRISTMAS
YOU1000000135_S0000074	SO I WAS LIKE MAN THIS IS THIS COULD BE REALLY BAD END OF THE YEAR MAYBE BOTH COMPANIES WILL FAIL
YOU1000000135_S0000075	REGARDLESS OF THE STRUGGLES ELON MIGHT BE FACING TODAY IT'S WORTH KNOWING THAT TEN YEARS AGO HE OVERCAME THE IMPOSSIBLE
YOU1000000135_S0000076	NOW THIS STORY IS JUST A BRIEF CHAPTER IN THE JOURNEY OF ELON MUSK IF YOU'D LIKE TO READ THE WHOLE THING YOU SHOULD CHECK OUT ELON MUSK'S BIOGRAPHY

YOU1000000136_S0000003	THERE'S THE TARGET GO AND DO IT
YOU1000000136_S0000005	THE TIME WE JUST GOT ON AND DID IT
YOU1000000136_S0000007	THAT WAS OUR JOB
YOU1000000136_S0000009	SEVENTY YEARS AGO THEIR TARGET WAS LURKING IN A NORWEGIAN FOUR DEEP INSIDE THE ARCTIC CIRCLE THE ALLIES HAD ALREADY ATTACKED IT ON THIRTY THREE SEPARATE OCCASIONS
YOU1000000136_S0000011	WE WERE BEGINNING TO THINK THAT IT REALLY WAS UNTHINKABLE
YOU1000000136_S0000012	THEY TOLD US ON BOARD THIS IS THE STRONGEST SHIP OF THE WORLD AND NEVER CAN SINK
YOU1000000136_S0000013	THE TARGET WAS THE BATTLESHIP
YOU1000000136_S0000015	HITLER CALLED IT THE PRIDE OF THE GERMAN NAVY CHURCHILL NAMED IT THE BEAST AND HE WAS WILLING TO RISK THE RAF'S FINEST UNITS NINE SQUADRON AND THE DAM BUSTERS TO SINK IT
YOU1000000136_S0000017	IT NEVER OCCURRED TO US THAT WE WERE IN DANGER THE CHAP EITHER SIDE OF US MAY HAVE BEEN BUT WE WEREN'T
YOU1000000136_S0000018	THAT DAY THE DAM BUSTERS SHOULD HAVE BEEN SHOT OUT OF THE SKY
YOU1000000136_S0000020	WE UNCOVER NEW EVIDENCE TO HELP EXPLAIN ONE OF THE LUCKIEST ESCAPES OF THE WAR
YOU1000000136_S0000022	AND PERHAPS FOR THE FINAL TIME KEY PARTICIPANTS IN ONE OF THE MOST AUDACIOUS RAIDS OF WORLD WAR TWO TELL THEIR STORY
YOU1000000136_S0000024	WE SAID TO OURSELVES WELL WE'VE SUNK THE BEAST AT LAST
YOU1000000136_S0000026	SEVENTY YEARS AFTER THE SINKING OF THE BATTLESHIP TURPITZ HISTORIAN PATRICK BISHOP IS EXPLORING THE NORWEGIAN FORD THAT WAS ITS FINAL RESTING PLACE
YOU1000000136_S0000028	LOOKS LIKE I DON'T KNOW MAYBE ONE OF THE SHIPS PLATES YOU CAN SEE SOME RIVETING HERE SO THERE'S STILL LITTLE SCATTERED SORT OF MEMENTOS
YOU1000000136_S0000030	TURPIS LYING AROUND HERE TODAY AFTER ALL THIS TIME
YOU1000000136_S0000032	PATRICK HAS COME TO NORWAY TO FIND OUT HOW THE RAF'S NINE SQUADRON AND SIX ONE SEVEN SQUADRON THE DAM BUSTERS FINALLY MANAGED TO SINK THE UNSINKABLE BATTLESHIP
YOU1000000136_S0000033	THIS DAY IS ALWAYS COMMEMORATED AS TURBITS DAY BY SIX ONE SEVEN SQUADRON BUT IT COULD BE REMEMBERED IN A VERY DIFFERENT FASHION IT COULD HAVE BEEN REMEMBERED AS THE DAY THAT SIX ONE SEVEN SQUADRON WAS ANNIHILATED
YOU1000000136_S0000034	IT'S AN ENDURING MYSTERY WHY WAS IT THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO GET IN THEIR BOMB AND GET AWAY WITH NO LOSSES IT COULD HAVE GONE VERY VERY DIFFERENTLY
YOU1000000136_S0000036	SEVENTY YEARS AGO THE TURPIS WAS THE GREATEST SINGLE MARITIME THREAT TO THE ALLIES
YOU1000000136_S0000038	AT THIRTY FIVE MILES AN HOUR IT WAS FASTER THAN ANY BRITISH BATTLESHIP
YOU1000000136_S0000040	ITS EIGHT FIFTEEN INCH GUNS COULD FIRE SEVENTEEN MILES BEYOND THE HORIZON IT COULD SINK YOU BEFORE YOU EVEN SAW IT
YOU1000000136_S0000042	ITS ARMOR WAS SO THICK THAT CONVENTIONAL BOMBS BOUNCED OFF IT
YOU1000000136_S0000044	AN IMPRESSIVE GIANT OF A SHIP TURPITZ WAS BUILT TO BE AS NEARLY UNSINKABLE AS A SHIP COULD BE
YOU1000000136_S0000046	WHEN HITLER LAUNCHED THE TURRETS ON APRIL THE FIRST NINE THIRTY NINE IT WAS WORLDWIDE NEWS TEENAGER TONY IVERSON WAS MESMERIZED BY THE FLICKERING IMAGES
YOU1000000136_S0000048	I REMEMBER SEEING CINEMA IN YORK WHERE I LIVED SEEING A NEWSREEL OF THIS BATTLESHIP THIS HUGE THING I HAD NO IDEA WHEN I SAW THIS FROM MY GIRLFRIEND THAT ONE DAY I MIGHT BE LINKED WITH TAPIS
YOU1000000136_S0000050	TONY WAS PART OF A GENERATION WHO GREW UP WITH THE ROMANCE OF FLYING
YOU1000000136_S0000051	EVERY YOUNG MAN IN THE WORLD WANTED TO FLY IT DIDN'T HURT SOMETIMES ON A SATURDAY NIGHT WHEN YOU'D COME BACK TO THE LOCAL DANCE
YOU1000000136_S0000052	WHEN YOU HOPED A GIRL WOULD SAY WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING TODAY YOU COULD SAY OH WELL IT'S BEEN DICING WITH DEATH IN THE HEAVENS
YOU1000000136_S0000054	TONY NOW NINETY FOUR FLEW SPITFIRES IN THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN HE THEN JOINED THE ELITE BOMBER FORCE THE DAM BUSTERS
YOU1000000136_S0000056	IN NINETEEN FORTY THREE THE DAM BUSTERS SIX ONE SEVEN SQUADRON HAD BREACHED THE DAMS USING INVENTOR BARNES WALLIS BOUNCING BOMB THE SQUADRON BECAME THE RAF'S EXPERTS IN PRECISION BOMBING
YOU1000000136_S0000058	A YEAR AFTER THE DAM'S RAID MOST OF THE SQUADRON HAD MOVED ON OR HAD BEEN KILLED IN ACTION IT WAS TIME FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF THE BEST YOUNG FLYERS
YOU1000000136_S0000060	I WAS AT UNIVERSITY AND I DECIDED THAT THE AIR FORCE REALLY WAS FOR ME I MADE THE BIG MISTAKE OF SAYING THAT TWO AND TWO MAKE FOUR I SHOULD HAVE SAID FIVE
YOU1000000136_S0000062	AND BECAUSE I SAID FOR I BECAME A NAVIGATOR AND I WAS NOT VERY PLEASED AT THE TIME BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE A PILOT
YOU1000000136_S0000063	I WAS A STUDENT AND I WAS DOING ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING I DIDN'T WANT TO GO INTO THE ARMY I DIDN'T WANT TO GO INTO THE NAVY AND I THOUGHT THE AIR FORCE SOUNDED PRETTY GOOD BUT I WAS ALWAYS A BIT WORRIED ABOUT MY EYES BECAUSE THEY
YOU1000000136_S0000064	THEY WEREN'T REALLY AS GOOD AS THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN SO I JUST LEARNT THE LINES THAT THEY WERE THE BOTTOM LINE OR WHATEVER IT WAS THAT THEY WERE BEING ASKED AND REELED THAT OFF AND PASSED THE TEST
YOU1000000136_S0000066	WITHIN MONTHS OF JOINING THE DAM BUSTERS THE NEW CREWS IN THEIR LANCASTER BOMBERS WOULD BE FIGHTING IN ONE OF THE MOST INHOSPITABLE ENVIRONMENTS OF THE WAR
YOU1000000136_S0000068	AFTER THE GERMAN OCCUPATION OF NORWAY THE ARCTIC CIRCLE BECAME ONE OF THE KEY BATTLEGROUND OF THE CONFLICT
YOU1000000136_S0000069	IN JANUARY NINE FORTY TWO HITLER ORDERED HIS BIGGEST BATTLESHIP NORTH TO THREATEN THE ARCTIC CONVOYS DELIVERING ESSENTIAL SUPPLIES TO THE RUSSIANS
YOU1000000136_S0000071	CHURCHILL PROMISED STALIN THAT HE WOULD MAINTAIN THIS LIFELINE WITHOUT IT THE SOVIET WAR EFFORT WOULD COLLAPSE
YOU1000000136_S0000073	IN JUNE NINETEEN FORTY TWO THE LARGEST ARCTIC CONVOY OF THE WAR THIRTY FIVE MERCHANT SHIPS SET SAIL ESCORTED BY FORTY THREE WARSHIPS THEY WERE ONLY TOO WELL AWARE THAT THE TURPITZ WAS POISED TO POUNCE
YOU1000000136_S0000075	THE POSSIBILITY THAT IT'S GOING TO PUT TO SEA IS ENOUGH TO CREATE WHAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED I THINK AS PANIC
YOU1000000136_S0000077	THE RUMOUR CAUSED THE ADMIRALTY TO ISSUE A FATAL ORDER
YOU1000000136_S0000079	THE CONVOY IS TO SCATTER THAT MEANS THAT THE ESCORT THIS MASSIVE ESCORT THEY'VE GATHERED IS TO RETURN HOME AND THAT THESE MERCHANTMEN ARE BASICALLY ON THEIR OWN THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY DECISION
YOU1000000136_S0000080	OF THOSE SHIPS THAT SET OUT ONLY ELEVEN ACTUALLY MAKE IT TO PORT THERE'S SOME NOT BY TURPIS BUT BY GERMAN SUBMARINES AND THE LIFE WHO HAVE A FIELD DAY SO WITHOUT FIRING A SHOT
YOU1000000136_S0000081	TURPITZ HAD ACTUALLY SCORED AN ENORMOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL VICTORY AGAINST THE ALLIES
YOU1000000136_S0000083	THIS THE BIGGEST ARCTIC CONVOY LOSS OF THE WAR PROVOKED A FURIOUS RESPONSE FROM WINSTON CHURCHILL
YOU1000000136_S0000085	THE DESTRUCTION OF THIS SHIP IS THE GREATEST EVENT AT SEA AT THE PRESENT TIME NO OTHER TARGET IS COMPARABLE TO IT
YOU1000000136_S0000087	WITH ROYAL NAVY SHIPS DESPERATELY NEEDED IN THE FAR EAST THE BRITISH THREW EVERYTHING AT THE TURPIS INCLUDING DIVE BOMBERS MANNED TORPEDOES AND MIDGET SUBMARINES
YOU1000000136_S0000089	IN TWO YEARS THIRTY ONE ATTEMPTS FAILED TO SINK THE PHANTOM MENACE
YOU1000000136_S0000091	SO CHURCHILL CALLED IN THE DAM BUSTERS TO FINALLY FINISH THE JOB
YOU1000000136_S0000093	THEY WOULD HAVE JUST TWO MONTHS TO SINK THE UNSINKABLE TURPIS BEFORE THE ONSET OF THE ARCTIC WINTER
YOU1000000136_S0000095	IF THEY FAILED THE BRITISH NAVY IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC WOULD BE TIED UP UNTIL THE SPRING
YOU1000000136_S0000097	THE DAM BUSTERS WERE TO BE JOINED BY NINE SQUADRON ONE OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED IN THE RAF
YOU1000000136_S0000098	WE WERE CALLED TO A SPECIAL BRIEFING AT WOODHALL BAR AT OUR FRIENDS BASE WHERE THEIR WING COMMANDER FLYING MAN CALLED THAT
YOU1000000136_S0000099	TOOK US INTO A BRIEFING ROOM WHICH HAD BEEN TOTALLY BLACKED OUT SO WE KNEW IT WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL
YOU1000000136_S0000101	AND HE WAS A FAIRLY DRAMATIC MAN AND HE ENJOYED HAVING US ALL SIT DOWN AND THEN SUDDENLY DRAWING THE CLOTH OF A MODEL IN FRONT OF HIM
YOU1000000136_S0000102	WHICH WAS OF COURSE THE TURPIS GASP FROM EVERYBODY
YOU1000000136_S0000104	THE BEAST WAS HIDING AT THE NORTHERN TIP OF NORWAY WELL OUT OF THE RANGE OF A DIRECT ATTACK FROM BRITAIN SO THE RAF CAME UP WITH A DARING PLAN
YOU1000000136_S0000106	WE WERE TOLD TO PRACTICE A LOT OF DINGY DRILL WHILE DINGY DRILL WAS THE PROCEDURE FOR GETTING OUT OF AN AIRPLANE IF YOU HAD TO LAND IN THE SEA
YOU1000000136_S0000108	THEY WERE GOING TO ATTACK THE SHIP VIA THE SOVIET UNION
YOU1000000136_S0000110	ON SEPTEMBER THE ELEVENTH THE TWO SQUADRONS TOOK OFF ON AN UNPRECEDENTED THREE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED MILE MISSION
YOU1000000136_S0000112	THEY FIRST FLEW THE ELEVEN HUNDRED MILES TO RUSSIA
YOU1000000136_S0000114	THEN AFTER REFUELING AND AT THE VERY LIMIT OF LANCASTER'S RANGE THEY FLEW ON TO BOMB THE TURPITZ
YOU1000000136_S0000116	IN THEIR BOMBAS THEY WERE CARRYING THE NEW BARNES WALLACE DESIGNED TWELVE THOUSAND POUND TALL BOY
YOU1000000136_S0000118	IT WAS A REVOLUTIONARY PRECISION WEAPON IN THE RIGHT HANDS IT FLEW LIKE A DART
YOU1000000136_S0000120	BARNES WALLIS HAS DESIGNED IT SO IT DIDN'T TUMBLE OVER LIKE A BOMB MIGHT IT WAS DROPPED AND FLEW DIRECTLY ONTO THE POINT IT WAS AIMED AT I HOPE
YOU1000000136_S0000121	TALL BOY WAS BEAUTIFULLY DESIGNED IF YOU CAN SAY THAT ABOUT A BOMB IT HAD FINS AT THE REAR SO THAT WHEN IT FELL IT WENT INTO A SPIN THAT MEANT IT WAS FLYING VERY ACCURATELY
YOU1000000136_S0000123	THE RAID WOULD HAVE SUCH PROPAGANDA VALUE THAT A FILM CAMERA WENT ALONG TO RECORD IT
YOU1000000136_S0000125	AFTER A SIX HOUR FLIGHT FROM RUSSIA THE LANCASTERS APPROACHED THE TARGET
YOU1000000136_S0000126	I COULD SEE TURPIS OVER THE FRONT OF MY LANCASTER AND ABOUT THE SAME TIME I SAW ALL THE SMOKE GENERATOR START UP AND THEY HAD ABOUT TWO HUNDRED PLUS SO THEY FILLED THE FIELD
YOU1000000136_S0000127	VERY RAPIDLY WITH SMOKE MY MOM SAID IT'S NO GOOD SKIP I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING SO WE JUST WE JUST HAD A GO
YOU1000000136_S0000129	MOST OF THE TALL BOYS PLUNGED HARMLESSLY INTO THE SMOKESCREEN BUT HAVING SURVIVED THIS ATTACK THE TURPITZ WAS NOW FORCED TO MAKE A FATAL MOVE
YOU1000000136_S0000130	IN NINETEEN FORTY FOUR DESPITE FIVE YEARS OF CONFLICT THE CREW OF THE TURPIS WAS LARGELY IMMUNE TO THE HARDSHIPS OF THE WAR
YOU1000000136_S0000132	HISTORIAN PATRICK BISHOP HAS COME TO TROMSO'S TURPITZ MUSEUM LOCATED IN A FORMER GERMAN BUNKER
YOU1000000136_S0000134	HE'S EXPLORING THE DAILY ROUTINE ON BOARD WITH CURATOR LIFE ANDERBERG
YOU1000000136_S0000136	SO THIS IS LIKE THE YOUR WEEKLY TOBACCO ACTION YEAH
YOU1000000136_S0000137	BUT UNDER THE CARDINAL
YOU1000000136_S0000138	WHERE DO WE
YOU1000000136_S0000139	SOMETHING DIFFERENT
YOU1000000136_S0000140	OH MY GOSH I THINK WE ALL KNOW WHAT THAT IS DON'T WE
YOU1000000136_S0000142	TOBACCO AND CONDOMS
YOU1000000136_S0000143	
YOU1000000136_S0000144	TWO STAPLES OF THE OF THE SEAMAN'S EQUIPMENT WENT ASHORE
YOU1000000136_S0000145	THAT IS A COUP FOR COFFEE FROM THE SHIP TAKEN OUT BY SOME OF THE WORKERS WHO WAS CUTTING THE SHIP AFTER THE WAR
YOU1000000136_S0000146	YEAH SO I MEAN IT'S A NICE BIT OF CROCKERY THAT ISN'T IT LOOKS LIKE THEY LIVE PRETTY WELL
YOU1000000136_S0000148	THE SHIP HAD A CREW OF TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED MEN IT WAS SO LARGE IT RAN ITS OWN BAKERY CINEMA AND POSTOFFICE IT EVEN PRODUCED ITS OWN NEWSPAPER
YOU1000000136_S0000150	WAS TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD WHEN HE FIRST STEPPED ON BOARD THE FORTY TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TON TURPITZ
YOU1000000136_S0000152	WE WE WE WERE YOUNG AND WE WERE PROUD AND AND THE GIRLS LOOKED FOR OUR NICE BLUE UNIFORM YOU UNDERSTAND
YOU1000000136_S0000154	GERMAN TROOPS RETREATED ON ALL FRONTS AND STARVING GERMAN CIVILIANS FACED DAILY ATTACKS ON THEIR CITIES LIFE ON THE TURPITZ REMAINED LARGELY UNAFFECTED
YOU1000000136_S0000156	WE HAVE HAD GOOD FOOD AND CLEAN ROOMS CLEAN WASH THREE DAYS IN THE WEEK WE HAVE MEAT
YOU1000000136_S0000157	AND IN THE EVENING WE HAVE
YOU1000000136_S0000159	BUT IN OCTOBER NINETEEN FORTY FOUR AS SOVIET FORCES ADVANCED INTO NORWAY THE TURPITZ WAS MOVED A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILES SOUTH
YOU1000000136_S0000161	IT WAS A FATAL MISTAKE THE SHIP WAS NOW ALMOST WITHIN RANGE OF A DIRECT ATTACK
YOU1000000136_S0000163	THE NEWS ENCOURAGED CHURCHILL TO PILE ON THE PRESSURE
YOU1000000136_S0000165	I CONSIDER THAT EVERY EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE TO ATTACK THIS SHIP EVEN IF LOSSES HAVE TO BE INCURRED
YOU1000000136_S0000167	THE RAF WENT INTO A FRENZY OF ACTIVITY IF THE LANCASTER BOMBERS WERE COMPLETELY STRIPPED OF EXCESS WEIGHT AND FILLED WITH EXTRA FUEL THEY MIGHT JUST REACH THEIR TARGET
YOU1000000136_S0000169	OUR ENGINES WERE CHANGED AND ARMOR WAS TAKEN OUT THE ONE BEHIND THE PILOT'S SEAT WAS TAKEN OUT THE BIG PIECE OF ARMOR PLATING THEY HAD TO REDUCE THE WEIGHT SO THEY TOOK OUT THE MID UPPER TURRET IN ITS ENTIRETY
YOU1000000136_S0000170	THEY TOOK THE GUNS OUT OF THE FRONT TURRET AND REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF AMMUNITION IN THE REAR TURRET
YOU1000000136_S0000172	LOSING WEIGHT INCREASED RANGE BUT THE LANCASTERS NEEDED TO CARRY MUCH MORE ONE HUNDRED OCTANE AVIATION FUEL TO GET THEM TO TROMSO
YOU1000000136_S0000174	THE EXTRA FUEL TANK WAS A WELLINGTON
YOU1000000136_S0000176	OF TWO HUNDRED GALLONS AND A MOSQUITO TANK OF FIFTY GALLONS ONE ON TOP OF THE OTHER PLACED INSIDE THE FUSELAGE WHERE THE REED WOULD HAVE BEEN
YOU1000000136_S0000177	AND IT WAS SO DANGEROUS THAT GROUND CREW HAD TO WEAR INSOLES BECAUSE OF THE DANGER OF A SPARK IF THEY WORE THEIR BOOTS AND THAT WOULD PROBABLY BLOW UP THE WHOLE AIRCRAFT AT LEAST ONE PERHAPS SEVERAL MORE AROUND IT AS WELL
YOU1000000136_S0000178	I HAVE TO SAY THAT DESPITE ALL THE FUEL JOINTS BEING THOROUGHLY TIGHT AND NO SIGN OF ANY LEAKAGE YOU STILL COULD SMELL THAT HUNDRED OCTANE
YOU1000000136_S0000179	SO IT MAKES YOU FEEL A LITTLE BIT SICK I SUPPOSE
YOU1000000136_S0000181	ON OCTOBER THE TWENTY NINTH NINETEEN FORTY FOUR THE REFITTED LANCASTERS OF SIX ONE SEVEN AND NINE SQUADRONS TOOK OFF ON A THIRTEEN HOUR NONSTOP MISSION
YOU1000000136_S0000183	TO SUCCEED THE UNDEFENDED PLANES NEEDED TO TAKE THE TURPIS BY SURPRISE
YOU1000000136_S0000185	THEY CROSSED THE NORWEGIAN COAST WHERE THEY KNEW THERE WAS A GAP IN ENEMY RADAR AND THEY USED NEUTRAL SWEDEN TO DISGUISE THEIR APPROACH
YOU1000000136_S0000187	EVERYTHING WAS IN PLACE TO FINALLY SEND THE TURPIS TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA
YOU1000000136_S0000189	BUT THE ONE THING NOT IN THEIR CONTROL WAS THE WEATHER
YOU1000000136_S0000191	JUST THIRTY SECONDS BEFORE BOMBING COMMENCED TURPITZ WAS COVERED BY A BLANKET OF LOW CLOUD
YOU1000000136_S0000193	BUT MOST PEOPLE DIDN'T BOMB BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T SEE THE TURRETS VERY DISAPPOINTING ALL THAT PREPARATION AND ALL THAT HARD WORK AND ALL THAT FLYING
YOU1000000136_S0000194	AND TO ARRIVE TOGETHER AT THE RIGHT TIME OVER THE RIGHT POINT AND THEN TO BE WASTED IS I WON'T SAY DISHEARTENING BECAUSE WE WEREN'T DISHEARTENED ANNOYED PERHAPS
YOU1000000136_S0000196	BUT AFTER THE FAILURE OF THIS RAID THERE WAS TO BE NO LET UP THE CREWS WERE ORDERED BACK AGAIN
YOU1000000136_S0000198	THERE WAS NO TIME TO PLAN A NEW ROUTE AND THERE WAS ONE MORE SHOCK IN STORE FOR THEM
YOU1000000136_S0000199	THEY SAID SORRY TO TELL YOU CHAPS BUT SINCE THE LAST TRIP THE GERMANS HAVE MOVED TWO SQUADRONS OF FIGHTERS TO BE NEAR THE TURPIS
YOU1000000136_S0000201	NO WAY
YOU1000000136_S0000202	WELL THIS MADE US SWALLOW A LITTLE BIT
YOU1000000136_S0000203	WE WERE A LITTLE APPREHENSIVE BECAUSE OF COURSE WE HADN'T GOT THE MID UPPER TURRET BUT
YOU1000000136_S0000205	BUT NEW EVIDENCE HAS EMERGED THAT SUGGESTS THE DAM BUSTERS AND NINE SQUADRON WERE IN EVEN GREATER DANGER THAN THEY EVER IMAGINED
YOU1000000136_S0000207	IN NOVEMBER NINETEEN FORTY FOUR THE RAF WAS PREPARING TO ATTACK THE BATTLESHIP TURPIS FOR THE THIRD TIME IN TWO MONTHS THE BRITISH WERE STILL HOPING TO TAKE THE NAZIS BY SURPRISE EVEN THOUGH THEY'D BE FLYING THE SAME ROUTE
YOU1000000136_S0000209	BUT NEW EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THE GERMANS MAY HAVE BEEN EXPECTING THEM
YOU1000000136_S0000211	ON THE NORWEGIAN ISLAND OF ANDORRA HISTORIAN PATRICK BISHOP IS INVESTIGATING A STORY THAT THE GERMANS REPOSITIONED SOME OF THEIR RADAR BEFORE THE THIRD RAID
YOU1000000136_S0000213	PATRICK HAS COME TO THE SITE OF A ASMAN RADAR INSTALLATION THE MOST POWERFUL GERMAN RADAR OF THE CONFLICT HE'S WITH LOCAL RESIDENT JOHN RONALD NAUHEIM WHO WAS BROUGHT ALONG A PHOTOGRAPH HIS FATHER TOOK AT THE END OF THE WAR
YOU1000000136_S0000215	HITLER HAD THIS OBSESSION WITH THE IDEA THAT THERE WERE THE ALLIES EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE SURE NORMANDY LANDINGS HAD GONE AHEAD HE STILL CLUNG TO THIS BELIEF THAT THERE WOULD BE AN ALLIED LANDING IN NORWAY AS WELL
YOU1000000136_S0000216	AS I WAS
YOU1000000136_S0000217	I WAS TOLD THAT AREA WAS PICKING UP ALL THE THE SHIP TRAFFIC GOING TOWARDS RUSSIA
YOU1000000136_S0000218	NOW IF WE LOOK AT THIS PICTURE HERE WE'VE GOT THIS LANDMARK WHICH IS THIS VERY PROMINENT
YOU1000000136_S0000219	ROCKY ISLAND JUST BEHIND US AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IN THE BOTTOM RIGHT HAND CORNER OF THE PICTURE AND THIS BOX STRUCTURE THAT'S ON THE BACK OF THE SCAFFOLDING IF YOU LIKE IS ACTUALLY THE REAR OF THE RADAR SET SO THAT WOULD MEAN THAT THE
YOU1000000136_S0000220	THE THING IS ACTUALLY THE VITAMIN IS POINTING INLAND IT'S NOT POINTING OUT TO SEA WHERE YOU MIGHT EXPECT IT TO BE
YOU1000000136_S0000221	THIS IS VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR THE BASSMAN RADAR TO ACTUALLY PICK UP THE THE RAID AS IT CAME AND AS IT HOMED IN ON GONZO TO BOMB THE TURBITS
YOU1000000136_S0000223	WITH THE RADAR REPOSITIONED TO TRACK THE FLYERS COMING FROM INLAND ALL IT NEEDED WAS ONE PHONE CALL TO THE FIGHTER SQUADRON AT BARDUFOSS
YOU1000000136_S0000225	IN JUST THIRTEEN MINUTES THE FIGHTERS WOULD BE SWARMING AROUND THE TURPIS READY TO SHOOT THE LANCASTERS OUT OF THE SKY
YOU1000000136_S0000227	ONE OF THOSE CRACK FIGHTER PILOTS AT BARDUFOSS NOW LIVES HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
YOU1000000136_S0000229	KURT SCHULTZ AGE NINETY TWO MEETS WITH A GROUP OF VETERAN FLYERS EVERY WEEK
YOU1000000136_S0000231	SEVENTY YEARS AGO HE WOULDN'T HAVE HESITATED TO SHOOT THEM DOWN
YOU1000000136_S0000233	THE FRIENDSHIP THAT HAS DEVELOPED AND I'M SO GRATEFUL FOR THAT BECAUSE I WAS THE ENEMY
YOU1000000136_S0000235	KURT STARTED THE WAR AS A NAVIGATOR ON BOMBING RAIDS OVER ENGLAND
YOU1000000136_S0000237	BUT LATER HE BECAME A FIGHTER PILOT HE WAS POSTED TO A SQUADRON OF FIGHTER ACES BASED DEEP INSIDE THE ARCTIC CIRCLE HE WASN'T PREPARED FOR THEIR RELAXED ATTITUDE TO DISCIPLINE
YOU1000000136_S0000239	I ARRIVED JUST A FEW DAYS AFTER THEY HAD TRIED TO KILL HITLER AND YOU KNOW THE THE THE SALUTE WAS LIKE THAT
YOU1000000136_S0000241	ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY ALL WALKED IN AND INSTEAD OF GREETING LIKE THAT THEY GREETED LIKE THAT YOU KNOW SHE HEARD WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU SO BUT IT WAS A VERY LOOSE BUN
YOU1000000136_S0000242	AS FAR AS REAL DISCIPLINE WAS CONCERNED BUT THEY WERE VERY VERY SUCCESSFUL
YOU1000000136_S0000244	KURT FLEW SIXTY THREE MISSIONS AND HAD THREE CONFIRMED KILLS SOME OF HIS COLLEAGUES AT BARDUFOSS WERE AMONG THE HIGHEST SCORING ACE OF THE WAR
YOU1000000136_S0000246	HE HAD ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE VICTORIES AND I THINK CAPTAIN WHO WAS A GROUP COMMANDER HAD MAYBE A HUNDRED AND SIXTY
YOU1000000136_S0000248	THESE THREE TOGETHER HAD SIX HUNDRED VICTORIES ALMOST
YOU1000000136_S0000250	AS THE LANCASTERS TOOK OFF IN THE EARLY HOURS OF NOVEMBER THE TWELFTH FROM THE FROZEN COASTLINE OF NORTHERN SCOTLAND THE FIGHTERS AT BARDUFOSS WERE PREYING ON THEIR MINDS
YOU1000000136_S0000252	THIS WOULD BE THEIR LAST CHANCE TO SINK THE TURPIS BEFORE THE ONSET OF THE ARCTIC WINTER
YOU1000000136_S0000254	IT WAS COLD BUT WHEN YOU'RE TWENTY TWENTY ONE YOU YOU DON'T FEEL THE COLD THE SAME BUT IT WAS COLD IF WE WANTED TO HAVE SOME KIND OF
YOU1000000136_S0000255	IN THE MESS AT LAST HE PROVIDED MILK BOTTLES AND OF COURSE THERE WERE THE JOKE ABOUT THOSE
YOU1000000136_S0000257	LOOKING BACK THEY JUST PITCHED US INTO IT AS IT WERE THERE'S THE TARGET YOU'VE GOT THE WEAPON GO AND GO AND DO IT AT THE TIME WE JUST GOT ON AND DID IT
YOU1000000136_S0000259	THAT WAS OUR JOB
YOU1000000136_S0000260	IT WAS A LONG LONG JOURNEY THERE WAS NO RADIO CONTACT OF COURSE THE ONLY WAY WE COULD NAVIGATE I COULD NAVIGATE ANYHOW WAS TAKE THE ODD SHOT OF WHICHEVER STAR WAS APPROPRIATE
YOU1000000136_S0000261	AND JUST KEEP MY FINGERS CROSSED
YOU1000000136_S0000263	AT SEVEN A M THE BOMBERS TURNED EAST THROUGH WHAT THEY STILL BELIEVED WAS A RADAR GAP BUT GERMAN RECORDS SHOW THEY HAD ALREADY BEEN SPOTTED
YOU1000000136_S0000264	DEFENSELESS LADEN WITH FUEL AND WITH TWO AND A HALF TONS OF HIGH EXPLOSIVES INSIDE THEIR TALL BOY BOMBS THEY WERE EXTREMELY VULNERABLE
YOU1000000136_S0000265	WE FOUND WE WERE FLYING INTO A CLEAR SKY WHICH WHICH WAS PERFECT FOR OUR JOB ABSOLUTELY BUT THEN LITTLE THOUGHT CAME WELL IT'S IT'S PRETTY IT'LL SUIT THE FIGHTERS PRETTY WELL TOO
YOU1000000136_S0000267	AT SEVEN FORTY THE LANCASTERS BEGAN THEIR RUN INTO THE TARGET FROM NEUTRAL SWEDEN
YOU1000000136_S0000269	THE TURPITZ WAS ALREADY RECEIVING INFORMATION OF CONFUSED SIGHTINGS SOME PLACING BOMBERS ON A COURSE TO RUSSIA OTHERS PLACING THEM A HUNDRED KILOMETRES TO THE NORTH
YOU1000000136_S0000271	NO ONE ALERTED THE BARDUFOSS AIRBASE
YOU1000000136_S0000273	THEN AT EIGHT NINE THE TURPITZ ON ITS OWN RADAR SPOTTED THE BOMBER FORCE JUST THIRTY MINUTES AWAY AND IT WAS COMING STRAIGHT AT THEM
YOU1000000136_S0000275	THE ALARM FINALLY SOUNDED AT THE BARDUFOSS FIGHTER BASE AT EIGHT EIGHTEEN THIS WAS MORE THAN AN HOUR AFTER THE RAIDERS HAD FIRST BEEN SPOTTED
YOU1000000136_S0000277	SIX MINUTES LATER THE LANCASTERS PASSED A FEW MILES TO THE EAST OF BARDUFOSS ON THEIR WAY NORTH
YOU1000000136_S0000279	MY THOUGHT WAS HOPE TO CRUSH THE FIGHTERS DON'T GET NEAR US IF I GOT A ONE ONE NINE UP MY BACKSIDE AND THERE WOULD BE VERY LITTLE LEFT FINISHED WITH HIS WITH HIS CANNON
YOU1000000136_S0000281	AT EIGHT THIRTY KURT SHULTZ ARRIVED AT HIS MESSERSMITH ONE NINE FIGHTER HAD HE TAKEN OFF THEN HE COULD STILL HAVE CAUGHT THE LANCASTERS BUT KURT AND HIS COLLEAGUES LOST VITAL MINUTES GETTING OFF THE GROUND
YOU1000000136_S0000283	FOR A START THE PLANES WERE AT THE WRONG END OF THE RUNWAY AND THEN AT THE MOMENT THEY WERE READY TO TAKE OFF AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL ALLOWED A TRANSPORT PLANE TO LAND
YOU1000000136_S0000285	SO THAT'S FIFTY TWO THAT WAS COMING FLY IN AND LAND DOWN THE HILL AND SO THERE WAS ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES LOST
YOU1000000136_S0000289	JUST BEFORE EIGHT THIRTY AM THE LANCASTERS BEGAN THEIR APPROACH TO THE TURPIS RAF CAMERAS WERE AGAIN ON HAND TO FILM IT ALL SO FAR THERE WAS STILL NO SIGN OF KURT AND HIS FIGHTERS
YOU1000000136_S0000291	IT WAS SUNDAY YES I WAS STANDING ON THE DECK THEN CAME THE ALARM
YOU1000000136_S0000292	AND WE SAW THE MACHINE IN SOUTH
YOU1000000136_S0000294	AS THE LANCASTERS APPROACHED THEY WERE CONFRONTED BY THE FIRST OF TURPITZ FORMIDABLE WEAPONRY THE SHIP TRAINED ITS MASSIVE FIFTEEN INCH GUNS ONTO THE RAIDERS EACH SHELL WEIGHED MORE THAN A TON
YOU1000000136_S0000296	THE TURPIS GUNS HAD A RANGE OF SEVENTEEN MILES EVEN THE BIG HEAVY GUNS COULD BE ELEVATED TO REACH AIRCRAFT
YOU1000000136_S0000298	IT WAS A GREAT UNFOLDING ORANGE CLOUD THIS FIFTEEN INCH SHELL WENT OFF WOULD HAVE PROBABLY TAKEN TWO LANCASTER OUT OF THE SKY TOGETHER
YOU1000000136_S0000300	YOU COULD ACTUALLY SEE THESE SHELLS COMING UP THEY SEEMED TO COME UP SO SLOWLY IT WAS A FASCINATING SIGHT YOU NEVER SEE ANYTHING LIKE IT AGAIN
YOU1000000136_S0000302	WITHIN A MINUTE THE REST OF JUPITER'S DEFENSES OPENED UP ON THE ADVANCING BOMBERS
YOU1000000136_S0000304	MY COMBAT STATION WAS THE ANTI AIR GUN
YOU1000000136_S0000305	YOU HAVE TO TAKE YOUR HAT OFF TO THE GERMAN GUNNERS THEY'D GOT THE ALTITUDE ABSOLUTELY COCK ON I MEAN WE WERE FIFTEEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FEET AND THE FLAG WAS BURSTING EXACTLY AT THAT LEVEL
YOU1000000136_S0000306	BUT WE WERE FORTUNATE THAT THEY WERE A LITTLE BIT EARLY THE FLAT WAS IN FRONT OF US BY A MATTER OF A FEW YARDS
YOU1000000136_S0000307	WHEN THE FUEL IN A TWO HUNDRED GALLON TANK IS USED UP THAT'S WHEN IT BECOMES DANGEROUS BECAUSE SHOULD A BIT OF FLAT GET THROUGH IT'S GOING TO HIT SORT OF VAPORIZED FUEL
YOU1000000136_S0000308	HOW DO YOU FEEL I MUST ADMIT YOU'RE A BIT EXCITED AND THINK CHRIST HOPE THEY DON'T HIT US
YOU1000000136_S0000309	I HAD TO GET THAT AEROPLANE POSITIONED SO THE BOMB WENT DOWN TO HIT THIS TARGET WHICH FROM FIFTEEN THOUSAND FEET MUST HAVE LOOKED TO MY BOMB LIKE A DINKY TO EVEN THOUGH IT WAS NINE HUNDRED FEET LONG
YOU1000000136_S0000311	THE FIRST TALL BOY WAS RELEASED AT EIGHT FORTY ONE IT'S CALLED A DIRECT HIT
YOU1000000136_S0000313	THE NEXT FIVE RECORDED ANOTHER DIRECT HIT THREE NEAR MISSES AND ASTRAY
YOU1000000136_S0000315	YEAH YOU COULD SEE IT GO DOWN LIKE A DART ALMOST BECAUSE IT WAS PAINTED BRIGHT GREEN YEAH AND IT LOOKED QUITE NICE ACTUALLY DIVING DOWN THERE
YOU1000000136_S0000316	WENT THROUGH THE SPEED OF SOUND SO WHAT THESE POOR SAILORS FELT WHEN ONE OR TWO OF THEM LANDED WHEN THE MACHINE COME ARE COMING AGAINST YOU YOU HAVE
YOU1000000136_S0000317	YOU CANNOT GET AIR ENOUGH IT'S SO AS ONE PRESSED YOUR YOUR AIR
YOU1000000136_S0000319	AFTER THE FIRST WAVE OF SIX BOMBERS TONY IVERSON WAS IN THE SECOND WAVE OF THREE HE ATTACKED AT EIGHT FORTY TWO
YOU1000000136_S0000320	I BOMBED AT NUMBER SEVEN OR NUMBER EIGHT AND I THINK I HAD A NEAR MISS OR NOT NEAR MISS I'M NOT SURE I'VE NEVER I CAN'T GO FURTHER THAN THAT
YOU1000000136_S0000322	THIS SECOND WAVE SCORED TWO VERY NEAR MISSES THE BOMBS WERE BEGINNING TO OVERWHELM THE SHIP
YOU1000000136_S0000324	THE FIRST BOMB HAD LANDED AMIDSHIPS IT LED TO ONE OF THE MAGAZINES BLOWING UP BOMB FOUR HAD HIT CLOSE TO A TURRET AND BLEW IT INTO THE AIR BOMBS FIVE SEVEN NINE AND FOURTEEN
YOU1000000136_S0000325	HAD LANDED CLOSE BY THESE ALSO HAD A DEVASTATING EFFECT PRODUCING SHOCK WAVES THAT BUCKLED THE SHIP'S FRAME AND CAUSED IT TO START TO CAPSIZE
YOU1000000136_S0000327	THE FIRST NINE AIRCRAFT BOMBED IN ONE AND A HALF MINUTES THAT'S NINETY SECONDS YOU CAN COUNT NINETY SECONDS JUST THINK OF NINE FIVE TON BOMBS COMING DOWN AT YOU
YOU1000000136_S0000329	NINE SQUADRON FOLLOWED UP DROPPING THEIR TALL BOYS INTO THE SMOKE AS THEY EXPLODED FEW WERE CERTAIN OF THE OUTCOME
YOU1000000136_S0000331	THERE WAS SMOKE UP AT THE ONE END AS IT HAD BEEN THE POINT I THINK
YOU1000000136_S0000332	BUT THE RIGGAN WAS QUITE CONVINCED NAUGHTY THINGS GOING OVER IT
YOU1000000136_S0000334	AS THE LANCASTERS TURNED AWAY FROM THE TARGET THEY KNEW THE DANGER WASN'T OVER YET
YOU1000000136_S0000336	WE REALIZED WE HADN'T SEEN ANY FIGHTERS WHICH IS
YOU1000000136_S0000338	AMAZING AMAZING LUCK
YOU1000000136_S0000340	THEY WERE LUCKIER THAN THEY COULD HAVE IMAGINED THE FIRST GERMAN FIGHTERS WERE LESS THAN THREE MINUTES AWAY AS THE LAST BOMB WAS DROPPED
YOU1000000136_S0000342	IT TOOK ME APPROXIMATELY TEN MINUTES TO GET THOSE FROM BARDUFOSS AND WHEN I ARRIVED THERE THE TURBAS WAS ALREADY TURNING OVER
YOU1000000136_S0000344	SO I TURNED AROUND AND FLEW BACK THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO
YOU1000000136_S0000346	KURT HAD ONLY JUST MISSED THE DEFENSELESS LANCASTERS ALL THE CREWS RETURNED HOME SAFELY WAS IT LUCK OR WERE THERE OTHER FORCES AT WORK
YOU1000000136_S0000348	THE SINKING OF THE BATTLESHIP TURPITZ AFTER THIRTY THREE FAILED ATTEMPTS WAS A REMARKABLE FEAT OF NAVIGATION FLYING AND PRECISION BOMBING BUT IT HAD A TERRIBLE HUMAN COST
YOU1000000136_S0000350	SEVENTEEN HUNDRED SAILORS WERE ON BOARD AS THE SHIP BEGAN TO CAPSIZE
YOU1000000136_S0000352	I SAW NOT THE EXPLOSION FROM THE HIT ON THE SHIP BUT I FEEL THE QUAKE YOU ARE FEELING THAT THE SHIP MAKE A JUMP FROM HALF METER
YOU1000000136_S0000353	AND IN THE NEXT MOMENT THE SHIP BEGAN TO CAPSIZE IT GOES SO AND SO AND AND AT LAST WERE HANGING IN THE RAINING HERE
YOU1000000136_S0000354	AND I GO A MOMENT LATER INTO THE WATER YES AND THEN I SWIM TO THE COASTLINE AND THE WATER WAS OIL AND
YOU1000000136_S0000356	MANY OF THE
YOU1000000136_S0000358	THEY HAVE THEIR FACE IN THE WATER THEY DID AND IT LOOKS I WAS CRAZY IT LOOKS AS AS WHEN
YOU1000000136_S0000359	FOOTBALLS WERE SWIMMING IN THE WATER CRAZY SIGHT
YOU1000000136_S0000361	VILE BARTLING WAS BELOW DECKS WHEN THE SHIP CAPSIZED
YOU1000000136_S0000363	TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD KARL HEINZ KESLING WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE ON SHORE AT THE TIME OF THE ATTACK
YOU1000000136_S0000365	HE RUSHED TO THE RESCUE OF THE HUNDREDS OF SAILORS TRAPPED INSIDE THE HULL
YOU1000000136_S0000367	AS THE TIDE ROSE THE COMPARTMENTS BEGAN TO FILL WITH WATER THE RESCUERS COULD HEAR THEIR ENTOMBED COMRADES SINGING OHLAND BAALIS UNTIL THE VOICES FELL SILENT
YOU1000000136_S0000369	NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE SAILORS LOST THEIR LIVES BUT THE BEAST HAD BEEN SLAIN
YOU1000000136_S0000371	LOOKING BACK IT'S QUITE REMARKABLE THAT THE RAIDERS MANAGED TO GET AWAY WITH IT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT IT'S THE DEFENDERS WHO ACTUALLY GOT THE ODDS
YOU1000000136_S0000372	STACKED IN THEIR FAVOUR YOU'VE GOT A SQUADRON OF CRACK FIGHTERS BASED NEARBY
YOU1000000136_S0000374	APPARENTLY WITH THE SPECIFIC JOB OF LOOKING AFTER THE TURPS YOU'VE GOT THE RADAR SYSTEMS APPARENTLY POINTING INWARDS YET THERE WE ARE AT THE END OF THAT MORNING THE TURRETS IS SUNK
YOU1000000136_S0000375	AND THE ATTACKERS HAVE GOT AWAY WITH IT VIRTUALLY SCOT FREE NOW MAYBE IT WAS JUST SHEER GOOD LUCK BUT I'VE OFTEN THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS THERE'S ANOTHER EXPLANATION FOR WHAT HAPPENED
YOU1000000136_S0000377	ON THE ISLAND OF VANDA PATRICK IS FOLLOWING A NEW LEAD THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN WHY THE GERMAN FIGHTERS WEREN'T SCRAMBLED IN TIME
YOU1000000136_S0000379	HE'S MEETING LOCAL RESIDENT JOURNALIST SANDER PETERSON AS A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD BOY SCHOOLBOY SANDER WORKED IN THE END RADAR BASE FOR A GERMAN OFFICER LIEUTENANT CARL HEINRICH VESNA
YOU1000000136_S0000381	VESNA WAS A KEY LINK IN THE RADAR COMMUNICATION NETWORK ON THE ISLAND PETERSON THINKS VESNA COULD HAVE DELAYED VITAL INFORMATION TO THE FIGHTER SQUADRON AT BARDUFOSS
YOU1000000136_S0000383	WE UNDERSTAND THAT RESNER HAD SYMPATHY FOR ENGLAND
YOU1000000136_S0000384	HOW DID HE LET YOU KNOW THAT THAT HE WAS IN SYMPATHY WITH GERMANY'S ENEMIES
YOU1000000136_S0000385	YOU SPEAK VERY
YOU1000000136_S0000387	THAT'S LIKE A CIGARETTE CASE
YOU1000000136_S0000389	INSIDE THE
YOU1000000136_S0000391	VESNA WAS IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME BUT WAS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR DELAYING VITAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE RAID

YOU1000000137_S0000233	ARCHITECTURE GARDENS AND SCULPTURES WERE DESIGNED AS COMPLETE ARTISTIC ENSEMBLES THE AIM WAS TO PLEASE THE EYE AND PLEASE THE PEOPLE NOT PRAISE GOD
YOU1000000137_S0000235	MEDIEVAL ART WAS BASICALLY RELIGIOUS ART
YOU1000000137_S0000237	THAT'S IN PART EVIDENCED BY THE FACT THAT WE ONLY KNOW THE NAMES OF A HANDFUL OF THE ARTISTS
YOU1000000137_S0000239	ALTHOUGH IT WAS CUSTOMARY TO SIGN INDIVIDUAL WORKS WE OFTEN SPEAK OF THE MASTER OF SUCH AND SUCH WHOSE NAME WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IN THE RENAISSANCE IN THE RENAISSANCE WE SEE THE CREATORS OF WORKS BEING NAMED
YOU1000000137_S0000241	ART BECAME FREE FROM RELIGIOUS MOTIFS AND TURNED TOWARDS EVERYDAY LIFE
YOU1000000137_S0000243	IT ALSO DESCRIBED THAT EVERYDAY LIFE MORE ACCURATELY RESPECT THINK OF PERSPECTIVE PAINTING FOR EXAMPLE IN ART TRIED TO REFLECT EVERYDAY LIFE IN GREAT DETAIL BUT EXTREMELY SELF CONFIDENT ARTISTS STEPPED UP
YOU1000000137_S0000244	AND MADE THEIR DEMANDS CONFRONTING THE POWERFUL WHO IN TURN THEN COURTED THEM
YOU1000000137_S0000246	MICHELANGELO FOR EXAMPLE WHO WOULD EVEN DICTATE CERTAIN THINGS TO THE POPE
YOU1000000137_S0000248	IN THIRTEEN FORTY SEVEN THE BLACK DEATH BROKE OUT IN EUROPE
YOU1000000137_S0000250	BUBONIC PLAGUE KILLED ALMOST HALF THE ENGLISH POPULATION WITHIN JUST SEVEN MONTHS AND AT LEAST A THIRD OF THE POPULATION OF EUROPE IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS
YOU1000000137_S0000252	MILLIONS PERISHED
YOU1000000137_S0000254	IT WAS THE MOST HORRIFIC EPIDEMIC IN EUROPEAN HISTORY AND IT CHANGED EVERYTHING ULTIMATELY EVEN PEOPLE THEMSELVES
YOU1000000137_S0000256	IT MIGHT SOUND CYNICAL BUT THE PLAGUE DIDN'T JUST HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE CULTURE OF THE RENAISSANCE AND THE ARTS
YOU1000000137_S0000258	THE WEALTH OF THE DEAD WAS CONCENTRATED IN THE HANDS OF THE SURVIVORS
YOU1000000137_S0000260	AND THOSE WHO SURVIVED SAW LIFE WITH COMPLETELY DIFFERENT EYES
YOU1000000137_S0000262	SOME MUST HAVE SAID LET'S ENJOY OUR DAYS AND SPEND THEM IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE
YOU1000000137_S0000264	MAYBE THEY WANTED TO SURROUND THEMSELVES WITH BEAUTIFUL ART
YOU1000000137_S0000266	OTHERS WOULD HAVE WANTED TO SQUARE THEIR ACCOUNTS WITH GOD AND DO SOMETHING FOR THE WELL BEING OF THEIR SOULS YEAH LIKE COSMO DE MEDICI WHO BUILT AN ENTIRE CHURCH
YOU1000000137_S0000268	THE PLAGUE HAD A FUNDAMENTAL INFLUENCE ON PEOPLE'S ATTITUDE TO LIFE
YOU1000000137_S0000270	THE IMPERATIVE OF THE RENAISSANCE WAS LIVE THIS LIFE AND ENJOY IT
YOU1000000137_S0000271	RENAISSANCE ART WAS A COMPLETE DEPARTURE FROM THE ART OF THE MIDDLE AGES NEW BODIES EVERYWHERE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE ENMESHED IN IDYLLIC LANDSCAPES OPEN EROTICISM
YOU1000000137_S0000273	IN MICHELANGELO'S LAST JUDGMENT THE HEAVENLY HOST IS SHOWN NUDE IN GREAT ANATOMICAL DETAIL IT WAS A REVOLUTION
YOU1000000137_S0000275	THE PLAGUE RAVAGED FLORENCE ONLY A FIFTH OF THE CITY'S POPULATION SURVIVED THE BLACK DEATH
YOU1000000137_S0000277	IT ALSO CHANGED HOW WEALTH WAS DISTRIBUTED AND LED TO THE RISE OF A NEW ELITE TYCOONS WHO BECAME UNIMAGINABLY RICH
YOU1000000137_S0000279	FAMILIES LIKE THE MEDICI WERE MERCHANTS AND BANKERS PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN HELD IN CONTEMPT BY THE FEUDAL SOCIETY OF THE MIDDLE AGES NOW THEY WERE THE ONES IN CHARGE
YOU1000000137_S0000281	LET'S GO BACK TO THE YEAR FOURTEEN TWENTY FIVE AND THE SCULPTOR DONATELLO
YOU1000000137_S0000283	HIS PATRON COSIMO MEDICI WAS THE FIRST GREAT SPONSOR OF THE ARTS
YOU1000000137_S0000284	MEDICI WAS A WEALTHY BANKER AND A SHREWD STRATEGIST WHO EMPLOYED ALMOST MAFIA LIKE METHODS
YOU1000000137_S0000286	WAS ONE OF THE RICHEST MEN OF HIS DAY AND HIS MONEY FUELED THE DEVELOPMENT OF ART AND ARCHITECTURE IN FLORENCE
YOU1000000137_S0000288	IT PROVIDED THE SPARK THAT IGNITED THE ITALIAN RENAISSANCE
YOU1000000137_S0000290	BUT HIS SUCCESS WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT A SEEMINGLY MINOR INVENTION THAT REVOLUTIONIZED BANKING
YOU1000000137_S0000292	DOUBLE ENTRY BOOKKEEPING WAS A SIMPLE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT THAT INVOLVED KEEPING A CREDIT ACCOUNT SHOWING INCOME AND A DEBIT ACCOUNT WITH OUTGOING PAYMENTS
YOU1000000137_S0000293	THE FIRST COMPLETE DOUBLE ENTRY BOOKKEEPING SYSTEM CAN BE TRACED BACK TO THIRTEEN FORTY IN LEDGERS FROM GENOA SHOWING GOVERNMENT INCOME AND EXPENDITURE
YOU1000000137_S0000295	DOUBLE ENTRY BOOKKEEPING SHOWED ACCOUNT HOLDERS HOW MUCH CAPITAL THEY HAD ON HAND ALLOWING THEM GREATER OVERVIEW AND CONTROL OF THEIR FINANCES
YOU1000000137_S0000297	THE MEDICS WERE GLOBAL PLAYERS THEY ISSUED LOANS AND SIGNED SECURE CREDIT NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS THAT COULD BE CASHED IN MANY COUNTRIES THE PRECURSOR TO TODAY'S TRAVELLER'S CHECKS
YOU1000000137_S0000302	ON TAXES DONATIONS TO THE NEEDY ON BUILDINGS AND ON ART
YOU1000000137_S0000304	A HOST OF WRITERS SCHOLARS ARTISTS AND ARCHITECTS WERE DEPENDENT ON HIS MONEY AND THEY REPAID HIM IN BEAUTY
YOU1000000137_S0000306	THE MEDIC PALACE IS A GLORIOUS STAGE OF RENAISSANCE ART IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT COSIMO INSTRUCTED THE ARCHITECT NOT TO MAKE IT TOO MAGNIFICENT AS HE DIDN'T WANT TO ROUSE THE ENVY OF THE OTHER PATRICIAN FAMILIES
YOU1000000137_S0000308	THE MEDICS ALSO INVESTED IN THEIR SPIRITUAL WELL BEING THEY DONATED MONEY FOR A NEW CHURCH THE BASILICA DE SAN LORENZO
YOU1000000137_S0000310	COSMO DE MEDICI SUPPORTED ARTISTS CAREERS AND SPAWNED SOMETHING THAT HAD NOT EXISTED BEFORE THE CELEBRITY
YOU1000000137_S0000312	THIS CELEBRITY AROSE IN A SORT OF INTELLECTUAL HOTHOUSE IN A MARKET FULL OF COMPETITION WHERE HUMANISTS INTELLECTUALS CREATIVES AND ARTISTS OF ALL KINDS WERE SUPPORTED AND OFTEN VERY WELL PAID BY PATRONS
YOU1000000137_S0000314	THESE PATRONS IN TURN HOPED THESE ARTISTS WOULD BRING THEIR COURTS GREATER FAME AND STATUS
YOU1000000137_S0000316	PAINTERS AND SCULPTORS HYPERBOLE SOON BECAME JUST AS IMPORTANT AS SKILL
YOU1000000137_S0000318	IN THIS VERY COMPETITIVE ARENA THEY ACQUIRED FAME AND STATUS AND WE STILL KNOW THEIR NAMES TODAY
YOU1000000137_S0000320	THAT ALSO MEANS THE UNRECOGNIZED ARTIST THE SUFFERING GENIUS WAS A PARTICULARLY FREQUENT PHENOMENON STATE STATE
YOU1000000137_S0000322	DONATELLO WAS ONE OF THE FIRST GREAT CELEBRITY ARTISTS OF THE RENAISSANCE
YOU1000000137_S0000324	HE WAS ALMOST SIXTY WHEN HE CAME TO COSMO DE MEDICI WITH DESIGNS FOR HIS STATUE OF DAVID THE BOY WHO DEFEATED GOLIATH
YOU1000000137_S0000326	THIS HIS MOST SIGNIFICANT WORK WAS ALSO A BRAVE ONE BECAUSE DONATELLO DAVID WAS NAKED
YOU1000000137_S0000328	JUST A FEW GENERATIONS EARLIER ANCIENT STATUES WERE DESTROYED FOR SHOWING NUDITY
YOU1000000137_S0000330	BOTH MEDICI AND DONATELLO WERE CERTAINLY AWARE OF HOW REVOLUTIONARY IT WAS
YOU1000000137_S0000331	DONATELLO DAVID WAS THE FIRST LIFE SIZED SCULPTURE OF A NUDE SINCE ANTIQUITY
YOU1000000137_S0000333	UNLIKE OTHER CULTURES THE RENAISSANCE DIDN'T WORRY ABOUT DEPICTING NAKED OR SEMI NAKED BODIES AND THAT WAS VERY SIGNIFICANT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF MEDICINE
YOU1000000137_S0000335	YOU CAN'T STUDY ANATOMY IF YOU CAN'T DEPICT NAKED BODIES
YOU1000000137_S0000337	THAT WAS CRUCIAL TO A DIFFERENT WAY OF LOOKING AT PEOPLE
YOU1000000137_S0000339	A PERSON WASN'T JUST ANIMATED BY THE SPIRITS AND GUIDED BY THE STARS
YOU1000000137_S0000341	HE WAS A MECHANICALLY FUNCTIONING MACHINE AN ORGANISM
YOU1000000137_S0000343	WHAT WAS ALSO UNUSUAL WAS HIS INTERPRETATION
YOU1000000137_S0000345	DON TELLS DAVID IS NOT A MUSCULAR ADULT BUT A YOUTH WITH A RATHER FEMININE APPEARANCE
YOU1000000137_S0000347	AND HE IS FASCINATINGLY LIFELIKE BUT WHERE DID DONATELLO GET HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE HUMAN BODY
YOU1000000137_S0000349	WITH THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE EARLY RENAISSANCE FOR ALL THINGS CLASSICAL INTEREST IN ANATOMY WAS GROWING AS WELL
YOU1000000137_S0000351	ALMOST ALL THE ARTISTS SCULPTORS AND PAINTERS OF THE RENAISSANCE WOULD HAVE STUDIED HUMAN ANATOMY IF ONLY FROM BOOKS AND DRAWINGS
YOU1000000137_S0000353	THERE WAS A FLOURISHING TRADE IN FRESH CORPSES IT WAS ILLEGAL IN MANY PLACES AND PUNISHMENT FOR THIS CRIME WAS OFTEN DRACONIAN BUT CURIOSITY OFTEN TRIUMPHED OVER FEAR
YOU1000000137_S0000355	DENATALE QUITE POSSIBLY DISSECTED CORPSES TOO AS DID ALBRECHT DURER MICHELANGELO AND LEONARDO DA VINCI ONE OR TWO GENERATIONS LATER
YOU1000000137_S0000357	BUT EVEN IN DONATELLO TIME IN THE EARLY RENAISSANCE ARTISTS WERE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE STRUCTURE OF THE HUMAN BODY WHICH ALLOWED THEM TO CREATE NEW VERY LIFELIKE DEPICTIONS OF PEOPLE
YOU1000000137_S0000359	MEN LIKE DONATELLO WERE EITHER ARTISTICALLY TALENTED SCHOLARS OR SCHOLARLY ARTISTS
YOU1000000137_S0000361	AS FATE WOULD HAVE IT DONATES INTERPRETATION OF THE OLD TESTAMENT HERO DIDN'T ACHIEVE THE SAME POPULARITY AS ANOTHER SCULPTURE OF THE RENAISSANCE ONE THAT WAS ALSO CREATED IN FLORENCE
YOU1000000137_S0000363	AT FIVE METERS TALL MICHELANGELO'S DAVID IS A MONUMENTAL STATUE
YOU1000000137_S0000365	HALF A CENTURY AFTER DONATELLO IT SYMBOLIZED THE SELF CONFIDENCE OF THE NEW RENAISSANCE MAN
YOU1000000137_S0000369	THE EXPLOSIVE THING ABOUT THE RENAISSANCE WAS THAT PEOPLE BECAME AWARE OF THEIR ABILITIES AND STRENGTHS IN A NEW WAY
YOU1000000137_S0000371	THEY UNLEASHED AN INCREDIBLE ENERGY IN THEIR THINKING AND ACTIONS IN BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY
YOU1000000137_S0000373	THERE WAS AN OUTPOURING OF SELF CONFIDENCE
YOU1000000137_S0000375	IN THE MIDDLE AGES NEARLY EVERYONE WAS ILLITERATE THE FEW WHO COULD READ AND WRITE WERE FROM WEALTHIER FAMILIES OR MEN AND WOMEN OF THE CHURCH
YOU1000000137_S0000377	THE PEOPLE WHO MADE OR OWNED BOOKS LOOKED AFTER THEM LIKE TREASURES
YOU1000000137_S0000379	A COPYIST MIGHT ONLY PRODUCE TEN TO FIFTEEN VOLUMES IN AN ENTIRE LIFETIME WHICH MADE THE BOOKS INCREDIBLY VALUABLE
YOU1000000137_S0000381	BUT THAT WAS ABOUT TO CHANGE
YOU1000000137_S0000383	TO OBTAIN A LOVELY CODEX SUCH AS A BIBLE FOR EXAMPLE YOU WOULD HAVE TO SLAUGHTER AN ENTIRE FLOCK OF SHEEP AND THAT WAS EXPENSIVE
YOU1000000137_S0000385	BUT SUDDENLY BOOKS COULD BE HAD FOR LITTLE MONEY AND READING BECAME DEMOCRATIC
YOU1000000137_S0000387	KNOWLEDGE BECAME ACCESSIBLE TO LARGER NUMBERS OF PEOPLE
YOU1000000137_S0000389	MORE AND MORE PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN SCHOLARLY DISCUSSIONS ABOUT NEW IDEAS
YOU1000000137_S0000391	THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN EXPLAIN HOW EUROPE BECAME THE CONTINENT OF INNOVATION MORE SO THAN ANY OTHER
YOU1000000137_S0000393	THE SCRIBES OF THE CHURCH HADN'T JUST COPIED WORKS THEY HAD ALSO CHANGED THEM AND FALSIFIED SOURCES CLAIMING THEIR INTERPRETATION AS THE WORD OF GOD
YOU1000000137_S0000395	THAT GAVE THEM GREAT POWER
YOU1000000137_S0000397	BUT THE RENAISSANCE BROKE THEIR MONOPOLY ON KNOWLEDGE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT BASTIONS OF THE CHURCH
YOU1000000137_S0000399	AN AWARENESS OF SOURCES AND THE TRUTH GREW NOT LEAST BECAUSE THE SOURCES WERE NOW ACCESSIBLE AND PEOPLE STARTED ANALYZING THEM USING CLASSICAL TECHNIQUES TECHNIQUES USED IN ANTIQUITY
YOU1000000137_S0000401	THE TRADITIONAL MYTHS PROPAGATED BY THE CHURCH SIMPLY WEREN'T ACCEPTED ANYMORE
YOU1000000137_S0000403	IN FOURTEEN FIFTY PRINTER JOHANNES GUTENBERG'S INVENTION MAY HAVE BEEN THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ONE IN A THOUSAND YEARS AND YET WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE
YOU1000000137_S0000405	HIS ACHIEVEMENT WAS TO COMBINE EXISTING METHODS OF REPRODUCTION AND PRINTING INTO A SINGLE SYSTEM
YOU1000000137_S0000407	THE HANDHELD CAST WAS THE KEY TO HIS PRINTING PRESS
YOU1000000137_S0000409	IT ALLOWED LETTERS TO BE CAST INDIVIDUALLY MORE QUICKLY AND WITH GREATER PRECISION
YOU1000000137_S0000411	THIS MARKED THE INVENTION OF MODERN PRINTING
YOU1000000137_S0000413	IT WAS ALSO THE DAWN OF MASS COMMUNICATION
YOU1000000137_S0000415	INFORMATION BECAME MORE WIDELY AVAILABLE OPENING THE DOOR TO NEW OPINIONS AND PERSPECTIVES
YOU1000000137_S0000417	INFORMATION ALSO BECAME VALUED IN NEW WAYS AS THE PRINTED WORD TOOK PRECEDENCE OVER ORAL TRADITION
YOU1000000137_S0000419	PRINTING WAS OF TRULY ENORMOUS SIGNIFICANCE AND GUTENBERG IS THE PERSON WHO DID THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN A THOUSAND YEARS OF WORLD HISTORY MY READING BECAME INCREASINGLY WIDESPREAD
YOU1000000137_S0000420	IN THE GREAT SCIENTIFIC INNOVATIONS AND THE GREAT RELIGIOUS REVOLUTION THE REFORMATION WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT PRINTING
YOU1000000137_S0000422	THE FIRST SIXTY YEARS AFTER THE INVENTION OF PRINTING SAW THE PUBLICATION OF FOUR HUNDRED DIFFERENT VERNACULAR EDITIONS OF THE BIBLE
YOU1000000137_S0000424	AT THE SAME TIME THE NUMBER OF LAY PEOPLE WHO COULD READ AND WRITE GREW
YOU1000000137_S0000426	MORE AND MORE PEOPLE NOW HAD DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO BIBLICAL TEXTS TO THE WORD OF GOD
YOU1000000137_S0000429	THE PEOPLE OF THE RENAISSANCE FELT CLOSE TO GOD THEY FELT THEY WERE BECOMING GODLIKE THEMSELVES THEY WOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT IN THE MIDDLE AGES IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED BLASPHEMOUS PEOPLE REFERRED TO THE BIBLE AND CALLED THEMSELVES GOD'S CREATIONS
YOU1000000137_S0000430	GOD MADE US IN HIS IMAGE WE'RE ALMOST GODS IN MINIATURE GOD CAME CLOSER TO PEOPLE IN THE RENAISSANCE THAN HE EVER WAS IN THE MIDDLE AGES
YOU1000000137_S0000432	BUT IT WASN'T BOOKS THAT MADE UP THE BULK OF THE PRINTING SHOPS BUSINESS IT WAS FLY SHEETS AND PAMPHLETS
YOU1000000137_S0000434	THEY WERE AFFORDABLE AND COST A LABOURER TWO OR THREE HOURS PAY
YOU1000000137_S0000436	NOW EVEN ORDINARY PEOPLE COULD PRINT A PAMPHLET AND DISSEMINATE THEIR OPINIONS VERSES AND DRAWINGS
YOU1000000137_S0000438	THREE SUBJECTS DOMINATED SENSATIONS AND MIRACLES RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION AND POLITICAL AND MILITARY PROPAGANDA
YOU1000000137_S0000440	ILLUSTRATED FLY SHEETS ALSO CARRIED THE FIRST CARICATURES
YOU1000000137_S0000442	THERE COULD BE AN INVITATION AN OPINION OR A WARNING
YOU1000000137_S0000444	JUST LIKE TODAY'S SOCIAL MEDIA NETWORKS THEY SERVED AS A VEHICLE FOR THE MASS DISSEMINATION OF OPINION
YOU1000000137_S0000446	THE RENAISSANCE HAD FLY SHEETS IT HAD LITERATURE THAT WAS PRINTED AND SPREAD VERY QUICKLY IT COULD BE PRINTED IN NERENBERG TOMORROW AND IN TWO DAYS TIME WOULD BE IN ZURICH
YOU1000000137_S0000448	INFORMATION DISSEMINATED MORE QUICKLY AND WAS MUCH HARDER TO CONTROL TOO
YOU1000000137_S0000450	CENSORSHIP OF THE CHURCH THAT DICTATED WHAT WAS RIGHT DIDN'T WORK ANYMORE ONCE THE FLY SHEETS BEGAN CIRCULATING
YOU1000000137_S0000452	YOU CAN ONLY UNDERSTAND THE HUGE BOOM IN FREE THINKING IN THE RENAISSANCE IF YOU LOOK AT THE MEDIA AND THE FLY SHEETS IN PARTICULAR
YOU1000000137_S0000454	MASS COMMUNICATION HELPED CREATE THAT NEW TYPE OF INDIVIDUAL THE CELEBRITY
YOU1000000137_S0000456	GIORGIO VASARI WHO HAD PAINTED THE FRESCOES AND THE FLORENCE CATHEDRAL DOME WAS ALSO A BIOGRAPHER OF THE MOST DAZZLING PERSONALITIES OF HIS TIME THE ARTIST
YOU1000000137_S0000458	VASARI ALSO PRODUCED PORTRAITS OF RAPHAEL AND MICHELANGELO BUT HE WAS PARTICULARLY TAKEN WITH LEONARDO DA VINCI LEONARDO WAS UNCONVENTIONAL AND WASN'T AFRAID TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIS HOMOSEXUALITY
YOU1000000137_S0000460	HE WAS REMARKABLY CREATIVE AND TALENTED BUT ALSO RATHER VAIN
YOU1000000137_S0000462	VASARI WAS THE FIRST TO COIN THE TERM ANCHETA RENAISSANCE
YOU1000000137_S0000464	ENDOWED HIS SUBJECTS WITH THE OURA THAT MADE THEM STARS THE SHINING LIGHTS OF SOCIETY
YOU1000000137_S0000466	HE CREATED AN IMAGE OF THE ARTIST THAT HADN'T EXISTED BEFORE
YOU1000000137_S0000468	MOST ARTISTS WERE CRAFTSMEN
YOU1000000137_S0000470	THAT'S HOW THEY SAW THEMSELVES AND THAT'S HOW OTHERS SAW HER BUT VASARI CREATED THE IMAGE OF THE GENIUS THE STRANGE CRAZY MAN THE ARTIST ENTHRALLED TO IDEAS
YOU1000000137_S0000471	HE PAINTED A PICTURE OF AN ARTIST THAT SEEMS STRANGELY FAMILIAR TODAY IN FACT HE CREATED THE MODERN ARTIST
YOU1000000137_S0000473	PAINTER HOLBEIN WAS THE FIRST TO PAINT A PORTRAIT OF HIS FAMILY
YOU1000000137_S0000475	PAINTERS BOTTICELLI AND DO EVEN PAINTED THEMSELVES THE SELF PORTRAIT BECAME THE EXPRESSION OF A NEW SELF CONFIDENCE
YOU1000000137_S0000477	AND THEN FINALLY RAPHAEL AND TISON THE FIRST PAINTERS TO SIGN THEIR PAINTINGS A FURTHER STEP TOWARDS CELEBRITY THE GREAT NAMES IN ART SUDDENLY BECAME WORLD FAMOUS A HUNDRED YEARS EARLIER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNTHINKABLE
YOU1000000137_S0000479	THE TOWERING FIGURES OF RENAISSANCE ART FIRST AND FOREMOST LEONARDO DA VINCI AND MICHELANGELO WERE FATED INVITED TO COURT AND PAID HANDSOMELY
YOU1000000137_S0000481	THIRTEEN HUNDRED VENETIAN GLASS BLOWERS INVENTED THE CONVEX MIRROR ITS IMPORTANCE IS WIDELY UNDERESTIMATED BUT COMPARED WITH WHAT HAD COME BEFORE ITS REFLECTION WAS BRIGHT AND ALMOST FREE OF DISTORTION
YOU1000000137_S0000483	MOST PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE AGES HAD ONLY SEEN THEIR FACES AS BLURRY REFLECTIONS IN WATER
YOU1000000137_S0000485	THE GLASS MIRROR MEANT PEOPLE COULD REALLY SEE THEMSELVES CLEARLY FOR THE FIRST TIME
YOU1000000137_S0000487	MAYBE THAT'S WHY THEY WERE MORE SELF CONFIDENT THAN THEIR MEDIEVAL ANCESTORS
YOU1000000137_S0000489	SELF CONFIDENCE AND PRIDE IN PERSONAL ACHIEVEMENTS WERE NO LONGER SEEN AS SINFUL
YOU1000000137_S0000491	HUMILITY WAS OUT OF STEP WITH THE TIMES
YOU1000000137_S0000493	A PERSON WHO HELD HIS HEAD HIGH AND WALKED TALL IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD WHO SAW REASON AS HIS SPECIAL GIFT FROM GOD THOSE WERE THE NEW VALUES
YOU1000000137_S0000495	AS A RESULT HUMILITY BECAME LESS IMPORTANT THAN AS HUMANS WE'RE CAPABLE AND GOD WANTS US TO USE OUR GIFTS IN THE WORLD
YOU1000000137_S0000497	WHAT WAS THE SECRET OF THE GREAT RENAISSANCE ARTISTS THIS IMMENSE FLOURISHING OF CREATIVITY REMAINS A MYSTERY BUT THEIR CHARISMA ENDURES TO THIS DAY
YOU1000000138_S0000001	LAST YEAR WAS THE DEADLIEST YEAR ON RECORD FOR MEXICO
YOU1000000138_S0000003	DRUG RELATED VIOLENCE HAS INFILTRATED ALL PARTS OF SOCIETY AND ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY IT'S AFFECTING EVERYONE AND IT IS ABSOLUTELY EVERYWHERE
YOU1000000138_S0000005	ACAPULCO WAS SOMEWHERE AT THE CENTER OF SOME OF THE WORST VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY
YOU1000000138_S0000007	OUR STORY WAS THE INFLUENCE OF THE CRIME GANGS HOW THEIR THEIR TENTACLES HAVE SPREAD OUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND ACAPULCO IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF IT AND SO WE ASKED THE POLICE IF WE CAN GO ALONG ON A POLICE PATROL
YOU1000000138_S0000009	WELL THE CIA'S LATEST TRAVEL ADVISORIES FOR A NUMBER OF AREAS IN MEXICO BUT PARTICULARLY HERE IS DON'T EVEN BOTHER GOING IF YOU'RE A TOURIST REASON FOR THAT THEY SAY IS THAT THE MURDER RATE DANGER LEVELS ARE SO HIGH THEY'RE ACTUALLY COMPARABLE TO IRAQ
YOU1000000138_S0000010	AND SYRIA AND INDEED HERE IN ONE MONTH LAST YEAR OVER TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE MURDERED IN THESE DRUG WARS
YOU1000000138_S0000012	ON THIS PATROL WE ARRIVED AT A VILLAGE SMALL TOWN AND IT WAS A
YOU1000000138_S0000014	BIZARRE EXPERIENCE
YOU1000000138_S0000016	WE CAME ACROSS A CRIME SCENE WHERE LESS THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS PREVIOUSLY EIGHT PEOPLE HAD BEEN KILLED

YOU1000000138_S0000043	SOMETHING LITTLE NEXT DAY NO ONE REMEMBERS
YOU1000000138_S0000045	WE THEN DECIDED TO TRY AND GET TO ACTUALLY THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE THE STUFF THAT FUELS ALL OF THE PROBLEMS
YOU1000000138_S0000047	WE WERE TAKEN UP INTO THE MOUNTAINS TO A MODEST HOUSE WITH A BIG FRONT PORCH AND THERE WE WERE INTRODUCED TO A GUY WHO IS CLEARLY IN CHARGE HE SAID FARMERS UNION I MEAN IT'S OPEN TO INTERPRETATION
YOU1000000138_S0000049	WE DIDN'T JUST ARRIVED THIS HAS BEEN WORKED ON FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME CONTACTS HAVE TO BE MADE

YOU1000000138_S0000053	JUST PUTTING OURSELVES IN A REALLY STUPID SITUATION WHERE THEY CAN KILL US
YOU1000000138_S0000055	THESE GUYS DON'T SEE THEMSELVES AS GANGSTERS THEY ACTUALLY JUST SEE THEMSELVES AS BUSINESSMEN AND FARMERS
YOU1000000138_S0000057	THE GUY IN CHARGE WOULDN'T ADMIT TO FARMING OPIUM BUT HE DID SAY HE FARMED WHAT HE FARMED TO SURVIVE
YOU1000000138_S0000059	ONE OF THE FIRST TALES HE TOLD US WHEN WE STARTED TALKING TO HIM WAS ABOUT HOW HE HAD BEEN ARRESTED BUT THIS WASN'T AN ORDINARY ARREST THREE BLACK HAWK HELICOPTERS HAD TURNED UP THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN FOR JUST ANYBODY
YOU1000000138_S0000063	THEY MAY LOOK VERY NORMAL BUT THEY ARE INVOLVED IN A VERY VERY DANGEROUS BUSINESS IN MANY WAYS THEY WERE A BIT LIKE THE MEXICAN SOPRANOS IF YOU LIKE
YOU1000000138_S0000065	HE WAS VERY AFFABLE BUT THERE WAS NO FORGETTING THAT THIS IS A SERIOUS CHARACTER AND THAT THIS WAS ESSENTIALLY AN INTERVIEW BUT WE WERE THE ONES BEING INTERVIEWED
YOU1000000138_S0000067	I'VE BEEN HAVING LUNCH WITH MANY OF THESE FARMERS AND THEY ARE JUST REALLY LOVELY AND NICE PEOPLE THEY HAD TO KILL YOU THEY KILL YOU BUT NOW THEY'RE GOOD FRIENDS TO EACH OTHER
YOU1000000138_S0000069	HE MADE THE PHONE CALL AND WE WERE ALLOWED TO GO UP INTO THE JUNGLE WHERE WE MET BY SECURITY GUYS CARRYING MACHINE GUNS FULLY KITTED OUT WITH THEIR FACES WITH BANDANAS
YOU1000000138_S0000071	THEY TOOK US TO THE POCKET
YOU1000000138_S0000073	AFTER ABOUT HALF AN HOUR OF REALLY ROUGH TERRAIN
YOU1000000138_S0000075	WE ARRIVED INTO THIS OPENING IT LOOKED LIKE THE MIDDLE OF THE FOREST HAD JUST BEEN COMPLETELY OPENED UP SO THAT THEY COULD GROW THE POPPIES
YOU1000000138_S0000077	SO THIS IS THE POPPY OIL THAT BECOMES OPIUM AND EVENTUALLY THAT BECOMES
YOU1000000138_S0000079	YEAH AND ALL THIS FIELD HAVING THIS
YOU1000000138_S0000081	WEATHER'S PERFECT FOR IT AND IT JUST KEEPS PRODUCING SO IT'S A BRILLIANT CROP WHY WOULDN'T THE DEMAND IS SO HIGH AND AS LONG AS THE DEMAND IS HIGH AND WE KNOW THE BIGGEST USER IS THE UNITED STATES THEN IT'S GOING TO KEEP BEING MADE
YOU1000000138_S0000083	THEY KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ASK THEM YOU KNOW THAT WITH THIS THEY CREATE
YOU1000000138_S0000085	YES AND YOU KNOW THAT THAT CREATES LOTS OF PROBLEMS
YOU1000000138_S0000086	YES BUT
YOU1000000138_S0000088	IF THEY DEMAND IS AVOCADO WE GROW AVOCADO
YOU1000000138_S0000089	IT SEEMS INTERESTING THAT WHAT HAPPENS HERE AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS SAY IN ACAPULCO THEY'RE LINKED BUT NOBODY THINKS ABOUT IT RIGHT
YOU1000000138_S0000090	THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO WE DON'T HAVE NO OTHER OPTION
YOU1000000138_S0000092	I REMEMBER ONE FARMER TELLING ME YEAH I KNOW THAT THIS IS POISON BUT IF I DON'T CREATE THIS POISON MY FAMILY IS GOING TO DIE
YOU1000000138_S0000094	SPEAKING TO THEM IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR THAT THEY CONSIDERED THERE WAS A REAL THREAT FROM RIVAL GANGS COMING IN TO TAKE THEIR CROP
YOU1000000138_S0000095	IF WE DON'T HAVE A GUN TO PROTECT US THEY WOULD KILL US
YOU1000000138_S0000097	NOBODY REALLY KNOWS HOW MUCH MONEY IS MADE BY THE DRUG CARTELS BUT IT IS BILLIONS AND BILLIONS AND BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
YOU1000000138_S0000099	IT'S NATIONWIDE IT'S ABSOLUTELY EVERY CITY EVERY TOWN EVERY VILLAGE IN VARYING LEVELS
YOU1000000138_S0000101	EITHER INVOLVEMENT IN THE DRUGS OR INVOLVEMENT IN CRIME THAT IS ACTUALLY PERPETUATED BY THIS WHOLE SOCIETY WHERE CRIMINALITY IS COMPLETELY NORMAL
YOU1000000138_S0000103	WE WENT TO MEET A GUY WHO'S A HITMAN
YOU1000000138_S0000105	HE EXPLAINED TO US IN IN DETAIL THE HITS THAT HE'S CARRYING OUT
YOU1000000138_S0000107	YOU HAVE BUSINESS RIVALS NOW NOT CARTELS HIRING THIS GUY TO TAKE OUT RIVALS
YOU1000000138_S0000109	IF I NEED TO FIX SOMETHING IN MY BUSINESS AND I THINK THAT MY PARTNER IS STEALING PART OF MY MONEY I JUST CALL THIS GUY
YOU1000000138_S0000111	THE BUSINESSMEN HE'S WORKING FOR AND BUSINESS WOMEN AS HE WAS KEEN TO POINT OUT WILL ACTUALLY ASK FOR REALLY HORRIBLE THINGS HANDS CUT OFF HEADS CUT OFF
YOU1000000138_S0000112	IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT LEVEL OF SCALE VIOLENCE
YOU1000000138_S0000114	HE INTERESTINGLY SAW ABSOLUTELY NO REASON TO FEEL ANY TYPE OF REMORSE AND ALTHOUGH HE'S QUITE PLEASANT AND HE'S PLEASANT TO US HE'S A VERY VERY DANGEROUS INDIVIDUAL
YOU1000000138_S0000116	VIOLENCE THROUGHOUT THIS SOCIETY HAS BECOME THE NORM
YOU1000000138_S0000118	IT REALLY IS A MESS AND EVERYBODY WE SPEAK TO DOESN'T SEE AN END TO IT IN FACT THEY SEE IT GETTING WORSE
YOU1000000138_S0000120	THE PROBLEM IS SO BIG AND SO INGRAINED IS IT ACTUALLY
YOU1000000138_S0000122	POSSIBLE TO SORT OUT IT'S BECOME PART OF SOCIETY
YOU1000000138_S0000124	THE CRIME LEVELS AND THE SHEER AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S AVAILABLE FROM CRIME IS GUARANTEEING THAT MEXICO'S GOING TO SUFFER FOR A VERY VERY LONG TIME
YOU1000000139_S0000001	I'M GARY KASPAROV AND I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF MY MOST MEMORABLE MOMENTS AT THE CHESSBOARD
YOU1000000139_S0000003	IT'S GAME TWENTY FOUR AGAINST ANKARA THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH NINE EIGHTY SEVEN IN SEVILLE SPAIN I WAS
YOU1000000139_S0000005	TWELVE ELEVEN BEFORE THE LAST GAME AND AS A WORLD CHAMPION I HAD MY LAST CHANCE TO RETAIN THE TITLE BY BEATING KARPOV IN THIS GAME TWENTY FOUR CRUCIAL GAME TWENTY FOUR I WAS NOT RUSHING FROM THE BEGINNING I TRIED TO PLAY VERY QUIET POSITIONAL GAME
YOU1000000139_S0000006	WAITING FOR CARS MISTAKES AND THE GAME WAS ADJOURNED TO BE RESUMED NEXT DAY
YOU1000000139_S0000008	AND THE POSITION THAT YOU COULD SEE NOW IT'S HARD TO ASSESS I STILL DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S WINNING FOR WHITE OR IT'S DRAW I WOULD SAY IT'S FIFTY FIFTY WHITE HAS AN EXTRA PAN AS YOU CAN SEE BUT ALL POLLS ARE ON THE SAME SIDE
YOU1000000139_S0000009	THE LIMITED NUMBER OF PIECES SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO ACTUALLY FIND ANY WINNING PLAN FOR WHY
YOU1000000139_S0000011	NEXT DAY WHEN I SHOWED UP AT THE STAGE I WAS A COUPLE OF MINUTES EARLIER I HAVE TO SAY THAT WITH MY COACHES WE HAVE BEEN ANALYZING THIS BUT WE COULDN'T FIND ANY DECISIVE IDEAS AND THEN I SAW KARPF ENTERING THE STAGE
YOU1000000139_S0000013	THAT WAS THE CRUCIAL MOMENT BECAUSE I COULD LOOK AT HIS EYES I COULD LOOK AT HIS BODY AND HE LOOKED DOOMED
YOU1000000139_S0000015	I COULD IMMEDIATELY UNDERSTAND THAT HE DIDN'T BELIEVE HE COULD DEFEND HIS POSITION AND THAT'S EVERYTHING IT'S ABOUT YOUR CONFIDENCE THAT YOU CAN EITHER WIN OR DEFEND AND THAT WILL MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE FOR THE OUTCOME OF THE GAME
YOU1000000139_S0000016	SO KARPOV PLAYED G SIX AND I WAS WAITING JUST PLAYING SOME UNIMPORTANT MOVES IN C FIVE SEVEN EVEN IF THESE MOVES ARE UNIMPORTANT IT ADDS CHANCES THAT YOU WILL MAKE A MISTAKE AND AFTER AGE FOUR KARPOV MADE A DECISIVE MISTAKE
YOU1000000139_S0000018	JUST AMAZING BECAUSE AFTER THE ADJOURNMENT HE HAD TIME TO ANALYZE THIS POSITION HOME AND AND THIS MOVE IT FIXES THE BONE STRUCTURE BUT THE PROBLEM IS NOW WHITE CAN EXCHANGE IS AND BECAUSE THESE POINTS ARE FIXED THESE TWO WEAKNESSES BLACK POSITION WILL BE LOST
YOU1000000139_S0000019	AND EVENTUALLY I IMPROVED MY POSITION BY THREATENING TO CHANGE QUEENS AND PUSHED PUSHED AND PUSHED AND EVENTUALLY WON THE GAME
YOU1000000139_S0000021	SO THAT'S ONE OF THE CLEAREST MOMENTS WHERE YOU COULD SEE THE TRANSLATION OF YOUR PSYCHOLOGICAL WEAKNESS INTO SERIOUS MISTAKES AT THE CHESSBOARD
YOU1000000139_S0000023	IT IS ANOTHER MEMORABLE MOMENT VERY PAINFUL ONE I HAVE TO ADMIT NINETEEN NINETY SIX THE FINAL MATCH FOR GRANDPRE EVENT RAPID BITCHES THAT I PLAYED AGAINST VISION
YOU1000000139_S0000025	I THINK I HAVE TO EMPHASIZE IT'S A BIT GAME SO IT'S A FIVE MINUTE CHESS IT'S NOT ABOUT MAKING LONG TERM CALCULATIONS THIS MOVES PLAYED BY INSTINCT
YOU1000000139_S0000027	WE PLAYED TWO BLITZ GAMES THE FIRST ONE WAS ALMOST LOSING BUT MANAGED TO ESCAPE AND THAT'S THE LAST DECISIVE GAME I PLAYED WAS BLACK TOTALLY OUTPLAYED HIM AS YOU COULD LOOK AT THE POSITION BLACK HAS TWO POINTS LET ME EMPHASIZE TWO EXTRA POINTS
YOU1000000139_S0000029	AND TOTAL DOMINATION IN THE CENTER SO I DON'T KNOW WHICH MOVE IS NOT WINNING YOU KNOW IF YOU DON'T MAKE A MOVE YOU'RE STILL WINNING BUT I WANTED JUST TO EXCHANGE QUEENS AND OF COURSE YOU CAN TAKE IT A NIGHT HERE AND THEN AFTER EXCHANGE OF QUEENS IT'S AN END GAME WITH TWO EXTRA POINTS
YOU1000000139_S0000030	I THINK THAT MOST LIKELY WOULD HAVE RESIGNED IF I JUST TAKE A NIGHT ONE TREE BUT SUDDENLY I THOUGHT YOU KNOW IT WAS A NIGHT IF I DO THE SAME BY EXCHANGING COINS BY TAKING QUEEN
YOU1000000139_S0000031	THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHITE DOES NOT HAVE TO IT'S NOT FORCED TO TAKE THE QUEEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HAS MOVE QUEEN TAKE FOUR AND INSTEAD OF HAVING WINNING POSITION BLACK NOW IS LOST BECAUSE MY QUEEN IS ATTACKED
YOU1000000139_S0000032	MY ROPE IS ATTACKED MY BISHOP IS ATTACKED AND THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT
YOU1000000139_S0000034	THAT'S ONE OF THE WORST BLUNDERS I MEAN I COULDN'T SEE MY FACE I COULD IMAGINE THIS ONE THE HUNDREDS OF HUNDREDS OF IMAGES SHOWING MY CALL IT FRUSTRATION
YOU1000000139_S0000036	AND IT'S IT COST ME THE VICTORY THE FINAL BUT ALSO IT'S KIND OF A MEMORY CARD SO IT'S JUST IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS JUST IT'S IT'S SITTING THERE SO
YOU1000000139_S0000037	EVEN TWENTY YEARS LATER I CANNOT LOOK AT THIS POSITION WITHOUT SOME SORT OF PAIN
YOU1000000139_S0000039	ANOTHER VERY MEMORABLE AND VERY PAINFUL MOMENT
YOU1000000139_S0000041	IT'S THE LAST GAME OF MY FAMOUS REMATCH AGAINST BLUE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN BECAUSE I WON THE FIRST ONE NINETY NINETY SIX THE MATCH WAS A TIE EACH SIDE ON ONE GAME WITH THREE DRAWERS PLAYED WITH BLACK PIECES
YOU1000000139_S0000042	AND I MISSED MY CHANCES GAME FOUR AND FIVE AND I I WASN'T SURE WHEN I STARTED THE GAME AND I PICKED UP THE LINE THAT I NEVER PLAYED BEFORE
YOU1000000139_S0000043	BUT THAT WAS MY HOPE THAT SINCE I NEVER PLAYED IT BEFORE AND IT WAS NOT PART OF MY OPENING REPERTOIRE THAT COMPUTER WOULD NOT BE READY
YOU1000000139_S0000045	AND I PLAY IN THIS POSITION VERY RISKY TO BE PRECISE BAD MOVE SIX ATTACKING THE KNIFE AND PROVOKING WHITE TO SACRIFICE A PIECE WHICH IS VERY STRONG IT'S MAYBE NOT WINNING BUT GIVES IT A VERY STRONG INITIATIVE
YOU1000000139_S0000046	MACHINES DON'T SACRIFICE THE PIECE FOR A PAN WITHOUT HAVING A CONCRETE OUTCOME INSIDE
YOU1000000139_S0000048	SO I EXPECTED THAT COMPUTER WOULD GO BACK ON FOUR BECAUSE THIS MOVE WAS NOT IN THE SPECIAL DATABASE PREPARED BY GRANDMASTER TEAM THAT WORKED WITH THE BLUE
YOU1000000139_S0000049	AND TO MY HORROR DIBLE IMMEDIATELY TOOK ON SIX WHICH MEANT THAT THE MOVE WAS ALREADY PUT IN
YOU1000000139_S0000051	I JUST COULDN'T PLAY THIS GAME POSITION WAS PRETTY DANGEROUS AND BAD BUT YOU KNOW I LOST IT IN FEW MOVIES BECAUSE I WAS SHOCKED BY THE FACT THAT I JUST MADE SUCH MISCALCULATION
YOU1000000139_S0000053	I FOUND OUT LATER ACTUALLY MANY YEARS LATER THAT I WAS RIGHT ON BOTH COUNTS ONE IS THAT MACHINES DIDN'T PLAY SUCH MOVES IT WAS JUST AGAINST MACHINES LOGIC AND THAT WAS ADMITTED BY THE DEEP BLUE TEAM
YOU1000000139_S0000054	SAYING HE WOULD HAVE NEVER MADE THIS MOVE UNLESS THAT VERY MORNING THEY DECIDED TO INSTALL THIS OPENING POSITION IN THE OPENING BOOK MAYBE IT'S THE MOST FAMOUS GAME IN THE HISTORY OF CHESS IF YOU LOOK AT THE SHEER NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO FOLLOWED IT
YOU1000000139_S0000055	MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE IT WAS A WATERSHED MOMENT WHERE MACHINES ESTABLISHED ITS DOMINANCE OVER HUMAN PLAYERS NOW OF COURSE THE FREE CHESS APP ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE TODAY IS STRONGER THAN THE BLUE
YOU1000000139_S0000057	THIS IS ARGUABLY MOST IMPORTANT GAME IN MY LIFE GAME TWENTY FOUR AGAINST ANTONY CARP IN OUR SECOND MATCH NINE EIGHTY FIVE
YOU1000000139_S0000059	I WAS LEADING TWELVE TO ELEVEN BEFORE THE LAST GAME AND KARPOV HAD TO WIN TO RETAIN HIS TITLE
YOU1000000139_S0000061	AND AS YOU CAN SEE HE ACHIEVED VERY PROMISING POSITION IT'S A WHITE CONCENTRATION ON THE KING'S SIDE IT'S MENACING AND WHITE HAS QUITE A FEW OPTIONS ONE IS JUST IT'S I SHOULD ALWAYS WATCH FIVE AS THE BREAKTHROUGH
YOU1000000139_S0000062	ANOTHER ONE IS A LITTLE MORE SUBTLE TO PLAY BISHOP FOUR JUST EXCHANGING THE BISHOP THAT IS ONE OF THE KEY DEFENDERS OF BLACK SKIN AND IF LAGOS FIVE THEN HE TAKES NOW BECAUSE OF THE ATTACK ON SEVEN I HAVE TO TAKE A NIGHT
YOU1000000139_S0000064	BUT THEN QUEEN ACTUALLY CHANGES ITS DIRECTION ATTACKING A SEVEN POINT
YOU1000000139_S0000066	SO THERE ARE MANY OPTIONS FOR WHITE AND IT SEEMS THAT BLACK HAD NOTHING TO DO TO IMPROVE ITS POSITION
YOU1000000139_S0000068	HERE AFTER LONG THOUGHT I FOUND ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT MOVES IN MY LIFE AND AT FIRST SIGHT IT'S A PARADOX BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT YOUR HOOK IN SUCH UGLY POSITION AS SEVEN
YOU1000000139_S0000069	BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO DO INSTEAD OF WHITE YOU KNOW PUSHING ON THE KING'S SIDE THE GAME SHIFTED TO THE CENTER AND THE QUEEN'S SIDE AND PRIORITY HERE IS TO DEFEND THE KING HERE PROTECTS THIS ON AND NEUTRALIZES BOTH OF WHITE THREADS
YOU1000000139_S0000070	AND THAT'S MOST IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF WHITE INITIATIVE DOESN'T PRODUCE IMMEDIATE RESULTS THEN EVENTUALLY BLACK CAN DO SOMETHING
YOU1000000139_S0000072	AND I REMEMBER THAT WHEN I PLAYED SEVEN AND CARPARK CAME BACK TO THE CHESSBOARD FROM HIS GREEN ROOM INSTANTLY YOU COULD FEEL THAT HE SENSED THAT SOMETHING HAS CHANGED HE DIDN'T LIKE IT SO I ACTUALLY GAIN EVEN MORE CONFIDENCE
YOU1000000139_S0000074	YOUR CONFIDENCE IS NOT ONLY GOOD FOR YOU BUT SOMEHOW IT TRANSCENDS TO YOUR OPPONENT AND IT IT UNDERMINES YOUR OPPONENT'S CONFIDENCE
YOU1000000139_S0000076	AND THE CAR MADE A QUIET OF KING DAN I PUT ANOTHER LOOK HERE WHICH IS TOTALLY ODD BECAUSE BOTH ROOKS ARE JUST STANDING BEHIND THE POND ONLY SIX BUT I'M JUST FIGHTING AGAINST FIVE AND THEN CAN EVEN PLAY FIVE
YOU1000000139_S0000077	AND KARA TOOK A PUSAN I TOOK ONE OF SIX AND THEN EVENTUALLY SACRIFICE THE PAN
YOU1000000139_S0000079	GAME ENDED UP WITH A COMPLICATED POSITION THAT KARPOV HAD TO FORCE A DRAW BUT HE DECIDED TO PRESS FORWARD BECAUSE DRAW DIDN'T MAKE ANY GOOD TO HIM AND EVENTUALLY WON THE GAME WON THE MATCH AND WON MY TITLE NOVEMBER NINE NINE EIGHTY FIVE
YOU1000000139_S0000081	YOU HAVE TO MAKE TOUGH DECISIONS AND YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO RESIST PRESSURE AND SURVIVE AFTER PSYCHOLOGICAL BLOWS AND LOSSES IT'S MORE OF A CHARACTER AND WITH SOME GOOD TRAINING IT'S NOT REALLY HARD TO REACH A CERTAIN LEVEL
YOU1000000139_S0000082	DIFFICULTY STARTS WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGHT FOR BIG TITLES AND JUST TO CLIMB TO THE TOP
YOU1000000140_S0000000	THIS PARENTING THING IS HARD MAN YOU NEED PATIENCE YOU GOTTA HAVE A LOT OF PATIENCE TO DEAL WITH THESE KIDS I'M NOT GONNA LIE I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF PATIENCE I'M LEARNING I'M TRYING CERTAIN THINGS MAKE ME MAD LIKE I DON'T I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN I TELL MY KIDS TO DO STUFF AND THEY DO EXACTLY WHAT I SAY
YOU1000000140_S0000001	LIKE I WANT YOU TO DO WHAT I SAY BUT I WANT YOU TO DO IT HOW I PICTURED YOU DOING IT DON'T DO IT THE WAY YOU WANT TO DO IT DO IT THE WAY I SAW YOU DO IT WHEN I TOLD YOU TO DO IT IT MIGHT BE CONFUSING BUT THIS IS SERIOUS TO ME OTHER DAY MY SON HE SCOOPED UP A CANDY HE'S RUNNING ALL OVER THE HOUSE

YOU1000000140_S0000017	SHE CAME INTO THE ROOM SHE WAS LIKE DADDY SAID NO YOU HAD ENOUGH JUST GO GET SOME WATER AND SHE LOOKED AT ME
YOU1000000140_S0000019	AND I LOOKED AT WHO THE FUCK YOU THINK YOU'RE TALKING TO

YOU1000000147_S0000007	THESE WALLET BUSTING MALES COME WITH A HEFTY PRICE TAG OF ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS A POP AFTER BEING GROWN FOR SIX YEARS RATHER THAN THE USUAL EIGHTEEN MONTHS

YOU1000000147_S0000009	THEIR STRONG AROMA AND COMPLEX TASTE HAVE EARNED THEM THE TITLE OF THE OYSTER STAKE OF THE OCEAN
YOU1000000147_S0000010	BUT IF YOU WANT TO SHELL OUT AND SEE FOR YOURSELF YOU'LL HAVE TO HEAD DOWN TO AUSTRALIA'S PENINSULA
YOU1000000147_S0000011	ALMOST CAVIAR OYSTERS ARE A GREAT APPETIZER BUT IF YOU WANT TO GET REAL SWANKY WHY NOT THROW IN SOME CAVIAR
YOU1000000147_S0000012	BEHOLD THE ALMIGHTY AMOS CAVIAR WHICH WILL SET YOU BACK A COOL TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A TWO POINT TWO POUND TEN
YOU1000000147_S0000013	OF COURSE THE TIN IS MADE OF METAL WHICH HAS BEEN BATHED IN TWENTY FOUR KARAT GOLD SO IT'S WORTH EVERY PENNY RIGHT
YOU1000000147_S0000014	CAVIAR IS USUALLY MADE FROM THE EGGS OF THE SEVRUGA CETERA AND BALOGA SPECIES OF STURGEON FISH
YOU1000000147_S0000015	BUT THIS WIDE CAVEAT COMES EXCLUSIVELY FROM THE ALBINO BELUGA STURGEON WHICH LIVES IN THE CASPIAN SEA
YOU1000000147_S0000016	BECAUSE THEIR ALBINISM IS CAUSED BY A GENETIC DISORDER ALBINO BALUKAS ARE EXTREMELY RARE NOWADAYS
YOU1000000147_S0000017	THAT DOESN'T STOP THE FILTHY RICH FROM DASHING THEIR CHANCES OF SURVIVAL EVEN MORE BY EATING THEIR EGGS ANYWAY

YOU1000000147_S0000021	BELIEVE IT OR NOT BIRDS' NEST SOUP IS A MAJOR DELICACY IN CHINA COSTING ANYWHERE BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER KILOGRAM
YOU1000000147_S0000022	THESE AREN'T ANY OLD BIRD'S NEST BUT THE NESTS OF SWALLOWS OR SWIFTLETS WHICH ARE MADE FROM A HUNDRED PERCENT SALIVA
YOU1000000147_S0000023	THAT'S RIGHT THESE BIRDS MAKE THEIR BABIES HOMES OUT OF THEIR OWN SOLIDIFIED SPIT AND SOME CULINARY CONNOISSEURS CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THE STUFF
YOU1000000147_S0000024	WHEN THEY'RE BOILED IN WATER THE DELICATE NEST DISSOLVE INTO A GELATINOUS GOOP WHICH IS SUPPOSEDLY PERFECT FOR SOUPS ME
YOU1000000147_S0000025	THE ASKING PRICE OF ABOUT A HUNDRED DOLLARS PER BOWL CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO HOW HARD THE NESTS ARE TO GET A HOLD OF IN THE FIRST PLACE
YOU1000000147_S0000026	CLIMBERS MUST SCALE THE DARK AND DIZZYING HEIGHTS OF THE MEDIA CAVES IN MALAYSIA TO SCOUT FOR NESTS THAT ARE READY FOR THE PICKING
YOU1000000147_S0000027	IDEALLY AFTER ONE BATCH OF EGGS IS HATCHED BUT BEFORE A SECOND AFTER THAT EACH TINY FEATHER MUST BE INDIVIDUALLY REMOVED BY HAND

YOU1000000147_S0000030	THIS LAMBORGHINI POULTRY GROWS AT A SLOWER RATE AND SUPPOSEDLY TASTE SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN YOUR EVERYDAY KIND BUT SIMONIS AREN'T ACTUALLY EATING FOR THEIR FLAVOR
YOU1000000147_S0000031	THE REASON FOR ITS ELUSIVENESS AND DESIRABILITY IS THAT THE BIRD CAN BE TRACED BACK TO JAPANESE FOLKLORE OF THE TWELFTH CENTURY
YOU1000000147_S0000032	WHERE IT WAS CONSIDERED A MYSTICAL FOOD OF THE ELITE ITS CHARCOAL COLORED BLOOD IS ALSO RUMORED TO BRING POWER AND WEALTH UPON THOSE WHO CONSUME IT MAKING IT A SOUGHT AFTER GOOD LUCK CHARM IN CERTAIN CULTURES
YOU1000000147_S0000033	SIMONIS ARE HARD TO COME BY IN THE U S SO THE ASKING PRICE CAN BE UP TO TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A FULL GROWN BIRD AND TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR A SINGLE NEWBORN CHICK
YOU1000000147_S0000034	TOBY BEEF
YOU1000000147_S0000035	STATE MAKES A MEAN MAIN COURSE BUT IF YOU WANT A TRULY PREMIUM EXPERIENCE THERE'S ONE KIND THAT'LL DO THE JOB

YOU1000000147_S0000038	KOBE BEEF IS RENOWNED FOR ITS SUPERIOR FLAVOR TENDERNESS AND HIGH AMOUNT OF INNER MUSCULAR FAT WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO ITS MELT IN THE MOUTH QUALITIES
YOU1000000147_S0000039	ALL WAGYU BEEF IS RATED ON A MARVELING SCALE OF ONE TO TWELVE BASED ON THIS DISTRIBUTION OF FAT AND COBEY BEEF ONLY QUALIFIES IF IT SCORES BETWEEN TEN TO TWELVE
YOU1000000147_S0000040	THE LUXURY BEEF MARKET HAS EVEN BEEN TAINTED BY CONTROVERSY AFTER NUMEROUS ESTABLISHMENTS TRIED TO PASS OFF REGULAR WAGYU BEEF COBY
YOU1000000147_S0000041	WITH KOBE FRAUD RAMPANT IN THE US ALL CUTS MUST NOW BE ASSIGNED A TEN DIGIT ID NUMBER SO THAT IT CAN BE TRACED BACK TO THE COW IT CAME FROM
YOU1000000147_S0000042	RESTAURANTEURS MUST ALSO CARRY A LICENSE OF AUTHENTICITY THAT CAN BE SHOWN ON DEMAND
YOU1000000147_S0000043	SO IF YOU'RE A BEEF AFICIONADO IT'S WORTH CHECKING BEFORE SHELLING OUT UP TO THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR A SINGLE POUND OF MEAT

YOU1000000147_S0000049	THE MEAT COMES FROM PRIZED FREE RANGE BLONDE AQUITAINE CATTLE AND IS PRODUCED BY PARISIAN BUTCHER ALEXANDRE POLMAR ON HIS FAMILY FARM IN NORTHEASTERN FRANCE
YOU1000000147_S0000050	THE EXTORTIONATE PRICE TAG IS THANKS TO THE TECHNIQUE BOMAR DEVELOPED IN THE NINETEEN NINETY S TO TREAT THE MEAT
YOU1000000147_S0000051	THE CATTLE ARE HAND REARED AND FREE TO ROAM THE FOREST AND GRASSLANDS OF THE FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE AND ONLY FOUR KILLED WEEKLY
YOU1000000147_S0000052	EACH COW IS THEN SLAUGHTERED HUMANELY TO MAKE THE PROCESS AS STRESS FREE AS POSSIBLE AND TO KEEP ACIDITY LEVELS AT A MINIMUM
YOU1000000147_S0000053	THE MEAT IS THEN STORED IN A ROOM AND PUMPED WITH A CONSTANT STREAM OF AIR AT SPEEDS OF ALMOST SEVENTY FIVE MILES PER HOUR
YOU1000000147_S0000054	AND TEMPERATURES OF NEGATIVE FORTY FIVE DEGREES FAHRENHEIT WORD REMAINS IN THIS STATE OF FORCED HYBERNATION FOR FIFTEEN YEARS
YOU1000000147_S0000055	TO SEE IF IT'S REALLY WORTH IT YOU'LL HAVE TO VISIT PALMER'S STORE IN PARIS VERY FEW RESTAURANTS ARE ENTRUSTED WITH THE BEEF AND PALMER PAYS EACH ESTABLISHMENT A PERSONAL VISIT BEFORE THEY'RE EVEN ALLOWED TO SERVE IT

YOU1000000147_S0000059	WHY YOU ASK FIRSTLY THEY'RE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY GROWN ON THE TINY ISLAND OF NOTE OFF THE COAST OF WESTERN FRANCE AND ONLY ABOUT TWENTY TONS ARE PRODUCED YEARLY
YOU1000000147_S0000060	PREPARING THEM FOR SALE IS ALSO AN ARDUOUS PROCESS BECAUSE THEY'RE TOO DELICATE TO BE MACHINE HARVESTED
YOU1000000147_S0000061	SO EACH POTATO MUST BE CAREFULLY HANDPICKED INSTEAD WITH ALL THE ADDED EFFORT IT TAKES TO GET A HOLD OF THEM YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING WHY LABANT POTATOES ARE WORTH EATING TO BEGIN WITH
YOU1000000147_S0000062	FANS OF THE SOUPED UP SPUD SAY THE SEA AIR AND SEA WATER WHICH ACTS AS A FERTILIZER FOR THE SOIL GIVES THE POTATOES A HINT OF SEA SALT AND EVEN A SUGGESTION OF LEMON
YOU1000000147_S0000063	IF YOU FANCY LABANT FOR TEA YOU SHOULD PROBABLY KNOW THAT THEY SELL FOR ABOUT THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER POUND

YOU1000000147_S0000066	AND EVEN THE ROMANS COULDN'T GET ENOUGH ATTRIBUTING THEM WITH THERAPEUTIC AND APHRODISIAC PROPERTIES
YOU1000000147_S0000067	WHITE TRUFFLES OR THE DIAMOND OF THE KITCHEN ARE BY FAR THE BEST THE NOBLE WHITE MUSHROOMS CAN ONLY BE HARVESTED BETWEEN OCTOBER THROUGH DECEMBER
YOU1000000147_S0000068	AND THE FOREST OF PIEDMONT AND NORTHERN ITALY WHERE THEY GROW INCHES BELOW THE EARTH WITH THE ROOTS OF HARDWOOD TREES WHICH MEANS FINDING THEM ISN'T EASY
YOU1000000147_S0000069	SPECIALLY TRAINED DOGS OR PIGS KNOWN AS TRAITORS MUST SCOUR THE FOREST FLOOR IN SEARCH OF HIDDEN GEMS BELOW THE EARTH
YOU1000000147_S0000070	SCIENTISTS HAVE TRIED AND FAILED TO DOMESTICATE WHITE TRUFFLES MEANING YOU ALSO WON'T BE STUMBLING UPON ANY IN YOUR LOCAL SUPERMARKET ANYTIME SOON
YOU1000000147_S0000071	THESE FACTORS ALL CONTRIBUTE TO THE FERVOR SURROUNDING TRUFFLES AND THE VALUE THEIR COMPLEX FLAVOR CAN BRING TO RISOTTO PASTA AND EVEN FOR JUST ONE POUND OF WHITE TRUFFLES COST AROUND TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS

YOU1000000147_S0000077	THAT'S WHEN THEY MADE AN UNUSUAL DISCOVERY CIVET CATS WOULD EAT COFFEE CHERRIES AND POOP OUT THE SEEDS OR COFFEE BEANS WITHOUT DIGESTING
YOU1000000147_S0000078	AFTER BREWING COFFEE FROM THE DISCARDED BEANS THEY REALIZED IT TASTED GREAT TOO MOSTLY BECAUSE THE SOVIETS PICKED ONLY THE RIPEST CHERRIES
YOU1000000147_S0000079	THE TRADITION CONTINUED AND NOWADAYS VENDORS OF AUTHENTIC COPILOT COFFEE CAN COMMAND ANYWHERE BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS TO A THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED PER KILOGRAM
YOU1000000147_S0000080	THERE ARE SOME CONTROVERSIES SURROUNDING THE UNCONVENTIONAL BEVERAGE THOUGH PRIMARILY CIVIC CATS ARE NOCTURNAL AND DON'T HAVE BIG APPETITE
YOU1000000147_S0000081	WHICH MEANS MORE THAN EIGHTY PERCENT OF KOTILA COFFEE SOLD IN THE U S HAS NEVER ACTUALLY PASSED THROUGH ONE
YOU1000000147_S0000082	ATTEMPTS TO INDUSTRIALIZE THE PROCESS ALSO MEANS MANY CIVET CATS ARE CAGED AND FORCE FED THE BERRIES ROUND THE CLOCK WHICH RESULTS IN CRAPPY COFFEE MADE BY VERY CRAPPY PEOPLE
YOU1000000147_S0000083	TANSKI BLACK WATERMELON

YOU1000000147_S0000098	KONISHI SAID HE OFFERED SUCH A FEE FOR THE MELONS TO PAY BACK THE HARD WORK OF THE BAR FARMERS
YOU1000000147_S0000099	BUT EVEN A LESS COVETED BUYER CAN STILL EXPECT TO PAY THOUSANDS AT AUCTION JAPAN'S LUXURY FRUIT MARKET ISN'T JUST EXCLUSIVE TO MELONS
YOU1000000147_S0000100	AND IN TWENTY NINETEEN KAKUMARU KONISHI RAISED EYEBROWS AGAIN AFTER PAYING ELEVEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN DOLLARS FOR A BUNCH OF RUBY ROMAN GRAPES

YOU1000000147_S0000109	GETTING MILK FROM THE DONKEYS ISN'T EASY BECAUSE ONLY ABOUT TWENTY ANIMALS PRODUCE IT AT ONE TIME
YOU1000000147_S0000110	AND IT TAKES SEVERAL GALLONS OF MILK TO MAKE ONE POUND OF CHEESE
YOU1000000147_S0000111	THIS IS BECAUSE THEIR MILK DOESN'T CONTAIN ENOUGH CASE THE CHARACTERISTIC THAT THICKENS IT INTO CURVE TO MAKE THE CHEESE THE TRADITIONAL WAY

YOU1000000150_S0000043	THE SURROUNDS FOR THESE PARKING SENSORS JUST LOOK AWFUL THEY DON'T EVEN FIT PROPERLY YEAH FOR SOME REASON YOU CAN'T GET THE BENTLY CONTINENTAL GET WITH ANDROID AUTO WHAT IS THAT BECAUSE ANDROID PHONES AREN'T AS GOOD AS IPHONES I THINK NOT BECAUSE THE NEW GALAXY
YOU1000000150_S0000044	NINE IS DEFINITELY BETTER THAN AN IPHONE TEN DISCUSSED IN THE COMMENT BOX BELOW I LOVE THE SHINY GRILL IT JUST LOOKS EXPENSIVE SHAME THEN THE REST OF THE VENTS A CHEAP PLASTIC MESH KIND OF THING THAT YOU FIND ON A BUDGET HATCHBACK
YOU1000000150_S0000045	WHEN YOU'RE DRIVING THE LIGHT REFLECTS IN THIS SHINING STRIP AND IT CATCHES THE CORNER OF YOUR EYE AND YOU ALWAYS THINK HE'S ANOTHER VEHICLE JUST IN YOUR BLIND SPOT DON'T WORRY THERE'S STILL PLENTY TO LIKE ABOUT THIS CAR HERE'S THE CAR WOW FIVE CALL FEATURES THE HEAD UP DISPLAY IS REALLY BIG
YOU1000000150_S0000046	AND BRIGHT AND VERY USEFUL WHILE YOU'RE DRIVING IT CAN SHOW THINGS LIKE THE DIRECTIONS ON THE SATELLITE NAVIGATION YOUR SPEED AND THE ACTUAL SPEED LIMIT WHEN YOU PUT THE REAR SPOILER UP MANUALLY IT SHOWS THAT YOU'VE DONE THAT ON A LITTLE GRAPHIC ON THE CAR'S DISPLAY JUST KIND OF COOL
YOU1000000150_S0000047	I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE LOOK OF THE LIGHTS THEY'VE BEEN DESIGNED TO LOOK LIKE DIAMONDS AND MAYBE THEY'RE JUST SWAROVSKI CRYSTAL THAT'S BEEN ISN'T IT DEFINITELY DIAMONDS DIGITAL DISPLAY A LITTLE BIT TOO MODERN FOR YOU
YOU1000000150_S0000048	DON'T WORRY YOU CAN TURN BACK TIME BY ROTATING THE SCREEN AROUND FOR SOME ANALOG DIALS AND THEN WHEN YOU TURN THE CAR OFF I'LL JUST FLIP AWAY
YOU1000000150_S0000050	REVEALED JUST A NICE CLEAN SIMPLE WOODEN SURFACE THESE ARE THE BIGGEST IRON BRAKE DISC ON ANY PRODUCTION CAR THEY'RE FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLIMETRES IN DIAMETER NO WONDER IT STOPS AS WELL
YOU1000000150_S0000051	NOW IT'S TIME TO HIT THE ROAD TO SEE WHAT THIS CAR IS LIKE TO DRIVE
YOU1000000150_S0000053	HOW FAST CAN A CAR WHICH WAS TWO POINT TWO TONS ACTUALLY BE WELL WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT BECAUSE I'VE GOT SOME SPECIAL TIMING EQUIPMENT UP THERE I'M GONNA LAUNCH THIS BENTLEY
YOU1000000150_S0000055	RIKE
YOU1000000150_S0000057	THIS IS NOT THIS IS VERY VERY VERY VERY FAST
YOU1000000150_S0000059	WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW
YOU1000000150_S0000061	GOTTA HAND IT TO THE BRAKES FIRST OF ALL I MEAN THEY SLAMMED ON THE ANCHORS THAT'S GOOD NEWS THE BRAKES ARE GOOD BUT WHAT ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE
YOU1000000150_S0000063	THE STANDING QUARTER TIME IS ELEVEN POINT SEVEN SECONDS I'M GONNA CHECK OUT THE NOT SIXTY AS WELL IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO IT IN THREE POINT SEVEN SECONDS BUT WHAT DID I GET THREE POINT SIX SECONDS
YOU1000000150_S0000065	THIS IS RAPID SO THEN WHY IS THIS CAR SO PLUMBING QUICK WELL THAT'S BECAUSE UNDERNEATH THE BONNET IS A SIX LITER TWELVE TWIN TURBO CHARGED PETROL ENGINE WITH
YOU1000000150_S0000066	SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE HORSEPOWER AND NINE HUNDRED NEWTON METERS OF TALK
YOU1000000150_S0000067	AND I LOVE THIS ENGINE IT IS SO POWERFUL THERE'S SOMETHING ALMOST GEOLOGICAL TO IT IN THE WAY THAT IT'S RELENTLESS AND IT MAKES THE NOISE
YOU1000000150_S0000069	OF ERUPTING VOLCANO IT IS SO GOOD NOW THERE IS A SMALL MATTER OF ECONOMY AND EMISSIONS WHICH YEAH THEY'RE NOT GREAT THEY'RE NOT GREAT BUT I'M ACTUALLY AVERAGING TWENTY TWO MILES PER GALLON
YOU1000000150_S0000070	NOW THAT COULD BE QUITE EXPENSIVE BUT IF YOU CAN AFFORD THIS CAR YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT IS HOW FAR YOU CAN GO BETWEEN FUEL STOPS AND THIS GUY HAS A BIG PETROL TANK SO WITH THAT ECONOMY
YOU1000000150_S0000072	I COULD GO ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES BETWEEN HAVING TO PULL UP AND RUB SHOULDERS WITH NORMAL PEOPLE AT A PETROL STATION I CAN TWIST A DIAL DOWN HERE AND PUT EVERYTHING IN COMFORT MODE AND IT SOFTENS OFF THE AIR SUSPENSION
YOU1000000150_S0000073	AND THEN DOES THROTTLE RESPONSE MAKES THE STEERING A BIT LIGHTER AND IT'S ALL WAFTY AND RELAXING AND COMFREY THE BEST MODE THOUGH IS A SPECIAL BENTLY MODE WHICH IS THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS BETWEEN SPORTINESS AND COMFORT YEAH YOU CHUCK IT INTO A CORNER
YOU1000000150_S0000074	AND IT SOMEHOW GRIPS AND GOES ROUND FOR INSTANCE I'M ON A TWISTY ROAD NOW AND
YOU1000000150_S0000076	IT'S SURPRISINGLY GOOD YOU SEE THIS NEW CONTINENTAL GET SEEMS TO JUST CONTINUE JUST HOLDING ITS LINE WHEREAS THE OLD ONE WOULD HAVE KIND OF JUST RUN OUT TALENT AND STARTED TO WOBBLE OFF THE ROAD IT IS GENUINELY GOOD FUN WHEN YOU GET THE OPPORTUNITY
YOU1000000150_S0000077	TO THROW A POWER PIT
YOU1000000150_S0000079	IT'S A BIT WRONG DOING THIS IT'S A BIT LIKE DRIVING THE BRITISH MUSEUM REALLY FAST DOWN THE ROAD
YOU1000000150_S0000081	YOU CAN DO IT WITH TOTAL CONFIDENCE I MEAN THE FOUR WHEEL DRIVE SYSTEM JUST GRIPS AND GRIPS AND GRIPS IT'S REALLY REALLY IMPRESSIVE
YOU1000000150_S0000083	IT CAN SEND LOADS OF POWER TO THE BACK I MEAN IT IS REAR DRIVE BY SO IT FEELS SPORTY
YOU1000000150_S0000084	YEAH IT'S IT'S NOT QUITE AS AGILE AS SOMETHING LIKE A FERRARI GTC FOR LOSO BUT I THINK IT'S NICER INSIDE I COULD LIVE LIKE THIS CAN ACTUALLY BE CRITICAL
YOU1000000150_S0000085	THERE IS SOMETHING I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THE DRIVING EXPERIENCE AND THAT'S THE VISIBILITY WHICH IS KIND OF LETTERBOX LIKE THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE IT IS THE ANYTHING ELSE I DON'T LIKE
YOU1000000150_S0000087	NOW IF YOU CLICK ON THE POP OUT IN THE TOP RIGHT HAND CORNER OF THE SCREEN ON THE LINK BELOW THE VIDEO YOU CAN GO TO CARLOW DOT COM TO SEE HOW MUCH YOU CAN SAVE ON A NEW CAR SO THEN WHAT'S MY FINAL VERDICT ON THE BENTLY CONTINENTAL GET SHOULD YOU AVOID IT SHOULD YOU CONSIDER IT SHOULD YOU SHORTLIST IT

YOU1000000150_S0000092	NOW DID YOU SPOT THE EAST IN THIS VIDEO IT WAS THE CONTINENTAL CHOCOLATE IN THE CAR'S GLOVE BOX
YOU1000000151_S0000001	THE FURS AND IT'S SISTERS HAVE GOTTEN A LOT OF ATTENTION AS THE AFFORDABLE ENTHUSIAST REAR WHEEL DRIVE CAR THE DEFACTO STANDARD HOWEVER THE BRITISH PIONEERED THIS IDEA AND THE JAPANESE REFINED IT SO WE BROUGHT ALONG
YOU1000000151_S0000003	TWO THOUSAND AND MADE EIGHT TO FIND OUT IF THE TRULY IS THE BEST EXAMPLE
YOU1000000151_S0000004	AND THESE ARE THE TWO THAT YOU'VE ASKED FOR I MEAN WE'VE HAD SO MANY REQUESTS
YOU1000000151_S0000006	I'M EXCITED TO DO IT BUT I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED I MAY HAVE DUG MYSELF A WHOLE
YOU1000000151_S0000007	WELL SO WHAT'S WRONG
YOU1000000151_S0000008	WELL ON THE PCH PIECE I MAY HAVE SAID I MAY HAVE SAID THAT THE FORT WAS BETTER
YOU1000000151_S0000010	I THINK YOU DID SAY THAT
YOU1000000151_S0000011	I THINK I REMEMBER THAT SO NOW I AM PREPARED TO BE WRONG WE HAVE THEM HERE I'M PREPARED TO DRIVE THEM I'M PREPARED TO BE WRONG
YOU1000000151_S0000012	I THINK I'M GONNA BE WRONG TOO I THINK
YOU1000000151_S0000013	ACTUALLY YOU KNOW WHAT NO MATTER HOW THIS GOES THE FANBOYS FOR THESE CARS ARE SO SERIOUS
YOU1000000151_S0000014	THAT'S TRUE THAT'S GOING TO BE THIS IS THE WRONG REVIEW THE THE WRONG
YOU1000000151_S0000016	THAT WHATEVER WE SAY
YOU1000000151_S0000018	THIS IS ABOUT THE ONLY TIME YOU'RE GOING TO SEE ALL THREE OF THESE CARS UNBIASED BY NONOWNERS TOGETHER THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE YOU'VE ASKED FOR IT SO LET'S GO WRONG
YOU1000000151_S0000020	SO HERE IS THE SAME WHITE FURS WE HAD ON OUR PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY SHOOT
YOU1000000151_S0000022	IT'S ONE OF THE FIRST EIGHTY SIX THAT WERE IN THE COUNTRY AND I JUST LIKE THIS CAR
YOU1000000151_S0000023	IT'S ALWAYS NICE TO GET BACK IN A CAR THAT YOU REMEMBERED LOVING AND IT DIDN'T LET YOU DOWN
YOU1000000151_S0000025	THE RS IS NOT DISAPPOINTING ME PERSONALLY I FEEL LIKE THE R IS THE BETTER SET UP HOWEVER AND I'M GETTING BACK TO THE FIRS THINKING I LOVED IT BUT WE WERE COMPARING IT AGAINST DIFFERENT CARS
YOU1000000151_S0000026	THE TWO CARS WE BROUGHT ALONG WITH IT PRETTY STEEP COMPETITION
YOU1000000151_S0000028	LAST TIME WE DROVE THE RIGHT FOR THE SHOW I WAS IN FOUR THIS IS TWENTY ELEVEN IN FACT IT'S THE LAST EIGHT THREE SOLD IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND I MAINTAIN THAT EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS CAR IS JUST ODD
YOU1000000151_S0000029	KIND OF OFF KILTER UNIQUE THE SECOND GENERATION RIGHT IS DEFINITELY MORE REFINED THAN THE FIRST GENERATION
YOU1000000151_S0000030	AFTER HAVING DRIVEN THE FIRST GENERATION X EIGHT I FEEL LIKE THAT CAR WAS MORE WILLING JUST SLIGHTLY MORE WILLING THAN THIS CAR BUT WHAT I DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY'VE DONE IS COMPLETELY TAKE AWAY THAT FUN TO DRIVE THAT JUST
YOU1000000151_S0000031	BRILLIANT ENTHUSIASM SO THIS CAR REPRESENTS THE MOST SORDID BEST EXAMPLE OF THAT
YOU1000000151_S0000033	OF COURSE THERE'S TWO VERSIONS OF THE HANDS TWO THOUSAND AND THEY ARE MUCH DEBATED THE P ONE AND THE TWO THIS IS AN AP TWO IF YOU WANT TO GO WITH THE ONE VERSION WITH A HIGHER RED LINE AND A LITTLE BIT MORE TAIL HAPPY SUSPENSION
YOU1000000151_S0000034	THEN YOU CAN GET THEM CHEAPER BUT IN THIS TWO THEY DEFINITELY REFINED THE CAR AND OF COURSE YOU'RE BUYING ONE OF THE MOST RELIABLE CARS EVER MADE THE GUY THAT OWNS THIS HAS GOT ALMOST EIGHTY THOUSAND MILES ON IT HAS NEVER DONE ANYTHING MORE THAN STANDARD MAINTENANCE
YOU1000000151_S0000035	WHAT'S GREAT IS YOU'VE GOT THAT NEARLY BULLETPROOF NATURE OF HONDA CAR SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT BEATING ON THIS THING NOW THE CAR WE'RE DRIVING TODAY IS THE CAR WE DROVE IN OUR STANDALONE HAND TWO THOUSAND REVIEW SO DRIVING IT LATER
YOU1000000151_S0000036	IT'S GOT OF COURSE MORE MILES AND IT STILL FEELS FRESH I'M SAD TO SAY THESE CARS ARE NO LONGER IN THE MARKET AND IT'S ALSO A TRAGEDY THAT HAND IS BUILDING THINGS LIKE THE HAND PANAMA I MEAN THE HAND CROSS TO HER
YOU1000000151_S0000038	GETTING RIGHT OUT OF THE OTHER CARS INTO THE FORT IS TRULY REVEALING I WASN'T THINKING THAT THE FR NEEDED MORE POWER I THOUGHT IT WAS FINE
YOU1000000151_S0000040	I'M WRONG ABOUT THAT IN SPITE OF BEING THE LEAST POWERFUL THE FURS IS ACTUALLY THE EASIEST TO LAUNCH BUT IT ALSO RUNS OUT OF BREATH THE FASTEST I MEAN ABOVE ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND RPMS IF YOU PUT YOUR FOOT TO THE FLOOR
YOU1000000151_S0000041	YOU EXPECT THAT EXTRA LITTLE SURGE WHEN YOU MAP THE GAS AND IT JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN HERE I AM STEPPING ON THE THROTTLE AND I FEEL LIKE THE FURS IS HOLDING SOMETHING BACK
YOU1000000151_S0000043	AND THAT FEELING ISN'T THAT IT'S HOLDING SOMETHING BACK IT JUST DOESN'T HAVE ANY MORE TO GIVE
YOU1000000151_S0000045	NOW THIS TWO THOUSAND HAS THE FORTY MORE HORSEPOWER THAT WE WISH WE HAD IN THE FURS
YOU1000000151_S0000047	BUT IT HAS ALMOST THE EXACT SAME
YOU1000000151_S0000049	SO BECAUSE OF COURSE THE MUCH LOVED HONDA VTEC ENGINE YOU GOT TO READ IT PRETTY HIGH TO FIND THE POWER IN THIS CAR
YOU1000000151_S0000050	THERE'S ENOUGH THERE I'M NOT WANTING FOR POWER AND AS HARD AS YOU CAN RUB THE ENGINE IT'S JUST A CONSTANT SURGE
YOU1000000151_S0000052	AND YOU FEEL THAT VTECH CHANGE OVER AT ABOUT SIX THOUSAND RPMS AND IT GIVES YOU THAT EXTRA LITTLE KICK IN THE ASS WHEN THE RS IS JUST DYING AWAY THE TWO THOUSAND IS A SECOND FASTER ZERO TO SIXTY THAN THE R S
YOU1000000151_S0000053	I MEAN THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE ONLY STATE YOU NEED TO KNOW TO REMIND YOU THAT THE S IS JUST UNDERPOWERED
YOU1000000151_S0000055	THE R EIGHT ALSO HAS THE MISSING INGREDIENT THE FR DOES NOT MORE POWER
YOU1000000151_S0000056	AND THIS ENGINE IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT IT'S ATYPICAL IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT ITS REPUTATION IS NOT ALL THAT RELIABLE IT'S SO SILKY SMOOTH IT FEELS LIKE SOMEHOW THIS ENGINE IS BETTER LUBRICATED AND BETTER BUILT THAN ANYTHING YOU'VE EVER DRIVEN
YOU1000000151_S0000057	THERE'S NO VIBRATION IT JUST SINGS UP THROUGH THE RPM HEADED TOWARD ITS NINE THOUSAND RPM RED LINE HOWEVER EVEN THOUGH THE EIGHT IS MORE POWERFUL THAN THE FURS DOESN'T ACTUALLY FEEL LIKE IT
YOU1000000151_S0000058	IT'S NOT REALLY ANY FASTER AND LIKE HERS IT NEVER GIVES ME AS MUCH AS I EXPECT
YOU1000000151_S0000060	THE RAT MAKES GREAT POWER YOU'RE JUST GOING TO NOT THINK THAT IT DOES ANYWHERE BELOW FIVE THOUSAND RPM
YOU1000000151_S0000062	YOU'VE GOT TO GRAB THIS CAR BY THE SCRUFF OF THE NECK SMACK IT AROUND AND MAKE IT YOUR BITCH OTHERWISE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE SMILING ONCE YOU DO YOU WILL BE HAPPY
YOU1000000151_S0000064	NOW I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FOR EVERY PERSON YOU HEAR ABOUT WHO'S GONE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND MILES ON THEIR FIRST ROTARY ENGINE THERE'S THE GUY NEXT TO HIM WITH AN THAT'S DONE THREE ENGINES IN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND MILES THE BIG TRICK IS THESE ENGINES BURN A LOT OF GAS
YOU1000000151_S0000065	AND THEY BURN A LOT OF OIL JUST DURING THE HARD DRIVING OF THIS SHOOT WE'VE BURNED ALMOST A HALF QUART OF OIL
YOU1000000151_S0000067	NOW WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT ALL THREE OF THESE CARS IS THEY'VE GOT ELECTRIC POWER STEERING
YOU1000000151_S0000068	FOR ALL THE COMPLAINTS THAT ARE HAPPENING RIGHT NOW FOR POOR ELECTRIC STEERING RACK IN CARS EACH OF THESE THREE CARS HAVE ELECTRIC POWER STEERING AND ALL OF THEM GET IT RIGHT
YOU1000000151_S0000069	SO IF YOU'VE ASSOCIATED ELECTRIC POWER STEERING WITH SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT WHEN YOU'RE DRIVING OR FEEL GOOD OR HAVE GOOD STEERING FEEDBACK YOU'RE COMPLETELY WRONG
YOU1000000151_S0000071	THE STEERING ON THE RIGHT DOESN'T FEEL QUITE AS SHARP BUT WHAT'S NICE IS THE HARDER YOU PUSH THIS CAR THE BETTER IT GETS
YOU1000000151_S0000072	YOU COMPARE THE RIGHT STEERING TO MOST CARS IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO WIN IT IS A VERY INFORMATIVE STEERING RACK BUT IT FEELS LARGER AND MORE DISCONNECTED THAN THE OTHER TWO CARS
YOU1000000151_S0000074	IF YOU THINK THE HANDLING ON THE RIGHT IS NUMB YOU OUGHT TO HAVE YOUR HEAD EXAMINED I WOULD SAY THE STEERING FEELS SLIGHTLY MUTED BUT IT DOESN'T FEEL NUMB
YOU1000000151_S0000076	THIS IS SO STRANGE I CAN FEEL THE LONGER WHEELBASE BUT IT PLANTS ITSELF SO WELL
YOU1000000151_S0000078	NOW THIS R THREE MAKES IT FAR MORE AGGRESSIVE IT'S GOT STIFFER SUSPENSION AND IN FACT THIS CAR HAS THE LONGEST WHEELBASE BUT THE WORST RIDE ON THE HIGHWAY IT JUST KIND OF VIBRATES AND POPS AS YOU GO ALONG AT NORMAL HIGHWAY SPEEDS
YOU1000000151_S0000080	EVEN IN THIS COMPANY THE RS IS AN INCREDIBLY EASY CAR TO DRIVE VERY FAST NOW OF COURSE IT CAN'T GET UP TO SPEED AS FAST BUT ONCE YOU'RE THERE THIS CAN HANG ON TO SPEED IN CORNERS ALMOST BETTER THAN THE OTHER TWO
YOU1000000151_S0000081	WITH A BETTER SET OF TIRES I THINK YOU CAN OUT GRIP THEM BOTH BUT THE GREAT THING IS THIS JUST TELLS YOU SO MUCH ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON THAT IT GIVES YOU A LOT OF CONFIDENCE PARTIALLY BECAUSE THE LIMITS IN THE RS ARE LOW ENOUGH THAT YOU CAN APPROACH THEM SAFELY AND YOU CAN FEEL THEM COMING
YOU1000000151_S0000083	SOME WAYS THE FIRS IS LIKE HAVING A REALLY GOOD NAVIGATOR THEY'RE TELLING YOU INFORMATION ALL THE TIME AND THE FASTER YOU DRIVE THE MORE THEIR INFORMATION JUST INCREASES
YOU1000000151_S0000084	I REALLY DO LOVE THE LIABILITY OF THIS CAR IT REALLY DOES SEEM LIKE IT'S ON AN EDGE
YOU1000000151_S0000086	THE CHASE DYNAMICS ARE GOOD BECAUSE OF THAT LOW CENTER OF GRAVITY BECAUSE OF WHERE THAT ENGINE IS AT BUT TO TURN THE FURS FROM REALLY REALLY GOOD INTO GREAT IT NEEDS MORE POWER
YOU1000000151_S0000087	I WAS WRONG
YOU1000000151_S0000089	IT'S GOOD
YOU1000000151_S0000091	BUT IT ISN'T THE HAND TWO THOUSAND
YOU1000000151_S0000093	THERE'S ZERO BODY ROLL IN THIS CAR I MEAN SORT OF LIKE THE CORE ONE WE DROVE THIS HAS GOT THE LEAST BODY ROLL I'VE EVER FELT OF COURSE THE TWO THOUSAND BRAGS A FIFTY FIFTY WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION AND IT WEIGHS WITH THE WEIGHS
YOU1000000151_S0000095	THIS CAR'S HANDLING IS UNBELIEVABLY SHARP AND WHAT I LOVE IS YOU CAN JUST ROLL ONTO THE THROTTLE AND PUSH IT HARDER AND HARDER
YOU1000000151_S0000097	THROUGH THE CORNER JUST LIKE YOU DO A MOTORCYCLE THE HARDER YOU ROLL ONTO THE THROTTLE THE MORE IT SETTLES THE CAR
YOU1000000151_S0000098	THE FS HAS A LITTLE BIT BETTER INITIAL TURN IN BECAUSE THE STEERING RACK IS TIGHTER BUT THE TWO THOUSAND SEEMS TO LINK THE CORNER MORE CONSISTENTLY THAN THE RS IT GETS A LITTLE BIT SLIDE A LITTLE BIT OF SCRUB GOING ON AND THE TWO THOUSAND JUST CLINGS AND HANGS ON
YOU1000000151_S0000100	GETTING BACK IN THE R IS LIKE LOOKING UP YOUR HIGH SCHOOL SWEETHEART ON FACEBOOK
YOU1000000151_S0000102	FINDING OUT THAT SHE'S
YOU1000000151_S0000104	ALMOST AS GOOD AS YOU REMEMBER HER BUT HERE'S THE THING ABOUT THE FS THIS IS VERSION ONE POINT
YOU1000000151_S0000106	DESIGNED THIS CAR AND MADE IT SPECIFICALLY WITH THE THINKING IN MIND
YOU1000000151_S0000107	PEOPLE WOULD BE ADDING TO IT HOWEVER I WANT THIS CAR TO BE JUST THAT MUCH BETTER IT'S SO GOOD WHY CAN'T IT BE RIGHT
YOU1000000151_S0000108	I REALLY DO LOVE THIS CAR I STEP AWAY FOR A WHILE AND I THINK IT REALLY PROBABLY WASN'T THAT GOOD AND I COME BACK AND I REALIZE YOU KNOW WHAT THE F R S IS OVERHYPED BUT THE ACCOLADES IT'S GOTTEN ARE COMPLETELY DESERVED
YOU1000000151_S0000109	THIS IS A REALLY IMPRESSIVE CAR IT IS A REWARDING AND FUN TO DRIVE CAR AND HOW RARELY IS THAT AVAILABLE AT TWENTY FIVE BRAND NEW
YOU1000000151_S0000111	THIS HAS ALL THE REFINEMENT AND THE FINE TUNING THAT THE JUST HASN'T GOTTEN YET I EXPECT THAT IT WILL BUT THIS IS ABOUT AS GREAT AS THIS CAR IS GOING TO GET AND IT FEELS VERY REFINED
YOU1000000151_S0000112	I REMEMBER LIKING THE FIRST GENERATION X EIGHT IT WAS VERY WILLING AND I LOVE THIS CAR EVEN MORE
YOU1000000151_S0000113	THE THING ABOUT THE RIGHT FOR ME IS THAT I'M VERY IMPRESSED I RESPECT IT I JUST CAN'T FALL IN LOVE WITH IT
YOU1000000151_S0000115	IT'S LIKE MEETING A FRIEND OF YOURS GIRLFRIEND AND YOU RECOGNIZE THAT SHE'S HOT BUT FOR WHATEVER REASON SHE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING FOR YOU

YOU1000000153_S0000022	REALLY SPEND A LOT OF TIME OUTSIDE ENJOYING IT SO
YOU1000000153_S0000023	YEAH I THINK I WANTED SOMETHING THAT WOULD KIND OF SINK INTO THE BACKGROUND SO NOTHING THAT WOULD STAND OUT TOO MUCH AND I LIKE THE CEDAR THE NATURAL LOOK OF THAT AND I THINK WHILST IT CAN STILL SINK INTO THE BACKGROUND AND IT DOESN'T STAND OUT TOO MUCH IT'S REALLY QUITE STRIKING AND MODERN
YOU1000000153_S0000024	AND WE REALLY DID SPEND A LOT OF TIME WHEN WE WERE IN A BIGGER HOUSE WE SPENT A LOT MORE TIME IN OUR OUTDOOR AREA AS IT WAS SO WE KEPT THE SAME OUTDOOR AREA AND JUST MADE MADE A BIT MORE SPACE ESSENTIALLY THAN WHAT WE HAD THERE
YOU1000000153_S0000025	THAT'S IT SO ALL OF THE DECKING IS MODULAR SO GREG SPENT HOURS LABORING AWAY WITH ALLENWOOD AND EVERYTHING SO WE COULD KEEP THE THE COST DOWN AND MINIMIZE THAT FOOTPRINT ON ON EVERYTHING AS WELL SO
YOU1000000153_S0000026	WE'VE DONE THAT SO IF WE EVER NEED A MOVE WE CAN PULL IT ALL APART IT WOULD BE A DIFFICULT TASK IT WOULDN'T BE SIMPLE BUT IT CAN BE DONE AND WE CAN TAKE IT TO OUR NEXT PARKING SPOT
YOU1000000153_S0000027	REALLY GOOD SIZED WATER TANK HERE AS WELL
YOU1000000153_S0000028	YEAH SO I THINK WATER WAS KEY WE MANAGED TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE DROUGHT PERIOD THAT WE WERE HERE ONLY JUST BEFORE WE GOT ALL THAT DOWNPOUR WHICH WAS GREAT BUT HAVING THE TWO KIDS AND US WE REALLY NEEDED A LARGE TANK SO WE HAVE GONE WITH A TEN THOUSAND LITER TANK THERE
YOU1000000153_S0000029	COLOR SO IT WASN'T PLASTIC WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR THE QUALITY OF WATER FOR US AND IT TIES IN REALLY NICELY WITH THE DESIGN OF THE HOUSE SO THAT WAS A BONUS
YOU1000000153_S0000030	AND NOW MOST OF THE TIME YOU LIVE HERE BY YOURSELVES BUT GREG SOMETIMES YOU HAVE YOUR KIDS OVER AS WELL DON'T YOU
YOU1000000153_S0000031	YES EVERY SECOND WEEK FOR FIVE DAYS WE HAVE THEM MY SON WHO'S TURNING THIRTEEN THIS YEAR AND MY DAUGHTER WHO IS TEN WE THOUGHT THEY'D HAVE A BIT OF TROUBLE ADAPTING TO IT BUT IT WAS HONESTLY VERY SMOOTH WHEN WE INTRODUCE THEM TO THE HOUSE THEY GOT EXCITED AND THEN

YOU1000000153_S0000042	YEAH COMFORT WAS THE MAIN GOAL WITH THIS SO WE FOUND THAT IN OUR REGULAR SIZED HOUSE WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THE LOUNGE ROOM ON THE COUCH WATCHING MOVIES PLAYING GAMES WITH THE KIDS SO WE NEEDED A COUCH THAT COULD ACCOMMODATE ALL FOUR OF US
YOU1000000153_S0000043	AND BE COMFORTABLE SO WE DESIGNED THE LAYOUT ACTUALLY OF THE LOUNGE ROOM BASED OFF THE SIZES OF THIS COUCH SO THE CHASE DOES DOUBLE AS STORAGE WHICH IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT IN YOUR TINY HOUSE
YOU1000000153_S0000045	THE BED OBVIOUSLY PULLS OUT FROM UNDER THERE AS WELL WHICH IS GREAT TO HAVE THAT EXTRA SLEEPING SPACE IF YOU NEED IT
YOU1000000153_S0000046	WE ACTUALLY FIND THAT WE SPREAD THAT OUT MORE OFTEN THAN YEAH WE HAVE MORE FAMILY TIME REALLY WE SPEND MORE TIME WITH IT OUT JUST HANGING OUT LIKE THAT RATHER THAN JUST IN THIS L SHAPED COUCH

YOU1000000153_S0000057	YES SO WE DO A LOT OF MEAL PREPPING SO WE THOUGHT WE WOULD LIKE A BIG BENCH I THINK THAT WAS KEY FOR US BECAUSE WE DO THE MEAL PREPPING TOGETHER SO WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER IN THIS SPACE AT ONE TIME AND THEN IT ALSO DOUBLES AS A GREAT SPACE TO BE ABLE TO WORK AND HAVE OUR FOOD AS WELL
YOU1000000153_S0000058	STUDY SPACE SO ORIGINALLY WE MADE SURE THAT THIS BENCH SPACE THAT IS AT THE END HERE WAS MAINLY JUST SO THAT WE COULD DO WORK OR STUDY THERE AS WELL SO WE'VE GOT SPACE TO DO IT
YOU1000000153_S0000059	YEAH AND WE ALSO WANT TO HAVE A LOT OF OVERHEAD COVERED SPACE THERE AS WELL FOR STORAGE AND TO KEEP IT NICE AND TIDY RATHER THAN AN OPEN SHELVING JUST BECAUSE IT GETS QUITE DUSTY OUT HERE IN THE BUSH AREA

YOU1000000155_S0000000	REAL ESTATE INVESTING RULES OF THUMB THE TWO PERCENT RULE THE FIFTY PERCENT RULE AND THE SEVENTY PERCENT RULE
YOU1000000155_S0000001	THERE ARE SOME RULES OF THUMB THAT CAN HELP INVESTORS QUICKLY SCREEN THROUGH DEALS TO MAKE A GOOD EDUCATED GUESS ON WHETHER OR NOT TO PURSUE THEM
YOU1000000155_S0000002	NOW THIS IS IMPORTANT NOTICE THAT I DIDN'T SAY THERE ARE SOME RULES OF THUMB THAT CAN HELP INVESTORS MAKE PURCHASE DECISIONS
YOU1000000155_S0000003	BECAUSE RULES OF THUMB ARE NOT MEANT TO BE HARD AND FAST RULES THEY SIMPLY HELP AN INVESTOR GET A QUICK AND DIRTY OPINION ON SOME VALUABLE METRICS
YOU1000000155_S0000004	ALWAYS DO A PROPER ANALYSIS BUT REGARDLESS THESE RULES OF THUMB CAN COME IN REALLY HANDY IN SAVING YOU FROM ANALYZING EVERY SINGLE DEAL THAT YOU COME ACROSS
YOU1000000155_S0000005	MY NAME IS BRIAN TURNER AND IN THIS VIDEO I'VE OUTLINED SEVERAL OF THE MOST COMMON REAL ESTATE MATH RULES OF THUMB
YOU1000000155_S0000006	SO YOU CAN BEGIN PRACTICING THEM IN YOUR OWN ANALYSIS OF PROPERTIES
YOU1000000155_S0000008	FIRST THE TWO PERCENT RULE ALSO KNOWN AS THE ONE PERCENT RULE OR THE TWO PERCENT TEST
YOU1000000155_S0000009	PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON RULES OF THUMB USED BY RENTAL PROPERTY INVESTORS IS KNOWN AS THE TWO PERCENT RULE
YOU1000000155_S0000010	BUT NOT BECAUSE IT'S A RULE SO I SAY TWO PERCENT TEST I LIKE THAT BETTER
YOU1000000155_S0000011	ESSENTIALLY THIS RULE OF THUMB LOOKS AT THE MONTHLY RENT DIVIDED BY THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY IN A PERCENTAGE FORM
YOU1000000155_S0000012	FOR THOSE WHO JUST GOT CONFUSED LET'S MAKE THIS SUPER SIMPLE IF A PROPERTY RENTS FOR TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH
YOU1000000155_S0000013	AND THE VALUE IS TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THAN TWO THOUSAND DIVIDED BY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND EQUALS ONE PERCENT
YOU1000000155_S0000014	IN THIS EXAMPLE THE PROPERTY DOES NOT PASS THE TWO PERCENT TEST BUT IT DOES MEET THE ONE PERCENT TEST EXACTLY
YOU1000000155_S0000015	OR WHAT IF A PROPERTY THAT RENTS FOR FIFTEEN HUNDRED A MONTH AND IT COSTS A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND TO BUY WELL FIFTEEN HUNDRED DIVIDED BY A HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND IS POINT EIGHT PERCENT
YOU1000000155_S0000016	THAT'S DEFINITELY SHORT OF THE ONE PERCENT RULE OR ONE PERCENT TEST NOW WHAT IF THAT PROPERTY RENTS FOR FIFTEEN HUNDRED A MONTH BUT IT'S WORTH A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THUS
YOU1000000155_S0000017	WELL FIFTEEN HUNDRED DIVIDED BY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND EQUALS ONE POINT TWO FIVE PERCENT ALL RIGHT SO YOU GET HOW THE MATH WORKS NOW RIGHT BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN
YOU1000000155_S0000018	WELL ESSENTIALLY THE ONE PERCENT OR TWO PERCENT TEST GIVES US A QUICK AND DIRTY VIEW ON WHETHER OR NOT THE PROPERTY WILL PRODUCE POSITIVE CASH FLOW
YOU1000000155_S0000019	AND OF COURSE JUST RULE OF THUMB ISN'T ALWAYS PRECISE BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING THE HIGHER THE PERCENTAGE THE BETTER THE CASH FLOW
YOU1000000155_S0000020	THIS ALSO GREATLY DEPENDS ON LOCATION PRICE AND HOW MUCH THE EXPENSES TRULY ARE ON THE PROPERTY
YOU1000000155_S0000021	THE RULE OF THUMB CAN HELP AN INVESTOR MAKE SOME DECISIONS ON WHETHER OR NOT TO PURSUE A CERTAIN PROPERTY
YOU1000000155_S0000022	FOR EXAMPLE I KNOW THAT MOST PROPERTIES THAT FALL SHORT OF ONE PERCENT WILL LIKELY NEVER PRODUCE A POSITIVE CASH FLOW FOR ME
YOU1000000155_S0000023	IF IT'S BETWEEN ONE AND TWO PERCENT IT PROBABLY WILL AND IF IT'S ABOVE TWO PERCENT WHICH IS REALLY HARD TO FIND TODAY THEN I'M ALMOST POSITIVE THAT IT WILL
YOU1000000155_S0000024	SO IF MY REAL ESTATE AGENT TELLS ME THAT THEY HAVE A PERFECT RENTAL HOUSE FOR ME TO BUY AND I SEE THAT THE PURCHASE PRICE IS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND
YOU1000000155_S0000025	AND I FIND THAT RENT FOR A THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH I CAN MAKE A VERY QUICK DECISION AND I KNOW THAT MOST LIKELY THAT DEAL AIN'T GONNA EVER PROVIDE CASH FLOW
YOU1000000155_S0000026	BECAUSE IT FALLS SHORT OF THE ONE PERCENT RULE BECAUSE A THOUSAND DIVIDED BY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND EQUALS POINT EIGHT PERCENT
YOU1000000155_S0000027	IN A CASE LIKE THIS I PROBABLY WOULDN'T EVEN SPEND ANY MORE TIME LOOKING AT THE DEAL IF I WAS ONLY INTERESTED IN THE CASHFLOW
YOU1000000155_S0000028	SO THAT'S THE VALUE OF THE TWO PERCENT RULE TEST THING WHILE THE TWO PERCENT RULE AND THE ONE PERCENT RULE OR TEST WE JUST MENTIONED
YOU1000000155_S0000029	THEY CAN HELP YOU WITH LIKE GO NO GO DECISION ON LOOKING FURTHER INTO A RENTAL PROPERTY
YOU1000000155_S0000030	IT DOESN'T REALLY TELL US HOW MUCH CASH FLOW WE MIGHT EXPECT FOR THAT INVESTORS OFTEN RELY ON THE FIFTY PERCENT RULE OF THUMB
YOU1000000155_S0000031	THE FIFTY PERCENT RULE STATES THAT ON AVERAGE AND OVERTIME HALF OF THE INCOME IN A PROPERTY IS SPENT ON OPERATING EXPENSES
YOU1000000155_S0000032	NOW WHAT ARE OPERATING EXPENSES WELL GOOD QUESTION OPERATING EXPENSES ARE ALL OF THE EXPENSES INVOLVED WITH RUNNING A RENTAL PROPERTY
YOU1000000155_S0000033	EXCEPT THE LOAN PAYMENT SO IT INCLUDES TAXES INSURANCE UTILITIES REPAIRS VACANCY AND OTHER METRICS
YOU1000000155_S0000034	THAT LEAVE THE LANDLORD'S CHECKING ACCOUNT EVERY SINGLE MONTH OR EVERY YEAR DEPENDS ON HOW YOU WANT TO LOOK AT IT
YOU1000000155_S0000035	THE FIFTY PERCENT RULE CAN HELP AN INVESTOR QUICKLY ESTIMATE THE CASHFLOW OF A RENTAL PROPERTY BECAUSE IT COMBINES ALL OF THOSE EXPENSES EXCEPT FOR THE LOAN INTO ONE EASY NUMBER
YOU1000000155_S0000037	SO LET'S WORK THROUGH THIS IMAGINE A PROPERTY RENT FOR TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH THE FIFTY PERCENT RULE SAYS HALF OF THIS A THOUSAND WILL BE SPENT ON EXPENSES
YOU1000000155_S0000038	THIS MEANS WE'RE LEFT WITH A THOUSAND BUCKS BUT NOW WE NEED TO MAKE THE MORTGAGE PAYMENT ON THIS RIGHT UNLESS YOU PAID CASH FOR THE PROPERTY BUT LET'S SAY YOU DIDN'T
YOU1000000155_S0000039	SO WITH THAT THOUSAND DOLLARS WE HAVE LEFT LET'S SAY THE MORTGAGE IS SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS SO HOW MUCH DO YOU HAVE LEFT FOUR HUNDRED BUCKS
YOU1000000155_S0000040	BECAUSE TWO THOUSAND TIMES FIFTY PERCENT EQUALS A THOUSAND A THOUSAND MINUS SIX HUNDRED FOR OPERATING EXPENSES IS FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS IN CASH FLOW
YOU1000000155_S0000041	THAT REMAINING NUMBER IS WHAT YOU CAN ESTIMATE OVER TIME ON AVERAGE YOU MIGHT GET IN MONTHLY CASH FLOW
YOU1000000155_S0000042	OF COURSE THAT FIFTY PERCENT ESTIMATE ON OPERATING EXPENSES CAN REALLY VARY WIDELY DEPENDING ON THE PROPERTY
YOU1000000155_S0000043	IN SOME AREAS TAXES AND INSURANCE MIGHT BE INCREDIBLY HIGH BUT IN OTHER AREAS IT MIGHT BE MUCH LOWER SOME PROPERTIES REQUIRE THAT THE LANDLORD PAY ALL THE UTILITIES
YOU1000000155_S0000044	WHERE OTHER PROPERTIES ALLOW THE TENANT TO PAY THEIR OWN AND WHILE INHERENT WEAKNESSES DO EXIST
YOU1000000155_S0000045	THE FIFTY PERCENT RULE DOES HAVE VALUE I MEAN WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT A PROPERTY THAT RENTS FOR TWELVE HUNDRED BUCKS A MONTH
YOU1000000155_S0000047	AND YOU KNOW THE MORTGAGE PAYMENT WOULD BE AROUND A THOUSAND YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH GUARANTEE THAT PROPERTY WILL NOT PRODUCE A POSITIVE CASH FLOW
YOU1000000155_S0000048	TWO HUNDRED BUCKS A MONTH IS NOT A LOT OF ROOM FOR ALL THOSE EXPENSES BECAUSE TWELVE HUNDRED TIMES FIFTY PERCENT EQUALS SIX HUNDRED
YOU1000000155_S0000049	SIX HUNDRED MINUS A THOUSAND IS NEGATIVE FOUR HUNDRED RIGHT NOW THE FIFTY PERCENT RULE HELPS KEEP REAL ESTATE INVESTORS IN CHECK
YOU1000000155_S0000050	AND TO REMIND US THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF EXPENSES THAT OVERTIME ADD UP YEAH I MEAN A NEW ROOF IS ONLY NEEDED EVERY TWENTY YEARS
YOU1000000155_S0000051	BUT IF YOU DIVIDE A TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ROOF INTO TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY MONTHS THAT ROOF IS ACTUALLY COSTING YOU FORTY TWO BUCKS A MONTH EVERY SINGLE MONTH
YOU1000000155_S0000052	THESE OPERATING EXPENSES ADD UP OVER TIME AND AS MOST INVESTORS HAVE SEEN THEY TEND TO SETTLE AROUND FIFTY PERCENT GIVING A LONG ENOUGH TIME FRAME
YOU1000000155_S0000053	OKAY ON TO THE FINAL RULE OF THUMB TODAY THE SEVENTY PERCENT RULE
YOU1000000155_S0000054	THE LAST COUPLE RULES OF THUMB THAT WE TALKED ABOUT WERE DESIGNED TO HELP RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS BUT WHAT ABOUT THE HOUSE FLIPPERS THE WHOLESALERS I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE YOU GUYS OUT
YOU1000000155_S0000055	SO FOR THOSE WHO ARE FLIPPING HOUSES THE SEVENTY PERCENT RULE CAN BE HELPFUL IN DETERMINING JUST HOW MUCH TO PAY FOR PROPERTY
YOU1000000155_S0000056	THE SEVENTY PERCENT RULE STATES THAT THE MOST YOU SHOULD PAY FOR A POTENTIAL FLIP IS SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE AFTER REPAIR VALUE LIKE WHAT IT WOULD SELL FOR WHEN IT WAS ALL FIXED UP
YOU1000000155_S0000057	MINUS THE REPAIR COSTS SO EXAMPLE IF A HOLE WOULD SELL FOR THREE HUNDRED GRAND ALL FIXED UP AND THE PROPERTY NEEDED FIFTY GRAND WORTH OF WORK TO GET THERE
YOU1000000155_S0000058	THEN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND TIMES SEVENTY PERCENT IS TWO HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND SUBTRACT OUT THAT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND YOU'RE LEFT WITH ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY K
YOU1000000155_S0000059	ACCORDING TO THE SEVENTY PERCENT RULE THE MOST SOMEONE SHOULD PAY FOR THAT PROPERTY WOULD BE A HUNDRED AND SIXTY K BUT OF COURSE THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH THE SEVENTY PERCENT RULE
YOU1000000155_S0000060	THIS RULE OF THUMB ASSUMES THAT THIRTY PERCENT OF THE ARV THE AFTER REPAIR VALUE IS GOING TO BE SPENT ON HOLDING COST ON CLOTHING COSTS ON THE BUYING SIDE THE SELLING SIDE
YOU1000000155_S0000061	COMMISSIONS TAXES ATTORNEY FEES TITLE COMPANY FEES AND MORE AND THE FLIPPERS PROFIT AND ANY OTHER CHARGES THAT COME UP DURING THE DEAL NOW THIS WORKS WELL IN SOME MARKETS
YOU1000000155_S0000062	BUT IT HAS SOME SEVERE LIMITATIONS
YOU1000000155_S0000063	FOR EXAMPLE THE SEVENTY PERCENT RULE DOESN'T REALLY WORK THAT WELL FOR A PROPERTY WITH A REALLY LOW AFTER REPAIR VALUE
YOU1000000155_S0000064	SUCH AS FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AS MENTIONED EARLIER THE THIRTY PERCENT DEDUCTED FROM THE INCLUDES THE HOLDING COSTS AND THE CLOSING COSTS AS WELL AS A PROFIT
YOU1000000155_S0000065	THE INVESTOR OR THE FLIPPER WANTS TO MAKE HOWEVER LIKE THIRTY PERCENT OF FIFTY GRAND IS LIKE FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS SO FOLLOWING THE SEVENTY PERCENT RULE
YOU1000000155_S0000066	ALL OF THE FEES COST AND PROFIT WOULD ONLY BE FIFTEEN GRAND
YOU1000000155_S0000067	IF THE FEES AND HOLDING COSTS WERE TO TOTAL LIKE TEN GRAND THAT WOULD LEAVE JUST FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN PROFIT FOR THE HOUSE FLIPPER
YOU1000000155_S0000068	AND I DON'T KNOW ANY HOUSE FLIPPER WHO'S GONNA TAKE ON THE RISK OF FLIPPING A HOUSE FOR JUST FIVE GRAND
YOU1000000155_S0000069	SO FOLLOWING THE SEVENTY PERCENT RULE A FLIPPER OR WHOLESALER WOULD PAY FAR TOO MUCH FOR THE PROPERTY IN THIS EXAMPLE
YOU1000000155_S0000070	AND INVESTOR FLIPPING HOUSES AT THIS LEVEL MIGHT REQUIRE FAR LESS THAN SEVENTY PERCENT MAYBE FIFTY PERCENT OR EVEN LOWER
YOU1000000155_S0000071	NOW A SIMILAR PROBLEM EXISTS WITH THE SEVENTY PERCENT RULE FOR MORE EXPENSIVE PROPERTIES
YOU1000000155_S0000072	THE SEVENTY PERCENT RULE WOULD DICTATE THAT A HOME WITH AN ARC OF SEVEN HUNDRED GRAND THAT NEEDS FIFTY GRAND TO WORK
YOU1000000155_S0000073	SHOULD PRODUCE A MAXIMUM OFFER OF FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND
YOU1000000155_S0000074	BUT IN MOST MARKETS FINDING A SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PROPERTY FOR FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND IS SIMPLY NOT FEASIBLE
YOU1000000155_S0000075	A PERSON WHO STICKS EXCLUSIVELY TO THAT SEVENTY PERCENT RULE ARE LIKELY NEVER GOING TO FIND A GOOD ENOUGH DEAL TO EVER FLIP A SINGLE PROPERTY IN THAT MARKET
YOU1000000155_S0000076	IN THIS CASE EIGHTY PERCENT OR EVEN EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT MIGHT BE GOOD ENOUGH
YOU1000000155_S0000077	FURTHERMORE SOME INVESTORS MAY SPEND MORE OR LESS ON FEES AND COSTS BECAUSE OF THEIR PARTICULAR LIFE SITUATION OR LOCATION
YOU1000000155_S0000078	FOR EXAMPLE IN SOME STATES PURCHASING A HOME MAY REQUIRE THREE GRAND AND CLOTHING COSTS WHILE IN OTHER STATES IT MIGHT BE SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS
YOU1000000155_S0000079	SOME INVESTORS MAY HAVE A REAL ESTATE LICENSE WHICH SAVES THEM TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN COMMISSIONS
YOU1000000155_S0000080	WHEREAS OTHER INVESTORS WELL THEY MAY NEED TO PAY COMMISSIONS WHEN THEY ACTUALLY SELL THE PROPERTY SO HOW SHOULD THE SEVENTY PERCENT RULE BE VALUED
YOU1000000155_S0000081	CAREFULLY IT'S A QUICK AND DIRTY WAY TO ESTIMATE THE APPROXIMATE AMOUNT YOU SHOULD PAY FOR A PROPERTY
YOU1000000155_S0000082	BUT AS WITH ALL RULES OF THUMB NO CONCRETE DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE UNLESS YOU'VE RUN A REAL ESTATE ANALYSIS ON THE PROPERTY
YOU1000000155_S0000083	AND OF COURSE IF YOU WANT TO DO THAT CHECK OUT THE BIGGERPOCKETS SET OF CALCULATORS YOU CAN GET THEM AT BIGGERPOCKETS DOT COM FORWARD SLASH TALK CALC

YOU1000000160_S0000008	SO IF YOUR PARENTS ARE BINGE WATCHING NETFLIX WHILE YOUR LITTLE SISTER JIMS OUT TO SPOTIFY YOU COULD EASILY FIND YOURSELF PLAYING A GAME AT SEVEN TWENTY WITH STEREO SOUND INSTEAD OF BEING MAXED OUT AT FOUR K GRAPHICS WITH HD VIDEO AND FIVE POINT ONE SURROUND SOUND
YOU1000000160_S0000009	THE FIVE AND XBOX TWO WILL RELY ON DISCS AND DOWNLOADS TO PROVIDE A CONSISTENT QUALITY FOR A LOT OF THE GAMES
YOU1000000160_S0000010	BESIDES THE FOUR K QUALITY EACH OF THE THREE CONSOLES ALSO AIMED TO PROVIDE SIXTY FRAMES PER SECOND AS A STANDARD FOR A MAJORITY OF THE GAME
YOU1000000160_S0000011	IN SIMPLE TERMS CHARACTER MOVEMENTS ARE GOING TO LOOK INCREDIBLY SMOOTH THINGS LIKE CAR RACES ARE GOING TO BE FLUID AND ALL THOSE FIRST PERSON SHOOTERS WILL BE EVEN BETTER THAN YOU COULD IMAGINE
YOU1000000160_S0000012	ANOTHER WAY THESE CONSOLES ARE ALL IMPROVING ON THE GRAPHICAL PRESENTATION WITH RAY TRACING
YOU1000000160_S0000013	THE LIGHTING TECHNIQUE INCLUDES EXTREMELY VIVID GRAPHICS AND WILL MAKE EVERYTHING FROM REFLECTIONS TO SHADOWS LOOK EVEN MORE REALISTIC THAN THEY ALREADY ARE
YOU1000000160_S0000014	ALL IN ALL EACH CONSOLE IS PRETTY MUCH ON PAR WITH EACH OTHER AND THE GRAPHICS DEPARTMENT WITH THE FIVE AND XBOX TWO TAKING A SLIGHT EDGE BECAUSE OF STADIUMS RELIANCE ON PROPER INTERNET SPEEDS

YOU1000000160_S0000017	ONE OF THE BIGGEST FEATURES IS A MAJOR UPGRADE IN THE RUMBLE TECHNOLOGY AND THE ADAPTIVE NATURE OF THE ANALOGUE STACK
YOU1000000160_S0000018	NO LONGER WILL THE CONTROLLER JUST PLAY OUT A RANDOM RUMBLE OR BUZZ WHILE YOU PLAY
YOU1000000160_S0000019	EVERYTHING REACTS TO THE SURROUNDINGS YOU'RE IN IF YOU'RE AN UNDERCOVER AGENT WHO MUST CLIMB THEIR WAY THROUGH A SNOWY MOUNTAIN SIDE YOU'LL FEEL THE STRUGGLE OF EACH FOOTSTEP AS YOU MOVE THE ANALOG STICK AROUND

YOU1000000160_S0000021	ON TOP OF THAT THE TRIGGER BUTTONS ON TOP OF THE NEWEST DUEL SHOT CONTROLLER ARE MORE SENSITIVE THAN EVER
YOU1000000160_S0000022	BLASTING YOUR WAY THROUGH LEVELS WITH A LASER GUN WILL FEEL VERY DIFFERENT THAN PLAYING AS BATMAN AND THROWING A BATTERING AND THE PRESSURE YOU PLACE ON THE TRIGGER WILL INDICATE THE SPEED AND FORCE RATHER THAN JUST BUTTON MASHING

YOU1000000160_S0000024	IF THE DUAL SHOT CONTROLLER WORKS WITHOUT ANY MAJOR PROBLEMS OR GLITCHES THEN THE P FIVE EDGES OUT THE COMPETITION FOR THE INNOVATIVE NATURE OF THEIR DESIGN
YOU1000000160_S0000025	CLOUD GAME SERVICES AND SPEAKING OF CLOUD BASED GAMING GOOGLE STADIA IS NOT THE ONLY ONE PROVIDING THIS STREAMING SERVICE

YOU1000000161_S0000260	THIS IS THE MOMENT RIGHT NOW WHERE WE EACH SELECT OUR FAVORITE OUT OF THE BUNCH I MEAN WE JUST UNBOXED EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT JORDANS HERE
YOU1000000161_S0000261	WHO BETTER THAN US TO TELL YOU WHICH IS THE BEST YOU GO FIRST
YOU1000000161_S0000262	OKAY MICHAEL JORDAN WON IT'S THE BEGINNING I JUST LOVE THIS SHOW AND ADULT SIZE
YOU1000000161_S0000263	IT'S A GREAT SHOW IT'S A CLASSIC LOOK I SEE WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM THE FUNNY THING ABOUT THIS ENTIRE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THE LESS DESIRABLE SHOES HAVE BEEN THE HARDEST TO FIND
YOU1000000161_S0000264	THE COLLECTING PART OF IT IS ONLY HALF THE THING LIKE SOME PEOPLE WANT TO WEAR THIS HISTORY
YOU1000000161_S0000265	FOR ME THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THIS PACKAGE RIGHT HERE WHICH JUST SCREAMS OF A VERY PARTICULAR ERA
YOU1000000161_S0000266	THIS GIVES ME POSITIVE VIBES THERE'S A CONFIDENCE HERE THIS IS ICONIC TO ME
YOU1000000161_S0000267	THEY ALL ARE IN A WAY
YOU1000000161_S0000268	THEY ALL ARE AND THAT'S UP THERE TOO OUT OF THE DESTRUCTION OF THAT TIME PERIOD THIS EMERGED
YOU1000000161_S0000269	
YOU1000000161_S0000271	SO THERE YOU HAVE IT EVERY GAME WARN JORDAN UNBOXED HERE THANKS TO MY FRIEND BRAD HALL
YOU1000000161_S0000272	THANK YOU THIS IS FUN
YOU1000000162_S0000000	SO I MADE THAT VIDEO RECENTLY ABOUT THE APPLE AIRPODS THEY CAME BACK INTO MY LIFE I'VE BEEN USING THE AIRPODS AND KIND OF ENJOYING
YOU1000000162_S0000002	THEY'RE WILDLY SUCCESSFUL YOU SEE THEM OUT IN THE WORLD OTHER MANUFACTURERS THEY'RE ENTERING THE SPACE
YOU1000000162_S0000003	THIS IS THE LATEST INCARNATION OF THE FULLY WIRELESS SAMSUNG EARBUD PRODUCT
YOU1000000162_S0000004	HAS A COUPLE OF FEATURES THAT HAVEN'T BEEN SEEN BEFORE PROBABLY MY FAVORITE ONE IS THE FACT THAT THIS ENTIRE SETUP
YOU1000000162_S0000005	CHARGE FROM ANY PHONE THAT SUPPORTS WIRELESS CHARGE SHARING BECAUSE THIS IS A SAMSUNG PRODUCT AND THIS IS A SAMSUNG PHONE
YOU1000000162_S0000006	THERE'S ALSO SOME INTERPLAY THERE THAT'S A BIT SMOOTHER THAN IT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE WITH A THIRD PARTY PAIR OF EARBUDS EARBUDS
YOU1000000162_S0000007	BUT ONCE YOU'RE INTO THE APP THIS IS WHERE I THINK THEY HAVE A BIT OF AN ADVANTAGE OVER THE AIRPODS THEY'RE SUPER CONFIGURABLE
YOU1000000162_S0000008	HERE WE CAN SEE THE BATTERY LIFE OF EACH INDIVIDUAL UNIT YOU CAN USE ONE INDEPENDENTLY OF THE OTHER
YOU1000000162_S0000009	YOU CAN KEEP ONE OF THESE GUYS CHARGING IN THE CASE WHILE LISTENING TO THE OTHER ONE
YOU1000000162_S0000010	THERE'S SOME DIFFERENT EQUALIZER SETTINGS HERE FOR BASE BOOST SOFT DYNAMIC CLEAR AND SO ON
YOU1000000162_S0000011	YOU CAN MANAGE HOW THESE THINGS DEAL WITH NOTIFICATIONS THEY DO HAVE TOUCH PADS ON THE SIDE UNLIKE THE AIRPODS
YOU1000000162_S0000012	THESE HAVE INTERCHANGEABLE EAR TIPS AND EAR HOOKS AS WELL LOOK AT ALL THOSE OPTIONS
YOU1000000162_S0000013	THE AIRPOD YOU'VE SEEN IT BEFORE DOESN'T FIT THAT FAR INTO THE EAR CANAL FOR SOME PEOPLE THIS FITS REALLY WELL OTHERS IT WON'T STAY IN THEIR EARS
YOU1000000162_S0000014	THESE ON THE OTHER HAND ARE GOING TO BE A BIT MORE PREDICTABLE BECAUSE THEY SIT FURTHER IN THE EAR CANAL AND THEY HAVE THAT SECONDARY RUBBER PLASTIC COMPONENT
YOU1000000162_S0000015	SHOULD JUST BE A BIT MORE SECURE AND THEY'RE CONSIDERING THE WAY THAT THEY'RE DESIGNED
YOU1000000162_S0000016	AIRPOD IS A BIT TALLER BUT ALSO SLIGHTLY LESS CHUNKY THAN THE GALAXY BUT
YOU1000000162_S0000017	SO PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW HEY WHICH ONE SHOULD I GET CONSIDERING THAT YOU CAN USE EITHER ON MULTIPLE PLATFORMS
YOU1000000162_S0000018	WORK AS BLUETOOTH HEADSETS YOU COULD USE THE AIRPODS ON ANDROID YOU COULD USE THE GALAXY BUDS ON IOS
YOU1000000162_S0000019	WITHIN THE APP THERE'S ALSO FIND MY EARBUDS BUTTON SO THAT WILL TRACK THESE DOWN THESE THINGS COULD BE PRETTY EASY TO LOSE I MEAN THEY ARE TINY
YOU1000000162_S0000020	ALSO THERE'S A PRETTY COOL AMBIENT SOUND OPTION I CAN ACTUALLY ELEVATE THE VOLUME OF THE AMBIENT SOUND THE SOUND AROUND ME
YOU1000000162_S0000021	SO IT'LL BE AMPLIFIED INTO MY EAR SO I CAN HEAR MY SURROUNDINGS WHILE I'M LISTENING TO MUSIC PODCASTS AUDIOBOOKS AND SO
YOU1000000162_S0000022	NOW YOU CAN TOGGLE THAT ALL THE WAY DOWN SO THAT IT'S MUTED WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND ME IS MUTED
YOU1000000162_S0000023	YOU CAN HAVE AMBIENT IF YOU'RE ON A BIKE YOU'RE CYCLING YOU NEED TO HEAR IF IF A CAR HONKS ITS HORN OR SOMETHING THIS CAN REALLY AMPLIFY YOUR SURROUNDINGS
YOU1000000162_S0000024	COURSE IT'S NOT ON THE AIRPODS THERE'S ALSO A VOICE FOCUS FEATURE IN THERE SO THIS LOOKS FOR VOICES SPECIFICALLY
YOU1000000162_S0000025	ALLOWS THEM TO CUT THROUGH THAT PARTICULAR FREQUENCY RANGE I FIND THIS TO BE USEFUL FROM TIME TO TIME
YOU1000000162_S0000026	NOW THE WAY THAT THE TOUCHPAD WORKS YOU CAN TAP TO PLAY OR PAUSE A TRACK DOUBLE TAP TO PLAY THE NEXT TRACK ANSWER OR END A PHONE CALL
YOU1000000162_S0000027	TRIPLE TAP TO PLAY THE PREVIOUS TRACK AND TOUCH AND HOLD TO USE A USER CONFIGURABLE USERS CHOICE
YOU1000000162_S0000028	YOU COULD HAVE THAT LAUNCH SOMETHING SPECIFICALLY DO SOMETHING SPECIFICALLY AND THAT'S USER CONFIGURABLE THAT'S NICE
YOU1000000162_S0000029	NOW THAT I HAVE IT FOR QUICK AMBIENT SOUND I'M GONNA TOUCH AND HOLD SEE IF I CAN LIGHTEN UP THE SURROUNDINGS HERE WE GO
YOU1000000162_S0000031	WOW THAT'S COOL IT TOGGLES AMBIENT MODE WHILE YOU'RE HOLDING YOUR FINGER ON THE TOUCHPAD I'M IN AMBIENT RIGHT NOW I CAN TOTALLY HEAR MY CONVERSATION HEAR MY OWN VOICE NOW DO I LOOK A LITTLE STRANGE DOING THIS QUITE POSSIBLY
YOU1000000162_S0000032	THE QUESTION YOU ALL HAVE IS LIKE HOW DO THEY STACK UP AGAINST THE AIRPODS NOW AS YOU GUYS KNOW I'M AN TEN USER THIS IS THE DEVICE THAT'S CURRENTLY IN MY POCKET
YOU1000000162_S0000033	SO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EITHER OF THESE EARBUDS IT HAS TO BE IN CORRELATION TO THIS PARTICULAR DEVICE
YOU1000000162_S0000034	WE TALKED ABOUT SOME ADVANTAGES WITHIN THE APP WHO KNOWS I MIGHT BE WILLING TO GIVE UP THOSE EXTRA FEATURES IN EXCHANGE FOR POTENTIALLY BETTER SOUND I'M NOT REALLY SURE WELL
YOU1000000162_S0000035	START WITH THE GALAXY BUDS I WANT TO MAKE SURE I'VE GOT MAXIMUM VOLUME OKAY SO NOW I KNOW I'VE GOT MAX VOLUME LITTLE SAMPLE
YOU1000000162_S0000036	
YOU1000000162_S0000038	
YOU1000000162_S0000040	WE'RE IN SOFT RIGHT NOW DYNAMIC CLEAR BASE
YOU1000000162_S0000042	
YOU1000000162_S0000044	OKAY I'M WONDERING RIGHT NOW IF THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE TESTED THESE ALREADY HAD THEM IN FULL VOLUME OR
YOU1000000162_S0000045	CAUSE I READ SOME OF THOSE THINGS THAT YOU READ AND THAT WAS THE EXPERIENCE I WAS HAVING UNTIL I MADE SURE THE BUDS THEMSELVES WERE MAX VOLUME AND THE PHONE WAS MAX VOLUME
YOU1000000162_S0000046	NOW IT'S A LOT MORE THUMP WAY MORE BASE ARE PEOPLE DOING IT WRONG
YOU1000000162_S0000048	IT'S A HEADPHONE I'M HEARING INSTRUMENTS I WAS GONE FOR A MINUTE DID THE TRICK SORT OF I'VE HEARD BETTER KIND OF FEEL LIKE I GOTTA DO THIS EXACT SAME TRACK RIGHT NOW ON THE AIRPOD
YOU1000000162_S0000049	RIGHT NOW WITHOUT FURTHER ADO HURRY HURRY WAY LESS ISOLATION I HEAR THE THE FAN ON THE CAMERA HERE WE GO BEGINNING
YOU1000000162_S0000050	YOU KNOW NEITHER BLOWING MY BRAINS OUT YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY I'VE TRIED SOME VERY EXPENSIVE HEADPHONES IN THIS SPOT IN THIS SEAT RIGHT HERE
YOU1000000162_S0000051	DO IT TOGETHER YOU AND I JACK KIRK AND WHOEVER ELSE HAPPENS TO BE BEHIND ME ON ANY GIVEN DAY THESE ARE TINY DENTAL FLOSS SITUATIONS LOOK AT THEM
YOU1000000162_S0000052	IN TERMS OF SOUND I THINK I CAN SAY BASED ON THAT QUICK LITTLE TEST RIGHT THERE THE BUT
YOU1000000162_S0000054	THERE'S A BIT MORE THUMP TO IT MAYBE MY EXPECTATIONS WERE TOO HIGH
YOU1000000162_S0000055	THEY'RE PROBABLY CLOSER TO THIS PERFORMANCE THAN THEY ARE TO LIKE A FULL ON PAIR OF HEADPHONES PERFORMANCE
YOU1000000162_S0000056	THAT SAID THE MOST STRIKING DIFFERENCE FOR ME BETWEEN THE TWO IS THE FIT THE AND THE FEEL
YOU1000000162_S0000057	AND THE SOUND SEAL WHEN YOU PUT THESE ON YOU FEEL ISOLATED BUT THERE'S A DRAWBACK TO THAT I NOTICED THEY'RE IN MY EARS A LITTLE BIT MORE
YOU1000000162_S0000058	THIS I DON'T EVEN FEEL IT THIS IS KIND OF A TIGHTER FEEL I HAD TO CHOOSE THIS IS A BIT MORE COMFORTABLE FOR MY PARTICULAR EAR CANAL
YOU1000000162_S0000059	THAT'S PART OF THE REASON I THINK I KEEP REACHING FOR THE AIRPODS IN THE FIRST PLACE NOT BECAUSE THEY SOUND THE BEST BUT BECAUSE YOU JUST DON'T EVEN NOTICE YOU'RE WEARING THEM THAT COULD BE A GOOD THING OR A BAD THING
YOU1000000162_S0000060	NEITHER ARE GOING TO BE AN AMAZING AUDIO EXPERIENCE BUT REALLY THESE PRODUCTS ARE ABOUT CONVENIENCE
YOU1000000162_S0000061	SO EVALUATING THEM ON CONVENIENCE YOU HAVE TO GIVE CERTAIN POINTS TO THE NEW SAMSUNG PRODUCT BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT IT CAN CHARGE WIRELESSLY AND OFF OF THE PHONE ITSELF
YOU1000000162_S0000062	ALSO THE APP GIVES YOU MORE CONFIGURABILITY ALSO ANOTHER THING WORTH NOTING THE GALAXY BUDS ARE A BIT CHEAPER THAN THE AIR
YOU1000000162_S0000063	THAT'S NOT MUCH OF A SURPRISE THAT IS A HARD PICK I REALLY DON'T KNOW I MEAN IT MIGHT BE SO SIMPLE AS IF YOU'RE ON ON SAMSUNG OR ON ANDROID YOU MIGHT GO FOR THESE
YOU1000000162_S0000064	YOU'RE ON IOS YOU'LL PROBABLY GO FOR THESE JUST FOR THE EASIER PAIRING ACROSS DEVICES
YOU1000000162_S0000065	IT'S A HARD DECISION I'D SAY IF I'M ABOUT TO DO SOME KIND OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IF I'M GOING FOR A JOG OR SOMETHING I DON'T JOG BUT LIKE LET'S SAY I DID
YOU1000000162_S0000066	I WILL PROBABLY REACH FOR THESE ONES THERE'S JUST A BIT MORE CONFIDENCE IN THE FIT BUT IF IT'S JUST IF IT'S IN AN ENVIRONMENT LIKE AROUND THE HOUSE
YOU1000000162_S0000067	I ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE THE IDEA OF NOT FEELING THE THING IN YOUR EAR AS STUPID AS THAT LOOKS YOU FORGET THAT IT'S THERE
YOU1000000162_S0000068	I ALREADY HAVE SO MANY GREAT SOUNDING HEADPHONES IF I WANT TO GET DOWN TO BUSINESS WITH MUSIC I THINK I'LL PROBABLY STILL REACH FOR THESE MORE BECAUSE OF THAT FACTOR
YOU1000000162_S0000069	AND THEN ALSO KEEP MY SON HEADPHONES THE DEDICATED OVER EAR HEADPHONES WITH THE NOISE CANCELLATION EVERYTHING ELSE
YOU1000000162_S0000070	KEEP THOSE FOR THE DISCERNING LISTENING BUT IF I DIDN'T HAVE THOSE OTHER HEADPHONES AND I NEEDED SOMETHING THAT COULD ISOLATE BETTER THAN THE AIRPODS
YOU1000000162_S0000071	I COULD ONLY HAVE ONE PAIR I ONLY HAD A HUNDRED AND THIRTY BUCKS FOR ONE PAIR I'D PROBABLY GO FOR THESE
YOU1000000162_S0000072	ONLY ONE PAIR OF HEADPHONES I PROBABLY WOULD CHOOSE THESE OVER THESE BUT IN CONJUNCTION WITH A REALLY NICE PAIR THAT YOU USE SOMETIMES
YOU1000000162_S0000073	THIS IS THE I DON'T EVEN NOTICE I'M WEARING THEM HEADSET THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE
YOU1000000163_S0000000	OKAY SO BACK IN DECEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE MADE A VIDEO ON ONE OF THE BEST OPTIONS IN TERMS OF SMART WATCHES FOR ANDROID USERS AND THAT WAS THIS WATCH THE MOVIE TAKE WATCH PRO

YOU1000000163_S0000016	AT MOST AND SMART WATCHES THE CHARGER HAS THOSE CHARGING PINS AND YOU HAVE TO LINE UP MANUALLY THE WATCH WITH THE PINS WHICH I REALLY DON'T LIKE
YOU1000000163_S0000017	NOW WITH THE TWO WHILE THE CHARGER DOES HAVE THOSE PINS THE CHARGER ITSELF IS ACTUALLY MAGNETIC SO IT AUTOMATICALLY LINES ITSELF UP
YOU1000000163_S0000018	WITH A WATCH OK SO WHO IS THE TICK WATCH FOR AND WHAT DOES IT DO AND IN THE END IS IT IS IT REALLY WORTH IT
YOU1000000163_S0000019	WELL STARTING OFF WITH WHO THIS IS FOR WHILE THE TICK WATCH PRO WAS MOB BOY'S HIGHEST AND SMARTWATCH MADE OUT OF STAINLESS STEEL AND WITH A THIRTY DAY BATTERY LIFE THE TWO WAS ACTUALLY MADE WITH FITNESS AND SWIMMING IN MIND
YOU1000000163_S0000020	OKAY SO IT HAS WEAKER SPEC THAN THE PRO BUT IT IS BETTER FOR SWIMMING AND FITNESS RIGHT
YOU1000000163_S0000021	WELL TO MY SURPRISE THE TWO ACTUALLY HAS THE EXACT SAME SPECS AS THE MORE EXPENSIVE WATCH PRO AND IN SOME CASES IT EVEN OFFERS MORE THAN THE PRO DOES
YOU1000000163_S0000022	FOR EXAMPLE EVEN THOUGH THE TWO DOES NOT OFFER THE SAME DUAL DISPLAY TECHNOLOGY AS THE PRO DOES IT DOES HAVE THE EXACT SAME DISPLAY THE MAIN DISPLAY AS THE PRO
YOU1000000163_S0000023	SO THIS IS A ONE POINT FOUR INCH AMALA DISPLAY AT FOUR HUNDRED BY FOUR HUNDRED PIXELS AND RESOLUTION WHICH AT THE MOMENT IS ACTUALLY THE HIGHEST RESOLUTION DISPLAY ON ANY ANDROID SMARTWATCH SO TEXT IS RAZOR SHARP ON THIS

YOU1000000163_S0000031	WE GET A QUALCOM SNAPDRAGON WERE TWENTY ONE HUNDRED PROCESSOR WHICH YES IT IS UNFORTUNATELY NOT THE NEWLY RELEASED THIRTY ONE HUNDRED PROCESSOR
YOU1000000163_S0000032	BUT CONCERNING ITS PRICE POINTS AND THE FACT THAT THERE ARE ALMOST NO SMARTWATCHES USING THE THIRTY ONE HUNDRED PROCESS YET
YOU1000000163_S0000033	ASIDE FROM JUST THREE WATCHES THE MONT BLANC SUMMIT TO THE FOSSIL GEN FOUR SPORT AND THE BLUE BUTTON TAB HORIZON SECOND GEN
YOU1000000163_S0000034	SO YEAH THE TWENTY ONE HUNDRED IS THE BEST YOU COULD ASK FOR AT THIS PRICE THE TWO ALSO COMES WITH FIVE HUNDRED AND TWELVE MEGABYTES OF RAM
YOU1000000163_S0000035	AS WELL AS FORTY GIGABYTES OF INTERNAL STORAGE SO ADD THIS TO THE TWENTY ONE HUNDRED PROCESSOR AND THE FOUR HUNDRED BY FOUR HUNDRED PIXEL ONE POINT FOUR INCH AMALA DISPLAY AND THERE YOU GO YOU HAVE FLAGSHIP LEVEL SPECS
YOU1000000163_S0000036	ON AN ANDROID SMARTWATCH AND SOMETHING THAT'S ACTUALLY PRICED EXTREMELY EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE
YOU1000000163_S0000037	AND PERFORMANCE WISE I PERSONALLY HAVEN'T HAD ANY ISSUES AT ALL WITH SO MENUS WERE FLUID RISK DETECTION HAPPENED IN PRETTY MUCH AN INSTANT
YOU1000000163_S0000038	APPS OPENED VERY QUICKLY AND ACTIVATING THE GOOGLE ASSISTANT WAS VERY FAST
YOU1000000163_S0000039	AS WELL SO YEAH PERFORMANCE WISE THE TWO GETS MY SEAL OF APPROVAL
YOU1000000163_S0000040	AND SINCE TWO COMES WITH GOOGLE'S OPERATING SYSTEM SO WE'RE TWO OUT OF THE BOX YOU GET THE EXACT SAME FEATURES AS YOU WOULD WITH ALL THE OTHER PREMIUM ADDRESS BAR WATCHES SO
YOU1000000163_S0000041	YOU GET ACCESS TO GOOGLE'S FULL PLAY STORE YOU GET ACCESS TO THOUSANDS OF THIRD PARTY WATCH FACES AND YOU CAN EVEN MAKE YOUR OWN
YOU1000000163_S0000042	IF YOU HAVEN'T FOUND ONE THAT YOU REALLY LIKE SO YEAH YOU CAN CREATE YOUR OWN CUSTOM WATCH FACES IF YOU CHOOSE TO DO SO SO I REALLY REALLY LIKE THIS FEATURE WHICH IS MISSING FROM YOU KNOW SOMETHING LIKE THE APPLE WATCH
YOU1000000163_S0000043	AND SPEAKING OF WATCH FACES THERE ARE THREE OF THEM THAT WERE MADE BY MOVE AND CAME PREINSTALLED ON THE TICK WATCH TOO AND I REALLY REALLY LOVE THE WAY THEY LOOK SO THEY HAVE THIS MINIMALISTIC LOOK
YOU1000000163_S0000044	WITH RED BLACK AND WHITE SO YEAH THEY'RE REALLY NICE NICELY DESIGNED AND I DO LOVE ALL OF THEM
YOU1000000163_S0000045	NAVIGATING THROUGH THE MENUS IS ALSO VERY EASY BY THE WAY AND INTUITIVE SO YOU SWIPE UP TO ACCESS YOUR NOTIFICATIONS YOU SWIPE DOWN TO ACCESS YOUR CONTROL TOGGLE FOR THINGS SUCH AS BRIGHTNESS
YOU1000000163_S0000046	LOW BATTERY MODE AIRPLANE MODE AND SO ON DO NOT DISTURB PRETTY MUCH JUST LIKE ON YOUR SMARTPHONE THEN YOU SWIPE RIGHT TO ACCESS THE GOOGLE ASSISTANT CARDS
YOU1000000163_S0000047	SO THINGS SUCH AS THE CURRENT WEATHER YOUR PLANE TICKETS YOUR LATEST NEWS ALL THAT WILL BE THERE SO YEAH VERY SIMILAR EXPERIENCE TO YOU KNOW GOOGLE NOW
YOU1000000163_S0000048	THEN YOU SWIPE LEFT YOU OPEN UP THE FITNESS PANEL THAT SHOWS YOU YOUR STEPS AND CALORIES THAT YOU'VE BURNED
YOU1000000163_S0000050	THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND TAPPING ON THIS ACTUALLY OPENS UP A DEDICATED TICK WATCH WORKOUT APP
YOU1000000163_S0000051	AND FINALLY PRESSING ON THE CROWN OPENS UP THE APP MENU SO THIS IS WHERE YOU CAN ACCESS YOUR THIRD PARTY APPS AND SYSTEM SETTINGS
YOU1000000163_S0000052	AND THEN HOLDING ON THE CROWN ACTIVATES THE GOOGLE ASSISTANT WHICH YOU CAN ALSO ACTIVATE BY USING YOUR VOICE BY YOU KNOW SAYING JUST THE COMMAND OKAY GOOGLE
YOU1000000163_S0000053	I'M NOT GONNA HOPEFULLY HAVEN'T ACTIVATED YOUR DEVICES BUT YEAH YOU CAN START ASKING QUESTIONS OR ASK FOR DIRECTIONS
YOU1000000163_S0000054	WETTER ALL THAT SO IT'S JUST LIKE USING GOOGLE ASSISTANT ON YOUR SMARTPHONE
YOU1000000163_S0000055	OKAY SO GREAT DISPLAY GREAT PERFORMANCE BUT WHAT DOES THE TO DO MORE OVER AUDITOR AND SMART WATCHES ASIDE FROM THE VERY LOW PRICE
YOU1000000163_S0000056	WELL MANY OTHER ANDROID SMART WATCHES TODAY ARE WATER RESISTANT FOR EXAMPLE TICK WATCH PRO WAS SIXTY EIGHT CERTIFIED SO UP TO ONE POINT FIVE METERS SUBMERSION UP TO THIRTY MINUTES
YOU1000000163_S0000057	BUT IS A BIT OF A SPECIAL ONE BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THE VERY VERY FEW SMART WATCHES THAT ARE ACTUALLY WATERPROOF NOT WATER RESISTANT BUT WATERPROOF
YOU1000000163_S0000058	SO THE TWO IS WATERPROOF UP TO FIVE ATMOSPHERES OF PRESSURE WHICH IS ABOUT FIFTY METERS OF DEATH
YOU1000000163_S0000059	SO SAME AS WOULD AN APPLE WATCH SERIES TWO OR NEWER YOU CAN TAKE THIS WITH YOU WHEN YOU'RE SWIMMING OR EVEN SNORKLING YES UP TO FIFTY METERS
YOU1000000163_S0000060	SO THAT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE ESPECIALLY AT THIS PRICE POINT AND TO EVEN COMES WITH ITS OWN BUILT IN EXERCISE APP THE WORKOUTS THAT I MENTIONED BEFORE
YOU1000000163_S0000061	WHICH DOES INCLUDE A SWIMMING MODE SO NOW YOU CAN TRACK YOUR PACE THE DURATION THE LAPSE AND EVEN THE NUMBER OF STROKES THAT YOU HAVE TAKEN
YOU1000000163_S0000062	IT ALSO FEATURES A BUILT IN GPS WHICH NOT A LOT OF SMART WATCHES DO BY THE WAY ESPECIALLY ESPECIALLY NOT AT THIS PRICE POINT
YOU1000000163_S0000063	SO IF YOU JUST WANT TO GO OUT FOR A RUN AND TAKE THE TWO WITH YOU THIS ONE IS PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF DOING THAT SO YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TRACK YOUR PATH EXACTLY WHERE YOU RUN YOUR RUNTIME
YOU1000000163_S0000064	YOUR HEART RATE AND SPEAKING OF HEART RATE TRACKING THE TWO NOW COMES WITH MOVIES HEART RATE MONITOR TWO POINT
YOU1000000163_S0000065	WHICH ACTUALLY MEASURES YOUR HEART RATE CONTINUOUSLY SO TWENTY FOUR SEVEN UNTIL OBVIOUSLY THE BATTERY DIES
YOU1000000163_S0000066	SO MOST MORE WATCHES ONLY MEASURE EVERY HOUR OR EVERY TEN MINUTES OR WHEN YOU'RE DOING A WORKOUT BUT CONSTANTLY MEASURES YOUR HEART RATE AND THEN SHOWS YOU GRAPHS ON HOW YOUR HEART RATE WAS AT DIFFERENT TIMES
YOU1000000163_S0000067	THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND SPEAKING OF THE BATTERY HOW IS IT WELL MOVE SAYS THAT THE TWO WOULD LAST YOU FOR UP TO FORTY EIGHT HOURS WHICH IS PRETTY GOOD NOW PERSONALLY
YOU1000000163_S0000068	IT LASTED ME FOR ABOUT A DAY A DAY AND A HALF BUT IT DOES DEPEND ON HOW YOU USE IT AND WHAT EXACTLY YOU DO WITH YOUR WITH YOUR SMARTWATCH
YOU1000000163_S0000069	BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU GO OUT ON A RUN AND HAVE THE GPS ON AND YOU'RE ALSO TRACKING YOUR WORKOUT THEN THE BATTERY LIFE WOULD ONLY LAST YOU FOR A FEW HOURS AND THIS APPLIES TO ANY SMALL WATCH INCLUDING THE APPLE WATCH
YOU1000000163_S0000070	OKAY SO SO FAR SO GOOD THE TICK WATCH TWO SEEMS LIKE IT CANNOT EXIST AT ITS PRICE POINT
YOU1000000163_S0000071	SO WHAT'S THE CATCH WELL IT DOES NOT HAVE AN S SO IF YOU'RE INTO GOOGLE PAY THEN YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO USE GOOGLE PAY WITH THE TICK WATCH TOO
YOU1000000163_S0000072	AND THEN THE DESIGN IS INDEED QUITE CHUNKY SO IT'S QUITE IT'S QUITE A THICK SMARTWATCH
YOU1000000163_S0000073	BUT ASIDE FROM THESE TWO THINGS YOU GET A LARGE AMALA DISPLAY WITH NO NOT CUTOUTS YOU GET THE HIGHEST RESOLUTION DISPLAY ON ANY ANDROID WATCH YOU GET A QUALITY SNAPDRAGON WERE TWENTY ONE HUNDRED PROCESSOR
YOU1000000163_S0000074	FIVE HUNDRED TWELVE MEGABYTES OF RAM AND FOUR GIGABYTES OF STORAGE SO ALL OF THESE ARE FLAGSHIP SPECS AND THE FACT THAT IT COMES WITH A TWENTY FOUR HOUR HEARTRATE MONITOR
YOU1000000163_S0000075	A FIFTY METER WATER RESISTANCE AND IT ONLY COSTS ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DOLLARS AT THE MOMENT SO IT MIGHT EVEN GET CHEAPER AS TIME GOES ON
YOU1000000163_S0000076	I HONESTLY THINK THAT THIS IS THE BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK IN TERMS OF ANY SMARTWATCH

YOU1000000166_S0000057	I'LL INSTEAD BE REFERRING TO THE YODA SPECIES AS THE TRIAL
YOU1000000166_S0000058	BECAUSE THEIR EXTREMITIES HAVE THREE DIGITS RIGHT BUT BEAR IN MIND THAT'S REALLY JUST A FAN MADE DESIGNATION FOR ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE YODA SPECIES THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY AWARE OF WHICH ARE JUST THREE
YOU1000000166_S0000059	HONESTLY YOU GOT ORIGINAL YODA YOU GOT ALL FROM THE PHANTOM MENACE WHO JUST APPEARS FOR A COUPLE SECONDS AND BABY YODA WHATEVER HIS NAME ENDS UP BEING FROM THE MANDATORY
YOU1000000166_S0000060	SO WITH THAT BIT OF HOUSEKEEPING OUT OF THE WAY AND WITH THE VERY SHORT LIST OF ACTUAL KNOWN MEMBERS OF THE YODA SPECIES WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT TRIAL
YOU1000000166_S0000061	WE KNOW THAT YODA LIVED TO THE RIPE OLD AGE OF NINE HUNDRED IN RETURN OF THE JEDI WHICH EVERYONE ELSE IS SURPRISED ABOUT BUT HE ISN'T SEEMING TO INDICATE THAT IT'S NOT REALLY THAT BIG OF A DEAL FOR
YOU1000000166_S0000062	BABY YODA WHO'S JUST STUCK WITH THAT NAME FOR THIS EPISODE I GUESS IS FIFTY BUT FUNCTIONALLY HE'S ABOUT A TEN MONTH OLD
YOU1000000166_S0000063	IF MY KID IS ANY INDICATION HE'S NON VERBAL BUT HE IS CAPABLE OF WALKING AND GETTING INTO TROUBLE SO WE KNOW
YOU1000000166_S0000064	AS A TRACTOR YOU GET NINE HUNDRED YEARS IN THE GALAXY ON THE HIGH END BUT AT LEAST
YOU1000000166_S0000066	FIRST FIFTY OF THEM ARE SPENT AS A BABY WHICH I GUESS LEAVES LIKE A HUNDRED TO MAKE IT THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL
YOU1000000166_S0000067	ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED YEARS OF LIVING IN YOUR PARENT'S BASEMENT BEFORE FINALLY GETTING YOUR OWN APARTMENT AT THE TENDER AGE OF THREE HUNDRED
YOU1000000166_S0000068	NOW BECAUSE WE'RE WORKING IN OUTER SPACE AND IN A FICTIONAL FRANCHISE IT'S WORTH DOUBLE CHECKING WHEN THEY SAY THAT BABY YODA IS FIFTY YEARS OLD IN THE MANDALORIAN
YOU1000000166_S0000069	DOES THAT TRANSLATE TO YEARS AS WE UNDERSTAND THEM HERE ON EARTH AND IT APPEARS LIKE IT DOES ACCORDING TO WIKIPEDIA THE REPUBLIC STANDARDIZED ITS TIME BASED ON CORISA
YOU1000000166_S0000070	WHICH CONVENIENTLY ROTATES ITS SUN EXACTLY ONCE EVERY THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE CORONATION DAYS WHICH ARE BROKEN DOWN THEMSELVES INTO TWENTY FOUR HOUR INCREMENTS
YOU1000000166_S0000071	AND THEN MINUTES THAT ARE INCREDIBLY CLOSE TO OUR OWN MINUTES SO WHEN ONE SAYS THAT HE'S NINE HUNDRED YEARS OLD IT'S PRETTY CLOSE TO WHAT WE THINK NINE HUNDRED YEARS IS
YOU1000000166_S0000072	AND THE MANDALORIAN HAS EVERY REASON TO BE SURPRISED THAT HIS FIFTY YEAR OLD MARK WAS STILL A BABY
YOU1000000166_S0000073	SO KNOWING THAT IT'S TIME TO TALK ABOUT THE BIOLOGY HAVING SUCH A LONG DEVELOPMENT PERIOD IS MORE THAN JUST AN INTERESTING EVOLUTIONARY QUIRK
YOU1000000166_S0000074	IT ACTUALLY TELLS US A LOT ABOUT HOW TRACTORS MAY HAVE EVOLVED OVER TIME MOSTLY BECAUSE IT PARALLELS A LOT OF OUR OWN HUMAN EVOLUTION
YOU1000000166_S0000075	YOU SEE MOST ANIMALS EVOLVE TO SHORTEN THE AMOUNT OF TIME BETWEEN BIRTH AND REPRODUCTIVE MATURITY SO THAT THEY CAN GO ON AND GROW THEIR POPULATION AS FAST AS POSSIBLE
YOU1000000166_S0000076	BUT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY SUCCESSFUL EVOLUTIONARY STRATEGY YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT US HUMANS HAVE INCREDIBLY LONG AND PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE CHILDHOOD
YOU1000000166_S0000077	WHEN A BABY GRAPH IS BORN IT CAN STAND ALMOST ALMOST ALMOST RIGHT AWAY THEY'RE SO CUTE HUMANS ON THE OTHER HAND NOT SO MUCH
YOU1000000166_S0000078	IT IS TAKING MONTHS IF NOT A YEAR FOR A BABY HUMAN TO ACTUALLY GET UP ON ITS FEET SO WHY DO HUMANS THE SMARTEST ANIMALS ON THE PLANET
YOU1000000166_S0000079	COME OUT SO USELESS
YOU1000000166_S0000080	WELL TURNS OUT THAT THE WHOLE ISSUE COMES DOWN TO OUR BRAINS YOU SEE OUR BRAIN HEADS AND THE FACT THAT THEY'RE SO FAT HAVE CHANGED OUR ENTIRE COURSE OF HUMAN EVOLUTION
YOU1000000166_S0000081	OUR ANCESTORS WHO MANY BELIEVE EMERGED FROM SUB SAHARAN AFRICA WERE AMONG THE FIRST SPECIES OF ANIMALS TO STOP WALKING AROUND ON FOUR LEGS
YOU1000000166_S0000082	START WALKING UP ON TO OUR BRAINS WERE BIG ENOUGH THAT WE WERE ABLE TO LOGIC OUT THE IDEA THAT IT TOOK LESS ENERGY TO WALK ON TWO LEGS
YOU1000000166_S0000083	I MINIMIZED OUR BALD SKINS EXPOSURE TO THE EXTREMELY HOT GROUND TEMPERATURES IN THOSE AFRICAN DESERT
YOU1000000166_S0000084	AS NEWLY BIPEDAL PEOPLE OUR EVOLUTION STARTED FAVORING OTHER MEMBERS OF OUR SPECIES WHO COULD ALSO WALK UPRIGHT GOOD FOR US NATURAL SELECTION AT ITS FINEST
YOU1000000166_S0000085	THERE'S ALWAYS A PRICE TO PAY FOR INNOVATION YOU SEE AS WE EVOLVE TO BE MORE AND MORE CAPABLE OF WALKING
YOU1000000166_S0000086	AND RUNNING AROUND ON TWO LEGS OUR BODIES EVOLVED TO FACILITATE THAT AND COMPENSATE FOR OUR CHANGED CENTER OF GRAVITY PRIMARILY DOING THIS BY NARROWING OUR HIPS
YOU1000000166_S0000087	THIS IN TURN HELPED US TO WALK UPRIGHT LIKE CAMPS BUT NOW OF A SUDDEN WE HAD A PROBLEM THAT BIG FAT HEAD OF OURS WAS LITERALLY TOO BIG TO BE BORN
YOU1000000166_S0000088	SURE WE HAD OURSELVES A BIG BRAIN BUT NOW THERE WAS NOWHERE FOR IT TO GO BECAUSE OUR HIPS WERE TOO NARROW TO ACCOMMODATE BEARING A HEAD THAT HUGE
YOU1000000166_S0000089	SO HUMAN EVOLUTION HAD TO CHANGE AGAIN AS THE THEORY GOES WE STARTED HAVING BABIES EARLIER IN THEIR GESTATIONAL PERIOD
YOU1000000166_S0000090	EARLIER AT A TIME WHEN THE BABY WAS STILL TINY AND SHY AND HELPLESS WHICH WOULD BE PRETTY DARN BAD FOR OUR SURVIVAL EXCEPT FOR ONE THING
YOU1000000166_S0000091	THE HEADS WERE STILL SMALL ENOUGH TO SQUEEZE UP ON OUT THERE STILL A VERY PAINFUL PROCESS BUT NOW AT LEAST IT WAS DOABLE
YOU1000000166_S0000092	AND THEN ONCE THE BABY WAS ON THE OTHER END THERE WOULD BE WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE FOURTH TRIMESTER
YOU1000000166_S0000093	AN EXTRA TRIMESTER OF DEVELOPMENT THAT HAPPENS OUTSIDE IN THE REAL WORLD WHERE WE AS PARENTS WOULD HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THAT HELPLESS NEWBORN
YOU1000000166_S0000094	BECAUSE TECHNICALLY IT STILL SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING IN THE WOMB IT JUST NEEDED TO BE YOU KNOW EVICTED FROM ITS HOME BEFORE IT WAS TOO BIG TO LEAVE ITS DOOR
YOU1000000166_S0000095	NOW LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT OUR FRIENDLY YODA WHAT FEATURES DO WE SEE WELL HE'S BIPEDAL HE'S SMALL WITH A DISPROPORTIONATELY HUGE HEAD FOR HIS HIGHLY EVOLVED BRAIN
YOU1000000166_S0000096	HE'S GOT A SHORT HIGHLY EFFICIENT BODY WITH DIMINUTIVE NARROW FEATURES INCLUDING HIS HIPS EVEN LOOKING AT THE BASIC CHARACTER MODEL
YOU1000000166_S0000097	YOU CAN SEE HOW IN ORDER TO PROCREATE THE TRACTORS WOULD HAVE TO HAVE THEMSELVES RADICALLY DIFFERENT PROPORTIONS
YOU1000000166_S0000098	CAN ALSO SEE HOW HAVING A BIG BRAIN IS A HUGE EVOLUTIONARY ADVANTAGE HUMANS ARE SO FAR AT THE TOP OF THE FOOD CHAIN THAT WE PROTECT OTHER MEMBERS OF THE FOOD CHAIN
YOU1000000166_S0000099	TRACTS IN THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE ARE THE WISEST AND MOST POWERFUL FORCE USERS IN THE GALAXY
YOU1000000166_S0000100	THE DOWNSIDE IS THAT THEY LIKE US ARE ESSENTIALLY BORN TOO EARLY HELPLESS FOR MONTHS IF NOT YEARS OR UNTIL AT LEAST THEIR DAD MAKES A PAY RENT
YOU1000000166_S0000101	THEIR MOM STOPS DOING THEIR LAUNDRY THIS THEORY CONTINUES TO HOLD WATER IF WE LOOK AT INFANCY FOR HUMANS VERSUS INFANCY FOR TRIALS IN THEIR FIRST TWO YEARS
YOU1000000166_S0000102	HUMAN BABY BRAINS GROW TO SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THEIR FULL ADULT SIZE WE DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS THE SAME FOR TRIAL
YOU1000000166_S0000103	BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THE PROPORTIONS OF HUMAN BABIES PARALLELED THE PROPORTIONS OF BABY YODA ENORMOUS HEAD ADORABLE TINY BODY
YOU1000000166_S0000104	BESIDES MAKING BABIES HILARIOUSLY TOP HEAVY THESE PROPORTIONS ALSO SERVE A FUNCTION IN INFANCY
YOU1000000166_S0000105	HUMAN BRAINS COMMAND UP TO EIGHTY SEVEN PERCENT OF THE TOTAL ENERGY THAT THE BODY USES AT REST
YOU1000000166_S0000106	MEANING THAT EVEN WHILE SLEEPING THE BODY IS DIVERTING A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF ENERGY TO GROWING THE BRAIN
YOU1000000166_S0000107	CAUSE THIS THE REST OF THE BABY'S GROWTH LAGS BEHIND THE HEAD WHERE THE BRAIN IS THIS ACCORDING TO THE EXPENSIVE TISSUE HYPOTHESIS
YOU1000000166_S0000108	WE CAN SEE THAT BABY YODA IS AN EXTREME VERSION OF THIS PRINCIPLE WITH A WILDLY HUGE AND MERCHANDISE ABLE HEAD
YOU1000000166_S0000109	AND A TEENY TINY BODY MAKING ME THINK THAT BABY YODA IS AN EXTREMELY EVOLVED VERSION OF WHAT THE HUMAN RACE COULD LOOK LIKE SOMEDAY
YOU1000000166_S0000111	PROCESS OF EVOLUTIONARILY ELONGATING THE DEVELOPMENT PERIOD IS CALLED NEAT
YOU1000000166_S0000112	AND AFTER HUMANS BENEFITED FROM IT SURVIVING WHEN OUR RELATIVES DIDN'T WELL EVOLUTION DIDN'T STOP ITS ROLE
YOU1000000166_S0000113	HUMANS ARE ACTUALLY STILL EXPERIENCING LONGER DEVELOPMENT PERIODS NOW THAN WE EVEN DID TEN THOUSAND YEARS AGO
YOU1000000166_S0000114	THE SHAPE OF OUR FACES AND HEADS ARE CONTINUALLY BECOMING LESS LIKE OUR NEANDERTHAL COUSINS BY BECOMING FLATTER LESS HAIRY LESS OBLONG
YOU1000000166_S0000115	AGAIN WE SHARE A LOT OF THESE SAME FEATURES WITH OTA WHO'S SMALL FLAT FACED WITH AN ENORMOUS HEAD BUT IF HUMAN EVOLUTION CONTINUES TO MAKE OUR CHILDHOODS LONGER AND LONGER
YOU1000000166_S0000116	QUESTION OF COURSE BECOMES WHERE DOES IT STOP WELL IT STOPS AT YODA
YOU1000000166_S0000117	THE PROBLEM WITH A LONG CHILDHOOD IS THAT A LOT CAN HAPPEN WHEN YOU'RE TINY AND HELPLESS
YOU1000000166_S0000118	EVENTUALLY THERE'S AN EVOLUTIONARY TIPPING POINT WHERE CHILDHOOD BECOMES SO LONG THAT IT ACTUALLY LEAVES THE SPECIES TOO VULNERABLE TO SURVIVE INTO ADULTHOOD
YOU1000000166_S0000119	TRACTORS COULD VERY WELL BE THE EXTREME END POINT OF A SPECIES LIKE OURS
YOU1000000166_S0000120	THE MANDALORIAN CLEARLY SHOWS BABY REDACTES EVEN FIFTY YEAR OLD BABY TRIALS AREN'T CAPABLE OF TAKING CARE OF THEMSELVES
YOU1000000166_S0000121	SURE THEY HAVE IMPRESSIVE FORCE POWERS BUT VERY LITTLE CONTROL OVER THEM
YOU1000000166_S0000123	HUMAN CHILDREN SIMILARLY ARE PRETTY DARN HELPLESS AND IT MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO DO THINGS LIKE BABYPROOF THE HOUSE AND MAKE UP ALL KINDS OF SAFETY RULES FOR KIDS
YOU1000000166_S0000124	IMAGINE HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT THAT SORT OF STUFF FOR FIFTY OR EVEN A HUNDRED YEARS IT BECOMES EXTREMELY HARD FOR THE SPECIES TO GET THEIR OFFSPRING TO A PLACE OF SELF SUFFICIENCY
YOU1000000166_S0000125	AND THAT'S JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG NATURAL DISASTERS PLAGUES DRONE ATTACKS FROM THE EMPIRE
YOU1000000166_S0000126	ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE GONNA BE PRETTY DARN HARD TO AVOID BUT THEY BECOME A LOT EASIER TO BOUNCE BACK FROM IF SUDDENLY YOUR SPECIES CAN REPOPULATE QUICKLY
YOU1000000166_S0000127	BUT IF ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'RE SPENDING A HUNDRED YEARS OR MORE TO REPRODUCE A SINGLE GENERATION
YOU1000000166_S0000128	I MEAN YOU'RE JUST BEGGING FOR THE NEXT DEATH STAR TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE ZAP WHICH BRINGS US TO YOU
YOU1000000166_S0000129	WE KNOW SO LITTLE ABOUT HIS HISTORY BUT WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO THEORIZE IS PRETTY DARN INCREDIBLE HE'S PRACTICALLY THE LAST OF HIS SPECIES
YOU1000000166_S0000130	BECAUSE OF THE EVOLUTIONARY DOUBLE EDGED SWORD THAT HE'S DEALING WITH ON ONE HAND HE'S ONE OF THE MOST HIGHLY EVOLVED BEINGS IN THE GALAXY
YOU1000000166_S0000131	BUT HE'S SO EVOLVED THAT HIS SPECIES CAN NO LONGER SURVIVE THEY'RE COMPLETELY OBSCURE
YOU1000000166_S0000132	IT'S INCREDIBLY TRAGIC AND NO WE DON'T HAVE ANY OF THE DETAILS ABOUT HOW THE TRACTS WERE WIPED OUT BUT THAT ELONGATED CHILDHOOD
YOU1000000166_S0000133	EXTENDED NEOTENY TO THE EXTREMES OF FIFTY PLUS YEARS OF CHILDHOOD THAT IS CERTAINLY A MASSIVE CONTRIBUTOR
YOU1000000166_S0000134	AS TO WHY SO INCREDIBLY STAR WARS THE SERIES OFTEN DERIDED AS BEING SPACE FANTASY
YOU1000000166_S0000135	NOT SCIENCE FICTION TURNS OUT TO BE SCIENTIFICALLY PLAUSIBLE YET AGAIN SO I GOTTA HAND IT TO YOU LUCAS I'M PRETTY STUNNED
YOU1000000166_S0000136	I'VE TRIED TO HELP YOU OUT WITH THIS AND THE WHOLE MIDI CHLORIANS POWERING THE FORCE THING BUT I GOTTA ADMIT STILL HAVE SOME QUIBBLES TO LEVEL AT YOU ABOUT THE JETS RECRUITMENT PRACTICES
YOU1000000166_S0000137	IT'LL BE COMING UP PRETTY SOON WE HAVE SOME BONES TO PICK ON THAT FRONT OKAY FRIEND IN THE MEANTIME IF YOU DIDN'T SEE THE REAL LIFE EQUIVALENT OF MACLAREN
YOU1000000166_S0000138	HOW THEY'RE ACTUALLY POWERING THE REAL LIFE FORCE IN YOUR DAY TO DAY LIFE CLICK THE VIDEO THAT YOU SEE ON SCREEN RIGHT NOW
YOU1000000166_S0000139	THAT'LL TAKE YOU TO MY OTHER SCIENCE OF STAR WARS EPISODE OVER ON GAME THEORY LOOKING AT MIDI CHLORIANS MITOCHONDRIA
YOU1000000166_S0000140	HOW WE'RE ALL JUST A LITTLE BIT IN THE MEANTIME REMEMBER THAT'S JUST A THEORY A FILM THEORY AND CUTS
YOU1000000167_S0000000	WINNIE THE POOH AND THE ROYAL BIRTHDAY INSPIRED BY A MILL AND SHEPHARD WITH DECORATIONS BY MARK BURGES
YOU1000000167_S0000002	READ BY JIM BROADBAND
YOU1000000167_S0000004	YOU COULD TELL CHRISTOPHER ROBIN HAD SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO SAY FROM THE WAY HE CLASPED HIS KNEES TIGHTLY AND WRIGGLED HIS TOES
YOU1000000167_S0000006	EVERYBODY GATHERED ROUND AND LOOKED AT HIM EXPECTANTLY
YOU1000000167_S0000008	I'VE HEARD THAT HER MAJESTY CHRISTOPHER ROBIN BEGAN SQUEAKED PIGLET IN A STATE OF GREAT EXCITEMENT
YOU1000000167_S0000009	HER ROYAL HIGHNESS HE WENT ON QUITE SO QUITE SO AGREED RABBIT THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND HE SAID QUICKLY BEFORE ANYONE ELSE COULD INTERRUPT HIM
YOU1000000167_S0000010	THE QUEEN SAID TO BE MUCH RELIEVED THE OTHER PEOPLE YOU MENTIONED SOUNDED MUCH TOO TALL AND FEARSOME BUT THE QUEEN IS QUITE DIFFERENT
YOU1000000167_S0000011	HAD ONCE SENT A LETTER AND WAS TOLD TO STICK ON A SMALL PICTURE OF THE QUEEN IT STUCK MORE TO HIS NOSE THAN TO THE LETTER
YOU1000000167_S0000012	BUT IT TOLD THE POSTMAN THAT IT WAS MOST URGENT AND THAT THE QUEEN SAYS IT MUST BE SENT AND SO HE WAS SURE IT HAD BEEN
YOU1000000167_S0000014	AS I WAS SAYING SAID CHRISTOPHER ROBIN PASSING A HONEY SANDWICH SO THAT HE MIGHT CONTINUE SPEAKING
YOU1000000167_S0000015	HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IS CELEBRATING AN IMPORTANT BIRTHDAY HER NINETIETH BIRTHDAY AND WE SHOULD TOO CELEBRATE
YOU1000000167_S0000016	THAT IS BY GIVING HER A PRESENT
YOU1000000167_S0000018	I HAD A PRESENT ONCE SIGHED WISTFULLY
YOU1000000167_S0000020	IN FACT IF I MAY BOAST A LITTLE
YOU1000000167_S0000022	ONE WAS RATHER SMALL AND DAMP AND THE OTHER SOMEWHAT LARGER AND STICKY
YOU1000000167_S0000024	I DON'T LIKE TO COMPLAIN
YOU1000000167_S0000026	PRESENT IS SOMETHING AND TO HAVE TWO IS SOMETHING ELSE
YOU1000000167_S0000028	BOTH POO AND PIGLET BLUSHED SLIGHTLY THEY HAD A MEMORY OF A WONDERFUL BALLOON AND A LARGE JAR OF THE BEST HONEY
YOU1000000167_S0000029	THAT HAD BEGUN AS EXCEEDINGLY GOOD PRESENTS AND THEN
YOU1000000167_S0000030	DUE TO VARIOUS MISHAPS HAD BECOME RATHER DISAPPOINTING PRESENT
YOU1000000167_S0000031	BUT WHICH WERE PRESENT NEVERTHELESS AND AS I HAD SAID THAT WAS SOMETHING
YOU1000000167_S0000033	THE QUESTION IS SAID RABBIT IMPORTANTLY WHAT DO QUEENS LIKE BEST
YOU1000000167_S0000035	HONEY I SHOULD THINK SIGHED POO LOOKING AT THE SMALL STICKY CRUMB WHERE THE HONEY SANDWICHES HAD ONCE BEEN
YOU1000000167_S0000037	I'VE HEARD SAID CHRISTOPHER ROBIN WHO KNEW A GREAT DEAL ABOUT FARAWAY PLACES LIKE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FOREST AND LONDON
YOU1000000167_S0000038	THAT THE QUEEN HAS A GRAND TEA EVERY DAY IN HER PALACE WITH BUTTERED TOAST AND CRUMPETS
YOU1000000167_S0000039	SO I SHOULDN'T THINK WE'D NEED TO GIVE HER ANYTHING TO EAT HER PRESENT SHOULD BE SOMETHING TO TREASURE
YOU1000000167_S0000041	I'VE NEVER HAD MUCH LUCK FINDING TREASURE SIGHED POO
YOU1000000167_S0000043	I DID ONCE FIND THE NORTH POLE DO YOU SUPPOSE THE QUEEN MIGHT LIKE THAT
YOU1000000167_S0000045	THE FRIENDS THOUGHT THIS AN EXCELLENT IDEA BUT IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE THEY REALIZED THAT FINDING THE NORTH POLE ONCE WAS A VERY FINE THING
YOU1000000167_S0000046	BUT THAT FINDING IT AGAIN WAS AN ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT THING
YOU1000000167_S0000048	SUDDENLY THE FOREST SEEMED TO BE FULL OF STICKS THAT COULD OR COULD NOT BE THE NORTH POLE
YOU1000000167_S0000050	THIS WILL NEVER DO ANNOUNCED RABBIT
YOU1000000167_S0000052	MUMBLED THAT BRINGS TO MIND A LITTLE HUM WHICH I'D LIKE TO
YOU1000000167_S0000053	IF IT WAS FELT THAT A HUM WAS CALLED FOR AT SUCH A TIME OF THOUGHTFULNESS AND WITHOUT WAITING FOR A REPLY HE BEGAN
YOU1000000167_S0000055	QUEEN LIVED IN HER PALACE AS QUEENS OFTEN DO
YOU1000000167_S0000057	DOING ALL THOSE BUSY THINGS BUSY QUEENS DO
YOU1000000167_S0000059	BUT THE QUEEN COULD NEVER KNOW AS YOU AND I DO
YOU1000000167_S0000061	DOING NOTHING MUCH CAN BE THE BEST THING TO DO
YOU1000000167_S0000063	SO FROM A FOREST FAR AWAY FOR YOUR SPECIAL DAY
YOU1000000167_S0000065	SENDING YOU SOME QUIET AND A LITTLE TIME TO PLAY
YOU1000000167_S0000067	AND QUIET THERE WAS
YOU1000000167_S0000069	THE SORT OF QUIET THAT MAKES THE TIP OF YOUR NOSE TURN A SUNSET SHADE OF PINK
YOU1000000167_S0000071	
YOU1000000167_S0000073	ANNOUNCED CHRISTOPHER ROBIN SOLEMNLY
YOU1000000167_S0000075	THAT HUM IS FIT FOR A QUEEN THAT HUM SHALL BE THE QUEEN'S PRESENT OWL SHALL WRITE IT OUT AND YOU AND I
YOU1000000167_S0000076	AND I WILL DELIVER IT TO BUCKINGHAM PALACE AND PIGLET MUST COME TOO BECAUSE LONDON IS A VERY BIG PLACE INDEED
YOU1000000167_S0000077	AND EVEN SMALL ANIMALS IF THEY ARE VERY GOOD FRIENDS CAN MAKE EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT
YOU1000000167_S0000079	AND SO IT WAS DECIDED AND OWL WAS CALLED FOR OWL FUSSED HERE AND FUSSED THERE
YOU1000000167_S0000081	AND USED UP A GOOD DEAL OF TIME PAPER AND INK BUT AT LAST IT WAS DONE AND EVERYONE ADMIRED IT
YOU1000000167_S0000082	CHANGE WHO KNEW HOW IMPORTANT PRESENTATION WAS ESPECIALLY FOR QUEENS TOOK THE HUM ROLLED IT
YOU1000000167_S0000083	AND TIED A THICK VINE ROUND IT INTO THE VINE SHE TWISTED WILD HEATHER COLUMBINE BUTTERCUPS MEADOWSWEET TIME
YOU1000000167_S0000084	AND LASTLY A THISTLE KINDLY DONATED BY
YOU1000000167_S0000086	CHRISTOPHER ROBIN ALSO FOUND A BEAUTIFUL BRIGHT RED BALLOON WHICH HE THOUGHT THE QUEEN MIGHT ENJOY ON GRAY DAYS
YOU1000000167_S0000087	LET YOU SHOULD HOLD IT HE SAID THAT WAY WE WON'T LOSE YOU IN THE CROWD
YOU1000000167_S0000089	PIGLET HELD ON VERY TIGHTLY TO THE BALLOON HE WASN'T QUITE SURE WHAT A CROWD WAS SOMETHING LIKE A DARK CLOUD PERHAPS
YOU1000000167_S0000090	BUT IN ANY CASE HE DIDN'T WANT TO GET LOST IN IT AND WAS PLEASED THE BALLOON WOULD HELP
YOU1000000167_S0000092	SO THE PRESENTS WERE READY AND SIDE BY SIDE WINNIE THE POOH EDWARD BEAR BEAR OF VERY LITTLE BRAIN BRAVE ADVENTURER
YOU1000000167_S0000093	AND LOYAL FRIEND HIS SMALL COMPANION PIGLET AND CHRISTOPHER ROBIN SET OFF FOR LONDON
YOU1000000167_S0000095	OF COURSE LONDON IS ON QUITE THE OTHER SIDE REMARKED CHRISTOPHER ROBBIN AS THEY WERE WALKING
YOU1000000167_S0000097	THE SEA ASKED SOMEWHAT ALARMED
YOU1000000167_S0000099	NOT THE SEA I SHOULDN'T THINK REPLIED CHRISTOPHER ROBIN WHOSE GEOGRAPHY LESSONS SO FAR HAD BEEN MOSTLY SPENT COLORING IN EDGY BITS
YOU1000000167_S0000100	BUT CERTAINLY THE COUNTRY OR COUNTY I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHICH IN ANY CASE IT IS VERY FAR OFF AND WE SHALL HAVE TO CATCH A TRAIN
YOU1000000167_S0000102	I DO HOPE IT WANTS TO BE CAUGHT SAID WHO WAS ALREADY A LITTLE OUT OF PUFF FROM THE WALK BUT THE TRAIN WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO STOP FOR THEM IN THE STATION
YOU1000000167_S0000103	SO THERE WAS NO CATCHING TO BE DONE AT ALL AND THERE WAS PLENTY OF TIME TO CLIMB ABOARD AND FIND FOUR COMFY SEATS
YOU1000000167_S0000104	AND THEN THEY WERE OFF
YOU1000000167_S0000106	WOULD YOU BE SO KIND AS TO STAY VERY CLOSE BY ASKED AN ANXIOUS PIGLET AS THEY GOT OFF THE TRAIN AT VICTORIA STATION
YOU1000000167_S0000107	HE HADN'T EXPECTED LONDON TO HAVE QUITE SO MANY LEGS
YOU1000000167_S0000109	WERE PINSTRIPED LEGS BIG BOOTED LEGS AND SOME LEGS BALANCED ON POINTY SHOES WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE A LITTLE STICK STUCK TO THE BOTTOM OF EACH SOUL
YOU1000000167_S0000111	THEY WERE ALL IN A TERRIBLE RUSH AND SEEMED TO KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THEY WERE GOING
YOU1000000167_S0000113	CHRISTOPHER ROBIN POO PIGLET AND LAUNCHED THEMSELVES INTO THIS VAST FOREST OF LEGS AND HOPED THEY'D COME OUT ALL RIGHT
YOU1000000167_S0000115	THEY EMERGED INTO A BUSY STREET
YOU1000000167_S0000117	CHRISTOPHER ROBIN TOLD THEM THAT THE LARGE BLACK VEHICLES RUSHING PAST WERE CALLED TRAFFIC
YOU1000000167_S0000119	WHO THOUGHT THAT TRAFFIC LOOKED LIKE GIANT SHINY BEETLES AND THINKING OF THEM AS BEETLES MADE IT LESS WORRYING
YOU1000000167_S0000121	THE FRIENDS WALKED AND THEY WALKED
YOU1000000167_S0000122	BUT IS SIGHS THAT HAD STARTED OUT AS SMALL PUFFS WERE NOW GROWING SO LARGE AND LOUD
YOU1000000167_S0000123	THAT THEY WERE WORRIED HE WOULD RUN OUT OF PUFF ALTOGETHER AND WINNIE THE POOH LEGS WERE KNOWN FOR THEIR STOUTNESS NOT THEIR BRISK WALKING
YOU1000000167_S0000124	AND PIGLETS LEGS WERE SO SHORT THAT THEY WERE HARDLY WORTH SPEAKING OF AT ALL
YOU1000000167_S0000126	SO CHRISTOPHER ROBBINS SUGGESTED THEY RIDE ON A BUS THE REST OF THE WAY TO BUCKINGHAM PALACE
YOU1000000167_S0000128	MOST CONSIDERATE I'M SURE SIGHED
YOU1000000167_S0000130	ALTHOUGH SLIGHTLY LESS PUFFY THIS TIME
YOU1000000167_S0000132	THE FRIENDS HAD NEVER BEEN ON A BUS BEFORE AND THIS WAS A MOST UNUSUAL ONE IT HAD WINDING STAIRS
YOU1000000167_S0000133	AND UP AT THE TOP THERE WAS NO ROOF AT ALL
YOU1000000167_S0000135	AS THE BUS BEGAN TO MOVE THE WIND DID ITS BEST TO BLOW PIGLETS EARS RIGHT OFF AND HE NEARLY LOST HOLD OF THE BALLOON
YOU1000000167_S0000136	WE'LL CALL THIS THE BLUSTERY BUS LAUGHED CHRISTOPHER ROBIN
YOU1000000167_S0000138	THE BUS TOOK THE FRIENDS PAST A GREAT MANY IMPORTANT BUILDINGS
YOU1000000167_S0000140	CHRISTOPHER ROBIN DIDN'T KNOW ALL THE NAMES

YOU1000000168_S0000002	WITH YOUR NEWEST ANIMAL COMPANION WELL YOU COULD BRAVE THE MISSION AND OPT FOR A BANGLE TIGER LIKE MIKE TYSON BUT A FULL GROWN WILDCAT IS QUITE A PIECE OF WORK
YOU1000000168_S0000003	AND NOT EXACTLY WHAT WE HAD IN MIND FOR TODAY'S LIST WE WERE THINKING A LITTLE MORE CUTE AND EXOTIC LIKE THE PLAYFUL CHINCHILLA
YOU1000000168_S0000004	OR THE FLUFFY PENICK FOX PERHAPS EVEN A GOOFY CRESTED GECKO OR A DOG SIZED RODENT LIKE THE AUSTRALIAN CAPYBARA
YOU1000000168_S0000005	WITH A LITTLE EXTRA RESEARCH AND WORK THESE BIZARRE AND ADORABLE ANIMALS COULD REALISTICALLY BECOME YOUR NEXT PET SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO TURN A FEW HEADS

YOU1000000168_S0000010	THE SOUTH AMERICAN CAPYBARA IS ONE OF THE LARGEST RODENTS IN THE WORLD AND CAN WEIGH UP TO ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY POUNDS NOT TO WORRY
YOU1000000168_S0000011	YOU WON'T BE NEEDING A HUGE CAGE BECAUSE CAPYBARAS ARE SEMI AQUATIC RODANTS SO SCRATCH THE DOG SIZED HAMSTER WHEEL OFF YOUR LIST
YOU1000000168_S0000012	BECAUSE THIS ANIMAL DEFINITELY NEEDS ACCESS TO A BODY OF WATER IN ORDER TO SWIM AROUND LIKE YOUR POOL
YOU1000000168_S0000014	ALTHOUGH MOSTLY ADORABLE AND SWEET CAPYBARAS CAN BE A CHALLENGING PET ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THEY'RE EXTREMELY SOCIAL ANIMALS
YOU1000000168_S0000015	SO IF YOU'RE PLANNING ON OWNING ONE IT'S BEST TO MAKE ROOM FOR A COUPLE MORE THIS RODENT IS LEGAL TO OWN IN MOST PARTS OF THE WORLD
YOU1000000168_S0000016	ALTHOUGH SOME COUNTRIES AND STATES MAY REQUIRE A SEPARATE LICENSE BUT THOSE CUTE AND FURRY SNOUTS ARE WELL WORTH THE EXTRA PAPERWORK
YOU1000000168_S0000017	NINE THE SERVILE NOW WE CAN'T ALL ADOPT A ROYAL BENGAL TIGER AS MIKE TYSON ONCE DID
YOU1000000168_S0000018	BUT MOST CAT LOVERS WOULD SURELY LOVE TO SETTLE FOR THIS WILD BEAUTY SERVIS CAN EVEN BE LITTER TRAINED IF YOU START EARLY ENOUGH
YOU1000000168_S0000020	THESE MEDIUM SIZED AFRICAN CATS ARE ACCUSTOMED TO WARM CLIMATES IN WIDE OPEN SPACES
YOU1000000168_S0000021	FOR YOU PET OWNERS IT MEANS YOU'LL NEED A MODERATE AMOUNT OF SPACE FOR YOUR EXOTIC CAT TO FEEL AT HOME
YOU1000000168_S0000023	CIRCLES REQUIRE LOTS OF DAILY EXERCISE AND LOVE TO PLAY SO A SPACIOUS GARDEN IS PROBABLY YOUR BEST BET
YOU1000000168_S0000025	EIGHT THE PENICK FOX AS IF FOXES WEREN'T CUTE ENOUGH WE GIVE YOU THE PENICK FOX

YOU1000000168_S0000029	ONLY REACHING ABOUT FOUR POUNDS WHEN FULLY GROWN BUT THE SAME CANNOT BE SAID ABOUT THE SIZE OF THOSE ADORABLE EARS
YOU1000000168_S0000030	IF YOU NEVER QUITE FIGURED OUT WHETHER YOU'RE A CAT OR A DOG PERSON THE PHOENIX FOX MAY BECOME YOUR FAVORITE FOUR LEGGED COMPANION
YOU1000000168_S0000031	WHAT ARE YOU DOING
YOU1000000168_S0000033	
YOU1000000168_S0000035	THIS FOX'S BEHAVIOR CAN BEST BE DESCRIBED AS A CROSSWAY BETWEEN THAT OF A DOG AND A CAT
YOU1000000168_S0000037	THEY'RE USUALLY PLAYFUL AND ENERGETIC LIKE A DOG BUT JUST AS EQUALLY INDEPENDENT LIKE A CAT SO YOU'LL BE FINE LEAVING THEM HOME ALONE FOR A FEW HOURS
YOU1000000168_S0000039	WHAT SETS THEM APART THOUGH IS THAT THEY DON'T REALLY FAVOUR DOG OR CAT TOYS THIS EXOTIC ANIMAL CAN LIVE UP TO FIFTEEN YEARS
YOU1000000168_S0000040	IT IS LEGAL TO OWN IN MOST OF AMERICA WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW STATES BUT HEY IF YOU'RE DYING TO OWN ONE YOU CAN ALWAYS JUST MOVE TO ANOTHER STATE
YOU1000000168_S0000042	OH MY GOD
YOU1000000168_S0000044	SEVEN BOX TURTLES

YOU1000000168_S0000048	THEY CARRY THEIR HOMES ON THEIR BACKS AND THIS SPECIES CAN LIVE FOR UP TO FIFTY YEARS
YOU1000000168_S0000050	WHICH MAY SEEM LIKE A LOT FOR A HOUSEHOLD PET BUT IS LAUGHABLE WHEN COMPARED TO JONATHAN THE WORLD'S OLDEST TURTLE AT ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE YEARS OLD
YOU1000000168_S0000052	BOX TURTLES LIKE TO SOAK IN WATER FROM TIME TO TIME TO REHYDRATE AND COOL DOWN
YOU1000000168_S0000054	BUT THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MAKE THEM PRO SWIMMERS IN FACT THEY'RE ACTUALLY LAND TURTLES
YOU1000000168_S0000056	LOOK PRETTY CLUMSY WHILE DOING IT SO DESPITE THEIR SHARP BEAKS ROUGH SCALY SKIN AND TINY POINTED CLAWS
YOU1000000168_S0000057	A BOX TURTLE CAN MAKE A PRETTY DARN CUTE ADDITION TO YOUR TERRARIUM
YOU1000000168_S0000059	SIX THE CHINCHILLA FROM HAMSTERS TO GERBILS RODENTS HAVE A REPUTATION AS ONE OF THE CUTEST HOUSEHOLD PETS
YOU1000000168_S0000060	BUT ON THE MORE EXOTIC END OF THE SPECTRUM AND PERHAPS TEN TIMES MORE ADORABLE IS THE CHINCHILLA
YOU1000000168_S0000062	SOUTH AMERICAN CHINCHILLA CAN BOND VERY CLOSELY WITH ITS CARETAKER
YOU1000000168_S0000064	BUT UNFORTUNATELY IS ONE OF THE MORE DESTRUCTIVE RODENTS
YOU1000000168_S0000066	THAT'S NOT TO SAY THEY'RE DANGEROUS OR ANYTHING THEY JUST DON'T LIKE TO BE CUDDLED
YOU1000000168_S0000067	NO NO NO NO NO NO HIT ME HARD

YOU1000000168_S0000072	BUT WE'RE SURE YOU'LL AGREE THOSE GIGANTIC EARS AND THAT FLUFFY TAIL ARE WELL WORTH THE EXTRA EFFORT

YOU1000000168_S0000082	ALTHOUGH THE TWO LOOK SIMILAR SUGAR GLIDERS ARE ACTUALLY PART OF THE MARSUPIAL FAMILY JUST LIKE KANGAROOS
YOU1000000168_S0000084	THE FEMALES GLIDER DOUBLES AS A POUCH WHERE THEY RAISE THEIR YOUNG UNTIL THEY'RE OLD ENOUGH TO FLY OFF
YOU1000000168_S0000086	I MEAN GLIDE OFF ON THEIR OWN
YOU1000000168_S0000088	IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHERE THEY GOT THE NAME IT'S BECAUSE THEY LOVE TO EAT ALMOST ANYTHING THAT IS SWEET ESPECIALLY FRESH FRUIT AND VEGETABLES

YOU1000000169_S0000061	THERE'S ME COME
YOU1000000169_S0000062	AFTER ONLY ONE TRIAL THE NEW TOY AND THE SOUND MEOW ARE LODGED IN HER BRAIN
YOU1000000169_S0000063	WATCH ME CATCH A GOOD GIRL
YOU1000000169_S0000065	AND IT JUST GOES TO SHOW THAT YOU CAN TEACH AN OLD DOG NEW TRICKS TO SEE AFRICAN WILD DOGS IN THE FLESH IS A REAL PRIVILEGE
YOU1000000169_S0000066	IT'S THOUGHT THERE MAY ONLY BE THREE THOUSAND LEFT IN THE WILD MAKING THEM ONE OF THE MOST ENDANGERED MAMMALS IN AFRICA
YOU1000000169_S0000068	ALADDIN THE ALPHA MALE WEARS THE RADIO COLLAR
YOU1000000169_S0000070	IT REALLY IS QUITE FASCINATING TO WATCH THE ALPHA PER ALWAYS TOGETHER ALWAYS TOGETHER
YOU1000000169_S0000071	MALE IS CONSTANTLY TRAILING BEHIND HER WHEREVER SHE GOES
YOU1000000169_S0000073	ALADDIN AND FEATHER HAVE ONLY BEEN TOGETHER FOR FOUR MONTHS BUT THEY'RE ALREADY OFF TO A FLYING START FEATHER IS VISIBLY PREGNANT
YOU1000000169_S0000076	BUT EVEN THOUGH HE'S NOW DONE THE JOB SHE IS PREGNANT WITH HIS PUPS HE DOESN'T LEAVE HER SIDE FOR ONE MINUTE
YOU1000000169_S0000078	IT'S UNUSUAL FOR AN ALPHA MALE TO BE SO ATTENTIVE AT THIS STAGE ALADDIN SEEMS TO BE A PARTICULARLY DEVOTED PARTNER
YOU1000000169_S0000080	TARAN HAS BEEN MONITORING FEATHER AND ALADDIN'S PROGRESS FROM THE START SO TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW ALADDIN AND FEATHER BEHAVE WITH EACH OTHER AS THE ALPHA PAIR
YOU1000000169_S0000081	WE'VE OFTEN SEEN HIM WITH HIS CHIN RESTING ON HER REAR END AND JUST FOLLOWING HER AROUND AND HE'S BEEN OBSERVED SLEEPING WITH HIS PAW ON HER AT NIGHT
YOU1000000169_S0000082	IT'S TYPICAL IT'S WHAT WE CALL MATE GUARDING BEHAVIOR HE'S LOOKING AFTER HER HE'S MAKING SURE THAT SHE'S THAT SHE'S FED AND HEALTHY
YOU1000000169_S0000083	ONCE SHE'S PREGNANT HE CONTINUES TO FOLLOW HER EVEN THOUGH HE'S ALREADY DONE HIS JOB AND FATHERED HER LITTER
YOU1000000169_S0000084	AND I THINK THAT'S HIS WAY OF ENSURING THAT HIS LITTER OF PUPS SURVIVE AND IS HEALTHY
YOU1000000169_S0000086	ALADDIN AND FEATHER LOOK LIKE A SOLID COUPLE
YOU1000000169_S0000088	AND THAT'S GOOD NEWS FOR EVERYONE ELSE IN THE GROUP
YOU1000000169_S0000090	BECAUSE AS THE ALPHA PAIR IT'S THEIR JOB TO PROVIDE THE PACK WITH NEW PUPS
YOU1000000169_S0000092	SO IS THAT IT ARE THEY COMPLETELY ESTABLISHED AND THEIR ROLES ARE DETERMINED AND EVERYTHING WAS HUNKY DORY WITH THE WHOLE
YOU1000000169_S0000093	SO FAR SO GOOD THE THE KEY WILL BE HOW SUCCESSFUL THEY ARE AT RAISING THAT LITTER OF PUPS AS A PACK
YOU1000000169_S0000094	THE SUCCESS OF A PACK ALWAYS DEPENDS ON ON THEIR ON THEIR REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS SO HOW WELL THEY WORK TOGETHER TO SUCCESSFULLY REAR THEIR YOUNG
YOU1000000169_S0000095	THEY'RE NOT HOME FREE
YOU1000000169_S0000096	NOT AT ALL NOT AT ALL
YOU1000000169_S0000097	WHENEVER YOU GET A NEW PAPER IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING UNTIL THEY'VE SUCCESSFULLY REARED THEIR FIRST THEIR FIRST LETTER OH GOSH NO PRESSURE
YOU1000000169_S0000099	FORTUNATELY FOR ALADIN AND FEATHER THE REST OF THE GROUP WILL BE THERE TO LEND A HELPING HAND
YOU1000000169_S0000100	THE OTHER ADULT FEMALES ARE FEATHER SISTERS AND THE MALES COME FROM DIFFERENT PACKS
YOU1000000169_S0000102	ON THE RACE BEHIND US
YOU1000000169_S0000103	IT'S ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY WHERE EVERYONE PITCHES IN
YOU1000000169_S0000105	THERE ARE A FEW PLACES ON SVALBARD WHERE PEOPLE LIVE YEAR ROUND ONE OF THEM IS THE POLISH RESEARCH STATION AT HORIZON
YOU1000000169_S0000107	THEY'VE HAD BEARS VISIT THEM THIS YEAR BUT NO FATAL RUN INS THANKS TO A TRIED AND TESTED POLAR BEAR WARNING SYSTEM
YOU1000000169_S0000109	LOLA THAT'S MY DAUGHTER'S NAME
YOU1000000169_S0000110	LILIANA KLINKE NAROD HAS WORKED AT THE BASE FOR ALMOST A YEAR
YOU1000000169_S0000111	SHE'S THE BRAVEST ONE
YOU1000000169_S0000112	IF A POLAR BEAR WALKS WALKS IN THE DOGS START BARKING AND DO THEY SCARE OFF MOST TIMES REALLY
YOU1000000169_S0000114	DOGS LIKE LOLA BARK AS SOON AS THEY GET A WHIFF OF A BEAR
YOU1000000169_S0000116	THIS GIVES THE RESEARCHERS TIME TO COME OUT WITH A FLARE GUN AND SCARE IT OFF
YOU1000000169_S0000118	FOR LOLA HERE HOW CLOSE HAS SHE BEEN TO A POLAR BEAR
YOU1000000169_S0000119	WELL SHE WAS ATTACKED THREE YEARS
YOU1000000169_S0000120	
YOU1000000169_S0000121	YES SHE HAD SOME STITCHES ON HER HERE OVER HERE ON THE LEG
YOU1000000169_S0000123	AFTER SHE WAS ATTACKED BY THE POLAR BEAR DID HER ATTITUDE CHANGE TOWARDS WAS SHE MORE SCARED
YOU1000000169_S0000124	NO SHE JUST GOT MORE BRAVE AND
YOU1000000169_S0000125	OUR JOB YES FROM THE POLAR BEARS THAT YOU'VE SEEN COME THROUGH HERE HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT SOME ARE MORE CURIOUS THAT THEY DO HAVE DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES
YOU1000000169_S0000127	YES YEAH SOME SOME ARE SCARED ONCE AND THEY THEY GO AWAY BUT SOME ARE REALLY
YOU1000000169_S0000129	STARVING SO SO HUNGRY
YOU1000000169_S0000131	THINK IT'S GREAT THE WAY THAT THE DOG SENSES ARE USED TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE FROM POLAR BEARS THEY'VE GOT EXCELLENT HEARING FANTASTIC SENSE OF SMELL
YOU1000000169_S0000132	AND THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO TECHNOLOGY IN THE WORLD THAT CAN DETECT POLAR BEARS AS GOOD AS A DOG CAN
YOU1000000169_S0000134	IT'S A SMALL SIGN OF HOPE THERE ARE WAYS TO KEEP BOTH PEOPLE AND POLAR BEARS SAFE
YOU1000000169_S0000136	MAX IS A RED COLE CROSS NORMALLY FULL OF ENERGY AND ENTHUSIASM
YOU1000000169_S0000137	BUT IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT HIS OWNER MORINE BURNS NOTICED THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG
YOU1000000169_S0000139	I THOUGHT AT THE TIME MAX WAS FADING HE WAS NINE AND A HALF
YOU1000000169_S0000141	AND I WAS PREPARING MYSELF FOR LOSING HIM BECAUSE HE JUST WASN'T HAPPY WOULDN'T COME WITH ME WOULDN'T SIT BY ME WOULDN'T SIT ON MY LAP
YOU1000000169_S0000143	AND THE ODD SIGNS HE WOULD COME UP
YOU1000000169_S0000145	AND TOUCH MY BREAST WITH HIS NOSE
YOU1000000169_S0000147	BACK OFF SO DESPERATELY UNHAPPY WITH SUCH A SAD LOOK IN HIS EYES
YOU1000000169_S0000149	MARINE HAD A SMALL LUMP IN HER BREAST BUT HER LATEST MAMMOGRAM WAS CLEAR SO SHE PRESUMED ALL WAS OKAY
YOU1000000169_S0000151	INITIALLY I THOUGHT IT'S JUST ANOTHER LUMPY BREAST AS PEOPLE GET
YOU1000000169_S0000153	BUT THEN
YOU1000000169_S0000155	I SORT OF CONNECTED IT WITH THE DOG WITH HIS ODD BEHAVIOR AND ONE DAY I WAS LOOKING IN THE MIRROR IN THE BEDROOM HERE
YOU1000000169_S0000157	AND I LOOKED ACROSS IN THE MIRROR AT MAX'S EYES HE WAS ON THE BED AS HE IS NOW AND I KNEW IT WAS CANCER
YOU1000000169_S0000159	MARINE WENT TO HER LOCAL HOSPITAL BUT BOTH A SCAN AND A MAMMOGRAM CAME BACK NEGATIVE
YOU1000000169_S0000161	IT TOOK A SURGICAL BIOPSY TO FINALLY DETECT THE CANCER
YOU1000000169_S0000163	MORINE HAD IT REMOVED AND THE CHANGE IN MAX'S BEHAVIOUR WAS INSTANT
YOU1000000169_S0000165	THE DAY I WAS PICKED UP FROM THE HOSPITAL
YOU1000000169_S0000167	HE WAS HIS OLD HYPER SELF AGAIN
YOU1000000169_S0000169	PUT HIS NOSE ACROSS MY BREAST TO CHECK WHERE THE OPERATION HAD BEEN AND HE WAS WAGGING HIS TAIL AND HIS EYES WERE HAPPY AND
YOU1000000169_S0000170	IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE THE CHANGE IN HIM INSTANT
YOU1000000169_S0000172	I LOVE MAC SO MUCH AND I OWE HIM SO MUCH
YOU1000000169_S0000174	AND EVEN BEFORE I GO FOR A CHECKUP NOW I GET HIM TO CHECK ME OUT AND IF HE'S HAPPY AND WAGGING HIS TAIL I AM HAPPY
YOU1000000169_S0000175	AND I KNOW I'M OKAY
YOU1000000169_S0000177	WE NOW KNOW THAT DOGS LIKE MAX ARE SMELLING THE TINY VOLATILE CHEMICALS GIVEN OFF BY CANCEROUS TUMOURS
YOU1000000169_S0000179	MOST DOGS CAN DO THIS THEY JUST DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE INTERESTED
YOU1000000169_S0000181	BUT WITH A LITTLE TRAINING DOGS CAN ACCURATELY PICK OUT A CANCEROUS PATIENT FROM A SELECTION OF URINE SAMPLES
YOU1000000169_S0000182	GO GO GO
YOU1000000169_S0000184	THEY CAN EVEN BE TAUGHT TO LET DIABETICS LIKE STEPHEN KNOW THAT HIS BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS ARE SMELLING LOW LONG BEFORE HE CAN FEEL IT
YOU1000000169_S0000185	AND DEFINITELY BEFORE HE PASSES OUT
YOU1000000169_S0000187	DOGS LIKE STEPHENS ARE NOW TRANSFORMING LIVES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
YOU1000000169_S0000188	THEY'RE BEING TRAINED TO DETECT THE EARLY WARNING SIGNALS FOR SEVERE ALLERGIC REACTIONS EPILEPTIC FITS AND NARCOLEPSY
YOU1000000170_S0000001	I WORKED AT THIS PLACE
YOU1000000170_S0000002	AND FOR MY THEN CURRENT PROJECT WHICH WAS THE AMOEBA OPERATING SYSTEM WHICH I WAS WORKING UNDER SAME MELANDER
YOU1000000170_S0000003	ONE OF OUR PROJECTS WAS TO WRITE APPLICATION LEVEL UTILITIES
YOU1000000170_S0000004	FOR THIS NEW AMBA OPERATING SYSTEM
YOU1000000170_S0000005	AND SO THERE WAS AN OPERATING SYSTEM KERNEL AND IT WAS VERY GOOD AT TALKING TO THE NETWORK
YOU1000000170_S0000006	AND IT WAS VERY GOOD AT MANAGING PROCESSES BUT THERE WASN'T MUCH USER LEVEL SOFTWARE
YOU1000000170_S0000007	THERE WAS BARELY A SHELL I THINK THERE WAS A PORTED VERY OLD UNIX SHELL SOMETHING LIKE THE ORIGINAL VERSION UNIX VERSION SIX SHELL
YOU1000000170_S0000008	BUT BECAUSE THE FILE SYSTEM MODEL ON AMBA WAS SO VERY DIFFERENT
YOU1000000170_S0000009	WE COULDN'T TAKE AN EXISTING SUITE OF UNIX UTILITIES
YOU1000000170_S0000010	AND SO WE WANTED IT TO BE SELF HOSTING
YOU1000000170_S0000012	AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE REALIZED WE NEEDED A LARGE AMOUNT OF USER LEVEL SORT OF APPLICATIONS UTILITIES TOOLS
YOU1000000170_S0000013	WHATEVER YOU CALL IT FROM FROM AN EDITOR TO A MAIL PROGRAM TO LOGIN UTILITY AND A BACKUP TOOL
YOU1000000170_S0000014	AND ONE OF THE THINGS I REALIZED AS WE HAD A SMALL TEAM OF PEOPLE SORT OF WORKING ON THOSE THINGS
YOU1000000170_S0000015	THAT IT WAS VERY SLOW GOING WRITING ALL THAT STUFF IN AND IT WASN'T PARTICULARLY INTERESTING OR SORT OF NOVEL
YOU1000000170_S0000016	OR DIFFICULT AND OFTEN WE ALSO DIDN'T REALLY CARE HOW FAST THE CODE RAN
YOU1000000170_S0000017	ALL THE REASONS WHY YOU WOULD WRITE A PIECE OF SOFTWARE IN DIDN'T REALLY APPLY
YOU1000000170_S0000018	THE ONLY REASON LEFT WAS THAT WAS THE ONLY LANGUAGE LANGUAGE THAT FOR WHICH WE HAD A COMPILER
YOU1000000170_S0000019	THERE WAS THIS ABC LANGUAGE THAT I HAD IN THE BACK OF MY MIND THAT WOULD BE A MUCH BETTER LANGUAGE TO WRITE
YOU1000000170_S0000020	A WHOLE BUNCH OF UTILITY APPLICATION TOOLS FOR AMBA
YOU1000000170_S0000021	EXCEPT THAT ABC WAS SO HIGH AND ABSTRACT THAT IT REALLY
YOU1000000170_S0000023	IT IT WASN'T A GOOD LANGUAGE TO TALK TO SERVERS AND FILE SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES
YOU1000000170_S0000024	AND IT'S SORT OF THE WHOLE OPERATING SYSTEM THING WAS ABSTRACTED AWAY FROM ABC
YOU1000000170_S0000025	IT WAS ALMOST SOMETHING LIKE IT I DON'T KNOW IN IN AN ALTERNATE UNIVERSE ABC COULD HAVE BECOME THE LANGUAGE OF SPREADSHEETS
YOU1000000170_S0000026	IT WAS VERY GOOD TO FOR TALKING ABOUT A USER'S DATA
YOU1000000170_S0000027	AND DOING ALL SORTS OF CLEVER STUFF WITH THAT DATA
YOU1000000170_S0000028	AND IT DID THAT USING VERY SORT OF GENERAL ALL PURPOSE DATA STRUCTURES LIKE LISTS AND DICTIONARIES
YOU1000000170_S0000029	AND OF COURSE IT HAD VERY NICE CODE STRUCTURING DEVICES
YOU1000000170_S0000030	LIKE A SMALL NUMBER OF SIMPLE STATEMENTS THAT COULD BE COMBINED IN ANY WAY YOU WANTED TO CREATE OTHER CONSTRUCTS
YOU1000000170_S0000031	THE USUAL FUNCTION AND PROCEDURE ABSTRACTIONS
YOU1000000170_S0000032	IT WAS NOT AT ALL AN OBJECT ORIENTED LANGUAGE ALTHOUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION HAD SOME OBJECTS SORT OF SHINING THROUGH
YOU1000000170_S0000033	ANYWAY ABC
YOU1000000170_S0000035	AS IT EXISTED STILL WASN'T USABLE
YOU1000000170_S0000036	BUT SOMEHOW SINCE I HAD WORKED ON THE ABC PROJECT I KNEW EXACTLY HOW IT WAS BUILT
YOU1000000170_S0000037	AND I HAD THIS IDEA IN MY HEAD THAT
YOU1000000170_S0000039	GIVEN HOW MUCH TIME WE HAD AVAILABLE FOR OUR PROJECT I COULD ACTUALLY BUILD A WHOLE NEW LANGUAGE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT IT FROM SCRATCH
YOU1000000170_S0000040	GIVEN WHAT I LEARNED ABOUT BOTH THE DESIGN AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ABC AND START USING IT TO IMPLEMENT OUR SUITE OF TOOLS
YOU1000000170_S0000041	AND STILL BE AHEAD OF THE GAME COMPARED TO A SITUATION WHERE WE WOULD JUST HAVE SORT OF
YOU1000000170_S0000043	AND ON WRITING THE THINGS WE WANTED TO WRITE IN
YOU1000000170_S0000044	FOR THREE MONTHS
YOU1000000170_S0000046	I DID MY DAY JOB AND AT NIGHT AND WHENEVER I GOT A CHANCE I KEPT WORKING ON PYTHON
YOU1000000170_S0000047	I BELIEVE THAT WITHIN THREE MONTHS I WAS TO THE POINT WHERE I COULD TELL PEOPLE LOOK HERE THIS IS WHAT I BUILT
YOU1000000170_S0000048	AND IT HAD AN INTERACTIVE INTERPRETER LOOP
YOU1000000170_S0000049	SO THE FIRST DEMOS WERE ALL LET'S ASSIGN AN EXPRESSION TO A VARIABLE AND PRINT IT BACK
YOU1000000170_S0000051	AND LET'S DEFINE A SMALL FUNCTION AND CALL IT AND LET'S PUT SOME LET'S PUT SOME THINGS IN AN ARRAY AND ITERATE OVER THE ARRAY
YOU1000000170_S0000053	AND ALL THOSE THINGS WORKED
YOU1000000170_S0000055	AND
YOU1000000170_S0000057	SOMEHOW AND I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW SORT OF HOW FAST THIS HAPPENED BUT
YOU1000000170_S0000059	CERTAINLY MY TWO OFFICE MATES WERE ALMOST INSTANTLY TAKEN WITH IT AND STARTED HELPING OUT
YOU1000000170_S0000061	AND THEY AND A FEW OTHERS WITHIN THE INSTITUTE WERE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS THING THAT I BUILT
YOU1000000170_S0000063	AND STARTED SORT OF
YOU1000000170_S0000065	OF COURSE WE WE DIDN'T INSTANTLY USE IT ON AMBA BECAUSE IT WASN'T MATURE ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY WRITE THE AMIMA UTILITIES THAT WE WANTED
YOU1000000170_S0000066	BUT IT WAS ALREADY INSTANTLY USEFUL ENOUGH FOR OUR TO TO RUN ON OUR UNIT SYSTEM
YOU1000000170_S0000067	PEOPLE WITHIN EVEN OUTSIDE MY OWN DEPARTMENT STARTED USING IT
YOU1000000170_S0000068	AND RECOGNIZING THAT IT WAS FUN AND PRODUCTIVE TO USE AND THEY USED IT FOR SMALL SCRIPTS
YOU1000000170_S0000069	PEOPLE STARTED CONTRIBUTING THINGS LIKE
YOU1000000170_S0000071	BUG FIXES SOMEHOW THINGS WENT WENT VERY QUICKLY DURING THAT FIRST YEAR
YOU1000000170_S0000072	BECAUSE I THINK BY THE END OF NINETEEN NINETY SO A YEAR AFTER I STARTED WE DEVELOPED A PLAN TO DO AN OPEN SOURCE RELEASE OF THIS LANGUAGE
YOU1000000170_S0000074	AND THIS WAS BEFORE THE WORD OPEN SOURCE HAD EVEN BEEN COINED
YOU1000000170_S0000075	SO WE DIDN'T CALL IT THAT BUT WE DID HAVE SOME MODELS WE HAD LIKE A
YOU1000000170_S0000077	ELEVEN THE WINDOW SYSTEM AT THE TIME
YOU1000000170_S0000078	HAD A DISTRIBUTION THAT WAS ONE OF THE THE SORT OF OPEN SOURCE EXAMPLES
YOU1000000170_S0000079	WITH TWO COLLEAGUES I WORKED ON SORT OF BUILDING A DISTRIBUTION AND WE WE
YOU1000000170_S0000080	ACTUALLY IT TURNED OUT TO BE VERY SIMPLE
YOU1000000170_S0000081	TO GET MANAGEMENT TO SIGN OFF ON THIS RELEASE
YOU1000000170_S0000083	THAT THAT WAS AN INCREDIBLY LUCKY STROKE
YOU1000000170_S0000084	I JUST SORT OF
YOU1000000170_S0000086	I ASKED MY MANAGER'S MANAGER WHAT SHALL WE DO ABOUT THIS
YOU1000000170_S0000087	AND HE SAID OH YOU GOTTA TALK TO THIS AND THIS PERSON IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE BRANCH OF THE INSTITUTE
YOU1000000170_S0000088	I TALKED TO THIS WOMAN AND SHE WAS LIKE IN CHARGE OF ALL LEGAL AFFAIRS I BELIEVE
YOU1000000170_S0000089	AND I SAID WELL I HAVE WRITTEN THIS SOURCE CODE AND I WOULD LIKE TO RELEASE THAT AND I HAVE SORT OF
YOU1000000170_S0000090	MADE UP A LICENSE THAT'S LIKE IDENTICAL TO THE MIT LICENSE IT RELEASES SOFTWARE UNDER EXACTLY THIS LICENSE
YOU1000000170_S0000091	WE JUST PUT LIKE THE FORMAL NAME OF OUR INSTITUTE IN THERE INSTEAD OF THE REGIONS OF THE INSTITUTE
YOU1000000170_S0000092	SHE ASKED ME SOME QUESTIONS LIKE
YOU1000000170_S0000094	DID SOMEONE PAY FOR FOR THIS TO BE DEVELOPED AND MY ANSWER WAS NO I STARTED THIS ALL IN MY OWN MY OWN TIME
YOU1000000170_S0000095	AND IT WAS FOR THIS RESEARCH PROJECT THAT'S SORT OF
YOU1000000170_S0000097	MANAGER IS FINE WITH IT
YOU1000000170_S0000099	AND SO SHE SAID SURE GO AHEAD AND WE DID IT
YOU1000000170_S0000101	AND THAT'S SO THAT IN IN FEBRUARY NINETY ONE WE DID THE FIRST PYTHON RELEASE
YOU1000000170_S0000103	IT FELT LIKE AT THE TIME LIKE AN INCREDIBLE MILESTONE WE NEEDED TO POST IT TO USENET
YOU1000000170_S0000104	THERE WAS THIS USENET NEWS GROUP THAT WOULD RECEIVE SOURCE CODE FOR RANDOM FREE PROJECTS
YOU1000000170_S0000105	I IMMEDIATELY STARTED GETTING USEFUL POSITIVE FEEDBACK FROM WELL INITIALLY JUST FROM RANDOM PEOPLE
YOU1000000170_S0000106	PICKED UP FREE SOFTWARE FROM USENET AND
YOU1000000170_S0000107	WE WE QUICKLY SORT OF GOT INTO A ROUTINE OF DOING NEW PYTHON RELEASES
YOU1000000170_S0000108	AND EVERY TIME
YOU1000000170_S0000110	I MEAN THERE WERE THE OBVIOUS IMPROVEMENTS TO THE LANGUAGE AND THE LIBRARY AND BUG FIXES VERY IMPORTANT CATEGORY OF THINGS THAT WERE OFTEN CONTRIBUTED
YOU1000000170_S0000111	WERE PORTS OR PORTING FIXES WHERE PEOPLE HAD DIFFERENT ARCHITECTURES DIFFERENT COMPILERS
YOU1000000170_S0000112	THE UNIX WORLD WAS MUCH LESS HOMOGENEOUS AT THE TIME THERE WERE LOTS OF SMALL UNIX VENDORS THAT HAD THEIR OWN COMPILERS OR THEIR OWN HARDWARE
YOU1000000170_S0000113	ALL SORTS OF THINGS SO THE THE BIG THINGS THAT HAPPENED
YOU1000000170_S0000114	DURING SAY THE FIRST HALF OF THE NINETY S WAS A COMMUNITY OF PYTHON USERS AND DEVELOPERS SELF ORGANIZED
YOU1000000170_S0000115	THEN CAME THE INVITATION TO COME TO THE UNITED STATES FOR A COUPLE MONTHS
YOU1000000170_S0000117	FROM NEST THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY SO I SPENT TWO MONTHS THERE
YOU1000000170_S0000118	WE ORGANIZED THE FIRST PYTHON WORKSHOP WHICH WAS HOSTED BY IT
YOU1000000170_S0000119	THROUGH THAT PYTHON WORKSHOP I MET PEOPLE WHO OFFERED ME A JOB AND FROM NINETY FIVE I MEAN I WENT BACK TO THE NETHERLANDS FOR A FEW MONTHS AND THEN FROM NINETY FIVE TO TWO THOUSAND
YOU1000000170_S0000120	I WORKED IN THE US IN NORTHERN VIRGINIA AT HER
YOU1000000170_S0000122	AND SO THERE WE WORKED THROUGH A LOT OF GROWTH OF THE COMMUNITY AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE CREATED THE PYTHON WEB SITE
YOU1000000170_S0000123	I GOT IN TOUCH WITH A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL ACTIVE IN THE PYTHON COMMUNITY LIKE BARRY WARSAW
YOU1000000170_S0000124	I THINK WHEN I STARTED THERE PYTHON ONE POINT THREE WAS ABOUT TO BE RELEASED
YOU1000000170_S0000126	AND THEN WHILE I WAS THERE WE RELEASED SEVERAL SUBSEQUENT VERSIONS LEADING UP TO ONE FIVE TWO
YOU1000000170_S0000127	WHICH FOR SOME REASON ONE FIVE ZERO WAS NOTHING
YOU1000000170_S0000128	ONE FIVE TWO REMAINED THE SORT OF THE STANDARD THE GOLD STANDARD OF PYTHON FOR A VERY LONG TIME AFTERWARDS
YOU1000000171_S0000001	BUT GET BACK TO THE STANDARDIZATION WE ARE STANDARDIZING C PLUS PLUS UNDER ISO RULES WHICH ARE VERY OPEN PROCESS
YOU1000000171_S0000002	PEOPLE COME IN THERE'S NO REQUIREMENTS FOR EDUCATION OR EXPERIENCE
YOU1000000171_S0000003	YOU STARTED TO DEVELOP PLUS PLUS AND THERE'S HOPE WHEN WAS THE FIRST STANDARD ESTABLISHED WHAT IS THAT LIKE
YOU1000000171_S0000004	THE ISO STANDARD IS THERE A COMMITTEE THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO THERE'S A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHAT WHAT'S THAT LIKE HOW OFTEN DO YOU MEET THE
YOU1000000171_S0000005	I'LL TRY AND EXPLAIN THAT SO SOMETIME IN EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE
YOU1000000171_S0000006	TWO PEOPLE ONE FROM IBM ONE FROM H TURNED UP IN MY OFFICE AND TOLD ME I WOULD LIKE TO STANDARDIZE C PLUS PLUS
YOU1000000171_S0000008	THIS WAS A NEW IDEA TO ME AND I POINTED OUT THAT IT WASN'T FINISHED YET IT WASN'T READY FOR FORMAL STANDARDIZATION
YOU1000000171_S0000009	AND THEY SAY NO BIANA YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN IT YOU REALLY WANT TO DO THIS IN OUR ORGANIZATIONS DEPEND ON C PLUS PLUS
YOU1000000171_S0000010	WE CANNOT DEPEND ON SOMETHING THAT'S OWNED BY ANOTHER CORPORATION THAT MIGHT BE A COMPETITOR OF COURSE WE COULD RELY ON YOU
YOU1000000171_S0000011	BUT YOU MIGHT GET RUN OVER BY A BUS
YOU1000000171_S0000013	WE REALLY NEED TO GET THIS OUT IN THE OPEN IT HAS TO BE STANDARDIZED UNDER FORMAL RULES
YOU1000000171_S0000014	AND WE WE ARE GOING TO STANDARDIZE IT UNDER ISO RULES
YOU1000000171_S0000015	AND YOU REALLY WANT TO BE PART OF IT BECAUSE BASICALLY OTHERWISE WE'LL DO IT OURSELVES
YOU1000000171_S0000017	AND WE KNOW YOU CAN DO IT BETTER SO THROUGH A COMBINATION OF ARM TWISTING AND FLATTERY
YOU1000000171_S0000019	SO IN LATE
YOU1000000171_S0000021	IN LATE EIGHTY NINE THERE WAS A MEETING IN DC AT THE ACTUALLY NO IT WAS NOT SO THEN IT WAS ANY
YOU1000000171_S0000022	THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS WERE DOING
YOU1000000171_S0000024	WE MET THERE WE WERE LECTURED ON THE RULES OF HOW TO DO AN ANSI STANDARD THERE WAS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE OF US THERE
YOU1000000171_S0000025	WHICH APPARENTLY WAS A NEW RECORD FOR THAT KIND OF MEETING AND SOME OF THE OLD SEA GUYS THAT HAS BEEN STANDARDIZED SEA WAS THERE SO WE GOT SOME EXPERTISE IN
YOU1000000171_S0000026	SO THE WAY THIS WORKS IS THAT IT'S AN OPEN PROCESS ANYBODY CAN CAN SIGN UP IF THEY PAY THE MINIMUM FEE
YOU1000000171_S0000027	WHICH IS ABOUT A THOUSAND DOLLARS LESS THAN A LITTLE BIT MORE NOW
YOU1000000171_S0000028	AND I THINK IT'S TWELVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DOLLARS IT'S NOT IT'S NOT GOING TO KILL YOU AND WE HAVE THREE MEETINGS A YEAR
YOU1000000171_S0000029	IS IS FAIRLY STANDARD WE TRIED TWO MEETINGS A YEAR FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS THAT DIDN'T WORK TOO WELL SO THREE THREE ONE
YOU1000000171_S0000031	MEETINGS A YEAR
YOU1000000171_S0000033	AND YOU MEET AND YOU HAVE TECHNICAL MEET TECHNICAL DISCUSSIONS AND THEN YOU BRING PROPOSALS FORWARD FOR VOTES
YOU1000000171_S0000034	THE VOTES ARE DONE ONE PERSON PER
YOU1000000171_S0000036	ONE VOTE PER ORGANIZATION SO YOU CAN'T HAVE SAY IBM COME IN WITH TEN PEOPLE AND DOMINATE THINGS THAT'S NOT ALLOWED
YOU1000000171_S0000037	AND THESE ARE ORGANIZATIONS THAT EXTENSIVELY USE C PLUS PLUS
YOU1000000171_S0000039	OR INDIVIDUALS
YOU1000000171_S0000040	INDIVIDUALS I MEAN IT'S IT'S A BUNCH OF PEOPLE IN THE ROOM DECIDING THE DESIGN OF A LANGUAGE BASED ON WHICH A LOT OF THE WORLD'S SYSTEMS RUN
YOU1000000171_S0000041	THAT'S RIGHT WELL I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD AGREE IT'S BETTER THAN IF I DECIDED IT
YOU1000000171_S0000042	OR BETTER THAN IF A SINGLE ORGANIZATION LIKE DECIDED IT
YOU1000000171_S0000043	I DON'T KNOW IF EVERYONE AGREES TO THAT BY THE WAY BUREAUCRACIES HAVE THEIR CRITICS TOO
YOU1000000171_S0000044	YES THEY THEY THEY LOOK STANDARDIZATION IS NOT PLEASANT IT'S IT'S IT'S HORRIFYING
YOU1000000171_S0000045	IT'S LIKE DEMOCRACY
YOU1000000171_S0000046	EXACTLY AS CHURCHILL SAYS DEMOCRACY IS THE WORST WAY EXCEPT FOR THE OTHERS RIGHT
YOU1000000171_S0000047	AND IT'S I WOULD SAY THE SAME WITH FORMAL STANDARDIZATION BUT ANYWAY SO WE MEET AND WE WE HAVE THESE VOTES
YOU1000000171_S0000049	AND THAT DETERMINES WHAT THE STANDARD IS A COUPLE OF YEARS LATER WE EXTENDED THIS SO IT BECAME WORLDWIDE
YOU1000000171_S0000050	WE HAVE STANDARD ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE ACTIVE IN
YOU1000000171_S0000052	CURRENTLY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY COUNTRIES AND ANOTHER
YOU1000000171_S0000054	FIFTEEN TO TWENTY ARE SORT OF LOOKING AND VOTING
YOU1000000171_S0000056	BASED ON THE REST OF THE WORK ON IT AND WE MEET THREE TIMES A YEAR NEXT WEEK I'LL BE IN COLOGNE GERMANY
YOU1000000171_S0000057	SPENDING A WEEK DOING STANDARDIZATION THEN WE WILL VOTE OUT THE COMMITTEE DRAFT OR C PLUS PLUS TWENTY
YOU1000000171_S0000059	WHICH GOES TO THE NATIONAL STANDARDS COMMITTEES FOR COMMENTS AND REQUESTS FOR CHANGES
YOU1000000171_S0000060	IMPROVEMENTS THEN WE DO THAT AND THERE'S A SECOND SET OF VOTES WHERE HOPEFULLY EVERYBODY VOTES IN FAVOR THIS HAS HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES
YOU1000000171_S0000061	FIRST TIME WE FINISHED WE STARTED IN THE FIRST TECHNICAL MEETING WAS IN NINETEEN NINETY THE LAST WAS IN NINETY EIGHT
YOU1000000171_S0000062	WE VOTED IT OUT THAT WAS THE STANDARD THAT PEOPLE USED TILL ELEVEN OR A LITTLE BIT PAST ELEVEN AND IT WAS AN INTERNATIONAL STANDARD
YOU1000000171_S0000063	ALL THE COUNTRIES VOTED IN FAVOUR IT TOOK LONGER WITH ELEVEN AND I'LL MENTION WHY
YOU1000000171_S0000064	BUT ALL THE NATIONS VOTED IN FAVOR AND WE WORK ON THE BASIS OF CONSENSUS
YOU1000000171_S0000065	THAT IS WE DO NOT WANT SOMETHING THAT PASSES SIXTY FORTY BECAUSE THEN WE'RE GETTING GETTING DIALECTS AND OPPONENTS AND PEOPLE COMPLAIN TOO MUCH
YOU1000000171_S0000066	THEY ALL COMPLAIN TOO MUCH BUT BASICALLY IT HAS NO REAL EFFECT THE STANDARD HAS BEEN OBEYED
YOU1000000171_S0000067	THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING TO MAKE IT EASIER TO USE MANY COMPILERS MANY COMPUTERS AND ALL OF THAT KIND OF STUFF
YOU1000000171_S0000069	AND SO THE FIRST THAT IT WAS TRADITIONAL WITH ISO STANDARD TO TAKE TEN YEARS WE DID THE FIRST ONE AND EIGHT BRILLIANT
YOU1000000171_S0000071	AND WE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO DO THE NEXT ONE IN SIX BECAUSE NOW WE'RE GOOD AT IT
YOU1000000171_S0000072

YOU1000000171_S0000077	IT WAS NAMED HOPING THAT YOU WOULD AT LEAST GET IT WITHIN THE SINGLE WITHIN THE AS THE SINGLE
YOU1000000171_S0000078	I THOUGHT WE WOULD GET I THOUGHT WE WOULD GET SIX SEVEN EIGHT THE CONFIDENCE OF YOUTH
YOU1000000171_S0000079	THAT'S RIGHT WELL THE POINT IS THAT THIS WAS SORT OF LIKE A SECOND SYSTEM EFFECT THAT IS WE NOW KNEW HOW TO DO IT AND SO WE'RE GOING TO DO IT MUCH BETTER
YOU1000000171_S0000080	AND WE GOT MORE AMBITIOUS AMBITION AND IT TOOK LONGER FURTHERMORE THERE IS THIS TENDENCY BECAUSE IT'S A TEN YEAR CYCLE
YOU1000000171_S0000082	EACH DOESN'T MATTER
YOU1000000171_S0000084	JUST BEFORE YOU'RE ABOUT TO SHIP SOMEBODY HAS A BRIGHT IDEA
YOU1000000171_S0000086

YOU1000000171_S0000091	WE DID THAT SUCCESSFULLY WITH THE ST
YOU1000000171_S0000093	STUFF THAT THAT BASICALLY I THINK IT SAVED
YOU1000000171_S0000094	PLUS PLUS IT WAS BEAUTIFUL
YOU1000000171_S0000095	YEAH AND THEN PEOPLE TRIED IT WITH OTHER THINGS AND IT DIDN'T WORK SO WELL THEY GOT THINGS IN BUT IT WASN'T AS AS DRAMATIC

YOU1000000171_S0000100	WE DECIDED NEVER AGAIN
YOU1000000171_S0000102	AND SO HOW DO YOU AVOID THOSE SLIPS AND THE ANSWER IS THAT YOU SHIP MORE OFTEN
YOU1000000171_S0000103	SO THAT IF YOU IF YOU IF YOU HAVE A SLIP ON THE TEN YEAR CYCLE
YOU1000000171_S0000105	BY THE TIME YOU KNOW IT'S A SLIP THERE'S ELEVEN YEARS TILL YOU GET IT

YOU1000000175_S0000003	PROFESSOR AT STANFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND DIRECTOR OF THE STANFORD CENTER FOR HEALTH COMMUNICATION AND I'M GOING TO DEBUNK SOME ILLNESS AND DISEASE MYTHS
YOU1000000175_S0000005	PEOPLE KIND OF WANT TO KNOW LIKE EXACTLY HOW MUCH WATER SHOULD I BE DRINKING BUT THERE ISN'T THAT MAGIC NUMBER
YOU1000000175_S0000006	I THINK THIS MYTH HAS BEEN CIRCULATING FOR A LONG TIME AND SOMEHOW EIGHT GLASSES OF AN EIGHT OUNCE GLASS SPECIFICALLY IS WHAT CIRCULATED
YOU1000000175_S0000007	DEPENDS ON YOUR BODY SIZE AND HOW ACTIVE YOU ARE A GIVEN TIME
YOU1000000175_S0000009	THERE IS NO REASON TO EAT YOUR PLACENTA I DO HEAR FROM PEOPLE THAT THEY WANT TO EAT THEIR PLACENTA
YOU1000000175_S0000010	BECAUSE MONKEYS OR OTHER WILD ANIMALS DO IT BUT THE REASON THAT THOSE ANIMALS ARE DOING IT IS BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO ATTRACT PREDATORS
YOU1000000175_S0000011	THERE IS NO REASON FOR A HUMAN TO EAT A PLACENTA
YOU1000000175_S0000013	YOUR HEART DOES NOT SKIP A BEAT WHEN YOU SNEEZE I THINK A LOT OF US GROW UP HEARING THINGS ABOUT SNEEZING THAT YOUR EYES CLOSE
YOU1000000175_S0000014	AND YOUR HEART SKIP A BEAT AND YOU'RE LIKE DEAD FOR A MILLISECOND OR SOMETHING YEAH CLEARLY NOT TRUE
YOU1000000175_S0000016	ADULTS HAVE FEWER BONES THAN BABIES AND THAT'S ACTUALLY TRUE BECAUSE BABIES ARE BORN WITH SOME BONES THAT FUSE TO BECOME A BIGGER BONE
YOU1000000175_S0000018	THERE IS A PHENOMENON KNOWN AS THE JULY EFFECT WHICH WANDERS AND ASK THIS QUESTION THAT IF YOU HAVE MASSIVE TURNOVER
YOU1000000175_S0000019	NEW RESIDENTS STARTING NEW FACULTY STARTING AROUND JULY THEN ISN'T THAT A MORE DANGEROUS TIME TO BE IN HOSPITAL AND THERE HAVE BEEN THREE HUNDRED STUDIES LOOKING INTO THIS
YOU1000000175_S0000020	AND IT TURNS OUT THAT IT DEPENDS ON WHAT KIND OF HOSPITAL IS WHO YOU'RE BEING LOOKED AFTER LIKE HOW EXPERIENCED THEY ARE BUT ALSO WHAT KIND OF ILLNESS YOU ARE AND HOW SERIOUSLY SICK YOU ARE
YOU1000000175_S0000021	THE TAKE HOME FROM THIS IS THAT IF YOU'RE SICK IN JULY YOU STILL NEED TO GO TO A HOSPITAL AND BY AND LARGE YOU'RE IN GOOD HANDS
YOU1000000175_S0000023	SO YOUR BODY MAKES TOXINS AS IT METABOLIZES DIFFERENT THINGS BUT THE THING IS YOUR BODY ALSO FLUSHES THOSE THINGS OUT
YOU1000000175_S0000024	YOU DON'T NEED TO BE DOING ANYTHING OR TAKING ANYTHING TO CLEANSE YOURSELF FLATTEN IT IS MOST OF THEM ARE NOT GOOD FOR YOU
YOU1000000175_S0000025	THEY KIND OF GO UNDER THIS UMBRELLA OF OH WELL IT'S NATURAL OR IT'S HERE BUT THOSE HERBS ARE NO JOKE SOMETIMES FLAT TUMMY CONTAIN CAN
YOU1000000175_S0000026	WHICH YES IT'S A HERB BUT IT'S ALSO A LAXATIVE SO IF YOU WANT TO CRAP THE WAY OUT I MEAN ALL YOU'RE DOING IS EMPTYING YOUR BOWELS AND BECOMING DEHYDRATED
YOU1000000175_S0000028	YOUR BODY DOES HAVE WASTE PRODUCTS IN IT THAT'S WHY YOU AND THAT'S WHY YOU POOP AND EVEN WHEN YOU BREATHE YOU ARE EXHALING CARBON DIOXIDE WHICH IS A WASTE PRODUCT
YOU1000000175_S0000029	YOUR BODY IS PERFECTLY PRIMED TO DO THAT TO GET RID OF WHAT YOU DON'T NEED PEOPLE DO ASK ABOUT COLONICS YOU DO NOT NEED THEM
YOU1000000175_S0000030	YOU DO NOT NEED TO PUT COFFEE UP YOUR BUTT YOU DON'T NEED TO BE SHOVING LIQUIDS UP THERE TO GET ANYTHING OUT UNLESS OF COURSE YOU HAVE CONSTIPATION AND THE DOCTOR PRESCRIBES AN ENEMY BUT IF YOU'RE HEALTHY AND FUNCTIONING FINE THEN YOU DON'T NEED TO DO A CLINIC
YOU1000000175_S0000032	PEOPLE ARE MAKING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS THAT MANY OF US DON'T NEED AND THAT INCLUDES VITAMINS
YOU1000000175_S0000033	IF YOU ARE EATING A WELL BALANCED DIET YOU'RE GETTING THE VITAMINS THAT YOU NEED AND YOU DON'T NEED TO BE POPPING A PILL TO STAY HEALTHY
YOU1000000175_S0000034	YOU NEED TO TAKE A VITAMIN IF YOUR HEALTHCARE PROVIDER TELLS YOU YOU HAVE A DEFICIENCY AND YOU NEED TO TOP UP AND TAKE A PILL OR TAKE A LIQUID THAT BOOSTS YOUR LEVEL OF THAT VITAMIN
YOU1000000175_S0000036	MS G IS NOT ADDICTIVE IT'S NOT UNSAFE AND THE THING THAT I WAS FASCINATED WITH WHEN I WAS WRITING THIS WAS THAT THOSE MYTHS THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT MS
YOU1000000175_S0000037	THAT IT'S ADDICTIVE THAT IT'S REALLY BAD FOR YOU ARE ALL TIED TO RACISM AND THE FACT THAT IT WAS CHINESE PEOPLE OWNING CHINESE RESTAURANTS THAT WERE USING IT AND THAT'S HOW IT GOT LABELED AS SOMETHING THAT WAS DIRTY AND TOXIC
YOU1000000175_S0000038	IN MODERATION IT'S NO WORSE FOR YOU THAN REGULAR SALT
YOU1000000175_S0000040	PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ME IF GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOOD IS SAFE OR I SHOULD PAY MORE FOR NON GMO FOOD PAY MORE FOR ORGANIC FOOD BUT GMO FOOD IS SAFE
YOU1000000175_S0000041	AND THE DEFINITION OF ORGANIC HONESTLY CAN BE SO BROAD AND VAGUE AND DIFFERENT FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER THAT MOST DOCTORS WILL SAY
YOU1000000175_S0000042	JUST EAT A HEALTHY BALANCED VARIED DIET AND YOU DON'T NECESSARILY NEED TO PAY MORE FOR ORGANIC FOR MOST FOODS
YOU1000000175_S0000044	I DO GET ASKED ABOUT ARTIFICIAL SWEETNESS A LOT BECAUSE A LOT OF MY FRIENDS LIKE TO CHUG DIET SODAS THE THING TO BEAR IN MIND HERE IS THAT SOME OF THE STUDIES ARE NOT THAT ROBUST
YOU1000000175_S0000045	SO YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN HEADLINES SAYING DIET SODAS CAUSE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE OR DIET SODA CAUSES STROKE
YOU1000000175_S0000046	AND THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY TRUE AND THE THING THAT I WORRY ABOUT THEN IS WELL PEOPLE DITCH THE DIET SODA AND JUST START DRINKING SUGARY SODA WHEN WE KNOW THAT THOSE ARE LINKED TO DIABETES AND OTHER ILLNESSES
YOU1000000175_S0000047	ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS THE KIND THAT YOU FIND IN DIET SODAS DO NOT CAUSE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
YOU1000000175_S0000049	STROKE AND CANCER YOU MAY HAVE SEEN HEADLINES THAT SAY THAT BUT I THINK THAT THEY ARE MISCONSTRUING WHAT THE SCIENTIFIC STUDIES ARE REALLY SHOWING
YOU1000000175_S0000050	THERE HAVE BEEN STUDIES SHOWING SOME HARMFUL EFFECTS OF ARTIFICIAL SWEETNESS IN RATS
YOU1000000175_S0000051	BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO TAKE THAT WITH A LARGE GRAIN OF SALT TO SAY THAT WELL JUST BECAUSE IT DID SOMETHING IN RODENTS BODY WILL THAT TRANSLATE INTO HAPPENING IN A HUMAN'S BODY
YOU1000000175_S0000052	BUT IF YOU WANT TO BE REALLY CAREFUL YOU CAN JUST DRINK WATER
YOU1000000175_S0000055	GREAT MESSAGE
YOU1000000175_S0000057	YOU ARE A LITTLE BIT TALLER FIRST THING IN THE MORNING PROBABLY NO MORE THAN A CENTIMETRE THOUGH AND THAT'S JUST BECAUSE GRAVITY COMPRESSES YOUR JOINTS DURING THE COURSE OF THE DAY
YOU1000000175_S0000058	IT'S ALSO WHY WHEN ASTRONAUTS COME BACK TO EARTH AFTER A SPACE MISSION THEY ARE A LITTLE BIT TALLER THAN WHEN THEY LEFT EARTH
YOU1000000175_S0000060	THERE ARE STUDIES SHOWING THAT BAD TEETH ESPECIALLY BAD GUMS CAN LEAD TO HEART DISEASE AND MAKE YOU MORE SUSCEPTIBLE AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE BACTERIA
YOU1000000175_S0000061	THAT CAUSES GUM DISEASE CAN CIRCULATE THROUGH THE BLOOD AND CAUSE ILLNESS ELSEWHERE IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT MAKES US LOOK AT THE PATIENT HOLISTICALLY
YOU1000000175_S0000062	IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE CHECKED AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO EAT WELL BUT IT'S ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT TO GET GOOD DENTAL HYGIENE AND GET ROUTINE CHECKUP TO MAKE SURE YOUR GUMS ARE AS HEALTHY AS EVERYTHING ELSE
YOU1000000175_S0000064	THERE ARE SOME STUDIES THAT ARE QUITE EXCITING THAT SHOW THAT ASPIRIN WHICH WE ALREADY RECOMMEND FOR A NUMBER OF THINGS MIGHT LOWER THE RISK OF CANCER
YOU1000000175_S0000065	BUT THERE'S STILL MORE RESEARCH BEING DONE AND THERE AREN'T A TON OF MEDICAL ORGANIZATIONS SAYING HEY EVERYONE SHOULD TAKE AN ASPIRIN PILL EVERY DAY TO PREVENT CANCER
YOU1000000175_S0000066	WHAT WE'RE LEARNING IS THAT IT'S CERTAIN TYPES OF CANCER IN PARTICULAR AND THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING ABOUT ASPIRIN THAT PREVENTS METASTATIC CANCER THAT PREVENTS CANCER CELLS FROM MOVING AROUND THE BODY
YOU1000000175_S0000067	BUT EVEN IN THAT CASE IT MIGHT BE THAT THE ASPIRIN WORKS FOR THAT ONLY IN SOME PEOPLE AND NOT IN EVERYONE
YOU1000000175_S0000068	I GET SO MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT ASPIRIN BECAUSE IT FEELS LIKE EVERY YEAR WE DISCOVER A NEW USE FOR IT IT IS AN INCREDIBLE INCREDIBLE DRUG
YOU1000000175_S0000069	BUT THE JURY'S STILL OUT ON ASPIRIN PREVENTING CANCER
YOU1000000175_S0000071	PLEASE DO NOT STOP TAKING AN ANTIBIOTIC THE MOMENT YOU FEEL BETTER IF YOU STILL HAVE MORE TO COMPLETE THE COURSE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT IF YOU HAVE TEN DAYS OF PILLS
YOU1000000175_S0000072	BUT YOU FEEL BETTER ON DAY FOUR OR DAY THREE EVEN YOU STILL HAVE TO FINISH THAT COURSE OF ANTIBIOTICS SO THAT THE BUG DOES NOT BECOME RESISTANT TO THE MEDICINE
YOU1000000175_S0000074	ANTIBIOTICS CANNOT HELP WITH A COLD MOST COLDS MOST SORE THROATS ARE CAUSED BY VIRUSES AND ANTIBIOTICS WILL NOT DO ANYTHING TO THOSE
YOU1000000175_S0000075	ANTIBIOTICS FIGHT BACTERIA VERY SPECIFICALLY SO IF YOU HAVE A VIRUS CIRCULATING IN YOUR BLOOD TAKING AN ANTIBIOTIC WILL NOT HELP
YOU1000000175_S0000077	IT'S BEEN CIRCULATING FOR AGES THAT YOU SHOULD STARVE A FEVER AND FEED A COLD YOU JUST NEED TO EAT WELL AND STAY HYDRATED WHEN YOU'RE NOT WELL
YOU1000000175_S0000078	IT IS DANGEROUS TO STARVE YOURSELF LIKE THAT'S A THING THAT WE KNOW THAT'S PROVEN SO IF YOU HAVE A FEVER STAY HYDRATED AND EAT WELL
YOU1000000175_S0000080	FLU SHOT CAN DEFINITELY NOT CAUSE THE FLU THE FLU SHOT MIGHT MAKE YOU BUT FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF US GETTING THE FLU SHOT IS A FANTASTIC IDEA
YOU1000000175_S0000081	YOU WILL NOT GET THE FLU FROM IT AND IT WILL KEEP YOU SAFE
YOU1000000175_S0000083	I THINK WE ALL GREW UP HEARING THAT YOU SHOULD NEVER GO OUTSIDE IN THE COLD WHEN YOUR HAIR IS WET OR LIKE MAKE SURE YOU BUNDLE UP AND OUR MOTHERS LOVE DOING THAT TO US
YOU1000000175_S0000084	DURING COLD TIMES IS WHEN THERE ARE MORE COLD BUGS CIRCULATING ANYWAY AND ALSO THERE IS SOME RESEARCH THAT SHOWS THAT COLD WEATHER MIGHT IMPACT THE IMMUNE SYSTEM
YOU1000000175_S0000085	I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THAT ROBUST I THINK IT'S STILL A GOOD IDEA THOUGH TO WRAP UP VERY WARM
YOU1000000175_S0000087	YOU DO NOT LOSE MORE HEAT FROM YOUR HEAD THAN ANYWHERE ELSE ON YOUR BODY
YOU1000000175_S0000089	YOU CAN TELL A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT'S MAKING SOMEBODY SICK FROM LOOKING AT THE COLOR OF THEIR FUTURE WHICH IS THE DISGUSTING THING THAT YOU COUGH UP
YOU1000000175_S0000090	FOR EXAMPLE IF IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT'S LESS LIKELY TO BE AN INFECTION USUALLY IF IT'S GREEN OR YELLOW MORE LIKELY TO BE A BACTERIAL VIRAL INFECTION
YOU1000000175_S0000091	I THINK DOCTORS ARE GOOD AT ASSESSING THE COLOR OF PUTIN WHEN PEOPLE ARE COUGHING UP OUT OF THEIR LUNGS IF YOU ARE EMPTYING YOUR NOSE INTO A TISSUE
YOU1000000175_S0000092	PROBABLY LOOKING AT THE COLOR TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT BACTERIA IS CAUSING IT THAT'S NOT GONNA BE SOMETHING YOU CAN ASSESS
YOU1000000175_S0000094	PEOPLE WONDER IF THEIR EARS STOP GROWING WHEN THE REST OF THEM STOPS GROWING AND ACTUALLY YOUR EARS CARRY ON GROWING FOREVER
YOU1000000175_S0000096	THE CURRENT GUIDELINES IN THE US ARE THAT MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN CAN ONLY DONATE BLOOD IF THEY'VE BEEN CELIBATE FOR TWELVE MONTHS WHICH IS LUDICROUS AND STUPID AND UNSCIENTIFIC
YOU1000000175_S0000097	IT WASN'T UNTIL TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN THIRTY YEARS AFTER WE HAD A TEST FOR HIV AIDS
YOU1000000175_S0000098	THAT GAY MEN AND BISEXUAL MEN WERE TOLD YES YOU CAN DONATE BLOOD BUT THERE WAS A MAJOR CAVEAT
YOU1000000175_S0000099	AND THAT CAVEAT WAS THAT MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN COULD ONLY DONATE BLOOD IF THEY HAD BEEN CELIBATE FOR TWELVE MONTHS
YOU1000000175_S0000101	VACCINES DO NOT CAUSE AUTISM I MAY GET THAT TATTOOED ON MY FACE AT SOME POINT IN TWENTY TWENTY I'M KIND OF BEING SARCASTIC HERE
YOU1000000175_S0000102	BUT IF A PATIENT WAS TO ASK ME THAT I WOULD TAKE THEIR CONCERNS REALLY SERIOUSLY AND NOT BE DISMISSIVE BECAUSE I WANT TO KNOW WHY THEY THINK THAT AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I REASSURE THEM
YOU1000000175_S0000103	THAT VACCINES ARE SAFE AND WHAT THEY CAUSE IS A LONG LIFE AND GOOD HEALTH
YOU1000000175_S0000105	THE BEST WAY TO DISINFECT YOUR HANDS IS TO WASH THEM VERY WELL WITH WATER AND SOAP AND THEN TO RUB THEM CLEAN
YOU1000000175_S0000107	HAND SANITIZERS GOOD IF YOU'RE IN A BIND BUT IT'S NOWHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS WASHING YOUR HANDS WITH SOAP AND WATER I GET ASKED A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT ALCOHOL GO
YOU1000000175_S0000108	HAND SANITIZER AND LIKE DISINFECTANT WIPES AND THEY ARE REALLY USEFUL THEY DO DISINFECT SURFACES
YOU1000000175_S0000109	BUT NOTHING IS EQUIVALENT TO DISINFECTING YOUR HANDS AS WASHING THEM WITH SOAP AND WATER
YOU1000000175_S0000111	IT'S TRUE THAT MANY PATIENTS CARED FOR BY FEMALE DOCTOR HAVE BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES THERE'VE BEEN A NUMBER OF STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT PATIENTS DO BETTER
YOU1000000175_S0000112	THEY LIVE LONGER THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO BE READMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL IF THEY ARE CARED FOR BY A DOCTOR WHO IS A WOMAN
YOU1000000175_S0000113	AND AT THE SAME TIME WOMEN DOCTORS FACE LOTS OF DISCRIMINATION AND GET PAID LESS THAN OUR MALE COUNTERPARTS
YOU1000000175_S0000115	IT'S HARD TO AVOID MISINFORMATION SOMETIMES THERE IS SO MUCH FALSE HEALTH NEWS CIRCULATING
YOU1000000175_S0000116	AND SOMETIMES YOU CAN JUST FEEL OVERWHELMED EVEN WITH THE CORRECT INFORMATION I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING TO DO IS TO TALK TO A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER THAT YOU FEEL LIKE YOU CAN TRUST
YOU1000000175_S0000117	WHO HAS AN OPEN MIND AND SOMEONE THAT GIVES YOU THE TIME AND SPACE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT'S REALLY CONCERNING YOU
YOU1000000176_S0000001	CELLS ARE THE SMALLEST LIVING UNITS OF AN ORGANISM
YOU1000000176_S0000003	ALL CELLS HAVE THREE THINGS IN COMMON NO MATTER WHAT TYPE OF CELL THEY ARE
YOU1000000176_S0000005	ALL CELLS HAVE A CELL MEMBRANE WHICH SEPARATES THE INSIDE OF THE CELL FROM ITS ENVIRONMENT
YOU1000000176_S0000007	CYTOPLASM WHICH IS A JELLY LIKE FLUID AND DNA WHICH IS THE CELL'S GENETIC MATERIAL
YOU1000000176_S0000009	THERE ARE TWO BROAD CATEGORIES OF CELLS
YOU1000000176_S0000011	THE FIRST CATEGORY IS EUKARYOTIC CELLS THEY HAVE ORGANELLES WHICH INCLUDE THE NUCLEUS AND OTHER SPECIAL PARTS
YOU1000000176_S0000013	EUKARYOTIC CELLS ARE MORE ADVANCED COMPLEX CELLS SUCH AS THOSE FOUND IN PLANTS AND ANIMALS
YOU1000000176_S0000015	THE SECOND CATEGORY IS PROKARYOTIC CELLS
YOU1000000176_S0000016	THEY DON'T HAVE A NUCLEUS OR MEMBRANE ENCLOSED ORGANELLES
YOU1000000176_S0000017	THEY DO HAVE GENETIC MATERIAL BUT IT'S NOT CONTAINED WITHIN A NUCLEUS
YOU1000000176_S0000018	PROKARYOTIC CELLS ARE ALWAYS ONESELF OR UNICELLULAR ORGANISMS SUCH AS BACTERIA
YOU1000000176_S0000020	SO WHAT ARE ORGANELLES
YOU1000000176_S0000021	ORGAN MEANS LITTLE ORGAN
YOU1000000176_S0000023	ORGANELLES ARE THE SPECIALIZED PARTS OF A CELL THAT HAVE UNIQUE JOBS TO PERFORM
YOU1000000176_S0000025	LET'S START WITH THE NUCLEUS THE CONTROL CENTRE OF THE CELL
YOU1000000176_S0000027	THE NUCLEUS CONTAINS DNA OR GENETIC MATERIAL
YOU1000000176_S0000028	DNA DICTATES WHAT THE CELL IS GOING TO DO AND HOW IT'S GOING TO DO IT
YOU1000000176_S0000029	CHROMATIN IS THE TANGLED SPREAD OUT FORM OF DNA FOUND INSIDE THE NUCLEAR MEMBRANE
YOU1000000176_S0000031	WHEN A CELL IS READY TO DIVIDE DNA CONDENSES INTO STRUCTURES KNOWN AS CHROMOSOMES
YOU1000000176_S0000033	THE NUCLEUS ALSO CONTAINS A NUCLEOLUS
YOU1000000176_S0000035	WHICH IS A STRUCTURE WHERE RIBOSOMES ARE MADE
YOU1000000176_S0000037	AFTER RIBOSOMES LEAVE THE NUCLEUS THEY WILL HAVE THE IMPORTANT JOB OF SYNTHESIZING OR MAKING PROTEINS
YOU1000000176_S0000039	OUTSIDE THE NUCLEUS THE RIBOSOMES AND THE REST OF THE ORGANELLES FLOAT AROUND IN CYTOPLASM WHICH IS THE JELLY LIKE SUBSTANCE
YOU1000000176_S0000041	RIBOSOMES MAY WANDER FREELY WITHIN THE CYTOPLASM
YOU1000000176_S0000043	OR ATTACH TO THE ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM SOMETIMES ABBREVIATED AS
YOU1000000176_S0000044	THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF ROUGHER HAS RIBOSOMES ATTACHED TO IT
YOU1000000176_S0000045	AND SMOOTHER DOESN'T HAVE RIBOSOMES ATTACHED TO IT
YOU1000000176_S0000047	THE ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM IS A MEMBRANE ENCLOSED PASSAGEWAY FOR TRANSPORTING MATERIALS SUCH AS THE PROTEIN SYNTHESIZED BY RIBOSOMES
YOU1000000176_S0000049	PROTEINS AND OTHER MATERIALS EMERGE FROM THE ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM IN SMALL VESICLES
YOU1000000176_S0000051	WHERE THE GOLGI APPARATUS SOMETIMES CALLED THE GOLGI BODY RECEIVES THEM
YOU1000000176_S0000053	AS PROTEINS MOVE THROUGH THE GOLGI BODY THEY'RE CUSTOMIZED INTO FORMS THAT THE CELL CAN USE
YOU1000000176_S0000055	THE GOLGI BODY DOES THIS BY FOLDING THE PROTEINS INTO USABLE SHAPES
YOU1000000176_S0000056	OR ADDING OTHER MATERIALS ONTO THEM SUCH AS LIPIDS
YOU1000000176_S0000058	OR CARBOHYDRATES
YOU1000000176_S0000060	VACUOLES ARE SACK LIKE STRUCTURES THAT STORE DIFFERENT MATERIALS
YOU1000000176_S0000061	HERE IN THIS PLANT CELL THE CENTRAL VACUOLE STORES WATER
YOU1000000176_S0000063	GOING BACK TO THE ANIMAL CELL YOU WILL SEE AN ORGANELLE CALLED A LYSOSOME
YOU1000000176_S0000064	LYSOSOMES ARE THE GARBAGE COLLECTORS THAT TAKE IN DAMAGED OR WORN OUT CELL PARTS
YOU1000000176_S0000065	THEY ARE FILLED WITH ENZYMES THAT BREAK DOWN THE CELLULAR DEBRIS
YOU1000000176_S0000067	THE MITOCHONDRIA IS AN ORGANELLE THAT IS THE POWERHOUSE FOR BOTH ANIMAL AND PLANT CELLS
YOU1000000176_S0000069	DURING A PROCESS CALLED CELLULAR RESPIRATION THE MITOCHONDRIA MAKE ATP MOLECULES THAT PROVIDE THE ENERGY FOR ALL OF THE CELLS ACTIVITIES
YOU1000000176_S0000071	CELLS THAT NEED MORE ENERGY HAVE MORE MITOCHONDRIA
YOU1000000176_S0000073	MEANWHILE THE CELL MAINTAINS ITS SHAPE THROUGH A CYTOSKELETON
YOU1000000176_S0000075	THE CYTOSKELETON INCLUDES THE THREAD LIKE MICRO FILAMENTS WHICH ARE MADE OF PROTEIN
YOU1000000176_S0000077	AND MICROTUBULES WHICH ARE THIN HOLLOW TUBES
YOU1000000176_S0000079	SOME ORGANISMS SUCH AS PLANTS THAT ARE PHOTO AUTOTROPHIC
YOU1000000176_S0000081	MEANING THEY CAPTURE SUNLIGHT FOR ENERGY
YOU1000000176_S0000083	HAVE CELLS WITH AN ORGANELLE CALLED A CHLOROPLAST
YOU1000000176_S0000085	CHLOROPLAST IS WHERE PHOTOSYNTHESIS HAPPENS
YOU1000000176_S0000087	IT'S GREEN BECAUSE IT HAS A GREEN PIGMENT CALLED CHLOROPHYLL
YOU1000000176_S0000089	PLANT CELLS ALSO HAVE A CELL WALL OUTSIDE OF THEIR CELL MEMBRANES THAT SHAPE SUPPORT AND PROTECT THE PLANT CELL
YOU1000000176_S0000091	ANIMAL CELLS NEVER HAVE A CELL WALL
YOU1000000176_S0000093	THERE ARE MANY OTHER UNIQUE STRUCTURES THAT ONLY SOME CELLS HAVE
YOU1000000176_S0000095	HERE ARE JUST A FEW IN HUMANS FOR EXAMPLE THE RESPIRATORY TRACT IS LINED WITH CELLS THAT HAVE SELIA
YOU1000000176_S0000096	THESE ARE MICROSCOPIC HAIR LIKE PROJECTIONS THAT CAN MOVE IN WAVES
YOU1000000176_S0000097	THIS FEATURE HELPS TRAP INHALED PARTICLES IN THE AIR AND EXPELS THEM WHEN YOU COUGH
YOU1000000176_S0000099	ANOTHER UNIQUE FEATURE IN SOME CELLS IS FLAGELLA SOME BACTERIA HAVE FLAGELLA
YOU1000000176_S0000100	A FLAGELLUM IS LIKE A LITTLE TAIL THAT CAN HELP A CELL MOVE OR PROPEL ITSELF
YOU1000000176_S0000102	THE ONLY HUMAN CELL THAT HAS A FLAGELLUM IS A SPERM CELL
YOU1000000176_S0000104	IN SUMMARY REMEMBER
YOU1000000176_S0000105	EUKARYOTIC CELLS ARE PLANT AND ANIMAL CELLS WITH A NUCLEUS AND MEMBRANE ENCLOSED ORGANELLES
YOU1000000176_S0000107	WHILE PROKARYOTIC CELLS ARE UNICELLULAR ORGANISMS WITHOUT THESE THINGS
YOU1000000176_S0000109	ALL CELLS HAVE A CELL MEMBRANE CYTOPLASM AND GENETIC MATERIAL
YOU1000000176_S0000111	AND EVEN THOUGH ONLY PLANT CELLS HAVE CHLOROPLASTS BOTH PLANT AND ANIMAL CELLS HAVE MITOCHONDRIA
YOU1000000177_S0000000	COFFEE DID YOU KNOW THAT OVER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION CUPS OF COFFEE ARE CONSUMED EVERY YEAR
YOU1000000177_S0000001	COFFEE ALSO KNOWN AROUND MY HOUSE AS LIQUID GOLD IS THE SECOND MOST TRADED COMMODITY IN THE WORLD ONLY BEHIND OIL IN TODAY'S VIDEO I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU WHY COFFEE IS NOT BAD FOR YOU
YOU1000000177_S0000002	AND THE NINE SCIENTIFIC BENEFITS TO HAVING A DAILY CUP OF JOE
YOU1000000177_S0000003	I WILL ALSO FINISH WITH SOME SHORT FACES ABOUT THE BEST TIMES TO DRINK COFFEE HOW MUCH PER DAY IS OKAY AND HOW MUCH IS TOO MUCH
YOU1000000177_S0000004	WHEN PEOPLE SAY COFFEE IS BAD FOR YOU THEY OFTEN POINT TO A FEW THINGS INSOMNIA DEHYDRATION AND ADRENAL FATIGUE
YOU1000000177_S0000005	INSOMNIA IS USUALLY JUST A RESULT OF DRINKING COFFEE TOO EARLY SINCE EFFECTS CAN LAST UP TO TEN HOURS AFTER DRINKING SIMPLY STOP DRINKING COFFEE BEFORE NOON AND YOU SHOULD BE FINE
YOU1000000177_S0000006	DEHYDRATION YES COFFEE IS A NATURAL DIABETIC BUT THIS PROBLEM IS CURED BY DRINKING MORE WATER WHICH YOU SHOULD BE DOING ANYWAY
YOU1000000177_S0000007	AND ADRENAL FATIGUE THIS IS NOT EVEN A REAL MEDICAL CONDITION ANYONE SPOUTING THIS SORT OF NONSENSE DOESN'T DESERVE YOUR TIME OR ATTENTION
YOU1000000177_S0000008	HERE ARE THE PROVEN BENEFITS OF DRINKING COFFEE BACKED BY SCIENTIFIC STUDIES NUMBER ONE COFFEE CAN HELP YOU BURN FAT
YOU1000000177_S0000009	CAFFEINE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BOOST METABOLISM BY UP TO ELEVEN PERCENT AND DRAMATICALLY INCREASE FAT BURNING POTENTIAL
YOU1000000177_S0000010	OTHER STUDIES HAVE EVEN SHOWN THAT THE RATE OF FAT BEING BURNED WHILE DRINKING CAFFEINE CAN IMPROVE BY TEN PERCENT IN OBESE INDIVIDUALS AND TWENTY NINE PERCENT IN LEAN INDIVIDUALS
YOU1000000177_S0000011	NUMBER TWO COFFEE HELPS YOU EXERCISE BETTER CAFFEINE HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE SUPPLEMENTS EVER FOR IMPROVING EXERCISE OUTPUT
YOU1000000177_S0000012	DRINKING COFFEE CAUSES A SPIKE IN ADRENALINE AND CAUSES AN INCREASE IN EXERCISE PERFORMANCE BY AROUND ELEVEN TO TWELVE PERCENT NUMBER THREE YOUR HEART SEEMS TO LIKE IT
YOU1000000177_S0000013	DRINKING UP TO TWO COFFEE CUPS PER DAY CAN REDUCE THE RISK OF HEART FAILURE BY UP TO ELEVEN PERCENT NUMBER FOUR COFFEE CAN MAKE YOU SMARTER

YOU1000000179_S0000005	GIVING IS MOST FULFILLING WHEN YOU DONATE YOUR MONEY OR TIME TO A CAUSE YOU'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT
YOU1000000179_S0000006	AND STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT WHEN WE GIVE IT TRIGGERS THE SAME CHEMICAL REACTIONS IN OUR BRAINS AS FALLING IN LOVE OR BONDING WITH A NEW BORN CHILD

YOU1000000179_S0000016	MAKE SURE TO EVALUATE THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT SHARE YOUR CAUSE TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE STRONG LEADERSHIP PROCEDURES THAT WILL GUIDE THEIR OPERATIONS AND WILL BENEFIT FROM YOUR ASSISTANCE
YOU1000000179_S0000018	GIVING CAN BE MORE FUN AND MORE EFFECTIVE BY CONNECTING WITH OTHERS WHO SHARE YOUR GOALS

YOU1000000181_S0000061	OKAY THAT'S IT GUYS THANKS FOR WATCHING
YOU1000000183_S0000000	ONE THING YOU'RE TRYING TO DO ALL THESE PUBLIC COMPANIES OUT THERE HERE'S THE COMPANY I REALLY LIKE THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE TERRIFIC THEIR EARNINGS ARE DOING WELL THEIR COMPETITORS ARE DOING POORLY
YOU1000000183_S0000001	I THINK THIS COMPANY IS DOING TERRIFIC AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE STOCK MIGHT HAVE GONE FROM FORTY TO THIRTY BECAUSE OF THIS DECLINE THAT WOULD SAY WOW HERE'S A CHANCE TO BUY IT
YOU1000000183_S0000002	YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY SOME COMPANIES MIGHT HAVE BEEN OVERPRICED AT SIXTY ALL THEY DID WAS GO TO FIFTY SAY BIG DEAL SO YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND ONE YOU LIKE ANYWAY RIGHT NOW YOU LIKED THEM AND NOW THEY'VE HAD A HAIRCUT
YOU1000000183_S0000003	THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD DO NOT NOT A SECTION FROM OVERPRICED TO FAIRLY PRICE THAT WAS FAIRLY PLACE AT THE START OF THIS EXERCISE AND THEN HAD A VERY YOU KNOW FIVE FOR FOR SALE
YOU1000000183_S0000005	HEY GUYS WELCOME BACK TO THE CHANNEL IN THIS VIDEO WE ARE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT SOME INVESTING LESSONS THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM PETER LYNCH
YOU1000000183_S0000006	THAT WE CAN APPLY FOR OUR OWN INVESTING IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY ONE
YOU1000000183_S0000007	SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOOK AT AN INTERVIEW FROM WAY BACK NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN CHARLIE ROSE INTERVIEW THAT PETER LYNCH DID AND I DO HAVE TO SAY APOLOGIES
YOU1000000183_S0000008	SOME OF THE CUTS IN THIS INTERVIEW ARE GOING TO BE QUITE ABRUPT IT'S BECAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND LIKE CHARLIE ROSE HE JUST INTERRUPTS PETER ALL THE TIME IN THIS INTERVIEW
YOU1000000183_S0000009	SO I APOLOGIZE I'VE TRIED TO DO THE BEST I CAN TO GET TO THE MEAT OF THE ARGUMENT BECAUSE I THINK THE WHOLE INTERVIEW IS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MINUTES SO I'VE TRIED TO CHOP IT DOWN INTO THE BEST BITS
YOU1000000183_S0000010	SO WITH THAT SAID LET'S GET STUCK INTO IT
YOU1000000183_S0000011	GLAD TO BE
YOU1000000183_S0000012	EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT'S GOING ON
YOU1000000183_S0000013	WELL WE HAD A HUGE RUN I MEAN THE MARKET WAS FOUR THOUSAND JUST YOU KNOW TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO YEAH AND IT RAN UP TO EIGHTY THREE HUNDRED IN AUGUST
YOU1000000183_S0000014	AND YOU KNOW LIKE ANY BIG RALLY SOMETIMES IT BACKS OFF I MEAN IT'S HEALTHY
YOU1000000183_S0000015	EVERYTHING IS OVERPRICED
YOU1000000183_S0000016	YEAH AND THAT DOESN'T HELP ANYTHING THE MARKET SINCE WORLD WAR TWO IS SOLD BETWEEN TEN TIMES EARNINGS AND TWENTY TIMES EARNINGS IF YOU LOOK AT THE DOW JONES ON THE POND YOU ADD UP ALL THE COMPANIES AND TAKE THE EARNINGS
YOU1000000183_S0000017	SAY THERE'S A RELATIONSHIP AND IT FOLLOWS MCDONALD'S EARNINGS HAVE BEEN TERRIFIC THE LAST THIRTY YEARS AND THE STOCK'S BEEN TERRIFIC THERE'S A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP SO THE EARNINGS OF THE S AND P FIVE HUNDRED HAVE BEEN BETWEEN THIS RANGE OF TEN AND TWENTY
YOU1000000183_S0000018	WE WERE JUST ABOUT TO GO OVER THE TWENTY WHICH IS THE HIGH END OF THE RANGE THERE WASN'T A
YOU1000000183_S0000019	TWENTY TWO IS AT THE TOP OF A HIGH IT SHOULD EVER BE
YOU1000000183_S0000020	RIGHT IT'S BEEN OVER THERE ONLY A FEW TIMES EVER OVER TWENTY AND THAT'S WHEN USUALLY INFLATION IS ABOUT ZERO
YOU1000000183_S0000021	THIS CLIP KIND OF JUST SETS THE SCENE BECAUSE WHAT PETER LYNCH IS DESCRIBING IN THIS CLIP IS ACTUALLY WHAT WE SEE TODAY HE'S TALKING ABOUT HOW THE RATIO OF THE MARKET
YOU1000000183_S0000022	GENERALLY SITS BETWEEN TEN AND TWENTY WITH TWENTY REALLY BEING THAT UPPER END WELL NOW THESE DAYS WE HAVE DISCOVERED WHAT THE ULTRA UPPER END OF THAT NUMBER LOOKS LIKE
YOU1000000183_S0000023	IT SEEMS TO BE
YOU1000000183_S0000025	ABOUT THIRTY NOW THAT'S KIND OF SCARY BECAUSE WHAT WE CURRENTLY SEE IS A P E RATIO FOR THE MARKET AT THIRTY FIVE
YOU1000000183_S0000026	IT'S ONLY BEEN OVER THIRTY IN THREE TIMES IN HISTORY NINETEEN TWENTY NINE NINETEEN NINETY NINE AND RIGHT NOW
YOU1000000183_S0000027	THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE MARKET IS CERTAINLY HOT JUST LIKE THE MARKET WAS HOT BACK WHEN PETER LYNCH DID THIS INTERVIEW
YOU1000000183_S0000028	BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN BUT THE QUESTION WE'VE GOT TO ASK OURSELVES IS WELL HOW DO WE GO ABOUT OUR INVESTING IN THIS ENVIRONMENT
YOU1000000183_S0000029	THE DECLINE YESTERDAY IN A SENSE HAD LET OFF SOME OF THIS OVERVALUATION THE MARKET WAS EVEN OVERVALUED WHERE IT WAS AND BY LETTING IT OFF THEN WE GOT BACK TO WHAT WAS REASONABLE
YOU1000000183_S0000030	YEAH I WOULD SAY FAIRLY PRICED MAYBE FOR THE LARGER COMPANIES THEY'RE NOW OKAY THERE MIGHT BE SOME SMALLER COMPANIES WE'VE HAD THREE THOUSAND COMPANIES COME PUBLIC THE LAST FOUR YEARS THAT'S TWO BUSINESS DAY
YOU1000000183_S0000031	SOME OF THOSE COMPANIES HAVE GONE DOWN DRAMATICALLY AND THAT'S SORT OF RESEARCH ZONE THAT AVERAGE PEOPLE IN THE STOCK SHOP THAT WE CAN FIND SOME PEOPLE KNOW A LOT ABOUT THIS TEN THOUSAND PUBLIC COMPANIES
YOU1000000183_S0000032	A LOT OF THEM ARE VERY ATTRACTIVE NO ONE'S FOLLOWING THERE'S LOTS OF PEOPLE
YOU1000000183_S0000034	COMPANIES THAT NOBODY ELSE FOLLOWED
YOU1000000183_S0000035	I'D LIKE TO GO TO SEE COMPANIES WITH UNIONS OR COMPANIES IN TROUBLE OR COMPANIES THAT NO ONE LOOKS AT
YOU1000000183_S0000036	HAD NICE BEDS
YOU1000000183_S0000037	YOU HAVE TO
YOU1000000183_S0000038	YOUR WIFE HAS THE STORY
YOU1000000183_S0000039	YOU GOT PIRONE IMPORTS MY WIFE FOUND THAT ONE TOO BUT BUT YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT TWENTY TO FIND ONE IT'S JUST YOU GO TO THE MALL AND FIND THE STOCK I MEAN YOU HAVE TO SAY MY GOD THIS SOUNDS LIKE IT'S GOOD THEN YOU HAVE TO DO SOME STEPS YOU HAVE TO DO AN ORGANIZED METHOD
YOU1000000183_S0000040	NOW THAT METHOD WE'LL GET TO IN A SECOND BUT IN THIS CLIP PETER INADVERTENTLY DESCRIBES EXACTLY HOW WE SHOULD BE APPROACHING OUR INVESTING RIGHT NOW
YOU1000000183_S0000041	BECAUSE TODAY EVEN THOUGH THE MARKET IS REALLY HIGH WE'RE IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE ACTUALLY A LOT OF BUSINESSES ARE GOING DOWN
YOU1000000183_S0000042	WHAT WE SEE IS THAT AN INDEX LIKE THE S AND P FIVE HUNDRED IS ACTUALLY PROPPED UP
YOU1000000183_S0000043	BY LITERALLY FIVE TO TEN REALLY HIGH PERFORMING MASSIVE BEHEMOTH COMPANIES
YOU1000000183_S0000044	NOW WHAT PETER'S TELLING US IN THIS CLIP IS TO BE A GREAT INVESTOR EVEN WHEN THE MARKET'S REALLY OVERVALUED YOU HAVE TO GET AWAY FROM LOOKING AT JUST THOSE MASSIVE BEHEMOTH COMPANIES
YOU1000000183_S0000045	EVERYBODY'S FOLLOWING THESE BIG COMPANIES EVERYONE'S INVESTING IN THEM AND THE PRICES FOR THESE BIG COMPANIES ARE ALL SKY HIGH
YOU1000000183_S0000046	SO WE SHOULD BE BROADENING OUR HORIZONS AND LOOKING MAYBE AT THE COMPANIES THAT COME AFTER THE FIFTIETH LARGEST STOCK IN THE S AND P FIVE HUNDRED
YOU1000000183_S0000047	MAYBE BEYOND THE TWENTIETH LARGEST STOCK IN THE ASX TWO HUNDRED BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE MORE LIKELY GOING TO FIND VALUE
YOU1000000183_S0000048	AND THEN THE OTHER SECRET IS THAT OF COURSE YOU JUST HAVE TO KEEP LOOKING AT A LOT OF BUSINESSES
YOU1000000183_S0000049	THE BEST INVESTORS ARE THE ONES THAT TURN OVER THE MOST STONES RIGHT AS PETER LYNCH SAID IN THIS INTERVIEW YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT TWENTY TO FIND ONE
YOU1000000183_S0000050	WITH THAT SAID NOW LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE ACTUAL STEPS THAT WE SHOULD ALL BE TAKING TO GO AHEAD AND MAKE AN INVESTMENT IN THIS SORT OF ENVIRONMENT
YOU1000000183_S0000051	THEN YOU HAVE TO DO SOME STEPS YOU HAVE TO DO AN ORGANIZED METHOD PEOPLE ARE CAREFUL WHEN THEY BUY A TOASTER
YOU1000000183_S0000053	CARE FOR THE CAREFUL THEY THEY DO THEY DO SOME RESEARCH
YOU1000000183_S0000054	BUT THEY DON'T DO IT WITH STOCK THEY CALL THE BROKER OR THEY SEE SOMEBODY AT LUNCH AND THEY SAID MAN I GOT THIS HOT STOCK AND YOU RUN RIGHT OUT AND YOU SPEND FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS SMALL INVESTORS
YOU1000000183_S0000055	THE MORE THEY PUT AN OPTION IN INTERNATIONAL DATA WHICH THEY DON'T EVEN OWN INTERNATIONAL DATA WAS THE NINETY DAY
YOU1000000183_S0000056	I SAID IT WAS GOOD AND THEY MAKE A LOT OF MONEY
YOU1000000183_S0000057	AND IT'S LIKE A CASINO YEAH SO IT'S LIKE A CASINO YOU GET THE SAME RESULTS AS IF THERE'S MORE PAPERWORK
YOU1000000183_S0000058	SO THIS MORNING YOU GET UP AND YOU GO IN AND YOU LOOK AT AT THOSE COMPANIES THAT FIT
YOU1000000183_S0000059	THAT YOU KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN ITCH I MEAN LET'S SAY CEMENT INDUSTRY GOES FROM CRUMMY TO SEMI CRUMMY TO FAIRLY GOOD THE STOCKS ARE GOING NORTH
YOU1000000183_S0000060	YOU'RE GONNA MAKE MONEY THAT'S THE INDUSTRY YOU KNOW WHAT IF YOU KNOW THE PUBLISHING INDUSTRY YOU YOU SOME PEOPLE HAVE YOU HAVE AN EDGE YOU WORK I MEAN WHAT IF YOU LAST THIRTY YEARS
YOU1000000183_S0000061	YOU WORK IN THE RESTAURANT YOU WOULD'VE SEEN TACO BELL YOU HAVE SEEN SOME BAROS YOU HAVE SEEN PIZZA HUT YOU HAVE SEEN CHILIS YOU SEE THESE COMPANIES DOING VERY WELL YOU SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT THOSE INSTEAD OF TRYING TO BUY BIOTECHNOLOGY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT
YOU1000000183_S0000062	I MEAN I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT LOCAL AREA NETWORKING LOT OF PEOPLE ARE BUYING THE CISCO THEY'RE BUYING THE EQUIPMENT SAYING WE'RE GONNA ROOT TOGETHER ALL THESE PERIPHERALS GONNA PUT TOGETHER THE SERVER
YOU1000000183_S0000063	BUT BUT THAT'S NOT A BAD BUT BECAUSE THEY OWN A HUGE PERCENTAGE OF THEIR MARKET
YOU1000000183_S0000064	THAT WAS THEY'RE SAYING ONLY A FEW PEOPLE HAD THE GOD IF IT WORKS FOR US OTHER PEOPLE TRY IT THEN COLLEGES WILL TRY HIGH SCHOOL WILL TRY THE OVERSEAS THEY KNEW THEY WERE EARLY IN THE BALL GAME RIGHT
YOU1000000183_S0000065	AND THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN BUYING THAT COMPANY INSTEAD OF OUT BUYING SOMETHING HE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT SOME OIL DRILLING COMPANY I MEAN PEOPLE HAVE THIS TENDENCY TO ALWAYS BUY SOMETHING THEY DON'T
YOU1000000183_S0000066	ALL YOU NEED IS CALLED ALL YOU NEED IS A FEW GOOD STOCKS
YOU1000000183_S0000067	IS YOUR SONG THIS HAS BEEN YOUR SONG FOR A LONG TIME ONLY BY WHAT YOU KNOW
YOU1000000183_S0000068	BUT PEOPLE WAKE UP THE MORN THEY SAY THERE'S FIVE THOUSAND COMPANIES OUT THERE WHICH ONE SHOULD I BUY THE AVERAGE PERSON OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW FOUR OR FIVE COMPANIES THEY TO BE TO LECTURE ON THEM THEY UNDERSTAND THE COMPANIES
YOU1000000183_S0000069	AND THIS FORCES YOU THIS TOOL SAYS TO YOU RIGHT DOWN
YOU1000000183_S0000070	YOU KEEP SAYING THIS
YOU1000000183_S0000071	THAT MAKES SENSE YOU HAVE TO START WITH OBVIOUSLY GOING AHEAD AND DOING SOME RESEARCH YOU KNOW HE SAYS PEOPLE DO A LOT OF RESEARCH WHEN THEY GO TO BUY A TOASTER
YOU1000000183_S0000072	WHY ISN'T IT THAT PEOPLE DO A LOT OF RESEARCH WHEN THEY GO TO BUY A STOCK YOU KNOW DON'T TREAT THE STOCK MARKET LIKE A CASINO
YOU1000000183_S0000073	THEN WHEN YOU ACTUALLY DO SIT DOWN TO LEARN ABOUT SOME COMPANIES LOOK AT THE COMPANIES THAT ARE REALLY RELEVANT TO YOU
YOU1000000183_S0000074	WARREN BUFFETT WOULD USE THE PHRASE STICK WITHIN YOUR CIRCLE OF COMPETENCE PETER LYNCH'S EXAMPLE HERE IS YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE SOMEONE THAT WORKS IN THE RESTAURANT RESTAURANT INDUSTRY
YOU1000000183_S0000075	LOOK AT PIZZA HUT LOOK AT TACO BELL THEY ARE COMPANIES THAT YOU PROBABLY ALREADY UNDERSTAND TO QUITE A HIGH LEVEL
YOU1000000183_S0000076	AND DON'T GO MESSING AROUND WITH YOU KNOW THESE BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES THAT NOBODY UNDERSTANDS SO ONCE YOU FIND THOSE COMPANIES THAT RESONATE WITH YOU THEN YOU GO IN YOU DO THAT RESEARCH
YOU1000000183_S0000077	AS PETER LYNCH SAYS YOU ONLY NEED FOUR TO FIVE GOOD STOCKS IN LIKE A DECADE WARREN BUFFET WOULD ARGUE YOU NEED EVEN LESS THAN THAT
YOU1000000183_S0000078	BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW THOSE COMPANIES WELL ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO GIVE A LECTURE ON THEIR BUSINESS
YOU1000000183_S0000079	SO THAT'S REALLY THE FIRST STEP FIRST STEP IS TO STAY WITHIN YOUR KIND OF CIRCLE OF COMPETENCE SECOND STEP GO IN AND UNDERSTAND THOSE BUSINESSES IN DEPTH
YOU1000000183_S0000080	AND THEN AFTER THAT WHAT HAPPENS NEXT WELL LET'S LISTEN IN
YOU1000000183_S0000081	ONE THING YOU'RE TRYING TO DO ALL THESE PUBLIC COMPANIES OUT THERE HERE'S THE COMPANY I REALLY LIKE THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE TERRIFIC THEIR EARNINGS ARE DOING WELL THEIR COMPETITORS ARE DOING POORLY
YOU1000000183_S0000082	I THINK THIS COMPANY IS DOING TERRIFIC AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE STOCK MIGHT HAVE GONE FROM FORTY TO THIRTY BECAUSE OF THIS DECLINE THAT WOULD SAY WOW HERE'S A CHANCE TO BUY IT
YOU1000000183_S0000083	YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY SOME COMPANIES MIGHT HAVE BEEN OVERPRICED AT SIXTY AND ALL THEY DID WAS GO TO FIFTY SAY BIG DEAL SO YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND ONE YOU LIKE ANYWAY
YOU1000000183_S0000084	RIGHT NOW YOU LIKE THEM AND NOW THEY'VE HAD A HAIRCUT THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD DO YOU NOT NOT SELECTED ONE FROM OVERPRICED TO FAIRLY PLACE SOMETHING FAIRLY PLACED AT THE START OF THIS EXERCISE
YOU1000000183_S0000085	AND THEN HAD A VERY YOU KNOW FIVE FOR FOR SALE
YOU1000000183_S0000086	IF YOU HAD BEEN MANAGING THE MAGELLAN FUND THIS MORNING YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN BUYING LIKE CRAZY
YOU1000000183_S0000087	I WOULD BEEN RESEARCHING LIKE CRAZY I WOULD BE SAYING WHICH COMPANIES ARE THE SAME STORY IS THERE ANYTHING REALLY HAPPENED THIS IS A NON EVENT FOR THEM THEY'RE STILL DOING WELL EVEN IF WE HAVE A RECESSION
YOU1000000183_S0000088	NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM AND THAT'S THE KIND OF KID TRYING TO BUY BUT LET'S SAY IF COM JUST THINK OF THIS AS BEING YOU SAY TO YOURSELF I THINK THIS ONE'S GONNA EARN SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE
YOU1000000183_S0000089	IF IT'S ALREADY DISCOUNTING THAT IF IT'S SELLING AT A HUGE MULTIPLE YOU SAY IT'S ALREADY IT HAS TO WORK AND THEN IT'S GOING TO STAY EVEN
YOU1000000183_S0000090	SO YOU HAVE TO SAY STUFF IF I'M RIGHT HOW MUCH AM I GOING TO MAKE IF I'M WRONG HOW MUCH AM I GOING TO LOSE THAT'S THE RISK REWARD RATIO IN STOCK SO WE TALK ABOUT IF I'M RIGHT I HOPE I'M GOING TO DOUBLE TRIP MY MONEY IF I'M WRONG
YOU1000000183_S0000091	MAY LOSE THIRTY FORTY PERCENT THAT'S A FAVOR RATIO YOU SAY IF I'M RIGHT THE STOCK IS NOT GOING UP IT'S ALREADY DISCOUNTING TERRIFIC THINGS IF DISCOUNTING TERRIFIC THINGS ARE ALREADY IN THE STOCK I DON'T
YOU1000000183_S0000092	SO FIRST STEP IS TO FIND A COMPANY WHERE YOU'VE GOT THE EDGE THE SECOND STEP IS TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE BUSINESS UNDERSTAND THE FINANCIALS UNDERSTAND THE FUNDAMENTALS
YOU1000000183_S0000093	BUT THEN WHAT PETER LYNCH TALKS ABOUT IN THIS ENVIRONMENT WHERE BASICALLY EVERYTHING IS OVERVALUED WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO TRY AND FIND COMPANIES THAT ARE JUST FAIRLY VALUED
YOU1000000183_S0000094	EVEN IN THIS EXTREME OVERVALUED ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE AS INVESTORS WHAT WE DO IS WE BUY UNDERVALUED STOCKS RIGHT WE ALWAYS BUY AT A DISCOUNT TO INTRINSIC VALUE
YOU1000000183_S0000095	THAT'S HOW WE KNOW WE MAKE MONEY IN THE LONG RUN NOW IF YOU FIND A COMPANY THAT'S REALLY GREAT BUT IT'S ALSO REALLY EXPENSIVE IN THIS ENVIRONMENT
YOU1000000183_S0000096	AND THEN THERE'S SOME SORT OF YOU KNOW TEN FIFTEEN PERCENT MARKET DIP AND IT BRINGS THE STOCK BACK DOWN TO FAIR VALUE WELL THEN REMEMBER YOU'RE STILL IT'S STILL LIKE PAYING
YOU1000000183_S0000097	FULL RETAIL FOR THAT STOCK SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS GREAT BUSINESSES THAT IN THIS OVERVALUED ENVIRONMENT ARE JUST FAIRLY VALUE
YOU1000000183_S0000098	IF ANYTHING DOES HAPPEN SUDDENLY IN THE MARKET SOMETHING CAUSES A TEN PERCENT DIP OR FIFTEEN PERCENT DIP THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT BUSINESS GOES FROM BEING FAIR VALUE
YOU1000000183_S0000099	TO NOW BEING UNDERVALUED SO THEY'RE THE KIND OF SITUATIONS WE'RE LOOKING FOR IMAGINE THIS THE NEW XBOX ONE CONSOLE FULL RETAIL
YOU1000000183_S0000100	PRICE I THINK IS SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS IF YOU WENT INTO SAY
YOU1000000183_S0000102	GAMES AND THEY WERE SELLING THAT XBOX FOR YOU KNOW THAT IT WAS A THOUSAND DOLLARS AND NOW IT'S DROPPED DOWN TO SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
YOU1000000183_S0000103	YOU'RE NOT GETTING EXCITED BY THAT DEAL BECAUSE IT'S JUST COME BACK DOWN TO FULL PRICE BUT IF THAT SAME STORE WAS OFFERING YOU KNOW IT STARTED AT SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY FULL RE
YOU1000000183_S0000104	AND THEN IT DROPPED DOWN TO FIVE HUNDRED WELL OBVIOUSLY THAT'S A MUCH BETTER DEAL EXACTLY THE SAME THING WITH BUSINESSES IN THE STOCK MARKET
YOU1000000183_S0000105	AND JUST QUICKLY THE OTHER THING TO NOTE FROM WHAT PETER LYNCH SAID IN THIS LITTLE CLIP WAS WHEN HE SAID IF A STOCK IS TRADING AT A HUGE MULTIPLE IT BASICALLY HAS TO WORK
YOU1000000183_S0000106	RIGHT AND IF IT DOES WORK OUT THEN YOU'RE STILL JUST EVEN NOW EVEN TODAY WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS SOME COMPANIES THEY MIGHT BE GREAT COMPANIES BUT THEY'RE TRADING AT RATIOS IN THE HUNDREDS
YOU1000000183_S0000107	IF NOT LITERALLY THE THOUSANDS LIKE SOME COMPANIES FOR INSTANCE LIKE TESLA I THINK HAS A RATIO OF ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED
YOU1000000183_S0000108	NOW WHAT THIS MEANS IS IT MEANS THAT THE PRICE THAT INVESTORS ARE PAYING TODAY THIS IS ALREADY THEY ARE EXPECTING FLAWLESS CONTINUED GROWTH
YOU1000000183_S0000109	FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS TO COME THAT'S WHAT THE SHARE PRICE IS TELLING US NOW IF YOU INVEST IN A COMPANY LIKE THIS AT THESE PRICES
YOU1000000183_S0000110	THEN THERE'S VERY LITTLE ROOM FOR UPSIDE AND THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF ROOM FOR DOWNSIDE BECAUSE INVESTORS RIGHT NOW ARE ALREADY EXPECTING YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS OF PERFECTION
YOU1000000183_S0000111	RIGHT OF ABSOLUTELY PERFECT EXECUTION AS PETER LYNCH SAYS YOU HAVE TO FACTOR IN IF I'M RIGHT HOW MUCH AM I GOING TO MAKE
YOU1000000183_S0000112	AND IF I'M WRONG HOW MUCH AM I GOING TO LOSE AND THAT'S A VERY THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT COUPLE OF QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELF BEFORE BUYING INTO A STOCK
YOU1000000183_S0000113	AND THAT'S WHERE YOU GO BACK TO YOUR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS AND YOU LOOK AT THE GROWTH RATES TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT RISK RATIO IS FOR THE COMPANY THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT
YOU1000000183_S0000114	WHAT YOU'RE SAYING TO PEOPLE TODAY ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE MARKET OVER THE NEAR TERM IS WHAT WHAT'S YOUR FEE
YOU1000000183_S0000115	WE CAN BUY BUSES CAN TAKE A COIN OUT AND FLIP IT I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE NEXT THOUSAND POINTS GONNA DO
YOU1000000183_S0000116	THE NEXT SIX THOUSAND POINTS CAN BE UP THE NEXT FOURTEEN THOUSAND POINTS CAN BE UP THE NEXT TWENTY THOUSAND POINTS CAN BE
YOU1000000183_S0000117	BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE NEXT THOUSAND IS GOING
YOU1000000183_S0000118	NOBODY NOBODY DOES
YOU1000000183_S0000119	AND IT'S FUTILE TO TRY AND GUESS IT CORPORATE PROFITS WILL BE A LOT HIGHER TEN YEARS FROM NOW IT'LL BE A LOT HIGHER TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW THAT'S WHAT YOU COULD RELY ON
YOU1000000183_S0000120	THE THIRD KEY STEP THAT PETER LYNCH HIGHLIGHTS IN THIS CLIP IS TO ALWAYS FOCUS ON THE LONG TERM
YOU1000000183_S0000121	DON'T BE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THE MARKET WILL DO NEXT WEEK NEXT MONTH OR EVEN NEXT YEAR WHAT YOU SHOULD BE REALLY FOCUSED ON IS WHAT IS THIS COMPANY GOING TO LOOK LIKE IN FIVE YEARS FROM NOW
YOU1000000183_S0000122	IN TEN YEARS FROM NOW ALWAYS FOCUS ON THE LONG TERM BECAUSE IF YOU CAN DO THAT THEN SHORT TERM MARKET FLUCTUATIONS THEY REALLY DON'T MATTER
YOU1000000183_S0000123	AND YOU JUST DON'T STRESS ABOUT THEM AT ALL IN FACT WHEN PRICES GO DOWN YOU GET EXCITED YOU DON'T GET SCARED
YOU1000000183_S0000124	AS PETER LYNCH SAYS YOU KNOW CORPORATE PROFITS WILL BE A LOT HIGHER IN TEN YEARS FROM NOW THEY'LL BE A LOT HIGHER IN TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW AND THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO RELY ON SO
YOU1000000183_S0000125	WE RELY ON THE FACT THAT YES BUSINESSES ARE GOING TO CONTINUALLY IMPROVE NOT MAYBE NOT OVER THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING LIKE WHAT WE SAW WITH THE LOCKDOWN WHERE BUSINESS IS IMPAIRED FOR LIKE A WHOLE YEAR OR TWO
YOU1000000183_S0000126	IT STILL DOESN'T MATTER TO US BECAUSE WE LOOK FOR SITUATIONS WHERE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN OVER FIVE YEARS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN OVER TEN YEARS
YOU1000000183_S0000127	AND IF THAT SITUATION IS FAVOURABLE THAT'S WHEN WE INVEST
YOU1000000183_S0000128	WHAT ABOUT ALL THE CRITICISM OF DERIVATIVES AND THE IMPACT THEY HAVE HAD
YOU1000000183_S0000129	THAT'S A LITTLE COMPLICATED FOR ME
YOU1000000183_S0000130	ALL I KNOW IS I MEAN I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU IT'S WAY OVER MY HEAD I'VE NEVER BOUGHT AN OPTION IN MY LIFE I NEVER TIMES ON YOUR SIDE WHEN YOU OWN A STOCK YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW ABOUT PUTTING YOU KNOW THREE PERCENT DOWN AND BUYING A FUTURE AND A STRAP AND STRADDLE THAT'S WAY OVER MY HEAD
YOU1000000183_S0000132	RIGHT SO YOU'RE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY EARNING POTENTIAL FOR MOST WELL RUN COMPANIES WILL DO ALL RIGHT
YOU1000000183_S0000133	BUT PEOPLE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WE'VE HAD NINE RECESSION SINCE WORLD WAR TWO
YOU1000000183_S0000134	WE'LL HAVE OTHER RECESSIONS
YOU1000000183_S0000135	IN ONE

YOU1000000184_S0000001	BOB KLEIN FROM LOS ANGELES I WONDER IF YOU COULD GIVE US A GLIMPSE INTO YOUR INVESTMENT PROCESS THE WAY YOU APPROACH LOOKING AT A PARTICULAR INDUSTRY AND I WONDER IF YOU COULD USE REAL ESTATE AS AN EXAMPLE
YOU1000000184_S0000002	I KNOW REAL ESTATE HASN'T BEEN A BIG HUGE PART OF BERKSHIRES PORTFOLIO OVER THE YEARS AND I WONDER IF THAT'S BECAUSE YOU VIEW REAL ESTATE AS A COMMODITY BUSINESS
YOU1000000184_S0000003	OR MAYBE THE CASH FLOWS FROM REAL ESTATE TEND TO BE MORE PREDICTABLE THAN PERHAPS FROM SOME OTHER INDUSTRIES
YOU1000000184_S0000005	IT TENDS TO BE LESS LIKELY TO BE MISPRICED AND AND THEREFORE LESS LIKELY TO FIND TERRIFIC BARGAINS IN REAL ESTATE
YOU1000000184_S0000006	
YOU1000000184_S0000007	GO AHEAD
YOU1000000184_S0000008	SO JUST WONDERING IF WE COULD IF WE WERE WATCHING A DISCUSSION BETWEEN YOU AND CHARLIE HASHING OUT THE MERITS OF REAL ESTATE HOW HOW IT WOULD GO
YOU1000000184_S0000009	WELL IT WOULD GO LIKE ALL OUR OTHER CONVERSATIONS HE WOULD SAY NO FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES
YOU1000000184_S0000011	AND I WOULD GAUGE BY THE BY THE DEGREE TO WHICH HE EMOTION HE PUT INTO HIS NOTES WHETHER HE REALLY LIKED THE DEAL OR NOT
YOU1000000184_S0000013	YEAH
YOU1000000184_S0000015	WE BOTH HAD A FAIR AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCE IN REAL ESTATE AND CHARLIE MADE EARLY MONEY IN REAL ESTATE
YOU1000000184_S0000016	THE SECOND POINT IS THE MORE IMPORTANT POINT IS NOT REAL ESTATE IS NOT A COMMODITY BUT
YOU1000000184_S0000018	I THINK IT TENDS TO BE MORE ACCURATELY PRICED
YOU1000000184_S0000019	PARTICULARLY DEVELOPED REAL ESTATE MORE ACCURATELY PRICED MOST OF THE TIME
YOU1000000184_S0000020	DURING THE PERIOD WHEN YOU HAD HUGE AMOUNTS OF TRANSACTIONS AND YOU HAD YOU HAD AN OWNER THAT DIDN'T WANT TO BE AN OWNER IN A VERY BIG WAY AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL THEY OWNED AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING
YOU1000000184_S0000021	I MEAN YOU HAD A LOT OF MISPRICING THEN AND I KNOW A FEW PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM THAT MADE A LOT OF MONEY OFF OF THAT BUT
YOU1000000184_S0000023	UNDER
YOU1000000184_S0000025	MOST CONDITIONS IT'S IT'S HARD TO FIND REAL ESTATE THAT'S REALLY MISPRICED I MEAN WHEN I LOOK AT WHEN I LOOK AT THE TRANSACTIONS THAT READS ENGAGE IN CURRENTLY AND YOU GET A LOT OF INFORMATION ON THAT SORT OF THING
YOU1000000184_S0000026	YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE VERY SIMILAR
YOU1000000184_S0000028	BUT IT'S A COMPETITIVE WORLD AND
YOU1000000184_S0000029	AND YOU KNOW THEY ALL KNOW ABOUT WHAT A CLASSIC OFFICE BUILDING IN YOU KNOW IN CHICAGO OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE IS GOING TO PRODUCE AT LEAST THEY HAVE THEY MAY ALL BE WRONG AS IT TURNS OUT BECAUSE OF SOME UNUSUAL EVENTS BUT
YOU1000000184_S0000030	BUT IT'S HARD TO ARGUE WITH THE CURRENT CONVENTIONAL WISDOM MOST OF THE TIME IN THE REAL ESTATE WORLD
YOU1000000184_S0000031	BUT OCCASIONALLY THERE THERE'VE BEEN SOME YOU KNOW THERE THERE COULD BE BIG OPPORTUNITIES IN THE FIELD BUT IF THEY EXIST
YOU1000000184_S0000033	IT WILL CERTAINLY BE BECAUSE THERE'S PROBABLY THERE'LL BE A LOT OF CHAOS IN REAL ESTATE FINANCING FOR ONE REASON OR OTHER WE'VE DONE SOME REAL ESTATE FINANCING AND
YOU1000000184_S0000035	YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE MONEY SHUT OFF
YOU1000000184_S0000037	QUITE A DEGREE PROBABLY TO GET ANY BIG MISPRICING ACROSS THE BOARD CHARLIE
YOU1000000184_S0000039	WE DON'T HAVE
YOU1000000184_S0000041	COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OVER EXPERIENCED REAL ESTATE INVESTORS IN THE FIELD
YOU1000000184_S0000043	WE WOULDN'T HAVE IF WE WERE OPERATING WITH OUR OWN MONEY AS A PARTNERSHIP
YOU1000000184_S0000045	IF YOU OPERATE AS A CORPORATION SUCH AS OURS WHICH IS TAXABLE UNDER
YOU1000000184_S0000047	CHAPTER OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE YOU'VE GOT A WHOLE LAYER OF CORPORATE TAXES
YOU1000000184_S0000048	BETWEEN THE REAL ESTATE INCOME AND THE USE OF THE INCOME BY THE PEOPLE WHO OWN THE REAL ESTATE SO
YOU1000000184_S0000050	BY ITS NATURE REAL ESTATE TENDS TO BE A VERY LOUSY INVESTMENT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE TAXED UNDER SUBCHAPTER C OF THE CODE RELATING TO CORPORATIONS SO THE COMBINATION OF HAVING
YOU1000000184_S0000052	GENERALLY ALLOWS THE ACTIVITY FOR PEOPLE WITH OUR TAX STRUCTURE AND HAVING NO SPECIAL COMPETENCE IN THE FIELD
YOU1000000184_S0000053	MEANS THAT WE SPEND ALMOST NO TIME THINKING ABOUT ANYTHING IN REAL ESTATE AND THEN SUCH REAL ESTATE AS WE'VE ACTUALLY
YOU1000000184_S0000055	DONE LIKE HOLDING SIR
YOU1000000184_S0000057	I'D SAY WE HAVE A POOR RECORD
YOU1000000184_S0000059	SCORPS REALLY DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE I MEAN I KNOW THERE ARE CORPS AROUND THAT THAT ARE IN REAL ESTATE BUT THERE ARE OTHER STRUCTURES THAT ARE MORE ATTRACTIVE THERE REALLY AREN'T OTHER STRUCTURES
YOU1000000184_S0000060	I MEAN LLOYD IS AN ATTEMPT AT IT TO SOME DEGREE BUT THERE AREN'T OTHER STRUCTURES THAT WORK WELL FOR BIG INSURANCE COMPANIES I MEAN YOU CAN'T HAVE A WALMART VERY WELL THAT DOES NOT EXIST IN A SECURE
YOU1000000184_S0000061	THEY ARE NOT SUBJECT TO SCORE OR PARTNERSHIP COMPETITION THAT DETERMINES THE RETURNS ON CAPITAL IN THE DISCOUNT OUR FIELD
YOU1000000184_S0000062	BUT IF YOU'RE COMPETING WITH EQUIVALENT OF CORPS
YOU1000000184_S0000064	OR PARTNERSHIPS OR INDIVIDUALS
YOU1000000184_S0000065	YOU'VE JUST GOT AN ECONOMIC DISADVANTAGE AS A C CORP WHICH IS FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T LOVE READING THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE
YOU1000000184_S0000067	CORPORATION THAT YOU THINK OF ALL THE DOW JONES COMPANIES ALL OF THE S AND P COMPANIES AND SO ON
YOU1000000184_S0000069	AND THE
YOU1000000184_S0000071	CHARLIE SAYS IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THAT THE DISADVANTAGE OF OUR STRUCTURE COMBINED WITH THE COMPETITIVE NATURE OF PEOPLE WITH BETTER STRUCTURES BUYING THOSE KINDS OF ASSETS WILL EVER LEAD TO ANYTHING
YOU1000000184_S0000072	REALLY INTERESTING ALTHOUGH I WOULD SAY THAT WE MISSED THE BOAT TO SOME EXTENT DURING THE RTC DAYS I MEAN
YOU1000000184_S0000074	IT WAS A SUFFICIENTLY INEFFICIENT MARKET AT THAT TIME AND THERE WAS A LACK OF FINANCING THAT WE COULD HAVE MADE A LOT OF MONEY IF WE HAD BEEN GEARED UP FOR IT AT THAT TIME
YOU1000000184_S0000075	WE ACTUALLY HAD A FEW TRANSACTIONS THAT WERE PRETTY INTERESTING BUT NOT BUT NOTHING THAT WAS SIGNIFICANT IN RELATION TO OUR TOTAL CAPITAL
YOU1000000184_S0000076	WE THOUGHT SIGNIFICANTLY ABOUT BUYING THE URINE CORPORATION WHEN IT BECAME AVAILABLE SO
YOU1000000184_S0000078	THAT'S THE ONLY BIG ONE I CAN REMEMBER THAT WE SERIOUSLY THOUGHT ABOUT
YOU1000000184_S0000080	THAT WAS THE NINETEEN SEVENTY
YOU1000000184_S0000082	YEAH MOBIL OIL WAS INTERESTED YOU KNOW DON BRENT ENDED UP PUTTING TOGETHER A GROUP FOR IT BUT YOU KNOW THAT KIND OF THING
YOU1000000184_S0000084	CONCEIVABLY HAPPEN BUT BUT IT'S UNLIKELY
YOU1000000185_S0000001	HELLO EVERYONE AND WELCOME TO A VERY SPECIAL EDITION OF THE U S CHAMBER FOUNDATION'S PATH FORWARD SERIES
YOU1000000185_S0000002	YOU'VE BEEN A REGULAR VIEWER WELCOME BACK IF YOU'RE NEW TO THE SERIES THANK YOU FOR JOINING US WE HOPE YOU FIND IT BOTH INFORMATIVE AND INTERESTING
YOU1000000185_S0000003	AND BOY DID YOU PICK A GREAT WEEK TO TUNE IN OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS WE'VE BEEN BRINGING TOGETHER EXPERTS IN A NUMBER OF CRITICAL FIELDS
YOU1000000185_S0000004	ALL AROUND THE TOPIC OF RETURNING TO WORK TODAY WE'RE THRILLED TO BE JOINED BY TWO OF THE MOST IMPACTFUL PHILANTHROPISTS IN THE WORLD
YOU1000000185_S0000005	BILL AND MELINDA GATES HAVE DEDICATED THEIR LIVES TO ADVANCING SCIENCE AND IMPROVING PUBLIC HEALTH AMONG OTHER INITIATIVES
YOU1000000185_S0000006	U S CHAMBER FOUNDATION HAS A DEEP RELATIONSHIP WITH THE GATES FOUNDATION
YOU1000000185_S0000007	FOR MORE THAN A DECADE WE'VE WORKED TOGETHER ON BOTH K THROUGH TWELVE AND POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION REFORMS
YOU1000000185_S0000008	WE VALUE THEIR PARTNERSHIP AND WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO HAVE PHIL MELINDA GATES WITH US HERE TODAY
YOU1000000185_S0000009	AS YOU'VE LIKELY SEEN A FEW YEARS AGO BILL BROUGHT ATTENTION TO THE RISKS OF A DEADLY GLOBAL PANDEMIC SADLY HIS WARNING IS NOW OUR REALITY
YOU1000000185_S0000010	THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT HE AND MELINDA HAVE COMMITTED THEMSELVES AND THEIR ORGANIZATION TO FINDING A SOLUTION AND THAT GIVES US ALL A SENSE OF HOPE
YOU1000000185_S0000011	BILL MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION HAS COMMITTED MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO THE GLOBAL COVID NINETEEN RESPONSE
YOU1000000185_S0000012	WE'RE SO GRATEFUL FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP DURING THIS TRYING MOMENT AND EXCITED TO TALK TO THEM TODAY
YOU1000000185_S0000013	THIS EPISODE WAS PRERECORDED TO FIT THEIR BUSY SCHEDULE SO THERE WON'T BE AUDIENCE QUESTIONS AT THE END THIS TIME BUT THERE'S A LOT THAT WE GET TO TALK ABOUT AND SO LET'S GET TO IT
YOU1000000185_S0000015	WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING WITH US WE HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS WE JUST WANT TO JUMP RIGHT IN AND SO LET ME ASK YOU BOTH
YOU1000000185_S0000016	WHAT IS THE GATES FOUNDATION DOING TO FIGHT THE CORONAVIRUS AND WHY IS IT SUCH A PRIORITY FOR YOU
YOU1000000185_S0000018	OUR FOUNDATION HAS
YOU1000000185_S0000020	BIG FOCUS ON INFECTIOUS DISEASES THAT YOU KNOW KILL MILLIONS OF PEOPLE PRIMARILY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
YOU1000000185_S0000021	AND SO OUR UNDERSTANDING ABOUT HOW YOU DESIGN A VACCINE WE FUNDED LOTS OF NEW VACCINES
YOU1000000185_S0000022	WE'RE A PARTNER IN GOBY WHICH ACTUALLY BUYS VACCINES FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND WE HAVE A LOT OF THE EXPERTISE THAT'S NOT IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO
YOU1000000185_S0000023	WHICH OF THESE WE SHOULD BUILD FACTORIES FOR AND HOW WE COORDINATE ALL THIS ACTIVITY AND SO IT'S BECOME A HUGE FOCUS FORCE
YOU1000000185_S0000024	AND OF COURSE THE BENEFIT OF GETTING THE VACCINE YOU KNOW EVEN THREE OR FOUR MONTHS EARLIER WILL BE VERY DRAMATIC IN TERMS OF ENDING THESE
YOU1000000185_S0000025	AWFUL ECONOMIC EFFECTS AS WELL AS THE DEATH AND DISEASE
YOU1000000185_S0000027	MELINDA WHEN DO YOU THINK WE'LL SEE A VACCINE AT SCALE A TWO PART QUESTION
YOU1000000185_S0000028	YOU'VE ALSO TALKED BEAUTIFULLY ABOUT THE NEED TO HAVE AN EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF A VACCINE SO KIND OF WHEN DO YOU SEE THIS AT SCALE AND WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE DISTRIBUTION EQUITABLE
YOU1000000185_S0000029	YES SO I THINK WE ALL BELIEVE THAT JUST SEEING THE VARIOUS VACCINE CANDIDATES THAT ARE COMING THROUGH THE PIPELINE THERE ARE THREE THAT ARE LOOKING QUITE PROMISING LUCKILY
YOU1000000185_S0000030	AND I THINK WE ALL BELIEVE THAT BY TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE WILL HAVE A VACCINE
YOU1000000185_S0000031	WE'RE WORKING AHEAD OF TIME WITH THE WITH THE MANUFACTURERS WITH THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES TO TRY AND ACTUALLY HAVE MANUFACTURING CAPABILITY READY TO GO
YOU1000000185_S0000032	SO AS SOON AS THOSE TRIALS ARE FINISHED THE VACCINE CAN GO IMMEDIATELY INTO MANUFACTURING
YOU1000000185_S0000033	AND THE WHOLE REASON WE GOT INVOLVED IN THIS VACCINE WAS TO MAKE SURE THERE'S EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION
YOU1000000185_S0000034	THE LAST THING YOU WANT IS A BIDDING WAR BETWEEN COUNTRIES FOR THIS VACCINE YOU KNOW WE KNOW THERE ARE SIXTY MILLION HEALTH CARE WORKERS AROUND THE WORLD
YOU1000000185_S0000035	WHO ARE KEEPING EVERYBODY SAFE THEY DESERVE TO GET THIS VACCINE FIRST AND FROM THERE YOU WANT TO DO TEARING IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES
YOU1000000185_S0000036	TO MAKE SURE YOUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS GET IT IN OUR COUNTRY THAT WOULD BE BLACKS AND NATIVE AMERICANS PEOPLE WITH UNDERLYING HEALTH CONDITIONS AND THE ELDERLY
YOU1000000185_S0000037	AND SO WE NEED TO LOOK AT AS A GLOBE AND WE'RE INVOLVED WITH MANY EUROPEAN LEADERS AND AFRICAN LEADERS AND OTHERS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA TO MAKE SURE
YOU1000000185_S0000038	THERE'S A PURCHASING FUND THAT CAN PULL THAT VACCINE THROUGH WHEN IT'S AVAILABLE AND GET IT OUT IN WIDE SCALE DISTRIBUTION
YOU1000000185_S0000040	GOSH I HAVE SO MANY FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS I'LL TRY TO STAY FOCUSED SO LET ME GO BACK TO BILL FOR A SECOND YOU GOT WIDESPREAD ATTENTION FOR PREDICTION YOU MADE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN
YOU1000000185_S0000041	ABOUT THE DANGERS OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC AND YOU SADLY FOR THE WORLD DID PREDICT THE FUTURE AND SO LET ME ASK YOU TO DO IT AGAIN YOU KNOW WHAT ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT NOW
YOU1000000185_S0000043	THIS WON'T BE THE LAST PANDEMIC THAT WE FACE YOU KNOW PANDEMICS CAN COME FROM NATURAL CAUSES
YOU1000000185_S0000044	WHICH IS LARGELY COMING ACROSS FROM OTHER SPECIES YOU KNOW A FLU FOR EXAMPLE IS STILL A VERY BIG RISK
YOU1000000185_S0000045	AND SO WE'LL HAVE TO INVEST
YOU1000000185_S0000047	IN MAKING SURE THAT WE CATCH THE DISEASE SOONER AND THAT WE HAVE PLATFORMS TO MAKE DIAGNOSTICS THERAPEUTICS AND VACCINES VERY QUICKLY
YOU1000000185_S0000048	VERY LITTLE WAS INVESTED EVEN THOUGH THERE WERE THESE CALLS BY A LOT OF PEOPLE INCLUDING OUR FOUNDATION
YOU1000000185_S0000049	ONE GROUP THAT WAS FUNDED THE COALITION FOR EPIDEMIC PREPAREDNESS INNOVATION SEPPI
YOU1000000185_S0000050	WE WELCOME THOSE NORWAY UK JAPAN WERE THE INITIAL FUNDERS AND THAT IS HELPING OUT HERE
YOU1000000185_S0000051	SO WE'RE BETTER OFF THAN IF THAT HADN'T HAPPENED BUT YOU KNOW PEOPLE TRUST GOVERNMENT TO THINK THROUGH
YOU1000000185_S0000052	THESE EVENTUAL BAD THINGS THIS WAS A FAILURE TO TO GET READY
YOU1000000185_S0000053	AND THE COST WOULD HAVE BEEN TINY COMPARED TO SAY WHAT WE SPEND ON BEING READY FOR WAR WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY DO THE SIMULATION TO THINK ABOUT
YOU1000000185_S0000054	OKAY WHAT ABOUT NURSING HOMES WHAT ABOUT GETTING FACTORIES READY WHAT ABOUT THE TESTING REGIME
YOU1000000185_S0000055	YOU KNOW IN FACT THE TESTING COULD HAVE BEEN RAMPED UP VERY QUICKLY IN A FEW COUNTRIES THAT HAVE ALMOST AVOIDED THE EPIDEMIC ENTIRELY LIKE
YOU1000000185_S0000057	TAIWAN NEW ZEALAND AUSTRALIA YOU KNOW THEY TOOK THEIR EXPERIENCE AND ACTUALLY PREPARED AND SO THEY MOVED A LOT FASTER
YOU1000000185_S0000058	SO WE
YOU1000000185_S0000060	WE'LL HAVE TO PREPARE FOR THE NEXT ONE THAT
YOU1000000185_S0000062	I'D SAY WE'LL GET ATTENTION THIS TIME
YOU1000000185_S0000064	SO YOU KNOW THAT REMINDS ME OF GOING BACK TO THE VACCINE MELINDA AND I PROMISED TO MOVE OFF OF IT BUT YOU KNOW WE'VE NEVER HAD A VACCINE FOR CORONAVIRUS
YOU1000000185_S0000065	THAT MAKES PEOPLE NERVOUS ABOUT THIS TIME SO I THINK THE AUDIENCE WILL BE SO PLEASED TO HEAR YOUR OPTIMISM FOR THIS RIGHT BUT
YOU1000000185_S0000066	WHAT DO YOU THINK IS DIFFERENT THIS TIME THAT MAKES US THINK THE DEVELOPMENT WILL HAPPEN IS IT THIS GLOBAL COORDINATION
YOU1000000185_S0000067	IT'S THIS IT'S THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES WORKING TOGETHER WITH SCIENTISTS FROM ALL OVER THE GLOBE IN A VERY COORDINATED FASHION
YOU1000000185_S0000068	WE HAVE NEVER SEEN THE COMPANIES COME TOGETHER IN THIS WAY AND ALSO TO BE THINKING AHEAD ABOUT MANUFACTURING
YOU1000000185_S0000069	MANUFACTURING NOT JUST FOR THEIR OWN COUNTRY OR THEIR OWN REGION BUT FOR OTHER PLACES IN THE WORLD AND SO THAT'S WHAT MAKES US OPTIMISTIC IS THE MANY MANY CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'RE HAVING
YOU1000000185_S0000070	THE WAY WE'RE SEEING THE SCIENTISTS MOVE FORWARD WITH THE DATA AS SOON AS THEY GET IT AND ALSO SEEING GLOBAL LEADERS COME TOGETHER
YOU1000000185_S0000071	LIKE THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION DID A HUGE PLEDGING EVENT FOR THIS VACCINE ALLIANCE THAT WE'VE BEEN PART OF AND SEEING MONEY COME TOGETHER TO SAY
YOU1000000185_S0000072	WE NEED THIS SO THAT IT'S READY WHEN THE VACCINE IS READY TO GO WE CAN ACTUALLY PURCHASE THAT VACCINE FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD
YOU1000000185_S0000074	DO YOU THINK BILL THE SAME THING IS TRUE ON THERAPEUTICS AND TESTING I MEAN DO YOU THINK THAT THE WAY THAT THINGS ARE COMING TOGETHER WILL GET US WHERE WE NEED TO BE
YOU1000000185_S0000075	THE OTHER SIDE OF THE EQUATION AS WELL
YOU1000000185_S0000077	PEOPLE ARE CAUGHT A LITTLE BIT FLATFOOTED IN THAT USUALLY THE U S IS VERY WELL ORGANIZED SO THE
YOU1000000185_S0000078	THIS NEW DRUG THAT GOT PROVEN OUT THAT'S A TRIAL NETWORK WE FUNDED WITH OTHERS WITH WELCOME TRUST IN THE UK
YOU1000000185_S0000079	YOU KNOW USUALLY YOU EXPECT THE US TO DO GOOD COORDINATED TRIALS AND YOU KNOW TO PICK DRUGS FOR THEIR SCIENTIFIC MERIT
YOU1000000185_S0000080	THE WORLD HAS HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A HARD TIME WHEN THE THE US TESTING THING WENT IN THE WRONG DIRECTION
YOU1000000185_S0000081	WHEN IT HASN'T BEEN YOU KNOW A FEDERAL NOTION OF HOW YOU PRIORITIZE THINGS BUT I HAVE TO SAY THE EUROPEANS ARE FILLING THAT VACUUM PARTICULARLY IN TERMS OF CARING
YOU1000000185_S0000082	FOR THE ENTIRE WORLD THEIR GENEROSITY HAS BEEN QUITE GOOD YOU KNOW PEOPLE HOPE THAT THE U S COMES BACK
YOU1000000185_S0000083	ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW WITHDRAWING FROM WHO IS A STEP IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION BUT HISTORICALLY THE US YOU KNOW WE DID SMALLPOX ERADICATION
YOU1000000185_S0000084	READERS BEEN BEHIND THE POLIO PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE WHICH IS DONE THROUGH WHO
YOU1000000185_S0000085	YOU KNOW A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE US MONEY IS THAT GOES THERE IS FOR THAT POLIO ERADICATION AND SO YOU KNOW THERE'S STILL A CHANCE FOR THE US
YOU1000000185_S0000086	CONTRIBUTE ON THIS AND YOU KNOW NOT JUST THINKING OF ITSELF BUT ALSO IN THE SAME WAY WE DID
YOU1000000185_S0000087	AND PARTICULARLY PRESIDENT BUSH AND PEPPARD DID HELPING OUT THE ENTIRE WORLD
YOU1000000185_S0000089	KNOW YOU'VE BOTH BEEN REALLY VOCAL ABOUT THE NEED TO MAKE THIS GLOBAL RESPONSE AND TO HELP PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF OUR BORDERS
YOU1000000185_S0000090	IF YOU WERE TALKING TO IN THIS AUDIENCE A SMALL BUSINESS PERSON IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY SOMEWHERE WHO MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND THAT
YOU1000000185_S0000091	EXPLAIN WHY YOU THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE REACH BEYOND OUR BORDERS AND HELP CONTROL THIS VIRUS
YOU1000000185_S0000092	WELL I THINK YOU KNOW COVID ANYWHERE IS COVID EVERYWHERE AND SO FOR A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER
YOU1000000185_S0000093	YOU KNOW THE SUPPLIES THAT COME IN THAT HELP YOU RUN YOUR BUSINESS DON'T ALL NECESSARILY COME FROM THE UNITED STATES
YOU1000000185_S0000095	AND YOUR CUSTOMERS PROBABLY AREN'T ALL JUST US CUSTOMERS AND SO IF WE WANT TO HAVE GLOBAL TRADE AND GLOBAL SUPPLY
YOU1000000185_S0000096	GLOBAL MANUFACTURING WE HAVE TO GET THE WHOLE WORLD COORDINATED IN ITS RESPONSE TO THIS DISEASE BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE CONTAINED
YOU1000000185_S0000097	IN ONE OR TWO PLACES EVEN ONCE WE'VE GOTTEN IT OUTSIDE OF THE US BORDERS
YOU1000000185_S0000098	AND TO PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE THE US HAS SPENT TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO TRY AND DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM HERE WE'RE ONLY TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW LESS THAN A FEW PERCENT
YOU1000000185_S0000099	THAT OF THAT THAT WOULD NEED TO BE SPENT ON HELPING GET RID OF THE DISEASE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD
YOU1000000185_S0000100	IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S SOME GIGANTIC TRADEOFF YOU KNOW THESE ARE VERY SMALL DOLLARS JUST LIKE YOU KNOW THE WHO IS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR
YOU1000000185_S0000101	YOU KNOW FOR THINGS LIKE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH VACCINES POLIO COVERS A LOT OF DIFFERENT AREAS
YOU1000000185_S0000102	AND SO IT'S NOT COMPETING BUDGETWISE WITH THE LARGE SCALE RESOURCES
YOU1000000185_S0000104	YOU KNOW YOUR FOUNDATION DOES AMAZING WORK WE'VE BEEN LUCKY TO BE PARTNERS FOR A LONG TIME ON SOME K THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION WORK
YOU1000000185_S0000105	VERY GRATEFUL TO RECEIVE THAT SUPPORT AND AMPLIFY THAT GOOD WORK AND IT MAKES ME WONDER ABOUT HOW THE WORLD IS CHANGING IN A BROADER SENSE
YOU1000000185_S0000106	AS A RESULT OF THIS VIRUS I MEAN WHAT DO YOU MEAN LINDA LET ME GO TO YOU FIRST WHAT DO YOU THINK WE'RE GONNA SEE IN TERMS OF SOME LASTING CHANGES
YOU1000000185_S0000107	AS A RESULT OF THIS HEALTH AND ECONOMIC CRISIS
YOU1000000185_S0000108	WELL I THINK THAT'S YET TO COME AND I THINK YOU KNOW IT'S UP TO US AS CITIZENS TO REBUILD THE WORLD THAT WE WANT
YOU1000000185_S0000109	I THINK THIS CRISIS HAS EXPOSED SOME OF THE GAPS AROUND THE WORLD BUT PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED STATES
YOU1000000185_S0000110	AND ONE OF THOSE IN PARTICULAR ARE THE GENDER AND THE RACIAL INEQUITIES THAT EXIST
YOU1000000185_S0000111	IN TERMS OF GENDER YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT WOMEN DO TWO AND A HALF TIMES MORE WORK AT HOME THAN MEN DO AND THAT'S THE UNPAID LABOUR
YOU1000000185_S0000112	CARING FOR THE KIDS MAKING THE LUNCH MAKING SURE THEY'RE ONLINE LEARNING RIGHT NOW
YOU1000000185_S0000113	AND SO YOU KNOW IT WILL EXPOSE FOR US THAT IT IS JUST WAY PAST TIME THAT THE US HAS A PAID FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE POLICY WE'RE THE ONLY INDUSTRIALIZED NATION THAT DOESN'T
YOU1000000185_S0000114	AND IF WE WANT TO PUT PEOPLE BACK TO WORK SAFELY AND KEEP THEIR FAMILIES SAFE FROM FROM GETTING SICK WE NEED TO HAVE PAID FAMILY MEDICAL
YOU1000000185_S0000115	AND SO I THINK CONGRESS IN ITS WISDOM AND TWO OF THE STIMULUS BILLS STARTED TO ADDRESS THAT WE NEED LONG TERM SOLUTION
YOU1000000185_S0000116	THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY IS NOT ONLY HAS COVID EXPOSED THE GAPS IN THE SYSTEM IT'S ALSO SHOWED US OPPORTUNITIES LIKE THE FACT THAT KIDS COULD JUMP ON
YOU1000000185_S0000117	START LEARNING NOW UNFORTUNATELY IT'S NOT ALL KIDS BECAUSE MANY KIDS DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO A COMPUTER OR GOOD DIGITAL LITERACY ONLINE
YOU1000000185_S0000118	TEACHERS WHO KNEW HOW TO TEACH ONLINE BUT WE KNOW NOW IT'S POSSIBLE AND SO I THINK NOW WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT TECHNOLOGY GETS SPREAD EQUITABLY
YOU1000000185_S0000119	AND THOSE GREAT LESSON PLANS AND ADVISING THAT CAN HAPPEN I THINK ONE LAST EXAMPLE I'LL GIVE ON DIGITAL IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD
YOU1000000185_S0000120	THERE ARE MANY MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE PHONES AND DO DIGITAL BANKING ON THEIR PHONE THEY HAVE ACCESS TO MONEY ON THEIR PHONE MOBILE MONEY THAT WAS AT SCALE IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES
YOU1000000185_S0000121	BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN PEOPLE REALLY SAID OH MY GOSH TO NOT HAVE TO STAND IN LINE FOR MY GOVERNMENT PAYMENT WHERE I MIGHT GET SICK
YOU1000000185_S0000122	SO JUST TO TAKE PAKISTAN ALONE IN FORTY EIGHT HOURS FORTY MILLION ADDITIONAL PEOPLE SIGNED UP FOR A DIGITAL BANK ACCOUNT THAT IS AN OPPORTUNITY WE CAN USE
YOU1000000185_S0000123	AND PARTICULARLY USED TO REACH LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND WOMEN ON THAT PHONE WITH ALL KINDS OF THINGS LIKE CASH TRANSFERS
YOU1000000185_S0000124	MORE INFORMATION MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHEN HEALTH SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE SO
YOU1000000185_S0000125	SOME OF THOSE DIGITAL OPPORTUNITIES ARE REALLY HITTING IN WAYS WE DIDN'T EXPECT AS QUICKLY AS WE HAD BEEN HAD THOUGHT THEY WOULD
YOU1000000185_S0000127	I LOVE THAT ANSWER BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A LOT WE'RE AFRAID OF RIGHT NOW BOTH IN TERMS OF HEALTH AND THE ECONOMY AND HOW TO WRITE THIS SOCIAL INJUSTICE
YOU1000000185_S0000128	AND THERE'S A LOT WE'RE AFRAID OF AND IT'S NICE TO THINK ABOUT SOME OPTIMISTIC YOU KNOW OUTCOMES FOR THIS TOO SO THE OTHER DAY IN AN INTERVIEW DAVID RUBENSTEIN ASKED ME
YOU1000000185_S0000129	WHAT I HAD LEARNED ABOUT WORKING REMOTELY AND I ADMITTED TO HIM THAT I WAS CONDUCTING A LOT OF INTERVIEWS WITHOUT SHOES ON
YOU1000000185_S0000130	I'M PLEADING THE FIFTH ABOUT MY SHOELESS STATE AT THE MOMENT BUT WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED ABOUT YOURSELVES IN THIS TIME AND WHAT HAS CHANGED ABOUT THE WAY THAT YOU'RE WORKING
YOU1000000185_S0000132	IT'S IMPRESSIVE THAT FOR OFFICE WORK IT
YOU1000000185_S0000134	PARTLY BUILDING ON THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT YOU BUILT UP OVER TIME YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO QUITE WELL YOU KNOW OUR FOUNDATION HAS
YOU1000000185_S0000136	NOBODY'S BEEN IN THE OFFICE FOR OVER THREE MONTHS NOW AND YET OUR WORK IS GOING ON PRETTY MUCH FULL SPEED
YOU1000000185_S0000137	AND YOU KNOW BECAUSE I'M INVOLVED WITH SOFTWARE I THINK OKAY WE CAN MAKE THE SOFTWARE PLATFORMS EVEN BETTER
YOU1000000185_S0000138	YOU KNOW MAKE IT EASY TO TAKE NOTES OR SHARE THINGS OR HAVE SIDE CONVERSATIONS
YOU1000000185_S0000139	BUT IT'S BEEN DECENT ENOUGH TO ALLOW A LOT TO HAPPEN AND IT'S CERTAINLY GOING TO ACCELERATE THE IDEA OF DO WE NEED TO TRAVEL AS MUCH
YOU1000000185_S0000141	YOU KNOW HOW GOOD CAN WE MAKE ONLINE EDUCATION HOW GOOD CAN WE MAKE TELEMEDICINE
YOU1000000185_S0000142	IT IT YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE TEN YEARS
YOU1000000185_S0000144	PROGRESS ON THOSE THINGS WILL GET COMPRESSED DOWN INTO JUST A COUPLE YEARS
YOU1000000185_S0000146	
YOU1000000185_S0000147	I WOULD SAY OUR LIVES YOU KNOW LIKE EVERYBODY AROUND THE UNITED STATES HAVE CHANGED SUBSTANTIALLY WE'RE INCREDIBLY FORTUNATE NOT TO BE STRUGGLING TO PUT A MEAL ON THE TABLE WE JUST ARE LUCKY
YOU1000000185_S0000148	BUT YES OUR WORK LIVES YOU KNOW WORKING FROM HOME WAS NOT SOMETHING WE DID AS MUCH BEFORE WE'RE CERTAINLY USING A LOT OF MICROSOFT TEAMS AND ZOOM AND OTHER THINGS

YOU1000000185_S0000151	I THINK THERE WILL ABSOLUTELY BE MEETINGS I TRAVEL FOR AND YOU KNOW I STILL THINK THERE WILL BE ABSOLUTELY REASONS TO GO TO AFRICA AND SOUTHEAST ASIA
YOU1000000185_S0000152	BUT I THINK CONFERENCES CAN BE CHANGED AND WE'RE SEEING MANY MANY PEOPLE DO THEM ONLINE NOW AND SO I DO THINK I WILL TRAVEL LESS WHICH I THINK WILL GIVE ME MORE TIME TO JUST ENJOY LIFE
YOU1000000185_S0000153	AND TAKE THE BREAKS THAT I TAKE HERE IN SEATTLE BETWEEN MY ZOOM MEETINGS TO STEP OUTSIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE
YOU1000000185_S0000154	WELL I DON'T KNOW THAT THE WORLD CAN TAKE YOU GUYS TAKING TOO MUCH TIME OFF I THINK WE NEED YOUR HARD WORK AND BIG HEARTS FOR THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE FACING

YOU1000000186_S0000013	I CAN GIVE YOU A LITTLE ANECDOTE WHEN ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO OR MAYBE A LITTLE MORE THAN THAT WHEN BILL GATES WAS IN HIS PHASE ONE OF HIS LIFE
YOU1000000186_S0000014	AND WE WERE TALKING TO A WHOLE LOT OF SOFTWARE PEOPLE RATHER THAN MORE INTERESTING PEOPLE LIKE YOU
YOU1000000186_S0000015	I ASKED HIM TO GIVE A SOUND CHECK SAY ONE TWO THREE FOUR
YOU1000000186_S0000016	AND HE SAID ONE BILLION TWO BILLION THREE BILLION
YOU1000000186_S0000018	HE WAS COUNTING NOTES THERE NOW HE'S COUNTING PEOPLE BEING SAVED BY VACCINATION BY VACCINES IN TERMS OF MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF THEM
YOU1000000186_S0000019	IT'S A HUGE TERRIFIC CHANGE IN YOUR LIFE PHASE TWO
YOU1000000186_S0000020	AND AMID IN A WAY YOU'VE ALSO MOVED FROM OF COURSE YOU HAVEN'T GIVEN UP YOUR EARLIER ACTING CAREER
YOU1000000186_S0000021	YOU'VE ALSO MOVED ONTO SOCIAL ISSUES WITH THIS MOST PATHBREAKING TELEVISION PROGRAM WHICH HAD A HUGE IMPACT
YOU1000000186_S0000022	AND EVERYBODY SAID YOU'RE NUTS WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS SORT OF STUFF WHY DON'T YOU STICK TO MOVIES SO WHAT MOTIVATED WHAT WHAT CAUSED THAT CHANGE
YOU1000000186_S0000023	YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW I THINK IT'S A
YOU1000000186_S0000025	YOU KNOW I WAS I WAS AT A DISCUSSION SOMETIME BACK AND YOU KNOW ONE OF THE QUESTIONS ASKED
YOU1000000186_S0000027	WHAT WHAT ARE THE
YOU1000000186_S0000029	WHAT ARE THE GOOD QUALITIES THAT THAT A GOOD ENGER SHOULD HAVE THE QUESTIONS ASKED
YOU1000000186_S0000031	
YOU1000000186_S0000032	AND HE SAID THAT ONE OF THE GOOD QUALITIES ANY NGO SHOULD HAVE ANY PERSON WHO WANTS TO BE PART OF SOCIAL YOU KNOW SERVICE SHOULD HAVE IS THAT
YOU1000000186_S0000034	IT'S NOT JUST THE EMOTION OF WANTING TO DO SOMETHING FOR SOMEBODY ELSE WHICH IS IN ITSELF A GOOD EMOTION THAT YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING FOR SOMEONE
YOU1000000186_S0000035	BUT IF YOU FEEL THAT YOUR LIFE IS INCOMPLETE IF YOU DON'T
YOU1000000186_S0000036	
YOU1000000186_S0000037	YOU'RE DOING IT FOR YOURSELF REALLY
YOU1000000186_S0000038	
YOU1000000186_S0000039	OF COURSE YOU'RE DOING IT FOR SOMEONE ELSE BUT AND I THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT IS IMPORTANT AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS TO YOU IF YOU FEEL LIKE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO HAPPEN TO YOU
YOU1000000186_S0000040	BUT I THINK IN ME WHAT GREW WAS THAT THIS FEELING THAT I THAT I NEEDED TO FOR MYSELF DO SOMETHING WHERE I FELT BETTER ABOUT MYSELF WHEN I FELT I WAS YOU KNOW I FEEL I'M SO PRIVILEGED IN SO MANY WAYS
YOU1000000186_S0000041	AND I FEEL THAT I REALLY FEEL THAT WHEN I SEE AROUND ME PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT AS PRIVILEGED I CAN'T JUST SIT BY AND BE COMFORTABLE
YOU1000000186_S0000042	THERE'S A NEED IN ME TO YOU KNOW REACH OUT AND PERHAPS
YOU1000000186_S0000044	YOU'RE LUCKY TO HAVE A POSITION WHERE PEOPLE WILL LISTEN
YOU1000000186_S0000046	LIKE TO USE IT TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITIES
YOU1000000186_S0000048	I GUESS THAT'S WHY I'VE MOVED INTO THE SPACE WHERE I HAVE IT'S FOR MY OWN EMOTIONAL OR MENTAL YOU KNOW PEACE OF MIND AND SATISFACTION
YOU1000000186_S0000049	AND BILL GATES
YOU1000000186_S0000051	YOU'VE ALSO GOT A LITTLE MORE EMOTIONAL IN PHASE TWO
YOU1000000186_S0000052	I'VE SEEN YOU ALMOST CHOKED UP TALKING ABOUT YOUR DAD ABOUT HOW YOUR WIFE MOTIVATED YOU HOW YOUR DAD'S YOUR HERO AND HOW ALL THIS MEANS A LITTLE MORE TO YOUR HEART THAN YOUR HEAD
YOU1000000186_S0000053	SO WHAT MOTIVATED YOU TO MAKE THIS CHANGE
YOU1000000186_S0000055	I THINK IT'S VERY SIMILAR I LOVED MY CAREER IN SOFTWARE AND BEING PART OF BUILDING MICROSOFT THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY THE INTERNET
YOU1000000186_S0000056	IN MY TWENTY S AND THIRTY S I WAS FANATICAL
YOU1000000186_S0000057	
YOU1000000186_S0000058	AND I SAW WHAT INNOVATION COULD DO
YOU1000000186_S0000059	BUT THERE CAME A POINT WHERE I THOUGHT HEY I SHOULD TURN THAT WORK OVER TO OTHER PEOPLE
YOU1000000186_S0000060	AND THINK ABOUT HOW INNOVATION DOESN'T NATURALLY BENEFIT EVERYONE IT DOESN'T REACH DOWN TO THE POOREST IN FACT I'D GOTTEN A CHANCE TO SEE SOME OF THAT AS I TRAVELED THE WORLD
YOU1000000186_S0000061	AND AS A BIG BELIEVER IN INNOVATION I THOUGHT OKAY WE WE CAN PUSH IT IN THAT DIRECTION
YOU1000000186_S0000062	AND SO IT'S ALLOWED ME TO LEARN A LOT OF NEW THINGS
YOU1000000186_S0000063	AND I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO IT EXCEPT FOR THE THE LACK THE VISIBILITY THE RESOURCES THAT CAME FROM THAT FIRST CAREER
YOU1000000186_S0000064	AND I ACTUALLY USE A LOT OF WHAT I LEARNED THEN IN TERMS OF ENGAGING SCIENTISTS AND DRIVING INNOVATION AS FAST AS WE CAN
YOU1000000186_S0000065	AND HOW IMPORTANT WAS YOUR WIFE IN THIS CHAPTER TWO OF YOUR LIFE
YOU1000000186_S0000067	WHEN I FIRST SAID TO MY WIFE THAT I WAS CONSIDERING RETIRING FROM MY FULL TIME WORK AT MICROSOFT
YOU1000000186_S0000069	YOU CRAZY
YOU1000000186_S0000070	WELL SHE SHE WAS CAREFUL NOT TO JUMP ON IT BECAUSE SHE WANTED IT TO BE MY DECI
YOU1000000186_S0000071	
YOU1000000186_S0000072	YOU KNOW THAT I WOULD NEVER LOOK BACK AND FELT LIKE THAT WASN'T THAT I REALLY PICKED THE TIME THAT I FELT COMFORTABLE WITH THAT BECAUSE IT'S BEEN SO CENTRAL TO MY LIFE
YOU1000000186_S0000073	
YOU1000000186_S0000074	BUT SHE WAS CERTAINLY ENTHUSED ABOUT IT DURING MY TIME AT MICROSOFT I'D ALWAYS HAD SOMEBODY WHO WAS
YOU1000000186_S0000076	MY KEY PARTNER PAUL ALLEN
YOU1000000186_S0000078	STEVE BALLMER'S THE COMPANY BECAME BIG AND COMPLICATED
YOU1000000186_S0000079	NOW IN THIS ERA IT'S REALLY MY WIFE WHO'S
YOU1000000186_S0000081	AND SO WE GET TO DO THIS TOGETHER
YOU1000000186_S0000082	AND GREAT MOTIVATOR SHE'S A DRIVING FORCE BEHIND A LOT OF WHAT YOU DO
YOU1000000186_S0000083	ABSOLUTELY EVER ENERGETIC ABOUT THESE THINGS SHE'S ACTUALLY IN MALAYSIA THIS WEEK AT A WOMAN DELIVERS CONFERENCE TALKING ABOUT REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND HOW WOMEN GET ACCESS TO THOSE TOOLS
YOU1000000186_S0000084	SHE'S EQUALLY PASSIONATE AND ALSO HAD A MICROSOFT CAREER SO SOME OF THE WAYS WE THINK ABOUT MEASUREMENT AND MANAGING PEOPLE GETTING THE BEST PEOPLE
YOU1000000186_S0000085	WE'VE GOT A COMMON BACKGROUND
YOU1000000186_S0000086	AMIR WHEN BILL GATES KIND OF LAUNCHED INTO THIS PHASE TWO HE TALKED TO AND CONVINCED A LOT OF BILLIONAIRES AROUND THE WORLD ESPECIALLY WARREN BUFFETT
YOU1000000186_S0000087	TO DONATE A LOT TO BE PHILANTHROPIC AND DONATE TO HIS ORGANIZATION OR TO OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AND TO MAKE CHANGE
YOU1000000186_S0000088	WHAT ABOUT IN INDIA WE DON'T SEE ENOUGH OF THAT WE'VE GOT A GREAT EXAMPLE OF
YOU1000000186_S0000090	YOU HIGHLIGHTED IN YOUR
YOU1000000186_S0000091	YEAH IN OUR SHOW WE DID SHOWCASE WHAT
YOU1000000186_S0000093	AND I THINK HE'S DOING REALLY WONDERFUL WORK AND REALLY WE SHOULD ALL TAKE YOU FROM THAT
YOU1000000186_S0000094	AND CERTAINLY I FEEL THAT I MEAN I DO BELIEVE THAT IN INDIA THERE IS A LOT OF PHILANTHROPY
YOU1000000186_S0000095	
YOU1000000186_S0000097	HUGE AMOUNTS THAT WE OFTEN DONATE BUT IT'S USUALLY TO RELIGIOUS
YOU1000000186_S0000098	
YOU1000000186_S0000099	ORGANIZATIONS WE DONATE A LOT TO RELIGION
YOU1000000186_S0000100	
YOU1000000186_S0000101	MAYBE THAT IS A NEED IN US TO TRY AND SAFEGUARD
YOU1000000186_S0000103	INSURANCE POLICY
YOU1000000186_S0000104	YEAH YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE FEEL THAT IF WE DONATE A LOT TO TEMPLES OR MOSQUES OR YOU KNOW RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS AND AND THAT'S WHERE I SEE MOST OF THE BIG DONATIONS GOING SO IT'S NOT THAT THE IT'S NOT THAT WE DON'T DONATE
YOU1000000186_S0000105	
YOU1000000186_S0000106	DONATE HUGE AMOUNTS BUT THEY GO INTO RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS WHEREAS WE DON'T DONATE YOU KNOW INTO EDUCATION OR INTO HEALTHCARE
YOU1000000186_S0000108	AND I PERSONALLY FEEL THAT IF YOU IF YOU YOU KNOW DONATE INTO EDUCATION AND HEALTHCARE
YOU1000000186_S0000110	THE GOUT THERE'S GOING TO BE REALLY HAPPY
YOU1000000186_S0000112	PROBABLY HAPPIER SO I MEAN I THINK THAT I THINK IT'S TIME THAT THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE WELL OFF FINANCIALLY IN INDIA AND WHO WOULD LIKE TO CONTRIBUTE TO NATION BUILDING
YOU1000000186_S0000113	
YOU1000000186_S0000114	BUILDING THIS NATION INTO WHAT IT CAN BE AND TO TRYING TO ACHIEVE ITS FULL POTENTIAL FOR THE YOUTH FOR THE KIDS OF OUR COUNTRY
YOU1000000186_S0000115	AND FOR THE FOR THE YOU KNOW THE EMOTIONAL HAPPINESS FOR ALL OF US THEN THAT IS ONE ONE AREA THAT WE CAN REALLY HELP IN
YOU1000000186_S0000116	DO YOU THINK IS IN
YOU1000000186_S0000117	IN DONATING HUGE SUMS INTO EDUCATION HEALTHCARE AND OTHER SUCH THINGS
YOU1000000186_S0000119	RATHER THAN JUST RELIGION
YOU1000000186_S0000120	DO YOU THINK LIKE YOU NEED TWO HANDS TO CLAP IT'S A BIT OF A FAILURE ON THE THE LACK OF INSTITUTIONS THAT THEY CAN FEEL SAFE THAT THE MONEY'S GONE TO THE RIGHT PLACE
YOU1000000186_S0000121	IF YOU DONATE TO THE PRIME MINISTER'S RELIEF FUND YOU JUST FEEL GOD KNOWS WHAT'LL HAPPEN WHERE IT'LL GO PART OF THE BUDGET
YOU1000000186_S0000122	BUT IF YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING AN INDIAN EQUIVALENT OF THE GATES FOUNDATION OR SOMETHING WHERE YOU KNOW
YOU1000000186_S0000123	I SPEND THE MONEY HERE IT'S NOT GOING TO GO TOO MUCH TO SALARIES IT'S GOING TO GO TARGETED
YOU1000000186_S0000124	DON'T AGREE WITH THAT ENTIRELY
YOU1000000186_S0000126	BECAUSE I FEEL THAT WHILE YES WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT YOU KNOW WHERE ARE WE PUTTING OUR MONEY
YOU1000000186_S0000127	WHERE ARE WE DOING TICKET THAT'S A CONCERN WHICH ALL OF US SHOULD HAVE CERTAINLY BUT I DON'T THINK THAT YOU WON'T FIND ANY INSTITUTION
YOU1000000186_S0000129	YOU WILL IF YOU REALLY ARE INTERESTED I DON'T THINK IT'S
YOU1000000186_S0000131	THAT'S NOT A SUFFICIENT EXCUSE AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED
YOU1000000186_S0000132	BILL GATES WHEN YOU MEET INDIAN ENTREPRENEURS BILLIONAIRES ARE YOU GETTING ANY TRACTION WITH THEM THAT THEY SHOULD ALSO DONATE AND DO THE SECOND MIRACLE A MIRACLE OF SAY VACCINES
YOU1000000186_S0000133	I'M SURE THAT PHILANTHROPY IN INDIA WILL CONTINUE TO GROW
YOU1000000186_S0000134	I THINK THERE'S AN AWARENESS THAT ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT CAN DO A LOT THAT THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT ARE INNOVATIVE
YOU1000000186_S0000135	WHETHER IT'S GOOD SCHOOLS SHOWING THE WAY ON THAT PEOPLE
YOU1000000186_S0000137	I THINK DO AN AMAZING JOB AND I'M SURE THERE'S OTHERS OUT THERE LIKE THAT
YOU1000000186_S0000138	IN AGRICULTURE
YOU1000000186_S0000140	YOU KNOW GETTING SMART YOUNG PEOPLE GETTING OUT THERE PUSHING INNOVATIVE TECHNIQUES
YOU1000000186_S0000141	AND SO YES PHILANTHROPY IS GOING TO GROW THE ONLY THING I DO IS AS PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN PHILANTHROPY I SHARE WITH THEM HOW MUCH FUN IT CAN BE
YOU1000000186_S0000142	AND TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT AS YOU MOVE FROM THE PLACE THAT YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL USUALLY IN BUSINESS YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE
YOU1000000186_S0000143	BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN AN AREA WHERE THE MEASURES ARE NOT AS CLEAR
YOU1000000186_S0000144	AND YOU HAVEN'T HAD THE TWENTY OR THIRTY YEAR PERIOD OF EXPERIENCE WHERE YOU'RE REALLY FAMILIAR WITH THE TERRITORY
YOU1000000186_S0000145	YOU WILL HAVE TO ENGAGE WITH THE GOVERNMENT AT LEAST TO SHOW THE WAY ON CERTAIN ISSUES SO IT IT'S TRICKY
YOU1000000186_S0000146	I THINK ONE OF THE EARLIEST PHILANTHROPISTS ANYWHERE WAS THE CAT FAMILY
YOU1000000186_S0000147	THEY WERE ACTUALLY A FEW YEARS YEAH THAT'S EVEN BEFORE ROCKEFELLER AND AND CARNEGIE
YOU1000000186_S0000148	AND I LEARNED A LOT FROM THOSE EARLY FOUNDATIONS BECAUSE THEY WERE PRETTY BRILLIANT IN WHAT THEY DID
YOU1000000186_S0000149	
YOU1000000186_S0000150	AND I THINK THE MORE PEOPLE GIVE THE MORE AND REMEDIES THERE ARE THE MORE IT MAKES OTHER PEOPLE THINK OKAY SHOULD I DO THE SAME
YOU1000000186_S0000151	AND SO I HOPE
YOU1000000186_S0000153	THAT TEN YEARS NOW WE CAN SAY THAT THIS WAS THE GOLDEN ERA OF PHILANTHROPY IN INDIA AND THE REST OF THE WORLD
YOU1000000186_S0000154	YOU DO FIND SOME TRACTION WHEN YOU TALK TO THEM
YOU1000000186_S0000155	ABSOLUTELY THE INTEREST IN DISCUSSION IS IS VERY STRONG IN FACT THERE'VE BEEN A NUMBER OF MEETINGS AND PEOPLE ARE FINDING THEIR WAY
YOU1000000186_S0000156	THAT BOUNDARY OF HOW YOU CONNECT AND YOU KNOW SHOW MODELS FOR THE GOVERNMENT THAT'S TAKEN SOME CAPACITY BUILDING IS TAKING PLACE
YOU1000000186_S0000157	THE US IS IN THIS RESPECT FURTHER DOWN THE LEARNING CURVE THERE'S NO LACK OF PLACES TO GIVE
YOU1000000186_S0000158	AND TO SOME DEGREE THE UNIVERSITIES HAVE TO REACH OUT A LITTLE MORE AND SAY OKAY HERE'S A PROGRAM THAT YOU COULD FUND
YOU1000000186_S0000159	AND THEY SHOULD LOOK AT HOW THAT'S HAPPENED IN THE US WHICH IS
YOU1000000186_S0000161	VERY ORGANIZED BEAUTIFULLY ORGANIZED UNIVERSITIES OF AMERICA
YOU1000000187_S0000001	SO WHEN I WAS TEACHING THIS WAS ONE OF THE TESTS WILL I WILL ASK YOU KNOW HOW YOU KNOW YOU'RE AN ARTIST THAT'S THE MAIN QUESTION AND YOU KNOW
YOU1000000187_S0000002	TO KNOW AN ARTIST OR NOT IS LIKE BREATHING YOU DON'T QUESTION BREATHING YOU HAVE TO BREATHE OTHERWISE YOU JUST DIE SO YOU BREATHE SO IF YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING
YOU1000000187_S0000003	AND YOU HAVE SOME IDEAS AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE THEM AND IT'S BECOME LIKE A KIND OF ALMOST OBSESSION AND YOU HAVE TO CREATE AND YOU HAVE THIS URGE TO CREATE YOU'RE DEFINITELY AN ARTIST
YOU1000000187_S0000004	BUT YOU'RE NOT A GREAT ARTIST YOU'RE JUST AN ARTIST TO BE A GREAT ARTIST THAT'S ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF RULES AND AND YOU REALLY HAVE TO
YOU1000000187_S0000005	HAVE TO KIND OF IT'S LIKE IT'S LIKE OBSESSED YOU IT'S LIKE IT'S LIKE NOTHING ELSE IN YOUR MIND
YOU1000000187_S0000006	THE ONLY ADVICE YOU EVER HEAR IS SOMETHING YOU ALREADY KNOW AND IT JUST GETS CONFIRMED IF YOU THINK OF ALL THE ADVICE THAT YOU'VE HEARD FIFTY MILLION PIECES OF ADVICE PEOPLE
YOU1000000187_S0000007	AND THERE MAY BE THREE OR FOUR PIECES OF ADVICE YOU CAN THINK OF HAVING TAKEN
YOU1000000187_S0000008	WHEN I WAS REALLY YOUNG WILLIAM BURROUGHS TOLD ME I WAS REALLY STRUGGLING WE NEVER HAD ANY MONEY AND
YOU1000000187_S0000009	AND WILLIAM THE ADVICE THAT WILLIAM GAVE ME WAS BUILD A GOOD NAME YOU KNOW KEEP YOUR NAME CLEAN
YOU1000000187_S0000010	DON'T MAKE COMPROMISES DON'T WORRY ABOUT MAKING A BUNCH OF MONEY OR BEING SUCCESSFUL BE CONCERNED WITH DOING GOOD WORK
YOU1000000187_S0000011	AND MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICES AND PROTECT YOUR WORK AND IF YOU BUILD A GOOD NAME EVENTUALLY YOU KNOW THAT NAME WILL BE ITS OWN CURRENCY
YOU1000000187_S0000012	THE ONLY ADVICE I HAVE IS PROBABLY THINGS THAT A LOT OF YOUNG MUSICIANS AND ARTISTS ALREADY KNOW THAT
YOU1000000187_S0000014	ALTHOUGH SOME OF THEM MAY HAVE THE AMBITION TO BE THE NEXT THE NEXT OR THE NEXT WHATEVER
YOU1000000187_S0000015	WHATEVER IT IS THE NUMBER OF THOSE ARTISTS ARE VERY VERY SMALL
YOU1000000187_S0000017	AND OFTEN THE ARTISTS WHO ARE VERY SUCCESSFUL THAT WAY
YOU1000000187_S0000019	THEY
YOU1000000187_S0000021	THEY DON'T HAVE MUCH FLEXIBILITY THEY IN ACHIEVING SUCCESS THEY KIND OF LOSE A LOT OF THEIR CREATIVE FREEDOM
YOU1000000187_S0000022	THEY HAVE TO KEEP MAKING THE SAME THING MORE OR LESS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND THAT IF THE MUSICIAN OR ARTIST VALUES THEIR FREEDOM AND
YOU1000000187_S0000023	THE ABILITY TO BE CREATIVE THEN THEY HAVE TO MAYBE REALIZE THAT THEY WON'T BE MAKING
YOU1000000187_S0000025	HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THEY MIGHT BE MAKING LESS MONEY BUT THEY MIGHT HAVE MORE ARTISTIC SATISFACTION
YOU1000000187_S0000027	PAINTER PHOTOGRAPHER FILMMAKER VIDEO ARTIST WHATEVER YOU DO
YOU1000000187_S0000029	NOBODY ELSE CAN DO THAT BETTER THAN
YOU1000000187_S0000031	I THINK YOU KNOW THE THING IS IS WE'RE NOT YOU KNOW WE CAN'T IMPART ANY KIND OF WISDOM TO ANYONE ELSE WE'RE SO IMMERSED IN THE BULLSHIT OF OUR OWN ACTIVITIES TO
YOU1000000187_S0000032	TO KNOW EVEN HOW TO GIVE ANYONE ADVICE SO
YOU1000000187_S0000034	MY ADVICE TO YOUNGER ARTISTS WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE
YOU1000000187_S0000036	TO BE VERY SENSITIVE TO WHERE THEY ARE IN WHAT TIMES IN WHAT PART OF THE WORLD AND HOW THAT
YOU1000000187_S0000038	CONSTITUTES THE ARTISTIC PRACTICE THE ARTISTIC INQUIRY
YOU1000000187_S0000040	I THINK THE GREAT ARTISTS HAVE TO BE READY TO FAIL WHICH IS NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE DO BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE SUCCESS
YOU1000000187_S0000041	IN A CERTAIN WAY THEN THE PUBLIC ACCEPT YOU IN A CERTAIN WAY YOU START SOMEHOW INVOLUNTARY REPRODUCING THE SAME IMAGES THE SAME TYPE OF WORK
YOU1000000187_S0000042	AND YOU'RE NOT RISKING AND THE REAL ARTISTS YOU KNOW ALWAYS CHANGE THEIR TERRITORIES AND THEY GO TO THE LAND THEY'VE NEVER BEEN AND THERE
YOU1000000187_S0000043	IS UNKNOWN TERRITORY AND THEN YOU CAN FAIL AND YOU CAN RISK AND THAT FAILURE ACTUALLY IS WHAT MAKES THIS THIS EXTRA
YOU1000000187_S0000044	YOU KNOW READY TO FAIL THAT MAKES GREAT ARTISTS
YOU1000000187_S0000046	IT'S NOT THAT THERE ISN'T THINGS TO SAY TO ARTISTS BUT UNLESS THEY ARE THE SPECIFIC THINGS THEY'RE GOING TO HEAR IT'S
YOU1000000187_S0000048	NOT WORTH THEIR WHILE LISTENING OR YOU'RE WORTH YOUR WHILE TELLING THEM SO I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH THE SPECIFIC INTERACTION OF THE PERSON GIVING THE ADVICE AND THE PERSON RECEIVING IT RATHER THAN
YOU1000000187_S0000049	BROAD NOSTRILS WORK HARD
YOU1000000187_S0000051	YOUR BEST DO WHAT YOU LIKE AND PEOPLE WILL RESPECT YOU FOR IT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT SUBJECT YOU TAKE ON IN THE END WHATEVER YOU DO IS GOING TO BE A SELF PORTRAIT IT WILL REVEAL WHO YOU ARE
YOU1000000187_S0000052	IF IT'S ARROGANT IT'S ABOUT YOU IF IT'S PRETENTIOUS THAT'S ABOUT YOU DON'T THINK YOU CAN ESCAPE YOURSELF BY YOUR CHOICE OF SUBJECT MATTER
YOU1000000187_S0000053	THERE ARE MANY THINGS LIKE THAT THAT ONE CAN SAY BUT UNLESS SOMEONE IS NEEDING THOSE WORDS
YOU1000000187_S0000055	THEY DON'T GET HEARD
YOU1000000187_S0000056	MAKE YOUR OWN WAY IN THE WORLD

YOU1000000187_S0000059	
YOU1000000187_S0000061	A VERY OLD PROFESSOR REALLY WHICH I LOVE VERY MUCH AND HE GAVE ME TWO ADVICES HE SAID TO ME IF YOU ARE DRAWING WITH YOUR RIGHT HAND
YOU1000000187_S0000062	AND YOU'RE GETTING BETTER AND BETTER AND BECOME VIRTUES SO THAT CLOSED EYES
YOU1000000187_S0000064	YOU CAN DRAW ANYTHING YOU WANT IMMEDIATELY CHANGE TO THE LEFT HAND AND THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT ADVICE BECAUSE BECAUSE WHEN YOU BECOME ROUTINE THAT IS THE END OF EVERYTHING
YOU1000000187_S0000065	AND THE SECOND GREAT ADVICE I SAY TO ME YOU KNOW IN YOUR LIFETIME YOU PROBABLY WILL HAVE ONE GOOD IDEA IF YOU'RE REALLY GOOD ARTIST
YOU1000000187_S0000066	AND IF YOU'RE GENIUS TO GOOD IDEAS THAT'S IT BUT BE CAREFUL WITH THEM
YOU1000000187_S0000067	DON'T DO ANYTHING THAT SOMEBODY ELSE THAT YOU KNOW DEEP IN YOUR HEART SOMEBODY ELSE CAN DO BETTER BUT DO WHAT NOBODY ELSE CAN DO EXCEPT FOR YOU
YOU1000000187_S0000069	WHAT I THINK THE BEST ADVICE IS IS I THINK WORKING WITH ART IS WORKING WITH SOMETHING THAT IS VERY FIERCE VERY STRONG VERY ROBUST
YOU1000000187_S0000071	
YOU1000000187_S0000073	EVEN THOUGH THE WHOLE WORLD SEEMS TO SAY THAT ART IS FRAGILE SHOULD BE MARGINALIZED IT'S NOT IMPORTANT IT'S COUNTERPRODUCTIVE IT'S
YOU1000000187_S0000074	YOU KNOW DOESN'T BELONG TO THE CENTER OF WHAT WHAT REALITY IS DEFINED AS ARTISTS SHOULD HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE FACT THAT WHILE MAKING
YOU1000000187_S0000076	DRAWING ON A PIECE OF PAPER IS CHANGING THE WORLD
YOU1000000187_S0000078	BY DEFINITION MAKING ART IS MAKING THE WORLD SO IT IS AN UNBELIEVABLY REWARDING THING TO BE AN ARTIST
YOU1000000187_S0000079	AND TO BE FULLY BEHIND THAT IDEA AS A YOUNG ARTIST AND TO ACTUALLY SEE THAT HAVING CHOSEN THE IN MANY PERSPECTIVES STRANGE CHOICE TO BECOME AN ART
YOU1000000187_S0000080	IS ALSO TO HAVE CHOSEN TO BE A PART OF THE WORLD
YOU1000000187_S0000081	TO BE TO BE AN ARTIST ACTUALLY TO BE A HUMAN BEING IN THESE TIMES IT'S ALL DIFFICULT YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH LIFE HOPEFULLY

YOU1000000187_S0000084	OR MAYBE WHAT YOU WANT IS TO WRITE SCRIPTS FOR DETECTIVE SHOWS IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER YOU KNOW WHAT MATTERS IS TO BE IS TO KNOW WHAT YOU WANT
YOU1000000187_S0000085	AND PURSUE IT AND UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S GOING TO BE HARD BECAUSE LIFE IS REALLY DIFFICULT

YOU1000000189_S0000055	I DON'T KNOW HOW I HAVEN'T EATEN VEGETABLES THIS FRESH BEFORE AND I FEEL LIKE EVERYONE NEEDS TO LIKE I BUY EXPENSIVE FREAKING SPINNAGE AT THE STORE
YOU1000000189_S0000056	ALL ORGANIC EVERYTHING WHOLE PAYCHECK WHOLE BOOT IT HAPPENS BUT IT DOESN'T TASTE LIKE THIS
YOU1000000189_S0000057	THEY GROW MOST SPINACH IN SAND SO A LOT OF TIMES WHEN YOU CRUNCH ON SPINACH
YOU1000000189_S0000058	YOU GO LIKE GRANITO
YOU1000000189_S0000059	THAT'S THE SAND THAT THEY GROW IT IN SO YOU ALWAYS WANT TO RINSE IT WELL AND GET RID OF THAT
YOU1000000189_S0000060	ONE OF THE CRAZIEST THINGS I TRIED WAS THE TEA LEAF
YOU1000000189_S0000061	TRY JUST A PIECE OF THIS IS JUST A REALLY SMALL AMOUNT
YOU1000000189_S0000065	WHAT IS THAT
YOU1000000189_S0000066	NATURAL PLANT SWEETENER
YOU1000000189_S0000067	I JUST WANT TO EAT THIS AS LIKE AN AFTER DINNER DESSERT AND THEN I WILL NEVER EAT ICE CREAM AGAIN
YOU1000000189_S0000068	I MEAN THAT'S SO SWEET ISN'T
YOU1000000189_S0000069	YEAH I HAVE HAD THE STEVIA POWDER BUT NEVER A STEVIA LEAF OH THAT IS
YOU1000000189_S0000070	THE ACTUAL STEVE PLANT HERE
YOU1000000189_S0000071	WOW THAT'S AMAZING YOU CAN USE IT IN SO MANY THINGS AND IT IS SO POWERFUL I ALSO TRIED A MINT CHOCOLATE HERB
YOU1000000189_S0000072	AND IT TASTED JUST LIKE MINT CHOCOLATE
YOU1000000189_S0000073	SO ONCE WE HAVE A SPROUT WE PUT IT IN THE TOWER TWENTY SIX DAYS LATER YOU HAVE THAT THINGS GROW THIS THING
YOU1000000189_S0000074	TWENTY SIX DAYS
YOU1000000189_S0000075	
YOU1000000189_S0000077	SO WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU GET ACCELERATED GROWTH BECAUSE THE ROOTS CAN GET A LOT OF OXYGEN
YOU1000000189_S0000079	SINCE THERE'S NO SOIL THERE'S NO WEEDS WHICH IS AMAZING BECAUSE POOLING WEEDS IS LITERALLY THE WORST WEEKEND ACTIVITY EVER
YOU1000000189_S0000080	VERTICAL FARMING IT'S JUST YOUR HEAD OF LETTUCE OR YOUR PAL OR YOUR SPINACH OR YOUR BERRIES OR YOUR TOMATOES NO BUGS NO WEEDS
YOU1000000189_S0000081	WHAT IS THE ACTUAL BENEFIT OF HAVING A VERTICAL FARM VERSUS HAVING A NORMAL FARM THAT WE'RE USED TO
YOU1000000189_S0000082	BIG PART OF IT IS WITH THE VERTICAL FARM WE'RE REALLY SAVING ON SPACE WE CAN USE NINETY PERCENT LESS LAND BUT WE CAN GROW NINETY PERCENT MORE FOOD
YOU1000000189_S0000083	WHEN YOU GO VERTICAL LIKE THIS THIS IS ONE TENTH OF AN ACRE WE CAN GROW TEN TIMES MORE FOOD AS A RESULT OF GOING VERTICAL
YOU1000000189_S0000084	PLUS OUR RESOURCES WE USE NINETY TO NINETY EIGHT PERCENT LESS WATER THAT'S HUGE YEAH I MEAN WHAT THREE PERCENT OF THE WATER IN THE IN THE WORLD IS FRESH WATER
YOU1000000189_S0000085	SO IT'S NOT JUST A COMMODITY HERE IN THE UNITED STATES BUT ALL OVER THE WORLD HAVING FRESH WATER SO WE GOTTA REALLY CONSERVE OUR RESOURCES AND IF WE DON'T
YOU1000000189_S0000086	WE'RE SETTING OURSELVES UP FOR MAJOR CATASTROPHE
YOU1000000189_S0000087	HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU THINK YOU COULD FEED LIKE JUST OUT OF THIS SPACE
YOU1000000189_S0000088	OUT OF THIS SPACE WE COULD EASILY SPEED GOSH HUNDRED FAMILIES ON A WEEKLY BASIS
YOU1000000189_S0000089	WOW AS WE ALL KNOW OUR WORLD IS CHANGING THE LAND AVAILABLE TO US IS CHANGING THE QUALITY SOIL THAT WE HAVE ON OUR EARTH IS CHANGING
YOU1000000189_S0000090	AND THIS MAY BE THE MOST SUSTAINABLE WAY TO FEED OUR COMMUNITIES MOVING FORWARD IF SOMEONE WATCHED THIS VIDEO AND WANTED TO START GARDENING TOMORROW OR TODAY
YOU1000000189_S0000091	WHAT WOULD BE LIKE YOUR TOP THREE TIPS FOR DOING THAT
YOU1000000189_S0000092	GROW THE THINGS YOU LOVE TO EAT KEEP IT SIMPLE USE CLEAN WATER USE GOOD QUALITY SEEDLINGS WE'VE GOT RESIDENTIAL MODELS
YOU1000000189_S0000093	AS WELL AS COMMERCIAL FARMS
YOU1000000189_S0000094	DENTAL MODEL
YOU1000000189_S0000095	SO THE RESIDENTIAL MODELS ABOUT FIVE OR SIX FEET TALL JUST LIKE YOU ARE AND ONE TO TWO TOWERS COULD EASILY FEED A FAMILY OF FOUR DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU'RE GROWING
YOU1000000189_S0000096	YOU'RE GONNA BE EXPOSED TO LESS CHEMICALS YOU'LL LOVE IT YOU REALLY LOVE IT
YOU1000000189_S0000097	I WAS A SKEPTIC I ABSOLUTELY THOUGHT THE BIOLOGY OF THIS FOOD MUST BE DIFFERENT IF WE'RE NOT MAKING IT WITH SOIL AND THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER
YOU1000000189_S0000098	THE SAME AMOUNT OF SUNLIGHT AS THE VEGETABLES AND FRUITS WERE USED TO BUT THE MATTER OF THE FACT IS IT'S BETTER IT'S GOT MORE NUTRIENTS MORE MINERALS
YOU1000000189_S0000099	IT'S MORE DENSE IN THE RICH VITAMINS THAT YOUR BODY NEEDS AND IT'S JUST MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY
YOU1000000189_S0000100	YOU KNOW AS A COMPOUND PHARMACIST I DO CONSULTS AND I GOT INTO THIS BECAUSE I REALLY SAW NOT JUST MY OWN KIDS BUT MY OWN PATIENTS THAT WERE MISSING THE FOOD PART
YOU1000000189_S0000101	THEY WERE MISSING THAT NUTRITION PART AND AS I CORRECTED NUTRITION IN THEM I'M LIKE THIS CHANGED THEIR WHOLE LIFE
YOU1000000189_S0000102	YOU WERE TAUGHT IN PHARMACY SCHOOL JUST GIVE A DRUG GIVE A DRUG GIVE A DRUG DRUGS ARE JUST MANDATES THEY DON'T CURE US IF IF YOU DON'T HAVE GOOD NUTRITION
YOU1000000189_S0000103	THAT FOUNDATION THAT WE'RE BUILDING OUR BODY ON ISN'T THERE AND SO THAT LEADS TO ALL SORTS OF THINGS YOU KNOW DEPRESSION LEAKY GUT GUM DISEASE
YOU1000000189_S0000104	PEOPLE THAT ARE CONSTANTLY HAVING HEADACHES THEY'RE NOT GROWING PROPERLY OUR KIDS DON'T GROW PROPERLY BECAUSE OF NUTRITION SO IT STARTS WITH GOOD FOUNDATION
YOU1000000189_S0000105	IF YOU HAVE A GOOD GOOD FOUNDATION WITH NUTRITION EAT IT WHICH YOU GROW OR BUY IT LOCALLY YOU'RE GONNA BE WAY HEALTHIER
YOU1000000189_S0000106	CRAZY HOW YOUR DIET CAN AFFECT PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING IT'S HARD TO PUT INTO A SENTENCE HOW COOL AND INTERESTING I THOUGHT THIS WHOLE EXPERIENCE WAS
YOU1000000189_S0000107	I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A FIRM BELIEVER IN WHAT YOU PUT IN YOUR BODY MATTERS AND THE FOOD YOU PUT IN YOUR BODY MATTERS
YOU1000000189_S0000108	AND WE ARE ALLOWING FOOD INDUSTRIES TO SPRAY IT WITH PESTICIDES TO TRANSPORT IT SUPER FAR CHANGE ITS ENZYMES AND NUTRITIONAL BENEFITS
YOU1000000189_S0000109	SO THAT WHEN WE'RE RECEIVING THE FOOD IT'S NOT EVEN GIVING US THE FUEL THAT WE NEED TO SURVIVE IN A HEALTHY WAY
YOU1000000189_S0000110	THE BODY IS AN INCREDIBLE PIECE OF EQUIPMENT MACHINERY YOU PUT GOOD STUFF IN IT GIVES GOOD STUFF OUT IF YOU PUT BAD STUFF IN IN TIME BAD STUFF'S GONNA COME OUT
YOU1000000189_S0000111	BUT YOU CAN CORRECT IT IT JUST TAKES SOME SOME EFFORT ON OUR PART TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT WHO SAID THAT HIPPOCRATES YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT LET FOOD BE MEDICINE LET MEDICINE BE FOOD
YOU1000000189_S0000112	HE SAID IT A LOT MORE ELOQUENTLY BUT I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT
YOU1000000189_S0000113	TRUE GARDEN WAS QUITE POSSIBLY ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THINGS I'VE EVER SEEN I WAS PRISTINE IT WAS GREEN
YOU1000000189_S0000114	NOT FAKE GREEN NOT SPRAYED ON GREEN IT WAS BEAUTIFUL VIBRANT GREEN
YOU1000000189_S0000115	AND THE OXYGEN IN THAT GREEN HOUSE I WOULD LIKE TO ONE DAY LIVE IN A GREENHOUSE WITH THAT PURE OXYGEN
YOU1000000189_S0000116	I'M REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN ABOUT MY HEALTH TO LEARN ABOUT MY FOOD AND ALSO TO SHARE THE INFORMATION WITH YOU GUYS
YOU1000000189_S0000118	IN HOPES THAT IT MAYBE CHANGES ONE THING YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE EVERYTHING OVERNIGHT DO ONE THING THAT WILL MAKE YOU BETTER TOMORROW THAN YOU ARE TODAY
