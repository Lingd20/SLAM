POD1000000004_S0000000	hey friends i do not know about you but when i was a kid i knew absolutely nothing about money well there is a new show from marketplace and brainson that will help address just that
POD1000000004_S0000001	10 brazilian is a new podcast for kids and their families it is all about money how it works how we use it where it comes from and how we could all get a little bit smarter about it but in a fun way
POD1000000004_S0000002	10 brazilian helping dollars make more sense this podcast is presented in partnership with green light the debit card for kids listen and subscribe wherever you get your podcasts
POD1000000004_S0000003	lela green is a trauma surgeon in houston
POD1000000004_S0000004	i meet people on the worst day of their life usually
POD1000000004_S0000005	well then i guess i should be glad we did not meet in real life before lela could become doctor green she had to do a whole lot of training
POD1000000004_S0000006	and you know it is really hard to do when you are working a banker is number of hours eat properly
POD1000000004_S0000007	i was in general surgery residency at the time and kind of tired of eating like hospital food or fast food and things
POD1000000004_S0000008	and that is when she heard about this service a meal kit delivery that would send her all the ingredients she would need to make 3 full meals plus instructions on how to make them no more time consuming trips to the grocery store and no more desperation big mac
POD1000000004_S0000009	so i said well i will try and i got a free box and so i said okay i can do this and i live by myself so i thought it would just be something fun to do
POD1000000004_S0000010	what green is conveniently leaving out of her story is her level of cooking experience pre meal kit
POD1000000004_S0000011	i can heat things up
POD1000000004_S0000013	like
POD1000000004_S0000014	i had to buy so many different things like once these boxes started coming you need all these like equipment and things that i did not have had to buy esters
POD1000000004_S0000015	and like i did not have a garlic press what is this okay but you know i am a surgeon so i have to have all the right instruments
POD1000000004_S0000017	you know to put this stuff together
POD1000000004_S0000018	getting a meal kit every week did force green to upgrade her kitchen utensils game but more importantly it gave her back time something that as a trauma surgeon she does not take for granted
POD1000000004_S0000019	plus the meal kits help green hone her cooking skills forget just pressing cook on the microwave green is now a master in the fine art of man place
POD1000000004_S0000020	you know you have to learn how to like chop everything up and set it aside and
POD1000000004_S0000021	right
POD1000000004_S0000022	you know you really do have to feel like you are cooking things because you really do have to put everything together
POD1000000004_S0000023	right now i would think if you were a surgeon your knife skills would be too bad
POD1000000004_S0000024	no i mean i can i can cut people and carts okay i can you know
POD1000000004_S0000025	in the year that green subscribed to that meal kit delivery service she made seared steak and pizza from scratch and a whole host of other things she would never normally prepare for herself and she documented her cooking journey on instagram
POD1000000004_S0000026	but eventually green finished her training and got back to a more regular schedule which allowed for grocery shopping and meal prep so she canceled her subscription
POD1000000004_S0000027	which was bad news for the meal kit service she was using blue apron you may be familiar with the company from such podcasts as all of them

POD1000000004_S0000041	when blue apron began in 2012 it was supposed to revolutionize how americans ate it was going to gently pull us away from our takeout and our tv dinners and nudge us back into the kitchen and for a while it worked until it did not
POD1000000004_S0000042	and americans return to the warm embrace of their box mac and cheese and take out patai obviously a home cooking revolution did not materialize
POD1000000004_S0000043	or did it the novel coronavirus has forced many of us to become intimately acquainted with our casserole dishes and our garlic presses and our dutch ovens
POD1000000004_S0000044	we made banana bread by the palate and sour dough starter by the ton we learned how to sear steak and spatchcocked chickens and all manner of gruesome carnivorous techniques in short boy did we ever cook
POD1000000004_S0000045	all this cooking at home created a make or break moment for blue apron but it was not supposed to be like that just a few years ago the company was valued at $20 now it was barely hanging on by its fingernails
POD1000000004_S0000046	it is only lifeline a global health crisis that required so many of us to shelter in place for months and avoid trips to the grocery store
POD1000000004_S0000047	i am lauren over from american public media welcome to the new season of spectacular failures the show that always lube is the hell out of failure
POD1000000004_S0000049	legend has it that the idea for blue apron began with an argentinian stake there were these 2 guys matt salberg and lippes and they were clever tech entrepreneur types
POD1000000004_S0000050	full of ideas salberg had an mba from harvard and cut his teeth in a big new york venture capital firm pappas was a go getter software engineer they met at a network happy hour and decided to go into business together
POD1000000004_S0000051	but what kind of business
POD1000000004_S0000052	their original idea is not meal kits it is more of a research crowdfunding idea called petri dish
POD1000000004_S0000053	that is alex conrad he is a senior editor at forbes he wrote about the founders in 2015 petri dish was not the par is only startup idea
POD1000000004_S0000054	i think another one we highlighted in our article was warby parker for strollers
POD1000000004_S0000055	do not even understand
POD1000000004_S0000057	a high end but also affordable stroller experience yeah
POD1000000004_S0000058	so those 2 startup ideas a kickstarter for science experiments and warby parker for strollers were nonstarters for the pair but then over grilled meat it hit them
POD1000000004_S0000059	salberg and papas are doing dinner and they are struggling to make argentinian stakes on a borrowed grill
POD1000000004_S0000060	and they are like you know would not it be great if there is a service basically for amateurs like us
POD1000000004_S0000061	in fact there was but it was in sweden in 2007 a woman named kiki tender created a company called
POD1000000004_S0000062	david that translates into dinner piece in english
POD1000000004_S0000063	let me see if i can pronounce this right medar
POD1000000004_S0000064	that is pretty good
POD1000000004_S0000065	tender wanted to solve the vexing nightly problem that families around the world face what are we having for dinner because the answer can not always be ice cream
POD1000000004_S0000066	people started talking about hell hour you know like the hour between 5 and 6 when you have to run to the grocery store and and fight with your spouse about who is cooking tonight what are we having
POD1000000004_S0000067	that right there is the spirit of entrepreneurship
POD1000000004_S0000068	i think the question is then is this a legitimately huge problem and is this a problem that a lot of people have as well
POD1000000004_S0000069	for salberg and papas the answer to both of those questions was an enthusiastic yes now at this point it was 2012 and tinder is company had been around for 5 years and was growing steadily
POD1000000004_S0000070	it had a few competitors in europe but in the us nothing of the sort existed which was great for salzberg and papas
POD1000000004_S0000071	and so they think hey we can start our own meal kit company for the u s market called part and parsley
POD1000000004_S0000072	to be clear that is a terrible name and very quickly they changed it to blue apron named for what french apprentice chefs wear in the kitchen
POD1000000004_S0000073	at almost the exact same time a harvard classmate of salsburg began a rival meal kit company called plated but salsburg and popes were not worried because they had brought on a ringer
POD1000000004_S0000074	matt attack a chef with a degree from the prestigious culinary institute of america and watch was the guy that was going to make their business stand apart from its rivals
POD1000000004_S0000075	wodak would basically go and source the ingredients farmers would say okay we would love to lock in these large extra orders
POD1000000004_S0000076	at a scale that is very attractive to us you know many 1000s of ingredients i think you know when he was in his food world that was a differentiator and great for blue apron
POD1000000004_S0000077	not only did teach design the menus and source the products but he also served as the social media face of the company he was blue apron is culinary secret weapon and did a series of early youtube videos showcasing his know how
POD1000000004_S0000078	here he is trying to convince us that artichokes are not vile
POD1000000004_S0000079	everybody likes artichokes but they are crazy what do you do with them they are tough they are spiny they are all over the place they are kind of confusing a lot of times people just do not cook them because they do not understand how to cook them
POD1000000004_S0000081	cuts into some truly revolting artichokes and proceeds to make my worst dining nightmare
POD1000000004_S0000082	get in there with a spoon and scoop out that really hairy choky interior and the reason why they call it the choke is because if you eat this you are going to choke it is full of little fibers and it is like a fish bone
POD1000000004_S0000083	in the early days all the founders had to hustle like this before they had staff it was salsburg papas and wadas packing up boxes in a small kitchen in long island city new york
POD1000000004_S0000084	then seemingly out of nowhere the company landed some sweet venture capital to the tune of $30 things were looking good for the startup
POD1000000004_S0000085	within the 1st few years the business took off in 2014 blue apron was shipping 60 meals a month by 2016 it was 80 meals and a $10 in revenue
POD1000000004_S0000086	within just 5 years of its founding the company employed 4500 people and was valued at nearly $20 blue apron looked like it was on the express train to success ville
POD1000000004_S0000087	pran seemed to be sort of the buzziest the biggest market share the leader in this emerging category
POD1000000004_S0000088	which included hello fresh sun basket and about a 10 companies with the word chef in the name
POD1000000004_S0000089	then i actually tried the product and it seemed at least to me personally just as someone testing the products that blue apron overall kind of had the experience that resonated the most with me and i thought might resonate the most with americans
POD1000000004_S0000090	now the thing about americans is
POD1000000004_S0000091	we love products that claim to make our lives easier more convenient less of a hassle and that is exactly what blue apron was doing it was saying hey working mom we know you have a lot on your plate lol
POD1000000004_S0000092	we want to help you cook nutritious and delicious meals for your family without the hassle of going to the grocery store or reading a cookbook
POD1000000004_S0000093	but it was also saying hey millennial we know you are work hard play hard eat sloppy take out at 9 pm kind of person but we also know that you would love to cook if only it was not such a time consuming pain in the ass
POD1000000004_S0000094	so we are going to make it super convenient for you
POD1000000004_S0000096	this american obsession with convenience around food and in particular the magical home cooked meal minus the effort goes back to at least the late 19th century says culinary historian laura shapiro
POD1000000004_S0000097	that was when a particular brand of utopian fiction began to emerge
POD1000000004_S0000098	the plot was sort of the same somebody is taking a walk they get banged on the head when they wake up it is 500 years in the future and they are surrounded by all these strange looking creatures and it is a whole different world
POD1000000004_S0000099	and somebody takes them to dinner they take them home to dinner and it is a miracle dinner
POD1000000004_S0000100	the food just appeared with the press of a button or the wave of an arm and it was scrumptious and filling and most importantly back then digestible
POD1000000004_S0000101	miracle food it was utopian food and that has been a dream i think that has attached itself to the american dinner table for decades and decades
POD1000000004_S0000102	not long after the emergence of this utopian fiction dining actually did start to look like a miracle you could buy vegetables in a can and chicken in a can and later full meals like spaghetti and meatballs in a can
POD1000000004_S0000103	then in the 1950 s came the frozen turkey dinner just wait in the oven and presto a rubbery simulacrum of the real thing but it was quick and cleanup was a breeze
POD1000000004_S0000104	mother murphy lucky me my wife uses swanson tv turkey dinners and make your husband lucky to get swanson tv turkey dinners swanson tv fried chicken dinners
POD1000000004_S0000105	swanson tv beef dinners from your grocer is big freeze
POD1000000004_S0000106	when frozen fish sticks hit the scene around the same time buddy it was utopian fiction come to life
POD1000000004_S0000107	master chad morley at missus paul is fish sticks with his fingers
POD1000000004_S0000108	now i am 32 and i use a fork sometimes
POD1000000004_S0000109	missus paul is fish sticks you never stop loving him
POD1000000004_S0000110	it was an immediate success these you know deep fried frozen fish sticks that tasted not at all of fish which meant that people adored them
POD1000000004_S0000111	obviously fish sticks took off and the industry used that as an excuse to stickify everything chicken eggplant lima beans whatever you could deep fry and freeze the packaged food industry tried it
POD1000000004_S0000112	the post war years also brought an explosion of fast food and takeout meal and now in the 21st century we can order just about any food we want from some vegan drumsticks to a prefix cuisine meal just by pressing an app
POD1000000004_S0000113	all of these iterations of the miracle dinner it is like they aim at 3 longings that women have always had when they think about making dinner they wanted to be effortless
POD1000000004_S0000114	they wanted to be delicious and they wanted to have the moral value of home cooking
POD1000000004_S0000115	the home cooking aspect of this is perhaps the most resonant
POD1000000004_S0000116	the thing that home cooking delivers that none of these other things do is that it satisfies i think what we all feel as the moral imperative to cook
POD1000000004_S0000117	there is something that just does not click in when the thing comes in from outside
POD1000000004_S0000118	and this is a great thing for a company like blue apron because
POD1000000004_S0000119	blue apron inches a little closer to that it just it gets you that much closer to feeling as though you have cooked this
POD1000000004_S0000120	notice shapiro said feeling as though you cooked something because for her what blue apron is doing despite all of its fresh ingredients and chef inspired recipes is helping you assemble
POD1000000004_S0000121	they kind of fool you into thinking you are cooking whereas real cooking hands on cooking knowledgeable cooking has to do with cooking day after day
POD1000000004_S0000122	does not mean you are making fabulous elaborate meals day after day even if it is the simplest possible thing that is cooking
POD1000000004_S0000123	sure getting a dime bag of tatar a thimbleful of pepitas and a literal tablespoon of sesame oil in your meal kit does have a somewhat infantilizing effect
POD1000000004_S0000124	but in blue apron is early years plenty of people were happy to have everything portioned out for them but convincing potential customers that they wanted and needed a service like that that cost the company some big cash
POD1000000004_S0000125	in the form of free meals tons of specials and endless advertising anyone who listened to podcasts in 2015 through 2018 is bound to have heard at least one disinterested podcast host give a lackluster blue apron ad read
POD1000000004_S0000127	in bespeak all of this is known as the cac or customer acquisition cost
POD1000000004_S0000128	what it is supposed to be is the total amount of money that the company spent
POD1000000004_S0000129	on marketing to acquire customers divided by the number of customers that they actually acquired
POD1000000004_S0000130	that is dan mccarthy he is a marketing professor at emory university is business school and he is studied blue apron for years mccarthy says that in the early days blue apron was spending about $6070 per customer
POD1000000004_S0000131	but then as people came and went blue apron had to spend more and more money to get new customers on board the customer acquisition cost just kept creeping up and up and up until it nearly doubled
POD1000000004_S0000132	and you can imagine if you are spending a 120 just to bring somebody in when you talk about the amount of profit that you need after that to break even on that customer that is a tougher proposition
POD1000000004_S0000133	the more money blue apron spent the harder it was to recoup the investment which brings us to the 2nd problem preventing customers from bolting once the company has spent all that money to bring them in
POD1000000004_S0000134	how many customers stick around is measured by a really important metric called churn rate the churn rate tells you the rate at which customers come into and spin out of the business
POD1000000004_S0000135	if you are spending a lot of cash to land new customers and they do not stick around long enough to make any money off them you have high customer acquisition costs and a high churn rate
POD1000000004_S0000136	that is where blue apron found itself and even the most basic cooking dodo could tell you that is a gourmet recipe for losing a lot of money
POD1000000004_S0000137	our pal doctor green used blue apron for about a year which is way longer than most of its customers stuck around
POD1000000004_S0000138	yes about half the people were churning out in a month by 6 months about 70% of their customers were churning out they just were not were not able to keep those customers for as long as they they should
POD1000000004_S0000139	despite blue apron is early success and growth one nut the company has never been able to crack is how to stop that outflow how do you get people to subscribe and stay subscribed at least long enough to make a profit off of them it is a puzzle
POD1000000004_S0000140	but despite its high churn rate blue apron was still the market leader it had gotten a slight jump start on rival hello fresh and was starting to look real sexy to big investors
POD1000000004_S0000141	they were the £800 gorillas and even though the space itself was not that that large at the time it was still something like $50 and growing really quickly
POD1000000004_S0000142	on its face business seemed booming but the whole meal kit market was on the cusp of a shake up
POD1000000004_S0000143	in 2017 grocery chains albertsons and roger each picked off competing meal kick companies then another blue apron rival she abruptly shut down and laid off all its employees only to be bought a week later
POD1000000004_S0000144	and so blue apron was at a crossroads says alex conrad
POD1000000004_S0000145	for startups the most common exits are you know you fail you go public or you get bought those are really the only traditional outcomes and so for the companies that did not want to fail they were going to have to go public someday or sell
POD1000000004_S0000146	like that that is that is just the reality
POD1000000004_S0000147	so blue apron had 3 choices pack it in sell or go public we are going to take a quick break when we come back join me in my outdated condo kitchen as i whip up some delicious blue apron meals
POD1000000004_S0000148	and we explain how the really terrible coronavirus was also a little bit good for blue apron plus we gaze into our meal kit crystal ball to see what the future might hold spoiler the future is delicious

POD1000000004_S0000166	no story about blue apron could be called complete without sampling the product so i ordered up a box and paid for it mind you
POD1000000004_S0000167	okay so i just got my blue apron box at my doorstep and when i picked it up i could not believe how heavy it was
POD1000000004_S0000168	when the box arrived it felt like christmas except better because the food was not mediocre and arranged in a shrink wrap basket
POD1000000004_S0000169	so let us crack into this box
POD1000000004_S0000170	inside there were 2 bunches of kale some loose onions and about a 10 tiny bags of knickknacks including 2 tablespoons of cream fresh a quarter of a cup of pancho bread crumbs and one teaspoon of something called for cocke
POD1000000004_S0000171	which according to the blue apron recipe was supposed to lend even more savory flavor to my dish
POD1000000004_S0000173	there is the tiniest the tiniest tiniest portion of brown rice i mean this must be maybe half a cup in a bag maybe 3 times the size
POD1000000004_S0000174	i decided that it would be sad to cook these dishes by myself so i invited my girlfriend over to experience the magic of blue apron with me
POD1000000004_S0000175	you have a choice between meals tonight
POD1000000004_S0000176	i am so ready mostly because i am so hungry
POD1000000004_S0000177	0 well we had the choice of 3 dishes but one of them had cilantro sauce so no thank you another was like a spicy indian situation and i was feeling kind of basic so i chose the past and cal pasta with goat cheese
POD1000000004_S0000178	it says this quick cooking pasta gets a 12 punch of irresistible flavor from a dollop of creamy goat cheese for delicious tang and our bacus basil pesto stirred into the warm pasta and garlicky cal just before serving
POD1000000004_S0000179	by the way that was run on
POD1000000004_S0000180	herbaceous
POD1000000004_S0000181	a touch of crushed red pepper
POD1000000004_S0000182	technically we pick the easiest dish so what things were going well until i dropped a garlic clove down the incinerator
POD1000000004_S0000183	no the garbage disposal
POD1000000004_S0000184	after that near catastrophe we boiled the fresh catelli sauteed the kale with garlic and red pepper flakes added the pesta and the dollop of goat cheese and all
POD1000000004_S0000185	can i get you a bowl of pasta
POD1000000004_S0000186	
POD1000000004_S0000187	you could
POD1000000004_S0000188	and i am here to report we made a damn fine meal the cal was tender crisp and very well seasoned the cave tally was perfectly elegant well done hannah and the cheese added some good saltiness
POD1000000004_S0000189	i would say we are perfectly satisfied diners but wait there is more
POD1000000004_S0000190	cleanup is practically nothing because everything came out of a packet so really we are only left with
POD1000000004_S0000191	actually that is really nice
POD1000000004_S0000192	a couple of dishes
POD1000000004_S0000193	i want to underestimate that i think that is really nice
POD1000000004_S0000194	but not everyone who is used blue apron has appreciated that the company has gotten flak for its abundant packaging though much of it is now recyclable and customers have complained that the recipes were too complicated
POD1000000004_S0000195	i made 4 blue apron meals for the story and for a middling cook with a reasonable amount of cookware i thought the dishes were pretty simple to assemble also pretty tasty
POD1000000004_S0000196	i would make every single one of those dishes again but i do the shopping myself which i guess sort of defeats the purpose
POD1000000004_S0000197	when i opened my 1st blue apron box it was a novelty a cornucopia and cardboard but then i forgot to cancel my subscription and i got a 2nd box by accident
POD1000000004_S0000198	that one was not as exciting by then i understood the gimmick and the excitement of discovery kind of fizzled in this way i am not too different from a lot of people who try blue apron says professor dan mccarthy
POD1000000004_S0000199	discovery does not tend to last that long there is a bunch of people they look at blue apron as this it is like i want kind of this surprise and delight every month
POD1000000004_S0000200	the problem is they may want that initially but after you have been surprised and delighted a few times you said you know i am pretty good i do not need any more of this surprise and delight
POD1000000004_S0000201	but blue apron execs were like 0 yeah you do you need it and you want it and they believed in their product is ability not just to continually delight but to actually provide a valuable service to people
POD1000000004_S0000202	and all that meant that in 2017 the company had to work out its options pack it in sell or go public
POD1000000004_S0000203	and the higher ups decided on going public
POD1000000004_S0000204	now before offering up public stock in the company for the 1st time blue apron wanted to show strong customer growth so they started to amp up spending to bring in new users
POD1000000004_S0000205	remember the customer acquisition cost in the year before the ipo blue apron increased its marketing cash by almost 200%
POD1000000004_S0000206	but none of this marketing resulted in a huge new customer hall and that says forbes is alex conrad made investors a little less in love with the company
POD1000000004_S0000207	it was hard to make a really attractive you know future facing story for like how blue apron really becomes that huge
POD1000000004_S0000208	blue apron books were not the only thing that made investors turn up their noses around the ipo a couple weeks before the blue apron team was set to ring the bell the new york stock exchange amazon made a little announcement
POD1000000004_S0000209	it was buying whole foods in a $1370 deal for blue apron it was like getting upstage at your own wedding by an impossibly rich and infinitely more beautiful guest of a guest
POD1000000004_S0000210	when amazon is acquisition of whole foods was announced that was just devastating even just psychologically it felt like you know here come the giants
POD1000000004_S0000211	and if amazon can sell things online really well and whole foods has pretty good ingredients what is blue apron really selling here
POD1000000004_S0000212	and then of course amazon trademarked its own meal kit offering
POD1000000004_S0000213	everyone was very concerned that basically this was going to be the next i will not call blue apron an ant you know but i would say everyone agree amazon is way bigger
POD1000000004_S0000215	they were just going to bowl their way right in and and stamp this this industry out and so that that was a big lurking concern
POD1000000004_S0000216	blue apron ipo in the summer of 2017 raised $30 about a 3rd of what the company anticipated stock went for about $10 a share rather than the expected 15 to $17
POD1000000004_S0000217	it was a turbulent ipo to say the least
POD1000000004_S0000218	still blue apron co founder and ceo matt salberg seemed pretty upbeat about the whole situation on cnbc
POD1000000004_S0000219	i am honestly not here to really talk about the pricing of blue apron stock that is really up to the investors to decide you know blue apron is here because we are excited about the big opportunity that we are going after
POD1000000004_S0000220	tackling a huge market and we are focused on the long term quite frankly and the stock price today whether it is up down left or right is really just the beginning of this new chapter in our company is life that we are really excited
POD1000000004_S0000222	one thing salberg mentioned in that clip was how his company was tackling a huge market now if you are defining the market as all the people who eat food in america then yeah that is a huge market
POD1000000004_S0000223	but according to the good folks at market research company packaged facts that market has a ceiling and not like a cathedral ceiling
POD1000000004_S0000224	initially the market was definitely expanding exponentially and i think that is where a lot of the interest initially came from if you are seeing these companies that are having a 100% growth like that is really significant
POD1000000004_S0000225	that is tara brach she is a food and beverage analyst with package facts
POD1000000004_S0000226	one of the whole things that i think went wrong with the industry is people thought there was a very big addressable market for meal kits but as it turns out there really is not
POD1000000004_S0000227	it is hard to gauge but rash estimates that only about one of the us population uses home delivery meal kits and she says the market kind of peaked 2 or 3 years ago
POD1000000004_S0000228	since blue apron started more than 150 meal kit services have come on the scene but only about 15 to 20 are national operations with hellofresh now the clear market leader
POD1000000004_S0000229	remember when we said amazon trademarked its meal kit back in 2017 rash says the company never did much with it and that is a pretty good indicator that meal kit delivery is not a growing global concern
POD1000000004_S0000230	i think that amazon saw that much of the market for meal kits had already been addressed by the competitors that were already there so they did not try really to break into that because they did not see much potential for growth anymore
POD1000000004_S0000231	it seems like amazon was right to hold off in 2017 blue apron emerged 250000 customers and its stock price had tanked just $2.99 a share by the end of the year
POD1000000004_S0000232	and there were more problems within a month of the ipo co founder matt had stepped down as ceo matt salberg then the ceo resigned his post shortly thereafter
POD1000000004_S0000233	blue apron is expensive brand spanking new fulfillment center in new jersey had a bunch of tech bugs that needed to be worked out and workers from its california operation filed a class action lawsuit over alleged missing wages
POD1000000004_S0000234	things were looking pretty grim for the once hyped company
POD1000000004_S0000235	welcome to trading nation i am eric chummy let us take a look at one of last year is high profile ipos that is getting absolutely smoked we are talking of course about blue apron the stock sinking as much as 4% on friday
POD1000000004_S0000236	by the end of 2018 blue apron stock dipped below a dollar a share and the slide did not seem to be letting up
POD1000000004_S0000237	the following summer the company tried to move meant to keep it from being booted from the stock exchange it is called reverse stock
POD1000000004_S0000238	lit and basically it means that the company bundled its shares so you get fewer total number of shares but each share is worth more like trading in 4 quarters for a dollar
POD1000000004_S0000239	the move raised the company is stock price but customers still were not flocking to blue apron boxes now at this point i would have thrown in the towel but not ceo linda finley koslowski
POD1000000004_S0000240	the company would not make koslowski available for chat but here she is last year on cnbc is squawk on the street talking about how jazz she is about blue apron is prospects
POD1000000004_S0000241	our recipes our ingredients our culinary authority our brand recognition is by far still number one so we feel confident that when we are talking to investors they appreciate and understand that there is something here it is really just about getting execution right and making sure that we are actually
POD1000000004_S0000242	cool cool but also blue apron was thinking about getting down with some strategic alternatives says market watches tony garcia
POD1000000004_S0000243	strategic alternatives which you know means a lot and and nothing at the same time right
POD1000000004_S0000244	it is like saying i am totally happy being single but i would be into dating if the right person came along
POD1000000004_S0000245	it is kind of like one of those things that companies will say when they are just like well we would be open to you know getting bought or a partnership if you are interested you know kind of thing
POD1000000004_S0000246	in early 2020 blue apron put the word out that i was interested in possibly getting scooped up maybe by a big grocery chain or someone else with deep pockets who wanted to own a meal kit delivery business
POD1000000004_S0000247	at the same time garcia says the company acted like it was in turnaround mode it decided to streamline operations including shutting down its fulfillment center in texas
POD1000000004_S0000248	it also did away with trying to shovel everyone who had ever eaten food into the top of its customer funnel
POD1000000004_S0000249	they have decided to focus on what they call their core customers and these are people who are not going to do like a lot of people and use a coupon and you know get blue apron for a month and then cancel their subscription
POD1000000004_S0000250	so at the same time blue apron was looking to sell it was also doubling down on its mission these were last gasp effort it wanted to save itself
POD1000000004_S0000251	and then came the most unlikely lifeline anyone could think of a global pandemic a highly contagious virus that required those of us without essential jobs to practically never leave our houses
POD1000000004_S0000252	online grocery delivery shot through the roof and suddenly everyone remembered about this company they heard about on a podcast at 3 years ago
POD1000000004_S0000253	the pandemic has been actually a bit of a good thing for them because it has raised demand
POD1000000004_S0000254	blue apron sees a lot of potential in what the company is offering especially given that more americans seem to be interested in cooking at home thanks corona
POD1000000004_S0000255	if you are blue apron then you are probably thinking you know well if we do a good job some of this will stick
POD1000000004_S0000256	in the 1st quarter of 2020 when coronavirus brought america to a standstill blue apron customer orders were up a bit though they did not spike like the markets hoped the company still lost $20 but that was a little better than the previous quarter
POD1000000004_S0000257	on its 1st quarter earnings call of 2020 the company is ceo and co shook their pompoms like they were on an episode of cheer but like the version that features slightly wooden corporate executives
POD1000000004_S0000258	i think the combination of those things you know puts us in a good position going forward and and you know we can not specifically guide to what is going to happen in the 2nd half of the year because of all the uncertainties
POD1000000004_S0000259	you know we do believe that they will continue to be some positive effects as we move out of 2
POD1000000004_S0000260	the pandemic seems like it is given blue apron a decent little boost in the 2nd quarter the company brought in 20000 more subscribers but that is still way below where they were in 2019
POD1000000004_S0000261	it is anyone is guess whether blue apron specifically and meal kit delivery more generally are here to stay the business kiki tender founded in sweden 13 years ago still delivering weekly meal fixins to buy swedes
POD1000000004_S0000262	and despite its own turbulence market leader hellofresh is still cranking out boxes and there is no shortage of small meal kit companies looking to fill paleo or vegan or regional cuisine niches
POD1000000004_S0000263	no one knows what the true impact of a global pandemic will be on how we eat and where and when not yet anyway grocery delivery seems like it is here to stay
POD1000000004_S0000264	maybe high end restaurant takeout will also stick around in some form it is hard to tell whether all those people who took up home cooking out of necessity will continue to bake crusty sourdough and whip up elaborate curries when we can all safely frequent our favorite local spots
POD1000000004_S0000265	blue apron is banking on a sea change in how americans eat the company that was shopping for a buyer just a month before the pandemic hit is now trying to turn a cataclysmic global event into a business saving opportunity

POD1000000010_S0000002	and it changed the whole focus of her life
POD1000000010_S0000003	there are only 2 kinds of people in the world good people and good people in pain
POD1000000010_S0000004	her name is scarlett lewis and before we met her cory i have to confess that i was not necessarily all that impressed with kindness as an idea i mean
POD1000000010_S0000005	you are a kindness skeptic
POD1000000010_S0000006	well i do not want to say skeptic but just let us say that kindness is like a slogan that is on a pillow that i would never have on my couch
POD1000000010_S0000007	but that really really changed for me when we traveled to rural connecticut to spend some time with scarlet
POD1000000010_S0000009	i have lived on this farm for 20 years before the 2 boys and it is really my dream place
POD1000000010_S0000010	scarlett named this place wild rose farm there are a few chickens clucking in a wire coop behind a muddy pasture where there is also a horse
POD1000000010_S0000011	this is one of the oldest barns in fairfield county
POD1000000010_S0000012	
POD1000000010_S0000013	yeah the house is 1740 so older than the united states of america
POD1000000010_S0000014	we get there in time to watch her feed the animals including her constant companions 3 dogs remmington rocky and olive
POD1000000010_S0000015	
POD1000000010_S0000016	i think he thought that the mike was a dog watch out
POD1000000010_S0000017	so scarlet leads us inside the house and i remember we took our jackets off in the mud room and hanging there was a 1st graders black and blue sky jacket
POD1000000010_S0000018	and scarlett stopped and she pulled out a pair of these funny looking teeth out of the pocket joke teeth
POD1000000010_S0000019	i always say that he wore these little teeth because he was such a goofball to school every day
POD1000000010_S0000020	little silver teeth
POD1000000010_S0000021	
POD1000000010_S0000022	
POD1000000010_S0000023	scarlett is son jesse had these teeth in this coat at sandy hook elementary school the day he died
POD1000000010_S0000024	my name is scarlett lewis and i am the founder of the jesse lewis choose love movement
POD1000000010_S0000025	and i founded this organization following the murder of my 6 year old son alongside 19 of his classmates and 6 educators in one of the worst mass murders in u s history
POD1000000010_S0000026	here in sandy hook connecticut in 2012 scarlet lived through every parent is nightmare
POD1000000010_S0000027	and following that i realized that there is not a day out there
POD1000000010_S0000028	and by they she means someone else who is going to come into our schools and our homes and help kids replace their anger and violence with warmth and compassion
POD1000000010_S0000029	right then we come into the sunny kitchen which is painted turquoise and bright yellow
POD1000000010_S0000030	every surface is covered with paintings scarlet done and photos of jesse and his brother j t
POD1000000010_S0000031	and one of the cabinets has chalkboard paint on it and on it is a message from jesse
POD1000000010_S0000032	we we hardly ever use this is spray painted chalkboard
POD1000000010_S0000033	scarlett did not notice this message until she returned to the house several days after the shooting to find clothes for jesse to wear in his casket
POD1000000010_S0000034	she walked in and froze
POD1000000010_S0000035	i saw that nurturing healing love and i could not believe it
POD1000000010_S0000036	nurturing healing love you can see those 3 words they are spelled phonetically in a 6 year old jagged scroll
POD1000000010_S0000037	i thought i would never be able to come back here i do not know why i am crying because usually i do not sorry
POD1000000010_S0000038	i am usually really good at keeping it together give me a moment
POD1000000010_S0000040	scarlet says she has no idea how or where her little boy came up with those 3 words
POD1000000010_S0000041	but the moment she saw them she realized
POD1000000010_S0000042	this is my life now i knew i would be spending the rest of my life spreading this message
POD1000000010_S0000043	and by the way 6 years later you can tell what a moment it was because it is all i talk about it is all i do
POD1000000010_S0000044	is the focus of my life every waking moment every breath every word that comes out of my mouth is about nurturing healing love really
POD1000000010_S0000046	you are listening to npr is life kit for parenting with sesame workshop

POD1000000010_S0000059	so cory yes kindness is important but i guess i always assume that my kids would learn it naturally through osmosis
POD1000000010_S0000060	just if you love them they will become kind
POD1000000010_S0000061	well you know what anya you are not alone in that assumption
POD1000000010_S0000062	we often just expect people to be kind without talking about it
POD1000000010_S0000063	we think 0 you are a good kid you are going to be kind
POD1000000010_S0000064	that is jennifer cotler she is one of our expert guides today through what turns out to be a pretty complicated subject
POD1000000010_S0000065	kindness has been a part of sesame street from the beginning so it is not a new concept but
POD1000000010_S0000066	but she says the folks at sesame and lots of child development experts are starting to notice things warnings
POD1000000010_S0000067	not only in the headlines but in research
POD1000000010_S0000068	and that brings us to our 1st takeaway that parents and teachers are sending kids really mixed messages about kindness
POD1000000010_S0000069	exhibit a is the study jen points to out of harvard a few years back
POD1000000010_S0000070	middle school children for example thought that their parents valued academic success over kindness
POD1000000010_S0000071	in fact about 80% of children believed their parents were more concerned about good grades and their kids careers than whether they were caring towards others
POD1000000010_S0000072	80% and the parents on the other hand they got surveyed too
POD1000000010_S0000073	and they did not realize this they they were totally wrong about the message that they thought their kids were getting
POD1000000010_S0000074	yeah and this kind of like self delusion this is just one of many reasons scarlet worries that this culture is creating huge problems
POD1000000010_S0000075	now at epidemic levels
POD1000000010_S0000076	and i am not talking about just school violence and bullying and loneliness but also substance abuse and mental illness
POD1000000010_S0000077	and of course her life is a really stark reminder core of just how high the stakes can be when we talk about things like mental health and kids who are troubled
POD1000000010_S0000078	sometimes it is frustrating for me because we act like we do not know what to do
POD1000000010_S0000079	and we do know what to do
POD1000000010_S0000080	after she read that message from jesse scarlett lewis reached out to a team of researchers and educators and she created a plan to essentially teach children kindness step by step value by value
POD1000000010_S0000081	yeah the jesse lewis choose love enrichment program they estimate it is now reached over a 10 students
POD1000000010_S0000082	in fact in the past decade or so schools all over the country have woken up to the idea that they have a responsibility to teach kids how to treat each other
POD1000000010_S0000083	yeah and not just to prevent the next tragedy but also because research tells us that these non academic skills often called social and emotional skills
POD1000000010_S0000084	they make up about half of the equation that determines whether kids are going to be successful in their lives
POD1000000010_S0000085	so let us follow scarlett is lead and sesame street and talk about how the science of kindness can translate into action
POD1000000010_S0000087	takeaway number 2
POD1000000010_S0000088	kids are born to be kind
POD1000000010_S0000089	but also unkind
POD1000000010_S0000090	here is what we mean
POD1000000010_S0000091	so on the one hand people have neurons in our brains called neuro neurons and they respond in the same way when we experience pain like we are pricked by a needle as we do when we watch someone else experience pain
POD1000000010_S0000092	it is a mirror
POD1000000010_S0000093	it lights up the same receptors in our brain as physical pain
POD1000000010_S0000094	soon after birth children for example will be more likely to cry as a result of hearing another child cry than they are in response to any other sort of noise
POD1000000010_S0000095	thomas lacana says we see signs of what is called empathic distress even in tiny babies
POD1000000010_S0000096	he is a psychologist who wrote the book on how to raise kind kids literally
POD1000000010_S0000097	that is what it is called he is also been a family counselor has 2 kids and 15 grandkids
POD1000000010_S0000098	and tom told us that baby is moral sense seems to go even deeper
POD1000000010_S0000099	studies going back to the late 1990 s have found infants as young as 3 months old prefer a kind or helper puppet over a mean aggressive character
POD1000000010_S0000100	so this is like i was saying core i always thought kids are just born to be kind
POD1000000010_S0000101	yeah but the problem for kids is that there are also a lot of barriers to kindness
POD1000000010_S0000102	for example there is a small study of 2 year olds who were exposed to another child is distress say a friend fell down on the playground
POD1000000010_S0000103	only about a 3rd of the kids actually responded in that moment with altruism with kindness by say going over to the child offering a hug calling for an adult
POD1000000010_S0000104	
POD1000000010_S0000106	to tell he is trying to trick on you
POD1000000010_S0000107	he is trying to help you
POD1000000010_S0000108	yeah and we actually saw this kind of scene in person on a recent trip that we took to a preschool on the campus of eastern connecticut state university
POD1000000010_S0000109	galileo
POD1000000010_S0000110	great let us see
POD1000000010_S0000111	what a kind friend
POD1000000010_S0000112	0 yeah
POD1000000010_S0000114	and it really got me wondering would my kids be that one in 3 would yours
POD1000000010_S0000115	yeah i do not know i mean i really hope so
POD1000000010_S0000116	but what is it that gets in the way of that kindness that act of kindness in the moment
POD1000000010_S0000117	a bunch of things
POD1000000010_S0000118	young kids are naturally self centered
POD1000000010_S0000119	
POD1000000010_S0000120	every parent knows that
POD1000000010_S0000121	so they might just be oblivious to another child is pain
POD1000000010_S0000122	you know and there is also individual temperament
POD1000000010_S0000123	so some kids
POD1000000010_S0000124	they really can not handle other kids pain they they shut down
POD1000000010_S0000125	or maybe they are really shy and they are waiting for someone else to step up
POD1000000010_S0000126	you know decades of psychology research tells us this is a grown up problem too
POD1000000010_S0000127	sometimes the presence of others automatically serves as an inhibition
POD1000000010_S0000128	but there is also another more disturbing barrier to kindness that adults really need to understand here and it is prejudice
POD1000000010_S0000129	so there is another yale study of 6 to 8 month old babies
POD1000000010_S0000130	
POD1000000010_S0000131	they wanted a puppet that did not share their snack preference punished
POD1000000010_S0000132	punished
POD1000000010_S0000133	yeah so it is not just that these babies showed a preference for those who look or behave or think like they do but also a kind of hostility to those that do not
POD1000000010_S0000134	wow
POD1000000010_S0000135	yeah so for all these reasons children and grown ups alike do not always reach out to help
POD1000000010_S0000136	instead we often do the opposite
POD1000000010_S0000137	it is true we hide from other people is pain we run away from responsibility
POD1000000010_S0000138	and that is why scarlet says
POD1000000010_S0000139	you do not really need the skills and tools
POD1000000010_S0000140	what you need is the courage to be with somebody in pain and just be present
POD1000000010_S0000142	and that is our 3rd takeaway
POD1000000010_S0000143	kindness requires courage
POD1000000010_S0000144	the jesse lewis choose love program for kids from pre k through high school actually begins with courage
POD1000000010_S0000145	and i want to mention that reports of the shooting said that jesse himself showed incredible courage
POD1000000010_S0000146	when the shooter stopped to reload he yelled run and the investigator said that he saved many of his classmates lives in that moment
POD1000000010_S0000147	yeah and scarlett is definition of courage is even bigger than that sort of
POD1000000010_S0000149	courage
POD1000000010_S0000151	heroic courage
POD1000000010_S0000152	for her it includes the courage to reach out to a hurting friend on the playground or a child you do not even know
POD1000000010_S0000153	yeah absolutely i mean the courage to offer comfort to someone who is lost a loved one even if the idea of death is really scary to you
POD1000000010_S0000154	it is also scarlet says the courage to stand up to someone who is bullying you or someone you know by taking their perspective and seeing the world through their eyes
POD1000000010_S0000155	gosh you know what would make you act that way
POD1000000010_S0000156	what is going on in your life
POD1000000010_S0000157	i feel compassion for you
POD1000000010_S0000158	i see the pain
POD1000000010_S0000159	is there anything that i can do to help ease that pain
POD1000000010_S0000160	you know hearing about courage in that way in that moment really spoke to me cry because i have to admit this
POD1000000010_S0000161	i was a little afraid to sit down with scarlet
POD1000000010_S0000162	i mean someone who had gone through something that i as a parent fear so much and to look that pain in the face
POD1000000010_S0000163	but the way that she has transformed that experience into a positive legacy is is so inspiring
POD1000000010_S0000165	one really practical way scarlett is choose love plan builds courage is by teaching kids to stay calm
POD1000000010_S0000166	they practice brave poses and brave breaths to stand up tall like superheroes and calm down their bodies and their minds
POD1000000010_S0000167	yeah there are a few different reasons for this which make up our 4th takeaway
POD1000000010_S0000168	yeah takeaway number 4
POD1000000010_S0000169	kindness takes mindfulness
POD1000000010_S0000170	jen cotler at sesame says if you are more aware of your emotions you will also be more aware of everyone else is
POD1000000010_S0000171	and you will be less likely to lash out violently in frustration or anger
POD1000000010_S0000172	self regulation is something we all struggle with
POD1000000010_S0000173	and that is why mindfulness is so important and really learning how to manage our own emotions
POD1000000010_S0000174	and i think the earlier that we can practice those skills the better we will be in adulthood
POD1000000010_S0000175	in fact the folks at sesame are so convinced of the connection between mindfulness and kindness that they like to use a special word mindfulness
POD1000000010_S0000176	you hear that miriam webster
POD1000000010_S0000178	anyway lots of these social and emotional learning programs introduce tools like meditation relaxation yoga to help kids work on this body mind connection
POD1000000010_S0000179	so we talked about the courage that it takes to step in when someone else is hurting even if that person is being hurtful towards you
POD1000000010_S0000180	and how to cultivate that quiet in your mind that lets you do that
POD1000000010_S0000181	our next takeaway is about what to do when your child hurts someone else accidentally or intentionally
POD1000000010_S0000182	or on the other hand when someone else hurts your child
POD1000000010_S0000183	takeaway number 5
POD1000000010_S0000184	apologies are a skill
POD1000000010_S0000185	and forgiveness is a gift you give yourself
POD1000000010_S0000186	yeah before jen started at sesame workshop she spent her days in a classroom
POD1000000010_S0000187	i remember when i was a preschool teacher briefly that we were told we do not force children to apologize to each other
POD1000000010_S0000188	and i remember in my early 20 s thinking that is absurd
POD1000000010_S0000189	you should totally tell children to apologize to each other
POD1000000010_S0000190	the problem jen found out with forced apologies is that they are usually pretty worthless
POD1000000010_S0000191	sorry
POD1000000010_S0000192	they do not even realize that that they are supposed to mean it or feel it
POD1000000010_S0000193	yeah so tom lacana and jen cotler both told us instead of focusing on kids parenting the words sorry
POD1000000010_S0000194	we should help them really take the other person is perspective and this is important repair the harm done
POD1000000010_S0000195	yeah and this is a great tip
POD1000000010_S0000196	jen says you can actually take a moment like this
POD1000000010_S0000197	and direct one child to look at the other child is face and posture
POD1000000010_S0000198	this helps them learn how to read feelings
POD1000000010_S0000199	so it is really about more conversations and about looking at emotions and emotion knowledge and looking at faces to see how your actions affect other people
POD1000000010_S0000200	jen says sesame street has improved over time in how it depicts apologies on the show
POD1000000010_S0000201	it now has characters discuss what went wrong and why and how to make it better
POD1000000010_S0000202	so elmo might say i was really wanting to play with my scooter and i did not want to share it
POD1000000010_S0000203	and i realized that you probably wanted to turn to
POD1000000010_S0000204	and i should let you have the time with it
POD1000000010_S0000206	got it so
POD1000000010_S0000207	but wait what about your turn
POD1000000010_S0000208	can be patient and wait for his turn
POD1000000010_S0000209	what do you say so
POD1000000010_S0000210	and then the other character would say yes that is how i was feeling that you were not sharing
POD1000000010_S0000211	and it was hurting my feelings and then when you shared it made me feel better
POD1000000010_S0000212	
POD1000000010_S0000214	nice job sharing
POD1000000010_S0000215	
POD1000000010_S0000216	so in that interaction you are giving children a lot of language to describe how they are feeling
POD1000000010_S0000217	that may be a lot to expect from a 2 year old
POD1000000010_S0000218	but you know apologies are a skill kind of like learning to scooter
POD1000000010_S0000219	and they improve with practice
POD1000000010_S0000220	yeah and starting these kinds of conversations early is crucial to raising a child who runs to help when somebody is hurt
POD1000000010_S0000221	so remember that small study we mentioned of kids on the playground
POD1000000010_S0000222	well it also looked in depth at the parenting styles of their mothers in different situations
POD1000000010_S0000223	when one child heard another many of the mothers responded with something casual and bland
POD1000000010_S0000224	yeah like 0 do not do that
POD1000000010_S0000225	but the researchers found that the moms of the helper kids those one and 3 who ran to help they were different
POD1000000010_S0000226	yeah they were warm and nurturing but they also took it really seriously when their child hurt another child
POD1000000010_S0000227	so they would say something like
POD1000000010_S0000228	you hurt amy
POD1000000010_S0000229	pulling hair hurts never pull hair
POD1000000010_S0000230	and as a result the child was more likely to take it seriously later on and respond compassionately when she saw another child crying on the playground
POD1000000010_S0000231	tom also says that children should learn to make an apology of action
POD1000000010_S0000232	what we grown ups might call restitution if you break something you fix it whether it is a broken toy or hurt feeling
POD1000000010_S0000233	this is also where things get hard for us grown ups too
POD1000000010_S0000234	
POD1000000010_S0000235	because all the experts we spoke with were really clear kids do what they see
POD1000000010_S0000236	and scarlet lewis says that means when parents grew up we need to apologize too
POD1000000010_S0000237	wow mom made a mistake you know
POD1000000010_S0000238	i misinterpreted what just happened here
POD1000000010_S0000239	i got angry i am sorry you know can you guys forgive me
POD1000000010_S0000240	if anything scarlet talks even more about the other side of an apology forgiveness
POD1000000010_S0000241	that is one of the 4 core values of her choose love program along with courage
POD1000000010_S0000242	she says when she 1st pitched the program people were not sure about forgiveness
POD1000000010_S0000243	that is a very lofty topic for kids
POD1000000010_S0000244	do not you think that is a little too complicated
POD1000000010_S0000245	not at all she says
POD1000000010_S0000246	the chose love classrooms have turned forgiveness into a hands on exercise
POD1000000010_S0000247	we literally take string and scissors and we cut the cord because that is how i talk about it
POD1000000010_S0000248	like if you are angry at somebody you are attached to them with an umbilical cord
POD1000000010_S0000249	and it runs out of your side into the side of the person that you are angry at
POD1000000010_S0000250	i love this too because scarlett is really focusing on the benefit of letting go of anger
POD1000000010_S0000251	and she says you know holding onto anger it can be as bad for your health as smoking cigarettes
POD1000000010_S0000252	and it was at this point we are sitting with scarlet in her kitchen her back is to refrigerator which is covered with photos of jessie and her other son j t and we just had to ask
POD1000000010_S0000253	we have been talking about forgiveness
POD1000000010_S0000254	did she forgive the person who murdered her son
POD1000000010_S0000255	absolutely
POD1000000010_S0000257	without hesitation yeah without hesitation i absolutely forgive him
POD1000000010_S0000259	so we have been talking about kindness in the darkest hours those moments of conflict
POD1000000010_S0000260	loss and pain hurt and anger
POD1000000010_S0000261	and those are really important
POD1000000010_S0000262	i mean that is when you really need kindness
POD1000000010_S0000263	yeah but how do you build kindness up
POD1000000010_S0000264	well if you want to really grow kind people there is a lot you can do when things are good when you are full of joy
POD1000000010_S0000265	that is our takeaway number 6 kindness grows with sunlight
POD1000000010_S0000266	what do we mean by that
POD1000000010_S0000267	you have to raise the capital of kindness
POD1000000010_S0000268	as simmons help run the social and emotional programs for schools in oakland california
POD1000000010_S0000269	and she focused a lot on kindness when she taught elementary school
POD1000000010_S0000270	you have to point it out
POD1000000010_S0000271	you have to name it
POD1000000010_S0000272	you have to appreciate it when you see it
POD1000000010_S0000273	for example every day she would hold circle time
POD1000000010_S0000274	and a lot of times she would ask this
POD1000000010_S0000275	you know what were some ways this week where your classmates were kind to you
POD1000000010_S0000276	turn and share a moment where you felt someone was being really kind
POD1000000010_S0000277	tom lakona says it is not just about celebrating kind actions
POD1000000010_S0000278	it is encouraging kids to identify as kind people
POD1000000010_S0000279	yeah because people are more likely to be kind if they see it as part of who they are
POD1000000010_S0000280	yeah this idea of taking special notice when people are kind to you well another word for that could be gratitude
POD1000000010_S0000281	yeah part of how scarlet keeps going she told us is by constantly reminding herself even out loud what she is grateful for
POD1000000010_S0000282	my gratitude lists are all day long
POD1000000010_S0000283	and i start in the morning by ticking off up the sun is out and up i can get up out of bed and literally like i am taking them off all day
POD1000000010_S0000284	and when you are focused on gratitude you are not focused on the lesser energy thoughts
POD1000000010_S0000285	and tom agrees
POD1000000010_S0000286	here is a payoff to practicing gratitude in this way
POD1000000010_S0000287	not only can it raise the stock of kindness in your family in your classroom but research shows that people who are thankful are also happier
POD1000000010_S0000288	yeah he suggests that at meal times for example families go around and mention their grateful things that they are thankful for that day
POD1000000010_S0000289	yeah we do this in my house
POD1000000010_S0000291	who wants to go 1st
POD1000000010_S0000292	i am thankful for animals and pandas
POD1000000010_S0000293	thank you for this food and this day and at my concerts today
POD1000000010_S0000294	it is not always easy
POD1000000010_S0000295	sometimes my guys do not really want to do it they just want to eat
POD1000000010_S0000296	thank you for this breakfast
POD1000000010_S0000297	
POD1000000010_S0000298	but we do it
POD1000000010_S0000299	the point of all this is to really carve out a time in each day for your kids and you to acknowledge you know we are not self sufficient
POD1000000010_S0000300	we are not island
POD1000000010_S0000301	we need other people and other people need us
POD1000000010_S0000302	that is a great point core i have got to try that
POD1000000010_S0000304	we have come to our final takeaway takeaway number 7 kindness requires
POD1000000010_S0000305	practice practice practice
POD1000000010_S0000306	yeah in fact scarlet lewis says
POD1000000010_S0000307	we were going to change the name of our program from choose love enrichment program to choose love enrichment practice
POD1000000010_S0000308	and similarly tom says kindness as a virtue is not random it is a habit
POD1000000010_S0000309	and that is not just calling out kindness when you see it in your kids
POD1000000010_S0000310	it is giving them lots of opportunities to be kind you know
POD1000000010_S0000311	you can start with chores at home
POD1000000010_S0000312	sure yeah that is a really good idea
POD1000000010_S0000313	so tom says you know not for an allowance but just to give the message that this is what we do to help out because we are part of something bigger
POD1000000010_S0000314	and for my daughter lulu who is 7 that chore really is taking care of the cat
POD1000000010_S0000315	you know when we got the cat she promised that she would help out not only with the feeding but also the litter box
POD1000000010_S0000316	this is really giving her the message that there is another creature depending on her
POD1000000010_S0000317	yeah totally
POD1000000010_S0000318	and you can also and should you know take this model this idea and take it out into your community
POD1000000010_S0000319	have your kids help pick up trash in the neighborhood or help folks at a shelter
POD1000000010_S0000320	raise money for a good cause whatever it is
POD1000000010_S0000322	and here is really good news tom told us
POD1000000010_S0000323	getting our kids to be helpers to be in service it does not just benefit the grown ups that they become
POD1000000010_S0000324	doing this regularly actually feels good chemically
POD1000000010_S0000325	it is what brain researchers call helpers high
POD1000000010_S0000326	doing a kind act lights up a part of the brain that lets us experience joy
POD1000000010_S0000327	and that is why he says we are happier when we are helping and janet sesame agrees
POD1000000010_S0000328	kindness really does make you feel good
POD1000000010_S0000329	and that is why scarlet says we should talk to kids directly about this helper is high
POD1000000010_S0000330	there is so much science that shows and i say all the nurturing healing love that you give out you get back
POD1000000010_S0000331	so this is getting me thinking more about that study of middle school students that we opened the episode with
POD1000000010_S0000332	
POD1000000010_S0000333	you know our kids they hear from us every day do your homework
POD1000000010_S0000334	study for the test
POD1000000010_S0000335	how well did you do
POD1000000010_S0000336	and they hear us talk about sweating some promotion or working hard on a project
POD1000000010_S0000337	but you know do we ever stop and ask them were you kind in class today
POD1000000010_S0000338	yeah did you help somebody who is hurting or sit by that kid who always eat alone
POD1000000010_S0000339	it is no wonder our kids so often think that we value grades more than kindness
POD1000000010_S0000340	so i am thinking more about how to raise the capital of kindness
POD1000000010_S0000341	and we have gone through these great strategies right
POD1000000010_S0000342	yeah yeah i mean the the goal here everyone we talked to said this said this
POD1000000010_S0000343	they use the word culture
POD1000000010_S0000344	you have to create a culture of kindness whether you are talking about home or the classroom or any
POD1000000010_S0000346	time for a recap anya
POD1000000010_S0000347	all right i am feeling the love let us do it
POD1000000010_S0000348	
POD1000000010_S0000349	here we go takeaway number one
POD1000000010_S0000350	we grown ups need to stop sending our kids mixed messages about kindness
POD1000000010_S0000351	yeah we say we want our kids to be kind but we have got to walk the walk
POD1000000010_S0000352	takeaway number 2 kids are born to be kind but also unkind
POD1000000010_S0000353	yes so empathy is part of what makes us human but and this is a big but
POD1000000010_S0000354	there is a difference between feeling someone else is pain and actually acting to help
POD1000000010_S0000355	yeah kindness is not just a feeling it is an action
POD1000000010_S0000356	and that is why our takeaway number 3 is kindness requires courage
POD1000000010_S0000357	the courage to embrace other people is pain the courage to put other people is needs before your own
POD1000000010_S0000358	but also courage to see someone who is hurt you or a friend or someone in your family not as a bully
POD1000000010_S0000359	but as someone who is struggling
POD1000000010_S0000360	the kind of courage to see the world the way scarlet louis does
POD1000000010_S0000361	there are only 2 kinds of people in the world good people and good people in pain
POD1000000010_S0000362	takeaway number 4 to build kindness practice mindfulness
POD1000000010_S0000363	being able to stay calm and patient will help you every time
POD1000000010_S0000364	especially when someone hurts you
POD1000000010_S0000365	so takeaway number 5 is apologies are a skill and forgiveness is a gift you give yourself
POD1000000010_S0000366	remember parents and teachers alike the old singsongy sorry it is not good enough
POD1000000010_S0000367	and when you are on the other side of the harm forgiveness may feel hard but it will also feel good in the long run
POD1000000010_S0000368	speaking of feeling good our takeaway number 6 is kindness grows with sunlight
POD1000000010_S0000369	or as jen at sesame says
POD1000000010_S0000370	we often are quick to tell children when they are doing something wrong and trying to correct them from doing something wrong
POD1000000010_S0000371	instead can we spend more time catching them doing something right catching them doing something kind
POD1000000010_S0000372	so create a culture of kindness and gratitude recognition of kindness in your home and in your classroom
POD1000000010_S0000373	and takeaway number 6 kindness takes practice
POD1000000010_S0000374	and grown ups can help with that by creating opportunities for your kids to be kind
POD1000000010_S0000375	whether that is chores at home or family service projects out in the community
POD1000000010_S0000377	and that is all for this episode of life kit for parenting with sesame workshop

POD1000000014_S0000011	peter you are extremely welcome thank you for being with us
POD1000000014_S0000012	thank you rob very glad to be here
POD1000000014_S0000013	peter i am very interested to hear a bit about your early life
POD1000000014_S0000014	where were you born and tell us a bit about the values that were instilled in you when you grew up
POD1000000014_S0000015	thank you rob i was born in dublin i was born into a fairly ordinary working class home
POD1000000014_S0000016	my dad was a mechanic with the state transport company my mother was as was the case with many in the day a housewife
POD1000000014_S0000017	we lived a very ordinary family life
POD1000000014_S0000018	i did not enjoy school i was taught by the christian brothers so i have some of my learning to thank them for
POD1000000014_S0000019	i would not say they contributed to a very happy school days but the rest of my childhood was very enjoyable so
POD1000000014_S0000020	my mother would have been quite religious it was a very different ireland at the time
POD1000000014_S0000021	our house was busy there were often relatives or neighbors popping in for cups of tea
POD1000000014_S0000022	and so it was a pleasant place to grow up
POD1000000014_S0000023	so you had a community service background before going to work in local government that is correct is not it
POD1000000014_S0000024	yes i worked for the welsh housing agency when it was set up that was funding housing associations on special needs housing
POD1000000014_S0000025	but then i went to work for cardi housing department
POD1000000014_S0000026	i was responsible for services like homelessness and sheltered housing for older people and so on
POD1000000014_S0000027	and also manage the gypsy sites in cardi so very interesting job
POD1000000014_S0000028	but i gradually became more involved in mainstream housing through that
POD1000000014_S0000029	and then before you became welsh ombudsman you were you were chief executive of the arts council of wales was that good fun
POD1000000014_S0000030	it was very good fun it was at a time shortly after the creation of the welsh assembly
POD1000000014_S0000031	government in wales was interested in nation building if you like doing things to bring people together and they saw the arts as a valuable way of doing that
POD1000000014_S0000032	from my perspective obviously i was also interested in community arts and arts outreach to people who are otherwise excluded
POD1000000014_S0000033	so it fitted very well for me i never had any expertise in the arts but i greatly enjoyed it
POD1000000014_S0000034	and it was a very good time for the arts in wales
POD1000000014_S0000035	i think you must be one of the very few people to have occupied national ombudsman jobs in more than one country
POD1000000014_S0000036	i do not know whether there is anyone else like you in that regard but what was it like moving from being ombudsman in wales to ombudsman in in ireland
POD1000000014_S0000037	it was interesting
POD1000000014_S0000038	i think the ombudsman in wales was a very significant player in the evolution of the devolved administration in wales
POD1000000014_S0000039	but particularly the work focused within the health sphere
POD1000000014_S0000040	and an awful lot of the complaints that we dealt with were to do with clinical judgment
POD1000000014_S0000041	so moving to ireland and firstly i found that i do not have jurisdiction over clinical judgment
POD1000000014_S0000042	but also have jurisdiction over a much broader range of government services and local government
POD1000000014_S0000043	so it was similar in some ways to wales but it was a bigger job if you like
POD1000000014_S0000044	in the context of a whole national government and a different set of issues to deal with
POD1000000014_S0000045	in ireland you are also you wear many hats you are also the information commissioner
POD1000000014_S0000046	and you deal with local government standards as well
POD1000000014_S0000047	is that you find that an advantage in terms of being ombudsman
POD1000000014_S0000048	it is very helpful if you are committed to the same kinds of principles you are committed to good public services you are committed to openness you are committed to transparency
POD1000000014_S0000049	those values work across all of the different hats i wear
POD1000000014_S0000050	i suppose the biggest difference is as ombudsman you make recommendations but in ireland in the history of the office they have always been implemented
POD1000000014_S0000051	as information commissioner you make binding decisions but those get challenged in the courts
POD1000000014_S0000052	despite what many people think to be the case being an ombudsman in some ways is more effective in terms of having outcomes achieved than having binding powers as information commissioner
POD1000000014_S0000053	what would you say have been the biggest challenges to you as irish ombudsman
POD1000000014_S0000054	you have obviously successfully dealt with them because you have been reappointed for a 2nd term but looking back on the 6 years that you have had what are the biggest challenges
POD1000000014_S0000055	the biggest challenge we face was with the investigation into the magdalin laundries
POD1000000014_S0000056	as we looked more closely at the issues there this was about women who had been held against their will
POD1000000014_S0000057	often young women who would had babies sometimes school children had been held against their will and forced to work for many years in laundries
POD1000000014_S0000058	what i was looking at was a government compensation scheme and the department of justice had chosen to interpret that scheme very narrowly
POD1000000014_S0000059	so they were excluding young women people who at the time were young women and had worked in the laundries but been detained in industrial schools
POD1000000014_S0000060	shared the same sites as the laundries but not technically resident in the laundry
POD1000000014_S0000061	so we looked at that felt that there was a huge injustice but the initial response of the department was to reject our findings
POD1000000014_S0000062	so that required a high publicity campaign which ultimately led to the government changing its mind
POD1000000014_S0000063	to be fair i suspect if ministers had been involved from the outset i do not think that the rejection we initially saw would have happened
POD1000000014_S0000064	did any of the people who experience this detriment get in touch with you or was this a nature of you seeing the unfairness and acting on their behalf
POD1000000014_S0000065	no we had a small number of cases but we investigated the whole scheme so some of the people who benefited would not even have known of my office
POD1000000014_S0000066	so that is the advantage of having the power of own initiative to an ombudsman
POD1000000014_S0000067	yes it is you can investigate
POD1000000014_S0000068	even if you get complaints sometimes you are constrained because you can only investigate on the facts if you can not undertake own initiative investigations
POD1000000014_S0000069	something comes up that needs to be looked at there is no constraints on me looking at that
POD1000000014_S0000070	and particularly i found that in the context of excluded groups it is a very powerful tool to use to make sure that people who do not come to you can nonetheless have access to justice
POD1000000014_S0000071	yeah and is that regarded as controversial in ireland i would not have thought so
POD1000000014_S0000072	no no it is just part of the toolkit available to the office i do not think anybody gives it any 2nd thought
POD1000000014_S0000073	you behaved very bravely in this investigation because at one point when you were being blocked by ministers you threatened to go to the
POD1000000014_S0000075	is that right
POD1000000014_S0000076	when i was being blocked by officials i went to the minister for justice and threw him to
POD1000000014_S0000078	the prime minister
POD1000000014_S0000079	i asked that they personally look to resolve the matter because it was such a stark injustice and reflected very poorly on the government of ireland
POD1000000014_S0000081	and the minister for justice both acted with great expediency and the matter was resolved almost immediately following their intervention
POD1000000014_S0000082	i do not think you can be an effective ombudsman without having the kind of guts that you have shown throughout this
POD1000000014_S0000083	and i hope you will sympathize with those ombudsmen that do not have own initiative powers because it seems to me to be a great handicap
POD1000000014_S0000084	i think it is i mean even in a welsh context where i did not have them at the time
POD1000000014_S0000085	you could be investigating something in one health board and see immediately that it was likely that the same problems were arising elsewhere
POD1000000014_S0000086	but technically you could not extend your investigation beyond the body you were investigating
POD1000000014_S0000087	that ability to extend an investigation to cover whichever bodies are involved is very powerful
POD1000000014_S0000088	a lot of my work let us say with asylum seekers and refugees in accommodation provided on behalf of the government
POD1000000014_S0000089	and i will be looking at complaints that are to do with healthcare that are to do with access to benefits that are to do with all kinds of things access to housing
POD1000000014_S0000090	other than the services provided by the department of justice in providing the accommodation
POD1000000014_S0000091	so it is just that capacity to broaden out an investigation as well as the capacity to instigate an investigation where you do not have complaints
POD1000000014_S0000092	now my current own initiative investigation is looking at the situation of people under 65 living in nursing homes
POD1000000014_S0000093	that is become a much more pressing issue in the coronavirus crisis one of the people we have interviewed has already died another has contracted the virus
POD1000000014_S0000094	so although at this point it is not possible for obvious reasons to conclude the investigation
POD1000000014_S0000095	what we have done is written to the leaders of all the political parties who are currently involved in talks leading to the formation of a new government
POD1000000014_S0000096	to highlight the issue of people in institutional care so that at least what we have learned to date in the course of our investigation can hopefully help to shape the policies of the incoming government
POD1000000014_S0000097	can we just move on a little
POD1000000014_S0000098	you are the president of the international ombudsman institute which is a very important and prestigious job which is very valuable to ombudsman all over the world
POD1000000014_S0000099	what added value do you think the brings to to our discussions
POD1000000014_S0000100	i think one of the very important things is straightforwardly learning from each other
POD1000000014_S0000101	being an ombudsman is necessarily an isolated role what you can not do is be too close to the people in the services which are within your jurisdiction
POD1000000014_S0000102	so consequently we have more in common with each other than we do with the people whose services we are looking at and learning from each other is very important
POD1000000014_S0000103	he provides structured training opportunities that has been one of the the very valuable things we have done
POD1000000014_S0000104	it provides best practice papers to show how things can best be
POD1000000014_S0000105	and of course rob you yourself have been responsible for the best practice paper on peer review and the work you have done in that field
POD1000000014_S0000106	but also i think the ii has played a big part in supporting ombudsman organizations under threat
POD1000000014_S0000107	we have seen for instance colleagues in many countries around the world who because they are doing their job are being threatened or ignored by their governments
POD1000000014_S0000108	and we have seen things like budgets being cut and we have seen people being denounced by government ministers and so on
POD1000000014_S0000109	so the solidarity of the international ombudsman community is very important but we also intervene quite directly
POD1000000014_S0000110	give an example of cyprus where the auditor general was looking to interfere in the work of the ombudsman is office
POD1000000014_S0000111	following intervention from the and others with the government of cyprus and the parliament in particular the threats were withdrawn
POD1000000014_S0000112	in poland the ombudsman was threatened with large cuts to budget we sent in a commission of inquiry
POD1000000014_S0000113	we interviewed government ministers we interviewed the judiciary
POD1000000014_S0000114	we carried out press conferences we talked to ngos and we managed to get a stay of execution
POD1000000014_S0000115	so we saw major threats to democracy there but our intervention along with those of others has helped to ensure that that office is still there and is continuing to operate effectively
POD1000000014_S0000116	that polish intervention was crucial
POD1000000014_S0000117	and what is one of the remarkable things about it was that you actually went there did not just talk about it
POD1000000014_S0000118	but you put the political institutions under pressure by asking them to give an account of what they were doing
POD1000000014_S0000119	absolutely so we did that in person and we did it through the media so that it had a very high profile within poland i think it is it is no good
POD1000000014_S0000120	i did the same in cyprus media interviews talking to people on the ground
POD1000000014_S0000121	i think it is really important that solidarity is not something that comes just in the form of a letter though sometimes a letter can be effective enough in itself
POD1000000014_S0000122	but that you actually scale the intervention to the nature of the challenge
POD1000000014_S0000123	we have talked about this quite a lot when we have not been on the radio but
POD1000000014_S0000124	how important do you think it is that we as ombuds do not get involved in political matters
POD1000000014_S0000125	or do you think this is a cultural relic of british imperialism
POD1000000014_S0000127	whatever about british imperialism no i think it is a very complex question
POD1000000014_S0000128	i think that for an ombudsman not to be involved in politics is scarcely possible because what we are actually doing is overseeing services provided by the state
POD1000000014_S0000129	and so therefore any comment we make on those services has the potential to be political
POD1000000014_S0000130	what we can not be is party political and what we can not do is speak beyond the evidence of our case
POD1000000014_S0000131	so i talked earlier on about seeking to affect the formation of the government in ireland to promote particular policies to favor disadvantaged groups of people
POD1000000014_S0000132	but i am doing that on the basis of investigations i am carrying
POD1000000014_S0000133	i am not doing it as peter tindell citizen i am doing it as ombudsman of ireland based on the evidence from my casebook
POD1000000014_S0000134	and under those circumstances i think it is entirely appropriate to intervene
POD1000000014_S0000135	i think it becomes problematic if people are seen to be intervening on issues which go beyond their own work as ombudsman
POD1000000014_S0000136	i think that is where it would become problematic
POD1000000014_S0000137	but i do think that if you have got evidence then it is important that you use that evidence where it can be most effective in securing justice for the people who have come to you
POD1000000014_S0000138	so we are moving towards the end but i wanted to ask you about how you are coping with the coronavirus
POD1000000014_S0000139	what sort of impact has it had short term and long term on the way you operate
POD1000000014_S0000140	yeah it is an interesting one
POD1000000014_S0000141	the 1st thing was that we surprised ourselves by being able to get ourselves in a position to work remotely much quicker than we might have done otherwise
POD1000000014_S0000142	i suppose if it is proved anything it is that when there is a crisis it is surprising how long term problems can be solved in a hurry
POD1000000014_S0000143	and so we have been able to operate all of our services more or less without change throughout the crisis
POD1000000014_S0000144	we have had some changes in volumes of work coming to us
POD1000000014_S0000145	we put a bit more emphasis on project work but by and large people are able to make their complaints to
POD1000000014_S0000146	they can bring us they can email us
POD1000000014_S0000147	they can contact us on the web
POD1000000014_S0000148	we are even able to collect our posts though we are discouraging people from using the post at the moment but the effect of that is that we can keep going
POD1000000014_S0000149	the difficulties we face are probably more to do with the difficulties being faced by the services we are dealing with
POD1000000014_S0000150	so we have told the health service we have told nursing homes and we have told the department of social protection which deals with benefits and pensions
POD1000000014_S0000151	that we understand that it will take them longer to respond to us and that in some instances they will not be able to
POD1000000014_S0000152	so so we understand that but in general we have been able to keep going
POD1000000014_S0000153	just to give an example of the kind of things we have been dealing with
POD1000000014_S0000154	we had one gentleman stuck in poland who could not get back to ireland who had been denied benefit in ireland even though his wife and children were in ireland and he normally lived and worked
POD1000000014_S0000155	and we were able to intervene successfully so that he got his benefits so we are able to deal with issues as they arise
POD1000000014_S0000156	i think in the longer term there will be 2 things really one of them is just practical
POD1000000014_S0000157	we now know that it is possible for more of our people to work effectively from home and i can not see us going back to the situation before where only a very small number of people did that
POD1000000014_S0000158	i think more people will work from home as a consequence of what we have learned during the crisis
POD1000000014_S0000159	but the 2nd issue for me has been the appalling death toll among people in institutional care many of whom should not be there
POD1000000014_S0000160	and i think we have to redouble our efforts in working on their behalf after the crisis to make sure that should there be a resurgence or should something else like this come along
POD1000000014_S0000161	that they are not as exposed and as vulnerable as they are at the moment
POD1000000014_S0000162	it makes complete sense for the ombudsman to be looking at both health and social care matters
POD1000000014_S0000163	and not as in this country to have a separation where one ombudsman looks at social care and the other looks at health
POD1000000014_S0000164	i will just if i may rub just add something
POD1000000014_S0000165	one of the things that is noticeably different between ireland and the uk and england in particular is that there is a single national ombudsman in ireland
POD1000000014_S0000166	that issues of health and social care both come into my jurisdiction
POD1000000014_S0000167	the reality is these are complex interlinked issues
POD1000000014_S0000168	and trying to deal with them with 2 separate ombudsman offices is complicated enough as it is
POD1000000014_S0000169	trying to do so in the context where you have filters
POD1000000014_S0000170	where you have different systems applying in different parts of the uk it is impossibly difficult for yourselves
POD1000000014_S0000171	but you manage it very well along with the local government ombuds
POD1000000014_S0000172	i have to say you have managed in practice to overcome the difficulties but it is also an impossibly complex scenario for complainants
POD1000000014_S0000173	in ireland somebody wants to complain about public services they come to my office
POD1000000014_S0000174	in your case it is much more complicated
POD1000000014_S0000175	i do hope that the proposals for ombudsman reform that we have seen in the uk over recent years are not entirely lost
POD1000000014_S0000176	and that we do come to a much more satisfactory situation where there is a proper national ombudsman and where people can bring their complaints regardless of what particular public service they are complaining about
POD1000000014_S0000177	and i do hope happens before i die which i am increasingly becoming doubtful about but we will we will have to wait and see
POD1000000014_S0000178	peter you conducted the peer review of my organization and then you appeared before the select committee in parliament
POD1000000014_S0000179	so that was not unexpected development
POD1000000014_S0000180	what was it like being being the peer reviewer who had to go before the uk parliament
POD1000000014_S0000181	it was an interesting experience
POD1000000014_S0000182	think it would have been much more challenging if i had not been quite so impressed by the quality of the service your office provides
POD1000000014_S0000183	it was not as though when we looked at the service we used a lot of objective criteria
POD1000000014_S0000184	and obviously with any office there is room for improvement but in general i was able to give reassurance to the committee as the quality of service that complainants were receiving
POD1000000014_S0000185	also to highlight some of the deficiencies in power and in jurisdiction that are causing you difficulties in practice
POD1000000014_S0000186	but i suppose what i want to say i was very impressed by the quality of the people in your office
POD1000000014_S0000187	it was a very good experience they were very open with us
POD1000000014_S0000188	we talked to your staff without talking to yourself and the managers so we were able for people to express a view as they saw fit and i think people were very complimentary
POD1000000014_S0000189	so i think as i say it was an interesting experience
POD1000000014_S0000190	it is always challenging to go before parliamentary committees and the session was quite searching
POD1000000014_S0000191	i think the committee wanted to reassure itself that this was not some kind of hagiography
POD1000000014_S0000192	but we were satisfied in the end that we were able to say no we have looked in detail at this office
POD1000000014_S0000193	there are areas which can improve but by and large this is an improving service that is delivering good quality ombudsman service to the people of england and to the u k
POD1000000014_S0000194	i think the structural point is that thanks to the ioi this this whole system of peer review looks like it has legs for the wider ombudsman community
POD1000000014_S0000195	it is an effective and inexpensive way of adding to scrutiny of ombudsman scheme so thank you for the role that you played in pioneering that
POD1000000014_S0000196	one thing beyond that roberts that
POD1000000014_S0000197	since the review was undertaken the ii along with other bodies have worked quite hard
POD1000000014_S0000198	with the venice commission and the council of europe in developing a set of overriding principles for ombudsman offices the venice principles as they have become known
POD1000000014_S0000199	and they have now been adopted by the council of europe
POD1000000014_S0000200	that is the 1st time there has been a proper international standard against which ombuds officers can be judged
POD1000000014_S0000201	and so i am keen to see them being used as they are being used now in the context of peer review
POD1000000014_S0000202	so that there is an objective set of internationally recognized standards against which you are measuring a particular ombudsman office
POD1000000014_S0000203	i think that is again marks another step forward and one that i am very pleased to have seen develop
POD1000000014_S0000204	i think when i undertook the peer review of the catalonian ombudsman with my belgian counterpart
POD1000000014_S0000205	we used those very same venice principles as the benchmark against which to judge the catalonian ombudsman
POD1000000014_S0000206	it is very helpful to have that because it is without prejudice
POD1000000014_S0000207	it applies to everyone so i think it is an important development
POD1000000014_S0000208	so 2 final questions how have you peter tindell reacted to working remotely being at home with your family
POD1000000014_S0000209	i have enjoyed it to be honest
POD1000000014_S0000210	it has not been too frustrating that technology can be an issue from time to time but it has not been too difficult
POD1000000014_S0000211	it has been less difficult than i would have expected
POD1000000014_S0000212	as time goes on i think the issue of visible leadership comes into it does not
POD1000000014_S0000213	so you know you actually want to be with your people again but but it works surprisingly well
POD1000000014_S0000214	
POD1000000014_S0000215	as i say i think for the office itself i think we will see more remote working in the future
POD1000000014_S0000216	thank you so lastly then what i always ask my guests
POD1000000014_S0000217	what advice would you give to young colleagues newly arriving as caseworkers in the embryonic ombudsman profession
POD1000000014_S0000218	for me there is there is a couple of characteristics that have to be embodied by people working in the service or as an ombudsman
POD1000000014_S0000219	we have to be objective we have to be fair
POD1000000014_S0000220	we have to be even handed so the 1st advice often is make sure you know the whole story before you reach a conclusion
POD1000000014_S0000221	but underpinning all of that i would say that if you have not got a passionate commitment to justice then you are in the wrong job
POD1000000014_S0000222	because what this fundamentally is about is people who believe in fairness people who believe in justice and people who want to use their own efforts to make sure that nobody is denied access to justice
POD1000000014_S0000223	that is what we are here for
POD1000000014_S0000224	thank you so much peter
POD1000000014_S0000225	your answers were stimulating and also inspire
POD1000000014_S0000227	we are all very grateful for the time you have given for this interview
POD1000000014_S0000228	thanks a lot
POD1000000014_S0000230	my next guest will be the catalonian ombudsman rafael rebo
POD1000000014_S0000231	so he will be joining us from barcelona
POD1000000014_S0000232	in the meantime robbers on behalf of radio ombudsman saying have a good day and stay safe
POD1000000017_S0000001	from the new york times magazine i am nicole hannah jones this is 1619
POD1000000017_S0000003	this week wesley morris on the birth of american music
POD1000000017_S0000005	so last fall i am at my friend is house we are making dinner i am chopping vegetables and i asked my friend brett who was cooking with me can you put on some music
POD1000000017_S0000006	and he said what do you want to listen to and i said have you ever heard of a rock and he said what i said at rock have you ever heard of this and he goes no i have not
POD1000000017_S0000007	so he finds the rock station in pandora which i do not know why or how he is still a pandora guy with all due respect to pandora he is one and he finds the rock station
POD1000000017_S0000009	at some point right has to go run and and i think i might have sent him on one i do not remember but he has gone so i am alone just me with the vegetables and a rock
POD1000000017_S0000011	it gives me plenty of time to really think about the songs i am hearing
POD1000000017_S0000013	we are talking about music made between the years of i do not know i would say like 1975 to about 1983 things like
POD1000000017_S0000015	is how long
POD1000000017_S0000017	seals and craft doing summer breeze i am hearing things like
POD1000000017_S0000019	steal away by robbie dupre
POD1000000017_S0000021	and the doobie brothers what a fool believes
POD1000000017_S0000023	it is like our soft rokos period in american popular music
POD1000000017_S0000025	the joke of arrack is that whoever invented it whoever is making a playlist out of these songs is basically saying that they are inconsequential and that what is in them does not matter
POD1000000017_S0000027	but what i know i am hearing is something bigger and deeper than that
POD1000000017_S0000029	every song has something about it that is similar to the other song
POD1000000017_S0000031	i am hearing things like rosannah by toto
POD1000000017_S0000033	which seems perfectly banal has a really good beat sort of build to its chorus
POD1000000017_S0000035	then at the end
POD1000000017_S0000037	i am hearing
POD1000000017_S0000039	great do harmonies of the 50 s and 60 s
POD1000000017_S0000041	there is something jazz like in the syncopated music of something like steely dan
POD1000000017_S0000043	you can hear in somebody like michael mcdonald
POD1000000017_S0000045	that is like a gospel breakdown
POD1000000017_S0000047	what i am hearing in all of these songs is basically blackness
POD1000000017_S0000049	and the song in which i am hearing it the deepest and strongest and most powerfully at least to me standing in that kitchen shopping those vegetables was when kenny loggins this is it comes
POD1000000017_S0000051	it has got a kind of loosely disco like rhythm to it there is a lot of percussion sort of going back and forth and around
POD1000000017_S0000053	kenny loggins is basically sing whispering the verses of the song
POD1000000017_S0000055	in this very light
POD1000000017_S0000056	
POD1000000017_S0000058	and then on the pre chorus kenny loggins disappears and who shows up michael mcdonald
POD1000000017_S0000060	giving kenny loggins plenty of time to gather himself
POD1000000017_S0000062	when he sings the word miracle he does not sing miracle he goes miracle
POD1000000017_S0000064	like he is scraping the bottom of a pan to get all of the good bits off of it before you pour the gravy in
POD1000000017_S0000066	scraping the pan is the blackest thing you can do as a singer and here is kenny loggins as this white artist doing
POD1000000017_S0000068	and then the gravy comes
POD1000000017_S0000070	he is like at the top of the church at this point
POD1000000017_S0000071	he has like elevated himself to the rafters there is like no he is like at the roof trying to clear a way to get to heaven but there is just church roof in the way
POD1000000017_S0000073	he is not the greatest singer but there is a kind of gumption and nerve to the singing of the song
POD1000000017_S0000075	it cannot be denied a tip of the hat to him
POD1000000017_S0000076	i just had to stand there and i just i actually cracked up i had to i just put down the knife and i cracked up and it felt so pleasurable and then i started thinking about all these other singers i love
POD1000000017_S0000078	i am thinking about amy white house
POD1000000017_S0000080	i am thinking about annie lennox that
POD1000000017_S0000082	think about george michael
POD1000000017_S0000084	i think about chris stapleton
POD1000000017_S0000085	who practices a kind of muscle blues that gets written off his country because he is a big white guy in a hat
POD1000000017_S0000087	and one of the many phases in which david boy really wanted to make r and b and soul music
POD1000000017_S0000089	this is the sound not just of black america but the sound of america it is deeply american almost especially when it is sung by british people like david bowie and annie lennox and amy winehouse
POD1000000017_S0000090	and it fills me with pride like i know that there is something irresistible and ultimately inevitable about black music being a part of american popular music
POD1000000017_S0000091	but it also reminds me that there is a history to this a very painful history and in the most perversely ironic way it is this historical pain that is responsible for this music
POD1000000017_S0000093	some of the oldest recordings we have of black american music are from the 1930 s
POD1000000017_S0000094	and there are songs that would have been sung by americans born into slavery there is this one called old ship of zion
POD1000000017_S0000095	you can hear in it these 4 men their voices are moving in and out of each other
POD1000000017_S0000097	and it is beautiful and it is also sad you can feel that in your bones
POD1000000017_S0000098	and then there would be music that was completely the opposite like old dog for instance
POD1000000017_S0000100	you can hear the playfulness in the song
POD1000000017_S0000102	and you have got this banjo this great african instrument that becomes the bedrock of american music in so many ways and that thing is dancing
POD1000000017_S0000103	and then it will be to the landing corner you have someone like billy mcray can be
POD1000000017_S0000104	and 0 my god as you can hear in his singing what we would now call something like the livelong day
POD1000000017_S0000106	years and years of hard work
POD1000000017_S0000107	an unimaginable sorrow
POD1000000017_S0000109	you can also hear in all of this music
POD1000000017_S0000111	this undeniable sound of hope
POD1000000017_S0000113	all of these melodies and cadences and emotions are things that would have been passed down generation after generation it is what you would have heard on a plantation it is what you would have heard walking by a plantation
POD1000000017_S0000114	it is what you would have heard passing a black person doing his job entertaining himself doing the drudgery of work the way a guy named thomas dartmouth rice did sometime around the 1830 s
POD1000000017_S0000115	as the story goes twice a white man this anonymous nobody actor trying to make ends meet
POD1000000017_S0000116	one day he is touring with a troop in cincinnati or maybe it was pittsburg we do not really know but the myth basically goes trace happened upon an old black man cleaning a horse in a stable
POD1000000017_S0000117	the man was doing his job on property owned by a white man named crow
POD1000000017_S0000119	he heard the tune this old black man was singing he saw the way this man moved his body as he was cleaning his horse
POD1000000017_S0000120	now we do not know what tune this old man would have been singing
POD1000000017_S0000122	whatever i hear is coming out of this man is mouth is captivating to him and what he sees is an opportunity
POD1000000017_S0000124	because she is in the 1830 s looked like this
POD1000000017_S0000126	italian operas
POD1000000017_S0000128	british plays entertainment imported from europe all the people performing this stuff would have been white the audiences would have been white
POD1000000017_S0000129	after all it is 1830 slavery is in full effect
POD1000000017_S0000131	and when it came to entertainment there was nothing new nothing truly american
POD1000000017_S0000133	and so when cedric hears this black man singing this song moving his body in this particular way ding a light bulb goes off
POD1000000017_S0000134	and he takes that light bulb and runs all the way to the theater he figures out a way to melt down some cork
POD1000000017_S0000135	lets it cool presumably takes a rag or maybe even his hand it is cool enough
POD1000000017_S0000137	and then he paint his face black
POD1000000017_S0000139	he goes out on stage but instead of doing his regular act he has got this horse groomers tune except now he is given the tune lyrics
POD1000000017_S0000140	come listen all you girls and boys i am just from cuero i am going to sing a little song my name is jim crow
POD1000000017_S0000142	and the lyrics give the horse gromer a name and the name is jim crow
POD1000000017_S0000144	so the crowd goes crazy they go so bananas the man gets 20 anchors
POD1000000017_S0000146	this is the 1st time a paying audience is basically electrified by a white man with a black face this is the night that jim crow was allegedly introduced to america this mascot of american racism
POD1000000017_S0000147	and this is what america really wanted which was its own original art form that is not an italian opera and is not some british guy coming over and using all over them
POD1000000017_S0000148	and here is thomas dartmouth rice giving it to them this is the night that american popular culture was born
POD1000000017_S0000150	0 boy i mean you know how it goes this sensational thing happens and then everybody wants to get on the bandwagon and do their own
POD1000000017_S0000151	so you have other minstrel acts who come along and try to do what thomas dartmouth rice is doing a song and dance
POD1000000017_S0000152	and a black face on their white skin
POD1000000017_S0000154	and then from these solo acts you have basically bands forming
POD1000000017_S0000156	and the bands have all the instruments that you would have in a band that you would recognize now there is a banjo and fiddle and some tambourines and percussion in the form of bones which would come from a pig sometimes
POD1000000017_S0000157	that is the formation of what will become the minstrel trope
POD1000000017_S0000159	and the place that minstrelsy took hold was in the north
POD1000000017_S0000160	places like philadelphia and new york and boston where you have these theaters dedicated to minstrel acts were minstrel acts would just move into a theater and do their act night after night after night after night after night
POD1000000017_S0000161	and a lot of these performers never been meaningfully south to have a meaningful relationship with black people and so they just made stuff up based on what they thought black people were like
POD1000000017_S0000163	they were able to draw on things that were coming to america from other parts of europe like the polka
POD1000000017_S0000165	and so you had over the course of the formation of this culture an inherent mixing you had some amazing mix of an imagined blackness
POD1000000017_S0000166	real actual irish melodies and polish music with what we would now call gospel but spiritual harmonies interlaced together with this african bange
POD1000000017_S0000168	basically welding into a fusion that becomes the thing that everybody wants to try to do
POD1000000017_S0000170	the whole thing just sweeps the nation and for the rest of the 19th century this is the shit can we say that
POD1000000017_S0000172	and so for the rest of the 19th century this is the shit
POD1000000017_S0000174	this is america is primary form of entertainment people are going crazy for blackface minstrels you have little boys going to bed and dreaming about how they can become part of this minstrel show
POD1000000017_S0000175	some of those people having these dreams go on to become people like stephen foster
POD1000000017_S0000177	stephen foster the man widely credited as being the father of american music
POD1000000017_S0000179	some of his songs some of his most famous songs songs you know songs you love songs you still sing songs your children if you have them they still sing some of those songs were written for blackface performers
POD1000000017_S0000181	and if you listen to something like camptown races you can hear in it all of its minstrel property
POD1000000017_S0000183	the song of course is written in so called negro dialect i mean instead of saying going you are saying in
POD1000000017_S0000185	like instead of saying of for you get a lot of de ford
POD1000000017_S0000187	this is a white person imagining how a black person would sing this song
POD1000000017_S0000188	and that was the gold rush era hit
POD1000000017_S0000190	this is the i want to hold your hand of 1851
POD1000000017_S0000192	part of the problem that we still live with now is that it was so much the heart and soul of american culture that it was not that it became not racist
POD1000000017_S0000193	it just was a thing that you did if you wanted to be an entertainer at any point after 1830 you in all likelihood were at least going to try to be a blackface minstrel even if you were black
POD1000000017_S0000195	after the civil war ends and there is an opportunity for black people to perform they have to do what the nation wants and what the nation wants at that point is blackface
POD1000000017_S0000196	and now giving you noise in tempo
POD1000000017_S0000197	miller and shatman career
POD1000000017_S0000198	so black people blacked up and performed as black people who were not actually black
POD1000000017_S0000200	by the time you have black people painting their faces black to perform as black people the only question you can really ask at this point is what the hell is going on why is this happening
POD1000000017_S0000201	what was so captivating about seeing black people represented this way why would a white audience have clamored for it so much i think one of the things that it offered was an opportunity to feel good about a thing that actually felt really bad at the time
POD1000000017_S0000202	people were really torn about whether to continue with slavery or whether to abolish it the minstrel show did not really give you an answer
POD1000000017_S0000203	it provided a platform by which you could either escape from actually having to think about that question that really was tearing the nation apart or depending on which show you would wind up seeing
POD1000000017_S0000204	it fully engaged you in the lightest possible way about enslaved people and how you did not really have to feel so bad for them because they like being enslaved you got to laugh at a thing that you actually felt so anguished about
POD1000000017_S0000205	you get to watch these black people who are really a source of national agony outside the theater become fools inside the theater and in sitting in that theater watching these white men in blackface make fools of black people
POD1000000017_S0000206	a white audience could feel cultured they could feel civilized they could feel superior to the people they were watching be made fun of
POD1000000017_S0000207	and in a crazy way watching them dehumanize would really have been an opportunity for a white audience to feel so much better about their own humanity
POD1000000017_S0000209	by the time you get to the 20th century minstrelsy is still with us it is the basis upon which american movies are built this country is 1st movie blockbuster
POD1000000017_S0000210	d w griffith the birth of a nation full of white men villainously in blackface

POD1000000017_S0000216	it is when he blacks his face up and performs mammy as a negro
POD1000000017_S0000218	some of america is favorite stars did numbers in blackface

POD1000000017_S0000226	but at the same time there is the beginnings of a recording industry and you had black artists who had access to recording studios
POD1000000017_S0000227	out of these recordings you have people like muddy waters
POD1000000017_S0000229	inventing and perfecting blues rhythm blues ideas blues expression the expression of
POD1000000017_S0000231	of a fully human black self in american popular art
POD1000000017_S0000233	he had a kind of confidence that most people would never have heard coming from a black person before
POD1000000017_S0000235	and this is just the beginning
POD1000000017_S0000237	you have the advent of a place like blue no records where lots of amazing jazz was created and then released into the world people like sydney bush
POD1000000017_S0000239	armstrong
POD1000000017_S0000241	and duke ellington
POD1000000017_S0000243	you have black musicians thinking about how to move not only music forward but american culture forward
POD1000000017_S0000245	thinking about how these instruments can do other things besides make what we think of as western european classical music
POD1000000017_S0000247	taking music to a place that nobody had ever tried to previously take
POD1000000017_S0000249	people who just kept pushing it forward and beyond
POD1000000017_S0000251	and then you have the development of the single most important movement black people have ever had artistically
POD1000000017_S0000253	and that is the advent of motown records
POD1000000017_S0000255	motown is the most powerful mass produced expression of black glamour of black self confidence of black self reliance
POD1000000017_S0000257	it is project was to get black producers black musicians black singers to take quote white quote western musical ideas of orchestration strings and horns
POD1000000017_S0000259	in straightforward harmonies
POD1000000017_S0000261	and you marry them to a black weekend
POD1000000017_S0000263	where on saturday night you are at duke joint having a good time with rhythm and blues music guitar and drum base
POD1000000017_S0000265	so basically
POD1000000017_S0000267	and then you go home slightly hungover
POD1000000017_S0000269	and you wake up and you go to church on sunday morning
POD1000000017_S0000271	where there is a whole other musical experience involving handclaps and different harmonic arrangements and call and response
POD1000000017_S0000273	a lot of feeling a lot of a lot of gratitude
POD1000000017_S0000275	you have the combination of these 3 different areas of musical expression happening at the same time in just about every single motown
POD1000000017_S0000277	whether it is the foretop doing reach out i will be there
POD1000000017_S0000279	or martha and the vandellas doing heat wave
POD1000000017_S0000281	on something like heatwave you can hear hands slapping the tambourine like it actually is sunday morning
POD1000000017_S0000283	and when everything is firing
POD1000000017_S0000285	it is just the most exciting romantic sound you are you are ever going to hear and at the center of it is what can only be described as a refulgent tasteful blackness
POD1000000017_S0000287	here you have in motown a force that is actively combating these ideas of black people as being inherently inferior
POD1000000017_S0000289	motown is the antidote to american minstrelsy
POD1000000017_S0000291	and this is what i was thinking about standing there in that kitchen chopping those vegetables it is the thing that made me laugh was just how all that history
POD1000000017_S0000292	is just very silently coursing through this music it might not even be aware that it is even there it is so thoroughly atomized into american culture it is going to show up in ways that even people making the art can not quite put their finger on
POD1000000017_S0000294	what you are hearing in black music that is so appealing to so many people of all races across time is possibility struggle it is strife it is humor
POD1000000017_S0000295	it is sex it is confidence and that is ironic because this is the sound of a people who for decades and centuries have been denied freedom
POD1000000017_S0000296	and yet what you respond to in black music is the ultimate expression of a belief in that freedom the belief that the struggle is worth it that the pain begets joy
POD1000000017_S0000297	and that that joy you are experiencing is not only contagious it is necessary and urgent and irresistible black music is american music
POD1000000017_S0000298	because as americans we say we believe in freedom and that is what we tell the world and the power of black music is that it is the ultimate expression of that belief in american freedom
POD1000000018_S0000000	when andy griffith passed away in 2012 cnn covered his death off and on the entire day
POD1000000018_S0000001	you have all seen this type of news coverage before an overview of the career images of the star in their prime phone in conversations with other celebrities who were close with the departed
POD1000000018_S0000003	larry king is one of the people who called him to talk that day he had andy on his various shows numerous times and he mentioned something in passing that is really interesting
POD1000000018_S0000005	what larry said is that a lawyer named percy foreman was the man who inspired the character matlock
POD1000000018_S0000007	this was a weird thing for anyone to say because most people even today believe that character to be based on a different lawyer named bobby lee cook
POD1000000018_S0000009	however in 20153 years after larry king said something that most people would assume was incorrect the creator of matlock did confirm that the character was based on percy fourman
POD1000000018_S0000010	a criminal defense attorney from houston texas who lost only 53 of the 1500 cases where clients of his face the death penalty with only one of those losses resulting in an actual execution
POD1000000018_S0000012	percy was able to achieve this record by being an incredible lawyer no denying it but also due to the texas court system is practice of using juries to determine guilt as well as sentencing in the case of a guilty verdict
POD1000000018_S0000014	so instead of one judge who is heard it all before determining his client is fate
POD1000000018_S0000016	percy had 12 average citizens from the local community sitting right there waiting to be convinced that the victim in this situation was not a victim at all
POD1000000018_S0000017	they were up to no good the community was far better off without that element in it and even if his client had killed him well hell they needed killing
POD1000000018_S0000019	foreman called it misdemeanor murder that is where a jury might convict you of ending another person is life and send you on your way with the type of punishment you would receive for a misdemeanor crime
POD1000000018_S0000020	often nothing more than probation no time at all it is essentially a sanctioned form of vigilante justice
POD1000000018_S0000021	percy fourman had such a long run of wins with this strategy that it is still being used in texas today people who have conversations about this sort of thing will sometimes refer to it as the texas defense
POD1000000018_S0000023	now jim denny was not from texas he was from tennessee
POD1000000018_S0000024	the buffalo valley area about 60 miles east of nashville was a real poor area to be born in 1911
POD1000000018_S0000025	when a 16 year old jim denny got hired to work the mailroom of wsm radio is parent company he must have seen it as an opportunity to make something out of himself
POD1000000018_S0000027	denny got this job in 1927 that year the young radio program barn dance was referred to as the grand ole opera for the 1st time on air
POD1000000018_S0000029	every time an odd job came up at the opera jim would take it so he could hang out backstage see the artists and see how the show was made
POD1000000018_S0000030	within 20 years denny had worked his way up to director of the artist service bureau at which meant he was in charge of booking the ax on the opera
POD1000000018_S0000032	there is a few funny things from jim denny is time at the grand ole opera like the one about elvis presley is big debut
POD1000000018_S0000033	elvis was still a teenager when denny did sam phillips the favor of letting elvis come on the show to play his not country arrangement of blue moon of kentucky
POD1000000018_S0000035	it did not go well denny is rumored to have told elvis backstage you aint going nowhere son you ought to go back to driving a truck
POD1000000018_S0000037	denny is also the guy who fired hank williams over the telephone and there is the time when jim made johnny cash wait outside his office for 2 hours before letting him in to ask why cash should be allowed to play on the opera
POD1000000018_S0000039	kash mentioned that he presently had a song called i walk the line in the top 10
POD1000000018_S0000041	jim denny was what many people referred to in those times as a hard man today i think they would have some different words for him and that is why earnest tub tried to shoot him in 1957
POD1000000018_S0000043	you are listening to cocaine and rhinestones the podcast about 20th century country music and the lives of those who gave it to us
POD1000000018_S0000044	my name is tyler maaco i have heard these stories my whole life
POD1000000018_S0000045	as far as i can tell here is the truth about this one
POD1000000018_S0000047	it is shocking to hear ernest tub is name associated with any kind of violence whatsoever
POD1000000018_S0000049	there are plenty of stories about him but most of them are about how great of a guy he was he had an adorable nickname and you can hear admiration in the voice of everyone who calls him that
POD1000000018_S0000051	crisp texas is a ghost town now ernest was born there in 1914 into a family of sharecroppers like most sharecroppers children ernest grew up working on farms all over the area
POD1000000018_S0000052	long days in the field entertainment from a stereo in the evenings an early bedtime and you get back up the next day to do it all over again typical day for a sharecropper
POD1000000018_S0000054	like a great number of artists will learn about in future episodes it was all over for a 14 year old earnest tub the 1st time he heard jimmy rogers sing
POD1000000018_S0000056	the obsession was instant and it would steer the course of the rest of his life
POD1000000018_S0000058	hearing jimmy rogers is what led earnest to decide he simply had to become a country singer
POD1000000018_S0000059	it is also very specifically what caused him 3 decades later to want to shoot a 357 magnum at jim denny
POD1000000018_S0000061	in 1933 jimmy rogers died young of tuberculosis he was 35
POD1000000018_S0000062	the death of his idol was extremely upsetting for ernest however it also made him realize that he was going to have to get serious about chasing his dreams
POD1000000018_S0000063	he moved to san antonio made a few guest appearances on a friend is radio show and managed to secure his own early morning show which aired twice a week not bad for a 19 year old kid
POD1000000018_S0000064	but do not get the wrong idea he was nowhere near the big time and the pay was quite slim
POD1000000018_S0000066	had to keep 2 other jobs besides the radio gig some days he was a ditch digger in other days a drug store clerk
POD1000000018_S0000067	holding down 3 jobs at once was necessary to support himself and his young wife elaine they did not waste any time before starting to have kids either
POD1000000018_S0000069	ernest was more than happy to work hard if it kept him moving towards the life of his hero jimmy rogers
POD1000000018_S0000070	he would had this small picture of jimmy for years now and it was in pretty bad shape so he got a phone book and looked up the number for jimmy rogers widow care
POD1000000018_S0000071	he called her on the phone to explain that he was such a big fan and to see if she happened to have a bigger better photo of jimmy that ernest could have maybe even one that was autographed
POD1000000018_S0000072	carrie was super nice and she did have such a photo that ernest could have and went so far as to invite him out to her house in carville texas to get the picture
POD1000000018_S0000073	ernest drove out there the next sunday he was not working taking elane and their baby justin on the trip
POD1000000018_S0000075	they planned to stay for maybe 10 minutes and ended up hanging out for over 2 hours looking at costumes guitars and pictures brought out by missus rogers hearing her stories about how high on the hog they would lived merely a few years earlier
POD1000000018_S0000076	it could never have guessed when he woke up that morning that he would be lying down to sleep that night having held jimmy rogers signature martin acoustic guitar with jimmy is name inlaid in pearl across the fretboard and the word thanks written on the back upside down
POD1000000018_S0000077	so he could flip it over to show audiences
POD1000000018_S0000079	choose your biggest dead hero and try to think of how you would feel if a similar experience happened to you it is mind blowing
POD1000000018_S0000080	okay now add this on top of that a few months later carrie rogers called ernest to say she would listened for his radio show as he would asked for her to do
POD1000000018_S0000081	on one hand she offered to help out with the access she still had to music business big shots
POD1000000018_S0000082	on the other hand she did not think he sounded like jimmy rogers when he sang which is basically the only thing in the world earnest hub wanted to do in this phase of his life
POD1000000018_S0000083	and everyone around him had told him that is exactly what he had been doing the whole time
POD1000000018_S0000085	anyway she is still hooked up with else macwilliams the writer of a few great jimmy rogers songs
POD1000000018_S0000086	ernest tub made a couple of records that did not sell very well did some touring and ended up back home doing low paying radio again and working 2 or 3 side jobs like before driving around a beer truck was one of them
POD1000000018_S0000088	after a while back at home ernest had to have his tonsils taken out he would later say the doctors told him not to sing or odle for a while after the surgery but he did not listen
POD1000000018_S0000089	jumping right back into his normal routine re injured his throat
POD1000000018_S0000091	it changed his voice forever
POD1000000018_S0000093	ernest held a self deprecating sense of humor about his own voice for the rest of his life he loved to say that 9 out of 10 guys sitting in bars around the country could sing much better than he could
POD1000000018_S0000094	i do not know if he really believed that it is always been strange to me i think george jones indisputably the greatest country singer in history is exactly what happens when you add ernest tubs new singing style and roy cuffs voice together
POD1000000018_S0000096	just heard some earnest here is a little rykoff from 1942
POD1000000018_S0000098	now george jones would have told you hank williams was his favorite singer you do not get hank without earnest and roy i have seen lefty frizell named as an influence on george
POD1000000018_S0000099	left borrowed from ernest as well however you want to say we got to george jones it always comes back to roy acoff and ernest tub
POD1000000018_S0000100	now the part of earnest you can hear in george is the tendency to hold onto a note for longer than you would expect picking the melody up and putting it back down in ways that are impossible to predict when hearing them sing a song for the 1st time

POD1000000018_S0000122	he was the 1st one to call names out on records and he loved doing that he loved the guys and they were a big part of his show i mean and he wanted to make sure they got the credit for
POD1000000018_S0000123	so he started calling their names out when they took a course but he was never jealous of anybody in his band outshining him he did not you know he did not mind that at all as he rowed with jack green and carl smith and
POD1000000018_S0000124	and of course he had the wilbert with him for a while and skater worked some dates with him george jones stonewall jackson and he was always pushing them and he like roy i think understood that the bigger they became the bigger he became
POD1000000018_S0000125	george jones and stonewall jackson were never texas troubadours justin meant et took those guys out on tour with him as opening a to help them build their own following and often he did a lot more than that

POD1000000018_S0000136	and he let me go out and i opened his show for him for 10 days and he fed me and at the end of the tour gave me some money so that is kind of guy he was
POD1000000018_S0000138	you can not tell the hank snow story without talking about earnest tub told johnny cash not to smile when he performed wholesome prison blues so people in the audience could really feel the song
POD1000000018_S0000139	she never forgot the advice hank williams senior was heavily influenced by earnest music and earnest is the one who convinced the grand ole opera to bring hank back after his 1st failed audition
POD1000000018_S0000140	it got hank to promise he would not touch any books for 3 months to swing that one
POD1000000018_S0000141	in 1947 enough radio listeners wrote letters complaining of not being able to find his music that he launched the earnest to record shop in nashville if you could not make it there in person they would ship records directly to you
POD1000000018_S0000142	it was a game changer for country music fans and would help keep the music alive when rock and roll steamrolled america in the 50 s
POD1000000018_S0000144	the record shop operated at a loss of $10000 a year for the 1st 2 years it was open but earnest knew how important it was and he kept it alive
POD1000000018_S0000145	the opera was a great promotional tool for him and he would started his own show on in the following timeslot when the opera was over fans could stay tuned in for the midnight jamboree
POD1000000018_S0000147	ernest played host to opera stars and newcomers alike making sure to remind you this music was available for mail order from ernest tub is record shop he took the chance to keep jimmy rogers memory alive pitching his records as well
POD1000000018_S0000149	ernest never grew out of his fascination with jimmy rogers and never stopped paying his debt to jimmy is widow care jimmy is death had left carrie in a pretty bad financial situation but she still got money from the sale of his records which were declining
POD1000000018_S0000150	he realized the more jimmy rogers records sold the better off carry would be so e t pushed those records as hard as he could
POD1000000018_S0000151	carrie loaned and eventually flat out gave him that guitar of jimmy is which is why you will frequently see pictures or videos of earnest tub playing a guitar that says jimmy rogers on it
POD1000000018_S0000152	in 1953 ernest helped found the jimmy rogers memorial festival in roger is hometown of meridian mississippi that is a stand up guy
POD1000000018_S0000154	you can find plenty of people who will say the same thing about jim denny
POD1000000018_S0000155	remember jim poor kid from tennessee worked his way up from the mailroom to become director of artist services at wsm and manager of the grand ole opera
POD1000000018_S0000156	director of artist services was a fancy way of saying he booked the musical as that played on the radio station as well as the opera
POD1000000018_S0000157	denny was a powerful man in nashville and he acted like he knew it
POD1000000018_S0000158	where ernest tub built a reputation for helping young musicians jim denny had a reputation for acting like a dick
POD1000000018_S0000160	the johnny cash et gave advice to is the same johnny cash who had to wait 2 hours outside denny is office
POD1000000018_S0000162	jim denny might not have been a dick he could have simply been a businessman who paid more attention to the bottom line than how many friends he had
POD1000000018_S0000163	denny is the guy who had to be convinced to let hank senior onto the opera and he is the guy who called hank to fire him over the telephone but earnest tub was standing in denny is office when that phone call was made
POD1000000018_S0000164	he said he saw tears in jim is eyes
POD1000000018_S0000165	hank had missed a scheduled opera appearance most likely for no good reason other than that he was drunk danny said he thought firing hank would make him realize he needed to get his act together
POD1000000018_S0000166	that is not what happened hank williams died 4 months after being dismissed from the opera it is tragic but you can see how jim denne thought he was doing the right thing in that situation
POD1000000018_S0000167	this is important to recognize because the year hank williams died is the same year that jim denny formed cedarwood publishing with web pierce
POD1000000018_S0000169	if you do not know what a publishing company is it used to be the heart of the record industry on the surface a publishing company is purpose was to make sure sales royalties were going to the right place
POD1000000018_S0000170	they took a big percentage to do this so anything that could be done to make a hit out of one of their riders songs they would do it and if they forgot to send you your whole royalty check sometimes well shit happens
POD1000000018_S0000172	rokoff and fred rose had started a rose music back in 1942
POD1000000018_S0000173	so many country writers were being screwed over by publishing companies based out of other cities that there needed to be one in nashville an honest publishing company run by country artists for country artists
POD1000000018_S0000174	they were the best game in town until jim denny formed cedar wood in 53
POD1000000018_S0000175	as head of artist services at wsm and manager of the grand opera jim denny controlled who got to play in the opera their place in the lineup and how long they got to play
POD1000000018_S0000176	can you see where this is headed
POD1000000018_S0000178	if jim denny owns a country music publishing firm while retaining singular control of the most popular country music radio program in america then he is essentially printing his own money
POD1000000018_S0000180	once he has got a writer signed to cedarwood then he is getting a huge piece of any money their songs make if that writer also wants to be a performer congratulations you are on the grand ole opera tonight
POD1000000018_S0000181	if the writer does not want to be a performer congratulations we pierce is the biggest star on the opera and he is playing your song on the grand ole opera tonight
POD1000000018_S0000182	rokoff was pissed off and he did not stay quiet about it he said danny was giving the best spots to his own artists artists sign of rose had a tendency to see roy is point
POD1000000018_S0000183	artists signed to cedar wood had a tendency to think jim denny was not doing anything wrong weird
POD1000000018_S0000184	long story short in 1956 wsm fired jim denne over his conflicts of interest
POD1000000018_S0000186	he started a booking agency and signed most of the opera artists some of whom had resigned when denny was fired then denny contacted the philip morris tobacco company
POD1000000018_S0000187	their competition in the cigarette business r j reynolds was a sponsor of the grand ole opera
POD1000000018_S0000188	so when jim denne called with a chance for them to get their product associated with all those as philip morris wrote a check big enough to fund the biggest country music package tour anyone had ever seen
POD1000000018_S0000189	half the grand old opera lineup these fans listened to every saturday night was coming to stages across america for live appearances
POD1000000018_S0000190	with philip morris paying for everything the admission was even free
POD1000000018_S0000191	it looked as though everyone was getting what they wanted until the philip morris country music show booked a stop in meridian mississippi on the same week as the 5th annual jimmy rogers memorial festival
POD1000000018_S0000192	but it was worse the philip morris show would take place on the 2nd night of the to day jimmy rogers festival
POD1000000018_S0000194	for 5 years ernest tub had worked to grow the jimmy rogers festival from scratch this is a tremendously difficult thing to do eat put in the effort to honor his idol
POD1000000018_S0000196	jim denne was not simply setting up shop across the street with some healthy competition
POD1000000018_S0000197	he brought a free show to town on the same night with half the grand old opera lineup and several big names you would have had to buy a ticket to see on the jimmy rogers event the previous night
POD1000000018_S0000198	it is hard not to see that as a giant middle finger can you imagine what would happen if coachella set up a festival 8 miles away from banner on the same weekend for free
POD1000000018_S0000199	it would crush bonaru this was such a big deal that they did not even have the jimmy rogers memorial festival the following year
POD1000000018_S0000200	they regrouped to put one on again in 1959 but carrie rogers health had already taken a turn for the worse and earnest tub was never involved with the festival again
POD1000000018_S0000202	mostly a kind man was different when he had been drinking a beer or 2 while gambling with the guys he would be fine but it was the times when he would get to drinking for a whole day or 2 or 5
POD1000000018_S0000203	mirrors would get smashed windows broken he had a thing about glass apparently
POD1000000018_S0000205	according to billy bird ernest tub is reaction to the philip morris country music show undercutting the jimmy rogers memorial festival was to get drunk and stay drunk for the better part of a week
POD1000000018_S0000206	they carded him back to nashville but he was still drinking and he was still mad as hell at jim denny
POD1000000018_S0000207	finally he called danny at home in the middle of the night to cuss him out denny said something like well if you are so mad about it then how about you just meet me down at right now and we will settle things for good
POD1000000018_S0000209	that sounded like a great plan to earn his tub he strapped on a gun belt with bullets and a 357 magnum in the holster and drove downtown in his cadillac wearing house slippers
POD1000000018_S0000210	meanwhile when jim denny had hung up the phone he simply took it back off the hook again so earnest could not call him anymore and then went back to sleep
POD1000000018_S0000212	so earnest tub is drunk off his ass with a loaded gun when he stumbles into the lobby of the national life building where wsm was located
POD1000000018_S0000213	it is close to 530 in the morning people are starting to show up for work
POD1000000018_S0000215	there is more than one version of what happened next the gun gets fired in all of them
POD1000000018_S0000217	bill williams the news director at wsm says he was walking into work when a gun shot rang out in the lobby and a bullet went over his head into the wall
POD1000000018_S0000218	he turned around you know pretty scared and saw ernest standing there in his house slippers with a revolver
POD1000000018_S0000220	when he asked ernest what the hell he was doing ernest said my god i have shot the wrong man
POD1000000018_S0000221	whether or not he has been actively trying to kill anyone we will never know for certain it seems to me like he thought he had successfully shot someone and was only upset that someone was not jim denny
POD1000000018_S0000222	either way ernest settled down after thinking he would shot an innocent person bill williams called his boss jack dewitt to tell him what happened jack told bill to take ernest home
POD1000000018_S0000223	he would have except the police had been called as soon as other employees heard a gunshot in the office building
POD1000000018_S0000225	ernest went to jail for drunk and disorderly plus carrying the weapon
POD1000000018_S0000226	it was mandatory to hold public intoxication arrestees for 3 hours
POD1000000018_S0000227	so earnest bought cigarettes for all the other inmates and sang songs with them while bill williams waited to take him home
POD1000000018_S0000229	$60 bond got him out and that was the end of that
POD1000000018_S0000231	jim denny is name was kept out of the papers though everyone in the business could read between the lines and see who ernest had wanted to shoot
POD1000000018_S0000233	the incident seems to have had no effect on ernest hub is career whatsoever apparently if all was trying to do was put a bullet in jim denny then that was fine
POD1000000018_S0000235	his career lasted into the 1980 s he was still doing over 200 dates on the road a year and he only quit in 1982 because of problems from his emphysema
POD1000000018_S0000236	in 1984 his lungs killed him just like his hero jimmy rogers
POD1000000018_S0000238	the midnight jamboree still airs every saturday night and you can still buy music from ernest is record shop or online at et record shop dot com
POD1000000018_S0000240	we are told that in 1963 ernest tub made up with jim denny before jim passed away from cancer the jim denne arts bureau stayed in business for only a few more years
POD1000000018_S0000242	jim denny was inducted to the country music hall of fame in 1966 cedarwood jim denny is publishing company was sold to metellus in 1983
POD1000000018_S0000243	ernest tube had been inducted to the country music hall of fame in 1965 while he was still alive

POD1000000018_S0000248	each episode also has a companion blog post at cocaine and rhinestones dot com go check that out for links to the books i read the video clips i watched and the music i talked about in the episode
POD1000000018_S0000250	before i get to the liner notes segment of the post show you can email any questions you have about this episode or the podcast or me or life in general to questions at cocaine and rhinestones dot com
POD1000000018_S0000251	if enough people send in questions then i will make a q and a episode to close out the 1st season all right liner notes
POD1000000018_S0000252	okay 1st of all if i did not make it clear it is impossible to overstate ernest tubbs importance to country music
POD1000000018_S0000253	aside from influencing basically everyone who matters he was one of the 1st if not in fact the 1st artist to bring an electric guitar player with him onto the grand opera stage
POD1000000018_S0000254	if you want to call it honky tonk and it happened after earnest tub it was influenced by earnest tub before i get to the story in the episode i would like to address one other thing
POD1000000018_S0000255	in the 1980 s clyde moody tried to start an alternative association to the country music hall of fame called the country music pioneer association
POD1000000018_S0000256	the cpa had a trashy newspaper that clyde essentially used to rant against the industry and print whatever shitty rumors people sent in
POD1000000018_S0000257	among these rumors was one that ernest tub died broke and alone in a cheap downtown motel shunned by the country music world he had done so much to help
POD1000000018_S0000258	this rumor is still spread as fact and i do not believe it is true
POD1000000018_S0000259	charlie luvin even has it in his autobiography which is not the only thing charlie got wrong in that book but i will talk about that another time
POD1000000018_S0000260	1st of all the source was ernest tubbs estranged wife next ernest died owning 70% of the ernest tub record shop which had multiple locations running and was very profitable at that time he was not a broken man
POD1000000018_S0000261	it is just that is not realistic
POD1000000018_S0000262	i believe ernest chose to turn visitors away because he was wasting away of emphysema and did not want anyone who loved him to have that as their last memory of him
POD1000000018_S0000263	i do not remember who it was but someone actually did get in to see him and they point blank said they wish they had not gone to see him
POD1000000018_S0000264	they could tell he was uncomfortable about it and they were uncomfortable about it and they do not like having that be their last memory of him so he was trying to avoid that
POD1000000018_S0000265	and i think justin said that people would go would try to see earnest and he would tell justin to tell them thank you but he would rather not have the company
POD1000000018_S0000266	so you know i mean the end i do not think that ernest to died you know in a sad state of affairs i think that he did
POD1000000018_S0000268	i think he did a lot for country music and i think he went out the way that he wanted to go it seems like to me okay back to ernest and jim denny
POD1000000018_S0000269	what about this story right is was that crazy it is just so many things like the the roots of country music are just growing all over this story you know you have got jim denny showing up right as the grand ole opera is becoming a thing
POD1000000018_S0000270	ernest to get in there and his throat is broken so he can not do what he wanted to do his whole life which is imitate his hero
POD1000000018_S0000271	and then his throat gets broken and so now he has got to create this new thing and he ends up influencing fucking hank williams senior and like everyone that is that is crazy it is amazing i love this story
POD1000000018_S0000272	i will not even try to pretend to remember the 1st time i heard this story it it gets around you know
POD1000000018_S0000273	at least the part about earnest to getting drunk and going down to the radio station with a gun and shooting firing off around into the wall you know
POD1000000018_S0000274	people always bring that up as an example of how wild and crazy these old guys were everybody laughs about earnest getting hauled off to jail and ultimately getting away with causing a little bit of trouble you know up boys will be boys
POD1000000018_S0000275	and nobody ever seemed to know why it happened and that is all i ever really wanted to know people would tell you the story and just like well why did he do that well i do not know who cares it is just funny like well i wanted to know so i found out
POD1000000018_S0000276	thanks to ronnie pus very well done biography on ernest tub that finally had the story for me and the big jimmy rogers festival thing why that affected earnest so deeply that was in there
POD1000000018_S0000277	the most detailed account of bill williams version of the lobby shooting was in there
POD1000000018_S0000278	i went with bill is version because he was the news director of us with a reputation for being able to throw away that day is news script and ad lib the news without making a mistake
POD1000000018_S0000279	and he was the one right in the middle of it you know he called his boss at home he went with earnest to the jail shout out jim farney everyone else just seemed like a bystander trying to get their name involved you know
POD1000000018_S0000280	like a security guard saying that he told earnest to put the gun away and earnest fired it off to dare the security guard or whatever you know i mean
POD1000000018_S0000281	no offense if you are a security guard but i have hung out with a lot of security guards and you all are full of shit so i am going with the news director guy
POD1000000018_S0000282	also i am aware there are you know different revisionist history type opinions about how well elvis presley is debut on the grand ole opera did or did not go
POD1000000018_S0000283	my thing is he did not get an encore you know that is a fact he did not get an oncor he was a special guest and special guest almost always get an encore so the fact that he did not get one
POD1000000018_S0000284	i am going with it was not good you know i do not think i do not think it was good you know
POD1000000018_S0000285	i have seen every year from 1924 to 1929 cited as the year of denny being hired at the parent company of wsm the insurance company the life insurance company i do not really care what year he you know exactly was let us see
POD1000000018_S0000286	there was a biography of johnny cash that quoted a rolling stone interview with johnny talking about jim denny making him wait outside his office for 2 hours
POD1000000018_S0000287	larry jordan is biography on jim reeves had a bunch of great information on the jim denne opera scandal i found a billboard magazine from 1956 reporting that philip morris paid over $40 for the talent on that 1st package tour
POD1000000018_S0000288	that is a mind boggling number $2356000
POD1000000018_S0000289	for probably i do not know 810 probably 10 acts on the bill that is just that is bananas
POD1000000018_S0000291	i am going to say this guy is last name wrong craig have herst have herst i do not know he wrote a book on the history of wsm called

POD1000000018_S0000294	i know i am going to keep coming back to this book for future episodes a lot of what i got out of that for this was about denny is firing because pretty much everywhere else you hear people talk about denny getting fired
POD1000000018_S0000295	they are all like yeah i do not know it was just like weird no one really knows why he got fired or you have got artists who were with cedar wood saying jim danny got railroaded

POD1000000018_S0000298	i mentioned that hank senior was heavily influenced by ernest tub but also some of the most charming stuff i have ever read about hank is the way he acted around earnest
POD1000000018_S0000299	you know they were peers they were contemporaries hank was influenced by him but then he you know got to come to the show
POD1000000018_S0000300	and be a part of the big time and you just get the idea that he was just like a kid in a candy store around ernests tub you get the the idea that he just really loved being around this guy and he could not help messing with him he was always screwing with earnest
POD1000000018_S0000301	ernest hussong walking the floor over you hank williams took that image of walking the floor and put it in your cheating heart you know you will walk the floor like i do

POD1000000018_S0000303	that clip of justin tub talking and the clip of johnny paycheck talking are both from the country family reunion dvds which are pretty much all amazing if you have never seen those
POD1000000018_S0000304	i think it is bill anderson that host them there has got to be 20 of them in a series they have always got different old school people on there sitting around talking telling stories

POD1000000018_S0000309	there is a book called andy and don with the confirmation of percy fourman inspiring matlock
POD1000000018_S0000310	percy is no longer alive and his new york times obituary had some other interesting information that i did not know
POD1000000018_S0000311	like jack ruby asked percy fourman to defend him after shooting lee harvey oswald but then there was this communication error like
POD1000000018_S0000312	jack ruby people told jack that form wanted like 5 times as much money as he ever asked from anyone or something so he was like well screw that i will go someone else
POD1000000018_S0000313	and fourman like seemed disappointed that he did not get that case so i guess he wanted that but fourman did represent martin luther king junior is assassin james earl ray
POD1000000018_S0000314	but only long enough to convince him to plead guilty so yeah james did not get away with that
POD1000000018_S0000316	0 yeah the texas defense thing i have spent a lot of time in texas and this defense thing is so effective there
POD1000000018_S0000317	i went into this episode with the understanding that that was actually a law like that is a statute on the books in texas
POD1000000018_S0000318	people who have lived in texas their whole lives believe they live in a state with a law called the he needed killing law and i know that because these people have told me that
POD1000000018_S0000319	and yeah i always just thought it was a law in texas like you can straight up murder a motherfucker if they deserve it you know if they have got it coming
POD1000000018_S0000320	you shoot them they are dead he needed killing this is still the wild west do not mess with texas
POD1000000018_S0000321	it was only after uncovering the percy foreman matlock connection that i learned that it was really just a legal defense strategy that works so incredibly well there it may as well be a law
POD1000000018_S0000323	pretty intense
POD1000000018_S0000325	i think that is it 0 next week if you are listening to this early i am just putting this up on the website and if you happen to listen to it early

POD1000000018_S0000330	see you there
POD1000000022_S0000000	hello everyone i am stephen west this is philosophize this thank you to everyone that supports the show on patreon and thank you to the people that do not support the show by going through the amazon banner you can find out more about both those things on the front page of philosophies this dot org
POD1000000022_S0000001	apologies for the voice and my lack of execution today i am just getting over a cold but it has been too long since i had graced you with my voice and i wanted to give you guys this today is episode is part 6 in a series on sartrain am i hope you love the show today
POD1000000022_S0000003	so in a culture where there is so much social currency connected to being a victim and having some burden that you carry around with you throughout your life there may be some of you out there that feel a little left out of all that maybe you are the kind of person you look at yourself you do not feel like a victim
POD1000000022_S0000004	maybe you do not sit around poised waiting to make other people aware of some bad thing that happened in the past well enough of that crazy talk get off the bench because your uncle steve is put you in the game i am here to tell you do not worry my friend you are a victim you really are
POD1000000022_S0000005	turns out we are all victims just by virtue of being born because just think for a 2nd about how horrible the world was for us when we were all babies think of what it is like being a baby
POD1000000022_S0000006	imagine going through something similar today and if you made it on the other side tell me you would not be part of some sort of advocacy group for the people that are currently going through it think about it you did not choose to be born imagine being rounded up against your will and being rocketed off to some alien planet you know nothing about
POD1000000022_S0000007	you find yourself once you get on that planet absorbed into some foreign tribe you do not speak the language you have no idea what anything is you think the remote control of their tv is food you are completely defenseless and who do you have as teachers on this journey
POD1000000022_S0000008	what just some random man and woman that happened to look like you did not go to school for this stuff being a baby being a baby is like going to the world is worst community college they do not even have teachers they just pull some random people off the street and say hey teach these kids about rocket science go
POD1000000022_S0000009	except it is worse than that we are not just learning about rocket science we are learning everything about what it is to exist how we look at other people how we look at the world how we look at ourselves within that world what i am saying is the struggle for us former babies out here was real
POD1000000022_S0000010	and i think it is safe to say that when you are living in the middle of this chaotic world as a baby just trying to figure things out no one is really blaming you for just sort of going along with a lot of the ways people were doing things around you
POD1000000022_S0000011	there is a lot to figure out and a lot of these ways we have learned to make sense of stuff are totally arbitrary lot of the ways we think about stuff have just been sort of almost by accident passed down from generation to generation philosophers realized this
POD1000000022_S0000012	and at the time sartre for over 300 years people have been pointing out how many of the ways we look at things in the western world are largely derivative from the way christianity describes being a human being
POD1000000022_S0000013	that is how entrenched religion was in the lives of people back then and that even if you have never been to church even if your family is 15 generations removed from ever having stepped foot in a church some of these things are so foundational that generation after generation of confused baby trying to figure things out
POD1000000022_S0000014	just went along with certain assumptions about existence that have their origins in christianity for example there is a certain revelatory way that a lot of people look at important crossroads in life right like for example they will say
POD1000000022_S0000015	okay so i need to choose a career path for my life i need to declare major big decision what do i do well whenever i close my eyes and think about what i want i honestly do not know what i want i can not make that big of a decision yeah i have narrowed it down to a few things
POD1000000022_S0000016	but how can i ever know
POD1000000022_S0000018	i am spending hours a day thinking about this stuff i have faith it is going to come to me someday i have faith that i am going to wake up one day something is going to happen to me some life event is going to occur
POD1000000022_S0000020	realize my calling in life in that moment people do the same thing with relationships they will say i have this vague idea up in my head of my one and only someone do not know exactly what they look like do not know exactly what they are going to be like but i am confident one day i am going to meet someone
POD1000000022_S0000021	and there is going to be this moment when i look at them and i realize they are the person i want to spend the rest of my life with people do this with anything they will do it with motivational videos on youtube one day i am going to watch the right person screaming at me to be a better person
POD1000000022_S0000022	and from then on out it is going to be easy for me to go to the gym and eat pine cones for the rest of my life in other words there is a certain revelatory way that some people look at life choices that some thinkers believe is a long lost relic of the revelatory way we used to think about the nature of existence
POD1000000022_S0000023	that a reasonable expectation to have when navigating your life is that one day you are going to wake up and there is going to be some event some miracle that you witness some transcendent moment where you realize the divinity of jesus
POD1000000022_S0000024	you have any further questions about the nature of existence just you know forward them to the pope is inbox that is a reasonable thing to expect in that world view well this is not the only example of these long lost remnants of christianity in our thinking
POD1000000022_S0000025	and another major one another one that a lot of people in today is world still use to make sense of things is the way that they look at themselves and who they are just like in christianity where yes you have a body but your true self is a soul
POD1000000022_S0000026	it is an eternal spirit hidden deep down within that body that you have an intimate access to just like that a lot of people in today is world think of their true self or the answer to the question who are you as a personality hidden deep within us that only we and our closest friends have access to
POD1000000022_S0000027	you know they will say things like sure when i am out in public i do kind of put on a mask to other people for the sake of social utility i mean i do not act like my 100% true self in the starbucks drive through
POD1000000022_S0000028	yeah i tell people things they want to hear i play the game because look fact is it is just not useful to
POD1000000022_S0000029	not to mention i do not really feel comfortable giving a 100% of my true self to the person on the starbucks drive through who am i really though well that is something i reserve for my family and my closest friends in fact even some of my closest friends do not know everything about the depths of what it is to be me
POD1000000022_S0000030	maybe for some of you out there there is only one other person in this entire world that has full access to your true self hidden deep within you but sarra would say is this really how the self works
POD1000000022_S0000031	is the self really like the christian soul hidden somewhere deep within you that only you have access to carter would say it very well may be that you put on a mask when you go out in public for the sake of pragmatism and it very well may be that you have reflected on yourself
POD1000000022_S0000032	and you have this idea up in your head of who you are that is only accessed by you and your closest friends but do not ignore the possibility that there are multiple levels of deception going on there maybe you are telling yourself a story you want to hear the same way you are telling the starbucks barista story
POD1000000022_S0000033	this concept is a common one in existentialism it is actually one of the main themes in dostoyevsky is book crime and punishment the idea that you know we often think we know a lot more about ourselves than we actually do in practice 2 examples of this
POD1000000022_S0000034	bear with me for a 2nd on the 1st one it is a little cartoonish but i think it is a really good example to pull us out of this conditioned way we often look at the self and it gets us to honestly start asking this question where is this self that we are talking about really located
POD1000000022_S0000035	1st example imagine a guy that thinks he is napoleon you know he spends all day every day dressing up in parisian military garb he builds a bunker out of couch cushions in his front room agonizing to himself how am i going to conquer moscow
POD1000000022_S0000036	that guy now this man believes beyond a shadow of a doubt that he is napoleon if you sat him down and you asked him candidly no but who are you really deep down inside he would say i am napoleon bonaparte commander of the armies of the north
POD1000000022_S0000037	husband to a murdered wife father to a murdered son and i will have my vengeance but is this man really napoleon we know he is not napoleon in fact in a weird way as outsiders we seem to have an advantage when it comes to knowing who he really is
POD1000000022_S0000038	interesting here is the less cartoonish example and try to think about how this applies to you imagine a guy sitting on the couch watching tv with his pals they turn on the news and there is a story about some mass shooting that happened at a walmart somewhere
POD1000000022_S0000039	he hears the story gets kind of angry turns to his friends and says you know what that guy and people like him the better hope they never show up at my walmart someone pulls out a gun when i am there i am not going to be one of those people on the news chopper camera screaming and running out of the store
POD1000000022_S0000040	i am going to the sporting goods section i am going to go up into the rafters like i am tom cruise and snap the dude is neck i am going to do this because that is just the kind of person i am that is me i would sacrifice my life for the greater good now he may tell his friends this
POD1000000022_S0000041	he may believe that that is who he is deep down beyond a shadow of a doubt but if next saturday he is out shopping with his family someone pulls out a gun and all his wife and kids see is a poof of smoke and then he is running out the back door who is that guy really
POD1000000022_S0000042	in other words when we reference this thing we call ourself intuitively it can feel like well i am myself i know who i am so no one can tell me who i am but me
POD1000000022_S0000043	in fact if you just recited that statement in most public settings people would be like yeah yeah you tell him only you know who you are deep down inside but is that a delusion is that just a narrative that we tell ourselves to simplify this concept of the self
POD1000000022_S0000044	sartre says that when you take a closer look at the self it is not a soul it is not a personality hidden deep within you what we are referencing when we talk about the self turns out to be much more complex than that with many more moving parts
POD1000000022_S0000045	and i think a good place to begin if we want to understand sartre is views on what the self really is is to talk about 2 foundational aspects of what it means to be a human being that the artra seemed to be constantly intertwined and dependent upon each other what he calls or facticity
POD1000000022_S0000046	and our transcendence if you are a human being that is alive right now you have both facticity and transcendence put very simply our facticity is the collection of facts that are true about us at any given moment
POD1000000022_S0000047	and transcendence is our ability to change the possibilities that we have at our disposal let us break it down further though remember last time when we talked about being in itself versus being for itself being in itself as being kind of like matter this inert featureless blob of existence
POD1000000022_S0000048	fully affirmative and being for itself as being consciousness or the source of all negation well one day when she was trying to meet his monthly quota for obscure sounding philosophical descriptions the way he describes the relationship between these 2 ontological categories is that being in itself
POD1000000022_S0000049	is what it is and being for itself quote is what it is not well as weird as that sounds in a vacuum after listening to last episode we all know what he means when he says it but then carter points out something very mysterious a very strange coincidence
POD1000000022_S0000050	when you look at the relationship between these 2 ontological categories 2 things that are easy to write off as just these meaningless abstract concepts that start to cook up one day when you look at how being in itself and being for itself relate to each other
POD1000000022_S0000051	carter notices there seems to be a similar sort of relationship at the foundation of who we are as people see because on one hand all of us have our facticity and facticity is kind of like being in itself it is the fully affirmative set of facts that are true about us
POD1000000022_S0000052	you ask me who i am and oftentimes i will state the facts about myself 0 i am 117 years old that is a fact i am a horse wrangler by profession that is a fact i make $28000 a year i drive afford focus
POD1000000022_S0000053	i am scared of spiders things like that right in other words statements of facts that are currently true about us that is what makes up our facticity but what sartre would want us to consider is that while these kinds of statements are no doubt useful when it comes to describing certain pieces of who i am
POD1000000022_S0000054	they never tell us the full story and the reason why is because human beings are far more complex than that to fully understand a human being just by default is to understand a type of being that has possibilities none of us are pure facticity in other words
POD1000000022_S0000055	the only time a human being is pure facticity is when they are dead yes we have a set of facts that are true about us right now but we always have the ability to change into something else and if we are trying to describe the self if we are trying to look at the whole picture of who someone is
POD1000000022_S0000056	the choices we make about which of these possibilities we are going to bring about end up being just as important as the facts about who we are right now for example if i am going to school to become an it consultant or if i am training for a marathon or if i am losing a bunch of weight for wedding pictures
POD1000000022_S0000057	a big part of understanding who i am is understanding the thing i am actively trying to change into an it consultant a marathon runner in other words part of understanding the full picture of me is understanding what i am not yet
POD1000000022_S0000058	you can start to hear the weird state description creeping in there just like being in itself is what it is and being for itself is what it is not in a sense i am what i am i have facticity but i also am what i am not yet
POD1000000022_S0000059	when i consider my transcendence just like being in itself and being for itself these 2 aspects of what it is to be a human being facticity and transcendence are entangled intertwined and in some cases reliant on each other for their very existence
POD1000000022_S0000060	your facticity and transcendence are constantly affecting each other and that is because the facts of your life are oftentimes caused by what possibilities you decide to bring about and the possibilities you have decided to explore are almost always limited by the facts of your life
POD1000000022_S0000061	let us stop at the hypotheticals and just give a real example right me i will use me as an example i am 6 feet tall £172.2 this morning now no matter how much i want to
POD1000000022_S0000062	i am never going to become a horse jockey is just not going to happen for me as long as there is people out there that are 4 foot £885 the facticity that i am a certain height and weight limits my ability to transcend and the result of that is
POD1000000022_S0000063	i have never been in the kentucky derby it is not happening this is an example of how our ability to transcend is oftentimes limited by the facts about us another example i was born with a particular face and a particular ability to put on muscle
POD1000000022_S0000064	no matter how much i want to i am never going to be an instagram model the facticity of my face my my facticity all the other stuff going on there
POD1000000022_S0000065	look i will never be the kind of person that people want to voluntarily look at and then click an emoji that signifies how they are feeling about the most recent picture of me is just not going to happen and these facts about me are the parameters i live my life and exercise my freedom within see because that is the thing and this goes for all of you out there
POD1000000022_S0000066	when sartre talks about radical freedom when any of us talk about being individuals that are free to act as they choose we are never talking about total freedom right it is always freedom within certain limitations
POD1000000022_S0000067	you know we often say things like i can do whatever i want to do but you can not really do anything you want to do right i mean ultimately you are a human being you can not wrap yourself in a protective cocoon and then merge a unicorn in 3 days you can not fly to the edge of the universe and look what is on the other side
POD1000000022_S0000068	no freedom is always freedom within certain limitations and it is those limitations that give a lot of what you choose to do in life its value we see this in all the various different forms of art you know when someone writes a really good high
POD1000000022_S0000069	we see it as good not because they are the greatest words that have ever been possibly strung together now the beauty of a high c is because we understand that we have given an artist total freedom within a set of limitations that we impose
POD1000000022_S0000070	5 syllables 7 syllables 5 syllables go in other words the limitations are a big part of what makes the haik beautiful and this applies to life as well
POD1000000022_S0000071	the facticity that you were born into your own individual limitations are always going to affect the possibilities that you have and what you ultimately chose to do with your life so try to live your life like it is a piece of art you are creating
POD1000000022_S0000072	but yeah ultimately the point starts making here with the concept of facticity and transcendence is not only to stop thinking about yourself as though it is this artifact hidden deep within you inside of a vault but also stop thinking about who you are as though it is this static
POD1000000022_S0000073	unchanging thing that you can point to the point that he is making is that who you are is always in a state of constant change sometimes small changes sometimes bigger changes but changing and in flux but do not go extreme in the other direction
POD1000000022_S0000074	do not start thinking of yourself as this ethereal thing that can never be defined again all the way up until the day you die when you are finally turned into total facticity you will always have certain facts that are true about you and certain possibilities at your disposal to bring about
POD1000000022_S0000075	unless if you are dead you have never arrived at a destination as a human being now at 1st glance this may seem like artra is writing a self help book no no single fact about you sums up who you are release your inner transcendence no
POD1000000022_S0000076	no like we touched on last time sartor thinks that when people are truly faced with the number of these possibilities they are free to choose from most of the time they do not get excited they are horrified by it in fact most of the time once people realize this stuff
POD1000000022_S0000077	sartre thinks that the secret covert desire of everyone whether they realize it or not is to escape this duality it is to turn themselves into either pure facticity or pure transcendence or sartre says we all secretly want to become god
POD1000000022_S0000078	let us talk about what he means by that think about the way followers of the abrahamic religions have traditionally looked at god what is it like to be god well god is perfect god is in this moment everything he will ever be if god had a job interview and the person asked him what is one thing you change about yourself
POD1000000022_S0000079	god literally does not have an answer to that question but then on the other hand god is all powerful with the snap of his fingers he can do anything he wants to do in other words in this old style traditional view of what god is on one hand
POD1000000022_S0000080	god is perfect as he is pure facticity but on the other hand god is all powerful and capable of bringing about any possibility he wants in other words pure transcendence sort would say this is no coincidence
POD1000000022_S0000081	and it is also no coincidence that as people navigate their lives they have all sorts of tactics they use to turn themselves either into somebody that ignores their possibilities and are perfect as they are right now or someone who ignores the very real unfortunate facts about themselves
POD1000000022_S0000082	and they stay lost in these unattainable dreams their entire life this is the context we needed to understand a concept we talked about well over a year ago on the one episode we did on sarra the primary tactic that people use in their lives to turn themselves into either pure facticity
POD1000000022_S0000083	or pure transcendence like god is what sartre calls bad faith let us take a look at the most famous example of bad faith that sartre lays out and because we already talked about the other episode i will keep it brief
POD1000000022_S0000084	sartre talks about sitting in the middle of a cafe in paris watching a water as he does his job now you can imagine a water in the 1940 s right dressed up in his little outfit very upright good posture very proper
POD1000000022_S0000085	he holds the tray in a particular way he walks and changes direction in a very militaristic particular way like a good water does carter can not help but point out that this guy does not seem to be a self with facticity and transcendence in this moment
POD1000000022_S0000086	he seems to have relegated himself to just playing the part of a waiter he is going through the motions trying to turn himself into pure facticity just a waiter and nothing else now even though waters do not act like this often in today is world
POD1000000022_S0000087	go to most restaurants and you can find some modern version of what starts talking about here i mean there is so many servers out there that have fallen into bad faith and are just sort of playing the role of the same person it seems to be a modern archetype of what it is to be a server they all say the same stuff
POD1000000022_S0000088	hi i am john i am going to be taking care of you today can i get you guys started with a bottomless bucket of shrimp or some drinks or something but it is at every stage of the meal how is everything tasted for you guys all save room for dessert now there is absolutely no rush i am going to leave the check here i am going to go over there
POD1000000022_S0000090	ask yourself is this the way this guy talks to his mom is this the way he talks to his best friends no he is fallen into bad faith and is just playing the part of a server now the point carter is making is not that waiters need to be more creative it is not about waiters
POD1000000022_S0000091	sartor thinks that as human beings we have a tendency to gravitate towards this trap in all aspects of our life we make proclamations about what we are all the time i am a stay at home mom that is my identity
POD1000000022_S0000092	i am a libertarian i am a mormon and that is that what we are desperately trying to do with these proclamations is give ourselves an essence in a world where existence precedes essence
POD1000000022_S0000093	all these things are just us wanting to think about ourselves as some static thing set in stone and run from the possibilities that we have no when we take an honest look at the possibilities at our disposal it terrifies us and it produces a feeling called nausea
POD1000000022_S0000094	and we use bad faith to quell this feeling of nausea we are constantly doing this with ourselves now if all you ever read was sartre is being in nothingness you might get the read from the book that this tendency we have to gravitate towards bad faith
POD1000000022_S0000095	is an inescapable condition of being a human being and that even when we are self aware of the bad faith we are engaging in we are still engaging in bad faith if all you ever read was the main text of being in nothingness you might get that impression and it certainly sounds like a really sad picture
POD1000000022_S0000096	but in one of the footnotes of being in nothingness cartera alludes to a way out of all of it and perhaps to an ethic that he would write later on in his life well he never writes in ethics and it may be because you know his lifelong partner
POD1000000022_S0000097	and fellow existentialist simone de bava produces what many consider to be the greatest existentialist approach to ethics called the ethics of ambiguity next episode is part 2 on simone bava were going to be talking all about it but enough of bad faith let us get back to answering this question who am i
POD1000000022_S0000098	really here is the thing when it comes to these concepts of facticity and transcendence we have been talking about we just think generally about the facts that are true about you and the possibilities that you have where are those things located where are you looking to find those
POD1000000022_S0000099	those things are not hidden somewhere deep down within you that only you have access to you may have a particular perspective of the facts that are true about you and the possibilities that you have but not only do you have an incentive to slip into bad faith and tell yourself a story about them
POD1000000022_S0000100	carter would say you do not have some privileged vip access to the facts that are true about you and the possibilities that you have i mean hypothetically any other person if they were diligent enough has access to your facticity and transcendence
POD1000000022_S0000101	in fact just like the guy that tells himself that he is napoleon sometimes other people are better at telling us who we are than we are but how is this possible the reason it is possible is because the self is not the christian soul to sara
POD1000000022_S0000102	just like your facticity and transcendence what we are referencing when we talk about ourselves is outside of us it is an abstraction it is the conglomeration of all the things you have ever actually done in your life
POD1000000022_S0000103	when you want to get a solid answer to the question who am i you do not reference the story that you tell yourself in your head that is clouded by all sorts of bad faith and wishful thinking like the guy that thinks he would try to take down the gunman at walmart
POD1000000022_S0000104	no we tell ourselves stories all the time what follows from this is that the true measure of your values the true measure of who you are is what you actually do it is the collection of what you have actually done thus far in your life and art says that when you stop looking at the self
POD1000000022_S0000105	as though it is this thing inside of you and you start looking at it more accurately as this abstraction that is outside of us what you inevitably start to realize is that it is impossible to ever get a full picture of who you are without referencing the way that other people view you
POD1000000022_S0000106	more than that it is impossible to ever get a full picture of being without referencing other people and i mean here is what he is getting at so far when it comes to describing being we have been presented with being in itself and being for itself but it is right here fairly late in being
POD1000000022_S0000107	nothingness that sartre lays out his 3rd ontological category what he calls being for others let us talk about what he means carter would say that an intrinsic part of what it is to be you is existing alongside other people and all the consequences that come along with that
POD1000000022_S0000108	this is sartre is concept of being for others now how does being for others affect my answer to the question who am i well again this concept of the self is outside of us it is an abstraction
POD1000000022_S0000109	and what sartre points out is that there are many aspects about who we are that are given to us by other people for example whether we are trustworthy or not whether or not you are a trustworthy person is an aspect of who you are that is mediated by other people right
POD1000000022_S0000110	whether i am a nice or mean person look i may think of myself as a nice person but if every single other person i encounter all throughout my life says that i am mean for all intents and purposes i am a mean person this concept of the self
POD1000000022_S0000111	and how other people view us seem to be connected to artra but the flip side of it being that interconnected is that it leaves us in what he describes as a perpetual state of being judged by the people around us
POD1000000022_S0000112	we are almost always being turned into pure facticity in other people is minds for example if you ever walked around and you are self conscious about the way you look maybe you just got a new pair of shoes and you think they look weird and as you are walking around you feel like every person that passes you is looking at you and they are thinking
POD1000000022_S0000113	wow what were they thinking when they picked out those shoes this is obviously a person that does not care very much about the way that they look in other words they are looking at you and they are turning you into an object and their subjective view of the world pure facticity
POD1000000022_S0000114	you will henceforth be known as the weird shoes guy in that person is mind this is constantly going on but that is not saying it is always bad that being around other people is some paranoid everybody is thinking bad things about me all the time thing
POD1000000022_S0000115	people very well may be thinking really good things about you all the time the point that sartre wants to make is that this whole dynamic this dynamic of other people seeing you putting you on trial and turning you into pure facticity in their minds this is going on all the time
POD1000000022_S0000116	simply by virtue of the fact that we exist alongside other people and that while the insights other people give us about who we are are no doubt valuable we have to be careful not to slip into bad faith on either side of this dynamic of being for others what i mean is
POD1000000022_S0000117	just because somebody sees you wearing weird shoes one day does not mean that you are now weird shoes guy in perpetuity in other words do not slip into bad faith when it comes to what other people think about you no matter how convenient it may be to prescribe yourself an essence and deny your transcendence
POD1000000022_S0000118	do not turn yourself into pure facticity and just accept what other people tell you you are maybe you are weird shoes guy right now but you do not have to be in the future but the other side of that is do not deny your facticity do not tell yourself your shoes are fine
POD1000000022_S0000119	do not tell yourself that you do not care what anyone else says or that what other people think does not matter to you at all obviously it does that is slipping into another kind of bad faith
POD1000000022_S0000120	so to sum this up i guess look intuitively
POD1000000022_S0000121	it may seem to us like we have a sort of special access to knowing who we are and that we choose to share ourselves with only our closest friends who we trust dearly but carter would say that the reason it seems that way is because what you actually have is a narrative about yourself
POD1000000022_S0000123	perspective and the reason it seems like your friends reinforce this picture of who you are
POD1000000022_S0000124	is because that is the very criteria we all use to choose who our friends are going to be is whether or not they reinforce this picture that we have of ourselves that is what we like about our friends to sartre
POD1000000022_S0000125	for example if a big part of the way that you view yourself and your identity is that you consider yourself to be a smart person sartre would predict that most of your friends are going to be people that are not so smart that tell you you are smart all the time
POD1000000022_S0000126	or people that ask you a lot of questions that you then answer making you feel smart or other smart people that commend you on being smart like them to sarra we choose our friends because they reinforce the way that we view ourselves
POD1000000022_S0000127	of course we would give them privileged access to our biased narrative of ourselves
POD1000000022_S0000128	and of course it is going to feel validating of course it would seem that you know better than anyone else who you are but again sartre would say that the true measure of your values the true answer to the question who are you
POD1000000022_S0000129	is what you actually do thank you for listening i will talk to you next time
POD1000000025_S0000000	there is sort of like a before we met and after we met and no gradient
POD1000000025_S0000001	
POD1000000025_S0000002	
POD1000000025_S0000003	like i do not even know this guy and then this is the person i work with on every
POD1000000025_S0000004	i am pretty sure this and i was like this is my best friend
POD1000000025_S0000006	i am david diggs
POD1000000025_S0000007	i am raphael casa
POD1000000025_S0000008	everbody
POD1000000025_S0000010	it is a little hard to summarize the partnership between david and raphael because as best friends and creative collaborators they have done so much over the years together
POD1000000025_S0000011	let me start individually david did won a tony and a grammy for his performance in hamilton
POD1000000025_S0000012	he played thomas jefferson and the marquis de lafayette in the original broadway cast
POD1000000025_S0000013	he is also the vocalist in the experimental hip hop group clipping
POD1000000025_S0000014	raphael kasal is an actor writer and director he is an award winning slam poet and started appearing on hbo is deaf poetry jam at the age of 18
POD1000000025_S0000015	over the 20 years these guys have known each other they have worked in theater poetry music and film and usually in some combination of those mediums
POD1000000025_S0000016	they co wrote and co starred in the film blind spotting which premiered at the sundance film festival in 2018
POD1000000025_S0000017	and president obama named it one of his favorite movies of the year
POD1000000025_S0000018	blind spotting takes place in oakland which is also where david and raphael are from
POD1000000025_S0000019	their story begins at berkeley high school here is david
POD1000000025_S0000021	i am not sure when we met when we were formally introduced but surely at some sort of poetry event because we were both sort of coming up in that scene
POD1000000025_S0000022	i was older 4 years older than him
POD1000000025_S0000023	my freshman year his senior year that is a lifetime apart in high school
POD1000000025_S0000024	my memory of him in high school is like i always had like a very nonchalant way about him
POD1000000025_S0000025	and i do not know that this paints it accurately but this is a representation is like at some point i was like i am just wearing pajama pants school every day
POD1000000025_S0000026	and i am sure that was not the whole time i got this little window
POD1000000025_S0000027	it was the whole time all of high school for sure
POD1000000025_S0000029	that is amazing
POD1000000025_S0000030	it was like as a rule but we would see each other at these poetry events and he was really really good at writing poems
POD1000000025_S0000031	like a way more sort of focused writer than i had ever been in that situation you know
POD1000000025_S0000032	so i remember that i remember thinking that here is a person that is actually better than me at this thing
POD1000000025_S0000033	and that is pretty cool
POD1000000025_S0000034	then over the years also after when i was in college i would come back home for the summer sometimes i would drop in just to watch like poetry things that were happening or sort of check in on the scene
POD1000000025_S0000035	and he was like the dude he had like become that guy
POD1000000025_S0000036	i remember that so differently
POD1000000025_S0000038	like barely finished high school in a very in a very nontraditional way and then went off and did this show on hbo deaf poetry
POD1000000025_S0000040	this just new perspective for today is youth all ladies aint thin enough fellows aint trim enough
POD1000000025_S0000041	want to be sexy i do not go to the gym enough cut to commercial
POD1000000025_S0000042	came back and had just enough money saved up with some friends to open a very dungeon recording studio and we were looking for other artists we did not have anybody else recording at the studio
POD1000000025_S0000043	and so a mutual friend of ours one of his close friends who was the older brother of one of my close friends was like you know david raps
POD1000000025_S0000044	yeah we really got set up on like a rapper playdate
POD1000000025_S0000045	so our friend justin was like you guys should work together you are 2 of my favorite rapper
POD1000000025_S0000046	i was like yeah yeah and you played me stuff and it was really good
POD1000000025_S0000047	i did not have anywhere record i was recording songs in my mom is closet in the little closet in my room
POD1000000025_S0000048	i have not been in a lot of studio spaces so i was studio
POD1000000025_S0000049	i do not know that this qualified as an actual
POD1000000025_S0000050	know that
POD1000000025_S0000051	i have not been there
POD1000000025_S0000052	but i do not think we had any idea like what meeting each other and actually getting time was going to be like
POD1000000025_S0000053	finally we started it was like this is the song we are going to
POD1000000025_S0000054	listen through some beats and i was like let us work on this one
POD1000000025_S0000055	i just started writing and yeah it happened really fast
POD1000000025_S0000056	and at some point we looked up and everyone else was gone and it was just the 2 of us in there we were still making music
POD1000000025_S0000058	just made music until the sun came up and like began the ritual that day of like going to the car at 8 a m
POD1000000025_S0000059	and playing everything that you recorded and then like dragging your body home to sleep and kind of doing it all over again
POD1000000025_S0000061	i have been making music for many many years and it had never been that much fun before
POD1000000025_S0000062	suddenly there is this person that like writes a verse in 5 minutes and can nail it in a take
POD1000000025_S0000063	and at the time we were like working with some random singers and so i could not ever sing the line and rappers who took like an hour to get a verse down
POD1000000025_S0000064	it was just like wow this is so easy and then we just have songs done
POD1000000025_S0000065	we always joke about is like there is sort of like a before we met and after we met and no gradient
POD1000000025_S0000066	
POD1000000025_S0000068	i do not even know this guy and then this is the person i work with
POD1000000025_S0000069	every
POD1000000025_S0000070	i am pretty sure this was like this is my best friend
POD1000000025_S0000072	like
POD1000000025_S0000074	as a young artist early on when i am still trying to figure things out and creating is hard for me being around somebody who just creates all the time addictive
POD1000000025_S0000075	i do not have the technical skill set that rape has so like he was so fast and proto
POD1000000025_S0000076	so all of these things that i just i would have to labor over and then all of that stuff became really impressive too
POD1000000025_S0000077	once you know as we started working together and i became aware that he had taught himself all of these things like nobody ever really showed him how to do anything it seemed like
POD1000000025_S0000078	and he was editing videos and shooting things you know the whole range of what it takes to be a music artist like out in the world he had taught himself to do
POD1000000025_S0000079	i did not really know anybody like that
POD1000000025_S0000080	you know over the next 4 or 5 years we recorded
POD1000000025_S0000082	no one will ever hear
POD1000000025_S0000084	it 100s
POD1000000025_S0000085	and wrote a play together and then we lived together and it was like 0
POD1000000025_S0000086	when we are around each other this much it is like we have too many ideas
POD1000000025_S0000087	it was like the the right amount of proximity for like the full version of creativity that we had always
POD1000000025_S0000088	we thought we would already tapped it and we like did so much shit that year
POD1000000025_S0000089	
POD1000000025_S0000090	artistically we are doing great
POD1000000025_S0000091	were definitely making it and we were definitely broke
POD1000000025_S0000093	thing it was like
POD1000000025_S0000094	got on the radio
POD1000000025_S0000095	this is also great listen how he says we at this one really rape was known
POD1000000025_S0000096	he had a song that got played on like clear channel radio and then got named like one of the bay area freshmen tents like
POD1000000025_S0000097	best new whatever
POD1000000025_S0000098	he got named one of those but rave never would take that for himself and it was always like us
POD1000000025_S0000099	we are and so like we played those shows together and like we would end up making no money on these gig
POD1000000025_S0000100	because he would bring me and a band like 4 or 5 other people to play music use the entire feed to fly us out to wherever georgia and like play a show where no one would make any money but we got to play a show
POD1000000025_S0000101	he was like doing that from jump for so long
POD1000000025_S0000102	why was that how you would always do it
POD1000000025_S0000103	well because i do not i am uncomfortable with a statement
POD1000000025_S0000105	berkley
POD1000000025_S0000108	
POD1000000025_S0000110	feel self indulgent
POD1000000025_S0000112	was raised to not feed an ego that feels constantly eager for food
POD1000000025_S0000114	what i love about that period is like we are all pushing to little different degrees of success
POD1000000025_S0000115	we are just kind of weirdos like almost in a scene that we kind of make sense in
POD1000000025_S0000116	they did not understand is very much at all i feel like the more commercial bay area scene
POD1000000025_S0000117	and they only sort of understood me like it was very like yeah you are in but like do not try to make any changes you know
POD1000000025_S0000118	and i think that is a big reason that we went to l a
POD1000000025_S0000119	we can see the top of the ladder and it is not getting any friendlier or more receptive
POD1000000025_S0000120	and we maybe could make this movie and maybe there is like different music opportunities down there but it is definitely not going to happen here
POD1000000025_S0000121	and then suddenly we like packed up from the west oakland place and moved to l a
POD1000000025_S0000122	also we had already been we were working on blind spotting and so we had been traveling up and down
POD1000000025_S0000123	our producers we had been driving to meet with them really frequently
POD1000000025_S0000124	we were slumming it so hard when we got to we were so poor i was delivering taco
POD1000000025_S0000125	i was like i could not be an actor in la is what i decided
POD1000000025_S0000126	we are just like swinging and missing
POD1000000025_S0000128	just trying to figure out like what does it mean to be in the bigger pond and like want to be artists professionally
POD1000000025_S0000129	and we did 5 years in l before i went to new york to do hamilton
POD1000000025_S0000130	i think that was one of those things that came about for digs really organically
POD1000000025_S0000131	hamilton was such an interesting like us like it was a play that was like legit written for him to flex all the things he is good at
POD1000000025_S0000132	they were like who is this like rap kid that like turns out can also act
POD1000000025_S0000133	the rest of us were like turns out like he has been doing that more than a lot of you know
POD1000000025_S0000134	then the world saw digs in the light that best showed everything and they not only accepted but obsessed over it
POD1000000025_S0000135	and then i went to visit him in new york when the show was picking up steam
POD1000000025_S0000136	and the 1st thing that happened is this girl grabs my arm and looks at digs and goes 0 my god is that dave digs to me
POD1000000025_S0000137	like start to realize that this woman is anne hathaway like and she is like fan girling out
POD1000000025_S0000138	and i am like 0 man like a major shift is happening
POD1000000025_S0000139	my life is changing very very quickly i was under stress constantly
POD1000000025_S0000140	rafis like calling and texting and emailing and i am like getting back to the degree that i can
POD1000000025_S0000141	and so like yes obviously it would have been like so much easier and nicer if my best friend was also living in new york and somebody who has context for me outside of this thing
POD1000000025_S0000142	i remember like somebody turned and i was like i am thinking about moving to new york so you will respond more in person
POD1000000025_S0000143	he digs goes i did not want to ask
POD1000000025_S0000145	that is like a big ask and like i am doing 8 shows a week now like move to new york and like let us go kick it in the berkshires
POD1000000025_S0000146	you know like like new york and i will see you like at midnight sometimes
POD1000000025_S0000147	but i was like well it is just good for him to have a friend there but also like can i run your social media
POD1000000025_S0000149	you are not posting enough and like people want to see this adventure and like there is a sincere way to do it
POD1000000025_S0000150	i had done like a little bit of it with his twitter and stuff in the bay and in la but like this was like give me your passwords i probably already had them
POD1000000025_S0000152	an admission that he was going
POD1000000025_S0000154	and i was like yeah i do that
POD1000000025_S0000155	especially if you actually even have to do
POD1000000025_S0000157	self indulgent i am doing it
POD1000000025_S0000159	you know like like there is like a year of his instagram that is just his friend is version of how awesome it is
POD1000000025_S0000161	
POD1000000025_S0000162	spotting got started because around when i was 211 of my friends got killed in a way that sort of did not make a lot of sense to most people in the community
POD1000000025_S0000163	and it was sort of like the breaking point because it was a woman because it was somebody like was not really involved in the violence of the world that we were existing in at the time
POD1000000025_S0000164	some other people have been killed other people i sort of was close to there is a series of funerals people had gone to like in succession
POD1000000025_S0000165	and this was the button on it it was just like a breaking point for me
POD1000000025_S0000166	and so i would written this poem about sort of like the numbness of that experience of like god is this like what life is
POD1000000025_S0000167	people die and we get numb and we care a little less every time like how does this go
POD1000000025_S0000168	and then we just kind of started coming up with a story that was a movie that is in verse starting the 2 of us
POD1000000025_S0000169	we kept almost making blind spotting and not making it
POD1000000025_S0000170	digs he finishes this massive sensation in new york he had like 30 days in june that he could shoot this movie
POD1000000025_S0000171	22
POD1000000025_S0000172	and then a month later we were in oakland shooting the movie
POD1000000025_S0000173	in the hometown like everybody who is an extra in that movie is a friend of ours that we grew up with
POD1000000025_S0000174	and it is still not a real movie to us it is still a thing we can not believe they made
POD1000000025_S0000175	in hollywood in a world that we always assumed we did not belong in you know that we never really figured out how we would fit into anyway
POD1000000025_S0000176	to have doors start opening in a way where they are sort of asking questions about what you want to do is crazy actually

POD1000000025_S0000180	and i still know the 10 things that he can do that nobody is seen yet and that is still fun for me
POD1000000025_S0000181	the closest i have ever gotten to fighting with rave i think is like when somebody else i am close to is fighting with rap
POD1000000025_S0000182	i think that is sort of our good cook
POD1000000025_S0000183	someone will be like venting to him and he is like i do not know what to tell you i have already picked my team

POD1000000027_S0000009	from espn you are listening to 30 for 30 podcast my name is jody avirgan welcome to our 5th season of original audio documentaries as we have done before we are devoting the entire season to one story it is told over 5 parts
POD1000000027_S0000011	it is about a scandal that rocked the nba and tells us a lot about how power race and celebrity intersect in modern sports
POD1000000027_S0000013	for this season we are excited to work with espn is ramona shelburne one of our top nba reporters and a native and someone who has been covering this story from the moment it broke
POD1000000027_S0000014	ramona is your host for all 5 episodes a quick word of warning this season contains mature subject matter and language and now coming up after the break from 30 for 30 and the undefeated the sterling affairs
POD1000000027_S0000016	shelly sterling thought she was just going to return some clothes to neiman marcus when she got in her mercedes benz station wagon and made the drive from malibu to beverly hills it was early in the spring of 2014
POD1000000027_S0000017	and even though shelley was almost 80 years old she was still going into town as rich people call beverly hills 4 or 5 days a week it is hard to guess shelley is age if you do not know it
POD1000000027_S0000018	because she keeps her hair this convincing pale blond and her face is very well maintained driving into beverly hills is basically like entering a state park for the rich and famous
POD1000000027_S0000019	there are the iconic brown and yellow signs that let you know you have entered a special place and shelly sterling and her husband donald own a ton of it
POD1000000027_S0000020	over their 60 year marriage the sterlings built a real estate empire in their heyday they were the largest residential landlords in la county
POD1000000027_S0000022	but most people knew her husband donald sterling as the longtime owner of the los angeles clippers one of the worst owners in all of sports his team was the laughing stock of the nba for decades
POD1000000027_S0000023	for shelley it should have been would have been just a jot down rodeo drive to return some wildly expensive clothes but unbeknown to her her husband was also at neiman marcus that day
POD1000000027_S0000024	with a woman 49 years his junior named vivian she was not the 1st mistress not even close but was something different
POD1000000027_S0000026	shelley told me that story when we met in the winter of 2019 at the beverly hills plaza hotel or by hotel as she calls it
POD1000000027_S0000027	sally was 84 at the time but she can tell that story of that run in with donald and 5 years earlier with exacting detail
POD1000000027_S0000028	i happened to be there to return something and she was there with donald and with some other friends and we had a big confrontation she was very very very nasty and mean to me
POD1000000027_S0000029	what happened was that she ran into shelley i think at norton and they started talking and i guess things got out of hand
POD1000000027_S0000030	that is aviano is lawyer mcneary and when i told shelly sterling his version of the story she scoffed
POD1000000027_S0000031	it was at neiman marcus
POD1000000027_S0000032	at 1st i thought it was funny that shelly took the time to correct him i mean here is a woman talking to a female reporter about her husband is infidelity who cares whether you confront your husband is mistress outside of nieman marcus or not
POD1000000027_S0000033	but the details matter here it is important to get it right because that meeting outside of neiman marcus that petty squabble between a wife and her husband is mistress set off a chain of events
POD1000000027_S0000034	that in the end led to one of the biggest scandals in professional sports a controversy that forced the nba to finally deal with donald sterling after decades of his bad behavior and had ripple effects throughout the entire league
POD1000000027_S0000036	this is the sterling affairs from 30 for 30 podcast and the undefeated i am ramona shelburne
POD1000000027_S0000039	i have covered basketball in la for a long time the nba is a league of huge personalities and even bigger egos fighting for power and if you want the real score that is the game you have to follow
POD1000000027_S0000041	i learned pretty quickly that there is no other owner in basketball with quite the same personality or ego as donald sterling sterling was not a basketball guy he was a personal injury lawyer and then he got filthy rich off of real estate
POD1000000027_S0000043	that is what he was really good at
POD1000000027_S0000045	i could never understand why he even kept the clippers when his reputation as an owner was so bad but that is because i always assume that deep down he wanted what everyone in the game is supposed to want to win
POD1000000027_S0000047	but rich people like donald sterling multibillion dollar rich people do not live in the same world as the rest of us do not play by the same rules when you have enough money it is like your rubber everything just bounces off of you
POD1000000027_S0000048	even 3 decades of driving an nba franchise into the ground when you are as rich as donald and shelley you get to tell yourself that everything is fabulous
POD1000000027_S0000049	i feel fabulous
POD1000000027_S0000050	they are fabulous
POD1000000027_S0000051	fabulous
POD1000000027_S0000052	he was just so fabulous
POD1000000027_S0000053	i was born and raised in la and i have never heard anyone use the word fabulous as much as these 2 do
POD1000000027_S0000054	they were fabulous it was just fabulous
POD1000000027_S0000055	even their court battles
POD1000000027_S0000056	i want to thank everybody who has helped me and my attorneys they were fabulous
POD1000000027_S0000057	and of course anything related to the team
POD1000000027_S0000058	and the u s team that won it all the fabulous american team we are fabulous let us give a hand to america usa
POD1000000027_S0000060	and donald sterling is life was fabulous why would he think otherwise nobody ever questioned him to his face anyway he did whatever he wanted he said whatever he wanted he had relationships with whoever he wanted
POD1000000027_S0000062	i did not know vista viano back then and yes that is her real name just the letter with a period she was born maria vanessa perez
POD1000000027_S0000063	but changed her name to viviano at about the same time she would met donald at a super bowl party in 2010 before that she had been trying desperately to climb out of the poverty that she would grown up in
POD1000000027_S0000064	she had been running a food truck business and trying to work her way onto reality tv shows and cozying up to whomever was the most relevant powerful or famous then she met donald
POD1000000027_S0000066	there is an unwritten contract between young women and they are very rich but much older sugar daddies that helps each side pretend it is about love and not sex for money never talk about age pretend looks do not matter
POD1000000027_S0000067	money and erma is bags are gifts and never ever humiliate the wife but vista viano either did not know or did not care because she broke every last rule in the mistress terms and agreements
POD1000000027_S0000068	she went right at shelley
POD1000000027_S0000069	she said to the people in the office i am going to own the office one day and she said to the clipper people she says this is going to be my team one day i mean just bold really bold
POD1000000027_S0000070	and it all got back to me you know
POD1000000027_S0000071	she kept telling people she was going to be the next missus starling
POD1000000027_S0000072	catherine bowman is one of shelley is best friends and a longtime clippers fan
POD1000000027_S0000073	she would stalk shelley she would watch where shelley would go and then she would show up and i do remember one time she went into the restroom where shelley was just paraded around showed off herself then shelley walked out
POD1000000027_S0000074	at clippers game the entire extended sterling universe was usually there and usually just feet from one another sometimes shelley and donald sat in their court side seats together and sat in her seat directly across the court
POD1000000027_S0000075	other nights would sit next to donald and shelley was nowhere to be seen clipper players like ryan hollins and matt barns got used to being around you could not not notice her
POD1000000027_S0000076	she would just parade around the arena and it is like it was so awkward like we kind of know what is going on but you are doing in front of our faces as if we are silly and so was the odd odd situation
POD1000000027_S0000077	nobody liked her we knew why she was here and we all thought it was crazy to begin with but you know it was not our place to speak on it at the time
POD1000000027_S0000078	lipper is employees often got caught in the middle of this bizarre triangle shelley would call team president andy roser demanding that not be allowed in the building and then donald would call rose and ask him to leave for tickets for her
POD1000000027_S0000079	these were relationships begging to implode but none of the entangled ever tried to solve the problem donald shelley each kept pushing each other waiting for someone to break
POD1000000027_S0000080	well the breaking started on christmas day 2012 called the sterling house asking to speak to donald
POD1000000027_S0000081	we were all sitting down christmas day having dinner and she called
POD1000000027_S0000082	shelley was mortified the family was sitting at the dinner table waiting for donald as he is pacing on the tennis courts outside fighting with his mistress
POD1000000027_S0000083	i do not know they had some argument and the family heard about it you know and it just it was not a good scene
POD1000000027_S0000085	the fight with shelley started when he hung up
POD1000000027_S0000086	not that that was uncommon even without they fought often but this was escalating shelley and donald is youngest son scott had to step in before it got physical he confronted his father and demanded he stop this nonsense with
POD1000000027_S0000087	and stopped disrespecting his mother like this
POD1000000027_S0000089	it was a big moment but nothing came of it
POD1000000027_S0000091	a week later scott died
POD1000000027_S0000093	it was 1st reported to be a pulmonary embolism but later revealed to be an overdose he was 32
POD1000000027_S0000095	and i do not think people realize this but you lost a child
POD1000000027_S0000096	i know
POD1000000027_S0000097	right around then
POD1000000027_S0000098	january 1st
POD1000000027_S0000100	shelley was devastated
POD1000000027_S0000101	i was going through the motions of living
POD1000000027_S0000103	it was not just that the fight with was a last volatile moment between donald and scott
POD1000000027_S0000105	when scott died donald stayed with me instead of going home to his wife as she grieved too much she kicked down out of the house
POD1000000027_S0000107	shelley needed breathing room and i think don had pushed the envelope a little too far
POD1000000027_S0000108	i really thought that we probably were going to be getting a divorce
POD1000000027_S0000110	but shelley and donald had been together too long been through too much together had too much of their lives and their money intertwined
POD1000000027_S0000112	they did not divorce the situation simply continued to deteriorate over the next year as donald spent more and more time with
POD1000000027_S0000114	plus shelley was starting to learn about the gifts posted pictures on instagram driving the $240000 red ferrari that donald had bought her
POD1000000027_S0000115	and the range rover and the 2 bentleys shall also found out that donald had bought a $180 duplex
POD1000000027_S0000116	when i found out that he had paid for all the cars and he paid for this house i was furious
POD1000000027_S0000117	it was that anger that shelley brought to neiman marcus with the returns on the fateful day that she encountered donald and it was not the 1st time the 2 women had run into each other or argued but this time shelly decided she would had enough
POD1000000027_S0000118	and that is when i decided i was going to see her
POD1000000027_S0000119	on march 72014 shelly sterling filed a lawsuit in california superior court against siviano seeking the return of all those gifts from donald
POD1000000027_S0000121	donald and shelly sterling were worth multiple 10s of dollars and had done what the ultra rich do put all their money and property into a joint trust
POD1000000027_S0000122	every time that the stirling spent cost each of them a nickle therefore shelley argued the money that donald used to pay for the gifts was just as much hers as it was his
POD1000000027_S0000123	so she turned to the courts that sounds a little extreme well you do not know the sterlings calling a lawyer is how they get out of bed in the morning
POD1000000027_S0000124	to say they are litigious is like saying there is traffic on the 45 and besides sing to get what they want had proven incredibly effective for the sterlings over the years
POD1000000027_S0000125	most people did not have the means or the stomach to battle them in court they would settle before they starved
POD1000000027_S0000126	she kept saying to donald you better have her drop the lawsuit and he would say 0 she will not really go through with it but she is just doing it for effect and she says well she better drop the lawsuit
POD1000000027_S0000127	but here is how the lawsuit the courtroom product of a bedroom dispute really came to change everything for some time now had been recording her conversations with donald
POD1000000027_S0000128	say i am sorry
POD1000000027_S0000129	i am so sorry we made a giant mistake both of us
POD1000000027_S0000130	and according to and her lawyer donald was aware she was making the tapes
POD1000000027_S0000132	he had been forgetting things he said to her and the tapes were a way of reminding him
POD1000000027_S0000134	please leave me please please
POD1000000027_S0000135	recorded 100s of conversations over the past 2 years a lot of the recordings were mundane boring even but some of the recordings were arguments and capture decided donald that he would never want his wife or anyone else to hear
POD1000000027_S0000136	i guess you do not know that maybe you are stupid
POD1000000027_S0000137	no matter what the original intent of those tapes was they became something could use as blackmail because tavano had no intention of returning those gifts from donald
POD1000000027_S0000138	she wanted me to drop the lawsuit
POD1000000027_S0000139	says to donald i want that bitch wife of yours lawsuit dismissed
POD1000000027_S0000140	pierce 0 donnell is shelly sterling lawyer
POD1000000027_S0000141	and he tried to get shelley dismiss it and she would not do it
POD1000000027_S0000142	if donald could not or would not fix the situation decided she would take matters into her own hands it was time to use the tapes
POD1000000027_S0000143	to reveal donald sterling for who he really was

POD1000000027_S0000161	on april ninth 2014 clippers executive assistant texted on behalf of donald
POD1000000027_S0000162	the text was to make sure that i understood she was not welcome at the game against the oklahoma city thunder later that evening that her tickets her vip pass and her parking had been revoked
POD1000000027_S0000163	responded with a series of escalating texts saying she was going to the game anyway and then some veiled threats
POD1000000027_S0000164	i would hate for staple center to get involved in what is going on
POD1000000027_S0000165	3 hours later she got a response
POD1000000027_S0000166	mister sterling said you let me know if you need anything you do not want to have any issues at the game
POD1000000027_S0000167	had her opening
POD1000000027_S0000168	no you tell mister sterling that i do not need anything nor do i want anything but thanks for asking let the games begin
POD1000000027_S0000170	attached to the text was an audio file and when the clippers employee opened the file she heard this
POD1000000027_S0000171	and your grant you do not have to have yourself with walking with black people
POD1000000027_S0000172	and it bothers
POD1000000027_S0000173	it bothers me a lot that you want to broadcast that you are associating with black people have
POD1000000027_S0000174	you associate with black people
POD1000000027_S0000175	i am not you and you are not me you are supposed to be a delicate white or delicate latino girl
POD1000000027_S0000176	a mad girl
POD1000000027_S0000178	it was shocking that clippers assistant immediately emailed the file to clippers president andy roser and that is how shelly learned about the tape too
POD1000000027_S0000179	i did not even know that the tape was sent to the clippers until somebody at a game told me that they said they received a tape from her
POD1000000027_S0000180	and i said well what is the tape about so i said to andy andy roser i said and what are you doing about this and he says 0 well she will never do anything
POD1000000027_S0000181	rose had worked for donald sterling for nearly 3 decades he did what everybody learns to do after a while stay out of the really ugly stuff
POD1000000027_S0000182	donald and shelley had cleaned up their own messes for 6 decades he figured they would eventually make this one go away too but they did not shelley told her lawyers about the tapes
POD1000000027_S0000183	and they in turn went to his lawyer and demanded to hear them and that is when vitrano made her big move
POD1000000027_S0000185	i got a call by a trusted confidential source who said you have to hear this
POD1000000027_S0000186	mike walters was the news director at tmc at the time now he runs his own celebrity news site the blast
POD1000000027_S0000187	the 1st thing i did was say who is donald sterling i had heard the name i knew that donald sterling was important but i had no idea that he owned the clippers
POD1000000027_S0000188	even for someone from tmz whose job was breaking the internet with the juiciest most controversial stories this felt like something different
POD1000000027_S0000190	i received the audio and said 0 my god
POD1000000027_S0000193	it was the most repulsive disgusting
POD1000000027_S0000195	unbelievable
POD1000000027_S0000197	audio or moment that i would ever heard in my lifetime come out of somebody is mouth that then once i realized who they were how much impact that may have
POD1000000027_S0000199	but no one in the clippers world seemed to realize
POD1000000027_S0000201	fact is shelley and several people in the clippers organization heard the recording and decided not to act on it or were not appalled enough to act on it maybe they did not understand how big a splash this tape could make
POD1000000027_S0000203	i think this deals with very touchy subjects like racism sexism
POD1000000027_S0000205	things that touch everyone in this country so i knew with all of that combined with the fact that it actually was on tape
POD1000000027_S0000207	and if i could do my job properly everyone was going to hear it that this would be a gigantic thing
POD1000000027_S0000209	so mike walters called up the nba their new commissioner adam silver had barely been in office for 3 months
POD1000000027_S0000210	i actually had never heard of adam silver until that day
POD1000000027_S0000212	turns out not even tmz was going to release something like this without some due diligence
POD1000000027_S0000214	there is a balance between privacy of people and the public is interest in what is said in this audio and i think everyone will agree with me when i say this
POD1000000027_S0000215	this had to be heard period
POD1000000027_S0000217	after calling the league called the clippers to let them know they were about to publish a tape that would be very damaging to donald sterling
POD1000000027_S0000218	if you are donald sterling there is never a good time to have your girlfriend out you as a racist if you are the clippers this could not have happened at a worse moment donald sterling is clippers had been laughing stock for decades
POD1000000027_S0000220	i mean because honestly like these clippers jokes are something we they are not even jokes they are statements of fact
POD1000000027_S0000222	in the 30 some odd years he would owned the team they would only made the playoffs 6 times they would never even move past the semifinals that had all started to change in the late 2000 though the team had drafted a star blake griffin
POD1000000027_S0000223	nba rookie of the year blake griffin
POD1000000027_S0000225	and then ended up with another star chris paul
POD1000000027_S0000226	los angeles is electric with the addition of chris paul to the clippers
POD1000000027_S0000227	have you heard of the clippers before this
POD1000000027_S0000228	after a trade saga that rocked the nba and somehow ended up in favor of the perennial losers clippers over the nba is golden child the los angeles lakers
POD1000000027_S0000230	buzz in los angeles has instantly shifted to the clippers
POD1000000027_S0000231	in time for this season the clippers had also managed to get themselves one of the best coaches in the nba doc rivers
POD1000000027_S0000232	it is doc rivers to the clippers 3 years $210
POD1000000027_S0000233	there was a hope of stability balance even winning
POD1000000027_S0000235	2012 saw one playoff run 2013 saw another and 2014 was going to be the year where they might finally contend for a championship
POD1000000027_S0000236	i am excited to bring a championship here to l a and a clippers uniform
POD1000000027_S0000237	but now the cooper curse was about to rear its head again
POD1000000027_S0000238	the one thing i can always rely on is that the clippers screw things up
POD1000000027_S0000240	once the clippers staff found out tmz was going to publish the tape andy roser went to coach doc rivers he needed him to talk to the team before the story broke
POD1000000027_S0000241	and i remember coming into my office one day said hey there is a tape that has that is going to come out it is not that flattering but it is not a big deal honestly i thought it was a sex tape because of donald sterling i really did
POD1000000027_S0000242	so dack did as he was told and gathered the players and warned them that something was coming superstar clippers forward blake griffin and senator ryan hollands were in that room
POD1000000027_S0000243	doc gathered us
POD1000000027_S0000244	said hey guys we need to meet and talk
POD1000000027_S0000245	this is about to come
POD1000000027_S0000246	we do not know what the heck this is going to turn into
POD1000000027_S0000247	people are going to run with this none of us realize the extent because we did not hear the recording or whatever it was
POD1000000027_S0000248	he tells us to kind of prepare yourself because we are playing golden state and the focus ahead is win the game
POD1000000027_S0000249	i think we were all kind of like all right well this is another thing we will get ready for this game
POD1000000027_S0000251	welcome back to sportscenter where we have some breaking news a disturbing story including the owner of one of the nba is playoff teams
POD1000000027_S0000252	dropped this story at 10 pm pacific time on a friday night april 25th 2014
POD1000000027_S0000253	an audio recording purportedly of los angeles clippers owner donald sterling making racist remarks to his girlfriend is being investigated by the national basketball association
POD1000000027_S0000254	why should you be walking publicly with black people
POD1000000027_S0000255	does it matter if they are white or blue or yellow
POD1000000027_S0000256	i guess you do not know that maybe you are stupid
POD1000000027_S0000258	i was covering the nba playoffs for espn when this scandal broke like literally i was shortsighted at a game in portland and i get this frantic phone call from our news
POD1000000027_S0000259	telling me i had to listen to this tape
POD1000000027_S0000261	people call you and tell you that i have black people on instagram and it bothers you
POD1000000027_S0000262	yeah it bothers me a lot that you want to broadcast that you are associating with black people have
POD1000000027_S0000264	suddenly the playoff game between the trailblazers and the houston rockets taking place in front of me seemed completely insignificant
POD1000000027_S0000266	filed my game story and tried to start wrapping my head around this one
POD1000000027_S0000268	like tms mike walters soon as i heard that tape i knew this was going to be huge
POD1000000027_S0000269	the disgraced clippers owner in the spotlight
POD1000000027_S0000270	only has a long history of questionable behavior
POD1000000027_S0000272	it is obviously appalling it is very disturbing but to be quite honest with you i was not too surprised
POD1000000027_S0000273	within hours the audio of donald sterling making racist remarks to vista viano had gone viral
POD1000000027_S0000275	tim is cameramen and reporters swarmed the lobby of the clippers team hotel they had booked several rooms at the 4 seasons in advance so they could legally be inside the private property
POD1000000027_S0000276	outside the hotel was even more chaotic the whole world wanted a reaction clippers team security advised players and staffers to stay inside their hotel rooms as much as possible they were on lockdown
POD1000000027_S0000277	when it came out i remember just being chaos just from then on it was just that is all anybody was talking about
POD1000000027_S0000278	by morning lebron james the biggest star in the league was saying there is no room for a person like donald sterling in the nba
POD1000000027_S0000280	and across the country adam silver was facing his 1st real crisis
POD1000000027_S0000281	nba commissioner adam silver sitting down in memphis addressing the comments made by donald sterling
POD1000000027_S0000282	the audio recording posted by tmz is truly offensive and disturbing and we intend to get to the bottom of it as quickly as possible
POD1000000027_S0000283	silver launched an investigation within hours
POD1000000027_S0000284	i am not yet prepared to discuss any potential sanctions against donald sterling we will however move extraordinarily quickly in our investigation
POD1000000027_S0000286	if it was sterling on those tapes if they had not been doctored or altered silver knew he wanted to punish him severely the league was outraged
POD1000000027_S0000287	because on top of donald sterling saying all those unforgivably racist things sterling was also taking shots at one of the most beloved figures in all of basketball magic johnson
POD1000000027_S0000289	it was as shocking and as bizarre as anything on the tape that a picture of siviano and magic johnson had set him off to hear donald sterling talk that way about magic
POD1000000027_S0000290	the guy who turned the lakers into a dynasty who fought off hiv that is the guy donald sterling told his mistress was not welcome at his games
POD1000000027_S0000291	plain and simple when you heard those comments magic what was your reaction
POD1000000027_S0000292	was really upset you know you can not understand how hurt i was he should not own a team anymore especially when you have african americans renting his apartments coming to the games
POD1000000027_S0000293	and playing for him and coaching for him this is this is bad for everybody it is bad for america and so i am really upset about it
POD1000000027_S0000294	even the famously apolitical michael jordan voiced his outrage
POD1000000027_S0000295	michael jordan weighed in there is no room in the nba or anywhere else for the kind of racism and hatred that mister sterling allegedly expressed we cannot tolerate must not tolerate discrimination at any level
POD1000000027_S0000296	but the story was bigger than the nba it revealed something raw and ugly it triggered 10s of people
POD1000000027_S0000298	it is like what one of the paparazzi who was trailing donald and shelley told me it had all the elements sex money sports politics greed racism
POD1000000027_S0000299	it had everything it even had the visor you remember the visor that daft punk welding mask meets florida grandma visor that viviana wore any time she stepped outside of her house
POD1000000027_S0000300	but still say nothing is vivian not late this afternoon when she arrived home or when she left tonight wearing different clothes but color coordinated face shields
POD1000000027_S0000301	the woman who set this whole thing off was out the roller blading for the paparazzi
POD1000000027_S0000302	have you talked to mister sterling can you explain the mask
POD1000000027_S0000303	this was a full on media circus
POD1000000027_S0000304	why are you wearing the shield why are you holding a microphone
POD1000000027_S0000305	i do not know it is my job well then it is my job
POD1000000027_S0000306	by the end of the weekend the 1st black president of the united states was answering questions about sterling
POD1000000027_S0000308	i suspect that he is going to be deeply concerned in in resolving this you know we the united states continues to wrestle with the legacy of of race
POD1000000027_S0000309	the tapes dominated the news cycle not just because they were juicy but because donald sterling was articulating something deeper more shameful
POD1000000027_S0000311	a plantation mentality that is at the heart of a lot of this country is history
POD1000000027_S0000313	that is an nba owner a man worth 10s of dollars going on for more than 9 minutes spewing the most vile of racist thoughts a white owner whose twentyman roster was stacked with a majority of african american players
POD1000000027_S0000314	including ryan holland
POD1000000027_S0000315	those words hurt when you hear i do not want people like that well the people like that play for you the people like that buy your tickets the people like that bleed just like you bro
POD1000000027_S0000317	earthquakes both real and metaphorical happen suddenly but they are anything but sudden the tremor is a product of tensions that build up for years until the fault lines simply break
POD1000000027_S0000318	los angeles sits on 2 fault lines san andreas and race all of us know it we live with it donald sterling was another
POD1000000027_S0000319	anyone who played for him or worked for him or covered him in the press or lived in one of his 100s of apartments on the one hand knew that it was all a matter of time until he blew up the underlying issues with stirling were well known and well documented
POD1000000027_S0000320	but like most insanely wealthy white men in america donald had managed to wiggle bully and fight his way out of all of them he knew how to play his leverage and power outlast his adversaries and win you can call it that
POD1000000027_S0000321	this time felt different
POD1000000027_S0000323	i remember i had said this is really bad really bad and i knew something was going to happen i did not know what it was like shock
POD1000000027_S0000325	that is what we all were shocked but we should not have been surprised
POD1000000029_S0000001	facebook is had 15 months of quote fresh hell but 210 still use it or instagram or whatsapp or messenger every day
POD1000000029_S0000002	from american public media this is marketplace tech demystifying the digital economy i am jack stuart in for molly wood
POD1000000029_S0000004	despite the privacy scandals the federal investigations and the accusations of destroying democracy this week facebook reported its advertising revenue and global users are growing
POD1000000029_S0000005	in this week is quality assurance we take a deep dive into why in its early years facebook prioritized growth over everything else
POD1000000029_S0000006	nearly every crisis facebook now faces stems from that nicholas thompson editor in chief of wired says that is left management to navigate a metaphorical minefield
POD1000000029_S0000007	there was a lot of unexploded ordinance that they were inevitably going to step on at some point
POD1000000029_S0000008	he is an author on the magazine is latest cover story which goes behind the scenes at the troubled company he says facebook is business is actually solid for a couple of reasons
POD1000000029_S0000009	number one the advertising business model they came up with is one of the greatest ever and it does not require lots of changes they just built an amazing business model and the marginal cost of bringing in new advertisers are very low
POD1000000029_S0000010	secondly one of the smartest business decisions that mark zuckerberg ever made was to buy instagram and people do not really understand that instagram is owned by facebook or if they distrust facebook they do not distrust instagram so instagram continues to grow
POD1000000029_S0000011	so they make lots of money off of core facebook they have lots of user growth on instagram and whatsapp and the business is doing great
POD1000000029_S0000012	you would think at some point that maybe advertisers would start to push back i mean if facebook is reputation has really taken this really huge dent that it appears it has why do people still want to advertise with it
POD1000000029_S0000013	well because the advertising continues to work if at some point people have an icky feeling when they use facebook and therefore the ads are less effective then advertisers will leave
POD1000000029_S0000014	but at this moment facebook allows you to very specifically target specific users in ways that you cannot on other platforms and for lots of advertisers that is just a deal that is too good to pass up
POD1000000029_S0000015	now facebook is anticipating what it says up to a $50 fine from the federal trade commission we heard that from it this week about how it is handled some of these privacy issues
POD1000000029_S0000016	will they even feel that is the question they have so much cash on hand is it a big deal
POD1000000029_S0000017	no so facebook put out in their earnings call they said that they anticipate a 3 to $50 fine i do not know whether that is because those are the numbers the fcc has been talking about with them or if facebook is just trying to set expectations as a negotiating tactics
POD1000000029_S0000018	i would not rule out the possibility that facebook is hit with a $10 fine or a $20 fine regardless to your question even if it is at the higher end whether it is 5 or 10 or 20 it is tiny
POD1000000029_S0000019	the market cap is up i believe $40 as we talked this morning so it is not a huge hit to them obviously they would rather have $50 than not have $50 but they will be fine regardless of what this number comes out at
POD1000000029_S0000020	the thing they really worry about is antitrust if there is anti trust regulation and it comes down hard on them that is a serious problem and that would make the market drop dramatically
POD1000000029_S0000021	what are the stakes for facebook is leadership around all of these scandals the the fake news the offensive content the privacy you know you detail that they have got something like 30000 moderators now does that men they actually taking this seriously as a business risk
POD1000000029_S0000022	yes absolutely facebook is taking it very seriously as a business risk so there are 2 really interesting questions in there so number one is do they take this seriously as a business risk absolutely are they committed to trying to counter fake news and all of the manipulation on the platform
POD1000000029_S0000023	absolutely what are the stakes to their business they are very high scandal continues to multiply there could be real consequences down the road what are the stakes specifically to top management meaning mark zuckerberg and sheryl sandberg the 2 people who we most associate with the company
POD1000000029_S0000024	for zuckerberg he is going to run the company as long as he wants to he has voting control of the shares he is appointed his friends as board members he is in a good position
POD1000000029_S0000025	whenever he wants to go and run the chan zuckerberg initiative or just go be an intellectual thought leader or do bill gates type things he will go choose to do that for sandberg it is tougher
POD1000000029_S0000026	and there were moments in the last year where it seemed like she might be sacrificed or where she might be in big trouble zuckerberg has expressed his loyalty to her
POD1000000029_S0000027	but as the scandals multiplied and as they started to touch her in a way they never had before it seemed as though her position was at risk and it is also certainly the case that the public reputation of both of them has dropped
POD1000000029_S0000028	a year ago we were talking about each of them as potential presidential candidates now there is not a chance
POD1000000029_S0000029	what about the morale in the wider company in the wake of all of this do you get the feeling from the people you have been talking to in your reporting that employees fairly satisfied there i am laughing even as i say that or is there a whole lot of internal chaos at this company
POD1000000029_S0000030	there is a lot more employee dissatisfaction than there was 2 years
POD1000000029_S0000031	there are lots of employees who i talked to there who say 0 this place is great it is cool you know the media hates us but that is not my problem i am happy and he bunch of other people who say you know we deserve a lot of the hatred we made a lot of mistakes
POD1000000029_S0000032	we trampled on people is privacies and you know i regret all that we have done i talked to a lot of people who are thinking about going to work there and it does not have the halo that it did 2 years ago
POD1000000029_S0000033	they still pay you well the fact that the stock continues to go up is great particularly for people who have options
POD1000000029_S0000034	but it is a less exciting place to work and that is one of the true risks for the company and one of the most adverse effects of the last 2 years for facebook
POD1000000029_S0000035	did any part in this reporting particularly you know given how much time you have spent on facebook directly now did anything really surprise you
POD1000000029_S0000036	there was one specific story that stunned me and that was the circumstances that led to the departure of the 2 founders of instagram kevin systrom and mike reger
POD1000000029_S0000037	and when fred vogelstein and i started reporting the story we made a list of the mysteries we wanted to solve and that was at the very top why had they left it seemed strange they had left all of a sudden in september
POD1000000029_S0000038	no one knew why and later in the reporting you know months into reporting the story we finally learned the full story and that is that according to people close to them they had grown frustrated with zuckerberg is increased mealing
POD1000000029_S0000039	they did not like the idea that instagram was going to be further merged with whatsapp and with facebook and there was real tension over instagram is growth
POD1000000029_S0000040	and there was a sense among some people at facebook that instagram is growth was coming at the expense of core facebook and that led to all kinds of tensions and then a big fight at the end of july and a moment where mark zuckerberg
POD1000000029_S0000041	according to people observing all of this mark zuckerberg asked one of his deputies to draw up a list of all the ways that facebook supported instagram the way it drove users towards instagram
POD1000000029_S0000042	and then he gave the list to kevin systrom and said we are getting rid of all of these and according to people familiar with the story systrom reacted quite badly to that and then went on paternity leave came back and said i am done here
POD1000000029_S0000043	and so the biggest surprise to us was that the departure of systran criger which had not come out before was much denser much denser than i had believed when i began reporting this story
POD1000000029_S0000044	nick thompson editor in chief of wired for context a $50 fine would be a record tech penalty in the u s beating the 220 that google had to pay in 2012
POD1000000029_S0000046	and now for some related links the new york times has a good explainer on why both facebook and the ftc would be happy with a chunky fine one ends up looking strong the other looks accountable but really nothing much changes
POD1000000029_S0000047	european regulators have been tougher on tech companies google facebook and twitter all have to do more to tackle fake news to satisfy them and they want to see progress ahead of eu elections next month that is according to reuters
POD1000000029_S0000048	and even canada is getting in on the action according to the cbc this week privacy regulators there say facebook broke several laws over unauthorized data access they plan to take the company to court
POD1000000029_S0000049	if you enjoyed mark zuckerberg is testimony in front of congress here in the us with his singing comebacks like senator we run ads then maybe you will enjoy hearing more directly from mister zuckerberg himself
POD1000000029_S0000050	i mean facebook was accused of not being open enough i am not really sure how deep into the heads of tech entrepreneurs you really want to get but zach does have a podcast now i am not suggesting you listen i am just giving you this information
POD1000000029_S0000051	it is called tech and society with mark zuckerberg just yeah do not at me matt purdy produced this week is marketplace tech along with stephanie hughes and eve trow is our senior producer

POD1000000033_S0000004	over 30% of americans do not have access to broadband internet which is defined as 25 megabits per 2nd or higher that is according to research released tuesday by the npd group
POD1000000033_S0000005	the pew charitable trusts has an initiative dedicated to figuring out why this is the case today the organization is broadband research initiative is launching a new tool that lets anyone browse through broadband policies and funding in any state in the u s
POD1000000033_S0000006	it sorts the information in categories like funding competition and regulation infrastructure access and broadband definitions
POD1000000033_S0000007	like in alabama for example broadband speed is defined as only 10 megabits per 2nd if your network is busy that is barely fast enough to stream netflix and hide
POD1000000033_S0000008	katherine dewitt manages the broadband research initiative for pew charitable trusts she told me state policy is a huge deal when it comes to expanding broadband access
POD1000000033_S0000009	state policy matters because lack of access to broadband is a national issue but it is felt at the local level and states have taken a pretty aggressive approach to closing gaps in access particularly over the last 5 years
POD1000000033_S0000010	we have seen a significant uptick in legislation since 2015 and what we can take away from this is not only do state policymakers see and feel that immediate urgency of lack of broadband
POD1000000033_S0000011	they are saying it is important to things like education health care and economic development but they are also saying this is what we want our state to look like they are setting goals and then they are laying out a path and a framework for how to achieve those goals
POD1000000033_S0000012	let us just dive into some of what is in the tool some of the different approaches that states are taking like could you give me an example of 2 totally different approaches that states might have taken
POD1000000033_S0000013	so going into this research we knew that states faced similar challenges and increasing access to broadband but we learned that they are also taking similar approaches but adapting them to their needs that is really where those categories came from those groupings
POD1000000033_S0000014	if you look at goals for example you have states like minnesota and west virginia where their statewide broadband goals are focused on border to border universal coverage
POD1000000033_S0000015	then you look at a state like california that has a goal to connect 98% of the population in each one of its roughly 20 regions
POD1000000033_S0000016	how do you hope that a tool like this can help close the digital divide in terms of broadband access
POD1000000033_S0000017	well this tool is actually the 1st step in our ongoing research on how states are addressing gaps in broadband access so for us this was about understanding that 50 state landscape of broadband deployment laws
POD1000000033_S0000018	and it provides the basis for our next level of research which is a deeper examination of how states are addressing those gaps in access
POD1000000033_S0000019	what we hope though is that users will be able to use this tool to learn what other states are doing and how they are actually doing it
POD1000000033_S0000020	katherine dewitt manages the broadband research initiative for the pew charitable trusts we have got a link to that new tool and some analysis about spending per state at our website marketplace tech dot org
POD1000000033_S0000022	and now for some related links so this tool is super new obviously and hopes that policymakers and local governments will jump in and start creating some more analysis and comparison and of course they will be publishing their own pieces
POD1000000033_S0000023	the 1st one that i mentioned there is about how states fund their broadband projects whether it is grants or loans or general fund kind of things or some creative funding
POD1000000033_S0000024	apparently illinois makes internet service providers pay into a special coffer called the digital divide elimination fund and it uses that to pay for broadband build outs
POD1000000033_S0000025	and in virginia a legal settlement with tobacco producers is paying to build more internet
POD1000000033_S0000026	i am not saying this is not a little wonky over here but it is interesting also i got to be honest i am still hung up on that 10 megabits per 2nd in alabama and probably some other states too i have not made it through the entire tool yet
POD1000000033_S0000027	but alabama is regulation also says isps can call their upload speeds broadband at one megabyte per 2nd so basically if you are at home trying to upload some photos to facebook or anything to the cloud ever
POD1000000033_S0000028	you would be doing that at speeds 10 times slower than the slowest 4 cell phone connection set it and forget it because it is going to take all night
POD1000000033_S0000029	now this speed question is so controversial that even though is using the 25 megabit per 2nd speed guideline which is set by the federal communications commission network congestion usually means actual speeds are nowhere near that fast
POD1000000033_S0000030	and again a 4 g phone connection is faster than that on the best providers
POD1000000033_S0000031	it is such a big discrepancy that while he says 210 americans do not have broadband microsoft put out its own map of high speed internet access back in april
POD1000000033_S0000032	it said the real number of people without appropriately fast internet access for today is economy is more like a 1630 in the united states alone
POD1000000033_S0000034	i am molly wood and that is marketplace tech
POD1000000033_S0000036	this is apm
POD1000000038_S0000001	let us take a break from real life for a moment to visit the somewhat near future on tv
POD1000000038_S0000002	although i have to warn you that is kind of dark too
POD1000000038_S0000003	from american public media this is marketplace tech demystifying the digital economy i am molly wood
POD1000000038_S0000005	the bbc hbo show years and years combines the politics economy and tech of 2019 and imagines how it all might evolve over the next 15 years
POD1000000038_S0000006	emma thompson is in it as a celebrity british politician with autocratic leanings but mainly the show follows a family as they deal with the world changing around them
POD1000000038_S0000007	russell davis created and wrote years and years he is also worked on the show is doctor torchwood and created queer folk
POD1000000038_S0000008	he said the tech in years and years is like life it is complicated
POD1000000038_S0000010	how good and bad i think some of the saddest moments it is it is you have a world war being announced on television and the little 56 year old kids just sit staring into their phones playing their games
POD1000000038_S0000011	so yes there is bad stuff but that is very easy to talk about and yet there is very very good stuff i tell you actually when i made the choice to center this around a family
POD1000000038_S0000012	that came from one of the good sides of current tech which is very simply the whatsapp group i am one of 3 kids there is 2 sisters they have got 2 kids each we are a nice family we all like each other we get on
POD1000000038_S0000013	but up until a couple of years ago my nieces grown up 23 years ago i would have texted them twice a year happy birthday and merry christmas now 0 my god i went out the other night and i came back to the whatsapp group of 53 messages
POD1000000038_S0000015	because someone had cooked a lacana with butternut squash so yes there is good stuff if you choose either good or either bad you are not very good writer you have got to get both in there because in the end it is not the technology it is it is the people
POD1000000038_S0000016	well it is great because some of the tech feels really immediate like a headband that projects a holographic sort of snapchat filter for your face that everyone can see in the physical world it is futuristic but it is also completely realistic
POD1000000038_S0000017	yes yes i think if that was invented tomorrow we would all go and buy one i mean i find those filters fascinating
POD1000000038_S0000019	send each other is photos of themselves looking like a dog
POD1000000038_S0000021	rash of instagram filters like what dog are you or what cake are you i am certainly a battenberg i love those filters and i am fascinated by the way we love those filters
POD1000000038_S0000022	and so the moment someone invents a filter you can see in the real world not just on your phone 0 my god i would be phoning you from my palace on the moon
POD1000000038_S0000023	do you have conflicting you know feelings about tech or is it like so many things where it just reflects the real world
POD1000000038_S0000024	yeah it is interesting i think it is both i think i think you have to be entertaining but entertaining does not mean being glib or da i think i am getting older i think my stuff is full of warnings now to be honest it is funny i am now in the middle of an edit of my next drama
POD1000000038_S0000026	hbo max over there which is about the aids crisis of the 1980 s
POD1000000038_S0000028	just watched an edit of an episode warning about viruses and we step out of our front doors and there is a virus on the loose it is you can not learn those lessons from history enough it is strange is not it what a world
POD1000000038_S0000029	i was telling people that i am taking a little bit of comfort in a darker timeline but there is something comforting about the passage of time right like you fast forward in these episodes and increasingly terrible things happen but also
POD1000000038_S0000030	people are still living their normal lives talk to me about that sense of perspective
POD1000000038_S0000031	yes that is right i mean it is it was quite hard show to sell initially with its concept of moving forward in time and every episode moves forward a year but actually i sat there saying
POD1000000038_S0000033	be questioned about it 57 times
POD1000000038_S0000035	you know what else moves forward a year in every episode downton abbey
POD1000000038_S0000036	and so did upstairs downstairs many years ago it is it is actually not a format of drama i have invented it is simply the fact that this drama is going into the future by a year every episode that had people scared but in terms of drama terms of how the characters are getting on who loves who
POD1000000038_S0000037	who is going out with who who is cross with who who loves who to take yearly jumps in there is a very simple dramatic device so
POD1000000038_S0000038	i knew that would work i had the confidence of those those forebears to say this will work and
POD1000000038_S0000039	and it was to get that sort of creep into the story which which
POD1000000038_S0000041	in in societies when dictators arise or where huge changes are made and and where society might swing from left to right or right to left it does not happen overnight that is why i wanted
POD1000000038_S0000042	what ends up as like a 15 year span on the show is is to so show these things slowly creeping up on you and actually you are more concerned with having your tea or falling in love
POD1000000038_S0000043	or having a divorce that is actually the stuff the meat and drink of your life while the bigger shadows are falling on you unseen so i needed that stretch to show the small picture of people living within a bigger picture
POD1000000038_S0000044	so episode 6 introduces a virus and with the coronavirus happening right now i wonder is that something you would have done differently
POD1000000038_S0000045	in the show or is that just one of the many sort of things going on in the future
POD1000000038_S0000046	it is interesting because because actually it comes up in episode 6 as it is a means of isolating people within the story to be honest now i am seeing a virus like this in action
POD1000000038_S0000047	it would have dominated episode 6 too much actually it is amazing how it dominates our every conversation now and episode 6 as a drama not not as a document of the real world but as a drama has stories to wrap up
POD1000000038_S0000049	we need to know
POD1000000038_S0000050	whether lovers will be reunited whether marriages will stay together so it is very interesting now that i sort of think that i mean i had done a lot of research into viruses and what would happen so i kind of you know i knew i knew the difference is between endemics and pandemics
POD1000000038_S0000051	but i chose to background it and this is a separate drama itself really my goodness this is strange days again just keep getting madder what did we used to talk about 2006 what what did we talk about can you remember interest rates
POD1000000038_S0000052	cows and cattle what did we talk about guinea pigs i do not know
POD1000000038_S0000053	i can not remember what we talked about 2 weeks ago even i mean do you feel anxious like when you reach inside creatively and and pull out
POD1000000038_S0000054	what in some ways is like the worst case scenario that we are imagining in our brains and put them on screen does that make you anxious
POD1000000038_S0000056	i talked about my family that lovely family i was just describing one of my nieces just had twins one year ago they had lovely lovely baby twins and and that makes me anxious i kind of look at them thinking
POD1000000038_S0000057	you know i do believe in global warming i do believe we are in trouble i do believe that as a result the political situation i think the heating up of our political situation is tied into global warming
POD1000000038_S0000058	on a vast scale it is very and for the 1st time in my life we look at little kids thinking i am not sure you will have a better world i am not sure at all you will so i have got anxiety and and as a writer that is bound to come out in my work
POD1000000038_S0000059	i do have to say years and years does have a happy ending happy is ending sort of bitter sweet but is a happy ending because i also believe in that i think i think real life could be disastrous enough and i think we you are writing fiction you should reach a happy end
POD1000000038_S0000060	because it is hard work hard happy endings are tough to find and and miserable endings are easy so i try to look for hope in it and i do have hope in people actually that
POD1000000038_S0000061	we are great survivors and great thinkers and actually i think most people are nice i think people are fundamentally nice that word we are not allowed to use nice because it seems like a bland word but i think it is a beautiful word people are nice
POD1000000038_S0000062	and i have to hope that our niceness prevails
POD1000000038_S0000063	russell davis created and wrote years and years
POD1000000038_S0000065	some related links if you had not heard of years and years like me you are really not alone it did show up on a bunch of end of 2019 lists as some of the year is best tv

POD1000000047_S0000000	welcome to the 80000 hours podcast this interview with david spiegelhalter is a bit unusual in that it was actually recorded 2 years ago
POD1000000047_S0000002	were considering starting a podcast back then and i recorded this trial episode with my colleague jess whitestone but ultimately we did not have the time to go ahead with the project but i thought why not dig it up and release it now
POD1000000047_S0000004	david spiegelhalter is a statistician at the university of cambridge and something of an academic celebrity in the u k
POD1000000047_S0000006	part of his role is to improve the public understanding of risk especially everyday risks we face like getting cancer or dying in a car crash as a result he is regularly in the media explaining the numbers in the news
POD1000000047_S0000007	trying to assist both ordinary people and politicians to focus on the most important risks that confront us and avoid being distracted by flashy risks that perhaps do not actually have that much impact
POD1000000047_S0000009	to help make sense of the uncertainties we face in life he is had to invent concepts like the microlife or a 30 minute change in life expectancy
POD1000000047_S0000011	we gave him a cool because we wanted to learn whether he thought a lifetime of work had actually made that much difference to the world enjoy
POD1000000047_S0000013	here at the center for effective altruism we are interested in finding ways to compare what it means to do good and to figure out which ways of doing good do the most good so we ask questions like which charities should you donate to if you want to help as many people as possible
POD1000000047_S0000014	what careers should you follow if you want to improve the world and which cause areas have the largest impact these are the sorts of questions that we think it is really important to get clear so you know how you can make a real difference
POD1000000047_S0000016	help us answer some of these questions we are joined by professor david spiegelhalter the winton professor for the public understanding of risk at cambridge university professor spiegelhalter spent much of his life trying to improve public understanding of statistics science and risk in ordinary life
POD1000000047_S0000018	regularly appears in the uk media and writes on his blog understanding uncertainty it is great to have you with us today david
POD1000000047_S0000019	
POD1000000047_S0000021	so we have got so many things we would like to talk about we will see how far we get but 1st tell us a bit about your who you are and your position
POD1000000047_S0000022	yeah yeah i have got a strange job really i am in the math department at cambridge and i teach statistics to the undergraduates but i am actually funded by a hedge fund winton capital management have endowed my chair in order to improve
POD1000000047_S0000023	the public understanding of statistics and risk and so what i have done since i have had that job for the last 8 years is i suppose to try to join the general community of people who are
POD1000000047_S0000024	trying to improve the way numbers in particular are discussed in society
POD1000000047_S0000026	what kinds of questions do you research and what outreach do you do to help the public understand numbers and uncertainty better
POD1000000047_S0000027	well i get asked to do a huge amount of stuff i suppose helping in various agencies communicating risk about cancer risk about the risk of screening for example risks and benefits of screening my background is in medical statistics
POD1000000047_S0000028	so that is what i get to do quite a lot but i have done tv programs about climate change i have done radio stuff about you know all sorts of threats to society from fukushima and so on
POD1000000047_S0000029	everything to do with trying to get a handle on you know what are the important threats to us individually and and what we how we might be able to make comparisons between those so
POD1000000047_S0000030	i am very interested in rather than sort of the great global existential risk i am more interested in the things that affect us all individually about how we eat our exercise transport and so
POD1000000047_S0000032	so yeah one of the things that i find really interesting in this area is that there is a lot of evidence that people tend to be very poor at estimating lots of different probabilities and so end up
POD1000000047_S0000033	overestimating the scale of some problems or risks that they face and underestimating others from your experience what kinds of problems do you think that people tend to be most prone to overestimate or underestimate and get wrong in very harmful ways
POD1000000047_S0000034	well there has been a lot of research on this by psychologists as you know and and of course when we talk about people i always include myself in this
POD1000000047_S0000035	i am as subject to the whims of my emotional gut reactions as much as anybody else i am not making any claim about some superior knowledge and rationality compared with everybody else because
POD1000000047_S0000036	we just know that the way we respond to things you know to simplify a lot you know we can think in 2 different ways we can respond with our guts or we can try to engage our brain and think slowly about
POD1000000047_S0000037	and and this is so relevant when it comes to risk and particularly this idea that what is available to us is availability critic is very strong
POD1000000047_S0000038	what we hear in the news you know we hear about ebola we hear about terrorism we hear about you know the latest threat that might that might be in what we eat and way we travel and we get very concerned about this whether it is a plane crash or whatever
POD1000000047_S0000039	and because that is what is in the news that is what is available to us that is what is what is so prominent but of course so many of these risks are actually very small indeed this is not a threat to us particularly at all
POD1000000047_S0000040	and the things that are much more familiar that we do not hear much of you know for example heart disease cancer all those sort of stuff that we get a large amount of that is because of the way we live our lack of exercise our crummy diet
POD1000000047_S0000041	and so on the course is people get a bit bored with that because and and do not get so concerned about it
POD1000000047_S0000042	do you feel you have had any success improving public understanding of risk and getting people to focus on the stuff that really matters
POD1000000047_S0000043	0 i do not know it is very difficult to measure i mean it would be great to think so and i have been involved in some good projects that i am very proud of for example the redesign of the cancer screening leaflets in the uk which present the benefits and risks
POD1000000047_S0000044	cancer screening in in a very balanced way they are hugely innovative innovative is in that they do not actually recommend people go for screening they just say well these are the possible benefits
POD1000000047_S0000045	these are the possible harms make up your own mind and i believe that is the right way to go about communicating risk is not to say you got to watch out you got to watch out this is terrible say well if you do this this might happen or it might not happen
POD1000000047_S0000046	and weigh it up and actually you know give people credit for some intelligence which i think people basically are do not think people are so stupid and what i am proud of is being part of a general community that is very strong in britain to do with public engagement in science
POD1000000047_S0000047	
POD1000000047_S0000049	which is i am just a small part of that because it is covers material on the radio stuff on television stuff in in some newspapers and in various agencies for example the statistics author
POD1000000047_S0000050	which is just trying to take a much more critical attitude to the way that numbers and evidence are used in society and i think it it works in britain were rather good compared with most people about
POD1000000047_S0000052	we do not have these massive fears of vaccinations of nuclear power of even gmos and so i think this is a sign that we in this country have developed quite a good public engagement with science community
POD1000000047_S0000054	i was actually going to ask you about what potential you think there is for young people who want to have an impact with their career going into a career path similar to your own and trying to get into public outreach and engagement to
POD1000000047_S0000055	to have a broader impact rather than necessarily just doing research in academia so how hard you think it is to do this kind of thing and is it sounds like this is definitely something you wish more academics did work on
POD1000000047_S0000056	absolutely i mean i have really come to it quite late as as a real part of my career i said again because a philanthropist in a hedge fund you know provided the funding for me to be able to do this full time
POD1000000047_S0000057	but i was doing some before as part of my job and increasingly feel that it is actually a duty of academics who after all are publicly funded for a certain proportion of them to really spend some time on public engagement it does not suit everybody
POD1000000047_S0000058	not everybody all though i think everybody should have a website explaining what they do and and that this should be also supported and there should be incentives within the career structure for academics to do
POD1000000047_S0000059	i am quite pleased that in cambridge for example when we are looking at promotion of people their public engagement is taken very seriously indeed something i strongly support so it is not for everybody but i think it is a very important thing for academics to do
POD1000000047_S0000060	as they are doing their work almost in whatever area it has relevance to society and it can potentially
POD1000000047_S0000062	improve society and they should be working on
POD1000000047_S0000063	i personally think that statistics is a particularly important area for improvement of society i feel this very strongly and many statisticians do in terms of public engagement
POD1000000047_S0000064	the real statistical society has now got an initiative of we are training up statistics ambassadors young statisticians who who want to do this who really want to get out there and communicate the importance of their work and try to improve the way things are done with with numbers and evidence
POD1000000047_S0000065	i think this is so exciting such
POD1000000047_S0000067	so a lot of young people we meet are thinking of going into academia do you feel like that is a good place to be to have a big impact in the world of course there are also some drawbacks that you might be aware of from your experience of being in academia
POD1000000047_S0000068	yes yeah i am not i would not necessarily say you know to recommend yes you really should go into academia you know it does not suit everybody and and frankly compared with when i started it is quite seems very tough
POD1000000047_S0000069	most careers there seems to be a lot more pressure on than there used to be so it is it can be quite a tough call i think but there is potential to do a lot of good stuff and you know people work the people i work with and know in other areas whether they are working in
POD1000000047_S0000070	natural natural you know natural threats natural disasters whether they are working in botany whether they work in any area plant sciences whatever are really dedicated to trying to improve
POD1000000047_S0000071	the lot of the world and i am so impressed by their dedication but it is a tough job and you do not necessarily see in this sort of push to you have got to publish the work you have got to do all this you got to go through all this
POD1000000047_S0000073	all this business in order to build one is career it does not necessarily appear at 1st that you are actually doing great good in what you do very little of it you can see a direct impact however as i know that what is very good about it is that
POD1000000047_S0000074	it is it is building a lot of transferrable skills that you can use and i find that in my statistical skills for example are in massive demand by all sorts of agencies i could point in particular to the
POD1000000047_S0000075	importance of the millennium development goals and and the sustainable development goals which are which are
POD1000000047_S0000076	which are replacing them in which the sort of monitoring of the state of welfare in different countries around the world has become absolutely vital and just being able to measure things and know what is going on and
POD1000000047_S0000077	to develop good ways to do surveys to actually look at what works and how you can improve these measures is has become enormously vital enormously important so i think well again i am coming back to the fact that i think statistics is
POD1000000047_S0000078	particularly valuable area to go into
POD1000000047_S0000080	yeah absolutely and just a little bit more broadly you know the key idea behind effective altruism is that we want to try and figure out which altruistic activities which charities which career paths which causes do the most good and we think that being able to
POD1000000047_S0000081	measure things or at least trying to measure things is incredibly valuable in making progress on those questions but obviously these are many of these questions are incredibly difficult to answer so a common criticism that we often get is people saying something like
POD1000000047_S0000082	0 it is impossible to figure out which charities or careers do the most good so you are wasting yourself trying and you should just go with your gut or you know help personal causes what do you think of this kind of objection and do you think that there is anything to it
POD1000000047_S0000083	you know concern about there being too much uncertainty and you know we often respond by saying that you know it does not mean that we should not try and estimation is clearly the best we have but yeah what are your thoughts on this challenge and
POD1000000047_S0000085	i mean this is not a comment that is just restricted to what the area that you are talking about it happens all the time it used to happen in healthcare people say 0 you can not put a value on human life
POD1000000047_S0000086	we have just got to do all we can to do good and we have to just go with our guts essentially this that view now certainly in the uk it has been completely discredited you can put our valley on a human we do all the time
POD1000000047_S0000087	not sure everyone would agree but
POD1000000047_S0000088	not everyone can agree and of course
POD1000000047_S0000089	you have to
POD1000000047_S0000090	but if for example has been doing this for over a decade
POD1000000047_S0000092	putting a value on the marginal benefit of a particular health care intervention and assessing what should be supported under the national health service according to these formal criteria now we know this is not perfect we know this does not measure everything
POD1000000047_S0000093	but it is explicit it is transparent and they have done their best and i think it has been a massive success and a huge example to other countries is how you can go about it now we know it is it is never perfect it is never perfect
POD1000000047_S0000094	but of course people are then trying to take that approach which i think has been extremely beneficial and healthy and move it into other areas now how can you do it so people are trying to do with the environment you know how can we measure the value of a tree well people are trying to measure the value of a tree
POD1000000047_S0000095	and about what the trees were quite a lot
POD1000000047_S0000097	work out all these different trying to measure the benefit of a healthy sustainable environment the value of a species that is the value of this
POD1000000047_S0000098	i mean it seems it is too easy to sit back and say 0 you can not do it you can not measure that well you can have a good go you can have a good go so as you say it is always a balance between trying your best realizing you are never going to be able to do it
POD1000000047_S0000099	but not to be put off having a good go so it is like a lot of things we do in statistics trying to measure things trying to model things that we always know what we do is inadequate but that does not mean you can not do useful things
POD1000000047_S0000101	can you tell us a bit more about nice and how they prioritize health treatments within the united kingdom
POD1000000047_S0000102	yeah i mean that is something i have worked on a medical statistician been a huge supporter of nice and essentially what they what they do is when they decide whether to decide whether to have a new vaccine or whether to decide to have a new recommend
POD1000000047_S0000103	for drugs to be paid for under the nhs for example they will look at what is the expected benefit of that of that intervention and what is the expected cost and then they look at how much it is going to cost to
POD1000000047_S0000104	provide an extra what they call a quality quality adjusted life year so one year of life that is discounted if it is poor quality you will you will you will discount it will not be worth a whole year and then essentially they can make the comparison
POD1000000047_S0000105	and they look if something comes in at less than £20000 a qualey just almost is paid for you know just yeah fine we will pay for it under the nhs if it is more than about 30000 then they really try
POD1000000047_S0000107	we do not want to pay for
POD1000000047_S0000108	and try to go back to the drug company to renegotiate a price example between 50000 well you know that is that is more in the gray zone so and this has been enormously beneficial partly
POD1000000047_S0000109	in order to go back to drug companies and get them to reduce their prices but and also to see that some interventions for example cancer screening come in extremely cheap they are just worth doing it also means you have to be explicit for example on how much you value the future
POD1000000047_S0000110	rather than the present because they put in a discount rate currently 3.5% now that means that you know a year of life in 25 years time for example is only worth about half what a year of life now is worth and that is taken into account
POD1000000047_S0000111	and now that that of course is controversial and if we were talking about big policy decisions for example about climate change that is far too big a discount rate we would not care less about the world in a 100 years time if we use that discount rate so in different areas
POD1000000047_S0000112	might be wanting to use a different dis distance but these are taking economic ideas and moving them into very human decisions
POD1000000047_S0000113	and i think they are enormously helpful and illuminating but they are never perfect
POD1000000047_S0000115	yeah i have actually written an article with professor toby ord about why we should not discount health even though we should discount financial returns about why why it is appropriate in one case and not in the other so we will put up a link to that on the website so
POD1000000047_S0000116	a lot of people who are planning out their careers they feel just overwhelmed by uncertainty they do not know how much they are going to earn in one career or what is the chances of getting into academia or being elected to parliament
POD1000000047_S0000117	how do you think people ought to make decisions when they are just surrounded by so much uncertainty
POD1000000047_S0000118	well i mean you could say that we are always surrounded by this again this is common to everything we do we never know what is going to happen in the future which is great people do not do not want to know what is going to happen in the future people do not even know what they want what they are going to get for christmas let alone what is going to happen for the rest of their lives
POD1000000047_S0000119	and so this is just a common problem and we need to distinguish what we might call risk and uncertainty risk is when it is a very well defined problem short term issues buying lottery tickets when we know what the chances are
POD1000000047_S0000120	then we can sort of take a rational approach when we are dealing with deeper uncertainty when really i am not even sure what the options are what might how our lives might develop then it is very difficult to take a completely formal approach and so i would not
POD1000000047_S0000121	try to say 0 we should be able to do all this mathematically at all however the basics qualitative ideas of thinking through a rational decision are still very valuable because you think of you know what are the options available
POD1000000047_S0000122	what are the possibilities and you know what are the possible consequences of what i might do that is always inadequate you are never going to be able to think of everything however by thinking through that some things might become immediately apparent some immediate rankings
POD1000000047_S0000123	what is preferable and not preferable might become apparent and otherwise and you can we might need to fall back i think on on broader strategies for making decisions in the face of
POD1000000047_S0000124	what we call deeper uncertainty now this is a deeply contested area and when governments make policies very often they are in these situations where they can not even think of all the things that might happen and so they are they are in this situation deeper uncertainty
POD1000000047_S0000125	and people have suggested various ways to go about it the 1st thing is to not to think that you can optimize you can not be perfect you cannot be perfect so the sort of suggestions that people make in terms of general decision making in these contexts
POD1000000047_S0000126	to do with flexibility and resilience that you want to be you want you do not want to commit yourself to something not going to be able to change because you can not predict everything that is going to happen you want to build in flexibility and adaptivity to your decision
POD1000000047_S0000127	that is the same in any business any government any any project at all and the other thing is to building resilience in which you are essentially can cope with the unexpected things and that means both you know the possibility of really good things happen
POD1000000047_S0000128	as well as the possibility of really bad things happening that you are making sure that you have not put all your eggs in one basket essentially something goes wrong you have completely gone up a total blind alley that you can not renegotiate
POD1000000047_S0000129	which means operating from a basis most robust basis as possible so it means not trying to optimize the single path but building in robustness which means i think in terms of career of course building in
POD1000000047_S0000130	transferable skills that you are going to be able to use in a variety of circumstances so i think these are standard tactics for responding to deeper uncertainty which can be used in any situation
POD1000000047_S0000132	yeah that is definitely something that the organization 80000 hours who advises people on you know how to have a big impact with their careers really focused on is especially early in your career like keep your options open choose things that are robust under you know lots of different possible things happening
POD1000000047_S0000134	one other question that we find we come up against a fair amount in thinking about careers and charities and all kinds of things is you know how do you go about choosing between a small chance of some really huge outcome like you know saving the world from a pandemic that kills 10s
POD1000000047_S0000136	against some high probability of a very moderate or more moderate outcome so you know helping people in your local community this seems like a very difficult thing to deal with do you have any thoughts on how people can go about making these kinds of decisions
POD1000000047_S0000137	yeah very difficult but again these are common decisions in our always in our lives do we go for the high risk option or the safer or the safer option and i personally think that
POD1000000047_S0000138	actually you know a mixed strategy is something that businesses i think would recommend although that is not what i am not involved in in any investment decisions but often you know i think people would take an idea of a portfolio
POD1000000047_S0000139	risk taking because these are all risks you know you can not guarantee the benefits from anything to do these are all risks and so that you might you know have a certain amount invested in rather safe things with safe return you are pretty sure
POD1000000047_S0000140	what you are going to do is going to have a reasonable return and you really can predict the consequences of what you are using your career or your money for what you are giving for and on the other hand on more speculative
POD1000000047_S0000141	where you may be supporting something that might not come to know come to come to anything either because the solution is promising
POD1000000047_S0000142	will not work or the threat will not arise in the 1st place so i think that a mixed strategy in these circumstances again you know i would not want to just put all the eggs in one basket
POD1000000047_S0000144	would not be appropriate i also personally feel that is completely my personal reaction given is that i quite like a mix strategy in which some things are the bigger
POD1000000047_S0000146	slightly anonymous
POD1000000047_S0000147	well you are giving money
POD1000000047_S0000149	large organization that is doing something which is contributing in probably fairly predictable way to improving things for people versus you know the more personal ones where you do have the person
POD1000000047_S0000150	contact and you might get slightly more sort of emotional feedback from that partly because that might encourage you to perhaps take on more good feedback from your altruism might encourage you to take on bigger
POD1000000047_S0000151	bigger commitment
POD1000000047_S0000153	so there are various ways of thinking about how to quantify the risks or possible gains associated with an activity can you explain what a micromort or a micro life is
POD1000000047_S0000154	0 yeah yeah these are units that well reinvented the microlife someone else invented the micromort is it is just a way trying to get a common scale for in this particular case micromorts acute risks the things that might kill you on the spot but otherwise you are healthy
POD1000000047_S0000155	and it is a one in a 10 chance of dying because of an action you might take so skydiving or something is approximately 710 micromorts and microlife which is something to do with chronic risks which is the risk of
POD1000000047_S0000156	i think stuff i am quite interested in which is bad lifestyle lack of exercise or smoking or drinking or bad diet or whatever which is not going to kill you on the spot but
POD1000000047_S0000157	will she is likely to shorten your life not definitely at all maybe not but probably will and so it is a reduction of half an hour in your life expectancy and i find these quite useful because it enables you to compare all these different
POD1000000047_S0000158	things like diet and smoking and exercise and things and make me for example think obviously smoking is where you get the biggest return or the biggest you know in terms of not smoking the huge biggest return
POD1000000047_S0000160	drinking at low doses well actually it does not make much difference
POD1000000047_S0000162	huge huge concern unless you are really setting it down but exercise again i think is extremely important and diet is important and and
POD1000000047_S0000163	it just gives you a feeling of what is where the you know where the priorities are which of course it is all a bit obvious they are the priorities that people do in public health but it makes you slightly unconcerned about other things that people might be really concerned
POD1000000047_S0000165	so these these concepts were invented to help people get a better understanding and make better decisions do you think that we could invent new concepts to help people think about how they can do more good in the world
POD1000000047_S0000167	yeah you know micro altra
POD1000000047_S0000169	it is difficult i mean the quality is is a good one if you are really if your if your area of causes is to do with saving lives improving health and lethal risk to people then quality is a good one it is already established you can look at how
POD1000000047_S0000171	how many years of life are you going to gain for from your intervention and we know that you know if you are giving money to some particular charities
POD1000000047_S0000173	promote
POD1000000047_S0000174	you know they are extremely cost effective in that way
POD1000000047_S0000175	it is more difficult if you have a broader idea for example of supporting education preserving the natural environment and so on quite how to put a number on that within within a particular area of cause
POD1000000047_S0000176	cause then you might want to do it but having metrics
POD1000000047_S0000178	right across different
POD1000000047_S0000180	is is difficult and i know that you know people criticize
POD1000000047_S0000182	attempts to do it
POD1000000047_S0000183	i still think it is worth trying to do and and people are struggling to do this
POD1000000047_S0000185	within the environment and so on now i do not think i have got any great idea to be honest to i mean one possibility of course is
POD1000000047_S0000186	is looking at general measures of well being which again people are doing it is measured by national governments now to try to measure wellbeing in terms of how people feel about about their lives and
POD1000000047_S0000187	general wellbeing in the season which are not just health related length of life related i think you have got great potential but it is not going to you are not going to be able to get the perfect measure
POD1000000047_S0000188	so people are often asked you know how would you rate how good your life is going from one to 10 you know typically they give answers between 6 and 8 at least in the u k
POD1000000047_S0000189	maybe we could have a micro happy which would be something as good as moving someone from 6 to 7 or 7 to 8 on this welfare scale
POD1000000047_S0000190	yeah exactly i think that you know those scales well actually i find them very revealing when people do measure particular across cultures as you said
POD1000000047_S0000192	everyone says so
POD1000000047_S0000194	number 7 but it also reflects this idea is not bad you know
POD1000000047_S0000195	must not grumble
POD1000000047_S0000197	you know could be better but must not grumble you know slightly british stoic attitude in these things so i think it is almost predictable what people are going to respond but i find for example the age distribution of these responses and how the age distribution varies across cultures
POD1000000047_S0000198	extremely interesting and the idea of you know whether one could move
POD1000000047_S0000200	groups of people on that scale would be very important and when i think of sort of charities some of the ones i get to
POD1000000047_S0000201	which are not directly i do not think going to actually make people live longer but you would hope to would improve people is well being and sense of happiness considerably
POD1000000047_S0000202	yeah it is a fascinating area of research and there are significant international differences so i think in the uk and america and australia people do tend to give 7 or maybe 8 if they are feeling particularly good but in south america people are just for some reason more exuberant
POD1000000047_S0000203	and tend to often give 8 even when they are relatively poor and by contrast in eastern europe and eastern asia like japan and china people tend to give relatively low scores relative to how life there seems there seems to be going from the outside
POD1000000047_S0000204	yeah yeah yeah no people different cultures i think in africa they are even lower people very
POD1000000047_S0000206	yeah there are some countries that where the average is as low as 4 out of 10 which maybe half of people are getting less than 4 which is a bit unfortunate
POD1000000047_S0000207	but again i mean these are they are very culturally i think specific and so but i think what one wants to see is is relative changes relative changes perhaps you know compared with
POD1000000047_S0000208	the average in that in that community that that you know you can not just let everyone get everyone up to 8 or whatever i mean there are different very different cultural attitudes to do with i think that are reflected in those questions
POD1000000047_S0000209	yeah so by trying to estimate risk or the size of problems in this quantitative way do you think we risk being biased against approaches that are harder to quantify
POD1000000047_S0000210	yeah it always is a problem that people start believing that the model the measure which is only a very inadequate thing starts trying starts becoming the thing that you are in fact then trying to you know you focus on
POD1000000047_S0000211	to the detriment of all others and there is a real problem with over you know metric sing any activity pretending that you can measure the benefits of every
POD1000000047_S0000213	academic role of course there is a
POD1000000047_S0000214	real example of that where people start getting obsessed with impact factors and nonsense like that so there is there is a real danger with with believing these things too much at the same time
POD1000000047_S0000215	i think we should have done good goat trying to do it and you know just because something is is difficult and cannot be done perfectly does not mean that you can not at least have have a stab at it because you may
POD1000000047_S0000217	now often
POD1000000047_S0000218	these things get really clear rankings you know great precision might not be required in order to determine that actually this is not not an effective use of resources compared with me
POD1000000047_S0000220	yeah and i think that rather than giving us a perfect answer to all questions using you know models and looking at different factors can as you say just help you to identify like clear differences or areas where you need to get more information because you just have no idea how to factor that in
POD1000000047_S0000221	something so it can definitely be very useful and finally just to what extent do you think that the average person can benefit from a better understanding of statistics learning more statistics you know either in their everyday lives or in being more effective as altruists
POD1000000047_S0000222	and to what extent do you think i guess relating back to the past question it could potentially limit us
POD1000000047_S0000224	yeah i think i think yeah of course i do of course i would say this would not but yeah i do believe that people would benefit from having a greater idea of stats and measurement and number and quantity
POD1000000047_S0000225	and and the frailties of that as well because the point about understanding statistics is both to understand their strength and their weaknesses the 2 are absolutely hand in hand and what people tend to do at the moment who are not suppose not confident
POD1000000047_S0000226	with with numbers and how they are constructed because in the end the whole are always constructed someone has chosen what to measure and is that they tend to either accept them as if they are god given truth and that is the number and that is so vital
POD1000000047_S0000227	and that is it that is what we are looking for or reject them out of hand 0 you can not put numbers
POD1000000047_S0000229	alien statistics and this sort of nonsense and that sort of those 2 extreme views are both equally the
POD1000000047_S0000231	but if you have got a slightly more nuanced view you will realize that statistics and numbers and measurements are incredibly valuable tool but they are just a tool and they they have their frailties and inadequacies so you both need
POD1000000047_S0000233	teach and understand the strength and the limitations and i am involved in a number of educational projects in which we are trying to do just
POD1000000047_S0000235	so it is really a matter of trying to assign the appropriate weight to each different kind of evidence or each different piece of evidence that comes your way
POD1000000047_S0000236	i think i mean in the end that what statistics is to do with its quantitative evidence that is what that is what we are talking about and and evidence can be good bad or you know along a whole scale it is not a true or false
POD1000000047_S0000237	it is just evidence and you are trying to weigh up that evidence which we do all the time in our lives we do this but you know our guts tend to be a bit fallible when it comes to weighing up evidence
POD1000000047_S0000239	influenced by certain salient things that will attract our attention and so actually standing back and trying to be a bit cooler about weighing up evidence i think is a really valuable thing to try to do in all areas of life it does not matter what
POD1000000047_S0000240	yeah absolutely which is not to say that you should completely discount that gut feeling but often just supplement it with some extra evidence or statistics
POD1000000047_S0000241	
POD1000000047_S0000243	i do not trust him a bit but i still you know go with them
POD1000000047_S0000244	yeah i think that is about all we have got time for now but thanks so much david this has been very informative and really interesting
POD1000000047_S0000245	okay thanks very much

POD1000000048_S0000001	hi i am rob director of research at 80000 hours today i am speaking with miles brundige research fellow at the university of oxford is future of humanity institute
POD1000000048_S0000002	he studies the social implications surrounding the development of new technologies and has a particular interest in artificial general intelligence that is an ai system that could do most or all of the tasks humans could do
POD1000000048_S0000003	miles research has been supported by the national science foundation the bipartisan policy center and the future of life institute thanks for making time to talk to us today miles
POD1000000048_S0000004	thanks for having me
POD1000000048_S0000005	so 1st up maybe just tell us a bit about your background and what questions you are looking into at the moment
POD1000000048_S0000007	sure so i used to work on energy policy when i was living in washington dc and i have gradually moved into ai policy over the past few years because it seems like it was more of a neglected area and could have a very large impact
POD1000000048_S0000008	so i recently started at the future of humanity institute and i am also concurrently finishing up my phd in human and social dimensions of science and technology at arizona state university
POD1000000048_S0000009	so in both capacities i am interested in what sorts of methods would be useful for thinking about ai in a rigorous way and particularly the uncertainty of possible futures surrounding ai
POD1000000048_S0000010	and i have a few more specific interests such as openness and artificial intelligence and the risks related to bad actors
POD1000000048_S0000011	okay so are you trying to predict what is going to happen and when and what sort of effect it will have
POD1000000048_S0000012	so not necessarily predict per se but at least understand what is plausible i think that it is very difficult to predict with any high confidence what is going to happen and when
POD1000000048_S0000013	but understanding for example what sorts of actions people could carry out with ai systems today or in the foreseeable future in different domains like cybersecurity
POD1000000048_S0000014	and information operations production of fake news automatically and autonomous drones and so forth
POD1000000048_S0000015	i think understanding the security landscape of those sorts of things does not necessarily require very detailed forecast of when exactly something will occur so much as understanding what is technologically possible given near term trends
POD1000000048_S0000017	you do not necessarily have to say this is when the this particular accident or malicious behavior will occur but just that these are the sorts of risks that we need to be prepared for
POD1000000048_S0000018	right right does that bring you into contact with with organizations that are developing ai like like google
POD1000000048_S0000020	yeah absolutely so those organizations have an interest in making sure that ai is as beneficial as possible
POD1000000048_S0000022	keenly aware of the fact that they can be misused and that there might be accident risks associated with
POD1000000048_S0000023	so for example held a workshop fairly recently on the connection between bad actors and ai and what sorts of bad actors we might be concerned about in this space and we had some participation from some of those groups
POD1000000048_S0000024	right right what kinds of bad actors are you thinking of
POD1000000048_S0000025	i think there you can look at it from a number of different perspectives so depending on the domain that you are interested in you might end up with different sorts of actors
POD1000000048_S0000026	in the case of physical harm associated with ai you might look at autonomous weapons and the weaponization of consumer drones and in that case it is something that would be particularly appealing to state actors as well as terrorists
POD1000000048_S0000027	we are already seeing the weaponization of consumer drones though without much autonomy if any in the case of isis overseas
POD1000000048_S0000028	so there there are cases like that where we can foresee that particular groups with when given more advanced capabilities such as higher baseline levels of autonomy and consumer drones
POD1000000048_S0000029	would like would be able to and would like to carry out damage on a larger scale
POD1000000048_S0000030	but in other cases it is less clear so for example there are concerns around mass surveillance and it is often not totally clear whether one should be more concerned about states or corporations
POD1000000048_S0000031	depending on what sorts of risk you are concerned about for example corporations currently have a lot of data on people
POD1000000048_S0000032	there is there has been a lot of concerns raised about the use of ai to make decisions that have critical impacts on people is lives
POD1000000048_S0000033	denying loans and court decisions and so forth that are being informed by often not very transparent algorithms
POD1000000048_S0000034	so those are some concerns but there is also potentially different class of concerns around authoritarian states using ai for oppression
POD1000000048_S0000035	so it is i think there is a range of risks but generally speaking there is going to be a steady increase in the the the floor of the scale level as these ai technologies diffuse
POD1000000048_S0000036	that is there will be more and more capabilities available to people at the bottom of the scale that is individuals as well as people with more access to computing power and money and data at the higher end
POD1000000048_S0000037	so it is not totally clear how to think about that because on the one hand you might expect that
POD1000000048_S0000038	the the biggest actors are the most concerning because they have the most skills and resources but on the other hand they also are sometimes in the case of democratic governments
POD1000000048_S0000039	held accountable to citizens and in the case of corporations held accountable to stakeholders you might also think that you would be more concerned about individual rogue actors
POD1000000048_S0000040	that that is an issue i am still trying to think through in the in the context of the report that i am writing based on that workshop
POD1000000048_S0000041	right so people often distinguish between kind of the short term risks from ai like self driving cars not working properly or algorithmic bias
POD1000000048_S0000042	and then then the longer term concerns of what we are going to do once an artificial intelligence is as smart as humans or potentially much much more intelligent which which one of those do you spend more time working on
POD1000000048_S0000043	i try to focus on issues that span different time horizons so i think ai and security is something that we are already seeing some early instances of today
POD1000000048_S0000044	it is already being used for detection of cyber threats for example and the production of vulnerabilities in software there is a lot of research going on
POD1000000048_S0000045	with an example being the darpa grand cyber cyber grand challenge recently where there was automated hacking and automated defense
POD1000000048_S0000046	so there is already stuff happening on the front of ai insecurity as well as the economics of ai and issues surrounding privacy
POD1000000048_S0000047	but it is it is not totally clear whether the issues in the future will just be straightforward extensions of those or whether there will be qualitatively different
POD1000000048_S0000049	think it is important to think about what is happening today and imagine how it might progressively develop into a more extreme future as well as to think about possible discontinuities when ai progresses more quickly
POD1000000048_S0000050	right right so i should say at this point that we have a profile up on our website about the the potential upsides and downsides of artificial intelligence where we go through all of the basics
POD1000000048_S0000051	and miles you have a forthcoming guide to work on ai policy and strategy that that we are going to link to so so here we are going to try to go go beyond that so if you find yourself a little bit confused then potentially just go and read one of those one of those documents 1st
POD1000000048_S0000052	so so which policy or strategy questions do you see as as most important for us to answer in order to ensure that the development of artificial intelligence goes goes well rather than in a bad way
POD1000000048_S0000053	i think there are a lot of questions and some of the ones i was talking about earlier surrounding security and preventing the weaponization of ai by dangerous actors is is one
POD1000000048_S0000054	but one and there are also other issues that have been widely discussed in the media and by academics such as accountability of algorithms and transparency the economic impacts of ai and so forth
POD1000000048_S0000055	but one that i think is particularly important particularly over the long over the long term and this is a case where there might be a need to think about possible discontinuities
POD1000000048_S0000056	is coordination surrounding ai safety so there has been a lot of attention called to ai safety in the past few years and there is starting to be a lot of concrete and successful research on the problem of avoiding certain ai safety failure mode
POD1000000048_S0000057	like wire heading and value misalignment and so forth but there has been less attention paid to how do you actually incentivize people to act on the the best practices and the the good theoretical frameworks that are developed
POD1000000048_S0000058	assuming that they will be developed and that is a potentially big problem if there is a competitive situation between companies or between countries or both and there is an incentive to skimp on those safety measures
POD1000000048_S0000059	so there has been a little bit of work for example by armstrong at all at the future of humanity institute looking at arms race type scenarios involving ai where there would be an incentive to skimp
POD1000000048_S0000060	because you are concerned about losing the lead in an ai race and there might be significant we do not really know what the extent will
POD1000000048_S0000061	it might turn out that there are significant tradeoffs between safety and performance of ai systems so one might be tempted to in order to gain an advantage whether economic or military or intelligence wise
POD1000000048_S0000062	ramp up the capabilities of an ai system by adding more hardware adding more data adding more sensors and effectors and so forth but that might actually be dangerous if you do not understand the the full behavioral envelope of the system
POD1000000048_S0000063	so to speak and how to constrain actors the human actors from doing that is a very difficult problem
POD1000000048_S0000064	so i have along with some others at the future of humanity institute and others at different organizations have started thinking about what is an incentive compatible mechanism to ensure
POD1000000048_S0000065	that people do the right thing in that case that is to say we do not want to ask people to do something that is totally against their interests
POD1000000048_S0000066	if they actually do have an interest in developing these systems and protecting themselves militarily or otherwise but we also want to ensure that they are constrained in some sort of way
POD1000000048_S0000067	so one example would be an arrangement this is not necessarily a fully fleshed out example but just to illustrate the sort of thing i am talking about
POD1000000048_S0000068	would be some sort of arrangement between ai developers such that in order to gain access to the latest breakthroughs or the latest computing power
POD1000000048_S0000069	you would need to submit to some sort of safety monitoring and and adhere to certain best practices
POD1000000048_S0000070	that would create an incentive if you want to be on the cutting edge to to participate in those safety protocols so that again that is not a fully worked out example
POD1000000048_S0000071	that is that is the class of things that is an example of the class of things that i would like to see more of developing specific proposals for how to ensure that the right thing that is being developed on the technical front actually gets implemented
POD1000000048_S0000072	right you look much at say what governments should be doing in this area whether there is regulations that we should be putting in place or at least preparing to put in place in future
POD1000000048_S0000073	yeah so i think that that ties in with what i was saying a little bit in that one might envision that as ai capabilities develop
POD1000000048_S0000074	it will be increasingly seen as a matter of national security that a country be on the the leading edge so i think it is it is not super clear how to navigate that yet
POD1000000048_S0000075	i think there is some there is some low hanging fruit so clearly in my opinion it would be beneficial for countries to have some experts in house in their governments who actually know something about ai
POD1000000048_S0000076	and are able to deal with crises as they arise if they arise and to be able to think carefully about the impacts of ai on the labor force for example
POD1000000048_S0000077	so i think there there is some low hanging fruit and some policies that have been developed for dealing with some of the near term issues but for the longer term issues
POD1000000048_S0000078	it is not super clear that we want to rush into into a situation where governments are leading this if if that would turn out to only accentuate the the arms race dynamics
POD1000000048_S0000079	we should be trying to avoid if if it is ai is seen even more as a national security issue in an un unhelpful way
POD1000000048_S0000080	so i think it is incumbent on those who are thinking about the long term policy issues around ai to develop a more positive proposal that involves not just
POD1000000048_S0000081	you know the u s government getting involved for the purpose of accelerating american ai capabilities
POD1000000048_S0000082	but some more collaborative approach
POD1000000048_S0000083	yeah i suppose with with previous dangerous technologies like like nuclear weapons or chemical or biological weapons there is there has been agreements to try to slow down their development and deployment is that something that could potentially happen here at the international level
POD1000000048_S0000085	i think it is possible to imagine some sort of slowing down among a small number of actors
POD1000000048_S0000086	we are fortunate that there is a high concentration of computing power and talent and skill in a fairly small number of organizations
POD1000000048_S0000087	there is pretty much no chance of some random person outcompeting the top organizations at ai in a surprising way
POD1000000048_S0000088	so it is possible that you know with with some of the top companies and non profits as well as countries they could coordinate in some sort of way
POD1000000048_S0000089	not to postpone ai across society for a long period of time but at least to be cautious in the later stages of development and to allow time for mutual vetting of of safety procedures and things like that
POD1000000048_S0000090	so i think it is possible to imagine some sort of coordination but the the technical and the political factors interact to a large extent
POD1000000048_S0000091	to the extent that we actually have good safety measures that are efficient and that do not introduce a lot of overhead computational or otherwise into these systems
POD1000000048_S0000092	then we will be in a better place to actually get people to coordinate because it will not be imposing a lot of costs on them and likewise to the extent that we are able to coordinate better
POD1000000048_S0000093	it will will be in a better position to actually get people to implement those those mechanisms if they do impose some performance penalty
POD1000000048_S0000094	right so can you think of like any major bit of progress we have made on ai strategy questions over the last couple of years
POD1000000048_S0000095	so the example i mentioned of the paper by armstrong at all called racing to the precipice is is one example and it presented sort of a stark version of the arms race scenario
POD1000000048_S0000096	i think you know there are reasons to be more optimistic than than are presented in that paper because you know they look at only a certain set of assumptions as with any model
POD1000000048_S0000097	but more generally i think there has been progress in the development of principles and and criteria for good policies in recent years so for example with the asilomar conference and the set of asilomar ai principles
POD1000000048_S0000098	i think that was a good step towards developing some shared understanding around the need to avoid arms races and concerns over ai weaponization and so forth
POD1000000048_S0000099	but it is i still think that there is a lot of room for
POD1000000048_S0000100	progress to be made so there was a paper put out by the future of humanity institute by nick bostrom carlin and ali alan defee recently that looks at policy desiderata for the development of machine superintelligence
POD1000000048_S0000101	and there is a lot of good material there but i think they would be the 1st to admit that we are still at the the high level principle stage of developing these policies
POD1000000048_S0000102	we have a better understanding of what we want to avoid than than we did a few years ago and what sorts of what what a good proposed policy proposal would look like
POD1000000048_S0000103	but we do not yet have anything super actionable so i think the situation is a bit analogous to where ai safety was a few years ago
POD1000000048_S0000104	where there were there was starting to be an articulation of what the problem was with the book super intelligence and various other publications
POD1000000048_S0000105	and people were starting to take the problem seriously and started to have a vocabulary for what what a solution would look like with value alignment and other terms being coined
POD1000000048_S0000106	but there was not yet any concrete research agenda and you know subsequently there have been a lot of concrete research agendas
POD1000000048_S0000107	well as technical progress on some parts of those research agendas with work by open ai and deep mind and others leading the way
POD1000000048_S0000108	so i think that we are potentially in a similarly exciting phase on the policy front where we have a decent understanding of what the problem is and with the example of avoiding arms races being forefront in my mind
POD1000000048_S0000109	least but we do not yet have a concrete we do not have you know clear models and case studies that we can point to as as ways forward
POD1000000048_S0000110	i think that is the next step is moving into more concrete proposals and trying to balance some of the tradeoffs that have been identified in recent papers
POD1000000048_S0000112	so it seems like excuse me seems like a lot of the latest thinking in this area is not written up in public yet partly because people do not do not want to you know publicize their views at this point or just because the it takes a long time to get papers published
POD1000000048_S0000113	what do you think is the best way for someone who is interested in working in the area to get up to speed on the issues
POD1000000048_S0000114	so i think again it is somewhat analogous to the situation with you know ai safety a few years ago and i think the book super intelligence was a big step forward on that front in terms of having a single reference to point people to
POD1000000048_S0000115	but it is less clear if there is one single reference to point people to on ai policy issues though i am hoping hoping that the career guide that i am working on will be somewhat useful in that regard
POD1000000048_S0000116	another resource that comes to mind is a syllabus for a class on the global politics of ai developed by alan do at yale and the future of humanity institute
POD1000000048_S0000117	that that is a very detailed list of resources and i am sure there will be a link provided for this interview somewhere
POD1000000048_S0000118	
POD1000000048_S0000119	yeah so i think that is that is another set of resources so it is essentially a long list of both formal academic publications as well as things in the more gray literature
POD1000000048_S0000120	such as blog posts which is i think the sort of thing you are referring to is things that are not necessarily written up academically but are you know somewhat accessible but even there there is still some things like google docs that are used internally and so forth
POD1000000048_S0000121	i think if if based on reading those sorts of things this is clearly something you are interested in then the obvious next step is just to get in touch with people who are working on these issues and and ask and you know indicate what your interests are
POD1000000048_S0000122	there might be things that are not available online that they can point you to
POD1000000048_S0000123	yeah you mentioned the asilomar statement of of principles which just want to describe that
POD1000000048_S0000124	sure so
POD1000000048_S0000125	2 years ago there was a conference on beneficial ai held in puerto rico and that led to an open an open letter on ai
POD1000000048_S0000126	and subsequently some investment by elon musk in the future of life institute which supported a lot of grants in this space
POD1000000048_S0000127	and i think that that led to a lot of attention to the issue and there were 1000s of people including a lot of ai scientists who signed on to that letter
POD1000000048_S0000128	and then subsequently the asilomar ai principles which were developed at a conference 2 years later this year at asilomar in california
POD1000000048_S0000129	developed a more specific set of proposals for what sorts of things ai scientists should be thinking about so not just you know the fact that there should be more research but also things like capability caution
POD1000000048_S0000130	so being attentive to the fact that we do not know for sure what the upper limits of ai capabilities will ultimately be
POD1000000048_S0000131	and the things i mentioned about avoiding arms races and being concerned about ai weaponization more broadly so i think that is a good example of developing you know sort of a consensus view on what
POD1000000048_S0000132	what we want to see and what we do not want to see we want to see ai benefiting society as a whole and we do not want to see it leading to the accruing of benefits to a small number of people or to large scale war or anything like that
POD1000000048_S0000133	and i think it is it is encouraging to see not just that but also the development of other set of principles through the triple in their their effort on ethically aligned ai design
POD1000000048_S0000134	so i read those those principles and they and they they seemed quite strong on paper do you think people are likely to follow through on them
POD1000000048_S0000135	i think i think there is somewhat of a gap between the level of abstraction of the principles and concrete steps that people can take
POD1000000048_S0000136	so for example it is not totally clear what any individual can can do to stop an arms race for example but i think it is a step in the right direction to know where where you are headed
POD1000000048_S0000137	then you know figuring out exactly what to do about that is is the next step
POD1000000048_S0000138	yeah so in your guide you suggest that people could potentially work on ai strategy and policy questions at places like google deepmind openai where where artificial intelligence is actually being developed
POD1000000048_S0000139	what concretely could you see people doing at places like that if they took a job there
POD1000000048_S0000140	yeah so to some extent people at those organizations are are doing something fairly similar to what i and my colleagues are doing in academia
POD1000000048_S0000141	is thinking about what the problems are and trying to develop solutions i think the the benefit of being on that side of things is to have more direct exposure to what is happening on the ground so to speak
POD1000000048_S0000142	in ai development and i think that can be useful for developing a set of what sorts of problems are actually cropping up as a result of the development of capabilities that actually exist as opposed to just ones in the future
POD1000000048_S0000143	though i think it is also notable that people at these organizations have been very active in the efforts that i have mentioned such as raising attention to ai safety
POD1000000048_S0000144	which was an initiative that involved people at google brain and open ai and the concrete problems and ai safety paper
POD1000000048_S0000145	and people at deepmind have been very influential in in calling for more ai safety work and they have been publishing fairly early on this matter relative to other organizations
POD1000000048_S0000146	i think there is a lot of reason to think that these organizations are playing a positive role and i think it is it would be a good place to be involved in sort of thought thought leadership on these
POD1000000048_S0000147	as well as doing direct research
POD1000000048_S0000149	and how hard is it to to get a job at a place like
POD1000000048_S0000151	i imagine they would only have a few people working on ai strategy policy are these extremely competitive roles
POD1000000048_S0000152	i would say they are pretty competitive and i think that is that is you know a general phenomenon in anything related to ai these days you know whether on the policy side or the technical side
POD1000000048_S0000153	but i think that this is a growth area for sure so if if one develops expertise on this topic and has something to contribute
POD1000000048_S0000154	i think there will ultimately be opportunities available to you in the next few years
POD1000000048_S0000155	again i want to draw an analogy to ai safety where there was a lot of concern about you know will there be jobs in ai safety you know 3 years or so ago and i think that deterred some grad students from working in this space
POD1000000048_S0000156	now the situation seems to look a bit better in that there is a fair number of advertisements for postdocs and people being hired at top top labs to work on these issues
POD1000000048_S0000157	so i think we will probably see something pretty similar not necessarily becoming not competitive but you know there being a little bit of slackening over time as as there is a need for developing larger teams to work on these topics
POD1000000048_S0000159	and another path you have talked about is going into politics or policy roles for example as a congressional staffer or perhaps at a think tank like the brookings institute or the national science foundation potentially just going into party politics in general
POD1000000048_S0000160	what useful things do you envisage people could do there
POD1000000048_S0000162	yeah so i think in the same way that working at an ai lab would give you a better sense of what is practical on the technical front
POD1000000048_S0000163	working for congress or parliament or you know a political party would give you a better sense of what is practical on the political front
POD1000000048_S0000164	so in addition to that developing a better intuition for the the system that you are dealing with and what what the constraints are
POD1000000048_S0000165	i think it is also potentially a good way to to actually influence what what is actually done by those bodies
POD1000000048_S0000166	so for example in the u s congress right now there was just recently announced an ai caucus to organize the discussion of members of congress on issues related to ai
POD1000000048_S0000167	with particular focus on issues related to the future of work but i think over time we will see more discussion of of the longer term sorts of issues
POD1000000048_S0000168	that we have been talking about in in those fora and it would be useful to have people who are concerned about making sure that the right thing is is ultimately done working in those places
POD1000000048_S0000169	able to actually act on the best the best current understanding developed by researchers and by practitioners
POD1000000048_S0000170	yeah so i think a big risk of going into politics or policy in general would be that your career progresses but you are not specifically in one of the places that ends up you know having a say in how these things go
POD1000000048_S0000171	you just end up you know being you know working in a in a congressional committee that turns out not to be that relevant are there any role that you can take early on or what can you do to make to position yourself well so that you do not just get sidelined in the end
POD1000000048_S0000173	i think if you intend to work in politics then you have to be somewhat opportunistic about jobs and the ebb and flow of of political opportunities so for example
POD1000000048_S0000174	if you know 11 congressional committee is declining in its relevance in terms of ai then one should consider about you know jumping ship toward somewhere that is more relevant
POD1000000048_S0000175	so i do not think that you know taking one particular job will lock you in forever but building up some political capital and some human capital in that area could be useful
POD1000000048_S0000176	even if you ultimately want to switch to a different organization but i would push back a little bit on the idea of you know not not being relevant just because you are not at the on the side of people
POD1000000048_S0000177	you are not at the at the organization where people are developing the latest ai i mean as i as i mentioned before i think that is a very exciting opportunity and you know along with academia it is it is a great great place to work on these issues
POD1000000048_S0000178	but governments still play an important role in framing these issues and in convening discussions
POD1000000048_S0000179	an example of an example of this would be the preparing for the future of artificial intelligence report put out by the white house office of science and technology policy last year
POD1000000048_S0000180	which you know was the result of 4 workshops that brought together experts in a wide variety of areas in law and economics and ai technology and safety
POD1000000048_S0000181	and so i think you still have an opportunity to frame the discussion and move the ball forward even if you are not working in in the latest labs
POD1000000048_S0000182	yeah so what would be some of the best places to to apply to in that area
POD1000000048_S0000183	so it is it is a bit tricky to answer that in general it depends on factors like what your citizenship is and what what particular policy issues you are interested in
POD1000000048_S0000184	but some fairly robust recommendations would be to look for for for for a particular class of people that have technical backgrounds
POD1000000048_S0000185	one area to look at would be triple a fellowship so the american american association for the advancement of science has a fellowship program
POD1000000048_S0000186	where they essentially put people in rotations in organizations like congress and the executive branch where they can implement some of some of they can you know draw on their technical experience
POD1000000048_S0000187	and someone with a background in ai would probably end up in an ai relevant organization so i have heard a lot of good things about that being a good good way to develop career capital and experience and an understanding of how the political system works
POD1000000048_S0000188	but that is not necessarily you know going to result in being in the exact right location for for you know solving ai policy problems the next few months
POD1000000048_S0000189	i think it is really hard to say where where that would be or even if there is such a place because i think we are still
POD1000000048_S0000190	despite all the progress that is being made in a relatively early stage so there there is not even yet a recommendation there is not even yet a nomination for the director of the office of science and technology policy in the white house
POD1000000048_S0000191	so otherwise i would say that that is a good place to go so and likewise we do not really know what the agenda of the trump administration is on the front
POD1000000048_S0000192	and there is a lot of there is a lot of discussion but not much institution building in in governments at the moment so it is hard for me to answer that in general
POD1000000048_S0000193	but i think getting experience is a pretty robust thing to do
POD1000000048_S0000194	right right so a situation that i encounter reasonably often is that i meet someone who is really smart who is very interested in this topic who might be able to make a great contribution
POD1000000048_S0000195	but at the moment they are just there are not that many groups that are that are hiring for these roles so you are at the future of humanity institute and i guess he is also the future of life institute but but there are not that many places that someone can potentially apply
POD1000000048_S0000196	so i am thinking what what advice should i should i give someone in that situation should they just should they continue studying perhaps or you know building expertise so that they are in a better position to to apply in future when when the number of positions grows or yeah
POD1000000048_S0000197	yeah i mean again it is hard to answer that in general depending on what what
POD1000000048_S0000198	background the person has and what sorts of jobs they are interested in but i think if one casts a fairly large net in terms of what ai issues one wants to work on there there is a fair fairly large range of organizations
POD1000000048_S0000199	not just it is not just there is also the center for the study of existential risk the leverhulme center for the future of intelligence the tech policy lab at the university of washington
POD1000000048_S0000200	and you know various faculty programs around the various academic programs around the country in the us and around the world are looking to hire people
POD1000000048_S0000201	for example as post or faculty member in in areas related to ai and policy if if you are some with an academic background
POD1000000048_S0000202	and there are probably a fair number of policy policy positions at tech companies that are not necessarily specific to ai but that would lead to getting valuable experience in the broad area of tech policy
POD1000000048_S0000203	so again you know one i guess to generalize a bit i would recommend casting a fairly large net and you know working in adjacent areas if you can not immediately work in the exact right right place
POD1000000048_S0000204	because this is not some this is not the sort of area where you know people have been working on ai policy for decades and you know it is hard to break in for that reason it is more just that it is it is still a field that is growing
POD1000000048_S0000205	and i do not think that that growth will stop so i think there will be more opportunities in the future but if if you can not find the right opportunity now
POD1000000048_S0000206	then then you know again talk to people in the field about what sorts of opportunities are on the horizon and try and work in adjacent fields that might be one thing to consider
POD1000000048_S0000207	yeah so what do you think would be the biggest challenges for someone setting out trying to start a career in this area
POD1000000048_S0000208	depending on one is background i think the the main challenge would be boning up on areas of weakness
POD1000000048_S0000209	for example if you have a policy background you might want to focus on learning more about ai and if you have a technical background you might want to focus more on learning about policy
POD1000000048_S0000210	i think one of the challenges challenges is what you mentioned before about there not being a super clearly accessible literature on the topic
POD1000000048_S0000211	i think there is some effort being going into addressing that with the career guide and the bibliography that i mentioned
POD1000000048_S0000212	but i am not really sure that there is you know any any specific set of pitfalls that i would recommend
POD1000000048_S0000213	people avoid besides not you know neglecting the areas in which they are weak and do not do not try and rest on your laurels in say technical areas or policy areas because it is a fairly interdisciplinary area
POD1000000048_S0000214	and you would need to think about you know what what sorts of disciplinary perspectives would be beneficial to solving the problem you are interested in and not just what is your background though of course you want to draw on your strengths
POD1000000048_S0000215	i guess because it is it is a field that is a fairly early stages and and is growing quickly
POD1000000048_S0000216	it would be a good fit for someone who was you know really able to set their own direction and and meet people and potentially attract funding to do what they want to do someone who is you know going to create the opportunities that they want to go into
POD1000000048_S0000217	yeah absolutely and yeah it is it is an area that is evolving and i think a lot a lot of the organizations
POD1000000048_S0000218	that exist today and i have mentioned as as good good places to work and so forth did not exist 5 years ago so
POD1000000048_S0000220	yeah some of them did not exist one year ago so it is it is an area in flux and i think as with politics
POD1000000048_S0000221	should be opportunistic about you know thinking about what what sorts of you know what is the right place for you to be in
POD1000000048_S0000222	but yeah i think it is it is a very exciting area to work in and i think that a lot of people will find that you know it is an area that would benefit from their their background
POD1000000048_S0000223	so if you had someone who could go into any kind of organizational role and they would be a good fit for it what kind of person would you think is most valuable out of everything
POD1000000048_S0000225	most valuable person i do not really have an answer for that
POD1000000048_S0000226	have an answer to that
POD1000000048_S0000227	
POD1000000048_S0000228	is there any is there any say vacancy out there that you think you know you just wish that someone someone could fill it
POD1000000048_S0000229	
POD1000000048_S0000231	i mean 11 vacancy that that comes to mind is for the policy researcher position at deepmind so they are currently hiring for for someone to specifically look at ai policy
POD1000000048_S0000232	so i think you know the the case is pretty clear that that would be a good place to work and a good role to have if you are interested in influencing the conversation around ai policy and being exposed to the latest development
POD1000000048_S0000233	so yeah if you are if you would be a good candidate for that then and you are interested in that you should definitely apply
POD1000000048_S0000234	so so sometimes i find people who want to work on ai policy because they do not see themselves as as quite cut out for for technical research perhaps because their their math skills are not are not quite good enough
POD1000000048_S0000235	is that a sensible way to go is in some ways the the strategy work harder just because it is it is it is less clear it is less precise than than technical work
POD1000000048_S0000236	i would not say it is harder or easier it is just different but even even on the technical side there is there is a lot of fuzziness
POD1000000048_S0000237	so ai safety was not very crisply defined a few years ago and it is starting to move more in the direction of technical rigor
POD1000000048_S0000238	and i think the same thing will happen to a policy to some extent but there will also always be some element of relationship building and and qualitative analysis and and so forth
POD1000000048_S0000239	that that that certainly is is you know not not exactly the same as as solving technical problems so yes i do think that having a different background would it would make sense to choose different areas to work based on your background
POD1000000048_S0000240	but i would not say that you know working on the safety problem is totally technical and the policy problem is totally non technical but certainly there is some correlation there
POD1000000048_S0000241	and what kind of level of technical understanding you have to get to in order to be able to make a useful contribution
POD1000000048_S0000242	i am not sure that you need any specific level in order to make some contribution so for example there there are a lot of roles that that can be played by people who are just you know good at distilling the literature on a particular topic
POD1000000048_S0000243	so for example if we are interested in understanding the role that ai could play in authoritarian state
POD1000000048_S0000244	then you do not necessarily have to have any technical background to read up on the literature around surveillance and coercion and and things like that
POD1000000048_S0000245	so i think there is a lot of room for just good synthesizers and and people who are curious and interested to dip into areas they are unfamiliar with
POD1000000048_S0000246	but i think there is also a fairly high ceiling for you know what would be used
POD1000000048_S0000247	i think it would also be good to have people with very strong technical backgrounds thinking about the you know the the nitty the nitty gritty game theory issues related to arms races and so forth
POD1000000048_S0000248	so i think you know it is a pretty it is pretty broad range of possible skillsets that would be useful
POD1000000048_S0000249	right you are thinking if you can just understand what you can speculate about what an ai might be capable of of doing in the future and then say if you know economics or if you know social science
POD1000000048_S0000250	you can think well what implications would that have for politics and that kind of thing even if you do not understand specifically how the how the ai would work
POD1000000048_S0000251	yeah i mean ideally you know a little bit about about each of those things but you do not need to be an expert in everything it is impossible to be an expert in every
POD1000000048_S0000252	so you it is not feasible to to learn about every every single discipline of which i will list several in this policy career guide that that you mentioned
POD1000000048_S0000253	and you know clearly you cannot be an expert you know a deep expert in technical ai economics sociology political science etc
POD1000000048_S0000254	but knowing a little bit and and being able to collaborate with people with complimentary skillsets is also very valuable
POD1000000048_S0000255	so i think a lot of the the most exciting work in the next few years will involve collaboration between people on the technical side and on the policy side
POD1000000048_S0000256	right so so how can someone tell which which kind of part they are they are most suited for
POD1000000048_S0000258	i do not think that there is any clear algorithm for this but talking to people in the area and and you know reading some of the literature and thinking about where where you think the gaps are
POD1000000048_S0000259	what what areas you think that you could shed light on given your background is definitely something you should do
POD1000000048_S0000260	you should look at what sorts of job opportunities are available and cast a fairly broad net because you do not necessarily know what what is going to strike your interest until you stumble upon that opportunity
POD1000000048_S0000261	and networking is also super helpful so i think not just in terms of finding out about job job opportunities and figuring out where there is a nice fit but also finding out about different organizational cultures and where you might fit in is also useful
POD1000000048_S0000262	so yeah i do not think there is a single algorithm but networking and reading more of the literature are and looking at job job postings are all good things to do
POD1000000048_S0000263	yeah what kinds of places can people network there are there any events that are open to people who do not yet have roles
POD1000000048_S0000264	yeah so all of the ai conferences are open to anyone who is capable of you know me you know paying paying for the trip and the the ticket
POD1000000048_S0000265	so so some examples of of big conferences are nips ism
POD1000000048_S0000267	triple ai and so forth
POD1000000048_S0000268	you know nips is you know the probably the biggest you know machine learning conference right now with an emphasis on deep learning is also a very large one actually i am not sure which one of those is bigger
POD1000000048_S0000269	i have not been to is but i have been nips a few times and clear is also a deep learning specific conference
POD1000000048_S0000270	i think going to conferences like that and specifically going to workshops and symposia that are relevant to policy questions which often happens at these conferences
POD1000000048_S0000271	so for example at nips last year there was there is a symposium on ai and the law so there
POD1000000048_S0000272	there are opportunities like that to network and to find find out more about how people in that area are thinking and to to meet people who have similar interests
POD1000000048_S0000273	and you know that is just on the ai side there is also it is also worth thinking about more policy oriented conferences so there is some conferences like the governance of emerging technologies conference
POD1000000048_S0000274	the robot conference series and probably a few others that would be of interest to people who are either on the technical side want to move into more thinking about policy side
POD1000000048_S0000275	or just they are on the policy side but they want to specifically seek out people interested in ai those would be good places to look
POD1000000048_S0000276	and are any of the organizations involved open enough that someone who is interested in the area can can drop by and get to know people
POD1000000048_S0000277	yeah so i think particularly on the academic side though to some extent also at corporations there is a fair amount of openness
POD1000000048_S0000278	and you know for example at fhi we host a lot of visitors who just want to learn more about our work and the same is true of other organizations
POD1000000048_S0000280	yeah so it sounded like in your guide you thought that the best undergraduate major was was something like combining a technical subject
POD1000000048_S0000281	like maths or computer science with more social science topics like you know politics or economics
POD1000000048_S0000282	assuming that most people listening to this have already chosen chosen their major what should people do at the post graduate level should should they do a ph d or just go and work directly at google if they can
POD1000000048_S0000284	
POD1000000048_S0000286	i mean i have probably said this a 10 times but i do not think there is a clear answer for everyone but
POD1000000048_S0000288	but certainly you know it does not hurt to have an advanced degree of course there are opportunity costs but they are there is certainly more job opportunities available for someone who you know has a ph d
POD1000000048_S0000289	so for example i do not know if it is a hard requirement certainly but certainly it would be a benefit for people applying to a fair number of industry jobs if they had an advanced degree
POD1000000048_S0000290	as well as in academia i mean it is hard to avoid the fact that you know for academic jobs as much as we would like to hire people solely based on you know their demonstrated skills
POD1000000048_S0000291	often also the case that there are university policies surrounding what sorts of degrees you need for for different roles and pay grades and so forth so
POD1000000048_S0000292	there is definitely value to having a graduate degree despite the you know non trivial opportunity costs if you have an opportunity
POD1000000048_S0000293	but as with all of these things it depends on someone is background and if you have a clear opportunity to make an impact
POD1000000048_S0000294	and you could perhaps get some of the best of both worlds by also taking classes online or enrolling at a local university and being a part time phd student or a master is student
POD1000000048_S0000295	you know you should there might be ways to have your cake and eat it too but it would depend on the particular person
POD1000000048_S0000296	yeah and and i guess the most obvious options at the post graduate level are things like machine learning or computer science or economics or i guess public policy is is that useful
POD1000000048_S0000297	yeah so at you know just to give a particular example at oxford we have a handful of people who are interested in ai safety and ai policy as well as broader issues related to the future
POD1000000048_S0000298	and you know just at the organization that i am at there are people who are either currently enrolled or will soon be enrolled in programs in mine which is human and social dimensions of science and technology
POD1000000048_S0000299	as well as machine learning cyber security and zoology so there there is a wide range of possible areas that one could study and find an advisor that is suitable and interested in supporting interesting work
POD1000000048_S0000301	yeah so so some people worry that that doing work in this in this area could could be harmful if if not done well for example it could be that as you were saying earlier that regulation in this area could could be done poorly and would actually be harmful overall
POD1000000048_S0000302	or that bringing greater attention to the issue could could reinforce the arms race dynamic or alternatively having people get involved who do not have enough technical expertise could could bring the area into disrepute
POD1000000048_S0000303	how seriously do you take those kinds of concerns should should people be cautious about about jumping into the area if if they do not feel like they are really on top of things
POD1000000048_S0000304	i
POD1000000048_S0000306	think that it is a reasonable concern and you know there there is
POD1000000048_S0000307	some some risk of discrediting yourself or your cause by by being you know to to alarmist or whatever the the particular charge might be
POD1000000048_S0000308	but on the other hand there is a lot of noise in this system no matter what and you know whatever you whatever you do in the near term there will be terminator pictures and and people who dismiss ai safety and all sorts of other things you can not really control
POD1000000048_S0000309	i think there are also risks of not acting which is you know not you know not being able to help out when you know there is an important problem and and you have something to contribute
POD1000000048_S0000310	i would say if if that is something that concerns you then talk to people about you know your beliefs and what their beliefs are and you know
POD1000000048_S0000311	whether there is you know how and look at surveys of experts and you know see see how you know what what what the you know reasonable distribution is among people who have studied the topic more
POD1000000048_S0000312	so i do not think it is you know an all or nothing sort of thing where you either have to stay ignorant or you know be a super expert
POD1000000048_S0000313	i think there is there is a middle ground where you sort of you know develop your confidence little by little as you go and try and remain as modest as possible in areas that you have little expertise
POD1000000048_S0000314	yeah and i suppose you can always just track the things that people like you nick bostrom are saying and how you speak about the issue so that so that you do not come across as as alarmist and you know you have a measured and precise tone
POD1000000048_S0000315	right right
POD1000000048_S0000316	yeah so so you mentioned earlier that that ai could potentially be used in military applications and that is one way that things could go badly given that do you see much value in people going into into military or intelligence roles to with the hope of limiting this in the future
POD1000000048_S0000318	possibly it is really hard to say it would depend on the particular role so probably a role higher up in the chain and more on the policy and strategy side of things
POD1000000048_S0000319	as opposed to the more operational or logistical or execution side of things would be more likely to give you an opportunity to to affect those sorts of things
POD1000000048_S0000320	but there might also be benefits to that beyond just having a direct impact on the issue while in that role
POD1000000048_S0000321	you can also develop valuable connections and know the right people to influence from the outside down the road or have a better understanding of the dynamics of the problem and what needs to be done to solve it so
POD1000000048_S0000322	i definitely would not dismiss it but i also would not necessarily recommend it across the board as as the best thing to do
POD1000000048_S0000323	yeah i guess the intelligence services and the military are just such enormous bureaucracies i suppose i worry that someone like it is just unlikely perhaps that you would be in the right place at the right time or have enough discretion in those roles to be able to make a difference
POD1000000048_S0000324	but as you say it could it could help you to build up your career capital so you can get other other useful role in future and you know how the system works so you can potentially influence it from outside and talk to the right people
POD1000000048_S0000325	yeah exactly so you know again it would depend on the particular person and what other options they have but it is certainly worth considering
POD1000000048_S0000326	what about what about foreign policy could it be useful to go into you know the department department of state or something like that and work on arms control agreements
POD1000000048_S0000327	even just current arms control agreements so that you you understand how they work and can think about how they might work for ai in future
POD1000000048_S0000329	yeah so i think that could be very useful looking at arms control and foreign policy both from an academic perspective and from a practitioner perspective i think is very valuable
POD1000000048_S0000330	it is something that we are not that is not our strong suit in the ai safety and policy community right now
POD1000000048_S0000331	so you know more could be done on that front but i think you know some of the same caveats apply to the the as to the military and intelligence side of things that that the state department for example is a very large bureaucracy
POD1000000048_S0000332	yeah and how do you feel about just more general attempts to to make the world better such that when ai is developed things are more likely to go
POD1000000048_S0000333	example just improving the quality of government in general trying to you know get get the right kinds of people elected or or improving our ability to forecast the future across the board
POD1000000048_S0000335	is i guess one worry would be that that is just not sufficiently leveraged on this specific problem and if you think ai is is really likely to be the key issue then you want to work on that specifically
POD1000000048_S0000336	but but maybe if you can improve our ability to forecast technological changes in future across the board then that that could be a better option and and also you know you just have a lot more options if you are if you are open to broader ways of improving the world
POD1000000048_S0000337	yeah i do not think there is a clear decision for everyone but both at the you know group level and at the individual level it often makes sense to take somewhat of a portfolio approach
POD1000000048_S0000338	so you know there are people at who also affiliated with the center for effective altruism and involved in building the community like on cotton barrett and toby ord
POD1000000048_S0000339	so there are people who straddle that boundary and and you know look for opportunities to benefit both sides and there are also people on you know who focus on one thing or the other
POD1000000048_S0000340	i do not think there is a clear right answer but certainly the the sorts of tradeoffs you mention sound reasonable like on the one hand one would want the world to be in a better place
POD1000000048_S0000341	there to be more people who are thinking carefully about making making good decisions and benefiting the future people in various important decision making roles
POD1000000048_S0000342	but there it is quite uncertain you know what what impact you could have on ai and likewise even even if you work directly on ai it is not totally clear that that is always the best thing you should do
POD1000000048_S0000343	but i have a slight you know bias towards thinking that that direct work is is you know needs more attention at the moment but i think you know that you should take that with a grain of salt
POD1000000048_S0000344	because i would like more people to help solve the specific problems i am working on
POD1000000048_S0000345	so we should potentially continue trying to get people involved should just become ai researchers right away
POD1000000048_S0000346	right
POD1000000048_S0000347	so that is that is all of my questions was there anything you wanted to add
POD1000000048_S0000348	any inspiring message
POD1000000048_S0000349	yeah i mean i will just sort of circle back on what i was saying earlier which is that ai safety was in a very nebulous stage of development a few years ago
POD1000000048_S0000350	and it took the work of nick bostrom and super intelligence and stuart russell and giving a lot of talks and writing op eds to call more attention to it and give it more legitimacy
POD1000000048_S0000351	and then subsequent work was done to refine the issue and develop research agendas by by people including the authors of the concrete problems in ai safety paper
POD1000000048_S0000352	and now we have a lot of postdocs and graduate students working specifically on this we have people in industry specifically working on well defined problems in this space
POD1000000048_S0000353	and we have the opportunity to make a similar transition in ai policy over the next few years
POD1000000048_S0000354	where we move from fairly high level desiderata and and problem framings to specific proposals and you know formal models and you know good white paper
POD1000000048_S0000355	and so forth over the next few years and it is it is an area that would benefit from a lot of people is expertise so i would definitely encourage people to who think they might have some relevant expertise to seriously consider
POD1000000048_S0000356	yeah i will just reiterate that since since wrote our problem profile on positively shaping artificial development we have heard from a lot of people who think that this is the the most neglected area within within ai safety
POD1000000048_S0000357	and very keen to get more people working on these problems and and getting more organizations hiring for them so if it is somthing that our interested in
POD1000000048_S0000358	think you should you should definitely be looking into it more and we will put up links to to guide where you can find out more and and meet the right people
POD1000000048_S0000360	yeah thanks so much have a great day and look forward to talking in future
POD1000000048_S0000361	thanks right
YOU1000000000_S0000000	on this week is episode we drive the new ford ranger we answer questions about evs and driving in cold weather
YOU1000000000_S0000001	and also answer the question what do we do with the cars once we are done testing them next on talking cars
YOU1000000000_S0000003	hi and welcome back i am mike quincy
YOU1000000000_S0000005	we would like to give a little behind the scenes look at what goes on here at consumer reports auto test track
YOU1000000000_S0000006	we talked to people who are diehard enthusiasts as well as people that look upon cars as merely appliances
YOU1000000000_S0000007	and we find that they are absolutely shocked when they find out that we buy every test car
YOU1000000000_S0000008	that we put through our test program and that for testing purposes we drive a different car every night
YOU1000000000_S0000009	so to take us through the process ryan how do you decide what do you drive every night
YOU1000000000_S0000010	well before that you know routine we buy we buy all these cars anonymously
YOU1000000000_S0000011	we bring them back here we check them in we have a wall of keys and it is like fantasy land right
YOU1000000000_S0000012	and we get to pick these cars every night almost every single night we drive a different car that is pretty ridiculous right
YOU1000000000_S0000013	so there is the wall of keys we pick what we are going to drive
YOU1000000000_S0000014	and some of these cars you know it is a brand new car has a priority we have to get it up to miles to get up to 2000 miles before we can test it
YOU1000000000_S0000015	and there is people that are writing 1st drives or the engineers that people that have a direct influence on you know the early testing
YOU1000000000_S0000016	have to get in these cars you know 1st
YOU1000000000_S0000017	video producers that get on us for doing a 1st drive video
YOU1000000000_S0000018	always bothering to do more
YOU1000000000_S0000019	so you know there is there is some some sort of i do not want a pecking order
YOU1000000000_S0000020	you know there is there is priorities people need to get the cars and we all understand that
YOU1000000000_S0000021	you know make way for that so once they are done once they are done testing them
YOU1000000000_S0000022	they go to another wall and that wall that is the huge wall yeah this wall is all like the retirees
YOU1000000000_S0000024	like we are all this is this is where it is interesting because this is where it is interesting
YOU1000000000_S0000025	the 1st keyboard is cars that they have to all get miles were driving them regardless right when they move to the other board now it is it is it is selective
YOU1000000000_S0000026	and that is when you get to see the favorites
YOU1000000000_S0000027	yeah you get to see the cars that people really actually like the cars that you know after testing people like
YOU1000000000_S0000028	i am not going to drive that anymore
YOU1000000000_S0000029	yeah it is so it is kind of interesting because some you know some of these cars like it is winter auto start
YOU1000000000_S0000030	heated seats they are clear winners so i mean i go up to vermont and do stuff i always have an suv
YOU1000000000_S0000031	something with all wheel drive
YOU1000000000_S0000032	you know you are into boats you got trailers to to do that stuff
YOU1000000000_S0000033	that brings us around to the to the springtime which we are hoping for that it comes anytime soon
YOU1000000000_S0000034	but but the most frequently asked question that i know i get asked probably you guys too
YOU1000000000_S0000035	is what do you do with the cars once you are done testing them right
YOU1000000000_S0000036	so you know we we sell the cars when we are done so the 1st thing we do is a company wide email goes out
YOU1000000000_S0000037	to let all the employees know you know what cars were currently selling what the what the selling price how many miles are on them
YOU1000000000_S0000038	and the cars that are not sold to employees then they typically go to auction
YOU1000000000_S0000039	we sell them there and then we take that money to buy more test cars and usually these cars have anywhere from 6 to 12000 miles on them when we are done testing
YOU1000000000_S0000040	some have more we keep some longer than others like let us say it has maybe some advanced safety features that we want to do more testing with
YOU1000000000_S0000041	or maybe there is a direct competitor of this car coming soon we want to keep this current car in our test fleet
YOU1000000000_S0000042	so that we have some really good back to back comparisons
YOU1000000000_S0000043	and so considering what we have on hand right now so like what what what is kind of got car that you find yourself signing out
YOU1000000000_S0000044	i actually have a few go to cars i mean one of them is the honda alaster turbo now
YOU1000000000_S0000045	the only one we have the manual
YOU1000000000_S0000046	only car we currently have with manual transmission you know it is it is it has really great handling really nice 6 speed manual shifter
YOU1000000000_S0000047	i actually do not go to it quite as much right now because it is you know quite cold it has summer tires summer tires do not work as well in the winter
YOU1000000000_S0000048	you know when it is a warmish day i will take it and it just kind of goes to show how important a manual transmission
YOU1000000000_S0000049	because i actually do not even really love that car you know it is rides pretty stiff
YOU1000000000_S0000050	and it is not like it has tons of power and its front wheel drive i am not a fan of front wheel drive performance cars you know
YOU1000000000_S0000051	but it shows how much i love driving manual transmission i will drive that car any chance i get
YOU1000000000_S0000052	but other cars that i go to genesis 70 it is like a nicer kasinger you know i love
YOU1000000000_S0000053	car 5 i mean it is it is a fantastic it is just great in every way smooth comfortable nice power train
YOU1000000000_S0000054	it does not get cold
YOU1000000000_S0000055	yeah it is that will be the keys are never available and then the ram 1500 because that is it is my favorite pickup truck i love pickup trucks
YOU1000000000_S0000056	it is so capable yet drives almost like a almost like a car and it has a great sounding
YOU1000000000_S0000057	those are those are my go tos
YOU1000000000_S0000058	ryan when you can choose what you yeah i mean
YOU1000000000_S0000059	it is like i said earlier it is winter i have been going north a bunch i use the 5
YOU1000000000_S0000060	i like the silverado you know like you mentioned the later like
YOU1000000000_S0000061	i do not fit in it that well it is fun to drive but there is just times when i am like it is just frustrating cause i do not fit in it that well
YOU1000000000_S0000062	i find myself as i mentioned before i go through fatigue
YOU1000000000_S0000063	i just sometimes get tired of it i miss cars yeah and i find myself signing out the nissan altima
YOU1000000000_S0000064	over and over it has got heated seats it has got a decent ride it has android auto so i have got i have got i have got a map
YOU1000000000_S0000065	i have got my music it is just an easy car to live with i mean it definitely has its faults as we found in our testing
YOU1000000000_S0000066	but i just i just i am comfortable in that car i do not know i do not know what else how else to put
YOU1000000000_S0000067	no one is fighting you for the key
YOU1000000000_S0000068	no one is fighting me through the keys
YOU1000000000_S0000069	so but again but like you guys i mean i am i am gravitating toward pickup trucks all the time you know these are test vehicles
YOU1000000000_S0000070	we we take them to home depot we go to the garden centers we use them to work all the time
YOU1000000000_S0000071	and i also am with you on the ram and the silver auto both great trucks
YOU1000000000_S0000072	which kind of brings us to our next topic of what we are driving this week at the track
YOU1000000000_S0000073	and so since clearly pickup trucks are big these days we have our new 2019 ford ranger
YOU1000000000_S0000074	this was hotly anticipated by those of us that that love pickup so mike if you could give us a you know quick rundown of of the ranger and how it got here
YOU1000000000_S0000075	yeah so the ranger was 1st sold in the u s in 1982 and was sold here until the 2011 model year
YOU1000000000_S0000076	and sales were strong you know for for a while when that pickup was 1st 1st came out but like in the mid 2000 sales started going down
YOU1000000000_S0000077	pretty dramatically and so you know that was a joint project the ranger between mazda they had the b series pickup
YOU1000000000_S0000078	was basically you know almost identical to the ranger
YOU1000000000_S0000079	so ford has looked at it and was like you know well you know is it worth with sales going down so much is it worth you know investing the money
YOU1000000000_S0000080	you know totally redesign the truck because by 2011 that thing was really old it was an aging truck yeah
YOU1000000000_S0000081	and so they decided to you know to to not you know have the truck here anymore
YOU1000000000_S0000082	and then you know the market was basically this compact or mid size pickup segment was you know largely dominated by the tota tacoma has been for a long time
YOU1000000000_S0000083	but the nissan frontier kept in there but those you know the tacoma especially is quite an old design as well
YOU1000000000_S0000084	then chevy with the colorado and gmc with the twin the canyon
YOU1000000000_S0000085	you know redesign their pickups and i think ford looked at it like okay hold it we still we have a ranger that is sold in other markets
YOU1000000000_S0000086	this and you know the ridge line was redesigned came back was redesigned gladiators coming out
YOU1000000000_S0000087	i think they said we got to get back in this market because pickups are still hot in this country
YOU1000000000_S0000088	and so they they have this existing design sold elsewhere
YOU1000000000_S0000089	they brought it back here and that is where we are now with this 2019 ford ranger
YOU1000000000_S0000090	not everyone needs you know 1500 half ton pickup truck i mean
YOU1000000000_S0000091	i mean i mean i need a 3500 duly diesel that is just me that is just me you need a step ladder to get up
YOU1000000000_S0000092	another short joke they are running board this is what this this i have a hard time with this segment because this truck the ranger we had was about $40000
YOU1000000000_S0000094	you can get a full sized truck for a little more money right and i personally i think it is crazy because i do not fit in these trucks as well
YOU1000000000_S0000095	and they are it is it is half it is half the truck i mean it does not make sense to me for that kind of money if you are if you are space space conscience you want a smaller vehicle it makes some sense but beyond that
YOU1000000000_S0000096	and i posted on consumer reports facebook page a picture of of the new ranger
YOU1000000000_S0000097	spend 40000 +and almost every comment was $40000
YOU1000000000_S0000098	it is a lot of money
YOU1000000000_S0000099	you know we we try to outfit the trucks a certain way you know all cars we try to outwit the way we think most people are going to right the way the truck is going to be sold so that is why right now that truck 40000
YOU1000000000_S0000101	current full size trucks right now ending up at about 50000 so for 10000 more you are going to have a really nice full size truck not ripe
YOU1000000000_S0000102	that is what i mean you could yeah no yeah but anyway either way i drove it yeah i was going to say how does it do i drove it last night and i was pleased actually
YOU1000000000_S0000103	because i went into like the coma i do not care for the tacoma the tacoma is great but it does not i do not fit in well
YOU1000000000_S0000104	it does not excite me when i drive it i am just the colorado is the same thing i fit in that better this thing i actually fit in it quite well the seating positions nice i can see
YOU1000000000_S0000105	my grips the power train it has got a 4 cylinder ecoboost
YOU1000000000_S0000107	yeah and it is has plenty of power but it is not smooth there is there is some sort of a driveline vibration i feel i am not going to harp on that too much because it might be this thing needs to break in a little more on for 1000 miles
YOU1000000000_S0000108	400 to 40 did not drive
YOU1000000000_S0000109	broke our record from home
YOU1000000000_S0000110	it is only got 400 miles on it roughly and things are going to break keep you know settling and break
YOU1000000000_S0000111	we have noticed that things like transmissions change over our breaking period sometimes quite often get smoother during the
YOU1000000000_S0000112	and you know the transmission there was a couple goofy shifts and you know these things yeah these things get ironed out but i mean
YOU1000000000_S0000113	it has got it has got plenty of power was i was happy with that the tacoma feels underpowered to me even the colorado feels underpowered to me
YOU1000000000_S0000114	this thing on the highway i noticed quite a bit of wind noise from the the door seals and the you know just the yeah the seals i guess
YOU1000000000_S0000116	other than that
YOU1000000000_S0000117	i am with you in a lot of ways i was actually really looking forward to this truck so in some ways i was a little more let down
YOU1000000000_S0000118	i really think we need a really good cops came you are right i think we the market needs a really good compact pickup
YOU1000000000_S0000119	it looks the part no question about it and it is a real truck unlike the honda ridge line which is really just a glorified you know with a car yeah it is basically a car
YOU1000000000_S0000120	this is a real truck the biggest gripe for me is the ride it has one of the stiffest bounties rides i think of any pickup on the market right now
YOU1000000000_S0000121	think it is worse than the tacoma
YOU1000000000_S0000122	i am not saying it is worse i am saying
YOU1000000000_S0000123	i think write better than the coma
YOU1000000000_S0000124	i think interest
YOU1000000000_S0000125	i am with ryan on this actually it is not a smooth rock
YOU1000000000_S0000127	if you if you you know if you are a pickup person you are going to put up with i had it for a weekend and i put a lot of miles on it
YOU1000000000_S0000128	and i was fine with it but it is definitely noticeably bouncy tougher road truck no question about it
YOU1000000000_S0000129	so i think that is probably my biggest gripe is that it is you know if you someone who buys a ridgeline this is it is completely different completely
YOU1000000000_S0000130	even compare those 2
YOU1000000000_S0000131	people do that is the problem and we do i mean we we compare we have
YOU1000000000_S0000132	fan of the ridge line it drives it drives really nicely but the
YOU1000000000_S0000133	the pilot i mean course it rides well but
YOU1000000000_S0000134	you know i agree with you on on the drive train though it to me it sounds wheezy
YOU1000000000_S0000135	it is it sounds wheezy yet it has got good power it is really weird and then also keep in mind it has a 10 speed automatic transmission
YOU1000000000_S0000136	pretty impressive you know and and and i found in general it shifts pretty smoothly it is still breaking in
YOU1000000000_S0000137	there was a couple times where i would you know be exiting a low speed turn and was you know little delay on figuring out which gear i wanted to be in
YOU1000000000_S0000138	you know like i was other than that i think it is a little silly i do not like the 5 foot bed
YOU1000000000_S0000139	it is you can not get if you want the 4 door crew cab like what we have you can only get the 5 foot
YOU1000000000_S0000140	the way the ranger works is if you get the smaller you know extra or whatever yeah you can you get the 6 foot bed
YOU1000000000_S0000141	if you get the 4 crew cab it is only the 5 foot bed so you do not have those are your choices there is no bed choices
YOU1000000000_S0000142	whereas say the sheer like colorado you can get the longer bed with the with the bigger cab
YOU1000000000_S0000143	and the other thing like just like the running boards are just placed awkwardly there is no grab handle to get in you know on a pickup that sits that high
YOU1000000000_S0000144	grab and it is kind of tall notice
YOU1000000000_S0000145	just one more thing on handling i thought was interesting is this thing feels like a miniature 150
YOU1000000000_S0000146	got this that dull slow kind of steering kind of just dead feels like
YOU1000000000_S0000147	115 bad yeah and yeah and when you turn it actually has a body roll like it kind of gives a little
YOU1000000000_S0000148	and that is kind of that truck feel i do not think it is the end of the world but it it was interesting to me that it reacted kind of like that because colorado is nothing like silverado
YOU1000000000_S0000149	my eyes but
YOU1000000000_S0000150	you know keep keep checking back consumer
YOU1000000000_S0000151	fresh yeah this is just our early impressions
YOU1000000000_S0000152	going to have more information pretty soon we are going to have a 1st drive and video which takes us to our next section of questions
YOU1000000000_S0000153	please send us your video and text questions to talking cars at icloud dot com
YOU1000000000_S0000154	1st up is a video question about the toyoda 4 hybrid and let us take a listen
YOU1000000000_S0000155	hello team i and my husband are expecting baby in june and we are in the market to buy our 1st car in next month or so
YOU1000000000_S0000156	i have a question about about 2019 for hybrid all wheel drive system
YOU1000000000_S0000157	i have learned that the rear is disconnected from the front and the rear wheels get power from the auxiliary battery which get charged when brakes are applied
YOU1000000000_S0000158	does this mean that on a snowy highway when we need all of all wheel drive constantly
YOU1000000000_S0000159	when we are driving this car at a steady pace without using too much brakes then i am turning into risk of depleting the battery
YOU1000000000_S0000160	and soon the car turning into just front field drive what is the probability of battery getting discharged completely considering we have a lot of snow in northeast canada
YOU1000000000_S0000161	sometimes we may need all wheel drive for prolonged period of 6 to 7 hours and if it is a big problem then should we disregard or hybrid
YOU1000000000_S0000162	and look for alternate hybrid like rogue hybrid
YOU1000000000_S0000163	wow what a great question and clearly shows that talking cars listeners and viewers are very very smart and highly educated
YOU1000000000_S0000164	knows what she is talking about here yeah so the the new rap for hybrid is actually going to have the same hybrid system that they they have been using this hybrid system since the 1st highlander hybrid
YOU1000000000_S0000165	and i remember this distinctly because i can remember being in a snowstorm watching a highlander hybrid brand new car stuck in front wheel drive looked like it was front wheel drive trying to climb a hill
YOU1000000000_S0000166	and this is because this car has a gasoline engine and its front it is technically a front heel drive car and the hybrid system is a completely separate unit in the rear
YOU1000000000_S0000167	batteries electric motors separately controlled at the rear now
YOU1000000000_S0000168	and in theory they they say this thing you know when you take off it is going to give you power you know
YOU1000000000_S0000169	at the rear wheels if it sends a slip and it can help you go over time though you can drain that battery down
YOU1000000000_S0000170	you are left with a potentially front wheel drive
YOU1000000000_S0000171	i mean just to do a little contrast as opposed to traditional
YOU1000000000_S0000172	all wheel drive 4 wheel drive it does not have a big drive sharing yeah i would have a drive shaft on the right where you can lock everything
YOU1000000000_S0000173	exactly and it is it is neat it is a neat idea but i mean i have seen this thing struggle
YOU1000000000_S0000174	this is they are using the same technology the brand new 2019 rap 4 is going to have the same system
YOU1000000000_S0000175	so for her if she is really weighing heavily on having all wheel drive i would not use this as a you know a substitute for that
YOU1000000000_S0000176	at the same time you you do not you do not you do not need all wheel drive all the time even in the snow
YOU1000000000_S0000177	if if you know it sounds like she is mostly concerned about being you know highway drives in snow
YOU1000000000_S0000178	well you know hopefully she has 4 snow stars because that is actually the most important thing is if she drives a lot of snow
YOU1000000000_S0000179	she should have 4 notes and then even if it was only front wheel drive shed in most cases still be fine and keep in mind this system was designed to be in front drive
YOU1000000000_S0000180	as much as possible for efficiency efficiency right so therefore it is only going for the most part it is only going to switch to to all wheel drive
YOU1000000000_S0000181	when it like you said it is senses slip so a lot of the time even in snow she is going to be driving down the highway
YOU1000000000_S0000182	it is going to want to be in front will drive anyway until it senses that slip right so but but even then really the more important thing
YOU1000000000_S0000183	is snow tires right yeah absolutely i mean but unless she is you know she is might notice a problem on you know steep uphill
YOU1000000000_S0000184	on the highway or even more so on backroads is really where there is going to potentially be a problem
YOU1000000000_S0000185	that battery were if she were to be unlucky that the battery is drained when she is trying to go up a steep slippery
YOU1000000000_S0000186	having having a new kid and i mean maybe there would be nervous to tell her that this was a good idea right
YOU1000000000_S0000187	you could say well you know so she is thinking about another hybrid you know the nissan rogue hybrid
YOU1000000000_S0000188	but the problem is a lot of these hybrids they are going to work you know they become yeah they become all wheel drive in the same similar way similar way
YOU1000000000_S0000189	maybe a hybrid is all wheel drive is not her best choice correct
YOU1000000000_S0000190	alternative that we talked about is is you know on consumer reports top rated vehicles the the subaru forester
YOU1000000000_S0000191	which you do not have to worry about the all wheel drive system right kind of you know saying bye bye
YOU1000000000_S0000192	and you you are using a lot
YOU1000000000_S0000193	not going to be as efficient but it is still quite efficient
YOU1000000000_S0000195	efficiency or do you want the safety of being stuck
YOU1000000000_S0000196	now she has no more worries about you know about the drive system not being there when she needs it anyway
YOU1000000000_S0000197	thanks for your question very astute you clearly know your cars and now we are going to move on to the next one which is getting used and winter driving
YOU1000000000_S0000198	the question reads i live in new hampshire i am looking to get an car i am looking at a used b 3
YOU1000000000_S0000199	use tesla models or a new model 3 all real drive
YOU1000000000_S0000200	how does an rear wheel drive handle in the snow with snow tires of course thank you for teaching me about snow tires
YOU1000000000_S0000201	i normally think best to worst all wheel drive front wheel drive
YOU1000000000_S0000202	and rear wheel drive with internal combustion engine cars where would a rear wheel drive fit into that lineup
YOU1000000000_S0000203	so ryan tieman tellis pros and cons
YOU1000000000_S0000204	this is this is an interesting question because
YOU1000000000_S0000206	an easy answer the 1st thing that comes to mind is he he says he lives in new hampshire
YOU1000000000_S0000207	it is cold there you know almost half the year in august my 1st my 1st reservation would be having an electric car in a cold climate
YOU1000000000_S0000208	because it would drive you nuts you lose a lot of range right batteries worst enemy is a cold right
YOU1000000000_S0000209	we did a story on this recently
YOU1000000000_S0000210	1st issue but going back to what he is saying 100% you have to have snow tires a rear wheel drive car is going to
YOU1000000000_S0000211	rear wheel drive electric car because you have electric motors they have regenerative braking
YOU1000000000_S0000212	my concern would be when you lift off the throttle you have to get used to this when you lift off the throttle it is going to be it is essentially dragging at the rear end you are creating a rear
YOU1000000000_S0000213	which is a weird feeling on a dry
YOU1000000000_S0000214	road right now if it is slippery surface excuse me they are going to they are going to be dragging if it is really slippery stability control the cars can be doing a lot of work
YOU1000000000_S0000215	now you are not going to spin out of control we have you know modern stability control is very good especially in these cars but
YOU1000000000_S0000216	is it going to go in the snow absolutely i think there is going to be some learning curve there like driving it smoothly and not dealing with all that you know the the stability control going crazy
YOU1000000000_S0000217	he is right i mean all wheel drive cars probably your best bet with with snow tires absolutely of course
YOU1000000000_S0000218	when it comes to front and rear world drive it is preference i mean i drove a w for years would sandbags and snow tires and i went anywhere i needed to go
YOU1000000000_S0000219	but i preferred that for the average driver maybe front he drives a little bit better with snow tires that is preference
YOU1000000000_S0000220	i think front wheel drive is easier to control for most drivers because you do not have to worry about power power on oversteer like you do with a real drive car real drive car is definitely more fun
YOU1000000000_S0000221	but what i do not like about front wheel drive cars is you are asking you know the the front wheels to do 2 things to both power the drive the car
YOU1000000000_S0000222	you know power the car forwards and also steer the car and that is what i like about
YOU1000000000_S0000223	you know real world drive cars but i think the bigger question is why does this person want you know is there a specific reason he is looking for real drive
YOU1000000000_S0000224	and if that is living in new hampshire if that is the case then then you know if you want the real drive because you find that more fun to drive then go for
YOU1000000000_S0000225	you know you know you could go with a little newer tesla
YOU1000000000_S0000226	and you know and get all wheel drive so that is another option
YOU1000000000_S0000227	but the the most and the interesting thing about these electric cars though is i looked up the weight distribution and it is actually not bad
YOU1000000000_S0000228	i mean so for instance the 3 is 55% of the weight is to the rear these this is you know our testing
YOU1000000000_S0000229	the models rear drive was 53% to the rear model 352%
YOU1000000000_S0000230	so this is what we we put our our scale so the point is there is some weight back there you know a lot of cars are you know a lot of real drive cars are more 5050
YOU1000000000_S0000231	so you have got a little bit more weight over the rear to give you some traction but the most important thing is with snow tires and abs
YOU1000000000_S0000232	traction control and electronic stability control you are going to be fine even with real drive
YOU1000000000_S0000233	right i was going to make the argument front wheel drive the weight is over the drive wheel
YOU1000000000_S0000234	slippery conditions that is usually gets complicated
YOU1000000000_S0000235	does get complicated because the weight transfer goes rearward
YOU1000000000_S0000236	thanks so much for your question kind of brings us to our final one unfortunately we have got to wrap this up the question reads
YOU1000000000_S0000237	love your show i drive 2018 accord el and love all the drivers systems
YOU1000000000_S0000238	i drove the car in light snow and after 10 minutes i got a message on the screen that the radar is obstructed
YOU1000000000_S0000239	meaning no driver assist which you are probably seeing on your screen right now what can one conclude from that about self driving cars in the winter
YOU1000000000_S0000241	exactly our concern right all of this technology and that is why self driving cars are not here yet yes
YOU1000000000_S0000242	one of the sensors sensors is a broad term there is there is all different types of sensors there is optical there is you know eyesight there is sonar there is all kinds of sensors
YOU1000000000_S0000243	if they are clogged up or there is something in the way they are not going to work well and if you are relying on that to save your life you are crazy right
YOU1000000000_S0000244	i just this is this is the the weak spot of this technology it is not perfect and he did not drive far and it was already not working right this is this is a major concern of ours
YOU1000000000_S0000245	yeah we did a story we recently did a story on consumer reports dot org called how to keep your car is safety sensors clean
YOU1000000000_S0000246	when snow and ice attack so the reality is that you know you know there is radar sensors on the front of a lot of new cars
YOU1000000000_S0000247	have you know forward collision warning automatic emergency braking usually in the grill quite often in the the emblem you know the emblems have gotten quite huge these days
YOU1000000000_S0000248	and so they have those radar sensors in there and so what can happen is snow ice salt can you know get all grimed up on there
YOU1000000000_S0000249	and so when that happens the system is going to shut down because it knows it can not see what it needs to see anymore
YOU1000000000_S0000250	and it will give you a warning on your your dashboard that this has happened but now you know for collision warning automatic emergency break are not going to work anymore so you can no longer rely
YOU1000000000_S0000251	little bit regional because you know we are if you are in the snow but this is going to be a bigger issue but still sand and dust and mud in the southern states eventually the same it is going to do the same thing sure to keep these things clean
YOU1000000000_S0000252	and you also need to you know and keep in mind there is sensors all around your cars these days you know you know for blind spot warning and things like that
YOU1000000000_S0000253	and your your rearview camera you know there is a little lens back there that you you know even in rain
YOU1000000000_S0000254	it will you know if you if you are you have been driving rain and you put you know the car in reverse it is very blurry back there because it is it is all has has you know water all over
YOU1000000000_S0000255	so it is important to keep these sensors clean if you are driving on you know a snowy trip or whatever and it gives you that warning
YOU1000000000_S0000256	you know pull over at the next rest area that you can and clean off the front grill
YOU1000000000_S0000257	and we actually did i believe we did a video on this with jen stockburger that is online right producer dave can people check that video out
YOU1000000000_S0000258	so check out that video because jen tells you she shows you where all the sensors are on the cars and how to clean
YOU1000000000_S0000259	but the more important thing is where they are and also your owner is manual will tell you where all those sensors are on your specific car and that is very important to know that
YOU1000000000_S0000260	when you get this warning that hey these things are not working right anymore well you need to know where they are so you can you can clean them
YOU1000000000_S0000261	that is going to do it for this episode if you want to learn more about the topics of the cars that we talked about check out the show notes and keep those questions coming talking cars at icloud dot com
YOU1000000000_S0000262	thanks so much for tuning in we will see you next week

YOU1000000002_S0000001	the wuhan coronavirus began like all new viruses with a remarkably ordinary moment
YOU1000000002_S0000002	in late november 2019 someone it is not yet known who ate a wild animal that by chance carried the novel coronavirus
YOU1000000002_S0000003	and days later started to feel the symptoms of what initially seemed like a bad cold
YOU1000000002_S0000004	from there more individuals were infected at 1st through the consumption of other wild animals but later through direct human to human transmission
YOU1000000002_S0000005	for the entire month of december the virus was there in wuhan spreading but nobody knew it
YOU1000000002_S0000006	the cases presenting as pneumonia were at 1st considered to be caused by any one of the countless other viruses that can create such symptoms
YOU1000000002_S0000007	but eventually the escalation in cases and the fact that almost all the 1st patients had bought food at one particular wild animal market caught the wuhan city government is attention
YOU1000000002_S0000008	the 1st official confirmation that something was up came on new year is eve
YOU1000000002_S0000009	december 31st when the municipal health commission published a press release acknowledging the situation
YOU1000000002_S0000010	over a month after the 1st transmission at the time this was small local news
YOU1000000002_S0000011	only a few dozen cases of pneumonia in a city of 10s in a country of a 10
YOU1000000002_S0000012	but then came the news that this was not one of the many pre existing pneumonia causing viruses
YOU1000000002_S0000013	this was something new western media 1st reported on the novel coronavirus around january 8th
YOU1000000002_S0000014	the new york times foreboding wrote there is no evidence that the new virus is readily spread by humans and it has not been tied to any deaths
YOU1000000002_S0000015	that would soon change
YOU1000000002_S0000016	on january 21st when the world health organization started tracking the outbreak there were 282 cases
YOU1000000002_S0000017	the next day 314 the next 581
YOU1000000002_S0000018	then 846 then 1320
YOU1000000002_S0000019	then 2014 and by the start of the week of january 26 it was clear that this would not be a quick and painless virus
YOU1000000002_S0000020	this would be one for the history books and it was going to get a lot worse before it got any better
YOU1000000002_S0000021	drastic circumstances called for drastic action it was clear given the trends that wuhan is hospitals would soon be overwhelmed by patients
YOU1000000002_S0000022	and in the case of highly infectious viruses like coronavirus that makes a bad situation worse as infected individuals will try to recover at home
YOU1000000002_S0000023	where the virus can more easily spread therefore the decision was made on january 23rd to build a brand new facility capable of treating 1000 patients at once
YOU1000000002_S0000024	shenshen hospital it was announced that this would be done fully constructed by february 2nd
YOU1000000002_S0000025	just 10 days later
YOU1000000002_S0000026	china has experience with such a feat in 2003 the country suffered an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome or sars which is also caused by a form of coronavirus
YOU1000000002_S0000027	much like with the novel coronavirus hospitals were overwhelmed and many had to turn away patients
YOU1000000002_S0000028	in response the government decided to build a new hospital
YOU1000000002_S0000029	over 6 days 7000 construction workers brought the changchun hospital into reality and it quickly began accepting patients and were leaving the overstressed medical system
YOU1000000002_S0000030	once the outbreak settled down the shotgun hospital was hailed as a massive success by both the country itself and the world health organization
YOU1000000002_S0000031	the statistics speak for themselves overall sars had a fatality rate of 9.6%
YOU1000000002_S0000032	at the sunshine hospital just one.2% of patients died
YOU1000000002_S0000033	and not a single staff member was infected
YOU1000000002_S0000034	it is no wonder why china wanted to replicate this
YOU1000000002_S0000035	therefore she tung shan was the model for the new coronavirus hospital but this time would be different
YOU1000000002_S0000036	the 2003 hospital began construction over 6 months after the beginning of the outbreak
YOU1000000002_S0000037	the 2020 hospitals started construction less than 2 months after the 1st case and just days after the seriousness of the outbreak became clear
YOU1000000002_S0000038	there was far less time for planning and design the orders came and then it was immediately time to start
YOU1000000002_S0000039	step one was finding a place to put the hospital
YOU1000000002_S0000040	the location selected was previously just an open field about 14 miles or 22 kilometers from central wuhan
YOU1000000002_S0000041	this kept it away from the dense urban core where further transmission might be easier but the field in question was also right off a large pre existing road which made access easy
YOU1000000002_S0000042	that road was quickly shut down and turned into essentially a parking lot and staging area for the project
YOU1000000002_S0000043	the contract for this project was given to china construction 3rd engineering bureau company a subsidiary of the state owned china state construction engineering corporation
YOU1000000002_S0000044	by revenue this is the world is largest construction company and it has experienced in enormous projects like beijing is new airport egypt is new capital city and tesla is shanghai gigafactory
YOU1000000002_S0000045	if anyone was going to pull this off it was them
YOU1000000002_S0000046	to begin construction in earnest they 1st needed to prepare the selected site
YOU1000000002_S0000047	that involved 1st cutting down all the trees and shrubbery and then perfectly leveling the ground
YOU1000000002_S0000048	out of the 10 day construction timeline this took longer than one might think
YOU1000000002_S0000049	about 48 hours
YOU1000000002_S0000050	this was due in part to the fact that the project was significantly understaffed in its 1st few days
YOU1000000002_S0000051	as they scramble to find workers especially as its start coincided with chinese new year is
YOU1000000002_S0000052	once the land was leveled though they moved on to constructing the building foundations by sunday january 26
YOU1000000002_S0000053	for this they used a layered system
YOU1000000002_S0000054	on the bottom an 8 inch or 20 centimeter layer of sand was placed then what is referred to as a geo textile layer
YOU1000000002_S0000055	a form of fabric then a layer of waterproof plastic then another geo textile layer then another layer of sand
YOU1000000002_S0000056	on that they then poured concrete which dried over a few days
YOU1000000002_S0000057	but then came the truly impressive element
YOU1000000002_S0000058	constructing the buildings themselves in a matter of days
YOU1000000002_S0000059	what made this possible was the use of prefabricated elements
YOU1000000002_S0000060	modular construction such as this has been on the rise recently
YOU1000000002_S0000061	it is now a well established technique for the construction of buildings large and small
YOU1000000002_S0000062	the idea is simply that somewhere off site a number of identical building elements are built
YOU1000000002_S0000063	then they are shipped to the construction site and put together
YOU1000000002_S0000064	this has plenty of advantages
YOU1000000002_S0000065	1st and foremost the use of identical elements built in a factory system to construct a larger building lowers costs through economies of scale
YOU1000000002_S0000066	then when you actually get to putting the building together onsite construction time is significantly less
YOU1000000002_S0000067	which once again lower cost
YOU1000000002_S0000068	in this case though cost was not the primary concern
YOU1000000002_S0000069	speed was and modular construction is the fastest way to build
YOU1000000002_S0000070	most of the site used a type of prefabricated modular construction common with temporary buildings
YOU1000000002_S0000071	while it is not clear which company produced the prefabricated components it is clear that they existed before the project started
YOU1000000002_S0000072	the 1st building elements started coming together on monday january 27th just 4 days after the project broke ground
YOU1000000002_S0000073	they began by building the skeleton of the modular units
YOU1000000002_S0000074	each of these units was about the shape and size of a 20 foot shipping container
YOU1000000002_S0000075	and this skeleton form included just the floor ceiling and structural supports at each corner
YOU1000000002_S0000076	throughout this all separate teams out of the 1000s of workers there started to hook the site up to utilities like sewage water electricity and internet
YOU1000000002_S0000077	much of this just involved bringing in the state owned companies responsible for these but for internet and the subsequent building out of an it system private companies like awe and lenovo got involved
YOU1000000002_S0000078	this was no doubt partially because the construction of this hospital drew considerable public attention in china
YOU1000000002_S0000079	it came to represent the physical manifestation of the country is response to the crisis and also of china is engineering might
YOU1000000002_S0000080	the construction process itself was streamed by state owned broadcasting companies and up to 180 concurrent viewers watched the process
YOU1000000002_S0000081	nearly every major broadcaster in china reported from the site publishing footage like what you are seeing now although very few western broadcasters were there
YOU1000000002_S0000082	this is part of the reason limited detailed information and footage of the construction exists outside of china is state owned broadcasters
YOU1000000002_S0000083	where the government can manage the story and what gets out
YOU1000000002_S0000084	it was no doubt viewed as an opportunity by the chinese government in a time when it faced intense criticism for its initial response to the outbreak
YOU1000000002_S0000085	but of course to gain that praise the project needed to be successful
YOU1000000002_S0000086	on tuesday january 28 significant portions of the 1st building were completed while the rest of the complexes foundations were finishing up
YOU1000000002_S0000087	over the 20 ninth and 30th more of the overall structure came to be as the walls were installed on and in the skeletons of buildings and work then began on turning these empty buildings into a hospital
YOU1000000002_S0000088	each patient is room was outfitted with 2 beds some medical equipment and a bathroom
YOU1000000002_S0000089	considering the hospital is built with quarantine in mind there are some unique aspects to the design of these rooms
YOU1000000002_S0000090	for one the ventilation system is built to keep negative pressure in all quarantine areas so that air will go out through an exhaust system rather than out under the door into the rest of the hospital
YOU1000000002_S0000091	while at the time of writing it is not entirely known to what extent this coronavirus can spread through airborne transmission a ventilation system like this is standard practice for any quarantine ward
YOU1000000002_S0000092	in addition to individual patient rooms separate areas were designed for patient processing diagnostic tools like ct scanners were installed and other crucial aspects like offices break rooms and canteens were built in
YOU1000000002_S0000093	over the 31st of january and 1st and 2nd of february the final areas of the complex were built up the interior installation was ramped up and all the systems were tested to ensure that the hospital was ready to bring in patients
YOU1000000002_S0000094	meanwhile 8 people is liberation army transport planes landed at wuhan airport carrying the military medical staff who had staff the hospital
YOU1000000002_S0000095	they moved into the facility throughout the same day february 2nd then throughout the night workers put the finishing touches on to the 100s of rooms
YOU1000000002_S0000096	then the next morning the moment that 10 days prior seemed impossible arrived
YOU1000000002_S0000097	the 1st patients transferred from other facilities were wheeled into shenshen hospital and thus marked the beginning of its operations
YOU1000000002_S0000098	they started with just a few dozen patients but in a matter of days this ballooned to 100s
YOU1000000002_S0000099	shenzhen hospital was only the start of china is plan to ramp up the number of available beds in wuhan
YOU1000000002_S0000100	just 3 days after sun chen is opening another even larger hospital called layson shan opened
YOU1000000002_S0000101	its 1600 beds and 32 words were built in just 12 days
YOU1000000002_S0000102	meanwhile other hospitals were converted to isolate and treat coronavirus patients and stadiums and exhibition centers were turned into hospitals as well
YOU1000000002_S0000103	still though even with this swift decisive action reports indicate that many of those with milder cases of coronavirus are getting turned away from hospitals in wuhan
YOU1000000002_S0000104	it unfortunately seems that coronavirus with its tremendous severity is one of the few things that can outpace china

YOU1000000004_S0000001	everyone thanks for tuning into another wordpress wednesday today wraps up our series that we have done on social media plugins
YOU1000000004_S0000002	how to use a hashtag all things kind of social media having to do with wordpress specifically we have looked at a lot of different options for facebook instagram twitter youtube pinterest all sorts of different networks
YOU1000000004_S0000003	so if you have missed all those be sure to check those out i will put some links in the description box below so you can check those out and get some ideas
YOU1000000004_S0000004	for how to be using those social networks to improve your branding reach and even to just improve the experience that your users have on those networks
YOU1000000004_S0000005	all right so today i want to talk about how to get your your posts in wordpress automatically published at least to face
YOU1000000004_S0000006	i have got a couple of other options that you will be able to get your post published across the board to a ton of different networks all at once
YOU1000000004_S0000007	but i 1st want to start off by showing you a free option because if you have watched my channel you know that free is always in the budget right
YOU1000000004_S0000008	so we want to look at and i am just going to show you one here for a 2nd this again is how to get your
YOU1000000004_S0000010	blog posts as soon as you click publish on a blog post we want it to automatically connect over to your facebook page
YOU1000000004_S0000011	and kind of do an excerpt little blur over there maybe also include your featured image over there and then of course put a link to get people to come back to your website
YOU1000000004_S0000012	now if you are only interested in using this for one network you know facebook is probably the obvious choice there it is not too much of a time saver
YOU1000000004_S0000013	but if you are really trying to connect across multiple networks this could really be a time saver for you
YOU1000000004_S0000014	of course if you are running on the dot com version of wordpress you probably know about jetpack inside of jetpack you have an option for something like this called publicize
YOU1000000004_S0000015	so take a look at that one that is available inside of jetpack if you have not wanted to use this because of just the heaviness the weight of what jetpack is on your website
YOU1000000004_S0000016	there is another option so let us do this we are of course in our dashboard we are in the add new area and i want to do a search for
YOU1000000004_S0000018	access press facebook is what we are going to search for so you can see that right here access press facebook
YOU1000000004_S0000019	and this is the option that comes up that we are looking for this is access press is the developers name of this particular plugin
YOU1000000004_S0000020	i am not making money off of advertising this i am just showing you a solution that i have found in the free range now it only has 99000 installs it is relatively new
YOU1000000004_S0000021	it has been updated a day ago so that is great we know that that this author cares to keep this plug in secure for us and then of course it says here that it is compatible with our version of wordpress
YOU1000000004_S0000022	so you always want to check that if this is later on down the road that you are viewing this video please be sure before you click install on this that it is up to date
YOU1000000004_S0000023	that it is at least been updated in the last 6 months that it is still compatible with your version and that it still has great reviews and a lot of active installs so you just go ahead and click install
YOU1000000004_S0000025	and because i am on engine with my hosting they of course give you a quick alert and say hey are you sure that you want to do this before you do a backup
YOU1000000004_S0000026	and i normally just go for it living on the edge people living on the edge
YOU1000000004_S0000027	once you activate it you have installed it and you activate it down here on the left side of your dashboard now you will have an access point to get in here and run through the settings
YOU1000000004_S0000028	now all that was pretty simple straightforward it is installing any plugins
YOU1000000004_S0000029	here is where it gets a little bit more nerd code style okay you wrap your brain around this do not get intimidated by this because all it is is simple instruction
YOU1000000004_S0000030	we follow the instructions click through and we are able to basically build what we call an api or a bridge between your social media network facebook and your website
YOU1000000004_S0000031	we have got to connect the 2 and give them in a sense permission to connect and that is what we are about to do here
YOU1000000004_S0000032	so step by step instructions of course it sends an alert right now it says we have not done it yet you need to go ahead and authorize your account to to connect with each other
YOU1000000004_S0000033	and you are going to be looking to copy and paste in some things here now this gives us clear instructions
YOU1000000004_S0000034	please visit here and create a new facebook application to get application id and application secret so we are going to click here and i have already got a few created
YOU1000000004_S0000035	all you do is click the green button that says add new and of course i am already logged into my facebook account and we want to connect it with a website
YOU1000000004_S0000036	so you click website and then here you go quick start for website you just go ahead and type in what it is
YOU1000000004_S0000037	and and as you walk through this at the end of this process it is going to give you the simple code that you copy and paste into these areas one
YOU1000000004_S0000038	and they will tell you that it is an application id and it is an application secret you will be able to copy and paste it in
YOU1000000004_S0000039	then it says click here to get your facebook id you will click there and it will tell you what to paste in there
YOU1000000004_S0000040	and that is kind of how you do it you are just going to walk down through all these options down here to the bottom it is saying do you want to allow us to auto publish your posts
YOU1000000004_S0000041	and your pages maybe all the other things that you have going on or simply just your posts for your blog it is really up to you you can make that choice right here
YOU1000000004_S0000042	and then once you have got all those settings in place you will click save settings and you will be able to start broadcasting these as soon as you click publish
YOU1000000004_S0000043	so if that is kind of too fast the other cool thing that is in this plugin
YOU1000000004_S0000044	is check this out you have got an option right here how to use and they have got a quick tutorial video that is probably a little bit more advanced than mine
YOU1000000004_S0000045	and they are going to really help you understand how to set all this up just take a moment and read through this i know we do not always like to read we like to watch videos
YOU1000000004_S0000046	but take a moment and read through these instructions this developer really wants to hold your hand and get you successfully publishing
YOU1000000004_S0000047	here is the other thing this really cool author will do is if you are looking to publish across a bunch of networks all at once they do have a pro version of this
YOU1000000004_S0000048	and i will put the link to this in the description box below this particular pro version allows you to publish to facebook twitter linkedin and tumbler all at one time
YOU1000000004_S0000049	and it is a $20 one time fee for you to purchase this pro version and install it and run it
YOU1000000004_S0000050	and again it has it has pretty good reviews it is still kind of new so and it is just again been updated this year so that is great
YOU1000000004_S0000051	if you are looking to go just big and you say you know what cory i am using 10 different networks and i really need a time saver and and i do not always like having to go over to something like hootsuite
YOU1000000004_S0000052	and still set everything up i really do want that one magic button that as soon as i click it it blasts out across the board i will give you one more
YOU1000000004_S0000053	this is a premium plugin and i will give you one more option here it is called next scripts
YOU1000000004_S0000054	now for free they allow you to use one network so if you are looking to do just instagram or you are looking to do just twitter or just facebook this allows you one free
YOU1000000004_S0000055	but the 2nd you want to do more than that it is going to immediately ask that you buy the pro version and i think right now it is on sale for like 50 u s dollars per year
YOU1000000004_S0000056	so it is a little bit more pricey 50 bucks but check this out let us see if i can show you 0 my word if i can show you like what all over here watch this
YOU1000000004_S0000057	look at this you guys facebook twitter google plus blogger tumbler flicker i mean there is instagram in here there is pinterest in here there is linkedin in here
YOU1000000004_S0000058	there is all sorts of ones that you can just check out and see what all is available look at all these just down the row here
YOU1000000004_S0000059	all these different networks that it immediately allows you to sync your website to and with that magic click on publish it will broadcast out
YOU1000000004_S0000060	of course each one of these as you install it you will have to make that connection per network at least one time you will have to set that up and give permission for your website to speak to that network
YOU1000000004_S0000061	and then you are off and running i hope this has helped you if you have used any of these tools or if you have another one in mind that you have used
YOU1000000004_S0000062	would you put it in the description box or in the comments below so that we can all kind of share our knowledge and grow our wordpress community
YOU1000000004_S0000063	i hope you are having a great one i will see you next week for another wordpress wednesday by all
YOU1000000006_S0000000	so you are looking to generate real estate leads for your business well i want to show you guys one of the top performing facebook ads that we have used with 1000s of real estate agents
YOU1000000006_S0000001	to help them generate a consistent flow of real estate leads for their business and if you guys want this facebook ad copy this template
YOU1000000006_S0000002	just go ahead drop a comment just say real estate leads down in the comment section and i will be able to share this template with you a 100% free so you can just copy and paste this into your
YOU1000000006_S0000003	so just go ahead drop a comment real estate leads down in the comment section and give this video a thumbs up now let me just walk you through this template
YOU1000000006_S0000004	and then i want to show you guys how to get this all set up in just a couple of clicks as well for your business so you know how to actually implement this
YOU1000000006_S0000005	so this is a facebook ad to market a new listing and the same thing works on instagram
YOU1000000006_S0000006	because facebook owns instagram so when you set up a facebook ad you are also actually setting up an instagram ad so that is pretty cool because you can spend $10 per day
YOU1000000006_S0000007	and you do not have to spend $10 per day on facebook and $10 per day on instagram you just spend $10 per day and it is split evenly between both platforms so you are getting the most exposure
YOU1000000006_S0000008	for your real estate business alright so right here we have got this your facebook page so this is the demo page i am using obviously but you are going to be using it from your page
YOU1000000006_S0000009	let us say jason wardrop and you want to have a profile picture of yourself because a big part of social media is personal branding
YOU1000000006_S0000010	you want to brand yourself you want to brand your business but you want to have it from your personal facebook business page so now moving down into the actual facebook ad copy
YOU1000000006_S0000011	i like to have some emojis because it kind of pops out at people they stop they check out what is going on and then also when you do the hashtag it makes it all blue and so once again that kind of pops out at people
YOU1000000006_S0000012	and then we have got see it before anyone else 5 bedrooms and normally i would put like how many baths as well right here but go here to get the price location plus more pictures
YOU1000000006_S0000013	so when you are generating leads what you want to do is you want to hold back some information or make something enticing enough for somebody to give you their contact information so their name phone number email address
YOU1000000006_S0000014	so you can actually follow up with them and connect with them to help them out with whatever they are looking to do so buy or sell a home right
YOU1000000006_S0000015	and so what we are going to do is we are going to kind of give a quick little rundown about this home but we are going to hold back enough that we are not going to give them all the information so their their interest is peaked
YOU1000000006_S0000016	and then we can actually go through and generate a lead so we have got this 1st call to action here and this is sending them to a landing page
YOU1000000006_S0000017	okay so i will show you what that looks like right here okay and we are not sending them to our website or our blog okay when you send them to a website or blog they are not optimized for conversion
YOU1000000006_S0000018	landing pages are and so that is why i want to send them specifically to a landing page okay and then the next couple of paragraphs that we are going to have right here
YOU1000000006_S0000019	is a couple of paragraphs talking about the features of the home key things that people are going to like find interesting are they vaulted ceilings is there a pool in the backyard
YOU1000000006_S0000020	it is a 3 car garage how big is the lot is it close to parks or is it close to schools or what tell tell me things that i am actually going to be interested in about this home
YOU1000000006_S0000021	and then last but not least i would like to wrap it up with a call to action to the landing page as well okay so right here we have got an image of the exterior of the home
YOU1000000006_S0000022	like to have one forward facing image and then if you want this is optional you do not have to but you can add more images of the interior but do not give them all the images
YOU1000000006_S0000023	because you want to hold some of the images back so it gives them a reason to actually go through and opt in so now what we are going to do is we are going to set this up
YOU1000000006_S0000024	so that we are showing this to people in your specific community and then when they are scrolling through their facebook or instagram newsfeed on their mobile phone or on their desktop whatever it is
YOU1000000006_S0000025	they are going to come over her and like 0 man this looks interesting i want to check this home out they will click on this and then they will go through they will put in their contact information
YOU1000000006_S0000026	their name their email address and their phone number and they will opt in and become a lead
YOU1000000006_S0000027	so that is the whole process i want to show you now how to go through and actually set this up because it is nice to be able to go through and know okay i have got the facebook ad copy template
YOU1000000006_S0000028	i know i need to have a landing page but how do i actually set that up then how do i actually follow up with this lead and how do i get all this stuff implemented right
YOU1000000006_S0000029	so what i am going to show you guys this is a lead generation system and follow up system that we built out specifically for real estate agents
YOU1000000006_S0000030	to simplify the facebook ads and instagram ads creation process for you and not only the ad creation process but the follow up process as well
YOU1000000006_S0000031	so leveraging this in just 3 clicks we can help you follow up via email text message facebook message and help you generate leads

YOU1000000008_S0000005	facebook live is an awesome tool for growing and engaging an audience with some very simple tips and some very quick pre livestream preparation you can easily get professional results
YOU1000000008_S0000006	so we are going to run through 7 steps to help you do just that
YOU1000000008_S0000007	but as we are going through do not get too excited with any one specific tip and jump off and try to implement it straightaway
YOU1000000008_S0000008	we are giving you a process here with tips along the way that you can implement for your next live stream
YOU1000000008_S0000009	i am also going to share my number one tool for getting more viewers on your shiny new professional looking facebook livestream
YOU1000000008_S0000010	and while we are going through make sure you let us know in the comments what your number one tip is for maximizing results when going live on facebook
YOU1000000008_S0000011	all right so 1st off before you go live there is a few things that you need to do number one is to plan your content
YOU1000000008_S0000012	so what you will want for that is a simple structure of everything that you are going to cover everything that you want to cover in your livestream
YOU1000000008_S0000013	so your structure will have things like a hook which is before the introduction this is the thing that hooks your viewer to stick around for your life
YOU1000000008_S0000014	you will also then want an introduction so talk about the things that you are going to cover in the video then you can jump into the actual content itself
YOU1000000008_S0000015	after you have delivered the content sure to have a recap or a summary to summarize everything that you have given them
YOU1000000008_S0000016	and then a call to action which is the next step that you want your viewers to take after your facebook live has finished
YOU1000000008_S0000017	that is a really simple structure not just for your facebook lives but also for your videos as well number 2 is to pick a location
YOU1000000008_S0000018	now you want to pick a location that matches your videos that you are actually creating you want somewhere that is quiet somewhere that is out of the way
YOU1000000008_S0000019	do not want to be getting distracted or interrupted while you are actually live
YOU1000000008_S0000020	you have all seen that video where a little kid walks in during a live stream
YOU1000000008_S0000021	do not want that to happen for you to try and pick somewhere out of the way somewhere that is quiet with as little environmental variables as possible
YOU1000000008_S0000022	so that is things like light changing outside or clouds coming over trucks or planes making a heap of noise
YOU1000000008_S0000023	to try and pick somewhere nice and quiet where you can just focus on delivering the content
YOU1000000008_S0000024	you also want to make sure that you are not picking a location that is distracting for your viewers you want your viewers to focus on you and the content you are delivering not being distracted with what is going on behind you
YOU1000000008_S0000025	step number 3 is to test your internet before you go live it is a really good idea to at least have an understanding of how good or how bad your internet is
YOU1000000008_S0000026	so if you head over to speed test dot net or you can download the app for your iphone or your android device and run a speed test for the internet connection that you are connected to
YOU1000000008_S0000027	the most important thing that you are looking for here is that number one that the internet you have got is stable and that that little speed test is not bouncing around all over the place
YOU1000000008_S0000028	but also you want to focus on your upload speed so your upload speed is what is important here not so much you download speed
YOU1000000008_S0000029	and you want to make sure that ideally you have got at least 2 to 2.5 megabits per 2nd upload
YOU1000000008_S0000030	if you have got 2 to 2.5 megabits per 2nd upload then that will be enough for facebook live but you do need to be aware of other people that are sharing the same internet connection
YOU1000000008_S0000031	you are on an office wifi or work connection other people may start downloading files and kill your internet for you
YOU1000000008_S0000032	so you want to run a few tests not just one run a few ideally 15 to 20 minutes before then a few minutes out as well
YOU1000000008_S0000033	so that you can really get an understanding of where your internet speed is at now if your internet speed is less than 2 to 2.5 megabits per 2nd then you have got 2 options
YOU1000000008_S0000034	you can either try to find a different connection or a different location or to use t instead of wifi or use your mobile data
YOU1000000008_S0000035	or you can still go live with the connection that you have but just be aware that you might have some issues
YOU1000000008_S0000036	and what i would do in that circumstance is if i am going to go live and i know that the internet speed is not 100%
YOU1000000008_S0000037	then one of the very 1st things i would do when i am live is to let my viewers know that we may be experiencing problems
YOU1000000008_S0000038	because you are not sure how good the internet is in that location so at least that expectation has been met in case there is any issues with your stream
YOU1000000008_S0000039	and obviously then if you are running your speed test and you have got higher than 2.5 megabits per 2nd upload then you should not have any issues at all
YOU1000000008_S0000040	step number 4 is to get everything set up so this means setting up your camera setting up your tripod if you are going to be using a tripod
YOU1000000008_S0000041	make sure everything is stable everything is at the correct height that you have got your audio and your light and everything set up ready to go for your facebook livestream
YOU1000000008_S0000042	obviously this is going to depend if you are using a camera if you are using your phone or if you are just using your laptop and a webcam to go live
YOU1000000008_S0000043	and there is obviously different recommended gear for the different scenarios
YOU1000000008_S0000044	but i will link up in the cards now to some of our recommended gear for going live on facebook live from your smartphone
YOU1000000008_S0000045	simple things like having a portable microphone and a mini tripod so that you are getting the phone out of your hands
YOU1000000008_S0000046	and into a stable position and that is really important no matter what type of video or live you are creating get your phone or your camera out of your hands and get it somewhere stable
YOU1000000008_S0000047	use a tripod if you can or just position your camera somewhere where it is not going to shake and move around a lot for your lives
YOU1000000008_S0000048	now if you are using a mac or a pc to go live you can use similar gear as well and you can either just use your facebook browser to go live
YOU1000000008_S0000049	or you can use software like ecam or split mix obs wirecast there is a heap of options out there for facebook live
YOU1000000008_S0000050	we have all got another video that we have just released and i will link that up in the cards as well covering off a heap of different options for going live on facebook
YOU1000000008_S0000051	but no matter which way you are going live the important thing is to make sure that everything is set up correctly and how you want it with as much or as little gear as you have before you go live
YOU1000000008_S0000052	you do not want to be tweaking and changing things while you are alive and that leads us right into step number 5 which is to do a test broadcast
YOU1000000008_S0000053	so this is where once you have got everything sorted press the like button but make sure that the live broadcast is only going to just you that it is a private live
YOU1000000008_S0000054	so in the facebook settings you get to choose who you want to broadcast to and there is an option there to broadcast to only me or just yourself
YOU1000000008_S0000055	so that way there is no one else that will see it so what you are looking for in this test is that everything looks good sounds good and that everything is set up the way that you would like it
YOU1000000008_S0000056	now if you are going live in a sales scenario you are doing this for a live promotion
YOU1000000008_S0000057	i would also suggest that while you are running this live that you do a quick run through of the content that you are going to be presenting as well
YOU1000000008_S0000058	so that way you will feel more relaxed because you have had a run through but also when you are watching back you can give yourself some feedback on how you went in your live test
YOU1000000008_S0000059	step number 6 is to tell people that you are about to go live now this could be as simple as sending out some tweets or some instagram post or facebook to let people know
YOU1000000008_S0000060	but there is also a really cool way to automatically post and email as soon as you go live with a cool app called live leap so i am going to cover that off in a few minutes
YOU1000000008_S0000061	but there are some ways to automate that process as well and step number 7 is to go live so the 1st thing you do when you go live should be to deliver the hook
YOU1000000008_S0000062	start talking to people as if you are delivering the content and the video structure that you had planned out do not stop to welcome everybody in and start some idle chitchat with people
YOU1000000008_S0000063	because that will not fly for the people that are watching the replay they are going to lose that connection with you so focus on the hook and then get straight into the content beyond that
YOU1000000008_S0000064	while you are alive you also want to make sure that you are making eye contact directly with your viewers which means looking at the camera lens
YOU1000000008_S0000065	not looking off to the side your viewers will be able to notice if you are not looking and talking directly to them
YOU1000000008_S0000066	you want to make sure that you are looking directly down your camera lens so that you are making that eye contact and that deep connection with your viewers
YOU1000000008_S0000067	it is likely that while you are alive you will also want to interact with your audience
YOU1000000008_S0000068	but it is really important here to try and batch all your live interactions into certain areas of your livestream
YOU1000000008_S0000069	you definitely do not want to break the content that you are delivering or the key teachings and learnings for your viewers with you
YOU1000000008_S0000070	dropping off and saying hi to someone as they come in or answering a comment immediately so for some live streams it could be that you break every few minutes throughout
YOU1000000008_S0000071	or in some cases you might want to save it all until the end of your video to do some interacting or some live q and a
YOU1000000008_S0000072	however you decide to do it make sure you let your viewers know how it is going to work and when you are going to be answering their questions and when you are going to be covering off the content as well
YOU1000000008_S0000073	and also be aware of anything that changes audio wise in your live streams
YOU1000000008_S0000074	so if you are filming outside and a big truck pulled up next to you then you might be able to pick up and move to another location while you are still live and presenting and interacting
YOU1000000008_S0000075	so that your viewers can actually still hear what you are saying instead of having it drowned out by a truck or some other noise
YOU1000000008_S0000076	and the last thing to remember while you are live is to have fun with your live stream
YOU1000000008_S0000077	if you are not having fun then it is going to be very difficult for your viewers to engage with you and have fun as well so it all comes down to you have fun with your live streams and your viewers will enjoy it too
YOU1000000008_S0000078	now i did mention live leap a few minutes ago
YOU1000000008_S0000079	so what live leap is is it is this amazing tool that lets you automatically share out your facebook lives the instant that you go live on facebook live
YOU1000000008_S0000080	and it will let you share them out to your website i will let you share them out through email through social media and to multiple facebook pages and facebook groups as well
YOU1000000008_S0000081	so an amazing tool to automate all of that so you just need to focus on pressing the go live button instead of sitting there sharing everything out the moment that you go live
YOU1000000008_S0000082	one of the biggest things that i hate to watch on facebook live is you join you are the 1st one to join or you know you join immediately when the facebook live happens
YOU1000000008_S0000083	and they make you wait they say 0 yeah well we will start in a minute i am just going to share this out live lep does that for you so that you do not need to worry about it
YOU1000000008_S0000084	so if you are interested in automating that process for your facebook live streams then definitely check out live leap and there will be a link in the description box below
YOU1000000008_S0000085	now if you are interested in taking your facebook live streams up another level adding things like titles multiple cameras effects multiple people

YOU1000000012_S0000003	if you are new here then make sure to click that subscribe button and all the links to everything you mentioned in this video you can find linked in the description box below so let us jump into it
YOU1000000012_S0000004	there is a lot of facebook live software options available out there and we have reviewed a bunch of them individually in the past we have also played around with a lot of other ones as well
YOU1000000012_S0000005	the landscape though is always changing with constant updates so in this video we put all the major players head to head comparing the pros and the cons
YOU1000000012_S0000006	to help you decide which is the best for your facebook livestream so whether it is multi person interviews live screen sharing or on screen chat
YOU1000000012_S0000007	just fancy branding or animations 3rd party facebook live software can unlock a huge range of functionality that you just can not get with facebook is standard apps
YOU1000000012_S0000008	so in this video we are going to tackle my top solutions for the most popular types of facebook livestreams including 2 person more than 2 person
YOU1000000012_S0000009	and live with screensharing capabilities and make sure you stick around to the end because i am also going to give you my number one tip for automatically sharing your facebook live links
YOU1000000012_S0000010	to get more of your audience onto your live streams the moment you go live so these are in no particular order and they range in price from 3 to $695
YOU1000000012_S0000011	what is best for you will depend on what you are looking to achieve the platforms and devices you are using and your budget so make sure you stick around to hear the full 6
YOU1000000012_S0000012	so that you do not miss out so straight off the bat the 1st one that we need to mention is the facebook website
YOU1000000012_S0000013	the easiest way to go live in a lot of cases is just to use the facebook website with your webcam choose to create a new post and click live
YOU1000000012_S0000014	and then you are broadcasting live directly from your laptop or computer with just your webcam so it is probably the easiest way to go live
YOU1000000012_S0000015	from your desktop without the need for any other software or platform so the biggest advantage with this is that you do not need anything else you are not paying for any subscriptions
YOU1000000012_S0000016	you have literally got all that you need in the facebook website and with a recent update you can now share your computer screen on your facebook lives just using the facebook website as well
YOU1000000012_S0000017	so the biggest disadvantages then is that you do not have any advanced control so you do not have the ability to bring anyone else in or to really do anything fancy with your live streaming on facebook
YOU1000000012_S0000018	option number 2 is to use live broadcasting or live streaming software like obs or open broadcaster software and wirecast studio
YOU1000000012_S0000019	now both of these are fairly complex solutions these will give you a professional range of tools for creating professional looking live streams
YOU1000000012_S0000020	things like being able to bring in multiple camera angles and seamlessly switch between them to have multiple screen shares
YOU1000000012_S0000021	to really have a full range of control and customizability over your live streams we have done a full comparison of obs and comparing it to wirecast
YOU1000000012_S0000022	and i will link that up in the cards now if you are interested in that but one of the major differences between the 2 is the price obs which runs on mac and linux is free 100% free
YOU1000000012_S0000023	which studio on the other hand which runs on both mac and pc currently sells for $695 which is just actually had a decent price increase from $495
YOU1000000012_S0000024	the biggest difference though between the 2 is the level of control and customizability and also the ease of use
YOU1000000012_S0000025	wirecast at that price point is much much easier to set up and use and that is actually one of my go to solutions for professional live streams
YOU1000000012_S0000026	what we use for all our client projects in the latest update though from wirecast where they got their price increase as well
YOU1000000012_S0000027	they have actually announced a really decent feature a really cool feature which lets you bring in guests to interview them live seamlessly using the wirecast software
YOU1000000012_S0000028	so it would be similar to bringing someone in on a skype call so that you can bring someone in and interview them and go live through wirecast as well
YOU1000000012_S0000029	you can do a similar sort of thing with obs and bring in guests using applications like skype and screen sharing that skype call but it can get pretty complicated and pretty messy
YOU1000000012_S0000030	especially when you are trying to sort out your audio issues and removing echo and yeah it is possible but it is definitely complicated and that is probably the biggest thing with these 2
YOU1000000012_S0000031	they are not for the faint hearted you definitely need to invest some time into obs or wirecast to get up to speed because you have got so much control over your live streams in
YOU1000000012_S0000032	both of these will not only let you broadcast to facebook live they will both let you also broadcast to other livestreaming platforms like youtube live with periscope and a heap of others out there as well
YOU1000000012_S0000033	so both great solutions if you want a really professional looking live stream with multiple cameras and yeah complicated setups
YOU1000000012_S0000034	solution number 3 is a piece of software called ecam live ecam live will work on mac only and you can pick it up for 2999
YOU1000000012_S0000035	crazy cheap especially when you are comparing it to wirecast at $695
YOU1000000012_S0000036	so what ecam live will let you do is broadcast live currently just to facebook live but they have announced that they will have tm
YOU1000000012_S0000037	opening up their broadcasting capabilities to other streaming platforms like youtube periscope and others as well
YOU1000000012_S0000038	very very soon they have also just announce that they are going to be integrating skype into ecam live as well so you will have that ability to use skype
YOU1000000012_S0000039	to make calls and live interviews without all the headaches that you can have using wirecast and obs so that is an amazing feat
YOU1000000012_S0000040	it is crazy that you are getting all of this for under $30 it is actually one of the most complete ways or most polished ways to go live on facebook live
YOU1000000012_S0000041	and to be able to see and monitor all your interactions and hats and comments and things as you are live that you would normally get on the facebook live mobile app to go live from the
YOU1000000012_S0000042	so it is amazing that you get this in a desktop app again it is currently mac only hopefully somewhere in the future they will also release a pc version
YOU1000000012_S0000043	but if you are on mac this piece of software is an absolute no brainer ecam live also lets you easily share your computer screen or playback videos as well
YOU1000000012_S0000044	if you have got videos cued up that you want to play in your live stream with the click of a button you can be playing those out and it also supports local disk recording as well
YOU1000000012_S0000045	so whatever you are broadcasting live you are also saving that live stream to your computer with a one click upload to youtube once you have finished your facebook livestream
YOU1000000012_S0000046	so that is pretty cool solution number 4 is a really popular web platform called belive so the website is be live dot tv
YOU1000000012_S0000047	so what this lets you do is run everything from your web browser so you do not need to download any software or install anything which means that you can use this on pretty much any computer
YOU1000000012_S0000048	it seamlessly connect through to any webcam or microphone that you have got set up and running on your computer but it also makes it really really easy for you to bring guests into your livestream
YOU1000000012_S0000049	so no one needs to download or install any software you literally just send out the link people can join a waiting room where you can see while you are live that they are there waiting
YOU1000000012_S0000050	and you can invite them on so you are not limited to just bringing one guest on you can actually have 2 guests on so 3 people live on your facebook livestream currently
YOU1000000012_S0000051	you also get some amazing control over your facebook livestream so once again you get to see from the blive interface all your facebook comments
YOU1000000012_S0000052	to see how many people are watching you can actually promote or feature comments on your live stream
YOU1000000012_S0000053	all you have to do is when someone is made a comment that you want to feature or promote you click on it and it will be made big on the live stream for everyone to see
YOU1000000012_S0000054	so that is an amazing feature especially you going to be doing live q and as with your audience you can bring up the question or the comment that you are going to be addressing
YOU1000000012_S0000055	so really cool feature and it is so easy to use this is probably the easiest app out of all the ones we have mentioned and going to be mentioning
YOU1000000012_S0000056	besides number one the facebook website itself this is the easiest one to use it is the most intuitive interface it is really for anyone beginner through to advance
YOU1000000012_S0000057	be live also lets you share your computer screen easily as well and there is also templates that are set up or presets that are set up in be live
YOU1000000012_S0000058	so when you click them you can change what the view or the display is like for your viewers
YOU1000000012_S0000059	so with the click of a button you can switch between a full screen view of yourself to a 5050 screen split with yourself and someone that you have got on your live stream
YOU1000000012_S0000060	you can easily split to a 3 way split where you have got 3 people side by side so not only is this an amazing platform for going live
YOU1000000012_S0000061	it is also really amazing how easy it is to use to set up something like this in obs or in wirecast would take a huge amount of time to set up
YOU1000000012_S0000062	but also to manage while you are live now there is 4 pricing options for live tv there is a free plan which gives you 20 minutes free broadcasting twice a week
YOU1000000012_S0000063	there is a light plan for $12 per month which lets you do things like add a custom logo branded colors and you have got a limit of 16 broadcasts per month
YOU1000000012_S0000064	then above that you have got your standard package which is $20 per month and here the biggest difference is that it is unlimited broadcast per month
YOU1000000012_S0000065	and you also get access to the advanced features like screen sharing custard branded frames and also early access to new features as they become available
YOU1000000012_S0000066	the other plan above that is the enterprise plan which at $500 per month is probably going to rule this out for a lot of people here
YOU1000000012_S0000067	with the additional features listed as telephone support custom graphics and custom formats as well
YOU1000000012_S0000068	i would imagine for most people the light plan or the standard plan will be what you are after
YOU1000000012_S0000069	number 5 is zoom now zoom is another online platform but this one has the big advantage of being able to bring in a heap of guests into your live streams
YOU1000000012_S0000070	live streaming to facebook and youtube from zoom is actually a relatively new feature that they have added it did start out as video conferencing software and now they have brought in some more webinar style tools as well
YOU1000000012_S0000071	which obviously let you go live on places like facebook and youtube in zoom you get a heap of advanced controls over
YOU1000000012_S0000072	the people that you are bringing into your call whether it is just you and you have got other people as guests or whether you want to bring other people in as panelists or co hosts
YOU1000000012_S0000073	whether their webcams are on by default or muted or you can control all of that while you are live as well it is also got built in polling it has got a built in chat window
YOU1000000012_S0000074	you can interact with your audience while you are live from withinside the zoom call as well
YOU1000000012_S0000075	of the big advantages with zoom is how easy it is to create the live call or the live link and get that sent out to your participants or guests that are going to be on the call
YOU1000000012_S0000076	you have the call automatically scheduled and entered into your calendar so there is a heap of really professional functionality and reminders that are built in
YOU1000000012_S0000077	all around scheduling the call and making sure that your guests are there and in the right place and also helping them test their audio and their webcam as they join the call
YOU1000000012_S0000078	make sure that everything is working one of the other really powerful features of zoom is not only does it let you record your
YOU1000000012_S0000079	call your live directly to your local computer but it also gives you the ability to record your calls and save them in the cloud as well
YOU1000000012_S0000080	and when you enable the cloud recording it actually records 2 files for you it records the speaker view which is the default view
YOU1000000012_S0000081	which changes based on whoever is talking so it is the full screen version of whoever is speaking and switches automatically but it also gives you the gallery view as well
YOU1000000012_S0000082	so if you have got a few people on there then it would show everyone on the screen for that recording so to have that ability that you are able to record in 2 separate files
YOU1000000012_S0000083	the 2 different camera views is amazing so in regards to pricing in order to use zoom for live streaming you need to be on their pro plan which costs 1499 per month
YOU1000000012_S0000084	but you are also going to need to add the webinar add on to actually go live which costs an additional $40 per month
YOU1000000012_S0000085	so in order to go live on facebook with zoom you will be spending $55 per month
YOU1000000012_S0000086	so now on to number 6 which is crowdcast now crowdcast and zoom are fairly similar in regards to product offering both of them will let you have live polling
YOU1000000012_S0000087	you can ask questions to your people watching and see the results in real time they both have chat they will both handle questions but crowdcast is probably a more polished solution at least for webinars anyway
YOU1000000012_S0000088	what you get in crowdcast though after your live stream is some really advanced detail and analytics about the people that were there
YOU1000000012_S0000089	how long they stayed for where they came in from so the level of analytics and data that you are able to capture in crowdcast is pretty amazing
YOU1000000012_S0000090	crowdcast also has integration with zapier and with drip meaning you can get some great data and analytics through from your live calls into your crm which is a really cool feature
YOU1000000012_S0000091	crowdcast also has a multi stream feature which is actually what you will need to be able to broadcast your crowdcast call or meeting onto facebook live
YOU1000000012_S0000092	but this multi stream feature will also let you broadcast to multiple live platforms as well so whether that is multiple facebook live pages accounts groups events or you could broadcast live to facebook and youtube at the same time
YOU1000000012_S0000093	in regards to pricing crowdcast has 3 pricing options
YOU1000000012_S0000094	the 1st is their light package at $49 per month then they have got a professional package at $89 per month and that is actually the one that you are going to need
YOU1000000012_S0000095	if you want to be doing live to facebook live or youtube live and there is also a business plan as well for $195 per month
YOU1000000012_S0000096	so it is definitely not on the cheaper end of things so the main difference when you are comparing the professional package to the business package is the number of live attendees
YOU1000000012_S0000097	goes from 250 up to 500 and the cost for an extra live attendee goes from ¢30 down to ¢15 on the business plan
YOU1000000012_S0000098	but keep in mind that these numbers for attendees are not in relation to facebook live this is only for people that are attending your call or your webinar on the actual platform
YOU1000000012_S0000099	you are going to be using this for facebook live which is what we are talking about in this video then there may not be anyone that is actually attending on the actual platform
YOU1000000012_S0000100	they will be watching and interacting with you through facebook live so if all you are interested in is using crowdcast for facebook lives then you will definitely be able to get away with the professional plan
YOU1000000012_S0000101	so those are our top 6 solutions for creating awesome facebook lives whether it is bringing in screenshare bringing in one guest 2 guests or a heap of guests into your live streams
YOU1000000012_S0000102	now as we said there was a huge range in price there is also a huge range in features and capabilities for the different solutions
YOU1000000012_S0000103	now before we get to my number one tip to automatically getting more of your audience on your live stream as soon as you go live let us do a quick recap of the options
YOU1000000012_S0000104	and who i would recommend each for so if you just want to go live on facebook the simplest and easiest way with no additional guests then you can just use the facebook website

YOU1000000012_S0000109	and if you want to do a facebook live with 2 people 3 people 4 people or a lot more than you can look at something like zoom which is a cheap alternative to crowdcast which will also let you do the same thing
YOU1000000012_S0000110	but it is also going to give you more analytics and integrations with things like zapier
YOU1000000012_S0000111	so now for my tip to help you get more of your audience onto your facebook lives automatically the solution is to use live leap

YOU1000000012_S0000115	it is the easiest way to automatically share out your lives the moment that you go live without you needing to do anything across a heap of different social platforms
YOU1000000012_S0000116	including your website so i will put a link down in the description below if you want to check out live leap

YOU1000000016_S0000000	in this video we are going to run through exactly how to live stream 2 multiple platforms at the same time or how similar cast
YOU1000000016_S0000001	whether it is to youtube live facebook live twitch or almost any other platform we have got you covered in this video
YOU1000000016_S0000003	hey it is justin brown here from primal video where we help you amplify your business and brand with video
YOU1000000016_S0000004	if you are new here make sure to click that subscribe button and all the links to everything we mentioned in this video you can find linked in the description box below
YOU1000000016_S0000005	let us jump into it now with some simple tools these days it is really easy to livestream to multiple platforms in fact there is even a name for it and it is called simulcasting
YOU1000000016_S0000006	so that means you can easily create one live stream and push it out to multiple live platforms
YOU1000000016_S0000007	or streaming sources like facebook live youtube live twitch and a ton of other platforms as well
YOU1000000016_S0000008	we actually did a video on this topic a little while back but since then so much has changed and it is now become so much easier to be able to do this
YOU1000000016_S0000009	so i thought it was time to update that video and run through the new best ways to do this or the new options to be able to do this
YOU1000000016_S0000010	and while we are going through i want to hear from you guys what social or content platforms are you most active on when it comes to live streaming
YOU1000000016_S0000011	we are going to start to pick up our game a little bit on the youtube live side of things but we may look at other platforms too thanks to similar casting
YOU1000000016_S0000012	now you have really got 2 main options when it comes to livestreaming to multiple platforms
YOU1000000016_S0000013	the 1st one is to push out multiple streams from your broadcasting software now this is really only possible in software like me or like wirecast
YOU1000000016_S0000014	where you are able to set up multiple output sources so instead of just sending your live stream feed to youtube you are also able to add in an additional stream
YOU1000000016_S0000015	for facebook or for twitch or wherever else you would like to broadcast
YOU1000000016_S0000016	that was pretty much what we covered the 1st time we tackled this and i will put a link up to that video because that method still does work
YOU1000000016_S0000017	but the biggest downside with that is that you are actually pushing those multiple streams from your one computer and from your one internet connection
YOU1000000016_S0000018	which means it can put your computer under load but it also can put your internet bandwidth under load
YOU1000000016_S0000019	if you are going to be pushing multiple streams you will need at least twice the available bandwidth
YOU1000000016_S0000020	or if you are running 3 streams you will need 3 times the bandwidth that you would for one stream across each of the individual streams to be able to push them all out
YOU1000000016_S0000021	the other big downside of multicasting that way was the interactions of the comments they were all separate there was no way to pull them all together
YOU1000000016_S0000022	so you could bring in comments from youtube twitch and facebook all into one chat window for you running the stream to be able to monitor them in one place
YOU1000000016_S0000023	you literally had to go to facebook and then over to twitch and over to youtube to be able to see each one of those different comment feeds
YOU1000000016_S0000024	so while all of that was doable it was a pain to set up and it could be rather frustrating to manage and see everything while you are actually live
YOU1000000016_S0000025	but the option that i am about to show you now option number 2 will require no additional bandwidth will put your computer under no additional load and you will be able to use a larger range of live streaming software
YOU1000000016_S0000026	or platforms to be able to do this
YOU1000000016_S0000027	so what i am talking about here is a multicast or simulcast platform that you send your live stream to them and they push it out to the different platforms for you
YOU1000000016_S0000028	there are quite a few platforms out there that offer this service of rebroadcasting and redistributing your content out for you
YOU1000000016_S0000029	and in there you have got a massive range from super basic right up to enterprise grade and obviously the enterprise grade ones are going to come with the enterprise price tag
YOU1000000016_S0000030	so there is really 3 main options when it comes to those of us that are looking just to push our live streams out to multiple places without the need for enterprise stuff
YOU1000000016_S0000031	and the 3 most popular and my top 3 are restream switchboard and caster
YOU1000000016_S0000032	now all 3 of these make it really simple to push your live stream out to multiple sources at the same time
YOU1000000016_S0000033	so they all support things like youtube live facebook live twitch all the popular ones and they also have atp so you can really push your live stream out to anywhere
YOU1000000016_S0000034	using http protocol
YOU1000000016_S0000035	they also all have integrated comments or integrated chat meaning that no matter which services you are broadcasting to you can pull in the chat to one central location
YOU1000000016_S0000036	making it easy for you to either bring those comments and those chat elements up on screen in your live stream or just to make it easy for you to monitor
YOU1000000016_S0000037	and interact with people while you are alive and all 3 of those also have global servers where you can manually pick the fastest servers or the service closest to you
YOU1000000016_S0000038	to rebroadcast out your live stream with the lowest latency meaning that it is not going to add a delay or a big delay to your live stream for those watching on the different platforms
YOU1000000016_S0000039	it is really going to be almost instant if you are picking a server that is close to your location
YOU1000000016_S0000040	now it is also important to note that facebook live is actually treated a little different it is treated separately from pretty much all the other broadcast platforms out there and you will see that when we get to the pricing options
YOU1000000016_S0000041	of these services and how they treat facebook but it is all to do with the way that facebook actually lets you broadcast live to them
YOU1000000016_S0000042	and in some of these cases you are going to have to pay a little bit extra or a lot more to be able to broadcast to facebook or to multiple facebook locations
YOU1000000016_S0000043	going to quickly run through some of the standout pros and cons for each of these 3 for switchboard for restream and for caster to help you better decide which one is going to be the pick for you
YOU1000000016_S0000044	but this really is not a full comprehensive review or feature comparison of the 3 this is just the standout pros and cons as far as i am concerned
YOU1000000016_S0000045	to really help you narrow down which one of these is going to be the best fit for you
YOU1000000016_S0000046	all right so restream or restream io is probably the most popular and most people go to platform for multicasting or getting their live stream out to multiple places
YOU1000000016_S0000047	it is by far the most feature rich but it is also probably the most unintuitive or the hardest to use
YOU1000000016_S0000048	it has got the most advanced control in regards to the chat or the comment feed
YOU1000000016_S0000049	and it is also got api integration so that it is really easy to integrate that chat roll into your live streaming software like wirecast and obs
YOU1000000016_S0000050	it also has built in live transcoding which means that you can transcode or convert your livestreaming to different formats different qualities different sizes
YOU1000000016_S0000051	while you are live to match different platforms that you might be broadcasting live to
YOU1000000016_S0000052	and another great feature is that restream do not limit the amount of bandwidth or the bitrate of the quality of your live streams coming in or out of their service
YOU1000000016_S0000053	they also make it really easy to resize those different versions so if you are broadcasting a widescreen video and you want to convert it in restream
YOU1000000016_S0000054	so that your facebook version is going out in portrait they make that really easy as well
YOU1000000016_S0000055	there is really 2 main downsides to restream the 1st one i touched on already it is around having all of these extra features but the actual interface is not super intuitive
YOU1000000016_S0000056	it is not easy to find everything and it can get overwhelming and complicated to go through and just create some simple restream
YOU1000000016_S0000057	so it is really for probably the more advanced side of things
YOU1000000016_S0000058	the 2nd one is that they add their branding to your live streams up until you reach their pro plan
YOU1000000016_S0000059	on their pro plan they will let you remove their branding
YOU1000000016_S0000060	it is not just the branding inside of your live streams like a watermark on it
YOU1000000016_S0000061	it is actually into your social media streams as well so in restream you can set it up so that when you are live it will tweet out and maybe do a facebook post out
YOU1000000016_S0000062	but in there it is actually it has got their branding in it it has got mentions of them and tag them in your post so i think for anyone that is using this on the business side
YOU1000000016_S0000063	you definitely do not want to have that going on which means that you are going to need to start at the pro plan
YOU1000000016_S0000064	so it is not a deal breaker but it just means that you have got to be using that pro plan to get rid of all of that branding
YOU1000000016_S0000065	now when it comes to pricing they have split this off into 2 so you have got individual pricing plans and you have got company pricing plan
YOU1000000016_S0000066	there is a free plan that lets you broadcast your stream out to 30 plus streaming platforms
YOU1000000016_S0000067	but that does not include facebook there is also a standard plan at $16 per month and that gives you access to live stream 21 facebook channel
YOU1000000016_S0000068	it also gives it the ability in real time to switch or toggle between or on or off the different live streaming platform
YOU1000000016_S0000069	and then you have got the professional plan which is $41 per month this will give you access to 3 facebook channels and also it takes the branding off as well
YOU1000000016_S0000070	the transcoding that i mentioned just before is an additional $2 per hour for the length of your livestream
YOU1000000016_S0000071	from that they do have premium business and enterprise plans available as well
YOU1000000016_S0000072	this gives you access to 5 facebook channels on the premium and 15 facebook channels on the business and obviously the enterprise one is for those that are really crazy serious above and beyond that point
YOU1000000016_S0000073	the next option you have got is switchboard or switchboard do live now this is another really awesome platform to be able to multicast your live streams out
YOU1000000016_S0000074	they have got a really intuitive really easy to use interface it is so easy to quickly jump in
YOU1000000016_S0000075	link up your channels your facebook pages and those sorts of things and start to broadcast out from there
YOU1000000016_S0000076	once again they have got really great chat integration not quite to the level that you get in restream but still really solid and still they make it pretty easy to get it into your livestreaming programs as well
YOU1000000016_S0000077	and you have also got transcoding capabilities again to push the different versions for different platforms but one of the cool features that you have got inside of switchboard is
YOU1000000016_S0000078	that for each one of the broadcasts that you have or each one of the platforms that you are broadcasting to you can totally customize them up
YOU1000000016_S0000079	to have even individual branding so your facebook livestream could have different branding to your youtube live stream which has totally different branding to your twitch livestream
YOU1000000016_S0000080	even while the content that you are broadcasting out from your computer is the same you have got a different version or different logos and those sorts of things on each of them
YOU1000000016_S0000081	all managed through switchboard even little things like being able to bulk start and stop streams and multiple streams is just so easy to do inside of switchboard they make a lot of this stuff really really easy
YOU1000000016_S0000082	now in regards to the downsides of switchboard i think most of these are really based around their pricing models
YOU1000000016_S0000083	and the restrictions that come in at the different pricing models so 1st off there is no free option but there is a $99 per month professional plan
YOU1000000016_S0000084	and that is actually their lowest entry level plan now they do have a 14 day trial available
YOU1000000016_S0000085	but on that plan your live streams are going to be restricted to 5 megabits per 2nd and at a maximum resolution of 10
YOU1000000016_S0000086	but they let you broadcast out simultaneously to 5 providers and 2 of those include facebook
YOU1000000016_S0000087	they also have restrictions around the duration of your live streams and your multicast as well
YOU1000000016_S0000088	on that professional plan you are limited to 50 hours per month
YOU1000000016_S0000089	and 12 hours per live stream depending on the type and the amount of live streaming that you are actually doing none of those may come into effect
YOU1000000016_S0000090	may affect you too much but they do have 2 other plans listed on their website for business and for enterprise but neither one of them has pricing available
YOU1000000016_S0000091	you need to reach out if you are interested in pricing for those but obviously with those a lot of those restrictions
YOU1000000016_S0000092	have been moved or raised
YOU1000000016_S0000093	so now for the 3rd option which was caste or caster dot 0 now this is probably the new kid on the block
YOU1000000016_S0000094	and it is actually probably the most compelling offer as well the one that i am the most excited about there you go just spoil the rest of the video for you
YOU1000000016_S0000095	but this is the one that i think is going to be the game changer going forward and could really have a big impact
YOU1000000016_S0000096	on the other 2 options moving forward now caster once again is really easy to use
YOU1000000016_S0000097	i think the biggest reason that caster is super easy to use is that it is not filled with all the additional features and bells and whistles
YOU1000000016_S0000098	as the other 2 that we have seen now there is no ads there is no bandwidth limitations and there is no stream time or limits
YOU1000000016_S0000099	on how long you can actually broadcast for they even say on their website that you could stream 247 through their platform if you wanted to
YOU1000000016_S0000100	another big feature that caste has is the ability to do cloud recording so you can actually do a full recording of whatever it is you are live streaming
YOU1000000016_S0000101	without needing to save it locally on your computer
YOU1000000016_S0000102	just like the other 2 it does have integrated chat as well
YOU1000000016_S0000103	and they even show you on their website how to bring it into places like wirecast
YOU1000000016_S0000104	now what caster does not have straight out of the box anyway is those transcoding and reformatting options that you had in restream and in switchboard
YOU1000000016_S0000105	but they do have another service offering that ties in with caste that does give you access to all of those things if you need them
YOU1000000016_S0000106	so now looking at the pricing options i think this is really where caste shines i have a free plan with no branding no watermarks
YOU1000000016_S0000107	no restrictions around bandwidth or the amount of time you can live stream for totally free that will let you share that out to 5 publishing locations
YOU1000000016_S0000108	including one facebook channel they also have a $9 99 per month plan which gives you up to 10 publishing locations
YOU1000000016_S0000109	and 2 facebook channels and for 2999 you will get unlimited locations and 5 facebook channels
YOU1000000016_S0000110	now like i said at the start of the video we are not getting into the nitty gritty of each of these 3 platforms we are specifically looking at
YOU1000000016_S0000111	multicasting and broadcasting your live stream out to multiple platforms these are in my opinion the best 3 to do that and you can also see
YOU1000000016_S0000112	that there are also completely different offerings now if you are someone who is on the more advanced side of things and you are looking for all the features all the controls
YOU1000000016_S0000113	all the bells and whistles then you are really probably not going to be looking at casta you are going to be more looking at restream or at switchboard
YOU1000000016_S0000114	now obviously with those 2 which one is going to be the best fit for you you have really got to come back to those pricing tables and see what the restrictions are
YOU1000000016_S0000115	and what you actually get access to for those different plans
YOU1000000016_S0000116	but if you are someone who is not looking for all those advanced features and really wants the best bang for buck to be able to get your broadcast out to multiple platforms
YOU1000000016_S0000117	then it is really going to go hands down to kaster i really think that what they are offering especially for the price and even on the free plan is just insane and it is
YOU1000000016_S0000118	again it is easy to get up and running and get it working with your live streaming platform so i am going to quickly log into caster and show you how easy it is to get set up
YOU1000000016_S0000119	once you are logged in all you need to do is go to add a stream and choose new restream
YOU1000000016_S0000120	bump up on the side to give your stream a name let us just go test
YOU1000000016_S0000121	one and select your region
YOU1000000016_S0000123	i am in australia now so i will pick sydney but close choose the closest one to you
YOU1000000016_S0000124	and press save
YOU1000000016_S0000125	next you need to do is to add in the platform that you want to broadcast to come over here and go add platform
YOU1000000016_S0000126	and these are all the supported platform so you can either choose a custom server or pick one of the ones that are present in here
YOU1000000016_S0000127	let us just use youtube now in this case you can either connect your channel by signing into your youtube channel
YOU1000000016_S0000128	or you can use your own server or stream key that is provided in the platform
YOU1000000016_S0000129	once you have logged in it says youtube is connected and saving this is where you can give your youtube stream a title
YOU1000000016_S0000130	test stream
YOU1000000016_S0000131	one obviously you want to come up with something a bit more creative you can add in your stream description in there as well and hit save down the bottom
YOU1000000016_S0000132	now you got youtube in there we can add in another platform as well just going through the exact same process
YOU1000000016_S0000133	so i will back out of this now cancel that one
YOU1000000016_S0000135	you can cue up all of your different platforms in here
YOU1000000016_S0000136	then all you need to know here is this is your streaming details that you put into your live streaming software
YOU1000000016_S0000137	whether it is split wirecast mix this is your streaming server and this is your streaming key so once you have set that up
YOU1000000016_S0000138	in your application and started your livestream then your live stream will show up here it says waiting for stream so then all you need to do is come over to
YOU1000000016_S0000139	your live streaming software for this case we are going to use obs
YOU1000000016_S0000140	and we will go settings go to stream and under stream type you want to choose custom streaming server
YOU1000000016_S0000141	and this is where you post paste in your server and your stream key hit ok
YOU1000000016_S0000143	and now when we hit start streaming we will see it pop up over here that our stream is coming through and then you can toggle on and off
YOU1000000016_S0000144	the different providers while you are actually live
YOU1000000016_S0000145	then you can bring up your chat overlay or the chat url you can visit to view and interact with the chat that is also what you used to bring into wirecast or obs
YOU1000000016_S0000146	or you can sync your chat with discord as well so now that you are all set up to livestream to multiple platforms with twice the potential audience
YOU1000000016_S0000147	that is twice as important for you to nail your lighting and to get your lighting looking just right great segway just
YOU1000000016_S0000148	linked on screen is a video which is the complete lighting tutorial to help you out with the lighting in your videos and the other video is a video from youtube
YOU1000000016_S0000149	i do not know could be good let me know i will see you soon
YOU1000000020_S0000001	magic gathering is a collectible card game it is strategic in nature it has got a little bit of hidden information where you are hiding your cards from your opponents
YOU1000000020_S0000002	you are playing your cards onto the battlefield attacking and blocking with them and trying to reduce your opponent to 0 life
YOU1000000020_S0000003	people collect the cards like baseball cards
YOU1000000020_S0000004	then they play a strategy game with them that is kind of like a combination of poker and chess poker and that you play with the cards you draw but chest and each card is like a different piece
YOU1000000020_S0000005	from the cards you collect you get to customize your own deck and your own experience and make it your own
YOU1000000020_S0000006	when your true foes reveal themselves will you do everything in your power to conquer them
YOU1000000020_S0000008	it has a fantasy flavor and feel to it that can be something that is very important to you all the way down to not that important to you at all
YOU1000000020_S0000009	one of the things that makes magic accessible to new players is that luck is absolutely going to be a factor unlike a game like chess where you will always lose if you are worse
YOU1000000020_S0000010	magic you sometimes win kind of like a little bit of a gateway you know it helps you feel good while you are learning
YOU1000000020_S0000011	magic is the biggest now that it is ever been by a lot
YOU1000000020_S0000013	think we get certainly upwards of 10 people playing the game worldwide
YOU1000000020_S0000015	no matter which language you speak the rules are the same everywhere your cars might be in english his car might be japanese but you both can communicate very easily
YOU1000000020_S0000016	when i was growing up most people who were you know playing games were not really seen as the cool kids but now you know there is professional gamers on you know tv
YOU1000000020_S0000017	this is just so much more a part of the culture than it was 1015 years ago
YOU1000000020_S0000018	all right i am going to play a 5th manard and then i am going to attack with my elders
YOU1000000020_S0000019	can block his elder beast
YOU1000000020_S0000020	with a shapeshifter it is already tapped
YOU1000000020_S0000021	for damage to your planes walker
YOU1000000020_S0000022	the game is just so polished and so well done
YOU1000000020_S0000023	it might just be the best game ever made
YOU1000000020_S0000025	good morning good afternoon good evening and good night
YOU1000000020_S0000026	you are welcome to our live exclusive coverage of the final of proto born of the gods will it be the ice cool shan mcclaran or 18 year old jacob wilson
YOU1000000020_S0000027	if he wins this match jacob will be the 1st champion younger than the game of magic
YOU1000000020_S0000029	has attacked even once
YOU1000000020_S0000031	really to not play the harmonica live here
YOU1000000020_S0000033	sean mcclaran is it static caste
YOU1000000020_S0000035	your bird of paradise and that is the san mcclaran is your champion he is king of the hill
YOU1000000020_S0000037	jacob congratulations i can tell of course you are disappointed who would not be
YOU1000000020_S0000038	right now i feel a little physically ill but i think tomorrow i can look back and be proud about this and hope to win the next one
YOU1000000020_S0000039	yep we will come back in the next one ladies and gentlemen your finalist a great ambassador for the game jacob wilson good job
YOU1000000020_S0000041	the magic pro tour is pretty much the highest competitive stage for magic there is 4 major events a year the rotors that each have a quarter $10 prize pool with $40000 to the winner
YOU1000000020_S0000042	you can only attend the rotors if you are invited
YOU1000000020_S0000043	you have to win a qualifier tournament just to get invited to a tournament that invites you to the pro tour
YOU1000000020_S0000044	probably a couple of 1000 people show up over the course of the weekend you know there is a live broadcast so the protons are definitely the mark events of magic
YOU1000000020_S0000046	this is an important tournament for jacob in a big way he had a bitter loss in his 1st pro tour i remember looking at him after that happened
YOU1000000020_S0000047	or somebody who does not show that much emotion on a regular basis he was destroyed by that
YOU1000000020_S0000049	2nd place is the most painful position to finish
YOU1000000020_S0000050	sometimes people joke about 2nd place being tied for dead last
YOU1000000020_S0000051	i think that might have been the 1st time we saw jacob like he has this kind of like flat exterior when he is playing magic
YOU1000000020_S0000052	and it was kind of shocking to see him be kind of like almost like crushed to lose in the finals it is like being dropped off a cliff
YOU1000000020_S0000053	right when i lost i was kind of in disbelief i had won 2 out of the 1st 3 games and i felt advantaged and i really just thought that it was a guarantee
YOU1000000020_S0000054	immediately after i was pretty devastated and definitely bitter i am jacob wilson and i am a professional magic player
YOU1000000020_S0000056	was introduced to magic when i was really young and when i was 15 i just started playing in local tournaments like once a week and when i got 2nd place at the proper
YOU1000000020_S0000057	i ended up going from like a $100 in my bank account to 30000 and like i was paying for school all by myself
YOU1000000020_S0000058	at the beginning of this fall semester i was qualified for the world championships it was a lot of work to do school and magic at the same time so i wanted to take the semester off and just prepare the whole
YOU1000000020_S0000060	right now one of my biggest goal is to win a procure and if i were to accomplish that it would be a huge achievement and definitely one of the biggest ones of my life
YOU1000000020_S0000062	tonight could definitely be a late night and i am a little bit too excited to sleep right before big tournament like this
YOU1000000020_S0000064	yeah i think it is pretty important to get a good night is sleep
YOU1000000020_S0000065	think most people try to
YOU1000000020_S0000066	a lot of people use like adderall to focus and stuff like that
YOU1000000020_S0000067	i got sleeping pills
YOU1000000020_S0000068	
YOU1000000020_S0000069	like to wake up long before the tournament so pretty soon i will be taking a sleeping pill and listen to some music and go to sleep
YOU1000000020_S0000071	the protein is divided from a lot of people is experience playing magic it can be so many different things to so many different people
YOU1000000020_S0000072	for you know the average person who is playing it is much more likely a way that they sort of blow off steam after work or just get together with friends or a way that they bond with their family members
YOU1000000020_S0000074	worry about the food
YOU1000000020_S0000075	yeah food coma
YOU1000000020_S0000076	what are we cooking today
YOU1000000020_S0000077	this is because we are going to have pennix and then we will have some stuff chicken breast
YOU1000000020_S0000078	nice when people get invited to the farino house they know they are going to get 2 things high level vintage magic and gramps
YOU1000000020_S0000080	over there is our collection cards that card that we used to play magic
YOU1000000020_S0000081	those cars there comprise a lot of hours of work hours of fun hours of family and friends recreation so that is really what it is
YOU1000000020_S0000082	certain cards even remember where you were when you open them like the cascade
YOU1000000020_S0000084	we always had a fantasy background starting from my oldest brother which read a lot of tokens work we all read the chronicles of narnia
YOU1000000020_S0000085	and then eventually i stumbled upon magic it was actually in the back of chemistry class
YOU1000000020_S0000086	i am jack italian nerd it is part of what makes me mad is a lot of the old stuff right here
YOU1000000020_S0000087	savanna lines and jade statues i mean things like this complete
YOU1000000020_S0000088	civically why this why the savanna lion is kept in plastic is that it actually singlehandedly on ralph is beta black
YOU1000000020_S0000089	that can effectively won this cup on this one bad black load
YOU1000000020_S0000090	they are very valuable think about 1993 when we are opening up packs you are paying $3 per pack now if you turn on to sell it it could effectively be a down payment on a house
YOU1000000020_S0000091	i mean it is just absurd what has happened to the game
YOU1000000020_S0000092	another reason you know that definitely love the game and why we play vintage is the older artwork like
YOU1000000020_S0000093	sara angel it is hard to have around simply because i have always loved the artwork
YOU1000000020_S0000095	this is the backbone of my deck is called miss workshop
YOU1000000020_S0000097	to me i very much gravitate towards the art i always appreciated the fantasy art aspect
YOU1000000020_S0000099	there were some early pieces of art which had some symbolism which i think provoke people to bring out the bad aspects of fantasy
YOU1000000020_S0000100	there were 2 cards in particular demonic tutor and unholy strength which had pentagrams on
YOU1000000020_S0000102	there was such a negative connotation to ritualistic activities
YOU1000000020_S0000103	anything to do with sacrifices and burnt offerings and all of these terms just started to surface
YOU1000000020_S0000104	magic the gathering so let us see where they are coming from how many see pentagram if you look there it is
YOU1000000020_S0000105	perception of parents well i do not want my kids playing this because i do not like the imagery
YOU1000000020_S0000106	here is one of the cards it is a dead rotting decaying thing that has been in the ground and remember it said that it is an occult game
YOU1000000020_S0000107	one of the dangers of this thing is that it is played with the mind how many know that the mind is a very fragile thing
YOU1000000020_S0000108	teenage kids their parents still had influence on what they could play
YOU1000000020_S0000109	now it is different
YOU1000000020_S0000110	they quickly retracted those printing and that really quelled a lot of the fires of the whole satanic imagery
YOU1000000020_S0000111	that negative paradigm that followed magic in the beginning years are now over and i think you are starting to see now the growth of it is changing
YOU1000000020_S0000113	i look at fantasy as one of my little escapes
YOU1000000020_S0000115	those couple hours that i am playing allows me to just you know i will come back to my problems when i am finished
YOU1000000020_S0000117	the proto player in particular it is a grind those guys will sleep on someone is couch one wednesday wake up next wednesday or elsewhere i mean it is a grind for those guys
YOU1000000020_S0000118	i just wonder how much fun all of them having there i am sure there are people that find it rewarding just not for me not for our community
YOU1000000020_S0000119	yeah absolutely
YOU1000000020_S0000121	we always made it communal we have always believed that aspect of it maybe that is why we gravitate the vintage so well
YOU1000000020_S0000122	you know we treat everyone fairly we try not to make people feel uncomfortable if they are new we kind of welcome them because no one is bigger than the game
YOU1000000020_S0000123	the game has to be about community
YOU1000000020_S0000125	like to welcome you to the profit for dc congratulations for qualifying and have a very very good weekend thank you
YOU1000000020_S0000126	keep your head straight in front of you if you are looking to the side we may misinterpret you are looking so please keep your head straight ahead of you
YOU1000000020_S0000128	i won the 1st round which is great it is always good to get off to a good start my opponent forgot something that would have benefited him
YOU1000000020_S0000129	like if you forget what your card does it is not my responsibility to remind him
YOU1000000020_S0000131	normally pretty quiet with my phone during the game i do not really like to chit chat
YOU1000000020_S0000132	he can be sometimes quiet he is he is a relatively quiet guy i have not really gotten to know him super well
YOU1000000020_S0000133	jacob wilson attacking for life using path to exile just a handshake
YOU1000000020_S0000134	he is always very even very calm and always finds the right place
YOU1000000020_S0000136	finally some through how do you beat jacob wilson moves on
YOU1000000020_S0000138	it is the end of the day and i finished 71 which is pretty great it is the best record i have ever had a brother i can not really ask for much more
YOU1000000020_S0000139	dude you went 7 and one today that is fucking insane i know that is great work thanks
YOU1000000020_S0000141	we are holding white bits of paper and that means it is time for the end of day rap jacob wilson is ahead of the curve
YOU1000000020_S0000142	you have already called it there you are saying jacob wilson for the win
YOU1000000020_S0000143	a terrific job by him and all these players here on behalf of everyone at wizards of the coast saying
YOU1000000020_S0000146	
YOU1000000020_S0000148	vintage is a great game not only because of the old nostalgia cards the alpha cards the dramatic plays the true reason why it is great is the community
YOU1000000020_S0000149	the people that make up the game are amazing everyone is friendly everyone is accepting you know you walk into a room and you will have 40 friends
YOU1000000020_S0000151	this is a vintage right now we are doing 8 man tournament just getting together with friends and playing cards
YOU1000000020_S0000153	my core strategy is generally to stop what he wants to do slowly picture a boa constrictor
YOU1000000020_S0000154	slowly wrapping around somebody and once he is in a perfect position now he can squeeze the air out of him
YOU1000000020_S0000155	but i have to get the board has to get in position 1st that is the best way i can explain what the deck wants to do it is planning
YOU1000000020_S0000156	how do you get there it is it is stopping your opponent from doing what he wants to while slowly reeling him in
YOU1000000020_S0000158	i would really say about vintage is it really is how the game was intended to be played
YOU1000000020_S0000159	and vintage is the purest form of the game it plays with all the cards from originally printed up until the ones which are being hot off the presses
YOU1000000020_S0000160	was the coast especially the creator of this game they kind of i guess believe there were errors in the original cars that were made
YOU1000000020_S0000161	they kind of wanted to put them away in a small place where they can be forgotten about
YOU1000000020_S0000162	they definitely let us out in the cold a little bit and that is why in the community we had to self regulate and why people look at us as the wild wild west because we have had you know a little bit of the cold shoulder from the parent company
YOU1000000020_S0000163	my opponent right now is greg felton he is very well known in the vintage community we you know we put out some really good players from here
YOU1000000020_S0000165	i got into looking at misprints of cards they probably should have been caught and destroyed by quality control but did not for example these 2
YOU1000000020_S0000166	there is actually no physical card here this has too much blue this has too much black ink there are miscut cards that come in packs my friend just found
YOU1000000020_S0000167	really did not have a story on it i thought they were incredible i thought i would get them framed at 1st but then every time an opportunity came along to get another misprint i definitely wanted to
YOU1000000020_S0000168	anything else in there that is worth seeing
YOU1000000020_S0000169	yes but i realized i actually can not show something here which i will show you guys privately yeah i just realized that is why i am stopping
YOU1000000020_S0000170	what is wrong with it
YOU1000000020_S0000173	today today looks like he has this one
YOU1000000020_S0000174	i would say the prinos are the godfathers and a lot of people do regard them as the creators of these certain
YOU1000000020_S0000175	anytime you bring up these old decks they are like 0 yeah the prinos built this built that
YOU1000000020_S0000177	talking earlier about tourism all these kids are kind of young you ever think that you would have tried to do that
YOU1000000020_S0000178	i tell you what they would there is a part of me as being a natural competitor i probably would not have minded the small opportunity to have done it
YOU1000000020_S0000179	it had been at the appropriate age right now we are trying to win a world championship in this format that is that is that is the actual goal but to answer the question i would have given a chance
YOU1000000020_S0000181	welcome to day 2 of proto fate before coming to you live
YOU1000000020_S0000182	when you get to the late stages of a tournament like this there is a lot on the line
YOU1000000020_S0000183	jacob wilson has been utterly dominant this weekend but he just suffered a brutal loss at the hands of eric fralick and if he does not make the top 8 that last play is going to come back to haunt
YOU1000000020_S0000186	here we are it is the last round of the day it all comes down to this if jacob wilson wins he advances to the final day if he loses he is done
YOU1000000020_S0000187	our 1st player seth manfield standing in his way jacob wilson
YOU1000000020_S0000189	alright here is lava spike to take jacob wilson down to
YOU1000000020_S0000191	down to 2 is jacob
YOU1000000020_S0000193	jacob is turning the tables and going on the offensive here he has got his guns blazing against seth and seth has fallen to 6
YOU1000000020_S0000194	this is just about as close as they get
YOU1000000020_S0000196	that is a rino that is going to do it jacob wilson has won
YOU1000000020_S0000197	he had a single copy of that card on his desk and it showed up at just the right time what are the odds
YOU1000000020_S0000198	how do you feel as seth manfield right
YOU1000000020_S0000199	i want to throw up
YOU1000000020_S0000201	i am very blessed i almost lost the things i almost lost even with the late i did not have the thing would have lost
YOU1000000020_S0000203	jacob was about to die to a lethal barrage of burn spells and then cast a drew his single copy of the white line to protect himself
YOU1000000020_S0000204	and his opponent had one chance to draw something did not and pulled out the wind
YOU1000000020_S0000205	from canada jacob wilson
YOU1000000020_S0000207	i win the proper that would be a defining moment of my life magic is the thing i put the most effort into and winning the proper is the biggest accomplishment you can have in magic
YOU1000000020_S0000209	hello and welcome to the last quarter final of proto therefore we are going to start off with elgersma against jacob wilson 19 year old
YOU1000000020_S0000210	returning to the top 8 of modern pro tour made the finals last year
YOU1000000020_S0000211	let us get right down to the floor and see who is going to win between your visa and jacob wilson
YOU1000000020_S0000213	and has every
YOU1000000020_S0000215	jacob is in game 3 and 2 out of 3
YOU1000000020_S0000216	elger vegesna who is a dutch hall of fame magic player so not an easy opponent
YOU1000000020_S0000218	game one elger had an instant win combo that involved making an infinite number of fairies that all attack at once for infinite damage
YOU1000000020_S0000219	then in game 2 jacob was able to survive despite the fact that elger reigned in anger of the gods that destroyed all of jacob is creature
YOU1000000020_S0000220	but then jacob summoned an elephant soldier called laxton spider that finished the job and killed year in game 2 so now we are onto game 3
YOU1000000020_S0000221	jacobs got a very good start but your stack is capable of winning in an eye blink so the suspense is pretty good
YOU1000000020_S0000223	voice of resurgence he is running through what could he have jacob does not have a lot of out here things are not looking good for him
YOU1000000020_S0000225	going to put this splinter twin on this pastor mike do you have a response shows the path to exile to elger who now will show him the spell
YOU1000000020_S0000226	and that should be
YOU1000000020_S0000228	game garriga advances to the semi finals over jacob wilson
YOU1000000020_S0000230	another great performance from young jacob wilson but it was not quite enough against the dutch hall of famer i know this has to be so disappointing for him
YOU1000000020_S0000232	you are graded on how many topete you have achieved i think that ultimately jacob is going to embrace that fact
YOU1000000020_S0000233	and as he start stacking up more and more top as you are going to see him accept the fact that there is something to be gained from making the top
YOU1000000020_S0000234	even if it is not winning the tournament and for such a young person he is already off to a great start
YOU1000000020_S0000236	there definitely is a balance of skill and luck and magic anybody can win the better player is often going to win but that is one of the main appeals i think
YOU1000000020_S0000238	having a variety of experiences be possible because of the element of chance is a huge part of just games
YOU1000000020_S0000240	magic is ever changing the cards are continuing to be good the sets they produce continue to be excellent and if that stopped the magic would take a step back but
YOU1000000020_S0000241	if you are going to keep making great cards and making the game interesting than the game is going to continue to to really excel
YOU1000000020_S0000242	magic is 20 years old you know magic is old enough that there are people who played the game when they were younger who are sharing it with you know their younger generation
YOU1000000020_S0000243	good game okay you want to play another round
YOU1000000020_S0000244	
YOU1000000020_S0000246	we have been playing for 20 years now it is such really a part of us that i am expecting to be vintage world 20 years from now and i am expecting to be the old man
YOU1000000020_S0000247	and when someone looks at me and he is 1820 years old and he says i got this old guy he is now he is doing he is in for a shock in for surprise to know that i am playing this for 40 years
YOU1000000020_S0000248	as long as i have the faculties to play it i will play
YOU1000000020_S0000250	i am definitely enjoying magic right now and i can see playing it for a while if this year does go poorly and i do not make platinum i would also be happy to go back to school and try
YOU1000000020_S0000252	to put more of my effort into that
YOU1000000020_S0000254	one invitational in richmond i am here with our champion jacob wilson congratulations man over the handshake is a little bit of hardware you are no stranger to this
YOU1000000020_S0000255	i will put these with my other one
YOU1000000020_S0000257	7 cards right
YOU1000000020_S0000258	7 yards
YOU1000000020_S0000259	really fun just started playing today and i am decent
YOU1000000020_S0000260	decent i am a new
YOU1000000020_S0000261	both nobs
YOU1000000020_S0000262	but we are okay
YOU1000000020_S0000263	we are teaching each other kind of
YOU1000000020_S0000264	we are learning
YOU1000000020_S0000266	kidding me right now i just need land on land and i can destroy you
YOU1000000020_S0000267	nothing scrub
YOU1000000020_S0000268	i did not know anything about magic until today except for that it was card game and now i am already obsessed with it
YOU1000000023_S0000001	fire emblem this magnificent franchise pushes the boundaries of gaming by daring to ask the question what if chess made you horny
YOU1000000023_S0000002	fire emblem is turning 30 next year and with 16 main games and a few spinoffs it is safe to say that it has grown into something extraordinary the games are packed with deep story lines and memorable characters like march
YOU1000000023_S0000003	that is not math math that is which one is math
YOU1000000023_S0000005	mars
YOU1000000023_S0000006	the problem with having such a prolific series is that the characters start to blend together one needs only to look at the super smash brothers roster to see that firemen characters are a bit hard to differentiate
YOU1000000023_S0000007	it is like trying to remember your co workers names after meeting them once at a work mixer except in this case your coworkers all have swords and can only make one facial expression
YOU1000000023_S0000009	but do not worry there is an answer to this conundrum because today i am going to teach you how to tell apart every fire emblem character
YOU1000000023_S0000011	face is just not built for this expression
YOU1000000023_S0000012	1st step in this process is to collect a list of the characters turns out even after trimming the non playable ones and the ones from the tokyo mirage sessions there are nearly 600 fire emblem characters
YOU1000000023_S0000013	i cannot explain that many characters i have made that mistake before trying to categorize all 600 sylvania monsters was a bad idea but the beauty of making mistakes is that you can learn from them
YOU1000000023_S0000014	and i now understand that explaining 600 discreet characters would not actually be helpful human beings are not meant to remember 600 people perfectly if you do not believe me just try to remember something about every single person in your contact list
YOU1000000023_S0000015	i have a contact for someone named jane and in the company it just says baseball
YOU1000000023_S0000017	who the fuck is this but unlike my contact list fire emblems have plotlines and in my experience playing these games i noticed that a lot of these different characters fit similar roles in their respective games
YOU1000000023_S0000018	i am not the only one who is noticed this on the fire emblem wicke there is a whole list of archetypes based on different characters a list that i only found after spending a whole day trying to categorize them on my own
YOU1000000023_S0000019	and it is just so fun to realize that you have wasted a whole day of work but this list intrigued me stock characters in similar circumstances playing again and again in different stories
YOU1000000023_S0000020	does that remind you of anything of course it does it reminds you of the commedia delsarte because it reminds me of the commedia del art and it is so obviously the commedia delete that i do not need to explain it
YOU1000000023_S0000021	but i will for the sake of extending this video the commedia del art was an italian form of theater that was big in the 16th to 18th centuries and it relied on stock characters wearing masks or costumes to designate who they were
YOU1000000023_S0000022	that way the audience could be like 0 that dudes wearing a tight fitting suit with a bunch of weird patches that must be arlana the servant clown sometimes to to master this brought the audience in immediately they knew what that character was about without any exposition
YOU1000000023_S0000023	in the same way fire emblem has dozens of recurring characters that get you through each game and this is how we are going to tell them apart by defining their archetypes
YOU1000000023_S0000024	fire emblem goes one step further because these characters can not only serve the same story purpose but they can have a similar role in the gameplay
YOU1000000023_S0000025	and this goes to prove my theory that problem is not only the spiritual successor to comedia del art it is its natural evolution an elevated form i call the commedia del anime
YOU1000000023_S0000026	the newer more perfect form of theater we just have to boil down the fire emblem personnel into syrupy stock characters let us begin with the archetypes that are standard
YOU1000000023_S0000027	cain and abel are battle brows they fight together but not in the biblical sense organ chords are similar except they are usually a fighters pegasus sisters are a trio of flying horses ladies
YOU1000000023_S0000028	you can not split these archetypes up into their solo characters because their bond is what defines them you can not have a aloisi without a log and in the same way you can not have a board without a cord which is my favorite drusa
YOU1000000023_S0000029	jains are mentors that are strong at the beginning and then you will quickly outpace them and it is kind of sad like the 1st time you beat your dad in a basketball game ifas are similar to jeans except they will keep dunking on you till you are dead
YOU1000000023_S0000030	windels are mentors but for magic go tos are mentors but only the last half of the game by wolves are mercenaries that you have to pay actual in game currency to recruit and ages are mercenaries that usually decide to join you out of their own volition
YOU1000000023_S0000031	which is by definition not a mercenary avars are silent moody sword swingers kind of like if that person who said they studied the blade actually studied the blade there are also a bunch of villains but for different reasons
YOU1000000023_S0000032	power ambition loyalty wyvern riding i guess and getting possessed which is a classic mistake
YOU1000000023_S0000033	some archetypes are based on their game play requirements very difficult to recruit usually recruited after they have been kidnapped late game recruits that could be good but you have to work hard super low level villagers that could also be good and if you recruit one of these pairs
YOU1000000023_S0000034	you can not get the other kind of like if 2 of your friends start dating and then have a really messy breakup corneliuses are usually the parental figure to the main character and they have this nasty habit of getting axed super early on in the game
YOU1000000023_S0000035	it is kind of like fire emblem does not know how to make interesting characters without making them suffer traumatic parental death
YOU1000000023_S0000037	tacticians young female mates young female healers young male mages
YOU1000000023_S0000039	thieves
YOU1000000023_S0000041	georges do that thing where they pretend to be not important and then surprise i was not an old crone i was a magical which the whole time except they are not very good at hiding the fact that they are important and the creepy version of the georges the skies
YOU1000000023_S0000042	usually they take the form of a small girl or adolescent except they are really 400 years old and a god or a dragon and i honestly do not have the time to unpack this bullshit
YOU1000000023_S0000043	these 29 archetypes are useful but they only cover 229 characters there are still 367 to go if we keep this up we are going to end up with 75 archetypes
YOU1000000023_S0000044	the comedian delatte only has about 17 so before we move on let us combine some these 6 are all mentors to varying degrees of usefulness these are all defined by their villainy and only some of them become playable
YOU1000000023_S0000045	welcome to can siblings incorporated where we all have a sibling like bond and do the same job these all have very specific requirements for recruiting these both do that thing where they do not seem important and then surprise i am important
YOU1000000023_S0000046	these are all hard to make good but they are worth it if you put the effort in these are all precocious little magic babies and that leaves the avars unconnected but that is because i am changing the archetype to spicy sorts
YOU1000000023_S0000047	because we can include so many other characters if we just expand the definition to any sword wielder who is a little spicy
YOU1000000023_S0000048	in fact by combining these other archetypes there are now tons of other characters who fit into these expanded definitions we are left with 288 characters to categorize
YOU1000000023_S0000049	but before i get there i just want to commend fire emblem for having 596 playable characters and only repeating 3 names when i was hired for my 1st job at a climbing gym i was one of 5 employees named brian
YOU1000000023_S0000050	and it was a small gym but i guess it is pretty easy to cut out repetitions when you use dope ass names like skrymir dagdar slope form belt
YOU1000000023_S0000052	i can go on all day but i will not because it is time to get the rest of the archetypes on the wall
YOU1000000023_S0000054	that took like 30 minutes but let us begin the honorable knight like fiona who cares passionately about her people and will always oppose cruelty to civilians
YOU1000000023_S0000055	which is way better than the loyal knight like rude who only is loyal to pen and will do literally anything for him even though pern is a bad dude but i will get to that later
YOU1000000023_S0000056	these 4 archetypes are calm and aloof and the only thing that differentiates them is how much you would want to invite them to your birthday party i am just going to get the blank slate archetype out of the way now because fire emblem is a game with pride
YOU1000000023_S0000057	and so sometimes you just need more meat for the grinder you know similar to the blank slate is the protagonist which is always relatively heroic but since they are conduit for the player they are all pretty vague
YOU1000000023_S0000058	i realize that by smashing them all together into one category i have made the majority of the firemen roster and super smash indistinguishable
YOU1000000023_S0000059	but that is not my fault super smash should have included more magic babies arrogance hotheads and edge lords all have a mean side but arrogance like like just think they are the best hotheads like caspar want to fight anything that moves
YOU1000000023_S0000060	and edgelord like nils retweet joker accounts unironically a lot of these characters have rough childhood but then turn out cheerful despite that and then there is the inferiority complex archetype which i could have just called the majority of children and fire emblem fate
YOU1000000023_S0000061	perfectionists mischief makers and flirts are all highly motivated but subak is motivated to meet high expectations cloud is motivated to make intricate schemes and sylvaine is motivated to be a fuckboy
YOU1000000023_S0000062	buzz kills are just characters that are not very fun to talk to and fire emblem i will never forgive you for naming an unemotional uber religious deadbeat dad gilbert it also does not help that i look like hannaman light
YOU1000000023_S0000064	0 god am i a buzzkill a lot of these archetypes are based around one singular personality trait scarlet straightforward babar is chill lienhart lazy sumita is clumsy petra is a sweet and randolph is a fury
YOU1000000023_S0000065	dramatic painter and fashionable are defined by their love of the arts and how much it sucks that they got to be a soldier instead some archetypes upset the status quo by defying gender norms or by calling out the noble class that is why they are comrades
YOU1000000023_S0000066	child soldier karen is canonically 14 years old
YOU1000000023_S0000068	whoops but even if they are not a child they could still be naive which brings around the overprotective archetype which is just essentially helicopter parents
YOU1000000023_S0000069	manuela is constantly drinking and flirting and just being a hot mess and i love her for it and that makes her the president of vices
YOU1000000023_S0000070	the vice president but be careful not to do that around someone like stram who is constantly accusing people of treason for no good reason
YOU1000000023_S0000071	there is a lot of characters in the meek murderer archetype because fire emblem loves to make characters that are quiet and shy and really self conscious and then can rack shop on the battlefield
YOU1000000023_S0000072	here is an archetype i call what the fuck and it is the 3 characters that make me say what the fuck fire emblem people like her who is said to be a sweet robinhood type except he does kidnap a young girl and keeps her as his slave
YOU1000000023_S0000073	or tara who practices curses on her own daughter or roger who is actually he is not actually that bad
YOU1000000023_S0000074	but fire emblem does go out of their way to make his end screen say that he never gets a date and he stays single for the rest of his life and it is like what the fuck fire emblem you did not have to do him dirty like that
YOU1000000023_S0000075	the next archetype is called actually pretty interesting these characters are 3 dimensional and well developed people like libra who struggles with his faith and has incredible self doubt even though he is doing all he can to help those around him
YOU1000000023_S0000076	or reese who dreams of being a sword fighter but his weak constitution will not allow him to become one and so he helps in the ways he can but his whole story is one of unfulfilled dreams
YOU1000000023_S0000078	and that is it those are the only 2 interesting characters and fire emblem until we get to raphael my sweet bulky boy who only cares about eating and training and not about studying
YOU1000000023_S0000079	the thing is the fire emblem world has moved past limbos and bimbos welcome to the age of jumbos there
YOU1000000023_S0000080	45 archetypes to help you differentiate the 596 fire emblem characters
YOU1000000023_S0000081	if you are a gosh dang rocket scientist 45 is still too much we can combine these we will take these 6 and combine them to create a new archetype that is as important as it is blind
YOU1000000023_S0000082	these 3 can be more succinctly summarized in a category called holy shit why are you a soldier let us just go ahead and run off all of the assholes and now we can take these straight talk and suck up and call them teacher is pet
YOU1000000023_S0000084	these 3 archetypes all have tough exterior to break through these 3 archetypes really explore familial bonds which is a rare condition in this day whether it is a good or a bad reaction does not matter to this group they just want to be seen
YOU1000000023_S0000085	they are just too nice for all this these 4 archetypes will always be subverting expectations it is fairly surprising that these 3 archetypes were let in chill dudes gambling a bunch of hunks damn if these are not fun to hang out with
YOU1000000023_S0000086	all 3 of these are going to timeout because they need to calm it down and there we go the 13 archetypes that make it possible to differentiate the fire emblem characters just 13 of them that is fewer than the comedia delta
YOU1000000023_S0000088	it is only 13
YOU1000000023_S0000090	which is not only an unlucky number but it is too large for your tiny child brains we can make it better we can combine more we can perfect this granted it is a little bit harder to combine these archetypes but just off the bat
YOU1000000023_S0000091	we can take look at me baby and making waves and just combine it into one thing trendsetters and the necessary but boring and the asshole crew and the teachers pets and the calm it down they all fill me with a sense of
YOU1000000023_S0000092	obviously the too nice for this and the light on your resume and the holy shit why are you as soldiers are all just a bad choice for a war
YOU1000000023_S0000093	that just leaves us with the characters that are hard to break the ice with and the ones that got family issues and the quiet ones and the ones that are fun to hang out with
YOU1000000023_S0000094	and that just sounds like a pretty run of the mill awkward family reunion and when you think about it these ones are just they are strange characters that have that are good i include dimitri in this he has an ipad
YOU1000000023_S0000095	which is similar to these edith and byleth have the the rhyme we also dorthea wears a hat until she grows out of the hat about that do not even get me started on aboro
YOU1000000023_S0000096	i do not know who that is it pronounced dice or dice and we can have a category called animal character with a singular personality trait and a pension for violence and that is just the one category
YOU1000000023_S0000097	which proves that the fire emblem characters are all essentially the same and that you cannot differentiate them mission complete
YOU1000000023_S0000099	was this unraveled about again

YOU1000000023_S0000108	we do not use it when we need to record
YOU1000000029_S0000001	polls have closed in 3 more states at 730 in the east at this point bill clinton has 58 electoral votes bob dole nothing yet
YOU1000000029_S0000003	cnn coverage of election 96 live from cnn center here are judy woodruff bernard shaw hill snyder and ken body
YOU1000000029_S0000005	and the biggest electoral prize at this half hour we can tell you is the state of ohio cnn calls that the state of ohio has been won by president clinton this is a big victory ken body for the democrats
YOU1000000029_S0000006	that is true no republican has ever been elected without carrying ohio and it is also further bad news because for the last 30 years this state has voted for the winning candidate
YOU1000000029_S0000007	cnn declares that bill clinton has won west virginia is 5 electoral votes
YOU1000000029_S0000008	not a big surprise west virginia is reliably democratic every congressman senator the governor in both houses of the state legislature controlled by the democrats
YOU1000000029_S0000009	polls have also just closed in the state of north carolina but at this hour it is undecided among the 3 gentlemen you see there on the screen
YOU1000000029_S0000010	judy this is fairly typical for north carolina this is a generally republican state in presidential races but george bush won the state by less than one last time his very closest state
YOU1000000029_S0000011	these next 2 are going to surprise if not shock you 1st in indiana cnn says that this one is too close to call and in kentucky again 8 electoral votes in kentucky too close to call
YOU1000000029_S0000012	look at the percentage of reports
YOU1000000029_S0000013	are 3 states where the polls closed half an hour ago as yet undecided georgia the peach state
YOU1000000029_S0000015	virginia the old dominion still undecided
YOU1000000029_S0000017	and south carolina in the presidential contest undecided
YOU1000000029_S0000019	let us move over to the electoral map to show you what we have so far president clinton leading bob dole 58 electoral votes the magic number is 270
YOU1000000029_S0000021	ohio is the story of
YOU1000000029_S0000023	and this half hour florida before that those are 2 big states and both in the clinton column
YOU1000000029_S0000024	if you look at all the states that we have just said are too close to call among all those states the only one i think if i wrote them down as fast as i could the only one that a democrat carried last time was georgia virginia kentucky indiana were all republican state
YOU1000000029_S0000025	so what we have is the republicans in a little bit of difficulty here mister
YOU1000000029_S0000027	well kentucky and indiana is fascinating that is fascinating and the word was that if if dale started out in trouble in kentucky in indiana if he lost them outright the night would be over
YOU1000000029_S0000028	we should say that he has we do not know
YOU1000000029_S0000030	in june he said if bob dole he calls himself bob dole he says if bob dole does not win kentucky bob dole can not win the presidency well we do not know yet but it is tight one
YOU1000000029_S0000031	right let us take a look now at the states that we know one or the other has won and here it is for president clinton florida you have been hearing this new hampshire ohio vermont and west virginia
YOU1000000029_S0000032	and that adds up to the what is it 58 we just count
YOU1000000029_S0000034	
YOU1000000029_S0000036	schneider you want to take over with the polls here and i will save thought i had
YOU1000000029_S0000037	okay we are going to take a look at the state of ohio a big win for bill clinton and see how did he do it well 13rd of the voters in ohio were union members in the household
YOU1000000029_S0000038	and they clearly went a majority a solid majority for bill clinton that big afl cio pushed for the democrats and for the democratic president paid off in ohio
YOU1000000029_S0000040	now let us look at the voters who decided how they were going to vote just in the last 3 days how did they end up voting well they voted for bob dole it looks like bob dole talked about his momentum in the last few days
YOU1000000029_S0000041	it was there those late deciders decided for him but they were only 9% of the voters in ohio what about the voters who decided before october who knew exactly how they were going to vote all along
YOU1000000029_S0000042	they were the ones who delivered for bill clinton and that was 70% of the voters in ohio so while dole picked up some late momentum
YOU1000000029_S0000043	it could not compete with a tremendous number of voters 70% who knew how were they going to vote before the month even started out
YOU1000000029_S0000044	you are very good with that john madden ought to be jealous tonight
YOU1000000029_S0000046	checking the watch it is time for crossfire here they
YOU1000000029_S0000048	live from washington crossfire on the left geraldine ferraro on the right robert novak in the crossfire
YOU1000000029_S0000049	republican senator john mccain of arizona adviser to the doll kemp campaign and in new orleans democratic senator john bro
YOU1000000029_S0000051	evening welcome to crossfire finally election day came with bill clinton casting his vote in the renovated train station in little rock arkansas and bob dole voting at the 1st christian church in russell kansas
YOU1000000029_S0000052	the other 10s of americans voting today decided 35 senate contests and 435 house races as well as the presidency president clinton is heavily favored for a 2nd term
YOU1000000029_S0000053	the big question is who controls congress what the republicans narrowly favor jerry
YOU1000000029_S0000055	let us pick up a little bit on
YOU1000000029_S0000057	talking about we have had ohio that has gone for clinton we have kentucky which said i must win a state too close to call
YOU1000000029_S0000058	see that florida has gone to president clinton if if doll is in trouble in the south do you see any scenario by which he could win this presidency tonight
YOU1000000029_S0000059	well jerry as i mentioned before we went on i just came off of the 96 hour trip with senator de we saw enthusiasm every place we went i think that california is still in play
YOU1000000029_S0000060	i think that there is a lot of southern states that went for president clinton last time and i certainly think that even though they may be quote undecided i still believe kentucky and indiana for example will go
YOU1000000029_S0000061	senator do but i do not discount the importance of florida and ohio they are important states
YOU1000000029_S0000062	so that so that with all things being equal if if this trend continues senator deal will stay in washington or go back to kansas but not be present united states
YOU1000000029_S0000063	well you know we have just got a few states and i would like to to see what happens in some of the other bigger midwestern states and also in the southwest as well as the south
YOU1000000029_S0000064	you take a look at the the senate races in a lot of the states too new hampshire has gone to a democrat there are other states where it is just too close to call and it is there are only a limited number of seats that democrats need to take it over
YOU1000000029_S0000065	what is your feeling on this you have been looking at the numbers all along
YOU1000000029_S0000067	my feeling is that we pick up like one seat i am sure that john b may have a different view but i think we pick up the 4 southern open democrat seats
YOU1000000029_S0000068	and the other one is really just are are too close to call like oregon and colorado and maine is a very close race georgia yeah so and arkansas is close so i think that it is we may be up very late tonight
YOU1000000029_S0000069	senator john bro this is very good news for president clinton but i wonder if you are popping champagne corks yet
YOU1000000029_S0000070	cause all the early indications are that you are not going to control the congress you are not going to control the senate or the house
YOU1000000029_S0000071	this is a kind of of welch merits you know what welch merits means it is a little bit of of sorrow and a little bit of happiness is not it
YOU1000000029_S0000072	bob you must be struggling this is devastating news for senator doll in a sense when you do not not carry ohio which every republican president has always carried and you lose florida that is very bad news for senator dole
YOU1000000029_S0000073	as far as winning an electoral victory and we are not finished voting here in louisiana we got about an hour and a half left and i am very confident that mary landrieu will be victorious
YOU1000000029_S0000074	think i would agree with john mccain my friend that the senate is going to be very close i would not be surprised if it was 5149 either way
YOU1000000029_S0000075	can you can you explain to me how by the way of course the winning ohio and florida does not come under the category of huge surprises everybody thought that the president was going to win those states
YOU1000000029_S0000076	i just would like you to address my my initial question senator on on how you can square the apparent big victory of president clinton
YOU1000000029_S0000077	with the with with an uphill struggle i think you have to win the house and senate and let me just give a suggestion of what is wrong you are dying in the south is not that right
YOU1000000029_S0000078	no not at all i think that we are going to do well in georgia i think we are going to win i think we are going to win in louisiana we are going to win in arkansas but i think the basic answer to the question bob is very simple and that is that people vote for their senator
YOU1000000029_S0000079	because of what he says or she says in their respective states it is not that connected to the presidential election i think you can have people voting for president clinton and perhaps voting for a republican senator
YOU1000000029_S0000080	we feel very comfortable in the south we got good moderate candidates despite an onslaught of this liberal liberal liberal charge for people who are very moderate to middle of the road candidates that we have
YOU1000000029_S0000081	is not it true that the problem is that some of your candidates in the south like mary andrew and louisiana and max cleland in georgia were election year moderates they have been liberals all their life and perhaps the voters saw through them
YOU1000000029_S0000082	bob it is really interesting they charging mary land with being a liberal here is a person who supports the death penalty supports carrying concealed weapons in louisiana and also will support a constitutional amendment to balance the budget that does not sound very liberal
YOU1000000029_S0000083	
YOU1000000029_S0000084	she has been charged
YOU1000000029_S0000085	also opposed the bill to ban the late term abortion
YOU1000000029_S0000086	absolutely
YOU1000000029_S0000088	there you go again falling for some of the republican rhetoric she clearly has said that she would have voted just like me and bennett johnson on that issue but her opponent and others keep saying well that is not her position that is what she said very clearly
YOU1000000029_S0000089	we are going to break right now we are going to come back and discuss whether or not there is going to be a majority in the house that is a democratic majority republican majority right after this break
YOU1000000029_S0000092	crossfire is brought to you by lci international a very different long distance phone company and by kreiser and the cab forward sedan of crisler what is new in your world
YOU1000000029_S0000094	welcome back to crossfire we are talking about election 96 with senator john mccain republican of arizona dual adviser and new orleans senator john brown democrat of louisiana
YOU1000000029_S0000096	senator let me just pursue this whole thing about republican majority in the senate just a little bit further because a lot of us are worried about what will happen once that democratic major republican majority comes in republican majority comes in
YOU1000000029_S0000097	are you guys going to go after the clinton administration again for another 4 years or you are going to you are going to get down to some serious work in the senate for a change
YOU1000000029_S0000098	jerry could i mention what real quick before i answer and that is that we are pleased to see the closure in the popular vote as you know many of the polls like abc had president clinton by 16 in the teens
YOU1000000029_S0000099	looks like that that is significant closure which could affect some of these other states but look jerry you would agree with me that what has been happening
YOU1000000029_S0000100	when this foreign money is really incredible and it is not being reported by the republicans it is every major newspaper in america there clearly has to be an investigation of that
YOU1000000029_S0000101	that is called if that is called going after the president then then yeah we will be going after it if we have the majority but i think that i mean i have been around politics for a long time the 3 of us have i have never seen anything like this i have never seen
YOU1000000029_S0000102	we just saw on the front page of the new york times today mister riady had what 12 visits
YOU1000000029_S0000103	senator to go to go out one of these things to do an investigation which lasts a month or 2 months or whatever is necessary to get the work done or to have one that goes on for years
YOU1000000029_S0000104	this whole whitewater situation has gone on for years with senator
YOU1000000029_S0000106	we expect that to come up again
YOU1000000029_S0000107	well what i hope is that we have howard baker on the democrat side as they did during watergate a bipartisan democrats will say look we have got to look into this and we have got to go at it
YOU1000000029_S0000109	hope so
YOU1000000029_S0000110	i will take you up on that john are you ready to play the role of howard baker and ask bill clinton what did he know and when did he know it about this laundered money from indonesia
YOU1000000029_S0000111	bob the problem is bipartisan it is a bipartisan problem just yesterday one person who was a supporter and worked for the dole campaign confessed to making a $120000 illegal contributions
YOU1000000029_S0000112	i think the american people want us to to look at some new campaign finance reform john mccain i think is a leader on this issue with along with our democratic side that is what i think the people want they want to make sure we do it right in the
YOU1000000029_S0000114	a great deal of time
YOU1000000029_S0000115	just harping on what has happened in the past because it has been both sides and both sides have to clean up our act
YOU1000000029_S0000116	well john is a realistic louisiana politician and you are one of the best of them you would you agree with me that a lot is at stake tonight for the president
YOU1000000029_S0000117	who controls the congressional machinery of the house and the senate as to what kind of investigation there is going to be
YOU1000000029_S0000118	
YOU1000000035_S0000000	hello and welcome to animal watch and this week we are talking the turkish angle dog
YOU1000000035_S0000002	there are a few breeds in the world who are known as formidable flock guardians
YOU1000000035_S0000003	one being the fear an immense tangle
YOU1000000035_S0000005	claim to have the size strength and ferocity to kill wolves in order to protect their flock
YOU1000000035_S0000006	claimed to have the speed and launch power of a ferrari
YOU1000000035_S0000007	and suggested to have a bite force that is the most powerful out of every dog breed there is
YOU1000000035_S0000009	possessing an old and ancient history that goes back 1000s of years
YOU1000000035_S0000010	some stories even suggest the actual wolf blood runs through their veins
YOU1000000035_S0000012	but what is the truth are these huge herding dogs mindless killers or simply protectors of the innocent
YOU1000000035_S0000014	are they suitable as pets or best left as working dogs
YOU1000000035_S0000015	and can they really kill a wolf or are they simply effective wolf deterrence
YOU1000000035_S0000016	today i am visiting carl westfield in the uk who is guardian of several angles
YOU1000000035_S0000017	and also one of the uk is top gangl experts sheela read in order to find out just what the temperament is
YOU1000000035_S0000018	one of these incredible looking dogs and also the truth
YOU1000000035_S0000020	
YOU1000000035_S0000021	anika
YOU1000000035_S0000022	
YOU1000000035_S0000023	these are these are my changes
YOU1000000035_S0000024	
YOU1000000035_S0000025	this is this is dave here
YOU1000000035_S0000026	
YOU1000000035_S0000027	this is dave
YOU1000000035_S0000029	what is your favorite thing i love it
YOU1000000035_S0000030	
YOU1000000035_S0000032	really always beautiful
YOU1000000035_S0000033	this is dave and kaas
YOU1000000035_S0000034	that is a pretty name
YOU1000000035_S0000035	i met carl is 2 candles and the 1st thing that hit me was how lovely they were really affectionate and welcoming of strangers
YOU1000000035_S0000036	dave his male can just wanted to be petted and loved to roll over and fall down in my lap
YOU1000000035_S0000037	the 2 dogs had an obvious roving curiosity and carl mentioned that he preferred to keep them leashed
YOU1000000035_S0000038	as their protective streak would kick in like a ferrari from 0 to 80 miles per hour if a passing dog went by in the distance
YOU1000000035_S0000039	even though they had just been introduced to this field apparently it would now have become their territory to protect and keep safe
YOU1000000035_S0000040	well carl these are beautiful beautiful dogs is the 1st time i have ever met a change dog you get this sort of idea when people go on about them being
YOU1000000035_S0000041	sort of these ferocious guardians and that that they are going to be somewhat unfriendly but they are so sweet and lovely
YOU1000000035_S0000042	they are with people and families and especially children
YOU1000000035_S0000043	you know a good king is completely solid temperament basically a calm until roused
YOU1000000035_S0000044	they can be confrontational if they consider that there is something outside of what they perceive to be their flock
YOU1000000035_S0000045	family their guardian their area if anything kind of threatens that then they yes they do come alive
YOU1000000035_S0000046	it is very very well documented that they are exceptional with children literally because for centuries they have they have had to grow up in villages
YOU1000000035_S0000047	
YOU1000000035_S0000048	with children running around and they can not show any undue aggression otherwise they would be fiercely treated
YOU1000000035_S0000049	tall do the candle stand
YOU1000000035_S0000050	there is again there is quite a disparity with what you think is is is is a massive change versus what is the reality of a change
YOU1000000035_S0000051	i believe if you if you do any googling or if you look up again on youtube picture
YOU1000000035_S0000052	wherever you sometimes see massive dogs generally originating out of turkey that are coming in at you know 809000 kilos
YOU1000000035_S0000053	these these are just these are just not change they are not they are not working dog they could not do a day is work
YOU1000000035_S0000054	these are more of the proper working angles that are out there yes with the shepherds
YOU1000000035_S0000056	there is there is there is small within a standard anywhere between 28 and 32 approximately
YOU1000000035_S0000057	heavy are the candles approximately
YOU1000000035_S0000058	anywhere between about 90 and a £130
YOU1000000035_S0000059	let us just quickly talk about dave is ears here because i know people comment a lot about cropped ears
YOU1000000035_S0000060	in the united kingdom we do not crop ears it is illegal he is an import and of course when they come in from working lines they have been cropped
YOU1000000035_S0000061	when they have been very very young and of course little dave here is is an import so he is not being cropped here in the u k
YOU1000000035_S0000062	carl certainly does not crop any of the ears and of course as you can see here on the female this is what they are supposed to look like
YOU1000000035_S0000063	so what is it like having a candle in your house
YOU1000000035_S0000064	such a big dog sometimes you can not hear them you do not know where they are and yet they know
YOU1000000035_S0000065	they constantly watch they will pretty much sleep with one eye open so they will know exactly what is happening anything out of the unusual then they they will let you know
YOU1000000035_S0000066	yeah so somebody rings the doorbell will they fly up
YOU1000000035_S0000067	yeah yeah they they want to know what it is yeah
YOU1000000035_S0000068	but somebody is walking a dog past your window
YOU1000000035_S0000069	yeah then then they will yes they will go mentor they will go mental
YOU1000000035_S0000071	came to greet you in your house would they still treat me exactly
YOU1000000035_S0000072	exactly the same
YOU1000000035_S0000073	just lovely dogs actually really really lovely dogs that have got a bit of a rubbish reputation i have got to say on some of the clips i have been seeing
YOU1000000035_S0000074	what is the life expectancy for a change because they are quite large dogs but they are healthy
YOU1000000035_S0000075	yes they are they are very very healthy it is normally fair to say that the bigger the dog the less long they live yeah yeah
YOU1000000035_S0000076	that is quite unusual with these because i have known dogs 141516 years old
YOU1000000035_S0000077	really good age it is a good age healthy age
YOU1000000035_S0000078	live and work for a very long time
YOU1000000035_S0000079	it is an unbelievable coat i mean if i rub my hands up here it is dense at the under hello dave
YOU1000000035_S0000081	so sweet
YOU1000000035_S0000083	it is so thick and dense is not it and like the undercoat is the same length as the guard here is not it
YOU1000000035_S0000084	and you can see how they can keep so warm up in the mountains i mean how cold does it get in turkey
YOU1000000035_S0000086	in the winter it has got to be -30
YOU1000000035_S0000087	is that yeah and of course they crop the ears out there because they can get frostbite and one of the 1st things to go is the ears
YOU1000000035_S0000088	as well of course if they come into a confrontation with a wolf wolf will latch on to anything that is hanging off so like the ears this is the only color they come in then i presume
YOU1000000035_S0000089	yeah what color is that cool
YOU1000000035_S0000090	it is fan with a black mask
YOU1000000035_S0000091	it is very similar color to access is not it that is why you said you get they sometimes get muddled
YOU1000000035_S0000092	yeah there is that of course they have similar acquittal
YOU1000000035_S0000094	they are not rambunctious they are not rambunctious or clumsy or anything like that they are just very very
YOU1000000035_S0000095	could have quite a small child with them and they are not going to sort of jump on them or scratch them they seem very very relaxed to me these dogs are very very aloof
YOU1000000035_S0000096	they are very independent if you let them off the lead yeah and they see something you were saying they could just literally go
YOU1000000035_S0000097	yeah they will always on a leash you have got to be quite brave person to let you can run loose
YOU1000000035_S0000098	it might be fair to say that if you get recall from your change you will go down in history
YOU1000000035_S0000100	when they go it is gosh they pull they really pull
YOU1000000035_S0000101	they have greater strength than what they seem to me from their size
YOU1000000035_S0000102	you got to be fairly young and agile and fit and strong to have one of these dogs
YOU1000000035_S0000103	fenced garden
YOU1000000035_S0000104	fenced garden because you were saying your boy he is a jumper yeah so yeah
YOU1000000035_S0000105	they are also they are also very very good diggers really very very good diggers they will dig under fences to get out
YOU1000000035_S0000106	that i think the digging comes back from summer time
YOU1000000035_S0000107	sometime they will they will dig for dig for a cool cool shade cool area
YOU1000000035_S0000108	and then in the winter time they go down in the slow exactly i will do that too what do they eat
YOU1000000035_S0000109	what do they eat what i eat fresh meat fresh meat and biscuit or kill anything anything
YOU1000000035_S0000111	i have got for them they survive on very little actually it is not true to say that you know they are big dogs and you have got to feed them £234 of meat a day
YOU1000000035_S0000112	no they survived they survived quite small amount of food
YOU1000000035_S0000113	maybe that is because of their breeding and you know having to be up in the mountains
YOU1000000035_S0000115	later that week i dropped by to meet a very special lady indeed shela reed respected across the uk for her expertise in the tangle breed
YOU1000000035_S0000116	both her and her husband michael had kept changes for decades now and had traveled out to turkey many times to source dogs from working lines
YOU1000000035_S0000117	if there was anyone who knew the candle better then it would be her
YOU1000000035_S0000118	we fell in love with the bread
YOU1000000035_S0000120	our old dog had died and we just wanted we wanted a natural dog we went to see a lady called missus betty marshall
YOU1000000035_S0000121	and she brought out her dog called fear he stood on his back legs and he put his paws on my shoulders
YOU1000000035_S0000123	he looked me in the eye
YOU1000000035_S0000125	and he looked into my soul
YOU1000000035_S0000127	that was it
YOU1000000035_S0000129	turkish people will tell you that they came with them as they moved up through into turkey they have been used for 1000s and 1000s of years
YOU1000000035_S0000130	and it is their role to protect whatever it is that they live with that is what they do naturally
YOU1000000035_S0000131	if you go into turkey and you go into the villages you will see the old dogs and if they are no longer fit
YOU1000000035_S0000132	you know and young out with the flock they actually stay in the villages and when the children start to wander off
YOU1000000035_S0000133	you will actually see the old dogs go and heave themselves to their feet but they will go off with the children
YOU1000000035_S0000134	to ensure that the children are never alone and they are their guardian so they do not march up and down being aggressive
YOU1000000035_S0000135	they just wander quietly along making sure the children are safe certainly can a dog can kill a wolf without any problem at all
YOU1000000035_S0000136	if you watch the kanga dogs dogs when when they are young puppies their mother teaches them in play and they will use their shoulders to charge
YOU1000000035_S0000137	they do not always win we had a very very sad story went out on a vaccination program in 2003 i think it was
YOU1000000035_S0000138	one day we went up to the top of the mountain to this village 1st and there were only 3 puppies
YOU1000000035_S0000139	and that was because the previous week there was a big big pack of wolves had come into the village in the middle of the night
YOU1000000035_S0000140	and the males had gone out and what had happened is they gone into attack mode with the with wolves
YOU1000000035_S0000141	the walls basically were winning
YOU1000000035_S0000143	so the people of the village got their burning staves and gone out but the mother of these puppies had been in a shed with the puppies
YOU1000000035_S0000144	when she could hear that things were going badly because it is usually the bitch that kills the wolves not the males she would broken free
YOU1000000035_S0000146	and left the puppies locked in in a safe place and gone out so between her and the villagers the walls were chased away
YOU1000000035_S0000147	but all of the males were dead but she was severely damaged they do take enormous care of their dogs
YOU1000000035_S0000148	and they worked very hard on her but unfortunately she did not survive and all they would got left were these 3 puppies and the villagers were absolutely heartbroken
YOU1000000035_S0000149	the turks do not recognize any dog called an anatolian shepherd dog
YOU1000000035_S0000150	to them the word anatolian shepherd they do not accept the word anatolian because that is just a plateau in in turkey it is it is a nothingness
YOU1000000035_S0000151	it was a word that was taken up by the americans to give it a name
YOU1000000035_S0000152	and basically it is it is a word that covers any big dog that comes from turkey any dog over 24 inches that comes out of turkey
YOU1000000035_S0000153	so it can be any color any coat length anything really whereas canada is a particular type
YOU1000000035_S0000154	if you look at an anatolian shepherd dog some of them look like and dogs because a lot of them might have in their background a grandfather or grandmother
YOU1000000035_S0000156	they are not a dog for somebody who wants a dog that they can wander down the road and go to the local park and let them off to play with all the other dogs
YOU1000000035_S0000157	they would be fine when they were puppies but what would happen is gradually that part would become theirs if they went there every day or once a week gradually as they grew up
YOU1000000035_S0000158	that would be their park and so they would consider that everybody within that park were people who needed to abide by certain behavior
YOU1000000035_S0000159	patterns civilized behavior patterns if some stupid dog comes up to it growing and snapping and snarling and biting at its face
YOU1000000035_S0000161	can a dog just
YOU1000000035_S0000163	do dog behavior and it will stand completely statue like which is dog language for your behavior is unacceptable please stop
YOU1000000035_S0000164	and if that does not work he will follow through
YOU1000000035_S0000166	in animal behavior patterns
YOU1000000035_S0000167	until it gets to the point where he has to do what animal behavior insists that he must do which is to pick it up and give it a good thumping
YOU1000000035_S0000168	which is not acceptable in today is modern world in today is modern world that will make him dangerous dog which he does not understand
YOU1000000035_S0000169	because as far as he is concerned he is he is followed all the patterns you know i have tried i have been very civilized i have said
YOU1000000035_S0000170	do that i have said i told you not to do that you know i have followed all the behavior lines
YOU1000000035_S0000172	it is not just physical strength you need them to know what you want them to do
YOU1000000035_S0000173	when we had our 1st dogs they knew that i did not want them to behave in a certain way at a certain place what they did know was
YOU1000000035_S0000174	they had somewhere where they could do that always our dogs have had somewhere where they could guard
YOU1000000035_S0000175	our dogs here we have got a bride way at the side they guard they run up and down and they shout and scream if anybody goes by that is what they do
YOU1000000035_S0000176	when we go out from here they know that that behavior is not acceptable
YOU1000000035_S0000177	we do not have a dog barking and growling and screaming in the car and we make that clear from an early age
YOU1000000035_S0000179	they are not a dog that goes around with their sleeves rolled up looking for trouble and they should not be like that and that is not what somebody should be wanting
YOU1000000035_S0000180	they are not aggressive what they are is they are there to take care of you
YOU1000000035_S0000182	they have my heart and soul and they will give you their heart and the soul they do not hold back ever there is there is no halfways they are an all or nothing dog
YOU1000000035_S0000184	that is the trouble with me i am an all or nothing person
YOU1000000035_S0000185	and that is what i like about them
YOU1000000035_S0000187	i was deeply moved by sheila is stories and found out information i did not previously know such as there being varying types of gangl
YOU1000000035_S0000188	some larger some more large headed some with more toes and some far more aggressive than others
YOU1000000035_S0000189	what was clear though was her deep unwavering love and respect of this breed a breed that she was keen to not have misrepresented
YOU1000000035_S0000190	a breed that would love and look after you with its soul and one that she wanted to be embraced by the world
YOU1000000035_S0000191	she backed up my conclusion that a wolf can kill a candle but equally if the conditions were right a candle could kill a wolf
YOU1000000035_S0000192	the walls of turkey and the surrounding areas are much smaller than north american timber wolves and this small size would equate for why they are killed from time to time
YOU1000000035_S0000193	but equally it was clear that wolves regularly kill the candles however what was most important was the dogs role
YOU1000000035_S0000194	as if more flock guardians were used the world around
YOU1000000035_S0000195	then there would be less licensed warf coles as farmers could then protect their sheep in a fair and natural way
YOU1000000035_S0000196	allowing wolves to coexist in the lands they all once roamed before industrial farming
YOU1000000035_S0000197	shela also nicely cleared up the gang versus anatolian shepherd debate and explained why these 2 dog breeds are certainly not the same

YOU1000000038_S0000009	in this week is episode we head up to del mar and check in on the wild
YOU1000000038_S0000011	very 1st scrimmage
YOU1000000038_S0000012	and i would not be surprised if ravin is head coach john hardball had his own fantasy football draft regular season is right around the corner we will let you know our picks
YOU1000000038_S0000013	and we will head down to snowhill and get our 1st look at this year is eagles team as they took on north dorchester
YOU1000000038_S0000014	but we begin today with a team right here on dimare that has some high expectations heading to the football season
YOU1000000038_S0000015	queen anne is now they held their 1st scrimmage this year on friday against saint mary is rising now the lines finished last year with an 8 and 3 record overall
YOU1000000038_S0000016	before eventually being bounced in the state tournament in the 1st round now they did lose a few guys from that team but they bring back a lot of key players and it is not just about what they are going to do here early on
YOU1000000038_S0000017	but it is about putting in the work that will pay off towards the end of the year
YOU1000000038_S0000018	it is definitely a work in progress really most of our line is going to be really young we are going to be a bunch of pretty much sophomores and juniors
YOU1000000038_S0000019	so it is just pretty much getting their confidence up and then everything will just kind of mesh together after that
YOU1000000038_S0000021	spencer you know the lions are one of the teams that every other team in the bayside north division actually circles on their calendar so they mean business
YOU1000000038_S0000022	but like this said this is a young team and they have to find their comfort level in their scrimmage on friday the line had some mistakes on both sides of the ball
YOU1000000038_S0000023	the program itself has not won a regional championship in a couple years and for this team to get back to the top of the football chain
YOU1000000038_S0000024	they need to feel comfortable especially since they have some new faces lines have the athletic ability but we know football is not just about athletic ability spencer it is all about the mental game as well
YOU1000000038_S0000025	i think you are right too i mean you look at they did have a couple mistakes early on but i actually really liked what i saw from this team the fact is you are going to have that early on in your 1st few images those are why those are there to work through that get yourself better
YOU1000000038_S0000026	and what i really was impressed with was bradley how calm and composed he was throughout that interview and throughout the game
YOU1000000038_S0000027	and if you can get that from your senior leadership especially when it is a quarterback you know you are going to have a pretty good chance at winning a lot of ball games especially in the high school game
YOU1000000038_S0000028	i think they actually have a pretty good thing here moving forward
YOU1000000038_S0000030	been there with 4 years with the team
YOU1000000038_S0000031	all right it was scrimmage saturday in delaware sussex central nights played host to the woodbridge woodbridge raiders and the stephen decter seahawks
YOU1000000038_S0000032	the nights were doing this all day controlling the game at the line of scrimmage at the quarterback running down and really having their way with the other teams
YOU1000000038_S0000033	and the seahawks had questions on who would be their number one running back but they got a few contributions from a few guys and look at that guy just go committee and now the woodbridge showed their ability to make the big play especially this guy
YOU1000000038_S0000035	i think it was the quarterback scrimmages especially for the raiders
YOU1000000038_S0000036	
YOU1000000038_S0000037	this group has actually worked super hard in camp we have we have tighten the bolts down a little bit in camp from last year in previous years
YOU1000000038_S0000038	and push the kids pretty hard this year i tell you he responded we have good numbers out and the kids were working hard
YOU1000000038_S0000039	and you can see the interplay
YOU1000000038_S0000041	now these are always good when we have those 3 team images or 4 teams opportunity to really gauge each other against you know some good competition the thing that really stood out for me was i mean we went to their 1st couple practices and there was a lot of questions as to what running back was going to take over for them moving forward
YOU1000000038_S0000042	and the thing is it looks like they have multiple guys they can do it i mean they had to guys out there that were really running the ball pretty hard
YOU1000000038_S0000043	and the fact is stephen decato that is they had guys that they were handing the ball to running hard downhill and they also had a guy that was about £250 and he was laying guys out i mean he was picking up yards on talk about falling forward to get the 1st down
YOU1000000038_S0000044	he was definitely get that done out there from jail and i feel like moving forward they got a good thing going there it is always nice when you have a couple guys you can hand the ball to
YOU1000000038_S0000045	i think with any team you know and whether it was the seahawks the raiders or the nights the best part about scrimmages be able to finally play against someone else
YOU1000000038_S0000046	i know this scrimmage helped each team get a good measure on how their offense and defense will really perform and no matter who is on the field it is all about who is going to step up under pressure and make the big plays whether it is a scrimmage or the 1st game of the season
YOU1000000038_S0000047	as coach no said the cream usually comes to the top
YOU1000000038_S0000049	and seaford they hosted a 4 team scrimmage yesterday which included parkside james and bennett and colonel richardson now a strong play for bill teams in this thing
YOU1000000038_S0000050	and speaking of strong place check out this run here by hayward i mean just knocking guys out of his way barreling downhill colonel richardson was moving the ball as well in this thing their quarterback sneaks here in the middle up the creek and
YOU1000000038_S0000051	making a lot of guys miss he is going to be a guy to watch this year park site on the other hand they were getting it done through the air airing this one out way downhill devin reading in that beautiful catch there for completion
YOU1000000038_S0000052	seaford they got it done on defense and i think that is going to be one area where they have improved a lot this year made a couple interceptions and it was good to see out of them
YOU1000000038_S0000053	well we were ready we were hyped for it and we all came in with the right intensity so we knew this was the 1st chance we got to actually put full pads on and play against somebody else so we were ready for it
YOU1000000038_S0000054	i think it was it went very well for us still things to improve on but coming out today and seeing what we had and we did a great job out here everybody executed well
YOU1000000038_S0000055	you know spencer actually being out there on saturday i felt like each team was actually playing for a championship one team that stood out from the rest of them were the rams and i mean their running game was on point finding the holes invading defenders they could do no wrong in my eyes
YOU1000000038_S0000056	on the other hand one of the teams that made some mistakes on both sides of the ball were the blue jays i spoke to coach darling and he said his team is too selfish right now and is trying to get them to be a more cohesive unit and you know the scrimmage is actually going to help them get to that better
YOU1000000038_S0000057	absolutely and it is always tough to that is his 1st year at the program so moving forward you kind of need to get that senior leadership and kind of establish yourself so i am sure it will be fine down the stretch but early on that is always tough to go but the thing that really impressed me was parkside i mean they had some guys down the field that were definitely making some plays at the ball
YOU1000000038_S0000058	that passing game looks legit and they have a couple guys to feel like you are going to watch out for this year and at the high school level i was a little concerned that they would not be able to have the playmakers and the time to get it out there
YOU1000000038_S0000059	but they found them in space and if they can do that throughout the year i mean this is going to team you are definitely going to watch move it forward sells the quality quality program
YOU1000000038_S0000060	well how do you feel about it we want to know so reach out to us on facebook or twitter send us a message there
YOU1000000038_S0000061	email us at 47 abc dot com or you can email us at sports at n d dot com that is let us know what games you want us to go to and also check out our polls online

YOU1000000038_S0000063	how you doing i am matt griffith from eastern high school head varsity football coach you are watching the delmarva sports inside
YOU1000000038_S0000065	welcome back well we are still talking some football let me tell you we got special special segment for this one
YOU1000000038_S0000066	our own tray miles who is a whig alum had a chance to talk to his coach about the program is direction tray were you tempted to put on some gear and do you miss it
YOU1000000038_S0000068	well i do not exactly miss the 2 day practices or the undescribable cent of that locker room but of course i do miss the game
YOU1000000038_S0000069	so i stopped my practice and chatted with my former coach now varsity head coach pat mcglinchey to see exactly what we will need to improve upon to return to the base dominance
YOU1000000038_S0000070	got my jersey on right now it has been 7 years can you believe that cost
YOU1000000038_S0000071	i can not believe it feels like yesterday
YOU1000000038_S0000072	3 and 7 was it kind of down year last year according to program standards what what what will change that this year
YOU1000000038_S0000073	the biggest difference between last year and this year is going to be team unity we stressed it in the weight room all season all offseason as soon as the season was over i realized a lot of the mistakes that i made as a head football coach
YOU1000000038_S0000074	you know i am going to put a lot of the blame on myself it is it is on my shoulders and i felt like our team was not together they were more about playing for themselves we had great athletes last year
YOU1000000038_S0000075	and we just did not come together and and play together
YOU1000000038_S0000076	my man nelson brown will be featured in this office talk about him and why he excels at what he does
YOU1000000038_S0000077	nelson brown is just one of those phenomenal athletes he is not an athlete that comes around all the time nelson is being looked at by division one football schools
YOU1000000038_S0000078	he is a scholarship kid and we are waiting on that 1st scholarship morgan state has been really looking hard at him but you know besides that he is just he goes out there and he is the ultra competitor
YOU1000000038_S0000079	he does not like being on the sideline whether it is in practice or on during a game so in a game he is going to we are looking at him really caring the load this year and really being the running back that he can be
YOU1000000038_S0000080	talk about a newcomer that you are expecting that you are really expecting to put some things on tape and really have a good time for you to share
YOU1000000038_S0000081	i would say the newcomer that i am looking forward to the most is ryan mccarter he is just at every single thing that we could offer he goes to the off season training the room the beach
YOU1000000038_S0000082	wherever we are doing training he is there
YOU1000000038_S0000083	you got a new guy here at corner andre coulston who when we saw him at the benak camp honestly in my eyes he was the best corner there talk about him and what what this young defense will bring to the table
YOU1000000038_S0000084	yeah our dack this year are pretty much all new like you said andre is one of those guys who is going to try to shut you down a line of scrimmage
YOU1000000038_S0000085	he is very strong he is little but he is very strong and he is very fast and you know we are really excited about all of them
YOU1000000038_S0000087	well saturday i had made the trip to wildcat country to take on 6 time state champion del mar and a little pre season football action
YOU1000000038_S0000088	there is that man nelson brown he was out on saturday with a shoulder bruise just precautionary he told me he expects to practice on monday there is another star shane leatherbury and he is a veteran and natural born leader of the wildcats i expect those young guys there to look up for him
YOU1000000038_S0000089	we know
YOU1000000038_S0000091	check out what he does on defense
YOU1000000038_S0000092	gets the pick right there he is out on the island by himself and this guy will be a natural born leader one thing i really liked about ai was their defensive line that right there is there savage breaking through and dropping leatherberry for the
YOU1000000038_S0000093	i am telling you him and memories are 2 studs on the defensive line this play right here by this young man requa carter is just a fabulous play look at him take it down through the middle and get those defenders out of his way that is just a filthy move excuse me thank you for a touchdown
YOU1000000038_S0000094	this kid is going to be a stud not to be outdone delmar junior dager brown takes the hand off straight up the middle 60 yards out and he did not even get touched folks he has got some burners he had a great scrimmage as well
YOU1000000038_S0000095	and for delmar coach dave hearn he knows that the preseason is all about figuring his team out
YOU1000000038_S0000096	the 1st week you are hoping just to keep everybody healthy and that 1st crime that is what we did today and make sure that we have learned something but if you have not got players that are what you thought especially the new guys the ones you are talking about
YOU1000000038_S0000097	then you may have to make adjustments or then you can figure out what they need and so then we will make adjustments ourselves because we are not just going to plug along if we are struggling particular area we will try to make some make some modifications
YOU1000000038_S0000099	if you know anything about delmar football you know cothern will have that team ready whether he has all freshmen or all seniors there is one there is a reason why he is a 4 time state champion there
YOU1000000038_S0000100	still to come the raiders of woodbridge on the field for some field hockey will tell you what they are doing to improve upon that 9 and 6 record from just a year ago do not go anywhere
YOU1000000038_S0000102	david wells inside linebacker for games and bennett and you are watching sports inside
YOU1000000038_S0000104	welcome back well the fall sports season it is officially underway and that means just one thing to sell it is time for some field hockey mean woodbridge they got their 1st taste of the preseason action on wednesday when they hosted a 5 team scrimmage
YOU1000000038_S0000105	head coach wheatley is team will be trying to make it to the state tournament after coming up with just one game short a year ago finishing with a 9 and 6 record that right there was sarah davis putting on the move from way outside and scoring just a beautiful goal
YOU1000000038_S0000106	and then just a few minutes later the raiders they were right back at it they found the net one more time this one was from brady keeler with the honors with a beautiful snapshot
YOU1000000038_S0000107	our goal is to get into the tournament and get really far into the tournament and i do not know we have been talking about it for a few years so i am just really excited and it is really important to me
YOU1000000038_S0000109	set those expectations
YOU1000000038_S0000110	definitely when you raise it up there and the fact is i looked at this team and i we went in i was talking with coach while they had they know they are able to score the ball they they knew they had a good opportunity of being a very high scoring team but they did not realize how good the defensively and they definitely showed that in the scrimmage
YOU1000000038_S0000111	i feel like they are going to be a quality program but what scares me is the fact they only have 3 seniors and they are going to be relying on a lot of unproven teams that does not mean that they can not do it but the fact is those guys have not had the minutes yet they have not proven they can play at this level so there is still some question marks moving forward
YOU1000000038_S0000112	i mean you are right having only 3 seniors is a little worrisome but sometimes you have to look past that number and see the group as a whole and you know growing pains are actually normal in high school and this team looks ready to step it up to the next level
YOU1000000038_S0000113	like the coach said it is about avoiding mistakes and learning from each game which is key in any sport
YOU1000000038_S0000114	absolutely and by the way congratulations coach coach wheatley she actually just got married a couple weeks ago
YOU1000000038_S0000116	the volleyball season well that is here as well several teams were taking part in their 1st images of the year on thursday snowhill welcome north dorchester to town the snowhill eagles will have some high expectations coming in this year
YOU1000000038_S0000117	and as for dorchester well it is a success even having a team on the court i mean the eagles this is the 1st time they have had a program reopening up this year now overall though both teams were pretty pleased with what they saw from their team
YOU1000000038_S0000118	really we are trying to work on the fundamental basics again trying to improve some serving some net play and really trying to put together an offense that is going to be a little bit more aggressive than we were last year
YOU1000000038_S0000119	we have got 15 girls out here we kind of tried to go with our most athletic girls and just kind of work with it from there but they are very excited coach jackson and i are very excited so it is always cool to have a new program give the kids some more experiences
YOU1000000038_S0000120	she is absolutely right about that think about that what a great experience for these guys i mean they are going into the season they are not going to have too much pressure i mean no one is really expecting them to make a run as far as wind
YOU1000000038_S0000121	but just the fact to be a part of a brand new program to get out there on the court and have a great time with your friends and to learn a new sport and be competitive with it i mean this is something he will be able to say for the rest of love but they are part of the very 1st team there
YOU1000000038_S0000122	and i really i mean i can not imagine what that feeling must be like
YOU1000000038_S0000123	but you should that sounds like us it is like the beginning we started from the beginning i remember when i was a part of a water polo team at my high school that was only in its 2nd year it is all about patience when you are in a startup program and the eagles will learn so much of that this season
YOU1000000038_S0000124	and spencer one of the things they have to also see is being able to build that roster and see who is actually going to be able to perform well on the court
YOU1000000038_S0000125	yeah absolutely moving forward that will be a great test of just what this team is going to have
YOU1000000038_S0000126	alright and so many games on the eastern shore tell us which ones we should go to like our facebook page 47 abc sports and after you do that go follow us on our twitter account at 47 abc sports

YOU1000000038_S0000129	this is monica wheatley for the woodbridge field hockey team and you are watching the delmarva sports inside
YOU1000000038_S0000131	welcome back we are going to talk a little fancy football now guys there is always that one guy that is flying under the radar that can totally change your team gessel who you got this year
YOU1000000038_S0000132	my sleeper pick is actually someone i went to high school with the hilton from the cult wide receiver and he was as impressive with andrew luck he was impressive as andrew luck number one option last season after the injury to procaine reggie wayne
YOU1000000038_S0000133	i mean just look at those stats from last season hilton had 1083 yards and 5 touchdowns he is speedy and sure wayne is coming back this season but i think hilton will put up big numbers this season
YOU1000000038_S0000134	and give me some major points that i need
YOU1000000038_S0000135	yeah well my sleeper i did not go to high school with but i am going with manuel manuel missed 6 games last season with an hyperextended knee but he has got some serious weapons now spiller fred jackson
YOU1000000038_S0000136	they traded in the draft for sammy watkins he is a monster they add robert woods and speedster marquis goodwin and they got mike williams on and there is a lot of weapons there a lot of young weapons but they are very talented he is undrafted in most leagues you know
YOU1000000038_S0000137	so i think you can make a case to be a good sleeper pick i definitely do you can definitely get him latin
YOU1000000038_S0000138	i think there is a big reason why he is undrafted most i am sleeping on manual
YOU1000000038_S0000139	but the guy i am going with i mean tides are always hard to find i think the dairy screen is going to have a big year for the chargers
YOU1000000038_S0000140	i mean he did not exactly have amazing numbers last year i get it just 13 catches and 3 tds but he is starting to take more and more reps with the ones philip rivers loves his tight ends and i think he is going to get a lot of balls thrown his way this year
YOU1000000038_S0000141	you think so
YOU1000000038_S0000142	i think so
YOU1000000038_S0000143	i know
YOU1000000038_S0000144	have you ever had someone let you down
YOU1000000038_S0000145	just when you needed them let us talk about the bus the worst fine football thing that could ever happen is a bus
YOU1000000038_S0000146	who are you guys going with
YOU1000000038_S0000147	drumroll i got ronk i know someone out there also has rob gronkowski as their bus i know this guy is coming off an injury and he is no adrian peterson let us be real the unlucky number here is 14 and know that is not the number of touchdowns
YOU1000000038_S0000148	score that is how many weeks of football he is missed due to injury i understand that he is one of the top tight ends in the league when he was extremely healthy remember extremely healthy scoring 42 touchdowns in 50 career regular season games
YOU1000000038_S0000149	he is also had 8 career surgeries i just do not see the spark in gronkowski how much can you really physically overcome this season the game is just getting even harder
YOU1000000038_S0000150	i do not know any time you got brady i feel like you are going to be all right
YOU1000000038_S0000152	sorry not sorry eagles fans but i am going with nick foals yeah i know what you are saying nick had amazing numbers last season which is exactly why i am staying away from him teams now have film on them and they are preparing for chip kelly is offense
YOU1000000038_S0000153	plus he lost to sean jackson he looked lost when i was up there at eagles camp guys but so did all the other eagles quarterbacks but i am not saying on draft eagle especially camco
YOU1000000038_S0000154	but i do not think is going to put up half the numbers he put up last year
YOU1000000038_S0000155	made a lot of people angry
YOU1000000038_S0000157	definitely going to stay away from though is eric decker i mean this guy is definitely going to cost some people from winning their leagues i get it i mean he had some good numbers in denver but the fact is that offense is ridiculous there
YOU1000000038_S0000158	and a number that you need to know is that guy dropped 30% of his catch a ball i mean he has not got good and he does not have good breakaway speed and i just do not feel like anyone should go near him at all
YOU1000000038_S0000160	next week when we bring in chris russell from espn 980 in dc talk about the redskins and coming up after the break one of our favorite segments crazy catches dives and stops are plays of the week coming up you will not want to miss it

YOU1000000040_S0000002	let us get food hunting
YOU1000000040_S0000003	istanbul has an exciting and vibrant food scene this city is diverse heritage is reflected in its incredible food culture in this 5 part series we are going to show you some delicious local turkish food
YOU1000000040_S0000004	and eat where the locals eat this is our 3rd video of the series and we are hunting down the popular snack of lama jon eating a kabab drenched in browned butter
YOU1000000040_S0000005	and visiting a historic sweet shop for turkey is famous turkish delight you do not want to miss this video get ready for some mouthwatering food
YOU1000000040_S0000006	i am thomas
YOU1000000040_S0000007	i am china and we are chasing a plate
YOU1000000040_S0000008	we hope you are hungry let us
YOU1000000040_S0000010	we are starting our food hunting day over on the asian side of istanbul and the 1st thing we are going to eat is a thing called amazon so lamagna you will often see described as turkish pizza but it is nothing like it
YOU1000000040_S0000011	it has its really own unique identity and it is super delicious
YOU1000000040_S0000013	so this is lama on now i reckon it is called turkish pizza because it is round it is made up of dough and the dog has got some topping on it but it is really different in my opinion
YOU1000000040_S0000014	they take a small lump of dough and they roll that doug out until it is really thin paper thin and then they smeared it with a thin minced mixture of lamb parsley i think there is a little bit of chili on there
YOU1000000040_S0000015	and then they pop it into a really blazing hot wood fired oven now you can see that the dough is just perfectly blistered and then it has got that whole mind minced meat mixture on the top
YOU1000000040_S0000016	but it is so thin that you can see like parts of the dough coming through so the way that it is served is it comes with fresh parsley and some lemon so what you do is you grab some parsley pop it in the middle
YOU1000000040_S0000018	then give a little bit of squeeze of lemon over the top of it and then you take the whole thing and you roll it up so you would not think that the dough is very pliable but it is
YOU1000000040_S0000019	it is like beautifully soft alright let us give this thing a taste
YOU1000000040_S0000021	that is so good it is beautiful the dough is so soft but it has the perfect amount of crispiness it is almost a little bit flowery but in a pleasant way
YOU1000000040_S0000022	and the minced meat mixture the lamb it has got so much flavor and there is just enough on there there is the perfect balance of meat and dog
YOU1000000040_S0000023	this is good my initial bite did not get any of that partly in there so let us go for another one
YOU1000000040_S0000025	that fresh parsley imparts such a beautiful vibrant flavor and then that tiny squeeze and hint of lemon juice as an acidity to that bit 0 man this is so good
YOU1000000040_S0000027	that was a great start to this food hunting day do not let anyone tell you that dish is like a pizza it is nothing like a pizza stands out on its own for its own reasons and it is incredible we are on to find some more food now
YOU1000000040_S0000029	our next stop is taking us down near the coast and how beautiful is the city so i am going to show you some shots of this beautiful coastline before we start eating again
YOU1000000040_S0000031	i am really excited about our next stop we are going to be eating a thing called an and kabob now kabab is like a common term for meat that is fashioned into a skewer and then grilled and this caba is made up of a plate of meat
YOU1000000040_S0000032	tomato sauce creamy yoga and brown butter it looks insane and the restaurant which is just over there
YOU1000000040_S0000033	is owned and operated by the family of the man who created this kebab way back in 1867 so there is a real history
YOU1000000040_S0000034	with this restaurant let us go and eat
YOU1000000040_S0000036	cuba has just been delivered and this is unreal and it is pretty different to what you expect when you get some form of cuba here in turkey so normally there is bread around the outside but in this case there is a little bit of bread hiding underneath
YOU1000000040_S0000037	but it is all about the meat so all of this lamb is just piled on top and then to go with it a ginormous dollop of yoga
YOU1000000040_S0000038	some grilled chili peppers and then some fresh tomato and on top of that meat is browned butter so that is going to just make it super rich and creamy so they bring over the big pan of browned butter
YOU1000000040_S0000039	and pour it all over the meat and you can actually see the tomato sauce that shena mentioned as well so you can see the slight orange color in there and then look at the butter just glistening on that meat so
YOU1000000040_S0000040	let us just grab some meat get some bread from under there as well a whole lot of yoga and get right on in
YOU1000000040_S0000042	
YOU1000000040_S0000044	wow that is google
YOU1000000040_S0000045	wow the meat is so soft it is not being charged right down so it does not have like the crunchy bits you often get with this type of meat it is just really soft
YOU1000000040_S0000046	it is quite salty it has got a beautiful salty
YOU1000000040_S0000048	that butter just sort of coat your mouth i was expecting maybe it to be a little bit buttery little bit oily on the top of my mouth
YOU1000000040_S0000049	not at all it is super rich and juicy i am going to get some more but this time i just want a couple of bits of meat so i do not want the yoga or the bread the yoga flavor was very strong so the sourness of the yoga
YOU1000000040_S0000050	i think overtook from the meat flavor of it
YOU1000000040_S0000052	0 yeah that is good
YOU1000000040_S0000054	the butter flavor really really came home that time so it has got quite a sweetness which i guess is coming from that tomato sauce is really good
YOU1000000040_S0000055	i am going to make up a mouthful here with the flat bread the lamb and also some chili pepper and the bread has gone quite soft because of that tomato sauce and the butter and then that yoga in there
YOU1000000040_S0000057	it is really good it is very rich from that butter cream from that yoga but then you can really taste the flavor of the meat that is delicious and we are also washing it down with
YOU1000000040_S0000058	drink called shuda and it is a slightly fermented grape juice sweetened grape juice and this is sort of the traditional accompaniments
YOU1000000040_S0000060	cold sweet refreshing a tiny little bit bubbly perfect thing to go with
YOU1000000040_S0000062	look how all that butter is just sitting in the bottom of the plate now so i am going to grab some more meat and really soggy bread get it right through that butter super oily
YOU1000000040_S0000064	now i can really taste the butter in my 1st bite i could taste the butter but it was not a big favor that is a super bold flavor
YOU1000000040_S0000065	really rich creamy and super oily so there is oil from the meat the tomato sauce and from the butter so you are getting this combination of different illness down there
YOU1000000040_S0000066	and it works a treat just going into this play is really really
YOU1000000040_S0000068	no day in istanbul is complete without a ferry ride or 2 so now we are catching the fairy from the asian side back over to europe where we are going to continue our food hunt
YOU1000000040_S0000070	we have made it back to the european side of istanbul and next up we are going to have an absolute classic snack here in turkey and that is turkish delight now you will see this stuff piled up all over the city in the windows of shops
YOU1000000040_S0000071	massive piles of colorful turkish light but we are not going to one of those places we are going to go to this really traditional place here that has been around since 1926 you will not see those vivid colors here from food coloring
YOU1000000040_S0000072	it is all natural and this stuff is really really good let us go grab
YOU1000000040_S0000074	were loaded up with our bags of turkish delight i wanted to stay in that sweet shop forever it had such a beautiful old world feel about it and the staff was so friendly they had these gorgeous huge candy jars
YOU1000000040_S0000075	filled with sweets tons of turkish delight and they even had big pots of homemade jam you can take your own jam jars
YOU1000000040_S0000077	fill it up it was a beautiful spot we are now going to head off and find ourselves a turkish coffee to wash these babies down
YOU1000000040_S0000079	it is a holiday here in istanbul today so the coffee place we wanted to go to is sadly shut it is known as one of the best places to get a turkish coffee here in istanbul so that is why we wanted to go to that particular place
YOU1000000040_S0000080	so with scrap the coffee idea we are going to do the next best thing here in turkey and that is tea they have these brilliant little streetside cafes just little mini cafes right on the footpath we are going to grab a tea there
YOU1000000040_S0000082	we have set ourselves down at a small table at this tea cafe ordered up a couple of glasses of turkish tea and we are going to crack into this turkish delight
YOU1000000040_S0000083	so turkish delight in turkish is local and if you have never had like before it is like a jelly like sweet almost like a gummy and it is made out of corn flour and water and sugar
YOU1000000040_S0000084	and then they dust it with icing sugar once it is cool and we ordered rose pistachio and mint flavor and we have had this before and we know that it is amazing so i have got the pistachio here
YOU1000000040_S0000086	it is beautiful the flavor of the pistachios is really strong so really earthy flavor and the pistachios still have a bit of crunch the
YOU1000000040_S0000088	soft they are quite crunchy and then the texture of the turkish delight the loom is really sort of a little bit sticky tiny bit chilly but very soft and it is very sweet
YOU1000000040_S0000089	so this tea is going to go perfectly with that so they like to serve their tea with sugar the turks so i am going to pop the 2 sugars in because i find that the tea can be quite strong
YOU1000000040_S0000090	and quite bitter so we will just give that a bit of a star
YOU1000000040_S0000092	alright let us have a sip of this tie or tea
YOU1000000040_S0000094	0 yeah that is really good it is very strong quite bitter and i do not know if thomas mentioned but drinking tea is like a national pastime in turkey people stop and have a cup of tea like all throughout the day right from the early morning right through
YOU1000000040_S0000095	the evening late late at night and both of us have really gotten into this pastime it is really nice to just take a moment out of your day sit watch the world go by sip your tea
YOU1000000040_S0000096	and this is a perfect combination so you have got the really sweet turkish delight and then the bitter tea to wash it down
YOU1000000040_S0000098	i am going to grab a piece of mint turkish delight and this is my favorite flavor for turkish delight by a long way i have got great memories of turkish delight as a young boy eating it because it was a bit of a treat in my family both my parents
YOU1000000040_S0000099	and my aunt and uncle came to istanbul in the 70 s they got a taste for turkish delight back then so it was always the treat thing we had on our family dinner table for after a meal so let us try this
YOU1000000040_S0000101	delicious flavor just builds you know when it is natural mint flavor because it comes on slowly and like shena said we have had this turkish delight before and i know that this mint flavor just
YOU1000000040_S0000102	evolves and evolves and even 10 minutes later it is still in your mouth incredibly strong that is a beautiful beautiful flavor and i love that it is not bright green like i talked about before
YOU1000000040_S0000103	when you see turkish light in the shops on the main road the strips bright green bright pinks for the rose one these are not like that at all they are just very subtly colored little flecks of mint in the mint one
YOU1000000040_S0000104	and the taste is absolutely incredible so if you are here in istanbul you have definitely got to have a taste of turkish delight and make sure you get it from this place or one of the few places like this one but this place does an incredible version of turkish delight
YOU1000000040_S0000105	really good
YOU1000000040_S0000107	another great day of eating here in istanbul and we are finishing with one of the turkish delight places behind us that i have talked about a couple of times so the colorful stuff piled up on
YOU1000000040_S0000108	the tree straps so do not go to one of those go to where we did this place is incredible for food

YOU1000000044_S0000018	because bottle caps has told me that i should shave my beard and i would look 20 years younger so and i was telling him i have a wife who thoroughly enjoys this beard

YOU1000000044_S0000025	i had most of my life actually got i recently just shaved my head full winter beard you as a fellow canadian understand that for the winter months
YOU1000000044_S0000026	but i always had some sort of facial hair except for 2 years 2 or 3 years i guess when i worked in saskatchewan halling crude oil
YOU1000000044_S0000027	because of the fire restrictions to be able to wear a mask in case of emergency you are not allowed to have any facial hair except for a mustache so
YOU1000000044_S0000028	yes i am forgetting is reminding me about the about the camera because i am used to having it on my computer and now it is between the both of us
YOU1000000044_S0000029	so i always had a clean shaven face during that time and it was probably one of the more depressing parts of my life i liked my job but i just never felt like me
YOU1000000044_S0000030	so it is it was one of the 1st things i did as soon as i stopped working at that and we moved back to montreal was to grow my facial hair again i do not think i have ever gone without it since
YOU1000000044_S0000031	yeah maybe once or twice
YOU1000000044_S0000032	after a but shave job i would just shave and start over again but it was very temporarily
YOU1000000044_S0000033	yeah so funny that actually before we went to saskatchewan you have long hair
YOU1000000044_S0000034	very long
YOU1000000044_S0000035	long hair and before before that he had very long hair like you can not even see how long it was yeah
YOU1000000044_S0000036	that was a different time
YOU1000000044_S0000037	so yeah has gone through different phases but i love her i do not know
YOU1000000044_S0000038	i do not know just something about it just like it i mean i like it when you shave it off too but it is just some that forest caveman saying something going
YOU1000000044_S0000039	signia does have a thing for the camera
YOU1000000044_S0000040	viking caveman mix i would say i guess
YOU1000000044_S0000041	yeah and the funny part is we had a viking wedding and i think that is one of the shortest my facial hair and beard and hair actually ever was
YOU1000000044_S0000042	i think so yeah yeah you a little bit shaped on the side yeah something like that but i love the way he is right now that that is my favorite

YOU1000000044_S0000145	we are doing another one this week like i said i want to start we are going to still keep doing videos but we want to have kind of a photograph series as well
YOU1000000044_S0000146	i am just we are the next one we are going to be doing is here i want to bring this up is jungfrau which is the highest point in europe
YOU1000000044_S0000147	i just put up a wiki page right here just so you can take a quick look at it and this is the highest point actually in europe and you go by train
YOU1000000044_S0000148	and the train climbs up to about 3 quarters of the top and from there you switch over to another train cogwheel of course
YOU1000000044_S0000149	which takes you right to the very top the last part going through is a tunnel through one of the peaks and when you arrive at the top you are at lico point that is 11371 feet
YOU1000000044_S0000151	it is amazing i was in switzerland and was tired from my trip and almost did not go and thank you to my lovely wife who convinced me that i was crazy to be there and not go through with it
YOU1000000044_S0000152	was probably one of the most amazing places i had ever seen in my life
YOU1000000044_S0000153	so that will be the next one that is coming up i am probably looking at i do not know maybe monday at this point i guess would be the
YOU1000000044_S0000154	well definitely next week

YOU1000000044_S0000156	it is a shame that they are really not a shame i mean they are being on instagram places but also did not take advantage of youtube as well

YOU1000000044_S0000287	actually like trying to do the live streams in between them as well and that is a good day for uploading videos so we will mix and match them up some
YOU1000000044_S0000288	hancock no twitter
YOU1000000044_S0000289	
YOU1000000044_S0000291	larry i am a fisherman too we have got lots of fishermen in here
YOU1000000044_S0000293	brother done do you have facebook
YOU1000000044_S0000295	anything that we can message you
YOU1000000044_S0000296	yeah it is just to send you a link and that is all you will have to do is click on the link and you will be hooked up i have been on youtube for 4 years and now going on 5 since january
YOU1000000044_S0000297	13th 2015 wow so you have definitely been around for a while relations
YOU1000000044_S0000299	bottle caps if you watch my last video i made and there is no editing cuts in it
YOU1000000044_S0000300	better than to hold somebody is attention on a fast editing
YOU1000000044_S0000301	something cuts in which is better to hold somebody is attention
YOU1000000044_S0000302	lots of fast or something just smooth
YOU1000000044_S0000303	okay the question into it it really depends what the message is you want to tell
YOU1000000044_S0000304	i mean yeah i do some very fast editing but i also if you take my 16 again for a day videos are a lot of them where i grew up in the gas
YOU1000000044_S0000305	
YOU1000000044_S0000307	they are not very fast and they should not because it will absolutely destroy the mood you do a lot of outdoor scenery
YOU1000000044_S0000308	and it also depends on your music too what you want to do my last one i did with the european countries i mean they are they are very slow panning
YOU1000000044_S0000309	but you will notice when it gets to croatia it goes and turns the side well that is a white flash i put in and then i rotated i forget now maybe 25 degrees
YOU1000000044_S0000310	but that is just for transformation to follow with the beat yeah smooth is great lots of people that is it depends what you want what kind of a story you want to tell
YOU1000000044_S0000311	it is amazing how you can take one piece of footage grab 10 different tracks of different genres different tempos
YOU1000000044_S0000312	and completely tell a story that would have made would have you would have never even guessed of making just by following the beat
YOU1000000044_S0000313	and also to it depends on the editor what they are comfortable with i mean some people it is like guitar players when i was in bands
YOU1000000044_S0000314	there is some guys whether the song was 10 beats a minute i know that is extreme just for the point of conversation
YOU1000000044_S0000315	or 200 beats a minute they play the same wiry fast screaming solo over to it
YOU1000000044_S0000316	and for me it just did not make any sense but to them that is just what they wanted to do so
YOU1000000044_S0000318	but i find for what you do your type of videos and the type of music you go with smoother is definitely speaks more of what you do and they look great
YOU1000000044_S0000320	don says that he has facebook done if you can just go over to our facebook pushes studios that one
YOU1000000044_S0000321	yeah we do

YOU1000000044_S0000399	ok so hello and heavens we feel weird about putting our own video on the creator playlist
YOU1000000044_S0000400	the thing that you should
YOU1000000044_S0000401	put your own and then put somebody else is
YOU1000000044_S0000402	the best practice i think was 2 videos now yeah yeah
YOU1000000044_S0000403	2 videos that you think are going to be good for catching attention and letting people know what you are about
YOU1000000044_S0000404	put it on it is like advertising it is free advertising you do not want to be shy advertising you want to be advertising

YOU1000000044_S0000474	but i am originally from latvia which is the baltic states in northern eastern europe
YOU1000000044_S0000476	so a little bit of european and a little bit of canadian based in montreal
YOU1000000044_S0000477	right a good mix
YOU1000000044_S0000478	yeah great
YOU1000000044_S0000479	yeah exactly
YOU1000000044_S0000480	a shadow to that role they are 3 away from 550
YOU1000000044_S0000481	
YOU1000000044_S0000482	anybody have not subscribed yet please go over that is how i roll
YOU1000000044_S0000483	we showed this last night just to show you where one is from originally
YOU1000000044_S0000484	excuse me so this is a map of europe of course and there is latvia and that is the capital riga where she was raised
YOU1000000044_S0000485	and push the town that we named our business after
YOU1000000044_S0000486	now we laughed last night because i did get it it is tricky to find it is a small little town there is prusha
YOU1000000044_S0000487	and this is this is the town that we named our business after because that is where her mom grew up
YOU1000000044_S0000488	it is roughly about 45 kilometers from the russian border beautiful place i absolutely adore it there
YOU1000000044_S0000489	let us see if i can find
YOU1000000044_S0000491	kind of tricky to show pictures i got it last night for the road but it is very white on my screen because of the lights so i might not be able to see it
YOU1000000044_S0000492	but we will give it a try anyways here we will just do one on the road here
YOU1000000044_S0000494	i got that in my way so i am just going to bring this up a little bit bear with me
YOU1000000044_S0000496	close this and all my youtube advertisements are getting in the way that is okay
YOU1000000044_S0000497	just
YOU1000000044_S0000499	that is a bit of the scenery and it is gorgeous over there we do still have some property over there
YOU1000000044_S0000500	in just up this road we can go for a little walk drive youtube google drive if you want to call it that
YOU1000000044_S0000501	as you can see it reminds me a lot of some of the people here that are from canada may be familiar it reminds me a bit of new brunswick except it is mostly pine trees instead of spruce
YOU1000000044_S0000503	but a lot of the same kind of rolling rolling hills not very mountainous
YOU1000000044_S0000504	though there is only one mountain literally 300 meters high
YOU1000000044_S0000506	but still an amazing amazingly beautiful place i think i found it
YOU1000000044_S0000508	go in
YOU1000000044_S0000510	over here
YOU1000000044_S0000512	and this is the her mom is family home and right over here this is the new house they are building in front actually but it was right at this spot
YOU1000000044_S0000514	yeah no it is a beautiful place not a lot of travelers i kind of stand out when i am there
YOU1000000044_S0000515	latvians a very very hard language to speak there is only 170 people around in the world i believe 20 that speak
YOU1000000044_S0000516	
YOU1000000044_S0000517	it is considered an endangered language i was learning russian because of course as an ex soviet country you can get by with russian in most places
YOU1000000044_S0000518	there is from the side and here is where the stork is that i always like to see when we go over to the stork is nest
YOU1000000044_S0000519	which is cool because almost every house does have a nest and the thing is like the size of a 45 gallon drum
YOU1000000044_S0000520	but we actually stay in the new house when we were visiting the last time and a stark landed on the roof and they were all excited and said that is a sign of good luck
YOU1000000044_S0000521	it means that the who is ever in the house was probably going to have a child we already have 3 so i informed my wife there was no way i was staying in the house that night
YOU1000000044_S0000522	so
YOU1000000044_S0000523	honestly say it is enough
YOU1000000044_S0000524	yeah yeah we have we have done our part so
YOU1000000044_S0000525	steve says that he uses google earth all the time they love it
YOU1000000044_S0000526	there is a game i always play well i play it for a week and then i get too obsessed with it and have to back off for a bit
YOU1000000044_S0000527	and it is called gogo guesser
YOU1000000044_S0000529	and it is google maps but you can pick like either the european union or the united states canada there is tons of maps that are already made
YOU1000000044_S0000530	and it drops you off in the middle of nowhere and you have to guess where you are
YOU1000000044_S0000531	and you can walk as i was just doing a minute ago through it but you cannot zoom out enough to see which country you are into you can only see where you are at
YOU1000000044_S0000532	and it is really cool like i love doing the europe one cause you got to guess by the language on the signs trucks passing
YOU1000000044_S0000533	and then you you the points are determined you start off with 5000
YOU1000000044_S0000534	and they start deducting for a point i believe it works for every kilometer that you are away from the exact point
YOU1000000044_S0000535	and it is not like you just pick the country you have got to pick the area where you are into but anybody who loves google maps it really makes it a lot funnier
YOU1000000044_S0000536	something to look into is and this is where i am from well
YOU1000000044_S0000537	here is montreal here and i am from what they call the gap and this is like that thumb that sticks out from quebec over top of new brunswick and of course man in the lower side
YOU1000000044_S0000538	and above it is where the saint lawrence seaway comes in into the great lakes
YOU1000000044_S0000540	there i got it i got it when you went up to do the plus you okay okay i see what happened when you went to add probably because the mic is right beside it
YOU1000000044_S0000541

YOU1000000044_S0000558	most definitely very entertaining the people are great sports that she picks up i think it is one of your favorite channels i would say
YOU1000000044_S0000559	0 yes my god yeah i sing along literally sing along
YOU1000000044_S0000560	this is true she is not making this up i have heard her so i can vote for
YOU1000000044_S0000561	yeah that is true moerman is from edmonston
YOU1000000044_S0000562	edmonston when we travel home we always go by new brunswick that is why i was curious and we always go by edmonston
YOU1000000044_S0000563	along the 185 and then into which is number 2 i believe it is if i am not mistaken so amazing to have you here that is great
YOU1000000044_S0000565	
YOU1000000044_S0000567	one of the big land one of the big attractions on the gaba because it is a small town it is all coastal fishing communities mostly
YOU1000000044_S0000569	this is one of the most famous of the place and this usually represents the province of quebec a lot of times
YOU1000000044_S0000570	when they do different visuals from all the provinces and it is called percy rock
YOU1000000044_S0000571	and it is this rock that literally was the figure moved about 80 kilometers during the ice age you can see in proportion to the buildings here
YOU1000000044_S0000573	it is one of the most beautifully beautiful places and it is heavily photographed
YOU1000000044_S0000574	ancient you feel like you have just traveled back in time every time you see it it is incredible
YOU1000000044_S0000575	just looking to see there is any other really great pictures of it and there is a hole in the rock of course
YOU1000000044_S0000576	which there is a small ferry that ferry tourist boats that drive right through the hole
YOU1000000044_S0000577	and the piece that is beside it was once connected but over time has fallen apart and eventually that is what will happen of course to the other one as well
YOU1000000044_S0000578	there is a huge bird sanctuary there you can just see the corner of it right here called bonaventure island
YOU1000000044_S0000579	and it is monitored by i believe it is mcgill university from montreal
YOU1000000044_S0000580	another perspective of it from the back side just to show you the size of it it is colossal
YOU1000000044_S0000582	but it is definitely a place that if you are ever looking for somewhere off the beaten path
YOU1000000044_S0000583	it is friendly it is all that you can do the constable you can easily do it in a day but you would drive yourself crazy
YOU1000000044_S0000584	to really visit it you give yourself 34 days and you will see varied
YOU1000000044_S0000586	very terrain it is almost like traveling through 3 different countries i would say almost i would
YOU1000000044_S0000587	
YOU1000000044_S0000588	you know because they do not have any in common the north side has some of the oldest rocks in the world black worn down
YOU1000000044_S0000589	but an amazing feeling as the saint lawrence seaway comes in on the lower side here is a lot more closer to red rock that you would find for instance in prince edward island
YOU1000000044_S0000590	but not as red as theirs so it is not so oxidized
YOU1000000044_S0000591	and then where i would live for instance you come to the park following that river which is nothing but trees and some of the highest mountains in quebec
YOU1000000044_S0000592	which of course are the are all part of the operations that run all the way down through the south of the united states
YOU1000000044_S0000593	we are all connected yeah so there is just some of the photos from it there is some from the island the bird sanctuary
YOU1000000044_S0000595	can you go check the microphone again please
YOU1000000044_S0000596	again

YOU1000000044_S0000646	
YOU1000000044_S0000647	yeah and latiolais above its coastal country for the baltic sea right across from sweden

YOU1000000044_S0000649	yeah well roughly across from sweden i guess bit of an angle but yeah you go through poland and then to lithuania and then to latvia
YOU1000000044_S0000650	lithuania latvia and estonia is referred to as the baltic states
YOU1000000044_S0000651	i have heard of all that yes
YOU1000000044_S0000652	so yep
YOU1000000044_S0000653	i must say for a person who has been through europe what what did you say was 12 countries in 15 days or was it 15 countries in 12
YOU1000000044_S0000654	12 and 15 yeah

YOU1000000044_S0000668	
YOU1000000044_S0000669	i would like to go to florence because i mean in my history class that was of course where the renaissance began

YOU1000000044_S0000677	i have a camcorder and i have to clean the dust off the lens like regularly
YOU1000000044_S0000678	you deserve the clearest picture possible
YOU1000000044_S0000679	0 man that is that is beautiful i love that and it kind of reminds me of venice almost
YOU1000000044_S0000680	i know that is probably not not actually venus but it looks similar when you think about it
YOU1000000044_S0000682	there so other people can see
YOU1000000044_S0000683	whoa okay
YOU1000000044_S0000684	i can see it clearly
YOU1000000044_S0000686	actually let me go on your stream because i think what they may be seeing right now is i think i think the bedroom at my grandmother is house
YOU1000000044_S0000688	never mind it is coming in clear it is coming in clear okay now now it is showing my face okay that is a bit of an issue when you think about it
YOU1000000044_S0000690	no the other year we were talking last night though pictures behind me we have a picture from every country that i visited
YOU1000000044_S0000691	and some of us to come together and some of my own
YOU1000000044_S0000692	but the ones behind me there is the 12 of them that was my 1st ever time i traveled for 2 weeks mostly by train across europe
YOU1000000044_S0000693	wow
YOU1000000044_S0000695	train it
YOU1000000044_S0000696	i have never traveled the country by train i have been on plenty of scenic railroads and whatnot but i have never been on a legit cross country passenger train run
YOU1000000044_S0000697	always wanted to do that i know canada has some very beautiful scenery and they still use vintage passenger equipment i think from the 50 s and 60 s
YOU1000000044_S0000698	some of them yeah they have been monitored monitored monitored modified modernizing thank you
YOU1000000044_S0000699	but yeah they do still have some of the engines still running in that and there is also the more expensive one maybe bottle caps can help me with the name of it
YOU1000000044_S0000700	that i think it is the canadian i know that is one of the trains that still uses the vintage passenger car fleet
YOU1000000044_S0000701	yeah but that is still part of the real one but there is another privatized one and it runs from calgary to vancouver
YOU1000000044_S0000702	
YOU1000000044_S0000703	it stops at all the fairmont hotel like all the the 5 star hotels every night and
YOU1000000044_S0000704	i know the canadian actually
YOU1000000044_S0000705	i know they stopped i think at a few of the chateaus that were built by the canadian pacific i could be wrong i could be wrong
YOU1000000044_S0000706	
YOU1000000044_S0000708	but yeah i did like i said in the stream chat i have been wanting to try and do an interview about my channel for a while now
YOU1000000044_S0000709	i actually tried to do 2 self interviews that i really do not think they were very good in my opinion
YOU1000000044_S0000710	this is this is an honor for me okay keep that in mind
YOU1000000044_S0000711	0 my god well it is an honor for us to have you here you are
YOU1000000044_S0000712	thanks you
YOU1000000044_S0000713	we are still getting our legs if you will for this so it is a learning
YOU1000000044_S0000714	this is a good start
YOU1000000044_S0000715	well it is it is and there is lots of great people i mean this community is very supportive and that is what really means a lot did you join the community i am a creator community
YOU1000000044_S0000716	no i do not think i did is there a possibility i could send the link to that in the hangout chat
YOU1000000044_S0000717	yeah after the stream set you up
YOU1000000044_S0000719	
YOU1000000044_S0000720	great place that is where a lot of us that are here have met each other i am looking through the list here and that is a lot of them came from there and it is a great place to network with other people
YOU1000000044_S0000721	also here i am going to send you guys the link to my stream because
YOU1000000044_S0000722	i included as channel in the in the description for the stream right now it is still live for me
YOU1000000044_S0000723	
YOU1000000044_S0000724	and it is at the very bottom of the list my apologies no problem sometimes i include channel here or there that even though it is not in the stream i figured it is too good not to include
YOU1000000044_S0000725	right
YOU1000000044_S0000726	when i saw as wendy is video filmed the wind turbine train i still think it is very well done
YOU1000000044_S0000727	thank you
YOU1000000044_S0000728	that is what got me interested in yale is channel and i must say yale is work is truly phenomenal it is some of the most incredible video work i have seen
YOU1000000044_S0000729	thank you i appreciate that you are too kind
YOU1000000044_S0000730	it is that is that train was filmed in the case where i grew up where i showed in the map a while ago
YOU1000000044_S0000731	and we were home on vacation and how the train things started was i always like trains but i wanted something i could do with my my middle age
YOU1000000044_S0000732	because i have 3 children we have 3 children excuse me and my middle one is now 11 he was 10 at the time and i just wanted something i could do with him
YOU1000000044_S0000733	and i wanted to keep shooting stuff it is hard with video because it is hard to find things that are interesting sometimes
YOU1000000044_S0000734	and that is when i finally decided to try the trains with him so he would come out with me all the time and
YOU1000000044_S0000735	he was a good supporter we all get into it he gets you know he gets to know it it is a good way to spend time together
YOU1000000044_S0000736	so long story short we were in the gas bay and the nice thing about that train is that up until a couple years ago it was an active railway was going through there
YOU1000000044_S0000737	prior to that was the cn they had already privatized the freight but then there was a problem with one of the tressels and therefore they shut down all passenger
YOU1000000044_S0000738	so now you have to go to the town of new brunswick hamilton hamilton in the province of new brunswick just to be able to get a passenger train which is an hour away from where i live
YOU1000000044_S0000739	ouch
YOU1000000044_S0000740	but since they started building these windmills they actually have to track them from the coast about 200 kilometers to that point then they load them on these train cars
YOU1000000044_S0000741	and from there yeah so the the maximum they are allowed is 72 cars because well for canada you are allowed a maximum of 2 kilometer rail
YOU1000000044_S0000742	because that is the longest spur that they have if it has to go off the tracks
YOU1000000044_S0000743	and they they publicize it you can go on their website and they show you exactly when the train is leaving the full schedules
YOU1000000044_S0000744	i have actually never caught a turbine train before i have never caught one
YOU1000000044_S0000745	
YOU1000000044_S0000746	i did not even see the railroad line here in the u s norfolk southern has a program
YOU1000000044_S0000747	where they paint some of their locomotives into the railroad paint schemes of railroads that they either merged or just simply no longer exist
YOU1000000044_S0000748	right
YOU1000000044_S0000749	for instance when i was in altona pennsylvania i actually caught the 1st what we find her call heritage unit
YOU1000000044_S0000750	
YOU1000000044_S0000751	in altona and it was the pennsylvania heritage unit
YOU1000000044_S0000752	and i kind of found that a perfect one to catch because the track that is going through our tuna formerly was owned and run by the pennsylvania railroad
YOU1000000044_S0000753	wow that is interesting
YOU1000000044_S0000755	that is very cool yeah you you do a lot into the digging behind the scenes that is what i like about what you do actually
YOU1000000044_S0000756	thank you i will tell you i am into trains i have been into them since i was 2 years old but that is not the only thing that i do on my channel
YOU1000000044_S0000757	this livestreaming i have only gotten into recently i actually was only started it on my birthday that is really when i 1st got started with this
YOU1000000044_S0000758	it is sort of been getting more of the attention on my channel ever since
YOU1000000044_S0000760	really do not know
YOU1000000044_S0000762	it is a great way of getting the view time
YOU1000000044_S0000763	definitely there is nothing wrong with that i mean we are all here to grow and and and it is nice to find new ways it is like
YOU1000000044_S0000764	as if a painter started painting and then only did the same type of style the rest of their life
YOU1000000044_S0000765	that is true
YOU1000000044_S0000766	everybody collaborated with another youtuber before recently his name is jesse juett
YOU1000000044_S0000767	he does he is a gaming trooper he he does videos on a game called roblox
YOU1000000044_S0000768	
YOU1000000044_S0000769	i do not know if you have heard of it but he and i have done almost 34 videos together now
YOU1000000044_S0000770	wow good
YOU1000000044_S0000771	what you know teenagers my age call me i will i will admit they are hilarious some of them are related to me
YOU1000000044_S0000772	some of them i asked him to make 0 my god i tell you i find them funny i do not know if anyone else would but yeah
YOU1000000044_S0000773	i will i will send you guys a link to his channel right quick let me see if i can pull it up here preserve 2000
YOU1000000044_S0000774	see here
YOU1000000044_S0000775	our kids actually playing playing block
YOU1000000044_S0000777	probably too much
YOU1000000044_S0000779	the problem nowadays people my age and younger are just getting more and more addicted into games
YOU1000000044_S0000780	it is okay as long as you have other hobbies like you have this and stuff
YOU1000000044_S0000781	that is true
YOU1000000044_S0000782	it is all about balance
YOU1000000044_S0000784	yes that is true let me see here i know i have a list of channels here let me see here
YOU1000000044_S0000785	so i wanted to ask you you did a trip to alaska did not you
YOU1000000044_S0000786	yes that was that trip had a lot of firsts if you will that was the 1st time i had been on a jet
YOU1000000044_S0000787	1st time i have been to seattle washington 1st time i had been on a cruise ship 1st time i have been to alaska in general 1st time i went to canada
YOU1000000044_S0000788	1st time i seen a glacier yeah there there was a lot of firsts and i had actually hoped when i was there i would hoped to see or wales
YOU1000000044_S0000789	would have made a sort of vow to only see whales in the wild and i had never never got a chance to see them in alaska never did
YOU1000000044_S0000790	well that is great because it means you have got another reason to go back
YOU1000000044_S0000791	true but it was my grandmother who was able to make the trip possible and i had waited 13 years to go to alaska 13 years
YOU1000000044_S0000792	2003 to 2016 and it was mainly due to a film my grandmother brought back on her trip to alaska back in 2003
YOU1000000044_S0000793	about a railroad that is in skagway alaska it is called the white pass and can route
YOU1000000044_S0000794	
YOU1000000044_S0000795	and it has been in use since 1898 and it did not shut down normal revenue service until 1982
YOU1000000044_S0000796	okay and it only stayed closed for 5 years and it reopened into the current operation it does now which is excursion trains in 1988
YOU1000000044_S0000797	and after she brought the documentary back in 2003
YOU1000000044_S0000798	let us just say in her own words once i sat down and watched it i never moved i was enthralled by it
YOU1000000044_S0000799	and she told me the next time she went back she would take me with her and i waited of course like i said 13 years
YOU1000000044_S0000800	i finally got to see the railroad for myself and ride it in 2016 and i have video footage of it now
YOU1000000044_S0000802	a lot of my film i am still trying to improve on one of the videos are currently edited i will admit that there is there is a lot of stuff i am still trying to work on with my channel
YOU1000000044_S0000803	
YOU1000000044_S0000805	but i mean i kind of like it that my videos are edited
YOU1000000044_S0000806	because a lot of the time not many youtubers really upload unedited footage anymore and i like to show what normal youtubers really just decided to leave out that is what i like to do
YOU1000000044_S0000807	right everybody has got to find their own way to express themselves onto it i agree
YOU1000000044_S0000808	talk with bottle caps tonight about that that is exactly what it is everybody has got to find their own way that they feel comfortable and spreading sending their message
YOU1000000044_S0000809	that is true
YOU1000000044_S0000810	look at musicians we can like take the same song same lyrics and give it to 20 different musicians they are all going to come up with a different way of expressing
YOU1000000044_S0000812	same with the music i mean i have always sometimes i have always said that i feel like i was just born in the wrong time because when you think about it
YOU1000000044_S0000813	if you have seen my videos i mean especially one i did at kettle creek battlefield and here near
YOU1000000044_S0000814	it is a revolutionary war battlefield 7 miles from washington georgia where i live i live in athens but you know the battlefield 7 miles from washington but
YOU1000000044_S0000815	in the video i make a point to mention that i have a deep respect for war veterans a very deep respect for them
YOU1000000044_S0000816	
YOU1000000044_S0000817	i mean just think about it just what they have gone through alone you know you know they need they do not need i do not like it when they are forgotten
YOU1000000044_S0000818	
YOU1000000044_S0000819	and they deserve to be remembered especially for what all they did
YOU1000000044_S0000821	and i have a very deep respect for people who have come before my time
YOU1000000044_S0000822	for a lot of the historical you know events that have happened before my time all of that
YOU1000000044_S0000823	but what interests me most is you know a lot of the things that were around before my time you know a lot of the antiques and whatnot i find that very interesting
YOU1000000044_S0000824	how many people in my generation really care about that stuff
YOU1000000044_S0000825	not many you are right very true very true
YOU1000000044_S0000826	that is true and it is a shame it is so it is great to have somebody like you that might inspire some of them to go and take a 2nd look at it so
YOU1000000044_S0000827	rainman would like a shoutout of course train man you can have a shoutout you can join the panel if you like i would always love to have you and if you do not feel like it tonight some other night

YOU1000000044_S0000879	i tell you my parents have actually told me i am pretty much one who is unforgettable and i think they are right
YOU1000000044_S0000880	i recently went to a rail line in west virginia it is called the cassoni railroad which is really worth checking out by the way
YOU1000000044_S0000881	and i actually befriended one of the guys who works on the train his name is josh and when i met him for the 1st time he was actually a commentator slash brakeman
YOU1000000044_S0000882	and i did not afterwards i ended up leaving cast to go back to georgia once our trip there ended and
YOU1000000044_S0000883	i did not go back for 2 years and when i recently made a return trip which is heavily documented on my channel
YOU1000000044_S0000884	now it was also on the same trip where i went to niagara falls okay in ontario canada
YOU1000000044_S0000886	you know saw him and i said hey man you remember me and he was like
YOU1000000044_S0000887	he remembered me after 2 years of not seeing me he remembered who i was
YOU1000000044_S0000888	that is amazing
YOU1000000044_S0000889	that is that and it is the same with my mom with my dad is mother too when she went i think it was either hong kong or beijing she went there like 3 times
YOU1000000044_S0000890	there was a street vendor who remembered her and she had not even been back in i think 3 years at one point
YOU1000000044_S0000892	wow yeah well some people are just more memorable sounds like your them
YOU1000000044_S0000893	it depends on the character
YOU1000000044_S0000894	you know stand out so that is what you want to do in life that is what you need for youtube so that is all good traits so
YOU1000000044_S0000895	i mean there is a few reasons i made the channel one the 1st reason originally was i wanted i made it
YOU1000000044_S0000897	you know in 2015 but this was when i had just started getting into filming and at this point i had a computer
YOU1000000044_S0000898	that you know really did not work too well i always had a hard drive 5 or 10 minutes in a sense
YOU1000000044_S0000899	and i lost everything on on a really sporadic basis and it was annoying okay it was very annoying
YOU1000000044_S0000900	and the computer i have now which is a toshiba app i have had it for almost i think 2 or 3 years now
YOU1000000044_S0000901	it is proven itself to be a very good computer it is only had one hard drive crash and it is not had a crash since knock on wood
YOU1000000044_S0000902	good knock on wood for sure

YOU1000000044_S0000905	yeah i made the channel so i would have a place to put my videos in case my computer crashed again i would not lose them
YOU1000000044_S0000906	i never really thought anybody would view them or watch them i did not even know if i would get any subscribers
YOU1000000044_S0000907	keep in mind the footage is still there but it is nearly 4 years old and in my opinion now it is like really bad okay
YOU1000000044_S0000908	i have even labeled one of my playlists which is when i filmed in folkstone is in parentheses
YOU1000000044_S0000909	well bad film if you will because it can not be watched okay i was really inexperienced when i filmed that let me tell you
YOU1000000044_S0000910	well that is we all learn we all start somewhere and we look back at our own work but i mean that is all part of the process
YOU1000000044_S0000911	and a lot of times it is making a good thing out of something that did not quite work out the way we were hoping
YOU1000000044_S0000912	
YOU1000000044_S0000913	a video of you ever seen it called montreal sloma and the reason why is i recorded it by accident out of my car

YOU1000000044_S0000956	i had a lot of save playlists which referred to either music or video video playlist to my interest
YOU1000000044_S0000957	
YOU1000000044_S0000958	and i sort of organize them there is music from films i remember watching when i was younger up to the present
YOU1000000044_S0000959	there is documentaries i found on youtube and sort of an extensive sort of archived here on my channel
YOU1000000044_S0000961	there is gaming videos and comedy i guess you could say from other youtubers some of which are my favorites
YOU1000000044_S0000962	
YOU1000000044_S0000963	
YOU1000000044_S0000964	it is a great idea to put your videos in the playlist yeah it is a great way of showing people what it is about and and you know let them watch it as well
YOU1000000044_S0000965	you can never be enough list including your own
YOU1000000044_S0000966

YOU1000000044_S0000968	definitely good for for the algorithm as well
YOU1000000044_S0000969	
YOU1000000044_S0000971	but they also going back to the reason i made my channel
YOU1000000044_S0000972	aside from the me making the channel as a place to start my videos
YOU1000000044_S0000973	i did as i said you know i did not think anyone would even watch
YOU1000000044_S0000974	i did not even know i had just already know sort of made the assumption you know no one would probably like them anyway but
YOU1000000044_S0000975	eventually you know people started to take notice it was slow at 1st after a few months my channel had gotten to like i think 22 subscribers
YOU1000000044_S0000976	then it started to drop and i was wondering okay you know what was i doing wrong okay
YOU1000000044_S0000977	if you look at my playlist that i filmed in fulton take note none of the videos are named
YOU1000000044_S0000978	i did not name like i do not think i even named one until like a few weeks back
YOU1000000044_S0000979	and i mean i had footage from cash or drive from charland north carolina to as west virginia
YOU1000000044_S0000980	and keep in mind when i was filming these videos i had earlier camera it was a i think it was a sony camera
YOU1000000044_S0000981	it was not a camcorder in fact hang on a minute i have the newest camrys from alaska right here
YOU1000000044_S0000983	get it out here
YOU1000000044_S0000985	this is this is it this is what i have been using since 2016 and it is proven to be a very good camera
YOU1000000044_S0000986	i got it specifically for the trip to alaska
YOU1000000044_S0000987	
YOU1000000044_S0000989	that is one of the best cameras i have used
YOU1000000044_S0000990	well that is the biggest thing is if you are comfortable with it that is that is what makes everything
YOU1000000044_S0000991	i am comfortable with it i can tell you that but the phone i am using to livestream is actually one of the newer electronics i have gotten in a while
YOU1000000044_S0000992	the phone i used to have was one my dad had and it did not live stream
YOU1000000044_S0000993	even when i recorded with normal camera when you zoomed in on the camera it made everything pixelated 0 my god i hated it i was annoyed by that
YOU1000000044_S0000994	i could not do it on any little details i wanted to get
YOU1000000044_S0000996	i felt that phone where the camera zoomed out most of the time or just barely zoomed in but this one
YOU1000000044_S0000997	like for instance if i do this here let me if you are watching the stream careful forsake camera footage here let me just do this as an example here okay
YOU1000000044_S0000998	so you see my phone here right you see it is aiming towards the computer seeing yeah i see
YOU1000000044_S0001000	zoom in here look at that it picks up even the computer screens pixels and then i can see the little details in the buildings in the photo behind
YOU1000000044_S0001001	that is amazing what kind of fun is that
YOU1000000044_S0001002	yeah it is verizon 5 i think is what it is called
YOU1000000044_S0001003	
YOU1000000044_S0001005	very good phone it is one of the newest phones i had gotten my god it is worked well only problem with my old phone i could record and sort of that 1st person camera view there
YOU1000000044_S0001006	for almost an hour a few minutes
YOU1000000044_S0001007	now with this one i am only i am limited to only 5 minutes so i usually film multiview
YOU1000000044_S0001008	that is how i got a lot of the video in my bahamas trip filmed it was in multiview function where you saw my face on one side and then you saw what i wanted the viewers to see on the other
YOU1000000044_S0001009	a lot of video filmed in the bahamas with a steel drummer artist named cordial he was good at playing music on the steel drums
YOU1000000044_S0001010	
YOU1000000044_S0001011	and i had hello
YOU1000000044_S0001013	you inspired me i never thought to take a picture of what we are doing here
YOU1000000044_S0001015	as for everything
YOU1000000044_S0001017	you good to talk to you know that you really are

YOU1000000044_S0001022	you can all everyone can come together and just have a good time that is the beauty of it
YOU1000000044_S0001023	that is what it looks like from our side
YOU1000000044_S0001024	okay wow now that is truly professional i like that 0 my god this is
YOU1000000044_S0001025	thrown together as it can be
YOU1000000044_S0001026	better it is better than the setup i have i have just this one laptop and which this laptop is the only one i have
YOU1000000044_S0001027	do not even have an editing software on it okay
YOU1000000044_S0001028	keep that in mind keep that in mind
YOU1000000044_S0001030	it is i do not mean to pick back
YOU1000000044_S0001031	you know going back to the channel again i mean i am sorry i do not mean
YOU1000000044_S0001032	yeah the other reason is become one which is sort of another this other reason has become more recent to me
YOU1000000044_S0001033	that is i have 2 younger sisters one is named patin the other is named aubrey aubrey is the more recent of the 2 and
YOU1000000044_S0001034	they came well after me by quite a few years and
YOU1000000044_S0001035	then i realized you know i do not know if my grandmother would be able to i would still be able to travel by the time my sister those 2 reached my age
YOU1000000044_S0001036	i do not even know and i do not mean any offense to her
YOU1000000044_S0001037	no no
YOU1000000044_S0001038	she is in her late 60 s and i do not know if she would be you know still
YOU1000000044_S0001039	you know things change in a moment you never know
YOU1000000044_S0001040	i do not know if she would still be alive when aubrey is my age
YOU1000000044_S0001041	
YOU1000000044_S0001042	so the reason i wanted to make my channel now is so those 2 can see my videos and see the trips that she and i went on together
YOU1000000044_S0001043	
YOU1000000044_S0001044	keep in mind i have been traveling with her like i said when i 1st came on here since 2008
YOU1000000044_S0001045	a lot of those early trips have never been filmed
YOU1000000044_S0001046	i asked her recently you know if we had time or when we had time available if we could try and revisit some of the places we 1st traveled to
YOU1000000044_S0001047	the 1st place i ever went to with her was to kennesaw georgia now that is near atlanta
YOU1000000044_S0001048	and it is where 2 civil war steam locomotives are housed one named the general the other is named texas
YOU1000000044_S0001049	
YOU1000000044_S0001050	and if you do not know what the andrews rate is i recommend looking it up it is quite unique and it is quite interesting as to how it all played out
YOU1000000044_S0001051	both locomotives are preserved and i was amazed by how the story about it
YOU1000000044_S0001052	
YOU1000000044_S0001053	it took place during the american civil war
YOU1000000044_S0001054	where some union spies tried to take a confederate locomotive to burn railroad bridges along confederate rail lines
YOU1000000044_S0001055	try and stop confederate supply movements but unfortunately their plan failed and they were eventually captured by the confederates
YOU1000000044_S0001056	i think all of them received the medal of honor the ones who survived the bow camp
YOU1000000044_S0001058	i think all of them got the medal of honor and i think they were the 1st to receive it except andrew he was excluded as a civilian unfortunately
YOU1000000044_S0001059	but the film has been the event has been you know sort of i guess you could say immortalized thanks to both locomotives being preserved
YOU1000000044_S0001060	the general was restored to operating condition in the 1960 s during the civil wars since centennial
YOU1000000044_S0001061	right
YOU1000000044_S0001062	and eventually it found its way into georgia and it has been on display in kennesaw ever since
YOU1000000044_S0001063	texas was on display at the atlanta cyclorama until recently when i went to space north carolina for cosmetic restoration from what i heard
YOU1000000044_S0001064	you have amazing retention it is unbelievable memory and and the way you present yourself is quite it is quite amazing
YOU1000000044_S0001065	i try

YOU1000000044_S0001071	and it can happen in a moment is notice
YOU1000000044_S0001072	and i think you know i have witnessed i mean i have had to go through 2 deaths in my family
YOU1000000044_S0001073	
YOU1000000044_S0001074	
YOU1000000044_S0001075	it was my grandmother is mom whom we called dana she what she from what i heard at 1st

YOU1000000044_S0001077	0 no
YOU1000000044_S0001078	i mean the she was i think she was asleep but and from what i was told you know i think she died from smoking
YOU1000000044_S0001079	the fire did not get her her bedroom was untouched and from what from what i was told she did not even know anything had happened she had passed in her sleep
YOU1000000044_S0001080	which is good she did not suffer which is good but i mean it it hit me hard
YOU1000000044_S0001081	i had never not once now keep in mind i was only 11 years old when this happened i had never experienced a death in my family before
YOU1000000044_S0001082	and let me tell you it was unexpected i did not even know until
YOU1000000044_S0001084	my my mom is dad my mom is mother my mom is mother back
YOU1000000044_S0001086	my dad is mother who is the one who was have been telling you all about she is the one who has been taking me on these trips until he called my mom and told her
YOU1000000044_S0001087	and i mean it still hurts for me to think about it
YOU1000000044_S0001088	and unfortunately it i mean that was not going to be the last time i sort of had a you know visit from i guess you could say death so to speak
YOU1000000044_S0001089	i mean a few years later recently we lost my stepfather is grandmother who we called grandma sandy
YOU1000000044_S0001090	and from what i remember she she suffered a heart attack now keep in mind no i did not get a chance to say goodbye to her
YOU1000000044_S0001091	but sandy 0 gosh that was the 1st funeral i ever attended
YOU1000000044_S0001092	that that was the 1st time i had ever seen a person i once saw alive when they were deceased that has never left me
YOU1000000044_S0001093	it is definitely quite something to go through especially when you are a child it is definitely leaves mark for sure
YOU1000000044_S0001094	i can relate so i understand what you are talking about for sure
YOU1000000044_S0001095	but i am great grateful for the memories that we have from the people that have passed
YOU1000000044_S0001096	and i am very happy that you have memories that you are making with your grandma a while traveling
YOU1000000044_S0001097	believe me i am really glad and i mean i like i like to spend as much time with her as i can and believe me
YOU1000000044_S0001098	i mean i have a deep respect for like i said people who have come before my time she is one of them and she is a very kind lady
YOU1000000044_S0001099	very wise humorous he is actually hosting a party for some friends right now as i am speaking
YOU1000000044_S0001101	he is the hostess of stratford if you will
YOU1000000044_S0001102	so that one
YOU1000000044_S0001103	we are going we are actually going to be going on another trip in a few days we are going to be revisiting a few towns in godown in southwest georgia
YOU1000000044_S0001104	one of them is named cordial georgia i have footage of my 1st trip there on my channel
YOU1000000044_S0001105	then we are going back is because of a few things we were not able to do there on my 1st trip
YOU1000000044_S0001106	we were going to write an excursion train that is down there called the same short line they have a website you can probably look it up i think
YOU1000000044_S0001107	and they were not running when we were down there before so we are going to try and go down there so i can film that when the trains running
YOU1000000044_S0001108	and we are going to go to a museum in tifton georgia which is a replica of a historic village
YOU1000000044_S0001109	and they have a lot of equipment there that is from like i think the 1890 s early 20th century
YOU1000000044_S0001110	and it sort of depicts early life in georgia i think from the 1830 s to the 1890 s and into like i think the early 1900s 1920 s i think
YOU1000000044_S0001111	i can not remember exactly how far in time it goes but it is really well done the historians that are really good at telling the story
YOU1000000044_S0001112	and all the buildings i think are original and i think there is only a few that have had to be rebuilt
YOU1000000044_S0001113	but they are rebuilt in such a way to where they do not look like they are modern they are kept they are built to where they are original
YOU1000000044_S0001114	which is amazing to me i was impressed at how well they kept all the buildings up and a lot of them actually had steam powered equipment
YOU1000000044_S0001115	keep in mind my 1st trip there none of it was running
YOU1000000044_S0001116	this time we my grandmother has a lot of friends
YOU1000000044_S0001117	and i think a friend of hers daughter who is like i think the curator or something is going to be there
YOU1000000044_S0001118	and they are hosting a festival there so a lot of their equipment is going to be running so that is going to be neat for me to check out and i am going to film it
YOU1000000044_S0001119	and i am hoping this will sort of play out like my return trip to cast where although i did not get a lot filmed on the 1st time i am hoping to get more done on the 2nd time
YOU1000000044_S0001120	
YOU1000000044_S0001121	that is not on that that is amazing you are traveling all the time
YOU1000000044_S0001122	not exactly all the time i do have school in the way though unfortunately

YOU1000000044_S0001129	so there we go okay so we are good sorry guys we got to do this when you are alive is the only way to try
YOU1000000044_S0001130	showing broadcast okay you are back
YOU1000000044_S0001132	
YOU1000000044_S0001133	perfect present to everyone this seems to be quite
YOU1000000044_S0001134	whoa okay
YOU1000000044_S0001136	well this is interesting
YOU1000000044_S0001138	i may have accidentally muted the stream for a bit that was
YOU1000000044_S0001139	not my intention okay keep that in mind i did not mean to do that that was a major fail on my part
YOU1000000044_S0001140	0 do not feel bad we have all been there like i said look at us right now
YOU1000000044_S0001141	you can actually see my reaction and what i was talking to myself about in the stream when i accidentally did it okay
YOU1000000044_S0001142	i was on my face can though so yeah
YOU1000000044_S0001143	baker bushcraft is saying that he is enjoying your historical perspective
YOU1000000044_S0001144	
YOU1000000044_S0001145	and he understands your connection to your grandmother and his was born in 1800s and had so thank you for the baker
YOU1000000044_S0001146	i honestly one of the reasons i have a major respect for the people who came before me is because
YOU1000000044_S0001147	i really would i really wish someone could go and interview all these people who were around and like who are still living from 1800
YOU1000000044_S0001148	in the 1900s
YOU1000000044_S0001149	and you know write their stories down because once that person dies their stories are lost for good and
YOU1000000044_S0001151	my stepfather is grandfather his name was tom butler he was a world war 2 veteran
YOU1000000044_S0001152	
YOU1000000044_S0001153	and unfortunately i do not think he was ever interviewed so a lot of his stories are only able to be retold through my stepfather is mouth and
YOU1000000044_S0001154	my stepfather actually has 2 japanese rifles that tom butler brought back
YOU1000000044_S0001155	wow yeah try doing that nowadays if you were in their service no offense war veterans out there no offense
YOU1000000044_S0001156	no i know i know what you are saying though i know they understand as well i am sure
YOU1000000044_S0001157	but i mean they also put in amazing service and we do thank them very much for their service and anybody who puts their life on the line
YOU1000000044_S0001158	but yeah some of these guys seen some very hard conditions and not much to work with you know it was very primitive
YOU1000000044_S0001159	i just wanted to show you if you have a 2nd if you would like to see it this is anna is grandfather he was general in the russian air force
YOU1000000044_S0001161	
YOU1000000044_S0001163	talk about russian style
YOU1000000044_S0001165	that was like a failed rushing impression just my bad
YOU1000000044_S0001166	that is all good that was him and there as well there
YOU1000000044_S0001167	and i saw this on my stream
YOU1000000044_S0001168	yeah go ahead
YOU1000000044_S0001169	
YOU1000000044_S0001170	wow and that is a world war one or a bad plan correct me is that world war one
YOU1000000044_S0001171	world war 2 world war one or that one yes excuse me 16 that is her great grandfather here on the left
YOU1000000044_S0001172	
YOU1000000044_S0001173	wow yeah did he ever tell you all any stories all his parents any stories about him
YOU1000000044_S0001174	yeah my grandfather he was a scientist and inventor
YOU1000000044_S0001175	mostly like to talk about his innovations and things like that
YOU1000000044_S0001176	i think he is seen a lot in world war 2 that he did not want to talk about because probably it was too traumatic
YOU1000000044_S0001177	i mean it is like some of those guys in vietnam i mean you know just with those i mean that is like that with every soldier i mean you know just what those guys went through alone is enough
YOU1000000044_S0001178	yes definitely
YOU1000000044_S0001179	exactly and my grandmother who also lived through the war and actually in the wartime
YOU1000000044_S0001180	was working in one of the factories putting together guns because that is what they were made to do
YOU1000000044_S0001181	she was telling me more stories about it but you know
YOU1000000044_S0001182	well like when she when she immigrated so to say was sent to latvia where i am from originally
YOU1000000044_S0001183	the city was still bombed through and she had to every morning go through the ruins of bombed through how city to get to work
YOU1000000044_S0001184	so she was telling me more about how it was during and even after the war and about rations and not having food and living on potatoes and all that
YOU1000000044_S0001185	sorry yeah my grandfather i think he got was he seen the blood of it so to say
YOU1000000044_S0001186	he was less talkative about the actual war things and more about his inventions
YOU1000000044_S0001187	and the picture you see up now this is
YOU1000000044_S0001188	noble youth
YOU1000000044_S0001189	he is quite a man i never got to meet him unfortunately he was taken early in life but
YOU1000000044_S0001190	0 that is the same with my stepfather is grandfather tom he died in 2004 so i really never got to meet him
YOU1000000044_S0001191	i mean there is one story now that he told my stepfather that my stepfather is told me so he is passed it down which is i am really glad for
YOU1000000044_S0001192	now i do not remember exactly this i can not now it may not be accurate with me but i think what how it went was you know
YOU1000000044_S0001193	tom was assigned to some of the land clearing teams which cleared out airstrips so
YOU1000000044_S0001194	plans could planes could not planes there is one of those parts were talking about i said plans and i meant to say planes
YOU1000000044_S0001196	he was clearing out airstrips on one of i guess the occupied islands so that our planes could land in and
YOU1000000044_S0001197	out of nowhere a japanese sniper started shooting at him he was using a bulldozer at the time from what i was told
YOU1000000044_S0001198	so what he did was to protect himself and shield himself was he raised the bucket of the bulldozer up so that the bullets would hit the bucket
YOU1000000044_S0001199	and i guess when he found the tree the sniper was in he used the bulldozer and ram the tree the sniper was in and knocked the tree down
YOU1000000044_S0001200	wow
YOU1000000044_S0001201	and i think what he did then was he tied the sniper up and i think that was how he got the rifle that my stepfather now has
YOU1000000044_S0001202	i could be wrong on that okay i would have to ask my stepfather for more confirmation on in terms of accuracy but
YOU1000000044_S0001203	see that is the thing it is kind of like with civil war veterans you know that is what is happening now to a lot of these world war 2 guys
YOU1000000044_S0001204	i mean once you know you know because the civil war once the last veteran died in 1959 you know that story is pretty pretty much forgotten heck
YOU1000000044_S0001205	they hardly even teach me about it in my school can you believe it
YOU1000000044_S0001206	learn more about it thanks to a documentary that can ken burns made about it than what they are teaching me about it in school
YOU1000000044_S0001207	yeah that is an unfortunate side but i believe you on that
YOU1000000044_S0001208	
YOU1000000044_S0001209	by the way getting back to the recording memories so to say or interviews with people that are older
YOU1000000044_S0001210	i have recently gotten to a thing called storycorps i do not know if you have that
YOU1000000044_S0001211	it is basically it is a website mostly an app where it has either already pre prepared questions
YOU1000000044_S0001212	or you can make your own and make like an interview style going through those questions and record it and save it on a cloud
YOU1000000044_S0001213	and you can either share it or leave it privately but that is i find it is a great way of preserving things that we were just talking about
YOU1000000044_S0001214	what i am doing i am doing it with my son sometimes
YOU1000000044_S0001215	that way of preserving more of the way his ideas are changing through the time he is growing up
YOU1000000044_S0001216	but lots of people are actually using it to talk with older generation so it is something to look into so called storycorps
YOU1000000044_S0001217	all right i will look into it also you are going to find me crazy but what if i told you i have actually met in my lifetime 3 world war 2 veterans though i have actually met 3 of them
YOU1000000044_S0001218	
YOU1000000044_S0001219	
YOU1000000044_S0001220	i met the 1st one on the plane flight back from seattle it was after plane touchdown in atlanta
YOU1000000044_S0001221	and as we were getting off i just happened to glance over and saw his hat and it showed he was world war 2 veteran i mean i did not say anything to him i just saluted
YOU1000000044_S0001222	he actually turned to me and he smiled and i mean that i was glad i mean because i mean i already knew those guys were starting to be forgot
YOU1000000044_S0001223	because you know i think over i think it said over i think a 1000 are dying each day
YOU1000000044_S0001224	
YOU1000000044_S0001225	unfortunate but after that i think the 2nd one i met was i met him he was at home depot
YOU1000000044_S0001226	it was either in commerce or east side in georgia i can not remember exactly where but
YOU1000000044_S0001227	i ended up talking to him and he actually showed me a picture of the plane he was assigned to
YOU1000000044_S0001228	it was either a b 17 bomber or 25 i can not remember exactly
YOU1000000044_S0001229	he and i were talking and i saluted him i mean every time i see a war veteran i salute them
YOU1000000044_S0001231	and i mean i was deeply impressed by what you know he had gone through i mean
YOU1000000044_S0001233	that was sort of an honor for me i had never gotten a chance to talk to another war veteran
YOU1000000044_S0001234	the 3rd one i have met was one who was able to attend our veterans day assembly at my school
YOU1000000044_S0001235	and i spoke to him and a few other war veterans from other wars and i mean he was the oldest one there
YOU1000000044_S0001237	but yeah i mean that is sort of never left me either and i mean i feel it kind of an honor that i was able to meet those guys because i mean they saw what true war was
YOU1000000044_S0001239	and unfortunately i mean i know a lot of other veterans on other sides have seen far worse unfortunately which is you know like i said you know
YOU1000000044_S0001241	that is what i mean you know and just what those guys went through you know is enough that is what i mean
YOU1000000044_S0001242	
YOU1000000044_S0001243	i mean i have actually never met a world war 2 soldier who is actually been to like say normandy or
YOU1000000044_S0001244	you know the ones who the guy some of the guys who actually you know fought back through france but
YOU1000000044_S0001246	i mean i do not know if they were i do not know if they had been interviewed before or not but still i mean like i said that that has stuck with me
YOU1000000044_S0001247	yeah definitely a lot there of history for sure thank you very much for all your stories it is amazing yeah
YOU1000000044_S0001248	you have 17 you lived a whole life already yes
YOU1000000044_S0001249	but you never know i might do a lot more
YOU1000000044_S0001251	i said you know i have always said you know life is one of the greatest gifts god can give and it is up to you know each and every one of us to live our lives as best we can
YOU1000000044_S0001252	and it is up to us to decide which path to take in life i mean
YOU1000000044_S0001253	you can either take the good path make the right choices and make the right decisions and you will end up living a happy long life
YOU1000000044_S0001254	i mean unfortunately for some they just people they just chose to take the bad take the bad path and they make the bad choices and unfortunately they
YOU1000000044_S0001255	do not live very long lives and it is usually ones that they end up either regretting in the end or just are not happy with
YOU1000000044_S0001256	that is very true
YOU1000000044_S0001257	i mean the choice can not be forced i mean it is our choice and choice it is our choice alone

YOU1000000044_S0001308	this is from our trip my backpacking trip i did and that is the different countries that i visited when i spent 2 weeks by train in europe
YOU1000000044_S0001309	but that one that you are asking about particularly that is lubrano slovenia
YOU1000000044_S0001310	and one was we each have a big picture behind one of the coaches here we each picked one of our favorites and agana pickers was from iceland
YOU1000000044_S0001311	and this was mine because it was just fun it was one of the most beautiful places surprisingly beautiful i did not think it was it could be that beautiful there so
YOU1000000044_S0001312	that is why i picked that one to be the rest are all black and white from the other countries but we did one color one each
YOU1000000044_S0001313	yeah we talked a little bit in the beginning of the dream about traveling and places in europe
YOU1000000044_S0001314	so if you have anything to add to that please welcome and drop a comment
YOU1000000044_S0001315	that is amazing so beautiful hazel says yes
YOU1000000044_S0001316	thank you yeah yeah it is my go to pitcher
YOU1000000044_S0001317	as i stated i never buy souvenirs the only souvenirs i actually buy is i buy one fridge magnet in every country
YOU1000000044_S0001318	and that actually goes on my mom is fridge because that was started as kind of a tradition
YOU1000000044_S0001319	and i am not into souvenirs the pictures memories are my souvenirs so i hold them very closely
YOU1000000044_S0001320	so every picture i look at around the room kind of tells a story or a moment in time from different travels
YOU1000000044_S0001321	omena that we had some great adventures
YOU1000000044_S0001322	our 1st trip we ever did together was estonia we went to talons which was absolutely incredible
YOU1000000044_S0001323	and then we took the ferry it was about what it is an hour and a half right i think yeah to helsinki finland
YOU1000000044_S0001324	and it was unbelievable it was so amazing 1st time
YOU1000000044_S0001325	helsinki finland was actually one of my bucket list places i always pick the cold ones which is weird coming from canada but
YOU1000000044_S0001326	is it warm this evening in california hazel yeah i was my parting tip always shoot a 2nd
YOU1000000044_S0001327	my 2nd take saved me from reshoot last night definitely sure glad i had the footage you got that right
YOU1000000044_S0001328	the video i just did recently a biker bush car do not know if you have seen it she brought back the 80 s to montreal
YOU1000000044_S0001329	there is some panic shots of the city my poor son i think he was going to pull at his hair at one point because we are literally down there for 2 hours
YOU1000000044_S0001330	and we ended up with over 50 some shots of each section just because it is that time of evening when it is hard to guess what the lighting is going to be like
YOU1000000044_S0001331	what it will look like once you put it through the editing box and like you say they do get lost so yes definitely always back up everything
YOU1000000044_S0001332	because you will never recreate that moment now maybe you will go and shoot it even better but most times yeah you will never recreate that moment so definitely double up
YOU1000000044_S0001333	triple up if you can
YOU1000000044_S0001334	that is the beauty of the digital technologies now that we can do that
YOU1000000044_S0001335	you know when we were using 8 millimeters
YOU1000000044_S0001336	
YOU1000000044_S0001337	or film in the camera for photos unfortunately you were not able to do that and fortunately or fortunately some might say
YOU1000000044_S0001338	but now you can do as many takes or as many pictures as possible and if you can do it and then you can choose the best one
YOU1000000044_S0001339	like even forget a photographer just somebody went to a wedding and they are sitting there with a roll of their film you know the 35 millimeter we all remember what that was like you know
YOU1000000044_S0001340	you were waiting and waiting and waiting for that perfect shot because you only had 3 shots left on your camera
YOU1000000044_S0001342	i like that baker bushcraft well everyone is perfect until you are in post how true is that
YOU1000000044_S0001343	how many times have you looked screen thought yeah this is this is a killer shot you get home and it looks absolutely horrible or you lost it that is the truth
YOU1000000044_S0001344	as many professionals say i think too you have to do the most preparation before the shot as possible
YOU1000000044_S0001345	the most you can do before is better yeah if there is something you can do in post great
YOU1000000044_S0001346	but the more you do with the light with composition with the way you are moving your camera the like everything which you can do before it and make sure before you actually shoot if it is possible
YOU1000000044_S0001347	preparation is a key lots of preparation you know and in scouting the place out if i had a new place that i wanted to shoot i will definitely walk all around it
YOU1000000044_S0001348	i will look for things that are going to look horrible later on in film i have seen myself picking up garbage by a train yard one time literally i picked up probably 25 pieces
YOU1000000044_S0001349	because it was an amazing place to shoot but of course litter was blowing off the highway and yes you might notice it so much when you are looking through the camera
YOU1000000044_S0001350	but when you get into post like like wiker says that it really sticks
YOU1000000044_S0001351	and that is an awful thing when you put all 23 hours work into something just to bring it back and it is all non usable
YOU1000000044_S0001353	definitely and i think it is the details that makes a difference as you said picking up the garbage
YOU1000000044_S0001354	you know is noticing these details that might be distracting in your video or your photo and getting rid of them
YOU1000000044_S0001355	or making it just a little bit different you know those details is what makes the difference
YOU1000000044_S0001356	
YOU1000000044_S0001357	when you watch the video or photo
YOU1000000044_S0001358	like i do not do as much photography but when i take photos i kind of do the same as i do with video
YOU1000000044_S0001359	the windmill train that was brought up a while ago that is a great example there is a shot in the town where i grew up cascadia where it is looking the train is crossing the trussel bridge
YOU1000000044_S0001360	there was lots of open places to shoot it but it was so much more interesting i went down by the bank and you have poplar trees that were kind of intertwined a bit
YOU1000000044_S0001361	i bent back a couple of them i tried not to break them if i did not have to so when i so i would have some trees in front of it you know some nice little branches
YOU1000000044_S0001362	and that is so many people try to go for this like crystal clear unobstructed view
YOU1000000044_S0001363	but when you shoot like that you have just a couple of branches here and there it gives you that peeping feel that people love like they are they have found something special
YOU1000000044_S0001364	and it really really brings out your shot it makes the subject so much more interesting
YOU1000000044_S0001365	you are going to remember that the shot that is taken from standing and eye level is the most common shot you are going to ever see anywhere
YOU1000000044_S0001366	
YOU1000000044_S0001367	so when before you are taking a video or photo think about that
YOU1000000044_S0001368	if you are standing and you are doing this probably 6000 people already did that especially if it is somewhere in the tourist place
YOU1000000044_S0001369	so once you do this remember that and try to go either lower or or in a different angle that is really good point yeah just so it is different
YOU1000000044_S0001370	because after even with the best post edit there is going to be 1000s of pictures of a straight up like straight up grand canyon
YOU1000000044_S0001371	and all the other places you could ever imagine
YOU1000000044_S0001372	definitely
YOU1000000044_S0001373	yes when you think this move
YOU1000000044_S0001374	shot under your leg
YOU1000000044_S0001375	even if it came out a tiny bit blurry in one corner will give it more perspective because the angle shot from versus straight on one that is crystal clear
YOU1000000044_S0001376	video i almost always shoot as well as to my camera as well but i am almost always shooting at chess level
YOU1000000044_S0001377	and that is to kind of give in between view of child and adult most animals would see from that perspective
YOU1000000044_S0001378	so i think it is the most relatable to most people that are watching your work now is that always the case time will tell
YOU1000000044_S0001379	me i just found that is kind of what is worked the best for myself
YOU1000000044_S0001381	another tip for taking pictures by the way undermined because you were saying about the chest level
YOU1000000044_S0001382	if you want to have a nice and clear picture try to hold the camera not in a straight out hands but as close as possible to your body
YOU1000000044_S0001383	basically your body is a tripod
YOU1000000044_S0001384	yeah definitely for sure
YOU1000000044_S0001385	lots of people do they they do this because now we can see the back of the screen in the view so we want to see what is there
YOU1000000044_S0001386	do not do that that is where your hands start to get shaky
YOU1000000044_S0001387	got no control
YOU1000000044_S0001388	no control at all the closer you are to your body with it the better the picture or the video is because it works like a tripod
YOU1000000044_S0001389	and yes fanboy talk once again will bring up peter mckinnon he gave a great example for how he was doing dropping shots
YOU1000000044_S0001390	was to put the camera strap around your neck hold your camera out so that way you do have some support already you know you do not want it too far away from you
YOU1000000044_S0001391	just straps about here which is usually for most people when they pick up their camera you can shoot and just on one foot just let yourself pivot ahead
YOU1000000044_S0001392	and you only have about 23 seconds but you can actually catch a lot in that 23 seconds
YOU1000000044_S0001393	and you get a nice panning shot so if you want like a flower or maybe a small brook somewhere and you want to get that nice panning shot is doing that
YOU1000000044_S0001394	just let yourself standing on one foot and let yourself just lightly go ahead on your own momentum and you can really get some great shots
YOU1000000044_S0001395	and do that from different angles hold the camera up with the sling the strap and just turn it slowly
YOU1000000044_S0001396	you are not going to be able to keep it forever but you you you always know you keep that little bit of steady momentum as you do it and that really helps a lot
YOU1000000044_S0001398	kasel is asking if we are carrying around charge batteries
YOU1000000044_S0001399	definitely all kinds of charge batteries
YOU1000000044_S0001400	2nd one is always in the camera charge
YOU1000000044_S0001401	every every time i come back from somewhere where i got the shot i come back and i charge right away the camera the battery
YOU1000000044_S0001402	that is just given so there is always one charge inside and i think i have 4 or 5 yeah
YOU1000000044_S0001403	never a shortage of them that is for sure
YOU1000000044_S0001404	why because we sometimes shoot weddings and believe me i go through all of them and sometimes even need to charge extra
YOU1000000044_S0001405	and that is lithium batteries of sony camera that i am using
YOU1000000044_S0001406	so that is a lot that is a lot of batteries to go through in 8 hours sometimes
YOU1000000044_S0001407	but and why by the way because oftentimes as a wedding photographer or event photographer who go to baptism
YOU1000000044_S0001408	by the way we will have a shoot on on this sunday next sunday
YOU1000000044_S0001409	i do not want to lose a shot so i oftentimes just keep the the shutter open and just wait for the for the right moment
YOU1000000044_S0001410	i do not want to lose the emotion or the face expression so i just keep it open obviously batteries draining as i am doing that
YOU1000000044_S0001411	that is why i sometimes go through 56 of them during the event
YOU1000000044_S0001412	but yes definitely always always extra charging batteries even with the phone chargers always with me and we charge charge in the car
YOU1000000044_S0001413	because i do not you know not for being able to talk to but to take pictures even with the phone when i do not have my camera with me what about you
YOU1000000044_S0001414	me i keep i have 4 batteries and mine is a bit tricky for the simple reason the controller is my cell phone that is how that one is controlled
YOU1000000044_S0001415	so i have to keep extra batteries for a cellphone plus extra batteries for the camera itself
YOU1000000044_S0001416	the 4 lithium batteries for the camera as soon as one runs out i am literally plugging it in and charging it
YOU1000000044_S0001417	and i will try all day i will plan it out so when we do a wedding i will look around and see the different areas we are going to be filming where the plugins are available and i always try and preserve them in advance
YOU1000000044_S0001418	i will ask the dj or i will ask the concierge whoever has any control over them to at least save me one
YOU1000000044_S0001419	and from there i am just plugging in recharging i never take a chance i should get more batteries really
YOU1000000044_S0001420	for seems to work okay because i have always been lucky to plug them in but at some point my locks going to run out
YOU1000000044_S0001421	and it does you never know what magic moment we had a wedding one well the one with jeffrey and the
YOU1000000044_S0001422	
YOU1000000044_S0001423	i thought they were pretty much done with us and then all of a sudden they decided his mother in law was giving them this gift and they went on film
YOU1000000044_S0001424	and just by the grace of god i had enough battery left in the last battery to get the shot
YOU1000000044_S0001425	maybe not as many as i would like to but at least we got it covered
YOU1000000044_S0001426	things creep on you really quickly and you have got to be prepared for everything and batteries is the key
YOU1000000044_S0001427	batteries and sd cards
YOU1000000044_S0001428	because sd cards can crap out at you at any time you can shoot a lot more footage than you were ever expecting to shoot
YOU1000000044_S0001429	that is 2 things we always keep a lot of i actually keep mine in glasses case not for these glasses one before
YOU1000000044_S0001430	the snap close type that come with them that we usually never use well that one and that is where i keep all my cards and keep all my little bits that i need for that kind of stuff
YOU1000000044_S0001431	podcast is asking
YOU1000000044_S0001432	okay you you okay you have you have watched a variety of my videos now i want you to tell me what i am doing wrong
YOU1000000044_S0001433	and that is the thing i think we are all asking each other i know it is not it sounds like kind of a generic answer
YOU1000000044_S0001434	i do not think you are doing anything wrong like say we are not as either we are still learning and i mean we have gotten some really great compliments and i appreciate it
YOU1000000044_S0001436	a lot of it has been the marketing our site really it is just getting people to watch it that has been the biggest part of all for growing
YOU1000000044_S0001437	you got you got interest in content i do not see why people would not be interested into it it depends what you want to edit like i mean
YOU1000000044_S0001438	if you are going to go more into what what i do it does it is more of a learning curve there is people that are light years ahead of me
YOU1000000044_S0001439	but it is a lot more work so it takes you know and you need to make sure you have a decent computer for it
YOU1000000044_S0001440	it is a lot a lot and the same thing with photography a lot of youtube trial tutorials
YOU1000000044_S0001441	i am constantly on it trying either to learn what i need i will think okay well i want this to flash and turn and do whatever
YOU1000000044_S0001442	i am on youtube and looking for somebody who is done it already or something at least close enough
YOU1000000044_S0001443	and also watching my spare time to always look to see what somebody else is doing
YOU1000000044_S0001444	and it is an art all in itself editing you know and there is people who edit who are horrible at taking video
YOU1000000044_S0001445	and that is what is tricky about what we all do here and we got to remember that we have people here who love working with wood
YOU1000000044_S0001446	but now all of a sudden they also have to learn how to be video photographers they have to learn how to be editors they got to learn how to read analytics in youtube
YOU1000000044_S0001447	we wear so many hats now
YOU1000000044_S0001448	and we all wish kind of sometimes we had somebody myself taking video with my camera i do enjoy it no more
YOU1000000044_S0001449	it is more suited to the way i like to take i like to do my videography
YOU1000000044_S0001450	but i would be more than happy if somebody was shooting this stuff here like we could hire somebody doing that and i was sitting here just editing because that is where i feel the most creative
YOU1000000044_S0001451	now some people the exact opposite they will shoot for days they have such an amazing eye and they would rather cut off their own arm than have to do any video editing
YOU1000000044_S0001452	or marketing on youtube it is a whole package and you see what i am typing
YOU1000000044_S0001453	we are not experts
YOU1000000044_S0001454	you are too kind
YOU1000000044_S0001456	yeah we are we are just trying to help each other the same as we learn from other people what we are doing you know if anybody have questions does not mean that we have perfect answers i would not call this expert
YOU1000000044_S0001457	and if you have something that you can do that we have forgotten or know more about please i am all ears we would love to the whole point is for us to learn as well
YOU1000000044_S0001459	i asked them a question but they never got back to me some kind of lag in the chat system
YOU1000000044_S0001460	i would say so usually there is at any given time
YOU1000000044_S0001462	yeah i think we answered all your questions by the way i wanted to address your channel in general and please do not start
YOU1000000044_S0001464	i wanted to tell you just one thing and i know you do not want to hear about marketing you know how i remembered your channel
YOU1000000044_S0001465	i remembered your channel and out of all of the 1000s that we watched it is hard sometimes to remember which is which and you have got to go back again and again
YOU1000000044_S0001466	but what really strikes stroke acord is a thumbnail of your video of gillis bay
YOU1000000044_S0001467	he with yeah with a bird i thought the shot itself as a photographer 1st of all i thought it was amazing
YOU1000000044_S0001468	like i am like i remember andre was showing me your channel and i am like 0 my god look at that i like i could not believe the shot
YOU1000000044_S0001469	but what i am saying when i am looking at all your videos altogether it jumped out that thumbnail is just like 0 my god i want to see what is there
YOU1000000044_S0001470	
YOU1000000044_S0001471	and i think you should have that as an example to the rest of your videos yeah have your sundays like
YOU1000000044_S0001472	have your channel is name on them which is great
YOU1000000044_S0001473	but these capturing thumbnails like you have in these gillis bay video thumbnail do them like that on the rest of your video
YOU1000000044_S0001474	it is amazing i am telling you as a professional photographer i could not i could not believe my eyes like i needed to see up close and and that is how i remembered
YOU1000000044_S0001475	that is why i was coming back and watching other videos because of that thumbnail
YOU1000000044_S0001476	thumbnails are so important and we all kind of make that mistake at the beginning and i have been there many times
YOU1000000044_S0001477	the thumbnails that you see for our videos i have redone them i think it is 4 times now yeah to get them where i want to get them
YOU1000000044_S0001478	and some things i have learned like one of my favorite ones is the one of the latest ones we did was the train in the fog in kingston ontario
YOU1000000044_S0001479	before i would have taken a screenshot i would have been further back
YOU1000000044_S0001480	yes you could see the train yes you could probably guess there was a bit of fog in there
YOU1000000044_S0001481	but now if you look at it
YOU1000000044_S0001482	because the thumbnails smaller i and i take the shot bring it into photoshop and the 1st thing i do is i up the contrast a lot
YOU1000000044_S0001483	because it is smaller i really want to punch then i bring up the blocks so the shadows i still want you to see detail
YOU1000000044_S0001484	i am going to get it to the exact point the sweetest spot where it is as jet black as can be where you can still make out what is in there
YOU1000000044_S0001485	and then the fog was actually 0 my god i feel like on a drinking game so if i bring up peter mckinnon one more time
YOU1000000044_S0001486	but talk about getting ideas we were watching and he was showing about how to do motion blur to give your picture more depth
YOU1000000044_S0001487	and i have done that before but i had not done it so long and i have seen it and 2 days later i was working on the thumbnail for that i thought that is it that is what i am missing
YOU1000000044_S0001488	so i took the shot then layered on top of each other and then i added the motion blur to it
YOU1000000044_S0001489	and then started as a layer mask cleaning it out and gave it that mask where the train comes punching through the fog
YOU1000000044_S0001490	because people are not going to see the big picture that you are working on at the time
YOU1000000044_S0001491	like you see on the screen they are literally seeing this at the best of times
YOU1000000044_S0001492	so high res very very high contrast pictures is what works great
YOU1000000044_S0001493	and that picture like a said of the of the seagull like you nailed it there really nailed it and use that as your example and go back and do your thumbnail
YOU1000000044_S0001494	i know your bottle cap logo i like it it is very punchy
YOU1000000044_S0001495	i would almost to consider maybe finding the spot that you like to use it and use it in the same place in all your photos
YOU1000000044_S0001496	like if you notice our has pushed with the white band across the bottom and usually the 4 k on top
YOU1000000044_S0001497	except for a few of them where i did the photo series or the hour long trains i could not make it into 4 k it was too long
YOU1000000044_S0001498	and all it is is one photoshop document back it up of course
YOU1000000044_S0001499	but with every layer is all of these photos those thumbnails
YOU1000000044_S0001500	and i always just go in and add a new layer or a new folder in that and work on that
YOU1000000044_S0001501	so everything always stays in the same uniform scale every time
YOU1000000044_S0001502	so the 4 k logo is always in the same place the banner is always in the same place the only thing that changes the layers behind it
YOU1000000044_S0001503	maybe you can share screen one of his videos if you really want to hear
YOU1000000044_S0001504	
YOU1000000044_S0001505	the 1st one can you go over well we are going to ask him 1st and minds bottle caps would you mind if we opened up one of your videos to look at
YOU1000000044_S0001506	it is up to you you do not have to we understand completely if you would like to or not and if there is a certain video you would like us to look at just let us know
YOU1000000044_S0001508	i definitely would not do that without your permission
YOU1000000044_S0001509	yes you are right kasel also agrees with us that the thumbnail with the birds really jumps out of the right exactly
YOU1000000044_S0001510	as i said that is how i remember your channel bottle caps
YOU1000000044_S0001511	you are saying that you you have a huge photograph hanging on the wall of a bald headed eagle
YOU1000000044_S0001512	bringing a gift to the drone 1000 feet up a dead duck in it 0 my god i would love to see that
YOU1000000044_S0001513	that is amazing that is the stuff is what people want you have the content already
YOU1000000044_S0001514	you were saying the other the other day that your videos are only for local people
YOU1000000044_S0001515	no we are interested as i said we do not live there i am interested in your video
YOU1000000044_S0001516	exactly we are all local i mean our work i mean is mostly based out of montreal

YOU1000000044_S0001533	no and we are not bashing i mean we do not have all the answers i mean i am sure people look at earth and god what are they doing you know you can not please everybody
YOU1000000044_S0001534	kara says that you look like jack nicholson are you talking about my husband look like jack nicholson amazing resemblance
YOU1000000044_S0001535	let me look

YOU1000000044_S0001549	great opening shot
YOU1000000044_S0001551	that opening shot is absolutely do not see any problem with it
YOU1000000044_S0001552	i love the movement i love the pause in the beginning the composition of the shot the setup is great
YOU1000000044_S0001553	i would work a little bit on the histogram
YOU1000000044_S0001554	yes color that is why i said shot specifically meaning direction you were going into i knew would talk about color
YOU1000000044_S0001555	as you notice right here in this spot you can see that
YOU1000000044_S0001557	so you can see the only thing right now is you are missing is some definition between your cloud your water and your grass
YOU1000000044_S0001558	it is a nice shot and really it is not a ton of he does not need to rebuild it or anything it is just it is just bringing up your blocks a bit more
YOU1000000044_S0001559	you know around the grass here that the waterside grass it would make them more defined that way
YOU1000000044_S0001560	me personally i would boost up your blacks a bit and even though it is a nice blue sky that i would bring back maybe even a bit of a yellow tint just a tiny bit
YOU1000000044_S0001561	just to kind of bring a little little bit of life into the plants that are there or try your greens
YOU1000000044_S0001562	usually yellow gives you more cinematic look but you do not add much of it and that is a big key this is a side note
YOU1000000044_S0001563	that happens a lot where people get crazy with the slider they start moving it left right as far as it can go
YOU1000000044_S0001564	almost everything you do should be within maybe what 10% yeah i would say is a good number to keep in mind
YOU1000000044_S0001565	because you will distort it so badly in the end it will not even look recognizable anymore
YOU1000000044_S0001566	yeah yeah my suggestion would be bringing bringing the highlights a little bit down and bringing the shadows a little bit up
YOU1000000044_S0001567	the trick of getting the detail but not getting your shot too dark is getting your shadows a little bit up
YOU1000000044_S0001568	it is not going to be enough to blow it out completely
YOU1000000044_S0001569	but it is going to give that nice detail in the darkest parts as for example in your tree here
YOU1000000044_S0001570	that would be more visible right
YOU1000000044_S0001571	and also here maybe the highlights are good i would even say they are great
YOU1000000044_S0001572	but right here if you would just put the highlights a little bit down
YOU1000000044_S0001573	would be able to see more of the water more of the clouds more of that beautiful beautiful scenery in the background there
YOU1000000044_S0001574	excuse me so yeah so so that is what i would say with regards to that we can play it along again where are we okay
YOU1000000044_S0001576	beautiful movement the composition of the shot is amazing
YOU1000000044_S0001578	and you see right away here you are doing what a lot of people are doing online
YOU1000000044_S0001579	not to degrade your work saying that you you do not need to feel like you you have made some sort of abomination
YOU1000000044_S0001580	look at them as some of the birds like a little bit of contrast those birds will pop right out of the water
YOU1000000044_S0001582	but you a great shot here
YOU1000000044_S0001583	nice speed not too fast not too slow amazing
YOU1000000044_S0001584	here is right here here is what i would avoid and this is common with most drone shots everything was flowing i am going to put this back
YOU1000000044_S0001585	let me see even a bit further because i want to catch this what happens now you see the flow you had since you left land
YOU1000000044_S0001586	and you went up the beautiful right here where you are starting to turn that is where i would fade out
YOU1000000044_S0001587	i would never keep that turn in there and as you turn here once you straighten out and you find your angle that you are going
YOU1000000044_S0001589	that is where i would be bringing the video back in like here like let us go back see how you are kind of panning up here slowly
YOU1000000044_S0001590	you could use that as a shot cutting out all the middle between where i had stopped and here
YOU1000000044_S0001591	like this is nice it is getting
YOU1000000044_S0001593	the problem with drones and this has been a big big argument for a while
YOU1000000044_S0001595	if you are making a video and you just want to show flying a drone in an area leave it it is good
YOU1000000044_S0001596	if you want to make it more cinematic think of all the movies you have ever seen where there has been lifted camera
YOU1000000044_S0001597	they never show all the turnings because i mean a drone is not a perfect turn when it does one it is very very disjoint
YOU1000000044_S0001598	it is turning its rising it does not quite know where to go it is steadying out
YOU1000000044_S0001599	cut out the fat remember when i said even with my camera i never shoot a building if i want it straight on i always start away from it and pan across it
YOU1000000044_S0001600	because i will actually cut out that beginning part where i started and it is a little bit jittery and wait till the movement is fluid and that is where i will start my video
YOU1000000044_S0001601	and where it starts to get kind of going the same way at the end that is where i will cut it off
YOU1000000044_S0001602	that is that makes tons and tons and tons of difference in your footage
YOU1000000044_S0001603	you have got great footage here in this turn you can use that and then maybe cut it again afterwards
YOU1000000044_S0001605	see like this is beautiful panning shots like this you can use
YOU1000000044_S0001607	but you have got to separate them when it looks like it is moving off and the drone is steadying itself cut it out
YOU1000000044_S0001608	and maybe you will have to skip 5 seconds but at least you will have good footage and then you can show here
YOU1000000044_S0001609	so sometimes what that i would do is the 1st turn and then say there was a bit of a jitteriness and then another nice turn but almost the same level
YOU1000000044_S0001610	i would actually take that next i cut out the bad part and the next one i would zoom in maybe
YOU1000000044_S0001612	or zoom out as well 20% so it does not look like the same because then it looks like a jump shot here it is the same view
YOU1000000044_S0001613	so bring it in a bit more or bring it out a bit more
YOU1000000044_S0001615	yeah you definitely detail color look at all that color water like i just want a punch in it
YOU1000000044_S0001616	
YOU1000000044_S0001617	that blue and green would bring so much life in it right away
YOU1000000044_S0001618	also all the details in the woods there just they are just screaming to get out
YOU1000000044_S0001619	yeah
YOU1000000044_S0001621	you would be able to see so much also underneath the water the the the bed waterbed
YOU1000000044_S0001622	if you would go down in a highlight right here in this shot you would be able to see much more of the things under the water
YOU1000000044_S0001624	you know okay see where the camera got jittery right here that is where i would have cut that part out and then maybe start here if you have enough distance and it stays smooth
YOU1000000044_S0001625	cut cut out all your jittery parts and then you have them on the timeline and from there you have all your good cuts figure out how you work them into the music
YOU1000000044_S0001627	music is key you want everything to follow the beat you can zoom in and see every note how it goes up and down and you will see a pattern into it
YOU1000000044_S0001628	and from there you can really sink it up with the music and that is the biggest key to building something really great really quick
YOU1000000044_S0001629	i am just going to put this i am going to try something here control this is not the best way to do it but we are going to try control
YOU1000000044_S0001630	
YOU1000000044_S0001631	i do not know if this will even work but you know what we are going to try something here tonight we are going to try something new
YOU1000000044_S0001632	you can still see the chart right on
YOU1000000044_S0001633	
YOU1000000044_S0001634	
YOU1000000044_S0001636	now this is not the high res version of what you did i just took a screen screen capture
YOU1000000044_S0001638	we are going to try this so bear with us
YOU1000000044_S0001640	there is your shot
YOU1000000044_S0001642	now control let us even just try and this is we are doing this in part because it is a picture obviously but i am not going to try at levels just for the fun of it
YOU1000000044_S0001644	we are just going to yeah i am just going to bring up the call i am just going to bring up the saturation a little bit
YOU1000000044_S0001645	you guys see that
YOU1000000044_S0001647	i can not see it here
YOU1000000044_S0001648	you can not see it
YOU1000000044_S0001649	
YOU1000000044_S0001651	can you see anything on your screen
YOU1000000044_S0001653	tried photoshop today it was working it is just i am going to go back okay so it is not working
YOU1000000044_S0001654	i think it is just because of the bandwidth we tried it today quickly i tried today quickly and it was working i am going to try once more let us just
YOU1000000044_S0001656	we are just going to try one more time and see because this is hard to do and i have been reading that a lot of people
YOU1000000044_S0001657	that is why i want to go to the other program soon just have not a chance to set it up yet may be there
YOU1000000044_S0001659	let us see if that is where showing up on here
YOU1000000044_S0001661	still not out there yeah yeah okay
YOU1000000044_S0001663	you want to cause you are more the color person you want to
YOU1000000044_S0001664	to just show the easy way of doing it it does not really need a lot of it
YOU1000000044_S0001665	much of a difference that is why i am just going to bring up the bottom levels a little bit levels
YOU1000000044_S0001666	look already the blacks coming out to the back and then we will just play with the mids a little bit we will just pull them back
YOU1000000044_S0001668	maybe i will do a separate live where i can go through with a tutorial of how to get your picture puncher
YOU1000000044_S0001669	
YOU1000000044_S0001671	we can do a short one red one day
YOU1000000044_S0001672	you see if you bring all the saturation black but if you just raised the saturation a little bit you know your colors are already coming back and you can on the lightness
YOU1000000044_S0001673	you are already getting more now remember like i said this is a low res version because i just took a screenshot so it is quite hard to work with
YOU1000000044_S0001675	but it does not take much it really it is it is just playing with it you know
YOU1000000044_S0001677	but already your trees are coming out more i should have made a copy of it but let us see here
YOU1000000044_S0001679	there is the beginning
YOU1000000044_S0001681	and there is the end you can see already the buildings coming out more and stuff like that and i say this is just a very very fast edit on the fly
YOU1000000044_S0001682	right and like i said the composition on the flow of the video is amazing but
YOU1000000044_S0001683	if you toggle between before and after you can see how much puncher the
YOU1000000044_S0001685	it just grabs the eye more so bottle caps were talking the other day about our attention and that you need more hours and the people subscribe and leave
YOU1000000044_S0001686	but these are the things that keep them saying
YOU1000000044_S0001687	this is what keeps them watching your video to the end this is what keeps them not just subscribing but watching this video and then going to the next one and next one next
YOU1000000044_S0001688	because your videos are amazing i love drones who does not my god and your movement of it is amazing too
YOU1000000044_S0001689	all the elements are there and like i said once again it is about your editing best way to make it easier for yourself lay all your files out in your editor
YOU1000000044_S0001690	cut out all the bad parts right away what you do not need what looks bad if you have 20 seconds and 5 of its jittery cut out the jittery and start from there
YOU1000000044_S0001691	and see what you can put together
YOU1000000044_S0001692	of course you are saying that you are just taking the sd card basically putting it in the computer and uploading
YOU1000000044_S0001693	it is a great way of doing it
YOU1000000044_S0001694	but if you want those ewing hours that these are little details that count a lot and would make a world of difference
YOU1000000044_S0001695	just even a 10 minute work on your video would would make a difference i promise you i promise you start now
YOU1000000044_S0001696	you have all the elements you have everything else already working for you 10 minutes and it is going to be so much worth it
YOU1000000044_S0001698	try it for your next video and then get back to us and see how it went ok
YOU1000000044_S0001700	i see lots of people have drones here maverick as well
YOU1000000044_S0001701	i like you guys are getting in matt cook for oregon 0 i am so glad to have you back tonight and yeah i knew you were wanting to get more into the details of stuff like that
YOU1000000044_S0001703	and please you have any questions as well like i said i do not know if we can answer them all you do some nice work
YOU1000000044_S0001704	but anything or any advice for us as well or for anybody here too everybody we are just sharing thoughts and stuff like that
YOU1000000044_S0001705	that is the nice part about this it is nothing formal
YOU1000000044_S0001706	for sure if anybody else want to jump in and have any advice and please
YOU1000000044_S0001707	again if anybody have not subscribed yet to bottle caps go over do that if you like this video
YOU1000000044_S0001708	and please view the videos the videos they are really really beautiful
YOU1000000044_S0001710	0 man you are you are too kind you are too kind but thank you so much i mean we are just learning as we go
YOU1000000044_S0001711	and literally that is what we were saying to us is we are just watching every youtube tutorial there is
YOU1000000044_S0001712	i know we go on a lot about peter mckinnon yes he is canadian so we are a little biased
YOU1000000044_S0001713	but what we liked about him and a lot of people say 0 he is just a copycat he is not
YOU1000000044_S0001714	the thing he is doing that case did not do case was all above flash and i am not knocking him and he he did great for it
YOU1000000044_S0001715	but he does not hold a candle in the wind when it comes to actual cinematography cases an amazing storyteller
YOU1000000044_S0001716	they are all great their own rights i am not turning it into a pissing contest between them all i am just saying is for what we do we really appreciate how peter does it
YOU1000000044_S0001717	that guy i swear a guy could take video of blowing his nose and turn it into a cinematic event yeah from the tissue to get in the garbage you would be hooked on every moment of it
YOU1000000044_S0001718	that is a talent
YOU1000000044_S0001719	that is what it is is looking through and that is why i say we are cutting out all the bad jittery shots
YOU1000000044_S0001720	that is what takes somebody imagine if you were at a concert hearing your favorite singers of all time which we have and they have an off night
YOU1000000044_S0001721	it is they are singing the song and they are going the way it should be and then they hit that one flat note and then they get going again and they hit one more flat note
YOU1000000044_S0001722	well they sung 100s of notes but it is that flat note that just knocks everything off kilter and that is not you being picky that is a physical element of us
YOU1000000044_S0001724	yeah exactly it is it is the details yeah it is the details
YOU1000000044_S0001725	we lay out a video like i mean or a picture
YOU1000000044_S0001726	when we do a wedding she and i both spend a good couple of days
YOU1000000044_S0001727	a wedding for any usually involves 3 to 4000 pictures taken in 8 hours that is no joke
YOU1000000044_S0001728	so it is a week just weeding out what pictures are horrible right away yeah this is blurry yeah that is shaky i will take 15 of the same shot
YOU1000000044_S0001729	any photographer is going to tell you that calling out the photos after the event is probably the most tedious and most boring
YOU1000000044_S0001730	and i do not want to do it so ballcap i do not like calling my photos
YOU1000000044_S0001731	but in order to get to the part that i do like doing and to get the end results of the pictures i have to
YOU1000000044_S0001732	so i spend hours and hours of cooling those 1000s of 1000s of pictures to get through them and choose the ones that i am liking and client is going to like
YOU1000000044_S0001733	when we do when we are shooting the wedding the same for me i mean i have seen myself
YOU1000000044_S0001735	one.5 sometimes close to 2 sd cards full and those are 64 gig cards so there is a lot of footage to go through
YOU1000000044_S0001736	and it is tedious and video sometimes even worse because at least it so you can kind of jump you know with your viewer on the jpeg if you were to at least get rid of the bad ones right away
YOU1000000044_S0001737	i got to watch these things in 4 k that suck up so much juice out of a computer just to get in 2 minutes down the road realize just how horrible the whole thing was
YOU1000000044_S0001738	i have shot 30 the church i have shot at 30 different ways in that angle and 15 ways in this angle
YOU1000000044_S0001739	it sometimes takes me a night just to do one building sometimes that that is the price we pay for trying to get the best shot out of it
YOU1000000044_S0001740	and will weed through them and i have seen myself have to go back and dig through my scraps again because i am short on time
YOU1000000044_S0001741	i need 2 angles or once i get to the editor i am realizing 0 my god that was bad at the end i thought this one was good
YOU1000000044_S0001742	so i am going to chop it there and then find something else to piece in between or it does it is
YOU1000000044_S0001743	what drives me the craziest is a shot that is 12nd away from matching with the music
YOU1000000044_S0001744	do i slow it down is that going to look shaky or do i have to scrap it all and put in 2 shots or find a better shot to fit
YOU1000000044_S0001745	it is mixing and matching it is it is like playing tetris for a couple of days
YOU1000000044_S0001747	yeah and of course you know you do not have to go into deep editing of the stuff if that is not what you want to do but sometimes just a light touch is is great
YOU1000000044_S0001748	yeah there is a happy medium in all this
YOU1000000044_S0001749	i mean in this stuff we are paid for it and then also what we are doing our customers will be watching so we are kind of having to keep ourselves in check
YOU1000000044_S0001750	and we are our own worst critics i mean we constantly like we said the other night are telling each other
YOU1000000044_S0001751	80% of it is our work and the other 20% is telling the other one that they they are going too far into this and you have got to just accept it and move on
YOU1000000044_S0001752	you know it is like a good good bowl of soup just a little bit of salt it is going to make a world of difference
YOU1000000044_S0001753	and it is the little touches that make watch lots of people who do tutorials and just look for great ideas
YOU1000000044_S0001754	so many out there that is what we use all the time and it does make a difference it really does and they are doing it step by step so you always got a good reference
YOU1000000044_S0001756	there you go a little bit tough review hope you were not too hard
