1688-142285-0000	there's iron they say in all our blood and a grain or two perhaps is good but his he makes me harshly feel has got a little too much of steel anon
1688-142285-0001	margaret said mr hale as he returned from showing his guests downstairs i could not help watching your face with some anxiety when mr thornton made his confession of having been a shop-boy
1688-142285-0002	"'You don't mean that you thought me so silly?'
1688-142285-0003	I really like that account of himself, better than anything else he said.
1688-142285-0004	His statement of having been a shop boy was the thing I liked best of all.
1688-142285-0005	"'You who were always accusing people of being choppy at Hurston.'
1688-142285-0006	"'I don't think, Mr. Hale, you have done quite right "'in introducing such a person to us "'without telling us what he had been.'
1688-142285-0007	i really was very much afraid of showing him how much shocked i was at some parts of what he said
1688-142285-0008	his father dying in miserable circumstances.
1688-142285-0009	why it might have been in the workhouse
1688-142285-0010	His father speculated wildly, failed, and then killed himself because he could not bear the disgrace.
1688-142285-0011	all his former friends shrunk from the disclosures that had to be made of his dishonest gambling wild hopeless struggles made with other people's money to regain his own moderate portion of wealth
1688-142285-0012	No one came forwards to help the mother and this boy.
1688-142285-0013	at least no friend came forwards immediately and miss thornton is not one i fancy to wait till tardy kindness comes to find her out
1688-142285-0014	So they left Milton.
1688-142285-0015	how tainted asked her father
1688-142285-0016	Oh, papa, by that testing everything by the standard of wealth!
1688-142285-0017	when he spoke of the mechanical powers he evidently looked upon them only as new ways of extending trade and making money
1688-142285-0018	and the poor men around him they were poor because they were vicious out of the pale of his sympathies because they had not his iron nature and the capabilities that it gives him for being rich
1688-142285-0019	Not vicious. He never said that.
1688-142285-0020	Improvident and self-indulgent were his words.
1688-142285-0021	Margaret was collecting her mother's working materials and preparing to go to bed.
1688-142285-0022	just as she was leaving the room she hesitated she was inclined to make an acknowledgment which she thought would please her father but which to be full and true must include a little annoyance
1688-142285-0023	However, out it came.
1688-142285-0024	papa i do think mr thornton a very remarkable man but personally i don't like him at all
1688-142285-0025	"'And I do,' said her father, laughing.
1688-142285-0026	personally, as you call it, and all.
1688-142285-0027	I don't set him up for a hero, or anything of that kind.
1688-142285-0028	But good night, child.
1688-142285-0029	There were several other signs of something wrong about Mrs. Hale.
1688-142285-0030	she and dixon held mysterious consultations in a bedroom from which dixon would come out crying and cross as was a custom when any distress of her mistress called upon her sympathy
1688-142285-0031	once margaret had gone into the chamber soon after dixon left it and found her mother on her knees and as margaret stole out she caught a few words which were evidently a prayer for strength and patience to endure severe bodily suffering
1688-142285-0032	but though she received caresses and fond words back again in such profusion as would have gladdened her formerly yet she felt that there was a secret withheld from her and she believed it bore serious reference to her mother's health
1688-142285-0033	she lay awake very long this night planning how to lessen the evil influence of their milton life on her mother
1688-142285-0034	a servant to give dixon permanent assistance should be got if she gave up the whole time to the search and then at any rate her mother might have all the personal attentions she required and had been accustomed to her whole life
1688-142285-0035	visiting register offices seeing all manner of unlikely people and very few in the least likely absorbed margaret's time and thoughts for several days
1688-142285-0036	One afternoon, she met Bessie Higgins in the street and stopped to speak to her.
1688-142285-0037	Well, Bessie, how are you?
1688-142285-0038	better and not better if you know what that means
1688-142285-0039	"'Not exactly,' replied Margaret, smiling.
1688-142285-0040	i'm better in not being torn to pieces by coughing o nights but i'm weary and tired o milton and longing to get away to the land of boolah and when i think i'm farther and farther off my heart sinks and i'm no better i'm worse
1688-142285-0041	margaret turned round to walk alongside of the girl in her feeble progress homeward
1688-142285-0042	but for a minute or two she did not speak.
1688-142285-0043	At last, she said in a low voice,
1688-142285-0044	Bessie, do you wish to die?
1688-142285-0045	bessie was silent in her turn for a minute or two then she replied
1688-142285-0046	Not worse than many others, I reckon.
1688-142285-0047	But what was it?
1688-142285-0048	you know i'm a stranger here so perhaps i'm not so quick at understanding what you mean as if i'd lived all my life in milton
1688-142285-0049	i had forgotten what i said for the time continued margaret quietly
1688-142285-0050	I should have thought of it again when I was less busy. May I go with you now?
1688-142285-0051	the sharpness in her eye turned to a wistful longing as she met margaret's soft and friendly gaze
1688-142285-0052	as they turned up into a small court opening out into a squalid street bessie said
1688-142285-0053	you'll not be daunted if father's at home and speaks a bit gruffish at first
1688-142285-0054	"'but Nicholas was not at home when they entered.'
1688-142285-0055	gasped bessie at last
1688-142285-0056	Bessie took a long and feverish draught, and then fell back and shut her eyes.
1688-142285-0057	margaret bent over and said bessy don't be impatient with your life whatever it is or may have been
1688-142285-0058	Remember who gave it to you and made it what it is.
1688-142285-0059	now i'll not have my wench preach to
1688-142285-0060	but surely said margaret facing round you believe in what i said that god gave her life and ordered what kind of life it was to be
1688-142285-0061	I believe what I see, and no more.
1688-142285-0062	that's what i believe young woman
1688-142285-0063	I don't believe all I hear. No, not by a big deal.
1688-142285-0064	but who's come at last and who's welcome as long as he'll keep from preaching on what he knows not about
1688-142285-0065	It's simple and not far to fetch nor hard to work.
1688-142285-0066	but the girl only pleaded the more with margaret
1688-142285-0067	Don't think hardly on him. He's a good man, he is.
1688-142285-0068	I sometimes think I shall be milked with sorrow even in the city of God if either is not there.
1688-142285-0069	The feverish colour came into her cheeks and the feverish flame into her eye.
1688-142285-0070	but you'll be there father you shall oh my heart
1688-142285-0071	she put her hand to it and became ghastly pale
1688-142285-0072	margaret held her in her arms and put the weary head to rest upon her bosom
1688-142285-0073	Presently the spasm that foreshadowed death had passed away, and Bessie roused herself and said,
1688-142285-0074	i'll go to bed it's best place but catching at margaret's gown you'll come again i know you will but just say it
1688-142285-0075	"'I will come to-morrow,' said Margaret."
1688-142285-0076	Margaret went away very sad and thoughtful.
1688-142285-0077	She was late for tea at home.
1688-142285-0078	Have you met with a servant, dear?
1688-142285-0079	no mamma that anne buckley would never have done
1688-142285-0080	"'S'pose I try,' said Mr. Hale."
1688-142285-0081	Everybody else has had their turn at this great difficulty. Now, let me try.
1688-142285-0082	I may be the Cinderella to put on the slipper after all.
1688-142285-0083	what would you do papa how would you set about it
1688-142285-0084	well i would apply it to some good house-mother to recommend me one known to herself or her servants
1688-142285-0085	Very good, but we must first catch our housemother.
1688-142285-0086	the mother of whom you spoke to us said margaret
1688-142285-0087	"'Mr Thornton. The only mother he has, I believe,' said Mr Hale quietly.'
1688-142285-0088	Her mother added,
1688-142285-0089	Perhaps she may have a relation who might suit us and be glad of our place.
1688-142285-0090	she sounded to be such a careful economical person that i should like any one out of the same family
1688-142285-0091	my dear said mr hell alarmed pray don't go off on that idea
1688-142285-0092	I am sure at any rate she would not like strangers to know anything about it.
1688-142285-0093	take notice that this is not my kind of haughtiness papa if i have any at all which i don't agree to though you're always accusing me of it
1688-142285-0094	"'I don't know positively that it is hers either, "'but from little things I have gathered from him, I fancy so.'
1688-142285-0095	They cared too little to ask in what manner her son had spoken about her.
1998-15444-0000	if called to a case supposed or suspected to be one of poisoning the medical man has two duties to perform to save the patient's life and to place himself in a position to give evidence if called on to do so
1998-15444-0001	He should make inquiries as to symptoms and time at which fruit or medicine was last taken.
1998-15444-0002	he should notice the position and temperature of the body the condition of rigor mortis marks of violence appearance of lips and mouth
1998-15444-0003	In making a post-mortem examination, the alimentary canal should be removed and preserved for further investigation.
1998-15444-0004	The gut and the gullet being cut across between these ligatures, the stomach may be removed entire without spilling its contents.
1998-15444-0005	If the medical practitioner is in doubt on any point, he should obtain technical assistance from someone who has paid attention to the subject.
1998-15444-0006	In a case of attempted suicide by poisoning, is it the duty of the doctor to inform the police?
1998-15444-0007	The best ommatic is that which is at hand.
1998-15444-0008	The dose for an adult is 10 minims.
1998-15444-0009	Epimorphine is not allied in physiological action to morphine and may be given in cases of narcotic poisoning.
1998-15444-0010	Tickling the fosses with a fessel may excite vomiting.
1998-15444-0011	in using the elastic stomach tube some fluid should be introduced into the stomach before attempting to empty it or a portion of the mucous membrane may be sucked into the aperture
1998-15444-0012	The tube should be examined to see that it is not broken or cracked, as accidents have happened from neglecting this precaution.
1998-15444-0013	Antidotes are usually given hypodermically or if by mouth in the form of tablets.
1998-15444-0014	In the absence of a hypodermic syringe, the remedy may be given by the rectum.
1998-15444-0015	Notice the smell, color and general appearance of the matter submitted for examination.
1998-15444-0016	For the separation of an alkaloid, the following is the process of Stas-Otto.
1998-15444-0017	This process is based upon the principle that the salts of the alkaloids are soluble in alkaline water and insoluble in ether.
1998-15444-0018	The pure alkaloids, with the exception of morphine in its crystalline form, are soluble in ether.
1998-15444-0019	2. Cool the mixture and filter. Wash the residue with strong alcohol and mix the filtrates.
1998-15444-0020	The residue may be set aside for the detection of the metallic poisons if suspected. Expel the alcohol by careful evaporation.
1998-15444-0021	On the evaporation of the alcohol, the resinous and fatty matter separate.
1998-15444-0022	Evaporate the filtrate to a syrup and extract with successive portions of absolute alcohol.
1998-15444-0023	Separate the ethereal solution and evaporate.
1998-15444-0024	5. A part of this ethereal solution is poured into a watch glass and allowed to evaporate.
1998-15444-0025	to purify it add a small quantity of dilute sulfuric acid and after evaporating to three-quarters of its bulk add a saturated solution of carbonate of potash or soda
1998-15444-0026	boil the finely divided substance with about one-eighth its bulk of pure hydrochloric acid add from time to time potassic chloride until the solids are reduced to a straw yellow fluid
1998-15444-0027	the residue of the material after digestion with hydrochloric acid and potassium chlorate may have to be examined for silver lead and barium
1998-29454-0000	A thousand blessings from a grateful heart
1998-29454-0001	"'Perusal,' said the pawnbroker. "'That's the way to pronounce it.'
1998-29454-0002	His books told him that treasure is best hidden under loose boards, and as of course your house has a secret panel, which his had not,
1998-29454-0003	He got it up and pushed his treasures as far in as he could, along the rough crumbly surface of the lath and plaster.
1998-29454-0004	When Dickie came down, his aunt slightly slapped him, and he took the halfpenny and limped off obediently.
1998-29454-0005	He had never seen one before, and it interested him extremely.
1998-29454-0006	He looked about him, and knew that he did not at all know where he was.
1998-29454-0007	"'What's up, matey? Lost your way?' Dickie explained.
1998-29454-0008	When he said, have I been asleep?
1998-29454-0009	Here we have set them in.
1998-29454-0010	Not exactly, said the man, but it's all right.
1998-29454-0011	When it was over, the men asked Dickie if he could walk a little way, and when Dickie said he could, they set out in the most friendly way side by side.
1998-29454-0012	and the tea and all, and the egg,
1998-29454-0013	And this is the prettiest place ever I see.
1998-29454-0014	I shall catch it a fair treat as it is.
1998-29454-0015	She was waiting for the wood to boil the kettle when I come out. Mother?'
1998-29454-0016	And bad when she's in a good temper.
1998-29454-0017	That ain't what you'll be in when you gets back.
1998-29454-0018	"'I got his ticket,' said Dickie sadly. "'I'd best be getting home.'
1998-29454-0019	"'I wouldn't go home, not if I was you,' said the man.
1998-29454-0020	"'No,' said Dickie. "'Oh, no. No, I never.'
1998-29454-0021	I had it here, have I? Like what you are unto?
1998-29454-0022	Well, that'll show you the sort of man I am.
1998-29454-0023	The man's manner was so kind and hearty, the whole adventure was so wonderful and new. Is it country where you're going?'
1998-29454-0024	The sun shot long golden beams through the gaps in the hatch.
1998-29454-0025	A bird paused in its flight on a branch quite close and clung there swaying.
1998-29454-0026	He took out of his pocket a new envelope, a new sheet of paper and a new pencil, ready sharpened by machinery.
1998-29454-0027	And I ask you let me come along a you. Got that?
1998-29454-0028	Cut a short down then. Done?
1998-29454-0029	Then he folded it and put it in his pocket.
1998-29454-0030	Now we're square,' he said.
1998-29454-0031	They could put a man away for less than that.
1998-29454-0032	"'I see that they are in a book,' said Dickie Charmed.
1998-29454-0033	He rewarded the wake the last of the English, and I wondered what it stood for.
1998-29454-0034	white once and a half size Allee,
1998-29454-0035	Adventures? I should think so.
1998-29454-0036	"'Ah,' said Dickie, and a full silence fell between them.
1998-29454-0037	That was charming, but it was pleasant too to wash the mud off on the wet grass.
1998-29454-0038	Dickie always remembered that moment.
1998-29454-0039	"'So you shall,' said Mr. Beale. "'A regular wash all over, this very night. I always like a wash meself.'
1998-29454-0040	Some blokes think it pays to be dirty, but it don't.
1998-29454-0041	If you're clean, they say, honest poverty. And if you're dirty, they say, serve you right.
1998-29454-0042	you are good said dickie i do like you
1998-29454-0043	I know you will, said Dickie, with enthusiasm. I know how good you are.
1998-29454-0044	"'Bless me,' said Mr. Beale uncomfortably. "'Well, there.'
1998-29454-0045	Step out, Sunny, or we'll never get there this side of Christmas.
1998-29454-0046	Well, you'll know all about it presently.
1998-29455-0000	the singing and laughing went on long after he had fallen asleep and if later in the evening there were loud-voiced arguments or quarrels even dickie did not hear them
1998-29455-0001	what's all that there dicky asked pointing to the odd knobbly bundles of all sorts and shapes tied on to the perambulator's front
1998-29455-0002	"'Tell you what, mate, looks to me as if I took a fancy to you.'
1998-29455-0003	"'Swap me,' he said helplessly.
1998-29455-0004	"'Oh, look, Sir Dickie, the flowers!'
1998-29455-0005	"'They are only weeds,' said Beale.
1998-29455-0006	"'But I shall have them while they are alive,' said Dickie, as he had said to the pawnbroker about the moonflowers.
1998-29455-0007	Hi, there goes a rabbit.
1998-29455-0008	Seam, cross the row there, seam.
1998-29455-0009	"'How beautiful!' said Dickie, wriggling with delight.
1998-29455-0010	This life of the rabbit, as described by Mr. Beale, was the child's first glimpse of freedom. I'd like to be a rabbit.
1998-29455-0011	How am I to wear the room in pram if you goes on like as if you was a bag of veals?
1998-29455-0012	I like you next to my own daddy and Mr. Baxter next door.
1998-29455-0013	"'That's all right,' said Mr. Beale awkwardly.
1998-29455-0014	Dickie, quick to imitate, touched his.
1998-29455-0015	"'Poor little man,' said the lady, "'you miss your mother, don't you?'
1998-29455-0016	"'Oh, well done, little one,' said Mr. Beale to himself.
1998-29455-0017	the two travellers were left facing each other the richer by a penny and oh wonderful good fortune a whole half-crown
1998-29455-0018	"'No, I never,' said Dickie. "'Here's the steeble.'
1998-29455-0019	you stick to that said beale radiant with delight you're a fair masterpiece you are you earned it honest if ever a kid done
1998-29455-0020	They went on up the hill, as happy as anyone need wish to be.
1998-29455-0021	"'Please do not be too shocked.'
1998-29455-0022	Remember that neither of them knew any better.
1998-29455-0023	to the elder tramp, lice and pecking were natural means of livelihood.
1998-29455-0024	but you said the bed was the green curtains
1998-29455-0025	Which this and, not by no means,
1998-29455-0026	the night is full of interesting little sounds that will not at first let you sleep the rustle of little white things in the hedges the barking of dogs in distant farms the chirp of crickets and the quirking of frogs
1998-29455-0027	the new game of begging and inventing stories to interest the people from whom it was worth while to beg went on gaily day by day and week by week and dickie by constant practice grew so clever at taking his part in the acting that mr beale was quite dazed with admiration
1998-29455-0028	"'Blessed if I ever see such a nipper,' he said, over and over again.
1998-29455-0029	clever as a train-dog is and all outer as own
1998-29455-0030	I ain't sure, as I hadn't better stick to the road, and keep away from old ants like you, Jim.
1998-29455-0031	I hope he is clever enough to do what he's told. Keep his mugshot, that's all.'
1998-29455-0032	If he's straight, he'll do for me. And if he ain't, I'll do for him. See?
1998-29455-0033	"'See that bloke just now?' said Mr. Beale. "'Yes,' said Dickie.
1998-29455-0034	Well, you never see him.
1998-29455-0035	If anyone asks you if you ever see him, you never set eyes on him in all your bone, not to remember him.
1998-29455-0036	Dickie was full of questions, but Mr. Beale had no answers for them.
1998-29455-0037	nor was it sunday on which they took a rest and washed their shirts according to mr beale's rule of life
1998-29455-0038	they did not stay there but walked out across the downs where the skylarks were singing and on a dip of the downs came upon great stone walls and towers very strong and gray
1998-29455-0039	"'What's that there?' said Dickie.
2033-164914-0000	Replied he, Of a truth I heard him not, And I wot him not, And folks are all sleeping.
2033-164914-0001	But she said, Whomsoever thou seest awake, he is the reciter.
2033-164914-0002	Then said the eunuch, Are thou he who repeated poetry but now, And my lady heard him?
2033-164914-0003	Rejoined the eunuch, Who then was the reciter? Point him out to me.
2033-164914-0004	By Allah, replied the fireman, I tell thee the truth.
2033-164914-0005	Tell me what happened, Quetzal Amakan.
2033-164914-0006	what ails thee then that thou must needs recite verses seeing that we are tired out with walking and watching and all the folk are asleep for they require sleep to rest them of their fatigue
2033-164914-0007	And he also improvised the two following distichs.
2033-164914-0008	when ousat al-zaman heard the first improvisation she called to mind her father and her mother and her brother and their whilom home then she wept and cried to the eunuch and said to him woe to thee
2033-164914-0009	He who recited the first time hath recited a second time, And I heard him hard by.
2033-164914-0010	By Allah, and thou fetch him not to me, I will assuredly rouse the chamberlain on thee, And he shall beat thee and cast thee out.
2033-164914-0011	But take these hundred dinners, And give them to the singer, And bring him to me gently, And do him no hurt.
2033-164914-0012	Return quickly and linger not.
2033-164914-0013	When it was the seventy-third night,
2033-164914-0014	but the eunuch said i will not leave thee till thou show me who it was that recited the verses for i dread returning to my lady without him
2033-164914-0015	now when the fireman heard these words he feared for zaw al makan and wept with exceeding weeping and said to the eunuch by allah it was not i and i know him not
2033-164914-0016	so go thou to thy station and if thou again meet any one after this hour reciting aught of poetry whether he be near or far it will be i or some one i know and thou shalt not learn of him but by me
2033-164914-0017	then he kissed the eunuch's head and spake him fair till he went away but the castrato fetched around and returning secretly came and stood behind the fireman fearing to go back to his mistress without tidings
2033-164914-0018	i say what made my ignominy whatever the bitter cup i drain far be from me the land to flee nor will i bow to those who blame and for such love would deal me shame
2033-164914-0019	Then said the eunuch to Zawal Makan, Peace be with thee, O my lord.
2033-164914-0020	o my lord continued the eunuch and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say
2033-164914-0021	We will do thee no upright, O my son, nor wrong thee in aught. But our object is that thou bend thy gracious steps With me to my mistress, to receive her answer And return in will and safety, And thou shalt have a handsome present As one who bringeth good news.
2033-164914-0022	then the eunuch went out to zaal makan and said to him recite what verses thou knowest for my lady is here hard by listening to thee and after i will ask thee of thy name and thy native country and thy condition
2033-164915-0000	And also these
2033-164915-0001	Then she threw herself upon him, And he gathered her to his bosom, And the twain fell down in a fainting fit.
2033-164915-0002	when the eunuch saw this case he wondered at them and throwing over them somewhat to cover them waited till they should recover
2033-164915-0003	after a while they came to themselves and uzat al-zaman rejoiced with exceeding joy oppression and depression left her and gladness took the mastery of her and she repeated these verses
2033-164915-0004	Accordingly, she told him all that had come to her Since their separation at the Khan, And what had happened to her with the Badawi, How the merchant had bought her of him, And had taken her to her brother Sharkan, And had sold her to him, How he had freed her at the time of buying, How he had made a marriage contract with her, And had gone in to her, And how the king, their sire,
2033-164915-0005	But now go to thy master and bring him quickly to me.
2033-164915-0006	The chamberlain called the castrato, And charged him to do accordingly. So he replied, I hear and I obey. And he took his pages with him, And went out in search of the stalker, Till he found him in the rear of the caravan, Girding his ass and preparing for flight.
2033-164915-0007	she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the stalker girded his ass for flight and bespake himself saying o would i knew what is become of him
2033-164915-0008	i believe he hath denounced me to the eunuch hence these pages at about me and he hath made me an accomplice in his crime
2033-164915-0009	Why didst thou say, I never repeated these couplets, Nor do I know who repeated them? When it was thy companion?
2033-164915-0010	But now I will not leave thee between this place and Baghdad, And what betideth thy comrade shall betide thee.
2033-164915-0011	T'was as I feared the coming hills discerning, But unto Allah we are all returning.
2033-164915-0012	Then the eunuch cried upon the pages, saying, "'Take him off the ass!'
2033-164915-0013	And he answered, I am the chamberlain of the emir of Damascus, King Sharkan, son of Omar bin al-Numan, lord of Baghdad, and of the land of Khorasan, and I bring tribute and presents from him to his father in Baghdad.
2033-164915-0014	So fare ye forwards, no harm shall befall you Till you join his grand vizier Dandan.
2033-164915-0015	then he bade him be seated and questioned him and he replied that he was chamberlain to the emir of damascus and was bound to king omar with presents and the tribute of syria
2033-164915-0016	So it was agreed that we go to Damascus and fetch thence the king's son, Sharkan, And make him sultan over his father's realm.
2033-164915-0017	And amongst them were some who would have chosen the cadet Zawal Makan, For, quoth they, his name be light of the place, And he hath a sister, Nuzhat al-Zaman Haiz, The delight of the time. But they set out five years ago for Al-Hijaz, And none wotteth what is become of them.
2033-164916-0000	So he turned to the wazir dandan and said to him, Verily, your tale is a wonder of wonders.
2033-164916-0001	Know, O chief wazir, that here where you have encountered me Allah hath given you rest from fatigue And bringeth you your desire after the easiest of fashions, For that his almighty will restoreth to you Zawah Makan And his sister Nusat al-Zaman, Whereby we will settle the matter as we easily can.
2033-164916-0002	when the minister heard these words he rejoiced with great joy and said o chamberlain tell me the tale of the twain and what befell them and the cause of their long absence
2033-164916-0003	mackan bowed his head awhile and then said i accept the position for indeed there was no refusing and he was certified that the chamberlain had counseled him well and wisely and set him on the right way
2033-164916-0004	Then he added, "'Oh, my uncle, how shall I do with my brother Sharkan?'
2033-164916-0005	After a while the dust dispersed, And there appeared under it The army of Baghdad and Khorasan, A conquering host like the pool-tide sea. And Sharazad perceived the dawn of day, And ceased to say her permitted say.
2033-164916-0006	When it was the 78th night,
2033-164916-0007	And in it all rejoiced at the accession of the light of the place.
2033-164916-0008	lastly the minister went in and kissed the ground before zaal makan who rose to meet him saying welcome o wazir and sire's son's peer
2033-164916-0009	moreover the sultan commanded his wazir dandan call a ten days halt of the army that he might be private with him and learn from him how and wherefore his father had been slain
2033-164916-0010	He then repaired to the heart of the encampment, And ordered the host to halt ten days.
2414-128291-0000	what hath happened unto me
2414-128291-0001	he asked himself something warm and living quickeneth me it must be in thy neighborhood
2414-128291-0002	when however the tustra was quite nigh unto them then did he hear plainly that human voice speak in the midst of the kine and apparently all of them had turned their heads towards the speaker
2414-128291-0003	What do I here seek?
2414-128291-0004	answered he the same that thou seekest thou mischief-maker that is to say happiness upon earth
2414-128291-0005	for i tell thee that i have already talked half a morning unto them and just now were they about to give me their answer

2414-128291-0014	Why dost thou tempt me?
2414-128291-0015	Answered the other.
2414-128291-0016	Thou knowest it thyself better even than I.
2414-128291-0017	thus begged the peaceful one and puffed himself and perspired with his words so that the kind wondered anew
2414-128291-0018	thou doest violence to thyself thou preacher on the mount and thou usest such savoury words
2414-128291-0019	They also abstain from all heavy thoughts which inflate the heart.

2414-128292-0003	Let it run after me. I run away from it.
2414-128292-0004	Thus begged the two strike to his heart and ran away.
2414-128292-0005	Verily my folly hath grown big in the mountains.
2414-128292-0006	Now do I hear six old fools' legs rattling behind one another?
2414-128292-0007	But Doth's Artustra need to be frightened by his shadow.
2414-128292-0008	Also, methink it that after all it hath longer legs than mine.
2414-128292-0009	who when their twistress scrutinized him with his glance he was frightened as by a sudden apparition so slender swarthy hollow and worn out did his follower appear
2414-128292-0010	As I twister vehemently, What doest thou here?
2414-128292-0011	And why callest thou thyself my shadow?
2414-128292-0012	Thou art not pleasing unto me.
2414-128292-0013	Must I ever be on the way?
2414-128292-0014	O earth, thou hast become too round for me.
2414-128292-0015	When the devil casteth his skin, doth not his name also fall away? It is also skin.

2414-128292-0017	sometimes i am meant to lie and behold

2414-128292-0019	How have I still inclination?
2414-128292-0020	Have I still a goal?
2414-128292-0021	I have endorsed which my sale is set.
2414-128292-0022	For it too I ask and seek, and have sought, but have not found it.
2414-128292-0023	O eternal everywhere! O eternal nowhere! O eternal in vain!
2414-128292-0024	Thou art my shadow.
2414-128292-0025	said he at last sadly

2414-159411-0000	once upon a time a brahmin who was walking along the road came upon an iron cage in which a great tiger had been shut up by the villagers who caught him
2414-159411-0001	The Brahmin answered, No, I will not, for if I let you out of the cage, you will eat me.
2414-159411-0002	oh father of mercy answered the tiger in truth that i will not
2414-159411-0003	i will never be so ungrateful only let me out that i may drink some water and return
2414-159411-0004	then the brahmin took pity on him and opened the cage door but no sooner had he turned so that the tiger jumping out said now i will eat you first and drink the water afterwards
2414-159411-0005	so the brahmin and the tiger walked on till they came to a banyan tree and the brahmin said to it banyan tree banyan tree hear and give judgment
2414-159411-0006	On what must I give judgment? asked the banyan tree.
2414-159411-0007	this tiger said the brahmin begged me to let him out of his cage to drink a little water and he promised not to hurt me if i did so but now that i have left him out he wishes to eat me
2414-159411-0008	It is just that he should do so or no.
2414-159411-0009	Let the tiger eat the man, for men are an ungrateful race.
2414-159411-0010	sir campbell sir campbell cried the brahmin hear and give judgment
2414-159411-0011	At a little distance they found a bullock lying by the roadside.
2414-159411-0012	Is it fair that he should do so or not?
2414-159411-0013	Let the tiger eat the man, for men have no pity.
2414-159411-0014	three out of the six and giving judgment against the brahman but still he did not lose all hope and determined to ask the other three
2414-159411-0015	On what must I give judgment? asked the eagle.
2414-159411-0016	the brahman seated the case and the eagle answered whenever men see me they try to shoot me they climb the rocks and steal away my little ones
2414-159411-0017	Then the tiger began to roar and said, Judgment of all is against you, O Brahmin.
2414-159411-0018	after this they saw an alligator and the brahman related the matter to him hoping for a more favorable verdict
2414-159411-0019	but the alligator said whenever i put my nose out of the water men torment me and try to kill me
2414-159411-0020	the brahman gave himself up as lost but again he prayed the tiger to have patience and let him ask the opinion of the sixth judge
2414-159411-0021	On the 6th was a jackal.
2414-159411-0022	the brahmin told his story and said to him uncle jacko uncle jacko say what is your judgment
2414-159411-0023	Show me the place.
2414-159411-0024	when they got there the jackals said now brahman show me exactly where you stood
2414-159411-0025	"'Exactly there, was it?' asked the jackal.
2414-159411-0026	exactly here replied the Brahmin
2414-159411-0027	Where was the tiger then?
2414-159411-0028	why i stood so said the tiger jumping into the cage and my head was on this side
2414-159411-0029	very good said the jacko but i cannot judge without understanding the whole matter exactly
2414-159411-0030	Shat and bolted, said the Brahmin.
2414-159411-0031	"'Then shut and bolted,' said the jackal.
2414-159411-0032	when the brahmin had done this the jackal said oh you wicked and ungrateful tiger
2414-159411-0033	When a good Brahmin opened your cage door, is to eat him the only return you would make?
2414-159411-0034	Proceed on your journey, friend Raman.
2414-159411-0035	Your road lies that way and mine this.

2609-156975-0005	The absence of detailed reference to the Hebrews is therefore perfectly natural.
2609-156975-0006	it seems probable that not all but only part of the tribes which ultimately collides into the hebrew nation find their way to egypt
2609-156975-0007	the stories regarding joseph their traditional father ephraim and manasseh imply that these strong central tribes possibly together with the southern tribes of benjamin and judah were the chief actors in this opening scene in israel's history

2609-169640-0003	I never was in a better stearingship, most especially in moderate weather.
2609-169640-0004	mr marble he ought to be was fairly snoozing on the hinkoops being like the cells as one might say very asleep
2609-169640-0005	At that moment I heard a noise, when familiar to seamen, that of an oar falling in a boat.
2609-169640-0006	i sing it sail ho and close abroad
2609-169640-0007	he was too much of a seaman to require a second look in order to ascertain what was to be done
2609-169640-0008	Although they went three feet to our two, this gave us a moment of breathing time.
2609-169640-0009	As our seats were all flying forward, and remained so for a few minutes, it gave me a leisure to look about.
2609-169640-0010	I soon saw both prongs, and quite enough was I to perceive that they had not approached materially nearer.
2609-169640-0011	mr kite observed this also and remarked that our movements had been so prompt as to take the rascals aback
2609-169640-0012	A breath of its stillness seceded.
2609-169640-0013	the prowess did not alter the course but neared us fast
2609-169640-0014	i heard the rattling of the boarding-pipes too as they were cut adrift from the spanker-boom and fell upon the decks
2609-169640-0015	Kite went out and returned with three or four muskets and as many pikes.
2609-169640-0016	The stillness that reigned on both sides was like that of death.
2609-169640-0017	The giant behaved beautifully and came round like a top.
2609-169640-0018	The question was now whether we could pass them or not before they got near enough to grapple.
2609-169640-0019	The captain behaved perfectly well in this critical instance, commanding a dead silence in the closest attention to his orders.
2609-169640-0020	I'm so on board the John was hurt
2609-169640-0021	on our side we gave the gentlemen the four sixes two at the nearest and two at the sternmost proa which was still near a cable's length
2609-169640-0022	They were like the elves of fiends and anguished.
2609-169640-0023	I doubt if we touch the man in the nearest prairie.
2609-169640-0024	This state, the ship passed ahead, all of her canvas been full, leaving the pro-emotionals in her wake.
3005-163389-0000	they swarmed up in front of sherburne's palings as thick as they could jam together and you couldn't hear yourself think for the noise
3005-163389-0001	Some sung out, tear down the fence, tear down the fence.
3005-163389-0002	The stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable.
3005-163389-0003	sherburne run his eyes slow along the crowd and wherever it struck the people tried a little to outgaze him but they couldn't they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky
3005-163389-0004	The average man's a coward.
3005-163389-0005	because they're afraid the man's friends will shoot them in the back in the dark and it's just what they would do
3005-163389-0006	so they always acquit and then a man goes in the night with a hundred masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal
3005-163389-0007	You didn't want to come.
3005-163389-0008	but a mob without any man at the head of it is beneath pitifulness
3005-163389-0009	now leave and take your half a man with you tossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking it when he says this
3005-163389-0010	the crowd washed back sudden and then broke all apart and went tearing off every which way and buck harkness he heeled it after them looking tolerable cheap
3005-163389-0011	You can't be too careful.
3005-163389-0012	They argued and tried to keep him out, but he wouldn't listen, and the whole show would come to a standstill.
3005-163389-0013	And one or two women began to scream.
3005-163389-0014	so then the ringmaster he made a little speech and said he hoped there wouldn't be no disturbance and if the man would promise he wouldn't make no more trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse
3005-163389-0015	It warn't funny to me, though. I was all of a-tremble to see his danger.
3005-163389-0016	And the horse a-going like a house afire, too.
3005-163389-0017	He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up the air, and altogether he shed seventeen suits.
3005-163389-0018	Why, it was one of his own men.
3005-163390-0000	And, but never mind the rest of his outfit, it was just wild, but it was awful funny.
3005-163390-0001	the people most killed themselves laughing and when the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes they roared and clapped and stormed and ha haed till he come back and done it over again and after that they made him do it another time
3005-163390-0002	20 people sings out.
3005-163390-0003	The Duke says, yes.
3005-163390-0004	Everybody sings out, sold!
3005-163390-0005	But a big, fine-looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts, Hold on!
3005-163390-0006	Just a word, gentlemen. They stopped to listen.
3005-163390-0007	What we want is to go out of here quiet and talk this show up and sell the rest of the town.
3005-163390-0008	You bet it is. The judge is right, everybody sings out.
3005-163390-0009	we struck the raft at the same time and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream all dark and still and edging towards the middle of the river nobody saying a word
3005-163390-0010	We never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village.
3005-163390-0011	greenhorns, flatheads,
3005-163390-0012	No, I says it don't.
3005-163390-0013	well it don't because it's in the breed i reckon they're all alike
3005-163390-0014	Well, that's what I'm a-sayin'. All kings is mostly rapscallions, as fur as I can make out. Is dat so?
3005-163390-0015	and look at charles second and louis fourteen and louis fifteen and james second and edward second and richard third and forty more besides all them saxon heptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise
3005-163390-0016	my you ought to seen old henry the eighth when he was in bloom he was a blossom
3005-163390-0017	Ring up Fair Rosamond.
3005-163390-0018	Well, Henry, he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country.
3005-163390-0019	"'S'pose he opened his mouth. What then?'
3005-163390-0020	All I say is, kings is kings, and you got to make allowances.
3005-163390-0021	Take them all around. They're a mighty ornery lot. It's the way they're raised.
3005-163390-0022	"'Well, they all do, Jim.'
3005-163390-0023	now de duke he's a tolerable like the man in some ways
3005-163390-0024	This one's a middling hard lot for a duke.
3005-163390-0025	when i waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with his head down betwixt his knees moaning and moaning to himself
3005-163390-0026	It don't seem natural, but I reckon it so.
3005-163390-0027	he was often moaning and mourning that way nights when he judged i was asleep and saying poor little elizabeth
3005-163390-0028	Don't you hear me? Shut the door.
3005-163390-0029	I lay I make you mine.
3005-163390-0030	Just as loud as I could yell.
3005-163391-0000	which was sound enough judgment but you take the average man and he wouldn't wait for him to howl
3005-163391-0001	The king's duds was all black, and he did look real swell and starchy.
3005-163391-0002	why before he looked like the orneriest old rip that ever was but now when he'd take off his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile he looked that grand and good and pious that you'd say he had walked right out of the ark and maybe was old leviticus himself
3005-163391-0003	Jim cleaned up the canoe and I got my paddle ready.
3005-163391-0004	Where are you bound for, young man?
3005-163391-0005	"'Get aboard,' says the king."
3005-163391-0006	I done so, and then we all three started on again.
3005-163391-0007	the young chap was mighty thankful said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather
3005-163391-0008	he asked the king where he was going and the king told him he'd come down the river and landed at the other village this morning and now he was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there the young fellow says
3005-163391-0009	but then i says again no i reckon it ain't him or else he wouldn't be paddling up the river you ain't him are you
3005-163391-0010	no my name's blodgett alexander blodgett reverend alexander blodgett i s'pose i must say as i'm one of the lard's poor servants
3005-163391-0011	you see he was pretty old and george's g'yurls was too young to be much company for him except mary jane the red-headed one and so he was kinder lonesome after george and his wife died and didn't seem to care much to live
3005-163391-0012	Too bad, too bad he couldn't have lived to see his brothers, poor soul.
3005-163391-0013	I'm going in a ship next Wednesday for Rio de Janeiro, where my uncle lives.
3005-163391-0014	But it'll be lovely. Wish I was a-going.
3005-163391-0015	mary jane's nineteen susan's fifteen and joanna's about fourteen that's the one that gives herself to good works and has a hare lip poor things
3005-163391-0016	"'Well, they could be worse off.'
3005-163391-0017	Old Peter had friends, and they ain't gonna let them come to no harm.
3005-163391-0018	blamed if he didn't inquire about everybody and everything in that blessed town and all about the wilkeses and about peter's business which was a tanner and about george's which was a carpenter and about harvey's which was a dissentering minister and so on and so on then he says
3005-163391-0019	When they're deep, they won't stop for a hail.
3005-163391-0020	Was Peter Wilkes well off?
3005-163391-0021	When we struck the boat she was about done loading, and pretty soon she got off.
3005-163391-0022	Now hustle back right off and fetch the duke up here and the new carpet bags
3005-163391-0023	So then they waited for a steamboat.
3005-163391-0024	But the king was calm. He says,
3005-163391-0025	they give a glance at one another and nodded their heads as much as to say would they tell you
3005-163391-0026	Then one of them says, kind of soft and gentle,
3005-163399-0000	phelps's was one of these little one-horse cotton plantations and they all look alike
3005-163399-0001	I went around and climbed over the back stile by the ash hopper and started for the kitchen.
3005-163399-0002	i out with a yes umfore i thought
3005-163399-0003	So then she started for the house, leading me by the hand, and the children tagging after.
3005-163399-0004	when we got there she set me down in a split-bottomed chair and set herself down on a little low stool in front of me holding both of my hands and says
3005-163399-0005	Well, it's lucky because sometimes people do get hurt.
3005-163399-0006	and I think he died afterwards. He was a Baptist.
3005-163399-0007	Yes, it was mortification. That was it.
3005-163399-0008	Your uncle's been up to town every day to fetch you.
3005-163399-0009	you must have met him on the road didn't you oldish man with a
3005-163399-0010	Why, child, it'll be stole.
3005-163399-0011	It was kinder thin ice, but I says,
3005-163399-0012	i had my mind on the children all the time i wanted to get them out to one side and pump them a little and find out who i was
3005-163399-0013	Pretty soon she made the cold chills streak all down my back because she says,
3005-163399-0014	I see it weren't a bit of use to try to go ahead. I'd got to throw up my hand.
3005-163399-0015	So I says to myself, here's another place where I got to rest the truth.
3005-163399-0016	i opened my mouth to begin but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed and says here he comes
3005-163399-0017	Children, don't you say a word.
3005-163399-0018	I see I was in a fix now.
3005-163399-0019	Mrs. Phelps, she jumps for him and says...
3005-163399-0020	"'Has he come?' "'No,' says her husband.
3005-163399-0021	I can't imagine, says the old gentleman, and I must say it makes me dreadful uneasy.
3005-163399-0022	"'Uneasy,' she says. "'I'm ready to go distracted.'
3005-163399-0023	He must have come, and you've missed him along the road.
3005-163399-0024	Oh, don't distress me any more than I'm already distressed.
3005-163399-0025	"'Why, Silas, look yonder, up the road. Ain't that somebody coming?'
3005-163399-0026	The old gentleman stared and says,
3005-163399-0027	I ain't no idea. Who is it?
3005-163399-0028	It's Tom Sawyer.
3005-163399-0029	Being Tom Sawyer was easy and comfortable, and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by I hear a steamboat coughing along down the river.
3005-163399-0030	Then I says to myself, "'Spose Tom Sawyer comes down on that boat.'"
3080-5032-0000	"'But I am hugely pleased that you have seen my lady.'
3080-5032-0001	I knew you could not choose but like her. But yet let me tell you, you have seen but the worst of her.
3080-5032-0002	her conversation has more charms than can be in mere beauty and her humor and disposition would make a deformed person appear lovely
3080-5032-0003	"'Why did you not send me that news? "'And a garland?'
3080-5032-0004	Well, the best on it is that I have a squire now that is as good as a knight.
3080-5032-0005	In earnest, we have had such a skirmish, and upon so foolish an occasion, as I cannot tell which is stranger's.
3080-5032-0006	all the people that i had ever in my life refused were brought again upon the stage like richard the third's ghosts to reproach me withal and all the kindness his discoveries could make i had for you was laid to my charge
3080-5032-0007	my best qualities if i have any that are good served but for aggravations of my fault and i was allowed to have wit and understanding and discretion in other things that it might appear i had none in this
3080-5032-0008	It is a strange change, and I am very sorry for it, but I'll swear I know not how to help it.
3080-5032-0009	mr fish is a squire of dames and has so many mistresses that anybody may pretend to share in him and be believed but though i have the honour to be his near neighbour to speak freely i cannot brag much that he makes any court to me and i know no young woman in the country that he does not visit often
3080-5032-0010	"'I think my youngest brother comes down with him.'
3080-5032-0011	i can no sooner give you some little hints whereabout they live but you know them presently and i meant you should be beholding to me for your acquaintance
3080-5032-0012	but it seems this gentleman is not so easy access but you may acknowledge something due to me if i incline him to look graciously upon you and therefore there is not much harm done
3080-5032-0013	i have missed four fits and have had but five and have recovered so much strength as made me venture to meet your letter on wednesday a mile from home
3080-5032-0014	But, besides, I can give you others.
3080-5032-0015	i am here much more out of people's way than in town where my aunt and such as pretend an interest in me and a power over me do so persecute me with their good nature and take it so ill that they are not accepted as i would live in a hollow tree to avoid them
3080-5032-0016	You would think him altered and, if it be possible, more melancholy than he was.
3080-5032-0017	If marriage agrees no better with other people than it does with him, I shall pray that all my friends may escape it.
3080-5032-0018	well in earnest if i were a prince that lady should be my mistress but i can give no rule to any one else and perhaps those that are in no danger of losing their hearts to her may be infinitely taken with one i should not value at all
3080-5032-0019	the matter is not great for i confess i do naturally hate the noise and talk of the world and should be best pleased never to be known in it upon any occasion whatsoever yet since it can never be wholly avoided one must satisfy oneself by doing nothing that one need care who knows
3080-5032-0020	If I had a picture that would fit for you, you should have it.
3080-5032-0021	How can you talk of defying fortune? Nobody lives without it. And therefore, why should you imagine you could?
3080-5032-0022	i know not how my brother comes to be so well informed as you say but i am certain he knows the utmost of the injuries you have received from her
3080-5032-0023	We have had another debate, but much more calmly.
3080-5032-0024	and besides there was a time when we ourselves were indifferent to one another did i do so then or have i learned it since
3080-5032-0025	I have been studying how Tom Cheek might come by his intelligence, and I very believe he has it from my cousin, Peter's.
3080-5032-0026	How kindly do I take the civilities of your father's. In earnest, you cannot imagine how his letter pleased me.
3080-5040-0000	Would it would leave me and then I could believe I shall not always have occasion for it.
3080-5040-0001	my poor lady vavasor is carried to the tower and her great belly could not excuse her because she was acquainted by somebody that there was a plot against the protector and did not discover it
3080-5040-0002	she has told now all that was told her but vows she will never say from whence she had it we shall see whether her resolutions are as unalterable as those of my lady
3080-5040-0003	I wonder how she behaved herself when she was married.
3080-5040-0004	i never saw any one yet that did not look simply and out of countenance nor ever knew a wedding well designed but one and that was of two persons who had time enough i confess to contrive it and nobody to please in but themselves
3080-5040-0005	The truth is, I could not endure to be Mrs. Bride in a public wedding, to be made the happiest person on earth.
3080-5040-0006	do not take it ill for i would endure it if i could rather than fail but in earnest i do not think it were possible for me
3080-5040-0007	yet in earnest your father will not find my brother peyton wanting in civility though he is not a man of much compliment unless it be in his letters to me nor an unreasonable person in anything so he will allow him out of his kindness to his wife to set a higher value upon her sister than she deserves
3080-5040-0008	my aunt told me no longer gone than yesterday that i was the most wilful woman that ever she knew and had an obstinacy of spirit nothing could overcome take heed
3080-5040-0009	You see, I give you fair warning.
3080-5040-0010	by the next i shall be gone into kent and my other journey is laid aside which i am not displeased at because it would have broken our intercourse very much
3080-5040-0011	Here are some verses of Kaoli's. Tell me how you like them.
3080-5040-0012	I told you in my last that my Suffolk journey was laid aside, and that into Kent hastened.
3080-5040-0013	if i drown by the way this will be my last letter and like a will i bequeath all my kindness to you in it with a charge never to bestow it all upon another mistress lest my ghost rise again and haunt you
3080-5040-0014	indeed i like him extremely and he is commended to me by people that know him very well and are able to judge for a most excellent servant and faithful as possible
3080-5040-0015	Because you find fault with my other letters, this is like to be shorter than they. I did not intend it so though, I can assure you.
3080-5040-0016	I do not find her, though I am told I was so extremely when I believed you loved me.
3080-5040-0017	But I am called upon.
3080-5040-0018	Directed for your master.
3080-5040-0019	i see you can chid when you please and with authority but i deserve it i confess and all i can say for myself is that my fault proceeded from a very good principle in me
3080-5040-0020	We dare not let our tongues lie more on one side of our mouths than the other for fear of overturning it.
3080-5040-0021	"'You are satisfied, I hope. "'At this that I escape drowning?'
3080-5040-0022	but i am troubled much you should make so ill a journey to so little purpose indeed i writ by the first post after my arrival here and cannot imagine how you came to miss of my letters
3080-5040-0023	How welcome you will be! But alas!
3080-5040-0024	for my life i cannot beat into their heads a passion that must be subject to no decay an even perfect kindness that must last perpetually without the least intermission
3080-5040-0025	they laughed to hear me say that one unkind word would destroy all the satisfaction of my life and that i should expect our kindness should increase every day if it were possible but never lessen
3080-5040-0026	We go abroad all day and play all night and say our prayers when we have time.
3080-5040-0027	well in sober earnest now i would not lift as a twelvemonth to gain all that the king has lost unless it were to give it him again
3080-5040-0028	Will you be so good-natured?
3080-5040-0029	he has one son and tis the finest boy that e'er you saw and has a noble spirit but yet stands in that awe of his father that one word from him is as much as twenty whippings
3080-5040-0030	You must give me leave to entertain you thus with discourses of the family, for I can tell you nothing else from hence.
3080-5040-0031	not to know when you would come home i can assure you nor for any other occasion of my own but with a cousin of mine that had long designed to make herself sport with him and did not miss of her aim
3080-5040-0032	in my life i never heard so ridiculous a discourse as he made us and no old woman who passes for a witch could have been more puzzled to seek what to say to reasonable people than he was
3080-5040-0033	ever since this adventure i have had so great a belief in all things of this nature that i could not forbear laying a pease-cart with nine peas in't under my door yesterday and was informed by it that my husband's name should be thomas how do you like that
3331-159605-0000	she pulled her hair down turned her skirt back put her feet on the fender and took partle into her lap all of which arrangements signified that something very important had got to be thought over and settled
3331-159605-0001	The more proposals, the more credit.
3331-159605-0002	I've tried it, and liked it, and maybe this is the consequence of that night's fun.
3331-159605-0003	Just suppose it is true that he does ask me and I say yes.
3331-159605-0004	What a spiteful thing I am.
3331-159605-0005	I could do so much for all at home, how I should enjoy that.
3331-159605-0006	Let me see, how can I begin?
3331-159605-0007	He has known her all her life and has a good influence over her.
3331-159605-0008	now as polly was by no means a perfect creature i am free to confess that the old temptation assailed her more than once that week for when the first excitement of the dodging reform had subsided she missed the pleasant little interviews that used to put a certain flavor of romance into her dull hard-working days
3331-159605-0009	I don't think it was his wealth, accomplishments or position that most attracted Polly, though these doubtless possessed a greater influence than she suspected.
3331-159605-0010	It was that indescribable something which women are quick to see and feel in men who have been blessed with wise and good mothers.
3331-159605-0011	This had an especial charm to Polly, for she soon found that this side of his character was not shown to everyone.
3331-159605-0012	Lately, this had changed, especially towards Polly, and it flattered her more than she would confess even to herself.
3331-159605-0013	At first she tried to think she could, but unfortunately hearts are so contrary that they won't be obedient to reason, will or even gratitude.
3331-159605-0014	polly felt a very cordial friendship for mr sydney but not one particle of the love which is the only coin in which love can be truly paid
3331-159605-0015	this finished polly's indecision and after that night she never allowed herself to dwell upon the pleasant temptation which came in a guise particularly attractive to a young girl with the spice of the old eve in her composition
3331-159605-0016	when saturday came polly started as usual for a visit to becky and bess but could not resist stopping at the shores to leave a little parcel for fan though it was calling time
3331-159605-0017	A foolish little speech to make to a dog, but you see, Polly was only a tender-hearted girl, trying to do her duty.
3331-159605-0018	"'Take hold of Master Charlie's hand, Miss Mamie, and walk pretty like Willie and Flossie,' said the maid."
3331-159605-0019	At a street corner, a black-eyed schoolboy was parting from a rosy-faced schoolgirl, whose music role he was reluctantly surrendering.
3331-159605-0020	how he got there was never very clear to polly but there he was flushed and a little out of breath but looking so glad to see her till she had not the heart to be stiff and cool as she had fully intended to be when they met
3331-159605-0021	She really could not help it. It was so pleasant to see him again, just when she was feeling so lonely.
3331-159605-0022	"'That is the way I get to the Ross,' answered Polly."
3331-159605-0023	She did not mean to tell, but his frankness was so agreeable she forgot herself.
3331-159605-0024	But I know her better, and I assure you that she does improve. She tries to mend her thoughts, though she won't own it, and will surprise you someday by the amount of heart and sense and goodness she has got.
3331-159605-0025	Thank you. No.
3331-159605-0026	"'How lovely the park looks,' she said in great confusion.'
3331-159605-0027	asked the artful young man, laying a trap into which Polly immediately fell.
3331-159605-0028	he was quicker to take a hint than she had expected and being both proud and generous resolved to settle the matter at once for polly's sake as well as his own
3331-159605-0029	so when she made her last buoyant remark he said quietly watching her face keenly all the while i thought so well i'm going out of town on business for several weeks so you can enjoy your little bit of country without being annoyed by me annoyed
3331-159605-0030	she thought she had a good deal of the coquette in her and i have no doubt that with time and training she would have become a very dangerous little person but now she was far too transparent and straightforward by nature even to tell a wild-like
3331-159605-0031	he was gone before she could do anything but look up at him with a remorseful face and she walked on feeling that the first and perhaps the only lover she would ever have had read his answer and accepted it in silence
3331-159605-0032	polly did not return to her favorite walk till she learned from minnie that the uncle had really left town and then she found that his friendly company and conversation was what had made the way so pleasant after all
3331-159605-0033	Working two and four as usual? What's the news with you?
3331-159605-0034	Perhaps she'll children.
3331-159605-0035	Utterly done with and laid upon the shelf,
3331-159605-0036	Minnie said the other day she wished she was a pigeon so she could paddle in the puddles and not fuss about rivers.
3331-159605-0037	"'Now don't be affected, Polly, but just tell me, like a dear, has not he proposed?'
3331-159605-0038	Don't you think he means to?
3331-159605-0039	Truly, truly fan.
3331-159605-0040	I don't mean to be prying, but I really thought he did.
3331-159605-0041	Well, I always meant to try it if I got a chance, and I have.
3331-159605-0042	I just gave him a hint and he took it.
3331-159605-0043	He meant to go away before that, so don't think his heart is broken, or mind what silly Tatlas say.
3331-159605-0044	He understood, and being a gentleman made no fuss.
3331-159605-0045	But, Polly, it would have been a grand thing for you.
3331-159605-0046	I'm odd, you know, and prefer to be an independent spinster and teach music all my days.
3331-159609-0000	never mind what the business was it suffices to say that it was a good beginning for a young man like tom who having been born and bred in the most conservative class of the most conceited city in new england needed just the healthy hearty social influences of the west to widen his views and make a man of him
3331-159609-0001	fortunately every one was so busy with the necessary preparations that there was no time for romance of any sort and the four young people worked together as soberly and sensibly as if all sorts of emotions were not bottled up in their respective hearts
3331-159609-0002	pity that the end should come so soon but the hour did its work and went its way leaving a clearer atmosphere behind though the young folks did not see it then for their eyes were dim because of the partings that must be
3331-159609-0003	if it had not been for two things i fear she never would have stood a summer in town but sidney often called till his vacation came and a voluminous correspondence with polly beguiled the long days
3331-159609-0004	tom wrote once a week to his mother but the letters were short and not very satisfactory for men never do tell the interesting little things that women best like to hear
3331-159609-0005	now i am only tired had a good deal to do lately and the dull weather makes me just a travel
3331-159609-0006	forgive me polly but i can't help saying it for it is there and i want to be as true to you as you were to me if i can
3331-159609-0007	I try not to deceive myself, but it does seem as if there was a chance of happiness for me.
3331-159609-0008	Thank heaven for that!
3331-159609-0009	cried Polly with the heartiest satisfaction in her voice.
3331-159609-0010	Poor Polly was so taken by surprise that she had not a word to say.
3331-159609-0011	none were needed her talty face answered for her as well as the impulse which made her hide her head in the sofa cushion like a foolish ostrich when the hunters are after it
3331-159609-0012	once or twice but sort of jokingly and i thought it was only some little flirtation
3331-159609-0013	It was so stupid of me not to guess before.
3331-159609-0014	it was so tender earnest and defiant that fanny forgot the defence of her own lover in admiration of polly's loyalty to hers for this faithful all-absorbing love was a new revelation to fanny who was used to hearing her friends boast of two or three lovers a year and calculate their respective values with almost as much coolness as the young men discussed the fortunes of the girls they wished for but could not afford to marry
3331-159609-0015	i hope maria bailey is only thinks her she added softly for i could not bear to have him disappointed again
3331-159609-0016	said Fanny, turning hopeful all at once.
3331-159609-0017	suppose i say a word to tom just inquire after his heart in a general way you know and give him a chance to tell me if there's anything to tell
3331-159609-0018	bear it people always do bear things somehow answered polly looking as if sentence had been passed upon her
3331-159609-0019	It was a very different winter from the last for both the girls.
3331-159609-0020	if fanny wanted to show him what she could do toward making a pleasant home she certainly succeeded better than she suspected for in spite of many failures and discouragements behind the scenes the little house became a most attractive place to mr sidney at least for he was more the house friend than ever and seemed determined to prove that change of fortune made no difference to him
3331-159609-0021	she kept much at home when the day's work was done finding it pleasanter to sit dreaming of a book or sewing alone than to exert herself even to go to the shores
3331-159609-0022	polly was not at all like herself that winter and those nearest to her saw and wondered at it most
3331-159609-0023	for ned was so absorbed in business that he ignored the whole bailey question and left them in utter darkness
3331-159609-0024	fanny came walking in upon her one day looking as if she brought hidings of such great joy that she hardly knew how to tell them
3331-159609-0025	but if work-baskets were gifted with powers of speech they could tell stories more true and tender than any we read
3528-168656-0000	She had even been in society before the revolution.
3528-168656-0001	It was her pleasure and her vanity to drag in these names on every pretext.
3528-168656-0002	every year she solemnly renewed her vows and at the moment of taking the oath she said to the priest monseigneur saint franois gave it to monseigneur saint julien monseigneur saint julien gave it to monseigneur saint eusebius monseigneur saint eusebius gave it to monseigneur saint procopius c c
3528-168656-0003	and the schoolgirls would begin to laugh not in their sleeves but under their veils charming little stifled laughs which made the vocal mothers frown
3528-168656-0004	It was a century which spoke through her, but it was the eighteenth century.
3528-168656-0005	The ruler of Fontrevaux did not forbid this.
3528-168656-0006	She would not show this object to anyone.
3528-168656-0007	Thus it furnished a subject of comment for all those who were unoccupied or bored in the convent.
3528-168656-0008	some unique chaplet, some authentic relic,
3528-168656-0009	They lost themselves in conjectures.
3528-168656-0010	when the poor old woman died they rushed to her cupboard more hastily than was fitting perhaps and opened it
3528-168656-0011	he is resisting fluttering his tiny wings and still making an effort to fly but the dancer is laughing with a satanical air
3528-168656-0012	Moral, love conquered by the colic.
3528-168669-0000	The prioress returned, and seated herself once more on her chair.
3528-168669-0001	We will present a stenographic report of the dialogue which then ensued, to the best of our ability.
3528-168669-0002	Father Fauvent.
3528-168669-0003	"'Reverend Mother, do you know the chapel?'
3528-168669-0004	"'And you have been in the choir in pursuance of your duties?' "'Two or three times.'
3528-168669-0005	"'There is a stone to be raised.' "'Heavy?'
3528-168669-0006	the slab of the pavement, which is at the side of the altar.
3528-168669-0007	"'The slab which closes the vault?' "'Yes.'
3528-168669-0008	"'It would be a good thing to have two men for it.'
3528-168669-0009	"'A woman is never a man.'
3528-168669-0010	because dom maboulon gives four hundred and seventeen epistles of st bernard while merlonus horcius only gives three hundred and sixty-seven i do not despise merlonus horcius neither do i
3528-168669-0011	Marriage consists in working according to one's strength. A cloister is not a dockyard.
3528-168669-0012	"'And a woman is not a man, but my brother is a strong one, though.'
3528-168669-0013	"'And can you get a lever?'
3528-168669-0014	There is a ring in the stone.
3528-168669-0015	I will put the lever through it.
3528-168669-0016	"'That is good, Reverend Mother. I will open the vault.'
3528-168669-0017	Will that be all? No.
3528-168669-0018	"'Give me your orders, very reverend mother.'
3528-168669-0019	Fouvent, we have confidence in you.
3528-168669-0020	I am here to do anything you wish.
3528-168669-0021	and to hold your peace about everything. Yes, Reverend Mother.
3528-168669-0022	When the vault is open, I will close it again.
3528-168669-0023	"'But before that—' "'What, Reverend Mother?'
3528-168669-0024	Father Fouvent. Reverend Mother.
3528-168669-0025	You know that a mother died this morning.
3528-168669-0026	"'No.' "'Did you not hear the bell?'
3528-168669-0027	"'Nothing can be heard at the bottom of the garden.' "'Really?'
3528-168669-0028	"'And then the wind is not blowing in my direction this morning.'
3528-168669-0029	It was Mother Crucifixion.
3528-168669-0030	Three years ago, Madame de Besson, a Jansenist, turned Orthodox, merely from having seen Mother Crucifixion at prayer. Ah!
3528-168669-0031	"'The mothers have taken her to the dead-room which opens on the church.' "'I know.'
3528-168669-0032	A fine sight it would be to see a man enter the dead room. More often.
3528-168669-0033	Hey, more often.
3528-168669-0034	What do you say?
3528-168669-0035	I say more often. More often than what?
3528-168669-0036	"'Reverend Mother, I did not say more often than what I said more often.'
3528-168669-0037	But I did not say more often.
3528-168669-0038	At that moment, nine o'clock struck.
3528-168669-0039	At nine o'clock in the morning, and at all hours, praised and adored be the most holy sacrament of the altar, said the prioress.
3528-168669-0040	It cut more often short.
3528-168669-0041	Foshlevont mopped his forehead.
3528-168669-0042	In her lifetime, Mother Crucifixion made converts. After her death, she will perform miracles. She will?
3528-168669-0043	Father Fouvent, the community has been blessed in Mother Crucifixion.
3528-168669-0044	She retained her consciousness to the very last moment.
3528-168669-0045	"'She gave us her last commands.'
3528-168669-0046	If you had a little more faith, and if you could have been in her cell, she would have cured your leg merely by touching it. She smiled.
3528-168669-0047	There was something of paradise in that death.
3528-168669-0048	Fauchelmont thought that it was an orison which she was finishing.
3528-168669-0049	Fauchelevent held his peace. She went on.
3528-168669-0050	i have consulted upon this point many ecclesiastics laboring in our lord who occupy themselves in the exercises of the clerical life and who bear wonderful fruit
3528-168669-0051	Fortunately, the Prioress, completely absorbed in her own thoughts, did not hear it.
3528-168669-0052	She continued. For the fervent...
3528-168669-0053	Yes, Reverend Mother.
3528-168669-0054	st terentius bishop of port where the mouth of the tiber empties into the sea requested that on his tomb might be engraved the sign which was placed on the graves of parricides in the hope that passers-by would spit on his tomb this was done
3528-168669-0055	The dead must be obeyed. So be it.
3528-168669-0056	"'For that matter, no, Reverend Mother.'
3528-168669-0057	father fervent mother crucifixion will be interred in the coffin in which she has slept for the last twenty years that is just
3528-168669-0058	It is a continuation of her slumber.
3528-168669-0059	"'So I shall have to nail up that coffin?' "'Yes.'
3528-168669-0060	I am at the orders of the very reverend community.
3528-168669-0061	The four mother presenters will assist you.
3528-168669-0062	"'No, in lowering the coffin.'
3528-168669-0063	"'Where?' "'Into the vault.'
3528-168669-0064	Fauchelevent started. The vault under the altar?
3528-168669-0065	under the altar. But...
3528-168669-0066	"'You will have an iron bar.' "'Yes, but—'
3528-168669-0067	You will raise the stone with the bar by means of the ring. But...
3528-168669-0068	the dead must be obeyed to be buried in the vault under the altar of the chapel not to go to profane earth to remain there in death where she prayed while living such was the last wish of mother crucifixion
3528-168669-0069	She asked it of us, that is to say, commanded us.
3528-168669-0070	But it is forbidden.
3528-168669-0071	"'Oh, I am a stone in your walls.'
3528-168669-0072	Think, Father Fauvin, if she were to work miracles here.
3528-168669-0073	What a glory of God for the community, and miracles issue from tombs.
3528-168669-0074	"'But, Reverend Mother, if the agent of the Sanitary Commission—'
3528-168669-0075	But the Commissary of Police...
3528-168669-0076	chaulodemer one of the seven german kings who entered among the gauls under the empire of constantius expressly recognized the right of nuns to be buried in religion that is to say beneath the altar
3528-168669-0077	The world is nothing in the presence of the cross.
3528-168669-0078	Martin, the eleventh general of the Carthusians, gave to his order this device. Stat cru dum vulvator orbis.
3528-168669-0079	the prioress who is usually subjected to the barrier of silence and whose reservoir was overfull rose and exclaimed with the loquacity of a dam which has broken away
3528-168669-0080	I have on my right Benoit, and on my left Bernard. Who was Bernard?
3528-168669-0081	The First Abbot of Clairvaux
3528-168669-0082	his order has produced forty popes two hundred cardinals fifty patriarchs sixteen hundred archbishops four thousand six hundred bishops four emperors twelve empresses forty-six kings forty-one queens three thousand six hundred canonized saints and has been in existence for fourteen hundred years
3528-168669-0083	on one side st bernard on the other the agent of the sanitary department
3528-168669-0084	God subordinated to the commissary of police. Such is the age. Silence, Favant!
3528-168669-0085	No one doubts the right of the monastery to sepulture.
3528-168669-0086	Only fanatics and those in error deny it.
3528-168669-0087	We live in times of terrible confusion.
3528-168669-0088	We are ignorant and impious.
3528-168669-0089	And then religion is attacked. Why?
3528-168669-0090	because there have been bad priests because sagater bishop of gap was a brother of salone bishop of embram and because both of them followed mamal
3528-168669-0091	They persecute the saints.
3528-168669-0092	They shut their eyes to the truth. Darkness is the rule.
3528-168669-0093	The most ferocious beasts are beasts which are blind.
3528-168669-0094	Oh, how wicked people are.
3528-168669-0095	By order of the king signifies today. By order of the revolution.
3528-168669-0096	One no longer knows what is due to the living or to the dead. A holy death is prohibited.
3528-168669-0097	gauthier bishop of chalons held his own in this matter against otho duke of burgundy
3528-168669-0098	The prioress took breath, then turned to Farcevant.
3528-168669-0099	You will close the coffin. The sisters will carry it to the chapel.
3528-168669-0100	The office for the dead will then be set.
3528-168669-0101	But she will hear. She will not listen.
3528-168669-0102	Besides, what the cloister knows the world learns not.
3528-168669-0103	A pause ensued.
3528-168669-0104	You will remove your belt.
3528-168669-0105	"'Has the doctor for the dead paid his visit?'
3528-168669-0106	"'He will pay it at four o'clock to-day.'
3528-168669-0107	The appeal which orders the doctor for the dead to be summoned has already been wrung.
3528-168669-0108	"'But you do not understand any of the peels.'
3528-168669-0109	That is well, Father Fafn.
3528-168669-0110	Where will you obtain it?
3528-168669-0111	I have my heap of old iron at the bottom of the garden.
3528-168669-0112	"'Reverend Mother?' "'What?'
3528-168669-0113	"'If you were ever to have any other jobs of this sort, my brother is the strong man for you—a perfect Turk.'
3528-168669-0114	"'You will do it as speedily as possible.'
3528-168669-0115	"'I cannot work very fast. I am infirm. That is why I require an assistant. I limp.'
3528-168669-0116	Everything must have been completed a good quarter of an hour before that.
3528-168669-0117	I will do anything to prove my zeal towards the community. These are my orders. I am to nail up the coffin.
3528-168669-0118	At eleven o'clock exactly I am to be in the chapel.
3528-168669-0119	"'Mother Ascension will be there. Two men would be better.'
3528-168669-0120	"'However, never mind. I shall have my lever.'
3528-168669-0121	after which there will be no trace of anything.
3528-168669-0122	The government will have no suspicion.
3528-168669-0123	The empty coffin remains. This produced a pause.
3528-168669-0124	"'What is to be done with that coffin, Father Prevent?'
3528-168669-0125	It will be given to the earth. Empty.
3528-168669-0126	"'Ah, the death!' exclaimed Frosch-Lavant.
3528-168669-0127	The veal stuck fast in his throat.
3528-168669-0128	He made haste to improvise an expedient to make her forget the oath.
3528-168669-0129	"'I will put earth in the coffin, Reverend Mother. That will produce the effect of a corpse.'
3528-168669-0130	I will make that my special business.
3538-142836-0000	General observations on preserves, confectionery, ices, and dessert dishes.
3538-142836-0001	the expense of preserving them with sugar is a serious objection for except the sugar is used in considerable qualities the success is very uncertain
3538-142836-0002	Fruit gathered in wet or foggy weather will soon be mildewed, and be of no service for preserves.
3538-142836-0003	but to distinguish these properly requires very great attention and considerable experience
3538-142836-0004	if you dip the finger into the syrup and apply it to the thumb the tenacity of the syrup will on separating the finger and thumb afford a thread which shortly breaks this is the little thread
3538-142836-0005	Let it boil up again, then take it off, and remove carefully the scum that has risen.
3538-142836-0006	It is considered to be sufficiently boiled when some taken up in a spoon pours out like oil.
3538-142836-0007	before sugar was in use honey was employed to preserve many vegetable productions though this substance has now given way to the juice of the sugar-cane
3538-142836-0008	1499
3538-142836-0009	boil them up three days successively skimming each time and they will then be finished and in a state fit to be put into pots for use
3538-142836-0010	the reason why the fruit is emptied out of the preserving pan into an earthen pan is that the acid of the fruit acts upon the copper of which the preserving pans are usually made
3538-142836-0011	From this example, the process of preserving fruits by syrup would be easily comprehended.
3538-142836-0012	they should be dried in the stove or oven on a sieve and turned every six or eight hours fresh powdered sugar being sifted over them every time they are turned
3538-142836-0013	In this way it is also that orange and lemon chips are preserved.
3538-142836-0014	marmalades jams and fruit-paste are of the same nature and are now in very general request
3538-142836-0015	marmalades and jams differ little from each other they are preserves of half liquid consistency made by boiling the pulp of fruits and sometimes part of the rinds with sugar
3538-142836-0016	that they may keep it as necessary not to be sparing of sugar. 1503
3538-142836-0017	in all the operations for preserve making when the preserving pan is used it should not be placed on the fire but on a trivet unless the jam is made on a hot plate when this is not necessary
3538-142836-0018	Confectionary, 1508.
3538-142836-0019	in speaking of confectionery it should be remarked that all the various preparations above named come strictly speaking under that head from the various fruits flours herbs roots and juices which when boiled with sugar were formerly employed in pharmacy as well as for sweetmeats were called confections from the latin word confiercer to make up but the term confectionery embraces a very large class indeed of sweet food many kinds of which should not be attempted in the ordinary
3538-142836-0020	the thousand and one ornamental dishes that adorn the tables of the wealthy should be purchased from the confectioner and they cannot profitably be made at home
3538-142836-0021	However, as late as the reign of our two last Georges, fabulous sums were often expended upon fanciful desserts.
3538-142836-0022	the shape of the dishes varies at different periods the prevailing fashion at present being oval and circular dishes on stems
3538-142836-0023	ICES.
3538-142836-0024	At desserts or at some evening parties, ices are scarcely to be dispensed with.
3538-142836-0025	The spattle is generally made of copper, kept bright and clean.
3538-142836-0026	they should be taken immediately after the repast or some hours after because the taking of these substances during the process of digestion is apt to provoke indisposition
3538-163619-0000	There was once at a time a widower who had a son and a daughter by his first wife.
3538-163619-0001	from the very day that the new wife came into the house there was no peace for the man's children and not a corner to be found where they could get any rest so the boy thought that the best thing he could do was to go out into the world and try to earn his own bread
3538-163619-0002	But his sister, who was still at home, fared worse and worse.
3538-163619-0003	"'Kiss me, girl,' said the head.
3538-163619-0004	and when the king entered and saw it he stood still as if he were in fetters and could not stir from the spot for the picture seemed to him so beautiful
3538-163619-0005	The youth promised to make all the haste he could, and set forth from the king's palace.
3538-163619-0006	At last they came in sight of land.
3538-163619-0007	well if my brother says so i must do it said the man's daughter and she flung her casket into the sea
3538-163619-0008	"'What is my brother saying?' asked his sister again."
3538-163619-0009	on the first thursday night after this a beautiful maiden came into the kitchen of the palace and begged the kitchen-maid who slept there to lend her a brush
3538-163619-0010	She begged very prettily, and got it, and then she brushed her hair, and the gold dropped from it.
3538-163619-0011	out on thee ugly bushy bride sleeping so soft by the young king's side on sand and stones my bed i make and my brother sleeps with the cold snake unpitied and unwept
3538-163619-0012	"'I shall come twice more, and then never again,' said she."
3538-163619-0013	this time also as before she borrowed a brush and brushed her hair with it and the gold dropped down as she did it and again she sent the dog out three times and when day dawned she departed but as she was going she said as she had said before i shall come once more and then never again
3538-163619-0014	"'No one can tell how delighted the king was "'to get rid of that hideous bushy bride "'and get a queen who was bright and beautiful as day itself.'
3538-163622-0000	Wilt thou serve me, and watch my seven foals, asked the king?
3538-163622-0001	The youth thought that it was very easy work to watch the foals, and that he could do it well enough.
3538-163622-0002	hast thou watched faithfully and well the whole day long said the king when the lad came into his presence in the evening
3538-163622-0003	"'Yes, that I have,' said the youth.
3538-163622-0004	"'He had gone out once to seek a place,' he said, "'but never would he do such a thing again.'
3538-163622-0005	Then the king promised him the same punishment and the same reward that he had promised his brother.
3538-163622-0006	when he had run after the foals for a long long time and was hot and tired he passed by a cleft in the rock where an old woman was sitting spinning with the distaff and she called to him
3538-163622-0007	"'Come hither, come hither, my handsome son, and let me comb your hair.'
3538-163622-0008	The youth liked the thought of this, let the foals run where they chose, and seated himself in the cleft of the rock by the side of the old hag.
3538-163622-0009	So there he sat with his head on her lap, taking his ease the livelong day.
3538-163622-0010	On the third day, Siddalad wanted to set out.
3538-163622-0011	the two brothers laughed at him and his father and mother begged him not to go but all to no purpose and cinder lad set out on his way
3538-163622-0012	"'I am walking about in search of a place,' said Cinder Ladd.
3538-163622-0013	"'I would much rather have the princess,' said Cinder Ladd.
3538-163622-0014	and thus they journeyed onwards a long, long way.
3538-163622-0015	When they had gone thus for a long, long way, the foal again asked, Dost thou see anything now?
3538-163622-0016	"'Yes. Now I see something that is white,' said Cinderlad.
3538-163622-0017	It looks like the trunk of a great thick birch tree.
3538-163622-0018	scindolad tried but could not do it so he had to take a draught from the pitcher and then one more and after that still another and then he was able to wield the sword with perfect ease
3538-163622-0019	for we are brothers of the princess whom thou art to have when thou canst tell the king what we eat and drink but there is a mighty troll who has cast a spell over us
3538-163622-0020	When they had travelled a long, long way, the foal said, Dost thou see anything?
3538-163622-0021	and now inquire the full, say star nothing now?
3538-163622-0022	"'Now then,' said the fool, "'dost thou not see anything now?'
3538-163622-0023	"'That is a river,' said the foal, "'and we have to cross it.'
3538-163622-0024	"'I have done my best,' replied Cinder Ladd.
3538-163624-0000	Once upon a time there was a king in the north who had won many wars, but now he was old.
3538-163624-0001	The old king went out and fought bravely, but at last his sword broke, and he was wounded, and his men fled.
3538-163624-0002	but in the night when the battle was over his young wife came out and searched for him among the slain and at last she found him and asked whether he might be healed
3538-163624-0003	So he asked the queen, How do you know in the dark of night whether the hours are wearing to the morning? And she said,
3538-163624-0004	Then the old man said, drive all the horses into the river, and choose the one that swims across.
3538-163624-0005	"'He is no bigger than other dragons,' said the tutor, "'and if you were as brave as your father, you would not fear him.'
3538-163624-0006	then the person who had killed otter went down and caught the dwarf who owned all the treasure and took it from him
3538-163624-0007	Only one ring was left, which the dwarf wore, and even that was taken from him.
3538-163624-0008	So Regan made a sword, and Sigurd tried it with a blow on a lump of iron, and the sword broke.
3538-163624-0009	Then Sigurd went to his mother and asked for the broken pieces of his father's blade and gave them to Regan.
3538-163624-0010	So Sigurd said that sword would do.
3538-163624-0011	Then he saw the track which the dragon had made when he went to a cliff to drink, and the track was as if a great river had rolled along and left a deep valley.
3538-163624-0012	But Sigurd waited till half of him had crawled over the pit, and then he thrust the sword Graham right into his very heart.
3538-163624-0013	Sigurd said, I would touch none of it if by losing it I should never die.
3538-163624-0014	But all men die, and no brave man lets death frighten him from his desire.
3538-163624-0015	"'Die, thou Fafner!' And then Fafner died.
3538-163624-0016	Then Sigurd rode back and met Regan, and Regan asked him to roast Fafner's heart and let him taste of it.
3538-163624-0017	So Sigurd put the heart of Fafnir on a stake and roasted it.
3538-163624-0018	There is Sigurd roasting Fafner's heart for another, when he should taste of it himself and learn all wisdom.'
3538-163624-0019	That let him do, then ride over Hinfeld to the place where Brunhild sleeps.
3538-163624-0020	there must she sleep till thou com'st for her waking rise up and ride for now sure she will swear the vow fearless of breaking
3538-163624-0021	Then he took the helmet off the head of the sleeper, and behold, she was a most beautiful lady.
3538-163624-0022	Then Sigurd rode away, and he came to the house of a king who had a fair daughter.
3538-163624-0023	lindbrunhild's father told gunnar that she would marry none but him who could ride the flame in front of her enchanted tower and thither they rode and gunnar set his horse at the flame but he would not face it
3538-163624-0024	For one day, when Brunhild and Gundren were bathing, Brunhild waded farthest out into the river, and said she did that to show she was Gundren's superior.
3538-163624-0025	for her husband she said had ridden through the flame when no other man dared face it
3538-163624-0026	"'Not long to wait,' he said, "'till the bitter sword stands fast in my heart, "'and thou will not live long when I am dead.'
367-130732-0000	Lobsters and lobsters.
367-130732-0001	When is a lobster not a lobster? When it is a crayfish.
367-130732-0002	This question and answer might well go into the primary of information for those who come to San Francisco from the East, for what is called a lobster in San Francisco is not a lobster at all, but a crayfish.
367-130732-0003	the pacific crayfish however serves every purpose and while many contend that its meat is not so delicate in flavor as that of its eastern cousin the californian will as strenuously insist that it is better but of course something must always be allowed for the patriotism of the californian
367-130732-0004	A book could be written about this restaurant, and then all would not be told, for all its secrets can never be known.
367-130732-0005	it was here that most magnificent dinners were arranged it was here that extraordinary dishes were concocted by chefs with worldwide fame it was here that lobster a la newberg reached its highest perfection and this is the recipe that was followed when it was prepared in the domo
367-130732-0006	Lobster Ellen Newberg.
367-130732-0007	1 pound of lobster meat, 1 teaspoon full of butter, 1 half pint of cream, yolks of 4 eggs, 1 wine glass of sherry, lobster fat.
367-130732-0008	Put this in a double boiler and let cook until thick, stirring constantly.
367-130732-0009	Serve in a chafing dish with thin slices of dry toast.
367-130732-0010	King of Shellfish
367-130732-0011	One has to come to San Francisco to partake of the king of shellfish, the mammoth pacific crab.
367-130732-0012	i say come to san francisco advisedly for while the crab is found all along the coast it is prepared no where so deliciously as in san francisco
367-130732-0013	goby's passed with the fire and the little restaurant bearing his name and in charge of his widow in union square avenue has not attained the fame of the old place
367-130732-0014	it is possible that she knows the secret of preparing crab as it was prepared in the gobies of before the fire but his prestige did not descend to her
367-130732-0015	Gobi's Crab Stew
367-130732-0016	Take the meat of one large crab, scraping out all the fat from the shell.
367-130732-0017	Soak the crab meat in the sherry two hours before cooking.
367-130732-0018	Chop fine the onion, sweet pepper, and tomato with the rosemary.
367-130732-0019	Heat this in a stewpan and when simmering add the sherry and crab meat and let all cook together with a slow fire for 8 minutes.
367-130732-0020	Serve in a chafing dish with toasted crackers or thin slices of toasted bread.
367-130732-0021	Lobster in miniature.
367-130732-0022	so far it has been used mostly for garnishment of other dishes and it is only recently that the hofbrau has been making a specialty of them
367-130732-0023	All of the better class restaurants, however, will serve them if you order them.
367-130732-0024	This is the recipe for eight people and it is well worth trying if you are giving a dinner of importance.
367-130732-0025	Bisc of crawfish.
367-130732-0026	take thirty crawfish from which remove the gut containing the gall in the following manner take firm hold of the crawfish with the left hand so as to avoid being pinched by its claws with the thumb and forefinger of the right hand pinch the extreme end of the central fin of the tail and with a sudden jerk the gut will be withdrawn
367-130732-0027	mince or cut into small dice a carrot an onion one head of celery and a few parsley roots and to these add a bay leaf a sprig of thyme a little mino net pepper and two ounces of butter
367-130732-0028	Put these ingredients into a stewpan and fry them 10 minutes. Then throw in the crawfish and pour on them half a bottle of French white wine.
367-130732-0029	Allow this to boil and then add a quart of strong consomme and let all continue boiling for half an hour.
367-130732-0030	Pick out the crawfish and strain the broth through a napkin by pressure into a basin in order to extract all the essence from the vegetables.
367-130732-0031	Pick the shells off 25 of the crawfish tails, trim them neatly and set them aside until wanted.
367-130732-0032	Reserve some of the spawn, also half of the body shells with which to make the crawfish butter to finish the soup.
367-130732-0033	This butter is made as follows. Place the shells on a baking sheet in the oven to dry. Let the shells cool and then pound them in a mortar with a little lobster coral and 4 ounces of fresh butter, thoroughly bruising the whole together so as to make a fine paste.
367-293981-0000	"'I swear it,' answered Sancho.
367-293981-0001	"'I say so,' continued Don Quixote, "'because I hate taking away anyone's good name.'
367-293981-0002	"'I say,' replied Sancho, "'that I swear to hold my tongue about it till the end of your worship stays, "'and, congrat, I may be able to let it out to-morrow.'
367-293981-0003	though your worship was not so badly off having in your arms the incomparable beauty you spoke of but i what did i have except the heaviest wax that i think i had in all my life
367-293981-0004	Unlucky me and the mother that bore me,
367-293981-0005	"'Didn't I say so? Worst luck to my lines,' said Sancho.
367-293981-0006	"'It cannot be the more,' answered Don Quixote, "'for those under enchantment do not let themselves be seen by anyone.'
367-293981-0007	"'If they do not let themselves be seen, they let themselves be felt,' said Sancho. "'If not, let my shoulders speak to the point.'
367-293981-0008	mine could speak too said don quixote but that is not a suspicion of reason for believing that what we see is the enchanted moor
367-293981-0009	The officers turned to him and said, Well, how goes it, good man?
367-293981-0010	sancho got up with pain enough in his bones and went after the innkeeper in the dark and meeting the officer who was looking to see what had become of his enemy he said to him senor whoever you are do us the favor and kindness to give us a little rosemary oil salt and wine for it is wanted to cure one of our best knights-errant on earth who lies on yonder bed wounded by the hands of the enchanted moor that is in this inn
367-293981-0011	to be brief he took the materials of which he made a compound mixing them all and boiling them a good while until it seemed to him they had come to perfection
367-293981-0012	sancho panza who also regarded the amendment of his master as miraculous begged him to give him what was left in the pigskin which was no small quantity
367-293981-0013	don quixote consented and he taking it with both hands in good faith and with a better will gulped it down and drained off very little less than his master
367-293981-0014	If your worship knew that, returned Satcho, woe betide me and all my kindred. Why did you let me taste it?
367-293981-0015	search your memory and if you find anything of this kind you need only tell me of it and i promise you by the order of knighthood which i have received to procure you satisfaction and reparation to the utmost of your desire
367-293981-0016	Then this isn't in, said Don Quixote.
367-293981-0017	And a very respectable one, said the innkeeper.
367-293981-0018	the cries of the poor blanketed wretch were so loud that they reached the ears of his master who halting to listen attentively was persuaded that some new adventure was coming until he clearly perceived that it was his squire who uttered them
367-293981-0019	he saw him rising and falling in the air with such grace and nimbleness that had his rage allowed him it is my belief he would have laughed
367-293981-0020	sancho took it and as he was raising it to his mouth he was stopped by the cries of his master exclaiming sancho my son drink not water drink it not my son for it will kill thee see here i have the blessed balsam and he held up the flask of liquor and with drinking two drops of it thou wilt certainly be restored
3764-168670-0000	The strides of a lame man are like the ogling glances of a one-eyed man. They do not reach their goal very promptly.
3764-168670-0001	Cosette had waked up.
3764-168670-0002	Jean Valjean had placed her near the fire.
3764-168670-0003	You will wait for me at a lady's house. I shall come to fetch you.
3764-168670-0004	Everything is arranged and nothing is, said Fauchelevent.
3764-168670-0005	I have permission to bring you in, but before bringing you in, you must be got out.
3764-168670-0006	That's where the difficulty lies.
3764-168670-0007	It is easy enough with the child. You will carry her out.
3764-168670-0008	And she will hold her tongue? I answer for that.
3764-168670-0009	Fauchelevent grumbled more to himself than to Jean Valjean.
3764-168670-0010	You understand, Father Madeleine, the government will notice it.
3764-168670-0011	Jean Valjean stared him straight in the eye and thought that he was raving.
3764-168670-0012	Fush, LeVon went on.
3764-168670-0013	It is tomorrow that I am to bring you in. The Prioress expects you.
3764-168670-0014	Then he explained to Jean Valjean that this was his recompense for a service which he, Fauche-Levent, was to render to the community.
3764-168670-0015	that the nun who had died that morning had requested to be buried in the coffin which had served her for a bed and interred in the vault under the altar of the chapel
3764-168670-0016	that the prioress and the vocal mothers intended to fulfil the wish of the deceased.
3764-168670-0017	that he, Fauche-Levent, was to nail up the coffin in the cell, raise the stone in the chapel, and blower the corpse into the vault.
3764-168670-0018	And then that there was another, the empty coffin.
3764-168670-0019	What is that empty coffin?
3764-168670-0020	asked Jean Valjean. Fauchelevent replied,
3764-168670-0021	What coffin? What administration?
3764-168670-0022	Fauchelevent, who was seated, sprang up as though a bomb had burst under his chair.
3764-168670-0023	You know, François Levent, what you have said. Mother Crucifixion is dead.
3764-168670-0024	And I add, and Father Madeline is buried.
3764-168670-0025	You are not like other men, Father Madeleine.
3764-168670-0026	This offers the means. Give me some information in the first place.
3764-168670-0027	How long is the coffin? Six feet.
3764-168670-0028	It is a chamber on the ground floor which has a grated window opening on the garden which is closed on the outside by a shutter and two doors. One leads into the convent, the other into the church. What church?
3764-168670-0029	the church in the street, the church which anyone can enter.
3764-168670-0030	Have you the keys to those two doors?
3764-168670-0031	No, I have the key to the door which communicates with the convent. The porter has the key to the door which communicates with the church.
3764-168670-0032	only to allow the undertaker's men to enter when they come to get the coffin.
3764-168670-0033	Who nails up the coffin? But I do.
3764-168670-0034	Who spreads the pool over it?
3764-168670-0035	Not another man, except the police doctor, can enter the dead room. That is even written on the wall.
3764-168670-0036	"'Could you hide me in that room to-night, when everyone is asleep?'
3764-168670-0037	About three o'clock in the afternoon
3764-168670-0038	I shall be hungry, but I will bring you something.
3764-168670-0039	You can come and nail me up in the coffin at two o'clock.
3764-168670-0040	Fauchelevent recoiled and cracked his finger joints. But that is impossible.
3764-168670-0041	Bah! Impossible to take a hammer and drive some nails in a plank.
3764-168670-0042	Jean Valjean had been in worse straits than this.
3764-168670-0043	Any man who has been a prisoner understands how to contract himself to fit the diameter of the escape.
3764-168670-0044	What does not a man undergo for the sake of a cure?
3764-168670-0045	to have himself nailed up in a case and carried off like a bale of goods to live for a long time in a box to find air where there is none to economise his breath for hours to know how to stifle without dying this was one of jean valjean's gloomy talents
3764-168670-0046	you surely must have a gimlet you will make a few holes here and there around my mouth and you will nail the top plancon loosely good and what if you should happen to cough or to sneeze
3764-168670-0047	A man who is making his escape does not cough or sneeze.
3764-168670-0048	Who is there who has not said to a cat, Do come in?
3764-168670-0049	The over-prudent, cats as they are, and because they are cats, sometimes incur more danger than the audacious.
3764-168670-0050	But Jean Valjean's coolness prevailed over him, in spite of himself. He grumbled, "'I'm sorry.'
3764-168670-0051	If you are sure of coming out of the coffin alright, I am sure of getting you out of the grave.
3764-168670-0052	An old fellow of the old school. The gravedigger puts the corpses in the grave, and I put the gravedigger in my pocket.
3764-168670-0053	I shall follow. That is my business.
3764-168670-0054	The hearse halts, the undertaker's men knot a rope around your coffin and lower you down.
3764-168670-0055	The priest says the prayers, makes the sign of the cross, sprinkles the holy water and takes his departure.
3764-168670-0056	one of two things will happen. He will either be sober or he will not be sober.
3764-168670-0057	That is settled, Father Fauchelevent. All will go well.
3764-168671-0000	on the following day as the sun was declining the very rare passers-by on the boulevard du maine pulled off their hats to an old-fashioned hearse ornamented with skulls cross-bones and tears
3764-168671-0001	this hearse contained a coffin covered with a white cloth over which spread a large black cross like a huge corpse with drooping arms
3764-168671-0002	a mourning coach in which could be seen a priest in his surplice and a choir boy in his red cap followed
3764-168671-0003	behind it came an old man in the garments of a labourer who limped along
3764-168671-0004	the grave-diggers being thus bound to service in the evening in summer and at night in winter in this cemetery they were subjected to a special discipline
3764-168671-0005	these gates therefore swung inexorably on their hinges at the instant when the sun disappeared behind the dome of the invalides
3764-168671-0006	Dampness was invading it. The flowers were deserting it.
3764-168671-0007	the bourgeois did not care much about being buried in the vaugerard it hinted at poverty par la chaise if you please
3764-168671-0008	to be buried in perlaches is equivalent to having furniture of mahogany it is recognized as elegant
3764-168671-0009	the interment of mother crucifixion in the vault under the altar the exit of cosette the introduction of jean valjean into the dead-room all had been executed without difficulty and there had been no hitch let us remark in passing that the burial of mother crucifixion under the altar of the convent is a perfectly venial offence in our sight
3764-168671-0010	It is one of the faults which resemble a duty.
3764-168671-0011	The nuns had committed it, not only without difficulty, but even with the applause of their own consciences.
3764-168671-0012	In the cloister, what is called the government is only an intermeddling with authority, an interference which is always questionable.
3764-168671-0013	Make as many laws as you please, men, but keep them for yourselves.
3764-168671-0014	A prince is nothing in the presence of a principal.
3764-168671-0015	Fauchelevent limped along behind the hearse in a very contented frame of mind.
3764-168671-0016	Jean Valjean's composure was one of those powerful tranquillities which are contagious.
3764-168671-0017	What remained to be done was a mere nothing.
3764-168671-0018	He played with Father Mestian.
3764-168671-0019	He did what he liked with him. He made him dance according to his whim.
3764-168671-0020	The permission for interment must be exhibited.
3764-168671-0021	He was a sort of labouring man, who wore a waistcoat with large pockets and carried a mattock under his arm.
3764-168671-0022	"'The man replied, "'The gravedigger.'
3764-168671-0023	"'The gravedigger?' "'Yes.'
3764-168671-0024	You. I.
3764-168671-0025	Father Mastien is the gravedigger. He was.
3764-168671-0026	"'Fauchelevent had expected anything but this, "'that a grave-digger could die.'
3764-168671-0027	It is true, nevertheless, that gravediggers do die themselves.
3764-168671-0028	He had hardly the strength to stammer,
3764-168671-0029	But," he persisted feebly, "'Father Mestienne is the grave-digger.'
3764-168671-0030	Do you know who little Father Lenoir is? Here's a jug of red wine.
3764-168671-0031	But you're a jolly fellow too.
3764-168671-0032	Are you not, comrade? We'll go and have a drink together presently.
3764-168671-0033	The man replied,
3764-168671-0034	"'He limped more out of anxiety than from infirmity.'
3764-168671-0035	The gravedigger walked on in front of him.
3764-168671-0036	Fauchelevent passed the unexpected Crébier once more in review.
3764-168671-0037	fauchelevent who was illiterate but very sharp understood that he had to deal with a formidable species of man with a fine talker he muttered
3764-168671-0038	So, Father Mestien is dead.
3764-168671-0039	The man replied, "'Completely.'
3764-168671-0040	the good god consulted his note-book which shows when the time is up it was father mestienne's turn father mestienne died
3764-168671-0041	stammered Fauchelevent. It is made.
3764-168671-0042	You are a peasant. I am a Parisian.
3764-168671-0043	Ferdinand von thought, ''I am lost.''
3764-168671-0044	There were only a few turns of the wheel distant from the small alley leading to the nun's corner.
3764-168671-0045	"'And he added, with the satisfaction of a serious man "'who is turning a phrase well,
3764-168671-0046	fortunately the soil which was light and wet with the winter rains clogged the wheels and retarded its speed
3764-168671-0047	My father was a porter at the Pretaneum Town Hall.
3764-168671-0048	but he had reverses he had losses on change i was obliged to renounce the profession of author but i am still a public writer
3764-168671-0049	So you are not a gravedigger, then?
3764-168671-0050	returned fauchelevent clutching at this branch feeble as it was
3764-168671-0051	Here a remark becomes necessary.
3764-168671-0052	A fauchelevent, whatever his anguish, offered a drink, but he did not explain himself on one point who was to pay.
3764-168671-0053	The gravedigger went on with a superior smile.
3764-168671-0054	One must eat.
3997-180294-0000	the duke comes every morning they will tell him when he comes that i am asleep and perhaps he will wait until i awake
3997-180294-0001	"'Yes. But if I should already ask for something—' "'What?'
3997-180294-0002	well do it for me for i swear to you that i don't love you as the others have loved you
3997-180294-0003	There are bolts in the door. Wretch!
3997-180294-0004	I don't know how it is, but it seems to me as if I do.
3997-180294-0005	Now go. I can't keep my eyes open.
3997-180294-0006	it seemed to me as if this sleeping city belonged to me i searched my memory for the names of those whose happiness i had once envied and i could not recall one without finding myself the happier
3997-180294-0007	education family feeling a sense of duty the family are strong sentinels but there are no sentinels so vigilant as not to be deceived by a girl of sixteen to whom nature by the voice of the man she loves gives the first counsel of love all the more ardent because they seem so pure
3997-180294-0008	the more a girl believes in goodness the more easily will she give way if not to her lover at least to love for being without mistrust she is without force and to win her love is a triumph that can be gained by any young man of five and twenty see how young girls are watched and guarded
3997-180294-0009	then how surely must they desire the world which is hidden from them how surely must they find it tempting how surely must they listen to the first voice which comes to tell its secret through their bars and bless the hand which is the first to raise a corner of the mystery veil
3997-180294-0010	with them the body has worn out the soul the senses have burned up the heart dissipation has blunted the feelings
3997-180294-0011	They love by profession and not by instinct.
3997-180294-0012	when a creature who has all her past to reproach herself with is taken all at once by a profound sincere irresistible love of which she had never felt herself capable when she has confessed her love how absolutely the man whom she loves dominates her
3997-180294-0013	They know not what proof to give.
3997-180294-0014	in order to disturb the labourers in the field was one day devoured by a wolf because those whom he had so often deceived no longer believed in his cries for help
3997-180294-0015	This is the same with these unhappy women when they love seriously.
3997-180294-0016	but when the man who inspires this redeeming love is great enough in soul to receive it without remembering the past when he gives himself up to it when in short he loves as he is loved this man drains at one draught all earthly emotions and after such a love his heart will be closed to every other
3997-180294-0017	but to return to the first day of my liaison
3997-180294-0018	When I reached home, I was in a state of mad gaiety.
3997-180294-0019	The woman becomes the man's mistress and loves him.
3997-180294-0020	How? Why?
3997-180294-0021	my whole being was exalted into joy at the memory of the words we had exchanged during that first night
3997-180294-0022	Here are my orders. Tonight at vaudeville.
3997-180294-0023	Come during the third entrant.
3997-180294-0024	The boxes filled one after another.
3997-180294-0025	Only one remains empty, the stage box.
3997-180294-0026	at the beginning of the third act i heard the door of the box on which my eyes had been almost constantly fixed open and marguerite appeared
3997-180294-0027	Did she love me enough to believe that the more beautiful she looked, the happier I should be?
3997-180294-0028	what is the matter with you to-night said marguerite rising and coming to the back of the box and kissing me on the forehead
3997-180294-0029	you should go to bed she replied with that ironic air which went so well with her delicate and witty face
3997-180294-0030	Where? At home?
3997-180294-0031	"'You still love me? Can you ask?'
3997-180294-0032	Because you don't like seeing him.
3997-180294-0033	none the less i was very unhappy all the rest of the evening and went away very sadly after having seen prudence the count and marguerite get into the carriage which was waiting for them at the door
3997-180297-0000	I have not come to hinder you from leaving Paris.
3997-180297-0001	you in the way marguerite but how
3997-180297-0002	well you might have had a woman here said prudence and it would hardly have been amusing for her to see two more arrive
3997-180297-0003	During this remark, Marguerite looked at me attentively.
3997-180297-0004	"'My dear Prudence,' I answered, "'you do not know what you are saying.'
3997-180297-0005	yes but besides not wishing to put you out i was sure that if you came as far as my door you would want to come up and as i could not let you i did not wish to let you go away blaming me for saying no
3997-180297-0006	because i am watched and the least suspicion might do me the greatest harm
3997-180297-0007	Is that really the only reason?
3997-180297-0008	If there were any other, I would tell you, for we are not to have any secrets from one another now.
3997-180297-0009	Honestly, do you care for me a little?"
3997-180297-0010	i fancied for a moment that i might give myself that happiness for six months you would not have it you insisted on knowing the means
3997-180297-0011	Well, good heavens, the means were easy enough to guess.
3997-180297-0012	I listened, and I gazed at Marguerite with admiration.
3997-180297-0013	when i thought that this marvellous creature whose feet i had once longed to kiss was willing to let me take my place in her thoughts my part in her life and that i was not yet content with what she gave me i asked if man's desire had indeed limits when satisfied as promptly as mine had been it reached after something further
3997-180297-0014	truly she continued we poor creatures of chance have fantastic desire and inconceivable loves
3997-180297-0015	We are not allowed to have hearts under penalty of being hooted down and of ruining our credit.
3997-180297-0016	We no longer belong to ourselves,
3997-180297-0017	We stand first in their self-esteem, last in their esteem.
3997-180297-0018	Never do they give you advice which is not lucrative.
3997-180297-0019	it means little enough to them that we should have ten lovers extra as long as they get dresses or a bracelet out of them and that they can drive in our carriage from time to time or come to our box at the theatre
3997-180297-0020	such a man i found in the duke but the duke is old and old age neither protects nor consoles
3997-180297-0021	I thought I could accept the life which he offered me, but what would you have?
3997-180297-0022	what i loved in you was not the man who was but the man who was going to be
3997-180297-0023	marguerite tired out with this long confession threw herself back on the sofa and to stifle a slight cough put up her handkerchief to her lips and from that to her eyes
3997-180297-0024	marguerite do with me as you will i am your slave your dog but in the name of heaven tear up the letter which i wrote to you and do not make me leave you to-morrow it would kill me
3997-180297-0025	marguerite drew the letter from her bosom and handing it to me with a smile of infinite sweetness said
3997-180297-0026	Here it is. I have brought it back.
3997-180297-0027	I tore the letter into fragments and kissed with tears the hand that gave it to me.
3997-180297-0028	"'Look here, Prudence. Do you know what he wants?' said Marguerite.
3997-180297-0029	He wants you to forgive him.
3997-180297-0030	"'One has to. But he wants more than that.' "'What then?'
3997-180297-0031	"'I embraced Marguerite until she was almost stifled.'
3997-182399-0000	"'All Mr. Buzzard grinned.'
3997-182399-0001	This sounded like another story.
3997-182399-0002	he was curious about that black-headed cousin of old mr buzzard very curious indeed
3997-182399-0003	Anyway, he would find out
3997-182399-0004	"'Please, Mr. Buzzard, please tell us the story,' he begged.
3997-182399-0005	now all mr buzzard is naturally good-natured and accommodating and when peter begged so hard he just couldn't find it in his heart to refuse
3997-182399-0006	way back in the days when grandpa buzzard had his little falling out with old king eagle and done fly so high he scorched the feathers off'n his head he had a cousin did grandpa buzzard and this cousin was just naturally lazy and no count
3997-182399-0007	like most no-count people he used to make a regular nuisance of himself poking his nose into everybody's business and never tending to his own
3997-182399-0008	wasn't anything going on that this trifling member of the buzzard family didn't find out about at meddle inn he could ask more questions than peter rabbit can and anybody that can do that has got to ask a lot
3997-182399-0009	Everybody looked at Peter and laughed.
3997-182399-0010	so we uns sit on the chimney-tops whenever old jack frost gets to straying down where he have no business
3997-182399-0011	One day, this no-count trifling cousin of Grandpa Buzzard get cold in his feet.
3997-182399-0012	"'It was on the little old house, "'a little old tumble-down house.'
3997-182399-0013	Why, he just stretched his full head as far down the chimney as he can and listened and listened.
3997-182399-0014	But he don't mind that.
3997-182399-0015	"'Will you all please speak a little louder?' he hollered down the chimney. "'Just like that.'
3997-182399-0016	yes sah she sho'ly was plump scared
3997-182399-0017	They'd like to choke that no-counters buzzard to death.
3997-182399-0018	when he get home he try and try to brush the suit off but it don't get into the skin and it stay there
3997-182399-0019	A little sigh of satisfaction went round the circle of listeners.
3997-182399-0020	It was just as good as one of Grandfather Frog's.
4198-12259-0000	draw reach fill mix give it me without water
4198-12259-0001	so my friend so whip me off this glass neatly bring me hither some claret a full weeping glass till it run over
4198-12259-0002	a cessation and truce with thirst.
4198-12259-0003	"'You have catched a cold, Gammer?' "'Yea, forsooth, sir.'
4198-12259-0004	by the belly of st buff let us talk of our drink i never drink but at my hours like the pope's mule
4198-12259-0005	Which was first, thirst or drinking?
4198-12259-0006	"'What? It seems I do not drink but by an attorney.'
4198-12259-0007	drink always and you shall never die
4198-12259-0008	if i drink not i am a ground dry gravelled and spent i am stark dead without drink and my soul ready to fly into some marsh amongst frogs the soul never dwells in a dry place drouth killeth it
4198-12259-0009	he drinks in vain that feels not the pleasure of it
4198-12259-0010	it is enough to break both girds and petrel
4198-12259-0011	What difference is there between a bottle and a flagging?
4198-12259-0012	bravely and well played upon the words
4198-12259-0013	Our fathers drank lustily and emptied their cans.
4198-12259-0014	Well cackled. Well sung.
4198-12259-0015	"'Come, let us drink. Will you send nothing to the river?'
4198-12259-0016	I drink no more than a sponge.
4198-12259-0017	I drink like a Templar knight.
4198-12259-0018	And I, Tenquam Sponsors.
4198-12259-0019	And I, Secret Terrorist in Aqua.
4198-12259-0020	Give me a synonym for a gammon of bacon.
4198-12259-0021	It is the compulsory of drinkers. It is a pulley.
4198-12259-0022	a little rain allays a great deal of wind long tippling breaks the thunder
4198-12259-0023	but if there came such liquor from my ballack will you not willingly thereafter suck the udder whence it issued
4198-12259-0024	Here, page fill.
4198-12259-0025	i appeal from thirst and disclaim its jurisdiction
4198-12259-0026	i was wont heretofore to drink out all but now i leave nothing
4198-12259-0027	hey they here are tripes fit for our sport and in earnest excellent go to billiose of the dun ox you know with the black streak
4198-12259-0028	oh for god's sake let us last them soundly yet thriftily
4198-12259-0029	sparrows will not eat unless you bob them on the tail nor can i drink if i be not fairly spoke to
4198-12259-0030	Oh, this was bangin' soundly.
4198-12259-0031	but they shall banish it utterly.
4198-12259-0032	let us wind our horns by the sound of flagons and bottles and cry aloud that whoever hath lost his thirst come not hither to seek it
4198-12259-0033	the great god made the planets and we make the platters
4198-12259-0034	appetite comes with eating says anguston but the thirst goes away with drinking
4198-12259-0035	i have a remedy against thirst quite contrary to that which is good against the biting of a man dog
4198-12259-0036	"'White wine here. Wine, boys.'
4198-12259-0037	O lacryma Christi! It is of the best grape.

4198-12259-0041	I should say, master passed.
4198-12259-0042	O the drinkers, those that are dry! O poor thirsty souls!
4198-12259-0043	Clear off. Neat. Supernaculum.
4198-12281-0000	although the plague was there in the most part of all the houses they nevertheless entered everywhere then plundered and carried away all that was within and yet for all this not one of them took any hurt which is a most wonderful case

4198-61336-0000	it is significant to note in this connection that the new king was an unswerving adherent of the cult of asshur by the adherents of which he was probably strongly supported
4198-61336-0001	At the beginning of his reign, there was much social discontent and suffering.
4198-61336-0002	well might shardouris exclaim in the words of the prophet where is the king of arpad
4198-61336-0003	tiglath paliser however crossed the euphrates and moving northward delivered an unexpected attack on the russian army in
4198-61336-0004	A fierce battle ensued, and one of its dramatic incidents was a single combat between the rival kings.
4198-61336-0005	an attempt was made to capture king chardurus who leapt from his chariot and made hasty escape on horseback hotly pursued in the gathering darkness by an assyrian contingent of cavalry
4198-61336-0006	Despite the blow dealt against Urartu, Assyria did not immediately regain possession of North Syria.
4198-61336-0007	the shifty Manti Ilyu either cherished the hope that Shadouris would recover strength and again invade north Syria, or that he might himself establish an empire in that region.
4198-61336-0008	Tiglath-Belizer had therefore to march westward again.
4198-61336-0009	For three years he conducted vigorous campaigns in the western land where he met with vigorous resistance.
4198-61336-0010	Arpad was captured and Manteillu deposed and probably put to death.
4198-61336-0011	Once again, the Hebrews came into contact with Assyria.
4198-61336-0012	Its fall may not have been unconnected with the trend of events in Assyria during the closing years of the Middle Empire.
4198-61336-0013	Jehoash, the grandson of Jehu, had achieved successes in conflict with Damascus.
4198-61336-0014	Six months afterward, he was assassinated by Shalom.
4198-61336-0015	This usurper held sway at Samaria for only a month.
4198-61336-0016	no resistance was possible on the part of menahem the usurper who was probably ready to welcome the assyrian conqueror so that by arranging an alliance he might secure his own position
4198-61336-0017	Tiglath-Pileser next operated against the Median and other hill tribes in the northeast.
4198-61336-0018	he overthrew buildings destroyed orchards and transported to nineveh those of the inhabitants he had not put to the sword with all the live stock he could lay hands on

4198-61336-0020	In the following year, Tiglath-Beliza returned to Syria.
4198-61336-0021	Menahem king of Israel had died and was succeeded by his son Pechahiah.
4198-61336-0022	Judah had taken advantage of the disturbed conditions in Israel to assert its independence.
4198-61336-0023	He condemned Israel for its idolatries and cried.

4198-61336-0027	He swept through Israel like a hurricane.
4198-61336-0028	The Philistines and the Arabians of the desert were also subdued.

4294-14317-0000	As I thought that this was due to some fault in the earth, I wanted to make these first experiments before I undertook my Perseus.
4294-14317-0001	when i saw that this bust came out sharp and clean i set at once to construct a little furnace in the workshop erected for me by the duke after my own plans and design in the house which the duke had given me
4294-14317-0002	it was an extremely difficult task and i was anxious to observe all the niceties of art which i had learned so as not to lapse into some error
4294-14317-0003	"'I, in my turn, feel the same desire, and hope to play my part like them. Therefore, my lord, give me the leave to go.'
4294-14317-0004	but beware of letting bandinello quit you rather bestow upon him always more than he demands for if he goes into foreign parts his ignorance is so presumptuous that he is just the man to disgrace our most illustrious school
4294-14317-0005	I ask no further reward for my labours up to this time than the gracious favour of your most illustrious excellency.
4294-14317-0006	then i thanked him and said i had no greater desire than to show those envious folk that i had it in me to execute the promised work
4294-14317-0007	I had better look to my conduct, for it had come to his ears that I relied upon his favour to take in first one man and then another.
4294-14317-0008	I begged his most illustrious excellency to name a single person whom I had ever taken in.
4294-14317-0009	i said my lord i thank you and beg you to condescend so far as to listen to four words it is true that he lent me a pair of old scales two anvils and three little hammers which articles i begged his workman giorgio da cortona fifteen days ago to fetch back
4294-14317-0010	"'Giorgio came for them his health.'
4294-14317-0011	"'I hope to prove on what account that scoundrel tries to bring me into disgrace.'
4294-14317-0012	when he had heard this speech the duke rose up in anger and sent for bernardone who was forced to take flight as far as venice he and antonio landi with him
4294-14317-0013	"'You had better put this to the proof, and I will go at once to the Bargello.'
4294-14317-0014	i am willing to enter into competition with the ancients and feel able to surpass them for since those early days in which i made the medals of pope clement i have learned so much that i can now produce far better pieces of the kind
4294-14317-0015	"'After several months were wasted, "'and Piero would neither work nor put men to work upon the piece, "'I made him give it back.'
4294-14317-0016	Among artists, certain enraged sculptors laughed at me and called me the new sculptor.

4294-14317-0018	Having this excellent resolve in heart, I reached my home.
4294-32859-0000	Wilder was rather surly after the ladies had floated away from the scene, and he drank his liquor doggedly.
4294-32859-0001	it was his fancy i suppose to revive certain sentimental relations which had it may be once existed between him and miss lake and he was a person of that combative temperament that magnifies an object in proportion as its pursuit is thwarted
4294-32859-0002	the story of Fridolin and wretches pretty outlines
4294-32859-0003	"'Sit down beside me, and I'll tell you the story.'
4294-32859-0004	he assisted at it but took no part and in fact was listening to that other conversation which sounded with its pleasant gabble and laughter like a little musical tinkle of bells in the distance
4294-32859-0005	But Honest Mark forgot that young ladies do not always come out quite alone and jump unassisted into their vehicles.
4294-35475-0000	But the middle son was little and lorn. He was neither dark nor fair. He was neither handsome nor strong.
4294-35475-0001	throwing himself on his knees before the king he cried o royal sire bestow upon me also a sword and a steed that i may up and away to follow my brethren
4294-35475-0002	But the king laughed him to scorn. Thou, a sword, he quoth.
4294-35475-0003	in sooth thou shalt have one but it shall be one befitting thy maiden size and courage if so small a weapon can be found in all my kingdom
4294-35475-0004	forthwith the grinning jester began shrieking with laughter so that the bells upon his motley cap were all set a-jangling
4294-35475-0005	i did but laugh to think the sword of ethelrede had been so quickly found responded the jester and he pointed to the scissors hanging from the tailor's girdle
4294-35475-0006	One night, as he lay in a deep forest, too unhappy to sleep, he heard a noise near at hand in the bushes.
4294-35475-0007	"'Thou shalt have thy liberty,' he cried, "'even though thou shouldst rend me in peace "'the moment thou art free.'
4294-35475-0008	it had suddenly disappeared and in its place stood a beautiful fairy with filmy wings which shone like rainbows in the moonlight
4294-35475-0009	At this moment there was a distant rumbling as of thunder. "'Tis the ogre!' cried the fairy. "'We must hasten!'
4294-35475-0010	Scissors, grow a giant's height and save us from Yogur's might.
4294-35475-0011	He could see the ogre standing powerless to hurt him on the other side of the chasm, and gnashing his teeth, each one of which was as big as a millstone.
4294-35475-0012	The sight was so terrible that he turned on his heel and fled away as fast as his feet could carry him.
4294-35475-0013	Thou shalt not be left a prisoner in this dismal spot while I have the power to help thee.
4294-35475-0014	He lifted the scissors, and with one stroke destroyed the web, and gave the fly its freedom.
4294-35475-0015	A faint glimmer of light on the opposite wall shows me the keyhole.
4294-35475-0016	The prince spent all the following time until midnight trying to think of a suitable verse to say to the scissors.
4294-35475-0017	As he uttered the words, the scissors leaped out of his hand and began to cut through the wooden shutters as easily as through its sheaves.
4294-35475-0018	In a very short time the prince had crawled through the opening.
4294-35475-0019	while he stood looking around him in bewilderment a firefly alighted on his arm flashing its little lantern in the prince's face it cried this way my friend the fly sent me to guide you to a place of safety
4294-35475-0020	"'What is to become of me?' cried the poor peasant.
4294-35475-0021	my grain must fall and rot in the field from over ripeness because i have not the strength to rise and harvest it then indeed must we all starve
4294-35475-0022	the grand dame whom he supplied with fagots the merchant whom he rescued from robbers the king's counsellor to whom he gave aid all became his friends up and down the land to beggar or lord homeless wanderer or high-born dame he gladly gave unselfish service all unsought and such as he helped straightway became his friends
4294-35475-0023	to him who could bring her back to her father's castle should be given the throne and kingdom as well as the princess herself so from far and near indeed from almost every country under the sun came knights and princes to fight the ogre
4294-35475-0024	Among those who drew back were Æthelred's brothers, the three that were dark and the three that were fair.
4294-35475-0025	But Æthelred heeded not their taunts.
4294-35475-0026	So they all cried out, long and loud, Long live the Prince! Prince is all!
4294-9934-0000	he felt what the earth may possibly feel at the moment when it is torn open with the iron in order that grain may be deposited within it it feels only the wound the quiver of the germ and the joy of the fruit only arrive later
4294-9934-0001	He had but just acquired a faith. Must he then reject it already?
4294-9934-0002	he affirmed to himself that he would not he declared to himself that he would not doubt and he began to doubt in spite of himself
4294-9934-0003	to stand between two religions from one of which you have not as yet emerged and another into which you have not yet entered is intolerable and twilight is pleasing only to bat-like souls
4294-9934-0004	Marius was clear-eyed, and he required the true light.
4294-9934-0005	The half-lights of doubt pained him.
4294-9934-0006	whatever may have been his desire to remain where he was he could not halt there he was irresistibly constrained to continue to advance to examine to think to march further
4294-9934-0007	he feared after having taken so many steps which had brought him nearer to his father to now take a step which should estrange him from that father
4294-9934-0008	His discomfort was augmented by all the reflections which occurred to him.
4294-9934-0009	In the troubled state of his conscience he no longer thought of certain serious sides of existence.
4294-9934-0010	"'They soon elbowed him abruptly.'
4294-9934-0011	"'Request Kerfarak to come and talk with me,' said Marius.
4294-9934-0012	"'What is to become of you?' said Ker-Ferak.
4294-9934-0013	What are you going to do? I do not know.
4294-9934-0014	Silver? Gold. Here it is.
4294-9934-0015	"'You will then have only a pair of trousers, "'a waistcoat, a hat, and a coat, "'and my boots.'
4294-9934-0016	That will be enough.
4294-9934-0017	"'No, it is not good. What will you do after that?'
4294-9934-0018	Do you know German? No.
4294-9934-0019	It is badly paid work, but one can live by it.
4294-9934-0020	The clothes dealer was sent for.
4294-9934-0021	He paid twenty francs for the cast-off garments. They went to the watchmakers.
4294-9934-0022	He bought the watch for forty-five francs.
4294-9934-0023	"'Hello. I had forgotten that,' said Marius.
4294-9934-0024	The landlord presented his bill, which had to be paid on the spot.
4294-9934-0025	"'I have ten francs left,' said Marius."
4294-9934-0026	that will be swallowing a tongue very fast, or a hundred sous very slowly.
4294-9934-0027	one morning on his return from the law school marius found a letter from his aunt and the sixty pistole that is to say six hundred francs in gold in a sealed box
4294-9934-0028	marius sent back the thirty louis to his aunt with a respectful letter in which he stated that he had sufficient means of subsistence and that he should be able thenceforth to supply all his needs
4294-9934-0029	At that moment he had three francs left.
4350-10919-0000	he perceived that it was no good talking to the old man and that the principal person in the house was the mother
4350-10919-0001	Before her, he decided to scatter his pearls.
4350-10919-0002	The princess was distracted and did not know what to do. She felt she had sinned against Kitty.
4350-10919-0003	"'Well, doctor, decide our fate,' said the princess. "'Tell me everything.'
4350-10919-0004	is there hope she meant to say but her lips quivered and she could not utter the question well doctor
4350-10919-0005	As you please. The princess went out with a sigh.
4350-10919-0006	The family doctor respectfully ceased in the middle of his observations.
4350-10919-0007	and there are indications malnutrition, nervous excitability, and so on.
4350-10919-0008	The question stands thus. In presence of indications of tuberculous process, what is to be done to maintain nutrition?
4350-10919-0009	Yes, that's an understood thing, responded the celebrated physician, again glancing at his watch.
4350-10919-0010	Beg pardon, is the Yoski bridge done yet, or shall I have to drive around?
4350-10919-0011	he asked. Ah, it is.
4350-10919-0012	Oh well, then I can do it in 20 minutes.
4350-10919-0013	And how about a tour abroad? asked the family doctor.
4350-10919-0014	What is wanted is the means of improving nutrition and not for lowering it.
4350-10919-0015	The family doctor listened attentively and respectfully.
4350-10919-0016	But in favor of foreign travel, I would urge the change of habits, the removal from conditions calling up reminiscences.
4350-10919-0017	And then the mother wishes it, he added.
4350-10919-0018	Ah, well in that case to be sure, let them go. Only those German quacks are mischievous.
4350-10919-0019	Oh, time's up already. And he went to the door.
4350-10919-0020	the celebrated doctor announced to the princess a feeling of what was due from him dictated his doing so that he ought to see the patient once more
4350-10919-0021	Oh no, only a few details, Princess. Come this way.
4350-10919-0022	and the mother accompanied by the doctor went into the drawing-room to kitty
4350-10919-0023	When the doctor came in, she flushed crimson, and her eyes filled with tears.
4350-10919-0024	She answered him, and all at once got up, furious.
4350-10919-0025	Excuse me, doctor, but there is really no object in this.
4350-10919-0026	This is the third time you've asked me the same thing.
4350-10919-0027	The celebrated doctor did not take offense.
4350-10919-0028	"'Nervous irritability,' he said to the princess, when Kitty had left the room. "'However, I had finished—'
4350-10919-0029	and the doctor began scientifically explaining to the princess as an exceptionally intelligent woman the condition of the young princess and concluded by insisting on the drinking of the waters which were certainly harmless
4350-10919-0030	At the question, should they go abroad, the doctor plunged into deep meditation, as though resolving a weighty problem.
4350-10919-0031	finally his decision was pronounced they were to go abroad but to put no faith in foreign quacks and to apply to him in any need
4350-10919-0032	It seemed as though some piece of good fortune had come to pass after the doctor had gone.
4350-10919-0033	The mother was much more cheerful when she went back to her daughter, and Kitty pretended to be more cheerful.
4350-9170-0000	Educated people of the upper classes are trying to stifle the ever-growing sense of the necessity of transforming the existing social order.
4350-9170-0001	This is absolutely incorrect.
4350-9170-0002	in the social conception of life it is supposed that since the aim of life is found in groups of individuals individuals will voluntarily sacrifice their own interests for the interests of the group
4350-9170-0003	The champions of the social conception of life usually try to connect the idea of authority, that is, of violence, with the idea of moral influence. But this connection is quite impossible.
4350-9170-0004	The man who is controlled by moral influence acts in accordance with his own desires.
4350-9170-0005	The basis of authority is bodily violence.
4350-9170-0006	The possibility of applying bodily violence to people is provided above all by an organization of armed men, trained to act in unison in submission to one will.
4350-9170-0007	these bands of armed men submissive to a single will are what constitute the army
4350-9170-0008	The army has always been, and still is, the basis of power.
4350-9170-0009	power is always in the hands of those who control the army and all men in power from the roman caesars to the russian and german emperors take more interest in their army than in anything and court popularity in the army knowing that if that is on their side their power is secure
4350-9170-0010	Indeed, it could not be otherwise.
4350-9170-0011	Only under those conditions could the social organization be justified.
4350-9170-0012	but since this is not the case and on the contrary men in power are always far from being saints through the very fact of their possession of power the social organization based on power has no justification
4350-9170-0013	even if there was once a time when owing to the low standards of morals and the disposition of men to violence the existence of an authority to restrain such violence was an advantage because the violence of the government was less than the violence of individuals one cannot but see that this advantage could not be lasting
4350-9170-0014	between the members of one state subject to a single authority the strife between the individuals seems still less and the life of the state seems even more secure
4350-9170-0015	It was produced, on one hand, by the natural growth of population, and, on the other, by struggle and conquest.
4350-9170-0016	After conquest, the power of the emperor puts an end to internal dissensions, and so the state conception of life justifies itself.
4350-9170-0017	But this justification is never more than temporary.
4350-9170-0018	Internal dissensions disappear only in proportion to the degree of oppression exerted by the authority over the dissentient individuals.
4350-9170-0019	government authority even if it does suppress private violence always introduces into the life of men fresh forms of violence which tend to become greater and greater in proportion to the duration and strength of the government
4350-9170-0020	and therefore the oppression of the oppressed always goes on growing up to the furthest limit beyond which it cannot go without killing the goose with the golden eggs
4350-9170-0021	the most convincing example of this is to be found in the condition of the working classes of our epoch who are in reality no better than the slaves of ancient times subdued by conquest
4350-9170-0022	So it has always been.
4350-9170-0023	footnote the fact that in america the abuses of authority exist in spite of the small number of their troops not only fails to disprove this position but positively confirms it
4350-9170-0024	the upper classes know that an army of fifty thousand will soon be insufficient and no longer relying on pinkerton's men they feel that the security of their position depends on the increased strength of the army
4350-9170-0025	the reason to which he gave expression is essentially the same as that which made the french kings and the popes engage swiss and scotch guards and makes the russian authorities of to-day so carefully distribute the recruits so that the regiments from the frontiers are stationed in central districts and the regiments from the centre are stationed on the frontiers
4350-9170-0026	the meaning of caprivi's speech put into plain language is that funds are needed not to resist foreign foes but to buy under-officers to be ready to act against the enslaved toiling masses
4350-9170-0027	and this abnormal order of things is maintained by the army.
4350-9170-0028	but there is not only one government there are other governments exploiting their subjects by violence in the same way and are always ready to pounce down on any other government and carry off the fruits of the toil of its enslaved subjects
4350-9170-0029	and so every government needs an army also to protect its booty from its neighbor brigands
4350-9170-0030	This increase is contagious, as Montesquieu pointed out 150 years ago.
4350-9170-0031	every increase in the army of one state with the aim of self-defense against its subjects becomes a source of danger for neighboring states and calls for a similar increase in their armies
4350-9170-0032	The despotism of a government always increases with the strength of the army and its external successes, and the aggressiveness of a government increases with its internal despotism.
4350-9170-0033	the rivalry of the european states in constantly increasing their forces has reduced them to the necessity of having recourse to universal military service since by that means the greatest possible number of soldiers is obtained at the least possible expense
4350-9170-0034	and by this means all citizens are under arms to support the iniquities practised upon them all citizens have become their own impressors
4350-9170-0035	This inconsistency has become obvious in universal military service.
4350-9170-0036	in fact the whole significance of the social conception of life consists in man's recognition of the barbarity of strife between individuals and the transitoriness of personal life itself and the transference of the aim of life to groups of persons
4350-9170-0037	but with universal military service it comes to pass that men after making every sacrifice to get rid of the cruelty of strife and the insecurity of existence are called upon to face all the perils they admit to avoid
4350-9170-0038	but instead of doing that they exposed the individuals to the same necessity of strife substituting strife with individuals of other states for strife with neighbors
4350-9170-0039	the taxes raised from the people for war preparations absorb the greater part of the produce of labor which the army ought to defend
4350-9170-0040	the danger of war ever ready to break out renders all reforms of life social life vain and fruitless
4350-9170-0041	but the fatal significance of universal military service as the manifestation of the contradiction inherent in the social conception of life is not only apparent in that
4350-9170-0042	Governments assert that armies are needed above all for external defense, but that is not true.
4350-9170-0043	they are needed principally against their subjects and every man under universal military service becomes an accomplice in all the acts of violence of the government against the citizens without any choice of his own
4350-9170-0044	and for the sake of what am i making them?
4350-9170-0045	i am expected for the sake of the state to make these sacrifices to renounce everything that can be precious to man peace family security and human dignity
4350-9170-0046	except for the state they say we should be exposed to the attacks of evil-disposed persons in our own country
4350-9170-0047	We now know that threats and punishments cannot diminish their number, that that can only be done by change of environment and moral influence.
4350-9170-0048	so that the justification of state violence on the ground of the protection it gives us from evil-disposed persons even if it had some foundation three or four centuries ago has none whatever now
4350-9170-0049	Except for the state, they tell us. We should not have any religion, education, culture, means of communication, and so on.
4350-9170-0050	Without the state, men would not have been able to form the social institutions needed for doing anything.
4350-9170-0051	This argument, too, was well founded only some centuries ago.
4350-9170-0052	the great extension of means of communication and interchange of ideas has made men completely able to dispense with state aid in forming societies associations corporations and congresses for scientific economic and political objects
4350-9170-0053	Without governments, nations would be enslaved by their neighbors.
4350-9170-0054	The government, they tell us, with its army, is necessary to defend us from neighboring states who might enslave us.
4350-9170-0055	and if defence against barbarous nations is meant one thousandth part of the troops now under arms would be amply sufficient for that purpose
4350-9170-0056	the power of the state far from being a security against the attacks of our neighbors exposes us on the contrary to much greater danger of such attacks
4350-9170-0057	even looking at it practically weighing that is to say all the burdens laid on him by the state no man can fail to see that for him personally to comply with the state demands and serve in the army would in the majority of cases be more disadvantageous than to refuse to do so
4350-9170-0058	To resist would need independent thought and effort, of which every man is not capable.
4350-9170-0059	so much for the advantages and disadvantages of both lines of conduct for a man of the wealthy class an oppressor
4350-9170-0060	for a man of the poorer working class the advantages and disadvantages will be the same but with a great increase of disadvantages
4852-28311-0000	Say, you know something?
4852-28311-0001	Chris looked from a nickel-plated flashlight to a car jack and spark plug.
4852-28311-0002	Know who needs a job bad? That's Jakey Harris.
4852-28311-0003	Okay, he said.
4852-28311-0004	Only why didn't you ask them yourself?
4852-28311-0005	mike became uneasy and fished an elastic band out of his pocket made a flick of paper and sent it soaring out into m street
4852-28311-0006	Well, he admitted, I did.
4852-28311-0007	Chris asked, and for the first time that day the heavy weight he carried within him lifted and lightened a little.
4852-28311-0008	Think he really needs it? He pursued.
4852-28311-0009	he would have liked to get the job for jakey who needed it but somehow the task of facing mr wicker especially now that the light was going and dusk edged into the streets was not what chris had intended for ending the afternoon
4852-28311-0010	Mike's expression changed at once to one of triumph, but Chris was only partially encouraged.
4852-28311-0011	Bitch aren't going after all. Just turned on him.
4852-28311-0012	Mike was standing on the corner.
4852-28311-0013	Aw, shucks.
4852-28311-0014	chris started off once more passing a bleak little victorian church perched on the hill above mr wicker's house
4852-28311-0015	an empty lot cut into by church lane gave a look of isolation to the l-shaped brick building that served mr wicker's both house and place of business
4852-28311-0016	the longer wing toward the back had a back door that opened on a water street the space between the house and wisconsin avenue had been made into a neat oblong flower garden fenced off from the sidewalk by box shrugs and a white picket fence
4852-28311-0017	a livid yellow stained the horizon beyond the factories and clay clouds lowered and tumbled above
4852-28311-0018	The air was growing chill and Chris decided to finish the job.
4852-28311-0019	All at once he wondered how his mother was, and everything in him impinched and tightened itself.
4852-28311-0020	At the foot of the hill he reached the house.
4852-28311-0021	There were three things that always caught his eye amid the litter of dusty pieces—
4852-28311-0022	on the left the coil of rope in the centre the model of a sailing ship in a green glass bottle and on the right the wooden statue of a negro boy in baggy trousers turkish jacket and white turban
4852-28311-0023	But the name still showed at the prow, and many a time Chris, safe at home in bed, had sailed imaginary voyages in the Mirabelle.
4852-28311-0024	He had never seen anyone go into Mr. Worker's shop now he thought of it.
4852-28311-0025	How then did he live? And what did he ever sell?
4852-28311-0026	a sudden car horn walking from the stream.
4852-28312-0000	of the many times he had examined mr worker's window and poured over the rope the ship and the nubian boy he had never gone into mr worker's shop
4852-28312-0001	So now, alone until someone should answer the bell, they looked eagerly, if uneasily, around him.
4852-28312-0002	What with the one window and the lowering day outside, the long narrow shop was sombre.
4852-28312-0003	heavy hand-hewn beams crossed it from one side to the other.
4852-28312-0004	Mr. Wicker's back being toward the source of light, Chris could not see his face.
4852-28312-0005	the double fans of minute wrinkles breaking from eye corner to temple and joining with those over the cheek bones were drawn into the horizontal lines across the domed forehead
4852-28312-0006	little tufts of white fuzz above the ears were all that remained of the antiquarian's hair but what drew and held chris's gaze were the old man's eyes
4852-28312-0007	Chris blinked and looked again. Yes, they were still there.
4852-28312-0008	Chris swallowed and his voice came back to him.
4852-28312-0009	Yes, sir, he said.
4852-28312-0010	I saw your sign and I know a boy who needs the job.
4852-28312-0011	He's a schoolmate of mine.
4852-28312-0012	Jake Harris's name is and he really needs the job.
4852-28312-0013	I... I just wondered if the place was still open.
4852-28312-0014	what he saw was a fresh-cheeked lad tall for thirteen sturdy with sincerity and good-humour in his face and something sensitive and appealing about his eyes
4852-28312-0015	he guessed there must be a lively fire in that room beyond
4852-28312-0016	Would that interfere with Jakey getting the job, sir?
4852-28312-0017	but even as he slowly turned the thought pierced his mind why had he not seen the reflection of the headlights of the cars moving up around the corner of walters street not the hill toward the traffic signals
4852-28312-0018	The room seemed overly still.
4852-28312-0019	Then in that second he turned and faced about.
4852-28312-0020	the wide bow window was there before him and three objects he liked best showing frosty in the moonlight that poured in from across the water
4852-28312-0021	Across the water? Where was the freeway?
4852-28312-0022	It was no longer there, nor were the high walls and smokestacks of factories to be seen.
4852-28312-0023	the warehouses were still there
4852-28312-0024	Flabbergasted and breathless, Chris was unaware that he had moved closer to peer out the window in every direction.
4852-28312-0025	No electric signs, no lamp-lit streets,
4852-28312-0026	where the people's drug store had stood but half an hour before rose the roofs of what was evidently an inn
4852-28312-0027	a courtyard was firstly lit by a flaring torch or two showing a swinging sign hung on a post
4852-28312-0028	The post was planted at the edge of what was now a broad and muddy road.
4852-28312-0029	A coach with its top piled high with luggage stamped to a halt beside the flagged courtyard.
4852-28312-0030	They moved into the inn, and the coach rattled off to the stable.
4852-28312-0031	My window has a power for those few who are to see.
4852-28319-0000	The learning of magic was by no means easy.
4852-28319-0001	He had told his master at once about Simon Goslar, his hoard of money and his hiding places for it.
4852-28319-0002	Chris therefore threw himself and all the preliminaries in his task
4852-28319-0003	one afternoon when he had returned after a rest to mr wicker's study he saw that there was something new in the room a bowl with a goldfish in it stood on the table but mr wicker was not to be seen
4852-28319-0004	What should I do first?
4852-28319-0005	"'How you've improved, my boy!' he exclaimed. "'It is now time for you to try. This is as good a change as any.'
4852-28319-0006	Suppose I change and can't change back.
4852-28319-0007	Mr. Worker waited patiently beside him for a few moments for Chris to get up his courage.
4852-28319-0008	Then as nothing happened, with a voice like a whip, Mr. Wicker said, Start it once!
4852-28319-0009	The sensation spread faster and faster.
4852-28319-0010	His head swam and he felt faint and a little sick, but he persisted through the final words.
4852-28319-0011	he thought not without a feeling of pride and commenced experimenting with his tail and fins with such enthusiasm and delight that some little time elapsed before mr wicker's voice boomed but
4852-28319-0012	74, Book 1, The Return.
4852-28319-0013	the figure's shoes carved in some eastern style and curved up pointing toes
4852-28319-0014	Then all at once the idea came to Chris.
4852-28319-0015	If he was to be a magician, could he make this boy come to life?
4852-28319-0016	he squatted on his haunches examined the carved wooden figure attentively and felt convinced that once alive the boy would be an ideal and happy companion
4852-28319-0017	But how did one change inanimate to animate?
4852-28319-0018	Chris got up and stole back to Mr. Worker's door.
4852-28319-0019	he heard the magician going up the spiral staircase to his room above and after changing himself to a mouse to slip under the door and see that the room was really empty mr james's proper shape and opened the doors of the cupboard at the far end of the room
4852-28319-0020	the afternoon raining before increased in storm
4852-28319-0021	Thus came, two hours before its time, Thunder snarls in the sky.
4852-28319-0022	Certain elements were to be mixed and poured at the proper time,
4852-28319-0023	mr worker began moving about upstairs the floorboards creaked creak creak and still chris could not leave until the potion fumed and glowed
4852-28319-0024	with infinite caution chris closed the door silently behind him and running lightly forward reached the figure of the negro boy
4852-28319-0025	It was as if the stiffness melted.
4852-28319-0026	under his eyes wettened folds of cloth became rich silk embroidery gleamed in its reality upon the coat and oh the face
4852-28319-0027	the wooden grin loosened the large eyes turned the hand holding the hard bouquet of carved flowers moved let the bouquet fall
4852-28330-0000	They went down to their quarters first.
4852-28330-0001	"'Guess Mr. Finney went to his quarters. "'I don't remember seeing him cross the deck "'or come over that way at all.'
4852-28330-0002	Next, Ned Silly was relieved of the helm by Elber Jones, who took over. Ned went on down.
4852-28330-0003	It looks to me as if it could have been one of several people, and I'll be switched if I know who. I'll keep my eyes open.
4852-28330-0004	The Mirabelle was nearing Tahiti.
4852-28330-0005	We've water and fresh stores to tick on there.
4852-28330-0006	Chris lost no time as soon as he could do it without being noticed in hurrying down to his cabin.
4852-28330-0007	Certainly, my boy," boomed out the captain, his blue eyes abruptly keen and penetrating.
4852-28330-0008	Mr. Finnear will be sometime on deck. We cannot be heard in here.
4852-28330-0009	his face rose with nervousness that this might not do as an answer and he stood stiff and still before captain blizzard
4852-28330-0010	The captain sat forward in his chair, looking at him for a long moment, considering.
4852-28330-0011	Then he said, well, I do not care for it. I cannot say that I do.
4852-28330-0012	This ship is more to me than wife or mother or family.
4852-28330-0013	He paused, fingering his lower lip and looking sideways in a reflective fashion at Chris standing before him.
4852-28330-0014	We shall say no more, but I trust you understand the responsibility you have.
4852-28330-0015	This ship, its cargo and its men will be in your hands.
4852-28330-0016	Yes, sir. I think I can do it safely. Or I should not try, sir.
4852-28330-0017	Captain Blizzard's round pink face creased in its winning smile.
4852-28330-0018	He then went on to describe what else was to follow, the covering of the ship with leaves to make it blend with its surroundings.
4852-28330-0019	Camouflage was not a word the captain or anyone else of his time yet understood.
4852-28330-0020	"'What can be said during that time, sir?' Chris thought to ask.
4852-28330-0021	i am somewhat skilled in medicaments i have to be as captain of a ship and the crew know it
4852-28330-0022	I shall say that you are in my own cabin so that I can care for you.
4852-28330-0023	not since he had left mr wicker and chris felt such confidence as he did in the words and actions of captain blizzard
4852-28330-0024	He knew now that his absence, for as long as he had to be away, would be covered up and satisfactorily accounted for.
4852-28330-0025	Their conversation had taken some of the while.
533-1066-0000	when churchyards yawn.
533-1066-0001	i knew well enough that he might be carried thousands of miles in the box-car locked in perhaps without water or food
533-1066-0002	i am sure i kissed lady and i've had terrible moments since when i seem to remember kissing mr jameson too in the excitement
533-1066-0003	Fortunately, Warner and the detective were keeping Bachelor Hall in the lodge.
533-1066-0004	out of deference to lydie they washed her dishes once a day and they concocted queer messes according to their several abilities
533-1066-0005	"'Miss Innes,' he said, stopping me as I was about to go to my room upstairs. "'How are your nerves to-night?'
533-1066-0006	"'I have none,' I said happily.
533-1066-0007	"'I mean,' he persisted, "'do you feel as though you could go through with something rather unusual?'
533-1066-0008	The most unusual thing I can think of would be a peaceful night.
533-1066-0009	something is going to occur he said
533-1066-0010	Put on heavy shoes and some old dark clothes and make up your mind not to be surprised at anything.
533-1066-0011	Lily was sleeping the sleep of the just when I went upstairs, and I hunted out my things cautiously.
533-1066-0012	They were talking conveniently together, but when I came down they ceased.
533-1066-0013	there were a few preparations to be made the logs to be gone over winters to be instructed as to renewed vigilance and then after extinguishing the whole light we crept in the darkness through the front door and into the night
533-1066-0014	I ask no questions.
533-1066-0015	once only somebody spoke and then it was an emphatic bit of profanity from dr stewart when he ran into a wire fence
533-1066-0016	I hardly know what I expected.
533-1066-0017	The doctor was puffing somewhat when we finally came to a halt.
533-1066-0018	I confess that just at that minute even Sunnyside seemed a cheerful spot.
533-1066-0019	Inspired of myself, I drew my breath in sharply.
533-1066-0020	It was Alex, armed with two long-handled spades.
533-1066-0021	The doctor kept a keen lookout, but no one appeared.
533-1066-0022	There's one thing sure. I'll not be suspected of complicity.
533-1066-0023	A doctor is generally supposed to be a handier at bearing folks than at jigging them up.
533-1066-0024	I held onto him frantically, and somehow I got there and looked down.
533-131556-0000	But how am I to get over the 10 or 12 days that must yet elapse before they go?
533-131556-0001	For none could injure me as he has done. Oh!
533-131556-0002	The word stares me in the face like a guilty confession, but it is true. I hate him. I hate him.
533-131556-0003	i sometimes think i ought to give him credit for the good feeling he simulated so well and then again i think it is my duty to suspect him under the peculiar circumstances in which i am placed
533-131556-0004	I have done well to record them so minutely.
533-131556-0005	they had taken themselves to their work i less to divert my mind than to deprecate conversation had provided myself with a book
533-131556-0006	i am too well acquainted with your character and conduct to feel any real friendship for you and as i am without your talent for dissimulation i cannot assume the appearance of it
533-131556-0007	Upon perusing this, she turned scarlet and bit her lip.
533-131556-0008	You may go, Millicent, until following a while." Millicent went.
533-131556-0009	"'Will you bless me, Ellen?' continued she.
533-131556-0010	You are suspicious.
533-131556-0011	If I were suspicious, I replied, I should have discovered your infamy long before.
533-131556-0012	i enjoy a mellent ramble as well as you i answered steadily fixing my eyes up on her and the friary happens to be one of my favorite resorts
533-131556-0013	She colored again excessively and remained silent, pressing her finger against her teeth and gazing into the fire.
533-131556-0014	i watched her a few moments to the feeling of malevolent gratification then moving towards the door i calmly asked if she had anything more to say
533-131556-0015	Yes, yes.
533-131556-0016	suppose i do
533-131556-0017	She paused, in evident disconcertion and perplexity, mingled with anger she dared not show.
533-131556-0018	i cannot renounce what is dearer than life she muttered in a low hurried tone
533-131556-0019	if you are generous here is a fitting opportunity for the exercise of your magnanimity if you are proud here am i your rival ready to acknowledge myself your adopter for an act of the most noble forbearance
533-131556-0020	"'I shall not tell him.'
533-131556-0021	Give me no thanks. It is not for your sake that I refrain.
533-131556-0022	"'And Millicent? Will you tell her?'
533-131556-0023	I would not for much that you should know the infamy and disgrace of a relation.
533-131556-0024	"'You use hard words, Mrs. Huntingdon, but I can pardon you.'
533-131556-0025	How dare you mention his name to me?
533-131562-0000	it seems very interesting love said he lifting his head and turning to where i stood wringing my hand in silent rage and anguish but it's rather long i'll look at it some other time and meanwhile i'll trouble you for your kiss my dear what kiss
533-131562-0001	the keys of your cabinet desk drawer and whatever else you possess said he rising and holding out his hand
533-131562-0002	The key of my desk, in fact, was at that moment in the log, and the others were attached to it.
533-131562-0003	now then sneered he we must have a confiscation of property
533-131562-0004	and putting the keys into his pocket, he walked into the library.
533-131562-0005	"'That and all,' replied the master, and the things were cleared away.'
533-131562-0006	Mr. Huntington then went upstairs.
533-131562-0007	Not that he is starting back. She's very devil for spite.
533-131562-0008	I didn't say I'd broken it, did I? returned he.
533-131562-0009	i shall put you up on a small monthly allowance in future for your own private expenses and you needn't trouble yourself any more about my concerns i shall look out for a steward my dear i won't expose you to the temptation
533-131562-0010	and as for the household matters mrs gribbs must be very particular in keeping her accounts we must go up on an entirely new plan
533-131562-0011	what great discovery have you made now mr honhinen
533-131562-0012	Have I attempted to defraud you?
533-131562-0013	Not in money matters exactly, it seems, but it's best to keep out of the way of temptation.
533-131562-0014	here benson entered the candles and there followed a brief interval of silence i sitting still in my chair and he standing with his back to the fire silently triumphing in my despair
533-131562-0015	I know that day after day such feelings will return upon me.
533-131562-0016	I try to look to him and raise my heart to heaven, but it will cleave to the dust.
533-131564-0000	vain hope i fear
533-131564-0001	mr and mrs hattersley have been seeing it to grow before at night and as mr hargrave is still absent and the weather was remarkably fine i never passed a day without seeing my two friends millicent and esther either there or here
533-131564-0002	No, unless you can tell me when to expect him home.
533-131564-0003	"'I can't.' "'You don't want him, do you?'
533-131564-0004	It is a resolution you are performed long ago.
533-131564-0005	We all have a bit of a liking for him at the bottom of our hearts, though we can't respect him.
533-131564-0006	No, I'd rather be like myself, bad as I am.
533-131564-0007	"'Never mind my plain speaking,' said I. "'It is from the best of motives.'
533-131564-0008	But tell me, should you wish your sons to be like Mr. Huntingdon, or even like yourself?
533-131564-0009	Oh no, I couldn't stand that.
533-131564-0010	Fire and Fury
533-131564-0011	Now, don't pour us into a tempest at that.
533-131564-0012	But hang it, that's not my fault.
533-131564-0013	Not ears, for she's only five-and-twenty.
533-131564-0014	What did you make of me and the children to be sure that were you hurt death between them?
533-131564-0015	I know they are. Bless them.
533-131564-0016	He followed me into the library.
533-131564-0017	i sought out and put into his hands two of millicent's letters one dated from london and written during one of his wildest seasons of reckless dissipation the other in the country during a lucid interval
533-131564-0018	the former was full of trouble and anguish not accusing him but deeply regretting his connection with his profligate companions abusing mr grimsby and others insinuating bitter things against mr huntingdon and most ingenuously throwing the blame of her husband's misconduct on the other man's shoulders
533-131564-0019	i've been a cursed rascal god knows said he as he gave it a earthy squeeze but you see if i don't make amends for it d-n me if i don't
533-131564-0020	If you intend to reform, invoke God's blessing, His mercy and His aid, not His curse.
533-131564-0021	God help me then, for I'm sure I need it.
533-131564-0022	"'Where's Millicent?'
533-131564-0023	nay not i said he turning around and pushing it towards me
533-131564-0024	Millicent flew to thank me, overwhelming its gratitude.
533-131564-0025	cried she. I couldn't have influenced him, I'm sure, by anything that I could have said.
533-131564-0026	"'You never tried me, Millie,' said he.
533-131564-0027	After that they will prepare to their country home.
5442-32873-0000	"'Captain Lake did not look at all like a London dandy now.'
5442-32873-0001	there was a very natural savagery and dejection there and a wild lure in his yellow eyes rachel sat down
5442-32873-0002	A slave, only think, a slave.
5442-32873-0003	Oh, frightful, frightful! Is it a dream?
5442-32873-0004	Oh, frightful, frightful.
5442-32873-0005	"'Stanley! Stanley! It would be mercy to kill me!' She broke her again.
5442-32873-0006	bright and natty were the chintz curtains and the little toilet set out not inelegantly and her pet piping goldfinch asleep on his perch with his bit of sugar between the wires of his cage her pillow so white and unpressed with its little edging of lace
5442-32873-0007	when he came back to the drawing-room a toilet-bottle of eau-de-cologne in his hand with her lace handkerchief he bathed her temples and forehead
5442-32873-0008	There was nothing very brotherly in his look, as he peered into her pale, sharp features during the process.
5442-32873-0009	there don't mind me she said sharply and getting up she looked down at her dress and thin shoes and seeming to recollect herself she took the candle he had just set down and went swiftly to her room
5442-32873-0010	and she threw back her veil, and going hurriedly to the toilet, mechanically surveyed herself in the glass.
5442-32873-0011	Rachel Leake, Rachel Leake, what are you now?
5442-32873-0012	"'I'll stay here, that is, in the drawing-room,' she answered, and the face was withdrawn.
5442-32873-0013	he slackened his pace and tapped sharply at the little window of that modest post-office at which the young ladies in the pony carriage had pulled up the day before and within which luke waggett was wont to sleep in a sort of wooden box that folded up and appeared to be a chest of drawers all day
5442-32873-0014	luke took care of mr larkin's dogs and groomed mr wilder's horse and cleaned up his dog-cart for mark being close about money and finding that the thing was to be done more cheaply that way put up his horse and dog-cart in the post-office premises and so evaded the livery charges of the brandon arms
5442-32873-0015	but luke was not there and captain lake recollecting his habits and his haunt hurried on to the silver lion which has its cable towards the common only about a hundred steps away for distances are not great in
5442-32873-0016	here where the flow of sole and of stout long pipes long yarns and tolerably long credits and the humble cape graces of the town resorted thither for the pleasures of a club life and often revelled deep into the small hours of the morning
5442-32873-0017	Lose no time and I'll give you half a crown.
5442-32873-0018	luke stuck on his greasy wide-awake and in a few minutes more the dog-cart was trundled out into the lane and the horse harnessed went between the shafts with that wonderful cheerfulness with which they bear to be called up under startling circumstances at unseasonable hours
5442-32873-0019	If I thought you'd fail me now, Tamar, I should never come back. Good night, Tamar.
5442-41168-0000	The Act said that, in case of difference of opinion, there must be a ballot.
5442-41168-0001	He went up to the table, and striking it with his finger-ring, he shouted loudly,
5442-41168-0002	he was shouting for the very course sergey ivanovitch had proposed but it was evident that he hated him and all his party and this feeling of hatred spread through the whole party and roused in opposition to it the same vindictiveness though in a more seemly form on the other side
5442-41168-0003	shouts were raised and for a moment all was confusion so that the marshal of the province had to call for order a ballot
5442-41168-0004	We shed our blood for our country.
5442-41168-0005	The confidence of the monarch. No checking the accounts of the marshal. He's not a cashier. But that's not the point.
5442-41168-0006	Votes please. Peace.
5442-41168-0007	They expressed the most implacable hatred.
5442-41168-0008	levin did not in the least understand what was the matter and he marvelled at the passion with which it was disputed whether or not the decision about fleuroff should be put to the vote
5442-41168-0009	He forgot, as Sergei Ivanovich explained to him afterwards, this syllogism, that it was necessary for the public good to get rid of the marshal of the province, that to get rid of the marshal it was necessary to have a majority of votes, that to get a majority of votes it was necessary to secure Flerov's right to vote, that to secure the recognition of Flerov's right to vote they must decide on the interpretation to be put on the act.
5442-41168-0010	but levin forgot all that and it was painful to him to see all these excellent persons for whom he had a respect in such an unpleasant and vicious state of excitement
5442-41168-0011	To escape from this painful feeling, he went away into the other room, where there was nobody except the waiters at the refreshment bar.
5442-41168-0012	he particularly liked the way one grey-whiskered waiter who showed a scorn for the other younger ones and was jeered at by them was teaching them how to fold up napkins properly
5442-41168-0013	levin advanced but utterly forgetting what he was to do and much embarrassed he turned to sergey ivanovitch with the question where am i to put it
5442-41168-0014	Sergei Ivanovich frowned.
5442-41168-0015	"'That is a matter for each man's own decision,' he said severely.
5442-41168-0016	having put it in he recollected that he ought to have thrust his left hand too and so he thrust it in though too late and still more overcome with confusion he beat a hasty retreat into the background
5442-41168-0017	126 for admission, 98 against.
5442-41168-0018	sang over the voice of the secretary, who could not pronounce the letter R.
5442-41168-0019	Then there was a laugh. A button and two knots were found in the box.
5442-41168-0020	But the old party did not consider themselves conquered.
5442-41168-0021	in reply snitkov spoke of the trust the noblemen of the province had placed in him the affection they had shown him which he did not deserve as his only merit had been his attachment to the nobility to whom he had devoted twelve years of service
5442-41168-0022	this expression in the marshal's face was particularly touching to levin because only the day before he had been at his house about his trusty business and had seen him in all his grandeur a kind-hearted fatherly man
5442-41168-0023	If there are men younger and more deserving than I, let them serve.
5442-41168-0024	and the marshal disappeared through a side door.
5442-41168-0025	They were to proceed immediately to the election.
5442-41168-0026	two noble gentlemen who had a weakness for strong drink had been made drunk by the partisans of snedkov and a third had been robbed of his uniform
5442-41168-0027	on learning this the new party had made haste during the dispute about fleuroff to send some of their men in a sledge to clothe the stripped gentleman and to bring along one of the intoxicated to the meeting
5442-41169-0000	levin did not care to eat and he was not smoking he did not want to join his own friends that is sergey ivanovitch stepan arkadyevitch sversky and the rest because vronsky in his equerry's uniform was standing with them in eager conversation
5442-41169-0001	He went to the window and sat down, scanning the groups and listening to what was being said around him.
5442-41169-0002	He's such a blackguard.
5442-41169-0003	I have told him so, but it makes no difference. Only think of it.
5442-41169-0004	These persons were unmistakably seeking a place where they could talk without being overheard.
5442-41169-0005	Shall we go on, Your Excellency? Fine champagne?
5442-41169-0006	last year at our district marshal Nikola Ivanovich's.
5442-41169-0007	oh still just the same always at a loss the landowner answered with a resigned smile but with an expression of serenity and conviction that so it must be
5442-41169-0008	Why? What is there to understand?
5442-41169-0009	There is no meaning in it at all
5442-41169-0010	Then too, one must keep up connections
5442-41169-0011	It's a moral obligation of Assad.
5442-41169-0012	and then, to tell the truth, there's one's own interests.
5442-41169-0013	They are proprietors of a sod, but we are the landowners.
5442-41169-0014	that it may be but still it ought to be treated a little more respectfully
5442-41169-0015	if we are laying out a garden planning one before the house you know and there you have a tree that stood for centuries in the very spot old and gnarled it may be and yet you don't cut down the old fellow to make room for the flower beds but lay out your beds so as to take advantage of the tree
5442-41169-0016	Well, and how is your land doing?
5442-41169-0017	But one's work is thrown in for nothing.
5442-41169-0018	Oh well, one does it. What would you have?
5442-41169-0019	and what's more the landowner went on leaning his elbows on the window and chatting on my son i must tell you has no taste for it
5442-41169-0020	So there will be no one to keep it up. And yet one does it.
5442-41169-0021	we walked about the fields and the garden no said he stepan vassilievich everything's well looked after but your garden's neglected
5442-41169-0022	To my thinking, I'd cut down the lime tree.
5442-41169-0023	Here you have thousands of limes and each would make two good bundles of bark.
5442-41169-0024	"'You're married, I heard,' said the landowner.
5442-41169-0025	Yes, it's rather strange, he went on.
5442-41169-0026	The landowner chuckled under his white moustaches.
5442-41169-0027	Why don't we cut down our parks for timber?
5442-41169-0028	said Levin, returning to a thought that had struck him.
5442-41169-0029	There's a class instinct, too, of what one ought and ought not to do.
5442-41169-0030	there's the peasants too i wonder at them sometimes any good peasant tries to take all the land he can
5442-41169-0031	Without a return 2, add a simple loss.
5484-24317-0000	When he came from the bath, Proclus visited him again.
5484-24317-0001	but hermann was not in the mood to share a joyous revel and he frankly said so although immediately after his return he had accepted the invitation to the festival which the whole fellowship of artists would give the following day in honor of the seventieth birthday of the old sculptor
5484-24317-0002	She would appear herself at dessert, and the banquet must therefore begin at an unusually early hour.
5484-24317-0003	So the artist found himself obliged to relinquish his opposition
5484-24317-0004	The banquet was to begin in a few hours, yet he could not let the day pass without seeing Daphne and telling her the words of the oracle.
5484-24317-0005	He longed, with ardent yearning, for the sound of her voice, and still more to unburden his sorely troubled soul to her.
5484-24317-0006	Since his return from the oracle, the fear that the rescued Demeter might yet be the work of Myrtillus had again mastered him.
5484-24317-0007	the approval as well as the doubts which had arised in others strengthened his opinion although even now he could not succeed in bringing it into harmony with the facts
5484-24317-0008	Then he went directly to the neighboring palace. The queen might have appeared already, and it would not do to keep her waiting.
5484-24317-0009	hitherto the merchant had been induced it is true to advance large sums of money to the queen but the loyal devotion which he showed to her royal husband had rendered it impossible to give him even a hint of the conspiracy
5484-24317-0010	When Hermon entered the residence of the Gramatius in the palace, the guests had already assembled.
5484-24317-0011	The place by Hermon's side, which Althea had chosen for herself, would then be given up to Arsinoe.
5484-24317-0012	true an interesting conversation still had power to charm him but often during its continuance the full consciousness of his misfortune forced itself upon his mind for the majority of the subjects discussed by the artists came to them through the medium of sight and referred to new creations of architecture sculpture and painting from whose enjoyment his blindness debarred him
5484-24317-0013	a stranger out of his own sphere he fell child among these closely united men and women to whom no tie bound him save the presence of the same host
5484-24317-0014	crates had really been invited in order to win him over to the queen's cause but charming fair herod nico had been commissioned by the conspirators to persuade him to sing arsinoe's praises among his professional associates
5484-24317-0015	His son had been the royal dame's first husband, and she had deserted him to marry Lysimachus, the aged king of Thrace.
5484-24317-0016	"'The king's sister, the object of his love,' cried Harmon incredulously.
5484-24317-0017	we women are only as old as we look and the leeches and tyrant women of this beauty of forty practise arts which give her the appearance of twenty-five yet perhaps the king values her intellect more than her person and the wisdom of a hundred serpents is certainly united in this woman's head
5484-24317-0018	The three most trustworthy ones are here. Amintus, the leech Chrysippus, and the admirable Proclus.
5484-24317-0019	Let us hope that you will make this three-leaved clover the luck-promising four-leaved one.
5484-24317-0020	"'Your uncle, too, has often with praiseworthy generosity "'helped Arsinoe in many an embarrassment.'
5484-24317-0021	"'How long!' he kept you waiting from the first word concerning a work, "'which justly transported the whole city with delight.'
5484-24317-0022	When he did finally summon you, he said things which must have wounded you.
5484-24317-0023	"'That is going too far,' replied Hermon.
5484-24317-0024	he winked at her and made a significant gesture as he spoke and then informed the blind artist how graciously arsinoe had remembered him when she heard of the remedy by whose aid many a wonderful cure of blind eye had been made in rhodes
5484-24317-0025	The royal lady had inquired about him and his sufferings with almost sisterly interest, and Althea eagerly confirmed the statement.
5484-24317-0026	Her mom listened to the pair in silence.
5484-24317-0027	the radian was just beginning to praise arsinoe also as a special friend and connoisseur of the sculptor's art when kreutz hermann's fellow student asked the blind artist in behalf of his beautiful companion why his demeter was placed upon a pedestal which to others as well as himself seemed too high for the size of the statue
5484-24317-0028	Yet what mattered it, even if these miserable people considered themselves deceived and pointed the finger of scorn at him?
5484-24317-0029	A woman who yearns for the regard of all men and makes love a toy easily lessens the demands she imposes upon individuals.
5484-24317-0030	Only, even though love has wholly disappeared, she still claims consideration, and Althea did not wish to lose Hermon's regard.
5484-24317-0031	how indifferent you look but i tell you her deep blue eyes flashed as she spoke that so long as you were still a genuine creating artist the case was different
5484-24317-0032	though so loud a denial is written on your face i persist in my conviction and that no idle delusion ensnars me i can prove
5484-24317-0033	It was—nay, it could have been nothing else—that very spider.
5484-24318-0000	Not a sound if you value your lives.
5484-24318-0001	to offer resistance would have been madness for even hermon perceived by the loud clanking of weapons around them the greatly superior power of the enemy and they were acting by the orders of the king to the prison near the place of execution
5484-24318-0002	Was he to be led to the executioner's block?
5484-24318-0003	What pleasure had life to offer him, the blind man, who was already dead to his art?
5484-24318-0004	Ought he not to greet his sudden end as a boon from the immortals?
5484-24318-0005	Did it not spare him a humiliation as great and painful as could be imagined?
5484-24318-0006	Whatever might await him, he desired no better fate.
5484-24318-0007	if he had passed into annihilation he hermon wished to follow him thither and annihilation certainly meant redemption from pain and misery
5484-24318-0008	but if he were destined to meet his myrtiless and his mother in the world beyond the grave what had he not to tell them how sure he was of finding a joyful reception there from both
5484-24318-0009	the power which delivered him over to death just at that moment was not nemesis no it was a kindly deity
5484-24318-0010	Yet it was no illusion that deceived him.
5484-24318-0011	Again he heard the beloved voice, and this time it addressed not only him, but with the utmost haste the commander of the soldiers.
5484-24318-0012	sometimes with touching entreaty sometimes with imperious command she protested after giving him her name that this matter could be nothing but an unfortunate mistake
5484-24318-0013	lastly with earnest warmth she besought him before taking the prisoners away to permit her to speak to the commanding general philippus her father's guest who she was certain was in the palace
5484-24318-0014	cried harriman in grateful agitation but she would not listen to him and followed the soldier whom the captain detailed to guide her into the palace
5484-24318-0015	To-morrow you shall confess to me who treacherously directed you to this dangerous path."
5484-24318-0016	daphne again pleaded for the liberation of the prisoners but philippa's silence charred with a grave exclamation the order of the king
5484-24318-0017	as soon as the captive artist was alone with the woman he loved he clasped her hand pouring forth incoherent words of the most ardent gratitude and when he felt her warmly return the pressure he could not restrain the desire to clasp her to his heart
5484-24318-0018	In spite of his deep mental distress, he could have shouted aloud in his delight and gratitude.
5484-24318-0019	he might now have been permitted to bind for ever to his life the woman who had just rescued him from the greatest danger but the confession he must make to his fellow artists in the paluster the following morning still sealed his lips yet in this hour he felt that he was united to her and ought not to conceal what awaited him so obeying a strong impulse he exclaimed you know that i love you
5484-24318-0020	I love you and have loved you always.
5484-24318-0021	Daphne exclaimed tenderly, "'What more is needed?'
5484-24318-0022	but hermon with drooping head murmured to-morrow i shall no longer be what i am now
5484-24318-0023	Then Daphne raised her face to his, asking, "'So the Demeter is the work of Myrtilus?'
5484-24318-0024	What a terrible ordeal again awaits you.
5484-24318-0025	And I, fool, blinded also in mind, Could be vexed with you for it.
5484-24318-0026	bring this before your mind and everything else that you must accept with it if you consent when the time arrives to become mine conceal and palliate nothing
5484-24318-0027	Sorakais intended to leave the city on one of his own ships that very day.
5484-24318-0028	He himself on the way to expose himself to the malice and mockery of the whole city.
5484-24318-0029	his heart contracted painfully and his solicitude about his uncle's fate increased when philippus informed him that the conspirators had been arrested at the banquet and headed by amyntas the rhodian chrysippus and proclos had perished by the executioner's sword at sunrise
5484-24318-0030	Besides, he knew that the object of his love would not part from him without granting him one last word.
5484-24318-0031	On the way his heart throbbed almost to bursting.
5484-24318-0032	Even Daphne's image, and what threatened her father and her with him, receded far into the background.
5484-24318-0033	He was appearing before his companions only to give truth, it's just due.
5484-24318-0034	The Egyptian obeyed, and his master crossed the wide space, strewn with sand, and approached the stage which had been erected for the Feastal performances. Even had his eyes retained the power of sight, his blood was coursing so wildly through his veins that he might perhaps have been unable to distinguish the statues around him and the thousands of spectators who, crowded closely together, richly garlanded, their cheeks glowing with enthusiasm, surrounded the arena. "'Hermon!'
5484-24318-0035	shouted his friend satylus in joyful surprise in the midst of his painful walk hermon
5484-24318-0036	even while he believed himself to be the creator of the demeter he had been seriously troubled by the praise of so many critics because it had exposed him to the suspicion of having become faithless to his art and his nature
5484-24318-0037	honor to mertilus and his art but he trusted this noble feast of assemblage would pardon the unintentional deception and aid his prayer for recovery
5764-299665-0000	afterward it was supposed that he was satisfied with the blood of oxen lambs and doves and that in exchange for or in account of these sacrifices this god gave rain sunshine and harvest
5764-299665-0001	Whether he was the creator of yourself and myself,
5764-299665-0002	whether any prayer was ever answered.
5764-299665-0003	Why did he create the intellectually inferior?
5764-299665-0004	Why did he create the deformed and helpless? Why did he create the criminal, the idiotic, the insane?
5764-299665-0005	are the failures and the obligations to their Creator.
5764-299665-0006	is he responsible for all the wars that have been waged for all the innocent blood that has been shed
5764-299665-0007	is he responsible for the centuries of slavery for the backs that have been scarred with a lash for the babes that have been sold from the breasts of mothers for the families that have been separated and destroyed
5764-299665-0008	is this god responsible for religious persecution for the inquisition for the thumb-screw and rack and for all the instruments of torture
5764-299665-0009	Did this god allow the cruel and vile to destroy the brave and virtuous?
5764-299665-0010	Did he allow tyrants to shed the blood of patriots?
5764-299665-0011	Can we conceive of a devil base enough to prefer his enemies to his friends?
5764-299665-0012	how can we account for the wild beasts that devour human beings for the fanged serpents whose bite is death
5764-299665-0013	How can we account for a world where life feeds on life?
5764-299665-0014	did infinite wisdom intentionally produce the microscopic beasts that feed upon the optic nurse think of blinding a man to satisfy the appetite of a microbe
5764-299665-0015	Fear builds the altar and offers the sacrifice.
5764-299665-0016	Fear erects the cathedral and bows the head of man in worship.
5764-299665-0017	lips religious and fearful tremblingly repeat this passage though he slay me yet will i trust him
5764-299665-0018	Can we say that he cared for the children of men
5764-299665-0019	Can we say that His mercy endured forever?
5764-299665-0020	do we prove his goodness by showing that he has opened the earth and swallowed thousands of his helpless children or that with the volcanoes he has overwhelmed them with rivers of fire
5764-299665-0021	Was there goodness? Was there wisdom in this?
5764-299665-0022	all the superior race to thank God that they are not the inferior.
5764-299665-0023	Most people cling to the supernatural.
5764-299665-0024	If they give up one god, they imagine another.
5764-299665-0025	What is this power?
5764-299665-0026	Man advances and necessarily advances through experience.
5764-299665-0027	A man, wishing to go to a certain place, comes to where the road divides.
5764-299665-0028	He has tried that road and knows that it is the wrong road.
5764-299665-0029	a child shunned by the beauty of the flame grasped it with his dimpled hand
5764-299665-0030	The power that works for righteousness had taught the child a lesson.
5764-299665-0031	It is a result.
5764-299665-0032	it is insisted by these theologians and by many of the so-called philosophers that this moral sense this sense of duty of obligation was important and that conscience is an exotic
5764-299665-0033	We live together in families, tribes and nations.
5764-299665-0034	They are praised, admired and respected.
5764-299665-0035	They are regarded as good, that is to say, as moral.
5764-299665-0036	The members who add to the misery of the family, the tribe or the nation are considered bad members.
5764-299665-0037	The greatest of human beings had said, Conscience is born of love.
5764-299665-0038	As people advance, the remote consequences are perceived.
5764-299665-0039	The imagination is cultivated.
5764-299665-0040	A man puts himself in the place of another,
5764-299665-0041	The sense of duty becomes stronger, more imperative.
5764-299665-0042	Man judges himself.
5764-299665-0043	In all this, there is nothing supernatural.
5764-299665-0044	Man has deceived himself.
5764-299665-0045	Has Christianity done good?
5764-299665-0046	When the church had control, were men made better and happier?
5764-299665-0047	What has religion done for Hungary or Austria?
5764-299665-0048	Could these countries have been worse without religion?
5764-299665-0049	Could they have been worse had they had any other religion than Christianity?
5764-299665-0050	What did Christianity do for them?
5764-299665-0051	They hated pleasure.
5764-299665-0052	They muffled all the bells of gladness.
5764-299665-0053	The religion of the Puritan was an unadulterated curse.
5764-299665-0054	The Puritans believed the Bible to be the word of God, and this belief has always made those who held it cruel and wretched.
5764-299665-0055	Let me refer to just one fact showing the influence of a belief in the Bible on human beings.
5764-299665-0056	The Queen received the Bible, kissed it, and pledged herself to diligently read therein.
5764-299665-0057	In other words, it was just as fiendish, just as infamous as the Catholic spirit.
5764-299665-0058	Has the Bible made the people of Georgia kind and merciful?
5764-299665-0059	Religion has been tried and in all countries, in all times, it has failed.
5764-299665-0060	Religion has always been the enemy of science, of investigation and thought.
5764-299665-0061	Religion has never made men free.
5764-299665-0062	It has never made man moral, temperate, industrious and honest.
5764-299665-0063	Are Christians more temperate, nearer virtuous, nearer honest than savages?
5764-299665-0064	Can we cure disease by supplication
5764-299665-0065	Can we receive virtue or honor as alms?
5764-299665-0066	religion rests on the idea that nature has a master and that this master will listen to prayer that this master punishes and rewards that he loves praise and flattery and hates the brave and free
5764-299665-0067	We must have corn the stones
5764-299665-0068	The structure must have a basement.
5764-299665-0069	If we build, we must begin at the bottom.
5764-299665-0070	I have a theory and I have four cornerstones.
5764-299665-0071	The first stone is that matter, substance, cannot be destroyed, cannot be annihilated.
5764-299665-0072	if these corner-stones are facts it follows as a necessity that matter and force are from and to eternity that they can neither be increased nor diminished
5764-299665-0073	it follows that nothing has been or can be created that there never has been or can be a creator
5764-299665-0074	It followed that there could not have been any intelligence, any design back of matter and force.
5764-299665-0075	I say what I think.
5764-299665-0076	Every event has parents.
5764-299665-0077	That which hath not happened could not.
5764-299665-0078	In the infinite chain there is and there can be no broken, no missing link
5764-299665-0079	We now know that our first parents were not foreigners
5764-299665-0080	we now know if we know anything that the universe is natural and that men and women have been naturally produced
5764-299665-0081	We know the paths that life has travelled,
5764-299665-0082	We know the footsteps of advance. They have been traced.
5764-299665-0083	For thousands of years men and women have been trying to reform the world.
5764-299665-0084	Why have the reformers failed?
5764-299665-0085	They depend on the Lord, on luck and charity
5764-299665-0086	They live by fraud and violence and bequeath their vices to their children.
5764-299665-0087	Failure seems to be the trademark of nature. Why?
5764-299665-0088	nature produces without purpose sustains without intention and destroys without thought
5764-299665-0089	Must the world forever remain the victim of ignorant passion?
5764-299665-0090	Why should men and women have children that they cannot take care of? Children that are a burden and curses. Why?
5764-299665-0091	Passion is and always has been death.
5764-299665-0092	Law can punish, but it can neither reform criminals nor prevent crime.
5764-299665-0093	This cannot be done by talk or example.
5764-299665-0094	This is the solution of the whole question.
5764-299665-0095	This frees women
5764-299665-0096	Poverty and crime will be childless.
5764-299665-0097	it is far better to be free to leave the forts and barricades of fear to stand erect and face the future with a smile
6070-63485-0000	there dunfer said the schoolmaster in a low key to the chouette out with your vitriol and mind your eye
6070-63485-0001	The two monsters took off their shoes and moved stealthily along, keeping in the shadows of the houses.
6070-63485-0002	by means of this stratagem they followed so closely that although within a few steps of sarah and tom they did not hear them
6070-63485-0003	sarah and her brother having again passed by the tapis franc arrived close to the dilapidated house which was partly in ruins and its open cellars formed a kind of gulf along which the street ran in that direction
6070-63485-0004	in an instant the schoolmaster with a leap resembling in strength and agility the spring of a tiger seized seaton with one hand by the throat and exclaimed your money or i will fling you into this hole
6070-63485-0005	no said the old brute grumblingly no not one ring what a shame
6070-63485-0006	Tom Seaton did not lose his presence of mind during this scene, rapidly and unexpectedly as it had occurred.
6070-63485-0007	oo ah to lay a trap to catch us replied the thief
6070-63485-0008	Then, addressing Thomas Seaton, "'You know the plain of St. Denis?'
6070-63485-0009	did you see in the cabaret we had just left for i know you again the man whom the charcoal man came to seek
6070-63485-0010	cried the schoolmaster. A thousand francs and I'll kill him.
6070-63485-0011	"'Wretch, I do not seek his life,' replied Sarah to the schoolmaster.
6070-63485-0012	Let's go and meet him.
6070-63485-0013	Old boy, it will pay for looking after.
6070-63485-0014	well my wife shall be there said the schoolmaster you will tell her what you want and i shall see
6070-63485-0015	In the plain of Saint-Denis?
6070-63485-0016	"'Between St. Oint and the road of La Revolte, at the end of the road?' "'Agreed.'
6070-63485-0017	he had forgotten the address of the self-styled pan-painter
6070-63485-0018	The fiatca started.
6070-86744-0000	franz who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count in which terror was strangely mingled felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him
6070-86744-0001	my very good friend and excellent neighbour replied the count with a smile you really exaggerate my trifling exertions
6070-86744-0002	my father the comte de morcef although of spanish origin possesses considerable influence both at the court of france and madrid and i unhesitatingly place the best services of myself and all to whom my life is dear at your disposal
6070-86744-0003	I am scarcely credited.
6070-86744-0004	then it is settled said the count and i give you my solemn assurance that i only waited an opportunity like the present to realize plans that i have long meditated
6070-86744-0005	shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour inquired the count only let me warn you that i am proverbial for my punctilious exactitude in keeping my engagements day for day hour for hour said albert that will suit me to a dot
6070-86744-0006	so be it then replied the count and extending his hand towards a calendar suspended near the chimney-piece he said to-day is the twenty first of february and drawing out his watch added it is exactly half-past ten o'clock now promise me to remember this and expect me the twenty first of may at the same hour in the forenoon
6070-86744-0007	i reside in my father's house but occupy a pavilion at the farther side of the courtyard entirely separated from the main building
6070-86744-0008	now then said the count returning his tablets to his pocket make yourself perfectly easy the hand of your timepiece will not be more accurate in marking the time than myself
6070-86744-0009	that depends when do you leave
6070-86744-0010	"'For France? No, for Venice. I shall remain in Italy for another year or two.'
6070-86744-0011	"'Then we shall not meet in Paris.'
6070-86744-0012	I fear I shall not have that honour.
6070-86744-0013	well since we must part said the count holding out a hand to each of the young men allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant journey
6070-86744-0014	what is the matter asked albert of france when they had returned to their own apartments you seem more than commonly thoughtful
6070-86744-0015	i will confess to you albert replied franz the count is a very singular person and the appointment you have made to meet him in paris fills me with a thousand apprehensions
6070-86744-0016	Did you ever meet him previously to coming hither?'
6070-86744-0017	upon my honor. Then listen to me.
6070-86744-0018	he dwelt with considerable force and energy on the almost magical hospitality he had received from the count and the magnificence of his entertainment in the grotto of the thousand and one nights he recounted with circumstantial exactitude all the particulars of the supper the hashish the statues the dream
6070-86744-0019	then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the coliseum between the count and vampa in which the count had promised to obtain the release of the bandit peppino an engagement which as our readers are aware he most faithfully fulfilled
6070-86744-0020	But, said France, the Corsican bandits that were among the crew of his vessel
6070-86744-0021	Why, really, the thing seems to me simple enough.
6070-86744-0022	talking of countries replied france of what countries the count what is his native tongue whence does he derive his immense fortune and what were those events of his early life-a life as marvellous as unknown that have tinctured his succeeding years with so dark and gloomy a misanthropy
6070-86744-0023	Certainly these are questions that, in your place, I should like to have answered.
6070-86744-0024	my dear franz replied albert when upon receipt of my letter you found the necessity of asking the count's assistance you promptly went to him saying my friend albert de morcerf is in danger help me to deliver him
6070-86744-0025	What are his means of existence? What is his birthplace? Of what countries is he a native?
6070-86744-0026	i confess he asked me none no he merely came and freed me from the hands of signor vampa where i can assure you in spite of all my outward appearance of ease and unconcern i did not very particularly care to remain
6070-86744-0027	and this time it must be confessed that contrary to the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men the effective arguments were all on albert's side
6070-86744-0028	"'Well,' said France, with a sigh, "'do as you please, my dear Viscount, for your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation.'
6070-86744-0029	"'And now, my dear France, let us talk of something else.'
6070-86745-0000	then should anything appear to merit a more minute examination albert de marsuf could follow up his researches by means of a small gate similar to that close to the concierge's door and which merits a particular description
6070-86745-0001	shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows and hid from the garden and court these two apartments the only rooms into which as they were on the ground floor the prying eyes of the curious could penetrate
6070-86745-0002	at a quarter to ten a valet entered he composed with a little groom named john and who only spoke english all albert's establishment although the cook of the hotel was always at his service and on great occasions the count's chasseur also
6070-86745-0003	wait then during the day tell rosa that when i leave the opera i will sup with her as she wishes
6070-86745-0004	"'Very well, at half-past ten.'
6070-86745-0005	Is the countess up yet?
6070-86745-0006	The valet left the room.
6070-86745-0007	good morning lucien good morning said albert your punctuality really alarms me
6070-86745-0008	you whom i expected last you arrive at five minutes to ten when the time fixed was half-past
6070-86745-0009	No, no, my dear fellow, do not confound our plans.
6070-86745-0010	Yes, he has not much to complain of. Bourges is the capital of Charles VII.
6070-86745-0011	"'It is for that reason you see me so early.'
6070-86745-0012	i returned home at daybreak and strove to sleep but my head ached and i got up to have a ride for an hour
6070-86745-0013	pests i will do nothing of the kind the moment they come from government you would find them execrable
6070-86745-0014	besides that does not concern the home but the financial department
6070-86745-0015	About what? About the papers.
6070-86745-0016	in the entire political world of which you are one of the leaders,
6070-86745-0017	They say that it is quite fair, and that sowing so much red you ought to reap a little blue.
6070-86745-0018	come come that is not bad said lucien
6070-86745-0019	With your talents, you would make your fortune in three or four years.
6128-63240-0000	the gentleman had not even needed to sit down to become interested apparently he had taken up the volume from a table as soon as he came in and standing there after a single glance round the apartment had lost himself in its pages
6128-63240-0001	"'That has an unflattering sound for me,' said the young man.
6128-63240-0002	She is willing to risk that.
6128-63240-0003	"'Just as I am?' the visitor inquired, presenting himself with rather a workaday aspect.
6128-63240-0004	he was tall and lean and dressed throughout in black his shirt-collar was low and wide and the triangle of linen a little crumpled exhibited by the opening of his waistcoat was adorned by a pin containing a small red stone
6128-63240-0005	in spite of this decoration the young man looked poor as poor as a young man could look who had such a fine head and such magnificent eyes
6128-63240-0006	those of basil ransom were dark deep and glowing his head had a character of elevation which fairly added to his stature it was a head to be seen above the level of a crowd on some judicial bench or political platform or even on a bronze medal
6128-63240-0007	these things the eyes especially with their smouldering fire might have indicated that he was to be a great american statesman or on the other hand they might simply have proved that he came from carolina or alabama
6128-63240-0008	and yet the reader who likes a complete image who desires to read with the senses as well as with the reason is entreated not to forget that he prolonged his consonants and swallowed his vowels that he was guilty of allegiance and interpolations which were equally unexpected and that his discourse was pervaded by something sultry and vast something almost african in its rich basking tone
6128-63240-0009	And he took up his hat vaguely, a soft black hat with a low crown and an immense straight brim.
6128-63240-0010	well so it is they are all witches and wizards mediums and spirit-wrappers and roaring radicals
6128-63240-0011	If you are going to dine with her, you had better know it. Oh, murder!
6128-63240-0012	He looked at Mrs. Luna with intelligent incredulity.
6128-63240-0013	She was attractive and impertinent, especially the latter.
6128-63240-0014	Have you been in Europe?
6128-63240-0015	No, I haven't been anywhere.
6128-63240-0016	She hates it. She would like to abolish it.
6128-63240-0017	This last remark he made at a venture, for he had, naturally, not devoted any supposition whatever to Mrs. Luna,
6128-63240-0018	Are you very ambitious? You look as if you were.
6128-63240-0019	And Mrs. Luna added that now she was back, she didn't know what she should do.
6128-63240-0020	One didn't even know what one had come back for.
6128-63240-0021	Besides, Olive didn't want her in Boston and didn't go through the form of saying so.
6128-63240-0022	That was one comfort with Olive. She never went through any forms.
6128-63240-0023	she stood there looking consciously and rather seriously at mr ransom a smile of exceeding faintness played about her lips it was just perceptible enough to light up the native gravity of her face
6128-63240-0024	her voice was low and agreeable a cultivated voice and she extended a slender white hand to her visitor who remarked with some solemnity he felt a certain guilt of participation in mrs luna's indiscretion that he was intensely happy to make her acquaintance
6128-63240-0025	he observed that miss chancelew's hand was at once cold and limp she merely placed it in his without exerting the smallest pressure
6128-63240-0026	i shall be back very late we are going to a theatre party that's why we dine so early
6128-63240-0027	Mrs. Leunew's familiarity extended even to her sister. She remarked to Miss Chancellor that she looked as if she were got up for a sea voyage.
6128-63241-0000	poor ransom announced this fact to himself as if he had made a great discovery but in reality he had never been so boeotian as at that moment
6128-63241-0001	the women he had hitherto known had been mainly of his own soft clime and it was not often they exhibited the tendency he detected and cursorily deplored in mrs looney's sister
6128-63241-0002	Ransom was pleased with the vision of that remedy. It must be repeated that he was very provincial.
6128-63241-0003	He was sorry for her, but he saw in a flash that no one could help her. That was what made her tragic.
6128-63241-0004	she could not defend herself against a rich admiration a kind of tenderness of envy of any one who had been so happy as to have that opportunity
6128-63241-0005	his family was ruined they had lost their slaves their property their friends and relations their home had tasted of all the cruelty of defeat
6128-63241-0006	the state of mississippi seemed to him the state of despair so he surrendered the remnants of his patrimony to his mother and sisters and at nearly thirty years of age elided for the first time in new york in the costume of his province with fifty dollars in his pocket and a gnawing hunger in his heart
6128-63241-0007	it was in the female line as basil ransom had written in answering her letter with a good deal of form and flourish he spoke as if they had been royal houses
6128-63241-0008	if it had been possible to send mrs ransom money or even clothes she would have liked that but she had no means of ascertaining how such an offering would be taken
6128-63241-0009	Olive had a fear of everything, but her greatest fear was of being afraid.
6128-63241-0010	she had erected it into a sort of rule of conduct that whenever she saw a risk she was to take it and she had frequent humiliations at finding herself saved after all
6128-63241-0011	she was perfectly safe after writing to basil ransom and indeed it was difficult to see what he could have done to her except thank her-he was only exceptionally superlative for her letter and assure her that he would come and see her the first time his business he was beginning to get a little should take him to boston
6128-63241-0012	he was too simple too mississippian for that she was almost disappointed
6128-63241-0013	of all things in the world contention was most sweet to her though why it is hard to imagine for it always cost her tears headaches a day or two in bed acute emotion and it was very possible basil ransom would not care to contend
6128-63244-0000	Miss Chancellor herself has thought so much on the vital subject. Would not she make a few remarks and give them some of her experiences?
6128-63244-0001	"'How did the ladies on Beacon Street feel about the ballot?'
6128-63244-0002	perhaps they could speak for them more than for some others
6128-63244-0003	with her immense sympathy for reform she found herself so often wishing that reformers were a little different
6128-63244-0004	olive hated to hear that fine avenue talked about as if it were such a remarkable place and to live there were a proof of worldly glory
6128-63244-0005	all sorts of inferior people lived there and so brilliant a woman as mrs swarinder who lived at bruxbury ought not to mix things up
6128-63244-0006	she knew her place in the boston hierarchy and it was not what mrs farrinders supposed so that there was a want of perspective in talking to her as if she had been a representative of the aristocracy
6128-63244-0007	she wished to work in another field she had long been preoccupied with the romance of the people
6128-63244-0008	this might seem one of the most accessible of pleasures but in point of fact she had not found it so
6128-63244-0009	charlie was a young man in a white overcoat and a paper collar it was for him in the last analysis that they cared much the most
6128-63244-0010	Olive Chancellor wondered how Mrs. Finder would treat their branch of the question.
6128-63244-0011	If it be necessary, we are prepared to take certain steps to conciliate the shrinking.
6128-63244-0012	our movement is for all it appeals to the most delicate ladies
6128-63244-0013	Raise the standard among them and bring me your thousand names.
6128-63244-0014	and look after the details as well as the big currents mrs farrander added in a tone as explanatory as could be expected of such a woman and with a smile of which the sweetness was thrilling to her listener
6128-63244-0015	said olive chancellor with a face which seemed to plead for a remission of responsibility
6128-63244-0016	I want to be near to them, to help them.
6128-63244-0017	it was one thing to choose for herself but now the great representative of the enfranchisement of the sex from every form of bandage had chosen for her
6128-63244-0018	the unhappiness of women
6128-63244-0019	they were her sisters they were her own and the day of their delivery had dawned
6128-63244-0020	this was the only sacred cause this was the great the just revelation it must triumph it must sweep everything before it it must exact from the other the brutal blood-stained ravening race the last particle of expiation
6128-63244-0021	there would be names of women weak insulted persecuted but devoted in every pulse of their being to the cause and asking no better fate than to die for it
6128-63244-0022	it was not clear to this interesting girl in what manner such a sacrifice as this last would be required of her but she sold the matter through a kind of sunrise mist of emotion which made danger as rosy a success
6128-63244-0023	when miss bird's eye approached it transfigured her familiar her comical shape and made the poor little humanitary hack seem already a martyr
6128-63244-0024	olive chancellor looked at her with love remembered that she had never in her long and rewarded weary life had a thought or an impulse for herself
6128-63244-0025	she had been consumed by the passion of sympathy it had crumpled her into as many creases as an old glazed distended glove
6432-63722-0000	But excuse me, didn't you figure on doing some detecting and giving up fishing?
6432-63722-0001	and shag with the freedom of an old servant stood looking at his master as if not quite understanding the new twist the affairs had taken
6432-63722-0002	i'm going off fishing i may not catch anything and may not want to after i get there
6432-63722-0003	Get ready, Shag. Yes, sir, Colonel.
6432-63722-0004	and having put himself in a fair way as he'd hoped to solve some of the problems connected with the darcy case colonel ashley went down to police headquarters to learn more facts in connection with the murder of the east indian
6432-63722-0005	"'Pinkus and Donovan, haven't they, Carol?' "'Yep.'
6432-63722-0006	carroll was too much engaged in watching the blue smoke curl lazily upward from his cigar just then to say more
6432-63722-0007	Are you going to work on that case, Colonel?
6432-63722-0008	But he hadn't any more to do with it, Colonel, than that cat.
6432-63722-0009	Perhaps not, admitted Colonel Ashley.
6432-63722-0010	We've got our man and that's all we want.
6432-63722-0011	You're on the Darcy case, they tell me. In a way, yes.
6432-63722-0012	I'm working in the interest of the young man.
6432-63722-0013	It's just one of them coincidences like.
6432-63722-0014	"'busted his head in with a heavy candlestick, one of a pair.'
6432-63722-0015	"'Gad!' explained the colonel.
6432-63722-0016	"'the very pair I was going to buy.'
6432-63722-0017	Look here, Colonel. Do you know anything about this?
6432-63722-0018	and the detective's professional instincts got the upper hand of his friendliness not the least in the world not as much as you do was the cool answer
6432-63722-0019	i happened to see those candlesticks in the window of singafutt's shop the other day and i may have my mind to buy them when i had a chance
6432-63722-0020	Now, I'm afraid I won't. But how did it happen?
6432-63722-0021	thought i don't know whether that's his first or his last name anyhow he had a partner named shere
6432-63722-0022	anyhow he and phutt didn't get along very well it seems
6432-63722-0023	Neighbors often heard him scrapping a lot, and this afternoon they went at it again hot and heavy.
6432-63722-0024	Toward dark, a man went in to buy a lamp.
6432-63722-0025	he found the place without a light in it stumbled over something on the floor and there was ali's body with the head busted in and this heavy candlestick near it
6432-63722-0026	Sure. Held so tight we could hardly get it out.
6432-63722-0027	maybe the fight was about who owned the watch for the daggles talked in their foreign lingo and none of the neighbors could tell what they were saying i see
6432-63722-0028	And the watch, have you it? Yes, it's here.
6432-63722-0029	That's the watch, announced the headquarters detective, reaching in for it. Going in, see?
6432-63722-0030	You're not as squeamish as all that, are you? Just because it was in a dead man's hands and a woman's?
6432-63722-0031	and Donovan's voice was plainly sceptical.
6432-63722-0032	Yes, it may have some rough edges on it.
6432-63722-0033	and I've read enough about germs to know the danger. I'd advise you to be careful.
6432-63722-0034	"'If you don't mind, I should like to examine this a bit.'
6432-63722-0035	before the big wind in ireland suggested thong with a nod at his irish compatriot slightly laughed the colonel
6432-63722-0036	that's right agreed the colonel as he continued to move his magnifying glass over the surface of the still ticking watch
6432-63722-0037	and a close observer might have observed that he did not touch his bare fingers to the timepiece but poked it about and touched it here and there with the end of a lead pencil
6432-63722-0038	And Donovan, take a friend's advice and don't be too free with that watch."
6432-63722-0039	asked the surprised detective. Yes.
6432-63722-0040	Don't scratch yourself on it, whatever you do. Why not?
6432-63722-0041	simply because this watch
6432-63722-0042	Someone out here to see you.
6432-63722-0043	All right, be there in a second.
6432-63722-0044	Shingafut was the panting answer.
6432-63722-0045	i want to talk over darcy's case with you the colonel had said and the two had talked had thought had talked again and now were silent for a time
6432-63722-0046	What are the chances of getting him off legally, if we go at it from a negative standpoint? asked the colonel.
6432-63722-0047	Rather a hypothetical question, Colonel, but I should say it might be a fifty-fifty proposition.
6432-63722-0048	At best, he would get off with a scotch verdict of not proven, but he doesn't want that, nor do I.
6432-63722-0049	And you? I don't want it either.
6432-63722-0050	But I want to know just where we stand. Now I know.
6432-63722-0051	But I need to do a little more smoking out first. Now I want to think.
6432-63722-0052	If you'll excuse me, I'll pretend I'm fishing, and I may catch something.
6432-63722-0053	In fact, I have a feeling that I will land my fish.
6432-63722-0054	I'd recommend him to you instead of Blackstone. Thanks, laughed Kenneth.
6432-63722-0055	What is it? Perhaps I can help you.
6432-63722-0056	The old adage of two heads, you know.
6432-63722-0057	Yes, it still holds good.
6432-63722-0058	No alimony, replied the colonel, puzzled. Yes, just that.
6432-63722-0059	And there's no reason you shouldn't know.
6432-63723-0000	chuckled the colonel as he skilfully played the luckless trout now struggling to get loose from the hook
6432-63723-0001	and when the fish was landed panting on the grass and shag had been roused from his slumber to slip the now limp fish into the creel colonel ashley gave a sigh of relief and remarked i think i see it now
6432-63723-0002	"'The reason she asked no alimony?' inquired Kenneth.
6432-63723-0003	No, I wasn't thinking of that.
6432-63723-0004	however don't think i'm not interested in your case i've finished enough for to-day
6432-63723-0005	Well, I don't know that you can.
6432-63723-0006	It isn't generally known, went on the lawyer, that the hotel keeper's wife has left him.
6432-63723-0007	it was one of what at first might be called refined cruelty on her husband's part degenerating gradually into that of a baser sort
6432-63723-0008	You don't mean that Larch struck her, that there was physical abuse, do you?" asked the Colonel.
6432-63723-0009	the colonel did not disclose the fact that it was no news to him
6432-63723-0010	aaron grafton's statement was being unexpectedly confirmed
6432-63723-0011	He remembered that Cynthia and Grafton had once been in love with each other.
6432-63723-0012	She said he had struck her more than once, and she could stand it no longer.
6432-63723-0013	Because Larch made no defense.
6432-63723-0014	larch by refusing to appear practically admitted the charges against him and did not oppose the separation
6432-63723-0015	So I had to let her have her way, and we did not ask the court for money, though I had no such squeamish feelings when it came to my counsel fee.
6432-63723-0016	No, but he will. Or I'll sue him and get judgment. Oh, he'll pay all right.
6432-63723-0017	and it takes all sorts of persons to make it up.
6432-63723-0018	Still, I would like to know,
6432-63723-0019	the murder of mrs darcy had some time ago been shifted off the front page though it would get back there when the young jeweller was tried
6432-63723-0020	it had a double reputation so to speak
6432-63723-0021	grave and even reverent the conventions assembled in its ballroom and politicians of the upper if not better class were frequently seen in its dining-room or caf
6432-63723-0022	Larch himself was a peculiar character.
6432-63723-0023	in a smaller place he would have been called a saloon-keeper
6432-63723-0024	and it was this man rich it was said handsome certainly that cynthia ratchford had married
6432-63723-0025	To this was the answer, whispered, money.
6432-63723-0026	And, in a way, it was true.
6432-63723-0027	She also saw an opportunity of paying old debts and reaping some revenges.
6432-63723-0028	after the marriage which was a brilliant and gay one if not happy the large hotel it could hardly be called a home became the scene of many festive occasions
6432-63723-0029	then it was said of large that soon after the echoes of the wedding chimes had died away he had begun to treat his wife with refined cruelty that hidden away from the public underneath his habitual manner there was the rawness of the brute
6432-63723-0030	but it was noticed that the older and more conservative families were less often represented and when they were it was by some of the younger members whose reputations were already smirched or who had not yet acquired any and were willing to take a chance
6432-63723-0031	it wouldn't do you know after that story came out for me and the vice-chancellor who sat in the case as well as other judges and members of the bar to be seen there kenneth explained to the colonel
6432-63723-0032	meanwhile colonel ashleigh was a very busy man and to no one did he tell very much about his activities he saw darcy frequently at the jail and to that young man's pleadings that something be done always returned the answer
6432-63723-0033	Don't worry, it will come out all right.
6432-63723-0034	I'm going to rectify them, but it will take time.
6432-63723-0035	It's hard for Miss Mason, too, although she's bearing up like a major.
6432-63723-0036	So King got bail. Who put it up?
6432-63723-0037	It was high. Large.
6432-63723-0038	They took Harry away a while ago.
6432-63723-0039	but his are pretty uncertain shoes to be in just the same.
6432-63723-0040	Only that I... Darcy hesitated and grew red.
6432-63723-0041	good evening colonel he called genially will you join me in a welsh rabbit
6432-63723-0042	Thank you. No.
6432-63723-0043	I'm afraid my digestion isn't quite up to that, as I've had to cut out my fishing of late.
6432-63723-0044	Now, as to certain matters in the store on the morning of the murder,
6432-63723-0045	The stopped clocks, for instance. Have you any theory?
6432-63723-0046	there were three of them the centre figure being that of harry king and he was very much intoxicated
6432-63723-0047	That is not always, but sometimes it happened to be so now.
6432-63723-0048	i beg your pardon he said in the cultured tones he knew so well how to use yet of which he made so little use of late
6432-63723-0049	I said, where have you been? remarked the other. We've missed you.
6432-63723-0050	i said i was golfing he went on exceedingly distinctly though with an effort
6432-63723-0051	Why Polonia, some would ask.
6432-63723-0052	because dear friend replied king softly he somewhat resembles a certain person here who talks too much but who is not so wise as he thinks
6432-63723-0053	there was a rattle of coins on the mahogany bar as king sought to disentangle a single bill from the wadded-up currency in his pocket
6432-63723-0054	it's it's an odd coin an old roman one that mrs darcy had in her private collection kept in the jewelry store safe was the whispered answer
6432-63723-0055	i went over them the other day and noticed some were missing though i saw them all when i paid a visit to her just a short time before she was killed
6432-63723-0056	"'That was hers,' went on the jeweler.
6432-63723-0057	Now Harry King has it, exclaimed Colonel Ashley.
6938-70848-0000	Even the sun came out pale and watery at noon.
6938-70848-0001	The colds and rheumatism of the rainy months vanished.
6938-70848-0002	Asked a worker, last Sunday you did it when the young girls...
6938-70848-0003	Well, didn't they shoot us? One man exhibited his arm in a sling.
6938-70848-0004	Haven't I got something to remember them by the devils?
6938-70848-0005	Who are you to destroy the legal government? Who is Lenin? A German?
6938-70848-0006	Who are you? A counter-revolutionist? A provocateur? They beloved at him.
6938-70848-0007	You call yourselves the people of Russia, but you are not the people of Russia.
6938-70848-0008	The peasants are the people of Russia. Wait until the peasants...
6938-70848-0009	We know what the peasants will say. Aren't they working men like ourselves?
6938-70848-0010	This man especially welcomed the call to a congress of peasants.
6938-70848-0011	This last were the young generation who had been serving in the army.
6938-70848-0012	whereupon the old executive committee left the hall
6938-70848-0013	Down with him, they shrieked.
6938-70848-0014	Fearful Tamil cries down with the Bolsheviki.
6938-70848-0015	upon my return i visited smolny no such accusation was made against me there after a brief conversation i left and that's all let anyone present make such an accusation
6938-70848-0016	Meanwhile, the question of the status of the executive committee was agitating all minds.
6938-70848-0017	By declaring the assembly extraordinary conference, it had been planned to block the re-election of the executive committee.
6938-70848-0018	but this worked both ways the last socialist revolutionists decided that if the congress had no power over the executive committee then the executive committee had no power over the congress
6938-70848-0019	on the twenty seventh occurred the debate on the land question which revealed the differences between the agrarian program of the bolsheviki and the left socialist revolutionaries
6938-70848-0020	The Constituent Assembly will not dare to break with the will of the people
6938-70848-0021	Followed him Lenin. Listen to now with absorbing intensity.
6938-70848-0022	the first stage was the crushing of autocracy and the crushing of the power of the industrial capitalists and the landowners whose interests are closely related
6938-70848-0023	The Dumas and Zam Stoves were dropped
6938-70848-0024	He knew that an agreement with the Bolsheviki was being discussed, but he did not know that it had been concluded.
6938-70848-0025	He spoke to the Rome Convention.
6938-70848-0026	The villages will save us in the end.
6938-70848-0027	But the present moment is international and that is why it is invincible.
6938-70848-0028	The will of millions of workers is now concentrated in the hall.
6938-70848-0029	A new humanity will be born of this war.
6938-70848-0030	I greet you with the Christianing of a new Russian life and freedom.
7018-75788-0000	then i took up a great stone from among the trees and coming up to him smote him therewith on the head with all my might and crushed in his skull as he lay dead drunk
7018-75788-0001	Behold, a ship was making for the island, through the dashing sea and clashing waves.
7018-75788-0002	Hearing this, I was sore troubled remembering what I had before suffered from the ape kind.
7018-75788-0003	Upon this he bought me a cotton bag, and giving it to me, said, Take this bag and fill it with pebbles from the beach, and go forth with the company of the townsfolk, to whom I will give a charge respecting thee.
7018-75788-0004	Do as they do, and be like thou shalt gain what may further thy return voyage to thy native land.
7018-75788-0005	then he carried me to the beach where i filled my bag with pebbles large and small and presently we saw a company of folk issue from the town each bearing a bag like mine filled with pebbles
7018-75788-0006	to these he committed me commending me to their care and saying this man is a stranger so take him with you and teach him how to gather that he may get his daily bread and you will earn your reward and recompense in heaven
7018-75788-0007	now sleeping under these trees were many apes which when they saw us rose and fled from us and swarmed up among the branches whereupon my companions began to pelt them with what they had in their bags and the apes fell to plucking of the fruit of the trees and casting them at the folk
7018-75788-0008	We weighed anchor, and Sharazad perceived the dawn of the day and ceased to say in her permitted say.
7018-75788-0009	When it was the 559th night,
7018-75788-0010	and ceased not sailing till we arrived safely at busara.
7018-75788-0011	there i abode a little and then went on to baghdad where i entered my quarter and found my house and forgathered with my family and saluted my friends who gave me joy of my safe return and i laid up all my goods and valuables in my storehouses
7018-75788-0012	After which I returned to my old merry way of life and forgot all I had suffered in the great profit and gain I had made.
7018-75788-0013	next morning as soon as it was light he prayed the dawn prayer and after blessing mohammed the cream of all creatures betook himself to the house of sindbad the seaman and wished him a good day
7018-75788-0014	here i found a great ship ready for sea and full of merchants and notables who had with them goods of price so i embarked my bales therein
7018-75788-0015	Happily amongst you is one righteous, whose prayers the Lord will accept.
7018-75788-0016	Presently the ship struck the mountain and broke up, and all and everything on board of her were plunged into the sea.
7018-75788-0017	but it burneth in their bellies so they cast it up again and it congealeth on the surface of the water whereby its colour and quantities are changed and at last the waves cast it ashore and the travellers and merchants who know it collect it and sell it
7018-75788-0018	each that died we washed and shrouded in some of the clothes and linen cast ashore by the tides and after little the rest of my fellows perished one by one till i had buried the last of the party and abode alone on the island with but a little provision left i who was wont to have so much
7018-75788-0019	But there is majesty, and there is no might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great.
7018-75789-0000	When it was the 561st night,
7018-75789-0001	Then, sighing for myself, I set to work collecting a number of pieces of Chinese and Cormoran aloes wood, and I bound them together with ropes from the wreckage. Then I chose out from the broken-up ship straight planks of even size and fixed them firmly upon the aloes wood, making me a boat raft a little narrower than the channel of the stream, and I tied it tightly and firmly as though it were nailed.
7018-75789-0002	land after land shalt thou see confined but no other life on thy wish shall wait fret not thy soul and thy thoughts o night all woes shall end or sooner or late
7018-75789-0003	I rowed my conveyance into the place, which was intensely dark, and the current carried the raft with it down the underground channel.
7018-75789-0004	and i threw myself down upon my face on the raft by reason of the narrowness of the channel whilst the stream ceased not to carry me along knowing not night from day for the excess of the gloom which encompassed me about and my terror and concern for myself lest i should perish
7018-75789-0005	when i awoke at last i found myself in the light of heaven and opening my eyes i saw myself in a broad stream and the raft moored to an island in the midst of a number of indians and abyssinians
7018-75789-0006	But I was delighted at my escape from the river.
7018-75789-0007	When they saw I understood them not and made them no answer, one of them came forward and said to me in Arabic, Peace be with thee, O my brother.
7018-75789-0008	o my brother answered he we are husbandmen and tillers of the soil who came out to water our fields and plantations and finding thee asleep on this raft laid hold of it and made it fast by us against thou shouldest awake at thy leisure
7018-75789-0009	I answered, For Allah's sake, O my lord, ere I speak give me somewhat to eat, for I am starving, and after ask me what thou wilt.
7018-75789-0010	When it was the 562nd night,
7018-75789-0011	She said it hath reached me, O auspicious king, that Sinbad the seaman continued. When I landed and found myself amongst the Indians and Abyssinians, and had taken some rest, they consulted among themselves and said to one another, There is no help for it, but we carry him with us and present him to our king, that he may acquaint him with his adventures.
7018-75789-0012	So I consorted with the chief of the islanders, and they paid me the utmost respect.
7018-75789-0013	so i rose without stay or delay and kissed the king's hand and acquainted him with my longing to set out with the merchants for that i pined after my people and mine own land
7018-75789-0014	quoth he thou art thine own master yet if it be thy will to abide with us on our head and eyes be it for thou gladdenest us with thy company
7018-75789-0015	by allah o my lord answered i thou hast indeed overwhelmed me with thy favours and well-doings but i weary for a sight of my friends and family and native country
7018-75789-0016	Then I took leave of him and of all my intimates and acquaintances in the island, and embarked with the merchants aforesaid.
7018-75789-0017	he asked me whence they came and i said to him by allah o commander of the faithful i know not the name of the city nor the way thither

7018-75789-0019	His letter hath shown me this, and as for the mightiness of his dominion, thou hast told us what thou hast eyewitnessed.
7018-75789-0020	presently my friends came to me and i distributed presents among my family and gave alms and largess after which i yielded myself to joyance and enjoyment mirth and merrymaking and forgot all that i had suffered
7018-75789-0021	such then o my brothers is the history of what befell me in my sixth voyage and to-morrow inshallah
7018-75789-0022	I will tell you the story of my seventh and last voyage, which is still more wondrous and marvellous than that of the first six.
7018-75789-0023	When it was the 563rd night,
7018-75789-0024	she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when sindbad the seaman had related the history of what befell him in his sixth voyage and all the company had dispersed sindbad the landsman went home and slept as of wont
7018-75789-0025	The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad the Seaman
7018-75789-0026	Know, O company, that after my return from my sixth voyage, which brought me abundant profit, I resumed my former life in all possible joyance and enjoyment and mirth and making merry day and night, and I tarried some time in this solace and satisfaction, till my soul began once more to long to sail the seas and see foreign countries and company with merchants and hear new things.
7018-75789-0027	so having made up my mind i packed up in bales a quantity of precious stuffs suited for sea trade and repaired with them from bagdad city to bassorah town where i found a ship ready for sea and in her a company of considerable merchants
7018-75789-0028	but the captain arose and tightening his girdle tucked up his skirts and after taking refuge with allah from satan the stoned climbed to the mast-head whence he looked out right and left and gazing at the passengers and crew failed to buffet in his face and pluck out his beard
7018-75789-0029	This he set in a saucer wetted with a little water, and after waiting a short time, smelt and tasted it. And then he took out of the chest a booklet, wherein he read a while, and said, weeping, Know, O ye passengers, that in this book is a marvellous matter, denoting that whoso come thither shall surely die, without hope of escape, for that this ocean is called the sea of the clime of the king, wherein is a sepulchre of our Lord's son,
7018-75789-0030	A second fish made its appearance, and which we had seen nought more monstrous.
7018-75789-0031	when suddenly a violent squall of wind arose and smote the ship which rose out of the water and settled upon a great reef the haunt of sea-monsters where it broke up and fell asunder into planks and all and everything on board were plunged into the sea
7105-2330-0000	Unfortunately, there could be no doubt or misconception as to Platterbaff's guilt.
7105-2330-0001	he had not only pleaded guilty but had expressed his intention of repeating his escapade in other directions as soon as circumstances permitted throughout the trial he was busy examining a small model of the free trade hall in manchester
7105-2330-0002	the jury could not possibly find that the prisoner had not deliberately and intentionally blown up the albert hall the question was could they find any extenuating circumstances which should permit of an acquittal
7105-2330-0003	of course any sentence which the law might feel compelled to inflict would be followed by an immediate pardon but it was highly desirable from the government's point of view that the necessity for such an exercise of clemency should not arise
7105-2330-0004	a headlong pardon on the eve of a by-election with threats of a heavy voting defection if it were withheld or even delayed would not necessarily be a surrender but it would look like one
7105-2330-0005	hence the anxiety in the crowded court and in the little groups gathered round the tape machines in whitehall and donning street and other affected centres
7105-2330-0006	the jury returned from considering their verdict there was a flutter an excited murmur a death-like hush
7105-2330-0007	The foreman delivered his message.
7105-2330-0008	The jury find the prisoner guilty of blowing up the Albert Hall.
7105-2330-0009	The jury wished to add a writer, drawing attention to the fact that a by-election is pending in the parliamentary division of Nemesis on hand.
7105-2330-0010	And may the Lord have mercy on the pole, a junior consul exclaimed irreverently.
7105-2330-0011	Fifteen hundred? said the Prime Minister with a shudder. It's too horrible to think of.
7105-2330-0012	Our majority last time was only a thousand and seven.
7105-2330-0013	7.30, amended the Prime Minister. We must avoid any appearance of precipitancy.
7105-2330-0014	not later than seven thirty then said the chief organizer i have promised the agent down there that he shall be able to display posters announcing platter baff is out before the poll opens
7105-2330-0015	He said it was our only chance of getting a telegram. Red Rep is in tonight.
7105-2330-0016	despite the earliness of the hour a small crowd had gathered in the street outside and the horrible menacing three-long refrain of the fifteen hundred voting men came in a steady monotonous chant
7105-2330-0017	He exclaimed, Won't go.
7105-2330-0018	He says he never has left prison without a breastband to play him out and he's not going to go without one now.
7105-2330-0019	said the prime minister we can hardly be supposed to supply a released prisoner with a brass band how on earth could we defend it on the estimates
7105-2330-0020	Anyway, he won't go unless he has a band.
7105-2330-0021	Paul opens in 5 minutes.
7105-2330-0022	Is Splatterbuff out yet?
7105-2330-0023	In heaven's name, why?
7105-2330-0024	The chief organizer rang off.
7105-2330-0025	This is not a moment for standing on dignity, he observed bluntly. Musicians must be supplied at once.
7105-2330-0026	Can't you get a strike permit? asked the organizer.
7105-2330-0027	I'll try, said the home secretary and went to the telephone.
7105-2330-0028	Eight o'clock struck. The crowd outside chanted with an increasing volume of sound. We'll vote the other way.
7105-2330-0029	A telegram was brought in.
7105-2330-0030	It was from the Central Committee Rooms at Nemesis.
7105-2330-0031	Without a band, he would not go. And they had no band.
7105-2330-0032	a quarter past ten half past
7105-2330-0033	Have you any band instruments of an easy nature to play?
7105-2330-0034	demanded the chief organizer of the prison governor drums cymbals those sort of things
7105-2330-0035	the warders have a private band of their own said the governor but of course i couldn't allow the men themselves
7105-2330-0036	Lend us the instruments, said the chief organizer.
7105-2330-0037	the popular song of the moment replied the agitator after a moment's reflection
7105-2330-0038	it was a tune they had all heard hundreds of times so there was no difficulty in turning out a passable imitation of it to the improvised strains of i don't want to do it the prisoners strode forth to freedom
7105-2330-0039	the word of the sang had reference it was understood to the incarcerating government and not to the destroyer of the albert hall
7105-2330-0040	This seat was lost, after all, by a narrow majority.
7105-2330-0041	the local trade unionists took offence at the fact of cabinet ministers having personally acted as strike-breakers and even the release of platterbaugh failed to pacify them
7105-2340-0000	with that notorious failing of his he was not the sort of person one wanted in one's house
7105-2340-0001	well the failing still exists doesn't it said the husband or do you suppose a reform of character is entailed along with the estate
7105-2340-0002	Besides, cynicism apart, his being rich will make a difference in the way people will look at his failing.
7105-2340-0003	when a man is absolutely wealthy not merely well-to-do all suspicion of sordid motive naturally disappears the thing becomes merely a tiresome malady

7105-2340-0005	A Wilfred pigeon-coat had covered himself with honours in the course of Marlborough's campaigns, and the name Wilfred had been a baptismal weakness in the family ever since. The new heir to the family dignity and estates was a young man of about five-and-twenty who was known more by reputation than by person to a wide circle of cousins and kinsfolk.
7105-2340-0006	and the reputation was an unpleasant one.
7105-2340-0007	from his late school days onward he had been possessed by an acute and obstinate form of kleptomania he had the acquisitive instinct of the collector without any of the collector's discrimination

7105-2340-0009	Signed, Wilfred Pigeon Coat
7105-2340-0010	I suppose he's bringing us a present for the silver wedding? Good gracious!
7105-2340-0011	The talk flitted nervously and hurriedly from one impersonal topic to another.
7105-2340-0012	In the drawing room after dinner, their nervousness and awkwardness increased.
7105-2340-0013	oh we haven't shown you the silver wedding presents said mrs peter suddenly as though struck by a brilliant idea for entertaining the guest here they all are
7105-2340-0014	Such nice useful gifts. A few duplicates of course.
7105-2340-0015	Seven cream jugs? Put in Peter.
7105-2340-0016	We feel that we must live on cream for the rest of our lives.
7105-2340-0017	Of course, some of them can be changed.
7105-2340-0018	I put it down by the claret jug, said Wilfred, busy with another object.
7105-2340-0019	Vigilance was not completely crowned with a sense of victory.
7105-2340-0020	after they had said good-night to their visitor mrs peter expressed her conviction that he had taken something
7105-2340-0021	how on earth are we to know said peter the mean pig hasn't brought us a present and i'm hanged if he shall carry one off
7105-2340-0022	is the only thing to do.
7105-2340-0023	Wilfred was late in coming down to breakfast, and his manner showed plainly that something was amiss.
7105-2340-0024	it's an unpleasant thing to have to say he blurted out presently but i'm afraid you must have a thief among your servants something's been taken out of my portmanteau
7105-2340-0025	it was a little present from my mother and myself for your silver wedding
7105-2340-0026	i should have given it to you last night after dinner only it happened to be a crane jug and you seemed annoyed at having so many duplicates so i felt rather awkward about giving you another

7105-2340-0029	Husband and wife looked blankly and desperately at one another.
7105-2340-0030	it was mrs peter who arrived first at an inspiration how dreadful to think there are thieves in the house we keep the drawing-room locked up at night of course but anything might be carried off while we are at breakfast
7105-2340-0031	she rose and went out hurriedly as though to assure herself that the drawing-room was not being stripped of its silverware and returned a moment later bearing a cream jug in her hands
7105-2340-0032	the pigeon-coats had turned paler than ever mrs peter had a final inspiration
7105-2340-0033	peter dashed out of the room with glad relief he had lived so long during the last few minutes that a golden wedding seemed within measurable distance
7105-2340-0034	Mrs. Peter turned to her guest with confidential coyness.
7105-2340-0035	Peter's little weakness, it runs in the family. Good Lord!
7105-2340-0036	Do you mean to say he's a kleptomaniac? Like Cousin Snatcher?
7105-2340-0037	brave little woman said peter with a gasp of relief i could never have done it
7902-96591-0000	I'm from the Cutter, lying off the coast.
7902-96591-0001	"'Don't cry,' he said. "'I was obliged to come.'
7902-96591-0002	And—and you have not found out anything?" came in quick, frightened tones.
7902-96591-0003	I wish you would believe me that I am in as great trouble about it as you are.
7902-96591-0004	that my father sir risdon graham has smuggled goods here
7902-96591-0005	He could not help it. He hates the smugglers. You shall not tell.
7902-96591-0006	Pray, pray, say you will not. Archie was silent.
7902-96591-0007	then as archie stood in the dark literally aghast with astonishment he heard the faint rustling once more and again all was silent
7902-96591-0008	he laughed but it was a curious kind of laugh full of vexation injured amour propre as the french call our love of our own dignity of which archibald raystroke in the full flush of his young belief in his importance as a british officer had a pretty good stock
7902-96591-0009	It all comes of dressing up in this stupid way, like a rough-fisher lad.
7902-96591-0010	Cold Water came on this idea directly, as he recalled the fact that the darkness was intense and Celia could not have seen him.
7902-96591-0011	I'll soon show them that I am not going to be played with.
7902-96591-0012	For it suddenly occurred to him that he was not only a prisoner, but a prisoner in the power of a very reckless set of people who would stop at nothing.
7902-96591-0013	No, he thought to himself. I don't believe they would kill me, but they would knock me about.
7902-96591-0014	the kick he had received was a foretaste of what he might expect and after a little consideration he came to the conclusion that his duty was to escape and get back to the cutter as quickly as he could
7902-96591-0015	to do this he must scheme lie hid till morning then make for the nearest point and signal for help unless a boat's crew were already searching for him how to escape
7902-96591-0016	The window was barred, but he went to it and tried the bars one by one to find them all solidly fitted into the stone sill.
7902-96591-0017	next moment as he felt his way about his hand touched an old-fashioned marble mantelpiece fireplace chimney
7902-96591-0018	Yes, if other ways failed he could escape up the chimney.
7902-96591-0019	No, that was too bad. He cannot do that.
7902-96591-0020	sympathy and pity for the dwellers in the hose were completely gone now and he set his teeth fast and mentally called himself a weak idiot for ever thinking about such people
7902-96591-0021	A narrow table against the wall in two places.
7902-96591-0022	He went and tried to force his head through, recalling as he did that where a person's head would go the rest of the body would pass.
7902-96591-0023	But there was no chance for his body there, and the head would not go first.
7902-96591-0024	"'A fellow who was shut up in prison for life might do it,' he said, "'but not in a case like this.'
7902-96592-0000	Sure you've looked round everywhere, boy? Yes, father, quite.
7902-96592-0001	I'm going home to breakfast.
7902-96592-0002	Shall I come too, Father? No.
7902-96592-0003	stop here till sir risdon comes down and tell him i'm very sorry that we should have cleared out last night only a born fool saw jerry nandy's lobster boat coming into the cove and came running to say it was a party from the cutter yes father
7902-96592-0004	"'Tell him not to be uneasy. "'Tis all right, and I'll have everything clear away to-night.'
7902-96592-0005	the dull sound of departing steps and a low whistling sound coming down through the skylight window into the cabin where archie raystroke lay with his heavy eyelids pressed down by sleep
7902-96592-0006	What a queer dream, he thought to himself.
7902-96592-0007	But how queer for Mr. Gur to be talking like that to Andrew Teal, the boy who helped the cook.
7902-96592-0008	"'And why did Andy call Mr. Gurr father?'
7902-96592-0009	There was an interval of thinking over this knotty question during which the low whistling went on.
7902-96592-0010	And I'm hungry too. Time always up, I suppose.
7902-96592-0011	no he was not dreaming for he was looking out on the sea over which a faint mist hung like wreaths of smoke
7902-96592-0012	what did they say false alarm tell sir risdon they would clear all away to-night see if anything had been left about lobster boat
7902-96592-0013	Once out of that room he could ran, And by daylight the smugglers dare not hunt him down.
7902-96592-0014	oh those bars he mentally exclaimed and he was advancing towards them when just as he drew near there was a rustling noise under the window a couple of hands seized the bars there was a scratching of boot-toes against stonework and ram's face appeared to gaze into the room by intention but into the astonished countenance of the young midshipman instead
7902-96592-0015	Wren was the first to recover from his surprise.
7902-96592-0016	Hello, he said. Who are you?
7902-96592-0017	"'Go round and open the door. I was shut in last night by mistake.'
7902-96592-0018	"'I saw you last night and wondered whose boy he was.'
7902-96592-0019	It was you father kicked for shirking, and my, well, I hardly knowed you.
7902-96592-0020	Nonsense.
7902-96592-0021	"'Won't do,' said Rem, grinning.
7902-96592-0022	Think I don't know you, Mr. Orfizer?
7902-96592-0023	"'Won't do,' said Rem quickly. "'I know you.'
7902-96592-0024	Been playing the spy. That's what you've been doing. Who locked you in?
7902-96592-0025	Archie stepped back to the door, listening, but there was not a sound.
7902-96592-0026	He has gone to give the alarm, thought the prisoner, and he looked excitedly round for a way of escape.
7902-96592-0027	Nothing but the chimney presented itself.
7902-96592-0028	a happy inspiration had come and placing one hand upon his chest he thrust in the other gave a tug and drew out his little curved dirk glanced at the edge ran to the window and began to cut at one of the bars labour in vain
7902-96592-0029	He divided the paint and produced a few squeaks and grating sounds as he realized that the attempt was madness.
7902-96592-0030	the result was not very satisfactory but sufficiently so to make him essay the bar of the window once more producing a grating ear-selling sound as he found that now he did make a little impression so little though that the probability was if he kept on working well for twenty-four hours he would not get through
7902-96592-0031	But at the end of five minutes he stopped and thrust back the dirk into its sheath.
7902-96592-0032	No, I can't part with that. Ha ha ha, laughed the boy jeeringly.
7902-96592-0033	But I'll... Yes, I'll give you a guinea if you will let me out.
7902-96592-0034	"'Guinea?' said the boy. "'Think I'll do it for her guinea?' "'Well, then, too.'
7902-96592-0035	"'Be quick, there's a good fellow. I want to get away at once.'
7902-96592-0036	Not you. Only a sham.
7902-96592-0037	Why, your clothes don't fit you and your cap's put on all skiru.
7902-96592-0038	"'Never mind about that. Let me out of this place.'
7902-96592-0039	i told you a fisher boy cried archie impatiently but trying not to offend his visitor who possessed the power of conferring freedom by speaking sharply
7902-96592-0040	not you look like a wild beast in a cage like a monkey you insolent
7902-96592-0041	Archie checked himself, and the boy laughed.
7902-96592-0042	It was your turn yesterday. It's mine today. What a game.
7902-96592-0043	"'You laughed and fleered at me when I was on the cutter's deck.'
7902-96592-0044	I say, you do look like a rummin', just like a big monkey in a show.
7902-96592-0045	Ram showed his white teeth as he burst out with a long, low fit of laughter.
7902-96592-0046	"'You ropesend me,' he said.
7902-96592-0047	Why, I could tie you up in a knot and heave you off the cliff any day. What a game.
7902-96592-0048	bit of a middy fed on a salt tack and weevilly biscuit talk of giving me robesund
7902-96592-0049	Once more, will you come and let me out? No.
7902-96592-0050	to his astonishment the boy did not flinch but thrust his own arms through placing them about the middy's waist clenching his hand behind and uttering a sharp whistle
7902-96594-0000	Seemed any good spears last night, Mr. Gurr, eh?
7902-96594-0001	"'Yes, sir, but he may turn up on the cliff at any moment.'
7902-96594-0002	Yes. Men quite ready? Yes, sir.
7902-96594-0003	That's right, of course. Well armed.
7902-96594-0004	Soon as the signal comes, we shall push off.
7902-96594-0005	Awkward bit of country, sir. Six miles row before you can find a place to land.
7902-96594-0006	So shall we, yes, sir.
7902-96594-0007	You don't think, Mr. Gurr, that they would dare to injure him if he was so unlucky as to be caught?'
7902-96594-0008	"'Well, sir,' said the master, hesitating. "'Smugglers are smugglers.'
7902-96594-0009	"'Certainly, sir. Smugglers are smugglers indeed.'
7902-96594-0010	"'Beg pardon, sir. Didn't mean any harm.'
7902-96594-0011	I'm getting very anxious about Mr. Raystroke. Start at once, sir.
7902-96594-0012	No, wait another half hour.
7902-96594-0013	Very ill-advised thing to do.
7902-96594-0014	Then I must request that you will not make it again. Very true.
7902-96594-0015	awkward mr gerrard awkward
7902-96594-0016	"'Yes, sir, of course.'
7902-96594-0017	Say awkward in the future, not awkward.
7902-96594-0018	"'I mean all alone by myself, sir.'
7902-96594-0019	"'What for? There aren't a public house for ten miles. Didn't mean that.'
7902-96594-0020	Then what did you mean? Speak out, and don't do the double shuffle all over my clean deck. No, sir.
7902-96594-0021	hopping about like a cat on hot bricks.
7902-96594-0022	"'Now then, why do you want to go ashore?'
7902-96594-0023	beg pardon didn't mean it out sir said the sailor touching his forelock
7902-96594-0024	yes sir said the man humbly shall i go at once sir
7902-96594-0025	No, wait.
7902-96594-0026	Keep a sharp lookout on the cliff to see if Mr. Raystroke is making signals for a boat.
7902-96594-0027	he swung round walked aft and began sweeping the shore again with his glass while the master and dick exchanged glances which meant a great deal
7902-96594-0028	At last the little lieutenant could bear the anxiety no longer.
7902-96594-0029	pipe away the men to that boat there he said and as the crew sprang in
7902-96594-0030	"'Now, Mr. Gurr,' he said, "'I'm only going to say one thing to you in the way of instructions.' "'Yes, sir?'
7902-96594-0031	"'Beg pardon, sir,' said the master, deprecatingly.
7902-96594-0032	steady my lads steady cried the master keep stroke and then he began to make plans as to his first proceedings on getting ashore
7902-96595-0000	"'Say, Mr. Girk,' said Dick, after one of these searches, "'he wouldn't run away.' "'What?'
7902-96595-0001	Mr. Raystoke, sir? Don't be a fool.
7902-96595-0002	What? Check them off yonder.
7902-96595-0003	gerd glanced round to see if the men were looking and then said rather huskily but kindly
7902-96595-0004	Ah, ejaculated Dick sadly.
7902-96595-0005	"'Say, Mr. Gerser, which thankful I am for you for speaking so, but you don't really think as he has come to harm?'
7902-96595-0006	"'I hope not, Dick. I hope not. But smugglers don't stand at anything sometimes.'
7902-96595-0007	I do assure you there's nothing here but what you may see.
7902-96595-0008	If you'd let me finish, you'd know, said Gerg roughly. One of our boys is missing. Seen him up here?
7902-96595-0009	Boy, about seventeen with a red cap? No, sir, indeed I've not.
7902-96595-0010	don't know as he has been seen about here do you said garrow looking at her searchingly no sir
7902-96595-0011	If she knew evil had come to the poor lad, her face would tell tales like print.
7902-96595-0012	i said a lad about seventeen in a red cap like yours said gur very shortly
7902-96595-0013	The man shook his head and stared as if he didn't half understand the drift of what was said.
7902-96595-0014	here my lad where's your master
7902-96595-0015	Eh? I say, where's your master?
7902-96595-0016	gur returned away impatiently again and signing to his men to follow they all began to tramp up the steep track leading toward the hose with the rabbits scuttling away among the furze and showing their white cottony tails for a moment as they darted down into their holes
7902-96595-0017	i dunno muttered dick and i men can't be sure
7902-96595-0018	gur saluted and stated his business while the baronet who had turned saluer and more careworn than his lot drew a breath full of relief one of your shipboys he said
7902-96595-0019	A lad looking like a common sailor and wearing a red cap. No, said Sir Risdon.
7902-96595-0020	I have seen no one answering to the description here.
7902-96595-0021	beg pardon sir but can you as a gentleman assure me that he is not here certainly said sir risdon
7902-96595-0022	"'Surely,' cried Sir Rizdan excitedly.
7902-96595-0023	Serviton was silent.
7902-96595-0024	Lady Grimm looked ghastly.
7902-96595-0025	You do not know? No.
7975-280057-0000	These hatreds were soon to make trouble for me, of which I had never dreamed.
7975-280057-0001	henry washington younger my father represented jackson county three times in the legislature and was also a judge of the county court
7975-280057-0002	my mother who was beersheba fristoe of independence was the daughter of richard fristoe who fought under general andrew jackson at new orleans jackson county having been so named at my grandfather fristoe's insistence
7975-280057-0003	I cannot remember when I did not know how to shoot.
7975-280057-0004	My brother James was born January 15, 1848, John in 1851, and Robert in December 1853.
7975-280057-0005	My eldest brother Richard died in 1860.
7975-280057-0006	My father was in the employ of the United States government and had the mail contract for 500 miles.
7975-280057-0007	he had started back to harrisonville in a buggy but was waylaid one mile south of westport a suburb of kansas city and brutally murdered falling out of his buggy into the road with three mortal bullet wounds
7975-280057-0008	Miss Washington Wells and her son Samuel, on the road home from Kansas City to Lee's Summit, recognized the body as that of my father.
7975-280057-0009	miss wells stayed to guard the remains while her son carried the news of the murder to colonel peabody of the federal command who was then in camp at kansas city
7975-280057-0010	Miss McCorkle jumped from the window of the house and escaped.
7975-280057-0011	As the raiders left, one of them shouted,
7975-280057-0012	Now, old lady, call on your protectors. Why don't you call on Cole Younger now?
7975-280057-0013	every knot represented a human life.
7975-280057-0014	but she failed to find the comfort she sought, for annoyances continued in a more aggravated form.
7975-280057-0015	two months after this incident the same persecutors again entered our home in the dead of the night and at the point of a pistol tried to force my mother to set fire to her own home
7975-280057-0016	i have always felt that the exposure to which she was subjected on this cruel journey too hard even for a man to take was the direct cause of her death
7975-280057-0017	From Harrisonville she went to Waverly, where she was hounded continually.
7975-280057-0018	One of the conditions upon which her life was spared was that she would report at Lexington Weekly.
7975-280057-0019	One of my old school teachers, whom I have never seen since the spring or summer of 1862, is Stephen B. Elkins, Senator from West Virginia.
7975-280057-0020	When I was taken prisoner, I expected to be shot without ceremony.
7975-280063-0000	we took the oath perhaps three hundred of us down on luther mason's farm a few miles from where i now write where colonel hayes had encamped after independence

7975-280063-0002	Accordingly, I was shortly awakened to accompany him to Lone Jack, where he would personally make known the situation to the other colonels.
7975-280063-0003	Foster had nearly 1,000 cavalrymen and two pieces of Rab's Indiana Battery that had already made for itself a name for hard fighting.
7975-280063-0004	Come in, Colonel Hayes, exclaimed Colonel Cockerell.
7975-280063-0005	I think he'll be rather tough meat for breakfast, I replied. He might be all right for dinner.
7975-280063-0006	jackman with a party of thirty seasoned men charged the indiana guns and captured them but major foster led a gallant charge against the invaders and recaptured the pieces
7975-280063-0007	We were out of ammunition and were helpless had the fight been pressed.
7975-280063-0008	They did mark my clothes in one or two places, however.
7975-280063-0009	Major Foster, in a letter to Judge Georgie and Bennett of Minneapolis, said,
7975-280063-0010	I was told by some of our men from the western border of the state that they recognized the daring young rider as Cole Younger.
7975-280063-0011	About 9.30 a.m., I was shot down.
7975-280063-0012	The wounded of both forces were gathered up and were placed in houses.
7975-280076-0000	although every book purporting to narrate the lives of the younger brothers is told of the liberty robbery and implied that we had a part in it the youngers were not suspected at that time nor for a long time afterward
7975-280076-0001	it was claimed by people of liberty that they positively recognized among the robbers all shepard redmockers and bud pence who had seen service with
7975-280076-0002	This raid was accompanied by bloodshed. Judge McClain, the banker, being shot, though not fatally.
7975-280076-0003	no warrant was issued for the youngers but subsequent historians have inferentially at least accused us of taking part but as i said before there is no truth in the accusation
7975-280076-0004	June 3rd, 1871, Obecock Brothers Bank at Croydon, Iowa was robbed of $40,000 by seven men in broad daylight.
7975-280076-0005	It was charged that Arthur McCoy or A.C. McCoy and myself had been participants in the Gad's Hill affair and the two-stage robberies.
7975-280076-0006	The parts of this letter now relevant are as follows.
7975-280076-0007	You may use this letter in your own way.
7975-280076-0008	I will give you this outline and sketch of my whereabouts and actions at the time of certain robberies with which I am charged.
7975-280076-0009	At the time of the Gallatin bank robbery, I was gathering cattle in Ellis County, Texas. Cattle that I bought from Plez, Taylor, and Rector.
7975-280076-0010	This can be proved by both of them, also by Sheriff Barkley and 50 other respectable men of that county.
7975-280076-0011	I brought the cattle to Kansas that fall and remained in St. Clair County until February.
7975-280076-0012	I then went to Arkansas and returned to St. Clair County about the 1st of May.
7975-280076-0013	I went to Kansas where our cattle were in Woodson County at Colonel Ridges.
7975-280076-0014	During the summer, I was either in St. Clair, Jackson, or Kansas, but as there was no robbery committed that summer, it makes no difference where I was.
7975-280076-0015	I went through Independence and from there to Ace Webb's.
7975-280076-0016	There I took dinner and then went to Dr. L.W. Twyman's.
7975-280076-0017	Our business there was to see E.P. West. He was not at home, but the family will remember that we were there.
7975-280076-0018	We crossed on the bridge, stayed in the city all night, and the next morning we rode up through the city.
7975-280076-0019	I met several of my friends. Among them was Bob Hudspeth.
7975-280076-0020	We were not on good terms at the time, nor have we been for several years.
7975-280076-0021	Poor John, he has been hunted down and shot like a wild beast, and never was a boy more innocent.
7975-280076-0022	Dr. L. Lewis was his physician.
7975-280076-0023	There were 50 or 100 persons there who will testify in any court that John and I were there.
7975-280076-0024	helvin fickle and wife of greenston valley were attending the springs at that time and either of them will testify to the above for john and i sat in front of mr smith while he was preaching and was in his company for a few moments together with his wife and mr and miss fickle after the service
7975-280076-0025	About the last of December, 1873, I arrived in Carroll Parish, Louisiana.
7975-280076-0026	I stayed there until the 8th of February, 1874.
7975-280076-0027	i had not heard of that when i wrote the letter of eighteen seventy four and to correct any misapprehension that might be created by omitting it i will say that at the time i was at neosho kansas with a drove of cattle which i sold to major ray
7975-280076-0028	It was immediately following the Rock Island robbery at 8-Air Iowa that there first appeared a deliberate enlistment of some local papers in Missouri to connect us with this robbery.
7975-280084-0000	I urged on the boys that whatever happened, we should not shoot anyone.
7975-280084-0001	when miller and i crossed the bridge the three were on some dry-good boxes at the corner near the bank and as soon as they saw us went right into the bank instead of waiting for us to get there
7975-280084-0002	When we came up, I told Miller to shut the bank door, which they had left open in their hurry,
7975-280084-0003	J.S. Allen, whose hardware store was near, tried to go into the bank, but Miller ordered him away, and he ran around the corner shouting.
7975-280084-0004	Get your guns, boys. They're robbing the bank.
7975-280084-0005	and I called to him to get inside at the same time firing a pistol shot in the air as a signal to the three boys at the bridge that we had been discovered.
7975-280084-0006	Almost at this instant, I heard a pistol shot in the bank.
7975-280084-0007	chadwell woods and jim rode up and joined us shouting to the people in the street to get inside and firing their pistols to emphasize their commands
7975-280084-0008	If any of our party shot him, it must have been Woods.
7975-280084-0009	Meantime, the street was getting uncomfortably hot.
7975-280084-0010	Every time I saw anyone with a bead on me, I would drop off my horse and try to drive the shooter inside, but I could not see in every direction.
7975-280084-0011	Dr. Wheeler, who had gone upstairs in the hotel, shot Miller and he lay dying in the street.
7975-280084-0012	Changing his pistol to his left hand, Bob ran out and mounted Miller's mare,
7975-280084-0013	What kept you so long, I asked Pits.
7975-280084-0014	As to the rest of the affair inside the bank, I take the account of a Northfield narrator.
7975-280084-0015	"'Where's the money outside the safe?' Bob asked.
7975-280084-0016	The shutters were closed and this caused Bunker an instant delay that was almost fatal. Fitz chased him with a bullet.
7975-280084-0017	The first one missed him, but the second went through his right shoulder.
7975-280085-0000	That night it started to rain and we wore out our horses.
7975-280085-0001	Friday we move toward Waterville and Friday night we camp between Elysian and German Lake.
7975-280085-0002	bob's shattered elbow was requiring frequent attention and that night we made only nine miles and monday monday night and tuesday we spent in a deserted farmhouse close to mankato
7975-280085-0003	That day a man named Dunning discovered us and we took him prisoner.
7975-280085-0004	Finally, we administered to him an oath not to betray our whereabouts until we had time to make our escape, and he agreed not to.
7975-280085-0005	no sooner however was he released than he made post haste into mankato to announce our presence and in a few minutes another posse was looking for us
7975-280085-0006	The whistle on the oil mill blew, and we feared that it was a signal that had been agreed upon to alarm the town in case we were observed, but we were not molested.
7975-280085-0007	He had to sleep with that pillow on my breast Jim being also crippled with a wound in his shoulder And we could not get much sleep
7975-280085-0008	but they soon after got close enough so that one of them broke my walking stick with a shot.
7975-280085-0009	We were in sight of our long-sought horses when they cut us off from the animals, and our last hope was gone.
7975-280085-0010	Six steps to the front. Sheriff Glissman, Colonel T.L. Vaught, B.M. Rice, G.A. Bradford, C.A. Pomeroy, and S.J. Severson.
7975-280085-0011	forming in line four paces apart he ordered them to advance rapidly and concentrate the fire of the whole line the instant the robbers were discovered
7975-280085-0012	Make for the horses, I said, every man for himself.
7975-280085-0013	There's no use stopping to pick up a comrade here, for we can't get him through the line. Just charge them and make it if we can.
7975-280085-0014	I got up as a signal for the charge and we fired one volley.
7975-280085-0015	one of the fellows in the outer line not brave enough himself to join the volunteers who had come in to beat us out was not disposed to believe in the surrender and had his gun levelled on bob in spite of the handkerchief which was waving as a flag of truce
7975-280085-0016	Sheriff Glissman of Waterwon County, who was taking Bob's pistol from him, was also shouting to the fellow.
7975-280085-0017	including those received in and on the way from Northfield, I had 11 wounds.
7975-280085-0018	And Sheriff Glispin's order not to shoot was the beginning of the protectorate that Minnesota people established over us.
8131-117016-0000	Captain Murdock
8131-117016-0001	But Marsport had flourished enough to kill it off.
8131-117016-0002	Some of Marr's laws dated from the time when law enforcement had been hampered by lack of men, rather than by the type of men.
8131-117016-0003	The Stonewall gang numbered perhaps five hundred.
8131-117016-0004	even derelicts and failures had to eat there were stories and shops throughout the district which eked out some kind of a marginal living
8131-117016-0005	They were safe from protection racketeers there. None bothered to come so far out.
8131-117016-0006	The shopkeepers and some of the less unfortunate people there had protested loud enough to reach clear back to earth.
8131-117016-0007	Captain Murdock was an unknown factor, and now was asking for more men.
8131-117016-0008	The pressure was enough to get them for him.
8131-117016-0009	Gordon reported for work with a sense of the bottom falling out, mixed with a vague relief.
8131-117016-0010	I've got a free hand, and we're going to run this the way we would on Earth.
8131-117016-0011	Your job is to protect the citizens here, and that means everyone not breaking the laws. Whether you feel like it or not, no graft.
8131-117016-0012	The first man making a shakedown will get the same treatment we're going to use on the Stonewall Boys. You'll get double pay here, and you can live on it.
8131-117016-0013	He picked out five of the men, including Gordon. You five will come with me.
8131-117016-0014	The rest of you can team up any way you want tonight. Pick any route that's open. Okay, men, let's go.
8131-117016-0015	Bruce Gordon grinned slowly as he swung the stick, and Murdoch's eyes fell on him. Earth Cop?
8131-117016-0016	Two years, Gordon admitted.
8131-117016-0017	For a second, Gordon cursed himself.
8131-117016-0018	He began wondering about security then.
8131-117016-0019	Nobody had tried to get in touch with him.
8131-117016-0020	There was a crude lighting system here, put up by the citizens. At the front of each building a dim phosphor bulb glowed. When darkness fell, they would have nothing else to see by.
8131-117016-0021	Moving in two groups of threes, at opposite sides of the street, they began their beat.
8131-117016-0022	There was no chance to save the citizen who was dying from lack of air.
8131-117016-0023	Gordon felt the solid pleasure of the finely turned club in his hands.
8131-117016-0024	Gordon's eyes popped at that.
8131-117016-0025	He swallowed the sentiment. His own club was moving now.
8131-117016-0026	The other four cops had come in reluctantly.
8131-117016-0027	He brought him to the ground with a single blow across the kidneys.
8131-117016-0028	They rounded up the men of the gang, and one of the cops started off.
8131-117016-0029	to find a phone and call the wagon.
8131-117016-0030	We're not using wagons, Murdoch told him. Line them up.
8131-117016-0031	If they tried to run, they were hit from behind. If they stood still, they were clubbed carefully.
8131-117016-0032	Murdock indicated one who stood with his shoulders shaking and tears running down his cheeks.
8131-117016-0033	The captain's face was as sick as Gordon's felt.
8131-117016-0034	I want the name of every man in the gang you can remember, he told the man.
8131-117016-0035	Colonel, they'd kill me. I don't know.
8131-117016-0036	Murdock took his nod as evidence enough and turned to the wretched tufts
8131-117016-0037	If he should turn up dead, I'll know you boys are responsible, and I'll find you.
8131-117016-0038	Trouble began brewing shortly after, though.
8131-117016-0039	Murdock sent one of the men to pick up a second squad of six, and then a third.
8131-117016-0040	In the third one, Bruce Gordon spotted one of the men who'd been beaten before.
8131-117016-0041	Get a stretcher and take him wherever he belongs, he ordered.
8131-117016-0042	But the captain stirred finally, sighing.
8131-117016-0043	No. The cops are giving me. We're covered, Gordon.
8131-117016-0044	But the Stonewall gang is backing Wayne.
8131-117016-0045	but it's going to be tough on them.
8131-117016-0046	Bruce Gordon grimaced. I've got a yellow ticket from security.
8131-117016-0047	Murdock blinked. He dropped his eyes slowly.
8131-117016-0048	What makes you think Wayne will be re-elected?
8131-117016-0049	Nobody wants him except a gang of crooks and those in power.
8131-117016-0050	Ever see a Martian election?
8131-117016-0051	No, you're a firster. He can't lose.
8131-117016-0052	and then hell is going to pop, and this whole planet may be blown wide open.
8131-117016-0053	It fitted with the dire predictions of security and what the spying Gordon was going to do according to them.
8131-117016-0054	He was getting even fatter now that he was eating better food from the fair restaurant around the corner.
8131-117016-0055	"'cost them more, but they'd be respectable.'
8131-117016-0056	Because Izzy is always honest, according to how he sees it.
8131-117016-0057	But you got Earth ideas of the stuff, like I had once.
8131-117016-0058	The groups grew more experienced, and Murdock was training a new squad every night.
8131-117016-0059	It wasn't exactly legal, but nothing was here.
8131-117016-0060	This could lead to abuses as he'd seen on Earth.
8131-117016-0061	but there probably wouldn't be time for it if Mayor Wayne was re-elected.
8131-117017-0000	it was night outside and the phosphor bulbs at the corners glowed dimly giving him barely enough light by which to locate the way to the extemporized precinct house
8131-117017-0001	It had probably been years since any had dared risk it after the sun went down.
8131-117017-0002	and the slow doubtful respect on the faces of the citizens as they nodded to him was even more proof that haley's system was working
8131-117017-0003	Gordon hit the signal switch, and the Mars speaker let out a shrill whistle.
8131-117017-0004	Guns suddenly seemed to be flourishing everywhere.
8131-117017-0005	You can't do it to me.
8131-117017-0006	I'm reformed. I'm going straight.
8131-117017-0007	You damned cops can't. O'Neal was blubbering.
8131-117017-0008	one look was enough the work papers had the tell-tale over-thickening of the signature that had showed up on other papers obviously forgeries
8131-117017-0009	Some turned away as Gordon and the other cop went to work, but most of them weren't squeamish.
8131-117017-0010	When it was over, the two picked up their whimpering captive.
8131-117017-0011	Jenkins, the other cop, had been holding the wallet.
8131-117017-0012	Must have been making a big contact in something. 50-50?
8131-117017-0013	There must have been over two thousand credits in the wallet.
8131-117017-0014	When Gordon and Jenkins came back, Murdoch tossed the money to them, split it,
8131-117017-0015	Whatever comes to hand, guv'nor.
8131-117017-0016	Like this social call, Gordon asked him.
8131-117017-0017	The little man shook his head, his ancient 18-year-old face turning sober. Nope.
8131-117017-0018	You owe me some bills, guv'nor.
8131-117017-0019	1150 credits.
8131-117017-0020	You didn't pay up your pledge to the Captain Fund, so I had to fill in.
8131-117017-0021	A thousand interest at 10% a week. Standard, right?
8131-117017-0022	Gordon had heard of the friendly interest charged on the side here, but he shook his head. Wrong, Izzy.
8131-117017-0023	"'Huh?' Izzy turned it over and shook his head.
8131-117017-0024	Now show me where I signed any agreement saying I'd pay you back.
8131-117017-0025	For a second, Izzy's face went blank. Then he chuckled.
8131-117017-0026	He pulled out the bills and handed them over.
8131-117017-0027	Thanks, Izzy. Thanks yourself.
8131-117017-0028	The kid pocketed the money cheerfully, nodding.
8131-117017-0029	The little guy knew Mars as few others did, apparently, from all sides.
8131-117017-0030	and if any of the other cops had private rackets of their own izzy was undoubtedly the man to find it out and use the information with a beat such as that even going halves and with all the graft at the upper brackets he'd still be able to make his pile in a matter of months
8131-117017-0031	The captain looked completely beaten as he came into the room and dropped onto the bench.
8131-117017-0032	Go on, accept, damn it.
8131-117029-0000	There was a man coming from earth on a second ship who would see him.
8131-117029-0001	The little publisher was back at the Crusader again.
8131-117029-0002	Only Gordon and Sheila were left.
8131-117029-0003	Credit had been established again, and the businesses were open.
8131-117029-0004	Gordon came to a row of temporary bubbles, individual dwellings built like the dome, but opaque for privacy.
8131-117029-0005	They had been lucky.
8131-117029-0006	Schulberg's volunteers were official now.
8131-117029-0007	Fats place was still open, though the crooked tables had been removed. Gordon dropped to a stool, slipping off his helmet.
8131-117029-0008	He reached automatically for the glass of ether-needled beer.
8131-117029-0009	Thought you'd be in the chips.
8131-117029-0010	that's mars gordon echoed the other's comment why don't you pull off the planet vats you could go back to earth i'd guess the other nodded
8131-117029-0011	guess a man gets used to anything hell maybe i can hire some bums to sit around and whoop it up when the ships come in and bill this as a real old martian den of sin
8131-117029-0012	There was a grin on the other's face.
8131-117029-0013	Finally got our orders for you. It's Mercury.
8131-117029-0014	We sent 20 others the same way, and they failed.
8131-117029-0015	Let's say you've shifted some of the misery around a bit and given them a chance to do better.
8131-117029-0016	You can't stay here.
8131-117029-0017	There's a rocket waiting to transship you to the moon on the way to Mercury right now. Gordon sighed.
8131-117029-0018	And I paid her the pay we owe you from the time you began using your badge. She's out shopping.
8131-117029-0019	But his old eyes were glinting.
8131-117029-0020	"'Did you think we'd let you go without seeing you off, Cobber?' he asked.
8131-117029-0021	I, I, oh, drat it, I'm getting old, Izzy, you tell him.
8131-117029-0022	He grabbed Gordon's hand and waddled down the landing plank. Izzy shook his head.
8188-269288-0000	Annie Colchester had begun to make friends with Leslie.
8188-269288-0001	Leasley determined to try for honours in English language and literature.
8188-269288-0002	her tastes all lay in this direction her idea being by and by to follow her mother's profession of journalism for which she already showed considerable aptitude
8188-269288-0003	She had no idea of allowing herself to break down.
8188-269288-0004	"'What do you mean?' replied Leslie.
8188-269288-0005	Why, you will be parting from me, you know.
8188-269288-0006	I won't be the constant worry and plague of your life.
8188-269288-0007	it is this if by any chance you don't leave st wode's annie i hope you will allow me to be your room-fellow again next term
8188-269288-0008	said annie, a flash of light coming into her eyes, and then leaving them.
8188-269288-0009	"'But,' she added abruptly, "'you speak of something which must not take place.'
8188-269288-0010	"'I must pass an honours. "'If I don't, I shall die.'
8188-269288-0011	A few moments later, there came a tap at the door.
8188-269288-0012	Leslie opened the door.
8188-269288-0013	Jane Herriot stood without.
8188-269288-0014	"'These letters have just come for you and Annie Colchester,' she said. "'And, as I was coming upstairs, I thought I would leave them with you.'
8188-269288-0015	Leslie thanked her and eagerly grasped the little parcel.
8188-269288-0016	her eyes shone with pleasure at the anticipation of the delightful time she would have revelling in the home news the other letter was directed to annie colchester
8188-269288-0017	"'Here is a letter for you, Annie,' cried Leslie.'
8188-269288-0018	Her face grew suddenly white as death. What is a death?
8188-269288-0019	I have been starving, or rather, I have been thirsting.
8188-269288-0020	"'Well, read it in peace,' said Ledersley. "'I won't disturb you.'
8188-269288-0021	I am truly glad it has come.
8188-269288-0022	Leslie seated herself with her back to her companion and opened her own letters.
8188-269288-0023	"'Don't notice me,' replied Annie.
8188-269288-0024	I must go into the grounds. The air is stifling.
8188-269288-0025	But they are just shutting up.
8188-269288-0026	"'I shall go. I know a way.'
8188-269288-0027	Just after midnight, she rose with a sigh to prepare for bed.
8188-269288-0028	She looked round the room.
8188-269288-0029	Now I remember. She got a letter which upset her very much and went out.
8188-269288-0030	leslie went to the window and flung it open she put her head out and tried to peer into the darkness but the moon had already set and she could not see more than a couple of yards in front of her
8188-269288-0031	She is a very queer, erratic creature. And that letter. There was bad news in that letter.
8188-269288-0032	What can she be doing out by herself?
8188-269288-0033	leslie left the room but she had scarcely gone a dozen places down the corridor before she met annie returning
8188-269288-0034	Annie's eyes were very bright, her cheeks were no longer pale, and there was a brilliant colour in them.
8188-269288-0035	She did not take the least notice of Leslie, but, going into the room, shut the door.
8188-269288-0036	Don't begin. See you, Danny.
8188-269288-0037	Don't begin. What do you mean?
8188-269288-0038	I mean that I don't want you to begin to ask questions.
8188-269288-0039	I walked up and down as fast as ever I could outside in order to make myself sleepy.
8188-269288-0040	Don't talk to me, Leslie. Don't say a single word.
8188-269288-0041	I shall go off to sleep. That is all I care for.
8188-269288-0042	Do it! See you then!
8188-269288-0043	"'Now, drink this at once,' she said in a voice of authority. "'If you really wish to sleep.'
8188-269288-0044	Annie stared vacantly at the cocoa. Then she uttered a laugh.
8188-269288-0045	"'Drink that?' she said.
8188-269288-0046	Do you want to kill me? Don't talk anymore.
8188-269288-0047	I am sleepy. I shall sleep.
8188-269288-0048	She got into bed as she spoke, and wrapped the clothes tightly round her,
8188-269288-0049	Can't you manage with a candle? Just for once.
8188-269288-0050	Certainly, said Leslie.
8188-269288-0051	She turned off the light and lit a candle, which she put behind her screen, then prepared to get into bed.
8188-269288-0052	Annie's manner was very mysterious.
8188-269288-0053	Annie did not mean to confine anyone that night, and the kindest thing was to leave her alone.
8188-269288-0054	Tired out, Lizley herself dropped asleep.
8188-269288-0055	"'Annie, is that you?' she called out.
8188-269288-0056	There was no reply, but the sound of hurrying steps came quicker and quicker. Now and then they were interrupted by a groan.
8188-269288-0057	Oh, this will kill me! My heart will break! This will kill me!
8188-269290-0000	The Guild of St Elizabeth
8188-269290-0001	Immediately after dinner that evening, Leslie ran up to her room to make preparations for her visit to East Hall.
8188-269290-0002	I'm not coming, said Annie.
8188-269290-0003	Every student is to be in East Hall at half past eight.
8188-269290-0004	"'It doesn't matter,' replied Annie. "'Whether it is an order or not. "'I'm not coming. "'Say nothing about me, please.'
8188-269290-0005	It burned as if with fever.
8188-269290-0006	You don't know what a trial it is for me to have you here.
8188-269290-0007	I want to be alone. Go!
8188-269290-0008	"'I know you don't quite mean what you say,' said Leslie. "'But, of course, if you really wish me—'
8188-269290-0009	you fret me beyond endurance
8188-269290-0010	Wrapping a pretty blue shawl around her head and shoulders, she turned to Annie.
8188-269290-0011	Leslie was just closing the door behind her when Annie called after her.
8188-269290-0012	I took it out, said Leslie. Took it out?
8188-269290-0013	Have the goodness to find it and put it back.
8188-269290-0014	"'But don't lock me out, please, Annie.'
8188-269290-0015	oh i won't lock you out she said but i must have the key
8188-269290-0016	Jane Herriot's voice was heard in the passage.
8188-269290-0017	As she walked down the corridor, she heard it being turned in the lock.
8188-269290-0018	"'What can this mean?' she said to herself.'
8188-269290-0019	"'Oh, I won't press you,' replied Jane.'
8188-269290-0020	"'Oh, I shall never do that,' replied Leslie.
8188-269290-0021	you see all the girls except aileen and marjory laugh at her and that seems to me to make her worse
8188-269290-0022	"'Someday, Jane, you must see her.'
8188-269290-0023	If you are in London during the summer, you must come and pay us a visit. Will you?
8188-269290-0024	"'That is, if you care to confide in me.'
8188-269290-0025	"'I believe poor Annie is dreadfully unhappy.'
8188-269290-0026	"'That's just it, Jane. "'That is what frightens me. "'She refuses to come.'
8188-269290-0027	"'Refuses to come,' she cried.
8188-269290-0028	She'll get an awful scrape.
8188-269290-0029	I am sure she is ill. She works too hard and she... But there, I don't know that I ought to say any more.
8188-269290-0030	"'I'll wait for you here,' said Lizzy.
8188-269290-0031	Do come, Annie, do!
8188-269290-0032	scarcely likely replied leslie she told me she was determined not to come to the meeting
8188-269290-0033	but marjorie and eileen had already departed and leslie and jane found themselves among the last students to arrive at the great east hall
8188-269290-0034	miss lauderdale was standing with the other tutors and principals of the different halls on a raised platform
8188-269290-0035	Then a roll call was gone through by one of the tutors. The only absentee was Annie Colchester.
8188-269290-0036	the physical part of your training and also the mental part are abundantly supplied in this great house of learning she continued but the spiritual part it seems to me ought now to be strengthened
8188-269290-0037	Hair, hair, and once again hair.
8188-269290-0038	She uttered her stream of mark, standing up.
8188-269290-0039	Marjorie and Eileen were close to her.
8188-269290-0040	i will talk with you belle archison presently she said
8188-269290-0041	The names of the proposed members are to be submitted to me before this day week.
8188-269290-0042	Am I my brother's keeper?
8188-269290-0043	"'You ask?' she continued.
8188-269290-0044	God answers to each of you. You are.
8188-269290-0045	The world says, no I am not. But God says, yes you are.
8188-269290-0046	All men are your brothers.
8188-269290-0047	For all who sin, all who suffer, you are to a certain extent responsible.
8188-269290-0048	After the address, the girls themselves were encouraged to speak, and a very animated discussion followed.
8188-269290-0049	It was past ten o'clock when she left the hall.
8188-269290-0050	Just as she was doing so, Miss Freya came up.
8188-269290-0051	"'Any Colchester is your room-fellow, is she not?' she said.
8188-269290-0052	"'I see by your face, Miss Gilroy, that you are distressed about something. "'Are you keeping anything back?'
8188-269290-0053	i am afraid i am replied lizzie distressed now in her tone
8188-269290-0054	i must see her myself early in the morning and i am quite sure that nothing will satisfy miss lauderdale except a very ample apology and a full explanation of the reason why she absented herself
8188-269290-0055	Excuses make no difference.
8188-269290-0056	The girl who breaks the rules has to be punished.
8188-269290-0057	I will tell her.
8188-274364-0000	the commons also voted that the new created peers ought to have no voice in this trial because the accusation being agreed to while they were commoners their consent to it was implied with that of all the commons of england
8188-274364-0001	in the government of ireland his administration had been equally promotive of his master's interest and that of the subjects committed to his care
8188-274364-0002	the case of lord montnoris of all those which were collected with so much industry is the most flagrant and the least excusable
8188-274364-0003	the court which consisted of the chief officials of the army found the crime to be capital and condemned that nobleman to lose his head
8188-274364-0004	with a token by which I shall discover it.
8188-274364-0005	it is now a full two hundred and forty years since treasons were defined and so long has it been since any man was touched to this extent upon this crime before myself
8188-274364-0006	let us not to our own destruction awake those sleeping lions by rattling up a company of old records which have lain for so many ages by the wall forgotten and neglected
8188-274364-0007	however these gentlemen at the bar say they speak for the commonwealth and they believe so yet under favour it is i who in this particular speak for the commonwealth
8188-274364-0008	"'My lords, I have now troubled your lordships a great deal longer than I should have done.'
8188-274364-0009	young vane falling upon this paper of notes deemed the matter of the utmost importance and immediately communicated it to pym who now produced the paper before the house of commons
8188-274364-0010	the king proposes this difficulty but how can i undertake offensive war if i have no more money
8188-274364-0011	Your majesty, having tried the affections of your people, you are absolved and loose from all rules of government, and may do what power will admit.
8280-266249-0000	old mr dinsmore had accepted a pressing invitation from his granddaughter and her husband to join the party and with the addition of servants it was a large one
8280-266249-0001	as they were in no haste and the confinement of a railroad car would be very irksome to the younger children it had been decided to make the journey by water
8280-266249-0002	there were no sad leave-takings to mar their pleasure the children were in wild spirits and all seemed cheerful and happy as they sat or stood upon the deck watching the receding shore as the vessel steamed out of the harbor
8280-266249-0003	at length the land had quite disappeared nothing could be seen but the sky overhead and a vast expanse of water all round and the passengers found leisure to turn their attention upon each other
8280-266249-0004	there are some nice-looking people on board remarked mr travilla in an undertone to his wife
8280-266249-0005	"'Besides ourselves,' added Cousin Ronald, laughing.
8280-266249-0006	yes she answered that little group yonder a young minister and his wife and child i suppose
8280-266249-0007	"'And what a dear little fellow he is. "'Just about the age of our Harold, I should judge.'
8280-266249-0008	"'Do you, son?' was the smiling rejoinder.
8280-266249-0009	"'He certainly looks like a very nice little boy.'
8280-266249-0010	"'Suppose you and he shake hands, Frank?'
8280-266249-0011	i do indeed though probably comparatively few are aware that tobacco is the cause of their ailments
8280-266249-0012	doubtless that is the case remarked mr dinsmore
8280-266249-0013	"'With all my heart, if you will step into the gentleman's cabin where there's a light.'
8280-266249-0014	he led the way the others all following and taking out a slip of paper read from it in a distinct tone loud enough to be heard by those all about him without disturbing the other passengers
8280-266249-0015	one drop of nicotine extract of tobacco placed on the tongue of the dog will kill him in a minute the hundredth part of a grain pricked under the skin of a man's arm will produce nausea and fainting
8280-266249-0016	the half dozen cigars which most smokers use a day contain six or seven grains enough if concentrated and absorbed to kill three men and a pound of tobacco according to its quality contains from one quarter to one and a quarter ounces
8280-266249-0017	is it strange then that smokers and chewers have a thousand ailments
8280-266249-0018	that the french polytechnic institute had to prohibit its use on account of its effects upon the mind
8280-266249-0019	Notice the multitude of sudden deaths and see how many are smokers and chewers.
8280-266249-0020	in a small country town seven of these mysterious providences occurred within the circuit of a mile all directly traceable to tobacco and any physician on a few moments reflection can match this fact by his own observation
8280-266249-0021	and then such powerful acids produce intense irritation and thirst thirst which water does not quench
8280-266249-0022	Hence a resort to cider and beer.
8280-266249-0023	no sir what know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which ye have of god and ye are not your own
8280-266249-0024	for you are bought with a price. Therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.
8280-266249-0025	We certainly have no right to injure our bodies, either by neglect or self-indulgence.
8280-266249-0026	and again i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice wholly acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service
8280-266249-0027	it must require a good deal of resolution for one who has become fond of the indulgence to give it up remarked mr daly
8280-266249-0028	no doubt no doubt returned mr lilburn but if thy right eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell
8280-266249-0029	there was a pause broken by young horace who had been watching a group of men gathered about a table at the further end of the room
8280-266249-0030	they are gambling yonder and i'm afraid that young fellow is being badly fleeced by the middle-aged man opposite
8280-266249-0031	The eyes of the whole party were at once turned in that direction.
8280-266249-0032	No, sir, he is not here.
8280-266249-0033	And the door was slammed violently, too.
8280-266249-0034	now the voice came from the skylight overhead apparently and with a fierce imprecation the irate gamester rushed upon deck and ran hither and thither in search of his tormentor
8280-266249-0035	his victim who had been looking on during the little scene and listening to the mysterious voice in silent wide-eyed wonder and fear now rose hastily his face deathly pale with trembling hands gathered up the money he had staked and hurrying to his stateroom locked himself in
8280-266249-0036	"'What does it mean?' cried one.
8280-266249-0037	a ventriloquist aboard of course returned another let's follow and see the fun
8280-266249-0038	"'I wonder which of us it is,' remarked the first, looking hard at our party. "'I don't know, but come on.'
8280-266249-0039	that fellow nick ward is a noted black lagoon ruffian had his nose broken in a fight and is sensitive on the subject was cheating of course
8280-266249-0040	who asked the mate i've seen none up here though there are some in the steerage
8280-266249-0041	they heard him in silence with a cool phlegmatic indifference most exasperating to one in his present mood
8280-266249-0042	a man of giant size and herculean strength had laid aside his pipe and slowly rising to his feet seized the scoundrel in his powerful grasp
8280-266249-0043	"'Let me go!' yelled Ward, making a desperate effort to free his arms.
8280-266249-0044	i thinks no i thinks i did you fun lesson returned his captor not relaxing his grasp in the least
8280-266249-0045	the german released his prisoner and the latter slunk away with muttered threats and imprecations upon the head of his tormentor
8280-266249-0046	mr lilburn and mr daly each at a different time sought out the young man ward's intended victim and tried to influence him for good
8280-266249-0047	yet there was gambling again the second night between ward and several others of his profession
8280-266249-0048	"'They kept it up till after midnight.'
8280-266249-0049	then mr lilborn waking from his first sleep in a state-room near by thought he would break it up once more
8280-266249-0050	an intense voiceless excitement possessed the players for the game was a close one and the stakes were very heavy
8280-266249-0051	they bent eagerly over the board each watching with feverish anxiety his companion's movements each casting now and again a gloating eye upon the heap of gold and greenbacks that lay between them and at times half stretching out his hand to clutch it
8280-266249-0052	a deep groan startled them and they sprang to their feet pale and trembling with sudden terror each holding his breath and straining his ear to catch a repetition of the dread sound
8280-266249-0053	but all was silent and after a moment of anxious waiting they sat down to their game again trying to conceal and shake off their fears with a forced unnatural laugh
8280-266249-0054	it came from under the table gasped jord look what's there look yourself
8280-266249-0055	what can it have been they asked each other
8280-266249-0056	Oh, nonsense. What fools we are.
8280-266249-0057	It was the last game of cards for that trip.
8280-266249-0058	the captain coming in shortly after the sudden flight of the gamblers took charge of the money and the next day restored it to the owners
8280-266249-0059	To Elsie's observant eyes, it presently became evident that the Dailies were in very straitened circumstances.
8280-266249-0060	oh how kind how very kind mrs daly said with tears of joy and gratitude we have hardly known how we should meet the most necessary expenses of this trip but have been trying to cast our care upon the lord asking him to provide
8280-266249-0061	and how wonderfully he has answered our petitions.
8280-266249-0062	Elsie answered pressing her hand affectionately are we not sisters in Christ
8280-266249-0063	Ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.
8280-266249-0064	Ye are all one in Christ Jesus.
8280-266249-0065	we feel my husband and i that we are only the stewards of his bounty and because he has said inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me it is the greatest privilege and delight to do anything for his people
8461-258277-0000	When it was the seven hundred and eighteenth night,
8461-258277-0001	But he answered, Needs my style have zainab also. Now suddenly there came a rap at the door, and the maid said, Who is at the door?
8461-258277-0002	The knocker replied, Kamar, daughter of Azariah the Jew, say me, is Ali of Cairo with you?
8461-258277-0003	replied the broker's daughter, O thou daughter of a dog!
8461-258277-0004	And having thus Islamised, she asked him, Two men in the faith of al-Islam give marriage portions to women, or do women endow a man?
8461-258277-0005	And she threw down the Jew's head before him.
8461-258277-0006	Now, the course of her slaying her sire was as follows.
8461-258277-0007	Then he set out rejoicing to return to the barrack of the Forty.
8461-258277-0008	so he ate and fell down senseless for the sweetmeats were drugged with bhang whereupon the kazi bundled him into the sack and made off with him charger and chest and all to the barrack of the forty
8461-258277-0009	Presently, Hassan Schumann came out of a closet and said to him, "'Hast thou gotten the gear, O Ali?'
8461-258277-0010	So he told him what had befallen him, and added, If I know whither the rascal is gone, and where to find the knave, I would pay him out.
8461-258277-0011	"'Knowest thou whither he went?'
8461-258277-0012	"'Answered Hassan, I know where he is, and opening the door of the closet, showed him the sweetmeat cellar within, drugged and senseless.'
8461-258277-0013	so i went round about the highways of the city till i met a sweetmeat seller and buying his clothes and stock in trade and gear for ten dinars did what was done
8461-258277-0014	Quoth Ar-Rashid, Whose head is this?
8461-258277-0015	so ali related to him all that had passed from first to last and the caliph said i had not thought that thou wouldst kill him for that he was a sorcerer
8461-258277-0016	He replied, "'I have forty lads, but they are in Cairo.'
8461-278226-0000	And Laura had her own pet plans.
8461-278226-0001	she meant to be scrupulously conscientious in the administration of her talents and sometimes at church on a sunday when the sermon was particularly awakening she mentally debated a serious question as to whether new bonnets and a pair of jouvain's gloves daily were not sinful but i think she decided that the new bonnets and gloves were on the whole a pardonable weakness as being good for trade
8461-278226-0002	one morning laura told her husband with a gay laugh that she was going to victimize him but he was to promise to be patient and bear with her for once in a way
8461-278226-0003	I want to see all the pictures, the modern pictures especially.
8461-278226-0004	I remember all the Rubenses at the Louvre, for I saw them three years ago, when I was staying in Paris with Grandpapa.
8461-278226-0005	she returned in a little more than ten minutes in the freshest toilette all pale shimmering blue like the spring sky with pearl-gray gloves and boots and parasol and a bonnet that seemed made of azure butterflies
8461-278226-0006	he was drawing towards the close of this delightful honeymoon tour and it was a bright sunshiny morning early in february but february in paris is sometimes better than april in london
8461-278226-0007	But she fixed upon a picture which she said she preferred to anything she had seen in the gallery.
8461-278226-0008	Philip Joslin was examining some pictures on the other side of the room when his wife made this discovery.
8461-278226-0009	how i wish you could get me a copy of that picture philip laura said entreatingly
8461-278226-0010	I should so like one to hang in my morning-room at Jocelyn's Rock.'
8461-278226-0011	she turned to the french artist presently and asked him where the elder mr kirstall lived and if there was any possibility of seeing him
8461-278226-0012	They have said that he is even a little imbecile, that he does not remember himself of the most common events of his life.
8461-278226-0013	But there are some others who say that his memory has not altogether failed, and that he is still enough harshly critical towards the works of others.
8461-278226-0014	I don't think you will have any difficulty in finding the house.
8461-278226-0015	You will be doing me such a favour, Philip, if you'll say yes!
8461-281231-0000	his followers rushed forward to where he lay and their united force compelling the black knight to pause they dragged the wounded leader within the walls
8461-281231-0001	it was on their journey to that town that they were overtaken on the road by cedric and his party in whose company they were afterwards carried captive to the castle of torquil stone
8461-281231-0002	as he lay upon his bed wracked with pain and mental agony and filled with the fear of rapidly approaching death he heard a voice address him
8461-281231-0003	"'What art thou?' he exclaimed in terror.
8461-281231-0004	Leave me, and seek the Saxon witch, Eureka, who was my temptress. Let her, as well as I, taste the tortures which anticipate hell.
8461-281231-0005	exclaimed the Norman. "'Ho!'
8461-281231-0006	rememberest thou the magazine of fuel that is stored beneath these apartments woman
8461-281231-0007	they are fast rising at least said eureka and a signal shall soon wave to warn the besiegers to press hard upon those who would extinguish them
8461-281231-0008	meanwhile the black knight had led his forces again to the attack and so vigorous was their assault that before long the gate of the castle alone separated them from those within
8461-281231-0009	the defenders finding the castle to be on fire now determined to sell their lives as dearly as they could and headed by the braesie they threw open the gate and were at once involved in a terrific conflict with those outside
8461-281231-0010	The black knight, with portentous strength, forced his way inward in despite of de Bracey and his followers.
8461-281231-0011	Two of the foremost instantly fell, and the rest gave way, notwithstanding all the leader's efforts to stop them.
8461-281231-0012	The Black Knight was soon engaged in desperate combat with the Norman chief, and the vaulted roof of the hall rung with a furious blow.
8461-281231-0013	At length the Bracey fell.
8461-281231-0014	Tell me thy name, or work thy pleasure on me.
8461-281231-0015	"'Yet first let me say,' said de Bracey, "'what it imports thee to know.'
8461-281231-0016	exclaimed the Black Knight. "'Prisoner! And perish!'
8461-281231-0017	"'The life of every man in the castle shall answer it if a hair of his head be singed. Show me his chamber.'
8461-281231-0018	raising the wounded man with ease the black knight rushed with him to the postern gate and having there delivered his burden to the care of two yeomen he again entered the castle to assist in the rescue of the other prisoners
8461-281231-0019	but in other parts the besiegers pursued the defenders of the castle from chamber to chamber and satiated in their blood the vengeance which had long animated them against the soldiers of the tyrant front above
8461-281231-0020	As the fire commenced to spread rapidly through all parts of the castle, Ulrica appeared on one of the turrets.
8461-281231-0021	before long the towering flames had surmounted every obstruction and rose through the evening skies one huge and burning beacon seen far and wide through the adjacent country tower after tower crashed down with blazing roof and rafter
8461-281231-0022	At length, with a terrific crash, the whole turret gave way, and she perished in the flames which had consumed her tyrant.
8461-281231-0023	When the outlaws had divided the spoils which they had taken from the castle of Torkelstone, Cedric prepared to take his departure.
8461-281231-0024	he left the gallant band of foresters sorrowing deeply for his lost friend the lord of konigsberg and he and his followers had scarce departed when a procession moved slowly from under the greenwood branches in the direction which he had taken in the centre of which was the car in which the body of adelstein was laid
8461-281231-0025	the brazy bowed low and in silence threw himself upon a horse and galloped off through the wood
8461-281231-0026	Here is a bugle which an English yeoman has once worn. I pray you to keep it as a memorial of your gallant bearing."
8461-281231-0027	So saying, he mounted his strong war-horse and rode off through the forest.
8461-281231-0028	during all this time isaac of york sat mournfully apart grieving for the loss of his dearly loved daughter rebecca
8461-281231-0029	And with this epistle the unhappy old man set out to procure his daughter's liberation.
8461-281231-0030	the templar is fled said de brecy in answer to the prince's eager questions from the boeuf you will never see more and he added in a low and emphatic tone richard is in england i have seen him and spoken with him
8461-281231-0031	he appealed to de brecy to assist him in this project and became at once deeply suspicious of the knight's loyalty towards him when he declined to lift hand against the man who had spared his own life
8461-281231-0032	Before reaching his destination, he was told that Lucas de Beaumanoir, the Grand Master of the Order of the Templars, was then on visit to the preceptory.
8461-281231-0033	he had not until then been informed of the presence of the jewish maiden in the abode of the templars and great was his fury and indignation on learning that she was amongst them
8461-281231-0034	poor isaac was hurried off accordingly and expelled from the preceptory all his entreaties and even his offers unheard and disregarded
8461-281231-0035	the assurance that she possessed some friend in this awful assembly gave her courage to look around and to mark into whose presence she had been conducted
8461-281231-0036	She gazed accordingly upon a scene which might well have struck terror into a bolder heart than hers.
8461-281231-0037	At his feet was placed a table, occupied by two scribes, whose duty it was to record the proceedings of the day.
8461-281231-0038	the preceptors of whom there were four present occupied seats behind the superiors and behind them stood the esquires of the order robed in white
