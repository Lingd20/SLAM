1089-134686-0000	he hoped there would be stew for dinner turnips and carrots and bruised potatoes and fat mutton pieces to be ladled out in thick peppered flour fattened sauce
1089-134686-0001	"'Stuff it into you,' his belly counselled him.
1089-134686-0002	After early nightfall the yellow lamps would light up here and there the squalid quarter of the brothels.
1089-134686-0003	"'Hello, Bertie. Any good in your mind?'
1089-134686-0004	Number 10. Fresh Nelly is waiting on you. Good night, husband.
1089-134686-0005	the music came nearer and he recalled the words the words of shelley's fragment upon the moon wandering companionless pale for weariness
1089-134686-0006	the dull light fell more faintly upon the page whereon another equation began to unfold itself slowly and to spread abroad its widening tail
1089-134686-0007	A cold, lucid indifference reigned in his soul.
1089-134686-0008	The chaos in which his ardor extinguished itself was a cold indifferent knowledge of himself,
1089-134686-0009	At most, by an alms given to a beggar whose blessing he fled from, he might hope wearily to win for himself some measure of actual grace.
1089-134686-0010	"'Well now, Ennis, I declare you have a head and so has my stick.'
1089-134686-0011	on saturday mornings when the sodality met in the chapel to recite the little office his place was a cushioned kneeling desk at the right of the altar from which he led his wing of boys through the responses
1089-134686-0012	her eyes seemed to regard him with mild pity her holiness a strange light glowing faintly upon her frail flesh did not humiliate the sinner who approached her
1089-134686-0013	if ever he was impelled to cast sin from him and to repent the impulse that moved him was the wish to be her knight
1089-134686-0014	He tried to think how it could be
1089-134686-0015	but the dusk, deepening in the schoolroom, covered over his thoughts. The bell rang.
1089-134686-0016	Then you can ask him questions on the catechism, Daedalus.
1089-134686-0017	Stephen, leaning back and drawing idly on his scribbler, listened to the talk about him which Heron checked from time to time by saying,
1089-134686-0018	it was strange too that he found an arid pleasure in following up to the end the rigid lines of the doctrines of the church and penetrating into obscure silences only to hear and feel the more deeply his own condemnation
1089-134686-0019	the sentence of st james which says that he who offends against one commandment becomes guilty of all had seemed to him first a swollen phrase until he had begun to grope in the darkness of his own state
1089-134686-0020	if a man had stolen a pound in his youth and had used that pound to amass a huge fortune how much was he obliged to give back the pound he had stolen only or the pound together with the compound interest accruing upon it or all his huge fortune
1089-134686-0021	If a layman, in giving baptism, pour the water before saying the words, is the child baptized?
1089-134686-0022	How comes it that while the first beatitude promises the kingdom of heaven to the poor of heart, the second beatitude promises also to the meek that they shall possess the land?
1089-134686-0023	why was the sacrament of the eucharist instituted under the two species of bread and wine if jesus christ be present body and blood soul and divinity in the bread alone and in the wine alone
1089-134686-0024	if the wine change into vinegar and the host crumble into corruption after they have been consecrated is jesus christ still present under their species as god and as man
1089-134686-0025	A gentle kick from the tall boy in the bench behind urged Stephen to ask a difficult question.
1089-134686-0026	The rector did not ask for a catechism to hear the lesson from.
1089-134686-0027	He clasped his hands on the desk and said,
1089-134686-0028	The retreat will begin on Wednesday afternoon in honor of St. Francis Xavier, whose feast day is Saturday.
1089-134686-0029	On Friday, confession will be heard all the afternoon after beads.
1089-134686-0030	Beware of making that mistake.
1089-134686-0031	Stephen's heart began slowly to fold and fade with fear like a withering flower.
1089-134686-0032	He is called, as you know, the Apostle of the Indies.
1089-134686-0033	a great saint, Saint Francis Xavier.
1089-134686-0034	The rector paused, and then, shaking his clasped hands before him, went on.
1089-134686-0035	He had the faith in him that moves mountains.
1089-134686-0036	a great saint, Saint Francis Xavier,
1089-134686-0037	In the silence their dark fire kindled the dusk into a tawny glow.
1089-134691-0000	He could wait no longer.
1089-134691-0001	For a full hour he had paced up and down, waiting, but he could wait no longer.
1089-134691-0002	He set off abruptly for the bull, walking rapidly lest his father's shrill whistle might call him back, and in a few moments he had rounded the curve at the police barrack and was safe.
1089-134691-0003	The university.
1089-134691-0004	Pride after satisfaction uplifted him like long, slow waves.
1089-134691-0005	whose feet are as the feet of hearts and underneath the everlasting arms.
1089-134691-0006	The pride of that dim image brought back to his mind the dignity of the office he had refused.
1089-134691-0007	Soon the whole bridge was trembling and resounding.
1089-134691-0008	the uncouth faces passed him two by two stained yellow or red or livid by the sea and as he strove to look at them with ease and indifference a faint stain of personal shame and commiseration rose to his own face
1089-134691-0009	Angry with himself, he tried to hide his face from their eyes by gazing down sideways into the shallow, swirling water under the bridge, but he still saw a reflection therein of their top-heavy silk hats, and humble, tape-like collars, and loosely hanging clerical clothes. "'Brother Hickey!'
1089-134691-0010	Brother McArdle. Brother Keeof.
1089-134691-0011	their piety would be like their names like their faces like their clothes and it was idle for him to tell himself that their humble and contrite hearts it might be paid a far richer tribute of devotion than his had ever been a gift tenfold more acceptable than his elaborate adoration
1089-134691-0012	it was idle for him to move himself to be generous towards them to tell himself that if he ever came to their gates stripped of his pride beaten and in beggars weeds that they would be generous towards him loving him as themselves
1089-134691-0013	idle and embittering finally to argue against his own dispassionate certitude that the commandment of love bade us not to love our neighbor as ourselves with the same amount and intensity of love but to love him as ourselves with the same kind of love
1089-134691-0014	The phrase and the day and the scene harmonized in accord.
1089-134691-0015	Words. Was it their colors?
1089-134691-0016	They were voyaging across the deserts of the sky, a host of nomads on the march, voyaging high over Ireland, westward bound.
1089-134691-0017	the europe they had come from lay out there beyond the irish sea europe of strange tongues and valleyed and wood begirt and citadel'd and of entrenched and marshall'd races
1089-134691-0018	again, again,
1089-134691-0019	A voice from beyond the world was calling.
1089-134691-0020	"'Hello, Stephanos. Here comes the Daedalus.'
1089-134691-0021	their diving stone poised on its rude supports and rocking under their plunges and the rough-hewn stones of the sloping breakwater over which they scrambled in their horseplay gleamed with cold wet lustre
1089-134691-0022	He stood still in deference to their calls, and parried their banter with easy words.
1089-134691-0023	It was a pain to see them, and a sword-like pain to see the signs of adolescence that made repellent their pitiable nakedness.
1089-134691-0024	Stefanos Derlos
1089-134691-0025	A moment before, the ghost of the ancient kingdom of the Danes had looked forth through the vesture of the haze-wrapped city.
1188-133604-0000	you will find me continually speaking of four men titian holbein turner and tintoret in almost the same terms
1188-133604-0001	They unite every quality. And sometimes you will find me referring to them as colorists, sometimes as chiaroscurists.
1188-133604-0002	by being studious of colour they are studious of division and while the chiaroscurist devotes himself to the representation of degrees of force in one thing unseparated light the colourists have for their function the attainment of beauty by arrangement of the divisions of light
1188-133604-0003	my first and principal reason was that they enforced beyond all resistance on any student who might attempt to copy them this method of laying portions of distinct hue side by side
1188-133604-0004	some of the touches indeed when the tint has been mixed with much water have been laid in little drops or ponds so that the pigment might crystallize hard at the edge
1188-133604-0005	It is the head of a parrot with a little flower in his beak from a picture of Carpatius, one of his series of The Life of St. George.
1188-133604-0006	Then he comes to the beak of it.
1188-133604-0007	the brown ground beneath is left for the most part one touch of black is put for the hollow two delicate lines of dark grey define the outer curve and one little quivering touch of white draws the inner edge of the mandible
1188-133604-0008	for believe me the final philosophy of art can only ratify their opinion that the beauty of a cock-robin is to be red and of a grass-plot to be green and the best skill of art is in instantly seizing on the manifold deliciousness of light which you can only seize by precision of instantaneous touch
1188-133604-0009	now you will see in these studies that the moment the white is enclosed properly and harmonized with the other hues it becomes somehow more precious and pearly than the white paper and that i am not afraid to leave a whole field of untreated white paper all round it being sure that even the little diamonds in the round window will tell as jewels if they are gradated justly
1188-133604-0010	But in this vignette, copied from Turner, you have the two principles brought out perfectly.
1188-133604-0011	they are beyond all other works that i know existing dependent for their effect on low subdued tones their favorite choice in time of day being either dawn or twilight and even their brightest sunsets produced chiefly out of gray paper
1188-133604-0012	it may be that a great colorist will use his utmost force of color as a singer his full power of voice but loud or low the virtue is in both cases always in refinement never in loudness
1188-133604-0013	It must, remember, be one or the other.
1188-133604-0014	Do not, therefore, think that the Gothic school is an easy one.
1188-133604-0015	the law of that school is that everything shall be seen clearly or at least only in such mist or faintness as shall be delightful and i have no doubt that the best introduction to it would be the elementary practice of painting every study on a golden ground
1188-133604-0016	this at once compels you to understand that the work is to be imaginative and decorative that it represents beautiful things in the clearest way but not under existing conditions and that in fact you are producing jeweler's work rather than pictures
1188-133604-0017	That a style is restrained or severe does not mean that it is also erroneous.
1188-133604-0018	in all early gothic art indeed you will find failure of this kind especially distortion and rigidity which are in many respects painfully to be compared with the splendid repose of classic art
1188-133604-0019	the large letter contains indeed entirely feeble and ill-drawn figures that is merely childish and failing work of an inferior hand it is not characteristic of gothic or any other school
1188-133604-0020	but observe you can only do this on one condition that of striving also to create in reality the beauty which you seek in imagination
1188-133604-0021	it will be wholly impossible for you to retain the tranquillity of temper and felicity of faith necessary for noble purist painting unless you are actively engaged in promoting the felicity and peace of practical life
1188-133604-0022	you must look at him in the face fight him conquer him with what scathe you may you need not think to keep out of the way of him
1188-133604-0023	The colorist says, first of all, as my delicious parquet was ruby, so this nasty viper shall be black. And then is the question, can I round him off, even though he is black, and make him slimy, and yet springy and close down, clotted like a pool of black blood on the earth, all the same?
1188-133604-0024	nothing will be more precious to you i think in the practical study of art than the conviction which will force itself on you more and more every hour of the way all things are bound together little and great in spirit and in matter
1188-133604-0025	You know I've just been telling you how this school of materialism and clay involved itself at last in cloud and fire.
1188-133604-0026	Here is an equally typical Greek school landscape by Wilson, lost wholly in golden mist, the trees so slightly drawn that you don't know if they are trees or towers, and no care for color whatsoever. Perfectly deceptive and marvelous effect of sunshine through the mist, Apollo and the Python.
1188-133604-0027	now here is raphael exactly between the two trees still drawn leaf by leaf wholly formal but beautiful mist coming gradually into the distance
1188-133604-0028	well then last here is turner's greek school of the highest class and you define his art absolutely as first the displaying intensely and with the sternest intellect of natural form as it is and then the envelopment of it with cloud and fire
1188-133604-0029	only there are two sorts of cloud and fire
1188-133604-0030	He knows them both.
1188-133604-0031	There's one and there's another, the Dudley and the Flint.
1188-133604-0032	it is only a pencil outline by edward burne jones in illustration of the story of psyche it is the introduction of psyche after all her troubles into heaven
1188-133604-0033	Every plant in the grass is set formally, grows perfectly, and may be realized completely.
1188-133604-0034	exquisite order and universal with eternal life and light this is the faith and effort of the schools of crystal and you may describe and complete their work quite literally by taking any verses of chaucer in his tender mood and observing how he insists on the clearness and brightness first and then on the order
1188-133604-0035	Thus, in Chaucer's dream...
1188-133604-0036	In both these high mythical subjects, the surrounding nature, though suffering, is still dignified and beautiful.
1188-133604-0037	every line in which the master traces it even where seemingly negligent is lovely and set down with a meditative calmness which makes these two etchings capable of being placed beside the most tranquil work of holbein or dure
1188-133604-0038	But now here is the subject of which you will wonder at first why Turner drew it at all.
1188-133604-0039	It has no beauty whatsoever, no specialty of picturesqueness, and all its lines are cramped and poor.
1188-133604-0040	The crampness and the poverty are all intended.
1188-133604-0041	it is a gleaner bringing down her one sheaf of corn to an old water-mill itself mossy and rent scarcely able to get its stones to turn
1188-133604-0042	The scene is absolutely Arcadian.
1188-133604-0043	See that your lives be in nothing worse than a boy's climbing for his entangled kite.
1188-133604-0044	it will be well for you if you join not with those who instead of kites fly falcons who instead of obeying the last words of the great cloud shepherd to feed his sheep live the lives how much less than vanity of the war-wolf and the gear eagle
121-121726-0000	also a popular contrivance whereby love-making may be suspended but not stopped during the picnic season
121-121726-0001	harangue the tiresome product of a tireless tongue
121-121726-0002	Angor, pain, painful to hear.
121-121726-0003	Hay fever. A heart trouble caused by falling in love with a grass widow.
121-121726-0004	Heaven, a good place to be raised to.
121-121726-0005	Hedge. Offense.
121-121726-0006	Heredity, the cause of all our faults.
121-121726-0007	Horse sense. A degree of wisdom that keeps one from betting on the races.
121-121726-0008	Hose. Man's excuse for wetting the walk.

121-123852-0003	thought kills me that i am not thought to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone but that so much of earth and water wrought i must attend time's leisure with my moan receiving nought by elements so slow but heavy tears badges of either's woe

121-127105-0000	it was this observation that drew from douglas not immediately but later in the evening a reply that had the interesting consequence to which i call attention
121-127105-0001	Someone else told a story not particularly effective, which I saw he was not following.
121-127105-0002	cried one of the women. He took no notice of her. He looked at me, but as if, instead of me, he saw what he spoke of.
121-127105-0003	There was a unanimous groan at this, and much reproach, after which, in his preoccupied way, he explained,
121-127105-0004	The story's written.
121-127105-0005	I could write to my man and enclose the key. He could send down the packet as he finds it.
121-127105-0006	The others resented postponement, but it was just his scruples that charmed me.
121-127105-0007	To this his answer was prompt, Oh, thank God, no. And is the record yours?
121-127105-0008	"'He hung fire again. "'A woman's.
121-127105-0009	She has been dead these twenty years.
121-127105-0010	She sent me the pages in question before she died.

121-127105-0012	It wasn't simply that she said so, but that I knew she hadn't. I was sure. I could see.
121-127105-0013	You'll easily judge why when you hear. Because the thing had been such a scare? He continued to fix me.
121-127105-0014	You are acute.
121-127105-0015	"'He quitted the fire and dropped back into his chair.'
121-127105-0016	Probably not till the second post.
121-127105-0017	It was almost the tone of hope. Everybody will stay.
121-127105-0018	"'cry the ladies, whose departure had been fixed.
121-127105-0019	"'Mrs. Griffin, however, expressed the need for a little more light.'
121-127105-0020	who was it she was in love with the story will tell i took upon myself to reply oh i can't wait for the story the story won't tell said douglas not in any literal vulgar way or's the pity then
121-127105-0021	"'Won't you tell, Douglas?'
121-127105-0022	Well, if I don't know who she was in love with, I know who he was.
121-127105-0023	let me say here distinctly to have done with it that this narrative from an exact transcript of my own made much later is what i shall presently give
121-127105-0024	poor douglas before his death when it was in sight committed to me the manuscript that reached him on the third of these days and that on the same spot with immense effect he began to read to our hushed little circle on the night of the fourth
121-127105-0025	the departing ladies who had said they would stay didn't of course thank heaven stay they departed in consequence of arrangements made in a rage of curiosity as they professed produced by the touches with which he had already worked us up
121-127105-0026	The first of these touches conveyed that the written statement took up the tale at a point after it had, in a manner, begun.
121-127105-0027	he had for his own town residence a big house filled with the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase but it was to his country home an old family place in essex that he wished her immediately to proceed
121-127105-0028	The awkward thing was that they had practically no other relations, and that his own affairs took up all his time.
121-127105-0029	There were plenty of people to help, but of course the young lady, who should go down as governess, would be in supreme authority.
121-127105-0030	I don't anticipate.
121-127105-0031	She was young, untried, nervous. It was a vision of serious duties and little company, of really great loneliness.
121-127105-0032	Yes, but that's just the beauty of her passion.
121-127105-0033	It was the beauty of it.
121-127105-0034	It sounded dull, but sounded strange, and all the more so because of his main condition, which was—
121-127105-0035	she promised to do this and she mentioned to me that when for a moment disburdened delighted he held her hand thanking her for the sacrifice she already felt rewarded
121-127105-0036	"'But was that all her reward?' one of the ladies asked.
1221-135766-0000	how strange it seemed to the sad woman as she watched the growth and the beauty that became every day more brilliant and the intelligence that threw its quivering sunshine over the tiny features of this child
1221-135766-0001	god as a direct consequence of the sin which man thus punished had given her a lovely child whose place was on that same dishonored bosom to connect her parent forever with the race and descent of mortals and to be finally a blessed soul in heaven
1221-135766-0002	Yet these thoughts affected Hester Prynne less with hope than apprehension.
1221-135766-0003	the child had a native grace which does not invariably co-exist with faultless beauty its attire however simple always impressed the beholder as if it were the very garb that precisely became it best
1221-135766-0004	This outward mutability indicated, and did not more than fairly express, the various properties of her inner life.
1221-135766-0005	hester could only account for the child's character and even then most vaguely and imperfectly by recalling what she herself had been during that momentous period while pearl was imbibing her soul from the spiritual world and her bodily frame from its material of earth
1221-135766-0006	They were now illuminated by the morning radiance of a young child's disposition, but, later in the day of earthly existence, might be prolific of the storm and whirlwind.
1221-135766-0007	hester prynne nevertheless the loving mother of this one child ran little risk of erring on the side of undue severity
1221-135766-0008	mindful however of her own errors and misfortunes she early sought to impose a tender but strict control over the infant immortality that was committed to her charge
1221-135766-0009	as to any other kind of discipline whether addressed to her mind or heart little pearl might or might not be within its reach in accordance with the caprice that ruled the moment
1221-135766-0010	it was a look so intelligent yet inexplicable perverse sometimes so malicious but generally accompanied by a wild flow of spirits that hester could not help questioning at such moments whether pearl was a human child
1221-135766-0011	beholding it hester was constrained to rush towards the child to pursue the little elf in the flight which she invariably began to snatch her to her bosom with a close pressure and earnest kisses not so much from overflowing love as to assure herself that pearl was flesh and blood and not utterly delusive
1221-135766-0012	brooding over all these matters the mother felt like one who has evoked a spirit but by some irregularity in the process of conjuration has failed to win the master word that should control this new and incomprehensible intelligence
1221-135766-0013	Pearl was a born outcast of the infantile world.
1221-135766-0014	Pearl saw and gazed intently, but never sought to make acquaintance.
1221-135766-0015	If spoken to, she would not speak again.
1221-135767-0000	hester prynne went one day to the mansion of governor bellingham with a pair of gloves which she had fringed and embroidered to his order and which were to be worn on some great occasion of state for though the chances of a popular election had caused this former ruler to descend a step or two from the highest rank he still held an honorable and influential place among the colonial magistracy
1221-135767-0001	another and far more important reason than the delivery of a pair of embroidered gloves impelled hester at this time to seek an interview with a personage of so much power and activity in the affairs of the settlement
1221-135767-0002	at that epoch of pristine simplicity however matters of even slighter public interest and of far less intrinsic weight than the welfare of hester and her child were strangely mixed up with the deliberations of legislators and acts of state
1221-135767-0003	the period was hardly if at all earlier than that of our story when a dispute concerning the right of property in a pig not only caused a fierce and bitter contest in the legislative body of the colony but resulted in an important modification of the framework itself of the legislature
1221-135767-0004	we have spoken of pearls rich and luxuriant beauty a beauty that shone with deep and vivid tints a bright complexion eyes possessing intensity both of depth and glow and hair already of a deep glossy brown and which in after years would be nearly akin to black
1221-135767-0005	It was the scarlet letter in another form, the scarlet letter endowed with life.
1221-135767-0006	the mother herself as if the red ignominy were so deeply scorched into her brain that all her conceptions assumed its form had carefully wrought out the similitude lavishing many hours of morbid ingenuity to create an analogy between the object of her affection and the emblem of her guilt and torture
1221-135767-0007	but in truth pearl was the one as well as the other and only in consequence of that identity had hester contrived so perfectly to represent the scarlet letter in her appearance
1221-135767-0008	"'Come, therefore, and let us fling mud at them.'
1221-135767-0009	but pearl who was a dauntless child after frowning stamping her foot and shaking her little hand with a variety of threatening gestures suddenly made a rush at the nod of her enemies and put them all to flight
1221-135767-0010	She screamed and shouted, too, with a terrific volume of sound, which doubtless caused the hearts of the fugitives to quake within them.
1221-135767-0011	it was further decorated with strange and seemingly cabalistic figures and diagrams suitable to the quaint taste of the age which had been drawn in the stucco when newly laid on and had now grown hard and durable for the admiration of after times
1221-135767-0012	they approached the door which was of an arched form and flanked on each side by a narrow tower or projection of the edifice in both of which were lattice windows the wooden shutters to close over them at need
1221-135767-0013	lifting the iron hammer that hung at the portal hester prynne gave a summons which was answered by one of the governor's bondservants a free-born englishman but now a seven years slave
1221-135767-0014	yea his honourable worship is within but he hath a godly minister or two with him and likewise a leech
1221-135767-0015	You may not see his worship now
1221-135767-0016	with many variations suggested by the nature of his building materials diversity of climate and a different mode of social life governor bellingham had planned his new habitation after the residences of gentlemen of fairest state in his native land
1221-135767-0017	on the table in token that the sentiment of old english hospitality had not been left behind stood a large pewter tankard at the bottom of which had hester or pearl peeped into it they might have seen the frothy remnant of a recent draught of ale
1221-135767-0018	little pearl who was as greatly pleased with the gleaming armor as she had been with the glittering frontispiece of the house spent some time looking into the polished mirror of the breastplate
1221-135767-0019	"'Mother!' cried she, "'I see you here. Look! look!'
1221-135767-0020	In truth, she seemed absolutely hidden behind it.
1221-135767-0021	pearl accordingly ran to the bow window at the further end of the hall and looked along the vista of a garden walk carpeted with closely-shaven grass and bordered with some rude and immature attempt at shrubbery
1221-135767-0022	but the proprietor appeared already to have relinquished as hopeless the effort to perpetuate on this side of the atlantic in a hard soil and amid the close struggle for subsistence the native english taste for ornamental gardening
1221-135767-0023	there were a few rose-bushes however and a number of apple-trees probably the descendants of those planted by the reverend mr blackstone the first settler of the peninsula that half mythological personage who rides through our early annals seated on the back of a bull
1221-135767-0024	Pearl, seeing the rose bushes, began to cry for a red rose and would not be pacified.
1284-1180-0000	He wore blue silk stockings, blue knee pants with gold buckles, a blue ruffled waist, and a jacket of bright blue braided with gold.
1284-1180-0001	His hat had a peaked crown at a flat brim, and around the brim was a row of tiny golden bells that tinkled when he moved.
1284-1180-0002	Instead of shoes, the old man wore boots with turnover tops, and his blue coat had wide cuffs of gold braid.
1284-1180-0003	For a long time he had wished to explore the beautiful land of Oz in which they lived.
1284-1180-0004	When they were outside, Ung simply latched the door and started up the path.
1284-1180-0005	No one would disturb their little house, even if anyone came so far into the thick forest while they were gone.
1284-1180-0006	At the foot of the mountain that separated the country of the Munchkins from the country of the Gillikins, the path divided.
1284-1180-0007	He knew it would take them to the house of the crooked magician, whom he had never seen, but who was their nearest neighbor.
1284-1180-0008	all the morning they trudged up the mountain path and at noon unk and ojo sat on a fallen tree trunk and ate the last of the bread which the old munchkin had placed in his pocket
1284-1180-0009	Then they started on again, and two hours later came in sight of the house of Dr. Pipt.
1284-1180-0010	unc knocked at the door of the house and a chubby pleasant-faced woman dressed all in blue opened it and greeted the visitors with a smile
1284-1180-0011	"'I am, my dear, and all strangers are welcome to my home.'
1284-1180-0012	We have come from a far lonelier place than this. A lonelier place?
1284-1180-0013	"'And you must be Ojo the Unlucky,' she added.
1284-1180-0014	Ojo had never eaten such a fine meal in all his life.
1284-1180-0015	"'We are travelling,' replied Ojo, "'and we stopped at your house just to rest and refresh ourselves.'
1284-1180-0016	The woman seemed thoughtful.
1284-1180-0017	at one end stood a great fireplace in which a blue log was blazing with a blue flame and over the fire hung four kettles in a row all bubbling and steaming at a great rate
1284-1180-0018	it takes me several years to make this magic powder but at this moment i am pleased to say it is nearly done you see i am making it for my good wife margalot who wants to use some of it for a purpose of her own
1284-1180-0019	you must know said margalot when they were all seated together on the broad window-seat that my husband foolishly gave away all the powder of life he first made to old momby the witch who used to live in the country of the gillikins to the north of here
1284-1180-0020	the first lot we tested on our glass cat which not only began to live but has lived ever since
1284-1180-0021	i think the next glass cap a magician makes will have neither brains nor heart for then it will not object to catching mice and may prove of some use to us
1284-1180-0022	I'm afraid I don't know much about the Land of Oz.
1284-1180-0023	You see, I've lived all my life with Unc Nunky, the silent one, and there was no one to tell me anything.
1284-1180-0024	"'That is one reason you are Ojo the Unlucky,' said the woman, in a sympathetic tone.
1284-1180-0025	i think i must show you my patchwork girl said margolot laughing at the boy's astonishment for she is rather difficult to explain
1284-1180-0026	but first i will tell you that for many years i have longed for a servant to help me with the housework and to cook the meals and wash the dishes
1284-1180-0027	Yet that task was not so easy as you may suppose.
1284-1180-0028	a bed quilt made of patches of different kinds and colors of cloth all neatly sewed together
1284-1180-0029	Sometimes it is called a crazy quilt, because the patches and colors are so mixed up.
1284-1180-0030	when i found it i said to myself that it would do nicely for my servant-girl for when she was brought to life she would not be proud nor haughty as the glass cat is for such a dreadful mixture of colours would discourage her from trying to be as dignified as the blue munchkins are
1284-1180-0031	At the Emerald City, where our Princess Ozma lives, green is the popular color.
1284-1180-0032	"'I will show you what a good job I did.' And she went to a tall cupboard and threw open the doors.
1284-1181-0000	Ojo examined this curious contrivance with wonder.
1284-1181-0001	margalot had first made the girl's form from the patchwork quilt and then she had dressed it with a patchwork skirt and an apron with pockets in it using the same gay material throughout
1284-1181-0002	The head of the patchwork girl was the most curious part of her.
1284-1181-0003	The hair was of brown yarn and hung down on her neck in several neat braids,
1284-1181-0004	Gold is the most common metal in the land of Oz, and is used for many purposes because it is soft and pliable.
1284-1181-0005	"'No, I forgot all about the brains,' exclaimed the woman.
1284-1181-0006	well that may be true agreed margolot but on the contrary a servant with too much brains is sure to become independent and high and mighty and feel above her work
1284-1181-0007	She poured into the dish a quantity from each of these bottles.
1284-1181-0008	"'I think that will do,' she continued, "'for the other qualities are not needed in a servant.'
1284-1181-0009	She ran to her husband's side at once and helped him lift the four kettles from the fire.
1284-1181-0010	Their contents had all boiled away, leaving in the bottom of each kettle a few grains of fine white powder.
1284-1181-0011	Very carefully the magician removed this powder, placing it all together in a golden dish, where he mixed it with a golden spoon.
1284-1181-0012	No one saw him do this for all were looking at the powder of life But soon the woman remembered what she had been doing and came back to the cupboard
1284-1181-0013	ojo became a bit uneasy at this for he had already put quite a lot of the cleverness powder in the dish but he dared not interfere and so he comforted himself with the thought that one cannot have too much cleverness
1284-1181-0014	He selected a small gold bottle with a pepper box top so that the powder might be sprinkled on any object through the small holes.
1284-1181-0015	Most people talk too much, so it is a relief to find one who talks too little.
1284-1181-0016	i am not allowed to perform magic except for my own amusement he told his visitors as he lighted a pipe with a crooked stem and began to smoke
1284-1181-0017	The Wizard of Oz, who used to be a humbug and knew no magic at all, has been taking lessons of Glinda, and I'm told he is getting to be a pretty good wizard, but he is merely the assistant of the great sorceress.
1284-1181-0018	"'It truly is,' asserted the magician.
1284-1181-0019	I now use them as ornamental statuary in my garden.
1284-1181-0020	dear me what a chatterbox you're getting to be unc remarked the magician who was pleased with the compliment
1284-1181-0021	asked the voice in scornful accents.
1284-134647-0000	The grateful applause of the clergy has consecrated the memory of a prince who indulged their passions and promoted their interest.
1284-134647-0001	the edict of milan the great charter of toleration had confirmed to each individual of the roman world the privilege of choosing and professing his own religion
1284-134647-0002	but this inestimable privilege was soon violated with the knowledge of truth the emperor imbibed the maxims of persecution and the sects which dissented from the catholic church were afflicted and oppressed by the triumph of christianity
1284-134647-0003	constantine easily believed that the heretics who presumed to dispute his opinions or to oppose his commands were guilty of the most absurd and criminal obstinacy and that a seasonable application of moderate severities might save those unhappy men from the danger of an everlasting condemnation
1284-134647-0004	Some of the penal regulations were copied from the Edicts of Diocletian, and this method of conversion was applauded by the same bishops who had felt the hand of oppression and pleaded for the rights of humanity.
1284-134647-0005	they asserted with confidence and almost with exultation that the apostolical succession was interrupted that all the bishops of europe and asia were infected by the contagion of guilt and schism and that the prerogatives of the catholic church were confined to the chosen portion of the african believers who alone had preserved inviolate the integrity of their faith and discipline
1284-134647-0006	Bishops, virgins, and even spotless infants were subjected to the disgrace of a public penance before they could be admitted to the communion of the Donatists.
1284-134647-0007	proscribed by the civil and ecclesiastical powers of the empire the donatists still maintained in some provinces particularly in numidia their superior numbers and four hundred bishops acknowledged the jurisdiction of their primate
1320-122612-0000	since the period of our tale the active spirit of the country has surrounded it with a belt of rich and thriving settlements though none but the hunter or the savage is ever known even now to penetrate its wild recesses
1320-122612-0001	the dews were suffered to exhale and the sun had dispersed the mists and was shedding a strong and clear light in the forest when the travelers resumed their journey
1320-122612-0002	After proceeding a few miles, the progress of Hawkeye, who led the advance, became more deliberate and watchful.
1320-122612-0003	he often stopped to examine the trees nor did he cross a rivulet without attentively considering the quantity the velocity and the colour of its waters
1320-122612-0004	Distrusting his own judgment, his appeals to the opinion of Chingachgook were frequent and earnest.
1320-122612-0005	Yet here are we, within a short range of the Skaroons, and not a sign of a trail have we crossed.
1320-122612-0006	Let us retrace our steps and examine as we go with keener eyes.
1320-122612-0007	Chingachgook had caught the look, and motioning with his hand, he bade him speak.
1320-122612-0008	The eyes of the whole party followed the unexpected movement and read their success in the air of triumph that the youth assumed.
1320-122612-0009	It would have been more wonderful had he spoken without a bidding.
1320-122612-0010	see said uncas pointing north and south at the evident marks of the broad trail on either side of him the dark hair has gone toward the forest
1320-122612-0011	if a rock or rivulet or a bit of earth harder than common severed the links of the clew they followed the true eye of the scout recovered them at a distance and seldom rendered the delay of a single moment necessary
1320-122612-0012	extinguished brands were lying around a spring the offals of a deer were scattered about the place and the trees bore evident marks of having been browsed by the horses
1320-122612-0013	a circle of a few hundred feet in circumference was drawn and each of the party took a segment for his portion
1320-122612-0014	The examination, however, resulted in no discovery.
1320-122612-0015	The whole party crowded to the spot where Uncas pointed out the impression of a moccasin in the moist alluvion.
1320-122612-0016	run back uncas and bring me the size of the singer's foot
1320-122617-0000	Notwithstanding the high resolution of Hawkeye, he fully comprehended all the difficulties and danger he was about to incur.
1320-122617-0001	in his return to the camp his acute and practised intellects were intently engaged in devising means to counteract a watchfulness and suspicion on the part of his enemies that he knew were in no degree inferior to his own
1320-122617-0002	in other words while he had implicit faith in the ability of balaam's ass to speak he was somewhat sceptical on the subject of a bear's singing and yet he had been assured of the latter on the testimony of his own exquisite organs
1320-122617-0003	There was something in his air and manner that betrayed to the scout the utter confusion of the state of his mind.
1320-122617-0004	the ingenious hawkeye who recalled the hasty manner in which the other had abandoned his post at the bedside of the sick woman was not without his suspicions concerning the subject of so much solemn deliberation
1320-122617-0005	The bear shook his shaggy sides, and then a well-known voice replied,
1320-122617-0006	Can these things be, returned David, breathing more freely as the truth began to dawn upon him.
1320-122617-0007	come come returned hawkeye uncasing his honest countenance the better to assure the wavering confidence of his companion you may see a skin which if it be not as white as one of the gentle ones has no tinge of red to it that the winds of the heaven and the sun have not bestowed now let us to business
1320-122617-0008	The young man is in bondage, and much I fear his death is decreed.
1320-122617-0009	I greatly mourn that one so well disposed should die in his ignorance, and I have sought a goodly hymn. Can you lead me to him?
1320-122617-0010	"'The task will not be difficult,' returned David, hesitating, "'though I greatly fear your presence would rather increase "'than mitigate his unhappy fortunes.'
1320-122617-0011	the lodge in which uncas was confined was in the very centre of the village and in a situation perhaps more difficult than any other to approach or leave without observation
1320-122617-0012	Four or five of the latter only lingered about the door of the prison of Uncas, wary but close observers of the manner of their captive.
1320-122617-0013	delivered in a strong tone of assent announced the gratification the savage would receive in witnessing such an exhibition of weakness in an enemy so long hated and so much feared
1320-122617-0014	They drew back a little from the entrance, and motioned to the supposed conjurer to enter.
1320-122617-0015	But the bear, instead of obeying, maintained the seat it had taken and growled.
1320-122617-0016	the cunning man is afraid that his breath will blow upon his brothers and take away their courage too continued david improving the hint he received they must stand further off
1320-122617-0017	Then, as if satisfied of their safety, the scout left his position and slowly entered the place.
1320-122617-0018	it was silent and gloomy being tenanted solely by the captive and lighted by the dying embers of a fire which had been used for the purpose of cookery
1320-122617-0019	Uncas occupied a distant corner in a reclining attitude, being rigidly bound both hands and feet by strong and painful widths.
1320-122617-0020	The scout, who had left David at the door to ascertain they were not observed, thought it prudent to preserve his disguise until assured of their privacy.
1320-122617-0021	What shall we do with the mingos at the door? They count six, and this singer is as good as nothing.
1320-122617-0022	The Delawares are children of the tortoise, and they outstrip the deer.
1320-122617-0023	uncas who had already approached the door in readiness to lead the way now recoiled and placed himself once more in the bottom of the lodge
1320-122617-0024	but Hawkeye, who was too much occupied with his own thoughts to note the movement, continued speaking more to himself than to his companion.
1320-122617-0025	So, Uncus, you had better take the lead, while I will put on the skin again and trust to cunning for want of speed.
1320-122617-0026	Well, what can't be done by main courage in war must be done by circumvention.
1320-122617-0027	As soon as these dispositions were made, the scout turned to David and gave him his parting instructions.
1320-122617-0028	my pursuits are peaceful and my temper i humbly trust is greatly given to mercy and love returned david a little nettled at so direct an attack on his manhood but there are none who can say that i have ever forgotten my faith in the lord even in the greatest straits
1320-122617-0029	If you are not then knocked on the head, your being a non-composer will protect you, and you'll then have a good reason to expect to die in your bed.
1320-122617-0030	So choose for yourself to make a rush or tarry here.
1320-122617-0031	Bravely and generously has he battled in my behalf, and this and more will I dare in his service.
1320-122617-0032	keep silent as long as may be and it would be wise when you do speak to break out suddenly in one of your shoutings which will serve to remind the indians that you are not altogether as responsible as men should be
1320-122617-0033	if however they take your scalp as i trust and believe they will not depend on it uncas and i will not forget the deed but revenge it as becomes true warriors and trusty friends
1320-122617-0034	hold said david perceiving that with this assurance they were about to leave him i am an unworthy and humble follower of one who taught not the damnable principle of revenge
1320-122617-0035	then heaving a heavy sigh probably among the last he ever drew in pining for a condition he had so long abandoned he added it is what i would wish to practise myself as one without a cross of blood though it is not always easy to deal with an indian as you would with a fellow christian
1320-122617-0036	god bless you friend i do believe your scent is not greatly wrong when the matter is duly considered and keeping eternity before the eyes though much depends on the natural gifts and the force of temptation
1320-122617-0037	"'The Delaware dog,' he said, leaning forward and peering through the dim light to catch the expression of the other's features. "'Is he afraid?'
1320-122617-0038	Will the Hurons hear his groans?
1320-122617-0039	The Mohican started on his feet and shook his shaggy covering as though the animal he counterfeited was about to make some desperate effort.
1320-122617-0040	He had no occasion to delay, for at the next instant a burst of cries filled the outer air and ran along the whole extent of the village.
1320-122617-0041	Uncas cast his skin and stepped forth in his own beautiful proportions.
1580-141083-0000	i will endeavor in my statement to avoid such terms as would serve to limit the events to any particular place or give a clue as to the people concerned
1580-141083-0001	i had always known him to be restless in his manner but on this particular occasion he was in such a state of uncontrollable agitation that it was clear something very unusual had occurred
1580-141083-0002	My friend's temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of Baker Street.
1580-141083-0003	Without his scrapbooks, his chemicals, and his homely untidiness, he was an uncomfortable man.
1580-141083-0004	I had to read it over carefully, as the text must be absolutely correct.
1580-141083-0005	I was absent rather more than an hour.
1580-141083-0006	the only duplicate which existed so far as i knew was that which belonged to my servant bannister a man who has looked after my room for ten years and whose honesty is absolutely above suspicion
1580-141083-0007	The moment I looked at my table, I was aware that someone had rummaged among my papers.
1580-141083-0008	The proof was in three long slips. I had left them all together.
1580-141083-0009	"'The alternative was that someone passing "'had observed the key in the door, "'had known that I was out, "'and had entered to look at the papers.'
1580-141083-0010	"'I gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed in a chair "'while I made a most careful examination of the room.'
1580-141083-0011	A broken tip of lead was lying there also.
1580-141083-0012	Not only this, but on the table I found a small ball of black dough or clay with specks of something which looks like sawdust in it.
1580-141083-0013	"'Above all things, I desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly.'
1580-141083-0014	To the best of my belief, they were rolled up.
1580-141083-0015	Did anyone know that these proofs would be there? No one save the printer.
1580-141083-0016	"'I was in such a hurry to come to you.' "'You left your door open?'
1580-141083-0017	"'So it seems to me.'
1580-141083-0018	Now, Mr. Soames, at your disposal.
1580-141083-0019	Above were three students, one on each story.
1580-141083-0020	Then he approached it, and, standing on tiptoe with his neck craned, he looked into the room.
1580-141083-0021	There is no opening except the one pane, said our learned guide.
1580-141083-0022	"'I am afraid there are no signs here,' said he.
1580-141083-0023	One could hardly hope for any upon so dry a day.
1580-141083-0024	"'You left him in a chair, you say? Which chair?' "'By the window there.'
1580-141083-0025	The men entered and took the papers, sheet by sheet, from the central table.
1580-141083-0026	"'As a matter of fact he could not,' said Solmes, "'for I entered by the side door.'
1580-141083-0027	"'How long would it take him to do that, using every possible contraction? "'A quarter of an hour, not less.'
1580-141083-0028	Then he tossed it down and seized the next.
1580-141083-0029	he was in the midst of that when your return caused him to make a very hurried retreat very hurried since he had not time to replace the papers which would tell you that he had been there
1580-141083-0030	"'Mr. Solmes was somewhat overwhelmed by this flood of information.'
1580-141083-0031	Holmes held out a small chip with the letters NN and a space of clear wood after them. You see?
1580-141083-0032	"'Watson, I have always done you an injustice. There are others.'
1580-141083-0033	"'I was hoping that if the paper on which he wrote was thin, "'some trace of it might come through upon this polished surface. "'No, I see nothing.'
1580-141083-0034	As Holmes drew the curtain, I was aware, from some little rigidity and an alertness of his attitude, that he was prepared for an emergency.
1580-141083-0035	Holmes turned away and stooped suddenly to the floor. "'Hello! What is this?'
1580-141083-0036	Holmes held it out on his open palm in the glare of the electric light.
1580-141083-0037	"'What could he do? He caught up everything which would betray him, "'and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself.'
1580-141083-0038	I understand you to say that there are three students who use this stair and are in the habit of passing your door? Yes, there are.
1580-141083-0039	"'And they are all in for this examination?' "'Yes.'
1580-141083-0040	"'One hardly likes to throw suspicion where there are no proofs.'
1580-141083-0041	Let us hear the suspicions. I will look after the proofs.
1580-141083-0042	My scholar has been left very poor, but he is hard-working and industrious. He will do well.
1580-141083-0043	"'The top floor belongs to Miles McLaren.'
1580-141083-0044	I dare not go so far as that, but of the three he is perhaps the least unlikely.
1580-141083-0045	"'He was still suffering from this sudden disturbance "'of the quiet routine of his life.'
1580-141083-0046	But I have occasionally done the same thing at other times.
1580-141083-0047	Did you look at these papers on the table?
1580-141083-0048	"'How came you to leave the key in the door?'
1580-141083-0049	"'Anyone in the room could get out?' "'Yes, sir.'
1580-141083-0050	"'I really don't think he knew much about it, Mr. Holmes.'
1580-141083-0051	Only for a minute or so
1580-141083-0052	"'Oh, I would not venture to say, sir,
1580-141083-0053	"'You haven't seen any of them?' "'No, sir.'
1580-141084-0000	It was the Indian, whose dark silhouette appeared suddenly upon his blind.
1580-141084-0001	"'He was pacing swiftly up and down his room.'
1580-141084-0002	This set of rooms is quite the oldest in the college, and it is not unusual for visitors to go over them.
1580-141084-0003	"'No names, please,' said Holmes, as we knocked at Gilchrist's door.'
1580-141084-0004	Of course he did not realize that it was I who was knocking, but, nonetheless, his conduct was very uncourteous, and, indeed, under the circumstances, rather suspicious.
1580-141084-0005	"'That is very important,' said Holmes.
1580-141084-0006	you don't seem to realize the position.
1580-141084-0007	"'Tomorrow is the examination.'
1580-141084-0008	"'I cannot allow the examination to be held if one of the papers has been tampered with. "'The situation must be faced.'
1580-141084-0009	It is possible that I may be in a position then to indicate some course of action.
1580-141084-0010	I will take the black clay with me, also the pencil cuttings. Goodbye.
1580-141084-0011	When we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle, we again looked up at the windows.
1580-141084-0012	The foul-mouthed fellow at the top.
1580-141084-0013	"'He is the one with the worst record.'
1580-141084-0014	Why, Bannister, the servant, what's his game in the matter?
1580-141084-0015	He impressed me as being a perfectly honest man.
1580-141084-0016	"'My friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure, "'but shrugged his shoulders in half-humorous resignation.'
1580-141084-0017	"'No good, my dear Watson.'
1580-141084-0018	"'I think so.' "'You have formed a conclusion.'
1580-141084-0019	"'Yes, my dear Watson, I have solved the mystery.'
1580-141084-0020	"'Look at that!' He held out his hand.
1580-141084-0021	On the palm were three little pyramids of black, doughy clay.
1580-141084-0022	And one more this morning.
1580-141084-0023	In a few hours the examination would commence, and he was still in the dilemma between making the facts public and allowing the culprit to compete for the valuable scholarship.
1580-141084-0024	he could hardly stand still so great was his mental agitation and he ran towards holmes with two eager hands outstretched thank heaven that you have come
1580-141084-0025	"'You know him?' "'I think so.'
1580-141084-0026	If this matter is not to become public, we must give ourselves certain powers, and resolve ourselves into a small private court-martial.
1580-141084-0027	"'No, sir, certainly not.'
1580-141084-0028	There was no man, sir.
1580-141084-0029	His troubled blue eyes glanced at each of us, and finally rested with an expression of blank dismay upon Bannister in the farther corner.
1580-141084-0030	"'Just close the door,' said Holmes."
1580-141084-0031	"'We want to know, Mr. Gilchrist, how you, an honorable man, ever came to commit such an action as that of yesterday.'
1580-141084-0032	For a moment Gilchrist, with upraised hand, tried to control his writhing features.
1580-141084-0033	"'Come, come,' said Holmes kindly. "'It is human to err, and at least no one can accuse you of being a callous criminal.'
1580-141084-0034	"'Well, well, don't trouble to answer. Listen, and see that I do you no injustice.'
1580-141084-0035	he could examine the papers in his own office.
1580-141084-0036	"'The Indian I also thought nothing of.'
1580-141084-0037	When I approached your room, I examined the window.
1580-141084-0038	No one less than that would have a chance.
1580-141084-0039	I entered, and I took you into my confidence as to the suggestions of the side table.
1580-141084-0040	He returned, carrying his jumping shoes, which are provided, as you are aware, with several sharp spikes.
1580-141084-0041	No harm would have been done had it not been that as he passed your door he perceived the key which had been left by the carelessness of your servant.
1580-141084-0042	A sudden impulse came over him to enter, and see if they were indeed the proofs.
1580-141084-0043	He put his shoes on the table.
1580-141084-0044	"'Gloves,' said the young man.
1580-141084-0045	Suddenly he heard him at the very door. There was no possible escape.
1580-141084-0046	"'Have I told the truth, Mr. Gilchrist?'
1580-141084-0047	"'I have a letter here, Mr. Solmes, which I wrote to you early this morning, in the middle of a restless night.'
1580-141084-0048	"'It will be clear to you from what I have said "'that only you could have let this young man out "'since you were left in the room "'and must have locked the door when you went out.'
1580-141084-0049	"'It was simple enough, sir. "'If you only had known! "'But with all your cleverness, "'it was impossible that you could know.
1580-141084-0050	"'If Mr. Soames saw them, the game was up.'
1995-1826-0000	in the debate between the senior societies her defense of the fifteenth amendment had been not only a notable bit of reasoning but delivered with real enthusiasm
1995-1826-0001	the south she had not thought of seriously and yet knowing of its delightful hospitality and mild climate she was not averse to charleston or new orleans
1995-1826-0002	John Taylor, who had supported her through college, was interested in cotton.
1995-1826-0003	Better go, he had counseled sententiously.
1995-1826-0004	might learn something useful down there.
1995-1826-0005	But John, there's no society, just elementary work.
1995-1826-0006	Been looking up Tombs County.
1995-1826-0007	Find some Crestwells there. Big plantations, rated at $250,000.
1995-1826-0008	Some others too. Big Cotton County.
1995-1826-0009	"'You ought to know, John, if I teach Negroes, I'll scarcely see much of people in my own class.'
1995-1826-0010	At any rate, I say go.
1995-1826-0011	here she was teaching dirty children and the smell of confused odors and bodily perspiration was to her at times unbearable
1995-1826-0012	She wanted a glance of the new books and periodicals and talk of great philanthropies and reforms.
1995-1826-0013	so for the hundredth time she was thinking to-day as she walked alone up the lane back of the barn and then slowly down through the bottoms
1995-1826-0014	Cotton! She paused.
1995-1826-0015	She had almost forgotten that it was here within touch and sight.
1995-1826-0016	The glimmering sea of delicate leaves whispered and murmured before her, stretching away to the northward,
1995-1826-0017	There might be a bit of poetry here and there, but most of this place was such desperate prose.
1995-1826-0018	Her regard shifted to the green stalks and leaves again and she started to move away.
1995-1826-0019	Cotton is a wonderful thing, is it not, boys? she said rather primly.
1995-1826-0020	Miss Taylor did not know much about cotton, but at least one more remark seemed called for.
1995-1826-0021	don't know well of all things inwardly commented miss taylor literally born in cotton and oh well as much as to ask what's the use she turned again to go
1995-1826-0022	I suppose though it's too early for them. Then came the explosion.
1995-1826-0023	Goobles don't grow on the tops of vines, but on the ground, on the roots, like yams. Is that so?
1995-1826-0024	The golden fleece. It's the silver fleece. He hearkened.
1995-1826-0025	Sometime you'll tell me, please. Won't you?
1995-1826-0026	now for one little half hour she had been a woman talking to a boy no not even that she had been talking just talking there were no persons in the conversation just things one thing cotton
1995-1836-0000	The Honorable Charles Smith, Miss Sarah's brother, was walking swiftly uptown from Mr. Easterly's Wall Street office and his face was pale.
1995-1836-0001	At last the cotton combine was to all appearances an assured fact and he was slated for the Senate.
1995-1836-0002	Why should he not be as other men?
1995-1836-0003	she was not herself a notably intelligent woman she greatly admired intelligence or whatever looked to her like intelligence in others
1995-1836-0004	As she awaited her guests, she surveyed the table with both satisfaction and disquietude, for her social functions were few. Tonight there were, she checked them off on her fingers, Sir James Crichton, the rich English manufacturer, and Lady Crichton, Mr. and Mrs. Vanderpool, Mr. Harry Cresswell and his sister, John Taylor and his sister, and Mr. Charles Smith, whom the evening papers mentioned as likely to be United States Senator from New Jersey,
1995-1836-0005	mrs gray had met southerners before but not intimately and she always had in mind vividly their cruelty to poor negroes a subject she made a point of introducing forthwith
1995-1836-0006	She was therefore most agreeably surprised to hear Mr. Cresswell express himself so cordially as approving of Negro education.
1995-1836-0007	Do you believe in some education? asked Mary Taylor.
1995-1836-0008	i believe in the training of people to their highest capacity the englishman here heartily seconded him
1995-1836-0009	But, Cresswell added significantly, capacity differs enormously between races.
1995-1836-0010	the vanderpoels were sure of this and the englishman instancing india became quite eloquent mrs gray was mystified but hardly dared admit it the general trend of the conversation seemed to be that most individuals needed to be submitted to the sharpest scrutiny before being allowed much education and as for the lower races it was simply criminal to open such useless opportunities to them
1995-1836-0011	Positively heroic, added Cresswell, avoiding his sister's eyes.
1995-1836-0012	But we're not exactly welcome.
1995-1836-0013	Mary Taylor, however, related the tale of Zora to Mrs. Gray's private ear later.
1995-1836-0014	Fortunately, said Mr. Vanderpool, northerners and southerners are arriving at a better mutual understanding on most of these matters.
1995-1837-0000	He knew the silver fleece, his and Zora's, must be ruined.
1995-1837-0001	It was the first great sorrow of his life. It was not so much the loss of the cotton itself, but the fantasy, the hopes, the dreams built around it.
1995-1837-0002	Ah, the swamp, the cruel swamp.
1995-1837-0003	The revelation of his love lighted and brightened slowly till it flamed like a sunrise over him and left him in burning wonder.
1995-1837-0004	He panted to know if she too knew, or knew and cared not, or cared and knew not.
1995-1837-0005	She was so strange and human a creature.
1995-1837-0006	The world was water veiled in mists.
1995-1837-0007	Then of a sudden at midday the sun shot out, hot and still. No breath of air stirred. The sky was like blue steel. The earth steamed.
1995-1837-0008	Where was the use of imagining?
1995-1837-0009	The lagoon had been level with the dikes a week ago, and now...
1995-1837-0010	Perhaps she too might be there, waiting, weeping.
1995-1837-0011	He started at the thought. He hurried forth sadly.
1995-1837-0012	He splashed and stamped along farther and farther onward until he neared the rampart of the clearing and put foot upon the tree bridge.
1995-1837-0013	Then he looked down. The lagoon was dry.
1995-1837-0014	He stood a moment bewildered, then turned and rushed upon the island. A great sheet of dazzling sunlight swept the place, and beneath lay a mighty mass of olive green, thick, tall, wet, and willowy.
1995-1837-0015	The squares of cotton, sharp-edged, heavy, were just about to burst to bowls.
1995-1837-0016	For one long moment he paused, stupid, agape, with utter amazement, then leaned dizzily against the tree.
1995-1837-0017	He gazed about, perplexed, astonished.
1995-1837-0018	here lay the reading of the riddle with infinite work and pains some one had dug a canal from the lagoon to the creek into which the former had drained by a long and crooked way thus allowing it to empty directly
1995-1837-0019	He sat down, weak, bewildered, and one thought was uppermost. "'Zora!'
1995-1837-0020	The years of the days of her dying were ten.
1995-1837-0021	The hope and dream of harvest was upon the land.
1995-1837-0022	Up in the sick room Zora lay on the little white bed.
1995-1837-0023	the net and web of endless things had been crawling and creeping around her she had struggled in dumb speechless terror against some mighty grasping that strove for her life with gnarled and creeping fingers but now at last weakly she opened her eyes and questioned
1995-1837-0024	For a while she lay in her chair in happy, dreamy pleasure at sun and bird and tree.
1995-1837-0025	she rose with a fleeting glance gathered the shawl around her then gliding forward wavering tremulous slipped across the road and into the swamp
1995-1837-0026	She had been born within its borders, within its borders she had lived and grown, and within its borders she had met her love.
1995-1837-0027	On she hurried until sweeping down to the lagoon and the island, lo, the cotton lay before her.
1995-1837-0028	The chair was empty, but he knew.
1995-1837-0029	He darted through the trees and paused, a tall man, strongly but slimly made.
2094-142345-0000	It is a very fine old place of red brick, softened by a pale, powdery lichen, which has dispersed itself with happy irregularity, so as to bring the red brick into terms of friendly companionship with the limestone ornaments surrounding the three gables, the windows, and the door-place.
2094-142345-0001	But the windows are patched with wooden panes, and the door, I think, is like the gate. It is never opened.
2094-142345-0002	for it is a solid heavy handsome door and must once have been in the habit of shutting with a sonorous bang behind the liveried lackey who had just seen his master and mistress off the grounds in a carriage and pair
2094-142345-0003	a large open fireplace with rusty dogs in it and a bare boarded floor at the far end fleeces of wool stacked up in the middle of the floor some empty corn bags
2094-142345-0004	And what through the left-hand window?
2094-142345-0005	several clothes horses, a pillion, a spinning wheel, and an old box wide open and stuffed full of colored rags.
2094-142345-0006	at the edge of this box there lies a great wooden doll which so far as mutilation is concerned bears a strong resemblance to the finest greek sculpture and especially in the total loss of its nose
2094-142345-0007	The history of the house is plain now.
2094-142345-0008	But there is always a stronger sense of life when the sun is brilliant after rain. And now he is pouring down his beams and making sparkles among the wet straw, and lighting up every patch of vivid green moss on the red tiles of the cow shed, and turning even the muddy water that is hurrying along the channel to the drain into a mirror for the yellow-billed ducks
2094-142345-0009	for the great barn doors are thrown wide open and men are busy there mending the harness under the superintendence of mr goby the whittaw otherwise saddler who entertains them with the latest treadlestone gossip
2094-142345-0010	Hetty Searle often took the opportunity, when her aunt's back was turned, of looking at the pleasing reflection of herself in those polished services. For the oak table was usually turned up like a screen, and was more for ornament than for use. And she could see herself sometimes in the great round pewter dishes that were arranged on the shelves above the long deal dinner table, or in the hobs of the grate which always shone like jasper.
2094-142345-0011	do not suppose however that mrs poyser was elderly or shrewish in her appearance she was a good-looking woman not more than eight-and-thirty of fair complexion and sandy hair well shapen light-footed
2094-142345-0012	the family likeness between her and her niece dinah morris with the contrast between her keenness and dinah's seraphic gentleness of expression might have served a painter as an excellent suggestion for a martha and mary
2094-142345-0013	her tongue was not less keen than her eye and whenever a damsel came within earshot seemed to take up an unfinished lecture as a barrel-organ takes up a tune precisely at the point where it had left off
2094-142345-0014	the fact that it was churning day was another reason why it was inconvenient to have the widows and why consequently mrs poyser should scold molly the housemaid with unusual severity
2094-142345-0015	to all appearance molly had got through her after-dinner work in an exemplary manner had cleaned herself with great despatch and now came to ask submissively if she should sit down to her spinning till milking-time
2094-142345-0016	spinning indeed
2094-142345-0017	I never knew your equals for gallowsness.
2094-142345-0018	"'Who taught you to scrub a floor?' I should like to know.'
2094-142345-0019	"'Comb the wool for the widows, indeed.'
2094-142345-0020	That's what you'd like to be doing, is it?
2094-142345-0021	That's the way with you. That's the road you'd all like to go, headlongs to ruin.
2094-142345-0022	"'Mr. Oatley's indeed.'
2094-142345-0023	"'You are a rarin' for sitting down to your work "'a little while after it's time to put by.'
2094-142345-0024	Money? My iron's twight told. Pease put it down to warm.
2094-142345-0025	Cold is it, my darling. Bless your sweet face.
2094-142345-0026	She's going to put the ironing things away.
2094-142345-0027	Money I did like to do into the barn to Tommy to see the widowed.
2094-142345-0028	"'No, no, no. Toddy'd get her feet wet,' said Mrs. Poyser, carrying away her iron.'
2094-142345-0029	Did ever anybody see the like, screamed Mrs. Poyser, running towards the table, when her eye had fallen on the blue stream.
2094-142345-0030	toddie however had descended from her chair with great swiftness and was already in retreat towards the dairy with a sort of waddling run and an amount of fat on the nape of her neck which made her look like the metamorphosis of a white suckling pig
2094-142345-0031	"'And she was very fond of you, too, Aunt Rachel.'
2094-142345-0032	"'I often heard her talk of you in the same sort of way.'
2094-142345-0033	when she had that bad illness and i was only eleven years old she used to say you'll have a friend on earth in your aunt rachel if i'm taken from you for she has a kind heart and i'm sure i've found it so
2094-142345-0034	"'And there's linen in the house, as I could well spare you, "'for I got lots of sheeting and table-clothing and toweling as isn't made up.'
2094-142345-0035	"'But not more than what's in the Bible, and,' said Dinah.
2094-142345-0036	Nay, dear aunt, you never heard me say that all people are called to forsake their work and their families.
2094-142345-0037	we can all be servants of god wherever our lot is cast but he gives us different sorts of work according as he fits us for it and calls us to it
2094-142345-0038	i can no more help spending my life in trying to do what i can for the souls of others than you could help running if you heard little toddie crying at the other end of the house the voice would go to your heart you would think the dear child was in trouble or in danger and you couldn't rest without running to help her and comfort her
2094-142345-0039	I have strong assurance that no evil will happen to you and my uncle and the children from anything I have done.
2094-142345-0040	I didn't preach without direction.
2094-142345-0041	direction
2094-142345-0042	I had a common patience with you.
2094-142345-0043	By this time the two gentlemen had reached the palings, and had got down from their horses. It was plain they meant to come in.
2094-142345-0044	said Mr. Irwin, with his stately cordiality.
2094-142345-0045	"'Oh, sir, don't mention it,' said Mrs. Poyser.
2094-142345-0046	My delight in your kitchen.
2094-142345-0047	"'Poyser is not at home, is he?'
2094-142345-0048	said Captain Donnythorne, seating himself where he could see along the short passage to the open dairy door.
2094-142345-0049	no sir he isn't he's gone to rossiter to see mr west the factor about the wool
2094-142345-0050	But there's father in the barn, sir, if he'd be of any use.
2094-142345-0051	"'No, thank you. I'll just look at the whelps and leave a message about them with your shepherd.'
2094-142345-0052	I must come another day and see your husband. I want to have a consultation with him about horses.
2094-142345-0053	for if he's anywhere on the farm we can send for him in a minute.
2094-142345-0054	"'Oh, sir,' said Mrs. Poyser, rather alarmed. "'You wouldn't like it at all.'
2094-142345-0055	"'But you know more about that than I do, sir.'
2094-142345-0056	"'I think I should be doing you a service to turn you out of such a place.'
2094-142345-0057	"'I know his farm is in better order than any other within ten miles of us. "'And as for the kitchen,' he added, smiling, "'I don't believe there's one in the kingdom to beat it.'
2094-142345-0058	"'By the by, I've never seen your dairy. I must see your dairy, Mrs. Poyser.'
2094-142345-0059	this mrs poycer said blushing and believing that the captain was really interested in her milk-pans and would adjust his opinion of her to the appearance of her dairy
2094-142345-0060	Oh, I've no doubt. It's in capital order.
2300-131720-0000	The Paris plant, like that at the Crystal Palace, was a temporary exhibit.
2300-131720-0001	the london plant was less temporary but not permanent supplying before it was torn out no fewer than three thousand lamps in hotels churches stores and dwellings in the vicinity of holborn viaduct
2300-131720-0002	there messrs johnson and hammer put into practice many of the ideas now standard in the art and secured much useful data for the work in new york of which the story has just been told
2300-131720-0003	The dynamo-electric machine, though small, was robust, for under all the varying speeds of water power and the vicissitudes of the plant to which it belonged, it continued in active use until 1899, 17 years.
2300-131720-0004	Owing to his insistence on low pressure, direct current for use in densely populated districts as the only safe and truly universal, profitable way of delivering electrical energy to the consumers, Edison has been frequently spoken of as an opponent of the alternating current.
2300-131720-0005	Why, if we erect a station at the Falls, it is a great economy to get it up to the city.
2300-131720-0006	There seems no good reason for believing that it will change.
2300-131720-0007	broad as the prairies and free in thought as the winds that swept them he is idiosyncratically opposed to loose and wasteful methods to plans of empire that neglect the poor at the gate
2300-131720-0008	Everything he has done has been aimed at the conservation of energy, the contraction of space, the intensification of culture.
2300-131720-0009	For some years it was not found feasible to operate motors on alternating current circuits, and that reason was often urged against it seriously.
2300-131720-0010	It could not be used for electroplating or deposition, nor could it charge storage batteries, all of which are easily within the ability of the direct current.
2300-131720-0011	but when it came to be a question of lighting a scattered suburb a group of dwellings on the outskirts a remote country residence or a farmhouse the alternating current in all elements save its danger was and is ideal
2300-131720-0012	Edison was intolerant of sham and shoddy, and nothing would satisfy him that could not stand cross-examination by microscope, test tube, and galvanometer.
2300-131720-0013	unless he could secure an engine of smoother running and more exactly governed and regulated than those available for his dynamo and lamp edison realized that he would find it almost impossible to give a steady light
2300-131720-0014	Mr. Edison was a leader far ahead of the time.
2300-131720-0015	He obtained the desired speed and load with a friction brake, also regulator of speed, but waited for an indicator to verify it.
2300-131720-0016	Then again, there was no known way to lubricate an engine for continuous running. And Mr. Edison informed me that as a marine engine started before the ship left New York and continued running until it reached its home port, so an engine for his purposes must produce light at all times.
2300-131720-0017	edison had installed his historic first great central station system in new york on the multiple arc system covered by his feeder and main invention which resulted in a notable saving in the cost of conductors as against a straight two-wire system throughout of the tree kind
2300-131720-0018	He soon foresaw that still greater economy would be necessary for commercial success, not alone for the larger territory opening, but for the compact district of large cities.
2300-131720-0019	The strong position held by the Edison system under the strenuous competition that was already springing up was enormously improved by the introduction of the three-wire system and it gave an immediate impetus to incandescent lighting.
2300-131720-0020	it was specially suited for a trial plant also in the early days when a yield of six or eight lamps to the horse-power was considered subject for congratulation
2300-131720-0021	The street conductors were of the overhead pole line construction and were installed by the construction company that had been organized by Edison to build and equip central stations.
2300-131720-0022	meanwhile he had called upon me to make a report of the three wire system known in england as the hopkinson both dr john hopkinson and mr edison being independent inventors at practically the same time
2300-131720-0023	I think he was perhaps more appreciative that I was of the discipline of the Edison Construction Department, and thought it would be well for us to wait until the morning of the 4th before we started up.
2300-131720-0024	But the plant ran, and it was the first three-wire station in this country.
2300-131720-0025	They were later used as reserve machines and finally, with the engine, retired from service as part of the collection of Edisonia. But they remain in practically as good condition as when installed in 1883.
2300-131720-0026	The arc lamp, installed outside a customer's premises or in a circuit for public street lighting, burned so many hours nightly, so many nights in the month, and was paid for at that rate, subject to rebate for hours when the lamp might be out through accident.
2300-131720-0027	Edison held that the electricity sold must be measured just like gas or water, and he proceeded to develop a meter.
2300-131720-0028	there was infinite skepticism around him on the subject and while other inventors were also giving the subject their thought the public took it for granted that anything so utterly intangible as electricity that could not be seen or weighed and only gave secondary evidence of itself at the exact point of use could not be brought to accurate registration
2300-131720-0029	Hence the Edison electrolytic meter is no longer used, despite its excellent qualities.
2300-131720-0030	The principle employed in the Edison electrolytic meter is that which exemplifies the power of electricity to decompose a chemical substance.
2300-131720-0031	associated with this simple form of apparatus were various ingenious details and refinements to secure regularity of operation freedom from inaccuracy and immunity from such tampering as would permit theft of current or damage
2300-131720-0032	The standard Edison meter practice was to remove the cells once a month to the meter room of the Central Station Company for examination, another set being substituted.
2300-131720-0033	in december eighteen eighty eight mister w j jenks read an interesting paper before the american institute of electrical engineers on the six years of practical experience had up to that time with the meter then more generally in use than any other
2300-131720-0034	the others having been in operation too short a time to show definite results, although they also went quickly to a dividend basis.
2300-131720-0035	In this connection, it should be mentioned that the Association of Edison Illuminating Companies in the same year adopted resolutions unanimously to the effect that the Edison meter was accurate, and that its use was not expensive for stations above 1,000 lights, and that the best financial results were invariably secured in a station selling current by meter.
2300-131720-0036	The meter continued in general service during 1899 and probably up to the close of the century.
2300-131720-0037	He weighed and re-weighed the meter plates, and pursued every line of investigation imaginable, but all in vain.
2300-131720-0038	He felt he was up against it, and that perhaps another kind of a job would suit him better.
2300-131720-0039	The problem was solved.
2300-131720-0040	We were more interested in the technical condition of the station than in the commercial part.
2300-131720-0041	We had meters in which there were two bottles of liquid.
237-126133-0000	here she would stay comforted and soothed among the lovely plants and rich exotics rejoicing the heart of old turner the gardener who since polly's first rapturous entrance had taken her into his good graces for all time
237-126133-0001	every chance she could steal after practice hours were over and after the clamorous demands of the boys upon her time were fully satisfied was seized to fly on the wings of the wind to the flowers
237-126133-0002	then dear said mrs whitney you must be kinder to her than ever think what it would be for one of you to be away from home even among friends
237-126133-0003	Somehow, of all the days when the home feeling was the strongest, this day it seemed as if she could bear it no longer.
237-126133-0004	if she could only see Franzi for just one moment.
237-126133-0005	Oh, she's always at the piano, said Van. She must be there now, somewhere. And then somebody laughed.
237-126133-0006	At this the bundle opened suddenly, and out popped Franzi.
237-126133-0007	But Polly couldn't speak, and if Jasper hadn't caught her just in time she would have tumbled over backward from the stool, fronzy and all.
237-126133-0008	asked Franzi, with her little face close to Polly's own.
237-126133-0009	"'Now you'll stay,' cried Anne. "'Say, Polly, won't you?'
237-126133-0010	"'Oh, you are the dearest and best Mr. King I ever saw. "'But how did you make Mammy let her come?'
237-126133-0011	"'Isn't he splendid?' cried Jasper, in intense pride, swelling up. "'Father knew how to do it!'
237-126133-0012	"'There, there,' he said soothingly, patting her brown, fuzzy head.
237-126133-0013	"'I know,' gasped Polly, controlling her sobs. "'I won't. Only—I can't thank you.'
237-126133-0014	asked Franzi, in intense interest slipping down out of Polly's arms and crowding up close to Jasper's side.
237-126133-0015	"'Yes, all alone by himself,' asserted Jasper vehemently, and winking furiously to the others to stop their laughing. "'He did now truly, Francie!'
237-126133-0016	"'Oh no, Japser, I must go by my very own self.'
237-126133-0017	"'There, Jap, you've caught it!' laughed Percy, while the others screamed at the sight of Jasper's face.
237-126133-0018	"'Don't mind it, Polly,' whispered Jasper. "'Twasn't her fault.'
237-126133-0019	"'Dear me!' ejaculated the old gentleman, in the utmost amazement. "'And such a time as I've had to get her here, too!'
237-126133-0020	How did her mother ever let her go?
237-126133-0021	she asked impulsively. "'I didn't believe you could persuade her, father.'
237-126133-0022	"'I didn't have any fears if I worked it rightly,' said the old gentleman complacently.
237-126133-0023	he cried in high dudgeon, just as if he owned the whole of the peppers, and could dispose of them all to suit his fancy.
237-126133-0024	and the old gentleman was so delighted with his success that he had to burst out into a series of short happy bits of laughter that occupied quite a space of time
237-126133-0025	At last he came out of them, and wiped his face vigorously.
237-134493-0000	It is sixteen years since John Bergson died.
237-134493-0001	His wife now lies beside him, and the white shaft that marks their graves gleams across the wheat-fields.
237-134493-0002	from the norwegian graveyard one looks out over a vast checkerboard marked off in squares of wheat and corn light and dark dark and light
237-134493-0003	from the graveyard gate one can count a dozen gaily painted farmhouses the gilded weather vanes on the big red barns wink at each other across the green and brown and yellow fields
237-134493-0004	The air and the earth are curiously mated and intermingled, as if the one were the breath of the other.
237-134493-0005	he was a splendid figure of a boy tall and straight as a young pine-tree with a handsome head and stormy grey eyes deeply set under a serious brow
237-134493-0006	That's not much of a job for an athlete. Here I've been to town and back.
237-134493-0007	Alexandra lets you sleep late.
237-134493-0008	She gathered up her reins.
237-134493-0009	Please wait for me, Marie, Emil coaxed.
237-134493-0010	I never see Lou's side over here.
237-134493-0011	How brown you've got since you came home! I wish I had an athlete to mow my orchard.
237-134493-0012	I get wet to my knees when I go down to pick cherries.
237-134493-0013	Indeed, he had looked away with the purpose of not seeing it.
237-134493-0014	They think you're proud because you've been away to school or something.'
237-134493-0015	There was something individual about the great farm, a most unusual trimness and care for detail.
237-134493-0016	on either side of the road for a mile before you reached the foot of the hill stood tall osage orange hedges their glossy green marking off the yellow fields
237-134493-0017	Anyone thereabouts would have told you that this was one of the richest farms on the Divide, and that the farmer was a woman, Alexandra Bergson.
237-134493-0018	There is even a white row of beehives in the orchard under the walnut trees.
237-134500-0000	frank read english slowly and the more he read about this divorce case the angrier he grew
237-134500-0001	Marie sighed.
237-134500-0002	A brisk wind had come up and was driving puffy white clouds across the sky.
237-134500-0003	The orchard was sparkling and rippling in the sun.
237-134500-0004	That invitation decided her.
237-134500-0005	Oh, but I'm glad to get this place mowed.
237-134500-0006	Just smell the wild roses, they are always so spicy after a rain.
237-134500-0007	We never had so many of them in here before.
237-134500-0008	"'I suppose it's the wet season. "'Will you have to cut them, too?'
237-134500-0009	I suppose that's the wet season two then.
237-134500-0010	It's exciting to see everything growing so fast, and to get the grass cut.
237-134500-0011	Aren't you splashed? Look at the spider webs all over the grass.
237-134500-0012	in a few moments he heard the cherries dropping smartly into the pail and he began to swing his scythe with that long even stroke that few american boys ever learn
237-134500-0013	marie picked cherries and sang softly to herself stripping one glittering branch after another shivering when she caught a shower of raindrops on her neck and hair
237-134500-0014	and Emil mowed his way slowly down toward the cherry trees.
237-134500-0015	that summer the rains had been so many and opportune that it was almost more than shabatta and his man could do to keep up with the corn the orchard was a neglected wilderness
237-134500-0016	"'I don't know all of them, but I know Lyndon's are.'
237-134500-0017	If I feel that way, I feel that way.
237-134500-0018	he reached up among the branches and began to pick the sweet insipid fruit long ivory-colored berries tipped with faint pink like white coral that fall to the ground unheeded all summer through
237-134500-0019	"'He dropped a handful into her lap.'
237-134500-0020	"'Yes, don't you?'
237-134500-0021	"'Oh, ever so much. Only he seems kind of staid and school-teachery.'
237-134500-0022	"'When she used to tell me about him, "'I always wondered whether she wasn't a little in love with him.'
237-134500-0023	"'It would serve you all right if she walked off with Carl.'
237-134500-0024	I like to talk to Carl about New York and what a fellow can do there.
237-134500-0025	Oh, Emil?
237-134500-0026	"'Surely you are not thinking of going off there?'
237-134500-0027	Marie's face fell under his brooding gaze.
237-134500-0028	"'I'm sure Alexandra hopes you will stay on here,' she murmured.
237-134500-0029	I don't want to stand around a Magan.
237-134500-0030	I want to be doing something on my own account.
237-134500-0031	sometimes i don't want to do anything at all and sometimes i want to pull the four corners of the divide together he threw out his arm and brought it back with a jerk so like a table-cloth
237-134500-0032	I get tired of seeing men and horses going up and down, up and down.
237-134500-0033	"'I wish you weren't so restless and didn't get so worked up over things,' she said sadly.
237-134500-0034	"'Thank you,' he returned shortly.
237-134500-0035	and you never used to be cross to me.
237-134500-0036	"'I can't play with you like a little boy any more,' he said slowly. "'That's what you miss, Marie.'
237-134500-0037	But, Emil, if I understand, then all our good times are over. We can never do nice things together any more.
237-134500-0038	And anyhow, there's nothing to understand.
237-134500-0039	That won't last. It will go away, and things will be just as they used to.
237-134500-0040	I pray for you, but that's not the same as if you prayed yourself.
237-134500-0041	"'I can't pray to have the things I want,' he said slowly, "'and I won't pray not to have them, not if I'm damned for it.'
237-134500-0042	Then all our good times are over.
260-123286-0000	Saturday, August 15th. The sea unbroken all round. No land in sight.
260-123286-0001	The horizon seems extremely distant.
260-123286-0002	all my danger and sufferings were needed to strike a spark of human feeling out of him but now that i am well his nature has resumed its sway
260-123286-0003	"'You seem anxious, my uncle,' I said, seeing him continually with his glass to his eye. "'Anxious?'
260-123286-0004	One might be, with less reason than now.
260-123286-0005	I am not complaining that the rate is slow, but that the sea is so wide.
260-123286-0006	We are losing time, and the fact is, I have not come all this way to take a little sail upon a pond on a raft.
260-123286-0007	He called this sea upon and our long voyage taking a little sail.
260-123286-0008	Therefore, don't talk to me about views and prospects.
260-123286-0009	I take this as my answer, and I leave the professor to bite his lips with impatience.
260-123286-0010	Sunday, August 16th.
260-123286-0011	Nothing new, weather unchanged, the wind freshens.
260-123286-0012	But there seemed no reason to fear.
260-123286-0013	The shadow of the raft was clearly outlined upon the surface of the waves.
260-123286-0014	Truly the sea is of infinite width.
260-123286-0015	It must be as wide as the Mediterranean or the Atlantic. And why not?
260-123286-0016	These thoughts agitated me all day, and my imagination scarcely calmed down after several hours' sleep.
260-123286-0017	I shudder as I recall these monsters to my remembrance.
260-123286-0018	I saw at the Hamburg Museum the skeleton of one of these creatures, 30 feet in length.
260-123286-0019	i suppose professor leidenbrock was of my opinion too and even shared my fears for after having examined the pig his eyes traversed the ocean from side to side
260-123286-0020	Tuesday, August 18th.
260-123286-0021	During his watch, I slept.
260-123286-0022	Two hours afterwards a terrible shock awoke me.
260-123286-0023	The raft was heaved up on a watery mountain and pitched down again at a distance of twenty fathoms.
260-123286-0024	"'There's a whale! A whale!' cried the professor.
260-123286-0025	flight was out of the question now the reptiles rose they wheeled around our little raft with a rapidity greater than that of express trains
260-123286-0026	Two monsters only were creating all this commotion, and before my eyes are two reptiles of the primitive world.
260-123286-0027	I can distinguish the eye of the ichthyosaurus, glowing like a red-hot coal and as large as a man's head.
260-123286-0028	Its jaw is enormous, and according to naturalists, it is ironed with no less than 182 teeth.
260-123286-0029	Those huge creatures attacked each other with the greatest animosity.
260-123286-0030	Suddenly, the ichthyosaurus and the plesiosaurus disappear below, leaving a whirlpool eddying in the water.
260-123286-0031	As for the Ithiasaurus, has he returned to his submarine cavern?
260-123288-0000	the Roarings become lost in the distance.
260-123288-0001	The weather, if we may use the term, will change before long.
260-123288-0002	The atmosphere is charged with vapors, pervaded with the electricity generated by the evaporation of saline waters.
260-123288-0003	The electric light can scarcely penetrate through the dense curtain which is dropped over the theater on which the battle of the elements is about to be waged.
260-123288-0004	The air is heavy. The sea is calm.
260-123288-0005	from time to time a fleecy tuft of mist with yet some gleaming light left upon it drops down upon the dense floor of gray and loses itself in the opaque and impenetrable mass
260-123288-0006	The atmosphere is evidently charged and surcharged with electricity.
260-123288-0007	The wind never lulls, but to acquire increased strength, the vast bank of heavy clouds is a huge reservoir of fearful, windy gusts and rushing storms.
260-123288-0008	There's a heavy storm coming on, I cried, pointing towards the horizon.
260-123288-0009	Those clouds seemed as if they were going to crush the sea.
260-123288-0010	on the mast already i see the light play of a lament of st abel's fire the outstretched sail catches not a breath of wind and hangs like a sheet of lead
260-123288-0011	But if we have now ceased to advance, why do we yet leave that sail loose, which at the first shock of a tempest may capsize us in a moment?
260-123288-0012	That will be the safest. No, no, never.
260-123288-0013	the piled-up vapors condensed into water and the air put into violent action to supply the vacuum left by the condensation of the mist rouses itself into a whirlwind
260-123288-0014	Hans stirs, nods.
260-123288-0015	From the undersurface of the clouds there are continual emissions of lurid light. Electric matter is in continual evolution from their component molecules. The gaseous elements of the air need to be slaked with moisture for innumerable columns of water rush upwards into the air and fall back again in white foam.
260-123288-0016	I refer to the thermometer. It indicates the figure is obliterated.
260-123288-0017	Is the atmospheric conditioning, having once reached its density, to become final?
260-123288-0018	The raft bears on still to the southeast.
260-123288-0019	At noon, the violence of the storm redoubles.
260-123288-0020	Each of us is lashed to some part of the raft,
260-123288-0021	The waves rise above our heads.
260-123288-0022	They seem to be, we are lost, but I am not sure.
260-123288-0023	He nods his consent.
260-123288-0024	the fireball half of it white half azure blue and the size of a ten-inch shell moved slowly about the raft but revolving on its own axis with astonishing velocity as if whipped round by the force of the whirlwind
260-123288-0025	here it comes there it glides now it is up the ragged stump of the mast thence it lightly leaps on the provision bag descends with a light bound and just skims the powder magazine horrible
260-123288-0026	we shall be blown up but no the dazzling disk of mysterious light nimbly leaps aside it approaches hans who fixes his blue eye upon it steadily it threatens the head of my uncle who falls upon his knees with his head down to avoid it
260-123288-0027	A suffocating smell of nitrogen fills the air. It enters the throat. It fills the lungs.
260-123288-0028	We suffer stifling pains.
260-123440-0000	and how odd the directions will look.
260-123440-0001	Poor Alice.
260-123440-0002	it was the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along in a great hurry muttering to himself as he came oh the duchess the duchess
260-123440-0003	Oh, won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting!
260-123440-0004	alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking dear dear how queer everything is to-day
260-123440-0005	and yesterday things went on just as usual.
260-123440-0006	I wonder if I've been changed in the night.
260-123440-0007	I almost think I can remember feeling a little different.
260-123440-0008	I'll try if I know all the things I used to know.
260-123440-0009	I shall never get to twenty at that rate.
260-123440-0010	how cheerfully he seems to grin how neatly spread his claws and welcome little fishes in with gently smiling jaws
260-123440-0011	"'No, I've made up my mind about it. "'If I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here.'
260-123440-0012	It'll be no use. They're putting their heads down and saying come up again dear.
260-123440-0013	I am so very tired of being all alone here.
260-123440-0014	And I declare it's too bad that it is.
260-123440-0015	"'I wish I hadn't cried so much,' said Alice, as she swam about trying to find her way out.'
260-123440-0016	I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears.
260-123440-0017	That will be a queer thing, to be sure.
260-123440-0018	I am very tired of swimming about here. Oh, Mouse!
260-123440-0019	cried Alice again, for this time the mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain it must be really offended.
260-123440-0020	We won't talk about her any more if you'd rather not. We, indeed.
2830-3979-0000	We want you to help us publish some leading work of Luther's for the general American market. Will you do it?
2830-3979-0001	the condition is that i will be permitted to make luther talk american streamline him so to speak because you will never get people whether in or outside the lutheran church actually to read luther unless we make him talk as he would talk to-day to americans
2830-3979-0002	Let us begin with that, his commentary on Galatians.
2830-3979-0003	The undertaking, which seems so attractive when viewed as a literary task, proved a most difficult one, and at times became oppressive.
2830-3979-0004	It was written in Latin.
2830-3979-0005	The work had to be condensed.
2830-3979-0006	A word should now be said about the origin of Luther's commentary on Galatians.
2830-3979-0007	much later when a friend of his was preparing an edition of all his latin works he remarked to his home circle if i had my way about it they would republish only those of my books which have doctrine my galatians for instance
2830-3979-0008	In other words, these three men took down the lectures which Luther addressed to his students in the course of Galatians, and Rohrer prepared the manuscript for the printer.
2830-3979-0009	It presents, like no other of Luther's writings, the central thought of Christianity, the justification of the sinner for the sake of Christ's merits alone.
2830-3979-0010	But the essence of Luther's lectures is there.
2830-3979-0011	Luke 2
2830-3979-0012	The word of our God shall stand forever.
2830-3980-0000	In every way they sought to undermine the authority of St. Paul.
2830-3980-0001	They said to the Galatians, You have no right to think highly of Paul.
2830-3980-0002	He was the last to turn to Christ.
2830-3980-0003	Paul came later and is beneath us.
2830-3980-0004	Indeed, he persecuted the Church of Christ for a long time.
2830-3980-0005	do you suppose that god for the sake of a few lutheran heretics would disown his entire church
2830-3980-0006	Against these boasting false apostles, Paul boldly defends his apostolic authority in ministry.
2830-3980-0007	as the ambassador of a government is honoured for his office and not for his private person so the minister of christ should exalt his office in order to gain authority among men
2830-3980-0008	Paul takes pride in his ministry, not to his own praise, but to the praise of God.
2830-3980-0009	Paul, an apostle, not of men, etc.
2830-3980-0010	Either he calls ministers through the agency of men, or he calls them directly as he called the prophets and apostles.
2830-3980-0011	Paul declares that the false apostles were called or sent neither by men nor by man.
2830-3980-0012	The most they could claim is that they were sent by others.
2830-3980-0013	He mentions the apostles first because they were appointed directly by God.
2830-3980-0014	The call is not to be taken lightly.
2830-3980-0015	For a person to possess knowledge is not enough.
2830-3980-0016	It spoils one's best work.
2830-3980-0017	When I was a young man, I thought Paul was making too much of his call.
2830-3980-0018	I did not then realize the importance of the ministry.
2830-3980-0019	I knew nothing of the doctrine of faith because we were taught sophistry instead of certainty, and nobody understood spiritual boasting.
2830-3980-0020	This is no sinful pride, it is holy pride.
2830-3980-0021	and God the Father who raised him from the dead.
2830-3980-0022	The claw seemed superfluous on first sight.
2830-3980-0023	These perverters of the righteousness of Christ resist the Father and the Son and the works of them both.
2830-3980-0024	In this whole epistle, Paul treats of the resurrection of Christ.
2830-3980-0025	By his resurrection, Christ won the victory over law, sin, flesh, world, devil, death, hell, and every evil.
2830-3980-0026	Verse 2
2830-3980-0027	and all the brethren which are with me.
2830-3980-0028	This should go far in shutting the mouths of the false apostles.
2830-3980-0029	although the brethren with me are not apostles like myself yet they are all of one mind with me think write and teach as i do
2830-3980-0030	They do not go where the enemies of the gospel predominate. They go where the Christians are.
2830-3980-0031	Why do they not invade the Catholic provinces and preach their doctrine to godless princes, bishops, and doctors, as we have done by the help of God?
2830-3980-0032	We look for that reward which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath entered into the heart of man.
2830-3980-0033	Not all the Galatians had become perverted.
2830-3980-0034	These means cannot be contaminated.
2830-3980-0035	They remain divine regardless of men's opinion.
2830-3980-0036	Wherever the means of grace are found, there is the Holy Church, even though Antichrist reigns there.
2830-3980-0037	So much for the title of the epistle. Now follows the greeting of the apostle. Verse 3.
2830-3980-0038	Grace be to you and peace from God the Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ.
2830-3980-0039	The terms of grace and peace are common terms with Paul, and are now pretty well understood.
2830-3980-0040	The greeting of the Apostle is refreshing.
2830-3980-0041	Grace involves the remission of sins, peace, and a happy conscience.
2830-3980-0042	The world brands this a pernicious doctrine.
2830-3980-0043	Experience proves this.
2830-3980-0044	However, the grace and peace of God will.
2830-3980-0045	Men should not speculate about the nature of God.
2830-3980-0046	Was it not enough to save from God the Father?
2830-3980-0047	To do so is to lose God altogether because God becomes intolerable when we seek to measure and to comprehend his infinite majesty.
2830-3980-0048	He came down to earth, lived among men, suffered, was crucified, and then He died, standing clearly before us, so that our hearts and eyes may fasten upon Him.
2830-3980-0049	embrace him and forget about the nature of God.
2830-3980-0050	did not christ himself say i am the way and the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
2830-3980-0051	When you argue about the nature of God apart from the question of justification, you may be as profound as you like,
2830-3980-0052	We are to hear Christ who has been appointed by the Father as our divine teacher.
2830-3980-0053	At the same time, Paul confirms our creed that Christ is very God.
2830-3980-0054	that christ is very god is apparent in that paul ascribes to him divine powers equally with the father as for instance the power to dispense grace and peace
2830-3980-0055	To bestow peace and grace lies in the province of God, who alone can create these blessings. The angels cannot.
2830-3980-0056	Otherwise, Paul should have written, Grace from God the Father and peace from our Lord Jesus Christ.
2830-3980-0057	the arians took christ for a noble and perfect creature superior even to the angels because by him god created heaven and earth
2830-3980-0058	Muhammad also speaks highly of Christ.
2830-3980-0059	Paul sticks to his theme.
2830-3980-0060	He never loses sight of the purpose of his epistle.
2830-3980-0061	Not gold or silver or paschal lambs or an angel, but himself. What for?
2830-3980-0062	Not for a crown, or a kingdom, or our goodness, but for our sins.
2830-3980-0063	Underscore these words, for they are full of comfort for sore consciences.
2830-3980-0064	How may we obtain remission of our sins?
2830-3980-0065	Paul answers,
2830-3980-0066	Since Christ was given for our sins, it stands to reason that they cannot be put away by our own efforts.
2830-3980-0067	this sentence also defines our sins as great so great in fact that the whole world could not make amends for a single sin
2830-3980-0068	The greatness of the ransom, Christ, the Son of God, indicates this.
2830-3980-0069	The vicious character of sin is brought out by the words, Who gave himself for our sins.
2830-3980-0070	But we are careless. We make light of sin.
2830-3980-0071	We think that by some little work or merit we can dismiss sin.
2830-3980-0072	This passage, then, bears out the fact that all men are sold under sin.
2830-3980-0073	this attitude springs from a false conception of sin the conception that sin is a small matter easily taken care of by good works that we must present ourselves unto god with a good conscience that we must feel no sin before we may feel that christ was given for our sins
2830-3980-0074	This attitude is universal and particularly developed in those who consider themselves better than others.
2830-3980-0075	But the real significance and comfort of the words, for our sins, is lost upon them.
2830-3980-0076	On the other hand, we are not to regard them as so terrible that we must despair.
2961-960-0000	he passes abruptly from persons to ideas and numbers and from ideas and numbers to persons from the heavens to man from astronomy to physiology he confuses or rather does not distinguish subject and object first and final causes and is dreaming of geometrical figures lost in a flux of sense
2961-960-0001	the influence which the timaeus has exercised upon posterity is due partly to a misunderstanding
2961-960-0002	in the supposed depths of this dialogue the neo-platinists found hidden meanings and connections with the jewish and christian scriptures and out of them they elicited doctrines quite at variance with the spirit of plato
2961-960-0003	they were absorbed in his theology and were under the dominion of his name while that which was truly great and truly characteristic in him his effort to realize and connect abstractions was not understood by them at all
2961-960-0004	There is no danger of the modern commentators on the Timaeus falling into the absurdities of the Neoplatonists.
2961-960-0005	in the present day we are well aware that an ancient philosopher is to be interpreted from himself and by the contemporary history of thought
2961-960-0006	the fancies of the neoplatonists are only interesting to us because they exhibit a phase of the human mind which prevailed widely in the first centuries of the christian era and is not wholly extinct in our own day
2961-960-0007	but they have nothing to do with the interpretation of plato and in spirit they are opposed to him
2961-960-0008	we do not know how plato would have arranged his own dialogues or whether the thought of arranging any of them besides the two trilogies which he has expressly connected was ever present to his mind
2961-960-0009	the dialogue is primarily concerned with the animal creation including under this term the heavenly bodies and with man only as one among the animals
2961-960-0010	but he has not as yet defined this intermediate territory which lies somewhere between medicine and mathematics and he would have felt that there was as great an impiety in ranking theories of physics first in the order of knowledge as in placing the body before the soul
2961-960-0011	with heraclitus he acknowledges the perpetual flux like anaxagoras he asserts the predominance of mind although admitting an element of necessity which reason is incapable of subduing like the pythagoreans he supposes the mystery of the world to be contained in number
2961-960-0012	Many, if not all, the elements of the pre-Socratic philosophy are included in the Timaeus.
2961-960-0013	it is probable that the relation of the ideas to god or of god to the world was differently conceived by him at different times of his life
2961-960-0014	The ideas also remain, but they have become types in nature, forms of men, animals, birds, fishes.
2961-960-0015	The style and plan of the Timaeus differ greatly from that of any other of the Platonic dialogues.
2961-960-0016	But Plato has not the same mastery over his instrument which he exhibits in the Phaedrus or Symposium.
2961-960-0017	nothing can exceed the beauty or art of the introduction in which he is using words after his accustomed manner
2961-960-0018	but in the rest of the work the power of language seems to fail him and the dramatic form is wholly given up
2961-960-0019	he could write in one style but not in another and the greek language had not as yet been fashioned by any poet or philosopher to describe physical phenomena
2961-960-0020	and hence we find the same sort of clumsiness in the timaeus of plato which characterizes the philosophical poem of lucretius
2961-960-0021	there is a want of flow and often a defect of rhythm the meaning is sometimes obscure and there is a greater use of apposition and more of repetition than occurs in plato's earlier writings
2961-960-0022	Plato had not the command of his materials, which would have enabled him to produce a perfect work of art.
2961-961-0000	Socrates begins the Timaeus with a summary of the Republic.
2961-961-0001	and now he desires to see the ideal state set in motion he would like to know how she behaved in some great struggle
2961-961-0002	and therefore to you i turn timaeus citizen of locris who are at once a philosopher and a statesman and to you critias whom all athenians know to be similarly accomplished and to hermocrates who is also fitted by nature and education to share in our discourse
2961-961-0003	"'I will, if Timaeus approves.' "'I approve.'
2961-961-0004	listen then socrates to a tale of solans who being the friend of tropidas my great-grandfather told it to my grandfather critias and he told me
2961-961-0005	Some poems of Solon were recited by the boys.
2961-961-0006	and what was the subject of the poem said the person who made the remark
2961-961-0007	the subject was a very noble one he described the most famous action in which the athenian people were ever engaged
2961-961-0008	but the memory of their exploits had passed away owing to the lapse of time and the extinction of the actors
2961-961-0009	"'Tell us,' said the other, "'the whole story, and where Solon heard the story.'
2961-961-0010	But in Egypt, the traditions of our own and other lands are by us registered forever in our temples.
2961-961-0011	the genealogies which you have recited to us out of your own annals solon are a mere children's story
2961-961-0012	for in the times before the great flood athens was the greatest and best of cities and did the noblest deeds and had the best constitution of any under the face of heaven
2961-961-0013	sullen marvelled and desired to be informed of the particulars
2961-961-0014	nine thousand years have elapsed since she founded yours and eight thousand since she founded ours as our annals record
2961-961-0015	many laws exist among us which are the counterpart of yours as they were in the olden time
2961-961-0016	i will briefly describe them to you and you shall read the account of them at your leisure in the sacred registers
2961-961-0017	observe again what care the law took in the pursuit of wisdom searching out the deep things of the world and applying them to the use of men
2961-961-0018	the most famous of them all was the overthrow of the island of atlantis
2961-961-0019	for at the peril of her own existence and when the other hellenes had deserted her she repelled the invader and of her own accord gave liberty to all the nations within the pillars
2961-961-0020	This is the explanation of the shallows which are found in that part of the Atlantic Ocean.
2961-961-0021	But I would not speak at the time, because I wanted to refresh my memory.
2961-961-0022	then now let me explain to you the order of our entertainment first timaeus who is a natural philosopher will speak of the origin of the world going down to the creation of men and then i shall receive the men whom he has created and some of whom will have been educated by you and introduce them to you as the lost athenian citizens of whom the egyptian records spoke
3570-5694-0000	but already at a point in economic evolution far antedating the emergence of the lady specialized consumption of goods as an evidence of pecuniary strength had begun to work out in a more or less elaborate system
3570-5694-0001	The utility of consumption as an evidence of wealth is to be classed as a derivative of growth.
3570-5694-0002	Such consumption as falls to the women is merely incidental to their work. It is a means to their continued labour, and not a consumption directed to their own comfort and fullness of life.
3570-5694-0003	With a further advance in culture, this taboo may change into simple custom of a more or less rigorous character, but whatever be the theoretical basis of the distinction which is maintained, whether it be a taboo or a larger conventionality, the features of the conventional scheme of consumption do not change easily.
3570-5694-0004	In the nature of things, luxuries and the comforts of life belong to the leisure class.
3570-5694-0005	Under the taboo, certain victuals, and more particularly, certain beverages, are strictly reserved for the use of the superior class.
3570-5694-0006	drunkenness and the other pathological consequences of the free use of stimulants therefore tend in their turn to become honorific as being a mark at the secondary move of the superior status of those who are able to afford the indulgence
3570-5694-0007	it has even happened that the name for certain diseased conditions of the body arising from such an origin has passed into everyday speech as a synonym for noble or gentle
3570-5694-0008	The consumption of luxuries, in the true sense, is a consumption directed to the comfort of the consumer himself, and is, therefore, a mark of the master.
3570-5694-0009	With many qualifications, with more qualifications as the patriarchal tradition has gradually weakened, the general rule is felt to be right and binding that women should consume only for the benefit of their masters.
3570-5694-0010	The objection of course presents itself that expenditure on women's dress and household paraphernalia is an obvious exception to this rule, but it will appear in the sequel that this exception is much more obvious than substantial.
3570-5694-0011	the custom of festive gatherings probably originated in motives of conviviality and religion these motives are also present in the later development but they do not continue to be the sole motives
3570-5694-0012	there is a more or less elaborate system of rank and grades.
3570-5694-0013	This differentiation is furthered by the inheritance of wealth and the consequent inheritance of gentility.
3570-5694-0014	many of these affiliated gentlemen of leisure are at the same time lesser men of substance in their own right so that some of them are scarcely at all others only partially to be rated as vicarious consumers
3570-5694-0015	So many of them, however, as make up the retainer and hangers-on of the patron, may be classed as vicarious consumer without qualification.
3570-5694-0016	Many of these again, and also many of the other aristocracy of less degree, have in turn attached to their persons a more or less comprehensive group of vicarious consumer in the persons of their wives and children, their servants, retainers, etc.
3570-5694-0017	The wearing of uniforms or liveries implies a considerable degree of dependence and may even be said to be a mark of servitude, real or ostensible.
3570-5694-0018	The wearers of uniforms and liveries may be roughly divided into two classes, the free and the servile, or the noble and the ignoble.
3570-5694-0019	But the general distinction is not on that account to be overlooked.
3570-5694-0020	so those offices which are by right the proper employment of the leisure class are noble such as government fighting hunting the care of arms and accoutrements and the like in short those which may be classed as ostensibly predatory employments
3570-5694-0021	Whenever, as in these cases, the menial service in question has to do directly with the primary leisure employments of fighting and hunting, it easily acquires a reflected honorific character.
3570-5694-0022	The livery becomes obnoxious to nearly all who are required to wear it.
3570-5695-0000	In a general way, though not wholly nor consistently, these two groups coincide.
3570-5695-0001	The dependent who was first delegated for these duties was the wife, or the chief wife, and, as would be expected in the later development of the institution, when the number of persons by whom these duties are customarily performed gradually narrows, the wife remains the last.
3570-5695-0002	But as we descend the social scale, the point is presently reached where the duties of vicarious leisure and consumption devolve upon the wife alone.
3570-5695-0003	In the communities of the Western culture, this point is at present found among the lower middle class.
3570-5695-0004	If beauty or comfort is achieved, and it is a more or less fortuitous circumstance if they are, they must be achieved by means and methods that commend themselves to the great economic law of wasted effort.
3570-5695-0005	the man of the household also can do something in this direction and indeed he commonly does but with a still lower descent into the levels of indigence along the margin of the slums the man and presently also the children virtually cease to consume valuable goods for appearances and the woman remains virtually the sole exponent of the household's pecuniary decency
3570-5695-0006	Very much of squalor and discomfort will be endured before the last trinket or the last pretense of pecuniary decency is put away.
3570-5695-0007	there is no class and no country that has yielded so abjectly before the pressure of physical want as to deny themselves all gratification of this higher or spiritual need
3570-5695-0008	The question is which of the two methods will most effectively reach the persons whose convictions it is desired to affect.
3570-5695-0009	Each will therefore serve about equally well during the earlier stages of social growth.
3570-5695-0010	The modern organization of industry works in the same direction also by another line.
3570-5695-0011	It is evident, therefore, that the present trend of the development is in the direction of heightening the utility of conspicuous consumption as compared with leisure.
3570-5695-0012	it is also noticeable that the serviceability of consumption as a means of repute as well as the insistence on it as an element of decency is at its best in those portions of the community where the human contact of the individual is widest and the mobility of the population is greatest
3570-5695-0013	Consumption becomes a larger element in the standard of living in the city than in the country.
3570-5695-0014	among the country population its place is to some extent taken by savings and home comforts known through the medium of neighborhood gossip sufficiently to serve the like general purpose of pecuniary repute
3570-5695-0015	The result is a great mobility of the labour employed in printing, perhaps greater than in any other equally well-defined and considerable body of workmen.
3570-5696-0000	Under the simple test of effectiveness for advertising, we should expect to find leisure and the conspicuous consumption of goods dividing the field of pecuniary emulation pretty evenly between them at the outset.
3570-5696-0001	But the actual course of development has been somewhat different from this ideal scheme. Leisure held the first place at the start and came to hold a rank very much above wasteful consumption of goods, both as a direct exponent of wealth and as an element in the standard of decency during the quasi-peaceful culture.
3570-5696-0002	Are the circumstances permitting that instinct disposes men to look with favour upon productive efficiency and on whatever is of human use?
3570-5696-0003	A reconciliation between the two conflicting requirements is effected by a resort to make-believe. Many an intricate polite observances and social duties of a ceremonial nature are developed, many organizations are founded, with some specious object of amelioration embodied in their official style and title. There is much coming and going, and a deal of talk, to the end that the talkers may not have occasion to reflect on what is the effectual economic value of their traffic.
3570-5696-0004	The salient features of this development of domestic service have already been indicated.
3570-5696-0005	Throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure, whether of goods or of services or human life, runs the obvious implication that in order to effectually mend the consumer's good fame, it must be an expenditure of superfluities.
3570-5696-0006	As used in the speech of everyday life, the word carries an undertone of deprecation.
3570-5696-0007	The use of the word waste as a technical term, therefore, implies no deprecation of the motives or of the ends sought by the consumer under this canon of conspicuous waste.
3570-5696-0008	But it is on other grounds worth noting that the term waste in the language of everyday life implies deprecation of what is characterized as wasteful,
3570-5696-0009	in strict accuracy nothing should be included under the head of conspicuous waste but such expenditure as is incurred on the ground of an invidious pecuniary comparison
3570-5696-0010	An article may be useful and wasteful both, and its utility to the consumer may be made up of use and waste in the most varying proportions.
3575-170457-0000	And often has my mother said, while on her lap I laid my head, she feared for time I was not made, but for eternity.
3575-170457-0001	Why are we to be denied each other's society?
3575-170457-0002	Why are we to be divided?
3575-170457-0003	Surely it must be because we are in danger of loving each other too well, of losing sight of the Creator and idolatry of the creature.
3575-170457-0004	We used to dispute about politics and religion.
3575-170457-0005	She, a Torian clergyman's daughter, was always in a minority of one in our house of violent dissent and radicalism.
3575-170457-0006	Her feeble health gave her her yielding manner, for she could never oppose anyone without gathering up all her strength for the struggle.
3575-170457-0007	"'He spoke French perfectly, I've been told, when need was, "'but delighted usually in talking the broadest Yorkshire.'
3575-170457-0008	and so life and death have dispersed the circle of violent radicals and dissenters into which twenty years ago the little quiet resolute clergyman's daughter was received and by whom she was truly loved and honoured
3575-170457-0009	January and February of 1837 had passed away and still there was no reply from the southey.
3575-170457-0010	I am not depreciating it when I say that in these times it is not rare.
3575-170457-0011	But it is not with a view to distinction that you should cultivate this talent, if you consult your own happiness.
3575-170457-0012	You will say that a woman has no need of such a caution. There can be no peril in it for her.
3575-170457-0013	The more she is engaged in her proper duties, the less leisure will she have for it, even as an accomplishment and a recreation.
3575-170457-0014	To those duties you have not yet been called, and when you are, you will be less eager for celebrity.
3575-170457-0015	but do not suppose that i disparage the gift which you possess nor that i would discourage you from exercising it i only exhort you so to think of it and so to use it as to render it conducive to your own permanent good
3575-170457-0016	Farewell, madame.
3575-170457-0017	Though I may be but an ungracious advisor, you will allow me, therefore, to subscribe myself with the best wishes for your happiness, here and hereafter, your true friend, Robert Southey.
3575-170457-0018	Sir, March 16th.
3575-170457-0019	I have not ventured to hope for such a reply, so considerate in its tone, so noble in its spirit.
3575-170457-0020	I know the first letter I wrote to you is all senseless trash from beginning to end, but I am not altogether the idle dreaming being it would seem to denote.
3575-170457-0021	I thought it therefore my duty when I left school to become a governess.
3575-170457-0022	In the evenings I confess, I do think, but I never trouble anyone else with my thoughts.
3575-170457-0023	I carefully avoid any appearance of preoccupation and eccentricity, which might lead those I live amongst to suspect the nature of my pursuits.
3575-170457-0024	I don't always succeed, for sometimes when I'm teaching or sewing, I would rather be reading or writing, but I tried to deny myself, and my father's approbation amply rewarded me for the privation.
3575-170457-0025	Again, I thank you. This incident, I suppose, will be renewed no more. If I live to be an old woman, I shall remember it thirty years hence as a bright dream.
3575-170457-0026	P.S. Pray, sir, excuse me for writing to you a second time. I could not help writing, partly to tell you how thankful I am for your kindness, and partly to let you know that your advice shall not be wasted, however sorrowfully and reluctantly it may be at first followed. C.B.
3575-170457-0027	I cannot deny myself the gratification of inserting Sothe's reply.
3575-170457-0028	Keswick, March 22, 1837. Dear Madame,
3575-170457-0029	Your letter has given me great pleasure, and I should not forgive myself if I did not tell you so.
3575-170457-0030	of this second letter also she spoke and told me that it contained an invitation for her to go and see the poet if ever she visited the lakes
3575-170457-0031	On August 27, 1837, she writes,
3575-170457-0032	Come, come, I'm getting really tired of your absence.
3575-170457-0033	Saturday after Saturday comes around and I can have no hope of hearing your knock at the door and then being told that Miss E has come. Oh dear!
3575-170457-0034	In this monotonous life of mine, that was a pleasant event.
3575-170457-0035	I wish it would recur again, but it will take two or three interviews before the stiffness, the estrangement of this long separation will wear away.
3575-170457-0036	my eyes fill with tears when i contrast the bliss of such a state brightened by hopes of the future with the melancholy state i now live in uncertain that i ever felt true contrition wandering in thought and deed longing for holiness which i shall never never obtain smitten at times to the heart with the conviction that ghastly calvinistic doctrines are true darkened in short by the very shadows of spiritual death
3575-170457-0037	if christian perfection be necessary to salvation i shall never be saved my heart is a very hot bed for sinful thoughts and when i decide on an action i scarcely remember to look to my redeemer for a direction
3575-170457-0038	And meantime, I know the greatness of Jehovah. I acknowledge the perfection of His word. I adore the purity of the Christian faith. My theory is right, my practice horribly wrong.
3575-170457-0039	the christmas holidays came and she and anne returned to the parsonage and to that happy home circle in which alone their natures expanded amongst all other people they shrivelled up more or less
3575-170457-0040	Indeed, there were only one or two strangers who could be admitted among the sisters without producing the same result.
3575-170457-0041	she was gone out into the village on some errand when as she was descending the steep street her foot slipped on the ice and she fell it was dark and no one saw her mischance till after a time her groans attracted the attention of a passer-by
3575-170457-0042	unfortunately the fracture could not be set till six o'clock the next morning as no surgeon was to be had before that time and she now lies at our house in a very doubtful and dangerous state
3575-170457-0043	however remembering what you told me namely that you had commended the matter to a higher decision than ours and that you were resolved to submit with resignation to that decision whatever it might be i hold it my duty to yield also and to be silent and may be all for the best
3575-170457-0044	after this disappointment i never dare reckon with certainty on the enjoyment of a pleasure again it seems as if some fatality stood between you and me
3575-170457-0045	I am not good enough for you, and you must be kept from the contamination of too intimate society.
3575-170457-0046	a good neighbour of the brontes a clever intelligent yorkshire woman who keeps a druggist's shop in hawworth from her occupation her experience in excellent sense holds the position of village doctress and nurse and as such has been a friend in many a time of trial and sickness and death in the household round told me a characteristic little incident connected with tabby's fractured leg
3575-170457-0047	Tabby had lived with them for ten or twelve years and was, as Charlotte expressed it, one of the family.
3575-170457-0048	He refused at first to listen to the careful advice. It was repugnant to his liberal nature.
3575-170457-0049	This decision was communicated to the girls.
3575-170457-0050	Tabby had tended them in their childhood. They and none other should tend her in her infirmity and age.
3575-170457-0051	At tea time they were sad and silent, and the meal went away untouched by any of the three.
3575-170457-0052	She had another weight on her mind this Christmas.
3575-170457-0053	but anne had begun to suffer just before the holidays and charlotte watched over her younger sisters with the jealous vigilance of some wild creature that changes her very nature if danger threatens her young
3575-170457-0054	Stung by anxiety for this little sister, she upbraided Miss W for her fancied indifference to Anne's state of health.
3575-170457-0055	still her heart had received a shock in the perception of anne's delicacy and all these holidays she watched over her with the longing fond anxiety which is so full of sudden pangs of fear
3575-170457-0056	I doubt whether Branwell was maintaining himself at this time.
3729-6852-0000	to celebrate the arrival of her son sylvia gave a splendid supper to which she had invited all her relatives and it was a good opportunity for me to make their acquaintance
3729-6852-0001	without saying it positively she made me understand that being herself an illustrious member of the republic of letters she was well aware that she was speaking to an insect
3729-6852-0002	"'In order to please her, I spoke to her of the Abbey Conti, "'and I had occasion to quote two lines of that profound writer.'
3729-6852-0003	madame corrected me with a patronizing air for my pronunciation of the word skevra which means divided saying that it ought to be pronounced skewra and she added that i ought to be very glad to have learned so much on the first day of my arrival in paris telling me that it would be an important day in my life
3729-6852-0004	her face was an enigma for it inspired every one with the warmest sympathy and yet if you examined it attentively there was not one beautiful feature she could not be called handsome but no one could have thought her ugly
3729-6852-0005	sylvia was the adoration of france and her talent was the real support of all the comedies which the greatest authors wrote for her especially of the plays of marivaux for without her his comedies would never have gone to posterity
3729-6852-0006	sylvia did not think that her good conduct was a merit for she knew that she was virtuous only because her self-love compelled her to be so and she never exhibited any pride or assumed any superiority towards her theatrical sisters although satisfied to shine by their talent or their beauty they cared little about rendering themselves conspicuous by their virtue
3729-6852-0007	two years before her death i saw her perform the character of mary anne in the comedy of merivaux and in spite of her age and declining health the illusion was complete
3729-6852-0008	She was honorably buried in the church of Saint-Sauveur, without the slightest opposition from the venerable priest who, far from sharing the anti-Christian intolerancy of the clergy in general, said that her profession as an actress had not hindered her from being a good Christian, and that the earth was a common mother of all human beings, as Jesus Christ had been the Savior of all mankind.
3729-6852-0009	you will forgive me dear reader if i have made you attend the funeral of sylvia ten years before her death believe me i have no intention of performing a miracle you may console yourself with the idea that i shall spare you that unpleasant task when poor sylvia dies
3729-6852-0010	I never had any family.
3729-6852-0011	I had a name, I believe, in my young days, but I have forgotten it since I have been in service.
3729-6852-0012	I shall call you a spree.
3729-6852-0013	You do me a great honor.
3729-6852-0014	Here, go and get me change for a Louis. I have it, sir.
3729-6852-0015	At your service, sir.
3729-6852-0016	Madame Quinson, besides, can answer your inquiries.
3729-6852-0017	i see a quantity of chairs for hire at the rate of one sou men reading the newspaper under the shade of the trees girls and men breakfasting either alone or in company waiters who were rapidly going up and down a narrow staircase hidden under the foliage
3729-6852-0018	I sit down at a small table. A waiter comes immediately to inquire my wishes.
3729-6852-0019	I tell him to give me some coffee, if it is good.
3729-6852-0020	then turning towards me he says that i look like a foreigner and when i say that i am an italian he begins to speak to me of the court the city of the theatres and at last he offers to accompany me everywhere
3729-6852-0021	I thank him and take my leave.
3729-6852-0022	I address him in Italian, and he answers very wittily, but his way of speaking makes me smile, and I tell him why.
3729-6852-0023	My remark pleases him, but I soon prove to him that it is not the right way to speak, however perfect may have been the language of that ancient writer.
3729-6852-0024	I see a crowd in one corner of the garden, everybody standing still and looking up.
3729-6852-0025	"'Is there not a meridian everywhere?'
3729-6852-0026	Yes, but the meridian of the Palais Royal is the most exact.
3729-6852-0027	That is true Badr Dgri.
3729-6852-0028	All these honest persons are waiting their turn to get their snuff boxes filled.
3729-6852-0029	It is sold everywhere, but for the last three weeks nobody will use any snuff but that sold at the Civet Cat.
3729-6852-0030	"'Is it better than anywhere else?'
3729-6852-0031	But how did she manage to render it so fashionable?
3729-6852-0032	simply by stopping her carriage two or three times before the shop to have her snuff-box filled and by saying aloud to the young girl who handed back the box that her snuff was the very best in paris
3729-6852-0033	You are now in the only country in the world where wit can make a fortune by selling either a genuine or a false article. In the first case, it receives the welcome of intelligent and talented people. And in the second, fools are always ready to reward it, for silliness is truly a characteristic of the people here, and however wonderful it may appear, silliness is the daughter of wit.
3729-6852-0034	Let a man run, and everybody will run after him. The crowd will not stop unless the man is proved to be mad. But to prove it is indeed a difficult task, because we have a crowd of men who, mad from their birth, are still considered wise.
3729-6852-0035	"'It seems to me,' I replied, "'that such approval, such ratification of the opinion expressed by the king, "'the princes of the blood, etc., "'is rather a proof of the affection felt for them by the nation, "'for the French carry that affection to such an extent that they believe them infallible.'
3729-6852-0036	When the king comes to Paris, everybody calls out, « Vive Le Roy! »
3729-6852-0037	"'She introduced me to all her guests "'and gave me some particulars respecting every one of them.'
3729-6852-0038	"'What, sir?' I said to him. "'Am I fortunate enough to see you?'
3729-6852-0039	he himself recited the same passage in french and politely pointed out the parts in which he thought that i had improved on the original
3729-6852-0040	"'For the first day, sir, I think that what you have done gives great hopes of you, and without any doubt you will make rapid progress.'
3729-6852-0041	i believe it sir and that is what i fear therefore the principal object of my visit here is to devote myself entirely to the study of the french language
3729-6852-0042	i am a very unpleasant pupil always asking questions curious troublesome insatiable and even supposing that i could meet with the teacher i require i am afraid i am not rich enough to pay him
3729-6852-0043	I reside in the Marais Gros de Douzport.
3729-6852-0044	"'I will make you translate them into French, "'and you need not be afraid of my finding you insatiable.'
3729-6852-0045	he had a good appetite could tell a good story without laughing was celebrated for his witty repartees and his sociable manners but he spent his life at home seldom going out and seeing hardly any one because he always had a pipe in his mouth and was surrounded by at least twenty cats with which he would amuse himself all day
3729-6852-0046	his housekeeper had the management of everything she never allowed him to be in need of anything and she gave no account of his money which she kept altogether because he never asked her to render any accounts
4077-13751-0000	On the 6th of April, 1830, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was formally organized and thus took on a legal existence.
4077-13751-0001	Its origin was small, a germ, an insignificant seed, hardly to be thought of as likely to arouse opposition.
4077-13751-0002	Instead of but six regularly affiliated members, and at most two score of adherents, the organization numbers today many hundred thousand souls.
4077-13751-0003	in place of a single hamlet in the smallest corner of which the members could have congregated there now are about seventy stakes of zion and about seven hundred organized wards each ward and stake with its full complement of officers and priesthood organizations
4077-13751-0004	the practice of gathering its proselytes into one place prevents the building up and strengthening of foreign branches and inasmuch as extensive and strong organizations are seldom met with abroad very erroneous ideas exist concerning the strength of the church
4077-13751-0005	nevertheless the mustard seed among the smallest of all seeds has attained the proportions of a tree and the birds of the air are nesting in its branches the acorn is now in oak offering protection and the sweets of satisfaction to every earnest pilgrim journeying its way for truth
4077-13751-0006	their eyes were from the first turned in anticipation toward the evening sun not merely that the work of proselyting should be carried on in the west but that the headquarters of the church should be there established
4077-13751-0007	the book of mormon had taught the people the true origin and destiny of the american indians and toward this dark-skinned remnant of a once mighty people the missionaries of mormonism early turned their eyes and with their eyes went their hearts and their hopes
4077-13751-0008	It is notable that the Indian tribes have generally regarded the religion of the Latter-day Saints with favor, seeing in the Book of Mormon striking agreement with their own traditions.
4077-13751-0009	the first well-established seat of the church was in the pretty little town of kirtland ohio almost within sight of lake erie and here soon rose the first temple of modern times
4077-13751-0010	To the fervent Latter-day Saint, a temple is not simply a church building, a house for religious assembly.
4077-13751-0011	soon thousands of converts had rented or purchased homes in missouri independence jackson county being their centre but from the first they were unpopular among the missourians
4077-13751-0012	the lieutenant-governor littleburn w boggs afterward governor was a pronounced mormon hater and throughout the period of the troubles he manifested sympathy with the persecutors
4077-13751-0013	Their sufferings have never yet been fitly chronicled by human scribe.
4077-13751-0014	making their way across the river most of the refugees found shelter among the more hospitable people of clay county and afterward established themselves in caldwell county therein founding the city of far west
4077-13751-0015	a small settlement had been founded by mormon families on shoal creek and here on the thirtieth of october eighteen thirty eight a company of two hundred and forty fell upon the hapless settlers and butchered a score
4077-13751-0016	be it said to the honour of some of the officers entrusted with the terrible commission that when they learned its true significance they resigned their authority rather than have anything to do with what they designated a cold-blooded butchery
4077-13751-0017	Oh, what a record to read! What a picture to gaze upon! How awful the fact!
4077-13751-0018	american schoolboys read with emotions of horror of the albigenses driven beaten and killed with the papal legate directing the butchery and of the vaudois hunted and hounded like beasts as the effect of a royal decree and they yet shall read in the history of their own country of scenes as terrible as these in the exhibition of injustice and inhuman hate
4077-13751-0019	Who began the quarrel? Was it the Mormons?
4077-13751-0020	As a sample of the press comments against the brutality of the Missourians, I quote a paragraph from the Quincy Argus, March 16, 1839.
4077-13751-0021	it will be observed that an organized mob aided by many of the civil and military officers of missouri with governor boggs at their head have been the prominent actors in this business incited too it appears against the mormons by political hatred and by the additional motives of plunder and revenge
4077-13754-0000	The army found the people in poverty and left them in comparative wealth.
4077-13754-0001	but a word further concerning the expedition in general.
4077-13754-0002	it was through floyd's advice that buchanan ordered the military expedition to utah ostensibly to install certain federal officials and to repress an alleged infantile rebellion which in fact had never come into existence but in reality to further the interests of the secessionists
4077-13754-0003	Moreover, had the people been inclined to rebellion, what greater opportunity could they have wished?
4077-13754-0004	Already a north and a south were talked of. Why not set up also a west?
4077-13754-0005	they knew no north no south no east no west they stood positively by the constitution and would have nothing to do in the bloody strife between brothers unless indeed they were summoned by the authority to which they had already once loyally responded to furnish men and arms for the country's need
4077-13754-0006	what the latter-day saints call celestial marriage is characteristic of the church and is in very general practice but of celestial marriage plurality of wives was an incident never an essential
4077-13754-0007	we believe in a literal resurrection and an actual hereafter in which future states shall be recognized every sanctified and authorized relationship existing here on earth of parent and child brother and sister husband and wife
4077-13754-0008	it has been my privilege to tread the soil of many lands to observe the customs and study the habits of more nations than one and i have yet to find the place and meet the people where and with whom the purity of man and woman is held more precious than among the maligned mormons in the mountain valleys of the west
4077-13754-0009	At the inception of plural marriage among the Latter-day Saints, there was no law, national or state, against its practice.
4077-13754-0010	in eighteen sixty two a law was enacted with the purpose of suppressing plural marriage and as had been predicted in the national senate prior to its passage it lay for many years a dead letter
4077-13754-0011	Federal judges and United States attorneys in Utah, who were not Mormons nor lovers of Mormonism, refused to entertain complaints or prosecute cases under the law because of its manifest injustice and inadequacy.
4077-13754-0012	this meant that for an alleged misdemeanor for which congress prescribed a maximum penalty of six months imprisonment and a fine of three hundred dollars a man might be imprisoned for life i for many terms of a man's natural life did the court's power to enforce its sentences extend so far and might be fined millions of dollars
4077-13754-0013	before this travesty on the administration of law could be brought before the court of last resort and there met with the reversal and rebuke it deserved men were imprisoned under sentence of many years duration
4077-13754-0014	the people contested these measures one by one in the courts presenting in case after case the different phases of the subject and urging the unconstitutionality of the measure
4077-13754-0015	then the church was disincorporated, and its property both real and personal, confiscated and asciated to the government of the United States. And although the personal property was soon restored, real estate of great value long lay in the hands of the court's receiver, and the Mormon church had to pay the national government high rental on its own property.
4077-13754-0016	And so the story of Mormonism runs on. Its finale has not yet been written. The current press presents continuously new stages of its progress, new developments of its plan.
4446-2271-0000	Main Hall liked Alexander because he was an engineer.
4446-2271-0001	He had preconceived ideas about everything, and his idea about Americans was that they should be engineers or mechanics.
4446-2271-0002	It's tremendously well put on, too.
4446-2271-0003	It's been on only two weeks and I've been half a dozen times already.
4446-2271-0004	do you know alexander mayhall looked with perplexity up into the top of the hansom and rubbed his pink cheek with his gloved finger do you know i sometimes think of taking to criticism seriously myself
4446-2271-0005	She saves her hand, too. She's at her best in the second act.
4446-2271-0006	He's been wanting to marry Hilda these three years and more.
4446-2271-0007	She doesn't take up with anybody, you know.
4446-2271-0008	Irene Burgoyne, one of her family, told me in confidence that there was a romance somewhere back in the beginning.
4446-2271-0009	"'Main hall vouched for her constancy "'with a loftiness that made Alexander smile, "'even while a kind of rapid excitement "'was tingling through him.'
4446-2271-0010	He's another who's awfully keen about her. Let me introduce you.
4446-2271-0011	Sir Harry Towne, Mr. Bartley Alexander, the American Engineer.
4446-2271-0012	"'I say, Sir Harry, the little girl's going famously tonight, isn't she?'
4446-2271-0013	You know, I thought the dance a bit conscious tonight, for the first time.
4446-2271-0014	Westmere and I were back after the first act, and we thought she seemed quite uncertain of herself.
4446-2271-0015	a little attack of nerves, possibly.
4446-2271-0016	he was beginning to feel a keen interest in the slender barefoot donkey girl who slipped in and out of the play singing like some one winding through a hilly field
4446-2271-0017	one night when he and winifred were sitting together on the bridge he told her that things had happened while he was studying abroad that he was sorry for one thing in particular and he asked her whether she thought she ought to know about them
4446-2271-0018	She considered for a moment and then said, no, I think not, though I am glad you asked me.
4446-2271-0019	After that, it was easy to forget, actually to forget.
4446-2271-0020	Of course, he reflected, she always had that combination of something homely and sensible, and something utterly wild and daft.
4446-2271-0021	"'She must care about the theatre a great deal more than she used to.'
4446-2271-0022	I'm glad she's held her own since.
4446-2271-0023	After all, we were awfully young.
4446-2271-0024	I shouldn't wonder if she could laugh about it with me now.
4446-2273-0000	"'Hilda was very nice to him, and he sat on the edge of his chair, "'flushed with his conversational efforts "'and moving his chin about nervously over his high collar.'
4446-2273-0001	They asked him to come to see them in Chelsea, and they spoke very tenderly of Hilda.
4446-2273-0002	"'Lamb wouldn't care a great deal about many of them, I fancy.'
4446-2273-0003	When Bartley arrived at Bedford Square on Sunday evening, Marie, the pretty little French girl, met him at the door and conducted him upstairs.
4446-2273-0004	"'I should never have asked you if Molly had been here, for I remember you don't like English cookery.'
4446-2273-0005	I haven't had a chance yet to tell you what a jolly little place I think this is.
4446-2273-0006	They are all sketches made about the Villa d'Este, you see.
4446-2273-0007	Those fellows are all very loyal, even Main Hall.
4446-2273-0008	I've managed to save something every year, and that with helping my three sisters now and then, and tiding poor Cousin Mike over bad seasons.
4446-2273-0009	"'It's not particularly rare,' she said, "'but some of it was my mother's.'
4446-2273-0010	there was watercress soup and sole and a delightful omelet stuffed with mushrooms and truffles and two small rare ducklings and artichokes and a dry yellow roan wine of which bartley had always been very fond
4446-2273-0011	There's nothing else that looks so jolly.
4446-2273-0012	"'Thank you, but I don't like it so well as this.'
4446-2273-0013	Have you been in Paris much these late years?'
4446-2273-0014	There are a few changes in the old quarter.
4446-2273-0015	Don't I, though? I'm so sorry to hear it. How did her son turn out?
4446-2273-0016	her hair is still like flax and her blue eyes are just like a baby's and she has the same three freckles on her little nose and talks about going back to urbain
4446-2273-0017	"'How jolly it was being young, Hilda!'
4446-2273-0018	"'Do you remember that first walk we took together in Paris?'
4446-2273-0019	"'Come, we'll have our coffee in the other room, and you can smoke.'
4446-2273-0020	"'I think we did,' she answered demurely.
4446-2273-0021	What she wanted from us was neither our flowers nor our francs, but just our youth.
4446-2273-0022	They were both remembering what the woman had said when she took the money. "'God give you a happy love.'
4446-2273-0023	The strange woman and her passionate sentence that rang out so sharply had frightened them both.
4446-2273-0024	Bartley started when Hilda rang the little bell beside her. "'Dear me, why did you do that?'
4446-2273-0025	"'It was very jolly,' he murmured lazily, as Marie came in to take away the coffee.
4446-2273-0026	Have I told you about my new play?
4446-2273-0027	When she finished, Alexander shook himself out of a reverie.
4446-2273-0028	Nonsense! Of course I can't really sing, except the way my mother and grandmother did before me.
4446-2273-0029	"'It's really too warm in this room to sing. Don't you feel it?'
4446-2273-0030	Alexander went over and opened the window for her.
4446-2273-0031	There, just in front,
4446-2273-0032	He stood a little behind her and tried to steady himself as he said, "'It's soft and misty. See how white the stars are.'
4446-2273-0033	For a long time neither Hilda nor Bartley spoke.
4446-2273-0034	He felt a tremor run through the slender yellow figure in front of him.
4446-2273-0035	Bartley leaned over her shoulder without touching her and whispered in her ear, "'You are giving me a chance?' "'Yes.'
4446-2273-0036	Alexander clenched the two hands at his sides.
4446-2275-0000	The stop at Queenstown, the tedious passage up the Mercy, were things that he noted dimly through his growing impatience.
4446-2275-0001	"'She blushed and smiled and fumbled his card in her confusion before she ran upstairs.'
4446-2275-0002	Alexander paced up and down the hallway, buttoning and unbuttoning his overcoat, until she returned and took him up to Hilda's living room.
4446-2275-0003	"'The room was empty when he entered.'
4446-2275-0004	Alexander did not sit down.
4446-2275-0005	I felt it in my bones when I woke this morning that something splendid was going to turn up.
4446-2275-0006	I thought it might be Sister Kate or Cousin Mike would be happening along,
4446-2275-0007	She pushed him toward the big chair by the fire and sat down on a stool at the opposite side of the hearth, her knees drawn up to her chin, laughing like a happy little girl.
4446-2275-0008	When did you come, Bartley, and how did it happen? You haven't spoken a word."
4446-2275-0009	I got in about ten minutes ago.
4446-2275-0010	Alexander leaned forward and warmed his hands before the blaze.
4446-2275-0011	Bartley bent lowered over the fire.
4446-2275-0012	She looked at his heavy shoulders and big, determined head, thrust forward like a catapult in leash.
4446-2275-0013	"'I'll do anything you wish me to, Bartley,' she said tremulously.
4446-2275-0014	I can't stand seeing you miserable.
4446-2275-0015	"'He pulled up a window as if the air were heavy.'
4446-2275-0016	Hilda watched him from the corner, trembling and scarcely breathing, dark shadows growing about her eyes. It...
4446-2275-0017	But it's worse now. It's unbearable.
4446-2275-0018	"'I get nothing but misery out of either.'
4446-2275-0019	"'The world is all there, just as it used to be, but I can't get at it any more.'
4446-2275-0020	"'It was myself I was defying, Hilda.'
4446-2275-0021	Hilda's face quivered, but she whispered, "'Yes, I think it must have been.'
4446-2275-0022	"'But why didn't you tell me when you were here in the summer?'
4446-2275-0023	Alexander groaned. I meant to, but somehow I couldn't.
4446-2275-0024	She pressed his hand gently in gratitude.
4446-2275-0025	Weren't you happy then, at all?
4446-2275-0026	She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, as if to draw in again the fragrance of those days.
4446-2275-0027	He moved uneasily and his chair creaked.
4446-2275-0028	"'Yes, yes, she hurried, pulling her hand gently away from him.
4446-2275-0029	"'Please tell me one thing, Bartley. "'At least tell me that you believe I thought I was making you happy.'
4446-2275-0030	"'Yes, Hilda, I know that,' he said simply.
4446-2275-0031	"'I understand, Bartley. I was wrong.'
4446-2275-0032	But I didn't know. You've only to tell me now.
4446-2275-0033	"'What I mean is that I want you to promise never to see me again, "'no matter how often I come, no matter how hard I beg.'
4446-2275-0034	"'Keep away if you wish. "'When have I ever followed you?'
4446-2275-0035	Alexander rose and shook himself angrily. Yes, I know I'm cowardly.
4446-2275-0036	"'He took her roughly in his arms. "'Do you know what I mean?'
4446-2275-0037	Oh, Bartley, what am I to do?
4446-2275-0038	I will ask the least imaginable, but I must have something.
4446-2275-0039	"'I must know about you.'
4446-2275-0040	"'The sight of you, Bartley, to see you living and happy and successful, "'can I never make you understand what that means to me?'
4446-2275-0041	"'You see, loving someone as I love you makes the whole world different.'
4446-2275-0042	"'And then you came back, not caring very much, "'but it made no difference.'
4446-2275-0043	"'Bartley bent over and took her in his arms, "'kissing her mouth and her wet, tired eyes.'
4446-2275-0044	"'Don't cry, don't cry,' he whispered.
4446-2275-0045	"'We've tortured each other enough for to-night.'
4507-16021-0000	Chapter 1. Origin.
4507-16021-0001	it engenders a whole world la pègre for which red theft and a hell la pègraine for which red hunger
4507-16021-0002	Thus, idleness is the mother.
4507-16021-0003	She has a son, theft, and a daughter, hunger.
4507-16021-0004	What is slang?
4507-16021-0005	We have never understood this sort of objections.
4507-16021-0006	slang is odious
4507-16021-0007	slang makes one shudder
4507-16021-0008	Who denies that? Of course it does.
4507-16021-0009	when it is a question of probing a wound a gulf a society since when has it been considered wrong to go too far to go to the bottom
4507-16021-0010	we have always thought that it was sometimes a courageous act and at least a simple and useful deed worthy of the sympathetic attention which duty accepted in fulfilled merits
4507-16021-0011	Why should one not explore everything and study everything?
4507-16021-0012	Why should one halt on the way?
4507-16021-0013	nothing is more lugubrious than the contemplation thus in its nudity in the broad light of thought of the horrible swarming of slang
4507-16021-0014	Now, when has horror ever excluded study?
4507-16021-0015	since when has malady banished medicine
4507-16021-0016	can one imagine a naturalist refusing to study the viper the bat the scorpion the centipede the tarantula and one who would cast them back into their darkness saying oh how ugly that is
4507-16021-0017	he would be like a philologist refusing to examine a fact in language a philosopher hesitating to scrutinize a fact in humanity
4507-16021-0018	What is slang, properly speaking?
4507-16021-0019	It is the language of wretchedness.
4507-16021-0020	we may be stopped the fact may be put to us in general terms which is one way of attenuating it we may be told that all trades professions it may be added all the accidents of the social hierarchy and all forms of intelligence have their own slang
4507-16021-0021	the painter who says my grinder the notary who says my skip the gutter the hairdresser who says my mealy back the cobbler who says my cub talks slang
4507-16021-0022	There is the slang of the affected lady as well as of the press-users.
4507-16021-0023	the sugar manufacturer who says loaf clarified lumps bastard common burnt this honest manufacturer talks slang
4507-16021-0024	Algebra, medicine, botany have each their slang.
4507-16021-0025	to meet the needs of this conflict wretchedness has invented a language of combat which is slang
4507-16021-0026	To keep afloat, and to rescue from oblivion, to hold above the gulf, were it but a fragment of some language which man has spoken, and which would otherwise be lost, that is to say, one of the elements, good or bad, of which civilization is composed, or by which it is complicated, to extend the records of social observation, is to serve civilization.
4507-16021-0027	Phoenician. Very good.
4507-16021-0028	Even dialect. Let that pass.
4507-16021-0029	To this we reply in one word only.
4507-16021-0030	assuredly if the tongue which a nation or a province has spoken is worthy of interest the language which has been spoken by a misery is still more worthy of attention and study
4507-16021-0031	and then we insist upon it the study of social deformities and infirmities and the task of pointing them out with a view to remedy is not a business in which choice is permitted
4507-16021-0032	he must descend with his heart full of charity and severity at the same time as a brother and as a judge to those impenetrable casemates where crawl pell-mell those who bleed and those who deal the blow those who weep and those who curse those who fast and those who devour those who endure evil and those who inflict it
4507-16021-0033	Do we really know the mountain well when we are not acquainted with the cavern?
4507-16021-0034	they constitute two different orders of facts which correspond to each other which are always interlaced and which often bring forth results
4507-16021-0035	True history being a mixture of all things, the true historian mingles in everything.
4507-16021-0036	Facts form one of these, and ideas the other.
4507-16021-0037	There it clothes itself in word masks, in metaphor rags.
4507-16021-0038	In this guise it becomes horrible.
4507-16021-0039	one perceives without understanding it a hideous murmur sounding almost like human accents but more nearly resembling a howl than an articulate word
4507-16021-0040	One thinks one hears hydras talking.
4507-16021-0041	It is unintelligible in the dark.
4507-16021-0042	it is black in misfortune it is blacker still in crime these two blacknesses amalgamated compose slang
4507-16021-0043	the earth is not devoid of resemblance to a jail
4507-16021-0044	Look closely at life.
4507-16021-0045	It is so made that everywhere we feel the sense of punishment.
4507-16021-0046	each day has its own great grief or its little care
4507-16021-0047	Yesterday you were trembling for a health that is dear to you. Today you fear for your own. Tomorrow it will be anxiety about money. The day after, tomorrow the diatribe of a slanderer. The day after that, the misfortune of some friend. Then the prevailing weather. Then something that has been broken or lost. Then a pleasure with which your conscience and your vertebral column repress.
4507-16021-0048	this without reckoning in the pains of the heart, and so it goes on.
4507-16021-0049	there is hardly one day out of a hundred which is wholly joyous and sunny
4507-16021-0050	And you belong to that small class who are happy.
4507-16021-0051	in this world's evidently the vestibule of another there are no fortunate
4507-16021-0052	The real human division is this, the luminous and the shady.
4507-16021-0053	to diminish the number of the shady to augment the number of the luminous that is the object
4507-16021-0054	That is why we cry education, science.
4507-16021-0055	To teach reading means to light the fire. Every syllable spelled out sparkles.
4507-16021-0056	however he who says light does not necessarily say joy
4507-16021-0057	People suffer in the light. Excess burns.

4970-29093-0003	the modest fellow would have liked fame thrust upon him for some worthy achievement it might be for a book or for the skilful management of some great newspaper or for some daring expedition like that of lieutenant strain or dr kane
4970-29093-0004	he was unable to decide exactly what it should be
4970-29093-0005	sometimes he thought he would like to stand in a conspicuous pulpit and humbly preach the gospel of repentance and it even crossed his mind that it would be noble to give himself to a missionary life to some benighted region where the date-palm grows and the nightingale's voice is in tune and the bulbul sings on the off nights
4970-29093-0006	law seemed to him well enough as a science but he never could discover a practical case where it appeared to him worth while to go to law and all the clients who stopped with this new clerk in the ante-room of the law office where he was writing philip invariably advised to settle no matter how but settle greatly to the disgust of his employer who knew that justice between man and man could only be attained by the recognized processes with the attendant
4970-29093-0007	it is such a noble ambition that it is a pity it has usually such a shallow foundation

4970-29093-0009	philip therefore read diligently in the astor library planned literary works that should compel attention and nursed his genius
4970-29093-0010	he had no friend wise enough to tell him to step into the dorking convention then in session make a sketch of the men and women on the platform and take it to the editor of the daily grapevine and see what he could get a line for it
4970-29093-0011	oh very well said gringo turning away with a shade of contempt you'll find if you are going into literature and newspaper work that you can't afford a conscience like that
4970-29093-0012	but philip did afford it and he wrote thanking his friends and declining because he said the political scheme would fail and ought to fail
4970-29093-0013	and he went back to his books and to his waiting for an opening large enough for his dignified entrance into the literary world
4970-29093-0014	Well, I'm going as an engineer. You could go as one.
4970-29093-0015	You can begin by carrying a rod and putting down the figures.
4970-29093-0016	No, it's not too soon.

4970-29093-0023	he well knew the perils of the frontier the savage state of society the lurking indians and the dangers of fever

4970-29095-0001	she tried this morning an air or two upon the piano sang a simple song in a sweet but slightly metallic voice and then seating herself by the open window read philip's letter

4970-29095-0003	i hope thee told the elders that father and i are responsible for the piano and that much as thee loves music thee is never in the room when it is played
4970-29095-0004	i heard father tell cousin abner that he was whipped so often for whistling when he was a boy that he was determined to have what compensation he could get now

4970-29095-0019	And then there was Broad Street.
4970-29095-0020	there certainly was no end to it and even ruth was philadelphian enough to believe that a street ought not to have any end or architectural point upon which the weary eye could rest

4970-29095-0023	i have nothing to wear replied that demure person
4970-29095-0024	it has occupied mother a long time to find at the shops the exact shade for her new bonnet
4970-29095-0025	And thee won't go? Why should I?
4970-29095-0026	if i go to meeting at all i like best to sit in the quiet old house in germantown where the windows are all open and i can see the trees and hear the stir of the leaves
4970-29095-0027	it's such a crush at the yearly meeting at arch street and then there's the row of sleek-looking young men who lie in the curbstone and stare at us as we come out
4970-29095-0028	he doesn't say but it's on the frontier and on the map everything beyond it is marked indians and desert and looks as desolate as a wednesday meeting humph it was time for him to do something
4970-29095-0029	Is he going to start a daily newspaper among the kickapoos?
4970-29095-0030	Father, these unjust to Philip! He's going into business.
4970-29095-0031	he doesn't say exactly what it is said ruth a little dubiously but it's something about land and railroads and thee knows father that fortunes are made nobody knows exactly how in a new country
4970-29095-0032	But Philip is honest, and he has talent enough, if he will stop scribbling, to make his way.
4970-29095-0033	what a box women are put into measured for it and put in young if we go anywhere it's in a box veiled and pinioned and shut in by disabilities
4970-29095-0034	Why should I rust and be stupid and sit in inaction because I am a girl?
4970-29095-0035	"'And if I had a fortune, would thee want me to lead a useless life?'
4970-29095-0036	"'Has thee consulted thy mother about a career? "'I suppose it is a career thee wants.'
4970-29095-0037	but that wise and placid woman understood the sweet rebel a great deal better than ruth understood herself
4970-29095-0038	ruth was glad to hear that philip had made a push into the world and she was sure that his talent and courage would make a way for him
4992-23283-0000	But the more forgetfulness had then prevailed the more powerful was the force of remembrance when she awoke
4992-23283-0001	Miss Milner's health is not good.
4992-23283-0002	"'said Mrs. Horton a few minutes after.'
4992-23283-0003	so there is to me added sanford with a sarcastic sneer
4992-23283-0004	and yet you must own her behavior has warranted them has it not been in this particular incoherent and unaccountable
4992-23283-0005	not that i know of not one more that i know of he replied with astonishment at what she had insinuated and yet with a perfect assurance that she was in the wrong
4992-23283-0006	"'Perhaps I am mistaken,' answered she.
4992-23283-0007	To ask any more questions of you, I believe, would be unfair.
4992-23283-0008	he seemed to wait for her reply but as she made none he proceeded
4992-23283-0009	oh my lord cried miss woodley with a most forcible accent you are the last person on earth she would pardon me for intrusting
4992-23283-0010	but in such a case miss milner's election of a husband shall not direct mine
4992-23283-0011	If she does not know how to estimate her own value, I do.
4992-23283-0012	independent of her fortune she has beauty to captivate the heart of any man and with all her follies she has a frankness in her manner an unaffected wisdom in her thoughts a vivacity in her conversation and withal a softness in her demeanor that might alone engage the affections of a man of the nicest sentiments and the strongest understanding
4992-23283-0013	my lord miss miller's taste is not a depraved one it is but too refined
4992-23283-0014	"'What can you mean by that, Miss Woodley? You talk mysteriously.'
4992-23283-0015	Is she not afraid that I will thwart her inclinations?
4992-23283-0016	Again he searched his own thoughts, nor ineffectually as before.
4992-23283-0017	miss woodley was too little versed in the subject to know this would have been not to love at all at least not to the extent of breaking through engagements and all the various obstacles that still mitigated against their union
4992-23283-0018	To relieve her from both, he laid his hand with force upon his heart and said, Do you believe me?
4992-23283-0019	i will make no unjust use of what i know he replied with firmness i believe you my lord
4992-23283-0020	i have never yet however been vanquished by them and even upon this occasion my reason shall combat them to the last and my reason shall fail me before i do wrong
4992-41797-0000	Yes, dead these four years, and a good job for her, too.
4992-41797-0001	well as i say it's an awful queer world they clap all the burglars in jail and the murderers and the wife beaters i allers thought a gentle reproof would be enough punishment for a wife beater cause he probably has a lot of provocation that nobody knows and the fire-bugs can't think of the right name something like sendieres and the breakers of the peace and what not and yet the law has nothing to say to a man like hand lord

4992-41797-0007	He gave up his position and shut the family up in that tomb of a house so he could study his books.

4992-41797-0011	whatever appealed to her sense of beauty was straightway transferred to paper or canvas
4992-41797-0012	She is wild to know how to do things.
4992-41797-0013	She makes effort after effort, trembling with eagerness, and when she fails to reproduce what she sees, she works herself into a frenzy of grief and disappointment.
4992-41797-0014	When she could not make a rabbit or a bird look real on paper, she searched in her father's books for pictures of its bones.
4992-41797-0015	cyril there must be some better way of doing i just draw the outline of an animal and then i put hairs or feathers on it they have no bodies

4992-41797-0019	Olive's mournful black eyes met Nancy's sparkling brown ones.
4992-41797-0020	Nancy's curly chestnut crop shone in the sun, and Olive's thick black plates looked blacker by contrast.
4992-41797-0021	She is wonderful, more wonderful than anybody we've ever seen anywhere, and she draws better than the teacher in Charlestown.
4992-41797-0022	She's older than I am, but so tiny and sad and shy that she seems like a child.
4992-41806-0000	natty harman tried the kitchen pump secretly several times during the evening for the water had to run uphill all the way from the well to the kitchen sink and he believed this to be a continual miracle that might give out at any moment
4992-41806-0001	To-night there was no need of extra heat, and there were great ceremonies to be observed in lighting the fires on the hearth-stones.
4992-41806-0002	they began with the one in the family sitting-room colonel wheeler ralph thurston mr and mrs bill harmon with natty and ruffus mr and mrs popham with digby and lally joy all standing in admiring groups and thrilling with delight at the order of events
4992-41806-0003	kathleen waved the torch to and fro as she recited some beautiful lines written for some such purpose as that which called them together to-night
4992-41806-0004	Burn, fire, burn, flicker, flicker, flame.
4992-41806-0005	Next came Olive's turn to help in the ceremonies.
4992-41806-0006	ralph thurston had found a line of latin for them in his beloved horace tibi splendet focus for you the hearth-fire shines
4992-41806-0007	olive had painted the motto on a long narrow panel of canvas and giving it to mr popham stood by the fireside while he deftly fitted it into the place prepared for it
4992-41806-0008	olive has another lovely gift for the yellow house said mother cary rising and to carry out the next part of the programme we shall have to go in procession upstairs to my bedroom
4992-41806-0009	exclaimed bill harmon to his wife as they went through the lighted hall
4992-41806-0010	Ain't they the greatest?
4992-41806-0011	Mother Carrie poured coffee, Nancy chocolate, and the others helped serve the sandwiches and cake, donuts and tarts.
4992-41806-0012	At that moment the gentleman entered, bearing a huge object concealed by a piece of green felt.
4992-41806-0013	Approaching the dining table, he carefully placed the article in the center and removed the cloth.
4992-41806-0014	thinks out of myself i never seen anything osh pop'n couldn't mend if he took time enough and glue enough so i carried this little feller home in a bushel basket one night last month and i've spent eleven evenings puttin him together
4992-41806-0015	mrs harmon thought he sang too much and told her husband privately that if he was a canary bird she should want to keep a table cover over his head most of the time but he was immensely popular with the rest of his audience
4992-41806-0016	the face of the mahogany shone with delight and why not when it was doing everything almost everything within the scope of a piano and yet the family had enjoyed weeks of good nourishing meals on what had been saved by its exertions
4992-41806-0017	we shut our eyes the flowers bloom on we murmur but the corn-ears fill we choose the shadow but the sun that cast it shines behind us still
5105-28233-0000	Length of service, 14 years, 3 months, and 5 days.
5105-28233-0001	He seemed born to please without being conscious of the power he possessed.
5105-28233-0002	It must be owned, and no one was more ready to confess it than himself, that his literary attainments were by no means of a high order.
5105-28233-0003	we don't spin tops is a favorite saying amongst artillery officers indicating that they do not shirk their duty by frivolous pursuits but it must be confessed that servadac being naturally idle was very much given to spinning tops
5105-28233-0004	Once, in action, he was leading a detachment of infantry through an entrenchment.
5105-28233-0005	sometimes he would wander on foot upon the sandy shore and sometimes he would enjoy a ride along the summit of the cliff altogether being in no hurry at all to bring his task to an end
5105-28233-0006	No cathedral, not even Burgos itself, could vie with the church at Montmartre.
5105-28233-0007	ben zuph's most ambitious desire was to induce the captain to go with him and end his days in his much-loved home and so incessantly were cervidac's ears besieged with descriptions of the unparalleled beauties and advantages of this eighteenth arrondissement of paris that he could scarcely hear the name of montmartre without a conscious thrill of aversion
5105-28233-0008	when a private in the eighth cavalry he had been on the point of quitting the army at twenty-eight years of age but unexpectedly he had been appointed orderly to captain
5105-28233-0009	the bond of union thus effected could never be severed and although ben zuph's achievements had fairly earned him the right of retirement he firmly declined all honors or any pension that might part him from his superior officer
5105-28233-0010	unlike his master he made no pretension to any gift of poetic power but his inexhaustible memory made him a living encyclopaedia and for his stock of anecdotes and troopers tales he was matchless
5105-28240-0000	Fast as his legs could carry him, Servadac had made his way to the top of the cliff.
5105-28240-0001	it was quite true that a vessel was in sight hardly more than six miles from the shore but owing to the increase in the earth's convexity and the consequent limitation of the range of vision the rigging of the topmasts alone was visible above the water
5105-28240-0002	exclaimed Servadak, keeping his eye unmoved at his telescope.
5105-28240-0003	"'She is under sail, but she is Count Timoshev's yacht.' He was right.
5105-28240-0004	If the Count were on board, a strange fatality was bringing him to the presence of his rival.
5105-28240-0005	"'He reckoned, therefore, not only upon ascertaining "'the extent of the late catastrophe, "'but upon learning its cause.'
5105-28240-0006	the wind being adverse the dobrina did not make very rapid progress but as the weather in spite of a few clouds remained calm and the sea was quite smooth she was enabled to hold a steady course
5105-28240-0007	Servadac took it for granted that the Dobrina was endeavoring to put in.
5105-28240-0008	a narrow channel formed a passage through the ridge of rocks that protected it from the open sea and which even in the roughest weather would insure the calmness of its waters
5105-28240-0009	slightly changing her course she first struck her mainsail and in order to facilitate the movements of her helmsman soon carried nothing but her two topsails brigantine and jib
5105-28240-0010	Captain Servadac hastened toward him.
5105-28240-0011	"'I left you on a continent, and here I have the honour of finding you on an island.'
5105-28240-0012	"'Never mind now,' interposed the captain. "'We will talk of that by and by.'
5105-28240-0013	"'Nothing more than you know yourself.'
5105-28240-0014	Are you certain that this is the Mediterranean?
5105-28240-0015	For some moments he seemed perfectly stupefied, and then recovering himself he began to overwhelm the Count with a torrent of questions.
5105-28240-0016	To all these inquiries the Count responded in the affirmative,
5105-28240-0017	Some mysterious force seemed to have brought about a convulsion of the elements.
5105-28240-0018	You will take me on board, Count, will you not?
5105-28240-0019	"'My yacht is at your service, sir, even should you require to make a tour around the world.'
5105-28240-0020	The Count shook his head.
5105-28240-0021	before starting it was indispensable that the engine of the dobrina should be repaired to sail under canvas only would in contrary winds and rough seas be both tedious and difficult
5105-28240-0022	It was on the last day of January that the repairs of the schooner were completed.
5105-28240-0023	a slight diminution in the excessively high temperature which had prevailed for the last few weeks was the only apparent change in the general order of things but whether this was to be attributed to any alteration in the earth's orbit was a question which would still require several days to decide
5105-28240-0024	doubts now arose and some discussion followed whether or not it was desirable for ben zuf to accompany his master
5105-28241-0000	Her sea-going qualities were excellent, and would have amply sufficed for a circumnavigation of the globe.
5105-28241-0001	after an apprenticeship on a merchant ship he had entered the imperial navy and had already reached the rank of lieutenant when the count appointed him to the charge of his own private yacht in which he was accustomed to spend by far the greater part of his time throughout the winter generally cruising in the mediterranean whilst in the summer he visited more northern waters
5105-28241-0002	the late astounding events however had rendered procope manifestly uneasy and not the less so from his consciousness that the count secretly partook of his own anxiety
5105-28241-0003	Steam up and canvas spread, the schooner started eastwards.
5105-28241-0004	although only a moderate breeze was blowing the sea was rough a circumstance to be accounted for only by the diminution in the force of the earth's attraction rendering the liquid particles so buoyant that by the mere effect of oscillation they were carried to a height that was quite unprecedented
5105-28241-0005	For a few miles she followed the line hitherto presumably occupied by the coast of Algeria, but no land appeared to the south.
5105-28241-0006	The log and the compass, therefore, were able to be called upon to do the work of the sextant, which had become utterly useless.
5105-28241-0007	"'There's no fear of that, sir.'
5105-28241-0008	The Earth has undoubtedly entered upon a new orbit, but she is not incurring any probable risk of being precipitated onto the Sun.
5105-28241-0009	And what demonstration do you offer, asked Servadac eagerly, that it will not happen?
5105-28241-0010	Ocean reigned supreme.
5105-28241-0011	all the images of his past life floated upon his memory his thoughts sped away to his native france only to return again to wonder whether the depths of ocean would reveal any traces of the algerian metropolis
5105-28241-0012	"'Is it not impossible,' he murmured aloud, "'that any city should disappear so completely?'
5105-28241-0013	Would not the loftiest eminences of the city at least be visible?
5105-28241-0014	Another circumstance was most remarkable.
5105-28241-0015	to the surprise of all and especially of lieutenant procope the line indicated a bottom at a nearly uniform depth of from four to five fathoms and although the sounding was persevered with continuously for more than two hours over a considerable area the differences of level were insignificant not corresponding in any degree to what would be expected over the site of a city that had been terraced like the seats of an amphitheatre
5105-28241-0016	You must see, lieutenant, I should think, that we are not so near the coast of Algeria as you imagined.
5105-28241-0017	after pondering awhile he said if we were farther away i should expect to find a depth of two or three hundred fathoms instead of five fathoms five fathoms
5105-28241-0018	its depth remained invariable still four or at most five fathoms and although its bottom was assiduously dredged it was only to prove it barren of marine production of any type
5105-28241-0019	Nothing was to be done but to put about, and return in disappointment toward the north.
5142-33396-0000	At another time, Harold asked,
5142-33396-0001	"'What is your country, Olaf? Have you always been a thrall?' The thrall's eyes flashed.
5142-33396-0002	Two hundred warriors feasted in his hall and followed him to battle.
5142-33396-0003	the rest of you off a viking he had three ships
5142-33396-0004	These he gave to three of my brothers.
5142-33396-0005	but I stayed that spring and built me a boat.
5142-33396-0006	i made her for only twenty wars because i thought few men would follow me for i was young fifteen years old
5142-33396-0007	At the prow I carved the head with open mouth and forked tongue thrust out.
5142-33396-0008	I painted the eyes red for anger.
5142-33396-0009	"'There, stand so,' I said, and glare and hiss at my foes.
5142-33396-0010	In the stern I carved the tail up almost as high as the head.
5142-33396-0011	There she sat on the rollers, as fair a ship as I ever saw.
5142-33396-0012	Then I will get me a farm and will winter in that land. Now who will follow me?
5142-33396-0013	"'He is but a boy,' the man said.
5142-33396-0014	Thirty men, one after another, raised their horns and said,
5142-33396-0015	As our boat flashed down the rollers into the water, I made this song and sang it.
5142-33396-0016	So we harried the coast of Norway,
5142-33396-0017	We ate at many men's tables uninvited.
5142-33396-0018	My dragon's belly is never full, And on board went the gold.
5142-33396-0019	Oh, it is better to live on the sea and let other men raise your crops and cook your meals.
5142-33396-0020	A house smells of smoke, a ship smells of frolic.
5142-33396-0021	Up and down the water we went, to get much wealth and much frolic.
5142-33396-0022	"'What of the farm, Olaf?' "'Not yet,' I answered. "'Viking is better for summer.'
5142-33396-0023	It was so dark that I could see nothing but a few sparks on the hearth.
5142-33396-0024	I stood with my back to the wall, for I wanted no sword reaching out of the dark for me.
5142-33396-0025	"'Come, come!' I called, when no one obeyed. "'A fire!'
5142-33396-0026	My men laughed. Yes, a stingy host.
5142-33396-0027	He acts as though he had not expected us.
5142-33396-0028	On a bench in a far corner were a dozen people huddled together.
5142-33396-0029	"'Bring in the table. We are hungry.'
5142-33396-0030	The thralls were bringing in a great pot of meat.
5142-33396-0031	they set up a crane over the fire and hung the pot upon it and we sat and watched it boil while we joked at last the supper began
5142-33396-0032	the farmer sat gloomily on the bench and would not eat and you cannot wonder for he saw us putting potfuls of his good beef and basket-loads of bread into our big mouths
5142-33396-0033	"'You would not eat with us. You cannot say no to half of my ale. I drink this to your health.'
5142-33396-0034	then i drank half of the hornful and set the rest across the fire to the farmer he took it and smiled saying
5142-33396-0035	"'Did you ever have such a lordly guest before?' I went on.
5142-33396-0036	so I will give out this law that my men shall never leave you alone
5142-33396-0037	"'Hawkin' there shall be your constant companion, friend Farmer.'
5142-33396-0038	he should not leave you day or night whether you're working or playing or sleeping
5142-33396-0039	I named nine others and said,
5142-33396-0040	and these shall follow your thralls in the same way.
5142-33396-0041	So I set guards over everyone in that house.
5142-33396-0042	So no tales got out to the neighbors. Besides, it was a lonely place, and by good luck, no one came that way.
5142-33396-0043	Their eyes danced. Big Torleaf stood up and stretched himself.
5142-33396-0044	I'm stiff with long sitting, he said. I itch for a fight. I turned to the farmer.
5142-33396-0045	"'This is our last feast with you,' I said.'
5142-33396-0046	"'By the beard of Odin,' I cried, "'you have taken our joke like a man.'
5142-33396-0047	My men pounded the table with their fists.
5142-33396-0048	"'By the hammer of Thor!' shouted Grimm. "'There is no stingy coward.'
5142-33396-0049	"'Here, friend, take it,' and he thrust it into the farmer's hand.
5142-33396-0050	May you drink heart's ease from it for many years,
5142-33396-0051	and with it i leave you a name siph the friendly i shall hope to drink with you some time in valhalla
5142-33396-0052	"'Here is a ring for Sif the Friendly, and here is a bracelet, and a sword would not be a shame to hang at your side.'
5142-33396-0053	i took five great bracelets of gold from our treasure chest and gave them to him
5142-33396-0054	That is the best way to decide, for the spear will always point somewhere, and one thing is as good as another.
5142-33396-0055	That time it pointed us into your father's ships.
5142-33396-0056	Here, they said, is a rascal who has been harrying our coasts.
5142-33396-0057	We sunk his ship and men, but him we brought to you.
5142-33396-0058	"'A robber viking?' said the king, and he scowled at me.
5142-33396-0059	Yes, and with all your fingers it took you a year to catch me the king frowned more angrily I
5142-33396-0060	"'Take him out, Torkel, and let him taste your sword.'
5142-33396-0061	"'Your mother, the queen, was standing by.'
5142-33396-0062	Now she put her hand on his arm and smiled and said,
5142-33396-0063	"'And would he not be a good gift for our baby?'
5142-33396-0064	Your father thought a moment, then looked at your mother and smiled.
5142-33396-0065	"'Soft heart,' he said gently to her. "'Then to Torkel. Well, let him go, Torkel.'
5142-33396-0066	Then he turned to me again, frowning.
5142-33396-0067	But, young sharp-tongue, now that we have caught you, we will put you into a trap that you cannot get out of.
5142-33396-0068	So I lived, and now I'm your tooth-thrall. Well, it is the luck of war.
5142-36377-0000	It was one of the masterly and charming stories of Dumas the Elder.
5142-36377-0001	In five minutes I was in a new world, and my melancholy room was full of the liveliest French company.
5142-36377-0002	the sound of an imperative and uncompromising bell recalled me in due time to the regions of reality
5142-36377-0003	Ambrose met me at the bottom of the stairs and showed me the way to the supper-room.
5142-36377-0004	She signed to me with a ghostly solemnity to take the vacant place on the left of her father.
5142-36377-0005	The door opened again while I was still studying the two brothers, without, I honestly confess, being very favorably impressed by either of them.
5142-36377-0006	A new member of the family circle, who instantly attracted my attention, entered the room.
5142-36377-0007	A little cracked, that, in the popular phrase, was my impression of the stranger who now made his appearance in the supper-room.
5142-36377-0008	mr medecroft the elder having not spoken one word thus far himself introduced the new-comer to me with a side glance at his son's which had something like defiance in it a glance which as i was sorry to notice was returned with the defiance on their side by the two young men
5142-36377-0009	"'Philip Lefranc, this is my overlooker, Mr. Yonko,' said the old man, formally presenting us.'
5142-36377-0010	He is not well. He has come over the ocean for rest and change of scene.
5142-36377-0011	Mr. Yago is an American, Philip.
5142-36377-0012	"'Make acquaintance with Miss Diago. Sit together.'
5142-36377-0013	They pointedly drew back from John Iago as he approached the empty chair next to me and moved round to the opposite side of the table.
5142-36377-0014	a pretty girl and so far as i could judge by appearances a good girl too describing her generally i may say that she had a small head well carried and well set on her shoulders bright gray eyes that looked at you honestly and meant what they looked a trim slight little figure too slight for our english notions of beauty a strong american accent and a rare thing in america a pleasantly toned voice which made the accent agreeable to english ears
5142-36377-0015	Our first impressions of people are, in nine cases out of ten, the right impressions.
5142-36377-0016	For once in a way I proved a true prophet.
5142-36377-0017	The only cheerful conversation was the conversation across the table between Naomi and me.
5142-36377-0018	He looked up at Naomi doubtingly from his plate, and looked down again slowly with a frown.
5142-36377-0019	When I addressed him, he answered constrainedly.
5142-36377-0020	A more dreary and more disunited family party I never sat at the table with.
5142-36377-0021	envy hatred malice and uncharitableness are never so essentially detestable to my mind as when they are animated by the sense of propriety and work under the surface but for my interest in naomi and my other interest in the little love looks which i now and then surprised passing between her and ambrose i should never have sat through that supper
5142-36377-0022	i wish you good-night she laid her bony hands on the back of mr metcroft's invalid chair cut him short in his farewell salutation to me and wheeled him out to his bed as if she were wheeling him out to his grave
5142-36377-0023	You were quite right to say no, Ambrose began. Never smoke with Johnny Iago. His cigars will poison you.
5142-36377-0024	Naomi shook her forefinger reproachfully at them as if the two sturdy young farmers had been two children
5142-36377-0025	silas slunk away without a word of protest ambrose stood his ground evidently bent on making his peace with naomi before he left her seeing that i was in the way i walked aside toward a glass door at the lower end of the room
5142-36586-0000	It is manifest that man is now subject to much variability.
5142-36586-0001	So it is with the lower animals.
5142-36586-0002	the variability of multiple parts,
5142-36586-0003	but this subject will be more properly discussed when we treat of the different races of mankind.
5142-36586-0004	Effects of the increased use and disuse of parts.
5142-36600-0000	Chapter 7 On the Races of Man
5142-36600-0001	in determining whether two or more allied forms ought to be ranked as species or varieties naturalists are practically guided by the following considerations namely the amount of difference between them and whether such differences relate to few or many points of structure and whether they are of physiological importance but more especially whether they are constant
5639-40744-0000	eleven o'clock had struck it was a fine clear night they were the only persons on the road and they sauntered leisurely along to avoid paying the price of fatigue for the recreation provided for the toledans in the valley or on the banks of their river
5639-40744-0001	secure as he thought in the careful administration of justice in that city and the character of its well-disposed inhabitants the good hidalgo was far from thinking that any disaster could befall his family
5639-40744-0002	Rodolfo and his companions, with their faces muffled in their cloaks, stared rudely and insolently at the mother, the daughter, and the servant-maid.
5639-40744-0003	in a moment he communicated his thoughts to his companions and in the next moment they resolved to turn back and carry her off to please rudolpho for the rich who are open-handed always find parasites ready to encourage their bad propensities and thus to conceive this wicked design to communicate it approve it resolve on ravishing leucadia and to carry that design into effect was the work of a moment
5639-40744-0004	they drew their swords hid their faces in the flaps of their cloaks turned back and soon came in front of the little party who had not yet done giving thanks to god for their escape from those audacious men
5639-40744-0005	Finally, the one party went off exulting, and the other was left in desolation and woe.
5639-40744-0006	Rodolfo arrived at his own house without any impediment, and Leocadia's parents reached theirs, heartbroken and despairing.
5639-40744-0007	Meanwhile, Rudolfo had Leocadia safe in his custody and in his own apartment,
5639-40744-0008	Who touches me? Am I in bed?
5639-40744-0009	"'Mother, dear father, do you hear me?'
5639-40744-0010	It is the only amends I ask of you for the wrong you have done me.
5639-40744-0011	She found the door, but it was locked outside.
5639-40744-0012	she succeeded in opening the window and the moonlight shone in so brightly that she could distinguish the color of some damask hanging in the room
5639-40744-0013	she saw that the bed was gilded and so rich that it seemed that of a prince rather than of a private gentleman
5639-40744-0014	among other things on which she cast her eyes was a small crucifix of solid silver standing on a cabinet near the window
5639-40744-0015	this person was ridolfo who though he had gone to look for his friends had changed his mind in that respect not thinking it advisable to acquaint them with what had passed between him and the girl
5639-40744-0016	on the contrary he resolved to tell them that repenting of his violence and moved by her tears he had only carried her half-way towards his house and then let her go
5639-40744-0017	Choking with emotion, Leocadia made a sign to her parents that she wished to be alone with them.
5639-40744-0018	that would be very well my child replied her father if your plan were not liable to be frustrated by ordinary cunning but no doubt this image had been already missed by its owner and he will have set it down for certain that it was taken out of the room by the person he locked up there
5639-40744-0019	What you had best do, my child, is to keep it, and pray to it, that since it was a witness to your undoing, it will deign to vindicate your cause by its righteous judgment.
5639-40744-0020	thus did the humane and right-minded father comfort his unhappy daughter and her mother embracing her again did all she could to soothe the feelings
5639-40744-0021	she meanwhile passed her life with her parents in the strictest retirement never letting herself be seen but shunning every eye lest it should read her misfortune in her face
5639-40744-0022	time rolled on the hour of her delivery arrived it took place in the utmost secrecy her mother taking upon her the office of midwife and she gave birth to a son one of the most beautiful ever seen
5639-40744-0023	when the boy walked through the streets blessings were showered upon him by all who saw him blessing upon his beauty upon the mother that bore him upon the father that begot him upon those who brought him up so well
5639-40744-0024	One day when the boy was sent by his grandfather with a message to a relation, he passed along a street in which there was a great concourse of horsemen.
5639-40744-0025	the bed she too well remembered was there and above all the cabinet on which had stood the image she had taken away was still on the same spot
5639-40744-0026	louis was out of danger in a fortnight in a month he rose from his bed and during all that time he was visited daily by his mother and grandmother and treated by the master and mistress of the house as if he was their own child
5639-40744-0027	thus saying and pressing the crucifix to her breast she fell fainting into the arms of donna estafania who as a gentlewoman to whose sex pity is a natural as cruelty as to man instantly pressed her lips to those of the fainting girl shedding over her so many tears that there needed no other sprinkling of water to recover leucadia from her swoon
5639-40744-0028	i have great things to tell you senor said donna stefania to her husband the cream and substance of which is this the fainting girl before you is your daughter and the boy is your grandson
5639-40744-0029	This truth, which I have learned from her lips, is confirmed by his face, in which we have both beheld that of our son.
5639-40744-0030	just then leocadia came to herself and embracing the cross seemed changed into a sea of tears and the gentleman remaining in utter bewilderment until his wife had repeated to him from beginning to end leocadia's whole story and he believed it through the blessed dispensation of heaven which had confirmed it by so many convincing testimonies
5639-40744-0031	so persuasive were her entreaties and so strong her assurances that no harm whatever could result to them from the information she sought they were induced to confess that one summer's night the same she had mentioned themselves and another friend being out on a stroll with rodolpho they had been concerned in the abduction of a girl whom rodolpho carried off whilst the rest of them detained her family who made a great outcry and would have defended her if they could
5639-40744-0032	for god's sake my lady mother give me a wife who would be an agreeable companion not one who will disgust me so that we may both bear evenly and with mutual good-will the yoke imposed on us by heaven instead of pulling this way and that way and fretting each other to death
5639-40744-0033	her bearing was graceful and animated she led her son by the hand and before her walked two maids with wax lights and silver candlesticks
5639-40744-0034	all rose to do her reverence as if something from heaven had miraculously appeared before them but gazing on her entranced with admiration not one of them was able to address a single word to her
5639-40744-0035	she reflected how near she stood to the crisis which was to determine whether she was to be blessed or unhappy for ever and racked by the intensity of her emotions she suddenly changed color her head dropped and she fell forward in a swoon into the arms of the dismayed
5639-40744-0036	his mother had left her to him as being her destined protector but when she saw that he too was insensible she was near making a third and would have done so had he not come to himself
5639-40744-0037	know then son of my heart that this fainting lady is your real bride i say real because she is the one whom your father and i have chosen for you and the portrait was a pretence
5639-40744-0038	just at the moment when the tears of the pitying beholders flowed fastest and their ejaculations were most expressive of despair leocadia gave signs of recovery and brought back gladness to the hearts of all
5639-40744-0039	when she came to her senses and blushing to find herself in rodolfo's arms would have disengaged herself no senora he said that must not be strive not to withdraw from the arms of him who holds you in his soul
5639-40744-0040	this was done for the event took place at a time when the consent of the parties was sufficient for the celebration of a marriage without any of the preliminary formalities which are now so properly required
5639-40744-0041	nor was rodolpho less surprised than they and the better to assure himself of so wonderful a fact he begged leucadia to give him some token which should make perfectly clear to him that which indeed he did not doubt since it was authenticated by his parents
5683-32865-0000	"'You know, Captain Lake—'
5683-32865-0001	"'said Lord Shelford, addressing me.'
5683-32865-0002	"'He had his hand upon Lake's shoulder.'
5683-32865-0003	They are cousins, you know. We are all cousins.
5683-32865-0004	whatever lord shelford said miss brandon received it very graciously and even with a momentary smile
5683-32865-0005	but her greeting to captain leake was more than usually haughty and frozen and her features i fancied particularly proud and pale
5683-32865-0006	At dinner, Lake was easy and amusing.
5683-32865-0007	i'm glad you like it says wilder chuckling benignantly on it over his shoulder
5683-32865-0008	"'I believe I have a little taste that way. "'Those are all real, you know, those jewels.'
5683-32865-0009	and he placed it in that gentleman's fingers who now took his turn at the lamp and contemplated the little parallelogram with a gleam of sly amusement
5683-32865-0010	"'I was thinking it's very like the Ace of Hearts,' answered the captain softly, smiling on.
5683-32865-0011	whereupon Lake laughed quietly, still looking on the Ace of Hearts with his sly eyes.
5683-32865-0012	and wilder laughed too more suddenly and noisily than the humor of the joke seemed quite to call for and glanced a grim look from the corners of his eyes on lake but the gallant captain did not seem to perceive it and after a few seconds more he handed it very innocently back to mrs darthy only remarking
5683-32865-0013	Do you know? Lake? Oh, I really can't tell, but he'll soon tire of country life.
5683-32865-0014	"'He's not a man for country quarters.'
5683-32865-0015	I had a horrid dream about him last night. That?
5683-32865-0016	"'Oh, I know. That's Lorne Brandon.'
5683-32865-0017	All the time he was talking to me, his angry little eyes were following Lake.
5683-32866-0000	Miss Lake declined the carriage tonight.
5683-32866-0001	and he added something still less complimentary.
5683-32866-0002	But don't these very wise things sometimes turn out very foolishly?
5683-32866-0003	In the meantime I had formed a new idea of her.
5683-32866-0004	By this time Lord Chalford and Wilder returned, and, disgusted rather with myself, I ruminated on my want of generalship.
5683-32866-0005	and he made a little dip of his cane towards Brandon Hall over his shoulder.
5683-32866-0006	"'Yes,' so they said, "'but that would, I think, have been worse.'
5683-32866-0007	If a fellow's been a little bit wild, he's Beelzebub at once.
5683-32866-0008	Brackton's a very good fellow, I can assure you.
5683-32866-0009	i don't know and can't say how you fine gentlemen define wickedness only as an obscure female i speak according to my lights and he is generally thought the wickedest man in this county
5683-32866-0010	well you know rady women like wicked fellows it is contrast i suppose but they do and i'm sure from what brackton has said to me-i know him intimately that dorcas likes him and i can't conceive why they are not married
5683-32866-0011	Their walk continued silent for the greater part. Neither was quite satisfied with the other. But Rachel at last said,
5683-32866-0012	"'Now that's impossible, Rady, for I really don't think I once thought of him all this evening, except just while we were talking.'
5683-32866-0013	there was a bright moonlight broken by the shadows of overhanging boughs and withered leaves and the mottled lights and shadows glided oddly across his pale features
5683-32866-0014	Don't insult me, Stanley, by talking again as you did this morning.
5683-32866-0015	What I say is altogether on your own account.
5683-32866-0016	Mark my words, you'll find him too strong for you, aye, and too deep.
5683-32866-0017	I am very uneasy about it, whatever it is. I can't help it.
5683-32866-0018	To my mind, there has always been something inexpressibly awful in family feuds.
5683-32866-0019	The mystery of their origin, their capacity for evolving latent faculties of crime, and the steady vitality with which they survive the hearse and speak their deep-mouthed malignities in every newborn generation have associated them somehow in my mind with a spell of life exceeding and distinct from human and a special satanic action.
5683-32866-0020	The floor, more than anything else, showed the great age of the room.
5683-32866-0021	My bed was unexceptionally comfortable, but, in my then mood, I could have wished it a great deal more modern.
5683-32866-0022	Its curtains were of thick and faded tapestry.
5683-32866-0023	All the furniture belonged to other times.
5683-32866-0024	I shan't trouble you about my train of thoughts or fancies, but I began to feel very like a gentleman in a ghost story, watching experimentally in a haunted chamber.
5683-32866-0025	I did not even take the precaution of smoking up the chimney.
5683-32866-0026	I boldly lighted my cheroot.
5683-32866-0027	A cold, bright moon was shining with clear, sharp lights and shadows.
5683-32866-0028	The somber old trees, like gigantic hearse plumes, black and awful.
5683-32866-0029	Somehow, I had grown nervous.
5683-32866-0030	A little bit of plaster tumbled down the chimney and startled me confoundedly.
5683-32879-0000	It was not very much past eleven that morning when the pony carriage from Brandon drew up before the little garden wicket of Redmond's Farm.
5683-32879-0001	Well, she was better, though she had had a bad night.
5683-32879-0002	so there came a step and a little rustling of feminine draperies the small door opened and rachel entered with her hand extended and a pale smile of welcome
5683-32879-0003	Women can hide their pain better than we men, and bear it better too, except when shame drops fire into the dreadful chalice.
5683-32879-0004	But poor Rachel Lake had more than that stoical hypocrisy which enables the tortured spirits of her sex to lift a pale face through the flames and smile.
5683-32879-0005	This transient spring and lighting up are beautiful, a glamour beguiling our senses.
5683-32879-0006	there was something of sweetness and fondness in her tones and manner which was new to rachel and comforting and she returned the greeting as kindly and felt more like her former self
5683-32879-0007	Rachel's pale and sharpened features and dilated eye struck her with a painful surprise.
5683-32879-0008	You have been so ill, my poor Rachel.
5683-32879-0009	"'Ill and troubled, dear, troubled in mind and miserably nervous.'
5683-32879-0010	Poor Rachel! Her nature recoiled from deceit, and she told, at all events, as much of the truth as she dared.
5683-32879-0011	She spoke with a sudden energy which partook of fear and passion, and flushed her thin cheek and made her languid eyes flash.
5683-32879-0012	Thank you, Rachel. My cousin Rachel. My only friend.
5683-32879-0013	chelford had a note from mr wilder this morning another note his coming delayed and something of his having to see some person who is abroad continued dorcas after a little pause
5683-32879-0014	"'Yes, something—everything,' said Rachel, hurriedly looking frowningly at a flower which she was twirling in her fingers.
5683-32879-0015	"'Yes,' said Rachel.
5683-32879-0016	and the wan oracle having spoken she sat down in the same sort of abstraction again beside dorcas and she looked full in her cousin's eyes
5683-32879-0017	of mark wilder i say this his name has been for years hateful to me and recently it has become frightful and you will promise me simply this that you will never ask me to speak again about him
5683-32879-0018	It is an antipathy, an antipathy I cannot get over, dear Dorcas. You may think it a madness, but don't blame me.
5683-32879-0019	I have very few to love me now, and I thought you might love me, as I have begun to love you.
5683-32879-0020	And she threw her arms round her cousin's neck, and brave Rachel at last burst into tears.
5683-32879-0021	Dorcas, in her strange way, was moved.
5683-32879-0022	"'I like you still, Rachel. I'm sure I'll always like you.'
5683-32879-0023	You resemble me, Rachel. You are fearless and inflexible and generous.
5683-32879-0024	Yes, Rachel, I do love you.
5683-32879-0025	Thank you, Dorcas, dear.
61-70968-0000	He began a confused complaint against the wizard, who had vanished behind the curtain on the left.
61-70968-0001	Give not so earnest a mind to these mummeries, child.
61-70968-0002	a golden fortune and a happy life?
61-70968-0003	He was like unto my father, in a way, and yet was not my father.
61-70968-0004	Also there was a stripling page who turned into a maid.
61-70968-0005	This was so, sweet lady, sir, and in some manner I do think she died.
61-70968-0006	but then the picture was gone as quickly as it came.
61-70968-0007	Sister Nell, do you hear these marvels?
61-70968-0008	Take your place and let us see what the crystal can show to you.
61-70968-0009	Like as not, young master, though I am an old man.
61-70968-0010	Forthwith all ran to the opening of the tent to see what might be amiss, but Master Will, who peeped out first, needed no more than one glance.
61-70968-0011	He gave way to the others very readily, and retreated unperceived by the squire and mistress Fitzuth to the rear of the tent.
61-70968-0012	Cries of, "'A Nottingham! A Nottingham!'
61-70968-0013	Before them fled the stroller and his three sons, capless and terrified.
61-70968-0014	"'What is the tumult and rioting?' cried out the squire authoritatively, and he blew twice on the silver whistle which hung at his belt.
61-70968-0015	Nay, we refused their request most politely, most noble, said the little stroller.
61-70968-0016	and then they became vexed and would have snatched your purse from us.
61-70968-0017	I could not see my boy injured, Excellence, for but doing his duty as one of Cumberland's
61-70968-0018	So, I did push this fellow.
61-70968-0019	It is enough, said George Gamewell sharply, as he turned upon the crowd.
61-70968-0020	"'Shame on you, citizens!' cried he. "'I blush for my fellows of Nottingham!'
61-70968-0021	Surely we can submit with good grace.
61-70968-0022	"'Tis fine for you to talk, old man," answered the lean, sullen apprentice.
61-70968-0023	But I wrestled with this fellow, and do know that he played unfairly in the second bout.
61-70968-0024	spoke the squire, losing all patience. And it was to you that I gave another person consolation.
61-70968-0025	Come to me, men! Here! Here!" He raised his voice still louder.
61-70968-0026	The strollers took their part in it with hearty zest now that they had some chance of beating off their foes.
61-70968-0027	Robin and the little tumbler between them tried to force the squire to stand back, and very valiantly did these two comport themselves.
61-70968-0028	The head and chief of the riot, the Nottingham apprentice, with clenched fists, threatened Montfichet.
61-70968-0029	The squire helped to thrust them all in and entered swiftly himself.
61-70968-0030	Now be silent on your lives, he began, but the captured apprentice set up an instant shout.
61-70968-0031	Silence, you knave! cried Montfichet.
61-70968-0032	He felt for and found the wizard's black cloth. The squire was quite out of breath.
61-70968-0033	Thrusting open the proper entrance of the tent, Robin suddenly rushed forth with his burden with a great shout.
61-70968-0034	Amont Vichy, Amont Vichy, game well to the rescue!
61-70968-0035	Taking advantage of this, the squire's few men redoubled their efforts, and, encouraged by Robbins and the little stroller's cries, fought their way to him.
61-70968-0036	George Montfichet will never forget this day.
61-70968-0037	"'What is your name, lording?' asked the little stroller presently.
61-70968-0038	Robin Fitzsuth
61-70968-0039	And mine is Will Stutley. Shall we be comrades?
61-70968-0040	"'Write willingly, for between us we have won the battle,' answered Robin.
61-70968-0041	i like you will you are the second will that i have met and liked within two days is there a sign in that
61-70968-0042	Montfichet called out for Robin to give him an arm.
61-70968-0043	"'Friends,' said Montfichet faintly to the wrestlers, "'bear us escort so far as the sheriff's house.'
61-70968-0044	It will not be safe for you to stay here now.
61-70968-0045	Pray follow us, with mine and my Lord Sheriff's men.
61-70968-0046	Nottingham Castle was reached, and admittance was demanded.
61-70968-0047	Master Monceau, the sheriff of Nottingham, was mightily put about when told of the rioting.
61-70968-0048	and Henry might return to England at any moment.
61-70968-0049	have your will child if the boy also wills it montfich answered feeling too ill to oppose anything very strongly just then
61-70968-0050	He made an effort to hide his condition from them all, and Robin felt his fingers tighten upon his arm.
61-70968-0051	Make me a room of the sheriff, child, quickly.
61-70968-0052	But who is this fellow plucking at your sleeve?
61-70968-0053	"'He is my esquire, Excellency,' returned Robin with dignity.
61-70968-0054	mistress fitzuth had been carried off by the sheriff's daughter and her maids as soon as they had entered the house so that robin alone had the care of montfichet
61-70968-0055	Robin was glad when, at length, they were left to their own devices.
61-70968-0056	The wine did certainly bring back the color to the squire's cheeks.
61-70968-0057	These escapades are not for old Gamewell, lad. His day has come to twilight.
61-70968-0058	Will you forgive me now?
61-70968-0059	It'll be no disappointment to me.
61-70968-0060	No thanks. I am glad to give you such easy happiness.
61-70968-0061	"'You are a worthy leech, Will,' presently whispered Robin. "'The wine has worked a marvel.'
61-70968-0062	I and show you some pretty tricks.
61-70970-0000	Young Fitz-Wuth had been commanded to his mother's chamber so soon as he had come out from his converse with the Squire.
61-70970-0001	There befell an anxious interview, Mistress Fitzuth arguing for and against the Squire's project in a breath.
61-70970-0002	Most of all, Robin thought of his father. What would he counsel?
61-70970-0003	If, for a whim, you beggar yourself, I cannot stay you.
61-70970-0004	but take it whilst i live and wear montfichet's shield in the days when my eyes can be rejoiced by so brave a sight for you will ne'er disgrace our dutch and i warrant me
61-70970-0005	The lad had checked him then.
61-70970-0006	"'Never that, sir,' he had said.
61-70970-0007	He was in deep converse with the clerk, and entered the hall holding him by the arm.
61-70970-0008	Now to bed, boy.
61-70970-0009	"'tis late, and I go myself within a short space."
61-70970-0010	Dismiss your squire, Robin, and bid me good-eaten.
61-70970-0011	"'As any in England, I would say,' said Gamewell proudly. "'That is, in his day.'
61-70970-0012	yet he will teach you a few tricks when morning is come.
61-70970-0013	There was no chance to alter his sleeping-room to one nearer to Gamewell's chamber.
61-70970-0014	Presently, he crossed the floor of his room with decided step.
61-70970-0015	"'Will!' cried he softly, and Stutley, who had chosen his couch across the door of his young master's chamber, sprang up at once in answer.
61-70970-0016	We will go out together to the bower. There is a way down to the court from my window.
61-70970-0017	Rest, and be still until I warn you.
61-70970-0018	The hours passed wearily by, and movement could yet be heard about the hall.
61-70970-0019	At last all was quiet and black in the courtyard of Gamewell.
61-70970-0020	"'Will,' whispered Robin, opening his door as he spoke, "'are you ready?'
61-70970-0021	They then renewed their journey, and, under the better light, made a safe crossing of the stable roofs.
61-70970-0022	Robin entered the hut, dragging the unwilling esquire after him.
61-70970-0023	"'Be not so foolish, friend,' said Fitzuth crossly.
61-70970-0024	They moved thereafter cautiously about the hut, groping before and about them to find something to show that Warrington had fulfilled his mission.
61-70970-0025	They were upon the verge of an open trap in the far corner of the hut, and Stutley had tripped over the edge of the reversed flap-mouth of this pit.
61-70970-0026	Fithuth's hand rested at last upon the top rung of a ladder, and slowly the truth came to him.
61-70970-0027	Robin carefully descended the ladder and found himself soon upon firm rocky ground.
61-70970-0028	Stutley was by his side in a flash, and then they both began feeling about them to ascertain the shape and character of this vault.
61-70970-0029	From the blackness behind the light they heard a voice. Warrington's.
61-70970-0030	Save me, masters, but you startled me rarely.
61-70970-0031	cried he, waving the lanthorn before him to make sure that these were no ghosts in front of him.
61-70970-0032	inquired Robin, with his suspicion still upon him.
61-70970-0033	Truly, such a horse would be worth much in Nottingham Fair.
61-70970-0034	nay nay lording answered warrenton with a half laugh
61-70970-0035	Warrington spoke thus with significance, to show Robin that he was not to think Geoffrey's claims to the estate would be passed by.
61-70970-0036	Robin Fitzhuth saw that his doubts of Warrington had been unfair, and he became ashamed of himself for harboring them.
61-70970-0037	His tones rang pleasantly on Warrington's ears, and forthwith a good fellowship was heralded between them,
61-70970-0038	the old servant told him quietly as they crept back to gamewell that this passageway led from the hut in the pleasance to sherwood and that geoffrey for the time was hiding with the outlaws in the forest
61-70970-0039	He implores us to be discreet as the grave in this matter, for in sooth his life is in the hollow of our hands.
61-70970-0040	They regain their apartment apparently without disturbing the household of Gainwell.
672-122797-0000	Out in the woods stood a nice little fir tree.
672-122797-0001	the place he had was a very good one the sun shone on him as to fresh air there was enough of that and round him grew many large-sized comrades pines as well as firs
672-122797-0002	he did not think of the warm sun and of the fresh air he did not care for the little cottage children that ran about and prattled when they were in the woods looking for wild strawberries
672-122797-0003	But this was what the tree could not bear to hear.
672-122797-0004	in winter when the snow lay glittering on the ground a hare would often come leaping along and jump right over the little tree
672-122797-0005	Oh, that made him so angry!
672-122797-0006	to grow and grow to get older and be tall thought the tree that after all is the most delightful thing in the world
672-122797-0007	In autumn, the woodcutters always came and felled some of the largest trees.
672-122797-0008	This happened every year, and the young fir tree that had now grown to a very comely size trembled at the sight, for the magnificent great trees fell to the earth with noise and cracking, the branches were lopped off, and the trees looked long and bare. They were hardly to be recognized.
672-122797-0009	Have you not met them anywhere?
672-122797-0010	"'Rejoice in thy growth,' said the sunbeams.
672-122797-0011	And then? What happens then?
672-122797-0012	i would fain know if i am destined for so glorious a career cried the tree rejoicing
672-122797-0013	I am now tall, and my branches spread like the others that were carried off last year. Oh!
672-122797-0014	were I but already on the cart.
672-122797-0015	"'were I in the warm room with all the splendour and magnificence.'
672-122797-0016	Yes, then something better, something still grander, will surely follow. Or wherefore should they thus ornament me?
672-122797-0017	Something better, something still grander must follow. But what?'
672-122797-0018	"'Rejoice in our presence,' said the air and the sunlight.
672-122797-0019	Rejoice in thy own fresh youth!
672-122797-0020	but the tree did not rejoice at all he grew and grew and was green both winter and summer
672-122797-0021	and towards christmas he was one of the first that was cut down
672-122797-0022	the axe struck deep into the very pith the tree fell to the earth with a sigh he felt a pang it was like a swoon he could not think of happiness for he was sorrowful at being separated from his home from the place where he had sprung up
672-122797-0023	he well knew that he should never see his dear old comrades the little bushes and flowers around him any more perhaps not even the birds
672-122797-0024	The departure was not at all agreeable.
672-122797-0025	the tree only came to himself when he was unloaded in a courtyard with the other trees and heard a man say that one is splendid we don't want the others
672-122797-0026	there too were large easy chairs silken sofas large tables full of picture-books and full of toys worth hundreds and hundreds of crowns at least the children said so
672-122797-0027	The servants, as well as the young ladies, decorated it.
672-122797-0028	"'This evening,' they all said.
672-122797-0029	How it will shine this evening!
672-122797-0030	"'Perhaps the other trees from the forest will come to look at me.'
672-122797-0031	It blazed up famously. "'Help! Help!'
672-122797-0032	cried the young ladies, and they quickly put out the fire.
672-122797-0033	A story?
672-122797-0034	"'A story!' cried the children, drawing a little fat man towards the tree.
672-122797-0035	"'But I shall tell only one story.'
672-122797-0036	Humpy-dumpy fell downstairs, and yet he married the princess.
672-122797-0037	That's the way of the world!"
672-122797-0038	thought the fir tree, and believed it all, because the man who told the story was so good-looking. Well, well,
672-122797-0039	I won't tremble tomorrow, thought the fir tree.
672-122797-0040	And the whole night the tree stood still and in deep thought.
672-122797-0041	In the morning the servant and the housemaid came in.
672-122797-0042	but they dragged him out of the room and up the stairs into the loft and here in a dark corner where no daylight could enter they left him
672-122797-0043	"'What's the meaning of this?' thought the tree.
672-122797-0044	and he leaned against the wall, lost in reverie.
672-122797-0045	time enough had he too for his reflections for days and nights passed on and nobody came up and when at last somebody did come it was only to put some great trunks in a corner out of the way
672-122797-0046	"'Tis now winter out of doors,' thought the tree.
672-122797-0047	How kind man is, after all!
672-122797-0048	if it only were not so dark here and so terribly lonely.
672-122797-0049	Squeak! Squeak!
672-122797-0050	They snuffed about the fir tree and rustled among the branches.
672-122797-0051	"'I am by no means old,' said the fir-tree.
672-122797-0052	"'There's many a one considerably older than I am.'
672-122797-0053	They were so extremely curious.
672-122797-0054	"'I know no such place,' said the tree.
672-122797-0055	and then he told all about his youth and the little mice had never heard the like before and they listened and said
672-122797-0056	said the fir tree, thinking over what he had himself related.
672-122797-0057	Yes, in reality, those were happy times.
672-122797-0058	who is humpy dumpty asked the mice
672-122797-0059	"'Only that one,' answered the tree.
672-122797-0060	It is a very stupid story.
672-122797-0061	Don't you know one about bacon and tallow candles? Can't you tell any louder stories?"
672-122797-0062	No, said the tree.
672-122797-0063	Then good-bye, said the rats, and they went home.
672-122797-0064	at last the little mice stayed away also and the tree sighed after all it was very pleasant when the sleek little mice sat round me and listened to what i told them
672-122797-0065	Now that, too, is over.
672-122797-0066	Why, one morning there came a quantity of people and set to work in the loft.
672-122797-0067	the trunks were moved the tree was pulled out and thrown rather hard it is true down on the floor but a man drew him towards the stairs where the daylight shone
672-122797-0068	but it was not the fir tree that they meant.
672-122797-0069	It was in a corner that he lay, among weeds and nettles.
672-122797-0070	The golden star of tinsel was still on the top of the tree and glittered in the sunshine.
672-122797-0071	in the courtyard some of the merry children were playing who had danced at christmas round the fir-tree and were so glad at the sight of him
672-122797-0072	and the gardener's boy chopped the tree into small pieces there was a whole heap lying there
672-122797-0073	The wood flamed up splendidly under the large brewing copper, and it sighed so deeply.
672-122797-0074	However, that was over now. The tree gone, the story at an end.
6829-68769-0000	kenneth and beth refrained from telling the other girls or uncle john of old will rogers visit but they got mr watson in the library and questioned him closely about the penalty for forging a check
6829-68769-0001	it was a serious crime indeed mr watson told them and tom gates bade fair to serve a lengthy term in the state's prison as a consequence of his rash act
6829-68769-0002	I can't see it in that light, said the old lawyer.
6829-68769-0003	It was a deliberate theft from his employers to protect a girl he loved.
6829-68769-0004	But they could not have proven a case against Lucy if she was innocent and all their threats of arresting her were probably a mere bluff.
6829-68769-0005	"'He was soft-hearted and impetuous,' said Beth, "'and being in love he didn't stop to count the cost.'
6829-68769-0006	If the prosecution were withdrawn and the case settled with the victim of the forged check, then the young man would be allowed his freedom.
6829-68769-0007	but under the circumstances, I doubt if such an arrangement could be made.
6829-68769-0008	Fairview was twelve miles away, but by ten o'clock they drew up at the county trail.
6829-68769-0009	They were received in the little office by a man named Markham, who was the jailer,
6829-68769-0010	"'We wish to talk with him,' answered Kenneth. "'Talk?'
6829-68769-0011	I'm running for representative on the Republican ticket, said Kenneth quietly.
6829-68769-0012	"'Oh, say, that's different,' observed Markham, altering his demeanor.
6829-68769-0013	May we see Gates at once? asked Kenneth.
6829-68769-0014	They followed the jailer along a succession of passages,
6829-68769-0015	Sometimes I'm that yearning for a smoke I'm nearly crazy, and I don't know which is worse, dying one way or the other.
6829-68769-0016	He unlocked the door and called, Here's visitors, Tom.
6829-68769-0017	Worst Tom, worse than ever, replied the jailer gloomily.
6829-68769-0018	"'Mr. Graff,' said Kenneth, noticing the boy's face critically, as he stood where the light from the passage fell upon it.
6829-68769-0019	Sorry, we haven't any reception room in the jail.
6829-68769-0020	"'Sit down, please,' said Gates in a cheerful and pleasant voice. "'There's a bench here.'
6829-68769-0021	A fresh, wholesome-looking boy was Tom Gates, with steady gray eyes, an intelligent forehead, but a sensitive, rather weak mouth.
6829-68769-0022	"'We have heard something of your story,' said Kenneth, "'and are interested in it.'
6829-68769-0023	I didn't stop to think whether it was foolish or not. I did it, and I'm glad I did it.
6829-68769-0024	Old Will is a fine fellow, but poor and helpless since Mrs. Rogers had her accident.
6829-68769-0025	Then Rogers wouldn't do anything but lead her around and wait upon her, and the place went to rack and ruin.
6829-68769-0026	He spoke simply, but paced up and down the narrow cell in front of them,
6829-68769-0027	"'Whose name did you sign to the cheque?' asked Kenneth.
6829-68769-0028	He is supposed to sign all the checks of the concern.
6829-68769-0029	It's a stock company in Rich.
6829-68769-0030	I was bitkeeper, so it was easy to get a blank check and forge the signature.
6829-68769-0031	As regards my robbing the company, I'll say that I saved him a heavy loss one day.
6829-68769-0032	I discovered and put out a fire that would have destroyed the whole plant, but Marshall never even thanked me,
6829-68769-0033	"'It was better for him to think the girl unfailing than to know the truth.'
6829-68769-0034	"'I'm going to see Mr. Marshall,' said Kenneth, "'and discover what I can do to assist you.' "'Thank you, sir.'
6829-68769-0035	It won't be much, but I'm grateful to find a friend.
6829-68769-0036	They left him then, for the jailer arrived to unlock the door and escort them to the office.
6829-68769-0037	I've seen lots of that kind in my day.
6829-68769-0038	and it ruins a man's disposition.
6829-68769-0039	He looked up rather ungraciously, but motioned them to be seated.
6829-68769-0040	Some girl has been in here twice to interview my men, and I have refused to admit her.
6829-68769-0041	I'm not electioneering just now.
6829-68769-0042	Oh, well, sir, what about him?
6829-68769-0043	and he deserves a term in state's prison.
6829-68769-0044	It has cost me twice sixty dollars in annoyance.
6829-68769-0045	I'll pay all the costs besides.
6829-68769-0046	You're foolish. Why should you do all this?
6829-68769-0047	"'I have my own reasons, Mr. Marshall.'
6829-68769-0048	Give me a check for $150, and I'll turn over to you the forged check and quash further proceedings.
6829-68769-0049	he detested the grasping disposition that would endeavor to take advantage of his evident desire to help young gates
6829-68769-0050	Beth, uneasy at his silence, nudged him.
6829-68769-0051	There was a grim smile of amusement on his shrewd face.
6829-68769-0052	He might have had that forged check for the face of it if he'd been sharp.
6829-68769-0053	and to think we can save all that misery and despair by the payment of a hundred and fifty dollars.
6829-68771-0000	so to the surprise of the democratic committee and all his friends mr hopkins announced that he would oppose forbes's aggressive campaign with an equal aggressiveness and spend as many dollars in doing so as might be necessary
6829-68771-0001	one of mr hopkins's first tasks after calling his faithful henchmen around him was to make a careful canvass of the voters of his district to see what was still to be accomplished
6829-68771-0002	the weak-kneed contingency must be strengthened and fortified and a couple of hundred votes in one way or the other secured from the opposition
6829-68771-0003	The Democratic Committee figured out a way to do this.
6829-68771-0004	Under ordinary conditions, Reynolds was sure to be elected, but the committee proposed to sacrifice him in order to elect Hopkins.
6829-68771-0005	The only thing necessary was to fix Seth Reynolds, and this Hopkins arranged personally.
6829-68771-0006	and this was why Kenneth and Beth discovered him conversing with the young woman in the buggy.
6829-68771-0007	the description she gave of the coming reception to the women's political league was so humorous and diverting that they were both laughing heartily over the thing when the young people passed them and thus mr hopkins failed to notice who the occupants of the other vehicle were
6829-68771-0008	these women were flattered by the attention of the young lady and had promised to assist in electing mr forbes
6829-68771-0009	louise hoped for excellent results from this organization and wished the entertainment to be so effective in winning their good will that they would work earnestly for the cause in which they were enlisted
6829-68771-0010	the fairview band was engaged to discourse as much harmony as it could produce and the resources of the great house were taxed to entertain the guests
6829-68771-0011	Tables were spread on the lawn, and a dainty but substantial repast was to be served.
6829-68771-0012	this was the first occasion within a generation when such an entertainment had been given at elmhurst and the only one within the memory of man where the neighbours and country people had been the invited guests
6829-68771-0013	The attendance was unexpectedly large, and the girls were delighted, foreseeing great success for their fight.
6829-68771-0014	"'We ought to have more attendants, Beth,' said Louise, approaching her cousin.
6829-68771-0015	Won't you run into the house and see if Martha can't spare one or two more maids?
6829-68771-0016	She was very fond of the young ladies whom she had known when aunt Jane was their mistress here and Beth was her special favorite and
6829-68771-0017	The housekeeper led the way and Beth followed.
6829-68771-0018	for a moment beth stood staring while the new maid regarded her with composure and a slight smile upon her beautiful face
6829-68771-0019	She was dressed in the regulation costume of the maids at Elmhurst, a plain black gown with a white apron and cap.
6829-68771-0020	Then she gave a little laugh and replied, "'No, Miss Beth, I'm Elizabeth Parsons.'
6829-68771-0021	But it can't be, protested the girl.
6829-68771-0022	"'I attend to the household mending, you know, and care for the linen.'
6829-68771-0023	"'You speak like an educated person,' said Beth, wonderingly. "'Where is your home?'
6829-68771-0024	For the first time the maid seemed a little confused, and her gaze wandered from the face of her visitor.
6829-68771-0025	She sat down in a rocking-chair, and, clasping her hands in her lap, rocked slowly back and forth. "'I'm sorry,' said Beth.
6829-68771-0026	Eliza Parsons shook her head.
6829-68771-0027	They excite me in some way, and I can't bear them. You must excuse me.
6829-68771-0028	She even seemed mildly amused at the attention she attracted.
6829-68771-0029	beth was a beautiful girl the handsomest of the three cousins by far yet eliza surpassed her in natural charm and seemed well aware of the fact
6829-68771-0030	Her manner was neither independent nor assertive, but rather one of well-bred composure and calm reliance.
6829-68771-0031	Her eyes wandered to the maid's hands.
6829-68771-0032	However, her features and form might repress any evidence of nervousness. These hands told a different story.
6829-68771-0033	she rose quickly to her feet with an impetuous gesture that made her visitor catch her breath.
6829-68771-0034	"'I wish I knew myself,' she cried fiercely.
6829-68771-0035	Will you leave me alone in my own room or must I go away to escape you?
6829-68771-0036	Eliza closed the door behind her with a decided slam and a key clicked in the lock
6930-75918-0000	Concord returned to its place amidst the tents.
6930-75918-0001	the english forwarded to the french baskets of flowers of which they had made a plentiful provision to greet the arrival of the young princess the french in return invited the english to a supper which was to be given the next day
6930-75918-0002	Congratulations were poured in upon the princess everywhere during her journey.
6930-75918-0003	from the respect paid her on all sides she seemed like a queen and from the adoration with which she was treated by two or three she appeared an object of worship the queen-mother gave the french the most affectionate reception france was her native country and she had suffered too much unhappiness in england for england to have made her forget france
6930-75918-0004	she taught her daughter then by her own affection for it that love for a country where they had both been hospitably received and where a brilliant future opened for them
6930-75918-0005	the count had thrown himself back on his seat leaning his shoulders against the partition of the tent and remained thus his face buried in his hands with heaving chest and restless limbs
6930-75918-0006	This has, indeed, been a harassing day," continued the young man, his eyes fixed upon his friend.
6930-75918-0007	You will be frank with me? I always am.
6930-75918-0008	Can you imagine why Buckingham has been so violent? I suspect.
6930-75918-0009	"'It is you who are mistaken, Raoul. I have read his distress in his eyes, in his every gesture and action the whole day.'
6930-75918-0010	I can perceive love clearly enough.
6930-75918-0011	I am convinced of what I say, said the Count.
6930-75918-0012	It is annoyance then.
6930-75918-0013	In those very terms, I even added more.
6930-75918-0014	but continued raoul not interrupted by this movement of his friend heaven be praised the french who are pronounced to be thoughtless and indiscreet reckless even are capable of bringing a calm and sound judgment to bear on matters of such high importance
6930-75918-0015	Thus, it is that the honor of three is saved, our country, our masters, and our own.
6930-75918-0016	Yes, I need repose. Many things have agitated me today, both in mind and body. When you return tomorrow, I shall no longer be the same man.
6930-75918-0017	but in this friendly pressure Rao could detect the nervous agitation of a great internal conflict.
6930-75918-0018	the night was clear starlit and splendid the tempest had passed away and the sweet influences of the evening had restored life peace and security everywhere
6930-75918-0019	upon the large square in front of the hotel the shadows of the tents intersected by the golden moonbeams formed as it were a huge mosaic of jet and yellow flagstones
6930-75918-0020	bragelonne watched for some time the conduct of the two lovers listened to the loud and uncivil slumbers of manekamp who snored as imperiously as though he was wearing his blue and gold instead of his violet suit
6930-76324-0000	Goliath makes another discovery.
6930-76324-0001	they were certainly no near the solution of their problem.
6930-76324-0002	"'The poor little things,' cried Cynthia, "'think of them having been turned to the wall all these years!'
6930-76324-0003	Now what is the sense of it? Two innocent babies like that.
6930-76324-0004	But Joyce had not been listening. All at once she put down her candle on the table and faced her companion.
6930-76324-0005	The twin brother did something she didn't like and she turned his picture to the wall.
6930-76324-0006	Hers happened to be on the same frame too, but she evidently didn't care about it.
6930-76324-0007	"'Now what have you to say, Cynthia Sprague?'
6930-76324-0008	I thought we were stumped again when I first saw that picture, but it's been of some use after all.
6930-76324-0009	Do you suppose the miniature was a copy of the same thing?
6930-76324-0010	"'What in the world is it?' queried Joyce.
6930-76324-0011	They worry me terribly, and besides, I'd like to see what this lovely furniture looks like without such quantities of dust all over it. Good scheme, Sin!
6930-76324-0012	We'll come in here this afternoon with old clothes on and have a regular house cleaning.
6930-76324-0013	It can't hurt anything, I'm sure, for we won't disturb things at all.
6930-76324-0014	This thought, however, did not enter the heads of the enthusiastic pair.
6930-76324-0015	smuggling the house-cleaning paraphernalia into the cellar window unobserved that afternoon proved no easy task for cynthia had added a whisk broom and dust-pan to the outfit
6930-76324-0016	the lure proved too much for him and he came sporting after it as friskily as a young kitten much to cynthia's delight when she caught sight of him
6930-76324-0017	Oh, let him come along, she urged. I do love to see him about that old house.
6930-76324-0018	he makes it sort of cozier.
6930-76324-0019	Now let's dust the furniture and pictures.
6930-76324-0020	Yet, little as it was, it had already made a vast difference in the aspect of the room.
6930-76324-0021	surface dust at least had been removed and the fine old furniture gave a hint of its real elegance and polish
6930-76324-0022	Then, she suddenly remarked,
6930-76324-0023	and my pocket money is getting low again and you haven't any left as usual
6930-76324-0024	they say illumination by candlelight is the prettiest in the world
6930-76324-0025	"'Why, it's Goliath, as usual!' they both cried, peering in."
6930-76324-0026	Isn't he the greatest for getting into odd corners?
6930-76324-0027	forgetting all their weariness they seized their candles and scurried through the house finding on occasional paper tucked away in some odd corner
6930-76324-0028	Well, I'm convinced that the boarded-up house mystery happened not earlier than April 16th, 1861, and probably not much later.
6930-81414-0000	no words were spoken no language was uttered save that of wailing and hissing and that somehow was indistinct as if it existed in fancy and not in reality
6930-81414-0001	i heard a noise behind i turned and saw kaffir his black eyes shining while in his hand he held a gleaming knife he lifted it above his head as if to strike but i had the strength of ten men and i hurled him from me
6930-81414-0002	"'Onward!' said a distant voice.
6930-81414-0003	No sound broke the stillness of the night.
6930-81414-0004	the story of its evil influence came back to me and in my bewildered condition i wondered whether there was not some truth in what had been said
6930-81414-0005	What was that?
6930-81414-0006	What then? A human hand, large and shapely, appeared distinctly on the surface of the pond.
6930-81414-0007	nothing more, not even the wrist to which it might be attached.
6930-81414-0008	it did not beckon or indeed move at all it was as still as the hand of death
6930-81414-0009	i awoke to consciousness fighting at first it seemed as if i was fighting with a phantom but gradually my opponent became more real to me it was
6930-81414-0010	A sound of voices, a flash of light.
6930-81414-0011	A feeling of freedom, and I was awake. Where?
6930-81414-0012	said another voice which i recognized as voltaire's
6930-81414-0013	i had scarcely known what i had been saying or doing up to this time but as he spoke i looked at my hand
6930-81414-0014	in the light of the moon i saw a knife red with blood and my hand too was also discolored
6930-81414-0015	I do not know. I am dazed, bewildered.
6930-81414-0016	But that is Caffer's knife.
6930-81414-0017	I know he had it this very evening.
6930-81414-0018	I remembered saying, "'Have we been together?'
6930-81414-0019	Vulture picked up something from the ground and looked at it.
6930-81414-0020	I say, you do know what this means, and you must tell us."
6930-81414-0021	A terrible thought flashed into my mind.
6930-81414-0022	I had again been acting under the influence of this man's power.
6930-81414-0023	perchance too caffer's death might serve him in good stead
6930-81414-0024	my tongue refused to articulate my power of speech left me
6930-81414-0025	my position was too terrible
6930-81414-0026	My overwrought nerves yielded at last.
6930-81414-0027	For some time after that I remembered nothing distinctly
7021-79730-0000	The Three Modes of Management
7021-79730-0001	to suppose that the object of this work is to aid in effecting such a substitution as that is entirely to mistake its nature and design
7021-79730-0002	by reason and affection.
7021-79730-0003	As the chase drives away, Mary stands bewildered and perplexed on the doorstep, her mind in a tumult of excitement in which hatred of the doctor, distrust and suspicion of her mother, disappointment, vexation, and ill humor surge and swell among those delegate organizations on which the structure and development of the soul so closely depend.
7021-79730-0004	the mother as soon as the chase is so far turned that mary can no longer watch the expression of her countenance goes away from the door with a smile of complacency and satisfaction on her face at the ingenuity and success of her little artifice
7021-79730-0005	So you will be a good girl, I know, and not make any trouble, but will stay at home contentedly, won't you?'
7021-79730-0006	the mother in managing the case in this way relies partly on convincing the reason of the child and partly on an appeal to her affection
7021-79730-0007	If you should not be a good girl, but should show signs of making us any trouble, I shall have to send you out somewhere to the back part of the house until we are gone."
7021-79730-0008	but this last supposition is almost always unnecessary for if mary has been habitually managed on this principle she will not make any trouble
7021-79730-0009	it is indeed true that the importance of tact and skill in the training of the young and of cultivating their reason and securing their affection cannot be overrated
7021-79740-0000	to such persons these indirect modes of training children in habits of subordination to their will or rather of yielding to their influence are specially useful
7021-79740-0001	Della had a young sister named Maria and a cousin whose name was Jane.
7021-79740-0002	Now Delia contrived to obtain a great influence and ascendancy over the minds of the children by means of these dolls.
7021-79740-0003	To give an idea of these conversations, I will report one of them in full.
7021-79740-0004	You have come! Andela! Andela was the name of Jane's doll. To make Rosalie a visit.
7021-79740-0005	I am very glad.
7021-79740-0006	"'I expect you have been a very good girl, Andela, since you were here last.'
7021-79740-0007	Then, turning to Jane, she asked, in a somewhat altered tone, "'Has she been a good girl, Jane?'
7021-79740-0008	for instance one day the children had been playing upon the piazza with blocks and other playthings and finally had gone into the house leaving all the things on the floor of the piazza instead of putting them away in their places as they ought to have done
7021-79740-0009	They were now playing with their dolls in the parlor.
7021-79740-0010	delia came to the parlor and with an air of great mystery beckoned the children aside and said to them in a whisper leave andella and rosalie here and don't say a word to them
7021-79740-0011	so saying she led the way on tiptoe followed by the children out of the room and round by a circuitous route to the piazza there
7021-79740-0012	said she, pointing to the playthings. "'See?'
7021-79740-0013	Put these playthings all away quick and carefully and we will not let them know anything about your leaving them out.
7021-79740-0014	and this method of treating the case was much more effectual in making them disposed to avoid committing a similar fault another time than any direct rebukes or expressions of displeasure addressed personally to them would have been
7021-79759-0000	Nature of the effect produced by early impressions.
7021-79759-0001	That is comparatively nothing.
7021-79759-0002	They are chiefly formed from combinations of the impressions made in childhood.
7021-79759-0003	Vast importance and influence of this mental furnishing
7021-79759-0004	without going to any such extreme as this we can easily see on reflection how vast an influence on the ideas and conceptions as well as on the principles of action in mature years must be exerted by the nature and character of the images which the period of infancy and childhood impress upon the mind
7021-79759-0005	the pain produced by an act of hasty and angry violence to which a father subjects his son may soon pass away but the memory of it does not pass away with the pain
7021-85628-0000	But Anders cared nothing about that.
7021-85628-0001	he made a bow so deep that his back came near breaking and he was dumbfounded i can tell you when he saw it was nobody but anders
7021-85628-0002	He was such a big boy that he wore high boots and carried a jackknife.
7021-85628-0003	now this knife was a splendid one though half the blade was gone and the handle was a little cracked and anders knew that one is almost a man as soon as one has a jack-knife
7021-85628-0004	Yes, why not, thought Anders.
7021-85628-0005	Seeing that I am so fine, I may as well go and visit the king.
7021-85628-0006	"'I am going to the court ball,' answered Anders."
7021-85628-0007	and she took anders hand and walked with him up the broad marble stairs where soldiers were posted at every third step and through the magnificent halls where courtiers in silk and velvet stood bowing wherever he went
7021-85628-0008	For, like as not, they must have thought him a prince, when they saw his fine cap.
7021-85628-0009	At the farther end of the largest hall, a table was set with golden cups and golden plates in long rows.
7021-85628-0010	On huge silver platters were pyramids of tarts and cakes, and red wine sparkled in glittering decanters.
7021-85628-0011	The princess sat down under a blue canopy with bouquets of roses, and she let Anders sit in a golden chair by her side.
7021-85628-0012	But you must not eat with your cap on your head, she said, and was going to take it off.
7021-85628-0013	the princess certainly was beautiful and he would have dearly liked to be kissed by her but the cap which his mother had made he would not give up on any condition
7021-85628-0014	He only shook his head.
7021-85628-0015	well but now said the princess and she filled his pockets with cakes and put her own heavy gold chain around his neck and bent down and kissed him
7021-85628-0016	"'That is a very fine cap you have,' he said."
7021-85628-0017	"'So it is,' said Anders.
7021-85628-0018	and it is made of mother's best yarn, and she knitted it herself, and everybody wants to get it away from me.
7021-85628-0019	With one jump, Anders got out of his chair.
7021-85628-0020	He darted like an arrow through all the halls, down all the stairs, and across the yard.
7021-85628-0021	He still held onto it with both hands as he rushed into his mother's cottage.
7021-85628-0022	and all his brothers and sisters stood round and listened with their mouths open.
7021-85628-0023	but when his big brother heard that he had refused to give his cap for a king's golden crown he said that anders was a stupid
7021-85628-0024	Anders' face grew red.
7021-85628-0025	But his mother hugged him close.
7021-85628-0026	"'No, my little son,' she said.
7021-85628-0027	If you dressed in silk and gold from top to toe, you could not look any nicer than in your little red cap.
7127-75946-0000	at the conclusion of the banquet which was served at five o'clock the king entered his cabinet where his tailors were awaiting him for the purpose of trying on the celebrated costume representing spring which was the result of so much imagination and had cost so many efforts of thought to the designers and ornament workers of the court
7127-75946-0001	Ah, very well.
7127-75946-0002	let him come in then said the king and as if colbert had been listening at the door for the purpose of keeping himself au courant with the conversation he entered as soon as the king had pronounced his name to the two courtiers
7127-75946-0003	gentlemen do your posts whereupon st aignan and villeroy took their leave
7127-75946-0004	"'Certainly, sire. But I must have money to do that.' "'What?'
7127-75946-0005	"'What do you mean?' inquired Louise.
7127-75946-0006	He has given them with too much grace not to have others still to give, if they are required, which is the case at the present moment.
7127-75946-0007	It is necessary, therefore, that he should comply. The king frowned.
7127-75946-0008	Does your Majesty, then, no longer believe the disloyal attempt?
7127-75946-0009	Not at all. You are, on the contrary, most agreeable to me.
7127-75946-0010	Your Majesty's plan then in this affair is...
7127-75946-0011	"'You will take them from my private treasure.'
7127-75946-0012	the news circulated with the rapidity of lightning during its progress it kindled every variety of coquetry desire and wild ambition
7127-75946-0013	The king had completed his toilet by nine o'clock. He appeared in an open carriage decorated with branches of trees and flowers.
7127-75946-0014	the queens had taken their seats upon a magnificent dais or platform erected upon the borders of the lake in a theatre of wonderful elegance of construction
7127-75946-0015	Suddenly, for the purpose of restoring peace and order, Spring, accompanied by his whole court, made his appearance.
7127-75946-0016	the seasons allies of spring followed him closely to form a quadrille which after many words of more or less flattering import was the commencement of the dance
7127-75946-0017	his legs the best shaped at court were displayed to great advantage in flesh-colored silken hose a silk so fine and so transparent that it seemed almost like flesh itself
7127-75946-0018	There was something in his carriage which resembled the buoyant movements of an immortal, and he did not dance so much as seem to soar along.
7127-75946-0019	Yes, it is suppressed.
7127-75946-0020	"'Far from it, sire. Your Majesty, having given no directions about it, the musicians have retained it.'
7127-75946-0021	"'Yes, sire, and ready dressed for the ballet.'
7127-75946-0022	sire he said your majesty's most devoted servant approaches to perform a service on this occasion with similar zeal that he has already shown on the field of battle
7127-75946-0023	The king seemed only pleased with everyone present.
7127-75946-0024	Monsieur was the only one who did not understand anything about the matter.
7127-75946-0025	The ballet began. The effect was more than beautiful.
7127-75946-0026	when the music by its bursts of melody carried away these illustrious dancers when the simple untutored pantomime of that period only the more natural on account of the very indifferent acting of the august actors had reached its culminating point of triumph the theatre shook with tumultuous applause
7127-75946-0027	disdainful of a success of which madame showed no acknowledgment he thought of nothing but boldly regaining the marked preference of the princess
7127-75946-0028	by degrees all his happiness all his brilliancy subsided into regret and uneasiness so that his limbs lost their power his arms hung heavily by his sides and his head drooped as though he was stupefied
7127-75946-0029	The king, who had from this moment become in reality the principal dancer in the quadrille, cast a look upon his vanquished rival.
7127-75947-0000	every one could observe his agitation and prostration a prostration which was indeed the more remarkable since people were not accustomed to see him with his arms hanging listlessly by his side his head bewildered and his eyes with all their bright intelligence bedimmed
7127-75947-0001	Upon this, Madame deigned to turn her eyes languishingly towards the comte, observing unashamedly
7127-75947-0002	"'Do you think so?' she replied with indifference.
7127-75947-0003	yes the character which your royal highness assumed is in perfect harmony with your own
7127-75947-0004	Explain yourself?
7127-75947-0005	I allude to the goddess.
7127-75947-0006	the princess inquired. No.
7127-75947-0007	She then rose, humming the air to which she was presently going to dance.
7127-75947-0008	The arrow pierced his heart and wounded him mortally.
7127-75947-0009	a quarter of an hour afterwards he returned to the theatre but it will be readily believed that it was only a powerful effort of reason over his great excitement that enabled him to go back or perhaps for love is thus strangely constituted he found it impossible even to remain much longer separated from the presence of one who had broken his heart
7127-75947-0010	when she perceived the young man she rose like a woman surprised in the midst of ideas she was desirous of concealing from herself
7127-75947-0011	"'Remain, I implore you. The evening is most lovely.'
7127-75947-0012	Indeed. Ah!
7127-75947-0013	I remember now, and I congratulate myself. Do you love anyone?
7127-75947-0014	"'Forgive me, I hardly know what I am saying. "'A thousand times forgive me. "'Madame was right, quite right. "'This brutal exile has completely turned my brain.'
7127-75947-0015	There cannot be a doubt he received you kindly, for, in fact, you returned without his permission.
7127-75947-0016	O mademoiselle, why have I not a devoted sister or a true friend such as yourself?
7127-75947-0017	"'What, already here?' they said to her.
7127-75947-0018	"'I have been here this quarter of an hour,' replied Lavallier."
7127-75947-0019	Did not the dancing amuse you? No.
7127-75947-0020	No more than the dancing.
7127-75947-0021	Lavallier is quite a poetess, said Tony Charente.
7127-75947-0022	i am a woman and there are few like me whoever loves me flatters me whoever flatters me pleases me and whoever pleases well said montalais you do not finish
7127-75947-0023	it is too difficult replied mademoiselle d'eternay-charente laughing loudly
7127-75947-0024	Look yonder, do you not see the moon slowly rising, silvering the topmost branches of the chestnuts and the oaks?
7127-75947-0025	exquisite soft turf of the woods the happiness which your friendship confers upon me
7127-75947-0026	Well, said Mademoiselle de Tenechalant, I also think a good deal, but I take care of
7127-75947-0027	to say nothing said montalais so that when mademoiselle de tournay-charente thinks athene is the only one who knows it
7127-75947-0028	"'Quick, quick, then, among the high reed grass,' said Montalais. "'Stoop, Athene, you are so tall!'
7127-75947-0029	The young girls had indeed made themselves small, indeed invisible.
7127-75947-0030	"'She was here just now,' said the count.'
7127-75947-0031	You are positive, then.
7127-75947-0032	Yes, but perhaps I frightened her. In what way?
7127-75947-0033	how is it lavalier said mademoiselle de tenetcharent that the vicomte de bragelonne spoke of you as louise
7127-75947-0034	It seems the king will not consent to it.
7127-75947-0035	"'Good gracious! Has the king any right to interfere in matters of that kind?'
7127-75947-0036	I give my consent.
7127-75947-0037	Oh, I am speaking seriously, replied Montelet, and my opinion in this case is quite as good as the king's, I suppose. Is it not, Louise?
7127-75947-0038	let us run then said all three and gracefully lifting up the long skirts of their silk dresses they lightly ran across the open space between the lake and the thickest covert of the park
7127-75947-0039	in fact the sound of madame's and the queen's carriages could be heard in the distance upon the hard dry ground of the roads followed by the mountain cavaliers
7127-75947-0040	in this way the fete of the whole court was a fete also for the mysterious inhabitants of the forest for certainly the deer in the brake the pheasant on the branch the fox in its hole were all listening
7176-88083-0000	All about him was a tumult of bright and broken color, scattered in broad splashes.
7176-88083-0001	the merganser had a crested head of iridescent green-black a broad collar of lustrous white black back black and white wings white belly sides finely penciled in black and white and a breast of rich chestnut-red streaked with black
7176-88083-0002	his feet were red his long narrow beak with its saw-toothed edges and sharp hooked tip was bright red
7176-88083-0003	but here he was at a terrible disadvantage as compared with the owls hawks and eagles he had no rending claws
7176-88083-0004	But suddenly, straight and swift as a diving cormorant, he shot down into the torrent and disappeared beneath the surface.
7176-88083-0005	Once fairly a wing, however, he wheeled and made back hurriedly for his perch.
7176-88083-0006	It might have seemed that a trout of this size was a fairly substantial meal,
7176-88083-0007	but such was his keenness that even while the wide flukes of his engorged victim were still sticking out at the corners of his beak his fierce red eyes were once more peering downward into the torrent in search of fresh prey
7176-88083-0008	In despair, he hurled himself downward too soon.
7176-88083-0009	The Great Hawk followed hurriedly to retrieve his prey from the ground.
7176-88083-0010	The cat growled softly, picked up the prize in her jaws, and trotted into the bushes to devour it.
7176-88083-0011	in fact he had just finished it the last of the trout's tail had just vanished with a spasm down his strained gullet when the baffled hawk caught sight of him and swooped
7176-88083-0012	The hawk alighted on the dead branch and sat upright, motionless, as if surprised,
7176-88083-0013	like his unfortunate little cousin the teal he too had felt the fear of death smitten into his heart and was heading desperately for the refuge of some dark overhanging bank deep fringed with weeds where the dreadful eye of the hawk should not discern him
7176-88083-0014	The hawk sat upon the branch and watched his quarry swimming beneath the surface.
7176-88083-0015	Almost instantly, he was forced to the top,
7176-88083-0016	Straightway, the hawk glided from his perch and darted after him.
7176-88083-0017	but at this point in the rapids it was impossible for him to stay down.
7176-88083-0018	but this frequenter of the heights of air for all his savage valor was troubled at the leaping waves and the tossing foam of these mad rapids he did not understand them
7176-88083-0019	As he flew, his down-reaching, clutching talons were not half a yard above the fugitive's head.
7176-88083-0020	where the waves for an instant sank they came closer, but not quite within grasping reach.
7176-88083-0021	but as before the leaping waves of the rapids were too much for his pursuer and he was able to flap his way onward in a cloud of foam while doom hung low above his head yet hesitated to strike
7176-88083-0022	the hawk embittered by the loss of his first quarry had become as dogged in pursuit as a weasel not to be shaken off or evaded or deceived
7176-88083-0023	He had a lot of line out, and the place was none too free for a long cast, but he was impatient to drop his flies again on the spot where the big fish was feeding.
7176-88083-0024	The last drop fly, as luck would have it, caught just in the corner of the hawk's angrily open beak, hooking itself firmly.
7176-88083-0025	at the sudden sharp sting of it the great bird turned his head and noticed for the first time the fisherman standing on the bank
7176-88083-0026	The drag upon his beak and the light check upon his wings were inexplicable to him and appalling.
7176-88083-0027	Then the leader parted from the line
7176-92135-0000	he is a welcome figure at the garden parties of the elect who are always ready to encourage him by accepting free seats for his play actor managers nod to him editors allow him to contribute without charge to a symposium on the price of golf balls
7176-92135-0001	In short, he becomes a prominent figure in London society, and if he is not careful, somebody will say so.
7176-92135-0002	But even the unsuccessful dramatist has his moments.
7176-92135-0003	Your play must be not merely a good play, but a successful one.
7176-92135-0004	Frankly, I cannot always say
7176-92135-0005	But suppose you said, I'm fond of writing. My people always say my letters home are good enough for punch.
7176-92135-0006	I've got a little idea for a play about a man and a woman and another woman, and... but perhaps I better keep the plot a secret for the moment.
7176-92135-0007	Anyhow, it's jolly exciting and I can do the dialogue alright.
7176-92135-0008	Lend me your ear for ten minutes, and you shall learn just what stagecraft is.
7176-92135-0009	and I shall begin with a short homily on soliloquy.
7176-92135-0010	Ham, to be or not to be?
7176-92135-0011	Now, the object of this soliloquy is plain,
7176-92135-0012	indeed irresolution being the keynote of hamlet's soliloquy a clever player could to some extent indicate the whole thirty lines by a silent working of the jaw but at the same time it would be idle to deny that he would miss the finer shades of the dramatist's meaning
7176-92135-0013	We moderns, however, see the absurdity of it,
7176-92135-0014	If it be granted, first, that the thoughts of a certain character should be known to the audience, and secondly, that soliloquy, or the habit of thinking aloud, is in opposition to modern stage technique, how shall soliloquy be avoided without damage to the play?
7176-92135-0015	And so on, till you get to the end when Ophelia might say, ah yes, or something non-committal of that sort.
7176-92135-0016	This would be an easy way of doing it, but it would not be the best way, for the reason that it is too easy to call attention to itself.
7176-92135-0017	In the old badly made play, it was frequently necessary for one of the characters to take the audience into his confidence.
7176-92135-0018	In the modern, well-constructed play, he simply rings up an imaginary confederate and tells him what he is going to do. Could anything be more natural?
7176-92135-0019	I want double nine. Hello?
7176-92135-0020	Double nine two three, Elsinore. Double not, yes. Hello, is that you, Horatio? Hamlet speaking.
7176-92135-0021	I say, I've been wondering about this business.
7176-92135-0022	To be or not to be, that is the question. Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows. What? No, Hamlet speaking.
7176-92135-0023	You gave me double five. I want double nine. Hello, is that you Horatio? Hamlet speaking.
7176-92135-0024	To be or not to be, that is the question. Whether tis nobler...
7176-92135-0025	It is to let Hamlet, if that happened to be the name of your character, enter with a small dog, pet falcon, mongoose, tame bear, or whatever animal is most in keeping with the part, and confide in this animal such sorrows, hopes, or secret history as the audience has got to know.
7176-92135-0026	Enter Hamlet with his favorite boar hound,
7176-92135-0027	Lady Larkspur starts suddenly and turns toward him.
7176-92135-0028	Larkspur bit me again this morning for the third time.
7176-92135-0029	I want to get away from it all. Swoon.
7176-92135-0030	Enter Lord Arthur Fluffanose,
7176-92135-0031	And there you are. You will of course appreciate that the unfinished sentences not only save time, but also make the maneuvering very much more natural.
7176-92135-0032	how you may be wondering are you to begin your masterpiece.
7176-92135-0033	relapses into silence for the rest of the evening
7176-92135-0034	The Duchess of Southbridge to Lord Reggie. Oh, Reggie, what did you say?
7176-92135-0035	Then Lord Tupany, well, what about auction?
7176-92135-0036	The crowd drifts off, leaving the hero and heroine alone in the middle of the stage. And then you can begin.
7176-92135-0037	Then is the time to introduce a meal on the stage.
7176-92135-0038	A stage meal is popular because it proves to the audience that the actors, even one called Charles Holtry or Owen Nairs, are real people just like you and me.
7176-92135-0039	Tea, please, Matthews. Butler, impassively.
7176-92135-0040	hostess replaces lump and inclines empty teapot over tray for a moment then hands him a cup painted brown inside thus deceiving the gentleman with the telescope in the upper circle
7176-92135-0041	Re-enter Butler and three footmen who removed the tea things. Hostess to guest.
7176-92135-0042	In novels, the hero has often pushed his meals away untasted, but no steed hero would do anything so unnatural as this.
7176-92135-0043	two bites are made and the bread is crumbled with an air of great eagerness indeed one feels that in real life the guest would clutch hold of the footman and say half a mold chap i haven't nearly finished but the actor is better schooled than this
7176-92135-0044	But it is the cigarette which chiefly has brought the modern drama to its present state of perfection.
7176-92135-0045	Lord John, taking out Gold's cigarette case from his left-hand upper waistcoat pocket,
7729-102255-0000	The bogus legislature numbered 36 members.
7729-102255-0001	This was at the March election, 1855.
7729-102255-0002	That summer's immigration, however, being mainly from the Free States, greatly changed the relative strengths of the two parties.
7729-102255-0003	for general service therefore requiring no special effort the numerical strength of the factions was about equal while on extraordinary occasions the two thousand border ruffian reserve lying a little farther back from the state line could at any time easily turn the scale
7729-102255-0004	the free state men had only their convictions their intelligence their courage and the moral support of the north the conspiracy had its secret combination the territorial officials the legislature the bogus laws the courts the militia officers the president and the army
7729-102255-0005	This was a formable array of advantages. Slavery was playing with loaded dice.
7729-102255-0006	coming by way of the missouri river towns he fell first among border ruffian companionship and influences and perhaps having his inclinations already molded by his washington instructions his early impressions were decidedly adverse to the free state cause
7729-102255-0007	his reception speech at westport in which he maintained the legality of the legislature and his determination to enforce their laws delighted his pro-slavery auditors
7729-102255-0008	all the territorial dignitaries were present governor shannon presided john calhoun the surveyor-general made the principal speech a denunciation of the abolitionists supporting the topeka movement chief justice lecomte dignified the occasion with approving remarks
7729-102255-0009	all dissent all non-compliance all hesitation all mere silence even were in their stronghold towns like leavenworth branded as abolitionism declared to be hostility to the public welfare and punished with proscription personal violence expulsion and frequently death
7729-102255-0010	of the lynchings the mobs and the murders it would be impossible except in a very extended work to note the frequent and atrocious details
7729-102255-0011	the present chapters can only touch upon the more salient movements of the civil war in kansas which happily are not sanguinary if however the individual and more isolated cases of bloodshed could be described they would show a startling aggregate of barbarity and a loss of life for opinion's sake
7729-102255-0012	Several hundred Free State men promptly responded to the summons.
7729-102255-0013	It was, in fact, the best weapon of its day.
7729-102255-0014	The leaders of the conspiracy became distrustful of their power to crush the town.
7729-102255-0015	one of his militia generals suggested that the governor should require the outlaws at lawrence and elsewhere to surrender the sharps rifles another wrote asking him to call out the government troops at fort leavenworth
7729-102255-0016	the governor on his part becoming doubtful of the legality of employing missouri militia to enforce kansas laws was also eager to secure the help of federal troops
7729-102255-0017	sheriff jones had his pockets always full of writs issued in the spirit of persecution but was often baffled by the sharp wits and ready resources of the free state people and sometimes defied outright
7729-102255-0018	little by little however the latter became hemmed and bound in the meshes of the various devices and proceedings which the territorial officials evolved from the bogus laws
7729-102255-0019	to embarrass this damaging exposure judge lecomte issued a writ against the ex-governor on a frivolous charge of contempt
7729-102255-0020	the incident was not violent nor even dramatic no posse was summoned no further effort made and reader fearing personal violence soon fled in disguise
7729-102255-0021	but the affair was magnified as a crowning proof that the free state men were insurrectionists and outlaws
7729-102255-0022	from these again sprang barricaded and fortified dwellings camps and scout parties finally culminating in roving guerrilla bands half partisan half predatory
7729-102255-0023	Their distinctive characters, however, display one broad and unfailing difference.
7729-102255-0024	the free state men clung to their prairie towns and prairie ravines with all the obstinacy and courage of true defenders of their homes and firesides
7729-102255-0025	Their assumed character changed with their changing opportunities or necessities.
7729-102255-0026	in the shooting of sheriff jones in lawrence and in the refusal of ex-governor reader to allow the deputy marshal to arrest him they discovered grave offenses against the territorial and united states laws
7729-102255-0027	Footnote. Sumner to Shannon. May 12, 1856.
7729-102255-0028	private persons who had leased the free state hotel vainly besought the various authorities to present the destruction of their property
7729-102255-0029	Ten days were consumed in these negotiations, but the spirit of vengeance refused to yield.
7729-102255-0030	He summoned half a dozen citizens to join his posse, who followed, obeyed, and assisted him.
7729-102255-0031	He continued his pretended search, and to give colour to his errand, made two arrests.
7729-102255-0032	the free state hotel a stone building in dimensions fifty by seventy feet three stories high and handsomely furnished previously occupied only for lodging rooms on that day for the first time opened its table accommodations to the public and provided a free dinner in honor of the occasion
7729-102255-0033	As he had promised to protect the hotel, the reassured citizens began to laugh at their own fears.
7729-102255-0034	To their sorrow they were soon undeceived.
7729-102255-0035	The military force, partly rabble, partly organized, had meanwhile moved into the town.
7729-102255-0036	He planted a company before the hotel and demanded a surrender of the arms belonging to the Free State Military Companies.
7729-102255-0037	half an hour later turning a deaf ear to all remonstrance he gave the proprietors until five o'clock to remove their families and personal property from the free state hotel
7729-102255-0038	Atchison, who had been haranguing the mob, planted his two guns before the building and trained them upon it.
7729-102255-0039	the inmates being removed at the appointed hour a few cannon balls were fired through the stone walls
7729-102255-0040	in this incident contrasting the creative and the destructive spirit of the factions the immigrant aid society of massachusetts finds its most honorable and triumphant vindication
7729-102255-0041	the whole proceeding was so childish the miserable plot so transparent the outrage so gross as to bring disgust to the better class of border ruffians who were witnesses and accessories
7729-102255-0042	relocated footnote governor robinson being on his way east the steamboat on which he was traveling stopped at lexington mo
7729-102255-0043	in a few days an officer came with a requisition from governor shannon and took the prisoner by land of westport and afterwards from there to kansas city and leavenworth
7729-102255-0044	here he was placed in the custody of captain martin of the kickapoo rangers who proved a kind jailer and materially assisted in protecting him from the dangerous intentions of the mob which at that time held leavenworth under the reign of terror
7729-102255-0045	Captain Martin said, I shall give you a pistol to help protect yourself if worse comes to worst.
7729-102255-0046	in the early morning of the next day may twenty ninth a company of dragoons with one empty saddle came down from the fort and while the pro-slavery men still slept the prisoner and his escort were on their way across the prairies to lecompton in the charge of officers of the united states army
8224-274381-0000	though thrown into prison for this enterprise and detained some time he was not discouraged but still continued by his countenance and protection to infuse spirit into the distressed royalists
8224-274381-0001	among other persons of distinction who united themselves to him was lord napier of murchiston son of the famous inventor of the logarithms the person to whom the title of a great man is more justly due than to any other whom his country ever produced
8224-274381-0002	while the former foretold that the scottish covenanters were secretly forming a union with the english parliament and inculcated the necessity of preventing them by some vigorous undertaking the latter still insisted that every such attempt would precipitate them into measures to which otherwise they were not perhaps inclined
8224-274381-0003	the king's ears were now open to montrose's counsels who proposed none but the boldest and most daring agreeably to the desperate state of the royal cause in scotland
8224-274381-0004	Five hundred men more, who had been levied by the Covenanters, were persuaded to embrace the royal cause, and with this combined force he hastened to attack Lord Elcho, who lay at Perth with an army of six thousand men, assembled upon the first news of the Irish invasion.
8224-274381-0005	dreading the superior power of argyll who having joined his vassals to a force levied by the public was approaching with a considerable army montrose hastened northward in order to rouse again the marquis of huntly and the gordons who having before hastily taken arms had been instantly suppressed by the covenanters
8224-274381-0006	this nobleman's character though celebrated for political courage and conduct was very low for military prowess and after some skirmishes in which he was worsted he here allowed montrose to escape him
8224-274381-0007	by quick marches through these inaccessible mountains that general freed himself from the superior forces of the covenanters
8224-274381-0008	with these and some reinforcements of the atholl men and macdonalds whom he had recalled montrose fell suddenly upon argyll's country and let loose upon it all the rage of war carrying off the cattle burning the houses and putting the inhabitants to the sword
8224-274381-0009	this severity by which montrose sullied his victories was the result of private animosity against the chieftain as much as of zeal for the public cause argyll collecting three thousand men marched in quest of the enemy who had retired with their plunder and he lay at innerlochy supposing himself still at a considerable distance from them
8224-274381-0010	by a quick and unexpected march montrose hastened to inner lockie and presented himself in order of battle before the surprised but not affrighted covenanters
8224-274381-0011	His conduct and presence of mind in this emergence appeared conspicuous,
8224-274381-0012	montrose weak in cavalry here lined his troops of horse with infantry and after putting the enemy's horse to rout fell with united force upon their foot who were entirely cut in pieces though with the loss of the gallant lord gordon on the part of the royalists
8224-274381-0013	from the same men new regiments and new companies were formed different officers appointed and the whole military force put into such hands as the independents could rely on
8224-274381-0014	besides members of parliament who were excluded many officers unwilling to serve under the new generals threw up their commissions and unwarily facilitated the project of putting the army entirely into the hands of that faction
8224-274381-0015	though the discipline of the former parliamentary army was not contemptible a more exact plan was introduced and rigorously executed by these new commanders
8224-274381-0016	valour indeed was very generally diffused over the one party as well as the other during this period discipline also was attained by the forces of the parliament but the perfection of the military art in concerting the general plans of action and the operations of the field seems still on both sides to have been in a great measure wanting
8224-274381-0017	historians at least perhaps from their own ignorance and inexperience have not remarked any thing but a headlong impetuous conduct each party hurrying to a battle where valor and fortune chiefly determine the success
8224-274384-0000	he passed through henley st albans and came so near to london as harrow on the hill
8224-274384-0001	the scottish generals and commissioners effected great surprise on the appearance of the king and though they paid him all the exterior respect due to his dignity they instantly set a guard upon him under colour of protection and made him in reality a prisoner
8224-274384-0002	they informed the english parliament of this unexpected incident and assured them that they had entered into no private treaty with the king
8224-274384-0003	Or hath he given us any gift?
8224-274384-0004	and the men of israel answered the men of judah and said we have ten parts in the king and we have also more right in david than ye why then did ye despise us that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king
8224-274384-0005	another preacher after reproaching him to his face with his misgovernment ordered this psalm to be sung
8224-274384-0006	The king stood up and called for that psalm which begins with these words,
8224-274384-0007	Have mercy, Lord, on me, I pray, for men would me devour.
8224-274384-0008	the good-natured audience in pity to fallen majesty showed for once greater deference to the king than to the minister and sung the psalm which the former had called for
8224-274384-0009	The Parliament and the Scots laid their proposals before the King.
8224-274384-0010	before the settlement of terms the administration must be possessed entirely by the parliaments of both kingdoms and how incompatible that scheme with the liberty of the king is easily imagined
8224-274384-0011	the english it is evident had they not been previously assured of receiving the king would never have parted with so considerable a sum and while they weakened themselves by the same measure have strengthened a people with whom they must afterwards have so material an interest to discuss
8224-274384-0012	if any still retained rancor against him in his present condition they passed in silence while his well-wishers more generous than prudent accompanied his march with tears with acclamations and with prayers for his safety
8224-274384-0013	His death, in this conjuncture, was a public misfortune.
8230-279154-0000	The analysis of knowledge will occupy us until the end of the thirteenth lecture, and is the most difficult part of our whole enterprise.
8230-279154-0001	what is called perception differs from sensation by the fact that the sensational ingredients bring up habitual associates images and expectations of their usual correlates all of which are subjectively indistinguishable from the sensation
8230-279154-0002	whether or not this principle is liable to exceptions every one would agree that it has a broad measure of truth though the word exactly might seem an overstatement and it might seem more correct to say that ideas approximately represent impressions
8230-279154-0003	And what sort of evidence is logically possible?
8230-279154-0004	there is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world sprang into being five minutes ago exactly as it then was with a population that remembered a wholly unreal past
8230-279154-0005	All that I am doing is to use its logical tunability as a help in the analysis of what occurs when we remember.
8230-279154-0006	The behaviorist who attempts to make psychology a record of behavior has to trust his memory in making the record.
8230-279154-0007	Habit is a concept involving the occurrence of similar events at different times. If the behaviorist feels confident that there is such a phenomenon as habit, that can only be because he trusts his memory, when it assures him that there have been other times.
8230-279154-0008	But I do not think such an inference is warranted.
8230-279154-0009	Our confidence or lack of confidence in the accuracy of a memory image must, in fundamental cases, be based upon a characteristic of the image itself, since we cannot evoke the past bodily and compare it with the present image.
8230-279154-0010	We sometimes have images that are by no means peculiarly vague, which yet we do not trust. For example, under the influence of fatigue, we may see a friend's face vividly and clearly, but horribly distorted.
8230-279154-0011	Some images, like some sensations, feel very familiar while others feel strange.
8230-279154-0012	Familiarity is a feeling capable of degrees.
8230-279154-0013	In an image of a well-known face, for example, some parts may feel more familiar than others. When this happens, we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar parts than in that of the unfamiliar parts.
8230-279154-0014	I come now to the other characteristic which memory images must have in order to account for our knowledge of the past.
8230-279154-0015	They must have some characteristic, which makes us regard them as referring to more or less remote portions of the past.
8230-279154-0016	In actual fact, there are doubtless various factors that concur in giving us the feeling of greater or less remoteness in some remembered event.
8230-279154-0017	There may be a specific feeling, which could be called the feeling of pastness, especially where immediate memory is concerned.
8230-279154-0018	There is, of course, a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present and knowing the time order of two remembered events.
8230-279154-0019	it would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of feelings giving their temporal relation to the present but it is clear that such feelings must play an essential part in the process of dating remembered events
8230-279154-0020	If we had retained the subject or act in knowledge, the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple.
8230-279154-0021	Remembering has to be a present occurrence in some way resembling or related to what is remembered.
8230-279154-0022	Some points may be taken as fixed and, such as any theory of memory, must arrive at.
8230-279154-0023	In this case, as in most others, what may be taken as certain in advance is rather vague.
8230-279154-0024	The first of our vague but indubitable data is that there is knowledge of the past.
8230-279154-0025	we might provisionally though perhaps not quite correctly define memory as that way of knowing about the past which has no analogue in our knowledge of the future such a definition would at least serve to mark the problem with which we are concerned though some expectations may deserve to rank with memory as regards immediacy
8230-279154-0026	This distinction is vital to the understanding of memory, but it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory.
8230-279154-0027	A gramophone, by the help of suitable records, might relate to us the incidents of its past, and people are not so different from gramophones as they like to believe.
8230-279154-0028	I can set to work now to remember things I never remembered before, such as what I had to eat for breakfast this morning, and it can hardly be holy habit that enables me to do this.
8230-279154-0029	The fact that a man can recite a poem does not show that he remembers any previous occasion on which he has recited or read it.
8230-279154-0030	Simmons' two books, mentioned in an earlier lecture, do not touch knowledge memory at all closely.
8230-279154-0031	they give laws according to which images of past occurrences come into our minds but do not discuss our belief that these images refer to past occurrences which is what constitutes knowledge memory
8230-279154-0032	It is this that is of interest to Theory of Knowledge.
8230-279154-0033	It is by no means always reliable. Almost everybody has, at some time, experienced the well-known illusion that all that is happening now happened before at some time.
8230-279154-0034	Whenever the sense of familiarity occurs without a definite object, it leads us to search the environment until we are satisfied that we have found the appropriate object, which leads us to the judgment, this is familiar.
8230-279154-0035	Thus, no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the feeling of familiarity alone.
8230-279154-0036	A further stage is recognition.
8230-279154-0037	Recognition in this sense does not necessarily involve more than a habit of association. The kind of object we are seeing at the moment is associated with the word cat or with an auditory image of purring or whatever other characteristic we may happen to recognize in the cat of the moment.
8230-279154-0038	We are, of course, in fact, able to judge when we recognize an object that we have seen it before, but this judgment is something over and above recognition in this first sense, and may very probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition in this first sense of the word.
8230-279154-0039	This knowledge is memory in one sense, though in another it is not.
8230-279154-0040	there are however several points in which such an account of recognition is inadequate to begin with it might seem at first sight more correct to define recognition as i have seen this before than as this has existed before
8230-279154-0041	The definition of my experience is difficult. Broadly speaking, it is everything that is connected with what I am experiencing now by certain links, of which the various forms of memory are among the most important.
8230-279154-0042	Thus, if I recognize a thing, the occasion of its previous existence in virtue of which I recognize it forms part of my experience, by definition. Recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is singled out from the rest of the world.
8230-279154-0043	Of course, the words, this has existed before, are a very inadequate translation of what actually happens when we form a judgment of recognition, but that is unavoidable. Words are framed to express a level of thought which is by no means primitive, and are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as recognition.
8455-210777-0000	I remained there alone for many hours, but I must acknowledge that before I left the chambers I had gradually brought myself to look at the matter in another light.
8455-210777-0001	had eva cressweller not been good-looking had jack been still at college had sir kennington oval remained in england had mr bunnet and the barkeeper not succeeded in stopping my carriage on the hill should i have succeeded in arranging for the final departure of my old friend
8455-210777-0002	On arriving at home at my own residence, I found that our salon was filled with a brilliant company.
8455-210777-0003	as i spoke i made him a gracious bow and i think i showed him by my mode of address that i did not bear any grudge as to my individual self
8455-210777-0004	I have come to your shores, Mr. President, with the purpose of seeing how things are progressing in this distant quarter of the world.
8455-210777-0005	We have our little struggles here as elsewhere, and all things cannot be done by Rosewater.
8455-210777-0006	"'We are quite satisfied now, Captain Battleaxe,' said my wife."
8455-210777-0007	"'Quite satisfied,' said Eva.
8455-210777-0008	the ladies in compliance with that softness of heart which is their characteristic are on one side and the men by whom the world has to be managed are on the other
8455-210777-0009	No doubt, in process of time, the ladies will follow.
8455-210777-0010	"'Their masters,' said Mrs. Neverbend.
8455-210777-0011	I did not mean, said Captain Battleaxe, to touch upon public subjects at such a moment as this.
8455-210777-0012	Mrs. Neverbend, you must indeed be proud of your son.
8455-210777-0013	Jack had been standing in the far corner of the room talking to Eva, and was now reduced to silence by his praises.
8455-210777-0014	"'Sir Kennington Oval is a very fine player,' said my wife.'
8455-210777-0015	I, and my wife and son and the two Cresswellers, and three or four others, agreed to dine on board the ship on the next.
8455-210777-0016	this i felt was paid to me as being president of the republic and i endeavored to behave myself with such mingled humility and dignity as might befit the occasion but i could not but feel that something was wanting to the simplicity of my ordinary life
8455-210777-0017	My wife, on the spur of the moment, managed to give the gentleman a very good dinner.
8455-210777-0018	This, she said, was true hospitality, and I am not sure that I did not agree with her.
8455-210777-0019	then there were three or four leading men of the community with their wives who were for the most part the fathers and mothers of the young ladies
8455-210777-0020	"'Oh, yes,' said Jack. "'And I'm nowhere.'
8455-210777-0021	But I mean to have my innings before long.
8455-210777-0022	of what mrs neverbend had gone through in providing birds beasts and fishes not to talk of tarts and jellies for the dinner of that day no one but myself can have any idea but it must be admitted that she accomplished her task with thorough success
8455-210777-0023	We sat with the officers some little time after dinner, and then went ashore.
8455-210777-0024	How much of evil, of real accomplished evil, had there not occurred to me during the last few days?'
8455-210777-0025	What could I do now but just lay myself down and die?
8455-210777-0026	And the death of which I dreamt could not, alas!
8455-210777-0027	when this captain should have taken himself and his vessel back to england i would retire to a small farm which i possessed at the further side of the island and there in seclusion would i end my days
8455-210777-0028	Jack would become Eva's happy husband and would remain amidst the hurried duties of the eager world.
8455-210777-0029	Thinking of all this, I went to sleep.
8455-210777-0030	mr neverbend began the captain and i observed that up to that moment he had generally addressed me as president it cannot be denied that we have come here on an unpleasant mission
8455-210777-0031	You have received us with all that courtesy and hospitality for which your character in England stands so high.
8455-210777-0032	"'It is a duty,' said I.
8455-210777-0033	But your power is so superior to any that I can advance, as to make us here feel that there is no disgrace in yielding to it.
8455-210777-0034	Not a doubt, but had your force been only double or trouble our own, I should have found it my duty to struggle with you.
8455-210777-0035	"'That is all quite true, Mr. Neverbend,' said Sir Ferdinando Brown.
8455-210777-0036	i can afford to smile because i am absolutely powerless before you but i do not the less feel that in a matter of which the progress of the world is concerned i or rather we have been put down by brute force
8455-210777-0037	You have come to us threatening us with absolute destruction.
8455-210777-0038	therefore i feel myself quite able as president of this republic to receive you with a courtesy due to the servants of a friendly ally
8455-210777-0039	I can assure you he has not even allowed me to see the trigger since I have been on board.
8455-210777-0040	"'Then,' said Sir Ferdinando, "'there is nothing for it but that we must take you with him.'
8455-210777-0041	There came upon me a sudden shock when I heard these words, which exceeded anything which I had yet felt.
8455-210777-0042	"'You hear what Sir Ferdinand O'Brown has said,' replied Captain Battleaxe.
8455-210777-0043	"'But what is the delicate mission?' I asked.
8455-210777-0044	I was to be taken away and carried to England, or elsewhere, or drowned upon the voyage, it mattered not which.
8455-210777-0045	then the republic of britain eula was to be declared as non-existent and the british flag was to be exalted and a british governor installed in the executive chambers
8455-210777-0046	you may be quite sure it's there said captain battle-axe and that i can so use it as to half obliterate your town within two minutes of my return on board
8455-210777-0047	"'You propose to kidnap me,' I said.'
8455-210777-0048	What would become of your gun were I to kidnap you?
8455-210777-0049	Lieutenant Crosstrees is a very gallant officer.
8455-210777-0050	One of us always remains on board while the other is on shore.
8455-210777-0051	what world-wide iniquity such a speech as that discloses said i still turning myself to the captain for though i would have crushed them both by my words had it been possible my dislike centred itself on sir ferdinando
8455-210777-0052	"'You will allow me to suggest,' said he, "'that that is a matter of opinion.'
8455-210777-0053	Were I to comply with your orders without expressing my own opinion, I should seem to have done so willingly hereafter.
8455-210777-0054	The letter ran as follows.
8455-210777-0055	sir i have it in command to inform your excellency that you have been appointed governor of the crown colony which is called britain eula
8455-210777-0056	The peculiar circumstances of the colony are within your excellency's knowledge.
8455-210777-0057	but in their selection of a constitution the briton newlists have unfortunately allowed themselves but one deliberate assembly and hence have sprung their present difficulties
8455-210777-0058	It is founded on the acknowledged weakness of those who survive that period of life at which men cease to work.
8455-210777-0059	but it is surmised that you will find difficulties in the way of your entering at once upon your governor.
8455-210777-0060	The John Bright is armed with a weapon of great power, against which it is impossible that the people of Britain Eula should prevail.
8455-210777-0061	you will carry out with you one hundred men of the north-northwest birmingham regiment which will probably suffice for your own security as it is thought that if mr neverbend be withdrawn the people will revert easily to their old habits of obedience
8455-210777-0062	When do you intend that the John Bright shall start?
8455-210777-0063	"'Today?' I shouted.
8455-210777-0064	and I have no one ready to whom I can give up the archives of the government.
8455-210777-0065	"'I shall be happy to take charge of them,' said Sir Ferdinando."
8455-210777-0066	They, of course, must all be altered.
8455-210777-0067	or of the habits of our people. It is quite impossible.
8455-210777-0068	''Your power is sufficient,'' I said.
8455-210777-0069	If you will give us your promise to meet Captain Badalax here at this time tomorrow, we will stretch a point and delay the departure of the John Bright for twenty-four hours.
8455-210777-0070	And this plan was adopted too, in order to extract from me a promise that I would depart in peace.
8463-287645-0000	this was what did the mischief so far as the running away was concerned
8463-287645-0001	It is hardly necessary to say more of them here.
8463-287645-0002	from the manner in which he expressed himself with regard to robert holland no man in the whole range of his recollections will be longer remembered than he his enthralment while under holland will hardly ever be forgotten
8463-287645-0003	of this party edward a boy of seventeen called forth much sympathy he too was claimed by holland
8463-287645-0004	John Wesley Combash, Jacob Taylor, and Thomas Edward Skinner.
8463-287645-0005	a few years back one of their slaves a coachman was kept on the coach-box one cold night when they were out at a ball until he became almost frozen to death in fact he did die in the infirmary from the effects of the frost about one week afterwards
8463-287645-0006	the doctor who attended the injured creature in this case was simply told that she slipped and fell down the stairs as she was coming down
8463-287645-0007	another case said john wesley was a little girl half grown who was washing windows upstairs one day and unluckily fell asleep in the window and in this position was found by her mistress in a rage the mistress hit her a heavy slap knocked her out of the window and she fell to the pavement and died in a few hours from the effects thereof
8463-287645-0008	As usual, nothing was done in the way of punishment.
8463-287645-0009	I never knew of but one man who could ever please him.
8463-287645-0010	He worked me very hard. He wanted to be beating me all the time.
8463-287645-0011	She was a large, homely woman. They were common white people, with no reputation in the community.
8463-287645-0012	Substantially, this was Jacob's unvarnished description of his master and mistress.
8463-287645-0013	as to his age and also the name of his master jacob's statement varied somewhat from the advertisement
8463-287645-0014	of starting. I didn't know the way to come.
8463-294825-0000	it's almost beyond conjecture.
8463-294825-0001	This reality begins to explain the dark power and otherworldly fascination of 20,000 leagues under the seas.
8463-294825-0002	first as a paris stockbroker later as a celebrated author and yachtsman he went on frequent voyages to britain america the mediterranean
8463-294825-0003	nemo builds a fabulous futuristic submarine the nautilus then conducts an under-water campaign of vengeance against his imperialist oppressor
8463-294825-0004	In all, the novel had a difficult gestation.
8463-294825-0005	Other subtleties occur inside each episode, the textures sparkling with wit, information, and insight.
8463-294825-0006	his specifications for an open-sea submarine and a self-containing diving suit were decades before their time yet modern technology bears them out triumphantly
8463-294825-0007	even the supporting cast is shrewdly drawn professor aranax the career scientist caught in an ethical conflict conseil the compulsive classifier who supplies humorous tag-lines for verne's fast facts the harpooner ned land a creature of constant appetites man as heroic animal
8463-294825-0008	But much of the novel's brooding power comes from Captain Nemo.
8463-294825-0009	this compulsion leads nemo into ugly contradictions he is a fighter for freedom yet all who board his ship are imprisoned there for good he works to save lives both human and animal yet he himself creates a holocaust he detests imperialism yet he lays personal claim to the south pole
8463-294825-0010	and in this last action he falls into the classic sin of pride.
8463-294825-0011	He is swiftly punished.
8463-294825-0012	The Nautilus nearly perishes in the Antarctic and Nemo sinks into a growing depression.
8463-294825-0013	for many then this book has been a source of fascination surely one of the most influential novels ever written and inspiration for such scientists and discoverers as engineer simon lake oceanographer william b b polar traveler sir ernest shackleton

8463-294828-0000	Chapter 3 As Master Wishes
8463-294828-0001	three seconds before the arrival of j b hobson's letter i no more dreamed of chasing the unicorn than of trying for the northwest passage
8463-294828-0002	Even so, I had just returned from an arduous journey, exhausted and badly needing a rest.
8463-294828-0003	i wanted nothing more than to see my country again my friends my modest quarters by the botanical gardens my dearly beloved collections
8463-294828-0004	but now nothing could hold me back.
8463-294828-0005	"'Cossé was my man's servant.'"
8463-294828-0006	From rubbing shoulders with scientists in our little universe by the botanical gardens, the boy had come to know a thing or two.
8463-294828-0007	classifying was everything to him so he knew nothing else well versed in the theory of classification he was poorly versed in its practical application and i doubt that he could tell a sperm whale from a baleen whale
8463-294828-0008	"'and yet what a fine, gallant lad!'
8463-294828-0009	not once did he comment on the length or the hardships of the journey
8463-294828-0010	never did he object to buckling up his suit-case for any country whatever china or the congo no matter how far off it was
8463-294828-0011	he went here there and everywhere in perfect contentment
8463-294828-0012	Please forgive me for this underhanded way of admitting that I had turned forty.
8463-294828-0013	he was a fanatic on formality and he only addressed me in the third person to the point where it got tiresome
8463-294828-0014	There was good reason to stop and think, even for the world's most emotionless man.
8463-294828-0015	Conseil! I called a third time. Conseil appeared.
8463-294828-0016	"'Did Master summon me?' he said, entering.
8463-294828-0017	pack as much into my trunk as you can my traveling kit my suits shirts and socks don't bother counting just squeeze it all in and hurry
8463-294828-0018	We'll deal with them later. What?
8463-294828-0019	Anyhow, we'll leave instructions to ship the whole menagerie to France.
8463-294828-0020	yes we are certainly i replied evasively but after we make a detour
8463-294828-0021	A route slightly less direct, that's all.
8463-294828-0022	We're leaving on the Abraham Lincoln.
8463-294828-0023	You see, my friend, it's an issue of the monster, the notorious narwhal.
8463-294828-0024	We don't know where it will take us.
8463-294828-0025	but we're going just the same.
8463-294828-0026	We have a commander who's game for anything.
8463-294828-0027	I left instructions for shipping my containers of stuffed animals and dried plants to Paris, France.
8463-294828-0028	i opened a line of credit sufficient to cover the barbaroussa and conseil at my heels i jumped into a carriage
8463-294828-0029	Our baggage was immediately carried to the deck of the frigate. I rushed aboard.
8463-294828-0030	I asked for Commander Farragut.
8463-294828-0031	One of the sailors led me to the after-deck, where I stood in the presence of a smart-looking officer who extended his hand to me.
8463-294828-0032	In person, welcome aboard, Professor. Your cabin is waiting for you.
8463-294828-0033	i was well satisfied with my cabin which was located in the stern and opened into the officer's mess
8463-294828-0034	We'll be quite comfortable here, I told Conce.
8463-294828-0035	and so if i had been delayed by a quarter of an hour or even less the frigate would have gone without me and i would have missed out on this unearthly extraordinary and inconceivable expedition whose true story might well meet with some scepticism
8463-294828-0036	The wharves of Brooklyn and every part of New York bordering the East River were crowded with curiosity seekers.
8463-294828-0037	departing from five hundred thousand throats three cheers burst forth in succession
8463-294828-0038	thousands of handkerchiefs were waving above these tightly packed masses hailing the abraham lincoln until it reached the waters of the hudson river at the tip of the long peninsula that forms new york city
8555-284447-0000	then he rushed downstairs into the courtyard shouting loudly for his soldiers and threatening to patch everybody in his dominions if the sailor-man was not recaptured
8555-284447-0001	hold him fast my men and as soon as i've had my coffee and oatmeal i'll take him to the room of the great knife and patch him
8555-284447-0002	i wouldn't mind a cup of coffee myself said captain bill i've had considerable exercise this morning and i'm all ready for breakfast
8555-284447-0003	but cap'n bill made no such attempt knowing it would be useless
8555-284447-0004	as soon as they entered the room of the great knife the boolaroo gave a yell of disappointment
8555-284447-0005	the room of the great knife was high and big and around it ran rows of benches for the spectators to sit upon
8555-284447-0006	in one place at the head of the room was a raised platform for the royal family with elegant throne chairs for the king and queen and six smaller but richly upholstered chairs for the snub-nosed princesses
8555-284447-0007	therefore her majesty paid no attention to any one and no one paid any attention to her
8555-284447-0008	rich jewels of blue stones glittered upon their persons and the royal ladies were fully as gorgeous as they were haughty and overbearing
8555-284447-0009	Morning, girls. Hope you feel as well as you look.
8555-284447-0010	control yourselves my dears replied the boolaroo the worst punishment i know how to inflict on any one this prisoner is about to suffer you will see a very pretty patching my royal daughters
8555-284447-0011	suppose it's a friend
8555-284447-0012	The captain shook his head.
8555-284447-0013	why you said to fetch the first living crittur we met and that was the spilly goat replied the captain panting hard as he held fast to one of the goat's horns
8555-284447-0014	the idea of patching cap'n bill to a goat was vastly amusing to him and the more he thought of it the more he roared with laughter
8555-284447-0015	they look something alike you know suggested the captain of the guards looking from one to the other doubtfully and they're nearly the same size if you stand the goat on his hind legs they've both got the same style of whiskers and they're both of them obstinate and dangerous so they ought to make a good patch splendid
8555-284447-0016	Fine. Glorious.
8555-284447-0017	when this had been accomplished the boolaroo leaned over to try to discover why the frame rolled away seemingly of its own accord and he was the more puzzled because it had never done such a thing before
8555-284447-0018	At once the goat gave a leap, escaped from the soldiers, and with bowed head rushed upon the bularoo.
8555-284447-0019	before any could stop him he butted his majesty so furiously that the king soared far into the air and tumbled in a heap among the benches where he lay moaning and groaning
8555-284447-0020	The goat's warlike spirit was roused by this successful attack,
8555-284447-0021	then they sped in great haste for the door and the goat gave a final butt that sent the row of royal ladies all diving into the corridor in another tangle whereupon they shrieked in a manner that terrified every one within sound of their voices
8555-284447-0022	"'I had a notion it was you, mate, that saved me from the knife.'
8555-284447-0023	"'I couldn't shiver much being bound so tight, "'but when I'm loose, I mean to have just one good shiver to relieve my feelings.'
8555-284447-0024	come and get the boolaroo she said going toward the benches
8555-284449-0000	so they were quite willing to obey the orders of their girl queen and in a short time the blast of trumpets and roll of drums and clashing of cymbals told trot and cap'n bill that the blue bands had assembled before the palace
8555-284449-0001	then they all marched out a little way into the fields and found that the army of pinkies had already formed and was advancing steadily toward them
8555-284449-0002	at the head of the pinkies were gipkisizzle and button bright who had the parrot on his shoulder and they were supported by captain coralie and captain tintin and rosalie the witch
8555-284449-0003	when the blueskins saw gitgesissel they raised another great shout for he was the favourite of the soldiers and very popular with all the people
8555-284449-0004	since last thursday i kip kisizzle have been the lawful booleroo of the blue country but now that you are conquered by queen trot i suppose i am conquered too and you have no booleroo at all
8555-284449-0005	When he finished, she said cheerfully,
8555-284449-0006	"'Don't worry, Sizzledeer. It'll all come right pretty soon.'
8555-284449-0007	now then let's enter the city and enjoy the great feast that's being cooked i'm nearly starvin myself for this conquerin kingdoms is hard work
8555-284449-0008	then she gave rosalie back her magic ring thanking the kind witch for all she had done for them
8555-284449-0009	"'You are, mate,' replied the sailor."
8555-284449-0010	"'It will be such a satisfaction.'
8555-284449-0011	the guards had a terrible struggle with the goat which was loose in the room and still wanted to fight but finally they subdued the animal and then they took the boolaroo out of the frame he was tied in and brought both him and the goat before queen trot who awaited them in the throne room of the palace
8555-284449-0012	i'll gladly do that promised the new boolaroo and i'll feed the honourable goat all the shavings and leather and tin cans he can eat besides the grass
8555-284449-0013	"'Excuse me,' said Trot. "'I neglected to tell you that you're not the Boolaroo any more.'
8555-284449-0014	The former bularoo groaned.
8555-284449-0015	"'I'll not be wicked any more,' sighed the old Boolaroo. "'I'll reform.'
8555-284449-0016	"'As a private citizen, I shall be a model of deportment, because it would be dangerous to be otherwise.'
8555-284449-0017	when first they entered the throne room they tried to be as haughty and scornful as ever but the blues who were assembled there all laughed at them and jeered them for there was not a single person in all the blue country who loved the princesses the least little bit
8555-284449-0018	so gip gissel ordered the captain to take a file of soldiers and escort the raving beauties to their new home
8555-284449-0019	that evening trot gave a grand ball in the palace to which the most important of the pinkies and the blueskins were invited
8555-284449-0020	the combined bands of both the countries played the music and a fine supper was served
8555-292519-0000	brighter than early dawn's most brilliant dye are blown clear bands of color through the sky that swirl and sweep and meet to break and foam like rainbow veils upon a bubble's dome
8555-292519-0001	guided by you how we might stroll towards death our only music one another's breath through gardens intimate with hollyhocks where silent poppies burned between the rocks by pools where birches bend to confidants above green waters scummed with lily plants
8555-292519-0002	Venice
8555-292519-0003	in a sunset glowing of crimson and gold she lies the glory of the world a beached king's galley whose sails are furled who is hung with tapestries rich and old
8555-292519-0004	the pity that we must come and go
8555-292519-0005	while the old gold and the marble stays forever gleaming its soft strong blaze calm in the early evening glow
8555-292519-0006	the pleasant graveyard of my soul with sentimental cypress trees and flowers is filled that i may stroll in meditation at my ease
8555-292519-0007	it is my heart hung in the sky and no clouds ever float between the grave-flowers and my heart on high
8555-292519-0008	Over the track-lined city street the young men, the grinning men, pass.
8555-292519-0009	ho ye sails that seem to wander in dream filled meadows say is the shore where i stand the only field of struggle or are ye hit and battered out there by waves and wind-gusts as ye tack over a clashing sea of watery echoes
8555-292519-0010	old dances are simplified of their yearning bleached by time
8555-292519-0011	"'He had got into her courtyard.'
8555-292519-0012	Through the black night rain he sang to her window-bars.
8555-292519-0013	that was but rustling of dripping plants in the dark.
8555-292519-0014	"'She was alone that night.'
8555-292519-0015	He had broken into her courtyard.
908-157963-0000	to fade away like morning beauty from her mortal day down by the river of adonah her soft voice is heard and thus her gentle lamentation falls like morning dew
908-157963-0001	O life of this our spring!
908-157963-0002	Why fades the lotus of the water?
908-157963-0003	Why fade these children of the spring
908-157963-0004	thell is like a watery bow and like a parting cloud like a reflection in a glass like shadows in the water like dreams of infants like a smile upon an infant's face
908-157963-0005	Like the dove's voice, like transient day, like music in the air. Ah!
908-157963-0006	and gentle sleep the sleep of death, and gently hear the voice of him that walketh in the garden in the evening time.
908-157963-0007	The lily of the valley, breathing in the humble grass, answered the lovely maid, and said, I am a watery weed, and I am very small, and love to dwell in lowly vales. So weak, the gilded butterfly scarce perches on my head, yet I am visited from heaven, and he that smiles on all walks in the valley, and each morn over me spreads his hand, saying, Rejoice, thou humble grass!
908-157963-0008	thou gentle maid of silent valleys and of modest brooks for thou shall be clothed in light and fed with morning manna till summer's heat melts thee beside the fountains and the springs to flourish in eternal vales they why should thou complain
908-157963-0009	Why should the mistress of the vales of Har utter a sigh?
908-157963-0010	She ceased and smiled in tears, then sat down in her silver shrine.
908-157963-0011	which thou dost scatter on every little blade of grass that springs revives the milked cow and tames the fire-breathing steed
908-157963-0012	but thvel is like a faint cloud kindled at the rising sun i vanish from my pearly throne and who shall find my place
908-157963-0013	and why it scatters its bright beauty through the humid air.
908-157963-0014	Descend, O little cloud, and hover before the eyes of Thel.
908-157963-0015	o little cloud the virgin said i charge thee to tell me why thou complainest now when in one hour thou fade away then we shall seek thee but not find ah fell as like to thee
908-157963-0016	I pass away, yet I complain, and no one hears my voice.
908-157963-0017	The cloud then showed his golden head, and his bright form emerged.
908-157963-0018	And fearest thou because I vanish and am seen no more?
908-157963-0019	it is to tenfold life to love to peace and raptures holy unseen descending weigh my light wings upon balmy flowers and court the fair i'd do to take me to her shining tent the weeping virgin trembling kneels before the risen sun
908-157963-0020	till we arise linked in a golden band and never part but walk united bearing food to all our tender flowers
908-157963-0021	lives not alone nor of itself fear not and i will call the weak worm from its lowly bed and thou shalt hear its voice
908-157963-0022	Come forth, worm, and the silent valley To thy pensive queen.
908-157963-0023	the helpless worm arose and sat upon the lily's leaf and the bright cloud sailed on to find his partner in the vale
908-157963-0024	Image of weakness, art thou but a worm?
908-157963-0025	i see they lay helpless and naked weeping and none to answer none to cherish thee with mother's smiles
908-157963-0026	and says thou mother of my children i have loved thee and i have given thee a crown that none can take away
908-157963-0027	and lay me down in thy cold bed, and leave my shining lot.
908-157963-0028	or an eye of gifts and graces, showering fruits and coining gold.
908-157963-0029	Why a tongue impressed with honey from every wind?
908-157963-0030	Why an ear, a whirlpool, fierce to draw creations in?
908-31957-0000	All is said without a word.
908-31957-0001	i sit beneath thy looks as children do in the noon sun with souls that tremble through their happy eyelids from an unaverred yet prodigal inward joy
908-31957-0002	i did not wrong myself so but i placed a wrong on thee
908-31957-0003	When called before, I told how hastily I dropped my flowers, or break off from a game.
908-31957-0004	shall i never miss home-talk and blessing and the common kiss that comes to each in turn nor count it strange when i look up to drop on a new range of walls and floors another home than this
908-31957-0005	Alas! I have grieved, so I am hard to love.
908-31957-0006	Open thy heart wide, and fold within The wet wings of thy dove.
908-31957-0007	Could it mean, to last, a love set pendulous between sorrow and sorrow?
908-31957-0008	nay i rather thrilled distrusting every light that seemed to gild the onward path and feared to over lean a finger even
908-31957-0009	And though I have grown serene and strong since then, I think that God has willed a still renewable fear.
908-31957-0010	O love, O troth,
908-31957-0011	And love be false.
908-31957-0012	if he to keep one oath must lose one joy by his life's star foretold
908-31957-0013	slow to world greetings, quick with its, oh, list, when the angels speak.
908-31957-0014	a ring of amethyst i could not wear here plainer to my sight than that first kiss
908-31957-0015	that was the chrism of love which love's own crown with sanctifying sweetness did precede the third upon my lips was folded down in perfect purple state since when indeed i have been proud and said my love my own
908-31957-0016	Dearest, teach me so to pour out gratitude, as thou dost good.
908-31957-0017	Musselmans and gyors throw kerchiefs at a smile, and have no ruth for any weeping.
908-31957-0018	But thou art not such a lover, my beloved.
908-31957-0019	Thou canst wait, through sorrow and sickness, to bring souls to touch, and think it soon when others cry too late.
908-31957-0020	i thank all who have loved me in their hearts with thanks and love from mine
908-31957-0021	oh to shoot my soul's full meaning into future years that they should lend it utterance and salute love that endures from life that disappears
908-31957-0022	then i long tried by natural ills received the comfort fast while budding at thy sight my pilgrim's staff gave out green leaves with morning dews imperled
908-31957-0023	i love thee freely as men strive for right i love thee purely as they turn from praise
908-31957-0024	I love thee with the passion put to use, and my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
908-31957-0025	i love thee with a love i seemed to lose with my lost saints i love thee with the breath smiles tears of all my life and if god choose i shall but love thee better after death
