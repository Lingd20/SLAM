POD1000000004_S0000000	hey friends i do not know about you but when i was a kid i knew absolutely nothing about money well there is a new show from marketplace and brains on that will help address just that
POD1000000004_S0000001	10 bazillion is a new podcast for kids and their families it is all about money how it works how we use it where it comes from and how we could all get a little bit smarter about it but in a fun way
POD1000000004_S0000002	10 bazillion helping dollars make more sense this podcast is presented in partnership with greenlight the debit card for kids listen and subscribe wherever you get your podcasts
POD1000000004_S0000003	leila green is a trauma surgeon in houston
POD1000000004_S0000004	i meet people on the worst day of their life usually
POD1000000004_S0000005	well then i guess i should be glad we did not meet in real life before leela could become doctor green she had to do a whole lot of training
POD1000000004_S0000006	and you know what is really hard to do when you are working a bonkers number of hours eat properly
POD1000000004_S0000007	i was in general surgery residency at the time and kind of tired of eating like hospital food or fast food and things
POD1000000004_S0000008	and that is when she heard about this service a meal kit delivery that would send her all the ingredients she would need to make 3 full meals plus instructions on how to make them no more time consuming trips to the grocery store and no more desperation big macs
POD1000000004_S0000009	so i said well i will try it i got a free box and so i said ok i can do this and i lived by myself so i thought it would just be something fun to do
POD1000000004_S0000010	what green is conveniently leaving out of her story is her level of cooking experience pre meal kit
POD1000000004_S0000011	i can heat things up
POD1000000004_S0000013	what
POD1000000004_S0000014	i had to buy so many different things once these boxes started coming you need all these equipment and things that i did not have i had to buy zesters
POD1000000004_S0000015	and like i did not have a garlic press what is this okay but i you know i am a surgeon so i have to have all the right instruments what do you
POD1000000004_S0000017	you know to put this stuff together
POD1000000004_S0000018	getting a meal kit every week did force green to upgrade her kitchen utensil game but more importantly it gave her back time something that as a trauma surgeon she does not take for granted
POD1000000004_S0000019	plus the meal kits help green hone her cooking skills forget just pressing cook on the microwave green is now a master in the fine art of mise en place
POD1000000004_S0000020	you know you have to learn how to like chop everything up and set it aside and
POD1000000004_S0000021	right
POD1000000004_S0000022	you know you really do have to feel like you are cooking things because you really do have to put everything together
POD1000000004_S0000023	right now i would think if you were a surgeon your knife skills would not be too bad
POD1000000004_S0000024	0 no i mean i can cut people and carrots okay i could you know
POD1000000004_S0000025	in the year that green subscribed to that meal kit delivery service she made seared steak and pizza from scratch and a whole host of other things she would never normally prepare for herself and she documented her cooking journey on instagram
POD1000000004_S0000026	but eventually green finished her training and got back to a more regular schedule which allowed for grocery shopping and meal prep so she canceled her subscription
POD1000000004_S0000027	which was bad news for the meal kit service she was using blue apron you may be familiar with the company from such podcasts as all of them

POD1000000004_S0000041	when blue apron began in 2012 it was supposed to revolutionize how americans ate it was going to gently pull us away from our takeout and our tv dinners and nudge us back into the kitchen and for a while it worked until it did not
POD1000000004_S0000042	and americans return to the warm embrace of their boxed mac and cheese and takeout pad thai obviously a home cooking revolution did not materialize
POD1000000004_S0000043	or did it the novel coronavirus has forced many of us to become intimately acquainted with our casserole dishes and our garlic presses and our dutch ovens
POD1000000004_S0000044	we made banana bread by the pallet and sourdough starter by the ton we learned how to sear steaks and spatchcock chickens and all manner of gruesome carnivorous techniques in short boy did we ever cook
POD1000000004_S0000045	all this cooking at home created a make or break moment for blue apron but it was not supposed to be like that just a few years ago the company was valued at $20 now it was barely hanging on by its fingernails
POD1000000004_S0000046	it is only lifeline a global health crisis that required so many of us to shelter in place for months and avoid trips to the grocery store
POD1000000004_S0000047	i am lauren oberyn from american public media welcome to the new season of spectacular failures the show that always flambes the hell out of failure
POD1000000004_S0000049	legend has it that the idea for blue apron began with an argentinian steak there were these 2 guys matt salzberg and elia pappas and they were clever tech entrepreneur types
POD1000000004_S0000050	full of ideas salzberg had an mba from harvard and cut his teeth in a big new york venture capital firm pappas was a go getter software engineer they met at a network y happy hour and decided to go into business together
POD1000000004_S0000051	but what kind of business
POD1000000004_S0000052	their original idea is not meal kits it is more of a research crowdfunding idea called petri dish
POD1000000004_S0000053	that is alex conrad he is a senior editor at forbes he wrote about the founders in 2015 petri dish was not the pair is only startup idea
POD1000000004_S0000054	i think another one we highlighted in our article was warby parker for strollers
POD1000000004_S0000055	do not even understand
POD1000000004_S0000057	a high end but also affordable stroller experience yeah
POD1000000004_S0000058	so those 2 startup ideas a kickstarter for science experiments and a warby parker for strollers were non starters for the pair but then over grilled meat it hit them
POD1000000004_S0000059	salzburg and pappas are doing dinner and they are struggling to make argentinian steaks on a borrowed grill
POD1000000004_S0000060	and they are like would not it be great if there is a service basically for amateurs like us
POD1000000004_S0000061	in fact there was but it was in sweden in 2007 a woman named kiki tander created a company called .
POD1000000004_S0000062	middagsfrid that translates into dinner piece in english
POD1000000004_S0000063	let me see if i can pronounce this right midas kreet
POD1000000004_S0000064	that is pretty good
POD1000000004_S0000065	t and r wanted to solve the vexing nightly problem that families around the world face what are we having for dinner because the answer can not always be ice cream
POD1000000004_S0000066	people started talking about hell hour you know like the hour between 5 and 6 when you have to run to the grocery store and fight with your spouse about who is cooking tonight what are we having
POD1000000004_S0000067	that right there is the spirit of entrepreneurship
POD1000000004_S0000068	i think the question is then is this a legitimately huge problem and is this a problem that a lot of people have as well
POD1000000004_S0000069	for salzburg and pappas the answer to both of those questions was an enthusiastic yes now at this point it was 2012 and t anders company had been around for 5 years and was growing steadily
POD1000000004_S0000070	it had a few competitors in europe but in the us nothing of the sort existed which was great for salzburg and pappas
POD1000000004_S0000071	and so they think hey we can start our own meal kit company for the u s market called part and parsley
POD1000000004_S0000072	to be clear that is a terrible name and very quickly they changed it to blue apron named for what french apprentice chefs wear in the kitchen
POD1000000004_S0000073	at almost the exact same time a harvard classmate of salzburg is began a rival meal kit company called plated but salzburg and pappas were not worried because they had brought on a ringer
POD1000000004_S0000074	matt wadiak a chef with a degree from the prestigious culinary institute of america and wadiak was the guy that was going to make their business stand apart from its rivals
POD1000000004_S0000075	wadiak would basically go and source the ingredients farmers would say okay we would love to lock in these large extra orders
POD1000000004_S0000076	at a scale that is very attractive to us you know many 1000s of ingredients i think you know when he was in his food world that was a differentiator and great for blue apron
POD1000000004_S0000077	not only did wadiak design the menus and source the products but he also served as the social media face of the company he was blue apron is culinary secret weapon and did a series of early youtube videos showcasing his know how
POD1000000004_S0000078	here he is trying to convince us that artichokes are not vile
POD1000000004_S0000079	everybody likes artichokes but they are crazy what do you do with them they are tough they are spiny they are all over the place they are kind of confusing a lot of times people just do not cook them because they do not understand how to cook them
POD1000000004_S0000081	he cuts into some truly revolting artichokes and proceeds to make my worst dining nightmare
POD1000000004_S0000082	and get in there with a spoon and scoop out that really hairy choky interior and the reason why they call it the choke is because if you eat this you are going to choke it is full of little fibers and it is like a fish bone
POD1000000004_S0000083	in the early days all the founders had to hustle like this before they had staff it was salzburg pappas and wadiak packing up boxes in a small kitchen in long island city new york
POD1000000004_S0000084	then seemingly out of nowhere the company landed some sweet venture capital to the tune of $30 things were looking good for the startup
POD1000000004_S0000085	within the 1st few years the business took off in 2014 blue apron was shipping 60 meals a month by 2016 it was 80 meals and a $10 in revenue
POD1000000004_S0000086	within just 5 years of its founding the company employed 4500 people and was valued at nearly $20 blue apron looked like it was on the express train to successville
POD1000000004_S0000087	blue apron seemed to be sort of the buzziest the biggest market share the leader in this emerging category
POD1000000004_S0000088	which included hellofresh sunbasket and about a 10 companies with the word chef in the name
POD1000000004_S0000089	then i actually tried the products and it seemed at least to me personally just as someone testing the products that blue apron overall kind of had the experience that resonated the most with me and i thought might resonate the most with americans
POD1000000004_S0000090	now the thing about americans is
POD1000000004_S0000091	we love products that claim to make our lives easier more convenient less of a hassle and that is exactly what blue apron was doing it was saying hey working mom we know you have a lot on your plate lol
POD1000000004_S0000092	we want to help you cook nutritious and delicious meals for your family without the hassle of going to the grocery store or reading a cookbook
POD1000000004_S0000093	but it was also saying hey millennial we know you are a work hard play hard eat sloppy takeout at 9 p m kind of person but we also know that you would love to cook if only it was not such a time consuming pain in the ass
POD1000000004_S0000094	so we are going to make it super convenient for you
POD1000000004_S0000096	this american obsession with convenience around food and in particular the magical home cooked meal minus the effort goes back to at least the late 19th century says culinary historian laura shapiro
POD1000000004_S0000097	that was when a particular brand of utopian fiction began to emerge
POD1000000004_S0000098	the plot was sort of the same somebody is taking a walk they get bonked on the head when they wake up it is 500 years in the future and they are surrounded by all these strange looking creatures and it is a whole different world
POD1000000004_S0000099	and somebody takes them to dinner they take them home to dinner and it is a miracle dinner
POD1000000004_S0000100	the food just appeared with the press of a button or the wave of an arm and it was scrumptious and filling and most importantly back then digestible
POD1000000004_S0000101	miracle food it was utopian food and that has been a dream i think that has attached itself to the american dinner table for decades and decades
POD1000000004_S0000102	not long after the emergence of this utopian fiction dining actually did start to look like a miracle you could buy vegetables in a can and chicken in a can and later full meals like spaghetti and meatballs in a can
POD1000000004_S0000103	then in the 1950s came the frozen turkey dinner just whack it in the oven and presto a rubbery simulacrum of the real thing but it was quick and cleanup was a breeze
POD1000000004_S0000104	mother murphy lucky me my wife uses swanson tv turkey dinners and make your husband lucky too get swanson tv turkey dinners swanson tv fried chicken dinners
POD1000000004_S0000105	swanson tv beef dinners from your grocer is big freezer
POD1000000004_S0000106	when frozen fish 6 hit the scene around the same time ooh buddy it was utopian fiction come to life
POD1000000004_S0000107	master chad morley ate missus paul is fish sticks with his fingers
POD1000000004_S0000108	now i am 32 and i use a fork sometimes
POD1000000004_S0000109	missus paul is fish sticks you never stop loving them
POD1000000004_S0000110	it was an immediate success these you know deep fried frozen fish sticks that tasted not at all of fish which meant that people adored them
POD1000000004_S0000111	obviously fish sticks took off and the industry used that as an excuse to stickify everything chicken eggplant lima beans whatever you could deep fry and freeze the packaged food industry tried it
POD1000000004_S0000112	the post war years also brought an explosion of fast food and takeout meals and now in the 21st century we can order just about any food we want from some vegan drumsticks to a prefix haute cuisine meal just by pressing an app
POD1000000004_S0000113	all of these iterations of the miracle dinner it is like they aim at 3 longings that women have always had when they think about making dinner they want it to be effortless
POD1000000004_S0000114	they want it to be delicious and they want it to have the moral value of home cooking
POD1000000004_S0000115	the home cooking aspect of this is perhaps the most resonant
POD1000000004_S0000116	the thing that home cooking delivers that none of these other things do is that it satisfies i think what we all feel as the moral imperative to cook
POD1000000004_S0000117	there is something that just does not click in when the thing comes in from outside
POD1000000004_S0000118	and this is a great thing for a company like blue apron because
POD1000000004_S0000119	blue apron inches a little closer to that it gets you that much closer to feeling as though you have cooked this
POD1000000004_S0000120	notice shapiro said feeling as though you cooked something because for her what blue apron is doing despite all of its fresh ingredients and chef inspired recipes is helping you assemble
POD1000000004_S0000121	they kind of fool you into thinking you are cooking whereas real cooking hands on cooking knowledgeable cooking has to do with cooking day after day
POD1000000004_S0000122	does not mean you are making fabulous elaborate meals day after day even if it is the simplest possible thing that is cooking
POD1000000004_S0000123	sure getting a dime bag of za atar a thimble full of pepitas and a literal tablespoon of sesame oil in your meal kit does have a somewhat infantilizing effect
POD1000000004_S0000124	but in blue apron is early years plenty of people were happy to have everything portioned out for them but convincing potential customers that they wanted and needed a service like that that cost the company some big cash
POD1000000004_S0000125	in the form of free meals tons of specials and endless advertising anyone who listened to podcasts in 2015 through 2018 is bound to have heard at least one disinterested podcast host give a lackluster blue apron ad read
POD1000000004_S0000127	in biz speak all of this is known as the cac or customer acquisition cost
POD1000000004_S0000128	what it is supposed to be is the total amount of money that the company spent
POD1000000004_S0000129	on marketing to acquire customers divided by the number of customers that they actually acquired
POD1000000004_S0000130	that is dan mccarthy he is a marketing professor at emory university is business school and he is studied blue apron for years mccarthy says that in the early days blue apron was spending about $60 $70 per customer
POD1000000004_S0000131	but then as people came and went blue apron had to spend more and more money to get new customers on board the customer acquisition cost just kept creeping up and up and up until it nearly doubled
POD1000000004_S0000132	and you can imagine if you are spending 120 just to bring somebody in when you talk about the amount of profit that you need after that to break even on that customer that is a tougher proposition
POD1000000004_S0000133	the more money blue apron spent the harder it was to recoup the investment which brings us to the 2nd problem preventing customers from bolting once the company has spent all that money to bring them in
POD1000000004_S0000134	how many customers stick around is measured by a really important metric called churn rate the churn rate tells you the rate at which customers come into and spin out of the business
POD1000000004_S0000135	if you are spending a lot of cash to land new customers and they do not stick around long enough to make any money off of them you have high customer acquisition costs and a high churn rate
POD1000000004_S0000136	that is where blue apron found itself and even the most basic cooking dodo could tell you that is a gourmet recipe for losing a lot of money
POD1000000004_S0000137	our pal doctor green used blue apron for about a year which is way longer than most of its customers stuck around
POD1000000004_S0000138	yes about half the people were churning out in a month by 6 months about 70% of their customers were churning out they just were not able to keep those customers for as long as they should
POD1000000004_S0000139	despite blue apron is early success and growth one nut the company has never been able to crack is how to stop that outflow how do you get people to subscribe and stay subscribed at least long enough to make a profit off of them it is a puzzle
POD1000000004_S0000140	but despite its high churn rate blue apron was still the market leader it had gotten a slight jumpstart on rival hellofresh and was starting to look real sexy to big investors
POD1000000004_S0000141	they were the £800 gorillas and even though the space itself was not that that large at the time it was still something like $50 and growing really quickly
POD1000000004_S0000142	on its face business seemed booming but the whole meal kit market was on the cusp of a shakeup
POD1000000004_S0000143	in 2017 grocery chains albertsons and kroger each picked off competing meal kit companies then another blue apron rival chef would abruptly shut down and laid off all its employees only to be bought a week later
POD1000000004_S0000144	and so blue apron was at a crossroad says alex conrad
POD1000000004_S0000145	for startups the most common exits are you know you fail you go public or you get bought those are really the only traditional outcomes and so for the companies that did not want to fail they were going to have to go public someday or sell
POD1000000004_S0000146	like that is just the reality
POD1000000004_S0000147	so blue apron had 3 choices pack it in sell or go public we are going to take a quick break when we come back join me in my outdated condo kitchen as i whip up some delicious blue apron meals
POD1000000004_S0000148	and we explain how the really terrible coronavirus was also a little bit good for blue apron plus we gaze into our meal kit crystal ball to see what the future might hold spoiler the future is delicious

POD1000000004_S0000166	no story about blue apron could be called complete without sampling the product so i ordered up a box and paid for it mind you
POD1000000004_S0000167	okay so i just got my blue apron box at my doorstep and when i picked it up i could not believe how heavy it was
POD1000000004_S0000168	when the box arrived it felt like christmas except better because the food was not mediocre and arranged in a shrink wrapped basket
POD1000000004_S0000169	so let us crack into this box
POD1000000004_S0000170	inside there were 2 bunches of kale some loose onions and about a 10 tiny baggies of knickknacks including 2 tablespoons of creme fraiche a quarter of a cup of panko breadcrumbs and one teaspoon of something called furikake
POD1000000004_S0000171	which according to the blue apron recipe was supposed to quote lend even more savory flavor to my dish yum
POD1000000004_S0000173	there is the tiniest the tiniest tiniest portion of brown rice i mean this must be maybe half a cup in a bag maybe 3 times the size
POD1000000004_S0000174	i decided that it would be sad to cook these dishes by myself so i invited my girlfriend over to experience the magic of blue apron with me
POD1000000004_S0000175	you have a choice between meals tonight
POD1000000004_S0000176	i am so ready mostly because i am so hungry
POD1000000004_S0000177	0 well we had the choice of 3 dishes but one of them had cilantro sauce so no thank you another was like a spicy indian situation and i was feeling kind of basic so i chose the pesto and kale pasta with goat cheese
POD1000000004_S0000178	it says this quick cooking pasta gets a 12 punch of irresistible flavor from a dollop of creamy goat cheese for delicious tang and our herbaceous basil pesto stirred into the warm pasta and garlicky kale just before serving
POD1000000004_S0000179	by the way that was ron is idea
POD1000000004_S0000180	herbaceous
POD1000000004_S0000181	a touch of crushed red pepper
POD1000000004_S0000182	technically we picked the easiest dish so what things were going well until i dropped a garlic clove down the insincorator
POD1000000004_S0000183	0 hannah no get your hand out of the garbage disposal
POD1000000004_S0000184	after that near catastrophe we boiled the fresh cavatelli sauteed the kale with garlic and red pepper flakes added the pesto and the dollop of goat cheese and voila
POD1000000004_S0000185	can i get you a bowl of pasta
POD1000000004_S0000186	well yes
POD1000000004_S0000187	you could
POD1000000004_S0000188	and i am here to report we made a damn fine meal the kale was tender crisp and very well seasoned the cavatelli was perfectly al dente well done hannah and the cheese added some good saltiness
POD1000000004_S0000189	i would say we are perfectly satisfied diners but wait there is more
POD1000000004_S0000190	cleanup is practically nothing because everything came out of a packet so really we are only left with
POD1000000004_S0000191	actually that is really nice
POD1000000004_S0000192	a couple of dishes
POD1000000004_S0000193	i do not want to underestimate that i think that is really nice
POD1000000004_S0000194	but not everyone who is used blue apron has appreciated that the company has gotten flack for its abundant packaging though much of it is now recyclable and customers have complained that the recipes were too complicated
POD1000000004_S0000195	i made 4 blue apron meals for the story and for a middling cook with a reasonable amount of cookware i thought the dishes were pretty simple to assemble also pretty tasty
POD1000000004_S0000196	i would make every single one of those dishes again but i do the shopping myself which i guess sort of defeats the purpose
POD1000000004_S0000197	when i opened my 1st blue apron box it was a novelty a cornucopia on cardboard but then i forgot to cancel my subscription and i got a 2nd box by accident
POD1000000004_S0000198	that one was not as exciting by then i understood the gimmick and the excitement of discovery kind of fizzled in this way i am not too different from a lot of people who try blue apron says professor dan mccarthy
POD1000000004_S0000199	discovery does not tend to last that long there is a bunch of people they look at blue apron as this you know it is like i want kind of this surprise and delight every month
POD1000000004_S0000200	and the problem is they may want that initially but after you have been surprised and delighted a few times you say you know i am pretty good i do not need any more of this surprise and delight
POD1000000004_S0000201	but blue apron execs were like yeah you do you need it and you want it and they believed in their product is ability not just to continually delight but to actually provide a valuable service to people
POD1000000004_S0000202	and all that meant that in 2017 the company had to work out its options pack it in sell or go public
POD1000000004_S0000203	and the higher ups decided on going public
POD1000000004_S0000204	now before offering up public stock in the company for the 1st time blue apron wanted to show strong customer growth so they started to amp up spending to bring in new users
POD1000000004_S0000205	remember cac the customer acquisition cost in the year before the ipo blue apron increased its market in cash by almost 200%
POD1000000004_S0000206	but none of this marketing resulted in a huge new customer haul and that says forbes alex conrad made investors a little less in love with the company
POD1000000004_S0000207	it was hard to make a really attractive you know future facing story for like how blue apron really becomes that huge
POD1000000004_S0000208	blue apron is books were not the only thing that made investors turn up their noses around the ipo a couple weeks before the blue apron team was set to ring the bell for new york stock exchange amazon made a little announcement
POD1000000004_S0000209	it was buying whole foods in a $1370 deal for blue apron it was like getting upstaged at your own wedding by an impossibly rich and infinitely more beautiful guest of a guest
POD1000000004_S0000210	when amazon is acquisition of whole foods was announced that was just devastating even just psychologically it felt like you know here come the giants
POD1000000004_S0000211	and if amazon can sell things to you online really well and whole foods has pretty good ingredients what is blue apron really selling here
POD1000000004_S0000212	and then of course amazon trademarked its own meal kit offering
POD1000000004_S0000213	everyone was very concerned that basically this was going to be the next you know i will not call blue apron an ant you know but i would say everyone agree amazon is way bigger right
POD1000000004_S0000215	they were just going to bowl their way right in and stamp this industry out and so that was a big lurking concern
POD1000000004_S0000216	blue apron is ipo in the summer of 2017 raised $30 about a 3rd of what the company anticipated stock went for about $10 a share rather than the expected $15 to $17
POD1000000004_S0000217	it was a turbulent ipo to say the least
POD1000000004_S0000218	still blue apron co founder and ceo matt salzberg seemed pretty upbeat about the whole situation on cnbc
POD1000000004_S0000219	i am honestly not here to really talk about the pricing of blue apron stock that is really up to the investors to decide you know blue apron is here because we are excited about the big opportunity that we are going after
POD1000000004_S0000220	we are tackling a huge market and we are focused on the long term quite frankly and the stock price today whether it is up down left or right is really just the beginning of this new chapter in our company is life that we are really excited about
POD1000000004_S0000222	one thing salzburg mentioned in that clip was how his company was tackling a huge market now if you are defining the market as all the people who eat food in america then yeah that is a huge market
POD1000000004_S0000223	but according to the good folks at market research company packaged facts that market has a ceiling and not like a cathedral ceiling
POD1000000004_S0000224	initially the market was definitely expanding exponentially and i think that is where a lot of the interest initially came from if you are seeing these companies that are having 100% growth that is really significant
POD1000000004_S0000225	that is kara rash she is a food and beverage analyst with packaged facts
POD1000000004_S0000226	one of the whole things that i think went wrong with the industry is people thought there was a very big addressable market for meal kits but as it turns out there really is not
POD1000000004_S0000227	it is hard to gauge but rash estimates that only about one of the us population uses home delivery meal kits and she says the market kind of peaked 2 or 3 years ago
POD1000000004_S0000228	since blue apron started more than 150 meal kit services have come on the scene but only about 15 to 20 are national operations with hellofresh now the clear market leader
POD1000000004_S0000229	remember when we said amazon trademarked its meal kit back in 2017 rash says the company never did much with it and that is a pretty good indicator that meal kit delivery is not a growing global concern
POD1000000004_S0000230	i think that amazon saw that much of the market for meal kits had already been addressed by the competitors that were already there so they did not try really to break into that because they did not see much potential for growth anymore
POD1000000004_S0000231	it seems like amazon was right to hold off in 2017 blue apron hemorrhaged 250000 customers and its stock price had tanked to just $2.99 a share by the end of the year
POD1000000004_S0000232	and there were more problems within a month of the ipo co founder matt wadiak stepped down as coo matt salzberg then the ceo resigned his post shortly thereafter
POD1000000004_S0000233	blue apron is expensive brand spanking new fulfillment center in new jersey had a bunch of tech bugs that needed to be worked out and workers from its california operation filed a class action lawsuit over alleged missing wages
POD1000000004_S0000234	things were looking pretty grim for the once hyped company
POD1000000004_S0000235	welcome to trading nation i am eric chummey let us take a look at one of last year is high profile ipos that is getting absolutely smoked we are talking of course about blue apron the stock sinking as much as 4% on friday
POD1000000004_S0000236	by the end of 2018 blue apron stock dipped below a dollar a share and the slide did not seem to be letting up
POD1000000004_S0000237	the following summer the company tried a move meant to keep it from being booted from the stock exchange it is called a reverse stock spot
POD1000000004_S0000238	and basically it means that the company bundled its shares so you get a fewer total number of shares but each share is worth more like trading in 4 quarters for a dollar
POD1000000004_S0000239	the move raised the company is stock price but customers still were not flocking to blue apron is boxes now at this point i would have thrown in the towel but not ceo linda finley kozlowski
POD1000000004_S0000240	the company would not make kozlowski available for a chat but here she is last year on cnbc is squawk on the street talking about how jazzed she is about blue apron is prospects
POD1000000004_S0000241	and our recipes our ingredients our culinary authority our brand recognition is by far still number one so we feel confident that when we are talking to investors they appreciate and understand that there is something here it is really just about getting execution right and making sure that we are actually
POD1000000004_S0000242	cool cool cool but also blue apron was thinking about getting down with some strategic alternatives says marketwatch is tanya garcia
POD1000000004_S0000243	strategic alternatives which means a lot and nothing at the same time right
POD1000000004_S0000244	it is like saying i am totally happy being single but i would be into dating if the right person came along
POD1000000004_S0000245	it is kind of like one of those things that companies will say when they are just like well we would be open to you know getting bought or a partnership if you are interested you know kind of a thing
POD1000000004_S0000246	in early 2020 blue apron put the word out that it was interested in possibly getting scooped up maybe by a big grocery chain or someone else with deep pockets who wanted to own a meal kit delivery business
POD1000000004_S0000247	at the same time garcia says the company acted like it was in turnaround mode it decided to streamline operations including shutting down its fulfillment center in texas
POD1000000004_S0000248	it also did away with trying to shovel everyone who had ever eaten food into the top of its customer funnel
POD1000000004_S0000249	they have decided to focus on what they call their core customers and these are people who are not going to do like a lot of people and use a coupon and you know get blue apron for a month and then cancel their subscription
POD1000000004_S0000250	so at the same time blue apron was looking to sell it was also doubling down on its mission these were last gasp efforts it wanted to save itself
POD1000000004_S0000251	and then came the most unlikely lifeline anyone could think of a global pandemic a highly contagious virus that require those of us without essential jobs to practically never leave our houses
POD1000000004_S0000252	online grocery delivery shot through the roof and suddenly everyone remembered about this company they heard about on a podcast ad 3 years ago
POD1000000004_S0000253	the pandemic has been actually a bit of a good thing for them because it has raised demand
POD1000000004_S0000254	blue apron sees a lot of potential in what the company is offering especially given that more americans seem to be interested in cooking at home thanks corona
POD1000000004_S0000255	if you are blue apron then you are probably thinking you know well if we do a good job some of this will stick
POD1000000004_S0000256	in the 1st quarter of 2020 when coronavirus brought america to a standstill blue apron customer orders were up a bit though they did not spike like the markets hoped the company still lost $20 but that was a little better than the previous quarter
POD1000000004_S0000257	on its 1st quarter earnings call of 2020 the company is ceo and cfo shook their pom poms like they were on an episode of cheer but like the version that features slightly wooden corporate executives
POD1000000004_S0000258	so you know i think the combination of those things you know puts us in a good position going forward and you know we can not specifically guide to what is going to happen in the 2nd half of the year because of all the uncertainties
POD1000000004_S0000259	we do believe that there will continue to be some positive effects as we move out of q 2
POD1000000004_S0000260	the pandemic seems like it is given blue apron a decent little boost in the 2nd quarter the company brought in 20000 more subscribers but that is still way below where they were in 2019
POD1000000004_S0000261	it is anyone is guess whether blue apron specifically and meal kit delivery more generally are here to stay the business kiki tiander founded in sweden 13 years ago is still delivering weekly meal fixings to busy swedes
POD1000000004_S0000262	and despite its own turbulence market leader hellofresh is still cranking out boxes and there is no shortage of small meal kit companies looking to fill paleo or vegan or regional cuisine niches
POD1000000004_S0000263	no one knows what the true impact of a global pandemic will be on how we eat and where and when not yet anyway grocery delivery seems like it is here to stay
POD1000000004_S0000264	maybe high end restaurant takeout will also stick around in some form it is hard to tell whether all those people who took up home cooking out of necessity will continue to bake crusty sourdough and whip up elaborate curries when we can all safely frequent our favorite local spots
POD1000000004_S0000265	blue apron is banking on a sea change in how americans eat the company that was shopping for a buyer just a month before the pandemic hit is now trying to turn a cataclysmic global event into a business saving opportunity

POD1000000010_S0000002	and it changed the whole focus of her life
POD1000000010_S0000003	there are only 2 kinds of people in the world good people and good people in pain
POD1000000010_S0000004	her name is scarlett lewis and before we met her corey i have to confess that i was not necessarily all that impressed with kindness as an idea i mean .
POD1000000010_S0000005	you are a kindness skeptic
POD1000000010_S0000006	well i do not want to say skeptic but just let us say that kindness is like a slogan that is on a pillow that i would never have on my couch
POD1000000010_S0000007	but that really really changed for me when we traveled to rural connecticut to spend some time with scarlett
POD1000000010_S0000009	i have lived on this farm for 20 years before the 2 boys and it is really my dream place
POD1000000010_S0000010	scarlett named this place wild rose farm there are a few chickens clucking in a wire coop behind a muddy pasture where there is also a horse
POD1000000010_S0000011	this is one of the oldest barns in fairfield county
POD1000000010_S0000012	really
POD1000000010_S0000013	yeah the house is 1740 so older than the united states of america
POD1000000010_S0000014	we get there in time to watch her feed the animals including her constant companions 3 dogs remington rocky and olive
POD1000000010_S0000015	and he is hungry too
POD1000000010_S0000016	i think he thought that the mic was a dog watch out
POD1000000010_S0000017	so scarlett leads us inside the house and i remember we took our jackets off in the mudroom and hanging there was a 1st grader is black and blue ski jacket
POD1000000010_S0000018	and scarlett stopped and she pulled out a pair of these funny looking teeth out of the pocket joke teeth
POD1000000010_S0000019	i always say that he wore these little teeth because he was such a goofball to school every day
POD1000000010_S0000020	little silver teeth
POD1000000010_S0000021	yeah
POD1000000010_S0000022	aw
POD1000000010_S0000023	scarlett is son jesse had these teeth in this coat at sandy hook elementary school the day he died
POD1000000010_S0000024	my name is scarlett lewis and i am the founder of the jesse lewis choose love movement
POD1000000010_S0000025	and i founded this organization following the murder of my 6 year old son alongside 19 of his classmates and 6 educators in one of the worst mass murders in u s history
POD1000000010_S0000026	here in sandy hook connecticut in 2012 scarlett lived through every parent is nightmare
POD1000000010_S0000027	and following that i realized that there is not a they out there
POD1000000010_S0000028	and by they she means someone else who is going to come into our schools and our homes and help kids replace their anger and violence with warmth and compassion
POD1000000010_S0000029	right then we come into the sunny kitchen which is painted turquoise and bright yellow
POD1000000010_S0000030	every surface is covered with paintings scarlett is done and photos of jesse and his brother jt
POD1000000010_S0000031	and one of the cabinets has chalkboard paint on it and on it is a message from jesse
POD1000000010_S0000032	we hardly ever use this is spray painted chalkboard
POD1000000010_S0000033	scarlett did not notice this message until she returned to the house several days after the shooting to find clothes for jesse to wear in his casket
POD1000000010_S0000034	she walked in and froze
POD1000000010_S0000035	i saw that nurturing healing love and i could not believe it
POD1000000010_S0000036	nurturing healing love you can see those 3 words they are spelled phonetically in a 6 year old is jagged scrawl
POD1000000010_S0000037	i thought i would never be able to come back here i do not know why i am crying because usually i do not sorry
POD1000000010_S0000038	i am usually really good at keeping it together just give me a moment
POD1000000010_S0000040	scarlett says she has no idea how or where her little boy came up with those 3 words
POD1000000010_S0000041	but the moment she saw them she realized
POD1000000010_S0000042	this is my life now i knew i would be spending the rest of my life spreading this message
POD1000000010_S0000043	and by the way 6 years later you can tell what a moment it was because it is all i talk about it is all i do
POD1000000010_S0000044	it is the focus of my life every waking moment every breath every word that comes out of my mouth is about nurturing healing love really
POD1000000010_S0000046	you are listening to npr is life kit for parenting with sesame workshop

POD1000000010_S0000059	so corey yes kindness is important but i guess i always assumed that my kids would learn it naturally through osmosis
POD1000000010_S0000060	just if you love them they will become kind
POD1000000010_S0000061	well you know what anya you are not alone in that assumption
POD1000000010_S0000062	we often just expect people to be kind without talking about it
POD1000000010_S0000063	we think 0 you are a good kid you are going to be kind
POD1000000010_S0000064	that is jennifer kotler she is one of our expert guides today through what turns out to be a pretty complicated subject
POD1000000010_S0000065	kindness has been a part of sesame street from the beginning so it is not a new concept but
POD1000000010_S0000066	but she says the folks at sesame and lots of child development experts are starting to notice things warnings
POD1000000010_S0000067	not only in the headlines but in research
POD1000000010_S0000068	and that brings us to our 1st takeaway that parents and teachers are sending kids really mixed messages about kindness
POD1000000010_S0000069	exhibit a is this study jen points to out of harvard a few years back
POD1000000010_S0000070	middle school children for example thought that their parents valued academic success over kindness
POD1000000010_S0000071	in fact about 80% of children believed their parents were more concerned about good grades and their kids careers than whether they were caring towards others
POD1000000010_S0000072	80% and the parents on the other hand they got surveyed too
POD1000000010_S0000073	and they did not realize this they were totally wrong about the message that they thought their kids were getting
POD1000000010_S0000074	yeah and this kind of like self delusion this is just one of many reasons scarlett worries that this culture is creating huge problems
POD1000000010_S0000075	now at epidemic levels
POD1000000010_S0000076	and i am not talking about just school violence and bullying and loneliness but also substance abuse and mental illness
POD1000000010_S0000077	and of course her life is a really stark reminder corey of just how high the stakes can be when we talk about things like mental health and kids who are troubled
POD1000000010_S0000078	sometimes it is frustrating for me because we act like we do not know what to do
POD1000000010_S0000079	and we do know what to do
POD1000000010_S0000080	after she read that message from jesse scarlett lewis reached out to a team of researchers and educators and she created a plan to essentially teach children kindness step by step value by value
POD1000000010_S0000081	yeah the jesse lewis choose love enrichment program they estimate it is now reached over a 10 students
POD1000000010_S0000082	in fact in the past decade or so schools all over the country have woken up to the idea that they have a responsibility to teach kids how to treat each other
POD1000000010_S0000083	yeah and not just to prevent the next tragedy but also because research tells us that these non academic skills often called social and emotional skills
POD1000000010_S0000084	they make up about half of the equation that determines whether kids are going to be successful in their lives
POD1000000010_S0000085	so let us follow scarlett is lead and sesame street is and talk about how the science of kindness can translate into action
POD1000000010_S0000087	takeaway number 2
POD1000000010_S0000088	kids are born to be kind
POD1000000010_S0000089	but also unkind
POD1000000010_S0000090	here is what we mean
POD1000000010_S0000091	so on the one hand people have neurons in our brains called mirror neurons and they respond in the same way when we experience pain like we are pricked by a needle as we do when we watch someone else experience pain
POD1000000010_S0000092	it is a mirror
POD1000000010_S0000093	it lights up the same receptors in our brain as physical pain
POD1000000010_S0000094	soon after birth children for example will be more likely to cry as a result of hearing another child cry than they are in response to any other sort of noise
POD1000000010_S0000095	thomas lacona says we see signs of what is called empathic distress even in tiny babies
POD1000000010_S0000096	he is a psychologist who wrote the book on how to raise kind kids literally
POD1000000010_S0000097	that is what it is called he is also been a family counselor has 2 kids and 15 grandkids
POD1000000010_S0000098	and tom told us that baby is moral sense seems to go even deeper
POD1000000010_S0000099	studies going back to the late 1990s have found infants as young as 3 months old prefer a kind or helper puppet over a mean aggressive character
POD1000000010_S0000100	so this is like i was saying corey i always thought kids are just born to be kind
POD1000000010_S0000101	yeah but the problem for kids is that there are also a lot of barriers to kindness
POD1000000010_S0000102	for example there is a small study of 2 year olds who were exposed to another child is distress say a friend fell down on the playground
POD1000000010_S0000103	only about a 3rd of the kids actually responded in that moment with altruism with kindness by say going over to the child offering a hug calling for an adult
POD1000000010_S0000104	zachary
POD1000000010_S0000106	let us check on her bella he is trying to check on you
POD1000000010_S0000107	he is trying to help you up
POD1000000010_S0000108	yeah and we actually saw this kind of scene in person on a recent trip that we took to a preschool on the campus of eastern connecticut state university
POD1000000010_S0000109	i got hot feta
POD1000000010_S0000110	0 great let us see
POD1000000010_S0000111	what a kind friend
POD1000000010_S0000112	let me help you girl
POD1000000010_S0000114	and it really got me wondering would my kids be that one in 3 would yours
POD1000000010_S0000115	yeah i do not know i mean i really hope so
POD1000000010_S0000116	but what is it that gets in the way of that kindness that act of kindness in the moment
POD1000000010_S0000117	a bunch of things
POD1000000010_S0000118	young kids are naturally self centered
POD1000000010_S0000119	sure
POD1000000010_S0000120	every parent knows that
POD1000000010_S0000121	so they might just be oblivious to another child is pain
POD1000000010_S0000122	you know and there is also individual temperament right
POD1000000010_S0000123	so some kids
POD1000000010_S0000124	they really can not handle other kids pain they shut down
POD1000000010_S0000125	or maybe they are really shy and they are waiting for someone else to step up
POD1000000010_S0000126	you know decades of psychology research tells us this is a grown up problem too
POD1000000010_S0000127	sometimes the presence of others automatically serves as an inhibition
POD1000000010_S0000128	but there is also another more disturbing barrier to kindness that adults really need to understand here and it is prejudice
POD1000000010_S0000129	so there is another yale study of 6 to 8 month old babies
POD1000000010_S0000130	
POD1000000010_S0000131	they wanted a puppet that did not share their snack preference punished
POD1000000010_S0000132	punished
POD1000000010_S0000133	yeah so it is not just that these babies showed a preference for those who look or behave or think like they do but also a kind of hostility to those that do not
POD1000000010_S0000134	wow
POD1000000010_S0000135	yeah so for all these reasons children and grownups alike do not always reach out to help
POD1000000010_S0000136	instead we often do the opposite
POD1000000010_S0000137	it is true we hide from other people is pain we run away from responsibility
POD1000000010_S0000138	and that is why scarlett says
POD1000000010_S0000139	you do not really need the skills and tools
POD1000000010_S0000140	what you need is the courage to be with somebody in pain and just be present
POD1000000010_S0000142	and that is our 3rd takeaway
POD1000000010_S0000143	kindness requires courage
POD1000000010_S0000144	the jesse lewis choose love program for kids from pre k through high school actually begins with courage
POD1000000010_S0000145	and i want to mention that reports of the shooting said that jesse himself showed incredible courage
POD1000000010_S0000146	when the shooter stopped to reload he yelled run and the investigator said that he saved many of his classmates lives in that moment
POD1000000010_S0000147	yeah and scarlet is definition of courage is even bigger than that sort of
POD1000000010_S0000149	courage
POD1000000010_S0000151	heroic courage
POD1000000010_S0000152	for her it includes the courage to reach out to a hurting friend on the playground or a child you do not even know
POD1000000010_S0000153	yeah absolutely i mean the courage to offer comfort to someone who is lost a loved one even if the idea of death is really scary to you
POD1000000010_S0000154	it is also scarlett says the courage to stand up to someone who is bullying you or someone you know by taking their perspective and seeing the world through their eyes
POD1000000010_S0000155	gosh you know what would make you act that way
POD1000000010_S0000156	what is going on in your life
POD1000000010_S0000157	i feel compassion for you
POD1000000010_S0000158	i see the pain
POD1000000010_S0000159	is there anything that i can do to help ease that pain
POD1000000010_S0000160	you know hearing about courage in that way in that moment really spoke to me corey because i have to admit this
POD1000000010_S0000161	i was a little afraid to sit down with scarlett
POD1000000010_S0000162	i mean someone who had gone through something that i as a parent fear so much and to look that pain in the face
POD1000000010_S0000163	but the way that she has transformed that experience into a positive legacy is so inspiring
POD1000000010_S0000165	one really practical way scarlett is choose love plan builds courage is by teaching kids to stay calm
POD1000000010_S0000166	they practice brave poses and brave breaths to stand up tall like superheroes and calm down their bodies and their minds
POD1000000010_S0000167	yeah there are a few different reasons for this which make up our 4th takeaways
POD1000000010_S0000168	yeah takeaway number 4
POD1000000010_S0000169	kindness takes mindfulness
POD1000000010_S0000170	jen kotler at sesame says
POD1000000010_S0000171	and you will be less likely to lash out violently in frustration or anger
POD1000000010_S0000172	self regulation is something we all struggle with
POD1000000010_S0000173	and that is why mindfulness is so important and really learning how to manage our own emotions
POD1000000010_S0000174	and i think the earlier that we can practice those skills the better we will be in adulthood
POD1000000010_S0000175	in fact the folks at sesame are so convinced of the connection between mindfulness and kindness that they like to use a special word kindfulness
POD1000000010_S0000176	you hear that merriam webster
POD1000000010_S0000178	anyway lots of these social and emotional learning programs introduce tools like meditation relaxation yoga to help kids work on this body mind connection
POD1000000010_S0000179	so we talked about the courage that it takes to step in when someone else is hurting even if that person is being hurtful towards you
POD1000000010_S0000180	and how to cultivate that quiet in your mind that let you do that
POD1000000010_S0000181	our next takeaway is about what to do when your child hurts someone else accidentally or intentionally
POD1000000010_S0000182	or on the other hand when someone else hurts your child
POD1000000010_S0000183	takeaway number 5
POD1000000010_S0000184	apologies are a skill
POD1000000010_S0000185	and forgiveness is a gift you give yourself
POD1000000010_S0000186	yeah before jen started at sesame workshop she spent her days in a classroom
POD1000000010_S0000187	i remember when i was a preschool teacher briefly that we were told we do not force children to apologize to each other
POD1000000010_S0000188	and i remember in my early 20s thinking that is absurd
POD1000000010_S0000189	you should totally tell children to apologize to each other
POD1000000010_S0000190	the problem jen found out with forced apologies is that they are usually pretty worthless
POD1000000010_S0000191	sorry
POD1000000010_S0000192	and they do not even realize that they are supposed to mean it or feel it
POD1000000010_S0000193	yeah so tom lacona and jen cutler both told us instead of focusing on kids parroting the words sorry
POD1000000010_S0000194	we should help them really take the other person is perspective and this is important repair the harm done
POD1000000010_S0000195	yeah and this is a great tip
POD1000000010_S0000196	jen says you can actually take a moment like this
POD1000000010_S0000197	and direct one child to look at the other child is face and posture
POD1000000010_S0000198	and this helps them learn how to read feelings
POD1000000010_S0000199	so it is really about more conversations and about looking at emotions and emotion knowledge and looking at faces to see how your actions affect other people
POD1000000010_S0000200	jen says sesame street has improved over time in how it depicts apologies on the show
POD1000000010_S0000201	it now has characters discuss what went wrong and why and how to make it better
POD1000000010_S0000202	so elmo might say i was really wanting to play with my scooter and i did not want to share it
POD1000000010_S0000203	and i realized that you probably wanted a turn too
POD1000000010_S0000204	and i should let you have the time with it
POD1000000010_S0000206	you will get it zoe
POD1000000010_S0000207	but wait what about your turn elmo
POD1000000010_S0000208	elmo can be patient and wait for his turn
POD1000000010_S0000209	so what do you say zoey
POD1000000010_S0000210	then the other character would say yes that is how i was feeling that you were not sharing
POD1000000010_S0000211	and it was hurting my feelings and then when you shared it made me feel better
POD1000000010_S0000212	ha ha ha
POD1000000010_S0000214	all right nice job sharing ola
POD1000000010_S0000215	0
POD1000000010_S0000216	so in that interaction you are giving children a lot of language to describe how they are feeling
POD1000000010_S0000217	that may be a lot to expect from a 2 year old
POD1000000010_S0000218	but you know apologies are a skill kind of like learning to scooter
POD1000000010_S0000219	and they improve with practice
POD1000000010_S0000220	yeah and starting these kinds of conversations early is crucial to raising a child who runs to help when somebody is hurt
POD1000000010_S0000221	so remember that small study we mentioned of kids on the playground
POD1000000010_S0000222	well it also looked in depth at the parenting styles of their mothers in different situations
POD1000000010_S0000223	when one child heard another many of the mothers responded with something casual and bland
POD1000000010_S0000224	yeah like 0 do not do that
POD1000000010_S0000225	but the researchers found that the moms of the helper kids those one in 3 who ran to help they were different
POD1000000010_S0000226	yeah they were warm and nurturing but they also took it really seriously when their child hurt another child
POD1000000010_S0000227	so they would say something like
POD1000000010_S0000228	you hurt amy
POD1000000010_S0000229	pulling hair hurts never pull hair
POD1000000010_S0000230	and as a result the child was more likely to take it seriously later on and respond compassionately when she saw another child crying on the playground
POD1000000010_S0000231	tom also says that children should learn to make an apology of action
POD1000000010_S0000232	what we grown ups might call restitution if you break something you fix it whether it is a broken toy or a hurt feeling
POD1000000010_S0000233	this is also where things get hard for us grownups too
POD1000000010_S0000234	yeah
POD1000000010_S0000235	because all the experts we spoke with were really clear kids do what they see
POD1000000010_S0000236	and scarlett lewis says that means when parents screw up we need to apologize too
POD1000000010_S0000237	wow mom made a mistake you know
POD1000000010_S0000238	and i misinterpreted what just happened here
POD1000000010_S0000239	and i got angry i am sorry can you guys forgive me
POD1000000010_S0000240	if anything scarlett talks even more about the other side of an apology forgiveness
POD1000000010_S0000241	that is one of the 4 core values of her choose love program along with courage
POD1000000010_S0000242	and she says when she 1st pitched the program people were not sure about forgiveness
POD1000000010_S0000243	that is a very lofty topic for kids
POD1000000010_S0000244	do not you think that is a little too complicated
POD1000000010_S0000245	not at all she says
POD1000000010_S0000246	the choose love classrooms have turned forgiveness into a hands on exercise
POD1000000010_S0000247	we literally take string and scissors and we cut the cord because that is how i talk about it
POD1000000010_S0000248	like if you are angry at somebody you are attached to them with an umbilical cord
POD1000000010_S0000249	and it runs out of your side into the side of the person that you are angry at
POD1000000010_S0000250	i love this too because scarlett is really focusing on the benefit of letting go of anger
POD1000000010_S0000251	and she says you know holding onto anger it can be as bad for your health as smoking cigarettes
POD1000000010_S0000252	and it was at this point where sitting with scarlett in her kitchen her back is to her refrigerator which is covered with photos of jesse and her other son jt and we just had to ask
POD1000000010_S0000253	we have been talking about forgiveness
POD1000000010_S0000254	did she forgive the person who murdered her son
POD1000000010_S0000255	absolutely
POD1000000010_S0000257	without hesitation yeah i without hesitation i absolutely forgive him
POD1000000010_S0000259	so we have been talking about kindness in the darkest hours those moments of conflict
POD1000000010_S0000260	loss and pain hurt and anger
POD1000000010_S0000261	and those are really important
POD1000000010_S0000262	i mean that is when you really need kindness
POD1000000010_S0000263	yeah but how do you build kindness up
POD1000000010_S0000264	well if you want to really grow kind people there is a lot you can do when things are good when you are full of joy
POD1000000010_S0000265	that is our takeaway number 6 kindness grows with sunlight
POD1000000010_S0000266	what do we mean by that
POD1000000010_S0000267	you have to raise the capital of kindness
POD1000000010_S0000268	aja simmons helps run the social and emotional programs for schools in oakland california
POD1000000010_S0000269	and she focused a lot on kindness when she taught elementary school
POD1000000010_S0000270	you have to point it out
POD1000000010_S0000271	you have to name it
POD1000000010_S0000272	you have to appreciate it when you see it
POD1000000010_S0000273	for example every day she would hold circle time
POD1000000010_S0000274	and a lot of times she would ask this
POD1000000010_S0000275	you know what were some ways this week where your classmates were kind to you
POD1000000010_S0000276	turn and share a moment where you felt someone was being really kind
POD1000000010_S0000277	tom lacona says it is not just about celebrating kind actions
POD1000000010_S0000278	it is encouraging kids to identify as kind people
POD1000000010_S0000279	yeah because people are more likely to be kind if they see it as part of who they are
POD1000000010_S0000280	yeah this idea of taking special notice when people are kind to you well another word for that could be gratitude
POD1000000010_S0000281	yeah part of how scarlett keeps going she told us is by constantly reminding herself even out loud what she is grateful for
POD1000000010_S0000282	my gratitude lists are all day long
POD1000000010_S0000283	and i start in the morning by ticking off up the sun is out and up i can get up out of bed and literally like i am ticking them off all day
POD1000000010_S0000284	and when you are focused on gratitude you are not focused on the lesser energy thoughts
POD1000000010_S0000285	and tom agrees
POD1000000010_S0000286	there is a payoff to practicing gratitude in this way
POD1000000010_S0000287	not only can it raise the stock of kindness in your family in your classroom but research shows that people who are thankful are also happier
POD1000000010_S0000288	yeah he suggests that at mealtimes for example families go around and mention their gratefuls things that they are thankful for that day
POD1000000010_S0000289	yeah we do this in my house
POD1000000010_S0000291	alright who wants to go 1st
POD1000000010_S0000292	me i am thankful for animals and pandas
POD1000000010_S0000293	thank you for this food and this day and that my concert is today
POD1000000010_S0000294	it is not always easy
POD1000000010_S0000295	sometimes my guys do not really want to do it they just want to eat
POD1000000010_S0000296	thank you for this breakfast
POD1000000010_S0000297	and .
POD1000000010_S0000298	but we do it
POD1000000010_S0000299	the point of all this is to really carve out a time in each day for your kids and you to acknowledge you know we are not self sufficient
POD1000000010_S0000300	we are not islands
POD1000000010_S0000301	we need other people and other people need us
POD1000000010_S0000302	that is a great point corey i have got to try that
POD1000000010_S0000304	we have come to our final takeaway takeaway number 7 kindness requires .
POD1000000010_S0000305	practice practice practice
POD1000000010_S0000306	yeah in fact scarlett lewis says
POD1000000010_S0000307	we were going to change the name of our program from choose love enrichment program to choose love enrichment practice
POD1000000010_S0000308	and similarly tom says kindness as a virtue is not random it is a habit
POD1000000010_S0000309	and that is not just calling out kindness when you see it in your kids
POD1000000010_S0000310	it is giving them lots of opportunities to be kind
POD1000000010_S0000311	and you can start with chores at home
POD1000000010_S0000312	chores yeah that is a really good idea
POD1000000010_S0000313	so tom says you know not for an allowance but just to give the message that this is what we do to help out because we are part of something bigger
POD1000000010_S0000314	and for my daughter lulu who is 7 that chore really is taking care of the cat
POD1000000010_S0000315	you know when we got the cat she promised that she would help out not only with the feeding but also the litter box
POD1000000010_S0000316	this is really giving her the message that there is another creature depending on her
POD1000000010_S0000317	yeah totally
POD1000000010_S0000318	and you can also and should you know take this model this idea and take it out into your community
POD1000000010_S0000319	have your kids help pick up trash in the neighborhood or help folks at a shelter
POD1000000010_S0000320	raise money for a good cause whatever it is
POD1000000010_S0000322	and here is a really good news tom told us
POD1000000010_S0000323	getting our kids to be helpers to be in service it does not just benefit the grown ups that they become
POD1000000010_S0000324	doing this regularly actually feels good chemically
POD1000000010_S0000325	it is what brain researchers call helper is high
POD1000000010_S0000326	doing a kind act lights up a part of the brain that lets us experience joy
POD1000000010_S0000327	and that is why he says we are happier when we are helping and janet sesame agrees
POD1000000010_S0000328	kindness really does make you feel good
POD1000000010_S0000329	and that is why scarlett says we should talk to kids directly about this helper is high
POD1000000010_S0000330	there is so much science that shows and i say all the nurturing healing love that you give out you get back
POD1000000010_S0000331	so this is getting me thinking more about that study of middle school students that we opened the episode with
POD1000000010_S0000332	
POD1000000010_S0000333	you know our kids they hear from us every day do your homework
POD1000000010_S0000334	study for the test
POD1000000010_S0000335	how well did you do
POD1000000010_S0000336	and they hear us talk about sweating some promotion or working hard on a project
POD1000000010_S0000337	but you know do we ever stop and ask them were you kind in class today
POD1000000010_S0000338	yeah did you help somebody who is hurting or sit by that kid who always eats alone
POD1000000010_S0000339	it is no wonder our kids so often think that we value grades more than kindness
POD1000000010_S0000340	so i am thinking more about how to raise the capital of kindness at home
POD1000000010_S0000341	and we have gone through these great strategies right
POD1000000010_S0000342	yeah yeah i mean the goal here everyone we talked to said this said this word
POD1000000010_S0000343	they use the word culture
POD1000000010_S0000344	you have to create a culture of kindness whether you are talking about home or the classroom or anywhere
POD1000000010_S0000346	time for a recap on ya
POD1000000010_S0000347	all right i am feeling the love let us do it
POD1000000010_S0000348	all right
POD1000000010_S0000349	here we go takeaway number one
POD1000000010_S0000350	we grown ups need to stop sending our kids mixed messages about kindness
POD1000000010_S0000351	yeah we say we want our kids to be kind but we have got to walk the walk
POD1000000010_S0000352	takeaway number 2 kids are born to be kind but also unkind
POD1000000010_S0000353	yes so empathy is part of what makes us human but and this is a big but
POD1000000010_S0000354	there is a difference between feeling someone else is pain and actually acting to help
POD1000000010_S0000355	yeah kindness is not just a feeling it is an action
POD1000000010_S0000356	and that is why our takeaway number 3 is kindness requires courage
POD1000000010_S0000357	the courage to embrace other people is pain the courage to put other people is needs before your own
POD1000000010_S0000358	but also courage to see someone who is hurt you or a friend or someone in your family not as a bully
POD1000000010_S0000359	but as someone who is struggling
POD1000000010_S0000360	the kind of courage to see the world the way scarlett lewis does
POD1000000010_S0000361	there are only 2 kinds of people in the world good people and good people in pain
POD1000000010_S0000362	takeaway number 4 to build kindness practice mindfulness
POD1000000010_S0000363	being able to stay calm and patient will help you every time
POD1000000010_S0000364	especially when someone hurts you
POD1000000010_S0000365	so takeaway number 5 is apologies are a skill and forgiveness is a gift you give yourself
POD1000000010_S0000366	remember parents and teachers alike the old sing songy sorry it is not good enough
POD1000000010_S0000367	and when you are on the other side of the harm forgiveness may feel hard but it will also feel good in the long run
POD1000000010_S0000368	speaking of feeling good our takeaway number 6 is kindness grows with sunlight
POD1000000010_S0000369	or as jen at sesame says
POD1000000010_S0000370	we often are quick to tell children when they are doing something wrong and trying to correct them from doing something wrong
POD1000000010_S0000371	instead can we spend more time catching them doing something right catching them doing something kind
POD1000000010_S0000372	so create a culture of kindness and gratitude recognition of kindness in your home and in your classroom
POD1000000010_S0000373	and takeaway number 6 kindness takes practice
POD1000000010_S0000374	and grown ups can help with that by creating opportunities for your kids to be kind
POD1000000010_S0000375	whether that is chores at home or family service projects out in the community
POD1000000010_S0000377	and that is all for this episode of life kit for parenting with sesame workshop

POD1000000014_S0000009	he then became public service ombudsman for wales between 2008 and 2013
POD1000000014_S0000010	he has been chairman of the british and irish ombudsman association for 2 years and currently he is the president of the world board of the international ombudsman institute for the last 4 years
POD1000000014_S0000011	peter you are extremely welcome thank you for being with us
POD1000000014_S0000012	thank you rob very glad to be here
POD1000000014_S0000013	peter i am very interested to hear a bit about your early life
POD1000000014_S0000014	where were you born and tell us a bit about the values that were instilled in you when you grew up
POD1000000014_S0000015	thank you rob i was born in dublin i was born into a fairly ordinary working class home
POD1000000014_S0000016	my dad was a mechanic with the state transport company my mother was as was the case with many in the day a housewife
POD1000000014_S0000017	we lived a very ordinary family life
POD1000000014_S0000018	i did not enjoy school i was taught by the christian brothers so i have some of my learning to thank them for
POD1000000014_S0000019	but i would not say they contributed to a very happy school days but the rest of my childhood was very enjoyable
POD1000000014_S0000020	my mother would have been quite religious it was a very different ireland at the time
POD1000000014_S0000021	our house was busy there were often relatives or neighbors popping in for cups of tea
POD1000000014_S0000022	and so it was a pleasant place to grow up
POD1000000014_S0000023	so you had a community service background before going to work in local government that is correct is not it
POD1000000014_S0000024	yes i worked for the welsh housing agency when it was set up that was funding housing associations on special needs housing
POD1000000014_S0000025	but then i went to work for cardiff housing department
POD1000000014_S0000026	i was responsible for services like homelessness sheltered housing for older people and so on
POD1000000014_S0000027	and also managed the gypsy sites in cardiff so a very interesting job
POD1000000014_S0000028	but i gradually became more involved in mainstream housing through that
POD1000000014_S0000029	and then before you became welsh ombudsman you were chief executive of the arts council of wales was that good fun
POD1000000014_S0000030	it was very good fun it was at a time shortly after the creation of the welsh assembly
POD1000000014_S0000031	the government in wales was interested in nation building if you like doing things to bring people together and they saw the arts as a valuable way of doing that
POD1000000014_S0000032	from my perspective obviously i was also interested in community arts and arts outreach to people who were otherwise excluded
POD1000000014_S0000033	so it fitted very well for me i have never had any expertise in the arts but i greatly enjoyed it
POD1000000014_S0000034	and it was a very good time for the arts in wales
POD1000000014_S0000035	now i think you must be one of the very few people to have occupied national ombudsman jobs in more than one country
POD1000000014_S0000036	i do not know whether there is anyone else like you in that regard but what was it like moving from being ombudsman in wales to ombudsman in ireland
POD1000000014_S0000037	it was interesting
POD1000000014_S0000038	i think the ombudsman in wales was a very significant player in the evolution of the devolved administration in wales
POD1000000014_S0000039	but particularly the work focused within the health sphere
POD1000000014_S0000040	and an awful lot of the complaints that we dealt with were to do with clinical judgments
POD1000000014_S0000041	so moving to ireland firstly i found that i do not have jurisdiction over clinical judgment
POD1000000014_S0000042	but also i have jurisdiction over a much broader range of government services and local government
POD1000000014_S0000043	so it was similar in some ways to wales but it was a bigger job if you like
POD1000000014_S0000044	in the context of a whole national government and a different set of issues to deal with
POD1000000014_S0000045	in ireland you are also you wear many hats you are also the information commissioner
POD1000000014_S0000046	and you deal with local government standards as well
POD1000000014_S0000047	do you find that an advantage in terms of being ombudsman
POD1000000014_S0000048	it is very helpful if you are committed to the same kinds of principles you are committed to good public services you are committed to openness you are committed to transparency
POD1000000014_S0000049	those values work across all of the different hats i wear
POD1000000014_S0000050	i suppose the biggest difference is as ombudsman you make recommendations but in ireland in the history of the office they have always been implemented
POD1000000014_S0000051	as information commissioner you make binding decisions but those get challenged in the courts
POD1000000014_S0000052	so despite what many people think to be the case being an ombudsman in some ways is more effective in terms of having outcomes achieved than having binding powers as information commissioners
POD1000000014_S0000053	what would you say have been the biggest challenges to you as irish ombudsman
POD1000000014_S0000054	you have obviously successfully dealt with them because you have been reappointed for a 2nd term but looking back on the 6 years that you have had what are the biggest challenges
POD1000000014_S0000055	the biggest challenge we faced was with the investigation into the magdalene laundries
POD1000000014_S0000056	as we looked more closely at the issues there this was about women who had been held against their will
POD1000000014_S0000057	often young women who would had babies sometimes school children had been held against their will and forced to work for many years in laundries
POD1000000014_S0000058	what i was looking at was a government compensation scheme and the department of justice had chosen to interpret that scheme very narrowly
POD1000000014_S0000059	so they were excluding young women people who at the time were young women and had worked in the laundries but being detained in industrial schools which
POD1000000014_S0000060	which shared the same sites as the laundries but not technically resident in the laundries
POD1000000014_S0000061	so we looked at that and felt that there was a huge injustice but the initial response of the department was to reject our findings
POD1000000014_S0000062	so that required a high publicity campaign which ultimately led to the government changing its mind
POD1000000014_S0000063	to be fair i suspect if ministers had been involved from the outset i do not think that the rejection we initially saw would have happened
POD1000000014_S0000064	did any of the people who experienced this detriment get in touch with you or was this a nature of you seeing the unfairness and acting on their behalf
POD1000000014_S0000065	no we had a small number of cases but we investigated the whole scheme so some of the people who benefited would not even have known of my office
POD1000000014_S0000066	so that is the advantage of having the power of own initiative to an ombudsman
POD1000000014_S0000067	yes it is you can investigate
POD1000000014_S0000068	even if you get complaints sometimes you are constrained because you can only investigate on the facts if you can not undertake own initiative investigations
POD1000000014_S0000069	if something comes up that needs to be looked at there is no constraints on me looking at that
POD1000000014_S0000070	and particularly i have found that in the context of excluded groups it is a very powerful tool to use to make sure that people who do not come to you can nonetheless have access to justice
POD1000000014_S0000071	yeah and is that regarded as controversial in ireland i would not have thought so
POD1000000014_S0000072	no no it is just part of the toolkit available to the office i do not think anybody gives it any 2nd thought
POD1000000014_S0000073	now you behaved very bravely in this investigation because at one point when you were being blocked by ministers you threatened to go to the
POD1000000014_S0000075	is that right
POD1000000014_S0000076	when i was being blocked by officials i went to the minister for justice and threw him to the
POD1000000014_S0000078	the prime minister
POD1000000014_S0000079	i asked that they personally look to resolve the matter because it was such a stark injustice and reflected very poorly on the government of ireland
POD1000000014_S0000081	and the minister for justice both acted with great expediency and the matter was resolved almost immediately following their intervention
POD1000000014_S0000082	i do not think you can be an effective ombudsman without having the kind of guts that you have shown throughout this
POD1000000014_S0000083	and i hope you will sympathize with those ombudsman that do not have own initiative powers because it seems to me to be a great handicap
POD1000000014_S0000084	i think it is i mean even in a welsh context where i did not have them at the time
POD1000000014_S0000085	you could be investigating something in one health board and see immediately that it was likely that the same problems were arising elsewhere
POD1000000014_S0000086	but technically you could not extend your investigation beyond the body you were investigating
POD1000000014_S0000087	that ability to extend an investigation to cover whichever bodies are involved is very powerful
POD1000000014_S0000088	so a lot of my work let us say with asylum seekers and refugees in accommodation provided on behalf of the government
POD1000000014_S0000089	i will be looking at complaints that are to do with healthcare that are to do with access to benefits that are to do with all kinds of things access to housing
POD1000000014_S0000090	other than the services provided by the department of justice in providing the accommodation
POD1000000014_S0000091	so it is just that capacity to broaden out an investigation as well as the capacity to instigate an investigation where you do not have complaints
POD1000000014_S0000092	now my current own initiative investigation is looking at the situation of people under 65 living in nursing homes
POD1000000014_S0000093	that is become a much more pressing issue in the coronavirus crisis one of the people we have interviewed has already died another has contracted the virus
POD1000000014_S0000094	so although at this point it is not possible for obvious reasons to conclude the investigation
POD1000000014_S0000095	what we have done is written to the leaders of all the political parties who are currently involved in talks leading to the formation of a new government
POD1000000014_S0000096	to highlight the issue of people in institutional care so that at least what we have learned to date in the course of our investigation can hopefully help to shape the policies of the incoming government
POD1000000014_S0000097	can we just move on a little bit
POD1000000014_S0000098	you are the president of the international ombudsman institute which is a very important and prestigious job which is very valuable to ombudsmen all over the world
POD1000000014_S0000099	what added value do you think the ioi brings to our discussions
POD1000000014_S0000100	i think one of the very important things is straightforwardly learning from each other
POD1000000014_S0000101	being an ombudsman is necessarily an isolated role what you can not do is be too close to the people in the services which are within your jurisdictions
POD1000000014_S0000102	so consequently we have more in common with each other than we do with the people whose services we are looking at and learning from each other is very important
POD1000000014_S0000103	the ioi provides structured training opportunities that has been one of the very valuable things we have done
POD1000000014_S0000104	it provides best practice papers to show how things can best be done
POD1000000014_S0000105	and of course rob you yourself have been responsible for the best practice paper on peer review and the work you have done in that field
POD1000000014_S0000106	but also i think the ioi has played a big part in supporting ombudsman organizations under threat
POD1000000014_S0000107	we have seen for instance colleagues in many countries around the world who because they are doing their job are being threatened or ignored by their governments
POD1000000014_S0000108	and we have seen things like budgets being cut we have seen people being denounced by government ministers and so on
POD1000000014_S0000109	so the solidarity of the international ombudsman community is very important but we also intervene quite directly
POD1000000014_S0000110	i will give an example of cyprus where the auditor general was looking to interfere in the work of the ombudsman is office
POD1000000014_S0000111	following intervention from the ioi and others with the government of cyprus the parliament in particular the threats were withdrawn
POD1000000014_S0000112	in poland the ombudsman was threatened with large cuts to his budget we sent in a commission of inquiry
POD1000000014_S0000113	we interviewed government ministers we interviewed the judiciary
POD1000000014_S0000114	we carried out press conferences we talked to ngos and we managed to get a stay of execution
POD1000000014_S0000115	and so we saw major threats to democracy there but our intervention along with those of others has helped to ensure that that office is still there and is continuing to operate effectively
POD1000000014_S0000116	that polish intervention was crucial
POD1000000014_S0000117	and what is one of the remarkable things about it was that you actually went there did not just talk about it and
POD1000000014_S0000118	but you put the political institutions under pressure by asking them to give an account of what they were doing
POD1000000014_S0000119	absolutely so we did that in person and we did it through the media so that it had a very high profile within poland i think it is no good
POD1000000014_S0000120	i did the same in cyprus media interviews talking to people on the ground
POD1000000014_S0000121	i think it is really important that solidarity is not something that comes just in the form of a letter though sometimes a letter can be effective enough in itself
POD1000000014_S0000122	but that you actually scale the intervention to the nature of the challenge
POD1000000014_S0000123	we have talked about this quite a lot when we have not been on the radio but
POD1000000014_S0000124	how important do you think it is that we as ombuds do not get involved in political matters
POD1000000014_S0000125	or do you think this is a cultural relic of british imperialism
POD1000000014_S0000127	whatever about british imperialism no i think it is a very complex question
POD1000000014_S0000128	i think that for an ombudsman not to be involved in politics is scarcely possible because what we are actually doing is overseeing services provided by the state
POD1000000014_S0000129	and so therefore any comment we make on those services has the potential to be political
POD1000000014_S0000130	what we can not be is party political and what we can not do is speak beyond the evidence of our casebook
POD1000000014_S0000131	so i talked earlier on about seeking to affect the formation of the government in ireland to promote particular policies to favor disadvantaged groups of people
POD1000000014_S0000132	but i am doing that on the basis of investigations i am carrying out
POD1000000014_S0000133	i am not doing it as peter tyndall is citizen i am doing it as ombudsman of ireland based on the evidence from my case book
POD1000000014_S0000134	and under those circumstances i think it is entirely appropriate to intervene
POD1000000014_S0000135	i think it becomes problematic if people are seen to be intervening on issues which go beyond their own work as ombudsman
POD1000000014_S0000136	and i think that is where it would become problematic
POD1000000014_S0000137	but i do think that if you have got evidence then it is important that you use that evidence where it can be most effective in securing justice for the people who have come to you
POD1000000014_S0000138	so we are moving towards the end but i wanted to ask you about how you are coping with the coronavirus
POD1000000014_S0000139	what sort of impact has it had short term and longer term on the way you operate
POD1000000014_S0000140	yeah it is an interesting one
POD1000000014_S0000141	the 1st thing was that we surprised ourselves by being able to get ourselves in a position to work remotely much quicker than we might have done otherwise
POD1000000014_S0000142	i suppose if it is proved anything it is that when there is a crisis it is surprising how long term problems can be solved in a hurry
POD1000000014_S0000143	and so we have been able to operate all of our services more or less without change throughout the crisis
POD1000000014_S0000144	we have had some changes in volumes of work coming to us
POD1000000014_S0000145	we have put a bit more emphasis on project work but by and large people are able to make their complaints to us
POD1000000014_S0000146	they can ring us they can email us
POD1000000014_S0000147	they can contact us on the web
POD1000000014_S0000148	and we are even able to collect our posts though we are discouraging people from using the post at the moment but the effect of that is that we can keep going
POD1000000014_S0000149	the difficulties we face are probably more to do with the difficulties being faced by the services we are dealing with
POD1000000014_S0000150	so we have told the health service we have told nursing homes and we have told the department of social protection which deals with benefits and pensions
POD1000000014_S0000151	that we understand that it will take them longer to respond to us and that in some instances they will not be able to
POD1000000014_S0000152	so we understand that but in general we have been able to keep going
POD1000000014_S0000153	just to give an example of the kind of things we have been dealing with
POD1000000014_S0000154	we had one gentleman stuck in poland who could not get back to ireland who had been denied benefit in ireland even though his wife and children were in ireland and he normally lived and worked there
POD1000000014_S0000155	and we were able to intervene successfully so that he got his benefits so we are able to deal with issues as they arise
POD1000000014_S0000156	i think in the longer term there will be 2 things really one of them is just practical
POD1000000014_S0000157	we now know that it is possible for more of our people to work effectively from home and i can not see us going back to the situation before where only a very small number of people did that
POD1000000014_S0000158	i think more people will work from home as a consequence of what we have learned during the crisis
POD1000000014_S0000159	but the 2nd issue for me has been the appalling death toll among people in institutional care many of whom should not be there
POD1000000014_S0000160	and i think we have to redouble our efforts in working on their behalf after the crisis to make sure that should there be a resurgence or should something else like this come along
POD1000000014_S0000161	that they are not as exposed and as vulnerable as they are at the moment
POD1000000014_S0000162	it makes complete sense for the ombudsman to be looking at both health and social care matters
POD1000000014_S0000163	and not as in this country to have a separation where one ombudsman looks at social care and the other looks at health
POD1000000014_S0000164	if i may rob just add something
POD1000000014_S0000165	one of the things that is noticeably different between ireland and the uk and england in particular is that there is a single national ombudsman in ireland
POD1000000014_S0000166	so that issues of health and social care both come into my jurisdiction
POD1000000014_S0000167	the reality is these are complex interlinked issues
POD1000000014_S0000168	and trying to deal with them with 2 separate ombudsmen in the office is as complicated enough as it is
POD1000000014_S0000169	trying to do so in the context where you have mp filters
POD1000000014_S0000170	where you have different systems applying in different parts of the uk it is impossibly difficult for yourselves
POD1000000014_S0000171	but you manage it very well along with the local government ombudsman
POD1000000014_S0000172	i have to say you have managed in practice to overcome the difficulties but it is also an impossibly complex scenario for complainants
POD1000000014_S0000173	in ireland somebody wants to complain about public services they come to my office
POD1000000014_S0000174	in your case it is much more complicated
POD1000000014_S0000175	and i do hope that the proposals for ombudsman reform that we have seen in the uk over recent years are not entirely lost
POD1000000014_S0000176	and that we do come to a much more satisfactory situation where there is a proper national ombudsman and where people can bring their complaints regardless of what particular public service they are complaining about
POD1000000014_S0000177	and i do hope that happens before i die which i am increasingly becoming doubtful about but we will have to wait and see
POD1000000014_S0000178	peter you conducted the peer review of my organization and then you appeared before the select committee in parliament
POD1000000014_S0000179	so that was not an expected development
POD1000000014_S0000180	what was it like being the peer reviewer who had to go before the uk parliament
POD1000000014_S0000181	it was an interesting experience rob
POD1000000014_S0000182	i think it would have been much more challenging if i had not been quite so impressed by the quality of the service your office provides
POD1000000014_S0000183	it was not as though when we looked at the service we used a lot of objective criteria
POD1000000014_S0000184	and obviously with any office there is room for improvement but in general i was able to give reassurance to the committee as the quality of service that complainants were receiving
POD1000000014_S0000185	but also to highlight some of the deficiencies in powers and in jurisdiction that are causing you difficulties in practice
POD1000000014_S0000186	but i suppose what i would want to say i was very impressed by the quality of the people in your office
POD1000000014_S0000187	it was a very good experience they are very open with us
POD1000000014_S0000188	we talked to your staff without talking to yourself and the managers so we were able for people to express a view as they saw fit and i think people were very complimentary
POD1000000014_S0000189	so i think as i say it was an interesting experience
POD1000000014_S0000190	it is always challenging to go before parliamentary committees the session was quite searching
POD1000000014_S0000191	i think the committee wanted to reassure itself that this was not some kind of hagiography
POD1000000014_S0000192	but we were satisfied in the end that we were able to say no we have looked in detail at this office
POD1000000014_S0000193	there are areas which can improve but by and large this is an improving service that is delivering good quality ombudsman service to the people of england and to the uk
POD1000000014_S0000194	well i think the structural point is that thanks to the ioi this whole system of peer review looks like it has legs for the wider ombudsman community
POD1000000014_S0000195	and it is an effective and inexpensive way of adding to scrutiny of ombudsman schemes so thank you for the role that you played in pioneering that
POD1000000014_S0000196	one thing beyond that too rob is that
POD1000000014_S0000197	since the review was undertaken the ioi along with other bodies have worked quite hard
POD1000000014_S0000198	with the venice commission and the council of europe in developing a set of overriding principles for ombudsman offices the venice principles as they have become known
POD1000000014_S0000199	and they have now been adopted by the council of europe
POD1000000014_S0000200	and that is the 1st time there has been a proper international standard against which ombuds offices can be judged
POD1000000014_S0000201	and so i am keen to see them being used as they are being used now in the context of peer reviews
POD1000000014_S0000202	so that there is an objective set of internationally recognized standards against which you are measuring a particular ombudsman office
POD1000000014_S0000203	so i think that is again marks another step forward and one that i am very pleased to have seen develop
POD1000000014_S0000204	i think when i undertook the peer review of the catalonian ombudsman with my belgian counterpart
POD1000000014_S0000205	we used those very same venice principles as a benchmark against which to judge the catalonian ombudsman
POD1000000014_S0000206	and it is very helpful to have that because it is without prejudice
POD1000000014_S0000207	it applies to everyone so i think it is an important development
POD1000000014_S0000208	so 2 final questions how have you peter tindall reacted to working remotely being at home with your family
POD1000000014_S0000209	i have enjoyed it to be honest
POD1000000014_S0000210	it has not been too frustrating the technology can be an issue from time to time but it has not been too difficult
POD1000000014_S0000211	it has been less difficult than i would have expected
POD1000000014_S0000212	and as time goes on i think the issue of visible leadership comes into it does not
POD1000000014_S0000213	so you know you actually want to be with your people again but it is worked surprisingly well
POD1000000014_S0000214	and .
POD1000000014_S0000215	as i say i think for the office itself i think we will see more remote working in the future
POD1000000014_S0000216	thank you so lastly then what i always ask my guests
POD1000000014_S0000217	what advice would you give to young colleagues newly arriving as caseworkers in the embryonic ombudsman profession
POD1000000014_S0000218	for me there is a couple of characteristics that have to be embodied by people working in the service or as an ombudsman
POD1000000014_S0000219	we have to be objective we have to be fair
POD1000000014_S0000220	we have to be even handed so the 1st advice often is make sure you know the whole story before you reach a conclusion
POD1000000014_S0000221	but underpinning all of that i would say that if you have not got a passionate commitment to justice then you are in the wrong job
POD1000000014_S0000222	because what this fundamentally is about is people who believe in fairness people who believe in justice and people who want to use their own efforts to make sure that nobody is denied access to justice
POD1000000014_S0000223	and that is what we are here for
POD1000000014_S0000224	thank you so much peter
POD1000000014_S0000225	your answers were stimulating and also inspirational
POD1000000014_S0000227	we are all very grateful for the time you have given for this interview
POD1000000014_S0000228	thanks a lot
POD1000000014_S0000230	my next guest will be the catalonian ombudsman rafael ribo
POD1000000014_S0000231	so he will be joining us from barcelona
POD1000000014_S0000232	in the meantime this is rob behrens on behalf of radio ombudsman and saying have a good day and stay safe
POD1000000017_S0000001	from the new york times magazine i am nicole hannah jones this is 1619
POD1000000017_S0000003	this week wesley morris on the birth of american music
POD1000000017_S0000005	so last fall i am at my friend is house we are making dinner i am chopping vegetables and i asked my friend brett who was cooking with me can you put on some music
POD1000000017_S0000006	and he said what do you want to listen to and i said have you ever heard of yacht rock and he said what i said yacht rock have you ever heard of this and he goes no i have not
POD1000000017_S0000007	so he finds the yacht rock station in pandora which i do not know why or how he is still a pandora guy with all due respect to pandora he is one and he finds the iraq station
POD1000000017_S0000009	at some point bright has to go run an errand i think i might have sent him on one i do not remember but he has gone so i am alone just me with the vegetables and yodrock
POD1000000017_S0000011	it gives me plenty of time to really think about the songs i am hearing
POD1000000017_S0000013	we are talking about music made between the years of i do not know i would say like 1975 to about 1983 things like .
POD1000000017_S0000015	aces how long
POD1000000017_S0000017	seals and croft doing summer breeze i am hearing things like
POD1000000017_S0000019	steal away by robby dupree
POD1000000017_S0000021	and the doobie brothers what a fool believes
POD1000000017_S0000023	it is like our soft raucous period in american popular music
POD1000000017_S0000025	the joke of yacht rock is that whoever invented it whoever is making a playlist out of these songs is basically saying that they are inconsequential and that what is in them does not matter
POD1000000017_S0000027	but what i know i am hearing is something bigger and deeper than that
POD1000000017_S0000029	every song has something about it that is similar to the other songs
POD1000000017_S0000031	i am hearing things like rosanna by toto
POD1000000017_S0000033	which seems perfectly banal has a really good beat it sort of builds to its chorus
POD1000000017_S0000035	but then at the end
POD1000000017_S0000037	i am hearing
POD1000000017_S0000039	the great doo wop harmonies of the 50s and 60s
POD1000000017_S0000041	there is something jazz like in the syncopated music of something like steely dan
POD1000000017_S0000043	you can hear in somebody like michael mcdonald
POD1000000017_S0000045	that is like a gospel breakdown
POD1000000017_S0000047	what i am hearing in all of these songs is basically blackness
POD1000000017_S0000049	and the song in which i am hearing it the deepest and strongest and most powerfully at least to me standing in that kitchen chopping those vegetables was when kenny loggins this is it comes on
POD1000000017_S0000051	it has got a kind of loosely disco like rhythm to it there is a lot of percussion sort of going back and forth and around
POD1000000017_S0000053	kenny loggins is basically sing whispering the verses of this song
POD1000000017_S0000055	doing this very light
POD1000000017_S0000056	cool
POD1000000017_S0000058	and then in the pre chorus kenny loggins disappears and who shows up michael mcdonald
POD1000000017_S0000060	giving kenny loggins plenty of time to gather himself
POD1000000017_S0000062	when he sings the word miracle he does not sing miracle he goes miracle
POD1000000017_S0000064	like he is scraping the bottom of a pan to get all of the good bits off of it before you pour the gravy in
POD1000000017_S0000066	scraping the pan is the blackest thing you can do as a singer and here is kenny loggins as this white artist doing it
POD1000000017_S0000068	and then the gravy comes
POD1000000017_S0000070	he is like at the top of the church at this point
POD1000000017_S0000071	he has like elevated himself to the rafters there is like no more he is like at the roof trying to clear a way to get to heaven but there is just church roof in the way
POD1000000017_S0000073	he is not the greatest singer but there is a kind of gumption and nerve to the singing of this song
POD1000000017_S0000075	that cannot be denied a tip of the hat to him
POD1000000017_S0000076	i just had to stand there and i just i actually cracked up i just put down the knife and i cracked up and it felt so pleasurable and then i started thinking about all these other singers i love
POD1000000017_S0000078	i am thinking about amy winehouse
POD1000000017_S0000080	i am thinking about annie lennox
POD1000000017_S0000082	think about george michael
POD1000000017_S0000084	i think about chris stapleton
POD1000000017_S0000085	who practices a kind of muscly blues that gets written off his country because he is a big white guy in a hat
POD1000000017_S0000087	and one of the many phases in which david bowie really wanted to make r b and soul music
POD1000000017_S0000089	this is the sound not just of black america but the sound of america it is deeply american almost especially when it is sung by british people like david bowie and annie lennox and amy winehouse
POD1000000017_S0000090	and it fills me with pride like i know that there is something irresistible and ultimately inevitable about black music being a part of american popular music
POD1000000017_S0000091	but it also reminds me that there is a history to this a very painful history and in the most perversely ironic way it is this historical pain that is responsible for this music
POD1000000017_S0000093	some of the oldest recordings we have of black american music are from the 1930s
POD1000000017_S0000094	and they are songs that would have been sung by americans born into slavery there is this one called old ship of zion
POD1000000017_S0000095	you can hear in it these 4 men their voices are moving in and out of each other
POD1000000017_S0000097	and it is beautiful and it is also sad you can feel that in your bones
POD1000000017_S0000098	and then there would be music that was completely the opposite like old coon dog for instance
POD1000000017_S0000100	you can hear the playfulness in the song
POD1000000017_S0000102	and you have got this banjo this great african instrument that becomes the bedrock of american music in so many ways and that thing is dancing
POD1000000017_S0000103	and then you have someone like billy mcrae
POD1000000017_S0000104	and 0 my god you can hear in his singing what we would now call something like the live long day
POD1000000017_S0000106	years and years of hard work
POD1000000017_S0000107	and unimaginable sorrow
POD1000000017_S0000109	you can also hear in all of this music
POD1000000017_S0000111	this undeniable sound of hope
POD1000000017_S0000113	all of these melodies and cadences and emotions are things that would have been passed down generation after generation it is what you would have heard on a plantation it is what you would have heard walking by a plantation
POD1000000017_S0000114	it is what you would have heard passing a black person doing his job entertaining himself doing the drudgery of work the way a guy named thomas dartmouth rice did sometime around the 1830s
POD1000000017_S0000115	as the story goes t d rice a white man this anonymous nobody actor trying to make ends meet
POD1000000017_S0000116	one day he is touring with a troop in cincinnati or maybe it was pittsburgh we do not really know but the myth basically goes t d race happened upon an old black man cleaning a horse in a stable
POD1000000017_S0000117	the man was doing his job on property owned by a white man named crow
POD1000000017_S0000119	he heard the tune this old black man was singing he saw the way this man moved his body as he was cleaning this horse
POD1000000017_S0000120	now we do not know what tune this old man would have been singing
POD1000000017_S0000122	whatever reiss hears coming out of this man is mouth is captivating to him and what he sees is an opportunity
POD1000000017_S0000124	because showbiz in the 1830s looked like this
POD1000000017_S0000126	italian operas
POD1000000017_S0000128	british plays entertainment imported from europe all the people performing this stuff would have been white the audiences would have been white
POD1000000017_S0000129	after all it is 1830 slavery is in full effect
POD1000000017_S0000131	and when it came to entertainment there was nothing new nothing truly american
POD1000000017_S0000133	and so when t d rice hears this black man singing this song and moving his body in this particular way ding a light bulb goes off
POD1000000017_S0000134	and he takes that light bulb and runs all the way to the theater he figures out a way to melt down some cork
POD1000000017_S0000135	let us it cool presumably takes a rag or maybe even his hand if it is cool enough
POD1000000017_S0000137	and then he paints his face black
POD1000000017_S0000139	he goes out on stage but instead of doing his regular act he has got this horse groomers tune except now he is given the tune lyrics
POD1000000017_S0000140	come listen all you gals and boys i am just from tuckahoe i am going to sing a little song my name is jim crow
POD1000000017_S0000142	and the lyrics give the horse groomer a name and the name is jim crow
POD1000000017_S0000144	so the crowd goes crazy they go so bananas the man gets 20 encores
POD1000000017_S0000146	this is the 1st time a paying audience is basically electrified by a white man with a black face this is the night that jim crow was allegedly introduced to america this mascot of american racism
POD1000000017_S0000147	and this is what america really wanted which was its own original art form that is not an italian opera it is not some british guy coming over and that is being all over them
POD1000000017_S0000148	and here is thomas dartmouth rice giving it to them this is the night that american popular culture was born
POD1000000017_S0000150	0 boy i mean you know how it goes this sensational thing happens and then everybody wants to get on the bandwagon and do their own
POD1000000017_S0000151	so you have other minstrel acts who come along and try to do what thomas dartmouth rice is doing a song and a dance
POD1000000017_S0000152	and a black face on their white skin
POD1000000017_S0000154	and then from these solo acts you have basically bands forming
POD1000000017_S0000156	and the bands have all the instruments that you would have in a band that you would recognize now there is a banjo and a fiddle and some tambourines and percussion in the form of bones which would come from a pig sometimes
POD1000000017_S0000157	that is the formation of what will become the minstrel troupe
POD1000000017_S0000159	and the place that minstrelsy took hold was in the north
POD1000000017_S0000160	places like philadelphia and new york and boston where you would have these theaters dedicated to minstrel acts where minstrel acts would just move into a theater and do their act night after night after night after night after night
POD1000000017_S0000161	and a lot of these performers have never been meaningfully south to have a meaningful relationship with black people and so they just made stuff up based on what they thought black people were like
POD1000000017_S0000163	they were able to draw on things that were coming to america from other parts of europe like the polka
POD1000000017_S0000165	and so you had over the course of the formation of this culture an inherent mixing you had some amazing mix of an imagined blackness
POD1000000017_S0000166	real actual irish melodies and polish music with what we would now call gospel but spiritual harmonies interlaced together with this african banjo
POD1000000017_S0000168	basically welding into a fusion that becomes the thing that everybody wants to try to do
POD1000000017_S0000170	the whole thing just sweeps the nation and for the rest of the 19th century this is the shit can we say that
POD1000000017_S0000172	and so for the rest of the 19th century this is the shit
POD1000000017_S0000174	this is america is primary form of entertainment people are going crazy for black faced minstrels you have little boys going to bed and dreaming about how they can become part of this minstrel show
POD1000000017_S0000175	some of those people having these dreams go on to become people like stephen foster
POD1000000017_S0000177	stephen foster the man widely credited as being the father of american music
POD1000000017_S0000179	some of his songs some of his most famous songs songs you know songs you love songs you still sing songs your children if you have them they still sing some of those songs were written for blackface performers
POD1000000017_S0000181	and if you listen to something like camp town races you can hear in it all of its minstrel properties
POD1000000017_S0000183	the song of course is written in so called negro dialect i mean instead of saying go in you are saying gwine
POD1000000017_S0000185	like instead of saying 0 f for of you get a lot of d e for duh
POD1000000017_S0000187	this is a white person imagining how a black person would sing this song
POD1000000017_S0000188	and that was a gold rush era hit
POD1000000017_S0000190	this is the i want to hold your hand of 1851
POD1000000017_S0000192	part of the problem that we still live with now is that it was so much the heart and soul of american culture that it was not that it became not racist
POD1000000017_S0000193	it just was a thing that you did if you wanted to be an entertainer at any point after 1830 you in all likelihood were at least going to try to be a blackface minstrel even if you were black
POD1000000017_S0000195	after the civil war ends and there is an opportunity for black people to perform they have to do what the nation wants and what the nation wants at that point is blackface
POD1000000017_S0000196	and now giving you noise in tempo
POD1000000017_S0000197	f b miller and scatman corolla
POD1000000017_S0000198	so black people blacked up and performed as black people who were not actually black
POD1000000017_S0000200	by the time you have black people painting their faces black to perform as black people the only question you can really ask at this point is what the hell is going on why is this happening
POD1000000017_S0000201	what was so captivating about seeing black people represented this way why would a white audience have clamored for it so much i think one of the things that it offered was an opportunity to feel good about a thing that actually felt really bad at the time
POD1000000017_S0000202	people were really torn about whether to continue with slavery or whether to abolish it the minstrel show did not really give you an answer
POD1000000017_S0000203	but it provided a platform by which you could either escape from actually having to think about that question that really was tearing the nation apart or depending on which show you would wind up seeing
POD1000000017_S0000204	it fully engaged you in the lightest possible way about enslaved people and how you did not really have to feel so bad for them because they like being enslaved you got to laugh at a thing that you actually felt so anguished about
POD1000000017_S0000205	you get to watch these black people who are really a source of national agony outside the theater become fools inside the theater and in sitting in that theater watching these white men in blackface make fools of black people
POD1000000017_S0000206	a white audience could feel cultured they could feel civilized they could feel superior to the people they were watching be made fun of
POD1000000017_S0000207	and in a crazy way watching them dehumanize what really have been an opportunity for a white audience to feel so much better about their own humanity
POD1000000017_S0000209	by the time you get to the 20th century minstrelsy is still with us it is the basis upon which american movies are built this country is 1st movie blockbuster
POD1000000017_S0000210	d w griffith is the birth of a nation full of white men villainously in blackface
POD1000000017_S0000212	and america is 1st talking motion picture
POD1000000017_S0000214	the jazz singer about a jewish man who feels most himself not as a jewish man struggling with his jewish identity and pleasing his cantor father no no
POD1000000017_S0000216	it is when he blacks his face up and performs mammy as a negro
POD1000000017_S0000218	some of america is favorite stars did numbers in blackface
POD1000000017_S0000220	judy garland performed in blackface
POD1000000017_S0000222	bing crosby and fred astaire both performed in blackface
POD1000000017_S0000224	white christmas has a whole number the most famous number in white christmas involves a blackface tune
POD1000000017_S0000226	but at the same time there is the beginnings of a recording industry and you had black artists who had access to recording studios
POD1000000017_S0000227	out of these recordings you have people like muddy waters
POD1000000017_S0000229	inventing and perfecting blues rhythm blues ideas blues expression the expression of
POD1000000017_S0000231	of a fully human black self in american popular art
POD1000000017_S0000233	he had a kind of confidence that most people would never have heard coming from a black person before
POD1000000017_S0000235	and this is just the beginning
POD1000000017_S0000237	you have the advent of a place like blue note records where lots of amazing jazz was created and then released into the world people like sidney bechet
POD1000000017_S0000239	ruby armstrong
POD1000000017_S0000241	and duke ellington
POD1000000017_S0000243	you have black musicians thinking about how to move not only music forward but american culture forward
POD1000000017_S0000245	thinking about how these instruments can do other things besides make what we think of as western european classical music
POD1000000017_S0000247	taking music to a place that nobody had ever tried to previously take it
POD1000000017_S0000249	people who just kept pushing it forward and beyond
POD1000000017_S0000251	and then you have the development of the single most important movement black people have ever had artistically
POD1000000017_S0000253	and that is the advent of motown records
POD1000000017_S0000255	motown is the most powerful mass produced expression of black glamour of black self confidence of black self reliance
POD1000000017_S0000257	its project was to get black producers black musicians black singers to take quote white quote western musical ideas of orchestration strings and horns
POD1000000017_S0000259	in straightforward harmonies
POD1000000017_S0000261	and you marry them to a black weekend
POD1000000017_S0000263	where on saturday night you are at a juke joint having a good time with rhythm and blues music guitar and drum and bass
POD1000000017_S0000265	sex basically
POD1000000017_S0000267	and then you go home slightly hungover
POD1000000017_S0000269	and you wake up and you go to church on sunday morning
POD1000000017_S0000271	where there is a whole other musical experience involving hand claps and different harmonic arrangements and call and response
POD1000000017_S0000273	a lot of feeling a lot of oomph a lot of gratitude
POD1000000017_S0000275	you have the combination of these 3 different areas of musical expression happening at the same time in just about every single motown record
POD1000000017_S0000277	and whether it is the 4 tops doing reach out i will be there
POD1000000017_S0000279	or martha and the vendellas doing heatwave
POD1000000017_S0000281	on something like heat wave you can hear hands slapping the tambourine like it actually is sunday morning
POD1000000017_S0000283	then when everything is firing
POD1000000017_S0000285	it is just the most exciting romantic sound you are ever going to hear and at the center of it is what can only be described as a refulgent tasteful blackness
POD1000000017_S0000287	here you have in motown a force that is actively combating these ideas of black people as being inherently inferior
POD1000000017_S0000289	motown is the antidote to american minstrelsy
POD1000000017_S0000291	and this is what i was thinking about standing there in that kitchen chopping those vegetables it is the thing that made me laugh was just how all that history is
POD1000000017_S0000292	is just very silently coursing through this music it might not even be aware that it is even there it is so thoroughly atomized into american culture it is going to show up in ways that even people making the art can not quite put their finger on
POD1000000017_S0000294	what you are hearing in black music that is so appealing to so many people of all races across time is possibility struggle it is strife it is humor
POD1000000017_S0000295	it is sex it is confidence and that is ironic because this is the sound of a people who for decades and centuries have been denied freedom
POD1000000017_S0000296	and yet what you respond to in black music is the ultimate expression of a belief in that freedom the belief that the struggle is worth it that the pain begets joy
POD1000000017_S0000297	and that that joy you are experiencing is not only contagious it is necessary and urgent and irresistible black music is american music
POD1000000017_S0000298	because as americans we say we believe in freedom and that is what we tell the world and the power of black music is that it is the ultimate expression of that belief in american freedom
POD1000000018_S0000000	when andy griffith passed away in 2012 cnn covered his death off and on the entire day
POD1000000018_S0000001	you have all seen this type of news coverage before an overview of the career images of the star in their prime phone in conversations with other celebrities who were close with the departed
POD1000000018_S0000003	larry king is one of the people who called in to talk that day he would had andy on his various shows numerous times and he mentioned something in passing that is really interesting
POD1000000018_S0000005	what larry said is that a lawyer named percy foreman was the man who inspired the character matlock
POD1000000018_S0000007	this was a weird thing for anyone to say because most people even today believe that character to be based on a different lawyer named bobby lee cook
POD1000000018_S0000009	however in 20153 years after larry king said something that most people would assume was incorrect the creator of matlock did confirm that the character was based on percy foreman
POD1000000018_S0000010	a criminal defense attorney from houston texas who lost only 53 of the 1500 cases where clients of his faced the death penalty with only one of those losses resulting in an actual execution
POD1000000018_S0000012	percy was able to achieve this record by being an incredible lawyer no denying it but also due to the texas court system is practice of using juries to determine guilt as well as sentencing in the case of a guilty verdict
POD1000000018_S0000014	so instead of one judge who is heard it all before determining his client is fate
POD1000000018_S0000016	percy had 12 average citizens from the local community sitting right there waiting to be convinced that the victim in this situation was not a victim at all
POD1000000018_S0000017	they were up to no good the community was far better off without that element in it and even if his client had killed him well hell they needed killing
POD1000000018_S0000019	foreman called it misdemeanor murder that is where a jury might convict you of ending another person is life and send you on your way with the type of punishment you would receive for a misdemeanor crime
POD1000000018_S0000020	often nothing more than probation no time at all it is essentially a sanctioned form of vigilante justice
POD1000000018_S0000021	percy foreman had such a long run of wins with this strategy that it is still being used in texas today people who have conversations about this sort of thing will sometimes refer to it as the texas defense
POD1000000018_S0000023	now jim denny was not from texas he was from tennessee
POD1000000018_S0000024	the buffalo valley area about 60 miles east of nashville was a real poor area to be born in 1911
POD1000000018_S0000025	when a 16 year old jim denny got hired to work the mailroom of wsm radio is parent company he must have seen it as an opportunity to make something out of himself
POD1000000018_S0000027	denny got this job in 1927 that year the young radio program wsm barn dance was referred to as the grand ole opry for the 1st time on air
POD1000000018_S0000029	every time an odd job came up at the opry jim would take it so he could hang out backstage see the artists and see how the show was made
POD1000000018_S0000030	within 20 years denny had worked his way up to director of the artist service bureau at wsm which meant he was in charge of booking the acts on the opry
POD1000000018_S0000032	there is a few funny things from jim denny is time at the grand ole opry like the one about elvis presley is big debut
POD1000000018_S0000033	elvis was still a teenager when denny did sam phillips the favor of letting elvis come on the show to play his not country arrangement of blue moon of kentucky
POD1000000018_S0000035	it did not go well denny is rumored to have told elvis backstage you aint going nowhere son you ought to go back to driving a truck
POD1000000018_S0000037	denny is also the guy who fired hank williams over the telephone and there is the time when jim made johnny cash wait outside his office for 2 hours before letting him in to ask why cash should be allowed to play on the opry
POD1000000018_S0000039	cash mentioned that he presently had a song called i walk the line in the top 10
POD1000000018_S0000041	jim denny was what many people referred to in those times as a hard man today i think they would have some different words for him and that is why ernest tubb tried to shoot him in 1957
POD1000000018_S0000043	you are listening to cocaine and rhinestones the podcast about 20th century country music and the lives of those who gave it to us
POD1000000018_S0000044	my name is tyler mahan coe i have heard these stories my whole life
POD1000000018_S0000045	as far as i can tell here is the truth about this one
POD1000000018_S0000047	it is shocking to hear ernest tubbs name associated with any kind of violence whatsoever
POD1000000018_S0000049	there are plenty of stories about him but most of them are about how great of a guy he was he had an adorable nickname e t and you can hear admiration in the voice of everyone who calls him that
POD1000000018_S0000051	crisp texas is a ghost town now ernest tubb was born there in 1914 into a family of sharecroppers like most sharecroppers children ernest grew up working on farms all over the area
POD1000000018_S0000052	long days in the field entertainment from a stereo in the evenings an early bedtime and you get back up the next day to do it all over again typical day for a sharecropper
POD1000000018_S0000054	like a great number of artists we will learn about in future episodes it was all over for a 14 year old ernest tubb the 1st time he heard jimmy rogers sing
POD1000000018_S0000056	the obsession was instant and it would steer the course of the rest of his life
POD1000000018_S0000058	hearing jimmy rogers is what led ernest tuff to decide he simply had to become a country singer
POD1000000018_S0000059	it is also very specifically what caused him 3 decades later to want to shoot a .357 magnum at jim denny
POD1000000018_S0000061	in 1933 jimmy rogers died young of tuberculosis he was 35
POD1000000018_S0000062	the death of his idol was extremely upsetting for ernest however it also made him realize that he was going to have to get serious about chasing his dreams
POD1000000018_S0000063	he moved to san antonio made a few guest appearances on a friend is radio show and managed to secure his own early morning show which aired twice a week not bad for a 19 year old kid
POD1000000018_S0000064	but do not get the wrong idea he was nowhere near the big time and the pay was quite slim
POD1000000018_S0000066	e t had to keep 2 other jobs besides the radio gig some days he was a ditch digger and other days a drugstore clerk
POD1000000018_S0000067	holding down 3 jobs at once was necessary to support himself and his young wife elaine they did not waste any time before starting to have kids either
POD1000000018_S0000069	ernest was more than happy to work hard if it kept him moving towards the life of his hero jimmy rogers
POD1000000018_S0000070	he would had this small picture of jimmy for years now and it was in pretty bad shape so he got a phone book and looked up the number for jimmy rogers widow carrie
POD1000000018_S0000071	he called her on the phone to explain that he was such a big fan and to see if she happened to have a bigger better photo of jimmy that ernest could have maybe even one that was autographed
POD1000000018_S0000072	carrie was super nice and she did have such a photo that ernest could have and went so far as to invite him out to her house in carriville texas to get the picture
POD1000000018_S0000073	ernest drove out there the next sunday he was not working taking elaine and their baby justin on the trip
POD1000000018_S0000075	they would planned to stay for maybe 10 minutes and ended up hanging out for over 2 hours looking at costumes guitars and pictures brought out by missus rogers hearing her stories about how high on the hog they would lived merely a few years earlier
POD1000000018_S0000076	e t could never have guessed when he woke up that morning that he would be laying down to sleep that night having held jimmy rogers signature martin acoustic guitar with jimmy is name inlaid in pearl across the fretboard and the word thanks written on the back upside down
POD1000000018_S0000077	so he could flip it over to show audiences
POD1000000018_S0000079	choose your biggest dead hero and try to think of how you would feel if a similar experience happened to you it is mind blowing
POD1000000018_S0000080	okay now add this on top of that a few months later kerry rogers called ernest to say she would listened for his radio show as he would asked for her to do
POD1000000018_S0000081	on one hand she offered to help et out with the access she still had to music business big shots
POD1000000018_S0000082	on the other hand she did not think he sounded like jimmy rogers when he sang which is basically the only thing in the world ernest hub wanted to do in this phase of his life
POD1000000018_S0000083	and everyone around him had told him that is exactly what he had been doing the whole time
POD1000000018_S0000085	anyway she still hooked e t up with elsie mcwilliams the writer of a few great jimmy rogers songs
POD1000000018_S0000086	ernest tubb made a couple of records that did not sell very well did some touring and ended up back home doing low paying radio again and working 2 or 3 side jobs like before driving around a beer truck was one of them
POD1000000018_S0000088	after a while back at home ernest had to have his tonsils taken out he would later say the doctors told him not to sing or yodel for a while after the surgery but he did not listen
POD1000000018_S0000089	jumping right back into his normal routine we injured his throat
POD1000000018_S0000091	it changed his voice forever
POD1000000018_S0000093	ernest held a self deprecating sense of humor about his own voice for the rest of his life he loved to say that 9 out of 10 guys sitting in bars around the country could sing much better than he could
POD1000000018_S0000094	i do not know if he really believed that it is always been strange to me i think george jones indisputably the greatest country singer in history is exactly what happens when you add ernest tubbs new singing style and roy acuff is voice together
POD1000000018_S0000096	you just heard some earnest here is a little roy acuff from 1942
POD1000000018_S0000098	now george jones would have told you hank williams was his favorite singer you do not get hank without ernest and roy i have seen lefty frizzell named as an influence on george
POD1000000018_S0000099	lefty borrowed from ernest as well however you want to say we got to george jones it always comes back to roy acuff and ernest tubb
POD1000000018_S0000100	now the part of earnest you can hear in george is the tendency to hold on to a note for longer than you would expect picking the melody up and putting it back down in ways that are impossible to predict when hearing them sing a song for the 1st time
POD1000000018_S0000101	no matter if it is a song you have heard performed by other people
POD1000000018_S0000102	here is george in 1956 doing his own composition just one more
POD1000000018_S0000104	both versions of the song are great
POD1000000018_S0000106	it is possible ernest really did not like his new voice about a 10 people disagree with his opinion he had that tonsillectomy in 1939
POD1000000018_S0000107	in 1940 he had his biggest hit walkin the floor over you this song is still synonymous with the name ernest tubb
POD1000000018_S0000108	if someone only knows one ernest hub song it is usually this song
POD1000000018_S0000109	we would like to introduce a man who has become a legend in his own time
POD1000000018_S0000110	e t was finally big time
POD1000000018_S0000111	the texas troubadour ernest tubbs
POD1000000018_S0000114	he joined the grand ole opry in 1943 and formed the 1st incarnation of the texas troubadours
POD1000000018_S0000115	tubb would stay working for the rest of his life so members of the texas troubadours would be replaced every now and then
POD1000000018_S0000116	buddy emmons jack green billy bird leon rhodes and cal smith are only some of the notable players who joined the band on their way up the ladder
POD1000000018_S0000118	this was the 1st way ernest found to extend a helping hand to younger musicians like the hand kerry rogers had held out to him
POD1000000018_S0000119	but your dad made all those guys household names
POD1000000018_S0000120	yes he did
POD1000000018_S0000121	justin tubb
POD1000000018_S0000122	he was the 1st one to call names out on record and he loved doing that he loved the guys and they were a big part of his show i mean and he wanted to make sure they got the credit for it
POD1000000018_S0000123	and so he started calling their names out when they took a course but he was never jealous of anybody in his band outshining him he did not mind that at all as he proved with jack green and cal smith
POD1000000018_S0000124	and of course he had the wilburys with him for a while and skeeter worked some dates with him george jones stonewall jackson and he was always pushing them and he like roy i think understood that the bigger they became the bigger he became
POD1000000018_S0000125	george jones and stonewall jackson were never texas troubadours justin meant et took those guys out on tour with him as opening acts to help them build their own following and often he did a lot more than that
POD1000000018_S0000126	yeah i i do not have many but but i have one earnest
POD1000000018_S0000127	johnny paycheck
POD1000000018_S0000129	ernest one time i was hanging around the streets and it was snowing and buddy emmons took me on to meet him i always wanted to meet him
POD1000000018_S0000130	and i had met him but i mean i wanted to sit and talk with him and they was getting ready to go on tour and i did not have anywhere to stay you know i was at that stage in my life
POD1000000018_S0000131	and evidently buddy had told him that
POD1000000018_S0000132	the caller said we got on he said i talked to him a while i was you know and he said well it is about time to leave he said yeah
POD1000000018_S0000133	he said are you working asked me if i was working i said no he said you are now he was gone on like 10 days out in texas and it was snowing here in nashville and i had nowhere to you know i just i was in that place where i was you know
POD1000000018_S0000134	he took me on the road wound up and gave me a suit i did not have nothing to wear so he gave me one of his old suits and took it to the cleaners and i had it cut down the 1st day we got in texas
POD1000000018_S0000135	and it was so there was 2 pockets in the back that is how much i had to take up but it was a and i have still got a picture of me in that suit
POD1000000018_S0000136	and he let me go out and i opened his show for him for 10 days and he fed me and at the end of the tour gave me some money so that is the kind of guy he was
POD1000000018_S0000138	you can not tell the hank snow story without talking about ernest tubb e t told johnny cash not to smile when he performed folsom prison blues so people in the audience could really feel the song
POD1000000018_S0000139	cash never forgot the advice hank williams senior was heavily influenced by ernest is music and ernest is the one who convinced the grand ole opry to bring hank back after his 1st failed audition
POD1000000018_S0000140	et got hank to promise he would not touch any booze for 3 months to swing that one
POD1000000018_S0000141	in 1947 enough radio listeners wrote letters complaining of not being able to find his music that he launched the ernest tubb record shop in nashville if you could not make it there in person they would ship records directly to you
POD1000000018_S0000142	it was a game changer for country music fans and would help keep the music alive when rock and roll steamrolled america in the 50s
POD1000000018_S0000144	the record shop operated at a loss of $10000 a year for the 1st 2 years it was open but ernest knew how important it was and he kept it alive
POD1000000018_S0000145	the opry was a great promotional tool for him and he would started his own show on wsm in the following time slot when the opry was over fans could stay tuned in for the midnight jamboree
POD1000000018_S0000147	ernest played host to opry stars and newcomers alike making sure to remind you this music was available for mail order from ernest tubbs record shop he took the chance to keep jimmy rogers memory alive pitching his records as well
POD1000000018_S0000149	ernest never grew out of his fascination with jimmy rogers and never stopped repaying his debt to jimmy is widow carrie jimmy is death had left carrie in a pretty bad financial situation but she still got money from the sales of his records which were declining
POD1000000018_S0000150	he realized the more jimmy rogers records sold the better off carrier would be so e t pushed those records as hard as he could
POD1000000018_S0000151	kerry loaned and eventually flat out gave him that guitar of jimmy is which is why you will frequently see pictures or videos of ernest tubb playing a guitar that says jimmy rogers on it
POD1000000018_S0000152	in 1953 ernest helped found the jimmy rogers memorial festival in rogers hometown of meridian mississippi that is a stand up guy
POD1000000018_S0000154	you can find plenty of people who will say the same thing about jim denny
POD1000000018_S0000155	remember jim poor kid from tennessee worked his way up from the mailroom to become director of artist services at wsm and manager of the grand ole opry
POD1000000018_S0000156	director of artist services was a fancy way of saying he booked the musical acts that played on the radio station as well as the opry
POD1000000018_S0000157	denny was a powerful man in nashville and he acted like he knew it
POD1000000018_S0000158	where ernest tubb built a reputation for helping young musicians jim denny had a reputation for acting like a dick
POD1000000018_S0000160	the johnny cash et gave advice to is the same johnny cash who had to wait 2 hours outside denny is office
POD1000000018_S0000162	jim denny might not have been a dick he could have simply been a businessman who paid more attention to the bottom line than how many friends he had
POD1000000018_S0000163	denny is the guy who had to be convinced to let hank senior onto the opry and he is the guy who called hank to fire him over the telephone but ernest tubb was standing in denny is office when that phone call was made
POD1000000018_S0000164	he said he saw tears in jim is eyes
POD1000000018_S0000165	hank had missed a scheduled opry appearance most likely for no good reason other than that he was drunk denny said he thought firing hank would make him realize he needed to get his act together
POD1000000018_S0000166	that is not what happened hank williams died 4 months after being dismissed from the opry it is tragic but you can see how jim denny thought he was doing the right thing in that situation
POD1000000018_S0000167	this is important to recognize because the year hank williams died is the same year that jim denny formed cedarwood publishing with webb pierce
POD1000000018_S0000169	if you do not know what a publishing company is it used to be the heart of the record industry on the surface a publishing company is purpose was to make sure sales royalties were going to the right place
POD1000000018_S0000170	they took a big percentage to do this so anything that could be done to make a hit out of one of their writers songs they would do it and if they forgot to send you your whole royalty check sometimes well shit happens
POD1000000018_S0000172	roy acuff and fred rose had started acuff rose music back in 1942
POD1000000018_S0000173	so many country writers were being screwed over by publishing companies based out of other cities that there needed to be one in nashville an honest publishing company run by country artists for country artists
POD1000000018_S0000174	they were the best game in town until jim denny formed cedarwood in 53
POD1000000018_S0000175	as head of artist services at wsm and manager of the grand ole opry jim denny controlled who got to play in the opry their place in the lineup and how long they got to play
POD1000000018_S0000176	can you see where this is headed
POD1000000018_S0000178	if jim denny owns a country music publishing firm while retaining singular control of the most popular country music radio program in america then he is essentially printing his own money
POD1000000018_S0000180	once he has got a writer signed to cedarwood then he is getting a huge piece of any money their songs make if that writer also wants to be a performer congratulations you are on the grand ole opry tonight
POD1000000018_S0000181	if the writer does not want to be your performer congratulations webb pierce is the biggest star on the opry and he is playing your song on the grand ole opry tonight
POD1000000018_S0000182	roy acuff was pissed off and he did not stay quiet about it he said denny was giving the best spots to his own artists artists signed to acuff rose had a tendency to see roy is point
POD1000000018_S0000183	artist signed to cedarwood had a tendency to think jim denny was not doing anything wrong weird huh
POD1000000018_S0000184	long story short in 1956 wsm fired jim denny over his conflicts of interest
POD1000000018_S0000186	he started a booking agency and signed most of the opry artists some of whom had resigned when denny was fired then denny contacted the philip morris tobacco company
POD1000000018_S0000187	their competition in the cigarette business r j reynolds was a sponsor of the grand ole opry
POD1000000018_S0000188	so when jim denny called with a chance for them to get their product associated with all those acts philip morris wrote a check big enough to fund the biggest country music package tour anyone had ever seen
POD1000000018_S0000189	half the grand ole opry lineup these fans listened to every saturday night was coming to stages across america for live appearances
POD1000000018_S0000190	with philip morris paying for everything the admission was even free
POD1000000018_S0000191	it looked as though everyone was getting what they wanted until the philip morris country music show booked a stop in meridian mississippi on the same week as the 5th annual jimmy rogers memorial festival
POD1000000018_S0000192	but it was worse the philip morris show would take place on the 2nd night of the 2 day jimmy rogers festival
POD1000000018_S0000194	for 5 years ernest tubb had worked to grow the jimmy rogers festival from scratch this is a tremendously difficult thing to do e t put in the effort to honor his idol
POD1000000018_S0000196	jim denny was not simply setting up shop across the street with some healthy competition
POD1000000018_S0000197	he brought a free show to town on the same night with half the grand ole opry lineup and several big names you would have had to buy a ticket to see on the jimmy rogers event the previous night
POD1000000018_S0000198	it is hard not to see that as a giant middle finger can you imagine what would happen if coachella set up a festival 8 miles away from bonnaroo on the same weekend for free
POD1000000018_S0000199	it would crush bonnaroo this was such a big deal that they did not even have the jimmy rogers memorial festival the following year
POD1000000018_S0000200	they regrouped to put one on again in 1959 but kerry rogers health had already taken a turn for the worse and ernest tubb was never involved with the festival again
POD1000000018_S0000202	mostly a kind man e t was different when he had been drinking a beer or 2 while gambling with the guys he would be fine but it was the times when he would get to drinking for a whole day or 2 or 5
POD1000000018_S0000203	mirrors would get smashed windows broken he had a thing about glass apparently
POD1000000018_S0000205	according to billy bird ernest tubbs reaction to the philip morris country music show undercutting the jimmy rogers memorial festival was to get drunk and stay drunk for the better part of a week
POD1000000018_S0000206	they carted him back to nashville but he was still drinking and he was still mad as hell at jim denny
POD1000000018_S0000207	finally he called denny at home in the middle of the night to cuss him out denny said something like well if you are so mad about it then how about you just meet me down at wsm right now and we will settle things for good
POD1000000018_S0000209	that sounded like a great plan to ernest tubb he strapped on a gun belt with bullets and a .357 magnum in the holster and drove downtown in his cadillac wearing house slippers
POD1000000018_S0000210	meanwhile when jim denny had hung up the phone he simply took it back off the hook again so ernest could not call him anymore and then went back to sleep
POD1000000018_S0000212	so ernest tubb is drunk off his ass with a loaded gun when he stumbles into the lobby of the national life building where wsm was located
POD1000000018_S0000213	it is close to 5.30 in the morning people are starting to show up for work
POD1000000018_S0000215	there is more than one version of what happened next the gun gets fired in all of them
POD1000000018_S0000217	bill williams the news director at wsm says he was walking into work when a gunshot rang out in the lobby and a bullet went over his head into the wall
POD1000000018_S0000218	he turned around you know pretty scared and saw ernest hub standing there in his house slippers with a revolver
POD1000000018_S0000220	when he asked ernest what the hell he was doing ernest said my god i have shot the wrong man
POD1000000018_S0000221	whether or not he had been actively trying to kill anyone we will never know for certain it seems to me like he thought he had successfully shot someone and was only upset that someone was not jim denny
POD1000000018_S0000222	either way ernest settled down after thinking he would shot an innocent person bill williams called his boss jack dewitt to tell him what happened jack told bill to take ernest home
POD1000000018_S0000223	he would have except the police had been called as soon as other employees heard a gunshot in the office building
POD1000000018_S0000225	ernest hubb went to jail for drunken disorderly plus carrying the weapon
POD1000000018_S0000226	it was mandatory to hold public intoxication arrestees for 3 hours
POD1000000018_S0000227	so ernest bought cigarettes for all the other inmates and sang songs with them while bill williams waited to take him home
POD1000000018_S0000229	$60 bond got him out and that was the end of that
POD1000000018_S0000231	jim denny is name was kept out of the papers though everyone in the business could read between the lines and see who ernest had wanted to shoot
POD1000000018_S0000233	the incident seems to have had no effect on ernest tubbs career whatsoever apparently if all e t was trying to do was put a bullet in jim denny then that was fine
POD1000000018_S0000235	his career lasted into the 1980s he was still doing over 200 dates on the road a year and he only quit in 1982 because of problems from his emphysema
POD1000000018_S0000236	in 1984 his lungs killed him just like his hero jimmy rogers
POD1000000018_S0000238	the midnight jamboree still airs every saturday night and you can still buy music from ernest hub is record shop or online at etrecordshop com
POD1000000018_S0000240	we are told that in 1963 ernest hub made up with jim denny before jim passed away from cancer the jim denny artists bureau stayed in business for only a few more years
POD1000000018_S0000242	jim denny was inducted to the country music hall of fame in 1966 cedarwood jim denny is publishing company was sold to mel tillis in 1983
POD1000000018_S0000243	ernest tubb had been inducted to the country music hall of fame in 1965 while he was still alive

POD1000000018_S0000250	before i get to the liner notes segment of the post show you can email any questions you have about this episode or the podcast or me or life in general to questions at cocaineandrinestones com
POD1000000018_S0000251	if enough people send in questions then i will make a q a episode to close out the 1st season all right liner notes
POD1000000018_S0000252	okay 1st of all if i did not make it clear it is impossible to overstate ernest tubbs importance to country music
POD1000000018_S0000253	aside from influencing basically everyone who matters he was one of the 1st if not in fact the 1st artist to bring an electric guitar player with him onto the grand ole opry stage
POD1000000018_S0000254	if you want to call it honky tonk and it happened after ernest tubb it was influenced by ernest tubb before i get to the story in the episode i would like to address one other thing
POD1000000018_S0000255	in the 1980s clyde moody tried to start an alternative association to the country music hall of fame called the country music pioneer association
POD1000000018_S0000256	the cmpa had a trashy newspaper that clyde essentially used to rant against the industry and print whatever shitty rumors people sent in
POD1000000018_S0000257	among these rumors was one that ernest tubb died broke and alone in a cheap downtown motel shunned by the country music world he had done so much to help
POD1000000018_S0000258	this rumor is still spread as fact and i do not believe it is true
POD1000000018_S0000259	charlie luvin even has it in his autobiography which is not the only thing charlie got wrong in that book but i will talk about that another time
POD1000000018_S0000260	1st of all the source was ernest tubb is estranged wife next ernest died owning 70% of the ernest tubb record shop which had multiple locations running and was very profitable at that time he was not a broke man
POD1000000018_S0000261	that is just that is not realistic
POD1000000018_S0000262	i believe ernest chose to turn visitors away because he was wasting away of emphysema and did not want anyone who loved him to have that as their last memory of him
POD1000000018_S0000263	i do not remember who it was but someone actually did get in to see him and they point blank said they wish they had not gone to see him
POD1000000018_S0000264	they could tell he was uncomfortable about it and they were uncomfortable about it and they do not like having that be their last memory of him so he was trying to avoid that
POD1000000018_S0000265	and i think justin said that people would go would try to see ernest and he would tell justin to tell them thank you but he would rather not have the company
POD1000000018_S0000266	so you know i mean the end i do not think that ernest hub died you know in a sad state of affairs i think that he did well
POD1000000018_S0000268	i think he did a lot for country music and i think he went out the way that he wanted to go it seems like to me okay back to ernest hub and jim denny
POD1000000018_S0000269	what about this story was that crazy it is just so many things the roots of country music are just growing all over this story you got jim denny showing up right as the grand ole opry is becoming a thing
POD1000000018_S0000270	ernest hub gets in there and his throat is broken so he can not do what he wanted to do his whole life which is imitate his hero
POD1000000018_S0000271	and then his throat gets broken and so now he has got to create this new thing and he ends up influencing fucking hank williams senior and like everyone that is that is crazy it is amazing i love this story
POD1000000018_S0000272	i will not even try to pretend to remember the 1st time i heard this story it gets around you know
POD1000000018_S0000273	at least the part about ernest hub getting drunk and going down to the radio station with a gun and shooting and firing off around into the wall you know
POD1000000018_S0000274	people always bring that up as an example of how wild and crazy these old guys were everybody laughs about ernest getting hauled off to jail and ultimately getting away with causing a little bit of trouble you know boys will be boys
POD1000000018_S0000275	and nobody ever seemed to know why it happened and that is all i ever really wanted to know people would tell you the story and just like well why did he do that well i do not know who cares it is just funny it is like well i wanted to know so i found out
POD1000000018_S0000276	thanks to ronnie pugh is very well done biography on ernest hub that finally had the story for me and the big jimmy rogers festival thing why that affected ernest so deeply that was in there
POD1000000018_S0000277	the most detailed account of bill williams version of the lobby shooting was in there
POD1000000018_S0000278	i went with bill is version because a he was the news director of wsm with a reputation for being able to throw away that day is news script and ad lib the news without making a mistake
POD1000000018_S0000279	and b he was the one right in the middle of it you know he called his boss at home he went with ernest to the jail shout out jim farney everyone else just seemed like a bystander trying to get their name involved you know
POD1000000018_S0000280	like a security guard saying that he told ernest to put the gun away and ernest fired it off to dare the security guard or whatever you know i mean
POD1000000018_S0000281	no offense if you are a security guard but i have hung out with a lot of security guards and you all are full of shit so i am going with the news director guy
POD1000000018_S0000282	also i am aware there are different revisionist history type opinions about how well elvis presley is debut on the grand ole opry did or did not go
POD1000000018_S0000283	my thing is he did not get an encore you know that is a fact he did not get an encore he was a special guest and special guests almost always get an encore so the fact that he did not get one

POD1000000018_S0000294	i know i am going to keep coming back to this book for future episodes a lot of what i got out of that for this was about denny is firing because pretty much everywhere else you hear people talk about denny getting fired
POD1000000018_S0000295	they are all like yeah i do not know it was just like weird no one really knows why he got fired or you have got artists who were with cedarwood saying jim denny got railroaded

POD1000000018_S0000298	i mentioned that hank senior was heavily influenced by ernest tubb but also some of the most charming stuff i have ever read about hank is the way he acted around ernest
POD1000000018_S0000299	you know they were peers they were contemporaries hank was influenced by him but then he you know got to come to the show
POD1000000018_S0000300	and be a part of the big time and you just get the idea that he was just like a kid in a candy store around ernest tubb you get the idea that he just really loved being around this guy and he could not help messing with him he was always screwing with ernest
POD1000000018_S0000301	ernest hub song walking the floor over you hank williams took that image of walking the floor and put it in your cheating heart you know you will walk the floor like i do

POD1000000018_S0000309	there is a book called andy and dawn with the confirmation of percy foreman inspiring matlock
POD1000000018_S0000310	percy is no longer alive and his new york times obituary had some other interesting information that i did not know
POD1000000018_S0000311	like jack ruby asked percy foreman to defend him after shooting lee harvey oswald but then there was this communication error like
POD1000000018_S0000312	jack ruby is people told jack that foreman wanted like 5 times as much money as he ever asked from anyone or something so he was like well screw that i will go someone else
POD1000000018_S0000313	and foreman seemed disappointed that he did not get that case so i guess he wanted that but foreman did represent martin luther king junior is assassin james earl ray
POD1000000018_S0000314	but only long enough to convince him to plead guilty so yeah james did not get away with that
POD1000000018_S0000316	0 yeah the texas defense thing i have spent a lot of time in texas and this defense thing is so effective there
POD1000000018_S0000317	that i went into this episode with the understanding that that was actually a law like that is a statute on the books in texas
POD1000000018_S0000318	people who have lived in texas their whole lives believe they live in a state with a law called the he needed killin law and i know that because these people have told me that
POD1000000018_S0000319	and yeah i always just thought it was a law in texas like you can straight up murder a motherfucker if they deserve it you know if they have got it coming
POD1000000018_S0000320	you shoot them they are dead he needed killing this is still the wild west do not mess with texas
POD1000000018_S0000321	it was only after uncovering the percy foreman matlock connection that i learned that it was really just a legal defense strategy that works so incredibly well there it may as well be a law
POD1000000018_S0000323	it is pretty intense
POD1000000018_S0000325	i think that is it 0 next week if you are listening to this early i am just putting this up on the website and if you happen to listen to it early

POD1000000018_S0000330	see you there
POD1000000022_S0000000	hello everyone i am stephen west this is philosophize this thank you to everyone that supports the show on patreon and thank you to the people that do not support the show by going through the amazon banner you can find out more about both those things on the front page of philosophizethis org
POD1000000022_S0000001	apologies for the voice and my lack of execution today i am just getting over a cold but it had been too long since i had graced you with my voice and i wanted to give you guys this today is episode is part 6 in a series on sartre and camus i hope you love the show today
POD1000000022_S0000003	so in a culture where there is so much social currency connected to being a victim and having some burden that you carry around with you throughout your life there may be some of you out there that feel a little left out of all that maybe you are the kind of person you look at yourself you do not feel like a victim
POD1000000022_S0000004	maybe you do not sit around poised waiting to make other people aware of some bad thing that happened to you in the past well enough of that crazy talk get off the bench because your uncle steve is putting you in the game i am here to tell you do not worry my friend you are a victim you really are
POD1000000022_S0000005	turns out we are all victims just by virtue of being born because just think for a 2nd about how horrible the world was for us when we were all babies think of what it is like being a baby
POD1000000022_S0000006	imagine going through something similar today and if you made it on the other side tell me you would not be part of some sort of advocacy group for the people that are currently going through it think about it you did not choose to be born imagine being rounded up against your will and being rocketed off to some alien planet you know nothing about
POD1000000022_S0000007	you find yourself once you get on that planet absorbed into some foreign tribe you do not speak the language you have no idea what anything is you think the remote control of their tv is food you are completely defenseless and who do you have as teachers on this journey and
POD1000000022_S0000008	what just some random man and woman that happened to look like you did not go to school for this stuff being a baby being a baby is like going to the world is worst community college i do not even have teachers they just pull some random people off the street and say hey teach these kids about rocket science go
POD1000000022_S0000009	except it is worse than that we are not just learning about rocket science we are learning everything about what it is to exist how we look at other people how we look at the world how we look at ourselves within that world what i am saying is the struggle for us former babies out here was real
POD1000000022_S0000010	and i think it is safe to say that when you are living in the middle of this chaotic world as a baby just trying to figure things out no one is really blaming you for just sort of going along with a lot of the ways people were doing things around you
POD1000000022_S0000011	there is a lot to figure out and a lot of these ways we have learned to make sense of stuff are totally arbitrary a lot of the ways we think about stuff have just been sort of almost by accident passed down from generation to generation philosophers realized this
POD1000000022_S0000012	and at the time of sartre for over 300 years people have been pointing out how many of the ways we look at things in the western world are largely derivative from the way christianity describes being a human being
POD1000000022_S0000013	that is how entrenched religion was in the lives of people back then and that even if you have never been to church even if your family is 15 generations removed from ever having stepped foot in a church some of these things are so foundational that generation after generation of confused baby trying to figure things out
POD1000000022_S0000014	just went along with certain assumptions about existence that have their origins in christianity for example there is a certain revelatory way that a lot of people look at important crossroads in life for example they will say
POD1000000022_S0000015	okay so i need to choose a career path for my life i need to declare a major big decision what do i do well whenever i close my eyes and think about what i want i honestly do not know what i want i can not make that big of a decision yeah i have narrowed it down to a few things
POD1000000022_S0000016	but how can i ever know
POD1000000022_S0000018	like i am spending hours a day thinking about this stuff i have faith it is going to come to me someday i have faith that i am going to wake up one day something is going to happen to me some life event is going to occur
POD1000000022_S0000020	i am going to realize my calling in life in that moment people do the same thing with relationships they will say i have this vague idea up in my head of my one and only someone do not know exactly what they look like do not know exactly what they are going to be like but i am confident one day i am going to meet someone
POD1000000022_S0000021	and there is going to be this moment when i look at them and i realize they are the person i want to spend the rest of my life with people do this with anything they will do it with motivational videos on youtube one day i am going to watch the right person screaming at me to be a better person
POD1000000022_S0000022	and from then on out it is going to be easy for me to go to the gym and eat pine cones for the rest of my life in other words there is a certain revelatory way that some people look at life choices that some thinkers believe is a long lost relic of the revelatory way we used to think about the nature of existence
POD1000000022_S0000023	that a reasonable expectation to have when navigating your life is that one day you are going to wake up and there is going to be some event some miracle that you witness some transcendent moment where you realize the divinity of jesus
POD1000000022_S0000024	if you have any further questions about the nature of existence just you know forward them to the pope is inbox that is a reasonable thing to expect in that worldview well this is not the only example of these long lost remnants of christianity in our thinking
POD1000000022_S0000025	and another major one another one that a lot of people in today is world still use to make sense of things is the way that they look at themselves and who they are just like in christianity where yes you have a body but your true self is a soul
POD1000000022_S0000026	it is an eternal spirit hidden deep down within that body that you have an intimate access to just like that a lot of people in today is world think of their true self or the answer to the question who are you as a personality hidden deep within us that only we and our closest friends have access to
POD1000000022_S0000027	you know they will say things like sure when i am out in public i do kind of put on a mask to other people for the sake of social utility i mean i do not act like my 100% true self in the starbucks drive thru
POD1000000022_S0000028	yeah i tell people things they want to hear i play the game because look the fact is it is just not useful to
POD1000000022_S0000029	not to mention i do not really feel comfortable giving 100% of my true self to the person in the starbucks drive thru who am i really though well that is something i reserve for my family and my closest friends in fact even some of my closest friends do not know everything about the depths of what it is to be me
POD1000000022_S0000030	maybe for some of you out there there is only one other person in this entire world that has full access to your true self hidden deep within you but sartre would say is this really how the self works
POD1000000022_S0000031	is the self really like the christian soul hidden somewhere deep within you that only you have access to sartre would say it very well may be that you put on a mask when you go out in public for the sake of pragmatism and it very well may be that you have reflected on yourself
POD1000000022_S0000032	and you have this idea up in your head of who you are that is only accessed by you and your closest friends but do not ignore the possibility that there are multiple levels of deception going on there maybe you are telling yourself a story you want to hear the same way you are telling the starbucks barista story
POD1000000022_S0000033	this concept is a common one in existentialism it is actually one of the main themes in dostoevsky is book crime and punishments the idea that you know we often think we know a lot more about ourselves than we actually do in practice 2 examples of this
POD1000000022_S0000034	bear with me for a 2nd on the 1st one it is a little cartoonish but i think it is a really good example to pull us out of this conditioned way we often look at the self and it gets us to honestly start asking this question where is this self that we are talking about really located
POD1000000022_S0000035	1st example imagine a guy that thinks he is napoleon you know he spends all day every day dressing up in parisian military garb he builds a bunker out of couch cushions in his front room agonizing to himself how am i going to conquer moscow
POD1000000022_S0000036	that guy now this man believes beyond a shadow of a doubt that he is napoleon if you sat him down and you ask him candidly no but who are you really deep down inside he would say i am napoleon bonaparte commander the armies of the north
POD1000000022_S0000037	husband to a murdered wife father to a murdered son and i will have my vengeance but is this man really napoleon we know he is not napoleon in fact in a weird way as outsiders we seem to have an advantage when it comes to knowing who he really is
POD1000000022_S0000038	interesting here is the less cartoonish example and try to think about how this applies to you imagine a guy sitting on the couch watching tv with his pals they turn on the news and there is a story about some mass shooting that happened at a walmart somewhere
POD1000000022_S0000039	he hears the story gets kind of angry turns to his friends and says you know what that guy and people like him they better hope they never show up at my walmart someone pulls out a gun when i am there i am not going to be one of those people on the news chopper camera screaming and running out of the store
POD1000000022_S0000040	i am going to the sporting goods section i mean i am going to go up into the rafters like i am tom cruise and snap the dude is neck i am going to do this because that is just the kind of person i am that is me i would sacrifice my life for the greater good now he may tell his friends this
POD1000000022_S0000041	he may believe that that is who he is deep down beyond a shadow of a doubt but if next saturday he is out shopping with his family someone pulls out a gun and all his wife and kids see is a poof of smoke and then he is running out the back door who is that guy really
POD1000000022_S0000042	in other words when we reference this thing we call ourself intuitively it can feel like well i am myself i know who i am so no one can tell me who i am but me
POD1000000022_S0000043	in fact if you just recited that statement in most public settings people would be like yeah yeah you tell them only you know who you are deep down inside but is that a delusion is that just a narrative that we tell ourselves to simplify this concept of the self
POD1000000022_S0000044	sartre says that when you take a closer look at the self it is not a soul it is not a personality hidden deep within you what we are referencing when we talk about the self turns out to be much more complex than that with many more moving parts
POD1000000022_S0000045	and i think a good place to begin if we want to understand sartre is views on what the self really is is to talk about 2 foundational aspects of what it means to be a human being that to sartre seem to be constantly intertwined and dependent upon each other what he calls our facticity
POD1000000022_S0000046	and our transcendence if you are a human being that is alive right now you have both facticity and transcendence put very simply our facticity is the collection of facts that are true about us at any given moment
POD1000000022_S0000047	and transcendence is our ability to change the possibilities that we have at our disposal let us break it down further though remember last time when we talked about being in itself versus being for itself being in itself as being kind of like matter this inert featureless blob of existence
POD1000000022_S0000048	fully affirmative and being for itself as being consciousness or the source of all negation well one day when sartre was trying to meet his monthly quota for obscure sounding philosophical descriptions the way he describes the relationship between these 2 ontological categories is that being in itself quote
POD1000000022_S0000049	quote is what it is and being for itself quote is what it is not well as weird as that sounds in a vacuum after listening to last episode we all know what he means when he says it but then sartre points out something very mysterious a very strange coincidence
POD1000000022_S0000050	when you look at the relationship between these 2 ontological categories 2 things that are easy to write off as just these meaningless abstract concepts that start to cook up one day when you look at how being in itself and being for itself relate to each other
POD1000000022_S0000051	sartre notices there seems to be a similar sort of relationship at the foundation of who we are as people see because on one hand all of us have our facticity and facticity is kind of like being in itself it is the fully affirmative set of facts that are true about us
POD1000000022_S0000052	you ask me who i am and oftentimes i will state the facts about myself 0 i am 117 years old that is a fact i am a horse wrangler by profession that is a fact i make $28000 a year i drive a ford focus
POD1000000022_S0000053	i am scared of spiders things like that right in other words statements of facts that are currently true about us that is what makes up our facticity but what sartre would want us to consider is that while these kinds of statements are no doubt useful when it comes to describing certain pieces of who i am and
POD1000000022_S0000054	they never tell us the full story and the reason why is because human beings are far more complex than that to fully understand a human being just by default is to understand a type of being that has possibilities none of us are pure facticity in other words
POD1000000022_S0000055	the only time a human being is pure facticity is when they are dead yes we have a set of facts that are true about us right now but we always have the ability to change into something else and if we are trying to describe the self if we are trying to look at the whole picture of who someone is
POD1000000022_S0000056	the choices we make about which of these possibilities we are going to bring about end up being just as important as the facts about who we are right now for example if i am going to school to become an it consultant or if i am training for a marathon or if i am losing a bunch of weight for wedding pictures
POD1000000022_S0000057	a big part of understanding who i am is understanding the thing i am actively trying to change into an it consultant a marathon runner in other words part of understanding the full picture of me is understanding what i am not yet
POD1000000022_S0000058	you can start to hear the weird star trek description creeping in there just like being in itself is what it is and being for itself is what it is not in a sense i am what i am i have a facticity but i also am what i am not yet
POD1000000022_S0000059	when i consider my transcendence just like being in itself and being for itself these 2 aspects of what it is to be a human being facticity and transcendence are entangled intertwined and in some cases reliant on each other for the very existence
POD1000000022_S0000060	your facticity and transcendence are constantly affecting each other and that is because the facts of your life are oftentimes caused by what possibilities you decide to bring about and the possibilities you have decided to explore are almost always limited by the facts of your life
POD1000000022_S0000061	let us stop at the hypotheticals and just give a real example all right me i will use me as an example i am 6 feet tall £172.2 this morning now no matter how much i want to
POD1000000022_S0000062	i am never going to become a horse jockey this is not going to happen for me as long as there is people out there that are 4 8 £85 the facticity that i am a certain height and weight limits my ability to transcend and the result of that is
POD1000000022_S0000063	i have never went in the kentucky derby it is not happening this is an example of how our ability to transcend is oftentimes limited by the facts about us another example i was born with a particular face and a particular ability to put on muscle
POD1000000022_S0000064	no matter how much i want to i am never going to be an instagram model the facticity of my face my my face ticity and all the other stuff going on there
POD1000000022_S0000065	look i will never be the kind of person that people want to voluntarily look at and then click an emoji that signifies how they are feeling about the most recent picture of me this is not going to happen and these facts about me are the parameters i live my life and exercise my freedom within see because that is the thing and this goes for all of you out there
POD1000000022_S0000066	when sartre talks about radical freedom when any of us talk about being individuals that are free to act as they choose we are never talking about total freedom right it is always freedom within certain limitations
POD1000000022_S0000067	you know we often say things like i can do whatever i want to do but you can not really do anything you want to do right i mean ultimately you are a human being you can not wrap yourself in a protective cocoon and then emerge a unicorn in 3 days you can not fly to the edge of the universe and look at what is on the other side
POD1000000022_S0000068	no freedom is always freedom within certain limitations and it is those limitations that give a lot of what you choose to do in life its value we see this in all the various different forms of art you know when someone writes a really good haiku
POD1000000022_S0000069	we see it as good not because they are the greatest words that could have ever been possibly strung together no the beauty of a haiku is because we understand that we have given an artist total freedom within a set of limitations that we impose
POD1000000022_S0000070	5 syllables 7 syllables 5 syllables go in other words the limitations are a big part of what makes the haiku beautiful and this applies to life as well
POD1000000022_S0000071	the facticity that you were born into your own individual limitations are always going to affect the possibilities that you have and what you ultimately choose to do with your life so try to live your life like it is a piece of art you are creating
POD1000000022_S0000072	but yeah ultimately the point sartre is making here with the concepts of facticity and transcendence is not only to stop thinking about yourself as though it is this artifact hidden deep within you inside of a vault but also stop thinking about who you are as though it is this static
POD1000000022_S0000073	unchanging thing that you can point to the point that he is making is that who you are is always in a state of constant change sometimes small changes sometimes bigger changes but changing and in flux but do not go extreme in the other direction
POD1000000022_S0000074	do not start thinking of yourself as this ethereal thing that can never be defined again all the way up until the day you die when you are finally turned into total facticity you will always have certain facts that are true about you and certain possibilities at your disposal to bring about
POD1000000022_S0000075	unless if you are dead you have never arrived at a destination as a human being now at 1st glance this may seem like sartre is writing a self help book no no single fact about you sums up who you are release your inner transcendence no
POD1000000022_S0000076	no like we touched on last time sartre thinks that when people are truly faced with the number of these possibilities they are free to choose from most of the time they do not get excited they are horrified by it in fact most of the time once people realize this stuff they are going to be like
POD1000000022_S0000077	sartre thinks that the secret covert desire of everyone whether they realize it or not is to escape this duality it is to turn themselves into either pure facticity or pure transcendence or as sartre says we all secretly want to become god
POD1000000022_S0000078	let us talk about what he means by that think about the way followers of the abrahamic religions have traditionally looked at god what is it like to be god well god is perfect god is in this moment everything he will ever be if god had a job interview and the person asked him what is one thing you would change about yourself
POD1000000022_S0000079	god literally does not have an answer to that question but then on the other hand god is all powerful with the snap of his fingers he can do anything he wants to do in other words in this old style traditional view of what god is on one hand
POD1000000022_S0000080	god is perfect as he is pure facticity but on the other hand god is all powerful and capable of bringing about any possibility he wants in other words pure transcendence sartre would say this is no coincidence
POD1000000022_S0000081	and it is also no coincidence that as people navigate their lives they have all sorts of tactics they use to turn themselves either into somebody that ignores their possibilities and are perfect as they are right now or someone who ignores the very real unfortunate facts about themselves
POD1000000022_S0000082	and they stay lost in these unattainable dreams their entire life this is the context we needed to understand a concept we talked about well over a year ago on the one episode we did on sartre the primary tactic that people use in their lives to turn themselves into either pure facticity
POD1000000022_S0000083	or pure transcendence like god is what sartre calls bad faith let us take a look at the most famous example of bad faith that sartre lays out and because we already talked about it in the other episode i will keep it brief
POD1000000022_S0000084	sartre talks about sitting in the middle of a cafe in paris watching a waiter as he does his job now you can imagine a waiter in the 1940s right dressed up in his little outfit very upright good posture very proper
POD1000000022_S0000085	he holds the tray in a particular way he walks and changes direction in a very militaristic particular way like a good waiter does sartre can not help but point out that this guy does not seem to be a self with facticity and transcendence in this moment
POD1000000022_S0000086	he seems to have relegated himself to just playing the part of a waiter he is going through the motions trying to turn himself into pure facticity just a waiter and nothing else now even though waiters do not act like this often in today is world
POD1000000022_S0000087	go to most restaurants and you can find some modern version of what sartre is talking about here i mean there is so many servers out there that have fallen into bad faith and are just sort of playing the role of the same person it seems to be a modern archetype of what it is to be a server they all say the same stuff
POD1000000022_S0000088	hi i am john i am going to be taking care of you today can i get you guys started with a bottomless bucket of shrimp or some drinks or something but it is at every stage of the meal how is everything tasted for you guys you all save room for dessert now there is absolutely no rush i am going to leave the check here i am going to go over there
POD1000000022_S0000090	ask yourself is this the way this guy talks to his mom is this the way he talks to his best friends no he is fallen into bad faith and is just playing the part of a server now the point sartre is making is not that waiters need to be more creative it is not about waiters
POD1000000022_S0000091	sartre thinks that as human beings we have a tendency to gravitate towards this trap in all aspects of our life we make proclamations about what we are all the time i am a stay at home mom that is my identity
POD1000000022_S0000092	i am a libertarian i am a mormon and that is that what we are desperately trying to do with these proclamations is give ourselves an essence in a world where existence precedes essence
POD1000000022_S0000093	all these things are just us wanting to think about ourselves as some static thing set in stone and run from the possibilities that we have no when we take an honest look at the possibilities at our disposal it terrifies us and it produces a feeling called nausea
POD1000000022_S0000094	and we use bad faith to quell this feeling of nausea we are constantly doing this with ourselves now if all you ever read was sartre is being and nothingness you might get the read from the book that this tendency we have to gravitate towards bad faith is
POD1000000022_S0000095	is an inescapable condition of being a human being and that even when we are self aware of the bad faith we are engaging in we are still engaging in bad faith if all you ever read was the main text of being and nothingness you might get that impression and it certainly sounds like a really sad picture .
POD1000000022_S0000096	but in one of the footnotes of being and nothingness sartre alludes to a way out of all of it and perhaps to an ethics that he would write later on in his life well he never writes an ethics and it may be because you know his lifelong partner
POD1000000022_S0000097	and fellow existentialist simone de beauvoir produces what many consider to be the greatest existentialist approach to ethics called the ethics of ambiguity next episode is part 2 on simone de beauvoir so we are going to be talking all about it but enough of bad faith let us get back to answering this question who am i
POD1000000022_S0000098	really here is the thing when it comes to these concepts of facticity and transcendence we have been talking about when you just think generally about the facts that are true about you and the possibilities that you have where are those things located where are you looking to find those
POD1000000022_S0000099	those things are not hidden somewhere deep down within you that only you have access to you may have a particular perspective of the facts that are true about you and the possibilities that you have but not only do you have an incentive to slip into bad faith and tell yourself a story about them
POD1000000022_S0000100	sartre would say you do not have some privileged vip access to the facts that are true about you and the possibilities that you have i mean hypothetically any other person if they were diligent enough has access to your facticity and transcendence
POD1000000022_S0000101	in fact just like the guy that tells himself that he is napoleon sometimes other people are better at telling us who we are than we are but how is this possible the reason it is possible is because the self is not the christian soul desartre
POD1000000022_S0000102	just like your facticity and transcendence what we are referencing when we talk about ourselves is outside of us it is an abstraction it is the conglomeration of all the things you have ever actually done in your life
POD1000000022_S0000103	when you want to get a solid answer to the question who am i you do not reference the story that you tell yourself in your head that is clouded by all sorts of bad faith and wishful thinking like the guy that thinks he would try to take down the gunman at walmart
POD1000000022_S0000104	no we tell ourselves stories all the time what follows from this is that the true measure of your values the true measure of who you are is what you actually do it is the collection of what you have actually done thus far in your life and sartre says that when you stop looking at the self
POD1000000022_S0000105	as though it is this thing inside of you and you start looking at it more accurately as this abstraction that is outside of us what you inevitably start to realize is that it is impossible to ever get a full picture of who you are without referencing the way that other people view you
POD1000000022_S0000106	more than that it is impossible to ever get a full picture of being without referencing other people and here is what he is getting at so far when it comes to describing being we have been presented with being in itself and being for itself but it is right here fairly late in being
POD1000000022_S0000107	nothingness that sartre lays out his 3rd ontological category what he calls being for others let us talk about what he means sartre would say that an intrinsic part of what it is to be you is existing alongside other people and all the consequences that come along with that
POD1000000022_S0000108	this is sartre is concept of being for others now how does being for others affect my answer to the question who am i well again this concept of the self is outside of us it is an abstraction
POD1000000022_S0000109	and what sartre points out is that there are many aspects about who we are that are given to us by other people for example whether we are trustworthy or not whether or not you are a trustworthy person is an aspect of who you are that is mediated by other people right
POD1000000022_S0000110	whether i am a nice or mean person look i may think of myself as a nice person but if every single other person i encounter all throughout my life says that i mean for all intents and purposes i am a mean person this concept of the self
POD1000000022_S0000111	and how other people view us seem to be connected to sartre but the flip side of it being that interconnected is that it leaves us in what he describes as a perpetual state of being judged by the people around us
POD1000000022_S0000112	we are almost always being turned into pure facticity in other people is minds for example have you ever walked around and you are self conscious about the way you look maybe you just got a new pair of shoes and you think they look weird and as you are walking around you feel like every person that passes you is looking at you and they are thinking .
POD1000000022_S0000113	wow what were they thinking when they picked out those shoes this is obviously a person that does not care very much about the way that they look in other words they are looking at you and they are turning you into an object in their subjective view of the world pure facticity
POD1000000022_S0000114	you will henceforth be known as the weird shoes guy in that person is mind this is constantly going on but sartre is not saying it is always bad that being around other people is some paranoid everybody is thinking bad things about me all the time thing
POD1000000022_S0000115	people very well may be thinking really good things about you all the time the point that sartre wants to make is that this whole dynamic this dynamic of other people seeing you putting you on trial and turning you into pure facticity in their minds this is going on all the time
POD1000000022_S0000116	simply by virtue of the fact that we exist alongside other people and that while the insights other people give us about who we are are no doubt valuable we have to be careful not to slip into bad faith on either side of this dynamic of being for others what i mean is
POD1000000022_S0000117	just because somebody sees you wearing weird shoes one day does not mean that you are now weird shoes guy in perpetuity in other words do not slip into bad faith when it comes to what other people think about you no matter how convenient it may be to prescribe yourself an essence and deny your transcendence
POD1000000022_S0000118	do not turn yourself into pure facticity and just accept what other people tell you you are maybe you are a weird shoes guy right now but you do not have to be in the future but the other side of that is do not deny your facticity do not tell yourself your shoes are fine
POD1000000022_S0000119	do not tell yourself that you do not care what anyone else says or that what other people think does not matter to you at all obviously it does that is slipping into another kind of bad faith
POD1000000022_S0000120	so to sum this up i guess look intuitively
POD1000000022_S0000121	it may seem to us like we have a sort of special access to knowing who we are and that we choose to share ourselves with only our closest friends who we trust dearly but sartre would say that the reason it seems that way is because what you actually have is a narrative about yourself
POD1000000022_S0000123	perspective and that the reason it seems like your friends reinforce this picture of who you are
POD1000000022_S0000124	is because that is the very criteria we all use to choose who our friends are going to be is whether or not they reinforce this picture that we have of ourselves that is what we like about our friends to sartre
POD1000000022_S0000125	for example if a big part of the way that you view yourself and your identity is that you consider yourself to be a smart person sartre would predict that most of your friends are going to be people that are not so smart that tell you you are smart all the time
POD1000000022_S0000126	or people that ask you a lot of questions that you then answer making you feel smart or other smart people that commend you on being smart like them to sartre we choose our friends because they reinforce the way that we view ourselves
POD1000000022_S0000127	of course we would give them privileged access to our biased narrative of ourselves
POD1000000022_S0000128	and of course it is going to feel validating of course it would seem that you know better than anyone else who you are but again sartre would say that the true measure of your values the true answer to the question who are you
POD1000000022_S0000129	is what you actually do thank you for listening i will talk to you next time
POD1000000025_S0000000	there is sort of like a before we met and an after we met a no gradient .
POD1000000025_S0000001	yeah
POD1000000025_S0000002	like i do not
POD1000000025_S0000003	it is just like i do not even know this guy and then this is the person i work with on everything
POD1000000025_S0000004	and i am pretty sure this day and time i was like this is my best friend
POD1000000025_S0000006	i am david diggs
POD1000000025_S0000007	i am rafael casal
POD1000000025_S0000008	everybody is
POD1000000025_S0000010	it is a little hard to summarize the partnership between david and raphael because as best friends and creative collaborators they have done so much over the years together
POD1000000025_S0000011	let me start individually david diggs won a tony and a grammy for his performance in hamilton
POD1000000025_S0000012	he played thomas jefferson and the marquis de lafayette in the original broadway cast
POD1000000025_S0000013	he is also the vocalist in the experimental hip hop group clipping
POD1000000025_S0000014	rafael casal is an actor writer and director he is an award winning slam poet and started appearing on hbo is deaf poetry jam at the age of 18
POD1000000025_S0000015	over the 20 years these guys have known each other they have worked in theater poetry music and film and usually in some combination of those mediums
POD1000000025_S0000016	they co wrote and co starred in the film blindspotting which premiered at the sundance film festival in 2018
POD1000000025_S0000017	and president obama named it one of his favorite movies of the year
POD1000000025_S0000018	blindspotting takes place in oakland which is also where david and raphael are from
POD1000000025_S0000019	their story begins at berkeley high school here is tavit
POD1000000025_S0000021	i am not sure when we met or when we were formally introduced but surely at some sort of poetry event because we were both sort of coming up in that scene
POD1000000025_S0000022	and i was older 4 years older than him
POD1000000025_S0000023	my freshman year his senior year that is a lifetime apart in high school
POD1000000025_S0000024	my memory of him in high school is like diggs always had like a very national way about him
POD1000000025_S0000025	and i do not know that this paints it accurately but this is a representation of it it is like at some point diggs was like i am just wearing pajama pants to school every day
POD1000000025_S0000026	and i am sure that was not the whole time i got this little window of it
POD1000000025_S0000027	it was the whole time all of high school for sure
POD1000000025_S0000029	that is amazing
POD1000000025_S0000030	it was like as a rule but we would see each other at these poetry events and he was really really good at writing poems
POD1000000025_S0000031	like a way more sort of focused writer than i had ever been in that situation you know
POD1000000025_S0000032	so i remember that i remember thinking that here is a person that is actually better than me at this thing
POD1000000025_S0000033	and that is pretty cool
POD1000000025_S0000034	and then over the years also after when i was in college when i would come back home for the summers sometimes i would drop in just to watch like poetry things that were happening or sort of check in on the scene
POD1000000025_S0000035	and he was like the dude he had become that guy constantly
POD1000000025_S0000036	and i remember that so differently
POD1000000025_S0000038	i barely finished high school in a very non traditional way and then went off and did this show on hbo deaf poetry
POD1000000025_S0000040	this just in a skewed perspective for today is youth you all ladies aint thin enough fellas aint trim enough
POD1000000025_S0000041	want to be sexy you all do not go to the gym enough cut to commercial
POD1000000025_S0000042	came back and had just enough money saved up with some friends to open a very dungeon y recording studio and we were looking for other artists we did not have anybody else recording at the studio
POD1000000025_S0000043	and so a mutual friend of ours one of his close friends who was the older brother of one of my close friends was like you know david raps
POD1000000025_S0000044	yeah we really got set up on like a rapper play date
POD1000000025_S0000045	so our friend justin was like you guys should work together you are 2 of my favorite rappers
POD1000000025_S0000046	i was like yeah yeah and he played me stuff and it was really good
POD1000000025_S0000047	i did not have anywhere to record i was recording songs in my mom is closet in the little closet in my room
POD1000000025_S0000048	i had not been in a lot of studio spaces so i was like 0 studio
POD1000000025_S0000049	i do not know that this qualified as an actual .
POD1000000025_S0000050	i did not know that yet
POD1000000025_S0000051	because i have not been there yet
POD1000000025_S0000052	but i do not think we had any idea like what meeting each other and actually getting time was going to be like
POD1000000025_S0000053	finally we started it was like this is the song we are going to work
POD1000000025_S0000054	we had listened through some beats and it was like let us work on this one
POD1000000025_S0000055	i just started writing and yeah it happened really fast
POD1000000025_S0000056	and at some point we looked up and everyone else was gone and it was just the 2 of us in there we were still making music
POD1000000025_S0000058	we just made music until the sun came up and began the ritual that day of going to the car at 8 a m
POD1000000025_S0000059	and playing everything that you would recorded and then like dragging your body home to sleep and kind of doing it all over again
POD1000000025_S0000061	i have been making music for many many years and it had never been that much fun before
POD1000000025_S0000062	suddenly there is this person that writes a verse in 5 minutes and can nail it in a take
POD1000000025_S0000063	and at the time we were like working with some random singers and stuff that could not ever sing the line and rappers who took like an hour to get a verse down
POD1000000025_S0000064	it was just like wow this is so easy and then we will just have songs done
POD1000000025_S0000065	and what we always joke about is like there is sort of like a before we met and an after we met and no gradient
POD1000000025_S0000066	yeah
POD1000000025_S0000068	i do not even know this guy and then this is the person i work with
POD1000000025_S0000069	on everything
POD1000000025_S0000070	and i am pretty sure this day and time i was like this is my best friend
POD1000000025_S0000072	like .
POD1000000025_S0000074	as a young artist early on when i am still trying to figure things out and creating is hard for me being around somebody who just creates all the time it is addictive
POD1000000025_S0000075	i do not have the technical skillset that rafa has so like he was so fast in pro tools
POD1000000025_S0000076	so all of these things that i just i would have to labor over and then all of that stuff became really impressive too
POD1000000025_S0000077	once you know as we started working together and i became aware that he had taught himself all of these things like nobody ever really showed him how to do anything it seemed like
POD1000000025_S0000078	and he was editing videos and shooting things you know the whole range of what it takes to be a music artist like out in the world he had taught himself to do
POD1000000025_S0000079	i did not really know anybody like that
POD1000000025_S0000080	you know over the next 4 or 5 years we recorded
POD1000000025_S0000082	no one will ever hear
POD1000000025_S0000084	legit 100s
POD1000000025_S0000085	and wrote a play together and then we lived together and it was like 0 man
POD1000000025_S0000086	when we are around each other this much it is like we have too many ideas
POD1000000025_S0000087	it was like the right amount of proximity for like the full version of creativity that we had always
POD1000000025_S0000088	like we thought we had already tapped it and we like did so much shit that year
POD1000000025_S0000089	yeah
POD1000000025_S0000090	i think artistically we are doing great
POD1000000025_S0000091	yeah we were definitely making it and we were definitely broke
POD1000000025_S0000093	the thing it was like
POD1000000025_S0000094	i got on the radio
POD1000000025_S0000095	this is also great listen to how he says we at this one that is really rafa was known right
POD1000000025_S0000096	he had a song that got played on like clear channel radio and then got named like one of the bay area freshmen 10 it is like
POD1000000025_S0000097	best new whatever
POD1000000025_S0000098	he got named one of those but rafa never would take that for himself and it was always like us
POD1000000025_S0000099	we are and so like we played those shows together and like would end up making no money on these gigs
POD1000000025_S0000100	because he would bring me and a band like 4 or 5 other people to play music use the entire fee to fly us out to wherever georgia and like play a show where no one would make any money but we got to play a show
POD1000000025_S0000101	and he was like doing that from jump for so long
POD1000000025_S0000102	why was that how you would always do it
POD1000000025_S0000103	well because one i do not i am uncomfortable with i statements
POD1000000025_S0000105	berkeley is shit
POD1000000025_S0000108	i am a good ruler
POD1000000025_S0000110	they feel self indulgent
POD1000000025_S0000112	i was raised to not feed an ego that feels constantly eager for food
POD1000000025_S0000114	what i love about that period is like we were all pushing to little different degrees of success
POD1000000025_S0000115	we are just kind of weirdos like almost in a scene that we kind of make sense in
POD1000000025_S0000116	they did not understand digs very much at all i feel like the more commercial bay area scene
POD1000000025_S0000117	and they only sort of understood me like it was very like yeah you are in but like do not try to make any changes you know
POD1000000025_S0000118	and i think that is a big reason that we went to l a
POD1000000025_S0000119	we can see the top of the ladder and it is not getting any friendlier or more receptive
POD1000000025_S0000120	and we maybe could make this movie and maybe there is like different music opportunities down there but it is definitely not going to happen here
POD1000000025_S0000121	and then suddenly we like packed up from the west oakland place and moved to l a
POD1000000025_S0000122	also we had already been we were working on blindspotting and so we had been traveling up and down
POD1000000025_S0000123	our producers we had been driving to meet with them really frequently
POD1000000025_S0000124	we were slumming it so hard when we got to la we were so poor diggs was delivering tacos
POD1000000025_S0000125	yeah i was like i could not be an actor in l a is what i decided
POD1000000025_S0000126	we are just like swinging and missing
POD1000000025_S0000128	just trying to figure out what does it mean to be in the bigger pond and want to be artists professionally
POD1000000025_S0000129	and we did 5 years in la before diggs went to new york to do hamilton
POD1000000025_S0000130	i think that was one of those things that came about for diggs really organically
POD1000000025_S0000131	hamilton was such an interesting like muscle like it was a play that was like legit written for him to flex all the things he is good at
POD1000000025_S0000132	they were like who is this rap kid that turns out can also act
POD1000000025_S0000133	and the rest of us were like turns out he has been doing that more than a lot of you all you know
POD1000000025_S0000134	and the world saw diggs in the light that best showed everything and they not only accepted but obsessed over it
POD1000000025_S0000135	and then i went to visit him in new york when the show was picking up steam
POD1000000025_S0000136	and the 1st thing that happened is this girl grabs my arm and looks at diggs and goes 0 my god is that davi diggs to me
POD1000000025_S0000137	and i start to realize that this woman is anne hathaway and she is fangirling out
POD1000000025_S0000138	and i am like 0 man like a major shift is happening
POD1000000025_S0000139	my life is changing very very quickly i was under stress constantly
POD1000000025_S0000140	rafa is like calling and texting and emailing and i am like getting back to the degree that i can
POD1000000025_S0000141	and so like yes obviously it would have been like so much easier and nicer if my best friend was also living in new york and somebody who has context for me outside of this thing
POD1000000025_S0000142	and i remember i got somebody turn days and i was like i am thinking about moving to new york so you will respond more in person
POD1000000025_S0000143	and i remember diggs goes i did not want to ask
POD1000000025_S0000145	that is like a big ask and like i am doing 8 shows a week it is not like move to new york and like let us go kick it in the berkshires
POD1000000025_S0000146	you know like it was like move to new york and i will see you like at midnight sometimes
POD1000000025_S0000147	but i was like well it is just good for him to have a friend there but also like can i run your social media
POD1000000025_S0000149	because you are not posting enough and like people want to see this adventure and like there is a sincere way to do it
POD1000000025_S0000150	and i had done like a little bit of it with his twitter and stuff in the bay and in la but like this was like give me your passwords i probably already had them
POD1000000025_S0000152	it was an admission that he was going to use
POD1000000025_S0000154	and i was like yeah i would do that
POD1000000025_S0000155	and especially if you actually do not even have to do it
POD1000000025_S0000157	be self indulgent i am doing it
POD1000000025_S0000159	you know like like there is like a year of his instagram that is just his friend is version of how awesome he is
POD1000000025_S0000161	you know
POD1000000025_S0000162	blindspotting got started because around when i was 211 of my friends got killed in a way that sort of did not make a lot of sense to most people in the community
POD1000000025_S0000163	and it was sort of like the breaking point because it was a woman because it was somebody who was not really involved in the violence of the world that we were existing in at the time
POD1000000025_S0000164	some other people have been killed other people i was close to there is a series of funerals people have gone to in succession
POD1000000025_S0000165	and this was the button on it it was just like a breaking point for me
POD1000000025_S0000166	and so i would written this poem about sort of like the numbness of that experience of like god is this like what life is
POD1000000025_S0000167	like people die and we get numb and we care a little less every time like how does this go
POD1000000025_S0000168	and then we just kind of started coming up with a story that was a movie that is in verse starring the 2 of us
POD1000000025_S0000169	we kept almost making blind spotting and not making it
POD1000000025_S0000170	digs he finishes this massive sensation in new york he had like 30 days in june that he could shoot this movie
POD1000000025_S0000171	22
POD1000000025_S0000172	and then a month later we were in oakland shooting the movie
POD1000000025_S0000173	in the hometown everybody who is an extra in that movie is a friend of ours that we grew up with
POD1000000025_S0000174	and it is still not a real movie to us it is still a thing we can not believe they made
POD1000000025_S0000175	in hollywood in a world that we always assumed we did not belong in you know that we never really figured out how we would fit into anyway
POD1000000025_S0000176	to have doors start opening in a way where they are sort of asking questions about what you want to do is crazy actually
POD1000000025_S0000177	it is just fun in meetings post blindspotting now that we are associated together in this way and also people have been able to see that raphael is a great actor as well as a great writer
POD1000000025_S0000178	like where it is like well what is he doing do you think he would be interested in this
POD1000000025_S0000179	can you talk to him for us it is like pretty i love that i love that so much
POD1000000025_S0000180	and i still know the 10 things that he can do that nobody is seen yet and that is still fun for me
POD1000000025_S0000181	the closest i have ever gotten to fighting with rafa i think is like when somebody else i am close to is fighting with rafa right
POD1000000025_S0000182	i think that is sort of our good cop bad cop side of it
POD1000000025_S0000183	so i am going to be like venting to him and he is like i do not know what to tell you i have already picked my team
POD1000000025_S0000185	we have this expression that we always say we did this before every show and we kind of do it anytime we are at a crossroads we are like

POD1000000027_S0000009	from espn you are listening to 30 for 30 podcasts my name is jody avergan welcome to our 5th season of original audio documentaries as we have done before we are devoting the entire season to one story it is told over 5 parts
POD1000000027_S0000011	it is about a scandal that rocked the nba and tells us a lot about how power race and celebrity intersect in modern sports
POD1000000027_S0000013	for this season we are excited to work with espn is ramona shelburne one of our top nba reporters an la native and someone who has been covering this story from the moment it broke
POD1000000027_S0000014	ramona is your host for all 5 episodes a quick word of warning this season contains mature subject matter and language and now coming up after the break from 30 for 30 and the undefeated the sterling affairs
POD1000000027_S0000016	shelly sterling thought she was just going to return some clothes to neiman marcus when she got in her mercedes benz station wagon and made the drive from malibu to beverly hills it was early in the spring of 2014
POD1000000027_S0000017	and even though shelly was almost 80 years old she was still going into town as rich people call beverly hills 4 or 5 days a week it is hard to guess shelly is age if you do not know it
POD1000000027_S0000018	because she keeps her hair this convincing pale blonde and her face is very well maintained driving into beverly hills is basically like entering a state park for the rich and famous
POD1000000027_S0000019	there are the iconic brown and yellow signs that let you know you have entered a special place and shelley sterling and her husband donald own a ton of it
POD1000000027_S0000020	over their 60 year marriage the sterlings built a real estate empire in their heyday they were the largest residential landlords in l a county
POD1000000027_S0000022	but most people knew her husband donald sterling as the longtime owner of the los angeles clippers one of the worst owners in all of sports his team was the laughingstock of the nba for decades
POD1000000027_S0000023	for shelly it should have been would have been just a jaunt down rodeo drive to return some wildly expensive clothes but unbeknownst to her her husband was also at neiman marcus that day
POD1000000027_S0000024	with a woman 49 years his junior named vy stiviano she was not the 1st mistress not even close but vy was something different
POD1000000027_S0000026	shelley told me that story when we met in the winter of 2019 at the beverly hills plaza hotel or my hotel as she calls it
POD1000000027_S0000027	shelly was 84 at the time but she can tell that story of that run in with donald and v 5 years earlier with exacting detail
POD1000000027_S0000028	i happened to be there to return something and she was there with donald and with some other friends and we had a big confrontation she was very very very nasty and mean to me
POD1000000027_S0000029	what happened was that she ran into shelly i think at nordstrom and they started talking and i guess things got out of hand
POD1000000027_S0000030	that is v siviano is lawyer mac nehore and when i told shelley sterling his version of the story she scoffed
POD1000000027_S0000031	it was at neiman marcus
POD1000000027_S0000032	at 1st i thought it was funny that shelley took the time to correct him i mean here is a woman talking to a female reporter about her husband is infidelity who cares whether you confront your husband is mistress outside of neiman marcus or nortys
POD1000000027_S0000033	but the details matter here it is important to get it right because that meeting outside of neiman marcus that petty squabble between a wife and her husband is mistress set off a chain of events
POD1000000027_S0000034	that in the end led to one of the biggest scandals in professional sports a controversy that forced the nba to finally deal with donald sterling after decades of his bad behavior and had ripple effects throughout the entire league
POD1000000027_S0000036	this is the sterling affairs from 30 for 30 podcasts and the undefeated i am ramona shelburne
POD1000000027_S0000039	i have covered basketball in la for a long time the nba is a league of huge personalities and even bigger egos fighting for power and if you want the real score that is the game you have to follow
POD1000000027_S0000041	i learned pretty quickly that there is no other owner in basketball with quite the same personality or ego as donald sterling sterling was not a basketball guy he was a personal injury lawyer and then he got filthy rich off of real estate
POD1000000027_S0000043	that is what he was really good at
POD1000000027_S0000045	i could never understand why he even kept the clippers when his reputation as an owner was so bad but that is because i always assumed that deep down he wanted what everyone in the game is supposed to want to win
POD1000000027_S0000047	but rich people like donald sterling multi $10 rich people do not live in the same world as the rest of us do not play by the same rules when you have enough money it is like you are rubber everything just bounces off of you
POD1000000027_S0000048	even 3 decades of driving an nba franchise into the ground when you are as rich as donald and shelley you get to tell yourself that everything is fabulous
POD1000000027_S0000049	i feel fabulous
POD1000000027_S0000050	they are fabulous
POD1000000027_S0000051	fabulous
POD1000000027_S0000052	he was just so fabulous
POD1000000027_S0000053	i was born and raised in l a and i have never heard anyone use the word fabulous as much as these 2 do
POD1000000027_S0000054	they were fabulous it was just fabulous
POD1000000027_S0000055	even their court battles
POD1000000027_S0000056	i want to thank everybody who has helped me my attorneys they were fabulous
POD1000000027_S0000057	and of course anything related to the team
POD1000000027_S0000058	and the us team that won it all the fabulous american team we are fabulous let us give a hand to america usa
POD1000000027_S0000060	and donald sterling is life was fabulous why would he think otherwise nobody ever questioned him to his face anyway he did whatever he wanted he said whatever he wanted he had relationships with whomever he wanted
POD1000000027_S0000062	i did not know v stiviano back then and yes that is her real name v just the letter v with a period she was born maria vanessa perez
POD1000000027_S0000063	but changed her name to v stiviano at about the same time she would met donald at a super bowl party in 2010 before that she had been trying desperately to climb out of the poverty that she would grown up in
POD1000000027_S0000064	she had been running a food truck business and trying to work her way onto reality tv shows and cozying up to whomever was the most relevant powerful or famous then she met donald
POD1000000027_S0000066	there is an unwritten contract between young women and their very rich but much older sugar daddies that helps each side pretend it is about love and not sex for money never talk about age pretend looks do not matter
POD1000000027_S0000067	money in her maze bags are gifts and never ever humiliate the wife but vistaviano either did not know or did not care because she broke every last rule in the mistress terms and agreements
POD1000000027_S0000068	she went right at shelly
POD1000000027_S0000069	she said to the people in the office i am going to own the office one day and she said to the clipper people she says this is going to be my team one day i mean just bold really bold
POD1000000027_S0000070	and it all got back to me you know
POD1000000027_S0000071	she kept telling people she was going to be the next missus sterling
POD1000000027_S0000072	katherine bauman is one of shelley is best friends and a longtime clippers fan
POD1000000027_S0000073	she would stalk shelly she would watch where shelly would go and then she would show up and i do remember at the one time she went into the restroom where shelly was just paraded around showed off herself then shelly walked out
POD1000000027_S0000074	at clippers games the entire extended sterling universe was usually there and usually just feet from one another sometimes shelly and donald sat in their court side seats together and v sat in her seats directly across the court
POD1000000027_S0000075	other nights v would sit next to donald and shelly was nowhere to be seen clipper players like ryan hollins and matt barnes got used to v being around you could not not notice her
POD1000000027_S0000076	she would just parade around the arena and it is like it was so awkward like we kind of know what is going on but you are doing it in front of our faces as if we are silly and so it was an odd odd situation
POD1000000027_S0000077	nobody liked her we knew why she was here and we all thought it was crazy to begin with but you know it was not our place to speak on it at the time
POD1000000027_S0000078	clipper is employees often got caught in the middle of this bizarre triangle shelley would call team president andy roser demanding that v not be allowed in the building and then donald would call roser and ask him to leave 4 tickets for her
POD1000000027_S0000079	these were relationships begging to implode but none of the entangled ever tried to solve the problem donald shelly v each kept pushing each other waiting for someone to break
POD1000000027_S0000080	well the breaking started on christmas day 2012 v called the sterling house asking to speak to donald
POD1000000027_S0000081	we were all sitting down christmas day having dinner and she called
POD1000000027_S0000082	shelly was mortified the family was sitting at the dinner table waiting for donald as he is pacing on the tennis courts outside fighting with his mistress
POD1000000027_S0000083	i do not know they had some argument and the family heard about it you know it just it was not a good scene
POD1000000027_S0000085	the fight with shelly started when he hung up
POD1000000027_S0000086	not that that was uncommon even without v they fought often but this was escalating shelly and donald is youngest son scott had to step in before it got physical he confronted his father and demanded he stop this nonsense with v
POD1000000027_S0000087	and stop disrespecting his mother like this
POD1000000027_S0000089	it was a big moment but nothing came of it
POD1000000027_S0000091	a week later scott died
POD1000000027_S0000093	it was 1st reported to be a pulmonary embolism but later revealed to be an overdose he was 32
POD1000000027_S0000095	and i do not think people realize this but you lost a child
POD1000000027_S0000096	i know
POD1000000027_S0000097	right around then
POD1000000027_S0000098	january 1st
POD1000000027_S0000100	shelly was devastated
POD1000000027_S0000101	i was going through the motions of living
POD1000000027_S0000103	it was not just that the fight with v was the last volatile moment between donald and scott
POD1000000027_S0000105	when scott died donald stayed with vee instead of going home to his wife as she grieved it was too much she kicked don out of the house
POD1000000027_S0000107	shelly needed breathing room and i think don had pushed the envelope a little too far
POD1000000027_S0000108	i really thought that we probably were going to be getting a divorce
POD1000000027_S0000110	but shelly and donald had been together too long been through too much together had too much of their lives and their money intertwined
POD1000000027_S0000112	they did not divorce the situation simply continued to deteriorate over the next year as donald spent more and more time with vee
POD1000000027_S0000114	plus shelley was starting to learn about the gifts v posted pictures on instagram v driving the $240000 red ferrari that donald had bought her
POD1000000027_S0000115	and the range rover and the 2 bentleys shelley also found out that donald had bought v a $180 duplex
POD1000000027_S0000116	when i found out that he had paid for all the cars and he paid for this house i was furious
POD1000000027_S0000117	it was that anger that shelly brought to neiman marcus with her returns on the fateful day that she encountered donald and v it was not the 1st time the 2 women had run into each other or argued but this time shelly decided she would had enough
POD1000000027_S0000118	and that is when i decided i was going to sue her
POD1000000027_S0000119	on march 7 2014 shelley sterling filed a lawsuit in california superior court against vistiviano seeking the return of all those gifts from donald
POD1000000027_S0000121	donald and shelley sterling were worth multiple 10s of dollars and had done what the ultra rich do put all their money and property into a joint trust
POD1000000027_S0000122	every dime that the sterling spent cost each of them a nickel therefore shelley argued the money that donald used to pay for the gifts was just as much hers as it was his
POD1000000027_S0000123	so she turned to the courts that sounds a little extreme well you do not know the sterlings calling a lawyer is how they get out of bed in the morning
POD1000000027_S0000124	to say they are litigious is like saying there is traffic on the 405 and besides suing to get what they want had proven incredibly effective for the sterlings over the years
POD1000000027_S0000125	most people did not have the means or the stomach to battle them in court they would settle before they starved
POD1000000027_S0000126	she kept saying to donald you better have her drop the lawsuit and he would say 0 she will not really go through with it but she is just doing it for a fact and she says well she better drop the lawsuit
POD1000000027_S0000127	but here is how the lawsuit the courtroom product of a bedroom dispute really came to change everything for some time now v had been recording her conversations with donald
POD1000000027_S0000128	sweetie i am sorry
POD1000000027_S0000129	i am so sorry jim we made a giant mistake hopeless
POD1000000027_S0000130	and according to v and her lawyer donald was aware she was making the tapes
POD1000000027_S0000132	he had been forgetting things he said to her and the tapes were a way of reminding him
POD1000000027_S0000134	please please please please
POD1000000027_S0000135	she would recorded 100s of conversations over the past 2 years a lot of the recordings were mundane boring even but some of the recordings were arguments and capture decided donald that he would never want his wife or anyone else to hear
POD1000000027_S0000136	i guess that you do not know that maybe you are stupid
POD1000000027_S0000137	no matter what the original intent of those tapes was they became something v could use as blackmail because v stiviano had no intention of returning those gifts from donald
POD1000000027_S0000138	she wanted me to drop the lawsuit
POD1000000027_S0000139	v says to donald i want that bitch wife of yours lawsuit dismissed
POD1000000027_S0000140	pierce 0 donnell is shelley sterling is lawyer
POD1000000027_S0000141	and he tried to get shelly dismissed and she would not do it
POD1000000027_S0000142	if donald could not or would not fix the situation v decided she would take matters into her own hands it was time to use the tapes
POD1000000027_S0000143	to reveal donald sterling for who he really was

POD1000000027_S0000161	on april 9 2014 a clippers executive assistant texted v on behalf of donald
POD1000000027_S0000162	the text was to make sure that bea understood she was not welcome at the game against the oklahoma city thunder later that evening that her tickets her vip pass and her parking had been revoked
POD1000000027_S0000163	v responded with a series of escalating texts saying she was going to the game anyway and then some veiled threats
POD1000000027_S0000164	i would hate for staples center to get involved in what is going on
POD1000000027_S0000165	3 hours later she got a response
POD1000000027_S0000166	mister sterling said to let me know if you need anything we do not want to have any issues at the game
POD1000000027_S0000167	the header opening
POD1000000027_S0000168	no you tell mister sterling that i do not need anything nor do i want anything but thanks for asking let the games begin
POD1000000027_S0000170	attached to the text was an audio file and when the clippers employee opened the file she heard this
POD1000000027_S0000171	and you are lousy f ing instagrams you do not have to have yourself with walking with black people
POD1000000027_S0000172	and it bothers you
POD1000000027_S0000173	yeah it bothers me a lot that you want to broadcast that you are associating with black people do you have to
POD1000000027_S0000174	you are still here with black people
POD1000000027_S0000175	i am not you and you are not me you are supposed to be a delicate white or a delicate latino girl
POD1000000027_S0000176	i am a mixed girl
POD1000000027_S0000178	it was shocking the clippers assistant immediately emailed the file to clippers president andy roser and that is how shelly learned about the tape too
POD1000000027_S0000179	i did not even know that the tape was sent to the clippers until somebody at a game told me that they said they received a tape from her
POD1000000027_S0000180	and i said well what is the tape about so i said to andy andy rose i said andy what are you doing about this and he says 0 well she will never do anything
POD1000000027_S0000181	roser had worked for donald sterling for nearly 3 decades he did what everybody learns to do after a while stay out of the really ugly stuff
POD1000000027_S0000182	donald and shelley had cleaned up their own messes for 6 decades he figured they would eventually make this one go away too but they did not shelley told her lawyers about the tapes
POD1000000027_S0000183	and they in turn went to v is lawyer and demanded to hear them and that is when v is tiviano made her big move
POD1000000027_S0000185	i got a call by a trusted confidential source who said you have to hear this
POD1000000027_S0000186	mike walters was the news director at tmz at the time now he runs his own celebrity news site the blast
POD1000000027_S0000187	the 1st thing i did was say who is donald sterling i had heard the name i knew that donald sterling was important but i had no idea that he owned the clippers
POD1000000027_S0000188	even for someone from tmz whose job was breaking the internet with the juiciest most controversial stories this felt like something different
POD1000000027_S0000190	i received the audio and said 0 my god
POD1000000027_S0000193	it was the most repulsive disgusting
POD1000000027_S0000195	unbelievable
POD1000000027_S0000197	audio or moment that i would ever heard in my lifetime come out of somebody is mouth that then once i realized who they were how much impact that may have
POD1000000027_S0000199	but no one in the clippers world seemed to realize
POD1000000027_S0000201	the fact is shelley and several people in the clippers organization heard the recording and decided not to act on it or were not appalled enough to act on it maybe they did not understand how big a splash this tape could make
POD1000000027_S0000203	i think this deals with very touchy subjects like racism sexism
POD1000000027_S0000205	things that touch everyone in this country so i knew with all of that combined with the fact that it actually was on tape
POD1000000027_S0000207	and if i could do my job properly everyone was going to hear it that this would be a gigantic thing
POD1000000027_S0000209	so mike walters called up the nba their new commissioner adam silver had barely been in office for 3 months
POD1000000027_S0000210	i actually had never heard of adam silver until that day
POD1000000027_S0000212	turns out not even tmz was going to release something like this without some due diligence
POD1000000027_S0000214	there is a balance between privacy of people and the public is interest in what is said in this audio and i think everyone will agree with me when i say this
POD1000000027_S0000215	this had to be heard period
POD1000000027_S0000217	after calling the league tmz called the clippers to let them know they were about to publish a tape that would be very damaging to donald sterling
POD1000000027_S0000218	if you are donald sterling there is never a good time to have your girlfriend out you as a racist if you are the clippers this could not have happened at a worse moment donald sterling is clippers have been a laughingstock for decades
POD1000000027_S0000220	i mean because honestly like these clippers jokes are something we they are not even jokes they are statements of fact
POD1000000027_S0000222	in the 30 some odd years he would owned the team they would only made the playoffs 6 times they would never even moved past the semifinals that had all started to change in the late 2000s though the team had drafted a star blake griffin
POD1000000027_S0000223	nba rookie of the year blake griffin
POD1000000027_S0000225	and then ended up with another star chris paul
POD1000000027_S0000226	los angeles is electric with the addition of chris paul to the clippers
POD1000000027_S0000227	had you heard of the clippers before this
POD1000000027_S0000228	after a trade saga that rocked the nba and somehow ended up in favor of the perennial loser clippers over the nba is golden child the los angeles lakers
POD1000000027_S0000230	the buzz in los angeles has instantly shifted to the clippers
POD1000000027_S0000231	in time for this season the clippers had also managed to get themselves one of the best coaches in the nba doc rivers
POD1000000027_S0000232	it is doc rivers to the clippers 3 years $210
POD1000000027_S0000233	there was a hope of stability balance even winning
POD1000000027_S0000235	2012 saw one playoff run 2013 saw another and 2014 was going to be the year where they might finally contend for a championship
POD1000000027_S0000236	i am excited to bring a championship here to la in a clippers uniform
POD1000000027_S0000237	but now the cooper curse was about to rear its head again
POD1000000027_S0000238	the one thing i can always rely on is that the clippers screw things up
POD1000000027_S0000240	once the clippers staff found out tmz was going to publish the tape andy roser went to coach doc rivers he needed him to talk to the team before the story broke
POD1000000027_S0000241	andy i remember coming in my office one day and said hey there is a tape that tmz has that is going to come out it is not that flattering but it is not a big deal honestly i thought it was a sex tape because of donald sterling i really did
POD1000000027_S0000242	so doc did as he was told and gathered the players and warned them that something was coming superstar clippers forward blake griffin and center ryan hollins were in that room
POD1000000027_S0000243	doc gathered us
POD1000000027_S0000244	doc said hey guys we need to meet and talk
POD1000000027_S0000245	and this is about to come out
POD1000000027_S0000246	we do not know what the heck this is going to turn into
POD1000000027_S0000247	people are going to run with this none of us realized the extent because we did not hear the recording or whatever it was
POD1000000027_S0000248	he tells us to kind of prepare yourself because we are playing golden state and the focus at hand is win the games
POD1000000027_S0000249	so i think we were all kind of like all right well this is another thing we will get ready for this game
POD1000000027_S0000251	all right welcome back to sportscenter where we have some breaking news a disturbing story including the owner of one of the nba is playoff teams
POD1000000027_S0000252	tmz dropped this story at 10 p m pacific time on a friday night april 25 2014
POD1000000027_S0000253	there is an audio recording purportedly of los angeles clippers owner donald sterling making racist remarks to his girlfriend as being investigated by the national basketball association
POD1000000027_S0000254	why should you be walking properly with black people
POD1000000027_S0000255	does it matter if they are white or blue or yellow
POD1000000027_S0000256	i guess that you do not know that maybe you are stupid
POD1000000027_S0000258	i was covering the nba playoffs for espn when this scandal broke like literally i was courtside at a game in portland and i get this frantic phone call from our news desk
POD1000000027_S0000259	telling me i had to listen to this tape
POD1000000027_S0000261	people call you and tell you that i have black people on my instagram and it bothers you
POD1000000027_S0000262	yeah it bothers me a lot that you want to broadcast what you are associating with black people do you have to
POD1000000027_S0000264	suddenly the playoff game between the trail blazers and the houston rockets taking place in front of me seemed completely insignificant
POD1000000027_S0000266	i filed my game story and tried to start wrapping my head around this one
POD1000000027_S0000268	like tmz is mike walters as soon as i heard that tape i knew this was going to be huge
POD1000000027_S0000269	the disgraced clippers owner in the spotlight
POD1000000027_S0000270	sterling has a long history of questionable behavior
POD1000000027_S0000272	it is obviously appalling it is very disturbing but to be quite honest with you i was not too surprised
POD1000000027_S0000273	within hours the audio of donald sterling making racist remarks to v stiviano had gone viral
POD1000000027_S0000275	tmz is cameramen and reporters swarmed the lobby of the clippers team hotel they had booked several rooms at the 4 seasons in advance so they could legally be inside the private property
POD1000000027_S0000276	outside the hotel was even more chaotic the whole world wanted a reaction clippers team security advised players and staffers to stay inside their hotel rooms as much as possible they were on lockdown
POD1000000027_S0000277	when it came out i remember it just being chaos just from then on it was just that is all anybody was talking about
POD1000000027_S0000278	by morning lebron james the biggest star in the league was saying there is no room for a person like donald sterling in the nba
POD1000000027_S0000280	and across the country adam silver was facing his 1st real crisis
POD1000000027_S0000281	nba commissioner adam silver sitting down in memphis addressing the comments made by donald sterling
POD1000000027_S0000282	the audio recording posted by tmz is truly offensive and disturbing and we intend to get to the bottom of it as quickly as possible
POD1000000027_S0000283	silver launched an investigation within hours
POD1000000027_S0000284	i am not yet prepared to discuss any potential sanctions against donald sterling we will however move extraordinarily quickly in our investigation
POD1000000027_S0000286	if it was sterling on those tapes if they had not been doctored or altered silver knew he wanted to punish him severely the league was outraged
POD1000000027_S0000287	because on top of donald sterling saying all those unforgivably racist things sterling was also taking shots at one of the most beloved figures in all of basketball magic johnson
POD1000000027_S0000289	it was as shocking and as bizarre as anything on the tape that a picture of v stiviano and magic johnson had set him off to hear donald sterling talk that way about magic
POD1000000027_S0000290	the guy who turned the lakers into a dynasty who would fought off hiv that is the guy donald sterling told his mistress was not welcome at his games
POD1000000027_S0000291	plain and simple when you heard those comments magic what was your reaction
POD1000000027_S0000292	i was really upset you know you can not understand how hurt i was he should not own a team anymore especially when you have african americans renting his apartments coming to the games
POD1000000027_S0000293	and playing for him and coaching for him this is bad for everybody it is bad for america and so i am really upset about it
POD1000000027_S0000294	even the famously apolitical michael jordan voiced his outrage
POD1000000027_S0000295	michael jordan weighed in there is no room in the nba or anywhere else for the kind of racism and hatred that mister sterling allegedly expressed we cannot tolerate must not tolerate discrimination at any level
POD1000000027_S0000296	but the story was bigger than the nba it revealed something raw and ugly it triggered 10s of people
POD1000000027_S0000298	it is like what one of the paparazzi who was tailing donald and shelley told me it had all the elements sex money sports politics greed racism
POD1000000027_S0000299	it had everything it even had the visor you remember the visor that daft punk welding mask meets florida grandma visor that beastiviana wore anytime she stepped outside of her house
POD1000000027_S0000300	but still saying nothing is vista viano not late this afternoon when she arrived home or when she left tonight wearing different clothes but color coordinated face shields
POD1000000027_S0000301	the woman who set this whole thing off was out there rollerblading for the paparazzi
POD1000000027_S0000302	have you talked to mister sterling can you explain the mask
POD1000000027_S0000303	this was a full on media circus
POD1000000027_S0000304	why are you wearing the shield why are you holding a microphone
POD1000000027_S0000305	i do not know it is my job well then it is my job
POD1000000027_S0000306	by the end of the weekend the 1st black president of the united states was answering questions about sterling
POD1000000027_S0000308	i suspect that the nba is going to be deeply concerned in resolving this you know we the united states continues to wrestle with a legacy of race
POD1000000027_S0000309	the tapes dominated the news cycle not just because they were juicy but because donald sterling was articulating something deeper more shameful
POD1000000027_S0000311	a plantation mentality that is at the heart of a lot of this country is history
POD1000000027_S0000313	that is an nba owner a man worth 10s of dollars going on for more than 9 minutes spewing the most vile of racist thoughts a white owner whose 20 man roster was stacked with a majority of african american players
POD1000000027_S0000314	including ryan holland
POD1000000027_S0000315	those words hurt when you hear i do not want people like that well the people like that play for you the people like that buy your tickets the people like that bleed just like you bruh
POD1000000027_S0000317	earthquakes both real and metaphorical happen suddenly but they are anything but sudden the tremor is a product of tensions that build up for years until the fault lines simply break
POD1000000027_S0000318	los angeles sits on 2 fault lines san andreas and race all of us know it we live with it donald sterling was another
POD1000000027_S0000319	anyone who played for him or worked for him or covered him in the press or lived in one of his 100s of apartments on the one hand knew that it was all a matter of time until he blew up the underlying issues with sterling were well known and well documented
POD1000000027_S0000320	but like most insanely wealthy white men in america donald had managed to wiggle bully and fight his way out of all of them he knew how to play his leverage and power to outlast his adversaries and win if you can call it that
POD1000000027_S0000321	but this time felt different
POD1000000027_S0000323	i remember i had said this is really bad really bad and i knew something was going to happen i did not know what it was like shock
POD1000000027_S0000325	that is what we all were shocked but we should not have been surprised
POD1000000029_S0000001	facebook is had 15 months of quote fresh hell but 210 still use it or instagram or whatsapp or messenger every day
POD1000000029_S0000002	from american public media this is marketplace tech demystifying the digital economy i am jack stewart in for molly wood
POD1000000029_S0000004	despite the privacy scandals the federal investigations and the accusations of destroying democracy this week facebook reported its advertising revenue and global users are growing
POD1000000029_S0000005	in this week is quality assurance we take a deep dive into why in its early years facebook prioritized growth over everything else
POD1000000029_S0000006	nearly every crisis facebook now faces stems from that nicholas thompson editor in chief of wired says that is left management to navigate a metaphorical minefield
POD1000000029_S0000007	there was a lot of unexploded ordnance that they were inevitably going to step on at some point
POD1000000029_S0000008	he is an author on the magazine is latest cover story which goes behind the scenes at the troubled company he says facebook is business is actually solid for a couple of reasons
POD1000000029_S0000009	number one the advertising business model they came up with is one of the greatest ever and it does not require lots of changes they just built an amazing business model and the marginal costs of bringing in new advertisers are very low
POD1000000029_S0000010	secondly one of the smartest business decisions that mark zuckerberg ever made was to buy instagram and people do not really understand that instagram is owned by facebook or if they distrust facebook they do not distrust instagram so instagram continues to grow
POD1000000029_S0000011	so they make lots of money off of core facebook they have lots of user growth on instagram and whatsapp and the business is doing great
POD1000000029_S0000012	you would think at some point that maybe advertisers would start to push back i mean if facebook is reputation has really taken this really huge dent that it appears it has why do people still want to advertise with it
POD1000000029_S0000013	well because the advertising continues to work if at some point people have an icky feeling when they use facebook and therefore the ads are less effective then advertisers will leave
POD1000000029_S0000014	but at this moment facebook allows you to very specifically target specific users in ways that you cannot on other platforms and for lots of advertisers that is just a deal that is too good to pass up
POD1000000029_S0000015	now facebook is anticipating what it says up to a $50 fine from the federal trade commission we heard that from it this week about how it is handled some of these privacy issues
POD1000000029_S0000016	will they even feel that is the question they have so much cash on hand is it a big deal
POD1000000029_S0000017	no so facebook put out in their earnings call they said that they anticipate a $3 to $50 fine i do not know whether that is because those are the numbers the ftc has been talking about with them or if facebook is just trying to set expectations as a negotiating tactic
POD1000000029_S0000018	i would not rule out the possibility that facebook is hit with a $10 fine or a $20 fine regardless to your question even if it is at the higher end whether it is 5 or 10 or 20 it is tiny
POD1000000029_S0000019	their market cap is up i believe $40 as we talked this morning so it is not a huge hit to them obviously they would rather have $50 than not have $50 but they will be fine regardless of what this number comes out at
POD1000000029_S0000020	the thing they really worry about is antitrust if there is antitrust regulation and it comes down hard on them that is a serious problem and that would make the market drop dramatically
POD1000000029_S0000021	what are the stakes for facebook is leadership around all of these scandals the fake news the offensive content the privacy you know you detail that they have got something like 30000 moderators now does that mean they are actually taking this seriously as a business risk
POD1000000029_S0000022	yes absolutely facebook is taking it very seriously as a business risk so there are 2 really interesting questions in there so number one is do they take this seriously as a business risk absolutely are they committed to trying to counter fake news and all of the manipulation on the platform
POD1000000029_S0000023	absolutely what are the stakes to their business they are very high if the scandal continues to multiply there could be real consequences down the road what are the stakes specifically to top management meaning mark zuckerberg and sheryl sandberg the 2 people who we most associate with the company
POD1000000029_S0000024	for zuckerberg he is going to run the company as long as he wants to he has voting control of the shares he is appointed his friends as board members he is in a good position
POD1000000029_S0000025	whenever he wants to go and run the chan zuckerberg initiative or just go be an intellectual thought leader or do bill gates type things he will go choose to do that for sandberg it is tougher
POD1000000029_S0000026	and there were moments in the last year where it seemed like she might be sacrificed or where she might be in big trouble zuckerberg has expressed his loyalty to her
POD1000000029_S0000027	but as the scandals multiplied and as they started to touch her in a way they never had before it seemed as though her position was at risk and it is also certainly the case that the public reputation of both of them has dropped
POD1000000029_S0000028	a year ago we were talking about each of them as potential presidential candidates now there is not a chance
POD1000000029_S0000029	what about the morale in the wider company in the wake of all of this do you get the feeling from the people you have been talking to in your reporting that employees are fairly satisfied there i am laughing even as i say that or is there a whole lot of internal chaos at this company
POD1000000029_S0000030	there is a lot more employee dissatisfaction than there was 2 years ago
POD1000000029_S0000031	ago there are lots of employees who i talked to there who say 0 this place is great it is cool you know the media hates us but that is not my problem i am happy and there are a bunch of other people who say you know we deserve a lot of the hatred we made a lot of mistakes
POD1000000029_S0000032	we trampled on people is privacies and i regret all that we have done i talked to a lot of people who are thinking about going to work there and it does not have the halo that it did 2 years ago
POD1000000029_S0000033	they still pay you well the fact that the stock continues to go up is great particularly for people who have options
POD1000000029_S0000034	but it is a less exciting place to work and that is one of the true risks for the company and one of the most adverse effects of the last 2 years for facebook
POD1000000029_S0000035	did any part in this reporting particularly given how much time you have spent on facebook directly now did anything really surprise you
POD1000000029_S0000036	there was one specific story that stunned me and that was the circumstances that led to the departure of the 2 founders of instagram kevin systrom and mike krieger
POD1000000029_S0000037	and when fred vogelstein and i started reporting the story we made a list of the mysteries we wanted to solve that was at the very top why had they left it seems strange they had left all of a sudden in september
POD1000000029_S0000038	no one knew why and late in the reporting you know months into reporting the story we finally learned the full story and that is that according to people close to them they had grown frustrated with zuckerberg is increased meddling
POD1000000029_S0000039	they did not like the idea that instagram was going to be further merged with whatsapp and with facebook and there was real tension over instagram is growth
POD1000000029_S0000040	and there is a sense among some people at facebook that instagram is growth was coming at the expense of core facebook and that led to all kinds of tensions and then a big fight at the end of july and a moment where mark zuckerberg
POD1000000029_S0000041	according to people observing all of this mark zuckerberg asked one of his deputies to drop a list of all the ways that facebook supported instagram the way it drove users towards instagram
POD1000000029_S0000042	and then he gave the list to kevin systrom and said we are getting rid of all of these and according to people familiar with the story systrom reacted quite badly to that and then went on paternity leave came back and said i am done here
POD1000000029_S0000043	and so the biggest surprise to us was that the departure of sister mcgregor which had not come out before was much tenser much tenser than i had believed when i began reporting this story
POD1000000029_S0000044	nick thompson editor in chief of wired for context a $50 fine would be a record tech penalty in the us beating the $220 that google had to pay in 2012
POD1000000029_S0000046	and now for some related links the new york times has a good explainer on why both facebook and the ftc would be happy with a chunky fine one ends up looking strong the other looks accountable but really nothing much changes
POD1000000029_S0000047	european regulators have been tougher on tech companies google facebook and twitter all have to do more to tackle fake news to satisfy them and they want to see progress ahead of eu elections next month that is according to reuters
POD1000000029_S0000048	and even canada is getting in on the action according to the cbc this week privacy regulators there say facebook broke several laws over unauthorized data access they plan to take the company to court
POD1000000029_S0000049	if you enjoyed mark zuckerberg is testimony in front of congress here in the us with his zinging comebacks like senator we run ads then maybe you will enjoy hearing more directly from mister zuckerberg himself
POD1000000029_S0000050	i mean facebook was accused of not being open enough i am not really sure how deep into the heads of tech entrepreneurs you really want to get but zuck does have a podcast now i am not suggesting you listen i am just giving you this information
POD1000000029_S0000051	it is called tech and society with mark zuckerberg just yeah do not at me matt purdy produced this week is marketplace tech along with stephanie hughes and yves trot is our senior producer
POD1000000029_S0000053	i am jack stewart for now that is marketplace tech
POD1000000029_S0000055	this is apm
POD1000000033_S0000001	if you want to get broadband access to every state you got to know the local laws from american public media this is marketplace tech demystifying the digital economy i am molly wood
POD1000000033_S0000003	the digital economy as we like to call it over here depends pretty heavily on access to the internet and that is still not a solved problem here in the united states
POD1000000033_S0000004	over 30% of americans do not have access to broadband internet which is defined as 25 megabits per 2nd or higher that is according to research released tuesday by the npd group
POD1000000033_S0000005	the pew charitable trusts has an initiative dedicated to figuring out why this is the case today the organization is broadband research initiative is launching a new tool that lets anyone browse through broadband policies and funding in any state in the u s
POD1000000033_S0000006	it sorts the information in categories like funding competition and regulation infrastructure access and broadband definitions
POD1000000033_S0000007	like in alabama for example broadband speed is defined as only 10 megabits per 2nd if your network is busy that is barely fast enough to stream netflix in high def
POD1000000033_S0000008	katherine dewitt manages the broadband research initiative for pew charitable trusts she told me state policy is a huge deal when it comes to expanding broadband access
POD1000000033_S0000009	state policy matters because lack of access to broadband is a national issue but it is felt at the local level and states have taken a pretty aggressive approach to closing gaps in access particularly over the last 5 years
POD1000000033_S0000010	we have seen a significant uptick in legislation since 2015 and what we can take away from this is not only do state policymakers see and feel that immediate urgency of lack of broadband access
POD1000000033_S0000011	they are saying it is important to things like education healthcare and economic development but they are also saying this is what we want our state to look like they are setting goals and then they are laying out a path and a framework for how to achieve those goals
POD1000000033_S0000012	let us just dive into some of what is in the tool some of the different approaches that states are taking like could you give me an example of 2 totally different approaches that states might have taken
POD1000000033_S0000013	so going into this research we knew that states face similar challenges in increasing access to broadband but we learned that they are also taking similar approaches but adapting them to their needs that is really where those categories came from those groupings
POD1000000033_S0000014	if you look at goals for example you have states like minnesota and west virginia where their statewide broadband goals are focused on border to border universal coverage
POD1000000033_S0000015	then you look at a state like california that has a goal to connect 98% of the population in each one of its roughly 20 regions
POD1000000033_S0000016	how do you hope that a tool like this can help close the digital divide in terms of broadband access
POD1000000033_S0000017	well this tool is actually the 1st step in our ongoing research on how states are addressing gaps in broadband access so for us this was about understanding that 50 state landscape of broadband deployment laws
POD1000000033_S0000018	and it provides the basis for our next level of research which is a deeper examination of how states are addressing those gaps in access
POD1000000033_S0000019	what we hope though is that users will be able to use this tool to learn what other states are doing and how they are actually doing it
POD1000000033_S0000020	katherine dewitt manages the broadband research initiative for the pew charitable trusts we have got a link to that new tool and some analysis about spending per state at our website marketplacetech org
POD1000000033_S0000022	and now for some related links so this tool is super new obviously and pew hopes that policymakers and local governments will jump in and start creating some more analysis and comparison and of course they will be publishing their own pieces
POD1000000033_S0000023	the 1st one that i mentioned there is about how states fund their broadband projects whether it is grants or loans or general fund kind of things or some creative funding
POD1000000033_S0000024	apparently illinois makes internet service providers pay into a special coffer called the digital divide elimination fund and it uses that to pay for broadband build outs
POD1000000033_S0000025	and in virginia a legal settlement with tobacco producers is paying to build more internet
POD1000000033_S0000026	look i am not saying this is not a little wonky over here but it is interesting also i got to be honest i am still hung up on that 10 megabits per 2nd in alabama and probably some other states too i have not made it through the entire tool yet
POD1000000033_S0000027	but alabama is regulation also says isps can call their upload speeds broadband at one megabit per 2nd so basically if you are at home trying to upload some photos to facebook or anything to the cloud ever
POD1000000033_S0000028	you would be doing that at speeds 10 times slower than the slowest 4 g cell phone connection set it and forget it because it is going to take all night
POD1000000033_S0000029	now this speed question is so controversial that even though pew is using the 25 megabit per 2nd speed guideline which is set by the federal communications commission network congestion usually means actual speeds are nowhere near that fast
POD1000000033_S0000030	and again a 4 g phone connection is faster than that on the best providers
POD1000000033_S0000031	it is such a big discrepancy that while pew says 210 americans do not have broadband microsoft put out its own map of high speed internet access back in april
POD1000000033_S0000032	it said the real number of people without appropriately fast internet access for today is economy is more like 1630 in the united states alone
POD1000000033_S0000034	i am molly wood and that is marketplace tech
POD1000000033_S0000036	this is apm
POD1000000038_S0000001	let us take a break from real life for a moment to visit the somewhat near future on tv
POD1000000038_S0000002	although i have to warn you that is kinda dark too
POD1000000038_S0000003	from american public media this is marketplace tech demystifying the digital economy i am molly wood
POD1000000038_S0000005	the bbc hbo show years and years combines the politics economy and tech of 2019 and imagines how it all might evolve over the next 15 years
POD1000000038_S0000006	emma thompson is in it as a celebrity british politician with autocratic leanings but mainly the show follows a family as they deal with the world changing around them
POD1000000038_S0000007	russell t davis created and wrote years and years he is also worked on the shows doctor who torchwood and created queer as folk
POD1000000038_S0000008	he said the tech in years and years is like life it is complicated
POD1000000038_S0000010	show good and bad i think some of the saddest moments you have a world war being announced on television and the little 56 year old kids just sit staring into their phones playing their games
POD1000000038_S0000011	so yes there is bad stuff but that is very easy to talk about and yet there is very very good stuff i tell you actually when i made the choice to center this around a family
POD1000000038_S0000012	that came from one of the good sides of current tech which is very simply the whatsapp group i am one of 3 kids there is 2 sisters they have got 2 kids each we are a nice family we all like each other we get on
POD1000000038_S0000013	but up until a couple of years ago my nieces had grown up 23 years ago i would have texted them twice a year happy birthday and merry christmas now 0 my god i went out the other night and i came back to the whatsapp group to 53 messages
POD1000000038_S0000015	because someone had cooked a lasagna with butternut squash so yes there is good stuff if you choose either good or either bad you are not a very good writer you have got to get both in there because in the end it is not the technology it is the people
POD1000000038_S0000016	well it is great because some of the tech feels really immediate like a headband that projects a holographic sort of snapchat filter for your face that everyone can see in the physical world it is futuristic but it is also completely realistic
POD1000000038_S0000017	yes yes i think if that was invented tomorrow we would all go and buy one i mean i find those filters fascinating
POD1000000038_S0000019	sends each other is photos of themselves looking like a dog
POD1000000038_S0000021	rash of instagram filters like what dog are you or what cake are you i am certainly a battenberg but i love those filters and i am fascinated by the way we love those filters
POD1000000038_S0000022	and so the moment someone invents a filter you can see in the real world not just on your phone 0 my god i would be phoning you from my palace on the moon
POD1000000038_S0000023	do you have conflicting feelings about tech or is it like so many things where it just reflects the real world
POD1000000038_S0000024	yeah it is interesting that i think it is both i think i think you have to be entertaining but entertain does not mean being glib or daft i think i am getting older i think my stuff is full of warnings now to be honest it is funny i am now in the middle of an edit of my next drama
POD1000000038_S0000026	hbo max over there which is about the aids crisis of the 1980s
POD1000000038_S0000028	i have just watched an edit of an episode warning about viruses and we step out of our front doors and there is a virus on the loose you can not learn those lessons from history enough it is strange is not it what a world
POD1000000038_S0000029	i was telling people that i am taking a little bit of comfort in a darker timeline but there is something comforting about the passage of time right like you fast forward in these episodes and increasingly terrible things happen but also
POD1000000038_S0000030	people are still living their normal lives talk to me about that sense of perspective
POD1000000038_S0000031	yes that is right i mean it was quite a hard show to sell initially with its concept of moving forward in time and every episode moves forward a year but actually i sat there saying .
POD1000000038_S0000033	i have been questioned about it 57 times
POD1000000038_S0000035	do you know what else moves forward a year in every episode downton abbey
POD1000000038_S0000036	and so did upstairs downstairs many years ago it is actually not a format of drama i have invented it is simply the fact that this drama is going to the future by a year every episode that had people scared but in terms of drama in terms of how the characters are getting on who loves who
POD1000000038_S0000037	who is going out with who who is cross with who who loves who to take yearly jumps in that is a very simple dramatic device
POD1000000038_S0000038	i knew that would work i had the confidence of those forebears to say this will work
POD1000000038_S0000039	and it was to get that sort of creep into the story which is
POD1000000038_S0000041	in societies when dictators arise or where huge changes are made and where society might swing from left to right or right to left it does not happen overnight that is why i wanted
POD1000000038_S0000042	what ends up as like a 15 year span on the show is to show these things slowly creeping up on you and actually you are more concerned with having your tea or falling in love
POD1000000038_S0000043	or having a divorce that is actually the stuff the meat and drink of your life while the bigger shadows are falling on you unseen so i needed that stretch to show the small picture of people living within a bigger picture
POD1000000038_S0000044	so episode 6 introduces a virus and with the coronavirus happening right now is that something you would have done differently
POD1000000038_S0000045	in the show or is that just one of the many sort of things going on in the future
POD1000000038_S0000046	it is interesting because actually it comes up in episode 6 as a means of isolating people within the story to be honest now i am seeing a virus like this in action again
POD1000000038_S0000047	it would have dominated episode 6 too much actually it is amazing how it dominates our every conversation now and episode 6 as a drama not as a document of the real world but as a drama has stories to wrap up
POD1000000038_S0000049	we need to know
POD1000000038_S0000050	whether lovers will be reunited whether marriages will stay together so it is very interesting now that i sort of think that i mean i had done a lot of research into viruses and what would happen so i kind of you know i knew the differences between endemics and pandemics
POD1000000038_S0000051	but i chose to background it and this is a separate drama itself really my goodness this is strange days again just keep getting madder what did we used to talk about in 2006 what what did we talk about can you remember interest rates
POD1000000038_S0000052	cows and cattle what did we talk about guinea pigs i do not know
POD1000000038_S0000053	i can not remember what we talked about 2 weeks ago even i mean do you feel anxious like when you reach inside creatively and pull out
POD1000000038_S0000054	what in some ways is like the worst case scenario that we are imagining in our brains and put them on screen does that make you anxious
POD1000000038_S0000056	i talk about my family that lovely family i was just describing one of my nieces has just had twins so one year ago they had lovely lovely baby twins and that makes me anxious i kind of look at them thinking
POD1000000038_S0000057	you know i do believe in global warming i do believe we are in trouble i do believe that as a result the political situation i think the heating up of our political situation is tied into global warming
POD1000000038_S0000058	on a vast scale that is very and for the 1st time in my life you look at little kids thinking i am not sure you will have a better world i am not sure at all you will so i have gotten anxiety and as a writer that is bound to come out in my work
POD1000000038_S0000059	i do have to say that years and years does have a happy ending a happy ish ending a sort of bittersweet but it is a happy ending because i also believe in that i think real life could be disastrous enough and i think when you are writing fiction you should reach for a happy ending
POD1000000038_S0000060	because it is hard work happy endings are tough to find and miserable endings are easy so i try to look for hope in it and i do have hope in people actually that .
POD1000000038_S0000061	we are great survivors and great thinkers and actually i think most people are nice i think people are fundamentally nice that word we are not allowed to use nice because it seems like a bland word but i think it is a beautiful word people are nice
POD1000000038_S0000062	and i have to hope that our niceness prevails
POD1000000038_S0000063	russell t davis created and wrote years and years
POD1000000038_S0000065	for some related links if you had not heard of years and years like me you are really not alone it did show up on a bunch of end of 2019 lists as some of the year is best tv

POD1000000047_S0000000	welcome to the 80000 hours podcast this interview with david spiegelhalter is a bit unusual in that it was actually recorded 2 years ago
POD1000000047_S0000002	we were considering starting a podcast back then and i recorded this trial episode with my colleague jess whittlestone but ultimately we did not have the time to go ahead with the project but i thought why not dig it up and release it now
POD1000000047_S0000004	david spiegelholder is a statistician at the university of cambridge and something of an academic celebrity in the uk
POD1000000047_S0000006	part of his role is to improve the public understanding of risk especially everyday risks we face like getting cancer or dying in a car crash as a result he is regularly in the media explaining the numbers in the news
POD1000000047_S0000007	trying to assist both ordinary people and politicians to focus on the most important risks that confront us and avoid being distracted by flashy risks that perhaps do not actually have that much impact
POD1000000047_S0000009	to help make sense of the uncertainties we face in life he is had to invent concepts like the micro life or a 30 minute change in life expectancy
POD1000000047_S0000011	we gave him a call because we wanted to learn whether he thought a lifetime of work had actually made that much difference to the world enjoy
POD1000000047_S0000013	here at the center for effective altruism we are interested in finding ways to compare what it means to do good and to figure out which ways of doing good do the most good so we ask questions like which charity should you donate to if you want to help as many people as possible
POD1000000047_S0000014	what careers should you follow if you want to improve the world and which cause areas have the largest impact these are the sorts of questions that we think it is really important to get clear so you know how you can make a real difference
POD1000000047_S0000016	to help us answer some of these questions we are joined by professor david spiegelhalter the winton professor for the public understanding of risk at cambridge university professor spiegelhalter spent much of his life trying to improve public understanding of statistics science and risk in ordinary life
POD1000000047_S0000018	he regularly appears in the uk media and writes on his blog understanding uncertainty it is great to have you with us today david
POD1000000047_S0000019	all right
POD1000000047_S0000021	so we have got so many things we would like to talk about we will see how far we get but 1st tell us a bit about who you are and your position
POD1000000047_S0000022	yeah i have got a strange job really i am in the maths department at cambridge and i teach statistics to the undergraduates but i am actually funded by a hedge fund winton capital management and have endowed my chair in order to improve education
POD1000000047_S0000023	the public understanding of statistics and risk and so what i have done since i have had that job for the last 8 years is i suppose to try to join the general community of people who are
POD1000000047_S0000024	trying to improve the way numbers in particular are discussed in society
POD1000000047_S0000026	so what kinds of questions do you research and what outreach do you do to help the public understand numbers and uncertainty better
POD1000000047_S0000027	well i get asked to do a huge amount of stuff i suppose helping in various agencies communicating risk about the sort of cancer risk about the risk of screening for example risks and benefits of screening my background is in medical statistics
POD1000000047_S0000028	so that is what i get to do quite a lot but i have done tv programs about climate change i have done radio stuff about you know all sorts of threats to society fukushima and so on
POD1000000047_S0000029	and everything to do with trying to get a handle on what are the important threats to us individually and how we might be able to make comparisons between those
POD1000000047_S0000030	i am very interested in rather than sort of the great global existential risks i am more interested in the things that affect us all individually about how we eat our exercise transport and so on
POD1000000047_S0000032	so yeah one of the things that i find really interesting in this area is that there is a lot of evidence that people tend to be very poor at estimating lots of different probabilities and so end up
POD1000000047_S0000033	overestimating the scale of some problems or risks that they face and underestimating others from your experience what kinds of problems do you think that people tend to be most prone to overestimate or underestimate and get wrong in very harmful ways
POD1000000047_S0000034	well there has been a lot of research on this by psychologists as you know and and of course when we talk about people i always include myself in this and
POD1000000047_S0000035	i am subject to the whims of my emotional gut reactions as much as anybody else i am not making any claim about some superior knowledge and rationality compared with everybody else because
POD1000000047_S0000036	we just know that the way we respond to things to simplify a lot we can think in 2 different ways we can respond with our guts or we can try to engage our brain and think slowly about stuff
POD1000000047_S0000037	and this is so relevant when it comes to risk particularly this idea that what is available to us this availability heuristic is very strong
POD1000000047_S0000038	what we hear in the news we hear about ebola we hear about terrorism we hear about the latest threat that might be in what we eat and the way we travel and we get very concerned about this whether it is a plane crash or whatever
POD1000000047_S0000039	and because that is what is in the news that is what is available to us that is what is so prominent but of course so many of these risks are actually very small indeed this is not a threat to us particularly at all
POD1000000047_S0000040	and the things that are much more familiar and we do not hear much of you know for example just heart disease cancer all those sort of stuff that we get a large amount of that is because of the way we live our lack of exercise our crummy diet
POD1000000047_S0000041	and so on of course people get a bit bored with that and do not get so concerned about it
POD1000000047_S0000042	do you feel you have had any success improving public understanding of risks and getting people to focus on the stuff that really matters
POD1000000047_S0000043	0 i do not know it is very difficult to measure i mean it would be great to think so i have been involved in some good projects that i have been very proud of for example the redesign of the cancer screening leaflets in the uk which present the benefits and risks of cancer screening
POD1000000047_S0000044	cancer screening in a very balanced way they are hugely innovative in that they do not actually recommend people go for screening they just say well these are the possible benefits
POD1000000047_S0000045	these are the possible harms make up your own mind and i believe that is the right way to go about communicating risk it is not to say 0 you have got to watch out you have got to watch out this is terrible say well if you do this this might happen or it might not happen
POD1000000047_S0000046	and weigh it up and actually give people credit for some intelligence which i think people basically are i do not think people are so stupid what i am proud of is being part of a general community that is very strong in britain to do with public engagement in science
POD1000000047_S0000047	and
POD1000000047_S0000049	i am just a small part of that because it covers the material on the radio stuff on television stuff in some newspapers and in various agencies for example the statistics authority
POD1000000047_S0000050	which is just trying to take a much more critical attitude to the way that numbers and evidence are used in society and i think it works in britain we are rather good compared with most people about .
POD1000000047_S0000052	we do not have these massive fears of vaccinations of nuclear power of even gmos and so i think this is a sign that we in this country have developed quite a good public engagement with science communities
POD1000000047_S0000054	yeah i was actually going to ask you about what potential you think there is for young people who want to have an impact with their career going into a career path similar to your own and trying to get into public outreach and engagement to .
POD1000000047_S0000055	to have a broader impact rather than necessarily just doing research in academia so how hard do you think it is to do this kind of thing and it sounds like this is definitely something you wish more academics did work on
POD1000000047_S0000056	absolutely i mean i really come to it quite late as a real part of my career as i said again because a philanthropist in a hedge fund provided the funding for me to be able to do this full time
POD1000000047_S0000057	but i was doing some before as part of my job and i increasingly feel that it is actually a duty of academics who after all are publicly funded for a certain proportion of them to really spend some time on public engagement it does not suit everybody
POD1000000047_S0000058	not for everyone at all although i think everybody should have a website explaining what they do and that this should be also supported and there should be incentives within the career structure for academics to do this
POD1000000047_S0000059	and i am quite pleased that in cambridge for example when we are looking at promotion of people their public engagement is taken very seriously indeed it is something i strongly support so it is not for everybody but i think it is a very important thing for academics to do
POD1000000047_S0000060	as they are doing their work almost in whatever area it has a relevance to society and it can potentially
POD1000000047_S0000062	improve society and they should be working on it
POD1000000047_S0000063	i personally think that statistics is a particularly important area for improvement of society i feel this very strongly and many statisticians do and in terms of public engagement
POD1000000047_S0000064	the royal statistical society has now got an initiative of training up statistics ambassadors young statisticians who want to do this who really want to get out there and communicate the importance of their work and try to improve the way things are done with numbers and evidence
POD1000000047_S0000065	i think this is so exciting such fun
POD1000000047_S0000067	so a lot of young people we meet are thinking of going into academia do you feel like that is a good place to be to have a big impact in the world of course there are also some drawbacks that you might be aware of from your experience of being in academia
POD1000000047_S0000068	yes yeah i am not i would not necessarily say you know to recommend yes you really should go into academia you know it does not suit everybody and frankly the paper that i started it is quite it seems very tough now
POD1000000047_S0000069	so with most careers there seem to be a lot more pressures on them than there used to be so it can be quite a tough call i think but there is potential to do a lot of good stuff and people i work with know in other areas whether they are working in
POD1000000047_S0000070	natural natural natural threats natural disasters when we are working in botany when they work in any area and plant sciences whatever are really dedicated to trying to improve
POD1000000047_S0000071	the lot of the world and i am so impressed by their dedication but it is a tough job and you do not necessarily see in this sort of push to you got to publish the work you have got to do all this going to go through all this
POD1000000047_S0000073	all this business in order to build one is career it does not necessarily appear at 1st that you are actually doing great good in what you do very little of it you can see a direct impact however as i know that what is very good about it is that it
POD1000000047_S0000074	it is building a lot of transferable skills that you can use and i find that in my statistical skills for example are in a massive demand by all sorts of agencies i could point in particular to the
POD1000000047_S0000075	the importance of the millennium development goals and the sustainable development goals which are
POD1000000047_S0000076	which are replacing them in which the sort of monitoring of the state of welfare in different countries around the world has become absolutely vital and just being able to measure things and know what is going on and
POD1000000047_S0000077	to develop good ways to do surveys to actually look at what works how you can improve these measures has become enormously vital enormously important so i think well again i am coming back to the fact that i think statistics is
POD1000000047_S0000078	a particularly valuable area to go into
POD1000000047_S0000080	yeah absolutely and just a little bit more broadly you know the key idea behind effector altruism is that we want to try and figure out which altruistic activities which charities which career paths which causes do the most good and we think that being able to
POD1000000047_S0000081	measure things or at least trying to measure things is incredibly valuable in making progress on those questions but obviously these are many of these questions are incredibly difficult to answer so a common criticism that we often get is people saying something like
POD1000000047_S0000082	0 it is impossible to figure out which charities or careers do the most good so you are wasting your tough trying and you should just go with your gut or you know help personal causes what do you think of this kind of objection and do you think that there is anything to it
POD1000000047_S0000083	you know concern about there being too much uncertainty you know we often respond by saying that you know it does not mean that we should not try and estimation is clearly the best we have but yeah what are your thoughts on this challenge and
POD1000000047_S0000085	i mean this is not a comment that is just restricted to the area that you are talking about it happens all the time it used to happen in healthcare people used to say 0 you can not put a value on a human life
POD1000000047_S0000086	we have just got to do all we can to do good and we have to just go with our guts essentially that view now certainly in the uk has been completely discredited you can put a value on a human life we do all the time
POD1000000047_S0000087	i am not sure everyone would agree but .
POD1000000047_S0000088	not for everyone you can agree and of course
POD1000000047_S0000089	but you have to
POD1000000047_S0000090	but nice for example has been doing this for over a decade
POD1000000047_S0000092	putting a value on the marginal benefit of particular healthcare intervention and assessing what should be supported under the national health service according to these formal criteria we know this is not perfect we know this does not measure everything
POD1000000047_S0000093	but it is explicitly transparent and they have done their best and i think it has been a massive success and a huge example to other countries as to how you can go about it now we know it is never perfect it is never perfect
POD1000000047_S0000094	but because people have been trying to take that approach which i think has been extremely beneficial and healthy and move it into other areas now how can you do it so people are trying to do it with the environment how can we measure the value of a tree well people are trying to measure the value of a tree
POD1000000047_S0000095	and i do not know about it what are trees worth there is quite a lot
POD1000000047_S0000097	working out all these different trying to measure the benefit of a healthy sustainable environment et cetera what is the value of the species
POD1000000047_S0000098	i mean it seems it is too easy to sit back and say 0 you can not do it you can not measure that well you can have a good go you can have a good go so as you say it is always a balance between trying your best realizing you are never going to be able to do it
POD1000000047_S0000099	but not to be put off having a good go so it is like a lot of things we do in statistics trying to measure things trying to model things that we always know what we do is inadequate but that does not mean you can not do useful things
POD1000000047_S0000101	can you tell us a bit more about nice and how they prioritize health treatments within the united kingdom
POD1000000047_S0000102	yeah i mean that is something i have worked on as a medical statistician i have been a huge supporter of nice and essentially what they do is when they decide whether to have a new vaccine or whether to decide to have a new recommend vaccine
POD1000000047_S0000103	for drugs to be paid for under the nhs for example they will look at what is the expected benefit of that intervention and what is the expected cost and then they look at how much it is going to cost to
POD1000000047_S0000104	and provide an extra what they call a quality adjusted life year so one year of life that is discounted if it is poor quality you will discount it will not be worth the whole year and then essentially they can make the comparison
POD1000000047_S0000105	and they look if something comes in at less than £20000 a quality just almost as paid for you know just yet i will pay for it under the nhs if it is more than about 30000 then they really try to
POD1000000047_S0000107	we do not want to pay for this
POD1000000047_S0000108	and try to go back to the drug company to renegotiate a price for example between 20000 and 30000 well you know that is more in the gray zone so and this has been enormously beneficial partly
POD1000000047_S0000109	in order to go back to drug companies and get them to reduce their prices but and also to see that some interventions for example cancer screening come in extremely cheap they are just worth doing it also means you have to be explicit for example on how much you value the future
POD1000000047_S0000110	rather than the present because they put in a discount rate currently 3.5% now that means that a year of life in 25 years time for example is only worth about half what a year of life now is worth and that is taken into account
POD1000000047_S0000111	and now that of course is controversial and if we are talking about big policy decisions for example about climate change that is far too big a discount rate we would not care less about the world in 100 years time if we use that discount so in different areas
POD1000000047_S0000112	you might be wanting to use a different discount rate but these are taking economic ideas and moving them into very human decisions
POD1000000047_S0000113	and i think they are enormously helpful and illuminating but they are never perfect
POD1000000047_S0000115	yeah i have actually written an article with professor toby ord about why we should not discount health even though we should discount financial returns about why it is appropriate in one case and not in the other so we will put up a link to that on the website
POD1000000047_S0000116	a lot of people who are planning out their careers they feel just overwhelmed by uncertainty they do not know how much they are going to earn in one career or what is the chances of getting into academia or being elected to parliament
POD1000000047_S0000117	how do you think people ought to make decisions when they are just surrounded by so much uncertainty
POD1000000047_S0000118	well i mean you could say that we are always surrounded by this again this is common to everything we do we never know what is going to happen in the future which is great people do not want to know what is going to happen in the future people do not even know what they are going to get for christmas let alone what is going to happen for the rest of their lives
POD1000000047_S0000119	and so this is just a common problem and we need to distinguish what we might call risk and uncertainty risk is when it is a very well defined problem the short term issues buying lottery tickets when we know what the chances are
POD1000000047_S0000120	and then we can sort of take a rational approach when we are dealing with deeper uncertainty when really i am not even sure what the options are what might how our lives might develop then it is very difficult to take a completely formal approach and so i would not
POD1000000047_S0000121	trying to say 0 we should be able to do all this mathematically at all however the basics of qualitative ideas of thinking through a rational decision are still very valuable because you think of you know what are the options available
POD1000000047_S0000122	and what are the possibilities and what are the possible consequences of what i might do now there is always an adequate you are never going to be able to think of everything however by thinking through that some things might become immediately apparent some immediate rankings
POD1000000047_S0000123	what is preferable and not preferable might become apparent and otherwise we might need to fall back i think on broader strategies for making decisions in the face of
POD1000000047_S0000124	what we call deeper uncertainty now this is a deeply contested area when governments make policies very often they are in these situations where they can not even think of all the things that might happen so they are in this situation of deeper uncertainty
POD1000000047_S0000125	and people have suggested various ways to go about it the 1st thing is not to think that you can optimize you can not be perfect you cannot be perfect so the sort of suggestions that people make in terms of general decision making in these contexts
POD1000000047_S0000126	so to do with flexibility and resilience that you want to be you do not want to commit yourself to something you are not going to be able to change because you can not predict everything that is going to happen so you want to build in flexibility and adaptivity to your decision making
POD1000000047_S0000127	and that is the same in any business any government any project at all and the other thing is to build in resilience in which you essentially can cope with the unexpected and things and that means both you know the possibility of really good things happening
POD1000000047_S0000128	as well as the possibility of really bad things happening that you are making sure that you have not put all your eggs in one basket essentially so if something goes wrong you have not completely gone up a total blind alley that you can not renegotiate
POD1000000047_S0000129	which means operating from the basis most robust basis as possible so it means not trying to optimize the single path but building in robustness which means i think in terms of career of course building in
POD1000000047_S0000130	transferable skills that you are going to be able to use in a variety of circumstances so i think these are standard tactics for responding to deeper uncertainty which can be used in any situation
POD1000000047_S0000132	yeah that is definitely something that the organization 80000 hours who advise people on you know how to have a big impact with their careers really focus on is especially early in your career like keep your options open and choose things that are robust under you know lots of different possible things happening
POD1000000047_S0000134	one of the question that we find we come up against a fair amount and thinking about careers and charities and all kinds of things is you know how do you go about choosing between a small chance of some really huge outcome like you know saving the world from a pandemic that kills 10s
POD1000000047_S0000136	against some high probability of a very moderate or a more moderate outcome so you know helping people in your local community this seems like a very difficult thing to deal with do you have any thoughts on how people can go about making these kinds of decisions
POD1000000047_S0000137	yeah very difficult but again these are common decisions in our lives always in our lives do we go for the high risk option or the safer option i personally think that
POD1000000047_S0000138	actually a mixed strategy is something that businesses i think would recommend although that is not what i am involved in in any investment decisions but often i think people would take an idea of a portfolio
POD1000000047_S0000139	of risk making because these are all risks you can not guarantee that they are going to do these are all risks so that you might have a certain amount invested in rather safe things with a safe return you are pretty sure
POD1000000047_S0000140	that what you are going to do is going to have a reasonable return and that you really can predict the consequences of what you are using your career or your money for what you are giving for on the other hand on more speculative terms
POD1000000047_S0000141	where you may be supporting something that actually might not come to anything either because the solution is promising
POD1000000047_S0000142	will not work or the threat will not arise in the 1st place so i think that is a mixed strategy in these circumstances again i would not want to just put all the eggs in one basket
POD1000000047_S0000144	that would not be appropriate i also personally feel that and this is completely my personal reaction about gibbons is that i quite like a mixed strategy in which some things are the bigger
POD1000000047_S0000146	slightly anonymous
POD1000000047_S0000147	well you are giving money to the poor
POD1000000047_S0000149	large organization is doing something which is contributing in a probably fairly predictable way to improving things for people versus you know the more personal ones where you do have the personal
POD1000000047_S0000150	contact and you might get slightly more emotional feedback from that partly because that might encourage you to take on a more good feedback from the altruism might encourage you to take on a bigger altruism
POD1000000047_S0000151	a bigger commitment in the future
POD1000000047_S0000153	so there are various ways of thinking about how to quantify the risks or possible gains associated with an activity can you explain what a micromort or a microlife is
POD1000000047_S0000154	0 yeah yeah these are units that well we invented the microlife someone else invented the micromortar it is just a way of trying to get a common scale for in particular case of micromortars acute risks the things that might kill you on the spot but otherwise you are healthy
POD1000000047_S0000155	and it is a one in a 10 chance of dying because of an action you might take so skydiving or something is approximately 7 10 microwatts and micro life which is something to do with chronic risks which is the risk of
POD1000000047_S0000156	i think the stuff i am quite interested in which is bad lifestyle lack of exercise or smoking or drinking or bad diet whatever which is not going to kill you on the spot but
POD1000000047_S0000157	is likely to shorten your life not definitely at all maybe not but probably will and so it is a reduction of half an hour in your life expectancy i find these quite useful because it enables you to compare all these different
POD1000000047_S0000158	things like diet and smoking and exercise and things and makes me for example you know obviously smoking is where you get the biggest return or the biggest you know in terms of not smoking you get the huge biggest return and
POD1000000047_S0000160	drinking at low doses well actually it does not make much difference
POD1000000047_S0000162	a huge concern unless you are really swinging it down but exercise again i think is extremely important and diet is important
POD1000000047_S0000163	it just gives you a feeling of what is you know where the you know where the priorities are which of course it is all a bit obvious they are the priorities that people do in public health but it makes you slightly unconcerned about other things that people might be really concerned about
POD1000000047_S0000165	so these concepts were invented to help people get a better understanding and make better decisions do you think that we could invent new concepts to help people think about how they can do more good in the world
POD1000000047_S0000167	yeah a micro outro or
POD1000000047_S0000169	it is difficult i mean the qaly is a good one if your area of cause is to do with saving lives or improving health and lethal risk to people then qaly is a good one it is already established you can look at how many
POD1000000047_S0000171	so how many years of life are you going to gain from your intervention and we know that if you are giving money to some particular charities
POD1000000047_S0000173	promote
POD1000000047_S0000174	they are extremely cost effective in that way
POD1000000047_S0000175	it is more difficult if you have a broader idea for example of supporting education of preserving the natural environment and so on quite how to put a number on that within a particular area of cause
POD1000000047_S0000176	the cause then you might be able to do it but having metrics that
POD1000000047_S0000178	go right across different areas
POD1000000047_S0000180	is difficult and i know that people criticize that
POD1000000047_S0000182	attempt to do it
POD1000000047_S0000183	i still think it is worth trying to do and people are struggling to do this within
POD1000000047_S0000185	within the environment and so on now i do not think i have got any great idea to be honest i mean one possibility of course is .
POD1000000047_S0000186	is looking at general measures of well being which again people are doing it is measured by national governments now to try to measure well being in terms of how people feel about their lives
POD1000000047_S0000187	so general well being indices which are not just health related or length of life related i think have got great potential but you are not going to be able to get the perfect nasal memory
POD1000000047_S0000188	so people are often asked you know how would you rate how good your life is going from one to 10 typically they give answers between 6 and 8 at least in the uk
POD1000000047_S0000189	maybe we could have a micro happy which would be something as good as moving some run from 6 to 7 or 7 to 8 on this welfare scale
POD1000000047_S0000190	yeah yeah yeah no yes yeah yeah exactly i think that you know those scales well actually i find them very revealing when people do mention them particularly across cultures as you said
POD1000000047_S0000192	everyone says 7
POD1000000047_S0000194	maybe 7 but it also reflects his idea why it is not bad you know
POD1000000047_S0000195	it must not grumble
POD1000000047_S0000197	you know it could be better but must not rumble you know so slightly british stoic attitude so i think it is almost predictable what people are going to respond but i find for example the age distribution of these responses and how the age distribution varies across cultures
POD1000000047_S0000198	extremely interesting and the idea of whether one could move
POD1000000047_S0000200	groups of people on that scale and would be very important and when i think of these sort of charities some of the ones i get to you know
POD1000000047_S0000201	which are not directly i do not think going to actually make people live longer but you would hope to would improve people is well being and sense of happiness considerably
POD1000000047_S0000202	yeah it is a fascinating area of research and there are significant international differences so i think in the uk and america and australia people do tend to give 7 or maybe 8 if they are feeling particularly good but in south america people are just for some reason more exuberant
POD1000000047_S0000203	and tend to often give 8s even when they are relatively poor and by contrast in eastern europe and eastern asia like japan and china people tend to give relatively low scores relative to how life seems to be going from the outside
POD1000000047_S0000204	yeah yeah yeah and i know people in different cultures i think in africa they are even lower people are very .
POD1000000047_S0000206	yeah there are some countries where the average is as low as a 4 out of 10 which maybe half of people are giving less than 4 which is a bit unfortunate
POD1000000047_S0000207	but again i mean these are very culturally i think specific and so but i think what we want to see is relative changes relative changes perhaps you know compared with
POD1000000047_S0000208	the average in that community that we are looking for that you know you can not just get everyone up to 8 or whatever i mean there are different very different cultural attitudes to do with i think that are reflected in those questions
POD1000000047_S0000209	yeah so by trying to estimate risks or the size of problems in this quantitative way do you think we risk being biased against approaches that are harder to quantify
POD1000000047_S0000210	yeah it always is a problem that people start believing that the model the measure which is only a very inadequate thing starts becoming the thing that you are in fact then trying to focus on
POD1000000047_S0000211	to the detriment of all others and there is a real problem with over metricising any activity pretending that you can measure the benefits of everything
POD1000000047_S0000213	academic world of course is a
POD1000000047_S0000214	real example of that where people start getting obsessed with impact factors and nonsense like that so there is a real danger with believing these things too much at the same time
POD1000000047_S0000215	i think we should have a damn good go at trying to do it just because something is difficult and cannot be done perfectly does not mean that you can not at least have a stab at it
POD1000000047_S0000217	you know often
POD1000000047_S0000218	with these things you might get really clear rankings you know great precision might not be required in order to determine that actually this is not you know not an effective use of resources compared with sedenta
POD1000000047_S0000220	yeah and i think that rather than giving us a perfect answer to all questions using you know models and looking at different factors can as you say just help you to identify like clear differences or areas where you need to get more information because you just have no idea how to factor that in or
POD1000000047_S0000221	or something so it can definitely be very useful finally just to what extent do you think that the average person can benefit from a better understanding of statistics learning more statistics you know either in their everyday lives or in being more effective as altruists
POD1000000047_S0000222	and to what extent do you think i guess relating back to the past question it could potentially limit us
POD1000000047_S0000224	yeah i think i think yeah of course i do of course i would say this would not i but yeah i do believe that people would benefit from having a greater idea of stats and measurement and number and quantity
POD1000000047_S0000225	and the frailties of that as well because the point about understanding statistics is both to understand their strengths and their weaknesses the 2 are absolutely hand in hand and what people tend to do at the moment who are not you know i suppose not confident
POD1000000047_S0000226	with numbers and how they are constructed because in the end they are whole are always constructed someone has chosen what to measure and is that they tend to either accept them as if they are god given truth and that is the number and that is so vital
POD1000000047_S0000227	and that is it that is what we are looking for or reject them out of hand 0 you can not put numbers in
POD1000000047_S0000229	down lies in statistics and this sort of nonsense and those 2 extreme views are both equally idiotic
POD1000000047_S0000231	but if you have got a slightly more nuanced view you will realize that statistics and numbers and measurement are incredibly valuable tool but they are just a tool and they have their frailties and inadequacies so you both need to be
POD1000000047_S0000233	teach and understand the strength and the limitations and well i am involved in a number of educational projects in which we are trying to do just that
POD1000000047_S0000235	so it is really a matter of trying to assign the appropriate weight to each different kind of evidence or each different piece of evidence that comes your way
POD1000000047_S0000236	i think i mean in the end what statistics is to do with is quantitative evidence that is what we are talking about and evidence can be good bad or you know along a whole scale it is not a true or false
POD1000000047_S0000237	it is just evidence and you are trying to weigh up that evidence which we do all the time in our lives we do this but our guts tend to be a bit fallible when it comes to weighing up evidence
POD1000000047_S0000239	too influenced by certain salient things that attract our attention and so actually standing back and trying to be a bit cooler about weighing up evidence i think is a really valuable thing to try to do in all areas of life it does not matter what
POD1000000047_S0000240	yeah absolutely which is not to say that you should completely discount that gut feeling but often just supplement it with some extra evidence or statistics
POD1000000047_S0000241	i got my guts
POD1000000047_S0000243	i do not trust him a bit but i still you know go with him
POD1000000047_S0000244	yeah i think that is about all we have got time for now but thanks so much david this has been very informative and really interesting
POD1000000047_S0000245	okay thanks very much
POD1000000047_S0000247	right if you would like to hear more from professor spiegelhalter then you can find his blog understanding uncertainty online and he is also often on the radio in the uk in particular on more or less on bbc 4
POD1000000048_S0000001	hi i am rob director of research at 80000 hours today i am speaking with myles brundage research fellow at the university of oxford is future of humanity institute
POD1000000048_S0000002	he studies the social implications surrounding the development of new technologies and has a particular interest in artificial general intelligence that is an ai system that could do most or all of the tasks humans could do
POD1000000048_S0000003	miles research has been supported by the national science foundation the bipartisan policy center and the future of life institute thanks for making time to talk to us today miles
POD1000000048_S0000004	thanks for having me
POD1000000048_S0000005	so 1st up maybe just tell us a bit about your background and what questions you are looking into at the moment
POD1000000048_S0000007	sure so i used to work on energy policy when i was living in washington d c and i have gradually moved into ai policy over the past few years because it seems like it was more of a neglected area and could have a very large impact
POD1000000048_S0000008	so i recently started at the future of humanity institute and i am also concurrently finishing up my phd in human and social dimensions of science and technology at arizona state university
POD1000000048_S0000009	so in both capacities i am interested in what sorts of methods would be useful for thinking about ai in a rigorous way and particularly the uncertainty of possible futures surrounding ai
POD1000000048_S0000010	and i have a few more specific interests such as openness and artificial intelligence and the risks related to bad actors
POD1000000048_S0000011	okay so are you trying to predict what is going to happen and when and what sort of effects it will have
POD1000000048_S0000012	so not necessarily predict per se but at least understand what is plausible i think that it is very difficult to predict with any high confidence what is going to happen and when
POD1000000048_S0000013	but understanding for example what sorts of actions people could carry out with ai systems today or in the foreseeable future in different domains like cybersecurity
POD1000000048_S0000014	and information operations production of fake news automatically and autonomous drones and so forth
POD1000000048_S0000015	i think understanding the security landscape of those sorts of things does not necessarily require a very detailed forecast of when exactly something will occur so much as understanding what is technologically possible given near term trends
POD1000000048_S0000017	you do not necessarily have to say this is when this particular accident or malicious behavior will occur but just that these are the sorts of risks that we need to be prepared for
POD1000000048_S0000018	right right does that bring you into contact with organizations that are developing ais like google
POD1000000048_S0000020	yeah absolutely so those organizations have an interest in making sure that ai is as beneficial as possible
POD1000000048_S0000022	keenly aware of the fact that they can be misused and that there might be accident risks associated with them
POD1000000048_S0000023	so for example i held a workshop fairly recently on the connection between bad actors and ai and what sorts of bad actors we might be concerned about in this space and we had some participation from some of those groups
POD1000000048_S0000024	right right what kinds of bad actors are you thinking of
POD1000000048_S0000025	i think there you can look at it from a number of different perspectives so depending on the domain that you are interested in you might end up with different sorts of actors
POD1000000048_S0000026	so in the case of physical harm associated with ai you might look at autonomous weapons and the weaponization of consumer drones and in that case it is something that would be particularly appealing to state actors as well as terrorists
POD1000000048_S0000027	we are already seeing the weaponization of consumer drones though without much autonomy if any in the case of isis overseas
POD1000000048_S0000028	so there are cases like that where we can foresee that particular groups when given more advanced capabilities such as higher baseline levels of autonomy and consumer drones
POD1000000048_S0000029	would be able to and would like to carry out damage on a larger scale
POD1000000048_S0000030	but in other cases it is less clear so for example there are concerns around mass surveillance and it is often not totally clear whether one should be more concerned about states or corporations
POD1000000048_S0000031	depending on what sorts of risk you are concerned about for example corporations currently have a lot of data on people
POD1000000048_S0000032	there have been a lot of concerns raised about the use of ai to make decisions that have critical impacts on people is lives
POD1000000048_S0000033	such as denying loans and court decisions and so forth that are being informed by often not very transparent algorithms
POD1000000048_S0000034	so those are some concerns but there is also a potentially different class of concerns around authoritarian states using ai for oppression
POD1000000048_S0000035	so i think there is a range of risks but generally speaking there is going to be a steady increase in the floor of the skill level as these ai technologies diffuse
POD1000000048_S0000036	that is there will be more and more capabilities available to people at the bottom of the scale that is individuals as well as people with more access to computing power and money and data at the higher end
POD1000000048_S0000037	so it is not totally clear how to think about that because on the one hand you might expect that
POD1000000048_S0000038	the biggest actors are the most concerning because they have the most skill and resources but on the other hand they also are sometimes in the case of democratic governments
POD1000000048_S0000039	held accountable to citizens and in the case of corporations held accountable to stakeholders you might also think that you would be more concerned about individual rogue actors
POD1000000048_S0000040	so that is an issue i am still trying to think through in the context of the report that i am writing based on that workshop
POD1000000048_S0000041	right so people often distinguish between the short term risks from ai like self driving cars not working properly or algorithmic bias
POD1000000048_S0000042	and then the longer term concerns of what we are going to do once an artificial intelligence is as smart as humans or potentially much much more intelligent which one of those do you spend more time working on
POD1000000048_S0000043	i try to focus on issues that span different time horizons so i think ai and security is something that we are already seeing some early instances of today
POD1000000048_S0000044	so it is already being used for detection of cyber threats for example and the production of vulnerabilities in software there is a lot of research going on
POD1000000048_S0000045	with an example being the darpa cyber grand challenge recently where there was automated hacking and automated defense
POD1000000048_S0000046	so there is already stuff happening on the front of ai and security as well as the economics of ai and issues surrounding privacy
POD1000000048_S0000047	but it is not totally clear whether the issues in the future will just be straightforward extensions of those or whether there will be qualitatively different
POD1000000048_S0000049	i think it is important to think about what is happening today and imagine how it might progressively develop into a more extreme future as well as to think about possible discontinuities when ai progresses more quickly
POD1000000048_S0000050	right right so i should say this point that we have a profile up on our website about the potential upsides and downsides of artificial intelligence where we go through all of the basics
POD1000000048_S0000051	and miles you have a forthcoming guide to work on ai policy and strategy that we are going to link to so here we are going to try to go beyond that so if you find yourself a little bit confused then potentially just go and read one of those documents 1st
POD1000000048_S0000052	so which policy or strategy questions do you see as most important for us to answer in order to ensure that the development of artificial intelligence goes well rather than in a bad way
POD1000000048_S0000053	i think there are a lot of questions and some of the ones i was talking about earlier surrounding security and preventing the weaponization of ai by dangerous actors is one
POD1000000048_S0000054	and there are also other issues that have been widely discussed in the media and by academics such as accountability of algorithms and transparency the economic impacts of ai and so forth
POD1000000048_S0000055	but one that i think is particularly important particularly over the long term and this is a case where there might be a need to think about possible discontinuities
POD1000000048_S0000056	is coordination surrounding ai safety so there has been a lot of attention called to ai safety in the past few years and there is starting to be a lot of concrete and successful research on the problem of avoiding certain ai safety failure modes
POD1000000048_S0000057	like wireheading and value misalignment and so forth but there has been less attention paid to how do you actually incentivize people to act on the best practices and the good theoretical frameworks that are developed
POD1000000048_S0000058	assuming that they will be developed and that is a potentially big problem if there is a competitive situation between companies or between countries or both and there is an incentive to skimp on those safety measures
POD1000000048_S0000059	so there has been a little bit of work for example by armstrong et al at the future of humanity institute looking at arms race type scenarios involving ai where there would be an incentive to skimp
POD1000000048_S0000060	because you are concerned about losing the lead in an ai race and there might be significant we do not really know what the extent will be
POD1000000048_S0000061	but it might turn out that there are significant trade offs between safety and performance of ai systems so one might be tempted to in order to gain an advantage whether economic or military or intelligence wise
POD1000000048_S0000062	ramp up the capabilities of an ai system by adding more hardware adding more data adding more sensors and effectors and so forth but that might actually be dangerous if you do not understand the full behavioral envelope of the system
POD1000000048_S0000063	so to speak and how to constrain actors the human actors from doing that is a very difficult problem
POD1000000048_S0000064	so i along with some others at the future of humanity institute and others at different organizations have started thinking about what is an incentive compatible mechanism to ensure
POD1000000048_S0000065	that people do the right thing in that case that is to say we do not want to ask people to do something that is totally against their interests
POD1000000048_S0000066	if they actually do have an interest in developing these systems and protecting themselves militarily or otherwise but we also want to ensure that they are constrained in some sort of way
POD1000000048_S0000067	so one example would be an arranged this is not necessarily a fully fleshed out example but just to illustrate the sort of thing i am talking about
POD1000000048_S0000068	would be some arrangement between ai developers such that in order to gain access to the latest breakthroughs or the latest computing power
POD1000000048_S0000069	you would need to submit to some safety monitoring and adhere to certain best practices
POD1000000048_S0000070	that would create an incentive if you want to be on the cutting edge to participate in those safety protocols so again that is not a fully worked out example
POD1000000048_S0000071	but that is an example of the class of things that i would like to see more of so developing specific proposals for how to ensure that the right thing that is being developed on the technical front actually gets implemented
POD1000000048_S0000072	right do you look much at say what governments should be doing in this area whether there is regulations that we should be putting in place or at least preparing to put in place in future
POD1000000048_S0000073	yeah so i think that ties in with what i was saying a little bit in that one might envision that as ai capabilities develop
POD1000000048_S0000074	that it will be increasingly seen as a matter of national security that a country be on the leading edge so i think it is not super clear how to navigate that yet
POD1000000048_S0000075	i think there is some low hanging fruit so clearly in my opinion it would be beneficial for countries to have some experts in house in their governments who actually know something about ai
POD1000000048_S0000076	and are able to deal with crises as they arise if they arise and to be able to think carefully about the impacts of ai on the labor force for example
POD1000000048_S0000077	i think there is some low hanging fruit and some policies that have been developed for dealing with some of the near term issues but for the longer term issues
POD1000000048_S0000078	it is not super clear that we want to rush into a situation where governments are leading this if that would turn out to only accentuate the arms race dynamics
POD1000000048_S0000079	that we should be trying to avoid if ai is seen even more as a national security issue in an unhelpful way
POD1000000048_S0000080	so i think it is incumbent on those who are thinking about the long term policy issues around ai to develop a more positive proposal that involves not just
POD1000000048_S0000081	the us government getting involved for the purpose of accelerating american ai capabilities
POD1000000048_S0000082	but some more collaborative approach
POD1000000048_S0000083	i suppose with previous dangerous technologies like nuclear weapons or chemical or biological weapons there has been agreements to try to slow down their development and deployment is that something that could potentially happen here at the international level
POD1000000048_S0000085	i think it is possible to imagine some slowing down among a small number of actors
POD1000000048_S0000086	and we are fortunate that there is a high concentration of computing power and talent and skill in a fairly small number of organizations
POD1000000048_S0000087	so there is pretty much no chance of some random person out competing the top organizations at ai in a surprising way
POD1000000048_S0000088	it is possible that with some of the top companies and non profits as well as countries they could coordinate in some way
POD1000000048_S0000089	not to postpone ai across society for a long period of time but at least to be cautious in the later stages of development and to allow time for mutual vetting of safety procedures and things like that
POD1000000048_S0000090	so i think it is possible to imagine some sort of coordination but the technical and the political factors interact to a large extent
POD1000000048_S0000091	so to the extent that we actually have good safety measures that are efficient and that do not introduce a lot of overhead computational or otherwise into these systems
POD1000000048_S0000092	then we will be in a better place to actually get people to coordinate because it will not be imposing a lot of costs on them and likewise to the extent that we are able to coordinate better
POD1000000048_S0000093	it will be in a better position to actually get people to implement those mechanisms if they do impose some performance penalty
POD1000000048_S0000094	right so can you think of any major bits of progress we have made on ai strategy questions over the last couple of years
POD1000000048_S0000095	so the example i mentioned of the paper by armstrong et al called the racing to the precipice is one example and it presented sort of a stark version of the arms race scenario
POD1000000048_S0000096	though i think there are reasons to be more optimistic than are presented in that paper because they look at only a certain set of assumptions as with any model
POD1000000048_S0000097	but more generally i think there has been progress in the development of principles and criteria for good policies in recent years so for example with the asilomar conference and a set of asilomar ai principles
POD1000000048_S0000098	i think that was a good step towards developing some shared understanding around the need to avoid arms races and concerns over ai weaponization and so forth
POD1000000048_S0000099	but i still think that there is a lot of room for improvement
POD1000000048_S0000100	progress to be made so there was a paper put out by the future of humanity institute by nick bostrom kirk flynn and alan defoe recently that looks at policy desiderata for the development of machine superintelligence
POD1000000048_S0000101	and there is a lot of good material there but i think they would be the 1st to admit that we are still at the high level principle stage of developing these policies
POD1000000048_S0000102	so we have a better understanding of what we want to avoid than we did a few years ago and what a good policy proposal would look like
POD1000000048_S0000103	but we do not yet have anything super actionable so i think the situation is a bit analogous to where ai safety was a few years ago
POD1000000048_S0000104	where there was starting to be an articulation of what the problem was with the book superintelligence and various other publications
POD1000000048_S0000105	and people were starting to take the problem seriously and started to have a vocabulary for what a solution would look like with value alignment and other terms being coined
POD1000000048_S0000106	but there was not yet any concrete research agenda subsequently there have been a lot of concrete research agendas as
POD1000000048_S0000107	well as technical progress on some parts of those research agendas with work by openai and deepmind and others leading the way
POD1000000048_S0000108	so i think that we are potentially in a similarly exciting phase on the ai policy front where we have a decent understanding of what the problem is and with the example of avoiding arms races being forefront in my mind
POD1000000048_S0000109	at least but we do not yet have a concrete we do not have you know clear models and case studies that we can point to as ways forwards
POD1000000048_S0000110	so i think that is the next step is moving into more concrete proposals and trying to balance some of the trade offs that have been identified in recent papers
POD1000000048_S0000112	so it seems like a lot of the latest thinking in this area is not written up in public yet partly because people do not want to publicize their views at this point or just because it takes a long time to get papers published
POD1000000048_S0000113	what do you think is the best way for someone who is interested in working in the area to get up to speed on the issues
POD1000000048_S0000114	so i think again it is somewhat analogous to the situation with ai safety a few years ago and i think the book superintelligence was a big step forward on that front in terms of having a single reference to point people to ai
POD1000000048_S0000115	but it is less clear if there is one single reference to point people to on ai policy issues though i am hoping that the career guide that i am working on will be somewhat useful in that regard
POD1000000048_S0000116	another resource that comes to mind is a syllabus for a class on the global politics of ai developed by alan defoe at yale and the future of humanity institute
POD1000000048_S0000117	so that is a very detailed list of resources and i am sure there will be a link provided for this interview somewhere
POD1000000048_S0000118	yeah
POD1000000048_S0000119	and yeah so i think that is another set of resources so it is essentially a long list of both formal academic publications as well as things in the more gray literature
POD1000000048_S0000120	such as blog posts which is you know i think the sort of thing you are referring to is you know things that are not necessarily written up academically but are you know somewhat accessible but even there there is still some things like you know google docs that are used internally and so forth
POD1000000048_S0000121	so i think if based on reading those sorts of things this is clearly something you are interested in then the obvious next step is just to get in touch with people who are working on these issues and ask and indicate what your interests are
POD1000000048_S0000122	there might be things that are not available online that they can point you to
POD1000000048_S0000123	yeah you mentioned the asilomar statement of principles do you just want to describe that
POD1000000048_S0000124	sure so .
POD1000000048_S0000125	2 years ago there was a conference on beneficial ai held in puerto rico and that led to an open letter on ai
POD1000000048_S0000126	and subsequently some investment by elon musk and the future of life institute which supported a lot of grants in this space
POD1000000048_S0000127	and i think that that led to a lot of attention to the issue and there were 1000s of people including a lot of ai scientists who signed on to that letter
POD1000000048_S0000128	then subsequently the asilomar ai principles which were developed at a conference 2 years later this year at asilomar in california
POD1000000048_S0000129	developed a more specific set of proposals for what sorts of things ai scientists should be thinking about so not just you know the fact that there should be more research but also things like capability cautions
POD1000000048_S0000130	so being attentive to the fact that we do not know for sure what the upper limits of ai capabilities will ultimately be
POD1000000048_S0000131	and the things i mentioned about avoiding arms races and being concerned about ai weaponization more broadly i think that is a good example of developing a consensus view on what
POD1000000048_S0000132	what we want to see and what we do not want to see we want to see ai benefiting society as a whole and we do not want to see it leading to the accruing of benefits to a small number of people or to a large scale war or anything like that
POD1000000048_S0000133	and i think it is encouraging to see not just that but also the development of other sets of principles through the ieee and their effort on ethically aligned ai design
POD1000000048_S0000134	so i read those principles and they seemed quite strong on paper do you think people are likely to follow through on them
POD1000000048_S0000135	i think there is somewhat of a gap between the level of abstraction of the principles and concrete steps that people can take
POD1000000048_S0000136	so for example it is not totally clear what any individual can do to stop an arms race for example but i think it is a step in the right direction to know where you are headed and
POD1000000048_S0000137	and then figuring out exactly what to do about that is the next step
POD1000000048_S0000138	yeah so in your guide you suggest that people could potentially work on ai strategy and policy questions at places like google deepmind or openai where artificial intelligence is actually being developed
POD1000000048_S0000139	what concretely could you see people doing at places like that if they took a job there
POD1000000048_S0000140	yeah so to some extent people at those organizations are doing something fairly similar to what i and my colleagues are doing in academia which is
POD1000000048_S0000141	which is thinking about what the problems are and trying to develop solutions i think the benefit of being on that side of things is to have more direct exposure to what is happening on the ground so to speak
POD1000000048_S0000142	in ai development and i think that can be useful for developing a set of what sorts of problems are actually cropping up as a result of the development of capabilities that actually exist as opposed to just ones in the future
POD1000000048_S0000143	though i think it is also notable that people at these organizations have been very active in the efforts that i have mentioned such as raising attention to ai safety
POD1000000048_S0000144	which was an initiative that involved people at google brain and openai and the concrete problems and ai safety paper
POD1000000048_S0000145	and people at deepmind have been very influential in calling for more ai safety work and they have been publishing fairly early on this matter relative to other organizations
POD1000000048_S0000146	so i think there is a lot of reason to think that these organizations are playing a positive role and i think it would be a good place to be involved in sort of thought leadership on these topics
POD1000000048_S0000147	as well as doing direct research
POD1000000048_S0000149	and how hard is it to get a job at a place like that
POD1000000048_S0000151	i would imagine they would only have a few people working on ai strategy or policy are these extremely competitive roles
POD1000000048_S0000152	i would say they are pretty competitive and i think that is you know a general phenomenon in anything related to ai these days you know whether on the policy side or the technical side
POD1000000048_S0000153	but i think that this is a growth area for sure so if one develops expertise in this topic and has something to contribute
POD1000000048_S0000154	then i think there will ultimately be opportunities available to you in the next few years
POD1000000048_S0000155	again i want to draw an analogy to ai safety where there was a lot of concern about will there be jobs in ai safety 3 years or so ago and i think that deterred some grad students from working in this space
POD1000000048_S0000156	now the situation seems to look a bit better in that there is a fair number of advertisements for postdocs and people being hired at top labs to work on these issues
POD1000000048_S0000157	so i think we will probably see something pretty similar not necessarily it becoming not competitive but there being a little bit of slackening over time as there is a need for developing larger teams to work on these topics
POD1000000048_S0000159	and another path you have talked about is going into politics or policy roles for example as a congressional staffer or perhaps at a think tank like the brookings institute or the national science foundation or potentially just going into party politics in general
POD1000000048_S0000160	what useful things do you envisage people could do there
POD1000000048_S0000162	yes i think in the same way that working at an ai lab would give you a better sense of what is practical on the technical front
POD1000000048_S0000163	working for congress or parliament or a political party would give you a better sense of what is practical on the political front
POD1000000048_S0000164	so in addition to that developing a better intuition for the system that you are dealing with and what the constraints are
POD1000000048_S0000165	i think it is also potentially a good way to actually influence what is actually done by those bodies
POD1000000048_S0000166	so for example in the u s congress right now there was just recently announced an ai caucus to organize the discussion of members of congress on issues related to ai
POD1000000048_S0000167	with particular focus on issues related to the future of work but i think over time we will see more discussion of the longer term sorts of issues
POD1000000048_S0000168	that we have been talking about in those fora and it would be useful to have people who are concerned about making sure that the right thing is ultimately done working in those places
POD1000000048_S0000169	able to actually act on the best current understanding developed by researchers and by practitioners
POD1000000048_S0000170	yeah so i think a big risk of going into politics or policy in general would be that your career progresses but you are not specifically in one of the places that ends up having a say in how these things go
POD1000000048_S0000171	you just end up working in a congressional committee that turns out not to be that relevant are there any roles that you can take early on or what can you do to position yourself well so that you do not just get sidelined in the end
POD1000000048_S0000173	i think if you intend to work in politics then you have to be somewhat opportunistic about jobs and the ebb and flow of political opportunities so for example
POD1000000048_S0000174	if you know one congressional committee is declining in its relevance in terms of ai then one should consider about you know jumping ship towards somewhere that is more relevant
POD1000000048_S0000175	so i do not think that taking one particular job will lock you in forever but building up some political capital and some human capital in that area could be useful there
POD1000000048_S0000176	even if you ultimately want to switch to a different organization but i would push back a little bit on the idea of not being relevant just because you are not on the side of people
POD1000000048_S0000177	you are not at the organization where people are developing the latest ai i mean as i mentioned before i think that is a very exciting opportunity and you know along with academia it is a great place to work on these issues
POD1000000048_S0000178	but governments still play an important role in framing these issues and in convening discussions
POD1000000048_S0000179	so an example of this would be the preparing for the future of artificial intelligence report put out by the white house office of science and technology policy last year
POD1000000048_S0000180	which was the result of 4 workshops that brought together experts in a wide variety of areas in law and economics and ai technology and safety
POD1000000048_S0000181	and so i think you still have an opportunity to frame the discussion and move the ball forward even if you are not working in the latest labs
POD1000000048_S0000182	yeah so what would be some of the best places to apply to in that area
POD1000000048_S0000183	so it is a bit tricky to answer that in general it depends on factors like what your citizenship is and what particular policy issues you are interested in
POD1000000048_S0000184	but some fairly robust recommendations would be to look for a particular class of people that have technical backgrounds
POD1000000048_S0000185	one area to look at would be aaas fellowships so the american association for the advancement of science has a fellowship program
POD1000000048_S0000186	where they essentially put people in rotations in organizations like congress and the executive branch where they can implement some of they can draw on their technical experience
POD1000000048_S0000187	and someone with a background in ai would probably end up in an ai relevant organization so i have heard a lot of good things about that being a good way to develop career capital and experience and understanding of how the political system works
POD1000000048_S0000188	but that is not necessarily going to result in being in the exact right location for solving ai policy problems the next few months
POD1000000048_S0000189	i think it is really hard to say where that would be or even if there is such a place because i think we are still
POD1000000048_S0000190	despite all the progress that is being made in a relatively early stage there is not even yet a nomination for the director of the office of science and technology policy in the white house
POD1000000048_S0000191	so otherwise i would say that that is a good place to go so and likewise we do not really know what the agenda of the trump administration is on the ai front
POD1000000048_S0000192	and there is a lot of discussion but not much institution building in governments at the moment so it is hard for me to answer that in general
POD1000000048_S0000193	but i think getting experience is a pretty robust thing to do
POD1000000048_S0000194	right right so a situation that i encounter reasonably often is i meet someone who is really smart who is very interested in this topic who might be able to make a great contribution
POD1000000048_S0000195	but at the moment there are not that many groups that are hiring for these roles so you are at the future of humanity institute and i guess there is also the future of life institute but there are not that many places that someone can potentially apply
POD1000000048_S0000196	so i am thinking what advice should i give someone in that situation should they continue studying perhaps or building expertise so that they are in a better position to apply in future when the number of positions grows or yeah
POD1000000048_S0000197	yeah i mean again it is hard to answer that in general it depends on what what
POD1000000048_S0000198	background the person has and what sorts of jobs are interested in but i think if one casts a fairly large net in terms of what ai issues one wants to work on there is a fairly large range of organizations
POD1000000048_S0000199	it is not just fhi there is also the center for the study of existential risk the leverhulme center for the future of intelligence the tech policy lab at the university of washington
POD1000000048_S0000200	and various academic programs around the country in the us and around the world are looking to hire people
POD1000000048_S0000201	for example as postdocs or faculty member in areas related to ai and policy if you are someone with an academic background
POD1000000048_S0000202	and there are probably a fair number of policy positions at tech companies that are not necessarily specific to ai but that would lead to getting valuable experience in the broad area of tech policies
POD1000000048_S0000203	so again one i guess to generalize a bit i would recommend casting a fairly large net and working in adjacent areas if you can not immediately work in the exact right place
POD1000000048_S0000204	because this is not the sort of area where people have been working on ai policy for decades and it is hard to break in for that reason it is more just that it is still a field that is growing
POD1000000048_S0000205	and i do not think that that growth will stop i think there will be more opportunities in the future but if you can not find the right opportunity now
POD1000000048_S0000206	then you know again talk to people in the field about what sorts of opportunities are on the horizon and try and work in adjacent fields that might be one thing to consider
POD1000000048_S0000207	yeah so what do you think would be the biggest challenges for someone sitting out trying to start a career in this area
POD1000000048_S0000208	depending on one is background i think the main challenge would be boning up on areas of weakness
POD1000000048_S0000209	for example if you have a policy background you might want to focus on learning more about ai if you have a technical background you might want to focus more on learning about policy
POD1000000048_S0000210	i think one of the challenges is what you mentioned before about there not being a super clearly accessible literature on the topic
POD1000000048_S0000211	again i think there is some effort going into addressing that with a career guide and the bibliography that i mentioned
POD1000000048_S0000212	but i am not really sure that there is any specific set of pitfalls that i would recommend that
POD1000000048_S0000213	people avoid besides not neglecting the areas in which they are weak do not try and rest on your laurels and say technical areas or policy areas because it is fairly interdisciplinary area
POD1000000048_S0000214	and you would need to think about what sorts of disciplinary perspectives would be beneficial to solving the problem you are interested in and not just what is your background though of course you want to draw on your strengths
POD1000000048_S0000215	i guess because it is a field that is at its fairly early stages and is growing quickly
POD1000000048_S0000216	it would be a good fit for someone who was really able to set their own direction and meet people and potentially attract funding to do what they want to do someone who is going to create the opportunities that they want to go into
POD1000000048_S0000217	yeah absolutely and i yeah it is it is an area that is evolving and i think a lot a lot of the organizations
POD1000000048_S0000218	that exist today and i have mentioned as good places to work and so forth did not exist 5 years ago so
POD1000000048_S0000220	yeah some of them did not exist one year ago so it is an area in flux and i think as with politics
POD1000000048_S0000221	you should be opportunistic about thinking about what is the right place for you to be in
POD1000000048_S0000222	but yeah i think it is a very exciting area to work in and i think that a lot of people will find that it is an area that would benefit from their background
POD1000000048_S0000223	so if you had someone who could go into any kind of organizational role and that would be a good fit for it what kind of person would you think is most valuable out of everything
POD1000000048_S0000225	most valuable person i do not really have an answer for that
POD1000000048_S0000226	do not have an answer to that
POD1000000048_S0000227	yeah
POD1000000048_S0000228	is there any say vacancy out there that you think you know you just wish that someone could fill it
POD1000000048_S0000229	.
POD1000000048_S0000231	i mean one vacancy that comes to mind is for the policy researcher position at deepmind so they are currently hiring for someone to specifically look at ai policy
POD1000000048_S0000232	so i think the case is pretty clear that that would be a good place to work and a good role to have if you are interested in influencing the conversation around ai policy and being exposed to the latest developments
POD1000000048_S0000233	so yeah if you are if you would be a good candidate for that then and you are interested in that you should definitely apply
POD1000000048_S0000234	so sometimes i find people who want to work on ai policy because they do not see themselves as quite cut out for technical research perhaps because their math skills are not quite good enough
POD1000000048_S0000235	is that a sensible way to go or is in some ways the ai strategy work harder just because it is less clear it is less precise than technical work
POD1000000048_S0000236	i would not say it is harder or easier it is just different but even on the technical side there is a lot of fuzziness
POD1000000048_S0000237	so you know ai safety was not very crisply defined a few years ago and it is starting to move more in the direction of technical rigor
POD1000000048_S0000238	and i think the same thing will happen to ai policy to some extent but there will also always be some element of relationship building and qualitative analysis and so forth
POD1000000048_S0000239	that certainly is not exactly the same as solving technical problems so yes i do think that having a different background it would make sense to choose different areas to work based on your background
POD1000000048_S0000240	but i would not say that you know working on the safety problem is totally technical and the policy problem is totally non technical but certainly there is some correlation there
POD1000000048_S0000241	and what kind of level of technical understanding do you have to get to in order to be able to make a useful contribution
POD1000000048_S0000242	i am not sure that you need any specific level in order to make some contribution so for example there are a lot of roles that could be played by people who are just good at distilling the literature on a particular topic
POD1000000048_S0000243	so for example if we are interested in understanding the role that ai could play in authoritarian states
POD1000000048_S0000244	and you do not necessarily have to have any technical background to read up on the literature around surveillance and coercion and things like that
POD1000000048_S0000245	so i think there is a lot of room for just good synthesizers and people who are curious and interested to dip into areas they are unfamiliar with
POD1000000048_S0000246	but i think there is also a fairly high ceiling for what would be useful
POD1000000048_S0000247	so i think it would also be good to have people with very strong technical backgrounds thinking about the nitty gritty game theory issues related to arms races and so forth
POD1000000048_S0000248	so i think it is a pretty broad range of possible skill sets that would be useful
POD1000000048_S0000249	right so you are thinking if you can just understand what you can speculate about what an ai might be capable of doing in the future and then say if you know economics or if you know social science
POD1000000048_S0000250	and you can think well what implications would that have for politics and that kind of thing even if you do not understand specifically how the ai would work
POD1000000048_S0000251	yeah i mean ideally you would know a little bit about each of those things but you do not need to be an expert in everything it is impossible to be an expert in everything
POD1000000048_S0000252	so it is not feasible to learn about every single discipline of which i will list several in this policy career guide that you mentioned
POD1000000048_S0000253	clearly you cannot be an expert a deep expert in technical ai economics sociology political science etc
POD1000000048_S0000254	but knowing a little bit and being able to collaborate with people with complementary skill sets is also very valuable
POD1000000048_S0000255	so i think a lot of the most exciting work in the next few years will involve collaboration between people on the technical side and on the policy side
POD1000000048_S0000256	right so how can someone tell which kind of paths they are most suited for
POD1000000048_S0000258	i do not think that there is any clear algorithm for this but talking to people in the area and reading some of the literature and thinking about where you think the gaps are
POD1000000048_S0000259	what areas you think that you could shed light on given your background is definitely something you should do
POD1000000048_S0000260	you should look at what sorts of job opportunities are available and cast a fairly broad net because you do not necessarily know what is going to strike your interest until you stumble upon that opportunity
POD1000000048_S0000261	and networking is also super helpful so i think you know not just in terms of finding out about job opportunities and figuring out where there is a nice fit but also finding out about different organizational cultures and where you might fit in is also useful
POD1000000048_S0000262	so yeah i do not think there is a single algorithm but networking and reading more of the literature and looking at job postings are all good things to do
POD1000000048_S0000263	what kinds of places can people network are there any events that are open to people who do not yet have roles
POD1000000048_S0000264	yeah so all of the ai conferences are open to anyone who is capable of paying for the trip and the ticket
POD1000000048_S0000265	so some examples of big ai conferences are nips icml
POD1000000048_S0000267	triple ai and so forth
POD1000000048_S0000268	nips is probably the biggest machine learning conference right now with an emphasis on deep learning icml is also a very large one actually i am not sure which one of those is bigger
POD1000000048_S0000269	i have not been to icml but i have been to nips a few times and iclear iclr is also a deep learning specific conference
POD1000000048_S0000270	so i think going to conferences like that and specifically going to workshops and symposia that are relevant to policy questions which often happens at these conferences
POD1000000048_S0000271	so for example at nips last year there was there was a symposium on ai and the law so they are
POD1000000048_S0000272	there are opportunities like that to network and to find out more about how people in that area are thinking and to meet people who have similar interests
POD1000000048_S0000273	and that is just on the ai side it is also worth thinking about more policy oriented conferences so there is some conferences like the governance of emerging technologies conference
POD1000000048_S0000274	the we robot conference series and probably a few others that would be of interest to people who are either on the technical side want to move into more thinking about policy side
POD1000000048_S0000275	or just they are in the policy side but they want to specifically seek out people interested in ai those would be good places to look
POD1000000048_S0000276	and are any of the organizations involved open enough that someone who is interested in the area can drop by and get to know people
POD1000000048_S0000277	yeah so i think particularly on the academic side though to some extent also at corporations there is a fair amount of openness
POD1000000048_S0000278	and you know for example at fhi we host a lot of visitors who just want to learn more about our work and the same is true of other organizations
POD1000000048_S0000280	yeah so it sounded like in your guide you thought that the best undergraduate major was something like combining a technical subject
POD1000000048_S0000281	like maths or computer science with more social science topic like politics or economics
POD1000000048_S0000282	assuming that most people listening to this have already chosen their major what should people do at the postgraduate level should they do a phd or just go and work directly at google if they can
POD1000000048_S0000284	i .
POD1000000048_S0000286	i mean i have probably said this a 10 times but i do not think there is a clear answer for everyone
POD1000000048_S0000288	but certainly you know it does not hurt to have an advanced degree of course there are opportunity costs but there are certainly more job opportunities available for someone who you know has a ph d
POD1000000048_S0000289	so for example i do not know if it is a hard requirement certainly but certainly it would be a benefit for people applying to a fair number of industry jobs if they had an advanced degree
POD1000000048_S0000290	as well as in academia so i mean it is hard to avoid the fact that you know for academic jobs as much as you know we would like to you know hire people solely based on you know their demonstrated skill it is
POD1000000048_S0000291	often also the case that there are university policies surrounding what sorts of degrees you need for different roles and pay grades and so forth so
POD1000000048_S0000292	there is definitely value to having a graduate degree despite the non trivial opportunity costs if you have an opportunity
POD1000000048_S0000293	but as with all of these things it depends on someone is background and if you have a clear opportunity to make an impact
POD1000000048_S0000294	and you could you know perhaps get some of the best of both worlds by you know also taking classes online or enrolling at a local university and being a part time phd student or a master is student i think
POD1000000048_S0000295	there might be ways to have your cake and eat it too but it would depend on the particular person
POD1000000048_S0000296	yeah and i guess the most obvious options at the postgraduate level are things like machine learning or computer science or economics or i guess public policy is that useful
POD1000000048_S0000297	yeah so at you know just to give a particular example at oxford we have a handful of people who are interested in ai safety and ai policy as well as you know broader issues related to the future
POD1000000048_S0000298	and just at the organization that i am at fhi there are people who are either currently enrolled or will soon be enrolled in programs in mine which is human and social dimensions of science and technology
POD1000000048_S0000299	as well as machine learning cybersecurity and zoology so there is a wide range of possible areas that one could study and find an advisor that is suitable and interested in supporting interesting work
POD1000000048_S0000301	yeah so some people worry that doing work in this area could be harmful if not done well for example it could be that as you were saying earlier that regulation in this area could be done poorly and would actually be harmful overall
POD1000000048_S0000302	or that bringing greater attention to the issue could reinforce the arms race dynamic alternatively having people get involved who do not have enough technical expertise could bring the area into dispute
POD1000000048_S0000303	how seriously do you take those kinds of concerns should people be cautious about jumping into the area if they do not feel like they are really on top of things
POD1000000048_S0000304	i .
POD1000000048_S0000306	i think that it is a reasonable concern and there is
POD1000000048_S0000307	in fact some risk of discrediting yourself or your cause by being too alarmist or whatever the particular charge might be
POD1000000048_S0000308	but on the other hand there is a lot of noise in the system no matter what and whatever you do in the near term there will be terminator pictures and people who dismiss ai safety and all sorts of other things you can not really control
POD1000000048_S0000309	so i think there are also risks of not acting which is you know not you know not being able to help out when you know there is an important problem and you have something to contribute
POD1000000048_S0000310	i would say you know if that is something that concerns you then talk to people about you know your beliefs and what their beliefs are and you know
POD1000000048_S0000311	whether there is and look at surveys of experts and see what the reasonable distribution is among people who have studied the topic more
POD1000000048_S0000312	so i do not think it is you know an all or nothing sort of thing where you either have to stay ignorant or you know be a super expert
POD1000000048_S0000313	i think there is a middle ground where you sort of develop your confidence little by little as you go and try and remain as modest as possible in areas that you have little expertise
POD1000000048_S0000314	yeah and i suppose you can always just track the things that people like you or nick bostrom are saying and how you speak about the issue so that you do not come across as alarmist and you have a measured and precise tone
POD1000000048_S0000315	right
POD1000000048_S0000316	yeah so you mentioned earlier that ai could potentially be used in military applications and that is one way that things could go badly given that do you see much value in people going into military or intelligence roles with the hope of limiting this in the future
POD1000000048_S0000318	possibly it is really hard to say it would depend on the particular role so probably a role higher up in the chain and more on the policy and strategy sides of things
POD1000000048_S0000319	as opposed to the more operational or logistical or just execution side of things would be more likely to give you an opportunity to affect those sorts of things
POD1000000048_S0000320	but there might also be benefits to that beyond just having a direct impact on the issue while in that role
POD1000000048_S0000321	you can also develop valuable connections and know the right people to influence from the outside down the road or have a better understanding of the dynamics of the problem and what needs to be done to solve it
POD1000000048_S0000322	i definitely would not dismiss it but i also would not necessarily recommend it across the board as the best thing to do
POD1000000048_S0000323	yeah i guess the intelligence services and the military are just such enormous bureaucracies i suppose i would worry that someone it is just unlikely perhaps that you would be in the right place at the right time or have enough discretion in those roles to be able to make a difference
POD1000000048_S0000324	but as you say it could help you to build up your career capital so you can get other useful roles in future and you know how the system works so you can potentially influence it from outside and talk to the right people
POD1000000048_S0000325	yeah exactly so you know again it would depend on the particular person and what other options they have but it is certainly worth considering
POD1000000048_S0000326	what about foreign policy could it be useful to go into the department of state or something like that and work on arms control agreements
POD1000000048_S0000327	or even just current arms control agreements so that you understand how they work and can think about how they might work for ai in future
POD1000000048_S0000329	yeah so i think that could be very useful looking at arms control and foreign policy both from an academic perspective and from a practitioner perspective i think it is very valuable
POD1000000048_S0000330	and it is something that is not our strong suit in the ai safety and policy community right now
POD1000000048_S0000331	so you know more could be done on that front but i think you know some of the same caveats apply to the as to the military and intelligence side of things that the state department for example is a very large bureaucracy
POD1000000048_S0000332	yeah and how do you feel about just more general attempts to make the world better such that when ai is developed things are more likely to go well
POD1000000048_S0000333	for example just improving the quality of government in general trying to get the right kinds of people elected or improving our ability to forecast the future across the board
POD1000000048_S0000335	i guess one worry would be that that is just not sufficiently leveraged on this specific problem and if you think ai is really likely to be the key issue then you want to work on that specifically
POD1000000048_S0000336	but maybe if you can improve our ability to forecast technological changes in future across the board then that could be a better option and also you just have a lot more options if you are open to broader ways of improving the world
POD1000000048_S0000337	yeah i do not think there is a clear decision for everyone but both at the group level and at the individual level it often makes sense to take somewhat of a portfolio approach
POD1000000048_S0000338	so there are people at fhi who also are affiliated with the center for effective altruism and involved in building the ea community like owen cotton barrett and toby ord
POD1000000048_S0000339	so there are people who straddle that boundary and look for opportunities to benefit both sides and there are also people who focus on one thing or the other
POD1000000048_S0000340	so i do not think there is a clear right answer but certainly the sorts of trade offs you mentioned sound reasonable like on the one hand one would want the world to be in a better place
POD1000000048_S0000341	for there to be more people who are thinking carefully about making good decisions and benefiting the future people in various important decision making roles
POD1000000048_S0000342	but there it is quite uncertain you know what what impact you could have on ai and likewise even even if you work directly on ai it is not totally clear that that is always the best thing you should do
POD1000000048_S0000343	but i have a slight bias towards thinking that direct work needs more attention at the moment but i think you should take that with a grain of salt
POD1000000048_S0000344	because i would like more people to help solve the specific problems i am working on
POD1000000048_S0000345	so we should potentially continue trying to get people involved should not we all just become ai researchers right away
POD1000000048_S0000346	right
POD1000000048_S0000347	so that is all of my questions was there anything you wanted to add
POD1000000048_S0000348	any inspiring message
POD1000000048_S0000349	yeah i mean i will just sort of circle back on what i was saying earlier which is that ai safety was in a very nebulous stage of development a few years ago
POD1000000048_S0000350	and it took the work of nick bostrom and super intelligence and stuart russell and giving a lot of talks and writing op eds to call more attention to it and give it more legitimacy
POD1000000048_S0000351	and then subsequent work was done to refine the issue and develop research agendas by people including the authors of the concrete problems and ai safety paper
POD1000000048_S0000352	now we have a lot of postdocs and graduate students working specifically on this we have people in industry specifically working on well defined problems in this space
POD1000000048_S0000353	and we have the opportunity to make a similar transition in ai policy over the next few years
POD1000000048_S0000354	who are removed from fairly high level desiderata and problem framings to specific proposals and you know formal models and you know good white papers
POD1000000048_S0000355	and so forth over the next few years and it is an area that would benefit from a lot of people is expertise so i would definitely encourage people who think they might have some relevant expertise to seriously consider it
POD1000000048_S0000356	yeah i will just reiterate that since i wrote our problem profile on positively shaping artificial development we have heard from a lot of people who think that this is the most neglected area within ai safety
POD1000000048_S0000357	and i am very keen to get more people working on these problems and getting more organizations hiring for them so if it is something that you are interested in
POD1000000048_S0000358	i think you should definitely be looking into it more and we will put up links to guides where you can find out more and meet the right people
POD1000000048_S0000360	yeah thanks so much have a great day and look forward to talking in future
POD1000000048_S0000361	all right thanks bye
YOU1000000000_S0000000	on this week is episode we drive the new ford ranger we answer questions about evs and driving in cold weather
YOU1000000000_S0000001	and also answer the question what do we do with the cars once we are done testing them next on talking cars
YOU1000000000_S0000003	hi and welcome back i am mike quincy
YOU1000000000_S0000005	so we like to give a little behind the scenes look at what goes on here at consumer parts auto test track
YOU1000000000_S0000006	we talk to people who are die hard enthusiasts as well as people that look upon cars as merely appliances
YOU1000000000_S0000007	and we find that they are absolutely shocked when they find out that we buy every test car
YOU1000000000_S0000008	that we put through our test program and that for testing purposes we drive a different car every night
YOU1000000000_S0000009	so to take us through the process ryan how do you decide what do you drive every night
YOU1000000000_S0000010	well before that you know your routine we buy all these cars anonymously
YOU1000000000_S0000011	we bring them back here we check them in we have a wall of keys and it is like fantasyland right
YOU1000000000_S0000012	and we get to pick these cars every night almost every single night we drive a different car that is pretty ridiculous right
YOU1000000000_S0000013	so there is the wall of keys we pick what we are going to drive
YOU1000000000_S0000014	and some of these cars if it is a brand new car it has a priority we have to get it up to miles we have to get it up to 2000 miles before we can test it
YOU1000000000_S0000015	and there is people that are writing 1st drives or the engineers people that have a direct influence on the early testing
YOU1000000000_S0000016	have to get in these cars 1st
YOU1000000000_S0000017	they are video producers that get on us for doing a 1st drive video
YOU1000000000_S0000018	always bothering us to do more of that
YOU1000000000_S0000019	so there is some sort of a i do not want to call it a pecking order
YOU1000000000_S0000020	you know there is there is priorities people need to get in these cars and we all understand that and
YOU1000000000_S0000021	and make way for that and once they are done testing them
YOU1000000000_S0000022	they go to another wall and that wall that is the huge wall yeah this wall is all like the retirees right
YOU1000000000_S0000024	this is where it gets interesting though
YOU1000000000_S0000025	because the 1st keyboard is cars that they have to all get miles there we are driving them irregardless when they move to the other board now it is selective
YOU1000000000_S0000026	and that is when you get to see the favorites
YOU1000000000_S0000027	yeah you get to see the cars that people really actually like and the cars that after testing people are like eh
YOU1000000000_S0000028	no i am not going to drive that anymore
YOU1000000000_S0000029	yeah so it is kind of interesting because some of these cars it is winter auto start
YOU1000000000_S0000030	heated seats they are clear winners suvs i mean i go up to vermont and do stuff i always have an suv
YOU1000000000_S0000031	something with all wheel drive
YOU1000000000_S0000032	yeah i will go drive you are into boats you have got trailers to tow and stuff like that right yeah
YOU1000000000_S0000033	that brings us around to the springtime which we are hoping for that it comes anytime soon
YOU1000000000_S0000034	but the most frequently asked question that i know i get asked probably you guys too
YOU1000000000_S0000035	is what do you do with the cars once you are done testing them right
YOU1000000000_S0000036	so we sell the cars when we are done so the 1st thing we do is a company wide email goes out
YOU1000000000_S0000037	to let all the employees know what cars we are currently selling what the selling price how many miles are on them
YOU1000000000_S0000038	and the cars that are not sold to employees then they typically go to auction
YOU1000000000_S0000039	we sell them there and then we take that money to buy more test cars and usually these cars have anywhere from 6000 to 12000 miles on them when we are done testing
YOU1000000000_S0000040	some have more we keep some longer than others like let us say it has maybe some advanced safety features that we want to do more testing with
YOU1000000000_S0000041	or maybe there is a direct competitor of this car coming soon we want to keep this current car in our test fleet
YOU1000000000_S0000042	so that we have some really good back to back comparisons
YOU1000000000_S0000043	and so considering what we have on hand right now so mike what is kind of a go to car that you find yourself signing up for
YOU1000000000_S0000044	so i actually have a few go to cars i mean one of them is the hyundai veloster turbo
YOU1000000000_S0000045	the only one we have in the manual
YOU1000000000_S0000046	it is the only car we currently have with a manual transmission it has really great handling really nice 6 speed manual shifter
YOU1000000000_S0000047	i actually do not go to it quite as much right now because it is quite cold it has summer tires summer tires do not work as well in the winter
YOU1000000000_S0000048	but when it is a warm ish day i will take it and it just kind of goes to show how important a manual transmission is
YOU1000000000_S0000049	because i actually do not even really love that car it rides pretty stiff
YOU1000000000_S0000050	and it is not like it has tons of power and it is front wheel drive i am not a fan of front wheel drive performance cars
YOU1000000000_S0000051	but it shows how much i love driving manual transmission i will drive that car any chance i get
YOU1000000000_S0000052	but other cars that i go to genesis g 70 it is like a nicer kia stinger i love that
YOU1000000000_S0000053	bmw x 5 i mean it is a fantastic suv it is just great in every way smooth comfortable nice powertrain the x 5 is a little bit more of a power
YOU1000000000_S0000054	that is why it does not get cold
YOU1000000000_S0000055	no that thing yeah that will be yeah the keys are never available and then the ram 1500 because that is it is my favorite pickup truck i love pickup trucks
YOU1000000000_S0000056	it is so capable yet drives almost like a car and it has a great sounding v 8
YOU1000000000_S0000057	so those are my go tos
YOU1000000000_S0000058	and so ryan when you can choose what do you find
YOU1000000000_S0000059	like i said earlier it is winter i have been going up north a bunch i use the x 5 a lot
YOU1000000000_S0000060	i like the silverado you mentioned the veloster
YOU1000000000_S0000061	i do not fit in it that well it is fun to drive but there is just times when i am like it is just frustrating because i do not fit in it that well
YOU1000000000_S0000062	i find myself as i have mentioned before i go through suv fatigue
YOU1000000000_S0000063	i just sometimes get tired of it i miss cars yeah and i find myself signing out the nissan altima
YOU1000000000_S0000064	over and over it has got heated seats it has got a decent ride it has android auto so i have got a map
YOU1000000000_S0000065	i have got my music it is just an easy car to live with i mean it definitely has its faults as we found in our testing
YOU1000000000_S0000066	but i just i am comfortable in my car i do not know how else to put it
YOU1000000000_S0000067	and no one is fighting you for the keys
YOU1000000000_S0000068	and no one is fighting me through the keys
YOU1000000000_S0000069	but like you guys i mean i am gravitating toward pickup trucks all the time these are test vehicles
YOU1000000000_S0000070	we take them to home depot we go to the garden centers we use them to work all the time
YOU1000000000_S0000071	and i also am with you on the ram and the silverado both great trucks
YOU1000000000_S0000072	which kind of brings us to our next topic of what we are driving this week at the track
YOU1000000000_S0000073	and so since clearly pickup trucks are big these days we have our new 2019 ford ranger
YOU1000000000_S0000074	this was hotly anticipated by those of us that love pickups so mike if you could give us a quick rundown of the ranger and how it got here
YOU1000000000_S0000075	yeah so the ranger was 1st sold in the us in 1982 and it was sold here until the 2011 model year
YOU1000000000_S0000076	and sales were strong you know for a while when that pickup was 1st came out but like in the mid 2000s sales started going down
YOU1000000000_S0000077	pretty dramatically and so you know that was a joint project the ranger between mazda they had the b series pickup
YOU1000000000_S0000078	that was basically you know almost identical to the ranger
YOU1000000000_S0000079	so ford and mazda looked at it and was like well is it worth with sales going down so much is it worth investing the money
YOU1000000000_S0000080	to totally redesign the truck because by 2011 that thing was really old it was an aging truck
YOU1000000000_S0000081	and so they decided to not have the truck here anymore
YOU1000000000_S0000082	and then the market was basically this compact or mid sized pickup segment it was largely dominated by the toyota tacoma has been for a long time
YOU1000000000_S0000083	but the nissan frontier kept in there but those you know the tacoma especially is quite an old design as well
YOU1000000000_S0000084	then chevy with their colorado and gmc with the twin the canyon
YOU1000000000_S0000085	you know redesign their pickups and i think ford looked at it like ok hold it we have a ranger that is sold in other markets
YOU1000000000_S0000086	this and you know the ridgeline was redesigned came back was redesigned jeep gladiators coming out and
YOU1000000000_S0000087	i think they said we got to get back in this market because pickups are still hot in this country
YOU1000000000_S0000088	and so they have this existing design sold elsewhere
YOU1000000000_S0000089	they brought it back here and that is where we are now with this 2019 ford ranger
YOU1000000000_S0000090	and not everyone needs a 1500 a half ton pickup truck
YOU1000000000_S0000091	for a lot of people are small i mean i need a 3500 dually diesel but that is just me that is just me you need a step ladder to get up in it
YOU1000000000_S0000092	come on another short joke they have running boards i have a hard time with this segment because this truck the ranger we had was about $40000
YOU1000000000_S0000094	you can get a full size truck for a little more money right and i personally i think it is crazy because i do not fit in these trucks as well
YOU1000000000_S0000095	and it is half the truck i mean it does not make sense to me for that kind of money if you are space conscious and you want a smaller vehicle it makes some sense but beyond that
YOU1000000000_S0000096	and i posted on consumer reports facebook page a picture of the new ranger
YOU1000000000_S0000097	why do not we spend $40000 +and almost every comment was $40000 plus
YOU1000000000_S0000098	it is a lot of money for them
YOU1000000000_S0000099	so we try to outfit the trucks a certain way all cars we try to outfit the way we think most people are going to the way the truck is going to be sold so that is why right now that truck is $40000
YOU1000000000_S0000101	our current full size trucks right now are ending up at about $50000 so for $10000 more you are going to have a really nice full size truck not a stripper but a stripper but the prices are always going down
YOU1000000000_S0000102	that is what i mean you could know yeah no yeah but anyway either way i drove it yeah i was going to say how does it drive i drove it last night and i was pleased actually
YOU1000000000_S0000103	because i went into it like the tacoma i do not care for the tacoma the tacoma is great but i do not fit in it well
YOU1000000000_S0000104	it does not excite me when i drive it i am just eh the colorado is the same thing i fit in that better this thing i actually fit in it quite well the seating position is nice i can see
YOU1000000000_S0000105	the powertrain it has got a 4 cylinder ecoboost
YOU1000000000_S0000107	yeah and it has plenty of power but it is not smooth there is some sort of a driveline vibration i feel i am not going to harp on that too much because it might be this thing needs to break in a little more it is only got 40 miles
YOU1000000000_S0000108	40 yeah 40 miles we did not drive it that far
YOU1000000000_S0000109	we broke our record for most miles on a car
YOU1000000000_S0000110	it is only got 400 miles on it roughly and things are going to keep settling and breaking
YOU1000000000_S0000111	we have noticed that things like transmissions change over our break in period they sometimes quite often get smoother during the spits
YOU1000000000_S0000112	and with the transmission there was a couple goofy shifts and these things get ironed out
YOU1000000000_S0000113	it has got plenty of power i was happy with that the tacoma feels underpowered to me even the colorado feels underpowered to me
YOU1000000000_S0000114	this thing on the highway i noticed quite a bit of wind noise from the door seals and just the seals i guess
YOU1000000000_S0000116	other than that it has got the best
YOU1000000000_S0000117	i am with you in a lot of ways i was actually really looking forward to this truck so in some ways i was a little more let down
YOU1000000000_S0000118	because i really think we need a really good compact i came looking you are right i think the market needs a really good compact pickup
YOU1000000000_S0000119	it looks the part no question about it and it is a real truck unlike the honda ridgeline which is really just a glorified suv it is a car yeah yeah it is basically a car
YOU1000000000_S0000120	this is a real truck the biggest gripe for me is the ride it has one of the stiffest bounciest rides i think of any pickup on the market right now
YOU1000000000_S0000121	you think it is worse than tacoma
YOU1000000000_S0000122	i am not saying it is worse i am saying it is worse
YOU1000000000_S0000123	i think it rides better than the koma
YOU1000000000_S0000124	i think it is .
YOU1000000000_S0000125	i am with ryan on this actually it is not a smooth ride
YOU1000000000_S0000127	so if you are a pickup person you are going to put up with it i had it for a weekend and i put a lot of miles on it
YOU1000000000_S0000128	and i was fine with it but it is definitely noticeably bouncy on rougher roads it is trucky just trucky no question about it
YOU1000000000_S0000129	so i think that is probably my biggest gripe is that if you are someone who buys a ridgeline this is completely different completely different
YOU1000000000_S0000130	you can not even compare those 2
YOU1000000000_S0000131	what people do that is the problem and we do i mean we compare them so we have to
YOU1000000000_S0000132	i am a big fan of the ridgeline it drives really nicely
YOU1000000000_S0000133	it is not a pilot i mean of course it rides well
YOU1000000000_S0000134	i agree with you on the drivetrain though to me it sounds wheezy
YOU1000000000_S0000135	it sounds wheezy yet it has got good power it is really weird it does it shocked me and then also keep in mind it has a 10 speed automatic transmission
YOU1000000000_S0000136	that is pretty impressive and i found in general it shifts pretty smoothly it is still breaking in
YOU1000000000_S0000137	but there was a couple of times where i would be exiting a low speed turn and it was a little delay on figuring out which gear i wanted to be in
YOU1000000000_S0000138	other than that i think it is a little silly i do not like the 5 foot bed
YOU1000000000_S0000139	0 it is tiny and you can not get if you want the 4 door crew cab like what we have you can only get the 5 foot bed
YOU1000000000_S0000140	so the way the ranger works is if you get the smaller extra cab or whatever you get the 6 foot bed
YOU1000000000_S0000141	if you get the 4 door crew cab it is only the 5 foot bed so you do not have a those are your choices there is no bed choices
YOU1000000000_S0000142	basically whereas say the chevrolet colorado you can get the longer bed with the bigger cab
YOU1000000000_S0000143	so and the other thing just like the running boards are just placed awkwardly there is no grab handle to get in on a pickup that sits that high they are
YOU1000000000_S0000144	it should be a grab handle to get in it is kind of tall i noticed too
YOU1000000000_S0000145	just one more thing on handling i thought was interesting is this thing feels like a miniature f 150
YOU1000000000_S0000146	it got that dull slow kind of steering it kind of just dead
YOU1000000000_S0000147	minish the f 150 in a bad way yeah and when you turn it actually has body roll it kind of dives a little bit
YOU1000000000_S0000148	and that is kind of that trucky feel i do not think it is the end of the world but it was interesting to me that it reacted kind of like that because the colorado is nothing like a silverado
YOU1000000000_S0000149	right right in my eyes but
YOU1000000000_S0000150	so keep checking back with consumer reports
YOU1000000000_S0000151	still fresh yeah this is just our early impressions
YOU1000000000_S0000152	we are going to have more information pretty soon we are going to have a 1st drive and a video which takes us to our next section of questions
YOU1000000000_S0000153	please send us your video and text questions to talkingcars at icloud com
YOU1000000000_S0000154	1st up is a video question about the toyota rav 4 hybrid and let us take a listen
YOU1000000000_S0000155	hello crt i and my husband are expecting baby in june and we are in the market to buy our 1st car in next month or so
YOU1000000000_S0000156	i have a question about 2019 rav 4 hybrid all wheel drive system
YOU1000000000_S0000157	i have learned that the rear is disconnected from the front and the rear wheels get power from the auxiliary battery which get charged when brakes are applied
YOU1000000000_S0000158	does this mean that on a snowy highway when we need all wheel drive constantly
YOU1000000000_S0000159	when we are driving this car at a steady pace without using too much brakes then i am turning into risk of depleting the battery
YOU1000000000_S0000160	and soon the car turning into just front wheel drive what is the probability of battery getting discharged completely considering we have a lot of snow in north east canada
YOU1000000000_S0000161	and sometimes we may need all wheel drive for a prolonged period of 6 to 7 hours and if it is a big problem then should we disregard rav 4 hybrid
YOU1000000000_S0000162	and look for alternate hybrid like rogue hybrid
YOU1000000000_S0000163	wow what a great question and clearly shows that talking cars listeners and viewers are very very smart and highly educated
YOU1000000000_S0000164	she knows what she is talking about here yeah so the new rav 4 hybrid is actually going to have the same hybrid system that they have been using this hybrid system since the 1st highlander hybrid
YOU1000000000_S0000165	and i remember this distinctly because i can remember being in a snowstorm watching a highlander hybrid brand new car stuck in front wheel drive looked like it was front wheel drive trying to climb a hill
YOU1000000000_S0000166	and this is because this car has a gasoline engine and it is technically a front wheel drive car and the hybrid system is a completely separate unit in the rear
YOU1000000000_S0000167	batteries electric motors separately controlled at the rear now
YOU1000000000_S0000168	in in theory they say this thing you know when you take off it is going to give you power you know
YOU1000000000_S0000169	at the rear wheels if it sends a slip and it can help you go over time though you can drain that battery down
YOU1000000000_S0000170	and you are left with potentially a front wheel drive vehicle
YOU1000000000_S0000171	well i mean and just to do a little contrast as opposed to a traditional
YOU1000000000_S0000172	all wheel drive or 4 wheel drive it does not have a big drive shaft running down the middle yeah they would have a drive shaft going to the rear right where you can lock everything up
YOU1000000000_S0000173	exactly and it is a neat idea but i mean i have seen this thing struggle
YOU1000000000_S0000174	and they are using the same technology the brand new 2019 rav 4 is going to have the same system in it
YOU1000000000_S0000175	so for her if she is really weighing heavily on having all wheel drive i would not use this as a substitute for that
YOU1000000000_S0000176	at the same time you always need that you do not need all wheel drive all the time even in the snow
YOU1000000000_S0000177	so let us ask if it sounds like she is mostly concerned about highway drives in snow
YOU1000000000_S0000178	well hopefully she has 4 snow tires because that is actually the most important thing is if she drives in a lot of snow
YOU1000000000_S0000179	she should have 4 snow tires and then even if it was only front wheel drive she would in most cases still be fine and keep in mind this system was designed to be in front drive
YOU1000000000_S0000180	as much as possible for efficiency so therefore it is only going for the most part it is only going to switch to to all wheel drive
YOU1000000000_S0000181	when like you said it senses slip so a lot of the time even in snow she is going to be driving down the highway
YOU1000000000_S0000182	it is going to want to be in front wheel drive anyway until it senses that slip right but even then really the more important thing
YOU1000000000_S0000183	is snow tires but unless she might notice a problem on steep uphills
YOU1000000000_S0000184	on the highway or even more so on back roads is really where there is going to potentially be a problem
YOU1000000000_S0000185	if that battery were to be unlucky that the battery is drained when she is trying to go up a steep slippery uphill
YOU1000000000_S0000186	but having a new kid i mean i would be nervous to tell her that this is a good idea right
YOU1000000000_S0000187	and so you could say well so she is thinking about another hybrid the nissan rogue hybrid
YOU1000000000_S0000188	but the problem is a lot of these hybrids they are going to work they become all wheel drive in a similar way similar way
YOU1000000000_S0000189	so maybe a hybrid all wheel drive is not her best choice correct
YOU1000000000_S0000190	alternative that we talked about is one of consumer reports top rated vehicles the subaru forester
YOU1000000000_S0000191	which you do not have to worry about the all wheel drive system kind of saying bye bye
YOU1000000000_S0000192	when you are using a lot
YOU1000000000_S0000193	it is not going to be as efficient but it is still quite efficient
YOU1000000000_S0000195	efficiency or do you want the safety of being able to get unstuck from it
YOU1000000000_S0000196	now she has no more worries about the all wheel drive system not being there when she needs it
YOU1000000000_S0000197	thanks for your question very astute you clearly know your cars and now we are going to move on to the next one which is getting a used ev and winter driving
YOU1000000000_S0000198	the question reads i live in new hampshire and looking to get an ev car i am looking at a used bmw i 3
YOU1000000000_S0000199	a used tesla model s or a new model 3 all rear wheel drive
YOU1000000000_S0000200	how does an ev rear wheel drive handle in the snow with snow tires of course thank you cr for teaching me about snow tires
YOU1000000000_S0000201	i normally think best to worst all wheel drive front wheel drive
YOU1000000000_S0000202	and rear wheel drive with internal combustion engine cars where would an ev rear wheel drive fit into that lineup
YOU1000000000_S0000203	so ryan tire man tell us pros and cons
YOU1000000000_S0000204	this is an interesting question because
YOU1000000000_S0000206	it is not an easy answer the 1st thing that comes to mind is he says he lives in new hampshire
YOU1000000000_S0000207	it is cold there almost half of the year it is cold there in august i am kidding my 1st reservation would be having an electric car in a cold climate
YOU1000000000_S0000208	right because it would drive you nuts you lose a lot of range right the batteries the worst enemy is the cold right
YOU1000000000_S0000209	we did a story on this recently on consortworks org
YOU1000000000_S0000210	1st issue but going back to what he is saying 100% you have to have snow tires a rear wheel drive car is going to
YOU1000000000_S0000211	a rear wheel drive electric car because you have electric motors they have regenerative braking
YOU1000000000_S0000212	my concern would be when you lift off the throttle you are going to have to get used to this when you lift off the throttle it is going to be it is essentially dragging at the rear end you are creating a rear brake
YOU1000000000_S0000213	which is a weird feeling on a dry surface
YOU1000000000_S0000214	dry road right now if it is a slippery surface they are going to be dragging and if it is really slippery the stability control of the car is going to be doing a lot of work
YOU1000000000_S0000215	now you are not going to spin out of control we have modern stability controls very good especially in these cars
YOU1000000000_S0000216	is it going to go in the snow absolutely i think there is going to be some learning curve there of driving it smoothly and not dealing with all the stability control going crazy
YOU1000000000_S0000217	he is right i mean an all wheel drive car is probably your best bet with snow tires of course
YOU1000000000_S0000218	when it comes to front and rear wheel drive it is a preference i mean i drove a bmw for years with 2 sandbags and snow tires and i went anywhere i needed to go
YOU1000000000_S0000219	but i preferred that for the average driver maybe front wheel drives a little bit better with snow tires that is preference
YOU1000000000_S0000220	i think that front wheel drive is easier to control for most drivers because you do not have to worry about power on oversteer like you do with a rear wheel drive car rear wheel drive car is definitely more fun
YOU1000000000_S0000221	but what i do not like about front wheel drive cars is you are asking the front wheels to do 2 things 2 things both drive the car
YOU1000000000_S0000222	power the car forwards and also steer the car and that is what i like about
YOU1000000000_S0000223	you know rear wheel drive cars but i think the bigger question is why does this person want you know is there a specific reason he is looking for rear wheel drive
YOU1000000000_S0000224	and if that is the case then if you want the rear wheel drive because you find it more fun to drive then go for it
YOU1000000000_S0000225	but you could go with a little newer tesla
YOU1000000000_S0000226	and get all wheel drive so that is another option
YOU1000000000_S0000227	but the most interesting thing about these electric cars though is i looked up the weight distribution and it is actually not bad
YOU1000000000_S0000228	i mean so for instance the i 3 is 55% of the weight is to the rear this is you know our testing
YOU1000000000_S0000229	the model s rear drive was 53% to the rear model 3 52%
YOU1000000000_S0000230	so this is what we put on our scale we put on our scale so the point is there is some weight back there a lot of cars are a lot of rear wheel drive cars are more 50 50
YOU1000000000_S0000231	so you have got a little bit more weight over the rear to give you some traction but the most important thing is with snow tires and abs
YOU1000000000_S0000232	traction control and electronic stability control you are going to be fine even with rear wheel drive
YOU1000000000_S0000233	right i was going to make the argument with the front wheel drive the weight is over the drive wheel
YOU1000000000_S0000234	so in slippery conditions that is usually usually but it gets complicated
YOU1000000000_S0000235	it does get complicated because the weight transfer goes rearward
YOU1000000000_S0000236	thanks so much for your question kind of brings us to our final one unfortunately we got to wrap this up the question reads
YOU1000000000_S0000237	love your show i drive a 2018 accord exl and love all the driver systems
YOU1000000000_S0000238	i drove the car in light snow and after 10 minutes i got a message on the screen that the radar is obstructed
YOU1000000000_S0000239	meaning no driver assist which you are probably seeing on your screen right now what can one conclude from that about self driving cars in the winter
YOU1000000000_S0000241	exactly our concern right all of this technology and that is why self driving cars are not here yet yes
YOU1000000000_S0000242	one of the reasons sensors is a broad term there is all different types of sensors there is optical there is eyesight there is sonar there is all kinds of sensors
YOU1000000000_S0000243	if they are clogged up or there is something in the way they are not going to work well and if you are relying on that to save your life you are crazy right
YOU1000000000_S0000244	right this is the weak spot of this technology it is not perfect and he did not drive far and it was already not working right so this is a major concern of ours
YOU1000000000_S0000245	yeah and we have done a story we recently did a story on consumerreports org called how to keep your car is safety sensors clean
YOU1000000000_S0000246	when snow and ice attack so the reality is that there is radar sensors on the front of a lot of new cars
YOU1000000000_S0000247	that have forward collision warning automatic emergency braking usually in the grille quite often in the emblem the emblems have gotten quite huge these days
YOU1000000000_S0000248	and so they have those radar sensors in there and so what can happen is snow ice salt can get all grimed up on there
YOU1000000000_S0000249	and so when that happens the system is going to shut down because it knows it can not see what it needs to see anymore
YOU1000000000_S0000250	and it will give you a warning on your dashboard that this has happened but now forward collision warning automatic emergency braking are not going to work anymore so you can no longer rely on this
YOU1000000000_S0000251	it is a little bit regional because if you are in the snow belt this is going to be a bigger issue but still sand and dust and mud in the southern states is eventually going to do the same thing to keep these things clean
YOU1000000000_S0000252	and you also need to keep in mind there are sensors all around your cars these days lots of them yeah for blind spot warning and things like that
YOU1000000000_S0000253	and your rear view camera there is a little lens back there that you even in rain
YOU1000000000_S0000254	if you have been driving in the rain and you put the car in reverse it is very blurry back there because it all has water all over it
YOU1000000000_S0000255	so it is important to keep these sensors clean if you are driving on a snowy trip or whatever and it gives you that warning
YOU1000000000_S0000256	just pull over at the next rest area that you can and clean off the front grille
YOU1000000000_S0000257	and we actually did a video on this with jen stockburger that is online right producer dave can people check that video out
YOU1000000000_S0000258	sure so check out that video because jen tells you she shows you where all the sensors are on the cars and how to clean them
YOU1000000000_S0000259	but the more important thing is where they are and also your owner is manual will tell you where all those sensors are on your specific car and that is very important to know that
YOU1000000000_S0000260	so when you get this warning that hey these things are not working right anymore well you need to know where they are so you can clean them
YOU1000000000_S0000261	well that is going to do it for this episode if you want to learn more about the topics of the cars that we talked about check out the show notes and keep those questions coming in talkingcars at icloud com
YOU1000000000_S0000262	thanks so much for tuning in we will see you next week
YOU1000000002_S0000000	this video was made possible by curiositystream when you sign up at the link in the description you will also get access to nebula the streaming video platform that wendover is a part of
YOU1000000002_S0000001	the wuhan coronavirus began like all new viruses with a remarkably ordinary moment
YOU1000000002_S0000002	in late november 2019 someone it is not yet known who ate a wild animal that by chance carried the novel coronavirus
YOU1000000002_S0000003	and days later started to feel the symptoms of what initially seemed like a bad cold
YOU1000000002_S0000004	from there more individuals were infected at 1st through the consumption of other wild animals but later through direct human to human transmission
YOU1000000002_S0000005	for the entire month of december the virus was there in wuhan spreading but nobody knew it
YOU1000000002_S0000006	the cases presenting as pneumonia were at 1st considered to be caused by any one of the countless other viruses that can create such symptoms
YOU1000000002_S0000007	but eventually the escalation in cases and the fact that almost all the 1st patients had bought food at one particular wild animal market caught the wuhan city government is attention
YOU1000000002_S0000008	the 1st official confirmation that something was up came on new year is eve
YOU1000000002_S0000009	december 31st when the municipal health commission published a press release acknowledging the situation
YOU1000000002_S0000010	over a month after the 1st transmission at the time this was small local news
YOU1000000002_S0000011	only a few dozen cases of pneumonia in a city of 10s in a country of a 10
YOU1000000002_S0000012	but then came the news that this was not one of the many pre existing pneumonia causing viruses
YOU1000000002_S0000013	this was something new western media 1st reported on the novel coronavirus around january 8th
YOU1000000002_S0000014	the new york times forebodingly wrote there is no evidence that the new virus is readily spread by humans and it has not been tied to any deaths
YOU1000000002_S0000015	that would soon change
YOU1000000002_S0000016	on january 21st when the world health organization started tracking the outbreak there were 282 cases
YOU1000000002_S0000017	the next day 314 the next 581
YOU1000000002_S0000018	than 846 than 1320
YOU1000000002_S0000019	then 2014 and by the start of the week of january 26th it was clear that this would not be a quick and painless virus
YOU1000000002_S0000020	this would be one for the history books and it was going to get a lot worse before it got any better
YOU1000000002_S0000021	drastic circumstances called for drastic action it was clear given the trends that wuhan is hospitals would soon be overwhelmed by patients
YOU1000000002_S0000022	and in the case of highly infectious viruses like coronavirus that makes a bad situation worse as infected individuals will try to recover at home
YOU1000000002_S0000023	where the virus can more easily spread therefore the decision was made on january 23rd to build a brand new facility capable of treating 1000 patients at once
YOU1000000002_S0000024	woshenshan hospital it was announced that this would be done fully constructed by february 2nd
YOU1000000002_S0000025	just 10 days later
YOU1000000002_S0000026	china has experience with such a feat in 2003 the country suffered an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome or sars which is also caused by a form of coronavirus
YOU1000000002_S0000027	much like with the novel coronavirus hospitals were overwhelmed and many had to turn away patients
YOU1000000002_S0000028	in response the government decided to build a new hospital
YOU1000000002_S0000029	over 6 days 7000 construction workers brought the xiaotongshan hospital into reality and it quickly began accepting patients and relieving the overstressed medical system
YOU1000000002_S0000030	once the outbreak settled down the shaotongshan hospital was hailed as a massive success by both the country itself and the world health organization
YOU1000000002_S0000031	the statistics speak for themselves overall sars had a fatality rate of 9.6%
YOU1000000002_S0000032	at the shao chunshen hospital just one.2% of patients died
YOU1000000002_S0000033	and not a single staff member was infected
YOU1000000002_S0000034	it is no wonder why china wanted to replicate this
YOU1000000002_S0000035	and therefore xiaotongshen was the model for the new coronavirus hospital but this time would be different
YOU1000000002_S0000036	the 2003 hospital began construction over 6 months after the beginning of the outbreak
YOU1000000002_S0000037	the 2020 hospital started construction less than 2 months after the 1st case and just days after the seriousness of the outbreak became clear
YOU1000000002_S0000038	there was far less time for planning and design the orders came and then it was immediately time to start
YOU1000000002_S0000039	step one was finding a place to put the hospital
YOU1000000002_S0000040	the location selected was previously just an open field about 14 miles or 22 kilometers from central wuhan
YOU1000000002_S0000041	this kept it away from the dense urban core where further transmission might be easier but the field in question was also right off a large pre existing road which made access easy
YOU1000000002_S0000042	that road was quickly shut down and turned into essentially a parking lot and staging area for the project
YOU1000000002_S0000043	the contract for this project was given to china construction 3rd engineering bureau company a subsidiary of the state owned china state construction engineering corporation
YOU1000000002_S0000044	by revenue this is the world is largest construction company and it has experience in enormous projects like beijing is new airport egypt is new capital city and tesla is shanghai gigafactory
YOU1000000002_S0000045	if anyone was going to pull this off it was them
YOU1000000002_S0000046	to begin construction in earnest they 1st needed to prepare the selected site
YOU1000000002_S0000047	that involved 1st cutting down all the trees and shrubbery and then perfectly leveling the ground
YOU1000000002_S0000048	out of the 10 day construction timeline this took longer than one might think
YOU1000000002_S0000049	about 48 hours
YOU1000000002_S0000050	this was due in part to the fact that the project was significantly understaffed in its 1st few days
YOU1000000002_S0000051	as they scrambled to find workers especially as its start coincided with chinese new year is
YOU1000000002_S0000052	once the land was leveled though they moved on to constructing the building foundations by sunday january 26th
YOU1000000002_S0000053	for this they used a layered system
YOU1000000002_S0000054	on the bottom an 8 inch or 20 centimeter layer of sand was placed then what is referred to as a geotextile layer
YOU1000000002_S0000055	a form of fabric then a layer of waterproof plastic then another geotextile layer then another layer of sand
YOU1000000002_S0000056	on that they then poured concrete which dried over a few days
YOU1000000002_S0000057	but then came the truly impressive element
YOU1000000002_S0000058	constructing the buildings themselves in a matter of days
YOU1000000002_S0000059	what made this possible was the use of prefabricated elements
YOU1000000002_S0000060	modular construction such as this has been on the rise recently
YOU1000000002_S0000061	it is now a well established technique for the construction of buildings large and small
YOU1000000002_S0000062	the idea is simply that somewhere off site a number of identical building elements are built
YOU1000000002_S0000063	then they are shipped to the construction site and put together
YOU1000000002_S0000064	this has plenty of advantages
YOU1000000002_S0000065	1st and foremost the use of identical elements built in a factory system to construct a larger building lowers costs through economies of scale
YOU1000000002_S0000066	then when you actually get to putting the building together on site construction time is significantly less
YOU1000000002_S0000067	which once again lowers cost
YOU1000000002_S0000068	in this case though cost was not the primary concern
YOU1000000002_S0000069	speed was and modular construction is the fastest way to build
YOU1000000002_S0000070	most of the site used a type of prefabricated modular construction common with temporary buildings
YOU1000000002_S0000071	while it is not clear which company produced the prefabricated components it is clear that they existed before the project started
YOU1000000002_S0000072	the 1st building elements started coming together on monday january 27th just 4 days after the project broke ground
YOU1000000002_S0000073	they began by building the skeleton of the modular units
YOU1000000002_S0000074	each of these units was about the shape and size of a 20 foot shipping container
YOU1000000002_S0000075	and this skeleton form included just the floor ceiling and structural supports at each corner
YOU1000000002_S0000076	throughout this all separate teams out of the 1000s of workers there started to hook the site up to utilities like sewage water electricity and internet
YOU1000000002_S0000077	much of this just involved bringing in the state owned companies responsible for these but for internets and the subsequent building out of an it system private companies like huawei and lenovo got involved
YOU1000000002_S0000078	this was no doubt partially because the construction of this hospital drew considerable public attention in china
YOU1000000002_S0000079	it came to represent the physical manifestation of the country is response to the crisis and also of china is engineering might
YOU1000000002_S0000080	the construction process itself was streamed by state owned broadcasting companies and up to 180 concurrent viewers watched the process
YOU1000000002_S0000081	nearly every major broadcaster in china reported from the site publishing footage like what you are seeing now although very few western broadcasters were there
YOU1000000002_S0000082	this is part of the reason limited detailed information and footage of the construction exists outside of china is state owned broadcasters
YOU1000000002_S0000083	where the government can manage the story and what gets out
YOU1000000002_S0000084	it was no doubt viewed as an opportunity by the chinese government in a time when it faced intense criticism for its initial response to the outbreak
YOU1000000002_S0000085	but of course to gain that praise the project needed to be successful
YOU1000000002_S0000086	on tuesday january 28th significant portions of the 1st building were completed while the rest of the complex is foundations were finishing up
YOU1000000002_S0000087	over the 29th and 30th more of the overall structure came to be as the walls were installed on and in the skeletons of buildings and work then began on turning these empty buildings into a hospital
YOU1000000002_S0000088	each patient room was outfitted with 2 beds some medical equipment and a bathroom
YOU1000000002_S0000089	considering the hospital is built with quarantine in mind there are some unique aspects to the design of these rooms
YOU1000000002_S0000090	for one the ventilation system is built to keep negative pressure in all quarantine areas so that air will go out through an exhaust system rather than out under the door into the rest of the hospital
YOU1000000002_S0000091	while at the time of writing it is not entirely known to what extent this coronavirus can spread through airborne transmission a ventilation system like this is standard practice for any quarantine ward
YOU1000000002_S0000092	in addition to individual patient rooms separate areas were designed for patient processing diagnostic tools like ct scanners were installed and other crucial aspects like offices break rooms and canteens were built in
YOU1000000002_S0000093	over the 31st of january and 1st and 2nd of february the final areas of the complex were built up the interior installation was ramped up and all the systems were tested to assure that the hospital was ready to bring in patients
YOU1000000002_S0000094	meanwhile 8 people is liberation army transport planes landed at wuhan airport carrying the military medical staff who had staffed the hospital
YOU1000000002_S0000095	they moved into the facility throughout the same day february 2nd then throughout the night workers put the finishing touches onto the 100s of rooms
YOU1000000002_S0000096	then the next morning the moment that 10 days prior seemed impossible arrived
YOU1000000002_S0000097	the 1st patients transferred from other facilities were wheeled into huoshenshen hospital and thus marked the beginning of its operations
YOU1000000002_S0000098	they started with just a few dozen patients but in a matter of days this ballooned to 100s
YOU1000000002_S0000099	huoshenshen hospital was only the start of china is plan to ramp up the number of available beds in wuhan
YOU1000000002_S0000100	just 3 days after huoshenshan is opening another even larger hospital called leishenshan opened
YOU1000000002_S0000101	its 1600 beds and 32 wards were built in just 12 days
YOU1000000002_S0000102	meanwhile other hospitals were converted to isolate and treat coronavirus patients and stadiums and exhibition centers were turned into hospitals as well
YOU1000000002_S0000103	still though even with this swift decisive action reports indicate that many of those with milder cases of coronavirus are getting turned away from hospitals in wuhan
YOU1000000002_S0000104	it unfortunately seems that coronavirus with its tremendous severity is one of the few things that can outpace china
YOU1000000002_S0000105	if you want to learn more about how viruses such as this work from a biological perspective curiositystream has a fascinating short documentary on one previous epidemic

YOU1000000004_S0000001	hey everyone thanks for tuning in to another wordpress wednesday today wraps up our series that we have done on social media and plugins
YOU1000000004_S0000002	how to use a hashtag all things kind of social media having to do with wordpress specifically we have looked at a lot of different options for facebook instagram twitter youtube pinterest all sorts of different networks
YOU1000000004_S0000003	so if you have missed all those be sure to check those out i will put some links in the description box below so you can check those out and get some ideas
YOU1000000004_S0000004	for how to be using those social networks to improve your branding reach and even to just improve the experience that your users have on those networks
YOU1000000004_S0000005	today i want to talk about how to get your posts in wordpress automatically published at least to facebook
YOU1000000004_S0000006	i have got a couple of other options that you will be able to get your post published across the board to a ton of different networks all at once
YOU1000000004_S0000007	but i 1st want to start off by showing you a free option because if you have watched my channel you know that free is always in the budget right
YOU1000000004_S0000008	so we want to look at and i am just going to show you one here for a 2nd this again is how to get your
YOU1000000004_S0000010	blog posts as soon as you click publish on a blog post we want it to automatically connect over to your facebook page
YOU1000000004_S0000011	and kind of do an excerpt little blurp over there maybe also include your featured image over there and then of course put a link to get people to come back to your website
YOU1000000004_S0000012	now if you are only interested in using this for one network facebook is probably the obvious choice there it is not too much of a time saver
YOU1000000004_S0000013	but if you are really trying to connect across multiple networks this could really be a time saver for you
YOU1000000004_S0000014	of course if you are running on the com version of wordpress you probably know about jetpack inside of jetpack you have an option for something like this called publicize
YOU1000000004_S0000015	so take a look at that one that is available inside of jetpack if you have not wanted to use this because of just the heaviness the weight of what jetpack is on your website
YOU1000000004_S0000016	there is another option so let us do this we are of course in our dashboard we are in the add new area and i want to do a search for
YOU1000000004_S0000018	accesspress facebook is what we are going to do a search for so you can see that right here accesspress facebook
YOU1000000004_S0000019	and this is the option that comes up that we are looking for this is accesspress is the developer is name of this particular plugin
YOU1000000004_S0000020	i am not making money off of advertising this i am just showing you a solution that i have found in the free range it only has 9000 installs it is relatively new
YOU1000000004_S0000021	it has been updated a day ago so that is great we know that this author cares to keep this plugin secure for us then of course it says here that it is compatible with our version of wordpress
YOU1000000004_S0000022	so you always want to check that if this is later on down the road that you are viewing this video please be sure before you click install on this that it is up to date
YOU1000000004_S0000023	that it is at least been updated within the last 6 months that it is still compatible with your version and that it still has great reviews and a lot of active installs so you just go ahead and click install
YOU1000000004_S0000025	because i am on wp engine with my hosting they of course give you a quick alert and say hey are you sure that you want to do this before you do a backup
YOU1000000004_S0000026	and i normally just go for it living on the edge people living on the edge
YOU1000000004_S0000027	once you have installed it and you activate it down here on the left side of your dashboard you will have an access point to get in here and run through the settings
YOU1000000004_S0000028	now all that was pretty simple and straightforward it is installing any plugin
YOU1000000004_S0000029	here is where it gets a little bit more nerd code style wrap your brain around this do not get intimidated by this all it is is simple instruction
YOU1000000004_S0000030	we follow the instructions click through and we are able to basically build what we call an api or a bridge between your social media network facebook and your website
YOU1000000004_S0000031	we have got to connect the 2 and give them in a sense permission to connect that is what we are about to do here
YOU1000000004_S0000032	so step by step instructions of course it sends an alert right now it says we have not done it yet you need to go ahead and authorize your account to connect with each other
YOU1000000004_S0000033	and you are going to be looking to copy and paste in some things here now this gives us clear instruction
YOU1000000004_S0000034	please visit here and create a new facebook application to get application id and application secret so we are going to click here and i have already got a few created
YOU1000000004_S0000035	all you do is click this green button that says add new of course i am already logged into my facebook account we want to connect it with a website
YOU1000000004_S0000036	so you click website and then here you go quick start for website you just go ahead and type in what it is
YOU1000000004_S0000037	as you walk through this at the end of this process it is going to give you the simple code that you copy and paste into these areas
YOU1000000004_S0000038	and they will tell you that it is an application id and it is an application secret you will be able to copy and paste it in
YOU1000000004_S0000039	then it says click here to get your facebook id you will click there and it will tell you what to paste in there
YOU1000000004_S0000040	that is kind of how you do it you are just going to walk down through all these options down here toward the bottom it is saying do you want to allow us to auto publish your posts
YOU1000000004_S0000041	and your pages maybe all the other things you have going on or simply just your posts for your blog it is really up to you you can make that choice right here
YOU1000000004_S0000042	and then once you have got all those settings in place you will click save settings and you will be able to start broadcasting these as soon as you click publish
YOU1000000004_S0000043	so if that is kind of too fast the other cool thing that is in this plugin
YOU1000000004_S0000044	is check this out you have got an option right here how to use and they have got a quick tutorial video that is probably a little bit more advanced than mine
YOU1000000004_S0000045	they are going to really help you understand how to set all this up just take a moment and read through this i know we do not always like to read we like to watch videos
YOU1000000004_S0000046	but take a moment and read through these instructions this developer really wants to hold your hand and get you successfully publishing
YOU1000000004_S0000047	here is the other thing this really cool author will do is if you are looking to publish across a bunch of networks all at once they do have a pro version of this
YOU1000000004_S0000048	i will put the link to this in the description box below this particular pro version allows you to publish to facebook twitter linkedin and tumblr all at one time
YOU1000000004_S0000049	it is a $21 time fee for you to purchase this pro version and install it and run it
YOU1000000004_S0000050	and it again it has pretty good reviews it is still kind of new and it is just again been updated this year so that is great
YOU1000000004_S0000051	if you are looking to go just big and you say you know what kori i am using 10 different networks and i really need a time saver and i do not always like having to go over to something like hootsuite
YOU1000000004_S0000052	and still set everything up i really do want that one magic button that as soon as i click it it blasts out across the board i will give you one more
YOU1000000004_S0000053	this is a premium plugin i will give you one more option here it is called nextscripts
YOU1000000004_S0000054	now for free they allow you to use one network so if you are looking to do just instagram or if you are looking to do just twitter or just facebook this allows you one free
YOU1000000004_S0000055	but the 2nd you want to do more than that it is going to immediately ask that you buy the pro version i think right now it is on sale for like 50 us dollars per year
YOU1000000004_S0000056	so it is a little bit more pricey 50 bucks but check this out let us see if i can show you 0 my word if i can show you what all 0 over here watch this
YOU1000000004_S0000057	look at this you guys facebook twitter google blogger tumblr flickr i mean there is instagram in here there is pinterest in here there is linkedin in here

YOU1000000004_S0000059	all these different networks that it immediately allows you to sync your website to and with that magic click of publish it will broadcast out
YOU1000000004_S0000060	of course each one of these as you install it you will have to make that connection per network at least one time you will have to set that up and give permissions for your website to speak to that network
YOU1000000004_S0000061	and then you are off and running i hope this has helped you if you have used any of these tools or if you have another one in mind that you have used
YOU1000000004_S0000062	would you put it in the description box or in the comments below so that we can all share our knowledge and grow our wordpress community
YOU1000000004_S0000063	i hope you are having a great one i will see you next week for another wordpress wednesday bye you all
YOU1000000006_S0000000	so you are looking to generate real estate leads for your business well i want to show you guys one of the top performing facebook ads that we have used with 1000s of real estate agents and
YOU1000000006_S0000001	to help them generate a consistent flow of real estate leads for their business and if you guys want this facebook ad copy this template
YOU1000000006_S0000002	just go ahead drop a comment just say real estate leads down in the comment section and i will be able to share this template with you 100 free so you can just copy and paste this into your business
YOU1000000006_S0000003	so just go ahead drop a comment real estate leads down in the comment section and give this video a thumbs up now let me just walk you through this template
YOU1000000006_S0000004	and then i want to show you guys how to get this all set up in just a couple of clicks as well for your business so you know how to actually implement this
YOU1000000006_S0000005	this is a facebook ad to market a new listing the same thing works on instagram
YOU1000000006_S0000006	because facebook owns instagram so when you set up a facebook ad you are also actually setting up an instagram ad so that is pretty cool because you can spend $10 per day
YOU1000000006_S0000007	and you do not have to spend $10 per day on facebook and $10 per day on instagram you spend $10 per day and it is split evenly between both platforms so you are getting the most exposure
YOU1000000006_S0000008	for your real estate business all right so right here we have got this your facebook page so this is the demo page i am using obviously but you are going to be using it from your page so
YOU1000000006_S0000009	so let us say jason wardrop and you want to have a profile picture of yourself because a big part of social media is personal branding
YOU1000000006_S0000010	so you want to brand yourself you want to brand your business but you want to have it from your personal facebook business page so now moving down into the actual facebook ad copy
YOU1000000006_S0000011	i like to have some emojis because it kind of pops out at people they stop and they check out what is going on and then also when you do the hashtag it makes it all blue and so once again that kind of pops out at people and
YOU1000000006_S0000012	then we have got see it before anyone else 5 bedrooms and normally i would put like how many baths as well right here but go here to get the price location plus more pictures and
YOU1000000006_S0000013	so when you are generating leads what you want to do is you want to hold back some information or make something enticing enough for somebody to give you their contact information so their name phone number email address
YOU1000000006_S0000014	so you can actually follow up with them and connect with them to help them out with whatever they are looking to do so buy or sell a home right
YOU1000000006_S0000015	so we are going to do is we are going to kind of give a quick little rundown about this home but we are going to hold back enough that we are not going to give them all the information so their their interest is peaked and
YOU1000000006_S0000016	then we can actually go through and generate a lead so we have got this 1st call to action here and this is sending to a landing page and
YOU1000000006_S0000017	okay so i will show you what that looks like right here okay and we are not sending them to our website or our blog okay when you send them to a website or blog they are not optimized for conversions
YOU1000000006_S0000018	landing pages are and so that is why we want to send them specifically to a landing page okay and then the next couple of paragraphs what we are going to have right here is
YOU1000000006_S0000019	is a couple of paragraphs talking about the features of the home okay things that people are going to like find interesting are they vaulted ceilings is there a pool in the backyard
YOU1000000006_S0000020	it is a 3 car garage how big is the lot is it close to parks or is it close to schools or what tell me things that i am actually going to be interested in about this home
YOU1000000006_S0000021	and then last but not least i would like to wrap it up with a call to action to the landing page as well okay so right here we have got an image of the exterior of the home
YOU1000000006_S0000022	i like to have a one forward facing image and then if you want this is optional you do not have to but you can add more images of the interior but do not give them all the images because
YOU1000000006_S0000023	because you want to hold some of the images back so it gives them a reason to actually go through and opt in so now what we are going to do is we are going to set this up
YOU1000000006_S0000024	so that we are showing this to people in your specific community and then when they are scrolling through their facebook or instagram newsfeed on their mobile phone or on their desktop whatever it is
YOU1000000006_S0000025	they are going to come over here and like 0 man this looks interesting i want to check this home out they will click on this and then they will go through they will put in their contact information
YOU1000000006_S0000026	so their name their email address and their phone number and they will opt in and become a lead
YOU1000000006_S0000027	okay so that is the whole process i want to show you now how to go through and actually set this up because it is nice to be able to go through and know okay i have got the facebook ad copy template
YOU1000000006_S0000028	i know i need to have a landing page but how do i actually set that up and how do i actually follow up with this lead and how do i get all this stuff implemented right
YOU1000000006_S0000029	so what i am going to show you guys this is a lead generation system and follow up system that we build out specifically for real estate agents
YOU1000000006_S0000030	to simplify the facebook ad and instagram ad creation process for you and not only the ad creation process but the follow up process as well

YOU1000000008_S0000005	facebook live is an awesome tool for growing and engaging an audience with some very simple tips and some very quick pre live stream preparation you can easily get professional results
YOU1000000008_S0000006	so we are going to run through 7 steps to help you do just that
YOU1000000008_S0000007	but as we are going through do not get too excited with any one specific tip and jump off and try to implement it straight away
YOU1000000008_S0000008	we are giving you a process here with tips along the way that you can implement for your next live stream
YOU1000000008_S0000009	and i am also going to share my number one tool for getting more viewers on your shiny new professional looking facebook live stream
YOU1000000008_S0000010	and while we are going through make sure you let us know in the comments what your number one tip is for maximizing results when going live on facebook
YOU1000000008_S0000011	all right so 1st off before you go live there is a few things that you need to do number one is to plan your content
YOU1000000008_S0000012	so what you will want for that is a simple structure of everything that you are going to cover or everything that you want to cover in your live stream
YOU1000000008_S0000013	so your structure will have things like a hook which is before the introduction this is the thing that hooks your viewer to stick around for your live
YOU1000000008_S0000014	you will also then want an introduction so talk about the things that you are going to cover in the video then you can jump into the actual content itself
YOU1000000008_S0000015	after you have delivered the content be sure to have a recap or a summary to summarize everything that you have given them
YOU1000000008_S0000016	and then a call to action which is the next step that you want your viewers to take after your facebook live has finished
YOU1000000008_S0000017	so that is a really simple structure not just for your facebook lives but also for your videos as well number 2 is to pick a location
YOU1000000008_S0000018	now you want to pick a location that matches your videos that you are actually creating you want somewhere that is quiet somewhere that is out of the way
YOU1000000008_S0000019	you do not want to be getting distracted or interrupted while you are actually live
YOU1000000008_S0000020	you have all seen that video where a little kid walks in during a live stream
YOU1000000008_S0000021	we do not want that to happen for you so try and pick somewhere out of the way somewhere that is quiet with as little environmental variables as possible
YOU1000000008_S0000022	so that is things like light changing outside or clouds coming over trucks or planes making a heap of noise
YOU1000000008_S0000023	i am going to try and pick somewhere nice and quiet where you can just focus on delivering the content
YOU1000000008_S0000024	you also want to make sure that you are not picking a location that is distracting for your viewers you want your viewers to focus on you and the content you are delivering not being distracted with what is going on behind you
YOU1000000008_S0000025	step number 3 is to test your internet before you go live it is a really good idea to at least have an understanding of how good or how bad your internet is
YOU1000000008_S0000026	so if you head over to speedtest net or you can download the app for your iphone or for your android device and run a speed test for the internet connection that you are connected to
YOU1000000008_S0000027	the most important thing that you are looking for here is that number one that the internet you have got is stable and that that little speed test is not bouncing around all over the place
YOU1000000008_S0000028	but also you want to focus on your upload speed so your upload speed is what is important here not so much your download speed
YOU1000000008_S0000029	and you want to make sure that ideally you have got at least 2 to 2.5 megabits per 2nd upload
YOU1000000008_S0000030	if you have got 2 to 2.5 megabits per 2nd upload then that will be enough for facebook live but you do need to be aware of other people that are sharing the same internet connection
YOU1000000008_S0000031	if you are on an office wi fi or work connection other people may start downloading files and kill your internet for you
YOU1000000008_S0000032	so you want to run a few tests not just one run a few ideally 15 to 20 minutes before then a few minutes out as well
YOU1000000008_S0000033	so that you can really get an understanding of where your internet speed is at now if your internet speed is less than 2 to 2.5 megabits per 2nd then you have got 2 options
YOU1000000008_S0000034	you can either try to find a different connection or a different location or to use lte instead of wifi or use your mobile data
YOU1000000008_S0000035	or you can still go live with the connection that you have but just be aware that you might have some issues
YOU1000000008_S0000036	and what i would do in that circumstance is if i am going to go live and i know that the internet speed is not 100%
YOU1000000008_S0000037	then one of the very 1st things i would do when i am live is to let my viewers know that we may be experiencing problems
YOU1000000008_S0000038	because you are not sure how good the internet is in that location so at least that expectation has been met in case there is any issues with your stream
YOU1000000008_S0000039	then obviously then if you are running your speed test and you have got higher than 2.5 megabits per 2nd upload then you should not have any issues at all
YOU1000000008_S0000040	step number 4 is to get everything set up so this means setting up your camera setting up your tripod if you are going to be using a tripod
YOU1000000008_S0000041	make sure everything is stable everything is at the correct height that you have got your audio and your light and everything set up ready to go for your facebook live stream
YOU1000000008_S0000042	now obviously this is going to depend if you are using a camera if you are using your phone or if you are just using your laptop and a webcam to go live
YOU1000000008_S0000043	and there is obviously different recommended gear for the different scenarios
YOU1000000008_S0000044	but i will link up in the cards now to some of our recommended gear for going live on facebook live from your smartphone
YOU1000000008_S0000045	simple things like having a portable microphone and a mini tripod so that you are getting the phone out of your hands
YOU1000000008_S0000046	and into a stable position and that is really important no matter what type of video or live you are creating get your phone or your camera out of your hands and get it somewhere stable
YOU1000000008_S0000047	use a tripod if you can or just position your camera somewhere where it is not going to shake and move around a lot for your lives
YOU1000000008_S0000048	now if you are using a mac or a pc to go live you can use similar gear as well and you can either just use your facebook browser to go live
YOU1000000008_S0000049	or you can use software like ecamm or xsplit vmix obs wirecast there is a heap of options out there for facebook live
YOU1000000008_S0000050	i have actually got another video that we have just released and i will link that up in the cards as well covering off a heap of different options for going live on facebook
YOU1000000008_S0000051	but no matter which way you are going live the important thing is to make sure that everything is set up correctly and how you want it with as much or as little gear as you have before you go live
YOU1000000008_S0000052	you do not want to be tweaking and changing things while you are live and that leads us right into step number 5 which is to do a test broadcast
YOU1000000008_S0000053	so this is where once you have got everything sorted press the live button but make sure that the live broadcast is only going to just you that it is a private live
YOU1000000008_S0000054	so in the facebook settings you get to choose who you want to broadcast to and there is an option there to broadcast to only me or just yourself
YOU1000000008_S0000055	so that way there is no one else that will see it so what you are looking for in this test is that everything looks good sounds good and that everything is set up the way that you would like it
YOU1000000008_S0000056	now if you are going live in a sales scenario or you are doing this for a live promotion
YOU1000000008_S0000057	now i would also suggest that while you are running this live that you do a quick run through of the content that you are going to be presenting as well
YOU1000000008_S0000058	so that way you will feel more relaxed because you have had a run through but also when you are watching back you can give yourself some feedback on how you went in your live test
YOU1000000008_S0000059	step number 6 is to tell people that you are about to go live now this could be as simple as sending out some tweets or some instagram posts or facebook to let people know
YOU1000000008_S0000060	but there is also a really cool way to automatically post and email as soon as you go live with a cool app called live leap so i am going to cover that off in a few minutes
YOU1000000008_S0000061	but there are some ways to automate that process as well and step number 7 is to go live so the 1st thing you do when you go live should be to deliver the hook
YOU1000000008_S0000062	start talking to people as if you are delivering the content and the video structure that you had planned out do not stop to welcome everybody in and start some idle chit chat with people
YOU1000000008_S0000063	because that will not fly for the people that are watching the replay they are going to lose that connection with you so focus on the hook and then get straight into the content beyond that
YOU1000000008_S0000064	while you are live you also want to make sure that you are making eye contact directly with your viewers which means looking at the camera lens
YOU1000000008_S0000065	not looking off to the side your viewers will be able to notice if you are not looking and talking directly to them
YOU1000000008_S0000066	so you want to make sure that you are looking directly down your camera lens so that you are making that eye contact and that deep connection with your viewers
YOU1000000008_S0000067	now it is likely that while you are live you will also want to interact with your audience
YOU1000000008_S0000068	but it is really important here to try and batch all your live interactions into certain areas of your live stream
YOU1000000008_S0000069	you definitely do not want to break the content that you are delivering or the key teachings and learnings for your viewers with you
YOU1000000008_S0000070	dropping off and saying hi to someone as they come in or answering a comment immediately so for some live streams it could be that you break every few minutes throughout
YOU1000000008_S0000071	or in some cases you might want to save it all until the end of your video to do some interacting or some live q a
YOU1000000008_S0000072	however you decide to do it make sure you let your viewers know how it is going to work and when you are going to be answering their questions and when you are going to be covering off the content as well
YOU1000000008_S0000073	and also be aware of anything that changes audio wise in your live stream as well
YOU1000000008_S0000074	so if you are filming outside and a big truck pulled up next to you then you might be able to pick up and move to another location while you are still live and presenting and interacting
YOU1000000008_S0000075	so that your viewers can actually still hear what you are saying instead of having it drowned out by a truck or some other noise
YOU1000000008_S0000076	and the last thing to remember while you are live is to have fun with your live stream
YOU1000000008_S0000077	if you are not having fun then it is going to be very difficult for your viewers to engage with you and have fun as well so it all comes down to you have fun with your live streams and your viewers will enjoy it too
YOU1000000008_S0000078	now i did mention live leap a few minutes ago
YOU1000000008_S0000079	so what live leap is is it is this amazing tool that lets you automatically share out your facebook lives the instant that you go live on facebook live
YOU1000000008_S0000080	and it will let you share them out to your website it will let you share them out through email through social media and to multiple facebook pages and facebook groups as well
YOU1000000008_S0000081	so an amazing tool to automate all of that so you just need to focus on pressing the go live button instead of sitting there sharing everything out the moment that you go live
YOU1000000008_S0000082	one of the biggest things that i hate to watch on a facebook live is you join you are the 1st one to join or you join immediately when the facebook live happens
YOU1000000008_S0000083	and they make you wait they say 0 yep we will start in a minute i am just going to share this out liveleap does that for you so that you do not need to worry about it
YOU1000000008_S0000084	so if you are interested in automating that process for your facebook live streams then definitely check out live leap and there will be a link in the description box below
YOU1000000008_S0000085	now if you are interested in taking your facebook live streams up another level adding things like titles multiple cameras effects multiple people

YOU1000000012_S0000004	now there is a lot of facebook live software options available out there and we have reviewed a bunch of them individually in the past we have also played around with a lot of other ones as well
YOU1000000012_S0000005	the landscape though is always changing with constant updates so in this video we put all the major players head to head comparing the pros and the cons
YOU1000000012_S0000006	to help you decide which is the best for your facebook live streams so whether it is multi person interviews live screen sharing or on screen chat
YOU1000000012_S0000007	or just fancy branding or animations 3rd party facebook live software can unlock a huge range of functionality that you just can not get with facebook is standard apps
YOU1000000012_S0000008	so in this video we are going to tackle my top solutions for the most popular types of facebook live streams including 2 person more than 2 person
YOU1000000012_S0000009	and live with screen sharing capabilities and make sure you stick around to the end because i am also going to give you my number one tip for automatically sharing your facebook live links
YOU1000000012_S0000010	to get more of your audience onto your live streams the moment you go live so these are in no particular order and they range in price from free to $695
YOU1000000012_S0000011	what is best for you will depend on what you are looking to achieve the platforms and devices you are using and your budget so make sure you stick around to hear the full 6
YOU1000000012_S0000012	so that you do not miss out so straight off the bat the 1st one that we need to mention is the facebook website
YOU1000000012_S0000013	the easiest way to go live in a lot of cases is just to use the facebook website with your webcam choose to create a new post and click live
YOU1000000012_S0000014	and then you are broadcasting live directly from your laptop or computer with just your webcam so it is probably the easiest way to go live
YOU1000000012_S0000015	from your desktop without the need for any other software or platform so the biggest advantage with this is that you do not need anything else you are not paying for any subscriptions
YOU1000000012_S0000016	you have literally got all that you need in the facebook website and with the recent update you can now share your computer screen on your facebook lives just using the facebook website as well
YOU1000000012_S0000017	so the biggest disadvantages then is that you do not have any advanced control so you do not have the ability to bring anyone else in or to really do anything fancy with your live streaming on facebook
YOU1000000012_S0000018	option number 2 is to use live broadcasting or live streaming software like obs or open broadcaster software and wirecast studio
YOU1000000012_S0000019	now both of these are fairly complex solutions these will give you a professional range of tools for creating professional looking live streams
YOU1000000012_S0000020	things like being able to bring in multiple camera angles and seamlessly switch between them to have multiple screen shares
YOU1000000012_S0000021	to really have a full range of control and customizability over your live streams we have done a full comparison of obs and comparing it to wirecast
YOU1000000012_S0000022	and i will link that up in the cards now if you are interested in that but one of the major differences between the 2 is the price obs which runs on mac pc and linux is free 100% free
YOU1000000012_S0000023	wirecar studio on the other hand which runs on both mac and pc currently sells for $695 which has just actually had a decent price increase from $495
YOU1000000012_S0000024	the biggest difference though between the 2 is the level of control and customizability and also the ease of use
YOU1000000012_S0000025	wirecast at that price point is much much easier to set up and use and that is actually one of my go to solutions for professional live streams
YOU1000000012_S0000026	is what we use for all our client projects in the latest update though from wirecast where they got their price increase as well
YOU1000000012_S0000027	they have actually announced a really decent feature a really cool feature which lets you bring in guests to interview them live seamlessly using the wirecast software
YOU1000000012_S0000028	so it would be similar to bringing someone in on a skype call so that you can bring someone in and interview them and go live through wirecast as well
YOU1000000012_S0000029	now you can do a similar sort of thing with obs and bring in guests using applications like skype and screen sharing that skype call but it can get pretty complicated and pretty messy
YOU1000000012_S0000030	especially when you are trying to sort out your audio issues and removing echo and yeah it is possible but it is definitely complicated and that is probably the biggest thing with these 2
YOU1000000012_S0000031	they are not for the faint hearted you definitely need to invest some time into obs or wirecast to get up to speed because you have got so much control over your live streams in there
YOU1000000012_S0000032	but both of these will not only let you broadcast to facebook live they will both let you also broadcast to other live streaming platforms like youtube live twitch periscope and a heap of others out there as well
YOU1000000012_S0000033	so both great solutions if you want a really professional looking live stream with multiple cameras and yeah complicated setups
YOU1000000012_S0000034	solution number 3 is a piece of software called ecamm live now ecamm live will work on mac only and you can pick it up for $29.99
YOU1000000012_S0000035	and so crazy cheap especially when you are comparing it to wirecast at $695
YOU1000000012_S0000036	so what ecamm live will let you do is broadcast live currently just to facebook live but they have announced that they will have rtmp
YOU1000000012_S0000037	or opening up their broadcasting capabilities to other streaming platforms like youtube periscope and others as well
YOU1000000012_S0000038	very very soon they have also just announced that they are going to be integrating skype into ecamm live as well so you will have that ability to use skype
YOU1000000012_S0000039	to make calls and live interviews without all the headaches that you can have using wirecast and obs so that is an amazing feature
YOU1000000012_S0000040	and it is crazy that you are getting all of this for under $30 it is actually one of the most complete ways or most polished ways to go live on facebook live
YOU1000000012_S0000041	and to be able to see and monitor all your interactions and hearts and comments and things as you are live that you would normally get on the facebook live mobile app to go live from the app
YOU1000000012_S0000042	so it is amazing that you get this in a desktop app again it is currently mac only hopefully somewhere in the future they will also release a pc version
YOU1000000012_S0000043	but if you are on mac this piece of software is an absolute no brainer ecamm live also lets you easily share your computer screen or playback videos as well
YOU1000000012_S0000044	so if you have got videos queued up that you want to play in your live stream with the click of a button you can be playing those out and it also supports local disk recording as well
YOU1000000012_S0000045	so whatever you are broadcasting live you are also saving that live stream to your computer with a one click upload to youtube once you have finished your facebook live stream
YOU1000000012_S0000046	so that is pretty cool solution number 4 is a really popular web platform called belive so the website is belive tv
YOU1000000012_S0000047	so what this lets you do is run everything from your web browser so you do not need to download any software or install anything which means that you can use this on pretty much any computer
YOU1000000012_S0000048	it seamlessly connects through to any webcam or microphone that you have got set up and running on your computer but it also makes it really really easy for you to bring guests into your live stream
YOU1000000012_S0000049	so no one needs to download or install any software you literally just send out the link people can join a waiting room where you can see while you are live that they are there waiting
YOU1000000012_S0000050	and you can invite them on so you are not limited to just bringing one guest on you can actually have 2 guests on so 3 people live on your facebook live stream currently
YOU1000000012_S0000051	you also get some amazing control over your facebook live stream so once again you get to see from the belive interface all your facebook comments
YOU1000000012_S0000052	you have to see how many people are watching you can actually promote or feature comments on your live stream
YOU1000000012_S0000053	so all you have to do is when someone is made a comment that you want to feature or promote you click on it and it will be made big on the livestream for everyone to see
YOU1000000012_S0000054	so that is an amazing feature especially if you are going to be doing live q as with your audience you can bring up the question or the comment that you are going to be addressing
YOU1000000012_S0000055	so really cool feature and it is so easy to use this is probably the easiest app out of all the ones we have mentioned and going to be mentioning
YOU1000000012_S0000056	besides number one the facebook website itself this is the easiest one to use it is the most intuitive interface it is really for anyone beginner through to advanced
YOU1000000012_S0000057	beelive also lets you share your computer screen easily as well and there is also templates that are set up or presets that are set up in beelive
YOU1000000012_S0000058	so when you clip them you can change what the view or the display is like for your viewers
YOU1000000012_S0000059	so with the click of a button you can switch between a full screen view of yourself to a 50 50 screen split with yourself and someone that you have got on your live stream
YOU1000000012_S0000060	or you can easily split to a 3 way split where you have got 3 people side by side so not only is this an amazing platform for going live
YOU1000000012_S0000061	it is also really amazing how easy it is to use to set up something like this in obs or in wirecast would take a huge amount of time to set up
YOU1000000012_S0000062	but also to manage while you are live now there is 4 pricing options for belive tv there is a free plan which gives you 20 minutes free broadcasting twice a week
YOU1000000012_S0000063	there is a light plan for $12 per month which lets you do things like add a custom logo branded colors and you have got a limit of 16 broadcasts per month
YOU1000000012_S0000064	then above that you have got your standard package which is $20 per month in here the biggest difference is that it is unlimited broadcast per month
YOU1000000012_S0000065	and you also get access to the advanced features like screen sharing custom branded frames and also early access to new features as they become available
YOU1000000012_S0000066	and the other plan above that is the enterprise plan which at $500 per month is probably going to rule this out for a lot of people here
YOU1000000012_S0000067	with the additional features listed as telephone support custom graphics and custom formats as well
YOU1000000012_S0000068	so i would imagine for most people the light plan or the standard plan will be what you are after
YOU1000000012_S0000069	number 5 is zoom now zoom is another online platform but this one has the big advantage of being able to bring in a heap of guests into your live streams
YOU1000000012_S0000070	live streaming to facebook and youtube from zoom is actually a relatively new feature that they have added it did start out as video conferencing software and now they have brought in some more webinar style tools as well
YOU1000000012_S0000071	which obviously let you go live on places like facebook and youtube in zoom you get a heap of advanced controls over
YOU1000000012_S0000072	the people that you are bringing into your call whether it is just you and you have got other people as guests or whether you want to bring other people in as panelists or co hosts
YOU1000000012_S0000073	whether their webcams are on by default or muted or you can control all of that while you are live as well it is also got built in polling it has got a built in chat window
YOU1000000012_S0000074	so you can interact with your audience while you are live from within inside the zoom call as well
YOU1000000012_S0000075	one of the big advantages with zoom is how easy it is to create the live call or the live link and get that sent out to your participants or guests that are going to be on the call
YOU1000000012_S0000076	to have the call automatically scheduled and entered into your calendar so there is a heap of really professional functionality and reminders that are built in
YOU1000000012_S0000077	all around scheduling the call and making sure that your guests are there and in the right place and also helping them test their audio and their webcam as they join the call
YOU1000000012_S0000078	to make sure that everything is working and one of the other really powerful features of zoom is not only does it let you record your
YOU1000000012_S0000079	call or your live directly to your local computer but it also gives you the ability to record your calls and save them in the cloud as well
YOU1000000012_S0000080	and when you enable the cloud recording it actually records 2 files for you it records the speaker view which is the default view
YOU1000000012_S0000081	which changes based on whoever is talking so it is a full screen version of whoever is speaking and switches automatically but it also gives you the gallery view as well
YOU1000000012_S0000082	so if you have got a few people on there then it will show everyone on the screen for that recording so to have that ability that you are able to record in 2 separate files
YOU1000000012_S0000083	the 2 different camera views is amazing so in regards to pricing in order to use zoom for live streaming you need to be on their pro plan which costs $14.99 per month
YOU1000000012_S0000084	but you are also going to need to add the webinar add on to actually go live which costs an additional $40 per month
YOU1000000012_S0000085	so in order to go live on facebook with zoom you will be spending $55 per month
YOU1000000012_S0000086	so now onto number 6 which is crowdcast now crowdcast and zoom are fairly similar in regards to product offering both of them will let you have live polling
YOU1000000012_S0000087	so you can ask questions to your people watching and see the results in real time they both have chat they both handle questions but crowdcast is probably a more polished solution at least for webinars anyway
YOU1000000012_S0000088	what you get in crowdcast though after your live stream is some really advanced detail and analytics about the people that were there
YOU1000000012_S0000089	how long they stayed for where they came in from so the level of analytics and data that you are able to capture in crowdcast is pretty amazing
YOU1000000012_S0000090	crowdcast also has integration with zapier and with drip meaning you can get some great data and analytics through from your live calls into your crm which is a really cool feature
YOU1000000012_S0000091	crowdcast also has a multi stream feature which is actually what you will need to be able to broadcast your crowdcast call or meeting onto facebook live
YOU1000000012_S0000092	but this multi stream feature will also let you broadcast to multiple live platforms as well so whether that is multiple facebook live pages accounts groups events or you could broadcast live to facebook and youtube at the same time
YOU1000000012_S0000093	in regards to pricing crowdcast has 3 pricing options
YOU1000000012_S0000094	the 1st is their light package at $49 per month then they have got a professional package at $89 per month and that is actually the one that you are going to need
YOU1000000012_S0000095	if you want to be doing lives to facebook live or youtube live and there is also a business plan as well for $195 per month
YOU1000000012_S0000096	so it is definitely not on the cheaper end of things so the main difference when you are comparing the professional package to the business package is the number of live attendees
YOU1000000012_S0000097	goes from 250 up to 500 and the cost for an extra live attendee goes from ¢30 down to ¢15 on the business plan
YOU1000000012_S0000098	but keep in mind that these numbers for attendees are not in relation to facebook live this is only for people that are attending your call or your webinar on the actual platform
YOU1000000012_S0000099	if you are going to be using this for facebook live which is what we are talking about in this video then there may not be anyone that is actually attending on the actual platform
YOU1000000012_S0000100	they will be watching and interacting with you through facebook live so if all you are interested in is using crowdcast for facebook lives then you will definitely be able to get away with the professional plan
YOU1000000012_S0000101	so those are our top 6 solutions for creating awesome facebook lives whether it is bringing in screen share bringing in one guest 2 guests or a heap of guests into your live streams
YOU1000000012_S0000102	now as we said there was a huge range in price there is also a huge range in features and capabilities for the different solutions
YOU1000000012_S0000103	now before we get to my number one tip to automatically getting more of your audience on your live stream as soon as you go live let us do a quick recap of the options
YOU1000000012_S0000104	and who i would recommend each for so if you just want to go live on facebook the simplest and easiest way with no additional guests then you can just use the facebook website
YOU1000000012_S0000105	if you are after the most amount of control for your live streams and you want to bring in multiple screen shares multiple cameras and guests and things as well
YOU1000000012_S0000106	then you can look at obs or wirecast as a professional solution there if you are on a mac and you are looking for a really cheap and easy way to create a professional live stream
YOU1000000012_S0000107	where you get the full interaction with facebook comments and interactions then check out ecamm live
YOU1000000012_S0000108	if you are looking for a really easy way to do a 2 person live a 3 person live and again be able to monitor the comments and feature your comments then belive tv might be the answer for you
YOU1000000012_S0000109	and if you want to do a facebook live with 2 people 3 people 4 people or a lot more then you could look at something like zoom which is a cheap alternative to crowdcast which will also let you do the same thing
YOU1000000012_S0000110	but it is also going to give you more analytics and integrations with things like zapier
YOU1000000012_S0000111	so now for my tip to help you get more of your audience onto your facebook lives automatically the solution is to use live leap
YOU1000000012_S0000112	now liveleap is a service that helps you automatically share out your facebook lives automatically the moment that you go live
YOU1000000012_S0000113	so whether you are going live to a facebook page a group or an event it is automatically going to share it out to your audience on whatever pages groups twitter even
YOU1000000012_S0000114	or even put a link on your website saying that you are currently live on facebook so this is something if you are serious about doing facebook lives that i can not recommend strongly enough
YOU1000000012_S0000115	it is the easiest way to automatically share out your lives the moment that you go live without you needing to do anything across a heap of different social platforms
YOU1000000012_S0000116	including your website so i will put a link down in the description below if you want to check out live leap
YOU1000000012_S0000117	now if you are going live on facebook from your smartphone there are some simple low cost gear that can help you get much better results
YOU1000000012_S0000118	check out the video linked on screen now for the best facebook live gear for both iphone and android i will see you soon
YOU1000000016_S0000000	in this video we are going to run through exactly how to live stream to multiple platforms at the same time or how to simulcast
YOU1000000016_S0000001	whether it is to youtube live facebook live twitch or almost any other platform we have got you covered in this video
YOU1000000016_S0000003	hey it is justin brown here from primal video where we help you amplify your business and brand with video
YOU1000000016_S0000004	if you are new here make sure you click that subscribe button and all the links to everything we mention in this video you can find linked in the description box below
YOU1000000016_S0000005	so let us jump into it now with some simple tools these days it is really easy to live stream to multiple platforms in fact there is even a name for it and it is called simulcasting
YOU1000000016_S0000006	so that means you can easily create one live stream and push it out to multiple live platforms
YOU1000000016_S0000007	or streaming sources like facebook live youtube live twitch and a ton of other platforms as well
YOU1000000016_S0000008	now we actually did a video on this topic a little while back but since then so much has changed and it is now become so much easier to be able to do this
YOU1000000016_S0000009	so i thought it was time to update that video and run through the new best ways to do this or the new options to be able to do this
YOU1000000016_S0000010	and while we are going through i want to hear from you guys what social or content platforms are you most active on when it comes to live streaming
YOU1000000016_S0000011	we are going to start to pick up our game a little bit on the youtube live side of things but we may look at other platforms too thanks to simulcasting
YOU1000000016_S0000012	now you have really got 2 main options when it comes to live streaming to multiple platforms
YOU1000000016_S0000013	the 1st one is to push out multiple streams from your broadcasting software now this is really only possible in software like vmix or like wirecast
YOU1000000016_S0000014	where you are able to set up multiple output sources so instead of just sending your live stream feed to youtube you are also able to add in an additional stream
YOU1000000016_S0000015	for facebook or for twitch or wherever else you would like to broadcast to
YOU1000000016_S0000016	so that was pretty much what we covered the 1st time we tackled this and i will put a link up to that video because that method still does work
YOU1000000016_S0000017	but the biggest downside with that is that you are actually pushing those multiple streams from your one computer and from your one internet connection
YOU1000000016_S0000018	which means it can put your computer under load but it also can put your internet bandwidth under load
YOU1000000016_S0000019	so if you are going to be pushing multiple streams you will need at least twice the available bandwidth
YOU1000000016_S0000020	or if you are running 3 streams you will need 3 times the bandwidth that you would for one stream across each of the individual streams to be able to push them all out
YOU1000000016_S0000021	the other big downside of multicasting that way was the interactions or the comments they were all separate there was no way to pull them all together
YOU1000000016_S0000022	so that you can bring in comments from youtube twitch and facebook all into one chat window for you running the stream to be able to monitor them in one place
YOU1000000016_S0000023	you literally had to go to facebook and then over to twitch and over to youtube to be able to see each one of those different comment feeds
YOU1000000016_S0000024	so while all of that was doable it was a pain to set up and it could be rather frustrating to manage and see everything while you are actually live
YOU1000000016_S0000025	but the option that i am about to show you now option number 2 will require no additional bandwidth will put your computer under no additional load and you will be able to use a larger range of live streaming software
YOU1000000016_S0000026	or platforms to be able to do this
YOU1000000016_S0000027	so what i am talking about here is a multicast or simulcast platform that you send your live stream to them and they push it out to the different platforms for you
YOU1000000016_S0000028	now there are quite a few platforms out there that offer this service of rebroadcasting and redistributing your content out for you
YOU1000000016_S0000029	and in there you have got a massive range from super basic right up to enterprise grade and obviously the enterprise grade ones are going to come with the enterprise price tag
YOU1000000016_S0000030	so there is really 3 main options when it comes to those of us that are looking just to push our live streams out to multiple places without the need for enterprise stuff
YOU1000000016_S0000031	and the 3 most popular and my top 3 are restream switchboard and castr
YOU1000000016_S0000032	now all 3 of these make it really simple to push your live stream out to multiple sources at the same time
YOU1000000016_S0000033	so they all support things like youtube live facebook live twitch all the popular ones and they also have rtmp so you can really push your livestream out to anywhere
YOU1000000016_S0000034	using that rtmp protocol
YOU1000000016_S0000035	they also all have integrated comments or integrated chat meaning that no matter which services you are broadcasting to you can pull in the chat to one central location
YOU1000000016_S0000036	making it easy for you to either bring those comments and those chat elements up on screen in your live stream or just to make it easy for you to monitor
YOU1000000016_S0000037	and interact with people while you are live and all 3 of those also have global servers where you can manually pick the fastest servers or the service closest to you
YOU1000000016_S0000038	to rebroadcast out your live stream with the lowest latency meaning that it is not going to add a delay or a big delay to your live stream for those watching on the different platforms
YOU1000000016_S0000039	it is really going to be almost instant if you are picking a server that is close to your location
YOU1000000016_S0000040	now it is also important to note that facebook live is actually treated a little different it is treated separately from pretty much all the other broadcast platforms out there and you will see that when we get to the pricing options
YOU1000000016_S0000041	of these services and how they treat facebook but it is all to do with the way that facebook actually lets you broadcast live to them
YOU1000000016_S0000042	and in some of these cases you are going to have to pay a little bit extra or a lot more to be able to broadcast to facebook or to multiple facebook locations
YOU1000000016_S0000043	now i am going to quickly run through some of the standout pros and cons for each of these 3 for switchboard for restream and for casta to help you better decide which one is going to be the pick for you
YOU1000000016_S0000044	but this really is not a full comprehensive review or feature comparison of the 3 this is just the standout pros and cons as far as i am concerned
YOU1000000016_S0000045	to really help you narrow down which one of these is going to be the best fit for you
YOU1000000016_S0000046	all right so restream or restream io is probably the most popular and most people is go to platform for multicasting or getting their live stream out to multiple places
YOU1000000016_S0000047	it is by far the most feature rich but it is also probably the most unintuitive or the hardest to use
YOU1000000016_S0000048	it has got the most advanced control in regards to the chat or the comment feeds
YOU1000000016_S0000049	and it is also got api integration so that is really easy to integrate that chat role into your live streaming software like wirecast and obs
YOU1000000016_S0000050	it also has built in live transcoding which means that you can transcode or convert your live streaming to different formats different qualities different sizes
YOU1000000016_S0000051	while you are live to match different platforms that you might be broadcasting live to
YOU1000000016_S0000052	and another great feature is that restream do not limit the amount of bandwidth or the bit rate of the quality of your live streams coming in or out of their service
YOU1000000016_S0000053	they also make it really easy to resize those different versions so if you are broadcasting a widescreen video and you want to convert it in restream
YOU1000000016_S0000054	so that your facebook version is going out in portrait they make that really easy as well
YOU1000000016_S0000055	there is really 2 main downsides to restream the 1st one i touched on already it is around having all of these extra features but the actual interface is not super intuitive
YOU1000000016_S0000056	or it is not easy to find everything and it can get overwhelming and complicated to go through and just create some simple restreams
YOU1000000016_S0000057	so it is really for probably the more advanced side of things
YOU1000000016_S0000058	the 2nd one is that they add their branding to your live streams up until you reach their pro plan
YOU1000000016_S0000059	so on their pro plan they will let you remove their branding
YOU1000000016_S0000060	that is not just the branding inside of your live streams like a watermark on it
YOU1000000016_S0000061	it is actually into your social media streams as well so in restream you can set it up so that when you are live it will tweet out and maybe do a facebook post out
YOU1000000016_S0000062	but in there it is actually it has got their branding in it it has got mentions of them and tags them in your posts so i think for anyone that is using this on the business side
YOU1000000016_S0000063	you definitely do not want to have that going on which means that you are going to need to start at the pro plan
YOU1000000016_S0000064	so it is not a deal breaker but it just means that you have got to be using that pro plan to get rid of all of that branding
YOU1000000016_S0000065	now when it comes to pricing they have split this off into 2 so you have got individual pricing plans and you have got company pricing plans
YOU1000000016_S0000066	there is a free plan that lets you broadcast your stream out to 30 plus streaming platforms
YOU1000000016_S0000067	but that does not include facebook there is also a standard plan at $16 per month and that gives you access to live stream to one facebook channel
YOU1000000016_S0000068	it also gives it the ability in real time to switch or toggle between or on or off the different live streaming platforms
YOU1000000016_S0000069	and then you have got the professional plan which is $41 per month this will give you access to 3 facebook channels and also it takes the branding off as well
YOU1000000016_S0000070	now the transcoding that i mentioned just before is an additional $2 per hour for the length of your live stream
YOU1000000016_S0000071	now up from that they do have premium business and enterprise plans available as well
YOU1000000016_S0000072	and this gives you access to 5 facebook channels on the premium and 15 facebook channels on the business and obviously the enterprise one is for those that are really crazy serious above and beyond that point
YOU1000000016_S0000073	the next option you have got is switchboard or switchboard live now this is another really awesome platform to be able to multicast your live streams out
YOU1000000016_S0000074	they have got a really intuitive really easy to use interface it is so easy to quickly jump in
YOU1000000016_S0000075	link up your channels your facebook pages and those sorts of things and start to broadcast out from there
YOU1000000016_S0000076	once again they have got really great chat integration not quite to the level that you get in restream but still really solid and still they make it pretty easy to get it into your live streaming programs as well
YOU1000000016_S0000077	and you have also got transcoding capabilities again to push the different versions for different platforms but one of the cool features that you have got inside of switchboard is
YOU1000000016_S0000078	that for each one of the broadcasts that you have or each one of the platforms that you are broadcasting to you can totally customize them up
YOU1000000016_S0000079	to have even individual branding so your facebook live stream could have different branding to your youtube live stream which has totally different branding to your twitch live stream
YOU1000000016_S0000080	so even while the content that you are broadcasting out from your computer is the same you have got a different version or different logos and those sorts of things on each of them
YOU1000000016_S0000081	all managed through switchboard even little things like being able to bulk start and stop streams and multiple streams is just so easy to do inside of switchboard so they make a lot of this stuff really really easy
YOU1000000016_S0000082	so now in regards to the downsides of switchboard i think most of these are really based around their pricing models
YOU1000000016_S0000083	and the restrictions that come in at the different pricing models so 1st off there is no free option but there is a $99 per month professional plan
YOU1000000016_S0000084	and that is actually their lowest entry level plan now they do have a 14 day trial available
YOU1000000016_S0000085	but on that plan your live streams are going to be restricted to 5 megabits per 2nd and at a maximum resolution of 1080 p
YOU1000000016_S0000086	but they will let you broadcast out simultaneously to 5 providers and 2 of those include facebook
YOU1000000016_S0000087	now they also have restrictions around the duration of your live streams and your multicast as well
YOU1000000016_S0000088	on that professional plan you are limited to 50 hours per month
YOU1000000016_S0000089	and 12 hours per live stream now depending on the type and the amount of live streaming that you are actually doing none of those may come into effect
YOU1000000016_S0000090	or may affect you too much but they do have 2 other plans listed on their website for business and for enterprise but neither one of them has pricing available
YOU1000000016_S0000091	so you need to reach out if you are interested in pricing for those but obviously with those a lot of those restrictions
YOU1000000016_S0000092	have been moved or raised
YOU1000000016_S0000093	so now for the 3rd option which was castor or castor io now this is probably the new kid on the block
YOU1000000016_S0000094	and it is actually probably the most compelling offer as well and the one that i am the most excited about there you go just spoiled the rest of the video for you
YOU1000000016_S0000095	but this is the one that i think is going to be the game changer going forward and could really have a big impact
YOU1000000016_S0000096	on the other 2 options moving forward now kasta once again is really easy to use
YOU1000000016_S0000097	but i think the biggest reason that castor is super easy to use is that it is not filled with all the additional features and bells and whistles
YOU1000000016_S0000098	as the other 2 that we have seen now there is no ads there is no bandwidth limitations and there is no stream time or limits
YOU1000000016_S0000099	on how long you can actually broadcast for they even say on their website that you could stream 247 through their platform if you wanted to
YOU1000000016_S0000100	another big feature that castr has is the ability to do cloud recording so you can actually do a full recording of whatever it is you are live streaming
YOU1000000016_S0000101	without needing to save it locally on your computer
YOU1000000016_S0000102	and just like the other 2 it does have integrated chat as well
YOU1000000016_S0000103	and they even show you on their website how to bring it into places like wirecast
YOU1000000016_S0000104	now what casta does not have straight out of the box anyway is those transcoding and reformatting options that you had in restream and in switchboard
YOU1000000016_S0000105	but they do have another service offering that ties in with casta that does give you access to all of those things if you need them
YOU1000000016_S0000106	so now looking at the pricing options i think this is really where casta shines they have a free plan with no branding no watermarks
YOU1000000016_S0000107	no restrictions around bandwidth or the amount of time you can livestream for totally free that will let you share that out to 5 publishing locations
YOU1000000016_S0000108	including one facebook channel they also have a $9.99 per month plan which gives you up to 10 publishing locations
YOU1000000016_S0000109	and 2 facebook channels and for 29.99 you will get unlimited locations and 5 facebook channels
YOU1000000016_S0000110	now like i said at the start of the video we are not getting into the nitty gritty of each of these 3 platforms we are specifically looking at
YOU1000000016_S0000111	multicasting and broadcasting your live stream out to multiple platforms these are in my opinion the best 3 to do that and you can also see
YOU1000000016_S0000112	that they are also completely different offerings now if you are someone who is on the more advanced side of things and you are looking for all the features all the controls
YOU1000000016_S0000113	all the bells and whistles then you are really probably not going to be looking at caster you are going to be more looking at restream or at switchboard
YOU1000000016_S0000114	now obviously with those 2 which one is going to be the best fit for you you have really got to come back to those pricing tables and see what the restrictions are
YOU1000000016_S0000115	and what you actually get access to for those different plans
YOU1000000016_S0000116	but if you are someone who is not looking for all those advanced features and really wants the best bang for buck to be able to get your broadcast out to multiple platforms
YOU1000000016_S0000117	then it is really going to go hands down to casta i really think that what they are offering especially for the price and even on the free plan is just insane
YOU1000000016_S0000118	again it is easy to get up and running and get it working with your live streaming platform so i am going to quickly log into castr and show you how easy it is to get set up
YOU1000000016_S0000119	once you are logged in all you need to do is go to add a stream and choose new restream
YOU1000000016_S0000120	pop up on the side to give your stream a name let us just go test
YOU1000000016_S0000121	one and select your region
YOU1000000016_S0000123	i am in australia now so i will pick sydney but choose the closest one to you
YOU1000000016_S0000124	and press save
YOU1000000016_S0000125	next all you need to do is to add in the platforms that you want to broadcast to so you come over here and go add platform
YOU1000000016_S0000126	and these are all the supported platforms so you can either choose a custom server or pick one of the ones that are preset in here
YOU1000000016_S0000127	so let us just use youtube now in this case you need to connect your channel by signing into your youtube channel
YOU1000000016_S0000128	or you can use your own server or string key that is provided in the platform
YOU1000000016_S0000129	once you have logged in it says youtube is connected saving and this is where you can give your youtube stream a title
YOU1000000016_S0000130	test stream
YOU1000000016_S0000131	obviously you want to come up with something a bit more creative you can also add in your stream description in there as well and hit save down the bottom
YOU1000000016_S0000132	so now that you have got youtube in there we can add in another platform as well just going through the exact same process
YOU1000000016_S0000133	so i will back out of this now cancel that one
YOU1000000016_S0000135	so you can queue up all of your different platforms in here
YOU1000000016_S0000136	then all you need to know here is this is your streaming details that you will put into your live streaming software
YOU1000000016_S0000137	so whether it is obs xsplit wirecast vmix this is your streaming server and this is your streaming key so once you have set that up
YOU1000000016_S0000138	in your application and started your live stream then your live stream will show up here it says waiting for stream so then all you need to do is come over to
YOU1000000016_S0000139	your live streaming software for this case we are going to use obs
YOU1000000016_S0000140	and we will go settings go to stream and under stream type you will want to choose custom streaming server and
YOU1000000016_S0000141	and this is where you paste in your server and your string key hit okay
YOU1000000016_S0000143	and now when we hit start streaming we will see a pop up over here that our stream is coming through and then you can toggle on and off
YOU1000000016_S0000144	the different providers while you are actually live
YOU1000000016_S0000145	then you can bring up your chat overlay or the chat url that you can visit to view and interact with the chat that is also what you will use to bring into wirecast or obs
YOU1000000016_S0000146	or you can sync your chat with discord as well so now that you are all set up to live stream to multiple platforms with twice the potential audience
YOU1000000016_S0000147	that is twice as important for you to nail your lighting and to get your lighting looking just right great segue justin
YOU1000000016_S0000148	and linked on screen is a video which is the complete lighting tutorial to help you out with the lighting in your videos and the other video is a video from youtube
YOU1000000016_S0000149	i do not know could be good let me know i will see you soon
YOU1000000020_S0000001	magic gathering is a collectible card game it is strategic in nature it has got a little bit of hidden information where you are hiding your cards from your opponent
YOU1000000020_S0000002	if you are playing your cards onto the battlefield attacking and blocking with them and trying to reduce your opponent to 0 life
YOU1000000020_S0000003	people collect the cards like baseball cards
YOU1000000020_S0000004	and then they play a strategy game with them that is kind of like a combination of poker and chess poker in that you play with the cards you draw but chess in that each card is like a different piece
YOU1000000020_S0000005	from the cards you collect you get to customize your own deck and your own experience and make it your own
YOU1000000020_S0000006	when your true foes reveal themselves will you do everything in your power to conquer them
YOU1000000020_S0000008	it has a fantasy flavor and feel to it that can be something that is very important to you all the way down to not that important to you at all
YOU1000000020_S0000009	one of the things that makes magic accessible to new players is that luck is absolutely going to be a factor unlike a game like chess where you will always lose if you are worse
YOU1000000020_S0000010	in magic you sometimes win it is kind of like a little bit of a gateway it helps you feel good while you are learning
YOU1000000020_S0000011	magic is the biggest now that it is ever been by a lot
YOU1000000020_S0000013	i think we guessed certainly upwards of 10 people playing the game worldwide
YOU1000000020_S0000015	no matter which language you speak the rules are the same everywhere your cars might be in english his cars might be japanese but you both can communicate very easily
YOU1000000020_S0000016	when i was growing up most people who were playing games were not really seen as the cool kids but now you know there is professional gamers on tv
YOU1000000020_S0000017	this is just so much more a part of the culture than it was 10 15 years ago
YOU1000000020_S0000018	all right i am going to play a 5th mana card and then i am going to attack with my elder beast
YOU1000000020_S0000019	can kenny block his elder beast
YOU1000000020_S0000020	not with the shapeshifter it is already tapped
YOU1000000020_S0000021	4 damage to your planeswalker
YOU1000000020_S0000022	the game is just so polished and so well done
YOU1000000020_S0000023	it might just be the best game ever made
YOU1000000020_S0000025	good morning good afternoon good evening and good night
YOU1000000020_S0000026	you are welcome to our live exclusive coverage of the final of pro tour born of the gods will it be the ice cool sean mclaren or 18 year old jacob wilson
YOU1000000020_S0000027	if he wins this match jacob will be the 1st champion younger than the game of magic
YOU1000000020_S0000029	jacob has not attacked even once
YOU1000000020_S0000031	jacob really needs to not play the harmonics over here
YOU1000000020_S0000033	sean mclaren is it staticaster
YOU1000000020_S0000035	your birds of paradise and that is the end sean mclaren is your champion he is king of the hill
YOU1000000020_S0000037	jacob congratulations i can tell of course you are disappointed who would not be
YOU1000000020_S0000038	right now i feel a little physically ill but i think tomorrow i can look back and be proud about this and hope to win the next one
YOU1000000020_S0000039	yep we will come back win the next one ladies and gentlemen your finalist a great ambassador for the game jacob wilson good job
YOU1000000020_S0000041	the magic pro tour is pretty much the highest competitive stage for magic there is 4 major events a year the pro tours that each have a quarter $10 prize pool with $40000 to the winner
YOU1000000020_S0000042	you can only attend the pro tours if you are invited
YOU1000000020_S0000043	you have to win a qualifier tournament just to get invited to a tournament that invites you to the pro tour
YOU1000000020_S0000044	probably a couple 1000 people show up over the course of the weekend you know there is a live broadcast so the pro tours are definitely the marquee events of magic
YOU1000000020_S0000046	this is an important tournament for jacob in a big way he had a bitter loss in his 1st pro tour i remember looking at him after that happened
YOU1000000020_S0000047	for somebody who does not show that much emotion on a regular basis he was destroyed by that
YOU1000000020_S0000049	2nd place is the most painful position to finish
YOU1000000020_S0000050	sometimes people joke about 2nd place being tied for dead last
YOU1000000020_S0000051	i think that might have been the 1st time we saw jacob like you know he has this kind of like flat exterior when he is playing magic
YOU1000000020_S0000052	and it was kind of shocking to see him be kind of like almost like crushed to lose in the finals it is like being dropped off a cliff
YOU1000000020_S0000053	right when i lost i was kind of in disbelief i had won 2 out of the 1st 3 games and i felt advantaged and i really just thought that it was a guarantee
YOU1000000020_S0000054	immediately after i was pretty devastated and definitely bitter i am jacob wilson and i am a professional magic lair
YOU1000000020_S0000056	i was introduced to magic when i was really young when i was 15 i just started playing in local tournaments like once a week and when i got 2nd place at the pro tour
YOU1000000020_S0000057	i ended up going from like $100 in my bank account to $30000 and like i was paying for school all by myself
YOU1000000020_S0000058	at the beginning of this fall semester i was qualified for the world championships it was a lot of work to do school and magic at the same time so i wanted to take this semester off and just prepare the whole time
YOU1000000020_S0000060	right now one of my biggest goals is to win a pro tour and if i were to accomplish that it would be a huge achievement and definitely one of the biggest ones of my life
YOU1000000020_S0000062	tonight could definitely be a late night i often am a little bit too excited to sleep right before a big tournament like this
YOU1000000020_S0000064	yeah i think it is pretty important to get a good night is sleep
YOU1000000020_S0000065	i think most people try to
YOU1000000020_S0000066	a lot of people use adderall to focus and stuff like that
YOU1000000020_S0000067	i got sleeping pills
YOU1000000020_S0000068	yeah
YOU1000000020_S0000069	i like to wake up long before the tournament so pretty soon i will be taking a sleeping pill and listen to some music and go to sleep
YOU1000000020_S0000071	the pro scene is divided from a lot of people is experience playing magic it can be so many different things to so many different people
YOU1000000020_S0000072	for the average person who is playing it is much more likely a way that they sort of blow off steam after work or just get together with friends or a way that they bond with their family members
YOU1000000020_S0000074	i worry about the food more
YOU1000000020_S0000075	yeah yeah the food on the .
YOU1000000020_S0000076	so mo what are we cooking today
YOU1000000020_S0000077	this is a butanesca sauce we are going to have a huapene and then we will have some stuffed chicken breast for prosciutto
YOU1000000020_S0000078	nice when people get invited to the farino house they know they are going to get 2 things high level vintage magic and great pasta
YOU1000000020_S0000080	over there is our collection of cards that we use to play magic
YOU1000000020_S0000081	those cars there comprise a lot of hours of work a lot of hours of fun a lot of hours of family and friend recreation so that is really what it is
YOU1000000020_S0000082	certain cards you even remember where you were when you opened them like the clasas sardia
YOU1000000020_S0000084	we always had a fantasy background starting from my oldest brother which read a lot of tolkien is work we all read chronicles of narnia
YOU1000000020_S0000085	and then eventually i stumbled upon magic it was actually in the back of chemistry class
YOU1000000020_S0000086	i am a jock italian nerd it is part of what makes me me there is a lot of the old stuff right here
YOU1000000020_S0000087	savannah lines and jade statues i mean things like this yeah those
YOU1000000020_S0000088	specifically why this savannah lion is kept in plastic is that it actually single handedly won ralph is beta black load
YOU1000000020_S0000089	that card effectively won this card won this one beta black lotus
YOU1000000020_S0000090	they are very valuable took about 1993 when we were opening up packs you are paying $3 per pack now if you turn around to sell it it could effectively be the down payment on a house
YOU1000000020_S0000091	i mean it is just absurd what has happened to the game
YOU1000000020_S0000092	another reason that i definitely love the game and why we play vintage is the older artwork
YOU1000000020_S0000093	sir angel this is a card i have around simply because i have always loved the artwork
YOU1000000020_S0000095	this is the backbone of my deck it is called mish is workshop
YOU1000000020_S0000097	to me i very much gravitate towards the art i always appreciated the fantasy art aspect
YOU1000000020_S0000099	there were some early pieces of art which had some symbolism which i think provoked people to bring out the bad aspects of fantasy
YOU1000000020_S0000100	there were 2 cards in particular demonic tutor and unholy strength which had pentagrams on them
YOU1000000020_S0000102	there was such a negative connotation to ritualistic activities
YOU1000000020_S0000103	anything to do with sacrifices burnt offerings and all of these terms just started to surface
YOU1000000020_S0000104	magic the gathering so let us see where they are coming from how many of you see a pentagram if you look there it is
YOU1000000020_S0000105	perception of parents why i do not want my kids playing this because i do not like the imagery
YOU1000000020_S0000106	here is one of the cards it is a dead rotting decaying thing that has been in the ground and remember it said that it is an occult game
YOU1000000020_S0000107	one of the dangers of this thing is that it is played with the mind how many know that the mind is a very fragile thing
YOU1000000020_S0000108	teenage kids their parents still had influence on what they could play
YOU1000000020_S0000109	now it is different
YOU1000000020_S0000110	they quickly retracted those printings and that really quelled a lot of the fires of the whole satanic imagery
YOU1000000020_S0000111	that negative paradigm that followed magic in its beginning years are now over and i think you are starting to see now the growth of it is changing
YOU1000000020_S0000113	i look at fantasy as one of my little escapes
YOU1000000020_S0000115	for those couple hours that i am playing it allows me to just you know i will come back to my problems when i am finished
YOU1000000020_S0000117	the pro tour player in particular it is a grind those guys will sleep on someone is couch one wednesday wake up next wednesday they are elsewhere i mean it is a grind for those guys
YOU1000000020_S0000118	i just wonder how much fun all of them are having i am sure there are people that find it rewarding just not for me and not for our community
YOU1000000020_S0000119	yeah absolutely
YOU1000000020_S0000121	we always made it communal we have always believed in that aspect of it maybe that is why we gravitate to vintage so well
YOU1000000020_S0000122	you know we treat everyone fairly we try not to make people feel uncomfortable if they are new we kind of welcome them because no one is bigger than the game
YOU1000000020_S0000123	right the game has to be about community
YOU1000000020_S0000125	we would like to welcome you to the pro tour fit reforged in dc congratulations for qualifying and have a very very good weekend thank you
YOU1000000020_S0000126	keep your head straight in front of you if you are looking to the side we may misinterpret where you are looking so please keep your head straight in front of you
YOU1000000020_S0000128	i won the 1st round which is great it is always good to get off to a good start my opponent forgot something that would have benefited him
YOU1000000020_S0000129	if you forget what your card does it is not my responsibility to remind him
YOU1000000020_S0000131	i am normally pretty quiet with my phone in during the game i do not really like to chit chat
YOU1000000020_S0000132	he can be sometimes quiet he is a relatively quiet guy i have not really gotten to know him super well
YOU1000000020_S0000133	jacob wilson attacking for lethal using path to exile just saw a handshake
YOU1000000020_S0000134	he is always very even very calm and always finds the right play
YOU1000000020_S0000136	0 he finally slogged through how do you beat that so jacob wilson moves on
YOU1000000020_S0000138	it is the end of the day and i finished 7 one which is pretty great it is the best record i have ever had at a pro tour i can not really ask for much more
YOU1000000020_S0000139	dude you went 7 one today that is fucking insane i know it was great great work thanks
YOU1000000020_S0000141	we are holding white bits of paper and that means it is time for the end of day wrap jacob wilson is ahead of the curve
YOU1000000020_S0000142	you have already called it though you are saying jacob wilson for the win
YOU1000000020_S0000143	a terrific job by him and all these players here on behalf of everyone at wizards of the coast saying bye
YOU1000000020_S0000146	all right mama bye
YOU1000000020_S0000148	vintage is a great game not only because of the old nostalgic cards the powerful cards the dramatic plays the true reason why it is great is the community
YOU1000000020_S0000149	the people that make up the game are amazing everyone is friendly everyone is accepting you walk into a room and you will have 40 friends
YOU1000000020_S0000151	this is vintage right now we are doing an 8 man tournament just getting together with friends and playing cards
YOU1000000020_S0000153	my core strategy is generally to stop what he wants to do slowly picture a boa constrictor
YOU1000000020_S0000154	slowly wrapping around somebody and once he is in a perfect position now he can squeeze the air out of them
YOU1000000020_S0000155	but the ball has to get in position 1st that is the best way i can explain what the deck wants to do it is planning it out
YOU1000000020_S0000156	it is how do you get there it is stopping your opponent from doing what he wants to while slowly reeling him in
YOU1000000020_S0000158	what i would really say about vintage is it really is how the game was intended to be played
YOU1000000020_S0000159	vintage is the purest form of the game it plays with all the cards from originally printed up until the ones which are being hot off the presses
YOU1000000020_S0000160	wiz of the coast is actually the creator of this game they kind of i guess believe there were errors in the original cards that were made
YOU1000000020_S0000161	and they kind of wanted to put them away in a small place where they could be forgotten about
YOU1000000020_S0000162	but they definitely left us out in the cold a little bit and that is why in the vintage community we have to self regulate and why people look at us as the wild wild west because we have had a little bit of the cold show from the parent company
YOU1000000020_S0000163	my opponent right now is greg fettin he is very well known in the vintage community we put out some really good players from here
YOU1000000020_S0000165	i got into looking at misprints of cards they probably should have been caught and destroyed by quality control but did not for example these 2
YOU1000000020_S0000166	there is actually no physical card here this has too much blue this has too much black ink there are miscut cards that come in packs my friend just found these
YOU1000000020_S0000167	we really did not have a story on it i thought they were incredible i thought i would get them framed at 1st but then every time an opportunity came along to get another misprint i definitely wanted to
YOU1000000020_S0000168	anything else in there that is worth seeing
YOU1000000020_S0000169	yes but i realized i actually can not show something in here which i will show you guys privately yeah i just realized that and that is why i am stopping now
YOU1000000020_S0000170	what is wrong with it
YOU1000000020_S0000173	today today it looks like he has this one
YOU1000000020_S0000174	i would say the farinos are the godfathers and a lot of people do regard them as the creators of these certain decks
YOU1000000020_S0000175	anytime you bring up these old decks they are like 0 yeah the freenos built this built that
YOU1000000020_S0000177	we were talking earlier about pro tourism how all these kids are kind of young do you ever think that you would have tried to do that
YOU1000000020_S0000178	i tell you what there is a part of me as being a natural competitor i probably would not have mind a small opportunity to have done it
YOU1000000020_S0000179	it would have to have been at the appropriate age right now we are trying to win a world championship in this format that is the actual goal but to answer the question i would have given it a chance
YOU1000000020_S0000181	welcome to day 2 of pro tour fate reforged coming to you live
YOU1000000020_S0000182	now when you get to the late stages of a tournament like this there is a lot on the line
YOU1000000020_S0000183	jacob wilson has been utterly dominant this weekend but he just suffered a brutal loss in the hands of eric froehlich and if he does not make the top 8 that last play is going to come back to haunt him
YOU1000000020_S0000186	here we are it is the last round of the day it all comes down to this if jacob wilson wins he advances to the final day if he loses he is done
YOU1000000020_S0000187	our 1st player seth manfield standing in his way jacob wilson
YOU1000000020_S0000189	all right here is lava spike to take jacob wilson down to 10
YOU1000000020_S0000191	down to 2 is jacob
YOU1000000020_S0000193	jacob is turning the tables and going on the offensive here he has got his guns blazing against seth and seth has fallen to 6
YOU1000000020_S0000194	this is just about as close as they get
YOU1000000020_S0000196	that is game siege rhino that is going to do it jacob wilson has won
YOU1000000020_S0000197	he had a single copy of that card in his deck and it showed up at just the right time what are the odds
YOU1000000020_S0000198	how do you feel as seth manfield right now
YOU1000000020_S0000199	i want to throw up
YOU1000000020_S0000201	i am very blessed i almost lost i drew kitchen things i almost lost even with the leg bug i did not have the things i would have lost
YOU1000000020_S0000203	so jacob was about to die to a lethal barrage of burn spells and then cast a single copy of the white ley line to protect himself
YOU1000000020_S0000204	and his opponent had one chance to draw something did not and pulled out the win
YOU1000000020_S0000205	from canada jacob wilson
YOU1000000020_S0000207	if i win the pro tour that would be a defining moment of my life magic is the thing i have put the most effort into and winning the pro tour is the biggest accomplishment you can have in magic
YOU1000000020_S0000209	hello and welcome to the last quarterfinal of pro tour faker forge we are going to start off with jelgur vygzma against jacob wilson a 19 year old
YOU1000000020_S0000210	returning to the top 8 of a modern pro tour made the finals last year
YOU1000000020_S0000211	let us get right down to the floor and see who is going to win between yelger vigishma and jacob wilson
YOU1000000020_S0000213	the uggers hand has everything
YOU1000000020_S0000215	jacob is in game 3 and a 2 out of 3 against
YOU1000000020_S0000216	jelger wiegersma who is a dutch hall of fame magic player so not an easy opponent
YOU1000000020_S0000218	game one jelgar had an instant win combo that involved making an infinite number of fairies that all attack at once for infinite damage
YOU1000000020_S0000219	and then in game 2 jacob was able to survive despite the fact that yelgar reigned in anger of the gods that destroyed all of jacob is creatures
YOU1000000020_S0000220	but then jacob summoned an elephant soldier called loxodon smiter that finished the job and killed jelgar in game 2 so now we are on to game 3
YOU1000000020_S0000221	jacob has got a very good start but jelger is deck is capable of winning in an eye blink so the suspense is pretty good
YOU1000000020_S0000223	voice of resurgence he is running through what could he have jacob does not have a lot of outs here things are not looking good for him
YOU1000000020_S0000225	i am going to put this splinter twin on this pestermite do you have a response shows the path to exile to jelgar who now will show him the dispel
YOU1000000020_S0000226	and that should be
YOU1000000020_S0000228	the game there is the hand jelger vigajima advances to the semifinals over jacob wilson
YOU1000000020_S0000230	another great performance from young jacob wilson but it was not quite enough against the dutch hall of famer i know this has to be so disappointing for him
YOU1000000020_S0000232	you are graded on how many top 8s you have achieved i think that ultimately jacob is going to embrace that fact
YOU1000000020_S0000233	and as he starts stacking up more and more top 8s you are going to see him accept the fact that there is something to be gained from making the top 8
YOU1000000020_S0000234	even if it is not winning the tournament and for such a young person he is already off to a great start
YOU1000000020_S0000236	there definitely is a balance of skill and luck in magic anybody can win the better player is often going to win but that is one of the main appeals i think
YOU1000000020_S0000238	having a variety of experiences be possible because of the element of chance is a huge part of just games being fun
YOU1000000020_S0000240	magic is ever changing the cards are continuing to be good the sets they produce continue to be excellent and if that stopped then magic would take a step back
YOU1000000020_S0000241	if you are going to keep making great cards and making the game interesting then the game is going to continue to really excel
YOU1000000020_S0000242	magic is 20 years old magic is old enough that there are people who played the game when they were younger who are sharing it with their younger generation
YOU1000000020_S0000243	good game gg gg okay you want to play another round
YOU1000000020_S0000244	yeah let us go
YOU1000000020_S0000246	we have been playing this for 20 years now it is such really a part of us that i am expecting to be at vintage world 20 years from now and i am expecting to be the old man
YOU1000000020_S0000247	and when someone looks at me and he is 18 20 years old and he says 0 i got this old guy here i do not know what he is doing he is in for a shot he is in for a surprise he knows i have been playing this for 40 years
YOU1000000020_S0000248	as long as i have the faculties to play it i will play
YOU1000000020_S0000250	i am definitely enjoying magic right now and i can see playing it for a while if this year does go poorly and i do not make platinum i would also be happy to go back to school and try
YOU1000000020_S0000252	to put more of my effort into that
YOU1000000020_S0000254	season one invitational in richmond i am here with our champion jacob wilson congratulations man thank you very much with a handshake comes a little bit of hardware you are no stranger to this
YOU1000000020_S0000255	yeah i will put these with my other ones
YOU1000000020_S0000257	ok 7 cards right
YOU1000000020_S0000258	all right 7 cards
YOU1000000020_S0000259	it is really fun just started playing today and i am decent
YOU1000000020_S0000260	you are decent i am a noob
YOU1000000020_S0000261	we are both noobs
YOU1000000020_S0000262	but we are okay
YOU1000000020_S0000263	we are teaching each other kind of
YOU1000000020_S0000264	we are learning
YOU1000000020_S0000266	are you kidding me right now i just need land one land and i can destroy you
YOU1000000020_S0000267	yet nothing you scrub
YOU1000000020_S0000268	i did not know anything about magic until today except for that it was card game and now i am already obsessed with it
YOU1000000023_S0000001	fire emblem this magnificent franchise pushes the boundaries of gaming by daring to ask the question what if chess made you horny
YOU1000000023_S0000002	fire emblem is turning 30 next year and with 16 main games and a few spin offs it is safe to say that it has grown into something extraordinary the games are packed with deep storylines and memorable characters like marth
YOU1000000023_S0000003	that is not marth marth that is which one is marth
YOU1000000023_S0000005	marth
YOU1000000023_S0000006	the problem with having such a prolific series is that the characters start to blend together one needs only to look at the super smash bros roster to see that fire emblem characters are a bit hard to differentiate
YOU1000000023_S0000007	it is like trying to remember your coworkers names after meeting them once at a work mixer except in this case your coworkers all have swords and can only make one facial expression
YOU1000000023_S0000009	but do not worry there is an answer to this conundrum because today i am going to teach you how to tell apart every fire emblem character
YOU1000000023_S0000011	my face is just not built for this expression
YOU1000000023_S0000012	1st step in this process is to collect a list of the characters turns out even after trimming the non playable ones and the ones from the tokyo mirage sessions there are nearly 600 fire emblem characters
YOU1000000023_S0000013	i cannot explain that many characters i have made that mistake before trying to categorize all 600 castlevania monsters was a bad idea but the beauty of making mistakes is that you can learn from them
YOU1000000023_S0000014	and i now understand that explaining 600 discrete characters would not actually be helpful human beings are not meant to remember 600 people perfectly if you do not believe me just try to remember something about every single person in your contact list
YOU1000000023_S0000015	i have a contact for someone named zane and in the company it just says bocce ball
YOU1000000023_S0000017	who the fuck is this but unlike my contact list fire emblems have plot lines and in my experience playing these games i noticed that a lot of these different characters fit similar roles in their respective games
YOU1000000023_S0000018	and i am not the only one who is noticed this on the fire emblem wiki there is a whole list of archetypes based on different characters a list that i only found after spending a whole day trying to categorize them on my own
YOU1000000023_S0000019	and it is just so fun to realize that you have wasted a whole day of work but this list intrigued me stock characters in similar circumstances playing again and again in different stories
YOU1000000023_S0000020	does that remind you of anything of course it does it reminds you of the commedia dell arte because it reminds me of the commedia dell arte and it is so obviously the commedia dell arte that i do not need to explain it
YOU1000000023_S0000021	but i will for the sake of extending this video the commedia dell arte was an italian form of theater that was big in the 16th to 18th centuries and it relied on stock characters wearing masks or costumes to designate who they were
YOU1000000023_S0000022	that way the audience could be like ah that dude is wearing a tight fitting suit with a bunch of weird patches that must be arlecchino the servant clown sometimes to 2 masters this brought the audience in immediately they knew what that character was about without any exposition
YOU1000000023_S0000023	in the same way fire emblem has dozens of recurring characters that get you through each game and this is how we are going to tell them apart by defining their archetypes
YOU1000000023_S0000024	fire emblem goes one step further because these characters can not only serve the same story purpose but they can have a similar role in the gameplay
YOU1000000023_S0000025	and this goes to prove my theory that fire emblem is not only the spiritual successor to commedia dell arte it is its natural evolution an elevated form i call the commedia dell anime
YOU1000000023_S0000026	the newer more perfect form of theater we just have to boil down the fire emblem personnel into syrupy stock characters let us begin with the archetypes that are standard
YOU1000000023_S0000027	cain and abel are battle bros they fight together but not in the biblical sense borden chords are similar except they are usually ax fighters pegasus sisters are a trio of flying horses ladies
YOU1000000023_S0000028	you can not split these archetypes up into their solo characters because their bond is what defines them you can not have a waluigi without a luigi and in the same way you can not have a board without a cord which is my favorite doctor seuss book
YOU1000000023_S0000029	jagens are mentors that are strong at the beginning and then you will quickly outpace them and it is kind of sad like the 1st time you beat your dad in a basketball game oifes are similar to jagens except they will keep dunking on you till you are dead
YOU1000000023_S0000030	wendels are mentors but for magic gotohs are mentors but only the last half of the game beowulfs are mercenaries that you have to pay actual in game currency to recruit and ogmas are mercenaries that usually decide to join you out of their own volition
YOU1000000023_S0000031	which is by definition not a mercenary navarre is are silent moody sword swingers kind of like if that person who said they studied the blade actually studied the blade there are also a bunch of villains but for different reasons
YOU1000000023_S0000032	power ambition loyalty wyvern riding i guess and getting possessed which is a classic mistake
YOU1000000023_S0000033	some archetypes are based on their gameplay requirements very difficult to recruit usually recruited after they have been kidnapped late game recruits that could be good but you have to work hard super low level villagers that could also be good and if you recruit one of these pairs
YOU1000000023_S0000034	you can not get the other kind of like if 2 of your friends start dating and then have a really messy breakup corneliuses are usually the parental figure to the main character and they have this nasty habit of getting axed super early on in the game
YOU1000000023_S0000035	it is kind of like fire emblem does not know how to make interesting characters without making them suffer traumatic parental death
YOU1000000023_S0000037	tacticians young female mages young female healers young male mages
YOU1000000023_S0000039	thieves
YOU1000000023_S0000041	georges do that thing where they pretend to be not important and then surprise i was not an old crone i was a magical witch the whole time except they are not very good at hiding the fact that they are important and the creepy version of the georges the tiki is
YOU1000000023_S0000042	usually they take the form of a small girl or adolescent except they are really 400 years old and a god or a dragon and i honestly do not have the time to unpack this bullshit
YOU1000000023_S0000043	these 29 archetypes are useful but they only cover 229 characters there are still 367 to go if we keep this up we are going to end up with 75 archetypes
YOU1000000023_S0000044	the commedia dell arte only has about 17 so before we move on let us combine some these 6 are all mentors to varying degrees of usefulness these are all defined by their villainy and only some of them become playable
YOU1000000023_S0000045	welcome to kane siblings incorporated where we all have a sibling like bond and do the same job these all have very specific requirements for recruiting these both do that thing where they do not seem important and then surprise i am important
YOU1000000023_S0000046	these are all hard to make good but they are worth it if you put the effort in these are all precocious little magic babies and that leaves the navarre is unconnected but that is because i am changing the archetype to spicy swords
YOU1000000023_S0000047	because we can include so many other characters if we just expand the definitions to any sword wielder who is a little spicy
YOU1000000023_S0000048	in fact by combining these other archetypes there are now tons of other characters who fit into these expanded definitions we are left with 288 characters to categorize
YOU1000000023_S0000049	but before i get there i just want to commend fire emblem for having 596 playable characters and only repeating 3 names when i was hired for my 1st job at a climbing gym i was one of 5 employees named brian
YOU1000000023_S0000050	and it was a small gym but i guess it is pretty easy to cut out repetitions when you use dope ass names like skrimir dagdar sloof fjorm belf
YOU1000000023_S0000052	i could go on all day but i will not because it is time to get the rest of the archetypes on the wall
YOU1000000023_S0000054	that took like 30 minutes but let us begin the honorable knight like fiona who cares passionately about her people and will always oppose cruelty to civilians
YOU1000000023_S0000055	which is way better than the loyal knight like trude who only is loyal to pern and will do literally anything for him even though pern is a bad dude but i will get to that later
YOU1000000023_S0000056	these 4 archetypes are calm and aloof and the only thing that differentiates them is how much you would want to invite them to your birthday party i am just going to get the blank slate archetype out of the way now because fire emblem is a game with permadeath
YOU1000000023_S0000057	and so sometimes you just need more meat for the grind you know similar to the blank slate is the protagonist which is always relatively heroic but since they are a conduit for the player they are all pretty vague
YOU1000000023_S0000058	i realize that by smooshing them all together into one category i have made the majority of the fire emblem roster in super smash indistinguishable
YOU1000000023_S0000059	but that is not my fault super smash should have included more magic babies arrogance hotheads and edgelords all have a mean side but arrogance like vikey just think they are the best hotheads like kaspar want to fight anything that moves
YOU1000000023_S0000060	and edgelords like niles retweet joker accounts unironically a lot of these characters have rough childhoods but then turn out cheerful despite that and then there is the inferiority complex archetype which i could have just called the majority of children in fire emblem fates
YOU1000000023_S0000061	perfectionists mischief makers and flirts are all highly motivated but tsubaki is motivated to meet high expectations claude is motivated to make intricate schemes and sylvain is motivated to be a fuckboy
YOU1000000023_S0000062	buzzkills are just characters that are not very fun to talk to and fire emblem i will never forgive you for naming an unemotional uber religious deadbeat dad gilbert it also does not help that i look like hanuman light
YOU1000000023_S0000064	0 god am i a buzzkill a lot of these archetypes are based around one singular personality trait scarlet is straightforward valbar is chill linhart is lazy sumia is clumsy petra is a sweetie and randolph is a furry
YOU1000000023_S0000065	dramatic painter and fashionable are defined by their love of the arts and how much it sucks that they got to be a soldier instead some archetypes upset the status quo by defying gender norms or by calling out the noble class that is why they are comrades
YOU1000000023_S0000066	child soldier karen is canonically 14 years old
YOU1000000023_S0000068	whoopsie but even if they are at a child they could still be naive which brings around the overprotective archetype which is just essentially helicopter parents
YOU1000000023_S0000069	manuela is constantly drinking and flirting and just being a hot mess and i love her for it and that makes her the president of vices
YOU1000000023_S0000070	the vice president but be careful not to do that around someone like astrum who is constantly accusing people of treason for no good reason
YOU1000000023_S0000071	there is a lot of characters in the meek murderer archetype because fire emblem loves to make characters that are quiet and shy and really self conscious and then can wreck shop on the battlefield
YOU1000000023_S0000072	here is an archetype i call what the fuck and it is the 3 characters that make me say what the fuck fire emblem people like pern who is said to be a sweet robin hood type except he does kidnap a young girl and keeps her as his slave
YOU1000000023_S0000073	or tharja who practices curses on her own daughter or roger who is actually he is not actually that bad
YOU1000000023_S0000074	but fire emblem does go out of their way to make his end screen say that he never gets a date and he stays single for the rest of his life and it is like what the fuck fire emblem you did not have to do him dirty like that
YOU1000000023_S0000075	the next archetype is called actually pretty interesting these characters are 3 dimensional and well developed people like libra who struggles with his faith and has incredible self doubt even though he is doing all he can to help those around him
YOU1000000023_S0000076	or rhys who dreams of being a swordfighter but his weak constitution will not allow him to become one and so he helps in the ways he can but his whole story is one of unfulfilled dreams
YOU1000000023_S0000078	and that is it those are the only 2 interesting characters in fire emblem until we get to raphael my sweet bulky boy who only cares about eating and training and not about studying
YOU1000000023_S0000079	the thing is the fire emblem world has moved past himbos and bimbos welcome to the age of thembos there
YOU1000000023_S0000080	45 archetypes to help you differentiate the 596 fire emblem characters
YOU1000000023_S0000081	if you are a gosh dang rocket scientist 45 is still too much we can combine these we will take these 6 and combine them to create a new archetype that is as important as it is bland
YOU1000000023_S0000082	these 3 can be more succinctly summarized in a category called holy shit why are you a soldier let us just go ahead and cordon off all of the assholes and now we can take these straight talkin suck ups and call them teacher is pets
YOU1000000023_S0000084	shh these 3 archetypes all have tough exteriors to break through these 3 archetypes really explore familial bonds which is a rare condition in this day whether it is a good or a bad reaction does not matter to this group they just want to be seen
YOU1000000023_S0000085	they are just too nice for all this these 4 archetypes will always be subverting expectations it is fairly surprising that these 3 archetypes were let in chill dudes gambling a bunch of hunks damn if these are not fun to hang out with
YOU1000000023_S0000086	all 3 of these are going to time out because they need to calm it down and there we go the 13 archetypes that make it possible to differentiate the fire emblem characters just 13 of them that is fewer than the commedia dell arte
YOU1000000023_S0000088	it is only 13
YOU1000000023_S0000090	which is not only an unlucky number but it is too large for your tiny child brains we can make it better we can combine more we can perfect this granted it is a little bit harder to combine these archetypes but just off the bat
YOU1000000023_S0000091	we can take look at me baby and making waves and just combine it into one thing trendsetters and the necessary but boring and the asshole crew and the teacher is pets and the calm it downs they all fill me with a sense of ugg
YOU1000000023_S0000092	and obviously the too nice for this and the light on your resume and the holy shit why are you a soldier are all just a bad choice for a war
YOU1000000023_S0000093	and that just leaves us with the characters that are hard to break the ice with and the ones that have family issues and the quiet ones and the ones that are fun to hang out with
YOU1000000023_S0000094	and that just sounds like a pretty run of the mill awkward family reunion and when you think about it these ones are just they are strange characters that have that are good at fighting i mean if you include dimitri in this he has an eye patch
YOU1000000023_S0000095	which is similar to these ones setteth and byleth have the they rhyme we also i mean dorothea wears a hat until she grows out of the hat think about that do not even get me started on oboro
YOU1000000023_S0000096	i do not know who that is is it pronounced dice or dice and we can have a category called anime character with a singular personality trait and a penchant for violence and that is just the one category
YOU1000000023_S0000097	which proves that the fire emblem characters are all essentially the same and that you cannot differentiate them mission complete
YOU1000000023_S0000099	what was this unraveled about again
YOU1000000023_S0000101	you know the servant clown sometimes did you masters
YOU1000000023_S0000102	now italian
YOU1000000023_S0000104	0 that is good
YOU1000000023_S0000106	okay
YOU1000000023_S0000108	we do not have to use it but we need to record it
YOU1000000029_S0000001	the polls have closed in 3 more states at 7.30 in the east at this point bill clinton has 58 electoral votes bob dole nothing yet
YOU1000000029_S0000003	cnn coverage of election 96 live from cnn center here are judy woodruff bernard shaw bill snyder and ken bode
YOU1000000029_S0000005	and the biggest electoral prize at this half hour we can tell you is the state of ohio cnn calls that the state of ohio has been won by president clinton this is a big victory ken bode for the democrats
YOU1000000029_S0000006	that is true no republican has ever been elected without carrying ohio and it is also further bad news because for the last 30 years this state has voted for the winning candidate
YOU1000000029_S0000007	cnn declares that bill clinton has won west virginia is 5 electoral votes
YOU1000000029_S0000008	not a big surprise that west virginia is reliably democratic every congressman senator the governor in both houses of the state legislature controlled by the democrats
YOU1000000029_S0000009	polls have also just closed in the state of north carolina but at this hour it is undecided among the 3 gentlemen you see there on the screen
YOU1000000029_S0000010	judy this is fairly typical for north carolina this is a generally republican state in presidential races but george bush won this state by less than one last time his very closest state
YOU1000000029_S0000011	these next 2 are going to surprise if not shock you 1st in indiana cnn says that this one is too close to call and in kentucky again 8 electoral votes in kentucky too close to call
YOU1000000029_S0000012	and look at the percentage of reports
YOU1000000029_S0000013	here are 3 states where the polls closed half an hour ago as yet undecided georgia the peach state
YOU1000000029_S0000015	virginia the old dominion still undecided
YOU1000000029_S0000017	and south carolina in the presidential contest undecided
YOU1000000029_S0000019	now let us move over to the electoral map to show you what we have so far president clinton leading bob dole 58 electoral votes the magic number is 270
YOU1000000029_S0000021	well ohio is the story of this
YOU1000000029_S0000023	ohio in this half hour florida before that those are 2 big states and both in the clinton column
YOU1000000029_S0000024	and if you look at all the states that we have just said are too close to call among all those states the only one i think if i wrote them down as fast as i could the only one that a democrat carried last time was georgia virginia kentucky indiana were all republican states
YOU1000000029_S0000025	so what we have is the republicans in a little bit of difficulty here mister dole
YOU1000000029_S0000027	well kentucky and indiana is fascinating just fascinating and the word was that if dole started out in trouble in kentucky and indiana if he lost them outright the night would be over
YOU1000000029_S0000028	we should say that he has a yeah we do not know
YOU1000000029_S0000030	but in june he said if bob dole he calls himself bob dole he says if bob dole does not win kentucky bob dole can not win the presidency well we do not know yet but it is a tight one
YOU1000000029_S0000031	that is right let us take a look now at the states that we know one or the other has won and here it is for president clinton florida you have been hearing this new hampshire ohio vermont and west virginia
YOU1000000029_S0000032	and that adds up to the what is it 58 we just counted
YOU1000000029_S0000034	well
YOU1000000029_S0000036	bill schneider you want to take over with the exit polls here and i will save a thought i had
YOU1000000029_S0000037	okay we are going to take a look at the state of ohio a big win for bill clinton and see how did he do it well 13rd of the voters in ohio were union members in the household
YOU1000000029_S0000038	and they clearly went a majority a solid majority for bill clinton that big afl cio push for the democrats and for the democratic president paid off in ohio
YOU1000000029_S0000040	now let us look at the voters who decided how they were going to vote just in the last 3 days how did they end up voting well they voted for bob dole it looks like dole talked about his momentum in the last few days
YOU1000000029_S0000041	it was there those late deciders decided for him but they were only 9% of the voters in ohio what about the voters who decided before october who knew exactly how they were going to vote all along
YOU1000000029_S0000042	they were the ones who delivered for bill clinton and that was 70% of the voters in ohio so while dole picked up some late momentum
YOU1000000029_S0000043	it could not compete with a tremendous number of voters 70% who knew how they were going to vote before the month even started out
YOU1000000029_S0000044	you are very good with that john madden i ought to be jealous tonight
YOU1000000029_S0000046	checking the watch it is time for crossfire here they come
YOU1000000029_S0000048	live from washington crossfire on the left geraldine ferraro on the right robert novak in the crossfire
YOU1000000029_S0000049	republican senator john mccain of arizona advisor to the dole kemp campaign and in new orleans democratic senator john broe
YOU1000000029_S0000051	good evening welcome to crossfire finally election day came with bill clinton casting his vote in the renovated train station at little rock arkansas and bob dole voting at the 1st christian church in russell kansas
YOU1000000029_S0000052	the other 10s of americans voting today decided 35 senate contests and 435 house races as well as the presidency president clinton is heavily favored for a 2nd term
YOU1000000029_S0000053	and the big question is who controls congress what the republicans narrowly favor jerry
YOU1000000029_S0000055	let us pick up on a little bit on those
YOU1000000029_S0000057	talking about we have had ohio that has gone for clinton we have kentucky which also was a must win state too close to call
YOU1000000029_S0000058	you see that florida has gone to president clinton if dole is in trouble in the south do you see any scenario by which he could win this presidency tonight
YOU1000000029_S0000059	well jerry as i mentioned before we went on i just came off of the 96 hour trip with senator dole we saw enthusiasm every place we went i think that california is still in play
YOU1000000029_S0000060	i think that there is a lot of southern states that went for president clinton last time and i certainly think that even though they may be quote undecided i still believe kentucky and indiana for example will go
YOU1000000029_S0000061	for senator dole but i do not discount the importance of florida and ohio they are important states
YOU1000000029_S0000062	so that with all things being equal if this trend continues senator dole will stay in washington or go back to kansas but not be president of the united states
YOU1000000029_S0000063	well you know we have just got a few states and i would like to see what happens in some of the other bigger midwestern states and also in the southwest as well as the south
YOU1000000029_S0000064	if you take a look at the senate races in a lot of the states too new hampshire has gone to a democrat there are other states where it is just too close to call and there are only a limited number of seats that democrats need to take it over
YOU1000000029_S0000065	what is your feeling on this you have been looking at the numbers all along
YOU1000000029_S0000067	my feeling is that we pick up like one seat i am sure that john breaux may have a different view but i think we would pick up the 4 southern open democrat seats
YOU1000000029_S0000068	and the other ones really just are too close to call like oregon and colorado and maine is a very close race georgia too georgia yeah and arkansas is close so i think that we may be up very late tonight
YOU1000000029_S0000069	senator john burrow this is very good news for president clinton but i wonder if you are popping champagne corks yet
YOU1000000029_S0000070	because all the early indications are that you are not going to control the congress you are not going to control the senate or the house
YOU1000000029_S0000071	so this is a kind of a weltschmerz you know what weltschmerz means it is a little bit of sorrow and a little bit of happiness is not it
YOU1000000029_S0000072	bob you must be struggling this is devastating news for senator dole in a sense when you do not not carry ohio which every republican president has always carried and you lose florida that is very bad news for senator dole
YOU1000000029_S0000073	as far as winning an electoral victory and we are not finished voting here in louisiana we got about an hour and a half left and i am very confident that mary landrieu will be victorious
YOU1000000029_S0000074	i think i would agree with john mccain my friend that the senate is going to be very close i would not be surprised if it was 51 49 either way
YOU1000000029_S0000075	well can you explain to me how by the way of course the winning ohio and florida does not come under the category of huge surprises everybody thought that the president was going to win those states
YOU1000000029_S0000076	but i just would like you to address my initial question senator on how you can square the apparent big victory of president clinton
YOU1000000029_S0000077	with the with with uphill struggle i think you have to win the house and senate and let me just give a suggestion of what is wrong you are dying in the south is not that right
YOU1000000029_S0000078	no not at all i think that we are going to do well in georgia i think we are going to win i think we are going to win in louisiana we are going to win in arkansas but i think the basic answer to the question bob is very simple and that is that people vote for their senator
YOU1000000029_S0000079	because of what he says or she says in their respective states it is not that connected to the presidential election i think you can have people voting for president clinton and perhaps voting for a republican senator
YOU1000000029_S0000080	but we feel very comfortable in the south we have got good moderate candidates despite an onslaught of this liberal liberal liberal charge for people who are very moderate to middle of the road candidates that we have
YOU1000000029_S0000081	well is not it true that the problem is that some of your candidates in the south like mary landrieu in louisiana and max cleland in georgia were election year moderates they have been liberals all their life and perhaps the voters saw through them
YOU1000000029_S0000082	bob it is really interesting they charging mary landrieu with being a liberal here is a person who supports the death penalty supports carrying concealed weapons in louisiana and also will support a constitutional amendment to balance the budget that does not sound very liberal to me
YOU1000000029_S0000083	she is awesome
YOU1000000029_S0000084	that is what she has been charged with
YOU1000000029_S0000085	she also opposed the bill to ban the late term abortions
YOU1000000029_S0000086	absolutely
YOU1000000029_S0000088	bob there you go again falling for some of the republican rhetoric she clearly has said that she would have voted just like me and bennett johnson on that issue but her opponent and others keep saying well that is not her position that is what she said very clearly
YOU1000000029_S0000089	we are going to break right now we are going to come back and discuss whether or not there is going to be a majority in the house that is a democratic majority or republican majority right after this break
YOU1000000029_S0000092	crossfire is brought to you by lci international a very different long distance phone company and by chrysler and the cab forward sedan of chrysler what is new in your world
YOU1000000029_S0000094	welcome back to crossfire we are talking about election 96 with senator john mccain republican of arizona and adult advisor in new orleans senator john breaux democrat of louisiana
YOU1000000029_S0000096	senator let me just pursue this whole thing about a republican majority in the senate just a little bit further because a lot of us are worried about what will happen once that republican majority comes in if a republican majority comes in
YOU1000000029_S0000097	are you guys going to go after the clinton administration again for another 4 years or are you going to get down to some serious work in the senate for a change
YOU1000000029_S0000098	jerry could i mention what real quick before i answer and that is that we are pleased to see the closure in the popular vote as you know many of the polls like abc had president clinton by 16 and the teens and
YOU1000000029_S0000099	it looks like that is significant closure which could affect some of these other states but look jerry you would agree with me that what has been happening
YOU1000000029_S0000100	win this foreign money is really incredible and it is not being reported by the republicans it is every major newspaper in america there clearly has to be an investigation of that
YOU1000000029_S0000101	now if that is called going after the president then yeah we will be going after it if we have the majority but i think that i mean i have been around politics for a long time the 3 of us have i have never seen anything like this i have never seen
YOU1000000029_S0000102	we just saw on the front page of the new york times today mister riotti had what 12 visits
YOU1000000029_S0000103	their way senator to go at one of these things to do an investigation which lasts a month or 2 months or whatever is necessary to get the work done or to have one that goes on for years
YOU1000000029_S0000104	like this whole whitewater situation has gone on for years with senator trump
YOU1000000029_S0000106	can we expect that to come up again
YOU1000000029_S0000107	well what i hope is that we have a howard baker on the democrat side as they did during watergate a bipartisan democrat will say look we have got to look into this and we have got to go at it in a
YOU1000000029_S0000109	i hope so
YOU1000000029_S0000110	i will take you up on that john burrow are you ready to play the role of howard baker and ask bill clinton what did he know and when did he know it about this laundered money from indonesia
YOU1000000029_S0000111	bob the problem is bipartisan it is a bipartisan problem just yesterday one person who was a supporter and worked for the dole campaign confessed to making a $120000 illegal contribution
YOU1000000029_S0000112	i think the american people want us to look at some new campaign finance reform john mccain i think is a leader on this issue along with our democratic side that is what i think the people want they want to make sure we do it right in the future
YOU1000000029_S0000114	spent a great deal of time
YOU1000000029_S0000115	just harping on what has happened in the past because it has been both sides and both sides have to clean up our act
YOU1000000029_S0000116	well john as a realistic louisiana politician and you are one of the best of them would you agree with me that a lot is at stake tonight for the president
YOU1000000029_S0000117	on who controls the congressional machinery of the house and the senate as to what kind of investigation there is going to be
YOU1000000029_S0000118	well
YOU1000000035_S0000000	hello and welcome to animal watch and this week we are talking the turkish kangal dog
YOU1000000035_S0000002	there are a few breeds in the world who are known as formidable flock guardians
YOU1000000035_S0000003	one being the feared and immense kangol
YOU1000000035_S0000005	claim to have the size strength and ferocity to kill wolves in order to protect their flock
YOU1000000035_S0000006	claimed to have the speed and launch power of a ferrari
YOU1000000035_S0000007	and suggested to have a bite force that is the most powerful out of every dog breed there is
YOU1000000035_S0000009	possessing an old and ancient history that goes back 1000s of years
YOU1000000035_S0000010	some stories even suggest that actual wolf blood runs through their veins
YOU1000000035_S0000012	but what is the truth are these huge herding dogs mindless killers or simply protectors of the innocent
YOU1000000035_S0000014	are they suitable as pets or best left as working dogs
YOU1000000035_S0000015	and can they really kill a wolf or are they simply effective wolf deterrents
YOU1000000035_S0000016	today i am visiting carl westfield in the uk who is guardian of several kangals
YOU1000000035_S0000017	and also one of the uk is top kangal experts sheila reid in order to find out just what the temperament is
YOU1000000035_S0000018	of one of these incredible looking dogs and also the truth
YOU1000000035_S0000020	my car
YOU1000000035_S0000021	0 hi annika
YOU1000000035_S0000022	nice to meet you
YOU1000000035_S0000023	these are my can gals
YOU1000000035_S0000024	wow look at him hello
YOU1000000035_S0000025	this is dave here
YOU1000000035_S0000026	stay
YOU1000000035_S0000027	yes this is dave
YOU1000000035_S0000029	what a tough favorite kegel i love it
YOU1000000035_S0000030	it is amazing
YOU1000000035_S0000032	0 it is beautiful is not it
YOU1000000035_S0000033	this is dave and kajaz
YOU1000000035_S0000034	that is a pretty name
YOU1000000035_S0000035	i met carl is 2 kangals and the 1st thing that hit me was how lovely they were really affectionate and welcoming of strangers
YOU1000000035_S0000036	dave his male kangal just wanted to be petted and loved to roll over and fall down in my lap
YOU1000000035_S0000037	the 2 dogs had an obvious roving curiosity and carl mentioned that he preferred to keep them leashed
YOU1000000035_S0000038	as their protective streak would kick in like a ferrari from 0 to 80 miles per hour if a passing dog went by in the distance
YOU1000000035_S0000039	even though they had just been introduced to this field apparently it would now have become their territory to protect and keep safe
YOU1000000035_S0000040	well carl these are beautiful beautiful dogs it is the 1st time i have ever met a kangal dog you get this sort of idea when people go on about them being
YOU1000000035_S0000041	you know sort of these ferocious plot guardians and that that they are going to be somewhat unfriendly but they have been so sweet and lovely
YOU1000000035_S0000042	they are with people and families and especially children
YOU1000000035_S0000043	a good kanga is completely solid temperament basically calm until roused
YOU1000000035_S0000044	they can be confrontational if they consider that there is something outside of what they perceive to be their flock
YOU1000000035_S0000045	their family their guardian their area if anything kind of threatens that then yes they do come alive
YOU1000000035_S0000046	it is very very well documented that they are exceptional with children literally because for centuries they have had to grow up in villages
YOU1000000035_S0000047	yes
YOU1000000035_S0000048	with children running around and they can not show any undue aggression otherwise they would be fiercely treated
YOU1000000035_S0000049	how tall do the kangals stand
YOU1000000035_S0000050	again there is quite a disparity with what you think is a massive kangal versus what is the reality of a kangal
YOU1000000035_S0000051	i believe if you do any googling or if you look at youtube pictures
YOU1000000035_S0000052	or wherever you sometimes see massive dogs generally originating out of turkey that are coming in at 80 90 100 kilos
YOU1000000035_S0000053	these are just not kangaroo they are not a working dog they could not do a day is work
YOU1000000035_S0000054	these are more of the proper working kangals that are out there with the shepherds
YOU1000000035_S0000056	there is big there is small within a standard is that anywhere between 28 and 32 approximately
YOU1000000035_S0000057	how heavy are the kangals approximately
YOU1000000035_S0000058	0 anywhere between about 90 and £130
YOU1000000035_S0000059	let us just quickly talk about dave is ears here because i know people comment a lot about cropped ears
YOU1000000035_S0000060	in the united kingdom we do not crop ears it is illegal he is an import and of course when they come in from working lines they have been cropped
YOU1000000035_S0000061	when they have been very very young and of course little dave here is an import so he is not being cropped here in the uk
YOU1000000035_S0000062	and carl certainly does not prop any of the ears and of course as you can see here on the female this is what their ears are supposed to look like
YOU1000000035_S0000063	so what is it like having a kangol in your house
YOU1000000035_S0000064	for such a big docks sometimes you can not hear them you do not know where they are and yet they know
YOU1000000035_S0000065	they constantly watch they will pretty much sleep with one eye open so they will know exactly what is happening anything out of the unusual then they will let you know
YOU1000000035_S0000066	yeah so if somebody rings the doorbell will they fly up
YOU1000000035_S0000067	yeah they want to know what it is
YOU1000000035_S0000068	how about if somebody is walking a dog past your window
YOU1000000035_S0000069	yeah then they will yes they will go mental they will go mental
YOU1000000035_S0000071	if i came to greet you in your house would they still treat me exactly the same
YOU1000000035_S0000072	exactly the same
YOU1000000035_S0000073	so just lovely dogs actually really really lovely dogs that have got a bit of a rubbish reputation i have got to say on some of the clips that i have been seeing
YOU1000000035_S0000074	what is the life expectancy for a kangal because they are quite large dogs but they are healthy
YOU1000000035_S0000075	yes they are very very healthy it is normally fair to say that the bigger the dog the less long they live yeah
YOU1000000035_S0000076	but that is quite unusual with these because i have known dogs that are 14 15 16 years old
YOU1000000035_S0000077	that is a really good age that is a good age healthy age
YOU1000000035_S0000078	they live and work for a very long time
YOU1000000035_S0000079	it is an unbelievable coat i mean if i rub my hands up here it is dense the undercoat hello dave
YOU1000000035_S0000081	it is so sweet
YOU1000000035_S0000083	it is so thick and dense is not it and like the undercoat is the same length as the guard hair is not it yeah
YOU1000000035_S0000084	and you can see how they can keep so warm up in the mountains i mean how cold does it get in turkey
YOU1000000035_S0000086	in the winters it has got to be -30
YOU1000000035_S0000087	-30 it must be somewhere like that yeah and of course they crop the ears out there because they can get frostbite and one of the 1st things to go is the ears
YOU1000000035_S0000088	as well of course if they come into a confrontation with a wolf a wolf will latch on to anything that is hanging off so it is like the ears this is the only color they come in then i presume
YOU1000000035_S0000089	what color is this called
YOU1000000035_S0000090	is fawn with a black mask
YOU1000000035_S0000091	and it is a very similar color to akita is is not it that is why you said they sometimes get muddled up
YOU1000000035_S0000092	yeah there is that and of course they have a similar akita tail
YOU1000000035_S0000094	they are not rambunctious they are not rambunctious or clumsy or anything like that they are just very okay so they are just very calm
YOU1000000035_S0000095	you could have quite a small child with them and they are not going to jump on them or scratch them they seem very very relaxed to me these dogs are very very aloof
YOU1000000035_S0000096	and they are very independent if you let them off the lead and they see something you were saying they could just literally go
YOU1000000035_S0000097	yeah they will always on a leash you have got to be quite a brave person to let your kangaroo run loose
YOU1000000035_S0000098	it might be fair to say that if you get recall from your kangal you will go down in history
YOU1000000035_S0000100	when they go it is gosh they pull they really pull
YOU1000000035_S0000101	they have greater strength than what they seem to be in their size
YOU1000000035_S0000102	you have got to be fairly young and agile and fit and strong to have one of these dogs
YOU1000000035_S0000103	a fenced garden
YOU1000000035_S0000104	fence garden because you were saying your boy here is a jumper so yeah
YOU1000000035_S0000105	they are also very very good diggers 0 really are they they are very very good diggers they will dig under fences to get out
YOU1000000035_S0000106	that i think the digging comes back from in summertime
YOU1000000035_S0000107	in summertime they will dig for a cool shade cool area
YOU1000000035_S0000108	and then in the wintertime they go down in the slow weeks exactly like a wolf will do that too what do they eat
YOU1000000035_S0000109	what do they eat what do your ones eat mine eat fresh meat fresh meat of biscuit or kibble or anything
YOU1000000035_S0000111	that i have got for them they survive on very little actually it is not true to say that they are big dogs and you have got to feed them £234 of meat a day
YOU1000000035_S0000112	no they survive on quite a small amount of food
YOU1000000035_S0000113	maybe that is because of their breeding and their having to be up in the mountains
YOU1000000035_S0000115	later that week i dropped by to meet a very special lady indeed sheila reid respected across the uk for her expertise in the kangal breed
YOU1000000035_S0000116	both her and her husband michael had kept kangals for decades now and had traveled out to turkey many times to source dogs from working lines
YOU1000000035_S0000117	if there was anyone who knew the kangal better then it would be her
YOU1000000035_S0000118	we fell in love with the breed
YOU1000000035_S0000120	our old dog had died and we just wanted we wanted a natural dog we went to see a lady called missus betty marshall
YOU1000000035_S0000121	and she brought out her dog called fenne he stood on his back legs and he put his paws on my shoulders
YOU1000000035_S0000123	and he looked me in the eye
YOU1000000035_S0000125	and he looked right into my soul
YOU1000000035_S0000127	i was like
YOU1000000035_S0000129	the turkish people will tell you that they came with them as they moved up through into turkey they have been used for 1000s and 1000s of years
YOU1000000035_S0000130	and it is their role to protect whatever it is that they live with that is what they do naturally
YOU1000000035_S0000131	if you go into turkey and you go into the villages you will see the old dogs and if they are no longer fit
YOU1000000035_S0000132	you know and young out with the flock they actually stay in the villages and when the children start to wander off
YOU1000000035_S0000133	you will actually see the old dogs go and heave themselves to their feet but they will go off with the children
YOU1000000035_S0000134	to ensure that the children are never alone and they are their guardian so they do not march up and down being aggressive
YOU1000000035_S0000135	they just wander quietly along making sure the children are safe certainly the cargyle dog can kill a wolf without any problem at all
YOU1000000035_S0000136	if you watch the kangal dogs when they are young puppies their mother teaches them in play and they will use their shoulders to charge
YOU1000000035_S0000137	they do not always win we had a very very sad story we went out on a vaccination program in 2003 i think it was
YOU1000000035_S0000138	one day we went up to the top of the mountain to this village 1st and there were only 3 puppies
YOU1000000035_S0000139	and that was because the previous week there was a big big pack of wolves had come into the village in the middle of the night
YOU1000000035_S0000140	and the males had gone out and what had happened is they had gone into attack mode with the wolves
YOU1000000035_S0000141	the wolves basically were winning
YOU1000000035_S0000143	so the people of the village got their burning staves and gone out but the mother of these puppies had been in a shed with the puppies
YOU1000000035_S0000144	when she could hear that things were going badly because it is usually the bitch that kills the wolves not the males she would broken free
YOU1000000035_S0000146	and left the puppies locked in a safe place and gone out so between her and the villagers the wolves were chased away
YOU1000000035_S0000147	but all of the males were dead but she was severely damaged they do take enormous care of their dogs
YOU1000000035_S0000148	and they worked very hard on her but unfortunately she did not survive and all they would got left were these 3 puppies and the villagers were absolutely heartbroken
YOU1000000035_S0000149	but the turks do not recognize any dog called an anatolian shepherd dog
YOU1000000035_S0000150	to them the word anatolian shepherd they do not accept the word anatolian because that is just a plateau in turkey it is a nothingness
YOU1000000035_S0000151	it was a word that was taken up by the americans to give it a name
YOU1000000035_S0000152	and basically it is a word that covers any big dog that comes from turkey any dog over 24 inches that comes out of turkey
YOU1000000035_S0000153	so it can be any color any coat length anything really whereas a conga dog is a particular type
YOU1000000035_S0000154	if you look at an anatolian shepherd dog some of them look like kangal dogs because a lot of them might have in their background a grandfather or a grandmother
YOU1000000035_S0000156	they are not a dog for somebody who wants a dog that they can wander down the road and go to the local park and let them off for a lead to play with all the other dogs
YOU1000000035_S0000157	they would be fine when they were puppies but what would happen is gradually that part would become theirs if they went there every day or once a week gradually as they grew up
YOU1000000035_S0000158	that would be their park and so they would consider that everybody within that park were people who needed to abide by certain behavior
YOU1000000035_S0000159	patterns civilized behavior patterns if some stupid dog comes up to it growling and snapping and snarling and biting at its face
YOU1000000035_S0000161	the conga dog will just
YOU1000000035_S0000163	do dog behavior and it will stand completely statue like which is dog language for your behavior is unacceptable please stop
YOU1000000035_S0000164	and if that does not work he will follow through
YOU1000000035_S0000166	in animal behavior patterns
YOU1000000035_S0000167	until it gets to the point where he has to do what animal behavior insists that he must do which is to pick it up and give it a good thumping
YOU1000000035_S0000168	which is not acceptable in today is modern world in today is modern world that will make him a dangerous dog which he does not understand
YOU1000000035_S0000169	because as far as he is concerned he is followed all the patterns you know i have tried i have been very civilized i have said
YOU1000000035_S0000170	do not do that i have said i told you not to do that you know i have followed all the behavior
YOU1000000035_S0000172	it is not just physical strength you need them to know what you want them to do
YOU1000000035_S0000173	when we had our 1st dose they knew that i did not want them to behave in a certain way at a certain place what they did know was
YOU1000000035_S0000174	they had somewhere where they could do that always our dogs have had somewhere where they could guard
YOU1000000035_S0000175	our dogs here we have got a bridle way at the side they guard they run up and down and they shout and they scream if anybody goes by that is what they do
YOU1000000035_S0000176	when we go out from here they know that that behavior is not acceptable
YOU1000000035_S0000177	we do not have a dog barking and growling and screaming in the car and we make that clear from an early age
YOU1000000035_S0000179	they are not a dog that goes around with their sleeves rolled up looking for trouble and they should not be like that and that is not what somebody should be wanting
YOU1000000035_S0000180	they are not aggressive what they are is they are there to take care of you
YOU1000000035_S0000182	they are my heart and soul and they will give you their heart and their soul they do not call back ever there is no half ways they are an all or nothing dog
YOU1000000035_S0000184	and that is the trouble with me i am an all or nothing person
YOU1000000035_S0000185	and that is what i like about them
YOU1000000035_S0000187	i was deeply moved by sheila is stories and found out information i did not previously know such as there being varying types of kangol
YOU1000000035_S0000188	some larger some more large headed some with more toes and some far more aggressive than others
YOU1000000035_S0000189	what was clear though was her deep unwavering love and respect of this breed a breed that she was keen to not have misrepresented
YOU1000000035_S0000190	a breed that would love and look after you with its soul and one that she wanted to be embraced by the world
YOU1000000035_S0000191	she backed up my conclusion that a wolf can kill a kangal but equally if the conditions were right a kangal could kill a wolf
YOU1000000035_S0000192	the walls of turkey and the surrounding areas are much smaller than north american timber walls and this small size would equate for why they are killed from time to time
YOU1000000035_S0000193	but equally it was clear that wolves regularly kill the kangals however what was most important was the dog is role
YOU1000000035_S0000194	as if more flock guardians were used the world around
YOU1000000035_S0000195	then there would be less licensed wolf culls as farmers could then protect their sheep in the fair and natural way
YOU1000000035_S0000196	allowing wolves to coexist in the lands they all once roamed before industrial farming
YOU1000000035_S0000197	sheila also nicely cleared up the kangal versus anatolian shepherd debate and explained why these 2 dog breeds are certainly not the same

YOU1000000038_S0000009	in this week is episode we head up to del mar and check in on the wild
YOU1000000038_S0000011	very 1st scrimmage
YOU1000000038_S0000012	and i would not be surprised if ravens head coach john harbaugh had his own fantasy football draft regular season is right around the corner we will let you know our picks
YOU1000000038_S0000013	and we will head down to snow hill and get our 1st look at this year is eagles team as they took on north dorchester
YOU1000000038_S0000014	but we begin today with a team right here on delmarva that has some high expectations heading into the football season
YOU1000000038_S0000015	queen anne is now they held their 1st scrimmage this year on friday against saint mary is riking now the lions finished last year with a 8 and 3 record overall
YOU1000000038_S0000016	before eventually being bounced in the state tournament in the 1st round now they did lose a few guys from that team but they bring back a lot of key players and it is not just about what they are going to do here early on
YOU1000000038_S0000017	but it is about putting in the work that will pay off towards the end of the year
YOU1000000038_S0000018	it is definitely a work in progress really most of our line is going to be really young we are going to be a bunch of pretty much sophomores and juniors
YOU1000000038_S0000019	so it is just pretty much getting their confidence up and then everything will just kind of mesh together after that
YOU1000000038_S0000021	spencer you know the lions are one of the teams that every other team in the bayside north division actually circles on their calendar so they mean business
YOU1000000038_S0000022	but like this qb said this is a young team and they have to find their comfort level in their scrimmage on friday the lions had some mistakes on both sides of the ball
YOU1000000038_S0000023	the program itself has not won a regional championship in a couple years and for this team to get back to the top of the football chain
YOU1000000038_S0000024	they need to feel comfortable especially since they have some new faces the lions have the athletic ability but we know football is not just about athletic ability spencer it is all about the mental game as well
YOU1000000038_S0000025	i think you are right too i mean you look at they did have a couple of mistakes early on but i actually really liked what i saw from this team and the fact is you are going to have that early on in your 1st few scrimmages those are why those are there to work through that get yourself better
YOU1000000038_S0000026	and what i really was impressed with was bradley how calm and composed he was throughout that interview and throughout the game
YOU1000000038_S0000027	and if you can get that from your senior leadership especially when it is that quarterback you know you are going to have a pretty good chance of winning a lot of ball games especially in the high school games
YOU1000000038_S0000028	so i think they actually have a pretty good thing here moving forward
YOU1000000038_S0000030	he has been there with 4 years with the team
YOU1000000038_S0000031	all right it was scrimmage saturday in delaware sussex central knights played host to the woodbridge raiders and the stephen decatur seahawks
YOU1000000038_S0000032	the knights were doing this all day controlling the game at the line of scrimmage that is the quarterback running down and really having their way with the other teams
YOU1000000038_S0000033	and the seahawks had questions on who would be their number one running back but they got a few contributions from a few guys and look at that guy just go and now the woodbridge showed their ability to make the big play especially this guy
YOU1000000038_S0000035	i think it was the quarterback scrimmages especially for the raiders
YOU1000000038_S0000036	that was .
YOU1000000038_S0000037	this group has actually worked super hard in camp we have tightened the bolts down a little bit in camp from last year and previous years
YOU1000000038_S0000038	and push the kids pretty hard this year i got to tell you they responded we have good numbers out and the kids we are working hard
YOU1000000038_S0000039	and you can see it in her black
YOU1000000038_S0000041	no these are always good when you have those 3 team scrimmages or 4 teams opportunity to really gauge each other against some good competition and the thing that really stood out for me was why i mean we went to their 1st couple practices and there was a lot of questions as to what running back was going to take over for them moving forward
YOU1000000038_S0000042	and the thing is it looks like they have multiple guys that can do it i mean they had a couple guys out there that were really running the ball pretty hard
YOU1000000038_S0000043	and the fact is i mean steven decatur that is they had guys that they were handing the ball off to running hard downhill and they also had a guy that was about £250 and he was laying guys out i mean he was picking up yards you want to talk about falling forward to get the 1st down
YOU1000000038_S0000044	he was definitely getting that done out there from giselle and i feel like moving forward they got a good thing going there it is always nice when you got a couple guys you can hand the ball to
YOU1000000038_S0000045	i think with any team whether it was the seahawks the raiders or the knights the best part about scrimmage is just being able to finally play against someone else
YOU1000000038_S0000046	and i know this scrimmage helped each team get a good measure on how their offense and defense will really perform and no matter who is on the field it is all about who is going to be step up under pressure and make the big plays whether it is a scrimmage or the 1st game of the season
YOU1000000038_S0000047	and as coach knox said the cream usually comes to the top
YOU1000000038_S0000049	and seifert they hosted a 4 team scrimmage yesterday which included parkside jameson bennett and colonel richardson now a strong play for both teams in this thing
YOU1000000038_S0000050	and speaking of strong plays check out this run here by tj hayward i mean just knocking guys out of his way barreling downhill colonel richardson was moving the ball as well in this thing their quarterback sneaks here in the middle up the crease
YOU1000000038_S0000051	making a lot of guys miss he is going to be a got to watch this year parkside on the other hand they were getting it done through the air aaron this one out way downhill devin redding slings that beautiful catch there for completion
YOU1000000038_S0000052	seaford they got it done on defense and i think that is going to be one area where they improved a lot this year made a couple interceptions and it was good to see out of them
YOU1000000038_S0000053	well we were ready we were hyped for it and we all came in with the right intensity so we knew this was the 1st chance we got to actually put full pads on and play against somebody else so we were ready for it
YOU1000000038_S0000054	i think it went very well for us still things to improve on but coming out today and seeing what we had we did a great job out here everybody executed well
YOU1000000038_S0000055	you know spencer actually being out there on saturday felt like each team was actually playing for a championship one team that stood out from the rest of them were the rams and i mean their running game was on point finding the holes evading defenders they could do no wrong in my eyes
YOU1000000038_S0000056	on the other hand one of the teams that made some mistakes on both sides of the ball were the blue jays i spoke to coach darling he said his team is too selfish right now and is trying to get them to be a more cohesive unit and you know the scrimmage is actually going to help them get to that better direction
YOU1000000038_S0000057	absolutely and it is always tough too that is his 1st year at the program so moving forward you kind of need to get that senior leadership and kind of establish yourself so i am sure he will be fine down the stretch but early on that is always tough to go but the thing that really impressed me was parkside i mean they had some guys down the field that were definitely making some plays at the ball
YOU1000000038_S0000058	that passing game looks legit and they have a couple guys too that i feel like you are going to watch out for this year and at the high school level i was a little concerned that they would not be able to have the playmakers and the time to get it out there
YOU1000000038_S0000059	but they found them in space and if they can do that throughout the year i mean this is going to team you are definitely going to watch moving forward giselle as they were a quality quality program
YOU1000000038_S0000060	well how do you feel about it we want to know so reach out to us on facebook or twitter send us a message there

YOU1000000038_S0000065	welcome back well we are still talking some football let me tell you we have got a special special segment for this one
YOU1000000038_S0000066	we have our own trey miles who is a y high alum had a chance to talk to his old coach about the program is direction trey were you tempted to put on some gear and do you miss it
YOU1000000038_S0000068	well i do not exactly miss the 2 a day practices or the indescribable scent of that locker room but of course i do miss the game
YOU1000000038_S0000069	so i stopped by practice and chatted with my former jv coach now varsity head coach pat mcglinchey to see exactly what yi will need to improve upon to return to the bayside dominance
YOU1000000038_S0000070	got my jersey on right now it has been 7 years can you believe that coach
YOU1000000038_S0000071	yeah i can not believe it it feels like yesterday
YOU1000000038_S0000072	3 and 7 was kind of a down year last year according to program standards what will change that this year
YOU1000000038_S0000073	the biggest difference between last year and this year is going to be team unity we stressed it in the weight room all season all off season as soon as the season was over i realized a lot of the mistakes that i made as a head football coach
YOU1000000038_S0000074	i am going to put a lot of the blame on myself it is on my shoulders and i felt like our team was not together they were more about playing for themselves we had great athletes last year
YOU1000000038_S0000075	and we just did not come together and play together
YOU1000000038_S0000076	my man nelson brown will be featured in this offense talk about him and why he excels at what he does
YOU1000000038_S0000077	nelson brown is just one of those phenomenal athletes he is not an athlete that comes around all the time nelson is being looked at by division i aa football schools
YOU1000000038_S0000078	he is a scholarship kid and we are waiting on that for a scholarship morgan state has been really looking hard at him but beside that he goes out there and he is the ultra competitor
YOU1000000038_S0000079	he does not like being on the sideline whether it is in practice or during a game so in a game we are looking at him really carrying the load this year and really being the running back that he can be
YOU1000000038_S0000080	talk about a newcomer that you are expecting that you are really expecting to put some things on tape and really have a good time for you this year
YOU1000000038_S0000081	i would say the newcomer that i am looking forward to the most is raekwon mccarter he is just at every single thing that we could offer he goes to the offseason training the weight room the beach
YOU1000000038_S0000082	wherever we are doing training he is there
YOU1000000038_S0000083	you got a new guy here at corner keiondre causton who when we saw him at the bentay camp honestly in my eyes he was the best corner there talk about him and what this young defense will bring to the table
YOU1000000038_S0000084	yeah our d backs this year are pretty much all new like you said keiondre is one of those guys who is going to try to shut you down a line of scrimmage
YOU1000000038_S0000085	he is very strong he is little but he is very strong and he is very fast and you know we are really excited about all of them
YOU1000000038_S0000087	well saturday waihai made the trip to wildcat country to take on 6 time state champion del mar in a little preseason football action
YOU1000000038_S0000088	there is that man nelson brown he was out on saturday with a shoulder bruise just precautionary he told me he expects to practice on monday there is another star shane leatherberry and he is a veteran and natural born leader of the wildcats i expect those young guys there to look up for him
YOU1000000038_S0000089	we know it is
YOU1000000038_S0000091	but check out what he does on defense
YOU1000000038_S0000092	gets the pick right there he is out on the island by himself and this guy will be a natural born leader one thing i really liked about waihai was their defensive line that right there is terrez savage breaking through and dropping leatherberry for the sack
YOU1000000038_S0000093	i am telling you him and mel morris are 2 studs on the defensive line this play right here by this young man raekwon mccarter is just a fabulous play look at him take it down through the middle and get those defenders out of his way that is just a filthy move excuse me thank you for a touchdown
YOU1000000038_S0000094	this kid is going to be a stud not to be outdone delmar junior dejor brown takes the handoff straight up the middle 60 yards out and he did not even get touched folks he has got some burners he had a great scrimmage as well
YOU1000000038_S0000095	and for del mar coach dave hearn he knows that the preseason is all about figuring his team out
YOU1000000038_S0000096	the 1st week you are hoping just to keep everybody healthy and that 1st scrimmage that is what we did today and to make sure that we have learned something but if you have not got players that are what you thought especially the new guys the ones you are talking about
YOU1000000038_S0000097	then you may have to make adjustments or then you can figure out what do they need and so then we will make adjustments ourselves because we are not just going to plug along if we are struggling in a particular area we will try to make some modifications
YOU1000000038_S0000099	well if you know anything about del mar football you know coach hearn will have that team ready whether he has all freshmen or all seniors there is a reason why he is a 4 time state champion there
YOU1000000038_S0000100	still to come the raiders of woodbridge on the field for some field hockey we will tell you what they are doing to improve upon that 9 6 record from just a year ago do not go anywhere
YOU1000000038_S0000102	my name is david wells inside linebacker for james m bennett and you are watching delmauro sports insider
YOU1000000038_S0000104	welcome back well the fall sports season it is officially underway and that means just one thing to sell it is time for some field hockey i mean woodbridge they got their 1st taste of the preseason action on wednesday when they hosted a 5 team scrimmage
YOU1000000038_S0000105	head coach wheatley is team will be trying to make it to the state tournament after coming up with just one game short a year ago finishing with a 9 6 record that right there was sarah davis putting on the moves from way outside and scoring it just a beautiful goal
YOU1000000038_S0000106	and then just a few minutes later the raiders they were right back at it they found the net one more time this one was from brady keeler with the honors with a beautiful slap shot
YOU1000000038_S0000107	our goal is to get into the tournament and get really far into the tournament and i do not know we have been talking about it for a few years so i am just really excited and it is really important to me
YOU1000000038_S0000109	set those expectations
YOU1000000038_S0000110	yeah definitely when you raise it up there and the fact is i looked at this team and we went in i was talking with coach whealy afterwards they knew they were going to be able to score the ball they knew they had a good opportunity of being a very high scoring team but they did not realize how good they were going to be defensively and they definitely showed that in the scrimmage
YOU1000000038_S0000111	i feel like they are going to be a quality program but what scares me is the fact that they only have 3 seniors and they are going to be relying on a lot of unproven teams that does not mean that they can not do it but the fact is those guys have not had the minutes yet they have not proven they can play at this level so there is still some question marks moving forward
YOU1000000038_S0000112	i mean you are right having only 3 seniors is a little worrisome but sometimes you have to look past that number and see the group as a whole and you know growing pains are actually normal in high school and this team looks ready to step it up to the next level
YOU1000000038_S0000113	like the coach said it is about avoiding mistakes and learning from each game which is key in any sport
YOU1000000038_S0000114	yeah absolutely and by the way congratulations to coach wheatley she actually just got married a couple weeks ago
YOU1000000038_S0000116	and the volleyball season well that is here as well several teams were taking part in their 1st scrimmages of the year on thursday snowhill welcomed north dorchester to town the snowhill eagles will have some high expectations coming in this year
YOU1000000038_S0000117	and as for dorchester well it is a success even having a team on the court i mean the eagles this is the 1st time they have had a program reopening up this year now overall though both teams were pretty pleased with what they saw from their team
YOU1000000038_S0000118	really we are trying to work on the fundamentals the basics again trying to improve some serving some net play and really trying to put together an offense that is going to be a little bit more aggressive than we were last year
YOU1000000038_S0000119	we have got 15 girls out here we kind of tried to go with our most athletic girls and just kind of work with it from there but they are very excited coach jackson and i are very excited so it is always cool to have a new program give the kids some more experiences
YOU1000000038_S0000120	she is absolutely right about that i was thinking about that what a great experience for these guys i mean they are going into the season they are not going to have too much pressure i mean no one is really expecting them to make a run as far as wins
YOU1000000038_S0000121	but just the fact to be a part of a brand new program to get out there on the court and to have a great time with your friends and to learn a new sport and be competitive with it i mean this is something they will be able to say for the rest of their lives that they were part of the very 1st team there
YOU1000000038_S0000122	and i really i mean i can not imagine what that feeling must be like
YOU1000000038_S0000123	but you should that sounds like us it is like the beginning we started from the beginning i remember when i was a part of a water polo team at my high school that was only in its 2nd year it is all about patience when you are in a startup program and the eagles will learn so much of that this season
YOU1000000038_S0000124	and spencer one of the things they have to also see is being able to build that roster and see who is actually going to be able to perform well on the court
YOU1000000038_S0000125	yeah absolutely moving forward that will be a great test of just what this team is going to have
YOU1000000038_S0000126	alright and so many games on the eastern shore tell us which ones we should go to like our facebook page 47 abcsports and after you do that go follow us on our twitter account at 47 abcsports
YOU1000000038_S0000127	and even if it is a selfie or a view at a sporting event send us those too you might see them in our next show
YOU1000000038_S0000128	yeah absolutely and we are going to take another quick commercial break but do not go anywhere we are going to talk a little fantasy football after the break what players can make or break this year is team we will discuss
YOU1000000038_S0000129	this is monica wheatley for the woodbridge field hockey team and you are watching the delmarva sports insider
YOU1000000038_S0000131	welcome back well we are going to talk a little fantasy football now guys and there is always that one guy that is flying under the radar that can totally change your team giselle who you got this year
YOU1000000038_S0000132	my sleeper pick is actually someone i went to high school with t y hilton from the colts a wide receiver and he was as impressive as andrew luck is number one option last season after the injury to pro kane reggie wayne
YOU1000000038_S0000133	i mean just look at those stats from last season hilton had 1083 yards and 5 touchdowns he is speedy and sure wayne is coming back this season but i think hilton will put up big numbers this season
YOU1000000038_S0000134	and give me some major points that i need
YOU1000000038_S0000135	yeah well my sleeper i did not go to high school with but i am going with e j manuel manuel missed 6 games last season with an hyperextended knee but he has got some serious weapons now c j spiller fred jackson
YOU1000000038_S0000136	they traded up in the draft for sammy watkins he is a monster they add robert woods and speedster marquise goodwin and they got mike williams on and i mean there is a lot of weapons there a lot of young weapons but they are very talented he is undrafted in most leagues you know
YOU1000000038_S0000137	so i think you can make a case to be a good sleeper pick i definitely do you can definitely get him late in the draft
YOU1000000038_S0000138	i think there is a big reason why he is undrafted in most leagues i am sleeping on manuel moving forward
YOU1000000038_S0000139	but the guy i am going with i mean tight ends are always hard to find i think ladarius green is going to have a big year for these chargers in this year
YOU1000000038_S0000140	i mean he did not exactly have amazing numbers last year i get it just 13 catches and 3 tds but he is starting to take more and more reps with the ones philip rivers loves his tight ends and i think he is going to get a lot of balls thrown his way this year
YOU1000000038_S0000141	0 you think so
YOU1000000038_S0000142	i think so
YOU1000000038_S0000143	i know
YOU1000000038_S0000144	well have you ever had someone let you down
YOU1000000038_S0000145	just when you needed them let us talk about the bus the worst fantasy football thing that could ever happen is a bus
YOU1000000038_S0000146	who are you guys going with today
YOU1000000038_S0000147	drum roll i got gronk i know someone out there also has rob gronkowski as their bust i know this guy is coming off an acl injury and he is no adrian preveason let us be real the unlucky number here is 14 and no that is not the number of touchdowns
YOU1000000038_S0000148	he scored that is how many weeks of football he is missed due to injury i understand that he is one of the top tight ends in the league when he was extremely healthy remember extremely healthy scoring 42 touchdowns in 50 career regular season games
YOU1000000038_S0000149	he is also had 8 career surgeries i just do not see the spark in gronkowski how much can he really physically overcome this season the game is just getting even harder
YOU1000000038_S0000150	i do not know anytime you got brady i feel like you are going to be all right
YOU1000000038_S0000152	all right sorry not sorry eagles fans but i am going with nick foles you all know what you are saying nick foles had amazing numbers last season which is exactly why i am staying away from him teams now have film on them and they are prepared for chip kelly is offense
YOU1000000038_S0000153	plus he lost to sean jackson he looked lost when i was up there at eagles camp guys but so did all the other eagles quarterbacks but i am not saying do not draft the eagles especially sean mccoy
YOU1000000038_S0000154	but i do not think foles is going to put up half the numbers he put up last year
YOU1000000038_S0000155	so it made a lot of people angry here
YOU1000000038_S0000157	i definitely going to stay away from though is eric decker i mean this guy is definitely going to cost some people from winning their leagues i get it i mean he had some good numbers in denver but the fact is that offense is ridiculous there
YOU1000000038_S0000158	and a number that you need to know is that guy dropped 30% of his catchable balls i mean he has not got good hands he does not have good breakaway speed and i just do not feel like anyone should go near him at all
YOU1000000038_S0000160	next week when we bring in chris russell from espn 980 in dc to talk about the redskins and coming up after the break one of our favorite segments crazy catches dives and stops our plays of the week coming up you will not want to miss it

YOU1000000040_S0000000	we are in istanbul turkey
YOU1000000040_S0000001	the food culture here will blow your mind we are so excited to be filming a bunch of food videos
YOU1000000040_S0000002	let us get boot hunting
YOU1000000040_S0000003	istanbul has an exciting and vibrant food scene this city is diverse heritage is reflected in its incredible food culture in this 5 part series we are going to show you some delicious local turkish food
YOU1000000040_S0000004	and eat where the locals eat this is our 3rd video of the series and we are hunting down the popular snack of lamajun eating a kebab trenched in browned butter
YOU1000000040_S0000005	and visiting a historic sweet shop for turkey is famous turkish delight you do not want to miss this video get ready for some mouth watering food
YOU1000000040_S0000006	i am thomas
YOU1000000040_S0000007	and i am sheena and we are chasing a plate
YOU1000000040_S0000008	we hope you are hungry let us eat
YOU1000000040_S0000010	we are starting our food hunting day over on the asian side of istanbul and the 1st thing we are going to eat is a thing called lahmacun so lahmacun you will often see described as turkish pizza but it is nothing like it
YOU1000000040_S0000011	it has its really own unique identity and it is super delicious
YOU1000000040_S0000013	so this is lahmacun now i reckon it is called turkish pizza because it is round it is made up of dough and the dough has got some topping on it but it is really different in my opinion
YOU1000000040_S0000014	they take a small clump of dough and they roll that dough out until it is really thin paper thin and then they smear it with a thin minced mixture of lamb parsley i think there is a little bit of chili on there
YOU1000000040_S0000015	and then they pop it into a really blazing hot wood fired oven now you can see that the dough is just perfectly blistered and then it has got that whole minced meat mixture on the top
YOU1000000040_S0000016	but it is so thin that you can see like parts of the dough coming through so the way that it is served is it comes with fresh parsley and some lemon so what you do is you grab some parsley pop it in the middle
YOU1000000040_S0000018	and then give a little bit of squeeze of lemon over the top of it and then you take the whole thing and you roll it up so you would not think that the dough is very pliable but it is
YOU1000000040_S0000019	it is like beautifully soft all right let us give this thing a taste
YOU1000000040_S0000021	that is so good it is beautiful the dough is so soft but it has the perfect amount of crispiness it is almost a little bit floury but in a pleasant way
YOU1000000040_S0000022	and the minced meat mixture the lamb it has got so much flavor and there is just enough on there there is the perfect balance of meat and dough
YOU1000000040_S0000023	this is good my initial bite did not get any of that parsley in there so let us go for another one
YOU1000000040_S0000025	that fresh parsley imparts such a beautiful vibrant flavor and then that tiny squeeze and hint of lemon juice adds an acidity to that bite 0 man this is so good
YOU1000000040_S0000027	that was a great start to this food hunting day do not let anyone tell you that dish is like a pizza it is nothing like a pizza stands out on its own for its own reasons and it is incredible we are on to find some more food now
YOU1000000040_S0000029	our next stop is taking us down near the coast and how beautiful is this city so i am going to show you some shots of this beautiful coastline before we start eating again
YOU1000000040_S0000031	i am really excited about our next stop we are going to be eating a thing called an iskandar kebab now kebab is like a common term for meat that is fashioned onto a skewer and then grilled and this kebab is made up of a plate of meat and
YOU1000000040_S0000032	tomato sauce creamy yogurt and brown butter it looks insane and the restaurant which is just over there
YOU1000000040_S0000033	owned and operated by the family of the man who created this kebab way back in 1867 so there is a real history
YOU1000000040_S0000034	with this restaurant let us go and eat
YOU1000000040_S0000036	our kebab has just been delivered and this is unreal and it is pretty different to what you expect when you get some form of kebab here in turkey so normally there is bread around the outside but in this case there is a little bit of bread hiding underneath
YOU1000000040_S0000037	but it is all about the meat so all of this lamb is just piled on top and then to go with it a ginormous dollop of yogurt
YOU1000000040_S0000038	some grilled chili peppers and then some fresh tomato and on top of that meat is browned butter so that is going to just make it super rich and creamy so they bring over the big pan of browned butter and
YOU1000000040_S0000039	pour it all over the meat and you can actually see the tomato sauce that sheena mentioned as well so you can see the slight orange color in there and then look at the butter just glistening on that meat so
YOU1000000040_S0000040	let us just grab some meat get some bread from under there as well a whole lot of yogurt and get right on in
YOU1000000040_S0000042	0 wow
YOU1000000040_S0000044	wow that is good
YOU1000000040_S0000045	wow the meat is so soft it is not being charred right down so it does not have like the crunchy bits you often get with this type of meat it is just really soft
YOU1000000040_S0000046	it is quite salty it has got a beautiful saltiness
YOU1000000040_S0000048	and that butter it just sort of coats your mouth i was expecting maybe it to be a little bit buttery a little bit oily on the top of my mouth
YOU1000000040_S0000049	not at all it is super rich and juicy i am going to get some more but this time i just want a couple of bits of meat so i do not want the yogurt or the bread the yogurt flavor was very strong so the sourness of the yogurt
YOU1000000040_S0000050	i think overtook from the meat flavor of it
YOU1000000040_S0000052	0 yeah 0 that is good
YOU1000000040_S0000054	0 the butter flavor really really came home that time so it has got quite a sweetness which i guess is coming from that tomato sauce 0 this is really good
YOU1000000040_S0000055	i am going to make up a mouthful here with the flatbread the lamb and also some chili pepper and the bread has gone quite soft because of that tomato sauce and the butter and then that yogurt in there
YOU1000000040_S0000057	mmmm mmmm that is really good it is very rich from that butter creamy from that yogurt but then you can really taste the flavor of the meat that is delicious and we are also washing it down with
YOU1000000040_S0000058	drink called shara and it is a slightly fermented grape juice sweetened grape juice and this is sort of the traditional accompaniment
YOU1000000040_S0000060	cold sweet refreshing a tiny little bit bubbly is the perfect thing to go with this
YOU1000000040_S0000062	look how all that butter is just sitting in the bottom of the plate now so i am going to grab some more meat in it really soggy bread get it right through that butter super oily
YOU1000000040_S0000064	now i can really taste the butter in my 1st bites i could taste the butter but it was not a big flavor that is a super bold flavor
YOU1000000040_S0000065	really rich creamy and super oily so there is oils from the meat the tomato sauce and from the butter so you are getting this combination of different oiliness down there
YOU1000000040_S0000066	and it works a treat just hoeing into this plate it is really really good
YOU1000000040_S0000068	no day in istanbul is complete without a ferry ride or 2 so now we are catching the ferry from the asian side back over to europe where we are going to continue our food hunt
YOU1000000040_S0000070	we have made it back to the european side of istanbul and next up we are going to have an absolute classic snack here in turkey and that is turkish delight now you will see this stuff piled up all over the city in the windows of shops
YOU1000000040_S0000071	massive piles of colorful turkish light but we are not going to one of those places we are going to go to this really traditional place here that has been around since 1926 you will not see those vivid colors here from food coloring
YOU1000000040_S0000072	it is all natural and this stuff is really really good let us go grab something
YOU1000000040_S0000074	we are loaded up with our bags of turkish delight i wanted to stay in that sweet shop forever it had such a beautiful old world feel about it and the staff was so friendly they had these gorgeous huge candy jars for
YOU1000000040_S0000075	filled with sweets tons of turkish delight and they even had big pots of homemade jam so you can take your own jam jars from home
YOU1000000040_S0000077	fill it up 0 it was a beautiful spot we are now going to head off and find ourselves a turkish coffee to wash these babies down
YOU1000000040_S0000079	it is a holiday here in istanbul today so the coffee place we wanted to go to is sadly shut it is known as one of the best places to get a turkish coffee here in istanbul so that is why we wanted to go to that particular place
YOU1000000040_S0000080	so we have scrapped the coffee idea we are going to do the next best thing here in turkey and that is tea they have these brilliant little street side cafes just little mini cafes right on the footpath we are going to grab a tea there
YOU1000000040_S0000082	we have sat ourselves down at a small table at this tea cafe ordered up a couple of glasses of turkish tea and we are going to crack into this turkish delight
YOU1000000040_S0000083	so turkish delight in turkish is lokum and if you have never had lokum before it is like a jelly like sweet almost like a gummy and it is made out of corn flour and water and sugar
YOU1000000040_S0000084	and then they dust it with icing sugar once it is cooled and we ordered rose pistachio and mint flavor and we have had this before and we know that it is amazing so i have got the pistachio here
YOU1000000040_S0000086	mmmm mmmm it is beautiful the flavor of the pistachios is really strong so a really earthy flavor and the pistachios still have a bit of crunch they are not
YOU1000000040_S0000088	soft they are quite crunchy and then the texture of the turkish delight or the lokum is really sort of a little bit sticky tiny bit chewy but very soft and it is very sweet
YOU1000000040_S0000089	so this tea is going to go perfectly with it so they like to serve their tea with sugar the turk so i am going to pop the 2 sugars in because i find that the tea can be quite strong
YOU1000000040_S0000090	and quite bitter so we will just give that a bit of a stir
YOU1000000040_S0000092	alright let us have a sip of this chai or tea
YOU1000000040_S0000094	0 yeah that is really good so it is very strong quite bitter and i do not know if thomas mentioned but drinking tea is like a national pastime in turkey people stop and have a cup of tea like all throughout the day right from the early morning right through
YOU1000000040_S0000095	to the evening late late at night and both of us have really gotten into this pastime it is really nice to just take a moment out of your day sit watch the world go by sip your tea
YOU1000000040_S0000096	and this is a perfect combination so you have got the really sweet turkish delight and then the bitter tea to wash it down
YOU1000000040_S0000098	i am going to grab a piece of mint turkish delight and this is my favorite flavor for turkish delight by a long way i have got great memories of turkish delight as a young boy eating it because it was a bit of a treat in my family both my parents and
YOU1000000040_S0000099	my auntie and uncle came to istanbul in the 70s they got a taste for turkish delight back then so it was always the treat thing we had on our family dinner table for after a meal let us try this mint
YOU1000000040_S0000101	0 this is delicious 0 the flavor just builds you know when it is natural mint flavor because it comes on slowly and like sheena said we have had this turkish delight before and i know that this mint flavor just
YOU1000000040_S0000102	evolves and evolves and even 10 minutes later it is still in your mouth incredibly strong that is a beautiful beautiful flavor and i love that it is not bright green like i talked about before
YOU1000000040_S0000103	when you see turkish light in the shops on the main roads for tourist trips bright greens bright pinks for the rose one these are not like that at all they are just very subtly colored little flecks of mint in the mint one
YOU1000000040_S0000104	and the taste is absolutely incredible so if you are here in istanbul you have definitely got to have a taste of turkish delight and make sure you get it from this place or one of the few places like this one but this place does an incredible version of turkish delight
YOU1000000040_S0000105	they are really good
YOU1000000040_S0000107	another great day of eating here in istanbul and we are finishing with one of the turkish delight places behind us that i have talked about a couple of times so the colorful stuff piled up on

YOU1000000044_S0000017	maybe you can tell the rest of the audience who is not familiar with why you are doing that
YOU1000000044_S0000018	because bottle caps has told me that i should shave my beard and i would look 20 years younger and i was telling him i have a wife who thoroughly enjoys this beard
YOU1000000044_S0000019	i do i do see you can see that
YOU1000000044_S0000020	and has
YOU1000000044_S0000021	you are already starting getting crazy
YOU1000000044_S0000022	that is right the party is already started
YOU1000000044_S0000024	so yeah so i appreciated the feedback my sister actually would slide with you well she is always wanted me to get rid of it
YOU1000000044_S0000025	had it most of my life actually go to i recently just shaved i had a full winter beard he was a fellow canadian understand not for the winter months and
YOU1000000044_S0000026	but i always had some sort of facial hair except for 2 years 23 years i guess when i worked in saskatchewan hauling crude oil
YOU1000000044_S0000027	because of the fire restrictions to be able to wear a mask in case of emergency you are not allowed to have any facial hair except for a mustache so
YOU1000000044_S0000028	yes i am forgetting he is reminding me about the about the camera because i am used to having it on my computer and now it is between the both of us and
YOU1000000044_S0000029	so i always had a clean shaven face during that time and it was probably one of the more depressing parts of my life i liked my job but it just never felt like me
YOU1000000044_S0000030	so it is it was one of the 1st things i did as soon as i stopped working at that we moved back to montreal was to grow my facial hair again i do not think i have ever gone without it since i
YOU1000000044_S0000031	yeah maybe once or twice i think
YOU1000000044_S0000032	after a butt shave job i would just shave and start over again but it was very temporarily
YOU1000000044_S0000033	yeah it is a funny tidbit actually before we went to saskatchewan you had long hair
YOU1000000044_S0000034	very long hair
YOU1000000044_S0000035	long hair and before that he had very long hair like you can not even see how long it was
YOU1000000044_S0000036	that was a different time
YOU1000000044_S0000037	so yeah it has gone through different phases but i love beard i do not know
YOU1000000044_S0000038	i do not know just something about it i just like it i mean i like it when you shave it off too but it is just that forest caveman thing going on
YOU1000000044_S0000039	yes xenia does have a thing for the bit of the cave in on 4 streets i have
YOU1000000044_S0000040	viking caveman mix i would say i guess
YOU1000000044_S0000041	yep and the funny part is we had a viking wedding and i think that is one of the shortest my facial hair and beard and the hair actually ever was
YOU1000000044_S0000042	yeah but i i wanted the way he is right now that is my favorite
YOU1000000044_S0000043	yeah

YOU1000000044_S0000145	we are doing another one this week like i said i want to start we are going to still keep doing videos but we want to have kind of a photograph series as well
YOU1000000044_S0000146	i am just like we are good the next one we are going to be doing is here i will bring this up is jungfrau which is the highest point in europe and
YOU1000000044_S0000147	i just put up a wiki page right here just so you can take a quick look at it and this is the highest point actually in europe and you go by train and
YOU1000000044_S0000148	and the train climbs up to about 3 quarters of the the top and from there you switch over to another train cogwheel of course and
YOU1000000044_S0000149	which takes you right to the very top the last part going through is a tunnel through one of the peaks and when you arrive at the top you are at a lookout point that is 11371 feet
YOU1000000044_S0000151	it is amazing i was in switzerland and was tired from my trip and almost did not go and thank you to my lovely wife who convinced me that i was crazy to be there and not go through with it
YOU1000000044_S0000152	was probably one of the most amazing places i had ever seen in my life i
YOU1000000044_S0000153	so that will be the next one that is coming up i am probably looking at them i do not know maybe monday at this point i guess would be the

YOU1000000044_S0000289	
YOU1000000044_S0000291	larry i am a fisherman too 0 we are get lots of fishermen in here and
YOU1000000044_S0000293	brother doing do you have facebook
YOU1000000044_S0000295	anything that we can message you at
YOU1000000044_S0000296	yeah it is just to send you a link that then that is all you will have to do is click on the link and you will be hooked up which i have been on youtube for 4 years and now going on 5 since january and
YOU1000000044_S0000297	13th 2015 wow so you definitely been around for a while
YOU1000000044_S0000299	if you watch my last video i made and there is no editing cuts in it
YOU1000000044_S0000300	somebody is attention lots a fast editing or a fast editing is
YOU1000000044_S0000301	something 0 cuts in which is better to hold somebody is attention
YOU1000000044_S0000302	fast or something just smooth
YOU1000000044_S0000303	okay the question into it it really depends what the message is you want to tell
YOU1000000044_S0000304	i mean yeah i do some very fast editing but i also if you take my 16 again for a day videos are a lot of them where i grew up in the gasp a
YOU1000000044_S0000305	
YOU1000000044_S0000307	and they should not because it will absolutely destroy the mood you do a lot of outdoor scenery and you are not going to be able to do it
YOU1000000044_S0000308	and it also depends on your music to what you want to do my last one i did with the european countries i mean they are very slow panning and
YOU1000000044_S0000309	but you will notice when it gets to croatia it goes and turns the side well that is a white flash i put in and then i rotate i forget now maybe 25 degrees
YOU1000000044_S0000310	but that is just for a transformation to follow with the beat yes smooth is great lots of people that that is it depends what you want so what kind of a story you want to tell
YOU1000000044_S0000311	it is amazing how you can take one piece of footage grab 10 different tracks of different genres different tempos
YOU1000000044_S0000312	and completely tell a story that would have made would have you would have never even guessed of making just by following the beat
YOU1000000044_S0000313	and also to it depends on the editor what they are comfortable with i mean i some people it is like guitar players when i was in bands and
YOU1000000044_S0000314	there is some guys whether the song was 10 beats a minute i know that is extreme i am just for the point of conversation
YOU1000000044_S0000315	or 200 beats a minute they play the same wiry fast screaming solo over to it
YOU1000000044_S0000316	for me it just did not make any sense but to them that is just what they wanted to do so
YOU1000000044_S0000318	but i find for what you do your type of videos and the type of music you go with smoother is definitely speaks more of what you do and they look great
YOU1000000044_S0000320	dune says that he has facebook dune if you can just go over to our facebook pusha studios is that one or
YOU1000000044_S0000321	yeah it does not matter

YOU1000000044_S0000385	definitely it is great to see more train guys to get over there it is not for us it is for everybody to grow in the community of youtube and
YOU1000000044_S0000386	and just search on youtube for hashtag i am a creator and go over and put one of your videos or 2 of them into the playlist and

YOU1000000044_S0000389	well by the way we had the malware man 82
YOU1000000044_S0000390	0 he is in here i was watching for you
YOU1000000044_S0000392	hello
YOU1000000044_S0000393	and 0 and just a quick note benjamin just is one short of 300 so everybody please go over to benjamin chavez is channel
YOU1000000044_S0000394	and hit that button so you can get the round number
YOU1000000044_S0000396	there we go there we are back on
YOU1000000044_S0000398	i was going to when brother doom was on but i will save that for when he comes on about the gas pipe
YOU1000000044_S0000399	okay so our halos on heavens we feel weird about putting our own video on the i am creator playlist
YOU1000000044_S0000400	no the thing is that you should
YOU1000000044_S0000401	put your own and then put somebody else is
YOU1000000044_S0000402	the best practice i think was 2 videos now yeah
YOU1000000044_S0000403	2 videos that you think are going to be good for catching attention and letting people know what you are about
YOU1000000044_S0000404	put it on it is like advertising it is free advertising you do not want to be shy advertising you want to be advertising
YOU1000000044_S0000405	but also we are helping each other the same time so it is a win win for everybody and so i think that is a big thing
YOU1000000044_S0000406	so yeah that is what they were doing never putting up one or 2 of their own especially if you are just starting there and
YOU1000000044_S0000407	then watch a bunch of people is and you see somebody that is not on there yet definitely i want a couple of theirs like one or 2 from as many people as possible and
YOU1000000044_S0000408	yes definitely and then remember again it is a co op as andrew said it is for everybody so do not be shy just do it
YOU1000000044_S0000409	you know more men 82 is from prince edward island canada i
YOU1000000044_S0000410	well come on we love your province

YOU1000000044_S0000474	but i am originally from latvia which is the baltic states in northern eastern europe
YOU1000000044_S0000476	so a little bit of european and a little bit of canadian based in montreal
YOU1000000044_S0000477	that is right a good mix
YOU1000000044_S0000478	yeah a great mix
YOU1000000044_S0000479	yeah exactly
YOU1000000044_S0000480	a shout out to that is how i roll they are 3 away from 550
YOU1000000044_S0000481	0
YOU1000000044_S0000482	if anybody has not subscribed yet please go over that is how i roll
YOU1000000044_S0000483	we showed this last night just to show you where xenia is from originally
YOU1000000044_S0000484	excuse me so this is a map of europe of course and there is latvia and that is the capital riga where she was raised and
YOU1000000044_S0000485	and pusha the town that we named our business after
YOU1000000044_S0000486	now we laugh last night because i did get it it is tricky to find it is a small little town there is pusha
YOU1000000044_S0000487	and this is the town that we named our business after because that is where her mom grew up
YOU1000000044_S0000488	it is roughly about 45 kilometers from the russian border a beautiful place i absolutely adore it there
YOU1000000044_S0000489	let us see if i can find
YOU1000000044_S0000491	it is kind of tricky to show pictures now i got it last night for the road but it is very white on my screen because of the lights so i might not be able to see it
YOU1000000044_S0000492	but we will give it a try anyways well here we will just do one on the road here
YOU1000000044_S0000494	now i got thud in my way so i am just going to bring this up a little bit bear with me
YOU1000000044_S0000496	close this and all my youtube advertisements are getting in the way but that is okay
YOU1000000044_S0000497	just
YOU1000000044_S0000499	that is a bit of the scenery and it is gorgeous over there we do still have some property over there
YOU1000000044_S0000500	in it just up this road we can go for a little walk drive a you to google drive if you want to call it that and
YOU1000000044_S0000501	as you can see it reminds me a lot of some of the people here that are from canada or maybe familiar it reminds me a bit of new brunswick except it is mostly pine trees instead of spruce and
YOU1000000044_S0000503	but a lot of the same kind of rolling rolling hills not very unmounted
YOU1000000044_S0000504	i thought well there is only one mountain and that is literally is 300 meters high and
YOU1000000044_S0000506	but still an amazingly beautiful place 0 i think i found it
YOU1000000044_S0000508	korean
YOU1000000044_S0000510	over here
YOU1000000044_S0000512	and this is her mom is family home and right over here this is the new house they are building in front actually but it was right at this spot
YOU1000000044_S0000514	so yeah no it is a beautiful place not a lot of travelers i kind of stand out when i am there and
YOU1000000044_S0000515	lot means in a very very hard language to speak there is only 170 people around in the world i believe i are 20 let us speak and
YOU1000000044_S0000516	yeah
YOU1000000044_S0000517	it is considered an endangered language i was learning russian because of course as an ex soviet country you can get by with russian in most places
YOU1000000044_S0000518	there is from the side and here is where the stork is that i always like to see when i go over to the stork is nest and
YOU1000000044_S0000519	so which is cool because almost every house does have a nest and the thing is like the size of a 45 gallon drum
YOU1000000044_S0000520	but we actually stay in the new house when we were visiting the last time and a stork landed on the roof and they were all excited and said that is a sign of good luck
YOU1000000044_S0000521	because it means that the who is ever in the house was probably going to have a child we already have 3 so i informed my wife there was no way i was staying in the house that night
YOU1000000044_S0000522	so
YOU1000000044_S0000523	i would honestly say it is enough
YOU1000000044_S0000524	yeah yeah we have done our part so
YOU1000000044_S0000525	jada deva says that he uses google earth all the time they love it
YOU1000000044_S0000526	there is a game i always play well i played for a week and then i get too obsessed with it and have to back off for a bit and
YOU1000000044_S0000527	and it is called geoguessr
YOU1000000044_S0000529	and it is google maps but you can pick like either the european union or the united states canada there is tons of maps that are already made
YOU1000000044_S0000530	and it drops you off in the middle of nowhere and you have to guess where you are
YOU1000000044_S0000531	you can walk as i was just doing a minute ago through it but you cannot zoom out enough to see which country you are into you can always see where you are at and
YOU1000000044_S0000532	and it is really cool like i love doing the europe one because you got a guest by the language on the signs trucks passing and
YOU1000000044_S0000533	and then you you the points are determined you start off with 5000 and
YOU1000000044_S0000534	and they start deducting for a point i believe it works for every kilometer that you are away from the exact point
YOU1000000044_S0000535	and it is not like you just pick the country you got to pick the area where you are into but anybody who loves google maps it really makes it a lot funner and
YOU1000000044_S0000536	and this is where i am from well i am from the united states
YOU1000000044_S0000537	here is montreal here and i am from what they call the gasp a and this is like that thumb that sticks out from quebec over top of new brunswick and of course me in the lower side and
YOU1000000044_S0000538	then on above it is this where the saint lawrence seaway comes in into the great lakes
YOU1000000044_S0000540	i got it i got it 0 and you went up to do the +0 you okay okay i see what happened you went to add probably because the mic is right beside it
YOU1000000044_S0000541	0 okay

YOU1000000044_S0000558	most definitely as very entertaining the people are great sports that she picks up i think it is one of your favorite channels i would say and
YOU1000000044_S0000559	yo yes my god yeah i sing along i literally sing along
YOU1000000044_S0000560	this is true she is not making this up i have heard her so i can vote for that
YOU1000000044_S0000561	yeah that is true mauer mann is from edmundston
YOU1000000044_S0000562	0 when we travel home we always go by new brunswick that is why i was curious and we always go by edmundson and
YOU1000000044_S0000563	along the 185 and then intel which is number 2 i believe it is if i am not mistaken it is so amazing to have you here that is great
YOU1000000044_S0000565	
YOU1000000044_S0000567	one of the big land one of the big attractions on the gaspe because it is a small town it is all coastal fishing communities mostly
YOU1000000044_S0000569	this is one of the most famous of the place and this usually represents the province of quebec a lot of times
YOU1000000044_S0000570	when they do the different visuals from all the provinces and it is called percy rock and
YOU1000000044_S0000571	and it is this rock that literally was they figure moved about 80 kilometers during the ice age you can see in proportion to the buildings here and
YOU1000000044_S0000573	it is one of the most beautifully beautiful places and it is heavily for photographed and
YOU1000000044_S0000574	ancient you feel like you have just traveled back in time every time you see it it is incredible and
YOU1000000044_S0000575	i am just looking to see if there is any other really great pictures of it and there is a hole in the rock of course
YOU1000000044_S0000576	which there is a small ferry that does ferry tourist boats that drive right through the hole
YOU1000000044_S0000577	and the piece that is beside it was once connected but over time has fallen apart and eventually that is what will happen of course to the other one as well and
YOU1000000044_S0000578	there is a huge bird sanctuary there you can just see the corner of it right here called bonaventure island
YOU1000000044_S0000579	and it is monitored by i believe it is mcgill university from montreal and
YOU1000000044_S0000580	another perspective of it from the backside just to show you the size of it it is it is colossal
YOU1000000044_S0000582	but it is definitely there is a place that if you are ever looking for somewhere off the beaten path
YOU1000000044_S0000583	that is friendly it is all that you can do the course of both you can easily do it in a day but you would drive yourself crazy and
YOU1000000044_S0000584	you give yourself 34 days and you will see varied you know
YOU1000000044_S0000586	3 different countries i would say almost i would i would say that is the only country that is
YOU1000000044_S0000587	yes
YOU1000000044_S0000588	because they do not have any in common the north side has some of the oldest rocks in the world black worn down
YOU1000000044_S0000589	but an amazing feeling as the saint lawrence seaway comes in on the lower side here is a lot more closer to red rock that you would find for instance in prince edward island
YOU1000000044_S0000590	but not as red as theirs so it is not so oxidized
YOU1000000044_S0000591	and then where i would live for instance where you come to the park following that river which is nothing but trees and some of the highest mountains in quebec and
YOU1000000044_S0000592	which of course are all part of the appalachians that run all the way down through the south of the united states
YOU1000000044_S0000593	we are all connected yeah so there is just some of the photos from it there is some from the island the bird sanctuary
YOU1000000044_S0000595	can you check the microphone again please
YOU1000000044_S0000596	again
YOU1000000044_S0000597	no just go check
YOU1000000044_S0000598	yeah it is good this time
YOU1000000044_S0000599	okay just a 2nd just hang on the railroad man says he is on let us try to connect him

YOU1000000044_S0000679	0 man that is beautiful i love that it kind of reminds me of venice almost
YOU1000000044_S0000680	i know that is probably not actually venice but it looks similar when you think about it
YOU1000000044_S0000682	there so other people can see too
YOU1000000044_S0000683	0 okay
YOU1000000044_S0000684	i can see it clearly

YOU1000000044_S0000688	0 no never mind it is coming in clear it is coming in clear 0 whoa okay now it is showing my face okay that is a bit of an issue when you think about it
YOU1000000044_S0000690	noah the other year we were talking about last night the pictures behind me we have a picture from every country that i have visited
YOU1000000044_S0000691	some of us to get some together and some of my own and
YOU1000000044_S0000692	but the ones behind me there is the 12 of them that was my 1st ever time i traveled for 2 weeks mostly by train across europe
YOU1000000044_S0000693	0 wow
YOU1000000044_S0000695	what is up
YOU1000000044_S0000696	i have never traveled the country by train i have been on plenty of scenic railroads and whatnot but i have never been on a legit cross country passenger train run
YOU1000000044_S0000697	i have always wanted to do that i know canada has some very beautiful scenery and they still use vintage passenger equipment i think from the 50s and 60s
YOU1000000044_S0000698	some of them yeah that they have been monitored monitor modern modified i think thank you and
YOU1000000044_S0000699	but yeah they do still have some of the engines still running in that and there is also the more expensive one maybe bottle caps can help me with the name of it and
YOU1000000044_S0000700	i think it is the canadian i know that is one of their trains that still uses the vintage passenger car fleet
YOU1000000044_S0000701	yeah but that is still part of the via real one but there is another privatized one and it runs from calgary to vancouver and
YOU1000000044_S0000702	0 wow
YOU1000000044_S0000703	and it stops at all the fairmont hotels like all they have the 5 star hotels every night and and
YOU1000000044_S0000704	i know they are canadian actually
YOU1000000044_S0000705	i know they stopped i think at a few of the chateaus that were built by the canadian pacific i could be wrong i could be wrong
YOU1000000044_S0000706	
YOU1000000044_S0000708	but yeah i did like i said in the stream chat i have been wanting to try and do an interview about my channel for a while now
YOU1000000044_S0000709	i actually tried to do 2 self interviews i really do not think they were very good in my opinion
YOU1000000044_S0000710	this is an honor for me okay keep that in mind
YOU1000000044_S0000711	0 my god well it is an honor for us to have you here

YOU1000000044_S0000721	0 also here i am going to send you guys the link to my stream because .
YOU1000000044_S0000722	i included you all is channel in the description for the stream right now it is still live for me
YOU1000000044_S0000723	okay
YOU1000000044_S0000724	and it is at the very bottom of the list my apologies no problem sometimes i included a channel here or there that even though it is not in the stream i figured it is too good not to include
YOU1000000044_S0000725	right
YOU1000000044_S0000726	when i saw you all is video where you all filmed the wind turbine train which i still think is very well done
YOU1000000044_S0000727	thank you
YOU1000000044_S0000728	that is what got me interested in you all is channel and i must say you all is work is truly phenomenal it is some of the most incredible video work i have seen
YOU1000000044_S0000729	0 thank you i appreciate that you are too kind
YOU1000000044_S0000730	yeah it is that is that train was filmed in the gas bay where i grew up where i showed in the map a while ago and
YOU1000000044_S0000731	and we were home on vacation and how the train thing started was i have always liked trains but i wanted something that could do with my my middle aged
YOU1000000044_S0000732	and my middle one is now 11 he was 10 at the time and i just wanted something i could do with him and i just wanted to be able to do something with him
YOU1000000044_S0000733	and i wanted to keep shooting stuff it is hard with video because it is hard to find things that are interesting sometimes and
YOU1000000044_S0000734	and that is when i finally decided to try the trains with him so he would come out with me all the time and and
YOU1000000044_S0000735	he was a good supporter we all get into it he gets me you know he gets to know it it is a good way to spend time together
YOU1000000044_S0000736	so long story short we were in the gas bay and the nice thing about that train is that up until a couple years ago it was an active railway via was going through there and
YOU1000000044_S0000737	prior to that was the cn they had already privatized the freight but then there was a problem with one of the trestles and therefore they shut down all passenger
YOU1000000044_S0000738	so now you have to go to the town of new brunswick camelton up camelton in the province of new brunswick just to be able to get a passenger train which is an hour away from where i live and
YOU1000000044_S0000739	ouch
YOU1000000044_S0000740	they actually have to truck them from the coast about 200 kilometers to that point then they load them on these train cars and then they load them on the
YOU1000000044_S0000741	yep so they are the maximum they are allowed is 72 cars because well for canada you are allowed a maximum of 2 kilometer rail and then you are allowed to go to the
YOU1000000044_S0000742	because that is the longest spur that they have if it has to go off the tracks
YOU1000000044_S0000743	and they stay publicize it you can go on their website and they show you exactly when the train is leaving the full schedules and
YOU1000000044_S0000744	i have actually never caught a turbine train before i have never caught one
YOU1000000044_S0000745	yeah
YOU1000000044_S0000746	i did not even see a railroad line here in the us norfolk southern has a program
YOU1000000044_S0000747	where they paint some of their locomotives into the railroad paint schemes of railroads that they either merged or just simply no longer exist
YOU1000000044_S0000748	right
YOU1000000044_S0000749	for instance when i was in altoona pennsylvania i actually caught the 1st is what we rail fans here call heritage units
YOU1000000044_S0000750	yes
YOU1000000044_S0000751	and it was the pennsylvania heritage unit
YOU1000000044_S0000752	and i kind of found that a perfect one to catch because the track is going throughout tuna formerly was you owned and ran by the pennsylvania railroad
YOU1000000044_S0000753	wow that is interesting
YOU1000000044_S0000755	yeah you do a lot into the digging behind the scenes that is what i like about what you do actually and
YOU1000000044_S0000756	thank you i will tell you i am into trains i have been into them since i was 2 years old but that is not the only thing that i do on my channel
YOU1000000044_S0000757	i know this live streaming i have only gotten into recently i actually was only started it on my birthday that is really when i 1st got started with this
YOU1000000044_S0000758	and it is sort of been getting more of the attention on my channel ever since
YOU1000000044_S0000760	i really do not know
YOU1000000044_S0000762	it is a great way of getting the view time
YOU1000000044_S0000763	definitely there is nothing wrong with that i mean we are all here to grow and and it is nice to find new ways it is like
YOU1000000044_S0000764	if a painter is started painting and then only did the same type of style the rest of their life and
YOU1000000044_S0000765	that is true
YOU1000000044_S0000766	i actually collaborated with another youtuber recently his name is jesse gillette
YOU1000000044_S0000767	he is a gaming youtuber he does videos on a game called roblox
YOU1000000044_S0000768	yes
YOU1000000044_S0000769	i do not know if you all have heard of it but he and i have done almost 34 videos together now
YOU1000000044_S0000770	wow good
YOU1000000044_S0000771	some of them are what teenagers of my age call memes i will admit they are hilarious some of them are related to me
YOU1000000044_S0000772	some of them i asked him to make 0 my god i tell you i find them funny i do not know if anyone else would but yeah
YOU1000000044_S0000773	i will send you guys a link to his channel right quick let me see if i can pull it up here okay neuro preserver 2000
YOU1000000044_S0000774	see here
YOU1000000044_S0000775	our kids actually are playing roblox
YOU1000000044_S0000777	probably too much
YOU1000000044_S0000779	that is the problem nowadays people my age and younger are just getting more and more addicted to games
YOU1000000044_S0000780	as long as you have other hobbies like you have this and stuff yeah i
YOU1000000044_S0000781	that is true
YOU1000000044_S0000782	it is all about balance
YOU1000000044_S0000784	yes that is true and let me see here i know i have him in a list of channels here let me see here
YOU1000000044_S0000785	also i wanted to ask you you did a trip to alaska did not you
YOU1000000044_S0000786	yes that trip had a lot of firsts if you will that was the 1st time i had been on a jet
YOU1000000044_S0000787	1st time i have been to seattle washington 1st time i had been on a cruise ship 1st time i have been to alaska in general 1st time i went to canada
YOU1000000044_S0000788	1st time i have seen a glacier yeah there was a lot of firsts and i had actually hoped when i was there i would hope to see orca whales
YOU1000000044_S0000789	i would have made a sort of vow to only see whales in the wild and i had never got a chance to see them in alaska i never did
YOU1000000044_S0000790	well that is great because it means you got another reason to go back
YOU1000000044_S0000791	true but it was my grandmother who was able to make the trip possible and i had waited 13 years to go to alaska 13 years
YOU1000000044_S0000792	wow wow 2003 to 2016 and it was mainly due to a film my grandmother brought back on her trip to alaska back in 2003
YOU1000000044_S0000793	it was about a railroad that is in skagway alaska it is called the white pass and yukon route
YOU1000000044_S0000794	okay
YOU1000000044_S0000795	and it has been in use since 1898 and it did not shut down normal revenue service until 1982
YOU1000000044_S0000796	okay and it only stayed closed for 5 years and it reopened into the current operation it does now which is excursion trains in 1988
YOU1000000044_S0000797	and after she brought the documentary back in 2003 i .
YOU1000000044_S0000798	let us just say in her own words once i sat down and watched it i never moved i was enthralled by it
YOU1000000044_S0000799	and she told me the next time she went back she would take me with her and i waited of course like i said 13 years
YOU1000000044_S0000800	and i finally got to see the railroad for myself and ride it in 2016 and i have video footage of it now
YOU1000000044_S0000802	a lot of my film i am still trying to improve on none of the videos are currently edited i will admit that there is a lot of stuff i am still trying to work on with my channel
YOU1000000044_S0000803	
YOU1000000044_S0000805	but i mean i kind of like it that my videos are edited
YOU1000000044_S0000806	because a lot of the time not many youtubers really upload unedited footage anymore and i like to show what normal youtubers really just decide to leave out that is what i like to do
YOU1000000044_S0000807	right well everybody has got to find their own way to express themselves onto it i agree
YOU1000000044_S0000808	probably caps tonight about that that is exactly what it is everybody has got to find their own way that they feel comfortable and spring sending their message and
YOU1000000044_S0000809	that is true
YOU1000000044_S0000810	look at musicians we can like take the same song the same lyrics and give it to 20 different musicians they are all going to come up with a different way of expressing it
YOU1000000044_S0000812	same with the music i mean i have always sometimes i have always said that i feel like i was just born in the wrong time because when you think about it
YOU1000000044_S0000813	if you see my videos especially one i did at kettle creek battlefield near
YOU1000000044_S0000814	it is a revolutionary war battlefield 7 miles from washington georgia where i live i live in athens but the battlefield is 7 miles from washington
YOU1000000044_S0000815	in the video i make a point to mention that i have a deep respect for war veterans a very deep respect for them
YOU1000000044_S0000816	
YOU1000000044_S0000817	because i mean just think about it just what they have gone through alone you know they do not need i do not like it when they are forgotten
YOU1000000044_S0000818	yeah
YOU1000000044_S0000819	and they deserve to be remembered especially for what all they did
YOU1000000044_S0000821	and i have a very deep respect for people who have come before my time
YOU1000000044_S0000822	for a lot of the historical events that have happened before my time all of that
YOU1000000044_S0000823	but what interests me most is a lot of the things that were around before my time a lot of the antiques and whatnot i find that very interesting
YOU1000000044_S0000824	not many people in my generation really care about that stuff
YOU1000000044_S0000825	not many you are right very true very true
YOU1000000044_S0000826	that is true and it is a shame it is so it is great to have somebody like you that might inspire some of them to go and take a 2nd look at it so
YOU1000000044_S0000827	train man would like a shout out of course train man you can have a shout out you can join the panel if you like i would always love to have you and if you do not feel like it tonight some other night

YOU1000000044_S0000870	whenever i do these streams i can never stay and talk about one specific topic
YOU1000000044_S0000871	i mean it just it just it sort of is random when you think about it really
YOU1000000044_S0000872	no that is it that is what keeps the world turning
YOU1000000044_S0000873	see we are on a double we are on our stream and we are on ray rogers stream as well
YOU1000000044_S0000874	nice
YOU1000000044_S0000876	streamception that is what i call that streamception
YOU1000000044_S0000877	that is a good term
YOU1000000044_S0000878	that is right contagious in a good way
YOU1000000044_S0000879	i tell you my parents have actually told me i am pretty much one who is unforgettable and i think they are right
YOU1000000044_S0000880	i recently went to a rail line in west virginia it is called the cass scenic railroad which is really worth checking out by the way
YOU1000000044_S0000881	and i actually befriended one of the guys who works on the train his name is josh and when i met him for the 1st time he was actually a commentator slash brakeman
YOU1000000044_S0000882	and i did not afterwards i ended up leaving cass to go back to georgia once our trip there ended
YOU1000000044_S0000883	i did not go back for 2 years and when i recently made a return trip which is heavily documented on my channel
YOU1000000044_S0000884	now it was also on the same trip where i went to niagara falls okay in ontario canada
YOU1000000044_S0000886	and i saw him and i said hey man you remember me and he was like
YOU1000000044_S0000887	he remembered me after 2 years of not seeing me he remembered who i was
YOU1000000044_S0000888	that is amazing
YOU1000000044_S0000889	that is really cool it is the same with my mom my dad is mother too when she went to i think it was either hong kong or beijing she went there like 3 times
YOU1000000044_S0000890	there was a street vendor who remembered her and he she had not even been back in i think 3 years at one point
YOU1000000044_S0000892	wow yeah well some people are just more memorable sounds like you know them
YOU1000000044_S0000893	i think it depends on their character for it
YOU1000000044_S0000894	you know stand out so that is what you want to do in life that is what you need for youtube so that is all good traits so
YOU1000000044_S0000895	well i mean there is a few reasons i made the channel one the 1st reason originally was i made it
YOU1000000044_S0000897	you know in 2015 but this was when i had just started getting into filming and i at this point i had a computer
YOU1000000044_S0000898	that really did not work too well it always had a hard rocker after 5 or 10 minutes in a sense
YOU1000000044_S0000899	and i lost everything on a really sporadic basis and it was annoying okay it was very annoying
YOU1000000044_S0000900	and the computer i have now which is a toshiba laptop i have had it for almost i think 2 or 3 years now
YOU1000000044_S0000901	it is proven itself to be a very good computer it is only had one hard drive crash and it is not had a crash since knock on wood
YOU1000000044_S0000902	good yes knock on wood for sure
YOU1000000044_S0000903	but yeah when i was uploading my videos or at least trying to save them on my computer i was i mean i had already been into youtube i had been into youtube for a while now
YOU1000000044_S0000904	but yeah hold on a 2nd trainman i included your channel in the description by the way
YOU1000000044_S0000905	but yeah i made the channel so i would have a place to put my videos in case my computer crashed again i would not lose them
YOU1000000044_S0000906	i never really thought anybody would view them or watch them i did not even know if i would get any subscribers
YOU1000000044_S0000907	and keep in mind the footage is still there but it is nearly 4 years old and in my opinion now it is like really bad okay
YOU1000000044_S0000908	i have even labeled one of my playlists which is when i filmed in folkston it is in parentheses
YOU1000000044_S0000909	well bad film if you will because it can not be watched okay i was really inexperienced when i filmed that let me tell you
YOU1000000044_S0000910	well that is we all learn that we all start somewhere and we look back at our own work but i mean that is all part of the process
YOU1000000044_S0000911	and a lot of times it is making a good thing out of something that did not quite work out the way we were hoping
YOU1000000044_S0000912	drew
YOU1000000044_S0000913	i have a video if you ever seen a called montreal slow mo and the reason why is i recorded it by accident out of my car and
YOU1000000044_S0000914	i did not realize i would switched it to 120 frames a 2nd
YOU1000000044_S0000915	0 man
YOU1000000044_S0000916	so i recorded literally 2 hours of slow mo what do i do
YOU1000000044_S0000917	0 no
YOU1000000044_S0000918	i am looking at all this stuff and i am like well it is ruined just
YOU1000000044_S0000919	i am not even in a traffic jam
YOU1000000044_S0000920	and i covered a good 20 kilometers like what 9 mile at 10 miles or something like that i
YOU1000000044_S0000921	wow
YOU1000000044_S0000922	so i decided to kind of pick it up and i took it and turn it into a 1970s cop show and intro which i always used to love those old shows so i
YOU1000000044_S0000923	nice
YOU1000000044_S0000924	might as well do something with it so
YOU1000000044_S0000925	hang on trey mann is asking me something in my stream trey mann i am currently in athens georgia usa
YOU1000000044_S0000926	i have been in georgia since my birth
YOU1000000044_S0000927	actually if you guys i am just curious if you all wanted to know you know why i named my channel railroad preserver 2000
YOU1000000044_S0000928	yes
YOU1000000044_S0000929	well the railroad part refers to my interest
YOU1000000044_S0000930	not just in trains but also in travel and vintage vehicles like planes and cars i have an interest in that
YOU1000000044_S0000931	excellent
YOU1000000044_S0000932	reserver refers to my interests in antiques and
YOU1000000044_S0000934	history
YOU1000000044_S0000935	okay
YOU1000000044_S0000936	of all areas all spectrums and 2000 is really really refers to the year i was born i was born in 2000 so i was born at the start
YOU1000000044_S0000937	kind of figured that when i was not 100% but i was putting my money on that one
YOU1000000044_S0000938	i mean the last it is like 0 you have to be asked you know everyone asks me about the 1st 2 parts of the name but the last part is sort of self explanatory when you think about it
YOU1000000044_S0000939	i think bottle caps was born in 2000 as well you guys got that in common so i
YOU1000000044_S0000940	the bottle catcher is saying it is too old to chase girls now
YOU1000000044_S0000941	yeah i do not believe it for a 2nd
YOU1000000044_S0000942	i do not have a girlfriend to be honest with you as crazy as it sounds i am 17 and i do not have a girlfriend

YOU1000000044_S0000951	0 by the way i sent my friend jesse gillette is channel in the hangouts chat by the way i meant to tell you that earlier
YOU1000000044_S0000952	thank you thank you very much
YOU1000000044_S0000953	yeah i playlist here
YOU1000000044_S0000955	i recently did a stream where it showed me organizing my channel is playlist
YOU1000000044_S0000956	cause i had a lot of same playlist was referred to either music or video video playlist to my interest
YOU1000000044_S0000957	okay
YOU1000000044_S0000958	and i sort of organized them there is music from films i remember watching when i was younger up to the present
YOU1000000044_S0000959	there is documentaries i found on youtube and sort of in a sense of sort of archived here on my channel
YOU1000000044_S0000961	there is gaming videos and comedy i guess you could say from other youtubers some of which are my favorites
YOU1000000044_S0000962	okay
YOU1000000044_S0000963	and
YOU1000000044_S0000964	it is a great idea to put your videos in the playlist it is a great way of showing people what it is about and let them watch it as well
YOU1000000044_S0000965	you can never be in enough lists even including your own
YOU1000000044_S0000966	yes
YOU1000000044_S0000967	drew
YOU1000000044_S0000968	and it is definitely good for the algorithm as well
YOU1000000044_S0000969	yeah
YOU1000000044_S0000971	i mean but that also going back to the reason i made my channel
YOU1000000044_S0000972	aside from me making the channel as a web place to store my videos
YOU1000000044_S0000973	you know i did not as i said you know i did not think anyone would even watch my video
YOU1000000044_S0000974	i did not even you know i had just already you know it sort of it made the assumption you know 0 no one would probably like them anyway but
YOU1000000044_S0000975	eventually you know people started to take notice it was slow at 1st yeah for a few months my channel had gotten to like i think 22 subscribers with
YOU1000000044_S0000976	then it started to drop i was wondering okay you know what was i doing wrong okay
YOU1000000044_S0000977	if you look at my playlist that i filmed in folkestone take note none of the videos are named
YOU1000000044_S0000978	i did not name it i do not think i even named one until like a few weeks back
YOU1000000044_S0000979	and i mean i had footage from cass our drive from charlotte north carolina to cass west virginia
YOU1000000044_S0000980	and keep in mind when i was filming these videos i had an earlier camera it was a i think it was a sony camera
YOU1000000044_S0000981	it was not a camcorder in fact hang on a minute i have the newest camera i use for my trip to alaska right here
YOU1000000044_S0000983	you see here let me get it out here
YOU1000000044_S0000985	this is it this is what i have been using since 2016 and it is proven to be a very good camera
YOU1000000044_S0000986	i got it specifically for the trip to alaska
YOU1000000044_S0000987	okay
YOU1000000044_S0000989	cool that is one of the best cameras i have used
YOU1000000044_S0000990	well that is the biggest thing is if you are comfortable with it that is that is what makes everything and
YOU1000000044_S0000991	i am comfortable with it i can tell you that but the phone i am using to live stream is actually one of the newer electronics i have gotten in a while
YOU1000000044_S0000992	the phone i used to have was one my dad had and it did not live stream
YOU1000000044_S0000993	even when i recorded with a normal camera when you zoomed in on the camera it made everything pixelated 0 my god i hated it i was annoyed by that
YOU1000000044_S0000994	i could not zoom in on any little details i wanted to get
YOU1000000044_S0000996	so i have filmed with that phone where the camera zoomed out most of the time or just barely zoomed in but this one
YOU1000000044_S0000997	like for instance if i do this here let me if you are watching this trend careful for shaky camera footage here let me just do this as an example here okay
YOU1000000044_S0000998	so you see my phone here right you see it is aiming towards the computer seeing you all yeah watch see
YOU1000000044_S0001000	please zoom in here look at that it picks up even the computer screens pixels and then i can see the little details in the buildings in the photo behind you all
YOU1000000044_S0001001	that is amazing what kind of fun is that
YOU1000000044_S0001002	it is a verizon lg g 5 i think is what it is called
YOU1000000044_S0001003	no
YOU1000000044_S0001005	very good phone it is one of the newest phones i have gotten and by god it worked well only problem with my old phone i could record in sort of that 1st person camera view there
YOU1000000044_S0001006	for almost an hour a few minutes
YOU1000000044_S0001007	now with this one i am limited to only 5 minutes so i usually film in multi view
YOU1000000044_S0001008	that is how i got a lot of the video in my bahamas trip filmed it was in a multi view function where you saw my face on one side and then you saw what i wanted the viewers to see on the other
YOU1000000044_S0001009	a lot of the video i filmed in the bahamas was of a steel drummer artist named cordell he was good with playing music on the steel drums
YOU1000000044_S0001010	okay
YOU1000000044_S0001011	and i hit him 0 hello
YOU1000000044_S0001013	you inspired me i never thought to take a picture of what we are doing here
YOU1000000044_S0001015	1st for everything
YOU1000000044_S0001017	you 2 are good to talk to you know that you really are
YOU1000000044_S0001019	we are pretty easy going it is all about having fun doing this
YOU1000000044_S0001020	hey i am having a good time too man
YOU1000000044_S0001021	that is great
YOU1000000044_S0001022	that is the beauty of youtube everyone can come together and just have a good time that is the beauty of it
YOU1000000044_S0001023	that is what it looks like from our side
YOU1000000044_S0001024	okay wow now that is truly professional i like that i like that
YOU1000000044_S0001025	thrown together as it can be
YOU1000000044_S0001026	is this better hey it is better than the setup i have i have just this one laptop and this laptop is the only one i have
YOU1000000044_S0001027	i do not even have an editing software on it okay
YOU1000000044_S0001028	keep that in mind
YOU1000000044_S0001030	i do not mean to switch topics back and forth
YOU1000000044_S0001031	but you know going back to the channel again i mean i am sorry i do not mean to do it
YOU1000000044_S0001032	yeah the other reason has become one of which is sort of another this other reason has become more recent to me
YOU1000000044_S0001033	and that is i have 2 younger sisters one is named peyton the other is named aubrey aubrey is the more recent of the 2
YOU1000000044_S0001034	they came well after me by quite a few years and
YOU1000000044_S0001035	then i realized you know i do not know if my grandmother would still be able to travel by the time those 2 reached my age
YOU1000000044_S0001036	i do not even know and i do not mean any offense to her
YOU1000000044_S0001037	no no
YOU1000000044_S0001038	she is in her late 60s i do not know if she would still
YOU1000000044_S0001039	things can change in a moment you never know
YOU1000000044_S0001040	i do not know if she would still be alive when aubrey is my age
YOU1000000044_S0001041	yeah
YOU1000000044_S0001042	so the reason i wanted to make my channel now is so those 2 can see my videos and see the trips that she and i went on together and
YOU1000000044_S0001043	0 wow
YOU1000000044_S0001044	keep in mind i have been traveling with her like i said when i 1st came on here since 2008
YOU1000000044_S0001045	a lot of those early trips have never been filmed
YOU1000000044_S0001046	in fact i asked her recently you know if we had time or when we had time available if we could try and revisit some of the places we 1st traveled to
YOU1000000044_S0001047	the 1st place i ever went to with her was to kennesaw georgia now that is near atlanta
YOU1000000044_S0001048	and it is where 2 civil war steam locomotives are housed one is named the general the other is named the texas
YOU1000000044_S0001049	okay
YOU1000000044_S0001050	and if you do not know what the andrews rate is i recommend looking it up it is quite unique and it is quite interesting as to how it all played out
YOU1000000044_S0001051	but both locomotives are preserved and i was amazed by the story about it
YOU1000000044_S0001052	
YOU1000000044_S0001053	and it took place during the american civil war
YOU1000000044_S0001054	where some union spies tried to take a confederate locomotive to burn railroad bridges along confederate rail lines
YOU1000000044_S0001055	to try and stop confederate supply movements but unfortunately their plans failed and they were eventually captured by the confederates
YOU1000000044_S0001056	i think all of them received the medal of honor the ones who survived the pow camp
YOU1000000044_S0001058	i think all of them got the medal of honor and i think they were the 1st to receive it except andrews he was excluded as a civilian unfortunately
YOU1000000044_S0001059	but the film has been or the event has been you know sort of i guess you could say immortalized thanks to both locomotives being preserved
YOU1000000044_S0001060	in fact the general was restored to operating condition in the 1960s during the civil war is centennial
YOU1000000044_S0001061	right
YOU1000000044_S0001062	and eventually it found its way into georgia and it has been on display in kennesaw ever since
YOU1000000044_S0001063	texas was on display at the atlanta cyclorama until recently when it went to spencer north carolina for cosmetic restoration from what i heard
YOU1000000044_S0001064	you have amazing retention it is unbelievable you have memory and the way you present yourself is quite it is quite amazing i
YOU1000000044_S0001065	i try

YOU1000000044_S0001070	and i really like what you said about saving it for your sisters that really struck a chord i think that is amazing your intentions for doing all of this and
YOU1000000044_S0001071	and it can happen in a moment is notice
YOU1000000044_S0001072	and i think that is the missing book that you need i should know i mean i have had to go through 2 deaths in my family
YOU1000000044_S0001073	
YOU1000000044_S0001074	0
YOU1000000044_S0001075	1st was my grandmother is mom whom we called donna she from what i heard at 1st
YOU1000000044_S0001076	she had passed away in like a hospital but i found out later her house had caught on fire due to an electrical fault
YOU1000000044_S0001077	0 no
YOU1000000044_S0001078	i mean she was i think she was asleep but and from what i was told you know i think she died from smoke inhalation
YOU1000000044_S0001079	and so the fire did not get her heck her bedroom was untouched and from what i was told she did not even know anything had happened she had passed in her sleep
YOU1000000044_S0001080	which is good she did not suffer which is good but i mean it hit me hard
YOU1000000044_S0001081	because i had never not at once now keep in mind i was only 11 years old when this happened i had never experienced a death in my family before
YOU1000000044_S0001082	and let me tell you it was unexpected i did not even know until
YOU1000000044_S0001084	my mom is dad my mom is mother not my mom is mother blah
YOU1000000044_S0001086	my dad is mother who is the one who i have been telling you all about she is the one who has been taking me on all these trips until he called my mom and told her
YOU1000000044_S0001087	and i mean it still hurts for me to think about it
YOU1000000044_S0001088	and unfortunately it i mean that was not going to be the last time i sort of had a visit from i guess you could say deaf so to speak
YOU1000000044_S0001089	i mean a few years later recently we lost my stepfather is grandmother who we called grandma sandy
YOU1000000044_S0001090	and from what i remember she suffered a heart attack now keep in mind nana i did not get a chance to say goodbye to her
YOU1000000044_S0001091	but not but sandy 0 gosh that was the 1st funeral i ever attended
YOU1000000044_S0001092	and that that was the 1st time i had ever seen a person i once saw alive when they were deceased that has never left me
YOU1000000044_S0001093	it is definitely quite something to go through especially when you are a child it definitely leaves a mark for sure
YOU1000000044_S0001094	i can relate so i understand what you are talking about for sure
YOU1000000044_S0001095	but i am grateful for the memories that we have from the people that have passed
YOU1000000044_S0001096	and i am very happy that you have memories that you are making with your grandma now while traveling
YOU1000000044_S0001097	i am really glad and i mean i would like i like to spend as much time with her as i can and believe me
YOU1000000044_S0001098	i mean i have a deep respect for like i said people who have come before my time she is one of them and she is a very kind lady
YOU1000000044_S0001099	she is very wise humorous heck she is actually hosting a party for some friends right now as i am speaking
YOU1000000044_S0001101	he is the hostess of stratford if you will
YOU1000000044_S0001102	okay
YOU1000000044_S0001103	we are going to we are actually going to be going on another trip in a few days we are going to be revisiting a few towns in georgia down in southwest georgia
YOU1000000044_S0001104	one of them is named cordill georgia i have footage of my 1st trip there on my channel and
YOU1000000044_S0001105	we were going back because of a few things we were not able to do there on my 1st trip
YOU1000000044_S0001106	we were going to ride an excursion train that is down there called the sam short line they have a website you can probably look it up i think
YOU1000000044_S0001107	and they were not running when we were down there before so we are going to try and go down there so i can film that when the train is running
YOU1000000044_S0001108	and we are going to go to a museum in tifton georgia which is a replica of a historic village
YOU1000000044_S0001109	and they have a lot of equipment there that is from i think the 1890s early 20th century
YOU1000000044_S0001110	and it sort of depicts early life in georgia i think from the 1830s to the 1890s and into like i think the early 1900s 1920s i think
YOU1000000044_S0001111	i can not remember exactly how far in time it goes but it is really well done the historians there are really good at telling the story
YOU1000000044_S0001112	and all the buildings i think are original and i think there is only a few that have had to be rebuilt
YOU1000000044_S0001113	but they are rebuilt in such a way to where they do not look like they are modern they are built to where they are original
YOU1000000044_S0001114	which is amazing to me i was impressed at how well they kept all the buildings up and a lot of them actually had steam powered equipment
YOU1000000044_S0001115	now keep in mind my 1st trip there none of it was running
YOU1000000044_S0001116	this time my grandmother has a lot of friends
YOU1000000044_S0001117	and i think a friend of hers daughter who is like i think the curator or something is going to be there
YOU1000000044_S0001118	and they are hosting a festival there so a lot of their equipment is going to be running so that is going to be neat for me to check out and i am going to film it
YOU1000000044_S0001119	and i am hoping this will sort of play out like my return trip to cass where although i did not get a lot filmed on the 1st time i am hoping to get more done on the 2nd time
YOU1000000044_S0001120	okay
YOU1000000044_S0001121	that is amazing as how you are traveling all the time i
YOU1000000044_S0001122	well not exactly all the time i do have school in the way though unfortunately
YOU1000000044_S0001123	there is that but still
YOU1000000044_S0001124	that is the grade level i am in in high school right now
YOU1000000044_S0001125	now do not mind me for just a minute because we are still new to this i just want to try the controls here for a minute okay so
YOU1000000044_S0001126	all right
YOU1000000044_S0001127	so i am just going to try this for a 2nd i am going to 1st hide broadcast from broadcast and bring you back
YOU1000000044_S0001129	there we go okay so we are good sorry guys we got to do this when you are alive it is the only way to try it
YOU1000000044_S0001130	show and broadcast okay you are back
YOU1000000044_S0001132	all right
YOU1000000044_S0001133	okay it is perfect present to everyone this seems to be quite long i
YOU1000000044_S0001134	whoa okay
YOU1000000044_S0001136	well this is interesting
YOU1000000044_S0001138	i may have accidentally muted the stream for a bit
YOU1000000044_S0001139	not my intention okay keep that in mind i did not mean to do that that was a major fail on my part
YOU1000000044_S0001140	do not feel bad we all been there like i say look at us right now we are just
YOU1000000044_S0001141	if you watch you can actually see my reaction and what i was talking to myself about in my stream when i accidentally did it okay
YOU1000000044_S0001142	it was on my face cam though so yeah bit of an issue
YOU1000000044_S0001143	biker bushcraft is saying that he is enjoying your historical perspectives
YOU1000000044_S0001144	yeah
YOU1000000044_S0001145	and he understands your connection to your grandmother and he was born in 1800s and had great stories 0 wow thank you for the comment becker
YOU1000000044_S0001146	i honestly one of the reasons i have a major respect for the people who came before me is because
YOU1000000044_S0001147	i really wish someone could go and interview all these people who were around and were still living in the 1800s
YOU1000000044_S0001148	in the 1900s
YOU1000000044_S0001149	and you know write their stories down because once that person dies their stories are lost for good and and
YOU1000000044_S0001151	my stepfather is grandfather his name was tom butler he was a world war ii veteran
YOU1000000044_S0001152	
YOU1000000044_S0001153	and unfortunately i do not think he was ever interviewed so a lot of his stories are only able to be retold to my stepfather is mouth
YOU1000000044_S0001154	my stepfather actually has 2 japanese rifles that tom butler brought back
YOU1000000044_S0001155	wow yeah try doing that nowadays if you were in their service no offense to any war veterans out there no offense
YOU1000000044_S0001156	no i know what you are saying though i know and they understand this well i am sure
YOU1000000044_S0001157	but i mean they also put in the amazing service and we do thank them very much for their service and anybody who puts their life on the line
YOU1000000044_S0001158	but yeah some of these guys seen some very hard conditions and not much to work with you know it was very primitive and
YOU1000000044_S0001159	i just wanted to show you if you have a 2nd if you would like to see it this is xenia is grandfather he was a general in the russian air force and
YOU1000000044_S0001161	0 wow
YOU1000000044_S0001163	talk about russian style
YOU1000000044_S0001165	sorry that was like a failed russian impression just my bad
YOU1000000044_S0001166	no that is all good that was here and there as well there
YOU1000000044_S0001167	and a very nice thing
YOU1000000044_S0001168	yeah go ahead
YOU1000000044_S0001169	sure
YOU1000000044_S0001170	0 wow and that is a world war i era biplane correct me is that world war i
YOU1000000044_S0001171	world war 2 i will one yeah for that one yes that is her great grandfather here on the left 0
YOU1000000044_S0001172	yep
YOU1000000044_S0001173	0 wow yeah did he ever tell you all any stories you all is parents any stories about him
YOU1000000044_S0001174	yeah my grandfather he was a scientist and inventor
YOU1000000044_S0001175	he mostly liked to talk about his innovations and things like that
YOU1000000044_S0001176	i think he is seen a lot in world war ii that he did not want to talk about because probably it was too traumatic and
YOU1000000044_S0001177	he was i mean it is like some of those guys in vietnam i mean you know i mean that is like that with every soldier i mean you know just what those guys went through alone is enough
YOU1000000044_S0001178	yes definitely
YOU1000000044_S0001179	exactly and my grandmother who also lived through the war and actually in the war time
YOU1000000044_S0001180	she was working in one of the factories putting together guns because that is what they were made to do
YOU1000000044_S0001181	she was telling me more stories about it but you know
YOU1000000044_S0001182	well like when she when she immigrated so to say or was sent to latvia where i am from originally
YOU1000000044_S0001183	the city was still bombed through and she had to every morning go through the ruins of bombed through city to get to work
YOU1000000044_S0001184	so she was telling me more about how it was during and even after the war and about rations and not having food and living on potatoes and all that
YOU1000000044_S0001185	my grandfather i think he is seen the blood of it so to say
YOU1000000044_S0001186	so he was less talkative about the actual war things and more about his inventions
YOU1000000044_S0001187	and the picture you see up now this is exactly
YOU1000000044_S0001188	yep ouch
YOU1000000044_S0001189	yeah he is a quite a man i never got to meet him unfortunately was taken early in life but i
YOU1000000044_S0001190	ouch that is the same with my stepfather is grandfather tom he died in 2004 so i really never got to meet him
YOU1000000044_S0001191	i mean there is one story now that he told my stepfather that my stepfather is told me so he is passed it down which is i am really glad for
YOU1000000044_S0001192	now i do not remember exactly if this now it may not be accurate with me but i think how it went was you know .
YOU1000000044_S0001193	tom was assigned to some of the land clearing teams which cleared out airships so our
YOU1000000044_S0001194	plans could look planes could not planes black there is one of those brain farts you all are talking about i said plans and i meant to say planes
YOU1000000044_S0001196	he was clearing out airstrips on one of the occupied islands so that our planes could land in
YOU1000000044_S0001197	out of nowhere a japanese sniper started shooting at him he was using a bulldozer at the time from what i was told
YOU1000000044_S0001198	so what he did was to protect himself and shield himself was he raised the bucket of the bulldozer up so that the bullets would hit the bucket
YOU1000000044_S0001199	and i guess when he found the tree the sniper was in he used the bulldozer and rammed the tree the sniper was in and knocked the tree down
YOU1000000044_S0001200	wow
YOU1000000044_S0001201	and i think what he did then was he tied the sniper up and i think that was how he got the rifle that my stepfather now has
YOU1000000044_S0001202	i could be wrong on that okay i would have to ask my stepfather for more confirmation in terms of accuracy
YOU1000000044_S0001203	see that is the thing it is kind of like with civil war veterans that is what is happening now to a lot of these world war ii guys
YOU1000000044_S0001204	you know i mean once you know you know because the civil war once the last veteran died in 1959 you know that story has been pretty much forgotten
YOU1000000044_S0001205	they hardly even teach me about it in my school can you believe it
YOU1000000044_S0001206	i learned more about it thanks to a documentary that ken burns made about it than what they are teaching me about it in school
YOU1000000044_S0001207	yeah that is an unfortunate side if i but i believe you on that and
YOU1000000044_S0001208	yes
YOU1000000044_S0001209	by the way getting back to the recording memory so to say or interviews with people that are older
YOU1000000044_S0001210	i recently got into a thing called storycorps i do not know if you have heard about it
YOU1000000044_S0001211	it is basically a website mostly an app where it has either already pre prepared questions
YOU1000000044_S0001212	or you can make your own and make like an interview style going through those questions and record it and save it on a cloud
YOU1000000044_S0001213	and you can either share it or leave it privately but i find it is a great way of preserving things that we were just talking about
YOU1000000044_S0001214	what i am doing i am doing it with my son sometimes
YOU1000000044_S0001215	so that way of preserving more of the way his ideas are changing through the time he is growing up
YOU1000000044_S0001216	but lots of people are actually using it to talk with older generations so it is not something to look into so called story corpse
YOU1000000044_S0001217	all right i will look into it also you are going to find me crazy but what if i told you i have actually met in my lifetime 3 world war ii veterans though i have actually met 3 of them
YOU1000000044_S0001218	okay
YOU1000000044_S0001219	yeah
YOU1000000044_S0001220	i met the 1st one on the plane flight back from seattle it was after a plane touchdown in atlanta
YOU1000000044_S0001221	and as we were getting off i just happened to glance over and saw his hat and it showed he was a world war ii veteran i mean i did not say anything to him i just saluted him
YOU1000000044_S0001222	and he actually turned to me and he smiled and i mean that i was glad i mean because i mean i already knew those guys were starting to be forgotten
YOU1000000044_S0001223	because you know i think it said over 1000 are dying each day
YOU1000000044_S0001224	
YOU1000000044_S0001225	which is unfortunate but after that i think the 2nd one i met was i met him he was at a home depot
YOU1000000044_S0001226	think it was either in commerce or eastside in georgia i can not remember exactly where but
YOU1000000044_S0001227	i ended up talking to him and he actually showed me a picture of the plane he was assigned to
YOU1000000044_S0001228	i think it was either a b 17 bomber or b 25 i can not remember exactly
YOU1000000044_S0001229	but he and i were talking and i saluted him i mean anytime i see a war veteran i salute them
YOU1000000044_S0001231	and i mean i was deeply impressed by what he had gone through
YOU1000000044_S0001233	that was sort of an honor for me i had never gotten a chance to talk to another war veteran
YOU1000000044_S0001234	and the 3rd one i have met was one who was able to attend our veterans day assembly at my school
YOU1000000044_S0001235	and i spoke to him and a few other war veterans from other wars and i mean he was the oldest one there
YOU1000000044_S0001237	but yeah i mean that is sort of never left me either and i mean i feel it kind of an honor that i was able to meet those guys because i mean they saw what true war was
YOU1000000044_S0001239	and unfortunately i mean i know a lot of other veterans on other sides have seen far worse unfortunately which is you know like i say you know
YOU1000000044_S0001241	that is what i mean you know and just what those guys went through you know was enough that is what i mean
YOU1000000044_S0001242	
YOU1000000044_S0001243	i mean i have actually never met a world war ii soldier who is actually been to like say normandy or .
YOU1000000044_S0001244	you know the ones who the guys some of the guys who actually you know fought back through france but
YOU1000000044_S0001246	i mean i do not know if they would i do not know if they had been interviewed before or not but still i mean like i said that that has stuck with me
YOU1000000044_S0001247	yeah definitely a lot there of history for sure well thank you very much for all your stories it is amazing yeah you guys

YOU1000000044_S0001252	i mean and it is up to us to decide which path to take in life
YOU1000000044_S0001253	you can either take the good path make the right choices and make the right decision you will end up living a happy long life
YOU1000000044_S0001254	i mean unfortunately for some they just people they just chose to take the bad take the bad path and they make the bad choices and unfortunately they they
YOU1000000044_S0001255	do not live very long lives and it is usually ones that they end up either regretting in the end or just are not happy with
YOU1000000044_S0001256	that is very true sir
YOU1000000044_S0001257	i mean the choice can not be forced i mean it is our choice and choice it is our choice alone

YOU1000000044_S0001305	i think that is going to be the most often question we have to change the pictures every time
YOU1000000044_S0001306	yeah yeah exactly we will have a rotate because i know something like volocons going to say 0 they are talking about it again i can hear him right now
YOU1000000044_S0001308	this is from our trip my backpacking trip i did and that is the different countries that i visited when i spent 2 weeks by train in europe
YOU1000000044_S0001309	but that one that you are asking about particularly that is ljubljana slovenia
YOU1000000044_S0001310	and we each have a big picture behind one of the coaches here we each picked one of our favorites and xenia pictors was from iceland
YOU1000000044_S0001311	and this was mine because it was just fun it was one of the most beautiful places surprisingly beautiful i did not think it was it could be that beautiful there so i
YOU1000000044_S0001312	that is why i picked that one to be the rest are all black and white from the other countries but we did one color one each
YOU1000000044_S0001313	we talked a little bit in the beginning of the stream about traveling and places in europe
YOU1000000044_S0001314	so if you have anything to add to that please welcome and drop a comment
YOU1000000044_S0001315	that is amazing so beautiful hazel says yes
YOU1000000044_S0001316	thank you it is my go to picture
YOU1000000044_S0001317	as i stated i never buy a souvenir the only souvenirs i actually buy is i buy one fridge bag that in every country and
YOU1000000044_S0001318	and that actually goes in my mom is fridge because that was started as kind of a tradition
YOU1000000044_S0001319	the pictures memories are my souvenirs so i hold them very closely and i am not into souvenirs
YOU1000000044_S0001320	every picture i look at around the room kind of tells a story or a moment in time from different travels
YOU1000000044_S0001321	some of the xenia that we had some great adventures
YOU1000000044_S0001322	our 1st trip we ever did together was estonia we went to tallins which was absolutely incredible
YOU1000000044_S0001323	and then we took the ferry it was about what it is an hour and a half right i think yeah to helsinki finland
YOU1000000044_S0001324	it was unbelievable it was so amazing our 1st time i
YOU1000000044_S0001325	hell sink a finland was actually one of my bucket list places i always picked the cold ones which is weird coming from canada but
YOU1000000044_S0001326	is it warm this evening in california hazel yeah i was cute so my parting tip always shoot a 2nd take
YOU1000000044_S0001327	my 2nd take saved me from a reshoot last night definitely sure glad i had the footage 0 you got that right
YOU1000000044_S0001328	the video i just did recently a biker bushcrow i do not know if you seen it she brought back the 80s to montreal and
YOU1000000044_S0001329	there is some panning shots of the city my poor son i think he was going to pull his hair at one point because we are literally down there for 2 hours and
YOU1000000044_S0001330	and we ended up with over 50 some shots of each section just because it is that time of evening when it is hard to guess what the lighting is going to be like
YOU1000000044_S0001331	what it will look like once you put it through the editing box and like you say they do get lost so yes definitely always back up everything
YOU1000000044_S0001332	now maybe you will go and shoot it even better but most times yeah you will never recreate that moment so definitely double up and then you will never get that moment
YOU1000000044_S0001333	drip all up if you can
YOU1000000044_S0001334	that is the beauty of the digital technologies now that we can do that
YOU1000000044_S0001335	you know when we were using 8 millimeters
YOU1000000044_S0001336	yeah
YOU1000000044_S0001337	or filming the camera for photos unfortunately you were not able to do that fortunately or fortunately some might say
YOU1000000044_S0001338	but now you can do as many takes or as many pictures as possible and if you can do it and then you can choose the best one
YOU1000000044_S0001339	just somebody went to a wedding and they are sitting there with a roll of their film and you know the 35 millimeter we all remember what that was like you know and
YOU1000000044_S0001340	you are waiting and waiting and waiting for that perfect shot because you only had 3 shots left on your camera and
YOU1000000044_S0001342	yeah i like that biker bushcraft lol everyone is perfect until you are in post how true is that and
YOU1000000044_S0001343	this is this is a killer shot till you get home and it looks absolutely horrible or you lost it that it that is the truth and
YOU1000000044_S0001344	as many professionals say i think too you have to do the most preparation before the shot as possible
YOU1000000044_S0001345	the most you can do before is better if there is something you can do in post great
YOU1000000044_S0001346	but the more you do with the light with composition with the way you are moving your camera like everything which you can do before it and make sure before you actually shoot if it is possible
YOU1000000044_S0001347	preparation is key lots of preparation you know and and it is scouting the place out if i had a new place that i wanted to shoot i will definitely walk all around it i
YOU1000000044_S0001348	look for things that are going to look horrible later on in film i have seen myself picking up garbage by a train yard one time literally i picked up probably 25 pieces and
YOU1000000044_S0001349	because it was an amazing place to shoot but of course litter was blowing off the highway and yes you might notice it so much when you are looking through the camera and
YOU1000000044_S0001350	but when you get into posts like biker says then it really sticks out
YOU1000000044_S0001351	and that is an awful thing when you put all the 23 hours work into something just to bring it back and it is all non usable
YOU1000000044_S0001353	definitely and i think it is the details that makes the difference as you said picking up the garbage
YOU1000000044_S0001354	you know it is noticing these details that might be distracting in your video or your photo and getting rid of them
YOU1000000044_S0001355	or making it just a little bit different you know those details is what makes the difference
YOU1000000044_S0001356	
YOU1000000044_S0001357	when you watch the video or a photo
YOU1000000044_S0001358	but i when i take photos i kind of do the same as i do with video i kind of do the same with
YOU1000000044_S0001359	the windmill train that was brought up a while ago that is a great example there is a shot in the town where i grew up cascade you where it is looking the train is crossing the trussell bridge and
YOU1000000044_S0001360	there was lots of open places to shoot it but it was so much more interesting i went down with a bank and you have poplar trees that were kind of intertwined a bit and
YOU1000000044_S0001361	i have been back a couple of them i try not to break them if i did not have to so when i shot i would have some trees in front of it you know some nice little branches
YOU1000000044_S0001362	and that is so many people try to go for this like crystal clear unobstructed view
YOU1000000044_S0001363	but when you shoot like that you have just a couple of branches here and there it gives you that peeping feel that people love like they are they have found something special and
YOU1000000044_S0001364	and it really really brings out your shot it makes the subject so much more interesting
YOU1000000044_S0001365	you are going to remember that the shot that is taken in a from standing and eye level is the most common shot you are going to ever see anywhere
YOU1000000044_S0001366	yes
YOU1000000044_S0001367	so before you are taking a video or a photo think about that
YOU1000000044_S0001368	if you are standing and you are doing this probably 1000 2000 3000 people already did that especially if it is somewhere in the tourist place
YOU1000000044_S0001369	so once you do this remember that and try to go either lower or or in a different angle that is just a point yes just so it is different and
YOU1000000044_S0001370	because after even with the best post edit there is going to be 1000s of pictures of a straight up lake louise straight up grand canyon
YOU1000000044_S0001371	and all the other places it could ever imagine
YOU1000000044_S0001372	definitely
YOU1000000044_S0001373	so yes when you sing this move
YOU1000000044_S0001374	yes shit under your leg
YOU1000000044_S0001375	corner will give it more perspective because the angle was shot from versus a straight on one that is crystal clear and
YOU1000000044_S0001376	video i almost always shoot as well as my camera as well but i am almost always shooting at chest level and
YOU1000000044_S0001377	that is the kind of give of in between view of child and adult most animals would see from that perspective and
YOU1000000044_S0001378	most people that are watching your work now is that always the case time will tell but for now i am going to go ahead and
YOU1000000044_S0001379	for me i just found that is kind of what is worked the best for myself
YOU1000000044_S0001381	another tip for taking pictures by the way you have undermined it because you were saying about the chest level
YOU1000000044_S0001382	if you want to have a nice and clear picture try to hold the camera not in a straight out hand but as close as possible to your body
YOU1000000044_S0001383	basically your body is a tripod
YOU1000000044_S0001384	yeah definitely for sure
YOU1000000044_S0001385	lots of people do this because now we can see the back of the screen with the view so we want to see what is there right
YOU1000000044_S0001386	do not do that that is where your hands start to get shaky and
YOU1000000044_S0001387	you got no control
YOU1000000044_S0001388	on no control at all the closer you are to your body with it the better the picture or the video is because it works like a tripod
YOU1000000044_S0001389	yes us fanboy talk once again we will bring up peter mckenna he gave a great example for how he was doing the dropping shots and
YOU1000000044_S0001390	was to put the camera strap around your neck hold your camera out so that way you do have some support already you know you do not want it too far away
YOU1000000044_S0001391	adjust your straps it is about here which is usually for most people when they pick up their camera you can shoot and just on one foot just let yourself pivot ahead and
YOU1000000044_S0001392	and you only have about 23 seconds but you could actually catch a lot in that 23 seconds
YOU1000000044_S0001393	and you get a nice panning shot so if you want a flower or maybe a small brook somewhere and you want to get that nice panning shot it is doing that
YOU1000000044_S0001394	just let yourself standing on one foot and let yourself just lightly go ahead on your own momentum and you can really get some great shots
YOU1000000044_S0001395	and do that from different angles hold the camera up with you with the sling or the strap and just turn it slowly and
YOU1000000044_S0001396	you are not going to be able to keep it forever but you will you know you always know you keep that little bit of steady momentum as you do it and that really helps a lot and
YOU1000000044_S0001398	hazel is asking if we are carrying around charged batteries
YOU1000000044_S0001399	definitely all kinds of charge batteries
YOU1000000044_S0001400	let me count okay so one is always in the camera charge
YOU1000000044_S0001401	every time i come back from somewhere where i got the shoot i come back and i charge right away the batteries
YOU1000000044_S0001402	that is just a given so there is always one charge inside and i think i have 4 or 5 extra
YOU1000000044_S0001403	never a shortage of them that is for sure
YOU1000000044_S0001404	why because we sometimes shoot weddings and believe me i go through all of them and sometimes even need to charge extra
YOU1000000044_S0001405	and that is lithium batteries of a sony camera that i am using
YOU1000000044_S0001406	so that is a lot of batteries to go through in an 8 hour sometimes
YOU1000000044_S0001407	and why by the way because oftentimes as a wedding photographer or event photographer who go to baptism
YOU1000000044_S0001408	which by the way we will have a shoot on this sunday next sunday
YOU1000000044_S0001409	i do not want to lose a shot so i oftentimes just keep the shutter open and just wait for the right moment
YOU1000000044_S0001410	i do not want to lose the emotion or the face expression so i just keep it open obviously batteries draining as i am doing that and
YOU1000000044_S0001411	that is why i sometimes go through 56 of them during the event
YOU1000000044_S0001412	but yes we definitely always always extra charging batteries even with the phone charger is always with me and we charge it in the car
YOU1000000044_S0001413	because i do not you know not for being able to talk to it but to take pictures even with the phone when i do not have my camera with me what about you
YOU1000000044_S0001414	me i keep i have 4 batteries and mine is a bit tricky for the simple reason the controller is my cell phone that is how that one is controlled and
YOU1000000044_S0001415	so i have to keep extra batteries for a cell phone plus extra batteries for the camera itself and
YOU1000000044_S0001416	the 4 lithium batteries for the camera as soon as one runs out i am literally plugging it in and charging it and
YOU1000000044_S0001417	i will try all day i will plan it out so when we do a wedding i will look around and see the different areas we are going to be filming where the plugins are available and i always try and reserve them in advance so
YOU1000000044_S0001418	i will ask the dj or i will ask the concierge whoever has any control over them to at least save me one and
YOU1000000044_S0001419	and from there i am just plugging in and recharging i never take a chance i should get more batteries really
YOU1000000044_S0001420	4 seems to work okay because i have always been lucky to plug them in but at some point my luck is going to run out
YOU1000000044_S0001421	and it does you never know when magic moves we had a wedding one time well the one with jeffrey and them and
YOU1000000044_S0001422	yeah
YOU1000000044_S0001423	and i thought they were pretty much done with us and then all of a sudden they decided these mother in law was giving them this gift and they were on film and
YOU1000000044_S0001424	and just by the grace of god i had enough battery left in the last battery to get the shot
YOU1000000044_S0001425	maybe not as many as i would have liked to but at least we got it covered
YOU1000000044_S0001426	things creep on you really quickly and you have got to be prepared for everything and batteries is the key
YOU1000000044_S0001427	batteries and sd cards
YOU1000000044_S0001428	because sd cards can crap out at you at any time you can shoot a lot more footage than you were ever expecting to shoot and
YOU1000000044_S0001429	so that is 2 things we always keep a lot of i actually keep mine in a glasses case not for these glasses the ones i had before
YOU1000000044_S0001430	that we usually never use well that one and that is where i keep all my sd cards and i keep all my little bits that i need for that kind of stuff and i am not sure if you guys
YOU1000000044_S0001431	bulk has asking
YOU1000000044_S0001432	okay you okay you have you have watched a variety of my videos now i want you to tell me what i am doing wrong and
YOU1000000044_S0001433	and that is the thing i think we are all asking each other i know it is not it sounds like kind of a generic answer and
YOU1000000044_S0001434	i do not think you are doing anything wrong like i say we are not aces either we are still learning and i mean we have gotten some really great compliments and i appreciate it
YOU1000000044_S0001436	lot of it has been the marketing our site that really is just getting people to watch it that has been the biggest part of all for growing and
YOU1000000044_S0001437	you got you got interesting content i do not see why people would not be interested into it it depends what you want to edit like i mean you
YOU1000000044_S0001438	if you are going to go more into what would i do it does it is more of a learning curve than others people that are light years ahead of me
YOU1000000044_S0001439	but it is a lot more work and so it takes a you know and you need to make sure you have a decent computer for it
YOU1000000044_S0001440	it is a lot a lot and the same with exam with photography a lot of youtube tutorial tutorials so
YOU1000000044_S0001441	i am constantly on it trying either to learn what i need i will think okay well i want this to flash and turn and do whatever i
YOU1000000044_S0001442	i am on youtube and looking for somebody who is done it already or something at least close enough and
YOU1000000044_S0001443	also watching my spare time to always look to see what somebody else is doing and
YOU1000000044_S0001444	and it is an art all in itself editing you know and there is people who edit who are horrible at taking video and
YOU1000000044_S0001445	and that is what is tricky about what we all do here and we have got to remember that we have people here who love working with wood
YOU1000000044_S0001446	but now all of a sudden they also have to learn how to be video photographers they have to learn how to be editors they got to learn how to read analytics in youtube
YOU1000000044_S0001447	we wear so many hats now
YOU1000000044_S0001448	we all wish kind of sometimes we had somebody like myself taking video with my camera i do enjoy it now more
YOU1000000044_S0001449	it is more suited to the way i like to take i like to do my videography
YOU1000000044_S0001450	but i would be more than happy if somebody was shooting the stuff here like we could hire somebody doing that and i was sitting here just editing because that is where i feel the most creative and
YOU1000000044_S0001451	now some people the exact opposite they will shoot for days they have such an amazing eye and they would rather cut off their own arm than have to do any video editing and
YOU1000000044_S0001452	marketing on youtube it is a whole package you see what i am typing it
YOU1000000044_S0001453	hazel we are not experts
YOU1000000044_S0001454	you were too kind
YOU1000000044_S0001456	yeah we are just trying to help each other the same as we learn from other people what we are doing you know if anybody have questions does not mean that we have perfect answers i would not call us expert no
YOU1000000044_S0001457	and if you have something that you can do that we have forgotten or know more about please i am all ears we would love to the whole point is for us to learn as well i
YOU1000000044_S0001459	i asked him a question but they never got back to me what was your question is there some kind of lag in the chat system
YOU1000000044_S0001460	i would say so usually there is at any given time and
YOU1000000044_S0001462	yeah i think we answered all the questions by the way i wanted to address your channel in general and please do not start
YOU1000000044_S0001464	i wanted to tell you just one thing and i know you do not want to hear about marketing you know how i remembered your channel
YOU1000000044_S0001465	i remembered your channel on out of all of the 1000s that we watched it is hard sometimes to remember which is which and you have got to go back again and again and
YOU1000000044_S0001466	but what really struck a chord is a thumbnail of your video of gilly is bay
YOU1000000044_S0001467	with a bird i thought the shot itself as a photographer 1st of all i thought it was amazing
YOU1000000044_S0001468	i remember andrew was showing me your channel and i am like 0 my god look at that i could not believe the shot
YOU1000000044_S0001469	but what i am saying when i am looking at all your videos all together it jumps out that thumbnail is just like 0 my god i want to see what is there
YOU1000000044_S0001470	yep
YOU1000000044_S0001471	and i think you should have that as an example to the rest of your videos have your sundays like that
YOU1000000044_S0001472	you have your channel is name on them which is great
YOU1000000044_S0001473	but these capturing thumbnails like you have in these ghillie is bay video thumbnail do them like that on the rest of your videos
YOU1000000044_S0001474	it is amazing i am telling you as a professional photographer i could not believe my eyes i needed to see it up close and that is how i remembered it
YOU1000000044_S0001475	and that is why i was coming back and watching other videos because of that thumbnail
YOU1000000044_S0001476	yeah thumbnails are so important and we all kind of make that mistake at the beginning and i have been there many times i
YOU1000000044_S0001477	the thumbnails that you see for our videos i have redone them i think it is 4 times now yeah to get them where i want to get them
YOU1000000044_S0001478	and some things i have learned like one of my favorite ones is one of the latest ones we did was the train in the fog in kingston ontario
YOU1000000044_S0001479	before i would have taken a screenshot it would have been further back and
YOU1000000044_S0001480	yes you could see the train yes you could probably guess there was a bit of fog in there and
YOU1000000044_S0001481	but now if you look at it
YOU1000000044_S0001482	i had i take the shot bring it into photoshop the 1st thing i do is i up the contrast a lot and i am going to go to the image and i am going to
YOU1000000044_S0001483	because it is smaller i really want it to punch then i bring up the blocks so the shadows i still want you to see detail but
YOU1000000044_S0001484	but i am going to get it to the exact point the sweetest spot where it is as jet black as can be where you can still make out what is in there
YOU1000000044_S0001485	and then i the fog was actually 0 my god i feel like it is going to be a drinking game soon if i bring up peter mckinnon one more time
YOU1000000044_S0001486	but talk about getting ideas we were watching and he was showing about how to do a motion blur to give your picture more depth
YOU1000000044_S0001487	i have done that before but i had not done it in so long and i seen it and 2 days later i was working the thumbnail from that i thought that is it that is what i am missing and
YOU1000000044_S0001488	so i took the shot then layered on top of each other and then i added the motion blur to it and
YOU1000000044_S0001489	then started as a layer mask cleaning it out and gave it that mask where the train comes punching through the fog and
YOU1000000044_S0001490	because people are not going to see the big picture that you are working on to at the time
YOU1000000044_S0001491	like you see on the screen they are literally seeing this at the best of times
YOU1000000044_S0001492	very very high contrast pictures is what works great for a lot of people
YOU1000000044_S0001493	like you nailed it there really nailed it and use that as your example and go back and do your thumbnails and then you can do your thumbnails and then you can do your thumbnails
YOU1000000044_S0001494	i know it is your bottle cap logo i like it it is very punchy and
YOU1000000044_S0001495	would almost still consider maybe finding the spot that you like to use it and use it the same place in all your photos and
YOU1000000044_S0001496	like if you notice ours has pushes stories with the white band across the bottom and usually the 4 k on top
YOU1000000044_S0001497	except for a few of them where i did the photo series or the the hour long trains i could not make it into 4 k it was too long and
YOU1000000044_S0001498	all it is is one photoshop document i back it up of course and
YOU1000000044_S0001499	but with every layer is all of them for those thumbnails
YOU1000000044_S0001500	and i always just go in and add a new layer or a new folder in that and work on that
YOU1000000044_S0001501	so everything always stays in the same uniform scale every time
YOU1000000044_S0001502	the banner is always in the same place and the only thing that changes the layers behind it and the only thing that changes is the layers behind it
YOU1000000044_S0001503	maybe you can share screens on one of his videos if you really want to hear
YOU1000000044_S0001504	yeah
YOU1000000044_S0001505	1st one can you go over well we are going to ask him 1st 0 okay minds bottle caps would you mind if we opened up one of your videos to look at

YOU1000000044_S0001533	no and we are not bashing me i mean we do not have all the answers i mean i am sure people look at our 2nd god what are they doing you know you can not please everybody and
YOU1000000044_S0001534	you look like jack nicholson are you talking about my husband amazing resemblance
YOU1000000044_S0001535	let me look
YOU1000000044_S0001536	i do not know maybe so i am going to be looking through a different set of eyes now
YOU1000000044_S0001538	yeah yeah yeah yeah according to the question is from which movie
YOU1000000044_S0001540	according to bottle cast would definitely be picking something like that okay so let us see here i am just going to bear with you i want to get this set up
YOU1000000044_S0001542	this will be another 1st
YOU1000000044_S0001544	okay application screen share
YOU1000000044_S0001545	okay now we are going to try this sound i hope this works okay so
YOU1000000044_S0001547	great shot
YOU1000000044_S0001549	great opening shot
YOU1000000044_S0001551	that opening shot is absolutely i do not see any problem with it i
YOU1000000044_S0001552	i love the movement i love the pause in the beginning the composition of the shot the setup is great and
YOU1000000044_S0001553	i would work a little bit on the histogram
YOU1000000044_S0001554	yes that is why i said shot specifically meaning that the direction you were going into i knew exactly would talk about color and
YOU1000000044_S0001555	as you notice right here in this spot you can see that there is
YOU1000000044_S0001557	so you can see the only thing right now is you are missing is some definition between your clouds your water and your grass and
YOU1000000044_S0001558	it is a nice shot and really it is not a ton of he does not need to rebuild it or anything it is just it is just bringing up your blocks a bit more and
YOU1000000044_S0001559	you know it is around the grass here that the the the the water side grass it would make them more defined that way and
YOU1000000044_S0001560	and even though it is a nice blue sky in that i would bring back maybe even a bit of a yellow tint just a tiny bit and i would add a little bit of a yellow tint
YOU1000000044_S0001561	just to kind of bring a little little little bit of life into the plants that are there or try your greens a bit
YOU1000000044_S0001562	but usually yellow gives you a more cinematic look but you do not add much of it and that is a big key this is a side note
YOU1000000044_S0001563	that happens a lot where people get crazy with the slider they start moving it left right as far as they can go
YOU1000000044_S0001564	almost everything you do should be within maybe what 10% yeah i would say is a good number to keep in mind and
YOU1000000044_S0001565	because you will distort it so badly in the end it will not even look recognizable anymore and
YOU1000000044_S0001566	yeah i yeah my suggestion would be bringing the highlights a little bit down and bringing the shadows a little bit up and
YOU1000000044_S0001567	the trick in getting the detail but not getting your shot too too dark is getting your shadows a little bit up
YOU1000000044_S0001568	it is not going to be enough to blow it out completely
YOU1000000044_S0001569	but it is going to give that nice detail in the darkest parts as for example in your trees here
YOU1000000044_S0001570	that would be more visible right
YOU1000000044_S0001571	and also here maybe the highlights are good i would even say they are great
YOU1000000044_S0001572	but right here if you would just put the highlights a little bit down
YOU1000000044_S0001573	i would be able to see more of the water more of the clouds more of that beautiful beautiful scenery in the background there
YOU1000000044_S0001574	so yeah so that is what i would say with regards to that we can play it along again where are we okay
YOU1000000044_S0001576	yeah beautiful movement the composition of the shot is amazing
YOU1000000044_S0001578	and you see right away here you are doing what a lot of people are doing online
YOU1000000044_S0001579	not to degrade your work saying that you do not need to feel like you have made some sort of abomination
YOU1000000044_S0001580	look at the past one with the birds like a little bit of contrast those birds will pop right under the water and
YOU1000000044_S0001582	beautiful beautiful you have a great shot here
YOU1000000044_S0001583	nice speed not too fast not too slow amazing
YOU1000000044_S0001584	here is 0 right here here is what i would avoid and this is common with most drone shots everything was flowing i am going to put this back and
YOU1000000044_S0001585	let me see even a bit further because i want to catch this where it happens now you see the flow you had since you left land
YOU1000000044_S0001586	and you went out there beautiful right here where you are starting to turn that is where i would fade out
YOU1000000044_S0001587	i would never keep that turn in there and as you turn here once you straighten out and you find your angle that you are going in i
YOU1000000044_S0001589	that is where i would be bringing the video back in like here like let us go by see how you are kind of panning up here slowly and
YOU1000000044_S0001590	you could use that as a shot cutting out all the middle between where i had stopped and here
YOU1000000044_S0001591	like this is nice it is getting .
YOU1000000044_S0001593	the problem with drones and this has been a big big argument for a while is
YOU1000000044_S0001595	if you are making a video and you just want to show flying a drone in an area leave it it is good
YOU1000000044_S0001596	if you want to make it more cinematic think of all the movies you have ever seen where there has been a lifted camera and
YOU1000000044_S0001597	never show all the turnings because i mean a drone is not a perfect turn when it does one it is very very disjointed
YOU1000000044_S0001598	it is turning it is rising it does not quite know where to go it is steadying out
YOU1000000044_S0001599	cut out the fat remember when i said even with my camera i never shoot a building if i want it straight on i always start away from it and pan across it and
YOU1000000044_S0001600	because i will actually cut out that beginning part where i started and it is a little bit jittery and wait till the movement is fluid and that is where i will start my video and
YOU1000000044_S0001601	where it starts to get kind of going the same way at the end that is where i will cut it off and
YOU1000000044_S0001602	that makes tons and tons and tons of difference in your footage
YOU1000000044_S0001603	because you have got great footage right here and this turn you can use that and then maybe cut it again afterwards
YOU1000000044_S0001605	see like this is beautiful panning shots like this you can use
YOU1000000044_S0001607	but you got to separate them when it looks like it is moving off and the drone is steadying itself cut it out
YOU1000000044_S0001608	and maybe you will have to skip 5 seconds but at least you will have good footage and then you can show here
YOU1000000044_S0001609	so sometimes with that i would do is the 1st turn and then say there was a bit of a jitteriness and then another nice turn but almost the same level and
YOU1000000044_S0001610	i would actually take that next i would cut out the bad part and the next one i would zoom in maybe i
YOU1000000044_S0001612	or zoom out as well 20% so it does not look like the same cut because then it looks like a jump shot where it is the same view
YOU1000000044_S0001613	so bring it in a bit more or bring it out a bit more
YOU1000000044_S0001615	yeah you definitely detail a color look at all that color in the water like i just want to punch in it you know
YOU1000000044_S0001616	yeah yeah
YOU1000000044_S0001617	the blue and green would bring so much life in it right away
YOU1000000044_S0001618	also all the details in the woods there they are just screaming to get out
YOU1000000044_S0001619	yeah
YOU1000000044_S0001621	you would be able to see so much also underneath the water the the the bed waterbed
YOU1000000044_S0001622	and if you would go down in the highlights right here in this shot it would be able to see much more of the things under the water
YOU1000000044_S0001624	that is where i would have cut that part out and then maybe start here if you have enough distance and the stays smooth and then maybe you can cut that out
YOU1000000044_S0001625	cut cut out all your jittery parts and then you have them on the timeline and from there you have all your good cuts figure out how you work them into the music
YOU1000000044_S0001627	music is key you want everything to follow the beat you can zoom in and see every note how it goes up and down and you will see a pattern into it
YOU1000000044_S0001628	and from there you can really sync it up with the music and that is the biggest key to building something really great really quick and
YOU1000000044_S0001629	i am just going to put this i am going to try something here control this is not the best way to do it but we are going to try it control i
YOU1000000044_S0001630	prince rand
YOU1000000044_S0001631	i do not know if this will even work but you know what we are going to try something here tonight we are going to try something new
YOU1000000044_S0001632	you can still see the chart right honorable
YOU1000000044_S0001633	yep
YOU1000000044_S0001634	okay
YOU1000000044_S0001636	this is not the high res version of what you did i just took a screen a screen capture and
YOU1000000044_S0001638	but we are going to try this so bear with us
YOU1000000044_S0001640	there is your shot
YOU1000000044_S0001642	now control l let us even just try and we are doing this in photoshop because it is a picture obviously but i am just going to try all the levels just for the fun of it
YOU1000000044_S0001644	so we are just going to bring up the color i am just going to bring up the saturation a little bit
YOU1000000044_S0001645	you guys see that
YOU1000000044_S0001647	i can not see it here
YOU1000000044_S0001648	you can not see it
YOU1000000044_S0001649	no
YOU1000000044_S0001651	can you see anything on your stream
YOU1000000044_S0001653	i tried photoshop today that was working let us just go back 0 okay so it is not working
YOU1000000044_S0001654	think it is just because of the bandwidth we tried it today quickly i tried today quickly and it was working i want to try once more let us just
YOU1000000044_S0001656	hard to do and i have been reading that a lot of people are trying to get into the
YOU1000000044_S0001657	that is why i want to go to the other program soon just having a chance to set it up yet i may be there and
YOU1000000044_S0001659	let us see if that is where it is showing up on here
YOU1000000044_S0001661	still not up there yep yep okay
YOU1000000044_S0001663	yeah so honey do you want to do more the color person you want to do
YOU1000000044_S0001664	i am doing it it does not really need a lot of it is not making sense i am just trying to make it easy
YOU1000000044_S0001665	i am just going to bring up the bottom levels a little bit yeah i think that is a good one
YOU1000000044_S0001666	look already the block is coming out to the back and then we will just play with the mids a little bit we will just pull them back
YOU1000000044_S0001668	maybe i will do a separate live where i can go through with a tutorial of how to get your picture punchier
YOU1000000044_S0001669	yeah
YOU1000000044_S0001671	we can do a short one ready one day
YOU1000000044_S0001672	you see if you bring all in the situations black but if you have just raised the saturation a little bit you know your colors are already coming back and you can and the lightness and
YOU1000000044_S0001673	you are already getting more mood now remember like i say this is a low res version because i just took a screenshot so it is quite hard to work with
YOU1000000044_S0001675	it really it is it is just playing with it you know the
YOU1000000044_S0001677	but already your trees are coming out more i should have made a copy of it but let us see here i
YOU1000000044_S0001679	there is the beginning
YOU1000000044_S0001681	you can see already the buildings coming out more and stuff like that and like i said this is just a very very fast edit on the fly and
YOU1000000044_S0001682	right and like i said the composition on the flow of the video is amazing but
YOU1000000044_S0001683	if you toggle between before and after you can see how much punchier the
YOU1000000044_S0001685	it just grabs the eye more so bottle caps you were talking the other day about viewer attention and that you need more hours and that people subscribe and leave
YOU1000000044_S0001686	but these are the things that keep them staying
YOU1000000044_S0001687	this is what keeps them watching your video to the end this is what keeps them not just subscribing but watching this video and then going to the next one and next one next one
YOU1000000044_S0001688	because your videos are amazing i love drones who does not my god and your movement of it is amazing definitely i
YOU1000000044_S0001689	all the elements are there and like i say once again to what you are editing best way to make it easier for self lay all your files out in your editor
YOU1000000044_S0001690	cut out all the bad parts right away what you do not need what looks bad if you have 20 seconds and 5 of its jittery cut out the jittery and start from there
YOU1000000044_S0001691	and see what you can put together
YOU1000000044_S0001692	of course you are saying bottle caps that you are just taking the sd card basically putting it in the computer and uploading
YOU1000000044_S0001693	it is a great way of doing it
YOU1000000044_S0001694	but if you want those viewing hours that these are little details that count a lot and would make a world of difference
YOU1000000044_S0001695	just even a 10 minute work on your video would would make a difference i promise you yeah you know miss you start now i
YOU1000000044_S0001696	you have all the elements already have everything else already working for you 10 minutes and it is going to be so much worth it
YOU1000000044_S0001698	try it for your next video and then get back to us and and and see how it went okay
YOU1000000044_S0001700	i see lots of people have drones here maverick as well
YOU1000000044_S0001701	like that you guys are getting in matt cook or for oregon 0 i am so glad to have you back tonight and yeah i knew you were wanting to get more into the details of stuff like that i
YOU1000000044_S0001703	and and please you have any questions as well like i say i do not know if we can answer them all you do some nice work and
YOU1000000044_S0001704	but anything or any advice for us as well or for anybody here to everybody we are just sharing thoughts and stuff like that and
YOU1000000044_S0001705	that is the nice part about this it is nothing formal i
YOU1000000044_S0001706	for sure if anybody else want to jump in and have any advice and please
YOU1000000044_S0001707	again if anybody have not subscribed yet to bottlecaps go over do that if you like his videos
YOU1000000044_S0001708	and please view the videos yes the videos they are really really beautiful
YOU1000000044_S0001710	00 matt here to your to call you are too kind yeah but thank you so much i mean we are just learning as we go and
YOU1000000044_S0001711	and literally that is what we were saying about caps is we are just watching every youtube tutorial there is
YOU1000000044_S0001712	i know we go on a lot about peter mckinnon yes he is canadian so we are a little biased
YOU1000000044_S0001713	but what we liked about him and a lot of people say 0 he is just a kc copycat he is not
YOU1000000044_S0001714	the thing he is doing that casey did not do casey was all about flashed i am not knocking him and hey he did great for it and
YOU1000000044_S0001715	but he does not hold a candle in the wind when it comes to actual cinematography casey is an amazing storyteller
YOU1000000044_S0001716	they are all great their own rights i am not turning it into a pissing contest between them all i am just saying is for what we do we really appreciate while peter does it and
YOU1000000044_S0001717	that guy i swear to god could take video blowing his nose and turned into a cinematic event yeah from the tissue to gets in the garbage you would be hooked on every moment of it and
YOU1000000044_S0001718	that is a talent
YOU1000000044_S0001719	and that is what it is is looking through and that is why i say we are cutting out all the bad jittery shots
YOU1000000044_S0001720	that is what takes somebody imagine if you were at a concert hearing your favorite singer of all time which we have and they have an off night
YOU1000000044_S0001721	it is they are singing the song and they are going the way it should be and then they hit that one flat note and then they get going again and they hit one more flat note and
YOU1000000044_S0001722	well they sung 100s of notes but it is that flat note that just knocks everything off kilter and that is not you being picky that is a physical element of us and
YOU1000000044_S0001724	yeah exactly it is it is the details yeah it is the details
YOU1000000044_S0001725	we lay out a video like i have been or examine with a picture and
YOU1000000044_S0001726	when we do a wedding she and i both spend a good couple of days
YOU1000000044_S0001727	a wedding for xenia usually involves 3000 to 4000 pictures taken in 8 hours that is no joke
YOU1000000044_S0001728	so it is a week just weeding out what pictures are horrible right away yeah this is blurry yeah that is shaky yeah i will take 15 of the same shot the
YOU1000000044_S0001729	any photographer is going to tell you that calling out the photos after the event is probably the most tedious and most boring task
YOU1000000044_S0001730	and i do not want to do it so ball caps i do not like pulling my photos
YOU1000000044_S0001731	but in order to get to the part that i do like doing and to get the end results of the pictures i have to
YOU1000000044_S0001732	so i spend hours and hours of cooling those 1000s and 1000s of pictures to get through them and choose the ones that i am liking and clients are going to like
YOU1000000044_S0001733	when we are shooting the wedding the same for me i mean i have seen myself in
YOU1000000044_S0001735	sometimes close to 2 sd cards full and those are 64 gig cards so there is a lot of footage to go through and you know
YOU1000000044_S0001736	and it is tedious and video sometimes even worse because at least before you can kind of jump you know with your viewer on the jpeg viewer to at least get rid of the bad ones right away and
YOU1000000044_S0001737	i got to watch these things in 4 k that suck up so much juice out of a computer just to get in 2 minutes down the road realize just how horrible the whole thing was
YOU1000000044_S0001738	because i have shot 30 the church i have shot it 30 different ways in that angle and 15 ways in this angle
YOU1000000044_S0001739	it is a nice takes me a night just to do one building sometimes that that is the price we pay for trying to get the best shot out of it and
YOU1000000044_S0001740	and will weed through them and i have seen myself have to go back and dig through my scraps again because i am short on time
YOU1000000044_S0001741	i need to angle or once i got in the editor i am realizing 0 my god that was bad at the end i thought this one was good i
YOU1000000044_S0001742	so i got a chop it there and then find something else to piece in between or it does it is it
YOU1000000044_S0001743	i have what drives me the craziest is a shot that is 12nd away from matching with the music
YOU1000000044_S0001744	and do i slow it down is that going to look hokey or do i have to scrap it all and put in 2 shots or find a better shot to fit
YOU1000000044_S0001745	it is mixing and matching it is it is like playing tetris for a couple of days i
YOU1000000044_S0001747	yeah and of course you know you do not have to go into the deep editing of the stuff if that is not what you want to do but sometimes just a light touch is great
YOU1000000044_S0001748	yeah there is a happy medium and all this
YOU1000000044_S0001749	and then also what we are doing a customer will be watching so we are kind of having to keep ourselves in check and then we are going to have to
YOU1000000044_S0001750	and we are our own worst critics i mean we constantly we said the other night are telling each other that
YOU1000000044_S0001751	80% of it is our work and the other 20% is telling the other one that they are going too far into this and you got to just accept it and move on and
YOU1000000044_S0001752	you know it is like a good bowl of soup just a little bit of salt is going to make a world of a difference
YOU1000000044_S0001753	and it is the little touches that make watch lots of people who do tutorials and again just look for great ideas
YOU1000000044_S0001754	there is so many out there that is what we use all the time and it does make a difference it really does and they are doing it step by step so you always got a good reference
