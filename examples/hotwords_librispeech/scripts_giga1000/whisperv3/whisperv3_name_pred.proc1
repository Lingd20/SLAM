POD1000000005_S0000034	KIM WAS NOT DOWN WITH THE CRITIQUE.
POD1000000005_S0000109	THEY PACKED IT WITH CHEAP, SKIMPY TEEN CLOTHES THAT THEY BOUGHT FROM L.A.'S KOREAN AMERICAN GARMENT MANUFACTURERS, LIKE THE KIND MR. KIM SOLD.
POD1000000005_S0000207	WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT MR. CHANG OVERSAW BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND STRATEGY, WHILE MRS. CHANG RAN THE MERCHANDISING SIDE OF THINGS ONE FLOOR BELOW. THEIR ADULT DAUGHTERS, LINDA AND ESTHER, SERVED AS THEIR DEPUTIES.
POD1000000005_S0000209	MR. CHANG HAD TO REVIEW EVERY SINGLE REAL ESTATE CONTRACT AND WAS INVOLVED WITH THE OPENING OF EVERY NEW STORE, WHICH AT THE PACE THAT THEY WERE EXPANDING IS A HUGE RESPONSIBILITY.
POD1000000005_S0000336	IN A WAY, GIVHAN SAYS, FAST FASHION IS KIND OF BRILLIANT WHEN IT'S DONE RIGHT.
POD1000000005_S0000403	LIKE THIS ONE FROM BEAUTY VLOGGER LAUREN GIRALDO.
POD1000000005_S0000429	WHILE THE CHANGS ARE NO LONGER BILLIONAIRES, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY THEY DIDN'T REACH SOME TYPE OF AMERICAN DREAM.
POD1000000005_S0000437	SPECTACULAR FAILURES IS A PRODUCTION OF AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA. IT'S WRITTEN AND HOSTED BY ME, CORRUPT TOP AFICIONADO LAUREN OBER.
POD1000000005_S0000439	OUR EDITOR IS BARGAIN HUNTER PHYLLIS FLETCHER.
POD1000000005_S0000443	CHRISTINA LOPEZ IS OUR AUDIENCE ENGAGEMENT EDITOR AND LAUREN DEE IS OUR EXECUTIVE PRODUCER.
POD1000000005_S0000444	CONCEPT DEVELOPED BY TRACY MUMFORD.
POD1000000005_S0000448	WE'VE GOT A SUPER FUN LIST OF SOURCE MATERIAL. AND FINALLY, THANKS TO THE ULTRA CHIC ROBIN GAVON FOR LETTING SLOBS LIKE US IN HER OFFICE.
POD1000000005_S0000449	WHAT DO YOU THINK OF WHITNEY'S OUT? WHO LOOKS BETTER TODAY, ME OR WHITNEY? SAY ME.
POD1000000011_S0000015	BUT OF COURSE I AM SURE, CHRIS. I AM THE COUNT.
POD1000000011_S0000020	ELMO THINKS THE COUNT MADE A LITTLE MISTAKE.
POD1000000011_S0000026	AND YOU KNOW WHAT, COREY? THAT MEANS HE'S PRETTY SIMILAR TO YOU AND ME.
POD1000000011_S0000035	WHAT SHOULD ELMO AND THE COUNT DO NEXT, THE COUNT?
POD1000000011_S0000056	YOU'RE LISTENING TO NPR'S LIFE KIT FOR PARENTING WITH SESAME WORKSHOP. I'M ANYA KAMENETZ. I'M NOT AFRAID OF A CORNY JOKE.
POD1000000011_S0000081	YEAH, ROSEMARY SAYS, THINK ABOUT THE FUN ACTIVITIES THAT CAN BACK UP AND REINFORCE WHAT THEY'RE LEARNING IN SCHOOL.
POD1000000011_S0000096	WE SHOULD ALSO SAY, ANYA, ABOUT A THIRD OF THE KIDS AT THIS SCHOOL SPEAK SPANISH AT HOME.
POD1000000011_S0000097	THAT'S RIGHT. AND AT THE PRESCHOOL, WE SAT DOWN WITH ONE OF THE LEAD RESEARCHERS, SUDHA SWAMINATHAN, AND SHE HELPED US UNDERSTAND A LOT MORE ABOUT HOW TO GROW CHILDREN WHO LOVE MATH.
POD1000000011_S0000099	INSTEAD, SWAMINATHAN SAYS, THINK SMALL. SHE'S A PROFESSOR IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AT EASTERN CONNECTICUT STATE, AND HER SPECIAL FOCUS IS ON EARLY MATH LEARNING.
POD1000000011_S0000100	AND SUDA AND HER COLLEAGUES HAVE DONE LOTS OF RESEARCH TO SEE WHAT KINDS OF CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES LEAD TO BETTER PERFORMANCE IN MATH LATER ON.
POD1000000011_S0000116	NAMING THE SHAPES IN BOTH ENGLISH AND IN SPANISH, WHEN WE PLAYED THIS TAPE FOR ROSEMARY, SHE SAID,
POD1000000011_S0000135	YOU PROBABLY REMEMBER THE KAI AND COREY. THEY'RE PERFECT FOR HITTING YOUR FRIENDS.
POD1000000011_S0000203	REMEMBER, SUDA WARNED US
POD1000000011_S0000217	WE ARE SITTING AT A ROUND TABLE AND I COULD ASK YOU, ANYA, WHAT'S THE SHAPE OF THIS TABLE?
POD1000000011_S0000219	I MEAN, SO IT'S, BUT A BETTER QUESTION WOULD BE TO SAY, ANYA, WHY DID YOU CHOOSE THE CIRCLE FOR OUR TABLE?
POD1000000011_S0000228	AND THE TEACHER, CARLA ALAMO, WAS A MASTER. SHE JUST BACKED OFF AND LET HIM DO HIS THING BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING?
POD1000000011_S0000272	SUDA ACTUALLY TOLD US THIS IS A GOOD TIP FOR PARENTS TO TRY TOO. YOU CAN MAKE A MISTAKE AND GIVE YOUR KIDS A CHANCE TO CORRECT YOU WITH MATH OR, YOU KNOW, ANYTHING ELSE.
POD1000000011_S0000288	GREAT. SAME, SAME. EVEN STEVEN.
POD1000000011_S0000318	I ALSO HAVE TO THANK THE MATH LEARNING RESEARCHERS WHO HELPED ME PROCESS MY MATH ANXIETY, JOE BOWLER, MANUELA PAXER, AND ANN DOWKER.
POD1000000011_S0000319	LAST BUT NOT LEAST, SPECIAL THANKS TO ROSEMARY TRULIO, KEN SCARBOROUGH, AND ALL OUR FRIENDS AT SESAME WORKSHOP.
POD1000000012_S0000109	WE'RE BACK. THIS IS COREY.
POD1000000012_S0000113	SO I REMEMBER AS A CHILD WATCHING COOKIE MONSTER AND JUST BEING LIKE, WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS MANIAC?
POD1000000012_S0000161	ROSEMARY EXPLAINED THAT SELF REGULATION ISN'T JUST ABOUT TREATS. SELF REGULATION IS A SET OF SKILLS THAT HELPS US REACH OUR GOALS.
POD1000000012_S0000185	BUT KEN FUJITA, WHO WE HEARD FROM EARLIER, WHO SAID COOKIE MONSTER WAS A MANIAC,
POD1000000012_S0000190	SO BY SOFTWARE, KEN'S TALKING ABOUT THE SKILLS AND THE STRATEGIES THAT PARENTS CAN HELP KIDS PRACTICE TO IMPROVE THEIR SELF REGULATION.
POD1000000012_S0000234	JUST LIKE I DID WITH COOKIE MONSTER. I KNOW IT WAS SILLY AND PROBABLY SOUNDED A LITTLE RIDICULOUS,
POD1000000012_S0000258	THE EXPERIMENT HAS BEEN REPEATED MANY, MANY TIMES SINCE IT WAS FIRST DONE BY WALTER MISCHEL IN THE LATE 1960S.
POD1000000012_S0000263	AND BY HOT, KEN FUJITA MEANS INTENSE OR URGENT, SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO ACT ON RIGHT NOW. BUT, HE SAYS...
POD1000000012_S0000290	CORY, LOOK OVER THERE!
POD1000000012_S0000294	OH, I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE. NICE. NICE CABINETS.
POD1000000012_S0000301	RIGHT. AND EVERY PARENT KNOWS, LIKE ROSEMARY SAYS, YOU NEED TO HAVE A LONG LIST OF POTENTIAL DISTRACTIONS UP YOUR SLEEVE, RIGHT?
POD1000000012_S0000346	OKAY, YOU GUYS, COOKIE HAS BEEN WAITING ALL THIS TIME. OH, NO.
POD1000000012_S0000376	AND I'M SO PROUD OF YOU, COOKIE MONSTER.
POD1000000012_S0000378	BUT ME ALSO APPRECIATE COOKIE!
POD1000000012_S0000387	WELL, I MISS COOKIE MONSTER. I FELT LIKE I COULD TELL HIM ANYTHING.
POD1000000012_S0000428	AND YOU KNOW, ON LIFE KIT, WE LIKE TO BRING YOU A COMPLETELY RANDOM TIP ON EVERY EPISODE. THIS TIME, WE WENT TO ONE OF COOKIE MONSTER'S NEIGHBORS.
POD1000000013_S0000225	I'VE TRIED TO DO IT BUT YOU AND AMANDA HAVE ACTUALLY DONE IT AND I THINK THAT IS AMAZING.
POD1000000013_S0000230	THANK YOU, ROB. THANK YOU.
POD1000000015_S0000001	HELLO, THIS IS ROB BEHRENS HERE, WELCOMING YOU TO ANOTHER EPISODE OF RADIO OMBUDSMAN.
POD1000000015_S0000260	THAT'S LOVELY. ROSEMARY, IT'S BEEN A GREAT PRIVILEGE FOR US TO LISTEN TO YOU.
POD1000000016_S0000052	A PIRATE SHIP BY THE NAME OF WHITE LION SAILS INTO THE BAY HERE.
POD1000000016_S0000056	FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE, I'M NICOLE HANNAH JONES. THIS IS 1619.
POD1000000016_S0000147	THE CIVIL WAR HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR ABOUT A YEAR, AND ABRAHAM LINCOLN IS WORRIED BECAUSE THE WAR IS NOT GOING WELL. AND BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOING WELL, HE'S FEELING LIKE HE MIGHT HAVE TO DO SOMETHING DRASTIC.
POD1000000016_S0000172	AND TO MAKE IT EVEN WORSE, LINCOLN THEN TELLS THEM THAT IT'S THEIR FAULT THAT THE COUNTRY IS FIGHTING A CIVIL WAR AT ALL.
POD1000000016_S0000183	AFTER EVERYTHING THAT BLACK AMERICANS HAVE BEEN THROUGH IN THIS COUNTRY, THAT THEY DIDN'T IMMEDIATELY TAKE UP LINCOLN'S OFFER AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE AND START OVER IS REALLY AN ASTOUNDING TESTIMONY TO THEIR BELIEF IN THE AMERICAN IDEALS.
POD1000000016_S0000237	AND THE BUS DRIVER GETS OFF THE BUS AND THEN CALLS AND TELLS WOODARD THAT HE NEEDS TO GET OFF THE BUS AS WELL. SO WOODARD GETS OFF THE BUS AND BEFORE HE CAN EVEN UTTER A WORD,
POD1000000016_S0000248	SO WATERS' BEATING WAS NOT AT ALL UNUSUAL. WORLD WAR II HAD DONE EXACTLY WHAT MANY WHITE PEOPLE HAD FEARED.
POD1000000016_S0000251	WOULD FIND THAT THIS ACTUALLY MADE THEM A TARGET OF SOME OF THE MOST SEVERE VIOLENCE. BUT WHAT WAS UNUSUAL WAS WHAT HAPPENED AFTER. WOODARD'S CASE WAS PICKED UP BY THE NAACP, AND THEY TAKE HIM ON A BIT OF A TOUR,
POD1000000019_S0000021	BILLY SWAN IS ONE. JEANNIE C. REILLY, THE SINGER OF HARBOR VALLEY PTA, IS THE OTHER ONE. THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE ALIVE WHO'VE HAD THEIR FIRST SINGLE GO NUMBER ONE COUNTRY AND POP.
POD1000000019_S0000040	ONE DAY, JEANNIE SAYS, SHE GETS A LETTER FROM THE GREAT PEDAL STEEL PLAYER WELDON MYRICK, WHO'D SEEN HER SING AT A LOCAL JAMBOREE AND JUST HAD TO WRITE HER TO SAY THAT HE THOUGHT OF JEANNIE SINGING EVERY TIME HE HEARD CONNIE SMITH SING
POD1000000019_S0000045	UP IN NASHVILLE, THEY DRIVE AROUND LOWER BROADWAY TO LOOK AT TOOTSIE'S ORCHID LOUNGE, ERNEST TUBBS RECORD SHOP, AND THE RYMAN AUDITORIUM. ALL THAT COUNTRY MUSIC TOURIST STUFF.
POD1000000019_S0000051	JEANNIE C. REILLY'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY IS REALLY THE ONLY SOURCE I CAN USE FOR THIS STUFF, AND IT'S SUPER SKETCHY TO SAY THE LEAST.
POD1000000019_S0000065	IN THE VERY NEXT PARAGRAPH, SHE SAYS SHE'D ALREADY STUDIED THE LYRICS, WHICH SHE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN FROM SHELBY. WHY DOES SHE HAVE SHELBY PRESENTING THE LYRICS TO HER HERE WITH SUCH POMP, AS IF FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME?
POD1000000019_S0000074	IF THEY'LL COME BY THE OFFICE OF SUREFIRE, HIS PUBLISHING COMPANY. A FEW DAYS LATER, THEY DROP INTO THE SUREFIRE OFFICE AND MEET JOHNNY RUSSELL, WHO IS A STAFF SONGWRITER THERE. JOHNNY RUSSELL LISTENS TO HER SING.
POD1000000019_S0000075	THEY DECIDE TO HAVE HER GO IN THE STUDIO THAT NIGHT AND THE NEXT TO RECORD A FOUR SONG DEMO TAPE. THEY HAVE A PHOTOGRAPHER TAKE SOME PICTURES OF HER. JEANNIE THINKS ALL OF THIS MEANS SHE'S ON HER WAY TO BECOMING A STAR.
POD1000000019_S0000084	AS THEY CROSS THE CITY LIMIT SIGN INTO NASHVILLE, SHE AND MICKEY MAKE A PACT THAT THEY'LL ALWAYS TRAVEL TOGETHER AS A FAMILY, THE BABY TOO. QUOTE, SHOW BUSINESS MIGHT CHEW UP OTHER FOLKS AND SPIT THEM ONTO THE SIDEWALK, BUT NOT US. WE'D SHOW THEM.
POD1000000019_S0000090	BASED OUT OF NEW YORK. PHIL BLACKMAN IS OUR BIG BAD WOLF. UNCLE JOHNNY BOUGHT A GAS STATION RIGHT BEFORE JEANNIE AND MICKEY MOVED TO NASHVILLE. SO THAT'S WHERE MICKEY STARTS WORKING.
POD1000000019_S0000095	25 MILES AWAY FROM WHERE JEANNIE WAS FROM. SHE APPARENTLY THINKS SHE CAN MEET THIS LADY, SAY, HEY, I'M FROM TEXAS TOO, AND GET A RECORD DEAL OR SOMETHING.
POD1000000019_S0000096	SHE HAS NO IDEA WHERE THIS LADY'S OFFICE IS SUPPOSED TO BE. SHE JUST STARTS WALKING INTO PUBLISHING COMPANIES TO FIND OUT IF THAT LADY WORKS THERE OR NOT. WHEN SOME KID ASKS IF SHE'S TRYING TO GET A DEMO TAPE HEARD, JEANNIE PULLS OUT HER TAPE AND THE KID TAKES A LISTEN.
POD1000000019_S0000097	HE SEEMS TO LIKE IT, PLAYS IT FOR HIS BOSS, WHO SAYS IT SOUNDS TOO MUCH LIKE LORETTA LYNN, AND THEY TELL JEANNIE TO KICK ROCKS. SHE GOES BACK TO HER CAR WITH THE BABY AND CRIES, THEN DECIDES TO DRIVE OVER TO THE GAS STATION WHERE MICKEY WORKS.
POD1000000019_S0000104	BUT JERRY THINKS THEY CAN GET MONUMENT TO BACK OFF THE NAME CHANGE IF THEY STAY ON IT. GENIE GETS SHOWN OFF AT A DJ CONVENTION, INTRODUCED TO EVERYONE IN TOWN AS TINA STEVENS, THE NEXT GIRL THEY'RE GONNA SIGN AND DO BIG THINGS WITH.
POD1000000019_S0000107	REMEMBER THIS SENTENCE, THAT DJ PAUL PERRY SENDS GENIE'S DEMO AND A PROMO PICTURE TO PHIL BLACKMAN IN NEW YORK CITY.
POD1000000019_S0000115	THEN, ONE DAY IN BLACKMAN'S APARTMENT, JEANNIE'S LAYING NAKED ON THE COUCH AFTER HAVING SEX WITH HIM WHEN SHE'S SUDDENLY BLINDED BY FLASHES OF BRIGHT LIGHT. THERE'S BLACKMAN HOLDING A CAMERA WITH A STROBE FLASH ATTACHMENT.
POD1000000019_S0000126	HE HIRES JEANNIE AS A SECRETARY, WHICH IS WHERE SHE'S WORKING, WHEN A SONGWRITER FRIEND ASKS HER TO SING ON THE DEMO OF HIS NEW SONG HE WANTS SHELBY SINGLETON AT PLANTATION RECORDS TO HEAR.
POD1000000019_S0000127	I COULDN'T FIND A RECORDING OF GENIE SINGING IT, BUT I FOUND THE SONGWRITER SINGING IT HIMSELF, SO YOU CAN TRY TO IMAGINE WHAT GENIE WOULD HAVE SOUNDED LIKE ON THE DEMO.
POD1000000019_S0000128	CLARK BENTLEY'S OLD TOWN DRUNK COMES OUT ON PLANTATION RECORDS IN 1968.
POD1000000019_S0000135	SHE'S THINKING ABOUT THAT WHEN PERRY SAYS IF JEANNIE DOESN'T TAKE THIS DEAL, THEN HE CAN'T REPRESENT HER ANYMORE. IT'S NOT GONNA GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS. SHE SIGNS THE PAPERS, GOES HOME, AND CRIES ABOUT IT.
POD1000000019_S0000141	SHELBY TELLS JEANNIE THEY'LL USE HER MIDDLE INITIAL TO MAKE HER STAND OUT MORE FROM THE OTHER JEANNIES AND ADD AN I TO HER FIRST NAME SO PEOPLE KNOW IT'S NOT PRONOUNCED JEAN.
POD1000000019_S0000142	FINDING OUT SHE REALLY DOESN'T HAVE TO BE RONDA RENE, PLUS THE FACT THAT EVERYONE IN THE ROOM SEEMS CERTAIN SHE JUST CUT A MASSIVE HIT SONG, IMPROVES GENIE'S MOOD.
POD1000000019_S0000151	WHEN SHE FINDS OUT SHE'S THE ONE PAYING FOR ALL OF THAT. GENIE AND MICKEY DON'T NEED HELP SPENDING THE MONEY. THEY'RE THROWING DOWN MAJOR CASH ON CLOTHING, JEWELRY, HAIRSTYLES, CARS, ALL THE USUAL ROCK STAR STUFF.
POD1000000019_S0000155	ANYWAY, PRETTY SOON, JEANNIE STARTS SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME WITH HER MANAGER, PAUL PERRY. ONE NIGHT, THEY'RE SITTING AROUND HOLDING HANDS, AND PERRY'S TALKING ABOUT HOW CAREFUL JEANNIE HAS TO BE NOW THAT SHE'S ON TOP.
POD1000000019_S0000159	MADE FROM HER OLD SESSIONS WITH HIM. NOW THAT GENIE'S GOT THE BIGGEST HIT IN THE NATION, THESE RECORDS WILL SELL.
POD1000000019_S0000161	BLACKMAN'S GOT A MANILA ENVELOPE LIKE YOU SEE IN EVERY MOVIE ABOUT A PRIVATE DETECTIVE, AND HE WANTS TO GIVE IT TO JEANNIE, BUT FIRST SHE'S GOTTA SIGN A NEW PIECE OF PAPER SAYING SHE WON'T SUE HIM FOR RELEASING HER OLD RECORDINGS.
POD1000000019_S0000170	WHICH IS ALSO THE EXPLANATION FOR WHY JEANNIE WOULD BE IN LAS VEGAS OPENING UP FOR JOHNNY PAYCHECK WHEN ALL SHE'S SUPPOSEDLY DONE IS ONE BARELY RELEASED SINGLE FOR BLACK ROSE RECORDS.
POD1000000019_S0000184	SOMETHING PHYSICAL FOR JEANNIE TO PLAY PRETEND WITH TO KEEP THE WHOLE CHARADE GOING. IT WAS CALLED YOU WRITE THE MUSIC, CREDITED TO GENE RILEY, QUOTE UNQUOTE, RELEASED ON LITTLE DARLING RECORDS IN 1967.
POD1000000019_S0000188	NOW HERE ARE THE TWO BIG QUESTIONS I DON'T THINK I CAN OR SHOULD EVEN TRY TO ANSWER. DID AUBREY MAYHEW AND JEANNIE C. REILLY HAVE AN AFFAIR?
POD1000000019_S0000201	SHE GETS TO PICK WILD MOUNTAIN BERRIES WITH GLEN CAMPBELL ON TV.
POD1000000019_S0000208	IF YOU'RE STARTING TO GET THE IDEA THAT GENIE'S ALWAYS THOUGHT OF AS LITTLE MORE THAN A PUPPET FOR THE PEOPLE BEHIND THE SCENES OF HER CAREER, I WOULD SAY THAT SEEMS ACCURATE.
POD1000000019_S0000213	AND WHILE THE SONG IS ACTUALLY SUNG BY THE DAUGHTER CHARACTER WHO DOESN'T DRESS THAT WAY, EVERY TIME YOU SEE JEANNIE C. REILLY, SHE LOOKS LIKE MRS. JOHNSON.
POD1000000019_S0000228	FROM THE NIGHTMARE SHE DESCRIBES, YOU'D EXPECT THAT TO BE THE ONLY TIME SHE EVER TOKED UP. BUT THIS VIDEO CLIP OF RALPH EMERY INTERVIEWING HER SEEMS TO SUGGEST OTHERWISE.
POD1000000019_S0000234	THE ONLY OTHER WOMAN TO DO THAT IN THE 1900S IS DOLLY PARTON WITH 9 TO 5 IN 1981, MAKING JEANNIE THE FIRST WOMAN TO EVER DO IT. IF YOU DON'T COUNT THE FARCE WITH LITTLE DARLING RECORDS,
POD1000000019_S0000252	HERE'S HER DOING IT ON THE JOHNNY CASH SHOW.
POD1000000019_S0000261	LIKE THE LA TIMES POP CRITIC ROBERT HILBURN, WHO REVIEWED A GENIE C. REILLY CONCERT IN 1971 UNDER THE HEADLINE, LITTLE TALENT.
POD1000000019_S0000268	SHE ALWAYS HAD A CRACK BAND BEHIND HER, THE HARPER VALLEY EXPRESS. THEY USUALLY MADE THE TEMPO OF EVERYTHING FASTER TO REALLY PUT SOME GAS IN THE TANK AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO DENY GENIE'S CHARISMA AS A PERFORMER.
POD1000000019_S0000274	NOT ONLY WAS JEANNIE NOT A ONE HIT WONDER, SHE MADE GOOD ALBUMS WITH VERY LITTLE FILLER. CHECK OUT THIS ALBUM TRACK FROM 1972, NEVER EVEN RELEASED AS A SINGLE, CALLED WITHOUT YOU.
POD1000000019_S0000277	WITHOUT YOU IS FROM GENIE'S SECOND ALBUM ON MGM AFTER LEAVING PLANTATION RECORDS IN 1972 IN WHAT SHELBY SINGLETON CALLED A BREACH OF CONTRACT.
POD1000000019_S0000291	AKA THE EXACT OPPOSITE AUDIENCE OF THE ONLY REASON ANYONE KNOWS JEANNIE C. REILLY'S NAME, HARPER VALLEY PTA. A SONG HIGHLY CRITICAL OF HYPOCRISY IN SOCIAL GROUPS WITH HARDCORE CONSERVATIVE VALUES.
POD1000000019_S0000301	NEXT MOVE, ASK TOM T. HALL TO WRITE ANOTHER HARPER VALLEY PTA, A THING HE'D BEEN VERY VOCAL ABOUT HIS RELUCTANCE TO DO, BUT ALSO HE'S A BIG SOFTIE.
POD1000000019_S0000355	AND THAT DISCLAIMER IS WRITTEN BY JEANNIE'S CO AUTHOR, WHO I ALSO FAILED TO MENTION IS A PREACHER. HERE'S WHAT HE WRITES, QUOTE, TO KEEP FROM HURTING SOME OF THE FOLKS JEANNIE LOVES, WE HAVE CHANGED THE NAMES OF SEVERAL PEOPLE IN THE BOOK.
POD1000000019_S0000374	ONE THING THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING THAT WE HEARD TODAY IS, UNLIKE, AS YOU HEARD IN THE SECOND EPISODE OF THE PODCAST, LORETTA LYNN'S RECORDING OF THE PILL...
POD1000000019_S0000378	I THINK MONEY TALKS. I THINK THAT BY THE TIME ANY OF THOSE WOULD BE BUZZKILLS STARTED PAYING ATTENTION, THIS SONG WAS ALREADY THE NUMBER ONE POP SONG IN AMERICA. AND IT WENT NUMBER ONE POP BEFORE IT WENT NUMBER ONE COUNTRY.
POD1000000019_S0000379	EVERY MAJOR RECORD LABEL IN NASHVILLE HAD BEEN FALLING ALL OVER ITSELF FOR 15 YEARS TRYING TO DO THAT. THEY'D HAVE MADE JEANNIE C. REILLY THE MAYOR OF NASHVILLE IF SHE DID IT A SECOND TIME.
POD1000000019_S0000387	THAN TWO YEARS LATER IN 1971, AS GENIE STATED IN THE BOOK. THIS IS REALLY AGGRAVATING FOR ME TO HAVE TO TALK ABOUT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THIS IS JUST MY FAULT.
POD1000000021_S0000006	THAT'S TRINA EDWARDS. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HER HUSBAND, EDWIN EDWARDS, THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF LOUISIANA.
POD1000000021_S0000018	EDWARD SERVED EIGHT YEARS ON CORRUPTION CHARGES.
POD1000000021_S0000042	THERE WERE SIX GRAND JURY INVESTIGATIONS DURING EDWARDS' FIRST TERM
POD1000000021_S0000046	EDWARDS LED LOUISIANA FOR EIGHT YEARS, LEAVING OFFICE IN MARCH 1980.
POD1000000021_S0000047	THE ONLY THING STOPPING HIM FROM BEING GOVERNOR FOR LIFE WERE TERM LIMITS THAT EDWARDS HIMSELF HAD PUSHED FOR.
POD1000000021_S0000058	EDWARDS WAS RIGHT TO BELIEVE THAT 1983 ELECTION WAS A LOCK. HE'D WIN IT WITH 62% OF THE VOTE.
POD1000000021_S0000061	IF THERE'S ONE THING LOUISIANA GOVERNOR ELECT EDWIN EDWARDS KNOWS, IT'S HOW TO HAVE A GOOD TIME, EVEN WITH A $4 MILLION CAMPAIGN DEFICIT STARING HIM DOWN.
POD1000000021_S0000062	EDWARDS CHARTERED TWO JUMBO JETS, ANNOUNCED HE WAS GOING TO PARIS, AND INVITED ANYONE WILLING TO CONTRIBUTE $10,000 TO COME ON ALONG.
POD1000000021_S0000096	WHEN I ASKED EDWARDS ABOUT THE CASE, HE DIDN'T SOUND ALL THAT SORRY.
POD1000000021_S0000111	BUDDY ROMER WAS A CONGRESSMAN FROM NORTH LOUISIANA.
POD1000000021_S0000121	THERE WOULD BE NO RUNOFF. ROMER WOULD BE THE NEXT GOVERNOR OF LOUISIANA.
POD1000000021_S0000123	BUT THAT'S NOT HOW EDWARD SAW IT. DROPPING OUT OF THE RACE, THAT WAS THE FIRST STEP IN HIS COMEBACK PLAN.
POD1000000021_S0000133	IN 1991, DAVID DUKE WAS AT THE HEIGHT OF HIS POWERS.
POD1000000021_S0000137	THIS IS SLOW BURN. I'M JOSH LEVINE. EPISODE 5, THE ROAD TO HELL.
POD1000000021_S0000140	THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT SIMPLISAFE HAS BEEN A DECADE FIGHTING AGAINST.
POD1000000021_S0000148	SIMPLISAFE WAS NAMED BEST OVERALL HOME SECURITY OF 2020 BY US NEWS AND WORLD REPORT
POD1000000021_S0000153	IT WAS 1930, AND THE GOVERNOR WAS HUEY LONG.
POD1000000021_S0000157	LONG WAS SHOT AND KILLED AT THE STATE CAPITOL FIVE YEARS LATER.
POD1000000021_S0000159	YES, LONG WAS A CORRUPT DICTATOR. AND SURE, HE ORCHESTRATED A KIDNAPPING.
POD1000000021_S0000161	EDWIN EDWARDS CARRIED ON HUEY LONG'S TRADITION OF ECONOMIC POPULISM.
POD1000000021_S0000162	LIKE LONG, EDWARDS USED MONEY SNATCHED FROM BIG OIL TO BUILD BRIDGES AND HOSPITALS.
POD1000000021_S0000167	IN REALITY, DUKE'S BRAND OF POPULISM HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH SHRINKING GOVERNMENT.
POD1000000021_S0000169	DUKE'S MESSAGE, THE JOURNALIST JOHN MCGINNIS WROTE, HELD A LOT OF APPEAL FOR THE CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN OF HUEY LONG'S OLD VOTERS.
POD1000000021_S0000172	THEY WANT TO SEE WHERE HUEY LONG WAS SHOT AND WHERE DAVID DUKE SITS.
POD1000000021_S0000181	ROMER'S BIG INITIATIVE WAS A PLAN TO MODERNIZE THE STATE'S APPROACH TO TAXATION.
POD1000000021_S0000184	ROMER WAS ADAMANT THAT HIS FISCAL REFORM PLAN WAS NOT A TAX INCREASE.
POD1000000021_S0000187	DAVID DUKE, THEN A NEWLY ELECTED STATE LEGISLATOR, WAS ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S MOST OUTSPOKEN CRITICS.
POD1000000021_S0000197	DIGGING LOUISIANA'S ALREADY TROUBLED ECONOMY EVER DEEPER IN DEBT, AND FORCING REFORM MINDED GOVERNOR BUDDY ROMER TO SCRAMBLE HIS WAY OUT OF A NEW FINANCIAL CRISIS.
POD1000000021_S0000206	BUT STROTHER, WHO'D HELPED ROMER WIN IN 1987, WAS AVAILABLE TO WORK ON THE GOVERNOR'S RE ELECTION CAMPAIGN.
POD1000000021_S0000219	ROMER ACTUALLY LIKED THE RUBBER BAND IDEA.
POD1000000021_S0000225	IN HIS STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS, ROMER APOLOGIZED TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR HIS INFLEXIBILITY AND INSENSITIVITY.
POD1000000021_S0000228	FOR STROTHER, THE SELF HELP STUFF WAS BAD, BUT WHAT HAPPENED NEXT WAS WORSE.
POD1000000021_S0000231	I SAW MARY MATLIN, A WHOLE BUNCH OF HIGH ECHELON REPUBLICANS SITTING AROUND THE TABLE, BY THE DINING ROOM TABLE WITH BUDDY.
POD1000000021_S0000242	IDEOLOGY ASIDE, ROMER THOUGHT THE MOVE WAS SMART STRATEGY.
POD1000000021_S0000243	EDWIN EDWARDS WAS GOING TO GRAB VOTES FROM HIS LEFT, NO MATTER WHAT.
POD1000000021_S0000244	ROMER FIGURED THAT BRANDING HIMSELF A REPUBLICAN WOULD HELP STAVE OFF RIGHT WING CHALLENGERS WHO MIGHT THREATEN HIS REELECTION.
POD1000000021_S0000245	THE STATEWIDE POLL SHOWED THAT THE TOP THREE CANDIDATES ARE DUKE, EDWARDS AND MYSELF.
POD1000000021_S0000250	DEMOCRATS IN LOUISIANA FELT BURNED BY ROMER. AND REPUBLICANS, INCLUDING STATE PARTY OFFICIALS, WEREN'T SURE THEY COULD TRUST HIM EITHER.
POD1000000021_S0000252	RESENTED THAT ROMER HADN'T INCLUDED HIM IN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE PARTY SWITCH. AND ROMER, FORGETTING THE LESSONS OF ALL I EVER NEEDED TO KNOW I LEARNED IN KINDERGARTEN, CURSED OUT NUNGESSER RATHER THAN TRYING TO APPEASE HIM.
POD1000000021_S0000254	THAT ENDORSEMENT WOULDN'T GO TO BUDDY ROEMER OR DAVID DUKE.
POD1000000021_S0000260	THEN DUKE WAS EGGING THEM ON, YOU KNOW, TO DISRUPT THINGS.
POD1000000021_S0000263	BUDDY ROMER HAD TRIED TO CONSOLIDATE THE CONSERVATIVE VOTE.
POD1000000021_S0000296	BY 1991, THE OPEN PRIMARY WAS OPEN IN A WAY EDWARDS MAYBE HADN'T ANTICIPATED.
POD1000000021_S0000305	DUKE COULD PASS THE BUCKET WITH IMPUNITY DURING HIS 1990 SENATE CAMPAIGN BECAUSE THAT WAS A FEDERAL RACE.
POD1000000021_S0000307	HAMSTRUNG BY THESE NEW RULES, DUKE HELD FEWER RALLIES AS A CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR THAN WHEN HE RAN FOR THE SENATE. AND EDWARDS' FUNDRAISING SLOWED TO A TRICKLE.
POD1000000021_S0000312	RAYMOND STROTHER SAW IT UP CLOSE DURING THE 1987 RACE.
POD1000000021_S0000326	THE PROBLEM FOR ROMER WAS THAT A LOT OF SWING VOTERS FELT DRAWN TO ANOTHER CANDIDATE,
POD1000000021_S0000343	IT WASN'T CLEAR, BASED ON POLLING, HOW WHITE PEOPLE IN LOUISIANA WERE RESPONDING TO DUKE'S LATEST ATTEMPT AT IMAGE MANAGEMENT.
POD1000000021_S0000344	SUSAN HOWELL HAD BEEN STRUGGLING FOR YEARS TO GET A HANDLE ON DUKE'S VOTERS.
POD1000000021_S0000355	THIS BECAME A RESEARCH CHALLENGE FOR HOWELL AND HER GRADUATE STUDENTS. HOW COULD THEY GET DAVID DUKE'S SILENT ARMY TO BREAK ITS SILENCE?
POD1000000021_S0000365	ROMER'S POLITICAL CONSULTANT, RAYMOND STROTHER, HEARD THAT SPECULATION.
POD1000000021_S0000373	WHEN I GOT EDWARDS ON THE PHONE,
POD1000000021_S0000378	DID YOU OR YOUR SUPPORTERS DO ANYTHING TO HELP DUKE GET INTO THE RUNOFF WITH YOU?
POD1000000021_S0000384	THE EDWARDS CAMPAIGN, IT TURNS OUT, HAD A TOTALLY DIFFERENT SECRET ALLIANCE.
POD1000000021_S0000391	DEHEMACOURT SAYS THE TWO OF THEM HATCHED A PLAN.
POD1000000021_S0000404	DID GOVERNOR EDWARDS KNOW ABOUT THIS STRATEGY?
POD1000000021_S0000407	WHEN I ASKED EDWARDS ABOUT THE ALLIANCE, HE TOLD ME HE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
POD1000000021_S0000408	IN JOHN MCGINNIS' BOOK ABOUT THE 1991 CAMPAIGN, CLYDE HOLLOWAY'S CAMPAIGN ADVISOR, BRIAN WAGNER, ALSO DENIED MAKING ANY SUCH DEAL.
POD1000000021_S0000421	HE ALSO THINKS EDWARDS IS TOTALLY CORRUPT.
POD1000000021_S0000423	I'M NOT SAYING IT'S IMMORAL, IT'S JUST AMORAL, COMPLETELY WITHOUT REGARD TO THE MORALITY OF TRYING TO HELP DAVID DUKE GET INTO THE RUNOFF AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT WOULD BE GOOD OR BAD FOR THE STATE OF LOUISIANA.
POD1000000021_S0000430	BUT WHAT IF THEY WERE WRONG? WHAT IF DAVID DUKE WON?
POD1000000021_S0000446	ON OCTOBER 19, 1991, DUKE'S FANS GATHERED AT THE PONTCHARTRAIN CENTER IN HIS HOME TERRITORY OF JEFFERSON PARISH.
POD1000000021_S0000467	DAVID DUKE WAS IN THE RUNOFF WITH 32% OF THE VOTE.
POD1000000021_S0000469	EDWIN EDWARDS. BUDDY ROMER'S POLITICAL CONSULTANT, RAYMOND STROTHER, KNEW HIS MAN WAS GOING TO COME IN THIRD.
POD1000000021_S0000475	BUDDY ROEMER FINISHED FIVE POINTS BEHIND DAVID DUKE.
POD1000000021_S0000478	AND TONIGHT THE PEOPLE SPOKE AND THEY SAID, BUDDY, THANKS, BUT YOU DIDN'T DO ENOUGH. AND I THINK THAT'S FAIR.
POD1000000021_S0000479	WHEN MICHELLE SCHAUER STARTED WORKING ON THE CAMPAIGN, SHE'D BEEN INSPIRED BY BUDDY ROEMER'S ENERGY.
POD1000000021_S0000492	SCHAUER AGREED TO MEET WITH DUKE'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER, HOWIE FARRELL.
POD1000000021_S0000494	SHOWER WANTED TO BE A CAMPAIGN MANAGER SOMEDAY.
POD1000000021_S0000499	SHE'D ALSO MAKE A LOT OF PHONE CALLS ON BEHALF OF DAVID DUKE, USING A LIST SHE'D BROUGHT WITH HER FROM THE ROMER CAMPAIGN.
POD1000000021_S0000530	SPECIAL THANKS TO JORDAN HIRSCH, JESSICA SEIDMAN, AND SLATE'S CHOW TU, KATIE RAYFORD, LAURA BENNETT, ALLISON BENEDICT, AND JARED HOLT.
POD1000000023_S0000000	HELLO EVERYONE, I'M STEPHEN WEST. THIS IS PHILOSOPHIZE THIS. THANK YOU TO EVERYONE THAT CONTINUES TO SUPPORT THE SHOW ON PATREON, AND A SPECIAL THANK YOU TO THOSE OF YOU THAT UPPED YOUR PLEDGE DURING THESE UNCERTAIN TIMES.
POD1000000023_S0000011	KANT GOES MORE IN THE DIRECTION OF A PRIORI FACTS DERIVED FROM REASON. BUT EITHER WAY, THESE THINKERS ARE IN THEIR OWN WAY TRYING TO USE REASON TO ARRIVE AT A UNIVERSAL THAT GUARANTEES HUMAN BEINGS ARE BORN WITH NATURAL RIGHTS.
POD1000000023_S0000026	BUT RORTY WOULD EXTEND THAT TUTELAGE TO THE RATIONAL DOGMA THAT WAS TO COME IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE OF HOW OVERAMBITIOUS WE WERE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT ABOUT WHAT RATIONALITY COULD PRODUCE.
POD1000000023_S0000031	THIS WASN'T AN ANTI ENLIGHTENMENT IDEA AT ALL. TO RORTY, THIS WAS THE PROJECT OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT LEFT TO PLAY ITSELF OUT.
POD1000000023_S0000038	MAYBE IT IS POINTLESS TO TRY TO DO OUR BEST IMPRESSIONS OF LOCKE AND KANT AND TO TRY TO ACCESS THE UNIVERSE THROUGH REASON.
POD1000000023_S0000048	BUT TO RORTY, THIS WOULD BE MAKING THE SAME MISTAKE THAT LOCKE AND KANT MADE IN OUR EXAMPLE FROM BEFORE ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS.
POD1000000023_S0000070	YOU KNOW, DESCARTES' FAMOUS WORK, A TREATISE CONCERNING WHY DRUGS SHOULD BE LEGALIZED AND WHY YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE YOUR CELL PHONE ON AN AIRPLANE. NO. NO.
POD1000000023_S0000084	LANGUAGE MEDIATES OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH REALITY. YOU CAN'T ACCESS REALITY WITHOUT LANGUAGE. BUT TO RORTY, IT EVEN GOES ONE STEP FURTHER THAN THIS.
POD1000000023_S0000093	SO IT SHOULD BE SAID, RORTY'S NOT TALKING ABOUT ORDINARY LANGUAGE WHEN HE WRITES THAT. HE'S TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET DEEP INTO HERE IN A MINUTE. BUT I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS COMPARISON HE'S MAKING HERE,
POD1000000023_S0000159	YOU'D LIVE YOUR DAY TO DAY LIFE NOT LIKE PYRRHO FROM ANCIENT ATHENS, YOU'RE NOT GONNA WALK IN FRONT OF CARS DOUBTING WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE ACTUALLY THERE. YOU'D HAVE A SORT OF WORKING THEORY, A FINAL VOCABULARY THAT YOU USE TO FUNCTION.
POD1000000023_S0000192	THE WAY RICHARD RORTY WALKS THIS LINE OF NATURE AND CULTURE IS PARTIALLY THROUGH HIS BEAUTIFUL USE OF PRAGMATISM. RORTY WOULDN'T SAY YOU SHOULD CARE LESS. HE WOULDN'T SAY YOU SHOULD CARE MORE.
POD1000000024_S0000010	I'M ANNE FRIEDMAN, CO HOST OF THE PODCAST, CALL YOUR GIRLFRIEND, AND A JOURNALIST.
POD1000000024_S0000023	HERE'S AMINATOU.

POD1000000026_S0000009	I'M KEVIN SYSTROM, FORMER CEO AND CO FOUNDER OF INSTAGRAM.
POD1000000026_S0000043	IT'S SO GOOD TO HAVE LIKE A MIC IN YOUR LIFE WHERE YOU CAN ASK THEM A QUESTION AND THEY JUST ALWAYS HAVE THE BEST ANSWER
POD1000000026_S0000142	AND KEVIN WAS LIKE, NO, WE DON'T NEED ANOTHER SERVER.
POD1000000026_S0000218	AND I REMEMBER I HAD DINNER WITH KEVIN. I WAS LIKE, HEY MAN, LIKE I FEEL LIKE IT MIGHT BE TIME FOR ME TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT, WHICH IS LIKE A HARD CONVERSATION, LIKE IT'S A SCARY CONVERSATION TO HAVE.
POD1000000026_S0000222	THEN I HAD THE INTERESTING EXPERIENCE OF DOING PART OF KEVIN'S JOB FOR A FEW MONTHS BECAUSE HE WENT OUT ON PATERNITY LEAVE.
POD1000000026_S0000283	KEVIN SYSTROM AND MIKE KRIEGER ARE PARTNERS.
POD1000000026_S0000287	PARTNERS IS MADE BY ME, RISHIKESH HIRWAY.
POD1000000028_S0000053	FINALLY NADIA COMES UP AND DOES HER INCREDIBLE ROUTINE. THAT'S WHERE THE CROWD EXPLODED. I MEAN THAT WAS EXPLOSION. EXPLOSION OF SUPPORT, EXPLOSION OF LOVE AND EXCITEMENT AND I'M LOOKING THROUGH THE CORNER OF MY EYES
POD1000000028_S0000062	MY NAME IS GEZA POZSÁR. THAT'S THE HUNGARIAN PRONUNCIATION. IN ENGLISH IT'S LIKE, GEZA POZÁR. SO, GEZA POZSÁR.
POD1000000028_S0000076	NADIA WAS THE DIAMOND. SHE WAS THE TREASURE OF ROMANIA. SHE WAS THE BEST PRODUCT ROMANIA EVER HAD. NADIA PUT ROMANIA ON THE MAP. AFTER NADIA, EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT THERE IS ROMANIA.
POD1000000028_S0000084	NADIA'S WIN WAS THE ULTIMATE POLITICAL VALIDATION FOR THE COUNTRY'S LEADER, NIKOLAI CEAUSESCU.
POD1000000028_S0000091	PROPAGANDA IS POWER IN A REGIME LIKE CEAUSESCU'S, AND THERE WAS NO BETTER PROPAGANDA THAN CELEBRATING AND REWARDING THE SUCCESS OF ITS OLYMPIC CHAMPION AND THE COACHES WHO HAD BROUGHT ROMANIA SUCH HIGH HONOR.
POD1000000028_S0000094	SHE GOT THE CAR, BELLA GOT TWO CARS.
POD1000000028_S0000095	NADIA AND THE CAROLIS WERE GIFTED CARS. THEIR TAXES WERE CUT IN HALF. AS THE REST OF THE COUNTRY DEALT WITH CRUSHING RATIONS, THE ROMANIAN COACHES AND THEIR CHOREOGRAPHER HAD MEALS DELIVERED TO THEM FOR FREE.
POD1000000028_S0000109	BELLA CAME TO THE SPORT NOT KNOWING MUCH ABOUT GYMNASTICS, BUT THAT DIDN'T REALLY MATTER BECAUSE HE WAS ESSENTIALLY TEACHING HIMSELF THE BASICS OF THE SPORT BY TEACHING LITTLE KIDS WHO DIDN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT GYMNASTICS THEMSELVES.
POD1000000028_S0000122	WHEN NADIA WON GOLD AT 14 YEARS OLD, IT SEALED THE TREND TOWARD CHILD ATHLETES.
POD1000000028_S0000132	BEFORE THE 1976 GAMES WERE EVEN OVER, THE ROMANIANS WERE FOCUSED ON REPEATING AND ADDING TO THAT SUCCESS. AND BECAUSE BELLA WAS SEEN AS RESPONSIBLE FOR NADIA,
POD1000000028_S0000134	BELA ALWAYS LIKED TO WORK IN THESE TYPES OF SMALL PLACES WHEN HE HAD A LOT OF CONTROL.
POD1000000028_S0000139	MY REAL FULL NAME IS GERTRUDE AMELIA EBERLE.
POD1000000028_S0000140	TRUDY KOLAR WAS A GYMNAST FOR ROMANIA'S NATIONAL TEAM FROM 1976 TO 1983. SHE COMPETED UNDER HER MIDDLE AND MAIDEN NAMES, EMILIA EBERLE.
POD1000000028_S0000144	IT WAS BELLA CAROLI.
POD1000000028_S0000145	I SAW NADIA ON TV AND I LOVE GYMNASTICS. AND I SAID, I ALWAYS TOLD MY MOM, OH MY GOSH, I WISH I COULD TRAIN WITH HER, BUT THAT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN. AND THEN WE GOT A PHONE CALL AND I WAS LIKE, I SAID, OKAY, MOM, LET'S GO.
POD1000000028_S0000149	SHE SAID, OKAY, HONEY, I NEED TO LEAVE NOW. I NEED TO CATCH THE TRAIN. I SAID, BYE, MOM. I GAVE HER A KISS, AND THEN BELLA SHOWED HER THROUGH THE HALLWAY TO THE DOOR.
POD1000000028_S0000151	AND BELLA COMES AND HE SMACKED ME OVER THE FACE SO HARD THAT I FLEW ON MY BED. AND HE OPENED THE DRAWER WHERE MY BREAD WAS IN. AND HE SAID, IF I EVER SEE YOU AGAIN EATING ANYTHING LIKE THIS, I WILL KILL YOU.
POD1000000028_S0000170	HE WANTED EVERYTHING FAST, QUICK, YOU KNOW, PUT THEM BACK TOGETHER FAST, YOU KNOW. IF THE DOCTOR DIDN'T FOLLOW BELA'S ORDERS, YOU KNOW, THEY ARE OUT.
POD1000000028_S0000183	WHEN MARTA WAS IN THE GYM, SHE COULD ALSO BE PHYSICALLY ABUSIVE.
POD1000000028_S0000191	THE GIRLS' ONLY RESPITE FROM BELLA AND MARTA WAS THEIR DANCE CLASSES WITH GEZA.
POD1000000028_S0000195	WHEN HE WAS TOGETHER WITH BELLA AND MARTA, HE WAS A TOUGH GUY BECAUSE HE HAD TO LOOK LIKE A TOUGH GUY BECAUSE HE WOULD HAVE PROBABLY LOST HIS JOB IF HE DIDN'T.
POD1000000028_S0000202	OH, BELLA.
POD1000000028_S0000214	NADIA HAD TO SETTLE FOR SILVER IN THE ALL AROUND, BUT WENT ON TO WIN GOLD ON FLOOR AND BEAM. TRUDY WON A SILVER MEDAL ON THE UNEVEN BARS.
POD1000000028_S0000216	SO WHEN WE MADE THE BIG BROUHAHA ABOUT NADJA'S SCORING ON B, THE GOVERNMENT DIDN'T LIKE IT.
POD1000000028_S0000224	IT WAS THE NADIA 81 TOUR WHEN BELLA AND THE ROMANIAN WOMEN'S NATIONAL TEAM TOURED WITH THE AMERICAN TEAM IN MARCH 1981.
POD1000000028_S0000247	THEY WERE TIRED OF THE SCRUTINY. IN ROMANIA, EVERYONE WAS WATCHED ALL THE TIME. VELA HAD FANTASIZED ABOUT WHAT A LIFE IN THE UNITED STATES COULD BE.
POD1000000028_S0000256	THAT WE ALL WENT OUT THE DOOR PROBABLY I WALKED LIKE 10 STEPS AND BELLA SAYS TRUDY
POD1000000028_S0000258	TRUDY FOLLOWED BELLA'S ORDERS AND WENT BACK TO THEIR ROOM WITH MARTA.
POD1000000028_S0000275	SO WE FINALLY GOT ON A BUS AND THE SECURITY GUY WHO WAS ALREADY GREEN ON HIS FACE WAS JUST ALL GREEN. HE SAID, WHERE'S BELLA? YOU KNOW IT. I SAID, I DON'T KNOW. HOW SHOULD I KNOW? MAYBE THEY DIDN'T COME BACK FROM THE STORE YET. I HAVE NO IDEA.
POD1000000028_S0000276	THERE WAS NO SIGN OF BELLA, MARTA, OR GEZA.
POD1000000028_S0000316	HEAVY METALS WAS REPORTED BY ME, ALYSSA ROENICK, AND BONNIE FORD. PRODUCERS ANDREW MAMBO AND MEREDITH HODNOT.

POD1000000030_S0000006	WE GOT A HOLD OF IAN HUNTER, PROFESSOR OF EXERCISE SCIENCE AT BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY, AS HE WAS WITH SOME ATHLETES TRAINING AT BYU'S INDOOR TRACK. HE TOLD US THE SHOES WORK BY COMBINING FOAM IN THE SOLE WITH A CARBON FIBER PLATE.
POD1000000030_S0000045	SO WE'LL LINK YOU TO THAT. AND A VOICE YOU HEAR ON MARKETPLACE TECH FROM TIME TO TIME, NICK THOMPSON, EDITOR IN CHIEF OF WIRED MAGAZINE, IS ALSO A KEEN MARATHONER.
POD1000000031_S0000010	DAVID EGAN WITH CBRE SAYS RIGHT ABOUT NOW, WAREHOUSE WORKERS ARE GETTING BURIED.
POD1000000031_S0000027	THAT WAS DAVID EGAN WITH CBRE.
POD1000000031_S0000040	BUT I THINK REALLY THE NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION THAT I'M TAKING AWAY FROM ALL OF THIS IS JUST TO BUY LESS STUFF. I'M JACK STEWART, AND THAT'S MARKETPLACE TECH.

POD1000000042_S0000398	BUT THEY HATE HER A LITTLE LESS THAN THEY HATED TRUMP, I GUESS.
POD1000000042_S0000402	WE'LL SEE HOW IT PICKS UP. SPEAKING OF WHICH, WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT AFTER WE GET TO THE SPONSORS. AND I BELIEVE TO GO TO MEYER IS GOING TO JOIN US HERE WITH THAT. MIKE, WE GREATLY APPRECIATE YOU BEING ON THE SHOW.
POD1000000042_S0000466	YEAH, BECAUSE I DIDN'T FIND OUT. DAN AND I, COLLECTIVELY, SOMEBODY TALLIED IT UP. WE DID 58 HOURS WORTH OF PODCASTS IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS. I SLEPT. I WAS PRETTY SICK. IT WAS SATURDAY. MY BODY JUST GAVE OUT. I WAS PRETTY SICK.
POD1000000042_S0000526	AND THERE'S SOMETHING THAT POPS UP ON YOUTUBE. IF YOU SAY THE WORD ELECTION NOW THAT SAYS THE AP HAS CALLED THE ELECTION FOR JOE BIDEN AND FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THIS. AND IT WAS POINTED OUT BY THE LISTENERS AND I WAS
POD1000000042_S0000598	WE BARELY, LIKE DONALD TRUMP GOT BEAT, WE DIDN'T WIN. KINDA LIKE THE REPUBLICANS PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE DONE AS WELL LAST TIME.
POD1000000042_S0000611	WELL, HOW DO YOU PICK, HOW DO YOU DECIDE LIKE WHAT, YOU KNOW, HOW DO YOU DECIDE LIKE WHEN DONALD TRUMP DOES SOMETHING? I MEAN, YOU KNOW, YOU GOT TO FORGIVE HIM FOR THE SHIT
POD1000000042_S0000622	TRUMP WAS THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE OF THAT. AND THEIR RESPONSE WAS TO JUST LOSE THEIR FUCKING MINDS. NOW, THAT ISN'T ALWAYS THE CASE. SO LET'S SAY YOU'RE RIDING A TRAIN THROUGH THE CITY.
POD1000000042_S0000628	WELL, IT'S HARD. I GET WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, BUT IT'S HARD NOT TO DO THAT WHEN AOC AND HER COLLEAGUES ARE TALKING ABOUT MAKING LISTS OF PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT TRUMP. I WAS NOT A TRUMP SUPPORTER.
POD1000000042_S0000648	NO, REPUBLICANS ARE DEFINITELY GOING TO FLIP THE HOUSE IN 2022 BECAUSE LET'S JUST BE REAL HONEST ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. EVEN IF ANYTHING BIDEN WAS GOING TO PUSH WOULD HAVE MADE SOME POSITIVE DENT.
POD1000000042_S0000658	BUT WHAT I HOPE IS, IS I HOPE IF ANYTHING, IF ANYTHING, THIS NEXT FOUR YEARS, LIKE OBVIOUSLY THEY PROBABLY WON'T PASS MUCH. THEY PROBABLY WON'T CHANGE MUCH. I THINK WE KNOW THAT. BUT MAN, MY HOPE FOR THIS COUNTRY IS, IS THAT IF HE DOES ANYTHING,
POD1000000042_S0000665	YEAH, BUT HE NEVER WOULD HAVE. HE'S DONALD TRUMP, RIGHT? SO THERE'S NO HE DOESN'T HAVE THAT IN HIS TOOLBOX.
POD1000000042_S0000683	WHICH IS WHAT DONALD TRUMP GAVE ALL THE MONEY TO AND SAYS, HEY MAN, WE HAVE IT, WE'VE GOT THE CURE. AND WE'RE 90% RIGHT NOW, WE'RE GONNA HAVE ABOUT 50 MILLION OF THESE GUYS OUT INTO THE WORLD IN JANUARY.
POD1000000042_S0000688	LET'S BE REAL ABOUT THIS. THE REASON DONALD TRUMP DIDN'T GET REELECTED ISN'T BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THE WAY HE TALKS. RIGHT. BECAUSE HE TALKS.
POD1000000042_S0000727	YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN KILLING IT, MAN. AND IT'S A FUN SHOW. WE ENJOY IT. FOR D'ANTHONY D'ANTHONY HOLLOWAY, DAKOTA MEYER, I'M ROSS PATTERSON. WE ARE THE DRINKING BROS. GOOD NIGHT, EVERYONE.
POD1000000043_S0000009	WELCOME TO POD SAVE AMERICA. I'M JON FAVREAU.
POD1000000043_S0000080	AND THERE WERE A BUNCH OF EPIDEMIOLOGISTS, SCIENTISTS AND OTHERS SAYING THAT FAUCI'S TIMELINE WAS WAY TOO OPTIMISTIC FOR 12 TO 18 MONTHS, 11 MONTHS. THAT'S WHAT THIS VACCINE CAME IN, 11 MONTHS.
POD1000000043_S0000084	THIS SECTION IS JOHN BASICALLY BEING SO MAD AT LIKE A SERIES OF ARTICLES IN THE ATLANTIC THAT WERE SO ANNOYING OVER THE COURSE OF MANY MONTHS. IT WAS LIKE THE DOOM AND GLOOM PUBLICATION OF CHOICE FOR SEVERAL MONTHS.
POD1000000043_S0000100	FAILING TO MAKE ANY HEADWAY, FAILING TO ACTUALLY STAND UP TO TRUMP, DOING THE MORALLY REPREHENSIBLE AND EASY THING. BUT HERE'S THIS GUY FAUCI, WHO I THINK WE WILL LOOK BACK AND SAY DID AN EXTRAORDINARY THING OF SERVING HIS COUNTRY
POD1000000043_S0000118	AND SO THAT'S WHY, YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST IT'S HORRIBLE THAT WE HAVE TO READ THESE STORIES OVER AND OVER AGAIN OF TRUMP'S POLITICIZING THE PROCESS WHEN IF HE HAD TO SHUT UP AND STEPPED BACK AND LET THE PROCESS WORK, THINGS WOULD BE BETTER.
POD1000000043_S0000150	YEAH, GRANDPA JOE.
POD1000000043_S0000169	ON WONKA'S BULLSHIT GUEST WORKER PROGRAM.
POD1000000043_S0000204	I'M NOT SAYING THAT THEY SHOULD DO WHAT TRUMP SEEMS TO BE ATTEMPTING TO DO WITH HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER, WHICH IS, YOU KNOW, USE THE DPA OR USE THE GOVERNMENT TO SAY, HEY, PFIZER, ALL YOUR DOSES ARE FOR US. THEY'RE NOT FOR OTHER COUNTRIES. LIKE THAT'S IMMORAL.
POD1000000043_S0000231	AND I DON'T KNOW. HOPEFULLY WE'LL FIGURE OUT WHO DID IT. I BET THE EMAIL WAS LIKE UNOPENED IN JARED'S INBOX SOMEWHERE WITH ONE OF HIS, YOU KNOW, HIS COLLEGE ROOMMATES, YOU KNOW, TOLD HIM NOT TO DO IT OR SOMETHING.
POD1000000043_S0000252	BECAUSE HE CARES MORE ABOUT PRIVATE EQUITY BACKED INSURANCE COMPANY PROFITS THAN REGULAR PEOPLE. MCCONNELL IS ONE OF THE WORST PEOPLE IN POLITICAL LIFE, IN POLITICAL HISTORY. HE'S DISGUSTING. HE'S A CORPORATE STOOGE. HE'S CYNICAL.
POD1000000043_S0000257	BUT THIS IS THIS IS WHAT DRIVES ME NUTS IS LIKE, AND YOU KNOW WHY MITCH MCCONNELL IS GOING TO GET HIS WAY ON THIS AND THIS DEAL IS PROBABLY GOING TO PASS WITH ALL OF THE SHIT THAT HE WANTS IN IT OR DOESN'T WANT IN IT IS BECAUSE HE'S GOT THE FUCKING NUMBERS AND HE'S GOT DONALD TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE. LIKE I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW.
POD1000000043_S0000258	BERNIE SANDERS SAID THE DEAL IS BAD AND WE SHOULDN'T SUPPORT THE DEAL. AND LIKE, I AGREE WITH HIM IN THE SENSE THAT THE DEAL IS FUCKING BAD. THE BIPARTISAN COMPROMISE IS BAD.
POD1000000043_S0000260	WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE CHOICE HERE? LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO NEGOTIATE A BETTER PACKAGE WITH THESE REPUBLICANS. WHO ARE YOU GOING TO GET TO VOTE FOR MORE MONEY? YOU'RE GOING TO GET SUSAN COLLINS AND MITT ROMNEY TO VOTE FOR MORE RUN IN LISA MURKOWSKI. NO, THEY SAID THIS IS AS BEST THAT THEY WOULD DO.
POD1000000043_S0000261	AND IF YOU DON'T TAKE THE DEAL AND WE DON'T WIN GEORGIA, WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET A BETTER DEAL WHEN JOE BIDEN'S PRESIDENT. AND JOE BIDEN'S NOT GOING TO HAVE A MECHANISM TO FORCE A BETTER DEAL BECAUSE MITCH MCCONNELL IS GOING TO SIT THERE AND SAY, FUCK YOU. I HAVE THE NUMBERS. I DON'T HAVE TO PASS A DEAL.
POD1000000043_S0000264	TO TWO TRILLION TO ONE FIVE. NOW WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO ONE. WHAT I DON'T KNOW IS WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY REPLACE THE STATE AND LOCAL AID AS IT WAS DRAFTED WITH DIRECT PAYMENTS. DOES THAT BECOME SOMETHING THAT GETS PEOPLE LIKE BERNIE BACK ON BOARD?
POD1000000043_S0000265	I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE, MAYBE YOU TRY THAT. I MEAN, BERNIE IS ONE THING, BUT LIKE, LIKE JOSH HAWLEY OR SOME OF THESE REPUBLICANS WHO WANT DIRECT PAYMENTS. YEAH, I WOULD, I WOULD TRY TO GET AS MUCH IN THERE AS I COULD, YOU KNOW, AND I WOULD TRY TO PUSH MORE DIRECT PAYMENTS FOR SURE. BUT LIKE AT THE END OF THE DAY,
POD1000000043_S0000301	I HATE TO SAY IT, GUYS. WELL, ONE OBVIOUS THING THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL IS WINNING THESE GEORGIA RUNOFFS. BUT THEN I HATE TO SAY IT, BUT IT WOULD IT WOULD ALSO HELP, I THINK, IF BRIAN KEMP SURVIVED HIS PRIMARY CHALLENGE.
POD1000000043_S0000305	BECAUSE IF LIKE, YOU KNOW, I HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT A LOT OF THE CONCERN OVER DONALD TRUMP SUCCESSFULLY OVERTURNING THIS ELECTION IS IS A LITTLE OVERHYPED.
POD1000000043_S0000308	BUT THEN IN THE 2024 ELECTION, IF THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE OR IF IT'S TRUMP PULLS WHAT TRUMP PULLED AGAIN, IT GOES TO CONGRESS AND NOW YOU HAVE A REPUBLICAN HOUSE.
POD1000000043_S0000330	POSITIVE AMERICA IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY DOORDASH. BETWEEN NEVER ENDING LAUNDRY CYCLES AND INCOMING EMAILS, YOU'VE GOT PLENTY ON YOUR TO DO LIST. GIVE YOURSELF ONE LESS THING TO WORRY ABOUT AND LET DOORDASH TAKE CARE OF YOUR NEXT MEAL. MAYBE YOU WANT CHINESE, THEY WANT PIZZA?
POD1000000043_S0000331	AND SOMEONE IS CRAVING FRO YO, AS THEY CALL IT. THERE'S SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE ON DOORDASH AND YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T REALLY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE TOGETHER. YOU CAN ALL GET YOUR OWN THING. EMILY AND I FREQUENTLY DO THAT. WE CAN'T AGREE ON THE SAME KIND OF FOOD,
POD1000000043_S0000333	AND YOUR FOOD WILL BE LEFT SAFELY OUTSIDE YOUR DOOR WITH THE NEW CONTACTLESS DELIVERY DROP OFF SETTING. WITH OVER 300,000 PARTNERS IN THE U.S., PUERTO RICO, CANADA, AND AUSTRALIA, YOU CAN SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL GO TOS OR CHOOSE FROM YOUR FAVORITE NATIONAL RESTAURANTS LIKE CHIPOTLE,
POD1000000043_S0000358	EVERY TIME YOU BUY A PAIR OF SHOES, CARIUMA PLANTS A PAIR OF TREES IN THE BRAZILIAN RAINFOREST. HOW ABOUT THAT? TOMMY. WHAT? WHAT CARIUMA COLORWAY WILL YOU BE GIFTING YOUR IN LAWS THIS HOLIDAY SEASON? THAT WAS VERY SPECIFIC.
POD1000000043_S0000391	LIKE THIS IS IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK BECAUSE DEMOCRATS HAVE A MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE AND WILL VOTE DOWN THE OBJECTION. AND THERE ARE NOW ENOUGH SENATORS IN THE SENATE WHO HAVE SAID THAT JOE BIDEN IS PRESIDENT OF REPUBLICAN SENATORS.
POD1000000043_S0000438	THAT TRUMP AND HIS SUPPORTERS SHOULD WORK TOGETHER WITH BIDEN ON MAKING PROGRESS, WHICH WAS SURPRISING BECAUSE I'M LIKE THESE SAME PEOPLE WHO THINK THE ELECTION IS NOT LEGITIMATE, YOU KNOW, 60% OF THEM THINK NEVER WORK WITH BIDEN ON ANYTHING. SO THAT'S STILL A MAJORITY.
POD1000000043_S0000461	POD SAVE AMERICA IS A CROOKED MEDIA PRODUCTION. THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER IS MICHAEL MARTINEZ. OUR ASSOCIATE PRODUCER IS JORDAN WALLER. IT'S MIXED AND EDITED BY ANDREW CHADWICK. KYLE SEGLIN IS OUR SOUND ENGINEER.

POD1000000044_S0000002	I AM ROBO GOLDSTEIN.
POD1000000044_S0000041	HI, JENNY. OH, THERE HE IS. OH, HELLO THERE.
POD1000000044_S0000060	GONNA BE THIS WAY WITH JENNY. BECAUSE YOU REHEARSED IT.
POD1000000044_S0000070	ACCORDING TO ALVIN, ONCE YOU'VE DISCOVERED THIS OPTIMAL PERSONHOOD, YOU CAN SHAKE OFF WHAT OTHERS WANT AND LIVE ON YOUR OWN TERMS.
POD1000000044_S0000072	AND FOR THESE KINDS OF RADICAL RESULTS, ALVIN WAS GIVEN A LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD FROM THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION.
POD1000000044_S0000073	ONE PSYCHOLOGY TEXTBOOK EVEN GOES SO FAR AS TO DESCRIBE ALVIN AS BEING, QUOTE, AS IMPORTANT AS FREUD.
POD1000000044_S0000075	BUT THIS ISN'T A STORY ABOUT ALVIN'S PROFESSIONAL LIFE, HIS LIFE INSIDE THE OFFICE. THIS IS A STORY ABOUT ALVIN'S REAL LIFE.
POD1000000044_S0000098	AND AS THE FINAL CUSTODY HEARING APPROACHED, ALVIN'S FOCUS ON RACHEL INTENSIFIED. HE WANTED TO PROVE TO THE COURT THAT RACHEL WAS BETTER OFF WITH HIM. SO HE HAD ABOUT A HALF DOZEN SOCIAL WORKERS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS OFFER ASSESSMENTS.
POD1000000044_S0000110	SHE NEVER WAS ABLE TO ENJOY WHATEVER IT IS WE WERE DOING AT THE MOMENT. IT WAS ALWAYS, OH, IF ONLY RACHEL WERE HERE, WE COULD ALL BE TOGETHER. AND I'D BE SAYING, BUT WE'RE HERE NOW.
POD1000000044_S0000112	WHEN HE TURNED 13, JOHN INVITED RACHEL TO HIS BAR MITZVAH, BUT ALVIN WOULDN'T LET HER GO. RACHEL SENT A POEM INSTEAD.
POD1000000044_S0000121	SO WHEN ALVIN REFUSED JOHN YET AGAIN, RACHEL TOLD HER BROTHER TO COME VISIT HER INSTEAD. THEY HADN'T SEEN EACH OTHER IN EIGHT YEARS. WAS SHE THE SAME SISTER THAT YOU REMEMBERED?
POD1000000044_S0000132	AND TOGETHER, JOHN AND RACHEL MADE A SERIES OF DISTURBING DISCOVERIES. THE FIRST OF WHICH WAS THE SCRIPT.
POD1000000044_S0000149	THE SECOND THING DISCOVERED AMONG THE FILES WAS A LETTER FROM RACHEL TO HER MOM. IN IT, SHE BEGS JUDY TO LET HER LIVE WITH ALVIN. BUT THERE WERE TWO COPIES, ONE WRITTEN IN RACHEL'S HAND AND ONE WRITTEN IN ALVIN'S.
POD1000000044_S0000152	IN EVERY PHOTO FROM THAT PERIOD WITH HER MOTHER, RACHEL IS WEARING A FROWN.
POD1000000044_S0000178	HOW WAS ALVIN ABLE TO EXERT THIS KIND OF POWER OVER A SOCIAL WORKER, SOMEONE WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AN IMPARTIAL OUTSIDER? JOHN AND RACHEL COULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT.
POD1000000044_S0000179	BUT THAT NIGHT, WHEN RACHEL GOOGLED JOYCE, SHE WAS SHOCKED TO REALIZE THAT JOYCE HADN'T BEEN AN IMPARTIAL OUTSIDER AT ALL. JOYCE WAS A FAMILY FRIEND.
POD1000000044_S0000181	RACHEL RECOGNIZED JOYCE AS THE KIND, DARK HAIRED WOMAN WHOSE HOUSE SHE VISITED AS A CHILD.
POD1000000044_S0000206	SYLVIE AND ROBERT DISCOVER THAT THOUGH THEIR LIVES HAVE CHANGED, THEIR FEELINGS FOR EACH OTHER REMAIN THE SAME.
POD1000000044_S0000210	I FIND JOYCE, THE SOCIAL WORKER'S FACEBOOK AND EMAIL ADDRESS RIGHT AWAY. AND I MESSAGED TO ASK IF SHE'D BE WILLING TO SPEAK WITH JOHN AND RACHEL ABOUT THEIR PARENTS' CUSTODY BATTLE. I DON'T HEAR BACK FOR SEVERAL WEEKS.
POD1000000044_S0000227	TED IS NOT ANYWHERE CLOSE TO CRYING.
POD1000000044_S0000230	TED, YOU'RE ON THE VERGE OF CRYING.
POD1000000044_S0000237	AS THE CREDITS ROLL, I LEARN THAT WHILE ALVIN THE THERAPIST IS ALVIN THE THERAPIST, TED THE PATIENT IS ACTUALLY BOB THE ACTOR.
POD1000000044_S0000250	IT SEEMED THERE WAS THE WAY THE ACTRESS WAS GIVEN TO TALKING ABOUT AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP, AND THEN THERE WAS THE WAY THAT ALVIN PREFERRED HER TO TALK ABOUT ONE. AND SO, THE ACTRESS WAS REPLACED, AND BOB WAS SHOWN HER VIDEO, TO ILLUSTRATE WHAT ALVIN DID NOT WANT.
POD1000000044_S0000266	JOHN IS SEATED IN A CHAIR, HIS POSTURE UPRIGHT. RACHEL IS SITTING BACK ON A COUCH.
POD1000000044_S0000282	JOYCE SETTLES INTO AN ARMCHAIR.
POD1000000044_S0000297	JOYCE INHALES THROUGH CLENCHED TEETH, SHAKES HER HEAD.
POD1000000044_S0000305	JOYCE'S HUSBAND AT THE TIME WAS A COLLEAGUE OF ALVIN'S. THAT'S HOW SHE FIRST CAME TO KNOW ALVIN. HE AND HER HUSBAND BOTH TAUGHT IN THE LOCAL UNIVERSITY'S PSYCHOLOGY DEPARTMENT. JOYCE SAYS HER HUSBAND WOULD ALWAYS COME HOME WITH AL STORIES.
POD1000000044_S0000311	JOYCE RELATES THE ANECDOTE TO ILLUSTRATE THE KIND OF GUY ALVIN WAS. BUT JOHN HEARS SOMETHING ELSE IN THE STORY.
POD1000000044_S0000339	AT THAT POINT, JOYCE AND HER HUSBAND HAD JUST ARRIVED IN TOWN. WHILE HER HUSBAND TAUGHT AT THE UNIVERSITY, JOYCE DID NOT. SHE HOPED TO SOMEDAY, BUT SHE WAS STILL FAIRLY YOUNG.
POD1000000044_S0000431	RACHEL WILL LATER TELL ME THAT BECAUSE OF THE WAY HER DAD BRAINWASHED HER, SHE OFTEN CAN'T TRUST HER MEMORIES. SO IT FEELS GOOD THAT HER MEMORY OF JOYCE IS CORRECT. JOYCE IS NICE. BUT RACHEL IS NICE TOO, AND CAN SENSE HOW BADLY JOYCE IS FEELING.
POD1000000044_S0000440	AND I'VE BEEN WITH MY WIFE 37 YEARS, AND THANKFULLY NOW, YOU KNOW, RACHEL AND I CAME BACK TOGETHER ON OUR OWN, AND I'M VERY CLOSE WITH MY SISTER.
POD1000000044_S0000443	DAMAGE DONE TO US CAN OFTEN BECOME DAMAGE WE DO TO OTHERS. AND ON IT GOES. BUT WATCHING JOHN AND RACHEL, I'M STRUCK BY THE WAY THEY'RE BREAKING THAT CYCLE. NOT JUST IN THEIR LIVES, BUT RIGHT HERE IN THE ROOM.
POD1000000044_S0000451	WHEN JOHN FIRST BECAME A PSYCHOLOGIST, HE'D SEE ALVIN AT VARIOUS CONFERENCES WHERE ALVIN WAS RECEIVED AS A STAR.
POD1000000044_S0000473	WHEN I RAISED THE SUBJECT OF ALVIN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS KIDS, AND HOW THAT CONNECTED TO HIS OPTIMAL SELF, HOWARD SAYS HE CAN'T REALLY SPEAK TO THAT. ALVIN DIDN'T BRING UP HIS KIDS MUCH.
POD1000000044_S0000478	A LITTLE GIRL BARGES INTO JOYCE'S ROOM. SHE'S WEARING A LACY BLUE DRESS THAT'S EITHER A NIGHTGOWN OR A CINDERELLA COSTUME.
POD1000000044_S0000489	JOYCE, I'M SO APPRECIATIVE.
POD1000000044_S0000511	I'M XAVIER JERNIGAN.
POD1000000045_S0000006	AGAIN, THIS IS EPISODE 271. KATIE PROCTOR, WELCOME TO SORTA AWESOME. HOW ARE YOU?
POD1000000045_S0000025	OKAY, WELL, YOU GUYS, TRULY, KATIE HAS PICKED OUT SOME VERY FUN BOOKS. AND I WANT TO TELL YOU BEFORE WE GET TO OUR CONVERSATION LATER IN THE EPISODE, KATIE,
POD1000000045_S0000054	I DIDN'T, BUT I JUST LISTENED TO HER TALK TO BRENE BROWN.
POD1000000045_S0000059	SO HER MUSIC IS REALLY, YOU KNOW, IT'S PART OF MY CHILDHOOD. IT'S PART OF MY GROWING UP YEARS. DOLLY PARTON'S AMERICA IS A FANTASTIC PODCAST THAT I THOUGHT I LOVED DOLLY BEFORE I LISTENED TO THAT.
POD1000000045_S0000066	SHE'S GOT HOLLY JOLLY CHRISTMAS ON HERE. SHE ALSO HAS, YOU KNOW, LIKE I SAW MOMMY KISSING SANTA CLAUS. SHE HAS MARY DID YOU KNOW?
POD1000000045_S0000069	BUT DID YOU EXPECT MILEY CYRUS TO BE ON A CHRISTMAS ALBUM?
POD1000000045_S0000071	YEAH, IT REALLY IS. AND SHE ALSO HAS ANOTHER DUET WITH MILEY'S DAD, BILLY RAY ON HERE.
POD1000000045_S0000073	SO IT'S REALLY GREAT, YOU GUYS. IT'S ON SPOTIFY, IT'S ON APPLE MUSIC, AMAZON MUSIC, ALL THE PLACES THAT YOU LISTEN TO MUSIC. YOU CAN FIND A HOLLY DOLLY CHRISTMAS. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK FOR THE BONUS VERSION
POD1000000045_S0000087	OKAY, AWESOMES, I HAVE TOLD YOU BEFORE, I WILL SAY IT AGAIN. ONE OF THE MOST LIFE CHANGING DISCOVERIES THAT WE MADE THIS YEAR IS THERAGUN.
POD1000000045_S0000090	PLUS, DURING OUR BIG ICE STORM EARLIER THIS FALL, KYLE HURT HIS BACK. I WAS ABLE TO USE THE THERAGUN TO HELP HIM FIND RELIEF, AND IT SAVED US HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS IN VISITS TO A DOCTOR'S OFFICE.
POD1000000045_S0000112	WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IN JUST A LITTLE BIT, LIKE I SAID, KATIE DID PUBLISH HER FIRST BOOK THIS YEAR. IT'S A MIDDLE GRADE NOVEL. WE'RE GOING TO TALK ALL ABOUT THAT HERE IN JUST A FEW MINUTES.
POD1000000045_S0000113	SO I DEFINITELY WANT YOU GUYS TO STICK AROUND FOR THAT PART OF THE CONVERSATION. I CANNOT WAIT, KATIE, FOR US TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THAT HAS BEEN LIKE RELEASING A BOOK IN THE YEAR 2020. I'M SURE THAT HAS BEEN AN EXPERIENCE TOO.
POD1000000045_S0000123	OKAY, SO THE FIRST ONE THAT CAME TO MIND FOR THIS CATEGORY, I JUST READ IN SEPTEMBER, I THINK, AND IT IS CALLED THE INVISIBLE LIFE OF ADDIE LARUE.
POD1000000045_S0000126	THE AUTHOR IS V.E. SCHWAB. THIS BOOK HAS BEEN EVERYWHERE. IT WAS A BOOK OF THE MONTH PICK. THAT'S HOW I GOT IT. THE COVER IS GORGEOUS. IT'S BLACK. IT'S GOT THESE GOLD LETTERS. IT'S JUST BEAUTIFUL.
POD1000000045_S0000147	IT'S CALLED THE GIRL WITH THE LOUDING VOICE BY ABBY DERAY.
POD1000000045_S0000181	THE HOUSE IN THE CERULEAN SEA BY T.J. KLEIN.
POD1000000045_S0000188	THE PEOPLE WHO, WHEN THEY WALK INTO A BOOKSTORE, THEY HEAD STRAIGHT FOR THAT LITERARY FICTION SHELF, LIKE SERIOUS READING. KATIE, WHAT DO YOU HAVE FOR US?
POD1000000045_S0000195	AND SO WE START OFF MEETING ANNA. SHE IS KIND OF PUT INTO A PRECARIOUS SOCIAL SITUATION THAT MAKES HER KIND OF UNMARRIAGEABLE, BUT JESUS MARRIES HER.
POD1000000045_S0000200	WELL, SUMAT KID, OF COURSE, YOU KNOW, LIKE JUST SUCH A TREASURE.
POD1000000045_S0000213	THE MAIN CHARACTER IS ODIE AND HIS BROTHER, THEY ARE AT ONE OF THOSE NATIVE AMERICAN BOARDING SCHOOLS. THEY ARE NOT NATIVE AMERICANS. I DON'T REMEMBER HOW THEY ENDED UP THERE, BUT THEY ARE AT THIS SCHOOL.
POD1000000045_S0000214	THEY HAVE A GOOD FRIEND AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER LITTLE GIRL AND SOMETHING HAPPENS THAT MAKES THEM HAVE TO LEAVE THEIR SCHOOL. AND SO THEY ARE ON THIS JOURNEY TO SEARCH FOR ODIE AND HIS BROTHER'S AUNT WHO IS IN A DIFFERENT CITY.
POD1000000045_S0000227	THE FIRST ONE IS NAMED AMUNAH, AND SHE'S FROM MYANMAR, AND HER FAMILY CAME WITH HER TO AUSTIN. THAT WAS IN THE EARLY 2000S. AND THEN HASNA CAME FROM SYRIA WITH HER FAMILY,
POD1000000045_S0000254	OKAY, ANOTHER ONE THAT I LIKED THIS YEAR WAS CALLED THE HAPPY EVER AFTER PLAYLIST BY ABBY JIMENEZ. THIS ONE, IT'S LIKE A COMPANION NOVEL TO HER FIRST ONE, WHICH I DON'T REMEMBER THE TITLE NOW, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO READ THE FIRST ONE. SO YOU CAN PICK THIS ONE UP BY ITSELF.
POD1000000045_S0000255	SO SLOANE IS OUR MAIN CHARACTER. SHE'S AN ARTIST. HER LIFE IS KIND OF FALLING APART. AND THIS DOG LIKE JUMPS INTO HER CAR ONE DAY AND SHE HAS TO FIGURE OUT WHOSE DOG THIS IS AND WHAT'S GOING ON.
POD1000000045_S0000300	SO WE HAVE JANE MCKEAN IS OUR MAIN CHARACTER. SHE IS SNARKY AND SPICY AND STRONG. SHE'S JUST LIKE ONE OF THOSE CHARACTERS YOU WANT TO BE FRIENDS WITH BECAUSE SHE'S GREAT.
POD1000000045_S0000319	AND I THINK, CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, BUT I THINK KATIE COBB, AGAIN, ON CURRENTLY READING PODCAST HAS EVEN SAID THAT'S HOW SHE GETS THROUGH SO MANY BOOKS IS IF YOU LISTEN ON AUDIO AND IF YOU JUST, YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO CRANK IT UP LIKE CRAZY FAST. IF YOU JUST KNOCK THE SPEED UP JUST A LITTLE TINY BIT,
POD1000000045_S0000321	YEAH, SO GREAT. SO THOSE ARE KATIE. OH MY GOSH, WHAT A LIST YOU HAVE GIVEN US. THAT IS A HUGE GIFT JUST IN TIME FOR THE HOLIDAYS, YOU GUYS. KATIE IS GIVING US THIS GIFT.
POD1000000045_S0000407	AND THEN I DO HAVE A BLOG THAT I DON'T KEEP UP WITH TOO MUCH, BUT IT'S KATIEPROCTORWRITES.COM. AND SO SOMETIMES I DON'T WRITE ABOUT MIDDLE GRADE STUFF OVER THERE, WRITE ABOUT, YOU KNOW, CHRISTMAS AND FAMILIES AND ALL KINDS OF OTHER STUFF.

POD1000000046_S0000084	IT'S DIANE AND JAKE AND
POD1000000046_S0000087	WHAT I WAS GONNA DO IS I WAS GONNA BRING MY PHONE, PUT IT ON VOICE MEMO AND HAVE THE ENTIRE CONVERSATION WITH JAKE AND DIANE AND POSSIBLY AL, THE MANAGER.
POD1000000046_S0000126	I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU HAVE THIS MUCH TIME TO DO. I'LL JUST GO IN THERE AND END THIS TODAY FOR CHRIST'S SAKES. AND I'D LOVE TO DO IT. I'D BE HAPPY TO DO IT. JAMES.

POD1000000046_S0001151	SHE REALLY RUNS THAT SHOW. BUT JESSE AND I WERE CHATTING ABOUT IT. THE TWO BEST IN THE WORLD, IN MY OPINION, ARE CHAPPELLE AND BILL BURR, RIGHT? LIKE THAT'S ONE AND TWO IN THE WORLD.

YOU1000000001_S0000001	HEY GUYS, RANDY WITH PETE'S RV TV HERE TODAY. TODAY WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO LONE PINE CAMPGROUND IN MALLETS BAY, VERMONT.
YOU1000000001_S0000067	SO THANKS AGAIN FOR WATCHING PETE'S RV TV WITH RANDY TODAY.
YOU1000000005_S0000043	I'M GOING TO PUT THIS ON SO I CAN TRACK WHICHEVER PAGE THIS IS COMING FROM. SO I'M GOING TO SAY THIS IS COMING FROM ASK KORI PAGE.
YOU1000000007_S0000027	HEY JASON, I'M HERE TO ASSIST YOU WITH GETTING THE MOST ACCURATE VALUE OF YOUR HOME A COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS ARE YOUR REALTOR OR YOU'RE WORKING WITH A REALTOR? AND SO NOW WHAT WE DO IS WE JUST HIT NEXT
YOU1000000019_S0000002	THE CUBE WAS DESIGNED BY CHIII MOFANGI AND WAS APPROVED BY MATS VALK. OF COURSE THE CUBE IS HIS MAIN, BUT LET'S SEE HOW THE CUBE ACTUALLY PERFORMS AND WHETHER IT'S RIGHT FOR YOU.
YOU1000000021_S0000004	THE DMW IS A CONTINUOUSLY SPINNING SLOT MACHINE SYSTEM THAT CONFERS VARIOUS BONUSES, EFFECTS, AND ATTACKS BASED ON THE RESULTS, INCLUDING HOW ZACK LEVELS UP.
YOU1000000021_S0000007	THE GAME BEGINS WITH ZACH FAIR, SOLDIER 2ND CLASS OF THE GROUP CALLED SOLDIER, A PRIVATE MILITARY ARMY OWNED BY THE SHINRA ELECTRIC POWER COMPANY IN THE CITY OF MIDGAR.
YOU1000000021_S0000009	ZACK HAS TREMENDOUS SKILLS AND TALENT, BUT IS UNFORTUNATELY A LITTLE OVERCONFIDENT AND RECKLESS AT TIMES, AS POINTED OUT BY HIS FELLOW SOLDIER, ANOTHER FIRST CLASS NAMED SEPHIROTH.
YOU1000000021_S0000011	AND GIEL HELPS HIM OUT, REMINDING HIM TO TEMPER HIS ASPIRATIONS WITH PASSIONATE DREAMS AND STEADFAST HONOR.
YOU1000000021_S0000012	ZACK HEARS FROM A FELLOW SOLDIER OF THE MASS DESERTION OF TROOPS IN SOLDIER, AND HE'S SOON CALLED IN TO SPEAK WITH THE DIRECTOR OF SOLDIER, A MAN NAMED NELZARD.
YOU1000000021_S0000019	SUDDENLY, ANGEAL GOES MISSING, AND SEPHIROTH SUSPECTS HE TOO HAS BETRAYED THEM AND DESERTED, THOUGH ZACK FERVENTLY DENIES IT.
YOU1000000021_S0000020	AFTER THE MISSION, DR. LAZARD CONFIRMS ANGEO REALLY IS GONE FOR UNKNOWN REASONS, BUT ASSIGNS ZACK ON A NEW MISSION.
YOU1000000021_S0000027	FINDING ANGEAL'S MOTHER, JILLIAN, SHE NOTES ZACK IS THE RESTLESS PUPPY ANGEAL OFTEN SPOKE ABOUT, AND SHE TELLS HIM GENESIS CAME BY A MONTH AGO WITH AN ARMY OF MINIONS AND PROCEEDED TO START KILLING TOWNSHOPE.
YOU1000000021_S0000045	AS SEPHIROTH TALKS MORE WITH ZACK, HE ELABORATES MORE HOW ANGEAL, GENESIS AND HIMSELF WERE CLOSE FRIENDS, AND EVEN THOUGH SEPHIROTH HIMSELF WAS THE COMPANY'S PRIZED WAR HERO, GENESIS HIMSELF WANTED SUCH PRESTIGE AS WELL.
YOU1000000021_S0000048	SURVEYING THE MONSTER, SEPHIROTH INTRODUCES A DUO TO OUR LEAGUE WITH DR. HOLLANDER, WHICH TIES INTO THE STORY HE JUST TOLD.
YOU1000000021_S0000054	HOLLANDER HIMSELF APPEARS, SURPRISED TO SEE THEM, BUT EXPLAINS ONLY HE CAN STOP GENESIS' DEGRADATION. AFTER WHICH GENESIS HIMSELF APPEARS AND EXPLAINS HOLLANDER WON'T BE CAPTURED.
YOU1000000021_S0000063	SHE'S NATURALLY SURPRISED AND ACTUALLY LIKES HIS UNIQUE EYES, TO WHICH ZACK CONTINUES TO FLIRT, SHOWING OFF THE TRADEMARK MAKO INFUSED EYES OF A SOLDIER.
YOU1000000021_S0000069	LATER, ZACK GOES TO VISIT AERITH WHEN SONG HALTS HIM TO CALL HIM INTO A MISSION TO MODEOHHEIM AND GIVES ZACK PAUSE WHEN HE SAYS HE ALSO KNOWS AERITH BUT WON'T ELABORATE.
YOU1000000021_S0000072	ZACK IS FROM THE TINY VILLAGE OF GONGAGA, AND THIS VILLAGE IS FROM NIBELHEIM, WHO INTRODUCES HIMSELF AS CLOUD.
YOU1000000021_S0000073	AS THE MISSION FOR HOLLANDER CONTINUES, GENESIS MOVES TO KILL HIM, AS HE'S ALREADY BEGUN VISIBLY DEGRADING, AND CLAIMS HE DOESN'T NEED HOLLANDER ANYMORE.
YOU1000000021_S0000076	ON HIS WAY OUT, HE IS MET BY ANGEAL AS WELL AS HOLLANDER, WHO EXPLAINS THE G IN PROJECT G WAS NOT FOR GENESIS BUT FOR JILLIAN, WHO WAS ANGEAL'S MOTHER, WHO APPARENTLY TOOK HER OWN LIFE EARLIER THAN NORA.
YOU1000000021_S0000077	THE EXPERIMENT WAS TWOFOLD, JILLIAN HAD JENOVA'S CELLS INJECTED INTO HER WHILE SHE WAS PREGNANT WITH ANGEAL, AND GENESIS SIMPLY HAD JENOVA'S CELLS IMPLANTED DIRECTLY INTO HIM AS A TEST TUBE BABY.
YOU1000000021_S0000079	REASON BEING, ANGEAL CAN USE THE GENOVA CELLS AS A TWO WAY CONDUIT AS INTENDED. ANGEAL THEN EXPLAINS HIS CELLS CAN ABSORB GENETIC TRAITS AND PASS THEM TO OTHERS, BEYOND WHAT GENESIS CAN MANAGE WHICH IS ONLY IMPRINT THEM ONTO OTHERS.
YOU1000000021_S0000082	AFTER WINNING A BITTER VICTORY, A DEGRADING ANGEAL IS GRATEFUL THAT ZACK ENDED HIM WITH DIGNITY AND HONOR. BEFORE DYING, HE PASSES ON HIS FAMILY SWORD AND LEGACY OF HONOR, THE BUSTER SWORD, TO ZACK.
YOU1000000021_S0000088	SHE TEASES HIM ABOUT HIS GIRLFRIEND, AERITH, AND EXPLAINS SHE'S UNDER CONSTANT TURK SURVEILLANCE AS IT TURNS OUT SHE IS THE LAST LIVING MEMBER OF A RACE CALLED THE ANCIENT.
YOU1000000021_S0000089	ZACK IS SURPRISED NOT ONLY TO LEARN THIS, BUT ALSO THAT AERITH NEVER TOLD HIM.
YOU1000000021_S0000092	AND SO, ZACK'S VACATION IS OVER AS THE THREE OF THEM ARE TO INVESTIGATE AN ATTACK ON JUNON.
YOU1000000021_S0000093	IT TURNS OUT MORE GENESIS CLONES WERE ATTACKING, AND THIS TIME HOLLANDER WAS EVEN THERE, THOUGH HE GETS AWAY ONCE AGAIN.
YOU1000000021_S0000095	RETURNING TO AERITH, HE FINDS A MONSTER DOG THERE, BUT IT'S NOT REALLY CAUSING PROBLEMS, THOUGH ZACK NOTES IT'S ALSO AN ANGEL COPY, AND IT SEEMS KEEN TO PROTECT AERITH.
YOU1000000021_S0000101	AS THEIR MISSION MENTIONS NOTHING OF THEIR OLD FRIENDS, SEPHIROTH PRIVATELY CONFESSES TO ZACK THAT HE'S SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING LEAVING SHINRA AS WELL, DEPENDING ON WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS MISSION.
YOU1000000021_S0000105	AS THEY ARRIVE, SEPHIROTH MAKES SMALL TALK, ASKING CLOUD HOW IT FEELS TO BE HOME AGAIN, AND TRYING TO RELATE AS HE HAS NO ORIGINAL TOWN, AND ALL HE KNOWS IS HIS MOTHER'S NAME TO BE JENOVA, WHO DIED AFTER HE WAS BORN.
YOU1000000021_S0000106	IN TOWN, THEY ARE MET BY A LOCAL TOWN GIRL BY THE NAME OF TIFA,
YOU1000000021_S0000107	WHEN TIFA LEARNS HE'S A SOLDIER FIRST CLASS, SHE SEEMS SURPRISED BY THE FACT THAT THEY ONLY SENT HIM AND SEPHIROTH, AND BEGINS TO ASK SOMETHING ELSE, BUT STOPS AND RUNS OFF INSTEAD.
YOU1000000021_S0000117	SEPHIROTH COMES TO A HORRIFYING HYPOTHESIS THAT IT'S POSSIBLE HE WAS CREATED THE SAME WAY, AND IT BECOMES A CRISIS OF IDENTITY IRONICALLY IDENTICAL TO HIS FRIENDS GENESIS AND ANGEAL.
YOU1000000021_S0000128	AFTERWARDS, CLOUD WISHES HE WERE STRONG LIKE ZACK, BUT ZACK WARNS HIM NOT TO GET TANGLED UP WITH SOLDIER.
YOU1000000021_S0000132	IS SUDDENLY ON FIRE WITH MANY TOWNSFOLK SLAIN. EVEN CLOUD IS BEATEN ONCE AGAIN, AND AROUND THE CORNER IS SEPHIROTH HIMSELF, CALMLY STANDING AMIDST THE FLAMES.
YOU1000000021_S0000135	CONFRONTING SEPHIROTH, ZACK IS IGNORED AS SEPHIROTH INSISTS HIS MOTHER, THE ANCIENT, WAS THE SUPERIOR RACE AND THEY SHOULD HAVE RULED THE PLANET.
YOU1000000021_S0000137	FINALLY FED UP WITH THE CRIMES OF HUMANS, AND SHINRA IN PARTICULAR, SEPHIROTH SEES WHAT ANGEAL AND GENESIS KEPT WARNING ABOUT, AND CHOOSES TO STAND ALONE.
YOU1000000021_S0000152	CLOUD SUCCUMBS TO HIS INJURIES NEXT TO ZACK, AND AS THEY BOTH PASS OUT, DR. HOJO ARRIVES ON THE SCENE AND CHOOSES CLOUD TO BE HIS NEXT TEST SUBJECT.
YOU1000000021_S0000156	HOWEVER, SHINRA LABELS THEM BOTH FUGITIVE SAMPLES, SO THEY FIND THEMSELVES NOW RUNNING FROM THE ARMY, AND CISNE ACTUALLY MANAGES TO CATCH UP TO THEM FIRST.
YOU1000000021_S0000157	HE PLEADS WITH HER TO JUST WALK AWAY AS HE KNOWS IT'S A TALL ORDER TO ESCAPE THE TURKS, BUT SISNE CHOOSES HER DUTY OVER HER PERSONAL FEELINGS.
YOU1000000021_S0000161	HE KNOWS THERE ARE HOJO'S LATEST EXPERIMENTS AND MODIFIED VERSIONS OF JENOVA'S POWER RUNS THROUGH BOTH OF THEM.
YOU1000000021_S0000171	ALMOST TO MIDGAR, ZACK STOPS TO FINALLY CONFRONT THE FAILED AND TORTURED CREATION OF A JENOVA INFUSED HUMAN WHO CONSIDERS ZACK A PERFECT FUSION OF ANGEAL'S WILL AND SEPHIROTH'S SUPERIOR SELVES.
YOU1000000021_S0000185	MEANWHILE, SUNG ORDERS SISNE AND THE OTHER TURKS TO FIND AND SAVE ZACK BEFORE THE ARMY FINDS THEM, WHICH SISNE IS VERY MOTIVATED TO DO.
YOU1000000021_S0000186	THOUGH THIS IS THE NEAR TREASONOUS ACTION, SONG IS WILLING TO RISK IT FOR HIS FRIEND AND FOR AERITH'S SAKE.
YOU1000000021_S0000188	UNFORTUNATELY, THE ARMY INTERCEPTS ZACK FIRST, AND ZACK WILLINGLY CHOOSES TO FIGHT AND HONORABLY PROTECT CLOUD, DESPITE HIS OWN DESIRE TO RETURN TO AERITH AND SAVE HIMSELF.
YOU1000000021_S0000194	AGAINST ALL ODDS, ZACK TRIUMPHS IN HIS FINAL STAND, BUT HE IS ON HIS LAST LEGS AS SHINRA BEGINS REINFORCING THEIR TROOPS, FIRING COUNTLESS BULLETS INTO A RELENTLESS ZACK.
YOU1000000021_S0000199	MEANWHILE, CLOUD FINALLY WAKES UP AND DRAGS HIMSELF OVER TO ZACK, WHO IS STILL BARELY ALIVE, AND FORCES A SMILE FOR HIM AND URGES CLOUD TO LIVE ON IN HIS STEAD AS HIS OWN LIVING LEGACY.
YOU1000000021_S0000204	AS THE GAME ENDS, THE TRAUMA OF THE EVENTS UNFORTUNATELY RESULTED IN CLOUD BLOCKING ALL MEMORY OF ZACK, DESPITE HIS PROMISE.
YOU1000000027_S0000009	ALRIGHT, THE NEXT JOURNALING PROMPT IS SOMETHING THAT I LEARNED FROM MY FRIEND, KAJO PANDEY, THIS PAST SUNDAY, ACTUALLY. WE DID A LIVE CHAT TOGETHER ON FACEBOOK. IF YOU WANT TO WATCH THAT FULL LIVE CHAT, IT'S REALLY AMAZING.
YOU1000000033_S0000008	AND I HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE TODAY. JESUS SAYS TO EACH ONE OF US, I CAME THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE LIFE AND HAVE IT TO THE FULL. THE QUESTION IS, DO WE WANT IT?
YOU1000000033_S0000026	WHEN I WAS 20 YEARS OLD IN 1978, MY SISTER CONVINCED ME TO GO TO A CONFERENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME. AND I ALWAYS WANTED TO SEE NOTRE DAME, TOUCHDOWN JESUS, I THOUGHT I'LL GO.
YOU1000000033_S0000070	AND THEN I GOT INVOLVED IN THE CHARISMATIC RENEWAL MOVEMENT, AND THEN CARDINAL SOUNAZ ASKED ME TO MOVE TO BELGIUM. SO IT ISN'T LIKE I HAD A PLAN.
YOU1000000033_S0000084	WELL, I BEGAN WITH RENEWAL MINISTRIES BACK IN... ACTUALLY, I KNEW RALPH FOR QUITE A NUMBER OF YEARS, AND WE SPOKE AT SOME CONFERENCES TOGETHER AND CERTAINLY HAD SOMEWHAT OF A COMMON MIND.
YOU1000000033_S0000085	AND THEN PETER CAME INTO THE PICTURE AS WELL. AND THE THREE OF US, JUST AT DIFFERENT TIMES COLLABORATING AT A CONFERENCE SOMEWHERE, WE BEGAN TO SEE THAT WE ALL HAD A KIND OF SIMILAR MESSAGE.
YOU1000000033_S0000094	HOW IT ALL BEGAN, I DON'T KNOW IF RALPH MENTIONED THIS, BUT KIND OF HOW IT ALL BEGAN WAS HE AND I WENT TO HEAR A TALK IN DETROIT AT A LARGE CONFERENCE. WE CAME UP TO HEAR ONE SPEAKER AT THIS LARGER CONFERENCE.
YOU1000000033_S0000099	AND THEY STARTED PRAYING FOR US WITH RALPH AND I'M JUST KIND OF WATCHING. AND IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES WHERE I SAW THE GIFT OF PROPHECY, KIND OF, AND WORD OF KNOWLEDGE WORKING IN A VERY POWERFUL WAY.
YOU1000000033_S0000100	AND THEY STARTED SAYING THINGS ABOUT RALPH AND ABOUT HIS LIFE WHICH THEY COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN THAT WERE INDICATIONS OF HOW GOD HAD WORKED IN HIM AND WHAT THE LORD WANTED TO DO WITH HIM.
YOU1000000033_S0000105	AND SO AFTER IT WAS ALL DONE, WE WERE DRIVING HOME AND SAYING, WOW, WHAT'D YOU THINK OF THAT? YOU KNOW, AND RALPH SAID, JUST SAID, YOU KNOW, SCRIPTURE IS VERY CLEAR. IT SAYS TO NEVER DESPISE PROPHECY, BUT TEST EVERYTHING AND CLING TO WHAT IS GOOD.
YOU1000000033_S0000154	AND I WAS LIKE, LIKE TO? OF COURSE. SO WE WENT THERE AND AFTER MASS, WHEN HE CAME TO RALPH, WHO WAS NEXT TO ME,
YOU1000000033_S0000158	AND I KNEW HE DIDN'T WANT THE WHOLE 300 PAGE ANSWER, SO I SAID, HOLY FATHER, I THINK WHAT THE SPIRIT IS SAYING TO THE CHURCH IS JESUS. SO HE TOOK MY HAND AND HE SAID, JESUS, AND I SAID, JESUS.
YOU1000000033_S0000160	JOHN PAUL II IS OUR PATRON, THE CENTRAL PATRON MAYBE OF RENEWAL MINISTRIES. AND SO HE'S A GREAT INTERCESSOR FOR US. WE CONTINUE TO PRAY. WE ASK FOR HIS HELP. I FEEL HIS PRESENCE, ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M ON MISSION INTERNATIONALLY.
YOU1000000033_S0000169	AND MORE AND MORE WE'RE LIVING IN THE GROWTH OF AN INTERNATIONAL PAGAN CULTURE THAT'S BECOMING INCREASINGLY HOSTILE TO CHRIST AND THE CHURCH. WHERE IS THEIR LOYALTY?
YOU1000000033_S0000181	PETER, WHEN YOU'RE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT EVERY DAY AND YOU'RE GETTING UP EVERY DAY AND DOING WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO, SOMETIMES YOU DON'T GET THE WHOLE TRAJECTORY OF WHAT GOD'S DONE. IT'S JUST AMAZING TO SEE WHAT THE LORD'S DONE WITH US.
YOU1000000033_S0000208	JESUS IS THE LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS, AND WE WANT YOU TO HAVE THIS BOOKLET AT NO COST, JUST FOR THE ASKING, AND WE'LL BE BACK.
YOU1000000033_S0000211	IN THE WORDS OF POPE EMERITUS BENEDICT XVI, MAN IS PUSHING GOD FROM THE HUMAN HORIZON AND AS A RESULT, THE LIGHT WHICH COMES FROM GOD IS DISAPPEARING AND HUMANITY IS LOSING ITS BEARINGS.
YOU1000000033_S0000216	PETER, WE'VE SEEN HOW THE LORD HAS WORKED WITH US, BUT THE LORD WANTS TO WORK WITH EVERYBODY LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW?
YOU1000000037_S0000051	CODY'S SON. HELLO, Y'ALL.

YOU1000000039_S0000075	BUT THROUGH PATTERNING AND EXPERIENCE, I WAS FULLY CONFIDENT SHE'D TAKE THAT TOM DOWN.
YOU1000000039_S0000095	THIS TURKEY, OF COURSE, CAME OFF THE ROOST AND IT'S SO EMPTY. I'M FEELING RIGHT HERE. AND THERE'S NOTHING IN HIS CROP. WHEN I OPENED UP THE CROP IN THE TOM RAY HARVESTED, THERE WAS NOTHING IN IT.
YOU1000000039_S0000096	APPARENTLY, THAT OLD TOM CAME OFF THE ROOST AND STARTED WORKING RIGHT TOWARD OUR SETUP.
YOU1000000039_S0000100	PRO STAFFERS HEATH AND LINDSEY MARTIN ALSO HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A YOUTH HUNTING THIS PAST WEEKEND. THEY WENT ON A YOUTH HUNT SET UP BY SCOTT HOOK OF HOOK'S CUSTOM CALLS. THE HUNT WAS ORGANIZED IN NORTH CENTRAL ARKANSAS.

YOU1000000039_S0000133	THEY ENDED UP MOVING FURTHER INTO PROPERTY AND HAVING A GOBBLER RESPOND TO THEIR CALLS. THEY SCRAMBLED TO GET IT SET UP, BUT THIS TOM WORKED HIS WAY IN SILENTLY AND WOULDN'T GIVE CADE A GOOD SHOT.
YOU1000000039_S0000135	IT WAS A FUN DAY WITH SOME GOOD INTERACTIONS, BUT NEITHER GRACIE OR CADE TAGGED A TURKEY. BUT THEY WERE READY TO GO THE NEXT MORNING.
YOU1000000039_S0000147	BIRD DOWN. CONGRATULATIONS, GRACIE, ON YOUR FIRST TURKEY.
YOU1000000039_S0000178	DURING THE SAME WEEKEND, MATT TAGGED ALONG WITH SETH HARKER AND HIS SON, TRACE, DURING MISSOURI'S YOUTH SEASON.

YOU1000000045_S0000053	AND THEY WERE WOMEN WHO INSPIRED ME AS A LITTLE GIRL AND THEN THROUGHOUT MY LIFE, AND THE SAME WITH CHELSEA.
YOU1000000045_S0000075	HILLARY, I HAVE TO ASK YOU A QUESTION THAT HAS BEEN PLAGUING ME FOR A WHILE. HOW DID YOU KILL JEFFREY EPSTEIN?
YOU1000000045_S0000123	IT IS A STRANGE PERSPECTIVE TO HAVE, UM, BECAUSE I WAS A YOUNG LAWYER, UH, INVESTIGATING RICHARD NIXON.
YOU1000000045_S0000132	BECAUSE I WAS PART OF SEEING IT WORK, I BELIEVE, IN THE RIGHT WAY. ONE OF THE PEOPLE WE PROFILE IS BARBARA JORDAN,
YOU1000000045_S0000157	BUT THERE'S ALSO BEEN A LOT OF EFFORT TO FIND COMMON GROUND. SO BACK TO THE NIXON IMPEACHMENT,
YOU1000000045_S0000218	HE CLEARLY DOES PUTIN'S BIDDING. I MEAN, PUTIN COULD NOT BE HAPPIER TO HAVE THE UKRAINIANS CAUGHT UP IN THIS
YOU1000000101_S0000051	SENATOR FULBRIGHT HAS SAID AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY THAT THE CONSTITUTION IS OUTMODED.
YOU1000000101_S0000056	AND SENATOR CLARK OF PENNSYLVANIA, ANOTHER ARTICULATE SPOKESMAN, DEFINES LIBERALISM AS MEETING THE MATERIAL NEEDS OF THE MASSES THROUGH THE FULL POWER OF CENTRALIZED GOVERNMENT.
YOU1000000101_S0000140	AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS USED THAT TAX. THERE IS NO FUND. BECAUSE ROBERT BYERS, THE ACTUARIAL HEAD, APPEARED BEFORE A CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE
YOU1000000101_S0000183	LAST FEBRUARY 19TH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA, NORMAN THOMAS, SIX TIMES CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT ON THE SOCIALIST PARTY TICKET SAID, IF BARRY GOLDWATER BECAME PRESIDENT,

YOU1000000103_S0000030	BIDEN'S VACCINE GOAL, 100 MILLION SHOTS IN 100 DAYS.
YOU1000000103_S0000040	PRESIDENT BIDEN SOUNDED A LOT OF NOTES OF UNITY IN HIS INAUGURAL ADDRESS, BUT UNFORTUNATELY WHEN HE GOT BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE, HE IMPLEMENTED A BUNCH OF FAR LEFT POLICIES.
YOU1000000103_S0000041	TODAY, HOUSE SPEAKER PELOSI WAS PRESSED IF THE LOOMING IMPEACHMENT TRIAL OF FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP UNDERCUTS PRESIDENT BIDEN'S CALL FOR UNITY.

YOU1000000103_S0000132	I REALLY DON'T FEEL THAT THERE'S GROUNDS FOR IT. LET BIDEN GO AHEAD AND GO FORWARD. IMPEACHMENT'S NOT GOING TO ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING.

YOU1000000105_S0000000	ON SUNDAY, MILLIONS OF WOMEN AROUND THE WORLD BECAME FURIOUS WITH THEIR PARTNERS FOR NEVER LOOKING AT THEM THE WAY BRADLEY COOPER LOOKED AT OUR FIRST GUEST.
YOU1000000105_S0000025	BUT THEY WERE BACKSTAGE. BUT APPARENTLY OSCAR HAS SOME UNDIES.
YOU1000000105_S0000060	AND SO I WAS LIKE, YOU KNOW, WHAT DO YOU THINK, BRADLEY? AND HE GAVE ME, HE LAID IT ALL OUT. I MEAN, EVERYTHING THAT YOU SAW, THE WAY THAT IT WAS SHOT,
YOU1000000105_S0000066	LOOK, I'VE HAD MY ARMS WRAPPED AROUND TONY BENNETT FOR THREE YEARS TOURING THE WORLD.

YOU1000000109_S0000004	RONALDO.
YOU1000000109_S0000018	CRISTIANO NOW HAS THE CHANCE TO SCORE FOR HIS COUNTRY FROM THE PENALTY SPOT. HE'S BEEN HERE BEFORE.
YOU1000000109_S0000038	AND ROONEY AND ALL THE ENGLISH TEAM SAID THAT CRISTIANO GO TO THE REFEREE TO SAY GIVE HIM RED CARD.
YOU1000000109_S0000050	CRISTIANO RONALDO AGAINST DAVID DE GEA.
YOU1000000109_S0000053	PEPE GETS THE HEADER AND GOES DOWN. PLAY CONTINUES. IT'S DIEGO COSTA. CAN HE GET THE SHOT AWAY? COSTA SCORES!
YOU1000000109_S0000055	WELL, RONALDO'S MENTALITY, ISN'T IT? I THINK THAT'S WHAT MAKES HIM THE PLAYER HE IS.
YOU1000000109_S0000068	CARLOS QUEIROZ, THE COACH, HAD COME IN AND FORTUNATELY FOR PORTUGAL IT ALL WENT HORRIBLY WRONG. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RONALDO AND QUEIROZ WAS VERY STRAINED.
YOU1000000109_S0000095	IT SEEMS CRISTIANO CAN'T SHAKE HIS BAD LUCK AT THE WORLD CUP.
YOU1000000109_S0000106	YEDLIN WITH THE BALL IN, BRADLEY! CHANCE FOR USA! AND IT'S A GOAL!
YOU1000000109_S0000115	RONALDO MANAGED TO SCORE THE GOAL, BUT IT WAS ALREADY QUITE NEAR TOWARDS THE END OF THE GAME.
YOU1000000109_S0000122	RONALDO GOES DOWN, GETS A FREE KICK. CHALLENGES BY PIQUE. NOW THIS IS A KEY MOMENT. WE KNOW WHO'S GOING TO STRIKE IT.
YOU1000000109_S0000126	RONALDO.
YOU1000000109_S0000140	AGAINST IR IRAN, A QUARESMA WONDER GOAL PUTS PORTUGAL AHEAD.
YOU1000000109_S0000149	ROUND OF 16, THEY RUN INTO THE HAWAII, WHICH IS A TOUGH MATCHUP BECAUSE THEIR DEFENSE IS GEARED, IT'S VERY PHYSICAL, REALLY CAUSED PROBLEMS FOR CRISTIANO RONALDO.
YOU1000000109_S0000155	PEPE HAS DONE IT!
YOU1000000109_S0000168	RONALDO WILL NOT BE PORTUGAL'S SOLE ATTACKING THREAT. SO YOU COULD ARGUE THAT THE STAGE IS PERFECTLY SET FOR HIM TO REALLY THRIVE IN THIS WORLD CUP.
YOU1000000110_S0000052	IT'S MESSI, HE JUST HAD TO SCORE.
YOU1000000110_S0000062	LEO MESSI'S CAREER COULD HAVE BEEN VERY, VERY DIFFERENT HAD HE PLAYED AGAINST GERMANY.
YOU1000000110_S0000066	THE THIRD GROUP GAME WAS ON THE BACK OF MESSI. HE SCORED THE OPENING GOAL VERY EARLY ON.
YOU1000000110_S0000076	OPPOSITION, FLOUNDERLY INTENT ON TRYING TO STOP MESSI. HE WAS A MAN IN FORM AND A MAN INTENT ON TAKING ARGENTINA ALL THE WAY. SWITZERLAND, TOUGH OPPONENTS, NOT MUCH IN THE GAME.
YOU1000000110_S0000083	AGAINST BELGIUM, IT WOULD BE QUITE THE OPPOSITE, WITH MESSI CAPITALISING ON A MISTAKE IN THE FIRST FEW MINUTES.
YOU1000000110_S0000113	SAVED BY ROMERO!
YOU1000000110_S0000117	AND WHO HAVE ARGENTINA SENT UP FIRST? OF COURSE, LIONEL MESSI, THE MAN FOR ALL MOMENTS.
YOU1000000110_S0000127	IT ALL COMES DOWN TO MAXI RODRIGUEZ, A PLAYER FROM MESSI'S HOMETOWN.
YOU1000000110_S0000135	YOU HAD THE FEELING THAT THIS IS THEIR YEAR. THIS IS MESSI'S OPPORTUNITY.
YOU1000000110_S0000136	MESSI'S ARGENTINA WOULD FACE GERMANY ONCE AGAIN.
YOU1000000110_S0000141	THERE ARE THREE KEY MOMENTS I REMEMBER REALLY IN THAT FINAL FROM MESSI'S POINT OF VIEW. ONE WAS WHEN A MISTAKE BY GERMANY SENT GONZALO HIGUAIN CLEAN THROUGH ON GOAL.
YOU1000000110_S0000144	LITTLE MESSY!
YOU1000000110_S0000163	AND GERMANY GO ON AND WIN THE GAME AND MESSI'S ON THE LOSING SIDE.
YOU1000000110_S0000174	IN 2018, THERE WAS SO MUCH EXPECTATION ON MESSI. CAN HE TAKE THEM TO THE FINAL AND WIN IT THIS TIME?
YOU1000000110_S0000175	2018 FOR ME WAS THE REALISATION THAT MESSI CAN'T DO IT ALONE. MESSI NEEDS MORE QUALITY AROUND HIM.
YOU1000000110_S0000177	THERE WAS ONE OUTSTANDING MOMENT FOR MESSI IN THE TOURNAMENT. HIS GOAL AGAINST NIGEL. HE MADE A RUN OFF THE SHOULDER OF THE DEFENDER.
YOU1000000111_S0000005	THOMPSON SPINS, SHOOTS OVER IRVING. CAN'T GET IT TO FALL AND KEVIN LOVE, HIS 13TH REBOUND.
YOU1000000111_S0000009	NOW WE'RE GOING TO SEE J.R. SMITH PROBABLY SET THE SCREEN, GETTING CURRY IN THE ACTION.
YOU1000000111_S0000011	CURRY NOW PICKS HIM UP. FIVE TO SHOOT. JAMES POWERS DRIVES DOWN THE LANE. LAYUP. MISSED IT. IGUODALA CAN TEST IT.
YOU1000000111_S0000031	MEANWHILE, DRAYMOND GREEN, ONE ASSIST SHY OF A TRIPLE DOUBLE TO JOIN JAMES. IRVING WILL BRING IT UP.
YOU1000000111_S0000033	JAMES HOLDING, THROWS IT IN THE LEFT, GUARDED BY BARNES. LOVE A LITTLE JUMP, HOOK, SHORT, REBOUND GREEN. 14 REBOUNDS FOR DRAYMOND GREEN TO GO WITH 32 POINTS.
YOU1000000111_S0000038	THAT'S GREAT ROTATION BY THE CLEVELAND CAVALIERS. JAMES CLOSES TO THE OPPOSITE CORNER. LOVE PULLS THE TRIGGER ONTO GREEN.
YOU1000000111_S0000044	IGUODALA TO CURRY, BACK TO IGUODALA, UP FOR THE LAYUP, OH BLOCKED BY JAMES! LEBRON JAMES WITH THE REJECTION.
YOU1000000111_S0000054	JAMES INSIDE, LITTLE JUMP HOOK, THAT'S SHORT. REBOUND TIPPED AND TAKEN BY CURRY.
YOU1000000111_S0000073	AND MIKE TYLOO ELECTS TO TAKE OUT TRISTAN THOMPSON, INSERT RICHARD JEFFERSON. OFFENSIVELY, THAT'LL GIVE HIM MORE SPACE. BUT IF IT'S NOT A TIMEOUT, DEFENSIVELY,
YOU1000000111_S0000084	REBOUND JAMES WITH 30 SECONDS REMAINING.
YOU1000000111_S0000086	IRVING ON THE DRIVE, GOES INSIDE, LOST IT, GETS IT BACK AND FINDS LOVE. THERE'S A SEVEN SECOND DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SHOT CLOCK AND GAME CLOCK.
YOU1000000111_S0000088	BUT THAT'S A BAD FOUL, MIKE. THAT GIVES HIM THREE EXTRA SECONDS. AND WHAT WAS KYRIE IRVING DOING IN TRANSITION?
YOU1000000111_S0000094	IRVING DRIVES TO JAMES, MISSES THE JAM, BUT FOULED.
YOU1000000111_S0000101	WARRIORS WILL NO DOUBT PULL TIMEOUT. MISS OR MAKE HERE FROM JAMES.
YOU1000000111_S0000113	SHEPARD TRYING TO STAY WITH CURRY CATCHES ONE DRIBBLE STEPS BACK PUTS UP A THREE WON'T GO REBOUND TIP TAKEN BY SPADES FINAL SECONDS AND
YOU1000000111_S0000124	LET'S GO TO DORIS.
YOU1000000111_S0000125	MIKE, OVERCOME WITH EMOTION IS EXACTLY HOW I WOULD DESCRIBE LEBRON'S REACTION AS HE SHARES A HUG WITH KYRIE.
YOU1000000111_S0000128	I'M SORRY DORIS.
YOU1000000112_S0000005	FIRST DOWN PLAY IS GONNA BE RUNNING. PLAY WITH JONES, AND RONALD JONES! ANTONIO BROWN IS IN THIS GAME.
YOU1000000112_S0000035	BURNETT TRIED TO HURDLE, FELL BACK DOWN TO EARTH AND THEN TOOK OFF TO THE RIGHT.
YOU1000000112_S0000054	IT'S JONES. IT'S JONES GETTING HIT AND GETTING STOPPED. HE'S TO THE RIGHT SIDE, FOURTH AND GOAL.
YOU1000000112_S0000055	AS JONES, DID HE BREAK THE PLANE? STILL LOOKING, NO SIGNAL.
YOU1000000112_S0000083	NOW IT STOPS TO STOP AGAIN. BRADY PLAY ACTION.

YOU1000000112_S0000217	BUT WHAT A JOB TOM BRADY AND THIS BUCCANEERS TEAM IS DONE. LOOK AT THIS.
YOU1000000112_S0000219	ONE FOR A LONG BALL OVER THE HEAD OF BROWN. ONLY GOT ONE OUT OF ARIZONA. ALL HE DID WAS WIN A COUPLE OF COACHES' COACH OF THE YEAR AWARDS.

YOU1000000128_S0000030	THAT'S WHEN IRANIAN GENERAL SOLEIMANI WAS ASSASSINATED IN IRAQ.
YOU1000000129_S0000008	CARNEGIE WAS AT ONE POINT THE RICHEST AMERICAN IN HISTORY, BUT HE WASN'T BORN IN AMERICA.
YOU1000000129_S0000009	ANDREW'S STORY BEGINS ACROSS THE ATLANTIC OCEAN IN DUNFERMLINE, SCOTLAND, WHERE HE GREW UP IN WHAT COULD ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS ABJECT POVERTY.
YOU1000000129_S0000022	CARNEGIE WOULD PROFIT FROM IT. HE WAS ABLE TO ESCAPE HARM'S WAY AFTER PAYING $850 FOR A SUBSTITUTE TO TAKE HIS PLACE ON THE BATTLEFIELD. IT WAS DURING THIS TIME THAT CARNEGIE NOTICED THAT THE WOODEN BRIDGES WERE EASILY BURNT BY THE TROOPS.
YOU1000000129_S0000025	OWNING THE IRON SOURCE MEANT THAT CARNEGIE'S BRIDGE BUILDING COMPANY WOULD NOT BE DEPENDENT ON MINING OR EXTRACTING COMPANIES FOR IRON, LIKE THEIR COMPETITORS. THIS NOT ONLY GAVE CARNEGIE MORE CONTROL OVER THE ENTIRE PROCESS, IT ALSO IMPROVED THEIR MARGINS.
YOU1000000129_S0000044	HENRY CLAY FRICK. AS A TEAM, CARNEGIE AND FRICK WERE A POWERFUL FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH. AND TO SHOW HOW RUTHLESS THE TWO COULD BE, LOOK NO FARTHER THAN THE STORY ABOUT DUQUESNE WORKS.
YOU1000000129_S0000059	IN 1898, 9% OF ALL STEELWORKERS, INDUSTRY WIDE, WOULD DIE ON THE JOB. WHEN THE WORKERS REFUSED FRICK'S AGGRESSIVE DEMANDS FOR LONGER HOURS AND LESS PAY, HE DECIDED TO LOCK OUT ALL EMPLOYEES.
YOU1000000129_S0000076	AS THE STORY GOES, J.P. MORGAN GLANCED AT THE OFFER AND WITHOUT HESITATION ACCEPTED IT. MORGAN WOULD BUY CARNEGIE STEEL FOR $480 MILLION, MAKING CARNEGIE THE SINGLE RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD AT THE TIME.
YOU1000000129_S0000077	CARNEGIE WOULD COMPLETELY CUT TIES WITH HIS BUSINESS LIFE AND DEDICATE 100% OF HIMSELF TO SERVING THE WORLD THROUGH PHILANTHROPY. NOT A SINGLE DOLLAR WOULD BE LEFT TO HIS FAMILY.
YOU1000000129_S0000078	BECAUSE ANDREW HAD ONLY 5 YEARS OF SCHOOLING, HE HAD A SOFT SPOT FOR LIBRARIES, WHICH HE CREDITS FOR HELPING HIM ACHIEVE THE FINANCIAL SUCCESS HE ACQUIRED.
YOU1000000129_S0000080	ONE EXAMPLE OF HIS GENEROSITY IS CARNEGIE HALL, ONE OF NEW YORK'S MOST RECOGNIZABLE LANDMARKS. BUILT IN 1891, CARNEGIE BUILT AND DONATED THE BUILDING AS THE MUSIC HALL.
YOU1000000129_S0000085	PERHAPS HE VIEWED DONATING HIS MONEY AS A WAY TO ATONE FOR HIS BUSINESS SINS. MAKING MONEY IS A GREAT FEELING, BUT AN EVEN BETTER FEELING IS GIVING IT AWAY. IF YOU WANT TO GROW WEALTH AND PERHAPS DONATE TO NOBLE CAUSES LIKE CARNEGIE DID,
YOU1000000130_S0000011	BY THE TIME HENRY HAD BECOME A TEENAGER, THE STEAM ENGINE WAS ALREADY MAKING ITS WAY INTO THE FARMING COMMUNITY. COAL POWERED THRESHING MACHINES AND SAWMILLS WERE BECOMING COMMON SIGHT AND HENRY WAS LEARNING HOW THEY WORKED AND HOW TO FIX THEM.
YOU1000000130_S0000017	IT IS DURING THIS TIME THAT HENRY BY CHANCE LEARNED ABOUT THE GAS ENGINE FROM A BRITISH MAGAZINE. IT WAS BEING PRODUCED IN SMALL NUMBERS BY A GERMAN ENGINEER, NICHOLAS OTTO,
YOU1000000130_S0000018	AND IT WAS GAINING SOME TRACTION IN EUROPE, BUT IT WAS PRACTICALLY UNHEARD OF IN AMERICA. HENRY WOULD GET THE CHANCE TO WORK ON SUCH AN ENGINE HIMSELF IN 1889, AND HE INSTANTLY RECOGNIZED THE ADVANTAGES IT HAD.
YOU1000000130_S0000020	THIS ALSO ALLOWED THE GAS ENGINE TO START QUICKLY, WHEREAS STEAM ENGINES OF THE TIME NEEDED AS MUCH AS 30 MINUTES TO HEAT UP THE WATER AND GENERATE ENOUGH STEAM TO START WORKING. THE GAS ENGINE WAS AN INNOVATION HENRY FELL IN LOVE WITH.
YOU1000000130_S0000023	IT WAS GENERATING ELECTRICITY FOR OVER A THOUSAND HOMES IN DETROIT, AND IT WAS DOING SO BY USING STEAM ENGINES, SO HENRY WAS A NATURAL HIRE FOR THEM. WHENEVER THE ENGINES BROKE, HENRY HAD TO FIX THEM, BUT WHENEVER THEY WERE WORKING,
YOU1000000130_S0000029	HE HAD DRIVEN A THOUSAND MILES IN IT. HENRY BUILT A SECOND QUADRICYCLE AND THEN A THIRD ONE, ALWAYS IMPROVING THE DESIGN, BEFORE FINALLY FEELING CONFIDENT ENOUGH IN 1899 TO START HIS OWN COMPANY.
YOU1000000130_S0000032	AND EVERYONE WAS EAGER TO SEE WHAT HENRY COULD CREATE WITH PROPER CAPITAL. HENRY'S PLAN WAS VERY CLEVER. SINCE HE PERSONALLY KNEW MANY OF THE INDUSTRIALISTS IN DETROIT BY THAT POINT, HE'D TRY TO BUILD AN AUTOMOBILE THEY COULD USE IN THEIR BUSINESSES.
YOU1000000130_S0000033	HE LEASED A FACTORY AND PLANNED TO HIRE A HUNDRED WORKERS TO MAKE HIS NEW DELIVERY WAGON, AS HE CALLED IT. BUT IT TURNED OUT THAT BUILDING SUCH COMPLEX MACHINES IN HIGH NUMBERS WAS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT THAN HENRY IMAGINED.
YOU1000000130_S0000041	HENRY LABELLED HIS FIRST DESIGN AS THE MODEL A AND WORKED HIS WAY THROUGH THE ALPHABET OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS, SUSTAINED BY CAPITAL FROM HIS FRIENDS AND FAMILY.
YOU1000000130_S0000044	THE BIGGEST GAME CHANGER OF ALL, HOWEVER, WAS HENRY CHAN'S VISIT TO A SLAUGHTERHOUSE IN CHICAGO. HE SAW THERE SOMETHING INTERESTING, A DISASSEMBLY LINE, SO TO SPEAK, WHERE MULTIPLE WORKERS WOULD PROCESS CARCASSES MOVING DOWN A LINE.
YOU1000000130_S0000049	IT IS ACTUALLY DURING THE PRODUCTION OF THIS MODEL THAT HENRY WOULD FIRST USE THE ASSEMBLY LINE PROCESS TO AT LEAST PARTIALLY ASSEMBLE SOME OF HIS CARS.
YOU1000000130_S0000060	THEY WOULD HELP HIM TRANSITION HIS ENTIRE MANUFACTURING PROCESS TO USE VANADIUM STEEL. IT WAS THEIR CHIEF ENGINEER THAT BUILT THE HEAT TREATMENT PLANT FOR HENRY IN 1907,
YOU1000000130_S0000068	HENRY HAD BEGUN A NEW AGE IN AMERICAN HISTORY, THE AGE OF THE AUTOMOBILE, AND IT WAS HIS COMPANY THAT WOULD TOTALLY DOMINATE IT IN ITS FIRST TWO DECADES.
YOU1000000130_S0000069	IT WASN'T UNTIL THE END OF THE 1920S THAT THE REST OF THE AUTO INDUSTRY CAUGHT UP TO HENRY, BUT AT THAT POINT HE WAS ALREADY ONE OF THE RICHEST MEN ALIVE.
YOU1000000131_S0000005	THE ORIGINS OF HISTORY'S GREATEST OIL MONOPOLY ARE ACTUALLY PRETTY HUMBLE. IT ALL STARTS IN 1839 WITH THE BIRTH OF JOHN ROCKEFELLER IN UPSTATE NEW YORK. HE WAS THE ELDEST SON OF A TRAVELING MERCHANT.
YOU1000000131_S0000008	SO THEY COULD ALL LIVE TOGETHER. IN THIS VERY CONFUSING HOUSEHOLD, JOHN WOULD GROW UP LEARNING HOW TO HUSTLE PEOPLE FOR THE BEST DEAL POSSIBLE AND HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF EVERY PENNY HE GOT. HIS FAMILY WOULD RARELY STAY IN ONE PLACE FOR LONG,
YOU1000000131_S0000009	AND JOHN WOULD LIVE THIS NOMADIC LIFESTYLE EVER SINCE HE WAS THREE YEARS OLD. TO HELP HIS MOTHER, JOHN WOULD EARN ANY MONEY HE COULD BY RAISING TURKEYS OR DOING WORK FOR NEIGHBORS. HIS INTELLIGENCE WAS PUT TO GOOD USE
YOU1000000131_S0000012	THANKS TO HIS GOOD REPUTATION, HE GOT A LOAN OF $4,000, WHICH AT THE TIME WAS A HUGE SUM. JOHN STARTED TRADING HAY, GRAIN, AND VARIOUS MEATS, AND IN HIS FIRST YEAR HE RECORDED SALES OF HALF A MILLION DOLLARS.
YOU1000000131_S0000019	FOR THE BYPRODUCTS OF REFINING PETROLEUM. YOU SEE, THE EARLY REFINERIES IN CLEVELAND COULD ONLY OPERATE AT ABOUT A 60% EFFICIENCY, BUT JOHN NOT ONLY INCREASED THAT PERCENTAGE, HE ALSO STARTED SELLING ALL THE BYPRODUCTS, LIKE PARAFFIN WAX
YOU1000000131_S0000025	OF COURSE, NOT EVERYONE WOULD GIVE UP IMMEDIATELY, AND OVER TIME, JOHN ERODED THE PRICE OF OIL AND KEROSENE, SOMETIMES BY AS MUCH AS 80%, IN ORDER TO STRANGLE COMPETITORS. UNSURPRISINGLY, HIS STRATEGY WORKED.
YOU1000000131_S0000033	THEN, TO SHOWCASE HIS SUCCESS, JOHN BUILT AN IMPRESSIVE HEADQUARTERS FOR HIS COMPANY ON BROADWAY. THIS MOMENT WAS THE HIGH POINT OF ROCKEFELLER STANDARD OIL.
YOU1000000131_S0000040	AND BROKE THE COMPANY UP INTO 34 SEPARATE ENTITIES. OF COURSE, JOHN ROCKEFELLER KEPT HIS STAKE IN THOSE COMPANIES UNTIL HIS DEATH, AND IN FACT IT TURNS OUT THAT THE BREAKUP WAS THE MOST PROFITABLE EVENT IN HIS LIFE.
YOU1000000132_S0000012	AND ROTHSCHILDS WERE NO EXCEPTION. THEY SPECIALIZED IN EXCHANGING CURRENCIES AND TRADING COLLECTIBLE COINS, AND THE BEST ONE OF THEM ALL WAS MEYER ROTHSCHILD. HE TOOK UP THE FAMILY BUSINESS IN 1763 AND HIS EXTENSIVE COLLECTION OF COINS
YOU1000000132_S0000020	DESPITE THE DISTANCE, THE BROTHERS APPLIED A UNIFIED STRATEGY. THEY WOULD LOAN OUT THEIR MONEY TO THE ARISTOCRACY AND TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THE BROTHER IN FRANCE, FOR EXAMPLE, BECAME THE BANKER OF LEOPOLD I OF BELGIUM.
YOU1000000132_S0000030	THERE, THE TWO ROTHSCHILD HEIRS HAD 11 GIRLS AND NOT A SINGLE BOY, SPLITTING UP THE FORTUNE AND DISINTEGRATING ITS POWER. THE ROTHSCHILD BRANCH IN AUSTRIA WAS DOING WELL, UNTIL HITLER CAME TO POWER, OF COURSE.
YOU1000000132_S0000036	ITS PATRIARCH DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE 20TH CENTURY WAS SIR EVELYN ROTHSCHILD, WHO EVEN TODAY IS THE FINANCIAL ADVISOR TO QUEEN ELIZABETH. HE RETIRED FROM LEADERSHIP IN 2003, PASSING THE MANTLE OF PATRIARCH TO DAVID ROTHSCHILD.
YOU1000000133_S0000009	LIFE SEEMED GREAT, BUT IN 1997 HE SUFFERED AN INCONVENIENCE THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY BECOME A WORLD CHANGER. HASTINGS HAD FORGOTTEN TO RETURN HIS VIDEO RENTAL OF APOLLO 13 AND AS A RESULT WAS SLAPPED WITH A $40 LATE FEE.
YOU1000000133_S0000038	BLOCKBUSTER AND WALMART, HOWEVER, WERE A BIT LATE TO THE PARTY. HASTINGS ADMITTED THAT, IF THEY HAD STARTED TWO YEARS EARLIER, THEY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE WON. ON AN END OF YEAR CONFERENCE CALL, HASTINGS DECLARED, BLOCKBUSTER HAS THROWN EVERYTHING BUT THE KITCHEN SINK AT US.
YOU1000000134_S0000006	IN AN INDUSTRY WHERE INNOVATION IS JUST PART OF THE JOB DESCRIPTION, LARRY PAGE AND SERGEY BRIN HAVE BECOME VIRTUAL MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE OF INFORMATION GATHERING.
YOU1000000134_S0000038	STANFORD PROFESSOR AND ENGINEERING CONSULTANT TO GOOGLE, TERRY WINOGRAD.
YOU1000000134_S0000046	PAGE AND BRIN PUSHED FOR SOMETHING BETTER.
YOU1000000134_S0000093	THEY WENT BACK TO RAM SARAM.
YOU1000000134_S0000099	THEY ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF TWO WELL KNOWN SILICON VALLEY VENTURE CAPITALISTS, MICHAEL MORITZ OF SEQUOIA CAPITAL AND JOHN DOERR OF KLEINER PERKINS.
YOU1000000134_S0000100	BOTH WANTED AN EXCLUSIVE DEAL. BRENNAN PAGE SAID NO DEAL.
YOU1000000134_S0000106	CHRIS SACCA IS A FORMER GOOGLER.
YOU1000000134_S0000120	PAIGE AND BRYNN HAD TO ACCEPT ADVERTISING AS THEIR ONLY OPTION.
YOU1000000134_S0000132	DAVID THACKER WAS A PROJECT MANAGER ON ADWORDS.
YOU1000000134_S0000149	AND HE SAYS, I CAN DO BOTH. BARRY DALY SAYS, NO, YOU CAN'T DO BOTH. CHOOSE. HE SAYS, I CHOOSE THIS.
YOU1000000134_S0000152	THE VENTURE CAPITALISTS BEHIND THE COMPANY, MICHAEL MORITZ AND JOHN DOERR, WERE PRESSURING ITS CO FOUNDERS TO HIRE A CEO.
YOU1000000134_S0000157	JOHN DOERR INTRODUCED PAGE AND BRIN TO ERIC SCHMIDT, A BUSINESSMAN WITH AN ENGINEERING BACKGROUND.
YOU1000000134_S0000201	FOR BRYN, SON OF RUSSIAN IMMIGRANTS, IT WAS A TROUBLING DECISION.
YOU1000000134_S0000236	THEIR LONG TIME IDOL, STEVE JOBS, SLAMMED GOOGLE FOR ENTERING THE PHONE BUSINESS AND ACCUSED THEM OF TRYING TO KILL THE IPHONE.
YOU1000000134_S0000273	THE COMPANY KNOWN FOR SEARCH WAS STRUGGLING TO DIVERSIFY AND WAS FACING AN AGGRESSIVE NEW CHALLENGER, MARK ZUCKERBERG.
YOU1000000134_S0000280	IN JANUARY 2011, IN A STARTLING SILICON VALLEY SHAKEUP, ERIC SCHMIDT ANNOUNCED THAT GOOGLE WAS SIMPLIFYING ITS MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE.
YOU1000000134_S0000291	BRYN MARRIED BIOTECH SPECIALIST ANN WOJCICKI IN THE BAHAMAS WITH HIS PARTNER LARRY PAGE STANDING UP FOR HIM. THEY BOTH HAVE TWO CHILDREN.
YOU1000000135_S0000008	IN THE EARLY 2000S, ELON MUSK ACHIEVED WHAT ANY ENTREPRENEUR WOULD DREAM OF ACHIEVING. HE SUCCESSFULLY SOLD HIS COMPANY FOR OVER A BILLION DOLLARS.
YOU1000000135_S0000024	AT FIRST, PEOPLE THOUGHT ELON WAS MAKING PRANKS, BUT WITHIN A YEAR HE HAD ASSEMBLED SOME OF THE BRIGHTEST ENGINEERS IN AMERICA.
YOU1000000135_S0000041	BUT, LIKE WITH THE FALCON 1, THE ACTUAL PRODUCTION WASN'T GOING VERY WELL. TESLA'S CEO AT THE TIME WAS MARTIN EBERHARD.
YOU1000000135_S0000047	AT TESLA, ELON STRUGGLED FIXING THE MESS LEFT BEHIND BY EBERHARD. AND IN FACT, THE ROADSTER'S PRODUCTION WOULD NOT BEGIN UNTIL MARCH 2008.
YOU1000000136_S0000083	THIS, THE BIGGEST ARCTIC CONVOY LOSS OF THE WAR, PROVOKED A FURIOUS RESPONSE FROM WINSTON CHURCHILL.
YOU1000000136_S0000134	HE'S EXPLORING THE DAILY ROUTINE ON BOARD WITH CURATOR LEIF ARNEBERG.
YOU1000000136_S0000289	JUST BEFORE 8.30 A.M., THE LANCASTERS BEGAN THEIR APPROACH TO THE TIRPITZ. RAF CAMERAS WERE AGAIN ON HAND TO FILM IT ALL. SO FAR, THERE WAS STILL NO SIGN OF KURT AND HIS FIGHTERS.
YOU1000000136_S0000315	YEAH, YOU COULD SEE IT GO DOWN LIKE A DART ALMOST, BECAUSE IT WAS PAINTED BRIGHT GREEN. YEAH. AND IT LOOKED QUITE NICE, ACTUALLY, DIVING DOWN THERE.
YOU1000000136_S0000319	AFTER THE FIRST WAVE OF SIX BOMBERS, TONY IVERSON WAS IN THE SECOND WAVE OF THREE. HE ATTACKED AT 8.42.
YOU1000000136_S0000361	WILLIBALD WELSING WAS BELOW DECKS WHEN THE SHIP CAPSIZED.
YOU1000000136_S0000363	21 YEAR OLD KARL HEINZ KERSLING WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE ON SHORE AT THE TIME OF THE ATTACK.
YOU1000000136_S0000377	ON THE ISLAND OF VANDOIA, PATRICK IS FOLLOWING A NEW LEAD THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN WHY THE GERMAN FIGHTERS WEREN'T SCRAMBLED IN TIME.
YOU1000000136_S0000381	VESNA WAS A KEY LINK IN THE RADAR COMMUNICATION NETWORK ON THE ISLAND. PETTERSSON THINKS VESNA COULD HAVE DELAYED VITAL INFORMATION TO THE FIGHTER SQUADRON AT BARDUFOSS.
YOU1000000136_S0000391	VESNA WAS IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME, BUT WAS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR DELAYING VITAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE RAID?
YOU1000000136_S0000392	I THINK WESSNER HAS A FINGER TO STOP SENDING UP A GERMANY PLANE TO TAKE THE LANCASTER.
YOU1000000136_S0000421	GOOD MORNING, TONY.
YOU1000000137_S0000013	EUROPE WAS TRANSFORMED UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF INDIVIDUALS LIKE MICHELANGELO BINAROTTI, MEN OF EXTRAORDINARY ACCOMPLISHMENT AND VERSATILITY WHO FOUND WAYS TO BRING SEEMINGLY IMPOSSIBLE IDEAS TO LIFE.
YOU1000000137_S0000041	POPE INNOCENT III SAID AT THE END OF THE 12TH CENTURY THAT MAN WAS ROTTENNESS, FORMED OF SLIME AND ASHES, A CONTEMPTIBLE CREATURE. THE MEDIEVAL BELIEF THAT THE SINFUL NATURE OF MAN WAS VISIBLE IN HIS APPEARANCE.
YOU1000000137_S0000054	MEN LIKE MICHELANGELO CREATED SOMETHING NEW. THEY TOOK THE TECHNIQUES AND ART OF THE ANCIENT GREEKS AND ROMANS AND DEVELOPED THEM FURTHER.
YOU1000000137_S0000125	THE BYZANTINE EMPERORS SAW THEMSELVES AS DESCENDANTS OF CAESAR AND AUGUSTUS, WHILE ITS PATRIARCH WAS HEAD OF THE ORTHODOX CHRISTIANS.
YOU1000000137_S0000160	THE SCHOLAR MANUEL CHRYSOLORAS WAS ONE OF THEM. WHEN THE CHANCELLOR OF FLORENCE OFFERED HIM A CHAIR AT THE UNIVERSITY THERE, HE ALSO SENT HIM A WISH LIST OF ANCIENT WORKS.
YOU1000000137_S0000194	NO ONE IN THE MIDDLE AGES HAD THE KNOWLEDGE TO SOLVE THE STRUCTURAL AND TECHNICAL PROBLEMS. FILIPPO BRUNELLESCHI TOOK ON THE TASK.
YOU1000000137_S0000196	BRUNELLESCHI WAS AN ARCHITECT AND SCULPTOR, AS WELL AS AN ENGINEER AND AN INVENTOR.
YOU1000000137_S0000266	OTHERS WOULD HAVE WANTED TO SQUARE THEIR ACCOUNTS WITH GOD AND DO SOMETHING FOR THE WELL BEING OF THEIR SOULS, LIKE COSIMO DE' MEDICI, WHO BUILT AN ENTIRE CHURCH.
YOU1000000137_S0000281	LET'S GO BACK TO THE YEAR 1425 AND THE SCULPTOR DONATELLO.
YOU1000000137_S0000283	HIS PATRON, COSIMO MEDICI, WAS THE FIRST GREAT SPONSOR OF THE ARTS.
YOU1000000137_S0000284	MEDICI WAS A WEALTHY BANKER AND A SHREWD STRATEGIST WHO EMPLOYED ALMOST MAFIA LIKE METHODS.
YOU1000000137_S0000306	THE MEDICI PALACE IS A GLORIOUS STAGE OF RENAISSANCE ART. IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT COSIMO INSTRUCTED THE ARCHITECT NOT TO MAKE IT TOO MAGNIFICENT, AS HE DIDN'T WANT TO ROUSE THE ENVY OF THE OTHER PATRICIAN FAMILIES.
YOU1000000137_S0000324	HE WAS ALMOST 60 WHEN HE CAME TO COSIMO DE' MEDICI WITH DESIGNS FOR HIS STATUE OF DAVID, THE BOY WHO DEFEATED GOLIATH.
YOU1000000137_S0000331	DONATELLO'S DAVID WAS THE FIRST LIFE SIZED SCULPTURE OF A NUDE SINCE ANTIQUITY.
YOU1000000137_S0000347	AND HE IS FASCINATINGLY LIFELIKE. BUT WHERE DID DONATELLO GET HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE HUMAN BODY?
YOU1000000137_S0000355	DO NUTELLO QUITE POSSIBLY DISSECTED CORPSES TOO? AS DID ALBRECHT DÜRER, MICHELANGELO AND LEONARDO DA VINCI ONE OR TWO GENERATIONS LATER.
YOU1000000137_S0000365	HALF A CENTURY AFTER DONATELLO, IT SYMBOLIZED THE SELF CONFIDENCE OF THE NEW RENAISSANCE MAN.
YOU1000000139_S0000001	I'M YARIK ASPOROV AND I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF MY MOST MEMORABLE MOMENTS AT THE CHESSBOARD.
YOU1000000139_S0000005	12 TO 11 BEFORE THE LAST GAME. AND AS A WORLD CHAMPION, I HAD MY LAST CHANCE TO RETAIN THE TITLE BY BEATING KARPOV IN THIS GAME 24, CRUCIAL GAME 24. I WAS NOT RUSHING FROM THE BEGINNING. I TRIED TO PLAY VERY QUIET POSITIONAL GAME.
YOU1000000139_S0000011	NEXT DAY, WHEN I SHOWED UP AT THE STAGE, I WAS A COUPLE OF MINUTES EARLIER. I HAVE TO SAY THAT WITH MY COACHES, WE HAVE BEEN ANALYZING THIS, BUT WE COULDN'T FIND ANY DECISIVE IDEAS. AND THEN I SAW KARPOV ENTERING THE STAGE.
YOU1000000139_S0000030	I THINK THAT MOST LIKELY ANAND WOULD HAVE RESIGNED IF I JUST TAKE WITH THE KNIGHT ON E3. BUT SUDDENLY I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, WHY I TOOK WITH THE KNIGHT IF I DO THE SAME BY EXCHANGING QUEENS BY TAKING WITH QUEEN.
YOU1000000139_S0000036	AND IT COST ME THE VICTORY OF THE FINAL, BUT ALSO IT'S KIND OF A MEMORY SCORE. SO IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT IS JUST SITTING THERE.
YOU1000000139_S0000057	THIS IS ARGUABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT GAME IN MY LIFE. GAME 24 AGAINST ANATOLY KARPOV IN OUR SECOND MATCH IN 1985.
YOU1000000139_S0000072	AND I REMEMBER THAT WHEN I PLAYED ROOKIE SEVEN AND KARPOV CAME BACK TO THE CHESSBOARD FROM HIS GREEN ROOM, INSTANTLY YOU COULD FEEL THAT HE SENSED THAT SOMETHING HAS CHANGED. HE DIDN'T LIKE IT, SO I ACTUALLY BEGAN TO GAIN EVEN MORE CONFIDENCE.
YOU1000000139_S0000076	AND THE KARPOV MADE A QUIET MOVE, KG1, I PUT ANOTHER ROOK HERE, WHICH IS TOTALLY ODD BECAUSE BOTH ROOKS ARE JUST STANDING BEHIND THE PAWN ON E6, BUT I'M JUST FIGHTING AGAINST F5, AND THEN KD1, I EVEN PLAY F5,
YOU1000000139_S0000077	AND KARPOV TOOK ON PASSAN, I TOOK ON F6, AND THEN EVENTUALLY I SACRIFICED THE PAWN
YOU1000000142_S0000061	I WALKED IN THE HOUSE, MY DAD GOES, RUSSELL, COME AND DO THE DISHES. FUCK YOU, DAD!
YOU1000000142_S0000067	THAT WAS MY DAD'S THREAT RIGHT BEFORE HE BEAT ME EVERY SINGLE TIME.
YOU1000000142_S0000079	I'M IN THE BACK PRAYING, I HOPE IT'S MY BROTHER, MAN. PLEASE BEAT JULIO'S ASS.
YOU1000000143_S0000001	GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE. MY NAME IS KIO WONG. BUT TO MOST PEOPLE, I AM KNOWN AS WHO?
YOU1000000143_S0000039	AND HE WOULD SAY TO ME, HEY, DAD, WHY DO I HAVE TO LEARN TWO LANGUAGES? I SAID, SON, ONCE YOU BECOME THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SIGN LEGISLATIVE BILLS IN ENGLISH.
YOU1000000143_S0000044	AND IN ORDER FOR ME TO BECOME A US CITIZEN, I HAD TO TAKE THESE AMERICAN HISTORY LESSONS WHERE THEY ASK US QUESTIONS LIKE, WHO'S BENJAMIN FRANKLIN? WE'RE LIKE, OH.
YOU1000000143_S0000052	WHAT IS ROE VERSUS WADE? WE'RE LIKE, OH, TWO WAYS OF COMING TO THE UNITED STATES.
YOU1000000143_S0000070	I'M HONORED TO MEET VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN HERE TONIGHT. I ACTUALLY READ YOUR AUTOBIOGRAPHY. AND TODAY I SEE YOU.
YOU1000000144_S0000028	LEXI'S LUCKY TO GET AWAY, 14 HP.
YOU1000000144_S0000029	ARIEL IS GONE. GOT ONE WITH AN AID THOUGH, S1MPLE. MAY HAVE TAKEN HIM DOWN, BUT HE FOUND EDWARD INSTEAD. SERGEI SITTING IN THE PIT, CATCHES OFF THE PLANT.
YOU1000000144_S0000046	SIMPLE WAS GOING BERSERK WITH THE P250. MY GOD, WHAT IS THAT?
YOU1000000144_S0000096	TIZIAN PUSHING THROUGH RAMP AGAIN IT SEEMS TO MAKE SURE HE HAS THAT INFORMATION THAT WILL HELP TO PLANT THE BOMB AND INDEED S1MPLE'S GOT AN AWP BUT THERE ARE 30 SECONDS ON THE CLOCK.
YOU1000000144_S0000099	THE BOSS WITH THE AWP AND NEXT HE'S GOT SO MUCH TO WORRY ABOUT AND S1MPLE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT TO DO TAKES HIM OUT
YOU1000000144_S0000131	HE'S BEEN SO FAR REMOVED THE DISADVANTAGE NOW AS HE DOES LOOK TOWARDS A. HE'LL HAVE THE GAP MAP. OH, JUST LOOKS AWAY AS HE CROSSES AS WELL.
YOU1000000147_S0000049	THE MEAT COMES FROM PRIZED FREE RANGE BLOND D'AQUITAINE CATTLE AND IS PRODUCED BY PARISIAN BUTCHER ALEXANDRE POLMARD ON HIS FAMILY FARM IN NORTHEASTERN FRANCE.
YOU1000000148_S0000043	ALL RIGHT, SO THIS IS MICHELLE OBAMA AND MYSELF. I THINK WE'RE IN STRASBOURG. SHE'S ONE OF THE NICEST PERSON I'VE MET, YOU KNOW, IN THAT TIME, IN THAT WORLD. SHE'S A VERY WARM PERSON, VERY KIND.
YOU1000000148_S0000058	OKAY, THIS IS SEPTEMBER 2017, THE JENNIFER SATCHEZ TRIBUTE SHOW. SOME OF THE GIRLS I GET TO SEE OFTEN, YOU KNOW, I NEVER LOST TOUCH WITH NAOMI AND HELENA CHRISTENSEN. SOMETIMES I SEND MESSAGE TO CINDY,
YOU1000000148_S0000062	I'M SO HAPPY THAT DONATELLA HAD THAT IDEA. IT WAS SO MOVING FOR US.
YOU1000000148_S0000076	AND MYSELF DID THE PICTURES SITTING OUTSIDE MY HOUSE, WEARING CELINE JEANS.
YOU1000000150_S0000013	LET'S YOU KNOW THAT IT'S BEEN DONE BY A MAN. OBVIOUSLY IF IT'D BEEN A JAPANESE PERSON, THEY'D PROBABLY BEEN IT DEAD STRAIGHT, BUT THAT'S BRITISH THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LIKE IN ENGLAND AND IT'S A BIT LIKE JOHN LENNON'S VOICE THE FACT THAT IT'S IMPERFECT IS WHAT MAKES IT SO PERFECT
YOU1000000152_S0000044	BASICALLY, YEAH, FRANCOIS, RINALD, AND BRUCE ARE THE ONLY TWO THAT OWN THIS.
YOU1000000152_S0000055	THAT BRUCE DESIGNED AND CREATED. AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE PIECES.
YOU1000000152_S0000140	DRIVING BY THE STORE, PULLED OVER, WENT INTO THE STORE AND SAID TO THE MANAGER, I WANT TO BUY THIS CAMERA. AND THE GUY SAID, EVERY CAMERA IN THE STORE IS FOR SALE, BUT NOT THIS ONE. AND BRUCE WOULD SAY, EVERYTHING'S FOR SALE.
YOU1000000152_S0000159	OUT OF THE 25 FOOT SCREEN AND THEN GO BACK IN. THIS IS WHAT BRUCE CALLS ADDICTIVE LUXURY.
YOU1000000153_S0000026	WE'VE DONE THAT SO IF WE EVER NEED A MOVE WE CAN PULL IT ALL APART. IT WOULD BE A DIFFICULT TASK, IT WOULDN'T BE SIMPLE, BUT IT CAN BE DONE AND WE CAN TAKE IT TO OUR NEXT PARKING SPOT.
YOU1000000154_S0000109	THE ARCHITECT DAVID HERTZ, HE'S BASED OUT OF VENICE.
YOU1000000154_S0000122	PUTTING ON A SEALER, OIL BASED SEALER. SO THIS IS CEDAR WOOD AND IT'S BEEN TONGUE AND GROOVE MILLED. AGAIN, IT'S A SELECTION FROM DAVID HERTZ.
YOU1000000154_S0000124	WHO LIKES TO USE NOT ONLY SOME INDUSTRIAL ELEMENTS LIKE THIS RAILING, BUT NATURAL ELEMENTS THAT ARE RECYCLABLE AND ORGANIC.

YOU1000000159_S0000036	ALL OF THESE FACTORS COMBINE TO MAKE OVERWATCH A SINGULARLY SPECIAL SHOOTER, AND ONE THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE WITHOUT HESITATION.
YOU1000000159_S0000038	PERSONA 5 WAS ALREADY A STRONG FRONTRUNNER FOR BEING THE BEST JRPG EVER MADE, AND ROYAL REALLY GETS ME WONDERING WHAT ELSE COULD EVEN COMPETE.
YOU1000000160_S0000047	A PICTURE IN PICTURE FORMAT ALSO ALLOWS PLAYERS TO WATCH MIXER STREAMS WHILE THEY PLAY THEIR OWN GAMES. PLUS, NINJA HAS JOINED THE MIXER PARTY, GIVING THE WHOLE SERVICE A LOT OF LEGITIMACY AND FANFARE.
YOU1000000160_S0000053	NINJA HAS GARNERED A TON OF PRESS FOR HIS SWITCH, AND BY THE TIME THE XBOX 2 GETS RELEASED, THE PLATFORM COULD HAVE AN EVEN LARGER VIEWING AUDIENCE.
YOU1000000161_S0000005	BUT ONLY 18 DURING HIS PLAYING CAREER. EACH ONE REPRESENTING A DIFFERENT STAGE, A DIFFERENT TIME. NOT JUST IN MICHAEL JORDAN'S CAREER, BUT YOUR LIFE.
YOU1000000161_S0000219	I THINK OF THE JORDANS THIS TIME TO HIS CAREER. WE STILL HAVE ONE HIGHLIGHT LEFT.
YOU1000000161_S0000271	SO THERE YOU HAVE IT, EVERY GAME WORN JORDAN UNBOXED HERE, THANKS TO MY FRIEND, BRAD HALL.
YOU1000000164_S0000006	MILA JOVOVICH RETURNS TO CLOSE OUT THE SCI FI HORROR FRANCHISE SHE'S LED FOR MORE THAN A DECADE.
YOU1000000164_S0000039	LIKE DISNEY'S EARLIER BEAUTY, THIS VERSION DRAWS INSPIRATION FROM THE CLASSIC FAIRY TALE ABOUT A PRINCE, PLAYED HERE BY DAN STEVENS.
YOU1000000164_S0000047	HOWEVER, DIRECTOR DEAN ISRAELITE'S TAKE ON THE STORY OFFERS A MUCH MORE SERIOUS AND EMOTIONALLY CHARGED COUNTER.

YOU1000000164_S0000174	HEY DAN!
YOU1000000165_S0000007	20. ROBERT DOWNEY JR. THERE ARE FEW GREATER STORIES OF REDEMPTION IN SHOW BUSINESS THAN THAT OF THIS ICONIC ACTOR.
YOU1000000165_S0000021	THIS TALENTED ACTOR FIRST CAME TO THE PUBLIC'S ATTENTION IN THE EARLY 90S, BREAKING OUT WITH PERFORMANCES IN FRIDAY AND JERRY MAGUIRE.
YOU1000000165_S0000038	NUMBER 18, ADAM DRIVER. THOUGH HIS CHARACTER'S ACTIONS OFTEN MADE HIM HARD TO WATCH, ADAM DRIVER DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF AS A TALENTED PERFORMER
YOU1000000165_S0000042	AND A STAR IN BLOCKBUSTER FILMS, BUT DRIVER CAN APPARENTLY DO IT ALL.
YOU1000000165_S0000051	SPEAKING OF ACTORS WHO CAN SCORE BIG BOTH AT THE BOX OFFICE AND IN TERMS OF AWARD NOMINATIONS,
YOU1000000165_S0000063	NUMBER 16. SCARLETT JOHANSSON.
YOU1000000165_S0000065	ALONGSIDE ROBERT DOWNEY JR., SCARJO IS A MEMBER OF THE TEAM THAT REDEFINED THE SUPERHERO GENRE OVER THE LAST DECADE AS THE INFINITY SAGA PLAYED OUT.
YOU1000000165_S0000073	15. MARGOT ROBBIE
YOU1000000165_S0000074	IT MIGHT BE HARD TO BELIEVE CONSIDERING HER CURRENT POP CULTURE OMNIPRESENCE, BUT LIKE JENNIFER LAWRENCE, THIS TALENTED ACTOR ENDED THE DECADE WHILE STILL IN HER 20S.
YOU1000000165_S0000081	NUMBER 14, MAHERSHALA ALI. NOT EVERY ACTOR HAS THEIR TALENTS RECOGNIZED IN THEIR 20S. AN ESTABLISHED TV PERFORMER, MAHERSHALA ALI
YOU1000000165_S0000124	AND YOU KNOW WHY I GOT THIS FROM MRS. SHAW.
YOU1000000165_S0000144	AN INCREDIBLY PHYSICAL ACTOR, WHO'S ABLE TO CONVEY COMPLEX AND INTENSE EMOTION EVEN WHEN SAYING FEW WORDS. TOM HARDY SHINES IN BLOCKBUSTERS AND SMALLER FILMS ALIKE.
YOU1000000165_S0000145	ONE NEED ONLY LOOK AT HIS POLAR CONTRASTING ROLES IN WARRIOR AND LOCKE, THE LATTER SET ENTIRELY IN A CAR, TO APPRECIATE HIS VERSATILITY. IF ONLY THE ACADEMY WOULD PAY ATTENTION MORE OFTEN.
YOU1000000165_S0000204	NOT UNLIKE AMY ADAMS, THIS ACCLAIMED ACTOR TENDS TO KEEP A RELATIVELY LOWER PROFILE FOR SOMEONE OF HIS STATUS. BUT HIS FILMOGRAPHY REVEALS JUST HOW TALENTED AN ACTOR HE REALLY IS.
YOU1000000165_S0000211	HE'S JUST ABOUT THE LAST ACTOR WE EXPECTED TO SEE BATTLING SPIDEY, BUT WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT, HE'S JUST AS GOOD IN A MASSIVE BLOCKBUSTER AS IN A GRITTY DRAMA OR A PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER.
YOU1000000165_S0000212	TO PETER PARKER!
YOU1000000165_S0000251	IN 2008, PHOENIX ANNOUNCED HE WAS RETIRING FROM ACTING. THANKFULLY, IT WAS AN ELABORATE RUSE FOR THE 2010 MOCKUMENTARY I'M STILL HERE.
YOU1000000166_S0000008	GRUMPY YODA.
YOU1000000166_S0000010	GRANDPA YODA.
YOU1000000166_S0000014	DARTH VADER
YOU1000000166_S0000016	DARTH VADER.
YOU1000000166_S0000046	AND IT TURNS OUT THAT IT'S NOT JUST SCIENTIFIC PRECEDENT, BUT AN EXPLANATION HERE FOR ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE ENTIRE YODA SPECIES.
YOU1000000166_S0000056	THAT'S OFFICIALLY CANON ANYMORE. SO INSTEAD OF SPENDING THIS ENTIRE EPISODE SAYING THE WORD YODA AND HAVING TO CLARIFY BETWEEN WHETHER I'M TALKING ABOUT YODA THE SPECIES OR YODA THE INDIVIDUAL MEMBER OF THAT SPECIES,
YOU1000000166_S0000059	HONESTLY, YOU GOT ORIGINAL YODA, YOU GOT YADDLE FROM THE PHANTOM MENACE WHO JUST APPEARS FOR A COUPLE SECONDS, AND BABY YODA, WHATEVER HIS NAME ENDS UP BEING FROM THE MANDALORIAN.
YOU1000000166_S0000108	WE CAN SEE THAT BABY YODA IS AN EXTREME VERSION OF THIS PRINCIPLE, WITH A WILDLY HUGE AND MERCHANDISABLE HEAD,
YOU1000000166_S0000109	AND A TEENY TINY BODY, MAKING ME THINK THAT BABY YODA IS AN EXTREMELY EVOLVED VERSION OF WHAT THE HUMAN RACE COULD LOOK LIKE SOMEDAY.
YOU1000000167_S0000031	BUT WHICH WERE PRESENTS NEVERTHELESS, AND AS EEYORE HAD SAID, THAT WAS SOMETHING.
YOU1000000167_S0000037	"'I'VE HEARD,' SAID CHRISTOPHER ROBIN, WHO KNEW A GREAT DEAL ABOUT FAR AWAY PLACES LIKE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FOREST AND LONDON.
YOU1000000167_S0000079	AND SO IT WAS DECIDED, AND OWL WAS CALLED FOR. OWL FUSSED HERE AND FUSSED THERE,
YOU1000000167_S0000089	PIGLET HELD ON VERY TIGHTLY TO THE BALLOON. HE WASN'T QUITE SURE WHAT A CROWD WAS. SOMETHING LIKE A DARK CLOUD, PERHAPS,
YOU1000000167_S0000092	SO THE PRESENTS WERE READY, AND SIDE BY SIDE, WINNIE THE POOH, EDWARD BEAR, BEAR OF VERY LITTLE BRAIN, BRAVE ADVENTURER,
YOU1000000167_S0000093	AND LOYAL FRIEND HIS SMALL COMPANION PIGLET EEYORE AND CHRISTOPHER ROBIN SET OFF FOR LONDON
YOU1000000167_S0000136	WE'LL CALL THIS THE BLUSTERY BUS, LAUGHED CHRISTOPHER ROBIN.
YOU1000000167_S0000162	"'I FEEL SURE,' SAID POOH, "'THAT WITH THIS CLOCK I COULD REALLY LEARN TO TELL THE TIME. WITH SMALLER CLOCKS I DO TRY TO TELL IT, BUT IT JUST DOESN'T LISTEN.'
YOU1000000167_S0000193	WHOSE VOICE FADED OFF INTO A HAPPY DREAM.
YOU1000000167_S0000220	PIGLET HANDED HIM THE BEAUTIFUL BALLOON, AND HE GIGGLED AND SKIPPED AWAY WITH IT.
YOU1000000167_S0000228	I BELIEVE I SAW THE QUEEN AT ONE OF THE WINDOWS, HE ANNOUNCED PROUDLY. BUT YOU, BEGAN PIGLET, THE QUEEN JUST— AHEM!
YOU1000000167_S0000231	LATER, WHEN THE STORY HAD BEEN RETOLD OVER AND OVER AGAIN, WINNIE THE POOH WAS SURE THAT THE QUEEN HAD SAID, OH, CHARMING.
YOU1000000167_S0000241	IT MUST BE A VERY GREAT THING TO BE NINETY YEARS OLD, MUSED POOH.
YOU1000000168_S0000002	WITH YOUR NEWEST ANIMAL COMPANION. WELL, YOU COULD BRAVE THE MISSION AND OPT FOR A BENGAL TIGER LIKE MIKE TYSON. BUT A FULL GROWN WILDCAT IS QUITE A PIECE OF WORK.
YOU1000000168_S0000095	CELEBRITIES, SUCH AS PARIS HILTON, IS KNOWN TO OWN A KINKAJOU AND A SUGAR GLIDER. BUT THE RICH AND FAMOUS AREN'T THE ONLY ONES WHO FIND THESE ANIMALS ADORABLE.
YOU1000000169_S0000035	USING CRATE LOADS OF TOYS, JOHN AND HIS COLLEAGUES DEVISED A GROUNDBREAKING STUDY OF CANINE INTELLIGENCE.
YOU1000000169_S0000043	JOHN NEVER LOOKS AT THE TOYS ON THE MAT, SO TO PICK THE RIGHT OBJECT, CHASER HAS TO ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT HE'S SAYING.
YOU1000000169_S0000055	CHASE, GET MEOW. I WANT MEOW. DO IT, GIRL, DO IT. RIGHT NOW.
YOU1000000169_S0000059	GET ME OUT. DO IT. DO IT.
YOU1000000169_S0000114	DOGS LIKE LOLA BARK AS SOON AS THEY GET A WHIFF OF A BEAR.
YOU1000000169_S0000118	FOR LOLA HERE, HOW CLOSE HAS SHE BEEN TO A POLAR BEAR?
YOU1000000169_S0000139	I THOUGHT AT THE TIME MAX WAS FADING. HE WAS NINE AND A HALF.
YOU1000000169_S0000149	MAUREEN HAD A SMALL LUMP IN HER BREAST, BUT HER LATEST MAMMOGRAM WAS CLEAR, SO SHE PRESUMED ALL WAS OK.
YOU1000000169_S0000172	I LOVE MAC SO MUCH AND I OWE HIM SO MUCH.
YOU1000000169_S0000184	THEY CAN EVEN BE TAUGHT TO LET DIABETICS LIKE STEPHEN KNOW THAT HIS BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS ARE SMELLING LOW LONG BEFORE HE CAN FEEL IT
YOU1000000172_S0000116	I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF CHRISTINA.
YOU1000000173_S0000139	ACE USES A CUMMINS V903C ENGINE CAPABLE OF 295 HORSEPOWER AND A TOP SPEED OF 30 MILES PER HOUR.
YOU1000000175_S0000002	BUT WITH THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA, JUST THE SCALE, THE SCOPE AND THE SPEED OF IT IS REALLY AMPED UP. I'M DR. SEEMA YASMIN AND I'M A DOCTOR
YOU1000000178_S0000004	HELLO, MY NAME IS MICHAEL PHILLIPS. I'M THE 2010 WORLD BARISTA CHAMPION AND THE DIRECTOR OF EDUCATION FOR BLUE BOTTLE COFFEE INTERNATIONALLY.

YOU1000000181_S0000025	CONFUCIUS, BUDDHA AND LAOZI.
YOU1000000181_S0000031	I ASKED MASTER GU HOW IT COULD BE POSSIBLE LAO TZU COULD KEEP ON SMILING WHEN TASTING THIS HORRIBLE VINEGAR.
YOU1000000183_S0000005	HEY GUYS, WELCOME BACK TO THE CHANNEL. IN THIS VIDEO, WE ARE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT SOME INVESTING LESSONS THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM PETER LYNCH.
YOU1000000183_S0000093	BUT THEN WHAT PETER LYNCH TALKS ABOUT IN THIS ENVIRONMENT WHERE BASICALLY EVERYTHING'S OVERVALUED, WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO TRY AND FIND COMPANIES THAT ARE JUST FAIRLY VALUED.
YOU1000000183_S0000105	AND JUST QUICKLY, THE OTHER THING TO NOTE FROM WHAT PETER LYNCH SAID IN THIS LITTLE CLIP WAS WHEN HE SAID, IF A STOCK IS TRADING AT A HUGE MULTIPLE, IT BASICALLY HAS TO WORK.
YOU1000000183_S0000120	THE THIRD KEY STEP THAT PETER LYNCH HIGHLIGHTS IN THIS CLIP IS TO ALWAYS FOCUS ON THE LONG TERM.
YOU1000000183_S0000140	YOU KNOW, I REALLY LIKE THIS LAST CLIP FROM PETER LYNCH. IT'S JUST A LESSON. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET TOO FANCY, RIGHT? YOU DON'T HAVE TO DRIFT INTO THINGS THAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. LIKE A LOT OF STOCK INVESTORS,
YOU1000000183_S0000141	THEY ARE JUST ALL OVER OPTIONS. PETER LYNCH IS THE FIRST TO PUT HIS HAND UP AND SAYS, LOOK, I LOVE INVESTING IN COMPANIES. I DON'T HAVE A CLUE WHAT'S GOING ON WHEN IT COMES TO OPTIONS. NEVER BOUGHT AN OPTION IN MY LIFE.
YOU1000000183_S0000150	JUST BECAUSE MARKET WAS HIGH THEN, MARKET'S HIGH NOW, EVERYTHING THAT HE'S SAYING IS ALMOST DIRECTLY APPLICABLE INTO WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH OUR INVESTING TODAY.
YOU1000000184_S0000001	I'M BOB KLEIN FROM LOS ANGELES. I WONDER IF YOU COULD GIVE US A GLIMPSE INTO YOUR INVESTMENT PROCESS, THE WAY YOU APPROACH LOOKING AT A PARTICULAR INDUSTRY. AND I WONDER IF YOU COULD USE REAL ESTATE AS AN EXAMPLE.
YOU1000000184_S0000015	WE'VE BOTH HAD A FAIR AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCE IN REAL ESTATE, AND CHARLIE MADE HIS EARLY MONEY IN REAL ESTATE.
YOU1000000184_S0000082	YEAH, MOBILE OIL WAS INTERESTED IN, YOU KNOW, DON BRENN ENDED UP PUTTING TOGETHER A GROUP FOR IT. BUT, YOU KNOW, THAT KIND OF THING.
YOU1000000185_S0000008	WE VALUE THEIR PARTNERSHIP AND WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO HAVE BILL AND MELINDA GATES WITH US HERE TODAY.
YOU1000000185_S0000027	MELINDA, WHEN DO YOU THINK WE'LL SEE A VACCINE AT SCALE? AND A TWO PART QUESTION,
YOU1000000185_S0000064	SO, YOU KNOW, THAT REMINDS ME OF GOING BACK TO THE VACCINE, MELINDA, AND I PROMISED TO MOVE OFF OF IT, BUT, YOU KNOW, WE'VE NEVER HAD A VACCINE FOR CORONAVIRUS,
YOU1000000185_S0000074	AND DO YOU THINK, BILL, THE SAME THING IS TRUE ON THERAPEUTICS AND TESTING? I MEAN, DO YOU THINK THAT THE WAY THAT THINGS ARE COMING TOGETHER WILL GET US WHERE WE NEED TO BE
YOU1000000185_S0000087	AND PARTICULARLY PRESIDENT BUSH AND PEPFAR DID HELPING OUT THE ENTIRE WORLD.
YOU1000000185_S0000149	LIKE YOU, SUZANNE, I HAVE CHANGED. I'VE CLAIMED THAT WHEN I GO BACK TO WORK, I WILL NOT BE WEARING HEELS. I AM GOING TO WEAR MY TENNIS SHOES BECAUSE I WEAR THEM ALL THE TIME NOW
YOU1000000186_S0000049	AND BILL GATES,
YOU1000000186_S0000132	SO BILL GATES, WHEN YOU MEET INDIAN ENTREPRENEURS, BILLIONAIRES, ARE YOU GETTING ANY TRACTION WITH THEM THAT THEY SHOULD ALSO DONATE TO THE SECOND MIRACLE, A MIRACLE OF SAY VACCINES?
YOU1000000186_S0000147	THEY WERE ACTUALLY A FEW YEARS, EVEN BEFORE ROCKEFELLER AND CARNEGIE.
YOU1000000188_S0000015	DOLLY'S FANTASTIC CREATION CAN BE ENJOYED AT THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART IN NEW YORK.
YOU1000000188_S0000020	JUST ONE OF THE MANY HIGHLIGHTS OF THE BELVEDERE IN VIENNA'S EXTENSIVE COLLECTION, THE KISS IS KLIMT'S MOST POPULAR AND ENTHRALLING WORK.
YOU1000000188_S0000035	CLAUDE MONET'S WATER LILY SERIES WAS PAINTED AT HIS HOME IN GIVERNY BETWEEN 1896 AND 1926.
YOU1000000188_S0000046	NUMBER 5. THE SCREAM. THE SCREAM IS A SERIES OF EXPRESSIONIST PAINTINGS AND PRINTS BY NORWEGIAN ARTIST EDVARD MUNCH.
YOU1000000188_S0000063	THIS POPULAR THEORY PLAYS A CENTRAL ROLE IN DAN BROWN'S NOVEL, THE DA VINCI CODE.
YOU1000000189_S0000111	BUT YOU CAN CORRECT IT. IT JUST TAKES SOME EFFORT ON OUR PART TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT. WHO SAID THAT? HIPPOCRATES, YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT. LET FOOD BE MEDICINE, LET MEDICINE BE FOOD.
YOU1000000191_S0000031	THIS ONE'S ALWAYS RIGHT.
YOU1000000191_S0000036	WE HAVEN'T GOT MARCO AND FINN UNFORTUNATELY. THEY ARE STILL IN FINLAND WITH THIS WHOLE THING GOING ON.
YOU1000000191_S0000040	I AM. AND THEN KAYLEIGH'S HERE AS WELL. CHAUVEL, HOW BIG IS THIS HOLE GOING TO BE?

POD1000000004_S0000001	MILLION BAZILLION IS A NEW PODCAST FOR KIDS AND THEIR FAMILIES. IT'S ALL ABOUT MONEY, HOW IT WORKS, HOW WE USE IT, WHERE IT COMES FROM, AND HOW WE COULD ALL GET A LITTLE BIT SMARTER ABOUT IT, BUT IN A FUN WAY.
POD1000000004_S0000003	LEILA GREEN IS A TRAUMA SURGEON IN HOUSTON.
POD1000000004_S0000005	WELL, THEN I GUESS I SHOULD BE GLAD WE DIDN'T MEET IN REAL LIFE. BEFORE LEELA COULD BECOME DR. GREEN, SHE HAD TO DO A WHOLE LOT OF TRAINING.
POD1000000004_S0000010	WHAT GREEN IS CONVENIENTLY LEAVING OUT OF HER STORY IS HER LEVEL OF COOKING EXPERIENCE PRE MEAL KIT.
POD1000000004_S0000018	GETTING A MEAL KIT EVERY WEEK DID FORCE GREEN TO UPGRADE HER KITCHEN UTENSIL GAME. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT GAVE HER BACK TIME, SOMETHING THAT AS A TRAUMA SURGEON, SHE DOES NOT TAKE FOR GRANTED.
POD1000000004_S0000019	PLUS, THE MEAL KITS HELP GREEN HONE HER COOKING SKILLS. FORGET JUST PRESSING COOK ON THE MICROWAVE. GREEN IS NOW A MASTER IN THE FINE ART OF MISE EN PLACE.
POD1000000004_S0000025	IN THE YEAR THAT GREEN SUBSCRIBED TO THAT MEAL KIT DELIVERY SERVICE, SHE MADE SEARED STEAK AND PIZZA FROM SCRATCH AND A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER THINGS SHE WOULD NEVER NORMALLY PREPARE FOR HERSELF. AND SHE DOCUMENTED HER COOKING JOURNEY ON INSTAGRAM.
POD1000000004_S0000026	BUT EVENTUALLY, GREEN FINISHED HER TRAINING AND GOT BACK TO A MORE REGULAR SCHEDULE, WHICH ALLOWED FOR GROCERY SHOPPING AND MEAL PREP. SO SHE CANCELED HER SUBSCRIPTION.
POD1000000004_S0000037	SLASH MARIN. SLASH...
POD1000000004_S0000047	I'M LAUREN OBERYN FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA. WELCOME TO THE NEW SEASON OF SPECTACULAR FAILURES, THE SHOW THAT ALWAYS FLAMBES THE HELL OUT OF FAILURE.
POD1000000004_S0000049	LEGEND HAS IT THAT THE IDEA FOR BLUE APRON BEGAN WITH AN ARGENTINIAN STEAK. THERE WERE THESE TWO GUYS, MATT SALZBERG AND ELIA PAPPAS, AND THEY WERE CLEVER TECH ENTREPRENEUR TYPES.
POD1000000004_S0000050	FULL OF IDEAS. SALZBERG HAD AN MBA FROM HARVARD AND CUT HIS TEETH IN A BIG NEW YORK VENTURE CAPITAL FIRM. PAPPAS WAS A GO GETTER SOFTWARE ENGINEER. THEY MET AT A NETWORK Y HAPPY HOUR AND DECIDED TO GO INTO BUSINESS TOGETHER.
POD1000000004_S0000053	THAT'S ALEX CONRAD. HE'S A SENIOR EDITOR AT FORBES. HE WROTE ABOUT THE FOUNDERS IN 2015. PETRI DISH WASN'T THE PAIR'S ONLY STARTUP IDEA.
POD1000000004_S0000054	I THINK ANOTHER ONE WE HIGHLIGHTED IN OUR ARTICLE WAS WARBY PARKER FOR STROLLERS.
POD1000000004_S0000059	SALZBURG AND PAPPAS ARE DOING DINNER AND THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO MAKE ARGENTINIAN STEAKS ON A BORROWED GRILL.
POD1000000004_S0000061	IN FACT, THERE WAS, BUT IT WAS IN SWEDEN. IN 2007, A WOMAN NAMED KIKI TANDER CREATED A COMPANY CALLED...
POD1000000004_S0000065	T AND R WANTED TO SOLVE THE VEXING NIGHTLY PROBLEM THAT FAMILIES AROUND THE WORLD FACE. WHAT ARE WE HAVING FOR DINNER? BECAUSE THE ANSWER CAN'T ALWAYS BE ICE CREAM.
POD1000000004_S0000069	FOR SALZBURG AND PAPPAS, THE ANSWER TO BOTH OF THOSE QUESTIONS WAS AN ENTHUSIASTIC YES. NOW, AT THIS POINT, IT WAS 2012, AND T. ANDERS COMPANY HAD BEEN AROUND FOR FIVE YEARS AND WAS GROWING STEADILY.
POD1000000004_S0000070	IT HAD A FEW COMPETITORS IN EUROPE, BUT IN THE US, NOTHING OF THE SORT EXISTED, WHICH WAS GREAT FOR SALZBURG AND PAPPAS.
POD1000000004_S0000073	AT ALMOST THE EXACT SAME TIME, A HARVARD CLASSMATE OF SALZBURG'S BEGAN A RIVAL MEAL KIT COMPANY CALLED PLATED. BUT SALZBURG AND PAPPAS WEREN'T WORRIED BECAUSE THEY HAD BROUGHT ON A RINGER.
POD1000000004_S0000074	MATT WADIAK, A CHEF WITH A DEGREE FROM THE PRESTIGIOUS CULINARY INSTITUTE OF AMERICA. AND WADIAK WAS THE GUY THAT WAS GOING TO MAKE THEIR BUSINESS STAND APART FROM ITS RIVALS.
POD1000000004_S0000075	WADIAK WOULD BASICALLY GO AND SOURCE THE INGREDIENTS. FARMERS WOULD SAY, OKAY, WE WOULD LOVE TO LOCK IN THESE LARGE EXTRA ORDERS,
POD1000000004_S0000077	NOT ONLY DID WADIAK DESIGN THE MENUS AND SOURCE THE PRODUCTS, BUT HE ALSO SERVED AS THE SOCIAL MEDIA FACE OF THE COMPANY. HE WAS BLUE APRON'S CULINARY SECRET WEAPON AND DID A SERIES OF EARLY YOUTUBE VIDEOS SHOWCASING HIS KNOW HOW.
POD1000000004_S0000083	IN THE EARLY DAYS, ALL THE FOUNDERS HAD TO HUSTLE LIKE THIS. BEFORE THEY HAD STAFF, IT WAS SALZBURG, PAPPAS, AND WADIAK PACKING UP BOXES IN A SMALL KITCHEN IN LONG ISLAND CITY, NEW YORK.
POD1000000004_S0000087	BLUE APRON SEEMED TO BE SORT OF THE BUZZIEST, THE BIGGEST MARKET SHARE, THE LEADER IN THIS EMERGING CATEGORY.
POD1000000004_S0000089	THEN I ACTUALLY TRIED THE PRODUCTS AND IT SEEMED AT LEAST TO ME PERSONALLY, JUST AS SOMEONE TESTING THE PRODUCTS, THAT BLUE APRON OVERALL KIND OF HAD THE EXPERIENCE THAT RESONATED THE MOST WITH ME AND I THOUGHT MIGHT RESONATE THE MOST WITH AMERICANS.
POD1000000004_S0000091	WE LOVE PRODUCTS THAT CLAIM TO MAKE OUR LIVES EASIER, MORE CONVENIENT, LESS OF A HASSLE. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT BLUE APRON WAS DOING. IT WAS SAYING, HEY, WORKING MOM, WE KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT ON YOUR PLATE, LOL.
POD1000000004_S0000096	THIS AMERICAN OBSESSION WITH CONVENIENCE AROUND FOOD, AND IN PARTICULAR THE MAGICAL HOME COOKED MEAL MINUS THE EFFORT, GOES BACK TO AT LEAST THE LATE 19TH CENTURY, SAYS CULINARY HISTORIAN LAURA SHAPIRO.
POD1000000004_S0000104	MOTHER MURPHY, LUCKY ME. MY WIFE USES SWANSON TV TURKEY DINNERS. AND MAKE YOUR HUSBAND LUCKY, TOO. GET SWANSON TV TURKEY DINNERS, SWANSON TV FRIED CHICKEN DINNERS,
POD1000000004_S0000107	MASTER CHAD MORLEY ATE MRS. PAUL'S FISH STICKS WITH HIS FINGERS.
POD1000000004_S0000109	MRS. PAUL'S FISH STICKS. YOU NEVER STOP LOVING THEM.
POD1000000004_S0000120	NOTICE SHAPIRO SAID FEELING AS THOUGH YOU COOKED SOMETHING. BECAUSE FOR HER, WHAT BLUE APRON IS DOING, DESPITE ALL OF ITS FRESH INGREDIENTS AND CHEF INSPIRED RECIPES, IS HELPING YOU ASSEMBLE.
POD1000000004_S0000130	THAT'S DAN MCCARTHY. HE'S A MARKETING PROFESSOR AT EMORY UNIVERSITY'S BUSINESS SCHOOL, AND HE'S STUDIED BLUE APRON FOR YEARS. MCCARTHY SAYS THAT IN THE EARLY DAYS, BLUE APRON WAS SPENDING ABOUT $60, $70 PER CUSTOMER.
POD1000000004_S0000131	BUT THEN, AS PEOPLE CAME AND WENT, BLUE APRON HAD TO SPEND MORE AND MORE MONEY TO GET NEW CUSTOMERS ON BOARD. THE CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COST JUST KEPT CREEPING UP AND UP AND UP UNTIL IT NEARLY DOUBLED.
POD1000000004_S0000137	OUR PAL DR. GREEN USED BLUE APRON FOR ABOUT A YEAR, WHICH IS WAY LONGER THAN MOST OF ITS CUSTOMERS STUCK AROUND.
POD1000000004_S0000144	AND SO BLUE APRON WAS AT A CROSSROAD, SAYS ALEX CONRAD.
POD1000000004_S0000147	SO BLUE APRON HAD THREE CHOICES, PACK IT IN, SELL, OR GO PUBLIC. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK. WHEN WE COME BACK, JOIN ME IN MY OUTDATED CONDO KITCHEN AS I WHIP UP SOME DELICIOUS BLUE APRON MEALS.
POD1000000004_S0000166	NO STORY ABOUT BLUE APRON COULD BE CALLED COMPLETE WITHOUT SAMPLING THE PRODUCT. SO I ORDERED UP A BOX. AND PAID FOR IT, MIND YOU.
POD1000000004_S0000171	WHICH ACCORDING TO THE BLUE APRON RECIPE WAS SUPPOSED TO QUOTE, LEND EVEN MORE SAVORY FLAVOR TO MY DISH. YUM.
POD1000000004_S0000183	OH, HANNAH, NO! GET YOUR HAND OUT OF THE GARBAGE DISPOSAL!
POD1000000004_S0000198	THAT ONE WASN'T AS EXCITING. BY THEN, I UNDERSTOOD THE GIMMICK, AND THE EXCITEMENT OF DISCOVERY KIND OF FIZZLED. IN THIS WAY, I'M NOT TOO DIFFERENT FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO TRY BLUE APRON, SAYS PROFESSOR DAN MCCARTHY.
POD1000000004_S0000206	BUT NONE OF THIS MARKETING RESULTED IN A HUGE NEW CUSTOMER HAUL. AND THAT, SAYS FORBES' ALEX CONRAD, MADE INVESTORS A LITTLE LESS IN LOVE WITH THE COMPANY.
POD1000000004_S0000207	IT WAS HARD TO MAKE A REALLY ATTRACTIVE, YOU KNOW, FUTURE FACING STORY FOR LIKE HOW BLUE APRON REALLY BECOMES THAT HUGE.
POD1000000004_S0000218	STILL, BLUE APRON CO FOUNDER AND CEO MATT SALZBERG SEEMED PRETTY UPBEAT ABOUT THE WHOLE SITUATION ON CNBC.
POD1000000004_S0000222	ONE THING SALZBURG MENTIONED IN THAT CLIP WAS HOW HIS COMPANY WAS TACKLING A HUGE MARKET. NOW, IF YOU'RE DEFINING THE MARKET AS ALL THE PEOPLE WHO EAT FOOD IN AMERICA, THEN YEAH, THAT'S A HUGE MARKET.
POD1000000004_S0000225	THAT'S KARA RASH. SHE'S A FOOD AND BEVERAGE ANALYST WITH PACKAGED FACTS.
POD1000000004_S0000227	IT'S HARD TO GAUGE, BUT RASH ESTIMATES THAT ONLY ABOUT 1% OF THE US POPULATION USES HOME DELIVERY MEAL KITS. AND SHE SAYS THE MARKET KIND OF PEAKED TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO.
POD1000000004_S0000229	REMEMBER WHEN WE SAID AMAZON TRADEMARKED ITS MEAL KIT BACK IN 2017? RASH SAYS THE COMPANY NEVER DID MUCH WITH IT, AND THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD INDICATOR THAT MEAL KIT DELIVERY IS NOT A GROWING GLOBAL CONCERN.
POD1000000004_S0000232	AND THERE WERE MORE PROBLEMS. WITHIN A MONTH OF THE IPO, CO FOUNDER MATT WADIAK STEPPED DOWN AS COO. MATT SALZBERG, THEN THE CEO, RESIGNED HIS POST SHORTLY THEREAFTER.
POD1000000004_S0000235	WELCOME TO TRADING NATION. I'M ERIC CHUMMEY. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT ONE OF LAST YEAR'S HIGH PROFILE IPOS THAT'S GETTING ABSOLUTELY SMOKED. WE'RE TALKING, OF COURSE, ABOUT BLUE APRON. THE STOCK SINKING AS MUCH AS 4% ON FRIDAY.
POD1000000004_S0000239	THE MOVE RAISED THE COMPANY'S STOCK PRICE, BUT CUSTOMERS STILL WEREN'T FLOCKING TO BLUE APRON'S BOXES. NOW, AT THIS POINT, I WOULD HAVE THROWN IN THE TOWEL, BUT NOT CEO LINDA FINLEY KOZLOWSKI.
POD1000000004_S0000240	THE COMPANY WOULDN'T MAKE KOZLOWSKI AVAILABLE FOR A CHAT, BUT HERE SHE IS LAST YEAR ON CNBC'S SQUAWK ON THE STREET, TALKING ABOUT HOW JAZZED SHE IS ABOUT BLUE APRON'S PROSPECTS.
POD1000000004_S0000242	COOL, COOL, COOL. BUT ALSO, BLUE APRON WAS THINKING ABOUT GETTING DOWN WITH SOME STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES, SAYS MARKETWATCH'S TANYA GARCIA.
POD1000000004_S0000246	IN EARLY 2020, BLUE APRON PUT THE WORD OUT THAT IT WAS INTERESTED IN POSSIBLY GETTING SCOOPED UP, MAYBE BY A BIG GROCERY CHAIN OR SOMEONE ELSE WITH DEEP POCKETS WHO WANTED TO OWN A MEAL KIT DELIVERY BUSINESS.
POD1000000004_S0000247	AT THE SAME TIME, GARCIA SAYS, THE COMPANY ACTED LIKE IT WAS IN TURNAROUND MODE. IT DECIDED TO STREAMLINE OPERATIONS, INCLUDING SHUTTING DOWN ITS FULFILLMENT CENTER IN TEXAS.
POD1000000004_S0000260	THE PANDEMIC SEEMS LIKE IT'S GIVEN BLUE APRON A DECENT LITTLE BOOST. IN THE SECOND QUARTER, THE COMPANY BROUGHT IN 20,000 MORE SUBSCRIBERS, BUT THAT'S STILL WAY BELOW WHERE THEY WERE IN 2019.
POD1000000004_S0000268	SPECTACULAR FAILURES IS A PRODUCTION OF AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA. IT'S WRITTEN AND HOSTED BY ME, WORLD'S MOST FINICKY EATER, LAUREN OBER.

POD1000000004_S0000276	I HAD TO LIKE WEBMD MYSELF. I SAID, SOMETHING HAS DIED INSIDE OF ME.
POD1000000004_S0000278	WHY PEOPLE BEHAVE THE WAY THEY DID DURING THE PANDEMIC AND WHERE WE ALL MIGHT WIND UP IN THE DIFFICULT YEARS TO COME. HOST TIM HARFORD DRAWS FROM HISTORY AND SOCIAL SCIENCE TO VIVIDLY RETELL THE STORIES OF GREAT CRIMES, ACCIDENTS, AND DISASTERS OF THE PAST.
POD1000000010_S0000001	IN THIS EPISODE, HOW TO RAISE KIND KIDS. AND TO TRULY UNDERSTAND KINDNESS, ANYA AND I VISITED A MOTHER WHO'S LIVED THROUGH EVERY PARENT'S WORST NIGHTMARE.
POD1000000010_S0000004	HER NAME IS SCARLETT LEWIS. AND BEFORE WE MET HER, COREY, I HAVE TO CONFESS THAT I WASN'T NECESSARILY ALL THAT IMPRESSED WITH KINDNESS AS AN IDEA. I MEAN...
POD1000000010_S0000007	BUT THAT REALLY, REALLY CHANGED FOR ME WHEN WE TRAVELED TO RURAL CONNECTICUT TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH SCARLETT.
POD1000000010_S0000010	SCARLETT NAMED THIS PLACE WILD ROSE FARM. THERE ARE A FEW CHICKENS CLUCKING IN A WIRE COOP BEHIND A MUDDY PASTURE WHERE THERE'S ALSO A HORSE.
POD1000000010_S0000014	WE GET THERE IN TIME TO WATCH HER FEED THE ANIMALS, INCLUDING HER CONSTANT COMPANIONS, THREE DOGS, REMINGTON, ROCKY, AND OLIVE.
POD1000000010_S0000017	SO SCARLETT LEADS US INSIDE THE HOUSE, AND I REMEMBER WE TOOK OUR JACKETS OFF IN THE MUDROOM, AND HANGING THERE WAS A FIRST GRADER'S BLACK AND BLUE SKI JACKET.
POD1000000010_S0000018	AND SCARLETT STOPPED AND SHE PULLED OUT A PAIR OF THESE FUNNY LOOKING TEETH OUT OF THE POCKET, JOKE TEETH.
POD1000000010_S0000023	SCARLETT'S SON, JESSE, HAD THESE TEETH IN THIS COAT AT SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL THE DAY HE DIED.
POD1000000010_S0000024	MY NAME IS SCARLETT LEWIS AND I'M THE FOUNDER OF THE JESSE LEWIS CHOOSE LOVE MOVEMENT.
POD1000000010_S0000026	HERE IN SANDY HOOK, CONNECTICUT IN 2012, SCARLETT LIVED THROUGH EVERY PARENT'S NIGHTMARE.
POD1000000010_S0000030	EVERY SURFACE IS COVERED WITH PAINTINGS SCARLETT'S DONE AND PHOTOS OF JESSE AND HIS BROTHER JT.
POD1000000010_S0000031	AND ONE OF THE CABINETS HAS CHALKBOARD PAINT ON IT. AND ON IT IS A MESSAGE FROM JESSE.
POD1000000010_S0000033	SCARLETT DIDN'T NOTICE THIS MESSAGE UNTIL SHE RETURNED TO THE HOUSE SEVERAL DAYS AFTER THE SHOOTING TO FIND CLOTHES FOR JESSE TO WEAR IN HIS CASKET.
POD1000000010_S0000040	SCARLETT SAYS SHE HAS NO IDEA HOW OR WHERE HER LITTLE BOY CAME UP WITH THOSE THREE WORDS.
POD1000000010_S0000047	I'M ANYA KAMENETZ, AN EDUCATION REPORTER AND THE MOTHER OF TWO GIRLS.
POD1000000010_S0000048	AND I'M COREY TURNER, AN EDUCATION REPORTER AND THE FATHER OF TWO BOYS.
POD1000000010_S0000059	SO, COREY, YES, KINDNESS IS IMPORTANT, BUT I GUESS I ALWAYS ASSUMED THAT MY KIDS WOULD LEARN IT NATURALLY THROUGH OSMOSIS.
POD1000000010_S0000061	WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT, ANYA? YOU ARE NOT ALONE IN THAT ASSUMPTION.
POD1000000010_S0000064	THAT IS JENNIFER KOTLER. SHE'S ONE OF OUR EXPERT GUIDES TODAY. THROUGH WHAT TURNS OUT TO BE A PRETTY COMPLICATED SUBJECT,
POD1000000010_S0000069	EXHIBIT A IS THIS STUDY JEN POINTS TO OUT OF HARVARD A FEW YEARS BACK.
POD1000000010_S0000074	YEAH, AND THIS KIND OF LIKE SELF DELUSION, THIS IS JUST ONE OF MANY REASONS SCARLETT WORRIES THAT THIS CULTURE IS CREATING HUGE PROBLEMS.
POD1000000010_S0000077	AND OF COURSE, HER LIFE IS A REALLY STARK REMINDER, COREY, OF JUST HOW HIGH THE STAKES CAN BE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THINGS LIKE MENTAL HEALTH AND KIDS WHO ARE TROUBLED.
POD1000000010_S0000080	AFTER SHE READ THAT MESSAGE FROM JESSE, SCARLETT LEWIS REACHED OUT TO A TEAM OF RESEARCHERS AND EDUCATORS, AND SHE CREATED A PLAN TO ESSENTIALLY TEACH CHILDREN KINDNESS, STEP BY STEP, VALUE BY VALUE.
POD1000000010_S0000081	YEAH, THE JESSE LEWIS CHOOSE LOVE ENRICHMENT PROGRAM. THEY ESTIMATE IT'S NOW REACHED OVER A MILLION STUDENTS.
POD1000000010_S0000085	SO LET'S FOLLOW SCARLETT'S LEAD AND SESAME STREET'S AND TALK ABOUT HOW THE SCIENCE OF KINDNESS CAN TRANSLATE INTO ACTION.
POD1000000010_S0000095	THOMAS LACONA SAYS WE SEE SIGNS OF WHAT IS CALLED EMPATHIC DISTRESS, EVEN IN TINY BABIES.
POD1000000010_S0000098	AND TOM TOLD US THAT BABY'S MORAL SENSE SEEMS TO GO EVEN DEEPER.
POD1000000010_S0000100	SO THIS IS LIKE I WAS SAYING, COREY, I ALWAYS THOUGHT KIDS ARE JUST BORN TO BE KIND.
POD1000000010_S0000103	ONLY ABOUT A THIRD OF THE KIDS ACTUALLY RESPONDED IN THAT MOMENT WITH ALTRUISM, WITH KINDNESS, BY, SAY, GOING OVER TO THE CHILD, OFFERING A HUG, CALLING FOR AN ADULT.
POD1000000010_S0000104	ZACHARY!
POD1000000010_S0000106	LET'S CHECK ON HER BELLA, HE'S TRYING TO CHECK ON YOU
POD1000000010_S0000109	I GOT HOT FETA!
POD1000000010_S0000112	LET ME HELP YOU, GIRL!
POD1000000010_S0000138	AND THAT'S WHY SCARLETT SAYS.
POD1000000010_S0000144	THE JESSE LEWIS CHOOSE LOVE PROGRAM FOR KIDS FROM PRE K THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL ACTUALLY BEGINS WITH COURAGE.
POD1000000010_S0000145	AND I WANT TO MENTION THAT REPORTS OF THE SHOOTING SAID THAT JESSE HIMSELF SHOWED INCREDIBLE COURAGE.
POD1000000010_S0000147	YEAH, AND SCARLET'S DEFINITION OF COURAGE IS EVEN BIGGER THAN THAT SORT OF
POD1000000010_S0000154	IT'S ALSO, SCARLETT SAYS, THE COURAGE TO STAND UP TO SOMEONE WHO'S BULLYING YOU OR SOMEONE YOU KNOW BY TAKING THEIR PERSPECTIVE AND SEEING THE WORLD THROUGH THEIR EYES.
POD1000000010_S0000160	YOU KNOW, HEARING ABOUT COURAGE IN THAT WAY, IN THAT MOMENT REALLY SPOKE TO ME, COREY, BECAUSE I HAVE TO ADMIT THIS.
POD1000000010_S0000161	I WAS A LITTLE AFRAID TO SIT DOWN WITH SCARLETT.
POD1000000010_S0000165	ONE REALLY PRACTICAL WAY SCARLETT'S CHOOSE LOVE PLAN BUILDS COURAGE IS BY TEACHING KIDS TO STAY CALM.
POD1000000010_S0000170	JEN KOTLER AT SESAME SAYS,
POD1000000010_S0000186	YEAH, BEFORE JEN STARTED AT SESAME WORKSHOP, SHE SPENT HER DAYS IN A CLASSROOM.
POD1000000010_S0000190	THE PROBLEM JEN FOUND OUT WITH FORCED APOLOGIES IS THAT THEY'RE USUALLY PRETTY WORTHLESS.
POD1000000010_S0000193	YEAH, SO TOM LACONA AND JEN CUTLER BOTH TOLD US INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON KIDS PARROTING THE WORDS, SORRY,
POD1000000010_S0000196	JEN SAYS YOU CAN ACTUALLY TAKE A MOMENT LIKE THIS
POD1000000010_S0000200	JEN SAYS SESAME STREET HAS IMPROVED OVER TIME IN HOW IT DEPICTS APOLOGIES ON THE SHOW
POD1000000010_S0000202	SO ELMO MIGHT SAY, I WAS REALLY WANTING TO PLAY WITH MY SCOOTER AND I DIDN'T WANT TO SHARE IT.
POD1000000010_S0000206	YOU'LL GET IT, ZOE.
POD1000000010_S0000207	BUT WAIT, WHAT ABOUT YOUR TURN, ELMO?
POD1000000010_S0000208	ELMO CAN BE PATIENT AND WAIT FOR HIS TURN.
POD1000000010_S0000209	SO WHAT DO YOU SAY, ZOEY?
POD1000000010_S0000214	ALL RIGHT, NICE JOB SHARING, OLA.
POD1000000010_S0000228	YOU HURT AMY.
POD1000000010_S0000231	TOM ALSO SAYS THAT CHILDREN SHOULD LEARN TO MAKE AN APOLOGY OF ACTION.
POD1000000010_S0000236	AND SCARLETT LEWIS SAYS THAT MEANS WHEN PARENTS SCREW UP, WE NEED TO APOLOGIZE, TOO.
POD1000000010_S0000240	IF ANYTHING, SCARLETT TALKS EVEN MORE ABOUT THE OTHER SIDE OF AN APOLOGY, FORGIVENESS.
POD1000000010_S0000250	I LOVE THIS TOO, BECAUSE SCARLETT IS REALLY FOCUSING ON THE BENEFIT OF LETTING GO OF ANGER.
POD1000000010_S0000252	AND IT WAS AT THIS POINT WHERE SITTING WITH SCARLETT IN HER KITCHEN, HER BACK IS TO HER REFRIGERATOR, WHICH IS COVERED WITH PHOTOS OF JESSE AND HER OTHER SON, JT. AND WE JUST HAD TO ASK.
POD1000000010_S0000268	AJA SIMMONS HELPS RUN THE SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL PROGRAMS FOR SCHOOLS IN OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA.
POD1000000010_S0000277	TOM LACONA SAYS IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT CELEBRATING KIND ACTIONS,
POD1000000010_S0000281	YEAH, PART OF HOW SCARLETT KEEPS GOING, SHE TOLD US, IS BY CONSTANTLY REMINDING HERSELF, EVEN OUT LOUD, WHAT SHE'S GRATEFUL FOR.
POD1000000010_S0000285	AND TOM AGREES.
POD1000000010_S0000302	THAT'S A GREAT POINT, COREY. I'VE GOT TO TRY THAT.
POD1000000010_S0000306	YEAH, IN FACT, SCARLETT LEWIS SAYS,
POD1000000010_S0000308	AND SIMILARLY, TOM SAYS, KINDNESS AS A VIRTUE ISN'T RANDOM. IT'S A HABIT.
POD1000000010_S0000313	SO TOM SAYS, YOU KNOW, NOT FOR AN ALLOWANCE, BUT JUST TO GIVE THE MESSAGE THAT THIS IS WHAT WE DO TO HELP OUT BECAUSE WE'RE PART OF SOMETHING BIGGER.
POD1000000010_S0000314	AND FOR MY DAUGHTER LULU, WHO'S SEVEN, THAT CHORE REALLY IS TAKING CARE OF THE CAT.
POD1000000010_S0000322	AND HERE'S A REALLY GOOD NEWS, TOM TOLD US.
POD1000000010_S0000327	AND THAT'S WHY HE SAYS WE'RE HAPPIER WHEN WE'RE HELPING. AND JANET SESAME AGREES.
POD1000000010_S0000329	AND THAT'S WHY SCARLETT SAYS WE SHOULD TALK TO KIDS DIRECTLY ABOUT THIS HELPER'S HIGH.
POD1000000010_S0000346	TIME FOR A RECAP ON YA.
POD1000000010_S0000360	THE KIND OF COURAGE TO SEE THE WORLD THE WAY SCARLETT LEWIS DOES.
POD1000000010_S0000369	OR AS JEN AT SESAME SAYS,
POD1000000010_S0000378	AND ANYA, IT'S TIME FOR OUR GRATEFULS.
POD1000000010_S0000382	AND SPECIAL THANKS TO SCARLETT LEWIS FOR LETTING US INTO HER HOME.
POD1000000010_S0000384	THANKS ALSO TO JEN KOTLER, ROSEMARY TRULIO, AND ALL OUR FRIENDS AT SESAME WORKSHOP.

POD1000000014_S0000105	AND OF COURSE, ROB, YOU YOURSELF HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BEST PRACTICE PAPER ON PEER REVIEW AND THE WORK YOU'VE DONE IN THAT FIELD.
POD1000000014_S0000133	I'M NOT DOING IT AS PETER TYNDALL'S CITIZEN. I'M DOING IT AS OMBUDSMAN OF IRELAND BASED ON THE EVIDENCE FROM MY CASE BOOK.
POD1000000014_S0000164	IF I MAY, ROB, JUST ADD SOMETHING.
POD1000000014_S0000178	PETER, YOU CONDUCTED THE PEER REVIEW OF MY ORGANISATION AND THEN YOU APPEARED BEFORE THE SELECT COMMITTEE IN PARLIAMENT.

POD1000000017_S0000001	FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE, I'M NICOLE HANNAH JONES. THIS IS 1619.
POD1000000017_S0000003	THIS WEEK, WESLEY MORRIS ON THE BIRTH OF AMERICAN MUSIC.
POD1000000017_S0000005	SO LAST FALL, I AM AT MY FRIEND'S HOUSE. WE ARE MAKING DINNER. I'M CHOPPING VEGETABLES. AND I ASKED MY FRIEND BRETT, WHO WAS COOKING WITH ME, CAN YOU PUT ON SOME MUSIC?
POD1000000017_S0000009	AT SOME POINT, BRIGHT HAS TO GO RUN AN ERRAND. I THINK I MIGHT HAVE SENT HIM ON ONE. I DON'T REMEMBER. BUT HE'S GONE, SO I'M ALONE. JUST ME WITH THE VEGETABLES AND YODROCK.
POD1000000017_S0000019	STEAL AWAY BY ROBBY DUPREE.
POD1000000017_S0000031	I'M HEARING THINGS LIKE ROSANNA BY TOTO.
POD1000000017_S0000041	THERE IS SOMETHING JAZZ LIKE IN THE SYNCOPATED MUSIC OF SOMETHING LIKE STEELY DAN.
POD1000000017_S0000043	YOU CAN HEAR IN SOMEBODY LIKE MICHAEL MCDONALD.
POD1000000017_S0000049	AND THE SONG IN WHICH I AM HEARING IT THE DEEPEST AND STRONGEST AND MOST POWERFULLY, AT LEAST TO ME, STANDING IN THAT KITCHEN, CHOPPING THOSE VEGETABLES, WAS WHEN KENNY LOGGINS' THIS IS IT COMES ON.
POD1000000017_S0000053	KENNY LOGGINS IS BASICALLY SING WHISPERING THE VERSES OF THIS SONG.
POD1000000017_S0000058	AND THEN IN THE PRE CHORUS, KENNY LOGGINS DISAPPEARS AND WHO SHOWS UP? MICHAEL MCDONALD.
POD1000000017_S0000060	GIVING KENNY LOGGINS PLENTY OF TIME TO GATHER HIMSELF.
POD1000000017_S0000066	SCRAPING THE PAN IS THE BLACKEST THING YOU CAN DO AS A SINGER. AND HERE'S KENNY LOGGINS AS THIS WHITE ARTIST DOING IT.
POD1000000017_S0000078	I'M THINKING ABOUT AMY WINEHOUSE.
POD1000000017_S0000080	I'M THINKING ABOUT ANNIE LENNOX.
POD1000000017_S0000082	THINK ABOUT GEORGE MICHAEL.
POD1000000017_S0000084	I THINK ABOUT CHRIS STAPLETON.
POD1000000017_S0000087	AND ONE OF THE MANY PHASES IN WHICH DAVID BOWIE REALLY WANTED TO MAKE R&B AND SOUL MUSIC.
POD1000000017_S0000089	THIS IS THE SOUND NOT JUST OF BLACK AMERICA, BUT THE SOUND OF AMERICA. IT IS DEEPLY AMERICAN, ALMOST ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S SUNG BY BRITISH PEOPLE LIKE DAVID BOWIE AND ANNIE LENNOX AND AMY WINEHOUSE.
POD1000000017_S0000103	AND THEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE LIKE BILLY MCRAE.
POD1000000017_S0000114	IT'S WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE HEARD PASSING A BLACK PERSON DOING HIS JOB, ENTERTAINING HIMSELF DOING THE DRUDGERY OF WORK, THE WAY A GUY NAMED THOMAS DARTMOUTH RICE DID SOMETIME AROUND THE 1830S.
POD1000000017_S0000116	ONE DAY HE'S TOURING WITH A TROOP IN CINCINNATI, OR MAYBE IT WAS PITTSBURGH. WE DON'T REALLY KNOW. BUT THE MYTH BASICALLY GOES, T.D. RACE HAPPENED UPON AN OLD BLACK MAN CLEANING A HORSE IN A STABLE.
POD1000000017_S0000117	THE MAN WAS DOING HIS JOB ON PROPERTY OWNED BY A WHITE MAN NAMED CROW.
POD1000000017_S0000122	WHATEVER REISS HEARS COMING OUT OF THIS MAN'S MOUTH IS CAPTIVATING TO HIM. AND WHAT HE SEES IS AN OPPORTUNITY.
POD1000000017_S0000133	AND SO WHEN T.D. RICE HEARS THIS BLACK MAN SINGING THIS SONG AND MOVING HIS BODY IN THIS PARTICULAR WAY, DING, A LIGHT BULB GOES OFF.
POD1000000017_S0000140	COME LISTEN, ALL YOU GALS AND BOYS. I'M JUST FROM TUCKAHOE. I'M GOING TO SING A LITTLE SONG. MY NAME'S JIM CROW.
POD1000000017_S0000142	AND THE LYRICS GIVE THE HORSE GROOMER A NAME. AND THE NAME IS JIM CROW.
POD1000000017_S0000146	THIS IS THE FIRST TIME A PAYING AUDIENCE IS BASICALLY ELECTRIFIED BY A WHITE MAN WITH A BLACK FACE. THIS IS THE NIGHT THAT JIM CROW WAS ALLEGEDLY INTRODUCED TO AMERICA, THIS MASCOT OF AMERICAN RACISM.
POD1000000017_S0000148	AND HERE IS THOMAS DARTMOUTH RICE GIVING IT TO THEM. THIS IS THE NIGHT THAT AMERICAN POPULAR CULTURE WAS BORN.
POD1000000017_S0000151	SO YOU HAVE OTHER MINSTREL ACTS WHO COME ALONG AND TRY TO DO WHAT THOMAS DARTMOUTH RICE IS DOING, A SONG AND A DANCE.
POD1000000017_S0000175	SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE HAVING THESE DREAMS GO ON TO BECOME PEOPLE LIKE STEPHEN FOSTER.
POD1000000017_S0000177	STEPHEN FOSTER, THE MAN WIDELY CREDITED AS BEING THE FATHER OF AMERICAN MUSIC.
POD1000000017_S0000197	F.B. MILLER AND SCATMAN COROLLA.
POD1000000017_S0000210	D.W. GRIFFITH'S THE BIRTH OF A NATION, FULL OF WHITE MEN, VILLAINOUSLY IN BLACKFACE.
POD1000000017_S0000220	JUDY GARLAND PERFORMED IN BLACKFACE.
POD1000000017_S0000222	BING CROSBY AND FRED ASTAIRE BOTH PERFORMED IN BLACKFACE.
POD1000000017_S0000227	OUT OF THESE RECORDINGS, YOU HAVE PEOPLE LIKE MUDDY WATERS.
POD1000000017_S0000237	YOU HAVE THE ADVENT OF A PLACE LIKE BLUE NOTE RECORDS WHERE LOTS OF AMAZING JAZZ WAS CREATED AND THEN RELEASED INTO THE WORLD. PEOPLE LIKE SIDNEY BECHET.
POD1000000017_S0000239	RUBY ARMSTRONG.
POD1000000017_S0000241	AND DUKE ELLINGTON.
POD1000000018_S0000000	WHEN ANDY GRIFFITH PASSED AWAY IN 2012, CNN COVERED HIS DEATH OFF AND ON THE ENTIRE DAY.
POD1000000018_S0000003	LARRY KING IS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO CALLED IN TO TALK THAT DAY. HE'D HAD ANDY ON HIS VARIOUS SHOWS NUMEROUS TIMES, AND HE MENTIONED SOMETHING IN PASSING THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING.
POD1000000018_S0000005	WHAT LARRY SAID IS THAT A LAWYER NAMED PERCY FOREMAN WAS THE MAN WHO INSPIRED THE CHARACTER MATLOCK.
POD1000000018_S0000007	THIS WAS A WEIRD THING FOR ANYONE TO SAY BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE, EVEN TODAY, BELIEVE THAT CHARACTER TO BE BASED ON A DIFFERENT LAWYER NAMED BOBBY LEE COOK.
POD1000000018_S0000009	HOWEVER, IN 2015, THREE YEARS AFTER LARRY KING SAID SOMETHING THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD ASSUME WAS INCORRECT, THE CREATOR OF MATLOCK DID CONFIRM THAT THE CHARACTER WAS BASED ON PERCY FOREMAN.
POD1000000018_S0000012	PERCY WAS ABLE TO ACHIEVE THIS RECORD BY BEING AN INCREDIBLE LAWYER, NO DENYING IT, BUT ALSO DUE TO THE TEXAS COURT SYSTEM'S PRACTICE OF USING JURIES TO DETERMINE GUILT AS WELL AS SENTENCING IN THE CASE OF A GUILTY VERDICT.
POD1000000018_S0000016	PERCY HAD 12 AVERAGE CITIZENS FROM THE LOCAL COMMUNITY SITTING RIGHT THERE, WAITING TO BE CONVINCED THAT THE VICTIM IN THIS SITUATION WASN'T A VICTIM AT ALL.
POD1000000018_S0000019	FOREMAN CALLED IT MISDEMEANOR MURDER. THAT'S WHERE A JURY MIGHT CONVICT YOU OF ENDING ANOTHER PERSON'S LIFE AND SEND YOU ON YOUR WAY WITH THE TYPE OF PUNISHMENT YOU'D RECEIVE FOR A MISDEMEANOR CRIME.
POD1000000018_S0000021	PERCY FOREMAN HAD SUCH A LONG RUN OF WINS WITH THIS STRATEGY THAT IT'S STILL BEING USED IN TEXAS TODAY. PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS SORT OF THING WILL SOMETIMES REFER TO IT AS THE TEXAS DEFENSE.
POD1000000018_S0000023	NOW, JIM DENNY WASN'T FROM TEXAS. HE WAS FROM TENNESSEE.
POD1000000018_S0000025	WHEN A 16 YEAR OLD JIM DENNY GOT HIRED TO WORK THE MAILROOM OF WSM RADIO'S PARENT COMPANY, HE MUST HAVE SEEN IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF HIMSELF.
POD1000000018_S0000027	DENNY GOT THIS JOB IN 1927. THAT YEAR, THE YOUNG RADIO PROGRAM WSM BARN DANCE WAS REFERRED TO AS THE GRAND OLE OPRY FOR THE FIRST TIME ON AIR.
POD1000000018_S0000029	EVERY TIME AN ODD JOB CAME UP AT THE OPRY, JIM WOULD TAKE IT SO HE COULD HANG OUT BACKSTAGE, SEE THE ARTISTS, AND SEE HOW THE SHOW WAS MADE.
POD1000000018_S0000030	WITHIN 20 YEARS, DENNY HAD WORKED HIS WAY UP TO DIRECTOR OF THE ARTIST SERVICE BUREAU AT WSM, WHICH MEANT HE WAS IN CHARGE OF BOOKING THE ACTS ON THE OPRY.
POD1000000018_S0000032	THERE'S A FEW FUNNY THINGS FROM JIM DENNY'S TIME AT THE GRAND OLE OPRY. LIKE THE ONE ABOUT ELVIS PRESLEY'S BIG DEBUT.
POD1000000018_S0000033	ELVIS WAS STILL A TEENAGER WHEN DENNY DID SAM PHILLIPS THE FAVOR OF LETTING ELVIS COME ON THE SHOW TO PLAY HIS NOT COUNTRY ARRANGEMENT OF BLUE MOON OF KENTUCKY.
POD1000000018_S0000035	IT DIDN'T GO WELL. DENNY IS RUMORED TO HAVE TOLD ELVIS BACKSTAGE, YOU AIN'T GOING NOWHERE, SON. YOU OUGHT TO GO BACK TO DRIVING A TRUCK.
POD1000000018_S0000037	DENNY'S ALSO THE GUY WHO FIRED HANK WILLIAMS OVER THE TELEPHONE. AND THERE'S THE TIME WHEN JIM MADE JOHNNY CASH WAIT OUTSIDE HIS OFFICE FOR TWO HOURS BEFORE LETTING HIM IN TO ASK WHY CASH SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO PLAY ON THE OPRY.
POD1000000018_S0000039	CASH MENTIONED THAT HE PRESENTLY HAD A SONG CALLED I WALK THE LINE IN THE TOP 10.
POD1000000018_S0000041	JIM DENNY WAS WHAT MANY PEOPLE REFERRED TO IN THOSE TIMES AS A HARD MAN. TODAY, I THINK THEY'D HAVE SOME DIFFERENT WORDS FOR HIM. AND THAT'S WHY ERNEST TUBB TRIED TO SHOOT HIM IN 1957.
POD1000000018_S0000044	MY NAME IS TYLER MAHAN COE. I'VE HEARD THESE STORIES MY WHOLE LIFE.
POD1000000018_S0000047	IT'S SHOCKING TO HEAR ERNEST TUBBS' NAME ASSOCIATED WITH ANY KIND OF VIOLENCE WHATSOEVER.
POD1000000018_S0000051	CRISP, TEXAS IS A GHOST TOWN NOW. ERNEST TUBB WAS BORN THERE IN 1914 INTO A FAMILY OF SHARECROPPERS. LIKE MOST SHARECROPPERS' CHILDREN, ERNEST GREW UP WORKING ON FARMS ALL OVER THE AREA.
POD1000000018_S0000054	LIKE A GREAT NUMBER OF ARTISTS WE'LL LEARN ABOUT IN FUTURE EPISODES, IT WAS ALL OVER FOR A 14 YEAR OLD ERNEST TUBB THE FIRST TIME HE HEARD JIMMY ROGERS SING.
POD1000000018_S0000058	HEARING JIMMY ROGERS IS WHAT LED ERNEST TUFF TO DECIDE HE SIMPLY HAD TO BECOME A COUNTRY SINGER.
POD1000000018_S0000059	IT'S ALSO, VERY SPECIFICALLY, WHAT CAUSED HIM, THREE DECADES LATER, TO WANT TO SHOOT A .357 MAGNUM AT JIM DENNY.
POD1000000018_S0000062	THE DEATH OF HIS IDOL WAS EXTREMELY UPSETTING FOR ERNEST. HOWEVER, IT ALSO MADE HIM REALIZE THAT HE WAS GOING TO HAVE TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT CHASING HIS DREAMS.
POD1000000018_S0000067	HOLDING DOWN THREE JOBS AT ONCE WAS NECESSARY TO SUPPORT HIMSELF AND HIS YOUNG WIFE, ELAINE. THEY DIDN'T WASTE ANY TIME BEFORE STARTING TO HAVE KIDS EITHER.
POD1000000018_S0000069	ERNEST WAS MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK HARD IF IT KEPT HIM MOVING TOWARDS THE LIFE OF HIS HERO, JIMMY ROGERS.
POD1000000018_S0000070	HE'D HAD THIS SMALL PICTURE OF JIMMY FOR YEARS NOW, AND IT WAS IN PRETTY BAD SHAPE. SO HE GOT A PHONE BOOK AND LOOKED UP THE NUMBER FOR JIMMY ROGERS' WIDOW, CARRIE.
POD1000000018_S0000071	HE CALLED HER ON THE PHONE TO EXPLAIN THAT HE WAS SUCH A BIG FAN AND TO SEE IF SHE HAPPENED TO HAVE A BIGGER, BETTER PHOTO OF JIMMY THAT ERNEST COULD HAVE. MAYBE EVEN ONE THAT WAS AUTOGRAPHED.
POD1000000018_S0000072	CARRIE WAS SUPER NICE AND SHE DID HAVE SUCH A PHOTO THAT ERNEST COULD HAVE AND WENT SO FAR AS TO INVITE HIM OUT TO HER HOUSE IN CARRIVILLE, TEXAS TO GET THE PICTURE.
POD1000000018_S0000073	ERNEST DROVE OUT THERE THE NEXT SUNDAY HE WASN'T WORKING, TAKING ELAINE AND THEIR BABY JUSTIN ON THE TRIP.
POD1000000018_S0000075	THEY'D PLANNED TO STAY FOR MAYBE 10 MINUTES AND ENDED UP HANGING OUT FOR OVER TWO HOURS LOOKING AT COSTUMES, GUITARS, AND PICTURES BROUGHT OUT BY MRS. ROGERS, HEARING HER STORIES ABOUT HOW HIGH ON THE HOG THEY'D LIVED MERELY A FEW YEARS EARLIER.
POD1000000018_S0000076	E.T. COULD NEVER HAVE GUESSED WHEN HE WOKE UP THAT MORNING THAT HE'D BE LAYING DOWN TO SLEEP THAT NIGHT, HAVING HELD JIMMY ROGERS' SIGNATURE MARTIN ACOUSTIC GUITAR, WITH JIMMY'S NAME INLAID IN PEARL ACROSS THE FRETBOARD AND THE WORD THANKS WRITTEN ON THE BACK, UPSIDE DOWN,
POD1000000018_S0000080	OKAY, NOW ADD THIS ON TOP OF THAT. A FEW MONTHS LATER, KERRY ROGERS CALLED ERNEST TO SAY SHE'D LISTENED FOR HIS RADIO SHOW AS HE'D ASKED FOR HER TO DO.
POD1000000018_S0000082	ON THE OTHER HAND, SHE DIDN'T THINK HE SOUNDED LIKE JIMMY ROGERS WHEN HE SANG, WHICH IS BASICALLY THE ONLY THING IN THE WORLD ERNEST HUB WANTED TO DO IN THIS PHASE OF HIS LIFE.
POD1000000018_S0000085	ANYWAY, SHE STILL HOOKED E.T. UP WITH ELSIE MCWILLIAMS, THE WRITER OF A FEW GREAT JIMMY ROGERS SONGS.
POD1000000018_S0000086	ERNEST TUBB MADE A COUPLE OF RECORDS THAT DIDN'T SELL VERY WELL, DID SOME TOURING, AND ENDED UP BACK HOME, DOING LOW PAYING RADIO AGAIN AND WORKING TWO OR THREE SIDE JOBS LIKE BEFORE. DRIVING AROUND A BEER TRUCK WAS ONE OF THEM.
POD1000000018_S0000088	AFTER A WHILE BACK AT HOME, ERNEST HAD TO HAVE HIS TONSILS TAKEN OUT. HE'D LATER SAY THE DOCTORS TOLD HIM NOT TO SING OR YODEL FOR A WHILE AFTER THE SURGERY, BUT HE DIDN'T LISTEN.
POD1000000018_S0000093	ERNEST HELD A SELF DEPRECATING SENSE OF HUMOR ABOUT HIS OWN VOICE FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE. HE LOVED TO SAY THAT NINE OUT OF 10 GUYS SITTING IN BARS AROUND THE COUNTRY COULD SING MUCH BETTER THAN HE COULD.
POD1000000018_S0000094	I DON'T KNOW IF HE REALLY BELIEVED THAT. IT'S ALWAYS BEEN STRANGE TO ME. I THINK GEORGE JONES, INDISPUTABLY THE GREATEST COUNTRY SINGER IN HISTORY, IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ADD ERNEST TUBBS' NEW SINGING STYLE AND ROY ACUFF'S VOICE TOGETHER.
POD1000000018_S0000096	YOU JUST HEARD SOME EARNEST. HERE'S A LITTLE ROY ACUFF FROM 1942.
POD1000000018_S0000098	NOW GEORGE JONES WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU HANK WILLIAMS WAS HIS FAVORITE SINGER. YOU DON'T GET HANK WITHOUT ERNEST AND ROY. I'VE SEEN LEFTY FRIZZELL NAMED AS AN INFLUENCE ON GEORGE.
POD1000000018_S0000099	LEFTY BORROWED FROM ERNEST AS WELL. HOWEVER YOU WANT TO SAY WE GOT TO GEORGE JONES, IT ALWAYS COMES BACK TO ROY ACUFF AND ERNEST TUBB.
POD1000000018_S0000100	NOW THE PART OF EARNEST YOU CAN HEAR IN GEORGE IS THE TENDENCY TO HOLD ON TO A NOTE FOR LONGER THAN YOU'D EXPECT, PICKING THE MELODY UP AND PUTTING IT BACK DOWN IN WAYS THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT WHEN HEARING THEM SING A SONG FOR THE FIRST TIME.
POD1000000018_S0000106	IT'S POSSIBLE ERNEST REALLY DIDN'T LIKE HIS NEW VOICE. ABOUT A MILLION PEOPLE DISAGREE WITH HIS OPINION. HE HAD THAT TONSILLECTOMY IN 1939.
POD1000000018_S0000107	IN 1940, HE HAD HIS BIGGEST HIT, WALKIN' THE FLOOR OVER YOU. THIS SONG IS STILL SYNONYMOUS WITH THE NAME ERNEST TUBB.
POD1000000018_S0000108	IF SOMEONE ONLY KNOWS ONE ERNEST HUB SONG, IT'S USUALLY THIS SONG.
POD1000000018_S0000111	THE TEXAS TROUBADOUR, ERNEST TUBBS.
POD1000000018_S0000115	TUBB WOULD STAY WORKING FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE SO MEMBERS OF THE TEXAS TROUBADOURS WOULD BE REPLACED EVERY NOW AND THEN.
POD1000000018_S0000116	BUDDY EMMONS, JACK GREEN, BILLY BIRD, LEON RHODES, AND CAL SMITH ARE ONLY SOME OF THE NOTABLE PLAYERS WHO JOINED THE BAND ON THEIR WAY UP THE LADDER.
POD1000000018_S0000118	THIS WAS THE FIRST WAY ERNEST FOUND TO EXTEND A HELPING HAND TO YOUNGER MUSICIANS LIKE THE HAND KERRY ROGERS HAD HELD OUT TO HIM.
POD1000000018_S0000123	AND SO HE STARTED CALLING THEIR NAMES OUT WHEN THEY TOOK A COURSE. BUT HE WAS NEVER JEALOUS OF ANYBODY IN HIS BAND OUTSHINING HIM. HE DIDN'T MIND THAT AT ALL, AS HE PROVED WITH JACK GREEN AND CAL SMITH.
POD1000000018_S0000124	AND, OF COURSE, HE HAD THE WILBURYS WITH HIM FOR A WHILE, AND SKEETER WORKED SOME DATES WITH HIM, GEORGE JONES, STONEWALL JACKSON, AND HE WAS ALWAYS PUSHING THEM. AND HE, LIKE ROY, I THINK, UNDERSTOOD THAT THE BIGGER THEY BECAME, THE BIGGER HE BECAME.
POD1000000018_S0000125	GEORGE JONES AND STONEWALL JACKSON WERE NEVER TEXAS TROUBADOURS. JUSTIN MEANT ET TOOK THOSE GUYS OUT ON TOUR WITH HIM AS OPENING ACTS TO HELP THEM BUILD THEIR OWN FOLLOWING. AND OFTEN, HE DID A LOT MORE THAN THAT.
POD1000000018_S0000127	JOHNNY PAYCHECK.
POD1000000018_S0000129	ERNEST, ONE TIME I WAS HANGING AROUND THE STREETS AND IT WAS SNOWING AND BUDDY EMMONS TOOK ME ON TO MEET HIM. I ALWAYS WANTED TO MEET HIM.
POD1000000018_S0000131	AND EVIDENTLY, BUDDY HAD TOLD HIM THAT.
POD1000000018_S0000138	YOU CAN'T TELL THE HANK SNOW STORY WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT ERNEST TUBB. E.T. TOLD JOHNNY CASH NOT TO SMILE WHEN HE PERFORMED FOLSOM PRISON BLUES SO PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE COULD REALLY FEEL THE SONG.
POD1000000018_S0000139	CASH NEVER FORGOT THE ADVICE. HANK WILLIAMS SR. WAS HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY ERNEST'S MUSIC, AND ERNEST IS THE ONE WHO CONVINCED THE GRAND OLE OPRY TO BRING HANK BACK AFTER HIS FIRST FAILED AUDITION.
POD1000000018_S0000140	ET GOT HANK TO PROMISE HE WOULDN'T TOUCH ANY BOOZE FOR THREE MONTHS TO SWING THAT ONE.
POD1000000018_S0000141	IN 1947, ENOUGH RADIO LISTENERS WROTE LETTERS COMPLAINING OF NOT BEING ABLE TO FIND HIS MUSIC THAT HE LAUNCHED THE ERNEST TUBB RECORD SHOP IN NASHVILLE. IF YOU COULDN'T MAKE IT THERE IN PERSON, THEY'D SHIP RECORDS DIRECTLY TO YOU.
POD1000000018_S0000144	THE RECORD SHOP OPERATED AT A LOSS OF $10,000 A YEAR FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS IT WAS OPEN, BUT ERNEST KNEW HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS AND HE KEPT IT ALIVE.
POD1000000018_S0000147	ERNEST PLAYED HOST TO OPRY STARS AND NEWCOMERS ALIKE, MAKING SURE TO REMIND YOU THIS MUSIC WAS AVAILABLE FOR MAIL ORDER FROM ERNEST TUBBS' RECORD SHOP. HE TOOK THE CHANCE TO KEEP JIMMY ROGERS' MEMORY ALIVE, PITCHING HIS RECORDS AS WELL.
POD1000000018_S0000149	ERNEST NEVER GREW OUT OF HIS FASCINATION WITH JIMMY ROGERS AND NEVER STOPPED REPAYING HIS DEBT TO JIMMY'S WIDOW, CARRIE. JIMMY'S DEATH HAD LEFT CARRIE IN A PRETTY BAD FINANCIAL SITUATION, BUT SHE STILL GOT MONEY FROM THE SALES OF HIS RECORDS, WHICH WERE DECLINING.
POD1000000018_S0000150	HE REALIZED THE MORE JIMMY ROGERS RECORDS SOLD, THE BETTER OFF CARRIER WOULD BE, SO E.T. PUSHED THOSE RECORDS AS HARD AS HE COULD.
POD1000000018_S0000151	KERRY LOANED AND EVENTUALLY FLAT OUT GAVE HIM THAT GUITAR OF JIMMY'S, WHICH IS WHY YOU'LL FREQUENTLY SEE PICTURES OR VIDEOS OF ERNEST TUBB PLAYING A GUITAR THAT SAYS JIMMY ROGERS ON IT.
POD1000000018_S0000152	IN 1953, ERNEST HELPED FOUND THE JIMMY ROGERS MEMORIAL FESTIVAL IN ROGERS' HOMETOWN OF MERIDIAN, MISSISSIPPI. THAT'S A STAND UP GUY.
POD1000000018_S0000154	YOU CAN FIND PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO WILL SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT JIM DENNY.
POD1000000018_S0000155	REMEMBER JIM? POOR KID FROM TENNESSEE? WORKED HIS WAY UP FROM THE MAILROOM TO BECOME DIRECTOR OF ARTIST SERVICES AT WSM AND MANAGER OF THE GRAND OLE OPRY.
POD1000000018_S0000157	DENNY WAS A POWERFUL MAN IN NASHVILLE, AND HE ACTED LIKE HE KNEW IT.
POD1000000018_S0000158	WHERE ERNEST TUBB BUILT A REPUTATION FOR HELPING YOUNG MUSICIANS, JIM DENNY HAD A REPUTATION FOR ACTING LIKE A DICK.
POD1000000018_S0000160	THE JOHNNY CASH ET GAVE ADVICE TO IS THE SAME JOHNNY CASH WHO HAD TO WAIT TWO HOURS OUTSIDE DENNY'S OFFICE.
POD1000000018_S0000162	JIM DENNY MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN A DICK. HE COULD HAVE SIMPLY BEEN A BUSINESSMAN WHO PAID MORE ATTENTION TO THE BOTTOM LINE THAN HOW MANY FRIENDS HE HAD.
POD1000000018_S0000163	DENNY'S THE GUY WHO HAD TO BE CONVINCED TO LET HANK SR. ONTO THE OPRY. AND HE'S THE GUY WHO CALLED HANK TO FIRE HIM OVER THE TELEPHONE. BUT ERNEST TUBB WAS STANDING IN DENNY'S OFFICE WHEN THAT PHONE CALL WAS MADE.
POD1000000018_S0000164	HE SAID HE SAW TEARS IN JIM'S EYES.
POD1000000018_S0000165	HANK HAD MISSED A SCHEDULED OPRY APPEARANCE, MOST LIKELY FOR NO GOOD REASON OTHER THAN THAT HE WAS DRUNK. DENNY SAID HE THOUGHT FIRING HANK WOULD MAKE HIM REALIZE HE NEEDED TO GET HIS ACT TOGETHER.
POD1000000018_S0000166	THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED. HANK WILLIAMS DIED FOUR MONTHS AFTER BEING DISMISSED FROM THE OPRY. IT'S TRAGIC, BUT YOU CAN SEE HOW JIM DENNY THOUGHT HE WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING IN THAT SITUATION.
POD1000000018_S0000167	THIS IS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE BECAUSE THE YEAR HANK WILLIAMS DIED IS THE SAME YEAR THAT JIM DENNY FORMED CEDARWOOD PUBLISHING WITH WEBB PIERCE.
POD1000000018_S0000172	ROY ACUFF AND FRED ROSE HAD STARTED ACUFF ROSE MUSIC BACK IN 1942.
POD1000000018_S0000174	THEY WERE THE BEST GAME IN TOWN UNTIL JIM DENNY FORMED CEDARWOOD IN 53.
POD1000000018_S0000175	AS HEAD OF ARTIST SERVICES AT WSM AND MANAGER OF THE GRAND OLE OPRY, JIM DENNY CONTROLLED WHO GOT TO PLAY IN THE OPRY, THEIR PLACE IN THE LINEUP, AND HOW LONG THEY GOT TO PLAY.
POD1000000018_S0000178	IF JIM DENNY OWNS A COUNTRY MUSIC PUBLISHING FIRM WHILE RETAINING SINGULAR CONTROL OF THE MOST POPULAR COUNTRY MUSIC RADIO PROGRAM IN AMERICA, THEN HE'S ESSENTIALLY PRINTING HIS OWN MONEY.
POD1000000018_S0000181	IF THE WRITER DOESN'T WANT TO BE YOUR PERFORMER, CONGRATULATIONS! WEBB PIERCE IS THE BIGGEST STAR ON THE OPRY AND HE'S PLAYING YOUR SONG ON THE GRAND OLE OPRY TONIGHT.
POD1000000018_S0000182	ROY ACUFF WAS PISSED OFF AND HE DIDN'T STAY QUIET ABOUT IT. HE SAID DENNY WAS GIVING THE BEST SPOTS TO HIS OWN ARTISTS. ARTISTS SIGNED TO ACUFF ROSE HAD A TENDENCY TO SEE ROY'S POINT.
POD1000000018_S0000183	ARTIST SIGNED TO CEDARWOOD HAD A TENDENCY TO THINK JIM DENNY WASN'T DOING ANYTHING WRONG. WEIRD, HUH?
POD1000000018_S0000184	LONG STORY SHORT, IN 1956, WSM FIRED JIM DENNY OVER HIS CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.
POD1000000018_S0000186	HE STARTED A BOOKING AGENCY AND SIGNED MOST OF THE OPRY ARTISTS, SOME OF WHOM HAD RESIGNED WHEN DENNY WAS FIRED. THEN, DENNY CONTACTED THE PHILIP MORRIS TOBACCO COMPANY.
POD1000000018_S0000188	SO, WHEN JIM DENNY CALLED WITH A CHANCE FOR THEM TO GET THEIR PRODUCT ASSOCIATED WITH ALL THOSE ACTS, PHILIP MORRIS WROTE A CHECK BIG ENOUGH TO FUND THE BIGGEST COUNTRY MUSIC PACKAGE TOUR ANYONE HAD EVER SEEN.
POD1000000018_S0000191	IT LOOKED AS THOUGH EVERYONE WAS GETTING WHAT THEY WANTED UNTIL THE PHILIP MORRIS COUNTRY MUSIC SHOW BOOKED A STOP IN MERIDIAN, MISSISSIPPI ON THE SAME WEEK AS THE 5TH ANNUAL JIMMY ROGERS MEMORIAL FESTIVAL.
POD1000000018_S0000194	FOR FIVE YEARS, ERNEST TUBB HAD WORKED TO GROW THE JIMMY ROGERS FESTIVAL FROM SCRATCH. THIS IS A TREMENDOUSLY DIFFICULT THING TO DO. E.T. PUT IN THE EFFORT TO HONOR HIS IDOL.
POD1000000018_S0000196	JIM DENNY WASN'T SIMPLY SETTING UP SHOP ACROSS THE STREET WITH SOME HEALTHY COMPETITION.
POD1000000018_S0000197	HE BROUGHT A FREE SHOW TO TOWN ON THE SAME NIGHT WITH HALF THE GRAND OLE OPRY LINEUP AND SEVERAL BIG NAMES YOU WOULD HAVE HAD TO BUY A TICKET TO SEE ON THE JIMMY ROGERS EVENT THE PREVIOUS NIGHT.
POD1000000018_S0000199	IT WOULD CRUSH BONNAROO. THIS WAS SUCH A BIG DEAL THAT THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE JIMMY ROGERS MEMORIAL FESTIVAL THE FOLLOWING YEAR.
POD1000000018_S0000200	THEY REGROUPED TO PUT ONE ON AGAIN IN 1959, BUT KERRY ROGERS' HEALTH HAD ALREADY TAKEN A TURN FOR THE WORSE, AND ERNEST TUBB WAS NEVER INVOLVED WITH THE FESTIVAL AGAIN.
POD1000000018_S0000205	ACCORDING TO BILLY BIRD, ERNEST TUBBS' REACTION TO THE PHILIP MORRIS COUNTRY MUSIC SHOW UNDERCUTTING THE JIMMY ROGERS MEMORIAL FESTIVAL WAS TO GET DRUNK AND STAY DRUNK FOR THE BETTER PART OF A WEEK.
POD1000000018_S0000206	THEY CARTED HIM BACK TO NASHVILLE, BUT HE WAS STILL DRINKING AND HE WAS STILL MAD AS HELL AT JIM DENNY.
POD1000000018_S0000207	FINALLY, HE CALLED DENNY AT HOME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT TO CUSS HIM OUT. DENNY SAID SOMETHING LIKE, WELL, IF YOU'RE SO MAD ABOUT IT, THEN HOW ABOUT YOU JUST MEET ME DOWN AT WSM RIGHT NOW AND WE'LL SETTLE THINGS FOR GOOD.
POD1000000018_S0000209	THAT SOUNDED LIKE A GREAT PLAN TO ERNEST TUBB. HE STRAPPED ON A GUN BELT WITH BULLETS AND A .357 MAGNUM IN THE HOLSTER AND DROVE DOWNTOWN IN HIS CADILLAC WEARING HOUSE SLIPPERS.
POD1000000018_S0000210	MEANWHILE, WHEN JIM DENNY HAD HUNG UP THE PHONE, HE SIMPLY TOOK IT BACK OFF THE HOOK AGAIN SO ERNEST COULDN'T CALL HIM ANYMORE AND THEN WENT BACK TO SLEEP.
POD1000000018_S0000212	SO ERNEST TUBB IS DRUNK OFF HIS ASS WITH A LOADED GUN WHEN HE STUMBLES INTO THE LOBBY OF THE NATIONAL LIFE BUILDING WHERE WSM WAS LOCATED.
POD1000000018_S0000217	BILL WILLIAMS, THE NEWS DIRECTOR AT WSM, SAYS HE WAS WALKING INTO WORK WHEN A GUNSHOT RANG OUT IN THE LOBBY AND A BULLET WENT OVER HIS HEAD INTO THE WALL.
POD1000000018_S0000218	HE TURNED AROUND, YOU KNOW, PRETTY SCARED, AND SAW ERNEST HUB STANDING THERE IN HIS HOUSE SLIPPERS WITH A REVOLVER.
POD1000000018_S0000220	WHEN HE ASKED ERNEST WHAT THE HELL HE WAS DOING, ERNEST SAID, MY GOD, I'VE SHOT THE WRONG MAN.
POD1000000018_S0000221	WHETHER OR NOT HE'D BEEN ACTIVELY TRYING TO KILL ANYONE, WE WILL NEVER KNOW FOR CERTAIN. IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE HE THOUGHT HE HAD SUCCESSFULLY SHOT SOMEONE AND WAS ONLY UPSET THAT SOMEONE WASN'T JIM DENNY.
POD1000000018_S0000222	EITHER WAY, ERNEST SETTLED DOWN AFTER THINKING HE'D SHOT AN INNOCENT PERSON. BILL WILLIAMS CALLED HIS BOSS, JACK DEWITT, TO TELL HIM WHAT HAPPENED. JACK TOLD BILL TO TAKE ERNEST HOME.
POD1000000018_S0000225	ERNEST HUBB WENT TO JAIL FOR DRUNKEN DISORDERLY PLUS CARRYING THE WEAPON.
POD1000000018_S0000227	SO ERNEST BOUGHT CIGARETTES FOR ALL THE OTHER INMATES AND SANG SONGS WITH THEM WHILE BILL WILLIAMS WAITED TO TAKE HIM HOME.
POD1000000018_S0000231	JIM DENNY'S NAME WAS KEPT OUT OF THE PAPERS, THOUGH EVERYONE IN THE BUSINESS COULD READ BETWEEN THE LINES AND SEE WHO ERNEST HAD WANTED TO SHOOT.
POD1000000018_S0000233	THE INCIDENT SEEMS TO HAVE HAD NO EFFECT ON ERNEST TUBBS' CAREER WHATSOEVER. APPARENTLY, IF ALL E.T. WAS TRYING TO DO WAS PUT A BULLET IN JIM DENNY, THEN THAT WAS FINE.
POD1000000018_S0000236	IN 1984, HIS LUNGS KILLED HIM JUST LIKE HIS HERO, JIMMY ROGERS.
POD1000000018_S0000238	THE MIDNIGHT JAMBOREE STILL AIRS EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT, AND YOU CAN STILL BUY MUSIC FROM ERNEST HUB'S RECORD SHOP OR ONLINE AT ETRECORDSHOP.COM.
POD1000000018_S0000240	WE'RE TOLD THAT IN 1963, ERNEST HUB MADE UP WITH JIM DENNY BEFORE JIM PASSED AWAY FROM CANCER. THE JIM DENNY ARTISTS BUREAU STAYED IN BUSINESS FOR ONLY A FEW MORE YEARS.
POD1000000018_S0000242	JIM DENNY WAS INDUCTED TO THE COUNTRY MUSIC HALL OF FAME IN 1966. CEDARWOOD, JIM DENNY'S PUBLISHING COMPANY, WAS SOLD TO MEL TILLIS IN 1983.
POD1000000018_S0000243	ERNEST TUBB HAD BEEN INDUCTED TO THE COUNTRY MUSIC HALL OF FAME IN 1965 WHILE HE WAS STILL ALIVE.
POD1000000018_S0000247	BE NICE. EVERY EPISODE OF COCAINE AND RHINESTONES IS WRITTEN AND PRODUCED BY ME, TYLER MAHAN CO.
POD1000000018_S0000252	OKAY, FIRST OF ALL, IF I DIDN'T MAKE IT CLEAR, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO OVERSTATE ERNEST TUBBS' IMPORTANCE TO COUNTRY MUSIC.
POD1000000018_S0000254	IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT HONKY TONK, AND IT HAPPENED AFTER ERNEST TUBB, IT WAS INFLUENCED BY ERNEST TUBB. BEFORE I GET TO THE STORY IN THE EPISODE, I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS ONE OTHER THING.
POD1000000018_S0000255	IN THE 1980S, CLYDE MOODY TRIED TO START AN ALTERNATIVE ASSOCIATION TO THE COUNTRY MUSIC HALL OF FAME CALLED THE COUNTRY MUSIC PIONEER ASSOCIATION.
POD1000000018_S0000256	THE CMPA HAD A TRASHY NEWSPAPER THAT CLYDE ESSENTIALLY USED TO RANT AGAINST THE INDUSTRY AND PRINT WHATEVER SHITTY RUMORS PEOPLE SENT IN.
POD1000000018_S0000257	AMONG THESE RUMORS WAS ONE THAT ERNEST TUBB DIED BROKE AND ALONE IN A CHEAP DOWNTOWN MOTEL. SHUNNED BY THE COUNTRY MUSIC WORLD, HE'D DONE SO MUCH TO HELP.
POD1000000018_S0000259	CHARLIE LUVIN EVEN HAS IT IN HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY, WHICH ISN'T THE ONLY THING CHARLIE GOT WRONG IN THAT BOOK, BUT I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT ANOTHER TIME.
POD1000000018_S0000260	FIRST OF ALL, THE SOURCE WAS ERNEST TUBB'S ESTRANGED WIFE. NEXT, ERNEST DIED OWNING 70% OF THE ERNEST TUBB RECORD SHOP, WHICH HAD MULTIPLE LOCATIONS RUNNING AND WAS VERY PROFITABLE AT THAT TIME. HE WAS NOT A BROKE MAN.
POD1000000018_S0000262	I BELIEVE ERNEST CHOSE TO TURN VISITORS AWAY BECAUSE HE WAS WASTING AWAY OF EMPHYSEMA AND DIDN'T WANT ANYONE WHO LOVED HIM TO HAVE THAT AS THEIR LAST MEMORY OF HIM.
POD1000000018_S0000265	AND I THINK JUSTIN SAID THAT PEOPLE WOULD GO, WOULD TRY TO SEE ERNEST AND HE WOULD TELL JUSTIN TO TELL THEM, THANK YOU, BUT HE'D RATHER NOT HAVE THE COMPANY.
POD1000000018_S0000266	SO, YOU KNOW, I MEAN, THE END. I DON'T THINK THAT ERNEST HUB DIED, YOU KNOW, IN A SAD STATE OF AFFAIRS. I THINK THAT HE DID WELL.
POD1000000018_S0000268	I THINK HE DID A LOT FOR COUNTRY MUSIC, AND I THINK HE WENT OUT THE WAY THAT HE WANTED TO GO, IT SEEMS LIKE TO ME. OKAY, BACK TO ERNEST HUB AND JIM DENNY.
POD1000000018_S0000269	WHAT ABOUT THIS STORY? WAS THAT CRAZY? IT'S JUST SO MANY THINGS. THE ROOTS OF COUNTRY MUSIC ARE JUST GROWING ALL OVER THIS STORY. YOU GOT JIM DENNY SHOWING UP RIGHT AS THE GRAND OLE OPRY IS BECOMING A THING.
POD1000000018_S0000270	ERNEST HUB GETS IN THERE AND HIS THROAT IS BROKEN SO HE CAN'T DO WHAT HE WANTED TO DO HIS WHOLE LIFE, WHICH IS IMITATE HIS HERO.
POD1000000018_S0000271	AND THEN HIS THROAT GETS BROKEN. AND SO NOW HE'S GOT TO CREATE THIS NEW THING. AND HE ENDS UP INFLUENCING FUCKING HANK WILLIAMS, SR. AND LIKE EVERYONE THAT IS THAT'S CRAZY. IT'S AMAZING. I LOVE THIS STORY.
POD1000000018_S0000273	AT LEAST THE PART ABOUT ERNEST HUB GETTING DRUNK AND GOING DOWN TO THE RADIO STATION WITH A GUN AND SHOOTING AND FIRING OFF AROUND INTO THE WALL, YOU KNOW,
POD1000000018_S0000274	PEOPLE ALWAYS BRING THAT UP AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW WILD AND CRAZY THESE OLD GUYS WERE. EVERYBODY LAUGHS ABOUT ERNEST GETTING HAULED OFF TO JAIL AND ULTIMATELY GETTING AWAY WITH CAUSING A LITTLE BIT OF TROUBLE, YOU KNOW, BOYS WILL BE BOYS.
POD1000000018_S0000276	THANKS TO RONNIE PUGH'S VERY WELL DONE BIOGRAPHY ON ERNEST HUB. THAT FINALLY HAD THE STORY FOR ME. AND THE BIG JIMMY ROGERS FESTIVAL THING, WHY THAT AFFECTED ERNEST SO DEEPLY, THAT WAS IN THERE.
POD1000000018_S0000277	THE MOST DETAILED ACCOUNT OF BILL WILLIAMS VERSION OF THE LOBBY SHOOTING WAS IN THERE.
POD1000000018_S0000278	I WENT WITH BILL'S VERSION BECAUSE A, HE WAS THE NEWS DIRECTOR OF WSM WITH A REPUTATION FOR BEING ABLE TO THROW AWAY THAT DAY'S NEWS SCRIPT AND AD LIB THE NEWS WITHOUT MAKING A MISTAKE.
POD1000000018_S0000279	AND B, HE WAS THE ONE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT. YOU KNOW, HE CALLED HIS BOSS AT HOME. HE WENT WITH ERNEST TO THE JAIL. SHOUT OUT, JIM FARNEY. EVERYONE ELSE JUST SEEMED LIKE A BYSTANDER TRYING TO GET THEIR NAME INVOLVED, YOU KNOW.
POD1000000018_S0000280	LIKE A SECURITY GUARD SAYING THAT HE TOLD ERNEST TO PUT THE GUN AWAY AND ERNEST FIRED IT OFF TO DARE THE SECURITY GUARD OR WHATEVER. YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
POD1000000018_S0000282	ALSO, I'M AWARE THERE ARE DIFFERENT REVISIONIST HISTORY TYPE OPINIONS ABOUT HOW WELL ELVIS PRESLEY'S DEBUT ON THE GRAND OLE OPRY DID OR DIDN'T GO.
POD1000000018_S0000285	I'VE SEEN EVERY YEAR FROM 1924 TO 1929 CITED AS THE YEAR OF DENNY BEING HIRED AT THE PARENT COMPANY OF WSM, THE INSURANCE COMPANY, THE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY. I DON'T REALLY CARE WHAT YEAR HE, YOU KNOW, EXACTLY WAS. LET'S SEE.
POD1000000018_S0000286	THERE WAS A BIOGRAPHY OF JOHNNY CASH THAT QUOTED A ROLLING STONE INTERVIEW WITH JOHNNY TALKING ABOUT JIM DENNY MAKING HIM WAIT OUTSIDE HIS OFFICE FOR TWO HOURS.
POD1000000018_S0000287	LARRY JORDAN'S BIOGRAPHY ON JIM REEVES HAD A BUNCH OF GREAT INFORMATION ON THE JIM DENNY OPRY SCANDAL. I FOUND A BILLBOARD MAGAZINE FROM 1956 REPORTING THAT PHILIP MORRIS PAID OVER $400,000 FOR THE TALENT ON THAT FIRST PACKAGE TOUR.
POD1000000018_S0000291	I'M GOING TO SAY THIS GUY'S LAST NAME WRONG. CRAIG HAVIGHURST. I DON'T KNOW. HE WROTE A BOOK ON THE HISTORY OF WSM CALLED...
POD1000000018_S0000294	I KNOW I'M GOING TO KEEP COMING BACK TO THIS BOOK FOR FUTURE EPISODES. A LOT OF WHAT I GOT OUT OF THAT FOR THIS WAS ABOUT DENNY'S FIRING BECAUSE PRETTY MUCH EVERYWHERE ELSE YOU HEAR PEOPLE TALK ABOUT DENNY GETTING FIRED,
POD1000000018_S0000295	THEY'RE ALL LIKE, YEAH, I DON'T KNOW. IT WAS JUST LIKE WEIRD. NO ONE REALLY KNOWS WHY HE GOT FIRED. OR YOU'VE GOT ARTISTS WHO WERE WITH CEDARWOOD SAYING JIM DENNY GOT RAILROADED.
POD1000000018_S0000296	YOU'VE GOT ARTISTS WHO WERE WITH ACUFF ROSE SAYING DANNY WAS CORRUPT AND HE HAD TO GET OUT OF THERE, YOU KNOW? SO THIS WSM BOOK WAS REALLY GOOD JUST TO FIND OUT STRAIGHT UP WHAT HAPPENED.
POD1000000018_S0000298	I MENTIONED THAT HANK SR. WAS HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY ERNEST TUBB, BUT ALSO SOME OF THE MOST CHARMING STUFF I'VE EVER READ ABOUT HANK IS THE WAY HE ACTED AROUND ERNEST.
POD1000000018_S0000299	YOU KNOW, THEY WERE PEERS, THEY WERE CONTEMPORARIES. HANK WAS INFLUENCED BY HIM, BUT THEN HE, YOU KNOW, GOT TO COME TO THE SHOW.
POD1000000018_S0000300	AND BE A PART OF THE BIG TIME. AND YOU JUST GET THE IDEA THAT HE WAS JUST LIKE A KID IN A CANDY STORE AROUND ERNEST TUBB. YOU GET THE IDEA THAT HE JUST REALLY LOVED BEING AROUND THIS GUY AND HE COULDN'T HELP MESSING WITH HIM. HE WAS ALWAYS SCREWING WITH ERNEST.
POD1000000018_S0000301	ERNEST HUB SONG WALKING THE FLOOR OVER YOU HANK WILLIAMS TOOK THAT IMAGE OF WALKING THE FLOOR AND PUT IT IN YOUR CHEATING HEART YOU KNOW YOU'LL WALK THE FLOOR LIKE I DO
POD1000000018_S0000302	AND HE HAD A MONSTER HIT WITH IT. AND HE JUST COULDN'T LEAVE ERNEST ALONE ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW, JUST LIKE, HEY, ERNEST, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? I STOLE THAT IMAGE FROM YOU. I GOT YOUR IMAGE, BOY. LIKE JUST THAT KIND OF SHIT.
POD1000000018_S0000303	THAT CLIP OF JUSTIN TUBB TALKING AND THE CLIP OF JOHNNY PAYCHECK TALKING ARE BOTH FROM THE COUNTRY FAMILY REUNION DVDS, WHICH ARE PRETTY MUCH ALL AMAZING IF YOU'VE NEVER SEEN THOSE.
POD1000000018_S0000304	I THINK IT'S BILL ANDERSON THAT HOSTS THEM. THERE'S GOTTA BE 20 OF THEM IN A SERIES. THEY'VE ALWAYS GOT DIFFERENT OLD SCHOOL PEOPLE ON THERE SITTING AROUND TALKING, TELLING STORIES.
POD1000000018_S0000305	JUST, I MEAN, IF YOU SEE ONE, ANY OF THE ONES WITH GRANDPA JONES, ANY OF THE ONES WITH GRANDPA JONES OR LITTLE JIMMY DICKENS ON THEM ARE FUCKING HILARIOUS. YOU'VE GOT TO SEE THEM JUST...
POD1000000018_S0000309	THERE'S A BOOK CALLED ANDY AND DAWN WITH THE CONFIRMATION OF PERCY FOREMAN INSPIRING MATLOCK.
POD1000000018_S0000310	PERCY IS NO LONGER ALIVE AND HIS NEW YORK TIMES OBITUARY HAD SOME OTHER INTERESTING INFORMATION THAT I DID NOT KNOW.
POD1000000018_S0000311	LIKE JACK RUBY ASKED PERCY FOREMAN TO DEFEND HIM AFTER SHOOTING LEE HARVEY OSWALD. BUT THEN THERE WAS THIS COMMUNICATION ERROR, LIKE, UH,
POD1000000018_S0000312	JACK RUBY'S PEOPLE TOLD JACK THAT FOREMAN WANTED LIKE FIVE TIMES AS MUCH MONEY AS HE EVER ASKED FROM ANYONE OR SOMETHING. SO HE WAS LIKE, WELL, SCREW THAT. I'LL GO SOMEONE ELSE.
POD1000000018_S0000313	AND FOREMAN SEEMED DISAPPOINTED THAT HE DIDN'T GET THAT CASE. SO I GUESS HE WANTED THAT. BUT FOREMAN DID REPRESENT MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.'S ASSASSIN, JAMES EARL RAY.
POD1000000018_S0000314	BUT ONLY LONG ENOUGH TO CONVINCE HIM TO PLEAD GUILTY. SO YEAH, JAMES DID NOT GET AWAY WITH THAT. UH,
POD1000000018_S0000321	IT WAS ONLY AFTER UNCOVERING THE PERCY FOREMAN MATLOCK CONNECTION THAT I LEARNED THAT IT WAS REALLY JUST A LEGAL DEFENSE STRATEGY THAT WORKS SO INCREDIBLY WELL THERE, IT MAY AS WELL BE A LAW.
POD1000000018_S0000326	THEN NEXT WEEK I'M GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT LORETTA LYNN'S SONG, THE PILL. IT'S ABOUT THE BIRTH CONTROL PILL AND IT WAS BANNED FROM RADIO. AND I WAS LOOKING INTO WHY AND I FOUND OUT A LOT OF REALLY, REALLY INTERESTING STUFF. YOU KNOW, THINGS...
POD1000000018_S0000328	IT'S CRAZY. IT'S REALLY CRAZY. DEFINITELY COME BACK NEXT WEEK. LORETTA LYNN, THE PILL.
POD1000000022_S0000000	HELLO EVERYONE, I'M STEPHEN WEST. THIS IS PHILOSOPHIZE THIS. THANK YOU TO EVERYONE THAT SUPPORTS THE SHOW ON PATREON. AND THANK YOU TO THE PEOPLE THAT DON'T SUPPORT THE SHOW BY GOING THROUGH THE AMAZON BANNER. YOU CAN FIND OUT MORE ABOUT BOTH THOSE THINGS ON THE FRONT PAGE OF PHILOSOPHIZETHIS.ORG.
POD1000000022_S0000001	APOLOGIES FOR THE VOICE AND MY LACK OF EXECUTION TODAY. I'M JUST GETTING OVER A COLD. BUT IT HAD BEEN TOO LONG SINCE I HAD GRACED YOU WITH MY VOICE. AND I WANTED TO GIVE YOU GUYS THIS. TODAY'S EPISODE IS PART SIX IN A SERIES ON SARTRE AND CAMUS. I HOPE YOU LOVE THE SHOW TODAY.
POD1000000022_S0000004	MAYBE YOU DON'T SIT AROUND POISED WAITING TO MAKE OTHER PEOPLE AWARE OF SOME BAD THING THAT HAPPENED TO YOU IN THE PAST. WELL, ENOUGH OF THAT CRAZY TALK. GET OFF THE BENCH BECAUSE YOUR UNCLE STEVE'S PUTTING YOU IN THE GAME. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, DON'T WORRY, MY FRIEND. YOU ARE A VICTIM. YOU REALLY ARE.
POD1000000022_S0000012	AND AT THE TIME OF SARTRE, FOR OVER 300 YEARS, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN POINTING OUT HOW MANY OF THE WAYS WE LOOK AT THINGS IN THE WESTERN WORLD ARE LARGELY DERIVATIVE FROM THE WAY CHRISTIANITY DESCRIBES BEING A HUMAN BEING.
POD1000000022_S0000023	THAT A REASONABLE EXPECTATION TO HAVE WHEN NAVIGATING YOUR LIFE IS THAT ONE DAY YOU'RE GOING TO WAKE UP AND THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME EVENT, SOME MIRACLE THAT YOU WITNESS, SOME TRANSCENDENT MOMENT WHERE YOU REALIZE THE DIVINITY OF JESUS.
POD1000000022_S0000030	MAYBE FOR SOME OF YOU OUT THERE, THERE'S ONLY ONE OTHER PERSON IN THIS ENTIRE WORLD THAT HAS FULL ACCESS TO YOUR TRUE SELF HIDDEN DEEP WITHIN YOU. BUT SARTRE WOULD SAY, IS THIS REALLY HOW THE SELF WORKS?
POD1000000022_S0000031	IS THE SELF REALLY LIKE THE CHRISTIAN SOUL HIDDEN SOMEWHERE DEEP WITHIN YOU THAT ONLY YOU HAVE ACCESS TO? SARTRE WOULD SAY, IT VERY WELL MAY BE THAT YOU PUT ON A MASK WHEN YOU GO OUT IN PUBLIC FOR THE SAKE OF PRAGMATISM. AND IT VERY WELL MAY BE THAT YOU'VE REFLECTED ON YOURSELF.
POD1000000022_S0000033	THIS CONCEPT IS A COMMON ONE IN EXISTENTIALISM. IT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF THE MAIN THEMES IN DOSTOEVSKY'S BOOK CRIME AND PUNISHMENTS. THE IDEA THAT, YOU KNOW, WE OFTEN THINK WE KNOW A LOT MORE ABOUT OURSELVES THAN WE ACTUALLY DO IN PRACTICE. TWO EXAMPLES OF THIS.
POD1000000022_S0000036	THAT GUY NOW THIS MAN BELIEVES BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT THAT HE IS NAPOLEON IF YOU SAT HIM DOWN AND YOU ASK HIM CANDIDLY NO BUT WHO ARE YOU REALLY DEEP DOWN INSIDE HE WOULD SAY I'M NAPOLEON BONAPARTE COMMANDER THE ARMIES OF THE NORTH
POD1000000022_S0000037	HUSBAND TO A MURDERED WIFE, FATHER TO A MURDERED SON, AND I WILL HAVE MY VENGEANCE. BUT IS THIS MAN REALLY NAPOLEON? WE KNOW HE'S NOT NAPOLEON. IN FACT, IN A WEIRD WAY, AS OUTSIDERS, WE SEEM TO HAVE AN ADVANTAGE WHEN IT COMES TO KNOWING WHO HE REALLY IS.
POD1000000022_S0000040	I'M GOING TO THE SPORTING GOODS SECTION. I MEAN, I'M GOING TO GO UP INTO THE RAFTERS LIKE I'M TOM CRUISE AND SNAP THE DUDE'S NECK. I'M GOING TO DO THIS BECAUSE THAT'S JUST THE KIND OF PERSON I AM. THAT'S ME. I'D SACRIFICE MY LIFE FOR THE GREATER GOOD. NOW, HE MAY TELL HIS FRIENDS THIS.
POD1000000022_S0000044	SARTRE SAYS THAT WHEN YOU TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THE SELF, IT'S NOT A SOUL. IT'S NOT A PERSONALITY HIDDEN DEEP WITHIN YOU. WHAT WE'RE REFERENCING WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE SELF TURNS OUT TO BE MUCH MORE COMPLEX THAN THAT WITH MANY MORE MOVING PARTS.
POD1000000022_S0000045	AND I THINK A GOOD PLACE TO BEGIN IF WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND SARTRE'S VIEWS ON WHAT THE SELF REALLY IS, IS TO TALK ABOUT TWO FOUNDATIONAL ASPECTS OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A HUMAN BEING THAT TO SARTRE SEEM TO BE CONSTANTLY INTERTWINED AND DEPENDENT UPON EACH OTHER. WHAT HE CALLS OUR FACTICITY,
POD1000000022_S0000048	FULLY AFFIRMATIVE AND BEING FOR ITSELF AS BEING CONSCIOUSNESS OR THE SOURCE OF ALL NEGATION? WELL, ONE DAY WHEN SARTRE WAS TRYING TO MEET HIS MONTHLY QUOTA FOR OBSCURE SOUNDING PHILOSOPHICAL DESCRIPTIONS, THE WAY HE DESCRIBES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO ONTOLOGICAL CATEGORIES IS THAT BEING IN ITSELF, QUOTE,
POD1000000022_S0000049	QUOTE, IS WHAT IT IS, AND BEING FOR ITSELF, QUOTE, IS WHAT IT IS NOT. WELL, AS WEIRD AS THAT SOUNDS IN A VACUUM, AFTER LISTENING TO LAST EPISODE, WE ALL KNOW WHAT HE MEANS WHEN HE SAYS IT. BUT THEN SARTRE POINTS OUT SOMETHING VERY MYSTERIOUS, A VERY STRANGE COINCIDENCE.
POD1000000022_S0000050	WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO ONTOLOGICAL CATEGORIES, TWO THINGS THAT ARE EASY TO WRITE OFF AS JUST THESE MEANINGLESS ABSTRACT CONCEPTS THAT START TO COOK UP ONE DAY, WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW BEING IN ITSELF AND BEING FOR ITSELF RELATE TO EACH OTHER,
POD1000000022_S0000051	SARTRE NOTICES THERE SEEMS TO BE A SIMILAR SORT OF RELATIONSHIP AT THE FOUNDATION OF WHO WE ARE AS PEOPLE. SEE, BECAUSE ON ONE HAND, ALL OF US HAVE OUR FACTICITY. AND FACTICITY IS KIND OF LIKE BEING IN ITSELF. IT'S THE FULLY AFFIRMATIVE SET OF FACTS THAT ARE TRUE ABOUT US.
POD1000000022_S0000053	I'M SCARED OF SPIDERS THINGS LIKE THAT RIGHT IN OTHER WORDS STATEMENTS OF FACTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY TRUE ABOUT US THAT'S WHAT MAKES UP OUR FACTICITY BUT WHAT SARTRE WOULD WANT US TO CONSIDER IS THAT WHILE THESE KINDS OF STATEMENTS ARE NO DOUBT USEFUL WHEN IT COMES TO DESCRIBING CERTAIN PIECES OF WHO I AM AND
POD1000000022_S0000058	YOU CAN START TO HEAR THE WEIRD STAR TREK DESCRIPTION CREEPING IN THERE. JUST LIKE BEING IN ITSELF IS WHAT IT IS AND BEING FOR ITSELF IS WHAT IT IS NOT. IN A SENSE, I AM WHAT I AM. I HAVE A FACTICITY. BUT I ALSO AM WHAT I AM NOT YET.
POD1000000022_S0000066	WHEN SARTRE TALKS ABOUT RADICAL FREEDOM, WHEN ANY OF US TALK ABOUT BEING INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE FREE TO ACT AS THEY CHOOSE, WE'RE NEVER TALKING ABOUT TOTAL FREEDOM, RIGHT? IT'S ALWAYS FREEDOM WITHIN CERTAIN LIMITATIONS.
POD1000000022_S0000072	BUT YEAH, ULTIMATELY THE POINT SARTRE'S MAKING HERE WITH THE CONCEPTS OF FACTICITY AND TRANSCENDENCE IS NOT ONLY TO STOP THINKING ABOUT YOURSELF AS THOUGH IT'S THIS ARTIFACT HIDDEN DEEP WITHIN YOU INSIDE OF A VAULT, BUT ALSO STOP THINKING ABOUT WHO YOU ARE AS THOUGH IT'S THIS STATIC
POD1000000022_S0000075	UNLESS IF YOU'RE DEAD, YOU'VE NEVER ARRIVED AT A DESTINATION AS A HUMAN BEING. NOW AT FIRST GLANCE, THIS MAY SEEM LIKE SARTRE'S WRITING A SELF HELP BOOK. NO, NO SINGLE FACT ABOUT YOU SUMS UP WHO YOU ARE. RELEASE YOUR INNER TRANSCENDENCE. NO.
POD1000000022_S0000076	NO, LIKE WE TOUCHED ON LAST TIME, SARTRE THINKS THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE TRULY FACED WITH THE NUMBER OF THESE POSSIBILITIES THEY'RE FREE TO CHOOSE FROM, MOST OF THE TIME THEY DON'T GET EXCITED. THEY'RE HORRIFIED BY IT. IN FACT, MOST OF THE TIME, ONCE PEOPLE REALIZE THIS STUFF, THEY'RE GOING TO BE LIKE,
POD1000000022_S0000077	SARTRE THINKS THAT THE SECRET, COVERT DESIRE OF EVERYONE, WHETHER THEY REALIZE IT OR NOT, IS TO ESCAPE THIS DUALITY. IT'S TO TURN THEMSELVES INTO EITHER PURE FACTICITY OR PURE TRANSCENDENCE. OR AS SARTRE SAYS, WE ALL SECRETLY WANT TO BECOME GOD.
POD1000000022_S0000080	GOD IS PERFECT AS HE IS, PURE FACTICITY. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, GOD IS ALL POWERFUL AND CAPABLE OF BRINGING ABOUT ANY POSSIBILITY HE WANTS. IN OTHER WORDS, PURE TRANSCENDENCE. SARTRE WOULD SAY THIS IS NO COINCIDENCE.
POD1000000022_S0000083	OR PURE TRANSCENDENCE LIKE GOD, IS WHAT SARTRE CALLS BAD FAITH. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE MOST FAMOUS EXAMPLE OF BAD FAITH THAT SARTRE LAYS OUT. AND BECAUSE WE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT IT IN THE OTHER EPISODE, I'LL KEEP IT BRIEF.
POD1000000022_S0000084	SARTRE TALKS ABOUT SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF A CAFE IN PARIS, WATCHING A WAITER AS HE DOES HIS JOB. NOW, YOU CAN IMAGINE A WAITER IN THE 1940S, RIGHT? DRESSED UP IN HIS LITTLE OUTFIT, VERY UPRIGHT, GOOD POSTURE, VERY PROPER.
POD1000000022_S0000085	HE HOLDS THE TRAY IN A PARTICULAR WAY. HE WALKS AND CHANGES DIRECTION IN A VERY MILITARISTIC, PARTICULAR WAY, LIKE A GOOD WAITER DOES. SARTRE CAN'T HELP BUT POINT OUT THAT THIS GUY DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A SELF WITH FACTICITY AND TRANSCENDENCE IN THIS MOMENT.
POD1000000022_S0000087	GO TO MOST RESTAURANTS AND YOU CAN FIND SOME MODERN VERSION OF WHAT SARTRE'S TALKING ABOUT HERE. I MEAN, THERE'S SO MANY SERVERS OUT THERE THAT HAVE FALLEN INTO BAD FAITH AND ARE JUST SORT OF PLAYING THE ROLE OF THE SAME PERSON. IT SEEMS TO BE A MODERN ARCHETYPE OF WHAT IT IS TO BE A SERVER. THEY ALL SAY THE SAME STUFF.
POD1000000022_S0000088	HI, I'M JOHN. I'M GOING TO BE TAKING CARE OF YOU TODAY. CAN I GET YOU GUYS STARTED WITH A BOTTOMLESS BUCKET OF SHRIMP OR SOME DRINKS OR SOMETHING? BUT IT'S AT EVERY STAGE OF THE MEAL. HOW'S EVERYTHING TASTED FOR YOU GUYS? Y'ALL SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT? NOW, THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO RUSH. I'M GOING TO LEAVE THE CHECK HERE. I'M GOING TO GO OVER THERE.
POD1000000022_S0000090	ASK YOURSELF, IS THIS THE WAY THIS GUY TALKS TO HIS MOM? IS THIS THE WAY HE TALKS TO HIS BEST FRIENDS? NO. HE'S FALLEN INTO BAD FAITH AND IS JUST PLAYING THE PART OF A SERVER. NOW THE POINT SARTRE'S MAKING IS NOT THAT WAITERS NEED TO BE MORE CREATIVE. IT'S NOT ABOUT WAITERS.
POD1000000022_S0000091	SARTRE THINKS THAT AS HUMAN BEINGS, WE HAVE A TENDENCY TO GRAVITATE TOWARDS THIS TRAP IN ALL ASPECTS OF OUR LIFE. WE MAKE PROCLAMATIONS ABOUT WHAT WE ARE ALL THE TIME. I AM A STAY AT HOME MOM. THAT'S MY IDENTITY.
POD1000000022_S0000094	AND WE USE BAD FAITH TO QUELL THIS FEELING OF NAUSEA. WE'RE CONSTANTLY DOING THIS WITH OURSELVES. NOW, IF ALL YOU EVER READ WAS SARTRE'S BEING AND NOTHINGNESS, YOU MIGHT GET THE READ FROM THE BOOK THAT THIS TENDENCY WE HAVE TO GRAVITATE TOWARDS BAD FAITH IS
POD1000000022_S0000096	BUT IN ONE OF THE FOOTNOTES OF BEING AND NOTHINGNESS, SARTRE ALLUDES TO A WAY OUT OF ALL OF IT, AND PERHAPS TO AN ETHICS THAT HE'D WRITE LATER ON IN HIS LIFE. WELL, HE NEVER WRITES AN ETHICS, AND IT MAY BE BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, HIS LIFELONG PARTNER.
POD1000000022_S0000097	AND FELLOW EXISTENTIALIST SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR PRODUCES WHAT MANY CONSIDER TO BE THE GREATEST EXISTENTIALIST APPROACH TO ETHICS CALLED THE ETHICS OF AMBIGUITY. NEXT EPISODE IS PART TWO ON SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR, SO WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ALL ABOUT IT. BUT ENOUGH OF BAD FAITH. LET'S GET BACK TO ANSWERING THIS QUESTION, WHO AM I?
POD1000000022_S0000100	SARTRE WOULD SAY, YOU DON'T HAVE SOME PRIVILEGED VIP ACCESS TO THE FACTS THAT ARE TRUE ABOUT YOU AND THE POSSIBILITIES THAT YOU HAVE. I MEAN, HYPOTHETICALLY, ANY OTHER PERSON, IF THEY WERE DILIGENT ENOUGH, HAS ACCESS TO YOUR FACTICITY AND TRANSCENDENCE.
POD1000000022_S0000101	IN FACT, JUST LIKE THE GUY THAT TELLS HIMSELF THAT HE'S NAPOLEON, SOMETIMES OTHER PEOPLE ARE BETTER AT TELLING US WHO WE ARE THAN WE ARE. BUT HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE? THE REASON IT'S POSSIBLE IS BECAUSE THE SELF IS NOT THE CHRISTIAN SOUL, DESARTRE.
POD1000000022_S0000104	NO, WE TELL OURSELVES STORIES ALL THE TIME. WHAT FOLLOWS FROM THIS IS THAT THE TRUE MEASURE OF YOUR VALUES, THE TRUE MEASURE OF WHO YOU ARE, IS WHAT YOU ACTUALLY DO. IT'S THE COLLECTION OF WHAT YOU'VE ACTUALLY DONE THUS FAR IN YOUR LIFE. AND SARTRE SAYS THAT WHEN YOU STOP LOOKING AT THE SELF.
POD1000000022_S0000107	NOTHINGNESS THAT SARTRE LAYS OUT HIS THIRD ONTOLOGICAL CATEGORY, WHAT HE CALLS BEING FOR OTHERS. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT HE MEANS. SARTRE WOULD SAY THAT AN INTRINSIC PART OF WHAT IT IS TO BE YOU IS EXISTING ALONGSIDE OTHER PEOPLE AND ALL THE CONSEQUENCES THAT COME ALONG WITH THAT.
POD1000000022_S0000108	THIS IS SARTRE'S CONCEPT OF BEING FOR OTHERS. NOW, HOW DOES BEING FOR OTHERS AFFECT MY ANSWER TO THE QUESTION, WHO AM I? WELL, AGAIN, THIS CONCEPT OF THE SELF IS OUTSIDE OF US. IT'S AN ABSTRACTION.
POD1000000022_S0000109	AND WHAT SARTRE POINTS OUT IS THAT THERE ARE MANY ASPECTS ABOUT WHO WE ARE THAT ARE GIVEN TO US BY OTHER PEOPLE. FOR EXAMPLE, WHETHER WE'RE TRUSTWORTHY OR NOT. WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE A TRUSTWORTHY PERSON IS AN ASPECT OF WHO YOU ARE THAT'S MEDIATED BY OTHER PEOPLE, RIGHT?
POD1000000022_S0000111	AND HOW OTHER PEOPLE VIEW US SEEM TO BE CONNECTED TO SARTRE. BUT THE FLIP SIDE OF IT BEING THAT INTERCONNECTED IS THAT IT LEAVES US IN WHAT HE DESCRIBES AS A PERPETUAL STATE OF BEING JUDGED BY THE PEOPLE AROUND US.
POD1000000022_S0000114	YOU WILL HENCEFORTH BE KNOWN AS THE WEIRD SHOES GUY IN THAT PERSON'S MIND. THIS IS CONSTANTLY GOING ON. BUT SARTRE'S NOT SAYING IT'S ALWAYS BAD, THAT BEING AROUND OTHER PEOPLE IS SOME PARANOID, EVERYBODY'S THINKING BAD THINGS ABOUT ME ALL THE TIME THING.
POD1000000022_S0000115	PEOPLE VERY WELL MAY BE THINKING REALLY GOOD THINGS ABOUT YOU ALL THE TIME. THE POINT THAT SARTRE WANTS TO MAKE IS THAT THIS WHOLE DYNAMIC, THIS DYNAMIC OF OTHER PEOPLE SEEING YOU, PUTTING YOU ON TRIAL, AND TURNING YOU INTO PURE FACTICITY IN THEIR MINDS, THIS IS GOING ON ALL THE TIME.
POD1000000022_S0000121	IT MAY SEEM TO US LIKE WE HAVE A SORT OF SPECIAL ACCESS TO KNOWING WHO WE ARE AND THAT WE CHOOSE TO SHARE OURSELVES WITH ONLY OUR CLOSEST FRIENDS WHO WE TRUST DEARLY. BUT SARTRE WOULD SAY THAT THE REASON IT SEEMS THAT WAY IS BECAUSE WHAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE IS A NARRATIVE ABOUT YOURSELF
POD1000000022_S0000124	IS BECAUSE THAT'S THE VERY CRITERIA WE ALL USE TO CHOOSE WHO OUR FRIENDS ARE GOING TO BE, IS WHETHER OR NOT THEY REINFORCE THIS PICTURE THAT WE HAVE OF OURSELVES. THAT'S WHAT WE LIKE ABOUT OUR FRIENDS TO SARTRE.
POD1000000022_S0000125	FOR EXAMPLE IF A BIG PART OF THE WAY THAT YOU VIEW YOURSELF AND YOUR IDENTITY IS THAT YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF TO BE A SMART PERSON SARTRE WOULD PREDICT THAT MOST OF YOUR FRIENDS ARE GOING TO BE PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT SO SMART THAT TELL YOU YOU'RE SMART ALL THE TIME
POD1000000022_S0000126	OR PEOPLE THAT ASK YOU A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT YOU THEN ANSWER, MAKING YOU FEEL SMART, OR OTHER SMART PEOPLE THAT COMMEND YOU ON BEING SMART LIKE THEM. TO SARTRE, WE CHOOSE OUR FRIENDS BECAUSE THEY REINFORCE THE WAY THAT WE VIEW OURSELVES.
POD1000000022_S0000128	AND OF COURSE IT'S GOING TO FEEL VALIDATING. OF COURSE IT WOULD SEEM THAT YOU KNOW BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE WHO YOU ARE. BUT AGAIN, SARTRE WOULD SAY THAT THE TRUE MEASURE OF YOUR VALUES, THE TRUE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION, WHO ARE YOU?
POD1000000025_S0000006	I'M DAVID DIGGS.
POD1000000025_S0000007	I'M RAFAEL CASAL.
POD1000000025_S0000010	IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO SUMMARIZE THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN DAVID AND RAPHAEL BECAUSE AS BEST FRIENDS AND CREATIVE COLLABORATORS, THEY'VE DONE SO MUCH OVER THE YEARS TOGETHER.
POD1000000025_S0000011	LET ME START INDIVIDUALLY. DAVID DIGGS WON A TONY AND A GRAMMY FOR HIS PERFORMANCE IN HAMILTON,
POD1000000025_S0000012	HE PLAYED THOMAS JEFFERSON AND THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE IN THE ORIGINAL BROADWAY CAST.
POD1000000025_S0000014	RAFAEL CASAL IS AN ACTOR, WRITER, AND DIRECTOR. HE'S AN AWARD WINNING SLAM POET AND STARTED APPEARING ON HBO'S DEAF POETRY JAM AT THE AGE OF 18.
POD1000000025_S0000017	AND PRESIDENT OBAMA NAMED IT ONE OF HIS FAVORITE MOVIES OF THE YEAR.
POD1000000025_S0000018	BLINDSPOTTING TAKES PLACE IN OAKLAND, WHICH IS ALSO WHERE DAVID AND RAPHAEL ARE FROM.
POD1000000025_S0000019	THEIR STORY BEGINS AT BERKELEY HIGH SCHOOL. HERE'S TAVIT.
POD1000000025_S0000024	MY MEMORY OF HIM IN HIGH SCHOOL IS LIKE, DIGGS ALWAYS HAD LIKE A VERY NATIONAL WAY ABOUT HIM.
POD1000000025_S0000025	AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS PAINTS IT ACCURATELY, BUT THIS IS A REPRESENTATION OF IT. IT'S LIKE, AT SOME POINT DIGGS WAS LIKE, I'M JUST WEARING PAJAMA PANTS TO SCHOOL EVERY DAY.
POD1000000025_S0000045	SO OUR FRIEND JUSTIN WAS LIKE, YOU GUYS SHOULD WORK TOGETHER. YOU'RE TWO OF MY FAVORITE RAPPERS.
POD1000000025_S0000075	I DON'T HAVE THE TECHNICAL SKILLSET THAT RAFA HAS. SO LIKE, HE WAS SO FAST IN PRO TOOLS.
POD1000000025_S0000095	THIS IS ALSO GREAT. LISTEN TO HOW HE SAYS WE AT THIS ONE. THAT'S REALLY RAFA WAS KNOWN, RIGHT?
POD1000000025_S0000098	HE GOT NAMED ONE OF THOSE. BUT RAFA NEVER WOULD TAKE THAT FOR HIMSELF. AND IT WAS ALWAYS LIKE US,
POD1000000025_S0000116	THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND DIGS VERY MUCH AT ALL. I FEEL LIKE THE MORE COMMERCIAL BAY AREA SCENE,
POD1000000025_S0000124	WE WERE SLUMMING IT SO HARD WHEN WE GOT TO LA. WE WERE SO POOR. DIGGS WAS DELIVERING TACOS.
POD1000000025_S0000129	AND WE DID FIVE YEARS IN LA BEFORE DIGGS WENT TO NEW YORK TO DO HAMILTON.
POD1000000025_S0000130	I THINK THAT WAS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT CAME ABOUT FOR DIGGS REALLY ORGANICALLY.
POD1000000025_S0000131	HAMILTON WAS SUCH AN INTERESTING, LIKE, MUSCLE, LIKE, IT WAS A PLAY THAT WAS, LIKE, LEGIT WRITTEN FOR HIM TO FLEX ALL THE THINGS HE'S GOOD AT.
POD1000000025_S0000134	AND THE WORLD SAW DIGGS IN THE LIGHT THAT BEST SHOWED EVERYTHING. AND THEY NOT ONLY ACCEPTED, BUT OBSESSED OVER IT.
POD1000000025_S0000136	AND THE FIRST THING THAT HAPPENED IS THIS GIRL GRABS MY ARM AND LOOKS AT DIGGS AND GOES, OH MY GOD, IS THAT DAVI DIGGS TO ME?
POD1000000025_S0000137	AND I START TO REALIZE THAT THIS WOMAN IS ANNE HATHAWAY. AND SHE'S FANGIRLING OUT.
POD1000000025_S0000140	RAFA IS LIKE CALLING AND TEXTING AND EMAILING AND I'M LIKE GETTING BACK TO THE DEGREE THAT I CAN.
POD1000000025_S0000142	AND I REMEMBER I GOT SOMEBODY TURN DAYS AND I WAS LIKE, I'M THINKING ABOUT MOVING TO NEW YORK. SO YOU'LL RESPOND MORE IN PERSON.
POD1000000025_S0000143	AND I REMEMBER DIGGS GOES, I DIDN'T WANT TO ASK.
POD1000000025_S0000166	AND SO I'D WRITTEN THIS POEM ABOUT SORT OF LIKE THE NUMBNESS OF THAT EXPERIENCE OF LIKE, GOD, IS THIS LIKE WHAT LIFE IS?
POD1000000025_S0000170	DIGS, HE FINISHES THIS MASSIVE SENSATION IN NEW YORK. HE HAD LIKE 30 DAYS IN JUNE THAT HE COULD SHOOT THIS MOVIE.
POD1000000025_S0000177	IT'S JUST FUN IN MEETINGS POST BLINDSPOTTING NOW THAT WE'RE ASSOCIATED TOGETHER IN THIS WAY AND ALSO PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THAT RAPHAEL'S A GREAT ACTOR AS WELL AS A GREAT WRITER.
POD1000000025_S0000181	THE CLOSEST I HAVE EVER GOTTEN TO FIGHTING WITH RAFA, I THINK, IS LIKE WHEN SOMEBODY ELSE I'M CLOSE TO IS FIGHTING WITH RAFA, RIGHT?
POD1000000025_S0000189	DAVID DIGGS AND RAFAEL CASAL ARE PARTNERS.
POD1000000025_S0000191	YOU CAN FOLLOW THEM ON TWITTER OR INSTAGRAM AT DAVID DIGGS AND AT RAFAEL CASAL. RAFAEL PROBABLY STILL HAS THE PASSWORDS TO DAVID'S ACCOUNTS.
POD1000000025_S0000192	PARTNERS IS MADE BY ME, RISHIKESH HIRWAY. I PRODUCED, EDITED, AND MADE THE MUSIC FOR THE SHOW.
POD1000000025_S0000193	WITH EDITING HELP ON THIS EPISODE FROM MAUREEN HOBAN AND ZACH MCNEICE. PARTNERS IS A MAILCHIMP PODCAST MADE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH RADIOTOPIA.
POD1000000027_S0000009	FROM ESPN, YOU'RE LISTENING TO 30 FOR 30 PODCASTS. MY NAME IS JODY AVERGAN. WELCOME TO OUR FIFTH SEASON OF ORIGINAL AUDIO DOCUMENTARIES. AS WE'VE DONE BEFORE, WE'RE DEVOTING THE ENTIRE SEASON TO ONE STORY. IT'S TOLD OVER FIVE PARTS.
POD1000000027_S0000013	FOR THIS SEASON, WE'RE EXCITED TO WORK WITH ESPN'S RAMONA SHELBURNE, ONE OF OUR TOP NBA REPORTERS, AN LA NATIVE, AND SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN COVERING THIS STORY FROM THE MOMENT IT BROKE.
POD1000000027_S0000014	RAMONA IS YOUR HOST FOR ALL FIVE EPISODES. A QUICK WORD OF WARNING, THIS SEASON CONTAINS MATURE SUBJECT MATTER AND LANGUAGE. AND NOW, COMING UP AFTER THE BREAK, FROM 30 FOR 30 AND THE UNDEFEATED, THE STERLING AFFAIRS.
POD1000000027_S0000016	SHELLY STERLING THOUGHT SHE WAS JUST GOING TO RETURN SOME CLOTHES TO NEIMAN MARCUS WHEN SHE GOT IN HER MERCEDES BENZ STATION WAGON AND MADE THE DRIVE FROM MALIBU TO BEVERLY HILLS. IT WAS EARLY IN THE SPRING OF 2014.
POD1000000027_S0000017	AND EVEN THOUGH SHELLY WAS ALMOST 80 YEARS OLD, SHE WAS STILL GOING INTO TOWN, AS RICH PEOPLE CALL BEVERLY HILLS, FOUR OR FIVE DAYS A WEEK. IT'S HARD TO GUESS SHELLY'S AGE IF YOU DON'T KNOW IT.
POD1000000027_S0000019	THERE ARE THE ICONIC BROWN AND YELLOW SIGNS THAT LET YOU KNOW YOU HAVE ENTERED A SPECIAL PLACE. AND SHELLEY STERLING AND HER HUSBAND DONALD OWN A TON OF IT.
POD1000000027_S0000022	BUT MOST PEOPLE KNEW HER HUSBAND DONALD STERLING AS THE LONGTIME OWNER OF THE LOS ANGELES CLIPPERS, ONE OF THE WORST OWNERS IN ALL OF SPORTS. HIS TEAM WAS THE LAUGHINGSTOCK OF THE NBA FOR DECADES.
POD1000000027_S0000023	FOR SHELLY, IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN, WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST A JAUNT DOWN RODEO DRIVE TO RETURN SOME WILDLY EXPENSIVE CLOTHES. BUT UNBEKNOWNST TO HER, HER HUSBAND WAS ALSO AT NEIMAN MARCUS THAT DAY.
POD1000000027_S0000024	WITH A WOMAN 49 YEARS HIS JUNIOR NAMED VY STIVIANO. SHE WASN'T THE FIRST MISTRESS, NOT EVEN CLOSE. BUT VY WAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
POD1000000027_S0000026	SHELLEY TOLD ME THAT STORY WHEN WE MET IN THE WINTER OF 2019 AT THE BEVERLY HILLS PLAZA HOTEL, OR MY HOTEL, AS SHE CALLS IT.
POD1000000027_S0000027	SHELLY WAS 84 AT THE TIME, BUT SHE CAN TELL THAT STORY OF THAT RUN IN WITH DONALD AND V FIVE YEARS EARLIER WITH EXACTING DETAIL.
POD1000000027_S0000028	I HAPPENED TO BE THERE TO RETURN SOMETHING, AND SHE WAS THERE WITH DONALD AND WITH SOME OTHER FRIENDS. AND WE HAD A BIG CONFRONTATION. SHE WAS VERY, VERY, VERY NASTY AND MEAN TO ME.
POD1000000027_S0000029	WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT SHE RAN INTO SHELLY, I THINK AT NORDSTROM. AND THEY STARTED TALKING AND I GUESS THINGS GOT OUT OF HAND.
POD1000000027_S0000030	THAT'S V. SIVIANO'S LAWYER, MAC NEHORE. AND WHEN I TOLD SHELLEY STERLING HIS VERSION OF THE STORY, SHE SCOFFED.
POD1000000027_S0000032	AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY THAT SHELLEY TOOK THE TIME TO CORRECT HIM. I MEAN, HERE'S A WOMAN TALKING TO A FEMALE REPORTER ABOUT HER HUSBAND'S INFIDELITY. WHO CARES WHETHER YOU CONFRONT YOUR HUSBAND'S MISTRESS OUTSIDE OF NEIMAN MARCUS OR NORTYS?
POD1000000027_S0000034	THAT IN THE END LED TO ONE OF THE BIGGEST SCANDALS IN PROFESSIONAL SPORTS. A CONTROVERSY THAT FORCED THE NBA TO FINALLY DEAL WITH DONALD STERLING AFTER DECADES OF HIS BAD BEHAVIOR AND HAD RIPPLE EFFECTS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE LEAGUE.
POD1000000027_S0000036	THIS IS THE STERLING AFFAIRS FROM 30 FOR 30 PODCASTS AND THE UNDEFEATED. I'M RAMONA SHELBURNE.
POD1000000027_S0000041	I LEARNED PRETTY QUICKLY THAT THERE'S NO OTHER OWNER IN BASKETBALL WITH QUITE THE SAME PERSONALITY OR EGO AS DONALD STERLING. STERLING WASN'T A BASKETBALL GUY. HE WAS A PERSONAL INJURY LAWYER. AND THEN HE GOT FILTHY RICH OFF OF REAL ESTATE.
POD1000000027_S0000047	BUT RICH PEOPLE LIKE DONALD STERLING, MULTI BILLION DOLLAR RICH PEOPLE, DON'T LIVE IN THE SAME WORLD AS THE REST OF US. DON'T PLAY BY THE SAME RULES. WHEN YOU HAVE ENOUGH MONEY, IT'S LIKE YOU'RE RUBBER. EVERYTHING JUST BOUNCES OFF OF YOU.
POD1000000027_S0000048	EVEN THREE DECADES OF DRIVING AN NBA FRANCHISE INTO THE GROUND. WHEN YOU'RE AS RICH AS DONALD AND SHELLEY, YOU GET TO TELL YOURSELF THAT EVERYTHING IS FABULOUS.
POD1000000027_S0000060	AND DONALD STERLING'S LIFE WAS FABULOUS. WHY WOULD HE THINK OTHERWISE? NOBODY EVER QUESTIONED HIM TO HIS FACE ANYWAY. HE DID WHATEVER HE WANTED. HE SAID WHATEVER HE WANTED. HE HAD RELATIONSHIPS WITH WHOMEVER HE WANTED.
POD1000000027_S0000062	I DIDN'T KNOW V. STIVIANO BACK THEN. AND YES, THAT IS HER REAL NAME. V, JUST THE LETTER V WITH A PERIOD. SHE WAS BORN MARIA VANESSA PEREZ.
POD1000000027_S0000063	BUT CHANGED HER NAME TO V STIVIANO AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME SHE'D MET DONALD AT A SUPER BOWL PARTY IN 2010. BEFORE THAT, SHE'D BEEN TRYING DESPERATELY TO CLIMB OUT OF THE POVERTY THAT SHE'D GROWN UP IN.
POD1000000027_S0000064	SHE'D BEEN RUNNING A FOOD TRUCK BUSINESS AND TRYING TO WORK HER WAY ONTO REALITY TV SHOWS AND COZYING UP TO WHOMEVER WAS THE MOST RELEVANT, POWERFUL, OR FAMOUS. THEN SHE MET DONALD.
POD1000000027_S0000067	MONEY IN HER MAZE BAGS ARE GIFTS, AND NEVER, EVER HUMILIATE THE WIFE. BUT VISTAVIANO EITHER DIDN'T KNOW OR DIDN'T CARE, BECAUSE SHE BROKE EVERY LAST RULE IN THE MISTRESS' TERMS AND AGREEMENTS.
POD1000000027_S0000068	SHE WENT RIGHT AT SHELLY.
POD1000000027_S0000071	SHE KEPT TELLING PEOPLE SHE WAS GOING TO BE THE NEXT MRS. STERLING.
POD1000000027_S0000072	KATHERINE BAUMAN IS ONE OF SHELLEY'S BEST FRIENDS AND A LONGTIME CLIPPERS FAN.
POD1000000027_S0000073	SHE WOULD STALK SHELLY. SHE WOULD WATCH WHERE SHELLY WOULD GO, AND THEN SHE'D SHOW UP. AND I DO REMEMBER AT THE ONE TIME, SHE WENT INTO THE RESTROOM WHERE SHELLY WAS, JUST PARADED AROUND, SHOWED OFF HERSELF, THEN SHELLY WALKED OUT.
POD1000000027_S0000074	AT CLIPPERS GAMES, THE ENTIRE EXTENDED STERLING UNIVERSE WAS USUALLY THERE AND USUALLY JUST FEET FROM ONE ANOTHER. SOMETIMES SHELLY AND DONALD SAT IN THEIR COURT SIDE SEATS TOGETHER, AND V SAT IN HER SEATS DIRECTLY ACROSS THE COURT.
POD1000000027_S0000075	OTHER NIGHTS, V WOULD SIT NEXT TO DONALD AND SHELLY WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN. CLIPPER PLAYERS LIKE RYAN HOLLINS AND MATT BARNES GOT USED TO V BEING AROUND. YOU COULDN'T NOT NOTICE HER.
POD1000000027_S0000078	CLIPPER'S EMPLOYEES OFTEN GOT CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS BIZARRE TRIANGLE. SHELLEY WOULD CALL TEAM PRESIDENT ANDY ROSER, DEMANDING THAT V NOT BE ALLOWED IN THE BUILDING. AND THEN DONALD WOULD CALL ROSER AND ASK HIM TO LEAVE FOUR TICKETS FOR HER.
POD1000000027_S0000079	THESE WERE RELATIONSHIPS BEGGING TO IMPLODE. BUT NONE OF THE ENTANGLED EVER TRIED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. DONALD, SHELLY, V, EACH KEPT PUSHING EACH OTHER, WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO BREAK.
POD1000000027_S0000080	WELL, THE BREAKING STARTED ON CHRISTMAS DAY, 2012. V CALLED THE STERLING HOUSE ASKING TO SPEAK TO DONALD.
POD1000000027_S0000082	SHELLY WAS MORTIFIED. THE FAMILY WAS SITTING AT THE DINNER TABLE WAITING FOR DONALD AS HE'S PACING ON THE TENNIS COURTS OUTSIDE FIGHTING WITH HIS MISTRESS.
POD1000000027_S0000085	THE FIGHT WITH SHELLY STARTED WHEN HE HUNG UP.
POD1000000027_S0000086	NOT THAT THAT WAS UNCOMMON. EVEN WITHOUT V, THEY FOUGHT OFTEN. BUT THIS WAS ESCALATING. SHELLY AND DONALD'S YOUNGEST SON, SCOTT, HAD TO STEP IN BEFORE IT GOT PHYSICAL. HE CONFRONTED HIS FATHER AND DEMANDED HE STOP THIS NONSENSE WITH V.
POD1000000027_S0000091	A WEEK LATER, SCOTT DIED.
POD1000000027_S0000100	SHELLY WAS DEVASTATED.
POD1000000027_S0000103	IT WASN'T JUST THAT THE FIGHT WITH V WAS THE LAST VOLATILE MOMENT BETWEEN DONALD AND SCOTT.
POD1000000027_S0000105	WHEN SCOTT DIED, DONALD STAYED WITH VEE INSTEAD OF GOING HOME TO HIS WIFE AS SHE GRIEVED. IT WAS TOO MUCH. SHE KICKED DON OUT OF THE HOUSE.
POD1000000027_S0000107	SHELLY NEEDED BREATHING ROOM AND I THINK DON HAD PUSHED THE ENVELOPE A LITTLE TOO FAR.
POD1000000027_S0000110	BUT SHELLY AND DONALD HAD BEEN TOGETHER TOO LONG, BEEN THROUGH TOO MUCH TOGETHER, HAD TOO MUCH OF THEIR LIVES AND THEIR MONEY INTERTWINED.
POD1000000027_S0000112	THEY DID NOT DIVORCE. THE SITUATION SIMPLY CONTINUED TO DETERIORATE OVER THE NEXT YEAR AS DONALD SPENT MORE AND MORE TIME WITH VEE.
POD1000000027_S0000114	PLUS, SHELLEY WAS STARTING TO LEARN ABOUT THE GIFTS. V POSTED PICTURES ON INSTAGRAM. V DRIVING THE $240,000 RED FERRARI THAT DONALD HAD BOUGHT HER.
POD1000000027_S0000115	AND THE RANGE ROVER, AND THE TWO BENTLEYS. SHELLEY ALSO FOUND OUT THAT DONALD HAD BOUGHT V A $1.8 MILLION DUPLEX.
POD1000000027_S0000117	IT WAS THAT ANGER THAT SHELLY BROUGHT TO NEIMAN MARCUS WITH HER RETURNS ON THE FATEFUL DAY THAT SHE ENCOUNTERED DONALD AND V. IT WASN'T THE FIRST TIME THE TWO WOMEN HAD RUN INTO EACH OTHER OR ARGUED. BUT THIS TIME, SHELLY DECIDED SHE'D HAD ENOUGH.
POD1000000027_S0000119	ON MARCH 7, 2014, SHELLEY STERLING FILED A LAWSUIT IN CALIFORNIA SUPERIOR COURT AGAINST VISTIVIANO, SEEKING THE RETURN OF ALL THOSE GIFTS FROM DONALD.
POD1000000027_S0000121	DONALD AND SHELLEY STERLING WERE WORTH MULTIPLE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND HAD DONE WHAT THE ULTRA RICH DO, PUT ALL THEIR MONEY AND PROPERTY INTO A JOINT TRUST.
POD1000000027_S0000122	EVERY DIME THAT THE STERLING SPENT COST EACH OF THEM A NICKEL. THEREFORE, SHELLEY ARGUED, THE MONEY THAT DONALD USED TO PAY FOR THE GIFTS WAS JUST AS MUCH HERS AS IT WAS HIS.
POD1000000027_S0000123	SO SHE TURNED TO THE COURTS. THAT SOUNDS A LITTLE EXTREME. WELL, YOU DON'T KNOW THE STERLINGS. CALLING A LAWYER IS HOW THEY GET OUT OF BED IN THE MORNING.
POD1000000027_S0000126	SHE KEPT SAYING TO DONALD, YOU BETTER HAVE HER DROP THE LAWSUIT. AND HE'D SAY, OH, SHE WON'T REALLY GO THROUGH WITH IT, BUT SHE'S JUST DOING IT FOR A FACT. AND SHE SAYS, WELL, SHE BETTER DROP THE LAWSUIT.
POD1000000027_S0000127	BUT HERE'S HOW THE LAWSUIT, THE COURTROOM PRODUCT OF A BEDROOM DISPUTE, REALLY CAME TO CHANGE EVERYTHING. FOR SOME TIME NOW, V HAD BEEN RECORDING HER CONVERSATIONS WITH DONALD.
POD1000000027_S0000128	SWEETIE, I'M SORRY.
POD1000000027_S0000130	AND ACCORDING TO V AND HER LAWYER, DONALD WAS AWARE SHE WAS MAKING THE TAPES.
POD1000000027_S0000135	SHE'D RECORDED HUNDREDS OF CONVERSATIONS OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS. A LOT OF THE RECORDINGS WERE MUNDANE, BORING EVEN. BUT SOME OF THE RECORDINGS WERE ARGUMENTS, AND CAPTURE DECIDED DONALD THAT HE WOULD NEVER WANT HIS WIFE OR ANYONE ELSE TO HEAR.
POD1000000027_S0000137	NO MATTER WHAT THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THOSE TAPES WAS, THEY BECAME SOMETHING V COULD USE AS BLACKMAIL, BECAUSE V STIVIANO HAD NO INTENTION OF RETURNING THOSE GIFTS FROM DONALD.
POD1000000027_S0000139	V SAYS TO DONALD, I WANT THAT BITCH WIFE OF YOURS LAWSUIT DISMISSED.
POD1000000027_S0000140	PIERCE O'DONNELL IS SHELLEY STERLING'S LAWYER.
POD1000000027_S0000141	AND HE TRIED TO GET SHELLY DISMISSED AND SHE WOULDN'T DO IT.
POD1000000027_S0000142	IF DONALD COULDN'T OR WOULDN'T FIX THE SITUATION, V DECIDED SHE WOULD TAKE MATTERS INTO HER OWN HANDS. IT WAS TIME TO USE THE TAPES.
POD1000000027_S0000143	TO REVEAL DONALD STERLING FOR WHO HE REALLY WAS.
POD1000000027_S0000161	ON APRIL 9, 2014, A CLIPPERS EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT TEXTED V ON BEHALF OF DONALD.
POD1000000027_S0000166	MR. STERLING SAID TO LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED ANYTHING. WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANY ISSUES AT THE GAME.
POD1000000027_S0000178	IT WAS SHOCKING. THE CLIPPERS' ASSISTANT IMMEDIATELY EMAILED THE FILE TO CLIPPERS' PRESIDENT, ANDY ROSER. AND THAT'S HOW SHELLY LEARNED ABOUT THE TAPE, TOO.
POD1000000027_S0000180	AND I SAID, WELL, WHAT IS THE TAPE ABOUT? SO I SAID TO ANDY, ANDY ROSE, I SAID, ANDY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT THIS? AND HE SAYS, OH, WELL, SHE'LL NEVER DO ANYTHING.
POD1000000027_S0000181	ROSER HAD WORKED FOR DONALD STERLING FOR NEARLY THREE DECADES. HE DID WHAT EVERYBODY LEARNS TO DO AFTER A WHILE, STAY OUT OF THE REALLY UGLY STUFF.
POD1000000027_S0000182	DONALD AND SHELLEY HAD CLEANED UP THEIR OWN MESSES FOR SIX DECADES. HE FIGURED THEY'D EVENTUALLY MAKE THIS ONE GO AWAY, TOO. BUT THEY DIDN'T. SHELLEY TOLD HER LAWYERS ABOUT THE TAPES.
POD1000000027_S0000183	AND THEY, IN TURN, WENT TO V'S LAWYER AND DEMANDED TO HEAR THEM. AND THAT'S WHEN V'S TIVIANO MADE HER BIG MOVE.
POD1000000027_S0000186	MIKE WALTERS WAS THE NEWS DIRECTOR AT TMZ AT THE TIME. NOW HE RUNS HIS OWN CELEBRITY NEWS SITE, THE BLAST.
POD1000000027_S0000187	THE FIRST THING I DID WAS SAY, WHO'S DONALD STERLING? I HAD HEARD THE NAME. I KNEW THAT DONALD STERLING WAS IMPORTANT, BUT I HAD NO IDEA THAT HE OWNED THE CLIPPERS.
POD1000000027_S0000201	THE FACT IS, SHELLEY AND SEVERAL PEOPLE IN THE CLIPPERS' ORGANIZATION HEARD THE RECORDING AND DECIDED NOT TO ACT ON IT, OR WEREN'T APPALLED ENOUGH TO ACT ON IT. MAYBE THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW BIG A SPLASH THIS TAPE COULD MAKE.
POD1000000027_S0000209	SO MIKE WALTERS CALLED UP THE NBA. THEIR NEW COMMISSIONER, ADAM SILVER, HAD BARELY BEEN IN OFFICE FOR THREE MONTHS.
POD1000000027_S0000210	I ACTUALLY HAD NEVER HEARD OF ADAM SILVER UNTIL THAT DAY.
POD1000000027_S0000217	AFTER CALLING THE LEAGUE, TMZ CALLED THE CLIPPERS TO LET THEM KNOW THEY WERE ABOUT TO PUBLISH A TAPE THAT WOULD BE VERY DAMAGING TO DONALD STERLING.
POD1000000027_S0000218	IF YOU'RE DONALD STERLING, THERE'S NEVER A GOOD TIME TO HAVE YOUR GIRLFRIEND OUT YOU AS A RACIST. IF YOU'RE THE CLIPPERS, THIS COULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED AT A WORSE MOMENT. DONALD STERLING'S CLIPPERS HAVE BEEN A LAUGHINGSTOCK FOR DECADES.
POD1000000027_S0000220	I MEAN, BECAUSE HONESTLY, LIKE THESE CLIPPERS JOKES ARE SOMETHING WE, THEY'RE NOT EVEN JOKES, THEY'RE STATEMENTS OF FACT.
POD1000000027_S0000222	IN THE 30 SOME ODD YEARS HE'D OWNED THE TEAM, THEY'D ONLY MADE THE PLAYOFFS SIX TIMES. THEY'D NEVER EVEN MOVED PAST THE SEMIFINALS. THAT HAD ALL STARTED TO CHANGE IN THE LATE 2000S, THOUGH. THE TEAM HAD DRAFTED A STAR, BLAKE GRIFFIN,
POD1000000027_S0000223	NBA ROOKIE OF THE YEAR, BLAKE GRIFFIN.
POD1000000027_S0000225	AND THEN ENDED UP WITH ANOTHER STAR, CHRIS PAUL.
POD1000000027_S0000226	LOS ANGELES IS ELECTRIC WITH THE ADDITION OF CHRIS PAUL TO THE CLIPPERS.
POD1000000027_S0000231	IN TIME FOR THIS SEASON, THE CLIPPERS HAD ALSO MANAGED TO GET THEMSELVES ONE OF THE BEST COACHES IN THE NBA, DOC RIVERS.
POD1000000027_S0000232	IT'S DOC RIVERS TO THE CLIPPERS, THREE YEARS, $21 MILLION.
POD1000000027_S0000240	ONCE THE CLIPPERS' STAFF FOUND OUT TMZ WAS GOING TO PUBLISH THE TAPE, ANDY ROSER WENT TO COACH DOC RIVERS. HE NEEDED HIM TO TALK TO THE TEAM BEFORE THE STORY BROKE.
POD1000000027_S0000241	ANDY, I REMEMBER COMING IN MY OFFICE ONE DAY AND SAID, HEY, THERE'S A TAPE THAT TMZ HAS THAT'S GOING TO COME OUT. IT'S NOT THAT FLATTERING, BUT IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL. HONESTLY, I THOUGHT IT WAS A SEX TAPE BECAUSE OF DONALD STERLING. I REALLY DID.
POD1000000027_S0000242	SO DOC DID AS HE WAS TOLD AND GATHERED THE PLAYERS AND WARNED THEM THAT SOMETHING WAS COMING. SUPERSTAR CLIPPERS FORWARD BLAKE GRIFFIN AND CENTER RYAN HOLLINS WERE IN THAT ROOM.
POD1000000027_S0000243	DOC GATHERED US.
POD1000000027_S0000244	DOC SAID, HEY, GUYS, WE NEED TO MEET AND TALK.
POD1000000027_S0000253	THERE'S AN AUDIO RECORDING PURPORTEDLY OF LOS ANGELES CLIPPERS OWNER DONALD STERLING MAKING RACIST REMARKS TO HIS GIRLFRIEND AS BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION.
POD1000000027_S0000268	LIKE TMZ'S MIKE WALTERS. AS SOON AS I HEARD THAT TAPE, I KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO BE HUGE.
POD1000000027_S0000270	STERLING HAS A LONG HISTORY OF QUESTIONABLE BEHAVIOR
POD1000000027_S0000273	WITHIN HOURS, THE AUDIO OF DONALD STERLING MAKING RACIST REMARKS TO V. STIVIANO HAD GONE VIRAL.
POD1000000027_S0000278	BY MORNING, LEBRON JAMES, THE BIGGEST STAR IN THE LEAGUE, WAS SAYING, THERE'S NO ROOM FOR A PERSON LIKE DONALD STERLING IN THE NBA.
POD1000000027_S0000280	AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY, ADAM SILVER WAS FACING HIS FIRST REAL CRISIS.
POD1000000027_S0000281	NBA COMMISSIONER ADAM SILVER SITTING DOWN IN MEMPHIS ADDRESSING THE COMMENTS MADE BY DONALD STERLING.
POD1000000027_S0000284	I AM NOT YET PREPARED TO DISCUSS ANY POTENTIAL SANCTIONS AGAINST DONALD STERLING. WE WILL, HOWEVER, MOVE EXTRAORDINARILY QUICKLY IN OUR INVESTIGATION.
POD1000000027_S0000286	IF IT WAS STERLING ON THOSE TAPES, IF THEY HADN'T BEEN DOCTORED OR ALTERED, SILVER KNEW HE WANTED TO PUNISH HIM SEVERELY. THE LEAGUE WAS OUTRAGED.
POD1000000027_S0000287	BECAUSE ON TOP OF DONALD STERLING SAYING ALL THOSE UNFORGIVABLY RACIST THINGS, STERLING WAS ALSO TAKING SHOTS AT ONE OF THE MOST BELOVED FIGURES IN ALL OF BASKETBALL, MAGIC JOHNSON.
POD1000000027_S0000289	IT WAS AS SHOCKING AND AS BIZARRE AS ANYTHING ON THE TAPE THAT A PICTURE OF V. STIVIANO AND MAGIC JOHNSON HAD SET HIM OFF. TO HEAR DONALD STERLING TALK THAT WAY ABOUT MAGIC?
POD1000000027_S0000290	THE GUY WHO TURNED THE LAKERS INTO A DYNASTY? WHO'D FOUGHT OFF HIV? THAT'S THE GUY DONALD STERLING TOLD HIS MISTRESS WASN'T WELCOME AT HIS GAMES?
POD1000000027_S0000294	EVEN THE FAMOUSLY APOLITICAL MICHAEL JORDAN VOICED HIS OUTRAGE.
POD1000000027_S0000295	MICHAEL JORDAN WEIGHED IN. THERE IS NO ROOM IN THE NBA OR ANYWHERE ELSE FOR THE KIND OF RACISM AND HATRED THAT MR. STERLING ALLEGEDLY EXPRESSED. WE CANNOT TOLERATE, MUST NOT TOLERATE DISCRIMINATION AT ANY LEVEL.
POD1000000027_S0000298	IT'S LIKE WHAT ONE OF THE PAPARAZZI WHO WAS TAILING DONALD AND SHELLEY TOLD ME. IT HAD ALL THE ELEMENTS. SEX, MONEY, SPORTS, POLITICS, GREED, RACISM.
POD1000000027_S0000299	IT HAD EVERYTHING. IT EVEN HAD THE VISOR. YOU REMEMBER THE VISOR. THAT DAFT PUNK WELDING MASK MEETS FLORIDA GRANDMA VISOR THAT BEASTIVIANA WORE ANYTIME SHE STEPPED OUTSIDE OF HER HOUSE?
POD1000000027_S0000300	BUT STILL SAYING NOTHING IS VISTA VIANO, NOT LATE THIS AFTERNOON WHEN SHE ARRIVED HOME OR WHEN SHE LEFT TONIGHT, WEARING DIFFERENT CLOTHES BUT COLOR COORDINATED FACE SHIELDS.
POD1000000027_S0000302	HAVE YOU TALKED TO MR. STERLING? CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE MASK?
POD1000000027_S0000306	BY THE END OF THE WEEKEND, THE FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS ANSWERING QUESTIONS ABOUT STERLING.
POD1000000027_S0000309	THE TAPES DOMINATED THE NEWS CYCLE, NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY WERE JUICY, BUT BECAUSE DONALD STERLING WAS ARTICULATING SOMETHING DEEPER, MORE SHAMEFUL.
POD1000000027_S0000314	INCLUDING RYAN HOLLAND.
POD1000000027_S0000318	LOS ANGELES SITS ON TWO FAULT LINES, SAN ANDREAS AND RACE. ALL OF US KNOW IT. WE LIVE WITH IT. DONALD STERLING WAS ANOTHER.
POD1000000027_S0000319	ANYONE WHO PLAYED FOR HIM OR WORKED FOR HIM, OR COVERED HIM IN THE PRESS, OR LIVED IN ONE OF HIS HUNDREDS OF APARTMENTS, ON THE ONE HAND KNEW THAT IT WAS ALL A MATTER OF TIME UNTIL HE BLEW UP. THE UNDERLYING ISSUES WITH STERLING WERE WELL KNOWN AND WELL DOCUMENTED.
POD1000000027_S0000320	BUT LIKE MOST INSANELY WEALTHY WHITE MEN IN AMERICA, DONALD HAD MANAGED TO WIGGLE, BULLY, AND FIGHT HIS WAY OUT OF ALL OF THEM. HE KNEW HOW TO PLAY HIS LEVERAGE AND POWER TO OUTLAST HIS ADVERSARIES AND WIN, IF YOU CAN CALL IT THAT.
POD1000000029_S0000002	FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA, THIS IS MARKETPLACE TECH, DEMYSTIFYING THE DIGITAL ECONOMY. I'M JACK STEWART IN FOR MOLLY WOOD.
POD1000000029_S0000006	NEARLY EVERY CRISIS FACEBOOK NOW FACES STEMS FROM THAT. NICHOLAS THOMPSON, EDITOR IN CHIEF OF WIRED, SAYS THAT'S LEFT MANAGEMENT TO NAVIGATE A METAPHORICAL MINEFIELD.
POD1000000029_S0000010	SECONDLY, ONE OF THE SMARTEST BUSINESS DECISIONS THAT MARK ZUCKERBERG EVER MADE WAS TO BUY INSTAGRAM. AND PEOPLE DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT INSTAGRAM IS OWNED BY FACEBOOK, OR IF THEY DISTRUST FACEBOOK, THEY DON'T DISTRUST INSTAGRAM. SO INSTAGRAM CONTINUES TO GROW.
POD1000000029_S0000023	ABSOLUTELY. WHAT ARE THE STAKES TO THEIR BUSINESS? THEY ARE VERY HIGH. IF THE SCANDAL CONTINUES TO MULTIPLY, THERE COULD BE REAL CONSEQUENCES DOWN THE ROAD. WHAT ARE THE STAKES SPECIFICALLY TO TOP MANAGEMENT, MEANING MARK ZUCKERBERG AND SHERYL SANDBERG, THE TWO PEOPLE WHO WE MOST ASSOCIATE WITH THE COMPANY?
POD1000000029_S0000024	FOR ZUCKERBERG, HE'S GOING TO RUN THE COMPANY AS LONG AS HE WANTS TO. HE HAS VOTING CONTROL OF THE SHARES. HE'S APPOINTED HIS FRIENDS AS BOARD MEMBERS. HE IS IN A GOOD POSITION.
POD1000000029_S0000025	WHENEVER HE WANTS TO GO AND RUN THE CHAN ZUCKERBERG INITIATIVE OR JUST GO BE AN INTELLECTUAL THOUGHT LEADER OR DO BILL GATES TYPE THINGS, HE WILL GO CHOOSE TO DO THAT. FOR SANDBERG, IT'S TOUGHER.
POD1000000029_S0000026	AND THERE WERE MOMENTS IN THE LAST YEAR WHERE IT SEEMED LIKE SHE MIGHT BE SACRIFICED OR WHERE SHE MIGHT BE IN BIG TROUBLE. ZUCKERBERG HAS EXPRESSED HIS LOYALTY TO HER.
POD1000000029_S0000036	THERE WAS ONE SPECIFIC STORY THAT STUNNED ME. AND THAT WAS THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LED TO THE DEPARTURE OF THE TWO FOUNDERS OF INSTAGRAM, KEVIN SYSTROM AND MIKE KRIEGER.
POD1000000029_S0000037	AND WHEN FRED VOGELSTEIN AND I STARTED REPORTING THE STORY, WE MADE A LIST OF THE MYSTERIES WE WANTED TO SOLVE. THAT WAS AT THE VERY TOP. WHY HAD THEY LEFT? IT SEEMS STRANGE. THEY HAD LEFT ALL OF A SUDDEN IN SEPTEMBER.
POD1000000029_S0000038	NO ONE KNEW WHY. AND LATE IN THE REPORTING, YOU KNOW, MONTHS INTO REPORTING THE STORY, WE FINALLY LEARNED THE FULL STORY. AND THAT IS THAT ACCORDING TO PEOPLE CLOSE TO THEM, THEY HAD GROWN FRUSTRATED WITH ZUCKERBERG'S INCREASED MEDDLING.
POD1000000029_S0000040	AND THERE IS A SENSE AMONG SOME PEOPLE AT FACEBOOK THAT INSTAGRAM'S GROWTH WAS COMING AT THE EXPENSE OF CORE FACEBOOK. AND THAT LED TO ALL KINDS OF TENSIONS AND THEN A BIG FIGHT AT THE END OF JULY AND A MOMENT WHERE MARK ZUCKERBERG,
POD1000000029_S0000042	AND THEN HE GAVE THE LIST TO KEVIN SYSTROM AND SAID, WE'RE GETTING RID OF ALL OF THESE. AND ACCORDING TO PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH THE STORY, SYSTROM REACTED QUITE BADLY TO THAT. AND THEN WENT ON PATERNITY LEAVE, CAME BACK AND SAID, I'M DONE HERE.
POD1000000029_S0000043	AND SO THE BIGGEST SURPRISE TO US WAS THAT THE DEPARTURE OF SISTER MCGREGOR, WHICH HADN'T COME OUT BEFORE, WAS MUCH TENSER, MUCH TENSER THAN I HAD BELIEVED WHEN I BEGAN REPORTING THIS STORY.
POD1000000029_S0000044	NICK THOMPSON, EDITOR IN CHIEF OF WIRED. FOR CONTEXT, A $5 BILLION FINE WOULD BE A RECORD TECH PENALTY IN THE US, BEATING THE $22 MILLION THAT GOOGLE HAD TO PAY IN 2012.
POD1000000029_S0000049	IF YOU ENJOYED MARK ZUCKERBERG'S TESTIMONY IN FRONT OF CONGRESS HERE IN THE US WITH HIS ZINGING COMEBACKS LIKE, SENATOR, WE RUN ADS, THEN MAYBE YOU'LL ENJOY HEARING MORE DIRECTLY FROM MR. ZUCKERBERG HIMSELF.
POD1000000029_S0000050	I MEAN, FACEBOOK WAS ACCUSED OF NOT BEING OPEN ENOUGH. I'M NOT REALLY SURE HOW DEEP INTO THE HEADS OF TECH ENTREPRENEURS YOU REALLY WANT TO GET, BUT ZUCK DOES HAVE A PODCAST NOW. I'M NOT SUGGESTING YOU LISTEN. I'M JUST GIVING YOU THIS INFORMATION
POD1000000029_S0000051	IT'S CALLED TECH AND SOCIETY WITH MARK ZUCKERBERG. JUST, YEAH, DON'T AT ME. MATT PURDY PRODUCED THIS WEEK'S MARKETPLACE TECH, ALONG WITH STEPHANIE HUGHES AND YVES TROT IS OUR SENIOR PRODUCER.
POD1000000033_S0000001	IF YOU WANT TO GET BROADBAND ACCESS TO EVERY STATE, YOU GOT TO KNOW THE LOCAL LAWS. FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA, THIS IS MARKETPLACE TECH, DEMYSTIFYING THE DIGITAL ECONOMY. I'M MOLLY WOOD.

POD1000000038_S0000006	EMMA THOMPSON IS IN IT AS A CELEBRITY BRITISH POLITICIAN WITH AUTOCRATIC LEANINGS, BUT MAINLY THE SHOW FOLLOWS A FAMILY AS THEY DEAL WITH THE WORLD CHANGING AROUND THEM.

POD1000000038_S0000078	I'M MOLLY WOOD AND THAT'S MARKETPLACE TECH. HAVE A SAFE AND HEALTHY WEEKEND OR, AS I SAW IT PUT ON TWITTER,
POD1000000047_S0000000	WELCOME TO THE 80,000 HOURS PODCAST. THIS INTERVIEW WITH DAVID SPIEGELHALTER IS A BIT UNUSUAL IN THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY RECORDED TWO YEARS AGO.
POD1000000047_S0000002	WE WERE CONSIDERING STARTING A PODCAST BACK THEN, AND I RECORDED THIS TRIAL EPISODE WITH MY COLLEAGUE, JESS WHITTLESTONE, BUT ULTIMATELY WE DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME TO GO AHEAD WITH THE PROJECT. BUT I THOUGHT, WHY NOT DIG IT UP AND RELEASE IT NOW?
POD1000000047_S0000004	DAVID SPIEGELHOLDER IS A STATISTICIAN AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE AND SOMETHING OF AN ACADEMIC CELEBRITY IN THE UK.
POD1000000047_S0000016	TO HELP US ANSWER SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS, WE'RE JOINED BY PROFESSOR DAVID SPIEGELHALTER, THE WINTON PROFESSOR FOR THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF RISK AT CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY. PROFESSOR SPIEGELHALTER SPENT MUCH OF HIS LIFE TRYING TO IMPROVE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF STATISTICS, SCIENCE, AND RISK IN ORDINARY LIFE.
POD1000000047_S0000115	YEAH, I'VE ACTUALLY WRITTEN AN ARTICLE WITH PROFESSOR TOBY ORD ABOUT WHY WE SHOULDN'T DISCOUNT HEALTH, EVEN THOUGH WE SHOULD DISCOUNT FINANCIAL RETURNS, ABOUT WHY IT'S APPROPRIATE IN ONE CASE AND NOT IN THE OTHER. SO WE'LL PUT UP A LINK TO THAT ON THE WEBSITE.
POD1000000047_S0000244	YEAH, I THINK THAT'S ABOUT ALL WE'VE GOT TIME FOR NOW. BUT THANKS SO MUCH, DAVID. THIS HAS BEEN VERY INFORMATIVE AND REALLY INTERESTING.
POD1000000047_S0000247	RIGHT. IF YOU'D LIKE TO HEAR MORE FROM PROFESSOR SPIEGELHALTER, THEN YOU CAN FIND HIS BLOG, UNDERSTANDING UNCERTAINTY, ONLINE. AND HE'S ALSO OFTEN ON THE RADIO IN THE UK, IN PARTICULAR ON MORE OR LESS ON BBC4.
POD1000000048_S0000001	HI, I'M ROB, DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH AT 80,000 HOURS. TODAY I'M SPEAKING WITH MYLES BRUNDAGE, RESEARCH FELLOW AT THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD'S FUTURE OF HUMANITY INSTITUTE.
POD1000000048_S0000003	MILES' RESEARCH HAS BEEN SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, THE BIPARTISAN POLICY CENTRE AND THE FUTURE OF LIFE INSTITUTE. THANKS FOR MAKING TIME TO TALK TO US TODAY, MILES.
POD1000000048_S0000051	AND MILES, YOU HAVE A FORTHCOMING GUIDE TO WORK ON AI POLICY AND STRATEGY THAT WE'RE GOING TO LINK TO. SO HERE WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO GO BEYOND THAT. SO IF YOU FIND YOURSELF A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED, THEN POTENTIALLY JUST GO AND READ ONE OF THOSE DOCUMENTS FIRST.
POD1000000048_S0000059	SO THERE'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF WORK, FOR EXAMPLE, BY ARMSTRONG ET AL AT THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY INSTITUTE, LOOKING AT ARMS RACE TYPE SCENARIOS INVOLVING AI, WHERE THERE WOULD BE AN INCENTIVE TO SKIMP.
POD1000000048_S0000095	SO THE EXAMPLE I MENTIONED OF THE PAPER BY ARMSTRONG ET AL. CALLED THE RACING TO THE PRECIPICE IS ONE EXAMPLE AND IT PRESENTED SORT OF A STARK VERSION OF THE ARMS RACE SCENARIO.
POD1000000048_S0000100	PROGRESS TO BE MADE. SO THERE WAS A PAPER PUT OUT BY THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY INSTITUTE BY NICK BOSTROM, KIRK FLYNN, AND ALAN DEFOE RECENTLY THAT LOOKS AT POLICY DESIDERATA FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF MACHINE SUPERINTELLIGENCE.
POD1000000048_S0000116	ANOTHER RESOURCE THAT COMES TO MIND IS A SYLLABUS FOR A CLASS ON THE GLOBAL POLITICS OF AI DEVELOPED BY ALAN DEFOE AT YALE AND THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY INSTITUTE.
POD1000000048_S0000191	SO OTHERWISE, I WOULD SAY THAT THAT IS A GOOD PLACE TO GO. SO AND LIKEWISE, WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE AGENDA OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS ON THE AI FRONT.
POD1000000048_S0000314	YEAH, AND I SUPPOSE YOU CAN ALWAYS JUST TRACK THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE LIKE YOU OR NICK BOSTROM ARE SAYING AND HOW YOU SPEAK ABOUT THE ISSUE SO THAT YOU DON'T COME ACROSS AS ALARMIST AND YOU HAVE A MEASURED AND PRECISE TONE.
POD1000000048_S0000338	SO THERE ARE PEOPLE AT FHI WHO ALSO ARE AFFILIATED WITH THE CENTER FOR EFFECTIVE ALTRUISM AND INVOLVED IN BUILDING THE EA COMMUNITY, LIKE OWEN COTTON BARRETT AND TOBY ORD.
POD1000000048_S0000350	AND IT TOOK THE WORK OF NICK BOSTROM AND SUPER INTELLIGENCE AND STUART RUSSELL AND GIVING A LOT OF TALKS AND WRITING OP EDS TO CALL MORE ATTENTION TO IT AND GIVE IT MORE LEGITIMACY.
YOU1000000000_S0000003	HI AND WELCOME BACK. I'M MIKE QUINCY.
YOU1000000000_S0000009	SO TO TAKE US THROUGH THE PROCESS, RYAN, HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHAT DO YOU DRIVE EVERY NIGHT?
YOU1000000000_S0000043	AND SO CONSIDERING WHAT WE HAVE ON HAND RIGHT NOW, SO MIKE, WHAT'S KIND OF A GO TO CAR THAT YOU FIND YOURSELF SIGNING UP FOR?
YOU1000000000_S0000054	THAT'S WHY IT DOESN'T GET COLD.
YOU1000000000_S0000058	AND SO RYAN, WHEN YOU CAN CHOOSE, WHAT DO YOU FIND?
YOU1000000000_S0000074	THIS WAS HOTLY ANTICIPATED BY THOSE OF US THAT LOVE PICKUPS. SO MIKE, IF YOU COULD, GIVE US A QUICK RUNDOWN OF THE RANGER AND HOW IT GOT HERE.
YOU1000000000_S0000125	I'M WITH RYAN ON THIS ACTUALLY. IT'S NOT A SMOOTH RIDE.
YOU1000000000_S0000144	IT SHOULD BE A GRAB HANDLE TO GET IN. IT IS KIND OF TALL, I NOTICED, TOO.
YOU1000000000_S0000257	AND WE ACTUALLY DID A VIDEO ON THIS WITH JEN STOCKBURGER. THAT'S ONLINE, RIGHT, PRODUCER DAVE? CAN PEOPLE CHECK THAT VIDEO OUT?
YOU1000000000_S0000258	SURE. SO CHECK OUT THAT VIDEO BECAUSE JEN TELLS YOU, SHE SHOWS YOU WHERE ALL THE SENSORS ARE ON THE CARS AND HOW TO CLEAN THEM.
YOU1000000006_S0000009	SO LET'S SAY JASON WARDROP AND YOU WANT TO HAVE A PROFILE PICTURE OF YOURSELF BECAUSE A BIG PART OF SOCIAL MEDIA IS PERSONAL BRANDING
YOU1000000008_S0000003	HEY, IT'S JUSTIN BROWN HERE FROM PRIMAL VIDEO, WHERE WE HELP ENTREPRENEURS AND BUSINESS OWNERS AMPLIFY THEIR BUSINESS AND THEIR BRAND WITH VIDEO.
YOU1000000012_S0000002	HEY, IT'S JUSTIN BROWN HERE FROM PRIMAL VIDEO. WE RELEASE A TON OF CONTENT TO HELP YOU GET BETTER RESULTS WITH YOUR VIDEOS FASTER.
YOU1000000016_S0000003	HEY, IT'S JUSTIN BROWN HERE FROM PRIMAL VIDEO, WHERE WE HELP YOU AMPLIFY YOUR BUSINESS AND BRAND WITH VIDEO.
YOU1000000016_S0000106	SO NOW LOOKING AT THE PRICING OPTIONS, I THINK THIS IS REALLY WHERE CASTA SHINES. THEY HAVE A FREE PLAN WITH NO BRANDING, NO WATERMARKS,
YOU1000000016_S0000116	BUT IF YOU'RE SOMEONE WHO'S NOT LOOKING FOR ALL THOSE ADVANCED FEATURES AND REALLY WANTS THE BEST BANG FOR BUCK TO BE ABLE TO GET YOUR BROADCAST OUT TO MULTIPLE PLATFORMS,
YOU1000000016_S0000123	I'M IN AUSTRALIA NOW, SO I'LL PICK SYDNEY, BUT CHOOSE THE CLOSEST ONE TO YOU.
YOU1000000016_S0000146	OR YOU CAN SYNC YOUR CHAT WITH DISCORD AS WELL. SO NOW THAT YOU'RE ALL SET UP TO LIVE STREAM TO MULTIPLE PLATFORMS WITH TWICE THE POTENTIAL AUDIENCE,
YOU1000000020_S0000026	YOU ARE WELCOME TO OUR LIVE EXCLUSIVE COVERAGE OF THE FINAL OF PRO TOUR BORN OF THE GODS. WILL IT BE THE ICE COOL SEAN MCLAREN OR 18 YEAR OLD JACOB WILSON
YOU1000000020_S0000027	IF HE WINS THIS MATCH, JACOB WILL BE THE FIRST CHAMPION YOUNGER THAN THE GAME OF MAGIC.
YOU1000000020_S0000029	JACOB HASN'T ATTACKED EVEN ONCE.
YOU1000000020_S0000031	JACOB REALLY NEEDS TO NOT PLAY THE HARMONICS OVER HERE.
YOU1000000020_S0000033	SEAN MCLAREN. IS IT STATICASTER?
YOU1000000020_S0000035	YOUR BIRDS OF PARADISE, AND THAT IS THE END. SEAN MCLAREN IS YOUR CHAMPION. HE IS KING OF THE HILL.
YOU1000000020_S0000037	JACOB, CONGRATULATIONS. I CAN TELL OF COURSE YOU'RE DISAPPOINTED. WHO WOULDN'T BE?
YOU1000000020_S0000039	YEP, WE'LL COME BACK, WIN THE NEXT ONE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOUR FINALIST, A GREAT AMBASSADOR FOR THE GAME, JACOB WILSON. GOOD JOB.
YOU1000000020_S0000046	THIS IS AN IMPORTANT TOURNAMENT FOR JACOB IN A BIG WAY. HE HAD A BITTER LOSS IN HIS FIRST PRO TOUR. I REMEMBER LOOKING AT HIM AFTER THAT HAPPENED
YOU1000000020_S0000051	I THINK THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TIME WE SAW JACOB. LIKE, YOU KNOW, HE HAS THIS KIND OF, LIKE, FLAT EXTERIOR WHEN HE'S PLAYING MAGIC.
YOU1000000020_S0000054	IMMEDIATELY AFTER, I WAS PRETTY DEVASTATED AND DEFINITELY BITTER. I'M JACOB WILSON, AND I'M A PROFESSIONAL MAGIC LAIR.
YOU1000000020_S0000084	WE ALWAYS HAD A FANTASY BACKGROUND, STARTING FROM MY OLDEST BROTHER, WHICH READ A LOT OF TOLKIEN'S WORK. WE ALL READ CHRONICLES OF NARNIA.
YOU1000000020_S0000088	SPECIFICALLY WHY THIS SAVANNAH LION IS KEPT IN PLASTIC IS THAT IT ACTUALLY SINGLE HANDEDLY WON RALPH'S BETA BLACK LOAD.
YOU1000000020_S0000133	JACOB WILSON ATTACKING FOR LETHAL USING PATH TO EXILE. JUST SAW A HANDSHAKE.
YOU1000000020_S0000136	OH, HE FINALLY SLOGGED THROUGH! HOW DO YOU BEAT THAT? SO JACOB WILSON MOVES ON.
YOU1000000020_S0000141	WE'RE HOLDING WHITE BITS OF PAPER AND THAT MEANS IT'S TIME FOR THE END OF DAY WRAP. JACOB WILSON IS AHEAD OF THE CURVE.
YOU1000000020_S0000142	YOU'VE ALREADY CALLED IT, THOUGH. YOU'RE SAYING JACOB WILSON FOR THE WIN.
YOU1000000020_S0000163	MY OPPONENT RIGHT NOW IS GREG FETTIN. HE'S VERY WELL KNOWN IN THE VINTAGE COMMUNITY. WE PUT OUT SOME REALLY GOOD PLAYERS FROM HERE.
YOU1000000020_S0000174	I'D SAY THE FARINOS ARE THE GODFATHERS, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE DO REGARD THEM AS THE CREATORS OF THESE CERTAIN DECKS.
YOU1000000020_S0000183	JACOB WILSON HAS BEEN UTTERLY DOMINANT THIS WEEKEND, BUT HE JUST SUFFERED A BRUTAL LOSS IN THE HANDS OF ERIC FROEHLICH. AND IF HE DOESN'T MAKE THE TOP EIGHT, THAT LAST PLAY IS GOING TO COME BACK TO HAUNT HIM.
YOU1000000020_S0000186	HERE WE ARE, IT'S THE LAST ROUND OF THE DAY. IT ALL COMES DOWN TO THIS. IF JACOB WILSON WINS, HE ADVANCES TO THE FINAL DAY. IF HE LOSES, HE IS DONE.
YOU1000000020_S0000187	OUR FIRST PLAYER, SETH MANFIELD. STANDING IN HIS WAY, JACOB WILSON.
YOU1000000020_S0000189	ALL RIGHT, HERE'S LAVA SPIKE TO TAKE JACOB WILSON DOWN TO 10
YOU1000000020_S0000191	DOWN TO TWO IS JACOB.
YOU1000000020_S0000193	JACOB'S TURNING THE TABLES AND GOING ON THE OFFENSIVE HERE. HE'S GOT HIS GUNS BLAZING AGAINST SETH, AND SETH HAS FALLEN TO SIX.
YOU1000000020_S0000196	THAT'S GAME. SIEGE RHINO. THAT'S GONNA DO IT. JACOB WILSON HAS WON.
YOU1000000020_S0000198	HOW DO YOU FEEL AS SETH MANFIELD RIGHT NOW?
YOU1000000020_S0000203	SO JACOB WAS ABOUT TO DIE TO A LETHAL BARRAGE OF BURN SPELLS AND THEN CAST A SINGLE COPY OF THE WHITE LEY LINE TO PROTECT HIMSELF.
YOU1000000020_S0000205	FROM CANADA, JACOB WILSON.
YOU1000000020_S0000209	HELLO AND WELCOME TO THE LAST QUARTERFINAL OF PRO TOUR FAKER FORGE. WE ARE GOING TO START OFF WITH JELGUR VYGZMA AGAINST JACOB WILSON, A 19 YEAR OLD,
YOU1000000020_S0000211	LET'S GET RIGHT DOWN TO THE FLOOR AND SEE WHO IS GOING TO WIN BETWEEN YELGER VIGISHMA AND JACOB WILSON.
YOU1000000020_S0000213	THE UGGERS HAND HAS EVERYTHING.
YOU1000000020_S0000215	JACOB IS IN GAME THREE, AND A TWO OUT OF THREE AGAINST
YOU1000000020_S0000216	JELGER WIEGERSMA, WHO IS A DUTCH HALL OF FAME MAGIC PLAYER, SO NOT AN EASY OPPONENT.
YOU1000000020_S0000218	GAME ONE, JELGAR HAD AN INSTANT WIN COMBO THAT INVOLVED MAKING AN INFINITE NUMBER OF FAIRIES THAT ALL ATTACK AT ONCE FOR INFINITE DAMAGE.
YOU1000000020_S0000219	AND THEN IN GAME TWO, JACOB WAS ABLE TO SURVIVE DESPITE THE FACT THAT YELGAR REIGNED IN ANGER OF THE GODS THAT DESTROYED ALL OF JACOB'S CREATURES.
YOU1000000020_S0000220	BUT THEN JACOB SUMMONED AN ELEPHANT SOLDIER CALLED LOXODON SMITER THAT FINISHED THE JOB AND KILLED JELGAR IN GAME TWO. SO NOW WE'RE ON TO GAME THREE.
YOU1000000020_S0000221	JACOB'S GOT A VERY GOOD START, BUT JELGER'S DECK IS CAPABLE OF WINNING IN AN EYE BLINK, SO THE SUSPENSE IS PRETTY GOOD.
YOU1000000020_S0000223	VOICE OF RESURGENCE. HE'S RUNNING THROUGH. WHAT COULD HE HAVE? JACOB DOES NOT HAVE A LOT OF OUTS HERE. THINGS ARE NOT LOOKING GOOD FOR HIM.
YOU1000000020_S0000225	I'M GONNA PUT THIS SPLINTER TWIN ON THIS PESTERMITE. DO YOU HAVE A RESPONSE? SHOWS THE PATH TO EXILE TO JELGAR, WHO NOW WILL SHOW HIM THE DISPEL.
YOU1000000020_S0000228	THE GAME. THERE'S THE HAND. JELGER VIGAJIMA ADVANCES TO THE SEMIFINALS OVER JACOB WILSON.
YOU1000000020_S0000230	ANOTHER GREAT PERFORMANCE FROM YOUNG JACOB WILSON, BUT IT WASN'T QUITE ENOUGH AGAINST THE DUTCH HALL OF FAMER. I KNOW THIS HAS TO BE SO DISAPPOINTING FOR HIM.
YOU1000000020_S0000232	YOU'RE GRADED ON HOW MANY TOP EIGHTS YOU'VE ACHIEVED. I THINK THAT ULTIMATELY, JACOB IS GOING TO EMBRACE THAT FACT
YOU1000000020_S0000254	SEASON ONE, INVITATIONAL IN RICHMOND. I'M HERE WITH OUR CHAMPION, JACOB WILSON. CONGRATULATIONS, MAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WITH A HANDSHAKE, COMES A LITTLE BIT OF HARDWARE. YOU'RE NO STRANGER TO THIS.
YOU1000000023_S0000002	FIRE EMBLEM IS TURNING 30 NEXT YEAR, AND WITH 16 MAIN GAMES AND A FEW SPIN OFFS, IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT IT HAS GROWN INTO SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY. THE GAMES ARE PACKED WITH DEEP STORYLINES AND MEMORABLE CHARACTERS LIKE MARTH.
YOU1000000023_S0000003	THAT'S NOT MARTH? MARTH. THAT'S... WHICH ONE IS MARTH?
YOU1000000023_S0000005	MARTH.
YOU1000000023_S0000022	THAT WAY THE AUDIENCE COULD BE LIKE, AH, THAT DUDE'S WEARING A TIGHT FITTING SUIT WITH A BUNCH OF WEIRD PATCHES, THAT MUST BE ARLECCHINO, THE SERVANT CLOWN SOMETIMES TO TWO MASTERS! THIS BROUGHT THE AUDIENCE IN IMMEDIATELY. THEY KNEW WHAT THAT CHARACTER WAS ABOUT WITHOUT ANY EXPOSITION.
YOU1000000023_S0000027	CAIN AND ABEL ARE BATTLE BROS. THEY FIGHT TOGETHER, BUT NOT IN THE BIBLICAL SENSE. BORDEN CHORDS ARE SIMILAR, EXCEPT THEY'RE USUALLY AXE FIGHTERS. PEGASUS SISTERS ARE A TRIO OF FLYING HORSES LADIES.
YOU1000000023_S0000028	YOU CAN'T SPLIT THESE ARCHETYPES UP INTO THEIR SOLO CHARACTERS BECAUSE THEIR BOND IS WHAT DEFINES THEM. YOU CAN'T HAVE A WALUIGI WITHOUT A LUIGI. AND IN THE SAME WAY, YOU CAN'T HAVE A BOARD WITHOUT A CORD. WHICH IS MY FAVORITE DR. SEUSS BOOK.
YOU1000000023_S0000029	JÄGENS ARE MENTORS THAT ARE STRONG AT THE BEGINNING, AND THEN YOU'LL QUICKLY OUTPACE THEM, AND IT'S KIND OF SAD, LIKE THE FIRST TIME YOU BEAT YOUR DAD IN A BASKETBALL GAME. OIFES ARE SIMILAR TO JÄGENS, EXCEPT THEY'LL KEEP DUNKING ON YOU TILL YOU'RE DEAD.
YOU1000000023_S0000030	WENDELS ARE MENTORS BUT FOR MAGIC, GOTOHS ARE MENTORS BUT ONLY THE LAST HALF OF THE GAME. BEOWULFS ARE MERCENARIES THAT YOU HAVE TO PAY ACTUAL IN GAME CURRENCY TO RECRUIT, AND OGMAS ARE MERCENARIES THAT USUALLY DECIDE TO JOIN YOU OUT OF THEIR OWN VOLITION,
YOU1000000023_S0000034	YOU CAN'T GET THE OTHER. KIND OF LIKE IF TWO OF YOUR FRIENDS START DATING AND THEN HAVE A REALLY MESSY BREAKUP. CORNELIUSES ARE USUALLY THE PARENTAL FIGURE TO THE MAIN CHARACTER, AND THEY HAVE THIS NASTY HABIT OF GETTING AXED SUPER EARLY ON IN THE GAME.
YOU1000000023_S0000035	IT'S KIND OF LIKE FIRE EMBLEM DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE INTERESTING CHARACTERS WITHOUT MAKING THEM SUFFER TRAUMATIC PARENTAL DEATH.
YOU1000000023_S0000049	BUT BEFORE I GET THERE, I JUST WANT TO COMMEND FIRE EMBLEM FOR HAVING 596 PLAYABLE CHARACTERS AND ONLY REPEATING THREE NAMES. WHEN I WAS HIRED FOR MY FIRST JOB AT A CLIMBING GYM, I WAS ONE OF FIVE EMPLOYEES NAMED BRIAN.
YOU1000000023_S0000054	THAT TOOK LIKE 30 MINUTES. BUT LET'S BEGIN. THE HONORABLE KNIGHT, LIKE FIONA, WHO CARES PASSIONATELY ABOUT HER PEOPLE AND WILL ALWAYS OPPOSE CRUELTY TO CIVILIANS,
YOU1000000023_S0000055	WHICH IS WAY BETTER THAN THE LOYAL KNIGHT LIKE TRUDE, WHO ONLY IS LOYAL TO PERN AND WILL DO LITERALLY ANYTHING FOR HIM EVEN THOUGH PERN IS A BAD DUDE, BUT I'LL GET TO THAT LATER.
YOU1000000023_S0000059	BUT THAT'S NOT MY FAULT. SUPER SMASH SHOULD HAVE INCLUDED MORE MAGIC BABIES. ARROGANCE, HOTHEADS, AND EDGELORDS ALL HAVE A MEAN SIDE, BUT ARROGANCE LIKE VIKEY JUST THINK THEY'RE THE BEST, HOTHEADS LIKE KASPAR WANT TO FIGHT ANYTHING THAT MOVES,
YOU1000000023_S0000060	AND EDGELORDS LIKE NILES RETWEET JOKER ACCOUNTS UNIRONICALLY. A LOT OF THESE CHARACTERS HAVE ROUGH CHILDHOODS, BUT THEN TURN OUT CHEERFUL DESPITE THAT. AND THEN THERE'S THE INFERIORITY COMPLEX ARCHETYPE, WHICH I COULD HAVE JUST CALLED THE MAJORITY OF CHILDREN IN FIRE EMBLEM FATES.
YOU1000000023_S0000061	PERFECTIONISTS, MISCHIEF MAKERS, AND FLIRTS ARE ALL HIGHLY MOTIVATED, BUT TSUBAKI IS MOTIVATED TO MEET HIGH EXPECTATIONS, CLAUDE IS MOTIVATED TO MAKE INTRICATE SCHEMES, AND SYLVAIN IS MOTIVATED TO BE A FUCKBOY.
YOU1000000023_S0000062	BUZZKILLS ARE JUST CHARACTERS THAT AREN'T VERY FUN TO TALK TO, AND FIRE EMBLEM, I WILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU FOR NAMING AN UNEMOTIONAL, UBER RELIGIOUS, DEADBEAT DAD GILBERT. IT ALSO DOESN'T HELP THAT I LOOK LIKE HANUMAN LIGHT.
YOU1000000023_S0000064	OH GOD, AM I A BUZZKILL? A LOT OF THESE ARCHETYPES ARE BASED AROUND ONE SINGULAR PERSONALITY TRAIT. SCARLET'S STRAIGHTFORWARD, VALBAR'S CHILL, LINHART'S LAZY, SUMIA'S CLUMSY, PETRA'S A SWEETIE, AND RANDOLPH IS A FURRY.
YOU1000000023_S0000066	CHILD SOLDIER. KAREN IS CANONICALLY 14 YEARS OLD.
YOU1000000023_S0000069	MANUELA IS CONSTANTLY DRINKING AND FLIRTING AND JUST BEING A HOT MESS, AND I LOVE HER FOR IT, AND THAT MAKES HER THE PRESIDENT OF VICES.
YOU1000000023_S0000070	THE VICE PRESIDENT. BUT BE CAREFUL NOT TO DO THAT AROUND SOMEONE LIKE ASTRUM, WHO IS CONSTANTLY ACCUSING PEOPLE OF TREASON FOR NO GOOD REASON.
YOU1000000023_S0000072	HERE'S AN ARCHETYPE I CALL WHAT THE FUCK, AND IT'S THE THREE CHARACTERS THAT MAKE ME SAY, WHAT THE FUCK, FIRE EMBLEM. PEOPLE LIKE PERN, WHO IS SAID TO BE A SWEET ROBIN HOOD TYPE, EXCEPT HE DOES KIDNAP A YOUNG GIRL AND KEEPS HER AS HIS SLAVE.
YOU1000000023_S0000073	OR THARJA, WHO PRACTICES CURSES ON HER OWN DAUGHTER. OR ROGER, WHO IS ACTUALLY... HE'S NOT ACTUALLY THAT BAD.
YOU1000000023_S0000074	BUT FIRE EMBLEM DOES GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO MAKE HIS END SCREEN SAY THAT HE NEVER GETS A DATE AND HE STAYS SINGLE FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE. AND IT'S LIKE, WHAT THE FUCK, FIRE EMBLEM? YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO HIM DIRTY LIKE THAT.
YOU1000000023_S0000075	THE NEXT ARCHETYPE IS CALLED ACTUALLY PRETTY INTERESTING. THESE CHARACTERS ARE THREE DIMENSIONAL AND WELL DEVELOPED. PEOPLE LIKE LIBRA, WHO STRUGGLES WITH HIS FAITH AND HAS INCREDIBLE SELF DOUBT EVEN THOUGH HE'S DOING ALL HE CAN TO HELP THOSE AROUND HIM.
YOU1000000023_S0000076	OR RHYS, WHO DREAMS OF BEING A SWORDFIGHTER, BUT HIS WEAK CONSTITUTION WON'T ALLOW HIM TO BECOME ONE. AND SO HE HELPS IN THE WAYS HE CAN, BUT HIS WHOLE STORY IS ONE OF UNFULFILLED DREAMS.
YOU1000000023_S0000078	AND THAT'S IT. THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO INTERESTING CHARACTERS IN FIRE EMBLEM. UNTIL WE GET TO RAPHAEL, MY SWEET BULKY BOY WHO ONLY CARES ABOUT EATING AND TRAINING AND NOT ABOUT STUDYING.
YOU1000000023_S0000094	AND THAT JUST SOUNDS LIKE A PRETTY RUN OF THE MILL AWKWARD FAMILY REUNION. AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, THESE ONES ARE JUST, THEY'RE STRANGE CHARACTERS THAT HAVE, THAT ARE GOOD AT FIGHTING. I MEAN, IF YOU INCLUDE DIMITRI IN THIS, HE HAS AN EYE PATCH.
YOU1000000023_S0000095	WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THESE ONES. SETTETH AND BYLETH HAVE THE, THEY RHYME. WE ALSO, I MEAN. DOROTHEA WEARS A HAT UNTIL SHE GROWS OUT OF THE HAT. THINK ABOUT THAT. DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON OBORO.
YOU1000000023_S0000101	YOU KNOW THE SERVANT CLOWN SOMETIMES DID YOU MASTERS
YOU1000000023_S0000106	OKAY.
YOU1000000029_S0000001	THE POLLS HAVE CLOSED IN THREE MORE STATES AT 7.30 IN THE EAST. AT THIS POINT, BILL CLINTON HAS 58 ELECTORAL VOTES. BOB DOLE, NOTHING YET.
YOU1000000029_S0000003	CNN COVERAGE OF ELECTION 96. LIVE FROM CNN CENTER, HERE ARE JUDY WOODRUFF, BERNARD SHAW, BILL SNYDER, AND KEN BODE.
YOU1000000029_S0000005	AND THE BIGGEST ELECTORAL PRIZE AT THIS HALF HOUR, WE CAN TELL YOU, IS THE STATE OF OHIO. CNN CALLS THAT THE STATE OF OHIO HAS BEEN WON BY PRESIDENT CLINTON. THIS IS A BIG VICTORY, KEN BODE, FOR THE DEMOCRATS.
YOU1000000029_S0000007	CNN DECLARES THAT BILL CLINTON HAS WON WEST VIRGINIA'S FIVE ELECTORAL VOTES.
YOU1000000029_S0000010	JUDY, THIS IS FAIRLY TYPICAL FOR NORTH CAROLINA. THIS IS A GENERALLY REPUBLICAN STATE IN PRESIDENTIAL RACES, BUT GEORGE BUSH WON THIS STATE BY LESS THAN 1% LAST TIME, HIS VERY CLOSEST STATE.
YOU1000000029_S0000019	NOW LET'S MOVE OVER TO THE ELECTORAL MAP TO SHOW YOU WHAT WE HAVE SO FAR. PRESIDENT CLINTON LEADING BOB DOLE, 58 ELECTORAL VOTES. THE MAGIC NUMBER IS 270.
YOU1000000029_S0000023	OHIO IN THIS HALF HOUR, FLORIDA BEFORE THAT. THOSE ARE TWO BIG STATES AND BOTH IN THE CLINTON COLUMN.
YOU1000000029_S0000025	SO WHAT WE HAVE IS THE REPUBLICANS IN A LITTLE BIT OF DIFFICULTY HERE. MR. DOLE.
YOU1000000029_S0000027	WELL, KENTUCKY AND INDIANA IS FASCINATING. JUST FASCINATING. AND THE WORD WAS THAT IF DOLE STARTED OUT IN TROUBLE IN KENTUCKY AND INDIANA, IF HE LOST THEM OUTRIGHT, THE NIGHT WOULD BE OVER.
YOU1000000029_S0000030	BUT IN JUNE, HE SAID IF BOB DOLE, HE CALLS HIMSELF BOB DOLE, HE SAYS IF BOB DOLE DOESN'T WIN KENTUCKY, BOB DOLE CAN'T WIN THE PRESIDENCY. WELL, WE DON'T KNOW YET, BUT IT'S A TIGHT ONE.
YOU1000000029_S0000031	THAT'S RIGHT. LET'S TAKE A LOOK NOW AT THE STATES THAT WE KNOW ONE OR THE OTHER HAS WON. AND HERE IT IS FOR PRESIDENT CLINTON, FLORIDA. YOU'VE BEEN HEARING THIS. NEW HAMPSHIRE, OHIO, VERMONT, AND WEST VIRGINIA.
YOU1000000029_S0000036	BILL SCHNEIDER, YOU WANT TO TAKE OVER WITH THE EXIT POLLS HERE, AND I'LL SAVE A THOUGHT I HAD.
YOU1000000029_S0000037	OKAY, WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE STATE OF OHIO, A BIG WIN FOR BILL CLINTON, AND SEE HOW DID HE DO IT. WELL, ONE THIRD OF THE VOTERS IN OHIO WERE UNION MEMBERS IN THE HOUSEHOLD.
YOU1000000029_S0000038	AND THEY CLEARLY WENT A MAJORITY, A SOLID MAJORITY FOR BILL CLINTON. THAT BIG AFL CIO PUSH FOR THE DEMOCRATS AND FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT PAID OFF IN OHIO.
YOU1000000029_S0000040	NOW, LET'S LOOK AT THE VOTERS WHO DECIDED HOW THEY WERE GOING TO VOTE JUST IN THE LAST THREE DAYS. HOW DID THEY END UP VOTING? WELL, THEY VOTED FOR BOB DOLE. IT LOOKS LIKE DOLE TALKED ABOUT HIS MOMENTUM IN THE LAST FEW DAYS.
YOU1000000029_S0000042	THEY WERE THE ONES WHO DELIVERED FOR BILL CLINTON, AND THAT WAS 70% OF THE VOTERS IN OHIO. SO WHILE DOLE PICKED UP SOME LATE MOMENTUM,
YOU1000000029_S0000044	YOU ARE VERY GOOD WITH THAT, JOHN MADDEN. I OUGHT TO BE JEALOUS TONIGHT.
YOU1000000029_S0000048	LIVE FROM WASHINGTON, CROSSFIRE. ON THE LEFT, GERALDINE FERRARO. ON THE RIGHT, ROBERT NOVAK. IN THE CROSSFIRE.
YOU1000000029_S0000049	REPUBLICAN SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN OF ARIZONA, ADVISOR TO THE DOLE KEMP CAMPAIGN. AND IN NEW ORLEANS, DEMOCRATIC SENATOR JOHN BROE.
YOU1000000029_S0000051	GOOD EVENING. WELCOME TO CROSSFIRE. FINALLY, ELECTION DAY CAME WITH BILL CLINTON CASTING HIS VOTE IN THE RENOVATED TRAIN STATION AT LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS, AND BOB DOLE VOTING AT THE FIRST CHRISTIAN CHURCH IN RUSSELL, KANSAS.
YOU1000000029_S0000052	THE OTHER MILLIONS OF AMERICANS VOTING TODAY DECIDED 35 SENATE CONTESTS AND 435 HOUSE RACES, AS WELL AS THE PRESIDENCY. PRESIDENT CLINTON IS HEAVILY FAVORED FOR A SECOND TERM
YOU1000000029_S0000053	AND THE BIG QUESTION IS, WHO CONTROLS CONGRESS? WHAT THE REPUBLICANS NARROWLY FAVOR. JERRY?
YOU1000000029_S0000057	TALKING ABOUT. WE'VE HAD OHIO THAT HAS GONE FOR CLINTON. WE HAVE KENTUCKY, WHICH ALSO WAS A MUST WIN STATE TOO CLOSE TO CALL.
YOU1000000029_S0000058	YOU SEE THAT FLORIDA HAS GONE TO PRESIDENT CLINTON. IF DOLE IS IN TROUBLE IN THE SOUTH, DO YOU SEE ANY SCENARIO BY WHICH HE COULD WIN THIS PRESIDENCY TONIGHT?
YOU1000000029_S0000059	WELL, JERRY, AS I MENTIONED BEFORE WE WENT ON, I JUST CAME OFF OF THE 96 HOUR TRIP WITH SENATOR DOLE. WE SAW ENTHUSIASM EVERY PLACE WE WENT. I THINK THAT CALIFORNIA IS STILL IN PLAY.
YOU1000000029_S0000060	I THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF SOUTHERN STATES THAT WENT FOR PRESIDENT CLINTON LAST TIME, AND I CERTAINLY THINK THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY BE, QUOTE, UNDECIDED, I STILL BELIEVE KENTUCKY AND INDIANA, FOR EXAMPLE, WILL GO.
YOU1000000029_S0000061	FOR SENATOR DOLE, BUT I DON'T DISCOUNT THE IMPORTANCE OF FLORIDA AND OHIO. THEY'RE IMPORTANT STATES.
YOU1000000029_S0000062	SO THAT WITH ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL, IF THIS TREND CONTINUES, SENATOR DOLE WILL STAY IN WASHINGTON OR GO BACK TO KANSAS BUT NOT BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
YOU1000000029_S0000067	MY FEELING IS THAT WE PICK UP LIKE ONE SEAT. I'M SURE THAT JOHN BREAUX MAY HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW. BUT I THINK WE'D PICK UP THE FOUR SOUTHERN OPEN DEMOCRAT SEATS.
YOU1000000029_S0000069	SENATOR JOHN BURROW, THIS IS VERY GOOD NEWS FOR PRESIDENT CLINTON, BUT I WONDER IF YOU'RE POPPING CHAMPAGNE CORKS YET.
YOU1000000029_S0000072	BOB, YOU MUST BE STRUGGLING. THIS IS DEVASTATING NEWS FOR SENATOR DOLE IN A SENSE WHEN YOU DON'T NOT CARRY OHIO, WHICH EVERY REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT HAS ALWAYS CARRIED, AND YOU LOSE FLORIDA. THAT'S VERY BAD NEWS FOR SENATOR DOLE.
YOU1000000029_S0000073	AS FAR AS WINNING AN ELECTORAL VICTORY. AND WE'RE NOT FINISHED VOTING HERE IN LOUISIANA. WE GOT ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF LEFT. AND I'M VERY CONFIDENT THAT MARY LANDRIEU WILL BE VICTORIOUS.
YOU1000000029_S0000074	I THINK I WOULD AGREE WITH JOHN MCCAIN, MY FRIEND, THAT THE SENATE IS GOING TO BE VERY CLOSE. I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF IT WAS 51 49 EITHER WAY.
YOU1000000029_S0000076	BUT I JUST WOULD LIKE YOU TO ADDRESS MY INITIAL QUESTION, SENATOR, ON HOW YOU CAN SQUARE THE APPARENT BIG VICTORY OF PRESIDENT CLINTON
YOU1000000029_S0000079	BECAUSE OF WHAT HE SAYS OR SHE SAYS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE STATES. IT'S NOT THAT CONNECTED TO THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. I THINK YOU CAN HAVE PEOPLE VOTING FOR PRESIDENT CLINTON AND PERHAPS VOTING FOR A REPUBLICAN SENATOR.
YOU1000000029_S0000081	WELL, ISN'T IT TRUE THAT THE PROBLEM IS THAT SOME OF YOUR CANDIDATES IN THE SOUTH, LIKE MARY LANDRIEU IN LOUISIANA AND MAX CLELAND IN GEORGIA, WERE ELECTION YEAR MODERATES? THEY'VE BEEN LIBERALS ALL THEIR LIFE, AND PERHAPS THE VOTERS SAW THROUGH THEM?
YOU1000000029_S0000082	BOB, IT'S REALLY INTERESTING. THEY CHARGING MARY LANDRIEU WITH BEING A LIBERAL. HERE'S A PERSON WHO SUPPORTS THE DEATH PENALTY, SUPPORTS CARRYING CONCEALED WEAPONS IN LOUISIANA, AND ALSO WILL SUPPORT A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO BALANCE THE BUDGET. THAT DOESN'T SOUND VERY LIBERAL TO ME.
YOU1000000029_S0000088	BOB, THERE YOU GO AGAIN FALLING FOR SOME OF THE REPUBLICAN RHETORIC. SHE CLEARLY HAS SAID THAT SHE WOULD HAVE VOTED JUST LIKE ME AND BENNETT JOHNSON ON THAT ISSUE, BUT HER OPPONENT AND OTHERS KEEP SAYING, WELL, THAT'S NOT HER POSITION. THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID VERY CLEARLY.
YOU1000000029_S0000092	CROSSFIRE IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY LCI INTERNATIONAL, A VERY DIFFERENT LONG DISTANCE PHONE COMPANY. AND BY CHRYSLER AND THE CAB FORWARD SEDAN OF CHRYSLER. WHAT'S NEW IN YOUR WORLD?
YOU1000000029_S0000094	WELCOME BACK TO CROSSFIRE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ELECTION 96 WITH SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN, REPUBLICAN OF ARIZONA AND ADULT ADVISOR. IN NEW ORLEANS, SENATOR JOHN BREAUX, DEMOCRAT OF LOUISIANA.
YOU1000000029_S0000097	ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO GO AFTER THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION AGAIN FOR ANOTHER FOUR YEARS, OR ARE YOU GOING TO GET DOWN TO SOME SERIOUS WORK IN THE SENATE FOR A CHANGE?
YOU1000000029_S0000098	JERRY, COULD I MENTION WHAT, REAL QUICK BEFORE I ANSWER, AND THAT IS THAT WE ARE PLEASED TO SEE THE CLOSURE IN THE POPULAR VOTE. AS YOU KNOW, MANY OF THE POLLS LIKE ABC HAD PRESIDENT CLINTON BY 16 AND THE TEENS AND
YOU1000000029_S0000102	WE JUST SAW ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE NEW YORK TIMES TODAY MR. RIOTTI HAD, WHAT, 12 VISITS?
YOU1000000029_S0000107	WELL, WHAT I HOPE IS THAT WE HAVE A HOWARD BAKER ON THE DEMOCRAT SIDE, AS THEY DID DURING WATERGATE. A BIPARTISAN DEMOCRAT WILL SAY, LOOK, WE'VE GOT TO LOOK INTO THIS AND WE'VE GOT TO GO AT IT IN A
YOU1000000029_S0000110	I'LL TAKE YOU UP ON THAT. JOHN BURROW, ARE YOU READY TO PLAY THE ROLE OF HOWARD BAKER AND ASK BILL CLINTON WHAT DID HE KNOW AND WHEN DID HE KNOW IT ABOUT THIS LAUNDERED MONEY FROM INDONESIA?
YOU1000000029_S0000111	BOB, THE PROBLEM IS BIPARTISAN. IT'S A BIPARTISAN PROBLEM. JUST YESTERDAY, ONE PERSON WHO WAS A SUPPORTER AND WORKED FOR THE DOLE CAMPAIGN CONFESSED TO MAKING A $120,000 ILLEGAL CONTRIBUTION.
YOU1000000029_S0000112	I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT US TO LOOK AT SOME NEW CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM. JOHN MCCAIN, I THINK, IS A LEADER ON THIS ISSUE ALONG WITH OUR DEMOCRATIC SIDE. THAT'S WHAT I THINK THE PEOPLE WANT. THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE WE DO IT RIGHT IN THE FUTURE.
YOU1000000029_S0000116	WELL, JOHN, AS A REALISTIC LOUISIANA POLITICIAN, AND YOU'RE ONE OF THE BEST OF THEM, WOULD YOU AGREE WITH ME THAT A LOT IS AT STAKE TONIGHT FOR THE PRESIDENT?
YOU1000000035_S0000003	ONE BEING THE FEARED AND IMMENSE KANGOL.
YOU1000000035_S0000016	TODAY, I'M VISITING CARL WESTFIELD IN THE UK, WHO IS GUARDIAN OF SEVERAL KANGALS.
YOU1000000035_S0000017	AND ALSO ONE OF THE UK'S TOP KANGAL EXPERTS, SHEILA REID. IN ORDER TO FIND OUT JUST WHAT THE TEMPERAMENT IS,
YOU1000000035_S0000020	MY CAR.
YOU1000000035_S0000021	OH, HI, ANNIKA.
YOU1000000035_S0000025	THIS IS DAVE HERE.
YOU1000000035_S0000026	STAY.
YOU1000000035_S0000027	YES, THIS IS DAVE.
YOU1000000035_S0000033	THIS IS DAVE AND KAJAZ.
YOU1000000035_S0000034	THAT'S A PRETTY NAME.
YOU1000000035_S0000035	I MET CARL'S TWO KANGALS AND THE FIRST THING THAT HIT ME WAS HOW LOVELY THEY WERE. REALLY AFFECTIONATE AND WELCOMING OF STRANGERS.
YOU1000000035_S0000036	DAVE, HIS MALE KANGAL, JUST WANTED TO BE PETTED AND LOVED TO ROLL OVER AND FALL DOWN IN MY LAP.
YOU1000000035_S0000037	THE TWO DOGS HAD AN OBVIOUS ROVING CURIOSITY, AND CARL MENTIONED THAT HE PREFERRED TO KEEP THEM LEASHED
YOU1000000035_S0000040	WELL, CARL, THESE ARE BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL DOGS. IT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER MET A KANGAL DOG. YOU GET THIS SORT OF IDEA WHEN PEOPLE GO ON ABOUT THEM BEING,
YOU1000000035_S0000043	A GOOD KANGA IS COMPLETELY SOLID TEMPERAMENT, BASICALLY CALM UNTIL ROUSED.
YOU1000000035_S0000059	LET'S JUST QUICKLY TALK ABOUT DAVE'S EARS HERE BECAUSE I KNOW PEOPLE COMMENT A LOT ABOUT CROPPED EARS.
YOU1000000035_S0000061	WHEN THEY'VE BEEN VERY, VERY YOUNG. AND OF COURSE, LITTLE DAVE HERE IS AN IMPORT. SO HE'S NOT BEING CROPPED HERE IN THE UK.
YOU1000000035_S0000062	AND CARL CERTAINLY DOESN'T PROP ANY OF THE EARS. AND OF COURSE, AS YOU CAN SEE HERE ON THE FEMALE, THIS IS WHAT THEIR EARS ARE SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE.
YOU1000000035_S0000090	IS FAWN WITH A BLACK MASK.
YOU1000000035_S0000115	LATER THAT WEEK I DROPPED BY TO MEET A VERY SPECIAL LADY INDEED, SHEILA REID, RESPECTED ACROSS THE UK FOR HER EXPERTISE IN THE KANGAL BREED.
YOU1000000035_S0000116	BOTH HER AND HER HUSBAND MICHAEL HAD KEPT KANGALS FOR DECADES NOW AND HAD TRAVELED OUT TO TURKEY MANY TIMES TO SOURCE DOGS FROM WORKING LINES.
YOU1000000035_S0000120	OUR OLD DOG HAD DIED AND WE JUST WANTED, WE WANTED A NATURAL DOG. WE WENT TO SEE A LADY CALLED MRS. BETTY MARSHALL.
YOU1000000035_S0000121	AND SHE BROUGHT OUT HER DOG CALLED FENNE. HE STOOD ON HIS BACK LEGS AND HE PUT HIS PAWS ON MY SHOULDERS.
YOU1000000035_S0000187	I WAS DEEPLY MOVED BY SHEILA'S STORIES AND FOUND OUT INFORMATION I DID NOT PREVIOUSLY KNOW, SUCH AS THERE BEING VARYING TYPES OF KANGOL,
YOU1000000035_S0000197	SHEILA ALSO NICELY CLEARED UP THE KANGAL VERSUS ANATOLIAN SHEPHERD DEBATE AND EXPLAINED WHY THESE TWO DOG BREEDS ARE CERTAINLY NOT THE SAME.
YOU1000000035_S0000206	IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT KANGALS, YOU CAN CONTACT CARL VIA HIS WEBPAGE.
YOU1000000038_S0000001	THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. I'M SPENCER TILLIS.
YOU1000000038_S0000002	AND I'M GISELLE ESPINALES.
YOU1000000038_S0000012	AND I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF RAVENS HEAD COACH JOHN HARBAUGH HAD HIS OWN FANTASY FOOTBALL DRAFT. REGULAR SEASON IS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER. WE'LL LET YOU KNOW OUR PICKS.
YOU1000000038_S0000021	SPENCER, YOU KNOW THE LIONS ARE ONE OF THE TEAMS THAT EVERY OTHER TEAM IN THE BAYSIDE NORTH DIVISION ACTUALLY CIRCLES ON THEIR CALENDAR, SO THEY MEAN BUSINESS.
YOU1000000038_S0000026	AND WHAT I REALLY WAS IMPRESSED WITH WAS BRADLEY, HOW CALM AND COMPOSED HE WAS THROUGHOUT THAT INTERVIEW AND THROUGHOUT THE GAME.
YOU1000000038_S0000043	AND THE FACT IS, I MEAN, STEVEN DECATUR, THAT IS, THEY HAD GUYS THAT THEY WERE HANDING THE BALL OFF TO RUNNING HARD DOWNHILL. AND THEY ALSO HAD A GUY THAT WAS ABOUT 250 POUNDS, AND HE WAS LAYING GUYS OUT. I MEAN, HE WAS PICKING UP YARDS. YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT FALLING FORWARD TO GET THE FIRST DOWN.
YOU1000000038_S0000044	HE WAS DEFINITELY GETTING THAT DONE OUT THERE FROM GISELLE. AND I FEEL LIKE MOVING FORWARD, THEY GOT A GOOD THING GOING THERE. IT'S ALWAYS NICE WHEN YOU GOT A COUPLE GUYS YOU CAN HAND THE BALL TO.
YOU1000000038_S0000047	AND AS COACH KNOX SAID, THE CREAM USUALLY COMES TO THE TOP.
YOU1000000038_S0000049	AND SEIFERT, THEY HOSTED A FOUR TEAM SCRIMMAGE YESTERDAY, WHICH INCLUDED PARKSIDE, JAMESON BENNETT, AND COLONEL RICHARDSON. NOW A STRONG PLAY FOR BOTH TEAMS IN THIS THING.
YOU1000000038_S0000050	AND SPEAKING OF STRONG PLAYS, CHECK OUT THIS RUN HERE BY TJ HAYWARD. I MEAN, JUST KNOCKING GUYS OUT OF HIS WAY, BARRELING DOWNHILL. COLONEL RICHARDSON WAS MOVING THE BALL AS WELL IN THIS THING. THEIR QUARTERBACK SNEAKS HERE IN THE MIDDLE UP THE CREASE.
YOU1000000038_S0000051	MAKING A LOT OF GUYS MISS. HE'S GOING TO BE A GOTTA WATCH THIS YEAR. PARKSIDE. ON THE OTHER HAND, THEY WERE GETTING IT DONE THROUGH THE AIR. AARON, THIS ONE OUT WAY DOWNHILL. DEVIN REDDING SLINGS THAT BEAUTIFUL CATCH THERE FOR COMPLETION.
YOU1000000038_S0000055	YOU KNOW SPENCER ACTUALLY BEING OUT THERE ON SATURDAY FELT LIKE EACH TEAM WAS ACTUALLY PLAYING FOR A CHAMPIONSHIP ONE TEAM THAT STOOD OUT FROM THE REST OF THEM WERE THE RAMS AND I MEAN THEIR RUNNING GAME WAS ON POINT FINDING THE HOLES EVADING DEFENDERS. THEY COULD DO NO WRONG IN MY EYES
YOU1000000038_S0000056	ON THE OTHER HAND, ONE OF THE TEAMS THAT MADE SOME MISTAKES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BALL WERE THE BLUE JAYS. I SPOKE TO COACH DARLING. HE SAID HIS TEAM IS TOO SELFISH RIGHT NOW AND IS TRYING TO GET THEM TO BE A MORE COHESIVE UNIT. AND, YOU KNOW, THE SCRIMMAGE IS ACTUALLY GOING TO HELP THEM GET TO THAT BETTER DIRECTION.
YOU1000000038_S0000057	ABSOLUTELY, AND IT'S ALWAYS TOUGH TOO. THAT'S HIS FIRST YEAR AT THE PROGRAM. SO MOVING FORWARD, YOU KIND OF NEED TO GET THAT SENIOR LEADERSHIP AND KIND OF ESTABLISH YOURSELF. SO I'M SURE HE'LL BE FINE DOWN THE STRETCH, BUT EARLY ON, THAT'S ALWAYS TOUGH TO GO. BUT THE THING THAT REALLY IMPRESSED ME WAS PARKSIDE. I MEAN, THEY HAD SOME GUYS DOWN THE FIELD THAT WERE DEFINITELY MAKING SOME PLAYS AT THE BALL.
YOU1000000038_S0000063	HOW YOU DOING? I'M MATT GRIFFITH FROM EASTON HIGH SCHOOL HEAD VARSITY FOOTBALL COACH. YOU'RE WATCHING THE DELMARVA SPORTS INSIDER.
YOU1000000038_S0000066	WE HAVE OUR OWN TREY MILES, WHO'S A Y HIGH ALUM, HAD A CHANCE TO TALK TO HIS OLD COACH ABOUT THE PROGRAM'S DIRECTION. TREY, WERE YOU TEMPTED TO PUT ON SOME GEAR, AND DO YOU MISS IT?
YOU1000000038_S0000069	SO I STOPPED BY PRACTICE AND CHATTED WITH MY FORMER JV COACH, NOW VARSITY HEAD COACH, PAT MCGLINCHEY, TO SEE EXACTLY WHAT YI WILL NEED TO IMPROVE UPON TO RETURN TO THE BAYSIDE DOMINANCE.
YOU1000000038_S0000076	MY MAN NELSON BROWN WILL BE FEATURED IN THIS OFFENSE. TALK ABOUT HIM AND WHY HE EXCELS AT WHAT HE DOES.
YOU1000000038_S0000077	NELSON BROWN IS JUST ONE OF THOSE PHENOMENAL ATHLETES. HE'S NOT AN ATHLETE THAT COMES AROUND ALL THE TIME. NELSON'S BEING LOOKED AT BY DIVISION I AA FOOTBALL SCHOOLS.
YOU1000000038_S0000078	HE'S A SCHOLARSHIP KID AND WE'RE WAITING ON THAT FOR A SCHOLARSHIP. MORGAN STATE'S BEEN REALLY LOOKING HARD AT HIM, BUT BESIDE THAT, HE GOES OUT THERE AND HE'S THE ULTRA COMPETITOR.
YOU1000000038_S0000081	I WOULD SAY THE NEWCOMER THAT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOST IS RAEKWON MCCARTER. HE'S JUST AT EVERY SINGLE THING THAT WE COULD OFFER. HE GOES TO THE OFFSEASON TRAINING, THE WEIGHT ROOM, THE BEACH.
YOU1000000038_S0000083	YOU GOT A NEW GUY HERE AT CORNER, KEIONDRE CAUSTON, WHO WHEN WE SAW HIM AT THE BENTAY CAMP, HONESTLY IN MY EYES, HE WAS THE BEST CORNER THERE. TALK ABOUT HIM AND WHAT THIS YOUNG DEFENSE WILL BRING TO THE TABLE.
YOU1000000038_S0000084	YEAH, OUR D BACKS THIS YEAR ARE PRETTY MUCH ALL NEW. LIKE YOU SAID, KEIONDRE IS ONE OF THOSE GUYS WHO'S GONNA TRY TO SHUT YOU DOWN A LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
YOU1000000038_S0000088	THERE'S THAT MAN NELSON BROWN. HE WAS OUT ON SATURDAY WITH A SHOULDER BRUISE JUST PRECAUTIONARY. HE TOLD ME HE EXPECTS TO PRACTICE ON MONDAY. THERE'S ANOTHER STAR SHANE LEATHERBERRY AND HE IS A VETERAN AND NATURAL BORN LEADER OF THE WILDCATS. I EXPECT THOSE YOUNG GUYS THERE TO LOOK UP FOR HIM.
YOU1000000038_S0000092	GETS THE PICK RIGHT THERE, HE'S OUT ON THE ISLAND BY HIMSELF, AND THIS GUY WILL BE A NATURAL BORN LEADER. ONE THING I REALLY LIKED ABOUT WAIHAI WAS THEIR DEFENSIVE LINE. THAT RIGHT THERE IS TERREZ SAVAGE BREAKING THROUGH AND DROPPING LEATHERBERRY FOR THE SACK.
YOU1000000038_S0000093	I'M TELLING YOU, HIM AND MEL MORRIS ARE TWO STUDS ON THE DEFENSIVE LINE. THIS PLAY RIGHT HERE BY THIS YOUNG MAN, RAEKWON MCCARTER, IS JUST A FABULOUS PLAY. LOOK AT HIM TAKE IT DOWN THROUGH THE MIDDLE AND GET THOSE DEFENDERS OUT OF HIS WAY. THAT'S JUST A FILTHY MOVE. EXCUSE ME, THANK YOU FOR A TOUCHDOWN.
YOU1000000038_S0000094	THIS KID'S GONNA BE A STUD. NOT TO BE OUTDONE, DELMAR JR., DEJOR BROWN, TAKES THE HANDOFF STRAIGHT UP THE MIDDLE. 60 YARDS OUT, AND HE DIDN'T EVEN GET TOUCHED, FOLKS. HE'S GOT SOME BURNERS. HE HAD A GREAT SCRIMMAGE AS WELL.
YOU1000000038_S0000095	AND FOR DEL MAR COACH DAVE HEARN, HE KNOWS THAT THE PRESEASON IS ALL ABOUT FIGURING HIS TEAM OUT.
YOU1000000038_S0000102	MY NAME IS DAVID WELLS, INSIDE LINEBACKER FOR JAMES M. BENNETT, AND YOU'RE WATCHING DELMAURO SPORTS INSIDER.
YOU1000000038_S0000105	HEAD COACH WHEATLEY'S TEAM WILL BE TRYING TO MAKE IT TO THE STATE TOURNAMENT AFTER COMING UP WITH JUST ONE GAME SHORT A YEAR AGO, FINISHING WITH A 9 6 RECORD. THAT RIGHT THERE WAS SARAH DAVIS PUTTING ON THE MOVES FROM WAY OUTSIDE AND SCORING IT. JUST A BEAUTIFUL GOAL.
YOU1000000038_S0000106	AND THEN JUST A FEW MINUTES LATER, THE RAIDERS, THEY WERE RIGHT BACK AT IT. THEY FOUND THE NET ONE MORE TIME. THIS ONE WAS FROM BRADY KEELER WITH THE HONORS WITH A BEAUTIFUL SLAP SHOT.
YOU1000000038_S0000110	YEAH, DEFINITELY WHEN YOU RAISE IT UP THERE. AND THE FACT IS, I LOOKED AT THIS TEAM AND WE WENT IN, I WAS TALKING WITH COACH WHEALY AFTERWARDS. THEY KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SCORE THE BALL. THEY KNEW THEY HAD A GOOD OPPORTUNITY OF BEING A VERY HIGH SCORING TEAM, BUT THEY DIDN'T REALIZE HOW GOOD THEY WERE GOING TO BE DEFENSIVELY. AND THEY DEFINITELY SHOWED THAT IN THE SCRIMMAGE.
YOU1000000038_S0000114	YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. AND BY THE WAY, CONGRATULATIONS TO COACH WHEATLEY. SHE ACTUALLY JUST GOT MARRIED A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.
YOU1000000038_S0000119	WE'VE GOT 15 GIRLS OUT HERE. WE KIND OF TRIED TO GO WITH OUR MOST ATHLETIC GIRLS AND JUST KIND OF WORK WITH IT FROM THERE. BUT THEY'RE VERY EXCITED. COACH JACKSON AND I ARE VERY EXCITED. SO IT'S ALWAYS COOL TO HAVE A NEW PROGRAM, GIVE THE KIDS SOME MORE EXPERIENCES.
YOU1000000038_S0000124	AND SPENCER, ONE OF THE THINGS THEY HAVE TO ALSO SEE IS BEING ABLE TO BUILD THAT ROSTER AND SEE WHO'S ACTUALLY GOING TO BE ABLE TO PERFORM WELL ON THE COURT.
YOU1000000038_S0000129	THIS IS MONICA WHEATLEY FOR THE WOODBRIDGE FIELD HOCKEY TEAM AND YOU ARE WATCHING THE DELMARVA SPORTS INSIDER.
YOU1000000038_S0000132	MY SLEEPER PICK IS ACTUALLY SOMEONE I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL WITH, T.Y. HILTON FROM THE COLTS, A WIDE RECEIVER. AND HE WAS AS IMPRESSIVE AS ANDREW LUCK'S NUMBER ONE OPTION LAST SEASON AFTER THE INJURY TO PRO KANE REGGIE WAYNE.
YOU1000000038_S0000133	I MEAN JUST LOOK AT THOSE STATS FROM LAST SEASON. HILTON HAD 1,083 YARDS AND FIVE TOUCHDOWNS. HE'S SPEEDY AND SURE. WAYNE IS COMING BACK THIS SEASON, BUT I THINK HILTON WILL PUT UP BIG NUMBERS THIS SEASON.
YOU1000000038_S0000135	YEAH, WELL, MY SLEEPER I DID NOT GO TO HIGH SCHOOL WITH, BUT I'M GOING WITH E.J. MANUEL. MANUEL MISSED SIX GAMES LAST SEASON WITH AN HYPEREXTENDED KNEE, BUT HE'S GOT SOME SERIOUS WEAPONS NOW. C.J. SPILLER, FRED JACKSON.
YOU1000000038_S0000136	THEY TRADED UP IN THE DRAFT FOR SAMMY WATKINS. HE'S A MONSTER. THEY ADD ROBERT WOODS AND SPEEDSTER MARQUISE GOODWIN. AND THEY GOT MIKE WILLIAMS ON. AND I MEAN, THERE'S A LOT OF WEAPONS THERE. A LOT OF YOUNG WEAPONS, BUT THEY'RE VERY TALENTED. HE'S UNDRAFTED IN MOST LEAGUES, YOU KNOW.
YOU1000000038_S0000138	I THINK THERE'S A BIG REASON WHY HE'S UNDRAFTED IN MOST LEAGUES. I'M SLEEPING ON MANUEL MOVING FORWARD.
YOU1000000038_S0000139	BUT THE GUY I'M GOING WITH, I MEAN, TIGHT ENDS ARE ALWAYS HARD TO FIND. I THINK LADARIUS GREEN IS GOING TO HAVE A BIG YEAR FOR THESE CHARGERS IN THIS YEAR.
YOU1000000038_S0000140	I MEAN HE DIDN'T EXACTLY HAVE AMAZING NUMBERS LAST YEAR I GET IT JUST 13 CATCHES AND THREE TDS BUT HE'S STARTING TO TAKE MORE AND MORE REPS WITH THE ONES PHILIP RIVERS LOVES HIS TIGHT ENDS AND I THINK HE'S GONNA GET A LOT OF BALLS THROWN HIS WAY THIS YEAR
YOU1000000038_S0000147	DRUM ROLL. I GOT GRONK. I KNOW. SOMEONE OUT THERE ALSO HAS ROB GRONKOWSKI AS THEIR BUST. I KNOW. THIS GUY'S COMING OFF AN ACL INJURY, AND HE'S NO ADRIAN PREVEASON. LET'S BE REAL. THE UNLUCKY NUMBER HERE IS 14. AND NO, THAT'S NOT THE NUMBER OF TOUCHDOWNS.
YOU1000000038_S0000149	HE'S ALSO HAD EIGHT CAREER SURGERIES. I JUST DON'T SEE THE SPARK IN GRONKOWSKI. HOW MUCH CAN HE REALLY PHYSICALLY OVERCOME THIS SEASON? THE GAME IS JUST GETTING EVEN HARDER.
YOU1000000038_S0000150	I DON'T KNOW, ANYTIME YOU GOT BRADY, I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.
YOU1000000038_S0000152	ALL RIGHT, SORRY NOT SORRY EAGLES FANS, BUT I'M GOING WITH NICK FOLES. Y'ALL KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. NICK FOLES HAD AMAZING NUMBERS LAST SEASON, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHY I'M STAYING AWAY FROM HIM. TEAMS NOW HAVE FILM ON THEM, AND THEY'RE PREPARED FOR CHIP KELLY'S OFFENSE.
YOU1000000038_S0000153	PLUS HE LOST TO SEAN JACKSON. HE LOOKED LOST WHEN I WAS UP THERE AT EAGLES CAMP, GUYS. BUT SO DID ALL THE OTHER EAGLES QUARTERBACKS. BUT I'M NOT SAYING DON'T DRAFT THE EAGLES, ESPECIALLY SEAN MCCOY.
YOU1000000038_S0000154	BUT I DON'T THINK FOLES IS GOING TO PUT UP HALF THE NUMBERS HE PUT UP LAST YEAR.
YOU1000000038_S0000157	I DEFINITELY GOING TO STAY AWAY FROM THOUGH IS ERIC DECKER. I MEAN, THIS GUY IS DEFINITELY GOING TO COST SOME PEOPLE FROM WINNING THEIR LEAGUES. I GET IT. I MEAN, HE HAD SOME GOOD NUMBERS IN DENVER, BUT THE FACT IS THAT OFFENSE IS RIDICULOUS THERE.
YOU1000000038_S0000160	NEXT WEEK WHEN WE BRING IN CHRIS RUSSELL FROM ESPN 980 IN DC TO TALK ABOUT THE REDSKINS AND COMING UP AFTER THE BREAK ONE OF OUR FAVORITE SEGMENTS CRAZY CATCHES DIVES AND STOPS OUR PLAYS OF THE WEEK COMING UP YOU WON'T WANT TO MISS IT
YOU1000000038_S0000161	MY NAME IS TRISTAN HARRIS, QUARTERBACK AT DOVER HIGH, AND YOU'RE WATCHING DELMARVA SPORTS INSIDER.
YOU1000000038_S0000170	AND WE TAKE IT OVER TO SOME CLIPPERS AND COLONEL ACTION. IT'S ONLY A SCRIMMAGE, BUT WHY DOES THEY LOOK LIKE MIDSEASON FORM? SENIOR QUARTERBACK JACOB LARMORE, UNDER PRESSURE, STILL ABLE TO FIND THAT RECEIVER.
YOU1000000038_S0000171	STEVENSONI, I MEAN, WITH A DEFENDER ON HIM MAKES THE INCREDIBLE CATCH. HE WAS IN THE AIR.
YOU1000000038_S0000173	GORGEOUS. AND MY PLAY OF THE DAY WILL COME FROM THE SCRIMMAGE I WAS AT. WHY HIGH SOPHOMORE RUNNING BACK RAEKWON MCCARTER GETS A SWEEP OFF THE RIGHT SIDE.
YOU1000000038_S0000179	AND SO MANY PLAYS. AND DON'T FORGET TO LOOK FOR US OUT ON THE FIELD THIS WEEK. ON WEDNESDAY, WE WILL BE AT INDIAN RIVER FOR THEIR FOOTBALL SCRIMMAGE AGAINST HUTCHINSON. AND THEN ON THURSDAY, WE'LL BE AT PARKSIDE'S VOLLEYBALL MATCH AGAINST COLONEL RICHARDSON.

YOU1000000044_S0001058	I THINK ALL OF THEM GOT THE MEDAL OF HONOR AND I THINK THEY WERE THE FIRST TO RECEIVE IT EXCEPT ANDREWS. HE WAS EXCLUDED AS A CIVILIAN, UNFORTUNATELY.
