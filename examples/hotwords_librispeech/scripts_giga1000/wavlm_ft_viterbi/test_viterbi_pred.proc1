POD1000000005_S0000052	BUT IN THE END MAYBE IT'S OKA THAT KIM DIDN'T HITCH HIS WAGON TO THE CLOTHING GIANT
POD1000000005_S0000053	FOREVER TWENTY ONE'S RISE TO FAST FASHION DOMINANCE WAS DIZZYING
POD1000000005_S0000054	BUT THE BRAND'S UNBRIDLED EXPANSION MOM AND POP MANAGEMENT APPROACH AND WEAK ECOMMERCE GAMES SET IT UP TO FALL HARD
POD1000000005_S0000055	DESPITE THOSE FOUR NINETY NINE LEGGANGS

POD1000000005_S0000069	COE THIS
POD1000000005_S0000071	THIS NEIGHBORHOOD IS BY KOREANS FOR KOREANS
POD1000000005_S0000072	THOUGH A HEAFTY NUMBER OF NON KOREANS COME FOR THE AFOREMENTIONED SPAS AND THE KEPOP SHOPS AND THE MOUTH NUMBING KIMCHI
POD1000000005_S0000073	SO IT'S REALLY FOR US IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE POLITICAL SOCIAL HEADQUARTER OR CENTER FOR OUR COMMUNITY
POD1000000005_S0000074	AND ALSO CRETTOWN L A IN ESSENCE IS THE HEADQUARTER FOR KOREAN AMERICA USA
POD1000000005_S0000075	LOS ANGELES HAS THE LARGEST KOREAN COMMUNITY OF ANY CITY IN THE U S
POD1000000005_S0000076	BUT BECAUSE OF LANGUAGE AND CULTURAL BARRIERS IM SAYS HER COMMUNITY HAS OFTEN FELT ISOLATED
POD1000000005_S0000077	THIS NEIGHBORHOOD THOUGH IS A HOME BASE
POD1000000005_S0000078	IN ESSENCE LIKE AS A CORIAN AMERICAN KNOWING THERE'S KORIATOWN AND ALL THE PEOPLE THAT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO MEET BECAUSE THIS SPACE ALLOWS OUR COMMUNITIES TO COME TOGETHER AND TO BE VISIBLE I DON'T FEEL ALONE
POD1000000005_S0000079	I WANTED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW THIS PLACE WITH ITS TIHTENIT KOREAN CHURCHES AND ITS EVER YOUTHFUL K BEAUTY BOUTIQUS BIRTHED ONE OF THE LARGEST FAST FASHION BRANDS IN THE WORLD
POD1000000005_S0000081	AFTER THE U S AND KOREA ESTABLISHED OFFICIAL DIPLOMATIC TIES IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO THE FIRST WAVE OF KOREAN IMMIGRATION BEGAN TO ROLL IN
POD1000000005_S0000082	FIRST TO HAWAII THEN TO LOS ANGELES
POD1000000005_S0000083	IT WAS FOLLOWED BY A SECOND SURGE AFTER THE KOREAN WAR
POD1000000005_S0000084	THE WATTS RIOTS OF NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE PUSHED A LOT OF KOREANS TO THE LA SUBURBS
POD1000000005_S0000085	BUT THE NUMBER OF NEW ARRIVALS TO THE CITY FROM SOUTH KOREA CONTINUED TO GROW THANKS TO A LOOSENING OF IMMIGRATION LAWS
POD1000000005_S0000086	BY THE TIME IMM ARRIVED IN THE U S IN NINETEN SEVENTY FOUR THE COMMUNITY WAS ALREADY ON THE WAY UP
POD1000000005_S0000087	THANKS TO SOME HUSTLING BY A FEW LOCAL KOREAN BUSINESSMEN KOREA TOWN GOT ITS OWN OFFICIAL BLUE NEIGHBORHOOD SIGNS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY
POD1000000005_S0000088	SO THERE WAS KIND OF THAT SIGNAGE
POD1000000005_S0000089	ALTHOUGH ALREADY THERE WAS THE CHURCH AND THE GROCERY STORE YOU KNOW STARTED TO ANGER THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY RIGHT AND THE RESTAURANT SO
POD1000000005_S0000090	JUST AFTER KOREA TOWN BECAME LEGIT A COUPLE NAMED DOWAN AND JINSUK CHANG EMIGRATED FROM SOL
POD1000000005_S0000091	THEY CAME IN SEARCH OF THE SAME THING OUR PAL DE J KIM WAS AFTER THE AMERICAN DREAM
POD1000000005_S0000092	IN SOUTH KOREA MR CHANG RAN A COFFEE AND JUICE DELIVERY BUSINESS
POD1000000005_S0000093	MRS CHANG WAS A HAIRDRESSER WHEN THEY MOVED TO LA THEY TOOK A SERIES OF MENIAL JOBS TO MAKE ENDS MEET
POD1000000005_S0000094	MR CHENG HAS TALKED ABOUT HOW HE WORKED AS A GAS STATION ATTENDANT
POD1000000005_S0000095	HE DID JANITORIAL WORK
POD1000000005_S0000096	THAT'S SUPNA MAHASHARI SHE'S A BUSINESS REPORTER AT THE NEW YORK TIMES
POD1000000005_S0000097	THE LEGEND HAS IT THAT HE WAS WORKING AT A GAS STATION AND AS HE SAW PEOPLE WITH THESE REALLY NICE CARS HE WOULD ALWAYS ASK THEM WHAT THEY DID
POD1000000005_S0000098	ND HE NOTICED THE PEOPLE WITH THE NICEST CARS WORKED IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY
POD1000000005_S0000099	OK NOW I WOULD THINK THAT THE PEOPLE WITH THE NICEST CARS IN L A WERE LIKE JACK NICHOLSON AND MAL GIBSON BUT WHAT DO I KNOW
POD1000000005_S0000100	FOR SOME REASON THE GARMENT TRADE JUST BECAME FIXED IN MR CHANG'S MIND SO HE AND HIS WIFE WENT FOR IT
POD1000000005_S0000101	THE TWO OF THEM PUT TOGETHER THEIR SAVINGS AND THEY DECIDED TO OPEN A STORE THAT WAS FIRST CALLED FASHION TWENTY ONE
POD1000000005_S0000102	AND THEY FIGURED OUT WITH THE GARMENT MANUFACTURING IN LOS ANGELES HOW TO DELIVER FASHIONS THAT PEOPLE WANTED AND TO COME UP WITH A WAY OF SELLING CLOTHES THAT CHURNED THROUGH STYLES MADE AN EXCITING ENVIRONMENT
POD1000000005_S0000103	AND REALLY CREATED THE TYPE OF PLACE WHERE YOU HAD TO COME IN TO SEE WHAT WAS NEW
POD1000000005_S0000104	NOW THIS MIGHT NOT SEEM VERY REVOLUTIONARY
POD1000000005_S0000105	ESPECIALLY TODAY WHEN CONSUMERS CAN GET KNOCKOFFS OF THE LATEST LUXURY FASHIONS SEEMINGLY BEFORE THE MODELS HAVE STRUDDED OFF THE CATWALK
POD1000000005_S0000106	BUT IN THE EIGHTY S THAT WASN'T REALLY HOW FASHION WAS DONE
POD1000000005_S0000107	THEY HIT ON SOMETHING AS HAPPENS IN RETAIL THEY HIT UPON A FORMULA THAT RESONATED WITH SHOPPERS AND THEY QUICKLY BECAME A SUCCESS
POD1000000005_S0000108	IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR THE CHANGS OPENED FASHION TWENTY ONE A NINE HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT BOUTIQUE IN THE HEART OF THE HIGHLAND PARK NEIGHBORHOOD
POD1000000005_S0000109	THEY PACKED IT WITH CHEAP SKIMPY TEEN CLOTHES THAT THEY BOUGHT FROM LA'S KOREAN AMERICAN GARMENT MANUFACTURERS LIKE THE KIND MR KIM SOLD
POD1000000005_S0000110	I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DEFINITELY HELPED THEM WAS THE FACT THAT THEY WERE IN LOS ANGELES AND TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE OTHER KOREAN AMERICAN GARMENT MANUFACTURERS IN THAT CITY SPECIFICALLY
POD1000000005_S0000111	SO I THINK THAT VERY MUCH WAS A PROPELLER OF THEIR SUCCESS
POD1000000005_S0000112	REMEMBER THE JOBBER MARKET
POD1000000005_S0000113	JABA J O PB JAVA MARK
POD1000000005_S0000114	KIM EXPLAINS THAT THE JOBBER MARKET CAME ABOUT AROUND THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO WITH THE ARRIVAL OF KOREAN IMMIGRANTS FROM SOUTH AMERICA
POD1000000005_S0000115	HE CAME FROM BOLIVIA MANY OF THE OTHER FOLKS HAD WORKED IN BRAZIL IN THAT COUNTRY'S MASSIVE GARMENT INDUSTRY AND THEY ALL BOUGHT THAT EXPERIENCE WITH THEM TO LA
POD1000000005_S0000116	THEY BOUGHT WHOLESALE CLOTHES OUT GARMENTS AND WENT TO WORK OPENING THEIR OWN STORES
POD1000000005_S0000117	PEOPLE STARTED TO SELL DEAT MERCHANDISE
POD1000000005_S0000118	BUT THE PEOPLE COME FROM THE BRAZILE THEYR STARTING THE MAKING MANUFACTURING THEIR OWN BRAND OFPERART
POD1000000005_S0000119	BY THE TIME THE CHANGS GOT TO LA THE KOREAN AMERICAN APPAREL INDUSTRY WAS ALREADY IN FULL SWING
POD1000000005_S0000120	THE COUPLE WORKED WITH MANUFACTURERS IN THE JOBER MARKET TO FILL UP FASHION TWENTY ONE WITH INEXPENSIVE STYLES THAT COULD BE TURNED OVER QUICKLY
POD1000000005_S0000122	MY PRODUCER WHITNEY AND I DECIDED TO SEE WHERE IT ALL BEGAN
POD1000000005_S0000123	SO WE TOOK A TRIP TO FIFTY SIX THIRTY SEVEN NORTH FIGROA STREET AND CRUISED AROUND THE SHOP FOR A BIT
POD1000000005_S0000125	THE SIGN ON THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING STILL READS FASHION TWENTY ONE AN OMAGE TO ITS HUMBLE ROOTS
POD1000000005_S0000126	BUT IT'S A FOREVER TWENTY ONE STORE THROUGH AND THROUGH
POD1000000005_S0000127	C STYLES FROM ONE DOLLAR BODY SU
POD1000000005_S0000129	BODY SUITIN THERE FOR EIGHT BUCKS IF YOU WANT
POD1000000005_S0000130	I'VE GOT ALL THE BODYSUITS I NEED RIGHT NOW
POD1000000005_S0000131	WELL THAT'S DEBATABLE
POD1000000005_S0000132	WE POP INSIDE AND IT LOOKS PRETTY CLASSY
POD1000000005_S0000133	LIKE MAYBE IT'S MORE FOR ADULTS THAN TEENS
POD1000000005_S0000134	WE HEAD TO A RACK OF GRAPHIC TS AND I'M KIND OF INTO TEM
POD1000000005_S0000135	I MEAN I WOULD ONE HUNDRED PERCENT WEAR THAT
POD1000000005_S0000137	ADSHOOT
POD1000000005_S0000138	IF THEY HAVE T LIKE A LARGE I WOULD TOTALLY WEAR THAT
POD1000000005_S0000139	CAN'T STOP ONE STOP
POD1000000005_S0000140	WELLTHT'S RIGHTTHAT'S RIGHT YOU CAN'T STOP ONE STEP
POD1000000005_S0000141	ALAS WE LEFT EMPTY HANDED NO EIGHT DOLLAR BODY SUITS FOR WHITNEY
POD1000000005_S0000143	IF THE FASHION TWENTY ONE STORE ON FIGAROA WAS REPRESENTATIVE OF WHAT THE CHANG'S BUSINESS WAS IN THE EARLY DAYS IT SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A NICE LITTLE LIFE FOR THEM
POD1000000005_S0000144	IN ITS FIRST YEAR THE STORE PULLED IN SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
POD1000000005_S0000145	AND THAT WAS LARGELY THANKS TO OTHER KOREAN IMMIGRANTS
POD1000000005_S0000146	BUT THEN THEY REALIZED HOW SUCCESSFUL THIS BUSINESS MODEL WAS
POD1000000005_S0000147	AND THEY STARTED OPENING NEW STORES
POD1000000005_S0000148	THAT'S LUDOVIKA CIARIO SHE'S A MARKETING PROFESSOR AT LIHIG UNIVERSITY
POD1000000005_S0000149	THEY THEN CHANGE THE NAME TO FOREVER TWENTY ONE WITH THE IDEA THAT THEY'RE SELLING CLOTHES FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO BE TRENDY OR FRESH OR JUST YOUNG MORE GENERALLY
POD1000000005_S0000150	THIS BUSINESS MODEL SELLING CHEAP TRENDY CLOTHES THAT COULD BE MANUFACTURED QUICKLY AND TURNED OVER FREQUENTLY SO THE STORES ALWAYS FELT NEW AND FRESH THAT WAS THE CHANG'S SECRET WEAPON
POD1000000005_S0000151	TODAY WE CALL THIS APPROACH FAST FASHION AND LOTS OF GLOBAL BRANDS DO IT H AND M ZARA AND ASOS TO NAME A FEW
POD1000000005_S0000152	BUT FOREVER TWENTY ONE PERFECTED IT
POD1000000005_S0000153	FOR A DEFINITION OF FAST FASHION HERE'S THE WASHINGTON POST FASHION CRITIC I'M SORRY THE PULLITZER PRIZE WINNING FASHION CRITIC ROBIN GAVAN
POD1000000005_S0000154	I MEAN IT'S GENERALLY CLOTHING THAT IS PRODUCED VERY QUICKLY VERY MUCH LEAPING ONTO A TREND OF THE MOMENT AND NOT MEANT TO LAST
POD1000000005_S0000155	MEANING THE DESIGN IS NOT MENTALLATE OR THE CLOTHING IS NOT MENTALLASE
POD1000000005_S0000156	BOTH THE IDEA IS THAT IF YOU WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN A TREND IN A FAD AND ONE THAT IS MOST LIKELY A FLEETING FAD FAST FASHION ALLOWS YOU TO GLAM ON TO THAT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
POD1000000005_S0000157	IT ALLOWS YOU TO GRASP IT FOR MINIMAL COST
POD1000000005_S0000158	WEAR IT A FEW TIMES
POD1000000005_S0000159	SAVOR THE MOMENT LITERALLY THE MOMENT AND THEN MOVE ON
POD1000000005_S0000160	AND FAST FASHION TRADES IN POMO SAYS CISARIO
POD1000000005_S0000161	THERE'S THIS ALMOST FEAR OF MISSING OUT THAT IF YOU DON'T GO TO THE STORE AS SOON AS THE SHIPMENT ARRIVES YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO FIND THAT PRODUCT IN YOUR SIZE
POD1000000005_S0000162	AND SO IT CREATES THIS SENSE OF URGENCY BASICALLY IN CONSUMERS TO WANT TO MAKE THEM KEEP COMING BACK TO THE STORE
POD1000000005_S0000163	THAT AND INSANELY CHEAP PRICES
POD1000000005_S0000164	LIKE CLOTHES FOR UNDER TEN DOLLARS APIECE
POD1000000005_S0000165	THIS BUSINESS MODEL PLUS A MANAGEABLE NUMBER OF STORES MEANT THAT THE CHANG'S OPERATION WAS PROFITABLE AND EVERYTHING WAS PRETTY DECENT
POD1000000005_S0000166	BUT THE CHANGS WEREN'T INTERESTED IN PRETTY DECENT
POD1000000005_S0000167	THEY WERE CHASING THEIR BIG BOLD AMERICAN DREAM
POD1000000005_S0000168	I THINK THAT MR CHENG AT LEAST IN THIS PERIOD WHERE HE STARTED EXPANDING INTO DEPARTMENT STORES
POD1000000005_S0000169	ALSO THOUGHT THAT FOREVER TWENTY ONE COULD BE MORE THAN WHERE COLLEGE GIRLS GOT A NEW OUTFIT FOR SATURDAY NIGHT
POD1000000005_S0000170	HE THOUGHT THAT MAYBE THEY COULD BE A PLACE WHERE THE WHOLE FAMILY COULD BE OUTFITTED
POD1000000005_S0000171	WHERE YOU WOULD REALLY TRUST THIS STORE TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A LOT OF THE CLOTHING FOR YOUR EVERYDAY LIFE
POD1000000005_S0000173	TWELVE MILES FROM THE FIRST FOREVER TWENTY ONE PROPERTY IS THE BEVERLY CENTER A SPRAWLING SHOPPING MALL THAT ONE ANGELINO TOLD ME IS QUOTE ONE OF THE MOST HATED MALLS IN L A
POD1000000005_S0000174	IT'S MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND SQUARE FEET OF PRADA FENDI AND BOLINSIAGA
POD1000000005_S0000175	TUCKED INTO A CORNER ON LEVEL EIGHT IS X X I FOREVER WHICH I GUESS IS FOR EVER TWENTY ONE BUT MAKE IT LUXURY
POD1000000005_S0000176	THE STORE OCCUPIES MORE THAN AN ACRE OF REAL ESTATE AND IS NOT MEANT FOR PEOPLE OVER A CERTAIN AGE
POD1000000005_S0000177	IT'S BRIGHT AND LOUD AND THE SEEMINGLY NEVER ENDING SELECTION OF CLOTHES IS DISORIENT
POD1000000005_S0000178	HONESTLY I FELT LIKE I NEEDED A ZANEX AND A NAP AFTER WE VISITED
POD1000000005_S0000179	BUT THIS WAS WHAT THE CHANGS WERE AFTER THEY WERE PLANTING THEIR FLAG WITH HUGE SOARES IN FANCY MALLS
POD1000000005_S0000180	THIS WAS THEIR AMERICAN DREAM REALIZED
POD1000000005_S0000181	AND THEY BUILT IT LARGELY ON TOP OF THE ASHES OF FALLEN RETAILERS
POD1000000005_S0000182	IT WAS REALLY IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS THAT YOU SAW THEM SORT OF BURST ONTO THE NATIONAL SCENE AND THAT REALLY EMERGED WITH THE ACQUISITION OF STORES OWNED BY GADZUK
POD1000000005_S0000183	DO YOU REMEMBER THAT RETAILER
POD1000000005_S0000184	GADZUX WAS A TEEN CLOTHING COMPANY WITH HUNDREDS OF STORES AND MALLS ACROSS THE U S
POD1000000005_S0000185	IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR IT FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY
POD1000000005_S0000186	AND SO THERE 'S ALL THESE STORES AND OTHER ASSETS THAT WERE UP FOR PURCHASE AND FOREVER TWENTY ONE BIT ON THOSE SUCCESSFULLY
POD1000000005_S0000187	AND WITH THAT THEY REALLY EXPANDED THEIR STORE BASE AND ALSO BECAME A NATIONAL PLAYER IN A WHOLE NEW WAY
POD1000000005_S0000188	IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE FOREVER TWENTY ONE BEGAN A PERIOD OF MIND BLOWING EXPANSION
POD1000000005_S0000189	WHEN MALL CHAINS LIKE MURVINS AND SEERS AND OTHERS WERE TOPPLING UNDER THEIR OWN WEIGHT FOREVER TWENTY ONE WAS SNATCHING UP THEIR SCRAPS
POD1000000005_S0000190	WHEN THE GLOBAL RECESSION HIT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE CHANGS LOOKED AT IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PUSH EVEN HARDER
POD1000000005_S0000191	NOTHING LIKE HITTING THE GAS WHEN YOUR COMPETITORS ARE SLAMMING INTO THE GUARD RAILS
POD1000000005_S0000192	BY TWENTY ELEVEN FOREVER TWENTY ONE HAD ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED STORES AROUND THE COUNTRY AND EMPLOYED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE
POD1000000005_S0000193	WITHIN JUST A FEW YEARS AFTER THAT THE COMPANY HAD EXPANDED TO FORTY SEVEN COUNTRIES
POD1000000005_S0000194	SO THAT MEANT THAT TWEENS IN THE PHILIPPINES OR ROMANIA OR MACOW COULD ALL ROCK A BOXY SHIRT FLOUNCE CUFF TOP OR LEPARD DRAWSTRING LOUNGE SHORTS FOR LESS THAN THE PRICE OF A MOVIE TICKET
POD1000000005_S0000195	TWENTY FIFTEEN WAS FOREVER TWENTY ONE'S PEAK
POD1000000005_S0000196	IT DID FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN SALES THAT YEAR
POD1000000005_S0000197	WHICH MEANS THAT THEY SOLD A HELL OF A LOT OF TEN DOLLARS MINI DRESSES AND BRALETTES AND WHATEVER DOLPHIN SHORTS ARE
POD1000000005_S0000198	BUT EVEN THOUGH FOREVER TWENTY ONE HAD GROWN INTO A MULTI BILLION DOLLARS BUSINESS THE CHANGS RAN IT LIKE A MOM AND POP OPERATION
POD1000000005_S0000199	THEY OWNED NINETY NINE PERCENT OF THE COMPANY AND HAD NEVER TAKEN ON INVESTORS WHICH MEANT THAT THERE WAS AND I CAN'T STRESS THIS ENOUGH NO REAL BOARD OF DIRECTORS THEY HAD TO RUN DECISIONS BY
POD1000000005_S0000200	OR AT LEAST NOT IN THE TRADITIONAL SENSE
POD1000000005_S0000201	THE BOARD CONSISTED OF MR CHANG ONE OF HIS DAUGHTERS AND ANOTHER FOR EVERY TWENTY ONE EXECUTIVE
POD1000000005_S0000202	THEY FELT THAT THEY WERE BUILDING SOMETHING OF AN EMPIRE THEY WERE IN CHARGE MR AND MRS CHANG WERE IN CHARGE AND THEY WERE GOING TO PASS THIS BUSINESS ON TO THEIR DAUGHTERS
POD1000000005_S0000203	AND IT WAS ONLY GOING TO GROW AND BECOME BIGGER
POD1000000005_S0000204	THE FACT THAT THEY OWNED EVERYTHING ALSO MEANT THAT THERE'S NOT MUCH PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY
POD1000000005_S0000205	AND THE FAMILY'S NOT REAL INTO TALKING TO THE PRESS
POD1000000005_S0000206	THE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT WOULDN'T TALK TO US FOR THIS STORY THOUGH WE DID REACH OUT
POD1000000005_S0000207	WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT MR CHANG OVERSAW BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND STRATEGY WHILE MRS CHANG RAN THE MERCHANDISING SIDE OF THINGS ONE FLOOR BELOW THEIR ADULT DAUGHTERS LINDA AND ESTER SERVED AS THEIR DEPUTIES
POD1000000005_S0000208	THEY KIND OF OVERSAW THEIR OWN FIEF DUMS WITHIN THE FOREVER TWENTY ONE BUSINESS
POD1000000005_S0000209	MR CHANG HAD TO REVIEW EVERY SINGLE REAL ESTATE CONTRACT AND WAS INVOLVED WITH THE OPENING OF EVERY NEW STORE WHICH AT THE PACE THAT THEY WERE EXPANDING IS IS A HUGE RESPONSIBILITY
POD1000000005_S0000210	MRS CHANG HAD HER OWN HANDS FULL
POD1000000005_S0000211	OVERSEEING THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF STYLES AND GARMENTS AND APPROVING EACH OF THOSE INDIVIDUALLY BEFORE THEY APPEARED IN STORES
POD1000000005_S0000212	I MEAN IN MANY WAYS IT'S FLABBERGASTING THAT THESE TWO PEOPLE COULD HAVE TAKEN ON THIS AMOUNT OF RESPONSIBILITY ESPECIALLY AT A COMPANY OF THIS SIZE
POD1000000005_S0000213	ONE MINUTE THEY'D BE OVERSEEING NEW REAL ESTATE PURCHASES OR CLOTHING DESIGNS AND THE NEXT MINUTE THEY'D BE APPROVING EXPENSES FOR BUSINESS LUNCHES OR UBERS

POD1000000005_S0000215	NO BILLIONAIRE CEOS ARE APPROVING TIME SHEETS OR EVEN WHAT BUTTONS OR ZIPPERS SHOULD BE USED ON NEW DESIGNS
POD1000000005_S0000216	KEVIN FAGANS WAS FOREVER TWENTY ONE'S GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR DURING THE TIME OF THE BRAND'S RAPID INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION
POD1000000005_S0000217	HE SAYS WHILE HAVING YOUR HAND IN EVERY POT MIGHT NOT BE THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO RUN A BUSINESS IT DID MEAN THAT THE CHANGS KNEW WHAT THEIR BRAND WAS ALL ABOUT
POD1000000005_S0000218	WELL I THINK THE ONE THING THEY UNDERSTOOD WAS YOU KNOW BRAND PERSONALITY
POD1000000005_S0000219	THEY KNEW THEIR CUSTOMER INCREDIBLY WELL SO

POD1000000005_S0000226	I THINK THE CHALLENGE WITH RUNNING AND OPERATING A GLOBAL BUSINESS IS THAT YOU KNOW SEASONALITY'S CHANGED
POD1000000005_S0000227	CULTURAL MINDSETS CHANGE
POD1000000005_S0000228	SO YOU KNOW WHAT THE FRENCH CUSTOMER WANTS THE GERMAN CUSTOMER DOESN'T

POD1000000005_S0000278	EDEN GOLDBLUM IS A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD HIGH SCHOOL JUNIOR WHO LIVES JUST OUTSIDE OF WASHINGTON D C
POD1000000005_S0000279	SHE USED TO SHOP IT FOR EVER TWENTY ONE A LOT SHE SAID UNTIL THEY QUOTE STOPPED BEING
POD1000000005_S0000280	THEY'RE CHEAP THEY'RE NOT IN GOOD SHAPE THEY BREAK FAST AND SOME OF THEM ARE REALLY TACKY

POD1000000005_S0000285	IT'S REAL DISAPPOINTMENT
POD1000000005_S0000286	BEFORE I GO INTO THE THIRD FOREVER TWENTY ONE OF THIS STORY I ISSUED A CHALLENGE
POD1000000005_S0000287	EACH OF US HAD TO FIND ONE CUTE THING TO BUY
POD1000000005_S0000288	BUT AFTER MANY MINUTES OF BROWSING THE ENORMOUS STORE
POD1000000005_S0000289	I DON'T THINK I CAN DO THE CHALLENGE
POD1000000005_S0000290	I DON'T THINK I CAN DO THE CHALLENGE EITHER
POD1000000005_S0000291	CAUSE IT'S OVERWHELMING ACTUAL
POD1000000005_S0000292	THING TERCUTER O
POD1000000005_S0000293	NOW IT MAKES SENSE THAT I COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING CUTE FOR ME
POD1000000005_S0000294	I MEAN THE STORE ISN'T CALLED FOREVER FORTY ONE
POD1000000005_S0000295	BUT IT SHOULD TROUBLE THE COMPANY THAT A MEMBER OF ITS TARGET DEMOGRAPHIC CAN'T FIND ANYTHING SHE LIKES IN A STORE THE SIZE OF A MCMANSION
POD1000000005_S0000296	OKY SO BASIC
POD1000000005_S0000298	LIKE A NORMIT'S LIKE A NORMAL MATERIAL
POD1000000005_S0000299	
POD1000000005_S0000300	FINALLY AFTER SOME SERIOUS HUNTING EDEN LANDED ON THE ONE THING IN THE ENTIRE STORE SHE WOULD WEAR
POD1000000005_S0000301	ALL RIGHT
POD1000000005_S0000302	CAN HOLD ON TO THAT
POD1000000005_S0000303	ALL RIGHT
POD1000000005_S0000304	THEN IT WAS UP TO ME TO FIND SOMETHING I LIKED
POD1000000005_S0000305	I TRIED ON A CROP WIND BREAKER AND THAT WENT ABOUT AS WELL AS COULD BE EXPECTED
POD1000000005_S0000306	IT'S VERY SNUG AROUND HERE LIKE IS IT SUPPOSED TO FIT LIKE THIS
POD1000000005_S0000308	GUYS I'RME JUST GONNA GO OUT FOR A JOG AND THEN I'M GONNA GO TO THE A AND THEN I'M GONNA GO TO THE CLUB AFTERWORS
POD1000000005_S0000309	FINALLY I LANDED ON MY ITEM A PLAIN BLACK BASEBALL CAP WITH THE WORDS DANGEROUS BUT FUN WRITTEN ON THE CROWN
POD1000000005_S0000310	DANGEROUS BUT
POD1000000005_S0000311	DANGEROUS BUT FUN
POD1000000005_S0000312	THINK YOU SHOULD GET THAT
POD1000000005_S0000313	YO THINK I SHOULD
POD1000000005_S0000314	I THINK YOU SHOULD
POD1000000005_S0000315	YOU THINK
POD1000000005_S0000316	NOW I CAN TELL YOU THAT I LOOKED NEITHER DANGEROUS NOR FUN
POD1000000005_S0000317	BUT I BOUGHT THE HAT AND EDEN BOUGHT THE LITTLE SKIRT AND WE BOTH FULFILLED OUR FOREVER TWENTY ONE CHALLENGE
POD1000000005_S0000318	GREAT JOB US
POD1000000005_S0000319	ARE WE DUNZA
POD1000000005_S0000320	ARE WE DUNZA
POD1000000005_S0000321	DO YO FEEL LIKE WE'RE DUNE ZA
POD1000000005_S0000322	I FEEL LIKE WE'RE DONE ZO
POD1000000005_S0000323	WE WERE DONE ZHOUGH
POD1000000005_S0000324	I LEFT FOREVER TWENTY ONE FIFTEEN DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS LIGHTER AND PERHAPS MORE CONFUSED THAN I HAD BEEN BEFORE ABOUT HOW THE BRAND'S BUSINESS MODEL COULD POSSIBLY MAKE SENSE
POD1000000005_S0000325	THERE WERE HARDLY ANY SHOPPERS IN ANY OF THE STORES I WENT TO AND THOSE WHO WERE THERE SEEMED MORE LIKE OLD MILLENNIALS THAN GENSY TASTEMAKERS
POD1000000005_S0000326	I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT THIS GIANT STORE WAS ALL ABOUT
POD1000000005_S0000327	OR HOW FAST FASHION IS EVEN SUPPOSED TO WORK
POD1000000005_S0000328	I FIGURED ROBIN GOVAN COULD HELP
POD1000000005_S0000329	IN ADDITION TO REPORTING ON THE RUNWAYS OF PARIS AND NEW YORK GIVAN OFTEN WRITES ABOUT WHAT FASHION SAYS ABOUT HOW WE LIVE NOW
POD1000000005_S0000330	AND SHE THINKS A LOT ABOUT FAST FASHION AND ITS IMPACT ON OUR CULTURE ESTHETICALLY SOCIALLY AND ENVIRONMENTALLY
POD1000000005_S0000331	SURPRISINGLY SHE ISN'T TOTALLY DOWN ON FAST FASHION
POD1000000005_S0000332	I DO THINK THAT FAST FASHION HAS KIND OF ALLOWED EVERYONE TO HAVE ACCESS TO ESTHETICALLY THOUGHTFUL CLOTHING
POD1000000005_S0000333	DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE ALL DRESSING BETTER THOUGH
POD1000000005_S0000334	NOTICE I SAID TO HAVE ACCESS TO
POD1000000005_S0000336	IN A WAY GAVAN SAYS FAST FASHION IS KIND OF BRILLIANT WHEN IT'S DONE RIGHT
POD1000000005_S0000337	FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE THEY'RE NOT GOING INTO THE DESIGNER BUTIQUE
POD1000000005_S0000338	THEY'RE GOING INTO A DEPARTMENT STORE OR A MASS MERCHANT
POD1000000005_S0000339	AND YOU KNOW THOSE STORES LOOK AT TREND REPORTS AND THEY LOOK AT WHAT'S ON THE RUNWAY AND PART OF THEIR GREAT SKILL IN BOTH MARKETING AND MANUFACTURING IS BEING ABLE TO TAKE THOSE IDEAS AND TURN THEM AROUND AT JUST A RAPID FIRE PACE AND GET THEM INTO STORES
POD1000000005_S0000340	AND THERE ISN'T JUST ONE DELIVERY THAT HAPPENS AT THE BEGINNING OF A SEASON NO NO
POD1000000005_S0000341	IT'S A CONSTANT STREAM OF NEWNESS
POD1000000005_S0000342	AND WHEN I SAY CONSTANT I MEAN LIKE EVERY TWO WEEKS FOR SOME OF THESE PLACES
POD1000000005_S0000343	SO GOVAN SAYS THAT AT ITS BEST FAST FASHION MEANS THAT NEW STYLISH CLOTHES AREN'T JUST FOR FANCIES WITH A CASH TO SHOP OCATUR
POD1000000005_S0000344	BUT I'M GOING TO LET YOU IN ON A LITTLE SECRET
POD1000000005_S0000345	IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR CLOTHING DESIGNERS TO GO FROM ORIGINAL IDEA TO BRANDSPANKING NEW PRODUCT ON THE RACK IN TWO WEEKS
POD1000000005_S0000346	ESPECIALLY NOT AT THE VOLUME THAT FOREVER TWENTY ONE NEEDED TO FILL ALL OF THEIR BRAZILIAN STORES
POD1000000005_S0000347	SO THE COMPANY HAD TO FIND SOME SHORT CUTS
POD1000000005_S0000348	COPYING OTHER DESIGNERS IDEAS WAS PART OF FOREVER TWENTY ONE'S BUSINESS MODEL FROM THE BEGINNING
POD1000000005_S0000349	SUSAN SCAFITI IS THE FOUNDER OF THE FASHION LAW INSTITUTE AT FORDAM UNIVERSITY AND SHE BASICALLY INVENTED THE FIELD OF FASHION LAW
POD1000000005_S0000350	AND SHE'LL BE THE FIRST ONE TO TELL YOU THAT WHILE FOREVER TWENTY ONE'S PRACTICE OF COPYING OTHER DESIGNERS IDEAS IS N ACUTE LOOK IT'S GENERALLY TOTALLY LEGAL
POD1000000005_S0000351	FASHION IS NOT RECOGNIZED AS AN ART FORM IN THE UNITED STATES
POD1000000005_S0000352	SO IT DOESN'T GET COPYRIGHT PROTECTION IN LARGE PART BECAUSE A HUNDRED YEARS AGO THE COPYRIGHT OFFICE DECIDED THAT FASHION NO MATTER HOW FANCIFUL WAS UTILITARIAN
POD1000000005_S0000353	ONLY A COUPLE AREAS OF FASHION ARE PROTECTED FROM COPYING
POD1000000005_S0000354	WE HAVE A TINY BIT OF COPYRIGHT PROTECTION AT LEAST SINCE THE NINETEEN SIXTY S FOR TWO DIMENSIONAL ELEMENTS OF FASHION THINGS LIKE FABRIC PRINTS OR LACE DESIGNS
POD1000000005_S0000355	OVER ON THE PATENT SIDE WE'VE HAD HISTORICALLY A LITTLE BIT OF PROTECTION FOR SOME FUNCTIONAL ELEMENTS OF FASHION THINGS LIKE ZIPPERS AND VELCROW AND KEVLAR AND SPACE SUITS OR HASMAT SUITS
POD1000000005_S0000356	AND THEN AT THE END OF THE DAY WHAT FASHION REALLY HAS TO RELY ON IS TRADEMARK PROTECTION
POD1000000005_S0000357	ATIS PROTECTION FOR THE LOGO OR LABEL
POD1000000005_S0000358	SO BASICALLY THE POLO PONY ON YOUR CHEST OR THE GIANT DOUBLE G ON YOUR BELT BUCKLE THOSE ARE PROTECTED
POD1000000005_S0000359	THE DESIGN OF THE SHIRT AND BELT THEMSELVES ARE NOT ORIGINAL PRINTS ARE GENERALLY ALSO PROTECTED
POD1000000005_S0000360	WHILE THERE AREN'T A TON OF COPYRIGHT AND TRADEMARK PROTECTIONS FOR FASHION IN THE U S
POD1000000005_S0000361	FOREVER TWENTY ONE HAS STILL FOUND ITSELF INVOLVED IN MANY MANY MANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWSUITS SKAVITI SAYS THEY'RE ONE OF THE MOST EGREGIOUS OFFENDERS IN THE GAME
POD1000000005_S0000362	GOCHI POMA ADITIS ANNA SWI DIANNE VN FURSTENBERG AND GWEN STOFANI HAVE ALL PURSUED LEGAL ACTION AGAINST FOREVER TWENTY ONE ALLEGING VARIOUS FORMS OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT
POD1000000005_S0000363	MANY SMALLER BRANDS HAVE ALSO CLAIMED THEIR PRINTS OR DESIGNS WERE RIPPED OFF BY THE MEGA RETAILER
POD1000000005_S0000364	BUT MOST DIDN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO GO AGAINST A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR MAMMOTH
POD1000000005_S0000365	AND SKIFITI SAYS FAST FASHION BRANDS LIKE FOREVER TWENTY ONE BANK ON THAT
POD1000000005_S0000366	A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF COPYING IS IS BAKED INTO THE BUSINESS MODEL OF EVERY FASH FASHION COMPANY
POD1000000005_S0000367	THE ONLY QUESTION IS HOW LITERALLY THEY'RE COPYING AND HOW MUCH THEY'RE CHANGING IT UP
POD1000000005_S0000368	IN FOREVER TWENTY ONE'S CASE THEY'D OFTEN BARELY BOTHER TO CHANGE ANYTHING ABOUT THE ORIGINAL DESIGN THEY WERE RIPPING OFF
POD1000000005_S0000369	AND SOME OF THEIR FABRIC PRINTS WERE JUST A STRAIGHT CUT AND COPY JOB
POD1000000005_S0000370	AND MAYBE ON THE BACKEND YOU GET CAUGHT AND HAVE TO PAY OUT THE OCCASIONAL SETTLEMENT OR OR PAY SOME LEGAL FEES
POD1000000005_S0000371	BUT USUALLY THAT'S CHEAPER THAN ACTUALLY HIRING DESIGNERS AND ENGAGING IN INNOVATIVE PRODUCT RESEARCH
POD1000000005_S0000372	COPYING CLOTHING DESIGNS HASN'T BEEN FOREVER TWENTY ONE'S ONLY QUESTIONABLE MOVE
POD1000000005_S0000373	IN TWO THOUSAND ONE A WORKERS ADVOCACY CENTER FILED A LAWSUIT ON BEHALF OF EMPLOYEES WHO SAID THEY WERE MADE TO WORK INSANE HOURS FOR WAY LESS THAN MINIMUM WAGE
POD1000000005_S0000374	IN TWENTY TWELVE THE US DEPARTMENT OF LABOUR SUED THE RETAILER FOR FAILING TO PAY FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE TO ITS MANUFACTURERS AND CONTRACTORS
POD1000000005_S0000375	AND IN TWENTY NINETEEN POP STAR ARIANA GRANDE SLAPPED FOREVER TWENTY ONE WITH A TEN MILLION DOLLAR LAWSUIT
POD1000000005_S0000376	THE COMPANY USED A MODEL IN THIS AD CAMPAIGN THAT LOOKED AN AWFUL LOT LIKE ARIANA GRANDE
POD1000000005_S0000377	SHE CLAIMS THEY DID THIS TO CONFUSE CONSUMERS THAT SHE HAD ENDORSED THEM
POD1000000005_S0000378	AND THAT ARIANA GRANDE LOOKED LIKE WAS ME JUST KIDDING
POD1000000005_S0000379	A BAHEMOTH LIKE FOREVER TWENTY ONE RARELY FAILS BECAUSE OF ONE MISSTEP
POD1000000005_S0000380	HOW DID IT FALTER LET US COUNT THE WAYS
POD1000000005_S0000381	HOW ABOUT ROUTINE LEGAL TROUBLES LEASING TOO MUCH EXPENSIVE RETAIL SPACE SCREWYN MERCHANDISING THAT GUMMED UP THEIR SUPPLY CHAIN AND NO TRADITIONAL BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO PUMP THE BRAKES
POD1000000005_S0000382	AND WITH RETAIL MOVING MORE AND MORE ONLINE FOREVER TWENTY ONE'S WEAK ECOMMERCE GAME DIDN'T HELP MATTERS
POD1000000005_S0000383	IN RECENT YEARS THERE'S BEEN ONE OTHER MAJOR ISSUE TUGGING AT FOREVER TWENTY ONE'S FILOUNCY HEM SUSTAINABILITY BECAUSE SUSTAINABLE IT AIN'T
POD1000000005_S0000384	I WONDER IS FAST FASHION IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY LIKE IS THAT JUST AS BAD AS IT CAN GET
POD1000000005_S0000385	WELL I'M I'M HESITANT TO SAY THE WORST BUT I WOULD BE HARD PRESSED TO THINK OF ANOTHER REALM OF THE FASHION INDUSTRY THAT IS AS BAD
POD1000000005_S0000386	BECAUSE FAST FASHION HAS AS ITS FUNDAMENTAL PURPOSE
POD1000000005_S0000387	QUICK DISPOSABILITY
POD1000000005_S0000388	YOU KNOW THE TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS HANDBAG THAT IS A KNOCKOFF OF SOME YOU KNOW ITEM THAT CAME DOWN THE RUNWAY
POD1000000005_S0000389	THAT IS REALLY MEANT TO BE USED FOR A FEW MONTHS AND THEN YOU KNOW CHCKED INTO THE TRASH WILL THAT'S GONG TO END UP IN A LANDFILL
POD1000000005_S0000390	AS OPPOSED TO SAY AN AERMEZ HANDBAG THAT IS THE PRICE OF A SMALL CAR
POD1000000005_S0000391	THAT'S NOT GETTING TOSSED OUT
POD1000000005_S0000392	THAT'S GOING IN THE SAFE DEPOSIT BOX AS INSURANCE FOR THE APOCALYPE
POD1000000005_S0000393	SUSTAINABILITY IN FASHION ISN'T JUST ABOUT BUYING MORE DURABLE CLASSIC HANDBAGS
POD1000000005_S0000394	THE RISE OF ONLINE CONSIGNMENT SHOPPING AS WELL AS CLOTHING RENTAL STARTUPS LIKE RENT THE RUNWAY MEANS CONSUMERS ARE INCREASINGLY TRYING TO BUY USED AND OWN LESS STUFF
POD1000000005_S0000395	A CLOTHING BRAND THAT BANKS ON DISPOSABILITY IS NOT LONG FOR THIS NEW WORLD
POD1000000005_S0000396	BY SEPTEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN IT HAD ALL BECOME JUST TOO MUCH FOR FOREVER TWENTY ONE
POD1000000005_S0000397	THE COMPANY BUILT BY IMMIGRANTS FROM A SINGLE STOREFRONT IN LA INTO A FOUR BILLION DOLLARS COLOSSUS FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY
POD1000000005_S0000398	IT'S THE END OF AN ERA
POD1000000005_S0000399	IF YOU'RE A FAN OF FOREVER TWENTY ONE YOU MAY HAVE TO SAY GOODBYE TO A STORE NEAR YOU

POD1000000011_S0000152	IT WAS A MATH MOMENT AND IT'S WITH MY FAVORITE CHARACTER GROVER
POD1000000011_S0000153	
POD1000000011_S0000154	HE SO HE'S STANDING THERE IN THE FOREGROUND AND HE SAYS
POD1000000011_S0000155	
POD1000000011_S0000156	AND THEN HE GOES WAY BACK HERE
POD1000000011_S0000158	
POD1000000011_S0000160	NE
POD1000000011_S0000162	AR EPIPHANYE
POD1000000011_S0000164	SO THE POINT IS PARENTS GET APPROXIMATELY ONE MILLION BILLION CHANCES ALL DAY LONG EVERY DAY EVERY NIGHT TO TALK ABOUT MATH
POD1000000011_S0000165	THAT IS OF COURSE A ROUGH ESTIMATE BUT THINK ABOUT IT
POD1000000011_S0000166	THEYARE CALENDARS AND CLOCKS MONEY MAPS MEASURING CRAFTS
POD1000000011_S0000167	IT'S VERY BROAD AND I THINK THAT ONCE PARENTS UNDERSTAND THE BREADTH OF HOW WE DEFINE MATH AND HOW THEY ARE ALREADY DOING IT THEY GO OH THAT'S MATH
POD1000000011_S0000168	I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT WAS MATH OH IF THAT'S MATH THEN I COULD DO THAT
POD1000000011_S0000169	SETTING THE TABLE ONE TO ONE CORRESPONDENCE THAT'S MATH ORDINAL NUMBER FIRST SECOND THIRD THAT'S MATH
POD1000000011_S0000170	YEAH AND IF YOU NEED EVEN MORE CHANCES ROLL THE DICE IN OUR NEXT TAKEAWAY TAKEAWAY NUMBER THREE
POD1000000011_S0000171	PLAY MATH
POD1000000011_S0000172	FIND WAYS TO KEEP MATH IN MIND WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING WITH YOUR KIDS SUDA SAYS YOU MAY ALREADY BE DOING THIS
POD1000000011_S0000173	JUST PLAY
POD1000000011_S0000174	AND RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT WHEN PARENTS JUST PLAY THEY'RE ACTUALLY REALLY REALLY GOOD AT PULLING OUT THESE DEEP CONCEPTS FROM CHILDREN MUCH BETTER THAN EVEN TEACHERS
POD1000000011_S0000175	HERE'S SO MANY WAYS TO PLAY MATH WITH KIDS OF ALL DIFFERENT AGES
POD1000000011_S0000176	RIGHT THERE ARE PUZZLES OF COURSE AND BLOCKS LIKE WE HEARD WITH AMY
POD1000000011_S0000177	THERE'S VIDEO GAMES AND APPS CARD GAMES AND ESPECIALLY BOARD GAMES
POD1000000011_S0000178	RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT THE MORE KIDS PLAY ANY GAME WITH DICE AND NUMBERED SQUARES THE BETTER THEIR BASIC MATH SKILLS GET
POD1000000011_S0000179	YOU CAN EVEN PLAY MATH OUTSIDE
POD1000000011_S0000180	I CAN GIVE A BIG PUSH TO THE SWING OR I CAN HOP THREE TIMES TO GO THERE
POD1000000011_S0000181	AT SUDA'S HOUSE HOPSCOTCH HAD NEGATIVE ONE
POD1000000011_S0000183	WHICH WAS KIND OF MINDBLOWING TO ME
POD1000000011_S0000184	
POD1000000011_S0000185	AND SHE SAYS YOU KNOW PLAY CAN BE THE FOUNDATION EVEN OF ADVANCED SUBJECTS LIKE ALGEBRA
POD1000000011_S0000186	ALGEBRA IS YOU KNOW OF ALL THE MATH CONCEPTS ALGEBRA SEEMS TO SHAKE MANY PEOPLE'S NERVES
POD1000000011_S0000187	BUT WHAT IS ALGEBRA REALLY IF YOU THINK ABOUT
POD1000000011_S0000188	IT IS RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE PATTERNS IN NUMBERS THERE ARE PATTERNS IN EQUATIONS AND YOU KNOW YOU YOU'RE TRYING TO BALANCE THE TWO SIDES OF IT
POD1000000011_S0000189	TAKE THIS LITTLE MOMENT IN AMY LOPEZ'S TODDLER ROOM
POD1000000011_S0000190	WHEN YOU PUT YOUR TRIANGLES TOGETHER IT MAKES A SQUARE LOOK
POD1000000011_S0000191	
POD1000000011_S0000192	SAME SAME DHAY MA AA
POD1000000011_S0000194	JUST LIKE THAT ONE YOU MADE ONE A ETANE GREAT DISCOVERY
POD1000000011_S0000195	
POD1000000011_S0000196	EXACTLY SO AS YOU KNOW CORY I HAVE A TWO YEAR OLD AT HOME AND I WAS GETTING SO EXCITED AT THIS POINT
POD1000000011_S0000197	BECAUSE I FELT LIKE HEY I'M READY TO BE THE A PLUS AP EXTRACREDIT MOM
POD1000000011_S0000198	GOINGTO NARRATE EVERY MOMENT OF BLOCK TIME I'M GONGTO USE PERRIMETER AND QUADRADO
POD1000000011_S0000199	RAIN IT IN KAMENITZ
POD1000000011_S0000200	WHAT
POD1000000011_S0000201	COME ON I'M RERING TO GO LET'S GET TO THOSE FLASH CARDS COM ON
POD1000000011_S0000203	REMEMBER SUDA WARNED US
POD1000000011_S0000204	H AND THIS REALLY RINGS TRUE FOR ME
POD1000000011_S0000205	ONE THING I WOULD TELL PARENTS NOT TO DO IS TO BECOME THE TEACHER IN THE HOUSE
POD1000000011_S0000206	ALL RIGHT
POD1000000011_S0000207	I GET THIS
POD1000000011_S0000208	YEAH I MEAN FOR ONE THING IT'S IT'S KIND OF ANNOYING
POD1000000011_S0000209	YOU KNOW WHEN WE PLAY WITH OUR FRIENDS WE'RE NOT CONSTANTLY ASKING THEM LET'S COUNT HOW MANY THERE IS THET'S WHAT IS THE SHAPE WE DON'T DO THAT
POD1000000011_S0000210	SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT I DO WITH MY FRIENDS I I MI QUIZ MY FRIENDS
POD1000000011_S0000212	'T WANT TO HANG OUT WITH YOU
POD1000000011_S0000213	FINE
POD1000000011_S0000214	ALRIGHT THE MOST IMPORTANT REASON TO NOT BE SO HEAVY HANDED WHEN WE'RE PLAYING WITH OUR KIDS IS TAKEAWAY NUMBER FOUR
POD1000000011_S0000215	MATH LIKE LIFE IS SO MUCH MORE INTERESTING AND FUN WHEN WE CAN GET BEYOND RIGHT AND WRONG ANSWERS
POD1000000011_S0000216	FOR EXAMPLE SUDA SAID THIS
POD1000000011_S0000217	WE 'RE SITTING AT A ROUND TABLE AND I COULD ASK YOU ANYA WHAT'S THE SHAPE OF THIS TABLE
POD1000000011_S0000218	I KNOW IT'S A CIRCLE YOU KNOW
POD1000000011_S0000219	MEAN SO IT'S BUT A BETTER QUESTION WOULD BE TO SAY ANYA WHY DID YOU CHOOSE THE CIRCLE FOR OUR TABLE
POD1000000011_S0000220	THAT IS BETTER BECAUSE SHE'S ACTUALLY INTERESTED IN MY ANSWER SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY
POD1000000011_S0000221	I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU DID THAT RIGHT BUT THAT GETS US TALKING ABOUT SHAPES
POD1000000011_S0000222	IT'S A REAL CONVERSATION
POD1000000011_S0000223	YES AND IT'S THE KIND OF CONVERSATION THAT YOU COULD HAVE WITH KIDS AT ALMOST ANY AGE
POD1000000011_S0000224	OR ANOTHER INTERESTING QUESTION SUDA SAYS MIGHT BE HOW DO YOU KNOW THE TABLE IS ROUND
POD1000000011_S0000225	IT'S GOING TO MAKE THEM LOOK UP THAT CIRCLE ONE MORE TIME AND TO SEE THAT YOU KNOW THIS IT FEELS CURVY AND THE OTHER ONE FEELS SHARP ON THE EDGE
POD1000000011_S0000226	SO THE KEY HERE IS TO KEEP THINGS OPEN ENDED
POD1000000011_S0000227	SO WE SAW ANOTHER GREAT EXAMPLE OF THIS IN ONE OF THE OTHER PRE SCHOOL CLASSROOMS THERE'S A FOUR YEAR OLD BOY NAMED AKILLEYS KIND OF MESSING AROUND WITH SOME BLOCKS
POD1000000011_S0000228	AND THE TEACHER CARLA ALAMO WAS A MASTER SHE JUST BACKED OFF AND LET HIM DO HIS THING BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING
POD1000000011_S0000229	'S HE'S TRYING THINGS OUT HE'S TESTING OUT HYPOTHESES
POD1000000011_S0000230	THIS IS DATA IT'S PROBABILITY
POD1000000011_S0000231	IT'S NOT ABOUT GETTING TO A CERTAIN PLACE IN THE END
POD1000000011_S0000232	DO YOU WANT THE WHEEL TO GO UNDER IT OR OVER IT
POD1000000011_S0000233	O
POD1000000011_S0000234	ERNE
POD1000000011_S0000235	EAH AND REMEMBER THIS IS PLAY IT'S OPEN ENDD
POD1000000011_S0000236	HERE'S NO RIGHT OR WRONG SHE'S LETTING HIM FIGURE IT OUT
POD1000000011_S0000237	DO WE NEED TO CHANGE ANY BLOCKS OR ADD ANYTHING TO MAKE IT JUMP HIGHER
POD1000000011_S0000239	ROSEMARY SAYS THERE'S A SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL POINT WE'RE MAKING THAT GOES DEEPER EVEN THAN THE MATHE
POD1000000011_S0000240	THERE SHOULD BE NO FEAR IN MAKING A MISTAKE
POD1000000011_S0000241	LET'S SAY THAT AGAIN NO FEAR IN MAKING A MISTAKE
POD1000000011_S0000242	THAT'S BASICALLY HOW CHILDREN LEARN IT'S ALL TRIAL AND ERROR FOR THEM
POD1000000011_S0000243	AND THEY'RE ALSO LOOKING TO US HOW WE REACT TO MAKING A MISTAKE AND THAT'S PART OF RESILIENCY
POD1000000011_S0000244	AND IT'S REALLY HELPFUL TO COMMUNICATE THIS ATTITUDE WHEN OUR KIDS ARE A LITTLE OLDER LIKE MINE ARE AND THEY'RE LEARNING MATH IN SCHOOL ON SOMEBODY ELSE'S SCHEDULE
POD1000000011_S0000245	YEAH I MEAN THE PRESSURE JUST GETS HIGHER FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND SO THE MOST HELPFUL THAT WE CAN BE AS PARENTS IS NOT TO BE FROG MARCHING THEM THROUGH THEIR HOMEWORK BUT TRY TO MAKE IT FEEL OKAY TO MESS UP SOMETIMES AND ALSO TO KEEP GOING
POD1000000011_S0000246	BECAUSE IT'S ALL PART OF THE PROCESS
POD1000000011_S0000247	YEAH FAILURE IS IMPORTANT WHICH IS A LESSON THE COUNT HAD TO LEARN
POD1000000011_S0000248	OH I CANNOT BELIEVE IT I THE COUNT MADE A COUNTING MISTAKE
POD1000000011_S0000249	JUST A LITTLE ONE OH THA
POD1000000011_S0000250	SO AS WE SAID IN THE BEGINNING YOU KNOW HE MESSED UP IT WASN'T HIS FAULT
POD1000000011_S0000251	DECIDES TO QUIT BEING THE COUNT
POD1000000011_S0000252	YEAH AND HE GOES IN SEARCH OF OTHER EMPLOYMENT
POD1000000011_S0000253	ALLRIGHT CONSTRUCTION WORKING ALLRIGHT WE'RE GOINNA HAVE TO HAMMER FIVE NAILS INTO THIS HERE BEAM
POD1000000011_S0000254	
POD1000000011_S0000255	TURNS OUT THERE'S THINGS YU GOT TO COUNT IN DOING CONSTRUCTION AND MEASURING AND ALL THIS KIND OF STUFF SO THERE'S NO ESCAPING IT THERE
POD1000000011_S0000256	AGAIN THIS'S KENN SCARBORO THE HEAD WRITER AT SESSAMI
POD1000000011_S0000257	SO HE LEFT THAT HE BECAME A ROCKET GUY THEY HAVE TO COUNT DOWN
POD1000000011_S0000258	TEN OH NINE
POD1000000011_S0000260	AND WHAT FINALLY GETS THE COUNTBACK ON TRACK IS ACTUALLY ANOTHER MISTAKE
POD1000000011_S0000261	HIS FRIEND ELMO STEPS IN AND PRETENDS TO MESS UP HIS OWN COUNTING JUST TO HELP THE COUNT KNOW THAT IT'S OKAY TO MESS
POD1000000011_S0000262	SIX SEN N EIGHT NI

POD1000000012_S0000111	AND WE'RE GOING TO FINISH OUR CONVO WITH COOKIEMONSTER IN JUST A FEW MINUTES
POD1000000012_S0000112	BUT FIRST WE SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE IT'S PRETTY SURPRISING THAT COOKIES BECOME SO SKILLED AT SELF REGULATION
POD1000000012_S0000113	SO I REMEMBER AS A CHILD WATCHING COOKIE MONSTER AND JUST BEING LIKE WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS MANIAC
POD1000000012_S0000115	THAT'S KINTARO FUJITA AN EXPERT ON SELF REGULATION WHO WE'LL TALK TO IN A BIT
POD1000000012_S0000116	YEAH I HAVE TO AGREE ANYA THE COOKIE WE GREW UP WITH
POD1000000012_S0000117	OWA BUNGA
POD1000000012_S0000119	WAS PURE
POD1000000012_S0000121	OKAY
POD1000000012_S0000123	OKAY
POD1000000012_S0000125	BUT ROSEMARIE FROM SESSAMY SAYS COOKIE'S TRANSFORMATION WAS ACTUALLY REALLY REALLY INTENTIONAL
POD1000000012_S0000126	SESAMY STREET EVERY YEAR WE FOCUS ON A CRITICAL EDUCATIONAL NEED IN CHILDREN'S LIVES
POD1000000012_S0000127	AND IT WAS ABOUT SEVEN EIGHT YEARS AGO WHEN ALL OF THIS RESEARCH STARTED TO COME OUT SHOWING THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE SELF REGULATION SKILLS AND HOW THEY WERE RELATED TO SCHOOL ACHIEVEMENT SCHOOL READINESS AND LIFE LESSONS
POD1000000012_S0000129	AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHY WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THIS TODAY
POD1000000012_S0000130	YEAH AND SESAMY DECIDED ONCE THEY KNEW ALL OF THIS THAT COOKIE MONSTER WAS THE PERFECT MUPPET TO SEND THIS MESSAGE
POD1000000012_S0000131	LET'S NOT DEFINE HIM AS THIS IMPULSIVE CHARACTER WHO HAS NO SELF CONTROL BECAUSE HE CAN HAVE SELF CONTROL
POD1000000012_S0000132	SO AFTER
POD1000000012_S0000134	YEARS
POD1000000012_S0000135	COOKIE EVOLVES
POD1000000012_S0000136	E
POD1000000012_S0000137	AND HE BECOMES SOMEONE WHO WAS
POD1000000012_S0000138	IS MUCH MORE REFLECTIVE WHO CAN ACTUALLY STOP AND PAUSE AND CONTROL HIS EMOTION AND HIS DESIRE FOR EATING THE COOKIE RIGHT AWAY
POD1000000012_S0000139	THAT'S INSPIRING ROSEMARIE
POD1000000012_S0000140	YES IT IS
POD1000000012_S0000142	IT'S INSPIRING FOR ME AS A FORTY TWO YEAR OLD THAT I HAVE ONE MORE YEAR TO GET ALL MY SELF CONTROL TOGETHER
POD1000000012_S0000143	I BELIEVE IN YOU
POD1000000012_S0000144	OHWELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH SESAMY'S HOPE HERE WAS
POD1000000012_S0000145	THAT WE COULD MODEL THESE STRATEGIES FOR CHILDREN TO LEARN AND APPLY THESE STRATEGIES AND BUILD THEIR OWN SELF REGULATION TOOLBOX
POD1000000012_S0000146	AND SEVERAL YEARS AGO SESMI PACKED A STUDY TO SEE IF THIS COULD REALLY WORK
POD1000000012_S0000147	AND SO SOME OF THE KIDS IN THE STUDY WATCHED VIDEOS OF COOKIE MONSTER PRACTICING HIS STRATEGIES KIND OF LIKE YOEU HEARD AT THE TOP OF THE PODCAST
POD1000000012_S0000148	E GOT NEW STRATEGY
POD1000000012_S0000150	THEN ROSEMARI SAYS THE RESEARCHER TEMPTED ALL THE KIDS WITH THEIR FAVORITE SNACK
POD1000000012_S0000151	CHOCOLATE CHIPPES
POD1000000012_S0000153	AND THE KIDS WHO WATCHED COOKIE MONSTER
POD1000000012_S0000154	ON AVERAGE WAITED FOUR ADDITIONAL MINUTES
POD1000000012_S0000155	FOUR MINUTES THAT IS HUGE FOR A PRESCHOOLER
POD1000000012_S0000156	UGE
POD1000000012_S0000158	SO LET'S BREAK THIS DOWN FOR A MINUT
POD1000000012_S0000159	
POD1000000012_S0000160	WHAT DOES NOT EATING COOKIES HAVE TO DO WITH BEING SUCCESSFUL IN SCHOOL OR IN YOUR LIFE
POD1000000012_S0000161	ROSEMARY EXPLAINED THAT SELF REGULATION ISN'T JUST ABOUT TREATS SELF REGULATION IS A SET OF SKILLS THAT HELPS US REACH OUR GOALS
POD1000000012_S0000162	SPECIFICALLY WE NEED TO EITHER MONITOR OR CHANGE OR REDIRECT OUR THOUGHTS FEELINGS AND BEHAVIOR TOWARDS A PARTICULAR GOAL THAT WE'VE CHOSEN
POD1000000012_S0000163	EAHAND WITHIN SELF REGULATION YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR US TALK A LOT IN THIS EPISODE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT SELF CONTROL WHICH IS EITHER RESISTING AN IMPULSE OR OVERCOMING A TEMPTATION ON THE WAY TO A GOAL
POD1000000012_S0000164	O SELF CONTROL MEANS MORE THAN RESISTING A COOKIE
POD1000000012_S0000165	IT MEANS NOT HITTING A CLASSMATE ON THE PLAYGROUND WHEN HE TAKES YOUR TRICYCLE
POD1000000012_S0000166	IT MEANS WORKING THROUGH YOUR MATH HOMEWORK AND NOT THROWING A TANTRUM WHEN YOU GET STUMPED
POD1000000012_S0000167	YEAH IT CAN EVEN MEAN WORKING THROUGH A BIG FEAR THAT YOU HAVE WHEN IT OVERWHELMS YOU
POD1000000012_S0000168	AND ALL OF THIS IS A BIG DEAL RIGHT NOW NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE NEW RESEARCH THAT ROSEMARY REFERENCED BUT ALSO BECAUSE THERE'SE JUST MORE AND MORE KIDS OUT THERE WITH DIAGNOSED ISSUES THAT CAN INTERFERE WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF SELF REGULATION
POD1000000012_S0000169	THINGS LIKE CHILDHOOD TRAUMA ADH D OR BEING ON THE AUTISM SPECTRUM
POD1000000012_S0000170	ALSO MANY PARENTS ESPECIALLY PRIVILEGED PARENTS ARE BASICALLY STEPPING INTO THEIR KIDS LIVES TO SMOOTH OVER THEIR KIDS PATHS AND REMOVE ANY SOURCES OF FRUSTRATION REALLY BEFORE THEIR KIDS HAVE A CHANCE TO LEARN HOW TO DEAL WITH IT
POD1000000012_S0000171	I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CORY
POD1000000012_S0000172	APPRECIATE YOUR HONESTY EAH
POD1000000012_S0000173	I MEAN I CAN SEE THAT THIS IS VERY WELL MEANING AND A LOT OF PARENTS JUST WANT THE BEST FOR THEIR KIDS IN A REALLY COMPETITIVE WORLD
POD1000000012_S0000174	BUT WHAT WE'RE DOING ALSO DEPRIVES THEM OF THE NATURAL OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE TO LEARN SELF REGULATION ALONG THE WAY
POD1000000012_S0000175	AND THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON IN IN IN CHILDREN'S LIVES RIGHT NOW THAT THEY ARE BECOMING RISK AVERSE
POD1000000012_S0000176	THEY WANT EVERYTHING DONE FOR THEM
POD1000000012_S0000177	AND SO SESAMY DECIDED TO SEND THE MESSAGE THAT YOU KNOW IF COOKIE MONSTER CAN LEARN TO CONTROL HIMSELF ANYBODY CAN
POD1000000012_S0000178	BUT I WAS KIND OF SKEPTICAL COREY I WANTED TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE SCIENCE OF THIS RIG
POD1000000012_S0000179	BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY I SEE THAT MY KIDS AS THEY GROW UP THEY GET BETTER AT SELF REGULATION MY TWO YEAR OLD IS NOT AS GOOD AT WAITING AS MY SEVEN YEAR OLD
POD1000000012_S0000180	
POD1000000012_S0000181	SO YOU KNOW IS THIS REALLY SOMETHING I NEED TO COACH MY KIDS ON IS THIS LIKE DO I HAVETO SEND THEM TO SELF CONTROL SUMMER CAMP
POD1000000012_S0000183	YES AND NO
POD1000000012_S0000184	SOME OF THE VARIATION IS GENETIC AND AND YOU'RE RIGHT THAT CHILDREN'S BRAINS DO NATURALLY DEVELOP ALONG THESE LINES
POD1000000012_S0000185	BUT KEN FUJITA WHO WE HEARD FROM EARLIER WHO SAID COOKIE MONSTER WAS A MANIAC
POD1000000012_S0000186	
POD1000000012_S0000187	HE HAPPENS TO BE A PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY AT THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY NAND HE DESCRIBES IT THIS WAY
POD1000000012_S0000188	SO THE BRAIN YOU CAN THINK OF AS BEING LIKE THE HARDWARE
POD1000000012_S0000189	BUT EVEN WHEN WE HAVE THE HARDWARE WE STILL NEED TO LEARN HOW TO USE THE HARDWARE WITH THE RIGHT SOFTWARE
POD1000000012_S0000190	SO BY SOFTWARE KEN'S TALKING ABOUT THE SKILLS AND THE STRATEGIES THAT PARENTS CAN HELP KIDS PRACTICE TO IMPROVE THEIR SELF REGULATE
POD1000000012_S0000191	EXACTLY
POD1000000012_S0000192	THERE IS A LOT OF RESEARCH SUPPORTING VERY SPECIFIC INTERVENTIONS SO WITHOUT MAKING EVERYBODY WAIT ANY LONGER LET'S OPEN UP THE TOOLBOX AND GET RIGHT TO OUR TAKEAWAYS
POD1000000012_S0000194	ALL RIGHT AND TAKEAWAY NUMBER ONE IS BIG PICTURE ADVICE FOR US PARENTS
POD1000000012_S0000196	WE NEED TO START THINKING OF SELF REGULATION AS A SKILL TO BE PRACTICED
POD1000000012_S0000197	EXACTLY
POD1000000012_S0000198	SO THIS PART MADE ME THINK ABOUT WHEN MY HUSBAND WAS TEACHING OUR OLDER DAUGHTER LULU TO SKI RIGHT
POD1000000012_S0000199	O FIRST SHE WAS KIND OF FREAKED OUT THE MOUNTAIN IS BIG
POD1000000012_S0000200	SHE IS SMALL IT IS COLD
POD1000000012_S0000201	AND HE HAD TO BEGIN BY REALLY ACKNOWLEDGING ALL OF THE BIG FEELINGS THAT SHE WAS HAVING AND ROSEMARY SAYS WE SHOULD DO THE SAME THING WHEN WE'RE WORKING ON A SKILL
POD1000000012_S0000202	YOU NEED TO VALIDATE CHILDREN'S EMOTIONS I KNOW IT'S HARD
POD1000000012_S0000203	I KNOW IT'S HARD THE WORST THING TO BE IS LIKE YOU NO OH IT'S EASYOU DON'T WORRY YSO NO
POD1000000012_S0000204	SO YOU'VE DONE THAT EMPATHIZING AND THEN YOU HAVE TO MOVE ON TO THE NUTS AND BOLTS
POD1000000012_S0000205	WHAT IS IT THAT YOU ACTUALLY DO YOU KNOW YOU DON'T JUST TELL THE KID SKI DOWN THE HILL AND YOU DON'T JUST TELL A KID CONTROL YOURSELF
POD1000000012_S0000206	YEAH DON'T DON'T THROW A TANTRUM
POD1000000012_S0000207	
POD1000000012_S0000208	DOESN'T WORK YOU CAN'T DO IT THAT AY
POD1000000012_S0000209	SO WHEN YOU'RE SKIING YOU BREAK DOWN THE SKILL INTO TINY PIECES AND THERE 'RSE STRATEGIES THAT YOU CAN USE FOR EACH ONE
POD1000000012_S0000210	FOR EXAMPLE WHEN YOU WANT TO SLOW DOWN YOU POINT THE TES TOWARDS EACH OTHER AND THE THE CODEWORD FOR THAT IS PIZZA OK
POD1000000012_S0000211	YOUR IT'S A SLICE OF PIZA THE TWO SKIS COMING TOGETHER
POD1000000012_S0000212	THANK YOU LIFE KIT SKIEING
POD1000000012_S0000213	YES NOW THE ANALOGY HERE IS WE'RE TAKING SELF REGULATION OR SELF CONTROL THESE BIG BIG CONCEPTS AND WE'RE BREAKING THEM DOWN INTO VERY SPECIFIC STRATEGIES THAT WE WANT OUR KIDS TO TRY
POD1000000012_S0000214	RIGHT AND THE OTHER KEY THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT OUR KIDS ARE GOING TO FAIL AND PROBABLY FAIL A LOT
POD1000000012_S0000215	
POD1000000012_S0000216	BEFORE THEY SUCCEED AND AND WE REALLY HAVE TO NOT ONLY ACCEPT THAT FAILURE BUT PRAISE THEIR EFFORT EVERY CHANCE WE GET
POD1000000012_S0000217	SO EVEN IF IT IS I JUST WAITED A MINUTE PRAISE THE EFFORT I WAITED A MINUTE
POD1000000012_S0000218	YEAH AND NEXT TIME MAYBE THEY'LL AIT TWO MINUTES
POD1000000012_S0000219	TOTALLY AND HERE'S THE THING I MEAN OBVIOUSLY NOT EVERY KID NEEDS TO LEARN TO SKI BUT EVERY KID NEEDS TO LEARN TO REGULATE THEIR EMOTIONS
POD1000000012_S0000220	AND THEY CAN AS LONG AS THEY HAVE A COACH
POD1000000012_S0000221	YEAH SO LET'S LET'S LOOK AT SELF CONTROL AGAIN WHAT IS THE FIRST STEP TO NOT HITTING YOUR FRIEND OR NOT THROWING YOUR HOMEWORK ACROSS THE ROOM
POD1000000012_S0000222	TYING YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK
POD1000000012_S0000224	A BETTER WAY IS NOT GETTING SO MAD IN THE FIRST PLACE
POD1000000012_S0000225	AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO START HERE WHEN IT COMES TO TEACHING OUR KIDS TO REGULATE THEIR EMOTIONS BECAUSE IT'S SELF REGULATION RIGHT
POD1000000012_S0000226	SO TAKEAWAY NUMBER TWO YELLING CALM DOWN AT YOUR KIDS WHEN THEY GET REALLY WORKED UP THAT DOESN'T WORK
POD1000000012_S0000227	YEAH I KNOW THIS BECAUSE I'VE TRIED IT
POD1000000012_S0000229	HAVE TRIED IT TOO MANY TIMES
POD1000000012_S0000230	I MEAN IT'S JUST REALLY COMMON TO RESPOND TO OUR KIDS FRUSTRATION WITH OUR OWN FRUSTRATION
POD1000000012_S0000231	BUT THERE IS SOMETHING THAT CAN HELP BOTH OF US AS LONG AS WE'RE CONSISTENT BOTH OUR KIDS AND OURSELVES AND THAT IS OUR SLOW DEEP BREATHING
POD1000000012_S0000232	BELLY BREATHING COMES IN SO TAKING THOSE DEEP SLOW BREATHS IN AND OUT
POD1000000012_S0000234	JUST LIKE I DID WITH COOKIE MONSTER I KNOW IT WAS SILLY AND PROBABLY SOUNDED A LITTLE RIDICULOUS
POD1000000012_S0000235	BUT IT WORKS I DO IT AT HOME I DO IT AT WORK
POD1000000012_S0000236	YOU CAN ASK ALL OF THE LIFEKIT PRODUCERS IT WORKS
POD1000000012_S0000237	AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE IT A HABIT
POD1000000012_S0000238	AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S NOT ALL CORY
POD1000000012_S0000239	YOU CAN TEACH OUR KID TO HUG A PILLOW OR A STUFFED ANIMAL TO CALM DOWN YOU CAN ALSO TRY THIS CRAFT
POD1000000012_S0000240	OKY TAKE A JAR FILL IT WITH GLUE WATER AND GLITTER
POD1000000012_S0000241	AND THEN MAKE SURE YOU SCREW THE LID ON REALLY TIGHT THAT'S IMPORTANT
POD1000000012_S0000243	AND WHENEVER THEY'RE FEELING STRESSD OUT YOU CAN TELL YOUR KIDS TO GIVE THAT JAR A SHAKE
POD1000000012_S0000244	I KNOW I'M OVERWHELMED RIGHT NOW BUT LET ME JUST BREATHE AND FOCUS ON HOW THAT GLITTER IS SWIRLING AROUND WHICH REPRESENTS MY FEELINGS RIGHT NOW
POD1000000012_S0000245	BUT IF I BELLY BREATHE AND WATCH THE GLITTER SETTLE IT GIVES ME THE TIME TO CALM DOWN
POD1000000012_S0000247	ALLRIGHT SO BELLY BREATHING GLITTER JARS OUR NEXT TAKEAWAY ZEROS IN VERY SPECIFICALLY ON SELF CONTROL
POD1000000012_S0000248	THAT'S RIGHT TAKE AWAY NUMBER THREE PRETEND THE COOKIE IS PLASTIC
POD1000000012_S0000250	ALL RIGHT SO YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD OF THE MARSHMELLO TEST
POD1000000012_S0000251	IT WAS A FAMOUS STUDY THAT WAS DONE WHERE CHILDREN WERE OFFERED A MARSHMELLOW TO EAT
POD1000000012_S0000252	AND THEY WERE TOLD THEY COULD EAT IT RIGHT AWAY BUT IF THEY WAITED THEY COULD HAVE TWO OF THE TREATS LATER
POD1000000012_S0000253	YEAH SO THIS STUDY IS SO FAMOUS IF YOU JUST GO TO YOUTUBE AND TYPE IN MARSHMELLOW TEST YOU'LL FIND ALL KINDS OF VIDEOS OF KIDS BEING SUBJECTED TO THIS SORT OF TORMENT
POD1000000012_S0000254	I'M GONNA GO DO SOMETHING AND THEN I'LL COME BACK
POD1000000012_S0000255	I'S LUMM YUMMY
POD1000000012_S0000257	FEE REALLY GOOD
POD1000000012_S0000258	THE EXPERIMENT HAS BEEN REPEATED MANY MANY TIMES SINCE IT WAS FIRST DONE BY WALTER MICHELL IN THE LATE NINETEEN SIXTY S
POD1000000012_S0000259	AND THERE HAS BEEN SOME CONTROVERSY OVER WHAT IT EXACTLY PROVED ESPECIALLY WITH SOME OF THE LONG TERM OUTCOMES AND WHEN YOU TAKE FACTORS LIKE SOCIAL CLASS INTO CONSIDERATION
POD1000000012_S0000260	YES ABSOLUTELY BUT AT THE SAME TIME THAT BASIC EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN WITH KIDS AND TREATS AND A TIMER
POD1000000012_S0000261	IT'S A REALLY GOOD CONTEXT TO SEE THE STRATEGIES THAT CHILDREN CAN AND DO USE WHEN THEIR SELF CONTROL IS BEING TESTED
POD1000000012_S0000262	WHAT SEEMS TO LEAD KIDS TO BE TEMPTED BY THE SMALLER IMMEDIATE REWARD THE ONE MARSHMELLOW IS THE FACT THAT THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT IT IN A HOT WAY
POD1000000012_S0000263	AND BY HOT KEN FUJITA MEANS INTENSE OR URGENT SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO ACT ON RIGHT NOW BUT HE SAYS
POD1000000012_S0000264	IF KIDS COULD FIND DIFFERENT WAYS TO COOL THEIR THOUGHTS THEY WERE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO WAIT OUT THE DELAY
POD1000000012_S0000265	AND THAT KNOWING THESE STRATEGIES SEEMED TO PREDICT WHICH KIDS WERE ABLE TO DELAY AND WHICH ONES WERE NOT
POD1000000012_S0000266	FOR EXAMPLE KIDS PRETENDED THE MARSHMELLOS WERE JUST PUFFY CLOUDS OR THAT THEY WERE LOOKING AT THE MARSHMELLOS THROUGH A PICTURE FRAME
POD1000000012_S0000267	WHAT I REALLY LIKE ABOUT THIS CORY IS THAT KIDS ARE USING A STRENGTH OR IMAGINATIONS TO OVERCOME THEIR WEAKNESS IN SELF CONTROL OR DELAYING GRATIFICATION
POD1000000012_S0000268	AND ROSEMARYE TOLD US THAT PRACTICING THESE STRATEGIES AND LEARNING THEM LEARNING ABOUT THEM CAN BE REALLY EMPOWERING AND ACTUALLY THERAPEUTIC ESPECIALLY FOR KIDS WHO STRUGGLE WITH SELF REGULATION
POD1000000012_S0000269	YEAH AND ALL THE EXPERTS TOLD US IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THAT PRACTICE NOT ONLY HAPPEN IN MOMENTS OF CRISIS BUT YOU REALLY LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR IT SO THAT WHEN THOSE HOT FEELINGS ARISE THEY TURN TO THE STRATEGY AND USE IT
POD1000000012_S0000270	YOU PLANT IT AND THEN IT PAYS
POD1000000012_S0000271	THEN IT PAYS OFF LATER EXACTLY
POD1000000012_S0000273	NOW TAKEAWAY NUMBER FOUR SPEAKING OF IMAGINATION THIS IS MY FAVORITE TAKEAWAY
POD1000000012_S0000275	I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS ONE WHAT WOULD BAD MAN DO
POD1000000012_S0000276	YEAH KEN REGITA TOLD US ABOUT A FASCINATING STUDY
POD1000000012_S0000277	IT'S A VARIATION ON THE MARSH MELLO TEST WHERE RESEARCHERS ASKED KIDS TO DO A VERY BORING TASK WHILE THEY WERE SIMULTANEOUSLY TEMPTED TO PLAY A FUN VIDEO GAME AT THE SAME TIME
POD1000000012_S0000278	BUT THEN
POD1000000012_S0000279	THEY ASKED KIDS TO TO IDENTIFY THEIR FAVORITE SUPERHERO
POD1000000012_S0000280	AND THIS IS SO NEAT WE TALKED ABOUT THIS IN A PREVIOUS EPISODE IG
POD1000000012_S0000281	TH CHARACTERS LIKE SUPERHEROES OR PRINCESSES THEY'RE SO POWERFUL FOR KIDS WHOSE SELF IMAGES ARE REALLY JUST STARTING TO FORM
POD1000000012_S0000282	SO IF KIDS SAID BATTMAN FOR EXAMPLE THEY WOULD GET A BATMAN MASK AND A BATMAN CAPE
POD1000000012_S0000283	I'M BADMAN ING
POD1000000012_S0000285	THEN THE KIDS WERE TOLD WHILE THEY WERE WAITING OUT THE DELAY THEY SHOULD ASK THEMSELVES THE QUESTION WHAT WOULD BAT MAN DO
POD1000000012_S0000286	AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS REALLY STARTLING
POD1000000012_S0000287	SO THE KIDS WHO WERE CHANNELING THEIR HEROES WERE MUCH MORE ABLE TO RESIST THE TEMPTATION
POD1000000012_S0000288	I LOVE THIS ANDI'M TOTALLY GOING TO USE THIS ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW IT'S A PROBLEM BECAUSE LIKE FOR ME IT WOULDN'T BE THE NORMAL BAT IT WOULD B
POD1000000012_S0000290	COREY LOOK OVER THERE IT'S A BRIGHT
POD1000000012_S0000292	WHAT

POD1000000013_S0000014	AND MY EARLY
POD1000000013_S0000016	EARLY CHILDHOOD ADULT LIFE AND INTO MY TIME AT UNIVERSITY WAS VERY MUCH A TIME OF CONFLICT IN NORTHERN IRELAND
POD1000000013_S0000017	I CAME FROM A VERY RELIGIOUS BACKGROUND WHERE VALUES WERE VERY IMPORTANT
POD1000000013_S0000018	SO THERE WAS A WILLINGNESS AND A DESIRE ON THE PART OF MY MOM AND DAD TO BRING US UP REGARDLESS TO RESPECT EVERYBODY AND TO RESPECT EVERYONE'S VIEWS AND RELIGION
POD1000000013_S0000020	THAT'S INTERESTING AND THAT REALLY ANTICIPATES THE FOLLOW UP QUESTION WHICH IS WHAT DO YOU LEARN AND TAKE FROM THOSE AWFUL SITUATIONS
POD1000000013_S0000021	THE NEED FOR FAIRNESS IS VERY IS VERY IMPORTANT PART OF COMMUNITIES GETTING GETTING ON TOGETHER
POD1000000013_S0000022	IF ONE COMMUNITY FEELS THEY'VE BEEN DEALT WITH UNFAIRLY OR ONE INDEED ONE INDIVIDUAL OR A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS THAT THAT IS YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY DESTABILIZING FOR SOCIETY AND FOR THAT COMMUNITY
POD1000000013_S0000023	SO I REALIZED VERY EARLY ON SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS PROBABLY PART OF MY NATURE WHICH IS THIS DESIRE FOR FAIRNESS
POD1000000013_S0000025	DOES THAT EXPLAIN WHY YOU TOOK A LAW DEGREE
POD1000000013_S0000026	IN PART ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I' I'VE SPOKEN ABOUT OPENLY IS THE FACT THAT I WAS IN YOU KNOW A CONVENT SCHOOL
POD1000000013_S0000027	AND I WAS THERE AS A PARTICULAR DAY I WAS CALLED OUT AT ASSEMBLY
POD1000000013_S0000028	I WAS TWELVE THIRTEEN AND I WAS HUGELY HUMILIATED AND EMBARRASSED BY THE FACT THAT I WAS BEING ACCUSED OF STEALING ANOTHER CURLES JIM SHUWES WHEN I HADN'T
POD1000000013_S0000029	IT WAS A MISTAKE AND THAT MISTAKE CAME OUT BUT I REMEMBER THAT THAT FEELING
POD1000000013_S0000030	I THINK THAT WAS THE MORE CATHARTIC MOMENT IF YOU LIKE THE FEELING OF IT'S NOT I WAS ON MY OWN
POD1000000013_S0000031	AND I WAS DEALT WITH UNFAIRLY AND I WANTED TO BE A LAWYER BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO HELP PEOPLE THAT WERE TREATED UNFAIRLY
POD1000000013_S0000032	OTHATTHAT'S WHAT MADE ME WANT TO BE A LAWYER REALLY
POD1000000013_S0000033	OKAY

POD1000000013_S0000041	BEFORE THEN I WAS I WORKED FOR THE THE HOUSING AUTHORITY
POD1000000013_S0000042	I WORKED FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS IN THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT OF THE HOUSING AUTHORITY DEALING WITH INTRACTABLE PROBLEMS SUCH AS ANTI SOCIAL BEHAVIOR HOMELESSNESS FRACTURED COMMUNITIES WHO HAD TO BE HOUSED NEAR TO EACH OTHER

POD1000000013_S0000046	OU KNOW I RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR FOR FREEDOM OF INFORMATION AND FOR PEOPLE'S INFORMATION TO BE PROTECTED
POD1000000013_S0000047	AND I REALLY I LOVED MY TIME IN THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE I WAS THERE FIVE YEARS
POD1000000013_S0000048	AND YOU SPENT SOME OF IT NIN MANCHESTER

POD1000000013_S0000053	E
POD1000000013_S0000054	AND IT WAS A TIME OF EMERGING FROM YOU KNOW THE OFFICE WAS CHANGING FROM BEING THE DATA PROTECTION COMMISSIONER A KIND OF A REGISTRATION FUNCTION
POD1000000013_S0000055	HAD TAKEN ON FREEDOM OF INFORMATION WHICH WAS SO EXCITING
POD1000000013_S0000056	AND IT WAS ABOUT THE OFFICE GETTING GEARED UP FOR FREEDOM OF INFORMATION AND INDEED HAVING REGIONAL OFFICES
POD1000000013_S0000057	THE ONE IN NORTHERN IRELAND I ACTUALLY HELPED ESTABLISH THAT OFFICE
POD1000000013_S0000058	AND WHEN DID YOU BECOME AN OMBUDSMAN
POD1000000013_S0000059	O IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE SO AFTER LEAVING THE ICO I WENT BACK TO PRIVATE PRACTICE
POD1000000013_S0000060	I WORKED IN A COMMERCIAL LAW FIRM AND THEN REALIZED THAT REALLY WASN'T FOR ME THAT I WAS MUCH MORE I D MY MY MAIN INTEREST WAS SOCIAL JUSTICE
POD1000000013_S0000061	O I SAW THE ROLE OF DEPUTY OMBUDSMAN AND I THOUGHT THAT'S INTERESTING I THINK I'L I'LL PUT MY HAT IN THE RING FOR THAT
POD1000000013_S0000062	AND YEAH I WAS LUCKY I GOT THE JOB
POD1000000013_S0000063	AND YOU ERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO WORK FOR THE LEGENDARY TOM FRAWLEY
POD1000000013_S0000064	DR FROWLEY YEAH HE'S HE'S BEEN A HUGE SUPPORT TO ME THROUGHOUT MY CAREER AND I'VE YOU KNOW NA MENTOR
POD1000000013_S0000065	ANDYETS LEGENDARY
POD1000000013_S0000066	E WE'RE TALKING EARLIER TODAY ABOUT LEADERSHIP AND HIS FAMOUS PHRASE ON LEADERSHIP IS I AM THEIR LEADER WHICH WAY DID THEY GO
POD1000000013_S0000068	O IT'S KIND OF YOU KNOW FOR TO BE A LEADER YOU NEED TO T HAVE FOLLOWERS
POD1000000013_S0000069	ABSOLUTELY
POD1000000013_S0000070	OKAY SO FOR OUR ENGLISH LISTENERS AND FOR THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES NORTHERN IRELAND IS OBVIOUSLY UNIQUE POLITICALLY AND SOCIALLY
POD1000000013_S0000071	BUT I DON'T THINK THAT MANY OF US HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THIS MUST HAVE IMPACTED ON YOUR WORK AS AN OMBUDSMAN
POD1000000013_S0000072	COULD YOU SAY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT
POD1000000013_S0000073	WELL I THINK BECAUSE THE FIRST OMBUDSMAN'S OFFICE IN NORTHERN IRELAND WAS CREATED IN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE SO WE ARE WEARE CELEBRATING OUR FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY YEAR THIS YEAR
POD1000000013_S0000074	WAS IT WAS CREATED TO DEAL WITH COMPLAINTS OF DISCRIMINATION IN HOUSING EMPLOYMENT PARTICULARLY IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT
POD1000000013_S0000075	ITHINK THAT THE GENESIS THE IDEA FOR AN OMBUDSMAN WAS TO BRING FAIRNESS TO THE CITIZEN
POD1000000013_S0000076	AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S REALLY BEEN ALWAYS A KEY ELEMENT OF THE WORK OF THE OFFICE
POD1000000013_S0000077	EAN WE FEEL VERY VERY STRONGLY THAT WE ARE IN THE JUSTICE BUSINESS THAT IT IS ABOUT YOU KNOW BEING FAIR
POD1000000013_S0000078	AND NOT ONLY BEING FAIR TO COMPLAINANTS OR PEOPLE WHO FEEL THAT PUBLIC SERVICE AV SERVICES HAVE FAILED THEM BUT BEING FAIR TO TO THOSE WHO ARE WRONGLY CRITICIZED OR WRONGLY BLAMED
POD1000000013_S0000079	CAUSE I THINK AN OMBUDSMAN THE ROLE OF AN OMBUDSMAN IS ALSO TO PROVIDE VINDICATION WHEN THINGS AVE GONE RIGHT
POD1000000013_S0000080	WHAT ABOUT THE IMPACT OF SECTARIANISM ON YOUR WORK BOTH INSIDE THE OFFICE AND EXTERNALLY AS AS OMBUDSMAN
POD1000000013_S0000081	WELL WE YOU KNOW I HAVE A WORK FORCE WHO BELIEVE TOTALLY MY STAFF TOTALLY BELIEVE IN FAIRNESS AND EQUALITY
POD1000000013_S0000082	AND IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO COMPLAINS TO THE OFFICE THAT H IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO COMPLAINS OR WHAT THE NATURE OF THE COMPLAINT IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH IT
POD1000000013_S0000083	BUT I SUPPOSE WHERE THE AREA WHERE WHICH IS MOST CHALLENGING IS IN MY ROLE AS LOCAL GOVERNMENT STANDARDS COMMISSIONER WHERE I MYSELF HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF SECTARIANISM
POD1000000013_S0000084	BECAUSE YOU KNOW I WAS ADJUDICATING ON A PARTICULAR COUNSELLOR FROM A PARTICULAR PART OF THE THE UNIONIST COMMUNITY
POD1000000013_S0000085	SO THERE IS THAT ADDED LAYER OF NOT ONLY WANTING TO DO THINGS RIGHT TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION BUT BEING AWARE THAT NO MATTER WHAT THAT DECISION IS IT MIGHT PLEASE ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER
POD1000000013_S0000086	SO TO BE ACCUSED OF SECTARIANISM WAS A HUGE HURT FOR ME BECAUSE THAT'S NOT IT'S NOT PART OF MY VALUES OR MY STAFF VALUES
POD1000000013_S0000087	I MEAN THAT'S A BIG ISSUE BECAUSE IT AFFECTS YOU PERSONALLY
POD1000000013_S0000088	HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE A VERY RESILIENT TOUGH PERSON BUT EVEN THAT MUST BE HARD TO DEAL WITH
POD1000000013_S0000089	WELL FIRST OF ALL I'VE GOT HUGE SUPPORT FROM MY DEPUTY AND THE SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM WHO REASSURED ME THAT OF COURSE THIS ISN'T TRUE AND YOU KNOW IT ISN'T TRUE AND WE KNOW IT ISN'T TRUE
POD1000000013_S0000090	BUT I THINK WHAT WAS DIFFICULT WAS THE IMPACT ON MY FAMILY AND HOW THEY FELT
POD1000000013_S0000091	MY HUSBAND WAS ANGRY AND AND MY CHILDREN WERE UNHAPPY ABOUT IT
POD1000000013_S0000092	HOW DID IT AFFECT ME I LEARNED TO DEAL WITH I LEARNED THAT YOU CAN DEAL WITH THIS SORT OF CRITICISM
POD1000000013_S0000093	AND I LEARNED THAT BEHIND IT ALL YOU'VE GOT TO BE SURE THAT YOU'RE DOING YOU'RE MAKING THE RIGHT DECISION
POD1000000013_S0000094	I CAN REMEMBER A FEW WEEKS AGO WHEN I WAS SAVAGELY CRITICISED ON TWITTER
POD1000000013_S0000095	AND I WAS THIRSTING TO REPLY AND MY OLDER SON SAID TO ME LEAVE IT ALONE DAD THEY WANT YOU TO REPLY
POD1000000013_S0000096	AND I THINK THAT WAS QUITE WISE ADVICE
POD1000000013_S0000097	SO YOU DO NEED TO CONSULT WITH PEOPLE ON PERSONAL ISSUES DON'T YOU
POD1000000013_S0000098	THINK YOU DO NEED TO CONSULT
POD1000000013_S0000099	DYOU DOWHAT WHAT'S BEEN HELPFUL HAS BEEN PART OF THE OMBUDSMAN COMMUNITY'S RESPONSE TO THIS IS AND THE PERSONAL SUPPORT YOU'VE GIVEN ME ROB I WAS ABLE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT
POD1000000013_S0000100	I WAS ABLE TO TALK TO OTHERS LIKE THE CURRENT POLICE OMBUDSMAN FOR NORTHERN IRELAND WHO SAID LEAVE IT ALONE
POD1000000013_S0000101	JUST LEAVE IT BECAUSE IF YOU DO ANYTHING IF YOU TAKE ANY LEGAL ACTION THEN IT'S MERELY GOING TO PROVIDE MORE OXYGEN
POD1000000013_S0000102	
POD1000000013_S0000103	DOESN'T STOP IT BEING DIFFICULT
POD1000000013_S0000104	
POD1000000013_S0000105	ERSONALLY DIFFICULT AND THAT'S WHERE THE RESILIENCE COMES IN
POD1000000013_S0000106	THAT'S WHERE YOU'VE GOT TO GET UP THE NEXT MORNING GO INTO WORK AND YOUR STAFF HAVE GOT TO SEE THAT ALLHO MIGHT AFFECT YOU INSIDE
POD1000000013_S0000107	THAT YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO LEAD THE OFFICE AND DO THE JOB
POD1000000013_S0000108	THANK YOU THAT'S IMPORTANT
POD1000000013_S0000109	LET'S JUST MOVE THAT ON A LITTLE BIT AND TALK ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES IN RELATION TO THE ACTIONS OF PUBLIC SERVICES
POD1000000013_S0000110	YOU LAUNCHED A BRILLIANT HUMAN RIGHTS MANUAL WHICH SETS OUT AN APPROACH THAT MANY OMBUDSMEN IN EUROPE TAKE
POD1000000013_S0000111	IS NOT PARTICULARLY PREVALENT IN THE UNITED KINGDOM ABOUT ACTIONS THAT CAN BE TAKEN BY AN OMBUDSMAN
POD1000000013_S0000112	ULD YOU TELL US A BIT MORE ABOUT HOW YOU CREATED THIS
POD1000000013_S0000113	WELL IT WAS CREATED JOINTLY WITH THE NORTHERN IRELAND HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION AND IT STARTED AS EVER AS AS ALL GOOD IDEAS WITH A CONVERSATION
POD1000000013_S0000114	AND IT WAS A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION AND OUR OFFICE AROUND THE SORT OF CASE WORK THAT WE WERE DEALING WITH
POD1000000013_S0000115	WE WERE DEALING WITH ISSUES LIKE THE ROMA COMMUNITY FEELING DISCRIMINATED BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH SERVICES
POD1000000013_S0000116	WE'RE DEALING WITH ISSUES OF CONSENT PATIENTS NOT GIVING CONSENT TO INTERVENTIONS AND THE FAMILY AND THE PATIENT FEELING EXCLUDED FROM THE DECISION MAKING
POD1000000013_S0000117	BUT ALSO WE REALIZE THAT OMBUDSMEN AND HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSIONS AND OR EQUALITY BODIES ARE ACTUALLY DOING THE SAME JOB
POD1000000013_S0000118	SO WE MEAN I MY MY STYLE IS TO MOVE ON FROM THE CONVERSATION AND ACTUALLY HAVE A PRODUCT
POD1000000013_S0000119	AND THE PRODUCT WAS HOW TO DO THIS MANUAL FOR OMBUDSMAN STAFF
POD1000000013_S0000120	HOW TO INTRODUCE HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLES INTO OMBUDSMAN INVESTIGATIONS
POD1000000013_S0000121	AND IT'S QUITE SIMPLE AND IT'S NOT ABOUT STRASBURG JURISPRUDENCE
POD1000000013_S0000122	THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF IT I THINK FOR NON LAWYERS YOU KNOW FOR FOR NON LEGAL STAFF THAT THAT THEYRE THEY'RE VERY SIMPLE PRINCIPLES
POD1000000013_S0000123	ARTICIPATION A PERSON AFFECTED BY A DECISION BY WHATEVER PUBLIC SERVICE PROVIDER BE IT HEALTH BE IT HOUSING BEIT YOU KNOW LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE
POD1000000013_S0000124	THEY HAVE TO BE GIVEN ENOUGH INFORMATION TO PARTICIPATE EFFECTIVELY IN THE DECISION MAKING
POD1000000013_S0000125	SO THERE'S THE PRINCIPLE OF EMPOWERMENT GIVING INFORMATION
POD1000000013_S0000126	THERE'S THE PRINCIPLE OF NONDISCRIMINATION AND BEING TREATED TREATED EQUALLY AND FAIRLY AND HAVING EQUAL ACCESS
POD1000000013_S0000127	AND ULTIMATELY THE FOURTH PRINCIPLE OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS BASED APPROACH IS ACCOUNTABILITY AND THAT'S WHAT WE OMBUDSMEN DO
POD1000000013_S0000128	WE HOLD PUBLIC SERVICES TO ACCOUNT
POD1000000013_S0000129	AND WOULD YOU SAY THAT YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO HOLD PUBLIC SERVICES MORE TO ACCOUNT AS A RESULT OF HAVING THAT HUMAN RIGHTS BASED APPROACH
POD1000000013_S0000130	YES I THINK MALADMINISTRATION IS A TOOL
POD1000000013_S0000131	BUT I THINK THAT HAVING A HUMAN RIGHTS LENS ALLOWS YOU TO LOOK MORE CLOSELY AT AWAY SO MUCH FROM THE PROCESS AS TO HOW THE PROCESS ACTUALLY AFFECTS THE INDIVIDUALS AND AFFECTS THE INDIVIDUAL'S RIGHTS
POD1000000013_S0000132	SO TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE WE HAD A CASE WHERE A YOUNG MAN DIED AS A RESULT OF A ROUTINE EAR OPERATION
POD1000000013_S0000133	AND IT WAS A ONE IN A MILLION REACTION TO A TITANIUM INPLANT O THE PACKING AROUND TTANIUM INPLANT
POD1000000013_S0000134	E POINT BEING HIS HIS MOM AND DAD BELIEVED THAT HE WASN'T CONSENTED FOR THAT INTERVENTION
POD1000000013_S0000135	THE AND AND THAT THAT WAS UNFAIR AND AFFECTED AS HUMAN RIGHTS
POD1000000013_S0000136	THE CORONER HAD REFUSED TO UNDERTAKE AN INQUEST SAYING IT DIDN'T AFFECT HIS HUMAN RIGHTS
POD1000000013_S0000137	WHEN IT CAME TO MY OFFICE WE IDENTIFIED THE HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLE OF PARTICIPATION
POD1000000013_S0000138	IF I KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME IF I'M TOLD OF THE RISKS INSTEAD OF SOMEONE ELSE MAKING THE DECISION FOR ME THEN MY HUMAN RIGHTS HAVE BEEN RESPECTED
POD1000000013_S0000139	WHEN I DREW THAT OUT IN THE INVESTIGATION REPORT I WAS ABLE TO COME TO A CONCLUSION THAT WHERE THERE WAS THERE WAS A CONFLICT BETWEEN THE EXPERTS
POD1000000013_S0000140	SOME SAID WELL ANOTHER CONSULTANT MIGHT NOT HAVE DONE THE IMPLANT ANOTHER SAID THEY WOULD HAVE THEY WOULD HAVE THEY WOULD HAVE GONE AHEAD WITH THE IMPLANT
POD1000000013_S0000141	BUT ACTUALLY THE HUMAN RIGHTS BASED APPROACH MEANT THAT I THOUGHT ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL NDTHAT THEY HADN'T BEEN PROPERLY CONSENTED
POD1000000013_S0000142	THE RESULT NOT ONLY DID THE FAMILY GET AN INVESTIGATION REPORT IDENTIFYING THIS ISSUE BUT THEY WERE ABLE TO GO TO THE CORONER
POD1000000013_S0000143	HE'S COMMENCED AN INQUEST
POD1000000013_S0000144	NOW YOU HAVE TWO THINGS IN NORTHERN IRELAND THAT WE DON'T HAVE YOU HAVE A
POD1000000013_S0000145	PARTLY BECAUSE OF YOUR OWN EXCELLENCE IN BRINGING IT ABOUT YOU HAVE AN INTEGRATED PUBLIC SERVICE OMBUDSMAN SCHEME AND YOU HAVE THE POWER OF OWN INITIATIVE
POD1000000013_S0000146	ARE THESE VALUABLE ADDITIONS TO THE WAY OMBUDSMEN SHOULD BE WORKING
POD1000000013_S0000147	I DO BELIEVE IN THE ONE STOP SHOP MODEL
POD1000000013_S0000148	THE PUBLIC SERVICES OMBUDSMAN IN NORTHERN IRELAND LOOKS AT COMPLAINTS ABOUT GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS STATUTAORY AGENCIES LOCAL GOVERNMENT HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE EDUCATION SCHOOLS UNIVERSITIES COLLEGES
POD1000000013_S0000149	I THINK THAT CAN BE CHALLENGING FOR STAFF BUT I BELIEVE THAT THEY ENJOY THE VARIETY
POD1000000013_S0000150	BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT AN OMBUDSMAN OMBUDSMAN PRINCIPLES OF GOOD ADMINISTRATION APPLY ACROSS SECTORS
POD1000000013_S0000151	SO YES I THINK IT IS OF VALUE
POD1000000013_S0000152	I THINK HAVING ONE PLACE TO GO TO TO SEEK REDRESS FOR INJUSTICE IS IS IMPORTANT
POD1000000013_S0000153	IF PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO GO TO COURT THERE'S AN OMBUDSMAN THERE THAT CAN LOOK AT THE FULL RANGE
POD1000000013_S0000154	OWN INITIATIVE IS FOR ME AN ESSENTIAL TOOL OF EVERY OMBUDSMAN'S TOOLKIT
POD1000000013_S0000155	WHEN YOU LOOK INTERNATIONALLY
POD1000000013_S0000156	YOU LOOK AT OMBUDSMEN IN AUSTRALIA YOU LOOK AT OMBUDSMEN IN EUROPE YOU LOOK AT OMBUDSMAN IN NORTH AMERICA THE ONTARIO OMBUDSMAN THE WEST WESTERN AUSTRALIAN MBUDSMAN
POD1000000013_S0000157	THEYALL HAVE OWNE INITIATIVE THEY'VE ALL HAD OWN INITIATIVE FROM THE START
POD1000000013_S0000158	THE IRISH OMBUDSMAN ACT THAT WAS CREATED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY HAD OWN INITIATIVE THERE AS WELL AS DEALING WITH INDIVIDUAL COMPLAINTS
POD1000000013_S0000159	FOR ME AN OMBUDSMAN WITHOUT OWN INITIATIVE CAN'T FULFILL THA TH THE MANDATE OF IMPROVING PUBLIC SERVICES FOR MANY NOT JUST FR THE INDIVIDUAL
POD1000000013_S0000160	SO YOU WOULD UYOU'D HAVE NO HESITATION ABOUT INTRODUCING AN INITIATIVE IT'S ESSENI
POD1000000013_S0000161	NOT AT ALL I WAS LUCKY TO BE PART OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE OMBUDSMAN ACT
POD1000000013_S0000162	AND WAS KEY TO HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO PERSSUADE OFFICIALS WHO WERE PERHAPS NERVOUS ABOUT THE NOMBUDSMAN HAVING OWN INITIATIVE POWERS
POD1000000013_S0000163	THAT REALLY THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY COULD BENEFIT PUBLIC SERVICES IN THE END
POD1000000013_S0000164	SE IT IS ABOUT PREVENTION
POD1000000013_S0000165	YOU CAN DEAL WITH NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS BUT NEVER GET TO THE CORE ISSUE WHEREAS OWN INITIATIVE ALLOWS YOU TO TACKLE THE CORE ISSUE OF SYSTEMIC FAILING
POD1000000013_S0000166	WELL I AGREE WITH THAT
POD1000000013_S0000167	AND THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S NECESSARY FOR US TO HAVE THE REFORM THAT YOU'VE ALREADY BEEN OPERATING FOR NEARLY THREE YEARS
POD1000000013_S0000168	YES AND NOW THE WELSH OMBUDSMAN IS ABOUT TO GET THAT ALSO
POD1000000013_S0000169	I BELIEVE SCOTTISH OMBUDSMEN WOULD LIKE OWN INITIATIVE
POD1000000013_S0000170	SO IF THAT HAPPENS IT MEANS THAT THE DEVOLVED ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE IT
POD1000000013_S0000171	AND THE FIRST EVER OMBUDSMAN IN THESE ISLANDS THE PARLIAMENTARY OMBUDSMAN HAS NOT
POD1000000013_S0000172	AND I THINK THAT'S MISSING AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO IMPROVE PUBLIC SERVICES FOR THE CITIZEN
POD1000000013_S0000173	AS YOU MOVE ON FROM THE PUBLIC SERVICE OMBUDSMAN WHAT WHAT ARE YOU MOST PROUD OF
POD1000000013_S0000174	IS IT BRINGING THE WHOLE THING TOGETHER THE INTEGRATION OF THE VARIOUS SYSTEMS
POD1000000013_S0000175	I THINK THE LEGISLATION THAT ALLOWED THE PUBLIC SERVICES OMBUDSMAN AS A ONE STOP SHOP FOR COMPLAINTS ABOUT PUBLIC SERVICES
POD1000000013_S0000176	BUT ALSO BEING ABLE TO BRING IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT STANDARDS
POD1000000013_S0000177	BECAUSE NORTHERN IRELAND WAS ONE OF WHAT WAS THE ONLY PART IN EUROPE DIDN'T HAVE A MANDATORY CODE OF CONDUCT FOR LOCAL REPRESENTATIVES
POD1000000013_S0000178	THAT WAS INTRODUCED IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN
POD1000000013_S0000179	AND MY OFFICE AND MYSELF AND AND I AS DEPUTY OMBUDSMAN NOW OMBUDSMAN HAVE BEEN KEY TO ESTABLISHING AN INVESTIGATIVE AND JUDICATIVE FUNCTION IN NORTHERN IRELAND
POD1000000013_S0000180	THAT THAT IS A UNIQUE MODEL BUT I BELIEVE OPERATES VERY WELL
POD1000000013_S0000181	THAT IS NOT WORK THAT IS OUT WITH OMBUDSMANRY
POD1000000013_S0000182	BECAUSE FOR ME ETHICAL STANDARDS VALUES FAIRNESS THEY'RE ALL PART OF GOOD GOVERNANCE AND THAT THAT'S WHERE WE OMBUDSMEN ARE
POD1000000013_S0000183	IMEAN WE'RE NOT A COURT WE DON'T DECLARE WDON'T MAKE BINDING DECISIONS
POD1000000013_S0000184	BUT NEVERTHELESS WE CAN INFLUENCE WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MAKE AND WITH SETTING STANDARDS
POD1000000013_S0000186	WE ASKED COLLEAGUES ON TWITTER TO SEND IN QUESTIONS
POD1000000013_S0000187	AND WE HAD A SET OF QUESTIONS FROM ONE DISSATISFIED USER OF THE SERVICE UNDER YOUR PREDECESSOR WHO FELT THAT SHE HADN'T BEEN TREATED FAIRLY BY THE SYSTEM
POD1000000013_S0000188	WHAT CAN YOU SAY TO PEOPLE IN THAT POSITION
POD1000000013_S0000189	THINK THAT MANY PEOPLE MISUNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF THE OMBUDSMAN
POD1000000013_S0000190	THEY BELIEVE THAT THE OMBUDSMAN IS THERE PARTICULARLY TO ADVOCATE FOR THEM AND THEIR PARTICULAR ISSUE
POD1000000013_S0000191	OMBUDSMEN ARE IMPARTIAL SO IF THEY'RE THE A FINDING OF NO FAILURE CAN BE DISAPPOINTING TO A COMPLAINANT
POD1000000013_S0000192	AND I BELIEVE THAT WAS THE CASE IN RELATION TO THE PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL THAT YOU REFERRED T
POD1000000013_S0000193	THE PREVIOUS OMBUDSMAN DID NOT FIND IN HER FAVOR AND THAT CAN BE DISAPPOINTING
POD1000000013_S0000194	BUT THEN YOU'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT IS THAT PERHAPS A CLINICIAN OR A MEMBER OF HEALTH STAFF WHO HAS BEEN CRITICIZED RECEIVES YOU KNOW A MESSAGE THAT ACTUALLY THEY DID IT RIGHT
POD1000000013_S0000195	BUT THERE ARE MANY OCCASIONS IN WHICH COMPLAINANTS DON'T AGREE WITH MY DECISIONS
POD1000000013_S0000197	BUT I STILL HAVE TO DECIDE FAIRLY ENSURE THERE'S A FAIR PROCESS ENSURE EVERYONE GETS AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT AND AND AND REPORT ON THE MATTER
POD1000000013_S0000198	T'S THAT'S WHAT AN OMBUDSMAN DOES
POD1000000013_S0000199	YEAH IT'S DIFFICULT SOMETIMES TO EXPLAIN THAT WHILE THE COMPLAINT BELONGS TO THE COMPLAINANT THE DECISION BELONGS TO THE OMBUDSMAN PROVIDING IT'S EVIDENCE BASED AND ANDRIGOROUS
POD1000000013_S0000200	PROVIDED IT'S EVIDENCE EVIDENCE BASED AND RIGOROUS BUT ALSO I BELIEVE FAIR
POD1000000013_S0000201	YOU HAVE TO GIVE EVERYONE AN OPPORTUNITY INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE CRITICIZED
POD1000000013_S0000202	BUT THIS ISSUE ABOUT IT'S AN OMBUDSMAN DECISION WHENE YOU BRING YOUR COMPLAINT
POD1000000013_S0000203	IT IS THE OMBUDSMAN'S DECISION HAS ACTUALLY BEEN WRITTEN INTO THE LEGISLATION THAT I REFER TO
POD1000000013_S0000204	WHICH IS THAT UNDER THE NORTHERN IRISH OMBUDSMAN LEGISLATION THE TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN ACT THAT I MENTIONED THAT EVEN IF A COMPLAINANT WITHDREW THEIR COMPLAINT I CAN STILL INVESTIGATE
POD1000000013_S0000205	SO IT IS THE OMBUDSMAN'S INVESTIGATION
POD1000000013_S0000206	NOW YOU YOU'VE E BEEN WITH THE OFFICE IN NORTHEN IRLAND FOR TEN YEARS
POD1000000013_S0000207	'S A LONG TIME WILL YOU HAVE ANY REGRETS ABOUT
POD1000000013_S0000208	MOVING ON EVEN THOUGH IT'S TO AN EVEN MORE DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING ROLE
POD1000000013_S0000209	I HAVE HUGE I HAVE HUGE REGRETS ABOUT LEAVING MY STAFF BECAUSE THEY ARE THEY ARE WONDERFUL TO WORK WITH HUGELY SUPPORTIVE
POD1000000013_S0000210	AND ON DAYS WHEN I DON'T HAVE MY USUAL LEVEL OF ENERGY THEY GIVE ME THE ENERGY BACK TO KEEP GOING
POD1000000013_S0000211	SO I HVE REGRETS ABOUT LEAVING MY STAFF
POD1000000013_S0000212	UTI MEAN I WAS ASKED THIS QUESTION ABOUT WHY DO YOU WANT TO UNDERTAKE THE ROLE OF POLICE OMBUDSMAN
POD1000000013_S0000213	I DO BELIEVE THAT I IT'S ABOUT PUBLIC SERVICE AND IT'S ABOUT BRINGING MY EXPERIENCE
POD1000000013_S0000214	USAID TEN YEARS EXPERIENCE IN THE OMBUDSMAN'S OFFICE FIVE YEARS EXPERIENCE IN THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE
POD1000000013_S0000215	IT'S BRINGING BRINGING THAT TO BEAR IN WHAT IS YOU KNOW A VERY CHALLENGING AREA DEALING WITH POLICE COMPLAINTS IN NORTHERN IRELAND
POD1000000013_S0000216	NOW YOU'VE SPENT THE DAY WITH US SPEAKING TO MY COLLEAGUES AT OUR ALL STAFF AWAY DAY
POD1000000013_S0000217	WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE TO OUR YOUNGER COLLEAGUES MANY OF WHOM HAVE ONLY RECENTLY JOINED THE OMBOUDS PROFESSION
POD1000000013_S0000218	THE ADVICE I WOULD GIVE IS FIRST OF ALL IT IS A PROFESSION
POD1000000013_S0000219	AS YOU KNOW ROB NDFROM YOUR DISCUSSIONS WITH ME I BELIEVE VERY MUCH THAT THT THAT IT HAS TO BE RECOGNIZED AS A PROFESSION

POD1000000015_S0000032	BUT I THINK THE MBA BECAUSE I WENT BACK TO THAT AFTER I'D BEEN WORKING A WHILE WAS PROBABLY THE MOST ENLIGHTENING PART OF MY EDUCATION
POD1000000015_S0000033	BECAUSE AGAIN I LEARNED A LOT ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS BUT WHAT IT IT GAVE ME BECAUSE I HAD THE WAS ABLE TO REFLECT ON A WORKING BACKGROUND AS WELL
POD1000000015_S0000034	WHAT IT GAVE ME WAS A SENSE OF HOW TO ASK QUESTIONS AND CHALLENGE IN A WAY PERHAPS I HADN'T DONE BEFORE THAT
POD1000000015_S0000035	VERY FAMOUS ALUMNI FROM THAT MBA I THINK VINCENT COMPANY IS A GRADUATE OF THAT SCHEME DID YOU KNOW HIM
POD1000000015_S0000036	NO I DIDN'T IN FACT I I DON'T THINK THAT ANY OF MY COHORTS ARE NAMES THAT HAVE COME UP TO PROMINENCE
POD1000000015_S0000037	BUT HAVE ALL GONE ON TO DO GOOD THINGS SOME VERY INTERESTING THINGS
POD1000000015_S0000038	I FOR MYSELF BECAUSE I WAS I WAS PUBLIC SECTOR AT THE TIME AND I'VE REMAINED PUBLIC SECTOR FOR MOST OF THE TIME SINCE THEN PERHAPS AVE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT VIEW OF IT
POD1000000015_S0000039	BECAUSE I WAS VERY DELIBERATE IN NOT ALWAYS GOING DOWN PUBLIC SECTOR ROUTES FOR STUDY OR PUBLIC SECTOR MODULES BECAUSE I WANTED TO LEARN MORE ABOUT DIFFERENT SORTS OF THINKING
POD1000000015_S0000040	WHEN DID YOU DECIDE WHAT SORT OF CAREER YOU WANTED
POD1000000015_S0000041	I'M YET TO MEET AN OMBUDSMAN WHO DECIDED THEY WANTED TO BE AN OMBUDSMAN
POD1000000015_S0000042	
POD1000000015_S0000043	I
POD1000000015_S0000044	CAN OWN UP TO THAT
POD1000000015_S0000045	IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT
POD1000000015_S0000046	I WENT TO WORK I WAS WORKING IN CHINA LECTURING IN BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS AND I NEEDED A JOB WHEN I GOT BACK
POD1000000015_S0000047	SO I THOUGHT OH THEY'RE ADVERTISING FOR INVESTIGATORS AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT OMBUDSMAN THAT'LL DO FOR A WHILE IT'LL PAY THE MORTGAGE UNTIL I GET SOMETHING ELSE
POD1000000015_S0000048	AND I'VE PRETTY MUCH NEVER LEFT OMBUDSMANING OR INFORMATION COMMISSIONING SINCE
POD1000000015_S0000049	AND I THINK WHAT IT WAS WAS I FOUND A JOB THAT I ENJOYED IT WAS CHALLENGING BUT ACTUALLY FITTED IN WITH MY VALUE SYSTEM
POD1000000015_S0000050	RIGHT AND YOU'VE HAD A VERY DISTINGUISHED AND VARIED CAREER YOU WERE THE SCOTTISH INFORMATION COM
POD1000000015_S0000051	WHAT WHAT WAS THE HIGHLIGHT OF THAT BEFORE YOU CAME TO THE SCOTTISH PUBLIC SERVICE OMBUDSMAN
POD1000000015_S0000052	I THINK IT'S HARD TO SAY WHAT HIGHLIGHT IS IN TERMS OF BEING THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER
POD1000000015_S0000053	HERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT I DID THAT I WAS REALLY PROUD OF IN A GOOD WAY
POD1000000015_S0000054	ONE OF THEM WAS IT SOUNDS VERY TRIVIAL BUT WE ESTABLISHED A PORTAL FOR THE UPLOADING OF FREEDOM OF INFORMATION STATISTICS FROM PUBLIC BODIES IN SCOTLAND
POD1000000015_S0000055	AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS NOW THERE IS A THREE OR FOUR YEAR DATABASE OF THE NUMBER OF FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUESTS AND THE OUTCOME OF THEM FOR THE WHOLE OF SCOTLAND
POD1000000015_S0000056	THAT WE CAN LOOK AT TRENDS WE CAN LOOK AT DEVELOPMENTS
POD1000000015_S0000057	AND THAT ACTUALLY FOR ME WAS A HIGHLIGHT BECAUSE I DIDN'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE ENFORCEMENT POWER TO DO IT
POD1000000015_S0000058	IT WAS DONE THROUGH COOPERATION AND CO WORKING WITH PUBLIC BODIES
POD1000000015_S0000059	THE OTHER COUPLE OF THINGS THAT REALLY STUCK IN MY MIND WAS VERY VERY EARLY ON A PARTICULAR DECISION I MADE
POD1000000015_S0000060	WHICH WAS ENFORCING R TELLING THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT THEY HAD TO DISCLOSE WHETHER THEY HAD TAKEN LEGAL ADVICE ABOUT SCOTLAND'S POSITION WITH EUROPE
POD1000000015_S0000061	SHOULD THEY GAIN INDEPENDENCE BECAUSE IT WAS THE TIME OF THE INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM
POD1000000015_S0000062	
POD1000000015_S0000063	AND WHY THAT'S PARTICULARLY INTERESTING IS IT WAS A VERY BIG ISSUE I THINK IN THE INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM AND NOBODY I THINK COULD HAVE FORESEEN WHERE WE ARE NOW
POD1000000015_S0000064	THE FINAL ONE WHICH I THINK I'LL TALK ABOUT MORE WHEN WE TALK MAYBE ABOUT SOME OF THE OMBUDSMAN POWERS
POD1000000015_S0000065	WAS ABOUT A DIFFERENT WAY OF INTERVENING IN RELATION TO GOOD AND POOR PRACTICE WITH SCOTTISH PUBLIC BODIES
POD1000000015_S0000066	YOURE YOUR ENGLISH I THINK IS THAT CORRECT
POD1000000015_S0000067	E
POD1000000015_S0000068	SO HAS THERE EVER BEEN AN ISSUE ABOUT YOU HOLDING PRESTIGIOUS AND IMPORTANT JOBS IN SCOTLAND
POD1000000015_S0000069	ABOUT AN ENGLISH PERSON HAVING THAT RESPONSIBILITY
POD1000000015_S0000070	NO I HAVE A SCOTTISH NAME AGNEW IS A SCOTTISH NAME AND I AM MARRIED TO SOMEBODY FROM SCOTTISH DISCENT
POD1000000015_S0000071	I WAS ONCE ASKED BY A JOURNALIST WAS I HAPPY THAT I HAD ADOPTED SCOTLAND AS MY HOME
POD1000000015_S0000072	AND I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THE ANSWER REFLECTED HOW I FELT WHICH WAS I'M ETERNALLY GRATEFUL THAT SCOTLAND HAS ADOPTED ME AS A SOMEBODY WHO LIVES THERE AND DOES THESE THINGS WITHIN SCOTLAND
POD1000000015_S0000073	BUT NO IT'S IT'S A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE TO BEING IN ENGLAND BUT I'VE NEVER NOT TO MY FACE ANYWAY EVER HAD AN ISSUE WITH BEING ENGLISH
POD1000000015_S0000074	THAT'S GOOD TO HAR
POD1000000015_S0000075	NOW CAN WE JUST TALK A BIT ABOUT THE SCOTTISH OMBUDSMAN WHICH YOU TOOK UP POST NEARLY THREE YEARS AGO
POD1000000015_S0000076	THE DEVOLVED OMBUDSMAN ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE U K OMBUDSMAN
POD1000000015_S0000077	BECAUSE THEY'RE MORE MODERN THEY'VE ADOPTED LEGISLATION TO MAKE THEM MORE RELEVANT TO DEVELOPING SITUATIONS AND YOU HAVE MORE POWERS THAN THE UK OMBUDSMAN HAS
POD1000000015_S0000078	WHAT'S IT LIKE BEING THE HEAD OF AN INTEGRATED PUBLIC SERVICE OMBUDSMAN IS THAT A GOOD THING
POD1000000015_S0000079	YES I THINK IT'S A VERY GOOD THING BECAUSE YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT SORT OF INSIGHT YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT SORT OF OVERVIEW AND SECTORS DO VARY
POD1000000015_S0000080	THE THERE IS VARIANCE BECAUSE THEY'RE WORKING TO DIFFERENT REGULATIONS IT IT MAKES YOUR JOB VERY VARIED ALSO
POD1000000015_S0000081	I THINK ONE OF HE THE CHALLENGES WITH IT THOUGH IS IF YOU WORK IN A SPECIFIC SECTOR
POD1000000015_S0000082	SO IF I REFLECT ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT OMBUDSMAN YOU BECAME MUCH MORE IMMERSED IN THE TECHNICALITIES OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT
POD1000000015_S0000083	WHEN YOU WORK ACROSS SECTORS WHAT WE FIND IS PARTICULARLY A PERSONAL REFLECTION IS I HAVE TO DO A BIT MORE DIGGING ROUND TO FIND OUT ABOUT HOW TETHE SECTORS OPERATE IN SCOTLAND
POD1000000015_S0000084	AND I ALSO RELY QUITE A LOT ON PROFESSIONAL ADVICE PARTICULARLY FOR HEALTH AND SOCIAL WORK
POD1000000015_S0000085	SO WE DON'T NECESSARILY DEVELOP THROUGH EXPERIENCE OF VOLUME OF CASES THE SAME EXPERIENCE THAT YOU DO WHEN YOU'RE PERHAPS LOOKING AT
POD1000000015_S0000086	ONE PARTICULAR AREA OF PUBLIC SERVICE
POD1000000015_S0000087	BUT THE OTHER THING THAT I THINK REFLECTS WITH MYSELF AND THE WELSH AND THE NORTHERN IRELAND OMBUDSMAN IS BECAUSE THE POPULATION OF THE COUNTRY IS SMALLER
POD1000000015_S0000088	AND THE COUNTRY ITSELF HAS A DIFFERENT SORT OF STRUCTURE TO IT
POD1000000015_S0000089	YOU OFTEN GET GIVEN THINGS TO DO THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT AN OMBUDSMAN TO BE DOING
POD1000000015_S0000090	SO AS WELL AS COMPLAINT HANDLING AND H THE COMPLAINT STANDARDS WE ALSO HAVE DUTIES FOR WITH THE FINAL STAGE OF APPEAL FOR A BENEFIT SCOTTISH WELFARE FUND
POD1000000015_S0000091	AND THEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT NORTHERN IRELAND AND WALES THEY ALSO HAVE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE DIFFERENT
POD1000000015_S0000092	AND I THINK THAT IS AS MUCH A CHALLENGE AS ANYTHING BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST LIKE RUNNING TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS BUT TRYING TO HAVE AN INTEGRATED ORGANISATION
POD1000000015_S0000093	OKY SYOU RELY ON PROFESSIONAL ADVICE BUT THERE MUST ALSO BE A CHALLENGE FOR YOUR CASE HANDLERS TO DEAL WITH THE THE WIDTH OF FUNCTIONS THAT THEY COME UP
POD1000000015_S0000094	AE YOU DIVIDED ACCORDING TO THE SECTORS OR DO PEOPLE
POD1000000015_S0000096	MULTITASKING TO DO
POD1000000015_S0000097	THEY HAVE MULTITASKING TO DO AND THEY ARE AN INCREDIBLE SET OF PEOPLE MY INVESTIGATORS
POD1000000015_S0000098	BUT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DRIVES US AND THAT IS PROBABLY THE THE UNITING THING IS VERY MUCH ABOUT VALUES
POD1000000015_S0000099	AND I THINK LIKE MOST OMBUDSMAN ORGANIZATIONS I'VE EVER COME ACROSS IT'S A FAIRLY UNIQUE WORKFORCE I WOULD SAY
POD1000000015_S0000100	BECAUSE YOU ASK ANYBODY WHY WE'RE THERE AND VERY RARELY WILL YOU DEVIATE FAR FROM BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE BECAUSE WE WANT TO SEE IMPROVEMENT BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE THINGS BETTER
POD1000000015_S0000101	SO YES IT'S A CHALLENGE HAVING THE SCOPE AND WE HAVE SOME INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY HAVE A BACKGROUND IN A PARTICULAR AREA BUT WE DON'T HAVE SPECIALISTS
POD1000000015_S0000102	OKAY NOW WHAT YOU HAVE WHICH WE DON'T HAVE IS THE STATUS OF BEING A COMPLAINT STANDARDS AUTHORITY
POD1000000015_S0000103	COULD YOU EXPLAIN TO OUR LISTENERS BRIEFLY WHAT THAT MEANS
POD1000000015_S0000104	BRIEFLY WHAT IT MEANS IS THE OMBUDSMAN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SETTING A MODEL COMPLAINTS HANDLING PROCESS THAT ALL SCOTTISH BODIES MUST FOLLOW
POD1000000015_S0000105	AND WE THEN WITH THAT HAVE A DUTY TO MONITOR PERFORMANCE IN RELATION TO COMPLAINT HANDLING AND COMBINED WITH SOME OF OUR OTHER POWERS DUTY TO ENFORCE GOOD PRACTICE TO REPORT ON IT
POD1000000015_S0000106	NOW THAT SOUNDS YOU KNOW OH THAT'S NICE MODEL COMPLAINTS HANDLING
POD1000000015_S0000107	BUT WHAT IT MEANS IN PRACTICE IS WITH SOME SLIGHT VARIATIONS BY SECTOR BECAUSE DIFFERENT SECTORS HAVE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT NEEDS
POD1000000015_S0000108	IT MEANS THAT ANYBODY MAKING A COMPLAINT TO A PUBLIC BODY IN SCOTLAND AND ABOUT A PUBLIC BODY IN SCOTLAND IS BASICALLY MAKING A COMPLAINT UNDER THE SAME SET OF STANDARDS
POD1000000015_S0000109	SO THE MODEL COMPLAINTS HANDLING PROCESS SAYS THAT THE FIRST STAGE OF A COMPLAINT YOU MUST TRY AND RESPOND WITHIN FIVE WORKING DAYS TO RESOLVE IT
POD1000000015_S0000110	VERY BIG FOCUS ON RESOLUTION
POD1000000015_S0000111	IF YOU CAN'T OR THE PERSON IS NOT SATISFIED YOU CAN THEN TAKE ANOTHER TWENTY WORKING DAYS TO LOOK AT IT IN MORE DETAIL
POD1000000015_S0000112	IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU THINK YOU NEED MORE THAN TWENTY DAYS FOR THEN TALK TO THE COMPLAINER ABOUT THAT
POD1000000015_S0000113	BUT IT ESSENTIALLY MEANS THAT IF SOMEBODY DOES NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE OR DOESN'T RECEIVE A RESPONSE IN TIME THEY GET TO THE OMBUDSMAN A LOT QUICKER THAN THEY MIGHT OTHERWISE DO
POD1000000015_S0000114	THE OTHER BENEFIT OF THE COMPLAINTS MODEL COMPLAINTS HANDLING PROCESS IS THAT THERE IS A VERY STRONG FOCUS ON LEARNING FROM COMPLAINTS
POD1000000015_S0000115	SO THE STANDARDS THAT GO WITH THIS WHICH INCIDENTALY I HAVE TO LAY BEFORE THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT THE STANDARDS
POD1000000015_S0000116	THEY ALSO HAVE A VERY STRONG BENT ON LEARNING FROM COMPLAINTS
POD1000000015_S0000117	AND I THINK THAT'S AN AREA WHERE WE CAN PERHAPS DEVELOP MORE IN HOW WE HOLD PUBLIC BODIES TO ACCOUNT TO DEMONSTRATE THAT LEARNING
POD1000000015_S0000118	BECAUSE LIKE OUR COMPLAINTS THE MODEL COMPLAINTS HANDLING WE HAVE TO SHOW THAT THERE IS AN IMPACT AND THAT THERE IS VALUE TO INDIVIDUALS AND TO PUBLIC SERVICES AS A WHOLE
POD1000000015_S0000119	I THINK FOR ME THE THE MOST VALUABLE THING ABOUT IT THOUGH IS IT GIVES YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH PUBLIC BODIES NOT ALWAYS IN OPPOSITION TO THEM
POD1000000015_S0000120	WHICH WITH THE BEST WILL IN THE WORLD HOWEVER MUCH YOU TRY A RESOLUTION OR A SORT OF DISCURSIVE WAY OF LOOKING AT COMPLAINTS
POD1000000015_S0000121	ONCE A COMPLAINT HAS REACHED THE OMBUDSMAN IT IS IN MANY WAYS ADVERSARIAL WHETHER YOU WANT IT TO BE OR NOT
POD1000000015_S0000122	BUT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT COMPLAINT HANDLING AS A WHOLE YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY ACTUALLY TO HELP PUBLIC BODIES
POD1000000015_S0000123	AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO GET BETTER AT COMPLAINT HANDLING WHICH YOU HOPE MEANS THEY GET BETTER AT LEARNING FROM COMPLAINTS
POD1000000015_S0000124	WHICH MEANS PEOPLE GET THE RIGHT SERVICE THE FIRST TIME
POD1000000015_S0000125	DON'T THINK WE'LL EVER ELIMINATE COMPLAINTS BUT CERTAINLY IT HOPEFULLY WILL MAKE IT A MORE PRODUCTIVE EXPERIENCE
POD1000000015_S0000126	NOW I'M A FULL SUPPORTER OF WHAT YOU'RE DOI
POD1000000015_S0000127	I'M A BURGLAR OF YOUR PRACTICE WHEN I WAS THE HIGHER EDUCATION OMBUDSMAN I STOLE IT HOOKLINE AND SINKER TO USE IN ENGLISH UNIVERSITIES
POD1000000015_S0000128	THE IDEA THAT THEY COULD RESOLVE COMPLAINTS WITHIN FIVE DAYS WAS ANATHAMA TO THEM THEY WOULDN'T THEY WOULDN'T HAVE THAT WE ENDED UP WITH NINETY
POD1000000015_S0000129	BUTNEVERTHELESS THEY THEY DID IT
POD1000000015_S0000130	BUT THE DIFFERENCE AND THE THE RADICAL NATURE OF WHAT YOU DO IS EFFECTIVELY YOU ARE A REGULATOR NOW
POD1000000015_S0000131	WHEREAS OMBUDSMEN HAVE TRADITIONALLY ALWAYS SAID WE RELY ON OUR MORAL AUTHORITY NOT ON A COERCIVE POWER
POD1000000015_S0000132	HAS THAT MADE A DIFFERENCE OR IS IT JUST WORDS
POD1000000015_S0000133	NO I DON'T THINK IT MAKES IT'S MADE A DIFFERENCE YET
POD1000000015_S0000134	I ALSO THINK I SHOULD ADD THAT I WAS AN OMBUDSMAN WHEN THE COMPLAINT STANDARD AUTHORITY CAME IN
POD1000000015_S0000135	
POD1000000015_S0000136	AND CREDIT HAS TO GO TO JIM MARTIN MY PREDECESSOR FOR DRIVING THIS
POD1000000015_S0000137	
POD1000000015_S0000138	WHAT HE'S LEFT ME AS A LEGACY IS SOMETHING REALLY GOOD TO DEVELOP AND WORK WITH WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW
POD1000000015_S0000139	HAVING BEEN INFORMATION COMMISSIONER WHICH REALLY IS A REGULATORY FUNCTION O OWYOUR DECISION IS BINDING OR YOU GO TO COURT
POD1000000015_S0000140	I THINK THE CONCEPT OF REGULATION PROBABLY HASN'T CREPT INTO OUR THINKING WITH COMPLAINT STANDARDS IN QUITE THE SAME WAY
POD1000000015_S0000141	BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DEVELOPING BUT MAYBE NOT CALLING IT REGULATION IN THE SAME WAY
POD1000000015_S0000142	BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WOULD SAY LEARNING FROM HINDSIGHT IS THAT WE TOOK A VERY STRUCTURED APPROACH OF ROLLING IT OUT SECTOR BY SECTOR THIS MODEL COMPLAINTS HANDLING
POD1000000015_S0000143	AND WHAT THAT MEANT WAS IT WAS A NUMBER OF YEARS BEFORE EVERY PUBLIC BODY IN SCOTLAND WAS FOLLOWING HIS
POD1000000015_S0000144	O THE NHS WAS THE LAST AND THAT'S BEEN THE LAST I THINK JUST COMING UP TO THE END OF THEIR SECOND YEAR
POD1000000015_S0000145	NOW IF YOU COMPARE THAT TO THE FIRST WHICH WAS LOCAL GOVERNMENT
POD1000000015_S0000146	LOCAL GOVERNMENT NOW S A REALLY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF COMPLAINTS GET RESPONDED TO IN THE FIRST INSTANCE IN THE FIVE WORKING DAYS
POD1000000015_S0000147	I THINK FROM MEMORY IT'S IT'S OVER EIGHTY PERCENT AND THAT'S REALLY SIGNIFICANT FOR COMPLAINERS
POD1000000015_S0000148	NOW WHAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS AND WE WENT LIVE WITH IN APRIL IS WHAT WE'VE CALLED OUR SUPPORT AND INTERVENTION POLICY
POD1000000015_S0000149	AND THIS IS A CONCEPT THAT I BROUGHT WITH ME FROM BEING INFORMATION COMMISSIONER
POD1000000015_S0000150	AND BASICALLY WAS LOOKING AT ALL THE POWERS THAT YOU HAVE AS AN OMBUDSMAN BECAUSE THE REAL VALUE COMES IN THE COMBINATION OF THEM NOT JUST THE INDIVIDUAL BITS
POD1000000015_S0000151	SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE POWERS TO SET COMPLAINT HANDLING PROCESSES TO TAKE ACTION IF COMPLAINT HANDLING FALLS SHORT YOU THEN LOOK AT OTHER THINGS LIKE YOUR INFORMATION GATHERING POWERS
POD1000000015_S0000152	WE'VE CREATED A FRAMEWORK WHICH SETS OUT WHAT OUR POWERS ARE AND WITHIN THAT WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO TO EITHER SUPPORT OR IF NECESSARY INTERVENE
POD1000000015_S0000153	BECAUSE WHEN WE FOR EXAMPLE A SIMPLE EXAMPLE WE MIGHT SEE A NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS FROM A PUBLIC BODY WHERE THE FINAL RESPONSE THAT THEY GIVE TO THE COMPLAINEN DOES NOT SIGNPOST THE OMBUDSMAN
POD1000000015_S0000154	THEY HAVE A DUTY TO DO THAT UNDER THE COMPLAINTS HANDLING PROCESS
POD1000000015_S0000155	SO WE ARE GETTING BETTER AT OUR OWN INTELLIGENCE WE 'RE LOGGING FEEDBACK RECOMMENDATIONS OBSERVATIONS FROM WHAT WE SEE IN COMPLAINTS
POD1000000015_S0000156	SO IF WE SPOT SOMETHING LIKE THAT WE MIGHT JUST WELL MY MY INVESTIGATORS MY COMPLAINTS REVIEWERS WILL LET THE PUBLIC BODY KNOW
POD1000000015_S0000157	WE GIVE FEEDBACK IN DECISIONS
POD1000000015_S0000158	IF WE KEEP SEEING THAT WE MIGHT GIVE IT MORE FORMAL AND SAY WE'VE SPOTTED THIS A NUMBER OF TIMES
POD1000000015_S0000159	BUT IS THERE ANY HELP YOU KOW WE MIGHT OFFER TO SAY SHARE A TEMPLATE LETTER
POD1000000015_S0000160	OR IF IT'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT PERHAPS GO AND GIVE THEM SOME TRAINING IF WE'VE GOT THE RESOURCE TO DO THAT
POD1000000015_S0000161	BUT WE SET IT OUT STEP BY STEP AT WHICH POINT IT BECOMES A MANAGEMENT ISSUE AND SENIOR MANAGERS MIGHT ACTUALLY CONTACT SENIOR MANAGERS OR CHIEF EXECUTIVES
POD1000000015_S0000162	THE ULTIMATE BEING WE USE THE POWERS THAT THE OMBUDSMAN HAS TO ENFORCE AND REPORT
POD1000000015_S0000164	VERY INCREMENTAL UND CIVILIZED BUT DO YOU DO YOU COME ACROSS INTRANSIGENTCE
POD1000000015_S0000165	WELL IT WENT LIVE IN APRIL AND SO FAR WE'VE NOT FOUND INTRANSIGENTS
POD1000000015_S0000166	AND I THINK SOME OF THIS IS DRAWING ON EXPERIENCE OF
POD1000000015_S0000167	INFORMATION COMMISSIONER THAT I'LL GIVE YOU A VERY SIMPLE EXAMPLE
POD1000000015_S0000168	SIMILAR POWERS TO COMPELL PRODUCTION OF INFORMATION FOR AN INVESTIGATION
POD1000000015_S0000169	AND TELLING PUBLIC BODIES VERY FORMALLY IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE THIS THIS AND THIS BY THIS DATE I WILL REPORT ON THIS I WILL TAKE FURTHER ACTION
POD1000000015_S0000170	IT CAN ACTUALLY BE CONTEMPT OF TREATED AS CONTEMPT OF COURT IN SCOTLAND
POD1000000015_S0000171	SO YOU ONLY NEED TO MAKE THAT CLEAR THAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT AND TO DO IT ONCE AND THEN REPORT ON IT IN YOUR ANNUAL REPORT
POD1000000015_S0000172	AND ACTUALLY PUBLIC BODIES REALIZE I THINK THAT YOU'RE BEING SERIOUS
POD1000000015_S0000173	BUT WE TRY TO GET TO THE POINT BEFORE THAT WHERE YOU POINT OUT THIS IS THE VALUE PARTICULARLY FOR THE COMPLAINER OF DOING THIS
POD1000000015_S0000174	SO WE'RE IN EARLY DAYS WE HAVEN'T COME ACROSS THE REAL INTRANSIGENCE YET
POD1000000015_S0000175	BUT I'VE NO DOUBT THAT THERE'LL BE SOME THERE AT SOME POINT
POD1000000015_S0000176	BUT THE WORD CIVILIZED IS A GOOD ONE AND WE WILL ENDEAVOUR TO BE AS CIVILIZED AS WE CAN BUT FIRM WITH IT
POD1000000015_S0000177	WHAT IS YOUR YOU REPORT TO THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT
POD1000000015_S0000178	E
POD1000000015_S0000179	WHAT IS YOUR RELATIONSHIP LIKE WITH THAT BODY
POD1000000015_S0000180	I'D SAY IT'S PRETTY GOOD IN THE SENSE OF IT'S OPEN CHALLENGING AND WHEN I SAY FRIENDLY I DON'T MEAN WE'RE ALL FRIENDS IT'S IT'S IT'S VERY PROFESSIONAL IN MANY WAYS
POD1000000015_S0000181	SO I MY MAIN DEALINGS ARE WITH THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENTARY CORPORATE BODY
POD1000000015_S0000182	I GET MY FUNDING THROUGH THEM SO WE HAVE CONTACT WITH THEM ON A FAIRLY REGULAR BASIS
POD1000000015_S0000183	EACH YEAR I APPEAR BEFORE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND COMMUNITIES COMMITTEE TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR MY ANNUAL REPORT
POD1000000015_S0000184	O THEY'LL ASK ME QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR PERFORMANCE ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING
POD1000000015_S0000185	I DO APPEAR BEFORE OTHER COMMITTEES AS WELL EITHER IN RELATION TO OTHER POLICIES OR IN RELATION TO OTHER CONSULTATIONS THAT WE'VE RESPONDED TO
POD1000000015_S0000186	I WOULD SAY IN SCOTLAND THAT GENERALLY THE OMBUDSMAN IS HELD IN HIGH REGARD AND SEEN AS BEING INDEPENDENT AND IMPARTIAL
POD1000000015_S0000187	AND PROBABLY THE THE MOST TELLING EVIDENCE OF THIS IS WE'RE TAKING ON NEW POWERS NEXT YEAR
POD1000000015_S0000188	THIS IS ABOUT WHISTLEBLOWNG
POD1000000015_S0000189	YES WE'RE I'M TAKING ON THE WONDERFUL TITLE OF INDEPENDENT NATIONAL WHISTLEBLOWING OFFICER FOR THE N HS IN SCOTLAND
POD1000000015_S0000190	WOW
POD1000000015_S0000191	AND THE REASON THAT WE ARE TAKING ON THIS FUNCTION IS BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT'S PUBLIC CONSULTATION IT WAS SUGGESTED IT SHOULD BE THE OMBUDSMAN
POD1000000015_S0000192	I'S ANOTHER GOOD EXAMPLE OF HOW IN A SMALLER JURISDICTION YOU GET A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS
POD1000000015_S0000193	BUT GOING BACK TO PARLIAMENT THEY HAVE HELD ME TO ACCOUNT ON THINGS BUT ALSO WHERE I HAVE BROUGHT SOMETHING TO THEM IN MY MY COMMITTEE APPEARANCES THEY'VE ALSO BEEN QUITE SUPPORTIVE
POD1000000015_S0000194	SO ONE OF MY BEFS ABOUT MY LEGISLATION IS COMPLAINTS MUST BE IN WRITING UNLESS THERE ARE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES
POD1000000015_S0000195	NOW THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THE ONUS IS ON THE COMPLAINER TO SHOW SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES
POD1000000015_S0000196	AND IT MEANS YOU CAN'T BE AS FLEXIBLE IN HOW YOU TAKE COMPLAINTS
POD1000000015_S0000197	
POD1000000015_S0000198	AND I'VE BEEN TRYING SINCE I BECAME OMBUDSMAN TO HAVE THE LEGISLATION IT'S SECONDARY LEGISLATION TO SAY I CAN TAKE COMPLAINTS IN ANY FORMAT
POD1000000015_S0000199	AND AT THE LAST PARLIAMENTARY APPEARANCE THE COMMITTEE DID ACTUALLY WRITE TO THE GOVERNMENT AND SAY WE THINK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA PLEASE COULD YOU LOOK INTO THIS AGAIN FOR US
POD1000000015_S0000200	SADLY THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT ARE NOT TAKING IT FORWARD AT THIS TIME BECAUSE THEY HAVE OTHER BUSINESS AND DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCE APPARENTLY WHICH IS VERY DISAPPOINTING
POD1000000015_S0000201	WE'RE COMING TOWARDS THE END BUT LET ME ASK YOU A FEW QUICK FIRE QUESTIONS
POD1000000015_S0000202	YOU'RE FUNDED DIFFERENTLY TO THE WAY WE'RE FUNDED BECAUSE WE WE GET OUR MONEY FROM A BROAD TREASURY VOTE
POD1000000015_S0000203	BUT YOU'RE FUNDED THROUGH PARLIAMENT
POD1000000015_S0000204	HAVE YOU GOT ENOUGH MONEY IS THAT A SATISFACTORY WAY TO DO THINGS
POD1000000015_S0000205	KNOW I HAVEN'T GOT ENOUGH MONEY
POD1000000015_S0000206	AND IT'S SATISFACTORY IN THE SENSE OF I THINK IT IS GOOD THAT THE FUNDING DOESN'T COME FROM GOVERNMENT
POD1000000015_S0000207	IT ADDS SOMETHING TO YOUR BEING ABLE TO SAY I AM INDEPENDENT WHAT I THINK IS UNSATISFACTORY ABOUT IT IS AND PROBABLY THE SAME FOR YOU IS THE ANNUALITY OF IT
POD1000000015_S0000208	IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DO PROPER BUSINESS AND RESOURCE PLANNING WHEN YOU CAN'T GUARANTEE YOU WILL HAVE THE MONEY TO DO IT NEXT YEAR
POD1000000015_S0000209	IT ALSO MEANS THAT I FEEL I DO GO THROUGH SOME FAIRLY UNNECESSARY HOOPS JUST TO GET ONE ADDITIONAL MEMBER OF STAFF OR AN EXTRA LITTLE BIT OF MONEY FOR THIS
POD1000000015_S0000210	WHERE IT DOES WORK WELL AND WHERE I THINK THE CORPORATE BODI REALLY TRY HARD FOR MYSELF AND OTHER PARLIAMENTARY CROWN APPOINTMENTS
POD1000000015_S0000211	IS THEY HOLD A CONTINGENCY FUND TO WHICH WE CAN APPLY
POD1000000015_S0000212	FOR UNEXPECTED THINGS SO IF WE WERE JUDICIALLY REVIEWED WE COULD GET LEGAL COSTS THROUGH THAT
POD1000000015_S0000213	AND THAT WORKS WELL TO HE POINT WE HAD SOME UNEXPECTED IT COSTS THIS YEAR WHICH WE WERE ABLE TO GO TO THE CONTINGENCY FUND
POD1000000015_S0000214	BUT GENERALLY I THINK OMBUDSMEN ACROSS THE U K ARE UNDERFUNDED
POD1000000015_S0000215	IF WE HAD SUFFICIENT FUNDING WE WOULDN'T HAVE BACKLOGS OF CASES WE WOULD BE DOING THINGS QUICKER
POD1000000015_S0000216	BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE DO WITH WHERE WE ARE AT THE MOMENT
POD1000000015_S0000217	TWO FINAL QUESTIONS ROSEMURRY FIRST OF ALL GOING FORWARD WHAT'S YOUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE AS THE OMBUDSMAN
POD1000000015_S0000218	ARE YOU AN OMBUDS OR ARE YOU AN OMBUDSMAN
POD1000000015_S0000219	I'M HAPPY TO BE AN OMBUDSMAN BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE LEGISLATION SAYS AND I KNOW THE ORIGINS OF THE WORD
POD1000000015_S0000220	BUT EQUALLY I DON'T MIND IF OTHER PEOPLE CALL ME SOMETHING SIMILAR WHATEVER THEY'RE COMFORTABLE WITH
POD1000000015_S0000221	IT'S THE SPIRIT OF WHAT WE DO THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
POD1000000015_S0000222	I THINK MY BIGGEST CHALLENGE AND THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE FOR MY OFFICE IS A COMBINATION OF RESOURCING AND THE WHISTLEBLOWING WORK THAT'S COMING NEXT YEAR
POD1000000015_S0000223	THAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT IN SOME WAYS
POD1000000015_S0000224	WILL YOU HAVE REGULATORY POWERS
POD1000000015_S0000225	MY POWERS WILL BE VERY SIMILAR AS THEY ARE TO OMBUDSMAN
POD1000000015_S0000226	
POD1000000015_S0000228	SIS BIG
POD1000000015_S0000229	
POD1000000015_S0000230	AND IT'S VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT HAPPENS IN ENGLAND
POD1000000015_S0000231	IT'S IT'S ALMOST TWOO SIMILAR BUT COMPLETELY DISTINCT FUNCTIONS
POD1000000015_S0000232	TWO DIFFERENT TITLES THAT GO WITH THEM OMBUDSMAN AND INDEPENDENT
POD1000000015_S0000234	AS A RESULT OF THAT
POD1000000015_S0000235	I DON'T KNOW
POD1000000015_S0000237	I SAY I WOULD LIKE ONE THE ID DO THE JOB ANYWAY
POD1000000015_S0000238	BUT I SUPPOSE FOR ME THE ISSUE OF THE PAY IS NOT SO MUCH FOR MY TENURE BUT FOR FUTURE OMBUDSMAN
POD1000000015_S0000239	BECAUSE I HAVE A REAL CONCERN ACROSS IN COMMON WITH FELLOW OMBUDSMEN IN THE U K THAT
POD1000000015_S0000240	IF YOU DON'T PAY YOUR OMBUDSMAN ENOUGH TO ATTRACT GOOD OMBUDSMEN YOU CAN'T FOREVER RELY ON WHAT I THINK HAS HAPPENED SO FAR
POD1000000015_S0000241	JUST IN SCOTLAND WE'VE JUST GOT GOOD PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN ATTRACTED TO THE WORK
POD1000000015_S0000242	
POD1000000015_S0000243	SO I HOPE THEY UP THE PAY BUT IF IT'S NOT FOR ME I DON'T MIND
POD1000000015_S0000244	WHAT DOES THE LEGISLATION SAY ABOUT SECOND TERMS FOR ONBUDS
POD1000000015_S0000245	IN SCOTLAND THERE ARE NO SECOND TERMS
POD1000000015_S0000246	YOU AFTER FIVE YEARS YOU HAVE TO MOVE ON DO U
POD1000000015_S0000247	I
POD1000000015_S0000249	SO UNDER PUBLIC SECTOR LAW IT CAN BE FOUR TO EIGHT YEARS
POD1000000015_S0000250	SO AS INFORMATION COMMISSIONER I ACTUALLY HAD A SIX YEAR TENURE THIS ONE IS EIGHT YEARS
POD1000000015_S0000251	BUT AT THE POINT THAT I BECAME OMBUDSMAN IT WAS ALREADY KNOWN THAT WE WOULD BE TAKING ON THE WHISTLEBLOWING SO IT'S PROBABLY RIGHT FOR THAT
POD1000000015_S0000252	CAUSE JUST HE THE NEARLY THREE YEARS GETTING TO THE POINT OF KNOWING WHAT THE LEGISLATION IS GOING TO SAY HAS BEEN OVER IN A BLINK OF AN EYE
POD1000000015_S0000253	OKAY LAST QUESTION WE'RE IN MANCHESTER THIS IS A YOUNG THRIVING ORGANIZATION FULL OF YOUNG GRADUATES WHO'VE JUST COME INTO THE OMBUDSMAN WORLD

POD1000000015_S0000256	WHAT WOULD BE YOUR ADVICE TO MY COLLEAGUES JUST COMING INTO THE OMBUDS FIELD
POD1000000015_S0000257	DON'T EVER LOSE SIGHT OF THE PASSION OF WHAT DRIVES YOU TO DO THE RIGHT THING FOR THE RIGHT REASONS
POD1000000015_S0000258	BUT LEAVE OMBUDSMANNING FOR A WHILE AND GO AND DO SOMETHING ELSE AND COME BACK TO IT

POD1000000016_S0000023	IT WAS AFTER THE FEAR HAD TURNED TO DESPAIR AND THE DESPAIR TO RESIGNATION AND THE RESIGNATION GAVE WAY FINALLY TO RESOLVE
POD1000000016_S0000025	THEY KNEW THEN THAT THEY WOULD NOT HUG THEIR GRANDMOTHERS AGAIN OR SHARE A LAUGH WITH A COUSIN DURING HIS NUPTUIALS OR SING THEIR BABIES SOFTLY TO SLEEP WITH THE SAME LULLABIES THAT THEIR MOTHERS HAD ONCE SUNG TO THEM

POD1000000016_S0000046	SO THESE WERE THEIR PEOPLE NOW
POD1000000016_S0000048	WHAT HAPPENED HERE
POD1000000016_S0000050	I MEAN WE REALLY DON'T KNOW A LOT
POD1000000016_S0000052	A PIRATE SHIP BY THE NAME OF WHITE LION SAILS INTO THE BAY HERE
POD1000000016_S0000053	AND THEY NEEDED TO TRADE SOMETHING OF VALUE SO THAT THEY COULD GET SUPPLIES TO MAKE THE REST OF THEIR JOURNEY AND WHAT THEY TRADED WERE TWENTY TO THIRTY AFRICANS
POD1000000016_S0000054	AND THIS WOULD BE AT THIS PLACE KIND OF IRONICALLY CALLED POINT COMFORT WHERE SLAVERY IN THE BRITISH NORTH AMERICAN COLONIES THAT WOULD GO ON TO BECOME THE UNITED STATES BEGINS

POD1000000016_S0000061	THAT'S
POD1000000016_S0000062	WHEN I WAS A CHILD MY DAD ALWAYS FLEW A FLAG IN OUR FRONT YARD OUR HOUSE WAS ON A CORNER LOT AND IN THE FRONT YARD RIGHT IN THE CORNER WAS
POD1000000016_S0000063	I COULDN'T TELL YOU HOW TALL IT WAS IT ALWAYS SEEMED REALLY GERISHLY TALL TO ME AT THE TIME THERE WAS THIS VERY TALL ALUMINUM FLAG POLE MY PARENTS DIDN'T MAKE A LOT OF MONEY SO OUR HOUSE ALWAYS HAD PAINT CHIPPING
POD1000000016_S0000064	THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING ABOUT THE HOUSE THAT WAS IN DISARRAY YOU KNOW THE GRASS WAS LOOKING DISHEVELED OR THE RAILING ON THE STAIRS WAS FALLING OFF BUT THE FLAG WAS ALWAYS PRISTINE
POD1000000016_S0000065	AS SOON AS IT STARTED TO SHOW EVEN THE SLIGHTEST TATTER MY DAD WOULD REPLACE THE FLAG WITH A FRESH NEW FLAG
POD1000000016_S0000066	HE WOULD NEVER ALLOW A TATTER FLAG TO FLY AND I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT I I DIDN'T KNOW OTHER BLACK KIDS WHOSE PARENTS WERE FLYING A FLAG IN THEIR FRONT YARD
POD1000000016_S0000067	I KNEW LOTS OF WHITE PEOPLE WHO FLW FLAGS LOTS OF WHITE PEOPLE WHO FLEW FLAGS
POD1000000016_S0000069	MY DAD WAS BORN ON A SHARE CROPPING FARM IN GREENWOOD MISSISSIPPI WHERE HIS FAMILY PICKED COTTON IN THE SAME COTTON FIELDS THAT ENSLAVED PEOPLE HAD PICKED COTTON NOT TOO LONG BEFORE
POD1000000016_S0000070	THAT COUNTY LEFLORA COUNTY IN MISSISSIPPI LINCHED MORE BLACK PEOPLE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTY IN MISSISSIPPI AND MISSISSIPPI LINCHED MORE BLACK PEOPLE THAN ANY OTHER STATE IN THE COUNTRY
POD1000000016_S0000071	SO IT WAS A PRETTY DEVASTATINGLY VIOLENT AND HARD PLACE TO LIVE
POD1000000016_S0000073	MY DAD'S MOM FLED THE SOUTH LIKE MILLIONS OF OTHER BLACK PEOPLE DURING THE GREAT MIGRATION AND CAME NORTH TO WATERLOO AND FOUND MANY OF THE SAME BARRIERS THAT SHE HAD SOUGHT TO ESCAPE
POD1000000016_S0000074	SHE WAS FORCED TO BUY A HOUSE ON THE BLACK SIDE OF TOWN MOST JOBS WERE UNAVAILABLE TO HER SO SHE CLEANED WHITE PEOPLE'S HOUSES MY FATHER WENT TO SEGREGATED SCHOOLS
POD1000000016_S0000075	AND AT A YOUNG AGE MY FATHER JOINED THE MILITARY SO THAT HE COULD GET HIS WAY OUT OF POVERTY BUT ALSO FOR THE REASONS THAT SO MANY BLACK PEOPLE JOINED THE MILITARY
POD1000000016_S0000076	WHICH IS HE HOPED THAT IF HE SERVED HIS COUNTRY HIS COUNTRY MIGHT FINALLY SEE HIM AS AN AMERICAN
POD1000000016_S0000077	HE LOVED BEING IN THE ARMY HE WAS STATIONED IN GERMANY PICKED UP GERMAN VERY QUICKLY HE WAS SO SMART
POD1000000016_S0000078	HE LOVED TALKING ABOUT THAT TIME IT WAS A PERIOD WHERE HE GOT TO SEE THINGS THAT POOR BLACK CHILD BORN IN MISSISSIPPI WOULD NOT NORMALLY GET TO SEE
POD1000000016_S0000079	BUT THE MILITARY DIDN'T END UP BEING A WAY OUT FOR MY DAD FOR LONG HE WAS PASSED UP FOR OPPORTUNITIES
POD1000000016_S0000080	AND THE ONLY JOBS MY DAD EVER WORKED WERE SERVICE JOBS HE WORKED AS A CONVENIENCE STORE CLERK OR A BUS DRIVER AND BECAUSE OF THAT
POD1000000016_S0000081	THIS BIG PRISTINE AMERICAN FLAG FLYING IN THE FRONT OF OUR YARD WAS DEEPLY EMBARRASSING TO ME
POD1000000016_S0000082	AND I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY HE WOULD FEEL THAT MUCH LOVE FOR A COUNTRY THAT CLEARLY DID NOT LOVE HIM
POD1000000016_S0000084	I FELT THIS WAY ALL THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL I WAS NO LONGER STANDING FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM I HAD STOPPED SAYING THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE AND REALLY
POD1000000016_S0000085	THROUGHOUT MOST OF MY ADULT LIFE I MEAN CLEARLY I KNOW I'M AN AMERICAN
POD1000000016_S0000086	I WAS BORN HERE EVERY FAMILY MEMBER FOR GENERATIONS BACK THAT I KNOW WERE ALL BORN HERE BUT I NEVER FELT LIKE I COULD CLAIM FULLY THAT I WAS AN AMERICAN
POD1000000016_S0000088	BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL I REALLY STARTED RESEARCHING AND READING AND THINKING ABOUT THIS PROJECT THAT MY OWN THINKING STARTED TO SHIFT
POD1000000016_S0000089	THAT I REALIZED MY DAD UNDERSTOOD THINGS THAT I NEVER KNEW
POD1000000016_S0000090	I NOW UNDERSTAND FOR THE FIRST TIME WHY MY DAD WAS SO PROUD TO FLY THAT FLAG
POD1000000016_S0000093	MY NAME IS HANN HUGHES I WAS BORN IN CHARLOTSVILLE VIRGINIA
POD1000000016_S0000094	MY GRANDFATHER BELONGED TO THOMAS JEFFERSON MY GRANDFATHER WAS A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN YEARS OLD WHEN HE DIED AND NOW I AM ONE HUNDREDAND ONE YEAR
POD1000000016_S0000095	NOW IN MY BOY DAYS WE WERE SLAVES WE BELONGED TO PEOPLE THEY SELL US LIKE YOU SELL HORSES AND COWS AND HOG AND ALL LIKE THAT HAVE AN AUXTION BENCH
POD1000000016_S0000096	PUT YOU UP ON THE BENCH AND BET ON YOU JUST SAME AS YOU'RE BITDING ON CATM YOU KNOW
POD1000000016_S0000097	BUT STILL I DO'N' LIKE TOER BECAUSE IT MAKES TMAKES PEOPLE FEEL BAD
POD1000000016_S0000099	SO YOU KIND O HAVE TO PUT YOURSELF IN THE SCENE IT IS JUNE OF SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SIX AND THOMAS JEFFERSON
POD1000000016_S0000100	AT THE VERY YOUNG AGE OF THIRTY THREE YEARS OLD HAS BEEN TASKED WITH DRAFTING THE DOCUMENT THAT IS GOING TO DECLARE TO THE WORLD WHY THE BRITISH NORTH AMERICAN COLONIES THE THIRTEEN COLONIES WANT TO BREAK OFF FROM THE BRITISH EMPIRE
POD1000000016_S0000101	HE GOES TO PHILADELPHIA AND RENTS TWO ROOMS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN ALONG THE RIVER AND SITS DOWN TO DRAFT WHAT WE ALL KNOW NOW AS THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE
POD1000000016_S0000102	WHEN IN THE COURSE OF HUMAN EVENTS IT BECOMES NECESSARY FOR ONE PEOPLE TO DISSOLVE THE POLITICAL BANDS WHICH HAVE CONNECTED THEM WITH ANOTHER
POD1000000016_S0000104	HE'S SITTING AT THIS PORTABLE MAHOGANY WRITING DESK THAT HE CARRIES WITH HIM AND HE PULLS OUT SOME PAPER AND A VERY NICE QUILL PEN
POD1000000016_S0000105	AND HE STARTS TO WRITE THESE WORDS THAT ALMOST EVERY AMERICAN CAN RECITE BY HEART
POD1000000016_S0000106	DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS HOLD SELF EVIDEN
POD1000000016_S0000108	THEY BECOME SOME OF THE MOST FAMOUS WORDS IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE
POD1000000016_S0000109	HTHEY ARE ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN
POD1000000016_S0000111	LIFE AND LIBERTY IND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS THAT'S WHAT MAKES US UNIQUE THAT'S WHAT MAKES US STRONG THE SHARED VALUES THAT WE ALL HOLD SO DEAR
POD1000000016_S0000113	BUT WHAT MOST AMERICANS DON'T KNOW IS THAT WHILE HE'S WRITING THESE LOFTY WORDS FOR LIBERATION
POD1000000016_S0000114	HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM ONE OF THE MANY ENSLAVED PEOPLE WHOM HE OWNED IN ORDER TO SERVE HIM AND TO KEEP HIM COMFORTABLE NOW THAT ENSLAVED PERSON WAS A TEENAGER
POD1000000016_S0000115	AND THAT TEENAGER WAS THE HALF BROTHER OF THOMAS JEFFERSON'S WIFE WHAT THAT MEANS IS THOMAS JEFFERSON'S FATHER IN LAW HAD CHILDREN WITH ONE OF THE WOMEN THAT HE ENSLAVED
POD1000000016_S0000116	SO ACTUALLY HE WAS THOMAS JEFFERSON'S BROTHER IN LAW AND SO AS HE'S WRITING THESE IDEALS HE KNOWS THAT THEY WILL NOT APPLY EVEN TO HIS OWN FAMILY MEMBERS
POD1000000016_S0000118	AT THE TIME THAT THOMAS JEFFERSON IS DRAFTING THE DECLARATION A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THOSE FIRST AFRICANS WERE SOLD INTO VIRGINIA
POD1000000016_S0000119	THE ENSLAVED POPULATION HAS GROWN FROM TWENTY TO NOW FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE FULLY ONE FIFTH OF THE POPULATION IS NOW ENSLAVED
POD1000000016_S0000120	IT HAS GROWN FROM A CONDITIONAL INSTITUTION WHERE SOME OF THOSE FIRST TWENTY WERE ABLE TO BECOME FREE AFTER A TERM OF TIME TO ONE WHERE BLACK PEOPLE ARE BORN INTO IT
POD1000000016_S0000121	THEY DIE INTO IT AND THEY PASS THAT STATUS ON TO THEIR CHILDREN YOU NOW HAVE GENERATIONS OF BLACK PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER KNOWN A DAY OF FREEDOM AND WHO WILL NEVER KNOW A DAY OF FREEDOM
POD1000000016_S0000122	AND YET WHEN THOMAS JEFFERSON'S CONTEMPORARIES TALK IN PUBLIC ABOUT WHY THE COLONISTS NEED TO BE FREE FROM ENGLAND THEY REFER TO THEMSELVES AS SLAVES
POD1000000016_S0000123	AS SLAVES TO THE KING OF ENGLAND AND SO THE COLONISTS ARE BEING CRITICIZED IN NEWSPAPERS FOR THIS OBVIOUS DUPLICITY BY THOSE WHO DON'T BELIEVE THAT THEY SHOULD BREAK OFF FROM THE BRITISH EMPIRE
POD1000000016_S0000124	ONE OF THEM WRITES HOW IS IT THAT WE HEAR THE LOUDEST YELPS FOR FREEDOM FROM THE DRIVERS OF NEGROES ANOTHER WRITES TO BENJAMIN FRANKLIN AND SAYS PERHAPS YOU SHOULD ASK THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY ENSLAVED WHAT SLAVERY IS LIKE
POD1000000016_S0000125	THOMAS JEFFERSON OF COURSE IS DEEPLY AWARE OF THE HYPOCRISY AND AWARE OF THE CRITICISM OF THE HYPOCRISY SO AS HE'S DRAFTING THE DECLARATION
POD1000000016_S0000126	HE INCLUDES A PASSAGE IN THERE WHERE HE ACTUALLY BLAMES THE KING OF ENGLAND FOR INTRODUCING SLAVERY INTO THE COLONIES HE CALLS SLAVERY A CRIME AND HE SAYS THAT THE KING OF ENGLAND COMMITTED THIS CRIME
POD1000000016_S0000127	BUT THAT'S NOT OUR FAULT IT WAS NOT OUR DOING THIS IS JUST ONE MORE THING THAT THE KING OF ENGLAND DID TO WRONG US SO HE BRINGS THIS DOCUMENT TO THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS
POD1000000016_S0000128	AND IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG BEFORE DELEGATES FROM THE CAROLINAS AND FROM GEORGIA LOOK AT THAT LANGUAGE ABOUT SLAVERY AND ONE CAN IMAGINE THEY SAID WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING
POD1000000016_S0000129	AND THEY SAY THAT THERE IS NO WAY THAT THEY ARE GOING TO SIGN THIS DOCUMENT AS LONG AS THAT PASSAGE ABOUT SLAVERY REMAINS AND SO IT IS STRUCK AND THE THIRTEEN COLONIES SIGNE THE DECLARATION
POD1000000016_S0000130	AND THE DECLARATION GOES OUT INTO THE WORLD WITHOUT MENTIONING SLAVERY AT ALL AND WE START THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR
POD1000000016_S0000132	SOMEHOW MIRACULOUSLY THESE THIRTEEN SCRAPPY COLONIES MANAGED TO DEFEAT ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL EMPIRES IN THE WORLD AND WE BECOME A NEW NATION
POD1000000016_S0000133	AND SO THE COLONISTS GATHER AND THEY TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE LANGUAGE THAT THEY 'RE GOING TO CREATE IN THE FOUNDING DOCUMENT THAT WE OF COURSE COME TO KNOW AS THE CONSTITUTION BUT NOW THEY HAVE A PROBLEM
POD1000000016_S0000134	THEY WERE TRYING TO LEAVE BEHIND AN OLD COUNTRY THAT THEY BELIEVED WAS ANTITHETICAL TO FREEDOM AND CREATE A NEW ONE THAT THEY BELIEVED WOULD BE DEFINED BY FREEDOM
POD1000000016_S0000135	THIS WAS A COUNTRY THAT WAS GOING TO BE BASED ON INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS ON A GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE FOR THE PEOPLE AND BY THE PEOPLE
POD1000000016_S0000136	BUT THIS WAS ALSO A PLACE THAT AT THIS TIME WAS STILL PRACTICING THE INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY
POD1000000016_S0000137	AND SO THE COLONISTS HAVE A CHOICE TO MAKE ARE THEY GOING TO BE THE COUNTRY OF THEIR IDEALS THE IDEALS THAT THEY WERE PUTTING TO PAPER A COUNTRY BASED ON THE IDEA THAT ALL MEN WERE CREATED EQUAL
POD1000000016_S0000138	AND IF THEY WERE GOING TO BE THAT COUNTRY THEN THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE TO ABOLISH THE INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY OR WERE THEY GOING TO BE WEDDED TO THE INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY BECAUSE THEY DEPENDED SO HEAVILY ON THE WEALTH THAT WAS BEING GENERATED FROM IT
POD1000000016_S0000139	AND IN THAT CASE THEY CAN'T REALLY WRITE THE DOCUMENT THAT THEY WANT TO WRITE AND SO WHAT THEY DO IS THEY DECIDE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO HAVE IT BOTH WAYS
POD1000000016_S0000140	AND THEY BAKED THAT CONTRADICTION RIGHT INTO THE CONSTITUTION BOTH CODIFYING AND PROTECTING THE INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY BUT NEVER ACTUALLY MENTIONING THE WORD
POD1000000016_S0000141	AND SO THEY HAVE WRITTEN WHAT IS PERHAPS THE MOST RADICAL CONSTITUTION IN THE WORLD AND FROM THE BEGINNING THEY KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO VIOLATE ITS MOST ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES
POD1000000016_S0000143	THEY CALL THIS NEW COUNTRY A DEMOCRACY BUT IT WASN'T ONE NOT YET
POD1000000016_S0000145	ON AUGUST FOURTEEN EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO ABRAHAM LINCOLN INVITES FIVE FREE BLACK MEN TO THE WHITE HOUSE FOR A MEETING
POD1000000016_S0000146	THEY ARE PART OF THE BLACK ELITE IN WASHINGTON DC AND HE WANTS TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THEM
POD1000000016_S0000147	THE CIVIL WAR HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND ABRAHAM LINCOLN IS WORRIED BECAUSE THE WAR IS NOT GOING WELL AND BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOING WELL HE'S FEELING LIKE HE MIGHT HAVE TO DO SOMETHING DRASTIC
POD1000000016_S0000148	HE'S CONSIDERING TAKING THIS VERY RADICAL STEP OF LIBERATING ALL OF THE ENSLAVED PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE CONFEDERATE STATES
POD1000000016_S0000149	AND HE'S THINKING ABOUT DOING THIS AS A WAR TACTIC UNDERSTANDING THAT IF HE TAKES AWAY THE SOUTH'S LABOR FORCE THAT MIGHT CRIPPLE THEM OR AT LEAST THE THREAT OF IT WOULD FORCE THEM TO REMAIN IN THE UNION
POD1000000016_S0000150	BUT HE'S ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT IT MIGHT MEAN TO SUDDENLY FREE FOUR MILLION ENSLAVED PEOPLE AND WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT MIGHT BE
POD1000000016_S0000152	I CAN IMAGINE THESE FIVE DISTINGUISHED MEN ARE VERY EXCITED TO GET LINCOLN'S INVITATION THEY ARE ABOLITIONISTS THEY HAVE BEEN PRESSURING LINCON TO ABOLISH SLAVERY
POD1000000016_S0000153	BUT WHEN THEY GET THERE THEY ARE GREETED BY PRESIDENT LINCOLN AND ANOTHER MAN HIS NAME IS JAMES MITCHELL NOW JAMES MITCHELL IS A NEW EMPLOYEE HE'S ONLY BEEN AT THE WHITE HOUSE FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS
POD1000000016_S0000154	AND HIS JOB IS A NEW JOB AND IT'S CALLED COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION NOW THAT'S IMMIGRATION WITH A E MEANING HIS JOB WAS NOT TO HELP PEOPLE TO ENTER THE COUNTRY BUT TO HELP PEOPLE TO EXIT IT
POD1000000016_S0000156	LINCOLN DOESN'T WASTE ANY TIME ACCORDING TO DOCUMENTS THAT RECOUNT WHAT HAPPENED THAT DAY
POD1000000016_S0000158	HE TELLS THE MEN THAT HE HAD GOTTEN FUNDS FROM CONGRESS TO SHIP BLACK PEOPLE ONCE THEY HAD BEEN FREED TO SOME OTHER COUNTRY
POD1000000016_S0000160	ND THEN LINCOLN SAID YOU AND WE ARE DIFFERENT RACES YOUR RACE SUFFER VERY GREATLY MANY OF THEM BY LIVING AMONGST US WHILE OURS SUFFER FROM YOUR PRESENCE
POD1000000016_S0000161	IN A WORD HE SAID WE SUFFER ON EACH SIDE
POD1000000016_S0000163	WE ARE TAUGHT TO THINK OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN AS THE GREAT EMANCIPATOR AND HE WAS BUT THE TRUTH IS LIKE MANY WHITE AMERICANS HE WAS OPPOSED TO SLAVERY BECAUSE IT WAS A CRUEL AND UNJUST INSTITUTION IN OPPOSITION TO THIS NATION'S IDEALS
POD1000000016_S0000164	BUT HE WAS ALSO OPPOSED TO BLACK POLITICAL AND SOCIAL EQUALITY AS HE SAID IN A SPEECH THAT HE GAVE IN EIGHTE FIFTY THREE HE CONSIDERED BLACK PEOPLE A QUOTE TROUBLESOME PRESENCE
POD1000000016_S0000165	AND THAT THEY WERE INCOMPATIBLE WITH TA DEMOCRACY THAT WAS DESIGNED FOR WHITE PEOPLE AS HE SAID IN THAT SPEECH FREE THEM AND MAKE THEM POLITICALLY AND SOCIALLY OUR EQUALS MY OWN FEELINGS WILD NOT ADMIT OF THIS AND IF MINE WOULD
POD1000000016_S0000166	WE WELL KNOW THAT THOSE OF THE GREAT MASS OF WHITE PEOPLE WILL NOT
POD1000000016_S0000168	AS THOSE FIVE BLACK MEN STOOD IN THE WHITE HOUSE I WONDER WHAT IT MUST HAVE FELT LIKE
POD1000000016_S0000170	THESE MEN HAD BEEN FIGHTING FOR THE LIBERATIONS OF MILLIONS AND HAD WAITED FOR THIS MOMENT ONLY TO BE TOLD THAT ONCE THEY WERE GRANTED THEIR FREEDOM THEY WERE GOING TO BE ASKED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY OF THEIR BIRTH
POD1000000016_S0000172	AND TO MAKE IT EVEN WORSE LINCOLN THEN TELLS THEM THAT IT'S THEIR FAULT THAT THE COUNTRY IS FIGHTING A CIVIL WAR AT ALL
POD1000000016_S0000173	HE SAYS ALTHOUGH MANY MEN ENGAGED ON EITHER SIDE DO NOT CARE FOR YOU ONE WAY OR THE OTHER WITHOUT THE INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY AND THE COLORED RACE AS A BASIS THE WAR COULD NOT HAVE AN EXISTENCE
POD1000000016_S0000174	THAT'S WHY THE PRESIDENT SAID IT IS BETTER FOR US BOTH THEREFORE TO BE SEPARATED
POD1000000016_S0000176	SO LINCOLN ENDS THE MEETING AND ONE OF THE MEN TELLS HIM THAT THEY WILL GO BACK AND CONSIDER HIS PROPOSAL LINCOLN THEN TELLS THEM TAKE YOUR FULL TIME NO HURRY AT ALL
POD1000000016_S0000178	AFTER THAT MEETING THOSE MEN MADE IT CLEAR THAT THEY WERE NOT INTERESTED IN TAKING LINCOLN UP ON HIS OFFER TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY OF THEIR BIRTH
POD1000000016_S0000180	THERE'S A QUOTE BY A DIFFERENT GROUP OF BLACK ABOLITIONISTS THAT REALLY SUMS UP THE WAY THAT MOST BLACK AMERICANS FELT AND THAT QUOTE SAID THIS IS OUR HOME AND THIS IS OUR COUNTRY
POD1000000016_S0000181	BENEATH ITS SOD LIE THE BONES OF OUR FATHERS HERE WE WERE BORN AND HERE WE WILL DIE
POD1000000016_S0000183	AFTER EVERYTHING THAT BLACK AMERICANS HAVE BEEN THROUGH IN THIS COUNTRY THAT THEY DIDN'T IMMEDIATELY TAKE UP LINCOLN'S OFFER AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE AND START OVER IS REALLY AN ASTOUNDING TESTIMONY TO THEIR BELIEF IN THE AMERICAN IDEALS
POD1000000016_S0000185	BY CHOOSING TO STAY BLACK PEOPLE WERE SAYING THIS IS OUR COUNTRY WE ARE AMERICAN AND WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO WORK TO MAKE THESE FOUNDING IDEALS A REALITY
POD1000000016_S0000187	AND IN THE YEARS THAT FOLLOWED AFTER THE CIVIL WAR ENDS A VERY SHORT PERIOD CALLED RECONSTRUCTION BEGAN
POD1000000016_S0000189	AND SO YOU SEE THE FORMERLY ENSLAVED PUSHING THEIR WHITE ALLIES IN CONGRESS TO START TO CHANGE OUR FOUNDING DOCUMENT AND TO ACTUALLY RESOLVE THOSE CONTRADICTIONS THAT WERE BAKED IN
POD1000000016_S0000190	THEY DO THIS THROUGH GETTING AMENDMENTS PASSED AND OF COURSE AMENDMENTS ARE THE WAY THAT WE CHANGE OUR CONSTITUTION
POD1000000016_S0000192	SO OF COURSE THE VERY FIRST AMENDMENT THAT THEY HAVE TO PASS IS THE THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT WHICH ABOLISHES THE INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY
POD1000000016_S0000193	AND WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THAT IS THIS IS ACTUALLY THE FIRST TIME THAT THE WORD SLAVERY IS MENTIONED IN THE CONSTITUTION IS IN THE AMENDMENT THAT FINALLY ABOLISHES IT
POD1000000016_S0000195	IT ALSO ENSURES FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT THE LAWS CANNOT TREAT PEOPLE DIFFERENTLY BASED ON THEIR RACE THIS IS CALLED THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE
POD1000000016_S0000196	AND THIS CLAUSE WILL BE USED AGAIN AND AGAIN REALLY ALL THE WAY UP UNTIL NOW TO GUARANTEE THAT ALL AMERICANS ARE TREATED AS EQUAL CITIZENS
POD1000000016_S0000198	AND FINALLY THEY PASSED THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT WHICH PROBABLY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT AMENDMENT WHEN WE'RE CONSIDERING WHAT A DEMOCRACY IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT GUARANTEED THE RIGHT TO VOTE NO MATTER WHAT YOUR RACE IS
POD1000000016_S0000199	NOW IT DIDN'T INCLUDE WOMEN AT THAT TIME BUT IT CERTAINLY SET THE STAGE AND IT FOR THE FIRST TIME GUARANTEED THAT WHETHER YOU WERE BORN A PERSON WHO WAS ENLAVED WHETHER YOU'RE WHITE OR YOU WERE BLACK YOU HAD THE RIGHT TO EXERCISE YOUR VOTE IN THIS DEMOCRACY
POD1000000016_S0000201	THE ONLY REASON WE SAW ALL OF THESE GAINS IN THE SOUTH WAS BECAUSE THERE WERE FEDERAL TROOPS THERE AND THOSE FEDERAL TROOPS WERE HOLDING BACK THE VIOLENCE OF WHITE SOUTHERNERS WHO WERE NOT INTERESTED IN SEEING THESE GAINS
POD1000000016_S0000202	THIS ALL CHANGES WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX
POD1000000016_S0000204	IT WAS A CONTESTED ELECTION AND RUTHIVER B HAYS IS THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE AND REMEMBER BACK THEN IT WAS REPUBLICANS WHO WERE THE PROGRESSIVE PARTY AND THEY WERE THE PARTY OF LINCOLN THAT WAS WORKING TO PASS ALL OF THIS PROGRESSIVE LEGISLATION
POD1000000016_S0000206	BUT RATHEFER B HAYS REALLY WANTS TO WIN THIS ELECTION
POD1000000016_S0000207	AND SO HE MAKES A DEAL WITH THE DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS THAT IF THEY GIVE HIM THEIR ELECTORAL VOTES HE WILL WITHDRAW THE FEDERAL TROOPS FROM THE SOUTH AND END RECONSTRUCTION
POD1000000016_S0000209	SO HE MAKES THE DEAL AND THE TROOPS LEAVE AND WE IMMEDIATELY SEE WHITE SOUTHERNERS IMPLEMENT A CAMPAIGN TO FORCE BLACK PEOPLE BACK INTO THE POSITION THAT THEY HAD BEEN IN BEFORE RECONSTRUCTION
POD1000000016_S0000211	THE SUPPRESSION OF BLACK LIFE OVER THE NEXT FIVE DECADES WOULD BE SO DEVASTATING THAT IT WOULD COME TO BE KNOWN AS THE GREAT NADIER THE SECOND SLAVERY
POD1000000016_S0000213	TELL YOU THE TRUTH WHEN I THINK OF IT TODAY I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M LIVING I'M THE OLDEST ONE THAT I KNOW AS LIVING BUT STILL I'M THANKFUL TO THE LORD

POD1000000016_S0000223	REPORTERS RUSH OUT TO RELAY THE NEWS TO AN ANXIOUS WORLD AND TOUCH OFF CELEBRATIONS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY JOY IS UNCONFINED
POD1000000016_S0000225	IT'S FEBRUARY OF NINEN FORTY SIX AND A YOUNG BLACK MAN IS SITTING ON A BUS WATCHING THE GEORGIA PINES FLY PAST THE WINDOWS HE'S ON HIS WAY TO SEE HIS WIFE AND HE'S PROBABLY VERY EXCITED BECAUSE HE'S BEEN AWAY AT WAR AND HE HASN'T SEEN HER IN A VERY LONG TIME
POD1000000016_S0000226	HE'D BEEN FIGHTING FOR THIS COUNTRY IN WORLD WAR TWO AND JUST THAT DAY HE'D BEEN HONORABLY DISCHARGED FOR HIS SERVICE BUT HE IS A BLACK MAN WHO IS RETURNING TO THE JIM CROW SOUTH
POD1000000016_S0000228	WHAT HAPPENED ON THAT DAY IS A STORY THAT WOULD BE TOLD ACROSS THE COUNTRY
POD1000000016_S0000229	GOOD MORNING THIS IS ORSEN WELL SPEAKING I'D LIKE TO READ TO YOU AN AFHIDAVIT
POD1000000016_S0000230	IT WAS A STORY THAT WOULD ACTUALLY CHANGE THE COURSE OF HISTORY
POD1000000016_S0000232	HE'S RIDING THE BUS THROUGH GEORGIA
POD1000000016_S0000234	HE WANTS TO GET OFF AND USE THE RESTAROOM
POD1000000016_S0000236	HE BUS DRIVER GETS UPSET WITH HIM AND THEY HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A ARGUMENT WADER DOESN'T THINK MUCH OF IT HE GOES TO THE BATHROOM RUNS BACK TO THE BUS AND THE BUS KEEPS GOING BUT THEN A FEW MILES DOWN THE ROAD THE BUS STOPS
POD1000000016_S0000237	AND THE BUS DRIVER GETS OFF THE BUS AND THEN CALLS AND TELLS WOODER THAT HE NEEDS TO GET OFF THE BUS AS WELL SO WOODER GETS OFF THE BUS AND BEFORE HE CAN EVEN UTTER A WORD
POD1000000016_S0000239	E STRUCK IN THE HEAD BY A POLICE OFFICER
POD1000000016_S0000241	AND THE BLOWS KEEP COMING AND THEY KEEP COMING TO THE POINT THAT WATER LOSES CONSCIOUSNESS
POD1000000016_S0000243	WODARD IS STILL WEARING HIS CRISP ARMY UNIFORM HE'S BEEN DISCHARGED JUST A FEW HOURS EARLIER WHEN HE COMES TO HE'S IN A JAIL
POD1000000016_S0000245	I WOKE UP NEXT MORNING AND COULD NOT SEE
POD1000000016_S0000246	HE WAS BEATEN SO SEVERELY BY THAT POLICE OFFICER THAT HE WOULD NEVER SEE AGAIN
POD1000000016_S0000248	SO WATER'S BEATING WAS NOT AT ALL UNUSUAL WORLD WAR TWO HAD DONE EXACTLY WHAT MANY WHITE PEOPLE HAD FEARED
POD1000000016_S0000249	THAT ONCE BLACK PEOPLE WERE ALLOWED TO FIGHT IN THE MILITARY AND WHEN THEY TRAVELED ABROAD AND THEY EXPERIENCED WHAT IT WAS LIKE NOT TO LIVE UNDER A SYSTEM OF RACIAL APARTHEID THAT IT WOULD BE MUCH HARDER TO CONTROL THEM WHEN THEY CAME BACK
POD1000000016_S0000250	BLACK MEN IN THEIR UNIFORMS WERE SEEING AS BEING UNDULY PROUD SO THESE MEN WHO HAD SERVED THEIR COUNTRY WHO WOULD COME HOME PROUDLY WEARING THE UNIFORM TO SHOW THEIR SERVICE FOR THEIR COUNTRY
POD1000000016_S0000251	WOULD FIND THAT THIS ACTUALLY MADE THEM A TARGET OF SOME OF THE MOST SEVERE VIOLENCE BUT WHAT WAS UNUSUAL WAS WHAT HAPPENED AFTER WADERD'S CASE WAS PICKED UP BY THE N CP AND THEY TAKE HIM ON A BIT OF A TOUR
POD1000000016_S0000252	WHERE THEY'RE SAYING LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS MAN WHO SERVED HIS COUNTRY
POD1000000016_S0000254	AND THAT'S LARGELY SEEN AS ONE OF THE SPARKS OF THE MODERN CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT
POD1000000016_S0000256	THE SECOND SUSTAINED MOVEMENT OF BLACK PEOPLE TRYING TO SECURE EQUAL RIGHTS BEFORE THE LAW AND A EQUAL PLACE IN THIS DEMOCRACY
POD1000000016_S0000258	AND IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF THE FIRST ENSLAVED AFRICANS INTO THE COLONIES
POD1000000016_S0000260	CONGRESS PASSES THE LAST OF THE GREAT CIVIL RIGHTS LEGISLATION
POD1000000016_S0000262	IT ENDS LEGAL DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF RACE FROM ALL ASPECTS OF AMERICAN LIFE
POD1000000016_S0000264	WE OFTEN THINK OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AS BEING ABOUT BLACK RIGHTS BUT THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT WAS NEVER JUST ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF BLACK PEOPLE IT WAS ABOUT MAKING THE IDEALS OF THE CONSTITUTION WHOLE
POD1000000016_S0000265	AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LAWS BORN OUT OF BLACK RESISTANCE THESE LAWS ARE GUARANTEEING RIGHTS FOR ALL AMERICANS
POD1000000016_S0000266	THIS EXPERIENCE WHICH BLACK AMERICANS WERE HAVING DID NOT GO UNNOTICED BY THE REST OF AMERICA
POD1000000016_S0000267	I MEAN BASICALLY EVERY OTHER RIGHTS STRUGGLE THAT WE HAVE SEEN
POD1000000016_S0000269	DISABILITY RIGHTS GAY RIGHTS WOMEN'S RIGHTS
POD1000000016_S0000270	PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WERE STILL VICTIMS OF SEGREGATION AND DISCRIMINATION
POD1000000016_S0000271	ALL COME FROM THE EFFORTS OF THE BLACK CIVIL RIGHTS STRUGGLE
POD1000000016_S0000274	SO WE ARE RAISED TO THINK ABOUT SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SIX AS THE BEGINNING OF OUR DEMOCRACY BUT WHEN THAT SHIP ARRIVES ON THE HORIZON AT POINT COMFORT IN SIXTEEN NINETEEN
POD1000000016_S0000275	THAT DECISION MADE BY THE COLONISTS TO PURCHASE THAT GROUP OF TWENTY TO THIRTY HUMAN BEINGS THAT WAS A BEGINNING TOO
POD1000000016_S0000276	AND IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE THOSE VERY PEOPLE WHO WERE DENIED CITIZENSHIP IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY WHO WERE DENIED THE PROTECTIONS OF OUR FOUNDING DOCUMENTS WHO WOULD FIGHT THE HARDEST AND MOST SUCCESSFULLY TO MAKE THOSE IDEALS REAL
POD1000000016_S0000277	NOT JUST FOR THEMSELVES BUT FOR ALL AMERICANS IT IS BLACK PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN THE PERFECTORS OF THIS DEMOCRACY
POD1000000016_S0000279	WHEN I WAS A KID I MUST HAVE BEEN IN FIFTH OR SIXTH GRADE OUR TEACHER GAVE US AN ASSIGNMENT IT WAS A SOCIAL STUDIES CLASS AND WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT DIFFERENT PLACES THAT PEOPLE CAME FROM
POD1000000016_S0000280	DTHIS WAS HER WAY OF KIND OF TELLING THE STORY OF THE GREAT AMERICAN MELTING POT SO SHE TOLD US ALL TO RESEARCH OUR ANCESTROL LAND AND TO WRITE A SMALL REPORT ABOUT IT AND THEN TO DRAW FLAG
POD1000000016_S0000281	I REMEMBER KIND OF LOOKING UP AND MAKING EYE CONTACT WITH THE OTHER BLACK GIRL WHO WAS IN THE CLASS BECAUSE WE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE AN ANCESTRAL LAND THAT WE KNEW OF
POD1000000016_S0000282	SLAVERY HAD MADE IT SO THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE WE CAME FROM IN AFRICA WE DIDN'T HAVE A SPECIFIC COUNTRY AND WE COULD SAY THAT WE WERE FROM THE WHOLE CONTINENT
POD1000000016_S0000283	BUT EVEN SO THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS AN AFRICAN FLAG AND SO I REMEMBER GOING TO THE GLOBE BY MY TEACHER'S DESK IT WAS ON THE WINDOW PANE ALONG THE LEFT SIDE OF THE CLASSROOM
POD1000000016_S0000284	AND SPINNING IT TO THE CONTINENT OF AFRICA AND JUST PICKING A RANDOM AFRICAN COUNTRY
POD1000000016_S0000285	SO I WENT BACK TO MY DESK AND I DREW THAT RANDOM AFRICAN COUNTRIES FLAG AND I WROTE A REPORT ABOUT IT AND I FELT ASHAMED I FELT ASHAMED ONE BECAUSE I WAS LYING
POD1000000016_S0000286	BUT I ALSO FELT ASHAMED BECAUSE I FELT LIKE I SHOULD HAVE SOME OTHER COUNTRY AND THAT ALL THE OTHER KIDS COULD TRACE THEIR ROOTS ELSEWHERE AND I COULD ONLY TRACE MY ROOTES TO THE COUNTRY THAT HAD ENSLAVED US
POD1000000016_S0000287	I WISH NOW THAT I COULD GO BACK AND TALK TO MY YOUNGER SELF AND TELL HER THAT SHE SHOULD NOT BE ASHAMED
POD1000000016_S0000288	THAT THIS IS HER ANCESTRAL HOME THAT SHE SHOULD BE AS PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN AS HER DAD WAS
POD1000000016_S0000289	AND THAT SHE SHOULD BOLDLY AND PROUDLY DRAW THOSE STARS AND STRIPES AND CLAIM THIS COUNTRY AS HER OWN
POD1000000019_S0000000	THIS EPISODE OF COCAINE AND RINESTONES IS THE SECOND EPISODE IN A THREE PART SERIES ON HARPER VALLEY PTA
POD1000000019_S0000001	IF THIS IS THE FIRST EPISODE OF THE PODCAST YOU ERE LISTENING TO I WOULD RECOMMEND GOING BACK AND AT LEAST LISTENING TO LAST WEEK'S EPISODE BEFORE THIS ONE EVEN IF YOU'RE JUST A HUGE JEANY C RILY FAN AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO SHELBY SINGLETON IS
POD1000000019_S0000002	IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD LAST WEEK'S EPISODE YOU'LL BE MISSING OUT ON A LOT OF CONTEXT AND I'M NOT GOING TO BE DOING VERY MUCH RECAPPING
POD1000000019_S0000004	LAST WEEK WE SPENT SOME TIME LOOKING AT HOW FAR OUTSIDE OF THE BOX SHELLBE SINGLETON WAS WILLING TO GO FOR A HIT SONG NOW ARE WE SURE WE KNOW WHAT A HIT SONG IS HOW TO DEFINE IT
POD1000000019_S0000006	IT'S SAFE TO SAY ANY SONG THAT HITS THE TOP TEN COULD BE CALLED A HIT RIGHT OKAY THIS PAST MAY WHEN I BEGAN WORKING ON THIS PODCAST I SPENT ABOUT A WEEK LISTENING TO EVERY SONG TO EVER GO NUMBER ONE ON THE BILLBOARD COUNTRY CHART
POD1000000019_S0000007	IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER FROM THE FIRST YEAR THE CHART EXISTED IN NINETEN FORTY FOUR UNTIL THIS SHOWS CUTOFF POINT IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND
POD1000000019_S0000008	I NEEDED TO MAKE SURE I'D HEARD THEM ALL TO BUILD A TIMELINE OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE MAINSTREAM OF COUNTRY MUSIC IN THE NINETEEN HUNDREDS THERE WERE QUITE A FEW SONGS I'D NEVER HEARD BEFORE
POD1000000019_S0000009	UNLESS YOU'VE PURPOSEFULLY SAT DOWN TO GIVE YOURSELF THE SAME EXPERIENCE OR SPENT THE PAST SEVENTY SOMETHING YEARS OF YOUR LIFE GLUED TO COUNTRY RADIO THE SAME THING IS TRUE FOR YOU NUMBER ONE SONGS HIT SONGS COMPLETELY ABSENT FROM OUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF COUNTRY MUSIC
POD1000000019_S0000010	EVEN WHEN THE SONG AT NUMBER ONE THE WEEK BEFORE OR THE WEEK AFTER IS ONE OF OUR FAVORITE SONGS OF ALL TIME NOW IMAGINE HOW MANY TOP TEN HITS BETWEEN NINETEEN FORTY FOUR AND THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND WE HAVEN'T HEARD
POD1000000019_S0000011	ROBABLY HUNDREDS OF HIT COUNTRY SONGS YOU'VE NEVER HEARD IN YOUR LIFE I'VE NEVER HEARD IN MY LIFE SO WE CAN SAY ALL HITS ARE NOT CREATED EQUAL NOT IN THE MIND OF THE AUDIENCE AND DEFINITELY NOT IN THE MIND OF THE RECORD INDUSTRY
POD1000000019_S0000012	I SHOULD GIVE A DISCLAIMER HERE THAT COMMERCIAL SUCCESS IS OBVIOUSLY NOT EVERYTHING OBVIOUSLY NOT A GAUGE OF ATISTIC MERIT
POD1000000019_S0000013	THERE ARE BRILLIANT COUNTRY ARTISTS WHO'VE NEVER HAD A HIT IN THEIR LIVES THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY
POD1000000019_S0000014	BUT IF WE'RE SAYING TOP TEN SINGLES ARE HITS AND I BELIEVE WE SHOULD SAY THAT THEN JUST HAVING HITS WASN'T ENOUGH FOR THIS INDUSTRY YOU HAD TO HAVE MORE HITS BIGGER HITS IT WAS CALLED THE RECORD INDUSTRY
POD1000000019_S0000015	MOVE UNITS MAKE MONEY OR GET OUT OF THE WAY FOR THE NEXT ARTIST WHO WILL ALWAYS BE SCALING UP ANYTHING THAT ISN'T AS GOOD AS OR BETTER THAN THE LAST THING YOU DID
POD1000000019_S0000016	YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE NOT DONE IT AND YOU'LL PROBABLY END UP WISHING YOU HADN'T
POD1000000019_S0000017	I THINK THE WORST THING THAT COULD HAPPEN TO A COUNTRY RECORDING ARTIST IN THIS CLIMATE IS FOR THEIR VERY FIRST SINGLE TO BECOME A NUMBER ONE HIT YOU CAN'T DO ANY BETTER THAN THAT THE ONLY WAY TO IMPROVE ON THAT IS TO STAY NUMBER ONE FOR MORE WEEKS
POD1000000019_S0000018	SELL MORE COPIES EVEN IF YOU MANAGE TO DO THAT IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME UNTIL YOU PUT OUT A SONG THAT ONLY GOES TO NUMBER TWO OR NUMBER FIVE
POD1000000019_S0000019	BUT THAT'S STILL A HIT OH SURE SURE IT IS OR MAYBE IT'S THE BEGINNING OF THE END MAYBE YOU JUST DON'T HAVE THE STUFF ANYMORE KIDO WE GOT TO GET THOSE NUMBERS BACK UP TO WHERE THEY WERE OR WELL IT AIN'T GONNA BE GOOD
POD1000000019_S0000020	IMAGINE YOU'RE A NEW COUNTRY ARTIST AND YOUR VERY FIRST SINGLE GO'S NUMBER ONE COUNTRY AND POP HOW SCREWED DO YOU THINK YOU ARE THERE AREN'T MANY PEOPLE YOU CAN ASK ABOUT THIS

POD1000000019_S0000025	BILLY SWAN NEVER EVEN GOT BACK IN THE TOP TEN ALTHOUGH HE DID ALSO WRITE HIS ONE HIT I CAN HELP AND ELVIS PRESLEY RECORDED THAT SO I ASSUME BILLY'S DOING FINE

POD1000000019_S0000051	JEANY C RILEY'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY IS REALLY THE ONLY SOURCE I CAN USE FOR THIS STUFF AND IT'S SUPER SKETCHY TO SAY THE LEAST
POD1000000019_S0000052	THIS IS THE FIRST OF SEVERAL OUTLANDISH SCENARIOS WHERE FAMOUS PEOPLE GIVE HER INCREDIBLY PERSONAL ADVICE THAT IS ALSO SO EXTREMELY SPECIFIC
POD1000000019_S0000053	IT'S ALMOST AS IF THEY CAN SEE INTO JENEY'S ACTUAL FUTURE MERE MOMENTS AFTER MEETING HER FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME

POD1000000019_S0000057	SHE IS BLATANTLY LYING ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS THERE'S EVEN A NOTE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK ABOUT HOW SEVERAL NAMES AND SOME DETAILS HAVE BEEN CHANGED TO PROTECT PEOPLE
POD1000000019_S0000059	BASICALLY IT COULD NOT BE MORE CLEAR THAT THIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY IS MORE LIKE WHAT YOU'D CALL AN AUTOHAGGEOGRAPHY THE HOLLYWOOD MOVIE VERSION OF THESE EVENTS
POD1000000019_S0000060	THEY MIGHT AS WELL HAVE PRINTED BASED ON A TRUE STORY ON THE TITLE PAGE I SHOULD SAY THIS IS ONE OF THOSE CELEBRITY AUTOBIOGRAPHIES THAT'S WRITTEN WITH THE HELP OF AN AUTHOR SO YOU KNOW IT'S POSSIBLE THIS GUY HAD A HAND IN THESE EMBELLISHMENTS

POD1000000019_S0000064	THE PROBLEM IS AS YOU'LL HEAR IN A FEW MINUTES THE ENTIRE WEEK BEFORE THIS JEANY HAD BEEN ARGUING WITH EVERYONE ABOUT NOT LIKING THIS SONG AND WHETHER OR NOT IT WOULD BE RELEASED UNDER HER OWN NAME OR A SEUDONYM
POD1000000019_S0000065	IN THE VERY NEXT PARAGRAPH SHE SAYS SHE'D ALREADY STUDIED THE LYRICS WHICH SHE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN FROM SHELBY WHY DOES SHE HAVE SHELBY PRESENTING THE LYRICS TO HER HERE WITH SUCH POMP AS IF FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME
POD1000000019_S0000066	AS IF SHE'S NEVER HEARD THIS SONG BEFORE LIKE I SAID SMALL THING I WOULD LET IT SLIDE BUT THIS IS A DEATH BY A THOUSAND CUT SITUATION
POD1000000019_S0000067	THERE'S AT LEAST ONE SCENE WHERE TWO PEOPLE GO BACK AND FORTH WITH LINES OF QUOTED DIALOGUE IN A CONVERSATION THAT JEANY WAS NOT THERE FOR AND COULD NOT POSSIBLY REMEMBER WITH SUCH DETAIL EVEN IF SHE WAS BLESSED WITH TOTAL RECALL OVER A DECADE AFTER THE FACT
POD1000000019_S0000069	THERE'S ONE MORE SCENE WHERE SHE'S DRIVING HER CAR WHILE UPSET QUOTE HALF BLIND FROM THE TEARS SHE ACCIDENTALLY SPEEDS OVER SOME RAILROAD TRACKS JUST AHEAD OF A CROSSING TRAIN AND I'M QUOTING HERE

POD1000000019_S0000088	AND THE NAMES OF THE COMPANIES THEY WORK FOR IT GETS REALLY CONFUSING TO WORK OUT THE SPECIFICS OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN AND WHERE FOR THE NEXT YEAR
POD1000000019_S0000089	FOR INSTANCE SHE REFERS TO HER FIRST MANAGER PAUL PERRY AS PETE TERRY THROUGH HER ENTIRE BOOK BECAUSE OF THE AFFAIRS SHE LATER HAS WITH HIM THIS OTHER GUY GETS NAMED PHIL BLACKMAN AND HE'S A BIG SHOT AT BLACK ROSE RECORDS
POD1000000019_S0000090	BASED OUT OF NEW YORK PHIL BLACKMAN IS OUR BIG BAD WOLF UNCLE JOHNNY BOUGHT A GAS STATION RIGHT BEFORE JENY AND MICKE MOVED TO NASHVILLE SO THAT'S WHERE MICKE STARTS WORKING

POD1000000019_S0000098	WHEN SHE GETS THERE MICKY'S TALKING TO A GUY NAMED JERRY CHESTNUT A RICH GUY WHO OWNS A VACUUM CLEANER BUSINESS BUT ALSO WANTS TO BE A SONGWRITER
POD1000000019_S0000099	YOU'VE HEARD THE SONG HE'D WRITE A FEW YEARS AFTER THIS CALLED A GOOD YEAR FOR THE ROSES
POD1000000019_S0000101	MICKY HAS A COPY OF GENE'S DEMOTAPE THAT HE PLAYS IN THE GAS STATION JUST IN CASE SOMEONE IMPORTANT HAPPENS TO COME IN AND HEAR IT AND CARE
POD1000000019_S0000102	CHESTNUT ISN'T REALLY IMPORTANT YET BUT HE DID STRIKE UP A CONVERSATION AND OFFER TO PLAY THE DEMOTAPE FOR HIS FRIENDS AT MONUMENT RECORDS A FEW DAYS LATER HE CALLS TO SAY MONUMENT IS INTERESTED
POD1000000019_S0000103	BUT THEY WANT TO CHANGE JENIE'S NAME BECAUSE THEY'RE ALREADY DOING WELL WITH JEANIE SEALI AND LET'S NOT GET CARRIED AWAY WITH THE GENIS OVER HERE RIGHT OUR GEANY'S NOT THRILLED ABOUT THIS
POD1000000019_S0000104	UJERRY THINKS THEY CAN GET MONUMENT TO BACK OFF THE NAME CHANGE IF THEY STAY ON IT JEANY GETS SHOWN OFF AT A DJ CONVENTION INTRODUCED TO EVERYONE IN TOWN AS TINA STEVENS THE NEXT GIRL THEY'RE GOING TO SIGN AND DO BIG THINGS WITH
POD1000000019_S0000105	BUT THEN SHE GETS FORGOTTEN ABOUT BECAUSE APPARENTLY A MAJOR FEMALE ARTIST ON THE LABEL DOESN'T LIKE JENY OR TINA OR WHOEVER BACK TO SQUARE ONE
POD1000000019_S0000106	JERRY CHESTNUT MEETS A RADIO DJY NAMED PAUL PERRY WHO KNOWS PHIL BLACKMAN A MADE UP NAME FOR A REAL IMPORTANT GUY AT BLACK ROSE WHICH IS ALSO A MADEUP NAME FOR A REAL RECORD LABEL
POD1000000019_S0000107	REMEMBER THIS SENTENCE THAT DJAY PAUL PERRY SENDS JEANY'S DEMO AND A PROMO PICTURE TO PHIL BLACKMAN IN NEW YORK CITY
POD1000000019_S0000108	BLACKMAN EXPRESSES INTEREST IN RECORDING JENY WHEN HE COMES TO NASHVILLE SOMETIME IN JANUARY IT ENDS UP BEING EARLY FEBRUARY OF NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN WHEN JENYE WALKS IN TO BLACK ROSEE'S OFFICE FOR THE FIRST TIME
POD1000000019_S0000109	SHE WRITES LITERALLY NOTHING ABOUT THE CONVERSATION ONLY THAT SHE FINDS PHIL BLACKMAN VERY ATTRACTIVE AND SHE LEAVES WITH A CONTRACT THAT NIGHT SHE BEGINS FANTASIZING THAT BLACKMAN WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH HER
POD1000000019_S0000110	ITHIN A WEEK IN REALITY THEY'VE KISSED BLACKMAN GOES BACK TO NEW YORK CITY FOR BUSINESS WHEN HE RETURNS A FEW WEEKS LATER HE AND JEANY START HAVING A FULL FLEDGED AFFAIR
POD1000000019_S0000111	NOW I DON'T LIKE DWELLING ON THIS SOAP OPERA STUFF UNLESS THE STORY CANNOT BE TOLD WITHOUT IT SO HERE'S THE RELEVANT INFORMATION THAT DJA NAMED PAUL PERRY BECOMES JEANIY'S FIRST MANAGER
POD1000000019_S0000112	SHE TECHNICALLY GETS A SINGLE RELEASED ON BLACK ROSE RECORDS BUT IT'S ONLY TECHNICALLY RELEASED NO MONEY IS PUT INTO PROMOTING IT AND NOT EVEN JEANY THINKS IT'S ANY GOOD
POD1000000019_S0000113	BUT SHE DOES THINK SHE AND THIS RICH POWERFUL MAN ARE IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER SO SHE'S NOT TOO WORRIED ABOUT THAT RECORD
POD1000000019_S0000115	THEN ONE DAY IN BLACKMAN'S APARTMENT JENY'S LYING NAKED ON THE COUCH AFTER HAVING SEX WITH HIM WHEN SHE'S SUDDENLY BLINDED BY FLASHES OF BRIGHT LIGHT THERE'S BLACKMAN HOLDING A CAMERA WITH A STROBE FLASH ATTACHMENT
POD1000000019_S0000116	JENY FREAKS OUT HE TELLS HER THERE'S NO FILM IN THE CAMERA SHE ASKS IF HE REALLY LOVES HER HE LAUGHS AT HER SAYS MEAN THINGS TO HER ABOUT HOW STUPID SHE IS AND SHE LEAVES CRYING

POD1000000019_S0000119	PHIL BLACKMAN IS ALSO IN LAS VEGAS BUT JENEY MANAGES TO RESIST HIS ADVANCES
POD1000000019_S0000120	FAST FORWARD AGAIN TO JANUARY OF NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT JEANY GETS BLACKMAN TO RELEASE HER FROM HER CONTRACT SO SHE CAN GO RECORD FOR LITTLE DARLIN RECORDS
POD1000000019_S0000121	THIS IS THE RECORD LABEL STARTED BY JOHNNY PAYCHECK AND HIS PRODUCER AUDREY MAHUE WHO HAD HEARD JENY SING IN VEGAS AND DECIDED HE'D LIKE TO RECORD HER
POD1000000019_S0000122	AUBREY DOES RECORD HER A SINGLE IS RELEASED ON LITTLE DARLIN BUT LIKE THE BLACK ROSE SINGLE WITH PHIL BLACKMAN IT'S ONLY TECHNICALLY RELEASED NOT REALLY PROMOTED BECAUSE THEY QOTE WOUND UP IN CONTRACT DIFFICULTIES
POD1000000019_S0000123	I WILL COME BACK TO THIS
POD1000000019_S0000125	MEANWHILE JERRY CHESTNUT HAS DECIDED TO GET OUT OF THE VACUUM CLEANER BUSINESS AND ALL THE WAY IN TO THE MUSIC BUSINESS OPENING UP A MUSIC ROW OFFICE FOR HIS PUBLISHING COMPANY
POD1000000019_S0000126	HE HIRES JEANY AS A SECRETARY WHICH IS WHERE SHE'S WORKING WHEN A SONGWRITER FRIEND ASK HER TO SING ON THE DEMO OF HIS NEW SONG HE WANTS SHELLBE SINGLETON AT PLANTATION RECORDS TO HEAR
POD1000000019_S0000127	I COULDN'T FIND A RECORDING OF JEANYE SINGING IT BUT I FOUND THE SONGWRITER SINGING IT HIMSELF SO YOU CAN TRY TO IMAGINE WHAT JEANY WOULD HAVE SOUNDED LIKE ON THE DEMO
POD1000000019_S0000128	CLARK BENTLY'S OLD TOWN DRUNK COMES OUT ON PLANTATION RECORDS IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT
POD1000000019_S0000130	WHEN SHELLBY HEARS THE DEMO HE'S MORE INTERESTED IN THE VOICE OF THE SINGER THAN THE SONG IF YOU LISTEN TO LAST WEEK'S EPISODE THIS IS THE PART WHERE HE WANTS TO MEET THAT SINGER TO SEE IF SHE'S GOT THE IMAGE HE'S LOOKING FOR TO SING HARPER VALLEY PTA
POD1000000019_S0000132	HERE ON JENY'S SIDE SHE WANTS TO LISTEN TO HARPER VALLEY PTA BEFORE SHE AGREES TO ANYTHING HER MANAGER PAUL PERRY THINKS SHE'S CRAZY FOR NOT GETTING ON BOARD SIGHT UNSEEN BUT HE BRINGS HER A TAPE SHE DOESN'T LIKE THE SONG
POD1000000019_S0000133	JUST DOESN'T LIKE SOMETHING ABOUT IT SAYS IT SOUNDS LIKE A SOFT REDO OF ODE TO BILLY JOE NOW PAUL PERRY AND ALL HER FRIENDS THINK SHE'S CRAZY SHE AGREES TO MEET WITH SHELLBY AND THERE'S SOMETHING SHE DOESN'T LIKE ABOUT HIM TOO
POD1000000019_S0000134	SHELLBY TELLS HER THEY CAN MAKE A POP HIT TOGETHER BUT THEY'LL HAVE TO CHANGE HER NAME BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MANY GENIS IN NASHVILLE SAME OLD STORY HE WANTS TO CALL HER RANDA RENE
POD1000000019_S0000135	SHE'S THINKING ABOUT THAT WHEN PERRY SAYS IF JENY DOESN'T TAKE THIS DEAL THEN HE CAN'T REPRESENT HER ANYMORE IT'S NOT GOING TO GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS SHE SIGNS THE PAPERS GOES HOME AND CRIES ABOUT IT
POD1000000019_S0000136	HER HUSBAND MICKY COMES HOME TO FIND HER UPSET HEARS THE STORY ABOUT THEM WANTING TO CHANGE HER NAME CALLS PAUL PERRY AND YELLS AT HIM TO TEAR UP THE CONTRACT JENE'S NOT DOING IT
POD1000000019_S0000137	THE NEXT DAY ALL THE BUSINESS PEOPLE CONVINCE HER THEY'LL LET HER KEEP HER OWN NAME IF SHE JUST COMES IN ON FRIDAY AFTER WORK TO RECORD THIS DAMN SONG THE ENTIRE DAY FRIDAY JENY'S PISSED OFF AT THE WORLD
POD1000000019_S0000138	SHE FEELS LIKE SHE'S BEING BACKED INTO A CORNER AND TALKED INTO DOING SOMETHING SHE DOESN'T WANT TO DO ON TOP OF THAT SHE'S SURE EVERYONE'S LYING TO HER ABOUT GETTING TO USE HER REAL NAME
POD1000000019_S0000139	STILL SHE GOES TO THE STUDIO CHANNELS HER ANGER INTO THE SONG AND NAILS IT ON THE SECOND TAPE
POD1000000019_S0000141	SHELLBY TELLS JENY THEY'LL USE HER MIDDLE INITIAL TO MAKE HER STAND OUT MORE FROM THE OTHER JENY'S AND ADD AN YE TO HER FIRST NAME SO PEOPLE KNOW IT'S NOT PRONOUNCED GEANE
POD1000000019_S0000142	FINDING OUT SHE REALLY DOESN'T HAVE TO BE RONDA RENE PLUS THE FACT THAT EVERYONE IN THE ROOM SEEMS CERTAIN SHE JUST CAUGHT A MASSIVE HIT SONG IMPROVES JENY'S MOOD
POD1000000019_S0000143	SHE CALLS HER MOTHER AT ONE IN THE MORNING TO TELL HER SHE JUST RECORDED A SONG THAT'S GOINNA BE THE NUMBER ONE SONG IN THE COUNTRY
POD1000000019_S0000144	THE MASTERS ARE MIXED AND SENT TO THE PRESSING PLANT ON SATURDAY MORNING JENY SPENDS MONDAY HANDWRITING HUNDREDS OF PERSONALIZED NOTES TO GO WITH PROMOCOPIES TO DJAS ALL OVER AMERICA
POD1000000019_S0000145	ANYTIME SHE COMES TO HER OWN NAME OR THE NAME OF THE SONG SHE SWITCHES FROM BLACK INK TO RED SO IT STANDS OUT ON THE PAGE A STATION IN OHIO PLAYS THE SINGLE TWENTY SIX TIMES IN ONE DAY OTHER STATIONS BAN IT BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE HER UPPETY TONE
POD1000000019_S0000146	LOVE IT OR HATE IT EVERYONE TALKS ABOUT IT ACCORDING TO JEANYE SHE AND MICKY TAKE A COPY OVER TO RALPH EMMERY AT WSM
POD1000000019_S0000147	THIS DOESN'T NECESSARILY CONFLICT WITH JERRY KENNEDY'S STORY ABOUT SHELBY TAKING OVER AN ACITATE THE NIGHT OF THE SESSION JEANY WOULD WANT RALPH TO HAVE A REAL COPY OF THE RECORD BUT THEN JEANYE SAYS RALPH TELLS MICKY YOU'LL BE REALLY CAREFUL
POD1000000019_S0000148	SO MANY FAMILIES BREAK UP AS SOON AS THE SINGER HITS THE BIG TIME

POD1000000019_S0000150	A REAL ONTOURAGE THEY STAY IN NICE HOTELS DRINK CHAMPAGNE ORDER ROOM SERVICE AND LEAVE HUGE TIPS AT DINNERS JENY DOESN'T REALIZE HOW ALL THIS WORKS UNTIL LATER

POD1000000019_S0000155	ANYWAY PRETTY SOON JEANYE STARTS SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME WITH HER MANAGER PAUL PERRY ONE NIGHT THEY'RE SITTING AROUND HOLDING HANDS AND PERRY'S TALKING ABOUT HOW CAREFUL JENY HAS TO BE NOW THAT SHE'S ON TOP
POD1000000019_S0000156	HE SURE HOPES SHE DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING IN HER PAST THAT COULD COME BACK TO HAUNT HER YOU KNOW LIKE NOODY PICTURES TAKEN BY PHIL BLACKMAN
POD1000000019_S0000158	BACK IN NASHVILLE FIRST THING MONDAY MORNING JEANY HEADS OVER TO BLACK ROSE RECORDS THERE'S BLACKMAN IN HIS OFFICE PACKING UP A STACK OF BRAND NEW JEANE C RILEY RECORDS
POD1000000019_S0000159	MADE FROM HER OLD SESSIONS WITH HIM NOW THAT JENY'S GOT THE BIGGEST HIT IN THE NATION THESE RECORDS WILL SELL
POD1000000019_S0000160	THEY ARGUE SHE DEMANDS THE NAKED PICTURES HE PLAYS STUPID AT FIRST BUT THEN SAYS IT'LL TAKE HIM A COUPLE DAYS TO GET THEM COME BACK WEDNESDAY SKIP TO WEDNESDAY
POD1000000019_S0000161	BLACKMAN'S GOT A MANILLA ENVELOPE LIKE YOU SEE IN EVERY MOVIE ABOUT A PRIVATE DETECTIVE AND HE WANTS TO GIVE IT TO JEANY BUT FIRST SHE'S GOT TO SIGN A NEW PIECE OF PAPER SAYING SHE WON'T SUE HIM FOR RELEASING HER OLD RECORDINGS
POD1000000019_S0000162	SEE HE'S LEGALLY ALLOWED TO DO THAT AND SHE'LL EVEN GET PAID ROYALTIES AND EVERYTHING IT'S JUST THAT HE LOST THEIR ORIGINAL CONTRACT SO SIGN HERE AND HERE AND YOU CAN HAVE THOSE PICTURES
POD1000000019_S0000163	OF COURSE SHE SIGNS THE THING THEN WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING IN THE MANILLA ENVELOPE SHE ASKS HIM TO BURN IT WHICH HE DOES IN FRONT OF HER BY THE TIME SHE GETS HOME
POD1000000019_S0000164	HALF AN HOUR LATER THE NEWS IS REPORTING THAT BLACK ROSE RECORDS HAS FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST HARPER VALLEY PTA' SINGER AND RECORD LABEL FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT
POD1000000019_S0000165	OKAY HERE'S THE THING PHIL BLACKMAN AND ADREY MAHUE ARE AT LEAST PARTIALLY THE SAME PERSON
POD1000000019_S0000166	YOU DO REMEMBER AUBREY RIGHT JOHNNY PAYCHECK'S PRODUCER THAT HEARD JEANYE SING IN VEGAS WANTED TO RECORD HER AND THAT'S WHY SHE GOT BLACKMAN TO LET HER OUT OF HER CONTRACT IN THE FIRST PLACE
POD1000000019_S0000167	YEAH THAT'S ALL BULLSHIT
POD1000000019_S0000168	PHIL BLACKMAN AND BLACKROSE RECORDS ARE NOT FAKE NAMES FOR SOMEONE AND SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED BEFORE JEANY GOT INVOLVED WITH AUDREY MAYHUE AND LITTLE DARLIN
POD1000000019_S0000169	ENY TELLS THE SAME STORY TWO DIFFERENT WAYS AS A RED HARRING BLACK RHOSE RECORDS IS LITTLE DARLIN RECORDS
POD1000000019_S0000170	WHICH IS ALSO THE EXPLANATION FOR WHY JEANY WOULD BE IN LAS VEGAS OPENING UP FOR JOHNNY PAYCHECK WHEN ALL SHE'S SUPPOSEDLY DONE IS ONE BARELY RELEASED SINGLE FOR BLACKROSE RECORDS
POD1000000019_S0000171	IF YOU WERE TO REWIND THIS EPISODE AND LISTEN TO THE PART ABOUT HOW PHIL BLACKMAN CAME INTO JEANY C RILEY'S LIFE YOU'D BE LISTENING TO THE STORY OF HOW AUDREY MAYHEUWE CAME INTO HER LIFE
POD1000000019_S0000172	YOU'D BE LISTENING TO THE STORY OF HOW JEANE C REILEY CAME TO BE SIGNED TO LITTLE DARLIN RECORDS
POD1000000019_S0000173	I KNOW THIS BECAUSE IT'S DESCRIBED EXACTLY THE SAME WAY IN COURT DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE LAWSUIT JENY JUST TOLD US ABOUT
POD1000000019_S0000174	QUOTE AS TO LITTLE DARLIN RECORDS THE AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL BILL ASSERTS THAT PRIOR TO THE TIME COMPLAINANT WAS INCORPORATED ITS PRESIDENT AUDRE MAHUE DID BUSINESS IN NEW YORK NEW YORK
POD1000000019_S0000175	AS AN INDIVIDUAL UNDER THE PROPRIETARY NAME OF LITTLE DARLIN RECORDS THAT HIS FIRST KNOWLEDGE OF DEFENDANT RILEY WAS A LETTER ADDRESSED TO HIM ON THE DATE OF DECEMBER EIGHT NINETEN SIXTY SIX BY PAUL PERRY
POD1000000019_S0000176	ENCLOSING THE TAPE AND PHOTO MENTIONED
POD1000000019_S0000177	THERE WAS NO BARELY RELEASED BLACK ROSE SINGLE BEFORE THE BARELY RELEASED LITTLE DARLIN SINGLE THERE WAS ONE BARELY RELEASED SINGLE
POD1000000019_S0000178	THE CONTRACT DIFFICULTIES JENIE MENTIONS TO EXPLAIN WHY HER LITTLE DARLIN SINGLE SUFFERED THE SAME FATE AS HER BLACK ROSE SINGLE THAT'S THIS LAWSUIT THE COURT DOCUMENT SHEDS MORE LIGHT ON THIS
POD1000000019_S0000179	IN RESPONSE TO MAHU'S LAWSUIT JEANY TELLS THE COURT THAT MAYHU WAS NEVER CONVINCED SHE HAD ENOUGH TALENT TO SUCCEED AS A RECORDING ARTIST
POD1000000019_S0000180	DID NOT UNDERTAKE TO PRODUCE ANY RECORDS OF HER VOICE FOR GENERAL DISTRIBUTION
POD1000000019_S0000181	IN OTHER WORDS AUBREY MAHU DIDN'T THINK JEANY WAS THAT GOOD OF A SINGER HE WAS USING HER AS LITTLE MORE THAN A SESSION VOCALIST FOR DEMO TAPES HE NEEDED DONE ANYWAY WHILE LETTING HER BELIEVE SHE WAS A REAL RECORDING ARTIST
POD1000000019_S0000182	JEANYE SEEMS TO THINK THAT ONE SINGLE WAS JUST HIM GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS TO STRING HER ALONG AND SHE'S PROBABLY RIGHT
POD1000000019_S0000183	SPEAKING VERY STRICTLY HARPER VALLEY PTA IS NOT HER DEBUTE SINGLE AS I SAID IT WAS IN THE INTRO OF THIS EPISODE BUT HER FIRST SINGLE MAY NEVER HAVE BEEN MEANT FOR AN AUDIENCE LARGER THAN HER IMMEDIATE CIRCLE OF FAMILY AND FRIENDS
POD1000000019_S0000184	SOMETHING PHYSICAL FOR JENY TO PLAY PRETEND WITH TO KEEP THE WHOLE CHARADE GOING IT WAS CALLED YOU WRITE THE MUSIC CREDITED TO GEAN RIHLEY QUOTE UNQUOTE RELEASED ON LITTLE DARLIN RECORDS IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN
POD1000000019_S0000186	AUBREY'S FIRST MISTAKE WAS SIGNING JENY TO A REAL RECORDING CONTRACT WHICH STIPULATED THAT SHE' BE RECORDED FOUR TIMES A YEAR A STIPULATION NOT MET BY USING HER FOR DEMO SESSIONS
POD1000000019_S0000187	HIS SECOND MISTAKE WAS RELEASING HER FROM HER CONTRACT ON APRIL THIRD OF NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT FOUR MONTHS BEFORE SHE RECORDED HARPER VALLEY PTA
POD1000000019_S0000188	NOW HERE ARE THE TWO BIG QUESTIONS I DON'T THINK I CAN OR SHOULD EVEN TRY TO ANSWER DID AUBEREY MAHU AND JEANEY C RIHLLY HAVE AN AFFAIR
POD1000000019_S0000189	AND DID ABREY MAHUGE TAKE NAKED PHOTOGRAPHS OF JENE C RILLEY WITHOUT HER CONSENT AND THEN BLACKMAIL HER
POD1000000019_S0000190	TECHNICALLY JEANY HAS NEVER ALLEGED EITHER OF THESE THINGS AGAINST ABEREY MAHUE
POD1000000019_S0000191	THAT WAS PHIL BLACKMAN I'M GOING TO PLAY IT SAFE AND POINT OUT THAT IT'S POSSIBLE PHIL BLACKMAN IS MEANT AS AN AMALGAMATION OF MORE THAN ONE PERSON
POD1000000019_S0000192	I'M NOT IN ANY WAY A PROFESSIONAL INVESTIGATOR ALL I DID WAS READ A BUNCH OF PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION AND MATCH IT TO WHAT JENY WROTE IN HER BOOK
POD1000000019_S0000193	AS FAR AS I CAN TELL I'M THE FIRST READER OF JENEY'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY WHO CARED ENOUGH TO TAKE THE TIME TO LOOK INTO THIS OR AT LEAST I'M THE FIRST ONE TO TALK ABOUT IT
POD1000000019_S0000194	SEARCHING JENY AND AUBRY'S NAMES TOGETHER ONLY BRINGS UP INFORMATION ABOUT THEM HAVING WORKED TOGETHER AND INFORMATION ABOUT THIS LAWSUIT BUT LISTEN EVEN IF PHIL BLACKMAN IS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT ABRY MAHUE
POD1000000019_S0000195	AND EVEN IF WE CHOOSE TO ONE HUNDRED PERCENT BELIEVE EVERYTHING JENY SAYS ABOUT HIM THAT STILL DOESN'T MEAN AUBEREY MAHU TOOK THOSE PICTURES JEANY SAYS SHE HAD HIM BURN THE ENVELOPE WITHOUT LOOKING INSIDE
POD1000000019_S0000196	SHE EVEN BRINGS UP THE POSSIBILITY HERSELF THAT THE ENVELOPE COULD HAVE BEEN EMPTY
POD1000000019_S0000197	IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ANY PORNOGRAPHIC PHOTOGRAPHS WERE MENTIONED IN THE COURTROOM AT ALL
POD1000000019_S0000198	THE CASE WAS RULED IN FAVOUR OF SHELLBY SINGLETON AND JENY C RILLY
POD1000000019_S0000199	ACK IN THE BUSINESS OF PROMOTING THEIR HIT SINGLE JEANY GETS SENT TO CHARM SCHOOL TO LEARN HOW TO WALK TALK AND ACT ON STAGE
POD1000000019_S0000200	THEN SHE'S SENT ON TOUR CONCERTS TALK SHOWS RADIO SHOWS LIVE TV APPEARANCES HER HOMETOWN NAMES A DAY IN APRIL JENY C RILY DAY AND THERE'S A BIG CEREMONY FOR THAT
POD1000000019_S0000201	SHE GETS TO PICK WILD MOUNTAIN BERRIES WITH GLENN CAMPBELL ON TV
POD1000000019_S0000203	SHE GETS TO LIVE HER DREAM OF PERFORMING ON THE GRAND OL OPERA
POD1000000019_S0000205	BUT THEN SHE GETS HER FIRST ROYALTY CHECK AND FINDS OUT HOW MUCH OF THE MONEY BEING SPENT IS HERS BASICALLY ALL OF IT SHE'S ALWAYS EXPECTED TO HANG OUT AND BE NICE TO INDUSTRY PEOPLE
POD1000000019_S0000206	ONE NIGHT THERE'S A SCENE WITH MICKY WHEN A RANDOM SUIT AT A PARTY IS TOO PERSISTENT IN TRYING TO GET JEANY TO DANCE WITH HIM MICKIY GRABS THE GUY'S WRIST AND TELLS HIM TO BACK OFF
POD1000000019_S0000207	LATER SHELLBY TELLS JEANEY THAT MICKUE NEEDS TO STAY HOME IF HE CAN'T CONTROL HIMSELF AND MICKE IS BANISHED FROM THE ROAD
POD1000000019_S0000208	IF YOU'RE STARTING TO GET THE IDEA THAT JENE'S ALWAYS THOUGHT OF AS LITTLE MORE THAN A PUPPET FOR THE PEOPLE BEHIND THE SCENES OF HER CAREER I WOULD SAY THAT SEEMS ACCURATE
POD1000000019_S0000210	NOW ASIDE FROM THE SONG ITSELF THE BIGGEST IMPACT JEANE C RILEY HAD ON COUNTRY MUSIC WITH HARPER VALLEY PT A WAS IN FASHION
POD1000000019_S0000212	IT SEEMS RIDICULOUS TODAY BUT IN THE LATE SIXTY S THAT LINE IN THE SONG ABOUT THE SINGLE MOTHER WEARING MINI SKIRTS THAT IN ITSELF WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE A LOT OF COUNTRY MUSIC FANS GASP AND TURN OFF THE RADIO
POD1000000019_S0000213	AND WHILE THE SONG IS ACTUALLY SUNG BY THE DAUGHTER CHARACTER WHO DOESN'T DRESS THAT WAY EVERY TIME YOU SEE JEANYE C RILLEY SHE LOOKS LIKE MRS JOHNSON
POD1000000019_S0000215	HER STYLE OR MORE ACCURATELY THE STYLE SHE WAS MADE TO WEAR WOULD BEST BE DESCRIBED AS MAUD LIKE NANCY SENATRA IN HER BOOTS ARE MADE FOR WALKING PHASE
POD1000000019_S0000216	WAY BEFORE ANY OTHER WOMEN IN COUNTRY MUSIC WERE DRESSING THAT WAY WE'RE TALKING MINY SKIRTS GOGO BOOTS AND IN OCTOBER OF NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT THE FIRST YEAR THE CMMA AWARDS WERE TELEVISED
POD1000000019_S0000217	A RIDICULOUS DRESS
POD1000000019_S0000219	THE RUFFLES START HALFWAY UP HER RIB CAGE AND POOF WAY OUT LIKE THEY WOULD TO MAKE A BELL SHAPE DOWN TO THE GROUND BUT THEN IT ALL JUST STOPS HALFWAY DOWN HER THIGHS SHOWING OFF LEGS AND HIGHHEEL COWGIRL BOOTS
POD1000000019_S0000221	AFTER SEEING THE DRESS BUT BEFORE THE SHOW SHE CALLED SHELBY SINGLETON TO YELL AT HIM IN THE MIDDLE OF HER TIRAD AFTER SHE TELLS HIM SHE'S NOT MISS HARPER VALLEY PTA
POD1000000019_S0000222	SHE'S AN ARTIST SHELLBY CUTS HER OFF TO SAY YOU'RE NOT AN ARTIST BABY YOU'RE A COMMODITY A MINNI SKIRTED SILVER BOOTED COMMODITY NOW BE THERE EARLY WE'VE GOT A SHOW TO REHEARSE
POD1000000019_S0000223	THAT'S ONE EXCHANGE THAT I DON'T DOUBT FOR A SECOND HAPPENED JUST LIKE THAT
POD1000000019_S0000225	THE REST OF JENIY'S BOOK IS ABOUT HER STRUGGLES WITH INFIDELITY AND CONVERSION TO RELIGION MORE PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE MYSTICAL PSYCHIC POWERS
POD1000000019_S0000226	LIKE AFTER A DIVORCE FROM MICKY A RANDOM SALES CLERK IN A DEPARTMENT STORE SOMEWHERE STOPS JENY TO SAY YOUR EX HUSBAND STILL LOVES YOU GOD WANTS YOU TO GO BACK TO HIM BULLSHIT LIKE THAT
POD1000000019_S0000227	SHE TELLS THE STORY OF THE FIRST TIME SHE TRIES POD HAVING AN INTENSELY SPIRITUAL VISION THAT SENDS HER INTO A FUGUE STATE FOR CLOSE TO TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND SOUNDS MORE LIKE AN AIAWASCA TRIP THAN ANY WEED I'VE EVER SMOKED
POD1000000019_S0000228	FROM THE NIGHTMARE SHE DESCRIBES YOU'D EXPECT THAT TO BE THE ONLY TIME SHE EVER TOKED UP BUT THIS VIDEO CLIP OF RALPH EMMERY INTERVIEWING HER SEEMS TO SUGGEST OTHERWISE
POD1000000019_S0000230	SO I WANT TO GET AWAY FROM HER AUTOBIOGRAPHY FOR THE REST OF THIS EPISODE AND TALK MORE ABOUT THE MUSIC JENY MADE AFTER HER HIT BECAUSE THAT LAST SENTENCE IS PRETTY TYPICAL OF THE WAY PEOPLE TALK ABOUT JEANYE C RILEY'S CAREER
POD1000000019_S0000231	REFERENCE TO HER HIT AS IF SHE HAD ONLY ONE A ONE HIT WONDER IF YOU WILL
POD1000000019_S0000233	WHILE IT'S TRUE SHE NEVER TOOK ANOTHER SONG TO NUMBER ONE ON BOTH POP AND COUNTRY CHARTS NOT MANY PEOPLE HAVE EVER DONE THAT
POD1000000019_S0000234	THE ONLY OTHER WOMAN TO DO THAT IN THE NINETEEN HUNDREDS IS DOLIE PARTON WITH NINE TO FIVE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE MAKING JEANY THE FIRST WOMAN TO EVER DO IT IF YOU DON'T COUNT THE FARCE WITH LITTLE DARLIN RECORDS
POD1000000019_S0000235	WHICH YOU SHOULD NOT SHE'S THE ONLY WOMAN TO DO IT WITH HER DEBUTE SINGLE IT'S SO UNFAIR TO JUDGE THE REST OF HER OUTPUT AGAINST THAT THAT'S LIKE MOCKING A ROOKE BASKETBALL PLAYER FOR ONLY BREAKING A WORLD RECORD ONE TIME
POD1000000019_S0000236	JENY'S FOLLOW UP SINGLE TO HARPER VALLEY PTA WAS CALLED THE GIRL MOST LIKELY
POD1000000019_S0000237	STICKING WITH THE FORMULA IT'S ANOTHER SONG ABOUT PREJUDICE IN A SMALL TOWN THIS TIME IT'S THE GIRL WHO EVERYONE THOUGHT WOULD BE THE FIRST ONE TO GET IN THAT SPECIAL KIND OF TROUBLE ONLY A TEENAGE GIRL CAN GET IN
POD1000000019_S0000238	ONLY TURNS OUT IT'S THE MISSGOODY TOOSHOS OF THE TOWN WHO GETS KNOCKED UP BY THE TOWN DOCTOR'S SON INSTEAD AND
POD1000000019_S0000240	IT WENT TO NUMBER SIX ON THE COUNTRY CHART AND NUMBER FIFTY FIVE ON THE BILLBOARD HOT ONE HUNDRED I WOULD CALL THAT A HIT SONG
POD1000000019_S0000242	AFTER THAT AUDREY MAHU PUT OUT AN ALBUM CONSISTING OF EVERYTHING HE HAD SUNG BY JENE DURING HER TIME WITH LITTLE DARLIN
POD1000000019_S0000244	THE ALBUM IS CALLED SOCK SOL I'M GUESSING IN REFERENCE TO THE LINE IN HARPER VALLEY PTA ABOUT HOW MRS JOHNSON SOCKED IT TO HIM
POD1000000019_S0000245	BUT THIS STUFF WAS ALL RECORDED BEFORE ANYONE THOUGHT OF JEANE C RILEY AS THE LOUDEST VOICE CALLING B S ON AMERICAN SOCIETY SO NONE OF THE SONGS FIT THAT ALBUM TITLE OR HER IMAGE
POD1000000019_S0000246	THE MATERIAL IS GOOD IT'S JUST IN THE SAME VEIN BEING MINED BY EVERY OTHER FEMALE VOICE IN COUNTRY MUSIC
POD1000000019_S0000248	THE PRICE I PAY TO STAY BARELY CRACKED THE COUNTRY TOP FORTY FROM THERE HER SINGLES WERE HIT OR MISS IF YOU JUDGE THEM BY COMMERCIAL RESULTS
POD1000000019_S0000249	BUT EVEN WHEN SHE RELEASED A LEGITIMATE HIT NOBODY SAW IT THAT WAY BECAUSE IT WASN'T ANOTHER HARPER VALLEY PTA
POD1000000019_S0000251	HER FIRST PROPER SINGLE RELEASED AFTER THAT LITTLE DARLIN COMPILATION OF BASICALLY DEMO RECORDINGS WAS THERE NEVER WAS A TIME
POD1000000019_S0000252	HERE'S HER DOING IT ON THE JOHNNY CASH SHOW
POD1000000019_S0000254	THAT SONG WAS A TOP FIVE COUNTRY HIT THAT ALSO CRACKED THE POP HOT ONE HUNDRED NOW LISTEN TO HOW GREAT THIS OTHER SINGLE IS FROM THE SAME ALBUM AS THAT SONG THE BACKSIDE OF DALLAS WASN'T A HIT BUT IT'S A DAMN GOOD SONG
POD1000000019_S0000256	UP UNTIL THE MID SEVENTY S THE QUALITY OF HER MUSIC REMAINED PRETTY CONSISTENT HERE'S HER NEXT TOP TEN COUNTRY GIRL
POD1000000019_S0000258	SHE WAS STARTING TO BRANCH AWAY FROM THE HARPER VALLEY PTA PROTOTYPE OF GETTING ON A MICROPHONE AND POINTING FINGERS A
POD1000000019_S0000259	OCIETY ALSO LETTING JENY MULTITRACK HER OWN HARMONY VOCALS WAS A GREAT WAY TO SHUT UP THE CRITICS WHO LIKED TO SAY SHE HAD NO RANGE AS A SINGER
POD1000000019_S0000260	AND OF COURSE MOST OF THESE CRITICS WERE POP WRITERS WHO WERE ONLY AWARE OF GENE C REILLY BECAUSE OF THE POP SUCCESS OF HARBAR VALLEY PTA AND WHOSE ONLY OTHER FRAME OF REFERENCE FOR COUNTRY MUSIC IN THE SIXTY S AND SEVENTY S WAS PROBABLY JOHNNY KASH
POD1000000019_S0000261	LIKE THE ELA TIMES POP CRITIC ROBERT HILBURN WHO REVIEWED A GNC RILEY CONCERT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE UNDER THE HEADLINE LITTLE TALENT
POD1000000019_S0000262	QUOT JEANE C RILEY HAS ALL THE CONFIDENCE IN THE WORLD BUT UNFORTUNATELY VERY LITTLE OF THE TALENT
POD1000000019_S0000263	FIRST OF ALL HER VOICE ISN'T ANY GOOD SECOND NEITHER IS HER MATERIAL THAT'S TWO STRIKES AGAINST HER AND AS SOON AS THE PUBLIC FORGETS HARPER VALLEY PTA THAT'S THREE STRIKES AND SHE'S OUT
POD1000000019_S0000264	NOW MAYBE THAT GUY WAS HAVING A BAD DAY OR SOMETHING BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL HE'S TALKING ABOUT HE'S WRONG ON EVERY SINGLE POINT FROM EVERYTHING I'VE SEEN JENE C RILLY WAS EVEN BETTER LIVE THAN ON RECORDING
POD1000000019_S0000266	CHECK OUT THIS PERFORMANCE OF A SONG YOU HEARD JUST A LITTLE BIT AGO BACKSIDE OF DALLAS
POD1000000019_S0000268	SHE ALWAYS HAD A CRACK BAND BEHIND HER THE HARPER VALLEY EXPRESS THEY USUALLY MADE THE TEMPO OF EVERYTHING FASTER TO REALLY PUT SOME GAS IN THE TANK AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO DENY JENY'S CHARISMA AS A PERFORMER
POD1000000019_S0000270	THE SONG SHE'S SINGING IS ABOUT A WOMAN BECOMING A PROSTITUTE AND HER EXPRESSIONS ALTERNATE BETWEEN SASSY AND SERIOUS IN A WAY THAT KEEPS SHIFTING THE MEANING OF THE LYRICS
POD1000000019_S0000272	THOSE CHARM SCHOOL CLASSES PAID OFF SHE KNEW HOW TO WORK A CROWD STRIKING POSES AND FLASHING TWENTY DIFFERENT KINDS OF SMILE IN ALL THE RIGHT PLACES
POD1000000019_S0000273	BUT THAT LA TIMES REVIEW OF HER CONCERT IS THE SORT OF DISMISSIVE ATTITUDE THE POP INTELLIGENSIA HAD TOWARDS SOUTHERN CULTURE
POD1000000019_S0000274	NOT ONLY WAS JEANY NOT A ONE HIT WONDER SHE MADE GOOD ALBUMS WITH VERY LITTLE FILLER CHECK OUT THIS ALBUM TRACK FROM NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO NEVER EVEN RELEASED AS A SINGLE CALLED WITHOUT YOU
POD1000000019_S0000276	HER VOICE IS ON THE MELODY IS THERE WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT FROM A COUNTRY LOVE SONG THIS IS THE KIND OF TRACK YOU HOPE IS WAITING TO SURPRISE YOU WHEN YOU BUY SOMEONE'S ALBUM BASED ON ONE OR TWO OF THE SINGLES
POD1000000019_S0000277	WITHOUT YOU IS FROM JENY'S SECOND ALBUM ON MGM AFTER LEAVING PLANTATION RECORDS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO IN WHAT SHELBEY SINGLETON CALLED A BREACH OF CONTRACT
POD1000000019_S0000278	JENY'S LUCK IN THE COURTROOM HELD WINNING THIS CASE AS WELL THOUGH SHE MAINTAINED FOR THE REST OF HER CAREER THAT SHE WAS NEVER PAID WHAT SHE BELIEVED SHE WAS OWED FOR HARPER VALLEY PTA'S EARNINGS
POD1000000019_S0000280	HER FULL COMMITMENT TO CHRISTIANITY SEEMS TO HAVE TAKEN PLACE SOMETIME IN THE SEVENTY S
POD1000000019_S0000281	AND SEEMS TO HAVE CAUSED AT LEAST SOME REGRET FOR HER PREVIOUS PERSONA AS COUNTRY MUSIC'S MOST BLATANT SEX SYMBOL TO DATE THE CLOTHING CHANGED THE MUSIC TOOK A TURN TO GOSPEL AND
POD1000000019_S0000282	THIS IS PURELY SPECULATION ON MY PART BUT IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE MONEY COULD HAVE REALLY BECOME A PROBLEM FOR HER IN THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY S
POD1000000019_S0000283	THAT AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF HERS WAS PUBLISHED IN THE YEAR NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE SHORTLY BEFORE THE RELEASE OF A GOSPEL ALBUM WITH THE SAME TITLE AS THE BOOK
POD1000000019_S0000284	GENERALLY SPEAKING WHEN A MUSICAL ARTIST QUOTE UNQUOTE PAST THEIR PRIME PUTS OUT AN ALBUM RIGHT AFTER THEY PUT OUT A BOOK
POD1000000019_S0000285	IT'S SAFE TO ASSUME THAT BOOK IS MEANT TO GENERATE NEW INTEREST IN THAT ARTIST' MUSIC IN ADVANCE OF THE NEW ALBUM
POD1000000019_S0000287	IN OTHER WORDS IT'S OFTEN A PROMOTIONAL STRATEGY IF THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED HERE THEN THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THIS BOOK WAS PRINTED BY A SMALL PUBLISHER OF CHRISTIAN BOOKS
POD1000000019_S0000289	IT MAY NOT BE SAFE TO ASSUME THAT NO MAJOR PUBLISHERS WERE INTERESTED AND THAT'S WHY JENY WENT WITH THE SMALL CHRISTIAN PUBLISHER
POD1000000019_S0000290	HOWEVER IT DOES SEEM VERY SAFE TO ASSUME THAT THIS SMALL CHRISTIAN PUBLISHING HOUSE WOULD MOSTLY IF NOT EXCLUSIVELY HAVE A PROMOTIONAL NETWORK MEANT TO GET THEIR PRODUCT IN FRONT OF CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIANS
POD1000000019_S0000291	AKA THE EXACT OPPOSITE AUDIENCE OF THE ONLY REASON ANYONE KNOWS JEANY C RILEY'S NAME HARPER VALLEY PT A A SONG HIGHLY CRITICAL OF HYPOCRISY IN SOCIAL GROUPS WITH HARD CORE CONSERVATIVE VALUES
POD1000000019_S0000293	EVEN THE MUSIC FANS WHO DID FIND THE BOOK WOULDN'T BE LIKELY TO RECOMMEND IT TO A FRIEND BECAUSE OF HOW POORLY IT IS WRITTEN AND HOW MOST OF IT IS IRRELEVANT TO HER CAREER IN MUSIC
POD1000000019_S0000295	PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT THE BOOK BECAUSE THEY HAPPENED TO SEE IT ON ONE OF THEIR REGULAR TRIPS TO THE CHRISTIAN BOOK STORE WOULD NO DOUBT BE SCANDALIZED BY JEANY'S RAMPANT INFIDELITY AND THE POT SMOKING
POD1000000019_S0000297	THE USED COPY THAT I HAVE ONCE BELONGED TO A LIBRARY IN NEW MEXICO IT STILL HAS THE STAMP CARD IN THE BACK I CAN SEE HERE THAT ONLY FOUR PEOPLE CHECKED IT OUT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE
POD1000000019_S0000298	THE YEAR IT WAS PUBLISHED ONE PERSON IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO NOBODY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE AND ONE OR TWO READERS A YEAR AT BEST FROM THERE IT WAS DISCARDED IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE
POD1000000019_S0000299	HAVING BEEN CHECKED OUT A GRAND TOTAL OF THIRTEEN TIMES NOT GOOD ESPECIALLY IF THAT WAS THE MAIN PLAN TO GET PEOPLE HYPED FOR THAT NEW GOSPEL ALBUM
POD1000000019_S0000300	WHICH ENTIRELY FAILED TO CHART IF SHE HAD HOPES OF GETTING OFF THE ROAD WHERE SHE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN MAKING MOST OF HER INCOME FROM HARPER VALLEY TO THE MOUNTAINTOP AS A BOOK ALBUM COMBO DID NOT DELIVER
POD1000000019_S0000301	NEXT MOVE ASK TOM T HALL TO WRITE ANOTHER HARPER VALLEY PTA A THING HE'D BEEN VERY VOCAL ABOUT HIS RELUCTANCE TO DO BUT ALSO HE'S A BIG SOFTY
POD1000000019_S0000302	IT'S EASY TO IMAGINE HIM HAVING A HARD TIME SAYING NO WHEN JENY CAME TO HIM ABOUT IT IN NINETEN EIGHTY FOUR TOM WROTE RETURN TO HARPER VALLEY FOR HER HE EVEN MADE ALL THE LYRICS FIT JENYE'S NEW CHRISTIAN LIFESTYLE
POD1000000019_S0000304	WE'RE BACK AT HARPER VALLEY HIGH BECAUSE OUR NARRATOR'S GRANDCHILDREN GO TO THE SCHOOL NOW AND SHE'S BOUGHT A TICKET TO THE RAFFELE AUT OF SCHOOL DANCE SHE'S WEARING A DRESS THAT'S WELL BELOW HER KNEES
POD1000000019_S0000305	BECAUSE JUST ABOUT EVERY CHARACTER FROM THE ORIGINAL SONG IS NOW ON THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW
POD1000000019_S0000307	UT WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT SHE SPOTS A MAN GIVING A CIGARETTE TO A SCHOOL KID AND IT TURNS OUT HE'S SELLING DRUGS IN THE PARKING LOT THERE'S THE DRUMMER OF THE BAND DOING COCAINE AND THESE KIDS ARE ALL GETTING DRUNK AND TAKING PILLS AND TAKING OFF THEIR CLOTHES
POD1000000019_S0000308	SHE THINKS ABOUT GOING HOME FOR HER GUN BUT INSTEAD DECIDES TO GO HOME PRAY WITH HER BIBLE AND YOU GUESSED IT BRING ALL THIS UP AT THE NEXT MEETING OF THE HARPER VALLEY PTA
POD1000000019_S0000309	IN SHORT THE SONG IS TERRIBLE NOBODY CARED AT ALL
POD1000000019_S0000310	EVEN WITH TOM JOINING JENY FOR PROMO APPEARANCES ON ALL THE USUAL TV SHOWS LIKE NASHVILLE NOW TOM
POD1000000019_S0000313	AS YOU HEARD THERE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A SENSE OF URGENCY IN THE WRITING RECORDING AND RELEASE OF THIS SONG WHATEVER THE REASON FOR THE RUSH AND EVEN IF FANS OF THE ORIGINAL SONG HAD GROWN TO DEVELOP MORE CONSERVATIVE VALUES
POD1000000019_S0000314	THERE SIMPLY WASN'T ENOUGH INTEREST IN THIS RETURN TO GENERATE AIRPLAY OR SALES FIGURES
POD1000000019_S0000316	SEVEN YEARS LATER IN NINETEN NINETY ONE JEANY PUT OUT WHAT LOOKS LIKE WILL BE HER FINAL FORMALLY RELEASED SINGLE HERE'S TO THE COWBOYS
POD1000000019_S0000318	THE ENTIRE REVIEW IN BILLBOARD IS ONE SENTENCE RILEY GIVES A POIGNANT READING OF THIS TRIBUTE TO COWBOYS WHO ARE COMMITTED ENOUGH TO BE DOMESTICATED
POD1000000019_S0000320	AS SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE SEEN ON FOX NEWS IN TWO THOUSAND TWO SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE SHE APPARENTLY FORGOT THAT SHE WORKED WITH THE GUY WHO WAS PROBABLY RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING THE ELVIS IS STILL ALIVE RUMORS

POD1000000019_S0000338	YEAH AENJOY
POD1000000019_S0000339	AL RIGHT HERE ARE THE LINER NOTES FOR JEANY C RIHLEY
POD1000000019_S0000340	I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS IN FOR WHEN I BEGAN THIS EPISODE AND I'LL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THAT I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE TRUTH IS HERE
POD1000000019_S0000341	JUST WOW
POD1000000019_S0000342	I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I'M REALLY ALLOWED TO SAY RIGHT NOW BUT I GUESS IF I'M GOING TA GET IN TROUBLE FOR THIS THEN I PROBABLY ALREADY CROSSED THAT LINE SO
POD1000000019_S0000343	I KNOW THERE ARE LIES IN THIS EPISODE BECAUSE I TOLD YOU WHICH ONES I FOUND OUT ABOUT BUT I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT ELSE IS OR ISN'T A LIE
POD1000000019_S0000344	ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT I DID NOT KNOWINGLY PERPETUATE A LIE WHEN I'M READING A BOOK I PRETTY MUCH ALWAYS SAVE THE PREFACE AND FORWARD STUFF UNTIL AFTER I'VE READ THE BOOK
POD1000000019_S0000345	BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW TIMES READING SOME CLASSIC NOVEL OR SOMETHING WHERE THE PERSON WRITING THE FOREWORD SOME SCHOLAR OR SOMEONE ASSUMES EVERYONE MUST HAVE ALREADY READ THIS BOOK BEFORE
POD1000000019_S0000346	AND THEY DROP MAJOR SPOILERS RIGHT THERE BEFORE YOU'VE EVEN READ THE FIRST PAGE SO OUT OF HABIT I JUST NEVER READ THAT STUFF IN THE BEGINNING OF A BOOK IF THE BOOK'S GOOD I'LL USUALLY GO BACK AND READ IT OR IF I'M JUST LIKE WHAT THE HELL DID I JUST READ THEN I'LL GO BACK AND READ IT
POD1000000019_S0000347	AND THAT THAT SECOND SCENARIO WAS VERY MUCH THE CASE WITH JEANY C RILEY'S BOOK BY THE SECOND PAGE OF THE BOOK WHEN SHE WAS PUTTING THOSE WORDS IN SHELVY SINGLTON'S MOUTH AND IT JUST DIDN'T SEEM LIKE THE WAY HE TALKED TO ME
POD1000000019_S0000348	I DIDN'T MAKE SENSE THE WAY THAT SHE WAS HAVING HIM ACT BASED ON OTHER INFORMATION SHE WAS GIVING YOU AT THE SAME TIME I HAD A FEELING SOMETHING WAS UP
POD1000000019_S0000349	THEN A LITTLE BIT LATER SHE'S WRITING ABOUT HAVING JUST MARRIED MICKY WHILE SHE'S STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL I'LL JUST READ IT TO YOU OUT OF THE BOOK THIS IS A QUOTE
POD1000000019_S0000350	MICKY AND I MOVED INTO A SMALL APARTMENT AND STRUGGLED EACH MONTH TO MAKE IT ON HIS SALARY WE POSTPONED GOING TO NASHVILLE UNTIL I GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL AND WE COULD SAVE SOME MONEY
POD1000000019_S0000351	I WAS AT THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE FOR A CHECKUP WHEN HE TOLD ME HE THOUGHT I WAS PREGNANT IN ANOTHER MONTH WE'LL KNOW FOR SURE HE SAID OKY AND THE QUOTE
POD1000000019_S0000352	I DIDN'T SKIP OVER ANYTHING THERE AT ALL SHE WRITES A SENTENCE ABOUT WAITING TO MOVE TO NASHVILLE UNTIL SHE GRADUATES HIGH SCHOOL THEN THE VERY NEXT SENTENCE IS ABOUT HER FINDING OUT SHE'S PREGNANT
POD1000000019_S0000353	THERE'S A FOUR YEAR GAP BETWEEN THOSE TWO SENTENCES I STILL HAVE NO IDEA WHY THAT GAP IS THERE BUT THAT'S WHEN I KNEW I WAS READING SOME BULLSHIT
POD1000000019_S0000354	SO AFTER FINISHING THE BOOK I WENT BACK TO READ THES STUFF AT THE BEGINNING AND I FOUND THAT DISCLAIMER ABOUT THE FACTS BEING ALTERED
POD1000000019_S0000355	AND THAT DISCLAIMER IS WRITTEN BY JENIY'S CO AUTHOR WHO I ALSO FAILED TO MENTION IS A PREACHER HERE'S WHAT HE WRITES QUOTE TO KEEP FROM HURTING SOME OF THE FOLKS JEANI LOVES WE HAVE CHANGED THE NAMES OF SEVERAL PEOPLE IN THE BOOK
POD1000000019_S0000356	IN ONE INSTANCE WE ALSO CHANGED THE DETAILS SLIGHTLY TO PURPOSEFULLY DISGUISE A SCENE
POD1000000019_S0000357	ONLY THOSE WHO WERE INVOLVED WILL RECOGNIZE WHAT WE HAVE DONE BUT ALL THE REST IS TRUE JUST AS IT HAPPENED WHEN GOD PICKED UP THE HARPER VALLEY GIRL AND SET HER ON A MOUNTAIN TOP
POD1000000019_S0000358	OK EVEN THAT DISCLAIMER IS SO ENTIRELY BIZARRE THE WHOLE THING MAKES ME WONDER IF THIS GUY IS EVEN TALKING ABOUT INVENTING THE CHARACTER OF PHIL BLACKMAN
POD1000000019_S0000359	FIRST OF ALL THEY CHANGED THE NAMES TO PROTECT PEOPLE JENE LOVES JEANI LOVES THE PERSON WHO BLACKMAILED HER WITH REVENGE PORN OKA NEXT IN ONE INSTANCE WE HAVE CHANGED THE DETAILS SLIGHTLY TO DISGUISE A SEN
POD1000000019_S0000360	THAT IS NOT AT ALL AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF PHIL BLACKMAN'S EXISTENCE IN THIS BOOK THERE ARE MANY SCENES THAT HAD A LOT MORE THAN SLIGHT DETAILS CHANGED
POD1000000019_S0000361	SEVERAL THAT HAD TO HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY FABRICATED ANYWHERE IN THE BOOK SHE TALKS ABOUT THE FIRST BLACK ROSE SINGLE IS A LIE TALKING ABOUT MEETING AUDREY MEHUE IN LAS VEGAS
POD1000000019_S0000362	IS A LIE TALKING ABOUT GETTING OUT OF A CONTRACT WITH PHIL BLACKMAN TO RECORD WITH AUBRE MAYHUE
POD1000000019_S0000363	IS A LIE IT WOULD TAKE ME TEN MINUTES TO LIST EVERYTHING THAT IS FOR SURE A LIE AND IT WOULD PROBABLY TAKE ME HALF AN HOUR TO LIST EVERYTHING I SUSPECT IS A LIE IN THIS BOOK
POD1000000019_S0000364	THEN STILL WITH THIS DISCLAIMER THE PART AT THE END WHERE HE WRITES QUOTE BUT ALL THE REST IS TRUE END QUOTE HE WASN'T THERE WHEN ALL OF THIS STUFF HAPPENED SO ALL THAT MEANS IS THIS IS WHAT SHE TOLD ME HAPPENED
POD1000000019_S0000365	AND THAT REALLY MAKES ME WONDER IF JEANEY CAME UP WITH THIS WHOLE PHIL BLACKMAN STORY LINE ON HER OWN AND TRIED TO SELL IT TO THIS GUY AS FACT
POD1000000019_S0000366	MAYBE HE FIGURED OUT SHE WAS LYING SO THIS DISCLAIMER IS HIS WAY OF COVERING HIS OWN ASS IN CASE I DON'T KNOW AUDEREY MAYHUE DECIDED TO SU THE SHIT OUT OF HIM
POD1000000019_S0000367	THIS IS ALL OBVIOUSLY WILD SPECULATION ON MY PART BUT AT THIS POINT I'M NOT SURE WHAT OTHER RESPONSE I COULD POSSIBLY HAVE TO THIS PILE OF NONSENSE THE ATTEMPT AT DISGUISING THE TRUTH IS SO CLUMSY THAT IT EVEN PRESENTS ANOTHER POSSIBILITY
POD1000000019_S0000368	WHICH IS THAT THEY WANTED PEOPLE TO FIGURE OUT THE TRUTH AND HAVE IT BLOW UP INTO THIS BIG CONTROVERSY TO SELL THE BOOK THAT CERTAINLY SOUNDS LIKE A BUSINESS STRATEGY SOMEONE MIGHT PICK UP FROM SAY WORKING WITH SHELLBY SINGLETON
POD1000000019_S0000369	THE ONLY PROBLEM BEING THAT HARDLY ANYONE READ THIS STUPID BOOK IN THE FIRST PLACE SO THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN THERE'S SO MUCH OTHER STUFF IN THAT AUTOBIOGRAPHY THAT I DIDN'T EVEN GET INTO
POD1000000019_S0000370	DEFINITELY DO BUY THIS BOOK IF YOU WANT TO SEE A WORST CASE EXAMPLE OF A COUNTRY' SINGER AUTOBIOGRAPHY

POD1000000019_S0000374	ONE THING THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING THAT WE HEARD TODAY IS UNLIKE AS YOU HEARD IN THE SECOND EPISODE F THE PODCAST LAURETTA LYND'S RECORDING OF THE PILL
POD1000000019_S0000375	THE MUSIC ESTABLISHMENT IN NASHVILLE AND EVERYWHERE ELSE MOSTLY JUST GOT ON BOARD WITH THIS SONG RIGHT AWAY TEX RITTER DID SAY THAT THE SONG SOUNDED DIRTY AND SUGGESTIVE AND SOME RADIO STATIONS DID BAN IT BUT WHO CARES
POD1000000019_S0000376	I LET YOU HEAR IT FROM INDUSTRY GIANTS YOU HEARD JOHNNY CASH SAY IT WON A GRAMMY AWARD YOU HEARD ROGER MILLER ANNOUNCE IT AS THE CMA SINGLE OF THE YEAR
POD1000000019_S0000377	SURE THE LYRICS AREN'T SCANDALOUS AT ALL COMPARED TO THE PILL BUT WHY DO YOU THINK THESE TWO SONGS WERE RECEIVED SO DIFFERENTLY BY THE OLD GUARD I KNOW WHAT I THINK
POD1000000019_S0000378	I THINK MONEY TALKS I THINK THAT BY THE TIME ANY OF THOSE WOULD BE BUZZKILLS STARTED PAYING ATTENTION THIS SONG WAS ALREADY THE NUMBER ONE POP SONG IN AMERICA AND IT WENT NUMBER ONE POP BEFORE IT WENT NUMBER ONE COUNTRY
POD1000000019_S0000379	EVERY MAJOR RECORD LABEL IN NASHVILLE HAD BEEN FALLING ALL OVER ITSELF FOR FIFTEEN YEARS TRYING TO DO THAT THEY'D HAVE MADE JEANE C RILY THE MAYOR OF NASHVILLE IF SHE DID IT A SECOND TIME
POD1000000019_S0000380	HER SECOND SINGLE DIDN'T GET THERE BUT THEY LET HER HANG AROUND A WHILE TO SEE IF IT HAPPENED AGAIN IT DIDN'T AND THIS IS THE STORY WE END UP WITH
POD1000000019_S0000381	BY THE WAY I COULD ALSO GET INTO A WHOLE OTHER RAMBLE ABOUT NATURE VERSUS NURTURE HERE YOU KNOW IS JENE C RILLEY QUOTE UNQUOTE THE WAY THAT SHE IS NOW
POD1000000019_S0000382	BECAUSE OF EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED TO HER OR WAS SHE ALWAYS LIKE THAT I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW AFTER RECORDING THIS EPISODE I WAS CHECKING ONE MORE THING AND I FOUND A PEOPLE MAGAZINE INTERVIEW FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE
POD1000000019_S0000383	THAT SAYS JENY WAS BROKE BY THE MID SEVENTIS SO I WAS A LITTLE LATE ON MY GUESS WHEN I SAID IT LOOKED LIKE MONEY PROBLEMS WERE THERE IN THE EARLY EIGHTY S BUT I WAS RIGHT

POD1000000019_S0000385	QUOTE SHE'S A LITTLE CRAZY BUT SHE'S JUST A GOOD OLD COUNTRY GIRL REALLY END QUOTE ALSO AFTER RECORDING THIS EPISODE I FOUND OUT THAT JENE C RILLEY MISQUOTED THE L A TIMES CRITIC ROBERT HILBURN IN HER BOOK
POD1000000019_S0000386	BECAUSE OF COURSE SHE DID ALSO THE REVIEW WAS FROM NINETEEN SIXTY NINE SO IT MAKES SO MUCH MORE SENSE KNOWING THAT IT CAME FROM THAT TIME
POD1000000019_S0000387	THEN TWO YEARS LATER IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE AS JEANY STATED IN THE BOOK THIS IS REALLY AGGRAVATING FOR ME TO HAVE TO TALK ABOUT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THIS IS JUST MY FAULT

POD1000000021_S0000032	THAT'S MARK MORIAL HE WORKED WITH EDWARDS AS A STATE LEGISLATOR AND AS THE MAYOR OF NEW ORLEANS
POD1000000021_S0000033	IN LOUISIANA IF YOU CAN PUT THOSE TWO VOTING BASES TOGETHER IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS AN UNBEATABLE COALITION
POD1000000021_S0000034	UNLIKE MOST OF HIS WHITE DEMOCRATIC PEERS EDWARDS WAS AN UNABASHED CIVIL RIGHTS CHAMPION
POD1000000021_S0000035	HE INVITED BLACK LOUISIANANS TO WORK IN GOVERNMENT POSITIONS AND HELPED CRAFT A STATE CONSTITUTION THAT OUTLAWED DISCRIMINATION

POD1000000021_S0000041	THE MIASMA OF CORRUPTION AND SCANDAL THAT HUNG OVER HIS ADMINISTRATION DIDN'T DAMAGE HIM EITHER
POD1000000021_S0000042	THERE WERE SIX GRAND JURY INVESTIGATIONS DURING EDWARDS'S FIRST TERM
POD1000000021_S0000043	BUT HE WASN'T INDICTED IN ANY OF THOSE CASES

POD1000000021_S0000046	EDWARDS LED LOUISIANA FOR EIGHT YEARS LEAVING OFFICE IN MARCH NINETEN EIGHTY
POD1000000021_S0000047	THE ONLY THING STOPPING HIM FROM BEING GOVERNOR FOR LIFE WERE TERM LIMITS THAT EDWARDS HIMSELF HAD PUSHED FOR
POD1000000021_S0000048	SO HE WENT ON A BRIEF HIATIS SETTING OUT THE NEXT ELECTION CYCLE THEN RETURNING IN NINETEE EIGHTY THREE TO RECLAIM HIS THRONE
POD1000000021_S0000049	IN THE LAST DAYS OF THAT CAMPAIGN EDWARDS FIRED OFF HIS MOST FAMOUS ONE LINER

POD1000000021_S0000069	AND SHE GAVE HIM WHAT SHE DESCRIBED AS A FRENCH KISS WHICH WAS ACTUALLY COURSE MORE LIKE A NUN'S KISS
POD1000000021_S0000070	UT SHE COULD TAKE A JOKE AND SO HE SAID OKAY SISTER BUT JUST DON'T LET ME GET INTO THE HABIT
POD1000000021_S0000071	AND ALL OF HIS SUPPORTERS GATHERED AROUND CHEERED AND BEAMED
POD1000000021_S0000072	ANDTHAT'S THE KIND OF THING THEY HAD COME TO PARIS FOR
POD1000000021_S0000073	THE PARTY ENDED FOR EDWIN EDWARDS AS SOON AS THOSE JUMBO JETS LANDED BACK IN LOUISIANA
POD1000000021_S0000074	THE CAMPAIGN OF EIGHTY THREE WAS GREAT IT WAS ONE OF THE FUNNEST EXPERIENCES OF MY LIFE

POD1000000021_S0000079	EDWARDS TRIED TO FILL THAT HOLE WITH TAX INCREASES
POD1000000021_S0000080	HIS CONSTITUENTS DIDN'T FIND THAT RAKISH OR CHARMING
POD1000000021_S0000081	YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO RAISE TAXES ON PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY STRUGGLING ALREADY IT'S A VERY PRECARIOUS POLITICAL SITUATION TO BE IN
POD1000000021_S0000082	SO THIS TAX PACKAGE WAS PROBABLY THE BEGINNING OF HIS UNPOPULARITY
POD1000000021_S0000083	IN FEBRUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE EDWIN EDWARDS'S RUN OF BAD LUCK
POD1000000021_S0000084	GOT A WHOLE LOT WORSE

POD1000000021_S0000091	AND RETURNING THOSE PHONE CALLS AND EXPLAINING TO PEOPLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR CAN'T TALK TO YOU RIGHT THIS MINUTE
POD1000000021_S0000092	AND WE TRIED TO BE AS DIPLOMATIC ABOUT IT AS WE COULD
POD1000000021_S0000093	AND OF COURSE MOST PEOPLE KNEW WHERE HE WAS AND WHAT HE WAS GOING THROUGH BUT THEY CALLED ANYWAY
POD1000000021_S0000094	THE CASE ENDED IN A MISTRIAL EDWARDS WAS LATER RETRIED AND FOUND NOT GUILTY
POD1000000021_S0000095	WHEN THAT VERDICT CAME IN THE PROSECUTOR SAID IF WE DIDN'T MAKE HIM HONEST I HOPE WE MADE HIM SORRY
POD1000000021_S0000096	WHEN I ASKED EDWARDS ABOUT THE CASE HE DIDN'T SOUND ALL THAT SORRY
POD1000000021_S0000097	THAT WAS AN EXAMPLE OF OF A OF A STUPID PROSECUTOR WHO DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING
POD1000000021_S0000098	DID IT BOTHER HIM WHEN PEOPLE SAID HE WAS PROFITING FROM HIS ROLE AS THE GOVERNOR
POD1000000021_S0000099	DID IT BOTHER YOU WHEN PEOPLE SAID YOU WERE PROFITING FROM YOUR ROLE AS GOVERNOR
POD1000000021_S0000100	NO BECAUSE

POD1000000021_S0000104	IN GOOD TIMES MOST PEOPLE IN LOUISIANA LOVED HIS MISADVENTURES
POD1000000021_S0000105	BUT THESE WEREN'T GOOD TIMES THE BOOM YEARS OF THE NINETEEN SEVENTY S WERE LONG GONE

POD1000000021_S0000301	IN THE BEGINNING THE RACE FROM HELL WASN'T EXACTLY ROLLICKING
POD1000000021_S0000302	ONE REASON FOR THAT WAS A PACKAGE OF CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORMS PART OF BUDDY ROMER'S GOOD GOVERNMENT AGENDA
POD1000000021_S0000303	THE NEW LAW LIMITED INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN MAJOR STATEWIDE RACES
POD1000000021_S0000304	BANNED CASH CONTRIBUTIONS OF MORE THAN A HUNDRED DOLLARS AND REQUIRED THAT SMALL CASH DONATIONS BE REPORTED
POD1000000021_S0000305	DUKE COULD PASS THE BUCKET WITH IMPUNITY DURING HIS NINETEEN NINETY SENATE CAMPAIGN BECAUSE THAT WAS A FEDERAL RACE
POD1000000021_S0000306	BUT THANKS TO ROMER THE REVOLUTIONARY LOUISIANA'S GUIDELINES ON CASH GIVING WERE NOW STRICTER THAN THE NATION'S
POD1000000021_S0000307	HAMSTRUNG BY THESE NEW RULES DUKE HELD FEWER RALLIES AS A CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR THAN WHEN HE RAN FOR THE SENATE AND EDWARDS'S FUNDRAISING SLOWED TO A TRICKLE
POD1000000021_S0000308	HE'D RAISED SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS DURING THE NINETEN EIGHTY THREE GOVERNOR'S RACE
POD1000000021_S0000309	IN THE NINETEEN NINETY ONE PRIMARY HE BROUGHT IN A LITTLE MORE THAN ONE MILLION DOLLARS
POD1000000021_S0000310	AND BUDDY ROMER HE PREFERRED STAYING IN TO GOING OUT TO MEET HIS PUBLIC
POD1000000021_S0000311	ROMER HAD ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THIS
POD1000000021_S0000312	RAMOND STRATHER SAWIT UP CLOSE DURING THE NINETEENEIGHTY SEVEN RACE

POD1000000021_S0000315	SO NOBODY WOULD SEE HIM AND RECOGNIZE HIM AND COME OVER AND START TALKING
POD1000000021_S0000316	ROMER'S CHARISMATIC MISSANTHROPE ROUTINE HAD WORKED OUT FINE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
POD1000000021_S0000317	AND IT SEEMED POSSIBLE HE COULD PULL OFF THE SAME TRICK IN NINETE NINETY ONE

POD1000000021_S0000324	E WAS JUST REALLY ENGAGING THE CROWD
POD1000000021_S0000325	AND I WOULD SAY FOR THE FIRST PART OF THE CAMPAIGN THAT'S THE WAY HE WAS HE REALLY CAME INTO A ROOM AND MADE IT ALIVE
POD1000000021_S0000326	THE PROBLEM FOR ROMER WAS THAT A LOT OF SWING VOTERS FELT DRAWN TO ANOTHER CANDIDATE

POD1000000021_S0000347	HOWELL'S POLL IN THE PRIMARY HAD DUKEAT SEVEN PERCENT SHE WAS OFF BY TWENTY SIX POINTS
POD1000000021_S0000348	AND I WAS STUNNED AND THEN JOHN TREEN STOOD UP ON A TABLE AND HE WAS STUNNED TOO AND
POD1000000021_S0000349	I REMEMBER HIM SAYING THE PEOPLE OF MEDERI ARE NOT RACIST
POD1000000021_S0000350	AND I THOUGHT WELL MAYBE WE SHOULD RETHINK THAT
POD1000000021_S0000351	TREN FIRED HOWL AFTER THE PRIMARY SO SHE'D HAVE TO WAIT TO PULL ANOTHER DUKE RACE
POD1000000021_S0000352	BUT SHE HAD A PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH HIS SUPPORTERS
POD1000000021_S0000353	PEOPLE WERE RELUCTANT TO SAY I'M GONG TO VOTE FOR DUKE BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID OF BEING LABELED RACIST EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE TALKING O A YOU KNOW A ON AN ANONYMOUS PHONE CALL TO A POLSTER
POD1000000021_S0000354	IT'S LIKE PEOPLE ARE RELUCTANT TO SAY HOW MUCH ALCOHOL THEY DRINK OR WERE THEY EVER ARRESTED
POD1000000021_S0000355	THIS BECAME A RESEARCH CHALLENGE FOR HOWELL AND HER GRADUATE STUDENTS HOW COULD THEY GET DAVID DUKE'S SILENT ARMY TO BREAK ITS SILENCE
POD1000000021_S0000356	WE CAME UP WITH SOME ALTERNATE I WOULD CALL SNEAKIER INDIRECT QUESTIONS TO IDENTIFY SOMEONE WHO MIGHT BE SYMPATHETIC TO DUKE
POD1000000021_S0000357	ONE OF THEM WHICH ACTUALLY WORKED PRETTY WELL IN INCREASING THE DUKE SUPPORT IN THE POLL WAS TO ASK PEOPLE IF THEY APPROVE OR DISAPPROVE OF THE MARTIN LUTHER KING HOLIDAY
POD1000000021_S0000358	HOWELL CONDUCTED A SURVEY ONE MONTH BEFORE THE GUBRANATORIAL PRIMARY
POD1000000021_S0000359	RESPONDENTS WERE ASKED WHO THEY WERE VOTING FOR AND ALSO HOW THEY FELT ABOUT STATEMENTS LIKE IF BLACKS WOULD ONLY TRY HARDER THEY COULD BE JUST AS WELL OFF AS WHITES
POD1000000021_S0000360	THE RAW NUMBER SHOWED THAT THIRTY FIVE PERCENT OF PEOPLE WERE VOTING FOR BUDDY ROMER THIRTY PERCENT FOR EDWIN EDWARDS AND TWELVE PERCENT FOR DAVID DUKE
POD1000000021_S0000361	BUT WHEN HOWEL ACCOUNTED FOR HER SNEAKIER INDIRECT QUESTIONS SUPPORT FOR ROMER AND EDWARDS DIPPED AND DUKE'S SUPPORT DOUBLED
POD1000000021_S0000362	GIVEN THE MARGIN OF ERROR THE ELECTION WAS TOO CLOSE TO CALL
POD1000000021_S0000364	THAT'S HOW THINGS LOOKED FROM THE OUTSIDE ON THE INSIDE THERE WAS GOSSIP ABOUT A POSSIBLE SECRET ALLIANCE AND THE GOVERNOR'S RACE
POD1000000021_S0000365	ROMER'S POLITICAL CONSULTANT RAYMOND STRAUTHER HEARD THAT SPECULATION
POD1000000021_S0000366	THE RUMOR THAT WE HEARD WAS THAT EDWAND EDWARDS WAS ENCOURAGING AND PERHAPS FUNDING DAVID DUKE
POD1000000021_S0000368	EDWARDS WANTED REVENGE ON BUDDY ROMER AFTER LOSING TO HIM IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN BUT EDWARDS ALSO KNEW HOW TO PLAY THE ODDS
POD1000000021_S0000369	HE WAS SMART ENOUGH THE THEORY WENT TO SENSE THAT HE'D HAVE A BETTER SHOT AGAINST AN X CLANSMAN THAN AGAINST THE INCUMBENT GOVERNOR
POD1000000021_S0000370	NOBODY HAD ANY PROOF WHATSOEVER
POD1000000021_S0000371	BUT I SELDOM RAN INTO ANYBODY ON EITHER SIDE WHO DIDN'T THINK THAT EDWARDS WAS PLAYING FUNNY WITH DAVID DUKE
POD1000000021_S0000373	WHEN I GOT EDWARDS ON THE PHONE
POD1000000021_S0000374	I ASKED IF THERE WAS ANY TRUTH TO ALL THAT CHATTER
POD1000000021_S0000376	DID HE OR HIS SUPPORTERS DO ANYTHING TO HELP DUKE MAKE THE RUNOFF
POD1000000021_S0000377	LIKE EITHER GIVING HIM MONEY OR OR PROPPING HIM UP IN SOME WAY
POD1000000021_S0000378	DID YOU OR YOUR SUPPORTERS DO ANYTHING TO HELP DUK GET INTO THE RUNOFF WITH YOU
POD1000000021_S0000379	NO I DIDN'T I DIDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS NECESSARY AND I WOULDAVE MAYBE GOT CAUGHT AT IN SO I DIDN'T DO THAT
POD1000000021_S0000380	I JUST LET HIM RUN HIS RACE I RAN MINE ROMA RAN HIS
POD1000000021_S0000382	AND THAT'S AS FAR AS I GOT CHASING DOWN THAT RUMOR
POD1000000021_S0000383	BUT I DID LEARN SOMETHING ELSE
POD1000000021_S0000384	THE EDWARDS CAMPAIGN IT TURNS OUT HAD A TOTALLY DIFFERENT SECRET ALLIANCE
POD1000000021_S0000386	CLYDE HOLLOWAY WAS THE PRO LIFE CONGRESSMAN WHO'D GOTTEN THE OFFICIAL ENDORSEMENT OF THE LOUISIANA REPUBLICAN PARTY
POD1000000021_S0000387	INSTEAD OF DUK ROMER HE WAS WAY BACK IN THE POLLES IN A DISTANT FORTH AND NEEDED CASH TO AIR COMMERCIALS
POD1000000021_S0000388	ONE OF EDWIN EDWARDS'S CLOSEST FRIENDS

POD1000000021_S0000393	HOLLOWAY WAS RECEIVING OR GETTING WAS COMING DIRECTLY OFF OF THE SITTING GOVERNOR BUDDY ROA
POD1000000021_S0000394	AND WE WOULD HAVE PEOPLE THAT WERE NOCXED OUT OR HAVE A LOT OF MONEY TO SUPPORT
POD1000000021_S0000395	WHEN BOA ASKED ME WHAT ELSE TE COULD DO I SA WE GET THESE COMMERCIALS ON TV AND RADIO
POD1000000021_S0000396	I SAID THAT WOULD HELP US POSSIBLY GETTING IN TH SECOND PRIMARY WITH DAVID DU RATHER THAN A SITTING GOVERNOR

POD1000000021_S0000400	ROMER SLIDES OUT OF THE RUNOFF AND DUKE SLIDES IN
POD1000000021_S0000401	WE FELT THAT WE COULD BEAT DAVID DUKE SUBSTANTIALLY AND MAT ROMA WOULD HAVE BEEN A DIFFERENT RESULT
POD1000000021_S0000403	PULLING AT THE TIME SAID IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TIGHT
POD1000000021_S0000404	DID GOVERNOR EDWARDS KNOW ABOUT THIS STRATEGY
POD1000000021_S0000405	YES I INFORMED HIM THAT IT WA TIS THAT IT WAS GOING ON HIS ANSWER WAS BE CAREFUL
POD1000000021_S0000407	WHEN I ASKED EDWARDS ABOUT THE ALLIANCE HE TOLD ME HE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT
POD1000000021_S0000408	IN JOHN MCGINNES'S BOOK ABOUT THE NINETEEN NINETY ONE CAMPAIGN CLYDE HOLLOWAY'S CAMPAIGN ADVISER BRIAN WAGNER ALSO DENIED MAKING ANY SUCH DEAL
POD1000000021_S0000409	WAGNER DIED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN
POD1000000021_S0000410	THAT SAID I BELIEVED A HIMMACOURT' STORY
POD1000000021_S0000411	TO BE CLEAR NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN ILLEGAL ASSUMING THE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS GOT REPORTED
POD1000000021_S0000412	BUT IT WAS KIND OF DEVIOUS A WAY TO HELP DAVID DUKE WITHOUT GIVING HIM DIRECT SUPPORT
POD1000000021_S0000413	I DON'T WANT TO MAKE THIS ALLIANCE SEEM MORE IMPORTANT THAN IT WAS
POD1000000021_S0000414	THOSE HALLOWAY ADS WERE JUST A SMALL DROP IN AN ENORMOUS BUCKET OF CAMPAIGN SPENDING
POD1000000021_S0000415	IN THE FINAL DAYS OF THE RACE THE OWNER OF A HAZARDOUS WASTE RECYCLING COMPANY SPENT A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF MONEY ON ANTI ROMER COMMERCIALS BECAUSE HE WAS ANGRY ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS
POD1000000021_S0000416	THAT ADDBY WAS A HUGE DEAL
POD1000000021_S0000417	THE HOLLOWAY ADS REALLY WEREN'T
POD1000000021_S0000418	BUT IT'S STILL TELLING THAT THE EDWARDS CAMPAIGN WAS WILLING TO TAKE ACTIVE MEASURES TO HELP DUKE GET INTO THE RUNOFF
POD1000000021_S0000419	I THINK IT IS VERY TYPICAL OF EDWIN EDWARDS
POD1000000021_S0000420	THAT'S QUIN HILLIER HE WAS ONE OF LOUISIANA'S MOST PROMINENT ANTI DUKE REPUBLICANS
POD1000000021_S0000421	HE ALSO THINKS EDWARDS IS TOTALLY CORRUPT
POD1000000021_S0000422	HERE'S WHAT HE HAD TO SAY ABOUT THE EDWARDS HALLOWAY ALLIANCE
POD1000000021_S0000423	I'M NOT SAYING IT'S IMMORAL IT'S JUST AMORAL COMPLETELY WITHOUT REGARD TO THE MORALITY OF TRYING TO HELP DAVID DUKE GET INTO THE RUNOFF AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT WOULD BE GOOD OR BAD FOR THE STATE OF LOUISIANA
POD1000000021_S0000424	IT CERTAINLY WAS PLAYING EVERY POLITICAL ANGLE AND IT WAS EDWIN EDWARDS AND HIS PEOPLE AT THEIR EDWIN EDWARDSIST
POD1000000021_S0000426	THIS WAS IN SOME WAYS TYPICAL LOUISIANA CHICANERY
POD1000000021_S0000427	POLITICS IS SPORT WITH A WIN AT ALL COST MENTALITY
POD1000000021_S0000428	BUT DUKE WASN'T A TYPICAL CANDIDATE
POD1000000021_S0000429	MAYBE THE EDWARDS CAMP WAS RIGHT THAT THEIR ODDS WERE BETTER AGAINST DUKE THAN ROMER
POD1000000021_S0000430	BUT WHAT IF THEY WERE WRONG WHAT IF DAVID DUKE WON

POD1000000021_S0000454	WITH EVERY MINUTE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IT APPEARS THAT WE WILL BE IN A RUNOFF FOR THE GOVERNORSHIP OF LOUISIANA NEWORL
POD1000000021_S0000456	BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE AT DUKE'S FIRST VICTORY PARTY HE'D SHOUTED ABOUT WINNING A STATE HOUSE SEAT WITHOUT ANY BIG POLITICAL ENDORSEMENTS
POD1000000021_S0000457	HE'D ALSO COMPLAINED ABOUT THE MEDIA AND THE POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT AND WHINED THAT HE WAS ALWAYS GETTING LIED ABOUT
POD1000000021_S0000458	IN NINETEN NINETY ONE HE DIDN'T SOUND BITTER OR VENGEFUL
POD1000000021_S0000459	THIS DAVID DUKE WAS SMOOTH HUMBLE CONCILIATORY
POD1000000021_S0000460	HE'D FIGURED OUT HOW HE WAS SUPPOSED TO SOUND AND HOW TO MAKE AN APPEAL THAT WASN'T ENTIRELY BASED ON GRIEVANCE
POD1000000021_S0000461	MY THANKS GOES FIRST TO THE FORCE IN MY LIFE THAT'S GIVEN ME STRENGTH AND HELPED ME
POD1000000021_S0000463	WI STAND ALOT AND CONTINUE TO STAND UP FOR YOU
POD1000000021_S0000464	AND THAT'S JESUS CHRIST LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THATS
POD1000000021_S0000467	DAVID DUKE WAS IN THE RUNOFF WITH THIRTY TWO PERCENT OF THE VOTE
POD1000000021_S0000468	DUKE FINISHED JUST TWO POINTS BEHIND THE LEADER
POD1000000021_S0000469	EDWIN EDWARDS BUDDY ROMER'S POLITICAL CONSULTANT RAYMOND STRATHER KNEW HIS MAN WAS GOING TO COME IN THIRD
POD1000000021_S0000470	HE WENT TO BED AT THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION BEFORE THE RACE GOT CALLED
POD1000000021_S0000471	AND THE NEXT MORNING I GOT UP AND I WENT DOWN TO GET MY COOKIES AND MILK
POD1000000021_S0000472	AND BUDDY WAS DOWN THERE AND HE SAID WELL YOU DIDN'T HAVE A GOOD CANDITE DID YOU
POD1000000021_S0000473	I SAID MUST NOT HAVE BUDDY
POD1000000021_S0000474	HE SAID WELL WE TOOK OUR BEST SHOT AND HE WALKED OUT AN THAT'S THE LAST TIME I'VE EVER SPOKEN TO I
POD1000000021_S0000475	BUDDY ROMER FINISHED FIVE POINTS BEHIND DAVID DUKE
POD1000000021_S0000476	ULTIMATELY HE WASN'T TAKEN DOWN BY AN ELECTORAL CONSPIRACY
POD1000000021_S0000477	HE'D LOST BECAUSE LOUISIANA DIDN'T WANT A REFORMER
POD1000000021_S0000478	AND TONIGHT THE PEOPLE SPOKE AND THEY SAID BUDDY THANKS BUT YOU DIDN'T DO ENOUGH AND I THINK THAT'S FAIR
POD1000000021_S0000479	WHEN MICHELLE SHAWER STARTED WORKING ON THE CAMPAIGN SHE'D BEEN INSPIRED BY BUDDY ROMER'S ENERGY
POD1000000021_S0000480	BUT NOW THAT IT WAS OVER SHAWER THOUGHT ROMER ACTUALLY SEEMED RELIEVED
POD1000000021_S0000481	SHE FOUND HER OWN FEELINGS HARDER TO PIN DOWN
POD1000000021_S0000482	SHE WAS THINKING ABOUT LEAVING THE STATE MAYBE GOING TO LIVE WITH HER PARENTS IN MONTANA
POD1000000021_S0000483	BUT THEN SHE GOT APPROACHED BY SOME PEOPLE SHE KNEW FROM THE LOUISIANA REPUBLICAN PARTY
POD1000000021_S0000484	THEY SAID WE HAVE AN OFFER FOR YOU BEFORE YOU REJECT IT OUTRIGHT
POD1000000021_S0000485	JUST LISTEN TO US AND THEY SAID YOU COULD GO TO WORK ON DAVID DUKE'S CAMPAIGN
POD1000000021_S0000486	OF COURSE MY EYES WIDEN LIKE ARE YOU CRAZY
POD1000000021_S0000487	SHOWER HAD NEVER CONSIDERED SUPPORTING DAVID DUKE MUCH LESS WORKING FOR HIM
POD1000000021_S0000488	HER FAMILY HAD BEEN ON GOVERNMENT AID WHEN SHE WAS GROWING UP SO HIS RANTS AGAINST WELFARE WEREN'T PERSUASIVE
POD1000000021_S0000489	BUT SHAWER REALLY DIDN'T WANT EDWIN EDWARDS BACK IN CHARGE OF LOUISIANA
POD1000000021_S0000490	PLUS THOSE PEOPLE FROM THE STATE PARTY TOLD HER THAT SHE DIDN'T NEED TO TAKE A PUBLIC FACING ROLE
POD1000000021_S0000491	THAT SHE COULD STAY IN THE SHADOWS
POD1000000021_S0000492	SHOWER AGREED TO MEET WITH DUKE'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER HOWE FRRELL
POD1000000021_S0000493	WHEN THEY GOT TOGETHER HE SAID THAT THE TIME HAD COME TO BROADEN THE DUKE OPERATION BY BRINGING IN PEOPLE FROM THE ESTABLISHMENT
POD1000000021_S0000494	SHAER WANTED TO BE A CAMPAIGN MANAGER SOMEDAY
POD1000000021_S0000495	AND SHE LIKED THE IDEA OF LEARNING FROM ONE SHE WAS ALSO UNEMPLOYED
POD1000000021_S0000496	SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I HAD A JOB AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT AN ALTERNATE CAMPAIGN AND THAT'S HOW I STARTED
POD1000000021_S0000498	DURING HER STINT AS A DUKE STAFFER MICHELE SHAWER WOULD HEAR THINGS THAT SHOCKED HER
POD1000000021_S0000499	SHE'D ALSO MAKE A LOT OF PHONE CALLS ON BEHALF OF DAVID DUKE USING A LIST SHE'D BROUGHT WITH HER FROM THE ROMER CAMPAIGN
POD1000000021_S0000500	THAT LIST WAS THE MAIN REASON THE DUKE CAMPAIGN HAD HIRED SHOWER
POD1000000021_S0000501	ROMER'S SUPPORTERS WERE NOW UP FOR GRABS IF THEY VOTED REPUBLICAN IN THE NOVEMBER RUNOFF
POD1000000021_S0000502	THEN DAVID DUKE WAS GOING TO BE THE GOVERNOR OF LOUISIANA
POD1000000021_S0000503	THE STATE REPUBLICAN PARTY WAS STILL NOT GOING TO SUPPORT DUKE PUBLICLY BUT HE WAS THE LAST REPUBLICAN STANDING
POD1000000021_S0000504	AND WHEN SHAWER TALKED TO HER FRIENDS IN THE PARTY THEY SAID THEY KNEW HOW TO KEEP DUKE UNDER CONTROL
POD1000000021_S0000505	WHEN I WOULD HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS THEY WOULD SAY YOU KNOW THERE'S NOT MUCH HE CAN DO
POD1000000021_S0000506	HE'S GONNA HAVE SO MANY EYES ON HIM IF HE WINS
POD1000000021_S0000507	THERE'S SO MANY EYES WE'RE GONNA HAVE PEOPLE AROUND HIM
POD1000000021_S0000508	HE WON'T BE ABLE TO PUSH FORWARD ANY OF THESE AGENDAS FROM HIS PAST
POD1000000021_S0000509	HE'LL HAVE TO STICK TO THE POLICIES
POD1000000021_S0000510	AND AT THAT TIME I BELIEVE THEM
POD1000000021_S0000511	AND AT THAT TIME I THOUGHT WHILE I WASN'T REALLY WILLING TO SAY I WAS FOR HIM I WAS MORE FOR SWEEPING INA REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR TO TRY TO FIX THINGS IN LOUISIANA

POD1000000021_S0000530	SPECIAL THANKS TO JORDAN HIRSH JESSICA SEIDMAN AND SLATE'S CHAOW TWU KATYE RAYFORD LAURA BENNETT ALISON BENEDICT AND JARED HOLT
POD1000000021_S0000531	THANKS FOR LISTENING
POD1000000023_S0000000	HELLO EVERYONE I'M STEPHEN WEST THIS IS PHILOSOPHIE THIS THANK YOU TO EVERYONE THAT CONTINUES TO SUPPORT THE SHOW ON PATREON AD A SPECIAL THANK YOU TO THOSE OF YOU THAT UPPED YOUR PLEDGE DURING THESE UNCERTAIN TIMES
POD1000000023_S0000001	I'M BEYOND GRATEFUL AND I'M NOT GON T TAKE UP ANY MORE YOUR TIME TODAY'S EPISODES ON THE POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OF RICHARD RORDY I HOPE YOU LOVE THE SHOW TODAY
POD1000000023_S0000003	SO IF YOU'RE HAVING A POLITICAL DISCUSSION WITH SOMEONE AND THE CONVERSATION TOOK A TURN AND ALL O A SUDEN YOU GUYS ARE TALKING ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS
POD1000000023_S0000004	THERE'S CERTAINLY A LOT OF DIFFERENT ANGLES YOU COULD APPROACH THAT DISCUSSION FROM BUT ONE OF THE MOST COMMON ONES MIGHT BE WHAT PHILOSOPHICAL GROUNDING CAN WE GIVE TO SOMETHING LIKE HUMAN RIGHTS
POD1000000023_S0000005	I MEAN WE ALL THINK HUMAN BEINGS HAVE RIGHTS BUT WHERE EXACTLY DO THOSE RIGHTS COME FROM WHO OR WHAT OUT THERE GUARANTEES THESE RIGHTS FOR PEOPLE
POD1000000023_S0000006	WELL A COMMON ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION MIGHT BE THAT HUMAN RIGHTS ARE INHERITED BY BIRTHRIGHT SIMPLY BY VIRTUE OF BEING BORN EVERY HUMAN BEING IS ENTITLED TO CERTAIN NATURAL RIGHTS OR INALIENABLE RIGHTS
POD1000000023_S0000007	RIGHTS THAT PROTECT THE DIGNITY OF A HUMAN LIFE AT SUCH A BASIC LEVEL THAT TO GO AGAINST THEM STARTS TO SEEM LIKE YOU'D BE GOING AGAINST NATURE
POD1000000023_S0000008	NOW AS FAR AS THE PHILOSOPHICAL GROUNDING IS CONCERNED THIS IS AN ATTITUDE MUCH MORE COMMON DURING THE BEGINNING OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT THAN IT IS TODAY
POD1000000023_S0000009	AND THE TWO MAIN THINKERS THAT TOOK ON THIS POSITION ARE OFTEN CIGTED TO BE JOHN LOCK AND EMANUEL CANT
POD1000000023_S0000010	WHEN IT COMES TO ANSWERING THE QUESTION OF WHO OR WHAT GUARANTEES THESE HUMAN RIGHTS JOHN LOCK GOES IN THE DIRECTION OF GOD YOU KNOW WE ARE ENDOWED BY OUR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN INALIENABLE RIGHTS
POD1000000023_S0000011	AND KANT GOES MORE IN THE DIRECTION OF APRIORI FACTS DERIVED FROM REASON BUT EITHER WAY THESE THINKERS ARE IN THEIR OWN WAY TRYING TO USE REASON TO ARRIVE AT A UNIVERSAL THAT GUARANTEES HUMAN BEINGS ARE BORN WITH NATURAL RIGHTS
POD1000000023_S0000012	LITTLE DID EITHER OF THESE THINKERS KNOW THAT JUST A HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS LATER WE'D BE IMMERSED IN TWO WORLD WARS THAT WOULD MAKE THE ARGUMENT FOR THE NATURAL RIGHTS OF HUMAN BEINGS SEEM ABOUT AS IMPORTANT AS NECK RUFFLES WERE TO THEM
POD1000000023_S0000013	SEE AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ON THIS SHOW THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY WAS FULL OF THINKERS DISSATISFIED WITH WHAT THE ENLIGHTENMENT HAD PRODUCED THEY EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT THE ENTIRE PROJECT OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT WAS DESTINED TO CONSUME ITSELF FROM THE START
POD1000000023_S0000014	YEAH SURE AT THE BEGINNING REASON CALLS INTO QUESTION MUCH OF THE RELIGIOUS DOGMA OF THE MIDDLE AGES BUT WHAT INEVITABLY HAS TO HAPPEN ONCE IT GETS DONE WITH THAT JOB IS REASON HAS TO START QUESTIONING THE NEW FOUNDATIONS FOR THINGS
POD1000000023_S0000015	REASON HAS TO START QUESTIONING ITSELF WHICH THEN LEADS THE PHILOSOPHERS USING THE PROCESS OF RATIONALITY TO FIND OUT THAT RATIONALITY IS NOT SOME UNBIASED A HISTORICAL MEASURING TOOL
POD1000000023_S0000016	IT'S NOT SOME NEUTRAL POINT FROM WHICH WE CAN MAKE UNAMBIGUOUS CLAIMS ABOUT THE TRUTH OF HUMAN RIGHTS OR MORE IMPORTANTLY THE UNIVERSE TO THE THINKER WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT TODAY RICHARD RORDEY
POD1000000023_S0000017	PEOPLE LIKE LOCK AND KANT WERE NO MORE DISCOVERING A TRUTH ABOUT WHAT GROUNDS HUMAN RIGHTS THAN HAMARABI WAS BEFORE THEM
POD1000000023_S0000018	BUT UNLIKE MANY OF THE THINKERS OF THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY WHO MAY HAVE FELT A BIT DISENFRANCHISED BY THE RATIONAL PROCESS RICHARD RORDY FELT OPTIMISTIC ABOUT RATIONALITY
POD1000000023_S0000019	SOME PEOPLE CALLED RORDY A POST MODERNIST WHICH WOULD USUALLY PLACE HIM IN STAUNCH OPPOSITION TO ANYTHING THAT EVEN SOUNDS LIKE THE WORD ENLIGHTENMENT
POD1000000023_S0000020	LIKE EXCITEMENT BUT LET ME TELL YOU RODY WAS A VERY EXCITING MAN HE REJECTED THE TITLE OF POST MODERNIST AND MOST TITLES FOR THAT MATTER
POD1000000023_S0000021	HE OPERATED IN A VERY UNIQUE REALM FOR A THINKER WHERE LIKE A TYPICAL POST STRUCTURALIST HE DIDN'T BELIEVE IN ANY SORT OF GRAND NARRATIVE THAT COULD EXPLAIN AWAY THE UNIVERSE
POD1000000023_S0000022	BUT YET HE WAS STILL A DY HARD CARD CARRYING FAN OF THE PROJECT OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT OVERALL
POD1000000023_S0000023	SEE IN A WORLD WHERE THERE'S SO MANY TWENTIETH CENTURY THINKERS HATENG ON THE ENLIGHTENMENT HERE'S A GUY SOME PEOPLE VIEWED AS A POST STRUCTURALIST COMING TO ITS DEFENSE
POD1000000023_S0000024	LET ME EXPLAIN WHY HE'D EVEN DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS
POD1000000023_S0000025	WHEN IMANUEL CANT IN HIS FAMOUS ESSAY DESCRIBES THE ENLIGHTENMENT AS MAN'S REMOVAL OF HIS SELF INCURRED TUTLAGE YEAH HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE TUTILAGE OF THE RELIGIOUS DOGMA OF THE PAST
POD1000000023_S0000026	BUT RODY WOULD EXTEND THAT TUTLAGE TO THE RATIONAL DOGMA THAT WAS TO COME IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE OF HOW OVERAMBITIOUS WE WERE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT ABOUT WHAT RATIONALITY COULD PRODUCE
POD1000000023_S0000027	THE SPIRIT OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT TORORTY WAS NOT TO USE REASON TO ARRIVE AT THE TRUTH ABOUT THE UNIVERSE
POD1000000023_S0000028	IT WAS ULTIMATELY A CALL TO SUBVERT TRADITIONAL FORMS OF AUTHORITY THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT WAS NOT TO LAND ON NEW ANSWERS
POD1000000023_S0000029	IT WAS TO QUESTION OLD ASSUMPTIONS SO IN THAT SENSE YEAH THE INITIAL PROJECT OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT ULTIMATELY CONSUMED ITSELF
POD1000000023_S0000030	BUT TO RICHARD WORDY THE INITIAL PROJECT OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT WAS MEANT TO CONSUME ITSELF THINKERS LIKE ISAIAH BERLIN THAT WOULD COME ALONG AND SUGGEST A PLURALISTIC VISION OF THINGS
POD1000000023_S0000031	THIS WASN'T AN ANTI ENLIGHTENMENT IDEA AT ALL TO ROADY THIS WAS THE PROJECT OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT LEFT TO PLAY ITSELF OUT
POD1000000023_S0000032	THINKERS LIKE BERLIN WERE ALWAYS GOING TO EVENTUALLY COME ALONG
POD1000000023_S0000033	SEE THE PROJECT OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT MATURING THROUGH PEOPLE LIKE ISAIAH BERLIN TAUGHT US A COUPLE OF EXTREMELY VALUABLE INSIGHTS
POD1000000023_S0000034	ONE OF WHICH WAS THAT WE DON'T NEED TO TRY TO USE REASON TO APPEAL TO SOME ULTIMATE AUTHORITY OR UNIVERSAL TO GROUND OUR IDEAS
POD1000000023_S0000035	RATIONALITY IS NOT A TOOL THAT GETS US TO OBJECTIVITY ABOUT THINGS
POD1000000023_S0000036	UT IT MAY GET US A VERY EFFECTIVE MIX OF INTERSUBJECTIVITY BETWEEN CULTURES
POD1000000023_S0000037	WORDY WANTS TO OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE WAY OF LOOKING AT THE LEGACY OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT
POD1000000023_S0000038	MAYBE IT IS POINTLESS TO TRY TO DO OUR BEST IMPRESSIONS OF LOCK AND KANT AND TO TRY TO ACCESS THE UNIVERSE THROUGH REASON
POD1000000023_S0000039	BUT WHEN IT COMES TO STRICTLY HUMAN INSTITUTIONS FOR EXAMPLE THE POLITICAL REALM WHERE WE'RE NOT TRYING TO ACCESS THINGS IN THEMSELVES
POD1000000023_S0000040	WE'RE JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN LIVE TOGETHER THE BEST MAYBE THAT IS WHERE RATIONALITY THRIVES AS A METHOD
POD1000000023_S0000041	WHAT ALL THIS IS ALLUDING TO IS THE FACT THAT HUMAN RIGHTS ARE NOT THE ONLY THINGS PHILOSOPHERS HAVE TRIED TO GROUND IN UNIVERSALS IN THE PAST
POD1000000023_S0000042	THE VERY STRUCTURE OF SOME POLITICAL SYSTEMS LIBERALISM FOR EXAMPLE HAS ALSO HISTORICALLY BEEN GROUNDED IN UNIVERSALS
POD1000000023_S0000043	ONCE AGAIN I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY BECAUSE THERE'S SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT GET ANGRY VERY QUICKLY
POD1000000023_S0000044	AND THEY ALSO MUST BE PART OF SOME SORT OF EMAIL CLUB THAT'S OUT THERE
POD1000000023_S0000045	WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LIBERALISM AS A FOUNDATION FOR SOCIETY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A GOVERNMENT WITH A FOCUS ON INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS CONSENT TO THE GOVERNED AND AVERSION TO ANY SORT OF COLLECTIVIST SYSTEM OR SYSTEMS THAT WERE POPULAR AT OTHER POINTS IN HISTORY MAYBE A CAST SYSTEM FOR EXAMPLE
POD1000000023_S0000046	NOW YOU CAN IMAGINE IF YOU'RE A PHILOSOPHER AND YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE A CASE FOR LIBERALISM BEING BETTER THAN A CAST SYSTEM
POD1000000023_S0000047	MIGHT BE TEMPTING TO START TO MAKE AN ARGUMENT THAT HUMAN BEINGS AT THE LEVEL OF THE UNIVERSE ARE ALL EQUAL AND THEREFORE SHOULD NOT BE RELEGATED TO DIFFERENT RANKS WITHIN A SOCIETY
POD1000000023_S0000048	BUT TO RORDY THIS WOULD BE MAKING THE SAME MISTAKE THAT LOCK AND KANT MADE IN OUR EXAMPLE FROM BEFORE ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS
POD1000000023_S0000049	THE FACT IS TO RORDY WE DON'T NEED THAT SORT OF ULTIMATE FOUNDATION TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A CASE FOR THE FACT THAT LIBERALISM'S HOW WE SHOULD BE RUNNING THINGS
POD1000000023_S0000050	FOR MANY DIFFERENT REASONS ONE LIKE WE ALREADY SAID WE CAN'T ACTUALLY ACCESS THE UNIVERSE AT THAT LEVEL THROUGH RATIONALITY
POD1000000023_S0000051	TWO SOCIETY IS JUST FAR BETTER OFF WHEN IT CAN BASE PUBLIC POLICY ON THE RATIONAL CONSENSUS OF INDIVIDUAL CITIZENS RATHER THAN A PHILOSOPHICAL THEORY ARRIVED AT BY SOME GUY IN A TOWER THAT PEOPLE MIGHT NOT EVEN BE ABLE TO RELATE TO
POD1000000023_S0000052	THINK OF THE LIMITATIONS YOU INSTANTLY PLACE ON YOURSELF IF YOU DECIDE THAT EVERY PUBLIC POLICY OR VALUE OF A SOCIETY NEEDS TO BE GROUNDED IN SOME PHILOSOPHICAL JUSTIFICATION THAT TELLS YOU HOW HUMAN BEINGS ARE AT LARGE
POD1000000023_S0000053	FIRST OF ALL LET'S SAY YOU DECIDED TO STRUCTURE YOUR SOCIETY AROUND THE POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OF PLATO
POD1000000023_S0000054	YOU'RE SOON GOING TO FIND YOURSELF ON A CONSTANT PR CAMPAIGN TRYING TO CONTINUOUSLY SELL THESE IDEAS TO A POPULATION JUST CROSSING YOUR FINGERS AS THEY GO ALONG WITH IT
POD1000000023_S0000055	SECOND OF ALL ALMOST ALWAYS THESE PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS THAT YOU MIGHT STRUCTURE YOUR SOCIETY AROUND WERE CREATED IN AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT CULTURE THAT EMERGED OUT OF AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT HISTORY
POD1000000023_S0000056	WHICH MEANS THESE THEORIES CAN BRING A LOT OF BAGGAGE ALONG WITH THEM THAT YOU MAY NOT WANT IN THE PRESENT CULTURE
POD1000000023_S0000057	THIRDLY YOU ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE FIGHTING A SORT OF LOSING BATTLE TO RORDY BECAUSE YOU WILL ALWAYS BE TRYING TO CRAM ONE INTERPRETATION OF HOW HUMAN LIFE SHOULD BE STRUCTURED INTO THE ENORMOUSLY COMPLEX PLURALISTIC MAILSTREAM OF PEOPLE CO EXISTING TOGETHER
POD1000000023_S0000058	RORDY IS ESSENTIALLY SAYING MAYBE WE DON'T NEED THE PHILOSOPHER UP IN THE TOWER THINKING ALL DAY TELLING US HOW TO STRUCTURE OUR SOCIETIES BECAUSE WELL I'VE DECIDED IT SHORES UP WITH HOW THE UNIVERSE IS
POD1000000023_S0000059	MAYBE WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE WAY THE UNIVERSE IS BUT MAYBE THAT DOESN'T MATTER MAYBE WE DON'T NEED SOME ELABORATE PHILOSOPHICAL THEORY TO STRUCTURE OUR SOCIETY FOR US MAYBE A STRATEGY IS LEGITIMATE
POD1000000023_S0000060	LIBERALISM FOR INSTANCE IF THE CITIZENS OF A PARTICULAR CULTURE POSITIONED IN HISTORY AT A PARTICULAR TIME AND PLACE ALL THE CITIZENS FACING A VERY SPECIFIC SET OF COMMON PROBLEMS THAT THEY NEED TO SOLVE
POD1000000023_S0000061	MAYBE A STRATEGY IS LEGITIMATE IF THE PEOPLE OF THAT SOCIETY DECIDE THAT THEY HAVE CONFIDENCE IN IT BECAUSE ONE THING'S FOR SURE ONE ULTIMATE THEORY IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH
POD1000000023_S0000062	RODY WHO WAS A HUGE FAN OF ISAIAH BERLIN SOMETIMES TALKS IN HIS WORK ABOUT THE QUOTE FACT OF PLURALISM
POD1000000023_S0000063	THIS IS WHAT A SOCIETY IS TO RORDY WE ARE WORSE OFF AS A SOCIETY IF WE TRY TO USE A SINGLE RELIGIOUS OR PHILOSOPHICAL THEORY TO JUSTIFY OUR POLITICAL STRATEGY
POD1000000023_S0000064	YOU WILL ALWAYS BE FIGHTING A LOSING BATTLE PEOPLE WILL ALWAYS ARRIVE AT A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS
POD1000000023_S0000065	SO INSTEAD OF EMBARKING ON A NEVER ENDING SALES CAMPAIGN FOR AN IDEA WORDY SUGGESTS THAT WE ALLOW OUR POLITICAL STRATEGY TO REFLECT THE COMMON VALUES OF THE PEOPLE THAT MAKE UP THE CULTURE
POD1000000023_S0000066	HE WRITES ABOUT HOW IF WE DO THIS AND WE'RE CAREFUL EVENTUALLY IF YOU WERE HAVING THAT SAME CONVERSATION AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE AND YOU ASK SOMEBODY WHAT GROUNDS HUMAN RIGHTS
POD1000000023_S0000067	THE COMMON TENDENCY WON'T BE TO TRY TO APPEAL TO SOMETHING WRITTEN INTO THE UNIVERSE OR TO CITE SOME RELIGIOUS OR PHILOSOPHICAL JUSTIFICATION YOU READ IN A BOOK SOMEWHERE
POD1000000023_S0000068	THE NEW STANDARD WILL BE FOR PEOPLE TO SEE SOCIAL POLICY AS LEGITIMATE IF IT WAS APPROVED BY THE PEOPLE ACTUALLY LIVING IN THE CULTURE
POD1000000023_S0000069	WHEN ASKED THE QUESTION WHAT GROUNDS THIS PIECE OF SOCIAL POLICY THE ANSWER WON'T INVOLVE POINTING TO SOME PHILOSOPHER FROM THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO
POD1000000023_S0000070	YOU KNOW DEICART'S FAMOUS WORK A TREATIS CONCERNING WHY DRUGS SHOULD BE LEGALIZED AND WHY YOU SHOULD B ABLE TO USE YOUR CELL PHONE ON AN AIRPLANE NO NO
POD1000000023_S0000071	THE AUTHORITY LIES IN THE HANDS OF THE SET OF PEOPLE POSITIONED IN HISTORY WITH A VERY SPECIFIC SET OF PROBLEMS TO SOLVE THAT THEY CARE ABOUT
POD1000000023_S0000072	AND ONCE AGAIN TO RORDY NOT ONLY DO WE NOT NEED ANY MORE AUTHORITY THAN THAT WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO ANY AUTHORITY OTHER THAN THAT AND WE'RE BETTER OFF THIS WAY ANYWAY
POD1000000023_S0000073	SHULD B SAID THIS IS YET ANOTHER WAY WE CAN ACCESS AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION OF HOW WE CAN FIND A BRIDGE BETWEEN NATURE AND CULTURE
POD1000000023_S0000074	RODY OBVIOUSLY IS NOT APPEALING TO A SINGLE THEORY BUT HE ALSO IS NOT APPEALING TO PURE RELATIVISM OR HISTORICISM
POD1000000023_S0000075	HIS ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW WE CAN JUSTIFY OUR POLITICAL STRATEGY PLACE HIM IN WHAT I THINK IS THE MOST ACCURATE CATEGORY TO DESCRIBE SOME OF HIS BIGGEST IDEAS
POD1000000023_S0000076	ROTY IS OFTEN THOUGHT OF AS A PRAGMATIST AND I THINK WE CAN UNDERSTAND ROTY'S OVERALL POSITION A LITTLE BIT BTTER IF WE TAKE A SECOND TO TALK ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF TRUTH
POD1000000023_S0000077	MORE SPECIFICALLY THE KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TRADITIONAL WAYS PEOPLE HAVE VIEWED THE CONCEPT OF TRUTH AND THE WAY A PRAGMATIST LIKE RODY WOUD HAV VIEWED THE CONCEPT OF TRUTH
POD1000000023_S0000078	SO LET'S TALK FIRST ABOUT ONE OF THE MOST COMMON THEORIES OF WHAT CONSTITUTES TRUTH FROM THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY ONE THAT RICHARD RODEY THOUGHT HAS BEEN DOMINANT SINCE THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT
POD1000000023_S0000079	WHAT HE SOMETIMES CALLS THE REPRESENTATIONALIST PARADIGM SOMETIMES CALLED BY OTHERS THE CORRESPONDENCE THEORY OF TRUTH BUT LET ME TAKE A SECOND TO TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT IT IS
POD1000000023_S0000080	THE MOST BASIC IDEA IS SUPPOSE SOMEBODY SAYS A STATEMENT ABOUT THE WAY THINGS ARE IN THE WORLD HOW DO WE TELL IF THAT STATEMENT IS TRUE
POD1000000023_S0000081	WELL THAT STATEMENT IS TRUE IF IT REPRESENTS THE WAY THINGS REALLY ARE IN THE WORLD IF THERE'S A CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE DESCRIPTION AND REALITY THEN WE CAN SAY IT'S TRUE
POD1000000023_S0000082	NOW THERE'S OF COURSE MOUNTAINS OF DETAIL THAT WE COULD TALK ABOUT HERE BUT RICHARD BRODY DISAGREES WITH THE ENTIRE PREMISE OF THE CORRESPONDENCE THEORY EVEN AT THIS BASIC RUDIMENTARY LEVEL
POD1000000023_S0000083	WHENEVER YOU TRY TO CREATE A BRIDGE BETWEEN A DESCRIPTION YOU HAVE IN YOUR HEAD AND THE REALITY OF THE WORLD THA YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN EVER DESCRIBE ANYTHING IS THROUGH LANGUAGE
POD1000000023_S0000084	LANGUAGE MEDIATES OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH REALITY YOU CAN'T ACCESS REALITY WITHOUT LANGUAGE BUT TO RODIY IT EVEN GOES ONE STEP FURTHER THAN THIS
POD1000000023_S0000085	NOT ONLY IS LANGUAGE A MEDIUM BETWEEN US AND REALITY BUT LANGUAGE ACTUALLY CONSTITUTES REALITY
POD1000000023_S0000086	MEANING THAT THE LANGUAGE WE USE AND THE WAY WE USE IT CHANGES THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT REALITY
POD1000000023_S0000087	THIS COULD BE AN ENTIRE SERIES ON ITS OWN BUT THE POINT IS THAT CERTAIN LANGUAGES AND THE CULTURES THAT USE THEM FAVOUR CERTAIN HABITS OF INTERPRETING EVENTS
POD1000000023_S0000088	THESE INTERPRETATIONS GREATLY DETERMINE THE ENTIRE WAY WE SEE REALITY AND THE WAY HUMAN BEINGS PERCEIVE REALITY VARIES GREATLY FROM CULTURE TO CULTURE LANGUAGE TO LANGUAGE
POD1000000023_S0000089	SO THE IDEA THAT THERE'S SOME SORT OF CORRESPONDENCE OR REPRESENTATION GOING ON THAT THE WORLD OUT THERE IS SOMEHOW HELPING US VERIFY WHETHER STATEMENTS ARE TRUE OR FALSE
POD1000000023_S0000090	THAT'S JUST WRONG BECAUSE RODY THINKS IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO EVER STEP OUTSIDE THE PARAMETERS OF LANGUAGE AND ACCESS THE WORLD OF THINGS IN THEMSELVES THINGS INDEPENDENT OF THIS LANGUAGE THAT WE USE TO CATEGORIZE THEM
POD1000000023_S0000091	HE'S A VERY FAMOUS QUOTE THAT WILL BE EXTREMELY USEFUL FOR US FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE EPISODE HE SAID QUOTE THE WORLD DOES NOT SPEAK ONLY WE DO
POD1000000023_S0000092	THE WORLD CAN ONCE WE HAVE PROGRAMMED OURSELVES WITH A LANGUAGE CAUSE US TO HOLD BELIEFS BUT IT CANNOT PROPOSE A LANGUAGE FOR US TO SPEAK ONLY HUMAN BEINGS CAN DO THAT END QUOTE
POD1000000023_S0000093	SO IT SHOULD BE SAID RODE'S NOT TALKING ABOUT ORDINARY LANGUAGE WHEN HE WRITES THAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE'RE GONG TO GET DEEP INTO HERE IN A MINUTE BUT I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS COMPARISON HE'S MAKING HERE
POD1000000023_S0000094	BETWEEN ACCESSING THE WORLD VERSUS SOME SORT OF HUMAN CREATED TOOL THAT'S DEEPLY AFFECTED BY THE BONDS OF HISTORY AND CULTURE
POD1000000023_S0000095	THIS IS A CLASSIC MOVE THAT ROWNY MAKES THAT IF YOU WERE NEW TO ROADY MIGHT HELP YOU UNDERSTAND AN OUTLINE OF SOME OF THE TOPICS HE WANTS TO COVER FOR EXAMPLE LANGUAGE IS EXTREMELY USEFUL IN HUMAN AFFAIRS
POD1000000023_S0000096	IT'S JUST NOT CAPABLE OF DESCRIBING THE WORLD OF THINGS IN THEMSELVES OUTSIDE OF LANGUAGE
POD1000000023_S0000097	WE'LL CONSIDER HOW THIS COMPARES TO THE BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE WE HAVE LOCK AND KANT TRYING TO USE REASON TO ACCESS SOME SORT OF ULTIMATE TRUTH ABOUT THE UNIVERSE BUT HERE'S RODY SAYING THAT RATIONALITY IS MOST USEFUL IN HUMAN AFFAIRS LIKE THE REAM OF THE POLITICAL
POD1000000023_S0000098	THE WORLD DOES NOT SPEAK ONLY WE DO HERE'S ANOTHER ONE FROM THE ENLIGHTENMENT PEOPLE LIKE ROUSSEAU WHO BELIEVE IN SOME SORT OF UNDERLYING HUMAN NATURE NOBLE SAVAGES AS HE WOULD SAY
POD1000000023_S0000099	REALLY BEYOND THAT ANYONE THAT WANTS TO TAKE UP THE MANTLE OF THE COMMON ATTITUDE THAT HUMAN BEINGS AT THEIR VERY CORE DREAD SEEING OTHER HUMAN BEINGS SUFFER
POD1000000023_S0000100	THAT'S A COMMON ONE FOR PEOPLE TO HOLD THAT NATURALLY AS HUMAN BEINGS WE DON'T WANT TO SEE OTHER PEOPLE IN PAIN SO WE CAN RELY ON THE FACT THAT IF THINGS EVER GOT BAD ENOUGH ONE CULTURE WOULD ALWAYS COME TO THE AID OF ANOTHER CULTURE
POD1000000023_S0000101	RODY ACTUALLY RESPONDS TO THIS POSITION DIRECTLY IN AN INTERACTION WITH SIMON CRITCHLEY IN THE NINETY S SO RIGHT HERE HE'S REFERENCING THE IDEA THAT THERE'S SOME SORT OF DEFAULT ALTRUISM EMBEDDED INTO HUMAN NATURE
POD1000000023_S0000102	HE SAYS QUOTE MAYBE THERE IS SUCH A SENTIENT DISPOSITION BUT IT IS SO MALEABLE SO CAPABLE OF BEING COMBINED WITH INDIFFERENCE TO THE SUFFERING OF PEOPLE OF THE WRONG SORTS THAT IT GIVES US PRECIOUS LITTLE TO RELY ON
POD1000000023_S0000103	WE SHOULD JUST THANK OUR LUCKY STARS THAT THERE ARE QUITE A LOT OF PEOPLE NOWADAYS WHO ARE PRETTY CONSISTENTLY APPALLED BY HUMAN BEINGS SUFFERING UNNECESSARILY END QUOTE
POD1000000023_S0000104	SO HE'S SAYING MAYBE THERE IS SOME ASPECT OF HUMAN NATURE THAT MAKES PEOPLE NOT WANT TO SEE OTHERS SUFFER BUT IF THERE IS IT'S INCREDIBLY MALEABLE
POD1000000023_S0000105	THANK YOUR LUCKY STARS THAT THERE HAPPENE TO BE A LOT OF PEOPLE LIVING TODAY WHO DON'T WANT TO SEE UNNECESSARY SUFFERING BUT THE LARGER POINT THERE IS THAT ALSO IF YOU'RE A FAN OF LIBERALISM
POD1000000023_S0000106	THERE IS NOTHING WRITTEN INTO NATURE LIKE A GOD OR APRIORI FACTS THAT SAY LIBERALISM IS THE WAY
POD1000000023_S0000107	BUT THANK YOUR LUCKY STARS FOR THE LAST COUPLE HUNDRED YEARS THERE'VE BEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT BELIEVE IN IT AS A STRATEGY
POD1000000023_S0000108	SO WHILE WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE MOVE THAT ROADY'S MAKING HERE
POD1000000023_S0000109	PLACING A LOT OF AUTHORITY IN THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE ACTUALLY IMMERSED IN THE CULTURE THIS MAY START TO BRING UP A WHOLE NEW SET OF QUESTIONS ONE OF THE MOST PRESSING MIGHT BE THIS
POD1000000023_S0000110	IF THE AUTHORITY OF WHETHER A SOCIAL POLICY IS GOOD OR NOT LIES IN THE HANDS OF THE CITIZENS AND NOT EVEN A PHILOSOPHER CAN ARRIVE AT ABSOLUTE FOUNDATIONS FOR EVEN SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS HUMAN RIGHTS
POD1000000023_S0000111	DON'T THOSE CRITICISMS JUST INSTANTLY EXTEND TO MY BELIEFS AS AN INDIVIDUAL
POD1000000023_S0000112	LIKE HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GROUND MY WORLD VIEW IN ANYTHING THAT'S ENDURING ENOUGH THAT I CAN FEEL CONFIDENT ABOUT IT
POD1000000023_S0000113	THE SHORT ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION IS THAT YOU CAN'T AND THAT SHOULDN'T BOTHER YOU
POD1000000023_S0000114	THE LONGER ANSWER CAN BE FOUND IN ROWDY'S LENGTHY EXPLORATION OF THE CONCEPT OF IRONY
POD1000000023_S0000115	LET'S TALK ABOUT I RIGHT NOW SO A COMMON EMAIL I GET IS FROM A PERSON WHO SAYS SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF THIS
POD1000000023_S0000116	HI I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO THE SHW FOR A WHILE I'VE HEARD ABOUT A BUNCH F DIFFERENT PHILOSOPHERS AND I'VE GOTTEN TO A PLACE WHERE I FEEL THE COMPLEXITY OF THINGS MAKES ME FEEL PRETTY UNCERTAIN ABOUT CHOOSING A WORLD VIEW
POD1000000023_S0000117	SOMETIMES I FEEL AGNOSTIC ABOUT ALMOST EVERY ISSUE OF SUBSTANCE I CAN THINK OF BUT THIS CREATES A PROBLEM FOR ME BECAUSE I STILL NEED TO OPERATE IN DAY TO DAY LIFE
POD1000000023_S0000118	HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO LIVE A LIFE WHERE YOU'RE RADICALLY UNCERTAIN ABOUT THINGS BUT STILL CAPABLE OF FUNCTIONING ON AN EVERYDAY LEVEL
POD1000000023_S0000119	THERE ARE MANY ANSWERS TO THIS QUESTION BUT RICHARD RORDY OFFERS ONE OF THEM THROGHIS DISCUSSION OF LIVING A LIFE AS AN IRONIST
POD1000000023_S0000120	NOW BY IRONIST HE DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE SMELTIN' METAL DOWN AT THE HOME DEPO EVERY DAY THE TERM IRONIST IS A REFERENCE TO IRONY
POD1000000023_S0000121	TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE LIFE OF AN IRONIST THOUGH WE FIRST NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE MUCH MORE COMMON ALMOST UBIQUITOUS WAY THAT PEOPLE APPROACH FIGURING THINGS OUT ABOUT THE WORLD
POD1000000023_S0000122	A WAY OF THINKING DEEPLY EMBEDDED IN THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY
POD1000000023_S0000123	MOST PEOPLE VIEW THEIR INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT AS A PERSON AS A LINEAR PROGRESSION OF MOVING PAST APPEARANCES AND GETTING TO THE REALITY OF THE WORLD
POD1000000023_S0000124	THIS GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO PLATO'S ALLEGORY THE CAVE SHADOWS ON A CAVE WALL WE DO THE WORK OF A PHILOSOPHER AND EVENTUALLY CAN ESCEND OUT OF THE CAVE AND SEE THE SUN OR TRUE KNOWLEDGE FOR WHAT IT ACTUALLY IS
POD1000000023_S0000125	WELL THIS WAY OF VIEWING OURSELVES HAS BEEN A FIXTURE IN OUR CULTURES FOR SO LONG THAT IT'S THE WAY MANY PEOPLE SEE THEIR PROCESS OF GROWTH WHEN LEARNING ABOUT THE WORLD
POD1000000023_S0000126	THERE'S THIS INTUITIVE SENSE THAT WE'RE BORN WE'RE YOUNG DUMB NAIVE WE GET INFORMATION FROM OUR TEACHERS PARENTS BASIC NEWS SOURCES AND THERE'S A SENSE IN WHICH WE'RE LIVING IN A WORLD OF APPEARANCES AT THIS POINT
POD1000000023_S0000127	SEE IT'S NOT UNTIL WE'VE DONE THE WORK OF READING FIVE NEWSPAPERS A DAY READING A THOUSAND BOOKS TRAVELIN TO A HUNDRED DIFFERENT COUNTRIES NOT UNTIL WE'VE DONE THAT CAN WE SAY THAT WE'VE ARRIVED AT A WORLDVIEW THAT SEES REALITY ON REALITYE'S TERMS
POD1000000023_S0000128	BUT JUST AS THERE'S NO SINGLE THEORY EMBEDDED INTO THE UNIVERSE ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS OR POLITICAL STRATEGY OR ANYTHING FOR THAT MATTER
POD1000000023_S0000129	THERE'S NO SINGLE CORRECT VIEW OF EXISTENCE THAT YOU'RE SOMEHOW ACCESSING THROUGH LIFE EXPERIENCES AND READING A BUNCH OF STUFF
POD1000000023_S0000130	YOU MAY THINK THAT YOU HAVE A RATIONAL JUSTIFICATION FOR EVERY VIEW THAT YOU HOLD YOU MAY THINK IT'S THE GREATEST WORLD VIEW THAT'S EVER BEEN CREATED
POD1000000023_S0000131	BUT IT WAS CREATED BY YOU BY A HUMAN BEING AND RODY WOULD SAY THAT ALTHOUGH WE OFTEN DECEIVE OURSELVES INTO THINKING IT'S THE TRUTH
POD1000000023_S0000132	REALLY WHAT WE'VE CREATED HERE IS WHAT HE CALLS A FINAL VOCABULARY
POD1000000023_S0000133	MORE ON FINAL VOCABULARIES IN ONE SECOND BUT FIRST I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HEAR RODY TALK ABOUT A KEY DISTINCTION BETWEEN SOMEONE SAYING THE WORLD IS OUT THERE AND SAYING THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE
POD1000000023_S0000134	AND HOW THESE STATEMENTS ULTIMATELY RELATE TO THE LANGUAGE WE USE HE SAYS QUOTE WE NEED TO MAKE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE CLAIM THAT THE WORLD IS OUT THERE AND THE CLAIM THAT THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE
POD1000000023_S0000135	TO SAY THAT THE WORLD IS OUT THERE THAT IT IS NOT OUR CREATION IS TO SAY WITH COMMON SENSE THAT MOST THINGS IN SPACE AND TIME ARE THE EFFECTS OF CAUSES WHICH DO NOT INCLUDE HUMAN MENTAL STATES
POD1000000023_S0000136	TO SAY THAT THE TRUTH IS NOT OUT THERE IS SIMPLY TO SAY THAT WHERE THERE ARE NO SENTENCES THERE IS NO TRUTH THAT SENTENCES ARE ELEMENTS OF HUMAN LANGUAGES
POD1000000023_S0000137	AND THAT HUMAN LANGUAGES ARE HUMAN CREATIONS TRUTH CANNOT BE OUT THERE IT CANNOT EXIST INDEPENDENTLY OF THE HUMAN MIND
POD1000000023_S0000138	BECAUSE SENTENCES CANNOT SO EXIST OR BE OUT THERE THE WORLD IS OUT THERE BUT DESCRIPTIONS OF THE WORLD ARE NOT
POD1000000023_S0000139	ONLY DESCRIPTIONS OF THE WORLD CAN BE TRUE OR FALSE THE WORLD ON ITS OWN UNAIDED BY THE DESCRIBING ACTIVITIES OF HUMAN BEINGS CANNOT END QUOTE
POD1000000023_S0000140	THIS IS ONE OF RODY'S MOST FAMOUS CONCEPTS WHAT MANY REFER TO AS THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN MAKING AND FINDING
POD1000000023_S0000141	LOCK AND KANT ARE NOT FINDING THE TRUTH ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS THEY'RE USING A VERY HUMAN PROCESS CALLED REASON TO MAKE A TRUTH ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS THAT WED THEN USE TO STRUCTURE OUR SOCIETIES
POD1000000023_S0000142	LIBERALISM WAS NOT FOUND TO BE THE BEST POLITICAL STRATEGY HISTORICAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND COMMON VALUES AMONG PEOPLE MADE IT THE BEST POLITICAL STRATEGY FOR A TIME
POD1000000023_S0000143	WHEN YOU READ A THOUSAND BOOKS YOU ARE NOT FINDING THE TRUTH ABOUT EXISTENCE YOU ARE MAKING A FINAL VOCABULARY THAT ALLOWS YOU TO INTERFACE WITH REALITY DURING THE SPECIFIC TIME THAT YOU HAPPEN TO BE LIVING
POD1000000023_S0000144	BY FINAL VOCABULARY RODY MEANS A COLLECTION OF STORIES METAPHORS NARRATIVES DISCOURSES TONS OF DIFFERENT TOOLS OF RHETORIC THAT YOU USE TO MAKE SENSE OF THE WORLD AND SEE YOUR PLACE IN IT
POD1000000023_S0000145	THIS IS CALLED A FINAL VOCABULARY BECAUSE THE THINGS THAT MAKE IT UP ARE OFTEN VERY FINAL THE FOUNDATIONS ARE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO DEVELOP ANY FURTHER BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT IF YOU ARE PRESSED HARD ENOUGH
POD1000000023_S0000146	TO EXPLAIN YOUR WORLDVIEW BY SOMEBODY SKILLED ENOUGH AT ARGUING WITH ENOUGH TIME ON THEIR HANDS ROADY SAYS THAT EVENTUALLY THERE WOULD BE NO WAY FOR YOU TO EXPLAIN WHY YOUR WORLD VIEW IS BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE'S IN A NONCIRCULAR WAY
POD1000000023_S0000147	IT IS A COURAGEOUS THING TO FIGHT AND DIE FOR YOUR COUNTRY BECAUSE LOOK FIGHTING AND DYING FOR YOUR COUNTRY IS LIKE ONE OF THE MOST COURAGEOUS THINGS YOU CAN DO THE BIBLE IS TRUE SO YOU SHOULD TRUST THE WORD OF GOD
POD1000000023_S0000148	WHEN PRESSED HARD ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY YOUR WORLD VIEW IN A CONVERSATION THESE ARE THE SORTS OF STORIES AND METAPHORS THAT GROUND THE VALUES OF SOMEONE THAT THINKS THEY'VE GOT IT ALL FIGURED OUT
POD1000000023_S0000149	WHEN THE MORE ACCURATE DESCRIPTION IS THAT THEY SET UP CAMP IN AN ECHO CHAMBER OF PEOPLE THAT DON'T CALL THEM ON THEIR MISTAKES
POD1000000023_S0000150	EITHER BECAUSE THEY ONLY TALK TO PEOPLE WHO MOSTLY AGREE WITH THEM ALREADY OR BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT DISAGREE WITH THEM THAT THEY ALLOW INTO THEIR CIRCLES LACK THE ABILITY TO PRESS THEM FURTHER MAYBE PEOPLE JUST WANT TO BE POLITE
POD1000000023_S0000151	MAYBE OTHER PEOPLE JUST DON'T CARE ENOUGH ABOUT CHANGING SOMEONE INTO A LITTLE VERSION OF THEM TO SPEND THEIR TIME DOING IT
POD1000000023_S0000152	RODY PRESCRIBES AN ANTIDOTE TO THIS WAY OF THINKING ABOUT GETTING PAST APPEARANCES TO THE REALITY OF THE WORLD HERE'S A PRETTY FAMOUS PASSAGE FROM HIS WORK THAT DESCRIBES HIS THREE CRITERIA FOR LIVING LIFE AS AN IRONIST
POD1000000023_S0000153	HE SAYS QUOTE I SHALL DEFINE AN IRONIST AS SOMEONE WHO FULFILLS THREE CONDITIONS
POD1000000023_S0000154	ONE SHE HAS RADICAL AND CONTINUING DOUBTS ABOUT THE FINAL VOCABULARY SHE CURRENTLY USES BECAUSE SHE HAS BEEN IMPRESSED BY OTHER VOCABULARIES VOCABULARIES TAKEN AS FINAL BY PEOPLE OR BOOKS SHE HAS ENCOUNTERED
POD1000000023_S0000155	TWO SHE REALIZES THAT ARGUMENT PHRASED IN HER PRESENT VOCABULARY CAN NEITHER UNDERWRITE NOR DISSOLVE THESE DOUBTS
POD1000000023_S0000156	THREE INSOFAR AS SHE PHILOSOPHIZES ABOUT HER SITUATION SHE DOES NOT THINK THAT HER VOCABULARY IS CLOSER TO REALITY THAN OTHERS THAT IT IS IN TOUCH WITH A POWER NOT HERSELF
POD1000000023_S0000157	IRONISTS WHO ARE INCLINED TO PHILOSOPHIZE SEE THE CHOICE BETWEEN VOCABULARIES AS MADE NEITHER WITHIN A NEUTRAL OR UNIVERSAL META VOCABULARY NOT BY AN ATTEMPT TO FIGHT ONE'S WAY PAST APPEARANCES TO THE REAL BUT SIMPLY BY PLAYING THE NEW OFF AGAINST THE OLD
POD1000000023_S0000158	END QUOTE SO IMAGINE LIVING LIFE AS AN IRONIST AS OPPOSED TO THIS OTHER TYPE OF PERSON WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT
POD1000000023_S0000159	YOU'D LIVE YOUR DAYTO DAY LIFE NOT LIKE PIRO FROM ANCIENT ATHENS YOU'RE NOT GON TO WALK IN FRONT OF CARS DOUBTING WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE ACTUALLY THERE YOU'D HAVE A SORT OF WORKING THEORY A FINAL VOCABULARY THAT YOU USE TO FUNCTION
POD1000000023_S0000160	THE DIFFERENCE WOULD BE THAT YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN OTHER FINAL VOCABULARIES SEEN THEIR WEAKNESSES
POD1000000023_S0000161	AND YOU'D REALIZE THAT YOURS IS PROBABLY EQUALLY AS FLAWED AS THEIRS IS IN SOME WAY BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE YOU HAVE SPECIAL ACCESS TO THE TRUTH
POD1000000023_S0000162	YOU DON'T HAVE A DEITY BACKING YOUR WORLD VIEW YOU DON'T HAVE SOME NEUTRAL POINT OUTSIDE OF CULTURE AND HISTORY THAT YOU'RE DOING YOUR THINKING FROM YOU ARE JUST AS FALLIBLE AS THEY ARE
POD1000000023_S0000163	AND YOUR CONCLUSIONS RELY ON HISTORY AND CULTURE JUST AS MUCH AS THEIRS DO YOU WOULD HAVE CONTINUING RADICAL DOUBT ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH REALITY
POD1000000023_S0000164	YOU'D ALSO REALIZE THAT ANY ATTEMPT BY YOU TO ARGUE THAT YOUR FINAL VOCABULARY IS SOMEHOW SUPERIOR TO OTHERS IS A POINTLESS EXERCISE AND IT'S ACTUALLY YOU ENGAGING IN THAT CIRCULAR REASONING WE WERE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE
POD1000000023_S0000165	BECAUSE THINK ABOUT IT YOU'RE ARGUING FOR A SET OF STORIES AND NARRATIVES AS BEING SUPERIOR BUT ALL THE WHILE YOU'RE USING THAT SET OF STORIES AND NARRATIVES AS THE PREMISE THAT YOU'RE STARTING YOUR ARGUMENTS FROM
POD1000000023_S0000166	THIS IS WHY ROIDY THINKS THAT WHEN IT COMES TO OUR FINAL VOCABULARIES ARGUING IN THE TRADITIONAL SENSE IS NOT A VERY EFFECTIVE WAY OF MAKING ANY PROGRESS AT ALL
POD1000000023_S0000167	RODY SAYS THAT AN IRONIST ALWAYS REALIZES THAT ANYTHING CAN BE MADE TO LOOK GOOD OR BAD BY BEING REDESCRIBED
POD1000000023_S0000168	BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S SOME SINGLE ARGUMENTATIVE STANDARD OUT THERE
POD1000000023_S0000169	WINNING AN ARGUMENT IN THE TIMES OF NAPOLEON IS JUST FAR DIFFERENT THAN WINNING AN ARGUMENT TODAY
POD1000000023_S0000170	BECAUSE THE VALUES OF THE PEOPLE JUDGING HAVE CHANGED THE HISTORICAL CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE CHANGED THE STORY ABOUT HOW THE WORLD FITS TOGETHER HAS CHANGED DIFFERENT ARGUMENTS ARE MORE EFFECTIVE IN DIFFERENT FINAL VOCABULARIES
POD1000000023_S0000171	SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO ARGUE WITH SOMEONE YOU ARE ALWAYS RELYING ON THE FACT THAT YOUR POINTS ARE GOING TO FIT WELL INTO THE FINAL VOCABULARY OF THE PERSON THAT YOU'RE ARGUING WITH WHICH IS FAR FROM A GUARANTEE
POD1000000023_S0000172	AND THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT IS THAT YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF CONSTANTLY ARGUING AGAINST A PARTICULAR COMMON FINAL VOCABULARY THAT HAPPENS TO DOMINATE THE CULTURE YOU WERE BORN INTO
POD1000000023_S0000173	BETTER TO INSTEAD LEAD BY EXAMPLE THROUGH IRONY WHEN SOMEONE THINKS THEY'VE LASSOED THE TRUTH WITH THEIR VOCABULARY THEY GOT IT
POD1000000023_S0000174	THE FAR MORE EFFECTIVE METHOD WILL ALWAYS BE TO DO WHAT RORDY CALLS IRONIC DISRUPTION WHICH DOESN'T MEAN YOU PULL OUT YOUR RICHARD RORDY HANDBOOK AND ARGUE THEM DOWN POINT BY POINT UNTIL THY SEE THE WORLD THE WAY THAT YOU DO
POD1000000023_S0000175	THE GOAL IS THROUGH ONE METHOD OR ANOTHER USUALLY RHETORICAL DEVICES
POD1000000023_S0000176	YOU TRY TO ALLOW THIS PERSON TO SEE ON THEIR OWN THE PERSPECTIVE FROM OUTSIDE THEIR SINGLE WORLD VIEW THE HOPE BEING THAT ONCE THEY'RE IN THIS PLACE THEY'LL REALIZE HOW LIMITING THEIR BASIC WAY OF VIEWING THE WORLD IS
POD1000000023_S0000177	BECAUSE IT COMPLETELY CLOSES THEM OFF FROM NEW WAYS OF CONNECTING WITH PEOPLE IDEAS AND THE WORLD THAT IS OUT THERE ONCE AGAIN THE WORLD THAT IS OUT THERE NOT THE TRUTH THAT IS OUT THERE
POD1000000023_S0000178	TO BE IN THIS PLACE STEPPING OUTSIDE OF YOUR WORLDVIEW AND SEEING A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY THE WORLD COULD BE RATIONALLY JUSTIFIED CAN BE TRANSFORMATIVE
POD1000000023_S0000179	SHOULD BE SAID THIS PROCESS ALSO BENEFITS THE IRONIST BECAUSE THEY NEED AS MUCH EXPERIENCE WITH FINAL VOCABULARIES AS THEY CAN GET THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO SPOT THESE FROM A MILE AWAY
POD1000000023_S0000180	RODY SAYS IN A PASSAGE THAT AN IRONIST IS NEVER QUITE ABLE TO TAKE THEMSELVES SERIOUSLY
POD1000000023_S0000181	BECAUSE THEY LIVED THEIR LIFE ACKNOWLEDGING HOW MUCH OF THEIR FINAL VOCABULARY WASN'T EVEN A CHOICE THEY CONSCIOUSLY MADE
POD1000000023_S0000182	AND THAT AT ANY POINT SOME OF THE ISSUES THEY BELIEVE IN MOST STRONGLY TODAY MIGHT TOMORROW CHANGE IN A SINGLE CONVERSATION
POD1000000023_S0000183	THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT APPROACH TO YOUR INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT AND A VERY DIFFERENT WAY OF APPROACHING CONVERSATIONS WITH PEOPLE THAT DISAGREE WITH YOU POLITICALLY
POD1000000023_S0000184	THIS PERSON WOULD SEEM LIKE AN ALIEN IN THE CURRENT POLITICAL LANDSCAPE BUT THIS IS ULTIMATELY THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT EMERGES IN A PLURALISTIC LANDSCAPE OF IDEAS RATHER THAN ONE THAT BELIEVES IN A SINGLE CORRECT ANSWER TO EVERY POLITICAL QUESTION
POD1000000023_S0000185	SO YOU MAY WONDER WHY BOTHER WHY EVEN SPEND A SECOND OF MY LIFE TRYING TO TALK TO SOMEBODY SHOWING THEM HOW THEY'RE LIMITING THEMSELVES TO A SINGLE ANSWER
POD1000000023_S0000186	LET THEM DO WHATEVER IT IS THEY'RE GOING TA DO BUT RODY WOULD SAY THAT THESE PEOPLE THAT TRULY BELIEVE THEY ARE READING BOOKS AND GETTING PAST THE WORLD OF APPEARANCES TO THE TRUE REALITY OF THINGS
POD1000000023_S0000187	THIS OUTDATED OVERSIMPLIFIED ATTITUDE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SO MUCH OF THE CRUELTY THAT GOES ON IN THIS WORLD
POD1000000023_S0000188	LIBERAL SOCIETY IN HIS EYES HAS A CONSTANT OBLIGATION TO REMIND OURSELVES OF THE WAYS THAT THE CURRENT ORDER OF THINGS MIGHT BE HURTING PEOPLE AROUND US MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE WHEN YOU HAVE A PLURALISTIC OUTLOOK
POD1000000023_S0000190	YOU KNOW THERE ARE RELATIVISTS OUT THERE THAT WOULD MAKE AN ARGUMENT THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD STOP FIGHTING OVER THEIR PETTY DISAGREEMENTS BECAUSE ULTIMATELY EVERYTHING IS ARBITRARY
POD1000000023_S0000191	THERE ARE CAPITAL R RATIONALISTS OUT THERE THAT'LL SAY EVERYONE SHOULD STOP FIGHTING BECAUSE WELL I'VE COME UP WITH THE RIGHT ANSWER I FOUND IT NO MORE WORK TO BE DONE
POD1000000023_S0000192	THE WAY RICHARD RORDY WALKS THIS LINE OF NATURE AND CULTURE IS PARTIALLY THROUGH HIS BEAUTIFUL USE OF PRAGMATISM UKOW RDY WOULDN'T SAY YOU SHOULD CARE LESS HE WOULDN'T SAY YOU SHOULD CARE MORE
POD1000000023_S0000193	WHAT HE WOULD SAY I THINK THOUGH IS THAT THE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT WE CARE ABOUT LIES IN SOLIDARITY AMONGST FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS
POD1000000023_S0000194	THAT SOLIDARITY IS WHAT KEEPS US IN LINE NOT A COSMIC LAW THAT SOLIDARITY IS WHAT DETERMINES OUR VALUES NOT SOME PHILOSOPHER UP IN A TOWER
POD1000000023_S0000195	TO UNDERSTAND THE HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL ENVIRONMENT THAT YOU LIVE IN IS ONLY THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS UNDERSTANDING THE SOLIDARITY THAT HOLDS SOCIETY TOGETHER
POD1000000023_S0000196	HE SAID IT WELL WHEN DESCRIBING ONE OF HIS BOOKS HERE IND ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS PASSAGES FROM ANY OF HIS WORK
POD1000000023_S0000197	HE SAYS QUOTE THE FUNDAMENTAL PREMISE OF THIS BOOK IS THAT A BELIEF CAN STILL REGULATE ACTION CAN STILL BE WORTH DYING FOR AMONG PEOPLE WHO ARE QUITE AWARE THAT THIS BELIEF IS CAUSED BY NOTHING MORE THAN CONTINGENT HISTORICAL CIRCUMSTANCES
POD1000000023_S0000198	END QUOTE
POD1000000023_S0000199	THANK YOU FOR LISTENING I'LL TALK TO YOU NEXT TIME
POD1000000024_S0000000	I DREADED DOING THE SHOW SOMETIMES BECAUSE WHATEVER IT WAS

POD1000000024_S0000002	YEAH FEELINGS TEFEELINGS
POD1000000024_S0000003	I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAD SORT OF AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AT THAT POINT THAT THINGS WERE STRAINED BETWEEN US
POD1000000024_S0000004	UT WE WERE DEFINITELY NOT AS CLOSE AS WE HAD ONCE BEEN BY THE TIME THAT THAT WAS HAPPENING
POD1000000024_S0000005	AND PART OF THIS PERIOD OF TIME IS ABOUT THE WEIRD DUALITY BETWEEN BECOMING RECOGNIZED AS FRIENDS MORE PUBLICLY
POD1000000024_S0000006	EVEN AS WE WERE SPENDING LESS TIME IN THAT KIND OF INTIMATE COMMUNICATION THAT REALLY MAKES A FRIENDSHIP FEEL SAFE AND SECURE
POD1000000024_S0000007	I DON'T KNOW DOES THAT FEEL RIGHT TO YOU SORRY
POD1000000024_S0000008	FEEL SO RIGHT PLEASE BE MY SPOKESPERSON FOR EVERYTHING THANK YOU

POD1000000024_S0000014	ANNE FRIEDMAN IS A JOURNALIST WHOSE WRITING HAS BEEN IN PLACES LIKE THE NEW YORK TIMES L AND THE GUARDIAN
POD1000000024_S0000015	THEY'VE BEEN BEST FRIENDS SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINE BUT FOR MOST OF THAT TIME THEY'VE LIVED ON OPPOSITE COASTS
POD1000000024_S0000016	IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THEY STARTED CO HOSTING THE PODCAST CALL YOUR GIRLFRIEND WHOSE TAG LINE IS A PODCAST FOR LONG DISTANCE BESTIES EVERYWHERE
POD1000000024_S0000017	IT GETS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF LISTENERS
POD1000000024_S0000018	THEY RECORD IT FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE HOMES JUST LIKE THEY DID FOR THE INTERVIEW FOR THIS EPISODE
POD1000000024_S0000019	BUT MAINTAINING A FRIENDSHIP ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND ACROSS A PROFESSIONAL COLLABORATION HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN EASY
POD1000000024_S0000020	THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM TURNED INTO EMOTIONAL DISTANCE AND THEY HAD TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO RECONNECT
POD1000000024_S0000021	THEY'VE CO WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT IT CLLED BIG FRIENDSHIP WHICH COMES OUT IN JULY
POD1000000024_S0000022	BUT THAT PROJECT IS JUST THE NEXT CHAPTER IN THEIR STORY WHICH STARTED OVER A DECADE AGO
POD1000000024_S0000023	HERE'S AMINATU
POD1000000024_S0000025	ANNE AND I MET AT A GOSSIP GIRL VIEWING PARTY IN WASHINGTON D C IN TWO THOUSAND NINE
POD1000000024_S0000026	GOSSIP CRIRL WAS IMPORTANT THEN IT IS STILL IMPORTANT TODAY
POD1000000024_S0000028	THAT PARTY WAS HOSTED BY OUR MUTUAL FRIEND DAIO
POD1000000024_S0000029	SHE SPECIFICALLY INVITED BOTH OF US TO THAT PARTY HAVING ALREADY IDENTIFIED THAT WE WOULD PROBABLY GET ALONG AND BE FRIENDS
POD1000000024_S0000030	IN THE SAME WAY THAT SOMEONE WOULD LIKE SET YOU UP ON A BLIND DATE ROMANTICALLY
POD1000000024_S0000031	THIS WAS LIKE A FRIENDSHIP LIKE SETUP
POD1000000024_S0000032	I DO REMEMBER JUST FEELING LIKE EVERY COMMENT AND EVERY JOKE AND EVERY LITTLE LIKE ASIDE OR CONTRIBUTION SHE MADE TO THE KIND OF META CONVERSATION HAPPENING ABOUT THE TV SHOW WAS JUST SPOT ON
POD1000000024_S0000033	AND JUST BEING LIKE I COULD BE HERE FOREVER AND LISTEN TO EVERY SINGLE WORD THAT COMES OUT OF THIS WOMAN'S MOUTH
POD1000000024_S0000034	I JUST REALLY LIKED YOUR OUTFIT ANNE
POD1000000024_S0000035	WOW
POD1000000024_S0000036	WAS LIKE YES FINALLY A GOOD OUTFIT IN THIS TOWN
POD1000000024_S0000037	LIKE I REMEMBER THAT BEING REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME
POD1000000024_S0000038	BUT I JUST REMEMBER REALLY APPRECIATING THAT THIS PERSON WAS BOTH LIKE HILARIOUS AND ALSO SMART
POD1000000024_S0000039	AND THEN MUCH LATER WHEN I CONNECTED THE DOTS TO THE FACT THAT OH YOU WERE THE ANN FRIEDMAN WHOSE BIYELINE I HAD READ BEFORE I WAS LIKE GREAT
POD1000000024_S0000040	EVERYTHING MAKES SENSE NOW OF COURSE
POD1000000024_S0000041	THIS WOMAN WHO WEARS THIS GEANS AND T SHIRTS SITUATION SO PERFECTLY ALSO HAS LIKE TEN OUT OF TEN TASTES IN TEEN TELEVIS
POD1000000024_S0000042	SO YOU KNOW IT WORKED OUT REALLY WELL FOR ME
POD1000000024_S0000043	IT JUST WAS EASY RIGHT AWAY
POD1000000024_S0000044	AND SO THINGS ESCALATED LIKE VERY FAST
POD1000000024_S0000045	WE REALLY WENT ZERO TO A HUNDRED IN LIKE THE FIRST COUPLE MONTHS
POD1000000024_S0000046	WHEN I PICTURE THIS TIME IN OUR LIVES I JUST PICTURE US SPENDING DOZENS OF HOURS ON ONE OF OUR COUCHES
POD1000000024_S0000047	WE JUST SPEND SO MANY HOURS DOING NOTHING
POD1000000024_S0000048	DIN THAT WAY IT FELT VERY MUCH LIKE A COLLEGE OR A TEEM FRIENDSHIP TO ME
POD1000000024_S0000049	OUR TWENTY S WERE VERY MUCH MARKED BY A LOT OF LIKE BIG GROUP HANKGS YOU KNOW
POD1000000024_S0000050	BUT I THINK THAT FOR ME THAT WHEN I KNEW THAT WE WERE GOING TO BE FRIENDS FOR A LONG TIME IS WHEN IT WAS OK TO BE LIKE ACTUALLY I DON'T WANT TO BE DOING AT
POD1000000024_S0000051	I JUST WANT TO BE TAKING OUR BRAWS OFF ON THE COUCH AND JUST TALKING ABOUT MUNDANE STUFF OR LIKE READING SIDE BY SIDE LIKE NOT REALLY SAYING ANYTHING TO EACH OTHER
POD1000000024_S0000052	I HAD BEEN LIVING WITH A BOYFRIEND AND WE BROKE UP WHEN YOU AND I HAD BEEN FRIENDS FOR SIX MONTHS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
POD1000000024_S0000053	AND THEN WHEN I WENT TO REVISE MY H R PAPERWORK AT WORK LIKE WHO IS YOUR NEXT OF KIN OR WHATEVER THEY MAKE YOU PUT DOWN FOR WORK EMERGENCIES
POD1000000024_S0000054	AT THAT POINT IT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT IT WAS YOU
POD1000000024_S0000055	YEAH BY THAT POINT YOU WERE SOMEONE IN MY LIFE WHO I WAS LIKE YES LIKE GIVE HER MY FOURO ONE K
POD1000000024_S0000056	LIKE PLEASE CALL HER IF I SLIP ON A BANANA AT WORK
POD1000000024_S0000058	TISIS THE ONLY CAPABLE PERSON IN MY LIFE THANK YOU
POD1000000024_S0000059	YOUR JOB AT THE BANANA FACTORY
POD1000000024_S0000061	THE PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW
POD1000000024_S0000063	IF I'M FOUND IN A DITCH SOMEWHERE I HOPE THAT MY PHONE LITERALLY SAYS PLEASE CALL ANNE FREEDMAN
POD1000000024_S0000065	BUT WE HAVE NOW BEEN FRIENDS WHO LIVE APART FOR MUCH LONGER THAN WE WERE FRIENDS WHO LIVED IN THE SAME CITY
POD1000000024_S0000066	I KNEW THAT EVENTUALLY YOU WOULD MOVE BECAUSE WE LIVED IN A VERY TRANSITIONAL KIND OF CITY
POD1000000024_S0000067	AND WE HAD TALKED ABOUT IT AND IT WAS LIKE THE GREAT RECESSION LIKE PEOPLE MOVE TO GO TO JOBS LIKE ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY
POD1000000024_S0000068	IT WAS NOT LIKE IT WAS A SURPRISE THAT ONE OF US WOULD HAVE TO MOVE
POD1000000024_S0000069	IT JUST FELL TOO SOON
POD1000000024_S0000070	YEAH AND IT'S FUNNY WHEN I THINK ABOUT MAKING THAT DECISION IT WAS SO WRAPPED UP IN WORK FOR ME
POD1000000024_S0000071	LIKE EVEN THOUGH OBVIOUSLY I WAS PHYSICALLY LEAVING LIKE OUR ABILITY TO SPEND ALL THESE HOURS ON THE COUCH TOGETHER
POD1000000024_S0000072	I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE OUR FRIENDSHIP WAS GOING TO END OR EVEN BE EXISTENTIALLY THREATENED BY THE FACT THAT I WAS MOVING AWAY
POD1000000024_S0000073	AND THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT I WASN'T SAD ABOUT IT OR THAT IT WAS EASY
POD1000000024_S0000074	IT'S JUST AT THE TIME IT REALLY JUST FELT LIKE OKA LIKE WE 'RE GOING TO BE AS CLOSE AS WE EVER WERE
POD1000000024_S0000075	IT'S JUST GOINGTO LOOK A LITTLE DIFFERENT
POD1000000024_S0000076	I WAS DEVASTATED WHEN YOU MOVED AWAY ANNE AND I REMEMBER VERY CONSCIOUSLY HAVING TO MAKE A CHOICE OF LIKE I WILL NEVER SHOW THIS PERSON THAT I AM BUMMED OUT BY THIS
POD1000000024_S0000077	BECAUSE I KNEW JUST HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS FOR YOU AND I WAS ALSO REALLY EXCITED FOR YOU THAT YOU WERE ACTUALLY ON A PATH TO DO SOMETHING THAT YOU WANTED TO DO
POD1000000024_S0000078	I DON'T SHINE IF YOU DON'T SHINE IS SOMETHING THAT AMINA FIRST SAID TO ME AND THEN WE WOULD SAY TO EACH OTHER
POD1000000024_S0000079	MOSTLY I THINK AS AN ASSURANCE WHEN ONE OF US WAS WORRIED SHE WAS TAKING UP TOO MUCH SPACE IN THE OTHER'S BRAIN OR LIFE OR WHATEVER
POD1000000024_S0000080	MAYBE ASKING FOR TOO MUCH SUPPORT OR HELP A WAY OF REASSURING EACH OTHER THAT WE WERE INVESTED IN EACH OTHER
POD1000000024_S0000081	AND I DON'T SHINE IF YOU DON'T SHINE WAS THE ASSURANCE THAT UNDERPINNED A LOT OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS
POD1000000024_S0000082	I HAVE ALWAYS FELT THAT COLLABORATION IS BETTER THAN COMPETITION
POD1000000024_S0000083	EVERY SUCCESS IN MY LIFE IS A TESTAMENT TO THAT
POD1000000024_S0000084	AND SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE WE STARTED CALLING IT SHINE THEORY PRIVATELY
POD1000000024_S0000085	AND THEN IN TWENTY THIRTEEN I WAS A COLUMNIST FOR THE CUT AND WROTE ABOUT IT IN A COLUMN
POD1000000024_S0000086	AND LOTS OF PEOPLE READ AND SHARED THE COLUMN AND THEN IT BECAME A LOT BIGGER THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED
POD1000000024_S0000087	BUT LIKE ALL THINGS THAT GO VIRAL THERE ARE ALSO A LOT OF COMPLICATIONS WHERE YOU'RE LIKE GREAT IS EVERYONE REALLY ON THE SAME PAGE ABUT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
POD1000000024_S0000088	I REMEMBER MUCH TO MY SURPRISE AND HORROR SHINE THEORY DOT COM HAD ALREADY BEEN BOUGHT
POD1000000024_S0000089	A WOMAN WHO RAN A FITNESS STUDIO WAS USING IT TO PUSH SOME SORT OF LIKE MISSFITNESS STUDIO CONTEST
POD1000000024_S0000090	MY NAME WAS ON THE WEBSITE
POD1000000024_S0000091	AND SO A LAWYER WAS HIRED
POD1000000024_S0000092	AND I THINK THAT HAVING TO GO THROUGH THIS EXPERIENCE WITH YOU ANN LIKE I MAKE DECISIONS DIFFERENTLY WHEN I'M MAKING DECISIONS WITH SOMEONE THAN I DO IF I'M MAKING THEM FOR MYSELF
POD1000000024_S0000093	YOU REALLY LEARN THAT LIKE PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT APPETITES FOR NEGOTIATION
POD1000000024_S0000094	LIKE PEOPLE HAVE YOU KNOW LIKE A DIFFERENT STYLE THAT THEY WANT TO BE COMBATTIVE OR NOT COMBATIVE IN AND WHATEVER
POD1000000024_S0000095	I THINK THAT HAVING TO SORT OUT A LOT OF THOSE KANKS THROUGH THIS PROCESS ILLUMINATED A LOT OF THINGS
POD1000000024_S0000096	AND YOU KNOW LIKE ONE OF THEM BEING LIKE OKY THIS REALLY SUCKS BUT I REALLY LIKE THE PERSON I HAVE TO DO THIS WITH
POD1000000024_S0000097	IT WAS IMPORTANT TO ME THAT WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE A DECISION THIS BIG TOGETHER
POD1000000024_S0000098	YOU KNOW WHEN IT WAS LIKE THAT WAS NOT FALLING APART
POD1000000024_S0000099	THE POINT AT WHICH WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE SHINE THEORY TRADEMARK WAS ACTUALLY SEVERAL MONTHS OR MAYBE EVEN DRAGGED OUT FOR LIKE MORE THAN A YEAR
POD1000000024_S0000100	AND THAT PERIOD OF TIME I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAD SORT OF AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AT THAT POINT THAT THINGS WERE STRAINED BETWEEN US
POD1000000024_S0000101	UT WE WERE DEFINITELY NOT AS CLOSE AS WE HAD ONCE BEEN BY THE TIME THAT THAT WAS HAPPENING
POD1000000024_S0000102	I THINK THAT WEARE ENTERING INTO A PERIOD WHERE A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE WERE COMPARTMENTALIZING WERE STARTING TO BECOME PROBLEMS YOU KNOW
POD1000000024_S0000103	LIKE WE WERE BOTH CHANGING AND GOING THROUGH REALLY HARD THINGS IN OUR OWN LIVES VERY FAR APART PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY IN MOST CASES
POD1000000024_S0000104	AND I THINK FOR ME ALSO LIKE THIS HAS BEEN THE CENTRAL THE LESSON THAT I AM LEARNING AS AS I GROW UP EVERY DAY
POD1000000024_S0000105	PEOPLE ARE CHANGING CONSTANTLY
POD1000000024_S0000106	AND IT IS REALLY HARD TO DO A CHECK IN EVERY DAY AND REALIZE THAT YOU ARE DIFFERENT THAN YOU WERE YESTERDAY
POD1000000024_S0000107	AND SO I THINK THAT EVEN IF WE WERE LIKE LIVING IN THE SAME CITY OR WE YOU KNOW LIKE BOUGHT A HOUSE TOGETHER AND WE WERE ROOMMATES OR WHATEVER I STILL THINK THAT WE WOULD WE WOULD BE TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE
POD1000000024_S0000108	CLINGING ON TO AN IDEA OF WHO I THINK SOMEONE IS IS VERY REASSURING
POD1000000024_S0000109	BUT IN THAT LIKE YOU DON'T GIVE PEOPLE ROOM TO CHANGE THEIR MINDS OR TO EXPLORE NEW THINGS OR TO DO NEW THINGS AND SO
POD1000000024_S0000110	WE WERE DIFFERENT AND WE DIDN'T ACKNOWLEDGE IT AT THE BEGINNING AND THEN WE WERE CHANGING AND DIDN'T REALIZE THAT WE WERE CHANGING
POD1000000024_S0000111	AND THERE WAS SO MUCH TO ACCOUNT FOR IN THAT GAP
POD1000000024_S0000112	AND SO FOR EACH OF US DECIDING TO SHARE LESS OF OURSELVES WAS SOMETIMES A CONSCIOUS AND SOMETIMES A TOTALLY UNCONSCIOUS REFLEXIVE DECISION
POD1000000024_S0000113	YET WE HAD ALL OF THIS COMMUNICATION RELATED TO HOSTING A PODCAST TOGETHER
POD1000000024_S0000114	FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS THE ONLY PODCAST THAT I LISTENED TO WAS THIS AMERICAN LIFE
POD1000000024_S0000115	SO IT NEVER EVEN OCCURRED TO ME THAT IT WAS SOMETHING WE COULD DO
POD1000000024_S0000116	BUT I HAD MET GINA DELVAK OUR PRODUCER THROUGH ANNE AND SOME OF ANNE'S FRIENDS IN LA AND AT SOME POINT SOMEWHERE IN PALM SPRINGS
POD1000000024_S0000117	LIKE BETWEEN PROBABLY DRUGS AND WINE FOR ME IT WAS SUGGESTG THATWE COULD DO A PODCAST
POD1000000024_S0000118	I THINK SHE WAS JUST LIKE YOU GUYS HAVE GOOD CHEMISTRY AND YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT DOING THIS
POD1000000024_S0000119	AND IAM ALSO PRETTY SURE WE SAID THAT STANDARD THING THAT I HEAR MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE WOMEN SAY WHEN YOU SUGGEST THEY RECORD THEMSELVES WHICH IS I HATE MY VOICE WHY WOULD I DO THAT OR SOMETHING LIKE TAT
POD1000000024_S0000120	YOU KNOW I'M PRETTY SURE WE WERE KIND OF DISMISSIVE BUT THEN ALSO THAT WE THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND TALKED ABOUT IT AND
POD1000000024_S0000121	SEVERAL WEEKS LATER
POD1000000024_S0000122	DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE IN THE CAR AND YOU BOUGHT THE URL ON YOUR PHONE
POD1000000024_S0000123	YES WE CAME UP WITH THE NAME IN THE CAR
POD1000000024_S0000124	I CONFESS THAT IF I HAD REALLY SAT THERE AND THOUGHT FOR LONGER THAN THIRTY SECONDS THE SHOW PROBABLY WOULD NOT BE CALLE CALL YOUR GIRLFRIEND
POD1000000024_S0000125	IT WOULD BE CALLED SOMETHING ELSE
POD1000000024_S0000126	INDEED
POD1000000024_S0000127	THIS IS HOW WE WORK
POD1000000024_S0000128	NOTHING IS REAL UNLESS THERE IS A WEBSITE
POD1000000024_S0000129	NOTHING IS REAL UNLESS YOU'VE HAD A MEETING ABOUT IT
POD1000000024_S0000130	AND GINA HAD DONE ALL OF THE WORK TO SAY THIS IS WHAT WE THINK IT COULD BE
POD1000000024_S0000131	AND BECAUSE SHE DID THAT IT MADE ME FEEL LIKE WE COULD ACTUALLY DO IT
POD1000000024_S0000132	WE DIDN'T THINK THAT TONS OF STRANGERS WOULD LISTEN TO IT
POD1000000024_S0000133	I THINK THAT LIKE A HUGE PART OF THE SHOW'S SUCCESS HONESTLY IS THAT WE BACKED INTO ALL OF THESE THINGS
POD1000000024_S0000134	IF THEY HAD COME TO ME AND SAID HEY DO YOU WANT TO RUN A SMALL MEDIA COMPANY WHERE WE HAVE TO GET A GOVERNMENT EIN AND WE HAVE TO DO PAYROLE
POD1000000024_S0000135	I WOULD HAVE SAID ABSOLUTELY NOT PLEASE NEVER SPEAK TO ME AGAIN THIS IS NOT WHAT I WANT TO DO
POD1000000024_S0000136	AND IT SOUNDS LIKE A REALLY DUMB THING TO SAY NOW BUT IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME THAT PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT OUR FRIENDS WOULD LISTEN TO IT
POD1000000024_S0000137	HI WELCOME TO CALL YOUR GIRLFRIEND
POD1000000024_S0000138	A PODCAST FOR LONG DISTANCE BESTIE'S EVERYWHERE
POD1000000024_S0000139	USUALLY WE ARE LONG DISTANCE VESTIES BUT TODAY WE ARE IN THE SAME ROOM
POD1000000024_S0000140	I KNOW WE'RE CHEATING AND I LOVE I
POD1000000024_S0000141	BUT I DREADED DOING THE SHOW SOMETIMES BECAUSE WHATEVER IT WAS
POD1000000024_S0000142	FEELING
POD1000000024_S0000143	EA FEELING
POD1000000024_S0000144	WHEN WE ARE NOT COMMUNICATING WELL AND YOU ADD DISTANCE TO IT LIKE THAT WAS AN ISSUE
POD1000000024_S0000145	ORE ALWAYS THINKING LIKE OKY WE'LL DEAL WITH THIS LATER
POD1000000024_S0000146	THERE WAS ALWAYS LIKE A THING YOU KNOW LIKE A SMALL THING THAT YOU WOULD DEAL WITH LATER AND THEN THAT JAR GOT FULL AND YOU'RE LIKE OH THIS IS A LOT OF STUFF
POD1000000024_S0000147	AND IT HAPPENED IN SO MANY LITTLE WAYS THAT WE DIDN'T REALLY EVEN FULLY ACKNOWLEDGE IT UNTIL THINGS HAD GOTTEN REALLY BAD
POD1000000024_S0000148	AND I THINK PART OF THIS PERIOD OF TIME IS ABOUT THE WEIRD DUALITY BETWEEN BECOMING RECOGNIZED AS FRIENDS MORE PUBLICLY
POD1000000024_S0000149	EVEN AS WE WERE SPENDING LESS TIME IN THAT KIND OF INTIMATE COMMUNICATION THAT REALLY MAKES A FRIENDSHIP FEEL SAFE AND SECURE
POD1000000024_S0000150	I DON'T KNOW DOES THAT FEEL RIGHT TO YOU SORRY
POD1000000024_S0000152	FEEL SO RIGHT PLEASE BE MY SPOKESPERSON FOR EVERYTHING THANK YOU
POD1000000024_S0000154	THERE WAS SORT OF THIS ILLUSION THAT WE WERE STILL IN TOUCH IN THE SAME WAY WE HAD ALWAYS BEEN
POD1000000024_S0000155	EVEN THOUGH WE WEREN'T ACTUALLY TALKING IN LIKE TRULY INTIMATE WAYS ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN EACH OF OUR LIVES
POD1000000024_S0000156	WE WERE KIND OF TALKING ABOUT LOGISTICAL THINGS FOR WORK OR WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE NEWS OR POP CULTURE ON THE PODCAST
POD1000000024_S0000157	YOU KNOW THE KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS THAT REALLY UNDERPINNED OUR RELATIONSHIP IN THE BEGINNING JUST WEREN'T HAPPENING ANYMORE WITH THE SAME FREQUENCY
POD1000000024_S0000158	I KNEW THAT WE WEREN'T DOING WELL BUT I KNEW THAT YOU DIDN'T HATE ME
POD1000000024_S0000159	THE THING THAT WAS HARD ABOUT OUR CONFLICT IS THAT WE LOVED EACH OTHER BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER
POD1000000024_S0000160	I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT THE WORDS WERE THAT YOU SAID IN THAT CONVERSATION BUT I JUST REMEMBER THE RELIEF I FELT WHEN YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU DIDN'T FEEL GOOD
POD1000000024_S0000161	I FEEL AWFUL I THINK I'S WHAT
POD1000000024_S0000163	
POD1000000024_S0000166	SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SCARY MOMENT
POD1000000024_S0000167	SHOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE OH NO AND INSTEAD I WAS LIKE THANK GOD FINALLY LIKE IT'S ALL ON THE TABLE
POD1000000024_S0000168	AND I REMEMBER JUST FEELING THIS HUGE SENSE OF RELIEF OF GREAT WE ARE HAVING A BREAKDOWN AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT I LOVE IT
POD1000000024_S0000169	ANDSO THAT'S HOW WE ENDED UP A COUPLE'S THERAPY
POD1000000024_S0000170	DOESN'T IT FEEL GOOD TO LAUGH ABOUT THIS NOW
POD1000000024_S0000171	LIKE OH EXPENSIVE EVERY LAUGH IS THE SOUND OF THOUSANDS OF THERAPY DOLLARS
POD1000000024_S0000173	WE WOULD LIKE I DON'T KNOW RECORD THE PODCAST AND THEN YOU KNOW LIKE HANG UP THAT EQUIPMENT AND BE LIKE WELLE ARE YOU READY TO GO TO DR SO ANSO LATER
POD1000000024_S0000174	SHOW UP TO THERAPY DO THAT REALLY HARD WORK AND ALSO SOMETIMES LIKE AGREE OR DISAGREE WITH THE THERAPIST AND BE ABLE TO TALK TO EACH OTHER ABOUT IT
POD1000000024_S0000175	THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THAT THAT FELT LIKE SUCH AN OUT OF BODY EXPERIENCE TO ME WHERE I WAS LIKE AM I REALLY THIS GROWN UP
POD1000000024_S0000176	LIKE I WORKED WITH THIS PERSON WE ARE NOW AT OUR THERAPIST AND NOW WE'RE GONGNA GO HOME AND LAY ON THE FLOOR BECAUSE THIS WAS SO HARD
POD1000000024_S0000177	IF YOU HAD NOT BEEN AT THOSE THERAPY SESSIONS WITH ME I WOULD NOT BELIEVE THAT IT HAD HAPPENED
POD1000000024_S0000178	BUT IT DID HAPPEN AND SOMEHOW WE DID IT
POD1000000024_S0000179	RIGHT WE BOTH STILL WANTED TO BE THERE
POD1000000024_S0000180	AND LIKE I THINK ABOUT THAT SAYING ABOUT LIKE HOW DO YOU STAY MARRIED YOU JUST DON'T GET DIVORCED OR WHATEVER I DON'T KNOW
POD1000000024_S0000181	BUT I WILL SAY THAT LIKE WE WERE BOTH CONTINUING TO SHOW UP
POD1000000024_S0000182	IN OUR FRIENDSHIP I'VE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT BEING SOMEONE WHO WHO DOESN'T RUN AWAY FROM THEIR COMMITMENTS
POD1000000024_S0000183	WE FELT LIKE THIS EXPERIENCE WE HAD HAD TRYING TO REPAIR AN INTIMATE FRIENDSHIP THAT HAD LIKE HIT THE ROCKS IS NOT SOMETHING WE SAW REFLECTED ANYWHERE
POD1000000024_S0000184	AN SO THERE WAS A MOTIVATION I THINK TO TRY TO PUT SOME OF THIS DOWN IN WORDS
POD1000000024_S0000185	I THINK WE STARTED TO TALK ABOUT WRITING A BOOK PROPOSAL IN MAYBE TWENTY SEVENTEEN DOES THAT SOUND RIGHT
POD1000000024_S0000186	YEAH WHEN IT CAME TO AUDIO NEITHER OF US KNEW WHAT WE WERE DOING AND IT WAS VERY MUCH LIKE OKAY GREAT LIKE WE'RE STARTING FROM SCRATCH
POD1000000024_S0000187	AND WITH THIS YOU KNOW ANN IS A WRITER
POD1000000024_S0000188	AND I'M HER FRIEND BUT I'M ALSO HER FAN
POD1000000024_S0000189	LIKE I'VE READ ANNE FOR YEARS
POD1000000024_S0000190	AND SO I WAS REALLY THINKING ABOUT LIKE HOW IS THIS COLLABORATION GOING TO WORK
POD1000000024_S0000191	WE SOLD THIS BOOK AS LIKE WE ARE TWO COEQUAL AUTHORS AND I WAS LIKE GREAT
POD1000000024_S0000192	I'M LIKE PARED UP WITH AN OLYMPIAN AND NOW WE HAVE TO DO HURDLES
POD1000000024_S0000194	YOU KNOW A LOT OF BOOKS THAT ARE CO WRITTEN
POD1000000024_S0000195	YOU KNOW IN THIS FIFTY FIFTY WAY HAVE YOU KNOW CHAPTER ONE'S BY ONE PERSON AND THEN CHAPTER TWO'S BY THE OTHER PERSON AND THEY KIND OF VOLLY BACK AND FORTH
POD1000000024_S0000196	AND WE MADE A CHOICE PRETTY EARLY ON THAT WE WANTED TO HAVE ONE NARRATIVE
POD1000000024_S0000197	AND SO AS A PROJECT IT IS REALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DISENTANGLE OUR VARIOUS INPUTS
POD1000000024_S0000198	AND I DON'T KNOW I FEEL LIKE THAT FEELS TRUER TO ME IN THE SENSE OF LIKE THAT'S REALLY WHAT A FRIENDSHIP FEELS LIKE
POD1000000024_S0000199	AND THE WAY WE DID THAT IS WE OUTLINED TOGETHER QUITE MAETICULOUSLY AND THEN WE WOULD TAKE A SECTION OF THE OUTLINE SPLIT UP
POD1000000024_S0000200	WE'D EACH WRITE NARRATIVELY THAT SECTION OF THE OUTLINE ON OUR SEPARATE COMPUTERS AND THEN WE WOULD EACH READ ALOUD WHAT WE HAD WRITTEN TO THE OTHER
POD1000000024_S0000201	AND THEN WE WOULD KNIT THEM TOGETHER AND KEEP THE BEST PARTS OF BOTH AND THEN MOVE ON TO THE NEXT SECTION OF THE OUTLINE FOR SEVENTY THOUSAND WORDS
POD1000000024_S0000202	WOW

POD1000000026_S0000005	I MEAN M
POD1000000026_S0000006	WDVE ASKED FOR CLARIFICATION
POD1000000026_S0000008	MIKE CREGER WAS CO FOUNDER AND FORMER CEO OF INSTAGRAM
POD1000000026_S0000009	I'M KEVIN SISTRAM FORMER CEO AND CO FOUNDER OF INSTAGRAM
POD1000000026_S0000011	KEVIN SISTREM AND MIKE KREGER COFOUNDED INSTAGRAM IN TWO THOUSAND TEN
POD1000000026_S0000012	A YEAR AND A HALF LATER THEY SOLD IT TO FACEBOOK FOR A BILLION DOLLARS
POD1000000026_S0000013	THEY STAYED ON TO RUN THE COMPANY FOR ANOTHER SIX YEARS
POD1000000026_S0000014	AND THEN IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THEY LEFT TOGETHER
POD1000000026_S0000015	AND EVEN NOW THEY STILL WORK TOGETHER
POD1000000026_S0000016	THE FIRST TIME THEY MET THOUGH THEY HAD NO IDEA THAT IT WULD LEAD TO SOMETHING SO MEANINGFUL
POD1000000026_S0000017	IN FACT KEVIN DOESN'T EVEN REMEMBER THAT FIRST TIME THEY MET
POD1000000026_S0000019	I'D LIKE TO SAY I DO I REALLY DON'T
POD1000000026_S0000020	THE FIRST TIME I REMEMBER MEETING MIKE WAS IN COFFEE BAR THE SMALL CAFE IN SAN FRANCISCO
POD1000000026_S0000021	IT BECAME MY GO TO OFFICE BECAUSE I HAD LEFT MY JOB AND I WAS WORKING ON THIS APP CALLED URBAN
POD1000000026_S0000022	AND IT WAS JUST ME
POD1000000026_S0000023	I KNEW OF MIKE I HAD SEEN HIM LIKE WE'RE IN THE SAME CIRCLES
POD1000000026_S0000024	AND I RECOGNIZED MIKE AND I WALKED OVER TO SAY HELLO
POD1000000026_S0000025	BUT THE FIRST THING I NOTICED WAS THE THING HE WAS WORKING
POD1000000026_S0000026	S LIKE THIS BEAUTIFUL WEBSITE
POD1000000026_S0000027	AND I DIDN'T REALIZE HE WAS WORKING WITH HE DESIGNE
POD1000000026_S0000028	SO ANYWAY IN MY MIND MIKE WAS LIKE THIS AMAZING DESIGNER
POD1000000026_S0000029	LITTLE DID I KNOW THAT ACTUALLY HE WAS AN AMAZING ENGINNEER
POD1000000026_S0000031	DON'T KNOW THAT YOU'VE EVER TOUCHED PHOTOSHOP ACTUALLY
POD1000000026_S0000033	AAY THAT'S NONT TRUE
POD1000000026_S0000034	I BUILT THE SHUTTER ON THE VERY FIRST VERSION OF INSTAGRAM AND IT WAS VERY BASIC
POD1000000026_S0000035	WASN'T THE SHUTTER LITERALLY JUST TWO GREY SLIDERS THAT JUST CLOSED AND OPEND
POD1000000026_S0000036	
POD1000000026_S0000038	WAS NOT THAT WAS NOT THAT GOOD HONESTLY
POD1000000026_S0000040	BUT THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I REMEMBER HANGING OUT WITH YOU BECAUSE I REMEMBER BEING SO IMPRESSED
POD1000000026_S0000041	AND I ASKED YOU WHAT TOOL YOU WERE USING
POD1000000026_S0000042	AND I DON'T REMEMBER THE TOOL BUT I REMEMBER USING IT AND JUST BEING LIKE OH MAN LIKE
POD1000000026_S0000043	I'S SO GOOD TO HAVE LIKE A MICE IN YOUR LIFE WHERE YOU CAN ASK THEM A QUESTION THEY JUST ALWAYS HAVE THE BEST ANSWER
POD1000000026_S0000044	TURNS OUT YEARS LATER I STILL FEEL LIKE THAT'S TRUE
POD1000000026_S0000045	I REMEMBER THINKING OH HERE'S SOMEBODY WHO'S ACTUALLY LIKE PURSUING SOMETHING THAT HE'S EXCITED ABOUT
POD1000000026_S0000046	ACTUALLY BUILDING IT AND LIKE OH A KINDRED SPIRIT THAT'S HERE ON THE WEEKENDS NOT JUST TO CHECK FACEBOOK OR DO SOMETHING BUT IS BUILDING
POD1000000026_S0000047	SO HAVING ANOTHER BUILDER WAS EXCITING I'M LIKE OH SOMEBODY ELSE CARES ABOUT THIS STUFF
POD1000000026_S0000048	I THINK MAYBE WHERE MIKE AND I OVERLAP MOST IS THE FACT THAT WE BOTH LOVE TO MAKE THINGS
POD1000000026_S0000049	MY DREAM WAS ALWAYS TO BUILD SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE USED
POD1000000026_S0000050	SO OUR FRIENDSHIP REVOLVES AROUND THAT
POD1000000026_S0000051	AND IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT THAT ALSO HAPPENS TO BE A PROFESSION
POD1000000026_S0000052	I DID KNOW THAT HE WAS WORKING ON BURBAN
POD1000000026_S0000053	I THINK I ALREADY HAD MAYBE INSTALLED IT AND WAST PLAYING AROUND WITH IT
POD1000000026_S0000054	IT WAS A CHECKIN APP IT LET YOU CHECK IN AT DIFFERENT PLACES
POD1000000026_S0000055	IT WAS A WAY OF SHARING WHAT YOU WERE UP TO AND WHERE YOU WERE
POD1000000026_S0000056	WITH THE TWIST THAT YOU COAULD ADD PHOTOS AND VIDEOS TO IT WHICH IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE WAS ACTUALLY THE ONLY ONE I COULD FIND THAT COULD DO THAT
POD1000000026_S0000057	AND EVEN THOUGH YOU HAD TO JUMP THROUGH ALL THESE SOOPS TO UPLOAD A PHOTO ON BURBAN
POD1000000026_S0000058	PEOPLE WERE DOING IT AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IT WASN'T JUST THIS PERSON IS HERE BUT OH THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE THERE
POD1000000026_S0000059	SO THAT WAS TO ME THE INKLING OF SOMETHING INTERESTING IN URBAN
POD1000000026_S0000060	YOU KNOW I WAS PITCHING IT TO INVESTORS AND ONE OF THE INVESTORS WAS LIKE YEAH HERE'S FIFTY GRAND
POD1000000026_S0000061	YOU CAN GO WORK ON THIS AND LIKE TAKE A SMALL SMALL STYPEND
POD1000000026_S0000062	BUT YOU HAVE TO GET A CO FOUNDER THESE THINGS WORK BEST WHEN YOU HAVE A CO FOUNDER
POD1000000026_S0000063	HE WAS SAYING HEY LOOK AT ALL THE BEST COMPANIES IN THE WORLD
POD1000000026_S0000064	THE LIKE ONES THAT REALLY WORK ARE THE ONES WHERE GENERALLY THERE'S MORE THAN ONE SOLO PERSON RUNNING THE SHIP
POD1000000026_S0000065	GOOGLE WAS A CO FOUNDER PAIR
POD1000000026_S0000066	YOUTUBE WAS A CO FOUNDER PAIR
POD1000000026_S0000067	THE POINT IS WHEN YOU HAVE A TEAM YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO SUCCEED
POD1000000026_S0000068	I AGREED WITH THAT I MEAN THE PATTERN WAS CLEARLY THERE THE EVIDENCE WAS THERE
POD1000000026_S0000069	SO IKIND OF WENT THROUGH THE ROLLDEX IN MY MIND OF LIKE WHO DO I KNOW THAT COULD BE A CO FOUNDER
POD1000000026_S0000070	AND I REMEMBER RUNNING INTO MICE AND I THINK THE NEXT TIME I RAN ITO HIM I FLOATED THE IDEA HEY LIKE MAYBE WE SHOULD WORK TOGETHER ON THIS
POD1000000026_S0000071	WE BASICALLY DECIDED WE WERE GOINNTA PROTOTYPE WORKING TOGETHER
POD1000000026_S0000072	SO WE WOULD GET TOGETHER AT A CAFE NEAR MIKE'S HOUSE AND WE CREATED A FAKE PROJECT
POD1000000026_S0000073	WHY WE DIDN'T JUST WORK ON BURBAN I DON'T KNOW BUT WE CREATED A FAKE PROJECT WITH A FAKE OUTCOME WE WANTED TO ACCOMPLISH THAT NIGHT
POD1000000026_S0000074	MIKE WOULD DO ONE HALF OF IT I'D DO A DIFFERENT HALF OF IT AND WE'D COME TOGETHER AND WE'D ASK QUESTIONS FIGURE OUT HOW EACH OTHER WORKED
POD1000000026_S0000075	AND WE REALLY ENJOYED THAT EXPERIENCE
POD1000000026_S0000076	SO YOU KNOW I REMEMBER THIS FATEFUL DAY STANDING AT THE CAL TRAIN STATION BEFORE MIKE HAD TO GO TO WORK AND
POD1000000026_S0000077	I WAS LIKE MIKE I REALLY WANT TO WORK TOGETHER
POD1000000026_S0000078	MY HEAD I WAS PROBABLY LIKE I REALLY WANT TO WORK TOGETHER AND I REALLY NEED THIS FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS RIGHT SO I NEED A CO FOUNDER TOO
POD1000000026_S0000079	AND I ASKED HIM THIS QUESTION AND I JUST REMEMBER HIS RESPONSE HE'S LIKE COUNT ME INTERESTED
POD1000000026_S0000081	COUNT ME INTERESTED LIKE YOU KNOW ARE YOU IN ARE YOU OUT

POD1000000026_S0000117	AND HE WAS LIKE SO WHAT ARE YOU BUILDING WHAT'S UP LIKE WHAT'S NEW

POD1000000026_S0000121	AND WE WERE SO SAD AFTER THAT MEETING BECAUSE IT WAS SO CLEAR TO US THAT WE COULDN'T EXPLAIN WHAT WE WERE WORKING ON
POD1000000026_S0000122	SO WE WENT BACK TO THE OFFICE WE SAT IN FRONT OF A WHITE BOARD AND WE SAID OKY WE HAVE TO FOCUS THIS THING
POD1000000026_S0000123	TRYING TO DO TOO MUCH ALL AT ONCE
POD1000000026_S0000124	SO WE STRIPPED EVERYTHING AWAY THAT DAY
POD1000000026_S0000125	AND WE FOCUSED JUST ON THE COMPONENTS THAT WOULD EFFECTIVELY BECOME INSTAGRAM
POD1000000026_S0000126	AND MAYBE IN THE COURSE OF A WEEK OR TWO MADE THE FIRST VERSION OF INSTAGRAM
POD1000000026_S0000127	I SPENT FAR MORE TIME WITH KEVIN THAN ANY OTHER HUMAN BEING FOR THAT FIRST YEAR OF INSTAGRAM EASILY RIGHT LIKE WE WERE IN THERE EVERY SINGLE DAY
POD1000000026_S0000128	TWELVE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN HOURS SOMETIMES OVERNIGHT
POD1000000026_S0000129	YOU KNOW MICE WOULD BE BRUSHING HIS TEETH IN THE EMPLOYEE BATHROOM YOU KNOW AT FOUR A M JUST BECAUSE LIKE WE HAD BEEN THERE ALL NIGHT
POD1000000026_S0000130	WE GOT TO LAUNCH DATE WE LAUNCH IT TO THE WORLD
POD1000000026_S0000131	OCTOBER SIX TWO THOUSAND TEN I KNOW THAT DATE AND THE DATE OF MY DAUGHTER'S BIRTH THOSE ARE THE TWO DATES I WILL NEVER FORGET RIGHT
POD1000000026_S0000132	PEOPLE LIKED IT PEOPLE STARTED USING IT
POD1000000026_S0000133	I WAS TAKEN ABACK BECAUSE I MEAN I HAD WORKED AT A COMPANY BEFORE THAT STRUGGLED TO GET TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE TO USE IT OVER A YEAR
POD1000000026_S0000134	AND WE GOT TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND THAT FIRST DAY
POD1000000026_S0000135	AND I REMEMBER TURNING TO MIKE AND I SAID I THINK WE'VE CREATED SOMETHING
POD1000000026_S0000136	I'M USUALLY THE PESSIMIST AND MIKE IS USUALLY I'M NOT SURE OPTIMIST BUT YOU'RE PRAGMATIST RIGHT
POD1000000026_S0000137	BUT LIKE I HAD THIS MOMENT OF CLARITY THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL BECAUSE I HAD NEVER SEEN PEOPLE REACT THIS WAY
POD1000000026_S0000138	AND MIKE JUST LOOKED AT ME LIKE I DON'T KNOW MAYBE NOT MAYBE THIS IS ALL GOING TA COME CRASHING DOWN
POD1000000026_S0000139	THE ONE LITTLE DINKY SERVER THAT WE HAD WAS JUST LIKE METAPHORICALLY AND PERHAPS PHYSICALLY MELTING BY ALL THE TRAFFIC THAT WAS COMING AT IT
POD1000000026_S0000140	I REALLY FELT LIKE WE HAD SQUANDERED THIS OPPORTUNITY
POD1000000026_S0000141	AND I WAS LIKE PROBABLY ADD ANOTHER SERVER
POD1000000026_S0000142	AND KEVIN WAS LIKE NO WE DON'T NEED ANOTHER SE
POD1000000026_S0000143	ANDYOU KNOW N IN RETROSPECT I THINK IT WAS LIKE YOU KNOW WE DIDN'T KNOW IF THIS THING WAS GOING TO TAKE OFF AND IT WAS EXPENSIVE TO AD ANOTHER SERVER LIKE DID WE REALLY NEED IT
POD1000000026_S0000144	N IWS IKE NO I THINK WE DO
POD1000000026_S0000145	AD THEN LIKE LATER HE'S LIKE OH MAN SORRY LIKE I WAS LITTLE HEAT
POD1000000026_S0000146	U KNOW WE HAD BEEN UP FOR THIRTY SIX HOURS AT THAT POINT KIND OF FIGHTING OFF SLEEP AND ALSO EXCITED
POD1000000026_S0000148	BOTH THE BEST AND WORST DAYS OF OUR LIVES
POD1000000026_S0000149	LIE YOU KNOW THE THING WAS WORKING BUT I ALSO WAS CRASHING
POD1000000026_S0000150	I THINK THAT WAS LIKE THE ONLY TIME WE'VE EVER RAISED OUR VOICES WITH EACH OTHE
POD1000000026_S0000151	WAS BRIEF IT WAS LIKE A PROBABLY THIRTY SECOND INTERACTION
POD1000000026_S0000152	I APPROVE THIS MESSAGE
POD1000000026_S0000154	WHICH IS TRUE LIKE THAT WAS THE ONE TIME THAT IT WAS HEATED AND IT WAS JUST THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT
POD1000000026_S0000155	I'M ACTUALL GON NO TAKE IT WAY BACK AT OUR FIRST DISAGREEMENT WHICH I ACTUALLY HADEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IN MANY YEARS
POD1000000026_S0000156	TWO OR THREE WEEKS INTO WORKING TOGETHER I REMEMBER COMING IN ONE DAY AND SAYING
POD1000000026_S0000157	WHAT DO YOU THINK OF US LIKE ONE OR TWO DAYS A WEEK JUST WORKING FROM HOME BECAUSE I CAN JUST JAM ON STUFF AND JUST STAY UP ALL NIGHT AND CODE AND I'LLIKE BE UP TILL NON
POD1000000026_S0000158	TLL LIKE I THINK I'LL WORK BETTER THAT WAY AND YOU'RE LIKE
POD1000000026_S0000159	NO I'D REALLY LIKE FOR US TO BE IN THE SAME OFFICE TOGETHER I THINK THAT MATTERS A LOT
POD1000000026_S0000160	AND I REMEMBER BEING ANNOYED FOR LIKE TEN SECONDS
POD1000000026_S0000162	I WAS LIKE OKA LIKE SURE LIKE WE' GIVE THAT A TRY
POD1000000026_S0000163	YOU KNOW AND LIKE IN THE END IT WAS GREAT LIKE WE WERE ABLE TO JAM ON IDEAS AND MOVE REALLY QUICKLY AND
POD1000000026_S0000164	IF I HAD TO LIKE ABSTRACT IT AND WHAT I LEARNED ABOUT WORKING WITH KEVIN OVER THE YEARS IT WAS I DON'T THINK YOU'RE EVER A PERSON THAT WILL JUST AGREE TO SOMETHING BECAUSE IT WILL MAKE SOMEBODY ELSE HAPPY
POD1000000026_S0000165	BUT YOU ALSO MAKE SURE THAT IN DISAGREEING YOU'RE ALSO NOT BEING A JERK AND MAKING THEM FEEL BAD ABOUT FEELING DIFFERENTLY YOU'RE LIKE
POD1000000026_S0000166	NOW I'VE TOUGHT ABOUT THIS AND HERE'S KNOW WHAT I WANT TO DO
POD1000000026_S0000167	IS THERE LIKE A REASON WHY YOU KNOW YOU REALLY FEEL DIFFERENTLY AND THEN WE CAN HAVE THE CONVERSATION
POD1000000026_S0000168	THAT SORT OF LIKE DETOXIFIED ABILITY TO DISAGREE IS REALLY IMPORTANT
POD1000000026_S0000169	I GET ANNOYED REALLY EASILY
POD1000000026_S0000170	BUT THE INTERESTING THING IS MIKE DOESN'T ANNOY ME LIKE HE REALLY DOEST
POD1000000026_S0000171	I REALLY DON'T GET ANNOYED WITH MIKE BECAUSE HE HAS CHARACTER AND INTEGRITY
POD1000000026_S0000172	THOSE ARE THE TWO THINGS I CARE ABOUT
POD1000000026_S0000173	K IF YOU'RE JUST A GENERALLY GOOD PERSON AND WHEN YOU SAY YOU'RE GOIN TO DO SOMETHING YOU DO IT
POD1000000026_S0000174	WHO CARES IF LIKE YOU KNOW MIKE CHOSE THE WRONG X WY OR Z TO SOLVE A PROBLEM OR MAYBE INTRODUCED A BUGG OR WHAT LIKE I DON'T CARE
POD1000000026_S0000175	MIKE HAS NEVER MADE EXCEPT FOR THAT ONE TIME ON THE SERVER ISSUE MIKE HAS NEVER MADE ME ANGRY
POD1000000026_S0000176	I DON'T THINK WE EVER ACTUALLY HAD TITLES FOR THE LONGEST TIME
POD1000000026_S0000177	I GUESS ONCE WE STARTED DOING PUBLIC YOU KNOW EVENTS AND WE HAD TO TALK ABOUT WHAT OUR TITLES WERE
POD1000000026_S0000178	THERE WAS A TIME WHERE WE WERE LIKE OKAY YOU'RE CTO I'M CEO AND WE KIND OF LIKE DIVIDED IT THAT WAY
POD1000000026_S0000179	BUT YOU ALWAYS SAY COFOUNDER FIRST THAT'S THE TITLE
POD1000000026_S0000180	WHEN I THOUGHT ABOUT MY IDENTITY AND LIKE WHAT WE WERE DOING I THE COMPAN WAS LIKE CO FOUNDER MAYBE TECHNICAL CO FOUNDER IF YOU WANTED TO PUT AN ADJECTIVE IN FRONT OF IT
POD1000000026_S0000181	REQUIRED TECHNICAL CO FOUNDERI
POD1000000026_S0000184	BUT I DO ALSO THINK ATTHI SPEAKSTO AUR PERSONALITY AND OUR RELATIONSHIP IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ANY COMPANY TO ULTIMATELY HAVE ONE FINAL DECISIONAE
POD1000000026_S0000185	I'VE SEEN SO MANY COMPANIES NOT HAVE ONE AND IT BECOME A MESS SOMETIMES THERE'S A TYPEBREAKE NEEDED OR SOMETIMES LIKE A CALL NEEDS TO GET MADE
POD1000000026_S0000186	YOU REALLY NEED TO FIND SOMEBODY WHO'S WILLING TO LIKE MAKE THAT CALL AND YOU ALL HAVE TO BE READY TO LIKE MAKE THAT PERSON SUCCESSFUL IN THAT ROLE OR ELSE IT'S JUST NOT GOING TO WORK
POD1000000026_S0000187	WE HAD A BUNCH OF PEOPLE THAT REALLY WANTED INSTAGRAM INSIDE OF THEIR COMPANY
POD1000000026_S0000188	BUT WE WERE HAVING SO MUCH FUN DOING OUR OWN THING THAT LIKE WE JUST DIDN'T WANT TO LIKE BE PART OF ANY OTHER COMPANY
POD1000000026_S0000189	DIDN'T WANT TO BE A WING OF A BUILDING WE WANTED TO BE THE BUILDING
POD1000000026_S0000190	AND I REMEMBER YOU TURNED TO ME AT ONE POIN ND YOU'RE LIKE I REALLY DON'T THINK WE SHOULD LIKE PURSUE ANY OF THESE
POD1000000026_S0000191	LIKE I THINK WE'RE BETTER OFF INDEPENDENT BUTY IF YOU FEEL DIFFERENTLY LIKE LET ME KNOW LIKE LET'S HAVE THAT CONVERSATION
POD1000000026_S0000192	WAS HELPFUL BCAUSE IT MADE ME REFLECT AND BE LIKE NO NO THIS IS REALLY
POD1000000026_S0000193	I'M WORKING WITH SOMEBODY I DEEPLY RESPECT WE'RE STARTING TO BUILD A TEAM THAT'S WORKING
POD1000000026_S0000194	YEAH LET'S LIKE LET'S KEEP DOING THIS THING WE STILL GOT MONEY IN THE BANK
POD1000000026_S0000195	SO YOU KNOW FOR THE LONGEST TIME WE WERE JUST LIKE WE'RE GON TO DO THIS THING OURSELVES
POD1000000026_S0000196	AND THE ONLY TIME WE LITERALLY HAD LIKE A NUMBER TO FACE WAS THE FACEBOOK OFFER
POD1000000026_S0000197	WHEN WE WERE LIKE OH A BILLION DOLLARS JUST SOUNDS FUNNY TO SAY RIGHT LIKE
POD1000000026_S0000198	IT'S A BILLION YOU THINK OF LIKE DOTR EVIL IN ONE OF THESE MOVIES RIGHT
POD1000000026_S0000199	BUT SOMEONE COMES ALONG AND OFFERS YOU A BILLION DOLLARS FOR SOMETHING YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR I DON'T KNOW ALL OF A YEAR PUBLICLY AND THEN YOU'VE GOT ELEVEN EMPLOYEES AND YOU'RE JUST LIKE MAN I' LIKE HOW DO YOU EVEN DO THAT CALCULUS LIKE
POD1000000026_S0000200	WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT
POD1000000026_S0000201	BUTI REALLY REMEMBER BEING IN SORT OF LIKE A DAZE IT'S LIKE EVERYTHING WAS JUST VERY STRANGE
POD1000000026_S0000202	WE HAD A LONG CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT WE WANTED TO DO
POD1000000026_S0000203	AT THE END OF THE DAY THE THING THAT MATTERED THE MOST TO US WAS THAT THEY WANTED US TO KEEP RUNNING IT INDEPENDENTLY LIKE WE HAD BEEN DOING THEYD
POD1000000026_S0000204	THEY WERE LIKE NO INSTAGRAM IS A THING
POD1000000026_S0000205	YOUR COMMUNITY YOU GUYS HAVE EFFECTIVELY A TEAM AND A COMPANY AND A CULTURE
POD1000000026_S0000206	KEEP DOING THAT
POD1000000026_S0000207	AND WE STAYED SIX YEARS
POD1000000026_S0000208	THERE WAS A LOT OF LIKE HEY CHECKING IN HOW ARE YOU FEELING WHAT DO YOU WANT TA DO LIKE
POD1000000026_S0000209	WE ONLY WANTED TO BE AT INSTAGRAM IF THE OTHER PERSON WAS AT INSTAGRAM
POD1000000026_S0000210	EVERY JANUARY I WOULD DECIDE I WANTED TO CONSCIOUSLY RECOMMIT TO STILL BEING THERE
POD1000000026_S0000211	MAKE IT AN INTENTIONAL C I C
POD1000000026_S0000212	LIKE I COME AROUND IN JANUARY AND I SAY IS THIS STILL WHAT I WANT TO BE LEARNING
POD1000000026_S0000213	IVOWED TO MYSELF IT'S FUNNY THE VOWS YOU MAKE TO YOURSELF WHEN YOU'REGHTEEN EAR
POD1000000026_S0000214	I VOWED MY SEL WHEN I WAS EIGHTEEN I WANTED TO HAVE A LIFE FULL OF UNIQUE YEARS NOT THE SAME YEAR OVER AND OVER
POD1000000026_S0000215	THAT WAS MY BIGGEST FEAR
POD1000000026_S0000216	AND I LOOKED AND IWAS LIKE I FEEL LIKE YOU KNOW WE'VE DONE INCREDIBLY HARD THINGS
POD1000000026_S0000217	I'VE LEARNED A TON BUT IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE ON SOME LIKE DIMINISHING RETURNS CURVE OF LEARNING
POD1000000026_S0000218	AND I REMEMBER IA DINNER WITH KEVIN I WAS LIKE HEY MAN LIKE I FEEL LIKE IT MIGHT BE TIME FOR ME TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT WHICH IS LIKE A HARD CONVERS LIKE IT'S A SCARY CONVERSATION TO HAVE
POD1000000026_S0000219	IMEMBER KEVIN TURNED TO ME E SAID LIKE IGET WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM
POD1000000026_S0000220	IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU THINK WOULD STILL FEEL LIKE A NEW INTERESTING THING
POD1000000026_S0000221	LIKE LISTED A COUPLE OF THINGS
POD1000000026_S0000222	AND THEN I HAD THE ITERESTING EXPERIENCE OF KIND OF DOING PART OF KEVIN'S JOB FOR A FEW MONTHS BECAUSE HE WENT OUT ON PATERNITY LEAVE
POD1000000026_S0000223	AND HE WAS OUT AND HE SAID MIKE I'M ON PATURNITY LEAVE I REALLY WANT TO BE PRESENT WITH MY KID LIKE
POD1000000026_S0000224	CAN YOU MAKE SURE THINGS GO WELL WHILE I'M AWAY
POD1000000026_S0000225	AND IT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE IN MY HEAD I ALWAYS HAD THIS QUESTION LIKE IS THE ONE THING THAT WOULD MAKE ME STAY LIKE TO HAVE THIS VERY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE OF BEING CEO RATHER THAN CTO
POD1000000026_S0000226	I GOT TO HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE FOR LIKE TWO MONTHS
POD1000000026_S0000227	REMEMBER KEVIN CUTTING BACK I WA LIKE KEVIN I DO NOT WANT YOUR JOB
POD1000000026_S0000228	AND LIKE WE'D ALWAYS JOKED THAT ONE OF THE REASONS WE WORKED TOGETHER IS THAT WE DIDN'T WANT EACH OTHER'S JOBS
POD1000000026_S0000229	AND AT SOME POINT IT FELT LIKE A THING IH'D ALWAY SAID AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE IT WAS ACTUALLY REALLY TRUE
POD1000000026_S0000230	BUT I REMEMBER AT THE ND O THAT EXPERIENCE BEING LIKE NO I'M REALLY GLAD I GOT TO TRY IT BCAUSE I MADE ME REALIZE LIKE WHERE MY HAPPY SPOT IS IS A NOT IN THAT ROLE
POD1000000026_S0000231	IN THE ROLE I WAS IN AND IN THAT ROLE I FEEL LIKE I'VE ACCOMPLISHED WHAT I WANTED TO ACCOMPLISH
POD1000000026_S0000232	AND I WANTED SOMETHING HARD
POD1000000026_S0000233	D I WANTED TO BE BAD AT SOMETHING AGAIN
POD1000000026_S0000234	MAYBE IT WON'T BE AS BIG AS INSTAGRAM MAYBE IT WON'T
POD1000000026_S0000235	PROBABLY WON'T BE AS BIG AS INSTAGRAM LET'S BE HONEST
POD1000000026_S0000236	BUT MAYBE IT'LL BE JUST AS FUN TO LEARN ALONG THE WAY
POD1000000026_S0000237	THAT'S ULTIMATELY WHAT MADE ME WANT TO JUMP
POD1000000026_S0000238	BUT WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT WE WERE GOIN TO DO
POD1000000026_S0000239	THE FIRST THING WAS REST AND RECOVERY
POD1000000026_S0000240	WE WERE KIND OF OFF DOING OUR OWN THING WE WANTED TO JUST CHILL OUT AND DISCONNECT A LITTLE BIT BUT WE RECONNECTED AND IT WAS LIKE YEAH WHAT DO YOU MISS THE MOST
POD1000000026_S0000241	IT'S LIKE WELL I MIS HANGING OUT OF COURSE AND YOU SAY THOSE NICE THINGS TO EACH OTHER BUT I MISS BUILDING STUFF
POD1000000026_S0000242	I LEARNED A BIG LESSON I THINK IN THE MIDDLE MONTHS BEFORE WE REALLY RECONNECTED WHICH WAS I THINK I'M HOLDING THIS IDEA OF KEVIN IN MY HEAD OF LIKE
POD1000000026_S0000243	I BET HE'S LIKE ALREADY THOUGHT OF LIKE WHAT'S NEXT AND LIKE HE HASN'T TOLD ME ABOUT
POD1000000026_S0000244	I REALIZED LIKE
POD1000000026_S0000245	OH NO
POD1000000026_S0000246	I CREATED THIS LIKE THING OF LIKE OH LIKE WE HAVEN'T TALKED NF
POD1000000026_S0000247	YOU THINK ABOUT IT I'VE NEVER YOU KNOW ACTUALY THOUGHT ABOUTHIS BUT LIKE THAT WAS THE LONGEST WE WENT WITHOUT REALLY TALKING IN NINE YEARS
POD1000000026_S0000248	SO LKE
POD1000000026_S0000250	WAS LIKE MAN LIKE WE HAVEN'T TALKED WHICH MUST MAN THAT LIKE HE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK TO
POD1000000026_S0000251	AND I REMEMBER HAVING THIS PHONE CALL THAT WAS SO LIKE WHAT A RELIEF LIKE WE TALKED ON THE PHONE AND YOU'RE LIKE YEAH LIKE I'M WHERE YOU ARE
POD1000000026_S0000252	IKE I HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF WHAT'S NEXT ANI'D LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU AND WAS IK D LOVE TO LI LOVE TO KEEP WORKING WITH YOU TOO
POD1000000026_S0000253	TO ME THE LESSON LEARNED WAS LIKE IF YOU HAVE LIKE A VERY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMEBODY AND THEN YOU JUST DON'T TALK TO THEM FOR A FEW MONTHS LIKE
POD1000000026_S0000254	YOUR BRAIN IS GOING TO START ASSUMING THAT THAT SILENCE MEANS SOMETHING THAT IT ABSOLUTELY DOES
POD1000000026_S0000255	TJUST MEANT THAT WE JUST NEEDED SOME TIME TO CLEAR OUR HEADS AND HAVE OUR OWN THING
POD1000000026_S0000256	ADONSC HE TALKED WAS LIKE OH OKY GREAT HE FEELS THE SAME WAY I DO WHICH IS LIKE WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT IS YET BUT WE WANT TO DO IT WITH EACH OTHER
POD1000000026_S0000257	AND THAT WAS A REAL LIKE RELIEF FOR ME I WASLIKE GREAT WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE AND NOW WE CAN JUST SPEND THE TIME TO EXPLORE AND FIGURE OUT WHAT WE'RE EXCITED TO BUILD NEXT
POD1000000026_S0000258	BOTH OF US WANTED TO DO SOMETHING TOGETHER AGAIN
POD1000000026_S0000259	LIKE THAT WAS RARE LIKE MOST CO FOUNDER PAIRS FIND THEMSELVES IN SOME SORT OF FIGHT ALONG THE WAY AND BREAK UP AND
POD1000000026_S0000260	THE IDEA THAT WE COULD HAVE A NEW CHALLENGE TOGETHER POTENTIALLY I THINK WAS WHAT MADE IT WAY MORE EXCITING
POD1000000026_S0000261	I'M NOT SURE WE WERE LIKE LOOKING FOR PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WHEN WE STARTED LIKE A FRIENDSHIP
POD1000000026_S0000262	BUT THE BOND WE HAVE NOW
POD1000000026_S0000264	I THINK I'D LIKEN TO PEOPLE WHO LIKE WERE IN THE MILITARY TOGETHER
POD1000000026_S0000265	I'M NOT LIKE SAYING WE'RE WE DID ANYTHING EVEN CLOSE TO AS IMPORTANT AS THAT BUT WHEN YOU GO THROUGH THINGS WITH SOMEONE WHEN PEOPLE TRY TO KILL YOUR COMPANY WHEN PEOPLE TRY TO THROW YOU ONTO THE BUS
POD1000000026_S0000266	ALL THIS STUFF HAS HAPPENED TO US AND THEN SOME
POD1000000026_S0000267	AND I REMEMBER VERY SPECIFICALLY THIS MOMENT WE WE'RE HAVING A DISAGREEMENT WITH AN INVESTOR
POD1000000026_S0000268	AND WE WERE SO STRESSED OUT AND WE WENT TO THIS REALLY TERRIBLE TAKAREA ON MARKET STREET
POD1000000026_S0000269	BUT WE SAT DOWN AND WE BOTH ORDERED LIKE THE GREASIEST THING WE COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE
POD1000000026_S0000270	AND HONESTLY THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LOW IN THE COMPANY BUT IT WAS A HIGH FOR ME
POD1000000026_S0000271	LIKE I LOOK BACK ON THAT MOMENT REALLY FONDLY BECAUSE IT WAS US AGAINST THE WORLD
POD1000000026_S0000272	IT WAS LIKE WE'RE GOING TO WIN THIS THING EVEN IF PEOPLE DON'T BELIEVE IN US EVEN IF WE'RE HAVING THIS THING GO ON LIKE WE'RE GOIN TO MAKE THIS WORK
POD1000000026_S0000273	CALL IT FRIENDSHIP BUT THAT IS LIKE A BOND THAT YOU DON'T FORM HANGING OUT
POD1000000026_S0000274	THE FACT THAT WE STILL LIKED EACH OTHER THIS LONG I THINK SPEAKS TO LIKE A DEEPER TRUST AND LIKE REAL BOND
POD1000000026_S0000275	BUT I THINK THE FACT THAT WE LIKED EACH OTHER AFTER THAT FIRST YEAR WHICH WAS LIKE PURE EXPOSURE SPOKE TO TRUST BUT I THINK ALSO JUST TO
POD1000000026_S0000276	WE HAVE A WAY ABOUT EACH OTHER THAT IS NOT ONE THAT WE FIND ANNOYING
POD1000000026_S0000277	ICH SOUNDS TRIVIAL BUT ACTUALLY WHEN YOU'RE THAT AROUND SOMEBODY FOR THAT LONG FOR THAT MANY DAYS
POD1000000026_S0000278	AND YOU HAVEN'T SHOWERED IN THREE DAYS SOMETIMES AND YOU'RE EATING THE SAME LUNCH YOU'VE EATEN EVERY SINGLE DAY LIKE

POD1000000028_S0000195	WHEN HE WAS TOGETHER WITH BELL AN MARTA HE WAS A TOUGH GUY BECAUSE HE HAD TO LOOK LIKE A TOUGH GUY BECAUSE HE WOULD AVE PROBABLY LOST HIS JOB IF HE DIDN'T
POD1000000028_S0000196	SO EVERY TIME WE WENT TO PRACTICE AT THE GYM IN THE AFTERNOON AND GAEZA WAS THERE BEFORE AND HE WAS ALWAYS AT THE DOOR LOOKING THROUGH THE KEYHOLE AND WHEN BELA MARTACAMI SAID SIX SIX SIX AND FIVE FIVE WAS MARTIN AND SIX WAS BELLA
POD1000000028_S0000197	GAIZA USED DANCE COUNTS AS CODE NAMES FOR MARTA AND BELLA
POD1000000028_S0000198	THAT'S HOW WE KNEW WHEN HE SAID SIX WE ALREADY WERE LIKE OH MY GOSH BELL'S COMING
POD1000000028_S0000199	SOME DAYS BELLA DISAPPEARED FROM THE GYM TO GO HUNTING
POD1000000028_S0000200	THOSE ARE THE BEST DAYS OF OUR LIVES IN THE GYM SO BASICALLY TRACULA WASN'T THERE
POD1000000028_S0000201	WHO WAS DRACULA
POD1000000028_S0000202	OBELLA
POD1000000028_S0000204	BELLA AND MARTA FACED ENORMOUS PRESSURE GOING INTO THE NINETEEN EIGHTY OLYMPICS THEIR STANDING WITH THE GOVERNMENT WAS ONLY AS GOOD AS THEIR NEXT RESULT
POD1000000028_S0000205	THEY'D HAVE TO MATCH OR BEAT THE SUCCESS OF THE SEVENTY SIX GAMES TO KEEP THEIR COUNTRY'S FAVOR
POD1000000028_S0000206	THE ENTIRE ROMANIAN TEAM FELT THE WEIGHT OF THEIR COUNTRY'S OPPRESSIVE REGIME WHEN THEY MET WITH OFFICIALS BEFORE THEY LEFT FOR MOSCOW
POD1000000028_S0000207	SOME KIND OF LIUTENANT I DON'T KNOW HE WAS ALL DRESSED IN GREEN AND STUFF BIG AND BIG GUY AND REALLY SERIOUS AND HE SAID YOU BETTER THINK WHAT YOU'RE DOING TWICE DON'T YOU EVER BRING SHAME ON YOUR COUNTRY YOU'RE WAIING OUR COUNTRY ON YOUR SHOULDERS
POD1000000028_S0000208	TRYING TO DEFEND HER GOLD MEDAL IN THE ALL AROUND NADIA BECAME THE CENTER OF A JUDGING DISPUTE
POD1000000028_S0000210	THEY WENT ON A BEAM AND HER BEAM SCORE DIDN'T COME UP
POD1000000028_S0000212	BELLA PROTESTED NADIA'S LOW BEAM SCORE IN FULL VIEW OF THE TELEVISION CAMERAS
POD1000000028_S0000214	NADIA HAD TO SETTLE FOR SILVER IN THE ALL AROUND BUT WENT ON TO WIN GOLD ON FLOOR AND BEAM TRUDY WON A SILVER METAL ON THE UNEVEN BARS
POD1000000028_S0000215	THE ROMANIANS REPEATED WITH A SILVER IN THE TEAM COMPETITION BUT THIS TIME FINISHING SECOND TO THE RUSSIANS WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT BELLA AND MARTA WEREN'T RETURNING TO ROMANIA AS HEROES AGAIN
POD1000000028_S0000216	SO WHEN WE MADE THE BIG BRUHAHA ABOUT NADA ACCORRING ON BEM THE GOVERNMENT DIDN'T LIKE IT
POD1000000028_S0000217	IN A SOCIETY HYPERSENSITIVE ABOUT HOW IT WAS PERCEIVED ON THE WORLD STAGE AND PARTICULARLY BY ITS COMMUNIST ALLIES BELA'S PROTEST IN RESPONSE TO THE RUSSIAN JUDGE EMBARRASSED THE ROMANIAN OFFICIALS
POD1000000028_S0000218	PLUS HIS MOST IMPORTANT ALLIY IN THE CHAOCHESKU REGIME
POD1000000028_S0000219	HAD JUST BEEN DEMODED
POD1000000028_S0000220	SO BALAN KNEW THAT THE END IS CLOSE THEN HE TOLD ME AT THAT MOMENT WE ARE IN A BIG TROUBLE AND FROM THERE EVERYTHING STARTED TO GO SOUR FOR US
POD1000000028_S0000222	THE FIRST TIME I EVER SAW BELLA COROLI IN ACTION WITH HIS GIMNUS WAS PRETTY MEMORABLE
POD1000000028_S0000224	WAS THE NADIA EIGHTY ONE TOUR WHEN BELLA AND THE ROMANIAN WOMEN'S NATIONAL TEAM TOURED WITH THE AMERICAN TEAM IN MARCH NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE
POD1000000028_S0000225	MY REPORTING PARTNER BONNY FORD COVERED THE DETROIT STOP OF THE NADIA EIGHTY ONE TOUR A SEVEN CITY PROMOTIONAL TOUR OF THE U S FEATURING THE ROMANIAN NATIONAL TEAM AND ITS SUPERSTAR
POD1000000028_S0000226	SO I PERSONALLY AS BOTH AN OLYMPIC FAN AND A REPORTER AT THAT TIME I DIDN'T THINK OF IT AS A POLITICAL EVENT WHERE THE ROMANIANS WERE SHOWING OFF THEIR SYSTEM SO TO SPEAK
POD1000000028_S0000227	CERTAINLY THEY DID THEY SAW IT AS A PROPAGANDA TOOL AND A CHANCE TO HIGHLIGHT THEIR EXCELLENCE
POD1000000028_S0000229	BUT TO ME IT WAS JUST A CHANCE TO SEE THE BEST ATHLETE IN HER SPORT
POD1000000028_S0000231	I WAS FOCUSED ON NADIA THE AUDIENCE WAS FOCUSED ON NADIA A LOT OF YOU KNOW VERY EXCITED YOUNG GIRLS THIS WAS LIKE BETLE MANIA NADIA MANIA WAS DEFINITELY A REAL THING
POD1000000028_S0000233	BELLA KROLI WAS VERY VISIBLE AND HE WAS UNMISTAKABLE ON THE FLOOR HUGE GUY HE WAS IN OUR EYES THE GURU THE GENIUS BEHIND NADIA'S PRECISION AND AND PERFECTION
POD1000000028_S0000234	BEING ON TOUR WITH BELLA AS THE ROMANIANS COACH IT WAS INTERESTING TO WATCH HIM AND THE GIMNOSS REALLY JUST HOW THEY INTERACTED WITH EACH OTHER
POD1000000028_S0000235	THE U S NATIONAL TEAM HAD BEEN INVITED TO PERFORM WITH THE ROMANIANS ON THEIR TOUR TRACY TALIVERA WAS A MEMBER OF THAT TEAM
POD1000000028_S0000236	THE GYMNISTS WERE ALWAYS VERY STERN VERY ROBOTIC THEY WORKED EXTREMELY HARD THEY DID NUMBERS OF ROUTINES AND SKILLS WAY BEYOND WHAT WE HAD EVER SEEN
POD1000000028_S0000237	MIKE JACQUI THE MAN WHO WOULD BECOME THE PRESIDENT OF THE U S GYMNASTICS FEDERATION WAS ON THE TOUR WORKING FOR ONE OF THE EQUIPMENT SPONSORS HE HAD A FRONT ROW SEAT TO THE CAROLIES
POD1000000028_S0000238	MARTA WAS IN THE BACKGROUND SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING BELLA INSTRUCTED HER LIKE HE INSTRUCTED EVERYBODY ELSE SHE WAS VERY SUBSERVIENT I MEAN YOU KN IT WAS NOT A COACHING DUEL
POD1000000028_S0000239	HE WAS DEFINITELY THE COACH AND SHE WAS DEFINITELY THE THIRD ASSISTANT EVEN THOUGH THERE WASN'T A FIRST OR SECOND ASSISTANT
POD1000000028_S0000240	BUT DESPITE HOW WELL THE TOUR WAS GOING THINGS BEHIND THE SCENES WERE DETERIORATING FOR THE ROMANIAN COACHES
POD1000000028_S0000241	THEY COULD TELL FROM THE WAY OFFICIALS WERE TREATING THEM THAT THEY WERE IN DANGER OF LOSING THEIR JOBS AND THEIR PRESTIGE
POD1000000028_S0000242	WE WENT THERE AND WE WERE TREATED VERY POORLY FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE TOUR I MEAN TEPRESIDENT OF THE GYMNASTIC FEDERATION WAS VERY GAVE US A COLD SHOL THERE
POD1000000028_S0000243	ON THE WASHINGTON DC STOP THEY WERE INVITED TO A DINNER PARTY HOSTED BY THE ROMANIAN AMBASSADOR
POD1000000028_S0000244	AND ON THE DINNER PARTY NOBODY WOULD TALK TO US TWEY LOOK AT US LIKE STRANGERS IKE NOT EVEN PART OF THE TEAM I THINK WE HAD OUR FEELING THAT SOMETHING WAS GOING ON
POD1000000028_S0000245	BILA SAID THAT I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE ANY FUTURE BACK IN ROMANIA
POD1000000028_S0000246	THE TOUR WAS ALMOST OVER IN TWO DAYS THEY'D BE HEADED HOME THE COROLIES IN GAIZA KNEW THINGS COULD ONLY GET WORSE FOR THEM THAT THEIR FAVOR WITH A FICKLE AND PUNITIVE GOVERNMENT WAS WANING
POD1000000028_S0000247	THEY WERE TIRED OF THE SCRUTINY IN ROMANIA EVERYONE WAS WATCHED ALL THE TIME BELLA HAD FANTASIZED ABOUT WHAT A LIFE IN THE UNITED STATES COULD BE
POD1000000028_S0000248	THEY HAD TO MAKE A DECISION
POD1000000028_S0000249	WE MADE THE PLAN
POD1000000028_S0000250	AFTER THE FINAL SHOW THE TEAM RETURNED TO NEW YORK BEFORE TRAVELING BACK TO ROMANIA BUT THE COACHES HAD NO INTENTION OF GETTING ON THAT PLANE
POD1000000028_S0000251	MARDA HAD AN ANT WITH A PLACE IN MANHATTAN THAT THEY COULD USE TO HIDE OUT FOR A FEW DAYS IN ORDER TO GET THERE GAIZA WOULD HAVE TO DISTRACT HIS ROOMMATE THE HEAD OF THE ROMANIAN SECURITY DETAIL
POD1000000028_S0000252	THE PLAN WAS THAT I WILL TAKE THE SECRET SERVICE GUY OUT TO A SHOPPING AND THEN WE MEET AT THE APPARTMENT
POD1000000028_S0000254	THE MORNING OF MARCH THIRTIE NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE TRUDY AND HER TEAMMATES WERE TOLD THEY COULD GO SHOPPING AS LONG AS THEY WERE BACK IN TIME TO BOARD A BUS TO JFK AIRPORT AT NOON
POD1000000028_S0000255	SO WE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY AND WE MET DOWN IN THE HALLWAY AND THEY SAID OKAY SO YOU HAVE TWO HOURS NO FUNNY BUSINESS NO CHOCOLATES NO EATING NO NOTHING

POD1000000028_S0000258	TRUDY FOLLOWED BELLA'S ORDERS AND WENT BACK TO THEIR ROOM WITH MARTA

POD1000000028_S0000262	BELLA AND MARTA ASKED TRUDY TO BRING BACK LUGGAGE FOR THEIR FAMILIES
POD1000000028_S0000263	AND THEN THEY JUST TOLD ME SAID WE JUST HAVE ONE REQUEST PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE THIS ROOM YOU DON'T LEAVE THIS ROOM FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES AFTER WE'RE OUT OF THIS

POD1000000028_S0000265	THAT'S WHEN I KNEW FOR SURE I SAID OH WE REALLY WE REALLY GOT RID OF THE TRACKL WE'RE NOT GONNA GET BEATEN EVER AGAIN LIFE IS GONNO BE GOOD FROM NOW ON
POD1000000028_S0000266	MEANWHILE GAIZA GOT HIS SECURITY GUARD ROOMMATE OUT OF THE HOTEL AND INTO THE CROWDED STREETS OF TIME SQUARE FOR THEIR OWN SHOPPING TRIP
POD1000000028_S0000267	A BIG CEL BIG CEL I THINK WE HAD OUR FEELING THAT SOMETHING WAS GOING ON WE HAD SOME PLANS HE WOULD NOT LET ME GO AND SUDDENLY HE SEES LITTLE STORE WITH UMBRELLAS
POD1000000028_S0000268	GAIZA HAD HIS OPPORTUNITY
POD1000000028_S0000269	I SAW A CAB YOU KNOW STOPPING DOWN THE STREET I JUMPED TO A CAB AND I WAS GONE

POD1000000028_S0000274	THERE WAS NO ONE TO STOP HER AT NOON AS PLANNED THE ROMANIAN NATIONAL TEAM BOARDED A BUS TO THE AIRPORT

POD1000000028_S0000276	THERE WAS NO SIGN OF BELLA MARTA OR GAIZA
POD1000000028_S0000277	AND SO THE BUS LEFT WE GOT TO THE AIRPORT NOBELLA WE GOT TO THE PLANE NOBELA
POD1000000028_S0000278	THE PLANE WAITED THREE HOURS ON THE TARMAC
POD1000000028_S0000279	I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT TO MYSELF I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT UNTIL THE PLANE TOOK OFF AND I SAW THEY'RE NOT IN THE PLANE I SAID OKY NOW THEY CAN'T COME ANYMORE

POD1000000030_S0000001	IF IT SAVES ENERGY AND GIVES YOUR PERFORMANCE A BOOST WELL WHEN IS A SHOE JUST A SHOE FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA THIS IS MARKETPLACE TECH DEMYSTIFYING THE DIGITAL ECONOMY I'M JACK STEWART IN FOR MOLLY WOOD
POD1000000030_S0000003	WORLD ATHLETICS THE GOVERNING BODY FOR TRACK AND FIELD IS SET TO ANNOUNCE WHETHER IT'LL BAN CERTAIN TYPES OF SHOES
POD1000000030_S0000004	IN PARTICULAR NIKE'S VAPOR FLY SHOES HAVE BEEN PROMINENTLY ON THE FEET OF ATHLETES RESPONSIBLE FOR TUMBLING RACE RECORDS RECENTLY
POD1000000030_S0000005	NIKEY CLAIMS THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS SNEAKERS SHAVE UP TO FOUR PERCENT OFF A RUNNER'S TIME SO IS THAT TECHNOLOGY DOPING
POD1000000030_S0000006	WE GOT A HOLD OF IAN HUNTER PROFESSOR OF EXERCISE SCIENCE AT BRIGHAM YUNG UNIVERSITY AS HE WAS WITH SOME ATHLETES TRAINING AT BI U'S INDOOR TRACK HE TOLD US THE SHOES WORK BY COMBINING FOAM IN THE SOUL WITH A CARBON FIBERE PLATE
POD1000000030_S0000007	I THINK THE PLATE MOSTLY ALLOWS FOR SOME STRUCTURE OF THE SHOE
POD1000000030_S0000008	SO IF THAT PLATE WASN'T THERE AND YOU HAVE A FORTY FOUR MILLIMETRE HEIGHT OFF THE GROUND THAT'S JUST FOAM AND YOU TRY RUNNING AROUND A CORNER IT'S JUST GOIN TO COLLAPSE ON YOU
POD1000000030_S0000009	SO THAT THE PLAE
POD1000000030_S0000011	MAINLY GIVES STRUCTURE TO THE SHOE BUT IT DOES GIVE A SMALL BENEFIT IN TERMS OF ENERGY COST
POD1000000030_S0000012	COMBINE THAT WITH NOW YOU CAN DO HIGHER FOAM BECAUSE YOU CAN HOLD EVERYTHING TOGETHER WITH THE PLATE
POD1000000030_S0000013	AND YOU'VE GOT A REALLY GOOD PUSHING INTO THE GROUND BIG DISPLACEMENT OF THE FOOT WHILE IT INTERACTS WITH THE GROUND AND THEN PUSHES OFF REALLY EFFECTIVELY
POD1000000030_S0000014	SO IT QUITE LITERALLY PUTS A SPRING IN YOUR STEP
POD1000000030_S0000015	YEAH IT'S NOT A COILED SPRING LIKE WE'RE USED TO BUT ANY FOAM IS REALLY A SPRING THIS ONE'S JUST REALLY EFFECTIVE AT IT
POD1000000030_S0000016	BUT WHERE'S THE LINE THAT'S WHAT THE QUESTION IS NOW AND I THINK THESE ARE EITHER AT THE LINE WHERE I'D FEEL COMFORTABLE OR A LITTLE BIT BEYOND
POD1000000030_S0000017	SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT THERE COULD STILL BE SOME INNOVATION ALLOWED IN SHOES WE'RE NOT GOING TO SAY EVERYBODY MUST WEAR THE SAME TYPE OF SHOWE BUT THERE MUST BE A LIMIT TO IT
POD1000000030_S0000018	YEAH I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL TO HAVE THE INNOVATION AND WHAT NIKE'S DONE HAS PROPELLED OTHER COMPANIES TO CATCH UP AND THEY WILL CATCH UP
POD1000000030_S0000019	SO WE COULD HAVE THE STANDARD FOR MARATHONING OR ROAD RACING IS A SHO LIKE THE VAPOR FLY BUT THEN NIKE OR SOMEONE WILL GO A LITTLE FURTHER WITH IT
POD1000000030_S0000020	AND WE'LL END UP WITH LIKE SIXTY MILLIMETER FOAM AND ENOUGH CARBON FIBERE TO HOLD THE STRUCTURE OF IT SO YOU'RE NOT COLLAPSING BUT IT'LL JUST CONTINUE ON
POD1000000030_S0000021	AND AT SOME POINT THE RULES NEED TO JUST STANDARDIZE HERE'S WHAT A SHOE IS
POD1000000030_S0000022	THE PRICE OF THESE SHOES TO US AMATERS OUT THERE SEEMS INCREDIBLY HIGH IS IT SORT OF WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT FOR A TOP OF THE LINE RUNNING SHOE
POD1000000030_S0000023	YEAH WHEN TEY SAY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS FOR A PAIR OF SHOES THAT NIKE HAS MENTIONED PROBABLY WILL LAST YOU ABOUT NINETY MILES BEFORE IT'S LOSING SOME OF ITS EFFECTIVENESS
POD1000000030_S0000024	THAT IS GETTING TO THE POINT OF NOT OUTRAGEOUS BUT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE RESTRICTED BY THE COST OF IT AND THEY'LL BE LOOKING FOR CHEAPER OPTIONS
POD1000000030_S0000025	IF NEW BALANCE AKANY OTHERS START COMPETING WITH THE SAME QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF SHO AND ARE CHARGING A HUNDRED FIFTY NIKE'S GOIN TO HAVE TO START DROPPING THEIR COST DOWN
POD1000000030_S0000026	SO AT'S JUST THE NATURAL HOW MARKETING WORKS A AND IT'LL ALL COME TO AN EQUILIBRIUM OVER TIME
POD1000000030_S0000027	I REMEMBER READING ABOUT THE ADVANTAGES THAT SOME FORMS OF ARTIFICIAL LEGS COULD GIVE RUNNERS POTENTIALLY OVER RUNNERS WITH LIKE NATURAL BORN LEGS I MEAN ARE WE JUST REACHING A POINT WHERE KIND OF SPORT IS HARD ENGINEERING
POD1000000030_S0000028	IT IS AND AND I THINK IT SHOULD BE BUT THER HAVE TO BE SOME RESTRICTIONS TO HOW FAR YOU GO
POD1000000030_S0000029	WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO BE TEMPTED TO AMPUTATE THEIR LOWER LEGS SO THEY CAN GO FROM A TWO FIFTEEN MARATHONER TO A TWO O FIVE MARATHONER
POD1000000030_S0000030	OUR LEGS AREN'T BUILT JUST FOR RUNNING THEY'RE BUILT FOR CLIMBING AND SWIMMING AND JUMPING AND ALL KINDS OF ACTIVITIES
POD1000000030_S0000031	SO IF YOU TUNE THE LAG TO BE TUNED JUST FOR RUNNING THEY'LL BE GREAT AT RUNNING BUT NOT GOOD AT OTHER THINGS
POD1000000030_S0000032	AND THAT THAT'S WHERE YOU COULD GO IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE RULES ESTABLISHED
POD1000000030_S0000033	GIVEN THAT THESE SHOES DO KIND OF HAVE A LIMITED LIFE DO ATHLETES TRAIN IN THEM AND ACTUALLY RUN IN THEM IN RACES OR DO YOU SORT OF HOLD THEM OFF FOR THAT THAT PERFORMANCE BOOST WHEN YOU REALLY NEED IT
POD1000000030_S0000034	WELL IF THEY'RE SPONSORED BY NIKE THEY'LL DO ALL OF THEIR RACE PACE WORK IN THOSE SHOES
POD1000000030_S0000035	BUT IF THEY'RE BUYING THEIR OWN SHOES WHAT I TYPICALLY SEE IS THEY BUY THE PAIR DO MAYBE TWO WORKOUTS IN THEM BEFORE THE RACE SO THEY PROBABLY HAVE ABOUT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MILES ON THEM AND THEN THEY DO THE RACE
POD1000000030_S0000036	AND THEN THEY'LL MAYBE WORK OUT IN THOSE ONES BUT BUY A NEW PAIR BEFORE THE NEXT RACE THEY DO
POD1000000030_S0000037	AND THAT'S IF IT'S SOMEONE THAT CARES ABOUT SAVING A COUPLE MINUTES ON A MARATHON TIME
POD1000000030_S0000038	I THINK IT'S SOMEWHERE AROUND ONE OR TWO MINUTES THE BENEFIT THAT MOST WOULD GET FROM THIS SHUE
POD1000000030_S0000039	THE PRICE OF PROGRESS I GUESS IAN HUNTER THERE WHO WORKS WITH USA TRACK AND FIELD
POD1000000030_S0000041	DNOW FOR SOME RELATED LINKS NIKE'S SHOES FIRST CAME TO PROMINENCE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WHEN THEY WERE WORN BY THE FIRST THREE FINISHERS IN THE RIO OLYMPICS MEN'S MARRATHON
POD1000000030_S0000042	AN ESTIMATED NINETY FIVE OF THE FIRST ONE HUNDRED FINISHERS IN LAST YEAR'S VELENCIA MARATHON WERE WEARING VAPORFLY SHOES
POD1000000030_S0000043	THAT'S JUST TWO OF THE STATISTICS THAT REYTERS HAS PULLED TOGETHER TO SHOW THE DOMINANCE OF THIS TECH IN VARIOUS DIFFERENT VERSIONS SOME GRAPHS IN THEIR ARTICLE TWO FOR MY FELLOW DATA NERDS
POD1000000030_S0000044	I ALSO GOT LOST IN A NEW WALL STREET JOURNAL VIDEO ON THE SHOES AND THE CONTROVERSY AROUND THEM WHICH AS IT SAYS SOME ARE CALLING A SISMIC SHIFT
POD1000000030_S0000045	SO WE'LL LINK YOU TO THAT AND A VOICE YOU HEAR ON MARKETPLACE TEC FROM TIME TO TIME NICK THOMPSON EDITOR IND CHIEF OF WIRED MAGAZINE IS ALSO A KEEN MARATHONR
POD1000000030_S0000046	AND HE SET OUT TO PUT THESE SNEAKERS TO THE TEST HIMSELF BY RUNNING THE NEW YORK MARATHON WEARING THEM AND CRUNCHING ALL OF HIS DATA
POD1000000030_S0000047	THEY FELT STRANGE AND WOBBLY AT FIRST HE SAYS MY INITIAL STEPS REMINDED ME OF PUTTING ON ICE SGATES AND THEN WALKING ON A RUBBER MAT TO THE RINK
POD1000000030_S0000048	BUT ONCE I STARTED RUNNING THE STRANGENESS DISAPPEARED AND I FORGOT I WAS WEARING THEM
POD1000000030_S0000049	MORE OF HIS EXPERIENCES AND HIS CRUNCHING OF THE SCIENTIFIC DATA TO SEE IF HE EXPERIENCED THE TECH DOPING EFFECT AT MARKETPLACETECH DOT ORG
POD1000000030_S0000050	I'M JACK STUWART AND THAT IS MARKETPLACE TECH
POD1000000030_S0000052	THIS IS A PM
POD1000000031_S0000001	THE HOLIDAYS ARE OVER IT'S BACK TO REALITY FOR MOST OF US AND BACK TO SOME DISTANT WAREHOUSE FOR A LOT OF OUR UNWANTED GIFTS
POD1000000031_S0000002	FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA THIS IS MARKETPLACE TECH DEMYSTIFYING THE DIGITAL ECONOMY
POD1000000031_S0000003	I'M JACK STUWART INFOR MOLLY WOOD
POD1000000031_S0000005	THIS SEASON'S ONLINE HOLIDAY SALES WERE WORTH SOME ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS TO E RETAILERS
POD1000000031_S0000006	BUT NEARLY A THIRD OF THAT STUFF IS EXPECTED TO BE RETURNED ACCORDING TO NEW RESEARCH FROM CBRE A REAL ESTATE RESEARCH GROUP
POD1000000031_S0000007	AND THAT'S PRETTY TYPICAL THIRTY PERCENT OF ONLINE SHOPPING IS RETURNED VERSUS EIGHT PERCENT OF STUFF BOUGHT IN SHOPS
POD1000000031_S0000008	AND ALL OF THOSE RETURNS COME WITH A COST EVEN IF THEY'RE FREE TO US THE SHOPPERS
POD1000000031_S0000009	THERE'S THE EMISSIONS FROM THE TRUCKS AND PLANES THE WASTE FROM PACKAGING AND DISCARDED PRODUCTS THE COST OF FINDING SPACE FOR IT ALL OR EVEN JUST CHUCKING IT OUT
POD1000000031_S0000010	DAVID EAGAN WITH CBRE SAYS RIGHT ABOUT NOW WAREHOUSE WORKERS ARE GETTING BURIED
POD1000000031_S0000011	WELL IT'S JUST THE FLOOD OF PACKAGES WHEWHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE WAY THE SUPPLY CHAIN IS BUILT AND DESIGNED IT REALLY IS MEANT TO BE AS EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE IN MOVING PRODUCT FROM THE POINT OF PRODUCTION OWHEREVER SOMETHING IS MADE TO THE END POINT THE POINT OF CONSUMPTION
POD1000000031_S0000012	AND ALL OF THE NETWORKS OU KOW THE THE BUILDINGS THAE FLOW THROUGH THE BUILDINGS THE TRANSPORTATION NETWORKS EVEN THE WAY THE EMPLOYEES ARE TRAINED TO HANDLE THE PACKAGES ARE REALLY MEANT TO GET THAT STUFF MOVING OUT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE
POD1000000031_S0000013	ARE THERE WAYS THAT WE COULD USE TECHNOLOGY TO TRY TO MITIGATE THIS PROBLEM
POD1000000031_S0000014	IN MY OPINION THE REAL SOLUTION IS GOING TO BE A TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTION AT THE POINT OF SALE SO HOW DO YOU PROVIDE THE CUSTOMER BETTER ASSURANCE THAT WHAT THEY'RE BUYING IS WHAT THEY ACTUALLY WANT
POD1000000031_S0000015	SO THE CLASSIC EXAMPLE IS SOMEONE BUYS THREE OR FOUR SHIRTS WITH THE INTENTION OF ONLY KEEPING ONE OR TWO OF THEM BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW IF THE SIZE IS RIGHT THEYDON'T KNOW THE COLOR IS QUITE GONTA BE RGHT THEYDO'T KNOWHAT T'S GONNA FEEL LIKE
POD1000000031_S0000016	AND I DO THINK THERE ARE TECHNOLOGIES BETWEEN AUGMENTED REALITY AND VIRTUAL REALITY WHERE WE'LL BE ABLE TO SHOP ONLINE AND HAVE A MORE A SENSE OF AN IN PERSON TYPE OF EXPERIENCE WHICH I BELIEVE WILL REALLY SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF RETURNS THAT OCCUR
POD1000000031_S0000017	THE OTHER SIDE OF IT THOUGH IS THAT OFFERING THAT TYPE OF FREE FRICTIONLESS SEAMLESS RETURN POLICY IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO KEEPING CUSTOMERS
POD1000000031_S0000018	DO YOU THINK WE AS CONSUMERS HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY HERE I MEAN RETURNS ARE SO EASY MOST OF THE TIME THEY'RE FREE THEYRE MAY BE SOMETHING WE DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT AS MUCH AS WE SHOULD
POD1000000031_S0000019	I THINK WE NEED TO INCUR SOME OF THE COST FRANKLY I DO THINK THAT THE FREE AND PAINLESS RETURN SYSTEM THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN ACUSTOMED TO DEALING WITH IS LONG TERM NOT SUSTAINABLE
POD1000000031_S0000020	SO I DO THINK AT SOME PLACE WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW DAMAGING IT IS NOT ONLY TO THE THE RETAILERS THAT WE'RE WE'RE DOING BUSINESS WITH BUT ALSO TO THE ENVIRONMENT
POD1000000031_S0000021	KNOW ONE FACT THAT I FIND SHOCKING FRANKLY IS THAT IN THE UNITED STATES ALONE FIVE BILLION POUNDS OF RETURND MERCHANDISE GETS PUT IN THE LANDFILL EVERY SINGLE YEAR JUST IN THE U S
POD1000000031_S0000022	SO MERCHANDISE THAT'S BEEN HANDLED AND ENOUGH TIME HAS PASSED BETWEEN THE POINT OF SALE TO THE RETURN POINT THAT IT'S EEN DEEMED WORTHLESS AND IT GETS THROWN AWAY FIVE BILLION POUNDS A YEAR
POD1000000031_S0000023	SO I MEAN THAT IT'S JUST IT'S IT' A DESTRUCTIVE TYPE OF TYPE OF SYSTEM THAT WE'RE ALL TAKING PART IN I THINK WE ALL NEED TO DO OUR PART TO MAKE IT GO AWAY
POD1000000031_S0000024	AND ONE OF THE WAYS TO DO THAT IS TO PAY FOR IT AND WHEN PEOPLE ARE ASKED TO PAY FOR SOMETHING THEY'LL BE A LOT MORE CAREFUL ABOUT THE WAY THEY BEHAVE
POD1000000031_S0000025	NOW THE FLIPSIDE TO THAT IS THAT THE CONSUMERS HAVE VOTED OVERWHELMINGLY IN FAVOR OF FREE AND FRICTIONLESS RETURNS AND HAVE SAID THAT THEY WILL FIND SOMEONE IF IF YOU WON'T GIVE IT TO ME SOMEONE ELSE WILL
POD1000000031_S0000026	SO FIXING THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY IT'S REALLY HARD TO IMAGINE THE FIRST RETAILER THAT'S GOING TO BE BRAVE ENOUGH TO TURN AROUND AND SAY SURE WE'LL TAKE YOUR RETURNS BUT IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO COST YOU
POD1000000031_S0000027	THAT WAS DAVID EGAN WITH CBRE
POD1000000031_S0000029	AND NOW FOR SOME RELATED LINKS
POD1000000031_S0000030	IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO TALK ABOUT ONLINE SHOPPING WITHOUT MENTIONING THE BAHEMTH THAT IS AMAZON AS ADWEEK SAYS WHERE IT GOES OTHER RETAILERS FOLLOW
POD1000000031_S0000031	AND IN THE LAST DECADE IT HAS SET NEW STANDARDS AND EXPECTATIONS FOR DELIVERY PUSHING ITS COMPETITORS TO DO THE SAME
POD1000000031_S0000032	AD WEEK HAS THE FIVE WAYS WHICH AMAZON CHANGED SHOPPING IN THE TWENTY TENS
POD1000000031_S0000033	WITH RETURNS OFTEN BEING FREE IT'S REALLY NOT SURPRISING THAT CONSUMERS AREN'T AWARE OF THE REAL COSTS
POD1000000031_S0000034	OR MAYBE WED JUST LIKE TO ASSUME OR HOPE THAT THOSE UNWANTED ITEMS THAT WE SO CAREFULLY RETURN WITH ALL THEIR ORIGINAL PACKAGING INTACT ARE THEN RESTOCKED AND RESOLD
POD1000000031_S0000035	THE IDEA THAT A GOOD CHUNK OF THEM END UP IN LANDFILL IS WELL AS THE L A TIMES CALLS IT A HIDDEN ENVIRONMENTAL CRISIS
POD1000000031_S0000036	DAVID EGAN EXPLAINED THAT THE LOGISTICS OPERATION IS SET UP TO RUN SMOOTHLY IN ONE DIRECTION GETTING THINGS TO US
POD1000000031_S0000037	THERE ARE A LOT OF EFFORTS TO STREAMLINE THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TOO THOUGH THERE ARE COMPANIES MAKING IT THEIR BUSINESS TO HELP RETAILERS AND CONSUMERS
POD1000000031_S0000038	SO IF YOU DO EVER STEP OUT FROM BEHIND YOUR COMPUTER AND ACTUALLY GO TO MALLS A LITTLE MORE FREQUENTLY THAN ME YOU'E PROBABLY NOTICED SOME RETURN BARS WHERE YOU CAN DROP OFF PURCHASES AND HAVE SOMEONE ELSE JUST DEAL WITH ALL THAT SENDING IT BACK STUFF FOR YOU
POD1000000031_S0000039	AND FOR THE SELLERS THESE COMPANIES PROMISE TO ANALYZE RETURNS AND THE REASONS FOR THEM AND REDUCE THE PACKAGING THEY NEED VOGUE BUSINESS BREAKS IT DOWN
POD1000000031_S0000040	UT I THINK REALLY THE NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION THAT I'M TAKING AWAY FROM ALL OF THIS IS JUST TO BUY LESS STUFF I'M JACK STWART AND THAT'S MARKETPLACE TECH
POD1000000031_S0000042	THIS IS A PM

POD1000000032_S0000002	CAN TECH HELP US BUILD THEM
POD1000000032_S0000003	FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA THIS IS MARKETPLACE TECH DEMYSTIFYING THE DIGITAL ECONOMY
POD1000000032_S0000004	I'M MOLLY WOOD
POD1000000032_S0000006	STATES AND CITIES ARE RUSHING TO FIND HOSPITAL BEDS TO PREPARE FOR AN INCREASE IN PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM COVID NINETEEN
POD1000000032_S0000007	IN NEW YORK MAKESHIFT HOSPITALS ARE GOING UP IN CENTRAL PARK A NAVY HOSPITAL SHIP IS IN THE CITY'S HARBOR
POD1000000032_S0000008	ITS JAVITS CONVENTION CENTER HAS BEEN CONVERTED INTO A TEMPORARY MEDICAL FACILITY AND THE U S ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS IS LOOKING TO CONVERT EMPTY HOTELS AND OTHER BUILDINGS INTO HOSPITALS ACROSS THE COUNTRY
POD1000000032_S0000009	NOW AS PART OF ITS RESPONSE TO THE CORONA VIRUS THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT BUILT TWO GIANT HOSPITALS IN TEN DAYS
POD1000000032_S0000010	AND WE WONDERED COULD WE BUILD HOSPITALS THAT FAST HERE IN THE U S AND WHAT TECH EXISTS TO INNOVATE ON THE CONSTRUCTION PROCESS
POD1000000032_S0000011	CHRIS JETINA IS WORKING ON IT HE'S THE CEO OF THE MANUFACTURING AND DESIGN FIRM BLOCX WHICH SPECIALIZES IN MODULAR MEDICAL FACILITY CONSTRUCTION
POD1000000032_S0000012	WE DELIVER ACUTE CARE FACILITIES THINK ABOUT HOSPITALS AND WE DESIGN THEM DIGITALLY AND AND WE MANUFACTURE THEM IN OUR PLANT
POD1000000032_S0000013	AND IMAGINE A BIG COMPLEX LEGO THAT WE CAN CHIP OUT AND THEN WHEN WE WHN N WE GET THERE WE ASSEMBLE IT AS A COMPLETED BUILDING
POD1000000032_S0000014	AND ALL OF THIS RELIES ON A BUNCH OF TECHNOLOGY THAT WE UVSE THE THE THE DIGITAL DESIGN AND THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND THE MACHINES THAT MAKE THESE PARTS REAL TOGETHER
POD1000000032_S0000015	BUT BUT AT THE END WE TAKE RAW MATERIAL AND WE TURN IT INTO HOSPITALS
POD1000000032_S0000016	AND ABOUT HOW LONG DOES THAT TAKE
POD1000000032_S0000017	A TYPICAL BUILDING MAY TAKE TWELVE TO SIXTEEN MONTHS TO MAKE
POD1000000032_S0000018	AND WE DO IT IN FOUR MONTHS NOW AND EVERY DAY WE'RE YOU KNOW WE HAVE A TEAM THAT'S WORKING TO MAKE IT FASTER AND FASTER
POD1000000032_S0000019	YEAH YOU KNOW I ASKE THAT BECAUSE NO PRESSURE BUT IT SEEMS AS THOUGH WE ARE GOING TO NEED SOME HEALTH CARE FACILITIES QUICKLY
POD1000000032_S0000020	HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU SEE YOU KNOW YOUR COMPANY BEING A PART OF THAT
POD1000000032_S0000021	SO A FEW WEEKS AGO WHEN THE SIZE OF THIS PANDEMIC BECAME CLEAR
POD1000000032_S0000022	OUR TEAM HAD TO REFOCUS I EAN WE WERE MAKING PERMANENT HOSPITALS AND WE WERE DOING THEM REALLY FAST BUT WE HAD TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO TAKE THIS PROBLEM AND PUT IT THROUGH OUR MACHINE BLOCKS
POD1000000032_S0000023	AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT SO THAT WE COULD GET HOSPITAL BEDS QUICKER
POD1000000032_S0000024	WE SET OUT IMMEDIATELY TO DESIGN A TWENTY FOUR BED MICU
POD1000000032_S0000025	
POD1000000032_S0000026	A MICU IS IT'S A MOBILE ISOLATION CARE UNIT THIS MICU IT'S GOT THREE JOBS
POD1000000032_S0000027	AND THE FIRST ONE IS IT'S GOT TO PROTECT THE FRONTLINE HEALTH CARE WORKER
POD1000000032_S0000028	AND AND THEN THERE'S THIS THE SECOND THING THAT THEY'VE GOT TO DO WHICH IS THEY THEY'RE DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE HOSPITAL'S EXISTING CAPACITY
POD1000000032_S0000029	AND THEN THE FINAL ONE IS WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE THESE MICKUS BECOME A PERMANENT AND FLEXIBLE ASSET THAT HATHAT HELP SERVE THE HEALTH SYSTEM GOING FORWARD
POD1000000032_S0000030	I MEAN THEY'RE INSTITUTIONAL GRADE THEY'RE REUSABLE
POD1000000032_S0000031	AIT'S A FLEET OF ICE ROOMS THAT GETS TO BE MOVED IN THE FUTURE TO WHEREVER THE HOT SPOT IS
POD1000000032_S0000032	HOW MUCH DO THEY COST
POD1000000032_S0000033	THESE THINGS WILL BE AROUND TWO TO THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A BED IN THE BEGINNING AND THEN THOSE THOSE PRICES WILL DROP DOWN
POD1000000032_S0000034	SO THESE ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS EXPENSIVE BUT THEY'RE STILL HIGH TECH DEVICES THAT ARE CHALKFULL OF EQUIPMENT AND PRESSURIZATION AND ELECTRONICS AND THE'RE STILL PRETTY EXPENSIVE BOXES
POD1000000032_S0000035	CAN YOU TELL US AT ALL WHERE THESE PROJECTS MIGHT BE HAPPENING LIKE WHERE YOU'RE PUTTING UP THESE MICKIS
POD1000000032_S0000036	WELL WE'RE WE'RE NOT PUTTING THEM UP YET SO IT'S STILL IT'S STILL GOING TO PRODUCTION IN TWO WEEKS
POD1000000032_S0000037	THE FIRST ONES COULD BE IN ANY OF THE SPOTS THAT ARE NEEDED
POD1000000032_S0000038	SO OBVIOUSLY WE'VE BEEN IN PRETTY HEAVY DISCUSSIONS IN NEW YORK WE'VE BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS IN IN GEORGIA AND THERE'S A BIG THERE'S A BIG DELTA BETWEEN THOSE TWO PLACES BUT IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER TO US WHERE THEY'RE NEEDED
POD1000000032_S0000039	THEY CAN GO JUST AS EASILY TO ONE OR THE OTHER
POD1000000032_S0000040	AND THEN JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY IS IT SORT OF LIKE A MODULAR HOUSE WHERE IT'S BASICALLY SORT OF PREBUILT AND THEN IT JUST COMES ON A BIG TRUCK
POD1000000032_S0000041	YOU KNOW IT PARTS OF IT ARE SO ALEGO ANALOGYIS REALLY A PRETTY GOOD
POD1000000032_S0000042	IF YOU THINK ABOUT ALEGO KIT OR ADVANCED ONE IT HAS IT HAS DIFFERENT TYPES OF PARTS
POD1000000032_S0000043	OME OF THEM ARE VOLUMETRIC AND SOME OF THEM ARE ARE CUSTOM PARTS AND SOME OF THEM ARE LITTLE PIECES THAT CAN BE USED IN A THOUSAND DIFFERENT DIFFERENT WAYS
POD1000000032_S0000044	AND AND WE ARE AGNOSTIC ABOUT IT WE THINK THAT THERE'S JUST A A VALUE STREAM THAT GOES FROM RAW MATERIAL AND IT'S CONVERTED INTO A USABLE BUILDING
POD1000000032_S0000045	AND AND THE PROCESS THAT IT GOES THROUGH IS A WHOLE LOT OF DIFFERENT STAGES
POD1000000032_S0000046	WE'RE JUST TRYING TO FIND AN OPTIMAL ONE
POD1000000032_S0000047	THERE'S NOT ALWAYS A RIGHT PATH BECAUSE OF ININ FACT WE'RE USING MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO FOR A REGULAR HOSPITAL RIGHT NOW
POD1000000032_S0000048	BUT WE'VE WE'VE MADE DIFFERENT CHANGES THE FOUNDATION FOR EXAMPLE IS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT ON A MICKU
POD1000000032_S0000049	IT DOESN'T NEED ALL OF THE PERMANENCE THAT THAT A ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL MAY HAVE YOU KNOW THAT HAS A FIFTY YEAR LIFESPAN
POD1000000032_S0000050	SO SO TH THE IDEA IS WE WE THINK OF IT AS COMPLETED PARTS BUT EVERY PART'S COMPLETED
POD1000000032_S0000051	AND IT GOES TOGETHER IN A FORM OF CHUNK
POD1000000032_S0000052	IT'S KIND OF THE WAY THEY BUILD A NEW BOWING SEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN DREAM LINER IT'S NOT MADE ON AN ASSEMBLY LINE THE WAY YOU YOU KNOW YOU THINK OF AN ASSEMBLY LINE
POD1000000032_S0000053	IT'S MADE IN CHUNKS THAT ARE MADE ALL OVER THE WORLD AND THEY'VE ALL BROUGHT TOGETHER IN CHARLESTON AND PUT TOGETHER AS AN OEM IN A MATTER OF DAYS
POD1000000032_S0000054	SO THAT'S MORE LIKE WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH WITH BLOCKS
POD1000000032_S0000055	GOT IT WHAT MAKES THESE SPECIFIC TO MEDICAL FACILITIES
POD1000000032_S0000056	WHAT KIND OF CERTIFICATION AND TECHNOLOGY GOES INTO THAT
POD1000000032_S0000057	HOSPITALS ARE REALLY HEAVILY REGULATED
POD1000000032_S0000058	AND IF YOU IF YOU TRY AND UNDERSTAND WHICH ONES THERE ARE YOU IT'S IT'S A IT'S A LONG LIST
POD1000000032_S0000059	SO WHAT I WOULD JUST SIMPLY SAY IS THESE THINGS ARE' DEALING WITH LIFE SAFETY AT AN INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL THEY'RE DEALING WITH EMERGENCY POWER CRITICAL CARE OPERATIONS
POD1000000032_S0000060	E'RE DEALING WITH TEMPERATURE CONTROL THAT'S BASED ON AIR EXCHANGES WHICH ALLOW YOU TO EVACUATE DISEASE AND INFECTION
POD1000000032_S0000061	THEY'RE DESIGNED TO BE VISIBLE AND OPERATIONAL HIGH PERFORMANCES IF YOU WILL
POD1000000032_S0000062	SO THESE THESE NURSES AND DOCTORS ARE UNDER AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF PRESSURE
POD1000000032_S0000063	AND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS CREATE A PLACE WHICH IS SAFE FOR THEM TO WORK BUT VISUALLY CONTROLLED SO T THEY CAN SEE EVERYTHING AT WONCE
POD1000000032_S0000064	AND YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT WE FOCUSED ON WE HOW DO WE MAKE THIS REALLY A BEAUTIFUL ELEGANTLY SIMPLE OPERATIONALLY VISUALLY CONTROLLED DEVICE THAT IS TECHNOLOGICALLY EMPOWERED
POD1000000032_S0000065	AND CAN BE DEPLOYED REALLY FAST AND STILL BE DONE WITH THE STUFF THAT'S AVAILABLE TODAY NOT TH STUFF THAT WE WISHE WAS AVAILABLE TODAY
POD1000000032_S0000066	YOU SAID THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO TAKE A TYPICAL CONSTRUCTION TIME FOR A BUILDING FROM TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS DOWN TO FOUR MONTHS
POD1000000032_S0000067	HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO CONSTRUCT THESE MIKUS
POD1000000032_S0000068	SO THE THE FIRST ONE WILL ROLL OFF IN JUNE THE ATHE END OF MAY AND IT'LL BE OPERATIONAL A WEEK LATER
POD1000000032_S0000069	AND THEN AFTER THAT THEY'LL JUST KEEP COMING AS LONG AS THEY'RE NEEDED
POD1000000032_S0000070	SO ONCE THE LINE IS LOADED THEN THINK OF IT AS JUST A CONTINUOUS RIVER THAT KEEPS DROPPING THEM OUT
POD1000000032_S0000071	SO THERE'S ABOUT TEN LARGE MODULES IN EACH ONE OF THESE AND EVERY DAY AND A HALF ANOTHER TEN WILL BE READY TO BE SHIPPED
POD1000000032_S0000072	LET ME ASK YOU THIS IT'S CLEARLY A TECHNOLOGICAL MIRACLE IN A LOT OF WAYS
POD1000000032_S0000073	JUNE IS A LONG WAYS AWAY DO YOU WISH THAT YOU HAD STARTED GETTING CALLS SOONER
POD1000000032_S0000075	YES NECESSITY IS THE MOTHER OF INVENTION AND I THINK THAT WE'RE AS A NATION IN THE MIDST OF A NECESSITY
POD1000000032_S0000076	LIKE WHAT I SEE IN TERMS OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT COMING TOGETHER TO TRY AND SOLVE HARD PROBLEMS RIGHT NOW
POD1000000032_S0000077	CHRIS TATINA IS CEO OF THE MODULAR MEDICAL FACILITY CONSTRUCTION FIRM BLOCKS
POD1000000032_S0000078	HE SAID THE COMPANY IS TALKING RIGHT NOW WITH A FEW STATES ABOUT BUILDING THE MIKUS HE MENTIONED
POD1000000032_S0000079	BUT SO FAR HASN'T FINALIZED ANY DEALS
POD1000000032_S0000081	AND NOW FOR SOME RELATED LINKS TO THAT POINT ABOUT WHETHER BLOX IS ALREADY BUILDING FACILITIES
POD1000000032_S0000082	FAST COMPANY HAS A PIECE ON HOW YES WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY AND THE MODULAR CONSTRUCTION EXPERTISE TO GET BUILDINGS UP QUICKLY
POD1000000032_S0000083	BUT WE ALSO HAVE A LOT OF LOGISTICS AND RED TAPE PROBLEMS
POD1000000032_S0000084	THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS AS YOU HEARD WANTS TO CONVERT EXISTING FACILITIES
POD1000000032_S0000085	BUT FOR THE REASONS THAT JATINA MENTIONED A HOTEL OR CONVENTION CENTER IS NOT IDEAL FOR THE JOB THOSE BUILDINGS ARE HARD TO STERILIZE
POD1000000032_S0000086	THEY NEED HVAX SYSTEMS THAT CAN PREVENT INFECTIOUS DISEASES FROM BEING PUMPED INTO EVERY ROOM AND THEY HAVE PLENTY OF OTHER MEDICAL NEEDS AS WELL
POD1000000032_S0000087	THE PIECE POINTS TO SOME MODULAR DESIGN COMPANIES THAT ARE CREATING MEDICAL PODS THAT CAN BE BUILT QUICKLY
POD1000000032_S0000088	SOME OTHERS IN ADDITION TO BLOCKS
POD1000000032_S0000089	BUT SINCE EACH CITY AND STATE HAS ITS OWN RULES AROUND CONSTRUCTION AND PERMITS AND EVEN JUST A SHORTAGE OF ACTUAL LAND TO PUT MODULES ON
POD1000000032_S0000090	IT'S A TOUGH PROBLEM TO SOLVE QUICKLY AT A TIME WHEN SPEED IS WHAT WE NEED
POD1000000032_S0000092	AND HERE'S WHAT ELSE WE'RE WATCHING IN TECH
POD1000000032_S0000093	THE WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORTS THAT NO SURPRISE THE U S IS ALREADY STARTING TO TRACK PEOPLE'S SMARTPHONE DATA TO ANALYZE MOVEMENTS AND ULTIMATELY BUILD A DATABASE THAT CAN SHOW AT A NATIONAL LEVEL
POD1000000032_S0000094	HOW WELL SOCIAL DISTANCING MEASURES ARE WORKING AND WHERE PEOPLE MIGHT BE GATHERING TOGETHER IN LARGE GROUPS SO THAT AUTHORITIES CAN BOTH CRACK DOWN AND POTENTIALLY PREDICT A FUTURE OUTBREAK
POD1000000032_S0000095	AND LOOK WE'RE GOING TO TALK A LOT MORE ABOUT THIS LATER IN THE WEEK THIS NEED FOR A DATA DRIVEN RESPONSE TO THIS OUTBREAK AND THE FACT THAT THIS IS USEFUL EXISTING DATA
POD1000000032_S0000096	AND THE FACT THAT IT IS ALSO LIKELY TO BECOME A PRIVACY INVASION AT A GRAND SCALE
POD1000000032_S0000097	TECH CRUNCH HAS A PIECE ABOUT HOW SINGAPORE IS COLLECTING DATA IN A MORE PRIVACY FRIENDLY WAY THROUGH AN APP CALLED TRACE TOGETHER
POD1000000032_S0000098	THAT'S WHAT MIT IS TRYING TO DO WITH ITS APP SAFE PATHS BUT BOTH CASES RELY ON PEOPLE DOWNLOADING THE APP AND USING IT AND VOLUNTARILY REPORTING INFORMATION
POD1000000032_S0000099	IN SINGAPORE THERE IS A MORE CENTRAL AUTHORITY THAT CAN YOU KNOW MAKE PEOPLE DO THE THING
POD1000000032_S0000100	THAT'S A LOT HARDER IN THE U S AND SINCE THE DATA ALREADY EXIST IN ONE GIANT COOKIE JAR FULL OF DELICIOUS QUARANTINE BAKED COOKIES
POD1000000032_S0000101	IT'S GONNA BE REAL HARD TO CONVINCE THE COOKIE MONSTER TO FIND ANOTHER TREAT

POD1000000034_S0000011	OBVIOUSLY A GOOD DEAL OF AMAZON IS KIND OF ESSENTIAL IN THESE TIMES OU KNOW PARTICULARLY IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WITH MOBILITY ISSUES YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO FOR FOR HEALTH REASONS DOESN'T WANT TO EVEN TAKE THE RISK OF GOING TO A GOING TO A SUPERMARKET OR BIGBOX STORE THAT REMAINS OPEN YOU KNOW YOU'RE RELIANT ON ECOMMERCE AND
POD1000000034_S0000012	YOU KNOW NON THAT REGARD IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET DRY GOODS OR HAND SANITIZER OR WIPES CHANCES ARE USING AMAZON DOT COM BUT ONE OF THE DRAWBACKS THAT WE'VE FOUND OF OF THIS ENVIRONMENT AT LEAST IF YOU TALK TO AMAZON'S WORKERS IS THAT THEY'RE STILL SHIPPING A LOT OF NON ESSENTIAL STUFF
POD1000000034_S0000013	AMAZON'S DIGITAL DOORS REMAIN OPEN FOR FOR BOOKS FOR YOU KNOW TOYS GAMES FOR KIND OF EVERYTHING ELSE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN SELLING ONLINE ANYWAY THEY'RE STILL SHIPPING THAT ND THERE'S WORKERS IN FACILITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY YOU KNOW STILL RISKING THEIR OWN HEALTH GOING INTO WORK
POD1000000034_S0000014	IN THE SERVICE OF OFMOVING THOSE GOODS TO YOUR DOOR TOO
POD1000000034_S0000015	WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ECOMMERCE BUT AMAZON ALSO HAS A LOT OF OTHER BUSINESSES RIGHT
POD1000000034_S0000016	RIGHT RIGHT AND THERE'S THERE'S A BUNCH OF OTHER AREAS THAT YOU KNOW THEY STAND TO TO LIKELY BENEFIT FROM THIS YOU KNOW ONE OF THEM IT DOESN'T GET TALKED ABOUT QUITE AS MUCH AS AS DELIVERY BUT AMAZON WEB SERVICES THEIR CLOUD COMPUTING GROUP WHICH YOU KNOW IT'S ESSENTIALLY ON DEMAND SOFTWARE OR OR PROCESSING POWER
POD1000000034_S0000017	YOU KNOW BUSINESSES WITH EMPLOYEES WORKING FROM HOME ARE ARE MAKING MORE USE OF THAT ANALYSTS SAY AND THEN YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE SITTING HOME WATCHING NETFLIX ROR USING A VARIETY OF INTERNET SERVICES A LOT OF THE BACKBONES OF THOSE LIVE ON AMAZON WEB SERVICES AND SO
POD1000000034_S0000018	I'S JHUST KIND OF THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM THAT THEY STAND TO GAIN TOO FROM THIS THIS ENVIRONMENT RIGHT NOW
POD1000000034_S0000019	YOU KNOW SO MANY OF OUR CONVERSATIONS ARE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS AFTER WE COME OUT OF THIS EVEN THOUGH IT'S HARD TO EVEN ENVISION WHEN THAT IS OR WHAT THE WORLD IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE AT THAT POINT
POD1000000034_S0000020	BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT AMAZON A YEAR FROM NOW WHAT KIND OF STORIES DO YOU THINK YOU'LL BE WRITING ABOUT THIS COMPANY AND AND ITS BUSINESS
POD1000000034_S0000021	I THINK WE'RE GON TA BE WRITING ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW THIS OKNOWAS AS CATASTROPHIC AN EVENT AS IT'S PROVING TO BE GLOBALLY THIS IS KIND OF THE THING THAT AMAZON WAS BUILT FOR YOU KNOW THEY'VE SPENT MOST OF THE LAST DECADE BUILDING A A GIANT LOGISTICS NETWORK IN THE U S AND AND PARTS OF EUROPE TO
POD1000000034_S0000022	REALLY IN AN UNPRECEDENTED WAY GET GOODS TO YOU QUICKER NTO TO EVERY DOORSTEP THEY CAN ACCESS THEY'VE BEEN UTOUTING ECOMMERCE SINCE THAT TERM WAS NEW SO I THINK IN A LOT OF WAYS THE'R COMPANY BUILT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS
POD1000000034_S0000023	OW IT HASN'T BEEN A A GLORIOUS COUPLE OF MONTHS FOR THEM THEY'VE HAD SOME COMPLAITS FROM WORKERS ABOUT UOW NONESSENTIAL GOODS AND HE RATE AT WHICH THEY'VE BEEN WORKED THERE'SE BEEN YOU KNOW TH THE USUAL CRITICISMS FROM US SENATORS ABOUT GIVING WORKERS BETTER PAY
POD1000000034_S0000024	HAS BEEN AN ISSUE AT AMAZON OFF AND ON FOR A WHILE YOU KNOW BUT BUT TO A LARGE EXTENT THIS COMPANY WAS DESIGNED TO HANDLE THESE KIND OF CHALLENGES SO I THINK YOU KNOW IF THIS INDEED MEANS A SORT OF PERMANENT INCREASE IN ONLINE COMMERCE YOU KNOW AMAZON WOULD STAND TO STAND TO GAIN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT FROM IT
POD1000000034_S0000025	N THE QUESTION IS JUST WHETHE THEY'RE ABLE TO CAPITALIZE ON THAT O NOW THE WY THEIR BUSINESS LEADERS WOULD HOPE OR IF SOME OF THE THE PR BACKLASH RELATED TO SOME OF THESE CONTROVERSIES HAMPERS THEM
POD1000000034_S0000026	WE HAVE SEEN PROTESTS THIS WEEK BY DELIVERY WORKERS AND PEOPLE WORKING IN AMAZON'S WAREHOUSES WILL THIS HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS
POD1000000034_S0000027	THE ISSUE WITH WITH AMAZON IT'S BEEN A COMPLICATED STORY FOR A LONG TIME BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THIS CRISIS IS DOING IS SOME OF THOSE FOLKS ARE KIND OF TAKING THE OPRTUNITY TO SPEAK IN A WAY THAT THEY HAVEN'T BEFORE THERE WAS A WALKOUT IN AN AMAZON WAREHOUSE JUST OUTSIDE OF DETROIT
POD1000000034_S0000028	ITWAS THE THIRD YOU KNOW WALKOUT IN THREE DAYS AT AN AMAZON FACILITY YU KNOW ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND THAT'S JUST SOMETHING YOU DON'T SEE VERY OFTEN
POD1000000034_S0000029	SO CLEARLY YOU KNOW WORKERS WHO FEEL UNDER EXTREME ONTSON PRESSURE THEMSELVES THINK THAT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO OUNOW MAYBE ASK THINGS OF MANAGEMENT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE DIFFICULT UNDER SORT OF BUSINESS AS USUAL CONDITIONS
POD1000000034_S0000030	BLOOMBERG'S MATT DAY AMAZON ALSO SAYS IT'S NO LONGER GOING TO SELL N NINETY FIVE MASKS AND OTHER URGENTLY NEEDED COVD NINETEEN RELATED SUPPLIES TO REGULAR CUSTOMERS
POD1000000034_S0000031	THE COMPANY HAS A NEW SECTION OF ITS WEBSITE JUST FOR THESE PRODUCTS AND SAYS IT WILL PRIORITIZE THEM FOR HOSPITALS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES
POD1000000034_S0000033	AND NOW FOR SOME RELATED LINKS MATT DAY RECENTLY WROTE ABOUT AMAZON'S SURGE IN HIRING TO MEET ALL THE DEMAND FROM PEOPLE STUCK AT HOME DUE TO CORONAVIRUS
POD1000000034_S0000034	AND SOME OF THAT HIRING LAST MONTH WAS HAPPENING AT JOB FAIRS WHERE PEOPLE WEREN'T EXACTLY ABLE TO PRACTICE SOCIAL DISTANCING
POD1000000034_S0000035	AMAZON SAID IT'S SINCE UPDATED ITS RECRUITING STRATEGIES TO ACCORDING TO MATT'S REPORTS KEEP APPLICANTS SAFE
POD1000000034_S0000037	AND MY COLLEAGUE ANDY ULER COVERED THOSE AMAZON PROTESTS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT
POD1000000034_S0000038	AND SPEAKING OF SAFETY INSTACART SAYS IT'S GOING TO START PROVIDING FULL SERVICE SHOPPERS WITH A SAFETY KIT INCLUDING A MASK HAND SANITIZER AND A THERMOMETER
POD1000000034_S0000039	SHOPPERS HAVE TO REQUEST THE KITS BUT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FREE YOU CAN FIND THE LINKS TO ALL THESE STORIES AT MARKETPLACE DOT ORG
POD1000000034_S0000041	AND HERE'S WHAT ELSE WE'RE WATCHING AFTER YEARS OF NEGOTIATIONS A BUNCH OF LAWSUITS A DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE INVESTIGATION MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN LOBBYING AND SOME EXTRA STAYS AT THE TRUMP HOTEL
POD1000000034_S0000042	THE MERGER BETWEEN T MOBILE AND SPRINT IS FINALLY DONE THAT DEAL IS WORTH ABOUT TWENTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS AND LEAVES US WITH JUST THREE BIG WIRELESS NETWORKS ATANT VORIZON AND T MOBILE AND NO ONE ELSE

POD1000000034_S0000045	THIS IS A PM
POD1000000035_S0000001	HUGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE SIGNING UP FOR UNEMPLOYMENT ARE EXPOSING AN INFRASTRUCTURE PROBLEM IN STATES
POD1000000035_S0000002	REALLY REALLY OLD TECHNOLOGY
POD1000000035_S0000003	FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA THIS IS MARKETPLACE TECH DEMYSTIFYING THE DIGITAL ECONOMY I'M OLLY WOOD
POD1000000035_S0000005	NEW JERSEY'S GOVERNOR RECENTLY WENT ON T ASKING FOR VOLUNTEERS WHO KNOW COBAL A MORE THAN SIXTY YEAR OLD COMPUTER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
POD1000000035_S0000006	THAT'S BECAUSE THE STATE'S UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT SYSTEM RUNS ON A DECADE'S OLD MAINFRAME THAT CAN'T KEEP UP WITH THE VOLUME OF REQUESTS FOR FINANCIAL HELP
POD1000000035_S0000007	AND NEW JERSEY ISN'T ALONE SEVERAL STATES NOT TO MENTION LOTS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE ALL AT THE MERCY OF THESE VERY OLD SYSTEMS RUNNING ON A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE THAT ISN'T EVEN TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS ANYMORE
POD1000000035_S0000008	JOSEPH STEINBERG IS A CYBER SECURITY CONSULTANT AND AUTHOR OF THE BOOK CYBER SECURITYES FOR DUMMIES
POD1000000035_S0000009	WELL FIRST OF ALL THERE ARE MANY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT USE MAINFRAMES WITH COBALL FOR BACKEND PROCESSING OF TRANSACTIONS AND BATCH PROCESSING
POD1000000035_S0000010	I THINK THEY' PROBABLY HAVE THINGS IN A LOT BETTER SHAPE BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES INHOUSE
POD1000000035_S0000011	IN SOME CASES THEY'VE REPLACED THE SYSTEMS AT GREAT EXPENSE OVER RECENT YEARS IN SOME CASES THEY'RE DOING IT NOW
POD1000000035_S0000012	AND IN SOME CASES THEY'VE MADE THE DECISIONS TO ACTUALLY TRAIN PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THESE SYSTEMS GOING FORWARD
POD1000000035_S0000013	BUT WHEN IT COMES TO GOVERNMENT AND I WOULD SAY PROBABLY EVEN WORSE IN THE STATE GOVERNMENTS THAN IN THE FEDERAL
POD1000000035_S0000014	YOU HAVE MANY SYSTEMS THAT SEEM TO HANG AROUND FOR A VERY LONG TIME
POD1000000035_S0000015	ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I POSED IN THE LAST WEEK IS SIMPLY IF GOD FORBID THIS PANDEMIC CONTINUED FOR SEVERAL MORE MONTHS AND ALL AMERICANS HAD TO VOTE IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION REMOTELY
POD1000000035_S0000016	
POD1000000035_S0000017	DO ALL FIFTY STATES ACTUALLY HAVE COMPUTER SYSTEMS THAT COULD ACCOMMODATE THAT VOLUME OF BALLOTS GOING OUT AND IN TO BE COUNTED PROCESSED IN A SECURE FASHION IN YOU KNOW IN ANY REASONABLE TIMEFRAME
POD1000000035_S0000018	AND I'M AFRAID OF WHAT THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION MIGHT BE WE SIMPLY HAVE A LOT OF LEGACY SYSTEMS INVOLVED IN VARIOUS STATE PROCESSES AND THEY ARE NOT MEANT THEY WERE NEVER DESIGNED TO ACCOMMODATE YOU KNOW MASS LOADS THAT COULD SUDDENLY HAPPEN NOW
POD1000000035_S0000019	
POD1000000035_S0000020	AND IT'S A LOT HARDER TO SCALE THESE LEGACY SYSTEMS YOU KNOW
POD1000000035_S0000021	NEWER TECHNOLOGIES SCALE MUCH BETTER AND I'M AFRAID OF WHAT'S OUT THERE YOU KNOW AT THE STATE LEVEL
POD1000000035_S0000022	AND I'M SURE THERE'S SOME IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT YOU KNOW THESE ARE AFTER THIS PANDEMIC IS OVER IT'S REALLY GOINGNA BE TIME TO TAKE A SERIOUS LOOK AT A LOT OF THESE OLDER SYSTEMS AND EVALUATE WHETHER THEY REALLY ARE RELIABLE ONLY BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T HAD TO MAKE CHANGES OR THEY'RE REALLY RELIABLE
POD1000000035_S0000023	THINK IN MANY CASES WE'LL FIND IT'S THE FORMER
POD1000000035_S0000024	RIGHT I MEAN IT SEEMS LIKE THIS IS SORT OF AN INVISIBLE INFRASTRUCTURE PROBLEM IN AMERICA THAT IN SOME WAYS IS AS EXPENSIVE AND DIFFICULT TO FIX AS ROADS AND BRIDGES
POD1000000035_S0000025	IT'S AS EXPENSIVE AND PERHAPS IN SOME WAYS MORE DANGEROUS BECAUSE YOU DON'T NOTICE IT UNTIL THE PROBLEM HAPPENS
POD1000000035_S0000026	RIGHT YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO DESPERATELY NEED MONEY BECAUSE THEIR WORK SUDDENLY ENDED THEY PLACE AN UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIM AND THEY CAN'T GET IT PROCESSED
POD1000000035_S0000027	THAT CAN BE DANGEROUS PEOPLE COULD BE LOW ON FOOD AND OTHER SUPPLIES AND IT'S NOT LIKE THEY CAN EASILY OBTAIN THEM NOW EITHER
POD1000000035_S0000028	AND I THINK THAT'S PRECISELY THE ISSUE WITH THESE OLDER SYSTEMS
POD1000000035_S0000029	OFTEN WE ASSUME THAT THEY'RE RELIABLE UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE AND THE PROBLEM YOU KNOW HAS HIT AND AT THAT POINT YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT A TACTICAL PROBLEM HOW DO WE PROCESS THESE UUNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS
POD1000000035_S0000030	AND A STRATEGIC PROBLEM HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THIS NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN IN THE FUTURE
POD1000000035_S0000031	YOU'RE SAYING THAT EVEN IF WE WERE ABLE TO BRING A LOT OF PROGRAMMERS OUT OF RETIREMENT THAT THESE SYSTEMS SIMPLY MAY NOT EVER BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE LOAD THAT IS BEING PUT ON THEM NOW
POD1000000035_S0000032	IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO SCALE THEM UP WITH IMPROVED HARDWARE BUT THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY EXPENSIVE NUMBER ONE
POD1000000035_S0000033	AND THEY DON'T SCALE AS SIMPLY AS MORE MODERN SYSTEMS DO SO YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT YOU'RE HIRING PROGRAMMERS OUT OF RETIREMENT AND PEOPLE DON'T LIVE FOREVER
POD1000000035_S0000034	YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE AN ENDLESS SUPPLY OF PROGRAMMERS WHO PROGRAMMED IN THE SEVENTYS IN THE WORKFORCE
POD1000000035_S0000035	AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT THESE SYSTEMS AREN'T RELIABLE THEY MAY BE VERY RELIABLE FOR WHAT THEY DO NOW
POD1000000035_S0000036	
POD1000000035_S0000037	BUTWE HAVE TO ACCEPT THE FACT THAT SYSTEMS MAY NEED TO BE CHANGED AND MAY NEED TO SCALE UP SUDDENLY AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DO IT WITH THE EXISTING TECHNOLOGY AND HUMAN RESOURCES
POD1000000035_S0000038	I MEAN I HAVE BEEN AT COMPANIES THAT REPLATFORMED AND IT IS HARD AND IT'S REALLY EXPENSIVE AND WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE AT A SORT OF STATE AND NATIONAL LEVEL WHAT KIND OF INVESTMENT IN TERMS OF BOTH TECHNOLOGY AND MONEY WOULD THAT TAKE
POD1000000035_S0000039	THE THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS THERE'S ALSO A POLITICAL PROBLEM WITH THINGS LIKE THIS
POD1000000035_S0000040	YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE A STATE ELECTED OFFICIAL AND YOU HAVE TO BUDGET A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR REPLACING A SYSTEM NO USER OF THAT SYSTEM INITIALLY BENEFITS FROM IT
POD1000000035_S0000041	SO YOU NEED TO HAVE THE POLITICAL WILL WHICH I THINK AFTER THIS WE WILL TO INVEST THE MONEY BEFORE PROBLEMS HAPPEN UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU'RE INVESTING FOR THE FUTURE
POD1000000035_S0000042	WE SHOULD HAVE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE SET UP THAT IF THERE IS AN EMERGENCY IN WHICH PEOPLE ARE DYING THE GOVERNOR SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON PEOPLE NOT ON YOU KNOW TECHNICAL GLITCHES IN AN UNEMPLOYMENT SYSTEM
POD1000000035_S0000043	RIGHT THIS IS SPECULATIVE AND A VAGUELY NIGHTMARE SCENARIO BUT AT WHAT POINT DO YOU THINK COMPANIES
POD1000000035_S0000045	LIKE AN AMAZON OR MICROSOFT OR A GOOGLE MIGHT APPROACH STATES AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND SAY MAYBE YOU NEED A PRIVATE SOLUTION A PRIVATIZED INFRASTRUCTURE FOR SOME OF THIS
POD1000000035_S0000047	I DON'T KNOW IF THEY ALREADY HAVE THEY MAY HAVE APPROACHED THEM YEARS AGO AND BEEN TOLD THAT THE SYSTEM IS WORKING WE HAVE NO NEED TO REPLACE IT I DON'T KNOW
POD1000000035_S0000048	BUT YOU KNOW I'M SURE THAT AFTER THIS IS ALL OVER AS THE GOVERNOR HIMSELF SAID WE'RE GOIN TO HAVE A POST MORTEM
POD1000000035_S0000049	AND THEN AFTER THAT POST MORTUM THERE'S GOING TO BE EVALUATIONS OF MANY DIFFERENT OPTIONS AS TO HOW TO PROCEED AND SOME OF THOSE WILL INVOLVE UTILIZING THIRD PARTY RESOURCES POTENTIALLY
POD1000000035_S0000050	BY THE WAY YOU COULD HAVE A CLOUD THAT'S RUN BY THE GOVERNMENT IT COULD BE A PRIVATE CLOUD SYSTEM IT COULD BE THEIR OWN INFRASTRUCTURE
POD1000000035_S0000051	YOU KNOW THERE ARE MANY MANY OPTIONS BUT MOVING AWAY FROM THE COBAL CODE RUNNING ON THE MAINFRAME TO A MORE MODERN PLATFORM MIGHT ALLOW FOR GREATER YOU KNOW SCALABILITY SUDDENLY IF NEEDED AS WELL AS FOR EASIER MAINTENANCE IF YOU KNOW CODE CHANGES NEED TO BE MADE
POD1000000035_S0000052	YOU KNOW YOU'RE CERTAINLY NOT GOING TAO NEED TO GO BEGGING FOR PROGRAMMERS AT A PRESS CONFERENCE
POD1000000035_S0000054	JOSEPH STEINBERG IS A CYBER SECURITY CONSULTANT
POD1000000035_S0000056	AND NOW FOR SOME RELATED LINKS WE'VE GOT A LINK TO THAT TWENTY SIXTEEN REPORT FROM THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE WHICH FOUND THAT AMONG OTHER THINGS THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE USES EIGHT INCH FLOPPY DISCS TO COORDINATE SOME OF THE COUNTRY'S NUCLEAR FORCES
POD1000000035_S0000057	YOU CAN SEE WHY THEY WANT TO GET THAT BIG CLOUD PROJECT MOVING I GUESS
POD1000000035_S0000058	IN OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE NEWS MIT TECHNOLOGY REVIEW HAS A PIECE THIS WEEK ABOUT HOW GENERALLY SPEAKING THE INTERNET IS HOLDING UP SHOCKINGLY WELL IN THE MIDST OF OUR BIG TRANSITION FROM WORK AND SCHOOL TO HOME
POD1000000035_S0000059	IT POINTS OUT THAT CLOUD SERVICE PROVIDERS AND ALSO STREAMING MEDIA AND TELECOM COMPANIES
POD1000000035_S0000060	SO THINK AMAZON OR COMCAST NETFLIX MICROSOFT GOOGLE THEY ALL PUT A LOT OF MONEY INTO NEW INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE PAST DECADE OR SO IN ORDER TO KEEP DELIVERING THEIR SERVICES
POD1000000035_S0000061	AND NOW THIS CURRENT CRISIS IS GENERATING EVEN MORE INVESTMENT
POD1000000035_S0000062	NOW IF ONLY WE COULD DO THE SAME FOR THE POWER GRID AND THE BRIDGES AND THE STATE AND COUNTY MAINFRAMES
POD1000000035_S0000064	AND HERE'S WHAT ELSE WE'RE WATCHING IN TECH A BRUTAL WEEK AT YELP
POD1000000035_S0000065	THE COMPANY THAT IS BASICALLY BUILT ON SMALL BUSINESSES IS LAYING OFF A THOUSAND PEOPLE AND FURLOUHING ANOTHER ELEVEN HUNDRED ACCORDING TO AXIOS
POD1000000035_S0000066	YELPS CEO WILL TAKE NO SALARY FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR AND THE COMPANY IS CUTTING EXECUTIVE PAY BY TWENTY TO THIRTY PERCENT
POD1000000035_S0000068	ALSO ON THURSDAY MICROSOFT RELEASED A REPORT ABOUT REMOTE WORK TRENDS BASED ON DATA FROM ITS TEAM'S PRODUCT
POD1000000035_S0000069	THE COMPANY OF COURSE REPORTED A HUGE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE USING TEAMS
POD1000000035_S0000070	BUT THE REPORT HAS SOME SUPER INTERESTING DATA
POD1000000035_S0000071	FOR EXAMPLE IT NOTES THAT PEOPLE ARE USING VIDEO OBVIOUSLY IND THEIR MEETINGS A LOT MORE THAN THEY EVER DID BEFORE
POD1000000035_S0000072	A THOUSAND PERCENT MORE IN MARCH IN FACT
POD1000000035_S0000073	BUT THE US LAGS A LITTLE BIT IN TERMS OF VIDEO CALLING
POD1000000035_S0000074	IN NORWAY AND THE NETHERLANDS ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT OF CALLS INCLUDE VIDEO BUT ONLY THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT OF AMERICAN MEETINGS HAVE THE CAMERA TURNED ON
POD1000000035_S0000075	I MEAN LISTEN I'M JUST GOINTA CONFESS THAT I STRAIGHT UP REFUSED TO JOIN A MEETING BY VIDEO ON THURSDAY BECAUSE I FOR ONE CAN NO LONGER STAND THE SIGHT OF MY OWN FOREHEAD
POD1000000035_S0000076	I SEE YOU AMERICA OR RATHER I ONLY HEAR YOU
POD1000000035_S0000077	STEPHANE HOES PRODUCES MARKETPLACE TECH HEY SUS ALVORADO IS OUR ASSISTANT PRODUCER JODY BECKER IS OUR SENIOR EDITOR ROBIN EDGAR IS OUR ENGINEER I'M MOLLY WOOD AND THAT'S MARKETPLACE TECH HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND
POD1000000035_S0000078	THIS IS A PM
POD1000000036_S0000001	FACEBOOK USERS IN ILLINOIS COULD EACH BE IN LINE FOR A COUPLE OF HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR PRIVACY VIOLATIONS WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR THE REST OF US
POD1000000036_S0000002	FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA THIS IS MARKETPLACE TECH DEMYSTIFYING THE DIGITAL ECONOMY I'M JACK STEWART INFORMOLLY WOOD
POD1000000036_S0000004	ABOUT A DECADE AGO FACEBOOK STARTED AUTOMATICALLY TAGGING PEOPLE WHOSE FACES ITS ALGORITHMS HAD RECOGNISED IN OUR UPLOADED PHOTOS AT THE TIME IT SEEMED LIKE MAGIC
POD1000000036_S0000005	BUT THIS WEEK FACEBOOK HAS AGREED TO PAY FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OVER CLAIMS THAT TOOL VIOLATED PRIVACY RIGHTS THE SETTLEMENT IS IN ILLINOIS WHICH HAS STRICT LAWS PROTECTING BIOMETRIC DATA
POD1000000036_S0000006	FACEBOOK REVEALED THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AT THE SAME TIME AS ITS QUARTERLY FINANCIAL RESULTS THIS WEEK AND THEY BY THE WAY SHOWED THAT REVENUE WAS UP TWENTY FIVE PERCENT TO TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS AT THE END OF LAST YEAR
POD1000000036_S0000007	FOR TODAY'S QUALITY ASSURANCE WE HAVE NATASHA SINGA TECH REPORTER FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES TO EXPLAIN WHAT THIS SETTLEMENT MEANS
POD1000000036_S0000008	SO ILLINOIS HAS THE TOUGHEST BIOMETRIC PRIVACY LAW IN THE UNITED STATES THERE ARE ONLY THREE STATES THAT HAVE THESE KIND OF LAWS
POD1000000036_S0000009	AND SO BIOMETRIC PRIVACY PERTAINS TO YOUR FINGERPRINTS OR FACIAL SCANS FOR FACIAL RECOGNITION AND SO IN ILLINOIS THE LAW SAYS THAT COMPANIES CAN'T COLLECT THAT KIND OF INFORMATION LIKE FACIAL DATA FOR FACIAL RECOGNITION WITHOUT GETTING WRITTEN PERMISSION FROM SOMEONE
POD1000000036_S0000010	AND ALSO THEY CAN'T COLLECT THE DATA WITHOUT TELLING SOMEBODY HOW LONG THEY'RE GOIN TO KEEP IT AND SO FACEBOOK USERS IN ILLINOIS SUED FACEBOOK SAYING THAT IT HAD COLLECTED THEIR FACIAL INFORMATION AND HAD NOT OBTAINED THEIR KIND OF AFFIRMATIVE OPTIN PERMISSION AND HAD NOT TOLD THEM HOW LONG THAT FACEBOOK WAS GOING TO KEEP IT
POD1000000036_S0000011	FACEBOOK SAYS THAT THESE CLAIMS ARE NOT TRUE BUT FACEBOOK SAID THAT IT SETTLED THIS LAWSUIT BECAUSE IT WAS GOING TO YOU KNOW DRAG ON AND TAKE UP TOO MUCH RESOURCES AND IT WAS BETTER FOR EVERYBODY AND THE STOCKHOLDERS IF THEY SETTLED THE LAWSUIT
POD1000000036_S0000012	DO YOU THINK THE SIZE OF THIS FACEBOOK SETTLEMENT MIGHT SERVE AS A WARNING TO OTHER COMPANIES WHO ARE CONSIDERING THIS SORT OF TECHNOLOGY
POD1000000036_S0000013	IT FEELS LIKE MAYBE WHEN FACEBOOK INTRODUCED THINGS LIKE FACIAL RECOGNITION THEY WERE JUST LOKING AT FUN WAYS OF USING IT AND MAYBE SOME OF THE OTHER IMPLICATIONS ARE NOW COMING TO LIGHT
POD1000000036_S0000014	IF YOU THINK ABOUT A FACE PRINT RIGHT IT'S LIKE THE FACIAL EQUIVALENT OF YOUR FINGERPRINT AND YOU MIGHT WANT TO USE YOUR FINGERPRINT FOR FUN WAYS
POD1000000036_S0000015	BUT WE KIND OF VISSERALLY KNOW THAT YOUR FINGERPRINT HAS ALL KINDS OF IMPLICATIONS AND IT'S UNIQUE SO EVEN THE NOTION OF FACEBOOK TURNING ON FACIAL RECOGNITION BY DEFAULT FOR FUN THINGS IS PROBLEMATIC FIRST OF ALL IN ILLINOIS
POD1000000036_S0000016	UT ALSO TO A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERNED THAT THE PROBLEM WITH FACIAL RECOGNITION IS THAT IT CAN BE USED TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE AT A DISTANCE
POD1000000036_S0000017	AND SO IT IMPLICATES YOUR ABILITY TO BE ANONYMOUS BOTH ONLINE AND IN PUBLIC
POD1000000036_S0000018	DO YOU THIN THERE'S A CHANCE WE'LL SEE COMPANIES BASICALLY DEFAULTING TO JUST NOT COLLECTING ANY DATA LIKE THIS AT THE RISK OF IT SOMEHOW BEING REGULATED IN THE FUTURE
POD1000000036_S0000019	CERTAINLY I THINK COMPANIES THAT ARE HAVING SIMILAR TECHNOLOGY AND THEY HAVE ILLINOIS USERS MUST BE THINKING ABOUT IT RIGHT BCAUSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT LIKE DOORBELL CAMS WHICH ARE SPREADING EVERYWHERE
POD1000000036_S0000020	WELL YOUR DOORBELL CAMERA IS GOING TO TAKE IMAGES OF PEOPLE AND IT'S USED FOR FACIAL RECOGNITION RIGHT SO THAT LIKE IT CAN RECOGNIZE YOUR BABY SITTER SO THAT THEY CAN COME IN IN ILLINOIS YOU NEED CONSENT FOR STUFF LIKE THAT
POD1000000036_S0000021	AND SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR ALL KINDS OF DVICES THAT COLLECT AMBIENT BIOMETRIC DATA I THINK WE DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER TO THAT I THINK THAT COMPANIES NOW BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE FACEBOOK SETTLEMENT ARE GOING TO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THEIR ILLINOIS PLAN IS
POD1000000036_S0000022	I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT THEY WANT TO HAVE ONE SET OF SOFTWARE FOR ILLINOIS AND ANOTHER FOR THE REST OF THE COUNTRY FIRST OF ALL YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST FROM A BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE INEFFICIENT
POD1000000036_S0000023	BUT SECOND OF ALL YOU KNOW YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY SAYING WELL YOU TURNED THAT OFF FOR ILLINOIS WHY HAVEN'T YOU TURNED IT OFF FOR US
POD1000000036_S0000024	AND SO WE'RE SEEING FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE CALIFORNIA PRIVACY LAW THAT A NUMBER OF COMPANIES MICROSOFT APPLE HAVE SAID WE'RE GOING TO HONOR THE RIGHTS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA PRIVACY LAW FOR EVERYBODY IN THE UNITED STATES
POD1000000036_S0000025	IT FEELS LIKE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THESE PRIVACY STORIES WE WE TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW THE VALUE OF YOUR PRIVACY OR THE VALUE OF YOUR DATA AND IT'S ALWAYS VERY HARD TO PUT A NUMBER ON HAT
POD1000000036_S0000026	YOU THINK THINGS LIKE THIS ILLINOIS SETTLEMENT ARE STARTING TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION AND PUTTING A DOLLAR VALUE ON THESE THINGS
POD1000000036_S0000027	SO I THINK THE NOTION THAT THERE'S A TRADE AND YOU'RE TRADING YOUR DATA FOR YOU KNOW SERVICES AND SO YOU'RE GIVING UP SOME OF YOUR PRIVACY IS THE SILICON VALLEY FRAMING THAT YOU'RE GETTING VALUE FOR DATA
POD1000000036_S0000028	BUT WHEN WE THINK OF A TRADE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GIVING UP AND WHAT YOU'RE GETTING BUT WHEN YOU GIVE UP YOUR DATA YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW IT'S GOING TO BE USED
POD1000000036_S0000029	IT CAN BE USED PERENNIALLY FOR ALL TIME FOR ALL KINDS OF PURPOSES FOR WHICH YOU DIDN'T GIVE IT AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT IT'S NOT A TRADE IT'S NOT A FAIR TRADE AND I WOULD ALSO ARGUE THAT UDATA IS NOT PROPERTY
POD1000000036_S0000030	IN EUROPE SECURITY AND PRIVACY ARE FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS AND IF WE THINK OF OTHER FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS LIKE THE RIGHT OF FREE SPEECH YOU WOULDN'T SAY I'M TRADING MY FREE SPEECH FOR FACEBOOK SERVICES
POD1000000036_S0000031	SO THIS NOTION THAT WE'RE TRADING OUR RIGHT TO PRIVACY FOR SERVICES I THINK IS JUST A PROBLEMATIC FRAMING
POD1000000036_S0000033	OR THE NEW YORK TIMES ACCORDING TO THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE A FEDERAL COURT JUDGE MUST APPROVE THE FACEBOOK SETTLEMENT
POD1000000036_S0000034	AND THEN MEMBERS OF THE CLASS ACTION
POD1000000036_S0000036	CLAIMS FOR PART OF THE MONEY
POD1000000036_S0000038	RSOME RELATED LINKS TODAY CHECK OUT NATASHA'S STORY AT THE NEW YORK TIMES FOR MORE DETAIL ON THE SETTLEMENT AND NEXT STEPS AS WELL AS COVERAGE FROM THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE FOR MORE ON WHY ILLINOIS HAS BECOME SO IMPORTANT FOR PRIVACY LAWSUITS

POD1000000037_S0000008	THE DEMAND HAS GROWN AS KIDS WANT TO EMULATE THE ONLINE STARS THEY WATCH
POD1000000037_S0000009	JULIE JARGAN IS THE FAMILY AND TECH COLUMNIST AT THE WALL STREET JOURNAL AND SHE WROTE ABOUT THE TREND
POD1000000037_S0000010	SHE SAID KIDS LEARN HOW TO LIGHT SHOOT AND EDIT VIDEOS ALSO HOW TO DEVELOP THEIR PERSONAL BRANDS
POD1000000037_S0000011	THEY'RE TEACHING THEM TO CREATE THEIR OWN UNIQUE VOICE SO THAT THEY CAN STAND OUT IN THE CROWD OF YOUTUBERS AND DEVELOP ORIGINAL CONTENT
POD1000000037_S0000012	BUT YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE KIDS I TALK TO THEY JUST WANT TO SHOOT VIDEOS OF THEMSELVES PLAYING FORTNIGHT
POD1000000037_S0000013	SO THERE'S A LOT OF THAT ALREADY BUT THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF KIDS ARE INTERESTED IN DOING THEY THEY WATCH THE YOUTUBERS PLAYING VIDEO GAMES AND THEN THEY WANT TO DO IT THEMSELVES

POD1000000037_S0000019	OU KNOW THERERE A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT KIDS BEING EXPOSED PUBLICLY AND BEING OPEN TO BULLYING AND PREDATORS AND ALL F THAT STUFF THAT WE WORRY ABOUT ON THE INTERNET
POD1000000037_S0000020	BUT A LOT OF THE PARENTS I SPOKE TO WHO ALSO SHARED THOSE CONCERNS YOU KNOW KIND OF WENT ABOUT IT THOUGHTFULLY AND SAID WELL MY KID WANTS TO DO SOMETHING THEY'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT IT HOW DO I FOSTER THAT
POD1000000037_S0000021	AND IS THERE A WAY TO LOOK AT YOUTUBE AS A MEDIUM THAT CAN BE AN OUTLET FOR THEIR CREATIVITY TO DEVELOP SKILLS THAT THEY MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO DEVELOP ON THEIR OWN AT HOME
POD1000000037_S0000022	AND ALSO HOW CAN THOSE SKILLS TRANSLATE TO OTHER LIFE EXPERIENCES
POD1000000037_S0000023	AND ALSO JUST LEARNING THE POISE AND THE COMPOSURE OF SPEAKING ON FILM AND ADDRESSING AN AUDIENCE
POD1000000037_S0000024	YOU KNOW THOSE ARE ALL GOOD THINGS FOR KIDS TO KNOW HOW TO DO
POD1000000037_S0000025	YEAH SUMMER IS HIS I GUESS IT'S LIKE A BLANK CANVAS FOR KIDS TO DO WHATEVER THEY WANT OR I GUESS WHAT THEIR PARENTS WANT THEM TO LEARN
POD1000000037_S0000026	AND ARE PARENTS MORE VALUING DEVELOPING DIGITAL SKILLS THAN THEY WERE IN THE PAST
POD1000000037_S0000027	I THINK SO I THINK THERE'S A GROWING AWARENESS OF THE FACT THAT THESE KIND OF SKILLS COULD BE USEFUL FOR FUTURE CAREERS I MEAN GAMING ALONE IS SUCH A HUGE INDUSTRY
POD1000000037_S0000028	A LOT OF KIDS GO TO CODING CAMPS TO LEARN HOW TO CODE VIDEO GAMES
POD1000000037_S0000029	SO THERE ARE A LOT OF DIGITAL SORT OF SKILLS THAT YOU KNOW OLDER GENERATION OF PARENTS DON'T HAVE AND THEY'RE SEEING THAT IT COULD BE APPLICABLE TO FUTURE CAREER CHOICES FOR THEIR CHILDREN
POD1000000037_S0000030	SOME PARENTS ARE YOU KNOW THEY'RE INCREASINGLY CONCERNED ABOUT SCREEN TIME AND LIKE SOCIAL MEDIA AND SPENDING ALL DAY VIDEO GAMING LIKE EVEN IF IT IS FOR LEARNING
POD1000000037_S0000031	SO WHAT MAKES A FAMILY MORE WARY OF TECH COMPARED TO OTHER FAMILIES THAT ARE LIKE GO FOR IT
POD1000000037_S0000032	YO KNO I JUST THINK IT COMES DOWN TO AN INDIVIDUAL CHOICE AND AND INDIVIDUAL FEELINGS ABOUT TECHNOLOGY SOME FAMILIES JUST REALLY EMBRACE IT AND THEY DON'T WANT THER KIDS TO BE BEHIND
POD1000000037_S0000033	UMAND THEY FEEL LIKE IF THEIR KIDS AREN'T LEARNING THESE SKILLS OR AWARE OF WHAT'S GOING ON ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE INTERNET MORE BROADLY THAT THEY WILL SOMEHOW BE SOCIAL OUTCASTS OR THEY WON'T HAVE THE SKILLS TO BE COMPETITIVE IN YOU KNOW IN THE FUTURE WORKFORCE
POD1000000037_S0000034	OTHER PARENTS ARE JUST REALLY CAUTIOUS I MEAN IT'S NOT WHAT WE GREW UP WITH
POD1000000037_S0000035	AND SO THEY'RE YOU KNOW YOU HEAR THE HORROR STORIES AND YOU HEAR ABOUT ONLINE BULLYING AND YOUTUBE IS A VERY PUBLIC FORUM AND PEOPLE CAN LEAVE YOU KNOW MEAN COMMENTS
POD1000000037_S0000036	AND YOU KNOW IS A CHILD REALLY READY TO DEAL WITH THAT YOU KNOW ARE THEY DEVELOPMENTALLY READY AND EMOTIONALLY READY TO LET IT ROLL OFF THEIR SKIN WHEN SOMEONE POSTS A A MEAN COMMENT ABOUT THEIR VIDEO
POD1000000037_S0000037	THAT'S A DIFFICULT THING FOR ADULTS TO EVEN FACE THAT KIND OF CRITICISM FROM THE TROLLS AND SO PARENTS HAVE TO REALLY PREPARE THEIR KIDS FOR THAT
POD1000000037_S0000038	I MEAN THERE ARE THINGS YOU CAN DO YOU CAN MODERATE THE COMMENTS THAT ARE POSTED ON YOUTUBE YOU CAN TURN THEM OFF YOU CAN MAKE A YOUTUBE CHANNEL PRIVATE SO NO ONE CAN SEE IT
POD1000000037_S0000039	THAT SORT OF DEFEATS THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF POSTING ON YOUTUBE THOUGH BECAUSE IT'S MEANT TO BE SHARED AND YOUTUBE VIDEOS ARE MEANT TO BE COMMENTED ON SO

POD1000000041_S0000240	IN THE WAY THAT BASICALLY ALL OF THE IDEAS FOR POLICE REFORM THAT ARE ENDORSED BY THE POLICE ARE TEND TO BE BUT YEAH THIS ONE
POD1000000041_S0000241	IS BASICALLY SAYING THAT BECOMING A COP SHOULD REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE
POD1000000041_S0000242	AND BE TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD JUST BASED ON STATISTICS ABOUT WHAT POLICE OFFICERS WITH THOSE ATTRIBUTES HOW VIOLENT THEY ARE VERSUS OTHERWISE
POD1000000041_S0000243	YEAH THE LEGISLATOR WHO'S PUTTING IT WHO'S WHO WROTE THE BILL IS REFERRING TO LIKE THIS STUDY IN TWENTY TEN THAT THAT BASICALLY SAYS THAT COLLEGE EDUCATED OFFICERS TYPICALLY TYPICALLY

POD1000000041_S0000246	NOW OKY THAT'S GOOD THING TO IDENTIFY THAT GROUP OF PEOPLE BUT THIS IS YOU KNOW LIKE WE'RE SAYING THIS IS INCREMENTAL CHANGE WHEN WE KNOW WHAT THE REAL ISSUES ARE
POD1000000041_S0000247	BUT YOU KNOW THIS ISN'T THE ISSUE HERE AND LIKE THE REASON THIS BILL IS COMING OUT ISN'T BECAUSE WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH YOU KNOW NOT ENOUGH COPS WHO' STUDIED ABROAD IN BARTAELONA
POD1000000041_S0000249	WE HAVE FUCKING REAL ISSUES HERE THIS IS AN ISSUE WITHIN POLICING THAT IS ANTI BLACK ANTI POOR ANTI FUCKING EVERYTHING AND THEY 'ARE PROTECTED BY POWERFUL UNIONS
POD1000000041_S0000250	THAT CAN KEEP ANY KIND OF REAL MEANINGFUL LIKE LEGAL REPERCUSSIONS FROM EVER YOU KNOW GETTING CLOSE TO THEM AS WELL AS LIKE THE FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCES

POD1000000041_S0000255	AND WE JUST NEED TO LOOK AT HOW MUCH MONEY IS GOING TO THESE DEPARTMENTS AND ACTUALLY JUST HAVING THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT REINVESTING IN COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THE PERCEPTION IN LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THIS COUNTRY IS
POD1000000041_S0000256	WELL PEOPLE COMMIT CRIME BECAUSE THEY'RE BLACK RIGHT RATHER THAN SEEING THE FULL PICTURE OF HOW BLACK AND BROWN AMERICANS HAVE BEEN ABANDONED AND WE'RE MERELY JUST BRANDING THIS FAILURE OF GOVERNANCE AS CRIME

POD1000000042_S0000087	IT'S DIFFERENT HERE'S THE THING MAN IT'S ANYBODY CAN BE ANYBODY IN TODAY'S SOCIETY CAN BE FAMOUS OVERNIGHT
POD1000000042_S0000088	IF THEY GET THE RIGHT AVENUE RIGHT LIKE DAVID GOGGINS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE GOING ON ROGAN MAN I DIDN'T KNOW WHO THAT WAS
POD1000000042_S0000089	UNTIL HE WENT ON JOE ROGAN JACO I WASN'T FAMILIAR WITH BECAUSE I'M I'M A NON MILITARY GUY RIGHT I'M A CIVILIAN U BUT HE GOES ON ROGAN AND CRUSHES AND YOU'RE LIKE A RIGHT GREAT IT DEPENDS ON THE OPPORTUNITIES AND WHERE YOU ARE
POD1000000042_S0000090	AND THEN YOU'RE MESSAGING AFTER IT ON TOP OF IT NOW CLEARLY WHAT YOU'RE WRITING ABOUT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR TODAY'S WORLD AND HELPING GETTING JOBS WHEN YOU COME OUT
POD1000000042_S0000091	AND MAYBE THIS SHOW WILL BE THE PLATFORM FOR YOU FOR YOU AS A PERSON WHY WAS THIS SO IMPORTANT TO WRITE
POD1000000042_S0000093	YOU KNOW I FUNDAMENTALLY THE STRONGEST FORCE IN THIS NATION IS OUR ECONOMY AND PEOPLE DON'T TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY YOU KNOW IT IS OUR DUTY AS AMERICAN CITIZENS TO MAKE SURE THAT THING IS AS STRONG AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE WHEN IT IS WE HAVE EVERYTHING WE NEED IN THE MILITARY
POD1000000042_S0000094	AND FOR A VET COMING OUT IF YOU CAN'T FIND PURPOSE YOU KNOW L SO MANY VETTS NOWADAYS SAY HEY YOU KNOW I YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW MY WY I DON'T KNOW MY PURPOSE YEAH YOU'VE GOT ONE PURPOSE GET A JOB MAKE THE ECONOMY STRONGER
POD1000000042_S0000095	AND THAT'S YOUR DUTY TO THE NEXT GENERATION OF MILITARYLEADERS COMING IN
POD1000000042_S0000097	AND WHY DO YO THINK IT'S SO HARD TO GET THROUGH PEOPLE'S HEADS OF WHY THEY SHOULD HIRE MILITARY VETERANS LIKE THIS IS ONE THAT I WILL NEVER UNDER
POD1000000042_S0000098	THERE'S A LOT OF MISCONCEPTIONS OUT THERE MAN HONESTLY I MEAN IT'S IT'S HOW DO YOU TRANSLATE INTANGIBLE SKILLS INTO TANGIBLE SKILLS WHEN WE ALL KNOW FROM PEOPLE THAT HAVE DEVELOPED IF YOU'RE AN IF YOU'RE A SPORTS COACH OR A LEADER IN THE MILITARY
POD1000000042_S0000100	OU KNOW THAT SOMEONE'S RESUME IS FAR LESS IMPORTANT THAN THEIR ABILITY TO FUCKING CHANGE ON THE FLY RIGHT TO ABSORB INFORMATION MAKE QUICK DECISIONS AND THEN TURN THAT INFORMATION INTO GOOD DECISIONS
POD1000000042_S0000101	NWAT I MEAN THAT'S A T YOU CAN'T YOU CAN TEACH PEOPLE TO DO IT IT'S NOT TRUE THAT YOU CAN'T TEACH PEOPLE BUT PEOPLE THAT CAN DO IT UNDER EXTREME DRESS ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN AND THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE YOU WANT IN THOSE LIKE HIGH LEVEL POSITIONS
POD1000000042_S0000102	YES OR OR IN EVEN LOWER LEVEL POSITIONS LIKE I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT AS WELL LIKE I GOT MY FIRST TASTE OF IT ON RANGE FIFTEEN WHEN I DIRECTED THAT THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME WHERE MOST OF THE PEOPLE BEHIND THE CAMERA WERE VETERANS RIGHT
POD1000000042_S0000103	THEY DIDN'T HAVE AS MUCH EXPERIENCE AS AS TYPICAL PEOPLE IN HOLLYWOOD BUT THE WORK ETHIC THEY OUTWORKED ANY OF THOSE LAZY ASSHOLES LIKE THREE TO ONE AND AFTER THAT I MEAN MY MIND COMPLETELY CHANGED WHERE I WAS JUST LIKE DUDE
POD1000000042_S0000104	IF YOU'RE NOT HIRING MILITARY VETERANS TO DO ALL THE SHIT LIKE YOU'RE MISSING OUT ON I MEAN BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING YOU DON'T HAVE TO TEACH THEM YOU DON'T HAVETO TEACH THEM WORK WORTH ETHIC WHATSOEVER OR WHAT IT'S LIKE TO GET UP EARLY AND WORK HARD NO THISTUFF LIKE
POD1000000042_S0000105	THAT'S ALREADY INSTILLED IN EVERYBODY THAT COMES OUT OF THE MILITARY AS A CIVILIAN MY GOD MAN THAT'S THE FIRST FUCKING PEOPLE I WOULD HIRE OVER ANY OF THESE FUCKING ASSHOLES IT WAS LIKE
POD1000000042_S0000106	MY DAD DID THIS OR I GON IN THIS OR WHATEVER AND IT'S LIKE WELL WELL GREAT HOW WAS I GONNA HELP MY COMPANY YOU KNOW
POD1000000042_S0000107	SO THE BOOK IS NOT EXACTLY YOU KNOW AN ARGUMENT FOR WHY YOU SHOULD HIRE VETERANS RIGHT BUT AS A WHOLE IT SPEAKS TO YOU HIRE FOR CHARACTER YOU HIRE FOR ATTITUDE YOU HI HIRE FOR MINDSET
POD1000000042_S0000108	INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE WHICH IS HOW NINETY NINE PERCENT OF COMPANIES HIRE IS NOT A PREDICTOR OF SUCCESS IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE SOMEBODY HAS FIVE YEARS OF MARKETING YOU KNOW EXPERIENCE DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE GOOD AT MARKETING
POD1000000042_S0000109	IF YOU FIND SOMEBODY WITH ALL THE RIGHT ATTRIBUTES AND YOU TRAIN THEM LIKE YOU JUST SAID YEAH THEY WILL OUTWORK THEY WILL OUTPACE THOSE PEOPLE EVENTUALLY AND IT'S FRUSTRATING MYOU KNOW THE SYSTEMIC CHALLENGES WITH VETERANS YOU KNOW WHERE CIVILIANS GET THIS
POD1000000042_S0000110	BCAUSE LET'S BE HONEST YOU KNOW COMING OUT OF WORLD WAR TWO PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE SERVED IN THE MILITARY FOR THE MOST PART YEAH AND THEY HAD THEY UNDERS
POD1000000042_S0000111	I HAD TO
POD1000000042_S0000112	YEAH THEY UNDERSOOD THE VALUE OF VETERANS IT'S NOW THE ONE PERCENT VERSUS THE NINETY NINE PERCENT
POD1000000042_S0000113	WLL I MEAN IT'S IT'S POINT FOUR FIVE PERCENT ACTUALLY WAN TO BE SPECIFIC YEA I THINK IN I THINK IN WORLD WAR TWO WAS LIKE FIFTEEN POINT EIGHT PERCENT TO THE NOW POINT FOUR FIVE PERCENT YEAH
POD1000000042_S0000115	
POD1000000042_S0000116	SO IT'S A DIFFERENT WORLD NOW OBVIOUSLY
POD1000000042_S0000117	YTHE NINETY NINE POINT FIVE PERCENT THEIR PERCEPTIONS ARE BASED OFF WHAT THEY SEE IN THE MOVIES RGHT HOLLYWOOD IS ALWAYS GOING NO BE THE BEST RECRUITING TOOL FOR THE MILITARY IT'S ALSO ITS WORST ENEMY WHEN YOU GET OUT
POD1000000042_S0000118	THAT'S WHY SHOWS LIKE SEEL TEAM ARE SO IMPORTANT LIKE THEY GET IT ALL RIGHT THEY DON'T CHURCH UP ANY OF THE BULLSHIT AND IT'S SOME IT'S ONE THING TO BE TO CHALLENGE SOME OF THOSE ISSUES AND TAKE THEM ON AND A NETWORK ENVIRONMENT IS TOUGH WHEN YOU'RE MURDERING PEOPLE BASICALLY
POD1000000042_S0000119	BUT THEY GET A THEY GET A LOT RIGHT AND ALL THOSE GUYS ARE HUGE SUPPORTERS OF THE MILITARY AS WELL THAT'S WHY THEY GOT TO INTO THE PROGRAM IN THE FIRST PLACE TYLER LIKE IS A YOU KNOW TYLER
POD1000000042_S0000120	TELEGRAH
POD1000000042_S0000121	HE'S HE'S A FUCKING MAGYET HE'S E HE IS A MAGNET FOR GOOD AND TALENTED PEOPLE I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS ABOUT HIM THAT MAKES THAT HAPPEN MAYBE HE'S JESUS IT'S HARD TO SAY
POD1000000042_S0000123	IT SEEMS LIKE PEOPLE FIRST OF ALL HE'S ONE OF THE HARDEST WORKING HUMAN BEINGS I'VE EVER MET N MY LIFE BUT HE'S ALSO BRILLIANT AND AN OPERATOR SO IT'S
POD1000000042_S0000124	PEOPLE FLOCK TO HIM TO BE ABLE TO EXPRESS SHIT LIKE THAT AND I TALKED TO PEOPLE I'VE BEEN ON SET A COUPLE TIMES I TALKED TO THE PEOPLE THAT WORK ON THAT SHOW THAT'V BEEN IN HOLLYWOOD FOR YEARS AND THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT VETS THE SAME WAY THAT OTHER PEOPLE OUT THERE DO
POD1000000042_S0000125	THERE'S THERE'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT THE WAY THEY SPEAK AND YOU CAN TELL THAT IT'S JUST EXPERIENCE RIGHT
POD1000000042_S0000126	LIKE THAT'S ALL IT IS IT'S EXPERIENCE ONE ON ONE WITH HUMAN BEING IT'S THE REASON NOBODY HATES GAY PEOPLE ANYMORE EVERYBODY WAS AFRAID OF GAY PEOPLE FIFTEEN YEARS AGO AND TEYRE LIKE OH EVERYBODY'S GAY COOL YEH YAH NONE NO NE CARES NOW NO ONE CARES ANYMORE AND THERE'S SOME RETICENCE

POD1000000043_S0000062	THE FAILURE TO GIVE PEOPLE RESOURCES TO SURVIVE THE FAILURE TO HAVE ENOGH MASKS THE FAILURE TO MODEL BEST PRACTICES THE FAILURE TO MODEL GOOD BEHAVIOR THE FAILURE TO CELEBRATE THE PEOPLE THAT WERE DOING THE RIGHT THING THE FAILURE TO HELP THE PEOPLE THAT WERE DOING THE RIGHT THING
POD1000000043_S0000063	BECAUSE THERE WAS NO EASON THAT THIS VACCINE WOULD COME AT A TIME IN WHICH THE VIRUS WAS COMPLETELY UNCHECKED IN THIS COUNTRY AND THAT IS TRUMP'S GREAT FAILURE
POD1000000043_S0000064	AND IT IS A TRIBUTE TO EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO WAS INVOLVED IN MAKING THIS VACCINE HAPPEN THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO OVERCOME THE ABSENCE OF LEADERSHIP
POD1000000043_S0000065	THAT HAS BEEN BASICALLY THE ONLY CONSISTENT THING TRUMP HAS OFFERED UP AND UNTIL HIM PRETENDING TO BE A LEADER BY BADGERING OFFICIALS TO MAKE THE VACCINE ROLL OUT FASTER JUST BEFORE IT IS APPROVED
POD1000000043_S0000066	SO THAT HE COULD CLAIM SOME CREDIT AND GET HIMSELF IN THE NEW CYCLE IT ENDS S AS IT BEGAN
POD1000000043_S0000067	TLL ME WHAT DO YOU THINK DO YOU THINK WE'LL STILL REMEMBER THE BLEACH IN TWENTY
POD1000000043_S0000069	THE IDEA THAT ANY OF THESE PEOPLE CAN PREDICT WHAT WE WILL OR WON'T REMEMBER IN TWENTY EAI FEEL LIKE IN TWENTY YEARS OUR KIDS ARE GOINGNTO BE LIKE SO WAIT YOU GUYS COULD HAVE PUT CLENX ON YOUR FACE AND NOT HAD THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE DIED AND YOU CHOSE NOT TO WHAT'S WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU LIKE YOU KNOW S ANYWAY
POD1000000043_S0000070	THAT IDIOT IS AN IDIOT ON A PERSONAL LEVEL I JUST FEEL LIKE IT HAS BEEN LIKE REALLY NICE FOR ALL OF OUR MENTAL HEALTH TO WAKE UP AND READ THESE STORIES AND SEE THESE PHOTOS RIGHT I MEAN HANNA AND I CANCELED OUR PLANS TO SEE HER FAMILY AROUND THANKSGIVING

POD1000000043_S0000072	AND YOU KNOW TO LOVIT'S POINT I MEAN THIS VACCINE IS A MIRACLE NINETY FIVE PERCENT EFFECTIVE AND CREATED IN RECORD TIME I MEAN WE ARE SO SO LUCKY THAT IS SO MUCH FASTER THAN ANYTHING IN HISTORY
POD1000000043_S0000073	IT IS WAY MORE EFFECTIVE THAN YOUR STANDARD FLU VACCINE SO THIS IS A MIRACLE AND AND WE SHOUL JU BE CLEAR THE FIZER VACCINE WAS DEVELOPED BY A GERMAN COUPLE
POD1000000043_S0000074	RIGHT ONE OF THEM WAS BORN IN TURKEY AND EMMIGRATED TO GERMANY WHEN HE WAS FOUR THE OTHER IS THE DAUGHTER OF TURKISH IMMIGRANTS TO GERMANY SO FOR ALL OF TRUMP'S CREDIT GRAB WE HAVE GERMANS AND IMMIGRANTS TO THANK FOR THIS VISER VACCINE
POD1000000043_S0000075	THE THE OPERATION WARP SPEED FOLKS DESERVE SOME CREDIT FOR BUYING A HUNDRED MILLION DOSES OF THE FIZER VACCINE THEY DESERVE OUR ETERNAL HATRED AND SHAME FOR PASSING ON UP TO FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOSES AT NO COST TO THE U S I MEAN WE COULD HAVE JUST LIKE PAID WHEN WE GOT IT RIGHT
POD1000000043_S0000076	BUT YOU KNOW IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY SCIENTIFIC FEAT THERE'S SOME REALLY INTERESTING RESEARCH ABOUT HOW IN THE FUTURE WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO SPEED UP THIS PROCESS EVEN MORE AND WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PREPREPARE VACCINES FOR ALMOST ALL THE MAJOR KNOWN VIRUSES OUT THERE
POD1000000043_S0000077	WE COULD MAYBE CREATE A VACCINE FOR FIFTY TO A HUNDRED OF THE MOST OU KNOW SORT OF DANGEROUS PROMINENT VIRUSES FOR THE COST OF THE F THIRTY FIVE FIGHTER JET PROGRAM SO THAT SEEMS LIKE A A PRETTY GOOD DEAL COMPARED TO A PLANE WE MAY OR MAY NOT NEED TO USE
POD1000000043_S0000078	O LOTS OF GOOD NEWS TODAY YOU KNOW FEELING REALLY GOOD ABOUT THIS AND YOU KNOW IT WAS NICE TO SEE PEOPLE FEELING LESS SCARED BASICALLY
POD1000000043_S0000079	SO I JUST REMEMBER IN APRIL WHEN THIS STARTED DR FOUCHI SAID TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS FOR A VACCINE HOPEFULLY
POD1000000043_S0000080	AND THERE WERE A BUNCH OF EPIDEMIOLOGISTS SCIENTISTS AND OTHERS SAYING THAT FOUCHI'S TIMELINE WAS WAY TOO OPTIMISTIC FOR TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS ELEVEN MONTHS THAT'S WHAT THIS VACCINE CAME IN ELEVEN MONTHS
POD1000000043_S0000081	THE SHORTEST TIMELINE PREVIOUSLY FOR ANY VACCINE EVER WAS THE MUMPS VACCINE WHICH TOOK FOUR YEARS THAT WAS THE RECORD AND WE'VE GONE FROM FOUR YEARS TO ELEVEN MONTHS AND LIKE YOU KNOW TOMMY YOU JUST MENTIONED ABOUT THE NINETY FIVE PERCENT EFFECTIVE
POD1000000043_S0000082	FDA WAS READY TO APPROVE A VACCINE THAT WAS OVER FIFTY PERCENT EFFECTIVE NO LIKE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT EXPECTED NINETY FIVE PERCENT EFFECTIVE I MEAN THIS IS IT TRULY IS A MIRACLE
POD1000000043_S0000083	THEEERE THERE WERE HEADLINES BACK IN THE SPRING SAYING LIKE WE MAY NEVER GET A VACCINE SO NO II HAD THE SAME KIND OF YOU KNO HOPE AND OPTIMISM
POD1000000043_S0000084	THIS SECTION IS JOHN BASICALLY BEING SO MAD AT LIKE A SERIES OF OF ARTICLES IN THE ATLANTIC THAT WERE SO ANNOYING OVER THE COURSE OF MAN IT WAS LIKE THE DOOM AN GLOOM PUBLICATION OF CHOICE FOR SEVERAL MONTHS
POD1000000043_S0000085	I I'VE BEEN I'VE BEEN HOLDING BACK ON
POD1000000043_S0000087	THE ATLANTIC HAS SOME OF LIKE THE BEST JOURNALISTS IN THE WORLD AND WRITE SOME OF THE BEST FUCKING STUFF IN THE WORLD BUT THE NUMBER OF DOOMS DAY YOU CAN JUST GOOGLE THEM THE NUMBER OF DOOMSDAY HEADLINES NTHAT FUCKING PUBLICATION ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO LIVE FOREVER WITH THIS AND NEVER GO BE THE SAME IS RIDICULOUS
POD1000000043_S0000088	BUT ANYWAY
POD1000000043_S0000090	NO SO I WAS I WAS LIKE I WAS VERY HOPEFUL AND OPTIMISTIC TOO AND KIND OF WHAT YOU WERE SAYIN
POD1000000043_S0000092	LIKE IT
POD1000000043_S0000093	IT REALLY SPEAKS TO THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW OUR WORLD IS POLITICS AND WE TALK SO MUCH ABOUT POLITICS WE'RALL OBSESSED WITH POLITICS AND POLITICS IS REALLY BROKEN AND THE BROKENNESS OF POLITICS HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEATH AND DISASTER THAT HAS COME FROM THIS PANDEMIC
POD1000000043_S0000094	BUT OTHER PARTS OF SOCIETY ARE NOT BROKEN SCIENCE IS NOT BROKEN LIKE THI THIS WAS A FEAT OF SCIENCE AND JUST LIKE A MODERN MIRACLE THAT THAT WE SHOULD CELEBRATE
POD1000000043_S0000095	EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW POLITICS FAILED US A
POD1000000043_S0000097	EVERY OTHER WAY EVERY OTHER WAY
POD1000000043_S0000098	LI ALI ALSO JUST SAY TOO THAT LIKE FOUCHI SAID BASICALLY THAT HE WAS GOING TO SEE THIS VACCINE TO THE END
POD1000000043_S0000099	AND THAT THE COMPROMISES HE WAS MAKING YOU KNOW BEING INSIDE OF THIS ADMINISTRATION YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'E TALKED A LOT ABOUT PEOPLE SAYING THEY WERE COMPROMISING YOU KNOW NOT TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT TRUMP FOR THEIR OWN POLITICAL GAIN
POD1000000043_S0000100	FAILING TO MAKE ANY HEADWAY FAILING TO ACTUALLY STAND UP TO TRUMP ND OF DOING THE MORALLY REPREHENSIBLE AND EASY THING BUT LIKE HERE'S THIS GUY FAUCHI WHO I THINK LIKE WE WILL LOOK BACK AND SAY LIKE DID AN EXTRAORDINARY THING OF SERVING HIS COUNTRY
POD1000000043_S0000101	DESPITE THE THE HEADWINDS THAT WERE PRESENTED BY HIS BOSS DESPITE THE INCREDIBLE OBSTACLES SET UP BY DONALD TRUMP TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS CAME TO AN END AND LIKE HE'S A REAL YOU KNOW HE'S A HERO
POD1000000043_S0000103	YES SO TRUMP DID PUBLICLY PRESSURE THE FDA TO SPEED UP THE APPROVAL PROCESS FROM SATURDAY TO FRIDAY AND HIS CHIEF OF STAFF REPORTEDLY THREATENED TO FIRE FDA COMMISSIONER STEPHEN HAN IF THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN YOU GUYS SEE ANY PROBLEMS WITH THAT
POD1000000043_S0000104	I MEAN YEAH LOK L FIRT OFA LET'JJSTTALK ABOUT THIS ISSUE OF CREDIT FOR A MINUTE BECAUSE THERE'S ATHERE'S A DEBATE GOING ON TO BUT LIKE
POD1000000043_S0000105	WHEN WE'RE TALKING BOUTHE FIZER VACCINE THE US DESERVES CREDIT FOR MAKING AN ADVANCED PURCHASE OF THAT VACCINE IN JULY THEY GOT A HUNDRED MILLION DOSES
POD1000000043_S0000106	I ALREADY MENTIONED HOW ANGRY I AM THAT THEY DIDN'T ADVANCE PURCHASE SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION MORE DOSES BUT WHATEVER
POD1000000043_S0000107	BUT THE THING THAT'S INCREDIBLE AGAIN ABOUT THE MADERNA VACCINE IS THAT THAT VACCINE WAS DESIGNED JANUARY THIRTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY WE'VE HAD THIS VACCINE FORMULA IN OUR HANDS FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR
POD1000000043_S0000108	BECAUSE A VERY BRAVE CHINESE DOCTOR SEQUENCED THE GENOME AND PUBLICIZED IT AND THRER THESE ADVANCES IN M R AND A TECHNOLOGY THAT NONE OF US ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND BUT IT ALLOWED US TO PULL THIS OFF SO QUICKLY AND NOW THE PROBLEM BECOMES LOGISTICS
POD1000000043_S0000109	BUT I MEAN IN TERMS OF LIKE THREATENING THE FDA CHIEF I MEAN THERE'S A HUGE PROBLEM WITH THAT I MEAN EVEN THE TERM OPERATION WARP SPEED IS HORRIBLY PROBLEMATIC IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT FROM A MEDICAL POINT OF
POD1000000043_S0000110	WE KNOW TRUMP WANTS CREDIT FOR THE VACCINE BEING DEVELOPED QUICKLY BUT THIS ISN'T FAST FOOD LIKE NO ONE IS REALLY PUMPED ABOUT LIKE A A RUSHED MEDICAL PRODUCT RIGHT LIKE NO ONE'S GETTING THE THE FASTEST CREATED TYLANAL EVER
POD1000000043_S0000112	'S A BAD IDEA TO TALK ABOUT THIS AND AND TO TALK ABOUT IT AS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED QUICKLY OR IN A RUSHED MANNER AND SO GOING EVEN FURTHER TO POLITICIZE THE APPROVAL PROCESS IS A BAD IDEA
POD1000000043_S0000113	WHEN YOU'VE GOT LIKE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THERE'S SOME SUBSETS OF THE ANTI VAXER COMMUNITY THAT ARE KIND OF SUPER AGGRESSIVE AND DANGEROUS AND SPREAD MISINFORMATION
POD1000000043_S0000114	THEN THERE'S OTHER PEOPLE ESPECIALLY IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY WHO HAVE READ ABOUT THE TESKIGICIPHALUS STUDY AND HAVE SOME UNDERSTANDABLE HESITATION BASED ON THAT HISTORY ABOUT A NEW DRUG
POD1000000043_S0000115	SO THIS IS GOING TO REQUIRE A SERIOUS SCIENCE BASED PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY WHO DESPERATELY WANT A VACCINE BUT CAN'T HAVE
POD1000000043_S0000116	GHT LIKE IF YOU'RE GETTING CHEMOTHERAPY YOU CAN'T GET THE VACCINE IF YOU'RE UNDER SIXTEEN AS OF RIGHT NOW YOU CAN'T TAKE THE VACCINE IT'S NOT CLEAR WHEN IT'S GOIN TO BE APPROVED FOR PREGNANT WOMEN
POD1000000043_S0000117	AND SO IF THE VIRUS IS SWIRLING AROUND THE COUNTRY BECAUSE A BUNCH OF VACCINE ELIGIBLE PEOPLE JUST REFUSE TO TAKE IT THAT'LL PUT OTHERS AT RISK
POD1000000043_S0000118	AND SO THAT'S WHY YOU KNOW THE IT'S JUST IT'S HORRIBLE THAT WE HAVE TO READ THESE STORIES OVER AND OVER AGAIN TRUMP JUST POLITICIZING THE PROCESS WHEN IF HED JUST SHUT UP AND STEPPED BACK AND LET THE PROCESS WORK THINGS WOULD BE BETTER
POD1000000043_S0000119	FACT FIZER DIDN'T TAKE OPERATION WARP SPEED MONEY BECAUSE THEY WERE WORRIED THAT THE GOVERNMENT MIGHT SLOW THEM DOWN
POD1000000043_S0000121	AHI MEAN LIKE TRUMP IS THE WORST OFFENDER HERE BUT IT IS GOING TO BE A MAJOR CHALLENGE TO GET THE PUBLIC COMMUNICATION AROUND THIS CORRECT YOU KNOW EVEN FOR THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WHO'S GOING TO APPROACH IT IN GOOD FAITH YOU KNOW
POD1000000043_S0000122	EVEN YOU KNOW THE FDA APPROVAL PROCESS YOU KNOW IT WASN'T IT WASN'T AN UNANIMOUS DECISION AND SOME PEOPLE WERE LIKE ELL WHY DID SOME MEMBERS OF THE PANEL VOTE AGAINST IT WELL IT TURNS OUT THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED AGAINST IT WERE JUST SAYING OH I DON'T THINK IT'S READY FOR SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN YEAR
POD1000000043_S0000124	TO SPECIFIC AGES BUT IT'S LIKE THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT YOU ACTUALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE YOU COMMUNICATE CLEARLY TO PEOPLE BECAUSE IF YOU JUST SEE A NUMBER OH SOME PEOPLE VOTED AGAIST IT YOU THINK IT'S DANGEROUS IT'S NOT IT'S JUST THEY HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE AGES SO FAR YOU KNOW
POD1000000043_S0000125	SO THERE IS GOING TO BE LIKE THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS TOO MUCH PUBLIC COMMUNICATION AROUND THIS VACCINATION EFFORT AND IT REALLY HAS TO BE CONSISTENT AND DONE VERY WELL
POD1000000043_S0000126	WELL I MEAN LOOK THERE WAS SOMETHING SUCH A TO ME WAS SUCH LIKE A SIGNAL EXAMPLE OF WHAT TRUMP HAS DONE THROUGHOUT THIS PERIOD BECAUSE YEAH HE WAS COMPLAINING THAT OH THEY HELD BACK THE SAYING THAT THE VACCINE WORK
POD1000000043_S0000127	BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT TO HELP ME IN MY ELECTION RIGHT THAT WAS JUST IN THE PAST COUPLE WEEKS BUT THIS WAS LIKE
POD1000000043_S0000129	HE KNEW THE APPROVAL WAS GOING TO HAPPEN IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM HE WASN'T GOING TO SPEED IT UP HE WASN'T REALLY GOING TO SLOW IT DOWN THE VACCINE WAS GOING TO BE DELIVERED ON MONDAY
POD1000000043_S0000130	SO HE LIKE HECTERED AND HECTERED AND HECTERD TO ACHIEVE SOME MADEUP RESULT SO THAT HE COULD LOOK LIKE A TV PRESIDENT
POD1000000043_S0000132	THE OTHER PIECE OF THIS TOO IS THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPENED THAT HASN'T HAPPENED RIGHT LIKE
POD1000000043_S0000133	THERE SHOULD BE A PUBLIC CAMPAIGN GOING ON RIGHT NOW THAT DOESN'T EXIST ABOUT HOW THE VACCINEIS GOING TO BE DISTRIBUTED WHERE IT'S GOING TO GO LIKE THERE'S ALL THE ASPECTS OF PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP THAT HAVE JUST BEEN COMPLETELY MISSING IGT
POD1000000043_S0000134	LIKE IT'S WHY THERE AREN'T ENOUGH NNINETY FIVE MASS RIGHT NOW IT'S WHY THERE'S THERE THERE MAY BE SUPPLY PROBLEMS DOWN THE LINE WITH TE VACCINE AND IT'S WHY RIGHT NOW WE DON'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE WILL GET IT

POD1000000043_S0000200	I MEAN I THINK IT'S THIS IS NOW JUST A MASSIVE LOGISTICAL ISSUE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION TWO HUNDRED MILLION FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOSES IF EVERYBODY NEEDS TWO OF THEM ALL OF THOSE DOSES NEED TO BE CONTAINED IN A LITTLE VIALE
POD1000000043_S0000201	THEY ALL NEED TO BE MANUFACTURED AND THEY ALL NEED TO BE SHIPPED SOMEWHERE AND THEY ALL NEED TO BE DOLED OUT BY STATES THAT ARE REALLY SHORT ON CASH AND SO IT REALLY IS LIKE THANK GOD JOE BIDEN AND HIS TEAM ARE COMING IN BECAUSE IT REALLY IS JUST ABOUT COMPETENCY

POD1000000043_S0000203	IGUESS THA THING I DON'T UNDERSTAND AND I'M LOOK I'M TOTALLY OUT OF MY DEPTH HERE IS WHY THE U S GOVERNMENT ISN'T USING THE DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT TO MAYBE AID IN MANUFACTURING OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE OF THE VACCINE
POD1000000043_S0000204	M NOT SAYING THAT THEY SHOULD DO WHAT TRUMP SEEMS TO BE ATTEMPTING TO DO WITH HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER WHICH IS USE THE DPA OR USE THE GOVERNMENT TO SAY HEY FIZER ALL YOUR DOSES ARE FOR US THEY'RE NOT FOR OTHER COUNTRIES I LIKE THAT'S IMMORAL
POD1000000043_S0000205	AND IT'S NOT FEASIBLE BECAUSE THEY MANUFACTURE A LOT OF THESE DOSES OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY TOO BUT LIKE AT A MINIMUM WE COULD USE THE DPA TO RAMP UP PRODUCTION OF PPE
POD1000000043_S0000206	OR WE COULD USE MILITARY ASSETS TO TO SHIP SOME OF THESE VACCINES ESPECIALLY THE ONES THAT NEED TO BE STORED AT SUPER COLD TEMPERATURES WE COULD RAMP UP THE AVAILABILITY AND FREQUENCY OF TESTING

POD1000000043_S0000298	BUT LIKE TRUMP'S COVI DENIAL IS WORSE THAN THAT THIS THIS ELECTORAL FICTION HE'S PEDDLING IS WORSE THAN THAT AND SO IT'S A VERY SCARY THING
POD1000000043_S0000299	I WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT ITWILL BE DESTRUCTIVE FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND THAT MAYBE DEMOCRATS CAN WIN BUT THE ODDS ARE THAT TWENTY TWENTY TWO IS GOING TO BE BRUTAL BECAUSE OF REDISTRICTING AND SO WE SHOULDN'T COUNT ON
POD1000000043_S0000300	DT I DON'T KNOW THE WAY AROUND IT LIKE I HOPE THAT PEOPLE WILL GET TIRED OF A STICK BUT THAT WAS MY HOPE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND THEN SIXTEEN AND THEN YOU KNOW THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY HAPPENED AND OBVIOUSLY THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN

POD1000000043_S0000305	BECAUSE IF LIKE YOU KNOW IHAVE BEEN SAYING THAT A LOT OF THE CONCERN OVER DONALD TRUMP SUCCESSFULLY OVERTURNING THIS ELECTION IS IS A LITTLE OVER
POD1000000043_S0000306	BECAUSE WE HAVE DEMOCRATS IN ALL THE RIGHT POSITIONS BECAUSE WE CONTROLE THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES BECAUSE WE CONTROLLED THE GOVERNORSHIPS IN WISCONSIN MICHIGAN AND PENNSYLVANIA LIKE THAT'S THE ONLY REASON THAT I FELT SAFE
POD1000000043_S0000307	NN AND SAYING THAT JOE BIDEN IS GOING TO BE PRESIDENT IF WE HAVE A REPUBLICAN HOUSE IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR NOT ONLY DO I THINK THEY'LL HAVE IMPEACHED JOE BIDEN BY THEN THEY'LL JUST MAKE UP SOME REASON TO DO HAT
POD1000000043_S0000308	BUT THEN IN THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR ELECTION IF THE IF THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE OR IF IT'S TRUMP PULLS WHAT TRUMP PULLED AGAIN IT GOES TO CONGRESS AND NOW YOU HAVE A REPUBLICAN HOUSE
POD1000000043_S0000309	AND DO WE REALLY THINK THE REPUBLICAN HOUSE IS GOING TO PLAY BY THE RULES AFTER WHAT HAPPENED THIS TIME I DON'T THINK SO
POD1000000043_S0000310	YEAH I THINK WE SHOULD NOT CONFUSE THE FACT THAT THIS COUP WILL FAIL AND THAT ITS INSTIGATORS ARE SILLY AND BUFFOONISH FROM HOW DANGEROUS THIS MOMENT IS I DON'T THINK I THINK THAT THAT'S SORT OF TRIVIAL I THINK WE ALL GET THAT
POD1000000043_S0000311	BUT THEN I DO THINK THEN TH THERE'S THIS PROBLM IT'S LIKE OK WEL WHAT DO WE DO WELL WE KNOW WHAT WE NE TO DO WE NEED TO WIN ELECTIONS ALRIGHT AND THE PROBLEM IS WE JUST RAN A NATIONAL ELECTION
POD1000000043_S0000312	IN WHICH WE WON WE WON BY FOUR POINT FIVE PERCENT OF THE VOTE BUT GIVEN H WE WHERE OUR VOTERS ARE GIVEN SOME OF THE INHERENT ANTI DEMOCRATIC ASPECTS OF THE SENATE
POD1000000043_S0000313	IT WAS NOT ENOUGH TO TO WIN THA TO WIN THE SENATE AND WE STILL MANAGED TO LOSE SOME HOUSE SEATS AND THOSE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS ARE NOT GOING ANYWERE WE'RE NOT ABOLISHING THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE
POD1000000043_S0000314	IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS WE'RE NOT GETTING RID OF THE SENATE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME REALLY BAD REDISTRICTING THAT'S GOING TO HURT US BECAUSE WE DID SO POORLY IN LEGISLATURE
POD1000000043_S0000315	AND SO TO ME LIKE I DO THINK WE HAVE TO SPLIT THESE THINGS INTO KIND OF TWO BIG DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS ONE IS HOW DO WE WIN INSIDE OF DEMOCRACY AND THE OTHER IS HOW DO WE PRESERVE DEMOCRACY AND FIGHT FOR IT AGAINST A PARTY THAT HAS ABAND
POD1000000043_S0000316	I NO LONGER AM INTERESTED IN STORIES ABOUT HOW REPUBLICANS BEHIND THE SCENES SAY THEY DON'T REALLY MEAN IT NO YOU DO MEAN IT THIS IS IT IT'S NOT YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT IN PRIVATE SAYING THAT YOU DON'T SUPPORT WHAT YOU SUPPORT

POD1000000043_S0000323	YEAH AND AND I WOULD SAY TOO LIKE THE NEXT THE THE CONVERSATION WE SHOULD HAVE IS OBVIOUSLY NOT ABOUT SHAME BUT I DO THINK WE SHOULD BE TALKING AND I DO THINK HIT'S A MUCH LONGER TERM CHALLENGE THAN EVEN WHAT WE'LL HAVE TO DO ELECTORALLY TO KEEP THE HOUSE AND TO KEEP THE WHITE HOUSE
POD1000000043_S0000324	AND IT IS LIKE ALL RIGHT THEY'RE SHAMELESS THEY'RE MERCENARIES THEY'RE DOING WHAT THEY THINK IS IN THEIR INTEREST WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY DON'T VIEW DEFENDING DEMOCRACY AS IN THEIR INTEREST RIGHT THAT THAT PROPAGANDA HAS SO THOROUGHLY TAKEN HOLD
POD1000000043_S0000325	LIKE WHEN YOU SAY LIKE THEY DON'T RESPOND TO SHAME LIKE WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IT MEANS THAT LIKE VIRTUE INTEGRITY THESE QUALITIES NO LONGER MATTER IN OUR POLITICS BEING HONEST CARING ABOUT THE BASIC CIVIC IDEAS THAT ARE THE BEDROCK OF OUR COUNTRY THEY'RE NOT IMPORTANT ANYMORE

POD1000000043_S0000437	AND SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT THINK REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS SHOULD TRY TO KEEP IN TRUMP IN POWER BUT THEN I SAW AT THE END THE LAST QUESTION WAS FORTY PERCENT OF TRUMP VOTERS BELIEVE THAT IF BIDEN IS THE PRESIDENT

POD1000000044_S0000066	ALVIN DIED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN BUT THIS IS HOWARD A PSYCHOTHERAPIST AND ONE OF ALVIN'S DISCIPLES HOWARD RUNS ALVIN'S WEBSITE AND PUBLISHES HIS BOOKS
POD1000000044_S0000067	ARE YOU TALKING A LITTLE HYPERBOLICALLY WHEN YOU SAY A WHOLE NEW PERSON
POD1000000044_S0000068	IT IS THAT RADICAL JONATHAN IT'S TO BECOME A WHOLE NEW PERSON THE TERM YO USE IS AN OPTIMAL PERSON AND TO DISCOVER THAT WITHIN YOURSELF
POD1000000044_S0000070	ACCORDING TO ALVIN ONCE YOU'VE DISCOVERED THIS OPTIMAL PERSONHOOD YOU CAN SHAKE OFF WHAT OTHERS WANT AND LIVE ON YOUR OWN TERMS
POD1000000044_S0000071	IT CHANGED MY LIFE DIRECTION
POD1000000044_S0000072	AND FOR THESE KINDS OF RADICAL RESULTS ALVIN WAS GIVEN A LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD FROM THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION
POD1000000044_S0000073	ONE PSYCHOLOGY TEXTBOOK EVEN GOES SO FAR AS TO DESCRIBE ALVIN AS BEING QUOTE AS IMPORTANT AS FREUYD
POD1000000044_S0000075	BUT THIS ISN'T A STORY ABOUT ALVAN'S PROFESSIONAL LIFE HIS LIFE INSIDE THE OFFICE THIS IS A STORY ABOUT ALVAN'S REAL LIFE
POD1000000044_S0000076	HE INSISTED I RAN AWAY
POD1000000044_S0000077	THIS IS RACHEL ALVIN'S DAUGHTER
POD1000000044_S0000078	AND I DID
POD1000000044_S0000079	HOW OLD WERE YOU
POD1000000044_S0000080	S IN GRADE FIVE
POD1000000044_S0000081	THE YEAR WAS NINETEEN SEVENTY ALVAN AND RACHEL'S MOM HAD BEEN LOCKED IN AN UGLY CUSTODY BATTLE FOR EIGHT YEARS
POD1000000044_S0000082	RACHEL'S MOM WAS POOR AND STRUGGLED WITH DEPRESSION RACHEL REALLY WANTED TO LIVE WITH HER DAD SO WHEN ALVIN SUGGESTED SHE RUN AWAY FROM JUDY IN DENVER TO HIS HOUSE IN OHIO RACHEL DIDN'T PACK A BAG SHE DIDN'T SAY GOODBYE TO ANYONE
POD1000000044_S0000083	SHE JUST LAUGHED
POD1000000044_S0000084	LIKE HE SET UP THIS WHOLE THING WITH HIS LAWYER AND I JUST FELT LIKE I NEEDED TO DO WHAT MY DAD AND THE LAWYER TOLD ME AND THIS WAS THE RIGHT THING I THINK I SAID I WAS GOING TO THE LIBRARY AND
POD1000000044_S0000085	SOMEHOW I DON'T REMEMBER HOW I GOT TO THE LAWYER'S OFFICE AND THEN THEY TOOK ME TO THE AIRPORT AND PUT ME ON THE PLANE AND I LAFT
POD1000000044_S0000087	ALVAN HAD GOTTEN REMARRIED TO A WOMAN WITH TWO KIDS AND RACHEL LOVED FEELING LIKE SHE WAS A PART OF THIS HAPPY FAMILY THERE WERE DOGS TO PLAY WITH AND BIKES TO RIDE AND YET THIS OTHER FEELING WOULD OFTEN CREEP IN
POD1000000044_S0000088	I MISS MY MOM I MISS MY FRIENDS I MISS MY CAT BUT I COULD NEVER EVER EVER SAY THAT OUT LOUD TO ANYBODY
POD1000000044_S0000089	AND THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE RACHEL MISSED MISSED MOST OF ALL
POD1000000044_S0000091	SHE TOLD US SHE WAS GOING TO THE LIBRARY AND THEN SHE NEVER CAME BACK
POD1000000044_S0000092	THIS IS RACHEL'S BROTHER JOHN HE'S TWO AND A HALF YEARS YOUNGER THAN RACHEL AND ONLY HAS FLASHES OF EARLY CHILDHOOD MEMORY ABOUT ALVIN
POD1000000044_S0000093	HE RECALLS DOING FATHER SON THINGS THATULD MAKE PERFECT SENSE IF THE SON WAS AN ADULT THINGS LIKE LIFTING WEIGHTS TOGETHER AND SMOKING
POD1000000044_S0000094	HE WAS A PIPESMOKER HE BOUGHT ME MY OWN LITTLE CHERRYWOOD PIPE AND YOU KNOW AS A FOUR YEAR OLD HE ACTUALLY HAD ME SMOKING YOU KNOW TOBACCO IN THE PIPE WITH HIM
POD1000000044_S0000095	IT WAS AS THOUGH ALVAN COULDN'T DISTINGUISH BETWEEN ADULTS AND CHILDREN WHICH WAS WHY HE SAW JOHN'S CLOSENESS WITH HIS MOM NOT AS A CHILD'S NATURAL MATERNAL ATTACHMENT BUT RATHER AS A PERSONAL SLIGHT
POD1000000044_S0000096	AND SO ALVIN NEVER ASKED JOHN TO RUN AWAY JOHN WAS LEFT BEHIND IN DENVER WITH JUDY
POD1000000044_S0000097	I THINK IN HIS MIND I JUST YOU KNOW WAS MORE A MAMMA'S BOY AND A CHIP OFF JUDY'S BLOCK AND I THINK HE SORT OF GAVE UP ON ME AND HE WAS REALLY FOCUSED ON RACHEL
POD1000000044_S0000098	AND AS THE FINAL CUSTODY HEARING APPROACHED ALVIN'S FOCUS ON RACHEL INTENSIFIED HE WANTED TO PROVE TO THE COURT THAT RACHEL WAS BETTER OFF WITH HIM SO HE HAD ABOUT A HALF DOZEN SOCIAL WORKERS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS OFFER ASSESSMENTS
POD1000000044_S0000099	RACHEL WAS INTERVIEWED AND ALVIN'S NEW FAMILY OBSERVED NONE OF THE EXPERTS SPOKE TO JUDY AND THE PLAN WORKED
POD1000000044_S0000100	IN THE AUTUMN OF NINETEEN SEVENTY A JUDGE RULED THAT RACHEL WOULD BE ALLOWED TO STAY IN OHIO WITH AL FOR GOOD BUT JOHN WOULD REMAIN IN DENVER WITH JUDY
POD1000000044_S0000101	AND WE NEVER LIVE TOGETHER AGAIN
POD1000000044_S0000103	WHEN YOU HAVE A SIBLING WHO IS JUST A CRITICAL PART OF YOUR FAMILY AND THEN YOU'RE SEPARATED FROM THEM IT'S A WOUND
POD1000000044_S0000104	HOW UNCOMMON WAS SOMETHING WAS AN ARRANGEMENT LIKE THAT
POD1000000044_S0000105	EXTREME YEAH VERY VERY UNCOMMON KIDS ARE NOT SPLIT UP
POD1000000044_S0000106	WE EACH GREW UP ALONE I MISSED HER THROUGH MY WHOLE CHILDHOOD I MISSED HER A LOT
POD1000000044_S0000107	I MEAN WE WERE WE WERE SO CLOSE WHEN WE WERE YOUNG AND YOU KNOW SHE WAS THE BIG SISTER WHO THROUGH ALL OF THAT WAS LOOKING OUT FOR ME
POD1000000044_S0000109	GROWING UP FROM THEN ON JUST ME AND MY MOM GREW UP AS AN ONLY CHILD AND MY MOM JUST ALWAYS BEING IN PAIN AND
POD1000000044_S0000110	SHE NEVER WAS ABLE TO ENJOY WHATEVER IT IS WE WERE DOING AT THE MOMENT IT WAS ALWAYS OH IF ONLY RACHEL WERE HERE WE COULD ALL BE TOGETHER AND I'D BE SAYING BUT BUT WE'RE HERE NOW
POD1000000044_S0000112	WHEN HE TURNED THIRTEEN JOHN INVITED RACHEL TO HIS BAR MITZVA BUT ALVAN WOULDN'T LET HER GO RACHEL SENT A POEM INSTEAD
POD1000000044_S0000113	IT HAD TO DO WITH A RUBBER BAND STRETCHING ACROSS THE DISTANCE AND CONNECTING US
POD1000000044_S0000115	FOR JOHN NOT ONLY DID HE LOSE HIS BIG SISTER HE ALSO LOST HIS DAD YEAR AFTER YEAR JOHN TRIED TO REENTER ALVAN'S LIFE BUT EACH TIME HE REACHED OUT ALVIN REBUKED HIM
POD1000000044_S0000116	ONE TIME AS AN ADOLESCENT JOHN TRIED SCHEDULING A VISIT
POD1000000044_S0000117	AND HE SAID WELL AS LONG AS YOU GUYS YOU KNOW ME AND MY MOM REQUIRED ANY MONEY ANY CHILD SUPPORT THERE'D BE NO VISIT
POD1000000044_S0000118	AND I SAID WELL IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU CARE MORE ABOUT MONEY THAN ABOUT ME AND HE SAID WELL I DON'T WANT IT TO JUST SOUND LIKE THAT THAT'S HOW IT IS
POD1000000044_S0000120	NEVERTHELESS A FEW YEARS LATER JOHN ASKED ONCE AGAIN IF HE COULD COME VISIT BY THIS POINT RACHEL WAS EIGHTEEN AND NO LONGER LIVING WITH ALVIN
POD1000000044_S0000121	SO WHEN ALVIN REFUSED JOHN YET AGAIN RACHEL TOLD HER BROTHER TO COME VISIT HER INSTEAD THEY HADN'T SEEN EACH OTHER IN EIGHT YEARS WAS SHE THE SAME SISTER THAT YOU REMEMBERED
POD1000000044_S0000122	NO I MEAN I KNEW HER AS A YOU KNOW
POD1000000044_S0000124	SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE TEN YEAR OLD NEXT TIME I SAW HER SHE WAS AN ADULT
POD1000000044_S0000126	IN THE YEARS SINCE THAT VISIT RACHEL AND JOHN HAVE MADE A POINT OF STAYING IN EACH OTHER'S LIVES THEY TALK ON THE PHONE CELEBRATE HOLIDAYS TOGETHER AND ONCE A YEAR THEIR FAMILIES ALL TAKE A TRIP BUT THEIR CHILDHOOD TOGETHER THAT'S BEEN LOST
POD1000000044_S0000127	I MEAN MY DAUGHTER CERTAINLY WATCHES US AND THINKS THAT WE'RE MORE LIKE COUSINS SHE CAN SEE THE THE DISCONNECT BECAUSE WE DID NOT GROW UP TOGETHER
POD1000000044_S0000128	JOHN AND RACHEL STILL HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR CHILDHOOD BUT NOW THAT THEIR PARENTS ARE BOTH DEAD THEY HAVE NO ONE TO ASK SO THEY PARSE THROUGH THEIR SEPARATE MEMORIES TRYING TO CONSTRUCT A TIMELINE COMPARING MOMENTS OF OVERLAP AND FILLING IN THE BLANKS
POD1000000044_S0000129	TO THIS END ONE NIGHT WHILE JOHN WAS VISITING RACHEL FOR THANKSGIVING HE ASKED IF THEY COULD GO THROUGH ALVIN'S FILES
POD1000000044_S0000131	ALVIN WAS AN OBSESSIVE RECORD KEEPER AND AFTER HE DIED RACHEL INHERITED HIS PAPERS SHE'D NEVER REALLY GONE THROUGH THEM KEEPING THEM STORED AWAY IN A FILING CABINET BUT THAT NIGHT SHE PULLED THEM OUT
POD1000000044_S0000132	AND TOGETHER JOHN AND RACHEL MADE A SERIES OF DISTURBING DISCOVERIES THE FIRST OF WHICH WAS THE SCRIPT
POD1000000044_S0000134	HE SCRIPT FOR ME WAS LIKE OH MY GOD
POD1000000044_S0000136	HE SCRIPT WAS A LENGTHY DIATRIBE WRITTEN BY ALVIN FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF A CHILD RACHEL'S POINT OF VIEW
POD1000000044_S0000137	IN IT ALVAN REFERS TO HIMSELF AS DADDY JUDY IS MOTHER OR JUDY OR SIMPLY SHE I LATER ASK RACHEL TO READ SOME OVER THE PHONE
POD1000000044_S0000139	TWO AND A HALF PAGES LONG IN SMALL PSYCHOLOGIST'S WRITING OKA SO HERE I GO IT'S IN MY GOOD HAPPY DREAMS CUSTODY IS CHANGED AND I LIVE WITH DADDY
POD1000000044_S0000140	IF I AM FORCED TO GO BACK AND LIVE WITH MOTHER IT WILL ONLY BE TILL THE DAY I'M FOURTEEN WHICH APPARENTLY WAS WHEN YOU COULD DECIDE
POD1000000044_S0000141	WHEN I'M WITH HER I FEEL SCARED THAT I MIGHT GET TIGHT AND ANGRY AND COLD LIKE JUDY SHE'S NOT A MOTHER SHE IS A KEEPER SHE MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I'M IN A PRISON I CAN'T LET HER TOUCH ME
POD1000000044_S0000142	IT WAS LIKE FINDING YOUR CHILDHOOD INTERNAL MONOLOGUE COMMITTED TO PAPER AND WRITTEN IN YOUR FATHER'S HANDWRITING RACHEL DIDN'T REMEMBER SEEING THE SCRIPT AS A KID BUT SHE REMEMBERED SAYING THOSE THINGS AND SHE REMEMBERED THINKING THEM
POD1000000044_S0000143	IN ONE OF ALVIN'S MANY BOOKS A VOLUME ENTITLED THE MANUAL OF OPTIMAL BEHAVIOR HE WRITES THAT BEHAVIOR CAN BE REHEARSED AND MODIFIED QUOTE UNTIL YOU ARE READY AND EAGER TO GO AHEAD AND DO WHAT YOU HAVE REHEARSED AND MODIFIED
POD1000000044_S0000144	UNBEKNOWNS TO HER ALVIN WAS HAVING RACHEL REHEARSE AND MODIFY
POD1000000044_S0000145	IT WAS SO
POD1000000044_S0000147	EXPLICIT IT THERE WAS NOTHING SUBTLE ABOUT IT YOU KNOW THE WHOLE THING WAS SICK
POD1000000044_S0000149	HE SECOND THING DISCOVERED AMONG THE FILES WAS A LETTER FROM RACHEL TO HER MOM IN IT SHE BEGS JUDY TO LET HER LIVE WITH ALVIN BUT THERE WERE TWO COPIES ONE WRITTEN IN RACHEL'S HAND AND ONE WRITTEN IN ALVIN'S
POD1000000044_S0000151	GOING THROUGH THE PAPERS RACHEL REMEMBERED OTHER THINGS HOW ALVIN ENCOURAGED HER NOT TO SMILE WHEN SHE WAS WITH HER MOM SAYING IF SOMEONE PHOTOGRAPHED HER HAPPY IT COULD BE USED AS EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM IN COURT
POD1000000044_S0000152	IN EVERY PHOTO FROM THAT PERIOD WITH HER MOTHER RACHEL IS WEARING A FROWN
POD1000000044_S0000153	THAT'S WHEN I STARTED QUESTIONING AND STARTED TO REALIZE THAT I WAS COACHED OR BRAINWASHED
POD1000000044_S0000155	IT MADE SENSE FOR MOST OF HER ADULT LIFE RACHEL HAD HAD NO MEMORY OF LOVING HER MOM IT WAS ONLY AFTER HER MOTHER'S DEATH WHEN SHE FOUND MOTHER'S DAY AND BIRTHDAY CARD SHE'D WRITTEN TO JUDY WHEN SHE WAS VERY SMALL
POD1000000044_S0000156	THAT RACHEL REALIZED SHE HAD I LOVE YOU MOMMY SHE'D WRITTEN I LOVE YOU SO MUCH BUT WITH AL'S CONSTANT COACHING IT HAD ALL BEEN STAMPED OUT
POD1000000044_S0000158	THE FINAL THING JOHN AND RACHEL FOUND THAT NIGHT WERE THOSE PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORTS ALVAN HAD RACHEL SUBMIT TO JUST BEFORE THE FINAL CUSTODY HEARING IN THEM YOU SEE ALVAN'S SCRIPTING BEARE OUT
POD1000000044_S0000159	ONE REPORT NOTES THAT RACHEL KEPT REPEATING QUOTE I WANT TO LIVE WITH MY FATHER HE LOVES ME MY MOTHER DOESN'T LOVE ME THE REPORT NOTES THAT SHE SAID THIS WITH QUOTE GRIM DETERMINATION
POD1000000044_S0000161	THEY ALSO UNCOVERED ONE PARTICULAR REPORT THAT NIGHT THAT WAS LONGER THAN ANY OF THE OTHERS IT WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT EVALUATED BOTH JOHN AND RACHEL AND IN THIS IT CARRIED THE MOST WEIGHT
POD1000000044_S0000163	AND WHAT SHOCKED JOHN AND RACHEL MOST OF ALL
POD1000000044_S0000164	MY DAD CLEARLY EDITED EDITED IT AND THEN SHE REWROTE IT WITH THE EDITS AND SUBMITTED THAT REWRITE
POD1000000044_S0000165	IS THAT ETHICAL AS A SOCIAL WORKER
POD1000000044_S0000166	NO NO NO NO NO NO IT'S NOT NO OH NO NO NO NO ONE SHOULD EVER LET ANYBODY ELSE ESPECIALLY THEIR CLIENT EDIT THEIR REPORTS NO IT'S IT'S REALLY BAD
POD1000000044_S0000167	THE REPORT WAS WRITTEN BY A SOCIAL WORKER NAMED JOYCE
POD1000000044_S0000169	ALVAN'S EDITS TO JOYCE'S REPORT MADE THE LANGUAGE MORE EMPHATIC FOR EXAMPLE WHERE JOYCE HAD WRITTEN THAT RACHEL WAS HESITANT WHEN IT CAME TO JUDY ALVAN CHANGED IT TO SAY SHE WAS FEARFUL IN ANOTHER SPOT
POD1000000044_S0000170	HE ADDED THAT RACHEL WANTED TO BLOT OUT ANY MEMORY OF EVER HAVING BEEN AWAY FROM HIM
POD1000000044_S0000171	HONESTLY I MEAN IT WAS HORRIFYING YOU KNOW JUST TO SEE THE DETAILED NOTES TO SEE THE EDITED DRAFTS THE CROSS OUTS AN HIS HANDWRITING
POD1000000044_S0000172	AND THEN THE FINAL VERSION THAT WAS SUBMITTED TO THE COURTS WITH HIS EDITS IN THERE LIKE THERE'S NO QUESTION WHAT HAPPENED
POD1000000044_S0000174	THE REPORT CONCLUDES WITH A RECOMMENDATION THE STRONGEST ONE OF ANY REPORT AND THE ONLY RECOMMENDATION OF ITS KIND
POD1000000044_S0000175	SHE RECOMMENDED THAT I LIVE WITH HIM AND THAT MY BROTHER LIVE WITH MY MOM
POD1000000044_S0000176	JOHN AND RACHEL'S SEPARATION CAME DOWN TO A DECISION DICTATED BY ALVIN AND SIGNED OFF ON BY JOYCE
POD1000000044_S0000178	HOW WAS ALVIN ABLE TO EXERT THIS KIND OF POWER OVER A SOCIAL WORKER SOMEONE WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AN IMPARTIAL OUTSIDER JOHN AND RACHEL COULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT
POD1000000044_S0000179	BUT THAT NIGHT WHEN RACHEL GOOGLED JOYCE SHE WAS SHOCKED TO REALIZE THAT JOYCE HADN'T BEEN AN IMPARTIAL OUTSIDER AT ALL JOYCE WAS A FAMILY FRIEND
POD1000000044_S0000181	RACHEL RECOGNIZED JOYCE AS THE KIND DARK HAIRED WOMAN WHOSE HOUSE SHE VISITED AS A CHILD
POD1000000044_S0000182	RACHEL WOULD BRING HER CHELLO OVER TO PLAY MUSIC WITH JOYCE AND HER FAMILY WHICH MEANS THAT ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE WRONG WITH THE REPORT JOYCE SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN THE PERSON TO WRITE IT IN THE FIRST PLACE
POD1000000044_S0000183	SHE WAS LIKE THE ONE PERSON IN MY LIFE AS A KID WHO COULD HAVE SAID HEY I THINK YOU'RE COACHING HER AND THIS ISN'T RIGHT
POD1000000044_S0000184	WHY ARE WE GOING TO TRY AND SPLIT THESE KIDS UP SHE WAS THE ONE WHO COULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING
POD1000000044_S0000185	IN NINETEEN SEVENTY JOYCE RECOMMENDED THAT MY SISTER GO WITH MY FATHER AND THAT I GO WITH MY MOTHER AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED
POD1000000044_S0000187	AND THAT DICTATED THE COURSE OF MY LIFE WHAT HAPPENED
POD1000000044_S0000189	THIS IS THE QUESTION THAT'S BEEN NAGGING AT JOHN AND RACHEL SINCE THEY FOUND THE REPORT HOW COULD THIS HAVE HAPPENED AND SO JOHN AND RACHEL WANT TO FIND JOYCE AND ASK HER
POD1000000044_S0000190	WHAT I DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND THOUGH IS WHAT I HAVE TO OFFER RACHEL AND JOHN ARE BOTH PRACTICING THERAPISTS THEMSELVES THEY'RE MORE THAN CAPABLE OF POSING DIFFICULT QUESTIONS
POD1000000044_S0000191	AND ALTHOUGH I PLAY A MENTAL HEALTH SEMI PROFESSIONAL SEMI CONVINCINGLY ON A PODCAST I'M NOT ACTUALLY ONE AT ALL WHAT WHAT CAN I DO
POD1000000044_S0000192	WELL SO I HAVE HAD TO ADVOCATE FOR MYSELF MY ENTIRE LIFE FROM A VERY YOUNG AGE AND NOBODY ADVOCATED FOR ME OR MY BROTHER
POD1000000044_S0000193	AND SO IF YOU COULD HELP ME WITH THIS IT WOULD BE A HEALING PIECE FOR ME THAT SOMEBODY ELSE ADVOCATED FOR ME

POD1000000044_S0000452	FOR JOHN IT ALWAYS OCCASIONED A WEIRD MIX OF PRIDE IN HIS FATHER'S CAREER AND BITTERNESS OVER HIS PERSONAL REJECTION
POD1000000044_S0000453	AT ONE CONFERENCE JOHN ATTENDED ALVIN'S LECTURE IN THE HOPE OF FORCING HIS FATHER TO TALK TO HIM
POD1000000044_S0000454	ALVIN SAW JOHN IN THE AUDIENCE BUT AFTERWARDS MADE HIM WAIT ONLINE ALONG WITH ALL HIS ADORING FANS EVENTUALLY JOHN GREW FRUSTRATED AND LEFT
POD1000000044_S0000455	IT'S ONE OF THE MYSTERIES OF MY LIFE HOW HE JUSTIFIED OR RATIONALIZED TO HIMSELF YOU KNOW HAVING A SON AND AND SUPPOSEDLY LOVING HIM
POD1000000044_S0000456	AND THEN JUST CUTTING HIM OFF AND REJECTING HIM FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE I DON'T I CAN'T FATHOM THAT AT ALL

POD1000000044_S0000463	NEAR THE END OF ALVAN'S LIFE JOHN WANTED TO MAKE ONE LAST EFFORT TO SEE HIS FATHER SO ALVAN COULD MEET HIS GRANDKIDS
POD1000000044_S0000464	BUT RACHEL COUNSELED JOHN NOT TO GO SHE SAID THAT ALVIN WOULD REFUSE TO SEE HIM AND WAS STILL SO FULL OF ANGER THAT HE MIGHT EVEN CALL THE POLICE
POD1000000044_S0000465	AFTER HIS DEATH ALVIN LEFT BEHIND A WILL WITH A SECTION LISTING THE NAMES OF THOSE WHO WRONGED HIM EACH PERSON WAS TO RECEIVE A SINGLE DOLLAR AMONG THEM WAS JOHN
POD1000000044_S0000466	BACK WHEN I SPOKE TO AL'S DISCIPLE HOWARD HE TOLD ME THAT AL WAS BEDRIDDEN AT THE END OF HIS LIFE YET HE WAS STILL FOCUSED ON HIS THERAPEUTIC METHOD

POD1000000044_S0000473	ENI RAISED THE SUBJECT OF ALVIN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS KIDS AND HOW THAT CONNECTED TO HIS OPTIMAL SELF HOWARD SAYS HE CAN'T REALLY SPEAK TO THAT ALVN DIDN'T BRING UP HIS KIDS MUCH

POD1000000044_S0000475	BUT I DON'T THINK WHATEVER HAPPENS AT A CERTAIN POINT IN SOMEONE'S LIFE SHOULD DEFINE THEM FOR WHO THEY ARE AS A PERSON OVERALL

POD1000000045_S0000115	BUT I THOUGHT YOU KNOW WHAT LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT WE MIGHT HAVE MISSED IN BOOKS AND READING THIS YEAR BUT I WANTED TO KIND OF BREAK IT DOWN INTO CATEGORIES
POD1000000045_S0000116	BECAUSE WE HAVE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF WOMEN WHO LISTEN EVERY WEEK SO OF COURSE IN A GROUP THAT BIG THERE'S GOING TO BE YOU KNOW CERTAIN KINDS OF READERS SO I THOUGHT OKAY LET'S THINK ABOUT LIKE WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CATEGORIES OF READERS
POD1000000045_S0000117	BECAUSE I KNOW IF I TELL YOU A CATEGORY I KNOW I CAN COUNT ON KATIE TO PICK OUT A BOOK FOR THAT READER SO I PICKED OUT SEVEN CATEGORIES
POD1000000045_S0000118	I'M GONG TO THROW THE CATEGORY AT YOU YOU TELL US WHAT YOU THINK WOULD BE A GOOD READ THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE PICKED UP RECENTLY AND SPEAKING OF PICKING IT UP RECENTLY
POD1000000045_S0000119	I THOUGHT THE FIRST CATEGORY THT WOULD BE FUN WOULD BE LIKE THE BUZZ BOOK READER THIS IS THE READER WHO LOVES TO BE IN THE LOOP ON THE BOOKS THAT EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT WHETHER YOU HANG OUT IN LIKE A FACEBOOK GROUP THAT'S DEVOTED TO READING OR YOU JUST LIKE TO YOU KNOW
POD1000000045_S0000120	I WAS GOING TO SAY AT DINNER PARTIES WHATEVER THOSE WERE
POD1000000045_S0000122	IF YOU JUST LIKE TO CHAT WITH PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE BEEN READING AND YOU LIKE A GOOD BOOK THAT EVERYBODY'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT KATIE WHAT ARE SOME GOOD PICKS FOR OUR READERS WHO LOVE BUZZY BOOKS
POD1000000045_S0000123	OKAY SO THE FIRST ONE THAT CAME TO MIND FOR THIS CATEGORY I JUST READ IN SEPTEMBER I THINK AND IT IS CALLED THE INVISIBLE LIFE OF ADDI LARU
POD1000000045_S0000124	I HAVE THAT GO AHEAD SORRY I GOT SO EXCITED I'VE BEEN INTERRUPTING YOU ALREADY OKAY GO AHEAD YES
POD1000000045_S0000126	THE AUTHOR IS V E SCHWAB THIS BOOK HAS BEEN EVERYWHERE IT WAS A BOOK OF THE MONTH PICK THAT'S HOW I GOT IT THE COVER IS GORGEOUS IT'S BLACK IT'S GOT THESE GOLD LETTERS IT'S JUST BEAUTIFUL
POD1000000045_S0000127	OKA YES I HAVE TO TELL YOU I GOT IT AS MY BOOK OF THE MONTH PICK AND I HAVE YET TO OPEN IT KATIE SELL ME ON THIS
POD1000000045_S0000129	BASIC SETUP IS ADELINE LARU SHE LIVES IN THE SEVENTEEN HUNDREDS SHE'S IN A FRENCH VILLAGE OUTSIDE THE CITY WITH HER PARENTS SHE BASICALLY MAKES A DEAL WITH THE DEVIL
POD1000000045_S0000130	WHO SHE CALLS THE DARKNESS TO GET HER OUT OF THIS KIND OF STICKY SITUATION BUT THE CATCH IS THAT SHE WILL LIVE BASICALLY FOREVER AND FREE
POD1000000045_S0000131	BUT THAT ANY TIME SOMEONE SEES HER ONCE THEY TURN THEIR BACK ON HER THEY TOTALLY FORGET SHE EVER EXISTED
POD1000000045_S0000132	SO THE STORY BOUNCES BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE SEVENTEEN HUNDREDS AND THEN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WHERE SOMEBODY REMEMBERS HER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER THREE HUNDRED YEARS OF LIFE
POD1000000045_S0000133	SO THAT'S WHERE OUR STORY BOUNCES OFF FROM THERE AND I JUST LOVED IT THE WRITING IS ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS THE EXPERIENCES THAT SHE HAS I'M SURE YOU CAN IMAGINE THEY MAKE FOR SOME REALLY INTERESTING YOU KNOW MEETINGS WITH PEOPLE
POD1000000045_S0000135	THEY FORGET HER IMMEDIATELY AND SO I JUST REALLY LOVED IT THERE'S A LOT OF ART AND LITERATURE AND WRITING KIND OF BUILT INTO THE STORY TOO THAT JUST I LOVED I
POD1000000045_S0000136	OKAY I FEEL SO PROUD OF MYSELF THAT EVEN IN A YEAR WHEN I'M NOT CONNECTED TO READING I ACTUALLY PICKED A BOOK THAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT SO THERE YO GO MAYBE OVER THE CHRISTMAS BREAK I'LL HAVE A LITTLE TIME TO FINALLY CRACK IT OPEN AND READ IT
POD1000000045_S0000137	YES I'VE HEARD THE AUDIO IS VERY GOOD TOO THAT IS NOT HOW I READ IT BUT I'VE HEARD THAT IT IS VERY GOOD ON AUDIO AS WELL SO
POD1000000045_S0000138	PERFECT PERFECT OKA DID YOU HAVE ANY OTHER PICKS FOR THE BUZZ
POD1000000045_S0000140	ONE MORE AND THIS WAS ONE OF THE ONES THAT WAS UP FOR BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR ON GOOD READS AND THIS IS CALLED THE GIRL WITH THE LOUDING VOICE BY ABBY DARA

POD1000000045_S0000291	AND SO IT KIND OF TELLS YOU ABOUT THEIR OVERALL LIKE DAILY LIFE AND THEN THEIR PROCESS OF GOING THROUGH THE UN AND THEN COMING TO AMERICA
POD1000000045_S0000292	BUT HIS BROTHER IS A PERSON WITH DISABILITIES AND SO HE FEELS LIKE HE HAS TO JUST TAKE CARE OF HIS BROTHER ALL THE TIME
POD1000000045_S0000293	AND SO IT'S A VERY SWEET STORY ABOUT BROTHERS IT'S VERY INFORMATIVE ABOUT REFUGEES AND TH YOU KNOW KIND OF THE THINGS THAT THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH AND THEN IT'S REALLY HOPEFUL
POD1000000045_S0000294	SIT'S MIDDLE GRADE AND YOU HAVE TO BE HOPEFUL IN MIDDLE GRADE SO I LOVED IT THE ILLUSTRATIONS AR AND THE STORY ARE JUST SO COMPELLING I SAT DOWN AND READ THE ENTIRE THING AND IT WAS SO GOOD
POD1000000045_S0000295	SOUNDS FANTASTIC I LOVE IT I LOVE
POD1000000045_S0000296	OK BUT IF GRAPHIC NOVELS AREN'T YOUR THING SOMETHING THAT I LOVE TO DO WHEN I'M FEELING A LITTLE BIT LIKE OH DI' WANT TO READ I PICK UP A WY A FANTASY BECAUSE WYA FANTASIES ARE SO FUN AND THEY USUALLY HAVE A SERIES TO GO WITH THEM AND YOU CAN READ LIKE FIVE IN A ROW
POD1000000045_S0000297	TIS ONE ONLY HAS TWO AND IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A FANTASY BUT IT'S AN ALTERNATE HISTORY SO THE FIRST ONE IS CALLED DRED NATION AND THE AUTHOR IS JUSTINA IRELAND
POD1000000045_S0000298	SO THE ALTERNATE HISTORY IS THAT THE CIVIL WAR HAD TO PAUSE BECAUSE ZOMBIES YES ZOMBIES WERE TAKING OVER
POD1000000045_S0000299	AND SO THEY TOOK ALL THESE FORMER SLAVES AND CHILDREN AND PUT THEM IN THESE TRAINING SCHOOLS TO BASICALLY KILL THE ZOMBIES THAT'S THEIR NEW JOB
POD1000000045_S0000300	SO WE HAVE JANE MCKN IS OUR MAIN CHARACTER SHE IS SNARKY AND SPICY AND STRONG SHE'S JUST LIKE ONE OF THOSE CHARACTERS YOU WANT TO BE FRIENDS WITH ECAUSE SHE'S GREAT
POD1000000045_S0000301	SHE AND OTHERS FROM HER TRAINING SCHOOL GET SENT TO THIS SETTLEMENT OUT WEST AND IT'S KIND OF LIKE A CREEPY LIKE SITUATION THEY GET THERE AND THEY'RE LIKE YAH THINGS ARE NOT ALL AS THEY SEEM HERE
POD1000000045_S0000302	AND SO THE ADVENTURE KIND OF TAKES OFF FROM THERE NOW IF YOU HAD ASKED ME BEFORE READING THIS IF I LIKED ZOMBIE BOOKS I WOULD HAVE SAID NO
POD1000000045_S0000303	BUT I LISTEN TO THIS ONE ON AUDIO AND BONNY TURPIN READS IT AND SHE'S LIKE THE QUEEN OF AUDIO BOOKS IN MY OPINION I LOVE HER

POD1000000045_S0000312	I DON'T THINK ENOUGH PEOPLE PUT ENOUGH EMPHASIS IN THEIR LIVES ON THE FACT THAT YOU CAN TOTALLY READ BOOKS VIA AUDIO THAT'S A VERY LEGITIMATE WAY TO READ SO

POD1000000045_S0000345	OKAY KATIE TWENTY TWENTY IT'S BEEN A ROUGH YEAR BUT YOU HAD A BIG LIFE MOMENT HAPPEN WHEN YOU PUBLISHED YOUR FIRST BOOK IT'S CALLED MY STORIED YEAR
POD1000000045_S0000346	SO LET'S SEE WHERE SHOULD WE EVEN START I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR KIND OF WHERE DID THE STORY COME TOYOU FIRST OF ALL GIVE US A LITTLE SNAPSHOT OF WHAT MY STORY YEAR IS ABOUT
POD1000000045_S0000347	AND THEN MAYBE TELL US THE STORY OF HOW DID THIS STORY COME INTO YOUR LIFE INTO YOUR MIND WALK US THROUGH A LITTLE BIT OF HOW THE PROCESS WAS FROM TAKING IT FROM LIKE OH I HAVE THIS IDEA TO NOW YOU CAN HOLD IT IN YOUR HANDS YOU WROTE A BOOK YOU'RE AN AUTHOR TELL US EVERYTHING
POD1000000045_S0000348	OKAY SO MY STORY YOURS STARTS WITH DRAGON STUART HE'S A SEVENTH GRADER AND HE IS DYSLEXIC AND HE HAS A REALLY HARD LIFE AT HOME AND HE'S GOT SOME BULLYING SITUATIONS GOING ON AT SCHOOL
POD1000000045_S0000349	BUT THIS YEAR HE HAS A NEW SET OF TEACHERS AND SOME NEW KIDS IN HIS CLASS AND HIS ENGLISH TEACHER WHO IS MY FAVORITE REALLY KIND OF PULLS OUT THE RIDER IN HIM HE'S LIKE A SECRET POET HE HAS THIS JOURNAL THAT HE CARRIES AROUND AND WRITES POETRY
POD1000000045_S0000350	BUT OTHERWISE DOESN'T REALLY LIKE TO READ OR WRITE BECAUSE IT'S HARD FOR HIM AND HE HAS KIND OF THIS SECRET STORY THAT HE DOESN'T REALLY KNOW IF HE SHOULD TELL IT OR HOW HE SHOULD TELL IT AND SO
POD1000000045_S0000351	THROUGH THE YEAR HE KIND OF OPENS UP TO HIS FRIENDS MORE AND THEN HE'S ABLE TO KIND OF REVEAL HIS STORY AND SO THAT'S THE BASIC PREMISE OF IT
POD1000000045_S0000352	OH MY GOODNESS YOU HAVE SENT A COPY IT'S ON THE WAY TO ME I CANNOT WAIT AGAIN I LOVE LOVE LOVE A MIDDLE GRADE NOVEL AND THIS JUST FEELS SO HEARTWARMING ALREADY JUST HEARING YOU SET UP THE STORY
POD1000000045_S0000353	YOU'VE MENTIONED THAT YOU TAUGHT ELEMENTARY WAS THAT KIND OF A JUMPING OFF POINT FOR YOU IN TERMS OF HOW THIS CHARACTER CAME INTO YOUR MIND
POD1000000045_S0000355	SO WHEN I TAUGHT WRITING WAS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE THING TO TEACH I DID A LOT OF EXTENSIVE TRAINING ON WRITING AND A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT SHE DOES IN THE BOOK THERE'S KIND OF LIKE LITTLE WRITING LESSONS ALONG THE WAY THAT YOU COULD DO WITH YOUR KIDS IF YOU WERE HOMESCHOOLING THEM OR EVEN TEACHERS IN A CLASSROOM
POD1000000045_S0000356	BUT A LOT OF THOSE THINGS I LEARNED THOUGH MY TRAININGS AND SO I WANTED TO PULL IN LIKE THE WHOLE WRITING IS THERAPY ALMOST FOR PEOPLE YOU KNOW HOW WE PUT THINGS INTO WORDS AND HOW OUR CREATIVITY KIND OF FIND OUT WHO WE ARE AND SO
POD1000000045_S0000357	I WANTED TO PULL IN THAT ASPECT OF IT AND DRAGON IS REALLY KIND OF A MIXTURE OF A LOT OF KIDS THAT I TAUGHT YOU KNOW I HAD SOME HARD KIDS IF YOU'RE GON NA TEACH FOR ANY AMOUNT OF TIME YOU'RE GOINNA HAVE SOME KIDS WITH SOME HARD LIVES AND SO
POD1000000045_S0000358	HE'S A MIXTURE OF A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT ONES AND I JUST AT THE BEGINNING OF MY TEACHING I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THESE KIDS BECAUSE THAT WASN'T MY LIFE EXPERIENCE I GREW UP IN A TWO PARENT HOUSEHOLD AND
POD1000000045_S0000359	YOU KNOW WE WERE ALWAYS FINANCIALLY STABLE AND SO I DIDN'T STRUGGLE LIKE THAT AND SO WHEN I MET THESE KIDS IT WAS ALMOST LIKE I CAN'T BELIEVE PEOPLE LIKE THIS EXIST YOU KNOW I DIDN'T HAVE THAT CONTEXT AND SO
POD1000000045_S0000360	I LEARNED OVER THE COURSE OF MY YEARS HOW TO HELP YOU KNOW THESE KIDS GET THROUGH THEIR DAILY LIVES AND HOW TO DO THINGS TO HELP THEM AND I WISH I HAD DONE MORE LOOKING BACK YOU KNOW YOU ALWAYS H SH
POD1000000045_S0000362	
POD1000000045_S0000363	BUT DRAGON IS JUST A MIXTURE OF ALL THOSE KIDS SO I WANTED KIDS TO BE ABLE TO SEE THAT KIDS LIKE THIS ARE REAL AND THAT THEY DO HAVE REAL PROBLEMS AND HOW YOU KNOW
POD1000000045_S0000364	THEY NEED SUPPORT AT SCHOOL FROM THEIR FRIENDS FROM THEIR TEACHERS I WANTED TO WRITE IT FOR TEACHERS TO SEE HOW YOU KNOW THEY CAN BE SO IMPORTANT IN THESE KIDS' LIVES ESPECIALLY IF THEIR HOME LIFE IS NOT STABLE
POD1000000045_S0000365	KNOW THEIR TEACHER MIGHT BE THEIR ONE ADULT THAT LOVES THEM AND SO I WANTED TO PUT THAT IN THE BOOK TO
POD1000000045_S0000366	YES YEAH THAT IS SO TRUE I MEAN TEACHERS CAN HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON OUR LIVES SOMETIMES NOT EVEN IN GOOD WAY BUT DEFINITELY IN POSITIVE WAYS
POD1000000045_S0000367	AND I THINK THAT CAN HAPPEN AT ANY POINT ALONG OUR JOURNEY BUT I THINK THOSE MIDDLE GRADE YEARS ARE SO TENDER AND SO FORMATIVE AND
POD1000000045_S0000368	WHEN YOU HAVE A TEACHER IN YOUR LIFE THAT REALLY SEES YOU AND IS REALLY ABLE TO HELP YOU TO DISCOVER WHO YOU ARE THAT IS ABSOLUTELY AN ACTUAL LIFE CHANGER SO
POD1000000045_S0000369	YEAH WHAT A GREAT CONTEXT TO SET THE STORY IN AS YOU HAVE THIS IDEA AND SO IT'S OBVIOUSLY GOING TO BE FICTION IN THE FICTION WRITING PROCESS AND MAYBE THIS EVEN DIFFERS DEPENDING ON IF YOU'RE WRITING CHILDREN'S OR MIDDLE GRADE OR IY A OR ADULT
POD1000000045_S0000370	DO YOU FULLY WRITE THE BOOK AND THEN START TO GO TO AGENTS OR PUBLISHERS AND SAY OKAY I HAVE THIS THING OR DO YOU TALK ON THE PUBLISHING IND FIRST AND THEN GO AND WRITE LIKE WHAT WAS THAT PROCESS LIKE FOR YOU
POD1000000045_S0000371	SO IT'S DIFFERENT FOR FICTION AND NONFICTION WHICH I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW UNTIL I HAD KIND OF GONE THROUGH IT BUT WHAT HAPPENED WAS I WROTE AND IT WASN'T EVEN THIS BOOK THAT I WROTE I WROTE ANOTHER MANUSCRIPT
POD1000000045_S0000372	THERE'S A HUGE WRITING CONFERENCE IN DALLAS FORTWORTH CALLED DFW CON AND IT'S A BIG WRITING CONFERENCE AND
POD1000000045_S0000373	WITH YOUR CONFERENCE TICKET YOU GET TEN MINUTES WITH A LITERARY AGENT TO PITCH YOUR WORK AT THAT POINT I HAD A FINISHED MANUSCRIPT AND WHEN I WAS KIND OF RESEARCHING THE CONFERENCE FOR FICTION THEY WANT YOU TO HAVE A COMPLETE MANUSCRIPT
POD1000000045_S0000374	BEFORE YOU EVER CONTACT ANYBODY FOR NONFICTION IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN SELL THE BOOK BEFORE YOU GO LIKE WRITE ALL OF IT THEY SEE IF YOU HAVE A PLATFORM AND YOU WRITE A PROPOSAL AND ALL THAT STUFF BUT THE BOOK DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE DONE
POD1000000045_S0000375	FOR FICTION GENERALLY THEY WANT YOU TO HAVE A COMPLETE MANUSCRIPT BEFORE YOU START PITCHING IT TO ANYBODY SO I SAT DOWN WITH THIS AGENT I KIND OF GAVE HER MY ELEVATOR PITCH ABOUT THE BOOK
POD1000000045_S0000376	AND THEN SHE ASKED ME TO SEND HER THE FULL MANUSCRIPT WHICH IS KIND OF THE BEST THING THAT YOU CAN HEAR AT A CONFERENCE BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE WILL SAY I'LL PASS ON THIS OR SEND ME FIVE PAGES OR WHATEVER SHE ASKED FOR THE FULL THING
POD1000000045_S0000377	SO I SENT IT TO HER AND THEN YOU KNOW SIX EIGHT TEN MONTHS LATER SHE GOT I MEAN IT'S A LONG WAITING PROCESS
POD1000000045_S0000378	BECAUSE THEY HAVE SO MANY MANUSCRIPTS THAT ARE COMING INTO THEM AND THEY HAVE TO READ THEM AND THIS WOMAN ACTUALLY ENDED UP BEING MY AGENT AND I'M SO GRATEFUL FOR HER BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T JUST SEND BACK LIKE I DON'T WANT THIS
POD1000000045_S0000379	SHE SENT BACK A LIST OF REALLY HELPFUL NOTES FOR REVISIONS AND SHE SAID IF YOU WANT TO LIKE REVISE AND THEN RESUBMIT I'LL BE HAPPY TO LOOK AT IT AGAIN SHE WAS LIKE I DON'T THINK WE CAN SELL IT AS IT IS RIGHT NOW BUT I'LL BE HAPPY TO LOOK AT IT AGAIN
POD1000000045_S0000380	SO I TOOK HER NOTES DID A LOT OF THINGS WORKED WITH THE PROFESSIONAL EDITOR AND THEN SENT IT BACK TO HER AND THEN SHE AGREED TO REPRESENT ME SO THAT'S KIND OF HOW THAT SITUATION WENT BUT THAT WAS LIKE A YEAR LONG PROCESS PROBABLY FROM START TO FINISH
POD1000000045_S0000381	AND THEN ONCE SHE HAS IT I STILL WENT BACK AND REWROTE IT PROBABLY TWO OR THREE TIMES NOT A MAJOR REHAUL BUT JUST LIKE THESE PARTS NEED TO BE FIXED
POD1000000045_S0000382	AND THEN SHE STARTED TO SHOP IT TO PUBLISHERS SO SHE DID THE SAME THING I DID TO FIND AN AGENT SHE HAD TO SEND OUT YOU KNOW LETTERS AND SAMPLES AND ALL THAT STUFF TO DIFFERENT PUBLISHERS UNTIL WE FOUND ONE
POD1000000045_S0000383	MY PUBLISHING JOURNEY'S KIND OF LIKE WACKY BECAUSE MY PUBLISHER BOUGHT THE FIRST BOOK THAT I WROTE BUT THEN THEY SAID WHAT ELSE DOES SHE HAVE SO WE SENT HER MY STORY YEAR
POD1000000045_S0000384	AND THEN THEY WERE LIKE WE WANT TO PUBLISH THIS ONE FIRST THEY FELT LIKE IT WAS REALLY TIMELY AND THEY WANTED TO GET IT OUT THERE
POD1000000045_S0000386	FIRST AND THEN THE FIRST BOOK THAT I SOLD WILL ACTUALLY COME OUT IN JUNE SO THAT'S LIKE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT BOOK BUT THEY WANTED TO GET THIS ONE OU
POD1000000045_S0000387	IS IT A MIDDLE GRADE NOVEL TOO
POD1000000045_S0000388	IT'S ALSO MIDDLE GRADE AND IT'S HISTORICAL FICTION SO IT'S TOTALLY LIKE ON A DIFFERENT LEVEL THAN THIS ONE BUT E
POD1000000045_S0000389	THAT IS FASCINATING I MEAN YOU SAY THAT THE TIMELINE WAS A LITTLE WACKY BIT IF I'VE LEARNED ANYTHING FROM MY FRIENDS WHO ARE AUTHORS IT'S THAT LIKE THE TIMELINE'S ALWAYS CRAZY LIKE EVERYTHING TAKES SO LONG
POD1000000045_S0000390	AND THEN SOMETIMES YOU WRITE THE LIKE I'VE HAD FRIENDS WHO ARE NONFICTION AUTHORS WHO WRITE THE WHOLE THING SUBMIT IT AND THEN THE PUBLISHER IS LIKE YEAH NO WE DON'T WANT TO DO THIS AFTER ALL IKI MEAN THERE'S ALWAYS LIKE SO MANY TWISTS AND TURNS ON THE PUBLISHING JOURNEY
POD1000000045_S0000391	SO I CAN ONLY IMAGINE YEAH THAT EVERY SINGLE ONE I'M SURE HAS SURPRISES ALONG THE WAY SOME MAYBE ARE NOT SO HAPPY SURPRISES BUT WHAT HAS SURPRISED YOU IN A WAY THAT YOU REALLY LIKE THIS WAS A HAPPY SURPRISE ABOUT THE PUBLISHING PROCESS
POD1000000045_S0000392	THE THING THAT SURPRISED ME THE MOST AT WASN'T REALLY HAPPY WAS HOW LONG IT TOOK BECAUSE YOU KNOW LIKE I'M LIKE I WROTE THIS BOOK AND LET'S GET IT OUT I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW LONG OF A PROCESS IT IS FROM LIKE GETTING IT FROM A RAW DRAFT TO AN ACTUAL BOOK
POD1000000045_S0000393	BUT I THINK THE THING THAT SURPRISED ME IN THE BEST WAY IS THAT I HAVE JUST MET SO MANY GOOD PEOPLE THAT LIKE MY EDITOR IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE PEOPLE SHE IS GRACIOUS BUT SHE'S TOUGH AND SHE'S YOU KNOW CUT THIS YOU KNOW
POD1000000045_S0000394	LET'S FIX THIS PART BECAUSE IT'S NOT QUITE WORKING AND I'VE JUST LEARNED A LOT ABOUT MYSELF AS A WRITER AND ABOUT GOOD WRITING AND SO THAT'S BEEN REALLY REALLY GOOD
POD1000000045_S0000395	I ALSO WANT TO ENCOURAGE ANYBODY WHO'S WRITING TO FIND YOURSELF A WRITING GROUP AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SOMEONE YOU MEET WITH LIKE MY WRITING GROUP I FOUND FROM SORDA AWESOME WE'RE IN THE SORDA AWESOME RIDERS
POD1000000045_S0000396	SPIN OFF GROUP AND SOMEONE WAS BRAVE ENOUGH AND JUST SAID HEY WHO WANTS TO BE IN A WRITING GROUP AND SO WE'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE LIKE I'M IN TEXAS AND THERE'S ONE IN NEW YORK AND ONE IN LEBANON AND ONE IN YOU KNOW CONNECTICUT

YOU1000000001_S0000069	SO THANKS AGAIN FOR WATCHING PITZARV AND HAPPY CAMPING
YOU1000000003_S0000001	THIS IS A THREE IT'S SLOPPILY WRITTEN AND RENDERED AT AN EXTREMELY LOW RESOLUTION OF TWENTY EIGHT BY TWENTY EIGHT PIXELS
YOU1000000003_S0000002	BUT YOUR BRAIN HAS NO TROUBLE RECOGNIZING IT AS A THREE
YOU1000000003_S0000003	AND I WANT YOU TO TAKE A MOMENT TO APPRECIATE HOW CRAZY IT IS THAT BRAINS CAN DO THIS SO EFFORTLESSLY
YOU1000000003_S0000004	I MEAN THIS THIS AND THIS ARE ALSO RECOGNIZABLE AS THREES
YOU1000000003_S0000005	EVEN THOUGH THE SPECIFIC VALUES OF EACH PIXEL IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM ONE IMAGE TO THE NEXT
YOU1000000003_S0000006	THE PARTICULAR LIGHT SENSITIVE CELLS IN YOUR EYE THAT ARE FIRING WHEN YOU SEE THIS THREE ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE ONES FIRING WHEN YOU SEE THIS THREE
YOU1000000003_S0000007	BUT SOMETHING IN THAT CRAZY SMART VISUAL CORTEX OF YOURS RESOLVES THESE AS REPRESENTING THE SAME IDEA
YOU1000000003_S0000008	WHILE AT THE SAME TIME RECOGNIZING OTHER IMAGES AS THEIR OWN DISTINCT IDEAS
YOU1000000003_S0000009	BUT IF I TOLD YOU HEY SIT DOWN AND WRITE FOR ME A PROGRAM THAT TAKES IN A GRID OF TWENTY EIGHT BY TWENTY EIGHT PIXELS LIKE THIS
YOU1000000003_S0000010	AND OUTPUTS A SINGLE NUMBER BETWEEN ZERO AND TEN TELLING YOU WHAT IT THINKS THE DIGIT IS
YOU1000000003_S0000011	WELL THE TASK GOES FROM COMICALLY TRIVIAL TO DAUNTINGLY DIFFICULT
YOU1000000003_S0000012	UNLESS YOU'VE BEEN LIVING UNDER A ROCK I THINK I HARDLY NEED TO MOTIVATE THE RELEVANCE AND IMPORTANCE OF MACHINE LEARNING AND NEURAL NETWORKS
YOU1000000003_S0000013	THE PRESENT AND TO THE FUTURE BUT WHAT I WANT TO DO HERE IS SHOW YOU WHAT A NEURAL NETWORK ACTUALLY IS
YOU1000000003_S0000014	ASSUMING NO BACKGROUND AND TO HELP VISUALIZE WHAT IT'S DOING NOT AS A BUZZWORD BUT AS A PIECE OF MATH
YOU1000000003_S0000015	MY HOPE IS JUST THAT YOU COME AWAY FEELING LIKE THE STRUCTURE ITSELF IS MOTIVATED
YOU1000000003_S0000016	AND TO FEEL LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS WHEN YOU READ OR YOU HEAR ABOUT A NEURAL NETWORK QUOTE UNQUOTE LEARNING
YOU1000000003_S0000017	THIS VIDEO IS JUST GOING TO BE DEVOTED TO THE STRUCTURE COMPONENT OF THAT AND THE FOLLOWING ONE IS GONG TO TACKLE LEARNING
YOU1000000003_S0000018	WHAT WE'RE GONG TO DO IS PUT TOGETHER A NEURAL NETWORK THAT CAN LEARN TO RECOGNIZE HANDWRITTEN DIGITS
YOU1000000003_S0000020	THIS IS A SOMEWHAT CLASSIC EXAMPLE FOR INTRODUCING THE TOPIC
YOU1000000003_S0000021	AND I'M HAPPY TO STICK WITH THE STATUS QUO HERE BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE TWO VIDEOS I WANT TO POINT YOU TO A COUPLE GOOD RESOURCES WHERE YOU CAN LEARN MORE
YOU1000000003_S0000022	AND WHERE YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THE CODE THAT DOES THIS AND PLAY WITH IT ON YOUR OWN COMPUTER
YOU1000000003_S0000024	THERE ARE MANY MANY VARIANTS OF NEURAL NETWORKS AND IN RECENT YEARS THERE'S BEEN SORT OF A BOOM IN RESEARCH TOWARDS THESE VARIANTS
YOU1000000003_S0000025	BUT IN THESE TWO INTRODUCTORY VIDEOS YOU AND I ARE JUST GOING TO LOOK AT THE SIMPLEST PLAIN VANILLA FORM WITH NO ADDED FRILLS
YOU1000000003_S0000026	THIS IS KIND OF A NECESSARY PREREQUISITE FOR UNDERSTANDING ANY OF THE MORE POWERFUL MODERN VARIANTS
YOU1000000003_S0000027	AND TRUST ME IT STILL HAS PLENTY OF COMPLEXITY FOR US TO WRAP OUR MINDS AROUND
YOU1000000003_S0000028	BUT EVEN IN THIS SIMPLEST FORM IT CAN LEARN TO RECOGNIZE HAND WRITTEN DIDGITS
YOU1000000003_S0000029	WHICH IS A PRETTY COOL THING FOR A COMPUTER TO BE ABLE TO DO
YOU1000000003_S0000031	AT THE SAME TIME YOU'LL SEE HOW IT DOES FALL SHORT OF A COUPLE HOPES THAT WE MIGHT HAVE FOR
YOU1000000003_S0000033	AS THE NAME SUGGESTS NEURAL NETWORKS ARE INSPIRED BY THE BRAIN BUT LET'S BREAK THAT DOWN WHAT ARE THE NEURONS AND IN WHAT SENSE ARE THEY LINKED TOGETHER
YOU1000000003_S0000034	RIGHT NOW WHEN I SAY NEURON ALL I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT IS A THING THAT HOLDS A NUMBER SPECIFICALLY A NUMBER BETWEEN ZERO AND ONE IT'S REALLY NOT MORE THAN THAT
YOU1000000003_S0000036	OR EXAMPLE THE NETWORK STARTS WITH A BUNCH OF NEURONS CORRESPONDING TO EACH OF THE TWENTY EIGHT TIMES TWENTY EIGHT PIXELS OF THE INPUT IMAGE
YOU1000000003_S0000037	WHICH IS SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR NEURONS IN TOTAL EACH ONE OF THESE HOLDS A NUMBER THAT REPRESENTS THE GRAY SCALE VALUE OF THE CORRESPONDING PIXEL
YOU1000000003_S0000038	RANGING FROM ZERO FOR BLACK PIXELS UP TO ONE FOR WHITE PIXELS THIS NUMBER INSIDE THE NEURON IS CALLED ITS ACTIVATION
YOU1000000003_S0000039	AND THE IMAGE YOU MIGHT HAVE IN MIND HERE IS THAT EACH NEURON IS LIT UP WHEN ITS ACTIVATION IS A HIGH NUMBER
YOU1000000003_S0000041	ALL OF THESE SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR NEURONS MAKE UP THE FIRST LAYER OF OUR NETWORK
YOU1000000003_S0000043	OW JUMPING OVER TO THE LAST LAYER THIS HAS TEN NEURONS EACH REPRESENTING ONE OF THE DIGITS
YOU1000000003_S0000044	THE ACTIVATION IN THESE NEURONS AGAIN SOME NUMBER THAT'S BETWEEN ZERO AND ONE
YOU1000000003_S0000045	REPRESENTS HOW MUCH THE SYSTEM THINKS THAT A GIVEN IMAGE CORRESPONDS WITH A GIVEN DIGIT
YOU1000000003_S0000046	THERE'S ALSO A COUPLE LAYERS IN BETWEEN CALLED THE HIDDEN LAYERS WHICH FOR THE TIME BEING SHOULD JUST BE A GIANT QUESTION MARK
YOU1000000003_S0000047	FOR HOW ON EARTH THIS PROCESS OF RECOGNIZING DIGITS IS GOING TO BE HANDLED IN THIS NETWORK I CHOSE TWO HIDDEN LAYERS EACH ONE WITH SIXTEEN NEURONS
YOU1000000003_S0000048	AND ADMITTEDLY THAT'S KIND OF AN ARBITRARY CHOICE TO BE HONEST I CHOSE TWO LAYERS BASED ON HOW I WANT TO MOTIVATE THE STRUCTURE IN JUST A MOMENT
YOU1000000003_S0000049	AND SIXTEEN WELL THAT WAS JUST A NICE NUMBER TO FIT ON THE SCREEN IN PRACTICE THERE IS A LOT OF ROOM FOR EXPERIMENT WITH A SPECIFIC STRUCTURE HERE
YOU1000000003_S0000050	THE WAY THE NETWORK OPERATES ACTIVATIONS IN ONE LAYER DETERMINE THE ACTIVATIONS OF THE NEXT LAYER
YOU1000000003_S0000051	AND OF COURSE THE HEART OF THE NETWORK AS AN INFORMATION PROCESSING MECHANISM COMES DOWN TO EXACTLY HOW THOSE ACTIVATIONS FROM ONE LAYR BRING ABOUT ACTIVATIONS IN THE NEXT LAYER
YOU1000000003_S0000052	IT'S MEANT TO BE LOOSELY ANALOGOUS TO HOW IN BIOLOGICAL NETWORKS OF NEURONS SOME GROUPS OF NEURONS FIRING CAUSE CERTAIN OTHERS TO FIRE
YOU1000000003_S0000053	NOW THE NETWORK I'M SHOWING HERE HAS ALREADY BEEN TRAINED TO RECOGNIZE DIGITS AND LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN BY THAT
YOU1000000003_S0000054	MEANS IF YOU FEED IN AN IMAGE LIGHTING UP ALL SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR NEURONS OF THE INPUT LAYER ACCORDING TO THE BRIGHTNESS OF EACH PIXEL IN THE IMAGE
YOU1000000003_S0000055	THAT PATTERN OF ACTIVATIONS CAUSES SOME VERY SPECIFIC PATTERN IN THE NEXT LAYER WHICH CAUSES SOME PATTERN IN THE ONE AFTER IT
YOU1000000003_S0000056	WHICH FINALLY GIVES SOME PATTERN IN THE OUTPUT LAYER AND THE BRIGHTEST NEURON OF THAT OUTPUT LAYER IS THE NETWORK'S CHOICE SO TO SPEAK FOR WHAT DIGIT THIS IMAGE REPRESENTS
YOU1000000003_S0000058	AND BEFORE JUMPING INTO THE MATH FOR HOW ONE LAYER INFLUENCES THE NEXT OR HOW TRAINING WORKS
YOU1000000003_S0000059	LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT WHY IT'S EVEN REASONABLE TO EXPECT A LAYERED STRUCTURE LIKE THIS TO BEHAVE INTELLIGENTLY
YOU1000000003_S0000060	WHAT ARE WE EXPECTING HERE WHAT IS THE BEST HOPE FOR WHAT THOSE MIDDLE LAYERS MIGHT BE DOING
YOU1000000003_S0000061	WELL WHEN YOU OR I RECOGNIZE DIGITS WE PIECE TOGETHER VARIOUS COMPONENTS A NINE HAS A LOOP UPTOP AND A LINE ON THE RIGHT
YOU1000000003_S0000062	AN EIGHT ALSO HAS A LOOP UP TOP BUT IT'S PAIRED WITH ANOTHER LOOP DOWN LOW
YOU1000000003_S0000063	A FOUR BASICALLY BREAKS DOWN INTO THREE SPECIFIC LINES AND THINGS LIKE THAT
YOU1000000003_S0000064	NOW IN A PERFECT WORLD WE MIGHT HOPE THAT EACH NEURON IN THE SECOND TO LAST LAYER CORRESPONDS WITH ONE OF THESE SUBCOMPONENTS
YOU1000000003_S0000065	THAT ANYTIME YOU FEED IN AN IMAGE WITH SAY A LOOP UP TOP LIKE A NINE OR AN EIGHT THERE'S SOME SPECIFIC NEURON WHOSE ACTIVATION IS GOING TO BE CLOSE TO ONE
YOU1000000003_S0000066	AND I DON'T MEAN THIS SPECIFIC LOOP OF PIXELS THE HOPE WOULD BE THAT ANY GENERALLY LOOPY PATTERN TOWARDS THE TOP SETS OFF THIS NEURON
YOU1000000003_S0000067	THAT WAY GOING FROM THE THIRD LAYER TO THE LAST ONE JUST REQUIRES LEARNING WHICH COMBINATION OF SUBCOMPONENTS CORRESPONDS TO WHICH DIGITS
YOU1000000003_S0000068	OF COURSE THAT JUST KICKS THE PROBLEM DOWN THE ROAD BECAUSE HOW WOULD YOU RECOGNIZE THESE SUBCOMPONENTS OR EVEN LEARN WHAT THE RIGHT SUBCOMPONENTS SHOULD BE
YOU1000000003_S0000069	AND I STILL HAVEN'T EVEN TALKED ABOUT HOW ONE LAYER INFLUENCES THE NEXT BUT RUN WITH ME ON THIS ONE FOR A MOMENT RECOGNIZING A LOOP CAN ALSO BREAK DOWN INTO SUB PROBLEMS
YOU1000000003_S0000070	ONE REASONABLE WAY TO DO THIS WOULD BE TO FIRST RECOGNIZE THE VARIOUS LITTLE EDGES THAT MAKE IT UP
YOU1000000003_S0000071	SIMILARLY A LONG LINE LIKE THE KIND YOU MIGHT SEE IN THE DIGITS ONE OR FOUR OR SEVEN WELL THAT'S REALLY JUST A LONG EDGE OR MAYBE YOU THINK OF IT AS A CERTAIN PATTERN OF SEVERAL SMALLER EDGES
YOU1000000003_S0000072	SO MAYBE OUR HOPE IS THAT EACH NEURON IN THE SECOND LAYER OF THE NETWORK CORRESPONDS WITH THE VARIOUS RELEVANT LITTLE EDGES
YOU1000000003_S0000073	MAYBE WHEN AN IMAGE LIKE THIS ONE COMES IN IT LIGHTS UP ALL OF THE NEURONS ASSOCIATED WITH AROUND EIGHT TO TEN SPECIFIC LITTLE EDGES
YOU1000000003_S0000074	WHICH IN TURN LIGHTS UP THE NEURONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER LOOP AND A LONG VERTICAL LINE AND THOSE LIGHT UP THE NEURON ASSOCIATED WITH THA NINE
YOU1000000003_S0000075	WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS WHAT OUR FINAL NETWORK ACTUALLY DOES IS ANOTHER QUESTION ONE THAT I'LL COME BACK TO ONCE WE SEE HOW TO TRAIN THE NETWORK
YOU1000000003_S0000076	BUT THIS IS A HOPE THAT WE MIGHT HAVE A SORT OF GOAL WITH THE LAYERED STRUCTURE LIKE THIS
YOU1000000003_S0000077	MOREOVER YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW BEING ABLE TO DETECT EDGES AND PATTERNS LIKE THIS WOULD BE REALLY USEFUL FOR OTHER IMAGE RECOGNITION TASKS
YOU1000000003_S0000078	AND EVEN BEYOND IMAGE RECOGNITION THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF INTELLIGENT THINGS YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO THAT BREAK DOWN INTO LAYERS OF ABSTRACTION
YOU1000000003_S0000079	PARSING SPEECH FOR EXAMPLE INVOLVES TAKING RAW AUDIO AND PICKING OUT DISTINCT SOUNDS WHICH COMBINE TO MAKE CERTAIN SYLLABLES
YOU1000000003_S0000080	WHICH COMBINE TO FORM WORDS WHICH COMBINE TO MAKE UP PHRASES AND MORE ABSTRACT THOUGHTS ETCA
YOU1000000003_S0000081	BUT GETTING BACK TO HOW ANY OF THIS ACTUALLY WORKS PICTURE YOURSELF RIGHT NOW DESIGNING HOW EXACTLY THE ACTIVATIONS IN ONE LAYER MIGHT DETERMINE THE ACTIVATIONS IN THE NEXT
YOU1000000003_S0000082	THE GOAL IS TO HAVE SOME MECHANISM THAT COULD CONCEIVABLY COMBINE PIXELS INTO EDGES OR EDGES INTO PATTERNS OR PATTERNS INTO DIGITS
YOU1000000003_S0000083	AND TO ZOOM IN ON ONE VERY SPECIFIC EXAMPLE LET'S SAY THE HOPE IS FOR ONE PARTICULAR NEURON IN THE SECOND LAYER
YOU1000000003_S0000084	TO PICK UP ON WHETHER OR NOT THE IMAGE HAS AN EDGE IN THIS REGION HERE
YOU1000000003_S0000085	THE QUESTION AT HAND IS WHAT PARAMETERS SHOULD THE NETWORK HAVE WHAT DIALS AND KNOBS SHOULD YOU BE ABLE TO TWEAK
YOU1000000003_S0000086	SO THAT IT'S EXPRESSIVE ENOUGH TO POTENTIALLY CAPTURE THIS PATTERN OR ANY OTHER PIXEL PATTERN OR THE PATTERN THAT SEVERAL EDGES CAN MAKE A LOOP AND OTHER SUCH THINGS
YOU1000000003_S0000087	WHELL WHAT WE'LL DO IS ASSIGN A WEIGHT TO EACH ONE OF THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN OUR NEURON AND THE NEURONS FROM THE FIRST LAYER
YOU1000000003_S0000088	THESE WEIGHTS ARE JUST NUMBERS THEN TAKE ALL OF THOSE ACTIVATIONS FROM THE FIRST LAYER AND COMPUTE THEIR WEIGHTED SUM ACCORDING TO THESE WEIGHTS
YOU1000000003_S0000090	I FIND IT HELPFUL TO THINK OF THESE WEIGHTS AS BEING ORGANIZED INTO A LITTLE GRID OF THEIR OWN AND I'M GOING TO USE GREEN PIXELS TO INDICATE POSITIVE WEIGHTS AND RED PIXELS TO INDICATE NEGATIVE WEIGHTS
YOU1000000003_S0000091	WHERE THE BRIGHTNESS OF THAT PIXEL IS SOME LOOSE DEPICTION OF THE WEIGHT'S VALUE
YOU1000000003_S0000092	NOW IF WE MADE THE WEIGHTS ASSOCIATED WITH ALMOST ALL OF THE PIXELS ZERO EXCEPT FOR SOME POSITIVE WEIGHTS IN THIS REGION THAT WE CARE ABOUT
YOU1000000003_S0000093	THEN TAKING THE WEIGHTED SUM OF ALL THE PIXEL VALUES REALLY JUST AMOUNTS TO ADDING UP THE VALUES OF THE PIXEL JUST IN THE REGION THAT WE CARE ABOUT
YOU1000000003_S0000095	AND IF YOU REALLY WANTED TO PICK UP ON WHETHER THERE'S AN EDGE HERE WHAT YOU MIGHT DO IS HAVE SOME NEGATIVE WEIGHTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SURROUNDING PIXELS
YOU1000000003_S0000096	THEN THE SUM IS LARGEST WHEN THOSE MIDDLE PIXELS ARE BRIGHT BUT THE SURROUNDING PIXELS ARE DARKER
YOU1000000003_S0000098	EN YOU COMPUTE A WEIGHTED SUM LIKE THIS YOU MIGHT COME OUT WITH ANY NUMBER BUT FOR THIS NETWORK WHAT WE WANT IS FOR ACTIVATIONS TO BE SOME VALUE BETWEEN ZERO AND ONE
YOU1000000003_S0000099	SO A COMMON THING TO DO IS TO PUMP THIS WEIGHTED SUM INTO SOME FUNCTION THAT SQUISHES THE REAL NUMBER LINE INTO THE RANGE BETWEEN ZERO AND ONE
YOU1000000003_S0000100	AND A COMMON FUNCTION THAT DOES THIS IS CALLED THE SIGMOID FUNCTION ALSO KNOWN AS A LOGISTIC CURVE
YOU1000000003_S0000101	BASICALLY VERY NEGATIVE INPUTS END UP CLOSE TO ZERO VERY POSITIVE INPUTS END UP CLOSE TO ONE AND IT JUST STEADILY INCREASES AROUND THE INPUT ZERO
YOU1000000003_S0000103	SO THE ACTIVATION OF THE NEURON HERE IS BASICALLY A MEASURE OF HOW POSITIVE THE RELEVANT WEIGHTED SUM IS
YOU1000000003_S0000105	BUT MAYBE IT'S NOT THAT YOU WANT THE NEURON TO LIGHT UP WHEN THE WEIGHTED SUM IS BIGGER THAN ZERO MAYBE YOU ONLY WANT IT TO BE ACTIVE WHEN THE SUM IS BIGGER THAN SAY TEN
YOU1000000003_S0000106	THAT IS YOU WANT SOME BIAS FOR IT TO BE INACTIVE
YOU1000000003_S0000107	WHAT WE'LL DO THEN IS JUST ADD IN SOME OTHER NUMBER LIKE NEGATIVE TEN TO THIS WEIGHTED SUM BEFORE PLUGGING IT THROUGH THE SIGMOID SQUICHIFICATION FUNCTION
YOU1000000003_S0000108	THAT ADDITIONAL NUMBER IS CALLED THE BIAS
YOU1000000003_S0000109	SO THE WEIGHTS TELL YOU WHAT PIXEL PATTERN THIS NEURON IN THE SECOND LAYER IS PICKING UP ON AND THE BIAS TELLS YOU HOW HIGH THE WEIGHTED SUM NEEDS TO BE
YOU1000000003_S0000110	BEFORE THE NEURON STARTS GETTING MEANINGFULLY ACTIVE
YOU1000000003_S0000111	AND THAT IS JUST ONE NEURON EVERY OTHER NEURON IN THIS LAYER IS GOING TO BE CONNECTED TO ALL SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR PIXEL NEURONS FROM THE FIRST LAYER
YOU1000000003_S0000112	AND EACH ONE OF THOSE SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR CONNECTIONS HAS ITS OWN WEIGHT ASSOCIATED WITH IT
YOU1000000003_S0000113	ALSO EACH ONE HAS SOME BIAS SOME OTHER NUMBER THAT YOU ADD ONTO THE WEIGHTED SUM BEFORE SQUISHING IT WITH THE SIGMOID
YOU1000000003_S0000114	AND THAT'S A LOT TO THINK ABOUT
YOU1000000003_S0000115	WITH THIS HIDDEN LAYER OF SIXTEEN NEURONS THAT'S A TOTAL OF SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR TIMES SIXTEEN WEIGHTS ALONG WITH SIXTEEN BIASES
YOU1000000003_S0000116	AND ALL OF THAT IS JUST THE CONNECTIONS FROM THE FIRST LAYER TO THE SECOND THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE OTHER LAYERS ALSO HAVE A BUNCH OF WEIGHTS AND BIASES ASSOCIATED WITH THEM
YOU1000000003_S0000117	ALL SAID AND DONE THIS NETWORK HAS ALMOST EXACTLY THIRTEEN THOUSAND TOTAL WEIGHTS AND BIASES
YOU1000000003_S0000118	THIRTEEN THOUSAND KNOBS AND DIALES THAT CAN BE TWEAKED AND TURNED TO MAKE THIS NETWORK BEHAVE IN DIFFERENT WAYS
YOU1000000003_S0000120	SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT LEARNING WHAT THAT'S REFERRING TO IS GETTING THE COMPUTER TO FIND A VALID SETTING FOR ALL OF THESE MANY MANY NUMBERS SO THAT IT'LL ACTUALLY SOLVE THE PROBLEM AT HAND
YOU1000000003_S0000122	ONE THOUGHT EXPERIMENT THAT IS AT ONCE FUN AND KIND OF HORRIFYING IS TO IMAGINE SITTING DOWN AND SETTING ALL OF THESE WEIGHTS AND BIASES BY HAND
YOU1000000003_S0000123	PURPOSEFULLY TWEAKING THE NUMBERS SO THAT THE SECOND LAYER PICKS UP ON EDGES THE THIRD LAYER PICKS UP ON PATTERNS ETCTA
YOU1000000003_S0000124	I PERSONALLY FIND THIS SATISFYING RATHER THAN JUST TREATING THE NETWORK AS A TOTAL BLACK BOX
YOU1000000003_S0000125	BECAUSE WHEN THE NETWORK DOESN'T PERFORM THE WAY YOU ANTICIPATE
YOU1000000003_S0000126	IF YOU'VE BUILT UP A LITTLE BIT OF A RELATIONSHIP WITH WHAT THOSE WEIGHTS AND BIASES ACTUALLY MEAN YOU HAVE A STARTING PLACE FOR EXPERIMENTING WITH HOW TO CHANGE THE STRUCTURE TO IMPROVE
YOU1000000003_S0000127	OR WHEN THE NETWORK DOES WORK BUT NOT FOR THE REASONS YOU MIGHT EXPECT DIGGING INTO WHAT THE WEIGHTS AND BIASES ARE DOING IS A GOOD WAY TO CHALLENGE YOUR ASSUMPTION
YOU1000000003_S0000128	AND REALLY EXPOSED THE FULL SPACE OF POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS
YOU1000000003_S0000129	BY THE WAY THE ACTUAL FUNCTION HERE IS A LITTLE CUMBERSOME TO WRITE DOWN DON'T YOU THINK
YOU1000000003_S0000131	SO LET ME SHOW YOU A MORE NOTATIONALLY COMPACT WAY THAT THESE CONNECTIONS ARE REPRESENTED THIS IS HOW YOU'D SEE IT IF YOU CHOOSE TO READ UP MORE ABOUT NEURAL NETWORKS
YOU1000000003_S0000132	ORGANIZE ALL OF THE ACTIVATIONS FROM ONE LAYER INTO A COLUMN AS A VECTOR
YOU1000000003_S0000134	THEN ORGANIZE ALL OF THE WEIGHTS AS A MATRIX WHERE EACH ROW OF THAT MATRIX CORRESPONDS TO THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN ONE LAYER AND A PARTICULAR NEURON IN THE NEXT LAYER
YOU1000000003_S0000135	WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT TAKING THE WEIGHTED SUM OF THE ACTIVATIONS IN THE FIRST LAYER ACCORDING TO THESE WEIGHTS
YOU1000000003_S0000136	CORRESPONDS TO ONE OF THE TERMS IN THE MATRIX VECTOR PRODUCT OF EVERYTHING WE HAVE ON THE LEFT HERE
YOU1000000003_S0000138	BY THE WAY SO MUCH OF MACHINE LEARNING JUST COMES DOWN TO HAVING A GOOD GRASP OF LINEAR ALGEBRA
YOU1000000003_S0000139	SO FOR ANY OF YOU WHO WANT A NICE VISUAL UNDERSTANDING FOR MATRIXES AND WHAT MATRIX VECTOR MULTIPLICATION MEANS TAKE A LOOK AT THE SERIES I DID ON LINEAR ALGEBRA ESPECIALLY CHAPTER THREE
YOU1000000003_S0000140	BACK TO OUR EXPRESSION INSTEAD OF TALKING ABOUT ADDING THE BIAS TO EACH ONE OF THESE VALUES INDEPENDENTLY
YOU1000000003_S0000141	WE REPRESENT IT BY ORGANIZING ALL THOSE BIASES INTO A VECTOR AND ADDING THE ENTIRE VECTOR TO THE PREVIOUS MATRIX VECTOR PRODUCT
YOU1000000003_S0000142	THEN AS A FINAL STEP I'LL WRAP A SIGMOID AROUND THE OUTSIDE HERE
YOU1000000003_S0000143	AND WHAT THAT'S SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT IS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO APPLY THE SIGMOID FUNCTION TO EACH SPECIFIC COMPONENT OF THE RESULTING VECTOR INSIDE
YOU1000000003_S0000144	SO ONCE YOU WRITE DOWN THIS WEIGHT MATRIX AND THESE VECTORS AS THEIR OWN SYMBOLS YOU CAN COMMUNICATE THE FULL TRANSITION OF ACTIVATIONS FROM ONE LAYER TO THE NEXT
YOU1000000003_S0000145	IN AN EXTREMELY TIGHT AND NEAT LITTLE EXPRESSION
YOU1000000003_S0000146	AND THIS MAKES THE RELEVANT CODE BOTH A LOT SIMPLER AND A LOT FASTER SINCE MANY LIBRARIES OPTIMIZE THE HECK OUT OF MATRIX MULTIPLICATION
YOU1000000003_S0000148	REMEMBER HOW EARLIER I SAID THESE NEURONS ARE SIMPLY THINGS THAT HOLD NUMBERS WELL OF COURSE THE SPECIFIC NUMBERS THAT THEY HOLD DEPENDS ON THE IMAGE YOU FEED IN
YOU1000000003_S0000150	SO IT'S ACTUALLY MORE ACCURATE TO THINK OF EACH NEURON AS A FUNCTION ONE THAT TAKES IN THE OUTPUTS OF ALL THE NEURONS IN THE PREVIOUS LAYER AND SPITS OUT A NUMBER BETWEEN ZERO AND ONE
YOU1000000003_S0000151	REALLY THE ENTIRE NETWORK IS JUST A FUNCTION ONE THAT TAKES IN SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR NUMBERS AS AN INPUT AND SPITS OUT TEN NUMBERS AS AN OUTPUT
YOU1000000003_S0000152	IT'S AN ABSURDLY COMPLICATED FUNCTION ONE THAT INVOLVES THIRTEEN THOUSAND PARAMETERS IN THE FORMS OF THESE WEIGHTS AND BIASES THAT PICK UP ON CERTAIN PATTERNS
YOU1000000003_S0000153	AND WHICH INVOLVES ITERATING MANY MATRIX VECTOR PRODUCTS AND THE SYGMOID SQUITIFICATION FUNCTION
YOU1000000003_S0000154	BUT IT'S JUST A FUNCTION NONETHELESS AND IN A WAY IT'S KIND OF REASSURING THAT IT LOOKS COMPLICATED
YOU1000000003_S0000155	I MEAN IF IT WERE ANY SIMPLER WHAT HOPE WOULD WE HAVE THAT IT COULD TAKE ON THE CHALLENGE OF RECOGNIZING DIGITS AND HOW DOES IT TAKE ON THAT CHALLENGE
YOU1000000003_S0000156	HOW DOES THIS NETWORK LEARN THE APPROPRIATE WEIGHTS AND BIASES JUST BY LOOKING AT DATA WEL THAT'S WHAT I'LL SHOW IN THE NEXT VIDEO
YOU1000000003_S0000157	AND I'LL ALSO DIG A LITTLE MORE INTO WHAT THIS PARTICULAR NETWORK WE'RE SEEING IS REALLY DOING
YOU1000000003_S0000159	NOW IS THE POINT I SUPPOSE I SHOULD SAY SUBSCRIBE TO STAY NOTIFIED ABOUT WHEN THAT VIDEO OR ANY NEW VIDEOS COME OUT
YOU1000000003_S0000160	BUT REALISTICALLY MOST OF YOU DON'T ACTUALLY RECEIVE NOTIFICATIONS FROM YOUTUBE DO YOU
YOU1000000003_S0000161	MAYBE MORE HONESTLY I SHOULD SAY SUBSCRIBE SO THAT THE NEURAL NETWORKS THAT UNDERLYE YOUTUBE'S RECOMMENDATION ALGORITHM
YOU1000000003_S0000162	ARE PRIMED TO BELIEVE THAT YOU WANT TO SEE CONTENT FROM THIS CHANNEL GET RECOMMENDED TO YOU ANYWAY STAY POSTED FOR MORE
YOU1000000003_S0000163	THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO EVERYONE SUPPORTING THESE VIDEOS ON PATREON
YOU1000000003_S0000164	I'VE BEEN A LITTLE SLOW TO PROGRESS IN THE PROBABILITY SERIES THIS SUMMER BUT I'M JUMPING BACK INTO IT AFTER THIS PROJECT SO PATRONS YOU CAN LOOK OUT FOR UPDATES THERE
YOU1000000003_S0000166	TO CLOSE THINGS OFF HERE I HAVE WITH ME LISHA LEE WHO DID HER PH D WORK ON THE THEORETICAL SIDE OF DEEP LEARNING
YOU1000000003_S0000167	AND WHO CURRENTLY WORKS AT A VENTURE CAPITAL FIRM CALLED AMPLIFY PARTNERS WHO KINDLY PROVIDED SOME OF THE FUNDING FOR THIS VIDEO
YOU1000000003_S0000168	SO LICHA ONE THING I THINK WE SHOULD QUICKLY BRING UP IS THIS SIGMOID FUNCTION
YOU1000000003_S0000169	AS I UNDERSTAND IT EARLY NETWORKS USED THIS TO SQUISH THE RELEVANT WEIGHTED SUM INTO THAT INTERVAL BETWEEN ZERO AND ONE
YOU1000000003_S0000170	YOU KNOW KIND OF MOTIVATED BY THIS BIOLOGICAL ANALOGY OF NEURONS EITHER BEING INACTIVE OR ACTE
YOU1000000003_S0000171	EXACTLY
YOU1000000003_S0000172	BUT RELATIVELY FEW MODERN NETWORKS ACTUALLY USE SIGMOID ANYMORE THAT'S KIND OF OLD SCHOOL IG
YOU1000000003_S0000173	YEAH OR RATHER RELL USE SEEMS TO BE MUCH EASIER TO TRAIN
YOU1000000003_S0000174	AND RELU RELU STANDS FOR RECTIFIED LINEAR UNIT
YOU1000000003_S0000175	YES IT'S THIS KIND OF FUNCTION WHERE YOU'RE JUST TAKING A MAX OF ZERO
YOU1000000003_S0000176	AND A WHERE A IS GIVEN BY WHAT YOU WERE EXPLAINING IN THE VIDEO
YOU1000000003_S0000177	AND WHAT THIS WAS SORT OF MOTIVATED FROM I THINK WAS A PARTIALLY BIBIOLOGICAL ANALOGY WITH HOW NEURONS WOULD EITHER BE ACTIVATED
YOU1000000003_S0000178	OR NOT AND SO IF IT PASSES A CERTAIN THRESHOLD IT WOULD BE THE IDENTITY FUNCTION BUT IF IT DID NOT THEN IT WOULD JUST NOT BE ACTIVATED SOD BE ZERO SO IT'S KIND OF A SIMPLIFICATION
YOU1000000003_S0000179	USING SIGMOIDS DIDN'T HELP TRAINING OR IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO TRAIN TSAT SOME POINT AND PEOPLE JUST TRIED REL YOU
YOU1000000003_S0000180	AND IT HAPPENED TO WORK VERY WELL FOR THESE INCREDIBLY DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS
YOU1000000003_S0000181	ALL RIGHT THANK YOU ELICHA

YOU1000000019_S0000000	HEY GUYS HITS UP IT'S CHIERA CUBA AND IN THIS VIDEO WE'RE GOINGNA BE TALKING ABOUT THE VALK THREE THE FIRST CUBE SINCE TWENTY TEN TO BE NAMED AFTER A SPEED CUBE
YOU1000000019_S0000001	HEVISION FOR THE VOLK THREE WAS BROUGHT ABOUT BY MATTS VALK WHOS THE FORMER THREE BY THREE SINGLE WORLD RECORD HOLDER AND THE THIRD PLACE WINNER OF U S NATIONALS THIS YEAR
YOU1000000019_S0000002	THE CUBE WAS DESIGNED BY CHI MOFANGI AND WAS APPROVED BY MATTS VALK OF COURSE THE CUBE IS HIS MAIN BUT LET'S SEE HOW THE CUBE ACTUALLY PERFORMS AND WHETHER IT'S RIGHT FOR OU
YOU1000000019_S0000004	VALK THRE IS ON THE PRICE YER SIDE OF THINGS IT'S ABOUT TWENTY DOLLARS AND IF YOU OPT FOR THE CUBICALE PREMIUM VERSION LIKE I DID IT'S GONNA BE TWENTY SEVEN DOLLARS
YOU1000000019_S0000005	HE CUBE IN THIS REVIEW WILL BE THE PREMIUM VOLK THREE AND I HAVEN'T CHANGED THE LOOB AT ALL I'VE JUST TIGHTENED THE TENSIONS A LITTLE BIT IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW THE PREMIUM VOLK THREE IS PREPARED THE LINK WILL BE IN THE DESCRIPTION
YOU1000000019_S0000006	YOU WANTTA CHECK THAT OUT ANYWAYS MOVING ON THE VALK THREE MEASURES FIFTY FIVE POINT FIVE MILLIMETERES ACROSS I KIND AF FEEL LIKE THAT WAS PLANNED A LITTLE BIT
YOU1000000019_S0000007	BUT I GUESS WE'LL NEVER KNOW FOR SURE THE STOCKSTICKERS ARE LABELED AS THE CHEE HALFBRIGHT SHADES BUT THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH IDENTICAL TO CUE SMITH HALFBRIGHTS
YOU1000000019_S0000008	WHICH IF YOU GUYS DIDN'T KNOW WERE THE SHADES THAT EVERYONE USED TO USE BEFORE THE CUBICALE STICKERS BECAME POPULAR SO LET'S TALK ABOUT TURNING
YOU1000000019_S0000009	OUT OF THE BOX THE VALK THREE REMINDED ME OF A YUSHIAO A BIT WHEN I OPENED UP THE CUBES TO COMPARE THE MECHANISMS I WAS ACTUALLY VERY SURPRISED TO SEE THAT THEY WERE ALMOST IDENTICAL SEEMINGLY
YOU1000000019_S0000010	EVEN MOYOU POSTED SOME PHOTOS OF THE USCHIA AND THE VALK THREE NEXT TO EACH OTHER AND THE MECHANISMS LOOKED PRETTY MUCH THE SAME
YOU1000000019_S0000011	BUT SHE THEN WENT ON TO POST SOME MORE PHOTOS AND EXPLAINED SOME MORE OF THE SUBTLE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO CUBES
YOU1000000019_S0000012	AND OF COURSE FEELING A BROKEN IN YUSHIAOU AND A BROKEN IN VALQ THREE THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH NOTHING ALIKE THE VAQ THREE IS PRETTY MUCH ENTIRELY SMOOTH THERE ARE NO BUMPS OR ANYTHING ALONG THE TURN
YOU1000000019_S0000013	IT'S JUST COMPLETELY SMOOTH IT'S ALSO VERY LIGHT AND VERY FAST VERY LITTLE EFFORT IS REQUIRED TO START A TURN SO THE CUBE IS BEST SUITED FOR A LIGHT ACCURATE TURNSTYLE
YOU1000000019_S0000014	WHEN TURNING FAST THE CUBE DOES BECOME A BIT CLICKY AND HAS A VERY RIGID FEEL IN GENERAL THE CUBE IS EASY TO CONTROL ON TIGHT TENSIONS BUT SOMETIMES I DO LOSE CONTROL AND OVERSHOOT
YOU1000000019_S0000015	CAUSING A LOCKUP ALTHOUGH THIS MOSTLY HAPPENS WHEN I'M SPAMMING TPS IN THE LAST LAYER SO I'VE HAD TO LEARN TO CONTROL MY SPEED TO HELP WITH OVERSHOOTING
YOU1000000019_S0000016	AND IN GENERAL I'VE JUST HAD TO ADJUST MY TURNING STYLE QUITE A BIT TO DO WELL WITH THIS CUBE SINCE I'VE BEEN USING THE ALONG V TWO AS MY MAIN I WOULD SAY I'VE ADAPTED MORE OF A HARSHER TURN STYLE
YOU1000000019_S0000017	AS THE LLN V TWO IS VERY FORGIVING BUT IT'S ALSO NOT SUPER FAST SO YOU CAN TURN VERY ROUGH AND YOU WON'T LOCK UP BASICALLY
YOU1000000019_S0000018	BUT IF YOU USE THAT TURN STYLE WITH A VOLK IT JUST LOCKS UP COMPLETELY SO I'VE HAD TO WORK ON ADJUSTING MY TURN STYLE TO BE A BIT SLOWER LITTLE BIT MORE PRECISE
YOU1000000019_S0000019	BUT WITH A BIT OF PRACTICE I'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET MY TIMES BACK DOWN TO WHAT THEY USUALLY ARE AND I'VE PRETTY MUCH STOPPED GETTING LOCKUPS THE CORNER CUTTING ON THE VOLK IS UP TO PAR WITH ANY MODERN SPEED CUBE
YOU1000000019_S0000020	ALTHOUGH I DID NOTICE AFTER TIGHTENING THE TENSIONS IT WAS MUCH HARDER TO CUT PAST FORTY FIVE SAME WITH THE REVERSE BUT SMALLER CUTS WERE JUST FINE
YOU1000000019_S0000021	THE UBE HOWEVER JUST FEELS A BIT MORE RIGID AND STIRDY THAN OTHER THREE BY THREES WHICH I REALLY LIKE IT'S A VERY STABLE PUZZLE IT'S JUST NOT AS FORGIVING AS SOME OTHER THREE BY THREES
YOU1000000019_S0000022	POPPING AND CORNER TWISTING OF COURSE NEVER HAPPEND ON THIS CUBE THOSE ARE TWO THINGS THAT REALLY DON'T EVEN NEED TO BE TALKED ABOUT IN REVIEWS ANYMORE BECAUSE PRETTY MUCH ALL CUBES HAVE THOSE TRAITS
YOU1000000019_S0000023	OVERALL THE PERFORMANCE OF THE VOLK THREE IS REALLY REALLY GOOD BUT THERE ARE JUST A FEW THINGS THAT BUG ME ABOUT IT THAT I'M JUST NOT A HUGE FAN OF FIRST OF ALL THE SIZE
YOU1000000019_S0000024	HFIFTY FIVE POINT FIVE MILLIMETERES IS JUST A LITTLE TOO SMALL FOR ME I DO PREFER FIFTY SEVEN MILLIMETR CUBES MAINLY BECAUSE MY HANDS ARE REALLY BIG
YOU1000000019_S0000025	AND I ACTUALLY FOUND MY FINGERS GETTING CAUGHT ON THE LAYERS SOMETIMES ESPECIALLY DOING M TURNS I JUST NOTICED THAT TO HAPPEN IT'S NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL THOUGH
YOU1000000019_S0000026	MBUT IT'S JUST SOMETHING I NOTICED SECOND IS THE COMPLETELY SMOOTH TURNING I PREFER CUBES THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE BUMPY AND A LITTLE SLOWER
YOU1000000019_S0000027	THE CUBE JUST GLIDES SO EFFORTLESSLY IT'S KIND OF HARD TO CONTROL SOMETIMES THIS IS ANOTHER ONE THAT I'VE GOTTEN USED TO OVER TIME AND I'M STARTING TO ACTUALLY ENJOY NOW BUT I STILL THOUGHT I'D BRING IT
YOU1000000019_S0000028	FINALLY THE SQUARED OFF CORNERS NOW I SAY THIS IN EVERY EVIEW I DON'T REALLY LIKE SQUARED OFF CORNERS FOR ME THEY JUST COST TOO MUCH CATCHING AND I DON'T REALLY CORNER TWIST EITHER WAY
YOU1000000019_S0000029	SO IT'S NOT REALLY AN ADVANTAGE FOR ME BUT THIS CUBE IN PARTICULAR I FELT HAS A BIGGER CATCHING ISSUE
YOU1000000019_S0000030	I'M NOT SURE WHY BUT I NOTICE THE CORNER CATCHING ON THE CENTER MORE OFTEN THAN WITH OTHER SQUARED OFF CORNER PUZZLES I JUST THINK THAT IF THE CORNERS WERE ROUNDED OFF ALL OF THE CATCHING PROBLEMS WOULD PRETTY MUCH DISAPPEAR
YOU1000000019_S0000031	ONCE AGAIN I'VE PRETTY MUCH GOTTEN USED TO IT BUT I WOULD STILL PREFER IT IF THEY WEREN'T THERE OVERALL THE VOLK THREE IS AN EXTREMELY SOLID CUBE
YOU1000000019_S0000032	THE PERFORMANCE IS REALLY TOP OF THE LINE AND MY PROBLEMS WITH IT ARE REALLY JUST MORE MINOR ANNOYANCES THE VALK HAS HUGE POTENTIAL IN MY OPINION TO BE ONE OF THE BEST
YOU1000000019_S0000033	IF NOT THE BEST SPEED CUBES YOU CAN BUY AND IT HONESTLY SURPRISES ME THAT I'M SAYING THAT THE SCUBE HAS GOTTEN ME SOME NEW PERSONAL BESTS AND IT'S GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO BEATING MY OULONG
YOU1000000019_S0000034	I CAN'T SAY FOR SURE THAT I'LL MAKE IT MY MAIN AS I STILL DO HAVE SOME MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT IT BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD ABSOLUTELY GIVE THIS CUBE A SHOT IF YOU'VE BEEN ON THE FENCE ABOUT I
YOU1000000019_S0000035	D IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT DEFINITELY GET THE PREMIUM VERSION IT'S SET UP PERFECTLY AND I HAVEN'T HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT BUT ANYWAY THAT'S ALL I'VE GOT TO SAY ABOUT THE CHE MOFANGI VOLK THREE

YOU1000000021_S0000141	ZACH STILL WANTS ANSWERS FOR THE DEAD TOWNSFOLK AND QUESTION IS SEPHRATH'S SANITY BUT SEPARATH HAS NO MORE WORDS FOR ANY HUMAN EVEN IF THEY USED TO BE HIS ALLIES
YOU1000000021_S0000142	FEELING BETRAYED ZACH ATTACKS SEFROTH WHO PARRIES HIM EASILY AND KNOCKS HIM TO THE DEPTHS OF THE REACTOR
YOU1000000021_S0000143	AS THEY CLASH ZACH REMEMBERS WHEN SEFROTH WAS STILL THE IDEAL HERO AND ROLE MODEL TO HIM
YOU1000000021_S0000144	ONCE EXPLAINING THAT MATERIAL WHICH ALLOWS HUMANS TO USE MAGIC IS FORMED FROM CONDENSED MOCO ENERGY FROM THE PLANET AND CONTAINS KNOWLEDGE OF THE ANCIENTS WHO WERE BOUND TO THE PLANET AND HAD THE POWER TO CONTROL IT AT WILL
YOU1000000021_S0000145	ACCUSING SEPHEROTH OF LOSING HIS WAY HE IS COUNTERED BY SEPHROTH WHO CONSIDERS HIMSELF TO BE THE CHOSEN ONE DESPITE BEING ENGINEERED BY HUMANS TO BE A PARAGON ANCIENT TO DO THEIR BIDDING

YOU1000000021_S0000150	ZACH URGES CLOUD TO FINISH OFF AN INJURED SEPHROTH BUT NATURALLY CLOUD IS NOWHERE NEAR SEPHRADH'S LEAGUE IN TERMS OF STRENGTH
YOU1000000021_S0000151	HOWEVER CLOUD MAKES UP FOR IT IN SHEER GUTS AS AFTER SEFHAROTH IMPAILS HIM ON HIS SWORD AND ISUES A WARNING NOT TO MAKE HIM MAD CLOUD INSTEAD USES ALL HIS STRENGTH TO LIFT UP SEFAROVH WHO'S SURPRISED BY THE FEAT AND HURL HIM AWAY

YOU1000000021_S0000156	HOWEVER SHINNER LABELS THEM BOTH FUGITIVE SAMPLES SO THEY FIND THEMSELVES NOW RUNNING FROM THE ARMY AND SISNE ACTUALLY MANAGES TO CATCH UP TO THEM FIRST
YOU1000000021_S0000157	HE PLEADS WITH HER TO JUST WALK AWAY AS HE KNOWS IT'S TALRDER TO ESCAPE THE TURKS BUT SISNA CHOOSES HER DUTY OVER PERSONAL FEELINGS
YOU1000000021_S0000158	HOWEVER ZACKRFUSES TO FIGHT HER SERIOUSLY FOR NOW AND MUST LEAVE HER BEHIND
YOU1000000021_S0000159	STILL SHE FOLLOWS THEM AND EMPATHIZES WITH CLOUD'S SEVERE CASE OF MOCO ADDICTION AND SO HELPS THEM THST ANTS TO ESCAPE WITH THEIR MOTORCYCLE
YOU1000000021_S0000160	HOWEVER GENESIS ISN'T DONE AS HE INTERRUPTS THEIR RIDE SEIZING ZAC AND PULLING OUT A BIT OF HIS HAIR
YOU1000000021_S0000161	HE KNOWS THEY ARE HOJO'S LATEST EXPERIMENTS AND MODIFIED VERSIONS OF JANOVA'S POWER RUNS THROUGH BOTH OF THEM
YOU1000000021_S0000162	HE ADDS ONE OF HIS CLONES EAT HIS HAIR SAMPLE IN ORDER TO GAIN THE CELLS NEEDED TO CEASE HIS DEGRADATION BUT ALL IT DOES IS MUTATE THE CLONE INTO A GRUESOME MONSTER

YOU1000000021_S0000167	GENESIS BELIEVES A PURE S CELL SAMPLE WILL STOP THEIR DEGRADATION AND ONLY CLOUD AND ZAC BEAR THOSE RIGHT NOW
YOU1000000021_S0000168	HOLLANDER MAKES A GRAB FOR CLOUD BUT ZACK PUTS AN END TO THE DOCTOR ONCE AND FOR ALL WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM FORMER DIRECTOR LAZARD
YOU1000000021_S0000169	HE'S WHITE WINGED AND DEGRADING LIKE ANGIEL WITH HIS EXACT FACE PRECISELY BECAUSE HE'S BEEN TURNED INTO AN ANGIEL COPY BY HIS OWN DOING
YOU1000000021_S0000170	WHILE THE REAL ANGIELE REALLY IS DEAD LAZARD FINDS HIMSELF WITH ANGIELE'S WILL TO SAVE ZACH AND OTHERS WHICH MEANS THEY MUST STOP GENESIS ONCE AND FOR ALL
YOU1000000021_S0000171	ALMOST TO MIDGOD ZACH STOPS TO FINALLY CONFRONT THE FAILED AND TORTURED CREATION OF A GENOVA INFUSED HUMAN WHO CONSIDERS ZACH A PERFECT FUSION OF ANGIEL'S WILL AND SEFAR'S SUPERIOR CELLS

YOU1000000021_S0000174	ZACH WINS OVER THIS FORM REVERTING GENESIS TO HIS ORIGINAL FORM ONCE MORE WHO IS NOW CURED OF HIS DEGRADATION THANKS TO THE MATERIAL
YOU1000000021_S0000175	ZACH SEES NO REASON TO FIGHT NOW BUT GENESIS STILL INSISTS AND ZAC IS FRUSTRATED THAT ONCE AGAIN HE HAS TO SHOULDER A BURDEN FORCED UPON HIM
YOU1000000021_S0000176	CLASHING ONE FINAL TIME HE KNOCKS GENESIS BACK WHO FOR AN INSTANT TURNS AROUND AND SEES THE GODDESS MONERVA AS HE ALWAYS IMAGINED JUST BEFORE FALLING FOR GOOD IN THE LIFESTREAM SIGNIFYING HIS FINAL DEFEAT

YOU1000000033_S0000126	AND THEY SAID DON'T DON'T YOU NEED TO TALK TO ANYBODY ABOUT THIS OR DON'T YOU NEED TO PRAY ABOUT THIS AND I SAID
YOU1000000033_S0000127	NO I THINK THE LORD PREPARED ME AND RALPH HAD SAID JUST PRAY IF IT IF SOMETHING HAPPENS HAND WE'LL KNOW THIS IS FROM THE LORD
YOU1000000033_S0000128	MY RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY HAD PRAYED ABOUT IT KNEW ABOUT IT SO WHEN THE INVITATION CAME IT WAS LIKE ALL THE GROUNDWORK HAD BEEN RAISED SO HAD BEEN LAID SO FROM THEN ON I'VE THAT'S ONE OF THE MAIN THINGS I'VE BEEN DOING

YOU1000000033_S0000141	ANOTHER IMPORTANT PIECE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING IS AND HAVE DONE FROM THE BEGINNING IS IS FIND A WAY TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE MORE LAY PEOPLE DIRECTLY IN MINISTRY AND EVANGELIZATION
YOU1000000033_S0000142	SO RAISED UP MORE AND MORE PEOPLE TO WORK WITH US INTERNATIONALLY ON MISSION TEAMS GOING ALL OVER THE WORLD OUR COUNTRY COORDINATOR S WE CALL THEM
YOU1000000033_S0000143	AND THEN LAST FEW YEARS WITH A WITH A HEART FOR MILLENNIALS WE JUST FELT LIKE THE LORD SAID THERE'S A INAN ARBOUR AREA HERE THERE ARE LOTS OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE A SERIOUS CALL IN THEIR LIFE FROM THE LORD AND THEY'VE REALLY GROWN A LOT
YOU1000000033_S0000144	THEY THEY JUST HAD A LOT OF SUPPORT AND FORMATION IN THEIR LIFE AND WE FELT LIKE THE LORD SAID HELP RELEASE THEM INTO WHAT I'VE CALLED THEM TO DO MAKE A WAY FOR THEM MAKE A PATH AND SO THAT'S PARTLY WHAT WE'VE DONE TOO THAT'S WHERE I D NINE SIXTEEN THE YOUNG ADULT MINISTRY EMERGED FROM
YOU1000000033_S0000145	ONE OF THE REALLY THINGS THE LORD HAS CALLED ALL OF US TO PETER AND SISTER ANNE AND MYSELF IS TO EXPRESS IN WRITING SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE FEEL LIKE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT TRUTHS THAT PEOPLE NEED TO HEAR RIGHT NOW IN OUR CULTURE
YOU1000000033_S0000146	AND SO LIKE FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS FOR ME WAS REALLY FINISHING A BOOK THAT I WORKED ON FOR TEN YEARS IT'S CALLED THE FULFILLMENT OF ALL DESIRE A GUIDEBOOK FOR THE JOURNEY TO GOD BASED ON THE WISDOM OF SAINTS
YOU1000000033_S0000147	JUST REALLY FELT LIKE THERE'S SUCH A TREASURE OF WISDOM IN OUR CHURCH IN THESE GREAT DOCTORS OF THE CHURCH BUT LIKE LIKE IT USED TO HAPPEN TO ME YEARS AGO THE FIRST TIME I PICKED UP A BOOK BY JON OF THE CROSS IT WAS LIKE WHAT
YOU1000000033_S0000148	WHAT'S HE TALKING ABOUT AND WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT WAS SO SCARY I DECIDED TO PUT THE BOOK DOWN AND THEN TWENTY FIVE YEARS LATER IT'S JUST LIKE IT ALL KIND OF CAME ALIVE FOR ME AND ISO I JUST REALLY FELT LIKE THIS TREMENDOUS STUFF HERE
YOU1000000033_S0000149	IF YOU COULD JUST COMMUNICATE T IN A CLEAR ORDERLY UNDERSTANDABLE WAY PEOPLE WOULD GET SO MUCH HELP IN GROWING THEIR UNION WITH THE LORD A
YOU1000000033_S0000150	PETER'S WRITTEN BOOKS LIKE THAT AND SISTER ANNE'S WRITEN BOOKS LIKE THAT ND SO PART OF PART OF THE MINISTRY IS ALSO THE WRITING WHICH WHICH HAS HELPED AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE
YOU1000000033_S0000152	JOHN PAUL WAS A KIND OF SHEPHERD AND GUIDE FOR US HE WAS THE GUY WHO INTERPRETED FOR US WHAT THE SPIRIT IS SAYING TO THE CHURCH AND AND IT CORRESPONDED WITH WHAT OUR SENSE WAS SO HE CONFIRMED US IN THE MISSION
YOU1000000033_S0000153	WE HAD GONE TO ROME WE WERE DOING A CONFERENCE IN ROME AND THE LAST NIGHT THAT WE WERE THERE WE GOT A PHONE CALL FROM THE HOLY FATHER JOHN PAUL ASKING IF WE WOULD LIKE TO COME TO HIS MASS THE NEXT MORNING
YOU1000000033_S0000154	YOU KNOW WAS LIKE LIKE TO YOUKOW OF COURSE SO WE WE WENT THERE AND AFTER MASS WHEN HE CAME TO RALPH WHO IS NEXT TO ME
YOU1000000033_S0000155	I GAVE HIM A COPY OF MY LATEST BOOK AT THE TIME CALLED THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AT THE END OF THE AGE WHAT IS THE SPIRIT SAYING HE TOOK THE BOOK AND HE SAID YOU KNOW I READ IT ALREADY I ALMOST FELL OVER I ALMOST BECAME SPEECHLESS
YOU1000000033_S0000156	THEN HE TURNED TO RALPH AND HE TOOK RALPH BY THE UPPER ARMS HE JUST TOOK HIM AND KIND OF SHOOK HIM LIKE THIS AND HE SAID RALPH TELL ME WHAT IS THE SPIRIT SAYING TO THE CHURCH
YOU1000000033_S0000158	AND I KNEW HE DIDN'T WANT THE WHOLE THREE HUNDRED PAGE ANSWER SO I SAID HOLY FATHER I THINK WHAT THE SPIRIT IS SAYING TO THE CHURCH IS JESUS SO HE TOOK MY HAND AND HE SAID JESUS AND I SAID JESUS
YOU1000000033_S0000159	WE JUST STOOD THERE FOR A COUPLE MINUTES SAYING THE NAME OF JESUS AND IT WAS JUST A VERY VERY SPECIAL MOMENT OF COMMUNION WITH THE LORD AND COMMUNON WITH THE POPE AND JUST PROCLAIMING THE NAME OF JESUS TOGETHER AS JUST VERY VERY SPECIAL
YOU1000000033_S0000160	JOHN PAUL THE SECOND'S OUR PATRON YOU KNOW ONE OFOUR ONE OF OUR CENTRAL THE CENTRAL PATRON MAYBE OF OF RENEWAL MINISTRIES AND SO HE'S A GREAT INTERCESSOR FOR US WE CONTINUE TO PRAY WE ASK FOR HIS HELP I FEEL HIS PRESENCE ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M ON MISSION INTERNATIONALLY
YOU1000000033_S0000161	IN A VERY SPECIAL WAY WE'VE ASKED ST JOHN PAUL THE SECOND TO BE OUR PATRION WE ALSO ASK MARY
YOU1000000033_S0000162	YOU KNOW SHE'S THE QUEEN OF THE NEW EVANGELIZATION SHE'S SHE'S APPEARING IN THE WORLD SHE'S SHE'S CARRYING FORTH THE MESSAGE SHE'S SORT OF LIKE LEADING THE CHARGE IN MANY WAYS
YOU1000000033_S0000163	AND WE WE PRAY WE TRY TO STAY CLOSE WE TRY TO LISTEN YOU KNOW TO WHAT'S HAPPENING THROUGH THE APPARITIONS THAT ARE ACCEPTED BY THE CHURCH AND WHAT'S THE MESSAGE THERE AS WELL BECAUSE IT'S PROPHETIC
YOU1000000033_S0000164	IT'S A PROPHETIC MESSAGE AND WE FEEL LIKE WE ARE A PROPHETIC MINISTRY IN PART YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE MEANT TO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WE'RE MEANT TO REALLY DIALE INTO TRY TO HEAR WHAT THE SPIRIT IS SAYING TO THE CHURCH TODAY AND TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE THAT TO OTHER PEOPLE
YOU1000000033_S0000165	UTWHAT DOES GOD WANT
YOU1000000033_S0000167	FROM US WHO ARE HIS SONS AND DAUGHTERS HOW ARE WE CALLED TO LIVE IN THIS GENERATION IN THIS TIME AND ALL OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE CERTAINLY BEGINNING TO FACE
YOU1000000033_S0000168	BECAUSE RIGHT NOW SEVENTEEN HUNDRED YEARS OF CHRISTIAN CULTURE IS COLLAPSING ALL KINDS OF SUPPORTS THAT USED TO BE THERE FOR LIVING A MORAL LIFE FOR ALL KINDS OF RESPECT THAT USED TO BE THERE FOR THE CHURCH FOR THE SYNAGOGUE WHATEVER JIST ISN'T THERE ANYMORE
YOU1000000033_S0000169	AND MORE AND MORE WE'RE LIVING IN THE GROWTH OF AN INTERNATIONAL PAGAN CULTURE THAT'S BECOMING INCREASINGLY HOSTILE TO CHRIST AND THE CHURCH WHERE IS THEIR LOYALTY
YOU1000000033_S0000170	WHAT DO THEY REALLY THINK ABOUT JESUS CHRIST ARE THEY WILLING TO SUFFER FOR HIM ARE THEY WILLING TO SUFFER RATHER THAN TO DENY HIM ARE THEY WILLING TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO PASS ON THE FAITH TO THEIR CHILDREN
YOU1000000033_S0000171	EVEN WHEN THE CULTURE IS PLACING TREMENDOUS OBSTACLES IN FRONT OF IT SO WE'RE LIVING IN QUITE A TIME OF CONFLICT AND DECISION IT'S FOR SUCH A TIME AS THIS THAT WE'VE BEEN CALLED TO DO WHAT WE'RE DOING
YOU1000000033_S0000172	I HOPE THAT RENEWAL MINISTRIES CAN HELP PEOPLE MAKE THE DECISION THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE FRIENDS OF JESUS CHRIST AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE LOYAL TO HIM EVEN IN THE MIDST OF TREMENDOUS OPPRESSION AND DIFFICULTIES
YOU1000000033_S0000173	THE CULTURE IS LETHAL
YOU1000000033_S0000175	RIGHT NOW IT'S IT'S NOT JUST KIND OF YOU KNOW ENTICING YOU
YOU1000000033_S0000176	IT'S IT'S JUST TAKING PEOPLE AND TAKING THEM RIGHT OUT OF THE FRAMEWORK IN WHICH THEY'VE LIVED WITH THE LITTLE FAITH THAT PERHAPS THEY'VE HAD
YOU1000000033_S0000177	EVEN IF THEIR FAITH IS STRONG THE ENTICEMENTS OF THE WORLD ARE NOW SO STRONG THAT IF PEOPLE AREN'T REALLY ROOTED IN GOD THEY CAN THEY CAN EASILY BE PULLED OUT WITHOUT EVEN REALIZING AT FIRST WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THEM
YOU1000000033_S0000178	SO IT'S IN ALL THESE WAYS THAT I THINK RENOAL MINISTRYS BRINGS A MESSAGE IT BRINGS THE LOVE OF GOD IT HELPS PEOPLE RIGHT WHERE THEY ARE YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE ASHAMED O WHERE YOU ARE
YOU1000000033_S0000179	JUST COME COME AND LEARN THE LOVE THAT GOD HAS FOR YOU COME AND LEARN THE MERCY THAT HE HAS FOR YOU AND THEN SEE AS YOU BECOME A DISCIPLE OF CHRIST SEE HOW HE WANTS TO USE YOU IN A WORLD THAT'S PRETTY BROKEN
YOU1000000033_S0000181	KNOW PITTE WHEN YOU'RE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT EVERY DAY AND YOU'RE GETTING UP EVERY DAY AND DO WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO SOMETIMES YOU DON'T GET THE WHOLE TRAJECTORY OF WHAT GOD'S DONE ND IT'S JUST AMAZING TO SEE WHAT THE LORD'S DONE WITH WITH US
YOU1000000033_S0000182	YEAHIT'S BEEN IT'S BEEN AN AMAZING JOURNEY
YOU1000000033_S0000184	NUMBE OF THINGS CAME TO MIND THINKING ABOUT IT IT'S NOT LIKE WE HAD A GRAND PLAN AT THE BEGINNING

YOU1000000033_S0000187	KNO I WAS JUST THINKING HOW POPE JOHN PAUL THE SECOND USED TO SAY ST JOHN PAUL THE SECOND AND NOW POPE FRANCIS EVEN SAYS YOU KNOW THAT THE PART OF THE SPIRIT'S MISSION IS TO REVEAL JESUS TO EVERY HUMAN HEART BUT TO CREATE MOVEMENT
YOU1000000033_S0000188	AND AS WE TOGETHER WERE ENCOUNTERING THE SPIRIT MORE DEEPLY HE MOVED US YEAH AND HE MOVED OTHER PEOPLE YEAH AND AND IT WAS LIKE WE WERE CARRIED ALONG

YOU1000000045_S0000046	THIS IS A SPECIFIC BOOK AND IT FEELS LIKE FOR A SPECIFIC TIME WHY
YOU1000000045_S0000048	BECAUSE WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT IN TODAY'S WORLD THE STORIES OF GUTZSI WOMEN AND LITERALLY THERE ARE MANY MILLIONS OF THEM
YOU1000000045_S0000049	BUT WE CHOSE A HUNDRED AND THREE TO WRITE ABOUT
YOU1000000045_S0000050	BECAUSE THEIR STORIES TELL US YES ABOUT THE STRUGGLES THAT THEY ENDURED
YOU1000000045_S0000051	AND THEIR PERSISTENCE TO TRY TO IMPROVE THEIR OWN LIVES AND THE LIVES OF PEOPLE AROUND THEM
YOU1000000045_S0000052	I THINK ESPECIALLY IN TODAY'S WORLD WE NEED TO BE REMINDED OF THESE KINDS OF STORIES AND THEY ARE HISTORIC AND CONTEMPORARY AND EVEN A FEW FICTIONAL
YOU1000000045_S0000053	AND THEY WERE WOMEN WHO INSPIRED ME AS A LITTLE GIRL AND THEN THROUGHOUT MY LIFE AND THE SAME WITH JELSE AND
YOU1000000045_S0000054	FACT WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW INSPIRATIONAL WOMEN WHEN SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL
YOU1000000045_S0000055	AND SO WE WANT TO SHARE THESE STORIES AND WE HOPE THAT PEOPLE CAN FIND SOME SOME MESSAGE THAT WILL HELP THEM
YOU1000000045_S0000056	
YOU1000000045_S0000057	ESPECIALLY YOU KNOW GIVEN THE DIFFICULTIES THAT A LOT OF A LOT OF PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD FACE RIGHT NOW
YOU1000000045_S0000058	IT'S INTERESTING CHELSCEA BECAUSE YOU'VE SAID YOU KNOW THERE WAS A TIME IN YOUR LIFE WHEN YOU WATCHED YOUR MOM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AND THERE WERE MORE WOMEN IN SPACE THAN RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT
YOU1000000045_S0000059	TWO
YOU1000000045_S0000060	RIGHT AND NOW YOU YOU HAVE A PLETHURA OF WOMEN I MEAN YOU HAVE SIX IN THE RACE AND YOU'VE SEEN HOW MANY WOMEN PARTICIPATED IN IN THE MIDTERMS AND ONE AS WELL
YOU1000000045_S0000061	DO YOU FEEL LIKE WE'RE NOTICING A SHIFT IN SOCIETY THAT'S POSITIVELY MOVING US TO A PLACE WHERE THERE'S EQUALITY NOT THERE YET BUT JUST MOVING US IN THAT DIRECTION
YOU1000000045_S0000062	I THINK WE'RE ABSOLUTELY MAKING PROGRESS I ALSO REALLY APPRECIATE HOW YOU FRAMED THE QUESTION TREVOR BECAUSE IT'S SUPER IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T GET COMPLACENT
YOU1000000045_S0000063	AND THAT WE ALSO UNDERSTAND STILL HOW FAR WE HAVE TO GO
YOU1000000045_S0000064	MEAN EVEN THOUG E HAD AN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF WOMEN RUN FOR CONGRESS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE WERE STILL LESS THAN A QUARTER OF ALL DECLARED CANDIDATES
YOU1000000045_S0000065	WOW
YOU1000000045_S0000066	SO MAKING PROGRESS BUT WE STILLHAVE A LONG WAYS TO GO TO GET TO PAROTY BUT AS WE'VE SEEN LIKE WHO RUNS FOR OFFICE REALLY MATTERS BECAUSE IT DETERMINES WHO HOLDS OFFICE
YOU1000000045_S0000067	IM SO THRILLED THAT MY CHILDREN ARE GROWING UP WITH THE MOST DIVERSE CONGRESS IN AMERICAN HISTORY
YOU1000000045_S0000068	YOU HAVE CHOSEN A HUNDRED AND THREE WOMEN IN THIS BOOK WHO ALL HAVE DIFFERENT STORIES OF BEING GUTSY BUT WHAT WOULD YOU FIND WAS THE COMMON THREAD THAT MADE THEM WHO THEY ARE
YOU1000000045_S0000069	ONE I THINK THE SENSE OF JUST DEEP PURPOSE SOMETIMES SOMETHING THAT THEY KNEW FROM WHEN THEY WERE LITTLE GIRL
YOU1000000045_S0000070	EJANE GOODALL ALWAYS KNEW SHE WANTED TO WORK WITH ANIMALS AND SALLY RYD IND OF THE FIRST AMERICAN WOMAN IN SPACE
YOU1000000045_S0000071	REALLY BECAME A PHYSICIST BECAUSE SHE WASN'T A GOOD ENOUGH TENNIS PLAYER SO SHE KIND OF FAN FOUND HER PASSION LATER IN LIFE
YOU1000000045_S0000072	WHAT IS SO DISTINCTIVE ABOUT ALL THESE WOMEN IS THAT THEY BROUGHT OTHERS ALONG WITH THEM
YOU1000000045_S0000073	SOMETIMES CONSCIOUSLY BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS AND SOMETIMES JUST REALLY AWARE OF THEIR EXAMPLE
YOU1000000045_S0000074	AND I FIND THAT REALLY POWERFUL AND GUTZY THAT IT WASN'T JUST FOR THEMSELVES IT WAS FOR OTHERS TOO

YOU1000000045_S0000088	AND YET THEY ARE SO PERSISTENT IN PUTTING FORTH THESE CRAZY IDEAS AND THEORIES

YOU1000000045_S0000102	BUT I ALSO THINK IT'S BECAUSE IT IS EFFECTIVE LIKE I'LL NEVER FORGET READING AN ARTICLE AFTER THE TWENTY SIXTEEN ELECTION
YOU1000000045_S0000103	WHERE THE REPORTER INTERVIEWED SOMEONE WHO HAD BEEN AN UNDECIDED VOTER
YOU1000000045_S0000104	HE SAID YOU KNOW HE THOUGHT MY MOM HAD WON ALL THREE DEBATES SHE CLEARLY HAD A GREATER COMMAND OF THE SUBJECT MATTER AND YET HE JUST KEPT READING THAT SHE HAD MURDERED MORE THAN FIFTY PEOPLE
YOU1000000045_S0000105	AND HE SAID SOMEWHAT NONCHALANTLY LIKE I DON'T THINK THAT SHE MURDERED FIFTY BUT LIKE WHAT IF SHE MURDERED TWO

YOU1000000045_S0000110	REVER IT'S YOU HAVE TO LAUGH AT IT BECAUSE IT'S SO CRAZY BUT ON THE OTHER HAND WE FACE A SERIOUS PROBLEM
YOU1000000045_S0000111	OF A LOT OF THESE FALSEHOODS AND THESE CRAZY STORIES TAKING ON LIVES OF THEIR OWN
YOU1000000045_S0000112	NOT ABOUT ME BUT ABOUT EVERYBODY AND PARTICULARLY ANYBODY IN THE PUBLIC ARENA
YOU1000000045_S0000113	AND I HAVE BEEN VERY OUTSPOKEN ABOUT THE DECISION BY FACEBOOK TO ALLOW TRULY FALSE POLITICAL ADS TO BE RUN
YOU1000000045_S0000114	I WANT TO APPLAUD TWITTER FOR ANNOUNCING THEY WERE NOT GOING TO LET THAT GO FORWARD AND I HOPE I REALLY HOPE FACEBOOK CHANGES THEIR MIND
YOU1000000045_S0000115	BECAUSE MORE THAN HALF THE PEOPLE IN AMERICA GET THEIR NEWS FROM FACEBOOK AND YOU I EAN THAT'S
YOU1000000045_S0000116	WO BUT NO BUT FACEBOOK BUT FACEBOOK IS IS IS A REAL ISSUE AND WE ARE LIVING IN A WORLD WHERE PEOPLE NO LONGER KNOW WHAT TRUTH IS AND DON'T EVEN AGREE ON IT WHICH WHICH SEEMS TO BE A LARGER ISSUE
YOU1000000045_S0000117	YOU'VE WITNESSED THE CHANGE IN POLITICS THROUGH MANY DIFFERENT TIMES
YOU1000000045_S0000118	IN FACT WE'RE IN AN INTERESTING PERIOD NOW WHERE THE COUNTRYIS GEARING UP FOR IMPEACHMENT
YOU1000000045_S0000119	AND YOU ARE IN AN INTERESTING POSITION WHERE IN YOUR LIFE YOU HAVE BEEN LITERALLY A PART OF EVERY SINGLE IMPEACHMENT IN SOME WAY SHAPE OR FORM
YOU1000000045_S0000120	YOU HAD THE WATERGATE INVESTIGATIONS THAT YOU WERE A PART OF YOU THEN HAD YOUR HUSBAND WHO WAS IMPEACHED AND NOW YOUR POLITICAL OPPONENT IS GETTING IMPEACHED
YOU1000000045_S0000121	DO YOU HAVE THE IMPEACHMENT TOUCH IS THIS LIKE A THI
YOU1000000045_S0000122	YOU KNOW I WASN'T PART OF ANDREW JOHNSON BUT YOU KNOW OTHER THER THAN THAT YES
YOU1000000045_S0000123	IT IS A STRANGE PERSPECTIVE TO HAVE BECAUSE I WAS A YOUNG LAWYER INVESTIGATING RICHARD NIXON
YOU1000000045_S0000124	AND I AM VERY PLEASED THAT THE HOUSE TODAY IS PROCEEDING IN SUCH A DELIBERATIVE MANNER THEY HAD THAT VOTE TODAY ABOUT THE PROCEDURES
YOU1000000045_S0000125	BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR AT FIRST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE LOOKED AT THE IDEA THAT NIXON WOULD BE IMPEACHED AFTER HE WON A MASSIVE LANDSLIDE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO
YOU1000000045_S0000126	THEY TSOUGHT WELL THAT THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE BUT AS THE EVIDENCE CAME OUT AND WE WERE LITERALLY WORKING EIGHTEEN HOURS A DAY
YOU1000000045_S0000127	OMPILING EVIDENCE MAKING YOU KNOW THE LEGAL ARGUMENTS THE CONSTITUTIONAL ARGUMENTS
YOU1000000045_S0000128	AND FINALLY PEOPLE REALIZED THAT
YOU1000000045_S0000129	YEAH OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE ABUSE OF POWER CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS ARE NOT WHAT WE WANT TO TURN A BLIND EYE TO IN OUR COUNTR
YOU1000000045_S0000130	WE NEED CHECKS AND BALANCES IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE RULE OF LAW IS AT THE CORE OF OUR DEMOCRACY
YOU1000000045_S0000131	SO I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE ABOUT HOW THE HOUSE'S POWER IS SUPPOSED TO WORK
YOU1000000045_S0000132	I WAS PART OF SEEING IT WORK I BELIEVE IN THE RIGHT WAY ONE OF THE PEOPLE WE PROFILE S BARBARA JORDAN
YOU1000000045_S0000133	IF YOU GO TO YOUTUBE YOU CAN SEE HER SPEECH WHEN SHE VOTED ON THE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR WITH HER DEFENSE OF THE CONSTITUTION
YOU1000000045_S0000134	AND SO I'M HOPING THAT NOW THAT THIS IS GOING TO MOVE TOWARD PUBLIC HEARINGS
YOU1000000045_S0000135	WHERE PEOPLE CAN SEE THESE WITNESSES IN PERSON THEY CAN BE LIKE A JUROR THEMSELVES TRYING TO DECIDE
YOU1000000045_S0000136	THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL YOU KNOW MAKE A VERY CAREFUL STUDY OF WHAT THEY'RE BEING TOLD
YOU1000000045_S0000137	BECAUSE THE FOUNDERS PUT IMPEACHMENT IN THE CONSTITUTION FOR A REASON
YOU1000000045_S0000138	WE HAVE ELECTIONS BUT IN BETWEEN ELECTIONS IF THERE'S BEHAVIOR THAT IS UNDERMINING OUR COUNTRY ENDANGERING OUR NATIONAL SECURITY
YOU1000000045_S0000139	AS THE ALLEGATIONS HERE ARE IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY REMEDY BUT ONE THAT HAS TO BE EXERCISED IN A SOBER CAREFUL WAY
YOU1000000045_S0000140	IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE AMERICA'S IN A PLACE WHERE IT FEELS LIKE THIS PROCESS AND PROCEDURE WILL BE TESTED MORE THAN EVER BEFORE BECAUSE OF HOW PARTEES IN AMERICA HAS BECOME
YOU1000000045_S0000141	BECAUSE OF HOW YOU KNOW TOXIC POLITICS IN AMERICA HAS BECOME
YOU1000000045_S0000142	AND I WAS INTERESTED N CHELSEAY BECAUSE I'VE NOTICED A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE ASKED YOU WHY YOU AREN'T RUNNING FOR AN OPEN SEAT IN CHAPAKUA
YOU1000000045_S0000143	YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF NEW YORK STATE THERE IS A SEAT THAT IS OPEN AND YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO TAKE THAT SEAT IN MANY PEOPLE'S OPINION
YOU1000000045_S0000144	AND YOU'VE OFTEN SAID NO THERE'S OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE WHO COULD TAKE IT AND EVERYONE SAID YES BUT YOU WOULD DEFINITELY YOU KNOW TAKE THAT SEAT AND YOU WOULD RUN WITH IT AND YOU'VE SAID YOU ARE INTERESTED IN CHANGING PEOPLE'S LIVES
YOU1000000045_S0000145	DO YOU HAVE A HESITANT HESITANCY TO ENGAGE IN POLITICS BECAUSE OF HOW YOUR MOM HAS BEEN TREATED IN HER LIFE
YOU1000000045_S0000146	NO BECAUSE I SEE HER GET UP EVERY DAY AND STILL ENGAGE
YOU1000000045_S0000147	AND SO FOR ME THE DECISION TO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT KIND OF RUNNING FOR
YOU1000000045_S0000148	THE SEAT THAT CONGRESSWOMAN NETA LOI WILL LEAVE AT THE END OF NEXT YEAR
YOU1000000045_S0000149	IS MORE ABOUT AN AFFIRMATION OF WHAT I'M DOING NOW
YOU1000000045_S0000150	AND I'M THRILLED THAT THERE ARE ALREADY SO MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE THROWN THEIR HATS INTO THE
YOU1000000045_S0000151	I HOPE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T KIND OF SEE THE TOXICITY IN THIS MOMENT AND TURN AWAY FROM IT I HOPE THEY SEE IT AND SAY I WANT TO CHANGE THAT
YOU1000000045_S0000152	AND I WANT TO GET BACK TO A PLACE OF SCIENCE AND EVIDENCE BASED DECISIONS AND RESPECT FOR OUR DEMOCRACY AD RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW
YOU1000000045_S0000153	SO I HOPE PEOPLE TAKE IT PERVERSELY AS AN OPPORTUNITY
YOU1000000045_S0000154	
YOU1000000045_S0000155	FOR WHAT MUST BE DIFFERENT AND THEN BE PART OF THE CHANGE OF DOING A
YOU1000000045_S0000156	BECAUSE IT HASN'T YOU KNOW IT HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THAT WE'VE HAD PARTINPARTISANSHIP FROM THE VERY BEGINNING
YOU1000000045_S0000157	BUT THERE'S ALSO BEEN A LOT OF EFFORT TO FIND COMMON GROUND SO BACK TO THE NIXON IMPEACHMENT
YOU1000000045_S0000158	WHEN THE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT WERE VOTED ON MEMBERS OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN THE CONGRESS VOTED FOR ONE OR MORE OF HE
YOU1000000045_S0000159	SO THERE HAS BEEN MANY TIMES
YOU1000000045_S0000160	WRITE ABOUT MARGARET CHA SMITH A REPUBLICAN WOMAN SENATOR FROM MAINE WHO WAS THE FIRST MEMBER OF HER PARTY TO STAND UP TO JOSEPH MACARTHEY IN THE EARLY NINETEEN FIFTY S
YOU1000000045_S0000161	SO WE'VE HAD NOT ONLY PEOPLE BUT A CONSENSUS AROUND WHAT IT IS WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT AND CHERISH
YOU1000000045_S0000162	AND SO I CAN HOPE THAT MAYBE THERE'LL BE ENOUGH PEOPLE WHO MAKE THEIR DECISION NOT ON YOU KNOW PROTECTING THE PRESIDENT BUT PROTECTING THE COUNTRY
YOU1000000045_S0000163	EITHER WAY THEY END UP
YOU1000000045_S0000164	IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE MANY OF TH THE WOMEN YOU'VE WRITTEN ABOUT IN THE BOOK ALSO SHARE ONE COMMON TRAIT AND THAT IS THE OBSTACLES THEY HAD TO OVERCOME
YOU1000000045_S0000165	OFTEN INCLUDED BEING ACCUSED OF THINGS OR BEING SCRUTINIZED IN A WAY THAT WAS NOT SIMILAR TO THE MEN AROUND THEM TO THEIR MALE COUNTERPARTS
YOU1000000045_S0000166	HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND TO A TRUMP SUPPORTER IF THEY TOOK THE TIME TO LISTEN TO YOU AND SAID
YOU1000000045_S0000167	HILLARY I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR THAT TRUMP IS GOING TO BE IMPEACHED FOR GETTING INFORMATION FROM UKRAINE
YOU1000000045_S0000168	WHEN YOUR TEAM ENGAGED IN RUSSIAN INFORMATION THROUGH YOU KNOW THE CO THTHE TEAM THAT WORKED ON THAT SIDE ON THE STEEL DOSIE
YOU1000000045_S0000169	OW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT PERSON WHEN THEY SAY YOU ENGAGED IN FOREIGN INFORMATION ON A POLITICAL RIVAL TRUMP DID THE SAME WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE
YOU1000000045_S0000170	THERE'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE M YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT THE POWER THAT THE PRESIDENT HOLDS
YOU1000000045_S0000171	THE PRESIDENT IS IN A POSITION TO USE AMERICAN LEVERAGE AND CREDIBILITY TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS OF OUR NATION
YOU1000000045_S0000172	SO I COULD IMAGINE NOI COULD IMAGINE A CONVERSATION WHERE A PRESIDENT WOULD SAY TO THE PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE
YOU1000000045_S0000173	YOU'RE NEW AT THE JOB ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS HELD YOU BACK IS CORRUPTION WE WANT TO HELP YOU FIGHT CORRUPTIN
YOU1000000045_S0000174	WE WANT EVIDENCE THAT YOU ARE REALLY DEDICATED TO FIGHTING CORRUPTION RIGHT IF THAT'S ALL THAT HAD BEEN SAID
YOU1000000045_S0000175	THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH TH
YOU1000000045_S0000176	SECRETARY OF STATE I USED TO GO AND VISIT LEADERS AND SAY YOU KNOW ONE OF YOUR BIGGEST PROBLEMS IS YOU'VE GOT RAMPANT CORRUPTIO
YOU1000000045_S0000177	IT'S IN YOUR FAMILY IT'S IN YOUR PEOPLE AROUND YOU YOU'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH IT
YOU1000000045_S0000178	BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED AND WE NOW HAVE NOT ONLY THE WHISTLEBLOWER AND THE ALLEGED INCOMPLETE TRANSCRIPT
YOU1000000045_S0000179	E NOW HAVE A LOT OF WITNESSES WHO ARE ALL SAYING THIS WAS ABOUT HELPING THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF
YOU1000000045_S0000180	HE IS ACTING AS THE PRESIDENT HE'S NOT A POLITICAL CANDIDATE RIGHTHE IS NOT A PRIVATE CITIZEN HE'S THE PRESIDENT
YOU1000000045_S0000181	NOW WORKS FOR THE UNITED STATES
YOU1000000045_S0000182	WORKS IN THE UNITED STATES AND WE DON'T WANT TO SQUANDER OUR CREDIBILITY
YOU1000000045_S0000183	SO IF OTHER COUNTRIES SEE THIS AS THEY CLEARLY ARE
YOU1000000045_S0000184	THIS PRESIDENT REALLY COULD CARE LESS ABOUT UKRAINE COULD CARELESS WHETHER IT BECOMES A STABLE COUNTRY COULD CARE LESS WHETHER IT'S ABLE TO DEFEND ITSELF AGAINST RUSSIA
YOU1000000045_S0000185	ALL HE WANTS IS FOR THEM TO MANUFACTURE SOME KIND OF DAMAGING INFORMATION
YOU1000000045_S0000186	ABOUT THE PERSON HE THINKS IS HIS LIKELY OPPONENT JOE BIDEN
YOU1000000045_S0000187	SO THERE'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE I MEAN PEOPLE CAN GATHER YOU KNOW INFORMATION IN YOU KNOW ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT WAYS
YOU1000000045_S0000188	BUT WHEN YOU COMBINE IT WITH THAT QUID PRO QUO THAT EXISTED IN THAT CONVERSATION WHICH HAS NOW BEEN VERIFIED REPEATEDLY
YOU1000000045_S0000189	PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE ROOM PEOPLE WHO WERE UNDER PRESSURE
YOU1000000045_S0000190	TO DEPRIVE THE UKRAINIANS OF MILITARY AID SO THEY COULD DEFEND THEMSELVES THERE'S AN ACTIFE WAR GOING ON IN EASTERN UKRAINE
YOU1000000045_S0000191	THE RUSSIANS AND THEIR PROXIES ARE STILL KILLING UKRAINIANS AND SO
YOU1000000045_S0000192	WHAT THIS PRESIDENT HAS BASICALLY DONE IS SAY I DON'T CARE I DON'T CARE ABOUT ANY OF THAT I JUST NEED SOME DIRT
YOU1000000045_S0000193	AND I DON'T CARE IF YOU MAKE IT UP YOU KNOW IN ORDER TO GET MILITARY AID YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE ME SOMETHING ON JOE BIDEN AND HIS
YOU1000000045_S0000194	IT REALLY DOES SEEM LIKE TRUMP HAS TAKEN AN UNCONVENTIONAL APPROACH AT TO SAY THE LEAST IN INTERNATIONAL A
YOU1000000045_S0000195	HE'S BEEN VERY EXPLICIT IN SAYING IT'S AMERICA FIRST AND THAT'S ALL I CARE ABOUT SYRIA HAS BEEN AN INTERESTING CASE
YOU1000000045_S0000196	AND AS A FORMER SECRETARY UYOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO SPEAK TO THIS WITH AN IN DEPTH KNOWLEDGE
YOU1000000045_S0000197	TRUMP SAID I PULLED THE TROOPS OUT BECAUSE IT'S TIME FOR AMERICA TO LEAVE THESE ENDLESS WARS EVERYONE SPOKE OUT AGAINST TRUMP FOR DOING THIS
YOU1000000045_S0000198	BUT IT WAS ONE OF YOUR FORMER AMBASSADORS ROBERT FORD WHO SAID AT ONE POINT THAT THE ALLIANCE WITH THE KURDS WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE PERMANENT
YOU1000000045_S0000199	IT WAS JUST MEANT TO BE A TEMPORARY COMING TOGETHER BECAUSE BOTH SIDES WANTED TO BEAT ISIS AND THEY WEREN'T ALLIES OF ALL TIME WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE MORE CORRECT APPROACH THEN
YOU1000000045_S0000200	LOOK I DON'T THINK HIS REAL PHILOSOPHY IS AMERICA FIRST I THINK IT'S TRUMP FIRST AND HE JUDGES EVERYTHING AS TO HOW IT WILL HELP HIM
YOU1000000045_S0000201	AND PERHAPS HE IMPULSIVELY DECIDED THAT BRINGING OUR TROOPS HOME WAS GOOD FOR HIM POLITICALLY
YOU1000000045_S0000202	AND THAT SEEMS TO BE HOW HE IS JUSTIFYING IT
YOU1000000045_S0000203	BUT LET'S ASSUME WE HAD A PRESIDENT WHO WAS INTERESTED IN ACHIEVING THAT GOAL IN A DEFENSIBLE WAY
YOU1000000045_S0000204	HERE'S WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED HE COULD AVE VERY WELL HAVE SAID TO THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT SYRIA THE KURDS THE TURKS AND OTHERS
YOU1000000045_S0000205	SAID YOU KNOW WE NEED TO START A PROCESS IN ORDER TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN PROTECT THE KURDS WHO HAVE BEEN OUR ALLIES
YOU1000000045_S0000206	MAYBE NOT FOR ALL TIME
YOU1000000045_S0000207	THEY SURE HAVE BEEN SACRIFICING ON BEHALF OF OUR OBJECTIVE TO DRIVE THE ISLAMIC STATE OUT OF SYRIA
YOU1000000045_S0000208	AND WE KNOW THEY'RE HOLDING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PRISONERS FOR US SO LET'S NOT LEAVE THEM TO THEIR FATE
YOU1000000045_S0000209	LET'S FIGURE OUT HOW WE WORK WITH THE TURKS WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR BORDER LET'S SEE HOW WE WORK WITH THE KRDS LET'S USE THE LEVERAGE WE HAVE
YOU1000000045_S0000210	BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE TROOPS THAT ARE SPECIAL FORCES WHO ARE WORKING ALONGSIDE THE KURDS AND LET'S FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOIN TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN
YOU1000000045_S0000211	INSTEAD OF JUST WAKING UP AND WALKING TO THE SOUTH LAWN OF THE WHITE HOUSE AND SAYIN WE'RE BRINGING ALL OUR TROOPS HOME AND I'VE TALKED TO PRESIDENT ERDOWAN
YOU1000000045_S0000212	AND SINCE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HE SAYS ON THESE CALLS FOR ALL WE KNOW IT COULD BE HEY YOU KNOW PRESIDENT ERDOGAN WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR TROOPS OUT WHAT DO YOU HAVE ON JOE BIDEN
YOU1000000045_S0000213	WE DON'T KNOW
YOU1000000045_S0000214	
YOU1000000045_S0000215	AND THAT'S WHAT'S SO FRIGHTENING ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING
YOU1000000045_S0000216	BECAUSE HE HAS AN AFFINITY FOR DICTATORS HE'S CLEARLY MISJUDGED THE NORTH KOREANS A
YOU1000000045_S0000217	KIM JUNGUN HAS BEEN FIRING MISSILES AND OBVIOUSLY NOT BEHAVING THE WAY THAT A MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE LED HIM TO
YOU1000000045_S0000218	HE CLEARLY DOES PUTIN'S BIDDING I MEAN PUTIN COULD NOT BE HAPPIER TO HAVE THE UKRAINIANS CAUGHT UP IN THIS
YOU1000000045_S0000219	WHILE HE CONTINUES TO YOU KNOW EAT AWAY AT THEIR COUNTRY AND THEIR SOVEREIGNTY
YOU1000000045_S0000220	THE RUSSIANS HAVE A HUGE AMOUNT OF INFLUENCE NOW IN THE MIDDLE EAST
YOU1000000045_S0000221	BECAUSE THEY'RE RIGHT THERE IN SYRIA ALONGSIDE THE IRANIANS AND PROPPING UP THE ASSAD GOVERNMENT
YOU1000000045_S0000222	SO THERE'S A LOT OF MOVING PIECES ON THIS COMPLEX CHESSBOARD
YOU1000000045_S0000223	AND I'VE BEEN IN A WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM WHERE THE PRESIDENT WAS DEMANDING INFORMATION
YOU1000000045_S0000224	NOT ACTING ON IMPULSE WHERE WE WERE RUNNING THROUGH DIFFERENT SCENARIOS WHERE WE HAD TO BE CONSTANTLY TESTING OUR OPINIONS AGAINST OTHERS
YOU1000000045_S0000225	IN ORDER TO GIVE THE PRESIDENT THE BEST ADVICE THAT IS NOT HAPPENING IN THIS WHITE HOUSE
YOU1000000045_S0000226	IT IS UNFORTUNATELY UNPREDICTABLE ABOUT WHAT HE WILL DO NEXT
YOU1000000045_S0000227	SO THEREFORE OTHER COUNTRIES PARTICULARLY ONES ADVERSARIAL TO US
YOU1000000045_S0000228	ARE GOING AROUND THE WORLD SAYING YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T COUNT ON AMERICA ANYMORE RIGHT YOU KNOW COUNT ON US
YOU1000000045_S0000229	WILL SELL YOU ARMS NOT THE AMERICANS WILL MAKE DEALS WITH YOU NOT THE AMERICANS WILL HAVE INVESTMENTS IN YOUR COUNTRY NOT THE AMERICANS
YOU1000000045_S0000230	AND IT'S A TRAGEDY
YOU1000000045_S0000231	BECAUSE I THINK WE WERE REALLY WELL POSITIONED AT THE END OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO KEEP BUILDING ON OUR LEADERSHIP
YOU1000000045_S0000232	AND I THINK THAT'S BEEN SQUANDERED UNDER THIS PRESIDENT
YOU1000000045_S0000233	LET ME ASK YOU ONE QUESTION BEFORE WE WRAP IT UP THE BOOK OF GUTSE WOMEN TALKS ABOUT WOMEN WHO HAVE DONE SOMETHING AMAZING THROUGHOUT TIME

YOU1000000101_S0000009	AS A MATTER OF FACT I HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO CHOOSE MY OWN WORDS AND DISCUSS MY OWN IDEAS REGARDING THE CHOICE THAT WE FACE IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS
YOU1000000101_S0000010	I HAVE SPENT MOST OF MY LIFE AS A DEMOCRAT I RECENTLY HAVE SEEN FIT TO FOLLOW ANOTHER COURSE
YOU1000000101_S0000011	I BELIEVE THAT THE ISSUES CONFRONTING US CROSS PARTY LINES
YOU1000000101_S0000013	NOW ONE SIDE IN THIS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN TELLING US THAT THE ISSUES OF THIS ELECTION ARE THE MAINTENANCE OF PEACE AND PROSPERITY THE LINE HAS BEEN USED WE'VE NEVER HAD IT SO GOOD
YOU1000000101_S0000014	BUT I HAVE AN UNCOMFORTABLE FEELING THAT THIS PROSPERITY ISN'T SOMETHING ON WHICH WE CAN BASE OUR HOPES FOR THE FUTURE
YOU1000000101_S0000015	NO NATION IN HISTORY HAS EVER SURVIVED A TAX BURDEN THAT REACHED A THIRD OF ITS NATIONAL INCOME
YOU1000000101_S0000016	TODAY THIRTY SEVEN CENTS OUT OF EVERY DOLLAR EARNED IN THIS COUNTRY IS THE TAX COLLECTOR SHARE
YOU1000000101_S0000017	AND YET OUR GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO SPEND SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS A DAY MORE THAN THE GOVERNMENT TAKES IN
YOU1000000101_S0000018	WE HAVEN'T BALANCED OUR BUDGET TWENTY EIGHT OUT OF THE LAST THIRTY FOUR YEARS WE'VE RAISED OUR DEBT LIMIT THREE TIMES IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS
YOU1000000101_S0000019	AND NOW OUR NATIONAL DEBT IS ONE AND A HALF TIMES BIGGER THAN ALL THE COMBINED DEBTS OF ALL THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD
YOU1000000101_S0000020	WE HAVE FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN GOLD IN OUR TREASURY WE DON'T OWN AN OUNCE FOREIGN DOLLAR CLAIMS ARE TWENTY SEVEN POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS
YOU1000000101_S0000021	AND WE'VE JUST HAD ANNOUNCED THAT THE DOLLAR OF NINETEN THIRTY NINE WILL NOW PURCHASE FORTY FIVE CENTS IN ITS TOTAL VALUE
YOU1000000101_S0000022	AS FOR THE PEACE THAT WE WOULD PRESERVE
YOU1000000101_S0000023	I WONDER WHO AMONG US WOULD LIKE TO APPROACH THE WIFE OR MOTHER WHOSE HUSBAND OR SON HAS DIED IN SOUTH VIETNAM AND ASK THEM IF THEY THINK THIS IS A PEACE
YOU1000000101_S0000024	THAT SHOULD BE MAINTAINED INDEFINITELY DO THEY MEAN PEACE OR DO THEY MEAN WE JUST WANT TO BE LEFT IN PEACE
YOU1000000101_S0000025	THERE CAN BE NO REAL PEACE WHILE ONE AMERICAN IS DYING SOMEPLACE IN THE WORLD FOR THE REST OF US
YOU1000000101_S0000026	WE'RE AT WAR WITH THE MOST DANGEROUS ENEMY THAT HAS EVER FACED MANKIND IN HIS LONG CLIMB FROM THE SWAMP TO THE STARS
YOU1000000101_S0000027	AND IT'S BEEN SAID IF WE LOSE THAT WAR AND IN SO DOING LOSE THIS WAY OF FREEDOM OF OURS
YOU1000000101_S0000028	HISTORY WILL RECORD WITH THE GREATEST ASTONISHMENT THAT THOSE WHO HAD THE MOST TO LOSE DID THE LEAST TO PREVENT ITS HAPPENING
YOU1000000101_S0000029	WELL I THINK IT'S TIME WE ASK OURSELVES IF WE STILL KNOW THE FREEDOMS THAT WERE INTENDED FOR US BY THE FOUNDING FATHERS
YOU1000000101_S0000030	NOT TOO LONG AGO TWO FRIENDS OF MINE WERE TALKING TO A CUBAN REFUGEE A BUSINESS MAN WHO HAD ESCAPED FROM CASTRO
YOU1000000101_S0000031	AND IN THE MIDST OF HIS STORY ONE OF MY FRIENS TURNED TO THE OTHER AND SAID WE DON'T KNOW HOW LUCKY WE ARE AND THE CUBAN STOPPED AND SAID HOW LUCKY YOU ARE
YOU1000000101_S0000032	I HAD SOME PLACE TO ESCAPE TO AND IN THAT SENTENCE HE TOLD US THE ENTIRE STORY
YOU1000000101_S0000033	IF WE LOSE FREEDOM HERE THERE'S NO PLACE TO ESCAPE TO THIS IS THE LAST STAND ON EARTH
YOU1000000101_S0000034	AND THIS IDEA THAT GOVERNMENT IS BEHOLDEN TO THE PEOPLE THAT IT HAS NO OTHER SOURCE OF POWER EXCEPT THE SOVEREIGN PEOPLE
YOU1000000101_S0000035	I'S STILL THE NEWEST AND THE MOST UNIQUE IDEA IN ALL THE LONG HISTORY OF MAN'S RELATION TO MAN
YOU1000000101_S0000036	THIS IS THE ISSUE OF THIS ELECTION
YOU1000000101_S0000037	WHETHER WE BELIEVE IN OUR CAPACITY FOR SELF GOVERNMENT OR WHETHER WE ABANDON THE AMERICAN REVOLUTE
YOU1000000101_S0000038	AND CONFESS THAT A LITTLE INTELLECTUAL ELITE IN A FAR DISTANT CAPITAL CAN PLAN OUR LIVES FOR US BETTER THAN WE CAN PLANN THEM OURSELVES
YOU1000000101_S0000039	YOU AND I ARE TOLD INCREASINGLY WE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN A LEFT OR RIGHT WELL I'D LIKE TO SUGGEST THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A LEFT OR RIGHT
YOU1000000101_S0000040	THERE'S ONLY AN UP OR DOWN
YOU1000000101_S0000042	MAN'S OLD OLD AGE DREAM THE ULTIMATE IN INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM CONSISTENT WITH LAW AND ORDER OR DOWN TO THE ANTHEAP OF TOTALITARIANISM
YOU1000000101_S0000043	AND REGARDLESS OF THEIR SINCERITY THEIR HUMANITARIAN MOTIVES THOSE WHO WOULD TRADE OUR FREEDOM FOR SECURITY HAVE EMBARKED ON THIS DOWNWARD COURSE
YOU1000000101_S0000044	IN THIS VOTE HARVESTING TIME THEY USE TERMS LIKE THE GREAT SOCIETY
YOU1000000101_S0000045	OR AS WE WERE TOLD A FEW DAYS AGO BY THE PRESIDENT WE MUST ACCEPT A GREATER GOVERNMENT ACTIVITY IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE PEOPLE
YOU1000000101_S0000046	BUT THEY'VE BEEN A LITTLE MORE EXPLICIT IN THE PAST AND AMONG THEMSELVES AND ALL OF THE THINGS I NOW WILL QUOTE HAVE APPEARED IN PRINT
YOU1000000101_S0000047	THESE ARE NOT REPUBLICAN ACCUSATIONS
YOU1000000101_S0000048	FOR EXAMPLE THEY HAVE VOICES THAT SAY THE COLD WAR WILL END THROUGH OUR ACCEPTANCE OF A NOT UNDEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM
YOU1000000101_S0000049	ANOTHER VOICE SAYS THE PROFIT MOTIVE HAS BECOME OUTMODED IT MUST BE REPLACED BY THE INCENTIVES OF THE WELFARE STATE
YOU1000000101_S0000050	OR OUR TRADITIONAL SYSTEM OF INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM IS INCAPABLE OF SOLVING THE COMPLEX PROBLEMS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
YOU1000000101_S0000051	SENATOR FULBRIGHT HAS SAID AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY THAT THE CONSTITUTION IS OUTMODED
YOU1000000101_S0000052	HE REFERRED TO THE PRESIDENT AS OUR MORAL TEACHER AND OUR LEADER
YOU1000000101_S0000054	AND HE SAYS HE IS HOBBLED IN HIS TASK BY THE RESTRICTIONS OF POWER IMPOSED ON HIM BY THIS ANTIQUATED DOCUMENT
YOU1000000101_S0000055	HE MUST BE FREED SO THAT HE CAN DO FOR US WHAT HE KNOWS IS BEST
YOU1000000101_S0000056	AND SENATOR CLARK OF PENNSYLVANIA ANOTHER ARTICULATE SPOKESMAN DEFINES LIBERALISM AS MEETING THE MATERIAL NEEDS OF THE MASSES THROUGH THE FULL POWER OF CENTRALIZED GOVERNMENT
YOU1000000101_S0000057	WHILE I FOR ONE RESENT IT WHEN A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PEOPLE REFERS TO YOU AND ME THE FREE MEN AND WOMEN OF THIS COUNTRY AS THE MASSES
YOU1000000101_S0000058	THIS IS A TERM WE HAVEN'T APPLIED TO OURSELVES IN AMERICA
YOU1000000101_S0000059	BUT BEYOND THAT THE FULL POWER OF CENTRALIZED GOVERNMENT THIS WAS THE VERY THING THE FOUNDING FATHERS SOUGHT TO MINIMIZE
YOU1000000101_S0000060	THEY KNEW THAT GOVERNMENTS DON'T CONTROL THINGS A GOVERNMENT CAN'T CONTROL THE ECONOMY WITHOUT CONTROLLING PEOPLE
YOU1000000101_S0000061	AND THEY KNOW WHEN A GOVERNMENT SETS OUT TO DO THAT IT MUST USE FORCE AND COERCION TO ACHIEVE ITS PURPOSE
YOU1000000101_S0000062	THEY ALSO KNEW THOSE FOUNDING FATHERS THAT OUTSIDE OF ITS LEGITIMATE FUNCTIONS GOVERNMENT DOES NOTHING AS WELL OR AS ECONOMICALLY AS THE PRIVATE SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY
YOU1000000101_S0000063	NOW WE HAVE NO BETTER EXAMPLE OF THIS THAN GOVERNMENT'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE FARM ECONOMY OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS
YOU1000000101_S0000064	SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE THE COST OF THIS PROGRAM HAS NEARLY DOUBLED ONE FOURTH OF FARMING IN AMERICA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE FARM SURPLUS
YOU1000000101_S0000065	THREE FOURTHS OF FARMING IS OUT ON THE FREE MARKET AND HAS KNOWN A TWENTY ONE PERCENT INCREASE IN THE PER CAPITA CONSUMPTION OF ALL ITS PRODUCE
YOU1000000101_S0000066	YOU SEE THAT ONE FOURTH OF FARMING THAT'S REGULATED AND CONTROLLED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
YOU1000000101_S0000067	IN THE LAST THREE YEARS WE'VE SPENT FORTY THREE DOLLARS IN THE FEED GRAIN PROGRAM FOR EVERY DOLLAR BUSHEL OF CORN WE DON'T GROW
YOU1000000101_S0000068	SENATOR HUMPPHRY LAST WEEK CHARGED THAT BARRY GOLDWATER AS PRESIDENT WOULD SEEK TO ELIMINATE FARMERS HE SHOULD DO HIS HOMEWORK A LITTLE BETTER
YOU1000000101_S0000069	BECAUSE HE'LL FIND OUT THAT WE'VE HAD A DECLINE OF FIVE MILLION IN THE FARM POPULATION UNDER THESE GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS
YOU1000000101_S0000070	HE'LL ALSO FIND THAT THE DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATION HAS SOUGHT TO GET FROM CONGRESS
YOU1000000101_S0000071	EXTENSION OF THE FARM PROGRAM TO INCLUDE THAT THREE FORTHS THAT IS NOW FREE
YOU1000000101_S0000072	YOU'LL FIND THAT THEY'VE ALSO ASKED FOR THE RIGHT TO IMPRISON FARMERS WHO WOULDN'T KEEP BOOKS AS PRESCRIBED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
YOU1000000101_S0000073	THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE ASKED FOR THE RIGHT TO SEIZE FARMS THROUGH CONDEMNATION AND RESELL THEM TO OTHER INDIVIDUALS
YOU1000000101_S0000074	AND CONTAINED IN THAT SAME PROGRAM WAS A PROVISION THAT WOULD HAVE ALLOWED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO REMOVE TWO MILLION FARMERS FROM THE SOIL
YOU1000000101_S0000075	AT THE SAME TIME THERE'S BEEN AN INCREASE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE EMPLOYEES THERE'S NOW ONE FOR EVERY THIRTY FARMS IN THE UNITED STATES
YOU1000000101_S0000076	AND STILL THEY CAN'T TELL US HOW SIXTY SIX SHIPLOADS OF GRAIN HEADED FOR AUSTRIA DISAPPEARED WITHOUT A TRACE AND BILLY SALESTS NEVER LEFT SHORE
YOU1000000101_S0000078	EVERY RESPONSIBLE FARMER AND FARM ORGANIZATION HAS REPEATEDLY ASKED THE GOVERNMENT TO FREE THE FARM ECONOMY
YOU1000000101_S0000079	BUT HOW WHO ARE FARMERS TO KNOW WHAT'S BEST FOR THEM
YOU1000000101_S0000080	THE WHEAT FARMERS VOTED AGAINST A WHEAT PROGRAM THE GOVERNMENT PASSED IT ANYWAY NOW THE PRICE OF BREAD GOES UP THE PRICE OF WHEAT TO THE FARMER GOES DOWN
YOU1000000101_S0000081	MEANWHILE BACK IN THE CITY UNDER URBAN RENEWAL THE ASSAULT ON FREEDOM CARRIES ON
YOU1000000101_S0000083	PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS SO DELUDED THAT PUBLIC INTEREST IS ALMOST ANYTHING A FEW GOVERNMENT PLANNERS DECIDE IT SHOULD BE IN A PROGRAM THAT TAKES FROM THE NEEDY AND GIVES TO THE GREEDY
YOU1000000101_S0000084	WE SEE SUCH SPECTACLES AS IN CLEVELAND OHIO A MILLION AND A HALF DOLLARS BUILDING COMPLETED ONLY THREE YEARS AGO MUST BE DESTROYED
YOU1000000101_S0000085	TO MAKE WAY FOR WHAT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS CALL A MORE COMPATIBLE USE OF THE LAND
YOU1000000101_S0000086	THE PRESIDENT TELLS US HE'S NOW GOING TO START BUILDING PUBLIC HOUSING UNITS IN THE THOUSANDS WHE'RE HERETOFORE WE'VE ONLY BUILT THEM IN THE HUNDREDS
YOU1000000101_S0000087	BUT FHA AND THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION TELL US THEY HAVE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND HOUSING UNITS THEY'VE TAKEN BACK THROUGH MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE
YOU1000000101_S0000088	FOR THREE DECADES WE'VE SOUGHT TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF UNEMPLOYMENT THROUGH GOVERNMENT PLANNING AND THE MORE THE PLANS FAIL THE MORE THE PLANNERS PLAN
YOU1000000101_S0000089	THE LATEST IS THE AREA REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY
YOU1000000101_S0000090	THEY'VE JUST DECLARED RICE COUNTY KANSAS A DEPRESSED AREA
YOU1000000101_S0000091	RICE COUNTY KANSAS HAS TWO HUNDRED OIL WELLS AND THE FOURTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE THERE HAVE OVER THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ON DEPOSIT IN PERSONAL SAVINGS IN THEIR BANKS
YOU1000000101_S0000093	WHEN THE GOVERNMENT TELLS YOU YOU'RE DEPRESSED LIE DOWN AND BE DEPRESSED
YOU1000000101_S0000094	WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO CAN'T SEE A FAT MAN STANDING BESIDE A THIN ONE WITHOUT COMING TO THE CONCLUSION THE FAT MAN GOT THAT WAY BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE THIN ONE
YOU1000000101_S0000095	SO THEY'RE GOING TO SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS OF HUMAN MISERY THROUGH GOVERNMENT AND GOVERNMENT PLANNING
YOU1000000101_S0000096	WELL NOW IF GOVERNMENT PLANNING AND WELFARE HAD THE ANSWER
YOU1000000101_S0000097	AND THEY'VE HAD ALMOST THIRTY YEARS OF IT SHOULDN'T WE EXPECT GOVERNMENT TO READ THE SCORE TO US ONCE IN A WHILE
YOU1000000101_S0000098	SOULDN'T THEY BE TELLING US ABOUT THE DECLINE EACH YEAR IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE NEEDING HELP
YOU1000000101_S0000099	THE REDUCTION IN THE NEED FOR PUBLIC HOUSING BUT THE REVERSE IS TRUE EACH YEAR THE NEED GROWS GREATER THE PROGRAM GROWS GREATER
YOU1000000101_S0000101	WE WERE TOLD FOUR YEARS AGO THAT SEVENTEEN MILLION PEOPLE WENT TO BED HUNGRY EACH NIGHT WELL THAT WAS PROBABLY TRUE THEY WERE ALL ON A DIET
YOU1000000101_S0000104	UT NOW WE'RE TOLD THAT NINE POINT THREE MILLION FAMILIES IN THIS COUNTRY ARE POVERTY STRICKEN ON THE BASIS OF EARNING LESS THAN THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR
YOU1000000101_S0000105	WELFARE SPENDING TEN TIMES GREATER THAN IT WAS IN THE DARK DEPTHS OF THE DEPRESSION
YOU1000000101_S0000106	WE'RE SPENDING FORTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS ON WELFARE
YOU1000000101_S0000107	NOW DO A LITTLE ARITHMETIC AND YOU'LL FIND THAT IF WE DIVIDED THE FORTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS UP EQUALLY AMONG THOSE NINE MILLION POOR FAMILIES
YOU1000000101_S0000108	WE'D BE ABLE TO GIVE EACH FAMILY FORTY SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR AND THIS ADDED TO THEIR PRESENT INCOME SHOULD ELIMINATE POVERTY
YOU1000000101_S0000110	DIRECT AID TO THE POOR HOWEVER IS ONLY RUNNING ABOUT SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS PER FAMILY IT WOULD SEEM THAT SOME PLACE THERE MUST BE SOME OVERHEAD
YOU1000000101_S0000112	NOW
YOU1000000101_S0000114	O NOW WE DECLARE WAR ON POVERTY OR YOU TOO CAN BE A BOBBY BAKER
YOU1000000101_S0000116	O DO THEY HONESTLY EXPECT US TO BELIEVE THAT IF WE ADD ONE BILLION DOLLARS TO THE FORTY FIVE BILLION WE'RE SPENDING ONE MORE PROGRAM TO THE THIRTY ODD WE HAVE
YOU1000000101_S0000117	AND REMEMBER THIS NEW PROGRAM DOESN'T REPLACE ANY IT JUST DUPLICATES EXISTING PROGRAMS DO THEY BELIEVE THAT POVERTY IS SUDDENLY GOING TO DISAPPEAR BY MAGIC
YOU1000000101_S0000118	WELL IN ALL FAIRNESS I SHOULD EXPLAIN THERE IS ONE PART OF THE NEW PROGRAM THAT ISN'T DUPLICATED THIS IS THE YOUTH FEATURE WE'RE NOW GOING TO SOLVE THE DROPOUT PROBLEM JUVENALE DELINQUENCY
YOU1000000101_S0000119	BY REINSTITUTING SOMETHING LIKE THE OLD CCC CAMPS AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE IN THESE CAMPS
YOU1000000101_S0000120	BUT AGAIN WE DO SOME ARITHMETIC AND WE FIND THAT WE'RE GOING TO SPEND EACH YEAR JUST ON ROOM AND BOARD FOR EACH YOUNG PERSON WE HELP FORTY SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR
YOU1000000101_S0000121	WE CAN SEND THEM TO HARVARD FOR TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED
YOU1000000101_S0000123	COURSE DON'T GET ME WRONG I'M NOT SUGGESTING HARVARD IS THE ANSWER TO JUVENILE DELINQUENCY
YOU1000000101_S0000125	SERIOUSLY WHAT ARE WE DOING TO THOSE WE SEEK TO HELP
YOU1000000101_S0000127	NOT TOO LONG AGO A JUDGE CALLED ME HERE IN LOS ANGELES
YOU1000000101_S0000128	HE TOLD ME OF A YOUNG WOMAN WHO'D COME BEFORE HIM FOR A DIVORCE
YOU1000000101_S0000129	SHE HAD SIX CHILDREN WAS PREGNANT WITH HER SEVENTH UNDER HIS QUESTIONING SHE REVEALED HER HUSBAND WAS A LABOURER EARNING TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS A MONTH
YOU1000000101_S0000130	SHE WANTED THE DIVORCE TO GET AN EIGHTY DOLLARS RAISE SHE'S ELIGIBLE FOR THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY DOLLARS A MONTH IN THE AID TO DEPENDET CHILDREN PROGRAM
YOU1000000101_S0000131	SHE GOT THE IDEA FROM TWO WOMEN IN HER NEIGHBORHOOD WHO'D ALREADY DONE THAT VERY THING
YOU1000000101_S0000132	YET ANY TIME YOU AND I QUESTION THE SCHEMES OF THE DO GOODERS WE'RE DENOUNCED AS BEING AGAINST THEIR HUMANITARIAN GOALS THEY SAY WE'RE ALWAYS AGAINST THINGS WE'RE NEVER FOR ANYTHING
YOU1000000101_S0000133	WELL THE TROUBLE WITH OUR LIBERAL FRIENDS IS NOT THAT THEY'RE IGNORANT IT'S JUST THAT THEY KNOW SO MUCH THAT ISN'T SO NOW
YOU1000000101_S0000135	WE'RE FOR A PROVISION THET DESTITUTION SHOULD NOT FOLLOW UNEMPLOYMENT BY REASON OF OLD AGE AND TO THAT END WE HAVE ACCEPTED SOCIAL SECURITY AS A STEP TOWARD MEETING THE PROBLEM
YOU1000000101_S0000136	BUT WE'RE AGAINST THOSE ENTRUSTED WITH THIS PROGRAM WHEN THEY PRACTICE DECEPTION REGARDING ITS FISCAL SHORTCOMINGS
YOU1000000101_S0000137	WHEN THEY CHARGE THAT ANY CRITICISM OF THE PROGRAM MEANS THAT WE WANT TO END PAYMENTS TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO DEPEND ON THEM FOR A LIVELIHOOD
YOU1000000101_S0000138	THEY'VE CALLED IT INSURANCE TO US IN A HUNDRED MILLION PIECES OF LITERATURE BUT THEN THEY APPEARED BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT AND THEY TESTIFIED IT WAS A WELFARE PROGRAM
YOU1000000101_S0000139	THEY ONLY USED THE TERM INSURANCE TO SELL IT TO THE PEOPLE AND THEY SAID SOCIAL SECURITY DUES ARE A TAX FOR THE GENERAL USE OF THE GOVERNMENT
YOU1000000101_S0000140	AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS USED THAT TAX THERE IS NO FUND BECAUSE ROBERT BYERS THE ACTUARIAL HEAD APPEARED BEFORE A CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE
YOU1000000101_S0000141	AND ADMITTED THAT SOCIAL SECURITY AS OF THIS MOMENT IS TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN THE HOLE
YOU1000000101_S0000142	BUT HE SAID THERE SHOULD BE NO CAUSE FOR WORRY BECAUSE AS LONG AS THEY HAD THE POWER TO TAX THEY COULD ALWAYS TAKE AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE WHATEVER THEY NEEDED TO BAIL THEM OUT OF TROUBLE
YOU1000000101_S0000143	AND THEY'RE DOING JUST THAT A YOUNG MAN TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE WORKING AT AN AVERAGE SALARY
YOU1000000101_S0000144	HIS SOCIAL SECURITY CONTRIBUTION WOULD IN THE OPEN MARKET BUY HIM AN INSURANCE POLICY THAT WOULD GUARANTEE TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS A MONTH
YOU1000000101_S0000145	AT AGE SIXTY FIVE THE GOVERNMENT PROMISES A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN HE COULD LIVE IT UP UNTIL HE'S THIRTY ONE AND THEN TAKE OUT A POLICY THAT WOULD PAY MORE THAN SOCIAL SECURITY
YOU1000000101_S0000146	NOW ARE WE SO LACKING IN BUSINESS SENSE THAT WE CAN'T PUT THIS PROGRAM ON A SOUND BASIS
YOU1000000101_S0000147	SO THAT PEOPLE WHO DO REQUIRE THOSE PAYMENTS WILL FIND THEY CAN GET THEM WHEN THEY'RE DUE THAT THE CUBBOARD ISN'T BARE BERRY GOLDWATER THINKS WE CAN
YOU1000000101_S0000148	AT THE SAME TIME CAN'T WE INTRODUCE VOLUNTARY FEATURES THAT WOULD PERMIT A CITIZEN WHO COUL DO BETTER ON HIS OWN
YOU1000000101_S0000149	TO BE EXCUSED UPON PRESENTATION OF EVIDENCE THAT HE HAD MADE PROVISION FOR THE NON EARNING YEARS
YOU1000000101_S0000150	SHOULD WE NOT ALLOW A WIDOW WITH CHILDREN TO WORK AND NOT LOSE THE BENEFITS SUPPOSEDLY PAID FOR BY HER DECEASED HUSBAND
YOU1000000101_S0000151	SHOULDN'T YOU AND I BE ALLOWED TO DECLARE WHO OUR BENEFICIARIES WILL BE UNDER THIS PROGRAM WHICH WE CANNOT DO
YOU1000000101_S0000152	I THINK WE'RE FORETELLING OUR SENIOR CITIZENS THAT NO ONE IN THIS COUNTRY SHOULD BE DENIED MEDICAL CARE BECAUSE OF A LACK OF FUNDS
YOU1000000101_S0000154	BUT I THINK WE'RE AGAINST FORCING ALL CITIZENS REGARDLESS OF NEED INTO A COMPULSORY GOVERNMENT PROGRAM
YOU1000000101_S0000155	ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE SUCH EXAMPLES AS WAS ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK WHEN FRANCE ADMITTED THAT THEIR MEDICARE PROGRAM IS NOW BANKRUPT THEY'VE COME TO THE END OF THE ROAD
YOU1000000101_S0000156	IN ADDITION WAS BARRY GOLDWATER SO IRRESPONSIBLE WHEN HE SUGGESTED THAT OUR GOVERNMENT GIVE UP ITS PROGRAM OF DELIBERATE PLANNED INFLATION
YOU1000000101_S0000157	SO THAT WHEN YOU DO GET YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY PENSION A DOLLAR WILL BUY A DOLLAR'S WORTH AND NOT FORTY FIVE CENTS WORTH
YOU1000000101_S0000159	I THINK WE'RE FORAN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION WHERE THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD CAN SEEK PEACE
YOU1000000101_S0000160	BUT I THINK WE'RE AGAINST SUBORDINATING AMERICAN INTERESTS TO AN ORGANIZATION THAT HAS BECOME SO STRUCTURALLY UNSOUND
YOU1000000101_S0000161	THAT TODAY YOU CAN MUSTER A TWO THIRDS VOTE ON THE FLOOR OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY AMONG NATIONS THAT REPRESENT LESS THAN TEN PERCENT OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION
YOU1000000101_S0000162	I THINK WE'RE AGAINST THE HYPOCRISY OF ASSAILING OUR ALLIES BECAUSE HERE AND THERE THEY CLING TO A COLONY
YOU1000000101_S0000163	WHILE WE ENGAGE IN A CONSPIRACY OF SILENCE AND NEVER OPEN OUR MOUTHS ABOUT THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ENSLAVED IN THE SOVIET COLONIES IN THE SATELLITE NATIONS
YOU1000000101_S0000165	I THINK WE'RE FOR ADING OUR ALLIES BY SHARING OF OUR MATERIAL BLESSINGS WITH THOSE NATIONS WHICH SHARE IN OUR FUNDAMENTAL BELIEFS
YOU1000000101_S0000166	BUT WE'RE AGAINST DOWLING OUT MONEY GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT CREATING BUREAUCRACY IF NOT SOCIALISM ALL OVER THE WORLD
YOU1000000101_S0000167	WE SET OUT TO HELP NINETEEN COUNTRIES WE'RE HELPING A HUNDRED AND SEVEN WEV SPENT A HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS
YOU1000000101_S0000168	WITH THAT MONEY WE'E BOUGHT A TWO MILLION DOLLARS YACHT FOR HILE SALASI WE BOUGHT DRESS SUITS FOR GREEK UNDERTAKERS EXTRA WIVES FOR KENYA GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS
YOU1000000101_S0000169	WE BOUGHT A THOUSAND TV SETS FOR A PLACE WHERE THEY HAVE NO ELECTRICITY
YOU1000000101_S0000171	IN THE LAST SIX YEARS FIFTY TWO NATIONS HAVE BOUGHT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF OUR GOLD AND ALL FIFTY TWO ARE RECEIVING FOREIGN AID FROM THIS COUNTRY
YOU1000000101_S0000173	NO GOVERNMENT EVER VOLUNTARILY REDUCES ITSELF IN SIZE SO GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS ONCE LAUNCHED NEVER DISAPPEAR
YOU1000000101_S0000174	ACTUALLY A GOVERNMENT BUREAU IS THE NEAREST THING TO ETERNAL LIFE WE'LL EVER SEE ON THIS EARTH
YOU1000000101_S0000176	FEDERAL EMPLOYEES FEDERAL EMPLOYEES NUMBER TWO AND A HALF MILLION AND FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL ONE OUT OF SIX OF THE NATION'S WORKFORCE EMPLOYED BY GOVERNMENT
YOU1000000101_S0000177	THESE PROLIFERATING BUREAUS WITH THEIR THOUSANDS OF REGULATIONS HAVE COST US MANY OF OUR CONSTITUTIONAL SAFEGUARDS
YOU1000000101_S0000178	HOW MANY OF US REALIZE THAT TODAY FEDERAL AGENTS CAN INVADE A MAN'S PROPERTY WITHOUT A WARRANT THEY CAN IMPOSE A FINE WITHOUT A FORMAL HEARING LET ALONE A TRIAL BY JURY
YOU1000000101_S0000179	AND THEY CAN SEIZE AND SELL HIS PROPERTY AT AUCTION TO ENFORCE THE PAYMENT OF THAT FINE
YOU1000000101_S0000180	IN CHICO COUNTY ARKANSAS JAMES WEER OVERPLANTED HIS RICE ALLOTMENT THE GOVERNMENT OBTAINED A SEVENTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS JUDGMENT
YOU1000000101_S0000181	AND A U S MARSHAL SOLD HIS NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ACRE FARM AT AUCTION THE GOVERNMENT SAID IT WAS NECESSARY AS A WARNING TO OTHERS TO MAKE THE SYSTEM WORK
YOU1000000101_S0000183	LAST FEBRUARY NINETEENTH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA NORMAN THOMAS SIX TIMES CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT ON THE SOCIALIST PARTY TICKET SAID IF BARRY GOLDWATER BECAME PRESIDENT
YOU1000000101_S0000184	HE WOULD STOP THE ADVANCE OF SOCIALISM IN THE UNITED STATES I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE WILL DO
YOU1000000101_S0000186	BUT AS A FORMER DEMOCRAT I CAN TELL YOU NORMAN THOMAS ISN'T THE ONLY MAN WHO HAS DRAWN THIS PARALLEL TO SOCIALISM WITH THE PRESENT ADMINISTRATION
YOU1000000101_S0000187	BECAUSE BACK IN NINETEEN THIRTY SIX MR DEMOCRAT HIMSELF ALE SMITH A GREAT AMERICAN CAME BEFORE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
YOU1000000101_S0000188	AND CHARGED THAT THE LEADERSHIP OF HIS PARTY WAS TAKING THE PARTY OF JEFFERSON JACKSON AND CLEVELAND DOWN THE ROAD UNDER THE BANNERS OF MARXS LENNON AND STALEN
YOU1000000101_S0000189	AND HE WALKED AWAY FROM HIS PARTY AND HE NEVER RETURNED TILL THE DAY HE DIED
YOU1000000101_S0000190	BECAUSE TO THIS DAY THE LEADERSHIP OF THAT PARTY HAS BEEN TAKING THAT PARTY THAT HONORABLE PARTY DOWN THE ROAD IN THE IMAGE OF THE LABOR SOCIALIST PARTY OF ENGLAND
YOU1000000101_S0000191	NOW IT DOESN'T REQUIRE EXPROPRIATION OR CONFISCATION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY OR BUSINESS TO IMPOSE SOCIALISM ON A PEOPLE
YOU1000000101_S0000192	WHAT DOES IT MEAN WHETHER YOU HOLD THE DEED TO THE OR THE TITLE TO YOUR BUSINESS OR PROPERTY IF THE GOVERNMENT HOLDS THE POWER OF LIFE AND DEATH
YOU1000000101_S0000193	OVER THAT BUSINESS OR PROPERTY AND SUCH MACHINERY ALREADY EXISTS
YOU1000000101_S0000194	THE GOVERNMENT CAN FIND SOME CHARGE TO BRING AGAINST ANY CONCERN IT CHOOSES TO PROSECUTE EVERY BUSINESS MAN HAS HIS OWN TALE OF HARASSMENT
YOU1000000101_S0000195	SOMEWHERE A PORVERSION HAS TAKEN PLACE OUR NATURAL UNALIENABLE RIGHTS ARE NOW CONSIDERED TO BE A DISPENSATION OF GOVERNMENT
YOU1000000101_S0000196	AND FREEDOM HAS NEVER BEEN SO FRAGILE SO CLOSE TO SLIPPING FROM OUR GRASP AS IT IS AT THIS MOMENT
YOU1000000101_S0000197	OUR DEMOCRATIC OPPONENTS SEEM UNWILLING TO DEBATE THESE ISSUES THEY WANT TO MAKE YOU AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A CONTEST BETWEEN TWO MEN
YOU1000000101_S0000198	THAT WE'RE TO CHOOSE JUST BETWEEN TWO PERSONALITIES WELL WHAT OF THIS MAN THAT THEY WOULD DESTROY
YOU1000000101_S0000199	AND IN DESTROYING THEY WOULD DESTROY THAT WHICH HE REPRESENTS THE IDEAS THAT YOU AND I HOLD DEAR
YOU1000000101_S0000201	IS HE THE BRASH AND SHALLOW AND TRIGGER HAPPY MAN THEY SAY HE IS
YOU1000000101_S0000202	WELL I'VE BEEN PRIVILEGED TO KNOW HIM WHEN I KNEW HIM LONG BEFORE HE EVER DREAMED OF TRYING FOR HIGH OFFICE
YOU1000000101_S0000203	AND I CAN TELL YOU PERSONALLY I'VE NEVER KNOWN A MAN IN MY LIFE I BELIEVED SO INCAPABLE OF DOING A DISHONEST OR DISHONORABLE THING
YOU1000000101_S0000205	THIS IS A MAN WHO IN HIS OWN BUSINESS BEFORE HE ENTERED POLITICS INSTITUTED A PROFIT SHARING PLAN BEFORE UNIONS HAD EVER THOUGHT OF IT
YOU1000000101_S0000206	HE PUT IN HEALTH AND MEDICAL INSURANCE FOR ALL HIS EMPLOYEES HE TOOK FIFTY PERCENT OF THE PROFITS BEFORE TAXES
YOU1000000101_S0000207	AND SET UP A RETIREMENT PROGRAM A PENSION PLAN FOR ALL HIS EMPLOYEES
YOU1000000101_S0000208	HE SENTD MONTHLY CHECKS FOR LIFE TO AN EMPLOYEE WHO AS ILL AND COULDN'T WORK HE PROVIDES NURSING CARE FOR THE CHILDREN OF MOTHERS WHO WORK IN THE STORES
YOU1000000101_S0000210	WHEN MEXICO WAS RAVAGED BY THE FLOODS IN THE RIO GRAND HE CLIMBED IN HIS AIRPLANE AND FLEW MEXFLEW MEDICINE AND SUPPLIES DOWN THERE
YOU1000000101_S0000211	AN X GI TOLD ME HOW HE MET HIM
YOU1000000101_S0000212	IT WAS THE WEEK BEFORE CHRISTMAS DURING THE KOREAN WAR AND HE WAS AT THE LOS ANGELES AIRPORT TRYING TO GET A RIDE HOME TO ARIZONA FOR CHRISTMAS
YOU1000000101_S0000214	AND HE SAID THAT A LOT OF SERVICE MEN THERE AND NO SEATS AVAILABLE ON THE PLANES
YOU1000000101_S0000215	AND THEN A VOICE CAME OVER THE LOUD SPEAKER AND SAID ANY MEN IN UNIFORM WANTING A RIDE TO ARIZONA GO TO RUNWAY SUCH AND SUCH
YOU1000000101_S0000216	AND THEY WENT DOWN THERE THERE WAS A FELLOW NAMED BARRY GOLDWATER SITTING IN HIS PLANE
YOU1000000101_S0000217	EVERY DAY IN THOSE WEEKS BEFORE CHRISTMAS ALL DAY LONG HE'D LOAD UP THE PLANE FLY IT TO ARIZONA FLY THEM TO THEIR HOMES FLY BACK OVER TO GET ANOTHER LOAD
YOU1000000101_S0000219	DURING THE HECTIC SPLIT SECOND TIMING OF A CAMPAIGN THIS IS A MAN WHO TOOK TIME OUT TO SIT BESIDE AN OLD FRIEND WHO WAS DYING OF CANCER
YOU1000000101_S0000220	HIS CAMPAIGN MANAGERS WERE UNDERSTANDABLY IMPATIENT BUT HE SAID THERE AREN'T MANY LEFT WHO CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO HER I'D LIKE HER TO KNOW I CARE
YOU1000000101_S0000221	THIS IS A MAN WHO SAID TO HIS NINETEEN YEAR OLD SON THERE IS NO FOUNDATION LIKE THE ROCK OF HONESTY AND FAIRNESS
YOU1000000101_S0000222	AND WHEN YOU BEGIN TO BUILD YOUR LIFE ON THAT ROCK WITH THE CEMENT OF THE FAITH IN GOD THAT YOU HAVE THEN YOU HAVE A REAL START
YOU1000000101_S0000224	THIS IS NOT A MAN WHO COULD CARELESSLY SEND OTHER PEOPLE'S SONS TO WAR
YOU1000000101_S0000226	THAT IS THE ISSUE OF THIS CAMPAIGN THAT MAKES ALL THE OTHER PROBLEMS I'VE DISCUSSED ACADEMIC UNLESS WE REALIZE WE'RE IN A WAR THAT MUST BE WON
YOU1000000101_S0000228	THOSE WHO WOULD TRADE OUR FREEDOM FOR THE SOUP KITCHEN OF THE WELFARE STATE HAVE TOLD US THEY HAVE A UTOPIAN SOLUTION OF PEACE WITHOUT VICTORY THEY CALL THEIR POLICY ACCOMMODATION
YOU1000000101_S0000229	AND THEY SAY IF WE'LL ONLY AVOID ANY DIRECT CONFRONTATION WITH THE ENEMY HE'LL FORGET HIS EVIL WAYS AND LEARN TO LOVE US
YOU1000000101_S0000230	ALL WHO OPPOSE THEM ARE INDICTED AS WARMONGERS THEY SAY WE OFFER SIMPLE ANSWERS TO COMPLEX PROBLEMS
YOU1000000101_S0000231	WELL PERHAPS THERE IS A SIMPLE ANSWER NOT AN EASY ANSWER BUT SIMPLE IF YOU AND I HAVE THE COURAGE TO TELL OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS
YOU1000000101_S0000232	THAT WE WANT OUR NATIONAL POLICY BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW IN OUR HEARTS IS MORALLY RIGHT WE CANNOT BUY OUR SECURITY OUR FREEDOM FROM THE THREAT OF THE BOMB
YOU1000000101_S0000234	BY COMMITTING AN IMMORALITY SO GREAT AS SAYING TO A BILLION HUMAN BEINGS NOW ENSLAVED BEHIND THE IRON CURTAIN GIVE UP YOUR DREAMS OF FREEDOM
YOU1000000101_S0000235	BECAUSE TO SAVE OUR OWN SKINS WE'RE WILLING TO MAKE A DEAL WITH YOUR SLAVE MASTERS
YOU1000000101_S0000236	ALEXANDER HAMILTON SAID A NATION WHICH CAN PREFER DISGRACE TO DANGER IS PREPARED FOR A MASTER AND DESERVES ONE
YOU1000000101_S0000237	NOW LET'S SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT THERE'S NO ARGUMENT OVER THE CHOICE BETWEEN PEACE AND WAR
YOU1000000101_S0000238	BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE GUARANTEED WAY YOU CAN HAVE PEACE AND YOU CAN HAVE IT IN THE NEXT SECOND SURRENDER
YOU1000000101_S0000239	ADMITTEDLY THERE'S A RISK IN ANY COURSE WE FOLLOW OTHER THAN THIS BUT EVERY LESSON OF HISTORY TELLS US THAT THE GREATER RISK LIES IN APPEASEMENT
YOU1000000101_S0000240	AND THIS IS THE SPECTORE OUR WELL MEANING LIBERAL FRIENDS REFUSE TO FACE THAT THEIR POLICY OF ACCOMMODATION IS APPEASEMENT
YOU1000000101_S0000241	AND IT GIVES NO CHOICE BETWEEN PEACE AND WAR ONLY BETWEEN FIGHT OR SURRENDER
YOU1000000101_S0000242	IF WE CONTINUE TO ACCOMMODATE CONTINUE TO BACK AND RETREAT EVENTUALLY WE HAVE TO FACE THE FINAL DEMAND THE ULTIMATUM AND WHAT THEN
YOU1000000101_S0000243	WHEN NEKITE KRUSCTEF HAS TOLD HIS PEOPLE HE KNOWS WHAT OUR ANSWER WILL BE
YOU1000000101_S0000244	HE HAS TOLD THEM THAT WE'RE RETREATING UNDER THE PRESSURE OF THE COLD WAR AND SOME DAY WHEN THE TIME COMES TO DELIVER THE FINAL ULTIMATUM
YOU1000000101_S0000245	OUR SURRENDER WILL BE VOLUNTARY BECAUSE BY THAT TIME WE WILL HAVE BEEN WEAKENED FROM WITHIN SPIRITUALLY MORALLY AND ECONOMICALLY
YOU1000000101_S0000246	HE BELIEVES THIS BECAUSE FROM OUR SIDE HE'S HEARD VOICES PLEADING FOR PEACE AT ANY PRICE OR BETTER READ THAN DEAD
YOU1000000101_S0000247	OR AS ONE COMMENTATOR PUT IT HE'D RATHER LIVE ON HIS KNEES THAN DIE ON HIS FEET AND THEREIN LIES THE ROAD TO WAR BECAUSE THOSE VOICES DON'T SPEAK FOR THE REST OF US
YOU1000000101_S0000248	YOU AND I KNOW AND DO NOT BELIEVE THAT LIFE IS SO DEAR AND PEACE SO SWEET AS TO BE PURCHASED AT THE PRICE OF CHAINS AND SLAVERY
YOU1000000101_S0000249	IF NOTHING IN LIFE IS WORTH DYING FOR WHEN DID THIS BEGIN JUST IN THE FACE OF THIS ENEMY OR SHOULD MOSES HAVE TOLD THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL TO LIVE IN SLAVERY UNDER THE PHARAOHS
YOU1000000101_S0000251	SHOULD CHRIST HAVE REFUSED THE CROSS SOULD THE PATRIOTS AT CONQUERED BRIDGE HAVE THROWN DOWN THEIR GUNS AND REFUSED TO FIRE THE SHOT HEARD ROUND THE WORLD
YOU1000000101_S0000253	THE MARTARS OF HISTORY WERE NOT FOOLS AND OUR HONORED DEAD WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES TO STOP THE ADVANCE OF THE NAZIS DIDN'T DIE IN VAIN
YOU1000000101_S0000255	WHERE THEN IS THE ROAD TO PEACE WELL IT'S A SIMPLE ANSWER AFTER ALL
YOU1000000101_S0000256	YOU AND I HAVE THE COURAGE TO SAY TO OUR ENEMIES THERE IS A PRICE WE WILL NOT PAY THERE IS A POINT BEYOND WHICH THEY MUST NOT ADVANCE
YOU1000000101_S0000258	THIS
YOU1000000101_S0000260	THIS IS THE MEANING IN THE PHRASE OF BERRY GOLDWATER PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH
YOU1000000101_S0000261	WINSTON CHURCHILL SAID THE DESTINY OF MAN IS NOT MEASURED BY MATERIAL COMPUTATIONS WHEN GREAT FORCES ARE ON THE MOVE IN THE WORLD WE LEARN WE'RE SPIRITS NOT ANIMALS
YOU1000000101_S0000262	AND HE SAID THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON IN TIME AND SPACE AND BEYOND TIME AND SPACE WHICH WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT SPELLS DUTY

YOU1000000102_S0000081	I'M HONORED TO BE WITH YOU TODAY FOR YOUR COMMENCEMENT FROM ONE OF THE FINEST UNIVERSITIES IN THE WORLD
YOU1000000102_S0000083	TRUTH BE TOLD
YOU1000000102_S0000085	I NEVER GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE AND THIS IS THE CLOSEST I'VE EVER GOTTEN TO A COLLEGE GRADUATION
YOU1000000102_S0000087	TODAY I WANT TO TELL YOU THREE STORIES FROM MY LIFE THAT'S IT NO BIG DEAL JUST THREE STORIES
YOU1000000102_S0000089	THE FIRST STORY IS ABOUT CONNECTING THE DOTS
YOU1000000102_S0000091	I DROPPED OUT OF REED COLLEGE AFTER THE FIRST SIX MONTHS BUT THEN STAYED AROUND AS A DROPIN FOR ANOTHER EIGHTEEN MONTHS OR SO BEFORE I REALLY QUIT
YOU1000000102_S0000093	SO WHY DUD I DROP OUT
YOU1000000102_S0000095	IT STARTED BEFORE I WAS BORN
YOU1000000102_S0000097	MY BIOLOGICAL MOTHER WAS A YOUNG UNWED GRADUATE STUDENT AND SHE DECIDED TO PUT ME UP FOR ADOPTION
YOU1000000102_S0000098	SHE FELT VERY STRONGLY THAT I SHOULD BE ADOPTED BY COLLEGE GRADUATES SO EVERYTHING WAS ALL SET FOR ME TO BE ADOPTED AT BIRTH BY A LAWYER AND HIS WIFE
YOU1000000102_S0000100	EXCEPT THAT WHEN I POPPED OUT THEY DECIDED AT THE LAST MINUTE THAT THEY REALLY WANTED A GIRL
YOU1000000102_S0000102	SO MY PARENTS WHO WERE ON A WAITING LIST GOT A CALL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT ASKING WE'VE GOT AN UNEXPECTED BABY BOY DO YOU WANT HIM
YOU1000000102_S0000103	THEY SAID OF COURSE
YOU1000000102_S0000105	MY BIOLOGICAL MOTHER FOUND OUT LATER THAT MY MOTHER HAD NEVER GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE AND THAT MY FATHER HAD NEVER GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL
YOU1000000102_S0000106	SHE REFUSED TO SIGN THE FINAL ADOPTION PAPERS
YOU1000000102_S0000108	SHE ONLY RELENTED A FEW MONTHS LATER WHEN MY PARENTS PROMISED THAT I WOULD GO TO COLLEGE THIS WAS THE START IN MY LIFE
YOU1000000102_S0000110	AND SEVENTEEN YEARS LATER I DID GO TO COLLEGE BUT I NAIVELY CHOSE A COLLEGE THAT WAS ALMOST AS EXPENSIVE AS STANFORD
YOU1000000102_S0000111	AND ALL OF MY WORKINGCLASS PARENTS SAVINGS WERE BEING SPENT ON MY COLLEGE TUITION AFTER SIX MONTHS I COULDN'T SEE THE VALUE IN IT
YOU1000000102_S0000112	I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WANTED TO DO WITH MY LIFE AND NO IDEA HOW COLLEGE WAS GOING TO HELP ME FIGURE IT OUT
YOU1000000102_S0000113	AND HERE I WAS SPENDING ALL THE MONEY MY PARENTS HAD SAVED THEIR ENTIRE LIFE
YOU1000000102_S0000115	SO I DECIDED TO DROP OUT AND TRUST THAT IT WOULD ALL WORK OUT OKAY IT WAS PRETTY SCARY AT THE TIME BUT LOOKING BACK IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST DECISIONS I EVER MADE
YOU1000000102_S0000117	THE MINUTE I DROPPED OUT I COULD STOP TAKING THE REQUIRED CLASSES THAT DIDN'T INTEREST ME AND BEGIN DROPPING IN ON THE ONES THAT LOOKED FAR MORE INTERESTING
YOU1000000102_S0000119	IT WASN'T ALL ROMANTIC I DIDN'T HAVE A DORM ROOM SO I SLEPT ON THE FLOOR IN FRIENDS ROOMS I RETURNED COAKE BOTTLES FOR THE FIVE CENT DEPOSITS TO BUY FOOD WITH
YOU1000000102_S0000120	AND I WOULD WALK THE SEVEN MILES ACROSS TOWN EVERY SUNDAY NIGHT TO GET ONE GOOD MEAL A WEEK AT THE HARRI KRISHNA TEMPLE
YOU1000000102_S0000122	I LOVED IT AND MUCH OF WHAT I STUMBLED INTO BY FOLLOWING MY CURIOSITY AND INTUITION TURNED OUT TO BE PRICELESS LATER ON LET ME GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE
YOU1000000102_S0000124	READ COLLEGE AT THAT TIME OFFERED PERHAPS THE BEST CALLIGRAPHY INSTRUCTION IN THE COUNTRY
YOU1000000102_S0000125	THROUGHOUT THE CAMPUS EVERY POSTER EVERY LABEL ON EVERY DRAWER WAS BEAUTIFULLY HAND CALOGRAPHED BECAUSE I HAD DROPPED OUT
YOU1000000102_S0000126	AND DIDN'T HAVE TO TAKE THE NORMAL CLASSES I DECIDED TO TAKE A CALLIGRAPHY CLASS TO LEARN HOW TO DO THIS I LEARNED ABOUT SEREFF AND SAND SERIF TYPE FACES
YOU1000000102_S0000127	ABOUT VARYING THE AMOUNT OF SPACE BETWEEN DIFFERENT LETTER COMBINATIONS ABOUT WHAT MAKES GREAT TYPOGRAPHY GREAT
YOU1000000102_S0000129	IT WAS BEAUTIFUL HISTORICAL ARTISTICALLY SUBTLE IN A WAY THAT SCIENCE CAN'T CAPTURE AND I FOUND IT FASCINATING
YOU1000000102_S0000131	NONE OF THIS HAD EVEN A HOPE OF ANY PRACTICAL APPLICATION IN MY LIFE
YOU1000000102_S0000133	BUT TEN YEARS LATER WHEN WE WERE DESIGNING THE FIRST MACINTOSH COMPUTER IT ALL CAME BACK TO ME AND WE DESIGNED IT ALL INTO THE MAC
YOU1000000102_S0000134	IT WAS THE FIRST COMPUTER WITH BEAUTIFUL TYPOGRAPHY IF I HAD NEVER DROPPED IN ON THAT SINGLE COURSE IN COLLEGE
YOU1000000102_S0000135	THE MAC WOULD HAVE NEVER HAD MULTIPLE TYPEFACES OR PROPORTIONALLY SPACED FONTS AND SINCE WINDOWS JUST COPIED THE MAC IT'S LIKELY THAT NO PERSONAL COMPUTER WOULD HAVE HE
YOU1000000102_S0000137	IF I HAD NEVER DROPPED OUT I WOULD HAVE NEVER DROPPED IN ON THAT CALLIGRAPHY CLASS AND PERSONAL COMPUTERS MIGHT NOT HAVE THE WONDERFUL TYPOGRAPHY THAT THEY DO
YOU1000000102_S0000138	OF COURSE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONNECT THE DOTS LOOKING FORWARD WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE BUT IT WAS VERY VERY CLEAR LOOKING BACKWARDS TEN YEARS LATER
YOU1000000102_S0000139	AGAIN YOU CAN'T CONNECT THE DOTS LOOKING FORWARD YOU CAN ONLY CONNECT THEM LOOKING BACKWARDS SO YOU HAVE TO TRUST THAT THE DOTS WILL SOMEHOW CONNECT IN YOUR FUTURE
YOU1000000102_S0000140	YOU HAVE TO TRUST IN SOMETHING YOUR GUT DESTINY LIFE CARMA WHATEVER BECAUSE BELIEVING THAT THE DOTS WILL CON ECT
YOU1000000102_S0000141	DOWN THE ROAD WILL GIVE YOU THE CONFIDENCE TO FOLLOW YOUR HEART EVEN WHEN IT LEADS YOU OFF THE WELL WORN PATH AND THAT WILL MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE
YOU1000000102_S0000143	MY SECOND STORY IS ABOUT LOVE AND LOSS
YOU1000000102_S0000145	I WAS LUCKY I FOUND WHAT I LOVE TO DO EARLY IN LIFE WAS AND I STARTED APPLE IN MY PARENT' GARAGE WHEN I WAS TWENTY WE WORKED HARD
YOU1000000102_S0000146	AND IN TEN YEARS APPLE HAD GROWN FROM JUST A TWO OF US IN A GARAGE INTO A TWO BILLION DOLLARS COMPANY WITH OVER FOUR THOUSAND EMPLOYEES
YOU1000000102_S0000147	WE JUST RELEASED OUR FINEST CREATION THE MACINTOSH A YEAR EARLIER AND I'D JUST TURNED THIRTY
YOU1000000102_S0000149	AND THEN I GOT FIRED
YOU1000000102_S0000151	HOW CAN YOU GET FIRED FROM A COMPANY YOU STARTED
YOU1000000102_S0000153	WELL AS APPLE GREW WE HIRED SOMEONE WHO I THOUGHT WAS VERY TALENTED TO RUN THE COMPANY WITH ME AND FOR THE FIRST YEAR OR SO THINGS WENT WELL
YOU1000000102_S0000154	BUT THEN OUR VISIONS OF THE FUTURE BEGAN TO DIVERGE AND EVENTUALLY WE HAD A FALLING OUT WHEN WE DID OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS SIDED WITH HIM AND SO AT THIRTY I WAS OUT
YOU1000000102_S0000155	AND VERY PUBLICLY OUT WHAT HAD BEEN THE FOCUS OF MY ENTIRE ADULT LIFE WAS GONE AND IT WAS DEVASTATING
YOU1000000102_S0000157	I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO FOR A FEW MONTHS I FELT THAT IAD LET THE PREVIOUS GENERATION OF ENTREPRENEURS DOWN THAT I HAD DROPPED THE BATTON AS IT WAS BEING PASSED TO ME
YOU1000000102_S0000158	I MET WITH DAVID PACKARD AND BOB NOYSE AND TRIED TO APOLOGIZE FOR SCREWING UP SO BADLY
YOU1000000102_S0000160	I WAS A VERY PUBLIC FAILURE AND I EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT RUNNING AWAY FROM THE VALLEY BUT SOMETHING SLOWLY BEGAN TO DAWN ON ME I STILL LOVED WHAT I DID
YOU1000000102_S0000162	THE TURN OF EVENTS AT APPLE HAD NOT CHANGED THAT ONE BIT I'D BEEN REJECTED BUT I WAS STILL IN LOVE
YOU1000000102_S0000164	AND SO I DECIDED TO START OVER
YOU1000000102_S0000166	I DIDN'T SEE IT THEN BUT IT TURNED OUT THAT GETTING FIRED FROM APPLE WAS THE BEST THING THAT COULD HAVE EVER HAPPENED TO ME
YOU1000000102_S0000167	THE HEAVINESS OF BEING SUCCESSFUL WAS REPLACED BY THE LIGHTNESS OF BEING A BEGINNER AGAIN LESS SURE ABOUT EVERYTHING IT FREED ME TO ENTER ONE OF THE MOST CREATIVE PERIODS OF MY LIFE
YOU1000000102_S0000168	DURING THE NEXT FIVE YEARS I STARTED A COMPANY NAMED NEXT ANOTHER COMPANY NAMED PIXAR AND FELL IN LOVE WITH AN AMAZING WOMAN WHO WOULD BECOME MY WIFE
YOU1000000102_S0000169	PICKAR WENT ON TO CREATE THE WORLD'S FIRST COMPUTER ANIMATED FEATURE FILM TOY STORY AND IS NOW THE MOST SUCCESSFUL ANIMATION STUDIO IN THE WORLD
YOU1000000102_S0000171	IN A REMARKABLE TURN OF EVENTS APPLE BOUGHT NEXT AND I RETURNED TO APPLE AND THE TECHNOLOGY WE DEVELOPED IT NEXT IS AT THE HEART OF APPLE'S CURRENT RENAISSANCE
YOU1000000102_S0000172	AND LARENE AND I HAVE A WONDERFUL FAMILY TOGETHER
YOU1000000102_S0000174	I'M PRETTY SURE NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF I HADN'T BEEN FIRED FROM APPLE IT WAS AWFUL TASTING MEDICINE BUT I GUESS THE PATIENT NEEDED IT
YOU1000000102_S0000176	SOMETIME LIFE SOMETIMES LIFE'S GOING NA HIT YOU IN THE HEAD WITH A BRICK DON'T LOSE FAITH
YOU1000000102_S0000178	I'M CONVINCED THAT THE ONLY THING THAT KEPT ME GOING WAS THAT I LOVED WHAT I DID YOU'VE GOT TO FIND WAT YOU LOVE AND THAT IS AS TRUE FOR WORK AS IT IS FOR YOUR LOVERS
YOU1000000102_S0000179	YOUR WORK IS GOING TO FILL A LARGE PART OF YOUR LIFE AND THE ONLY WAY TO BE TRULY SATISFIED IS TO DO WHAT YOU BELIEVE IS GREAT WORK
YOU1000000102_S0000180	AND THE ONLY WAY TO DO GREAT WORK IS TO LOVE WAT YOU DO IF YOU HAVEN'T FOUND IT YET KEEP LOOKING
YOU1000000102_S0000182	AND DON'T SETTLE AS WITH ALL MATTERS OF THE HEART YOU'LL KNOW WHEN YOU FIND IT AND LIKE ANY GREAT RELATIONSHIP IT JUST GETS BETTER AND BETTER
YOU1000000102_S0000183	AS THE YEARS ROLL ON SO KEEP LOOKING DON'T SETTLE
YOU1000000102_S0000185	MY THIRD STORY IS ABOUT DEATH
YOU1000000102_S0000187	WHEN I WAS SEVENTEEN I READ A QUOTE THAT WENT SOMETHING LIKE IF YOU LIVE EACH DAY AS IF IT WAS YOUR LAST SOMEDAY YOU'LL MOST CERTAINLY BE RIGHT
YOU1000000102_S0000189	IT MADE AN IMPRESSION ON ME AND SINCE THEN FOR THE PAST THIRTY THREE YEARS I'VE LOOKED IN THE MIRROR EVERY MORNING AND ASKED MYSELF
YOU1000000102_S0000190	IF TODAY WERE THE LAST DAY OF MY LIFE WHAT I WANT TO DO WHAT I AM ABOUT TO DO TODAY AND WHENEVER THE ANSWER HAS BEEN NO FOR TOO MANY DAYS IN A ROW
YOU1000000102_S0000191	I KNOW I NEED TO CHANGE SOMETHING
YOU1000000102_S0000193	REMEMBERING THAT I'LL BE DEAD SOON IS THE MOST IMPORTANT TOOL I'VE EVER ENCOUNTERED TO HELP ME MAKE THE BIG CHOICES IN LIFE BECAUSE ALMOST EVERYTHING
YOU1000000102_S0000194	ALL EXTERNAL EXPECTATIONS ALL PRIDE ALL FEAR OF EMBARRASSMENT OR FAILURE THESE THINGS JUST FALL AWAY IN THE FACE OF DEATH LEAVING ONLY WHAT IS TRULY IMPORTANT
YOU1000000102_S0000195	REMEMBERING THAT YOU ARE GOING TO DIE IS THE BEST WAY I KNOW TO AVOID THE TRAP OF THINKING YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO LOSE YOU ARE ALREADY NAKED
YOU1000000102_S0000196	THERE IS NO REASON NOT TO FOLLOW YOUR HEART
YOU1000000102_S0000198	ABOUT A YEAR AGO I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER
YOU1000000102_S0000200	I HAD A SCAN AT SEVEN THIRTY IN THE MORNING AND IT CLEARLY SHOWED A TUMOUR ON MY PANCREAS I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT A PANCREAS WAS
YOU1000000102_S0000201	THE DOCTORS TOLD ME THIS WAS ALMOST CERTAINLY A TYPE OF CANCER THAT IS INCURABLE AND THAT I SHOULD EXPECT TO LIVE NO LONGER THAN THREE TO SIX MONTHS
YOU1000000102_S0000203	MY DOCTOR ADVISED ME TO GO HOME AND GET MY AFFAIRS IN ORDER WHICH IS DOCTORS CODE FOR PREPARE TO DIE
YOU1000000102_S0000204	IT MEANS TO TRY AND TELL YOUR KIDS EVERYTHING
YOU1000000102_S0000206	YOU THOUGHTYOU'D HAVE THE NEXT TEN YEARS TO TELL THEM IN JUST A FEW MONTHS IT MEANS TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS BUTTONED UP SO THAT WILL BE AS EASY AS POSSIBLE FOR YOUR FAMILY
YOU1000000102_S0000207	IT MEANS TO SAY YOUR GOODBYES
YOU1000000102_S0000209	I LIVE WITH THAT DIAGNOSIS ALL DAY LATER THAT EVENING I HAD A BIOPSY WHERE THEY STUCK AN ENDOSCOPE DOWN MY THROAT THROUWGH MY STOMACH AND INTO MY INTESTINES
YOU1000000102_S0000210	PUT A NEEDLE INTO MY PANCREAS AND GOT A FEW CELLS FROM THE TUMOR I WAS SEDATED BUT MY WIFE WHO WAS THERE TOLD ME THAT WHEN THEY VIEWED THE CELLS UNDER A MICROSCOPE
YOU1000000102_S0000211	THE DOCTOR STARTED CRYING BECAUSE IT TURNED OUT TO BE A VERY RARE FORM OF PANCREATIC CANCER THAT IS CURABLE WITH SURGERY
YOU1000000102_S0000212	I HAD THE SURGERY AND THANKFULLY I'M FINE NOW
YOU1000000102_S0000214	THIS WAS THE CLOSEST I'VE BEEN TO FACING DEATH AND I HOPE IT'S THE CLOSEST I GET FOR A FEW MORE DECADES HAVING LIVED THROUGH IT
YOU1000000102_S0000215	I CAN NOW SAY THIS TO YOU WITH A BIT MORE CERTAINTY THAN WHEN DEATH WAS A USEFUL BUT PURELY INTELLECTUAL CONCEPT
YOU1000000102_S0000217	NO ONE WANTS TO DIE EVEN PEOPLE WHO WANT TO GO TO HEAVEN DON'T WANT TO DIE TO GET THERE
YOU1000000102_S0000219	AND YET DEATH IS THE DESTINATION WE ALL SHARE NO ONE HAS EVER ESCAPED IT AND THAT IS AS IT SHOULD BE
YOU1000000102_S0000220	BECAUSE DEATH IS VERY LIKELY THE SINGLE BEST INVENTION OF LIFE IT'S LIFE'S CHANGE AGENT IT CLEARS OUT THE OLD TO MAKE WAY FOR THE NEW
YOU1000000102_S0000222	RIGHT NOW THE NEW IS YOU
YOU1000000102_S0000224	BUT SOMEDAY NOT TOO LONG FROM NOW YOU WILL GRADUALLY BECOME THE OLD AND BE CLEARED AWAY
YOU1000000102_S0000226	SORRY TO BE SO DRAMATIC BUT IT'S QUITE TRUE
YOU1000000102_S0000228	YOUR TIME IS LIMITED SO DON'T WASTE IT LIVING SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE DON'T BE TRAPPED BY DOGMA WHICH IS LIVING WITH THE RESULTS OF OTHER PEOPLE'S THINKING
YOU1000000102_S0000229	DON'T LET THE NOISE OF OTHERS OPINIONS DROWND OUT YOUR OWN INNER VOICE AND MOST IMPORTANT HAVE THE COURAGE TO FOLLOW YOUR HEART AND INTUITION
YOU1000000102_S0000230	THEY SOMEHOW ALREADY KNOW WHAT YOU TRULY WANT TO BECOME EVERYTHING ELSE IS SECONDARY
YOU1000000102_S0000232	WHEN I WAS YOUNG THERE WAS AN AMAZING PUBLICATION CALLED THE WHOLE EARTH CATALOG WHICH WAS ONE OF THE BIBLES OF MY GENERATION
YOU1000000102_S0000233	IT WAS CREATED BY A FELLOW NAMED STUART BRAND NOT FAR FROM HERE IN MENLOW PARK AND HE BROUGHT IT TO LIFE WITH HIS POETIC TOUCH
YOU1000000102_S0000234	THIS WAS IN THE LATE SIXTY S BEFORE PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND DESKTOP PUBLISHING SO IT WAS ALL MADE WITH TYPEWRITERS SISSORS AND POLAROID CAMERAS
YOU1000000102_S0000235	IT WAS SORT OF LIKE GOOGLE IN PAPERBACK FORM THIRTY FIVE YEARS BEFORE GOOGLE CAME ALONG IT WAS IDEALISTIC OVERFLOWING WITH NEAT TOOLS AND GREAT NOTIONS
YOU1000000102_S0000237	STUART AND HIS TEAM PUT OUT SEVERAL ISSUES OF THE WHOLE EARTH CATALOG AND THEN WHEN IT HAD RUN ITS COURSE THEY PUT OUT A FINAL ISSUE
YOU1000000102_S0000238	IT WAS THE MID NINETEEN SEVENTY S AND I WAS YOUR AGE

YOU1000000115_S0000000	HOW THE ECONOMIC MACHINE WORKS IN THIRTY MINUTES
YOU1000000115_S0000002	THE ECONOMY WORKS LIKE A SIMPLE MACHINE BUT MANY PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND IT OR THEY DON'T AGREE ON HOW IT WORKS
YOU1000000115_S0000003	AND THIS HAS LED TO A LOT OF NEEDLESS ECONOMIC SUFFERING
YOU1000000115_S0000005	I FEEL A DEEP SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY TO SHARE MY SIMPLE BUT PRACTICAL ECONOMIC TEMPLATE
YOU1000000115_S0000007	THOUGH IT'S UNCONVENTIONAL
YOU1000000115_S0000009	THAS HELPED ME TO ANTICIPATE AND TO SIDESTEP THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS AND IT HAS WORKED WELL FOR ME FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS
YOU1000000115_S0000010	LET'S BEGIN THOUGH THE ECONOMY MIGHT SEEM COMPLEX IT WORKS IN A SIMPLE MECHANICAL WAY
YOU1000000115_S0000011	IT'S MADE UP OF A FEW SIMPLE PARTS AND A LOT OF SIMPLE TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE REPEATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN A MILLION TIMES
YOU1000000115_S0000012	THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE ABOVE ALL ELSE DRIVEN BY HUMAN NATURE AND THEY CREATE THREE MAIN FORCES THAT DRIVE THE ECONOMY
YOU1000000115_S0000013	NUMBER ONE PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH NUMBER TWO THE SHORT TERM DEBT CYCLE AND NUMBER THREE THE LONG TERM DEBT CYCLE
YOU1000000115_S0000014	WE'LL LOOK AT THESE THREE FORCES AND HOW LAYING THEM ON TOP OF EACH OTHER CREATES A GOOD TEMPLATE FOR TRACKING ECONOMIC MOVEMENTS AND FIGURING OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW
YOU1000000115_S0000015	LET'S START WITH THE SIMPLEST PART OF THE ECONOMY TRANSACTIONS
YOU1000000115_S0000017	AN ECONOMY IS SIMPLY THE SUM OF THE TRANSACTIONS THAT MAKE IT UP AND A TRANSACTION IS A VERY SIMPLE THING
YOU1000000115_S0000018	YOU MAKE TRANSACTIONS ALL THE TIME EVERY TIME YOU BUY SOMETHING YOU CREATE A TRANSACTION
YOU1000000115_S0000019	EACH TRANSACTION CONSISTS OF A BUYER EXCHANGING MONEY OR CREDIT WITH A SELLER FOR GOODS SERVICES OR FINANCIAL ASSETS
YOU1000000115_S0000020	CREDIT SPENDS JUST LIKE MONEY SO ADDING TOGETHER THE MONEY SPENT AND THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT SPENT YOU COULD KNOW THE TOTAL SPENDING
YOU1000000115_S0000021	THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF SPENDING DRIVES THE ECONOMY
YOU1000000115_S0000022	IF YOU DIVIDE THE AMOUNT SPENT BY THE QUANTITY SOLD YOU GET THE PRICE AND THAT'S IT THAT'S A TRANSACTION
YOU1000000115_S0000023	IT'S THE BUILDING BLOCK OF THE ECONOMIC MACHINE
YOU1000000115_S0000024	ALL CYCLES AND ALL FORCES IN AN ECONOMY ARE DRIVEN BY TRANSACTIONS SO IF WE CAN UNDERSTAND TRANSACTIONS WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE ECONOMY
YOU1000000115_S0000025	A MARKET CONSISTS OF ALL THE BUYERS AND ALL THE SELLERS MAKING TRANSACTIONS FOR THE SAME THING
YOU1000000115_S0000026	FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS A WHEAT MARKET A CAR MARKET A STOCK MARKET AND MARKETS FOR MILLIONS OF THINGS
YOU1000000115_S0000027	AN ECONOMY CONSISTS OF ALL OF THE TRANSACTIONS IN ALL OF ITS MARKETS
YOU1000000115_S0000028	IF YOU ADD UP THE TOTAL SPENDING AND THE TOTAL QUANTITY SOLD IN ALL OF THE MARKETS YOU HAVE EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW TO UNDERSTAND THE ECONOMY
YOU1000000115_S0000029	IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE
YOU1000000115_S0000030	PEOPLE BUSINESSES BANKS AND GOVERNMENTS ALL ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS THE WAY I JUST DESCRIBED
YOU1000000115_S0000031	EXCHANGING MONEY AND CREDIT FOR GOODS SERVICES AND FINANCIAL ASSETS
YOU1000000115_S0000032	THE BIGGEST BUYER AND SELLER IS THE GOVERNMENT WHICH CONSISTS OF TWO IMPORTANT PARTS
YOU1000000115_S0000033	A CENTRAL GOVERNMENT THAT COLLECTS TAXES AND SPENDS MONEY AND A CENTRAL BANK WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER BUYERS AND SELLERS
YOU1000000115_S0000034	BECAUSE IT CONTROLS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY AND CREDIT IN THE ECONOMY
YOU1000000115_S0000035	IT DOES THIS BY INFLUENCING INTEREST RATES AND PRINTING NEW MONEY
YOU1000000115_S0000037	FOR THESE REASONS AS WE'LL SEE THE CENTRAL BANK IS AN IMPORTANT PLAYER IN THE FLOW OF CREDIT
YOU1000000115_S0000038	I WANT YOU TO PAY ATTENTION TO CREDIT
YOU1000000115_S0000039	CREDIT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE ECONOMY AND PROBABLY THE LEAST UNDERSTOOD
YOU1000000115_S0000040	IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT PART BECAUSE IT'S THE BIGGEST AND MOST VOLATILE PAT
YOU1000000115_S0000042	JUST LIKE BUYERS AND SELLERS GO TO THE MARKET TO MAKE TRANSACTIONS SO DO LENDERS AND BORROWERS
YOU1000000115_S0000043	LENDERS USUALLY WANT TO MAKE THEIR MONEY INTO MORE MONEY AND BORROWERS USUALLY WANT TO BUY SOMETHING THEY CAN'T AFFORD
YOU1000000115_S0000044	LIKE A HOUSE OR A CAR OR THEY WANT TO INVEST IN SOMETHING LIKE STARTING A BUSINESS
YOU1000000115_S0000045	CREDIT CAN HELP BOTH LENDERS AND BORROWERS GET WHAT THEY WANT
YOU1000000115_S0000046	BORROWERS PROMISE TO REPAY THE AMOUNT THEY BORROW CALLED PRINCIPAL PLUS AN ADDITIONAL AMOUNT CALLED INTEREST
YOU1000000115_S0000047	WHEN INTEREST RATES ARE HIGH THERE IS LESS BORROWING BECAUSE IT'S EXPENSIVE
YOU1000000115_S0000048	WHEN INTEREST RATES ARE LOW BORROWING INCREASES BECAUSE IT'S CHEAPER
YOU1000000115_S0000050	WHEN BORROWERS PROMISE TO REPAY AND LENDERS BELIEVE THEM CREDIT IS CREATED
YOU1000000115_S0000052	ANY TWO PEOPLE CAN AGREE TO CREATE CREDIT OUT OF THIN AIR
YOU1000000115_S0000053	THAT SEEMS SIMPLE ENOUGH BUT CREDIT IS TRICKY BECAUSE IT HAS DIFFERENT NAMES
YOU1000000115_S0000054	AS SOON AS CREDIT IS CREATED IT IMMEDIATELY TURNS INTO DEBT
YOU1000000115_S0000055	DEBT IS BOTH AN ASSET TO THE LENDER AND A LIABILITY TO THE BORROWER
YOU1000000115_S0000057	IN THE FUTURE WHEN THE BORROWER REPAYS THE LOAN PLUS INTEREST THE ASSET AND THE LIABILITY DISAPPEAR AND THE TRANSACTION IS SETTLED
YOU1000000115_S0000058	SO WHY IS CREDIT SO IMPORTANT
YOU1000000115_S0000060	BECAUSE WHEN A BORROWER RECEIVES CREDIT HE IS ABLE TO INCREASE HIS SPENDING AND REMEMBER SPENDING DRIVES THE ECONOMY
YOU1000000115_S0000061	THIS IS BECAUSE ONE PERSON'S SPENDING IS ANOTHER PERSON'S INCOME
YOU1000000115_S0000062	THINK ABOUT IT
YOU1000000115_S0000064	EVERY DOLLAR YOU SPEND SOMEONE ELSE EARNS AND EVERY DOLLAR YOU EARN SOMEONE ELSE HAS SPENT
YOU1000000115_S0000065	SO WHEN YOU SPEND MORE SOMEONE ELSE EARNS MORE
YOU1000000115_S0000066	WHEN SOMEONE'S INCOME RISES IT MAKES LENDERS MORE WILLING TO LEND HIM MONEY BECAUSE NOW HE'S MORE WORTHY OF CREDIT
YOU1000000115_S0000067	A CREDIT WORTHY BORROWER HAS TWO THINGS THE ABILITY TO REPAY AND COLLATERAL
YOU1000000115_S0000068	HAVING A LOT OF INCOME IN RELATION TO HIS DEBT GIVES HIM THE ABILITY TO REPAY
YOU1000000115_S0000070	IN THE EVENT THAT HE CAN'T REPAY HE HAS VALUABLE ASSETS TO USE AS COLLATERAL THAT CAN BE SOLD THIS MAKES LENDERS FEEL COMFORTABLE LENDING HIM MONEY
YOU1000000115_S0000071	SO INCREASED INCOME ALLOWS INCREASED BORROWING WHICH ALLOWS INCREASED SPENDING
YOU1000000115_S0000072	AND SINCE ONE PERSON'S SPENDING IS ANOTHER PERSON'S INCOME THIS LEADS TO MORE INCREASED BORROWING AND SO ON
YOU1000000115_S0000073	THIS SELF REINFORCING PATTERN LEADS TO ECONOMIC GROWTH AND IS WHY WE HAVE CYCLES
YOU1000000115_S0000075	IN A TRANSACTION YOU HAVE TO GIVE SOMETHING IN ORDER TO GET SOMETHING AND HOW MUCH YOU GET DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH YOU PRODUCE
YOU1000000115_S0000077	OVER TIME WE LEARN AND THAT ACCUMULATED KNOWLEDGE RAISES OUR LIVING STANDARDS WE CALL THIS PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH
YOU1000000115_S0000078	THOSE WHO ARE INVENTIVE AND HARD WORKING RAISE THEIR PRODUCTIVITY AND THEIR LIVING STANDARDS FASTER THAN THOSE WHO ARE COMPLACENT AND LAZY
YOU1000000115_S0000079	BUT THAT ISN'T NECESSARILY TRUE OVER THE SHORT RUN
YOU1000000115_S0000080	PRODUCTIVITY MATTERS MOST IN THE LONG RUN BUT CREDIT MATTERS MOST IN THE SHORT RUN
YOU1000000115_S0000081	THIS IS BECAUSE PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH DOESN'T FLUCTUATE MUCH SO IT'S NOT A BIG DRIVER OF ECONOMIC SWINGS
YOU1000000115_S0000082	DEBT IS BECAUSE IT ALLOWS US TO CONSUME MORE THAN WE PRODUCE WHEN WE ACQUIRE IT AND IT FORCES US TO CONSUME LESS THAN WE PRODUCE WHEN WE HAVE TO PAY IT BACK
YOU1000000115_S0000083	DEBT SWINGS OCCUR IN TWO BIG CYCLES ONE TAKES ABOUT FIVE TO EIGHT YEARS AND THE OTHER TAKES ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE TO A HUNDRED YEARS
YOU1000000115_S0000084	WHILE MOST PEOPLE FEEL THE SWINGS THEY TYPICALLY DON'T SEE THEM AS CYCLES BECAUSE THEY SEE THEM TOO UP CLOSE DAY BY DAY WEEK BY WEEK
YOU1000000115_S0000085	IN THIS CHAPTER WE'RE GOING TO STEP BACK AND LOOK AT THESE THREE BIG FORCES AND HOW THEY INTERACT TO MAKE UP OUR EXPERIENCES
YOU1000000115_S0000086	AS MENTIONED SWINGS AROUND THE LINE ARE NOT DUE TO HOW MUCH INNOVATION OR HARD WORK THERE IS THEY'RE PRIMARILY DUE TO HOW MUCH CREDIT THERE IS
YOU1000000115_S0000087	LET'S FOR A SECOND IMAGINE AN ECONOMY WITHOUT CREDIT IN THIS ECONOMY THE ONLY WAY I CAN INCREASE MY SPENDING IS TO INCREASE MY INCOME
YOU1000000115_S0000088	WHICH REQUIRES ME TO BE MORE PRODUCTIVE AND DO MORE WORK INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY IS THE ONLY WAY FOR GROWTH
YOU1000000115_S0000089	SINCE MY SPENDING IS ANOTHER PERSON'S INCOME THE ECONOMY GROWS EVERYTIME I OR ANYONE ELSE IS MORE PRODUCTIVE
YOU1000000115_S0000090	IF WE FOLLOW THE TRANSACTIONS AND PLAY THIS OUT WE SEE A PROGRESSION LIKE THE PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH LINE BUT BECAUSE WE BORROW WE HAVE CYCLES
YOU1000000115_S0000091	THIS ISN'T DUE TO ANY LAWS OR REGULATIONS IT'S DUE TO HUMAN NATURE AND THE WAY THE CREDIT WORKS
YOU1000000115_S0000092	THINK OF BORROWING AS SIMPLY A WAY OF PULLING SPENDING FORWARD IN ORDER TO BUY SOMETHING YOU CAN'T AFFORD YOU NEED TO SPEND MORE THAN YOU MAKE
YOU1000000115_S0000093	TO DO THIS YOU ESSENTIALLY NEED TO BORROW FROM YOUR FUTURE SELF IN DOING SO YOU CREATE A TIME IN THE FUTURE THAT YOU NEED TO SPEND LESS THAN YOU MAKE
YOU1000000115_S0000094	IN ORDER TO PAY IT BACK IT VERY QUICKLY RESEMBLES A CYCLE BASICALLY ANY TIME YOU BORROW YOU CREATE A CYCLE
YOU1000000115_S0000095	THIS IS AS TRUE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL AS IT IS FOR THE ECONOMY
YOU1000000115_S0000096	THIS IS WHY UNDERSTANDING CREDIT IS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT SETS INTO MOTION A MECHANICAL PREDICTABLE SERIES OF EVENTS THAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE
YOU1000000115_S0000097	THIS MAKES CREDIT DIFFERENT FOR MONEY MONEY IS WHAT YOU SETTLE TRANSACTIONS WITH
YOU1000000115_S0000098	WHEN YOU BUY A BEER FROM A BARTENDER WITH CASH THE TRANSACTION IS SETTLED IMMEDIATELY
YOU1000000115_S0000099	BUT WHEN YOU BUY A BEER WITH CREDIT IT'S LIKE STARTING A BAR TAB YOU'RE SAYING YOU PROMISE TO PAY IN THE FUTURE
YOU1000000115_S0000100	TOGETHER YOU AND THE BARTENDER CREATE AN ASSET AND A LIABILITY YOU JUST CREATED CREDIT OUT OF THIN AIR
YOU1000000115_S0000101	IT'S NOT UNTIL YOU PAY THE BAR TAB LATER THAT THE ASSET AND THE LIABILITY DISAPPEAR THE DEBT GOES AWAY AND THE TRANSACTION IS SETTLED
YOU1000000115_S0000103	THE REALITY IS THAT MOST OF WHAT PEOPLE CALL MONEY IS ACTUALLY CREDIT
YOU1000000115_S0000104	THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF CREDIT IN THE UNITED STATES IS ABOUT FIFTY TRILLION DOLLARS AND THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF MONEY IS ONLY ABOUT THREE TRILLION DOLLARS
YOU1000000115_S0000105	REMEMBER IN AN ECONOMY WITHOUT CREDIT THE ONLY WAY TO INCREASE YOUR SPENDING IS TO PRODUCE MORE
YOU1000000115_S0000106	BUT IN AN ECONOMY WITH CREDIT YOU CAN ALSO INCREASE YOUR SPENDING BY BORROWING
YOU1000000115_S0000107	AS A RESULT AN ECONOMY WITH CREDIT HAS MORE SPENDING AND ALLOWS INCOMES TO RISE FASTER THAN PRODUCTIVITY OVER THE SHORT RUN BUT NOT OVER THE LONG RUN
YOU1000000115_S0000108	NDON'T GET ME WRONG CREDIT ISN'T NECESSARILY SOMETHING BAD THAT JUST CAUSES CYCLES
YOU1000000115_S0000109	IT'S BAD WHEN IT FINANCES OVERCONSUMPTION THAT CAN'T BE PAID BACK
YOU1000000115_S0000110	HOWEVER IT'S GOOD WHEN IT EFFICIENTLY ALLOCATES RESOURCES AND PRODUCES INCOME SO YOU CAN PAY BACK THE DEBT
YOU1000000115_S0000111	FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU BORROW MONEY TO BUY A BIG TV IT DOESN'T GENERATE INCOME FOR YOU TO PAY BACK THE DEBT
YOU1000000115_S0000112	WO BUT IF YOU BORROW MONEY TO SAY BUY A TRACTOR
YOU1000000115_S0000114	AND THAT TRACTOR LETS YOU HARVEST MORE CROPS AND EARN MORE MONEY THEN YOU CAN PAY BACK YOUR DEBT AND IMPROVE YOUR LIVING STANDARD
YOU1000000115_S0000116	IN AN ECONOMY WITH CREDIT WE CAN FOLLOW THE TRANSACTIONS AND SEE HOW CREDIT CREATES GROWTH
YOU1000000115_S0000118	LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE SUPPOSE YOU EARN A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND HAVE NO DEBT YOU ARE CREDITWORTHY ENOUGH TO BORROW TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS
YOU1000000115_S0000119	SAY ON A CREDIT CARD SO YOU CAN SPEND A HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS EVEN THOUGH YOU ONLY EARN A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
YOU1000000115_S0000120	SINCE YOU'RE SPENDING IS ANOTHER PERSON'S INCOME SOMEONE IS EARNING A HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS
YOU1000000115_S0000121	THE PERSON EARNING A HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WITH NO DEBT CAN BORROW ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS SO HE CAN SPEND A HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS
YOU1000000115_S0000122	EVEN THOUGH HE HAS ONLY EARNED A HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS
YOU1000000115_S0000123	HIS SPENDING IS ANOTHER PERSON'S INCOME AND BY FOLLOWING THE TRANSACTIONS WE CAN BEGIN TO SEE HOW THIS PROCESS WORKS IN A SELF REINFORCING PATTERN
YOU1000000115_S0000124	BUT REMEMBER BORROWING CREATES CYCLES AND IF THE CYCLE GOES UP IT EVENTUALLY NEEDS TO COME DOWN
YOU1000000115_S0000125	THIS LEADS US INTO THE SHORT TERM DEBT CYCLE
YOU1000000115_S0000127	AS ECONOMIC ACTIVITY INCREASEES WE SEE AN EXPANSION THE FIRST PHASE OF THE SHORT TERM DEBT CYCLE
YOU1000000115_S0000128	SPENDING CONTINUES TO INCREASE AND PRICES START TO RISE
YOU1000000115_S0000129	THIS HAPPENS BECAUSE THE INCREASE IN SPENDING IS FUELED BY CREDIT WHICH CAN BE CREATED INSTANTLY OUT OF THIN AIR
YOU1000000115_S0000130	WHEN THE AMOUNT OF SPENDING AND INCOMES GROW FASTER THAN THE PRODUCTION OF GOODS PRICES RISE
YOU1000000115_S0000131	WHEN PRICES RISE WE CALL THIS INFLATION THE CENTRAL BANK DOESN'T WANT TOO MUCH INFLATION BECAUSE IT CAUSES PROBLEMS
YOU1000000115_S0000132	SEEING PRICES RISE IT RAISES INTEREST RATES WITH HIGHER INTEREST RATES FEWER PEOPLE CAN AFFORD TO BORROW MONEY
YOU1000000115_S0000133	AND THE COST OF EXISTING DEBTS RISES THINK ABOUT THIS AS THE MONTHLY PAYMENTS ON YOUR CREDIT CARD GOING UP
YOU1000000115_S0000135	BECAUSE PEOPLE BORROW LESS AND HAVE HIGHER DEBT REPAYMENTS THEY HAVE LESS MONEY LEFT OVER TO SPEND SO SPENDING SLOWS
YOU1000000115_S0000136	AND SINCE ONE PERSON'S SPENDING IS ANOTHER PERSON'S INCOME INCOMES DROP AND SO ON AND SO FORTH
YOU1000000115_S0000137	WHEN PEOPLE SPEND LESS PRICES GO DOWN WE CALL THIS DEFLATION ECONOMIC ACTIVITY DECREASES
YOU1000000115_S0000138	AND WE HAVE A RECESSION IF THE RECESSION BECOMES TOO SEVERE AND INFLATION IS NO LONGER A PROBLEM
YOU1000000115_S0000139	THE CENTRAL BANK WILL LOWER INTEREST RATES TO CAUSE EVERYTHING TO PICK UP AGAIN
YOU1000000115_S0000140	WITH LOW INTEREST RATES DEBT REPAYMENTS ARE REDUCED AND BORROWING AND SPENDING PICK UP AND WE SEE ANOTHER EXPANSION
YOU1000000115_S0000141	AS YOU CAN SEE THE ECONOMY WORKS LIKE A MACHINE
YOU1000000115_S0000142	IN THE SHORT TERM DEBT CYCLE SPENDING IS CONSTRAINED ONLY BY THE WILLINGNESS OF LENDERS AND BORROWERS TO PROVIDE AND RECEIVE CREDIT
YOU1000000115_S0000143	WHEN CREDIT IS EASILY AVAILABLE THERE'S AN ECONOMIC EXPANSION WHEN CREDIT ISN'T EASILY AVAILABLE THERE'S A RECESSION
YOU1000000115_S0000144	AND NOTE THAT THIS CYCLE IS CONTROLLED PRIMARILY BY THE CENTRAL BANK
YOU1000000115_S0000145	THE SHORT TERM DEBT CYCLE TYPICALLY LASTS FIVE TO EIGHT YEARS AND HAPPENS OVER AND OVER AGAIN FOR DECADES
YOU1000000115_S0000146	BUT NOTICE THAT THE BOTTOM AND TOP OF EACH CYCLE FINISH WITH MORE GROWTH THAN THE PREVIOUS CYCLE AND WITH MORE DEBT
YOU1000000115_S0000147	WHY BECAUSE PEOPLE PUSH IT
YOU1000000115_S0000148	THEY HAVE AN INCLINATION TO BORROW AND SPEND MORE INSTEAD OF PAYING BACK DEBT IT'S HUMAN NATURE
YOU1000000115_S0000149	BECAUSE OF THIS OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME DEBTS RISE FASTER THAN INCOMES CREATING THE LONG TERM DEBT CYCLE
YOU1000000115_S0000151	DESPITE PEOPLE BECOMING MORE INDEBTED LENDERS EVEN MORE FREELY EXTEND CREDIT
YOU1000000115_S0000153	WHY
YOU1000000115_S0000155	BECAUSE EVERYONE THINKS THINGS ARE GOING GREAT PEOPLE ARE JUST FOCUSED ON WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING LATELY AND WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING LATELY
YOU1000000115_S0000157	INCOMES HAVE BEEN RISING ASSET VALUES ARE GOING UP THE STOCK MARKET ROARS IT'S A BOOM
YOU1000000115_S0000158	IT PAYS TO BUY GOODS SERVICES AND FINANCIAL ASSETS WITH BORROWED MONEY WHEN PEOPLE DO A LOT OF THAT WE CALL IT A BUBBLE
YOU1000000115_S0000159	SO EVEN THOUGH DEBTS HAVE BEEN GROWING INCOMES HAVE BEEN GROWING NEARLY AS FAST TO OFFSET THEM LET'S CALL THE RATIO OF DEBT TO INCOME THE DEBT BURDEN
YOU1000000115_S0000160	SO LONG AS INCOMES CONTINUE TO RISE THE DEBT BURDEN STAYS MANAGEABLE AT THE SAME TIME ASSET VALUES SORE
YOU1000000115_S0000161	PEOPLE BORROW HUGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY TO BUY ASSETS AS INVESTMENTS CAUSING THEIR PRICES TO RISE EVEN HIGHER
YOU1000000115_S0000162	PEOPLE FEEL WEL
YOU1000000115_S0000164	EVEN WITH THE ACCUMULATION OF LOTS OF DEBT RISING INCOMES AND ASSET VALUES HELP BORROWERS REMAIN CREDIT WORTHY FOR A LONG TIME
YOU1000000115_S0000165	BUT THIS OBVIOUSLY CANNOT CONTINUE FOREVER AND IT DOESN'T
YOU1000000115_S0000166	OVER DECADES DEBT BURDENS SLOWLY INCREASED CREATING LARGER AND LARGER DEBT REPAYMENTS
YOU1000000115_S0000167	AT SOME POINT DEBT REPAYMENTS START GROWING FASTER THAN INCOMES FORCING PEOPLE TO CUT BACK ON THEIR SPENDING
YOU1000000115_S0000168	AND SINCE ONE PERSON'S SPENDING IS ANOTHER PERSON'S INCOME INCOMES BEGIN TO GO DOWN WHICH MAKES PEOPLE LESS CREDITWORTHY
YOU1000000115_S0000170	CAUSING BORROWING TO GO DOWN DEBT REPAYMENTS CONTINUE TO RISE WHICH MAKES SPENDING DROP EVEN FURTHER
YOU1000000115_S0000171	AND THE CYCLE REVERSES ITSELF
YOU1000000115_S0000173	THIS IS THE LONG TERM DEBT PEAK DEBT BURDENS HAVE SIMPLY BECOME TOO BIG
YOU1000000115_S0000175	R THE UNITED STATES EUROPE AND MUCH OF THE REST OF THE WORLD THIS HAPPENED IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT
YOU1000000115_S0000176	IT HAPPENED FOR THE SAME REASON IT HAPPENED IN JAPAN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE AND IN THE UNITED STATES BACK IN NINETEEN TWENTY NINE
YOU1000000115_S0000177	NOW THE ECONOMY BEGINS DELEVERAGING
YOU1000000115_S0000179	INADELEVERAGING PEOPLE CUT SPENDING INCOMES FALL CREDIT DISAPPEARS ASSET PRICES DROP
YOU1000000115_S0000180	BANKS GET SQUEEZED THE STOCK MARKET CRASHES SOCIAL TENSIONS RISE AND THE WHOLE THING STARTS TO FEED ON ITSELF THE OTHER WAY
YOU1000000115_S0000182	AS INCOMES FALL AND DEBT REPAYMENTS RISE BORROWERS GET SQUEEZED NO LONGER CREDIT WORTHY
YOU1000000115_S0000183	CREDIT DRIES UP AND BORROWERS CAN NO LONGER BORROW ENOUGH MONEY TO MAKE THEIR DEBT REPAYMENTS
YOU1000000115_S0000184	SCRAMBLING TO FILL THIS HOLE BORROWERS ARE FORCED TO SELL ASSETS THE RUSH TO SELL ASSETS FLOODS THE MARKET AT THE SAME TIME AS SPENDING FALLS
YOU1000000115_S0000185	THIS IS WHEN THE STOCK MARKET COLLAPSES THE REAL ESTATE MARKET TANKS AND BANKS GET INTO TROUBLE
YOU1000000115_S0000186	AS ASSET PRICES DROP THE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL BORROWERS CAN PUT UP DROPS THIS MAKES BORROWERS EVEN LESS CREDITWORTHY
YOU1000000115_S0000187	PEOPLE FEEL POOR CREDIT RAPIDLY DISAPPEARS
YOU1000000115_S0000188	LESS SPENDING LESS INCOME LESS WEALTH LESS CREDIT LESS BORROWING AND SO ON IT'S A VICIOUS CYCLE
YOU1000000115_S0000189	THIS APPEARS SIMILAR TO A RECESSION BUT THE DIFFERENCE HERE IS THAT INTEREST RATES CAN'T BE LOWERED TO SAVE THE DAY
YOU1000000115_S0000190	IN A RECESSION LOWERING INTEREST RATES WORKS TO STIMULATE BORROWING
YOU1000000115_S0000191	HOWEVER IN ADELEVERAGING LOWERING INTEREST RATES DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE INTEREST RATES ARE ALREADY LOW AND SOON HIT ZERO PERCENT SO THE STIMULATION ENDS
YOU1000000115_S0000193	INTEREST RATES IN THE UNITED STATES HIT ZERO PERCENT DURING THE DLEVERAGING OF THE NINETEEN THIRTY S AND AGAIN IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT
YOU1000000115_S0000194	THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A RECESSION AND A DELEVERAGING
YOU1000000115_S0000195	IS THAT IN DELEVERAGING BORROWERS DEBT BURDENS HAVE SIMPLY GOTTEN TOO BIG AND CAN'T BE RELIEVED BY LOWERING INTEREST RATES
YOU1000000115_S0000196	LENDERS REALIZE THAT DEBTS HAVE BECOME TOO LARGE TO EVER BE FULLY PAID BACK
YOU1000000115_S0000197	BORROWERS HAVE LOST THEIR ABILITY TO REPAY AND THEIR COLLATERAL HAS LOST VALUE
YOU1000000115_S0000198	THEY FEEL CRIPPLED BY THE DEBT THEY DON'T EVEN WANT MORE LENDERS STOP LENDING BORROWERS STOP BORROWING
YOU1000000115_S0000199	THINK OF THE ECONOMY AS BEING NOT CREDITWORTHY JUST LIKE AN INDIVIDUAL SO WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT IT DELEVERAGING
YOU1000000115_S0000200	THE PROBLEM IS DEBT BURDENS ARE TOO HIGH AND THEY MUST COME DOWN
YOU1000000115_S0000201	THERE ARE FOUR WAYS THIS CAN HAPPEN ONE PEOPLE BUSINESSES AND GOVERNMENTS CUT THEIR SPENDING
YOU1000000115_S0000202	TWO DEBTS ARE REDUCED THROUGH DEFAULTS AND RESTRUCTURINGS THREE WEALTH IS REDISTRIBUTED FROM THE HAVES TO THE HAVE NOTS
YOU1000000115_S0000203	AND FINALLY FOUR THE CENTRAL BANK PRINTS NEW MONEY THESE FOUR WAYS HAVE HAPPENED IN EVERY DELEVERAGING IN MODERN HISTORY
YOU1000000115_S0000205	USUALLY SPENDING IS CUT FIRST AS WE JUST SAW PEOPLE BUSINESSES AND EVEN GOVERNMENTS TIGHTEN THEIR BELTS AND CUT THEIR SPENDING SO THAT THEY CAN PAY DOWN THEIR DEBT
YOU1000000115_S0000206	THIS IS OFTEN REFERRED TO AS AUSTERITY WHEN BORROWERS STOP TAKING ON NEW DEBTS AND START PAYING DOWN OLD DEBTS
YOU1000000115_S0000207	YOU MIGHT EXPECT THE DEBT BURDEN TO DECREASE BUT THE OPPOSITE HAPPENS BECAUSE SPENDING IS CUT
YOU1000000115_S0000208	AND ONE MAN'S SPENDING IS ANOTHER MAN'S INCOME IT CAUSES INCOMES TO FALL
YOU1000000115_S0000209	THEY FALL FASTER THAN DEBTS ARE REPAID AND THE DEBT BURDEN ACTUALLY GETS WORSE AS WE'VE SEEN THIS CUT IN SPENDING IS DEFLATIONARY AND PAINFUL
YOU1000000115_S0000210	BUSINESSES ARE FORCED TO CUT COSTS WHICH MEANS LESS JOBS AND HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT THIS LEADS TO THE NEXT STEP DEBTS MUST BE REDUCED
YOU1000000115_S0000211	MANY BORROWERS FIND THEMSELVES UNABLE TO REPAY THEIR LOANS AND A BORROWER'S DEBTS ARE A LENDER'S ASSETS
YOU1000000115_S0000212	WHEN A BORROWER DOESN'T REPAY THE BANK PEOPLE GET NERVOUS THAT THE BANK WON'T BE ABLE TO REPAY THEM SO THEY RUSH TO WITHDRAW THEIR MONEY FROM THE BANK
YOU1000000115_S0000213	BANKS GET SQUEEZED AND PEOPLE BUSINESSES AND BANKS DEFAULT ON THEIR DEBTS
YOU1000000115_S0000214	THIS SEVERE ECONOMIC CONTRACTION IS A DEPRESSION
YOU1000000115_S0000215	A BIG PART OF A DEPRESSION IS PEOPLE DISCOVERING MUCH OF WHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS THEIR WEALTH ISN'T REALLY THERE
YOU1000000115_S0000216	LET'S GO BACK TO THE BAR WHEN YOU BOUGHT A BEER AND PUT IT ON A BAR TAB YOU PROMISED TO REPAY THE BARTENDER
YOU1000000115_S0000217	YOUR PROMISE BECAME AN ASSET OF THE BARTENDER
YOU1000000115_S0000218	BUT IF YOU BREAK YOUR PROMISE IF YOU DON'T PAY HIM BACK AND ESSENTIALLY DEFAULT ON YOUR BAR TAB THEN THE ASSET HE HAS ISN'T REALLY WORTH ANYTHING
YOU1000000115_S0000219	IT HAS BASICALLY DISAPPEARED
YOU1000000115_S0000221	MANY LENDERS DON'T WANT THEIR ASSETS TO DISAPPEAR AND AGREE TO DEBT RESTRUCTURING
YOU1000000115_S0000222	DEBT RESTRUCTURING MEANS LENDERS GET PAID BACK LESS OR GET PAID BACK OVER A LONGER TIMEFRAME OR AT A LOWER INTEREST RATE THAN WAS FIRST AGREED
YOU1000000115_S0000223	SOMEHOW A CONTRACT IS BROKEN IN A WAY THAT REDUCES DEBT LENDERS WOULD RATHER HAVE A LITTLE OF SOMETHING THAN ALL OF NOTHING
YOU1000000115_S0000224	EVEN THOUGH DEBT DISAPPEARS DEBT RESTRUCTURING CAUSES INCOME AND ASSET VALUES TO DISAPPEAR FASTER SO THE DEBT BURDEN CONTINUES TO GET WORSE
YOU1000000115_S0000225	LIKE CUTTING SPENDING DEBT REDUCTION IS ALSO PAINFUL AND DEFLATIONARY
YOU1000000115_S0000227	ALL OF THIS IMPACTS THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE LOWER INCOMES AND LESS EMPLOYMENT MEANS THE GOVERNMENT COLLECTS FEWER TAXES
YOU1000000115_S0000228	AT THE SAME TIME IT NEEDS TO INCREASE ITS SPENDING BECAUSE UNEMPLOYMENT HAS RISEN
YOU1000000115_S0000229	MANY OF THE UNEMPLOYED HAVE INADEQUATE SAVINGS AND NEED FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM THE GOVERNMENT
YOU1000000115_S0000230	ADDITIONALLY GOVERNMENTS CREATE STIMULUS PLANS AND INCREASE THEIR SPENDING TO MAKE UP FOR THE DECREASE IN THE ECONOMY
YOU1000000115_S0000231	GOVERNMENT'S BUDGET DEFICITS EXPLODE IN LEVERAGING BECAUSE THEY SPEND MORE THAN THEY EARN IN TAXES
YOU1000000115_S0000232	THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING WHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT THE BUDGET DEFICIT ON THE NEWS
YOU1000000115_S0000234	TO FUND THEIR DEFICITS GOVERNMENTS NEED TO EITHER RAISE TAXES OR BORROW MONEY
YOU1000000115_S0000235	BUT WITH INCOMES FALLING AND SO MANY UNEMPLOYED WHO IS THE MONEY GOING TO COME FROM
YOU1000000115_S0000236	THE RICH SINCE GOVERNMENTS NEED MORE MONEY AND SINCE WEALTH IS HEAVILY CONCENTRATED IN THE HANDS OF A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE PEOPLE
YOU1000000115_S0000237	GOVERNMENTS NATURALLY RAISE TAXES ON THE WEALTHY WHICH FACILITATES A REDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH IN THE ECONOMY FROM THE HAVES TO THE HAVE NOTS
YOU1000000115_S0000238	THE HAV NOTS WHO ARE SUFFERING BEGIN TO RESENT THE WEALTHY HAVS
YOU1000000115_S0000239	THE WEALTHY HAVES BEING SQUEEZED BY THE WEAK ECONOMY FALLING ASSET PRICES AND HIGHER TAXES BEGIN TO RESENT THE HAVE NOTS
YOU1000000115_S0000240	IF THE DEPRESSION CONTINUES SOCIAL DISORDER CAN BREAK OUT
YOU1000000115_S0000241	NOT ONLY DO TENSIONS RISE WITHIN COUNTRIES THEY CAN RISE BETWEEN COUNTRIES ESPECIALLY DEBTOR AND CREDITOR COUNTRIES
YOU1000000115_S0000242	THIS SITUATION CAN LEAD TO POLITICAL CHANGE THAT CAN SOMETIMES BE EXTREME
YOU1000000115_S0000243	IN THE NINETEEN THIRTY S THIS LED TO HITLER COMING TO POWER WAR IN EUROPE AND DEPRESSION IN THE UNITED STATES
YOU1000000115_S0000244	PRESSURE TO DO SOMETHING TO END THE DEPRESSION INCREASES
YOU1000000115_S0000245	EMEMBER MOST OF WHAT PEOPLE THOUGHT WAS MONEY WAS ACTUALLY CREDIT SO WHEN CREDIT DISAPPEARS PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY
YOU1000000115_S0000246	PEOPLE ARE DESPERATE FOR MONEY AND YOU REMEMBER WHO CAN PRINT MONEY THE CENTRAL BANK CAN
YOU1000000115_S0000248	HAVING ALREADY LOWERED ITS INTEREST RATES TO NEARLY ZERO IT'S FORCED TO PRINT MONEY
YOU1000000115_S0000249	UNLIKE CUTTING SPENDING DEBT REDUCTION AND WEALTH REDISTRIBUTION PRINTING MONEY IS INFLATIONARY AND STIMULATIVE
YOU1000000115_S0000250	INEVITABLY THE CENTRAL BANK PRINTS NEW MONEY OUT OF THIN AIR AND USES IT TO BUY FINANCIAL ASSETS AND GOVERNMENT BONDS
YOU1000000115_S0000251	IT HAPPENED IN THE UNITED STATES DURING THE GREAT DEPRESSION
YOU1000000115_S0000252	AND AGAIN IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT WHEN THE UNITED STATES CENTRAL BANK THE FEDERAL RESERVE PRINTED OVER TWO TRILLION DOLLARS
YOU1000000115_S0000253	OTHER CENTRAL BANKS AROUND THE WORLD THAT COULD PRINTED A LOT OF MONEY TOO
YOU1000000115_S0000254	BY BUYING FINANCIAL ASSETS WITH THIS MONEY IT HELPS DRIVE UP ASSET PRICES WHICH MAKES PEOPLE MORE CREDITWORTHY
YOU1000000115_S0000255	HOWEVER THIS ONLY HELPS THOSE WHO OWN FINANCIAL ASSETS YOU SEE THE CENTRAL BANK CAN PRINT MONEY BUT IT CAN ONLY BUY FINANCIAL ASSETS
YOU1000000115_S0000256	THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT ON THE OTHER HAND CAN BUY GOODS AND SERVICES AND PUT MONEY IN THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE BUT IT CAN'T PRINT MONEY
YOU1000000115_S0000257	SO IN ORDER TO STIMULATE THE ECONOMY THE TWO MUST COOPERATE
YOU1000000115_S0000258	BY BUYING GOVERNMENT BONDS THE CENTRAL BANK ESSENTIALLY LENDS MONEY TO THE GOVERNMENT ALLOWING IT TO RUN A DEFICIT AND INCREASE SPENDING
YOU1000000115_S0000259	ON GOODS AND SERVICES THROUGH ITS STIMULUS PROGRAMS AND ONEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS
YOU1000000115_S0000260	THIS INCREASES PEOPLE'S INCOME AS WELL AS THE GOVERNMENT'S DEBT HOWEVER IT WILL LOWER THE ECONOMY'S TOTAL DEBT BURDEN
YOU1000000115_S0000261	THIS IS A VERY RISKY TIME POLICYMAKERS NEED TO BALANCE THE FOUR WAYS THAT DEBT BURDENS COME DOWN
YOU1000000115_S0000263	THE DEFLATIONARY WAYS NEED TO BALANCE WITH THE INFLATIONARY WAYS IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN STABILITY
YOU1000000115_S0000264	IF BALANCED CORRECTLY THERE CAN BE A BEAUTIFUL DELEVERA
YOU1000000115_S0000266	YOU SEE A DELEVERAGING CAN BE UGLY OR IT CAN BE BEAUTIFUL HOW CAN A DLEVERAGING BE BEAUTIFUL
YOU1000000115_S0000268	EVEN THOUGH ADE LEVERAGING IS A DIFFICULT SITUATION HANDLING A DIFFICULT SITUATION IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY IS BEAUTIFUL
YOU1000000115_S0000269	A LOT MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE DEBT FUELED UNBALANCED EXCESSES OF THE LEVERAGING PHASE
YOU1000000115_S0000270	IN A BEAUTIFUL DELEVERAGING DEBTS DECLINE RELATIVE TO INCOME REAL ECONOMIC GROWTH IS POSITIVE AND INFLATION ISN'T A PROBLEM
YOU1000000115_S0000271	IT IS ACHIEVED BY HAVING THE RIGHT BALANCE THE RIGHT BALANCE REQUIRES A CERTAIN MIX OF CUTTING SPENDING REDUCING DEBT
YOU1000000115_S0000273	TRANSFERRING WEALTH AND PRINTING MONEY SO THAT ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL STABILITY CAN BE MAINTAINED
YOU1000000115_S0000274	PEOPLE ASK IF PRINTING MONEY WILL RAISE INFLATION IT WON'T IF IT OFFSETS FALLING CREDIT
YOU1000000115_S0000275	REMEMBER SPENDING IS WHAT MATTERS A DOLLAR OF SPENDING PAID FOR WITH MONEY HAS THE SAME EFFECT ON PRICE AS A DOLLAR OF SPENDING PAID FOR WITH CREDIT
YOU1000000115_S0000277	BY PRINTING MONEY THE CENTRAL BANK CAN MAKE UP FOR THE DISAPPEARANCE OF CREDIT WITH AN INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY
YOU1000000115_S0000278	IN ORDER TO TURN THINGS AROUND THE CENTRAL BANK NEEDS TO NOT ONLY PUMP UP INCOME GROWTH
YOU1000000115_S0000279	BUT GET THE RATE OF INCOME GROWTH HIGHER THAN THE RATE OF INTEREST ON THE ACCUMULATED DEBT
YOU1000000115_S0000280	SO WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT BASICALLY INCOME NEEDS TO GROW FASTER THAN DEBT GROWS
YOU1000000115_S0000281	FOR EXAMPLE LET'S ASSUME THAT A COUNTRY GOING THROUGH A DELEVERAGING HAS A DEBT TO INCOME RATIO OF A HUNDRED PERCENT
YOU1000000115_S0000282	THAT MEANS THAT THE AMOUNT OF DEBT IT HAS IS THE SAME AS THE AMOUNT OF INCOME THE ENTIRE COUNTRY MAKES IN A YEAR
YOU1000000115_S0000283	NOW THINK ABOUT THE INTEREST RATE ON THAT DEBT LET'S SAY IT'S TWO PERCENT
YOU1000000115_S0000284	IF DEBT IS GROWING AT TWO PERCENT BECAUSE OF THAT INTEREST RATE AND INCOME IS ONLY GROWING AT AROUND ONE PERCENT YOU WILL NEVER REDUCE THE DEBT BURDEN
YOU1000000115_S0000285	YOU NEED TO PRINT ENOUGH MONEY TO GET THE RATE OF INCOME GROWTH ABOVE THE RATE OF INTEREST
YOU1000000115_S0000286	HOWEVER PRINTING MONEY COULD EASILY BE ABUSED BECAUSE IT'S SO EASY TO DO AND PEOPLE PREFER IT TO THE ALTERNATIVES
YOU1000000115_S0000287	THE KEY IS TO AVOID PRINTING TOO MUCH MONEY AND CAUSING UNACCEPTABLY HIGH INFLATION THE WAY GERMANY DID DURING ITS DELEVERAGING IN THE NINETEEN TWENTY S
YOU1000000115_S0000288	IF POLICYMAKERS ACHIEVE THE RIGHT BALANCE A DELEVERAGING ISN'T SO DRAMATIC GROWTH IS SLOW BUT DEBT BURDENS GO DOWN
YOU1000000115_S0000289	THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL DELEVERAGING WHEN INCOMES BEGIN TO RISE BORROWERS BEGIN TO APPEAR MORE CREDIT WORTHY
YOU1000000115_S0000290	AND WHEN BORROWERS APPEAR MORE CREDITWORTHY LENDERS BEGIN TO LEND MONEY AGAIN DEBT BURDENS FINALLY BEGIN TO FALL
YOU1000000115_S0000291	ABLE TO BORROW MONEY PEOPLE CAN SPEND MORE EVENTUALLY THE ECONOMY BEGINS TO GROW AGAIN LEADING TO THE REFLATION PHASE OF THE LONG TERM DEBT CYCLE
YOU1000000115_S0000292	THOUGH THE DELEVERAGING PROCESS CAN BE HORRIBLE IF HANDLED BADLY IF HANDLED WELL IT WILL EVENTUALLY FIX THE PROBLEM
YOU1000000115_S0000293	IT TAKES ROUGHLY A DECADE OR MORE FOR DEBT BURDENS TO FALL AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITY TO GET BACK TO NORMAL HENCE THE TERM LOST DECADE
YOU1000000115_S0000294	IN CLOSING OF COURSE THE ECONOMY IS A LITTLE BIT MORE COMPLICATED THAN THIS TEMPLATE SUGGESTS
YOU1000000115_S0000295	HOWEVER LAYING THE SHORT TERM DEBT CYCLE ON TOP OF THE LONG TERM DEBT CYCLE AND THEN LAYING BOTH OF THEM ON TOP OF THE PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH LINE
YOU1000000115_S0000296	GIVES A REASONABLY GOOD TEMPLATE FOR SEEING WHERE WE'VE BEEN WHERE WE ARE NOW AND WHERE WE'RE PROBABLY HEADED
YOU1000000115_S0000297	SO IN SUMMARY THERE ARE THREE RULES OF THUMB THAT I'D LIKE YOU TO TAKE AWAY FROM THIS
YOU1000000115_S0000298	FIRST DON'T HAVE DEBT RISE FASTER THAN INCOME BECAUSE YOUR DEBT BURDENS WILL EVENTUALLY CRUSH YOU
YOU1000000115_S0000299	SECOND DON'T HAVE INCOME RISE FASTER THAN PRODUCTIVITY BECAUSE YOU'LL EVENTUALLY BECOME UNCOMPETITIVE
YOU1000000115_S0000300	AND THIRD DO ALL THAT YOU CAN TO RAISE YOUR PRODUCTIVITY BECAUSE IN THE LONG RUN THAT'S WHAT MATTERS MOST
YOU1000000115_S0000301	THIS IS SIMPLE ADVICE FOR YOU AND IT'S SIMPLE ADVICE FOR POLICYMAKERS
YOU1000000115_S0000302	YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED BUT MOST PEOPLE INCLUDING MOST POLICYMAKERS DON'T PAY ENOUGH ATTENTION TO THIS
YOU1000000115_S0000303	THIS TEMPLATE HAS WORKED FOR ME AND I HOPE IT WILL WORK FOR YOU THANK YOU
YOU1000000116_S0000000	AS WE BEGIN OUR JOURNEY INTO THE WORLD OF ECONOMICS I THOUGHT I WOULD BEGIN WITH A QUOTE FROM ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS ECONOMISTS OF ALL TIME
YOU1000000116_S0000001	THE SCOTTISH PHILOSOPHER ADAM SMITH AND HE REALLY IS KIND OF THE FIRST REAL ECONOMIST IN IN THE WAY THAT WE VIEW IT NOW AND THIS IS FROM HIS
YOU1000000116_S0000002	THE WEALTH OF NATIONS PUBLISHED IN SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SIX COINCIDENTALLY THE SAME YEAR'S THE AMERICAN DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE
YOU1000000116_S0000003	AND IT'S ONE OF HIS THE MOST FAMOUS EXCERPTS HE GENERALLY INDEED HE BEING AN ECONOMIC ACTOR NEITHER INTENDS TO PROMOTE THE PUBLIC INTEREST NOR KNOWS HOW MUCH HE IS PROMOTING IT
YOU1000000116_S0000004	BY DIRECTING THAT INDUSTRY SO THE INDUSTRY IN CONTROL OF THAT INDIVIDUAL ACTOR IN SUCH A MANNER AS ITS PRODUCE MAY BE OF THE GREATEST VALUE HE INTENDS ONLY HIS OWN GAIN
YOU1000000116_S0000005	HE INTENDS ONLY HIS OWN GAIN AND HE IS IN THIS AS IN MANY OTHER CASES LED BY AN INVISIBLE HAND TO PROMOTE AND D
YOU1000000116_S0000006	WHICH WAS NO PART OF HIS INTENTION AND THIS TERM INVISIBLE HAND IS FAMOUS LED BY AN INVISIBLE HAND TO PROMOTE AND END
YOU1000000116_S0000007	WHICH WAS NO PART OF HIS INTENTION HE'S SAYING LOOK WHEN INDIVIDUAL ACTORS JUST ACT IN THEIR OWN SELF INTEREST THAT OFTEN AN AGGREGATE LEADS TO THINGS THAT EACH OF THOSE INDIVIDUAL ACTORS DID NOT INTEND
YOU1000000116_S0000008	AND THEN HE SAYS NOR IS IT ALWAYS THE WORSE FOR SOCIETY THAT IT WAS NO PART OF IT SO IT'S NOT ALWAYS NECESSARILY A BAD THING BY PURSUING HIS OWN INTEREST
YOU1000000116_S0000009	HE FREQUENTLY PROMOTES THAT OF THE SOCIETY MORE EFFECTUALLY THAN WHEN HE REALLY INTENDS TO PROMOTE IT SO THIS IS A PRETTY STRONG STATEMENT
YOU1000000116_S0000010	S REALLY AT THE CORE OF CAPITALISM AND THAT'S WHY I POINT OUT THAT IT WAS PUBLISHED THE SAME YEAR S THE AMERICAN DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY
YOU1000000116_S0000011	AMERICA THE FOUNDING FATHERS THEY WROTE THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE THE CONSTITUTION IT REALLY TALKS ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY WHAT ARE THE RIGHTS OF ITS CITIZENS
YOU1000000116_S0000012	BUT THE UNITED STATES IN ITS OVERALL THE OVERALL EXPERIENCE OF AN AMERICAN IS AT LEAST AS INFLUENCED BY THE WORK OF ADAM SMITH
YOU1000000116_S0000013	BY THESE KIND OF FOUNDATIONAL IDEAS OF CAPITALISM AND THEY JUST BOTH HAPPENED TO HAPPEN AROUND THE SAME TIME
YOU1000000116_S0000014	BUT THIS IDEA I'S NOT ALWAYS THAT INTUITIVE INDIVIDUAL ACTORS BY BY ESSENTIALLY PURSUING THEIR OWN SELF INTERESTED ENDS MIGHT BE DOING MORE FOR SOCIETY
YOU1000000116_S0000015	THEN WHEN THEY THEN IF ANY OF THEM ACTUALLY TRY TO PROMOTE THE OVERALL WELL BEING OF SOCIETY AND I DON'T THINK ADAM SMITH WOULD SAY THAT IT'S ALWAYS GOOD
YOU1000000116_S0000016	SOMEONE TO ACT SELF INTERESTED OR THAT IT'S NEVER GOOD FOR PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY THINK ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN AN AGGREGATE SENSE BUT HE'S SAYING THAT FREQUENTLY
YOU1000000116_S0000017	FREQUENTLY THIS SELF INTERESTED ACTION COULD LEAD TO THE GREATER GOOD COULD LEAD TO MORE INNOVATION COULD LEAD TO BETTER INVESTMENT
YOU1000000116_S0000018	COULD LEAD TO MORE PRODUCTIVITY COULD LEAD TO MORE WEALTH MORE MORE A LARGER PIE FOR EVERYONE
YOU1000000116_S0000019	AND NOW ECONOMICS IS FREQUENTLY AND AND WHEN HE MAKES A STATEMENT HE'S ACTUALLY MAKING A MIX OF A MICROECONOMIC AND A MACROECONOMIC STATEMENT
YOU1000000116_S0000020	MICRO IS THAT PEOPLE INDIVIDUAL ACTORS ARE ACTING IN THEIR OWN SELF INTEREST AND THE MACRO IS THAT IT MIGHT BE GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY OR FOR THE NATION AS A WHOLE
YOU1000000116_S0000021	AND SO NOW MODERN ECONOMISTS TEND TO DIVIDE THEMSELVES INTO THESE TWO SCHOOLS OR INTO THESE TWO SUBJECTS MICROECONOMICS
YOU1000000116_S0000023	MICROECONOMICS WHICH IS THE STUDY OF INDIVIDUAL ACTORS MICROECONOMICS AND THOSE ACTORS COULD BE FIRMS IT COULD BE PEOPLE IT COULD BE HOUSEHOLDS
YOU1000000116_S0000024	AND YOU HAVE MACROECONOMICS WHICH IS THE STUDY OF THE ECONOMY IN AGGREGATE MACRO
YOU1000000116_S0000026	ECONOMICS AND YOU GET IT FROM THEIR WORDS
YOU1000000116_S0000027	MICRO THE PREFIX REFERS TO VERY SMALL THINGS MACRO REFERS TO THE LARGER THE BIGGER PICTURE AND SO MICROECONOMICS JUST TO RESTATE IT IS IS ESSENTIALLY
YOU1000000116_S0000028	W ACTORS ACTORS MAKE DECISIONS MAKE DECISIONS OR I GUESS WE COULD SAY ALLOCATIONS ALLOCATIONS DECISIONS SLASH
YOU1000000116_S0000029	ALLOCATIONS ALLOCATIONS OF SCARCE RESOURCES AND YOU'RE GONNA HEAR THE WORD SCARCE RESOURCES A LOT WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT ECONOMICS
YOU1000000116_S0000030	AND A SCARCE RESOURCE IS ONE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE AN INFINITE AMOUNT OF FOR EXAMPLE LOVE MIGHT NOT BE A SCARCE RESOURCE YOU MIGHT HAVE AN INFINITE AMOUNT OF LOVE
YOU1000000116_S0000031	BUT A RESOURCE THAT WOULD BE SCARCE IS SOMETHING LIKE FOOD OR WATER OR MONEY OR TIME OR LABOR THESE ARE ALL SCARCE RESOURCES
YOU1000000116_S0000032	DSO MACROECONOMICS IS WELL HOW DO PEOPLE DECIDE WHERE TO PUT THOSE SCARCE RESOURCES HOW DO THEY DECIDE WHERE TO DEPLOY THEM AND HOW DOES THAT HOW DOES THAT AFFECT PRICES AND MARKETS AND WHATEVER ELSE
YOU1000000116_S0000033	MACROECONOMICS IS A STUDY OF OF WHAT HAPPENS IN AGGREGATE TO AN ECONOMY SO AGGREGATE WHAT HAPPENS IN AGGREGATE
YOU1000000116_S0000034	TO AN ECONOMY FROM THE MILLIONS OF INDIVIDUAL ACTORS AGGREGATE AGGREGATE ECONOMY WE HAVE NOW HAVE MILLIONS
YOU1000000116_S0000035	MILLIONS OF ACTORS AND IT OFTEN FOCUSES ON POLICY RELATED QUESTIONS SO DO YOU RAISE OR LOWER TAXES OR WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN YOU RAISE OR LOWER TAXES
YOU1000000116_S0000036	DO YOU REGULATE OR DEREGULATE HOW DOES THAT AFFECT THE OVERALL PRODUCTIVITY WHEN YOU DO THESE SO IT'S POLICY
YOU1000000116_S0000037	TOP TOP DOWN TOP DOWN QUESTIONS AND IN BOTH MACRO AND MICROECONOMICS THERE'S A THERE ESPECIALLY IN THE MODERN SENSE OF IT
YOU1000000116_S0000039	THERE'S AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE THEM RIGOROUS TO MAKE THEM MATHEMATICAL SO IN EITHER CASE YOU CAN START WITH SOME OF THE IDEAS SOME OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS OR THE LOGICAL IDEAS
YOU1000000116_S0000040	THATS SAY SOMEONE LIKE AN ADAM SMITH MIGHT HAVE SO YOU HAVE KIND OF YOU HAVE THESE AND THERE ARE BASIC IDEAS ABOUT ABOUT HOW PEOPLE THINK HOW PEOPLE MAKE DECISIONS
YOU1000000116_S0000041	SO PHILOSOPHY PHILOSOPHY OF OF PEOPLE OF DECISION MAKING IN THE CASE OF IN THE CASE OF MICRO ECONOMICS DECISION MAKING
YOU1000000116_S0000042	AND THEN YOU MAKE SOME ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT IT OR YOU SIMPLIFY IT SO I'LL DO THE RIGHT THIS YOU SIMPLIFY IT
YOU1000000116_S0000043	AND YOU REALLY ARE SIMPLIFYING YOU SAY OH ALL PEOPLE ARE RATIONAL OR ALL PEOPLE ARE GOINGNO ACT IN THEIR OWN SELF INTEREST OR ALL PEOPLE ARE GOING TO MAXIMIZE THEIR GAIN WHICH ISN'T RE
YOU1000000116_S0000044	HUMAN BEINGS ARE MOTIVATED BY A WHOLE BUNCH OF THINGS BUT YOU SIMPLIFY THESE THINGS SO THAT YOU CAN START TO DEAL WITH IT IN KIND OF A MATHEMATICAL WAY
YOU1000000116_S0000045	SO YOU SIMPLIFY IT SO YOU CAN START DEALING IT WITH IT IN A MATHEMATICAL SENSE AND THIS IS VALUABLE IT CAN CLARIFY YOUR THINKING IT CAN ALLOW YOU TO PROVE THINGS
YOU1000000116_S0000046	BASED ON YOUR ASSUMPTIONS AND SO AND YOU CAN START TO VISUALIZE THINGS MATHEMATICALLY WITH CHARTS AND GRAPHS AND THINK ABOUT WHAT WILL ACTUALLY HAPPEN WITH MARKET
YOU1000000116_S0000047	O IT'S VERY VERY VALUABLE TO HAVE THIS MATHEMATICAL RIGOROUS THINKING BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT CAN BE A LITTLE BIT DANGEROUS BECAUSE YOU'RE MAKING THIS HUGE SIMPLIFICATION
YOU1000000116_S0000048	AD SOMETIMES THE MATH MIGHT LEAD YOU TO SOME VERY STRONG CONCLUSIONS CONCLUSIONS WHICH YOU MIGHT FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE YOU PROVE YOU'VE PROVEN THE
YOU1000000116_S0000049	THE SAME WAY THAT YOU MIGHT PROVE RELATIVITY BUT THEY WERE BASED ON SOME SOME ASSUMPTIONS THAT EITHER MIGHT BE WRONG OR MIGHT BE OVER SIMPLIFICATIONS OR MIGHT NOT BE RELEVANT
YOU1000000116_S0000050	TO THE CONTEXT THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE CONCLUSIONS ABOUT SO IT'S VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO TAKE IT ALL WITH E GRAIN OF SALT TO REMEMBER THAT IT'S ALL BASED ON SOME SIMPLIFYING ASSUMPTIONS
YOU1000000116_S0000051	AND MACRO ECONOMICS IS PROBABLY EVEN MORE GUILTY OF IT IN MICROECONOMICS YOU'RE TAKING THESE DEEPLY COMPLICATED THINGS THE HUMAN BRAIN HOW PEOPLE ACT AND RESPOND TO EACH OTHER
YOU1000000116_S0000052	AND YOU'RE AND THEN YOU'RE AGGREGATING IT OVER MILLIONS OF PEOPLE SO IT'S ULTRACOMPLICATED YOU HAVE MILLIONS OF THESE INFINITELY COMPLICATED PEOPLE ALL INTERACTING WITH EACH OTHER SO
YOU1000000116_S0000053	IT'S VERY COMPLICATED MANY MILLIONS OF INTERACTIONS AND FUNDAMENTALLY UNPREDICTABLE INTERACTIONS AND THEN TRYING TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ON THOSE
YOU1000000116_S0000054	TRYING TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS AND THEN DOING AND THEN DOING MATH WITH THAT THAT COULD LEAD YOU TO SOME CONCLUSIONS OR MIGHT LEAD YOU TO SOME PREDICTIONS
YOU1000000116_S0000055	D ONCE AGAIN IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THIS IS VALUABLE IT'S VALUABLE TO MAKE THESE MATHEMATICAL MODELS TO MAKE THESE MATHEMATICAL ASSUMPTIONS THESE MATHEMATICAL CONCLUSIONS
YOU1000000116_S0000056	BUT IT ALWAYS NEEDS TO BE TAKEN WITH A GRAIN OF SALT AND SO THAT YOU HAVE A PROPER GRAIN OF SALT AND SO THAT YOU ARE ALWAYS FOCUSED ON THE TRUE INTUITION
YOU1000000116_S0000057	AND THAT'S REALLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO GET FROM A COURSE ON IOF ECONOMICS THAT YOU CAN TRULY REASON THROUGH WHAT'S LIKELY TO HAPPEN MAYBE EVEN WITHOUT THE MATHEMATICS
YOU1000000116_S0000058	I'LL LEAVE YOU WITH TWO QUOTES AND THESE QUOTES ARE A LITTLE BIT THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT FUNNY BUT THEY REALLY I THINK ARE HELPFUL THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND AS YOU START TO ESPECIALLY GO DEEP INTO THE MATHEMATICAL SIDE
YOU1000000116_S0000059	OF ECONOMICS SO THIS RITE OVER HERE IS A QUOTE BY ALFRED NOP WHO IS A PUBLISHER IN WHO IN THE NINETEEN HUNDREDS
YOU1000000116_S0000060	AN ECONOMIST IS A MAN WHO STATES THE OBVIOUS IN TERMS OF THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE AND I'M ASSUMING WHEN HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE HE'S REFERRING TO SOME OF THE MATHY STUFF THAT YOU SEE
YOU1000000116_S0000061	AN ECONOMICS AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL MAKE THIS AS COMPREHENSIBLE AS AS POSSIBLE AND SEE THAT THERE IS VALUE IN THIS BUT IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT STATEMENT HE'S MAKING
YOU1000000116_S0000062	OFTEN TIMES IT'S STATING A COMMON SENSE THING IT'S STATING SOMETHING THAT'S OBVIOUS IT'S OBVIOUS AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ALWAYS KEEP THAT IN MIND
YOU1000000116_S0000063	ALWAYS MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE INTUITION FOR WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE MATH OR TO KNOW WHEN THE MATH IS GOING IN A DIRECTION THAT MIGHT BE STRANGE BASED ON OVER SIMPLIFICATION
YOU1000000116_S0000064	OR WRONG ASSUMPTIONS AND THEN YOU HAVE THIS QUOTE OVER HERE BY LAWRENCE J PETER MOST FAMOUS FOR PETER'S PRINCIPLE HES PROFESSOR AT USC
YOU1000000116_S0000065	AN ECONOMIST IS AN EXPERT WHO WILL KNOW TOMORROW WHY THE THINGS HE PREDICTED YESTERDAY DIDN'T HAPPEN TODAY AND ONCE AGAIN IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN THE BACK OF ONE'S MIND
YOU1000000116_S0000066	BECAUSE ESPECIALLY AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY RELEVANT TO MACROECONOMICS BECAUSE IN MACROECONOMICS THERE'S ALL SORTS OF PREDICTIONS ABOUT THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY
YOU1000000116_S0000067	HAT NEEDS TO BE DONE HOW LONG WILL THE RECESSION LAST WHAT WILL BE THE ECONOMIC GROWTH NEXT YEAR WHAT WILL INFLATION DO AND THEY OFTEN PROVE TO BE WRONG
YOU1000000116_S0000068	FACT FEW ECONOMISTS EVEN TEND TO AGREE ON MANY OF THESE THINGS AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT BECAUSE OFTENTIMES WHEN YOU'RE DEEP IN THE MATHEMATICS OF THE ECONOMICS IT MIGHT SEEM
YOU1000000116_S0000069	TO BE A SCIENCE LIKE PHYSICS BUT IT'S NOT A SCIENCE LIKE PHYSICS THERE 'S OPEN IT IS OPEN TO SUBJECTIVITY
YOU1000000116_S0000070	A LOT OF THAT SUBJECTIVITY IS ALL AROUND IS ALL AROUND THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT YOU CHOOSE TO MAKE
YOU1000000117_S0000000	ALL RIGHT I THINK WE'RE AT TIME SO LET'S GET STARTED WELCOME TO FOLKS I DON'T KNOW I'M DR LORI SANTOS A PROFESSOR HERE AT YALE UNIVERSITY
YOU1000000117_S0000001	AND THE TEACHER OF THE SCIENCE OF WELLBEING COURSE ON COURSERA DOT ORG AND THE HOST OF THE HAPPINESS LAB PODCAST
YOU1000000117_S0000002	WE WANTED TO DO THIS FACEBOOK LIVE EVENT TODAY BECAUSE I KNOW ALL OF YOU ARE STRUGGLING WITH COVID NINETEEN
YOU1000000117_S0000003	AND ALL THE ANXIETIES AND THE UNCERTAINTIES THAT COME WITH IT WE KNOW OF COURSE ALL THE PHYSICAL THINGS WE NEED TO DO TO PROTECT OUR PHYSICAL HEALTH RIGHT WE SHOULD BE WASHING OUR HANDS AND SOCIALLY DISTANCING AND SO ON
YOU1000000117_S0000004	BUT I THINK A LOT OF US ARE STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW WITH THE KINDS OF THINGS WE SHOULD BE DOING TO PROTECT OUR MENTAL HEALTH
YOU1000000117_S0000005	AND WE NEED TO BE JUST AS INTENTIONAL ABOUT PROTECTING OUR OWN ANXIETIES AND DEPRESSIONS AND SORT OF FIXING THAT AS WE ARE PROTECTING OUR PHYSICAL HEALTH
YOU1000000117_S0000006	AND THIS CALL TODAY IS TO ANSWER ALL YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT SCIENCE SUGGESTS THAT WE CAN DO TO PROMOTE OUR MENTAL HEALTH IN THIS CHALLENGING TIME
YOU1000000117_S0000007	WHAT I'M GON TO BE DOING IS ANSWERING ALL OF YOUR QUESTIONS SO PLEASE BE SENDING THEM IN ON THE SIDE
YOU1000000117_S0000008	IF YOU HAVEN'T YET SENT US AN EMOJI TO LET US KNOW YOU'RE THERE PLEASE LET US KNOW
YOU1000000117_S0000009	AND I THINK SINCE WE HAVE SUCH A SHORT TIME I THINK WE'RE JUST GOING TO JUMP RIGHT INTO IT
YOU1000000117_S0000010	YOU'LL SEE ME KIND OF LOOKING OVER AT THE SIDE ON MY CHAT SCREEN TO SEE WHAT THE QUESTIONS ARE
YOU1000000117_S0000011	AND THE FIRST QUESTION WE HAVE TODAY IS FROM ELIZABETH WHO ASKS DO YOU HAVE ANY ADVICE ON DEALING WITH OR REDUCING TENSION AND ARGUING IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP DURING THESE STAY AT HOME ORDERS
YOU1000000117_S0000012	THIS ONE'S A BIG ONE I THINK YOU'RE SPEAKING TO ME I THINK A LOT OF US ARE FACING THE CHALLENGE RIGHT NOW
YOU1000000117_S0000013	THT WE'RE SPENDING MORE TIME WITH OUR SPOUSES WITH OUR PARTNERS WITH OUR KIDS
YOU1000000117_S0000014	AND THAT CAN BE INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING NORMALLY BUT IT'S ESPECIALLY CHALLENGING IN AN OTHERWISE ANXIETY PROVOKING TIME
YOU1000000117_S0000015	AND SO I THINK THE FIRST PIECE OF ADVICE I HAVE IS TO JUST VALIDATE THAT LIKE YEAH THIS IS A BIG THING THAT WE'RE ALL STRUGGLING WITH
YOU1000000117_S0000016	BUT THEN TO SORT OF ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO BE A LITTLE BIT PATIENT
YOU1000000117_S0000017	THE RESEARCH ON RELATIONSHIPS AND WHAT ALLOWS RELATIONSHIPS TO SUCCEED FOLKS LIKE PROFESSOR ELI FINKEL AND OTHERS
YOU1000000117_S0000018	THEY REALLY SUGGEST THAT A LOT OF OUR RELATIONSHIP' SUCCESS HAS TO DO WITH OUR EXPECTATIONS
YOU1000000117_S0000019	AND I THINK IF ANYTHING WE MIGHT WANT TO JUST BE A LITTLE CHILLER ABOUT OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR OUR SPOUSES THAN WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN BEFORE
YOU1000000117_S0000020	ALL OF US ARE GOING THROUGH THIS STRUGGLING TIME AND SO IF YOU HAVE A SPOUSE WHO SAY YOU KNOW DIDN'T EMPTY THE DISHWASHER OR ISN'T DOING THEIR PART AS MUCH WITH KIDS
YOU1000000117_S0000021	I THINK THIS IS A TIME TO BE COMPASSIONATE BOTH WITH THEM AND WITH YOURSELF
YOU1000000117_S0000022	AND TO KIND OF DOWNGRADE EXPECTATIONS A LITTLE BIT
YOU1000000117_S0000023	BUT THE PARTICULAR ADVICE I WOULD GIVE IS IF YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR SPOUSE THERE'S ALWAYS THINGS THAT WE REALLY LOVE ABOUT OUR SPOUSE THAT THAT AS IN A RELATIONSHIP WE DO VERY VERY WELL TOGETHER
YOU1000000117_S0000024	AND THIS IS THE TIME TO DOUBLE DOWN ON THOSE GOOD THINGS
YOU1000000117_S0000025	SO IF YOU BOTH CONNECT IN TERMS OF HANGING OUT WITH THE KIDS AND WORKING WITH THE KIDS THAT'S A TIME TO DOUBLE DOWN ON
YOU1000000117_S0000026	YOU BOTH CONNECT ON HUMOR YOU KNOW NOW 'S THE TIME TO BE WATCHING A COMEDY MOVIE TOGETHER
YOU1000000117_S0000027	AND SO THE BASIC ADVICE IS TO KIND OF SHOW THEM AND YOURSELF A LITTLE COMPASSION LIKE NOW IS THE TIME TO KIND OF DOWNREGULATE YOUR EXPECTATIONS
YOU1000000117_S0000028	BUT ALSO IF THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE GOOD IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP BE VERY INTENTIONAL ABOUT PROMOTING THOSE IN THIS TOUGH TIME
YOU1000000117_S0000029	THAT SOMETIMES REQUIRES A LITTLE CREATIVITY YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE THE THING YOU'RE GREAT WITH WITH YOUR SPOUSE IS GOING OUT TO DINNER AND HAVING THESE WONDERFUL OUTDOOR DATES
YOU1000000117_S0000030	YOU MIGHT NEED TO GET CREATIVE BUT WITH A LITTLE CREATIVITY YOU CAN REALLY PATCH UP A RELATIONSHIP
YOU1000000117_S0000031	AND KIND OF DOWNREGULATE THE STRESS THAT WE SEE
YOU1000000117_S0000032	REMEMBER IN NATURAL DISASTERS IT IS A TIME THAT WE SEE THINGS LIKE DIVORCE RATES INCREASING
YOU1000000117_S0000033	BUT IT'S ALSO THE TIME THAT WE SEE NEW RELATIONSHIPS FORMING PEOPLE MAKING BABIES
YOU1000000117_S0000034	IT REALLY DEPENDS ON YOUR INTENTIONAL EFFORTS YOU CAN MAKE THIS CHALLENGING TIME BETTER IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP
YOU1000000117_S0000035	SO THAT WAS ELIZABETH'S QUESTION NEXT QUESTION WE HAVE UP IS FROM MELISSA
YOU1000000117_S0000036	SHE ASKS HOW DO WE STAY INFORMED WITH CURRENT AND UPDATED NEWS WITHOUT INCREASING OUR ANXIOUS FEELINGS WE MAY HAVE
YOU1000000117_S0000037	THIS IS ANOTHER ONE I'M STRUGGLING WITH AS WELL LIKE LIKE YOU I WANT TO BE INFORMED ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN MY TOWN YOU KNOW WHAT HAS THE PRESIDENT SAID RECENTLY AND SO ON
YOU1000000117_S0000038	BUT I FEEL LIKE EVERY TIME I WATCH THE NEWS I CAN WATCH MY ANXIETY SKYROCKET
YOU1000000117_S0000039	IN TERMS OF WHAT ANXIETY FEELS LIKE IN THE BODY FOR ME THAT'S WATCHING MY CHEST CONSTRICT I'M WATCHING MYSELF BREATHE FASTER IT JUST KIND OF DOESN'T FEEL GOOD
YOU1000000117_S0000040	AND SO THIS IS A REAL CHALLENGE OF HOW TO STAY INFORMED WITHOUT CREATING MORE ANXIETY
YOU1000000117_S0000041	THE WAY I'VE BEEN ABLE TO SOLVE IT MYSELF IS TO KIND OF DO THAT PAYING ATTENTION THAT MINDFULNESS ABOUT WHAT THE NEWS IS MAKING ME FEEL
YOU1000000117_S0000042	AND THERE'S TIMES WHEN IT FEELS LIKE INFORMATION AND THERE'S TIMES WHEN IT FEELS LIKE I'M ALREADY REALLY ANXIOUS
YOU1000000117_S0000043	I DON'T WANT TO ADD TO THAT BY ADDING ANY MORE NEWS ONTO IT
YOU1000000117_S0000044	AND SO I THINK THE KEY IS TO JUST BE REALLY DELIBERATE ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE CONSUMING
YOU1000000117_S0000045	AND ALSO TO HAVE SOME CHOICE ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE CONSUMING YOU CAN PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT'S GOING ON BUT TRY TO UPREGULATE THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE POSITIVE NEWS
YOU1000000117_S0000046	SO FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A WONDERFUL HASHTAG ON TWITTER CALLED COVID KINDNESS WHICH YOU CAN USE TO CHECK OUT TO SEE ALL THE GOOD THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING OUT THERE
YOU1000000117_S0000047	AND SO I THINK TRYING TO BALANCE SOME OF THE DOOM AND GLOOM THAT YOU'RE SEEING WITH SOME OF THE POSITIVE THINGS CAN BE REALLY POWERFUL
YOU1000000117_S0000048	BUT BUT HONESTLY WHAT I'VE DONE MYSELF IS TO REALLY DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF NEWS THAT I'M CONSUMING
YOU1000000117_S0000049	PARTICULARLY BEFORE I GO TO BED I NOW HAVE A RULE LIKE BASICALLY PAST SIX OR SEVEN PM
YOU1000000117_S0000050	I PUT MY PHONE AWAY I'M NOT ON SOCIAL MEDIA AS MUCH I'M REALLY TRYING TO NOT BE CONSUMING THE NEWS AT THAT TIME
YOU1000000117_S0000051	BECAUSE I'M WATCHING IT MINDFULLY AND NOTICING THAT IT'S AFFECTING MY SLEEP
YOU1000000117_S0000052	MOST OF THAT INFORMATION IS GOING TO BE THERE THE NEXT MORNING AND SO FIND WAYS TO PROTECT YOUR SLEEP AND TO PROTECT YOUR OWN ANXIETY LEVELS
YOU1000000117_S0000053	AND IT'S OKAY AND BE SELF COMPASSIONATE IF YOU NEED TO AVOID SOME OF THAT STUFF
YOU1000000117_S0000054	AGAIN THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR NEWS CYCLE IS GOIN TO BE BACK WHEN YOU LOOK AGAIN YOU'RE NOT GOIN TO MISS TOO MUCH
YOU1000000117_S0000056	AND SO NEXT QUESTION U THIS COMES FROM A BUNCH OF FOLKS LEE AND JENNA AND ANNA ALL ASKING SIMILAR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS FOR FRONTLINE WORKERS
YOU1000000117_S0000057	THEY ASK BASICALLY HOW CAN FRONTLINE WORKERS AND HEALTHCARE WORKERS GENERALLY PRACTICE SELFH CARE AND COMBAT ANXIETY YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO SUPPORT THESE WORKERS
YOU1000000117_S0000058	I'M SO GLAD THIS QUESTION CAME UP AND IT'S GREAT THAT IT CAME UP FROM SO MANY FOLKS
YOU1000000117_S0000059	BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I CARE ABOUT VERY DEEPLY I'M SO GRATEFUL THAT THERE ARE HEALTH CARE WORKERS OUT THERE REALLY RISKING THEIR HEALTH AND THEIR LIVES
YOU1000000117_S0000060	TO PROTECT ME AND MY FAMILY AND MY COMMUNITY AND SO THANK YOU WITH GRATITUDE FOR THE FACT THAT YOU'RE DOING THAT
YOU1000000117_S0000061	I THINK THERE ARE LOTS OF INTENTIONAL THINGS THAT EVEN FOLKS WHO ARE ON THE FRONT LINE CAN DO TO PROTECT THEIR MENTAL HEALTH IN THIS SCARY TIME
YOU1000000117_S0000062	ONE OF THOSE THINGS COMES FROM A REFOCUS THAT YOU REALLY NEED TO PROTECT YOUR OWN MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS DURING THIS TIME
YOU1000000117_S0000063	AND THAT MEANS EXPLICITLY TAKING TIME TO KIND OF PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR ANXIETY LEVELS AND WATCH THE THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO TO DEAL WITH THAT
YOU1000000117_S0000064	I THINK IN BETWEEN PATIENTSE IF YOU CAN GIVE YOURSELF A BREAK FOR SAY THREE CONSCIOUS BREATHS
YOU1000000117_S0000065	THREE VERY SLOW BREATHS WHERE YOU BREATHE INTO YOUR BELLY
YOU1000000117_S0000066	AND JUST KIND OF HAVE A MOMENT TO TAKE A SECOND AND BE PRESENT
YOU1000000117_S0000067	THOSE THINGS WILL DOWNREGULATE YOUR SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM IT WILL KICK IN THE PARASYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY THAT WE KNOW ALLOWS FOR KIND OF AREST AND DIGEST
YOU1000000117_S0000068	AND THE MORE YOU CAN SORT OF TAKE SHORT BREAKS TO DO THAT ALL THE MORE POWERFUL
YOU1000000117_S0000069	I THINK A SECOND THING I WOULD SAY FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE REFRAMING WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN AS POSITIVE A WAY AS POSSIBLE
YOU1000000117_S0000070	I MEAN ULTIMATELY YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING THAT'S INCREDIBLY BRAVE THAT'S HELPING FOLKS BUT SOMETIMES IN THE FRANTIC DAY TO DAY ANXIOUSNESS OF THAT YOU CAN LOSE THAT
YOU1000000117_S0000071	AND THERE'S LOTS OF RESEARCH BY FOLKS LIKE DAVID DISTENO AND OTHERS THAT SHOWS THAT TAKING TIME TO REALIZE THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS COMPASSIONATELY HELPING OTHER PEOPLE
YOU1000000117_S0000072	RECOGNIZING THAT IT'S A PRO SOCIAL ACTION CAN ACTUALLY ALLOW YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE RESILIENCE AND IT CAN ACTUALLY UPREGULATE WHAT'S CALLED YOUR SELF REGULATION YOUR ABILITY TO DO HARD THINGS
YOU1000000117_S0000073	AND SO I THINK KIND OF TURNING ON YOUR COMPASSION MUSCLES TURNING ON THIS IDEA THAT YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING PRO SOCIALLY CAN BE INCREDIBLY POWERFUL
YOU1000000117_S0000074	AND THE FINAL QUICK TIP THIS IS MORE OF A PRACTICE TIP BUT FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS RIGHT NOW IS THAT
YOU1000000117_S0000075	THERE'S LOTS OF EVIDENCE THAT SPECIFIC KINDS OF MEDITATION PRACTICES CAN REDUCE BURNOUT EVEN IN INCREDIBLY STRESSFUL TIMES
YOU1000000117_S0000076	THIS IS TRUE FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS BUT ALSO SERVICE PROVIDERS AND EVEN FOLKS LIKE WHO WORK AT THE GROCERY STORE WHO REALLY HAVE TO GIVE UP AND SACRIFICE RIGHT NOW TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE
YOU1000000117_S0000077	AND THE SPECIFIC KIND OF MEDITATION IS WHAT'S KNOWN AS LOVING KINDNESS MEDITATION OR METTA
YOU1000000117_S0000078	IT'S BASICALLY A MEDITATION PRACTICE WHERE YOU WORK ON PRACTICING COMPASSION YOU ACTUALLY THINK ABOUT DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE
YOU1000000117_S0000079	AND EXTEND TO THEM INFORMATION ABOUT BEING HAPPY AND HEALTHY
YOU1000000117_S0000080	ACTUALLY USE A MANTRA OF MAY YOU BE HAPPY MAY YOU BE HEALTHY
YOU1000000117_S0000081	BUT THE RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT THE SIMPLE ACT OF DOING THIS EVEN RARELY TEMPORARILY CAN ALLOW YOU TO FEEL COMPASSION THIS URGE TO HELP PEOPLE WITHOUT THE EMPATHY THAT GOES WITH
YOU1000000117_S0000082	IN OTHER WORDS WITHOUT THE KIND OF BURNOUT THAT COMES FROM FEELING THOSE OTHER PEOPLE'S EMOTIONS
YOU1000000117_S0000083	I THINK THIS CAN BE AN INCREDIBLY POWERFUL TECHNIQUE FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS RIGHT NOW AND YOU CAN START IT TODAY
YOU1000000117_S0000084	LOTS OF FREE APPS ONLINE FROM INSIGHTE TIMER TO CALM TO EVEN TEN PERCENT HAPPIER WITH DAN HARRIS THERE
YOU1000000117_S0000085	ALLOWING HEALTH CARE WORKERS TO USE THESE THINGS FREELY AVAILABLY
YOU1000000117_S0000086	AND THEY'RE ALLOWING THOSE HEALTH CARE WORKERS TO ACCESS LOVING KINDNESS MEDITATIONS SPECIFICALLY
YOU1000000117_S0000087	O JUMP ON AND DO ONE OF THESE MEDITATIONS EVEN FOR FIVE MINUTES IN THE MORNING YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE TAKING YOUR SHOWER
YOU1000000117_S0000088	IT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT CAN REALLY IMPROVE YOUR KIND OF RESILIENCE AND PROTECT YOU FROM BURNOUT LATER ON
YOU1000000117_S0000089	OKAY SO THAT WAS ABOUT HEALTH CARE WORKERS NOW WE HAVE A NEW TRUST QUESTION FROM TRACY
YOU1000000117_S0000090	TRACY ASKS HOW DO YOU KEEP YOURSELF POSITIVE DURING THIS TIME WHEN LIVING ALONE WHEN YOU'RE AWAY FROM YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS
YOU1000000117_S0000091	I THINK THIS ONE IS THE THE FLIP SIDE OF THE QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED EARLIER ABOUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THE STRESS OF LIVING WITH YOUR SPOUSE
YOU1000000117_S0000092	THERE'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF STRESS THAT COMES FROM LIVING ALONE AND BEING AWAY FROM FAMILY AND FRIENDS IN THIS REALLY HARD TIME
YOU1000000117_S0000093	AN I THINK THE ANSWER TO THIS ONE IS THAT YOU CAN BE PHYSICALLY ALONE WITHOUT BEING SOCIALLY ALONE
YOU1000000117_S0000094	IN OTHER WORDS YOU CAN BE USING TECHNOLOGY TO REACH OUT TO ALL THOSE FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS
YOU1000000117_S0000095	AND I THINK IN THIS SCARY TIME WE NEED TO BE DOING THIS EVEN MORE THAN EVER AND EVEN MORE INTENTIONALLY THAN EVER
YOU1000000117_S0000096	YOU KNOW IT'S ONE THING TO KIND OF BE HOME ALONE BUT IT'S ANOTHER TO KNOW THAT YOU HAVE YOU KNOW ZOOM YOGA CLASSES WITH FRIENDS OF YOURS
YOU1000000117_S0000097	OR A ZOOM DINNER DATE WITH YOUR PARENTS WHO ARE FAR AWAY IN DIFFERENT TIME ZONES
YOU1000000117_S0000098	THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS YOU CAN BUILD INTO YOUR DAY EVEN IF YOU'RE LIVING ALONE AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY CRITICAL
YOU1000000117_S0000099	ONE THING TO KNOW IS THAT THE SCIENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE ACT OF INTENTIONALLY CONNECTING IN REAL TIME OU KNOW KIND OF WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW WHERE ERE I'M TALKING TO YOU AND YOU'RE HEARING ME IN REAL TIME
YOU1000000117_S0000100	THAT CAN BE ALMOST AS GOOD AS A REGULAR SOCIAL CONNECTION AND SO WE SHOULD BE EMBRACING THESE A LOT MORE
YOU1000000117_S0000101	THINK ANOTHER THING YOU CAN DO IF YOU'RE LIVING ALONE IS TO EMBRACE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT SOLITUDE GIVES YOU IN TERMS OF OTHER MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS
YOU1000000117_S0000102	SO I'M THINKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE QUIET TIME FOR MEDITATION
YOU1000000117_S0000103	OR EVEN A LONE TIME SO THAT YOU CAN ENGAGE IN A LITTLE BIT MORE EXERCISE YOU KNOW
YOU1000000117_S0000104	GRAB A YOGA MAT EVEN FROM A SMALL APARTMENT AND DO ONE OF THE MANY FREE ONLINE EXERCISE CLASSES THAT ARE COMING NOW
YOU1000000117_S0000105	I THINK IF YOU'RE ALONE IN THIS CRISIS IT CAN ACTUALLY PROVIDE SOME TIME TO RESET THINGS AND FOCUS ON YOUR OWN MENTAL HEALTH
YOU1000000117_S0000106	IN A WAY THAT MIGHT BE TRICKY IF YOU'RE NOT SORT OF SHELTERING IN PLACE IN THAT VERY STRANGE SITUATION
YOU1000000117_S0000108	AND SO THAT WAS TRACY'S QUESTION NOW WE'RE MOVING ON TO BRIE BRIE IS ASKING HOW CAN WE STAY FOCUSED SANE AND PRODUCTIVE AT WORK
YOU1000000117_S0000109	PARTICULARLY WITH THE BIG ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM WHICH IS THE THREAT OF LAYOFFS
YOU1000000117_S0000110	THIS IS ANOTHER REALLY HUGE ONE AND I THINK I WANT TO START WITH THIS QUESTION FIRST BY VALIDATING IT
YOU1000000117_S0000111	YEAH A LOT OF US ARE FACING THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING LAID OFF FROM WORK HAVING LESS HOURS
YOU1000000117_S0000112	IN ADDITION TO THIS PHYSICAL HYPRE CRISIS AND THIS MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS A LOT OF US ARE FACING A REAL ECONOMIC CRISIS AND THAT'S INCREDIBLY SCARY
YOU1000000117_S0000113	AND SO I THINK THE FIRST THING IS TO JUST HAVE SOME SELF COMPASSION WITH YOURSELF ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH THIS
YOU1000000117_S0000114	I'M EXPERIENCING THIS NOW WITH MANY OF MY GRADUATE AND PH D STUDENTS
YOU1000000117_S0000115	WO FEEL LIKE OUKNOW THEY SHOULD BE WORKING AND BEING JUST AS PRODUCTIVE AS BEFORE BUT THAT CAN'T POSSIBLY BE TRUE BECAUSE WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC WHERE EVERYONE IS STRESSED
YOU1000000117_S0000116	AND EVEN IF WE'RE REACTING TO IT REALLY WELL ONE DAY THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE NEXT DAY WE WON'T FEEL IT REALLY DEEPLY AND BE UNABLE TO WORK
YOU1000000117_S0000117	AND SO I THINK THE FIRST PIECE OF ADVICE IS JUST TO ALLOW YOURSELF SOME SELF COMPASSION
YOU1000000117_S0000118	GIVE YOURSELF THE SAME SELF COMPASSION AS YOU WOULD GIVE TO A FRIEND WHO IS GOING THROUGH THAT SORT OF SAME THING
YOU1000000117_S0000119	ALL OF US RIGHT NOW ARE GOING TO BE A LITTLE LESS PRODUCTIVE THAN USUAL
YOU1000000117_S0000120	THE SECOND PIECE OF ADVICE IS ACTUALLY TO REMEMBER SOME OF THE CAUSAL ARROWS YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT ON THE PODCAST AND IN MY CLASS
YOU1000000117_S0000121	IN OTHER WORDS THAT WE OFTEN THINK THAT PRODUCTIVITY WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT FIRST AND THEN WE'LL BE HAPPY BECAUSE WE'LL BE PRODUCTIVE AT WORK
YOU1000000117_S0000122	BUT THE RESEARCH ACTUALLY SUGGESTS THE OTHER ARROW IN OTHER WORDS THAT BY FOCUSING ON OUR MENTAL HEALTH DURING THIS TIME IT CAN ACTUALLY INCREASE OUR PRODUCTIVITY
YOU1000000117_S0000123	AND SO THAT WOULD BE THE DIRECTION I SUGGEST YOU THINK ABOUT GOING WHAT CAN YOU DO TO REDUCE YOUR ANXIETY RIGHT NOW
YOU1000000117_S0000124	TO BUMP UP YOUR SOCIAL CONNECTIONS SO YOU FEEL A LITTLE BIT MORE LIKE CONNECTED AND TRUSTING ABOUT YOUR COMMUNITY
YOU1000000117_S0000125	WHAT UCAN YOU DO TO INCREASE A LITTLE BIT OF EXERCISE LATELY THOSE TYPES OF THINGS WILL BUMP UP YOUR MENTAL HEALTH
YOU1000000117_S0000126	AND BY FOCUSING ON THAT YOU'LL END UP INCREASING YOUR PRODUCTIVITY SEPARATELY
YOU1000000117_S0000127	AND SO THOSE WOULD BE MY KIND OF PRODUCTIVITY TIPS FIRST OF ALL JUST LIKE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE SAME
YOU1000000117_S0000128	NO ONE'S IS GONG TA BE THE SAME AND IN SOME WAYS THE WHOLE WORLD IS IN THIS BOAT
YOU1000000117_S0000129	SO KIND OF LAY OFF YOURSELF OF THE GUILT A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE WE'RE KIND OF ALL GOING THROUGH IT
YOU1000000117_S0000130	AND THE SECOND IS THAT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON PRODUCTIVITY YOU NEED TO GIVE YOURSELF SOME SPACE TO DO THE THINGS THAT WILL REALLY HELP YOUR MENTAL HEALTH TOO
YOU1000000117_S0000131	OKY SO THAT WAS FROM BRI NOW WE HAVE A SIMILAR QUESTION FROM ANGELA WHO'S ASKED MAYBE MORE SPECIFICALLY I'VE BEEN LAID OFF BECAUSE OF COVD NINETEEN
YOU1000000117_S0000132	HOW DO I DO THE SOUL SEARCHING NECESSARY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I WANT TO DO NEXT AND WHAT JOBS AND INDUSTRIES ARE GOING TO BE FULFILLING
YOU1000000117_S0000133	I THINK AGAIN THIS IS ONE OF THESE WAYS OF USING THE NEGATIVE THINGS IN LIFE TO SORT OF SEE THE BLESSINGS INSIDE OF THEM
YOU1000000117_S0000134	AGAIN YOU KNOW LOSING YOUR JOB IS AN AWFUL THING TO HAVE HAPPEN AND IT COMES WITH A LOT OF UNCERTAINTIES
YOU1000000117_S0000135	BUT IT ALSO BRINGS WITH IT THE POSSIBILITY OF NEW DIRECTIONS
YOU1000000117_S0000136	LIKE YOU CAN START THINKING MORE ABOUT WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU FOUND MEANINGFUL ABOUT YOUR JOB
YOU1000000117_S0000137	WHAT ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO BUILD INTO A JOB THAT'S COMING NEXT
YOU1000000117_S0000138	AGAIN SO MANY OF US ARE IN THIS CRISIS RIGHT NOW AND GOING THROUGH THESE THINGS
YOU1000000117_S0000139	BUT ALSO ALL OF US OR MOST OF US ARE GOING TO GET THROUGH TO THE OTHER SIDE
YOU1000000117_S0000140	WHEN WE'RE IN THE CRUCX OF IT IT'S HARD TO THINK THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER SIDE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE'RE JUST FACING THE UNCERTAINTY OF KIND OF YOU KNOW MONTHS INSIDE AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
YOU1000000117_S0000141	BUT LIKE ALL CRISES WE'RE GOING TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE
YOU1000000117_S0000142	AND EVEN THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE GOING THROUGH ECONOMIC AND OTHER STRIFES RIGHT NOW ARE GOING TO FIND OTHER OPTIONS WHEN YOU GET OUT
YOU1000000117_S0000143	AND I THINK YOU CAN USE THIS TIME TO DO SOME REAL SOUL SEARCHING
YOU1000000117_S0000144	ONE OF THE KIND OF BLESSINGS OF BEING IN A POSITION OF MAYBE LOSING YOUR JOB OR LOSING SOME HOURS AT WORK
YOU1000000117_S0000145	IS THAT YOU WIND UP HAVING A TIME WINDFALL YOU WIND UP HAVING MORE TIME
YOU1000000117_S0000146	AND THAT MEANS THAT YOU CAN HAVE THE BLESSING OF HAVING WHAT'S CALLED TIME AFFLUENCE THE SORT OF FEELING OF BEING WEALTHY IN TIME
YOU1000000117_S0000147	IF YOU CAN KIND OF GET AROUND THE UNCERTAINTY OF HAVING THE EXTRA TIME IT CAN ACTUALLY BE A REALLY POWERFUL TIME TO DO THINGS LIKE TAKE TIME TO JOURNAL ABOUT WHAT YOU FIND MOST MEANINGFUL
YOU1000000117_S0000148	OR ENGAGE IN THE KINDS OF STRATEGIES THAT RESEARCHERS LIKE AMY RESNISKI AND OTHER USES TO JOB CRAFT
YOU1000000117_S0000149	TO REALLY THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU FIND MOST MEANINGFUL IN YOUR WORK AND SORT OF PLAN THAT MOVING FORWARD
YOU1000000117_S0000150	IF YOU'RE TAKING THE CLASS ANGELA I WOULD ALSO SUGGEST THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO GO BACK TO THAT STRENGTH TEST THAT YOU MIGHT RECALL
YOU1000000117_S0000151	TRYING TO FOCUS ON YOUR CHARACTER STRENGTHS AND GETTING A SENSE OF WHAT THOSE ARE THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME TO FIGURE OUT WHAT PARTS OF YOUR WORK ARE MAPPING ONTO THOSE STRENGTHS
YOU1000000117_S0000152	AND IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WORK IN THE FUTURE WHAT YOU COULD DO THAT KIND OF BUILDS THOSE UP IN AN EVEN MORE ROBUST WAY
YOU1000000117_S0000153	SO THAT WAS A QUESTION FROM ANGELA WE'RE CRUISING THROUGH ALL THESE QUESTIONS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SENDING IN ALL THESE GREAT ONES
YOU1000000117_S0000154	THE NEXT ONE UP IS FROM JESSICA JESSICA NOTES I'VE BEEN DOING OKAY SO FAR BUT ONE OF MY CHILDREN HAS BEEN REALLY SAD ABOUT MISSING SCHOOL AND HIS FRIENDS IS THERE ANY WAY I CAN HELP HIM
YOU1000000117_S0000155	AND AGAIN JUST START BY JUST VALIDATING THIS YOU KNOW THIS IS A SCARY AND UNCERTAIN AND AN ANXIETY PROVOKING TIME FOR US
YOU1000000117_S0000156	IT'S SO MUCH WORSE FOR OUR CHILDREN RIGHT WHO WHO REALLY JUST DON'T HAVE THE KIND OF FRONTAL LOBE TOOLS TO REGULATE ABOUT THIS CRISIS
YOU1000000117_S0000157	SO I THINK ANYTHING YOU CAN DO TO HELP THEIR ANXIETY THEIR UNCERTAINTY CAN BE INCREDIBLY POWERFUL
YOU1000000117_S0000158	THE FIRST TIP I WOULD GIVE FOR HELPING KIDS DURING THIS TOUGH TIME IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE A ROUTINE
YOU1000000117_S0000159	ONE OF THE PROBLEMS ABOUT BEING OUT OF SCHOOL AND OUT OF THE TYPICAL DAY THAT KIDS FACE IS THAT THEY'RE USED TO HAVING A CERTAIN ROUTINE AND NOW IT'S GONE AWAY
YOU1000000117_S0000160	AND WE AS HUMANS ARE CREATURES OF HABIT LIKE WE KIND OF WORK BEST AND FEEL LESS ANXIOUS WHEN WE'RE IN A CONSISTENT SCHEDULE AND A CONSISTENT ROUTINE
YOU1000000117_S0000162	SO EVEN IF YOUR KIDS AREN'T IN A CONSISTENT SCHEDULE RIGHT NOW YOU SHOULD MAKE ONE UP FOR THEM
YOU1000000117_S0000163	YOU SHOULD FIND A WAY THAT YOU KNOW LIKE BREAKFAST IS FROM NINE TO TEN AND FROM TEN TO ELEVEN
YOU1000000117_S0000164	YOU KNOW YOU'RE DOING YOUR MATH HOMEWORK OR MAYBE YOU'RE WATCHING CARTOONS OR MAYBE YOU GET TO PLAY VIDEO GAMES IT KIND OF DOESN'T MATTER
YOU1000000117_S0000165	BUT JUST HAVE A CONSISTENT SCHEDULE THAT YOU END UP KIND OF ANNOUNCING TO YOUR KIDS AND STICKING WITH
YOU1000000117_S0000166	THE OTHER PIECE OF ADVICE I WOULD GIVE IS IS AGAIN TO TO DO THE SAME THING THAT WE NEED TO DO WHEN WE'RE FEELING ANXIOUS AND WE'RE FEELING STRESSED AND WE'RE FEELING SAD IN OTHER WORDS THE KIND OF SAME TYPES OF TIPS I WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT
YOU1000000117_S0000167	KIDS TOO CAN BENEFIT FROM HAVING SOCIAL CONNECTION THROUGH THINGS LIKE ZOOM AND SO ON
YOU1000000117_S0000168	FOR OLDER KIDS THAT CAN BE THE SAME WAY WE DO IT AS ADULTS
YOU1000000117_S0000169	BUT EVEN FOR YOUNGER KIDS THAT CAN BE THE KIND OF THING THAT YOU SET UP AND STRUCTURE
YOU1000000117_S0000170	MY COLLEAGUE JAMILE ZACKI WHO'S A SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGIST WHO WAS ON THE HAPPINESS LAB PODCAST
YOU1000000117_S0000171	HE HAS REALLY YOUNGER KIDS AND HE NOTES THAT HE AND HIS FRIENDS ARE SETTING UP PLAY DATES OVER ZOOM
YOU1000000117_S0000172	THEY'RE KIND OF GOING ONLINE AND PRINTING OUT THE SAME COLORING PAGES SO THAT KIDS CAN COLOR TOGETHER COLOR THE SAME THING
YOU1000000117_S0000173	ACROSS THE WAY ACROSS ZOOM AND THAT CAN BE REALLY POWERFUL KIND OF GIVING THIS STRUCTURE OF SOCIAL CONNECTION BACK TO YOUR KIDS WHEN THEY NEED IT
YOU1000000117_S0000174	BUT ANOTHER THING TO BUILD IN I THINK WOULD BE TO ALLOW KIDS TO SEE THAT AGAIN THIS ISN'T ALL DOOM AND GLOOM
YOU1000000117_S0000175	IF YOU LOOK LIKE THERE ARE HEROES AND REAL STORIES OF KINDNESS OUT THERE
YOU1000000117_S0000176	AND SO ANOTHER TIP WOULD BE TO KIND OF EXPOSE YOUR KIDS TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE GOOD THINGS HAPPENING
YOU1000000117_S0000177	HAV TELL THEM YOUR STORIES ABOUT COVID KINDNESS THAT YOU'RE READING ABOUT IN THE NEWS
YOU1000000117_S0000178	TALK TO THEM ABOUT THE HEROES THAT ARE DOING GREAT THINGS
YOU1000000117_S0000179	AND THTHE ALLOW THEM TO EXPERIENCE THE FACT THAT THERE'S GOOD STUFF OUT THERE AS WELL
YOU1000000117_S0000180	I THINK THE THIRD AND FINAL TIP IS THAT YOU KNOW YOU BEING THE HEAD OF THE HOUSE ARE GOING TO HAVE A HUGE EMOTIONAL IMPACT ON YOUR KIDS
YOU1000000117_S0000181	WE IF YOU'E LISTENED TO PAST EPISODES OF THE HAPPINESS LAB YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT CASES OF EMOTIONAL CONTAGION
YOU1000000117_S0000182	AND THE FACT THAT WE ARE OFTEN PART OF THESE AFFECTIVE SPIRALS
YOU1000000117_S0000183	WHERE ONE MEMBER OF OUR TEAM OR OUR FAMILIES FEELS A CERTAIN WAY FEELS PANICKY AND THEN THAT PANIC CAN BE CONTAGIOUS AND IT TRANSMITS AND IT GETS WORSE
YOU1000000117_S0000184	REMEMBER THAT YOU CAN BE THE CALM IN THE STORM FOR YOUR KIDS YOU KNOW IF YOU TAKE TIME TO REGULATE YOUR OWN ANXIETY YOU OW DO YOUR OWN DEEP BREATHS BEFORE YOU FACE THEM
YOU1000000117_S0000185	IF YOU'RE DESCRIBING THIS THIS SITUATION AS A CHALLENGE NOT A CRISIS YOU'RE GOING TO TRANSMIT THAT CALM AND THAT THOSE POSITIVE STATES TO THEM
YOU1000000117_S0000186	D THAT CAN BE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT YOU KNOW ONE OF THE BEST THINGS YOU CAN DO RIGHT NOW TO HELP YOUR COMMUNITY IS TO BE EMBODYING THOSE POSITIVE EMOTIONS YOURSELF
YOU1000000117_S0000187	AND THAT OFTEN MEANS DOING THE RIGHT THINGS TO PROTECT YOUR OWN WELL BEING THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT
YOU1000000117_S0000188	OKAY SO THAT WAS ONE FROM JESSICA NOW WE'RE MOVING ON TO ONE FROM LINSEY
YOU1000000117_S0000189	LINDSEY ASKS IN YOUR COURSE WE LEARNED ABOUT HOW EXPERIENCES AND NOT THINGS MAKE US HAPPY
YOU1000000117_S0000190	IN THIS TIME OF SOCIAL DISTANCING AND SELF QUARANTINE ARE THERE ANY SUGGESTIONS YOU HAVE FOR EXPERIENCES WE COULD CREATE INDEPENDENTLY OR WITH OUR FAMILIES
YOU1000000117_S0000191	I LOVE THIS QUESTION IN PART BECAUSE IT'S YOU KNOW DOING ALL THE THINGS THAT I SUGGEST RIGHT WHICH IS LIKE BEING PROACTIVE
YOU1000000117_S0000192	OU KNOW USING THE THE TOPICS THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT IN THE COURSE AND THE INTERVENTIONS WE'VE SEEN IN THE COURSE IN THIS SPECIAL TIME
YOU1000000117_S0000193	I THINK ONE OF THE ODD BUT GREAT THINGS ABOUT THIS CURRENT TIME IS THAT WE'RE ALL IN A NEW SITUATION
YOU1000000117_S0000194	LIKE WE'RE ALL FACED WITH BEING AT HOME IN A WAY WE HAVEN'T BEEN BEFORE WE HAVE MORE TIME WITH OUR KIDS MORE TIME WITH OUR FAMILIES AND THINGS LIKE AT
YOU1000000117_S0000195	ALL THE RESEARCH IN PSYCHOLOGY SUGGESTS THAT WE CAN HARNESS THESE NEW SITUATIONS TO FORM NEW DIFFERENT HABITS
YOU1000000117_S0000196	IN OTHER WORDS WE CAN START THINGS THAT WE HADN'T TRIED BEFORE YOU KNOW NEW GAME NIGHTS NEW FAMILY DINNERS NEW TRADITIONS
YOU1000000117_S0000197	ALL OF THESE THINGS BECAUSE WE'RE IN THIS MOMENT WHERE WE START A NEW SITUATION
YOU1000000117_S0000198	ARE EASY TO HARNESS WE CAN HARNESS WHAT ARE CALLED FRESH STARTS WHICH IS SOME WONDERFUL RESEARCH BY KATIE MILKMAN AND OTHERS
YOU1000000117_S0000199	SHOWS THAT THESE NEW SITUATIONS AND THESE NEW MOMENTS OF FRESH STARTS ALLOW US TO FORM HABITS BETTER
YOU1000000117_S0000200	AND SO I THINK THIS IS A TIME TO THINK ABOUT WHAT CREATIVE EXPERIENCES YOU COULD COME UP WITH WITH YOUR FAMILY
YOU1000000117_S0000201	YOU KNOW MAYBE YOU START COOKING DINNER WITH YOUR FAMILY IN A DIFFERENT WAY MAYBE YOU START ZOOMING YOU KNOW GRANDMA AND GRANDPA INTO YOUR ZOOM MEETING
YOU1000000117_S0000202	MAYBE YOU ALL ENGAGE IN A YOGA CLASS OR SOME CRAZY EXERCISE TOGETHER
YOU1000000117_S0000203	MAYBE THIS IS THE TIME TO START THAT GRATITUDE YOU KNOW THREE GOOD THINGS THAT YOU LIST BEFORE DINNER WITH YOUR FAMILY
YOU1000000117_S0000204	ALL THESE THINGS ARE EASIER TO START THE'RE EXPERIENCES THAT ARE EASIER TO GET GOING
YOU1000000117_S0000205	BECAUSE WE DON'T REALLY HAVE NORMS OF WHAT OUR FAMILIES ARE SUPPOSED TO DO DURING THIS TIME IT'S SO NEW
YOU1000000117_S0000206	AND THAT PROVIDES THIS REAL OPPORTUNITY IF YOU CAN HARNESS IT TO PUT GOOD THINGS IN PLACE FOR YOURSELF AND FOR YOUR FAMILY
YOU1000000117_S0000207	AND SO I THINK FOR THOSE EXPERIENCES YOU KNOW GET REALLY CREATIVE AN AND THAT CAN BE WITH YOUR KIDS BUT IT CAN ALSO BE WITH YOUR SPOUSES
YOU1000000117_S0000208	YOU KNOW WE CAN'T NECESSARILY GO OUT ON THE TYPICAL BORING DINNER DATES OR GO TO THAT SAME RESTAURANT YOU WENT TO EVERY SINGLE WEEK
YOU1000000117_S0000209	SO TRY SOMETHING NEW WHETHER THAT'S YOU KNOW A NEW LIKE SPOT IN THE HOUSE TO HAVE DINNER A NEW CANDLE LIKE PUT DOWN A TABLECLOTH LIKE TRY A NEW MEAL LIKE
YOU1000000117_S0000210	YOU CAN CREATE THESE NOVEL EXPERIENCES AND IF YOU FRAME THESE THINGS AS NOVEL EXPERIENCES THAT CAN BE POWERFUL FOR YOUR WELL BEING AS WELL
YOU1000000117_S0000211	OKAY SO THAT WAS LINDSEY'S QUESTION MOVING ON WE'RE WE'RE REALLY SCROLLING THROUGH SO I'M ENCOURAGING YOU AGAIN TO SEND IN YOUR QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVEN'T YET WE HAVE ABOUT TEN MORE MINUTES IN THIS CHAT SO SEND THEM IN
YOU1000000117_S0000212	NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM CHERRYLL AND CHERYLL ASKS WHAT SHOULD WE DO ABOUT SLEEP PROBLEMS I CAN'T SLEEP ANXIETY UNCERTAINTY ETCA
YOU1000000117_S0000213	SHERYLL YOU ARE REALLY SPEAKING TO ME BECAUSE I WAS GOING THROUGH THIS PRETTY BADLY ABOUT LAST WEEK
YOU1000000117_S0000214	WHEN I WAS JUST REALIZING THAT I JUST WAS UNABLE TO KIND OF FALL ASLEEP
YOU1000000117_S0000215	OW EVEN THOUGH I WAS TRYING TO GET TO BED AT A REASONABLE HOUR YOU KNOW MY MIND WAS IKE
YOU1000000117_S0000217	S REALLY REALLY HARD
YOU1000000117_S0000219	AND SO I'LL SHARE WITH YOU THE THINGS THAT I'VE DONE TO PROMOTE SLEEP AND THEY'RE ALL THINGS THAT COME FROM THE RESEARCH
YOU1000000117_S0000220	ONE OF THESE IS TO HARNESS THE POWER OF RITUAL BEFORE YOU GO TO SLEEP
YOU1000000117_S0000221	THERE'S LOTS OF FANTASTIC WORK BY MIKE NORTON AND FRANCHESCA GINO SHOWING THE POWER OF RITUAL TO CONTROL THINGS WHEN THINGS FEEL OUT OF CONTROL
YOU1000000117_S0000222	AND I THINK RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S PREVENTING US FROM SLEEPING IS THAT EVERYTHING FEELS REALLY OUT OF CONTROL
YOU1000000117_S0000223	AND SO I'VE STARTED SOME YOU KNOW SEEMINGLY DUMB LIKE PRIVATE SLEEP RITUALS YOU KNOW I KIND OF SIT UP AT NIGHT AND KIND OF REMAKE MY BED IF MY BED WASN'T MADE BEFORE
YOU1000000117_S0000224	I HAVE FOUND ALL THE OLD LIKE LOTIANS THAT I HAVE YOU KNOW IN MY CABINET THAT I HAVEN'T USED IN A WHILE AND
YOU1000000117_S0000225	LIKE EVERY NIGHT BEFORE I GO TO BED I KIND OF LIKE YOU KOW PUT SOME LOTION ON AND TRY TO BE REALLY MINDFUL ABOUT THE WAY IT SMELLS AND THE WAY IT FEELS AND KIND AOF GET INTO BED IT SOUNDS REALLY SILLY
YOU1000000117_S0000226	BUT HARNESSING THIS RITUAL THE SCIENCE SUGGESTS CAN KIND OF MAKE YOU FEEL A LITTLE BIT MORE IN CONTROL
YOU1000000117_S0000227	AND IT CAN ALSO TRAIN YOUR BODY THAT LIKE OH WAIT AFTER I DO THE RITUAL OF THE LOTION THEN I GO TO BED
YOU1000000117_S0000228	A SECOND THING THAT I'VE DONE AND THIS HIS PROBABLY BEEN EVEN MORE POWERFUL IS TO REALLY REGULATE HOW MUCH ANXIETY PROVOKING MATERIAL I'M LOOKING AT RIGHT BEFORE I GO TO BED
YOU1000000117_S0000229	I KNOW I'VE TOLD LOTS OF YOU ABOUT TETHE DANGERS OF PHONES AND PARTICULARLY THE DANGERS OF PHONES RIGHT BEFORE YOU GO TO SLEEP
YOU1000000117_S0000230	BUT THIS IS A TIME WHERE WE REALLY NEED TO BE FOLLOWING THAT ADVICE
YOU1000000117_S0000231	BASICALLY I HAVE A RULE NOW THAT AFTER EIGHT PM I PUT MY PHONE AWAY I JUST PUT IT ON SILENT
YOU1000000117_S0000232	PUT IT IN A SPECIFIC SPOT IN MY BEDROOM AND I'M NOT ALLOWED TO USE IT ANYMORE
YOU1000000117_S0000233	WHICH IS TRICKY FOR ME BECAUSE I'M REALLY USED TO KIND OF SCROLLING AND USING MY PHONE BEFORE I GO TO BED
YOU1000000117_S0000234	BUT I'VE TRIED TO SUBSTITUTE THAT HABIT WITH SOMETHING ELSE BECAUSE AS WE KNOW FROM OUR HABIT RESEARCH IF YOU HAVE A CUE BUT NO ACTION TO DO IT CAN BE REALLY HARD TO OVERCOME A BAD HABIT FROM BEFORE
YOU1000000117_S0000235	AND SO MY NEW MY NEW HABIT WHEN I HAVE THE CUE OF LIKE OH I REALLY WANT TO CHECK MY PHONE BEFORE BED IS A PHYSICAL BOOK I'VE JUST FOUND OLD BOOKS IN MY HOUSE THAT I EITHER WANT TO READ OR E'RE SITTING ON THAT SHELF AND I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO YET AND THOSE ARE THERE
YOU1000000117_S0000236	AND SO THOSE DIFFERENT HABITS OF KIND OF BEGINNING A SORT OF SLEEP RITUAL THAT'S LIKE HEALTHIER
YOU1000000117_S0000237	AND GETTING RID OF THE PHONE WHICH IS BAD BECAUSE OF ITS LIGHT BUT ALSO BECAUSE ON THE OTHER END OF THAT PHONE RIGHT NOW THERE'S A LOT OF ANXIETY PROVOKING CONTENT THAT CAN BE REALLY POWERFUL FOR ME
YOU1000000117_S0000238	AND I GUESS MAYBE THE THIRD THING IS JUST TO PRIORITIZE IT
YOU1000000117_S0000239	I'VE BEEN TRYING TO YOU KNOW GIVEN THAT WE ALL HAVE A LITTLE BIT MANY OF US HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY WITH OUR WORKTIME
YOU1000000117_S0000240	I'VE BEEN REALLY TRYING TO MOVE ANY WORK MEETINGS THAT ARE EARLY IN THE MORNING TO A LITTLE BIT LATER
YOU1000000117_S0000241	SO EVEN IF I CAN'T GET TO SLEEP OR I'M HAVING SOME RESTLESS SLEEP I HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO MAKE IT UP THESE DAYS
YOU1000000117_S0000242	AND SO HIGHLY HIGHLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO PRIORITIZE SLEEP REMEMBER SLEEP ESSENTIAL FOR YOUR MENTAL HEALTH BUT IT'S ALSO ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS YOU CAN DO RIGHT NOW TO PROTECT YOUR IMMUNE FUNCTION
YOU1000000117_S0000243	DURING A TIME WHEN WE ALL REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE OUR IMMUNE FUNCTION IS AS HIGH AND AS EFFECTIVE AS IT CAN POSSIBLY BE
YOU1000000117_S0000244	OKAY SO UP NEXT QUESTION MARA SAL IS HERE AND SHE IS ASKING
YOU1000000117_S0000245	I HAVE A COUPLE OF FAMILY MEMBERS THAT HAVE TESTED POSITIVE FOR COVID NINETEEN I FEEL LIKE MY MIND IS FOCUSED ONLY ON THAT SO HOW DO YOU SUPPOSE I GO ABOUT MY DAY WITH CARING FOR MY FAMILY BUT ALSO TAKING CARE OF MY OWN MENTAL HEALTH
YOU1000000117_S0000246	I THINK THIS IS AGAIN I'LL START BY DOING I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE WHICH IS TO VALIDATE THIS
YOU1000000117_S0000247	MANY OF US ARE GOING THROUGH THI SITUATION WHERE WE KNOW PEOPLE WHO ARE POSITIVE FOR COVID NINETEEN OR PRESUMED POSITIVE FOR COVID NINETEEN THINK A DIFFERENT SCARIER SITUATION NE CAN'T GET TESTED
YOU1000000117_S0000248	AND THAT'S INCREDIBLY SCARY AND SOMETIMES THAT COMES WITH THE ADDITIONALLY AWFUL THING THAT IF YOU'RE TRYING TO PHYSICALLY DISTANCE YOURSELF OR IF YOU'RE IN A VULNERABLE POSITION YOURSELF
YOU1000000117_S0000249	YOU MIGHT NOT EVEN BE ABLE TO TO TO HELP THEM IN THE NORMAL WAY BECAUSE YOU MIGHT NEED TO MAITAIN SOME DISTANCE FROM THEM
YOU1000000117_S0000250	AND SO I THINK THE FIRST THING TO DO WITH THIS IS TO HAVE SOME SELF COMPASSION THIS IS AN UNPRECEDENTEDLY BAD SITUATION
YOU1000000117_S0000251	AND YOU KIND OF JUST NEED TO BE NICE TO YOURSELF AND STOP FEELING GUILTY
YOU1000000117_S0000252	IF YOU'RE IN THE POSITION WHERE YOU WANT TO BE HELPING YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS AND ARE FEELING FRUSTRATED THAT YOU CAN'T INTERACT WITH THEM DIRECTLY
YOU1000000117_S0000253	IS FOR PEOPLE WHO FOR EXAMPLE HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE FAR AWAY OR FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE VULNERABLE THAT YOU CAN'T GET TO
YOU1000000117_S0000254	I THINK ONE THING THE RESEARCH SUGGESTS YOU CAN DO TO HELP WITH THAT IS TO ALLOW THOSE PRO SERCAL URGES TO COME OUT ANOTHER WAY ARE THERE OTHER ELDERLY FAMILY MEMBERS YOU CAN HELP
YOU1000000117_S0000255	OR SOMETHING ELSE YOU CAN DO THAT'S DOING GOOD IN THE WORLD EVEN IF YOU CAN'T DO GOOD FOR THAT ONE PERSON I THINK THAT CAN BE PARTICULARLY POWERFUL
YOU1000000117_S0000256	BUT IN TERMS OF JUST KIND OF GOING THROUGH THAT SITUATION WITH FAMILY MEMBERS I THINK PART OF IT IS TO FIND WAYS TO REDUCE YOUR OWN SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM ACTIVITY
YOU1000000117_S0000257	I THINK THE STRESS OF HAVING FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE SICK ON OUR OWN BODIES CAN BE INCREDIBLY ANXIETY PROVOKING
YOU1000000117_S0000258	AND I THINK YOU NEED TO JUST TAKE TIME TO KIND OF BREATHE AND AGAIN WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT BEFORE ABOUT KIND OF DOING THESE SLOWER BREATHS THESE BELLY BREATHS WE'RE TALKING A LOT ABOUT ON OUR PODCAST AND THINGS
YOU1000000117_S0000259	BUT THAT'S THE TIME TO DO THAT SORT OF DEEP BREATHING AND AGAIN THAT'S USEFUL
YOU1000000117_S0000260	BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO HELP YOUR OWN IMMUNE FUNCTION IT'S GOING TO SORT OF SHUT OFF THE FIGHTER FLIGHT SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM ACTIVITY
YOU1000000117_S0000261	AND ALLOW YOU TO TURN ON THIS PARASYMPATHETIC NERVOUS ACTIVITY WHICH IS WHAT WE NEED RIGHT NOW TO SORT OF REST AND DIGEST AND THAT WILL HELP YOUR IMMUNE FUNCTION
YOU1000000117_S0000262	BUT ITWILL ALSO GIVE YOU THE BANDWIDTH TO DEAL WITH THAT STRESSFUL SITUATION
YOU1000000117_S0000263	REMEMBER EVEN IF IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE IT THERE'S A LOT THAT YOU CAN DO TO EMBODY CALM YOURSELF IN ORDER TO HELP THE OTHER PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE
YOU1000000117_S0000264	AND SO VERY VERY HARD AND SCARY SITUATION COMPLETELY VALIDATING THAT
YOU1000000117_S0000265	BUT AGAIN KNOW THAT THERE'S SIMPLE ACTIONS YOU CAN TAKE TO KIND OF TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR OWN EMOTIONS AND SORT OF WORK WITH THEM EVEN IN THIS REALLY SCARY TIME
YOU1000000117_S0000267	FINAL QUESTION BECAUSE WE'RE AT TIME OUR FINAL QUESTION COMES FROM HOLLY
YOU1000000117_S0000268	WHO ASKS THAT HER QUESTION IS AROUND TRYING TO DO RANDOM ACTS OF KINDNESS AND MAKE SOCIAL CONNECTIONS DURING THIS TIME
YOU1000000117_S0000269	SHE HAS A FEW IDEAS IN MIND BUT IT'S HARD TO FIND WAYS IN EVERYDAY LIFE WHEN YOU'RE IN ISOLATION TO DO THIS MORE
YOU1000000117_S0000270	AGREE COMPLETELY YOU KNOW IN THE IN THE COURSE AND ON THE PODCAST WE TALK A LOT ABOUT THESE
YOU1000000117_S0000271	KIND OF RANDOM SOCIAL CONNECTIONS YOU KNOW THE CHATTING WITH THE BRISTA SOCIAL CONNECTIONS THAT HAPPEN REGULARLY YOU KNOW THIS IS THE STUFF THAT WE'RE MISSING MORE AND MORE NOW
YOU1000000117_S0000272	AND SO ONE OF THE TIPS I'VE BEEN GIVING IS TO TRY TO BUILD IN SOCIAL CONNECTION THAT'S NOT THE LIKE VERY FORMAL CONFERENCE CALL WITH THE FOLKS AT WORK BUT REALLY INFORMAL TYPE THINGS
YOU1000000117_S0000273	YOU KNOW LIKE I'M GON TA DO A YOGA CLASS JUST LIKE CALL YOU KNOW TEXT A FEW FRIENDS AND SAY HEY WHO WANTS TO JUMP IN WITH ME
YOU1000000117_S0000274	OR I'M GON TA HAVE A HALF HOUR WHERE I'M CHOPPING VEGETABLES AND TRYING TO DEAL WITH WHATEVER 'S IN MY PANTRY TO COOK TONIGHT
YOU1000000117_S0000275	LET ME SEE IF I COULD ZOOM A FRIEND WHO CAN JUMP IN WITH ME THEN
YOU1000000117_S0000276	I THINK THESE INFORMAL SOCIAL INTERACTIONS CAN BE INCREDIBLY POWERFUL
YOU1000000117_S0000277	WE HAVE TO INTENTIONALLY BUILD THEM IN IN A WAY THAT WE DIDN'T BEFORE THUT TWO THINGS THERE ONE IS THAT JUST TAKES A LITTLE BIT MORE WORK
YOU1000000117_S0000278	AND THE SECOND THING IS IF YOU FORM THE RIGHT HABIT NOW YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO IMPORT THAT LATER
YOU1000000117_S0000279	SO THAT WHEN THIS WHOLE CRISIS IS OVER YOU'RE DOING THOSE THINGS AS WELL
YOU1000000117_S0000280	IN TERMS OF THE THE RANDOM ACTS OF KINDNESS PART I THINK THERE 'RS SO MANY THINGS WE CAN BE DOING TO REACH OUT TO OTHERS
YOU1000000117_S0000281	ONE IS JUST TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS ACT OF SHELTERING IN PLACE STAYING HOME IS A PRO SOCIAL ACTION YOU ARE HELPING OTHER PEOPLE AND HELPING TO FLATTEN THE CURVE
YOU1000000117_S0000282	MAYBE SAVING THOUSANDS OF LIVES BY YOUR SIMPLE ACTION SO MAKE SURE YOU REFRAME IT THAT WAY
YOU1000000117_S0000283	BUT THE OTHER THING IS TO USE WHATEVER WINDFALLS YOU HAVE WHETHER THAT'S EXTRA TIME BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT WORKING AS MUCH
YOU1000000117_S0000284	OR LITTLE FINANCIAL WINDFALL YOU KNOW THOSE OF YOU WHO AREN'T PAYING GAS TO COMMUTE OR BUYING THAT COFFEE AT THE COFFEE SHOP REGULARLY THAT YOU NORMALLY BUY
YOU1000000117_S0000285	THOSE ARE LITTLE FINANCIAL WINDFALLS THAT YOU CAN USE TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE
YOU1000000117_S0000286	AND SO WHAT CAN YOU USE TO OROF USE THAT MONEY TO SAY HELP LOCAL BUSINESSES WHO NEED SOME HELP OR IF YOU JUST HAVE EXTRA TIME WHAT CAN YOU DO TO KIND OF CONTACT ELDERLY FAMILY MEMBERS WHO MIGHT NEED A CONNECTION RIGHT NOW
YOU1000000117_S0000287	OR EVEN TALK TO YOUR CONGRESS PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING LIKE THESE ARE THE TIMES WHEN WE CAN USE OUR TEMPORAL WINDFALLS OUR TIME WINDFALLS TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE A LOT
YOU1000000117_S0000288	OKAY I THINK THAT WAS A LOT I HOPE THAT YOU HEARD SOME FANTASTIC SUGGESTIONS
YOU1000000117_S0000289	I WANT YOU TO KEEP IN MIND TH THE MAN THING THAT I KEEPT MENTIONING WHICH IS SELF COMPASSION
YOU1000000117_S0000290	THIS IS A REALLY CHALLENGING TIME AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE NICE TO YOURSELF
YOU1000000117_S0000291	BUT ONE OF THE THINGS YOU CAN DO TO BE NICE TO YOURSELF IS TO REMEMBER WHAT SCIENCE SUGGESTS ABOUT THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT CAN IMPROVE YOUR WELL BEING
YOU1000000117_S0000292	WE KNOW THAT YOU'RE WASHING YOUR HANDS AND DOING GOOD STUFF FOR YOUR PHYSICAL HEALTH I HOPE THIS HAS GIVEN YOU A BUNCH OF TIPS FOR WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR YOUR MENTAL HEALTH TOO
YOU1000000117_S0000293	THERE'S SO MANY COMMENTS ON THERE SAND ING GRATITUDE MY WAY THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU ARE VERY WELCOME
YOU1000000117_S0000294	I HOPE THIS HAS GIVEN YOU SOME USEFUL TIPS AND I THANK YOU FOR SIGNING ON THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH
YOU1000000118_S0000001	WE START THE SPECIALIZATION WITH THIS COURSE
YOU1000000118_S0000002	HOW GOOGLE DOES ML WHERE I INTRODUCE MACHINE LEARNING AND WHAT GOOGLE MEANS WHEN WE SAY WE ARE AI FIRST
YOU1000000118_S0000003	MY COLLEAGUE JOSH THEN COMES IN TO TALK ABOUT THE STRATEGY OF MACHINE LEARNING
YOU1000000118_S0000004	WE END WITH A DISCUSSION OF TOOLING OF HOW TO DO MACHINE LEARNING AT SCALE USING PYTHON NOTEBOOKS AND SERVERLESS DATA PROCESSING COMPONENTS
YOU1000000118_S0000006	NOW IF YOU'RE AN ENGINEER OR A SCIENTIST YOU'RE PROBABLY THINKING THAT THIS IS ALL TOO HIGH LEVEL
YOU1000000118_S0000007	AND YOU'RE READY TO JUMP TO THE NEXT COURSE WHICH STARTS TO DELVE INTO TECHNICAL DETAILS OF TENSORFLOW BUT BEFORE YOU MAKE THAT DECISION LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING
YOU1000000118_S0000008	WHEN WE TAUGHT THIS SET OF COURSES TO OUR CUSTOMERS
YOU1000000118_S0000009	ONE REMARK THAT OFTEN CAME BACK WAS THAT THE MODULE BY JOSH WAS THE ONE THEY REVISITED THE MOST OFTEN
YOU1000000118_S0000011	AFTER THEY WENT BACK TO WORK SIX MONTHS LATER THE MODULE THAT THEY WENT TO TO LOOK AT THE MOST WAS ON THE STRATEGY OF MACHINE LEARNING
YOU1000000118_S0000012	SO YOU WANT TO GET THE BIG PICTURE BEFORE YOU DELVE INTO THE TECHNICAL DETAILS
YOU1000000118_S0000013	BECAUSE THE BIG PICTURE IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO GET BUY IN FROM THE REST OF THE ORGANIZATION TO CARRY OUT
YOU1000000118_S0000014	WE THEN MOVE ON TO DOING MACHINE LEARNING WITH TENSORFLOW THAT INVOLVES TWO ASPECTS
YOU1000000118_S0000015	ONE CREATING A GOOD MACHINE LEARNING DATASET AND TWO BUILDING YOUR FIRST MACHINE LEARNING MODEL WITH TENSORFLOW
YOU1000000118_S0000016	CREATING A MACHINE LEARNING DATASET IS ANOTHER OF THOSE PRACTICAL MODULES THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO IGNORE
YOU1000000118_S0000017	WHEN YOU CREATE A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL AND IT WORKS WELL IN YOUR EXPERIMENTS BUT THEN FAILS MISERABLY IN PRODUCTION
YOU1000000118_S0000018	THE REASON WILL OFTEN COME BACK TO HOW YOU CREATED THE MACHINE LEARNING DATASET SO GIVE YOURSELF TIME TO ABSORB THE LESSONS
YOU1000000118_S0000019	AND THEN WE HAVE TWO COURSES THAT ARE ABOUT IMPROVING MACHINE LEARNING ACCURACY
YOU1000000118_S0000020	AS YOU BUILD YOUR FIRST MACHINE LEARNING MODEL YOU WILL LEARN THAT THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS YOU CAN DO TO IMPROVE THAT MODEL
YOU1000000118_S0000021	SO THINK OF THIS SECTION AS FILLING YOUR TOOL CHEST WITH A SET OF IDEAS
YOU1000000118_S0000022	YOU'LL USE DIFFERENT IDEAS IN DIFFERENT SITUATIONS SO YOU'LL FIND THAT KNOWING THEM WILL BE HELPFUL IN YOUR CAREER AS YOU SOLVE DIFFERENT MACHINE LEARNING PROBLEMS
YOU1000000118_S0000023	AND AS BEFORE IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO JUST NAME CHECK THESE CONCEPTS YOU NEED TO GIVE YOURSELF TIME TO UNDERSTAND THEM
YOU1000000118_S0000024	AND KNOW HOW TO IMPLEMENT THEM IN CODE WE THEN MOVE ON TO A SET OF COURSES THAT ARE ABOUT OPERATIONALIZING THE MACHINE LEARNING MODEL
YOU1000000118_S0000025	AS I MENTIONED EARLIER OPERATIONALIZING A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL
YOU1000000118_S0000026	AND BY THAT I MEAN TRAINING IT AT SCALE IN A DISTRIBUTED WAY SERVING OUT THE PREDICTIONS
YOU1000000118_S0000027	BUILDING A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL END TO END OPERATIONALIZING A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL CAN BE SUPER HARD
YOU1000000118_S0000028	IT IS A STAGE WHERE MOST ENTERPRISE MACHINE LEARNING PROJECTS FAIL
YOU1000000118_S0000029	I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MANY COMPANIES I'VE TALKED TO WHO HAVE SAID THEIR INNOVATION TEAMS HAD DEVISED THESE COOL ML PROJECTS BUT THEY WERE STRUGGLING GETTING THE ML MODELS INTO PRODUCTION
YOU1000000118_S0000030	IN THIS SET OF COURSES WE WILL TALK ABOUT HOW TO TRAIN DEPLOY AND PREDICT WITH ML MODELS IN A WAY THAT THEY'RE PRODUCTION READY
YOU1000000118_S0000031	AND FINALLY WE DELVE BACK INTO MACHINE LEARNING THEORY BUT THEORY IN BIG AIRCODES
YOU1000000118_S0000032	MACHINE LEARNING THEORY IS MOSTLY HERISTICS MACHINE LEARNING IS AN INTENSELY HEURISTIC DISCIPLINE
YOU1000000118_S0000033	AND YOU'RE ONLY AS GOOD AS YOUR BAG OF TOOLS AND TRICKS
YOU1000000118_S0000034	SO WE'LL INTRODUCE A NUMBER OF TOOLS AND TRICKS THAT WORK WHEN THE INPUTS TO YOUR MACHINE LEARNING MODELS ARE IMAGES
YOU1000000118_S0000036	TOOLS AND TRICKS THAT HELP IN YOUR PROCESSING OR OUTPUTTING SEQUENCES
YOU1000000118_S0000037	AND SEQUENCES IN MACHINE LEARNING CAN BE EITHER TIME SERIES DATA OR TEX DATA
YOU1000000118_S0000038	AND FINALLY WE WILL LOOK AT SEVERAL WAYS TO BUILD POWERFUL RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS
YOU1000000118_S0000039	RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS ARE HOW YOU BUILD PERSONALIZED ALGORITHMS
YOU1000000118_S0000040	AND SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT MOST MML ENGINEERS BUILD AT SOME POINT IN THEIR CAREERS
YOU1000000118_S0000041	IN FACT IT MIGHT BE THE ONLY ML SYSTEM THAT MANY PEOPLE WILL BUILD
YOU1000000118_S0000042	BUT IN ORDER TO BUILD POWERFUL RECOMMENDATION ENGINES IT TURNS OUT THAT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND TOOLS AND TRICKS
YOU1000000118_S0000043	THAT ARE BORROWED FROM IMAGES AND FROM SEQUENCES
YOU1000000118_S0000044	SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE LOOKING AT THEM IN THIS ORDER AND THAT'S WHY WE LOOK AT RECOMMENDATION ENGINES PRETTY MUCH AT THE END OF THE SPECIALIATION
YOU1000000118_S0000045	NOW YOU MAY HAVE ENCOUNTERED SOME OF THIS MATERIAL BEFORE ESPECIALLY IN THE FIRST FOUR COURSES
YOU1000000118_S0000046	FOR EXAMPLE IN THE COURSES ON CREATING MACHINE LEARNING DATASETS
YOU1000000118_S0000047	AND ON TENSERFLOW BASICS SOME OF THE SLIDES WILL BE A REPEAT OF SERVERLESS MACHINE LEARNING WITH TENSERFLOW THAT'S AVAILABLE IN CORSERA
YOU1000000118_S0000048	SIMILARLY IF YOU ENCOUNTERED GOOGLE'S MACHINE LEARNING CRASH COURSE THIS IS AN INTERNAL GOOGLE COURSE BUT IT HAS ALSO BEEN TAUGHT ON SOME UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES
YOU1000000118_S0000049	YOU MIGHT FIND SOME OF THE MATERIAL IN FEATURE REPRESENTATION AND ART AND SIGNS OF ML TO BE FAMILIAR
YOU1000000118_S0000051	IN SPITE OF THIS THOUGH THE DETAILS ARE QUITE DIFFERENT SO DON'T SKIP IT COMPLETELY
YOU1000000118_S0000052	TREAT THESE COURSES AS A USEFUL REFRESHER AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU STILL REMEMBER THE IDEAS PRESENTED IN THOSE SECTIONS
YOU1000000119_S0000001	WELCOME TO THE FIRST COURSE IN THE BLOCKCHAIN SPECIALIZATION TITLED BLOCKCHAIN BASICS
YOU1000000119_S0000002	LET'S START BY ASKING OURSELVES WHAT IS A BLOCKCHAIN WHY SHOULD YOU CARE ABOUT IT
YOU1000000119_S0000003	UNLIKE TRADITIONAL METHODS BLOCKCHAIN ENABLES PEER TO PEER TRANSFER OF DIGITAL ASSETS WITHOUT ANY INTERMEDIARIES
YOU1000000119_S0000004	IT WAS A TECHNOLOGY ORIGINALLY CREATED TO SUPPORT THE FAMOUS CRYPTOCURRENCY BITCOIN
YOU1000000119_S0000005	THE BLOCKCHAIN BY ITSELF HAS TAKEN A LIFE OF ITS OWN AND PERMEATED A BROAD RANGE OF APPLICATIONS ACROSS MANY INDUSTRIES INCLUDING FINANCE HEALTH CARE GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION
YOU1000000119_S0000006	THE BLOCKCHAIN IS POISED TO INNOVATE AND TRANSFORM A WIDE RANGE OF APPLICATIONS INCLUDING GOODS TRANSFER FOR EXAMPLE SUPPLY CHAIN DIGITAL MEDIA TRANSFER FOR EXAMPLE SALE OF ART

YOU1000000119_S0000011	AND GOVERNMENT PUBLIC RECORDS AND OPEN GOVERNNG
YOU1000000119_S0000013	MOREOVER BLOCKCHAIN CAN ENABLE AN INCLUSIVE ECONOMY IT CAN ENABLE A PERSON IN A REMOTE CORNER OF THE WORLD TO PARTAKE IN A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS
YOU1000000119_S0000014	OPPORTUNITIES FOR INNOVATIVE APPLICATIONS ARE ENDLESS
YOU1000000119_S0000015	THERE IS A DIRE NEED FOR CRITICAL THINKERS DESIGNERS AND DEVELOPERS WHO CAN ENVISION AND CREATE NEWER APPLICATION MODELS ON BLOCKCHAIN TO BENEFIT THE WORLD
YOU1000000119_S0000016	THIS COURSE IS A FIRST STEP IN ADDRESSING THIS NEED
YOU1000000119_S0000017	AT THE END OF THIS COURSE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN THE THREE FUNDAMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS THAT DEFINE THE BLOCKCHAIN USING BITCOIN BLOCKCHAIN
YOU1000000119_S0000018	BITCOIN IS NOW THE ONLY PLAYER IN TOWN BY THE END OF THE FIRST MODULE WE'L MOVE BEYOND BITCOIN INTO INTRODUCING THE NEXT GENERATION BLOCKCHAINS WITH ETHERE
YOU1000000119_S0000020	YOU WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO DISCUSS THE IMPORTANT FEATURES OF ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN THAT IS USED AS A REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION IN MANY NEWER BLOCKCHAINS
YOU1000000119_S0000021	AND EXPLAIN THE ALGORITHMS AND TECHNIQUES THAT ENABLE THE BLOCKCHAIN INCLUDING A PUBLIKE CRYPTOGRAPHY AND HASHING
YOU1000000119_S0000022	FINALLY YOU WILL BE ABLE TO OUTLINE METHODS FOR REALIZING TRUST IN A BLOCKCHAIN
YOU1000000119_S0000024	LET'S BEGIN WITH AN INTRODUCTION OF BITCOIN
YOU1000000119_S0000025	TWO MAJOR CONTRIBUTIONS OF CRYPTOCURRENCY BITCOIN ARE A CONTINUOUSLY WORKING DIGITAL CURRENCY SYSTEM AND A MODEL FOR AUTONOMOUS DECENTRALIZED APPLICATION TECHNOLOGY CALLED THE BLOCKCHAG
YOU1000000119_S0000027	THOUGH OUR FOCUS IS ON A GENERAL BLOCKCHAIN WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE WORKING OF THE TECHNOLOGY BEHIND BITCOIN TO FULLY APPRECIATE THE INNOVATION OF BLOCKCHA
YOU1000000119_S0000029	WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THE ADVENT OF THE INTERNET AND THE WORLDWIDE WEB HAS TRANSFORMED EVERY ASPECT OF OUR LIVES FROM STOCK MARKETS TO STREET CORNER FOOD TRUCKS
YOU1000000119_S0000030	IT HAS ENABLED THE TECHNOLOGY EXPLOSION WITH WEB TWO POINT O AND THE WORLD OF ECOMMERCE APPLICATIONS
YOU1000000119_S0000031	AROUND TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TWO THOUSAND NINE WHEN THE INSTITUTIONS AND MARKETS WE TRUSTED WERE CRUMBLING DOWN AND EVERYBODY WAS RUNNING AWAY FROM THE WALL STREET
YOU1000000119_S0000032	A MYSTERIOUS PERSON OR PERSONS CALLED SATHOSHI NACOMOTO INTRODUCED A NEW DIGITAL CURRENCY A CRYPTOCURRENCY CALLED BITCO IN
YOU1000000119_S0000034	BITCOIN ENABLED AN INNOVATIVE PLATFORM FOR PEER TO PEER TRANSFER OF VALUE WITHOUT ANY CENTRAL AUTHORIT
YOU1000000119_S0000036	WITH NO CENTRAL AUTHORITY HOW DID BITCOIN REALIZE TRUST AND SECURITY
YOU1000000119_S0000037	BY IMPLEMENTING SOFTWARE PROGRAMS FOR VALIDATION VERIFICATION CONCSENSES IN A NORVAL INFRASTRUCTURE CALLED THE BO
YOU1000000119_S0000039	LATER ON IN ABOUT TWENTY TWELVE TWENTY THIRTEEN COMPUTATIONAL ELEMENTS WERE ADDED TO THE BLOCKCHAIN INFRASTRUCTURE
YOU1000000119_S0000040	THAT HAS OPENED UP A WHOLE WORLD OF POSSIBILITIES BEYOND SIMPLE CURRENCY TRANSFER
YOU1000000119_S0000041	THESE INNOVATIONS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY SHAPING THE DIRECTION OF WEB THREE POINT O AS YOU WILL LEARN IN THE NEXT FOUR COURSE
YOU1000000119_S0000043	WHAT IS A BLOCKCHAIN BLOCKCHAIN IS ABOUT ENABLING PEER TO PEER TRANSACTION IN A DECENTRALIZED NETWORK
YOU1000000119_S0000044	ESTABLISHING TRUST AMONG UNKNOWN PEERS
YOU1000000119_S0000045	RECORDING THE TRANSACTION IN AN IMMUTABLE DISTRIBUTED LEDGER
YOU1000000119_S0000047	LET'S UNDERSTAND CENTRALIZED VERSUS DECENTRALIZED NETWORK USING A COMMON SENARIO
YOU1000000119_S0000048	CONSIDER A SCENARIO WHERE A CUSTOMER WANTS TO BUY AN ITEM USING HER CREDIT CARD
YOU1000000119_S0000050	LET'S ENUMERATE THE INTERMEDIARIES INVOLVED IN ACCOMPLISHING THIS TASK
YOU1000000119_S0000051	WE HAVE A CREDIT CARD AGENCY WE HAVE A CUSTOMER BANK WE HAVE A CREDIT CARDS BANK WE HAVE AN EXCHANGE WE HAVE THE MERCHANT'S BANK AND FINALLY THE MERCHANT
YOU1000000119_S0000053	THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A CENTRALIZED SYSTEM THAT WE ARE SO USED TO
YOU1000000119_S0000054	NOW COMPARE THIS WITH A SYSTEM WHERE PEERS CAN TRANSACT DIRECTLY WITH EACH OTHER IRRESPECTIVE OF WHERE THEY ARE LOCATED
YOU1000000119_S0000056	FUNCTIONS OF THE INTERMEDIARIES ARE SHIFTED TO THE PERIPHERY TO THE PEER PARTICIPANT IN THE BLOCKCHAIN INFRASTRUCTURE
YOU1000000119_S0000057	PRS ARE NOT NECESSARILY KNOWN TO EACH OTHER THIS IS A DECENTRALIZED SYSTEM
YOU1000000119_S0000058	HOW DO WE ESTABLISH TRUST AMONG THE PEERS IN SUCH A DECENTRALIZED SYSTEM
YOU1000000119_S0000059	BY HAVING A PROCESS IN PLACE TO VALIDATE VERIFY AND CONFIRM TRANSACTIONS
YOU1000000119_S0000060	RECORD THE TRANSACTION IN A DISTRIBUTED LEDGER OF BLOCKS
YOU1000000119_S0000061	CREATE A TAMPER PROOF RECORD OFBLOCKS CHAIN O BLOCKS
YOU1000000119_S0000063	AND IMPLEMENT A CONSENSUS PROTOCOL FOR AGREEMENT ON THE BLOCK TO BE ADDED TO THE CHAIN
YOU1000000119_S0000064	SO VALIDATION VERIFICATION CONSENSUS AND IMMUTABLE RECORDING LEAD TO THE TRUST AND SECURITY OF THE BLOCKCHAIN
YOU1000000119_S0000066	NOW I'LL EXPLAIN THESE CONCEPTS USING ANOTHER SCENARIO
YOU1000000119_S0000068	I'M LENDING AMY TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS THIS IS ONE SINGLE PEER TO PEER TRANSACTION
YOU1000000119_S0000069	WE BOTH MAKE A NOTE OF IT ON A LEDGER
YOU1000000119_S0000070	WHAT IF I CHANGED MY ENTRY FROM TEN THOUSAND TO ELEVEN THOUSAND
YOU1000000119_S0000071	ALTERNATIVELY AMY CHANGES HERS FROM TEN THOUSAND TO ONE THOUSAND
YOU1000000119_S0000072	TO PREVENT THIS TRUST VIOLATION WE NEED TO SEEK THE HELP OF PEOPLE AROUND US LISA ALISON AND FRANCIS
YOU1000000119_S0000073	PROVIDE ALL OF THEM A VALID COPY OF THIS LEDGER
YOU1000000119_S0000074	THIS IS THE BASIC CONCEPT OF AN IMMUTABLE DISTRIBUTED LEDGER DEFINED IN A BLOCKCHAIN PROCESS
YOU1000000119_S0000076	IN THIS SCENARIO WE WERE ALL PHYSICALLY PRESENT IN ONE LOCATION AMMERSTD
YOU1000000119_S0000077	NOW IMAGINE THIS TO BE AN ONLINE TRANSACTION
YOU1000000119_S0000078	TO AN UNKNOWN PEER ALSO SCALE UP THE ONE TRANSACTION TO TEN THOUSAND TRANSACTIONS HOW ABOUT A MILLION TRANSACTIONS
YOU1000000119_S0000079	I SHOULD BE ABLE TO TRANSACT WITH EQUAL EASE TO ANY UNKNOWN PEER IN AMHERST ALBANY OR ALBANIA
YOU1000000119_S0000080	MAYBE TO SEND SOME FLOWERS TO A FRIEND IN ALBANIA THIS IS THE TENET OF A DECENTRALIZED SYSTEM SUPPORTED BY BLOCKCHAIN
YOU1000000119_S0000082	IN THE CASE JUST DESCRIBED HOW DO WE TRUST OUR UNKNOWN PEERS
YOU1000000119_S0000083	THROUGH VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION IN HER EXAMPLE AMY REQUESTS KEVIN TO VERIFY THE AMOUNT I TRANSACTED WITH R
YOU1000000119_S0000085	KEVIN CHECKS IT OPS KEVIN FINDS THE AMOUNT OF TRANSACTION IS NOT TEN THOUSAND BUT THREE HUNDRED NOT VALID
YOU1000000119_S0000086	KEVIN REJECTS AND NULLIFIES THE TRANSACTION SIMILAR TO THIS VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION METHODS DEVINED BY THE BLOCKCHAIN
YOU1000000119_S0000087	AND IMPLEMENTED BY THE PEERS PROVIDE THE COLLECTIVE TRUST NEEDED IN A DECENTRALIZED SYSTEM
YOU1000000119_S0000088	SUMMARIZING BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY SUPPORTS METHODS FOR A DECENTRALIZED PEER TO PEER SYSTEM A COLLECTIVE TRUST MODEL
YOU1000000119_S0000089	AND THE DISTRIBUTED IMMUTABLE LEDGER OF RECORDS OF TRANSACTIONS
YOU1000000120_S0000001	I'M BA

YOU1000000121_S0000035	SO FROM THE BACK STEPPING BACK ON THE RIGHT LEG BENDING THE RIGHT ARM
YOU1000000121_S0000036	WHEN I STEP BACK ON THE LEFT LEG I BEND MY LEFT ARM
YOU1000000121_S0000037	RIGHT LEG RIGHT ARM LEFT LEG LEFT ARM
YOU1000000121_S0000038	SO LET'S TRY THIS FROM THE FRONT BACK ON THE RIGHT LEG BENDING THE RIGHT ARM BACK ON THE LEFT LEG BENDING THE LEFT ARM

YOU1000000121_S0000081	RIGHT ARM LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT AND LT
YOU1000000122_S0000001	TAKE A LOOK AT THESE TWO PHOTOS OF OUTER SPACE WHAT DO YOU SEE THEY'RE BASICALLY IDENTICAL BUT NOT QUITE NOW LOOK A DIFFERENT WAY IN SEQUENCE
YOU1000000122_S0000002	HERE YOU SEE SOMETHING DIFFERENT SOMETHING MOVING THAT DOT IS A NEWLY DISCOVERED WORLD IT'S CLOSER THAN WE EVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE
YOU1000000122_S0000003	AND THE TRICK WE USE TO FIND IT COULD REWRITE THE STORY OF OUR COSMIC NEIGHBORHOOD
YOU1000000122_S0000005	TODAY SCIENTISTS HAVE OUR SOLAR SYSTEM PRETTY WELL MAPPED OUT WE KNOW ABOUT THE EIGHT PLANETS PLUTO MOONS ASTEROIDS COMETS
YOU1000000122_S0000006	AND UNTIL RECENTLY WE THOUGHT WE HAD A HANDLE ON OUR SOLAR NEIGHBORHOOD TOO
YOU1000000122_S0000008	THERE'S THE ALPHACNTORI SYSTEM ABOUT FOUR LIGHT YEARS AWAY AND BARNARD STAR A RED DWARF A LITTLE FARTHER OUT
YOU1000000122_S0000009	ASTRONOMERS MADE THESE DISCOVERIES MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO
YOU1000000122_S0000010	BUT TODAY SOME NEW WORK IS TOTALLY UPENDING OUR VIEW OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD IT INVOLVES A SPACE TELESCOPE AN ARMY OF VOLUNTEERS AND A SCIENTIST ON A VERY SPECIFIC MISSION
YOU1000000122_S0000011	MY NAME IS JACKIE FAREDY AND I'M AN ASTROPHYSICIST AT THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY
YOU1000000122_S0000012	JACQUIE HAS SPENT FIFTEEN YEARS SEARCHING OUR SOLAR NEIGHBORHOOD FOR NEW NEIGHBORS
YOU1000000122_S0000013	SHE'S FOCUSED ON MYSTERIOUS WORLDS KNOWN AS BROWN DWARFES BALLS OF GAS THAT ARE TOO BIG TO BE PLANETS BUT TOO SMALL TO BE STARS
YOU1000000122_S0000014	NOW THEY'RE THEY'RE OFTEN CALLED FAILED STARS BUT I REALLY DISLIKE THE WORD FAILURE IN THE TITLE
YOU1000000122_S0000015	BECAUSE I JUST FEEL LIKE IT'S KIND OF DEMEANING TO THE BROWN DWARF
YOU1000000122_S0000016	LIKE IT NEEDS TO BE A STAR IT DOESN'T CARE AND SO OFTENTIMES I CALL THEM OVEREXCITED PLANETS
YOU1000000122_S0000017	BROWN DWARFS WOULD BE STARS IF THEY WERE MORE MASSIVE BUT WITHOUT ENOUGH HYDROGEN THEY DON'T ACHIEVE NUCLEAR FUSION
YOU1000000122_S0000018	THEY EMIT LOTS OF INFARED ENERGY BUT VERY LITTLE VISIBLE LIGHT
YOU1000000122_S0000019	SO FOR A LONG TIME THEY WERE HIDDEN TO ASTRONOMERS BUT THAT ALL CHANGED IN THE NINETY S
YOU1000000122_S0000020	INFORED TECHNOLOGY AND INFARED TELESCOPES STARTED TO COME ONLINE IN EARNEST AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS YOU START TO SEE THESE SKY SURVEYS
YOU1000000122_S0000021	THAT ARE ABLE TO PRODUCE THE WAVE LNGTHS WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THE BROWN DWORFS
YOU1000000122_S0000022	THE FIRST BROWN DWARFS WERE IDED AROUND NINETEN NINETY FIVE AND SINCE THEN THE FIELD HAS EXPLODED
YOU1000000122_S0000023	TODAY THE ASTRONOMY COMMUNITY IS A WASH IN IMAGERY THAT COULD HARBOR NEARBY BROWN DWARFS
YOU1000000122_S0000024	ACTUALLY FINDING THEM IS ANOTHER STORY BUT THERE'S AN OLD TECHNIQUE CALLED THE BLINK METHOD THAT WORKS WONDERS
YOU1000000122_S0000025	THE BASIC IDEA IS THAT ALL STARS ARE IN MOTION RELATIVE TO US MOST ARE SO FAR AWAY THAT THEY MOVE IMPERCEPTIBLY
YOU1000000122_S0000026	BUT OBJECTS IN OUR SOLAR NEIGHBORHOOD THOSE ARE CLOSE ENOUGH THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY CATCH THEIR MOVEMENT IF WE'RE PATIENT ENOUGH
YOU1000000122_S0000027	HERE ARE FOUR IMAGES TAKEN WITH VARIOUS TELESCOPES OVER A SPAN OF THIRTY TWO YEARS
YOU1000000122_S0000028	IF YOU FLIP OR BLINK THROUGH THEM YOU SEE THAT NOT EVERYTHING IS STAYING PUT
YOU1000000122_S0000029	OBJECTS OF INTEREST THAT ARE IN THE NEARBY VICINITY THEY WILL MOVE THEY WILL JUMP AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF STARS
YOU1000000122_S0000030	THAT IS LUMIN SIXTEEN A PAIR OF BROWN DWARFS THAT'S ONLY SIX AND A HALF LIGHT YEARS FROM EARTH IT WAS DISCOVERED USING THE BLINK METHOD IN TWENTY THIRTEEN
YOU1000000122_S0000031	AND IT'S NOW THE THIRD CLOSEST KNOWN SYSTEM TO OURS
YOU1000000122_S0000032	WE HAD NOT CHANGED THAT LIST OF OBJECTS IN THE TOP FIVE IN A CENTURY IT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN
YOU1000000122_S0000033	WE SHOULD NOT BE FINDING OBJECTS ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT ARE SPITTING DISTANCE AWAY FROM US THAT WE'VE BEEN MISSING ALL THIS TIME
YOU1000000122_S0000034	THE BLINK METHOD ISN'T NEW CLIDE TOMBAH USED IT TO DISCOVER PLUTO BACK IN NINETEEN THIRTY AND IT'S BEEN USED TO DISCOVER MOONS ASTEROIDS AND DWARF PLANETS
YOU1000000122_S0000035	BUT PAIRED WITH NEW INFRRED IMAGERY IT'S SLOWLY BRINGING OUR NEIGHBORHOOD INTO FOCUS A LITTLE TOO SLOWLY REALLY
YOU1000000122_S0000036	A FEW YEARS BACK JACQUIE FOUND HERSELF STARING DOWN MILLIONS OF IMAGES THAT COULD CONTAIN NEW DISCOVERIES IT WAS DAUNTING
YOU1000000122_S0000037	I AM SPENDING HOURS OF MY TIME EVERY WEEK BLINKING IMAGES IN LIKE MY SPARE TIME
YOU1000000122_S0000038	AND I CAN'T IT'S JUST AS FRUSTRATING IS TAKING TOO MUCH TIME AND I'LL NEVER GET THROUGH ALL OF IT
YOU1000000122_S0000039	THE IMAGES ARE NOISY AND BLURRY AND EACH ONE NEEDED REAL ATTENTION IT WAS FAR TOO MUCH FOR ANY TEAM TO HANDLE
YOU1000000122_S0000041	UNLESS THAT TEAM WERE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
YOU1000000122_S0000042	AND SO THUS SPRUNG OUR CITIZEN SCIENCE PROJECT
YOU1000000122_S0000043	AT THE BEGINNING MY GIRLFRIEND DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY I WAS LOOKING FOR A JUST BUNCH OF MOVING PIXELS DING FOR HOURS
YOU1000000122_S0000044	STARTING IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN JACQUIE AND HER TEAM INVITED THE ENTIRE INTERNET TO GO HUNTING FOR BROWN DWARFS
YOU1000000122_S0000045	THEIR SYSTEM IS DEAD SIMPLE USERS LOG INTO A WEBSITE AND MEET THEIR FIRST ASTRONOMY FLIPBOOK
YOU1000000122_S0000046	THE IMAGES COME IN A SEQUENCE OF FOUR AND IT WILL FLIP THOSE IMAGES FLIP THROUGH TIME SO IT SHOWS YOU WHAT THIS POINT IN SPACE LOOKED LIKE
YOU1000000122_S0000047	IN THIS YEAR AND THEN A LITTLE BIT AFTER AND THEN A LITTLE AFTER AND THEN A LITTLE AFTER
YOU1000000122_S0000048	YOU'LL KIND OF SEE BLUE AND ORANGE DOTS TYPICALLY THAT ARE EVERYWHERE
YOU1000000122_S0000049	IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE STARING AT COLORFUL TELEVISION STATIC
YOU1000000122_S0000050	CAN BE KIND OF ANNOYING AT FIRST IF YOU DON'T QUITE KNOW WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
YOU1000000122_S0000051	BUT IF YOU'RE LUCKY YOU'LL CATCH A MOVER
YOU1000000122_S0000052	WHEN YOU FINALLY FIND SOMETHING MOVING IT'S A BIT OF A ADRENALINE RUSH
YOU1000000122_S0000053	FASTER MOVING OBJECTS ACTUALLY DO BLINK ACROSS THE SCREEN SLOWER ONES MIGHT JUST TWINKLE
YOU1000000122_S0000054	THEYE 'RE BASICALLY THESE LITTLE TINY LIKE WHITE DOTS THAT WILL FLASH WHEN YOU PLAY OUR FLIP BOOKS
YOU1000000122_S0000055	EITHER WAY YOU CAN MARK YOUR ANOMALY AND ALERT THE COMMUNITY
YOU1000000122_S0000057	I THINK I FOUND SOMETHING AND EVERYONE ELSE KIND OF IS LIKE YEAH YEAH THAT'S ONE IT'S LIKE ODT YES I'M GOOD I FOUND SOMETHING
YOU1000000122_S0000058	THE MOST PROMISING LEADS END UP ON JACQUIE'S RADAR HER TEAM CAN THEN BOOK TELESCOPE TIME TO LOOK MORE CLOSELY FOR YOU CITIZEN SCIENTIST IT'S BACK TO BLINKING
YOU1000000122_S0000059	IT'S LIKE IN A WORD IT'S LIKE A TREASURE HUNT IN YOUR COUCH IT'S REALLY SOMETHING THAT KEEPS YOU HOOKED
YOU1000000122_S0000060	SINCE BACKYARD WORLDS LAUNCHED VOLUNTEERS HAVE BEEN ON A TEAIR
YOU1000000122_S0000061	THEY'VE DISCOVERED HUNDREDS HUNDREDS OF NEARBY OBJECTS
YOU1000000122_S0000062	SOME WERE A NOVEL KIND OF COMPACT FROZEN WORLD
YOU1000000122_S0000063	PRIOR TO BACKYARD WORLDS THERE WAS ONLY TWENTY FOUR OF THEM KNOWN THEY ADDED FIVE NEW ONES
YOU1000000122_S0000064	OTHERS HAD SURPRISING NEW ATMOSPHERES
YOU1000000122_S0000065	REALLY STRANGE LOOKING OBJECTS
YOU1000000122_S0000066	AND STILL OTHERS WERE HIDDEN SIBLINGS OF KNOWN OBJECTS
YOU1000000122_S0000067	I HAD CERTAINLY STUDIED THE BROWN DWARPF IN THE SYSTEM A LOT IN PREVIOUS WORK AND NEVER DID I GUESS THAT IT HAD A LITTLE COLD COMPANION WITH IT
YOU1000000122_S0000068	ALL IN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF USERS HAVE FOUND MORE THAN FIFTEEN HUNDRED NEW OBJECTS
YOU1000000122_S0000069	VOLUNTEERS LIKE DAN AND GIOM HAVE GOTTEN CREDITS IN ACADEMIC PAPERS FOR THEIR DISCOVERIES
YOU1000000122_S0000070	THERERE STILL MORE TO FIND JACQUI THINKS THE EFFORT COULD REVEAL A BROWN DWARF EVEN CLOSER THAN ALPHA SENTORI
YOU1000000122_S0000071	A NEW NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR THERE'S EVEN A CHANCE WE COULD FIND THE BIG FOOT OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM PLANET NINE
YOU1000000122_S0000072	THERE IS AN OBJECT THAT'S THEORIZED TO EXIST BEYOND PLUTO THAT IS MASSIVE THAT IT COULD BE CAUSING SOME OBJECTS IN THE OUTER SOLAR SYSTEM TO BE BUMPED AROUND A BIT
YOU1000000122_S0000073	AND IT'S IT'S AN EXCITING PROSPECT NOW DOES IT EXIST I DON'T KNOW I'M HAPPY THAT WE HAVE CITIZENS THAT ARE VERY INTERESTED IN TRYING TO FIND IT
YOU1000000122_S0000074	IF IT'S REAL IF IT'S THERE AND MAYBE IT IS
YOU1000000122_S0000076	AS SUCCESSFUL AS THE BLINK METHOD IS IT HAS COMPETITION ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE HAS BEEN HUGE FOR ASTRONOMERS WHO NEED TO SIFT THROUGH TONS OF IMAGERY INCLUDING JACKUIE
YOU1000000122_S0000077	THE HUMAN EYE IS BEAUTIFUL AT PICKING OUT THINGS
YOU1000000122_S0000078	IT'S JUST SLOW BECAUSE WE HAVE TO GO IMAGE BY IMAGE AND SO HUMAN EYE WINS SOME AND IN SOME WAYS BUT AI WINS IN SPEED SO I USE BOTH
YOU1000000122_S0000079	ONE LIMITATION OF AI IS THAT IT NEEDS TO TRAIN USING EXAMPLES OF THINGS THAT IT'S LOOKING FOR SO IF THAT THING IS BRAND NEW HUMAN BRAINS HAVE THE EDGE
YOU1000000122_S0000080	YOU ARE THE TRAINED ALGORITHM AT THAT POINT
YOU1000000122_S0000081	THAT SAID ASTRONOMY IS FACING A TOTAL WAVE OF DATA
YOU1000000122_S0000082	IN A COUPLE YEARS ASTRONOMERS WILL BEGIN IMAGING THE ENTIRE NIGHT SKY OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE TWICE A WEEK
YOU1000000122_S0000083	THERE IS NO WAY WE ARE LOOKING THROUGH ALL OF THE DATA IN THE CLASSIC WAYS IN THE COMING FUTURE LIKE IT'S OVER
YOU1000000122_S0000084	FOR NOW JACQUIE WILL TAKE ALL THE HELP SHE CAN GET FROM HUMAN VOLUNTEERS TO ALGORITHMS THE HUMANS ARE MORE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT IT
YOU1000000122_S0000085	NO YOU SPEND COUNTLESS HOURS POURING THROUGH IMAGES AND DESIGNING CUSTOM ALGORITHMS AND SERVICES AND YOU GET SOMETHING GREAT
YOU1000000122_S0000086	IT'S SUPER EXCITING TO SEE THAT ALL OF THIS WORK THAT WE PUT IN HAS AN IMPACT
YOU1000000122_S0000087	YOU CAN SAY TO YOURSELF YEAH IT'S IT'S SOMETHING I SAW
YOU1000000122_S0000088	AND I'M THE FIRST HUMAN BEING TO IN THE OLL HISTORY OF MANKIND TO TO SEE IT THAT'S A IT'S A GREAT FEELING
YOU1000000122_S0000090	THANK YOU TO LEXUS FOR THEIR SUPPORT BE SURE TO CHECK OUT THE NEW LEXIS IS BY GOING TO LEXUS DOT COM SLASH IS
YOU1000000122_S0000091	THEIR CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT GOING ALL IN ON YOUR PASSION AND GETTING A GREATER REWARD WHICH IS WHY THEY SPONSORED THIS SERIES ON RESEARCHERS AND INNOVATORS
YOU1000000122_S0000092	THEY DON'T INFLUENCE OUR EDITORIAL BUT THEY DO HELP MAKE VIDEOS LIKE THIS VIABLE SO THANKS AGAIN TO THEM AND THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
YOU1000000123_S0000000	SO WHAT SHALL I HOW SHALL I BEGIN THIS IS THE VLERB FOR THE COURSE
YOU1000000123_S0000001	VERB THAT'S BEEN IN THE YALE CATALOG FOR A LONG TIME THIS IS A COURSE ON FINANCE
YOU1000000123_S0000002	IT HAS THE WORD MARKETS IN THE NAME WHICH SUGGESTS THAT IT'S ABOUT TRADING
YOU1000000123_S0000004	
YOU1000000123_S0000006	BUT I THINK IT'S A BROAD COURSE IN FFINANCE
YOU1000000123_S0000007	SO THE BLURB SAYS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE A PILLAR OF CIVILIZED SOCIETY
YOU1000000123_S0000008	IRECTING RESOURCES ACROSS SPACE AND TIME TO THEIR BEST USES SO THIS SOUNDS BROADER I GUESS THE COURSE IS BROADER
YOU1000000123_S0000009	I WROTE THE TITLE OF THE COURSE MANY YEARS AGO WHEN I CREATED THIS COURSE
YOU1000000123_S0000010	AND IT'S BEEN A TITLE FOR IT BUT
YOU1000000123_S0000012	SEE WHAT REALLY TO ME THIS COURSE IS ABOUT IS HOW WE GET THINGS DONE IN OUR SOCIETY
YOU1000000123_S0000013	THAT'S HOW WE INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO DO THINGS NOW MOST OF US ARE IN OUR LIVES THINKING ABOUT OURSELVES
YOU1000000123_S0000014	THAT'S HUMAN NATURE AND ABOUT OUR PARTICULAR
YOU1000000123_S0000016	PLACE IN THE LIFE CYCLE SO YOU MAY BE A YOUNG PERSON WHO'S THINKING ABOUT GETTING STARTED IN LIFE
YOU1000000123_S0000017	BUT WHEN YOU JOIN A ENTERPRISE OR AN ORGANIZATION YOU HAVE TO DO THINGS FOR THE ORGANIZATION
YOU1000000123_S0000018	YOU HAVE TO TAKE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE
YOU1000000123_S0000020	YOU HAVE TO HELP MANAGE A PRODUCTIVE VENTURE THAT INVOLVES MANY PEOPLE SO THERE AREN'T THAT MANY THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO AS AN INDIVIDUAL
YOU1000000123_S0000021	THAT ARE USEFUL YOU HAVE TO JOIN AN ORGANIZATION THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF HUMAN LIFE
YOU1000000123_S0000023	SO THIS IS OF COURSE ABOUT UNDERSTANDING HOW THE INSTITUTIONS WORK AND HOW WE CAN PREDICT WHAT WILL HAPPEN
YOU1000000123_S0000025	AND THINGS ARE RAPIDLY CHANGING IN THE INFORMATION AGE THAT WE LIVE IN NOW
YOU1000000123_S0000027	THAT'S WHAT THIS COURSE IS ABOUT I DON'T CONSIDER WELL I DON'T CONSIDER THIS A VOCATIONAL COURSE
YOU1000000123_S0000028	BECAUSE I THINK IT SHOULD BE OF INTEREST TO ANYBODY WHO WHO IS INTERESTED IN HOW THINGS WORK
YOU1000000123_S0000030	ON THE OTHER HAND THIS COURSE
YOU1000000123_S0000032	COMES ACROSS HAS MORE VOCATIONAL THAN MOST YALE COURSES AND TO SOME EXTENT I PRIDE MYSELF ON THAT
YOU1000000123_S0000033	ALTHOUGH I CONSIDER MYSELF AN INTELLECTUAL BUT THIS IS A RELEVANT COURSE ARIGHT IT'S NOT ABOUT HOW TO MAKE MONEY
YOU1000000123_S0000034	YOU MIGHT SAY IT IS I SUPPOSE BUT AIT'S ABOUT MAKING THINGS WORK
YOU1000000123_S0000036	THESE ARE THE TOPICS IN THIS COURSE SO RISK INSURANCE DIVERSIFICATION HISTORY OF FINANCE INNOVATION EFFICIENT MARKETS BEHAVIORAL FINANCE
YOU1000000123_S0000037	ACTUALLY BEHAVORAL FINANCE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE PROMINENT THAN YOU MIGHT THINK FROM ITS APPEARANCE AS NUMBER SEVEN ON THIS LIST
YOU1000000123_S0000038	BEHAVIORAL FINANCEIS THE APPLICATION OF PSYCHOLOGY SOCIOLOGY OTHER SOCIAL SCIENCES TO UNDERSTANDING FINANCIAL EVENTS
YOU1000000123_S0000040	IT'S A REVOLUTION IN FINANCE THAT I HAVE WATCHED OVER THE WHOLE COURSE OF IT BECAUSE I HAVE ORGANIZED CONFERENCES ON BEHAVIORAL FINANCE
YOU1000000123_S0000041	STARTING IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE WORKING WITH RICHARD THAYLOR AT UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO AND
YOU1000000123_S0000042	WE JUST WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS BUT WE JUST BEQUEATHED IT THER ARE REGULAR SEMINARS OF PROFESSORS
YOU1000000123_S0000043	TO NICK BARBARIS HERE AT THE ALE SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT
YOU1000000123_S0000045	BUT WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT BECAUSE I KIND OF BELIEVE IN A UNITY OF KNOWLEDGE
YOU1000000123_S0000046	SO THIS COURSE WILL DIFFER FROM MANY OTHER FINANCE COURSES AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT REAL PEOPLE AND HOW THINGS REALLY WORK
YOU1000000123_S0000048	
YOU1000000123_S0000050	WE TALK ABOUT DEBT THE STOCK MARKET THE REAL ESTATE MARKET REGULATION OH BY THE WAY REGULATION IS AN INTEREST OF MINE TOO
YOU1000000123_S0000051	MORE SO THAN MOST PEOPLE WHO TEACH FINANCE BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE MARKETS NEED TO BE REGULATED
YOU1000000123_S0000052	HUMAN BEINGS HAVE A TENDENCY TO BE MANIPULATIVE AND TRICKY AND FINANCE IS USED TO TRICK PEOPLE
YOU1000000123_S0000053	THAT'S WHY WE NEED REGULATORS SO YOU SHOULDN'T ASSUME THAT I WANT TO SEND YOU OFF TO WALL STREET
YOU1000000123_S0000054	I THINK THAT YOU MIGHT GO TO BE A MEMBER OF THE REGLIKE THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION OR SOMETHING ELSE AS A JOB
YOU1000000123_S0000055	AND BE PROUD OF IT OKAY IT'S IMPORTANT
YOU1000000123_S0000057	THEN BANKING FUTURES FUTURES MARKET THAT HAS A SPECIAL MEANING IN FINANCE
YOU1000000123_S0000058	MONETARY POLICY ENDOWMENT MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT BANKING OPTIONS MONEY MANAGERS EXCHANGES PUBLIC FINANCE
YOU1000000123_S0000059	NONPROFITS AND FINALLY THAT LAST LECTURE WILL BE ON THE PURPOSE OF ALL THIS B
YOU1000000123_S0000060	SO THAT'S THIS COURSE
YOU1000000123_S0000062	SO I WANTED ALSO TO JUST REFLECT ON THE RELATIVE I SAID THIS COURSE LOOKS MORE VOCATIONAL
YOU1000000123_S0000063	IN A WAY BUT I DON'T CONSIDER THIS VOCATIONAL SCHOOL THIS IS
YOU1000000123_S0000065	I'D LIKE TO SAY USEFUL A
YOU1000000123_S0000067	ONE THOUGHT I PERSPECTIVE I WANTED TO GIVE YOU WAS HOW IMPORTANT IS FINANCE ANYWAY NOW YOU UNLESS YOU GO INTO ACADEMIA
YOU1000000123_S0000068	YOU WILL GET A JOB SOMEWHERE IN THE REAL WORLD SO WHERE ARE THE JOBS
YOU1000000123_S0000069	WELLI LOOKED UP ON THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS E AS A PUBLICATION OF THE U S GOVERNMENT ON THEIR WEBSITE
YOU1000000123_S0000070	THEY HAVE DATA ON JUST HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE IN DIFFERENT PROFESSIONS IN THE UNITED STATES
YOU1000000123_S0000071	AND THEY ALSO HAVE A FORECAST SO WHAT I'M SHOWING THE LATEST DATA IS FOR THE YEAR TWENTY FOURTEEN
YOU1000000123_S0000072	AND IT HAS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THOUSANDS AND THEN ALSO ON THERE WE HAVE THE PROJECTION FOR TWENTY TWENTY FOUR
YOU1000000123_S0000073	SO YOU NOTE THAT AT THE TOP I'VE GOT FINANCE PROTHESE ARE SPECIFIC FINANCE PROFESSIONS NOT ALL FINANCE PROFESSIONS
YOU1000000123_S0000074	FINANCIAL ANALYSTS FINANCIAL MANAGERS PERSONAL FINANCIAL ADVISORS
YOU1000000123_S0000075	THEY ALL HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE BUT I WANTED YOU TO NOTE WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER MAJORS THAT YOU HAVE HERE I'M NOT DIMINISHING THEM
YOU1000000123_S0000076	BUT ECONOMICS ECONOMISTS NOT SO MANY
YOU1000000123_S0000078	BUT YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN ASTRONOMY I ACTUALLY LOVE ASTRONOMY WHEN I WAS A KID I THOUGHT I'D BE AN ASTRONOMER
YOU1000000123_S0000079	BUTI HAD TO RREACH REALITY THERE'S LOTS OF EXCITING FIELDS
YOU1000000123_S0000080	WHERE THERE ARE ALMOST NO JOBS SO THERE'S HOW MANY ASTRONOMERS ARE THERE
YOU1000000123_S0000082	SOCIOLOGISTS POLITICAL SCIENTISTS OR MATHEMATICIANS THIS IS NOT TO DIMINISH YOUR MAJORING IN THOSE FIELDS
YOU1000000123_S0000083	YOU JUST DON'T EXPECT TO GET A JOB IN THOSE FIELDS
YOU1000000123_S0000084	I ALSO PUT DOWN AT THE BOTTOM MASSAGE THERAPIST OKY I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WAS A PROFESSION
YOU1000000123_S0000085	BUT THERE'S PROJECTED TO BE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND MASSAGE THERAPISTS IN THE UNITED STATES IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR
YOU1000000123_S0000086	WE DON'T HAVE A MASSAGE THERAPY MAJOR HERE
YOU1000000123_S0000087	BUT THAT'S A SIGN OF OF
YOU1000000123_S0000089	HOW THE MARKET MAKES THINGS IMPORTANT
YOU1000000123_S0000090	NOW RANA FARAHAR MIGHT BE RIGHT ABOUT THIS THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH HAVING SO MANY FINANCE PEOPLE MAYBE WE NEED MORE MASSAGE THERAPISTS
YOU1000000123_S0000091	ATHEN FINANCE PEOPLE
YOU1000000123_S0000092	BUT THERE'S A SENSE OF REALITY THAT I THINK THAT
YOU1000000123_S0000093	PART OF THE REASON THAT THERE 'SE SO MANY OF THEM IS THAT THEY DEAL WITH IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT CAN'T BE QUICKLY
YOU1000000123_S0000094	CAN'T BE MORE EASILY SOLVED WE NEED WE NEED ALL THESE PEOPLE THAT'S WHY I TAKE SOME PRIDE IN THIS COURSE IN BEING CONNECTED TO THE REAL WORLD
YOU1000000123_S0000095	THERE ARE REAL JOB OPPORTUNITIES IN FINANCE AND THERE'R ALSO I THINK IN THE NEW INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION PERIOD
YOU1000000123_S0000096	THEY WILL STILL BE I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE FIELDS THAT IS NOT GOING TO BE
YOU1000000123_S0000098	TOTALLY REPLACED BY COMPUTER THE PROBLEM WITH FINANCE IS THAT THE THE IS HIGH INEQUALITY IN THESE IN THESE IN THIS FIELD
YOU1000000123_S0000099	SOME PEOPLE MAKE A LOT OF MONEY BUT ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE TO GIVE IT AWAY THIS IS ANOTHER THING ABOUT THIS COURSE
YOU1000000123_S0000100	IF YOU MAKE A LOT OF MONEY IN FINANCE IT'S A GAME YOU ENJOYED IT NOW GIVE MOST OF IT AWAY THAT'S GOING TO BE A THEME
YOU1000000124_S0000000	NA LONG AND SECUITOUS ROUTE IL ONLY ARRIVE AT THAT AGAIN AT THE N
YOU1000000124_S0000002	SO THERE'S BEEN A BATTLE GOING ON FOR A LONG TIME ABOUT THE NATURE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND WHAT THIS NATURE SHOULD BE
YOU1000000124_S0000003	THERE'S TWO VERY DIFFERENT APPROACHES THEYARE VERY DIFFERENT IDEOLOGIES ONE IS INSPIRED BY LOGIC
YOU1000000124_S0000004	AND SO THE IDEA IS THAT THE ESSENCE OF INTELLIGENCE IS USING SYMBOLIC RULES TO MANIPULATE SYMBOLIC EXPRESSIONS
YOU1000000124_S0000005	AND THE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVED THIS OR THE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVED IT DIDN'T THINK THIS WAS EMPIRICAL THEY THOUGHT THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD HAVE INTELLIGENCE THEY THOUGHT IT WAS SORT OF NECESSARY TRUTH HAT THAT'S WHAT INTELLIGENCE WAS GOING TO BE
YOU1000000124_S0000007	THERE'S A DIFFERENT SET OF PEOPLE WHO WERE EQUALLY IDEOLOGICAL WHO BELIEVED THAT IF YOU WANT TO MAKE AN INTELLIGENT SYSTEM YOU SHOULD LOOK TO BIOLOGY
YOU1000000124_S0000008	AND IN PARTICULAR SHEUD TRY AND UNDERSTAND HOW THE BRAIN WAS DOING
YOU1000000124_S0000010	IT DOESN'T LOOK AS IF THE BRAINS OF ANIMALS ARE DOING IT BY LOGIC OF CORSE THERE'S ALL SORTS OF DEBATES ABOUT WHETHER ANIMALS ARE INTELLIGENT BUT
YOU1000000124_S0000012	THEBIOLOGICALLY INSPIRED PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT THE ESSENCE OF INTELLIGENCE WAS LEARNING THE CONNECTION STRANGTS IN THE NEURAL NETWORK
YOU1000000124_S0000013	AND YOU CAN SEE THESE ARE TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WORLD VIEWS THEY KIND OF MISS EACH OTHER
YOU1000000124_S0000015	SO THEREWAS A BATTLE WENT ON FOR A LONG TIME IN THE NINETEEN SIXTY S THE WE HAD VERY SIMPLE NEURAL NETS AND WE HAD A SIMPLE LEARNING ALGRTHM FOR T
YOU1000000124_S0000017	THEY ONLY HAVE ONE LAIR OF FEATURES AND THEY WERE COMPLETELY WIPED OUT BY SIMMOLIC ARN
YOU1000000124_S0000019	SO WHEN I STARTED IN GRADUATE SCHOOL IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTY S IT WAS WELL KNOWN THAT NEURAL NETWORKS WERE NONSENSE THEY WERE THE PAST THEY WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING AND IT HAD BEEN PROVED THAT THEY WERE USELESS
YOU1000000124_S0000021	THAT'S WHAT I WAS TOLD AND THAT'S WHAT ALMOST EVERYBODY NOW BE
YOU1000000124_S0000023	THEN IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY S
YOU1000000124_S0000025	VARIOUS GROUPS CAME UP WITH THE BACK PROPAGATION PROCEDURE AND THAT ALLOWED NEURAL NETWORKS TO LEARN MULTIPLE LAYERS OF FEATURE
YOU1000000124_S0000027	O WE GOT OVER THIS PROBLEM THAT UNTIL THEN NEURAL NETWORKS JUST HAD HAND DESIGN FEATURES THEY WAITED THOSE FEATURES TO MAKE A DECISION AND THEN THEY MADE A DECISION
YOU1000000124_S0000028	THEY DIDN'T LEARN THEIR OWN FEATURES WITH THAT PROPAGATION WE COULD LEARN LESS OF FEATURES AND THEREW'S A LOT OF HIP ABOUT HOW THIS WAS GOING TO SOLVE EVERYTHING THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVED
YOU1000000124_S0000029	THAT IS I BELIEVED IN THE EIGHTY S THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY WAS GOING TO HAPPEN THEN AND IT DIDN'T
YOU1000000124_S0000031	TE NINETEEN NINETY S
YOU1000000124_S0000033	PEOPLE SHOWED THERE WERE OTHER MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS THAT WERE BETTER THAN BACK PROPAGATION ON MODESCT SIZED PROBLEMS THINGS CALLED SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES
YOU1000000124_S0000034	THEY HAD FANCYIER MATH AND THEY WORKED A LITTLE BIT BETTER ON WHAT WE NOW THINK OF AS VERY SMALL PROBLEMS THINGS WITH A FEW THOUSAND TRAINING EXAMPLES
YOU1000000124_S0000036	ORE AS TO WIKE DOWT AGAIN
YOU1000000124_S0000038	THEN IN ABOUT TWO THOUSAND AND SIX WE CAME UP WITH SOME TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS TO NEURAL NETWORKS THAT MADE THEM A BIT EASIER TO LEARN
YOU1000000124_S0000039	AND THAT WASN'T THE MAIN POINT AT THAT TIME WE GOT MORE COMPUTATION AND MORE DATA AND SUDDENLY NEURAL NETWORKS WITH LOTS OF LAYRS OF FEATURES WORKED AMAZINGLY WELL
YOU1000000124_S0000040	AND NOW GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK AND MICROSOFT AND APPLE AND AMAZON AND ALL THE OTHER HIGH TECH COMPANIES YOU CAN THINK OF INVLIDING EVERY ONE RE ALL BETTING THE FARM ON YOUROW NETWORKS
YOU1000000124_S0000041	THEY BELIEVE THAT'S CERTENY TO BE THE FUTURE AND THERE'S A HUGE DEMAND FOR STUDENTS WHO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT NEURAL NETWORKS
YOU1000000124_S0000043	SO THE OLY WAY TO MAKE A COMPUTER DO WHAT YOU WANTED WAS TO WRITE A PROGRAM
YOU1000000124_S0000044	WHERE YOU FIGURED OUT HOW YOU WOULD DO IT YOURSELF AND THEN YOU EXPLAIN TO THE COMPUTER IN EXQUISITE DETAIL HOW TO DO WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE DONE YOURSELF BUT A WHOLE LOT FASTER
YOU1000000124_S0000046	SO IF I WANTE TO SORT A LIST FOR EXAMPLE I WOULD FIGURE OUT WELL I'M NOT A COMPUTER SCIENTIST SHE ILL QUICKLY REALIZE
YOU1000000124_S0000047	WOULD FIGURE OUT WELL I COULD GO DOWN THE LIST AND FIND THE BIGGEST THING AND THEN PUT THAT AT THE TOP AND THEN I COULD GO DOWN THE LIST AGAIN AND FIND THE NEXT BIGGEST THING AND PUT THAT UNDERNEATH T DOZ THING
YOU1000000124_S0000048	IT'S NOT A GOOD ALGORITHM BUT I MIGHT DECIDE TO DO IT LIKE THAT AND THEN I COULD TELL THE COMPUTER TO DO THAT AND THEN THE COMPUTER WOULD SORT IT AS FASTR THAN I O
YOU1000000124_S0000050	THE NEW WAY TO DO IT IS TO YOU FIRST TELL THE COMPUTER TO PRETEND TO BE A NEURAL NETO
YOU1000000124_S0000052	THEN YOU JUST SHOW IT EXAMPLES SO YOU SHOW IT AN N EXAMPLE OF AN UNSORTED LIST AND A SORTED LIST AND YOU SHOW IT LOTS OF EXAMPLES AND YOU SAY I WANT YOU TO TAKE THESE THINGS AND PRODUCE THOSE THINGS
YOU1000000124_S0000053	AND AFTER A WHILE IT GETS THE IDEA THAT IS YOU DON'T HAVE TO WRITE THE PROGRAM
YOU1000000124_S0000055	SORTING LISTS IS SOMETHING THAT'S DIFFICULT TO DO THIS WAY RECOGNISING OBJECTS AND IMAGES IS SOMETHING THAT'S MUCH EASIER TO DO THIS
YOU1000000124_S0000057	HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING WE'D LIKE COMPUTERS TO DO AND PEOPLE IN CLASSICAL AI TRIED TO DO THIS FOR FIFTY YEARS AND THEY DIDN'T MAKE MUCH PROGRESS
YOU1000000124_S0000058	SO THE IDEA IS YOU'LL GIVE THEM THE R G B VALUES OF WHOLE BUNCH OF PIXELS AND YOU HAVE TO CONVERT THOSE TO A CAPTION THAT DESCRIBES WHAT'S IN THE IMAGE
YOU1000000124_S0000059	SO YOU GET ALL THESE NUMBERS COMING IN AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE A STRING OF WORDS COMING OUT
YOU1000000124_S0000061	AND YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW YOU MIGHT GO ABOUT WRITING A PROGRAM TO DO THAT BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE IT'S GOIN TO BE DIFFICULT
YOU1000000124_S0000062	YOU FIRST OF ALL WOULD MAYBE WRITE A PROGRAM TO FIND LITTLE PIECES OF EDGE IN THE IMAGE OR MAYBE COLOR CONTRASTS
YOU1000000124_S0000063	AND JUST DOING EVISION WOULD BE MORE THAN YOU CANLD DO
YOU1000000124_S0000065	THEN RELATING THEVISION TO THE LANGUAGE WOULD BE COMPLICATED NOW WHAT WE CAN DO IS WE CAN SOLVE THAT PROBLEM JUST BY USING MACHINE LEARNING
YOU1000000124_S0000067	WITH HARDLY ANY HAND PROVREN
YOU1000000124_S0000069	AND BY THE END OF THE LECTURE YOU'L UNDERSTAND HOW YOU DO THAT
YOU1000000124_S0000071	OKAY IS THAT LOUDER GOODOKAY I THINK MIK ES PO O TU
YOU1000000124_S0000073	SO I'M GOING TO EXPLAIN MANY OF YOU KNOW THIS ALREADY BUT I' EXPLAIN WHAT AT IT NEUROME IS IT'S A LITTLE COMPUTATIONAL DEVICE
YOU1000000124_S0000074	THAT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE A REEL NEURON BUT NOT VERY IT TAKES SOME INPUTS COMING TYPICALLY FROM OTHER NEURONS IT HAS WEIGHTS ON THE CONNECTIONS
YOU1000000124_S0000075	IT TAKES THE INPUTS TIMES THE WEIGHTS ADDS IT UP THAS HIS TOTAL INPUT AND THEN IT PUTS IT THROUGH A NONA FUNCTION
YOU1000000124_S0000076	THAT LONDON TEMTIONITTAY IS WHAT WE MOSTLY USE NOW AND THAT'S ITS OUTPUT
YOU1000000124_S0000077	SO BASICALLY THAT NON FUNPTION SIMPLY SAYS IF YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF INPUT GIVE A LOT OF OUTPUT AND IF YOUR INPUTS BELOW A THRESHOLD DON'T GIVE ANY OUTPUT
YOU1000000124_S0000078	SO IT'S CALLED A RECTIFIED VION
YOU1000000124_S0000080	THE QUESTION IS IF YOU HOOK TOGETHER A BUNCH OF THOSE GUYS AND YOU FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE THOSE WEIGHTS ON THE CONNECTIONS ADDAPT WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH IT
YOU1000000124_S0000082	SO WE TYPICALLY HOOK THEM TOGETHER BY MAKING MULTIPLE LAYERS THIS AGAIN IS SORT OF NEURALY INSPIRED AND IF YOU LOOK AT A MULTILA NEURO NARO LIKE THAT
YOU1000000124_S0000084	THE LAYERS IN THE MIDDLE IT'S HARD TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE WEIGHT SHOULD BE WHEN YOU ADAPT THOSE WEIGHTS IN EFFECT YOU'RE DECIDING WHAT FEATURES
YOU1000000124_S0000085	THE NENS IN THE MIDDLE EST SHOUL DETECT SO THE PROBEM OF ADDAPTING THOSE WAIGHTS AND THERE'S PROBLEM OF DECIDING WHAT INTERMEDIATE FEATURES DO YOU WANT THEY'R THE SAME PROBEM
YOU1000000124_S0000087	I GIN SHOW YOU A WAY OF LEARNING THOSE FETURES THAT'S REALLY STUPID
YOU1000000124_S0000088	BUTWITEE WORK WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU INPUTS AND WE'RE GOING TO TELL YOU ALL THE RIGHT ANSWERS
YOU1000000124_S0000089	AND THEN WE'R GOING TO ADUCT THE WTES ONE AT A TIME
YOU1000000124_S0000091	SO SUPPOSE YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT WILL TELL THE DIFFERENCE BTEEN PICTURES OF CATS AND PICTURES OF DOGS WE GIVE I TWO OUTTS ONE OFR CAT ON TE O
YOU1000000124_S0000092	AND IF YOU SHOWI A CAT AND THE ANKLE OF TA DOG IS HIGHER THAN THE ANKLE OF HE CAT THAT'S BAD SO WE CAN SHOW IT A BUNCH OF PICTURES AND MEASURE HOW WELL IT'S DOING
YOU1000000124_S0000094	THEN WE CAN PICK ONE OF THE WEIGHTS IN THE NETWORK AND WE CAN CHANGE THE VALUE OF THAT WEIGHT
YOU1000000124_S0000096	AN WE CAN SEE IF THE NETWORK'S DOING BETTER OR WORSE THAN IT WAS BEFORE TO SEE THAT YOU NEED TO SHOW A BUNCH OF EXAMPLES
YOU1000000124_S0000097	NIF THE CHANGE WORKED WE KEEP IT ND TLEN WE DO IT AGAIN ANOTHER WA
YOU1000000124_S0000099	NOW I THINK YOU CAN SEE THAT THAT ALGORITHM IS GOING TO HAVE TO SHOW A BUNCH OF EXAMPLES FOR EACH WEIGHT AF IF YOU'VE GOT A MILLION WEIGHTS IT'S GOING TO BE EXTREMELY SLOW
YOU1000000124_S0000101	THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO DO WE WANT TO CHANGE WEIGHTS IN THE DIRECTION THAT MAKES THEM HEALTH THAT'S ALL WE'RE TRYING TO DO WE'RE JUST TRYING TO DO THAT EFFICIENTLY
YOU1000000124_S0000102	AND BY PROPAGATION WHICH MANY OF YOU KNOW BUT I'M NOT GOING TO EXPLAIN THAT
YOU1000000124_S0000103	IS JUST AN EFFICIENT WAY OF COMPUTING HOW TO CHANGE THE WEIGHTS IN THE DIRECTION THAT WILL HELP REDUCE THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN WHAT THE NETWORK OUTPUTS AND WHAT YOU'D LIKE IT TO OUTPUT
YOU1000000124_S0000105	AND THE BIG DIFFERENCE IS THAT IF YOU PERTURB THE WEIGHTS YOU MEASURE THE EFFECTS OF A CHANGE OF WEIGHT ON THE OUTPUT
YOU1000000124_S0000106	AND WITH BAT PROPOGATION YOU COMPUTE THE EFFECTS SO IF YOU KNOW ALL THE WAYTS RON THE NETWORK YOU DON'T HAVE TO MEASURE YOU CANCOMPUTE
YOU1000000124_S0000107	AND WHEN YOU COMPUTE YOU CAN COMPUTE FOR ALL THE WEIGHTS AT THE SAME TIME WHAT DIRECTION YOU SHOULD CHANGE THEM TO HELP
YOU1000000124_S0000108	YOU CAN'T DO THAT WHEN YOU'RE MEASURING YOU HAVE TO CHANGE TI NEES A TIME
YOU1000000124_S0000110	SO MEASURING SO COMPUTING IS MUCH MOR ERITINL N MEASUREMENG EVOLUTION CAN'T DO THE SAME MEASURING CAN'T DO THE SAME COMPUTING ALGORITHM BECAUSE IN EVOLUTION YOU CHANGE A GENE
YOU1000000124_S0000111	AND THEN THERE'S A WHOLE DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESS IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND YOU DON'T KNOW ALL THAT SO YOU CAN'T BY PROPEGATE THROUGH I
YOU1000000124_S0000113	O WHAT EVOLUTION DID WAS IT CAME UP WITH THE BRAIN SO THAT IT COULD USE BACKRON VISEN THAT'S MENT
YOU1000000124_S0000114	SO BAT PROPIGATION YOU GO FORWARD THROUGH THESE LAYERS YOU COMPARE WITH THE CORRECT ANSWER YOU BACK PROPIGATE SIGNALS THAT ALLOWS YOU TO COMPUTE FO EACH WETE WHAT DIRECTION TO CHANGE IT IN TO MAKE IT WORK BETTER
YOU1000000124_S0000116	AND WE THOUGHT IN THE EIGHTY S THAT WAS PROBLEM SOLVEING WECAN NOW LEARN LOTS OF THOSE AND IT DIDN'T WORK VERY WELL
YOU1000000124_S0000118	WE DIDN'T KNOW WHY IT DIDN'T WORK MOST PEOPLE THOUGHT IT DIDN'T WORK BECAUSETHIS WAS A STUPID IDEA THAT IS THE IDEA THAT YOU WOULD TAKE A NETWORK WITH RANDOM WEIGHTS
YOU1000000124_S0000119	AND YOU JUST SHOW IT ALL I DATA AD AS A RESULT OF SEEING THIS DATA BE ABLE TO DESIGN ALL HITS OWN FEATURE DRETECTORS
YOU1000000124_S0000120	AND DO VERY GOOD PERFORMANCE AT THINGS LIKE MACHINE TRANSLATION OR RECOGNIZING OBJECTS AND IMAGES OR RECOGNISING SPEECH
YOU1000000124_S0000122	ALMOST EVERYBODY N I THOUGHT THAT IDEA WAS COMPLETELY CRAZY UA FEW OF US DIDN'T A FEW OF US JUST THOUGHT WE DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S NOT WORKING TH
YOU1000000124_S0000123	IT'S OBVIOUSLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND WE DISCOVERED LATER THE REASON IT WASN'T WORKING WAS AUSE COMPUTERS WERE TOO SLOW AND DATA SETS WEREN'T BGOG
YOU1000000124_S0000124	IF YOU SAID THAT IN THE EIGHTY S PEOPLE WOULD SAY OH YEH SURE IF YOU HAD BIGGER COMPUTER AND MORE DATA IT WOULD WORK BUT LOOK IT DOESN'T WORK IT TURNED OUT THAT WAS RIGHT
YOU1000000124_S0000125	AND WHEN WE GOT A BIGGER COMPUTER AND MORE DATA IT WORKED NOW THERE WAR SOME TECHNICAL THINGS TOO BUT IT WAS MAINLY THE INCREASING COMPUTER SPEED AND DATA SIZE THAT MATTERED
YOU1000000124_S0000128	SO I'M GONNO SHOW YOU A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES BEFORE I GET BACK TO THE ISSUE OF W TORTES
YOU1000000124_S0000130	EXAMPLE THAT PROBABLY HAD THE MOST IMPACT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE THERE WAS A BIG PUBLIC COMPETITION WHERE YOU HAVE A THOUSAND DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBJECTS AND A MILLION TRAINING IMMAGES
YOU1000000124_S0000131	AND YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO RECOGNIZE T DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBJECT AND THERE'S A SECRET TEST SET SO YOU CAN'T TUNE ON THE TESTSET
YOU1000000124_S0000132	AND ITS COUNTED AS RIGHT IF YOU GET THE CORRECT CLASS IN YOUR TOP FIVE BETS BECAUSE IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT THE RIGHT BET IS FOR SOMEONE
YOU1000000124_S0000133	REXAMPLE YOU HAVE A IMAGE WHICH HAS A DOMNATION ON A BOWL OF CHERRIES ANDSAM DOMNATION AS SAYING CHERRIES ONE OF THOSE IS RIGHT AND IF YOU SAY BOTH YOU'RE GONG TO GET IT RIGHT
YOU1000000124_S0000136	SO OT OF THE BEST EXISTING COMPUTER VISION METHODS WERE USED AND THE RESULTS LOOKE LIKE THIS
YOU1000000124_S0000138	RESULTS AT THE TOP ARE WHERE WE ARE NOW THERESULTS BELOW
YOU1000000124_S0000140	TWO MY GRADUATE STUDENTS UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO MANAGED TO GET SIXTEEN PERCENT ERRO
YOU1000000124_S0000141	AND THEN THE BEST COMPUTER VISION GROUPS WERE GETTING MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE PERCENT E
YOU1000000124_S0000142	SO WE ALMOST HAED THE ERROR RATE AND THAT HAD A HUGE IMPACT ON COMPUTER VISION ALMOST EVERNIGHT THAT IS WITHIN A YEAR
YOU1000000124_S0000143	ALL THE LEADING PEOPLE CHANGED FROM DOING HAND TUNE THINGS DOING WHAT THEY WERE DOING BEFORE TO DOING NEURON NETS
YOU1000000124_S0000144	AND SO IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN IF YOU SENT A PAPER USING YOUR ONETTS TO A COMPUTER VISION CONFERENCE IT WOULD BE REJECTED BECAUSE IT WAS USING YOURONEZS
YOU1000000124_S0000145	AND BY TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN IF YOU SEND A PAPER TO COMVUTE VISION CONFERENCE IT WIULD BE REJECTED IF IT WASN'T USING ANS TER'S REALLY NO CHAGE
YOU1000000124_S0000147	OKAY IT WAS OBVIOUS IF TWO GRAD STUDENTS CAN BET THE BEST COMPUTER VISION RESEARCHERS WHO'VE BEEN DOING THIS STUFF FOR THIRTY YEARS THEN YOU'RE GOING TO DEVELOP A LOT FURTHER
YOU1000000124_S0000148	AND THINGS DID BY TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN THE ERROR RATE ON INET WAS DOWN TO FIVE PERCENT WHICH IS ABOUT THE HUMAN EROR RAGE AND NOWT'S DOWN TO THREE PERCENT IT'S INCREDIBLY DIFFERENT
YOU1000000124_S0000150	SOLJUST SHOW YOU SOME EXAMPLES OF THAT KIND OF OCERECOGITION
YOU1000000124_S0000152	THERE'S AN IMAGE AND THE RIGHT ANSWER IF CHETER AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE WHAT THE NEUROLNET SAYS IT'S VERY CONFIDENT THAT CHETE IS THE RIGHT ANSWER
YOU1000000124_S0000153	AND IT HAS A FEW OTHER THINGS IT THINKS AREN'T TOTALLY OUTOF THE QUESTION LIKE LEOPHARD AND SNOWDAPED AND N EGYPTIAN CAT SO THE POINT IS ALL ITS BACKUP ANSWERS ARE VERY SENSIBLE ANSWERS
YOU1000000124_S0000154	AND NOTICE THAT'S NOT A SORT OF TYPICAL IMAGE OF A CHETER HALF THE HEAD'S MISSING AND IT'S A CHEETER POSE UP RIGHT
YOU1000000124_S0000155	IT'S NOT A SORT OF CLASSIC IT'S NOT THE DIAGRAME MAKEIN A CHEATER JUST SSHOW SOMEBODY WHAT A CHEATER IS
YOU1000000124_S0000157	S A BULLET TRAIN AND YOU'LL NOTICE THE BULLET TRAIN PROBABLY OCCUPIES LESS THAN TEN PERCENT OF THE PIXELS THE BUILDING IN THE BACKGROUND IS MUCH BIGGER
YOU1000000124_S0000158	THERE'S A PLATFORM THERE'S A PERSONON T PLATFORM BUT IT SORT OF KNOWS WHAT THE RIGHT ANSWERIS LIKELY TO BE BECAUSE IT'S UNDERSTOOD ABOUT THE FOCUS OF IMAGES
YOU1000000124_S0000159	T YOU PUT THE THING YOU WANT TO ATTEND TO IN THE MIDDLE AND ALITS LTERNATIVE ANSWERS ARE QUITE REASONABLE
YOU1000000124_S0000161	ES WHEN MOGAS I WRON
YOU1000000124_S0000163	SO THE CORRECT ANSWER IS HANGUS
YOU1000000124_S0000165	IT THINKS THE BEST ANSWER IS SISSORS AND YOU CAN SORT OF SEE WHY I MIHT TIN CISSORS YOU CAN SEE BETTER WHY I MIGHTTING FRYNG PA
YOU1000000124_S0000166	IT DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THING THAT I THINK MUST BE A CHAIN IS IN THE HANDLE OF A FRYING PAN BASICALLYI NEEDS GLASSES U
YOU1000000124_S0000167	YOUCN SEE WHY I SAY STETHOSCOPE BUT THE IMPORTANT THING HERE IS THAT ALL THE WRONG ANSWERS ARE VISUALLY PLAUSIBLE WRONG ANSWERS
YOU1000000124_S0000168	GIVE YOU AN IDEA TAT IT UNDERSTANDS A LOT ABOUT WHAT THINGS LOOK LIKE
YOU1000000124_S0000170	OKAYSO THAT HAS HUGE EFFECT ON COMPUTER VISION AND THEN A FEW YEARS LATER
YOU1000000124_S0000171	SOME VERY GREAT PEOPLE INCLUDING NGE SASKIA WHO WAS ONE O PHEO DID THE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE IMAGE NET SYSTEM U
YOU1000000124_S0000173	DECIDED THEYR TRANGEURAL NETS ON MACHINE TRANSLATION AND MACHINE TRANSLATION OUGHT TO BE THE PERFECT PROBLEM FOR SYMBOLIC AI
YOU1000000124_S0000174	SO PEOPLE IN SYMBOLIC AI I MEAN WE ALL AGREE THAT SYMBOLS COME IN AND SYMBOLS COME OUT OKAY
YOU1000000124_S0000175	THE QUESTION IS WHAT'S IN BETWEEN IS IT JUST MORE SYMBOLS
YOU1000000124_S0000176	SO THE CLASSIC AI VIEW IS SYMBOLS COME IN WHAT'S INSIDE IS SORT OF LIKE SYMBOLS IS SORT OF CLEANED UP SYMBOLS
YOU1000000124_S0000177	IT'S SYMBOLIC EXPRESSIONS AND YOU DO MANIPULATIONS ON SYMBOLIC EXPRESSIONS AND THEN ANOTHER SYMBOL STRING COMES OUT SO IT'S CALL SYMBOLS
YOU1000000124_S0000179	THE BIOLOGICAL VIEW WOULD BE SYMBOLS COME IN THEY'RE THE WAY WE CODE THINGS TO GO OVER A COMMUNICATION CHANNEL
YOU1000000124_S0000180	THEY RESIST NOISE NICELY ONCE THE SYMBOLS AVE COME IN THEY GET CONVERTED INTO THINGS THAT ARE NOTHING LIKE THOSE SYMBOLS
YOU1000000124_S0000182	SO THE POINT ABOUT A SYMBOL IS IT ONLY HAS BASICALLY ONE PROPERTY A SYMBOL EITHER IS OR IS NOT IDENTICAL TO ANOTHER SYMBL
YOU1000000124_S0000184	TAKE TWO DIFFERENT SYMBOLS THE ONLY PROBETY THAT MAT IS ARE THEY THE SAME SYMBOL
YOU1000000124_S0000186	OKAYALL THE OTHER PROPERTIES ARE JUST
YOU1000000124_S0000188	ARBRITARY PROPERTIS OF THE SYMBOL THAT ARE NOT RELEVANT TO THE PROCESS
YOU1000000124_S0000190	IN NEURALNETS WHAT HAPPENS IS A SYMBOL COMES IN AND IT GETS CONVERTED INTO A GREAT BIG VECTOR THAT HAS ALL SORTS OF FEATURES
YOU1000000124_S0000191	THAT CAPTURE LOTS OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE MEANING OF THAT WORD
YOU1000000124_S0000193	AND WORDS THAT MEAN SIMILAR THINGS BUT DON'T LOOK SIMILAR LIKE FRIDAY AND WEDNESDAY
YOU1000000124_S0000195	THEY MEAN PRETTY SIMILAR THINGS THEYR DISTINCT SYMBOLS
YOU1000000124_S0000197	THERE'S NOTHING WELL THE'S THE MORPHENIC STRUCTURE OF DAYN THAT'S BAN EXAMPLE BUT BUT BASICALLY THE
YOU1000000124_S0000199	THEYRE DISTINCT SYMBOLS AND THAT'S ALL A SYMBOL PROCESSING SYSTEM KNOWS IN A NEURAL NET IT LEARNS THAT WEDNESDAY AND FRIDAY ARE VERY VERY SIMILAR THINGS AD WE'LL SEE THAT LATE
YOU1000000124_S0000201	SO THE SYMBOLIC APPROACH TO MACHINE TRANSLATION IS TO SAY OKAY A SYMBLE STRING COMES IN IN ENGLISH
YOU1000000124_S0000202	E GO DO SOME MANIPULATIONS USING RULES NWE'RE CLEARLY GOING TO USE RULES OF GRAMMA BUT WE'RE ALSO GOINTA USE SEMANTIC RULES THAT SOMEHOW DO COMPOSITIONAL SEMANTIC
YOU1000000124_S0000203	THATIS GIVEN WHAT THE INDIVIDUAL PIECES MEAN THEY FIGURE OUT WHAT A GROUP OF PIECES MUST MEAN AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO PRODUCE SYMBOLS COMING IN
YOU1000000124_S0000205	WE'RE GOING TO USE ALL THE KNOWLEDGE THAT LINGUISTS HAVE ABOUT HOW LANGUAGE WORKS
YOU1000000124_S0000207	NEURAL NETWORK APPROACH NOW EVEN I THOUGHT THIS WAS A BIT CRAZY A BIT AMBITIOUS
YOU1000000124_S0000208	IS TO SAY LET'S JUST TAKE A WHOLE BUNCH OF TRANSLATIONS PAIRS OF AN ENGLISH SENTENCE AND A FRENCH SENTENCE
YOU1000000124_S0000210	ND WE'LL STICK IN THE IMAGE CENTERS ONE WORD AT A TIME AND THEN W'LL GO INTO A RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK WHICH I'LL EXPLAIN IN A MINUT WHERE THINGS CYCLE AROUND INSIDE
YOU1000000124_S0000212	AFTER WE FINISH STICKING IN THE ENGLISH SENTENCE THAT RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK WILL HAVE SOME PARTICULAR STATE OF ACTIVITY AND WE'LL CALL THAT A THOUGHT FACTOR
YOU1000000124_S0000214	THAT'S WHAT A THOUGHT IS IT'S THE STATE OF ACTIVITY OF THE NEURALNET AFTER HIT'S READ THE ENGLISH SENTENCE
YOU1000000124_S0000216	AND YOU'LL NOTICE IF YOU THINK ABOUT HOW THE WORD THOUGHT WORKS IN ENGLISH I CAN SAY O
YOU1000000125_S0000000	WELL I'LL TELL YOU A COUPLE OF STRANGE THINGS THAT THAT THINGS THAT I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THE FIRST IS WHEN WE'VE DONE THE ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF THE FUTURE AUTHORING PROGRAM
YOU1000000125_S0000001	IT HAS HAD A DIFFERENTDIFFERENTIAL IMPACT ON MEN
YOU1000000125_S0000002	AND IT'S HAD A PARTICULARLY DIFFERENTIAL IMPACT ON WHAT I WOULD CALL EXCLUDED MEN
YOU1000000125_S0000003	AND SO THAT WOULD BE NON WESTERN ETHNIC MINORITY MEN OR OR WHAT
YOU1000000125_S0000004	MAJORITY MEN WHO AREN'T DOING VERY WELL SO FOR EXAMPLE AT MOHAWK COLLEGE
YOU1000000125_S0000005	THE FUATURE AUTHORING PROGRAM HAD A PARTICULARLY ROBUST EFFECT ON MOHAWK COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO WERE MEN WHO HADN'T DONE VERY WELL IN HIGH SCHOOL AND WHO HADN'T PICKED A MAJOR
YOU1000000125_S0000006	TAT HAD A DESTINATION A CAREER DESTINATION AT ITS END
YOU1000000125_S0000007	SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THOSE PEOPLE ARE THEY HAVE AN AMBIGUOUS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE IDEA OF EDUCATION
YOU1000000125_S0000008	AND THEY'RE NOT ORIENTED SPECIFICALLY TOWARDS A GOAL THEY'RE NOT VERY MOTIVATED
YOU1000000125_S0000010	NOW WHY DID IT HAVE A DIFFERENTIAL EFFECT ON MEN THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION
YOU1000000125_S0000012	WELL FIRST OF ALL THE WOMEN ARE DOING BETTER
YOU1000000125_S0000013	SO IT MIGHT JUST BE A MATTER OF THE FACT THAT IT DOES BETTER FOR PEOPLE WHO AREN'T DOING AS WELL AND AT THE MOMENT MOST OF THEM ARE MEN
YOU1000000125_S0000014	I DON'T BELIEVE I THINK THAT MIGHT BE PART OF IT BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S ALL OF IT
YOU1000000125_S0000015	I THINK THAT PART OF THE REASON THAT WOMEN ARE DOING BETTER IS BECAUSE THEY'RE AGREEABLE AND SO IF A SYSTEM SETS OUT A STRUCTURE AND SAYS HERE'S A PATHWAY TO ATTAINMENT
YOU1000000125_S0000016	THE WOMEN WON'T REBEL AGAINST THAT THEY'LL GO ALONG WITH IT AND THAT'S WORKING VERY WELL FOR THEM AT THE MOMENT
YOU1000000125_S0000017	THE MEN ESPECIALLY THE MEN ON THE DISAGREEABLE END OF THE DISTRIBUTION AND THERE'S WAY MORE MEN ON THE DISTRIDISAGREEABLE END OF THE DISTRIBUTION THAN THERE ARE WOMEN
YOU1000000125_S0000018	RIGHT THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FROM IF YOU LOOK AT OVERLAPPING NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS SO THERE'S THE MALE DISTRIFEMALE DISTRIBUTION FOR AGREEABLENESS
YOU1000000125_S0000019	MALE DISTRIBUTION FOR AGREEABLENESS TREMENDOUS OVER
YOU1000000125_S0000021	WOMEN ARE HIGHER ALL THE REALLY AGREEABLE PEOPLE ARE WOMEN ALL THE REALLY DISAGREEABLE PEOPLE ARE MEN AND MAYBE THE REAL DIFFERENCES OCCUR AT THE EXTREMES RIGHT SO
YOU1000000125_S0000022	SO AND IT'S IT'S A VERY INTERESTING SIDE EFFECT OF OVERLAPPING DISTRIBUTIONS SO THEY PEOPLE CAN BE MOSTLY THE SAME BUT THAT CAN STILL PRODUCE RADICAL DIFFERENCES
YOU1000000125_S0000024	DISAGREEABLE MEN WON'T DO ANYTHING THEY DON'T WANTTO DO
YOU1000000125_S0000026	THEY JUST SAY UP YOURS I'LL GO HOME AND PLAY VIDEO GAMES E WITH YOUN I'M NOT LISTENING TO YOUR STUPID CLASSES AND WHY SHOULD I WORK FOR YOU I'LL JUST GO HAVE FUN
YOU1000000125_S0000027	I'LL DO MY OWN THING I DON'T THINK THEY'RE MOTIVATED AND SO THEN IF YOU TAKE THE MEN WHO ARE LIKE THAT AND YOU SAY OKY WHAT DO YOU WANT
YOU1000000125_S0000029	YOU CAN HAVE WHAT YOU WANT BUT YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS SO THEN THEY WRITE DOWN WHAT THEY WANT THEY THINK OH HEY WELL THAT MIGHT BE WORTH HAVING SO MAYBE I'LL PUT SOME EFFORT INTO IT
YOU1000000125_S0000030	THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TO ME NOW YOU KNOW THAT'S WEAK EVIDENCE AND THIS IS A WEAK ARGUMENT BUT I'M TRYING TO STRETCH OUT MY UNDERSTANDING TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS BUT I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S REALLY WEIRD
YOU1000000125_S0000031	I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS EITHER SO
YOU1000000125_S0000033	MORE THAN NINETY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE WHO WATCH MY VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE ARE MEN NOW THAT'S WEIRD BECAUSE ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT OF PSYCHOLOGY STUDENTS ARE WOMEN
YOU1000000125_S0000034	SO THAT IS NOT WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT RIGHT YOU'LD EXPECT THAT THE MAJORITY OF THEM WOULD BE WOMEN AND YOU MIGHT SAY WELL IT'S BECAUSE OF THE POLITICAL STANCE I'VE TAKEN
YOU1000000125_S0000035	AND I THOUGHT WELL THAT'S POSSIBLE SO I WENT AND LOOKED AT THE DEMOGRAPHIC DATA BECAUSE I HAVE THAT WELL BEFORE I DID ANY OF THE POLITICAL VIDEOS EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF MY VIEWERS WERE MEN
YOU1000000125_S0000036	SO IT'S ACTUALLY INCREASED A BIT IT'S INCREASED BY SIX PERCENT AND THAT'S NOT TRIVIAL BUT IT WAS STILL OVERWHELMINGLY MEANT
YOU1000000125_S0000037	SO THAT WAS INTERESTING I THOUGHT WHAT THE HELL WHY IS THAT EXACTLY AND THEN NOW I'VE BEEN WATCHING CROWDS WHEN I'VE BEEN TALKING TO THEM AND THE CROWDS THAT HAVE COME TO SEE ME IN PERSON
YOU1000000125_S0000038	THIS HAPPENED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO FREE SPEECH DEBATE AND I ACTUALLY NOTICED IT AND COMMENTED ON IT BEFORE THE DEBATE TOOK PLACE BECAUSE I WAS TALKING ABOUT INTRINSIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN
YOU1000000125_S0000039	AND I LOOKED AROUND THE ROOM AND I THOUGHT HEY EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM ARE MEN SO I HAD ALL THE MEN STAND WIN WOMEN STAND UP AND THEN ALL THE MEN STAND UP I SAID LOOK LIKE
YOU1000000125_S0000040	HERE'S A NATURAL EXPERIMENT FOR SOME REASON EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE WHO SHOWED UP TO THIS ARE MEN NOW EVERYBODY THOUGHT I WAS KIND OF CRACKED TO TO DO THAT
YOU1000000125_S0000041	AND IT WAS A RISK YOU KNOW AND AND I BUT I THOUGHT NO THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON HERE AND THEN WHAT'S INTERESTING NOW IS THAT EVERY PUBLIC APPEARANCE THAT I'VE MADE
YOU1000000125_S0000042	THAT'S RELATED TO THE SORT OF TOPICS THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING IS OVERWHELMINGLY MEN IT'S LIKE IT'S LIKE EIGHTY FIVE TO NINETY PERCENT
YOU1000000125_S0000043	AND SO I THOUGHT WOW THAT'S WEIRD LIKE WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON HERE EXACTLY AND THEN THE OTHER THING I'VE NOTICED IS THAT
YOU1000000125_S0000044	I'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT TO THE CROWDS THAT I'VE BEEN TALKING TO NOT ABOUT RIGHTS BUT ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY RIGHT
YOU1000000125_S0000045	BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HAVE THE BLOODY CONVERSWHAT ARE YOU DOING YOU CAN'T HAVE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT RIGHTS WITHOUT THE CONVERSATION ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE
YOU1000000125_S0000046	YOUR RIGHTS ARE MY RESPONSIBILITY THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE TECHNICALLY SO YOU JUST CAN'T HAVE ONLY HALF OF THAT DISCUSSION
YOU1000000125_S0000047	AND WE'RE ONLY HAVING HALF THAT DISCUSSION AN THE QUESTION IS WELL WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU LEAVING OUT IF YOU ONLY HAVE THAT HALF OF THE DISCUSSION
YOU1000000125_S0000048	AND THE ANSWER IS WELL YOU'RE LEAVING OUT RESPONSIBILITY AND THEN THE QUESTION IS WEL WHAT ARE YOU LEAVING OUT IF YOU'RE LEAVING OUT RESPONSIBILITY AND THE ANSWER MIGHT BE WELL MAYBE YOU'RE LEAVING OUT THE MEANING OF LIFE
YOU1000000125_S0000050	HAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TO ME IT'S LIKE HERE YOU ARE SUFFERING AWAY WHAT MAKES IT WORTHWHILE RIGHTS
YOU1000000125_S0000051	YOU KNOW YOU'RE COMPLETELY OT YOU'RE COMPLETELY YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE YOU IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE HOW BAD AN IDEA THAT IS
YOU1000000125_S0000053	RESPONSIBILITY
YOU1000000125_S0000055	THAT'S WHAT GIVES LIFE MEANING IT'S LIKE LIFT A LOAD THEN YOU CAN TOLERATE YOURSELF RIGHT BECAUSE LOOK AT YOU'RE USELESS EASILY HURT
YOU1000000125_S0000056	EASILY KILLED WHY SHOULD YOU HAVE ANY SELF RESPECT THAT'S THE STORY OF THE FALL PICK SOMETHING UP AND CARRY IT PIK MAKE IT HEAVY ENOUGH SO THAT YOU CAN THINK
YOU1000000125_S0000057	YEAH WELL USELESS AS I AM AT LEAST I CALD MOVE THAT FROM THERE TO THERE WELL WHAT'S REALLY COOL ABOUT THAT IS THAT WHEN I TALK TO THESE CROWDS ABOUT THIS
YOU1000000125_S0000058	THE MEN'S EYES LIGHT UP AND THAT'S VERY LIKE I'VE SEEN THAT PHENOMENON BECAUSE I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS MYTHOLOGICAL MATERIAL FOR A LONG TIME AND I CAN SEE WHEN I'M WATCHING CROWDS PEOPLE YOU KNOW THEIR EYEBROWS LIFT
YOU1000000125_S0000059	THER EYES LIGHT UP BECAUSE I PUT SOMETHING TOGETHER FOR THEM THAT'S WHAT MYTHOLOGICAL STORIES DO SO I'M NOT TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT THAT'S WHAT THE STORIES DO
YOU1000000125_S0000060	I SAY THE STORY AND PEOPLE GO CLICK CLICK CLICK YOU KNOW AND THEIR EYES LIGHT UP BUT THIS RESPONSIBILITY THING THAT'S A WHOLE NEW ORDER OF THIS IS THAT YOUNG MEN ARE SO HUNGRY FOR
YOU1000000125_S0000061	IT IS UNBELIEVABLE AND ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE BEEN TALKING TO SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN RUNNING FOR THE CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP IN CANADA AND I'VE BEEN TALKING TO THEM ABOUT
YOU1000000125_S0000062	WELL THE DIFFICULTIES THEY HAVE COMMUNICATING WITH YOUNG PEOPLE BECAUSE CONSERVATIVES WHAT WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY GOING TO SELL TO YOUNG PEOPLE RIGHT BECAUSE BEING CONSERVATIVE IS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE OLDER THEY CAN SELL RESPONSIBILITY
YOU1000000125_S0000064	NO ONE'S SELLING IT AND THE THING IS FOR MEN THERE'S NOTHING BUT RESPONSIBILITY YOU KNOW I WAS WATCHING THE SIMPSONS THE OTHER DAY I WATCHED THE FIRST SIMPSONS EPISODE I
YOU1000000125_S0000065	AND I DECONSTRUCTED
YOU1000000125_S0000067	SO IT'S REALLY INTERESTING SO WHAT HAPPENS IN THE FIRST SIMPSON EPISODE IS THAT IT'S CHRISTMAS AND HOMER AND MARGE ARE GOING TO BUY SOME CHRISTMAS PRESENTS BUT HOMER DOESN'T GET HIS CHRISTMAS BONUS
YOU1000000125_S0000068	AND SO HE'S ABSOLUTELY CRUSHED BY THAT AND THAT ACTUALLY IS A RECURRING THEME IN THE SIMPSONS WHERE HOMER LOSES HIS JOB OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR CAN'T MAKE ENOUGH MONEY
YOU1000000125_S0000069	HE'S COMPLETELY CRUSHED EVEN THOUGH HE'S KIND OF USELESS BUMBLING LAUGHING FOOL OF A GUY YOU KNOW
YOU1000000125_S0000070	THE THING THAT GIVES THAT SHOW HIS SOUL IS THAT HE'S STILL ORIENTED TOWARDS HIS FAMILY TAT'S WHAT MAKES HIM HONORABLE IS THAT FOOLISH AS HE IS
YOU1000000125_S0000071	HE'S DECIDED TO ADOPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS FAMILY AND TO TRY TO BEAR THAT AND SO HE'S NOT HE'S A WHOLLY FOOL HE'S NOT A COMPLETE FOOL
YOU1000000125_S0000072	AND IT'S SO INTERESTING WATCHING THE STORY BECAUSE HE SUFFERS DREADFULLY AS A CONSEQUENCE OF NOT BEING ABLE TO FULFILL HIS RESPONSIBILITY WELL THAT'S FOR MEN
YOU1000000125_S0000073	WOMEN HAVE THEIR SETS OF RESPONSIBILITIES THEY'RE NOT THE SAME RIGHT BECAUSE AND THEY'RE COMPLICATED BECAUSE WOMEN OF COURSE HAVE TO TAKE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY
YOU1000000125_S0000074	FOR HAVING INFANTS AT LEAST BUT THEN ALSO FOR CARING FOR THEM THEY'RE THEY'RE STRUCTURED DIFFERENTLY THAN MEN
YOU1000000125_S0000076	FOR BIOLOGICAL NECESSITY EVEN IF IT'S NOT A PSYCHOLOGICAL ISSUE AND IT'S ALSO PARTLY A PSYCHOLOGICAL ISSUE WOMEN KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO MEN HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY HAVE
YOU1000000125_S0000077	AND IF THEY HAVE NOTHING WORTH LIVING FOR THEN THEY STAY PETER PAN
YOU1000000125_S0000079	WHY THE HELL NOT
YOU1000000125_S0000081	BECAUSE THE ALTERNATIVE TO VALUED RESPONSIBILITY IS
YOU1000000125_S0000083	IMPULSIVE LOW CLASS PLEASURE AND YOU SAW THAT IN THE PINOCHIOS STORY RIGHT THAT'S PLEASURE ISLAND IT'S LIKE WELL WHY LIFT A LOAD IF THERE'S NOTHING IN IT FOR YU
YOU1000000125_S0000085	THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT WE'RE DOING TO MEN THAT'S A VERY BAD IDEA AND TO BOYS IT'S
YOU1000000125_S0000087	YOU'RE PATHOLOGICAL AND OPPRESSIVE IT'S LIKE FINE THEN WHY THE HELL AM I GOINGTA PLAY IF THAT'S THE IF THAT'S THE SITUATION IF I GET NO CREDIT FOR BEARING RESPONSIBILITY
YOU1000000125_S0000088	AN BLOODY WELL BE SURE I'M NOT GOING TO BEAR ANY BUT THEN YOU KNOW YOUR LIFE IS USELESS AND MEANINGLESS AND YOU HAVE YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE FULL OF SELF CONTEMPT AND NIALISM AND
YOU1000000125_S0000089	AND THAT'S NOT GOOD AND SO THAT'S WHY I THINK ITHAT'S WHAT I THINK'S GOING ON AT A DEEPER LEVEL WITH REGARDS TO MEN NEEDING THIS DIRECTION
YOU1000000125_S0000090	A MAN HAS TO DECIDE THAT HE'S GOING TO DO SOMETHING HE HAS TO DECIDE THAT
YOU1000000125_S0000091	YEAH WELL YOU KNOW PARTLY WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IN THE FUTURE AUTHORING PROCESS IS SAY OKAY WELL WHAT'S YOUR HIGHEST VALUE RIGHT IT'S THE STAR IT'S LIKE OKY WHAT ARE YO AIMING FOR
YOU1000000125_S0000092	YOU CAN DECIDE MAN BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME CRITERIA IT SHOULD BE GOOD FOR YOU IT SHOULD BE GOOD FOR YOU IN A WAY THAT FACILITATES YOU MOVING FORWARD
YOU1000000125_S0000093	MAYBE IT SHOULD BE GOOD FOR YOU IN A WAY THAT'S ALSO GOOD FOR THE FAMILY AND THE COMMUNITY IT SHOULD COVER THE THE DOMAIN OF LIFE
YOU1000000125_S0000094	MEAN THERE'S CONSTRAINTS ON WHAT YOU SHOULD REGARD AS A VALUE BUT YOU BUT WITHIN THOSE CONSTRAINTS YOU HAVE THE
YOU1000000125_S0000096	CHOICE YOU HAVE CHOICE WELL THE THING IS IS THAT PEOPLE WILL CARRY A HEAVY LOAD IF THEY GET TO PICK THE GOD DAMNE LOAD
YOU1000000125_S0000098	SO AND THEY THINK WELL I WON'T CARRY ANY LOAD IT'S LIKE OKAY FINE BUT THEN YOU'RE LIKE THE SLED DOG THAT DOESN'T HAVE A SLED TO PULL YOU'RE JUST GOIN TA
YOU1000000125_S0000099	YOU'RE GONTO TEAR PIECES OUT OF YOUR OWN LEGS BECAUSE YOU'RE BORED YOU KNOW YOU NEED PEOPLE ARE PACK ANIMALS THEY NEED THEY NEED TO PULL AGAINST A WEIGHT
YOU1000000125_S0000100	AND AND THAT'S NOT TRUE FOR EVERYONE IT'S NOT TRUE PARTICULARLY SAY FOR LOW CONSCIENTIOUS PEOPLE I MEAN MAYBE THEY'RE OPEN AND CREATIVE OR EXTRAVERTED IN SOME OTHER THING
YOU1000000125_S0000101	FOR THE FOR THE TYPICAL PERSON
YOU1000000125_S0000103	THEY THEY THEY'LL EAT THEMSELVES THEY'LL EAT THEMSELVES UP UNLESS THEY HAVE A LOAD THIS IS WHY THERE'S SUCH AN OPIOTE EPIDEMIC AMONG DISPOSSESSED WHITE MIDDLE AGED GUY
YOU1000000125_S0000104	WORE UNEPLOYED IN THE US IT'S LIKE THEY LOSE THEIR JOB THEY'RE DONE

YOU1000000126_S0000037	SO THIS HAS BEEN GROWING FOR A LONG TIME AND ALL OF YOU OUR COMMUNITY HAS BEEN LEARNING A FIGURING OUT HOW TO TEACH ONLINE
YOU1000000126_S0000039	
YOU1000000126_S0000041	D COVID IS ACCELERATING EVERYTHING
YOU1000000126_S0000043	WE'VE SEEN HOW MANY WORKERS ARE HIT BY COVID ESPECIALLY THE ONES WITH WITHOUT A DEGREE
YOU1000000126_S0000045	WE HAVE SEEN HOW MORE PEOPLE ARE TAKING ONLINE COURSES TO HELP DU SELF ISOLATION OR TO LEARN ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH
YOU1000000126_S0000047	COVED IS ALSO CREATING UNIQUE CHALLENGES TO INSTITUTIONS WASHINGTON POST NEW YORK TIMES REPORTED COLLEGE STUDENTS REBELLING AGAINST FULL TUITION AFTER CLASSES MOVE ONLINE
YOU1000000126_S0000048	AND I WAS GRATIFIED WHEN I HEARD AMATTHEW IN THE PANEL JUST NOW TALK ABOUT LOWER PRICING ANNOUNCING LOWER PRICING FOR THEI SUMMER SESSION
YOU1000000126_S0000049	SO MANY OF THE TRENDS THAT HAVE BEEN UNDERWAY ARE ACCELERATED BY COVID AND WE ALL KNOW THAT SOCIETY IS HURTING
YOU1000000126_S0000050	THE IMF ESTIMATES THAT THE WORLD WILL EXPERIENCE A WORST RECESSION SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION
YOU1000000126_S0000051	MOST OF US MANY OF US THAT LIVED THROUGH THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS OF TWO THOUSAND NINE WHERE THE GLOBAL ECONOMY SRUNK BY POINT ONE PERCENT
YOU1000000126_S0000052	THIS TIME ROUND IT WILL SHRINK MUCH MORE BY IMF ESTIMATES AND JUST IN THE US ALONE TWENTY TWO MILLION UNEMPLOYED IN A MATTER OF WEEKS
YOU1000000126_S0000053	AND PEOPLE PEOPLE ARE HURTING
YOU1000000126_S0000055	WE HAVE A BIG ROLE TO PLAY TO HOP MANY OF THESE PEOPLE
YOU1000000126_S0000057	
YOU1000000126_S0000059	COMPOUNDING TREND ON TREND TRUST IN EXPERTISE AND TRUST IN INSTITUTIONS HAS ALSO BEEN GOING DOWN NOT JUST FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS BUT BUT FOR MANY YEARS NOW
YOU1000000126_S0000060	ADERMAN CARRIES OUT A LARGE ANNUAL VERY LARGE MULTICITY SURVEY CALLED THE ADERMAN TRUST BAROMETER
YOU1000000126_S0000061	AND IN ONE OF THE RECENT STUDIES THEY PLOT
YOU1000000126_S0000064	DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONS ACCORDING TO HOW COMPETENT THEY ARE VIEWED AND HOW ETHICAL THEY ARE
YOU1000000126_S0000065	HORIZONTAL AXES IS HOW COMPETENT IS AN INSTITUTION VERTICAL AXES IS HOW ETHICAL IS AN INSTITUTION
YOU1000000126_S0000066	AND BUSINESSES ARE VIEWED AS QUITE COMPETENT BUT NOT ALWAYS THE MOST ETHICAL ON AVERAGE
YOU1000000126_S0000067	NGOS NON GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS ARE VIEWED AS RELATIVELY ETHICAL BUT NOT AS COMPETENT
YOU1000000126_S0000068	AND GOVERNMENT MEDIA ARE PERCEIVED BY CITIZENS ALL AROUND THE WORLD AS NEITHER NECESSARY COMPETENT NOR ETHICAL
YOU1000000126_S0000069	I'M NOT SAYING THAT ANY OF THESE PERCEPTIONS ARE FAIR I THINK THERE ARE PLENTY OF HIGHLY COMPETENT AND HIGHLY ETHICAL INDIVIDUALS IN ALL OF THESE INSTITUTIONS
YOU1000000126_S0000070	BUT THIS IS THE PERCEPTION OF A LARGE SWATH OF SOCIETY AND WE HAVE A LACK OF INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE BROADLY PERCEIVED U
YOU1000000126_S0000071	FAIRLY OR UNFAIRLY W LACK OF INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE BROADLY PERCEIVED AS BOTH HIGHLY COMPETENT AND HIGHLY ETHICAL
YOU1000000126_S0000072	I WOULD QUITE LIKE FOR OUR INSTITUTIONS OF EDUCATION OUR INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION TO BEABLE TO PLAY THAT ROLE
YOU1000000126_S0000073	THIS TRUST PARATER DID NOT HAVE A NOTE SPECIFICALLY ON HIGHER EDUCATION BUT WE'VE ALL SEEN THE TRENDS AAS EDUCATORS FOR FOR FOR MANY YEARS
YOU1000000126_S0000075	AD SO MAYBE IT'S NO SURPRISE THEREFORE THAT WITH THE RISE OF COVID WITH ALL OF THESE IMPACTS HIGHER EDUCATION IS IN CRISIS
YOU1000000126_S0000076	YOU'VE SEEN JUST IN THE LAST FEW RECENT PERID OF THF TIME ARTICLES WITH TITLES LIKE CRISIS N HIGHER EDUCATION OR IN MY HOME STATE OF CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA'S HIGHER EDUCATION CRISIS
YOU1000000126_S0000077	FRENDS OF HIGR AMERICAN HIGER EDUCATION AND SO ON ON AND ON AND ON WE'RE SEEING ARTICLES LIKE THESE
YOU1000000126_S0000078	END DID I SAY THAT THIS WAS A SE CREATED BY THE COVID CRISIS ACTUALLY THESE ARTICLES WERE PUBLISHED WELL BEFORE THE COVID CRISIS
YOU1000000126_S0000079	SO IT'S TRANGE AND INTERESTING THAT THE FIELD OF HIGHER EDUCATION HAS BEEN IN CRISIS FOR ABOUT A DECADE NOW
YOU1000000126_S0000080	I THINK COVID IS ACCELERATING THIS CRISIS BUT IF WE WERE ALREADY IN THIS STATE EVEN BEFORE THE RECENT PANDEMIC
YOU1000000126_S0000081	I THINK THIS IS EVEN MORE RUE NOW YOU KNOW THERE THERE IS MI'M PROUD TO BE AN EDUCATOR EXCITEDFOL DISCIPLINE VERY COMMITTED TO EDUCATION
YOU1000000126_S0000082	BUT I WOULD QUITE LIKE TO DO SOMETHING SO THAT MAYBE BY THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE MAYBE WE ALL WORK REALLY HARD FOR A FEW YEARS AND AND NOT BE IN CRISES
YOU1000000126_S0000083	ANYMORE A FEW YEARS FROM NOW TOES SEEM LIKE THE HEALTHIEST STATE FOR OUR INDUSTRY TO BE IN TO HAVEEE IN CRICES FOR SO LONG
YOU1000000126_S0000084	UBUT TO ME I THINK THIS POPULAR REFLECTION OF OF THE STATE OF CRISIS IS IS MAYBE A SIGN THAT
YOU1000000126_S0000085	DESPITE ALL THE VERY POSITIVE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WE HAVE AND THAT WE'RE STRIVING TO TO MAKE THAT TERE'S A POTENTIAL FOR US TO DO EVEN BETTER
YOU1000000126_S0000087	ONE OF THE DOCUMENTS THAT MOVE ME THE MOST IS THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS
YOU1000000126_S0000088	I HAD FIRST READ THIS DOCUMENT WHEN I WAS A YOUNG ASSISTANT PROFESSOR AT STANFORD AND IT REALLY MOVED ME THE FIRST TIME I READ THIS
YOU1000000126_S0000089	BUT QUOTING FROM ARTICLE TWENTY SIX IT SAYS WE WE WE AS A SOCIETY DECLARED IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT
YOU1000000126_S0000090	THAT WAS THE YEAR MY FATHER WAS BORN SEVENTY TWO YEARS AGO
YOU1000000126_S0000091	WE SOCIETY DECIDED THAT EVERYONE HAS A RIGHT TO EDUCATION
YOU1000000126_S0000092	UEDUCATION SOULD BE FREE AT LEAST IN EMENTION FUNDAMENTAL STAGES TECHAND PROFESSIONAL EDUCATOSO MA GENERAY AVAILABLE
YOU1000000126_S0000093	AND HIGHER EDUCATION SHALL BE EQUALLY ACCESSIBLE TO ALL ON THE BASIS OF MERIT
YOU1000000126_S0000094	SADLY DESPITE THIS PROUD DECLARATION THIS BEAUTIFUL DECLARATION THAT WE MADE AS A SOCIETY SEVENTY TWO YEARS AGO
YOU1000000126_S0000095	THIS STILL ISN'T THE REALITY WE LIVE IN TODAY
YOU1000000126_S0000096	AND EDUCATION IS LIMITED BY GEOGRAPHY BY SOCIA ECONOMIC LIMITATIONS BY POLITICAL RESTRICTIONS
YOU1000000126_S0000097	VHISA RESTRICTIONS HAVE ALREADY BEEN MAKING IT HARD FOR STUDENTS TO GET IN EDUCATION AND IT'S BECOME EVEN HARDER JUST IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS
YOU1000000126_S0000098	JUST LAST NIGHT THE UNITED STATES PRESIDENT TWEETED OUT ABOUT SUSPENDING IMMIGRATION TO UNITED STATES
YOU1000000126_S0000099	AND I HAVE NO IDEA HOW THIS WILL AFFECT MANY OF OUR STUDENTS THAT HAVE BEEN OR ARE COUNTING ON MAYBE COMING TO THE UNITED STATES

YOU1000000126_S0000103	I THINK IT'S UP TO ALL OF US TO USE THE DIGITAL RELM TO MAKE SURE THAT EDUCATION BECOMES MORE RATHER THAN LESS ACCESSIBLE
YOU1000000126_S0000105	NOW AMIDST ALL OF THIS DOOM AND GLOOM AMIDS ALL OF THESE CHALLENGES WE FACE THERE IS A MASSIVE SILVER LINING
YOU1000000126_S0000106	I THINK SILVER LINING IS THAT THE'S GROWING ACCEPTANCE OF THE VIRTUAL WORLD OF ONLINE EDUCATION
YOU1000000126_S0000107	AND WE'RE ALSO REALLY LUCKY THAT WE WORK IN AN INDUSTRY SECTOR THAT IN EDUCATION A LOT OF OUR WORK CAN MOVE ONL I
YOU1000000126_S0000108	NOT ALL OF IT NOT EASILY BUT A LOT OF OUR WORK CAN MOVE ONLINE
YOU1000000126_S0000109	SO AS AN EDUCATOR I FEEL A SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR US TO LEAD THIS CHANGE AND TO PLAY THE ROLE THAT ALL OF US
YOU1000000126_S0000111	THAT ALL OF YOU CAN PLAY TO HELP THE REST OF SOCIETY
YOU1000000126_S0000113	AND PART OF THE SILVER LINING IS THAT EVEN WITH EVERYTHING GOING ON AROUND THE WORLD
YOU1000000126_S0000114	I SEE THAT PEOPLE WANT TO FEEL EMPOWERED DESPITE THE UNEMPLOYMENT DESPITE THE UNCERTAINTY AROUND THE WORLD
YOU1000000126_S0000115	PEOPLE WAKE UP IN THE MORNING WANTING TO HAVE PRODUCTIVE QUARANTINE MORNINGS AND AFTERNOONS AND EVENINGS AND
YOU1000000126_S0000117	JEFF SHOWED THIS PICTURE OF A RAPID RISE IN NEW USER ENROLLMENTS AND THIS IS NOT A SHORT TERM TREND THATILL BE OVER WHEN COVID DIES DOWN
YOU1000000126_S0000118	THIS GROWTH IN ONLINE EDUCATION HAS BEEN A LONG TERM TREND BUT ONLY ACCELERATED BY COVID
YOU1000000126_S0000119	AND YOU KNOW WHAT WITH THESE MILLIONS OF LEARNERS ALL AROUND THE WORLD LEARNING NEW HABITS THEY'RE TEACHING THEMSELVES HOW TO LEARN ONLINE
YOU1000000126_S0000120	I FEEL LIKE AS A AS AN INSTRUCTOR I'VE BEEN TEACHING MY STANFED CLASSES ONLINE VI ZOOM

YOU1000000126_S0000123	WEN WHEN SOCIAL DISTANCING CAN BE RELAXED
YOU1000000126_S0000124	THE SKILLS THAT THESE MILLIONS OR TENS OF MILLIONS O HUNDREDS OF MILLONS OF ONLINE LEARNERS ARE LEARNING RIGHT NOW THEY WON'T FORGET THESE SKILLS
YOU1000000126_S0000125	AND THIS CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO KEEP ON USING THE DIGITAL MEDIUM TO KEEP ON SERVING THEM EVEN AFTER COVIRD IS OVER
YOU1000000126_S0000127	I LIKE THIS QUOTE BY ONE OF THE PARTNERS AT IDIO WHO SAID THAT THE VIRUS SEEMS LIKE AN ACCELERATOF DIGITAL CHANGE THAT AS ALREADY UNDERWAY
YOU1000000126_S0000128	AND THAT THIS DIGITAL MINDSET WILL PERSIST AND IT'S HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT COMPANIES ALRL UNIVERSITIES OR STUDENTS WILL TRY TO RETURN TO WHAT WORKED PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC
YOU1000000126_S0000129	PATRICK BROTHERS DURING THE PANEL ALSO SAID THAT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN WHAT WE PREV PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT MIGHT HAPPEN OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS
YOU1000000126_S0000130	WILL NOW MAYBE HAPPEN OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS
YOU1000000126_S0000131	AND MIDS ALL THIS CHANGE I FEEL LIKE DIGITAL PEDAGOGY IS STILL IN ITS INFANCY

YOU1000000126_S0000153	YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF SOCIAL DISTANCING SHELTER IN PLACE THE WORLD DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH JIXOL PUZZLES AND YOU KNOW MAKING NEW JIXSOL PUZZLES IS REALLY HARD IT'S REALLY COMPLICATED
YOU1000000126_S0000154	BUT THE NICE THING ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO TEACHING ONLINE IS
YOU1000000126_S0000155	IF IF IF WE HADE DIGITAL JICITAL PUZZLES THE SOFTWARE APPS FO DIGITAL PUZZLES THAT CAN BE REPLICATED AT SCALE VERY QUICKLY SO
YOU1000000126_S0000156	DIGITAL INNOVATION IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT AS WE INNOVATE AS WE COME UP NEW FORMS OF PETOGOGY OUR COMMUNITY ALL OF YOU THE TEACHERS REPRESENTED HERE
YOU1000000126_S0000157	WE CAN QUICKLY TAKE THOSE IDEAS AND REPLICATE THAT TO LEARNNESS ALL AROUND THE WORLD BECAUSE THE DIGITAL MEDIUM IS EASY TO SCALE

YOU1000000127_S0000001	HEAT AND DROUGHT
YOU1000000127_S0000003	RAINFALL THAT'S GROWN UNPREDICTABLE
YOU1000000127_S0000005	STORMS OF CATASTROPHIC POWER
YOU1000000127_S0000007	AND RISING SEA LEVELS
YOU1000000127_S0000009	PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON HUMANITY
YOU1000000127_S0000011	AGREEMENT EMPHASIZES THAT CLIMATE CHANGE REPRESENTS AN EURGENT AND POTENTIALLY IRREVERSIBLE THREAT TO HUMAN SOCIETIES AND THE PLANET
YOU1000000127_S0000013	AND ACCORDING TO THE REPORT OF THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE AFRICA IS THE CONTINENT THAT WILL BE MOST AFFECTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE
YOU1000000127_S0000014	YOU MAY KNOW THAT THE DATA WE HAVE EIGHT POINT NINE MILLION IDPS
YOU1000000127_S0000015	AND THREE POINT NINE MILLION REFUGEES IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WITHOUT FULLY COUNTING TWO THOUSAND TWENTY WHICH IS A VERY DIFFICULT YEAR
YOU1000000127_S0000016	THAT WE HAVE CHALLENG AS HUMANITY THAT THAT DEFINITELY THE IMPACT OF COVID HAVE IN ALL POLITICAL ECONOMIC AND IN OUR SOCIAL ASPECTS
YOU1000000127_S0000017	CLIMATE CHANGE IS HITTING AFRICA HARDEST OF ALL ALTHOUGH THE CONTINENT HAS CONTRIBUTED LEAST TO THE CRISIS
YOU1000000127_S0000019	CROPS ARE ROTTING IN FIELDS
YOU1000000127_S0000021	HERDERS CAN NO LONGER FIND WATER FOR THEIR ANIMALS
YOU1000000127_S0000023	THE COVED NINETEEN PANDEMIC COULD SOON DRIVE ANOTHER FORTY MILLION PEOPLE IN SUBSAHARAN AFRICA INTO EXTREME POVERTY
YOU1000000127_S0000025	PEOPLE'S BECOMING HOMELESS FROM THE EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS AND THE CONFLICT AMONG THE COMMUNITIES START SO THAT'S THE ONE WHOL LEAD TO THE MIGRATIONS
YOU1000000127_S0000026	WE ARE TALKING MAYBE TO THE INTERNATIONAL MIGRATIONS WHERE THERE ARE NUMBERS OF THE PEOPLES KILLING THEMSELVES INTO MEDITERRANEANS TO JOIN THE EUROPE
YOU1000000127_S0000027	BUT THEYE ARE HUGE NUMBERS OF THE PEOPLES WHO ARE INTERNAL DISPLACED YEAH WHO HAVE TO MOVE FROM ONE REGION TO ANOTHER ONE
YOU1000000127_S0000028	AND THAT CREATES THE CONFLICT AMONG THOSE COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE TO CHARE THE RESOURCES
YOU1000000127_S0000029	HOW CAN WE PROTECT AND SUPPORT THOSE WHO ARE DISPLACED
YOU1000000127_S0000031	WHAT THE MODEL DOES IS THAT IT HAS NOW MUCH MORE GRANULAR DATA ON POPULATION EXPOSURE WHICH GIVES A CLEARER SENSE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKELY TO BETO BE DISPLACED BY FUTURE RIVERINE FLOODS
YOU1000000127_S0000032	AND IT ESTIMATES THAT ON AVERAGE WE CAN EXPECT TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE TO BE DISPLACED BY SUCH FLOODS IN AFRICA DURING ANY GIVEN YEAR IN THE FUTURE
YOU1000000127_S0000033	THE ARCTIC TEMPERATURE IS MORE THAN SEVEN DEGREES HIGHER THAN IT WAS ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO
YOU1000000127_S0000034	THIS HAS VAST IMPLICATIONS FOR EXAMPLE FLUTES TROPICAL STORMS DRODS AROUND THE WORLD
YOU1000000127_S0000035	THIS SHOWS CLIMATE CHANGE IS FAR MORE THAN AN ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE
YOU1000000127_S0000036	IT HAS CRUCIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR THE ECONOMY FOR PEACE AND STABILITY FOR SECURITY AND MIGRATION POLICY
YOU1000000127_S0000037	IT HAS THEREFORE BECOME ONE OF THE DETERMINING FACTORS OF FOREIGN POLICY AT LARGE
YOU1000000127_S0000038	THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL NOT LAST IN AFRICA
YOU1000000127_S0000039	WE'RE ALSO DEALING WITH THE PROBLEM OF CLIMATE APARTHEDE RIGHT NOW SO IN THE SENSE THAT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE PAYING THE FIRST AND MOST BRUTAL PRICE
YOU1000000127_S0000040	LOOK IN A PARTICULAR COLUR NTHOSE THAT HISTORICALLY CARRY THE BIGGEST WEIGHT OF THE SO S SO
YOU1000000127_S0000041	WE OFTEN WONDER WHETHER IN FACT THE URGENCY WOULD BE MUCH MORE IF THERE WERE MORE URGENT
YOU1000000127_S0000042	IMMEDIATE IMPACTS HAPPENING IN EUROPE AND SO ON
YOU1000000127_S0000043	NOW THAT'S A VERY NEGATIVE STATEMENT TO START WITH BUT LET ME JUST TELL YOU HY I'M
YOU1000000127_S0000044	BASICALLY THIS IS NO TIME FOR US TO BE BEING
YOU1000000127_S0000045	PALLY PALLY WITH EACH OTHER AND NOT TALKING ABOUT THE CONTRADICTIONS THAT EXIST AND NOT ACTUALLY GETTING
YOU1000000127_S0000046	ABSOLUTELY SERIOUS ABOUT SPEAKING TRUTH TO POWER WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME
YOU1000000127_S0000047	DEVEOPMENT IS BEING UNDERMINED BY CLIMATE CHANGE AND WE CANNOT IGNORE IT AND WE MUST ADDRESS IT AND WE MUST ADDRESS IT UPFRONT
YOU1000000127_S0000048	I REALLY THINK THAT WE HAVE ALSO TO STOP SEEING MIGRATION JUST NEGATIVELY
YOU1000000127_S0000049	AND THIS IS A KEY MESSAGE FROM MY SIDE I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK ALSO AT MIGRATION AS A PART OF THE SOLUTION
YOU1000000127_S0000050	MOST OF THE TIME WE TALK BASICALLY ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE AS THE CAUSE FOR MIGRATION AND WE FRAME IT AS A PROBLEM
YOU1000000127_S0000051	AND WE RARELY LOOK AT THIS AS AAS AN OPPORTUNITY AS AN ADAPTATION STRATEGY
YOU1000000127_S0000052	THE EUROPEAN IN AFRICA IS AN EXPAT AND THE AFRICAN IN EUROPE IS A MIGRANT IT CAN'T CONTINUE LIKE
YOU1000000127_S0000054	AUTHORITIES IN FREETOWN HAVE NOW DETERMINED TO PLANT A MILLION TREES BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO
YOU1000000127_S0000056	AND INCREASE VEGETATION IN THE CITY BY FIFTY PERCENT
YOU1000000127_S0000058	THAT WILL NOT ONLY HELP PROTECT RESIDENTS IN THE FUTURE BUT ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE
YOU1000000127_S0000060	IN ADDITION TO THIS COMMITMENTS AND FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF AFRICA THERE'S NEED
YOU1000000127_S0000062	FOCUS ON BUILDING RESILIENT SOCIETIES IN WHICH PEOPLE CAN ADAPT IN PLACE AND PROSPER
YOU1000000127_S0000063	SO THAT THER ISN'T NEED FOR CONTINUOUS MIGRATION IN THIS REGARD
YOU1000000127_S0000064	ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT REMAINS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY TO ADAPT TO CLIMATE CHANGE
YOU1000000127_S0000065	YOU CANNOT HAVE CLIMATE RESILIENCE WITHOUT ECONOMIC GROWTH WEALTH CREATION AND MASSIE JOB EXPANSION
YOU1000000127_S0000066	AND ENERGY OF COURSE IS TIED TO EVERYTHING YOU NEED ENERGY FOR THE CLEAN WATER AND SANITATION IN CITIES
YOU1000000127_S0000067	YOU NEED ENERGY FOR THE LIGHTING TO DRIVE THE INDUSTRIES THAT WILL CREATE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AND GROWTH
YOU1000000127_S0000069	SO YOU BEGIN TO SEE THAT NEXSUS BETWEEN ENERGY WATER AND SANITATION ENERGY AND HEALTH SERVICE DELIVERY
YOU1000000127_S0000070	THERE IS A REAL NEED FOR URBAN PLANNING URBAN POLICY WHICH IS ALIGNED TO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
YOU1000000127_S0000071	ND AND HOUSING STOCK RECOGNIZING THIS PHENOMENON OF URBANIZATION IS HERE TO STAY
YOU1000000127_S0000072	IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE AN INFLUX OF PEOPLE YOU NEED TO PLAN TO RECEIVE THEM YOU NEED TO PLAN TO DELIVER SERVICES
YOU1000000127_S0000073	I THINK THE CONTINENT NEEDS TO CLARIFY TO HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING ON WHERE IT WANTS TO GO WHAT IT NEEDS AND IT HAWS TO DO
YOU1000000127_S0000074	IT HAS TO BE NOT ONLY A TOP DOWN APPROACH BUT ALSO A BUTTOM UP APPROACH FULLY INFORMED BY THOSE
YOU1000000127_S0000075	SHOULD EUROPE TURN INTO EVEN MORE OF A FORTRESS
YOU1000000127_S0000077	OR SHOULD IT INSTEAD LOOK FOR MORE WAYS TO MAKE LEGAL MIGRATION FROM AFRICA POSSIBLE
YOU1000000127_S0000079	CLIMATE CHANGE IS A COMMON THREAT TO ALL OF US NO COUNTRY CAN WITHDRAW FROM THE EFFECTS OF GLOBAL WARMING
YOU1000000127_S0000080	PEOPLE LOSE THEIR ENTIRE EXISTENCE BECAUSE OF DISASTERS THE POLITICAL STABILITY OF WHOLE REGIONS IS AT STAKE
YOU1000000127_S0000081	TO WORK TOGETHER TO EASE THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE IS THEREFORE A QUESTION OF HUMANITY BUT ALSO OF POLITICAL RATIONALITY
YOU1000000127_S0000082	THIS STRATEGY IS ABOUT THE EU AND AFRICA JOINING FORCES IN A SOLID EQUAL PARTNERSHIP
YOU1000000127_S0000083	TO MAKE THE MOST OF THE GREEN AND THE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION
YOU1000000127_S0000085	TOGETHER WE CAN CREATE DECENT JOBS GOOD LIVELIHOODS WHILE ALSO TACKLING CLIMATE CHANGE
YOU1000000127_S0000086	CAN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY COME TOGETHER TO FACE THE IMMENSE CHALLENGES AHEAD
YOU1000000127_S0000088	THE U N TO REMAIN CREDIBLE THE SECURITY COUNCIL NEEDS TO CHANGE THE COMPOSITION OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL
YOU1000000127_S0000089	ACTUALLY REFLECT THE REALITIES AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR BUT IT DOESN'T REFLECT THE REALITY OF TODAY
YOU1000000127_S0000090	WE HAVE TO WORK NOT EUROCENTRIC BUT WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER WITH LIKEMINDED COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE TO SEE TO I T
YOU1000000127_S0000091	THAT THE RULES BASED INTERNATIONAL ORDER IS OBSERVED THIS CANNOT BE JUST DOE BY DONE BY ONE COUNTRY BY ONE PERSON
YOU1000000127_S0000092	NEVER LET A CRISIS GO TO WASTE AD THERE IS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ON WHERE WE CAN SEE HOW TO INDEED BETWEEN EUROPE AND AFRICA WORK TOGETHER
YOU1000000127_S0000093	TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES BY SHARING BEST PRACTICES BY SHARING EXPERIENCES AND BY LOOKING AT POTENTIAL PROSPECT
YOU1000000127_S0000094	I THINK THAT GERMANY HAS TO DO MORE THIS IS EXACTLY MY EXPECTATION
YOU1000000127_S0000095	AND I'M CONVINCED THAT CLIMATE INDUCED MIGRATION IS AN ISSUE THAT URGENTLY NEEDS OPEN DIALOGUE
YOU1000000127_S0000096	BETWEEN COUNTRIES AND MULTILATERAL PLATFORMS TO CREATE SAFE PATHWAYS FOR MIGRATION
YOU1000000127_S0000097	TO CREATE A STATUS THAT PROTECTS THOSE WHO ARE LIKELY TO BECOME STATELESS
YOU1000000127_S0000098	THE ONLY FAILURE IS TO GIVE UP IT'S DOABLE WE CAN DO IT IT WAS DONE BEFORE
YOU1000000127_S0000099	THE THE ETHE KEY HERE IS TO DO IT DIFFERENTLY TO DO IT WITHWITH WITH WITH CREATIVITY AND TO ENSURE THE NEEDED COMMITMENT
YOU1000000127_S0000100	IT'S IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE AND WE SHOULD PUT BACK PEOPLE THE AT THE HEART OF THE CLIMATE ACTION
YOU1000000127_S0000101	WHEN IT COMES TO THE CONTINENT A MOBILE CONTINENT IS A HEALTHY CONTINENT EAH
YOU1000000127_S0000102	ENIT COMES TO WHEN IT COMES TO MOBILITY A MOBILE CONTINENT IS A RESOURCEFUL CONTINENT
YOU1000000127_S0000103	WE ALWAYS SAY NATURE IS EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE NATURE IS THE ONE WHOARE GIVING US FOOD GIVING US MEDICINE EVEN THE MEDICINE IN THE PHARMACY
YOU1000000127_S0000104	SEVENTY PERCENT OF IT COMING FROM THE NATURE AND THEN MAYBE THIRTY PERCENT THAT FROM THE CHEMICAL
YOU1000000127_S0000105	THINGS THAT THEY ARE ADDING ON NE BUT THE ESPIRATIONS AND ALL THE SUBSTANCE ARE COMING FROM NATURE
YOU1000000127_S0000107	AND FOOD ARE COMING FROM NATURE WE HAVE A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY FROM NOW TO THE NEXT NINE YEARS OR TEN YEARS
YOU1000000127_S0000108	TO INCREASE ALL THE AMBITIONS AND ACT NOW IF WE DIDN'T DO THAT WE ARE GOING TO DO THIS NO TURN POINT
YOU1000000127_S0000110	IT'S TIME TO ACT
YOU1000000128_S0000003	GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYBODY IT IS LOVELY TO BE BACK MY NAME IS MABEL VONORANYA AND AS YOU MIGHT KNOW I'M A FORMER CO CHAIR OF E CFR AND I AM CURRENTLY A CHAIR IMERITAS
YOU1000000128_S0000004	AND I'M REALLY REALLY EXCITED TO FACILITATE THIS CONVERSATION WITH GEORGE SORROS WHO AS YOU ALL KNOW IS THE MAN WHWHO PLAYED A ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL ROLE IN THE CREATION OF ECFR
YOU1000000128_S0000005	AND BEFORE I HAND THE FLOOR TO HIM I WANTED TO JUST MAYBE DRAW ATTENTION TO ONE OR TWO OF THE FEATURES THAT I FIND SO AMAZING OF GEORGE
YOU1000000128_S0000006	BECAUSE GEORGE IS SOMEBODY WHO IS ALWAYS AHEAD OF THE CURVE HE OFTEN SEES THINGS LONG BEFORE THE GENERAL PUBLIC ACTUALLY REALLIZES THAT THEY'RE HAPPENING
YOU1000000128_S0000007	AND I AM THINKING FOR EXAMPLE ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE RECOGNIZED THE ECONOMIC CRISIS OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HE SAW IT COMING BEFORE IT EVEN HIT
YOU1000000128_S0000008	BUT ALSO I'M THINKING ABOUT AN ISSUE THAT HAS REALLY BEEN CLOSE TO HIS HEART FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS NOW I THINK WHICH IS CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM IN THE UNITED STATES
YOU1000000128_S0000009	HE'S BEEN WORKING ON TWENTY FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS ON THIS AND IT IS REALLY GOOD TO SEE THAT THAT THAT IS FINALLY GETTING MUCH MORE ATTENTION AS IT REALLY DESERVES
YOU1000000128_S0000011	GET US CLOSER TO HOME LET US GET US TO EUROPE AND ONE OF THESE THINGS THAT I'VE SEEN GEORGE DO TIME AND TIME AGAIN IN EUROPE IS SOMETHING THAT ALSSO REALLY CHARACTORE AND THAT IS STANDING UP FOR THE UNDERDOG
YOU1000000128_S0000012	AND I SAW HIM FIRST DO THAT IN THE EARLY NINETY S WHEN WE WERE WORKING ON THE WAR IN THE BALKANS BUT I'VE SEEN HIM DO THAT ALSO FOR EXAMPLE IN THE CASE OF THE ROMA
YOU1000000128_S0000013	AND OTHER MINORITIES ALL OVER OVER EUROPE REFUGEES ETCTERA SO WITH A MAN WHO'S ALWAYS WILLING TO PICK A GOOD FIGHT TO STAND UP FOR WHAT IS RIGHT AND TO SEE AHEAD
YOU1000000128_S0000014	AHEAD FAR SOONER THAN THAN MANY OF US CAN SEE I'M REALLY REALLY KEEN TO HEAR FROM HIM WHAT IS ON HIS MIND AND WHERE HE THINKS
YOU1000000128_S0000015	WE SHOULD ALL BE GOING GEORGE LET ME GIVE YOU THE FLOOR THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US
YOU1000000128_S0000017	THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYBODY
YOU1000000128_S0000019	WE LIVE IN A REVOLUTIONA MO IN HISTORY AT TIMES LIKE THESE THE RANGE OF POSSIBILITIES IS FAR GREATER THAN IN NORMAL TIMES
YOU1000000128_S0000021	EVENTS THAT ARE INCONCEIVABLE IN NORMAL TIMES NOT ONLY BECOME POSSIBLE BUT ACTUALLY HAPPEN
YOU1000000128_S0000023	I HAVE DEVELOPED AN ENTIRE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK BASED ON THE TWIN PILLARS OF FALIBILITY AND REFLEXIVITY
YOU1000000128_S0000024	TO DEAL WITH SITUATIONS LIKE THE PRESENT
YOU1000000128_S0000026	THAT'S WHAT HAS ALLOWED ME TO MAKE A FORTUNE IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS
YOU1000000128_S0000028	IN THE VERY FIRST DAYS OF JANUARY OF THIS YEAR I REALIZED THAT WE HAD ENTERED A GLOBAL CRISIS THAT WOULD CHANGE THE DIRECTION OF HISTORY
YOU1000000128_S0000030	THAT'S WHEN IRANIAN GENERAL SALAMANI WAS ASSASSINATED IN IRAQE
YOU1000000128_S0000032	THAT TOLD ME
YOU1000000128_S0000033	THAT COUNTRIES WERE MORE INTERESTED IN FIGHTING EACH OTHER THAN IN FIGHTING CLIMATE CHANGE
YOU1000000128_S0000035	AS YOU KNOW CLIMATE CHANGE IS A GLOBAL PROBLEM AND IT REQUIRES GLOBAL COOPERATION TO BRING IT UNDER CONTROL
YOU1000000128_S0000037	THEN CAME THE NOVE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS THAT THORRALY DISRUPTED PEOPLE'S LIVES AND ADDED YET ANOTHER GLOBAL PROBLEM
YOU1000000128_S0000039	WHAT DIRECTION WILL HISTORY TAKE
YOU1000000128_S0000041	THAT'S A QUESTION NOBODY CAN ANSWER BECAUSE THE FUTURE DEPENDS ON DECISIONS THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN TAKEN
YOU1000000128_S0000043	NEVERTHELESS I BELIEVE MY OPEN SOCIETY FOUNDATIONS ARE WELL SITUATED TO DEVELOP STRATEGIES TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE
YOU1000000128_S0000045	I PERSONALLY HAVE FOCUSED ON AREAS WHERE I HAVE EXPERIENCE AND A HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
YOU1000000128_S0000047	THAT LED ME TO TWO PARTICULAR ISSUES THAT ARE OF GLOBAL SIGNIFICANCE
YOU1000000128_S0000049	ONE IS THE PLAN
YOU1000000128_S0000051	FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND TO ISSUE A NEW ROUND OF SPECIAL DRAWING RIGHTS
YOU1000000128_S0000053	AND TO PERSUADE RICH COUNTRIES TO DTO DONATE THEIR ALLOCATIONS WHICH THEY DON'T NEED TO POOR COUNTRIES THAT ARE DESPERATE FOR THEM
YOU1000000128_S0000055	TO EXPLAIN THE IDEA BETTER
YOU1000000128_S0000057	SPECIAL DRAWING RIGHTS ARE SYNTHETIC MONEY CREATED BY THE IMF
YOU1000000128_S0000059	SDRS ARE ALLOCATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MEMBER COUNTRIES SHAREHOLDING IN THE IMF
YOU1000000128_S0000061	RICH COUNTRIES DON'T NEED THEM BECAUSE THEY CAN RAISE ISSUE MONEY IN THEIR OWN NAME IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS
YOU1000000128_S0000063	THE CAPACITY OF FOUR COUNTRIES TO DO SO IS EXTREMELY LIMITED
YOU1000000128_S0000064	THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR RICH COUNTRIES TO DONATE THEIR ALLOCATIONS TO POOR ONES
YOU1000000128_S0000066	AS REGARDS HISTORICAL
YOU1000000128_S0000068	I AM NOT SURE IF WE HAVE A TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY WHETHER WE HAVE LOST GEORGE
YOU1000000128_S0000070	THE CONNECTION WITH GEORGE
YOU1000000128_S0000072	I'M AFRAID WE HAVE LOST THE CONNECTION WITH GEORGE SO HOPEFULLY HE WILL HE WILL SOON COME BACK IN AND RECONNECT
YOU1000000128_S0000074	O PLEASE BE PATIENT
YOU1000000128_S0000076	I'M SORRY AS I'M USING DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIY
YOU1000000128_S0000079	THERE YOU ARE GEORGE THERE YOU'RE YEAH GEORGE YOU'RE BACK WOU'RE RECONNECTED

YOU1000000128_S0000082	SO NEVERTHELESS
YOU1000000128_S0000084	THUSIASTILY ENDORSED THE IDEA AND ARGUED THAT THE BEST AND PERHAPS ONLY WAY TO RAISE ONE OR TWO TRILLION EUROS
YOU1000000128_S0000085	IS BY ISSUING PROFETIOAL BONDS
YOU1000000128_S0000087	E DISTINGUISHING FEATURE OF PERPETUAL BONDS IS THAT THE PRINCIPLE NEVER HAS TO BE REPAID ONLY THE ANNUAL INTEREST IS DUE
YOU1000000128_S0000089	THIS MAKES THEM VERY EFFICIENT
YOU1000000128_S0000091	THEY HAVE A COST BENEFIT RATIO THAT IS ALMOST TEN TIMES GREATER THAN THAT OF THE LONG TERM BONDS THAT THE COMMISSION IS PROPOSING TO USE
YOU1000000128_S0000093	THIS SOUNDS ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE BUT IT'S TRUE
YOU1000000128_S0000095	ASSUMING O POINT FIVE PERCENT INTEREST
YOU1000000128_S0000097	WHICH IS QUITE GENEROUS IN THE CURRENTLOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT
YOU1000000128_S0000099	ONE TRILLION EUROS WOULD COST ONLY FIVE BILLION ANNUALLY
YOU1000000128_S0000101	THE INTEREST WOULD HAVE TO BE FOREVE BE PAID FOREVER BUT THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE PAYMENTS DIMINISHES PROGRESSIVELY
YOU1000000128_S0000102	UNTIL IT APPROACHES BUT DOESN'T QUITE REACH ZERO
YOU1000000128_S0000104	MOST IMPORTANTLY PERPETUAL BONDS COULD BE ISSUED AS SOON AS MEMBER STATES AUTHORIZE SUFFICIENT OWN RESOURCES
YOU1000000128_S0000105	TO MAINTAIN THE TRIPLA RATING OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
YOU1000000128_S0000107	OWN RESOURCES WOULD COME FROM NEWLY AUTHORIZED TAXES SUCH AS A TAX ON CARBON EMISSIONS
YOU1000000128_S0000109	HE TAXES WOULD ONLY HAVE TO BE AUTHORIZED THEY WOULDN'T NEED TO BE IMPOSED
YOU1000000128_S0000110	BECAUSE THAT WOULD TAKE TOO LONG AND SPEED SPEED IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE
YOU1000000128_S0000112	THE PROFESSIONAL BONDS DON'T NEED TO BE ISSUED IN ONE GO THEY COULD BE SOLD IN TRANCHES
YOU1000000128_S0000114	HE FIRST TRANCHES WOULD BE SNATCHED UP BY INSURANCE COMPANIES AND OTHER LONG TERM INVESTORS
YOU1000000128_S0000115	WHO ARE STARVED OF ASSETS TO MATCH THEIR LIABILITIES
YOU1000000128_S0000117	AS THE MARKET FAMILIARIZE THEMSELVES WITH THE NEW INSTRUMENT OTHER INVESTORS WOULD BE ATTRACTED TO IT
YOU1000000128_S0000119	AND AS AS THE BOND BANET AS THE BONDS BECAME ACTIVELY ACTIVELY TRADED
YOU1000000128_S0000121	EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK WOULD ALSO BE ALLOWED TO INVEST IN THEM
YOU1000000128_S0000123	THERE IS AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION BETWEEN FUNDS RAISED FROM THE EU'S OWN RESOURCES AND THOSE THAT ARE CONTRIBUTED BY MEMBERSTATES
YOU1000000128_S0000125	THE LATTER HAVE TO BE DISTRIBUTED TO MEMBER STATES ACCORDING TO THEIR SHAREHOLDING IN THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK
YOU1000000128_S0000127	E FORMER CAN BE GIVEN BY THE COMMISSION TO THOSE WHOE MOST IN NEED
YOU1000000128_S0000129	THAT MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE AID THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION CAN PROVIDE
YOU1000000128_S0000130	FOR INSTANCE
YOU1000000128_S0000132	IT COULD ASSIST THOSE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR LIVELIHOOD BECAUSE OF THE VIRUS
YOU1000000128_S0000133	CURRENTLY THEY HAVE TO DEPEND ON THEIR OWN GOVERNMENTS WHOSE CAPACITIES VARY
YOU1000000128_S0000134	IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE EQUITABLE IF THE SUPPORT CAME FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION
YOU1000000128_S0000136	
YOU1000000128_S0000138	WHY DO MEMBER STATES IGNORE SO STUDIOUSLY AN INSTRUMENT THAT IS IDEALLY SUITED T E THE CURRENT SITUATION
YOU1000000128_S0000140	THEY WERE AWARE OF PERPETUAL BONDS BECAUSE SPAINE CHAMPIONED THEM AT A VIRTUAL SUMMIT OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL ON APRIL TWENTY THIRD
YOU1000000128_S0000141	AND THEY WERE LISTED AS ONE OF THE IDEAS THAT DESERVED FURTHER CONSIDERATION
YOU1000000128_S0000143	MY GUESS IS THAT THE PERFECTUAL BONDS WERE DISMISSED OUT OF HAND
YOU1000000128_S0000144	BECAUSE THEY WERE CONFUSED WITH CORONABONDS
YOU1000000128_S0000146	HE LETTER WERE DECISIVELY REJECTED BY MEMBER STATES BECAUSE SOME OF THEM WERE UNWILLING TO GO THAT FAR
YOU1000000128_S0000148	IN REALITY PERPETUAL BONDS ARE THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF CORONA BONDS
YOU1000000128_S0000150	PERPETUAL BONDS REDUCE THE DEBT BURDEN CORONA BONDS INCREASE IT
YOU1000000128_S0000152	TO AVOID CONFUSION AN NOW TRY TO AVOID USING THE TERM PERPETUAL BONS
YOU1000000128_S0000154	I PREFER TO USE THE WORD CONSOLES
YOU1000000128_S0000156	THAT'S THE NAME THE U K AND THE U S USED FOR CENTURIES TO DESERVE PERPETUAL TO DESCRIBE PERPETUAL BONBS
YOU1000000128_S0000158	UK STARTED IN SEVENTEEN FIFTY TWO AND THE U S IN EIGHTEEN IN THE EIGHTEEN SEVENTY S
YOU1000000128_S0000160	INTERESTINGLY THE NETHERLANDS
YOU1000000128_S0000162	PREDATED THE OTHER TWO COUNTRIES
YOU1000000128_S0000164	A DUTCH WATER BOARD ISSUED PERPETUAL BONDS IN SIXTEEN FORTY EIGHT
YOU1000000128_S0000165	TO REPAIR A DIKE
YOU1000000128_S0000167	THE BONS ARE STILL OUTSTANDING
YOU1000000128_S0000168	BUT THE ANNUAL INTEREST HAS BECOME SO SMALL THAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC IS NOT EVEN AWARE OF THEIR CONTINUED EXISTENCE
YOU1000000128_S0000170	AS FAR AS I KNOW THE DUTCH ACTUALLY INVENTED THE IDEA
YOU1000000128_S0000171	YET TODAY THEY ARE THE MOST ARDENT OPPONENT
YOU1000000128_S0000172	THEY ARE THE LEADERS OF THE SO CALLED FRUGAL FOR
YOU1000000128_S0000174	IN SIXTEEN FORTY EIGHT THE NETHERLANDS FACED A SERIOUS THREAT FROM FLOODING
YOU1000000128_S0000176	TODAY THE COMBINATION OF THE VIRUS AND CLIMATE CHANGE POSES AN EVEN GREATER DANGER TO THE EUROPEAN UNION
YOU1000000128_S0000178	IT WOULD BE TRAGIC IF EUROPE IN GENERAL AND THE FRUGL FOUR IN PARTICULAR FAIL TO GIVE CONSOLES THE CONSIDERATION THEY DESERVE
YOU1000000128_S0000180	I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE BOUND TO BE LEGAL OBJECTIONS
YOU1000000128_S0000181	BASED ON THE TFEU THAT CONTAINS ALL THE RULES THAT GOVERN THE EUROPEAN UNION
YOU1000000128_S0000183	I BELIEVE THE OBJECTIONS COULD BE OVERCOME
YOU1000000128_S0000184	BY ARGUING THAT THE AUTHORS OF THE TFU WERE NOT AWARE OF THE EXISTENCE OF CONSOLES
YOU1000000128_S0000185	THEREFORE IT'S REGULATIONS DOESN'T APPLY TO THEM
YOU1000000128_S0000187	I ALSO ANTICIPATE
YOU1000000128_S0000189	MORAL OBJECTIONS FROM GERMAN SPEAKING PEOPLE
YOU1000000128_S0000190	THE GERMAN WORD SHUD HAS A DOUBLE MEANING DEBT AND GUILT
YOU1000000128_S0000192	IT FOLLOWS THAT THAT DEBTS SHOULD BE THAT DEBTORS SHOULD BE PUNISHED
YOU1000000128_S0000194	THAT MAKES FOR FACTUAL BONDS THAT NEVER HAVE TO BE REPAID MORALLY INADMISSIBLE
YOU1000000128_S0000196	THERE IS ONE LEGITIMATE LEGITIMATE OBJECTION THAT MAYBE MAY RAISED
YOU1000000128_S0000198	ONCE YOU START USING CONSULES YOU MAY END UP ABUSING THEM
YOU1000000128_S0000200	BUT THE FACT THAT THE LARGE SCALE USE OF EUROPE'S TRIPLEA CREDIT IS ALREADY DESIGNATED AS A TEMPORARY MEASURE
YOU1000000128_S0000202	THAT SHOULD BE THEA THAT SU BE SURE
YOU1000000128_S0000203	THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE USED IN NORMAL TIMES
YOU1000000128_S0000205	THEYOFFER A FINANCIAL TOOL IDEALLY SUITED TO THE CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES
YOU1000000128_S0000207	THEY WOULD NOT BE ABUSED IN NORMAL SIRCMTIMES
YOU1000000128_S0000209	OWHY ALLTHIS HOSTILITY
YOU1000000128_S0000211	I BELIEVE THE NSWER IS TO BE FOUND IN THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS
YOU1000000128_S0000213	THE COMMISSION WAS NOT AWARE OF PERPETUAL BONDS WHEN IT PROPOSED A RECOVERY PLAN
YOU1000000128_S0000215	IT WAS RELYING ON THE ONLY INSTRUMENT OVER WHICH IT HAD SOME CONTROL NAMELY THE BUDGET
YOU1000000128_S0000217	THAT FOCUSED THE ATTENTION OF MEMBER STATES AND INTEREST GROUPS
YOU1000000128_S0000218	ON HOW THE FUNDS ARE DISTRIBUTED NOT ON HOW THEY WERE GENERATED
YOU1000000128_S0000220	INTERESTED PARTIES ARE NOW HAGGLING WITH EACH OTHER
YOU1000000128_S0000221	FOR INSTANCE THE FRUGL FOUR WANT TO PROTECT THETHEIR DISCOUNTS FROM THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE BUDGET
YOU1000000128_S0000223	IT WILL TAKE TIME FOR THE AUTHORITIES TO REALIZE THAT THE BUDGET CAN GENERATE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THE EUROPEAN UNION NEEDS
YOU1000000128_S0000225	THAT'S WHEN THE CONSOLES WILL BE RECOGNIZED
YOU1000000128_S0000226	AS AN INDISPENSABLE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT
YOU1000000128_S0000228	BUT BY THAT TIME IT MAY BE TOO LATE
YOU1000000128_S0000230	WE MUST THEREFORE ACCELERATE THE PROCESS
YOU1000000128_S0000232	HMONEY IS NEEDED NOW
YOU1000000128_S0000238	AND SHE HAS FULLY RECOVERED HER POLITICAL INFLUENCE
YOU1000000128_S0000240	SHE ALSO HAS CAPABLE SUPPORTERS IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE
YOU1000000128_S0000242	W UNDERSTAND THE MERITS OF CONSOLS
YOU1000000128_S0000244	IN ADDITION TO DEALINTO DEALING WITH THE VIRUS
YOU1000000128_S0000245	CONSOLE SHOULD ALSO BE USED TO ADDRESS GRAMMA CHANGE
YOU1000000128_S0000247	RECENTLY A STRONG MOVEMENT HAS DEVELOPED
YOU1000000128_S0000249	TO RAISE THE TWENTY THIRTY CLIMATE TARGET
YOU1000000128_S0000250	FROM FORTY PERCENT TO FIFTY FIVE PERCENT
YOU1000000128_S0000251	A NUMBER OF MAINLY EAST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE OBJECTING THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO MEET THE HIGHER TARGET
YOU1000000128_S0000253	THAT COULD BE READILY REMEDIED WITH AN ADDITIONAL TRILLION EUROS OF CONSOLES
YOU1000000128_S0000254	OF COURSE THE COMMISSION WOULD HAVE TO CAREFULLY MONITOR THAT THE FUNDS ARE NOT MISDIRECTED AND MISUSED
YOU1000000128_S0000256	IN THIS WAY THE EUROPEAN UNION COULD MEET THE TWO GREAT CHALLENGES OF OF OUR TIME
YOU1000000128_S0000257	AND FULFILL THE EXPECTATIONS OF ITS CITIZENS THAT WOULD BE A TRULY GREAT ACCOMPLISHMENT THANK YOU
YOU1000000129_S0000000	THERE ARE BUT A FEW MEN IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY WHO HAVE ACCUMULATED FORTUNES LIKE THAT OF ANDREW CARNEGI A MAN WHO WAS AS COMPLEX AS HE WAS RICH
YOU1000000129_S0000001	AFTER SELLING HIS COMPANY HIS NET WORTH WOULD EQUAL A STAGGERING TWO PERCENT OF AMERICA'S GDP
YOU1000000129_S0000002	IN TODAY'S VIDEO WE'LL EXPLORE HOW ONE SCOTTISH IMMIGRANT ARMED WITH JUST FIVE YEARS OF SCHOOLING WOULD RISE FROM POVERTY TO THE STATUS OF THE WORLD'S RICHEST MAN
YOU1000000129_S0000004	THIS VIDEO WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE IF IT WASN'T FOR OUR FRIENDS AT ACORNS AN INVESTMENT APP WITH OVER SIX MILLION USERS THAT MAKES INVESTING AS EASY AS SPENDING

YOU1000000129_S0000006	THAT'S FREE MONEY TO HELP YOU GET STARTED WITH INVESTING SO BE SURE TO CHECK THEM OUT THE LINK IS IN THE VIDEO DESCRIPTION BELOW
YOU1000000129_S0000008	CARNEGI WAS AT ONE POINT THE RICHEST AMERICAN IN HISTORY BUT HE WASN'T BORN IN AMERICA
YOU1000000129_S0000009	ANDREWS STORY BEGINS ACROSS THE ATLANTIC OCEAN IN DUNFIRMLINE SCOTLAND WHERE HE GREW UP IN WHAT COULD ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS ABJECT POVERTY
YOU1000000129_S0000010	HIS MOTHER WOULD WORK AROUND THE CLOCK SEWING SHOES HIS FATHER WOULD MAKE CLOTH AND OTHER MATERIAL HAND WEAVING LOOMS
YOU1000000129_S0000011	THAT WAS OF COURSE UNTIL THE STEAM POWERED LOOM CAME INTO THE PICTURE WITH WEAVING TECHNOLOGY RAPIDLY IMPROVING HIS FATHER'S LOOM BUSINESS WOULD CRUMBLE FINDING HIMSELF CRUSHED BY THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION
YOU1000000129_S0000012	WATCHING HIS FATHER SUFFER AS HE BEGGED FOR WORK WOULD IMPACT THE YOUNG CARNEGI PROFOUNDLY IN EIGHEN FORTY EIGHT THE CARNEGIS SET OUT IN SEARCH OF A BETTER LIFE OUTSIDE SCOTLAND AFTER SELLING ALL OF THEIR POSSESSIONS AND BORROWING TWENTY POUNDS
YOU1000000129_S0000013	THE FAMILY EMBARKED ON THEIR JOURNEY TO THE LAND OF OPPORTUNITY AMERICA THEY WOULD RESTART THEIR LIVES FROM SCRATCH IN PITSBURG THE HUB OF MANUFACTURING BUT STILL FOUND THEMSELVES UNABLE TO ESCAPE HARDSHIP IN THEIR NEW COUNTRY
YOU1000000129_S0000014	HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BOTH STRUGGLED TO FIND WORK LEAVING ANDREW NO CHOICE BUT TO DROP OUT OF SCHOOL TO SUPPORT HIS FAMILY HE WOULD FINALLY CATCH A BREAK FROM THE SCORCHING HEAT OF THE BOILER ROOMS WHEN HE LANDED A JOB AT A LOCAL TELEGRAPH OFFICE
YOU1000000129_S0000015	AS A MESSENGER BOY HE WOULD DELIVER TELEGRAMS BY BIKE ALL OVER PITSBURGH HE WOULD MEMORIZE THE FACES OF EVERYONE HE DELIVERED TO SO THAT HE COULD GREET THEM BY NAME IF HE SAW THEM OUTSIDE OF WORK
YOU1000000129_S0000016	IT WOULD PROVIDE CARNEGI WITH A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO FAMILIARIZE HIMSELF WITH THE CITY'S BUSINESS COMMUNITY AT SEVENTEEN HE WOULD PERFECT HIS TELEGRAPH SKILLS HE WOULD GROW INCREASINGLY SKILLED AT HEARING MORSE CODE
YOU1000000129_S0000017	IMPRESSIVELY HE COULD RECITE MESSAGES WITHOUT NEEDING TO WRITE THEM DOWN THIS CAUGHT THE EYE OF THOMAS SCOTT A REGIONAL MANAGER FOR THE PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD COMPANY WHO HIRED CARNEGI TO BE HIS PERSONAL TELEGRAPHER
YOU1000000129_S0000018	AND PRIVATE SECRETARY FOR THE SUM OF THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH AT THE TIME TE PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD COMPANY WAS THE LARGEST CORPORATION IN THE WORLD
YOU1000000129_S0000019	FOR THE BUSINESS SAVY CARNEKI IT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE NONE OTHER A FRONT ROW SEAT ON HOW TO RUN A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS
YOU1000000129_S0000020	TOM SCOTT HIS BOSS REALIZED CARNEGI'S POTENTIAL AND DECIDED TO TAKE THE BOY UNDER HIS WING MENTORING HIM LIKE A SECOND FATHER
YOU1000000129_S0000021	IT WOULD LATER BE TOM'S ADVICE TO INVEST IN STOCKS THAT PROVIDED CARNEGI WITH HIS FIRST TASTE OF CAPITALISM FAST FORWARD TO THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR CARNEGI IS DRAFTED INTO THE UNION BUT INSTEAD OF FIGHTING IN THE WAR
YOU1000000129_S0000022	CARNEGI WOULD PROFIT FROM IT HE WAS ABLE TO ESCAPE HARM'S WAY AFTER PAYING EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS FOR A SUBSTITUTE TO TAKE HIS PLACE ON THE BATTLEFIELD IT WAS DURING THIS TIME THAT CARNEGI NOTICED THAT THE WOODEN BRIDGES WERE EASILY BURNT BY THE TROOPS
YOU1000000129_S0000023	AND THAT THERE WAS A DESPERATE NEED FOR IRON BRIDGES TO REPLACE THEM HE CAPITALIZED ON THE OPPORTUNITY LAUNCHING THE KEYSTONE BRIDGE COMPANY BUT IT WOULD BE HIS NEXT MOVE THAT WOULD DEFINE HIM AS AN ASTUTE BUSINESSMAN
YOU1000000129_S0000024	KEYSTONE DIDN'T JUST BUILD BRIDGES THEY ALSO HAD THEIR VERY OWN IRON MILLS WHICH PROVIDED THE IRON THAT WAS NEEDED FOR CONSTRUCTING THE BRIDGES
YOU1000000129_S0000025	OWNING THE IRON SOURCE MEANT THAT KARNIGI'S BRIDGEBUILDING COMPANY WOULD NOT BE DEPENDENT ON MINING OR EXTRACTING COMPANIES FOR IRON LIKE THEIR COMPETITORS THIS NOT ONLY GAVE KARNEGI MORE CONTROL OVER THE ENTIRE PROCESS IT ALSO IMPROVED THEIR MARGINS
YOU1000000129_S0000026	AFTER THE BRIDGE WAS BUILT HE WOULD LEVERAGE HIS CONNECTIONS IN THE RAILROAD INDUSTRY TO MAKE MONEY THERE TOO ESSENTIALLY HE WAS OPERATING A TRIAD OF THREE COMPANIES EACH STRENGTHENING ONE ANOTHER
YOU1000000129_S0000027	FIRST A MINING EXTRACTION COMPANY SECOND A BRIDGE BUILDING COMPANY WHICH USED THE IRON PROVIDED FROM HIS MINING COMPANY AND THEN ONCE THE BRIDGE WAS BUILT HIS THIRD BUSINESS WOULD MONETIZE BY SELLING RAIL
YOU1000000129_S0000028	THE CONCEPT WORKED TO A T
YOU1000000129_S0000029	ALWAYS LOOKING FOR THE NEXT BIG OPPORTUNITY ANDREWS SET HIS SIGHTES ON NEW YORK CITY THE UNDISPUTED BUSINESS CAPITAL OF THE WORLD IN THE CITY HE EXPECTED TO FIND A HUSTLING CULTURE AND MINGLE WITH OTHER DISTINGUISHED BUSINESSMEN
YOU1000000129_S0000030	BUT WHAT HE FOUND INSTEAD WAS DISAPPOINTMENT HE WOULD DESCRIBE THE WEALTHY INDIVIDUALS AROUND HIM AS SCOUNDRELS
YOU1000000129_S0000031	CARNEGI WROTE A NOTE TO HIMSELF PROMISING THAT IN TWO YEARS WHEN HE TURNED THIRTY FIVE HE WOULD RETIRE AND FOCUS ON MAKING THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE
YOU1000000129_S0000032	BUT THIS NOTE WOULD GO UNFULFILLED IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX A NEW INVENTION BY HENRY BESSIMER CALLED THE BESSIMER CONVERTER
YOU1000000129_S0000034	A PAIR SHAPED FURNACE WOULD ALLOW FOR THE MASS PRODUCTION OF STEEL SOMETHING PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT TO BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER IT WOULD FINALLY BECOME FEASIBLE TO CREATE LARGE STRUCTURES FROM STEEL
YOU1000000129_S0000035	EVENTUALLY GIVING BIRTH TO THE FIRST SKYSCRAPERS FOREVER TRANSFORMING A CITY'S SKYLINE CARNEGI MOVED WITH LIGHTENING SPEED SUCCESSFULLY BUILDING AMERICA'S FIRST STEEL PLANTS
YOU1000000129_S0000036	IN DOING SO HE HIRED THE BEST ENGINEERS AND ARCHITECTS THAT MONEY COULD BUY HE FOCUSED MONIICALLY ON INCREASING EFFICIENCY ALWAYS USING THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY AND PUSHING HIS EMPLOYEES TO THEIR MAXIMUM PHYSICAL AND MENTAL CAPABILITIES
YOU1000000129_S0000037	HE WAS ALSO NOTORIOUS FOR REQUIRING EMPLOYEES TO WORK THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR DAYS A YEAR ONLY ALLOWING FOR REST ON THE FOURTH OF JULY
YOU1000000129_S0000038	AS TECHNOLOGY CONTINUED TO ADVANCE HE WOULD SEEK WAYS TO REPLACE HIS WORKERS WITH MACHINES AT EVERY POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY
YOU1000000129_S0000039	UNLIKE MEN MACHINES DIDN'T NEED SLEEP THEY ALSO DIDN'T ASK FOR RAISORS AND THEY CERTAINLY DID NOT TRY TO UNIONIZE
YOU1000000129_S0000040	CARNEGI A MASTER SALESMAN DECIDED TO NAME THE VENTURE NOT KARNIGI STEEL BUT RATHER J EDGAR THOMPSON'S STEELWORKS THE NAME OF ONE OF HIS CUSTOMERS IN THE RAILROAD INDUSTRY
YOU1000000129_S0000041	CARNEGI HOPED A STEEL MILL NAMED AFTER A CUSTOMER WOULD SHOW HIS APPRECIATION FOR THEIR BUSINESS AND MAYBE EVEN SECURE MORE ORDERS FROM THEIR RAILROAD AND IT DID THE FIRST ORDER FROM THOMPSON CONSISTED OF TWO THOUSAND STEEL RAILS
YOU1000000129_S0000042	NAMING A MILL AFTER A CUSTOMER WAS MORE THAN A SALES GIMMIC IT WAS PART OF A LARGER STRATEGY SHOWING APPRECIATION IN PUBLIC FOR OTHERS
YOU1000000129_S0000043	ACTS LIKE THIS WOULD CONTINUE TO PAY MASSIVE DIVIDENDS THROUGHOUT THE TITAN'S CAREER TO HELP RUN CARNEGI'S STEELMILLS HE WOULD BRING ON BOARD A CUTTHROAT EXECUTIVE KNOWN FOR HIS RUTHLESSNESS AND ATTENTION TO THE BOTTOM LINE
YOU1000000129_S0000044	HENRY CLAY FRICK AS A TEAM CARNEGI AND FRICK WERE A POWERFUL FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH AND TO SHOW HOW RUTHLESS THE TWO COULD BE LOOK NO FARTHER THAN THE STORY ABOUT DUCANE WORKS
YOU1000000129_S0000045	WITH THE HELP OF FRICK CARNEGI SPREAD A RUMOUR WHICH ALLEGED THAT DUCAIN'S MILL WAS PRODUCING DEFECTIVE STEEL IT WASN'T TRUE BUT IT DIDN'T MATTER
YOU1000000129_S0000046	CARNEGI CLAIMED TO DUCAYNE'S RAILROAD CUSTOMERS THAT THEIR RAILS LACKED WHAT HE CALLED HOMOGENEITY FEW IF ANYONE ACTUALLY KNEW WHAT THE WORD MEANT BUT THAT WASN'T IMPORTANT
YOU1000000129_S0000047	CARNEGI USED THE WORD BECAUSE IT SOUNDED SCARY ENOUGH TO FRIGHTEN OFF RAILROADS WHO WERE CONCERNED THAT THEY WEREN'T GETTING GOOD PRODUCTS IF DUCANE'S SALES SLOWED THEY WOULD EVENTUALLY BECOME UNPROFITABLE AND RUN OUT OF MONEY
YOU1000000129_S0000048	TO EXPEDITE THEIR DEMISE CARNAKI AND FRICK WOULD PROCEED TO UNDERCUT DUCAN ON PRICE FURTHER SQUEEZING THE COMPANY
YOU1000000129_S0000049	WITHIN TWO YEARS DUCAINE'S FINANCES WERE IN RUINS LEAVING IT NO OTHER CHOICE TAN TO SELL TO NONE OTHER THAN CARNEGI AT A BARGAIN PRICE
YOU1000000129_S0000050	FOR FRICK AND KARNEGI THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT WERE CLEAR DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO WIN BUT THIS RUTHLESSNESS CAME WITH A HEAFTY PRICE AS THEY WOULD SOON DISCOVER AT ONE OF THEIR LARGEST STEEL PLANTS IN HOMESTEAD PENNSYLVANIA
YOU1000000129_S0000051	CARNEGI HAD JUST INVESTED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OPTIMIZING THE EFFICIENCY OF HOMESTEAD ENABLING IT TO PRODUCE MORE STEEL THAN ANY OTHER MILL COMPARABLE TO ITS SIZE
YOU1000000129_S0000052	BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER PART OF THE PROFIT MACHINE THAT WAS YET TO BE OPTIMIZED LABOUR COSTS THIS POSED A PROBLEM FOR CARNEGI WHO HAD BEEN WORKING ON REBRANDING HIS IMAGE FROM AN OPPRESSIVE STEEL FACTORY BILLIONAIRE TO A CHAMPION OF WORKERS RIGHTS
YOU1000000129_S0000053	SO INSTEAD OF RISKING HIS REPUTATION HE WOULD HAVE HIS RIGHT HAND LIEUTENANT HENRY FRICK EXECUTE THE DIRTY WORK MEANWHILE CARNEGI WOULD DISTANCE HIMSELF TRAVELLING ABROAD TO HIS HOME COUNTRY OF SCOTLAND
YOU1000000129_S0000054	CARNEGI KNEW THAT HE WOULDN'T WANT TO BE AROUND THE PLANT AFTER CUTTING WAGES FOR TEN THOUSAND ALREADY FRUSTRATED LOW PAID WORKERS
YOU1000000129_S0000055	IN EIGHTEN NINETY TWO TENSIONS BETWEEN WORKERS AND MILL OWNERS WERE PARTICULARLY HEIGHTENED AFTER AN EVER WIDENING WEALTH GAP CONTINUED TO GROW THE RICHEST PEOPLE IN AMERICA WERE ACCUMULATING FORTUNES FASTER THAN AT ANY TIME IN AMERICAN HISTORY
YOU1000000129_S0000056	MEANWHILE WORKERS FELT THAT THEY WERE PROPERTY OF THE RICH AND THAT THEIR SHRINKING VOICE COULD ONLY BE HEARD THROUGH A UNION TO MAKE THINGS EVEN WORSE
YOU1000000129_S0000057	FRICK WHO TOOK HIS ORDERS FROM KARNEGI DEMANDED INCREASED FACTORY PRODUCTION WHICH WOULD MEAN EVEN MORE HOURS SLAVING AWAY BUT TO TOP IT ALL OFF FRICK WOULD NOT BE INCREASING THEIR INCOME
YOU1000000129_S0000058	HE'D BE REDUCING IT LONGER HOURS AND LESS PAY PUT HOMESTEAD AT A BOILING POINT THE STRIKERS ALSO DEMANDED SAFER WORKING CONDITIONS AND FOR A GOOD REASON
YOU1000000129_S0000059	IN EIGHTEEN NINETY EIGHT NINE PERCENT OF ALL STEEL WORKERS INDUSTRY WIDE WOULD DIE ON THE JOB WHEN THE WORKERS REFUSED FRICK'S AGGRESSIVE DEMANDS FOR LONGER HOURS AND LESS PAY HE DECIDED TO LOCK OUT ALL EMPLOYEES
YOU1000000129_S0000060	AND BRING IN A SUBSTITUTE GROUP OF IMMIGRANT WORKERS WHO WOULD BE WILLING TO DO THEIR DANGEROUS JOBS FOR LESS
YOU1000000129_S0000061	TO ESCORT THE IMMIGRANT WORKERS AS THEY MADE THEIR WAY TO THE FACTORY FRICK CALLED ON A THREE HUNDRED PERSON ARMY FOR HIRE CALLED THE PINKETANS ARMED WITH RIFLES
YOU1000000129_S0000062	THEY MADE THEIR WAY TO THE FACTORY WHERE THEY WERE MET BY TEN THOUSAND ANGRY STRIKERS REFUSING TO GIVE UP WHAT THEY CALLED HOME
YOU1000000129_S0000063	HISTORIANS DON'T KNOW WHO FIRED THE FIRST GUNSHOT BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THE DAY WOULD NO LONGER BE CALLED THE HOMESTEAD STRIKE
YOU1000000129_S0000064	BUT RATHER THE HOMESTEAD MASSACRE BY THE END OF THE BATTLE NINE FACTORY WORKERS AND SEVEN PINKERTONS WOULD BE DEAD
YOU1000000129_S0000066	HUNDREDS WOULD BE INJURED THE FIGHTING WAS SO EXTREME THAT THE GOVERNOR ORDERED FOR EIGHT THOUSAND MILITIA TROOPS TO PROVIDE BACKUP UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE STATE'S TROOPS THE FACTORY WOULD BE REOPENED
YOU1000000129_S0000067	AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR CARNEGI'S WORKERS THEY WOULD BE RETURNING WITH LOWER PAY LONGER WORKING HOURS AND THE SAME SAFETY CONDITIONS
YOU1000000129_S0000068	ANOTHER COLLATERAL DAMAGE FROM HOMESTEAD CAME IN THE FORM OF CARNEGI'S REPUTATION PRIOR TO THE TRAGEDIES AT HOMESTED HE WOULD OFTEN ADVOCATE IN PUBLIC FOR BETTER CONDITIONS IN STEELMILLS AND INCREASED WAGES
YOU1000000129_S0000069	BUT THESE WORDS WERE FAR FROM ALIGNED WITH HIS ACTIONS HYPOCRISY WAS INCREDIBLY PREVALENT WHILE HE PREACHED INCREASED WAGES AND IMPROVED SAFETY CONDITIONS
YOU1000000129_S0000070	HE WAS SIMULTANEOUSLY REDUCING LABOUR COSTS BY SLASHING PAYCHECKS AND DOING LITTLE IF ANYTHING TO MAKE HIS FACTORIES A SAFER PLACE TO WORK
YOU1000000129_S0000071	CARNEGI WAS WIDELY CALLED A COWARD FOR USING FRICK AS HIS SCAPEGOAT NOT ONLY FOR THE TRAGEDY BUT FOR ALL THE OTHER DIRTY WORK THAT HE DIDN'T WANT HIS NAME TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH
YOU1000000129_S0000072	BUT IN SPITE OF THE TENSIONS AND ANIMOSITY THE STEEL MILLS CONTINUED TO THRIVE IN FACT BY NINETEEN HUNDRED THE COMPANY WOULD PRODUCE MORE STEEL THAN THE ENTIRE NATION OF GREAT BRITAIN
YOU1000000129_S0000073	BUT IN NINETEN OW ONE CARNEGI GREW TIRED OF THE GAME AND WANTED TO SPEND TIME WITH HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER
YOU1000000129_S0000074	FINANCIER J P MORGAN WAS A RISING COMPETITOR IN THE STEEL INDUSTRY AND CARNEGI NOW NEARING SEVENTY BECAME OPEN TO THE IDEA OF SELLING THE COMPANY HE'D SPENT HIS ENTIRE LIFE BUILDING
YOU1000000129_S0000075	CARNEGI WROTE ON A SCRAP OF PAPER WHAT HE WOULD BE WILLING TO ACCEPT CHARLES SHWAB THE PRESIDENT OF CARNEGI STEEL DELIVERED THE OFFER TO MORGAN
YOU1000000129_S0000076	AS THE STORY GOES JP MORGAN GLANCED AT THE OFFER AND WITHOUT HESITATION ACCEPTED IT MORGAN WOULD BUY CARNEGI STEEL FOR FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS MAKING KARNEGI THE SINGLE RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD AT THE TIME
YOU1000000129_S0000077	CARNEGI WOULD COMPLETELY CUT TIHES WITH HIS BUSINESS LIFE AND DEDICATE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF HIMSELF TO SERVING THE WORLD THROUGH PHILANTHROPY NOT A SINGLE DOLLAR WOULD BE LEFT TO HIS FAMILY
YOU1000000129_S0000078	BECAUSE ANDREW HAD ONLY FIVE YEARS OF SCHOOLING HE HAD A SOFT SPOT FOR LIBRARIES WHICH HE CREDITS FOR HELPING HIM ACHIEVE THE FINANCIAL SUCCESS HE ACQUIRED
YOU1000000129_S0000079	OVER THE COURSE OF HIS LIFE HE WOULD DONATE OVER TWO AND A HALF THOUSAND LIBRARIES TO CITIES ALL AROUND THE WORLD BUT IT WASN'T ALL SELF PROMOTION HE WAS GENEROUS FOR GENEROSITY'S SAKE HIS NAME WAS ONLY DISPLAYED ON LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED OF THOSE LIBRARIES
YOU1000000129_S0000080	ONE EXAMPLE OF HIS GENEROSITY IS CARNEGI HALL ONE OF NEW YORK'S MOST RECOGNIZABLE LANDMARKS BUILT IN EIGHT NINETY ONE CARNEGI BUILT AND DONATED THE BUILDING AS THE MUSIC HALL
YOU1000000129_S0000081	BUT ITS ORIGINAL NAME OF THE MUSIC HALL WAS ONLY CHANGED TO THE CURRENT VERSION AFTER HIS DEATH AND NOT BY HIS REQUEST BUT THROUGH THE MUSIC HALL'S BOARD MEMBERS AND FROM NINETEEN OW ONE UNTIL HIS DEATH IN NINETEN NINETEEN IN LENORX MASSACHUSETTS
YOU1000000129_S0000082	CARNEGI'S FULL TIME JOB WAS GIVING AWAY THE VAST WEALTH HE HAD BUILT UP FOR HIMSELF AS WE MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS STORY CARNEGI WAS A MAN WHO WAS AS COMPLEX AS HE WAS RICH
YOU1000000129_S0000083	DID HE EMPLOY ABUSIVE LABOUR TECHNIQUES TO KEEP HIS FACTORIES PRODUCING MAXIMUM PROFIT YES WAS HE HYPOCRITICAL OF COURSE DID HE MAKE UP SLANDER TO PUT HIS COMPETITORS OUT OF BUSINESS ABSOLUTELY
YOU1000000129_S0000084	WHILE THESE THINGS ARE ALL TRUE CARNEGI'S PHILANTHROPIC IMPACT IS ALSO EQUALLY GREAT PERPLEXING TO SAY THE LEAST HOW CAN A MAN COMMIT SUCH SINS AND THEN BECOME A SAINT
YOU1000000129_S0000085	PERHAPS HE VIEWED DONATING HIS MONEY AS A WAY TO ATONE FOR HIS BUSINESS SINS MAKING MONEY IS A GREAT FEELING BUT AN EVEN BETTER FEELING IS GIVING IT AWAY IF YOU WANT TO GROW WEALTH AND PERHAPS DONATE TO NOBLE CAUSES LIKE CARNEGI DID

YOU1000000130_S0000000	HENRY FORD ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL AMERICAN INDUSTRIALISTS THROUGH HIS COMPANY HENRY TRANSFORMED AMERICAN LIFE AND IN THIS VIDEO WE'RE GOING TO LEARN HOW HE DID IT STARTING FROM THE VERY BEGINNING
YOU1000000130_S0000002	THIS VIDEO IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY AUDIBLE AND A BIG PART OF IT IS BASED ON HENRY FORD'S BIOGRAPHY WHICH YOU CAN LISTEN TO FOR FREE ON AUDIBOLE IF YOU REGISTER FOR FREE TRIAL WITH THE LINK IN THE DESCRIPTION
YOU1000000130_S0000003	YOU SHOULD ALSO CHECK OUT REAL ENGINEERING'S VIDEO ON THE MANUFACTURING INNOVATIONS OF THE ASSEMBLY LINE WHICH HE EXPLAINS MASTERFULLY ON HIS CHANNEL
YOU1000000130_S0000005	Y ALL ACCOUNTS HENRY FORD SHOULD HAVE BEEN A FARMER BORN IN MICHIGAN BARELY TWENTY YEARS AFTER IT HAD BECOME A STATE
YOU1000000130_S0000006	HENRY GREW UP AT A TIME WHEN FARMING WAS SLOW EXHAUSTING AND MANUAL WHICH IS WHY UNSURPRISINGLY HE CAME TO HATE IT WITH A PASSION BUT WHEREAS MOST PEOPLE AT THE TIME DIDN'T HAVE THE FORTUNE TO ESCAPE WHAT THEY WERE BORN INTO
YOU1000000130_S0000007	HENRY WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO GET SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY YOU SEE THE VILLAGE HE WAS BORN INTO WAS JUST EIGHT MILES WEST OF DETROIT WHICH WAS RAPIDLY BECOMING AN INDUSTRIAL CENTER THANKS TO THE STEAM ENGINE
YOU1000000130_S0000008	EARLY ON IN HIS CHILDHOOD HENRY ENCOUNTERED TECHNOLOGY WHICH FEW CHILDREN HIS AGE COULD PLAY AROUND WITH
YOU1000000130_S0000009	HE TINKERD WITH THE WATCHES OF HIS BETTER OFF NEIGHBORS AND BY THE TIME HE WAS TWELVE HE COULD NOT JUST TAKE THEM APART BUT ALSO PUT THEM BACK TOGETHER AND REPAIR THEM
YOU1000000130_S0000010	HIS INTEREST GREW INTO AN OBSESSION WHEN HE GOT TO OBSERVE A WORKING STEAM ENGINE FIRST HAND WHILE ON A SCHOOL TRIP TO ONE OF THE RAIL COMPANIES IN DETROIT
YOU1000000130_S0000011	BY THE TIME HENRY HAD BECOME A TEENAGER THE STEAM ENGINE WAS ALREADY MAKING ITS WAY INTO THE FARMING COMMUNITY COAL POWERED THRESHING MACHINES AND SAWMILLS WERE BECOMING COMMON SIGHT AND HENRY WAS LEARNING HOW THEY WORKED AND HOW TO FIX THEM
YOU1000000130_S0000012	AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN HE MADE A BIG LEAP FORWARD WHEN AGAINST HIS FATHER'S WISHES HE LEFT HIS VILLAGE TO GO WORK IN DETROIT WHERE ANY YOUNG MECHANIC COULD EASILY FIND VERY LUCRATIVE EMPLOYMENT
YOU1000000130_S0000013	INDUSTRY IN DETROIT WAS BOOMING AND IT HAD BEEN DOING SO FOR CLOSE TO FIVE DECADES IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY FIVE A CANAL HAD BEEN DUG CONNECTING THE HUDSON RIVER TO THE GREAT LAKES WHICH AT THE TIME WERE EFFECTIVELY THE WESTERN FRONTIER
YOU1000000130_S0000014	ALL THE UNTAPPED RESOURCES THAT HAD NO WAY OF GETTING OUT COULD SUDDENLY BE MOVED BY STEAMBOAT TO NEW YORK AND IN THE SPAN OF JUST FIFTY YEARS DETROIT'S POPULATION INCREASED BY A FACTOR OF TEN
YOU1000000130_S0000015	WITH VAST MINES IN THE NORTH PRODUCING COPPER AND IRON AND LUMBER MILLS OPENING UP VIRTUALLY EVERYWHERE
YOU1000000130_S0000016	ALL THIS METAL AND WOOD SUSTAINED CLOSE TO A THOUSAND COMPANIES IN DETROIT ALONE INCLUDING THE ONES IN WHICH HENRY WOULD WORK AT OVER THE COURSE OF THE EIGHTEEN EIGHTY S
YOU1000000130_S0000017	IT IS DURING THIS TIME THAT HENRY BY CHANCE LEARNED ABOUT THE GAS ENGINE FROM A BRITISH MAGAZINE IT WAS BEING PRODUCED IN SMALL NUMBERS BY A GERMAN ENGINEER NICHOLAS ATTO
YOU1000000130_S0000018	AND IT WAS GAINING SOME TRACTION IN EUROPE BUT IT WAS PRACTICALLY UNHEARD OF IN AMERICA HENRY WOULD GET THE CHANCE TO WORK ON SUCH AN ENGINE HIMSELF IN EIGHTEN EIGHTY NINE AND HE INSTANTLY RECOGNIZED THE ADVANTAGES IT HAD
YOU1000000130_S0000019	BECAUSE IT DID NOT USE STEAM THE ENGINE WAS MUCH LIGHTER AND GOT RID OF THE HEAVY BOILER AND ALL THE WATER IN IT BECAUSE IT DID ALL THE COMBUSTION INTERNALLY A MUCH MORE EFFICIENT PROCESS
YOU1000000130_S0000020	THIS ALSO ALLOWED THE GAS ENGINE TO START QUICKLY WHEREAS STEAM ENGINES OF THE TIME NEEDED AS MUCH AS THIRTY MINUTES TO HEAT UP THE WATER AND GENERATE ENOUGH STEAM TO START WORKING THE GAS ENGINE WAS AN INNOVATION HENRY FELL IN LOVE WITH
YOU1000000130_S0000021	BUT IT WAS ALSO ONE HE DIDN'T FULLY UNDERSTAND AFTER ALL HE HAD EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE WITH STEAM AND METAL BUT ALMOST NONE WITH ELECTRICITY AND THE GAS ENGINE WAS FIRED BY AN ELECTRIC SPARK
YOU1000000130_S0000022	TO OBTAIN THIS MISSING KNOWLEDGE HENRY WENT TO WORK FOR THE LOCAL BRANCH OF THE EDISON ILLUMINATING COMPANY
YOU1000000130_S0000023	IT WAS GENERATING ELECTRICITY FOR OVER A THOUSAND HOMES IN DETROIT AND IT WAS DOING SO BY USING STEAM ENGINES SO HENRY WAS A NATURAL HIRE FOR THEM WHENEVER THE ENGINES BROKE HENRY HAD TO FIX THEM BUT WHENEVER THEY WERE WORKING
YOU1000000130_S0000024	HE WAS FREE TO DO AS HE WISHED IT WAS THE PERFECT JOB THAT ALLOWED HIM TO SPEND HIS DAYS EXPERIMENTING WITH GAS ENGINES IN EIGHTEEN NINETY THREE WHEN HENRY HAD ALREADY BEEN PROMOTED TO CHIEF ENGINEER AT EDISON
YOU1000000130_S0000025	HE CREATED HIS FIRST WORKING GAS ENGINE THE IDEA OF USING THE GAS ENGINE TO CREATE A HORSELESS CARRIAGE HAD BEEN AROUND IN HENRY'S MIND SINCE HE FIRST LAID EYES ON ONE BUT ACTUALLY MAKING THAT IDEA A REALITY WOULD TAKE YEARS OF WORK
YOU1000000130_S0000026	BUILDING A CAR IN A WORLD WITH NO CAR PARTS WASN'T EASY AND HENRY HAD TO FIGURE OUT EVERY DETAIL THROUGH TRIAL AND ERROR IT TOOK HIM THREE YEARS OF CONSTANT EFFORT TO PRODUCE THIS THE QUADRUCYCLE
YOU1000000130_S0000027	A SIMPLE FRAME WITH AN ENGINE POWERED BY ETHANOL AND FOUR BICYCLE WHEELS MOUNTED ONTO IT IT HAD ONLY TWO GEARS AND NEITHER ONE WAS FOR GOING IN REVERSE BUT WHAT'S WORSE IS THAT IT HAD NO COOLING SYSTEM TO SPEAK OF
YOU1000000130_S0000028	THUS MAKING OVERHEATING A CONSTANT ISSUE IN ITS FIRST YEAR HENRY MADE NUMEROUS IMPROVEMENTS TO THE QUADRICYCLE MOST NOTABLY ADDING A COOLING SYSTEM AND BY THE TIME HE SOLD IT IN EIGHTEN NINETY SEVEN FOR TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS
YOU1000000130_S0000029	HE HAD DRIVEN A THOUSAND MILES IT HENRY BUILT A SECOND QUADRICYCLE AND THEN A THIRD ONE ALWAYS IMPROVING THE DESIGN BEFORE FINALLY FEELING CONFIDENT ENOUGH IN EIGHTEN NINETY NINE TO START HIS OWN COMPANY
YOU1000000130_S0000031	CAPITALIZED AT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THE DETROIT AUTOMOBILE COMPANY WAS A VERY AMBITIOUS VENTURE MANY OF THE DETROIT ELITE INVESTED IN IT INCLUDING HENRY'S FRIENDS FROM THE EDDISON COMPANY
YOU1000000130_S0000032	AND EVERYONE WAS EAGER TO SEE WHAT HENRY COULD CREATE WITH PROPER CAPITAL HENRY'S PLAN WAS VERY CLEVER SINCE HE PERSONALLY KNEW MANY OF THE INDUSTRIALISTS IN DETROIT BY THAT POINT HE'D TRY TO BUILD AN AUTOMOBILE THEY COULD USE IN THEIR BUSINESSES
YOU1000000130_S0000033	HE LEASED A FACTORY AND PLANNED TO HIRE A HUNDRED WORKERS TO MAKE HIS NEW DELIVERY WAGGON AS HE CALLED IT BUT IT TURNED OUT THAT BUILDING SUCH COMPLEX MACHINES IN HIGH NUMBERS WAS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT THAN HENRY IMAGINED
YOU1000000130_S0000034	THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE PARTS USED IN THE MAKING OF THE DELIVERY WAGON WERE PRODUCED BY OTHER COMPANIES AND EVERY TIME A SINGLE DELIVERY WAS LATE THE ENTIRE FACTORY WOULD HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO STOP WORKING
YOU1000000130_S0000035	THE FIRST DELIVERY WAGON TOOK SIX MONTHS TO PRODUCE AND NO MORE THAN TWENTY WERE MADE IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THE COMPANY'S EXISTENCE BY THE END OF NINETEEN OW TWO THE OTHER SHAREHOLDERS WERE SICK OF HENRY'S LACK OF PROGRESS
YOU1000000130_S0000036	AND ACTUALLY VOTED TO GET RID OF HIM NOW BECAUSE HENRY HELD ONLY FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THE COMPANY HE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO COMPLY
YOU1000000130_S0000037	AND INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH THE MAN WHO TOOK OVER THE DETROIT AUTOMOBILE COMPANY WOULD EVENTUALLY TRANSFORM IT INTO CATALAC BUT THAT'S A STORY FOR A DIFFERENT TIME WHAT MATTERS IS THAT HENRY WAS PUSHED OUT OF HIS OWN COMPANY
YOU1000000130_S0000038	AND HAD ONLY A THOUSAND DOLLARS TO HIS NAME IT WAS BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD AND THIS TIME HENRY WOULD TAKE A VERY DIFFERENT APPROACH INSTEAD OF TARGETING BUSINESSES WITH EXPENSIVE MACHINES HENRY WOULD DESIGN A VEHICLE TO BE USED BY THE AVERAGE MAN
YOU1000000130_S0000039	YOU SEE AT THE TIME VIRTUALLY ALL CARS WERE HIGH TICKET ITEMS THEY WERE MOSTLY MADE BY SKILLED CRAFTSMEN ONE AT A TIME AND MORE OFTEN THAN NOT WERE DESIGNED FOR RACING WHICH WAS RAPIDLY BECOMING A FAVORITE AMERICAN ACTIVITY
YOU1000000130_S0000040	HENRY ENVISIONED TURNING THE CAR FROM A STATUS SYMBOL INTO A COMMODITY BUT DOING THAT WOULD NOT BE EASY AND IN FACT IT TOOK HENRY TWENTY DIFFERENT DESIGN ITERATIONS BEFORE HE FINALLY GOT ONE THAT WORKED
YOU1000000130_S0000041	HENRY LABELED HIS FIRST DESIGN AS THE MODEL A AND WORKED HIS WAY THROUGH THE ALPHABET OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS SUSTAINED BY CAPITAL FROM HIS FRIENDS AND FAMILY
YOU1000000130_S0000042	BUT WHAT CHANGED THE MOST DURING THIS TIME IS NOT THE CAR ITSELF BUT THE PRODUCTION PROCESS HENRY LEARNED THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING A RELIABLE SUPPLY CHAIN WHEN HIS FIRST COMPANY FAILED WHICH IS WHY THIS TIME AROUND
YOU1000000130_S0000043	HE TRIED GETTING AS MANY PARTS AS POSSIBLE FROM THE SAME MANUFACTURER THE ONE HE CHOSE WILL PROBABLY SOUND FAMILIAR THE DODG BROTHERS COMPANY A MACHINE SHOP IN DETROIT THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY EVOLVE INTO THE AUTONOMOUS AMERICAN BRAND
YOU1000000130_S0000044	THE BIGGEST GAME CHANGER OF ALL HOWEVER WAS HENRY'S CHANCE VISIT TO A SLAUGHTER HOUSE IN CHICAGO HE SAW THERE SOMETHING INTERESTING A DISASSEMBLY LINE SO TO SPEAK WHERE MULTIPLE WORKERS WOULD PROCESS CARCASSES MOVING DOWN TA LINE
YOU1000000130_S0000045	HENRY FIGURED HE COULD USE THE SAME PROCESS BUT IN REVERSE AN ASSEMBLY LINE USING THE MONEY HE HAD SAVED FROM SOME OF HIS EARLIER MODELS WHICH WERE ALSO ASSEMBLED BY THE DOTCH BROTHERS
YOU1000000130_S0000046	HENRY WAS ABLE TO BUILD A FACTORY OF HIS OWN IN NINETEEN OW FOUR WHERE HE COULD EXPERIMENT WITH THE ASSEMBLY LINE PROCESS BY NINETEEN OW FIVE THE FORD FACTORY EMPLOYED OVER THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE THAT BUILT TWENTY FIVE CARS A DAY
YOU1000000130_S0000047	BUT HENRY STILL HADN'T FIGURED EVERYTHING OUT HE WAS PRODUCING MULTIPLE DIFFERENT MODELS AT THE SAME TIME WHICH PREVENTED HIM FROM PROPERLY USING AN ASSEMBLY LINE
YOU1000000130_S0000048	NEVERTHELESS THERE WAS A SIGN OF THINGS TO COME THE AFFORDABLE MARO N CREATED IN NINETEEN OW SIX BECAME THE BEST SELLING CAR IN THE U S AND FORD BECAME THE BIGGEST CAR PRODUCER IN AMERICA
YOU1000000130_S0000049	IT IS ACTUALLY DURING THE PRODUCTION OF THIS MODEL THAT HENRY WOULD FIRST USE THE ASSEMBLY LINE PROCESS TO AT LEAST PARTIALLY ASSEMBLE SOME OF HIS CARS
YOU1000000130_S0000050	IT WASN'T A FULL MOVING ASSEMBLY LINE BUT NEVERTHELESS THIS EXPERIMENT INCREASED PRODUCTION BY A FACTOR OF FIVE IN THE SAME FACTORY LOGISTICS OF COURSE WAS ANOTHER BIG PART OF HENRY'S SUCCESS
YOU1000000130_S0000051	IN NINETEEN OW FIVE HE CREATED THE FORD MANUFACTURING COMPANY COMPLETE WITH ITS OWN FACTORY TO START MAKING THE ENGINES AND TRANSMISSIONS OF HENRY'S CARS TO FURTHER ELIMINATE ANY POSSIBILITY OF DELAYS
YOU1000000130_S0000052	BUT THE BIGGEST FACTOR IN HENRY'S SUCCESS CAME FROM PERHAPS THE MOST UNEXPECTED PLACE PERU NOW THIS IS A STORY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HEAR ANYWHERE ELSE SO LISTEN CAREFULLY
YOU1000000130_S0000053	IN NINETEEN OW SEVEN HENRY BEGAN CONSTRUCTION OF A HEAT TREATMENT PLANT TO PRODUCE VANADIAN STEEL
YOU1000000130_S0000054	THIS ALLOY WAS NEW TO AMERICA IN FACT FEW FURNACES IN THE U S COULD EVEN REACH THE TEMPERATURE NEEDED TO MANUFACTURE IT THE DIFFICULTY IN PRODUCING IT HOWEVER WAS WORTH IT
YOU1000000130_S0000055	BECAUSE VANADIAM STEEL WAS MORE THAN TWICE AS STRONG AS REGULAR STEEL WHILE ACTUALLY BEING LIGHTER NOW AT THE TIME VANADIAN METALERGY WAS CUTTING EDGE RESEARCH
YOU1000000130_S0000056	BUT HENRY HAD AN EXTREMELY LUCKY CONNECTION HE WAS FRIENDS WITH THE TWO BROTHERS WHO OWNED THE ONE VANADIAN MINE IN PERU PRODUCING NINETY TWO PERCENT OF THE WORLD'S SUPPLY
YOU1000000130_S0000057	JOSEPH AND JAMES FLANNERY HAD COMMERCIALIZED VANADIUM STEEL IN EUROPE AND IN THE US BY SELLING IT TO RAIL COMPANIES BUT THEIR PERUVIAN MINE WAS PRODUCING SO MUCH VANADIUM THAT THEY HAD TO DO SOMETHING ELSE WITH IT
YOU1000000130_S0000059	THEY SOLD VANADIAM STEEL TO THE U S GOVERNMENT FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PANAMA CANAL BUT EVEN THAT WASN'T ENOUGH SO WHEN THEY MET HENRY IN NINETEEN OW SIX THEY IMMEDIATELY MADE HIM AN OFFER
YOU1000000130_S0000060	THEY WOULD HELP HIM TRANSITION HIS ENTIRE MANUFACTURING PROCESS TO USE VANNADIAN STEEL IT WAS THEIR CHIEF ENGINEER THAT BUILT THE HEAT TREATMENT PLANT FOR HENRY IN NINETEN OW SEVEN
YOU1000000130_S0000061	AND IT WAS THEIR COMPANY THAT SUPPLIED FORD WITH ALL THE VANADIUM IT NEEDED FOR ITS CARS THE FIRST FORD CAR DESIGNED WITH VANADIAN STEEL WAS TE MARO T IN NINETEEN O EIGHT AND IT WAS THIS ALLOY THAT ACTUALLY MADE IT SUCCESSFUL
YOU1000000130_S0000062	IT WASN'T THE CHEAPEST CAR HENRY HAD MADE THE MODEL N AND ITS UPSCALE VERSIONS WERE ACTUALLY CHEAPER BUT IT DIDN'T NEED TO BE BECAUSE IT WAS BY FAR THE BEST CAR BUILT AT THE TIME MUCH STRONGER THAN ANY COMPETITOR
YOU1000000130_S0000063	THE SHEER DIFFERENCE IN QUALITY WAS THE ONLY MARKETING HENRY NEEDED AND WITHIN WEEKS OF THE MODEL T'S RELEASE FORD RECEIVED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND ORDERS FOR IT
YOU1000000130_S0000064	EVEN THOUGH IT MANAGED TO PRODUCE ONLY SEVENTEEN THOUSAND UNITS FOR THE ENTIRETY OF NINETEEN O NINE HENRY REALIZED JUST HOW BIG OF A DEAL THE MODELTY WAS WHICH IS WHY HE BUILT A SECOND FACTORY IN NINETEN TEN
YOU1000000130_S0000065	AND IT IS THERE THAT HE WOULD PERFECT THE MOVING ASSEMBLY LINE IN NINETEN THIRTEEN DURING THIS PERIOD PRODUCTION WOULD DOUBLE EVERY YEAR IN NINETEEN TEN HE BUILT TWENTY THOUSAND MODEL TES
YOU1000000130_S0000066	AND JUST SIX YEARS LATER HE WAS BUILDING OVER HALF A MILLION AT THE SAME TIME HENRY ADOPTED ANOTHER BRILLIANT STRATEGY HE WAS CONSTANTLY REDUCING THE PRICE OF HIS CARS TO FURTHER INCREASE HIS MARKET SHARE
YOU1000000130_S0000067	IN FACT DURING THESE SIX YEARS HE CUT THE MODEL TES PRICE BY MORE THAN HALF BY NINETEEN EIGHTEEN HALF OF ALL CARS IN AMERICA WERE MODEL TES AND THIS TREND WOULD CONTINUE WELL INTO THE NINETEEN TWENTY S
YOU1000000130_S0000068	HENRY HAD BEGUN A NEW AGE IN AMERICAN HISTORY THE AGE OF THE AUTOMOBILE AND IT WAS HIS COMPANY THAT WOULD TOTALLY DOMINATE IT IN ITS FIRST TWO DECADES
YOU1000000130_S0000069	IT WASN'T UNTIL THE END OF THE NINETEEN TWENTY S THAT THE REST OF THE AUTO INDUSTRY CAUGHT UP TO HENRY BUT AT THAT POINT HE WAS ALREADY ONE OF THE RICHEST MEN ALIVE
YOU1000000130_S0000070	IN NINETEEN TWENTY TWO HE ACTUALLY TOOK THE TIME TO WRITE AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY WHERE PARTS OF THIS VIDEO CAME FROM AND WHICH YOU CAN LISTEN TO FOR FREE AS PART OF YOUR THIRTY DAY FREE TRIAL OF AUTIBO
YOU1000000130_S0000071	IN HIS BOOK HENRY NOT ONLY RECOUNTS HIS EXPERIENCES IN A VERY ELOQUENT FASHION HE ALSO SHARES PLENTY OF BUSINESS ADVICE THAT IS ACTUALLY STILL RELEVANT TODAY

YOU1000000131_S0000001	IN TODAY'S VIDEO WE'LL BE LOOKING AT A BUSINESS EMPIRE SO VAST THAT EVEN AFTER A HUNDRED YEARS OF TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS NO MAN HAS MANAGED TO OVERTAKE ITS FOUNDER THIS IS THE HISTORY OF STANDARD OIL
YOU1000000131_S0000003	THIS VIDEO IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY DOLLAR SHAVE CLUB VISIT THE LINK IN THE DESCRIPTION TO LEARN ABOUT THE AWESOME DEAL THEY'RE OFFERING
YOU1000000131_S0000005	THE ORIGINS OF HISTORY'S GREATEST OIL MONOPOLY ARE ACTUALLY PRETTY HUMBLE IT ALL STARTS IN EIGHTN THIRTY NINE WITH THE BIRTH OF JOHN ROCKEFELLER IN UPSTATE NEW YORK HE WAS THE ELDEST SON OF A TRAVELLING MERCHANT
YOU1000000131_S0000006	WHO IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS A BAUTANIC PHYSICIAN BUT IN REALITY WAS SELLING THE NINETEENTH CENTURY EQUIVALENT OF HOMEOPATHIC MEDICINE
YOU1000000131_S0000007	HE WOULD SPEND WEEKS AWAY FROM HOME AND IN FACT WOULD HAVE SEVERAL CHILDREN WITH ANOTHER WOMAN WHO HE DECIDED TO BRING BACK HOME TO HIS WIFE
YOU1000000131_S0000008	SO THEY COULD ALL LIVE TOGETHER IN THIS VERY CONFUSING HOUSEHOLD JOHN WOULD GROW UP LEARNING HOW TO HUSTLE PEOPLE FOR THE BEST DEAL POSSIBLE AND HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF EVERY PENNY HE GOT HIS FAMILY WOULD RARELY STAY IN ONE PLACE FOR LONG
YOU1000000131_S0000009	AND JOHN WOULD LIVE THIS NOMADIC LIFESTYLE EVER SINCE HE WAS THREE YEARS OLD TO HELP HIS MOTHER JOHN WOULD EARN ANY MONEY HE COULD BY RAISING TURKEYS OR DOING WORK FOR NEIGHBORS HIS INTELLIGENCE WAS PUT TO GOOD USE
YOU1000000131_S0000010	WHEN THE FAMILY MOVED TO CLEVELAND OHIO IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY FOUR WHERE HE GOT THE CHANCE TO ATTEND A PROPER SCHOOL BUT LESS THAN A YEAR LATER JOHN DROPPED OUT IN ORDER TO WORK AS A BOOKKEEPER THE LOCAL PRODUCE BROKER HE WOULD EARN FIFTY CENTS PER DAY
YOU1000000131_S0000011	WHICH OBVIOUSLY WASN'T MUCH AT THE TIME SO HE WOULD HELP OTHER COMPANIES ON THE SIDE BUT AFTER TWO YEARS OF WORKING THERE HIS BOSSES REFUSED TO GIVE HIM A MEANINGFUL RAISE SO HE DECIDED TO WON UP THEM BY STARTING HIS OWN PRODUCE BROKERAGE
YOU1000000131_S0000012	THANKS TO HIS GOOD REPUTATION HE GOT A LOAN OF FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH AT THE TIME WAS A HUGE SUM JOHN STARTED TRADING HAY GRAIN AND VARIOUS MEATS AND IN HIS FIRST YEAR HE RECORDED SALES OF HALF A MILLION DOLLARS
YOU1000000131_S0000013	OF WHICH HE ONLY GOT A SMALL FRACTION HIS COMMISSIONS BUT STILL IT WAS A HUGE SUCCESS EVERY BANK IN CLEVELAND WAS BEGGING JOHN TO BORROW MONEY AND HE WAS BARELY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD BUT THEN IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE
YOU1000000131_S0000014	SOMETHING HAPPENED THAT WOULD CHANGE HIS LIFE FOREVER JUST A HUNDRED MILES EAST OF CLEVELAND THE FIRST AMERICAN OIL WELL HAD BEEN DISCOVERED THIS MARKED THE BEGINNING OF THE PENNSYLVANIA OIL RUSH AND WITHIN A YEAR
YOU1000000131_S0000015	FOUR AND A HALF THOUSAND BARRELS OF OIL WOULD BE PRODUCED NOW BACK THEN OIL WASN'T QUITE AS VALUABLE AS IT IS TODAY GASOLINE CARS HADN'T BEEN INVENTED YET BUT OIL COULD STILL BE PROCESSED INTO CAROSEINE WHICH PEOPLE WOULD THEN USE IN LAMPS
YOU1000000131_S0000016	JOHN REALIZED HOWEVER THAT THE BIGGEST PROFITS TO BE HAD WEREN'T IN DRILLING FOR OIL BUT IN REFINING IT HE WITNESSED MANY PEOPLE GOING BUZZ BEFORE STRIKING OIL SO HE KNEW THAT THE BUSINESS WAS TOO RISKY FOR HIM
YOU1000000131_S0000017	INSTEAD HE'D LET OTHERS GO THROUGH THE HASSLE OF FINDING THE OIL AND HE WOULD JUST BUY IT OFF OF THEM JOHN HAD TO WAIT UNTIL ETEN SIXTY THREE FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO BUILD A RAIL LINE CONNECTING THE PENNSYLVANIA OIL FIELDS TO CLEVELAND
YOU1000000131_S0000018	BUT WHEN THAT LINE WAS BUILT JOHN WAS READY FOR IT WITH A LONG LINE OF PARTNERS AND BANKS READY TO BACK HIM UP HE ALSO ASSEMBLED A TEAM OF SEASONED CHEMISTS AND ENGINEERS WHO NOT ONLY OPTIMIZED THE REFINING PROCESS BUT ALSO DISCOVERED VARIOUS USES
YOU1000000131_S0000019	FOR THE BYPRODUCTS OF REFINING PETROLEUM YOU SEE THE EARLY REFINERIES IN CLEVELAND COULD ONLY OPERATE AT ABOUT A SIXTY PERCENT EFFICIENCY BUT JOHN NOT ONLY INCREASED THAT PERCENTAGE HE ALSO STARTED SELLING ALL THE BYPRODUCTS LIKE PARAFINE WAX
YOU1000000131_S0000020	TAR AND NAFTA WITHIN TWO YEARS THE ROCKEFELLER REFINERY WAS WORTH OVER SEVENTY TOUSAND DOLLARS AND WAS AMONG THE LARGEST IN CLEVELAND BUT JOHN WASN'T DONE
YOU1000000131_S0000021	IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE THERE WERE TWENTY SIX COMPETING REFINERIES BUT WITHIN FIVE YEARS JOHN HAD ACQUIRED ALL BUT FOUR
YOU1000000131_S0000023	BY THIS POINT HIS BUSINESS WAS GETTING TOO BIG TO HANDLE AS A PARTNERSHIP SO IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY HE INCORPORATED A STANDARD OIL OF OHIO TO CONVINCE THE FEW REMAINING COMPETITORS IN CLEVELAND JOHN WOULD SIMPLY INVITE THEM OVER AND SHOW THEM HIS BOOKS
YOU1000000131_S0000024	REVEALING THAT HE COULD OPERATE AT A LOSS FAR LONGER THAN THEY COULD STAY SOLVENT IN EXCHANGE FOR A GOOD BUYOUT PRICE JOHN WOULD OFFER HIS COMPETITORS POSITIONS IN HIS OWN COMPANY THUS PLACING THE BRIGHTEST MINES IN THE INDUSTRY UNDER HIS CONTROL
YOU1000000131_S0000025	OF COURSE NOT EVERYONE WOULD GIVE UP IMMEDIATELY AND OVER TIME JOHN ERODED THE PRICE OF OIL AND CARAZINE SOMETIMES BY AS MUCH AS EIGHTY PERCENT IN ORDER TO STRANGLE COMPETITORS UNSURPRISINGLY HIS STRATEGY WORKED
YOU1000000131_S0000026	BY EIGHTEEN EIGHTY HE HAD ACQUIRED REFINERIES ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN U S AND WAS REFINING OVER NINETY PERCENT OF THE ENTIRE COUNTRY'S OIL PRODUCTION AT THIS POINT JOHN WAS SO POWERFUL THAT HE COULD INVITE THE OWNERS OF THE BIG RAIL COMPANIES
YOU1000000131_S0000027	AND PERSONALLY NEGOTIATE REBATES FOR USING THEIR TRAINS BUT THIS PRACTICE OF NEGOTIATING BACKROOM DEALS REALLY GOT THE BUSINESS WORLD RILED UP AT THE TIME AND STILL KIND OF TODAY MOST INDUSTRIAL GOODS WERE TRANSPORTED BY RAIL
YOU1000000131_S0000028	AND MANY BIG INDUSTRIALISTS GOT WORRIED
YOU1000000131_S0000030	THE JAN'S ABUSE OF TRANSPORTATION REBATES COULD RESULT IN SIMILAR MONOPOLIZATION IN THEIR INDUSTRIES
YOU1000000131_S0000031	OVER THE NEXT DECADE BUSINESSMEN POLITICIANS AND THE MEDIA WOULD ATTACK STANDARD OIL WITH INCREASING FEROCITY LEGISLATORS IN OHIO BEGAN DRAFTING ANTI TRUST REGULATIONS TO BRING DOWN ROCKEFELLER BUT HE WAS ONE STEP AHEAD
YOU1000000131_S0000032	IN EIGHTEN EIGHTY TWO HE REINCORPORATED IN NEW JERSEY THIS TIME CREATING THE STANDARD OIL TRUST WHICH IN TURN HELD STAKES IN OVER FORTY LOCAL COMPANIES
YOU1000000131_S0000033	THEN TO SHOWCASE HIS SUCCESS JOHN BUILT AN IMPRESSIVE HEADQUARTERS FOR HIS COMPANY ON BROADWAY THIS MOMENT WAS THE HIGH POINT OF ROCKEFELLER'S STANDARD OIL
YOU1000000131_S0000034	HE OWNED TWENTY THOUSAND OIL WELLS FOUR THOUSAND MILES OF PIPELINE AND EMPLOYED OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE BUT HIS GRIP ON THE OIL INDUSTRY WAS LOOSENING BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND ABROAD
YOU1000000131_S0000035	MASSIVE OIL DEPOSITS HAD BEEN DISCOVERED IN RUSSIA AND IN ASIA AND WERE BEING DEVELOPED BY THE RATHSHELD FAMILY WHICH SPARED NO EFFORT IN GETTING THAT OIL TO AMERICA
YOU1000000131_S0000036	WORSE YET IN EIGHTE NINETY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PASSED THE SHERMAN ANTI TRUST ACT WHICH OFFICIALLY GAVE POLITICIANS THE TEETH TO GO AFTER THE STANDARD OIL TRUST ITSELF
YOU1000000131_S0000037	OF COURSE THE COMPLEX LEGAL STRUCTURE BEHIND ALL THE COMPANIES WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO INVESTIGATE WHICH IS WHY THE GOVERNMENT COULDN'T ACTUALLY BREAK UP STANDARD OIL UNTIL NINETEEN ELEVEN
YOU1000000131_S0000038	BY THAT POINT HOWEVER JOHN ROCKEFELLER HAD ALREADY CASHED IN AND WAS NO LONGER ACTIVELY MANAGING THE COMPANY IN THE FINAL TWENTY YEARS OF HIS COMPANY'S EXISTENCE IT HAD PAID OUT OVER HALF A BILLION DOLLARS IN DIVIDEND
YOU1000000131_S0000039	BY SOME ESTIMATES THE TRUE WORTH OF STANDARD OIL AT ITS PEAK WAS ONE TRILLION DOLLARS SO THE BREAKUP DIDN'T REALLY COME AS A SURPRISE TO MOST PEOPLE IN NINETEEN ELEVEN THE SUPREME COURT FOUND STANDARD OIL GUILTY OF ANTI COMPETITIVE PRACTICES
YOU1000000131_S0000040	D BROKE THE COMPANY UP INTO THIRTY FOUR SEPARATE ENTITIES OF COURSE JOHN ROCKEFELLER KEPT HIS STAKE IN THOSE COMPANIES UNTIL HIS DEATH AND IN FACT IT TURNS OUT THAT THE BREAKUP WAS THE MOST PROFITABLE EVENT IN HIS LIFE
YOU1000000131_S0000041	YOU SEE OVER TIME MANY OF THOSE COMPANIES MERGED BACK WITH ONE ANOTHER TODAY MOST OF THE STANDARD REMNANTS ARE PART OF EITHER EXONMOBIL CHEVRON OR BP WHICH HAVE SINCE BECOME INCREDIBLY LARGE COMPANIES IN THEIR OWN RIGHT
YOU1000000131_S0000042	JOHN ROCKEFELLER'S OWNERSHIP OF THESE SUCCESSOR COMPANIES MADE HIM THE RICHEST BUSINESSMAN TO HAVE EVER LIVED WITH AN ESTIMATED NETWORTH OF FOUR HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS EVEN TODAY NO ONE HAS BEATEN ROCKEFELLER IND THE LEADER BOD
YOU1000000131_S0000043	NOT EVEN GEFF BEZOS HIMSELF SEEMS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE THAT BUT THERE'S ONE THING THAT JEFF BEZOS DOES HAVE THAT JOHN ROCKEFELLER NEVER DID DESPITE ALL HIS MONEY AND THAT IS ACCESS TO DOLLAR SHAVE CLOB
YOU1000000131_S0000044	I MEAN LOOK AT HIM IT'S CLEAR THAT THIS MAN CARES VERY MUCH ABOUT LOOKING AND FEELING AT HIS VERY BEST BUT GUESS WHAT YOU TOO CAN EXPERIENCE THE SPLENDOR OF DOLLAR SHAFE CLUB'S DAILY ESSENTIAL STARTER SET
YOU1000000131_S0000045	WHICH BY THE WAY NEW MEMBERS CAN GET FOR JUST FIVE DOLLARS THAT SET INCLUDES SHAVE BUTTER BODYWASH AND ONE WIPE CHARLIE'S BUTWIPES TO REALLY MAKE YOU FEEL SPECIAL AND IF THAT WASN'T ENOUGH YOU ALSO GET THEIR EXECUTIVE RAZER
YOU1000000131_S0000046	SO REALLY YOU'RE GETTING A HECK OF A DEAL VISIT DOLLARSHAFECLUB DOT COM SLASH BUSINESS CASUAL TO BECOME A MEMBER OF A CLUB SO PRESTIGIOUS THAT NOT EVEN JOHN ROCKEFELLER COULD GET IN

YOU1000000131_S0000048	ANYHOW WE'LL SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN IN TWO WEEKS AND UNTIL THEN STAY SMART
YOU1000000132_S0000000	THE ROTHSHELED BANKING DYNASTY EASILY ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST FAMILIES IN HISTORY BUT ALSO THE SINGLE LARGEST SOURCE OF CONSPIRACY THEORIES
YOU1000000132_S0000001	THE VAST ANDSHROUDED WEALTH OF THE ROTHSHIELDS HAS ENDURED FOR GENERATIONS AND HAS UNSURPRISINGLY MADE IT HARD TO TELL WHAT IS FACT AND WHAT IS FICTION
YOU1000000132_S0000002	IN THIS VIDEO WE'RE GOING BACK TO THE EARLIEST DAYS OF THIS FAMOUS JEWISH FAMILY TO SEE HOW THEY MANAGED TO BUILD ONE OF THE GREATEST FORTUNES IN HISTORY AT A TIME OF RAMPANT ANTI SEMITISM
YOU1000000132_S0000003	THIS VIDEO IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY SKILL SHARE WITH WHOM I'VE PARTNERED TO MAKE A SERIES OF EDUCATIONAL VIDEOS ON THE STOCK MARKET WHICH YOU CAN WATCH FOR FREE BY USING THE LINK IN THE DESCRIPTION OUR STORY BEGINS IN MEDIEVAL EUROPE
YOU1000000132_S0000004	BY THE TENTH CENTURY MOST OF EUROPE WAS UNDER THE DOMAIN OF CHRISTIANITY POLITICAL POWER WAS INVARIABLY TIED TO RELIGION WHICH MADE BEING A NON CHRISTIAN VERY UNFAVORABLE PERHAPS THE BIGGEST VICTIMS OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE THE JEWS
YOU1000000132_S0000005	HAVING NO HOME STATE OF THEIR OWN TO FALL BACK TO THE JEWS WERE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT EUROPE AND MANY OF THEM SETTLED IN THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE
YOU1000000132_S0000006	THIS VAST MULTI ETHNIC STATE CONTAINED MODERN DAY GERMANY AND LIKE THE REST OF EUROPE IT TOO WASN'T HAPPY TO HARBOER THE JEWS
YOU1000000132_S0000007	IN MANY CITIES THE JEWS WERE FORCED TO LIVE IN PARTICULAR NEIGHBORHOODS IN WHAT WE NOW CALL GHETTOS AND THE CITY OF FRANKFORT WAS NO EXCEPTION
YOU1000000132_S0000008	FROM FOURTEEN SIXTY TWO ONWARDS IT CONFINED ALL THE JEWS IN THE CITY TO A SINGLE NARROW STREET OUTSIDE THE CITY WALLS THAT STREET CAME TO BE KNOWN AS THE YUDENGASI OR THE JEWISH ALLEY AND IT WAS MADE UP OF NUMEROUS TIGHTLY PACKED HOUSES
YOU1000000132_S0000009	BACK THEN THE BUILDINGS WEREN'T DISTINGUISHED BY NUMBERS BUT BY SIGNS ONE BUILDING COULD BE THE HOUSE OF THE SHIP FOR EXAMPLE WHILE ANOTHER COULD BE THE HOUSE OF THE GOLDEN STONE THE SIGN ON ONE OF THOSE HOUSES WAS A RED SHIELD
YOU1000000132_S0000010	OR RATH SHILD IN GERMAN AND THE FAMILY LIVING IN THE HOUSE HAD GONE BY THE SAME NAME SINCE AT LEAST FIFTEEN TWENTY EIGHT LIKE MOST JEWISH FAMILIES AT THE TIME THE RATH SHILDS WERE INVOLVED IN FINANCE
YOU1000000132_S0000011	YOU SEE IN MEDIEVAL EUROPE CHRISTIANITY FORBADE ANYONE FROM LENDING MONEY WITH INTEREST LEAVING THIS OTHERWISE PROFITABLE BUSINESS INTO THE HANDS OF THE JEWS EXPERIENCE WITH MONEY LENDING AND BY EXTENSION ANYTHING RELATING TO FINANCE WAS PASSED DOWN GENERATIONS
YOU1000000132_S0000012	AND RATHSHILDS WERE NO EXCEPTION THEY SPECIALIZED IN EXCHANGING CURRENCIES AND TRADING COLLECTABLE COINS AND THE BEST ONE OF THEM ALL WAS MAYER RATHSHILD HE TOOK UP THE FAMILY BUSINESS IN SEVENTEEN SIXTY THREE AND HIS EXTENSIVE COLLECTION OF COINS
YOU1000000132_S0000013	ATTRACTED THE WEALTHIEST ARISTOCRATS IN THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE AMONG THEM WAS CROWNE PRINCE WILHELM OF HES THE PRINCE MET MAYER IN SEVENTEEN SIXTY NINE AND QUICKLY LEARNED TO TRUST HIM WITH ALL MATTERS RELATING NOT JUST TO COLLECTABLE COINS
YOU1000000132_S0000014	BUT ANYTHING FINANCIAL WHEN WELHELM CAME INTO POWER AS WELLHELM THE NINTH OF HES IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FIVE HE HIRED MEYER TO MANAGE HIS FINANCES AS HIS HOFUDE OR COURT JEW NOW KEEP IN MIND THIS WAS A COMMON ARRANGEMENT IN CENTRAL EUROPE
YOU1000000132_S0000015	THE NOBILITY WOULD OUTSOURCE THEIR FINANCES TO JEWS IN EXCHANGE FOR PROTECTION MONEY AND SOMETIMES EVEN ACTUAL NOBLE TITLES MEYER OVERSAW THE TAXES COLLECTED IN WILHELM'S LANDS AND HAD TO KEEP HIS MONEY SAFE
YOU1000000132_S0000016	A TASK THAT BECAME VERY DIFFICULT IN EIGHTEEN OW SIX THAT IS THE YEAR WHEN NAPOLEON INVADED HES DRIVING WELHELM INTO EXILE AND PUTTING HIS FORTUNE AT RISK BUT MEYER WAS SMART AND HE WAS READY FOR NAPOLEON
YOU1000000132_S0000017	IN SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT HE HAD SENT ONE OF HIS FIVE SONS NATHAN ROTHSHOD TO LONDON TO START A CURRENCY BUSINESS SIMILAR TO HIS FATHER'S WITH THIS FOUNDATION IN PLACE MEYER HAD NO TROUBLE MOVING WOHELM'S FORTUNE TO LONDON
YOU1000000132_S0000018	WHERE HE THEN LOANED IT OUT TO THE BRITISH CROWN IN ESSENCE WILHEM WAS FUNDING THE BRITISH TO FIGHT NAPOLEON IN ORDER TO RESTORE HIS POWER NOW MEYER DIED IN EIGHTN TWELVE LEAVING WILHEM'S FORTUNE AND THE ROTHSHIELD LEGACY IN THE HANDS OF NATHAN
YOU1000000132_S0000019	HE REMAINED IN LONDON WHILE HIS ELDEST BROTHER TOOK OVER THE ORIGINAL FRANKFORT BUSINESS MEANWHILE THE THREE REMAINING BROTHERS SCATTERED THROUGHOUT EUROPE ESTABLISHING BRANCHES IN IMPORTANT EUROPEAN CAPITALS
YOU1000000132_S0000020	DESPITE THE DISTANCE THE BROTHERS APPLIED A UNIFIED STRATEGY THEY WOULD LOAN OUT THEIR MONEY TO THE ARISTOCRACY AND TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE BROTHER IN FRANCE FOR EXAMPLE BECAME THE BANKER OF LEOPOLDE THE FIRST OF BELGIUM
YOU1000000132_S0000021	WHILE THE ONE IN VIENNA WOULD LEND MONEY TO THE LAST HOLY ROMAN EMPEROR FRANCIS THE SECOND IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN HE WOULD GRANT ALL FIVE BROTHERS THE NOBLE TITLE OF BARON FINALLY ELEVATING THE ROTHSHIELDS TO NOBILITY
YOU1000000132_S0000022	THROUGHOUT THE NEXT DECADES WHENEVER A EUROPEAN GOVERNMENT COLLAPSED AND WAS REPLACED IT WAS THE ROTHSCHOLDS WHO WERE FIRST IN LINE TO PROVIDE LOANS THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THE FRENCH REVOLUTION OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY OR AFTER THE FALL OF THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE
YOU1000000132_S0000023	THE LOANING BUSINESS WAS IMMENSELY SUCCESSFUL THE PARIS BRANCH FOR EXAMPLE GREW FROM THE EQUIVALENT OF FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY TO OVER HALF A BILLION DOLLARS IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY
YOU1000000132_S0000024	IN ESSENCE THE FIVE ROTHSHIELD BANKING FAMILIES BACK THEN PROVIDED THE SAME SERVICE THAT THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND PROVIDES TODAY THEY STABILIZED MAJOR CURRENCIES AND PROVIDED LOANS TO GOVERNMENTS DOING BOTH AT A GREAT PROFIT
YOU1000000132_S0000026	OF COURSE THROUGHOUT THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THE FIVE BRANCHES ALSO MADE MANY PRIVATE INVESTMENTS BEYOND THEIR GOVERNMENT LOANS IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT THEY PURCHASED ONE OF THE MOST VALUABLE WINE ESTATES IN FRANCE
YOU1000000132_S0000027	IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FIVE THEY ACQUIRED A MINORITY STAKE IN THE SUEZ CANAL FROM EGYPT WHILE IN EIGHTEEN EGHTY THREE THEY FUNDED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FIRST MAJOR OIL WELL IN THE OLD WORLD CHALLENGING THE ROCKEFELLER MONOPOLY IN AMERICA
YOU1000000132_S0000028	THEY ALSO BECAME MAJORITY SHAREHOLDERS IN THE DIAMOND MONOPOLY OF DE BIERS AND IN REO TINTEL ONE OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST MINING COMPANIES BUT DURING THE TWENTIETH CENTURY THE NEWER GENERATIONS OF THE FIVE RATSHIELD FAMILIES MADE FEWER AND FEWER SUCCESSFUL MOVES
YOU1000000132_S0000029	IN NINETEEN HUNDRED THE BRANCH IN NAPLES ACTUALLY BECAME EXTINCT WHEN THE LAST MALE EIR DIED WITHOUT CHILDREN LEAVING HIS FORTUNE TO THE BRANCH IN PARIS A SOMEWHAT AMUSING FATE BEFELL THE BRANCH IN GERMANY
YOU1000000132_S0000030	THERE THE TWO RATHSHIELD AEIRS HAD ELEVEN GIRLS AND NOT A SINGLE BOY SPLITTING UP THE FORTUNE AND DISINTEGRATING ITS POWER THE ROTHSHIELD BRANCH IN AUSTRIA WAS DOING WELL UNTIL HITLER CAME TO POWER OF COURSE
YOU1000000132_S0000031	WHEN NAZI GERMANY ANNEXED AUSTRIA IN NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT THE ROSCRELDS HAD TO SELL THEIR BANKING OPERATION FOR A FRACTION OF ITS TRUE WORTH MOST OF THEM ESCAPED WITH WHATEVER LIQUID ASETS THEY HAD BUT AT LEAST ONE WAS CAPTURED ON HIS WAY OUT
YOU1000000132_S0000032	AND IN FACT HE WAS ONLY RELEASED AFTER PAYING THE LARGEST RANSOM IN HISTORY AT THE TIME TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS THE RANSOM EFFECTIVELY BANKRUPTED THE AUSTRIAN ROTHSCHALS WHILE THE NAZIS SEIZED ALL THEIR MANSIONS BUSINESSES AND ART
YOU1000000132_S0000033	A FEW YEARS LATER EXACTLY THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO THE BRANCH IN PARIS IN FACT THE COLLECTIONS THEY HAD WERE SO EXQUISITE THAT HITLER AND HERMON GURING PERSONALLY WENT THERE TO OBSERVE THEM AND TO PICK OUT WHAT THEY LIKED
YOU1000000132_S0000034	THROUGH THE DETAILED INVENTORIES COMPILED BY THE NAZIS WE KNOW THAT THEY SEIZED A TOTAL OF FIVE THOUSAND AND THREE OBJECTS FROM THE ROTHSHELD COLLECTIONS AND TE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM WERE NEVER RETURNED
YOU1000000132_S0000035	THE FRENCH ROTHSHIELDS HAD SOME LUCK IN RESTORING THEIR BUSINESSES AFTER THE WAR BUT THEN THE FRENCH SOCIALISTS NATIONALIZED THEIR BANK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE IN THE END ONLY THE ENGLISH BRANCH SURVIVED THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WITH ITS FORTUNE INTACT
YOU1000000132_S0000036	ITS PATRIARCH DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WAS SIR EVELYN ROTHSHOD WHO EVEN TODAY IS THE FINANCIAL ADVISER TO QUEEN ELIZABETH HE RETIRED FROM LEADERSHIP IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE PASSING THE MANTLE OF PATRIARCH TO DAVID ROTHSH
YOU1000000132_S0000037	A MEMBER OF THE BRANCH IN PARIS WHO THEN MERGED BOTH BRANCHES INTO A SINGLE ENTITY HE ENSURED THE SECRECY OF THE FAMILY'S FORTUNE BY ESTABLISHING A COMPLEX NETWORK OF SHELL COMPANIES STARTING OFF IN SWITZERLAND BUT ENDING GOD KNOWS WHERE
YOU1000000132_S0000038	BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WHILE THE NINETEENTH CENTURY BANKING FAMILY MIGHT HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE RICHEST OF ITS DAY TODAY DERATHHIELDS ARE A SHADOW OF THEIR FORMER GLORY IN FACT IF YOU OPEN UP THE FORBES LIST OF BILLIONAIRES
YOU1000000132_S0000039	THE FIRST ROTHSHELD APPEARS AT NUMBER EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO THAT'S JEFF ROTSHALD A MAN WHO ACTUALLY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ROTHSHELD BANKING FAMILY
YOU1000000132_S0000040	HE HAS NO BLOOD CONNECTION HE JUST HAPPENS TO SHARE THE NAME IN THE SAME WAY THET TWO MEN BEARING THE FAMILY NAMED GOLDMAN MIGHT NOT BE RELATED THE FIRST ACTUAL ROTH SHOWD APPEARING ON THIS LIST IS ONLY AT NUMBER ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR
YOU1000000132_S0000041	AND HIS WEALTH IS TIED TO AN ASSET MANAGEMENT COMPANY THAT MANAGES OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY SO IN THE END IT TURNS OUT THAT THE ONCE POWERFUL RATSHELD FAMILY IS REALLY NOTHING MORE BUT A BLIP ON THE RADAR OF GLOBAL WEALTH
YOU1000000132_S0000042	AND IT HONESTLY MAKES SENSE STATISTICALLY NINETY PERCENT OF WEALTHY FAMILIES LOSE THEIR FORTUNES BY THE THIRD GENERATION IT'S JUST HARD TO BE FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE WHEN YOU'RE BORN INTO WEALTH AND HAVE NO RESPECT FOR MONEY
YOU1000000132_S0000043	WHY BOTHER LEARNING HOW TO INVEST AND GROW YOUR WEALTH WHEN YOU CAN JUST SPEND WHATEVER GRANDPA LEFT YOU WELL IF YOU WANT TO ESCAPE THIS VICIOUS CYCLE OR AT LEAST KICK THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD FOR ANOTHER GENERATION

YOU1000000132_S0000049	WE'LL SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN IN TWO WEEKS AND UNTIL THEN STAY SMART
YOU1000000133_S0000000	THE INTERNET HAS COMPLETELY CHANGED THE WAY WE WATCH TELEVISION GONE ARE THE DAYS WHEN THE WHOLE FAMILY WOULD GATHER IN THE LIVING ROOM TO ENJOY THE EXACT SAME PROGRAM AS EVERYONE ELSE
YOU1000000133_S0000001	TECHNOLOGY HAS ADVANCED TO THE POINT WHERE WE'VE DUMPED THE OLD IMMOVABLE BOXES IN FAVOUR OF OUR PHONES AND COMPUTERS IN TODAY'S WORLD YOU CAN WATCH WHATEVER YOU WANT WHENEVER YOU WANT ON DEMAND STRAIGHT FROM THE INTERNET
YOU1000000133_S0000002	WE ARE NOW IN THE AGE OF VIDEO ON DEMAND AND SO THIS WEEK ON BEHIND THE BUSINESS WE'LL BE TAKING A LOOK AT THE COMPANY THAT LIES AT THE HEART OF THIS RECENT REVOLUTION NETFLIX
YOU1000000133_S0000004	THE YEAR IS NINETEEN NINETY ONE AND REED HASTINGS WAS GETTING READY TO START HIS FIRST COMPANY HASTINGS WAS A RATHER UNUSUAL TECH ENTREPRENEUR
YOU1000000133_S0000005	HE CAME FROM MINNESOTA AND AFTER GRADUATING FROM COLLEGE AND SERVING BRIEFLY IN THE MILITARY HE DECIDED TO TRAVEL TO SWAZILAND WITH THE PEACE CORE TO TEACH MATH
YOU1000000133_S0000006	AFTER RETURNING TO THE US AND GETTING A MASTERS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE HE AND TWO OF HIS FRIENDS STARTED A COMPANY IN NINETEN NINETY ONE CALLED PURE SOFTWARE THE COMPANY SOLD A RANGE OF DEBUGGING TOOLS FOR UNIX' OPERATING SYSTEMS AT A TIME WHEN THERE WERE FEW GOOD ONES ON THE MARKET
YOU1000000133_S0000007	AND SO IT RAPIDLY BECAME A BIG PLAYER IN THE IT WORLD IT DOUBLED ITS REVENUE EVERY YEAR FOR FOUR YEARS IN A ROW AND IN NINETEN NINETY SIX IT WAS SOLD TO RATIONAL SOFTWARE FOR SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS
YOU1000000133_S0000008	IN THE SPAN OF HALF A DECADE HASTINGS HAD BECOME A MILLIONAIRE
YOU1000000133_S0000009	LIFE SEEMED GREAT BUT IN NINETEN NINETY SEVEN HE SUFFERED AN INCONVENIENCE THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY BECOME A WORLD CHANGER HASTINGS HAD FORGOTTEN TO RETURN HIS VIDEO RENTAL OF APOLLO THIRTEEN AND AS A RESULT WAS SLAPPED WITH A FORTY DOLLARS LATE FEE
YOU1000000133_S0000010	HE WAS EMBARRASSED AND DIDN'T WANT TO TELL HIS WIFE AND THAT GOT HIM THINKING OF A SOLUTION NOT JUST A SOLUTION TO HIS OWN LATE FEE PROBLEM BUT A SOLUTION TO EVERYONE'S PROBLEM AN ENTIRELY NEW SYSTEM OF FILM RENTAL THAT WOULD MAKE LATE FEES OBSOLETE
YOU1000000133_S0000011	TOGETHER WITH A FRIEND OF HIS ON AUGUST TWENTY NINTH NINETEN NINETY SEVEN IN SCOTTS VALLEY CALIFORNIA HASTINGS FOUNDED A BRAND NEW MOVIE RENTAL SERVICE CALLED NETFLIX WITH THE IDEA OF MAILING DVDS TO PAYING CUSTOMERS
YOU1000000133_S0000012	THE CREATION OF NETFLIX WAS ESSENTIALLY A BET ON THE DVD PLAYER NOW THE DVD PLAYER HAD BEEN INVENTED IN TAIWAN IN NINETEN NINETY FOUR BY SONY BUT IT WOULDN'T BE UNTIL MARCH NINETEN NINETY SEVEN THAT ONE WAS FIRST SOLD IN THE US
YOU1000000133_S0000013	BACK THEN A PLAYER COST OVER A THOUSAND DOLLARS AND WHEN NETFLIX WAS FORMED LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF AMERICANS ACTUALLY OWNED ONE
YOU1000000133_S0000014	IN A MOVE THAT SEEMED INSANE AT THE TIME HASTINGS GAMBLED EVERYTHING ON THE POTENTIAL OF DVD TECHNOLOGY TO REPLACE THE BULKIER LOWER RESOLUTION VIDEO TAPE AS THE NATION'S FORMAT OF CHOICE
YOU1000000133_S0000015	IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO RENT DVIDS BECAUSE VERY FEW PLACES HAD ANY
YOU1000000133_S0000016	AFTER TRYING OVER TWO HUNDRED DIFFERENT MAILING PACKAGES AND TESTING THEM OUT BY MAILING THEM TO HIMSELF HASTINGS DISCOVERED THAT HE COULD SAFELY SHIP A DVD FOR THE SMALL COST OF A FIRST CLASS MAILSTA
YOU1000000133_S0000017	THIS WAY NETFLIX COULD GUARANTEE THAT MOST TITLES WOULD BE IN STOCK AND BY ENCLOSING A STAMPED RETURN MAILER THEY COULD MAKE THE EXPERIENCE OF FILM RENTOL AS CONVENIENT AS POSSIBLE
YOU1000000133_S0000018	THUS ON APRIL FOURTEENT NINEEN NINETY EIGHT WITH THIRTY EMPLOYEES AND AN ASSORTMENT OF NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE TITLES NETFLIX OPENED FOR BUSINESS
YOU1000000133_S0000019	THEIR FIRST OFFER WAS FOR A SEVEN DAY RENTAL WITH THE PRICE OF FOUR DOLLARS PLUS A TWO DOLLARS SHIPPING FEE THEY ALSO INTRODUCED SOMETHING THAT IS NOW ONE OF NETFLIX'S PROUDEST HOALEMARKS SMART SUGGESTION ALGORITHMS
YOU1000000133_S0000020	ONCE A CUSTOMER HAD RENTED ENOUGH TITLES NETFLIX COULD AUTOMATICALLY SUGGEST NEW MOVIES THAT WERE LIKELY TO INTEREST THEM NOWADAYS WHEN GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT US IT'S EASY TO TAKE SUCH ALGORITHMS FOR GRANTED BUT IN NINETEN NINETY SEVEN THEY WERE PRACTICALLY UNHEARD OF
YOU1000000133_S0000021	NETFLIX STARTED STRONG AND JUST FORTY EIGHT HOURS AFTER OPENING THEY HAD TO UPGRADE THEIR WEBSITE'S BANDWIDTH DUE TO THE EXCESSIVE TRAFFIC THEY WERE RECEIVING
YOU1000000133_S0000022	SOON NETFLIX SIGNED PROMOTIONAL DEALS WITH TUSHIBA HULET PACKARD AND SONI WHEREBY THEY OFFERED FREE RENTALS TO PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT NEW DVD PLAYERS
YOU1000000133_S0000023	IN JULY NINETEN NINETY NINE NETFLIX SECURED A THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR CAPITAL INJECTION FROM GROUP ARNO WHICH ALLOWED THEM TO START A SUBSCRIPTION BASED SERVICE CALLED THE MARKI PROGRAM
YOU1000000133_S0000024	FOR JUST UNDER SIXTEEN DOLLARS PER MONTH CUSTOMERS COULD RENT OUT AS MANY DVDS AS THEY WANTED AS LONG AS THEY HAD NO MORE THAN FOUR DVDS AT ANY GIVEN TIME NO LADE FEES NO DUE DATES IT WAS PERFECT
YOU1000000133_S0000025	BY THAT POINT NETFLIX WAS ALREADY RECEIVING TEN THOUSAND DVD ORDERS EVERY DAY BUT THEIR TOTAL REVENUE WAS SITTING AT BARELY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS COMPARE THIS TO BLOGBUSTER'S FOUR AND A HALF BILLION DOLLAR REVENUE AND YOU'LL PROBABLY SEE WHY NETFLIX DECIDED TO TRY TO TEAM UP WITH THEM
YOU1000000133_S0000026	BLOGBUSTER WAS ONE OF THE OLDEST VIDEO RENTAL COMPANIES AND IT WAS BY FAR THE LARGEST WITH SIXTY THOUSAND EMPLOYEES AND EIGHT THOUSAND STORES SPREAD ACROSS THE U S
YOU1000000133_S0000027	AS THE POPULARITY OF NETFLIX GREW EVERYONE THOUGHT BLOGBUSTER WOULD SOON ENTER THE MARKET AND WITH THEIR VAST RESOURCES THEY WOULD HAVE PROBABLY CRUSHED THEIR YOUNG COMPETITOR
YOU1000000133_S0000028	THAT'S WHY NETFLIX DECIDED TO ACT FIRST AND SO IN THE EARLY YEAR TWO THOUSAND THEY INVITED BLOCKBUSTER TO BECOME A STRATEGIC PARTNER AND INVESTOR
YOU1000000133_S0000029	NETFLIX WOULD BECOME THE INTERNET ARM OF THE BLOGBOSTER BRAND DROPPING THE NETFLIX NAME ALTOGETHER IN FAVOUR OF BLOGBOSTER DOT COM
YOU1000000133_S0000030	BLOGBUSTER LAFTD THEM OUT OF THE BOARDROOM THEY WERE CERTAIN NETFLIX WOULD CRUMBOW AS IT HAD YET TO TURN A PROPET THREE YEARS AFTER ITS CREATION INSTEAD A FEW MONTHS LATER BLOGBUSTER PARTNERED UP WITH ANRON BROADBAND
YOU1000000133_S0000031	DIVISION OF THE ENERGY COMPANY YOU PROBABLY KNOW TODAY FOR ITS NOTORIOUSLY FRAUDULENT ACCOUNTING PRACTICES
YOU1000000133_S0000033	OF COURSE AT THE TIME NOBODY KNEW THAT AND SO INVESTORS PRAISED BLOGBOSTER'S DECISION THE SITUATION FOR NETFLIX LOOKED GRIM THEY WERE LOSING MONEY FAST AND BY THE END OF THE YEAR THEY REPORTED A NET LOSS OF FIFTYSEVEN MILLION DOLLARS
YOU1000000133_S0000034	DESPITE DOUBTS COMING FROM ALL SIDES HASTINGS WAS CONVINCED THA DVD TECHNOLOGY WOULD PREVAIL THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERED TO HIM WAS TO SIMPLY SURVIVE UNTIL THAT HAPPENED AND TWO THOUSAND AD ONE WAS THE YEAR WHEN THINGS FINALLY STARTED GOING HIS WAY
YOU1000000133_S0000035	THE PRICE OF DVD PLAYERS PLUMMETED WITH SOME GOING AROUND FOR LESS THAN A HUNDRED BUCKS TWO THOUSAND ONE ALSO SAW THE NINE ELEVEN TERRORIST ATTACKS FEARFUL AMERICANS TOOK REFUGE IN THEIR HOMES AND NETFLIX SUBSCRIPTIONS SKYROCKETED
YOU1000000133_S0000036	DESPITE GROWING AT AN UNPRECEDENTED RATE NETFLIX STILL HADN'T TURNED A PROFIT AND SO IN TWO THOUSAND TWO THEY WENT PUBLIC TO KEEP THE COMPANY GOING IN TWO THOUSAND THREE THEY CROSSED THE ONE MILLION SUBSCRIBER MARK AND FINALLY HAD THEIR FIRST PROFITABLE YEAR
YOU1000000133_S0000037	JUST AS THEIR FORTUNES STARTED TO TURN HOWEVER IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR BLOGBUSTERS FINALLY RELEASED THEIR OWN ONLINE DVD MAIL SERVICE BEFORE LONG WALMART ALSO JOINED THE FRAY AND A THREE WAY BATTLE TO UNDERCUT ONE ANOTHER ENSUED
YOU1000000133_S0000038	BLOGBUSTER AND WAMART HOWEVER WERE A BIT LATE TO THE PARTY HASTINGS ADMITTED THAT IF THEY HAD STARTED TWO YEARS EARLIER THEY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE WON ON AN ND OFYEAR CONFERENCE CALL HASTINGS DECLARED BLOCKBUSTER HAS THROWN EVERYTHING BUT THE KITCHEN SINK AT US
YOU1000000133_S0000039	WHEN THE CEO OF BLOGBOSTER HEARD THAT HE PROMPTLY HAD A KITCHEN SINK DELIVERED TO THE NETFLIX OFFICE A FAIRLY CREATIVE WAY OF DECLARING WAR
YOU1000000133_S0000040	AS THE COMPETITORS UNDERCUT ONE ANOTHER NETFLIX SAW ITS BRIEF PROFITABILITY EVAPORATE AND ITS STOCK FELL BY SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT
YOU1000000133_S0000041	DESPITE LOSING MONEY THEY KEPT ON GROWING AND BY TWO THOUSAND FIVE NETFLIX WAS SHIPPING ONE MILLION DVDS EVERY DAY FROM THEIR ASSORTMENT OF OVER THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND TITLES EVENTUALLY THIS DRAWN OUT BATTLE OF ATTRITION TOOK ITS TOLL
YOU1000000133_S0000042	AND IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE WALMART DECIDED TO QUIT BLOGBUSTER FOLLOWED SUIT AND AS THE ERA OF BRICK AND MORTAR VIDEO RENTAL CAME TO AN END SO DID THEIR SUCCESS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE SAME CEO THAT HAD REJECTED NETFLIX WAS FIRED
YOU1000000133_S0000043	BY TWO THOUSAND TEN BLOGBUSTER HAD FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY NETFLIX HAD EMERGED VICTORIOUS AND IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN IT CELEBRATED THE DELIVERY OF ITS BILLIENTH DVD THEN IN A SINGLE ANNOUNCEMENT HASTINGS BEGAN THE JOURNEY OF MAKING THE VERY BEDROCK OF HIS COMPANY OBSOLETE
YOU1000000133_S0000044	THIS WAS HIS END GAME THE REASON HE HAD BEEN WILLING TO SACRIFICE PROPHETS FOR SO LONG AND THE SAME REASON HE HAD PROPHETICALLY CITED BACK IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND VIDEO ON DEMAND
YOU1000000133_S0000046	NETFLIX FIRST STARTED OFFERING STREAMING OF ON DEMAND VIDEOS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND INITIALLY THE SERVICE WAS AT NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE AT FIRST MOVIE RITES WERE HARD TO COME BY AND THE VIDEOS AVAILABLE TO STREAM ON NETFLIX WERE WELL PRETTY AWFUL
YOU1000000133_S0000047	BUT IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND NDEIGHT THEY SIGNED A DEAL WITH PREMIUM CABLE OUTLET STARS WHICH BROUGHT IN SOME HUGE DISNEY AND ZONE LIBRARY RELEASES THE DEAL COST NETFLIX ONLY TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS A PRICE THEY SOON DISCOVERED WAS AN ABSOLUTE BARGAIN
YOU1000000133_S0000048	THE REASON NETFLIX GOT SUCH A GREAT PRICE WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE THE ONLY BIG PLAYER IN TOWN AND PRETTY SOON THEY SIGNED DEALS WITH PARAMOUNT MGM AND LYONSGATE
YOU1000000133_S0000049	NETFLIX WERE ALSO PUSHING FOR PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER BRANDS AND BEFORE LONG THEY WERE FEATURED ON NEARLY EVERY MAJOR ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM ON THE PLANET THEY BUDDIED UP WITH APPLE PLAYSTATION EXBOX NINTENDOWE AND A BUNCH OF OTHER BRANDS
YOU1000000133_S0000050	BY TWO THOUSAND TEN NEARLY THIRTY PERCENT OF ALL NORTH AMERICAN BROADBAND TRAFFIC DURING PEAK HOURS CAME FROM NETFLIX THEY EXPANDED INTO CANADA IN TWO THOUSAND TEN LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AND EUROPE IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE
YOU1000000133_S0000051	TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN TURNED OUT TO BE A YEAR OF HUGE SURPRISES FOR NETFLIX IN RESPONSE TO THE EVER INCREASING COST OF CONTENT STREAMING LICENSES NETFLIX ANNOUNCED THE PRODUCTION OF THEIR FIRST PIECE OF ORIGINAL CONTENT IT WOULD BE A POLITICAL DRAMA CALLED HOUSE OF CARDS
YOU1000000133_S0000052	FEATURING KEVIN SPACEY AND DIRECTED BY DAVID FINCHER NETFLIX MANAGED TO OUTBIT HBO BY ORDERING THE FIRST TWO SEASONS UPFRONT FOR ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN OCTOBER OF THAT YEAR HOWEVER NETFLIX MADE A MUCH LESS SUCCESSFUL MOVE
YOU1000000133_S0000053	THEY INTRODUCED A NEW SERVICE CALLED QUICKSTER WHICH YES IS SPELLED WITH E W IN REALITY THERE WAS NOTHING NEW ABOUT QUICKSTER AT ALL IT WAS BASICALLY THE SPINOFF OF NETFLIX'S OLD DVD RENTAL SERVICE
YOU1000000133_S0000054	THE BRANDING WAS SLOPPY UNIMAGINATIVE AND JUST NOT THOUGHT OUT BUT THE PUBLIC'S RESPONSE TO QUICKSTER WAS EVEN WORSE NETFLIX LOST EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND SUBSCRIBERS IN A SINGLE MONTH AND THREE MONTHS LATER THEIR SHARES HAD LOST TWO THIRDS OF THEIR VALUE
YOU1000000133_S0000055	UNSURPRISINGLY THEY SHOUT QUIXTRER DOWN THE VERY NEXT MONTH BRINGING THE TWO ARMS OF THE BUSINESS BACK TOGETHER THE FIRST PIECE OF NETFLIX ORIGINAL CONTENT WAS LILYHAMMER WHICH AIRED ON FEBRUARY SIX TWO THOUSAND TWELVE
YOU1000000133_S0000056	IT WAS A RELATIVE SUCCESS AND IT PAVED THE WAY FOR THE BIGGER SHOWS THAT WERE TO FOLLOW IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN FIRST AND FOREMOST WAS HOUSE OF CARDS WHICH FIRST AIRED ON FEBRUARY FIRST AND BECAME ONE OF NETFLIX'S MOST ACCLAIMED TITLES
YOU1000000133_S0000057	AIRING THE ENTIRE FIRST SEASON ALL AT ONCE WAS A BOLD MOVE BY NETFLIX AND IT REVOLUTIONIZED THE WAY PEOPLE WATCH TV SHOWS FOLLOWING THE SAME FORMAT CAME ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT IN MAY AND ORANGE ES THE NEW BLACK IN JULY
YOU1000000133_S0000058	NETFLIX CONTINUED TO USE SUGGESTION ALGORITHMS TO KEEP PEOPLE GLUED TO THEIR COMPUTERS WATCHING SERIES AFTER SERIES EACH AVAILABLE IN ITS ENTIRETY ON DEMAND
YOU1000000133_S0000060	THESE ALGORITHMS HAVE BECOME EXPONENTIALLY SMARTER IN RECENT YEARS AND THEY CAN NOW SPOT GAPS IN THE MARKET GIVING NETFLIX AN EDGE IND DEVELOPING NEW SHOWS
YOU1000000133_S0000061	AT THIS POINT NETFLIX CAN CREATE ORIGINAL CONTENT BASED SOLELY ON WHAT THEIR CUSTOMERS WANT BEFORE THEY EVEN KNOW THEY WANT IT
YOU1000000133_S0000062	THAT STRATEGY HAS WORKED OUT MARVELLOUSLY FOR THEM SO FAR AND IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN NETFLIX RECEIVED FOURTEEN EMMI NOMINATIONS NINE OF WHICH WERE FOR HOUSE OF CARDS
YOU1000000133_S0000063	THEY CONTINUE TO CREATE ORIGINAL CONTENT FROM TV SERIES TO DOCUMENTARIES TO MOVIES THOUGH PERHAPS THEIR FAITH IN ADAM SANDLER WITH WHOM THEYARE RELEASING FOUR NEW MOVIES IS SOMEWHAT MISPLACED
YOU1000000133_S0000064	BY THE END OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN NETFLIX WILL HAVE RELEASED SIX HUNDRED HOURS OF NEW ORIGINAL CONTENT FOR THE YEAR AND THEY WILL HAVE SPENT A WOOPING SIX BILLION DOLLARS ON CONTENT ACQUISITION THIS AGGRESSIVE EXPANSION IS THE ONLY OPTION THEY HAVE
YOU1000000133_S0000065	WITH AMAZON AND HULU KNOCKING ON THE DOOR WITH THEIR OWN ON DEMAND SERVICES AND ORIGINAL CONTENT RECENTLY NETFLIX INTEGRATED ITS SERVICE WITH COMCAST'S X ONE PLATFORM A DEAL THAT COULD BRING THEM UPWARDS OF FOUR MILLION NEW SUBSCRIBERS
YOU1000000133_S0000066	IN SUCH A COMPETITIVE MARKET HOWEVER A SINGLE MISTAKE CAN BE DEADLY AND THERE ARE MORE THAN ENOUGH COMPANIES OUT THERE EAGERLY AWAITING NETFLIX'S NEXT TUMBLE IT'S STILL ON TOP AT THE MOMENT BUT THE REAL QUESTION IS HOW LONG CAN IT STAY THERE

YOU1000000134_S0000012	BRENN AND PAGE RESPECTFULLY DECLINED TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM
YOU1000000134_S0000014	SERGA BRINN WAS BORN IN THE SOVIET UNION IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE HIS PARENTS WERE MATHEMATICIANS AND JEWISH WHICH LIMITED THEIR CAREER OPPORTUNITIES
YOU1000000134_S0000016	MARK MALSEED IS THE CO AUTHOR OF THE GOOGLE STORY

YOU1000000134_S0000029	THEY SEE THEMSELVES AS ON A MISSION AND THAT MISSION REALLY DOES SPRING FROM

YOU1000000134_S0000032	YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO WAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF TE NIGHT WITH A VIVID DREAM AND YOU KNOW HOW IF YOU DON'T HAVE A PENCIL AND PAD BY THE BED
YOU1000000134_S0000033	IT WILL BE COMPLETELY GONE BY THE NEXT MORNING I HAD ONE OF THOSE DREAMS WHEN I WAS TWENTY THREE
YOU1000000134_S0000034	WHEN I SUDDENLY WOKE UP I WAS THINKING WHAT IF WE COULD DOWNLOAD THE WHOLE WEB AND JUST KEEP THE LINKS AND I GRABBED A PEN AND STARTED WRITING
YOU1000000134_S0000035	SOON AFTER I TOLD MY ADVISER TERRY WINIGRAD

YOU1000000134_S0000040	IT WAS NINETEEN NINETY FIVE AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY WHEN THE HEADSTRONG OVER ACHIEVERS FIRST MET
YOU1000000134_S0000042	ONE OF THEIR STANFORD PROFESSORS USED TO SAY WELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM WAS THAT SURGAY WOULD JUST BURST INTO MY OFFICE WITHOUT ASKING LARRY WOULD KNOCK AND THEN BURST IN
YOU1000000134_S0000044	IN THE NINETY S SEARCHING THE INTERNET WAS RUDIMENTARY HIT OR MISS OFTEN RETURNING RESULTS THAT WERE USELESS AND THE PROCESS WAS VERY SLOW
YOU1000000134_S0000045	THEN YOU TYPED IN YOUR QUERY YOU DID SOMETHING ELSE WHILE YOU WAITED FOR IT TO GET THE RESULT THEN YOU WENT BACK AND LOOKED A THE RESULTS AND MOST OF THEM WERE COMPLETELY IRRELEAT
YOU1000000134_S0000046	PAGE AND BRIN PUSHED FOR SOMETHING BETTER
YOU1000000134_S0000048	SERGAY'S BIG INTEREST WAS IN TAKING ALL THE PAGES ON THE WORLDWIDE WEB AND TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF IT TRYING TO FIND PATTERNS
YOU1000000134_S0000049	THEY STARTED TO DO A RECORD OF BACKLINKS THEY CALLED THEM
YOU1000000134_S0000051	PAGE NOTICED THAT BEHIND EVERY WEB PAGE THERE WERE HUNDREDS OR EVEN THOUSANDS OF OTHER PAGES THAT LINKED TO IT
YOU1000000134_S0000053	IT WAS A URIKA MOMENT THAT WOULD CHANGE THE SO CALLED INFORMATION AGE

YOU1000000134_S0000071	AND PAIGE AND BRENN DROPPED OUT OF THEIR PHD PROGRAMS TO FOCUS ON ATTRACTING FUNDING FOR THEIR YOUNG COMPANY
YOU1000000134_S0000072	IT WOULDN'T BE EASY INVESTORS LIKE RAM SHARAM WERE SKEPTICAL
YOU1000000134_S0000073	THERE WERE FIVE SEARCH ENGINES AT THE TIME AND SO I SAID MAYBE ANY ONE OF THEM MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN THE TECHNOLOGY THE WORLD DIDN'T NEED A SIXTH SEARCH ENGINE
YOU1000000134_S0000075	GOOGLE JUST DIDN'T FIT INTO THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM OF WHAT A WEBSITE SHOULD DO WHICH WAS TO KEEP USERS FROM MIGRATING TO ANOTHER PAGE
YOU1000000134_S0000076	GOOGLE DID THE UNTHINKABLE IT HELPED USERS EXPLORE THE WIDER WEB

YOU1000000134_S0000116	THEIR FAMOUSLY SPARSE HOME PAGE WAS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED BY SRGAY BRINN
YOU1000000134_S0000117	UNLIKE RIVALS YAHOU AND AOL PAGE AND BRINN REFUSED TO CLUTTER THEIR HOMEPAGE WITH ADS

YOU1000000135_S0000000	SPACEEX AND TESLA YOU WOULD BE HARDPRESSED TO FIND TWO COMPANIES THAT ARE MORE POPULAR TODAY
YOU1000000135_S0000001	AND YET IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT PAST BOTH COMPANIES WERE BASICALLY UNKNOWN AND WERE IN FACT SIMULTANEOUSLY ON THE VERGE OF BANKRUPTCY
YOU1000000135_S0000002	TODAY WE'LL LEARN HOW ELON MUSK DID WHAT NO OTHER AMERICAN CEO HAD EVER DONE BEFORE HE CREATED AND THEN RESCUED TWO COMPANIES AT THE SAME TIME
YOU1000000135_S0000003	AND BROUGHT THEM BOTH TO MULTI BILLION DOLLAR VALUATIONS
YOU1000000135_S0000005	THIS VIDEO IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY AUDIBO AND THE STORY PRESENTED IN IT IS JUST ONE CHAPTER OF ELON MUSK'S AWESOME BIOGRAPHY
YOU1000000135_S0000006	WHICH YOU CAN LISTEN TO FOR FREE AS PART OF YOUR THIRTY DAY FREE TRIAL IF YOU REGISTER WITH THE LINK IN THE DESCRIPTION
YOU1000000135_S0000008	IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS ELON MUSK ACHIEVED WHAT ANY ENTREPRENEUR WOULD DREAM OF ACHIEVING HE SUCCESSFULLY SOLD HIS COMPANY FOR OVER A BILLION DOLLARS
YOU1000000135_S0000009	HE PERSONALLY RECEIVED A HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE MILLION AND NOW THIS IS WHERE MOST PEOPLE WOULD CALL IT QUIT BUT FOR ELAN THIS WAS JUST THE BEGINNING
YOU1000000135_S0000010	HE WANTED TO CHANGE THE WORLD FOR THE BETTER AND ONE OF HIS IDEAS WAS TO SEND A GREENHOUSE TO MARS
YOU1000000135_S0000011	IN ORDER TO BOOST PUBLIC INTEREST IN SPACE EXPLORATION AND HOPEFULLY INCREASE NASA'S BUDGET
YOU1000000135_S0000012	THE IDEA WAS OUTLANDISHLY AMBITIOUS ESPECIALLY BECAUSE ELAN WANTED TO SPEND NO MORE THAN TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ON IT
YOU1000000135_S0000013	NOW AT THE TIME SENDING JUST FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS TO ORBIT COULD EASILY COST UPWARDS OF THIRTY MILLION BUT ELON HAD A PLAN
YOU1000000135_S0000014	HE TRAVELED TO RUSSIA WHERE HE TRIED TO BUY REFURBISHED INTERCONTINENTAL BALISTIC MISSILES
YOU1000000135_S0000015	BUT THE LOWEST PRICE THE RUSSIANS GAVE HIM WAS EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS APIECE ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT ABOVE HIS BUDGET FOR THE ROCKET ITSELF
YOU1000000135_S0000016	ON THE WAY BACK FROM MOSCOW ILAN DID SOME BACK OF THE NAPKIN CALCULATIONS
YOU1000000135_S0000017	HE FIGURED OUT THAT THE RAW MATERIALS USED IN THE MAKING OF A ROCKET WERE ONLY ABOUT THREE PERCENT OF THE FINAL SALES PRICE
YOU1000000135_S0000018	INSTANTLY ELAN KNEW WHAT HE HAD TO DO IF HE WANTED TO SEND ANYTHING TO MARS HE'D HAVE TO BUILD HIMSELF A VERTICALLY INTEGRATED ROCKET COMPANY
YOU1000000135_S0000019	TO THAT END HE READ SEVERAL BOOKS ON ROCKETRY FROM THE COLD WAR AND IN JUNE TWO THOUSAND AND TWO HE INCORPORATED SPACE EXPLORATION TECHNOLOGIES ORE SPACEEX FOR SHORT
YOU1000000135_S0000020	HE THEN SET ABOUT RECRUITING THE RIGHT PEOPLE WHO COULD MAKE HIS VISION A REALITY
YOU1000000135_S0000021	HIS IDEAL CANDIDATE WAS YOUNG SINGLE EDUCATED AND READY TO GIVE UP HIS SOCIAL LIFE FOR SPACEEX
YOU1000000135_S0000022	ILAN'S RECRUITMENT STRATEGY WAS VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD
YOU1000000135_S0000023	HE'D BASICALLY COAL UP ANYONE FITTING THAT PROFILE FROM FRESH AIROSPACE GRADUATES TO THE RISING STARS IN BOWING AND LOCKHEED MARTIN
YOU1000000135_S0000024	AT FIRST PEOPLE THOUGHT ELON WAS MAKING PRANKS BUT WITHIN A YEAR HE HAD ASSEMBLED SOME OF THE BRIGHTEST ENGINEERS IN AMERICA
YOU1000000135_S0000025	TOGETHER THEY WOULD DESIGN ALMOST EVERYTHING FOR SPACEX FROM THE ENGINES AND ROCKET BODIES TO EVEN THE SMALLEST DETAILS LIKE THE CIRCUITRY
YOU1000000135_S0000026	IN MANY CASES THE ENGINEERS COULD BUILD STRONGER AND MORE LIGHTWEIGHT COMPONENTS AT JUST A FRACTION OF THE REGULAR PRICE
YOU1000000135_S0000027	THESE COMPONENTS WOULD BE USED TO BUILD THE MERLIN ENGINE WHICH IN TURN WOULD POWER ILAN'S FIRST ROCKET THE FALCON ONE
YOU1000000135_S0000028	DEVELOPMENT WAS FAR FROM SMOOTH OF COURSE BUT NEVERTHELESS PROGRESS WAS BEING MADE BUT THEN ILAN DECIDED TO UP THE ANTI
YOU1000000135_S0000029	IN EARLY TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR HE PARTICIPATED IN THE FUNDING ROUND OF A NEW ELECTRIC CAR COMPANY CALLED TESLA
YOU1000000135_S0000030	HE PERSONALLY INVESTED A LITTLE OVER SIX MILLION AND IN RETURN BECAME THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMPANY'S BOARD
YOU1000000135_S0000031	RIGHT OFF THE BAT ELON BEGAN APPLYING HIS EXPERIENCE FROM SPACEEX AT TESLA
YOU1000000135_S0000032	THE COMPANY'S LOGO FOR EXAMPLE WAS CREATED BY THE SAME PEOPLE THAT MADE THE LOGO FOR SPACEEX
YOU1000000135_S0000033	AND OF COURSE ELON WAS QUICK TO USE THE SAME AGGRESSIVE HIRING STRATEGY HE USED TO ASSEMBLE THE SPACEEX TEAM
YOU1000000135_S0000034	THIS TIME HOWEVER INSTEAD OF POACHING EMPLOYEES FROM BOWING HE WAS HIRING FROM APPLE
YOU1000000135_S0000035	BEFORE LONG THE TESLA TEAM WAS WORKING ON THEIR FIRST ELECTRIC CAR THE TESLA ROADSTER BACK AT SPACEX ENGINEERS WERE CLOCKING IN SIXTY HOUR WORKWEEKS
YOU1000000135_S0000036	WHILE ILAN WAS PROMISING VERY AMBITIOUS TIMELINES
YOU1000000135_S0000037	IN FACT HIS ORIGINAL ESTIMATE WAS TO LAUNCH THE FALCON ONE IN NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND AND THREE JUST EIGHTEEN MONTHS AFTER THE COMPANY WAS FOUNDED
YOU1000000135_S0000038	OF COURSE THAT ESTIMATE GOT PUSHED BACK AND THE FALCON ONE WOULDN'T LIFT OFF UNTIL MARCH TWO THOUSAND AND SIX
YOU1000000135_S0000039	WHEN IT SPENT A TOTAL OF FORTY ONE SECONDS IN THE AIR BEFORE CRASHING DOWN VIOLENTLY LIKE FOR SPACEX TWO THOUSAND AND SIX WAS A BIG YEAR FOR TESLA
YOU1000000135_S0000040	IN JULY THE TESLA ROADSTER MADE ITS FIRST OFFICIAL APPEARANCE AND RECORDED ONE HUNDRED PREORDERS IN ITS FIRST DAY
YOU1000000135_S0000041	BUT LIKE WITH THE FALCON ONE THE ACTUAL PRODUCTION WASN'T GOING VERY WELL TESLA'S CEO AT THE TIME WAS MARTIN EBERHARD
YOU1000000135_S0000042	UND LIKE ILON HE WAS PROMISING UNREALISTIC TIMEFRAMES AT FIRST THE IDEA WAS TO DELIVER THE ROADSTER IN EARLY TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN
YOU1000000135_S0000043	BUT AN ESCALATING SERIES OF PRODUCTION ISSUES PUSHED THE RELEASE DATE FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY
YOU1000000135_S0000044	IN THE END MARTIN'S MISMANAGEMENT OF THE ROADSTER PROJECT GOT HIM OUSTED FROM THE VERY COMPANY HE HAD FOUNDED LEAVING ELAN IN CHARGE OF EVERYTHING
YOU1000000135_S0000045	WITH FULL RESPONSIBILITY OVER BOTH COMPANIES THE STRESS WAS STARTING TO PILE UP
YOU1000000135_S0000046	ELON WITNESSED THE SECOND FAILURE OF THE FALCON ONE ROCKET WHICH DIDN'T COMPLETE ITS ONLY TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN FLIGHT
YOU1000000135_S0000047	AT TESLA ELAN STRUGGLED FIXING THE MESS LEFT BEHIND BY IBERHARD AND IN FACT THE RODSTER'S PRODUCTION WOULD NOT BEGIN UNTIL MARCH TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT
YOU1000000135_S0000048	BUT THEN THINGS GOT WORSE IN AUGUST ILON LAUNCHED HIS THIRD FALCON WEN
YOU1000000135_S0000050	WHICH NEVER MADE IT TO ORBIT AND THEN JUST ONE MONTH LATER HIS WIFE PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED THEIR DIVORCE
YOU1000000135_S0000051	BOTH OF ILAN'S COMPANIES WERE STRUGGLING TO MAKE A VIABLE PRODUCT AND WERE RUNNING OUT OF MONEY FAST
YOU1000000135_S0000052	IN FACT BY LATE OCTOBER TESLA HAD ONLY NINE MILLION DOLLARS LEFT TO FUND THE ENTIRE COMPANY SALARIES WERE BEING DELAYED AND ELON WAS FACED WITH A CHOICE
YOU1000000135_S0000053	HE HAD ALREADY SPENT SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS ON TESLA AND A HUNDRED MILLION ON SPACEX
YOU1000000135_S0000054	WITH WHAT LITTLE HE HAD LEFT ELON HAD TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO FUND AND SECURE THE FUTURE OF ONE COMPANY OR TO RISK EVERYTHING AND GAMBOL ON SAVING BOTH
YOU1000000135_S0000055	FATE GAVE ILAN LITTLE TIME TO THINK THE FOURTH AND POTENTIALLY FINAL FLIGHT OF THE FALCON ONE WAS APPROACHING
YOU1000000135_S0000056	ON SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT ILAN GOT READY FOR HIS LAST CHANCE TO SURVIVE HE STOOD IN THE SPACE EX CONTROL CENTER IN LA AND WAITED IN SILENCE
YOU1000000135_S0000057	THEN THE ROCKET TOOK OFF AND THE CENTER BURST OUT IN ECSTATIC APPLAUSE SPACEEX HAD FINALLY DELIVERED A WORKING PRODUCT
YOU1000000135_S0000058	THE FALCON ONE BECAME THE FIRST PRIVATELY DEVELOPED ROCKET TO GO INTO ORBIT AROUND EARTH BUT ELON WASN'T IN THE CLEAR JUST YET
YOU1000000135_S0000059	A WORKING PRODUCT WOULD MEAN NOTHING IF THE COMPANY BEHIND IT WENT BANKRUPT
YOU1000000135_S0000060	IN A FRANTIC SCRAMBLE ELAN HAD TO FIGURE OUT FUNDING SOLUTIONS FOR BOTH HIS COMPANIES BEFORE THE END OF TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT AND THE TIMING COULDN'T HAVE BEEN WORSE
YOU1000000135_S0000061	ONE OF THE LARGEST AMERICAN BANKS LEMAN BROTHERS HAD COLLAPSED AND THE GLOBAL ECONOMY WAS HEADING TOWARDS DISASTER
YOU1000000135_S0000062	IN THE MIDST OF THIS ELON WAS RAISING ALL THE PERSONAL FUNDS HE COULD TO SAVE TESLA HE LIQUIDATED HIS FEW REMAINING ASSETS AND EVEN GOT HIS COUSINS TO PITCH IN
YOU1000000135_S0000063	BUT GETTING INVESTORS ON BOARD DOESN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT AND DECEMBER WAS CREEPING IN
YOU1000000135_S0000064	ILON HAD MANAGED TO SCRAPE TOGETHER TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS HIMSELF ANOTHER TWENTY MILLION FROM VARIOUS INVESTORS AND FIFTY MILLION FROM THE GERMAN CAR COMPANY DIMELER
YOU1000000135_S0000065	DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS IT SEEMED AS IF ONLY TESLA WAS GOING TO MAKE IT
YOU1000000135_S0000066	BUT THEN ON DECEMBER TWENTY THIRD ILAN RECEIVED A VERY UNEXPECTED CALL
YOU1000000135_S0000067	NASA HAD AWARDED SPACEEX WITH A ONE POINT SIX BILLIONDOLLARS CONTRACT TO RESUPPLY THE INTERNATIONAL SPACESTATION
YOU1000000135_S0000068	THEN ON CHRISTMAS EVE THE TESLA DEAL WENT THROUGH ILAN HAD SUCCESSFULLY SAVED BOTH COMPANIES FROM BANKRUPTCY
YOU1000000135_S0000069	IN LATER INTERVIEWS HE'D RECALL THESE FINAL DAYS IN DECEMBER IN PAINFUL DETAIL
YOU1000000135_S0000070	BUT I REMEMBER WAKING UP ON THE SUNDAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND THINKING LIKE DAMN THIS IS THECLOSEST I'VE EVER GOTTEN WE
YOU1000000135_S0000071	AND ITWAS LOOKING PRETTY GRIM BECAUSE AT THAT POINT YKNW WE EVEN THOUGH THE FOURTH LAUNCH OF SPACEX HAD SUCCEEDED WE WERE STILL RUNNING OUT OF MONEY
YOU1000000135_S0000072	BECAUSE WE HAD THREE WE HAD THREE FAILURES AND ONLY ONE SUCCESS STILL NOT ENOUGH
YOU1000000135_S0000073	AND THEN THE FINANCING ROUND FOR TESLA HAD NOT CLOSED AND WE HAD ONLY TWO DAYS MAYBE THREE TWO I THINK IT WAS LIKE TWO OR THREE DAYS MAYBE TO CLOSE IT BEFORE CHRISTMAS
YOU1000000135_S0000074	SO I WAS LIKE MAN THIS IS THIS COULD BE A REALLY BAD END OF THE YEAR MAYBE BOTH COMPANIES WILL FAIL
YOU1000000135_S0000075	O REGARDLESS OF THE STRUGGLES ELAN MIGHT BE FACING TODAY IT'S WORTH KNOWING THAT TEN YEARS AGO HE OVERCAME THE IMPOSSIBLE

YOU1000000136_S0000024	WE SAID TO OURSELVES WELL WE'VE SUNK THE BEAST AT LAST
YOU1000000136_S0000026	SEVENTY YEARS AFTER THE SINKING OF THE BATTLESHIP TURPITS HISTORIAN PATRICK BISHOP IS EXPLORING THE NORWEGIAN FORD THAT WAS ITS FINAL RESTING PLACE
YOU1000000136_S0000028	LOOKS LIKE I DON'T KNOW MAYBE ONE OF THE SHIP'S PLATES YOU CAN SEE SOME RIVETING HERE SO THERE'S STILL LITTLE SCATTERED SORT OF MEMENTOS
YOU1000000136_S0000030	OF TURPETS LYING AROUND HERE TODAY AFTER ALL THIS TIME
YOU1000000136_S0000032	PATRICK HAS COME TO NORWAY TO FIND OUT HOW THE RAF'S NINE SQUADRON AND SIX ONE SEVEN SQUADRON THE DAM BUSTERS FINALLY MANAGED TO SINK THE UNSINKABLE BATTLESHIP
YOU1000000136_S0000033	THIS DAY IS ALWAYS COMMEMORATED AS TURPITS DAY BY SIX ONE SEVEN SQUADRON BUT IT COULD BE REMEMBERED IN A VERY DIFFERENT FASHION IT COULD HAVE BEEN REMEMBERED AS THE DAY THAT SIX ONE SEVEN SQUADRON WAS ANNIHILATED
YOU1000000136_S0000034	IT'S AN ENDURING MYSTERY WHY WAS IT THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO GET IN THEIRE BOMB AND GET AWAY WITH NO LOSSES IT COULD HAVE GONE VERY VERY DIFFERENTLY
YOU1000000136_S0000036	SEVENTY YEARS AGO THE TURPITS WAS THE GREATEST SINGLE MARITIME THREAT TO THE ALLIES
YOU1000000136_S0000038	AT THIRTY FIVE MILES AN HOUR IT WAS FASTER THAN ANY BRITISH BATTLESHIP
YOU1000000136_S0000040	ITS EIGHT FIFTEEN INCH GUNS COULD FIRE SEVENTEEN MILES BEYOND THE HORIZON IT COULD SINK YOU BEFORE YOU EVEN SAW IT
YOU1000000136_S0000042	ITS ARMOUR WAS SO THICK THAT CONVENTIONAL BOMBS BOUNCED OFF IT
YOU1000000136_S0000044	AN IMPRESSIVE GIANT OF A SHIP TURPIT WAS BUILT TO BE AS NEARLY UNSINKABLE AS A SHIP COULD BE
YOU1000000136_S0000046	WHEN HITLER LAUNCHED THE TURPITS ON APRIL THE FIRST NINETEE THIRTY NINE IT WAS WORLDWIDE NEWS TEENAGER TONY IVERSON WAS MESMERIZED BY THE FLICKERING IMAGES
YOU1000000136_S0000048	I REMEMBER SEEING ICINAMAR IN YORK WHERE I LIVED SEEING A NEWSREAL OF THIS BATTLE SHIP THIS HUGE THING AI HAD NO IDEA WHEN I SAW THIS FRIMH MY GIRLFRIEND THAT ONE DAY I MIGHT BE LINKED WITH TERPIDTS
YOU1000000136_S0000050	TONY WAS PART OF A GENERATION WHO GREW UP WITH THE ROMANCE OF FLYING
YOU1000000136_S0000051	EVERY YOUNG MAN IN THE WORLD WANTED TO FLY IT DIDN'T HURT SOMETIMES ON A SATURDAY NIGHT WHEN YOU'D COME BACK TO THE LOCAL DANCE
YOU1000000136_S0000052	WHEN YOU HOPED A GIRL WOULD SAY N WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING TODAY YOU COULD SAY OH WELL WEL'S BEEN DICING WITH DEATH IN THE HEAVENS
YOU1000000136_S0000054	TONY NOW NINETY FOUR FLEW SPITFIRES IN THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN HE THEN JOINED THE ELITE BOMBER FORCE THE DAMBUSTERS
YOU1000000136_S0000056	IN NINETN FORTY THREE THE DAMBUSTERS SIX ONE SEVEN SQUADRON HAD BREACHED THE REER DAMS USING INVENTOR BARNS WALLIC'S BOUNCING BOMB THE SQUADRON BECAME THE RAF'S EXPERTS IN PRECISION BOMBING
YOU1000000136_S0000058	A YEAR AFTER THE DAM'S RAID MOST OF THE SQUADRON HAD MOVED ON OR HAD BEEN KILLED IN ACTION IT WAS TIME FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF THE BEST YOUNG FLYERS
YOU1000000136_S0000060	I WAS AT UNIVERSITY AND I DECIDED THAT THE AIR FORCE REALLY WAS FOR ME I MADE THE BIG MISTAKE OF SAYING THAT TWO AND TWO MADE FOUR I SHOULD HAVE SAID FIVE
YOU1000000136_S0000062	AND BECAUSE I SAID FOR I BECAME A NAVIGATOR AND I WAS NOT VERY PLEASED AT THE TONE BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE A PILOT
YOU1000000136_S0000063	I WAS A STUDENT AND I WAS DOING ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING I DIDN'T WANT TO GO INTO THE ARMY I DIDN'T WANT TO GO INTO THE NAVY AND I THOUGHT THE AIR FORCE SOUNDED PRETTY GOOD BUT I WAS ALWAYS A BIT WORRIED ABOUT MY EYES BECAUSE THEY
YOU1000000136_S0000064	THEY WEREN'T AS REALLY AS GOOD AS THEY SHOULDV BEEN SO I JUST LEARN THE LINES THAT THEY WERE THE BOTTOM LINE OR WHATEVER IT WAS THAT THEY WERE BEING ASKED AND REELED THAT OFF AND PASSED THE EI TEST
YOU1000000136_S0000066	WITHIN MONTHS OF JOINING THE DAMBUSTERS THE NEW CREWS IN THEIR LANCASTER BOMBERS WOULD BE FIGHTING IN ONE OF THE MOST INHOSPITABLE ENVIRONMENTS OF THE WAR
YOU1000000136_S0000068	AFTER THE GERMAN OCCUPATION OF NORWAY THE ARCTIC CIRCLE BECAME ONE OF THE KEY BATTLEGROUNDS OF THE CONFLICT
YOU1000000136_S0000069	IN JANUARY NINEEN FORTY TWO HITLER ORDERED HIS BIGGEST BATTLESHIP NORTH TO THREATEN THE ARCTIC CONVOYS DELIVERING ESSENTIAL SUPPLIES TO THE RUSSIANS
YOU1000000136_S0000071	CHURCHILL PROMISED STALIN THAT HE WOULD MAINTAIN THIS LIFELINE WITHOUT IT THE SOVIET WAR EFFORT WOULD COLLAPSE
YOU1000000136_S0000073	IN JUNE NINETEE FORTY TWO THE LARGEST ARCTIC CONVOY OF THE WAR THIRTY FIVE MERCHANT SHIPS SET SAIL ESCORTED BY FORTY THREE WARSHIPS THEY WERE ONLY TOO WELL AWARE THAT THE TURPITS WAS POISED TO POUNCE
YOU1000000136_S0000075	THEPOSSIBILITY THAT IT'S GOING TO PUT TO SEA IS ENOUGH TO CREATE WHAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED I THINK AS PANIC
YOU1000000136_S0000077	THE RUMOUR CAUSED THE ADMIRALTY TO ISSUE A FATAL ORDER
YOU1000000136_S0000079	THE CONVOY IS TO SCATTER THAT MEANS THAT THE ESCORT THIS MASSIVE ESCORT TH THEY'VE GATHRED IS TO RETURN HOME AND THAT THESE MERCHANT MEN ARE BASICALLY ON THEIR OWN THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY DECISION
YOU1000000136_S0000080	ND OF THOSE SHIPS THAT SET OUT ONLY ELEVEN ACTUALLY MAKE IT TO PORT THERE'RE SOME NOT BY TURPITS BUT BY GERMAN SUBMARINES AND AND THE LUFAFA WHO HAVE A FIELD DAY SO WITHOUT FIRING A SHOT
YOU1000000136_S0000081	TURPITS HAD ACTUALLY SCORED AN ENORMOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL VICTORY AGAINST THE ALLIES
YOU1000000136_S0000083	THIS THE BIGGEST ARCTIC CONVOY LOSS OF THE WAR PROVOKED A FURIOUS RESPONSE FROM WINSTON CHURCHILL
YOU1000000136_S0000085	THE DESTRUCTION OF THIS SHIP IS THE GREATEST EVENT AT SEA AT THE PRESENT TIME NO OTHER TARGET IS COMPARABLE TO IT
YOU1000000136_S0000087	WITH ROYAL NAVY SHIPS DESPERATELY NEEDED IN THE FAR EAST THE BRITISH THREW EVERYTHING AT THE TURPITS INCLUDING DIVE BOMBERS MANNED TORPEDOES AND MIDGET SUBMARINES
YOU1000000136_S0000089	IN TWO YEARS THIRTY ONE ATTEMPTS FAILED TO SINC THE PHANTOM MENACE
YOU1000000136_S0000091	SO CHURCHILL CALLED IN THE DAMBUSTERS TO FINALLY FINISH THE JOB
YOU1000000136_S0000093	THEY WOULD HAVE JUST TWO MONTHS TO SINK THE UNSINKABLE TURPITS BEFORE THE ONSET OF THE ARCTIC WINTER
YOU1000000136_S0000095	IF THEY FAILED THE BRITISH NAVY IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC WOULD BE TIED UP UNTIL THE SPRING
YOU1000000136_S0000097	THE DAMBUSTERS WERE TO BE JOINED BY NINE SQUADRON ONE OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED IN THE RAF
YOU1000000136_S0000098	WE WERE CALLED TO A SPECIAL BRIEFING AT WOODHALLS BAR AT OUR FRIEND'S BASE WHERE A THEIR WING COMMANDER FLYING MAN CALLED TATE
YOU1000000136_S0000099	TOOK US INTO A BRIEFING ROOM WHICH HAD BEEN TOTALLY BLACKED OUT SO WE KNEW THAIT WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL
YOU1000000136_S0000101	AND HE WAS A FAIRLY DRAMATIC MAN AND HE ENJOYED HAVING US ALL SIT DOWN AND THEN SUDDENLY DRAWING THE CLOTH OF A MODEL IN FRONT OF HIM
YOU1000000136_S0000102	WHICH WAS OF COURSE THE TURPIS GASP FROM EVERYBODY
YOU1000000136_S0000104	THE BEAST WAS HIDING AT THE NORTHERN TIP OF NORWAY WELL OUT OF THE RANGE OF A DIRECT ATTACK FROM BRITAIN SO THE RAF CAME UP WITH A DARING PLAN
YOU1000000136_S0000106	WE WERE TOLD TO PRACTICE A LOT OF DINGE DRILL WHILE DINGEDRILL WAS THE PROCEDURE FOR GETTING OUT OF AN AEIROPLANE IF YOU HAD TO LAND IT IN THE SEA
YOU1000000136_S0000108	THEY WERE GOING TO ATTACK THE SHIP VIAR THE SOVIET UNION
YOU1000000136_S0000110	ON SEPTEMBER THE ELEVENTH THE TWO SQUADRONS TOOK OFF ON AN UNPRECEDENTED THREE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED MILE MISSION
YOU1000000136_S0000112	THEY FIRST FLEW THE ELEVEN HUNDRED MILES TO RUSSIA
YOU1000000136_S0000114	THEN AFTER REFUELING AND AT THE VERY LIMIT OF A LANCASTER'S RANGE THEY FLEW ON TO BOMB THE TURPITS
YOU1000000136_S0000116	IN THEIR BOMBAYS THEY WERE CARRYING THE NEW BARNES WALLICE DESIGNED TWELVE THOUSAND POUND TALL BOY
YOU1000000136_S0000118	IT WAS A REVOLUTIONARY PRECISION WEAPON IN THE RIGHT HANDS IT FLEW LIKE A DART
YOU1000000136_S0000120	BARNES WALLAC HAS DESIGNED IT SO IT DIDN'T TUMBLE OVER LIKE A BOMB MIGHT IT WAS DROPPED AND FLEW DIRECTLY ONTO THE POINT IT WAS AIMED AT I HOPE
YOU1000000136_S0000121	TALL BOY WAS BEAUTIFULLY DESIGNED IF YOU CAN SAY THAT ABOUT A BOMB IT HAD FINS AT THE REAR SO THAT WHEN IT FELL IT WENT INTO A SPIN THAT MEANT IT WAS FLYING VERY ACCURATELY
YOU1000000136_S0000123	THE RAID WOULD HAVE SUCH PROPAGANDA VALUE THAT A FILM CAMERA WENT ALONG TO RECORD IT
YOU1000000136_S0000125	AFTER A SIX HOUR FLIGHT FROM RUSSIA THE LANCASTERS APPROACHED THE TARGET
YOU1000000136_S0000126	I COULD SEE TURPITS OVER THE FRONT OF MY LANKCASTER AND ABOUT THE SAME TIME I SAW ALL THE SMOKE GENERATORS START UP AND THEY HAD ABOUT TWO HUNDRED PLUS SO THEY FILLED THE FOD
YOU1000000136_S0000127	VERY RAPIDLY WITH SMOKE CUS MY BOMB MMEN SAID IT'S NO OOD SKIP I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING SO WE JUST WE JUST HAD A GO
YOU1000000136_S0000129	MOST OF THE TALL BOYS PLUNGED HARMLESSLY INTO THE SMOKE SCREEN BUT HAVING SURVIVED THIS ATTACK THE TURPITS WAS NOW FORCED TO MAKE A FATAL MOVE
YOU1000000136_S0000130	IN NINETEN FORTY FOUR DESPITE FIVE YEARS OF CONFLICT THE CREW OF THE TURPITS WAS LARGELY IMMUNE TO THE HARDSHIPS OF THE WAR
YOU1000000136_S0000132	HISTORIAN PATRICK BISHOP HAS COME TO TROMSO'S TURPITS MUSEUM LOCATED IN A FORMER GERMAN BUNKER
YOU1000000136_S0000134	HE'S EXPLORING THE DAILY ROUTINE ON BOARD WITH CURATOR LIFE ANEBERG
YOU1000000136_S0000136	SO THIS IS LIKE THE YOR YOUR WEEKLY TOBACCORATION YA YEAH
YOU1000000136_S0000137	BUT UNDER THE CARDONALT
YOU1000000136_S0000138	WHET DO WE
YOU1000000136_S0000139	SOMETHING DIFFERENT
YOU1000000136_S0000140	MY GOSH I THINK WE ALL KNOW WHAT THAT IS DON'T WE
YOU1000000136_S0000142	TOBACCO AND CONDOMS
YOU1000000136_S0000143	HU
YOU1000000136_S0000144	TWO STAPLES OF THE OF THE THE SEAMAN'S EQUIPMENT TE WENT TO SHORE
YOU1000000136_S0000145	THAT IS A CUP O FOR COFFEE FROM THE SHIP TAKEN OUT BY SOME OF THE WORKERS WHO WAS CUTTING THE SHIP AFTER THE WAR
YOU1000000136_S0000146	YEAH SO I MEAN IT'S A NICE BIT OF CROCKERY THAT ISN'T IT LOOKS LIKE THEY LIVE PRETTY WELL
YOU1000000136_S0000148	THE SHIP HAD A CREW OF TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED MEN IT WAS SO LARGE IT RAN ITS OWN BAKERY CINEMA AND POSTOFFICE IT EVEN PRODUCED ITS OWN NEWSPAPER
YOU1000000136_S0000150	WAS TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD WHEN HE FIRST STEPPED ON BOARD THE FORTY TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TONN TURPITS
YOU1000000136_S0000152	WE WE WE WERE YOUNG AND E WE WERE PROUD AND AND THE GORLS LOOKED FOR OUR NICE BLUE UNIFORM YOU UNDERSTAND
YOU1000000136_S0000154	GERMAN TROOPS RETREATED ON ALL FRONTS AND STARVING GERMAN CIVILIANS FACED DAILY ATTACKS ON THEIR CITIES LIFE ON THE TURPITS REMAINED LARGELY UNAFFECTED
YOU1000000136_S0000156	WE HAVE HAD GOOD FOOD AND CLEAN ROOMS CLEAN WASH THREE DAYS IN THE WEEK WE HAVE MEAT
YOU1000000136_S0000157	AND IN THE EVENING WE HAVE A
YOU1000000136_S0000159	BUT IN OCTOBER NINETEN FORTY FOUR AS SOVIET FORCES ADVANCED INTO NORWAY THE TURPITZ WAS MOVED A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILES SOUTH
YOU1000000136_S0000161	IT WAS A FATAL MISTAKE THE SHIP WAS NOW ALMOST WITHIN RANGE OF A DIRECT ATTACK
YOU1000000136_S0000163	THE NEWS ENCOURAGED CHURCHILL TO PILE ON THE PRESSURE
YOU1000000136_S0000165	I CONSIDER THAT EVERY EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE TO ATTACK THIS SHIP EVEN IF LOSSES HAVE TO BE INCURRED
YOU1000000136_S0000167	THE RAF WENT INTO A FRENZY OF ACTIVITY IF THE LANCASTER BOMBERS WERE COMPLETELY STRIPPED OF EXCESS WEIGHT AND FILLED WITH EXTRA FUEL THEY MIGHT JUST REACH THEIR TARGET
YOU1000000136_S0000169	OUR ENGINES WERE CHANGED ANDAN ARMOR WAS TAKEN OUT THE ONE BEHIND THE PILOT'S SEAT WAS TAKEN OUT THE BIG PIECE OF ARMOR PLATING THEY HAD TO REDUCE THE WEIGHT SO THEY TOOK OUT THE MID UPPER TURRET IN ITS ENTIRETY
YOU1000000136_S0000170	THEY TOOK THE GUNS OUT OF THE FRONT TURRET AND REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF AMMUNITION IN THE REAR TURRET
YOU1000000136_S0000172	LOSING WEIGHT INCREASED RANGE BUT THE LANCASTERS NEEDED TO CARRY MUCH MORE ONE HUNDRED OCTANE AVIATION FUEL TO GET THEM TO TRONSO
YOU1000000136_S0000174	THE EXTRA FUEL TANKS WAS A WELLINGTON
YOU1000000136_S0000176	OF TWO HUNDRED GALLONS AND A MOSQUITO TANK OF FIFTY GALLONS ONE ON TOP OF THE OTHER PLACED INSIDE THE FUA LARGE WHERE THE REST BED WOULD HAVE BEEN
YOU1000000136_S0000177	AND IT WAS SO DANGEROUS THAT GROUND CREW HAD TO WEAR PLIMSOLES BECAUSE OF THE DANGER OF A SPARK IF THEY WORE THEIR BOOTS AND THAT WOULD PROBABLY BLOW UP THE WHOLE AIRCRAFT AT LEAST ONE PERHAPS SEVERAL MORE AROUND IT AS WELL
YOU1000000136_S0000178	I HAVE TO SAY THAT DESPITE ALL THE FUEL JOINTS BEING THOROUGHLY TIGHT AND NO SIGN OF ANY LEEKAGE YOU STILL COULD SMELL THAT HUNDRED OCTANE
YOU1000000136_S0000179	SO IT MAKDES YOU FEEL A LITTLE BIT SICK I SUPPOSE
YOU1000000136_S0000181	ON OCTOBER THE TWENTY NINTH NEEN FORTY FOUR THE REFITTED LANCASTERS OF SIX ONE SEVEN AND NINE SQUADRONS TOOK OFF ON A THIRTEEN HOUR NONSTOP MISSION
YOU1000000136_S0000183	TO SUCCEED THE UNDEFENDED PLANES NEEDED TO TAKE THE TURPITS BY SURPRISE
YOU1000000136_S0000185	THEY CROSSED THE NORWEGIAN COAST WHERE THEY KNEW THERE WAS A GAP IN ENEMY RADAR AND THEY USED NEUTRAL SWEDEN TO DISGUISE THEIR APPROACH
YOU1000000136_S0000187	EVERYTHING WAS IN PLACE TO FINALLY SEND THE TURPITS TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA
YOU1000000136_S0000189	BUT THE ONE THING NOT IN THEIR CONTROL WAS THE WEATHER
YOU1000000136_S0000191	JUST THIRTY SECONDS BEFORE BOMBING COMMENCED TURPITZ WAS COVERED BY A BLANKET OF LOW CLOUD
YOU1000000136_S0000193	BUT MOST PEOPLE DIDN'T BOMB BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T SEE THE TURPETS VERY DISAPPOINTING ALL THAT PREPARATION AND ALL THAT HARD WORK AND ALL THAT FLYING
YOU1000000136_S0000194	AND TO ARRIVE TOGETHER AT THE RIGHT TIME OVER THE RIGHT POINT AND THEN TO BE WASTED IS I WON'T SAY DISHEARTENING BECAUSE WE WEREN'T DISHEARTNWE ANNOYED PERHAPS
YOU1000000136_S0000196	BUT AFTER THE FAILURE OF THIS RAID THERE WAS TO BE NO LETUP THE CREWS WERE ORDERED BACK AGAIN
YOU1000000136_S0000198	THERE WAS NO TIME TO PLAN A NEW ROUTE AND THERE WAS ONE MORE SHOCK IN STORE FOR THEM
YOU1000000136_S0000199	THEY SAID SORRY TO TELL YOU CHAPS BUT SINCE THE LAST TRIP THE GERMANS HAVE MOVED TWO SQUADRONS OF FIGHTERS TO BE NEAR THE TURPITS
YOU1000000136_S0000201	N NO WAY
YOU1000000136_S0000202	A WELL THIS MADE US SWALLOW A LITTLE BIT
YOU1000000136_S0000203	WE WERE A LITTLE APPREHENSIVE BECAUSE OF COURSE WE HADN'T GOT THE MID UPPER TURRET BUT
YOU1000000136_S0000205	BUT NEW EVIDENCE HAS EMERGED THAT SUGGESTS THE DAMBUSTERS AND NINE SQUADRON WERE IN EVEN GREATER DANGER THAN THEY EVER IMAGINED
YOU1000000136_S0000207	IN NOVEMBER NINETEEN FORTY FOUR THE RAF WAS PREPARING TO ATTACK THE BATTLESHIP TURPITS FOR THE THIRD TIME IN TWO MONTHS THE BRITISH WERE STILL HOPING TO TAKE THE NAZIS BY SURPRISE EVEN THOUGH THEY'D BE FLYING THE SAME ROUTE
YOU1000000136_S0000209	BUT NEW EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THE GERMANS MAY HAVE BEEN EXPECTING THEM
YOU1000000136_S0000211	ON THE NORWEGIAN ISLAND OF ANDOA HISTORIAN PATRICK BISHOP IS INVESTIGATING A STORY THAT THE GERMANS REPOSITIONED SOME OF THEIR RADAR BEFORE THE THIRD RAID
YOU1000000136_S0000213	PATRICK HAS COME TO THE SITE OF A VASEMAN RADAR INSTALLATION THE MOST POWERFUL GERMAN RADAR OF THE CONFLICT HE'S WITH LOCAL RESIDENT JOHN RONALD NORHEIM WHO WAS BROUGHT ALONG A PHOTOGRAPH HIS FATHER TOOK AT THE END OF THE WAR
YOU1000000136_S0000215	HITLER HAD THIS OBSESSION WITH THE IDEA THAT THERE WERE THE ALLIES EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE SURE NORMANDY LANDINGS HAD GONE AHEAD HE STILL CLUNG TO THIS BELIEF THAT THEREOULD BE AN ALLIED LANDING IN NORWAY AS WELL
YOU1000000136_S0000216	ATWAS I WAS
YOU1000000136_S0000217	I WAS TOLD THAT ISRALA WAS PICKING UP ALL THETHE SHIP TRAFFIC GOING TOWARDS RUSSIA
YOU1000000136_S0000218	NOW IF WE LOOK AT THIS PICTURE HERE WE'VE GOT THIS LANDMARK WHICH IS THIS VERY PROMINENT
YOU1000000136_S0000219	ROCKY ISLAND JUST BEHIND US AND YOU CAN SEE WE THAT IN THE BOTTOM RIGHT HAND CORNER OF THE PICTURE ND THIS BOX STRUCTURE THAT'S ON THE BACK OF THE SCAFFOLDING IF YOU LIKE IS ACTUALLY THE REAR OF THE RADAR SET SO THAT WOULD MEAN THAT THE
YOU1000000136_S0000220	THTHE THING IS ACTUALLY THE VASAMIN IS POINTING INLAND IT'S NOT POINTING OUT TO SEA WHERE YOU MIGHT EXPECT IT TO BE
YOU1000000136_S0000221	AHTHIS IS VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR THE VASSAMAN RADAR TO ACTUALLY PICK UP THE THE RAID AS IT CAME AND AS IT HOMED IN ON DONZO TO BOMB THE TURPITS
YOU1000000136_S0000223	WITH THE RADAR REPOSITIONED TO TRACK THE FLIERS COMING FROM INLAND ALL IT NEEDED WAS ONE PHONE CALL TO THE FIGHTER SQUADRON AT BARDAFOS
YOU1000000136_S0000225	IN JUST THIRTEEN MINUTES THE FIGHTERS WOULD BE SWARMING AROUND THE TURPITS READY TO SHOOT THE LANCASTERS OUT OF THE SKY
YOU1000000136_S0000227	ONE OF THOSE CRACK FIGHTER PILOTS AT BARDIFOS NOW LIVES HALFWAY ROUND THE WORLD IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
YOU1000000136_S0000229	KURT SCHULTZ AGED NINETY TWO MEETS WITH A GROUP OF VETERAN FLYERS EVERY WEEK
YOU1000000136_S0000231	SEVENTY YEARS AGO HE WOULDN'T HAVE HESITATED TO SHOOT THEM DOWN
YOU1000000136_S0000233	THE FRIENDSHIP THAT HAS DEVELOPED AND I'M SO GRATEFUL FOR THAT BECAUSE I WAS THE ENEMY
YOU1000000136_S0000235	KURT STARTED THE WAR AS A NAVIGATOR ON BOMBING RAIDS OVER ENGLAND
YOU1000000136_S0000237	BUT LATER HE BECAME A FIGHTER PILOT HE WAS POSTED TO A SQUADRON OF FIGHTER ACES BASED DEEP INSIDE THE ARCTIC CIRCLE HE WASN'T PREPARED FOR THEIR RELAXED ATTITUDE TO DISCIPLINE
YOU1000000136_S0000239	I ARRIVED JUST A FEW DAYS AFTER THEY HAD TRIED TO KILL HITLER AND YOU KNOW THE THE THE SALUTE WAS LIKE THAT
YOU1000000136_S0000241	ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY ALL WALKED IN AND INSTEAD OF GREETING LIKE THAT THEY GREETED LIKE THAT YOU KNOW I TAOG CHEEK HURD WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU SO BUT IT WAS A VERY LOOSE PUNGE
YOU1000000136_S0000242	AS FAR AS REAL DISCIPLINE WAS CONCERNED BUT THEY WERE VERY VERY SUCCESSFUL
YOU1000000136_S0000244	KURT FLEW SIXTY THREE MISSIONS AND HAD THREE CONFIRMED KILLS SOME OF HIS COLLEAGUES AT BARDAFOSS WERE AMONG THE HIGHEST SCORING ACES OF THE WAR
YOU1000000136_S0000246	HE HAD ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE VICTORIES AND I THINK CAPTAIN DUR WHO WAS A GROUP COMMANDER HAD MAYBE A HUNDRED AND SIXTY
YOU1000000136_S0000248	THESE THREE TOGETHER HAD SIX HUNDRED VICTORIES ALMOST
YOU1000000136_S0000250	AS THE LANCASTERS TOOK OFF IN THE EARLY HOURS OF NOVEMBER THE TWELFTH FROM THE FROZEN COAST LINE OF NORTHERN SCOTLAND THE FIGHTERS AT BARDAFOSS WERE PRAYING ON THEIR MINDS
YOU1000000136_S0000252	THIS WOULD BE THEIR LAST CHANCE TO SINK THE TURPITS BEFORE THE ONSET OF THE ARCTIC WINTER
YOU1000000136_S0000254	IT WAS COLD BUT WHEN YOU'RE TWENTY TWENTY ONE YOU MARY YOU DON'T FEEL THE COLD THE SAME BUT IT WAS COLD IF WE WANTED TO HAVE A PE SOME KIND WAFF
YOU1000000136_S0000255	IN THE MESS AT LAST HEHD PROVIDED MILK BOTTLES AND OF COURSE THERE WERE THI OD JOKE ABOUT THOSE
YOU1000000136_S0000257	LOOKING BACK THEY JUST PITCHED US INTO IT AS IT WERE THERE'S THE TARGET YOU'VE GOT THE WEAPON GO AND GO AND DO IT AND AT THE TIME WE JUST GOT ON AND DID IT THAT
YOU1000000136_S0000259	THAT WAS OUR JOB
YOU1000000136_S0000260	IT WAS A LONG LONG JOURNEY THERE WAS NO RADIO CONTACT OF COURSE THE ONLY WAY WE COULD NAVIGATE I COULD NAVIGATE ANYHOW WAS TAKE THE ODD SHOT OF WHICHEVER STAR WAS APPROPRIATE
YOU1000000136_S0000261	AND JUST KEEP MY FINGERS CROSSED
YOU1000000136_S0000263	AT SEVEN A M THE BOMBERS TURNED EAST THROUGH WHAT THEY STILL BELIEVED WAS A RADAR GAP BUT GERMAN RECORDS SHOW THEY HAD ALREADY BEEN SPOTTED
YOU1000000136_S0000264	DEFENSELESS LADEN WITH FUEL AND WITH TWO AND A HALF TONS OF HIGH EXPLOSIVES INSIDE THEIR TALLBOY BOMBS THEY WERE EXTREMELY VULNERABLE
YOU1000000136_S0000265	WE FOUND WE WERE FLYING INTO A GIN CLEAR SKY WHICH AWHICH WAS PERFECT FOR OUR JOB ABSOLUTELY BUT THEN A LITTLE THOUGHT CAME WELL IT'S IT'S PRETTY IT'LL SUIT THE FIGHTERS PRETTY WELL TOO
YOU1000000136_S0000267	AT SEVEN FORTY THE LANCASTERS BEGAN THEIR RUN INTO THE TARGET FROM NEUTRAL SWDE
YOU1000000136_S0000269	THE TURPITS WAS ALREADY RECEIVING INFORMATION OF CONFUSED SIGHTINGS SOME PLACING BOMBERS ON A COURSE TO RUSSIA OTHERS PLACING THEM A HUNDRED KILOMETERES TO THE NORTH
YOU1000000136_S0000271	NO ONE ALERTED THE BARDAFOS AIRBASE
YOU1000000136_S0000273	THEN AT EIGHT O NINE THE TURPITS ON ITS OWN RADAR SPOTTED THE BOMBER FORCE JUST THIRTY MINUTES AWAY AND IT WAS COMING STRAIGHT AT THEM
YOU1000000136_S0000275	THE ALARM FINALLY SOUNDED AT THE BARDAFOS FIGHTER BASE AT EIGHT EIGHTEEN THIS WAS MORE THAN AN HOUR AFTER THE RAIDERS HAD FIRST BEEN SPOTTED
YOU1000000136_S0000277	SIX MINUTES LATER THE LANCASTERS PASSED A FEW MILES TO THE EAST OF BARDIFOS ON THEIR WAY NORTH
YOU1000000136_S0000279	MINE THOUGHT WAS HOPE TO CRUSH THE FIGHTERS ON'T GET NEAR US IF I GOT A ONE ONE O NINE UP MY BACKSIDE AND THEREWULD BE VERY LITTLE LEFT FOR ME FINISHED WITH US WITH HIS CANNON
YOU1000000136_S0000281	AT EIGHT THIRTY KURT SHULTZ ARRIVED AT HIS MESSHESMITH ONE OW NINE FIGHTER HAD HE TAKEN OFF THEN HE COULD STILL HAVE CAUGHT THE LANCASTERS BUT KURT AND HIS COLLEAGUES LOST VITAL MINUTES GETTING OFF THE GROUND
YOU1000000136_S0000283	FOR A START THE PLANES WERE AT THE WRONG END OF THE RUNWAY AND THEN AT THE MOMENT THEY WERE READY TO TAKE OFF AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL ALLOWED A TRANSPORT PLANE TO LAND
YOU1000000136_S0000285	SO THE LHAT'S THI OU FIFTY TWO THAT WAS COMING FLY IN AND LAND DOWN THE HILL AND SO THERE AS ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES LOST
YOU1000000136_S0000289	JUST BEFORE EIGHT THIRTY A M THE LANCASTERS BEGAN THEIR APPROACH TO THE TURPITS RAF CAMERAS WERE AGAIN ON HAND TO FILM IT ALL SO FAR THERE WAS STILL NO SIGN OF KURT AND HIS FIGHTERS
YOU1000000136_S0000291	IT WAS A SUNDAY YES I WAS STANDING ON THE DECK THEN CAME THE ALARM
YOU1000000136_S0000292	AND WE SAW THE MACHINE IN SOUTH
YOU1000000136_S0000294	AS THE LANCASTERS APPROACHED THEY WERE CONFRONTED BY THE FIRST OF TURPITZER'S FORMIDABLE WEAPONRY THE SHIP TRAINED ITS MASSIVE FIFTEEN INCH GUNS ONTO THE RAIDERS EACH SHELL WEIGHED MORE THAN A TONN
YOU1000000136_S0000296	THE TURPITS GUNS HAD A RANGE OF SEVENTEEN MILES EVEN THE BIG HEAVY GUNS COULD BE ELEVATED TO REACH AIRCRAFT
YOU1000000136_S0000298	IT WAS A GREAT UNFOLDING ORANGE CLOUD THIS FIFTEEN INCH SHELL WENT OFF WOULD HAVE PROBABLY TAKEN TWO LANCASTERS OUT OF THE SKY TOGETHER
YOU1000000136_S0000300	YOU COULD ACTUALLY SEE THESE SHELLS COMING UP THEY SEEMED TO COME UP SO SLOWLY IT WAS A FASCINATING SIGHT YOUU NEVER SEE ANYTHING LIKE IT AGAIN
YOU1000000136_S0000302	WITHIN A MINUTE THE REST OF TURPITZER'S DEFENSES OPENED UP ON THE ADVANCING BOMBERS
YOU1000000136_S0000304	MY COMBAT STATION WAS THE ANTI AIR GUN
YOU1000000136_S0000305	YOU HAVE TO TAKE YOUR HAT OFF TO THE GERMAN GUNNERS THEY'D GOT THE ALTITUDE ABSOLUTELY COCK ON I MEAN WE WERE FIFTEEN THOUSAND T HUNDRED FEET AND THE FLAK WAS BURSTING EXACTLY AT THAT LEVEL
YOU1000000136_S0000306	BUT WE WERE FORTUNATE THAT THEY WERE A LITTLE BIT EARLY THTHE FLAK WAS IN FRONT OF US BY A MATTER OF A FEW YARDS
YOU1000000136_S0000307	WHEN THE FUEL IN A TWO HUNDRED GALLON TANK IS USED UP THAT'S WHEN IT BECOMES DANGEROUS BECAUSE SHOULD A BIT OF FLAT GET THROUGH IT'S GOING TO HIT SORT OF VAPORISED FUEL
YOU1000000136_S0000308	HOW DO YOU FEEL YOUI MUST ADMIT U YOU'RE A BIT EXCITED AND THINK CHRIST HOPE THEY DON'T HIT US
YOU1000000136_S0000309	I HAD TO GET THAT AEROPLANE POSITIONED SO THE BOMB WENT DOWN TO HIT THIS TARGET WHICH FROM FIFTEEN THOUSAND FEET MUST HAVE LOOKED TO MY BOMB EO LIKE A DINKY TOY EVEN THOUGH IT WAS NINE HUNDRED FEET LNG
YOU1000000136_S0000311	THE FIRST TALLBOY WAS RELEASED AT EIGHT FORTY ONE IT'S CARLED A DIRECT HIT
YOU1000000136_S0000313	THE NEXT FIVE RECORDED ANOTHER DIRECT HIT THREE NEAR MISSES AND A STRAY
YOU1000000136_S0000315	YEAH YOU COULD SEE IT GO DOWN LIKE A DART ALMOST BCAUSE IT WAS PAINTED BRIGHT GREEN YEAH OU AND IT LOOKED QUITE NICE ACTUALLY DIVING DOWN THERE
YOU1000000136_S0000316	IT WENT THROUGH THE SPEED OF SOUND SO WHAT THESE POOR SAILORS FELT WHEN ONE OR TWO OF THEM LANDED WHEN THE MACHINE COME ARE COMING AGAINST YOU YOU HAVE
YOU1000000136_S0000317	YOU CANNOT GET AIR ENOUGH IT'S SO AS ONE PRESSED UYOUR YOUR AIR
YOU1000000136_S0000319	AFTER THE FIRST WAVE OF SIX BOMBERS TONY IVERSON WAS IN THE SECOND WAVE OF THREE HE ATTACKED AT EIGHT FORTY TWO
YOU1000000136_S0000320	I BOMBED AT NUMBER SEVEN OR NUMBER EIGHT AND I THINK I HAD A NEAR MISS OR A NOT NEAR MISS I'M NOT SURE I'VE NEVER I CAN'T GO FURTHER THAN THAT
YOU1000000136_S0000322	THIS SECOND WAVE SCORED TWO VERY NEAR MISSES THE BOMBS WERE BEGINNING TO OVERWHELM THE SHIP
YOU1000000136_S0000324	THE FIRST BOMB HAD LANDED MIDSHIPS IT LED TO ONE OF THE MAGAZINES BLOWING UP BOMB FOUR HAD HIT CLOSE TO A TURRET AND BLEW IT INTO THE AIR BOMBS FIVE SEVEN NINE AND FOURTEEN
YOU1000000136_S0000325	HAD LANDED CLOSE BY THESE ALSO HAD A DEVASTATING EFFECT PRODUCING SHOCK WAVES THAT BUCKLED THE SHIP'S FRAME AND CAUSED IT TO START TO CAPSIZE
YOU1000000136_S0000327	THE FIRST NINE AIRCRAFT BOMBED IN ONE AND A HALF MINUTES THAT'S NINETY SECONDS YOU CAN COUNT NINETY SECONDS JUST THINK OF NINE FIVE TON BOMBS COMING DOWN AT YOU
YOU1000000136_S0000329	NINE SQUADRON FOLLOWED UP DROPPING THEIR TALLBOYS INTO THE SMOKE AS THEY EXPLODED FEW WERE CERTAIN OF THE OUTCOME
YOU1000000136_S0000331	THERE WAS SMOKE UP AT THE ONE END AFTWARS IT WAD BEEN TH THE POINTED BEND I THINK
YOU1000000136_S0000332	BUT THE RIG ANE WAS QUITE CONVINCED NAUGHTY THING'S GOING OVER SKIT
YOU1000000136_S0000334	AS THE LANCASTERS TURNED AWAY FROM THE TARGET THEY KNEW THE DANGER WASN'T OVER YET
YOU1000000136_S0000336	WE REALIZED WE HADN'T SEEN ANY FIGHTERS WHICH IS
YOU1000000136_S0000338	AMAZING AMAZING LUCK
YOU1000000136_S0000340	THEY WERE LUCKIER THAN THEY COULD HAVE IMAGINED THE FIRST GERMAN FIGHTERS WERE LESS THAN THREE MINUTES AWAY AS THE LAST BOMB WAS DROPPED
YOU1000000136_S0000342	IT TOOK ME APPROXIMATELY TEN MINUTES TO GET TTROMZIV FROM BARDAFOS AND WHEN I ARRIVED THERE THE TURPANS WAS ALREADY TURNING OVER
YOU1000000136_S0000344	SO I TURNED AROUND AND FLEW BACK THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO
YOU1000000136_S0000346	KURT HAD ONLY JUST MISSED THE DEFENSELESS LANCASTERS ALL THE CREWS RETURNED HOME SAFELY WAS IT LUCK OR WERE THERE OTHER FORCES AT WORK
YOU1000000136_S0000348	THE SINKING OF THE BATTLESHIP TURPITS AFTER THIRTY THREE FAILED ATTEMPTS WAS A REMARKABLE FEAT OF NAVIGATION FLYING AND PRECISION BOMBING BUT IT HAD A TERRIBLE HUMAN COST
YOU1000000136_S0000350	SEVENTEEN HUNDRED SAILORS WERE ON BOARD AS THE SHIP BEGAN TO CAPSIZE
YOU1000000136_S0000352	I SAW NOT THE EXPLOSION FROM THE HIT ON THE SHIP BUT I FEEL THE QUAKE YOU HAVE YOU YOU ARE FEELING THAT THE SHIP MAKE A JUMP FROM A HALF METER
YOU1000000136_S0000353	AND IN THE NEXT MOMENT THE SHIP BEGAN TO CAPSIZE IT GOES SO AND SO THE AND AND AT LAST WE HANGING IN THE RAINING HERE
YOU1000000136_S0000354	AND I GO A MOMENT LATER INTO THE WATER YES AND THEN I SWIM TO THE COASTLINE AND THE WATER WAS OIL AND
YOU1000000136_S0000356	MANY OF THE
YOU1000000136_S0000358	THEY HAVE THEIR FACE IN THE WATER THE AR DIE AND IT LOOKD I SEE T T WAS CRAZY IT IT IT LOOKS AS AS WHEN
YOU1000000136_S0000359	FOOTBALLS WARE SWIMMING IN THEI THE BOT A CRAZY SIGHT
YOU1000000136_S0000361	VILIBALT VELSING WAS BELOW DECKS WHEN THE SHIP CAPSIZED
YOU1000000136_S0000363	TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD KARL HEINZ ERSLING WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE ON SHORE AT THE TIME OF THE ATTACK
YOU1000000136_S0000365	HE RUSHED TO THE RESCUE OF THE HUNDREDS OF SAILORS TRAPPED INSIDE THE HULL
YOU1000000136_S0000367	AS THE TIDE ROSE THE COMPARTMENTS BEGAN TO FILL WITH WATER THE RESCUERS COULD HEAR THEIR ENTOMED COMRADES SINGING DOICHLAND UBAR ALIS UNTIL THE VOICES FELL SILENT
YOU1000000136_S0000369	NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE SAILORS LOST THEIR LIVES BUT THE BEAST HAD BEEN SLAIN
YOU1000000136_S0000371	E LOOKING BACK IT'S QUITE REMARKABLE THAT THE RAIDERS MANAGED TO GET AWAY WITH IT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT IT'S THE DEFENDERS WHO'VE ACTUALLY GOT THE ODDS
YOU1000000136_S0000372	STACKED IN THEIR FAVOUR YOU'VE GOT A SQUADRON FOF CRACK FIGHTERS BASED NEARBY
YOU1000000136_S0000374	APPARENTLY WITH THE SPECIFIC JOB OF LOOKING AFTER THE TURPITS YOU'VE GOT THE RADAR SYSTEMS APPARENTLY POINTING INWARDS YET THERE WE ARE AT THE END OF THAT MORNING THE TURPITS IS SUNK
YOU1000000136_S0000375	AND THE ATTACKERS HAVE GOT AWAY WITH IT VIRTUALLY SCOTFREE NOW MAYBE IT WAS JUST SHEER GOOD LUCK BUT I'VE OFTEN THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS THERE'S ANOTHER EXPLANATION FOR WHAT HAPPENED
YOU1000000136_S0000377	ON THE ISLAND OF VANDOA PATRICK IS FOLLOWING A NEW LEAD THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN WHY THE GERMAN FIGHTERS WEREN'T SCRAMBLED IN TIME
YOU1000000136_S0000379	HE'S MEETING LOCAL RESIDENT JOURNALIST SANDER PETERSON AS A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD BOY SCHOOLBOY SANDA WORKED IN THE ENDOA RADAR BASE FOR A GERMAN OFFICER LIEUTENANT CARL HEINRICK VESNER
YOU1000000136_S0000381	VESNA WAS A KEY LINK IN THE RADAR COMMUNICATION NETWORK ON THE ISLAND PETTERSON THINKS VESNAR COULD HAVE DELAYED VITAL INFORMATION TO THE FIGHTER SQUADRON AT BARDUFOS
YOU1000000136_S0000383	WE UNDERSTAND THAT RESTNER HAD SYMPATHY FOR ENGLAND
YOU1000000136_S0000384	HOW DID HE LET YOU KNOW THAT THAT HE WAS IN SYMPATHY WITH GERMANY'S ENEMIES
YOU1000000136_S0000385	YOU SPEAK VERY GO
YOU1000000136_S0000387	THAT'S LIKE ACIGARETTE CASE
YOU1000000136_S0000389	OR INSIDE THE
YOU1000000136_S0000391	VESNER WAS IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME BUT WAS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR DELAYING VITAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE RAID
YOU1000000136_S0000392	I THINK VESTNER HAS A FINGER TO STOP SENDING UP GERMANY PLANE TO TAKE THE LANCASTER YES
YOU1000000136_S0000393	YOUYOU MAY BE RIGHT AND THATHAT VESNER AS YOU SAY HAD A HAND IN THE AFFA
YOU1000000136_S0000395	TO HELP SUPPORT SANDER PETERSON'S STORY PATRICK HAS BEEN LOOKING FOR MORE EVIDENCE HE'S UNCOVERED A LETTER IN THE NORWEGIAN ARCHIVES WRITTEN BY VESNAR JUST AFTER THE WAR
YOU1000000136_S0000397	THIS REALLY CONFIRMS THIS MAN'S ANTI NAZI CREDENTIALS NOW ACCORDING TO HIM HE ACTUALLY WAS ACTIVELY WORKING AGAINST HIS OWN PEOPLE AS EARLY AS NINETEEN FORTY FOUR
YOU1000000136_S0000398	IT'S NOT JUST HIM HE'S GOT AT LEAST THREE OTHER COLLEAGUES WHO ARE IN THIS CONSPIRACY IF YOU LIKE WITH HIM THE GERMANS HAD A A SABOTAGE PLAN WHICH THEY WERE GOING TO PUT IN PLACE IF THERE WAS INDEED AN ALLIED LANDING AND THEY'VE GOT QUITE AN ELABORATE PLAN HERE FOR SHOOTING THEIR OWN OFFICERS
YOU1000000136_S0000399	AND RUNNING UP THE WHITE FLAG HE GOES OVER TO THE UNDERGROUND THE NORWEGIAN RESISTANCE AND THEY SMUGGLE HIM OUT NOW IF HE HIS CREDENTIALS WEREN'T PUCKER
YOU1000000136_S0000400	I CAN'T IMAGINE THEY WOULD THEY WOULD DO THAT WILLINGLY SO HE DOES ACTUALLY MATCH UP TO THE DESCRIPTION THAT WERE GIVEN OF HIM BY SANDER
YOU1000000136_S0000402	SO THIS NEW INFORMATION OPENS THE PROSPECT OF AN INTRIGUING NEW THEORY THAT A GOOD GERMAN DID INTERVENE IN A MAJOR OPERATION OF WAR ON THE SIDE OF THE ALLIES AND HAD A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE OUTCOME
YOU1000000136_S0000404	ON HEARING THE NEWS THAT THE BEAST HAD FINALLY BEEN SLAIN CHURCHILL WROTE TO STALIN ARF BOMBERS HAVE SUNK THE TURPITS LET US REJOICE TOGETHER
YOU1000000136_S0000406	FOR THE YOUNG AIRMEN OF NINE AND SIX ONE SEVEN SQUADRONS THERE WAS RELIEF THAT THEY HAD FINALLY FINISHED THE JOB
YOU1000000136_S0000408	WE REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WE'D SUNK IT UNTIL WE GOT BACK TO NEAR BASE AND THEY WIRED US TTHEY SENT OUT A SIGNAL TO SAY IT HAD BEEN DESTROYED
YOU1000000136_S0000409	YEH WE FELT FELT MARVELOUS REALLY YEAH IT WAS CALLED UCHURCHILL'S BEAST WASN'T IT AND I KNOW WE WE SAID TO OURSELVES WELL WE'VE SUNK THE BEAST AT LAST

YOU1000000136_S0000438	I THINK IT WAS VERY WELL PLANNED VERY WELL EXECUTED AND TO THROW THOSE BIG BOMBS IN THIS CLOSE CIRCLE AROUND AND ON THE SHIP
YOU1000000136_S0000439	WAS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT
YOU1000000136_S0000441

YOU1000000137_S0000007	NO ONE HAD THE KNOWLEDGE OF MATHEMATICS PHYSICS AND STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING NEEDED TO PLAN AND ORGANIZE SUCH A VAST PROJECT
YOU1000000137_S0000009	THEN IN THE MID SIXTEENTH CENTURY ARTISTS AND SCHOLARS STEPPED ONTO THE STAGE AND MANAGED TO DO THINGS THAT HAD SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE PREVIOUS THOUSAND YEARS
YOU1000000137_S0000011	WITHIN JUST FOUR GENERATIONS THEY ACRUED THE KNOWLEDGE NECESSARY TO CARRY OUT MASSIVE PROJECTS SUCH AS ST PETER'S
YOU1000000137_S0000013	EUROPE WAS TRANSFORMED UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF INDIVIDUALS LIKE MICHELANGELO BUNARATI MEN OF EXTRAORDINARY ACCOMPLISHMENT AND VERSATILITY WHO FOUND WAYS TO BRING SEEMINGLY IMPOSSIBLE IDEAS TO LIFE

YOU1000000137_S0000043	DURING THE RENAISSANCE WE CAN SEE HOW THIS PESSIMISTIC VIEW HAD BECOME TIRESOME MENTION BI THE IDEA AROSE THAT MAN WAS ALMOST LIKE GOD MAN WAS GOD'S CREATION ENDOWED WITH REASON WITH STRENGTH AND CREATED IN HIS IMAGE
YOU1000000137_S0000044	MAN COULD ALMOST BECOME A GOD

YOU1000000137_S0000479	THE TOWERING FIGURES OF RENAISSANCE ART FIRST AND FOREMOST LIONARDO DAVINCHI AND MICHELANGELO WERE FATED INVITED TO COURT AND PAID HANDSOMELY
YOU1000000137_S0000481	IN THIRTEEN HUNDRED VENETIAN GLASS BLOWERS INVENTED THE CONVEX MIRROR ITS IMPORTANCE IS WIDELY UNDERESTIMATED BUT COMPARED WITH WHAT HAD COME BEFORE ITS REFLECTION WAS BRIGHT AND ALMOST FREE OF DISTORTION
YOU1000000137_S0000483	MOST PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE AGES HAD ONLY SEEN THEIR FACES AS BLURRY REFLECTIONS IN WATER
YOU1000000137_S0000485	THE GLASS MIRROR MEANT PEOPLE COULD REALLY SEE THEMSELVES CLEARLY FOR THE FIRST TIME
YOU1000000137_S0000487	MAYBE THAT'S WHY THEY WERE MORE SELF CONFIDENT THAN THEIR MEDIEVL ANCESTORS
YOU1000000137_S0000489	SELF CONFIDENCE AND PRIDE IN PERSONAL ACHIEVEMENTS WERE NO LONGER SEEN AS SINFUL
YOU1000000137_S0000491	HUMILITY WAS OUT OF STEP WITH THE TIMES
YOU1000000137_S0000493	A PERSON WHO HELD HIS HEAD HIGH AND WALKED TALL IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD WHO SAW REASON AS HIS SPECIAL GIFT FROM GOD AND THOSE WERE THE NEW VALUES

YOU1000000138_S0000059	ONE OF THE FIRST TALES HE TOLD US WHEN WE STARTED TALKING TO HIM WAS ABOUT HOW HE HAD BEEN ARRESTED BUT THIS WASN'T AN ORDINARY ARREST THREE BLACK OARK HELICOPTERS HAD TURNED UP THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN FOR JUST ANYBODY
YOU1000000138_S0000063	THEY MAY LOOK VERY NORMAL BUT THEY ARE INVOLVED IN A VERY VERY DANGEROUS BUSINESS IN MANY WAYS THEY WERE A BIT LIKE THE MEXICAN SUPRANOS IF YOU LIKE

YOU1000000138_S0000089	IT SEEMS INTERESTING THAT WHAT HAPPENS HERE AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS SAY IN ACAPULCO YEAH THEY'RE LINKED BUT NOBODY THINKS ABOUT IT RIGHT
YOU1000000138_S0000090	THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO WE DONT HAVE NO OTHER OPTION
YOU1000000138_S0000092	I REMEMBER ONE FARMER TELLING ME YEAH I KNOW THAT THIS IS POISON BUT IF I DON'T CREATE THIS POISON MY FAMILYIS GOING TO DIE
YOU1000000138_S0000094	SPEAKING TO THEM IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR THAT THEY CONSIDERED THERE WAS A REAL THREAT FROM RIVAL GANGS COMING IN TO TAKE THEIR CROP
YOU1000000138_S0000095	IF WE DON'T HAVE A GUN TO PROTECT US THEY WOULL KILL US
YOU1000000138_S0000097	NOBODY REALLY KNOWS HOW MUCH MONEY IS MADE BY THE DRUG CARTELS BUT IT IS BILLIONS AND BILLIONS AND BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
YOU1000000138_S0000099	IT'S NATIONWIDE IT'S ABSOLUTELY EVERY CITY EVERY TOWN EVERY VILLAGE IN VARYING LEVELS
YOU1000000138_S0000101	OF EITHER INVOLVEMENT IN THE DRUGS OR INVOLVEMENT IN CRIME THAT IS ACTUALLY PERPETUATED BY THIS WHOLE SOCIETY WHERE CRIMINALITY IS COMPLETELY NORMAL
YOU1000000138_S0000103	WE WENT TO MEET A GUY WHO 'S A HIPMAN
YOU1000000138_S0000105	HE EXPLAINED TO US IN IN DETAIL THE HITS THAT HE'S CARRYING OUT
YOU1000000138_S0000107	YOU HAVE BUSINESS RIVALS NOW NOT CARTELS HIRING THIS GUY TO TAKE OUT RIVALS
YOU1000000138_S0000109	IF I NEED TO FIX SOMETHING IN MY BUSINESS AND I THINK THAT MY PARTNER IS STEALING PART OF MY MONEY I JUST CALL THIS GUY
YOU1000000138_S0000111	THE BUSINESS MEN HE'S WORKING FOR AND BUSINESS WOMEN AS HE WAS KEEN TO POINT OUT WILL ACTUALLY ASK FOR REALLY HORRIBLE THINGS HANDS CUT OFF HEADS CUT OFF
YOU1000000138_S0000112	IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT LEVEL OFTE SCALE VIOLENCE
YOU1000000138_S0000114	HE INTERESTINGLY SAW ABSOLUTELY NO REASON TO FEEL ANY TYPE OF REMORSE AND ALTHOUGH HE'S QUITE PLEASANT AND HE'S PLEASANT TO US HE'S A VERY VERY DANGEROUS INDIVIDUAL
YOU1000000138_S0000116	VIOLENCE THROUGHOUT THIS SOCIETY HAS BECOME THE NORM
YOU1000000138_S0000118	IT REALLY IS A MESS AND EVERYBODY WE SPEAK TO DOESN'T SEE AN END TO IT IN FACT THEY SEE IT GETTING WORSE
YOU1000000138_S0000120	THE PROBLEM IS SO BIG AND SO INGRAINED IS IT ACTUALLY
YOU1000000138_S0000122	POSSIBLE TO SORT OUT IT'S BECOME PART OF SOCIETY
YOU1000000138_S0000124	THE CRIME LEVELS AND THE SHEER AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S AVAILABLE FROM CRIME IS GUARANTEENG THAT MEXICO'S GON TO SUFFER FOR A VERY VERY LONG TIME
YOU1000000139_S0000001	I'M YARI CASPAROV AND I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF MY MOST MEMORABLE MOMENTS AT THE CHESSBOARD
YOU1000000139_S0000003	IT'S GAME TWENTY FOUR AGAINST ANTOLE CARPO THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH NINENEIGHTY SEVEN IN SAVIA SPAIN I WAS TRA
YOU1000000139_S0000005	TWELVE TO ELEVEN BEFORE THE LAST GAME AND AS A WORLD CHAMPION I HAD MY LAST CHANCE TO RETAIN THE TITLE BY BEATING CARPOF IN THIS GAME TWENTY FOUR CRUCIAL GAME TWENTY FOUR I WAS NOT RUSHING FROM THE BEGINNING I TRIED TO PLAY A VERY QUIET POSITIONAL GAME
YOU1000000139_S0000006	WAITING FOR CARPO'S MISTAKES AND THE GAME WAS ADJOURNED TO BE RESUMED NEXT DAY
YOU1000000139_S0000008	AND THE POSITION THAT YOU COULD SEE NOW IT'S HARD TO ASSESS I STILL DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S WINNING FOR WHITE OR IT'S DRAW I WOULD SAY IT'S FIFTY FIFTY WHITE HAS AN EXTRA PON AS YOU COULD SEE BUT ALL PONS ARE ON THE SAME SIDE
YOU1000000139_S0000009	THE LIMITED NUMBER OF PIECES SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO ACTUALLY FIND ANY WINNING PLAN FOR WHY
YOU1000000139_S0000011	NEXT DAY WHEN I SHOWED UP AT THE STAGE I WAS COUPLE OF MINUTES EARLIER I HAVE TO SAY THAT WITH MY COACHES WE HAVE BEEN ANALYZING THIS BUT WE COULDN'T FIND ANY DECISIVE IDEAS AND THEN I SAW KARPO ENTERING THE STAGE
YOU1000000139_S0000013	THAT WAS THE CRUCIAL MOMENT BECAUSE I COULD LOOK AT HIS EYES I COULD LOOK AT HIS BODY AND HE LOOKED DOOMED
YOU1000000139_S0000015	I COULD IMMEDIATELY UNDERSTAND THAT HE DIDN'T BELIEVE HE COULD DEFEND HIS POSITION AND THAT'S EVERYTHING IT'S ABOUT YOUR CONFIDENCE THAT YOU CAN EITHER WIN OR DEFEND AND THAT WILL MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE FOR THE OUTCOME OF THE GAME
YOU1000000139_S0000016	SO KARPOV PLAYED G SIX AND I WAS WAITING JUST PLAYING SOME UNIMPORTANT MOVES QUIEN C FIVE QUEN F SEVEN EVEN IF THESE MOVES ARE UNIMPORTANT IT ADDS CHANCES THAT YOU WILL MAKE A MISTAKE AND AFTER AGE FOUR KARPOV MADE A DECISIVE MISTAKE
YOU1000000139_S0000018	JUST AMAZING BECAUSE AFTER THE ADJORNMENT HE HAD TIME TO ANALYZE THIS POSITION HOME AND AND THIS MOVE IT FIXES THE PON STRUCTURE BUT THE PROBLEM IS NOW WHITE CAN EXCHANGE QUIDS AND BECAUSE THESE PONS ARE FIXED THESE TWO WEAKNESSES BLACK POSITION WILL BE LOST
YOU1000000139_S0000019	AND EVENTUALLY I IMPROVED MY POSITION BY THREATENING TO EXCHANGE QUEENS AND PUSHED PUSHED AND PUSHED AND EVENTUALLY WON THE GAME
YOU1000000139_S0000021	SO THAT'S ONE OF THE CLEAREST MOMENTS WHERE YOU COULD SEE THE TRANSLATION OF YOUR PSYCHOLOGICAL WEAKNESS INTO SERIOUS MISTAKES AT THE CHESSBOARD
YOU1000000139_S0000023	IT IS ANOTHER MEMORABLE MOMENT VERY PAINFUL ONE I HAVE TO ADMIT NINETEN NINETY SIX THE FINAL MATCH FOR AGRUND PRE EVENT RAPID BLITZ CHESS THAT I PLAYED AGAINST VISHI ANNAN
YOU1000000139_S0000025	I THINK I HAVE TO EMPHASIZE IT'S A BLIT GAME SO IT'S A FIVE MINUTE CHESS IT'S NOT ABOUT MAKING LONG TERM CALCULATIONS THITS MOVES PLAYED BY INSTINCT
YOU1000000139_S0000027	WE PLAYED TWO BLIT GAMES THE FIRST ONE I WAS ALMOST LOSING BUT MANAGED TO ESCAPE AND THAT'S THE LAST DECISIVE GAME I PLAYED WAS BLACK TOTALLY OUTPLAYED HEM AS YOU COULD LOOK AT THE POSITION BLACK HAS TWO PONTS LET ME EMPHASIZE TWO EXTRA POINTS
YOU1000000139_S0000029	AND TOTAL DOMINATION IN THE CENTER SO I DON'T KNOW WHICH MOVE IS NOT WINNING YOU KNOW IF YOU DON'T MAKE A MOVE YOU'RE STILL WINNING BUT I WANTED JUST TO EXCHANGE QUEENS AND OF COURSE YOU CAN TAKE WITH A NIGHT HERE AND THEN AFTER EXCHANGE OF QUEENS IT'S AN END GAME WITH TWO EXTRA POINTS
YOU1000000139_S0000030	I THINK THAT MOST LIKELY ANNAN WOULD HAVE RESIGNED IF I JUST TAKE WIS A NIGHTE RON I THREE BUT SUDDENLY I THOUGHT YOU KNOW WHY TOOK WAS A NIGHT IF I DODN'T CA O THE SAME BY EXCHANGING CQUOINS BY TAKING WS QUEEN
YOU1000000139_S0000031	THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHITE DOES NOT HAVE TO I'S NOT FORCED TO TAKE THE QUEEN ALL OF A SUDDEN I HAS A MOVE QUEEN TAKES G FOUR AND INSTEAD OF HAVING WINNING POSITION BLACK NOW IS LOST BECAUSE MY QUEEN IS ATTACKED
YOU1000000139_S0000032	MY ROOK IS ATTACKED MY BISHOP IS ATTACKED AND THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT
YOU1000000139_S0000034	O THAT'S ONE OF THE WORST BLUNDERS I MEA I COULDN'T SEE MY FACE I COULD IMAGINE THIS ONE THE HUNDREDS OF HUNDREDS OF IMAGES SHOWING MY CALL IT FRUSTRATION
YOU1000000139_S0000036	AND IT'S IT COST ME THE VICTORY IN THE FINAL BUT ALSO IT'S KIND OF A MEMORY SCARV SO IT'S JUST IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS JUST IT'S IT'S SITTING THERE SO
YOU1000000139_S0000037	EVEN BO TWENTY YEARS LATER I CANNOT LOOK AT THIS POSITION WITHOUT SOME SORT OF PAIN
YOU1000000139_S0000039	ANOTHER VERY MEMORABLE AND VERY PAINFUL MOMENT
YOU1000000139_S0000041	IT'S LAST GAME OF MY FAMOUS REMATCH AGAINST DE BLU IN NINETEN NINTY SEVEN BECAUSE I WON THE FIRST ONE ININETEN NINETY SIX THE MATCH WAS A TIE EACH SIDE WONE ONE GAME WITH THREE DRAWS PLAYED WITH BLACK PIECES
YOU1000000139_S0000042	AND I MISSED MY CHANCES GAME FOUR ON FIVE AND I I WASN'T SURE WHEN I STARTED THE GAME AND I PICKED UP THE LINE THAT I NEVER PLAYED BEFORE
YOU1000000139_S0000043	BUT THAT WAS MY HOPE THAT SINCE I NEVER PLAYED IT BEFORE AND IT WAS NOT PART OF MY OPENING REPERTOIRE THAT COMPUTER WOULD NOT BE READY
YOU1000000139_S0000045	AND I PLAY IN THIS POSITION VERY RISKY TO BE PRECISE BAD MOVE HE SIX ATTACKING THE KNIFE AND PROVOKING WITE TO SACRIFICE A PIECE WHICH IS VERY STRONG IT'S MAYBE NOT WINNING BUT GIVES WHITE A VERY STRONG INITIATIVE
YOU1000000139_S0000046	UTMACHINES DON'T SACRIFICE HE PIECE FOR A PON WITHOUT HAVING A CONCRETE OUTCOME INSIDE
YOU1000000139_S0000048	SO I EXPECTED THAT COMPUTER WOULD GO BACK ON FOUR BECAUSE THIS MOOVE WAS NOT IN THE SPECIAL DATABASE PREPARED BY GRANDMASTER TEAM THAT WORKED WITH DE BLUE
YOU1000000139_S0000049	AND TO MY HORROR DEBLU IMMEDIATELY TOOK ON SIX WHICH MEANT THAT THE MOOFE WAS ALREADY PUT IN
YOU1000000139_S0000051	I JUST COULDN'T PLAY THIS GAME POSITION WAS PRETTY DANGEROUS AND BAD BUT YOU KNOW I LOST IT IN FEW MOVES BECAUSE I WAS SHOCKED BY THE FACT THAT I JUST MADE SUCH MISCALCULATIONS
YOU1000000139_S0000053	I FOUND OUT LATER ACTUALLY MANY YEARS LATER THAT I WAS RIGHT ON BOTH COUNTS ONE IS THAT MACHINES DIDN'T PLAY SUCH MOVES IT WAS JUST AGAINST MACHINES LOGIC AND THAT WAS ADMITTED BY THE DEEP BLUE TEAM
YOU1000000139_S0000054	SAYING DEEPBLU WOULD HAVE NEVER MADE THIS MOVE UNLESS THAT VERY MORNING THEY DECIDED TO INSTALL THIS OPENING POSITION IN THE OPENING BOOK MAYBE IT'S THE MOST FAMOUS GAME IN THE HISTORY OF CHESS IF YOU LOOK AT THE SHEER NUMBERS FORPEOPLE WHO FOLLOWED IT
YOU1000000139_S0000055	MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE IT WAS A WATERSHED MOMENT WHERE MACHINES ESTABLISHED ITS DOMINANCE OVER HUMAN PLAYERS NOW OF COURSE THE FREE CHESS APP ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE TODAY IS STRONGER THAN THE BLUE
YOU1000000139_S0000057	THIS IS ARGUABLY MOST IMPORTANT GAME IN MY LIFE GAME TWENTY FOUR AGAINST ANTONY CARPO IN OUR SECOND MATCH N NINE EIGHTY FIVE
YOU1000000139_S0000059	I WAS LEADING TWELVE TO ELEVEN BEFORE THE LAST GAME AND CARPOV HAD TO WIN TO RETAIN HIS TITLE
YOU1000000139_S0000061	AND AS YOU COAUND SEE HE ACHIEVED VERY PROMISING POSITION IT'S A WHITE CONCENTRATION ON THE KINGS SIDE IT'S MENACING AND WHITE HAS QUITE A FEW OPTIONS ONE IS JUST IT'S I SHOULD ALWAYS WATCH F FIVE AS THE ASA BREAKTHROUGH
YOU1000000139_S0000062	ANOTHER ONE IS A LITTLE MORE SUBTLE TO PLAY BISHOP D FOUR JUST EXCHANGING THE BISHOP THAT IS ONE OF THE KEY DEFENDERS FOF BLACK SKING AND IF BLAK GOS FIVE THEN HE TAKES NOW BECAUSE OF THE ATTACK ON F SEVEN I HAVE TO TAKE WATS A KNIGHT
YOU1000000139_S0000064	BUT THEN QUIEN ACTUALLY CHANGES ITS DIRECTION ATTACKING AHE SEVEN POINT
YOU1000000139_S0000066	SO THERE ARE MANY OPTIONS FOR WHITE AND IT SEEMS THAT LACK HAD NOTHING TO DO TO IMPROVE ITS POSITION
YOU1000000139_S0000068	HERE AFTER LONG THOUGHT I FOUND ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT MOVES IN MY LIFE AND AT FIRST SIGHT IT'S A PARADOX BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT YOUR ROOK IN SUCH UGLY POSITION AS E SEVEN
YOU1000000139_S0000069	BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO DO INSTEAD OF WHITE YOU KNOW PUSHING ON THE KING'S SIDE THE GAME SHIFTED TO THE CENTER AND THE QUEEN'S SIDE AND PRIORITY HERE IS TO DEFEND THE KING ROOK HERE PROTECTS THISPON AND NEUTRALIZES BOTH OF WHITE THREADS
YOU1000000139_S0000070	AND THAT'S MOST IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF WHITE INITIATIVE DOESN'T PRODUCE IMMEDIATE RESULTS THEN EVENTUALLY BLACK CAN DO SOMETHING ACT
YOU1000000139_S0000072	AND I REMEMBER THAT WHEN I PLAYED ROUPE SEVEN AND CARPORK CAME BACK TO THE CHESSBOARD FROM HIS GREEN ROOM INSTANTLY YOU COULD FEEL THAT HE SENSED THAT SOMETHING HAS CHANGED HE DIDN'T LIKE IT SO I ACTUALLY GAINED EVEN MORE CONFIDENCE
YOU1000000139_S0000074	YOUR CONFIDENCE IS NOT ONLY GOOD FOR YOU BUT SOMEHOW IT TRANSCENDS TO YOUR OPPONENT AND IT IT UNDERMINES YOUR OPPONENT'S CONFIDENCE
YOU1000000139_S0000076	AND THE CARPOV MADE A QUIERT MOVE KING DI AN I PUT ANOTHER ROOK HERE WHICH IS TOTALLY ODD BECAUSE BOTH ROOKS ARE JUST STANDING BEHIND THE PON ONLY SIX BUT I'M JUST FIGHTING AGAINST F FIVE AND THEN CATORU DI AN I EVEN PLAY F FIVE
YOU1000000139_S0000077	AND CARPO TOOK AMPASAN I TOOK ONE OF SIX AND THEN EVENTUALL I SACRIFICED TE PON
YOU1000000139_S0000079	GAME ENDED UP WITH AN COMPLICATED POSITION THAT SKARPOV HAD TO FORCE A DRAW BUT HE DECIDED TO PRESS FORWARD BECAUSE DRAW DIDN'T MAKE ANY GOOD TO HIM AND EVENTUALLY I WON THE GAME WON THE MATCH AND WON MY TITLE NOVEMBER NINE NINE EGHTY FIVE

YOU1000000147_S0000014	CAVEAR IS USUALLY MADE FROM THE EGGS OF THE SAVRUGA ESETRA AND BALUGA SPECIES OF STURGEON FISH
YOU1000000147_S0000015	BUT THIS WIDE CAVEAR COMES EXCLUSIVELY FROM THE ALBINO BALUGA STURGEON WHICH LIVES IN THE CASPIAN SEA
YOU1000000147_S0000016	BECAUSE THEIR ALBANISM IS CAUSED BY A GENETIC DISORDER ALBINOBALUGAS ARE EXTREMELY RARE NOWADAYS
YOU1000000147_S0000017	THAT DOESN'T STOP THE FILTHY RICH FROM DASHING THEIR CHANCES OF SURVIVAL EVEN MORE BY EATING THEIR EGGS ANYWAY

YOU1000000147_S0000022	THESE AREN'T ANY OLD BIRDS NESTS BUT THE NESTS OF SWALLOWS OR SWIFTLITS WHICH ARE MADE FROM A HUNDRED PERCENT SALIVA
YOU1000000147_S0000023	THAT'S RIGHT THESE BIRDS MAKE THEIR BABIE'S HOMES OUT OF THEIR OWN SOLIDIFIED SPIT AND SOME CULINARY CONOSSEURS CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THE STUFF
YOU1000000147_S0000024	WHEN THEY'RE BOILED IN WATER THE DELICATE NEST DISSOLVE INTO A GELATINOUS GOOP WHICH IS SUPPOSEDLY PERFECT FOR SOUPS YME
YOU1000000147_S0000025	THE ASKING PRICE OF ABOUT A HUNDRED DOLLARS PER BOWL CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO HOW HARD THE NETS ARE TO GET A HOLD OF IN THE FIRST PLACE
YOU1000000147_S0000026	CLIMBERS MUST SCALE THE DARK AND DIZZYING HEIGHTS OF THE MADIA CAVES IN MALAYSIA TO SCOUT FOR NESTS THAT ARE READY FOR THE PICKING

YOU1000000147_S0000030	THIS LAMBRGINI POULTRY GROWS AT A SLOWER RATE AND SUPPOSEDLY TASTES SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN YOUR EVERYDAY KIND BUT SAMANIS AREN'T ACTUALLY EATIN FOR THEIR FLAVOR
YOU1000000147_S0000031	THE REASON FOR ITS ELUSIVENESS AND DESIRABILITY IS THAT THE BIRD CAN BE TRACED BACK TO JAPANESE FOLKLORE OF THE TWELFTH CENTURY
YOU1000000147_S0000032	WHERE IT WAS CONSIDERED A MYSTICAL FOOD OF THE ELITE ITS CHARCOAL COLORED BLOOD IS ALSO RUMORED TO BRING POWER AND WEALTH UPON THOSE WHO CONSUME IT MAKING IT A SOUGHT AFTER GOOD LUCK CHARM IN CERTAIN CULTURES
YOU1000000147_S0000033	SAMANIS ARE HARD TO COME BY IN THE U S SO THE ASKING PRICE CAN BE UP TO TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A FULL GROWN BIRD AND TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR A SINGLE NEWBORN CHICK

YOU1000000147_S0000038	COBI BEEF IS RENOWNED FOR ITS SUPERIOR FLAVOUR TENDERNESS AND HIGH AMOUNT OF INTERMUSCULAR FAT WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO ITS MELT IN THE MOUTH QUALITIES
YOU1000000147_S0000039	ALL WAGU BEEF IS RATED ON A MARVELING SCALE OF ONE TO TWELVE BASED ON THIS DISTRIBUTION OF FAT AND COBY BEEF ONLY QUALIFIES IF IT SCORES BETWEEN TEN TO TWELVE
YOU1000000147_S0000040	THE LUXURY BEEF MARKET HAS EVEN BEEN TAINTED BY CONTROVERSY AFTER NUMEROUS ESTABLISHMENTS TRIED TO PASS OFF REGULAR WAGU BEEF AS COBY
YOU1000000147_S0000041	WITH COBE FRAUD RAMPANT IN THE U S ALL CUTS MUST NOW BE ASSIGNED A TEN DIGIT ID NUMBER SO THAT IT CAN BE TRACED BACK TO THE COW IT CAME FROM
YOU1000000147_S0000042	RESTURANTURS MUST ALSO CARRY A LICENSE OF AUTHENTICITY THAT CAN BE SHOWN ON DEMAND
YOU1000000147_S0000043	SO IF YOU'RE A BEEF OFFICIANATO IT'S WORTH CHECKING BEFORE SHELLING OUT UP TO THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR A SINGLE POUND OF MEAT

YOU1000000147_S0000049	THE MEAT COMES FROM PRIZED FREERANGE BLONDE AQUATAINE CATTLE AND IS PRODUCED BY PARISIAN BUTCHER ALEXANDRE POLMARD ON HIS FAMILY FARM IN NORTHEASTERN FRANCE
YOU1000000147_S0000050	THE EXTORTIONATE PRICE TAG IS THANKS TO THE TECHNIQUE POMARD DEVELOPED IN THE NINETEEN NINETY S TO TREAT THE MEAT
YOU1000000147_S0000051	THE CATTLE ARE HAND REARED AND FREE TO ROAM THE FORESTS AND GRASSLANDS OF THE FRINGE COUNTRYSIDE AND ONLY FOUR ARE KILLED WEEKLY
YOU1000000147_S0000052	EACH COW IS THEN SLAUGHTERED HUMANELY TO MAKE THE PROCESS AS STRESS FREE AS POSSIBLE AND TO KEEP ACIDITY LEVELS AT A MINIMUM
YOU1000000147_S0000053	THE MEAT IS THEN STORED IN A ROOM AND PUMPED WITH A CONSTANT STREAM OF AIR AT SPEEDS OF ALMOST SEVENTY FIVE MILES PER HOUR

YOU1000000147_S0000059	WHY YOU ASK FIRSTLY THEY'RE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY GROWN ON THE TINY ISLAND OF NOA MUTE OFF THE COAST OF WESTERN FRANCE AND ONLY ABOUT TWENTY TONS ARE PRODUCED YEARLY
YOU1000000147_S0000060	PREPARING THEM FOR SALE IS ALSO AN ARDUOUS PROCESS BECAUSE THEY'RE TOO DELICATE TO BE MACHINE HARVESTED
YOU1000000147_S0000061	SO EACH POTATO MUST BE CAREFULLY HANDPICKED INSTEAD WITH ALL THE ADDED EFFORT IT TAKES TO GET A HOLD OF HEM YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING WHY LABANAT POTATOES ARE WORTH EATING TO BEGIN WITH
YOU1000000147_S0000062	FANS OF THE SOUPED UP SPUD SAY THE SEA AIR AND SEA WATER WHICH ACTS AS A FERTILIZER FOR THE SOIL GIVES THE POTATOES A HINT OF SEA SALT AND EVEN A SUGGESTION OF LEMON

YOU1000000147_S0000067	WHITE TRUFFLES OR THE DIAMOND OF THE KITCHEN ARE BY FAR THE BEST THE NOBLY WHITE MUSHROOMS CAN ONLY BE HARVESTED BETWEEN OCTOBER THROUGH DECEMBER
YOU1000000147_S0000068	AND THE FOREST OF PEDMON AND NORTHERN ITALY WHERE THEY GROW INCHES BELOW THE EARTH WITH THE ROOTS OF HARDWOOD TREES WHICH MEANS FINDING THEM ISN'T EASY

YOU1000000151_S0000001	THE FRS AND ITS SISTERS HAVE GOTTEN A LOT OF ATTENTION AS THE AFFORDABLE ENTHUSIAST REARE WHEEL DRIVE CAR THE DEFACTO STANDARD HOWEVER THE BRITISH PIONEERED THIS IDEA AND THE JAPANESE REFINED IT SO WE BROUGHT ALONG
YOU1000000151_S0000003	TWO THOUSAND AND A MAZDA R XEIGHT TO FIND OUT IF THE FRS TRULY IS THE BEST EXAMPLE
YOU1000000151_S0000004	AND THESE ARE THE TWO THAT YOU'VE ASKED FOR I MEAN WE'VE HAD SO MANY REQUESTS
YOU1000000151_S0000006	I'M EXCITED TO DO IT BUT IAM A LITTLE CONCERNED I MAY HAVE DUG MYSELF A WHOLE
YOU1000000151_S0000007	WELL SO WHAT'S WRONG
YOU1000000151_S0000008	WELL ON THE PCH PIECE I MAY HAVE SAID I MAY HAVE SAID THAT THE FRS WAS BETTER
YOU1000000151_S0000010	I THINK YOU DID SAY THAT
YOU1000000151_S0000011	I THINK I I TINK EMEMBER THAT SO NOW I AM PREPARED TO BE WRONG WE HAVE THEM HERE I'M PREPARED TO DRIVE THEM I'M PREPARED TO BE WRONG
YOU1000000151_S0000012	I THINK I'M GOINGTA BE WRONG TOO I THINK
YOU1000000151_S0000013	ACTUALLY YOU KNOW WHAT NO MATTER HOW THIS GOES THE FAN BOYS FOR THESE CARS ARE SO SERIOUS
YOU1000000151_S0000014	WEL THAT'S TRUE THI'S GONGTO BE WNTHIS IS THE WRONG REVIEW THESE AR THE WRONG
YOU1000000151_S0000016	THAT WHATEVER WE SAY
YOU1000000151_S0000018	THIS IS ABOUT THE TONLY TIME YOU'RE GOIN TO SEE ALL THREE OF THESE CARS UNBIASED BY NON OWNERS TOGETHER THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE YOU'VE ASKED FOR IT SO LET'S GO BE WRONG
YOU1000000151_S0000020	SO HERE IS THE SAME WHITE FRS WE HAD ON OUR PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY SHOOT
YOU1000000151_S0000022	IT'S ONE OF THE FIRST EIGHTY SIX FR S THAT WE'RE IN THE COUNTRY AND I JUST LIKE THIS CAR
YOU1000000151_S0000023	IT'S ALWAYS NICE TO GET BACK IN A CAR THAT YOU REMEMBERED LOVING AND IT DIDN'T LET YOU DOWN
YOU1000000151_S0000025	THE FRS IS NOT DISAPPOINTING ME PERSONALLY I FEEL LIKE THE BR C IS THE BETTER SET UP HOWEVER AND I'M GETTING BACK TO THE FRS THINKING I LOVED IT BUT WE WERE COMPARING IT AGAINST DIFFERENT CARS
YOU1000000151_S0000026	THE TWO CARS WE BROUGHT ALONG WITH IT PRETTY STEEP COMPETITION
YOU1000000151_S0000028	LAST TIME WE DROVE THE R X EIGHT FOR THE SHOW IT WAS AN O FOUR THIS IS A TWENTY ELEVEN IN FACT IT'S THE LAST R X EIGHT R THREE SOLD IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND I MAINTAIN THAT EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS CAR IS JUST ODD
YOU1000000151_S0000029	TKIND OF OFF KILTER UNIQUE THI SECOND GENERATION R X AIGHT IS DEFINITELY MORE REFINED THAN THE FIRST GENERATION
YOU1000000151_S0000030	AFTER HAVING DRIVEN THE FIRST GENERATION R X EIGHT I FEEL LIKE THAT CAR WAS MORE WILLING JUST SLIGHTLY MORE WILLING THAN THIS CAR BUT WHAT I DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY'VE DONE IS COMPLETELY TAKE AWAY THAT FUN TO DRIVE THAT JUST
YOU1000000151_S0000031	BRILLIANT ENTHUSIASM SO THIS CAR REPRESENTS THE MOST SORDED BEST EXAMPLE OF RX AT
YOU1000000151_S0000033	OF COURSE THERE'S TWO VERSIONS OF THE HANDAS TWO THOUSAND AND THEY ARE MUCH DEBATED THE AP ONE AND THE AP TWO THIS IS AN A P TWO IF YOU WANT TO GO WITH THE A P ONE VERSION WITH A HIGHER RED LINE AND A LITTLE BIT MORE TAIL HAPPY SUSPENSION
YOU1000000151_S0000034	THEN YOU CAN GET THM CHEAPER BUT IN THIS AP TWO THEY DEFINITELY REFINED THE CAR AND OF COURSE YOU'RE BUYING ONE OF THE MOST RELIABLE CARS EVER MADE THE GUY THAT OWNS THIS HAS GOT ALMOST EIGHTY THOUSAND MILES ON IT HAS NEVER DONE ANYTHING MORE THAN STANDARD MAINTENANCE
YOU1000000151_S0000035	WHAT'S GREAT IS YOU'VE GOT THAT NEARLY BULLETPROOF NATURE OF HANDA CAR SO YOU DON'T HAVE O WORRY ABOUT BEATING ON THIS THING NOW THE CAR WE'RE DRIVING TODAY IS THE CAR WE DROVE IN OUR STANDALONE HANDA S TWO THOUSAND REVIEW SO DRIVING IT LATER
YOU1000000151_S0000036	IT'S GOT OF COURSE MORE MILES AND IT STILL FEELS FRESH I'M SAD TO SAY THESE CARS ARE NO LONGER IN THE MARKET AND IT'S ALSO A TRAGEDY THAT HANDA IS BUILDING THINGS LIKE THE HANDA PANAMER I MEAN THE HANDA CROSSTOHER
YOU1000000151_S0000038	GETTING RIGHT OUT OF THE OTHER CARS INTO THE FRS IS TRULY REVEALING I WASN'T THINKING THAT THE FRS NEEDED MORE POWER I THOUGHT IT WAS FINE
YOU1000000151_S0000040	I'M WRONG ABOUT THAT IN SPITE IFT BEING THE LEAST POWERFUL THE FRS IS ACTUALLY THE EASIEST TO LAUNCH BUT IT ALSO RUNS OUT OF BREATH THE FASTEST I MEAN ABOVE ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND RPMS IF YOU PUT YOUR FOOT TO THE FLOOR
YOU1000000151_S0000041	YOU EXPECT THAT EXTRA LITTLE SURGE WHEN YOU MAT THE GAS AND IT JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN HERE I AM STEPPING ON THE THROTTLE AND I FEEL LIKE THE FRS IS HOLDING SOMETHING BAK
YOU1000000151_S0000043	AND THAT FEELING ISN'T THAT IT'S HOLDING SOMETHING BACK IT JUST DOESN'T HAVE ANY MORE TO GIVE
YOU1000000151_S0000045	NOW THIS S TWO THOUSAND HAS THE FORTY MORE HORSE POWER THAT WE WISH WE HAD IN THE FRS
YOU1000000151_S0000047	BUT IT HAS ALMOST THE EXACT SAME TOR
YOU1000000151_S0000049	SO BECAUSE OF FCOURSE THE MUCH LOVED HANDA VTECH ENGINE YOU GOT TO REV IT PRETTY HIGH TO FIND THE POWER IN THIS CAR
YOU1000000151_S0000050	THERE'S ENOUGH THERE I'M NOT WANTING FOR POWER AND AS HARD AS YOU CAN REB THE ENGINE IT'S JUST A CONSTANT SURGE
YOU1000000151_S0000052	AND YOU FEEL THAT VTECH CHANGE OVER RIHT ABOUT SIX THOUSAND RPMS AND IT GIVE YOU THAT EXTRA LITTLE KICK IN THE ASS WHEN THE FRS IS JUST DYING AWAY THE S TWO THOUSAND IS A SECOND FASTER ZERO TO SIXTY THAN THE FRS
YOU1000000151_S0000053	I MEAN THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE ONLY STAT YOU NEED TO KNOW TO REMIND YOU THAT THE FRS IS JUST UNDERPOWERED
YOU1000000151_S0000055	THE R X EIGHT ALSO HAS THE MISSING INGREDIENT THE FR S DOES NOT MORE POWER
YOU1000000151_S0000056	AND THIS ENGINE IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT IT'S ATYPICAL IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT ITS REPUTATION IS NOT ALL THAT RELIABLE IT'S SO SILKY SMOOTH IT FEELS LIKE SOMEHOW THIS ENGINE IS BETTER LUBRICATED AND BETTER BUILT THAN ANYTHING YOU'VE EVER DRIVEN
YOU1000000151_S0000057	THERE'S NO VIBRATION IT JUST SINGS UP THROUGH THE RPM HEADED TOWARD ITS NINE THOUSAND R PM REDLINE HOWEVER EVEN THOUGH THE R X EIGHT IS MORE POWERFUL THAN THE FRS DOESN'T ACTUALLY FEEL LIKE IT
YOU1000000151_S0000058	IT'S NOT REALLY ANY FASTER AND LIKE THE FRS IT NEVER GIVES ME AS MUCH AS I EXPECT
YOU1000000151_S0000060	THE RX AT MAKES GREAT POWER YOU'RE JUST GOING TA NOT THINK THAT IT DOES ANYWHERE BELOW FIVE THOUSAND RPM
YOU1000000151_S0000062	YOU'VE GOT TO GRAB THIS CARD BY THE SCRUFF OF THE NECK SMACK IT AROUND AND MAKE IT YOUR BITCH OTHERWISE YOU'RE NOT GONG TA BE SMILING ONCE YOU DO YOU WILL BE HAPPY
YOU1000000151_S0000064	NOW I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FOR EVERY PERSON YOU HEAR ABOUT WHO'S GONE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND MILES ON THEIR FIRST ROTERY ENGINE THERE'S THE GUY NEXT TO HIM WITH AN RX AIGH THAT'S DONE THREE ENGINES IN AHUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND MILES THE BIG TRICK IS THESE ENGINES BURN A LOT OF GAS
YOU1000000151_S0000065	AND THEY BURN A LOT OF OIL JUST DURING THE HARDDRIVING OF THIS SHOOT WE'VE BURNED ALMOST A HALF QUART OF OIL
YOU1000000151_S0000067	NW WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT ALL THREE OF THESE CARS IS THEY'VE GOT ELECTRIC POWER STEERING
YOU1000000151_S0000068	FOR ALL THE COMPLAINTS THAT ARE HAPPENING RIGHT NOW FOR POOR ELECTRIC STEERING RACKS IN CARS EACH OF THESE THREE CARS HAVE ELECTRIC POWER STEERING AND ALL OF THEM GET IT RIGHT
YOU1000000151_S0000069	SO IF YOU'VE ASSOCIATED ELECTRIC POWER STEERING WITH SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT WHEN YOU'RE DRIVING OR FEEL GOOD OR HAVE GOOD STEERING FEEDBACK YOU'RE COMPLETELY WRONG
YOU1000000151_S0000071	OWTHE STEERING ON THE R X EIGHT DOESN'T FEEL QUITE AS SHARP BUT WHAT'S NICE IS THE HARDER YOU PUSH THIS CAR THE BETTER IT GETS
YOU1000000151_S0000072	IYOU COMPARE THE RX EIGHT STEERING TO MOST CARS IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO WIN IT IS A VERY INFORMATIVE STEERING RACK BUT IT FEELS LARGER AND MORE DISCONNECTED THAN THE OTHER TWO CARS
YOU1000000151_S0000074	IF YOU THINK THE HANDLING ON THE RX EIGHT IS NUMB YOU OUGHT TO HAVE YOUR HEAD EXAMINED I WOULD SAY THE STEERING FEELS SLIGHTLY MUTED BUT IT DOESN'T FEEL NUMB
YOU1000000151_S0000076	THIS IS SO STRANGE I CAN FEEL THE LONGER WHEEL BASE BUT IT PLANTS ITSELF SO WELL
YOU1000000151_S0000078	NOW THIS R THREE MAKES IT FAR MORE AGGRESSIVE IT'S GOT A STIFFER SUSPENSION AND IN FACT THIS CAR HAS THE LONGEST WHEEL BASE BUT THE WORST RIDE ON THE HIGHWAY IT JUST KIND OF VIBRATES AND POPS AS YOU GO ALONG AT NORMAL HIGHWAY SPEEDS
YOU1000000151_S0000080	EVEN IN THIS COMPANY THE FRS IS AN INCREDIBLY EASY CAR TO DRIVE VERY FAST NOW OF COURSE IT CAN'T GET UP TO SPEED AS FAST BUT ONCE YOU'RE THERE THIS CAN HANG ON TO SPEED IN CORNERS ALMOST BETTER THAN THE OTHER TWO
YOU1000000151_S0000081	WITH A BETTER SET OF TIRES I THINK YOU CAN OUTGRIP THEM BOTH BUT THE GREAT THING IS THIS JUST TELLS YOU SO MUCH ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON THAT IT GIVES YOU A LOT OF CONFIDENCE PARTIALLY BECAUSE THE LIMITS IN THE FRS ARE LOW ENOUGH THAT YOU CAN APPROACH THEM SAFELY AND YOU CAN FEEL THEM COMING
YOU1000000151_S0000083	SOME WAYS THE FRS IS LIKE HAVING A REALLY GOOD NAVIGATOR THEY'RE TELLING YOU INFORMATION ALL THE TIME AND THE FASTER YOU DRIVE THE MORE THEIR INFORMATION JUST INCREASES
YOU1000000151_S0000084	I REALLY DO LOVE THE PLICKABILITY OF THIS CAR IT REALLY DOES SEEM LIKE IT'S ON AN EDGE
YOU1000000151_S0000086	ANTHE CHASSI DYNAMICS ARE GOOD BECAUSE OF THAT LOW CENTER OF GRAVITY BECAUSE OF WHERE THAT ENGINE IS AT BUT TO TURN THE FRS FROM REALLY REALLY GOOD INTO GREAT IT NEEDS MORE POWER
YOU1000000151_S0000087	I WAS WRONG
YOU1000000151_S0000089	IT'S GOOD
YOU1000000151_S0000091	BUT IT ISN'T THE HANDA S TWO THOUSAND
YOU1000000151_S0000093	THERE'S ZERO BODY ROLL IN THIS CAR I MEAN SHORT OF LIKE THE CORVET C R ONE WE DROVE THIS HAS GOT THE LEAST BODY ROLL I'VE EVER FELT OF COURSE THE S TWO THOUSAND BRAGS A FIFTY FIFTY WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION AND IT WEIGHS WHITH THE F RS WAIGHS
YOU1000000151_S0000095	THIS CARIS HANDLING IS UNBELIEVABLY SHARP AND WHAT I LOVE IS YOU CAN JUST ROLL ONTO THE THROTTLE AND PUSH IT HARDER AND HARDER
YOU1000000151_S0000097	THROUGH THE CORNER JUST LIKE YOU DO A MOTORCYCLE THE HARDER YOU ROLL ONTO THE THROTTLE THE MORE IT SETTLES THE CAR
YOU1000000151_S0000098	THE FRS HAS A LITTLE BIT BETTER INITIAL TURN IN BECAUSE THE STEERING RACK IS TIGHTER BUT THE S TWO THOUSAND SEEMS TO LINK THE CORNER MORE CONSISTENTLY THAN THE FRS IT GETS A LITTLE BIT F SLIDE A LITTLE BIT OF SCRUB GOING ON AND THE S TWO THOUSAND JUST CLINGS AND HANGS ON
YOU1000000151_S0000100	GETTING BACK IN THE FRS IS LIKE LOOKING UP YOUR HIGH SCHOOL SWEETHEART ON FACEBOOK AND
YOU1000000151_S0000102	FINDING OUT THAT SHE'S
YOU1000000151_S0000104	ALMOST AS GOOD AS YOU REMEMBER HER BUT HERE'S THE THING ABOUT THE FRS THIS IS VERSION ONE POINT
YOU1000000151_S0000106	DESIGNED THIS CAR AND MADE IT SPECIFICALLY WITH THE THINKING IN MIND
YOU1000000151_S0000107	PEOPLE WOULD BE ADDING TO IT HOWEVER I WANT THIS CAR TO BE JUST THAT MUCH BETTER IT'S SO GOOD WHY CANT IT BE RIGHT
YOU1000000151_S0000108	I REALLY DO LOVE THIS CAR I STEP AWAY FOR A WHILE AND I THINK IT REALLY PROBABLY WASN'T THAT GOOD AND I COME BACK AND I REALIZE YOU KNOW WHAT THE FRS IS OVERHYPED BUT THE ACCALADES IT'S GOTTEN ARE COMPLETELY DESERVED
YOU1000000151_S0000109	THIS IS A REALLY IMPRESSIVE CAR IT IS A REWARDING AND FUN TO DRIVE CAR AND HOW RARELY IS THAT AVAILABLE AT TWENTY FIVE BRAND NEW
YOU1000000151_S0000111	THIS HAS ALL THE REFINEMENT AND THE FINE TUNING THAT THE FRS JUST HASN'T GOTTEN YET I EXPECT THAT IT WILL BUT THIS R X EIGHT IS ABOUT AS GREAT AS THIS CAR IS GOING TO GET AND IT FEELS VERY REFINED
YOU1000000151_S0000112	I REMEMBER LIKING THE FIRST GENERATION R X EIGHT IT WAS VERY WILLING AND I LOVE THIS CAR EVEN MORE
YOU1000000151_S0000113	THE THING ABOUT THE RXEIGHT FOR ME IS THAT I'M VERY IMPRESSED I RESPECT IT I JUST CAN'T FALL IN LOVE WITH IT
YOU1000000151_S0000115	IT'S LIKE MEETING A FRIEND OF YOURS GIRLFRIEND AND YOU RECOGNIZE THAT SHE'S HOT BUT FOR WHATEVER REASON SHEUS DOESN'T DO ANYTHING FOR YOU
YOU1000000151_S0000117	I'VE GOT TO LISTEN TO MY HEART I'VE GOTTA LISTEN TO THE CAR THAT MADE ME GRIN AS SOON AS I GOT IN IT AGAIN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THE MOST PURE THE CLEAREST DRIVING EXPERIENCE
YOU1000000151_S0000118	FOR ENTHUSIASTS IT'S THE HANDA S TWO THOUSAND
YOU1000000151_S0000119	THE DOWNSIDES TO THE S TWO THOUSAND KIND OF PUT ME IN A DILEMMA IT'S CRAMPED IN HERE IT'S LOUD YOU'VE GOT TO SEND THE ENGINE RUBING WITH THE STRATASPHERE TO GET ME POWER OUT OF IT THESE ARE ALL THE SAME ISSUES I HAVE WITH THE LOTUS ALEASE
YOU1000000151_S0000120	AND AT TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY GRAND I'M JUST GONGNA BUY THE LOTUS BUT AT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY GRAND THIS CAR MAKES ALL KINDS OF SENSE
YOU1000000151_S0000122	WHAT A DAY
YOU1000000151_S0000124	AND WHAT AN AMAZING THREE CARS
YOU1000000151_S0000126	I SAT IN EACH OF THESE CRITIQUING THEM AND THINKING WE'RE SPLITTING HAIRS H
YOU1000000151_S0000127	WE ARE THIS IS WHISKER DIFFERENCES AND I I'M HONEST WHEN I SAY I CAME INTO THIS DAY WITH AN OPEN MIND TRULY I KIND OF THOUGHT I'D COME IN PICKING THE FRS AND I DIDN'T I LOVE THE FR
YOU1000000151_S0000128	GREAT CAR
YOU1000000151_S0000129	IT'S FANTASTIC BUT THE CAR I JUMPED INTO AND JUST STARTED SMILING I KNEW WAS THE WINNER FOR ME AND THAT WAS THE S TWO THOUSAND
YOU1000000151_S0000130	I WANTED THE FRS TO LIVE UP TO THE HYPE AND BE THE BEST CAR HERE AND I HAVE TO SAY I LOVE IT IT'S A GREAT CAR IT'S STILL A FOUR STAR IT' STILL IN MY TOP FIVE IT'S ALL OF THOSE THINGS BUT THE S TWO THOUSAND IS BETTER
YOU1000000151_S0000131	I CAN'T BELIEVE A CAR THAT'S TEN YEARS OLD IS STILL SO FANTASTIC THIS IS HANDA AT THE TOP OF THEIR GAME
YOU1000000151_S0000132	YEAH WHERE HAS THAT CAR GONE AND HANDA'S LINE UP I THAT'S THE CAR YOU KNOW ME I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF CONVERTABLES THAT'S THE CAR THAT WOULD MAKE ME BUY A CONVERTABLE I LIKE IT THAT YEA IT'S AN INCREDIBLE CAR
YOU1000000151_S0000133	WELL THESE TWO CARS ALSO ANSWERED THE BURNING QUESTION DOES THE FRS NEED MORE POWER
YOU1000000151_S0000135	NOW I'VE REALIZED IT SHOULD AND THESE CARS HAVE FORTY MORE HORSEPOWER
YOU1000000151_S0000137	AND THEY HAVE BETTER WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION SO THEY'RE A BIT MORE PREDICTABLE NOT THAT THE FRS IS BAD THOUGH
YOU1000000151_S0000139	I REALLY LIKE THIS CAR I SHOULD PUT IT ANOTHER WAY I RESPECT THIS CAR
YOU1000000151_S0000140	
YOU1000000151_S0000141	I CAN'T FALL IN LOVE WITH IT DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS ABOUT F THE OTHER TWO JUST SPARK ME I FALL IN LOVE WITH THOSE TWO CARS I'VE GOT TA PUT THE RX AT THIRD BUT NOT BECAUSE IT'S A BAD CAR IT'S A GREAT CAR IJUST NOT A REALLY FIS ME I ACTUALLY DON'T FEEL LIKE THAT IS AS POWERFUL AS I WANT IT TO BE
YOU1000000151_S0000143	WITH THE FRS BUT THE S TWO THOUSAND JUST PROVES OUT TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED POUNDS WITH TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY HORSEPOWER THAT RECIPE STARTS TO BE EXACT AND THIS ONE GETS CLOSE BUT IT JUST FALLS SHORT IF YOU DROVE THEM BY THEMSELVES
YOU1000000151_S0000145	FANTASTIC CAR YOU'D HAVE NO AWARENESS THAT IT COULD BE DIFFERENT OR BETTER
YOU1000000151_S0000146	AND OF COURSE OUR DECISIONS COULD BE WRONG AGAIN
YOU1000000151_S0000148	WITH THESE CARS THEY WILL BE WRONG SOMEONE WILL HATE US WILL BE SOMEONE WILL LOVE US TELL US IN THE COMMENTS WE WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU
YOU1000000151_S0000150	DON'T GET ME WRONG IT'S GREAT
YOU1000000151_S0000152	BUT IT ISN'T FIRST PLACE GREAT NOT COMPARED TO THESE OTHER TWO CARS THE FRS TIES THE S TWO THOUSAND FOR BEST STEERING FIELD THEY'RE BOTH GOOD AT DIFFERENT THINGS
YOU1000000151_S0000153	IT'S GOT MY SECOND FAVORITE GEAR BOX IT'S NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS THE ONE IN THE S TWO THOUSAND
YOU1000000151_S0000155	WHEN I DRIVE IT I FIND IT THE MOST ENDEARING IT TALKS TO ME THE MOST IT WARMS UP TO ME THE BEST IT'S THE CAR THAT I JUST WANT TO GET INTO IN ANY CONDITION AND THAT'S PRETTY REMARKABLE
YOU1000000151_S0000156	IF YOU CAN FIND AN R THREE IF YOU CAN FIND ONE FOR SALE
YOU1000000151_S0000158	BUY THIS CAR THE FASTER YOU GO THE MORE FUN YOU HAVE AND IT JUST IT TURNS INTO A RACE CAR
YOU1000000151_S0000159	I'M GENUINELY IMPRESSED BUT I DON'T LUST AFTER THIS CAR I DON'T WANT ONE AND I DO THE OTHER TWO
YOU1000000151_S0000160	FRANKLY I DIDN'T THINK THIS CAR WOULD WIN FOR ME BUT YOU REALIZE THIS REPRESENTS HANDA AT THE PEAK OF THEIR POWERS I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY HANDA HAS GONE COMPLETELY OFF THE RAILS
YOU1000000151_S0000161	AND GOTTEN AWAY FROM MAKING BRILLIANT DRIVING MACHINES LIKE THE S TWO THOUSAND

YOU1000000153_S0000023	YEAH I THINK I WANTED SOMETHING THAT WOULD KIND OF SINK INTO THE BACKGROUND SO NOTHING THAT WOULD STAND OUT TOO MUCH AND I LIKE THE THE CEDA THE NATURAL LOOK OF THAT AND I THINK WHILST IT CAN STILL SINK INTO THE BACKGROUND AND IT DOESN'T STAND OUT TOO MUCH IT'S REALLY QUITE STRIKING AND MODERN
YOU1000000153_S0000024	AND WE REALLY DID SPEND A LOT OF TIME WHEN WE WERE IN A BIGGER HOUSE WE SPENT A LOT MORE TIME IN OUR OUTDOOR AREA AS IT WAS SO WE KEPT THE SAME OUTDOOR AREA AND JUST MADE MADE A BIT MORE SPACE ESSENTIALLY THAN WHAT WE HAD THERE
YOU1000000153_S0000025	THAT'S IT SO ALL OF THE DECKING IS MODULAR SO GREG SPENT HOURS LABOURING AWAY WITH PALLETE WOOD AND EVERYTHING SO WE COULD KEEP THETHE COSTS DOWN AND MINIMIZE THAT FOOTPRINT ON ON EVERYTHING AS WELL SO
YOU1000000153_S0000026	WE'VE DONE THAT SO IF WE EVER NEED A MOVE WE CAN PULL IT ALL APART IT WOULD BE A DIFFICULT TASK IT WOULDN'T BE SIMPLE BUT IT CAN BE DONE AND WE CAN TAKE IT TO OUR NEXT PACKING SPOT
YOU1000000153_S0000027	REALLY GOOD SIZED WATER TANK HERE AS WELL

YOU1000000153_S0000029	COLOR BONB SO IT WASN'T PLASTIC WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR THE QUALITY OF WATER FOR US AND IT TIES IN REALLY NICELY WITH THE DESIGN OF THE HOUSE SO THAT WAS A BONUS

YOU1000000153_S0000031	YES EVERY SECOND WEEK FOR FIVE DAYS WE HAVE THEM MY SON WHO'S TURNING THIRTEEN THIS YEAR AND MY DAUGHTER WHO IS TEN WE THOUGHT THEY'D HAVE A BIT OF TROUBLE ADAPTING TO IT BUT IT WAS HONESTLY VERY SMOOTH WHEN WE INTRODUCE THEM TO THE HOUSE THEY GOT EXCITED AND THEN

YOU1000000153_S0000042	YEAH D COMFORT WAS THE MAIN GOAL WITH THIS SO WE FOUND THAT IN OUR REGULAR SIZED HOUSE WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THE LOUNGE ROOM ON THE COUCH WATCHING MOVIES PLAYING GAMES WITH THE KIDS SO WE NEEDED A COUCH THAT COULD ACCOMMODATE ALL FOUR OF US
YOU1000000153_S0000043	AND BE COMFORTABLE SO WE DESIGNED THE LAYOUT ACTUALLY OF THE LOUNGE ROOM BASED OFF THE SIZES OF THIS COUCH SO THE CHASE DOES DOUBLE AS STORAGE WHICH IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT IN YOUR TINY HOUSE
YOU1000000153_S0000045	THE BED OBVIOUSLY PULLS OUT FROM UNDER THERE AS WELL WHICH IS GREAT TO HAVE THAT EXTRA SLEEPING SPACE IF YOU NEED IT
YOU1000000153_S0000046	WE ACTUALLY FIND THAT WE SPREAD THAT OUT MORE OFTEN THAN YEAH WO IHAVE MORE FAMILY TIME REALLY WE SPEND MORE TIME WITH IT OUT JUST HANGING OUT LIKE THAT RATHER THAN JUST IN THIS EL SHAPED COUCH

YOU1000000153_S0000050	YEAH WE REALLY WANTED TO CAPITALIZE ON THE VIEW AND BRING IN AS MUCH NATURAL LIGHT AS POSSIBLE FOR A TINY HOUSE I THINK IF IT'S SMALLER CAN FEEL EVEN SMALLER IF IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT NATURAL LIGHT AND THAT JUST MAKES IT FEEL AIRY AND BRIGHT AND DOESN'T MAKE YOU FEEL SO COSTOPHOBIC I THINK
YOU1000000153_S0000052	AND THEN WE ALSO GET A BEAUTIFUL CROSS FREEZE WHICH IS ESSENTIAL IN THE HOT WEATHER HERE SO THAT HELPS AS WELL KEEPS THE PLACES COOL
YOU1000000153_S0000053	YEAH IT CERTAINLY IS ESSENTIAL BECAUSE THE WEATHER HERE YOU REALLY DO GET SOME EXTREMES DON'T YU
YOU1000000153_S0000055	IT I THINK IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS THE'VE HAD FLOODS AND DROUGHTS SO YOU KNOW THIS HAS BEEN A GREAT WAY TO BE ABLE TO STILL KEEP COOL AND KEEP THAT ELECTRICITY BILL DOWN SO YEAH
YOU1000000153_S0000056	AND THEN YOU'VE GOT A REALLY GOOD SIZED KITCHEN HERE
YOU1000000153_S0000057	YEAS SO WE DO A LOT OF MEAL PREPPING SO WE THOUGHT WE WOULD LIKE A BIG BENCH I THINK THAT WAS KEY FOR US BECAUSE WE DO THE MEAL PREPPING TOGETHER SO WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER IN THIS SPACE AT ONE TIME AND THEN IT ALSO DOUBLES AS A GREAT SPACE TO BE ABLE TO WORK AND HAVE OUR FOOD AS WELL
YOU1000000153_S0000058	STUDY SPACE SO ORIGINALLY WE MADE SURE TAT THIS BENCH SPACE THAT IS AT THE END HERE WAS MAINLY JUST SO THAT WE COULD DO WORK OR STUDY THERE AS WELL SO WE'VE GOT SPACE TO DO IT
YOU1000000153_S0000059	YEAH AND WE ALSO WANT TO HAVE A LOT OF OVERHEAD COVERED SPACE THERE AS WELL FOR STORAGE AND TO KEEP IT NICE AND TIDY RATHER THAN AN OPEN SHELVING JUST BECAUSE IT GETS QUITE DUSTY OUT HERE IN THE BUSH AREA
YOU1000000153_S0000060	AND IT'S SO LOVELY HOW THIS WINDOW HERE CAN JUST COMPLETELY OPEN THE KITCHEN UP TO THE OUT DOORS
YOU1000000153_S0000061	YEAH SO WE ACTUALLY DESIGNED A LOT OF THE HOUSE AROUND THAT BIFOLD WINDOW THERE AND WHEN IT OPENS UP IT REALLY DOES BRINGS THE OUTSIDE IN WE USE IT A LOT WITH
YOU1000000153_S0000062	IF WE HAVE FRIENDS OVER WE MEAL PREP HERE AND JUST HAND THE MEALS OVER OUT THERE AND WE CAN ALL STILL TALK AND AND COMMUNICATE TOGETHER AND THIS SORT OF STARTS TO FEEL MORE LIKE AN ISLAND BENCH IN THE KITCHEN RATHER THAN A WALL SEPARATING YOU GUYS AND IT'S REALLY COOL
YOU1000000153_S0000063	AND THEN REALLY GOOD SIZE APPLIANCES HERE IN THE KITCHEN FULL SIZED FRIDGE AND LOTS OF STORAGE THAT'S BEEN BUILT INTO THE STAIRS THERE TOO
YOU1000000153_S0000064	YES SO THIS WAS A LITTLE BIT TO GET IT TO WORK THE FRIDGE WAS FROM OUR PREVIOUS STANDARD HOUSE AND WE WANTED TO KEEP THAT JUST BECAUSE WE LIKED THE DESIGN OF THE FRIDGE SPACE BEING UP THE TOP WE'VE POPPED OUR MICROWAVE IN HERE WHICH IS
YOU1000000153_S0000065	KEEPING IT NICE AND WELL HIDDEN ALSO HAS EXTRA STORIES FOR CHOPPING BOARDS AND BREAD WHICH IS REALLY GREAT TO KEEP THE CABINETS NICE AND CLEAR UP HERE THE REST OF THE STORIY THOWR IS ACTUALLY FOR OUR CLOTHING AND THEN BEHIND THESE BASKETS WE'VE GOT QUITE A DEEP SPACE HERE

YOU1000000153_S0000067	YEAH AND BECAUSE WE LIKED A FOOD PREPS SO MUCH NOT DOWNSIZING ON THE OVEN WAS ESSENTIAL FOR US AS WELL SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KEPT THAT OVEN THE RIGHT SIZE WE DOWNGRADED TO THE TWO BURNER STOVE BUT THAT WASN'T AN ISSUE REALLY BECAUSE
YOU1000000153_S0000068	YHLIKE WE DO THINGS OUT OF A SLOW COOKER OR THE OVEN THE REST OF THE TIME SO IT WASN'T REALLY A PROBLEM
YOU1000000153_S0000069	AND THE OTHER STORIES THAT WE REALLY LOVE IN HERE IS ACTUALLY OUR PULL UP PANTRY SO A LOT OF WORK WENT INTO THAT AND WE ACTUALLY MEASURED OUT HOW THICK WE NEEDED IT TO BE TO FIT JARS IN AND EVERYTHING SO MAKE THE MOST OF THAT SPACE AS WELL
YOU1000000153_S0000070	THEN WE'VE GOT THE LOFT ABOVE US HERE
YOU1000000153_S0000071	YES SO THAT WAS ACTUALLY IN ADDITION THAT WE ADDED TO THE STANDARD DESIGN WITH THIS ONE WE NEEDED TO HAVE A SPACE FOR THE CHILDREN AS WELL SO THAT'S REALLY GREAT BECAUSE THEY CAN HAVE THEIR OWN SPACE AND BE APART FROM US BUT THEY ARE STILL PART OF THE FAMILY UNIT
YOU1000000153_S0000072	WE CHOSE NOT TO ENCLOSE IT JUST SO I COULD HAVE THAT OPEN FEEL AND ALSO TO LIMIT IT GETTING TOO HOT UP THERE WITH THE CROSS BREEZE AS WELL
YOU1000000153_S0000073	AND THEN THROUGH THERE WE HAVE YOUR BATHROOM AND IT'S REALLY NICE HOW YOU'VE CREATED THIS FULL LENGTH LUVA WINDOW
YOU1000000153_S0000074	YES THE WINDOW WE WANTED TO CREATE A SPACE I GUESS WHERE FROM ONE END OF THE HOUSE TO THE OTHER IT WAS REALLY OPEN ENDED SO WHEN YOU'RE SITTING IN THE LOUNGE ROOM AND LOOKING THROUGH
YOU1000000153_S0000075	YOU JUST SEE STRAIGHT OUT INTO NATURE AND IT DOESN'T JUST CUT THE HOUSE OFF AND FEEL LIKE IT SUDDENLY ENDS

YOU1000000153_S0000077	YEAS SO IT'S NOT QUITE THE SAME AS E NINE HUNDRED IT'S THINK EIGHT TWENTY BY EIGHT TWENTY SO A LITTLE BIT SMALLER THAN NORMAL BUT WE HAVE A BEAUTIFUL WATERFALL SHOWER HEAD WHICH MAKES IT REALLY LUXURIOUS TO HAVE A SHOWER IN THERE
YOU1000000153_S0000078	WE ALSO HAVE THE ADDITION OF ANOTHER LUVA WINDOW THERE JUST TO TRY BRING THE INSIDE OUT AGAIN AND ALSO TO EXTRACT SOME OF THAT STEAM WHICH CAN CAUSE A BIT OF TROUBLE IN A TINY SPACE AS WELL SO FEELS VERY LOVELY HAVING A SHOWR IN THERE ACTUALLY PROBABLY BETTER THAN OUR OLD OS

YOU1000000155_S0000000	REAL ESTATE INVESTING RULES OF THUMB THE TWO PERCENT RULE THE FIFTY PERCENT RULE AND THE SEVENTY PERCENT RULE
YOU1000000155_S0000001	THERE ARE SOME RULES OF THUMB THAT CAN HELP INVESTORS QUICKLY SCREEN THROUGH DEALS TO MAKE A GOOD EDUCATED GUESS ON WHETHER OR NOT TO PURSUE THEM
YOU1000000155_S0000002	NOW THIS IS IMPORTANT NOTICE THAT I DIDN'T SAY THERE ARE SOME RULES OF THUMB THAT CAN HELP INVESTORS MAKE PURCHASE DECISIONS
YOU1000000155_S0000003	BECAUSE RULES OF THUMB ARE NOT MEANT TO BE HARD AND FAST RULES THEY SIMPLY HELP AN INVESTOR GET A QUICK AND DIRTY OPINION ON SOME VALUABLE METRICS
YOU1000000155_S0000004	ALWAYS DO A PROPER ANALYSIS BUT REGARDLESS THESE RULES OF THUMB CAN COME IN REALLY HANDY IN SAVING YOU FROM ANALYZING EVERY SINGLE DEAL THAT YOU COME ACROSS
YOU1000000155_S0000005	MY NAME IS BRENDAN TURNER AND IN THIS VIDEO I'VE OUTLINED SEVERAL OF THE MOST COMMON REAL ESTATE MATH RULES OF THUMB
YOU1000000155_S0000006	SO YOU CAN BEGIN PRACTICING THEM IN YOUR OWN ANALYSIS OF PROPERTIES
YOU1000000155_S0000008	FIRST THE TWO PERCENT RULE ALSO KNOWN AS THE ONE PERCENT RULE OR THE TWO PERCENT TEST
YOU1000000155_S0000009	ERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON RULES OF THUMB USED BY RENTAL PROPERTY INVESTORS IS KNOWN AS THE TWO PERCENT RULE
YOU1000000155_S0000010	BUT NOT BECAUSE IT'S A RULE SO I SAY TWO PERCENT TEST I LIKE THAT BETTER
YOU1000000155_S0000011	ESSENTIALLY THIS RULE OF THUMB LOOKS AT THE MONTHLY RENT DIVIDED BY THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY IN A PERCENTAGE FORM
YOU1000000155_S0000012	FOR THOSE WHO JUST GOT CONFUSED LET'S MAKE THIS SUPER SIMPLE IF A PROPERTY RENTS FOR TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH
YOU1000000155_S0000013	AND THE VALUE IS TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THEN TWO THOUSAND DIVIDED BY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND EQUALS ONE PERCENT
YOU1000000155_S0000014	IN THIS EXAMPLE THE PROPERTY DOES NOT PASS THE TWO PERCENT TEST BUT IT DOES MEET THE ONE PERCENT TEST EXACTLY
YOU1000000155_S0000015	OR WHAT IF A PROPERTY THAT RENTS FOR FIFTEEN HUNDRED A MONTH AND IT COSTS A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND TO BUY WELL FIFTEEN HUNDRED DIVIDED BY A HUNDRED AD EIGHTY THOUSAND IS POINT EIGHT PERCENT
YOU1000000155_S0000016	THAT'S DEFINITELY SHORT OF THE ONE PERCENT RULE OR ONE PERCENT TEST NOW WHAT IF THAT PROPERTY RENTS FOR FIFTEEN HUNDRED A MONTH BUT IT'S WORTH A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUS
YOU1000000155_S0000017	WELL FIFTEEN HUNDRED DIVIDED BY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND EQUALS ONE POINT TWO FIVE PERCENT ALLRIGH SO YOU GET HOW THE MATH WORKS NOW RIGHT BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN
YOU1000000155_S0000018	WELL ESSENTIALLY THE ONE PERCENT OR TWO PERCENT TEST GIVES US A QUICK AND DIRTY VIEW ON WHETHER OR NOT THE PROPERTY WILL PRODUCE POSITIVE CASH FLOW
YOU1000000155_S0000019	AND OF COURSE JUST RULE OF THUMB IT ISN'T ALWAYS PRECISE BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING THE HIGHER THE PERCENTAGE THE BETTER THE CASH FLOW
YOU1000000155_S0000020	THIS ALSO GREATLY DEPENDS ON LOCATION PRICE AND HOW MUCH THE EXPENSES TRULY ARE ON THE PROPERTY
YOU1000000155_S0000021	THE RULE OF THUMB CAN HELP AN INVESTOR MAKE SOME DECISIONS ON WHETHER OR NOT TO PURSUE A CERTAIN PROPERTY
YOU1000000155_S0000022	FOR EXAMPLE I KNOW THAT MOST PROPERTIES THAT FALL SHORT OF ONE PERCENT WILL LIKELY NEVER PRODUCE A POSITIVE CASH FLOW FOR ME
YOU1000000155_S0000023	IF IT'S BETWEEN ONE AND TWO PERCENT IT PROBABLY WILL AND IF IT'S ABOVE TWO PERCENT WHICH IS REALLY HARD TO FIND TODAY THEN I'M ALMOST POSITIVE THAT IT WILL
YOU1000000155_S0000024	SO IF MY REAL ESTATE AGENT TELLS ME THAT THEY HAVE A PERFECT RENTAL HOUSE FOR ME TO BUY AND I SEE THAT THE PURCHASE PRICE IS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND
YOU1000000155_S0000025	AND I FINE THAT OLD RENT FOR A THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH I CAN MAKE A VERY QUICK DECISION AND I KNOW THAT MOST LIKELY THAT DEAL AIN'T GONNA EVER PROVIDE CASH FLO
YOU1000000155_S0000026	BECAUSE IT FALLS SHORT OF THE ONE PERCENT RULE BECAUSE A THOUSAND DIVIDED BY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND EQULS POINT EIGHT PERCENT
YOU1000000155_S0000027	IN A CASE LIKE THIS I PROBABLY WOULDN'T EVEN SPEND ANY MORE TIME LOOKING AT THE DEAL IF I WAS ONLY INTERESTED IN THE CASH FLOW
YOU1000000155_S0000028	SO THAT'S THE VALUE OF THE TWO PERCENT RULE TEST THING WHILE THE TWO PERCENT RULE AND THE ONE PERCENT RULE OR TEST WE JUST MENTIONED
YOU1000000155_S0000029	THEY CAN HELP YOU G WITH A LIKE GO NO GO DECISION ON LOOKING FURTHER INTO A RENTAL PROPERTY
YOU1000000155_S0000030	IT DOESN'T REALLY TELL US HOW MUCH CASHFLOW WE MIGHT EXPECT FOR THAT INVESTORS OFTEN RELY ON THE FIFTY PERCENT RULE OF THUMB
YOU1000000155_S0000031	THE FIFTY PERCENT RULE STATES THAT ON AVERAGE AND OVERTIME HALF OF THE INCOME IN A PROPERTY IS SPENT ON OPERATING EXPENSES
YOU1000000155_S0000032	NOW WHAT ARE OPERATING EXPENSES WELL GOOD QUESTION OPERATING EXPENSES ARE ALL OF THE EXPENSES INVOLVED WITH RUNNING A RENTAL PROPERTY
YOU1000000155_S0000033	EXCEPT THE LOAN PAYMENT SO IT INCLUDES TAXES INSURANCE UTILITIES REPAIRS VACANCY AND OTHER METRICS
YOU1000000155_S0000034	THAT LEAVE THE LANDLORD'S CHECKING ACCOUNT EVERY SINGLE MONTH OR EVERY YEAR DEPENDS ON HOW YOU WANT NO LOOK AT IT
YOU1000000155_S0000035	THE FIFTY PERCENT RULE CAN HELP AN INVESTOR QUICKLY ESTIMATE THE CASHFLOW OF A RENTAL PROPERTY BECAUSE IT COMBINES ALL OF THOSE EXPENSES EXCEPT FOR THE LOAN INTO ONE EASY NUMBER
YOU1000000155_S0000037	SO LET'S WORK THROUGH THIS IMAGINE A PROPERTY RENTSD FOR TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH THE FIFTY PERCENT RULE SAYS HALF OF THIS A THOUSAND WILL BE SPENT ON EXPENSES
YOU1000000155_S0000038	THIS MEANS WE'RE LEFT WITH A THOUSAND BUCKS BUT NOW WE NEED TO MAKE THE MORTGAGE PAYMENT ON THIS RIGHT UNLES YOU PAID CASH FOR THE PROPERTY BUT LET'S SAY YOU DIDN'T
YOU1000000155_S0000039	SO WITH THAT THOUSAND DOLLARS WE HAVE LEFT LET'S SAY THE MORTGAGE IS SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS SO HOW MUCH DO YOU HAVE LEFT FOUR HUNDRED BUCKS
YOU1000000155_S0000040	BECAUSE TWO THOUSAND TIMES FIFTY PERCENT EQUALS A THOUSAND A THOUSAND MINUS SIX HUNDRED FOR OPERATING EXPENSES IS FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS IN CASHFLOW
YOU1000000155_S0000041	THAT REMAINING NUMBER IS WHAT YOU CAN ESTIMATE OVER TIME ON AVERAGE YOU MIGHT GET IN MONTHLY CASHFLOW
YOU1000000155_S0000042	OF COURSE THAT FIFTY PERCENT ESTIMATE ON OPERATING EXPENSES CAN REALLY VARY WILDLY DEPENDING ON THE PROPERY
YOU1000000155_S0000043	IN SOME AREAS TAXES AND INSURANCE MIGHT BE INCREDIBLY HIGH BUT IN OTHER AREAS IT MIGHT BE MUCH LOWER SOME PROPERTIES REQUIRE THAT THE LANDLORD PAY ALL THE UTILITIES
YOU1000000155_S0000044	WHERE OTHER PROPERTIES ALLOW THE TENANT TO PAY THEIR OWN AND WHILE INHERENT WEAKNESSES DO EXIST
YOU1000000155_S0000045	THE FIFTY PERCENT RULE DOES HAVE VALUE I MEAN WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT A PROPERTY THAT RENTS FOR TWELVE HUNDRED BUCKS A MONTH
YOU1000000155_S0000047	AND YOU KNOW THE MORTGAGE PAYMENT WOULD BE AROUND A THOUSAND YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH GUARANTEE THAT PROPERTY WILL NOT PRODUCE A POSITIVE CASHFLOW
YOU1000000155_S0000048	CAUSE TWO HUNDRED BUCKS A MONTH IS NOT A LOT OF ROOM FOR ALL THOSE EXPENSES ECAUSE TWELVE HUNDRED TIMES FIFTY PERCENT EQUALS SIX HUNDRED
YOU1000000155_S0000049	SIX HUNDRED MINUS A THOUSAND IS NEGATIVE FOUR HUNDRED RIGHT NOW THE FIFTY PERCENT RULE HELPS KEEP REAL ESTAE INVESTORS IN CHECK
YOU1000000155_S0000050	AND TO REMIND US THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF EXPENSES THAT OVERTIME ADD UP YEAH I MEAN A NEW ROOF IS ONLY NEEDED EVERY TWENTY YEARS
YOU1000000155_S0000051	BUT IF YOU DIVIDE A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR ROOF INTO TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY MONTHS THAT ROOF IS ACTUALLY COSTING YOU FORTY TWO BUCKS A MONTH EVERY SINGLE MONTH
YOU1000000155_S0000052	THESE OPERATING EXPENSES ADD UP OVER TIME AND AS MOST INVESTORS HAVE SEEN THEY TEND TO SETTLE AROUND FIFTY PERCENT GIVING A LONG ENOUGH TIMEFRAME
YOU1000000155_S0000053	OKAY ON TO THE FINAL RULE OF THUMB TODAY THE SEVENTY PERCENT RULE
YOU1000000155_S0000054	THE LAST COUPLE RULES OF THUMB THAT WE TALKED ABOUT WERE DESIGNED TO HELP RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS BUT WHAT ABOUT THE HOUSE FLIPPERS THE WHOLESALERS I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE YOU GUYS OUT
YOU1000000155_S0000055	SO FOR THOSE WHO ARE FLIPPANT HOUSES THE SEVENTY PERCENT RULE CAN BE HELPFUL IN DETERMINING JUST HOW MUCH TO PAY FOR A PROPERTY
YOU1000000155_S0000056	THE SEVENTY PERCENT RULE STATES THAT THE MOST YOU SHOULD PAY FOR A POTENTIAL FLIP IS SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE AFTER REPAIR VALUE LIKE WHAT IT WOULD SELL FOR WHEN IT WAS ALL FIXED UP
YOU1000000155_S0000057	MINUS THE REPAIR COST SO EXAMPLE IF A HOLD WOULD SELL FOR THREE HUNDRED GRAND ALL FIXED UP AND THE PROPERTY NEEDED FIFTY GRAND WORTH OF WORK TO GET THERE
YOU1000000155_S0000058	THEN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND TIMES SEVENTY PERCENT IS TWO HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND SUBTRACT OUT THAT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND YOU'RE LEFT WITH ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY K
YOU1000000155_S0000059	ACCORDING TO THE SEVENTY PERCENT RULE THE MOST SOMEONE SHOULD PAY FOR THAT PROPERTY WOULD BE A HUNDRED AND SIXTY K BUT OF COURSE THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH THE SEVENTY PERCENT RULE
YOU1000000155_S0000060	THIS RULE OF THUMB ASSUMES THAT THIRTY PERCENT OF THE AR V THE AFTER REPAIR VALUE IS GOING TO BE SPENT ON HOLDING COST ON CLOTHING COSTS ON THE BUYING SIDE THE SELLING SIDE
YOU1000000155_S0000061	COMMISSIONS TAXES ATTORNEY FEES TITLE COMPANY FEES AND MORE AND THE FLIPPER'S PROFIT AND ANY OTHER CHARGES THAT COME UP DURING THE DEAL NOW THIS WORKS WELL IN SOME MARKETS
YOU1000000155_S0000062	UT IT HAS SOME SEVERE LIMITATIONS
YOU1000000155_S0000063	FOR EXAMPLE THE SEVENTY PERCENT RULE DOESN'T REALLY WORK THAT WELL FOR A PROPERTY WITH A REALLY LOW ARV AFTER REPAIR VALUE
YOU1000000155_S0000064	SUCH AS FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AS MENTIONED EARLIER THE THIRTY PERCENT DEDUCTED FROM THE ARV INCLUDES THE HOLDING COSTS AND THE CLOSHING COSTS AS WELL AS A PROFIT
YOU1000000155_S0000065	THE INVESTOR OR THE FLIPPER WANTS TO MAKE HOWEVER LIKE THIRTY PERCENT OF FIFTY GRAND IS LIKE FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS SO FOLLOWING THE SEVENTY PERCENT RULE
YOU1000000155_S0000066	ALL OF THE FEES COST AND PROFIT WOULD ONLY BE FIFTEEN GRAND
YOU1000000155_S0000067	IF THE FEES AND HOLDING COSTS WERE TO TOTAL LIKE TEN GRAND THAT WOULD LEAVE JUST FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN PROFIT FOR THE HOUSE FLIPPER
YOU1000000155_S0000068	AND I DON'T KNOW ANY HOUSE FLIPPER WHO'S GOINNA TAKE ON THE RISK OF FLIPPING A HOUSE FOR JUST FIVE GRAND
YOU1000000155_S0000069	SO FOLLOWING THE SEVENTY PERCENT RULE A FLIPPER OR WHOLESALER WOULD PAY FAR TOO MUCH FOR THE PROPERTY IN THIS EXAMPLE
YOU1000000155_S0000070	AND INVESTOR FLIPPING HOUSES AT THIS LEVEL MIGHT REQUIRE FAR LESS THAN SEVENTY PERCENT MAYBE A FIFTY PERCENT OR EVEN LOWER
YOU1000000155_S0000071	NOW A SIMILAR PROBLEM EXISTS WITH THE SEVENTY PERCENT RULE FOR MORE EXPENSIVE PROPERTIES
YOU1000000155_S0000072	THE SEVENTY PERCENT RULE WOULD DICTATE THAT A HOME WITH AN ARV OF SEVEN HUNDRED GRAND THAT NEEDS FIFTY GRAND TO WORK
YOU1000000155_S0000073	SHOULD PRODUCE A MAXIMUM OFFER OF FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND
YOU1000000155_S0000074	BUT IN MOST MARKETS FINDING A SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSANDOLLARS PROPERTY FOR FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND IS SIMPLY NOT FEASIBLE
YOU1000000155_S0000075	A PERSON WHO STICKS EXCLUSIVELY TO THAT SEVENTY PERCENT RULE ARE LIKELY NEVER GOINTO FIND A GOOD ENOUGH DEAL TO EVER FLIP A SINGLE PROPERTY IN THAT MARKET
YOU1000000155_S0000076	IN THIS CASE EIGHTY PERCENT OR EVEN EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT MIGHT BE GOOD ENOUGH
YOU1000000155_S0000077	FURTHERMORE SOME INVESTORS MAY SPEND MORE OR LESS ON FEES AND COSTS BECAUSE OF THEIR PARTICULAR LIFE SITUATION OR LOCATION
YOU1000000155_S0000078	FOR EXAMPLE IN SOME STATES PURCHASING A HOME MAY REQUIRE THREE GRAND AND CLOTHING COSTS WHILE IN OTHER STATES IT MIGHT BE SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS
YOU1000000155_S0000079	SOME INVESTORS MAY HAVE A REAL ESTATE LICENSE WHICH SAVES THEM TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN COMMISSIONS
YOU1000000155_S0000080	WHEREAS OTHER INVESTORS WELL THEY MAY NEED TO PAY COMMISSIONS WHEN THEY ACTUALLY SELL THE PROPERTY SO HOW SHOULD THE SEVENTY PERCENT RULE BE VALUED
YOU1000000155_S0000081	WELL CAREFULLY IT'S A QUICK AND DIRTY WAY TO ESTIMATE THE APPROXIMATE AMOUNT YOU SHOULD PAY FOR A PROPERTY
YOU1000000155_S0000082	BUT AS WITH ALL RULES OF THUMB NO CONCRETE DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE UNLESS YOU'VE RUN A REAL ESTATE ANALYSIS ON THE PROPERTY
YOU1000000155_S0000083	AND OF COURSE IF YOU WANT TO DO THAT CHECK OUT THE BIGGER POCKETS SUIT OF CALCULATORS YOU CAN GET THEM AT BIGGERPOCKETS DOT COM FORWARD SLASH KELK C AL C

YOU1000000161_S0000272	THANK YOU THIS IS FUN
YOU1000000162_S0000000	SO I MADE THAT VIDEO RECENTLY ABOUT THE APPLE AIRPODS THEY CAME BACK INTO MY LIFE I'VE BEEN USING THE AIRPODS AND KIND OF ENJOYING
YOU1000000162_S0000002	THEY'RE WILDLY SUCCESSFUL YOU SEE THEM OUT IN THE WORLD OTHER MANUFACTURERS THEY'RE ENTERING THE S PAE
YOU1000000162_S0000003	THIS IS THE LATEST INCARNATION OF THE FULLY WIRELESS SAMSONG EARBUD PRODUCT
YOU1000000162_S0000004	HAS A COUPLE OF FEATURES THAT HAVEN'T BEEN SEEN BEFORE PROBALY MY FAVORITE ONE IS THE FACT THAT THIS ENTIRE SETUP
YOU1000000162_S0000005	CHARGE FROM ANY PHONE THAT SUPPORTS WIRELESS CHARGE SHARING BECAUSE THIS IS A SAMSUNG PRODUCT AND THIS IS A SAMSUNG PHONE
YOU1000000162_S0000006	THERE'S ALSO SOME INTERPLAY THERE THAT'S A BIT SMOOTHER THAN IT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE WITH A THIRD PARTY PAIR OF EARPUDS PUDS
YOU1000000162_S0000007	BUT ONCE YOU'RE INTO THE APP THIS IS WHERE I THINK THEY HAVE A BIT OF AN ADVANTAGE OVER THE AIRPODS THEY'RE SUPER CONFIGURABLE
YOU1000000162_S0000008	HERE WE CAN SEE THE BATTERY LIFE OF EACH INDIVIDUAL UNIT YOU CAN USE ONE INDEPENDENTLY OF THE OTHER
YOU1000000162_S0000009	YOU CAN KEEP ONE OF THESE GUYS CHARGING IN THE CASE WHILE LISTENING TO THE OTHER ONE
YOU1000000162_S0000010	THERE'S SOME DIFFERENT EQUALIZER SETTINGS HERE FOR A BASE BOOST SOFT DYNAMIC CLEAR AND SO ON
YOU1000000162_S0000011	YOU CAN MANAGE HOW THESE THINGS DEAL WITH NOTIFICATIONS THEY DO HAVE TOUCH PADS ON THE SIDE UNLIKE THE AIRPODS
YOU1000000162_S0000012	THESE HAVE INTERCHANGEABLE EARTIPS AND EAR HOOKS AS WELL LOOK AT ALL THOSE OPTIONS
YOU1000000162_S0000013	THE AIRPOD YOU'VE SEEN IT BEFORE DOESN'T FIT THAT FAR INTO THE EAR CANAL FOR SOME PEOPLE THIS FITS REALLY WELL OTHERS IT WON'T STAY IN THEIR EARS
YOU1000000162_S0000014	THESE ON THE OTHER HAND ARE GOIN TA BE A BIT MORE PREDICTABLE BECAUSE THEY SIT FURTHER IN THE EAR CANAL AND THEY HAVE THAT SECONDARY RUBBER PLASTICY COMPONENT
YOU1000000162_S0000015	Y SHOULD JUST BE A BIT MORE SECURE IN THE'RE CONSIDERING THE WAY THAT THEY'RE DESIGNED
YOU1000000162_S0000016	AIRPOD IS A BIT TALLER BUT ALSO SLIGHTLY LESS CHUNKY THAN THE GALAXY BUTT
YOU1000000162_S0000017	SO PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW HEY WHICH ONE SHOULD I GET CONSIDERING THAT YOU CAN USE EITHER ON MULTIPLE PLATFORMS
YOU1000000162_S0000018	WORK AS BLUETOOTH HEADSETS YOU COULD USE THE AIRPODS ON ANDROID YOU COULD USE THE GALAXY BUDS ON IOS
YOU1000000162_S0000019	WITHIN THE APP THERE'S ALSO A FIND MY EARBUDS BUTTON SO THAT'LL TRACK THESE DOWN THESE THINGS COULD BE PRETTY EASY TO LOSE I MEAN THEY ARE TINY
YOU1000000162_S0000020	ALSO THERE'S A PRETTY COOL AMBIENT SOUND OPTION I CAN ACTUALLY ELEVATE THE VOLUME OF THE AMBIENT SOUND THE SOUND AROUND ME
YOU1000000162_S0000021	SO IT'LL BE AMPLIFIED INTO MY EAR SO I CAN HEAR MY SURROUNDINGS WHILE I'M LISTENING TO MUSIC PODCAST AUDIOBOOK AND SO
YOU1000000162_S0000022	NOW YOU CAN TOGGLE THAT ALL THE WAY DOWN SO THAT IT'S MUTED WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND ME IS MUTED
YOU1000000162_S0000023	YOU CAN HAVE AMBIENT IF YOU'RE ON HE BIKE YOU'RE CYCLING YOU NEED TO HEAR IF IF A CAR HUNKS IT'S HORN OR SOMETHING THIS CAN REALLY AMPLIFY YOUR SURROUNDINGS
YOU1000000162_S0000024	COURSE IT'S NOT ON THE AIRPODS THERE'S ALSO A VOICE FOCUS FEATURE IN THERE SO THIS LOOKS FOR VOICES SPECIFICALLY
YOU1000000162_S0000025	ALLOWS THEM TO CUT THROUGH TH THAT PARTICULAR FREQUENCY RANGE I FIND THIS TO BE USEFUL FROM TIME TO TIME
YOU1000000162_S0000026	NOW THE WAY THAT THE TOUCHPAD WORKS YOU CAN TAP TO PLAY OR PAUSE A TRACK DOUBLE TAP TO PLAY THE NEXT TRACK ANSWER OR END A PHONE CALL
YOU1000000162_S0000027	TRIPLE TAP TO PLAY THE PREVIOUS TRACK AND TOUCH AND HOLD TO USE A USER CONFIGURABLE USER'S CHOICE
YOU1000000162_S0000028	YOU COULD HAVE THAT LAUNCH SOMETHING SPECIFICALLY DO SOMETHING SPECIFICALLY AND THAT'S USER CONFIGURABLE THAT'S NICE
YOU1000000162_S0000029	NOW THAT I HAVE IT FOR QUICK AMBINT SOUND I'M GONNA TOUCH AND HOLD IT SEE IF I CAN LIGHTEN UP THE SURROUNDINGS HERE WE GO
YOU1000000162_S0000031	WHOW THAT'S COOL IT TOGGLES AMBIENT MODE WHILE YOU'RE HOLDING YOUR FINGER ON THE TOUCHPAD I'M IN AMBIENT RIGHT NOW I CAN TOTALLY HEAR MY CONVERSATION HEAR MY OWN VOICE NOW DO I LOOK A LITTLE STRANGE DOING THIS QUITE POSSIBLY
YOU1000000162_S0000032	UTTHE QUESTION YOU ALL HAVE IS LIKE HOW DO THEY STACK UP AGAINST THE AIRPODS NOW AS YOU GUYS KNOW I'M AN S TEN USER THIS IS THE DEVICE THAT'S CURRENTLY IN MY POCKET
YOU1000000162_S0000033	SO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EITHER OF THESE EARBUDS IT HAS TO BE IN CORRELATION TO THIS PARTICULAR DEVICE
YOU1000000162_S0000034	WE TALKED ABOUT SOME ADVANTAGES WITHIN THE APP WHO KNOWS I MIGHT BE WILLING TO GIVE UP THOSE EXTRA FEATURES IN EXCHANGE FOR POTENTIALLY BETTER SOUND I'M NOT REALLY SURE WE'LL
YOU1000000162_S0000035	TART WITH THE GALAXY BUDS I WANT TO MAKE SURE I'VE GOT MAXIMUM VOLUME OKAY SO NOW I KNOW I'VE GOT MAX VOLUME LITTLE SAMPLE
YOU1000000162_S0000036	ON
YOU1000000162_S0000038	
YOU1000000162_S0000040	WE'REIN SOFT RIGHT NOW DYNAMIC CLEAR BASE
YOU1000000162_S0000042	
YOU1000000162_S0000044	OKAY I'M WONDERING RIGHT NOW IF THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE TESTED THESE ALREADY HAD THEM IN FULL VOLUME OR NO
YOU1000000162_S0000045	CAUSE I READ SOME OF THOSE THINGS THAT YOU READ AND THAT WAS THE EXPERIENCE I WAS HAVING UNTIL I MADE SURE THE BUDDS THEMSELVES WERE MAX VOLUME AND THE PHONE WAS MAX VOLUME
YOU1000000162_S0000046	NOW IT'S A LOT MORE THUMP WAY MORE BASE ARE PEOPLE DOING IT WRONG
YOU1000000162_S0000048	IT'S A HEADPHONE I'M HEARING INSTRUMENTS I WAS GONE FOR A MINUTE DID THE TRICK SORT OF I'VE HEARD BETTER KIND OF FEEL LIKE I GOT TO DO THIS EXACT SAME TRACK RIGHT NOW ON THE AIRPOD
YOU1000000162_S0000049	RIGHT NOW WITHOUT FURTHER ADO HURRY U PURRY UP PURRY UP WAY LESS ISOLATION I HEAR THE THE FAN ON THE CAMERA HERE WE GO BEGINNING
YOU1000000162_S0000050	YOU KNOW NEITHER R R AR BLOWING MY BRAINS OUT YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY I'VE TRIED SOME VERY EXPENSIVE HEADPHONES IN THIS SPOT IN THIS SEAT RIGHT HERE
YOU1000000162_S0000051	DON IT TOGETHER YOU AND I JACK KIRK AND WHOEVER ELSE HAPPENS TO BE BEHIND MERE ON ANY GIVEN DAY THESE ARE TINY DENTAL FLOSS SITUATIONS LOOK AT THEM
YOU1000000162_S0000052	IN TERMS OF SOUND I THINK I CAN SAY BASED ON THAT QUICK LITTLE TEST RIGHT THERE THE BUDS
YOU1000000162_S0000054	THERE'S A BIT MORE THUMP TO IT MAYBE MY EXPECTATIONS WERE TOO HIGH
YOU1000000162_S0000055	THEY'RE PROBABLY CLOSER TO THIS PERFORMANCE THAN THEY ARE TO LIKE A FULL ON PAIRO HEADPHONE PERFORMANCE
YOU1000000162_S0000056	THAT SAID THE MOST STRIKING DIFFERENCE FOR ME BETWEEN THE TWO IS THE FIT THE AND THE FEEL
YOU1000000162_S0000057	AND THE SOUND SEAL I WHEN YOU PUT THESE ON YOU FEEL ISOLATED BUT THERE'S A DRAWBACK TO THAT I NOTICED THEY'RE IN MY EARS A LITTLE BIT MORE
YOU1000000162_S0000058	THIS I DON'T EVEN FEEL IT THIS IS A KIND OF A TIGHTER FEL IF I HAD TO CHOOSE THIS IS A BIT MORE COMFORTABLE FOR MY PARTICULAR EAR CANAL
YOU1000000162_S0000059	D THAT'S PART OF THE REASON I THINK I KEEP REACHING FOR THE AIRPODS IN THE FIRST PLACE NOT BECAUSE THEY SOUND THE BEST BUT BECAUSE YOU JUST DON'T EVEN NOTICE YOU'RE WEARING THEM THAT COULD BE A GOOD THING OR A BAD THING
YOU1000000162_S0000060	NEITHER ARE GOING TO BE AN AMAZING AUDIO EXPERIENCE BUT REALLY THESE PRODUCTS ARE ABOUT CONVENIENCE
YOU1000000162_S0000061	SO EVALUATING THEM ON CONVENIENCE YOU HAVE TO GIVE CERTAIN POINTS TO THE NEW SAMSUNG PRODUCT BECAUSE OF THEFECT THAT IT CAN CHARGE WIRELESSLY AND OFF OF THE PHONE ITSELF
YOU1000000162_S0000062	ALSO THE APP GIVES YOU MORE CONFIGURABILITY ALSO ANOTHER THING WORTH NOTING THE GALAXY BUDS ARE A BIT CHEAPER THAN THE AIR
YOU1000000162_S0000063	THAT'S NOT MUCH OF A SURPRISE THAT IS A HARD PICK I REALLY DON'T KNOW I MEAN IT MIGHT BE SO SIMPLE AS IF YOU'RE ON ON SAMSUNG OR ON ANDROID YOU MIGHT GO FOR THESE
YOU1000000162_S0000064	YOU'RE ON IOS YOU'LL PROBABLY GO FOR THESE JUST FOR THE EASIER PAIRING ACROSS DEVICES
YOU1000000162_S0000065	OH IT'S A HARD DECISION I'D SAY IF I'M ABOUT TO DO SOME KIND OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IF I'M GOING FOR A JOG OR SOMETIING I DON'T JOG BUT LIKE LET'S SAY I DID
YOU1000000162_S0000066	I WILL PROBABLY REACH FOR THESE ONES THERE'S JUST A BIT MORE CONFIDENCE IN THE FIT BUT IF IT'S JUST IF IT'S IN AN ENVIRONMENT LIKE AROUND THE HOUSE
YOU1000000162_S0000067	I ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE THE IDEA OF NOT FEELING THE THING IN YOUR EAR AS STUPID AS THAT LOOKS YOU FORGET THAT IT'S THERE
YOU1000000162_S0000068	I ALREADY HAVE SO MANY GREAT SOUNDING HEADPHONES IF I WANT TO GET DOWN TO BUSINESS WITH MUSIC I THINK I'LL PROBABLY STILL REACH FOR THESE MORE BECAUSE OF THAT FACTOR
YOU1000000162_S0000069	AND THEN ALSO KEEP MY SONY HEADPHONES THE DEDICATED OVER EAR HEADPHONES WITH THE NOISE CANCLLATION EVERHING ELSE
YOU1000000162_S0000070	KEEP THOSE FOR THE DISCERNING LISTENING BUT IF I DIDN'T HAVE THOSE OTHER HEADPHONES AND I NEEDED SOMETHING THAT COULD ISOLATE BETTER THAN THE AIRPODS
YOU1000000162_S0000071	AND I COULD ONLY HAVE ONE PAIR I ONLY HAD A HUNDRED AND THIRTY BUCKS FOR ONE PAIR I'D PROBABLY GO FOR THESE
YOU1000000162_S0000072	ONLY A ONE PAIR OF HEAD PHONES I PROBABLY WOULD CHOOSE THESE OVER THESE BUT IN CONJUNCTION WITH A REALLY NICE PAIR THAT YOU USE SOMETIMES
YOU1000000162_S0000073	THIS IS THE I DON'T EVEN NOTICE I'M WEARING THEM HEADSET THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE

YOU1000000166_S0000034	THE BABY VERSION OF A MEMBER OF YODA'S SPECIES WHO IS IN ONE EPISODE ALREADY THE MOST ENDEARING CHARACTER IN THIS FRANCHISE
YOU1000000166_S0000035	MOVE ASIDE PORGS GET THE BOOT EWAKS BABY YODA FILLED THE VOID THAT YOU NEVER COULD
YOU1000000166_S0000036	BABY YOTA IS LIKE CUTE CEPTION BUT THE KICKER IS THAT BY OUR STANDARDS HE'S NOT EVEN A BABY THE MANDOLORIAN DEPICTS HIM AS A FIFTY YEAR OLD TODDLER
YOU1000000166_S0000037	THEIR AGE THAT'S ALL YOU CAN GIVE ME
YOU1000000166_S0000038	YES THEY'RE FIFTY YEARS OLD
YOU1000000166_S0000039	BY STAR WAR STANDARDS THAT WOULD MAKE BABY YODA PART OF THE SILENT GENERATION AND BY THAT I MEAN THE ONE THAT CAME BEFORE THE BABY BOOMERS WHICH OF COURSE IN STAR WARS WERE ALL THE BABIES THAT WERE BORN RIGHT AFTER ALDERON WENT
YOU1000000166_S0000040	BOOM OKAY BOOMERS THERE'S ONE LESS PLANET IN THE GALAXY
YOU1000000166_S0000041	LISTEN THIS TOPIC HITS REALLY CLOSE TO HOME FOR ME BECAUSE I CURRENTLY OWN A TODDLER
YOU1000000166_S0000042	YOU'LL HEAR PARENTS SAYING STUFF LIKE I WISH THEY COULD STAY LITTLE FOREVER BUT HALF A CENTURY OF DIPER CHANGES IS SOMETHING NO ONE IS SIGNING UP FOR
YOU1000000166_S0000043	BUT ALL THOSE DIPERS AND MEMES GOT ME THINKING FIFTY YEARS IS A REALLY LONG TIME TO BE A BABY A RELATIVELY HELPLESS BABY
YOU1000000166_S0000044	ND I'M SAYING THAT AS A HUMAN THE SPECIES WITH THE LONGEST ADOLESCENCE ON THE PLANET SO HOW DOES THIS INSANELY LONG CHILDHOOD HAPPEN
YOU1000000166_S0000045	IS THERE ANY WAY THAT FIFTY YEARS OF TUMMY TIME COULD BE REMOTELY PLAUSIBLE SCIENTIFICALLY WELL I STARTED RESEARCHING AS I
YOU1000000166_S0000046	IT TURNS OUT THAT IT'S NOT JUST SCIENTIFIC PRECEDENT BUT AN EXPLANATION HERE FOR ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE ENTIRE YODA SPECIES
YOU1000000166_S0000047	THAT'S RIGHT UNDERSTANDING THE BIOLOGY OF BABY YOTA ISN'T JUST A FUN FACT FROM THE MANDALORIAN OR ME OVERTHINKING A CIFHI FRANCHISE
YOU1000000166_S0000048	IT'S THE SINGLE KEY TO UNDERSTANDING THE MOST BELOVED CHARACTER IN STAR WAR'S HISTORY
YOU1000000166_S0000049	AND WHY HE YODA BY THE TIME WE GET TO THE MAIN SERIES OF MOVIES IS PRETTY MUCH THE ONLY ONE OF HIS SPECIES LEFT
YOU1000000166_S0000050	GOT TO SAY BETWEEN THIS THEORY AND THE LAST ONE I DID OVER ON GAME THEORY ABOUT STAR WARS IS FORCE BEING PRETTY MUCH SCIENTIFICALLY ACCURATE WHICH IF YOU HAVEN'T WATH
YOU1000000166_S0000051	YOU ABSOLUTELY SHOULD AFTER THIS EPISODE I'M STARTING TO THINK THAT GEORGE LUCAS MIGHT SECRETLY BE A SCIENTIFIC GENIUS ALMOST LET'S NOT GIVE HIM TOO MUCH CREDIT
YOU1000000166_S0000052	SO JOIN ME AS I TAKE A LOOK INTO THE EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY OF BABY YOTA AND FINALLY FIGURE OUT WHY THEY'RE SO COOL AND ALSO WHY THEY'RE PRACTICALLY EXTINCT
YOU1000000166_S0000053	BEFORE WE OPEN YOUR BIOLOGY TEXTBOOKS TO CHAPTER FIVE WE NEED TO CLEAR THE AIR ON ONE THING NO I DON'T KNOW THE ACTUAL NAME OF THE SPECIES YODA COMES FROM
YOU1000000166_S0000054	BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M IN GOOD COMPANY BECAUSE GEORGE LUCAS DIDN'T EITHER GEORGE LUCAS SPECIFICALLY DIDN'T WANT YODA SPECIES TO HAVE A NAME
YOU1000000166_S0000055	RARELY SANCTIONED WORK THAT REVEALED INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR LORS SO EVEN THOUGH THE YODA SPECIES EXISTED IN PLACES LIKE NIGHTS OF THE OLD REPUBLIC THE VIDEO GAME INFORMATION ABOUT THEM DOESN'T APPEAR IN ANY
YOU1000000166_S0000056	THAT'S OFFICIALLY CANNON ANYMORE SO INSTEAD OF SPENDING THIS ENTIRE EPISODE SAYING THE WORD YODA AND HAVING TO CLARIFY BETWEEN WHETHER I'M TALKING ABOUT YODA THE SPECIES OR YODA THE INDIVIDUAL MEMBER OF THAT SPECIES
YOU1000000166_S0000057	I'LL INSTEAD BE REFERRING TO THE YODA SPECIES AS THE TRIDACTLE
YOU1000000166_S0000058	BECAUSE THEIR EXTREMITIES HAVE THREE DIGITS RIGHT BUT BEAR IN MIND THAT'S REALLY JUST A FAN MADE DESIGNATION FOR ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE YOTA SPECIES THAT WE'RE CURENTLY AWARE OF WHICH ARE JUST THREE
YOU1000000166_S0000059	HONESTLY YOU GOT ORIGINAL YODA YOU GOT YADLE FROM THE PHANTOM MENISE WHO JUST APPEARS FOR A COUPLE SECONDS AND BABY YODA WHATEVER HIS NAME ENDS UP BEING FROM THE MANDOLORI
YOU1000000166_S0000060	SO WITH THAT BIT OF HOUSEKEEPING OUT OF THE WAY AND WITH THE VERY SHORT LIST OF ACTUAL KNOWN MEMBERS OF THE YODA SPECIES WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT TRIDACTAL
YOU1000000166_S0000061	WE KNOW THAT YOTA LIVED TO THE RIPE OLD AGE OF NINE HUNDRED IN RETURN OF THE JETEI WHICH EVERYONE ELSE IS SURPRISED ABOUT BUT HE ISN'T SEEMING TO INDICATE THAT IT'S NOT REALLY THAT BIG OF A DEAL FOR
YOU1000000166_S0000062	BABY YOTA WHO'S JUST STUCK WITH THAT NAME FOR THIS EPISODE I GUESS IS FIFTY BUT FUNCTIONALLY HE'S ABOUT A TEN MONTH OLD
YOU1000000166_S0000063	IF MY KID IS ANY INDICATION HE'S NONVERBAL BUT HE IS CAPABLE OF WALKING AND GETTING INTO TROUBLE SO WE KNOW
YOU1000000166_S0000064	AS A TRIDACTOLE YOU GET NINE HUNDRED YEARS IN THE GALAXY ON THE HIGH END BUT AT LEAST
YOU1000000166_S0000066	FIRST FIFTY OF THEM ARE SPENT AS A BABY WHICH I GUESS LEAVES LIKE A HUNDRED TO MAKE IT THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL
YOU1000000166_S0000067	ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED YEARS OF LIVING IN YOUR PARENT' BASEMENT BEFORE FINALLY GETTING YOUR OWN APARTMENT AT THE TENDER AGE OF THREE HUNDRED
YOU1000000166_S0000068	NOW BECAUSE WE'RE WORKING IN OUTER SPACE AND IN A FICTIONAL FRANCHISE IT'S WORTH DOUBLE CHECKING WHEN THEY SAY THAT BABY YOTA IS FIFTY YEARS OLD IN THE MANDALORIAN
YOU1000000166_S0000069	DOES THAT TRANSLATE TO YEARS AS WE UNDERSTAND THEM HERE ON EARTH AND IT APPEARS LIKE IT DOES ACCORDING TO WIKIPEDIA THE REPUBLIC STANDARDIZED ITS TIME BASED ON CORISANT
YOU1000000166_S0000070	WHICH CONVENIENTLY ROTATES ITS SUN EXACTLY ONCE EVERY THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE CORSANTIAN DAYS WHICH ARE BROKEN DOWN THEMSELVES INTO TWENTY FOUR HOUR INCREMENTS
YOU1000000166_S0000071	AND THEN MINUTES THAT ARE INCREDIBLY CLOSE TO OUR OWN MINUTES SO WHEN YOTA SAYS THAT HE'S NINE HUNDRED YEARS OLD IT'S PRETTY CLOSE TO WHAT WE THINK NINE HUNDRED YEARS IS
YOU1000000166_S0000072	AND THE MANDOLORIAN HAS EVERY REASON TO BE SURPRISED THAT HIS FIFTY YEAR OLD MARK WAS STILL A BABY
YOU1000000166_S0000073	SO KNOWING THAT IT'S TIME TO TALK ABOUT THE BIOLOGY HAVING SUCH A LONG DEVELOPMENT PERIOD IS MORE THAN JUST AN INTERESTING EVOLUTIONARY QUIRK
YOU1000000166_S0000074	IT ACTUALLY TELLS US A LOT ABOUT HOW TRIDACTOLS MAY HAVE EVOLVED OVER TIME MOSTLY BECAUSE IT PARALLELS A LOT OF OUR OWN HUMAN EVOLUTION
YOU1000000166_S0000075	YOU SEE MOST ANIMALS EVOLVE TO SHORTEN THE AMOUNT OF TIME BETWEEN BIRTH AND REPRODUCTIVE MATURITY SO THAT THEY CAN GO ON AND GROW THEIR POPULATION AS FAST AS POSSIBLE
YOU1000000166_S0000076	BUT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY SUCCESSFUL EVOLUTIONARY STRATEGY YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT US HUMANS HAVE INCREDIBLY LONG AND PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE CHILDHOODS
YOU1000000166_S0000077	WHEN A BABY JERAPF IS BORN IT CAN STAND ALMOST ALMOST ALMOST RIGHT AWAY THE'RE SO CUTE HUMANS ON THE OTHER HAND NOT SO MUCH
YOU1000000166_S0000078	IT IS TAKING MONTHS IF NOT A YEAR FOR A BABY HUMAN TO ACTUALLY GET UP ON ITS FEET SO WHY DO HUMANS THE SMARTEST ANIMALS ON THE PLANET
YOU1000000166_S0000079	COME OUT SO USELESS
YOU1000000166_S0000080	ELL TURNS OUT THAT THE WHOLE ISSUE COMES DOWN TO OUR BRAINS YOU SEE OUR BRAINY HEADS AND THE FACT THAT THEY'RE SO FAT HAVE CHANGED OUR ENTIRE COURSE OF HUMAN EVOLUTION
YOU1000000166_S0000081	OUR ANCESTORS WHO MANY BELIEVE EMERGED FROM SUBSAHARAN AFRICA WERE AMONG THE FIRST SPECIES OF ANIMALS TO STOP WALKING AROUND ON FOURE LEGS
YOU1000000166_S0000082	START WALKING UP ON TWO OUR BRAINS WERE BIG ENOUGH THAT WE WERE ABLE TO LOGIC OUT THE IDEA THAT IT TOOK LESS ENERGY TO WALK ON TWO LEGS
YOU1000000166_S0000083	IT MINIMIZED OUR BALD SKINS EXPOSURE TO THE EXTREMELY HOT GROUND TEMPERATURES IN THOSE AFRICAN DESERT
YOU1000000166_S0000084	AS NEWLY BIPEDALE PEOPLE OUR EVOLUTION STARTED FAVORING OTHER MEMBERS OF OUR SPECIES WHO COULD ALSO WALK UPRIGHT GOOD FOR US NATURAL SELECTION AT ITS FINEST
YOU1000000166_S0000085	THERE'S ALWAYS A PRICE TO PAY FOR INNOVATION YOU SEE AS WE EVOLVE TO BE MORE AND MORE CAPABLE OF WALKING
YOU1000000166_S0000086	AND RUNNING AROUND ON TWO LEGS OUR BODIES EVOLVE TO FACILITATE THAT AND COMPENSATE FOR OUR CHANGED CENTER OF GRAVITY PRIMARILY DOING THIS BY NARROWING OUR HIPS
YOU1000000166_S0000087	THIS IN TURN HELPED US TO WALK UPRIGHT LIKE CHAMPS BUT NOW OF A SUDDEN WE HAD A PROBLEM THAT BIG FAT HEAD OF OURS WAS LITERALLY TOO BIG TO BE BORN
YOU1000000166_S0000088	SURE WE HAD OURSELVES A BIG BRAIN BUT NOW THERE WAS NOWHERE FOR IT TO GO BECAUSE OUR HIPS WERE TOO NARROW TO ACCOMMODATE BURING A HEAD THAT HUGE
YOU1000000166_S0000089	SO HUMAN EVOLUTION HAD TO CHANGE AGAIN AS THE THEORY GOES WE STARTED HAVING BABIES EARLIER IN THEIR GESTATIONAL PERIOD
YOU1000000166_S0000090	EARLIER AT A TIME WHEN THE BABY WAS STILL TINY AND SMOSHY AND HELPLESS WHICH WOULD BE PRETTY DARNE BAD FOR OUR SURVIVAL EXCEPT FOR ONE THING
YOU1000000166_S0000091	HE HEADS WERE STILL SMALL ENOUGH TO SQUEEZE UP ON OUT OF THERE STILL A VERY PAINFUL PROCESS BUT NOW AT LEAST IT WAS DOABLE
YOU1000000166_S0000092	AND THEN ONCE THE BABY WAS ON THE OTHER END THERE WOULD BE WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE FOURTH TRIMESTER
YOU1000000166_S0000093	AN EXTRA TRIMESTER OF DEVELOPMENT THAT HAPPENS OUTSIDE IN THE REAL WORLD WHERE WE AS PARENTS WOULD HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THAT HELPLESS NEWBORN
YOU1000000166_S0000094	BECAUSE TECHNICALLY IT STILL SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING IN THE WOMB IT JUST NEEDED TO BE YOU KNOW EVICTED FROM ITS HOME BEFORE IT WAS TOO BIG TO LEAVE ITS DOOR
YOU1000000166_S0000095	NOW LET'S TAKE A LOK AT OUR FRIENDLY YODA WHAT FEATURES DO WE SEE WELL HE'S BIPEDAL HE'S SMALL WITH A DISPROPORTIONATELY HUGE HEAD FOR HIS HIGHLY EVOLVED BRAIN
YOU1000000166_S0000096	HE'S GOT A SHORT HIGHLY EFFICIENT BODY WITH DIMINUATIVE NARROW FEATURES INCLUDING HIS HIPS EVEN LOOKING AT THE BASIC CHARACTER MODEL
YOU1000000166_S0000097	OU CAN SEE HOW IN ORDER TO PROCREATE THE TRIDACTALS WOULD HAVE TO HAVE THEMSELVES OF RADICALLY DIFFERENT PROPORTIONS
YOU1000000166_S0000098	CAN ALSO SEE HOW HAVING A BIG BRAIN IS A HUGE EVOLUTIONARY ADVANTAGE HUMANS ARE SO FAR AT THE TOP OF THE FOOD CHAIN THAT WE PROTECT OTHER MEMBERS OF THE FOOD CHAIN
YOU1000000166_S0000099	TRIDACTLS IN THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE ARE THE WISEST AND MOST POWERFUL FORCE USERS IN THE GALAXY
YOU1000000166_S0000100	THE DOWNSIDE IS THAT THEY LIKE US ARE ESSENTIALLY BORN TOO EARLY HELPLESS FOR MONTHS IF NOT YEARS OR UNTIL AT LEAST THEIR DAD MAKES AM PAY RENT
YOU1000000166_S0000101	D THEIR MOM STOPS DOING THEIR LAUNDRY THIS THEORY CONTINUES TO HOLD WATER IF WE LOOK AT INFANCY FOR HUMANS VERSUS INFANCY FOR TRIDACTALS IN THEIR FIRST TWO YEARS
YOU1000000166_S0000102	HUMAN BABY BRAINS GROW TO SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THEIR FULL ADULT SIZE WE DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS THE SAME FOR TRIDACTS
YOU1000000166_S0000103	BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THE PROPORTIONS OF HUMAN BABIES PARALLELD THE PROPORTIONS OF BABY YODA ENORMOUS HEAD ADORABLY TINY BODY
YOU1000000166_S0000104	BESIDES MAKING BABIES HILARIOUSLY TOP HEAVY THESE PROPORTIONS ALSO SERVE A FUNCTION IN INFANCY
YOU1000000166_S0000105	HUMAN BRAINS COMMAND UP TO EIGHTY SEVEN PERCENT OF THE TOTAL ENERGY THAT THE BODY USES AT REST
YOU1000000166_S0000106	MEANING THAT EVEN WHILE SLEEPING THE BODY IS DIVERTING A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF ENERGY TO GROWING THE BRAIN
YOU1000000166_S0000107	AUSE OF THIS THE REST OF THE BABY'S GROWTH LAGS BEHIND THE HEAD WHERE THE BRAIN IS THIS ACCORDING TO THE EXPENSIVE TISSUE HYPOTHESIS
YOU1000000166_S0000108	WE CAN SEE THAT BABY YODA IS AN EXTREME VERSION OF THIS PRINCIPLE WITH A WILDLY HUGE AND MERCHANDISABLE HEAD
YOU1000000166_S0000109	AND A TEENY TINY BODY MAKING ME THINK THAT BABYE YOTA IS AN EXTREMELY EVOLVED VERSION OF WHAT THE HUMAN RACE COULD LOOK LIKE SOMEDAY
YOU1000000166_S0000111	PROCESS OF EVOLUTIONARILY ELONGATING THE DEVELOPMENT PERIOD IS CALLED NIOT
YOU1000000166_S0000112	AND AFTER HUMANS BENEFITED FROM IT SURVIVING WHEN OUR RELATIVES DIDN'T WELL EVOLUTION DIDN'T STOP ITS ROLE
YOU1000000166_S0000113	HUMANS ARE ACTUALLY STILL EXPERIENCING LONGER DEVELOPMENT PERIODS NOW THAN WE EVEN DID TEN THOUSAND YEARS AGO
YOU1000000166_S0000114	THE SHAPE OF OUR FACES AND HEADS ARE CONTINUALLY BECOMING LESS LIKE OUR NEANDERTHALL COUSINS BY BECOMING FLATTER LESS HAIRY LESS OBLONG
YOU1000000166_S0000115	AGAIN WE SHARE A LOT OF THESE SAME FEATURES WITH OTA WHO'S SMALL FLAT FACED WITH AN ENORMOUS HEAD BUT IF HUMAN EVOLUTION CONTINUES TO MAKE OUR CHILDHOODS LONGER AND LONGER
YOU1000000166_S0000116	E QUESTION OF COURSE BECOMES WHERE DOES IT STOP WELL IT STOPS AT YODA
YOU1000000166_S0000117	THE PROBLEM WITH A LONG CHILDHOOD IS THAT A LOT CAN HAPPEN WHEN YOU'RE TINY AND HELPLESS
YOU1000000166_S0000118	EVENTUALLY THERE'S AN EVOLUTIONARY TIPPING POINT WHERE CHILDHOOD BECOMES SO LONG THAT IT ACTUALLY LEAVES THE SPECIES TOO VULNERABLE TO SURVIVE INTO ADULTHOOD
YOU1000000166_S0000119	TRIDACTALS COULD VERY WELL BE THE EXTREME END POINT OF A SPECIES LIKE OURS
YOU1000000166_S0000120	S THE MANDOLORION CLEARLY SHOWS BABY TRIDACTALS EVEN FIFTY YEAR OLD BABY TRIDACTOLS AREN'T CAPABLE OF TAKING CARE OF THEMSELVES
YOU1000000166_S0000121	SURE THEY HAVE IMPRESSIVE FORCE POWERS BUT VERY LITTLE CONTROL OVER THEM
YOU1000000166_S0000123	HUMAN CHILDREN SIMILARLY ARE PRETTY DARN HELPLESS AND IT MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO DO THINGS LIKE BABY PROOF THE HOUSE AND MAKE UP ALL KINDS OF SAFETY RULES FOR KIDS
YOU1000000166_S0000124	IMAGINE HAVING TO WRRY ABOUT THAT SORT OF STUFF FOR FIFTY OR EVEN A HUNDRED YEARS IT BECOMES EXTREMELY HARD FOR THE SPECIES TO GET THEIR OFFSPRING TO A PLACE OF SELF SUFFICIENCY
YOU1000000166_S0000125	AND THAT'S JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG NATURAL DISASTERS PLAGUES DRONE ATTACKS FROM THE EMPIRE
YOU1000000166_S0000126	ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE GOINGNA BE PRETTY DARN HARD TO AVOID BUT THEY BECOME A LOT EASIER TO BOUNCE BACK FROM IF SUDDENLY YOUR SPECIES CAN REPOPULATE QUICKLY
YOU1000000166_S0000127	BUT IF ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'RE SPENDING A HUNDRED YEARS OR MORE TO REPRODUCE A SINGLE GENERATION
YOU1000000166_S0000128	I MEAN YOU'RE JUST BEGGING FOR THE NEXT DEATH STAR TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE ZAP WHICH BRINGS US TO YODA
YOU1000000166_S0000129	E KNOW SO LITTLE ABOUT HIS HISTORY BUT WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO THEORIZE IS PRETTY DARN INCREDIBLE HE'S PRACTICALLY THE LAST OF HIS SPECIES
YOU1000000166_S0000130	BECAUSE OF THE EVOLUTIONARY DOUBLE EDGED SWORD THAT HE'S DEALING WITH ON ONE HAND HE'S ONE OF THE MOST HIGHLY EVOLVED BEINGS IN THE GALAXY
YOU1000000166_S0000131	BUT HE'S SO EVOLVED THAT HIS SPECIES CAN NO LONGER SURVIVE THEY'RE COMPLETELY OBSCURE
YOU1000000166_S0000132	IT'S INCREDIBLY TRAGIC AND NO WE DON'T HAVE ANY OF THE DETAILS ABOUT HOW THE TRIDACTALS WERE WIPED OUT BUT THAT ELONGATED CHILDHOOD
YOU1000000166_S0000133	HAT EXTENDED NEOTNY TO THE EXTREMES OF FIFTY PLUS YEARS OF CHILDHOOD THAT IS CERTAINLY A MASSIVE CONTRIBUTOR
YOU1000000166_S0000134	AS TO WHY SO INCREDIBLY STAR WARS THE SERIES OFTEN DERIDED AS BEING SPACE FANTASYE
YOU1000000166_S0000135	N NOT SCIENCE FICTION TURNS OUT TO BE SCIENTIFICALLY PLAUSIBLE YET AGAIN SO GOT A HAND IT TO YOU LUCAS I'M PRETTY STUNNED

YOU1000000167_S0000002	READ BY JIM BROADBAND
YOU1000000167_S0000004	YOU COULD TELL CHRISTOPHER ROBBIN HAD SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO SAY FROM THE WAY HE CLASPED HIS KNEES TIGHTLY AND RIGGLED HIS TOES
YOU1000000167_S0000006	EVERYBODY GATHERED ROUND AND LOOKED AT HIM EXPECTANTLY

YOU1000000167_S0000010	OH THE QUEEN SAID POO BEIR MUCH RELIEVED THE OTHER PEOPLE YOU MENTIOND SOUNDED MUCH TOO TALL AND FEARSOME BUT THE QUEEN IS QUITE DIFFERENT
YOU1000000167_S0000011	POU HAD ONCE SENT A LETTER AND WAS TOLD TO STICK ON A SMALL PICTURE OF THE QUEEN IT STUCK MORE TO HIS NOSE THAN TO THE LETTER
YOU1000000167_S0000012	BUT IT TOLD THE POSTMAN THAT IT WAS MOST URGENT AND THAT THE QUEEN SAYS IT MUST BE SENT AND SO HE WAS SURE IT HAD BEEN
YOU1000000167_S0000014	AS I WAS SAYING SAID CHRISTOPHER ROBBIN PASSING POO A HONEY SANDWICH SO THAT HE MIGHT CONTINUE SPEAKING
YOU1000000167_S0000015	HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IS CELEBRATING AN IMPORTANT BIRTHDAY HER NINETIETH BIRTHDAY AND WE SHOULD TOO CELEBRATE
YOU1000000167_S0000016	THAT IS BY GIVING HER A PRESENT

YOU1000000167_S0000020	TO IN FACT IF I MAY BOAST A LITTLE
YOU1000000167_S0000022	ONE WAS RATHER SMALL AND DAMP AND THE OTHER SOMEWHAT LARGER AND STICKY
YOU1000000167_S0000024	I DON'T LIKE TO COMPLAIN
YOU1000000167_S0000026	A PRESENT IS SOMETHING AND TO HAVE TWO IS SOMETHING ELSE
YOU1000000167_S0000028	BOTH POO AND PIGLET BLUSHED SLIGHTLY THEY HAD A MEMORY OF A WONDERFUL BALLOON AND A LARGE JAR OF THE BEST HONEY
YOU1000000167_S0000029	THAT HAD BEGUN AS EXCEEDINGLY GOOD PRESENTS AND THEN
YOU1000000167_S0000030	DUE TO VARIOUS MISHAPS HAD BECOME RATHER DISAPPOINTING PRESENTES
YOU1000000167_S0000031	BUT WHICH WERE PRESENTS NEVERTHELESS AND AS EOR HAD SAID THAT WAS SOMETHING
YOU1000000167_S0000033	THE QUESTION IS SAID RABBIT IMPORTANTLY WHAT DO QUEENS LIKE BEST
YOU1000000167_S0000035	HONEY I SHOULD THINK SIGHED POO LOOKING AT THE SMALL STICKY CRUMB WHERE THE HONEY SANDWICHES HAD ONCE BEEN
YOU1000000167_S0000037	I'VE HEARD SAID CHRISTOPHER ROBBIN WHO KNEW A GREAT DEAL ABOUT FARAWAY PLACES LIKE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FOREST AND LONDON
YOU1000000167_S0000038	THAT THE QUEEN HAS A GRAND TEA EVERY DAY IN HER PALACE WITH BUTTERED TOAST AND CRUMPITS
YOU1000000167_S0000039	SO I SHOULDN'T THINK WE'D NEED TO GIVE HER ANYTHING TO EAT HER PRESENT SHOULD BE SOMETHING TO TREASURE
YOU1000000167_S0000041	I'VE NEVER HAD MUCH LUCK FINDING TREASURE SIGHED POO

YOU1000000167_S0000046	BUT THAT FINDING IT AGAIN WAS AN ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT THING
YOU1000000167_S0000048	SUDDENLY THE FOREST SEEMED TO BE FULL OF STICKS THAT COULD OR COULD NOT BE THE NORTH POLE
YOU1000000167_S0000050	THIS WILL NEVER DO ANNOUNCED RABBIT

YOU1000000167_S0000055	A QUEEN LIVED IN HER PALACE AS QUEENS OFTEN DO
YOU1000000167_S0000057	DOING ALL THOSE BUSY THINGS THT BUSY QUEENS DO
YOU1000000167_S0000059	BUT THE QUEEN COULD NEVER KNOW AS YOU AND I DO
YOU1000000167_S0000061	DOING NOTHING MUCH CAN BE THE BEST THING TO DO
YOU1000000167_S0000063	SO FROM A FOREST FAR AWAY FOR YOUR SPECIAL DAY
YOU1000000167_S0000065	SENDING YOU SOME QUIET AND A LITTLE TIME TO PLAY
YOU1000000167_S0000067	AND QUIET THERE WAS
YOU1000000167_S0000069	THE SORT OF QUIET THAT MAKES THE TIP OF YOUR NOSE TURN A SUNSET SHADE OF PINK

YOU1000000167_S0000076	AND IOR WILL DELIVER IT TO BUCKINGHAM PALACE AND PIGLET MUST COME TOO BECAUSE LONDON IS A VERY BIG PLACE INDEED
YOU1000000167_S0000077	AND EVEN SMALL ANIMALS IF THEY ARE VERY GOOD FRIENDS CAN MAKE EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT
YOU1000000167_S0000079	AND SO IT WAS DECIDED AND OWL WAS CALLED FOR OWL FUSSED HERE AND FUSSED THERE
YOU1000000167_S0000081	AND USED UP A GOOD DEAL OF TIME PAPER AND INK BUT AT LAST IT WAS DONE AND EVERYONE ADMIRED ITOH

YOU1000000167_S0000084	AND LASTLY A THISTLE KINDLY DONATED BY EOR
YOU1000000167_S0000086	CHRISTOPHER ROBBIN ALSO FOUND A BEAUTIFUL BRIGHT RED BALLOON WHICH HE THOUGHT THE QUEEN MIGHT ENJOY ON GRAY DAYS
YOU1000000167_S0000087	PIGLET YOU SHOULD HOLD IT HE SAID THAT WAY WE WON'T LOSE YOU IN THE CROWD
YOU1000000167_S0000089	PIGLET HELD ON VERY TIGHTLY TO THE BALLOON HE WASN'T QUITE SURE WHAT A CROWD WAS SOMETHING LIKE A DARK CLOUD PERHAPS
YOU1000000167_S0000090	BUT IN ANY CASE HE DIDN'T WANT TO GET LOST IN IT AND WAS PLEASED THE BALLOON WOULD HELP
YOU1000000167_S0000092	SO THE PRESENTS WERE READY AND SIDE BY SIDE WINNY THE POO EDWARD BEAR BEAR OF VERY LITTLE BRAIN BRAVE ADVENTURER
YOU1000000167_S0000093	AND LOYAL FRIEND HIS SMALL COMPANION PIGLET EOR AND CHRISTOPHER ROBBIN SET OFF FOR LONDON

YOU1000000167_S0000097	FTHE SEA ASKED POO SOMEWHAT ALARMED
YOU1000000167_S0000099	NOT THE SEA I SHOULDN'T THINK REPLIED CHRISTOPHER ROBBIN WHOSE GEOGRAPHY LESSONS SO FAR HAD BEEN MOSTLY SPENT COLORING IN EDGI BITS
YOU1000000167_S0000100	BUT CERTAINLY THE COUNTRY OR COUNTY I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHICH IN ANY CASE IT IS VERY FAR OFF AND WE SHALL HAVE TO CATCH A TRAIN
YOU1000000167_S0000102	I DO HOPE IT WANTS TO BE CAUGHT SAID POO WHO WAS ALREADY A LITTLE OUT OF PUFF FROM THE WALK BUT THE TRAIN WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO STOP FOR THEM IN THE STATION
YOU1000000167_S0000103	SO THERE WAS NO CATCHING TO BE DONE AT ALL AND THERE WAS PLENTY OF TIME TO CLIMB ABOARD AND FIND FOUR COMFY SEATS
YOU1000000167_S0000104	AND THEN THEY WERE OFF
YOU1000000167_S0000106	WOULD YOU BE SO KIND AS TO STAY VERY CLOSE BYE ASKED AN ANXIOUS PIGLET AS THEY GOT OFF THE TRAIN AT VICTORIA STATION
YOU1000000167_S0000107	HE HADN'T EXPECTED LONDON TO HAVE QUITE SO MANY LEGS
YOU1000000167_S0000109	WERE PIN STRIPED LEGS BIG BOOTED LEGS AND SOME LEGS BALANCED ON POINTY SHOES WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE A LITTLE STICK STUCK TO THE BOTTOM OF EACH SOLE
YOU1000000167_S0000111	THEY WERE ALL IN A TERRIBLE RUSH AND SEEMED TO KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THEY WERE GOING
YOU1000000167_S0000113	CHRISTOPHER ROBBIN POO PIGLET AND EOR LAUNCHED THEMSELVES INTO THIS VAST FOREST OF LEGS AND HOPED THEY'D COME OUT ALL RIGHT
YOU1000000167_S0000115	THEY EMERGED INTO A BUSY STREET
YOU1000000167_S0000117	CHRISTOPHER ROBBIN TOLD THEM THAT THE LARGE BLACK VEHICLES RUSHING PAST WERE CALLED TRAFFIC
YOU1000000167_S0000119	WHO THOUGHT THAT TRAFFIC LOOKED LIKE GIANT SHINY BEETLES AND THINKING OF THEM AS BEETLES MADE IT LESS WORRYING
YOU1000000167_S0000121	THE FRIENDS WALKED AND THEY WALKED
YOU1000000167_S0000122	BUT IO'S SIGHS THAT HAD STARTED OUT AS SMALL PUFFS WERE NOW GROWING SO LARGE AND LOUD
YOU1000000167_S0000123	THAT THEY WERE WORRIED HE WOULD RUN OUT OF PUFF ALTOGETHER AND WINNIE THE POO'S LEGS WERE KNOWN FOR THEIR STOUTNESS NOT THEIR BRISK WALKING
YOU1000000167_S0000124	AND PIGLET'S LEGS WERE SO SHORT THAT THEY WERE HARDLY WORTH SPEAKING OF AT ALL
YOU1000000167_S0000126	SO CHRISTOPHER ROBBINS SUGGESTED THEY RIDE ON A BUS THE REST OF THE WAY TO BUCKINGHAM PALACE
YOU1000000167_S0000128	MOST CONSIDERATE I'M SURE SIGHED EOR
YOU1000000167_S0000130	ALTHOUGH SLIGHTLY LESS PUFFILY THIS TIME

YOU1000000167_S0000133	AND UP AT THE TOP THERE WAS NO ROOF AT ALL
YOU1000000167_S0000135	AS THE BUS BEGAN TO MOVE THE WIND DID ITS BEST TO BLOW PIGLET'S EARS RIGHT OFF AND HE NEARLY LOST HOLD OF THE BALLOON
YOU1000000167_S0000136	WE'LL CALL THIS THE BLUSTERY BUS LAUGHED CHRISTOPHER ROBBIN
YOU1000000167_S0000138	THE BUS TOOK THE FRIENDS PAST A GREAT MANY IMPORTANT BUILDINGS
YOU1000000167_S0000140	D CHRISTOPHER ROBBIN DIDN'T KNOW ALL THE NAMES
YOU1000000167_S0000142	HERE WAS ONE VERY GRAND OLD SHOP WHICH POO FOUND STRANGELY FAMILIAR BUT HE TOLD HIMSELF HE WAS BEING SILLY

YOU1000000167_S0000205	THE QUEEN WAS SO CLOSE THAT THEY COULD HAVE REACHED OUT AND TOUCHED HER FINE COAT
YOU1000000167_S0000207	WINNIE THE POO KNEW THAT IT WAS NOW OR NEVER

YOU1000000168_S0000035	THIS FOX'S BEHAVIOR CAN BEST BE DESCRIBED AS A CROSSWAY BETWEEN THAT OF A DOG AND A CAT
YOU1000000168_S0000037	THEY'RE USUALLY PLAYFUL AND ENERGETIC LIKE A DOG BUT JUST AS EQUALLY INDEPENDENT LIKE A CAT SO YOU'LL BE FINE LEAVING THEM HOME ALONE FOR A FEW HOURS
YOU1000000168_S0000039	WHAT SETS THEM APART THOUGH IS THAT THEY DON'T REALLY FAVOR DOG NOR CAT TOYS THIS EXOTIC ANIMAL CAN LIVE UP TO FIFTEEN YEARS
YOU1000000168_S0000040	IT IS LEGAL TO OWN IN MOST OF AMERICA WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW STATES BUT HEY IF YOU'RE DYING TO OWN ONE YOU CAN ALWAYS JUST MOVE TO ANOTHER STATE

YOU1000000168_S0000062	SOUTH AMERICAN CHINCHILLA CAN BOND VERY CLOSELY WITH ITS CARETAKER
YOU1000000168_S0000064	BUT UNFORTUNATELY IS ONE OF THE MORE DESTRUCTIVE RODANTS
YOU1000000168_S0000066	THAT'S NOT TO SAY THEY'RE DANGEROUS OR ANYTHING THEY JUST DON'T LIKE TO BE CUDDLED
YOU1000000168_S0000067	NO NO NO NO NO NO OW OW OW O BIT ME HARD

YOU1000000169_S0000129	SO STARVING SO SO HUNGRY
YOU1000000169_S0000131	DO THINK IT'S GREAT THE WAY THAT THE DOG SENSES ARE USED TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE FROM POLLER BEARS THEY'VE GOT EXCELLENT HEARING FANTASTIC SENSE OF SMELL
YOU1000000169_S0000132	AND THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO TECHNOLOGY IN THE WORLD THAT CAN DETECT POLAR BEARS AS GOOD AS A DOG CAN
YOU1000000169_S0000134	IT'S A SMALL SIGN OF HOPE THERE ARE WAYS TO KEEP BOTH PEOPLE AND POLAR BEARS SAFE
YOU1000000169_S0000136	MAX IS A RED COLLY CROSS NORMALLY FULL OF ENERGY AND ENTHUSIASM
YOU1000000169_S0000137	BUT IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT HIS OWNER MOURINE BURNS NOTICED THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG
YOU1000000169_S0000139	I THOUGHT AT THE TIME MAX WAS FADING HE WAS NINE AND A HALF
YOU1000000169_S0000141	AND I WAS PREPARING MYSELF FOR LOSING HIM BECAUSE OF HE JUST WASN'T HAPPY WOULDN'T COME WITH ME WOULDN'T SIT BY ME WOULDN'T SIT ON MY LAP
YOU1000000169_S0000143	AND THE ODD SIGNS HE WOULD COME UP
YOU1000000169_S0000145	UND TOUCH MY BREAST WITH HIS NOSE
YOU1000000169_S0000147	AND BACK OFF SO DESPERATELY UNHAPPY WITH SUCH A SAD LOOK IN HIS EYES
YOU1000000169_S0000149	MARINE HAD A SMALL LUMP IN HER BREAST BUT HER LATEST MAMMAGRAM WAS CLEAR SO SHE PRESUMED ALL WAS OKAY
YOU1000000169_S0000151	INITIALLY I THOUGHT IT'S JUST ANOTHER LUMPY BREAST AS PEOPLE GET
YOU1000000169_S0000153	BUT THEN
YOU1000000169_S0000155	I SORT OF CONNECTED IT WITH THE DOG WITH HIS ODD BEHAVIOUR AND ONE DAY I WAS LOOKING IN THE MIRROR IN THE BEDROOM HERE
YOU1000000169_S0000157	AND I LOOKED ACROSS IN THE MIRROR AT MAX'S EYES HE WAS ON THE BED AS HE IS NOW AND I KNEW IT WAS CANCER
YOU1000000169_S0000159	MARINE WENT TO HER LOCAL HOSPITAL BUT BOTH A SCAN AND A MAMMOGRAM CAME BACK NEGATIVE
YOU1000000169_S0000161	IT TOOK A SURGICAL BIOPSY TO FINALLY DETECT THE CANCER
YOU1000000169_S0000163	MORINE HAD IT REMOVED AND THE CHANGE IN MAX'S BEHAVIOUR WAS INSTANT
YOU1000000169_S0000165	THE DAY I WAS PICKED UP FROM THE HOSPITAL
YOU1000000169_S0000167	HE WAS HIS OLD HYPERSELF AGAIN
YOU1000000169_S0000169	PUT HIS NOSE ACROSS MY BREAST TO CHECK WHERE THE OPERATION HAD BEEN AND HE WAS WAGGING HIS TAILE AND HIS EYES WERE HAPPY AND
YOU1000000169_S0000170	IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE THE CHANGE IN HIM INSTANT
YOU1000000169_S0000172	I LOVE MAX SO MUCH AND I OWE HIM SO MUCH
YOU1000000169_S0000174	AND EVEN BEFORE I GO FOR A CHECKUP NOW I GET HIM TO CHECK ME OUT AND IF HE'S HAPPY AND WAGGING HIS TAIL I AM HAPPY
YOU1000000169_S0000175	AND I KNOW I'M OKAY
YOU1000000169_S0000177	WE NOW KNOW THAT DOGS LIKE MAX ARE SMELLING THE TINY VOLATILE CHEMICALS GIVEN OFF BY CANCEROUS TUMOURS
YOU1000000169_S0000179	MOST DOGS CAN DO THIS THEY JUST DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE INTERESTED
YOU1000000169_S0000181	BUT WITH A LITTLE TRAINING DOGS CAN ACCURATELY PICK OUT A CANCEROUS PATIENT FROM A SELECTION OF URINE SAMPLES
YOU1000000169_S0000182	G GA A GOOD GAL
YOU1000000169_S0000184	THEY CAN EVEN BE TAUGHT TO LET DIABETICS LIKE STEPHEN KNOW THAT HIS BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS ARE SMELLING LOW LONG BEFORE HE CAN FEEL IT
YOU1000000169_S0000185	AND DEFINITELY BEFORE HE PASSES OUT
YOU1000000169_S0000187	DOGS LIKE STEPHENS ARE NOW TRANSFORMING LIVES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
YOU1000000169_S0000188	THEY'RE BEING TRAINED TO DETECT THE EARLY WARNING SIGNALS FOR SEVERE ALLERGIC REACTIONS EPILEPTIC FITS AND NARCALEPSY
YOU1000000170_S0000001	I WORKED AT THIS PLACE C W I
YOU1000000170_S0000002	AND FOR MY R THEN CURRENT PROJECT WHICH WAS THE AMEBA OPERATING SYSTEM WHICH I WAS WORKING UNDER SAPA MELANDER
YOU1000000170_S0000003	ONE OF OUR PROJECTS WAS TO WRITE APPLICATION LEVEL UTILITIES
YOU1000000170_S0000004	FOR THIS NEW AMEBA OPERATING SYSTEM
YOU1000000170_S0000005	AND SO THERE WAS AN OPERATING SYSTEM CURNEL AND IT WAS VERY GOOD AT TALKING TO THE NETWORK
YOU1000000170_S0000006	AND IT WAS VERY GOOD AT MANAGING PROCESSES BUT THERE WASN'T MUCH USER LEVEL SOFTWARE
YOU1000000170_S0000007	THERE WAS BARELY A SHELL I THINK THERE WAS A PORTED VERY OLD UNIX SHELL SOMETHING LIKE THE ORIGINAL VERSION UNIX VERSION SIX SHELL
YOU1000000170_S0000008	BUT BECAUSE THE FILE SYSTEM MODEL ON AMEBA WAS SO VERY DIFFERENT
YOU1000000170_S0000009	HWE COULDN'T TAKE AN EXISTING SUITE OF UNIX UTILITIES
YOU1000000170_S0000010	AND SO WE WANTED IT TO BE SELF HOSTING
YOU1000000170_S0000012	AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE REALIZED WE NEEDED A LARGE AMOUNT OF USER LEVEL SORT OF APPLICATIONS UTILITIES TOOLS
YOU1000000170_S0000013	WHATEVER YOU CALL IT FROM A FROM AN EDITOR TO A MAIL PROGRAM TO A LOG IN UTILITY AND A BACKUP TOOL
YOU1000000170_S0000014	AND ONE OF THE THINGS I REALIZED AS WE HAD A SMALL TEAM OF PEOPLE SORT OF WORKING ON THOSE THINGS
YOU1000000170_S0000015	THAT IT WAS VERY SLOW GOING WRITING ALL THAT STUFF IN C AND IT WASN'T PARTICULARLY INTERESTING OR SORT OF NOVEL
YOU1000000170_S0000016	OR DIFFICULT AND OFTEN WE ALSO DIDN'T REALLY CARE HOW FAST THE CODE RAN
YOU1000000170_S0000017	ALL THE REASONS WHY YOU WOULD WRITE A PIECE OF SOFTWARE IN C DIDN'T REALLY APPLY
YOU1000000170_S0000018	TH ONLY REASON LEFT WAS THAT C WAS THE ONLY LINGUA LANGUAGE THAT FOR WHICH WE HAD A COMPILER
YOU1000000170_S0000019	THERE WAS THIS ABC LANGUAGE THAT I HAD IN THE BACK OF MY MIND THAT WOULD BE A MUCH BETTER LANGUAGE TO WRITE
YOU1000000170_S0000020	A WHOLE BUNCH OF UTILITY APPLICATION TOOLS FOR AMEBA
YOU1000000170_S0000021	EXCEPT THAT ABC WAS SO HIGH AND ABSTRACT THAT IT REALLY
YOU1000000170_S0000023	IT' IT WASN'T A GOOD LANGUAGE TO TALK TO SERVERS AND FILE SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES
YOU1000000170_S0000024	AND ITS SORT OF THE WHOLE OPERATING SYSTEM THING WAS ABSTRACTED AWAY FROM ABC
YOU1000000170_S0000025	IT WAS ALMOST SOMETHING LIKE IT I DON'T KNOW IN A IFIN AN ALTERNATE UNIVERSE ABC COULD HAVE BECOME THE LANGUAGE OF SPREADSHEETS
YOU1000000170_S0000026	IT WAS VERY GOOD TO FOR TALKING ABOUT A USER'S DATA
YOU1000000170_S0000027	AND DOING ALL SORTS OF CLEVER STUFF WITH THAT DATA
YOU1000000170_S0000028	AND IT DID THAT USING VERY SORT OF GENERAL ALL PURPOSE DATA STRUCTURES LIKE LISTS AND DICTIONARIES
YOU1000000170_S0000029	AND OF COURSE IT HAD VERY NICE CODE STRUCTURING DEVICES
YOU1000000170_S0000030	LIKE A SMALL NUMBER OF SIMPLE STATEMENTS THAT COULD BE COMBINED IN ANY WAY YOU WANTED TO CREATE OTHER CONSTRUCTS
YOU1000000170_S0000031	THE USUAL FUNCTION AND PROCEDURE ABSTRACTIONS
YOU1000000170_S0000032	IT WAS NOT AT ALL AN OBJECT ORIENTED LANGUAGE ALTHOUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION HAD SOME OBJECTS SORT OF SHINING THROUGH
YOU1000000170_S0000033	ANYWAY ABC AS
YOU1000000170_S0000035	AS IT EXISTED STILL WASN'T USABLE
YOU1000000170_S0000036	BUT I SOMEHOW SINCE I HAD WORKED ON THE ABC PROJECT I KNEW EXACTLY HOW IT WAS BUILT
YOU1000000170_S0000037	AND I HAD THIS IDEA IN MY HEAD THAT
YOU1000000170_S0000039	GIVEN HOW MUCH TIME WE HAD AVAILABLE FOR OUR PROJECT I COULD ACTUALLY BUILD A WHOLE NEW LANGUAGE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT IT FROM SCRATCH
YOU1000000170_S0000040	GIVEN WHAT I LEARNED ABOUT BOTH THE DESIGN AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ABC AND START USING IT TO IMPLEMENT OUR SUITE OF TOOLS
YOU1000000170_S0000041	AND STILL BE AHEAD OF THE GAME COMPARED TO A SITUATION WHERE WE WOULD JUST HAVE SORT OF
YOU1000000170_S0000043	CLUNKE ON WRITING THE THINGS WE WANTED TO WRITE IN C
YOU1000000170_S0000044	FOR THREE MONTHS
YOU1000000170_S0000046	I I DID MY DAY JOB AND AT NIGHT AND WHENEVER I GOT A CHANCE I KEPT WORKING ON PYTHON
YOU1000000170_S0000047	I BELIEVED THAT WITHIN THREE MONTHS I WAS TO THE POINT WHERE I COULD TELL PEOPLE LOOK HERE THIS IS WHAT I BUILT
YOU1000000170_S0000048	AND IT HAD AN INTERACTIVE INTERPRETER LOOP
YOU1000000170_S0000049	SO TTHE FIRST DEMOS WERE ALL LET'S ASSIGN AN EXPRESSION TO A VARIABLE AND PRINT IT BACK
YOU1000000170_S0000051	AND LET'S DEFINE A SMALL FUNCTION AND CALL IT AND LET'S PUT SOME LET'S PUT SOME THINGS IN AN ARRAY AND ITERATE OVER THE ARRAY
YOU1000000170_S0000053	AND ALL THOSE THINGS WORKED
YOU1000000170_S0000055	AND
YOU1000000170_S0000057	SOMEHOW AND II I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW SORT OF HOW FAST THIS HAPPENED BUT
YOU1000000170_S0000059	CERTAINLY MY TWO OFFICEMATES WERE ALMOST INSTANTLY TAKEN WITH IT AND STARTED HELPING OUT
YOU1000000170_S0000061	AND THEY AND A FEW OTHERS WITHIN THE INSTITUTE WERE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS THING THAT I'D BUILT
YOU1000000170_S0000063	AND STARTED SORT OF
YOU1000000170_S0000065	OF COURSE WE WE DIDN'T INSTANTLY USE IT ON AMIBA BECAUSE IT WASN'T MATURE ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY WRITE THE AMIBA UTILITIES THAT WE WANTED
YOU1000000170_S0000066	BUT IT WAS ALREADY INSTANTLY USEFUL ENOUGH FOR OUR TO TO RUN ON OUR UNIX SYSTEM
YOU1000000170_S0000067	PEOPLE WITHIN C I EVEN OUTSIDE MY OWN DEPARTMENT STARTED USING IT
YOU1000000170_S0000068	AND RECOGNIZING THAT IT WAS FUN AND PRODUCTIVE TO USE AND THEY USED IT FOR SMALL SCRIPTS
YOU1000000170_S0000069	N PEOPLE STARTED CONTRIBUTING THINGS LIKE
YOU1000000170_S0000071	BUG FIXES SOMEHOW THINGS WENT WENT VERY QUICKLY DURING THAT FIRST YEAR
YOU1000000170_S0000072	BECAUSE I THINK BY THE END OF NINETEEN NINETY SO A YEAR AFTER I STARTED WE DEVELOPED A PLAN TO DO AN OPEN SOURCE RELEASE OF THIS LANGUAGE
YOU1000000170_S0000074	AND THIS WAS BEFORE THE WORD OPEN SOURCE HAD EVEN BEEN COINED
YOU1000000170_S0000075	SO WE DIDN'T CALL IT THAT BUT WE DID HAVE SOME MODELS WE HAD LIKE A
YOU1000000170_S0000077	X ELEVEN THE WINDOW SYSTEM AT THE TIME
YOU1000000170_S0000078	HAD A DISTRIBUTION THAT WAS ONE OF THE THE SORT OF OPEN SOURCE EXAMPLES
YOU1000000170_S0000079	WITH TWO COLLEAGUES I WORKED ON SORT OF BUILDING A DISTRIBUTION AND WE WE
YOU1000000170_S0000080	ACTUALLY I IT TURNED OUT TO BE VERY SIMPLE
YOU1000000170_S0000081	TO GET MANAGEMENT TO SIGN OFF ON THIS RELEASE
YOU1000000170_S0000083	THAT' THAT WAS AN INCREDIBLY LUCKY STROKE
YOU1000000170_S0000084	I JUST SORT OF
YOU1000000170_S0000086	I ASKED MY MANAGER'S MANAGER WHAT SHALL WE DO ABOUT THIS
YOU1000000170_S0000087	AND HE SAID OH YOU GOTTA TALK TO THIS AND THIS PERSON IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE BRANCH OF THE INSTITUTE
YOU1000000170_S0000088	AND I TALKED TO THIS WOMAN AND SHE WAS LIKE IN CHARGE OF ALL LEGAL AFFAIRS I BELIEVE
YOU1000000170_S0000089	AND I SAID WELL I HAVE WRITTEN THIS SOURCE CODE AND I WOULD LIKE TO RELEASE THAT AND I HAVE SORT OF
YOU1000000170_S0000090	MADE UP A LICENSE THAT'S LIKE IDENTICAL TO THE MIT LICENSE I COULD SAY MIT RELEASES SOFTWARE UNDER EXACTLY THIS LICENSE
YOU1000000170_S0000091	WE JUST PUT LIKE THE FORMAL NAME OF OUR INSTITUTE IN THERE INSTEAD OF THE REGIONS OF THE INSTITUTE
YOU1000000170_S0000092	SHE ASKED ME SOME QUESTIONS LIKE
YOU1000000170_S0000094	DID SOMEONE PAY FOR TI FOR THIS TO BE DEVELOPED AND MY ANSWER WAS NO II STARTED THIS ALL IN MY OWN MY OWN TIME
YOU1000000170_S0000095	AND IT WAS FOR THIS RESEARCH PROJECT THAT' SORT OF
YOU1000000170_S0000097	MY MANAGER'S FINE WITH T
YOU1000000170_S0000099	AND SO SHE SAID SURE GO AHEAD AND WE DID IT
YOU1000000170_S0000101	AND THAT'S SO THAT IN IN FEBRUARY NINETY ONE WE DID THE FIRST PYTHON RELEASE
YOU1000000170_S0000103	IT FELT LIKE AT THE TIME LIKE AN INCREDIBLE MILESTONE WE NEEDED TO POST IT TO USENAT
YOU1000000170_S0000104	THERE WAS THIS USENET NEWS GROUP THAT WOULD RECEIVE SOURCE CODE FOR RANDOM FREE PROJECTS
YOU1000000170_S0000105	I O IMMEDIATELY STARTED GETTING USEFUL POSITIVE FEEDBACK FROM WELL INITIALLY JUST FROM RANDOM PEOPLE
YOU1000000170_S0000106	PICKED UP FREE SOFTWARE FROM USNET AND
YOU1000000170_S0000107	WE WE QUICKLY SORT OF GOT INTO A ROUTINE OF DOING NEW PYTHON RELEASES
YOU1000000170_S0000108	AND EVERY TIME
YOU1000000170_S0000110	I MEAN THERE WERE THE OBVIOUS IMPROVEMENTS TO THE LANGUAGE AND THE LIBRARY AND BUG FIXES AVERY IMPORTANT CATEGORY OF THINGS THAT WERE OFTEN CONTRIBUTED
YOU1000000170_S0000111	WERE PORTS OR PORTING FIXES WHERE PEOPLE HAD DIFFERENT ARCHITECTURES DIFFERENT COMPILERS
YOU1000000170_S0000112	THTHE THE UNIX WORLD WAS MUCH LESS HOMOGENEOUS AT THE TIME THERE WERE LOTS OF SMALL UNICH VENDORS THAT HAD THEIR OWN COMPILERS OR THEIR OWN HARDWARE
YOU1000000170_S0000113	ALL SORTS OF THINGS SO THA THE BIG THINGS THAT HAPPEND
YOU1000000170_S0000114	DURING SAY THE FIRST HALF OF THE NINETY S WAS A COMMUNITY OF PYTHON USERS AND DEVELOPERS SELF ORGANIZED
YOU1000000170_S0000115	THEN CAME THE INVITATION TO COME TO THE UNITED STATES FOR A COUPLE MONTHS
YOU1000000170_S0000117	FROM NIST THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY SO I SPENT TWO MONTHS THERE
YOU1000000170_S0000118	AD WE ORGANIZED THE FIRST PYTHON WORKSHOP WHICH WAS HOSTED BY NIST
YOU1000000170_S0000119	THROUGH THAT PYTHON WORKSHOP I MET PEOPLE WHO OFFERED ME A JOB AND FROM NINETY FIVE I MEAN I WENT BACK TO THE NETHERLANDS FOR A FEW MONTHS AND THEN FROM NINETY FIVE TO TWO THOUSAND
YOU1000000170_S0000120	I WORKED IN THE US IN NORTHERN VIRGINIA AT CNRI
YOU1000000170_S0000122	AND SO THERE WE WORKED THROUGH A LOT OF GROWTH OF THE COMMUNITY AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE CREATED THE PYTHON WEBSITE
YOU1000000170_S0000123	I GOT IN TOUCH WITH A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL ACTIVE IN THE PYTHON COMMUNITY LIKE BRRY WARSAW
YOU1000000170_S0000124	I THINK WHEN I STARTED THERE PYTHON ONE POINT THREE WAS ABOUT TO BE RELEASED
YOU1000000170_S0000126	AND THEN WHILE I WAS THERE WE RELEASED SEVERAL SUBSEQUENT VERSIONS LEADING UP TO ONE FIVE TWO
YOU1000000170_S0000127	WHICH FOR SOME REASON ONE ONE FIVE ZERO WAS NOTHING
YOU1000000170_S0000128	ONE FIVE TWO REMAINED THAT SORT OF THE STANDARD THE GOLD STANDARD OF PYTHON FOR A VERY LONG TIME AFTERWARDS
YOU1000000171_S0000001	BUT GET BACK TO THE STANDARDIZATION WE ARE STANDARDIZING C PLUS PLUS UNDER ISO RULES WHICH ARE VERY OPEN PROCESS
YOU1000000171_S0000002	PEOPLE COME IN THERE'S NO REQUIREMENTS FOR EDUCATION OR EXPERIENCE
YOU1000000171_S0000003	YOU'E STARTED TO DEVELOP SPPLUS PLUS AND THERE IS A HOPE WHEN WAS THE FIRST STANDARD ESTABLISHED WHAT IS THAT LIKE
YOU1000000171_S0000004	THE ISOL STANDARD IS THERE A COMMITTEE THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO THERE'S A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHAT WHAT'S THAT LIKE HOW OFTEN DO YOU MEET WHAT'STHE
YOU1000000171_S0000005	I'LL TRY AND EXPLAIN THAT SO SOMETIME IN EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY S NINE
YOU1000000171_S0000006	TWO PEOPLE ONE FROM IBM ONE FROM H P TURNED UP IN MY OFFICE AND TOLD ME I WOULD LIKE TO STANDARDIZE C PLUS PLUS
YOU1000000171_S0000008	THIS WAS A NEW IDEA TO ME AND I POINTED OUT THAT IT WASN'T FINISHED YET IT WASN'T READY FOR FORMAL STANDARDIZATION AND
YOU1000000171_S0000009	UCH AND THEY SAY NO BIANA YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN IT UYOU REALLY WANT TO DO THIS OUR ORGANIZATIONS DEPEND ON CPLUS PLUS
YOU1000000171_S0000010	WE CANNOT DEPEND ON SOMETHING THAT'S OWNED BY ANOTHER CORPORATION THAT MIGHT BE A COMPETITOR OF COURSE WE COULD RELY ON YOU
YOU1000000171_S0000011	BUT YOU MIGHT GET RUN OVER BY A BUS
YOU1000000171_S0000013	WE REALLY NEED TO GET THIS OUT IN THE OPEN IT HAS TO BE STANDARDIZED UNDER FORMAL RULES
YOU1000000171_S0000014	AND WE WE ARE GOING TO STANDARDIZE IT UNDER ISO RULES
YOU1000000171_S0000015	AND YOU REALLY WANT TO BE PART OF IT BECAUSE BASICALLY OTHERWISE WE'LL DO IT OURSELVES
YOU1000000171_S0000017	AND WE KNOW YOU CAN DO IT BETTER SO THROUGH A COMBINATION OF ARM TWISTING AND FLATTERY
YOU1000000171_S0000019	SO IN LATE
YOU1000000171_S0000021	IN LATE EIGHTY NINE THERE WAS A MEETING IN DC AT THE ACTUALLY NO IT WAS NOT ISO THEN IT WAS ANI
YOU1000000171_S0000022	THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARD WERE DOING
YOU1000000171_S0000024	WE MET THERE WE WERE LECTURED ON THE RULES OF HOW TO DO AN ANTI STANDARD THERE WAS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE OF US THERE
YOU1000000171_S0000025	WHICH APPARENTLY WAS A NEW RECORD FOR THAT KIND OF MEETING UAND SOME OF THE OLD SEA GUYS THAT HAS BEEN STANDARDIZDIN SEA WAS THERE SO WE GOT SOME EXPERTISE IN
YOU1000000171_S0000026	SO THE WAY THIS WORKS IS THAT IT'S AN OPEN PROCESS ANYBODY CAN CAN SIGN UP IF THEY PAY THE MINIMAL FEE
YOU1000000171_S0000027	WHICH IS 'S ABOUT A THOUSAND DOLLARS THERA LESS THAN IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE NOW
YOU1000000171_S0000028	AND I THINK IT'S TWELVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DOLLARS IT'SNOT IT'S NOT GOING TO KILL YOU AND WE HAVE THREE MEETINGS A YEAR
YOU1000000171_S0000029	IS IS FAIRLY STANDARD WE TRIED TWO MEETINGS A YEAR FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS THAT DIDN'T WORK TOO WELL SO THREE MEETIN THREE ONE
YOU1000000171_S0000031	WEEK MEETINGS A YEAR
YOU1000000171_S0000033	AND YOU MEET AND YOU HAVE TECHNICAL MEET TECHNICAL DISCUSSIONS AND THEN YOU BRING PROPOSALS FORWARD FOR VOTES
YOU1000000171_S0000034	THE VOTES ARE DONE ONE PERSON PER
YOU1000000171_S0000036	ONE VOTE PER ORGANIZATION SO YOU CAN'T HAVE SAY IBM COME IN WITH TEN PEOPLE AND DOMINATE THINGS THAT'S NOT ALLOWED
YOU1000000171_S0000037	AND THESE AE ORGANIZATIONS THAT EXTENSIVELY USE CPLUS PLUS
YOU1000000171_S0000039	AR INDIVIDUALS
YOU1000000171_S0000040	INDIVIDUALS I MEAN IT'S A IT'S HE'S A BUNCH OF PEOPLE IN A ROOM DECIDING THE DESIGN OF A LANGUAGE BASED ON WHICH A LOT OF THE WORLD'S SYSTEMS RUN
YOU1000000171_S0000041	THAT'S RIGHT WELL I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD AGREE IT'S BETTER THAN IF I DECIDED IT
YOU1000000171_S0000042	OR BETTER THAN IF A SINGLE ORGANISATION LIKE CND T DECIDED IT
YOU1000000171_S0000043	I DON'T KNOW IF EVERYONE AGREES TO THAT BY THE WAY BUREAUCRACIES HAVE THEIR CRITICS TOO
YOU1000000171_S0000044	YES THEY THEY THE LOOK STANDARDIZATION IS NOT PLEASANT IT'S ITS ITIT'S IT'S HORRIFYING
YOU1000000171_S0000045	IT'S LIKE DEMOCRACY
YOU1000000171_S0000046	UT WE EXACTLY AS CHURCHILL SAYS DEMOCRACY IS THE WORST WAY EXCEPT FOR LL THE OTHERS RIGHT
YOU1000000171_S0000047	AND IT'S I WOULD SAY THE SAME WITH FORMAL STANDARDIZATION BUT ANYWAY SO WE MEET AND WE WE HAVE THESE VOTES
YOU1000000171_S0000049	AND THAT DETERMINES WHAT THE STANDARD IS A COUPLE OF YEARS LATER WE EXTENDED THIS SO IT BECAME WORLDWIDE
YOU1000000171_S0000050	WE HAVE STANDARD ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE ACTIVE IN
YOU1000000171_S0000052	CURRENTLY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY COUNTRIES AND ANOTHER
YOU1000000171_S0000054	FIFTEEN TO TWENTY ARE SORT OF LOOKING AND VOTING
YOU1000000171_S0000056	BASED ON THE REST OF THE WORK ON IT AND WE MEET THREE TIMES A YEAR NEXT WEEK IILL BE IN COLONE GERMANY
YOU1000000171_S0000057	SPENDING A WEEK DOING STANDARDIZATION THEN WE WILL VOTE OUT THE COMMITTEE DRAFT O CPLUS PLUS TWENTY
YOU1000000171_S0000059	WHICH GOES TO THE NATIONAL STANDARDS COMMITTEES FOR COMMENTS AND REQUESTS FOR CHANGES AD
YOU1000000171_S0000060	IMPROVEMENTS THEN WE DO THAT AND THERE'S A SECOND SET OF VOTES WHERE HOPEFULLY EVERYBODY VOTES IN FAVOUR THIS HAS HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES
YOU1000000171_S0000061	FIRST TIME WE FINISHED WE STARTED IN THE FIRST TECHNICAL MEETING WAS IN NINETEEN NINETY THE LAST WAS IN NINETY EIGHT
YOU1000000171_S0000062	WE VOTED IT OUT THAT WAS THE STANDARD THAT PEOPLE USED TILL ELEVEN OR A LITTLE BIT PAST ELEVEN UMAND IT WAS AN INTERNATIONAL STANDARD
YOU1000000171_S0000063	ALL THE COUNTRIES VOTED IN FAVOUR IT TOOK LONGER WITH ELEVEN AND I'LL MENTION WHY
YOU1000000171_S0000064	BUT ALL THE NATIONS VOTED IN FAVOR AND WE WORK ON THE BASIS OF CONSENSUS
YOU1000000171_S0000065	THAT IS WE DO NOT WANT SOMETHING THAT PASSES SIXTY FORTY BECAUSE THEN WE'RE GETTING GETTING A DIALECTS AND OPPONENTS AND PEOPLE COMPLAIN TOO MUCH
YOU1000000171_S0000066	THEY ALL COMPLAIN TOO MUCH BUT BASICLLY IT HAS NO REAL EFFECT TE THE STANDARDS HAS BEEN OBEYED
YOU1000000171_S0000067	HEY HAVE BEEN WORKING TO MAKE IT EASIER TO USE MANY COMPILERS MANY COMPUTERS AND ALL OF THAT KIND OF STUFF
YOU1000000171_S0000069	AND SO THE FIRST THE TIT WAS TRADITIONAL WITH ISO STANDARDS TO TAKE TEN YEARS WE DID THE FIRST ONE AND EIGHT BRILLIANT
YOU1000000171_S0000071	AND WE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO DO THE NEXT ONE IT SIX BECAUSE NOW WE 'RE GOOD AT IT
YOU1000000171_S0000072	
YOU1000000171_S0000073	IT TOOK
YOU1000000171_S0000075	THIRTEEN
YOU1000000171_S0000076	YEAH IT WAS NAMED O X

YOU1000000175_S0000037	TAT IT'S ADDICTIVE THAT IT'S REALLY BAD FOR YOU ARE ALL TIED TO RACISM AND THE FACT THAT IT WAS CHINESE PEOPLE OWNING CHINESE RESTAURANTS THAT WERE USING IT AND THAT'S HOW IT GOT LABELLED AS SOMETHING THAT WAS DIRTY AND TOXIC
YOU1000000175_S0000038	IN MODERATION IT'S NO WORSE FOR YOU THAN REGULAR SALT
YOU1000000175_S0000040	PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ME IF GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOOD IS SAFE ORTHER IY SHOULD PAY MORE FOR NONGMMO FOOD PAY MORE FOR ORGANIC FOOD BUT GMO FOOD IS SAFE
YOU1000000175_S0000041	AND THE DEFINITION OF ORGANIC HONESTLY CAN BE SO BROAD AND VAGUE AND DIFFERENT FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER THAT MOST DOCTORS WILL SAY
YOU1000000175_S0000042	JUST EAT A HEALTHY BALANCED VARIED DIET AND YOU DON'T NECESSARLY NEED TO PAY MORE FOR ORGANIC FOR MOST FOODS
YOU1000000175_S0000044	I DO GET ASKED ABOUT ARTIFICIAL SWEETNESS A LOT BECAUSE A LOT OF MY FRIENDS LIKE TO CHUGG DIET SODAS THE THING TO BEAR IN MIND HERE IS THAT SOME OF THE STUDIES ARE NOT THAT ROBUST
YOU1000000175_S0000045	SO YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN HEADLINES SAYING DIET SODAS CAUSE AZHEIMER'S DISEASE OR DIET SODA CAUSES STROKE
YOU1000000175_S0000046	AND THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY TRUE AND THE THING THAT I WORRY ABOUT THEN IS WILL PEOPLE DITCH THE DIET SODA AND JUST START DRINKING SUGARY SODA WHEN WE KNOW THAT THOSE ARE LINKED TO DIABETES AND OTHER ILLNESSES
YOU1000000175_S0000047	ARTIFICIAL SWEETNESS THE KIND THAT YOU FIND IN DIET SODAS DO NOT CAUSE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
YOU1000000175_S0000049	STROKE AND CANCER YOU MAY HAVE SEEN HEADLINES THAT SAY THAT BUT I THINK THAT THEY ARE MISCONSTRUING WHAT THE SCIENTIFIC STUDIES ARE REALLY SHOWING
YOU1000000175_S0000050	THERE HAVE BEEN STUDIES SHOWING SOME HARMFUL EFFECTS OF ARTIFICIAL SWEETNESS IN RATS
YOU1000000175_S0000051	BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO TAKE THAT WITH A LARGE GRAIN OF SALT TO SAY THAT WELL JUST BECAUSE IT DID SOMETHING IN A RODANT'S BODY WILL THAT TRANSLATE INTO HAPPENING IN A HUMAN'S BODY
YOU1000000175_S0000052	BUT IF YOU WANT TO BE REALLY CAREFUL YOU CAN JUST DRINK WATER
YOU1000000175_S0000055	EGREAT MESSAGE
YOU1000000175_S0000057	YOU ARE A LITTLE BIT TALLER FIRST THING IN THE MORNING PROBABLY NO MORE THAN A CENTIMETR THOUGH AND THAT'S JUST BECAUSE GRAVITY COMPRESSES YOUR JOINTS DURING THE COURSE OF THE DAY
YOU1000000175_S0000058	IT'S ALSO WHY WHEN ASTRONAUTS COME BACK TO EARTH AFTER A SPACE MISSION THEY ARE A LITTLE BIT TALLER THAN WHEN THEY LEFT EARTH
YOU1000000175_S0000060	THERE ARE STUDIES SHOWING THAT BAD TEETH ESPECIALLY BAD GUMS CAN LEAD TO HEART DISEASE AND MAKE YOU MORE SUCEPTIBLE AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE BACTERIA
YOU1000000175_S0000061	THAT CAUSES GUM DISEASE CAN CIRCULATE THROUGH THE BLOOD AND CAUSE ILLNESS ELSEWHERE IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT MAKES US LOOK AT THE PATIENT HOLISTICALLY
YOU1000000175_S0000062	O IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE CHECKED AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO EAT WELL BUT IT'S ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT TO GET GOOD DENTAL HYGIENE AND GET ROUTINE CHECKUPS TO MAKE SURE YOUR GUMS ARE AS HEALTHY AS EVERYTHING ELSE
YOU1000000175_S0000064	THERE ARE SOME STUDIES THAT ARE QUITE EXCITING THAT SHOW THAT ASPERIN WHICH WE ALREADY RECOMMEND FOR A NUMBER OF THINGS MIGHT LOWER THE RISK OF CANCER
YOU1000000175_S0000065	BUT THERE'S STILL MORE RESEARCH BEING DONE AND THERE AREN'T A TON OF MEDICAL ORGANISATIONS SAYING HEY EVERYONE SHOULD TAKE AN ASPERIN PILL EVERY DAY TO PREVENT CANCE
YOU1000000175_S0000066	HAT WE'RE LEARNING IS THAT IT'S CERTAIN TYPES OF CANCER IN PARTICULAR AND THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING ABOUT ASPIRIN THAT PREVENTS METOSTATIC CANCER THAT PREVENTS CANCER CELLS FROM MOVING AROUND THE BODY
YOU1000000175_S0000067	BUT EVEN IN THAT CASE IT MIGHT BE THAT THE ASPERIN WORKS FOR THAT ONLY IN SOME PEOPLE AND NOT IN EVERYONE
YOU1000000175_S0000068	I GET SO MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT ASPIRIN BECAUSE IT FEELS LIKE EVERY YEAR WE DISCOVER A NEW USE FOR IT IT IS AN INCREDIBLE INCREDIBLE DRUG
YOU1000000175_S0000069	BUT THE JURY STILL OUT ON ASPERIN PREVENTING CANCER
YOU1000000175_S0000071	PLEASE DO NOT STOP TAKING AN ANTIBIOTIC THE MOMENT YOU FEEL BETTER IF YOU STILL HAVE MORE TO COMPLETE THE COURSE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT IF YOU HAVE TEN DAYS OF PILLS
YOU1000000175_S0000072	BUT YOU FEEL BETTER ON DAY FOUR OR DAY THREE EVEN YOU STILL HAVE TO FINISH THAT COURSE OF ANTIBIOTICS SO THAT THE BUG DOES NOT BECOME RESISTANT TO THE MEDICINE
YOU1000000175_S0000074	ANTIBIOTICS CANNOT HELP WITH A COLD MOST COLDS MOST SORE THROATS ARE CAUSED BY VIRUSES AND ANTIBIOTICS WILL NOT DO ANYTHING TO THOSE
YOU1000000175_S0000075	ANTIBIOTICS FIGHT BACTERIA VERY SPECIFICALLY SO IF YOU HAVE A VIRUS CIRCULATING IN YOUR BLOOD TAKING AN ANTIBIOTIC WILL NOT HELP
YOU1000000175_S0000077	IT'S BEEN CIRCULATING FOR AGES THAT YOU SHOULD STARVE A FEVER AND FEED A COLD YOU JUST NEED TO EAT WELL AND STAY HYDRATED WHEN YOU'RE NOT WELL
YOU1000000175_S0000078	IS DANGEROUS TO STARVE YOURSELF LIKE THAT'S A THING THAT WE KNOW THAT'S PROVEN SO IF YOU HAVE A FEVER STAY HYDRATED AND EAT WELL
YOU1000000175_S0000080	HE FLUSHOT CAN DEFINITELY NOT CAUSE THE FLU THE FLU SHOT MIGHT MAKE YOU AKY BUT FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF US GETTING THE FLU SHOT IS A FANTASTIC IDEA
YOU1000000175_S0000081	YOU WILL NOT GET THE FLU FROM IT AND IT WILL KEEP YOU SAFE
YOU1000000175_S0000083	I THINK WE ALL GREW UP HEARING THAT YOU SHOULD NEVER GO OUTSIDE IN THE COLD WHEN YOUR HAIR IS WET OR LIKE MAKE SURE YOU BUNDLE UP AND OUR MOTHERS LOVE DOING THAT TO US
YOU1000000175_S0000084	DURING COLD TIMES IS WHEN THERE ARE MORE COLD BUGS CIRCULATING ANYWAY AND ALSO THERE IS SOME RESEARCH THAT SHOWS THAT COLD WEATHER MIGHT IMPACT THE IMMUNE SYSTEM
YOU1000000175_S0000085	I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THAT ROBUST I THINK IT'S STILL A GOOD IDEA THOUGH TO WRAP UP VERY WORM
YOU1000000175_S0000087	YOU DO NOT LOSE MORE HEAT FROM YOUR HEAD THAN ANYWHERE ELSE ON YOUR BODY
YOU1000000175_S0000089	YOU CAN TELL A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT'S MAKING SOMEBODY SICK FROM LOOKING AT THE COLOR OF THEIR SFETON WHICH IS THE DISGUSTING THING THAT YOU CUGH UP
YOU1000000175_S0000090	FOR EXAMPLE IF IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT'S LESS LIKELY TO BE AN INFECTION USUALLY IF IT'S GREEN OR YELLOW MORE LIKELY TO BE A BACTERIAL OR VIRAL INFECTION
YOU1000000175_S0000091	I THINK DOCTORS ARE GOOD AT ASSESSING THE COLOR OF SPUTAN WHEN PEOPLE ARE COUGHING UP OUT OF THEIR LUNGS IF YOU ARE EMPTYING YOUR NOSE INTO A TISSUE
YOU1000000175_S0000092	PROBABLY LOOKING AT THE COLOUR TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT BACTERIA IS CAUSING IT THAT'S NOT GOINNAO BE SOMETHING YOU CAN ASSESS
YOU1000000175_S0000094	PEOPLE WONDER IF THEIR EARS STOP GROWING WHEN THE REST OF THEM STOPS GROWING AND ACTUALLY YOUR EARS CARRY ON GROWING FOREVER
YOU1000000175_S0000096	THE CURRENT GUIDELINES IN THE U S ARE THAT MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN CAN ONLY DONATE BLOOD IF THEY'VE BEEN CELIBATE FOR TWELVE MONTHS WHICH IS LUDICROUS AND STUPID AND UNSCIENTIFIC
YOU1000000175_S0000097	IT WASN'T UNTIL TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN THIRTY YEARS AFTER WE HAD A TEST FOR H IV AIDS
YOU1000000175_S0000098	THAT GAY MEN AND BISEXUAL MEN WERE TOLD YES YOU CAN DONATE BLOOD BUT THERE WAS A MAJOR CAVEAT
YOU1000000175_S0000099	AND THAT CAVEAT WAS THAT MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN COULD ONLY DONATE BLOOD IF THEY HAD BEEN CELIBATE FOR TWELVE MONTHS
YOU1000000175_S0000101	VACCINES DO NOT CAUSE AUTISM I MAY GET THAT TATTOOED ON MY FACE AT SOME POINT IN TWENTY TWENTY I'M KIND OF BEING SARCASTIC HERE
YOU1000000175_S0000102	BUT IF A PATIENT WAS TO ASK ME THAT I WOULD TAKE THEIR CONCERNS REALLY SERIOUSLY AND NOT BE DISMISSIVE BECUSE I WANT TO KNOW WHY THEY THINK THAT AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I REASSURE THEM
YOU1000000175_S0000103	THAT VACCINES ARE SAFE AND WHAT THEY CAUSE IS A LONG LIFE AND GOOD HEALTH
YOU1000000175_S0000105	THE BEST WAY TO DISINFECT YOUR HANDS IS TO WASH THEM VERY WELL WITH WATER AND SOAP AND THEN TO RUB THEM CLEAN
YOU1000000175_S0000107	HAND SANITIZER'S GOOD IF YOU'RE IN A BIND BUT IT'S NOWHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS WASHING YOUR HANDS WITH SOAPE AND WATER I GET ASKED A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT ALCOHOL JO
YOU1000000175_S0000108	ANDSANITIZER AND LIKE DISINFECTANT WIPES AND THEY ARE REALLY USEFUL THEY DO DISINFECT SURFACES
YOU1000000175_S0000109	BUT NOTHING IS EQUIVALENT TO DISINFECTING YOUR HANDS AS WASHING THEM WITH SOAP AND WATER
YOU1000000175_S0000111	IT'S TRUE THAT MANY PATIENTS CARED FOR BY FEMALE DOCTOR HAVE BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES THER'VE BEEN A NUMBER OF STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT PATIENTS DO BETTER
YOU1000000175_S0000112	THEY LIVE LONGER THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO BE READMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL IF THEY ARE CARED FOR BY A DOCTOR WHO IS A WOMAN
YOU1000000175_S0000113	AND AT THE SAME TIME WOMEN DOCTORS FACE LOTS OF DISCRIMINATION AND GET PAID LESS THAN OUR MALE COUNTERPARTS
YOU1000000175_S0000115	IT'S HARD TO AVOID MISINFORMATION SOMETIMES THERE IS SO MUCH FALSE HEALTH NEWS CIRCULATING
YOU1000000175_S0000116	AND SOMETIMES YOU CAN JUST FEEL OVERWHELMED EVEN WITH THE CORRECT INFORMATION I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING TO DO IS TO TALK TO A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER THAT YOU FEEL LIKE YOU CAN TRUST
YOU1000000175_S0000117	WHO HAS AN OPEN MIND AND SOMEONE THAT GIVES YOU THE TIME AND SPACE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT'S REALLY CONCERNING YOU
YOU1000000176_S0000001	CELLS ARE THE SMALLEST LIVING UNITS OF AN ORGANISM
YOU1000000176_S0000003	ALL CELLS HAVE THREE THINGS IN COMMON NO MATTER WHAT TYPE OF CELL THEY ARE
YOU1000000176_S0000005	ALL CELLS HAVE A CELL MEMBRANE WHICH SEPARATES THE INSIDE OF THE CELL FROM ITS ENVIRONMENT
YOU1000000176_S0000007	PYTOPLASM WHICH IS A JELLYLIKE FLUID AND DNA WHICH IS THE CELL'S GENETIC MATERIAL
YOU1000000176_S0000009	THERE ARE TWO BROAD CATEGORIES OF CELLS
YOU1000000176_S0000011	THE FIRST CATEGORY IS UCARIOTIC CELLS THEY HAVE ORGANNELS WHICH INCLUDE THE NUCLEUS AND OTHER SPECIAL PARTS
YOU1000000176_S0000013	EUCARIOTIC CELLS ARE MORE ADVANCED COMPLEX CELLS SUCH AS THOSE FOUND IN PLANTS AND ANIMALS
YOU1000000176_S0000015	THE SECOND CATEGORY IS PRO CARIOTIC CELLS
YOU1000000176_S0000016	THEY DON'T HAVE A NUCLEUS OR MEMBRANE ENCLOSED ORGANALES
YOU1000000176_S0000017	THEY DO HAVE GENETIC MATERIAL BUT IT'S NOT CONTAINED WITHIN A NUCLEUS
YOU1000000176_S0000018	PROCARIOTIC CELLS ARE ALWAYS ONE SELT OR UNICELLULAR ORGANISMS SUCH AS BACTERIA
YOU1000000176_S0000020	SO WHAT ARE ORGANELLS
YOU1000000176_S0000021	ORGANEL MEANS LITTLE ORGAN
YOU1000000176_S0000023	ORGANNELLS ARE THE SPECIALIZED PARTS OF A CELL THAT HAVE UNIQUE JOBS TO PERFORM
YOU1000000176_S0000025	LET'S START WITH THE NUCLEUS THE CONTROL CENTERE OF THE CELL
YOU1000000176_S0000027	THE NUCLEUS CONTAINS DNA OR GENETIC MATERIAL
YOU1000000176_S0000028	DNA DICTATES WHAT THE CELL IS GOING TO DO AND HOW IT'S GOING TO DO IT
YOU1000000176_S0000029	CHROMATIN IS THE TANGLED SPREAD OUT FORM OF DNA FOUND INSIDE THE NUCLEAR MEMBRANE
YOU1000000176_S0000031	WHEN A CELL IS READY TO DIVIDE DNA CONDENSES INTO STRUCTURES KNOWN AS CHROMOSOMES
YOU1000000176_S0000033	THE NUCLEUS ALSO CONTAINS A NUCLEOLIS
YOU1000000176_S0000035	WHICH IS A STRUCTURE WHERE RIBOZOMES ARE MADE
YOU1000000176_S0000037	AFTER RIBOZOMES LEAVE THE NUCLEUS THEY WILL HAVE THE IMPORTANT JOB OF SYNTHESIZING OR MAKING PROTEINS
YOU1000000176_S0000039	OUTSIDE THE NUCLEUS THE RYBOZOMES AND THE REST OF THE ORGANELS FLOAT AROUND IN CYTOPLASM WHICH IS THE JELLY LIKE SUBSTANCE
YOU1000000176_S0000041	RIBOZOMES MAY WANDER FREELY WITHIN THE CYTOPLASM
YOU1000000176_S0000043	OR ATTACH TO THE ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM SOMETIMES ABBREVIATED AS E R
YOU1000000176_S0000044	THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF ROUGH HAS RIBOZOMES ATTACHED TO IT
YOU1000000176_S0000045	AND SMOOTH DOESN'T HAVE RIPOZOMES ATTACHED TO IT
YOU1000000176_S0000047	THE ENDOPLASMIC ATICULUM IS A MEMBRANE ENCLOSED PASSAGEWAY FOR TRANSPORTING MATERIALS SUCH AS THE PROTEIN SYNTHESIZED BY RIBOZOMES
YOU1000000176_S0000049	PROTEINS AND OTHER MATERIALS EMERGE FROM THE ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM IN SMALL VESSICLES
YOU1000000176_S0000051	WHERE THE GOLJI APPARATUS SOMETIMES CALLED THE GOLJI BODY RECEIVES THEM
YOU1000000176_S0000053	AS PROTEINS MOVE THROUGH THE GOLGI BODY THEY'RE CUSTOMIZED INTO FORMS THAT THE CELL CAN USE
YOU1000000176_S0000055	THE GORLGI BODY DOES THIS BY FOLDING THE PROTEINS INTO USABLE SHAPES
YOU1000000176_S0000056	OR ADDING OTHER MATERIALS ONTO THEM SUCH AS LIPIDS
YOU1000000176_S0000058	OR CARBOHYDRATES
YOU1000000176_S0000060	VACUOLES ARE SACK LIKE STRUCTURES THAT STORE DIFFERENT MATERIALS
YOU1000000176_S0000061	HERE IN THIS PLANT CELL THE CENTRAL VACUOL STORES WATER
YOU1000000176_S0000063	GOING BACK TO THE ANIMAL CELL YOU WILL SEE AN ORGANEL CALLED A LYSOSOME
YOU1000000176_S0000064	LISOSOMES ARE THE GARBAGE COLLECTORS THAT TAKE IN DAMAGED OR WORN OUT CELL PARTS
YOU1000000176_S0000065	THEY ARE FILLED WITH ENZYMES THAT BREAK DOWN THIS CELLULAR DEBRIS
YOU1000000176_S0000067	THE MITOCHONDRIAN IS AN ORGANELE THAT IS THE POWERHOUSE FOR BOTH ANIMAL AND PLANT CELLS
YOU1000000176_S0000069	DURING A PROCESS CALLED CELLULAR RESPIRATION THE MITOCHONDRIA MAKE ATP MOLECULES THAT PROVIDE THE ENERGY FOR ALL OF THE CELL'S ACTIVITIES
YOU1000000176_S0000071	CELLS THAT NEED MORE ENERGY HAVE MORE MITOCHONDRIA
YOU1000000176_S0000073	MEANWHILE THE CELL MAINTAINS ITS SHAPE THROUGH A CYTOSKELETON
YOU1000000176_S0000075	THE CYITA SKELETON INCLUDES THE THREAD LIKE MICROFILLAMENTS WHICH ARE MADE OF PROTEIN
YOU1000000176_S0000077	AND MICROTUBULES WHICH ARE THIN HOLLOW TUBES
YOU1000000176_S0000079	SOME ORGANISMS SUCH AS PLANTS THAT ARE PHOTO AUTOTROPHIC
YOU1000000176_S0000081	MEANING THEY CAPTURE SUNLIGHT FOR ENERGY
YOU1000000176_S0000083	HAVE CELLS WITH AN ORGANEL CALLED A CHLOROPLAST
YOU1000000176_S0000085	E CHLOROPLASTE IS WHERE PHOTOSYNTHESIS HAPPENS
YOU1000000176_S0000087	IT'S GREEN BECAUSE IT HAS A GREEN PIGMENT CALLED CHLOROPHIL
YOU1000000176_S0000089	PLANT CELLS ALSO HAVE A CELL WALL OUTSIDE OF THEIR CELL MEMBRANES THAT SHAPE SUPPORT AND PROTECT THE PLANT CELL
YOU1000000176_S0000091	ANIMAL CELLS NEVER HAVE A CELL WALL
YOU1000000176_S0000093	THERE ARE MANY OTHER UNIQUE STRUCTURES THAT ONLY SOME CELLS HAVE
YOU1000000176_S0000095	HERE ARE JUST A FEW IN HUMANS FOR EXAMPLE THE RESPIRATORY TRACT IS LIGNED WITH CELLS THAT HAVE SILIA
YOU1000000176_S0000096	THESE ARE MICROSCOPIC HAIRLIKE PROJECTIONS THAT CAN MOVE IN WAVES
YOU1000000176_S0000097	THIS FEATURE HELPS TRAP INHALED PARTICLES IN THE AIR AND EXPELS THEM WHEN YOU COUGH
YOU1000000176_S0000099	ANOTHER UNIQUE FEATURE IN SOME CELLS IS FLAGELLA SOME BACTERIA HAVE FLAGELLA
YOU1000000176_S0000100	A FLAGYLUM IS LIKE A LITTLE TAIL THAT CAN HELP A CELL MOVE OR PROPELE ITSELF
YOU1000000176_S0000102	THE ONLY HUMAN CELL THAT HAS A FLAGELLUM IS A SPERM CELL
YOU1000000176_S0000104	IN SUMMARY REMEMBER
YOU1000000176_S0000105	EUCARIOTIC CELLS ARE PLANT AND ANIMAL CELLS WITH A NUCLEUS AND MEMBRANE ENCLOSED ORGANELS
YOU1000000176_S0000107	WHILE PROCARIOTIC CELLS ARE UNICELLULAR ORGANISMS WITHOUT THESE THINGS
YOU1000000176_S0000109	ALL CELLS HAVE A CELL MEMBRANE CYTOPLASM AND GENETIC MATERIAL
YOU1000000176_S0000111	AND EVEN THOUGH ONLY PLANT CELLS HAVE CHLOROPLASTS BOTH PLANT AND ANIMAL CELLS HAVE MITOCHONDRIA
YOU1000000177_S0000000	COFFEE DID YOU KNOW THAT OVER FOUR HUNDRED BILLION CUPS OF COFFEE ARE CONSUMED EVERY YEAR
YOU1000000177_S0000001	COFFEE ALSO KNOWN AROUND MY HOUSE AS LIQUID GOLD IS THE SECOND MOST TRADED COMMODITY IN THE WORLD ONLY BEHIND OIL IN TODAY'S VIDEO I'M GOIN TO SHOW YOU WHY COFFEE IS NOT BAD FOR YOU
YOU1000000177_S0000002	AND THE NINE SCIENTIFIC BENEFITS TO HAVING A DAILY CUP OF JO
YOU1000000177_S0000003	I WILL ALSO FINISH WITH SOME SHORT FA CUES ABOUT THE BEST TIMES TO DRINK COFFEE HOW MUCH PER DAY IS OKAY AND HOW MUCH IS TOO MUCH
YOU1000000177_S0000004	WHEN PEOPLE SAY COFFEE IS BAD FOR YOU THEY OFTEN POINT TO A FEW THINGS INSOMNIA DEHYDRATION AND ADRENAL FATIGUE
YOU1000000177_S0000005	INSOMNIA IS USUALLY JUST A RESULT OF DRINKING COFFEE TOO EARLY SINCE EFFECTS CAN LAST UP TO TEN HOURS AFTER DRINKING SIMPLY STOP DRINKING COFFEE BEFORE NOON AND YOU SHOULD BE FINE
YOU1000000177_S0000006	DEHYDRATION YES COFFEE IS A NATURAL DIARETIC BUT THIS PROBLEM IS CURED BY DRINKING MORE WATER WHICH YOU SHOULD BE DOING ANYWAY
YOU1000000177_S0000007	AND ADRENAL FATIGUE THIS IS NOT EVEN A REAL MEDICAL CONDITION ANYONE SPOUTING THIS SORT OF NONSENSE DOESN'T DESERVE YOUR TIME OR ATTENTION
YOU1000000177_S0000008	HERE ARE THE PROVEN BENEFITS OF DRINKING COFFEE BACKED BY SCIENTIFIC STUDIES NUMBER ONE COFFEE CAN HELP YOU BURN FAT
YOU1000000177_S0000009	CAFINE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BOOST METABOLISM BY UP TO ELEVEN PERCENT AND DRAMATICALLY INCREASE FAT BURNING POTENTIAL
YOU1000000177_S0000010	OTHER STUDIES HAVE EVEN SHOWN THAT THE RATE OF FAT BEING BURNED WHILE DRINKING CAFFENE CAN IMPROVE BY TEN PERCENT IN OBESE INDIVIDUALS AND TWENTY NINE PERCENT IN LEAN INDIVIDUALS
YOU1000000177_S0000011	NUMBER TWO COFFEE HELPS YOU EXERCISE BETTER CAFFENE HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE SUPPLEMENTS EVER FOR IMPROVING EXERCISE OUTPUT
YOU1000000177_S0000012	DRINKING COFFEE CAUSES A SPIKE IN ADRENALIN AND CAUSES AN INCREASE IN EXERCISE PERFORMANCE BY AROUND ELEVEN TO TWELVE PERCENT NUMBER THREE YOUR HEART SEEMS TO LIKE IT
YOU1000000177_S0000013	DRINKING UP TO TWO COFFEE CUPS PER DAY CAN REDUCE THE RISK OF HEART FAILURE BY UP TO ELEVEN PERCENT NUMBER FOUR COFFEE CAN MAKE YOU SMARTER
YOU1000000177_S0000014	IT ENHANCES THE FIRING OF NEURONS IN THE BRAIN AND HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE VARIOUS BRAIN FUNCTIONS INCLUDING MOOD ENERGY LEVELS REACTION TIME MEMORY AND GENERAL COGNITIVE FUNCTION
YOU1000000177_S0000015	NUMBER FIVE COFFEE CONTAINS AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF ANTIOXIDANTS THESE ANTIOXIDENTS HELP FIGHT FREE RADICALS IN THE BODY
YOU1000000177_S0000016	AND SCIENTISTS HAVE IDENTIFIED APPROXIMATELY A THOUSAND DIFFERENT ANTIOXIDANTS IN THE COFFEE BEAN ALONE NUMBER SIX COFFEE DRINKERS HAVE A LOWER RISK OF DEVELOPING CANCER
YOU1000000177_S0000017	ASTONISHINGLY COFFEE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO LOWER THE CHANCES OF GETTING LIVER CANCER BY UP TO FORTY PERCENT
YOU1000000177_S0000018	ALSO A STUDY WITH OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS SHOWED THAT PEOPLE WHO CONSUMED COFFEE HAD A LOWER RISK OF RECTAL CANCER BY FIFTEEN PERCENT
YOU1000000177_S0000019	NUMBER SEVEN COFFEE CONTAINS ESSENTIAL NUTRIENTS THE BODY LOVES AND NEEDS ONE CUP OF COFFEE CONTAINS NUTRIENTS LIKE RIBOFLAVIN POTASSIUM MAGNESIUM AND OTHERS
YOU1000000177_S0000020	IL THE VOLUME OF THE NUTRIENTS IT CONTAINS IS NOT GOING TO BLOW YOU AWAY
YOU1000000177_S0000021	IF YOU DRINK THREE CUPS PER DAY LIKE THE AVERAGE AMERICAN ADULT YOU'LL BE GETTING A STEADY SOURCE OF VITAL NUTRIENTS THAT YOUR BODY LOVES
YOU1000000177_S0000022	NUMBER EIGHT COFFEE CAN FIGHT DEPRESSION MOST PEOPLE ARE UNAWARE OF THE FACT THAT OVER SEVENTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE JUST IN AMERICA ALONE SUFFER FROM SOME FORM OF DEPRESSION
YOU1000000177_S0000023	AND IT'S GROWING EVERY YEAR DRINKING COFFEE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO LOWER THE RISK OF DEVELOPING DEPRESSION BY UP TO TWENTY PERCENT FOR WOMEN
YOU1000000177_S0000024	IT HAS ALSO BEEN SHOWN THAT THOSE WHO DRINK UP TO FOUR CUPS PER DAY ARE FIFTY THREE PERCENT LESS LIKELY TO COMMIT SUICIDE THAN THOSE WHO DO NOT
YOU1000000177_S0000025	NUMBER NINE COFFEE DRINKERS HAVE A LOWER RISK OF DEVELOPING CERTAIN DISEASES TYPE TWO DIABETES NOW AFFECTS OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE AND IS BECOMING A GLOBAL PROBLEM
YOU1000000177_S0000026	HEAVY COFFEE DRINKERS HOWEVER HAVE A TWENTY THREE PERCENT TO SIXTY SEVEN PERCENT REDUCTION IN RISK OF DEVELOPING THE DISEASE
YOU1000000177_S0000027	ALSO DRINKING COFFEE RESULTS IN A THIRTY TWO PERCENT TO SIXTY PERCENT REDUCTION IN RISK FOR DEVELOPING PARKINSONS AS WELL
YOU1000000177_S0000028	THESE OVERALL STUDIES SHOW THAT COFFEE IS GOOD FOR YOUR HEART BRAIN AND YOUR BODY THE BEST TIME OF DAY TO DRINK COFFEE IS AROUND ONE HOUR AFTER WAKING UP OR THIRTY MINUTES BEFORE YOUR WORKOUT
YOU1000000177_S0000029	USE A DRIP COFFE MAKER IF POSSIBLE OTHER POPULAR MACHINES USE PLASTIC CUPS THAT ARE UNRECYCLABLE AND ARE VERY DAMAGING TO OUR PLANET
YOU1000000177_S0000030	W MUCH PER DAY IS OKAY A SHORT RULE OF THUMB IS TWO CUPS A DAY IS FINE THREE CUPS A DAY IS GOOD AND FOUR CUPS A DAY SHOULD BE THE ABSOLUTE MAX
YOU1000000177_S0000031	FINALLY DRINK YOUR COFFEE BLACK MOST OF THE SPECIALTY DRINKS AT COFFEE SHOPS ARE CALORIE NIGHTMARES AND ARE BASICALLY GLORIFIED MILK SHAKES
YOU1000000177_S0000032	DRINKING IT BLACK TAKES SOME TIME TO GET USED TO BUT JUST LIKE AN ACQUIRED TASTE TO WINE IT GETS BETTER WITH TIME

YOU1000000178_S0000088	
YOU1000000179_S0000001	WE'RE GOING TO EXPLORE THE CONCEPT OF CHARITABLE GIVING TO SEE THE WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN HELP MAKE AN IMPACT WHILE ALSO TAKING ADVANTAGE OF SOME OF THE FINANCIAL AND TAX BENEFITS
YOU1000000179_S0000003	CHARITABLE GIVING DOESN'T HAVE TO BE COMPLICATED
YOU1000000179_S0000004	IT CAN BE AS SIMPLE AS MAKING DONATIONS TO YOUR CHURCH ALMA MATER OR VOLUNTEERING YOUR TIME LIKE HELPING OUT AT THE LOCAL MISSION
YOU1000000179_S0000005	GIVING IS MOST FULFILLING WHEN YOU DONATE YOUR MONEY OR TIME TO A CAUSE YOU'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT
YOU1000000179_S0000006	AND STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT WHEN WE GIVE IT TRIGGERS THE SAME CHEMICAL REACTIONS IN OUR BRAINS AS FALLING IN LOVE OR BONDING WITH A NEW BORN CHILD
YOU1000000179_S0000007	BESIDES THE OBVIOUS EMOTIONAL BENEFITS YOU COULD ALSO END UP SAVING ON TAXES BY GIVING
YOU1000000179_S0000009	NOW THAT YOU HAVE YOUR MISSION IT'S TIME TO THINK ABOUT WHAT GOALS YOU WANT TO ACCOMPLISH

YOU1000000179_S0000012	SOME THINGS YOU CAN INCLUDE IN YOUR PLAN TO HELP YOUR GIVING HAVE MORE OF AN IMPACT WOULD BE TO VOLUNTEER NOT JUST MONEY BUT SKILLS YOU MAY HAVE
YOU1000000179_S0000013	IT CAN ALSO HELP TO COMMIT TO A CONSISTENT DONATION OVER TIME AND TO FOCUS ON THE LESS GLAMOROUS BUT ESSENTIAL NEEDS THE CHARITY MAY HAVE
YOU1000000179_S0000015	THERE ARE OVER ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION NONPROFITS IN THE UNITED STATES SO YOU'LL HAVE A LOT OF CHOICES
YOU1000000179_S0000016	MAKE SURE TO EVALUATE THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT SHARE YOUR CAUSE TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE STRONG LEADERSHIP PROCEDURES THAT WILL GUIDE THEIR OPERATIONS AND WILL BENEFIT FROM YOUR ASSISTANCE
YOU1000000179_S0000018	GIVING CAN BE MORE FUN AND MORE EFFECTIVE BY CONNECTING WITH OTHERS WHO SHARE YOUR GOALS
YOU1000000179_S0000019	GETTING FAMILY AND FRIENDS INVOLVED HELPS TO ALSO REINFORCE SHARED VALUES AND CREATE STRONGER CONNECTIONS
YOU1000000179_S0000020	BESIDES BENEFITING THE ORGANIZATIONS OF YOUR CHOICE YOUR CHARITABLE GIVING CAN ALSO IMPACT YOUR FINANCES

YOU1000000180_S0000003	THERE WAS A NECESSITY FOR THE GOVERNMENT AT THE TIME TO SHOW THAT IT WAS SERIOUS ABOUT DEALING WITH POLLUTION PROBLEMS
YOU1000000180_S0000004	THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS WILLING TO STEP IN WHERE OBVIOUSLY THE ALMOST TOTAL DELEGATION O THE STATES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UP PRIOR TO NINETEEN SEVENTY HADN'T GOTTEN THE JOB DONE

YOU1000000180_S0000017	BUT ALSO A TREATY THAT I THINK ESTABLISHED A FRAMEWORK FOR DEALING WITH INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS
YOU1000000180_S0000019	THE CLEAN AIR ACT OBVIOUSLY HAS TO STAND VERY HIGH ON THE LIST OF THINGS THAT I THINK WE WILL BE PROUD OF AND WI'LL STAND THE TEST OF TIME IT WAS A TIME WHEN WE
YOU1000000180_S0000021	DEALT WITH VERY HIGH EXPECTATIONS WHEN WE CRAFTED A LAW A LOT OF THE IDEAS HAD BEEN IN THE AGENCY WERE CONCEPTUALLY DEVELOPED IN THE AGENCY THAT WERE SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED WITH THE VIEWS OF OTHER AGENCIES AND COORDINATED VERY CLOSELY WITH THE WHITE HOUSE
YOU1000000180_S0000023	O BETTER THAN YOUR GOVERNMENT TO PROTECT YOUR AIR YOUR WATER AND YOUR LAND IT IS SOMETHING THAT EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD EXPECT OF ITS GOVERNMENT THAT WE WOULD DO THESE THINGS
YOU1000000180_S0000024	OR YOU SETTING TOUGH STANDARDS SETTING STANDARDS THAT PROTECT THE PEOPLE MOST AT RISK AND THEN ALLOWING FOR FLEXIBILITY IN HOW THOSE STANDARDS ARE MET WHICH WILL ALLOW US TO BUILD ON THE INNOVATION AND THE CREATIVITY THAT EXISTS IN THIS COUNTRY

YOU1000000183_S0000003	THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD DO YOU NOT NOT A SELCT TH ONE FROM OVERPRICED TO FAIRLY PLICE SO EN THET WAS FAIRLY PLICED AT THE START OF THIS EXERCISE AND THEN HAD A VERY YOU KNOW FIVE FOR FOUR SALE
YOU1000000183_S0000005	HEY GUYS WELCOME BACK TO THE CHANNEL IN THIS VIDEO WE ARE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT SOME INVESTING LESSONS THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM PETER LYNCH
YOU1000000183_S0000006	THAT WE CAN APPLY FOR OUR OWN INVESTING IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY ONE
YOU1000000183_S0000007	SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOOK AT AN INTERVIEW FROM WAY BACK NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN A CHARLIE ROSE INTERVIEW THAT PETER LYNCH DID AND I DO HAVE TO SAY APOLOGIES
YOU1000000183_S0000008	SOME OF THE CUTS IN THIS INTERVIEW ARE GOING TO BE QUITE ABRUPT IT'S BECAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND LIKE CHARLIE ROSE HE JUST INTERRUPTS PETER ALL THE TIME IN THIS INTERVIEW
YOU1000000183_S0000009	SO I APOLOGIZE I'VE TRIED TO DO THE BEST I CAN TO GET TO THE MEAT OF THE ARGUMENT BECAUSE I THINK THE WHOLE INTERVIEW IS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MINUTES SO I'VE TRIED TO CHOP IT DOWN INTO THE BEST BITS
YOU1000000183_S0000010	SO WITH THAT SAID LET'S GET STUCK INTO IT
YOU1000000183_S0000011	GLAD TO BE
YOU1000000183_S0000012	EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT'S GOING ON
YOU1000000183_S0000013	WELL WE HAD A HUGE RUN I MEAN TE MARKET WAS FOUR THOUSAND JUST YOU KNOW TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO YEAH AND IT RAN UP TO EIGHTY THREE HUNDRED IN AUGUST
YOU1000000183_S0000014	AND YOU KNOW LIKE ANY BIG RALLY SOMETIMES IT BACKS OFF I MEAN IT'S HEALTHY
YOU1000000183_S0000015	EVERYTHING IS OVERPRICED
YOU1000000183_S0000016	YEAH AND THAT DOESN'T HELP ANYTHING THE MARKET SINCE WORLD WAR TWO HAS SOLD BETWEEN TEN TIMES EARNINGS AND TWENTY TIMES EUARNINGS IF YOU LOK AT THE DOW JONES OR THE SP FUND IF YOU ADD UP ALL THE COMPANIES AND TAKE THE EARNINGS
YOU1000000183_S0000017	SAY THERE'S A RELATIONSHIP AND IT FOLLOWS MCDONALD'S EANINGS HAVE BEEN TERRIFIC THE LAST THIRTY YEARS AND THE STOCK'S BEEN TERIFIC TERE'S A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP SO THE EARNINGS OF THE S N P FIVE HUNDRED HAVE BEEN BETWEEN THIS RANGE OF TEN AND TWENTY
YOU1000000183_S0000018	WE WERE JUST ABOUT TO GO OVER THE TWENTY WHICH IS THE HIGH END OF THE P RANGE THERE WASN'T A
YOU1000000183_S0000019	N PTWENTY IS TWO IS AT THE TOP OF HIGH HIGH IT SHOULD EVER BE
YOU1000000183_S0000020	RIGHT IT'S BEEN OVER THERE ONLY A FEW TIMES EVER OVER TWENTY AND THAT'S WHEN USUALLY INFLATION'S ABOUT ZERO
YOU1000000183_S0000021	SO THIS CLIP KIND OF JUST SETS THE SCENE BECAUSE WHAT PETER LYNCH IS DESCRIBING IN THIS CLIP IS ACTUALLY WHAT WE SEE TODAY HE'S TALKING ABOUT HOW THE P RATIO OF THE MARKET
YOU1000000183_S0000022	GENERALLY SITS BETWEEN TEN AND TWENTY WITH TWENTY REALLY BEING THAT UPPER END WELL NOW THESE DAYS WE HAVE DISCOVERED WHAT THE ULTRA UPPER END OF THAT NUMBER LOOKS LIKE
YOU1000000183_S0000023	IT SEEMS TO B
YOU1000000183_S0000025	BOUT THIRTY NOW THAT'S KIND OF SCARY BECAUSE WHAT WE CURRENTLY SEE IS A PEE RATIO FOR THE MARKET AT THIRTY FIVE
YOU1000000183_S0000026	IT'S ONLY BEEN OVER THIRTY IN THREE TIMES IN HISTORY NINETEEN TWENTY NINE NINETEEN NINETY NINE AND RIGHT NOW
YOU1000000183_S0000027	SO THERE'S NO QUESTION TAT THE MARKET IS CERTAINLY HOT JUST LIKE THE MARKET WAS HOT BACK WHEN PETER LYNCH DID THIS INTERVIEW
YOU1000000183_S0000028	BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN BUT THE QUESTION WE'VE GOT TO ASK OURSELVES IS WELL HOW DO WE GO ABOUT OUR INVESTING IN THIS ENVIRONMENT
YOU1000000183_S0000029	THE DECLINE YESTERDAY IN A SENSE HAD LET OFF SOME OF THIS OVERVALUATION THE MARKET WAS EVEN OVERVALUED AT WHERE IT WAS RGHT AND BY LETTING IT OFF RIGT THEN WE GOT BACK TO WHAT WAS REASONABLE
YOU1000000183_S0000030	YEAH I WOULD SAY FAIRLY PRICED MAYBE FOR THE LARGER COMPANIES THEY'RE NOW OKAY THERE MIGHT BE SOME SMALLER COMPANIES MEAN WE'VE HAD THREE THOUSAND COMPANIES COME PUBLIC THE LAST FOUR YEARS THAT'S TWO AF BUSINESS DAY
YOU1000000183_S0000031	SOME OF THOSE COMPANIES HAVE GONE DOWN DRAMATICALLY NAND THAT' SORT OF A RESEARCH ZONE THAT AVERAGE PEOPLE IN THE STOCK SHOP THAT'S WE CAN FIND SOME PEOPLE KNOW A LOT ABOUT THIS TEN THOUSAND PUBLIC COMPANIES
YOU1000000183_S0000032	A LO OF THM ARE VERY ATTRACKTIVE NO ONE'S FOLLOWING D THERE'S LOTS OF PEOPLE FOLON IBM
YOU1000000183_S0000034	COMPANIES THAT NOBODY ELSE FOLLOWED
YOU1000000183_S0000035	RIGHT I'D LIKE TO GO TO SEE COMPANES WITH UNIONS OR COMPANIES IN TROUBLE OR COMPANIES THAT NOONE LOOKS AT
YOU1000000183_S0000036	HAD NICE BEDS
YOU1000000183_S0000037	AHD YOU HAVE TO LOK A T
YOU1000000183_S0000038	OKAN WHOS YOUR WIFE WE THA THE STORY
YOU1000000183_S0000039	YOUE GOT PEER ONE IMPORTS MY WIFE FOND THAT ONE TOO BUT BUT YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT TWENTY TO FIND ONE IT'S JUST YOU GO TO THE MALL AND FIND THE STOCK I MEAN YOU HAVE TO SAY MY GOD THIS SOUNDS LIKE IT'S GOOD THEN YOU HAVE TO DO SOME STEPS YOU HAVE TO DO AN ORGANIZED METHOD
YOU1000000183_S0000040	NOW THAT METHOD WE'LL GET TO IN A SECOND BUT IN THIS CLIP PETER INADVERTENTLY DESCRIBES EXACTLY HOW WE SHOULD BE APPROACHING OUR INVESTING RIGHT NOW
YOU1000000183_S0000041	BECAUSE TODAY EVEN THOUGH THE MARKET IS REALLY HIGH WE'RE IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE ACTUALLY A LOT OF BUSINESSES ARE GOING DOWN
YOU1000000183_S0000042	WHAT WE SEE IS THAT AN INDEX LIKE THE SAND P FIVE HUNDRED IS ACTUALLY PROPPED UP
YOU1000000183_S0000043	BY LITERALLY FIVE TO TEN REALLY HIGH PERFORMING MASSIVE BAHEMUTH COMPANIES
YOU1000000183_S0000044	NOW WHAT PETER'S TELLING US IN THIS CLIP IS TO BE A GREAT INVESTOR EVEN WHEN THE MARKET'S REALLY OVERVALUED YOU HAVE TO GET AWAY FROM LOOKING AT JUST THOSE MASSIVE BAHEMTH COMPANIES
YOU1000000183_S0000045	EVERYBODY'S FOLLOWING THESE BIG COMPANIES EVERYONE'S INVESTING IN THEM AND THE PRICES FOR THESE BIG COMPANIES ARE ALL SKYHIGH
YOU1000000183_S0000046	SO WE SHOULD BE BROADENING OUR HORIZONS AND LOOKING MAYBE AT THE COMPANIES THAT COME AFTER THE FIFTIETH LARGEST STOCK IN THE S AND P FIVE HUNDRED
YOU1000000183_S0000047	RMAYBE BEYOND THE TWENTIETH LARGEST STOCK IN THE ASX TWO HUNDRED BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE MORE LIKELY GOING TO FIND VALUE
YOU1000000183_S0000048	AND THEN THE OTHER SECRET IS THAT OF COURSE YOU JUST HAVE TO KEEP LOOKING AT A LOT OF BUSINESSES
YOU1000000183_S0000049	THE BEST INVESTORS ARE THE ONES THAT TURN OVER THE MOST STONES RIGHT AS PETER LYNCH SAID IN THIS INTERVIEW YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT TWENTY TO FIND ONE
YOU1000000183_S0000050	GHTWITH THAT SAID NOW LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE ACTUAL STEPS THAT WE SHOULD ALL BE TAKING TO GO AHEAD AND MAKE AN INVESTMENT IN THIS SORT OF ENVIRONMENT
YOU1000000183_S0000051	THEN YOU HAVE TO DO SOME STEPS YOU HAVE TO DO AN ORGANIZED METHOD PEOPLE ARE CAREFUL WHEN THEY BUY A TOASTER
YOU1000000183_S0000053	CARE FOR THEY' CAREFUL N THEY BUY THEY DO THEY DO SOME RESEARCH
YOU1000000183_S0000054	BUT THEY DON'T DO IT WITH STOCK THEY CALL THE BROKER OR THEY SEE SOMEBODY AT LUNCHAND THEY SAIYD MAN I GOT THIS HOT STOCK AND YOU RUN RIGHT OUT AND YOU SPEND FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS YSMALL INVESTORS
YOU1000000183_S0000055	YEAH OR THEVEN WORSE THEY PUT AN OPTION IN INTERNATIONAL DATA WACK THEY DON'T EVEN OWN INTERNATIONAL DATA WACK THEYHAVE A NINETY DAY PA
YOU1000000183_S0000056	BIL SAID IT WAS GOOD AND THEY MAKE A LOT OF MONEY
YOU1000000183_S0000057	DT'AND IT'S LIKE A CASINO YEAH SO IT'S LIKE A CACASINO YOU GET THE SAME RESULTS AS IF THERE'S MORE PAPERWORK
YOU1000000183_S0000058	SO THIS MORNING YOU GET UP AND YOU GO IN AND YOU LOOK AT AT THOSE COMPANIES THAT FIT HAT
YOU1000000183_S0000059	THAT YOU KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN ITCH I MEANLET'S SAY T CAMENT INDUSTRY GOES FROM CRUMMY TO SEMI CRUMMY TO FAIRLY GOOD THE STOCKS ARE GOING NORTH
YOU1000000183_S0000060	YOU'RE GONNA MAKE MONEY THAT'S THE INDUSTRY YOU KNOW WHAT IF YOU KNOW THE PUBLISHING INDUSTRY YOU'RE YOU SOME PEOPLE HAVE SE YOU HAVE AN EDGE YOU WORK I MEAN WHAT IF YOU LAST THIRTY YEARS
YOU1000000183_S0000061	YOU WORK IN THE RESTAURANT S YOU WOULD AVE SEEN TACOBELL YOOULD AV SEEN SOMBARROS YOU OULD AVE SEEN PIZA HUT YOU WOUD AV SEEN CHILIS YOUD SEEN THESE COMPANIES DOING VERY WELL YOU SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT THOSE INSTEAD OF TRYING TO BUY BIOTECHNOLOGY SC U KNOW NOTHING ABOUT
YOU1000000183_S0000062	I MEAN I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT LOCAL AREA NETWORKING ALOT OF PEOPLE ARE BUYING THIS CISCO THEY'RE BUYING THE EQUIPMENT SAYING WE'RE GON TA ROOT TOGETHER ALL THESE PERIPHERLS ERE GONA PUT TOGETHER THE SERVER
YOU1000000183_S0000063	BUT BUT THIT'S NOT A BAD BUY BECAUSE THEY WN A HUGE PERCENTAGE OF THEIR MARKET
YOU1000000183_S0000064	T THAT WAS THEY'RE SAYING ONLY A FEW PEOPLE HAD THE E SA MY GOD IF IT WORKS FOR US OTHER PEOPLE TRY IT THEN COLLEGES WILL TRY IT HIGH SCHOOLS WILL TRY IT THEN W'LL GO OVERSEAS THEY KNEW THEY WERE EARLY IN THE BALL GAME RIGHT
YOU1000000183_S0000065	AND THEY SHOULD HAVE EEN BUYING THAT COMPANY INSTEAD OF OUT BUYING SOMETHING THY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT SOME OIL DRILLING COMPANY I MEAN PEOPLE HAVE THIS TENDENCY TO ALWAYS BUY SOMETHING THEY DON'T
YOU1000000183_S0000066	ALL YOU NEED IS A FE CHALLEY ALL YOU NEED IS A FEW GOOD STOCKS
YOU1000000183_S0000067	SIS YOUR SONG THIS AS BEEN YOUR SONG FOR A LONG TIME BONLY BY WHAT YOU KNOW
YOU1000000183_S0000068	O BUT PEOPLE AWAKEN UP I THE ORIN THE SAY THE'S FIVE THOUSAND COMPANIES OUT THERE WHICH ONE SHOULD I BUY THETHE AVERAGE PERSON OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW FOUR OR FIVE COMPANIES THEY OGT TO BE AL TO LECTURE ON HEM THEY UNDERSTAND THE COMPANIES
YOU1000000183_S0000069	AND THIS FORCES YOU THIS TOOL SAYS T YOU RIGHTE DOWN
YOU1000000183_S0000070	YOU KEEP SAYING THIS
YOU1000000183_S0000071	THAT MAKES SENSE YOU HAVE TO START WITH OBVIOUSLY GOING AHEAD AND DOING SOME RESEARCH YOU KNOW HE SAYS PEOPLE DO A LOT OF RESEARCH WHEN THEY GO TO BUY A TOASTE
YOU1000000183_S0000072	WHY ISN'T IT THAT PEOPLE DO A LOT OF RESEARCH WHEN THEY GO TO BUY A STOCK YOU KNOW DON'T TREAT THE STOCK MARKET LIKE A CASINO
YOU1000000183_S0000073	D THEN WHEN YOU ACTUALLY DO SIT DOWN TO LEARN ABOUT SOME COMPANIES LOOK AT THE COMPANIES THAT ARE REALLY RELEVANT TO YOU
YOU1000000183_S0000074	WARREN BUFFOTT WOULD USE THE PHRASE STICK WITHIN YOUR CIRCLE OF COMPETENCE PETER LYNCH'S EXAMPLE HERE IS YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE SOMEONE THAT WORKS IN THE RESTAURANT RESTAURANT INDUSTRY
YOU1000000183_S0000075	LOOK AT PIZZA HUT LOOK AT TACO BELL THEY'RE COMPANIES THAT YOU PROBABLY ALREADY UNDERSTAND TO QUITE A HIGH LEVEL
YOU1000000183_S0000076	AND DON'T GO MESSING AROUND WITH YOU KNOW THESE BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES THAT NOBODY UNDERSTANDS SO ONCE YOU FIND THOSE COMPANIES THAT RESONATE WITH YOU THEN YOU GO IN YOU DO THAT RESEARCH
YOU1000000183_S0000077	AS PETER LYNCH SAYS YOU ONLY NEED FOUR TO FIVE GOOD STOCKS IN LIKE A DECADE WAREN BUFFE WOULD ARGUE YOU NEED EVEN LESS THAN THAT
YOU1000000183_S0000078	BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW THOSE COMPANIES WELL ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO GIVE A LECTURE ON THEIR BUSINESS
YOU1000000183_S0000079	SO THAT'S REALLY THE FIRST STEP FIRST STEP IS TO STAY WITHIN YOUR KIND OF CIRCLE OF COMPETENCE SECOND STEP GO IN AND UNDERSTAND THOSE BUSINESSES IN DEPTH
YOU1000000183_S0000080	AND THEN AFTER THAT WHAT HAPPENS NEXT WELL LET'S LISTEN IN
YOU1000000183_S0000081	ONE THING YOU'RE TRYING TO DO ISA AT LL THESE PUBLIC COMPANIES OUT THERE HERE'S THE COMPANY I REALLY LIKE THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE TERRIFIC THEIR EARNINGS ARE DOING WELL THEIR COMPETITORS ARE DOING POORLY
YOU1000000183_S0000082	I THINK THIS COMPANY 'S DOING TERRIFIC AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE STOCK MIGHT HAVE GONE FROM FORTY TO THIRTY BECAUSE OF THIS DECLINE THAT WOULD SAY WOW HERE'S A CHANCE TO BUY IT
YOU1000000183_S0000083	YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY SOME COMPANIES MIGHT HAVE BEEN OVERPRICED AT SIXTY ND ALL THEY DID WAS GO TO FIFTY ANO SAY BIG DEAL SO YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND CMPANYS YOU LIKED ANYWAY
YOU1000000183_S0000084	RIGHT NOW YOU LIKE THEM AND NOW THEY'VE HAD A HAIRCUT THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD DO YOU NOT NOT A SELECTED ONE FRM OVERPRICED TO FAIRLY PLACE SOENTHING WAS FAIRLY PLACED AT THE START OF THIS EXERCISE
YOU1000000183_S0000085	AND THEN HAD A VERY YOU KNOW FIVE FOR FOUR SALE YOU KNOW
YOU1000000183_S0000086	IF YOU HAD BEEN MANAGING THE MAGELLAN FUND THIS MORNING YOU WOULD HAVEBEEN BUYING LIKE CRAZY
YOU1000000183_S0000087	I WOULD BEEN RESEARCHING LIKE CRAZY I WOULD BEEN SAYING WHICH COMPANIES ARE THE SAME STORY IS THERE ANYTHING REALLY HAPPENG THIS IS A NON EVENT FOR THEM THEY'RE STILL DOING WELL EVEN IF WE HAVE A RECESSION
YOU1000000183_S0000088	'S NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM AND THAT'S THE KIND OF KINS I WU TRYING TO BUY BUT LET'S SAY IF A COM JUST THINK OF THIS AS BEING YOU SAY TO YOURSELF I THINK THIS CMPEY'S GONNA EAN SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE
YOU1000000183_S0000089	IF IT'S ALREADY DISCOUNTING THAT IF IT'S SELLING AT A HUGE MULTIPLE YOU SAY IT'S ALREADY IT HAS TO WORK AND THEN IT'S ONL GOING TO STAY EVEN
YOU1000000183_S0000090	SO YOU HAVE TO SAYESUFF IF I'M RIGHT HOW MUCH M I GONG TO MAKE IF I'M WRONG HOW UCH AM I GOING TO LOSE THAT'S THE RISK REWARD RATIO AND STOCK SHOP WE TALK ABOUT IF I'M RIGHT I HOPE I'M GONG TA DOUBLE TRIP MY MONEY IF I'M WRONG
YOU1000000183_S0000091	MALL LOSE THIRTY FORTY PERCENT THAT'S A FAVOR RATIO YOU SAY IF I'M RIGHT THE STOCK'S NOT ONG O UP IT'S ALREADY DISCOUNTING TERRIFIC THINGS IF DISCOUNTING TERRIFIC THINGS ARE ALREDY IN THE STOCK I DON'T
YOU1000000183_S0000092	SO FIRST STEP IS TO FIND A COMPANY WHERE YOU'VE GOT THE EDGE THE SECOND STEP IS TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE BUSINESS UNDERSTAND THE FINANCIALS UNDERSTAND THE FUNDAMENTALS
YOU1000000183_S0000093	BUT THEN WHAT PETER LYNCH TALKS ABOUT IN THIS ENVIRONMENT WHERE BASICALLY EVERYTHING'S OVERVALUED WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO TRY AND FIND COMPANIES THAT ARE JUST FAIRLY VALUED
YOU1000000183_S0000094	EVEN IN THIS EXTREME OVERVALUED ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE AS INVESTORS WHAT WE DO IS WE BUY UNDERVALUED STOCKS RIGHT WE ALWAYS BUY AT A DISCOUNT TO INTRINSIC VALUE
YOU1000000183_S0000095	THAT'S HOW WE KNOW WE MAKE MONEY IN THE LONG RUN NOW IF YOU FIND A COMPANY THAT'S REALLY GREAT BUT IT'S ALSO REALLY EXPENSIVE IN THIS ENVIRONMENT
YOU1000000183_S0000096	AND THEN THERE'S SOME SORT OF YOU KNOW TEN FIFTEEN PERCENT MARKET DIP AND IT BRINGS THE STOCK BACK DOWN TO FAIR VALUE WELL THEN REMEMBER YOU'RE STILL IT'S STILL LIKE PAYING
YOU1000000183_S0000097	FULL RETAIL FOR THAT STOCK SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS GREAT BUSINESSES THAT IN THIS OVERVALUED ENVIRONMENT ARE JUST FAIRLY VALUED
YOU1000000183_S0000098	SOIF ANYTHING DOES HAPPEN SUDDENLY IN THE MARKET SOMETHING CAUSES A TEN PERCENT DIP OR A FIFTEEN PERCENT DIP THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT BUSINESS GOES FROM BEING AF FAIRE VALUE
YOU1000000183_S0000099	TO NOW BEING UNDERVALUED SO THEY'RE THE KIND OF SITUATIONS WE'RE LOOKING FOR IMAGINE THIS THE NEW XBOX ONE X CONSOLE FULL RETAIL
YOU1000000183_S0000100	PRICE I THINK IS SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS IF YOU WENT INTO SAY
YOU1000000183_S0000102	EB GAMES AND THEY WERE SELLING THAT XBOX FOR YOU KNOW THAT IT WAS A THOUSAND DOLLARS AND NOW IT'S DROPPED DOWN TO SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
YOU1000000183_S0000103	YOU'RE NOT GETTING EXCITED BY THAT DEAL BECAUSE IT'S JUST COME BACK DOWN TO FULL PRICE BUT IF THAT SAME STORE WAS OFFERING YOU KNOW IT STARTED AT SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY FULL RE AI
YOU1000000183_S0000104	AND THEN IT DROPPED DOWN TO FIVE HUNDRED WELL OBVIOUSLY THAT'S A MUCH BETTER DEAL EXACTLY THE SAME THING WITH BUSINESSES IN THE STOCK MARKET
YOU1000000183_S0000105	AND JUST QUICKLY THE OTHER THING TO NOTE FROM WHAT PETER LYNCH SAID IN THIS LITTLE CLIP WAS WHEN HE SAID IF A STOCK IS TRADING AT A HUGE MULTIPLE IT BASICALLY HAS TO WORK
YOU1000000183_S0000106	RIGHT AND IF IT DOES WORK OUT THEN YOU'RE STILL JUST EVEN NOW EVEN TODAY WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS SOME COMPANIES THEY MIGHT BE GREAT COMPANIES BUT THEY'RE TRADING AT P RATIOS IN THE HUNDREDS
YOU1000000183_S0000107	IF NOT LITERALLY THE THOUSANDS LIKE SOME COMPANIES FOR INSTANCE LIKE TESLA I THINK HAS A P RATIO OF ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED
YOU1000000183_S0000108	NOW WHAT THIS MEANS IS IT MEANS THAT THE PRICE THAT INVESTORS ARE PAYING TODAY THIS IS ALREADY THEY ARE EXPECTING FLAWLESS CONTINUED GROWTH
YOU1000000183_S0000109	OR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS TO COME THAT'S WHAT THE SHARE PRICE IS TELLING US NOW IF YOU INVEST IN A COMPANY LIKE THIS AT THESE PRICES
YOU1000000183_S0000110	THEN THERE'S VERY LITTLE ROOM FOR UPSIDE AND THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF ROOM FOR DOWNSIDE BECAUSE INVESTORS RIGHT NOW ARE ALREADY EXPECTING YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS OF PERFECTION
YOU1000000183_S0000111	RIGHT OF ABSOLUTELY PERFECT EXECUTION AS PETER LYNCH SAYS YOU HAVE TO FACTOR IN IF I'M RIGHT HOW MUCH AM I GOING TO MAKE
YOU1000000183_S0000112	AND IF I'M WRONG HOW MUCH AM I GOING TO LOSE AND THAT'S A VERY THET'S A VERY IMPORTANT COUPLE OF QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELF BEFORE BUYING INTO A STOCK
YOU1000000183_S0000113	AND THAT'S WHERE YOU GO BACK TO YOUR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS AND YOU LOOK AT THE GROWTH RATES TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT RISK RATIO IS FOR THE COMPANY THAT YOU'RE LOOKING A
YOU1000000183_S0000114	WHAT YOU'RE SAYING TO PEOPLE TODAY ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE MARKET OVER THE NEAR TERM IS WHAT WHAT'S YOUR FEE
YOU1000000183_S0000115	ECAN TA GT TE BUY BUSINWE CAN TAKE A COIN OUT AND FLIP IT I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE NEXT THOUSAND POINTS GOING TO DO
YOU1000000183_S0000116	THE NEXT SIX THOUSAND POINTS CAN BE UP THE NEXT FOURTEEN THOUSAND POINTS CAN BE UP THE NEXT TWENTY THOUSAND POINTS CAN BE UP
YOU1000000183_S0000117	BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHATE THE NEXT THOUSAND IS GONN
YOU1000000183_S0000118	OBODY DOS CULD UP NOBODY DOES
YOU1000000183_S0000119	NAND IT'S FUTILE TO TRY AND GUESS IT CORPORATE PROFITS WILL BE A LOT HIGHER TEN YEARS FROM NOW THE'LL BE A LOT HIGHER TWENTY YEAR FROM NOW THAT'S WHAT YOU COULD RELY ON
YOU1000000183_S0000120	THE THIRD KEY STEP THAT PETER LYNCH HIGHLIGHTS IN THIS CLIP IS TO ALWAYS FOCUS ON THE LONG TERM
YOU1000000183_S0000121	DON'T BE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THE MARKET WILL DO NEXT WEEK NEXT MONTH OR EVEN NEXT YEAR WHAT YOU SHOULD BE REALLY FOCUSED ON IS WHAT IS THIS COMPANY GOING TO LOOK LIKE IN FIVE YEARS FROM NOW
YOU1000000183_S0000122	IN TEN YEARS FROM NOW ALWAYS FOCUS ON THE LONG TERM BECAUSE IF YOU CAN DO THAT THEN SHORT TERM MARKET FLUCTUATIONS THEY REALLY DON'T MATTER
YOU1000000183_S0000123	AND YOU JUST DON'T STRESS ABOUT THEM AT ALL IN FACT WHEN PRICES GO DOWN YOU GET EXCITED YOU DON'T GET SCARED
YOU1000000183_S0000124	AS PETER LYNCH SAYS YOU KNOW CORPORATE PROFITS WILL BE A LOT HIGHER IN TEN YEARS FROM NOW THEY'LL BE A LOT HIGHER IN TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW AND THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO RELY ON SO
YOU1000000183_S0000125	WE RELY ON THE FACT THAT YES BUSINESSES ARE GOING TO CONTINUALLY IMPROVE NOT MAYBE NOT OVER THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING LIKE WHAT WE SAW WITH THE LOCKDOWN WHERE BUSINESS IS IMPAIRED FOR LIKE A WHOLE YEAR OR TWO
YOU1000000183_S0000126	IT STILL DOESN'T MATTER TO US BECAUSE WE LOOK FOR SITUATIONS WHERE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN OVER FIVE YEARS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN OVER TEN YEARS
YOU1000000183_S0000127	AND IF THAT SITUATION IS FAVOURABLE THAT'S WHEN WE INVEST
YOU1000000183_S0000128	WHAT ABOUT ALL THE CRITICISM OF DERIVATIVES AND THE IMPACT THEY HAVE HAD
YOU1000000183_S0000129	THAT'S A LITTLE COMPLICATED FORME
YOU1000000183_S0000130	ALL I KNOW IS I MEAN I DON' KNOW ABOUT TE RIVE R YOU IT'S WAY OVER MY HEAD I'VE NEVER BOUGHT AN OPTION IN MY LIFE I NEVER BUDED I TIME'S ON YOUR SIE WHEN YOU' OWN A STOCK YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW ABOUT PUTTING YOU KNOW THREE PERCENT DOWN AND BUYING A FUTURE AND A STRAP AND A STRATTAL THAT'S WAY OVER MY HEAD
YOU1000000183_S0000132	LRIGHT SO YOU'RE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY EARNINGS POTENTIAL FOR MOST WELL RUN COMPANIES WILL DO ALL RIGHT
YOU1000000183_S0000133	BUT PEOPLE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WE'VE HAD NINE RECESSIONS SINCE WORLD WAR TWO
YOU1000000183_S0000134	WE'LL HAVE OTHER RECESSIONS
YOU1000000183_S0000135	IN ONE NOW
YOU1000000183_S0000136	BUT WE MAY HAVE ONE IN THE FUTURE AND DON'T GET WORRIED A WE'LL HAVE ONE SOMETIME IT'ILL APPEN AND NO ON WILL TELL YOU WHEN IT'S GONNA HAPPEN
YOU1000000183_S0000137	BUWON'T THE FUNDAMENTALS TELL YOU
YOU1000000183_S0000138	NO YOU'LL FIND OUT AFTER THE FACT YOU'LL ALL OF A SUDDE YOU'LL NOTICE ORDER'S SLOWING PRICES GET MORE COMPETITIVE THEN EARNINGS ARE DOWN IMEAN USUALY YOU FIND OUT AFTRE FACT NO ONE DEC EVERYBODY'S BEEN SAYING WE'RE GON NA HAE RECESSION FOR FIVE YEARS IT JUST HASN'T HAPPENED
YOU1000000183_S0000139	IT'S GREAT TO SEEYOU I HOPE YOU'LL COME BACK ANYTIME PETER
YOU1000000183_S0000140	YOU KNOW I REALLY LIKE THIS LAST CLIP FROM PETER LYNCH IT'S JUST A LESSON YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET TOO FANCY RIGHT YOU DON'T HAVE TO DRIFT INTO THINGS THAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND LIKE A LOT OF STOCK INVESTORS
YOU1000000183_S0000141	THEY ARE JUST ALL OVER OPTIONS PETER LINCH IS THE FIRST O PUT HIS HAND UP AND SAYS LOOK I LOVE INVESTING IN COMPANIES I DON'T HAVE A CLUE WHAT'S GOING ON WHN IT COMES TO OPTIONS NEVER BOUGHT AN OPTION IN MY LIFE
YOU1000000183_S0000142	SO YOU KNOW STEP ONE FIND THE BUSINESSES YOURE YOU KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND
YOU1000000183_S0000143	STEP TWO YOU KNOW MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN MAKE SURE YOU'RE LOOKING AT FAIRLY VALUED BUSINESSES THAT CAN GO UNDERVALUED
YOU1000000183_S0000144	STEP THREE FOCUS ON THE LONG RUN FIND SOLID BUSINESSES WITH LOW DEBTS HIGH CASH FLOWS AND JUST KEEP FOCUSED ON THAT STUFF BECAUSE THAT'S THE WINNING FORMULA YOU KNOW
YOU1000000183_S0000145	WE ARE GOING TO SEE RECESSIONS IN THE FUTURE WE'VE SEEN RECESSIONS IN THE PAST IT COULD HAPPEN TOMORROW IT COULD HAPPEN NEXT WEEK IT COULD HAPPEN IN A YEAR'S TIME OR FIVE YEARS FROM NOW
YOU1000000183_S0000146	BUT THE MAIN THING IS THAT STRONG COMPANIES WITH SOLID CASH FLOWS THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HOLD FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME
YOU1000000183_S0000147	THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH AND THEY'RE THE ONES WE SHOULD BE ULTRA FOCUSED ON IN ANY STOCK MARKET ENVIRONMENT SO

YOU1000000184_S0000001	'M BOB KLEIN FROM LOS ANGELES I WONDER IF YOU COULD GIVE US A GLIMPSE INTO YOUR INVESTMENT PROCESS HWAY YOU APPROACH LOOKING AT A PARTICULAR INDUSTRY AND I WONDER IF YOU COULD USE REAL ESTATE AS AN EXAMPLE
YOU1000000184_S0000002	I KNOW REAL ESTATE HASN'T BEEN A BIG HUGE PART OF BERKSHIRE'S PORTFOLIO OVER THE YEARS AND I WONDER IF THAT'S BECAUSE YOU VIEW REAL ESTATE AS A COMMODITY BUSINESS
YOU1000000184_S0000003	OR I MAYBE THE CASH FLOWS FROM REAL ESTATE TEND TO BE MORE PREDICTABLE THAN PERHAPS FROM SOME OTHER INDUSTRIES
YOU1000000184_S0000005	IT TENDS TO BE LESS LIKELY TO BE MISPRICED AND AND THEREFORE LESS LIKELY TO FIND TERRIFIC BARGAINS IN REAL ESTATE
YOU1000000184_S0000006	
YOU1000000184_S0000007	GO AHEAD
YOU1000000184_S0000008	SO JUST WONDERING IF WE COULD IFIF WE WERE WATCHING A DISCUSSION BETWEEN YOU AND CHARLIE HASHING OUT THE MERIT S OF REAL ESTATE HOW HOW IT WOULD GO
YOU1000000184_S0000009	WELL IT WOULD GO LIKE ALL OUR OTHER CONVERSATIONS HE WOULD SAY NO FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES ANDTHEN

YOU1000000184_S0000013	YEAH
YOU1000000184_S0000015	WE BOTH HAD A FAIR AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCE IN REAL ESTATE AND CHARLIE MADE I EARLY MONEY IN REAL ESTATE
YOU1000000184_S0000016	THSECOND POINT IS THE MORE IMPORTANT PONT I'S NOT REAL ESTATE IS NOT A COMMODITY BUT
YOU1000000184_S0000018	I THINK IT TENDS TO BE MORE ACCURATELY PRICED
YOU1000000184_S0000019	PARTICULARLY DEVELOPED REAL ESTATE MORE ACCURATELY PRICED MOST OF THE TIME
YOU1000000184_S0000020	N DURING THE RTC PERIOD WHEN YOU HAD HUGE AMOUNTS OF TRANSACTIONS AND YOU HAD A YOU HAD AN OWNER THAT DIDN'T WANT TO BE AOWNER IN A VERY BIG WAY AND THEY DIDN' NOW WHAT THE HELL THEY OWNED AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING
YOU1000000184_S0000021	I MEAN YOU HAD A LOT OF MISPRICING THEN AND I KNOW A FEW PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM THAT MADE A LOT OF MONEY OFF OF THAT BUT
YOU1000000184_S0000023	UNDER
YOU1000000184_S0000025	MOST CONDITIONS IT'S IT'S HARD TO FIND REAL ESTATE THAT'S REALLY MISPRICED I MEAN WHEN I LOOK AT WHEN I LOOK AT THE TRANSACTIONS THAT REEDS ENGAGE IN CURRENTLY AND YOU GET A LOT OF INFORMATION ON THAT SORT OF THING
YOU1000000184_S0000026	YOU KNOW THEYE THEY'RE VERY SIMILAR
YOU1000000184_S0000028	BUT IT'S A COMPETITIVE WORLD AND
YOU1000000184_S0000029	AND YOU KNOW THEY ALL KNOW ABOUT WHAT A CLASSI OFFICE BUILDING IN YOU KNOW IN CHICAGO OR WHEREVER IT MAY BE IS GOING TO PRODUCE AT LEAST THEY HAVE THEY MAY ALL BE WRONG AS IT TURNS OUT BECAUSE OF SOME UNUSUAL EVENTS BUT
YOU1000000184_S0000030	BUT IT'S HARD TO ARGUE WITH THE CURRENT CONVENTIONAL WISDOM MOST OF THE TIME IN THE REAL ESTATE WORLD
YOU1000000184_S0000031	BUT OCCASIONALLY THER THERE'VE BEEN SOME YOU KNOW THER THE THERE COULD BE BIG OPPORTUNITIES IN THE FIELD BUT IF IF THEY EXIST
YOU1000000184_S0000033	IT WILL CERTAINLY BE BECAUSE THERE'S PROBABLY THERE'LL BE A LOT OF CHAOS IN REAL ESTATE FINANCING FOR ONE REASON R OTHER WE'VE DONE SOME REAL ESTATE FINANCING AND
YOU1000000184_S0000035	YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE MONEY SHUT OFF
YOU1000000184_S0000037	TO QUITE A DEGREE PROBABLY TO GET ANY BIG MISPRICING ACROSS THE BOARD CHARLIE
YOU1000000184_S0000039	YEAHWE DON'T HAVE
YOU1000000184_S0000041	COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OVER EXPERIENCED REAL ESTATE INVESTORS IN THE FIELD
YOU1000000184_S0000043	D WE WOULDN'T HAVE IF WE WERE OPERATING WITH OUR OWN MONEY AS A PARTNERSHIP
YOU1000000184_S0000045	DIF YOU OPERATE AS A CORPORATION SUCH AS OURS WHICH IS TAXABLE UNDER
YOU1000000184_S0000047	CHAPTER C OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE YOUE GOT A WHOLE LAYER OF CORPORATE TAXES
YOU1000000184_S0000048	BETWEEN THE REAL ESTATE INCOME AND THE USE OF THE INCOME BY THE PEOPLE WHO OWN THE REAL ESTATE SO
YOU1000000184_S0000050	BY ITS NATURE REAL ESTATE TENDS TO BE A VERY LOUSY INVESTMENT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE TAXED UNDER SUBCHAPTER C OF THE CODE RELATING TO CORPORATIONS SO THE COMBINATION OF HAVING IT
YOU1000000184_S0000052	GENERALLY ALLOWS THE ACTIVITY FOR PEOPLE WITH OUR TAX STRUCTURE AND HAVING NO SPECIAL COMPETENCE IN THE FIELD
YOU1000000184_S0000053	MEANS THAT WE SPEND ALMOST NO TIME THINKING ABOUT ANYTHING IN REAL ESTATE AND THEN SUCH REAL ESTATE AS WE'VE ACTUALLY
YOU1000000184_S0000055	DONE LIKE HOLDING SURF
YOU1000000184_S0000057	I'D SAY WE HAVE A POOR RECORD AT
YOU1000000184_S0000059	SCORPS REALLY IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE I MEAN I KNOW THERE ARE SEA CORPS AROUND THAT THAT ARE IN REAL ESTATE BUT THERE ARE OTHER STRUCTURES THAT ARE MORE ATTRACTIVE THERE REALLY AREN'T OTHER STRUCTURES
YOU1000000184_S0000060	A I MEAN LOYD'S IS AN ATTEMPT AT IT TO SOME DEGRE BUT THERE AREN'T OTHER STRUCTURES THAT WORK WELL FOR BIG INSURANCE COMPANIES OR I MEAN YOU CAN'T HAVE A WALMART VERY WELL THAT THAT DOES NOT EXIST IN A SEA COURTE
YOU1000000184_S0000061	THEY ARE NOT SUBJECT TO SCORP OR PARTNERSHIP COMPETITION THAT DETERMINES THE RETURNS ON CAPITAL IN IN THE DISCOUNT TO OUR FIELD
YOU1000000184_S0000062	BUT IF YOU'RE COMPETING WITH S T EQUIVALENT OF S CORPS
YOU1000000184_S0000064	OR PARTNERSHIPS OR INDIVIDUALS
YOU1000000184_S0000065	YOU YOU'VE JUST GOT AN ECONOMIC DISADVANTAGE AS A CC CORP WHICH IS FOR THE THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T LOVE READING THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE
YOU1000000184_S0000067	ORPORATION THAT YOU THINK OF ALL F THE DOW JONES COMPANIES ALL OF THE SND P COMPANIES AND SO ON
YOU1000000184_S0000069	AND THE
YOU1000000184_S0000071	CHARLIE SAYS IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THAT THE DISADVANTAGE OF OUR STRUCTURE COMBINED WITH THE COMPETITIVE NATURE OF PEOPLE WITH BETTER STRUCTURES BUYING THOSE KINDS OF ASSETS WILL EVER LEAD TO ANYTHING
YOU1000000184_S0000072	REALLY INTERESTING ALTHOUGH I WOULD SAY THAT WE MISSED THE BOAT TO SOME EXTENT DURING THE RTC DAYS I MEAN H
YOU1000000184_S0000074	IT WAS A SUFFICIENTLY INEFFICIENT MARKET AT THAT TIME AND THERE WAS A LACK OF FINANCING THAT WE COULD HAVE MADE A LOT OF MONEY IF WE WER HAD BEEN GEARED UP FOR IT AT THAT TIME
YOU1000000184_S0000075	WE ACTUALLY HAD A FEW TRANSACTIONS THAT WERE PRETTY INTERESTING BUT NOT BUT NOTHING THAT WAS SIGNIFICANT IN RELATION TO OUR TOTAL CAPITAL
YOU1000000184_S0000076	WE THOUGHT SIGNIFICANTLY ABOUT BUYING THE URVINE CORPORATION WHEN IT BECAME AVAILABLE SO
YOU1000000184_S0000078	THAT'S THE ONLY BIG ONE I CAN REMEMBER THAT WE SERIOUSLY THOUGHT ABUT
YOU1000000184_S0000080	THAT WAS HE NINETEEN SEVENTY
YOU1000000184_S0000082	YEAH MOBILE OIL WAS INTERESTED YOU KNOW DON BRENNT ENDED UP PUTTING TOGETHER A GROUP FORIT BUT YOU KNOW THAT KIND OF THING

YOU1000000185_S0000009	AS YOU'VE LIKELY SEEN A FEW YEARS AGO BILL BROUGHT ATTENTION TO THE RISKS OF A DEADLY GLOBAL PANDEMIC SADLY HIS WARNING IS NOW OUR REALITY
YOU1000000185_S0000010	THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT HE AND MELINDA HAVE COMMITTED THEMSELVES AND THEIR ORGANIZATION TO FINDING A SOLUTION AND THAT GIVES US ALL A SENSE OF HOPE
YOU1000000185_S0000011	THE BILLA MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION HAS COMMITTED MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO THE GLOBAL COVID NINETEEN RESPONSE
YOU1000000185_S0000012	WE'RE SO GRATEFUL FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP DURING THIS TRYING MOMENT AND EXCITED TO TALK TO THEM TODAY
YOU1000000185_S0000013	THIS EPISODE WAS PRERECORDED TO FIT THEIR BUSY SCHEDULES SO THERE WON'T BE AUDIENCE QUESTIONS AT THE END THIS TIME BUT THERE'S A LOT THAT WE GET TO TALK ABOUT AND SO LET'S GET TO IT
YOU1000000185_S0000015	WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING WITH US WE HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS WE IL JUST WANT TO JUMP RIGHT IN AND SO LET ME ASK YOU BOTH
YOU1000000185_S0000016	WHAT IS THE GATES FOUNDATION DOING TO FIGHT THE CORONAVIRUS AND AND WHY IS IT SUCH A PRIORITY FOR YOU
YOU1000000185_S0000018	OUR FOUNDATION HAS A
YOU1000000185_S0000020	BIG FOCUS ON INFECTIOUS DISEASES THAT YOU KNOW KILL MILLIONS OF PEOPLE PRIMARILY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
YOU1000000185_S0000021	AND SO YU K OUR UNDERSTANDING ABOUT HOW YOU DESIGN A VACCINE WE'E FUNDED LOTS OF NEW VACCINES
YOU1000000185_S0000022	WE'RE A PARTNER IN GOBI WHICH ACTUALLY BUYS VACCINES FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND WE HAVE A LOT OF THE EXPERTISE THAT'S NOT IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO PI
YOU1000000185_S0000023	WHICH OF THESE WE SHOULD BUILD FACTORIES FOR AND HOW WE COORDINATE ALL THIS ACTIVITY AND SO IT'S BECOME A HUGE FOCUS FORCE
YOU1000000185_S0000024	AND OF COURSE THE BENEFIT OF GETTING THE VACCINE YOU KNOW EVEN THREE OR FOUR MONTHS EARLIER WILL BE VERY DRAMATIC IN TERMS OF ENDING THESE
YOU1000000185_S0000025	AWPUL ECONOMIC EFFECTS AS WELL AS THE DEATH AND DISEASE
YOU1000000185_S0000027	MELINDA WHEN DO YOU THINK WILL SEE A VACCINE AT SCALE NDAN D A TWO PART QUESTION
YOU1000000185_S0000028	SE YOU'VE ALSO TALKED BEAUTIFULLY ABOUT THE NEED TO HAVE AN EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF A VACCINE SO KIND OF WHEN DO YOU SEE THIS AT SCALE AND WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE DISTRIBUTION EQUITABLE
YOU1000000185_S0000029	YESH SO I THINK WE ALL BELIEVE THAT JUST SEEING THE VARIOUS VACCINE CANDIDATES THAT ARE COMING THROUGH THE PIPELINE THERE ARE THREE THAT ARE LOOKING QUITE PROMISING LUCKILY
YOU1000000185_S0000030	AND I THINK WE ALL BELIEVE THAT BY TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE WILL HAVE A VACCINE
YOU1000000185_S0000031	WE'RE WORKING AHEAD OF TIME WITH THE AS WITH THE MANUFACTURERS WITH THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES TO TRY AND ACTUALLY HAVE MANUFACTURING CAPABILITY READY TO GO
YOU1000000185_S0000032	SO AS SOON AS THOSE TRIALS ARE FINISHED THE VACCINE CAN GO IMMEDIATELY INTO TH MANUFACTURING
YOU1000000185_S0000033	AND THE WHOLE REASON WE GOT INVOLVED IN THIS VACCINE WAS TO MAKE SURE THERE'S EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION
YOU1000000185_S0000034	THE LAST THING YOU WANT IS A BIDDING WAR BETWEEN COUNTRIES FOR THIS VACCINE YOU KNOW WE KNOW THERE ARE SIXTY MILLION HEALTH CARE WORKERS AROUND THE WORLD
YOU1000000185_S0000035	WHO ARE KEEPING EVERYBODY SAFE THEY DESERVE TO GET THIS VACCINE FIRST AND FROM THERE YOU WANT TO DO TEERING IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES
YOU1000000185_S0000036	TO MAKE SURE YOUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS GET IT IN OUR COUNTRY THAT WOULD BE BLACKS AND NATIVE AMERICANS PEOPLE WITH UNDERLYING HEALTH CONDITIONS AND THE ELDERLY
YOU1000000185_S0000037	AND SO WE NEED TO LOOK AT AS A GLOBE AND WE'RE INVOLVED WITH MANY EUROPEAN LEADERS AND AFRICAN LEADERS AND OTHERS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA TO MAKE SURE
YOU1000000185_S0000038	THERE'S A PURCHASING FUND THAT CAN PULL THAT VACCINE THROUGH WHEN IT'S AVAILABLE AND GET IT OUT IN WIDE SCALE DISTRIBUTION
YOU1000000185_S0000040	GOSH I HAVE SO MANY FOLLOWUP QUESTIONS I'LL TRY TO STAY FOCUSED SO LET ME GO BACK TO BILL FOR A SECOND YOU GOT WIDESPREAD ATTENTION FOR A PREDICTION YOU MADE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN
YOU1000000185_S0000041	BOUT THE DANGERS OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC AND YOU SADLY FOR THE WORLD DID PREDICT THE FUTURE AND SO LET ME ASK YOU TO DO IT AGAIN YOU KNOW WHAT ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT NOW
YOU1000000185_S0000043	WELL THIS WON'T BE THE LAST PANDEMIC THAT WE FACE YOU KNOW PANDEMICS CAN COME FROM NATURAL CAUSES
YOU1000000185_S0000044	WHICH IS LARGELY COMING ACROSS FROM OTHER SPECIES YOU KNOW A FLU FOR EXAMPLE IS STILL A VERY BIG RISK
YOU1000000185_S0000045	AND SO WE'LL HAVE TO INVEST
YOU1000000185_S0000047	IN MAKING SURE THAT WE CATCH THE DISEASE SOONER AND THAT WE HAVE PLATFORMS TO MAKE DIAGNOSTICS THERAPEUTICS AND VACCINES VERY QUICKLY
YOU1000000185_S0000048	VERY LITTLE WAS INVESTED EVEN THOUGH THERE WERE THESE CALLS BY A LOT OF PEOPLE INCLUDING OUR FOUNDATION
YOU1000000185_S0000049	ONE GROUP THAT WAS FUNDED THE COALITION FOR EPIDEMIC PREPAREDNESS INNOVATION SEPI CEPI
YOU1000000185_S0000050	WE WELCOME TROUS NORWAY U K JAPAN WERE THE INITIAL FUNDERS AND THAT IS HELPING OUT HERE
YOU1000000185_S0000051	SO WE'RE BETTER OFF THAN IF THAT HADN'T HAPPENED BUT YOU KNOW PEOPLE TRUST GOVERNMENT TO THINK THROUGH
YOU1000000185_S0000052	THESE EVENTUAL BAD THINGS THIS WAS A FAILURE TO TO GET READY
YOU1000000185_S0000053	AND THE COST WOULD HAVE BEEN TINY COMPARED TO SAY WHAT WE SPEND ON BEING READY FOR WAR WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY DO THE SIMULATION TO THINK ABOUT
YOU1000000185_S0000054	OKAY WHAT ABOUT NURSING HOMES WHAT ABOUT GETTING FACTORIES READY WHAT ABOUT THE TESTING REGIME
YOU1000000185_S0000055	YOU KNOW IN FACT THE TESTING COULD HAVE BEEN RAMPED UP VERY QUICKLY IN A FEW COUNTRIES THAT HAVE ALMOST AVOIDED THE EPIDEMIC ENTIRELY LIKE
YOU1000000185_S0000057	H TAIWAN NEW ZEALAND AUSTRALIA YOU KNOW THEY TOOK THEIR EXPERIENCE AND ACTUALLY PREPARED AND SO THEY MOVED A LOT FASTER A
YOU1000000185_S0000058	SO WE
YOU1000000185_S0000060	WE'LL HAVE TO PREPARE FOR THE NEXT ONE THAT
YOU1000000185_S0000062	KNO I'D SAY IS WE'LL GET ATTENTION THIS TIME
YOU1000000185_S0000064	SO YOU KNOW THAT REMINDS ME OF GOING BACK TO THE VACCINE MELINDA AND I PROMISED TO MOVE OFF OF IT BUT YOU KNOW WE'VE NEVER HAD A VACCINE FOR CORONAVIRUS
YOU1000000185_S0000065	THAT MAKES PEOPLE NERVOUS ABOUT THIS TIME SO I THINK THE AUDIENCE WILL BE SO PLEASED TO HEAR YOUR OPTIMISM FOR THIS RIGHT BUT
YOU1000000185_S0000066	WHAT DO YOU THINK IS DIFFERENT THIS TIME THAT MAKES US THINK THE DEVELOPMENT WILL HAPPEN IS IT THIS GLOBAL COORDINATION
YOU1000000185_S0000067	IT'S THIS IT'S THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES WORKING TOGETHER WITH SCIENTISTS FROM ALL OVER THE GLOBE IN A VERY COORDINATED FASHION
YOU1000000185_S0000068	WE HAVE NEVER SEEN THE COMPANIES COME TOGETHER IN THIS WAY AND ALSO TO BE THINKING AHEAD ABOUT MANUFACTUR
YOU1000000185_S0000069	MANUFACTURING NOT JUST FOR THEIR OWN COUNTRY OR THEIR OWN REGION BUT FOR OTHER PLACES IN THE WORLD AND SO THAT'S WHAT MAKES US OPTIMISTIC IS THE MANY MANY CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'RE HAVING
YOU1000000185_S0000070	THE WAY WE'RE SEEING THE SCIENTISTS MOVE FORWARD WITH THE DATA AS SOON AS THEY GET IT AND ALSO SEEING GLOBAL LEADERS COME TOGETHER
YOU1000000185_S0000071	LIKE THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION DID A HUGE PLEDGING EVENT FOR THIS VACCINE ALLIANCE THAT WE'VE BEEN PART OF AND SEEING MONEY COME TOGETHER TO SAY
YOU1000000185_S0000072	WE NEED THIS SO THAT IT'S READY WHEN THE VACCINE'S READY TO GO WE CAN ACTUALLY PURCHASE T THAT VACCINE FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD
YOU1000000185_S0000074	N DO YOU THINK BILL THE SAME THING IS TRUE ON THERAPEUTICS AND TESTING I MEAN DO YOU THINK THAT THE WAY THAT THINGS ARE COMING TOGETHER WILL GET US WHERE WE NEED TO BE
YOU1000000185_S0000075	THE OTHER SIDES OF THE EQUATION AS WELL
YOU1000000185_S0000077	ELL PEOPLE ARE CAUGHT A LITTLE BIT FLATFOOTED IN THAT USUALLY THE U S IS VERY WELL ORGANIZED SO THE U
YOU1000000185_S0000078	THIS NEW DRUG THAT GOT PROVEN OUT THAT'S A TRIAL NETWORK WE FUNDED WITH OTHERS WITH WELCOME TRUST IN THE UK
YOU1000000185_S0000079	YOU KNOW USUALLY YOU EXPECT THE U S TO DO GOOD COORDINATED TRIALS AND YOU KNOW TO PICK DRUGS FOR THEIR SCIENTIFIC MERIT
YOU1000000185_S0000080	THE WORLD HAS HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A HARD TIME WHEN THE THE US TESTING THING WENT IN THE WRONG DIRECTION
YOU1000000185_S0000081	WHEN IT HASN'T BEEN YOU KNOW A FEDERAL NOTION OF HOW YOU PRIORITIZE THINGS BUT I HAVE TO SAY THE EUROPEANS R ARE FILLING THAT VACUUM PARTICULARLY IN TERMS OF CARING
YOU1000000185_S0000082	FOR THE ENTIRE WORLD THEIR GENEROSITY HAS BEEN QUITE GOOD A YOU KNOW PEOPLE HOPE THAT THE U S COMES BACK A
YOU1000000185_S0000083	ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW WITHDRAWING FROM WH O'S IS A STEP IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION BUT HISTORICALLY THE U S YOU KNOW WE DID SMALLPOX ERADICATION
YOU1000000185_S0000084	ROADERY'S BEEN BEHIND THE POLIO PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE WHICH IS DONE THROUGH W HO
YOU1000000185_S0000085	YOU KNOW A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE US MONEY IS THAT GOES THERE IS FOR THAT POLIO ERADICATION AND SO YOU KNOW THERE'S STILL A CHANCE FOR THE US
YOU1000000185_S0000086	O CONTRIBUTE ON THIS AND YOU KNOW NOT JUST THINKING OF ITSELF BUT ALSO IN THE SAME WAY WE DID
YOU1000000185_S0000087	AND PARTICULARLY PRESIDENT BUSH AND PEPARD DID HELPING OUT THE ENTIRE WORLD
YOU1000000185_S0000089	U KNOW YOU'VE BOTH BEEN REALLY VOCAL ABOUT THE NEED TO MAKE THIS A GLOBAL RESPONSE AND TO HELP PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF OUR BORDERS
YOU1000000185_S0000090	IF YOU WERE TALKING TO IN THIS AUDIENCE A SMALL BUSINESS PERSON NIN THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY SOMEWHERE WHO MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND THAT
YOU1000000185_S0000091	EXPLAIN WHY YOU THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE REACH BEYOND OUR BORDERS AND HELP CONTROL THIS VIRUS
YOU1000000185_S0000092	WELL I THINK YOU KNOW COVID ANYWHERE IS COVID EVERYWHERE AND SO FOR A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER
YOU1000000185_S0000093	YOU KNOW THE SUPPLIES THAT COME IN THAT HELP YOU RUN YOUR BUSINESS DON'T ALL NECESSARILY COME FROM THE UNITED STATES
YOU1000000185_S0000095	AND YOUR CUSTOMERS PROBABLY AREN'T ALL JUST U S CUSTOMERS AND SO IF WE WANT TO HAVE GLOBAL TRADE AND A GLOBAL SUPPLY
YOU1000000185_S0000096	GLOBAL MANUFACTURING WE HAVE TO GET THE WHOLE WORLD COORDINATED IN ITS RESPONSE TO THIS DISEASE BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE CONTAINED
YOU1000000185_S0000097	IN ONE OR TWO PLACES EVEN ONCE WE'VE GOTTEN IT OUTSIDE OF THE US BORDERS
YOU1000000185_S0000098	AND TO PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE THE US HAS SPENT TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO TRY AND DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM HERE WE'RE ONLY TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW LESS THAN A FEW PERCENT
YOU1000000185_S0000099	THAT OF THAT THAT WOULD NEED TO BE SPENT ON HELPING GET RID OF THE DISEASE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD
YOU1000000185_S0000100	IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S SOME GIGANTIC TRADEOFF YOU KNOW THESE ARE VERY SMALL DOLLARS JUST LIKE YOU KNOW THE WHO IS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR
YOU1000000185_S0000101	YOU KNOW FOR THINGS LIKE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH VACCINES POLIO COVERS A LOT OF DIFFERENT AREAS
YOU1000000185_S0000102	AND SO IT'S NOT COMPETING BUDGETWISE WITH THE LARGE SCALE RESOURCES
YOU1000000185_S0000104	YOU KNOW YOUR FOUNDATION DOES AMAZING WORK WE'VE BEEN LUCKY TO BE PARTNERS FOR A LONG TIME ON SOME K THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION WORK
YOU1000000185_S0000105	R VERY GRATEFUL TO RECEIVE THAT SUPPORT AND AMPLIFY THAT GOOD WORK AND IT MAKES ME WONDER ABOUT HOW THE WORLD IS CHANGING IN A BROADER SENSE
YOU1000000185_S0000106	AS A RESULT OF THIS VIRUS I MEAN WHAT DO YOU I MEAN MLINDA LET ME GO TO YOU FIRST WHAT DO YOU THINK WE'RE GONNA SEE IN TERMS OF SOME LASTING CHANGES
YOU1000000185_S0000107	AS A RESULT OF THIS HEALTH AND ECONOMIC CRISIS
YOU1000000185_S0000108	WELL I THINK THAT'S YET TO COME AND I THINK YOU KNOW IT'S UP TO US AS CITIZENS TO REBUILD THE WORLD THAT WE WANT
YOU1000000185_S0000109	I THINK THIS CRISIS HAS EXPOSED SOME OF THE GAPS AROUND THE WORLD BUT PARTICUARLY IN THE UNITED STATES
YOU1000000185_S0000110	AND ONE OF THOSE IN PARTICULAR ARE THE GENDER AND THE RACIAL INEQUITIES THAT EXIST
YOU1000000185_S0000111	IN TERMS OF GENDER YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT WOMEN DO TWO AND A HALF TIMES MORE WORK AT HOME THAN MEN DO AND THAT'S THE UNPAID LABOUR
YOU1000000185_S0000112	CARING FOR THE KIDS MAKING THE LUNCH MAKING SURE THEY'RE ONLINE LEARNING RIGHT NOW
YOU1000000185_S0000113	AND SO YOU KNOW IT WILL EXPOSE FOR US THAT IT IS JUST WAY PAST TIME THAT THE U S HAS A PAID FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE POLICY WE'RE THE ONLY INDUSTRIALIZED NATION THAT DOESN'T
YOU1000000185_S0000114	AND IF WE WANT TO PUT PEOPLE BACK TO WORK SAFELY AND KEEP THEIR FAMILIES SAKE FROM AND FROM GETTING SICK WE NEED TO HAVE PAID FAMILY MEDICAL
YOU1000000185_S0000115	AND SO I THINK CONGRESS IN ITS WISDOM AND TWO OF THE STIMULUS BILLS STARTED TO ADDRESS THAT WE NEED A LONG TERM SOLUTION
YOU1000000185_S0000116	THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY IS NOT ONLY HAS COVIRD EXPOSED THE GAPS IN THE SYSTEM IT'S ALSO SHOWED US OPPORTUNITIES LIKE THE FACT THAT KIDS COULD JUMP ON
YOU1000000185_S0000117	AND START LEARNING NOW UNFORTUNATELY IT'S NOT ALL KIDS BECAUSE MANY KIDS DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO A COMPUTER OR GOOD DIGITAL LITERACY ONLINE
YOU1000000185_S0000118	OR TEACHERS WHO KNEW HOW TO TTEACH ONLINE BUT WE KNOW NOW IT'S POSSIBLE AND SO I THINK NOW WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT TECHNOLOGY GETS SPREAD EQUITABLY
YOU1000000185_S0000119	ND THOSE GREAT LESSON PLANS AND ADVISING THAT CAN HAPPEN I THINK ONE LAST EXAMPLE I'LL GIVE ON DIGITAL IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD
YOU1000000185_S0000120	THERE ARE MANY MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE PHONES AND DO DIGITAL BANKING ON THEIR PHONE THEY HAVE ACCESS TO MONEY ON THEIR PHONE MOBILE MONEY THAT WAS AT SCALE IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES
YOU1000000185_S0000121	BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN PEOPLE REALLY SAID OH MY GOSH TO NOT HAVE TO STAND IN LINE FOR MY GOVERNMENT PAYMENT WHERE I MIGHT GET SICK
YOU1000000185_S0000122	SO JUST TO TAKE PAKISTAN ALONE IN FORTY EIGHT HOURS FORTY MILLION ADDITIONAL PEOPLE SIGNED UP FOR A DIGITAL BANK ACCOUNT THAT IS AN OPPORTUNITY WE CAN USE

YOU1000000185_S0000127	I LOVE THAT ANSWER BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A LOT WE'RE AFRAID OF RIGHT NOW BOTH IN TERMS OF HEALTH AND THE ECONOMY AND HOW TO WRITE THIS SOCIAL INJUSTICE SHIFT
YOU1000000185_S0000128	AND THERE'S A LOT WE'RE AFRAID OF AND IT'S NICE TO THINK ABOUT SOME OPTIMISTIC YOU KNOW OUTCOMES FOR THIS TOO SO THE OTHER DAY IN AN INTERVIEW DAVID REBENSTEIN ASKED ME

YOU1000000186_S0000031	E
YOU1000000186_S0000032	AND HE SAID THAT ONE OF THE GOOD QUALITIES ANY NGO SHOULD HAVE O ANY PERSON WHO WANTS TO BE PART OF O SOCIAL YOU KNOW SERVICE SHOULD HAVE IS THAT A
YOU1000000186_S0000034	IT'S NOT JUST THE EMOTION OF WANTING TO DO SOMETHING FOR SOMEBODY ELSE WHICH IS IN ITSELF A GOOD EMOTION THAT YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING FOR SOMEONE
YOU1000000186_S0000035	BUT IF YOU FEEL THAT YOUR LIFE IS INCOMPLETE IF YOU DON'T

YOU1000000186_S0000040	BUT I THINK IN ME WHAT GREW WAS THAT THIS FEELING THAT I THAT I NEEDED TO FOR MYSELF DO SOMETHING WHERE I FELT BETTER ABOUT MYSELF WHEN I FELT I WAS YOU KNOW I FEEL I'M SO PRIVILEGED IN SO MANY WAYS
YOU1000000186_S0000041	AND I FEEL THAT I REALLY FEEL THAT WHEN I SEE AROUND ME PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT AS PRIVILEGED I CAN'T JUST SIT BY AND BE COMFORTABLE
YOU1000000186_S0000042	THERE'S A NEED IN ME TO YOU KNOW REACH OUT AND PERHAPS

YOU1000000186_S0000048	I GUESS THAT'S WHY I'VE MOVED INTO THE SPACE WHERE I HAVE IT'S FOR MY OWN EMOTIONAL OR MENTAL YOU KNOW PEACE OF MIND AND SATISFACTION
YOU1000000186_S0000049	AND BILL GATES
YOU1000000186_S0000051	YOUVE ALSO GOT A LITTLE MORE EMOTIONAL IN PHASE TWO
YOU1000000186_S0000052	'VE SEEN YOU ALMOST CHOKE UP TALKING ABOUT YOUR DAD ABOUT HOW YOUR WIFE MOTIVATED YOU HOW YOUR DAD'S YOUR HERO AND HOW ALL THIS MEANS A LITTLE MORE TO YOUR HEART THAN YOUR HEAD
YOU1000000186_S0000053	SO WHAT MOTIVATED YOU TO MAKE THIS CHANGE
YOU1000000186_S0000055	THINK IT'S VERY SIMILAR I I LOVED MY CAREER IN SOFTWARE AND BEING PART OF BUILDING MICROSOFT THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY THE INTERNET
YOU1000000186_S0000056	N MY TWENTY S AND THIRTY S I WAS FANATICAL
YOU1000000186_S0000057	
YOU1000000186_S0000058	AND I SAW WHAT INNOVATION COULD DO
YOU1000000186_S0000059	BUT THERE CAME A POINT WHERE I THOUGHT HEY I SHOULD TURN THAT WORK OVER TO OTHER PEOPLE
YOU1000000186_S0000060	AND THINK ABOUT HOW INNOVATION DOESN'T NATURALLY BENEFIT EVERYONE IT DOESN'T REACH DOWN TO THE POREST IN FACT I'D GOTTEN A CHANCE TO SEE SOME OF THAT AS I TRAVELED THE WORLD
YOU1000000186_S0000061	AND AS A BIG BELIEVER IN INNOVATION I THOUGHT OKAY WE WE CAN PUSH IT IN THAT DIRECTION
YOU1000000186_S0000062	AND SO IT'S ALLOWED ME TO LEARN A LOT OF NEW THINGS
YOU1000000186_S0000063	AND I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO IT EXCEPT FOR THE THE LOCK THE VISIBILITY THE RESOURCES THAT CAME FROM THAT FIRST CAREER
YOU1000000186_S0000064	AND I ACTUALLY USE A LOT OF WHAT I LEARNED THEN IN TERMS OF ENGAGING SCIENTISTS AND DRIVING INNOVATION AS FAST AS WE CAN
YOU1000000186_S0000065	AND HOW IMPORTANT WAS YOUR WIFE IN IN THIS CHAPTER TWO OF YOUR LIFE
YOU1000000186_S0000067	WHEN I FIRST SAID TO MY WIFE THAT I WAS CONSIDERING RETIRING FROM MY FULL TIME WORK AT MICROSOFT
YOU1000000186_S0000069	YOU CRAZY

YOU1000000186_S0000073

YOU1000000186_S0000087	TO DONATE A LOT TO HAVE BE PHILANTHROPHIC AND DONATE TO HIS ORGANIZATION OR TO OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AND TO DO MAKE CHANGE

YOU1000000186_S0000094	AND CERTAINLY I FEEL THAT I MEAN I DO BELIEVE THAT IN INDIA THERE IS A LOT OF PHILANTHROPY
YOU1000000186_S0000095	
YOU1000000186_S0000097	HUGE AMOUNTS THAT WE OFTEN DONATE BUT IT'S USUALLY TO RELIGIOUS
YOU1000000186_S0000098	
YOU1000000186_S0000099	ORGANIZATIONS WE DONATE A LOT TO RELIGION
YOU1000000186_S0000100	E

YOU1000000186_S0000105	E
YOU1000000186_S0000106	DONATE HUGE AMOUNTS BUT THEY GO INTO RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS WHEREAS WE DON'T DONATE YOU KNOW INTO EDUCATION OR INTO HEALTH CARE
YOU1000000186_S0000108	AND I PERSONALLY FEEL THAT IF YOU IF YOU YOU KNOW DONATE INTO EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE
YOU1000000186_S0000110	THE GOD UP THEREIS GOING TO BE REALLY HAPPY
YOU1000000186_S0000112	RBABLY BE HAPPIER SO I MEAN I THINK THAT I THINK IT'S TIME THAT THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE WELL OFF FINANCIALLY IN INDIA AND WHO WOULD LIKE TO CONTRIBUTE TO NATION BUILDING
YOU1000000186_S0000113	E
YOU1000000186_S0000114	BUILDING THIS NATION INTO WHAT IT CAN BE AND TO TRYING TO ACHIEVE ITS FULL POTENTIAL FOR THE YOUTH FOR THE KIDS OF OUR COUNTRY
YOU1000000186_S0000115	AND FOR THE FOR THE YOU KNOW THE EMOTIONAL HAPPINESS FOR ALL OF US THEN THAT IS ONE ONE AREA THAT WE CAN REALLY HELP IN
YOU1000000186_S0000116	DO YOU THINK IS IN T' KNO
YOU1000000186_S0000117	NIN DONATING HUGE SUMS INTO EDUCATION HEALTH CARE AND OTHER SUCH THINGS
YOU1000000186_S0000119	RATHER THAN JUST RELIGION
YOU1000000186_S0000120	YEAH DO YOU THINK LIKE YOU NED TWO HANDS TO CLAP IT'S A BIT OF A FAILURE ON THE THE LACK OF INSTITUTIONS THAT THEY CAN FEEL SAFE THAT THE MONEY'S GONE TO THE RIGHT PLACE
YOU1000000186_S0000121	I IF YOU DONATE TO THE PRIME MINISTER'S RELIEF FUND YOU JUST FEEL GOD KNOWS WHAT'LL HAPPEN WHERE IT'LL GO PART OF THE BUDGET
YOU1000000186_S0000122	BUT IF YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING AN INDIAN EQUIVALENT OF THE GATES FOUNDATION OR SOMETHING WHERE YOU KNOW
YOU1000000186_S0000123	I SPEND THE MONEY HERE IT'S NOT GOING TO GO TOO MUCH TO SALARIES IT'S GOING TO GO TARGETED
YOU1000000186_S0000124	DON'T AGREE WITH THAT ENTIRELY
YOU1000000186_S0000126	BECAUSE I FEEL THAT WHILE YES WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT YOU KNOW WHERE ARE WE PUTTING OUR MONY
YOU1000000186_S0000127	WHERE ARE WE DON IN TICKET THAT'S A CONCERN WHICH ALL OF US SHOULD HAVE CERTAINLY BUT I DON'T THINK THAT YOU WON'T FIND ANY INSTITUTION O
YOU1000000186_S0000129	YOU YOU WILL IF YOU REALLY ARE INTERESTED I DON'T THINK IT'S
YOU1000000186_S0000131	THAT'S NOT A SUFFICIENT EXCUSE AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED
YOU1000000186_S0000132	SO BILL GATES WHEN YOU MEET INDIAN ENTREPRENEURS BILLIONAIRES ARE YOU GETTING ANY TRACTION WITH THEM THAT THEY SHOULD ALSO DONATE AND DO THI SECOND MIRACLE A MIRACLE OF SAY VACCINES
YOU1000000186_S0000133	L I'M SURE THAT PHILANTHROPY IN INDIA WILL CONTINUE TO GROW
YOU1000000186_S0000134	I THINK THERE'S AN AWARENESS THAT ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT CAN DO A LOT THAT THERE 'RE SOME THINGS THAT ARE INNOVATIVE
YOU1000000186_S0000135	WHETHER IT'S GOOD SCHOOLS SHOWING THE WAY ON THAT TERE'SE PEOPLE
YOU1000000186_S0000137	WI THINK DO AN AMAZING JOB AND I'M SURE THERE'S OTHERS OUT THERE LIKE THAT
YOU1000000186_S0000138	IN AGRICULTURE THE
YOU1000000186_S0000140	YOUNOW GETTING SMART YOUNG PEOPLE GETTING OUT THERE PUSHING INNOVATIVE TECHNIQUES
YOU1000000186_S0000141	AND SO YES PHILANTHROPY'S GOING TO GROW THE ONLY THING I DO IS I AS PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN PHILANTHROPY II SHARE WITH THEM HOW MUCH FUN IT CAN BE
YOU1000000186_S0000142	AND TALK THM ABOUT THE FACT THAT AS YOU MOVE FROM THE PLACE THAT YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL USUALLY IN BUSINESS YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE
YOU1000000186_S0000143	BECAUSE YOU'RE GOINGTO BE IN AN AREA WHERE THE MEASURES ARE NOT AS CLEAR
YOU1000000186_S0000144	AND YOU HAVEN'T HAD THE TWENTY OR THIRTY YEAR PERIOD OF EXPERIENCE WHERE YOU'RE REALLY FAMILIAR WITH THE TERRITORY
YOU1000000186_S0000145	YOU WILL HAVE TO ENGAGE WITH THE GOVERNMENT AT LEAST TO SHOW THE WAY ON CERTAIN ISSUES SO IT IT'S TRICKY
YOU1000000186_S0000146	I THINK ONE OF THE EARLIEST PHILANTHROPIS ANYWHERE WAS THE TATA FAMILY
YOU1000000186_S0000147	THEY WERE ACTUALLY A FEW TEARES YEAH TATES EVEN BEFORE ROCKEFELER AND AND CARNEGY
YOU1000000186_S0000148	AND I LEARNED A LOT FROM THOSE EARLY FOUNDATIONS BECAUSE THEY WERE PRETTY BRILLIANT IN WHAT THEY DID
YOU1000000186_S0000149	E
YOU1000000186_S0000150	AND I THINK THE MORE PEOPLE GIVE THE MORE S AND PREMGIES THERE ARE THE MORE IT MAKES OTHER PEOPLE THINK OKAY SHOULD I DO THE SAME
YOU1000000186_S0000151	AND SO I HOPE
YOU1000000186_S0000153	THAT TEN YEARS NOW WE CAN SAY THAT THIS WAS THE GOLDEN ERA OF O PHILANTHROPY IN INDIA AND THE REST OF THE WORLD
YOU1000000186_S0000154	YOU DO FIND SOME TRACTION WHEN YOU TALK TO THEM
YOU1000000186_S0000155	ABSOLUTELY THE INTEREST IN DISCUSSION IS IS VERY STRONG IN FACT THERE'VE BEEN A NUMBER OF MEETINGS AND PEOPLE ARE FINDING THEIR WAY
YOU1000000186_S0000156	THAT BOUNDARY OF HOW YOU CONNECT AND YOU KNOW SHOW MODELS FOR THE GOVERNMENT THAT'S TAKEN SOME CAPACITY BUILDING IS TAKING PLACE
YOU1000000186_S0000157	THE US IS IN THIS RESPECT FURTHER DOWN THE LEARNING CURVE THERE'S NO LACK OF PLACES TO GIVE
YOU1000000186_S0000158	AND TO SOME DEGREE THETHE UNIVERSITIES HAVE TO REACH OUT A LITTLE MORE AND SAY OKAY HERE'S A PROGRAM THAT YOU COULD FUND
YOU1000000186_S0000159	AND THEY SHOULD LOOK AT HOW THAT'S HAPPENED IN THE U S WHICH IS
YOU1000000186_S0000161	VERY ORGANIZED BEAUTIFULLY ORGANIZED UNIVERSITIES OF AMERICA
YOU1000000187_S0000001	SO WHEN I WAS TEACHING THIS WAS ONE OF THE TESTS I WILL I WILL ASK YOU KNOW HOW YOU KNOW YOU'RE AN ARTIST THAT'S THE MAIN QUESTION AND YOU KNOW
YOU1000000187_S0000002	TO KNOW AN ARTIST OR NOT IS LIKE A BREATHING YOU DON'T QUESTION BREATHING YOU HAVE TO BREATH OTHERWISE YOU JUST DIE SO YOU BREATHE SO IF YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING
YOU1000000187_S0000003	AND YOU HAVE SOME IDEAS AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE THEM AND THIT'S BECOME LIKE A KIND OF ALMOST OBSESSION AND YOU HAVE TO CREATE AND YOU HAVE THIS URGE TO CREATE YOU'RE DEFINITELY AN ARTIST
YOU1000000187_S0000004	BUT YOU'RE NOT A GREAT ARTIST YOU'RE JUST AN ARTIST TO BE GREAT ARTIST THAT'S ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF RULES AND AND YOU REALLY HAVE TO
YOU1000000187_S0000005	HAVE TO KIND OF IT'S LIKE A IT'S LIKE RE OBSESSED YOU IT'S LIKE IT'S LIKE I'S NOTHING ELSE IN YOUR MIND
YOU1000000187_S0000006	THE ONLY ADVICE YOU EVER HEAR IS SOMETHING YOU ALREADY KNOW AND IT JUST GETS CONFIRMED IF YOU THINK OF ALL THE ADVICE THAT YOU'VE HEARD FIFTY MILLION PIECES OF ADVICE PEOPLE
YOU1000000187_S0000007	AND THERE MAY BE THREE OR FOUR PIECES OF ADVICE YOU CAN THINK OF HAVING TAKEN
YOU1000000187_S0000008	WHEN I WAS REALLY YOUNG WILLIAM BURROUWS TOLD ME I WAS REALLY STRUGGLING WE NEVER HAD ANY MONEY AND
YOU1000000187_S0000009	AND WILLIAM THE ADVICE THAT WILLIAM GAVE ME WAS BUILD A GOOD NAME YOU KNOW KEEP YOUR NAME CLEAN
YOU1000000187_S0000010	DON'T MAKE COMPROMISES DON'T WORRY ABOUT MAKING A BUNCH OF MONEY OR BEING SUCCESSFUL BE CONCERNED WITH DOING GOOD WORK
YOU1000000187_S0000011	AND MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICES AND PROTECT YOUR WORK AND IF YOU BUILD A GOOD NAME EVENTUALLY YOU KNOW THAT NAME WILL BE ITS OWN CURRENCY
YOU1000000187_S0000012	THE ONLY ADVICE I HAVE IS PROBABLY THINGS THAT A LOT OF YOUNG MUSICIANS AND ARTISTS ALREADY KNOW THAT
YOU1000000187_S0000014	LTHOUGH SOME OF THEM MAY HAVE THE AMBITION TO BE THE NEXT THE NEXT J Z OR THE NEXT WHATEVER
YOU1000000187_S0000015	WHATEVER IT IS THE NUMBER OF THOSE ARTISTS ARE VERY VERY SMALL
YOU1000000187_S0000017	AND OFTEN THE ARTISTS WHO ARE VERY SUCCESSFUL THAT WAY
YOU1000000187_S0000019	THEY
YOU1000000187_S0000021	THEY DON'T HAVE MUCH FLEXIBILITY THEY IN IN ACHIEVING SUCCESS THEY KIND OF LOSE A LOT OF THEIR CREATIVE FREEDOM
YOU1000000187_S0000022	THEY HAVE TO KEEP MAKING THE SAME THING MORE ORLESS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND THAT IF THE MUSICIAN OR ARTIST VALUES THEIR FREEDOM AND
YOU1000000187_S0000023	THE ABILITY TO BE CREATIVE THEN THEY HAVE TO MAYBE REALIZE THAT THEY WON'T BE MAKING
YOU1000000187_S0000025	HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THEY MIGHT BE MAKING LESS MONEY BUT THEY MIGHT HAVE MORE AUTISTIC SATISFACTION
YOU1000000187_S0000027	PAINTER PHOTOGRAPHER FILMMAKER VIDEO ARTIST WHATEVER YOU DO
YOU1000000187_S0000029	NOBODY ELSE CAN DO THAT BETTER THAN
YOU1000000187_S0000031	ITHINK YOU KNOW THE THING IS IS WE'RE NOT IN YOU KNOW WE CAN'T IMPART ANY KIND OF WISDOM TO ANYONE ELSE WE'RE SO IMMERSED IN THE BULLSHIT OF OUR OWN ACTIVITIES TO
YOU1000000187_S0000032	TO KNOW EVEN HOW TO GIVE ANYONE ADVICE SO
YOU1000000187_S0000034	MY ADVICE TO YOUNGER ARTISTS WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE
YOU1000000187_S0000036	TO BE VERY SENSITIVE TO WHERE THEY ARE IN WHAT TIMES IN WHAT PART OF THE WORLD AND HOW THAT
YOU1000000187_S0000038	CONSTITUTES THE ARTISTIC PRACTICE THE ARTISTIC INQUIRY
YOU1000000187_S0000040	I THINK THE GREAT ARTISTS HAVE TO BE READY TO FAIL WHICH IS NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE DO BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE SUCCESS
YOU1000000187_S0000041	IN A CERTAIN WAY THEN THE PUBLIC ACCEPT YOU IN A CERTAIN WAY YOU START SOMEHOW INVOLUNTARLY REPRODUCING THE SAME IMAGES THE SAME TYPE OF WORK

YOU1000000189_S0000077	SO WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU GET ACCELERATED GROWTH BECAUSE THE ROOTS CAN GET A LOT OF OXYGEN
YOU1000000189_S0000079	SINCE THERE'S NO SOIL THERE'S NO WEEDS WHICH IS AMAZING BECAUSE POOLING WEEDS IS LITERALLY THE WORST WEEKEND ACTIVITY EVER
YOU1000000189_S0000080	VERTICAL FARMING IT'S JUST YOUR HEAD OF LETTUCE OR YOUR CAL OR YOUR SPINNAGE OR YOUR BERRIES OR YOUR TOMATOES NO BUGS NO WEEDS
YOU1000000189_S0000081	WHAT IS THE ACTUAL BENEFIT OF HAVING A VERTICAL FARM VERSUS HAVING A NORMAL FARM THAT WE'RE USED T
YOU1000000189_S0000082	BIG PART OF IT IS WITH THE VERTICAL FARM WE'RE REALLY SAVING ON SPACE WE CAN USE NINETY PERCENT LESS LAND BUT WE CAN GROW NINETY PERCENT MORE FOOD
YOU1000000189_S0000083	WHEN YOU GO VERTICAL LIKE THIS THIS IS ONE TENTH OF AN ACRE WE CAN GROW TEN TIMES MORE FOOD AS A RESULT OF GOING VERTICAL
YOU1000000189_S0000084	PLUS OUR RESOURCES WE USE NINETY TO NINETYEIGHT PERCENT LESS WATER THAT'S HUGE YEAH I MEAN WHAT THREE PERCENT OF THE WATER IN THE IN THE WORLD IS FRESH WATER
YOU1000000189_S0000085	SO IT'S NOT JUST A COMMODITY HEREIN THE UNITED STATES BUT ALL OVER THE WORLD HAVING FRESH WATER SO WE GOTTO REALLY CONSERVE OUR RESOURCES AND IF WE DON'T
YOU1000000189_S0000086	WE'RE SETTING OURSELVES UP FOR MAJOR CATASTROPHE
YOU1000000189_S0000087	HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU THINK YOU COULD FEED LIKE JUST OUT OF THIS SPACE
YOU1000000189_S0000088	OUT OF THIS SPACE WE COULD EASILY SFEED GOSH HUNDRED FAMILIES ON A WEEKLY BASIS
YOU1000000189_S0000089	WOW AS WE ALL NOW OUR WORLD IS CHANGING THE LAND AVAILABLE TO US IS CHANGING THE QUALITY SOIL THAT WE HAVE ON OUR EARTH IS CHANGING
YOU1000000189_S0000090	AND THIS MAY BE THE MOST SUSTAINABLE WAY TO FEED OUR COMMUNITIES MOVING FORWARD IF SOMEONE WATCHED THIS VIDEO AND WANTED TO START GARDENING TOMORROW OR TODAY
YOU1000000189_S0000091	WHAT WOULD BE LIKE YOUR TOP THREE TIPS FOR DOING THAT
YOU1000000189_S0000092	GROW THE THINGS YOU' LOVE TO EAT KEEP IT SIMPLE USE CLEAN WATER USE GOOD QUALITY SEEDLINGS WE'VE GOT RESIDENTIAL MODELS
YOU1000000189_S0000093	AS WELL AS COMMERCIAL FARMS
YOU1000000189_S0000094	SIDENTIAL MODEL
YOU1000000189_S0000095	SO THE RESIDENTIAL MODEL'S ABOUT FIVE OR SIX FEET TALL JUST LIKE YOU ARE AND ONE TO TWO TOWERS COULD EASILY FEED A FAMILY OF FOUR DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU'RE GROWING
YOU1000000189_S0000096	YOU'RE GONNA BE EXPOSED TO LESS CHEMICALS YOU'LL LOVE IT YOU'LL REALLY LOVE IT
YOU1000000189_S0000097	I WAS A SKEPTIC I ABSOLUTELY THOUGHT THE BIOLOGY OF THIS FOOD MUST BE DIFFERENT IF WE'RE NOT MAKING IT WITH SOIL AND THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER
YOU1000000189_S0000098	THE SAME AMOUNT OF SUNLIGHT AS THE VEGETABLES AND FRUITS WE'RE USED TO BUT THE MATTER OF THE FACT IS IT'S BETTER IT'S GOT MORE NUTRIENTS MORE MINERALS
YOU1000000189_S0000099	IT'S MORE DENSE IN THE RICH VITAMINS THAT YOUR BODY NEEDS AND IT'S JUST MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY
YOU1000000189_S0000100	OU KNOW AS A COMPOUNG PHARMACIST I DO CONSULTS AND I GOT INTO THIS BECAUSE I REALLY SAW NOT JUST MY OWN KIDS BUT MY OWN PATIENTS THAT WERE MISSIN THE FOOD PART
YOU1000000189_S0000101	THEY WERE MISSING THAT NUTRITION PART AND AS I CORRECTED NUTRITION IN THEM I'M LIKE OMY THIS CHANGED THEIR WHOLE LIFE
YOU1000000189_S0000102	YOU WERE TAUGHT IN PHARMACY SCHOOL JUST GIVE A DRUG GIVE A DRUG GIVE A DRUG DRUGS ARE JUST BANDATES THEY DON'T CURE US IF IF YOU DON'T HAVE GOOD NUTRITION
YOU1000000189_S0000103	THAT FOUNDATION THAT WE'RE BUILDING OUR BODY ON ISN'T THERE AND SO THAT LEADS TO ALL SORTS OF THINGS YOU NOW DEPRESSION LEAKY GUT YNOW GUM DISEASE
YOU1000000189_S0000104	PEOPLE THAT ARE CONSTANTLY HAVING HEADACHES AN THEY'RE NOT GROWING PROPERLY OUR KIDS DON'T GROW PROPERLY BECAUSE OF NUTRITION SO STARTS WITH GOOD FOUNDATION
YOU1000000189_S0000105	IF YOU HAVE A GOOD GOOD FOUNDATION WITH NUTRITION EAT IT WHINCH YOU GROW OR BUY IT LOCALLY YOU'RE GOINGNA BE WAY HEALTHIER
YOU1000000189_S0000106	O CRAZY HOW YOUR DIET CAN AFFECT PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING IT'S HARD TO PUT INTO A SENTENCE HOW COOL AND INTERESTING I THOUGHT THIS WHOLE EXPERIENCE WAS
YOU1000000189_S0000107	I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A FIRM BELIEVER IN WHAT YOU PUT IN YOUR BODY MATTERS AND THE FOOD YOU PUT IN YOUR BODY MATTERS
YOU1000000189_S0000108	AND WE ARE ALLOWING FOOD INDUSTRIES TO SPRAY IT WITH PESTICIDES TO TRANSPORT IT SUPER FAR CHANGE ITS ENZYMES AND NUTRITIONAL BENEFITS
YOU1000000189_S0000109	SO THAT WHEN WE'RE RECEIVING THE FOOD IT'S NOT EVEN GIVING US THE FUEL THAT WE NEED TO SURVIVE IN A HEALTHY WAY
YOU1000000189_S0000110	THE BODY IS AN INCREDIBLE PIECE OF EQUIPMENT MACHINERY YOU PUT GOOD STUFF IN IT GIVES GOOD STUFF OUT IF YOU PUT BAD STUFF IN IN TIME BAD STUFF'S GONGNA COME OUT
YOU1000000189_S0000111	BUT YOU CAN CORRECT IT IT JUST TAKES SOME SOME EFFORT ON OUR PART TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT WHO SAID THAT HIPOCRATES YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT LET FOOD BE MEDICINE LET MEDICINE BE FOOD
YOU1000000189_S0000112	HE SAID IT A LOT MORE ELOQUENTLY BUT I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT
YOU1000000189_S0000113	TRUE GARDEN WAS QUITE POSSIBLY ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THINGS I'VE EVER SEEN IT WAS PRISTINE IT WAS GREEN
YOU1000000189_S0000114	NOT FAKE GREEN NOT SPRAYED ON GREEN IT WAS BEAUTIFUL VIBRANT GREEN
YOU1000000189_S0000115	AND THE OXYGEN IN THAT GREEN HOUSE I WOULD LIKE TO ONE DAY LIVE IN A GREENHOUSE WITH THAT PURE OXYGEN
