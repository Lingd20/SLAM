POD1000000019_S0000159	MADE FROM HER OLD SESSIONS WITH HIM NOW THAT JEANY'S GOT THE BIGGEST HIT IN THE NATION THESE RECORDS WILL SELL
POD1000000019_S0000161	BLACKMAN'S GOT A MANILLA ENVELOPE LIKE YOU SEE IN EVERY MOVIE ABOUT A PRIVATE DETECTIVE AND HE WANTS TO GIVE IT TO JEANY BUT FIRST SHE'S GOT TO SIGN A NEW PIECE OF PAPER SAYING SHE WON'T SUE HIM FOR RELEASING HER OLD RECORDINGS
POD1000000019_S0000170	WHICH IS ALSO THE EXPLANATION FOR WHY JEANY WOULD BE IN LAS VEGAS OPENING UP FOR JOHNNY PAYCHECK WHEN ALL SHE'S SUPPOSEDLY DONE IS ONE BARELY RELEASED SINGLE FOR BLACKROSE RECORDS
POD1000000019_S0000184	SOMETHING PHYSICAL FOR JENY TO PLAY PRETEND WITH TO KEEP THE WHOLE CHARADE GOING IT WAS CALLED YOU WRITE THE MUSIC CREDITED TO GEN RIHLEY QUOTE UNQUOTE RELEASED ON LITTLE DARLIN RECORDS IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN
POD1000000019_S0000188	NOW HERE ARE THE TWO BIG QUESTIONS I DON'T THINK I CAN OR SHOULD EVEN TRY TO ANSWER DID AUBREY MAHU AND JENEY C RILLY HAVE AN AFFAIR
POD1000000019_S0000201	SHE GETS TO PICK WILD MOUNTAIN BERRIES WITH GLENN CAMPBELL ON TV
POD1000000019_S0000208	IF YOU'RE STARTING TO GET THE IDEA THAT JEANE'S ALWAYS THOUGHT OF AS LITTLE MORE THAN A PUPPET FOR THE PEOPLE BEHIND THE SCENES OF HER CAREER I WOULD SAY THAT SEEMS ACCURATE
POD1000000019_S0000213	AND WHILE THE SONG IS ACTUALLY SUNG BY THE DAUGHTER CHARACTER WHO DOESN'T DRESS THAT WAY EVERY TIME YOU SEE JEANYE C RILY SHE LOOKS LIKE MRS JOHNSON
POD1000000019_S0000228	FROM THE NIGHTMARE SHE DESCRIBES YOU'D EXPECT THAT TO BE THE ONLY TIME SHE EVER TOKED UP BUT THIS VIDEO CLIP OF RALPH EMMERY INTERVIEWING HER SEEMS TO SUGGEST OTHERWISE
POD1000000019_S0000234	THE ONLY OTHER WOMAN TO DO THAT IN THE NINETEEN HUNDREDS IS DOLLYE PARTON WITH NINE TO FIVE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE MAKING JENY THE FIRST WOMAN TO EVER DO IT IF YOU DON'T COUNT THE FARCE WITH LITTLE DARLIN RECORDS
POD1000000019_S0000252	HERE'S HER DOING IT ON THE JOHNNY CASH SHOW
POD1000000019_S0000261	LIKE THE ELLAY TIMES POP CRITIC ROBERT HILBURN WHO REVIEWED A GN C RILEY CONCERT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE UNDER THE HEADLINE LITTLE TALENT
POD1000000019_S0000268	SHE ALWAYS HAD A CRACK BAND BEHIND HER THE HARPER VALLEY EXPRESS THEY USUALLY MADE THE TEMPO OF EVERYTHING FASTER TO REALLY PUT SOME GAS IN THE TANK AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO DENY JENY'S CHARISMA AS A PERFORMER
POD1000000019_S0000274	NOT ONLY WAS JENY NOT A ONE-HIT WONDER SHE MADE GOOD ALBUMS WITH VERY LITTLE FILLER CHECK OUT THIS ALBUM TRACK FROM NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO NEVER EVEN RELEASED AS A SINGLE CALLED WITHOUT YOU
POD1000000019_S0000277	WITHOUT YOU IS FROM JENIY'S SECOND ALBUM ON MGM AFTER LEAVING PLANTATION RECORDS IN NINETEN SEVENTY TWO IN WHAT SHELBEY SINGLETON CALLED A BREACH OF CONTRACT
POD1000000019_S0000291	AKA THE EXACT OPPOSITE AUDIENCE OF THE ONLY REASON ANYONE KNOWS JEANY C RILEY'S NAME HARPER VALLEY PT A A SONG HIGHLY CRITICAL OF HYPOCRISY IN SOCIAL GROUPS WITH HARD CORE CONSERVATIVE VALUES
POD1000000019_S0000301	NEXT MOVE ASK TOM T HALL TO WRITE ANOTHER HARPER VALLEY PTA A THING HE'D BEEN VERY VOCAL ABOUT HIS RELUCTANCE TO DO BUT ALSO HE'S A BIG SOFTY
POD1000000019_S0000355	AND THAT DISCLAIMER IS WRITTEN BY JENIY'S CO-AUTHOR WHO I ALSO FAILED TO MENTION IS A PREACHER HERE'S WHAT HE WRITES QUOTE TO KEEP FROM HURTING SOME OF THE FOLKS JEANYE LOVES WE HAVE CHANGED THE NAMES OF SEVERAL PEOPLE IN THE BOOK
POD1000000019_S0000374	ONE THING THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING THAT WE HEARD TODAY IS UNLIKE AS YOU HEARD IN THE SECOND EPISODE OF THE PODCAST LARETTA LYND'S RECORDING OF THE PILL
POD1000000019_S0000378	I THINK MONEY TALKS I THINK THAT BY THE TIME ANY OF THOSE WOULD BE BUZZ KILLS STARTED PAYING ATTENTION THIS SONG WAS ALREADY THE NUMBER ONE POP SONG IN AMERICA AND IT WENT NUMBER ONE POP BEFORE IT WENT NUMBER ONE COUNTRY
POD1000000019_S0000379	EVERY MAJOR RECORD LABEL IN NASHVILLE HAD BEEN FALLING ALL OVER ITSELF FOR FIFTEEN YEARS TRYING TO DO THAT THEY'D HAVE MADE JEANYE C RILEY THE MAYOR OF NASHVILLE IF SHE DID IT A SECOND TIME
POD1000000019_S0000387	THEN TWO YEARS LATER IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE AS JENY STATED IN THE BOOK THIS IS REALLY AGGRAVATING FOR ME TO HAVE TO TALK ABOUT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THIS IS JUST MY FAULT
POD1000000021_S0000006	THAT'S TRINA EDWARDS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HER HUSBAND EDWIN EDWARDS THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF LOUISIANA
POD1000000021_S0000018	EDWARD SERVED EIGHT YEARS ON CORRUPTION CHARGES
POD1000000021_S0000042	THERE WERE SIX GRAND JURY INVESTIGATIONS DURING EDWARDS'S FIRST TERM
POD1000000021_S0000046	EDWARDS LED LOUISIANA FOR EIGHT YEARS LEAVING OFFICE IN MARCH NINETEN EIGHTY
POD1000000021_S0000047	THE ONLY THING STOPPING HIM FROM BEING GOVERNOR FOR LIFE WERE TERM LIMITS THAT EDWARDS HIMSELF HAD PUSHED FOR
POD1000000021_S0000058	EDWARDS WAS RIGHT TO BELIEVE THAT NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE ELECTION WAS A LOCK HE'D WIN IT WITH SIXTY TWO PERCENT OF THE VOTE
POD1000000021_S0000061	IF THERE'S ONE THING LOUISIANA GOVERNOR ELECT EDWIND EDWARDS KNOWS IT'S HOW TO HAVE A GOOD TIME EVEN WITH A FOUR MILLION DOLLAR CAMPAIGN DEFICIT STARING HIM DOWN
POD1000000021_S0000062	EDWARDS CHARTERED TWO JUMBO JETS ANNOUNCED HE WAS GOING TO PARIS AND INVITED ANYONE WILLING TO CONTRIBUTE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO COME ON ALONG
POD1000000021_S0000096	WHEN I ASKED EDWARDS ABOUT THE CASE HE DIDN'T SOUND ALL THAT SORRY
POD1000000021_S0000111	BUDDY ROMER WAS A CONGRESSMAN FROM NORTH LOUISIANA
POD1000000021_S0000121	THERE WOULD BE NO RUNOFF ROMER WOULD BE THE NEXT GOVERNOR OF LOUISIANA
POD1000000021_S0000123	BUT THAT'S NOT HOW EDWARD SAW IT DROPPING OUT OF THE RACE THAT WAS THE FIRST STEP IN HIS COMEBACK PLAN
POD1000000021_S0000133	IN NINETEN NINETY ONE DAVID DUKE WAS AT THE HEIGHT OF HIS POWERS
POD1000000021_S0000137	THIS IS SLOWBERG I'M JOSH LEVINE EPISODE FIVE THE ROAD TO HEL

POD1000000021_S0000161	EDWIN EDWARDS CARRIED ON HUGHIE LONG'S TRADITION OF ECONOMIC POPULISM
POD1000000021_S0000162	LIKE LONG EDWARDS USE MONEY SNATCHED FROM BIG OIL TO BUILD BRIDGES AND HOSPITALS
POD1000000021_S0000167	IN REALITY DUKE'S BRAND OF POPULISM HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH SHRINKING GOVERNMENT
POD1000000021_S0000169	DUKE'S MESSAGE THE JOURNALIST JOHN MCGINNISS WROTE HELD A LOT OF APPEAL FOR THE CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN OF HUGHE LONG'S OLD VOTERS
POD1000000021_S0000172	THEY WANT TO SEE WHERE YOUYLONG WAS SHOT AND WHERE DAVID DUKE SITS
POD1000000021_S0000181	ROMER'S BIG INITIATIVE WAS A PLAN TO MODERNIZE THE STATE'S APPROACH TO TAXATION
POD1000000021_S0000184	ROMER WAS ADIMANT THAT HIS FISCAL REFORM PLAN WAS NOT A TAX INCREASE
POD1000000021_S0000187	DAVID DUKE THEN A NEWLY ELECTED STATE LEGISLATOR WAS ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S MOST OUTSPOKEN CRITICS
POD1000000021_S0000197	DIGGING LOUISIANA'S ALREADY TROUBLED ECONOMY EVER DEEPER IN DEBT AND FORCING REFORM-MINDED GOVERNOR BUDDY ROMER TO SCRAMBLE HIS WAY OUT OF A NEW FINANCIAL CRISIS
POD1000000021_S0000206	BUT STRATHER WHO'D HELPED ROMER WIN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WAS AVAILABLE TO WORK ON THE GOVERNOR'S REELECTION CAMPAIGN
POD1000000021_S0000219	ROMER ACTUALLY LIKED THE RUBBER BAND IDEA
POD1000000021_S0000225	IN HIS STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS ROMER APOLOGIZED TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR HIS INFLEXIBILITY AND INSENSITIVITY
POD1000000021_S0000228	FOR STRATHER THE SELF-HELP STUFF WAS BAD BUT WHAT HAPPENED NEXT WAS WORSE
POD1000000021_S0000231	I SAW MAR MATELIN A WHOLE BUNCH OF HIGH ESHLON REPUBLICANS SITTING AROUND A TABLE BY THE DINING-ROOM TABLE WITH BUDDY
POD1000000021_S0000242	IDEOLOGY ASIDE ROMER THOUGHT THE MOVE WAS SMART STRATEGY
POD1000000021_S0000243	EDWIN EDWARDS WAS GOING TO GRAB VOTES FROM HIS LEFT NO MATTER WHAT
POD1000000021_S0000244	ROMER FIGURED THAT BRANDING HIMSELF A REPUBLICAN WOULD HELP STAVE OFF RIGHT-WING CHALLENGERS WHO MIGHT THREATEN HIS REELECTION
POD1000000021_S0000245	THE STATEWIDE POLL SHOWED THAT THE TOP THREE CANDIDATES ERE DUKE EDWARDS AND MYSELF
POD1000000021_S0000250	DEMOCRATS IN LOUISIANA FELT BURNED BY ROMER AND REPUBLICANS INCLUDING STATE PARTY OFFICIALS WEREN'T SURE THEY COULD TRUST HIM EITHER
POD1000000021_S0000252	RESENTED THAT ROMER HADN'T INCLUDED HIM IN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE PARTY SWITCH AND ROMER FORGETTING THE LESSONS OF ALL I EVER NEEDED TO KNOW I LEARNED IN KINDERGARTEN CURSED OUT NONGESSER RATHER THAN TRYING TO APPEASE HIM
POD1000000021_S0000254	THAT ENDORSEMENT WOULDN'T GO TO BUDDY ROMER OR DAVID DUKE
POD1000000021_S0000260	THEN DUKE WAS EGGING THEM ON YOU KNOW TO DISRUPT THINGS
POD1000000021_S0000263	BUDDY ROMER HAD TRIED TO CONSOLIDATE THE CONSERVATIVE
POD1000000021_S0000296	BY NINETEEN NINETY ONE THE OPEN PRIMARY WAS OPEN IN A WAY EDWARDS MAYBE HADN'T ANTICIPATED
POD1000000021_S0000305	DUKE COULD PASS THE BUCKET WITH IMPUNITY DURING HIS NINETEEN NINETY SENATE CAMPAIGN BECAUSE THAT WAS A FEDERAL RACE
POD1000000021_S0000307	HAMSTRUNG BY THESE NEW RULES DUKE HELD FEWER RALLIES AS A CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR THAN WHEN HE RAN FOR THE SENATE AND EDWARDS'S FUNDRAISING SLOWED TO A TRICKLE
POD1000000021_S0000312	RAYMOND STRATHER SAW IT UP CLOSE DURING THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN RACE
POD1000000021_S0000326	THE PROBLEM FOR ROMER WAS THAT A LOT OF SWING VOTERS FELT DRAWN TO ANOTHER CANDIDATE

YOU1000000019_S0000002	THE CUBE WAS DESIGNED BY CI MOFANGI AND WAS APPROVED BY MATS VOLK OF COURSE THE CUBE IS HIS MAIN BUT LET'S SEE HOW THE CUBE ACTUALLY PERFORMS AND WHETHER IT'S RIGHT FOR YOU
YOU1000000021_S0000004	THE DMW IS A CONTINUOUSLY SPINNING SLOT MACHINE SYSTEM THAT CONFERS VARIOUS BONUSES EFFECTS AND ATTACKS BASED ON THE RESULTS INCLUDING HOW SACK LEVELS UP
YOU1000000021_S0000007	THE GAME BEGINS WITH ZACH FAIR SOLDIERS SECOND CLASS AD THE GROUP CALLED SOLDIER A PRIVATE MILITARY ARMY OWNED BY THE CHENRA ELECTRIC POWER COMPANY IN THE CITY OF MIDGAR
YOU1000000021_S0000009	ZACH HAS TREMENDOUS SKILLS AND TALENT BUT IS UNFORTUNATELY A LITTLE OVERCONFIDENT AD RECKLESS AT TIMES AS POINTED OUT BY HIS FELLOW SOLDIER ANOTHER FIRST CLASS NAMED SEFAROFF
YOU1000000021_S0000011	ANJIL HELPS HIM OUT REMINDING HIM TO TEMPER HIS ASPIRATIONS WITH PASSIONATE DREAMS AND STEADFAST HONOR
YOU1000000021_S0000012	ZACH HEARS FROM A FELLOW SOLDIER OF THE MASS DESERTION OF TROOPS IN SOLDIER AND HE'S SOON CALLED IN TO SPEAK WITH TE DIRECTOR OF SOLDIER A MANLEN ESARD
YOU1000000021_S0000019	SUDDENLY ANGIL GO'S MISSING AND SEFROT SUSPECTS HE TOO HAS BETRAYED THEM AND DESERTED THOUGH ZACH FERVENTLY DENIES IT
YOU1000000021_S0000020	AFTER THE MISSION DIRECTOR LAZARD CONFIRMS ANGIL REALLY IS GONE FOR UNKNOWN REASONS BUT ASSIGNS ZAC ON A NEW MISSION
YOU1000000021_S0000027	FINDING ANJIL'S MOTHER JILLIAN SHE NOTES ZACH IS THE RESTLESS PUPPY ANJILO SPOKE ABOUT AND SHE TELLS HIM GENESIS CAME BY A MONTH AGO WITH AN ARMY OF MINIONS AND PROCEEDED TO START KILLING TOWNSFOLKE
YOU1000000021_S0000045	AS SEPFEROF TALKS MORE WITH ZACK HE ELABORATES MORE HOW AGIAL GENESIS AND HIMSELF WERE CLOSE FRIENDS AND EVEN THOUGH SEPAROF HIMSELF WAS THE COMPANY'S PRIZED WAR HERO GENESUS HIMSELF WANTED SUCH PRESTIGE AS WELL
YOU1000000021_S0000048	SURVEYING THE MONSTER SEFRATH TIZUS'S ADO ARE IN LEAGUE WITH DR HOLLANDER WHICH TIES INTO THE STORY HE JUST TOLD
YOU1000000021_S0000054	HOLLANDER HIMSELF APPEARS SURPRISED TO SEE THEM BUT EXPLAINS ONLY HE CAN STOP GENESIS'S DEGRADATION AFTER WHICH GENESIS HIMSELF APPEARS AND EXPLAINS HOLLANDER WON'T BE CAPTURED
YOU1000000021_S0000063	SHE'S NATURALLY SURPRISED AND ACTUALLY LIKES HIS UNIQUE EYES TO WHICH ACK CONTINUES TO FLIRT SHOWING OFF THE TRADEMARK MOCKO NFUSED EYES OF A SOLDIER
YOU1000000021_S0000069	LATER ZACH GOES TO VISIT ARICH N SONG HALTS HIM TO CALL HIM INTO A MISSION TO MODAOHEI AND GIVES ZACK PAUE WHEN HE SAYS HE ALSO KNOWS ARITH  WON'T ELABORATE
YOU1000000021_S0000072	ZAK IS FROM THE TINY VILLAGE OF GONGAGA AND THIS VILLAGE IS FROM NIMULHEIM WHO INTRODUCES HIMSELF AS CLOUD
YOU1000000021_S0000073	AS THE MISSION FOR HOLLANDER CONTINUES GENESIS MOVES TO KILL HIM AS HE'S ALREADY BEN VISIBLY DEGRADING AND CLAIMS HE DOESN'T NEED HOLLANDER ANYMORE
YOU1000000021_S0000076	N HIS WAY OUT HE IS MET BY ANGIEL AS WELL AS HOLLANDER WHO EXPLAINS THE G AND PROJECT G WAS NOT FOR GENESIS BUT FOR JILIAN WHO WAS ANGILE'S MOTHER WHO APPARENTLY TOOK HER OWN LIFE EARLIER IN VENORA
YOU1000000021_S0000077	EXPERIMENT WAS TWOFOLD JILIAN HAD GANOVAS CELLS INJECTED INTO HER WHILE SHE WAS PREGNANT WITH ANGIL AND GENESIS SIMPLY HAD GENOVA CELLS IMPLANTED DIRECTLY INTO HIM AS A TESTTUBE BABY
YOU1000000021_S0000079	REASON BEING ANDGIEL CAN USE THE GENOVA CELS AS A TWO-WAY CONDUITE AS INTENDED ANDGIL THEN EXPLAINS HIS CELLS CAN ABSORB GENETIC TRAITS AND PASS THEM TO OTHERS BEYOND WHAT GENESIS CAN MANAGE WHICH IS ONLY IMPRINT THEM ON TO OTHERS
YOU1000000021_S0000082	AFTER WINNING A BITTER VICTORY A DEGRADING ANGIE IS GRATEFUL THAT ZACH ENDED HIM WITH DIGNITY AND HONOR BEFORE DYING HE PASSES ON HIS FAMILY SWORD AND LEGACY OF HONOR THE BUSTER SWORD TO ZACH
YOU1000000021_S0000088	SHE TEASES HIM ABOUT HIS GIRLFRIEND ERON AND EXPLAINS SHE'S UNDER CONSTANT TURKS SURVEILLANCE AS IT TURNS OUT SHE IS THE LAST LIVING MEMBER OF A RACE CALLED THE ANCIENT
YOU1000000021_S0000089	ZACH IS SURPRISED NOT ONLY TO LEARN THIS BUT ALSO THAT ERICH NEVER TOLD HIM
YOU1000000021_S0000092	AND SO ZACK'S VACATION IS OVER AS THE THREE OF THEM ARE TO INVESTIGATE ATTACK ON JUAN
YOU1000000021_S0000093	IT TURNS OUT MORE GENESIS CLONES WERE TTACKING AND THIS TIME HOLLANDER WAS EVEN THERE THOUGH HE GETS AWAY ONCE AGAIN
YOU1000000021_S0000095	RETURNING TO ARITH HE FINDS A MONSTER DOG THERE BUT IT'S NOT REALLY CAUSING PROBLEMS THOUGH ZACH NOTES IT'S ALSO AN ANGELIC COPY AND I SEEMS KEEN TO PROTECT ERITH
YOU1000000021_S0000101	AS THEIR MISIONI MENTIONS NOTHING OF THEIR OLD FRIENDS SAFEROV PRIVATELY CONFESSES TO ZAC THAT HE'S SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING LEAVING SCHINERA AS WELL DEPENDING ON WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS MISSION
YOU1000000021_S0000105	AS THEY ARRIVE SAFAROV MAKES SMALL TALK ASKING CLOUD HOW HI FEELS TO BE HOME AGAIN AND TRYING TO RELATE AS HE HAS NO ORIGINAL TOWN AND ALL HE KNOWS IS HIS MOTHER'S NAME TO BE JNOVA WHO DIED AFTER HE WAS BORN
YOU1000000021_S0000106	IN TOWN THEY ARE MET BY A LOCAL TOWN GIRL BY THE NAME OF TIFA
YOU1000000021_S0000107	WHEN TIVA LEARNS HE'S A SOLDIER FIRST CLASS SHE SEEMS SURPRISED BY THE FACT THAT THEY OLAY SEND HIM AND SEFROFF AND BEGINS TO ASK SOMETHING ELSE BUT STOPS AND RUNS OFF INSTEAD
YOU1000000021_S0000117	SAFEOTH COMES T HORRIFYING HYPOTHESIS THAT IT'S POSSIBLE HE WAS CREATED THE SAME WAY AND IT BECOMES A CRISIS OF IDENTITY IRONICALLY IDENTICAL TO HIS FRIENDS GENESIS AND ANGIL
YOU1000000021_S0000128	AFTERWARDS CLOUD WISHES HE WERE STRONG LIKE ZACK BUT ZACH WARNS HIM NOT TO GET TANGLED UP WITH SOLDIER
YOU1000000021_S0000132	I SUDDENLY ON FIRE WITH MANY TOWNSFOLK SLAIN EVEN CLOUD IS BEATEN ONCE AGAIN AND AROUND THE CORNER ASEPAROTH HIMSELF CALMLY STANDING AMIDST THE FLAMES
YOU1000000021_S0000135	ONFRONTING SEPAROV ZACH IS IGNORED A SEFROTH INSISTS HIS MOTHER THE ANCIENT WAS THE SUPERIOR RACE AND THEY SHOULD HAVE RULED THE PLANET
YOU1000000021_S0000137	FINALLY FED UP WITH THE CRIMES OF HUMANS AND SHINNR IN PARTICULAR SAPROTH SEES WHAT ANGIL AN GENESIS KEPT WARNING ABOUT AND CHOOSES TO STAND ALONE
YOU1000000021_S0000152	CLOUD SUCCUMBS TO HIS INJURIES NEXT TO ZACH AND AS THEY BOTH PASS OUT DR HOJO ARRIVES ON THE SCENE AND CHOSES CLO TO BE IS NEXT TEST SUBJECT
YOU1000000021_S0000156	HOWEVER SHINNER LABELS THEM BOTH FUGITIVE SAMPLES SO THEY FIND THEMSELVES NOW RUNNING FROM THE ARMY AND SISNE ACTUALLY MANAGES TO CATCH UP TO THEM FIRST
YOU1000000021_S0000157	HE PLEADS WITH HER TO JUST WALK AWAY AS HE KNOWS IT'S TOLLERER TO ESCAPE THE TURKS BUT SISNA CHOOSES HER DUTY OVER PERSONAL FEELINGS
YOU1000000021_S0000161	HE KNOWS THER ARE HOJO'S LATEST EXPERIMENTS AND MODIFIED VERSIONS OF JANOVA'S POWER RUNS THROUGH BOTH OF THEM
YOU1000000021_S0000171	ALMOST TO MIDGOG ZACH STOPS TO FINALLY CONFRONT THE FAILED AND TORTURED CREATION OF A GENOVA INFUSED HUMAN WHO CONSIDERS ZACH A PERFECT FUSION OF ANGIL'S WILL AND SEFAROS SUPERIOR SELS
YOU1000000021_S0000185	MEANWHILE SONG ORDERS SYSNA AND THE OTHER TURKS TO FIND AND SAVE SACK BEFORE THE ARMY FINDS THEM WHICH SISNE IS VERY MOTIVATED TO DO
YOU1000000021_S0000186	THOUGH THIS IS A NEAR TREASONOUS ACTION SONG IS WILLING TO RISK IT FOR HIS FRIEND AND FOR AA'S SAKE
YOU1000000021_S0000188	UNFORTUNATELY THE ARMY INTERCEPTS ZAC FIRST AND ZACH WILLINGLY CHOOSES TO FIGHT AND HONORABLY PROTECT CLOUD DESPITE HIS OWN DESIRE TO RETURN TO ERIN AND SAVE HIMSELF
YOU1000000021_S0000194	AGAINST ALL ODDS ZAK TRIUMPHS IN HIS FINAL STAND BUT HE IS ON HIS LAST LEGS AS SHINRABENS REINFORCING THEIR TROOPS FIRING COUNTLESS BULLETS INTO A RELENTLESS SACK
YOU1000000021_S0000199	MEANWHILE CLOUD FINALLY WAKES UP AND DRAGS HIMSELF OVER TO SAK WHO IS STILL BARELY ALIVE AND FORCES A SMILE FOR HIM AND URGES CLOUD TO LIVE ON IN INSTEAD AS HIS OWN LIVING LEGACY
YOU1000000021_S0000204	AS THE GAME ENDS THE TRAUMA OF THE EVENTS UNFORTUNATELY RESULTS IN CLOUD BLOCKING ALL MEMORY OF ZACH DESPITE HIS PROMISE
YOU1000000027_S0000009	ALL RIGHT THE NEXT JOURNALING PROMPT IS SOMETHING THAT I LEARNED FROM MY FRIENDS CAJO PANDE THIS PAST SUNDAY ACTUALLY WE DID A LIVE CHAT TOGETHER ON FACEBOOK IF YOU WANTTO WATCH THAT FULL LIVE CHAT IT'S REALLY AMAZING

YOU1000000033_S0000100	AND THEY STARTED SAYING THINGS ABOUT RALPH AND ABOUT HIS LIFE WHICH THEY COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN THAT WERE INDICATIONS OF HOW GOD HAD WORKED IN HIM AND AND WHAT THE LORD WANTED TO DO WITH HIM

YOU1000000128_S0000011	GET US CLOSER TO HOME LET US GET US TO EUROPE AND ONE OF THESE THINGS THAT I'VE SEEN GEORGE DO TIME AND TIME AGAIN IN EUROPE IS SOMETHING THAT ALSSO REALLY CHARACTER AND THAT IS STANDING UP FOR THE UNDERDOG
YOU1000000128_S0000030	THAT'S WHEN IRANIAN GENERAL SOLAMANI WAS ASSASSINATED IN IRAQ
YOU1000000129_S0000008	CARNEGI WAS AT ONE POINT THE RICHEST AMERICAN IN HISTORY BUT HE WASN'T BORN IN AMERICA
YOU1000000129_S0000009	ANDREWS STORY BEGINS ACROSS THE ATLANTIC OCEAN IN DUNFIRMLINE SCOTLAND WHERE HE GREW UP IN WHAT COULD ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS ABJECT POVERTY
YOU1000000129_S0000022	KARNEGI WOULD PROFIT FROM IT HE WAS ABLE TO ESCAPE HARM'S WAY AFTER PAYING EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS FOR A SUBSTITUTE TO TAKE HIS PLACE ON THE BATTLEFIELD IT WAS DURING THIS TIME THAT CARNEGI NOTICED THAT THE WOODEN BRIDGES WERE EASILY BURNT BY THE TROOPS
YOU1000000129_S0000025	OWNING THE IRON SOURCE MEANT THAT KARNIGI'S BRIDGEBUILDING COMPANY WOULD NOT BE DEPENDENT ON MINING OR EXTRACTING COMPANIES FOR IRON LIKE THEIR COMPETITORS THIS NOT ONLY GAVE KARNEGI MORE CONTROL OVER THE ENTIRE PROCESS IT ALSO IMPROVED THEIR MARGINS
YOU1000000129_S0000044	HENRY CLAY FRICK AS A TEAM CARNEGI AND FRICK WERE A POWERFUL FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH AND TO SHOW HOW RUTHLESS THE TWO COULD BE LOOK NO FARTHER THAN THE STORY ABOUT DUCANE WORKS
YOU1000000129_S0000059	IN EIGHTN NINETY EIGHT NINE PERCENT OF ALL STEEL WORKERS INDUSTRY WIDE WOULD DIE ON THE JOB WHEN THE WORKERS REFUSED FRICK AGGRESSIVE DEMANDS FOR LONGER HOURS AND LESS PAY HE DECIDED TO LOCK OUT ALL EMPLOYEES
YOU1000000129_S0000076	AS THE STORY GOES JP MORGAN GLANCED AT THE OFFER AND WITHOUT HESITATION ACCEPTED IT MORGAN WOULD BUY CARNEGI STEEL FOR FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS MAKING CARNEGI THE SINGLE RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD AT THE TIME
YOU1000000129_S0000077	CARNEGI WOULD COMPLETELY CUT TIHES WITH HIS BUSINESS LIFE AND DEDICATE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF HIMSELF TO SERVING THE WORLD THROUGH PHILANTHROPY NOT A SINGLE DOLLAR WOULD BE LEFT TO HIS FAMILY
YOU1000000129_S0000078	BECAUSE ANDREW HAD ONLY FIVE YEARS OF SCHOOLING HE HAD A SOFT SPOT FOR LIBRARIES WHICH HE CREDITS FOR HELPING HIM ACHIEVE THE FINANCIAL SUCCESS HE ACQUIRED
YOU1000000129_S0000080	ONE EXAMPLE OF HIS GENEROSITY IS CARNEGI HALL ONE OF NEW YORK'S MOST RECOGNISABLE LANDMARKS BUILT IN EIGHT NINETY ONE CARNEGI BUILT AND DONATED THE BUILDING AS THE MUSIC HALL
YOU1000000129_S0000085	PERHAPS HE VIEWED DONATING HIS MONEY AS A WAY TO ATONE FOR HIS BUSINESS SINS MAKING MONEY IS A GREAT FEELING BUT AN EVEN BETTER FEELING IS GIVING IT AWAY IF YOU WANT TO GROW WEALTH AND PERHAPS DONATE TO NOBLE CAUSES LIKE CARNEGI DID
YOU1000000130_S0000011	BY THE TIME HENRY HAD BECOME A TEENAGER THE STEAM ENGINE WAS ALREADY MAKING ITS WAY INTO THE FARMING COMMUNITY COAL-POWERED THRESHING MACHINES AND SAWMILLS WERE BECOMING COMMON SIGHT AND HENRY WAS LEARNING HOW THEY WORKED AND HOW TO FIX THEM
YOU1000000130_S0000017	IT IS DURING THIS TIME THAT HENRY BY CHANCE LEARNED ABOUT THE GAS ENGINE FROM A BRITISH MAGAZINE IT WAS BEING PRODUCED IN SMALL NUMBERS BY A GERMAN ENGINEER NICHOLAS ATTO
YOU1000000130_S0000018	AND IT WAS GAINING SOME TRACTION IN EUROPE BUT IT WAS PRACTICALLY UNHEARD OF IN AMERICA HENRY WOULD GET THE CHANCE TO WORK ON SUCH AN ENGINE HIMSELF IN EIGHN EIGHTY NINE AND HE INSTANTLY RECOGNIZED THE ADVANTAGES IT HAD
YOU1000000130_S0000020	THIS ALSO ALLOWED THE GAS ENGINE TO START QUICKLY WHEREAS STEAM ENGINES OF THE TIME NEEDED AS MUCH AS THIRTY MINUTES TO HEAT UP THE WATER AND GENERATE ENOUGH STEAM TO START WORKING THE GAS ENGINE WAS AN INNOVATION HENRY FELL IN LOVE WITH
YOU1000000130_S0000023	IT WAS GENERATING ELECTRICITY FOR OVER A THOUSAND HOMES IN DETROIT AND IT WAS DOING SO BY USING STEAM ENGINES SO HENRY WAS A NATURAL HIRE FOR THEM WHENEVER THE ENGINES BROKE HENRY HAD TO FIX THEM BUT WHENEVER THEY WERE WORKING
YOU1000000130_S0000029	HE HAD DRIVEN A THOUSAND MILES I HENRY BUILT A SECOND QUADRICYCLE AND THEN A THIRD ONE ALWAYS IMPROVING THE DESIGN BEFORE FINALLY FEELING CONFIDENT ENOUGH IN EIGHTEN NINETY NINE TO START HIS OWN COMPANY
YOU1000000130_S0000032	AND EVERYONE WAS EAGER TO SEE WHAT HENRY COULD CREATE WITH PROPER CAPITAL HENRY'S PLAN WAS VERY CLEVER SINCE HE PERSONALLY KNEW MANY OF THE INDUSTRIALISTS IN DETROIT BY THAT POINT HE'D TRY TO BUILD AN AUTOMOBILE THEY COULD USE IN THEIR BUSINESSES
YOU1000000130_S0000033	HE LEASED A FACTORY AND PLANNED TO HIRE A HUNDRED WORKERS TO MAKE HIS NEW DELIVERY WAGEN AS HE CALLED IT BUT IT TURNED OUT THAT BUILDING SUCH COMPLEX MACHINES IN HIGH NUMBERS WAS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT THAN HENRY IMAGINED
YOU1000000130_S0000041	HENRY LABELED HIS FIRST DESIGN AS THE MODEL A AND WORKED HIS WAY THROUGH THE ALPHABET OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS SUSTAINED BY CAPITAL FROM HIS FRIENDS AND FAMILY
YOU1000000130_S0000044	THE BIGGEST GAME CHANGER OF ALL HOWEVER WAS HENRY'S CHANCE VISIT TO A SLAUGHTER HOUSE IN CHICAGO HE SAW THERE SOMETHING INTERESTING A DISASSEMBLY LINE SO TO SPEAK WHERE MULTIPLE WORKERS WOULD PROCESS CARCASSES MOVING DOWN TA LINE
YOU1000000130_S0000049	IT IS ACTUALLY DURING THE PRODUCTION OF THIS MODEL THAT HENRY WOULD FIRST USE THE ASSEMBLY LINE PROCESS TO AT LEAST PARTIALLY ASSEMBLE SOME OF HIS CARS
YOU1000000130_S0000060	THEY WOULD HELP HIM TRANSITION HIS ENTIRE MANUFACTURING PROCESS TO USE CANADIAN STEEL IT WAS THEIR CHIEF ENGINEER THAT BUILT THE HEAT TREATMENT PLANT FOR HENRY IN NINETEN OW SEVEN
YOU1000000130_S0000068	HENRY HAD BEGUN A NEW AGE IN AMERICAN HISTORY THE AGE OF THE AUTOMOBILE AND IT WAS HIS COMPANY THAT WOULD TOTALLY DOMINATE IT IN ITS FIRST TWO DECADES
YOU1000000130_S0000069	IT WASN'T UNTIL THE END OF THE NINETEEN TWENTY S THAT THE REST OF THE AUTO INDUSTRY CAUGHT UP TO HENRY BUT AT THAT POINT HE WAS ALREADY ONE OF THE RICHEST MEN ALIVE
YOU1000000131_S0000005	THE ORIGINS OF HISTORY'S GREATEST OIL MONOPOLY ARE ACTUALLY PRETTY HUMBLE IT ALL STARTS IN EIGHT THIRTY NINE WITH THE BIRTH OF JOHN ROCKEFELLER IN UPSTATE NEW YORK HE WAS THE ELDEST SON OF A TRAVELLING MERCHANT
YOU1000000131_S0000008	SO THEY COULD ALL LIVE TOGETHER IN THIS VERY CONFUSING HOUSEHOLD JOHN WOULD GROW UP LEARNING HOW TO HUSTLE PEOPLE FOR THE BEST DEAL POSSIBLE AND HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF EVERY PENNY HE GOT HIS FAMILY WOULD RARELY STAY IN ONE PLACE FOR LONG
YOU1000000131_S0000009	AND JOHN WOULD LIVE THIS NOMADIC LIFESTYLE EVER SINCE HE WAS THREE YEARS OLD TO HELP HIS MOTHER JOHN WOULD EARN ANY MONEY HE COULD BY RAISING TURKEYS OR DOING WORK FOR NEIGHBORS HIS INTELLIGENCE WAS PUT TO GOOD USE
YOU1000000131_S0000012	THANKS TO HIS GOOD REPUTATION HE GOT A LOAN OF FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH AT THE TIME WAS A HUGE SUM JOHN STARTED TRADING HAY GRAIN AND VARIOUS MEATS AND IN HIS FIRST YEAR HE RECORDED SALES OF HALF A MILLION DOLLARS
YOU1000000131_S0000019	FOR THE BYPRODUCTS OF REFINING PETROLEUM YOU SEE THE EARLY REFINERIES IN CLEVELAND COULD ONLY OPERATE AT ABOUT A SIXTY PERCENT EFFICIENCY BUT JOHN NOT ONLY INCREASED THAT PERCENTAGE HE ALSO STARTED SELLING ALL THE BYPRODUCTS LIKE PARAFINE WAX

POD1000000004_S0000137	OUR PAL DCR GREEN USED BLUE APRON FOR ABOUT A YEAR WHICH IS WAY LONGER THAN MOST OF ITS CUSTOMERS STUCK AROUND

POD1000000010_S0000095	THOMAS LACONA SAYS WE SEE SIGNS OF WHAT IS CALLED EMPATHIC DISTRESS EVEN IN TINY BABIES
POD1000000010_S0000098	AND TOM TOLD US THAT BABY'S MORAL SENSE SEEMS TO GO EVEN DEEPER
POD1000000010_S0000100	SO THIS IS LIKE I WAS SAYING CORE I ALWAYS THOUGHT KIDS ARE JUST BORN TO BE KIND
POD1000000010_S0000103	ONLY ABOUT A THIRD OF THE KIDS ACTUALLY RESPONDED IN THAT MOMENT WITH ALTRUISM WITH KINDNESS BY SAY GOING OVER TO THE CHILD OFFERING A HUG CALLING FOR AN ADULT
POD1000000010_S0000104	
POD1000000010_S0000106	OOEBELL HE'S TRYING TO TECK ON YOU
POD1000000010_S0000109	O GO FANA
POD1000000010_S0000112	MAI O YEA YE
POD1000000010_S0000138	AND THAT'S WHY SCARLET SAYS
POD1000000010_S0000144	THE JESSE LEWIS CHOOSE LOVE PROGRAM FOR KIDS FROM PREK THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL ACTUALLY BEGINS WITH COURAGE
POD1000000010_S0000145	AND I WANT TO MENTION THAT REPORTS OF THE SHOOTING SAID THAT JESSE HIMSELF SHOWED INCREDIBLE COURAGE
POD1000000010_S0000147	YEAH AND SCARLETT'S DEFINITION OF COURAGE IS EVEN BIGGER THAN THAT SORT OF
POD1000000010_S0000154	IT'S ALSO SCARLETT SAYS THE COURAGE TO STAND UP TO SOMEONE WHO'S BULLYING YOU OR SOMEONE YOU KNOW BY TAKING THEIR PERSPECTIVE AND SEEING THE WORLD THROUGH THEIR EYES
POD1000000010_S0000160	YOU KNOW HEARING ABOUT COURAGE IN THAT WAY AN THAT MOMENT REALLY SPOKE TO ME CORY BECAUSE I HAVE TO ADMIT THIS
POD1000000010_S0000161	I WAS A LITTLE AFRAID TO SIT DOWN WITH SCARLET
POD1000000010_S0000165	ONE REALLY PRACTICAL WAY SCARLOTT'S CHOSE LOVE PLAN BUILDS COURAGE IS BY TEACHING KIDS TO STAY CALM
POD1000000010_S0000170	JEN KATLER AT CESSAMY SAYS IF YOU'RE MORE AWARE OF YOUR EMOTIONS YOU'LL ALSO BE MORE AWARE OF EVERYONE ELSE'S
POD1000000010_S0000186	YEAH BEFORE JEN STARTED AT CESSAMY WORKSHOP SHE SPENT HER DAYS IN A CLASSROOM
POD1000000010_S0000190	THE PROBLEM JEN FOUND OUT WITH FORCED APOLOGIES IS THAT THEY'RE USUALLY PRETTY WORTHLESS
POD1000000010_S0000193	YEAH SO TOM LACONA AND JEN CUTLER BOTH TOLD US INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON KIDS PARENTING THE WORDS SORRY
POD1000000010_S0000196	GEN SAYS YOU CAN ACTUALLY TAKE A MOMENT LIKE THIS

POD1000000010_S0000231	TOM ALSO SAYS THET CHILDREN SHOULD LEARN TO MAKE AN APOLOGY OF ACTION
POD1000000010_S0000236	AND SCARLETT LEUWIS SAYS THAT MEANS WHEN PARENTS SCREW UP WE NEED TO APOLOGIZE TOO
POD1000000010_S0000240	IF ANYTHING SCARLETT TALKS EVEN MORE ABOUT THE OTHER SIDE OF AN APOLOGY FORGIVENESS
POD1000000010_S0000250	I LOVE THIS TOO BECAUSE SCARLETT IS REALLY FOCUSING ON THE BENEFIT OF LETTING GO OF ANGER
POD1000000010_S0000252	AND IT WAS AT THIS POINT WE'RE SITTING WITH SCARLET IN HER KITCHEN HER BACK IS TO ER REFRIGERATOR WHICH IS COVERED WITH PHOTOS OF JESSIE AND HER OTHER SON JA T AND WE JUST HAD TO ASK

POD1000000010_S0000281	YEAH PART OF HOW SCARLETT KEEPS GOING SHE TOLD US IS BY CONSTANTLY REMINDING HERSELF EVEN OUT LOUD WHAT SHE'S GRATEFUL FOR

POD1000000017_S0000087	AND ONE OF THE MANY PHASES IN WHICH DAVID BOBBY REALLY WANTED TO MAKE R AND B AND SOL MUSIC
POD1000000017_S0000089	THIS IS THE SOUND NOT JUST OF BLACK AMERICA BUT THE SOUND OF AMERICA IT IS DEEPLY AMERICAN ALMOST ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S SUNG BY BRITISH PEOPLE LIKE DAVID BOWEY AND ANNYE LENOX AND AMY WHINEHOUSE

POD1000000017_S0000114	IT'S WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE HEARD PASSING A BLACK PERSON DOING HIS JOB ENTERTAINING HIMSELF DOING THE DRUDGERY OF WORK THE WAY A GUY NAMED THOMAS DARTMOUTH RICE DID SOMETIME AROUND THE EIGHTEEN THIRTY S
POD1000000017_S0000116	ONE DAY HE'S TOURING WITH A TROOP IN CINCINNATI OR MAYB IT WAS PITTSBURG WE DON'T REALLY KNOW BUT THE MYTH BASICALLY GOES TD RACE HAPPENED UPON AN OLD BLACK MAN CLEANING A HORSE IN A STABLE
POD1000000017_S0000117	THE MAN WAS DOING HIS JOB ON PROPERTY OWNED BY A WHITE MAN NAMED CROW
POD1000000017_S0000122	WHATEVER RICE HEAR'S COMING OUT OF THIS MAN'S MOUTH IS CAPTIVATING TO HIM TAAND WHAT HE SEES O IS AN OPPORTUNITY
POD1000000017_S0000133	AND SO WHEN TINI RIC HEARS THIS BLACK MAN SINGING THIS SONG AND MOVING HIS BODY IN THIS PARTICULAR WAY DING A LIGHT BULB GOES OFF

POD1000000017_S0000142	AND THE LYRICS GIVE THE HORSE GROOMER A NAME AND THE NAME IS JIM CROW
POD1000000017_S0000146	THIS IS THE FIRST TIME A PAYING AUDIENCE IS BASICALLY ELECTRIFIED BY A WHITE MAN WITH A BLACK FACE THIS IS THE NIGHT THAT JIM CROW WAS ALLEGEDLY INTRODUCED TO AMERICA THIS MASCOT OF AMERICAN RACISM
POD1000000017_S0000148	AND HERE IS THOMAS DARTMOUTH RICE GIVING IT TO THEM THIS IS THE NIGHT THAT AMERICAN POPULAR CULTURE WAS BORN
POD1000000017_S0000151	SO YOU HAVE OTHER MINSTREL ACTS WHO COME ALONG AND TRY TO DO WHAT THOMAS DARTMOUTH RICSE IS DOING A SONG AND A DANCE

POD1000000017_S0000241	IN DUKE ELLINGTON
POD1000000018_S0000000	WHEN ANDY GRIFFITH PASSED AWAY IN TWENTY TWELVE CNN COVERED HIS DEATH OFF AND ON THE ENTIRE DAY
POD1000000018_S0000003	LARRY KING IS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO CALLED HIM TO TALK THAT DAY HE'D HAD ANDY ON HIS VARIOUS SHOWS NUMEROUS TIMES AND HE MENTIONED SOMETHING IN PASSING THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING
POD1000000018_S0000005	WHAT LARRY SAID IS THAT A LAWYER NAMED PERCY FORMAN WAS THE MAN WHO INSPIRED THE CHARACTER MATT LOCK
POD1000000018_S0000007	THIS WAS A WEIRD THING FOR ANYONE TO SAY BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE EVEN TODAY BELIEVE THAT CHARACTER TO BE BASED ON A DIFFERENT LAWYER NAMED BOBBY LEE COOK
POD1000000018_S0000009	HOWEVER IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THREE YEARS AFTER LARRY KING SAID SOMETHING THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD ASSUME WAS INCORRECT THE CREATOR OF MAT LOCK DID CONFIRM THAT THE CHARACTER WAS BASED ON PERCY FORMAN
POD1000000018_S0000012	PERCY WAS ABLE TO ACHIEVE THIS RECORD BY BEING AN INCREDIBLE LAWYER NO DENYING IT BUT ALSO DUE TO THE TEXAS COURT SYSTEM'S PRACTICE OF USING JURIES TO DETERMINE GUILT AS WELL AS SENTENCING IN THE CASE OF A GUILTY VERDICT
POD1000000018_S0000016	PERCY HAD TWELVE AVERAGE CITIZENS FROM THE LOCAL COMMUNITY SITTING RIGHT THERE WAITING TO BE CONVINCED THAT THE VICTIM IN THIS SITUATION WASN'T A VICTIM AT ALL
POD1000000018_S0000019	FORMAN CALLED IT MISDEMEANOR MURDER THAT'S WHERE A JURY MIGHT CONVICT YOU OF ENDING ANOTHER PERSON'S LIFE AND SEND YOU ON YOUR WAY WITH THE TYPE OF PUNISHMENT YOU'D RECEIVE FOR A MISDEMEANOR CRIME
POD1000000018_S0000021	PERCY FORMAN HAD SUCH A LONG RUN OF WINS WITH THIS STRATEGY THAT IT'S STILL BEING USED IN TEXAS TODAY PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS SORT OF THING WILL SOMETIMES REFER TO IT AS THE TEXAS DEFENSE
POD1000000018_S0000023	NOW JIM DENNEY WASN'T FROM TEXAS HE WAS FROM TENNESSEE
POD1000000018_S0000025	WHEN A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD JIM DENNY GOT HIRED TO WORK THE MAIL ROOM OF W S M RADIO'S PARENT COMPANY HE MUST HAVE SEEN IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF HIMSELF
POD1000000018_S0000027	DENNY GOT THIS JOB IN NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN THAT YEAR THE YOUNG RADIO PROGRAM WS M BARN DANCE WAS REFERRED TO AS THE GRANDDOLA OPERA FOR THE FIRST TIME ON AIR
POD1000000018_S0000029	EVERY TIME AN ODD JOB CAME UP AT THE OPERA OLIANO JIM WOULD TAKE IT SO HE COULD HANG OUT BACK STAGE SEE THE ARTISTS AND SEE HOW THE SHOW WAS MADE
POD1000000018_S0000030	WITHIN TWENTY YEARS DENNY HAD WORKED HIS WAY UP TO DIRECTOR OF THE ARTIST SERVICE BUREAU AT WSM WHICH MEANT HE WAS IN CHARGE OF BOOKING THE AX ON THE OPERA
POD1000000018_S0000032	THERE'S A FEW FUNNY THINGS FROM JIM DENNEY'S TIME AT THE GRANDOLE OPERA LIKE THE ONE ABOUT ELVIS PRESLE'S BIG DEBUT
POD1000000018_S0000033	ELVIS WAS STILL A TEENAGER WHEN DENNY DID SAM PHILLIPS THE FAVOR OF LETTING ELVIS COME ON THE SHOW TO PLAY HIS NOT COUNTRY ARRANGEMENT OF BLUE MOON OF KENTUCKY
POD1000000018_S0000035	IT DIDN'T GO WELL DENNY IS RUOMORED TO HAVE TOLD ELVIS BACKSTAGE YOU AIN'T GOING NOWHERE SON YOU OUGHT TO GO BACK TO DRIVIN A TRUCK
POD1000000018_S0000037	DENNY'S ALSO THE GUY WHO FIRED HANK WILLIAMS OVER THE TELEPHONE AND THERE'S THE TIME WHEN JIM MADE JOHNNY CASH WAIT OUTSIDE HIS OFFICE FOR TWO HOURS BEFORE LETTING HIM IN TO ASK WHY CASH SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO PLAY ON THE OPERA
POD1000000018_S0000039	KASH MENTIONED THAT HE PRESENTLY HAD A SONG CALLED I WALK THE LINE IN THE TOP TEN
POD1000000018_S0000041	JIM DENNY WAS WHAT MANY PEOPLE REFERRED TO IN THOSE TIMES AS A HARD MAN TODAY I THINK THEY'D HAVE SOME DIFFERENT WORDS FOR HIM AND THAT'S WHY EARNIST TUBB TRIED TO SHOOT HIM IN NINETEN FIFTY SEVEN
POD1000000018_S0000044	MY NAME IS TYLER MAYHAN CO I'VE HEARD THESE STORIES MY WHOLE LIFE
POD1000000018_S0000047	IT'S SHOCKING TO HEAR ERNEST TOB'S NAME ASSOCIATED WITH ANY KIND OF VIOLENCE WHATSOEVER
POD1000000018_S0000051	HRISP TEXAS IS A GHOST TOWN NOW EARNEST TUBB WAS BORN THERE IN NINETEEN FOURTEEN INTO A FAMILY OF SHARECROPPERS LIKE MOST SHARECROPPER' CHILDREN ERNEST GREW UP WORKING ON FARMS ALL OVER THE AREA
POD1000000018_S0000054	LIKE A GREAT NUMBER OF ARTISTS WILL LEARN ABOUT IN FUTURE EPISODES IT WAS ALL OVER FOR A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD EARNEST TUBB THE FIRST TIME HE HEARD JIMMY ROGERS SING
POD1000000018_S0000058	EARING JIMMY ROGERS IS WHAT LED ERNEST TUBB TO DECIDE HE SIMPLY HAD TO BECOME A COUNTRY SINGER
POD1000000018_S0000059	IT'S ALSO VERY SPECIFICALLY WHAT CAUSED HIM THREE DECADES LATER TO WANT TO SHOOT A THREE FIFTY SEVEN MAGNUM AT JIM DENNEY
POD1000000018_S0000062	THE DEATH OF HIS IDOL WAS EXTREMELY UPSETTING FOR EARNEST  HOWEVER IT ALSO MADE HIM REALIZE THAT HE WAS GOING TO HAVE TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT CHASING HIS DREAMS
POD1000000018_S0000067	HOLDING DOWN THREE JOBS AT ONCE WAS NECESSARY TO SUPPORT HIMSELF AND HIS YOUNG WIFE ELAINE THEY DIDN'T WASTE ANY TIME BEFORE STARTING TO HAVE KIDS EITHER
POD1000000018_S0000069	EARNEST WAS MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK HARD IF IT KEPT HIM MOVING TOWARDS THE LIFE OF HIS HERO JIMMY ROGERS
POD1000000018_S0000070	HE'D HAD THIS SMALL PICTURE OF JIMMY FOR YEARS NOW AND IT WAS IN PRETTY BAD SHAPE SO HE GOT A PHONE BOOK AND LOOKED UP THE NUMBER FOR JIMMY ROGER'S WIDOW CARIE
POD1000000018_S0000071	HE CALLED HER ON THE PHONE TO EXPLAIN THAT HE WAS SUCH A BIG FAN AND TO SEE IF SHE HAPPENED TO HAVE A BIGGER BETTER PHOTO OF JIMMY THAT ERNIST COULD HAVE MAYBE EVEN ONE THAT WAS AUTOGRAPHED
POD1000000018_S0000072	CARRIE WAS SUPER NICE AND SHE DID HAVE SUCH A PHOTO THAT ERNIST COULD HAVE AND WENT SO FAR AS TO INVITE HIM OUT TO HER HOUSE IN CARVILLE TEXAS TO GET THE PICTURE
POD1000000018_S0000073	EARNIST DROVE OUT THERE THE NEXT SUNDAY HE WASN'T WORKING TAKING ELANE AND THEIR BABY JUSTIN ON THE TRIP
POD1000000018_S0000075	THEY'D PLANNED TO STAY FOR MAYBE TEN MINUTES AND ENDED UP HANGING OUT FOR OVER TWO HOURS LOOKING AT COSTUMES GUITARS AND PICTURES BROUGHT OUT BY MRS ROGERS HEARING HER STORIES ABOUT HOW HIGH ON THE HOG THEY'D LIVED MERELY A FEW YEARS EARLIER
POD1000000018_S0000076	ET COULD NEVER HAVE GUESSED WHEN HE WOKE UP THAT MORNING THAT HE'D BE LAYING DOWN TO SLEEP THAT NIGHT HAVING HELD JIMMY ROGERS' SIGNATURE MARTIN ACOUSTIC GUITAR WITH JIMMY'S NAME INLAID IN PEARL ACROSS THE FRET BOARD AND THE WORD THANKS WRITTEN ON THE BACK UPSIDE DOWN
POD1000000018_S0000080	OKAY NOW ADD THIS ON TOP OF THAT A FEW MONTHS LATER CARRE ROGERS CALLED ERNEST TO SAY SHE'D LISTENED FOR HIS RADIO SHOW AS HE'D ASKED FOR HER TO DO
POD1000000018_S0000082	ON THE OTHER HAND SHE DIDN'T THINK HE SOUNDED LIKE JIMMY ROGERS WHEN HE SANG WHICH IS BASICALLY THE ONLY THING IN THE WORLD EARNEST HUBB WANTED TO DO IN THIS PHASE OF HIS LIFE
POD1000000018_S0000085	ANYWAY SHE'S STILL HOOKED E T UP WITH ELSIE MCWILLIAMS THE WRITER OF A FEW GREAT JIMMY ROGERS SONGS
POD1000000018_S0000086	ERNEST TUBB MADE A COUPLE OF RECORDS THAT DIDN'T SELL VERY WELL DID SOME TOURING AND ENDED UP BACK HOME DOING LOW PAYING RADIO AGAIN AND WORKING TWO OR THREE SIDE JOBS LIKE BEFORE DRIVING AROUND A BEER TRUCK WAS ONE OF THEM
POD1000000018_S0000088	AFTER A WHILE BACK AT HOME EARNEST HAD TO HAVE HIS TONSELES TAKEN OUT HE'D LATER SAY THE DOCTORS TOLD HIM NOT TO SING OR YODLE FOR A WHILE AFTER THE SURGERY BUT HE DIDN'T LISTEN
POD1000000018_S0000093	ERNEST HELD A SELF-DEPRECATING SENSE OF HUMOR ABOUT HIS OWN VOICE FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE HE LOVED TO SAY THAT NINE OUT OF TEN GUYS SITTING IN BARS AROUND THE COUNTRY COULD SING MUCH BETTER THAN HE COULD
POD1000000018_S0000094	I DON'T KNOW IF HE REALLY BELIEVED THAT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN STRANGE TO ME I THINK GEORGE JONES INDISPUTABLY THE GREATEST COUNTRY SINGER IN HISTORY IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ADD ERNEST TUBB'S NEW SINGING STYLE AND ROY A CUFF'S VOICE TOGETHER
POD1000000018_S0000096	JUST HEARD SOME EARNEST HERE'S A LITTLE ROY ACUFF FROM NINETN FORTY TWO

POD1000000018_S0000150	HE REALIZED THE MORE JIMMY ROGERS RECORDS SOLD THE BETTER OFF CARRI WOULD BE SO E T PUSHED THOSE RECORDS AS HARD AS HE COULD
POD1000000018_S0000151	CARRIE LOANED AND EVENTUALLY FLAT OUT GAVE HIM THAT GUITAR OF JIMMY'S WHICH IS WHY YOU'LL FREQUENTLY SEE PICTURES OR VIDEOS OF EARNEST TUBB PLAYING A GUITAR THAT SAYS JIMMY ROGERS ON IT

POD1000000018_S0000162	JIM DENNY MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN A DICK HE COULD HAVE SIMPLY BEEN A BUSINESS MAN WHO PAID MORE ATTENTION TO THE BOTTOM LINE THAN HOW MANY FRIENDS HE HAD
POD1000000018_S0000163	DENNY'S THE GUY WHO HAD TO BE CONVINCED TO LET HANK SENIOR ONTO THE OPERA AND HE'S THE GUY WHO CALLED HANK TO FIRE HIM OVER THE TELEPHONE BUT EARNEST TUBB WAS STANDING IN DENNY'S OFFICE WHEN THAT PHONE CALL WAS MADE
POD1000000018_S0000164	HE SAID HE SAW TEARS IN JIM'S EYES

POD1000000018_S0000166	THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED HANK WILLIAMS DIED FOUR MONTHS AFTER BEING DISMISSED FROM THE OPERA IT'S TRAGIC BUT YOU CAN SEE HOW JIM DENNY THOUGHT HE WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING IN THAT SITUATION
POD1000000018_S0000167	THIS IS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE BECAUSE THE YEAR HANK WILLIAMS DIED IS THE SAME YEAR THAT JIM DENNEY FORMED CEDARWOOD PUBLISHING WITH WEB PIERCE

POD1000000018_S0000178	IF JIM DENNEY OWNS A COUNTRY MUSIC PUBLISHING FIRM WHILE RETAINING SINGULAR CONTROL OF THE MOST POPULAR COUNTRY MUSIC RADIO PROGRAM IN AMERICA THEN HE'S ESSENTIALLY PRINTING HIS OWN MONEY

POD1000000018_S0000191	IT LOOKED AS THOUGH EVERYONE WAS GETTING WHAT THEY WANTED UNTIL THE PHILIP MORIS COUNTRY MUSIC SHOW BOOKED A STOP IN MARIDIAN MISSISSIPPI ON THE SAME WEEK AS THE FIFTH ANNUAL JIMMY ROGERS MEMORIAL FESTIVAL
POD1000000018_S0000194	FOR FIVE YEARS ERNEST TUBB HAD WORKED TO GROW THE JIMMY ROGERS FESTIVAL FROM SCRATCH THIS IS A TREMENDOUSLY DIFFICULT THING TO DO E T PUT IN THE EFFORT TO HONOR HIS IDOLE

POD1000000018_S0000197	HE BROUGHT A FREE SHOW TO TOWN ON THE SAME NIGHT WITH HALF THE GRAND OLD OPERA LINEUP AND SEVERAL BIG NAMES YOU WOULD HAVE HAD TO BUY A TICKET TO SEE ON THE JIMMY ROGERS EVENT THE PREVIOUS NIGHT
POD1000000018_S0000199	IT WOULD CRUSH BONAROU THIS WAS SUCH A BIG DEAL THAT THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE JIMMY ROGERS MEMORIAL FESTIVAL THE FOLLOWING YEAR

POD1000000018_S0000205	ACCORDING TO BILLY BIRD ERNEST TUBB'S REACTION TO THE PHILIP MORRICS COUNTRY MUSIC SHOW UNDERCUTTING THE JIMMY ROGERS MEMORIAL FESTIVAL WAS TO GET DRUNK AND STAY DRUNK FOR THE BETTER PART OF A WEEK

POD1000000018_S0000210	MEANWHILE WHEN JIM DENNY HAD HUNG UP THE PHONE HE SIMPLY TOOK IT BACK OFF THE HOOK AGAIN SO EARNIST COULDN'T CALL HIM ANYMORE AND THEN WENT BACK TO SLEEP
POD1000000018_S0000212	SO ERNEST TUBB IS DRUNK OFF HIS ASS WITH A LOADED GUN WHEN HE STUMBLES INTO THE LOBBY OF THE NATIONAL LIFE BUILDING WHERE WSM WAS LOCATED
POD1000000018_S0000217	BILL WILLIAMS THE NEWS DIRECTOR AT WSM SAYS HE WAS WALKING INTO WORK WHEN A GUNSHOT RANG OUT IN THE LOBBY AND A BULLET WENT OVER HIS HEAD INTO THE WALL

POD1000000018_S0000222	EITHER WAY EARNEST SETTLED DOWN AFTER THINKING HE'D SHOT AN INNOCENT PERSON BILL WILLIAMS CALLED HIS BOSS JACK TE WIT TO TELL HIM WHAT HAPPENED JACK TOLD BILL TO TAKE ERNEST HOME
POD1000000018_S0000225	EARNEST HUBB WENT TO JAIL FOR DRUNK END DISORDERLY PLUS CARRYING THE WEAPON
POD1000000018_S0000227	SO EARNEST BOUGHT CIGARETTES FOR ALL THE OTHER INMATES AND SANG SONGS WITH HEM WHILE BILL WILLIAMS WAITED TO TAKE HIM HOME
POD1000000018_S0000231	JIM DENNY'S NAME WAS KEPT OUT OF THE PAPERS THOUGH EVERYONE IN THE BUSINESS COULD READ BETWEEN THE LINES AND SEE WHO EARNEST HAD WANTED TO SHOOT
POD1000000018_S0000233	THE INCIDENT SEEMS TO HAVE HAD NO EFFECT ON ERNEST HUBB'S CAREER WHATSOEVER APPARENTLY IF ALL E T WAS TRYING TO DO WAS PUT A BULLET IN JIM DENNY THEN THAT WAS FINE
POD1000000018_S0000236	IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR HIS LUNGS KILLED HIM JUST LIKE HIS HERO JIMMY ROGERS

POD1000000018_S0000255	IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY S CLYDE MOODY TRIED TO START AN ALTERNATIVE ASSOCIATION TO THE COUNTRY MUSIC HALL OF FAME CALLED THE COUNTRY MUSIC PIONEER ASSOCIATION
POD1000000018_S0000256	THE CMPA HAD A TRASHY NEWSPAPER THAT CLYDE ESSENTIALLY USED TO RANT AGAINST THE INDUSTRY AND PRINT WHATEVER SHITTY RUMORS PEOPLE SENT IN
POD1000000018_S0000257	AMONG THESE RUMORS WAS ONE THAT ERNEST TUB DIED BROKE AND ALONE IN A CHEAP DOWNTOWN MOTEL SHUNNED BY THE COUNTRY MUSIC WORLD HE'D DONE SO MUCH TO HELP
POD1000000018_S0000259	CHARLIE LUVIN EVEN HAS IT IN HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY WHICH ISN'T THE ONLY THING CHARLIE GOT WRONG IN THAT BOOK BUT I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT ANOTHER TIME
POD1000000018_S0000260	FIRST OF ALL THE SOURCE WAS EARNEST TUBB'S ASTRANGED WIFE NEXT ERNEST DIED OWNING SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE EARNEST TUB RECORD SHOP WHICH HAD MULTIPLE LOCATIONS RUNNING AND WAS VERY PROFITABLE AT THAT TIME HE WAS NOT A BROKE MAN
POD1000000018_S0000262	I BELIEVE ERNIST CHOSE TO TURN VISITORS AWAY BECAUSE HE WAS WASTING A WAY OF EMPHIZEMA AND DIDN'T WANT ANYONE WHO LOVED HIM TO HAVE THAT AS THEIR LAST MEMORY OF HIM
POD1000000018_S0000265	AND I THINK JUSTIN SAID THAT PEOPLE WOULD GO WOULD TRY TO SEE EARNEST AND HE WOULD TELL JUSTIN TO TELL THEM THANK YOU BUT HE'D RATHER NOT HAVE THE COMPANY
POD1000000018_S0000266	SO YOU KNOW I MEAN THE END I IDON'T THINK THAT EARNEST TUB DIED YOU KNOW IN A SAD STATE OF AFFAIRS I THINK THAT HE DID

POD1000000022_S0000036	THAT GUY NOW THIS MAN BELIEVES BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT THAT HE IS NAPOLEON IF YOU SAT HIM DOWN AND YOU ASKED HIM CANDIDLY NO BUT WHO ARE YOU REALLY DEEP DOWN INSIDE HE WOULD SAY I AM NAPOLEON BONAPART COMMANDER O THE ARMIES OF THE NORTH
POD1000000022_S0000037	HUSBAND TO A MURDRED WIFE FATHER TO A MURDERED SON AND I WILL HAVE MY VENGEANCE BUT IS THIS MAN REALLY NAPOLEON WE KNOW HE'S NOT NAPOLEON IN FACT IN A WEIRD WAY AS OUTSIDERS WE SEEM TO HAVE AN ADVANTAGE WHEN IT COMES TO KNOWING WHO HE REALLY IS
POD1000000022_S0000040	I'M GOING TO THE SPORTING GOODS SECTION IMEANI'M GONNA GO UP INTO THE RAFTERS LIKE I'M TOM CRUZ AND SNAP THE DUDE'S NECK I'M GOINGTO DO THIS BECAUSE THAT'S JUST THE KIND OF PERSON I AM THAT'S ME I'D SACRIFICE MY LIFE FOR THE GREATER GOOD NOW HE MAY TELL HIS FRIENDS THIS
POD1000000022_S0000044	SARTRA SAYS THAT WHEN YOU TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THE SELF IT'S NOT A SOUL IT'S NOT A PERSONALITY HIDDEN DEEP WITHIN YOU WHAT WE'RE REFERENCING WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE SELF TURNS OUT TO BE MUCH MORE COMPLEX THAN THAT WITH MANY MORE MOVING PARTS
POD1000000022_S0000045	AND I THINK A GOOD PLACE TO BEGIN IF WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND SARTRA'S VIEWS ON WHAT THE SELF REALLY IS IS TO TALK ABOUT TWO FOUNDATIONAL ASPECTS OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A HUMAN BEING THAT THE SARTRA SEEM TO BE CONSTANTLY INTERTWINED AND DEPENDENT UPON EACH OTHER WHAT HE CALLS OUR FACTICITY
POD1000000022_S0000048	FULLY AFFIRMATIVE AND BEING FOR ITSELF AS BEING CONSCIOUSNESS OR THE SOURCE OF ALL NEGATION WELL ONE DAY WHEN SARTR WAS TRYING TO MEET HIS MONTHLY QUOTA FOR OBSCURE SOUNDING PHILOSOPHICAL DESCRIPTIONS THE WAY HE DESCRIBES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO ONTOLOGICAL CATEGORIES IS THAT BEING IN ITSELF
POD1000000022_S0000049	TE IS WHAT IT IS AND BEING FOR ITSELF QUOTE IS WHAT IT IS NOT WELL AS WEIRD AS THAT SOUNDS IN A VACUUM AFTER LISTENING TH LAST EPISODE WE ALL KNOW WHAT HE MEANS WHEN HE SAYS IT BUT THEN SARTER POINTS OUT SOMETHING VERY MYSTERIOUS A VERY STRANGE COINCIDENCE
POD1000000022_S0000050	WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO ONTOLOGICAL CATEGORIES TWO THINGS THAT ARE EASY TO WRITE OFF IS JUST THESE MEANINGLESS ABSTRACT CONCEPTS THAT START TO COOK UP ONE DAY WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW BEING IN ITSELF AND BEING FOR ITSELF RELATE TO EACH OTHER
POD1000000022_S0000051	SARTE NOTICES THERE SEEMS TO BE A SIMILAR SORT OF RELATIONSHIP AT THE FOUNDATION OF WHO WE ARE AS PEOPLE SEE BECAUSE ON ONE HAND ALL OF US HAVE OUR FACTICITY AND FACTICITY IS KIND OF LIKE BEING IN ITSELF IT'S THE FULLY AFFIRMATIVE SET OF FACTS THAT ARE TRUE ABOUT US
POD1000000022_S0000053	I'M SCARED OF SPIDERS THINGS LIKE THAT RIGHT IN OTHER WORDS STATEMENTS OF FACTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY TRUE ABOUT US THAT'S WHAT MAKES UP OUR FACTICITY BUT WHAT SARTRAR WOULD WANT US TO COSIDER IS THAT WHILE THESE KINDS OF STATEMENTS ARE NO DOUBT USEFUL WHEN IT COMES TO DESCRIBING CERTAIN PIECES OF WHO I AM
POD1000000022_S0000058	YOU CAN START TO HEAR THE WEIRD SARTRER DESCRIPTION CREEPING IN THERE JUST LIKE BEING IN ITSELF IS WHAT IT IS AND BEING FOR ITSELF IS WHAT IT IS NOT IN A SENSE I AM WHAT I AM I HAVE A FACTICITY BUT I ALSO AM WHAT I AM NOT YET
POD1000000022_S0000066	WHEN SARTA TALKS ABOUT RADICAL FREEDOM WHEN ANY OF US TALK ABOUT BEING INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE FREE TO ACT AS THEY CHOOSE WE'RE NEVER TALKING ABOUT TOTAL FREEDOM RIGHT IT'S ALWAYS FREEDOM WITHIN CERTAIN LIMITATIONS
POD1000000022_S0000072	BUT YEAH ULTIMATELY THE POINT SARTR'S MAKING HERE WITH THE CONCEPTS OF FACTICITY AND TRANSCENDENCE IS NOT ONLY TO STOP THINKING ABOUT YOURSELF AS THOUGH IT'S THIS ARTIFACT HIDDEN DEEP WITHIN YOU INSIDE OF A VAULT BUT ALSO STOP THINKING ABOUT WHO YOU ARE AS THOUGH IT'S THIS STATIC
POD1000000022_S0000075	UNLESS IF YOU'RE DEAD YOU'VE NEVER ARRIVED AT A DESTINATION AS A HUMAN BEING NOW AT FIRST GLANCE THIS MAY SEEM LIKE SARTRA'S WRITING A SELF-HELP BOOK NO NO SINGLE FACT ABOUT YOU SUMS UP WHO YOU ARE RELEASE YOUR INNER TRANSCENDENCE NO
POD1000000022_S0000076	NO LIKE WE TOUCHED ON LAST TIME SARTO THINKS THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE TRULY FACED WITH THE NUMBER OF THESE POSSIBILITIES THEY'RE FREE TO CHOOSE FROM MOST OF THE TIME THEY DON'T GET EXCITED THEY'RE HORRIFIED BY IT IN FMACT MOST OF THE TIME ONCE PEOPLE REALIZE THIS STUFF
POD1000000022_S0000077	SARTRA THINKS THAT THE SECRET COVERT DESIRE OF EVERYONE WHETHER THEY REALIZE IT OR NOT IS TO ESCAPE THIS DUALITY IT'S TO TURN THEMSELVES INTO EITHER PURE FACTICITY OR PURE TRANSCENDENCE OR AS SARTRA SAYS WE ALL SECRETLY WANT TO BECOME GOD
POD1000000022_S0000080	GOD IS PERFECT AS HE IS PURE FACTICITY BUT ON THE OTHER HAND GOD IS ALL POWERFUL AND CAPABLE OF BRINGING ABOUT ANY POSSIBILITY HE WANTS IN OTHER WORDS PURE TRANSCENDENCE SARTRA WOULD SAY THIS IS NO COINCIDENCE
POD1000000022_S0000083	OR PURE TRANSCENDENCE LIKE GOD IS WHAT SARTRA CALLS BAD FAITH LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE MOST FAMOUS EXAMPLE OF BAD FAITH THAT SARTRA LAYS OUT AND BECAUSE WE LREADY TALKED ABOUT IN THE OTHER EPISODE I'LL KEEP IT BRIEF
POD1000000022_S0000084	SARTE TALKS ABOUT SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF A CAFE IN PARIS WATCHING A WAHTER AS HE DOES HIS JOB NOW YOU CAN IMAGINE A WAITER IN THE NINETEEN FORTY S RIGHT DRESSED UP IN HIS LITTLE OUTFIT VERY UPRIGHT GOOD POSTURE VERY PROPER
POD1000000022_S0000085	HE HOLDS THE TRAY IN A PARTICULAR WAY HE WALKS AND CHANGES DIRECTION IN A VERY MILITARISTIC PARTICULAR WAY LIKE A GOOD WAITER DOES SARTER CAN'T HELP BUT POINT OUT THAT THIS GUY DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A SELF WITH FACTICITY AND TRANSCENDENCE IN THIS MOMENT
POD1000000022_S0000087	GO TO MOST RESTAURANTS AND YOU CAN FIND SOME MODERN VERSION OF WHAT SARTWAS TALKING ABOUT HERE I MEAN THERE'S SO MANY SERVERS OUT THERE THAT HAVE FALLEN INTO BAD FAITH AND ARE JUST SORT OF PLAYING THE ROLE OF THE SAME PERSON IT SEEMS TO BE A MODERN ARCHITYPE OF WHAT IT IS TO BE A SERVER THEY ALL SAY THE SAME STUFF
POD1000000022_S0000088	HI I'M JOHN I'M GONNA BE TAKING CARE OF YOU TODAY CAN I GET YOU GUYS STARTED WITH A BOTTOMLESS BUCKET OF SHRIMP OR SOME DRINKS OR SOMETHING BUT IT'S AT EVERY STAGE OF THE MEAL HOW'S EVERYTHING TASTED FOR YOU GUYS YALL SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT NOW THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO RUSH I'M GON TO LEAVE THE CHECK HERE I'M GOINNA GO VER THERE
POD1000000022_S0000090	ASK YOURSELF IS THIS THE WAY THIS GUY TALKS TO HIS MOM IS THIS THE WAY HE TALKS TO HIS BEST FRIENDS NO HE'S FALLEN INTO BAD FAITH AND IS JUST PLAYING THE PART OF A SERVER NOW THE POINT SARTR'S MAKING IS NOT THAT WAITERS NEED TO BE MORE CREATIVE IT'S NOT ABOUT WAITERS
POD1000000022_S0000091	SARTHER THINKS THAT AS HUMAN BEINGS WE HAVE A TENDENCY TO GRAVITATE TOWARDS THIS TRAP IN ALL ASPECTS OF OUR LIFE WE MAKE PROCLAMATIONS ABOUT WHAT WE ARE ALL THE TIME I AM A STAY-AT HOME MOM THAT'S MY IDENTITY
POD1000000022_S0000094	AND WE USE BAD FAITH TO QUELL THIS FEELING OF NAUSA WE'RE CONSTANTLY DOING THIS WITH OURSELVES NOW IF ALL YOU EVER READ WAS SARTRA'S BEING IN NOTHINGNESS YOU MIGHT GET THE READ FROM THE BOOK THAT THIS TENDENCY WE HAVE TO GRAVITATE TOWARDS BAD FAITH
POD1000000022_S0000096	BUT IN ONE OF THE FOOTNOTES OF BEING IN NOTHINGNESS SARTRA ALLUDES TO A WAY OUT OF ALL OF IT AND PERHAPS TO AN ETHICS THAT HE'D WRITE LATER ON IN HIS LIFE WELL HE NEVER WRITES IN ETHICS AND IT MAY BE BECAUSE YOU KNOW HIS LIFELONG PARTNER
POD1000000022_S0000097	AND FELLOW EXISTENTIALIST SAMONE DE BAVAR PRODUCES WHAT MANY CONSIDER TO BE THE GREATEST EXISTENTIALIST APPROACH TO ETHICS CALLED THE ETHICS OF AMBIGUITY NEXT EPISODE IS PART TWO ON SAMONE D BAVAR SO WERE GONA TO TALKING ALL ABOUT IT UBUT ENOUGH OF BAD FAITH LET'S GET BACK TO ANSWERING THIS QUESTION WHO AM I
POD1000000022_S0000100	SARTRA WOULD SAY YOU DON'T HAVE SOME PRIVILEGED V IP ACCESS TO THE FACTS THAT ARE TRUE ABOUT YOU AND THE POSSIBILITIES THAT YOU HAVE I MEAN HYPOTHETICALLY ANY OTHER PERSON IF THEY WERE DILIGENT ENOUGH HAS ACCESS TO YOUR FACTICITY AND TRANSCENDENCE
POD1000000022_S0000101	IN FACT JUST LIKE THE GUY THAT TELLS HIMSELF THAT HE'S NAPOLEON SOMETIMES OTHER PEOPLE ARE BETTER AT TELLING US WHO WE ARE THAN WE ARE BUT HOW'S THIS POSSIBLE THE REASON IT'S POSSIBLE IS BECAUSE THE SELF IS NOT THE CHRISTIAN SOUL DO SARTRA
POD1000000022_S0000104	NO WE TELL OURSELVES STORIES ALL THE TIME WHAT FOLLOWS FROM THIS IS THAT THE TRUE MEASURE OF YOUR VALUES THE TRUE MEASURE OF WHO YOU ARE IS WHAT YOU ACTUALLY DO IT'S THE COLLECTION OF WHAT YOU'VE ACTUALLY DONE THUS FAR IN YOUR LIFE AND SARTA SAYS THAT WHEN YOU STOP LOOKING AT THE SELF
POD1000000022_S0000107	NOTHINGNESS THAT SARTE LAYS OUT HIS THIRD ONTOLOGICAL CATEGORY WHAT HE CALLS BEING FOR OTHERS LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT HE MEANS SARTR WOULD SAY THAT AN INTRINSIC PART OF WHAT IT IS TO BE YOU IS EXISTING ALONGSIDE OTHER PEOPLE AND ALL THE CONSEQUENCES THAT COME ALONG WITH THAT
POD1000000022_S0000108	THIS IS SARTRO'S CONCEPT OF BEING FOR OTHERS NOW HOW DOES BEING FOR OTHERS AFFECT MY ANSWER TO THE QUESTION WHO AM I WELL AGAIN THIS CONCEPT OF THE SELF IS OUTSIDE OF US IT'S AN ABSTRACTION
POD1000000022_S0000109	AND WHAT SARTRA POINTS OUT IS THAT THERE ARE MANY ASPECTS ABOUT WHO WE ARE THAT ARE GIVEN TO US BY OTHER PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE WHETHER WE'RE TRUSTWORTHY OR NOT WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE A TRUSTWORTHY PERSON IS AN ASPECT OF WHO YOU ARE THAT'S MEDIATED BY OTHER PEOPLE RIGHT
POD1000000022_S0000111	AND HOW OTHER PEOPLE VIEW US SEEM TO BE CONNECTED TO SARTRA BUT THE FLIP SIDE OF IT BEING THAT INTERCONNECTED IS THAT IT LEAVES US IN WHAT HE DESCRIBES AS A PERPETUAL STATE OF BEING JUDGED BY THE PEOPLE AROUND US
POD1000000022_S0000114	YOU WILL HENCEFORTH BE KNOWN AS THE WEIRD SHOES GUY IN THAT PERSON'S MIND THIS IS CONSTANTLY GOING ON BUT SARKR'S NOT SAYING IT'S ALWAYS BAD THAT BEING AROUND OTHER PEOPLE IS SOME PARANOID EVERYBODY'S THINKING BAD THINGS ABOUT ME ALL THE TIME THING
POD1000000022_S0000115	PEOPLE VERY WELL MAY BE THINKING REALLY GOOD THINGS ABOUT YOU ALL THE TIME THE POINT THAT SARTRER WANTS TO MAKE IS THAT THIS WHOLE DYNAMIC THIS DYNAMIC OF OTHER PEOPLE SEEING YOU PUTTING YOU ON TRIAL AND TURNING YOU INTO PURE FACTICITY IN THEIR MINDS THIS IS GOING ON ALL THE TIME
POD1000000022_S0000121	IT MAY SEEM TO US LIKE WE HAVE A SORT OF SPECIAL ACCESS TO KNOWING WHO WE ARE AND THAT WE CHOOSE TO SHARE OURSELVES WITH ONLY OUR CLOSEST FRIENDS WHO WE TRUST DEARLY BUT SARTA WOULD SAY THAT THE REASON IT SEEMS THAT WAY IS BECAUSE WHAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE IS A NARRATIVE ABOUT YOURSELF
POD1000000022_S0000124	IS BECAUSE THAT'S THE VERY CRITERIA WE ALL USE TO CHOOSE WHO OUR FRIENDS ARE GOINGTA BE IS WHETHER OR NOT THEY REINFORCE THIS PICTURE THAT WE HAVE OF OURSELVES THAT'S WHAT WE LIKE ABOUT OUR FRIENDS TO SARTRA
POD1000000022_S0000125	FOR EXAMPLE IF A BIG PART OF THE WAY THAT YOU VIEW YOURSELF AND YOUR IDENTITY IS THAT YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF TO BE A SMART PERSON SARTRA WOULD PREDICT THAT MOST OF YOUR FRIENDS ARE GOING TO BE PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT SO SMART THAT TELL YOU YOU'RE SMART ALL THE TIME
POD1000000022_S0000126	OR PEOPLE THAT ASK YOU A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT YOU THEN ANSWER MAKING YOU FEEL SMART OR OTHER SMART PEOPLE THAT COMMEND YOU ON BEING SMART LIKE THEM TO SARTRA WE CHOOSE OUR FRIENDS BECAUSE THEY REINFORCE THE WAY THAT WE VIEW OURSELVES
POD1000000022_S0000128	AND OF COURSE IT'S GOING TO FEEL VALIDATING OF COURSE IT WOULD SEEM THAT YOU KNOW BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE WHO YOU ARE BUT AGAIN SARTRA WOULD SAY THAT THE TRUE MEASURE OF YOUR VALUES THE TRUE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION WHO ARE YOU

POD1000000027_S0000287	BECAUSE ON TOP OF DONALD STERLING SAYING ALL THOSE UNFORGIVABLY RACIST THINGS STEIRLING WAS ALSO TAKING SHOTS AT ONE OF THE MOST BELOVED FIGURES IN ALL OF BASKETBALL MAGIC JOHNSON
POD1000000027_S0000289	IT WAS AS SHOCKING AND AS BIZARE AS ANYTHING ON THE TAPE THAT A PICTURE OF VISTIVIANO AND MAGIC JOHNSON HAD SET HIM OFF TO HEAR DONALD STIRLING TALK THAT WAY ABOUT MAGIC

POD1000000027_S0000309	THE TAPES DOMINATED THE NEWS CYCLE NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY WERE JUICY BUT BECAUSE DONALD STIRLING WAS ARTICULATING SOMETHING DEEPER MORE SHAMEFUL
