POD1000000005_S0000007	i have a dream to realize for american dream
POD1000000005_S0000008	after settling in los angeles the korean-born kim did the immigrant hustle
POD1000000005_S0000009	working all kinds of jobs he delivered laundry sold cars finally he landed a gig working in the city's korean-american apparel industry which locals call the jobber market
POD1000000005_S0000010	i have a uncle who has ah one fabric company in korea
POD1000000005_S0000011	he always export fabric to united states
POD1000000005_S0000012	then he recommended to go to the jobber area and get the job in fabric salesforce
POD1000000005_S0000013	so i followed his advice
POD1000000005_S0000014	his uncle's advice paid off kim worked for a decade selling fabric
POD1000000005_S0000015	then in two thousand he and his wife started a garment business of their own
POD1000000005_S0000016	they called it tres bien
POD1000000005_S0000017	and they sold
POD1000000005_S0000018	fashion basic
POD1000000005_S0000019	fashion basic
POD1000000005_S0000020	can wear anytime and anywhere
POD1000000005_S0000021	kim's company sold a bunch of wholesale separates t-shirts sweaters little skirts and such to clothing boutiques
POD1000000005_S0000022	and all of it was made right there in l a's garment district where we visited mr kim in tres bien showroom
POD1000000005_S0000023	i always said to my customer i have a back u s a background made in u s a is that is a brand
POD1000000005_S0000024	in the early days of tres bien when kim and his wife were still chasing their american dream they got an order from a small clothing boutique run by another korean couple
POD1000000005_S0000025	it was called forever twenty-one
POD1000000005_S0000026	kim happily supplied them with clothes until one day
POD1000000005_S0000027	ah they cut me out ah over eighteen years ago
POD1000000005_S0000029	they cut you out
POD1000000005_S0000030	yeah
POD1000000005_S0000031	why
POD1000000005_S0000032	because their business system is not a match with mine
POD1000000005_S0000033	basically here's what went down kim got a complaint from the warehouse that the sleeves on one of the three-quarter tops he sold them were a quarter-inch too long
POD1000000005_S0000034	kim was not down with the critique
POD1000000005_S0000035	i'm not tailor i said i told him i'm not tailor
POD1000000005_S0000036	and you can guess how that went over
POD1000000005_S0000037	he told me that he cannot do business if i said like that
POD1000000005_S0000038	so i say okay let us stop the business oh that's it
POD1000000005_S0000040	had kim known that the company he was mouthing off to would grow to become one of the largest fast-fashion clothing brands in the world perhaps he would've fixed that quarter-inch whoopsies
POD1000000005_S0000041	that little extra bit of sleeve cost him a slice of his american dream
POD1000000005_S0000042	for eighteen years i could not get ah any order
POD1000000005_S0000044	and i regret
POD1000000005_S0000046	did you say you regret
POD1000000005_S0000047	yeah i regret until last year
POD1000000005_S0000049	because the order was huge
POD1000000005_S0000050	a lot of folks from the korean jobber market made a lot of money off of forever twenty-one
POD1000000005_S0000051	the teen brand synonymous with three dollars camisoles nonsensical graphic tees and festival-wear for people who will never make it to coachella
POD1000000005_S0000052	but in the end maybe it's okay that kim didn't hitch his wagon to the clothing giant
POD1000000005_S0000053	forever twenty-one's rise to fast fashion dominance was dizzying
POD1000000005_S0000054	but the brand's unbridled expansion mom-and-pop management approach and weak e-commerce game set it up to fall hard
POD1000000005_S0000055	despite those four ninety-nine leggings
POD1000000005_S0000056	i'm lauren ober and from american public media this is spectacular failures the show that looks cute even though failure's always trying to jack our style
POD1000000005_S0000058	there's a neighborhood in los angeles about three miles west of downtown that is the beating heart of the city's korean community
POD1000000005_S0000059	it's got everything korean karaoke bars and korean barbecue joints boba tea shops and banks
POD1000000005_S0000060	um there's also like beauty treatment beauty makeup the spas
POD1000000005_S0000062	i mean you do have amazing skin
POD1000000005_S0000064	so
POD1000000005_S0000065	i i accept though i'm not sure of it
POD1000000005_S0000066	i came to get a tour of the neighborhood from hyepin im
POD1000000005_S0000067	she's a leader in the korean community here
POD1000000005_S0000068	she runs faith and community empowerment which is a local non-profit
POD1000000005_S0000069	come this way
POD1000000005_S0000071	this neighborhood is by koreans for koreans
POD1000000005_S0000072	though a hefty number of non-koreans come for the aforementioned spas and the k-pop shops and the mouth-numbing kimchi
POD1000000005_S0000073	so it's really for us it's kind of like the ah political social headquarters or center for our community
POD1000000005_S0000074	and also koreatown l a in essence is the headquarter for korean america u s a
POD1000000005_S0000075	los angeles has the largest korean community of any city in the u s
POD1000000005_S0000076	but because of language and cultural barriers im says her community has often felt isolated
POD1000000005_S0000077	this neighborhood though is a homebase
POD1000000005_S0000078	but in essence like as a korean american knowing there's koreatown um and all the people that i've been able to meet because this space allows our communities to come together and to be visible um i don't feel alone
POD1000000005_S0000079	i wanted to better understand how this place with its tight-knit korean churches and its ever-youthful k beauty boutiques birthed one of the largest fast-fashion brands in the world
POD1000000005_S0000081	after the u s and korea established official diplomatic ties in eighteen eighty-two the first wave of korean immigration began to roll in
POD1000000005_S0000082	first to hawaii then to los angeles
POD1000000005_S0000083	it was followed by a second surge after the korean war
POD1000000005_S0000084	the watts riots of nineteen sixty-five pushed a lot of koreans to the l a suburbs
POD1000000005_S0000085	but the number of new arrivals to the city from south korea continued to grow thanks to a loosening of immigration laws
POD1000000005_S0000086	by the time im arrived in the u s in nineteen seventy-four the community was already on the way up
POD1000000005_S0000087	thanks to some hustling by a few local korean businessmen koreatown got its own official blue neighborhood signs in nineteen eighty
POD1000000005_S0000088	so there was kind of that signage
POD1000000005_S0000089	oh although already there was the church and the grocery stores you know started to anchor the rest of the community right um and the restaurants so
POD1000000005_S0000090	just after koreatown became legit a couple named do won and jin sook chang emigrated from seoul
POD1000000005_S0000091	they came in search of the same thing our pal dae jae kim was after the american dream
POD1000000005_S0000092	in south korea mr chang ran a coffee and juice delivery business
POD1000000005_S0000093	mrs chang was a hairdresser when they moved to l a they took a series of menial jobs to make ends meet
POD1000000005_S0000094	mr chang has talked about how he worked as a gas station attendant
POD1000000005_S0000095	he did janitorial work
POD1000000005_S0000096	that's sapna maheshwari she's a business reporter at the new york times
POD1000000005_S0000097	and the legend has it that he was working at a gas station and as he saw people with these really nice cars he would always ask them what they did
POD1000000005_S0000098	and he noticed the people with the nicest cars worked in the garment industry
POD1000000005_S0000099	okay now i would think that the people with the nicest cars in l a were like jack nicholson and mel gibson but what do i know
POD1000000005_S0000100	for some reason the garment trade just became fixed in mr chang's mind so he and his wife went for it
POD1000000005_S0000101	the two of them put together their savings and they decided to open a store that was first called fashion twenty-one
POD1000000005_S0000102	and they figured out what the garment manufacturing in los angeles how to deliver fashions that people wanted and to come up with a way of selling clothes that churned through styles made an exciting environment
POD1000000005_S0000103	and really created the type of place where you had to come in to see what was new
POD1000000005_S0000104	now this might not seem very revolutionary
POD1000000005_S0000105	especially today when consumers can get knock-offs of the latest luxury fashions seemingly before the models have strutted off the catwalk
POD1000000005_S0000106	but in the eighties that wasn't really how fashion was done
POD1000000005_S0000107	they hit on something um as happens in retail they hit upon a formula that resonated with shoppers and they quickly became a success
POD1000000005_S0000108	in nineteen eighty-four the changs opened fashion twenty-one a nine-hundred-square-foot boutique in the heart of the highland park neighborhood
POD1000000005_S0000109	they packed it with cheap skimpy teen clothes that they bought from l a's korean american garment manufacturers like the kind mr kim sold
POD1000000005_S0000110	i think one of the things that definitely helped them was the fact that they were in los angeles and took advantage of the other korean american garment manufacturers in that city specifically
POD1000000005_S0000111	so i think that very much was a propeller of their success
POD1000000005_S0000112	remember the jobber market
POD1000000005_S0000113	jobber j o b b e r jobber market
POD1000000005_S0000114	kim explains that the jobber market came about around thirty-five years ago with the arrival of korean immigrants from south america
POD1000000005_S0000115	he came from bolivia many of the other folks had worked in brazil in that country's massive garment industry and they all brought that experience with them to l a
POD1000000005_S0000116	they bought wholesale closeout garments and went to work opening their own stores
POD1000000005_S0000117	ah people started to sell that merchandise
POD1000000005_S0000118	but the people come from the brazil they started the making manufacturing their own brand apparel
POD1000000005_S0000119	by the time the changs got to l a the korean american apparel industry was already in full swing
POD1000000005_S0000120	the couple worked with manufacturers in the jobber market to fill up fashion twenty-one with inexpensive styles that could be turned over quickly
POD1000000005_S0000122	my producer whitney and i decided to see where it all began
POD1000000005_S0000123	so we took a trip to fifty-six thirty-seven north figueroa street and cruised around the shop for a bit
POD1000000005_S0000125	the sign on the front of the building still reads fashion twenty-one an homage to its humble roots
POD1000000005_S0000126	but it's a forever twenty-one store through and through
POD1000000005_S0000127	see styles from one dollar body suits
POD1000000005_S0000129	bodysuit in there for eight bucks if you want
POD1000000005_S0000130	i've got all the bodysuits i need right now
POD1000000005_S0000131	well that's debatable
POD1000000005_S0000132	we pop inside and it looks pretty classy
POD1000000005_S0000133	like maybe it's more for adults than teens
POD1000000005_S0000134	we head to a rack of graphic tees and i'm kind of into them
POD1000000005_S0000135	i mean i would want one hundred percent wear that actually
POD1000000005_S0000137	bad shirt
POD1000000005_S0000138	if they have that in like a large i would totally wear that
POD1000000005_S0000139	can't stop won't stop
POD1000000005_S0000140	well it's right that's right you can't stop won't stop
POD1000000005_S0000141	alas we left empty-handed no eight dollar bodysuits for whitney
POD1000000005_S0000143	if the fashion twenty-one store on figueroa was representative of what the changs business was in the early days it seems like it would have been a nice little life for them
POD1000000005_S0000144	in its first year the store pulled in seven hundred thousand dollars
POD1000000005_S0000145	and that was largely thanks to other korean immigrants
POD1000000005_S0000146	but then ah they realized how successful this business model was
POD1000000005_S0000147	and they started opening new stores
POD1000000005_S0000148	that's ludovica cesareo she's a marketing professor at lehigh university
POD1000000005_S0000149	they then changed the name to forever twenty-one with the idea that they're selling clothes for anyone who wants to be trendy or fresh or just young ah more generally
POD1000000005_S0000150	this business model selling cheap trendy clothes that could be manufactured quickly and turned over frequently so the stores always felt new and fresh that was the changs secret weapon
POD1000000005_S0000151	today we call this approach fast fashion and lots of global brands do it h and m zara and asos to name a few
POD1000000005_S0000152	but forever twenty-one perfected it
POD1000000005_S0000153	for a definition of fast fashion here's the washington post fashion critic i'm sorry the pulitzer prize-winning fashion critic robin givhan
POD1000000005_S0000154	i mean it's generally clothing that is produced very quickly very much leaping on to a trend of the moment and not meant to last
POD1000000005_S0000155	um ah meaning the design is not meant to last or the clothing is not meant to last
POD1000000005_S0000156	both the idea is that if you want to participate in a trend and a fad and one that is most likely a fleeting fad fast fashion allows you to glom on to that as soon as possible
POD1000000005_S0000157	it allows you to grasp it for minimal cost
POD1000000005_S0000158	wear it a few times
POD1000000005_S0000159	savor the moment literally the moment and then move on
POD1000000005_S0000160	and fast fashion trades in fomo says cesareo
POD1000000005_S0000161	there's this almost fear of missing out ah that if you don't go to the store as soon as the shipment arrives ah you might not be able to find that product in your size
POD1000000005_S0000162	and so it creates this sense of urgency basically in consumers to want to make them keep coming back ah to the store
POD1000000005_S0000163	that and insanely cheap prices
POD1000000005_S0000164	like clothes for under ten dollars a piece
POD1000000005_S0000165	this business model plus a manageable number of stores meant that the chang's operation was profitable and everything was pretty decent
POD1000000005_S0000166	but the changs weren't interested in pretty decent
POD1000000005_S0000167	they were chasing their big bold american dream
POD1000000005_S0000168	i think that mr chang at least in this period where he started expanding into department stores
POD1000000005_S0000169	also thought that forever twenty-one could be more than where college girls got a new outfit for saturday night
POD1000000005_S0000170	he thought that maybe they could be a place where the whole family could be outfitted
POD1000000005_S0000171	where you would really trust this store to provide you with a lot of the clothing for your everyday life
POD1000000005_S0000173	twelve miles from the first forever twenty-one property is the beverly center a sprawling shopping mall that one angeleno told me is quote one of the most hated malls in l a
POD1000000005_S0000174	it's more than eight hundred thousand square feet of prada fendi and balenciaga
POD1000000005_S0000175	tucked into a corner on level eight is x x i forever which i guess is forever twenty-one but make it luxury
POD1000000005_S0000176	the store occupies more than an acre of real estate and is not meant for people over a certain age
POD1000000005_S0000177	it's bright and loud and the seemingly never-ending selection of clothes is disorienting
POD1000000005_S0000178	honestly i felt like i needed a xanax and a nap after we visited
POD1000000005_S0000179	but this was what the changs were after they were planting their flag with huge stores in fancy malls
POD1000000005_S0000180	this was their american dream realized
POD1000000005_S0000181	and they built it largely on top of the ashes of fallen retailers
POD1000000005_S0000182	it was really in the early two thousands that you saw them sort of burst on to the national scene and that really emerged with the acquisition of stores owned by gadzooks
POD1000000005_S0000183	do you remember that retailer
POD1000000005_S0000184	gadzooks was a teen clothing company with hundreds of stores and malls across the u s
POD1000000005_S0000185	in two thousand four it filed for bankruptcy
POD1000000005_S0000186	and so there's all these stores and other assets that were up for purchase and forever twenty-one bid on those successfully
POD1000000005_S0000187	and with that they really expanded their store base and also became a national player in a whole new way
POD1000000005_S0000188	in two thousand five forever twenty-one began a period of mind-blowing expansion
POD1000000005_S0000189	when mall chains like mervyns and sears and others were toppling under their own weight forever twenty-one was snatching up their scraps
POD1000000005_S0000190	when the global recession hit in two thousand eight the changs looked at it as an opportunity to push even harder
POD1000000005_S0000191	nothing like hitting the gas when your competitors are slamming into the guardrails
POD1000000005_S0000192	by twenty-eleven forever twenty-one had almost five hundred stores around the country and employed thirty-five thousand people
POD1000000005_S0000193	within just a few years after that the company had expanded to forty-seven countries
POD1000000005_S0000194	so that meant that tweens in the philippines or romania or macao could all rock a boxy shirred flounce-cuff top or leopard drawstring lounge shorts for less than the price of a movie ticket
POD1000000005_S0000195	twenty-fifteen was forever twenty-one's peak
POD1000000005_S0000196	it did four point four billion dollars in sales that year
POD1000000005_S0000197	which means that they sold a helluva lot of ten dollar minidresses and bralettes and whatever dolphin shorts are
POD1000000005_S0000198	but even though forever twenty-one had grown into a multibillion-dollar business the changs ran it like a mom and pop operation
POD1000000005_S0000199	they owned ninety-nine percent of the company and had never taken on investors which meant that there was and i can't stress this enough no real board of directors they had to run decisions by
POD1000000005_S0000200	or at least not in the traditional sense
POD1000000005_S0000201	the board consisted of mr chang one of his daughters and another forever twenty-one executive
POD1000000005_S0000202	they felt that they were building something of an empire they were in charge mr and mrs chang were in charge and they were going to pass this business on to their daughters
POD1000000005_S0000203	and it was only going to grow and become bigger
POD1000000005_S0000204	the fact that they owned everything also meant that there's not much publicly available information about the company
POD1000000005_S0000205	and the family's not real into talking to the press
POD1000000005_S0000206	they one hundred percent wouldn't talk to us for this story though we did reach out
POD1000000005_S0000207	what we do know is that mr chang oversaw business operations and strategy while mrs chang ran the merchandising side of things one floor below their adult daughters linda and esther served as their deputies
POD1000000005_S0000208	they kind of oversaw their own fiefdoms within the forever twenty-one business
POD1000000005_S0000209	mr chang had to review every single real estate contract um and was involved with the opening of every new store which at the pace that they are expanding is is a huge responsibility
POD1000000005_S0000210	mrs chang had her own hands full
POD1000000005_S0000211	overseeing thousands and thousands of styles and garments and approving each of those individually before they appeared in stores
POD1000000005_S0000212	i mean in many ways it's flabbergasting that these two people could have taken on this amount of responsibility especially at a company of this size
POD1000000005_S0000213	one minute they'd be overseeing new real estate purchases or clothing designs and the next minute they'd be approving expenses for business lunches or ubers
POD1000000005_S0000214	which seems like the very definition of micromanaging
POD1000000005_S0000215	no billionaire c e os are approving timesheets or even what buttons or zippers should be used on new designs
POD1000000005_S0000216	kevin fegans was forever twenty-one's global communications director during the time of the brand's rapid international expansion
POD1000000005_S0000217	he says while having your hand in every pot might not be the most efficient way to run a business it did mean that the changs knew what their brand was all about
POD1000000005_S0000218	well i think the one thing they understood was you know brand personality
POD1000000005_S0000219	so they knew their customer incredibly well so
POD1000000005_S0000220	you know knowing and at least i say that domestically i mean in the u s they knew who she was
POD1000000005_S0000221	um they knew what she liked
POD1000000005_S0000222	they knew you know when she wanted things
POD1000000005_S0000223	so it's like back to school it's christmas
POD1000000005_S0000224	it's it's you know or holiday it's um you know festival season which is huge obviously
POD1000000005_S0000225	while it's important to understand product and who's buying it it's equally important to understand the market you're operating it
POD1000000005_S0000226	i think the challenge with running and operating a global business is that you know seasonalities change
POD1000000005_S0000227	the cultural mindsets change
POD1000000005_S0000228	so you know what the french customer wants the german customer doesn't
POD1000000005_S0000229	you know what and someone in australia is wearing well first of all they're counter-seasonal
POD1000000005_S0000230	so you know um it's when you're shipping that product you can't ship them coats in january right
POD1000000005_S0000231	in forever twenty-one's race to global domination they spread themselves too thin
POD1000000005_S0000232	with nearly eight hundred stores worldwide they couldn't really manage all those physical spaces

POD1000000005_S0000277	in order to better understand how one of the world's biggest fast fashion brands fell apart i decided to go to the source a teen girl
POD1000000005_S0000278	eden goldblum is a sixteen-year-old high school junior who lives just outside of washington d c
POD1000000005_S0000279	she used to shop at forever twenty-one a lot she said until they quote stopped being cute
POD1000000005_S0000280	they're cheap they're not in good shape they break fast and some of them are really tacky
POD1000000005_S0000281	we're on our way to montgomery mall right outside of d c
POD1000000005_S0000282	explain explain what that means to me explain
POD1000000005_S0000283	and you'll see like a normal shirt and then you'll turn around and it says something like weird on it
POD1000000005_S0000285	that's a real disappointment
POD1000000005_S0000286	before i go into the third forever twenty-one of this story i issued a challenge
POD1000000005_S0000287	each of us had to find one cute thing to buy
POD1000000005_S0000288	but after many minutes of browsing the enormous store
POD1000000005_S0000289	i don't think i can do the challenge
POD1000000005_S0000290	i don't think i can do the challenge either
POD1000000005_S0000291	because cause it's overwhelming actually
POD1000000005_S0000292	anything very cute here okay
POD1000000005_S0000293	now it makes sense that i couldn't find anything cute for me
POD1000000005_S0000294	i mean the store isn't called forever forty-one
POD1000000005_S0000295	ah but it should trouble the company that a member of its target demographic can't find anything she likes in this store the size of a mcmansion
POD1000000005_S0000296	okay so basic
POD1000000005_S0000298	it's like a norm it's like a normal material
POD1000000005_S0000299	yeah
POD1000000005_S0000300	finally after some serious hunting eden landed on the one thing in the entire store she would wear
POD1000000005_S0000301	alright
POD1000000005_S0000302	you can hold onto that
POD1000000005_S0000303	alright
POD1000000005_S0000304	then it was up to me to find something i liked
POD1000000005_S0000305	i tried on a crop windbreaker and that went about as well as could be expected
POD1000000005_S0000306	it's very snug around here like is it supposed to fit like this
POD1000000005_S0000308	hey guys i'm just gonna go out for a jog and then i'm gonna go to the i'm gonna go to the club afterwards
POD1000000005_S0000309	finally i landed on my item a plain black baseball cap with the words dangerous but fun written on the crown
POD1000000005_S0000310	dangerous but fun
POD1000000005_S0000311	i'm dangerous but fun
POD1000000005_S0000312	i think you should get that
POD1000000005_S0000313	do you think i should
POD1000000005_S0000314	i think you should
POD1000000005_S0000315	do you think
POD1000000005_S0000316	now i can tell you that i looked neither dangerous nor fun
POD1000000005_S0000317	but i bought the hat and eden bought the little skirt and we both fulfilled our forever twenty-one challenge
POD1000000005_S0000318	great job us
POD1000000005_S0000319	are we dunzo
POD1000000005_S0000320	are we dunzo
POD1000000005_S0000321	do you feel like we're dunzo
POD1000000005_S0000322	i feel like we're dunzo
POD1000000005_S0000323	we were dunzo
POD1000000005_S0000324	i left forever twenty-one fifteen dollars and fifty cents lighter and perhaps more confused than i had been before about how the brand's business model could possibly make sense
POD1000000005_S0000325	there were hardly any shoppers in any of the stores i went to and those who were there seemed more like old millennials than gen z tastemakers
POD1000000005_S0000326	i couldn't figure out what this giant store was all about
POD1000000005_S0000327	or how fast fashion is even supposed to work
POD1000000005_S0000328	i figured robin givhan could help
POD1000000005_S0000329	in addition to reporting on the runways of paris and new york givhan often writes about what fashion says about how we live now
POD1000000005_S0000330	and she thinks a lot about fast fashion and its impact on our culture aesthetically socially and environmentally
POD1000000005_S0000331	surprisingly she isn't totally down on fast fashion
POD1000000005_S0000332	i do think that fast fashion has kind of allowed everyone to have access to aesthetically thoughtful clothing
POD1000000005_S0000333	doesn't mean we're all dressing better though
POD1000000005_S0000334	notice i said to have access to it
POD1000000005_S0000336	in a way givhan says fast fashion is kind of brilliant when it's done right
POD1000000005_S0000337	for the vast majority of people they're not going into the designer boutique
POD1000000005_S0000338	they're going into a department store or a mass merchant
POD1000000005_S0000339	and you know those stores look at trend reports and they look at what's on the runway and part of their great ah skill in both marketing and manufacturing is being able to take those ideas and turn them around at just a rapid fire pace and get them into stores
POD1000000005_S0000340	and there isn't just one delivery that happens at the beginning of a season no no
POD1000000005_S0000341	it's a constant stream of newness
POD1000000005_S0000342	and when and when i say constant i mean like every two weeks for some of these places
POD1000000005_S0000343	so givhan says that at its best fast fashion means that new stylish clothes aren't just for fancies with the cash to shop haute couture
POD1000000005_S0000344	but i'm going to let you in on a little secret
POD1000000005_S0000345	it is impossible for clothing designers to go from original idea to brand spanking new product on the rack in two weeks
POD1000000005_S0000346	especially not at the volume that forever twenty-one needed to fill all of their bazillion stores
POD1000000005_S0000347	so the company had to find some shortcuts
POD1000000005_S0000348	copying other designers ideas was part of forever twenty-one's business model from the beginning
POD1000000005_S0000349	susan scafidi is the founder of the fashion law institute at fordham university and she basically invented the field of fashion law
POD1000000005_S0000350	and she'll be the first one to tell you that while forever twenty-one's practice of copying other designers ideas isn't a cute look it's generally totally legal
POD1000000005_S0000351	fashion is not recognized as an art form in the united states
POD1000000005_S0000352	so it doesn't get copyright protection in large part because a hundred years ago the copyright office decided that fashion no matter how fanciful was utilitarian
POD1000000005_S0000353	only a couple areas of fashion are protected from copying
POD1000000005_S0000354	we have a tiny bit of copyright protection at least since the nineteen sixties for two-dimensional elements of fashion things like fabric prints or lace designs
POD1000000005_S0000355	over on the patent side we've had historically a little bit of protection for some functional elements of fashion things like zippers and velcro and kevlar ah and space suits or hazmat suits
POD1000000005_S0000356	ah and then at the end of the day what fashion really has to rely on is trademark protection
POD1000000005_S0000357	that is protection for the logo or label
POD1000000005_S0000358	so basically the polo pony on your chest or the giant double g on your belt buckle those are protected
POD1000000005_S0000359	the design of the shirt and belt themselves are not original prints are generally also protected
POD1000000005_S0000360	while there aren't a ton of copyright and trademark protections for fashion in the u s
POD1000000005_S0000361	forever twenty-one has still found itself involved in many many many intellectual property lawsuits scafidi says they're one of the most egregious offenders in the game
POD1000000005_S0000362	gucci puma adidas anna sui diane von furstenberg and gwen stefani have all pursued legal action against forever twenty-one alleging various forms of copyright infringement
POD1000000005_S0000363	many smaller brands have also claimed their prints or designs were ripped off by the mega-retailer
POD1000000005_S0000364	but most didn't have the resources to go against a multi-billion dollar mammoth
POD1000000005_S0000365	and scafidi says fast fashion brands like forever twenty-one bank on that
POD1000000005_S0000366	a certain amount of copying is is baked into the business model of every fast fashion company
POD1000000005_S0000367	the only question is how literally they're copying and how much they're changing it up
POD1000000005_S0000368	in forever twenty-one's case they'd often barely bother to change anything about the original design they were ripping off
POD1000000005_S0000369	and some of their fabric prints were just a straight cut and copy job
POD1000000005_S0000370	and maybe on the back end you get caught and have to pay out the occasional settlement ah or or pay some legal fees
POD1000000005_S0000371	but usually that's cheaper ah than actually hiring designers and engaging in innovative product research
POD1000000005_S0000372	copying clothing designs hasn't been forever twenty-one's only questionable move
POD1000000005_S0000373	in two thousand one a workers advocacy center or filed lawsuit on behalf of employees who said they were made to work insane hours for way less than minimum wage
POD1000000005_S0000374	in twenty-twelve the u s department of labor sued the retailer for failing to pay federal minimum wage to its manufacturers and contractors
POD1000000005_S0000375	and in twenty-nineteen pop star ariana grande slapped forever twenty-one with a ten-million-dollar lawsuit
POD1000000005_S0000376	the company used a model in this ad campaign that looks an awful lot like ariana grande
POD1000000005_S0000377	she claims they did this to confuse consumers that she had endorsed them
POD1000000005_S0000378	and that ariana grande lookalike was me just kidding
POD1000000005_S0000379	a behemoth like forever twenty-one rarely fails because of one misstep
POD1000000005_S0000380	how did it falter let us count the ways
POD1000000005_S0000381	how about routine legal troubles leasing too much expensive retail space screwy merchandising that gummed up their supply chain and no traditional board of directors to pump the brakes
POD1000000005_S0000382	and with retail moving more and more online forever twenty-one's weak e-commerce game didn't help matters
POD1000000005_S0000383	in recent years there's been one other major issue tugging at forever twenty-one's flouncy hem sustainability cause sustainable it ain't
POD1000000005_S0000384	i wonder is fast fashion if we're talking about sustainability like is that just as bad as it can get
POD1000000005_S0000385	well i'm i'm hesitant to say the worst but i would be hard-pressed to think of another realm of the fashion industry that is as bad
POD1000000005_S0000386	because fast fashion has as its fundamental purpose
POD1000000005_S0000387	quick disposability
POD1000000005_S0000388	you know the twenty-five dollar handbag that is a knockoff of some you know item that came down the runway
POD1000000005_S0000389	that is really meant to be used for a few months and then you know chucked into the trash well that's gonna end up in a landfill
POD1000000005_S0000390	as opposed to say an hermes handbag that is the price of a small car
POD1000000005_S0000391	that's not getting tossed out
POD1000000005_S0000392	that's going in a safe deposit box as insurance for the apocalypse
POD1000000005_S0000393	sustainability in fashion isn't just about buying more durable classic handbags
POD1000000005_S0000394	the rise of online consignment shopping as well as clothing rental startups like rent the runway means consumers are increasingly trying to buy used and own less stuff
POD1000000005_S0000395	a clothing brand that banks on disposability is not long for this new world
POD1000000005_S0000396	by september twenty-nineteen it had all become just too much for forever twenty-one
POD1000000005_S0000397	the company built by immigrants from a single storefront in l a into a four billion dollar colossus filed for bankruptcy
POD1000000005_S0000398	it's the end of an era
POD1000000005_S0000399	if you're a fan of forever twenty-one you may have to say goodbye to a store near you
POD1000000005_S0000400	over the weekend the retailer filed for chapter eleven bankruptcy all this in hopes of salvaging the company's brand
POD1000000005_S0000401	naturally the internet was a buzz at the news
POD1000000005_S0000402	tons of youtubers raced out to forever twenty-one shops to get some deals deals deals and naturally they made videos
POD1000000005_S0000403	like this one from beauty vlogger lauren giraldo
POD1000000005_S0000404	okay honestly not gonna lie i was expecting things to look different and the first one i thought it was gonna be like everything must go signs and stuff you know
POD1000000005_S0000405	i mean i feel like you can tell what i was expecting but a little bit of it seems like business is usual
POD1000000005_S0000406	so i'm like hello are the headlines like do they mean any i don't know let's go in and see if we can get some bankrupt deals or not
POD1000000005_S0000407	let's just go see what the d is
POD1000000005_S0000408	f y i she didn't actually buy anything at forever twenty-one
POD1000000005_S0000409	but she did put together some looks and filmed herself wearing them the dressing room so close enough
POD1000000005_S0000410	deals are great and all
POD1000000005_S0000411	but forever twenty-one's former global communications director kevin fegans said the bankruptcy news felt like a surprise gut punch even though he had already left the company
POD1000000005_S0000412	i really wasn't aware of the challenges
POD1000000005_S0000413	i mean i would hear obviously and you'd kind of think that certain markets weren't doing well and maybe we needed to kind of push or help promote in those markets
POD1000000005_S0000414	i e kind of drive more p r see how we can kind of you know um increase foot traffic but never was i aware that things were really kind of starting to um come to a halt or at least you know where bankruptcy was gonna be in the in the foreseeable future
POD1000000005_S0000415	its chapter eleven filing really leaned into the changs immigrant story
POD1000000005_S0000416	under the subheading forever dreaming a roadmap to the american dream it read forever twenty-one is a story about family and the american dream
POD1000000005_S0000417	in an age when retail as most americans know it is under assault forever twenty-one intends to use these proceedings to remain viable and write a different ending from so many retail companies before it
POD1000000005_S0000418	the goal of these chapter eleven cases is clear emerge with a viable and feasible standalone business and keep the dream alive
POD1000000005_S0000419	as a part of its restructuring plan the company announced that it intended to streamline its retail operation pump up its e-commerce game and shut down a whole lot of stores
POD1000000005_S0000420	nearly all of its international locations and more than one hundred underperforming u s stores were on the chopping block
POD1000000005_S0000421	that's more than forty percent of their physical retail locations
POD1000000005_S0000422	but those plans were all for naught
POD1000000005_S0000423	in february a group of buyers including some of forever twenty-one's biggest landlords put in an offer to buy the brand for the bargain-basement price of eighty-one million dollars
POD1000000005_S0000424	a judge approved the deal and boom
POD1000000005_S0000425	clothing retailer forever twenty-one has been sold after declaring bankruptcy late last year

POD1000000011_S0000000	aha greetings class and welcome to counting school where what you learn really counts
POD1000000011_S0000001	so we want to start today with a little story about an old friend from sesame street
POD1000000011_S0000002	i am your teacher the count you know why they call me the count
POD1000000011_S0000003	because you love to count things
POD1000000011_S0000004	i love the count ah and ken scarborough knows him really well because he's head writer at sesame street
POD1000000011_S0000005	his whole identity is wrapped up in being the count and being a guy who knows his numbers really well
POD1000000011_S0000006	now of course for the count that we all know and love numbers give him nothing but joy
POD1000000011_S0000007	nine nine sandwiches all together
POD1000000011_S0000009	but on this one day it's different
POD1000000011_S0000010	the count makes a mistake and he's sort of cannot believe it he's crushed
POD1000000011_S0000012	what number did he forget
POD1000000011_S0000013	well somebody interrupted him it's really not his fault he he was counting sandwiches he was really being helpful
POD1000000011_S0000014	nine sandwiches are you sure count
POD1000000011_S0000015	oh but of course i am sure chris i am the count
POD1000000011_S0000016	aha
POD1000000011_S0000017	ah the count
POD1000000011_S0000018	hm
POD1000000011_S0000020	elmo thinks the count made a little mistake
POD1000000011_S0000021	ah a mistake
POD1000000011_S0000022	ah huh yeah see
POD1000000011_S0000023	it really struck him to his his core he decided he wasn't gonna be the count anymore
POD1000000011_S0000024	wow so the count screws up he makes a mistake
POD1000000011_S0000025	yeah and he couldn't get over it
POD1000000011_S0000026	and you know what cory that means he's pretty similar to you and me
POD1000000011_S0000027	yeah because math anxiety is a real thing
POD1000000011_S0000029	estimates range up to ninety-three percent of american adults that's a lot cory
POD1000000011_S0000030	yeah i don't even need to know any math to know that that is a lot
POD1000000011_S0000031	yeah ninety-three percent of american adults feel some degree of anxiety that is specific to math
POD1000000011_S0000032	so if you avoid doing your budget or investing well we got a life kit for that
POD1000000011_S0000033	yeah
POD1000000011_S0000034	but also math anxiety could be part of the reason why
POD1000000011_S0000035	oh what should elmo and the count do next the count
POD1000000011_S0000037	nothing
POD1000000011_S0000038	ah
POD1000000011_S0000039	nada zero zilch i shall never count again
POD1000000011_S0000040	what
POD1000000011_S0000041	and the count's not alone on tests math anxiety can cause students to perform as though they were a whole year behind in school
POD1000000011_S0000042	yeah obviously this is a real problem for schools and for how we teach math but what can we as parents do to shape our kids attitude towards math
POD1000000011_S0000043	we sat down with rosemarie truglio
POD1000000011_S0000044	math is everywhere
POD1000000011_S0000045	she's a senior vice president of curriculum and content at sesame workshop and i put the problem to her this way
POD1000000011_S0000046	i feel like as a parent i understand pretty well how to promote early literacy
POD1000000011_S0000048	reading bedtime stories supposed to be singing the alphabet song
POD1000000011_S0000049	but when i think about the equivalent on the math side of things i just draw a blank
POD1000000011_S0000050	and i want you guys to help me fill in that blank what does it mean to promote the love of math early on
POD1000000011_S0000051	you're saying that we have to get them to love math they already love math
POD1000000011_S0000052	what
POD1000000011_S0000053	yes they're not coming into this world not liking math
POD1000000011_S0000055	so let's figure out if we can solve this little math equation here
POD1000000011_S0000056	you're listening to n p r's life kit for parenting with sesame workshop i'm anya kamenetz i'm not afraid of a corny joke
POD1000000011_S0000057	i'm cory turner and after the break we're gonna give you some tips that you can use starting in the early years
POD1000000011_S0000058	but also strategies you can keep returning to even when you're a grown up and no matter how old your kids are as well as what to never ever say to your kids about math

POD1000000011_S0000065	you're listening to life kit for parenting with sesame workshop in this episode we're gonna do the equivalent of flipping to the back of the book to look right at the answers
POD1000000011_S0000066	yep
POD1000000011_S0000067	because we know that by listening to this math episode you had to overcome some anxieties i bet of your own
POD1000000011_S0000068	yes so let's get right to our takeaways and number one don't let your math anxiety hold your kids back
POD1000000011_S0000069	math anxiety as we mentioned is a real phenomenon all over the world
POD1000000011_S0000070	yeah and it's pretty clearly related to how we teach math in school things like timed practice and memorization and high-stakes testing and oh my gosh i'm getting hot flashes and sweaty palms just thinking about fact tests
POD1000000011_S0000071	ugh
POD1000000011_S0000072	and here's the really upsetting thing is that math anxiety it's not equal opportunity
POD1000000011_S0000073	that's right it's tied to stereotypes race and especially gender research shows that mothers and preschool teachers who are overwhelmingly women they can pass that feeling onto their kids especially to their girls
POD1000000011_S0000074	but there is some good news
POD1000000011_S0000075	children are not born with math anxiety all right it's passed on to them so i think that's why we have to check ourselves
POD1000000011_S0000076	in when we're talking about math
POD1000000011_S0000077	this was kind of a surprise for me because i thought that you know if my kid had a problem with math i could bond with him by saying hey you know it was tough for me too
POD1000000011_S0000078	but actually rosemarie says
POD1000000011_S0000079	saying i don't like math i can't do math that will get conveyed to your children
POD1000000011_S0000080	and the solution instead we need to reframe math
POD1000000011_S0000081	yeah rosemarie says think about the fun activities that can back up and reinforce what they're learning in school
POD1000000011_S0000082	math is very much an integral part of your life do you love music
POD1000000011_S0000083	i do i love to sing
POD1000000011_S0000084	all right if you love music then you love math do you like to cook and bake
POD1000000011_S0000085	i love to cook and bake
POD1000000011_S0000086	okay then you love math because you can't do music and you can't cook and bake without math
POD1000000011_S0000087	so i can't cook or bake really and i definitely cannot sing but i love baseball for example and my boys and i we talk about baseball statistics all the time
POD1000000011_S0000088	so what's important rosemarie says is recognizing math as part of many things that we like doing together
POD1000000011_S0000089	exactly and so to see more about how adults can weave math into our everyday moments of life even with really little kids you and i and our producer lauren migaki visited a really special preschool
POD1000000011_S0000091	they came to watch us play today
POD1000000011_S0000092	hi
POD1000000011_S0000093	this is the center for early childhood education it's our research preschool at eastern connecticut state university the lobby has this giant super realistic oak tree
POD1000000011_S0000094	yeah which um i climbed inside very cool
POD1000000011_S0000095	nice to see you good morning
POD1000000011_S0000096	we should also say anya about a third of the kids at this school speak spanish at home
POD1000000011_S0000097	that's right and at the preschool we sat down with one of the lead researchers sudha swaminathan and she helped us understand a lot more about how to grow children who love math
POD1000000011_S0000098	the minute we say math we try to think of the big picture you know big old theorems big old geometry concepts
POD1000000011_S0000099	instead swaminathan says think small she's a professor in early childhood education at eastern connecticut state and her special focus is on early math learning
POD1000000011_S0000100	and sudha and her colleagues have done lots of research to see what kinds of childhood experiences lead to better performance in math later on
POD1000000011_S0000101	and one of their answers makes up our second takeaway takeaway number two
POD1000000011_S0000102	talk about math take this really ordinary moment
POD1000000011_S0000103	you ask them to put their books away and then say it doesn't fit in the shelf so why doesn't it fit
POD1000000011_S0000104	maybe it's the book is too tall too big
POD1000000011_S0000105	sudha says you're actually talking about a math process it's problem-solving
POD1000000011_S0000106	yeah and we heard lots of this by the way math talk at the preschool
POD1000000011_S0000108	does the duck fit in there too um he didn't fit when he was standing up
POD1000000011_S0000109	so you decided to lay him down does he fit now
POD1000000011_S0000110	that's amie lopez the lead teacher for the toddler classroom
POD1000000011_S0000111	it's a sunny room with a cozy reading corner there's a play kitchen and blocks
POD1000000011_S0000112	and near the center the room there's this table and amie's sitting with the children they're building together with magna-tiles which are these colorful plastic blocks with different shapes that stick together
POD1000000011_S0000113	and they also have little plastic farm animals and one of the kids is kind of putting together a house
POD1000000011_S0000114	now you're using triangles and squares
POD1000000011_S0000116	naming the shapes in both english and in spanish when we played this tape for rosemarie she said
POD1000000011_S0000117	what i heard there is the teacher using descriptive math language and that is so key for children to understand math concepts
POD1000000011_S0000118	you can't understand the concepts without the language
POD1000000011_S0000119	yeah and amie's not building the blocks for the kids she's actually making observations and kind of like narrating their thoughts in real time
POD1000000011_S0000120	the more blocks you add the longer it gets kohen i noticed that when you added more your line gotten longer and longer
POD1000000011_S0000121	when she said more blocks to make it longer i mean longer is a complex word for children
POD1000000011_S0000122	and they need to hear that language and they need to hear that language in a very concrete way
POD1000000011_S0000123	she wasn't even afraid to use really technical words like when this little boy was trying to make his little corral stand up
POD1000000011_S0000124	now you can put them all around the perimeter all around the edge
POD1000000011_S0000125	perimeter
POD1000000011_S0000126	yeah
POD1000000011_S0000127	another great occasion to talk math as rosemarie said earlier is in music class
POD1000000011_S0000128	i'm going to give everybody two rhythm sticks one for each hand we have smooth rhythm sticks
POD1000000011_S0000129	do you want to touch it
POD1000000011_S0000131	feel
POD1000000011_S0000132	that
POD1000000011_S0000133	yep and
POD1000000011_S0000135	you probably remember the kind cory they're perfect for hitting your friends
POD1000000011_S0000136	yeah
POD1000000011_S0000137	do we tap them on our friends
POD1000000011_S0000138	no
POD1000000011_S0000139	do we bang them on the floor
POD1000000011_S0000140	no
POD1000000011_S0000141	what could happen
POD1000000011_S0000142	and after this moment the children practice going faster
POD1000000011_S0000144	and then they go slow
POD1000000011_S0000145	one
POD1000000011_S0000147	faster and slower are relational concepts these are math words related to rhythm
POD1000000011_S0000148	so when we were talking to rosemarie i had an epiphany anya that my all-time favorite sesame street moment
POD1000000011_S0000149	and i watched a lot of sesame as a kid
POD1000000011_S0000150	that's not obvious
POD1000000011_S0000152	it was a math moment and it's with my favorite character grover
POD1000000011_S0000153	um um
POD1000000011_S0000154	and he's so he's standing there in the foreground and he says near
POD1000000011_S0000155	ah huh
POD1000000011_S0000156	and then he goes way back here
POD1000000011_S0000158	far
POD1000000011_S0000160	near
POD1000000011_S0000162	far epiphany
POD1000000011_S0000164	so the point is parents get approximately one million billion chances all day long every day every night to talk about math
POD1000000011_S0000165	that is of course a rough estimate but think about it
POD1000000011_S0000166	there are calendars and clocks money maps measuring crafts
POD1000000011_S0000167	it's very broad and i think that once parents understand the breadth of how we define math and how they are already doing it they go oh that's math
POD1000000011_S0000168	i didn't realize that was math oh if that's math then i could do that
POD1000000011_S0000169	setting the table one-to-one correspondence that's math ordinal number first second third that's math
POD1000000011_S0000170	yeah and if you need even more chances roll the dice on our next takeaway takeaway number three
POD1000000011_S0000171	play math
POD1000000011_S0000172	find ways to keep math in mind when you're playing with your kids sudha says you may already be doing this
POD1000000011_S0000173	just play
POD1000000011_S0000174	and research has shown that when parents just play they're actually really really good at pulling out these deep concepts from children much better than even teachers
POD1000000011_S0000175	there's so many ways to play math with kids of all different ages
POD1000000011_S0000176	right there are puzzles of course and blocks like we heard with amie
POD1000000011_S0000177	there's video games and apps card games and especially board games
POD1000000011_S0000178	research has shown that the more kids play any game with dice and numbered squares the better their basic math skills get
POD1000000011_S0000179	you can even play math outside
POD1000000011_S0000180	i can give a big push to the swing or i can hop three times to go there
POD1000000011_S0000181	at sudha's house hopscotch had negative one
POD1000000011_S0000183	which is kind of mind-blowing to me
POD1000000011_S0000184	yeah
POD1000000011_S0000185	um and she says you know play can be the foundation even of advanced subjects like algebra
POD1000000011_S0000186	algebra is you know of all the math concepts algebra seems to ah shake many people's nerves
POD1000000011_S0000187	but what is algebra really if you think about it
POD1000000011_S0000188	it is recognizing that there are patterns in numbers there are patterns in um equations and you know you're you you're trying to balance the two sides of it
POD1000000011_S0000189	take this little moment in amie lopez's toddler room
POD1000000011_S0000190	when you put your triangles together it makes a square look
POD1000000011_S0000191	same same
POD1000000011_S0000192	same same they match
POD1000000011_S0000194	just like that one you made one that is the same great discovery
POD1000000011_S0000195	same same
POD1000000011_S0000196	exactly so as you know cory i have a two-year-old at home and i was getting so excited at this point
POD1000000011_S0000197	because i felt like hey i'm ready to be the a plus a p extra-credit mom
POD1000000011_S0000198	but narrate every moment of block time i'm gonna use perimeter and quadrado
POD1000000011_S0000199	rein it in kamenetz
POD1000000011_S0000200	ah what
POD1000000011_S0000201	come on i'm raring to go let's get those flash cards come on
POD1000000011_S0000203	remember sudha warned us
POD1000000011_S0000204	um and this really rings true for me
POD1000000011_S0000205	one thing i would tell parents not to do is to become the teacher in the house
POD1000000011_S0000206	ah um all right
POD1000000011_S0000207	i i get this
POD1000000011_S0000208	yeah i mean for one thing it's it's kind of annoying
POD1000000011_S0000209	you know when we play with our friends we're not constantly asking them let's count how many there is this what does this shape we don't do that
POD1000000011_S0000210	she doesn't know what i do with my friends i i might quiz my friends
POD1000000011_S0000212	i don't wanna hang out with you
POD1000000011_S0000213	oh fine
POD1000000011_S0000214	all right the most important reason to not be so heavy-handed when we're playing with our kids is takeaway number four
POD1000000011_S0000215	math like life is so much more interesting and fun when we can get beyond right and wrong answers
POD1000000011_S0000216	for example sudha said this
POD1000000011_S0000217	we are sitting at a round table and i could ask you anya what's the shape of this table
POD1000000011_S0000218	i know it's a circle you know it
POD1000000011_S0000219	i mean so it's but a better question would be to say anya why did you choose the circle for our table
POD1000000011_S0000220	that is better because she's actually interested in my answer she doesn't know what i going to say
POD1000000011_S0000221	i don't know why you did that right but that gets us talking about shapes
POD1000000011_S0000222	it's a real conversation
POD1000000011_S0000223	yes and it's the kind of conversation that you could have with kids at almost any age
POD1000000011_S0000224	or another interesting question sudha says might be how do you know the table is round
POD1000000011_S0000225	it's going to make them look at that circle one more time and to see that you know this it feels um curvy and the other one feels sharp on the edge
POD1000000011_S0000226	so the key here is to keep things open-ended
POD1000000011_S0000227	so we saw another great example of this in other preschool classrooms there was a four-year-old boy named achilles kind of messing around with some blocks
POD1000000011_S0000228	and the teacher karla alamo was a master she just backed off and let him do his thing because you know what he's doing
POD1000000011_S0000229	he's he's trying things out he's testing out hypotheses
POD1000000011_S0000230	this is data it's probability
POD1000000011_S0000231	it's not about getting to a certain place in the end
POD1000000011_S0000232	do you want the wheel to go under it or over it
POD1000000011_S0000233	over
POD1000000011_S0000234	over it
POD1000000011_S0000235	yeah and remember this is play it's open-ended
POD1000000011_S0000236	there's no right or wrong she's letting him figure it out
POD1000000011_S0000237	do we need to ah change any blocks or add anything to make it jump higher
POD1000000011_S0000239	and rosemarie says there's a social and emotional point we're making that goes deeper even than the math here
POD1000000011_S0000240	there should be no fear in making a mistake
POD1000000011_S0000241	let's say that again no fear in making a mistake
POD1000000011_S0000242	that's basically how children learn it's all trial and error for them
POD1000000011_S0000243	and they're also looking to us how we react to making a mistake and that's part of resiliency
POD1000000011_S0000244	and it's really helpful to communicate this attitude when our kids are a little older like mine are and they're learning math in school on somebody else's schedule
POD1000000011_S0000245	yeah i mean the pressure just gets higher from year to year and so the most helpful that we can be as parents is not to be frog-marching them through their homework but try to make it feel okay to mess up sometimes and also to keep going
POD1000000011_S0000246	because it's all part of the process
POD1000000011_S0000247	yeah failure is important which is a lesson the count had to learn
POD1000000011_S0000248	oh i cannot believe it i the count made a counting mistake
POD1000000011_S0000249	well just a little one oh the count
POD1000000011_S0000250	so ah as we said in the beginning you know he messed up it wasn't his fault
POD1000000011_S0000251	he decides to quit being the count
POD1000000011_S0000252	yeah and he goes in search of other employment
POD1000000011_S0000253	all right construction worker all right we're gonna have to hammer five nails into this here beam
POD1000000011_S0000254	all right
POD1000000011_S0000255	it turns out there's things you've got to count um um in doing construction and measuring and all this kind of stuff so there's no escaping at there
POD1000000011_S0000256	again this ken scarborough the head writer at sesame
POD1000000011_S0000257	so he left that he became a rocket guy there have to count down
POD1000000011_S0000258	ten oh nine eight
POD1000000011_S0000260	and what finally gets the count back on track is actually another mistake
POD1000000011_S0000261	yeah his friend elmo steps in and pretends to mess up his own counting just to help the count know that it's okay to mess up
POD1000000011_S0000262	five six seven eight nine
POD1000000011_S0000263	but i need ten carrots
POD1000000011_S0000264	wait the i believe you made a mistake elmo
POD1000000011_S0000265	oh a mistake
POD1000000011_S0000266	yes you said four twice ah you should count the carrots again
POD1000000011_S0000267	oh elmo can't do that to count elmo made a mistake so elmo's gonna give up counting
POD1000000011_S0000268	give up
POD1000000011_S0000269	give up
POD1000000011_S0000270	no no no no elmo no elmo everybody makes mistake
POD1000000011_S0000271	you cannot give up ah the important thing is to keep trying
POD1000000011_S0000272	sudha actually told us this is a good tip for parents to try too you can make a mistake and give your kids a chance to correct you with math or you know anything else
POD1000000011_S0000273	i did give up but i shouldn't have i i must keep trying and you should too
POD1000000011_S0000274	yeah
POD1000000011_S0000275	so come let's count the carrots together
POD1000000011_S0000276	cool
POD1000000011_S0000278	one carrot
POD1000000011_S0000279	and just the way elmo did you can build up their confidence
POD1000000011_S0000280	nine
POD1000000011_S0000281	ten carrots altogether
POD1000000011_S0000283	so we started off this episode talking about a topic that i don't particularly love math but we ended up somewhere really great cory
POD1000000011_S0000284	because i feel like all of a sudden i realized that through exploring the world with my kid i can spark my curiosity i can look at stuff with new eyes
POD1000000011_S0000285	and i can go back and get a redo on something that wasn't so fun for me when i was a kid
POD1000000011_S0000286	yeah and i got to do my grover impression
POD1000000011_S0000288	great same same even steven
POD1000000011_S0000289	same same all right time for recap
POD1000000011_S0000290	we got to go through all our takeaways but gosh i ah i can't i can't remember how many we had um
POD1000000011_S0000291	anya do you remember
POD1000000011_S0000292	no i don't think i remember can maybe we can get some help

POD1000000011_S0000298	all right so takeaway number one don't let your math anxiety hold your kids back
POD1000000011_S0000299	yeah find math in everyday activities that you enjoy together
POD1000000011_S0000300	takeaway number two talk math
POD1000000011_S0000301	yeah triangle square perimeter near far up down longer shorter
POD1000000011_S0000302	faster slower
POD1000000011_S0000304	they're all talking math takeaway number three
POD1000000011_S0000305	play math
POD1000000011_S0000306	chutes and ladders
POD1000000011_S0000307	candyland
POD1000000011_S0000308	puzzles
POD1000000011_S0000309	books
POD1000000011_S0000310	hopscotch on the playground these are all ways to practice numbers shapes problem-solving
POD1000000011_S0000311	even probability and algebra and takeaway number four let's stay away from the right and wrong answers
POD1000000011_S0000312	keep things open-ended
POD1000000011_S0000313	because math like life is so much more fun and interesting that way and so you know what

POD1000000012_S0000055	yeah
POD1000000012_S0000056	um how can we distract ourselves so we're not gonna focus on these cookies right now
POD1000000012_S0000058	how about we start with some nice deep belly breathing
POD1000000012_S0000059	oh me know that one

POD1000000012_S0000068	how about that
POD1000000012_S0000069	cookie that's a great idea and a great strategy we're gonna turn our backs on these cookies so we're not gonna see them

POD1000000012_S0000103	let's take a quick break and when we come back more on the science and the art of self-regulation

POD1000000012_S0000110	and i'm anya
POD1000000012_S0000111	and we're gonna finish our convo with cookie monster in just a few minutes
POD1000000012_S0000112	but first we should acknowledge it's pretty surprising that cookie's become so skilled at self-regulation
POD1000000012_S0000113	so i remember as a child watching cookie monster and just being like what is wrong with this maniac
POD1000000012_S0000115	that's kentaro fujita an expert on self-regulation who we'll talk to in a bit
POD1000000012_S0000116	and yeah i have to agree anya the cookie we grew up with
POD1000000012_S0000117	cowabunga
POD1000000012_S0000119	was pure
POD1000000012_S0000121	cookie
POD1000000012_S0000123	cookie
POD1000000012_S0000125	but rosemarie from sesame says cookie's transformation was actually really really intentional
POD1000000012_S0000126	sesame street every year we focus on a critical educational need in children's lives
POD1000000012_S0000127	and it was about seven eight years ago when all of this research started to come out ah showing the importance of the self-regulation skills and how they were related to school achievement school readiness and life lessons
POD1000000012_S0000129	and that is exactly why we're gonna be talking about this today
POD1000000012_S0000130	yeah and sesame decided once they knew all of this the cookie monster was the perfect muppet to send this message
POD1000000012_S0000131	let's not define him as this impulsive character who has no self-control because he can have self-control
POD1000000012_S0000132	so after
POD1000000012_S0000134	three years
POD1000000012_S0000135	cookie evolves
POD1000000012_S0000136	yes
POD1000000012_S0000137	and he becomes someone who what
POD1000000012_S0000138	it's much more reflective who can actually stop and pause and control his emotion and his desire for eating the cookie right away
POD1000000012_S0000139	that's inspiring rosemarie
POD1000000012_S0000140	yes it is
POD1000000012_S0000142	yeah it's inspiring for me as a forty-two-year-old that i have one more year to get all my self-control together
POD1000000012_S0000143	i believe in you
POD1000000012_S0000144	well well thank you very much ah sesame's hope here was
POD1000000012_S0000145	that we could model the strategies for children to learn and apply the strategies and build their own self-regulation toolbox
POD1000000012_S0000146	and several years ago sesame backed a study to see if this could really work
POD1000000012_S0000147	and so some of the kids in the study watched videos of cookie monster practicing the strategies kind of like you heard at the top of the podcast
POD1000000012_S0000148	me got new strategy
POD1000000012_S0000150	then rosemarie says the researcher tempted all the kids with their favorite snack
POD1000000012_S0000151	chocolate chippies
POD1000000012_S0000153	and the kids who watched cookie monster
POD1000000012_S0000154	on average waited four additional minutes
POD1000000012_S0000155	four minutes that is huge for a preschooler
POD1000000012_S0000156	huge
POD1000000012_S0000158	so let's break this down for a minute
POD1000000012_S0000159	yeah
POD1000000012_S0000160	what does not eating cookies have to do with being successful in school or in your life
POD1000000012_S0000161	rosemarie explained that self-regulation isn't just about treats ah ha self-regulation is a set of skills that helps us reach our goals
POD1000000012_S0000162	specifically we need to either monitor or change or redirect our thoughts feelings and behavior toward a particular goal that we've chosen
POD1000000012_S0000163	yeah and within self-regulation you're gonna hear us talk a lot in this episode specifically about self-control which is either resisting an impulse or overcoming a temptation on the way to a goal
POD1000000012_S0000164	so self-control means more than resisting a cookie
POD1000000012_S0000165	it means not hitting a classmate on the playground when he takes your tricycle
POD1000000012_S0000166	it means working through your math homework and not throwing a tantrum when you get stumped
POD1000000012_S0000167	yeah it can even mean working through a big fear that you have when it overwhelms you
POD1000000012_S0000168	and all of this is a big deal right now not only because of the new research that rosemarie referenced but also because there's just more and more kids out there with diagnosed issues that can interfere with the development of self-regulation
POD1000000012_S0000169	things like childhood trauma a d h d or being on the autism spectrum
POD1000000012_S0000170	also many parents especially privileged parents are basically stepping into their kids lives to smooth over their kids paths and remove any sources of frustration really before their kids have a chance to learn how to deal with it
POD1000000012_S0000171	i don't know what you're talking about cory
POD1000000012_S0000172	i appreciate your honesty
POD1000000012_S0000173	i mean i i can see that this is very well-meaning and a lot of parents just want the best for their kids in a really competitive world
POD1000000012_S0000174	but what we're doing also deprives them of the natural opportunities that they might have to learn self-regulation along the way
POD1000000012_S0000175	and that's what's going on in in in children's lives right now that they are becoming risk-averse
POD1000000012_S0000176	they want everything done for them
POD1000000012_S0000177	and so sesame decided to send the message that you know if cookie monster can learn to control himself anybody can
POD1000000012_S0000178	but i was kind of skeptical cory i wanted to learn more about the science of this right
POD1000000012_S0000179	because obviously i see that my kids as they grow up they get better self-regulation my two-year-old is not as good at waiting as my seven-year-old
POD1000000012_S0000180	right
POD1000000012_S0000181	um so you know is this really something i need to coach my kids on is this like do i just send them to self-control summer camp
POD1000000012_S0000183	yes and no
POD1000000012_S0000184	ah some of the variation is genetic and and you're right that children's brains do naturally develop along these lines
POD1000000012_S0000185	but ken fujita who we heard from earlier who said cookie monster was a maniac
POD1000000012_S0000186	yeah
POD1000000012_S0000187	um he happens to be a professor psychology at the ohio state university and he describes it this way
POD1000000012_S0000188	so the brain and you can think of as being like the hardware
POD1000000012_S0000189	but even when we have the hardware we still need to learn how to use the hardware with the right software
POD1000000012_S0000190	so by software ken's talking about the skills and the strategies that parents can help kids practice to improve their self-regulation
POD1000000012_S0000191	exactly
POD1000000012_S0000192	there is a lot of research supporting very specific interventions so without making everybody wait any longer let's open up the toolbox and get right to our takeaways
POD1000000012_S0000194	all right and takeaway number one is big picture advice for us parents
POD1000000012_S0000196	we need to start thinking of self-regulation as a skill to be practiced
POD1000000012_S0000197	exactly
POD1000000012_S0000198	so this part made me think about when my husband was teaching our older daughter lulu to ski right
POD1000000012_S0000199	so first she was kind of freaked out the mountain is right big
POD1000000012_S0000200	she is small it is cold
POD1000000012_S0000201	and he had to begin by really acknowledging all of the big feelings that she was having and rosemarie says we should do the same thing when we're working on a skill
POD1000000012_S0000202	you need to validate children's emotions i know it's hard
POD1000000012_S0000203	i know it's hard the worst thing to be is like you know oh it's easy don't worry it is so no
POD1000000012_S0000204	so you've done that empathizing and then you have to move on to the nuts and bolts
POD1000000012_S0000205	what is it that you actually do you know you don't just tell the kid ski down the hill and you don't just tell a kid control yourself
POD1000000012_S0000206	yeah don't don't throw a tantrum
POD1000000012_S0000207	right
POD1000000012_S0000208	that doesn't work you can't do it that way
POD1000000012_S0000209	so when you're skiing you break down the skill into tiny pieces and there are strategies that you can use for each one
POD1000000012_S0000210	for example when you want to slow down you point the skis toward each other and ah the code word for that is pizza okay
POD1000000012_S0000211	like it's it's a slice of pizza the two skis coming together
POD1000000012_S0000212	thank you life kit skiing
POD1000000012_S0000213	yes now and the analogy here is we're taking self-regulation or self-control these big big concepts and we're breaking them down into very specific strategies that we want our kids to try
POD1000000012_S0000214	right and the other key thing to remember is that our kids are gonna fail and probably fail a lot
POD1000000012_S0000215	yeah
POD1000000012_S0000216	before they succeed and and we really have to not only accept that failure but praise their effort every chance we get
POD1000000012_S0000217	so even if it is i just waited a minute praise the effort i waited a minute
POD1000000012_S0000218	yeah and next time maybe they'll wait two minutes
POD1000000012_S0000219	totally and here's the thing i mean obviously not every kid needs to learn to ski but every kid needs to learn to regulate their emotions
POD1000000012_S0000220	and they can as long as they have a coach
POD1000000012_S0000221	yeah so let's let's look at self-control again what is the first step to not hitting your friend or not throwing your homework across the room
POD1000000012_S0000222	tying your hands behind your back
POD1000000012_S0000224	a better way is not getting so mad in the first place
POD1000000012_S0000225	and that's why we need to start here when it comes to teaching our kids to regulate their emotions because it's self-regulation right
POD1000000012_S0000226	so takeaway number two yelling calm down at your kids when they get really worked up that doesn't work
POD1000000012_S0000227	yeah i know this because i've tried it
POD1000000012_S0000229	i have tried it too many times
POD1000000012_S0000230	i mean it's just really common to respond to our kids frustration with our own frustration
POD1000000012_S0000231	but there is something that can help both of us as long as we're consistent both our kids and ourselves and that is our slow deep breathing
POD1000000012_S0000232	belly breathing comes in so taking those deep slow breaths in and out
POD1000000012_S0000234	just like i did with cookie monster i know it was silly and probably sounded a little ridiculous
POD1000000012_S0000235	but it works i do it at home i do it at work
POD1000000012_S0000236	you can ask all of the life kit producers it works
POD1000000012_S0000237	and it's important to make it a habit
POD1000000012_S0000238	and you know what that's not all cory
POD1000000012_S0000239	you can teach your kid to hug a pillow or a stuffed animal to calm down you can also try this craft
POD1000000012_S0000240	okay take a jar fill it with glue water and glitter
POD1000000012_S0000241	and then make sure you screw the lid on really tight that's important
POD1000000012_S0000243	and whenever they're feeling stressed out you can tell your kids to give that jar a shake
POD1000000012_S0000244	i know i'm overwhelmed right now but let me just breathe and focus on how that glitter is swirling around which represents my feelings right now
POD1000000012_S0000245	but if i belly breathe and watch the glitter settle it gives me the time to calm down
POD1000000012_S0000247	all right so belly breathing glitter jars our next takeaway zeros in very specifically on self-control
POD1000000012_S0000248	that's right takeaway number three pretend the cookie is plastic
POD1000000012_S0000250	all right yeah so you've probably heard of the marshmallow test
POD1000000012_S0000251	it was a famous study that was done where children were offered a marshmallow to eat
POD1000000012_S0000252	and they were told they could eat it right away but if they waited they could have two of the treats later
POD1000000012_S0000253	yeah so this study is so famous if you just go to youtube and type in marshmallow test you'll find all kinds of videos of kids being subjected to this sort of torment
POD1000000012_S0000254	i'm gonna go do something and then i'll come back
POD1000000012_S0000255	it smells yummy
POD1000000012_S0000257	ah it smells really good
POD1000000012_S0000258	the experiment has been repeated many many times since it was first done by walter mischel in the late nineteen sixties
POD1000000012_S0000259	and there has been some controversy over what it exactly proved especially with some of the long-term outcomes and when you take factors like social class into consideration
POD1000000012_S0000260	yes absolutely but at the same time that basic experimental design with kids and treats and a timer
POD1000000012_S0000261	it's a really good context to see the strategies that children can and do use when their self-control is being tested
POD1000000012_S0000262	what seems to lead kids to be tempted by the smaller immediate reward the one marshmallow um is the fact that they're thinking about it in a hot way
POD1000000012_S0000263	and by hot ken fujita means intense or urgent something that you wanna act on right now but he says
POD1000000012_S0000264	if kids could find different ways to cool their thoughts um they were much more likely to wait out the delay
POD1000000012_S0000265	um and that knowing the strategies seemed to predict which kids were able to delay and which ones were not
POD1000000012_S0000266	for example kids pretended the marshmallows were just puffy clouds or that they were looking at the marshmallows through a picture frame
POD1000000012_S0000267	what i really like about this cory is that kids are using a strength their imaginations to overcome their weakness in self-control or delaying gratification
POD1000000012_S0000268	and rosemarie told us that practicing the strategies and learning them learning about them can be really empowering and actually therapeutic especially for kids who struggle with self-regulation
POD1000000012_S0000269	yeah and all the experts told us it's really important that practice not only happen in moments of crisis but you really lay the groundwork for it so that when those hot feelings arise they turn to the strategy and use it
POD1000000012_S0000270	so you plant it and then it pays off
POD1000000012_S0000271	and then it pays off later exactly
POD1000000012_S0000273	now takeaway number four speaking of imagination this is my favorite takeaway
POD1000000012_S0000275	i'm so excited about this one what would batman do
POD1000000012_S0000276	yeah ken fujita told us about a fascinating study
POD1000000012_S0000277	it's a variation on the marshmallow test where researchers asked kids to do a very boring task while they were simultaneously tempted to play a fun video game at the same time
POD1000000012_S0000278	but then
POD1000000012_S0000279	they asked kids to to identify their favorite superhero
POD1000000012_S0000280	and this is so neat we talked about this in a previous episode right
POD1000000012_S0000281	the characters like superheroes or princesses they're so powerful for kids whose self-images are really just starting to form
POD1000000012_S0000282	so if kids said batman for example they would get a batman mask and a batman cape
POD1000000012_S0000283	i'm batman-ing
POD1000000012_S0000285	and the kids were told while they were waiting out the delay they should ask themselves the question what would batman do
POD1000000012_S0000286	and what they found was really startling
POD1000000012_S0000287	so the kids who were channeling their heroes were much more able to resist the temptation
POD1000000012_S0000288	i love this and i i'm totally gonna use this although ah you know it's a problem cause like for me um it wouldn't be the normal bat it would be
POD1000000012_S0000290	cory look over there it's a bright
POD1000000012_S0000292	what
POD1000000012_S0000294	oh i see what you did there um ah nice nice kamenetz
POD1000000012_S0000296	takeaway number five be smart about distractions
POD1000000012_S0000297	getting out of a hot moment sometimes can take distraction just like when you asked cookie monster about his taste in russian literature
POD1000000012_S0000298	right or like when you're in the car with your kids and suddenly they transition from are we there yet to mom he's hitting me dad he's hitting me
POD1000000012_S0000299	ah that is the perfect time to resort to distraction like travel bingo or the license plate game
POD1000000012_S0000300	i'm going to take my attention off of this treat and place my attention on something else so i'm gonna go play with something else
POD1000000012_S0000301	right and every parent knows like rosemary says you need to have a long list of potential distractions up your sleeve right
POD1000000012_S0000302	it could be reading it could be singing
POD1000000012_S0000303	it could be dabbing
POD1000000012_S0000304	it could be drawing
POD1000000012_S0000305	or flossing
POD1000000012_S0000306	you mean like dental care
POD1000000012_S0000307	no no i mean like
POD1000000012_S0000309	you mean like fortnite care yeah got you
POD1000000012_S0000310	or i don't know youtubing a million different videos of lego batman rapping when you're supposed to be writing a podcast script
POD1000000012_S0000311	that's a good distraction
POD1000000012_S0000312	we have no idea about that and speaking of distractions
POD1000000012_S0000314	flip side here
POD1000000012_S0000316	removing distractions can also be an opportunity for you to set your kids up for success when it comes to self
POD1000000012_S0000318	frankly your co-host
POD1000000012_S0000320	or your co-host
POD1000000012_S0000321	so the idea here is remove opportunities for frustration right so maybe when they're working on their homework you keep the video games out of sight
POD1000000012_S0000322	or maybe you don't keep the cookie jar on the counter instead you go out for ice cream once a week
POD1000000012_S0000323	yeah and and you want your kids to build self-control
POD1000000012_S0000324	but you need to do it in a really age appropriate way you don't wanna exhaust them by testing their self-control constantly
POD1000000012_S0000325	and you also don't wanna set unrealistic goals that you know they're never gonna get to
POD1000000012_S0000326	and there're so many different ways to approach this our takeaway number six is the world is already full of opportunities to build self-regulation skills
POD1000000012_S0000327	so we've been talking about explicit strategies mostly for self-control but researchers are also backing up something that parents and educators have known for a long time
POD1000000012_S0000328	yeah there are so many everyday experiences that can build this broader set of executive function and self-regulation skills
POD1000000012_S0000329	ken fujita says for him one area was music
POD1000000012_S0000330	i attended music schools um i played violin and piano
POD1000000012_S0000332	did he love to practice no
POD1000000012_S0000333	nobody wants to practice um practicing is very tedious
POD1000000012_S0000334	um nobody likes to receive negative feedback right
POD1000000012_S0000335	um but you know but responding constructively to negative feedback um to you know enduring the the drudgery of of of everyday practicing these all require self-control
POD1000000012_S0000336	another activity that experiments have shown to improve self-regulation is martial arts
POD1000000012_S0000337	i'm also a martial arts instructor i practice the japanese martial art kendo the sword fighting
POD1000000012_S0000338	um and i have been amazed at watching children transform in front of my eyes some of them come in very undisciplined
POD1000000012_S0000339	but you know a couple of years of really hard intense training and practice and commitment they learn the value of delaying gratification
POD1000000012_S0000340	anya i just have to say for the record forget what would batman do from now on i'm asking myself what would ken fujita do
POD1000000012_S0000341	totally
POD1000000012_S0000342	and um let's also add to the list of martial arts um learning a foreign language ah huh practicing yoga
POD1000000012_S0000343	yeah
POD1000000012_S0000344	definitely proving strategies for building self-regulation skills
POD1000000012_S0000346	okay you guys cookie has been waiting all the time
POD1000000012_S0000348	yeah remember at the top of the episode cory left allegedly to get milk
POD1000000012_S0000349	we've been sitting in a different studio recording this whole podcast
POD1000000012_S0000350	ah i left him hanging he's practicing his strategies
POD1000000012_S0000351	i hope he's
POD1000000012_S0000354	his strategy
POD1000000012_S0000355	i hope so too so i guess it's time for me to go in there and say hi
POD1000000012_S0000356	oh and i still need to get the milk
POD1000000012_S0000357	all right i'll see you there in a minute
POD1000000012_S0000358	all right
POD1000000012_S0000360	oh hi hi anya
POD1000000012_S0000361	hi

POD1000000012_S0000389	let's recap
POD1000000012_S0000390	let's do it takeaway number one
POD1000000012_S0000391	it's for us parents start looking at self-regulation as a skill to be practiced
POD1000000012_S0000392	yeah learning social and emotional skills is like learning to play baseball or to ski
POD1000000012_S0000393	only much more important
POD1000000012_S0000394	we need to be supportive as parents and we need to validate our kids big feelings
POD1000000012_S0000395	also break up the skills into pieces give them strategies to get better and praise their efforts along the way
POD1000000012_S0000396	takeaway number two yelling calm down doesn't work
POD1000000012_S0000397	no we tried that it does not work
POD1000000012_S0000398	yeah
POD1000000012_S0000399	so instead
POD1000000012_S0000400	try belly breathing
POD1000000012_S0000401	a glitter jar
POD1000000012_S0000402	you can hug yourself hug a pillow hug a stuffed animal
POD1000000012_S0000404	and don't just do it once or twice make it a habit
POD1000000012_S0000405	takeaway number three pretend the cookie is plastic
POD1000000012_S0000406	kids have really vivid imaginations and they can use them to reframe a temptation
POD1000000012_S0000407	takeaway number four
POD1000000012_S0000409	a reminder that for kids channeling their heroes can make it easier to live up to their values including by being more patient
POD1000000012_S0000410	i love that it's so creative
POD1000000012_S0000412	takeaway number five be smart about distractions
POD1000000012_S0000413	when waiting is hard or kids need to cool down read a book sing a song
POD1000000012_S0000414	there is a long list of things they can do that will help
POD1000000012_S0000415	on the other hand if they're trying to finish their homework put that video game system out of view set them up for success
POD1000000012_S0000416	yeah distractions work both ways
POD1000000012_S0000417	takeaway number six the world is full of opportunities to self-regulate
POD1000000012_S0000418	yeah martial arts music yoga even learning a foreign language
POD1000000012_S0000419	they can all improve our self-control and our self-regulation both for kids and for grown-ups

POD1000000013_S0000003	and the northern ireland um local government commissioner for standards many things and soon to leave to become the police ombudsman for northern ireland
POD1000000013_S0000004	marie you're extremely welcome
POD1000000013_S0000005	you're greatly admired and respected throughout the ombudsman world and um we're lucky to have you
POD1000000013_S0000006	we like to start each episode of radio ombudsman by hearing a bit about our guests in terms of their background
POD1000000013_S0000007	where were you born for example and brought up
POD1000000013_S0000008	what kinds of values do you remember being imbibed with early on
POD1000000013_S0000009	well thank you rob and thank you for the kind introduction
POD1000000013_S0000010	and it's great to be on the this innovative programme radio ombudsman
POD1000000013_S0000011	where was i born i was born in belfast in northern ireland
POD1000000013_S0000012	i was born into a a large family i was the youngest of family of six
POD1000000013_S0000013	west belfast um in the nineteen sixties when i was born was a place of of much turmoil
POD1000000013_S0000014	and and my early
POD1000000013_S0000016	early childhood adult life and into my time at university was very much a a time of conflict in northern ireland
POD1000000013_S0000017	i came from very religious background where values were very important
POD1000000013_S0000018	so there was a a a willingness and a a desire on the part of my mum and dad to bring us up regardless to respect everybody and to respect everyone's views and religion
POD1000000013_S0000020	that's interesting and that really anticipates the follow-up question which is what do you learn and take from those awful situations
POD1000000013_S0000021	the need for fairness is very is very important part of communities getting getting on together
POD1000000013_S0000022	if one community feels they've been dealt with unfairly or one indeed one individual or a group of individuals that is you know potentially destabilizing for society and for that community
POD1000000013_S0000023	so i realised very early on something that i think is probably part of my nature which is this desire for fairness
POD1000000013_S0000025	does that explain why you took a law degree
POD1000000013_S0000026	in part one of the things that i've i've spoken about openly is the fact that i was in a ah you know a convent school
POD1000000013_S0000027	and i was there's a particular day i was called out of the assembly
POD1000000013_S0000028	i was twelve thirteen and i was hugely humiliated and embarrassed by the fact that i was being accused of stealing another girl's gym shoes when i hadn't
POD1000000013_S0000029	it was a mistake and that mistake came out but i remember that that feeling
POD1000000013_S0000030	i think that was the more cathartic moment if you like feeling of ah it's not i was on my own
POD1000000013_S0000031	and i was dealt with unfairly and i wanted to be a lawyer because i was gonna help people that were treated unfairly
POD1000000013_S0000032	so that that's what made me want to be a lawyer really
POD1000000013_S0000033	yeah okay
POD1000000013_S0000034	and after university i know you became a solicitor but was that straight away or
POD1000000013_S0000035	yes yes i didn't i now nowadays like interview there gap years
POD1000000013_S0000036	but yes i i went to the institute of legal studies ah practiced as a solicitor in private practice and then in the public sector
POD1000000013_S0000037	and mostly litigation and but started to focus on human rights and data protection freedom of information when i was in the public sector
POD1000000013_S0000038	so when did you join the information commissioner's office
POD1000000013_S0000039	two thousand and three
POD1000000013_S0000040	okay and what what did what did you do before then
POD1000000013_S0000041	before then i was i i worked for the ah the housing authority
POD1000000013_S0000042	i worked for seventeen years in the legal department of the housing authority dealing with intractable problems such as anti-social behaviour homelessness fractured communities we had to be housed near to each other
POD1000000013_S0000043	yeah
POD1000000013_S0000044	and so issues such as peace walls
POD1000000013_S0000045	so it was a good it was a good it grounding if you like for dealing with the issues that i deal with my but also in terms of the information
POD1000000013_S0000046	you know i recognise the need for for freedom of information and for people's information to be protected
POD1000000013_S0000047	and i really i loved my time in the information commissioner's office i was there five years
POD1000000013_S0000048	and you spent some of it in in manchester
POD1000000013_S0000050	was a treat
POD1000000013_S0000051	yes
POD1000000013_S0000052	privilege
POD1000000013_S0000053	yes
POD1000000013_S0000054	and it was a a a time of emerging from you know the office was changing from being the data protection commissioner a kind of a registration function
POD1000000013_S0000055	and had taken on freedom of information which was so exciting
POD1000000013_S0000056	and it was about the office getting geared up for freedom of information and indeed having regional offices
POD1000000013_S0000057	and the one in northern ireland i actually helped establish that office
POD1000000013_S0000058	and when did you become an ombudsman
POD1000000013_S0000059	oh in two thousand and nine so after leaving the i c o i went back to private practice
POD1000000013_S0000060	i worked in a commercial law firm and then realised that really wasn't for me that i was much more i my my main interest was social justice
POD1000000013_S0000061	so i so the role of deputy ombudsman and i thought that's interesting i'll think i'll i'll put my hat in the ring for that
POD1000000013_S0000062	and yeah i i was lucky i got the job
POD1000000013_S0000063	and you were lucky enough to work for the legendary tom frawley
POD1000000013_S0000064	dr frawley yeah he's he's been a huge support to me throughout my career and you know and and mentor
POD1000000013_S0000065	and yes legendary
POD1000000013_S0000066	we were talking earlier today about leadership and his famous phrase on leadership is i am their leader which way did they go
POD1000000013_S0000068	so it's kind of you know for to be a leader you need to to have followers
POD1000000013_S0000069	absolutely
POD1000000013_S0000070	okay so ah for for our english listeners and for those in the united states northern ireland is obviously unique politically and socially
POD1000000013_S0000071	but i don't think that many of us have a great deal of understanding of how this must have impacted on your work as an ombudsman
POD1000000013_S0000072	could you say a little bit about that
POD1000000013_S0000073	well i think because the first ombudsman's office in northern ireland was created in nineteen sixty-nine so we are we are celebrating our fiftieth anniversary year this year
POD1000000013_S0000074	it was it was created to deal with complaints of discrimination in housing employment and particularly in local government
POD1000000013_S0000075	i think that the genesis the idea for an ombudsman was to bring fairness to the citizen
POD1000000013_S0000076	and i think that's that's really been always a a a a key element of the work of the office
POD1000000013_S0000077	i mean we feel it very very strongly that we are in the justice business that it is about but you know being fair
POD1000000013_S0000078	and not only being fair to complainants or people who feel the public services services have failed them but being fair to to to those that are wrongly criticised or wrongly blamed
POD1000000013_S0000079	because i think an ombudsman the role of an ombudsman is also to provide vindication when things gone right
POD1000000013_S0000080	what about the impact of sectarianism on your work both inside the office and externally as as ombudsman
POD1000000013_S0000081	well we you know i have ah a workforce who believe totally my staff totally believe in fairness and equality
POD1000000013_S0000082	and it doesn't matter who complains to the office that it doesn't matter who complains or what the nature of the complaint is that we're gonna deal with it
POD1000000013_S0000083	but i suppose where the area where which is most challenging is in my role as local government standards commissioner where i myself have been accused of sectarianism
POD1000000013_S0000084	because you know i was adjudicating on a a a particular councillor from a particular ah part of the unionist community
POD1000000013_S0000085	so there is that added layer of not only wanting to do things right to make the right decision but being aware that no matter what that decision is it might please one side or the other
POD1000000013_S0000086	so to be accused of sectarianism was a huge hurt for me because that's not that's not part of my values or my staff values
POD1000000013_S0000087	i mean that's a big issue because it affects you personally
POD1000000013_S0000088	how do you deal with that because you're a very resilient tough person but even that must be hard to deal with
POD1000000013_S0000089	well first of all i've got huge support from my deputy and the senior management team who reassured me that of course this isn't true and you know it isn't true and we know it isn't true
POD1000000013_S0000090	but i think what was difficult was the impact on my family and how they felt
POD1000000013_S0000091	my husband was angry and and my children were unhappy about it
POD1000000013_S0000092	and how did it affect me i learnt to deal with i learnt that you can deal with this sort of criticism
POD1000000013_S0000093	and i learnt that ah behind it all you've got to be sure that you're doing you're making the right decision
POD1000000013_S0000094	i can remember a few weeks ago when i was savagely criticised on twitter
POD1000000013_S0000095	and i was thirsting to reply and my oldest son said to me leave it alone dad they want you to reply
POD1000000013_S0000096	and i think that was quite wise advice
POD1000000013_S0000097	so you do need to consult with people on personal issues don't you
POD1000000013_S0000098	i think you do need to consult
POD1000000013_S0000099	and you do of what what's been helpful as been part of the ombudsman community's ah response to this is and you the personal support you've given me rob i was able to talk to you about it
POD1000000013_S0000100	i was able to talk to others like the current police ombudsman for northern ireland who've said leave it alone
POD1000000013_S0000101	just leave it because if you do anything if you take any legal action then it's merely going to provide more oxygen
POD1000000013_S0000102	yeah
POD1000000013_S0000103	doesn't stop it being difficult
POD1000000013_S0000104	no
POD1000000013_S0000105	personally difficult and that's where the resilience comes in
POD1000000013_S0000106	that's where you've got to get up the next morning go into work and your staff have got to see that although it might affect you inside
POD1000000013_S0000107	that you're gonna continue to lead the office and do the job
POD1000000013_S0000108	thank you that's important
POD1000000013_S0000109	let's just move that's on a little bit and talk about human rights issues in relation to the actions of public services
POD1000000013_S0000110	you launched a brilliant human rights manual which sets out an approach that many ombudsmen in europe take
POD1000000013_S0000111	but it's not particularly prevalent in the united kingdom about actions that can be taken by an ombudsman
POD1000000013_S0000112	could you tell us a bit more about how you created this
POD1000000013_S0000113	well it was created jointly with the northern ireland human rights commission and it started as ever as as all good ideas with a conversation
POD1000000013_S0000114	and it was a conversation between the human rights commission and our office around the sort of case work that we were dealing with
POD1000000013_S0000115	we were dealing with issues like the roma community and feeling discriminated because they didn't have access to health services
POD1000000013_S0000116	we were dealing with issues of consent patients not giving consent to interventions and the family and the patient feeling excluded from the decision-making
POD1000000013_S0000117	but also we realised that ombudsmen and human rights commissions and and or equality bodies are actually doing the same job
POD1000000013_S0000118	so we mean ah my my style is to move on from the conversation and actually have a product
POD1000000013_S0000119	and the product was how to do this manual for ombudsman staff
POD1000000013_S0000120	how to introduce human rights principles into ombudsman investigations
POD1000000013_S0000121	and it's quite simple and it's not about strasbourg jurisprudence
POD1000000013_S0000122	that's the beauty of it i think for non-lawyers ah you know for for non-legal staff that they're they're very simple principles
POD1000000013_S0000123	participation a person affected by a decision by whatever public service provider be it health be it housing be it ah you know local government that they have to be able to participate
POD1000000013_S0000124	they have to be given enough information to participate effectively in the decision-making
POD1000000013_S0000125	so there's the principle of empowerment and the giving information
POD1000000013_S0000126	there's the principle of non-discrimination and being treated treated equally and fairly and having equal access
POD1000000013_S0000127	and ultimately like the fourth principle of the human rights-based approach is accountability and that's what we ombudsmen do
POD1000000013_S0000128	we hold public services to ah kind
POD1000000013_S0000129	and would you say that you've been able to hold public services more to account as a result of having that human rights-based approach
POD1000000013_S0000130	yes i think maladministration is a tool
POD1000000013_S0000131	but i think that having a human rights lens allows you to look more closely ah away so much from the process as to how the process actually affects the individuals and affects the individuals rights
POD1000000013_S0000132	so if give you an example we had a case where a young man died as a result of a a routine ear operation
POD1000000013_S0000133	and and it was a one-in-a-million reaction to a titanium implant to the packing around a titanium implant
POD1000000013_S0000134	the point being his his mum and dad believed that he wasn't consented for that intervention
POD1000000013_S0000135	the and and the thought was unfair and affected his human rights
POD1000000013_S0000136	the coroner had refused to undertake an inquest saying it didn't affect his human rights
POD1000000013_S0000137	when it came to my office we identified the human rights principle of participation
POD1000000013_S0000138	if i know what is gonna happen to me if i'm told of the risks ah instead of someone else making decision for me then my human rights have been respected
POD1000000013_S0000139	when i drew that out in the investigation report i i was able to come to a conclusion that ah where there was a it was a conflict between the experts
POD1000000013_S0000140	some said well another consultant might not have done the implant another said they would have they would have and they would have gone ahead with the implant
POD1000000013_S0000141	but actually the human rights-based approach meant that i thought about the individual and that they hadn't been properly consented
POD1000000013_S0000142	the result not only did the family get an investigation report identifying this issue but they were able to go to the coroner
POD1000000013_S0000143	he he's commenced an inquest
POD1000000013_S0000144	now you you have two things in northern ireland that we don't have you have a
POD1000000013_S0000145	partly because of your own excellence and bringing it about you have an integrated public service ombudsman scheme and you have the power of own initiative
POD1000000013_S0000146	are these valuable additions to the way ombudsmen should be working
POD1000000013_S0000147	i i do believe in the one-stop-shop model
POD1000000013_S0000148	the public services ombudsman in northern ireland and looks at complaints about government departments statutory agencies local government health and social care education schools universities colleges
POD1000000013_S0000149	i think that can be challenging for staff but i believe that they enjoy the variety
POD1000000013_S0000150	but i also believe that an ombudsman ombudsman principles of good administration apply across sectors
POD1000000013_S0000151	so yes i think it is the value
POD1000000013_S0000152	i think having one place to go to to seek redress for injustice is is important
POD1000000013_S0000153	if people don't want to go to court there's an ombudsman there that can look at the full range
POD1000000013_S0000154	own initiative is for me an essential tool of every ombudsman's toolkit
POD1000000013_S0000155	when you look internationally
POD1000000013_S0000156	you look at ombudsmen in australia you look at ombudsmen in europe you look at ombudsmen north america the ontario ombudsmen the rest western australian ombudsmen
POD1000000013_S0000157	they all have own initiative they've all had own initiative from the start
POD1000000013_S0000158	the irish ombudsmen act that was created in nineteen eighty had own initiative there as well as dealing with individual complaints
POD1000000013_S0000159	for me an ombudsman without own initiative can't fulfill the the the mandate of ah ah ah improving public services for many not just for the individual
POD1000000013_S0000160	um so you would you you'd have no hesitation about introducing and initiative it's essential
POD1000000013_S0000161	not not at all i was lucky to be part of the development of the public services ombudsman act
POD1000000013_S0000162	and was keen to had had an opportunity to persuade officials who were perhaps nervous about the an ombudsman having own initiative powers
POD1000000013_S0000163	that really this was something that actually could benefit public services in the end
POD1000000013_S0000164	see it is about prevention
POD1000000013_S0000165	you can deal with numerous complaints but never get to the core issue whereas own initiative allows you to tackle the core issue of systemic failing
POD1000000013_S0000166	well i i agree with that
POD1000000013_S0000167	and that's why i think it's necessary for us to have the reform that you've already been operating for nearly three years now
POD1000000013_S0000168	yes and now ah the welsh ombudsman is about to get that also
POD1000000013_S0000169	i believe scottish ombudsman would like own initiative
POD1000000013_S0000170	so if that happens it means devolved administrations have it
POD1000000013_S0000171	and the first ever ombudsman in these islands the parliamentary ombudsman has not
POD1000000013_S0000172	and i think that's missing an opportunity to to improve public services for the citizen
POD1000000013_S0000173	as you move on from the public service ombudsman what what are you most proud of
POD1000000013_S0000174	is it bringing the whole thing together the integration of the various systems
POD1000000013_S0000175	well i think the legislation that allowed the public services ombudsman as a one-stop-shop for complaints about public services
POD1000000013_S0000176	but also being able to bring in local government standards
POD1000000013_S0000177	because northern ireland was one of the was the only part in europe didn't have a mandatory code of conduct for local representatives
POD1000000013_S0000178	that was introduced in two thousand and fourteen
POD1000000013_S0000179	and my office and my so and and i as deputy ombudsman now ombudsman have been key to establishing an investigative and judicative function in northern ireland
POD1000000013_S0000180	that that is a unique model but i believe operates very well
POD1000000013_S0000181	that is not work that is out with ombudsmanary
POD1000000013_S0000182	because for me ethical standards values fairness they're all part of good governance and the that's where we ombudsmen are
POD1000000013_S0000183	we're not a court we don't declare don't make binding decisions
POD1000000013_S0000184	but nevertheless we can influence with the recommendations that we make and with setting standards
POD1000000013_S0000186	now we asked colleagues on twitter to send in questions
POD1000000013_S0000187	and we had a set of questions from one dissatisfied user of the service under your predecessor who felt that she hadn't been treated fairly by the system
POD1000000013_S0000188	what can you say to people in that position
POD1000000013_S0000189	i think that ah many people misunderstand the role of the ombudsman
POD1000000013_S0000190	they believe that the ombudsman is there particularly to advocate for them and their particular issue
POD1000000013_S0000191	ombudsmen are impartial so if there the a finding of no failure can be disappointing to complainants
POD1000000013_S0000192	and i believe that was the case in relation to the particular and individual that you're referring to
POD1000000013_S0000193	so the previous ombudsman did not find in her favour and that can be disappointing
POD1000000013_S0000194	but then you got to understand that there're the other side of that is that perhaps a clinician or a a member of health staff who has been criticised receives ah ah you know a message that actually they did it right
POD1000000013_S0000195	but there are many occasions in which complainants don't agree with my decisions
POD1000000013_S0000197	but i still have to decide fairly ensure there's a fair process ensure everyone gets an opportunity to comment and and and report on the matter
POD1000000013_S0000198	ah that's that's what an ombudsman does
POD1000000013_S0000199	yeah it's difficult sometimes to explain that while the complaint belongs to the complainant the decision belongs to the ombudsman providing it's evidence-based and and rigorous
POD1000000013_S0000200	provided it's evidence evidence-based and rigorous but also i believe fair
POD1000000013_S0000201	we have to give everyone and opportunity including those who are criticised
POD1000000013_S0000202	but this issue about it's an ombudsman decision while you bring your complaint
POD1000000013_S0000203	it is the ombudsman's decision has actually been written into the legislation that i referred to
POD1000000013_S0000204	which is that under the northern irish ombudsman legislation the two thousand and sixteen nine act that i mentioned that even if a complainant withdrew their complaint i can still investigate
POD1000000013_S0000205	so it is the ombudsman's investigation
POD1000000013_S0000206	now you you've been with the office in northern ireland for ten years
POD1000000013_S0000207	so long time will you have any regrets about
POD1000000013_S0000208	moving on even though it's to an even more difficult and challenging role
POD1000000013_S0000209	i'd have huge i have huge regrets about leaving my staff because they are um they are wonderful to work with hugely supportive
POD1000000013_S0000210	and on days when i don't have my usual level of energy they give me the energy back to keep going
POD1000000013_S0000211	so i've regrets about leaving my staff
POD1000000013_S0000212	but i mean i was asked this question about why do you want to undertake the roll of police ombudsman
POD1000000013_S0000213	i do believe that i it's about public service and it's about bringing my experience
POD1000000013_S0000214	you said ten years experience in the ombudsman's office five years experience in the information commissioner's office
POD1000000013_S0000215	it's ah bringing bringing that to bear in what is you know a very challenging area dealing with police complaints in northern ireland
POD1000000013_S0000216	now you've spent the day with us speaking to my colleagues at our all-staff away day
POD1000000013_S0000217	what advice would you give to ah younger colleagues many of whom of only recently joined the ombuds profession
POD1000000013_S0000218	the advice i would give is first of all it is a profession
POD1000000013_S0000219	as you know rob ah from your discussions with me i believe very much that that that it has to be recognised as a profession
POD1000000013_S0000220	and that um i'm amazed at your accreditation project at getting that off the ground
POD1000000013_S0000221	i would advise the young people in this office to take advantage of that
POD1000000013_S0000222	that is a wonderful opportunity and i realise the rigour and the commitment to achieving that accreditation but i would say go for it
POD1000000013_S0000223	i mean that that in this you are leading the way in ombudsman in the ombudsman world
POD1000000013_S0000224	it is um something that many have talked about i've talked about it myself
POD1000000013_S0000225	i've tried to do it but you and amanda have actually done it and i think that is amazing
POD1000000013_S0000226	so my advice is take the opportunity
POD1000000013_S0000227	marie anderson thank you very much indeed
POD1000000013_S0000228	it's been an absolute privilege and a pleasure talking to you
POD1000000013_S0000230	thank you rob thank you
POD1000000013_S0000232	thank you for listening to radio on ombudsman we would love to know what you think so please leave a review or comment
POD1000000013_S0000233	if you like what you hear please share and subscribe to future episodes
POD1000000015_S0000001	hello this is rob behrens here welcoming you to another episode of radio ombudsman
POD1000000015_S0000002	i'm delighted to say that my guest today is rosemary agnew scottish public services ombudsman
POD1000000015_S0000003	rosemary took up the post of ombudsman around the same time as i did in two thousand and seventeen and before this she was the scottish information commissioner
POD1000000015_S0000004	she has a wealth of experience in public service which we'll come on to
POD1000000015_S0000005	she has developed the idea of a complaint's standards authority in scotland which is something that i want to ask her about
POD1000000015_S0000006	rosemary you're very welcome thank you for coming
POD1000000015_S0000007	now we like to start each episode by hearing a bit about our guests and where they come from
POD1000000015_S0000008	so can you tell us a bit about your early life and the values you you got from that
POD1000000015_S0000009	i am hugely lucky i come from a very loving family
POD1000000015_S0000010	i have four younger brothers so i think it fair to say that um issues about equality were probably in there before i even knew the word
POD1000000015_S0000011	but my my family a military family so ah travelled around as a child
POD1000000015_S0000012	and mostly i'd say what i got from them was a real strong moral compass
POD1000000015_S0000013	not drilled into me must do this mustn't do that but about treating people with respect particularly when we were traveling to new places and meeting new people for the first time
POD1000000015_S0000014	and and i think that that moral and ethical background um not called that then
POD1000000015_S0000015	it was just try and be a good person tell the truth do your homework on time all these sort of things probably instilled in me a strong work ethic
POD1000000015_S0000016	but it also instilled in me a very deep level of caring for people
POD1000000015_S0000017	ah ah
POD1000000015_S0000018	because i was able to see over the whole of my life still am a whole range of people who have different starts in life different opportunities
POD1000000015_S0000019	and and i think within that i've developed my own sense of justice
POD1000000015_S0000020	and i'm hugely grateful to my parents they're lovely people
POD1000000015_S0000021	and and i even go with my brothers occasionally
POD1000000015_S0000023	when you were traveling around as part of the military family did you was that difficult did you feel like an outsider
POD1000000015_S0000024	yes and no to outsider
POD1000000015_S0000025	i went to a lot of schools so you had to learn to make friends quickly and you couldn't have a a long lead-in time if you like
POD1000000015_S0000026	because i lived a lot of time in in military accommodation that was like a big family of itself because you tended to be with people who were in a similar situation
POD1000000015_S0000027	but mostly i suppose i just tour as a big sense of adventure
POD1000000015_S0000028	it doesn't suit all but for me it was great because ah i just moved around and had a whole wealth of experience which i don't think i would've got in any other way
POD1000000015_S0000029	what did you study at university
POD1000000015_S0000030	well my main claim to fame i think sitting here in manchester is the thing that i'm probably most pleased with is my um m b a from manchester business school
POD1000000015_S0000031	um i also have a teaching qualification
POD1000000015_S0000032	but i think the m b a because i went back to that after i'd been working a while was probably the most enlightening part of my education
POD1000000015_S0000033	because again i learnt a lot about a lot of things but what it it gave me because i had the was able to reflect on a working background as well
POD1000000015_S0000034	what it gave me was a sense of how to ask questions and challenge in a way perhaps i hadn't done before that
POD1000000015_S0000035	they're very famous alumni from that m b a i think vincent kompany is a graduate of that scheme did you know him
POD1000000015_S0000036	no i didn't in fact i i i don't think that any of my cohort ah are names that have ah come up to prominence
POD1000000015_S0000037	but have all gone on to do good things some very interesting things
POD1000000015_S0000038	and i i for myself because i was i was public sector at the time and i've remained public sector for most of the time since then perhaps have a slightly different view of it
POD1000000015_S0000039	because i was very deliberate in not always going down public sector routes for study or public sector modules because i wanted to learn more about different sorts of thinking
POD1000000015_S0000040	when did you decide what sort of career you wanted
POD1000000015_S0000041	i'm yet to meet an ombudsman who decided they wanted to be an ombudsman
POD1000000015_S0000042	yeah
POD1000000015_S0000043	i i think
POD1000000015_S0000044	i can own up to that
POD1000000015_S0000045	it it fair to say that
POD1000000015_S0000046	i wen to work i was working in china um lecturing in business and economics and i needed a job when i got back
POD1000000015_S0000047	so i thought oh they're advertising for investigators at the local government ombudsman that will do for a while it'll pay the mortgage until i get something else
POD1000000015_S0000048	and i've pretty much never left ombudsmanning or information commissioning since
POD1000000015_S0000049	and i think what it was was like found a job that i enjoyed it was challenging but actually fitted in with my value system
POD1000000015_S0000050	right and you've had a very distinguished and varied career you were the scottish information commissioner
POD1000000015_S0000051	and what what was the highlight of that before you came to the scottish public service ombudsman
POD1000000015_S0000052	i think it's hard to say what highlight is in terms of being the information commissioner
POD1000000015_S0000053	there are a number of things that i did that i was really proud of in a good way
POD1000000015_S0000054	one of them was it it sounds very trivial but we established a portal for the uploading of freedom of information statistics from public bodies in scotland
POD1000000015_S0000055	and what that means is now there is a three or four year database of the number of freedom of information requests and the outcome of them for the whole of scotland
POD1000000015_S0000056	that we can look at trends we can look at developments
POD1000000015_S0000057	and that actually for me was a highlight because i didn't necessarily have the enforcement power to do it
POD1000000015_S0000058	it was done through cooperation and co-working with public bodies
POD1000000015_S0000059	ah the other couple of things that really stick in my mind was very very early on a particular decision i made
POD1000000015_S0000060	which was enforcing and telling the scottish government they had to disclose whether they had taken legal advice about scotland's position with europe
POD1000000015_S0000061	should they gain independence because it was the time of the independence referendum
POD1000000015_S0000062	yeah
POD1000000015_S0000063	and and why that's particularly interesting is it was a very big issue i think in the independence referendum and nobody i think would have foreseen where we are now
POD1000000015_S0000064	the finals one which i think i'll talk about more when we talk maybe about some of the um ombudsman powers
POD1000000015_S0000065	was about a different way of intervening in relation to good and poor practice with scottish public bodies
POD1000000015_S0000066	you're you're english i think is that correct
POD1000000015_S0000067	yes
POD1000000015_S0000068	so has there ever been an issue about you holding prestigious and important jobs in scotland
POD1000000015_S0000069	about an english person having that responsibility
POD1000000015_S0000070	no um i have a scottish name agnew is a scottish name and i'm married to somebody from a scottish descent
POD1000000015_S0000071	i was once asked by a journalist was i happy that i had adopted scotland as my home
POD1000000015_S0000072	and i think it's fair to say the answer reflected how i felt which was i'm eternally grateful that scotland has adopted me as ah somebody who lives there and does these things within scotland
POD1000000015_S0000073	but no it's it's a different experience to being in england but i've never not to my face anyway ever had an issue with being english
POD1000000015_S0000074	that's good to hear
POD1000000015_S0000075	and now can we just talk a bit about um the scottish ombudsman which you took up post nearly three years ago
POD1000000015_S0000076	the devolved ombudsman are different from the u k ombudsman
POD1000000015_S0000077	because they're more modern they've adopted legislation to make them more relevant to developing situations and you have more powers than the u k ombudsman has
POD1000000015_S0000078	what what's it like being ah the head of an integrated public service ombudsman is that a good thing
POD1000000015_S0000079	yes i think it's a very good thing because you have a different sort of insight you have a different sort of overview and sectors do vary
POD1000000015_S0000080	the there is variance because they're working to different regulations it it makes your job very varied also
POD1000000015_S0000081	um i think one of the the challenges with it though is if you work in a specific sectors
POD1000000015_S0000082	so if i reflect on local government ombudsman you became much more immersed in the technicalities of local government
POD1000000015_S0000083	when you work across sectors what we find is particularly a personal reflection is um i have to do a bit more digging around to find out about how the the sectors operate in scotland
POD1000000015_S0000084	and um i also rely quite a lot on professional advice particularly for health and social work
POD1000000015_S0000085	so we don't necessarily develop through experience of volume of cases the same experience that you do when you perhaps looking at
POD1000000015_S0000086	at one particular area of public service
POD1000000015_S0000087	but the other thing that i think reflects with um myself and the welsh and the northern ireland ombudsman is because the population of the country is smaller
POD1000000015_S0000088	and the country itself has a a different sort of structure to it
POD1000000015_S0000089	you often get given things to do that are not necessarily what you'd expect an ombudsman to be doing
POD1000000015_S0000090	so as well as complaint handling and the the complaint standards we also have duties for with the final stage of appeal for a benefit scottish welfare fund
POD1000000015_S0000091	and then when you look at northern ireland and wales they also have other things that are different
POD1000000015_S0000092	and and i think that is as much a challenge as anything because it's almost like running two completely different functions but trying to have an integrated organisation
POD1000000015_S0000093	okay so you rely on professional advice but there must also be a challenge for your case handlers to deal with the the width of functions that they come up with
POD1000000015_S0000094	are you divided according to the sectors or to to people have
POD1000000015_S0000096	multitasking to do
POD1000000015_S0000097	they have multitasking to do and they are incredible set of people my investigators
POD1000000015_S0000098	but i think one of the things that drives us and that is probably the the uniting thing is very much about values
POD1000000015_S0000099	and i think like most ombudsman organisations i've ever come across um it's a fairly unique workforce i would say
POD1000000015_S0000100	because you ask anybody why we're there and very rarely will you deviate far from because we want to make a difference because we want to see improvement because we want to make things better
POD1000000015_S0000101	so yes it's a challenge having the scope and we have some individuals who may have a background in a particular area but we don't have specialists
POD1000000015_S0000102	okay now what you have which we don't have is the status of being a complaints standards authority
POD1000000015_S0000103	could you explain to our listeners briefly what that means
POD1000000015_S0000104	briefly what it means is the ombudsman is responsible for setting a model complaints handling process that all scottish bodies must follow
POD1000000015_S0000105	and we then with that have a duty to monitor performance in relation to complaint handling and combined with some of our other powers duty to enforce good practice to report on it
POD1000000015_S0000106	now that sounds you know oh that's nice model complaints handling
POD1000000015_S0000107	but what it means in practice is with some slight variations by sector um because different sectors have slightly different needs
POD1000000015_S0000108	it means that anybody making a complaint to a public body in scotland and about a public body in scotland is basically making a complaint under the same set of standards
POD1000000015_S0000109	so the model complaints handling process says that the first stage of a complaint you must try and respond within five working days to resolve it
POD1000000015_S0000110	very big focus on resolution
POD1000000015_S0000111	if you can't or the person is not satisfied you can then take another twenty working days to look at it in more detail
POD1000000015_S0000112	if it's something that you think you need more than twenty days for then talk to the complainer about that
POD1000000015_S0000113	but it essentially means that if somebody does not receive a response or doesn't receive a response in time they get to the ombudsman a lot quicker than they might otherwise do
POD1000000015_S0000114	the other benefit of the complaints model complaints handling process is that there is a very strong focus on learning from complaints
POD1000000015_S0000115	so the standards that go with this which incidentally i have to lay before the scottish parliament the standards
POD1000000015_S0000116	they also have a very strong bent on learning from complaints
POD1000000015_S0000117	and i think that's an area where we can perhaps develop more in how we hold public bodies to account to demonstrate that learning
POD1000000015_S0000118	because like our complaints the model complaints handling we have to show that there is an impact and that there is value to individuals and to public services as a whole
POD1000000015_S0000119	ah i think for me the the most valuable thing about it though is it gives you an opportunity to work with public bodies not always in opposition to them
POD1000000015_S0000120	which with the best will in the world however much you try a resolution or a a a sort of discursive way of looking at complaints
POD1000000015_S0000121	once a complaint has reached the ombudsman it is in many ways adversarial whether you want it to be or not
POD1000000015_S0000122	but when you're talking about complaint handling as a whole you have an opportunity actually to help public bodies
POD1000000015_S0000123	and encourage them to get better at complaint handling which you hope means they get better at learning from complaints
POD1000000015_S0000124	which means people get the right service the first time
POD1000000015_S0000125	i don't think we'll ever eliminate complaints but certainly it it hopefully will make it a more productive experience
POD1000000015_S0000126	now i i'm a full supporter of what you're doing
POD1000000015_S0000127	i'm a burglar of your practice when i was the higher education ombudsman i stole it hook line and sinker to use in english universities
POD1000000015_S0000128	the idea that they could resolve complaints within five days was anathema to them they wouldn't they wouldn't have that we ended up with ninety
POD1000000015_S0000129	but ah nevertheless they they did it
POD1000000015_S0000130	but the difference and the the radical nature of what you do is effectively you are a regulator now
POD1000000015_S0000131	whereas ombudsman have traditionally always said we rely on our moral authority not on a coercive power
POD1000000015_S0000132	has that made a difference or is it just words
POD1000000015_S0000133	no i i don't think it makes is made a difference yet
POD1000000015_S0000134	i i also think i should add that i wasn't ombudsman when the complaints standards authority came in
POD1000000015_S0000135	yeah
POD1000000015_S0000136	and credit has to go to jim martin my predecessor for driving this yeah
POD1000000015_S0000137	yeah
POD1000000015_S0000138	what he's left me as a legacy is something really good to develop and work with which is what we're doing now
POD1000000015_S0000139	having been information commissioner which really is a regulatory function you your decision is binding or you go to court
POD1000000015_S0000140	i think the concept of regulation probably hasn't crept into our thinking with complaints standards in quite the same way
POD1000000015_S0000141	but it is something that we currently developing but maybe not calling it regulation in the same way
POD1000000015_S0000142	because one of the things that i would say learning from hindsight is that we took a very structured approach of rolling it out sector by sector this model complaints handling
POD1000000015_S0000143	and what that meant was it was a number of years before every public body in scotland was following this
POD1000000015_S0000144	so the n h s was the last and that's been the last just coming up to the end of their second year
POD1000000015_S0000145	now if you compare that to the first which was local government
POD1000000015_S0000146	local government now is a really high percentage of complaints get ah responded to in the first instance in the five working days
POD1000000015_S0000147	ah i think from memory it's it's over eighty percent and that's really significant for complainers
POD1000000015_S0000148	now what we've been looking at in the last few months and we went live with in april is what we've called our support and intervention policy
POD1000000015_S0000149	and this is a a concept that i brought with me from being information commissioner
POD1000000015_S0000150	and and basically was looking at all the powers that you have as an ombudsman because the real value comes in the combination of them not just the individual bits
POD1000000015_S0000151	so when you look at the powers to set complaint handling processes to take action if complaint handling falls short you then look at other things like your information gathering powers
POD1000000015_S0000152	we've created a framework which sets out what our powers are and within that what we are going to do to either support or if necessary intervene
POD1000000015_S0000153	because when we for example a simple example we might see a number of complaints from a public body where the final response that they give to the complainer does not signpost the ombudsman
POD1000000015_S0000154	they have a duty to do that under the complaints handling process
POD1000000015_S0000155	so we are getting better at our own intelligence we're logging feedback recommendations observations from ah what we see in complaints
POD1000000015_S0000156	so if we spot something like that we might just well my my investigators my complaints reviewers will let the the public body know
POD1000000015_S0000157	we give feedback in decisions
POD1000000015_S0000158	if we keep seeing that we might give it more formal and say we spotted this a number of times
POD1000000015_S0000159	but is there any help yeah we might offer to say share a template letter
POD1000000015_S0000160	or if it's something different perhaps go and give them some training if we've got the resource to do that
POD1000000015_S0000161	but we set it out step by step at which point it becomes a management issue and senior managers might actually contact senior managers or chief executives
POD1000000015_S0000162	the ultimate being we use the powers that the ombudsman has to enforce and report
POD1000000015_S0000164	very incremental and civilised but ah do you do you come across intransigence
POD1000000015_S0000165	well it went live in april and so far we've not found intransigence
POD1000000015_S0000166	and i think some of this is drawing on experience of
POD1000000015_S0000167	information commissioner of that i'll give you a very simple example
POD1000000015_S0000168	similar powers to compel production of information for an investigation
POD1000000015_S0000169	and telling public bodies very formally if you do not provide this this and this by this date i will report on this i will take further action
POD1000000015_S0000170	it can actually be contempt to treated as contempt of court in scotland
POD1000000015_S0000171	so you only need to make that clear that you're going to do it and to do it once and then report on it in your annual report
POD1000000015_S0000172	and actually public bodies realise i think that you're being serious
POD1000000015_S0000173	but we try to get to the point before that where you point out this is the value particularly for the complainer of doing this
POD1000000015_S0000174	so we're in early days we haven't come across the real intransigence yet
POD1000000015_S0000175	but i've no doubt that there'll be some there at some point
POD1000000015_S0000176	but the word civilised is a good one and we will endeavour to be as civilised as we can but firm with it
POD1000000015_S0000177	what what is your you report to the scottish parliament
POD1000000015_S0000178	yes
POD1000000015_S0000179	what is your relationship like with that body
POD1000000015_S0000180	i'd say it's pretty good in the sense of it's open challenging and when i say friendly i don't mean we're all friends it's it's it's very professional in many ways
POD1000000015_S0000181	so i my main dealings are with the scottish parliamentary corporate body
POD1000000015_S0000182	i get my funding through them so we have contact with them on a fairly regular basis
POD1000000015_S0000183	each year i appear before the local government to communities committee to be held accountable for my annual report
POD1000000015_S0000184	so they'll ask me questions about our performance about what we're doing
POD1000000015_S0000185	i do appear before other committees as well either in relation to other policies or in relation to other consultations that we've responded to
POD1000000015_S0000186	i would say in scotland that generally the ombudsman is held in high regard and seen as being independent and impartial
POD1000000015_S0000187	and probably the the the most telling evidence of this is we're taking on new powers next year
POD1000000015_S0000188	this is about whistleblowing
POD1000000015_S0000189	yes we i'm taking on the wonderful title of independent national whistleblowing officer for the n h s in scotland
POD1000000015_S0000190	wow
POD1000000015_S0000191	and the reason that we are taking on this function is because the government's public consultation it was suggested it should be the ombudsman
POD1000000015_S0000192	it's another good example of how in a smaller jurisdiction you get a number of different things
POD1000000015_S0000193	but going back to parliament they have held me to account on things but also where i have brought something to them in my my committee appearances they've also been quite supportive
POD1000000015_S0000194	so one of my beefs about my legislation is complaints must be in writing unless there are special circumstances
POD1000000015_S0000195	now the problem with that is the onus is on the complainer to show special circumstances
POD1000000015_S0000196	and it means you can't be as flexible in how you take complaints
POD1000000015_S0000197	yeah
POD1000000015_S0000198	and i've been trying since i became ombudsman to have the legislation it's secondary legislation to say i can take complaints in any format
POD1000000015_S0000199	and at the last parliamentary appearance the committee did actually write to the government and say we think this is a good idea please could you look into this again for us
POD1000000015_S0000200	sadly the scottish government are not taking it forward at this time because they have other business and don't have the resource apparently which is very disappointing
POD1000000015_S0000201	we're coming towards the end but let me ask you a few quick-fire questions
POD1000000015_S0000202	so you're funded differently to the way we're funded because we we get our money from a broad treasury vote
POD1000000015_S0000203	but you're funded through parliament
POD1000000015_S0000204	have you got enough money is that a satisfactory way to do things
POD1000000015_S0000205	no i haven't got enough money
POD1000000015_S0000206	and it's satisfactory in the sense of i think it is good that the funding doesn't come from government
POD1000000015_S0000207	it adds something to you being able to say i am independent what i think is unsatisfactory about it it's ah probably the same for you it's the annularity of it
POD1000000015_S0000208	it's very difficult to do proper business and resource planning when you can't guarantee you will have the money to do it next year
POD1000000015_S0000209	it also means that i feel like do go through some fairly unnecessary hoops just to get one additional member of staff or an extra little bit of money for this
POD1000000015_S0000210	where it does work well and where i think the corporate body really try hard for myself and other parliamentary crown appointments
POD1000000015_S0000211	is they hold a contingency fund to which we can apply
POD1000000015_S0000212	for unexpected things so if we were judicially reviewed we could get legal costs through that
POD1000000015_S0000213	and that works well to point we had some unexpected i t costs this year which we were able to go to the contingency fund
POD1000000015_S0000214	but generally i i think ombudsman across the u k are underfunded
POD1000000015_S0000215	if we had sufficient funding we wouldn't have backlogs of cases we would be doing things quicker
POD1000000015_S0000216	but we have to make do with where we are at the moment
POD1000000015_S0000217	two final questions rosemary first of all going forward um what's your biggest challenge as the ombudsman
POD1000000015_S0000218	are you an ombuds or are you an ombudsman
POD1000000015_S0000219	i'm happy to be an ombudsman because that's what the legislation says and i know the origins of the word
POD1000000015_S0000220	but equally i don't mind um if other people call me something similar whatever they're comfortable with
POD1000000015_S0000221	it's the spirit of what we do that's really important
POD1000000015_S0000222	i think my biggest challenge and the biggest challenge for my office is a combination of resourcing and the whistleblowing work that's coming next year
POD1000000015_S0000223	that's fundamentally different in some ways
POD1000000015_S0000224	would you have regulatory powers
POD1000000015_S0000225	my powers will be very similar as they are to ombudsman
POD1000000015_S0000226	right
POD1000000015_S0000228	this is big
POD1000000015_S0000229	yeah
POD1000000015_S0000230	and it's very different from what happens in england
POD1000000015_S0000231	it's it's almost two similar but completely distinct functions
POD1000000015_S0000232	there're two different titles that go with them ombudsman and independent national whistleblowing officer
POD1000000015_S0000234	so as a result of that
POD1000000015_S0000235	i don't know
POD1000000015_S0000237	i say i would like one ah i do the job anyway
POD1000000015_S0000238	but i suppose for me the issue of the pay is not so much for my tenure but for future ombudsman
POD1000000015_S0000239	because i have a real concern across in in common with fellow ombudsman in the u k the
POD1000000015_S0000240	if you don't pay your ombudsman enough to attract good ombudsman you can't forever rely on what i think has happened so far
POD1000000015_S0000241	just ah in scotland we've just got good people who've been attracted to the work
POD1000000015_S0000242	yeah
POD1000000015_S0000243	so i hope they up the pay but if it's not for me i don't mind
POD1000000015_S0000244	what does the legislation say about second terms for ombuds
POD1000000015_S0000245	in scotland there are on their second terms
POD1000000015_S0000246	so you after five years you have to move on do you
POD1000000015_S0000247	i
POD1000000015_S0000249	so it under um public sector law it can be four to eight years
POD1000000015_S0000250	so as information commissioner i actually had a six-year tenure this one is eight years
POD1000000015_S0000251	but at the point that i became ombudsman it was already known that we would be taking on the whistleblowing so it's probably right for that
POD1000000015_S0000252	because just the the nearly three years getting to the point of knowing what the legislation is going to say has been over and the blink of an eye
POD1000000015_S0000253	okay last question we're in manchester this is a young thriving organisation full of young graduates who've just come into the ombudsman world
POD1000000015_S0000254	perhaps a hundred and twenty young graduates in the last eighteen months
POD1000000015_S0000255	you're an experienced highly respected member of the profession if i can call it that
POD1000000015_S0000256	what what would be your advice to my colleagues just coming into the ombuds field
POD1000000015_S0000257	don't ever lose sight of the passion of what drives you to do the right thing for the right reasons
POD1000000015_S0000258	but leave ombudsmanning for a while and go and do something else and come back to it
POD1000000015_S0000259	so that you can see just how wonderful a values-based organisation is but also so you have a different perspective on world experiences
POD1000000015_S0000260	that's lovely rosemary it's been a great privilege for us to listen to you
POD1000000015_S0000261	thank you very much indeed
POD1000000015_S0000262	it's been a pleasure to be here rob
POD1000000015_S0000264	thank you for listening to radio ombudsman we would love to know what you think so please leave a review or comment
POD1000000015_S0000265	if you like what you hear please share and subscribe to future episodes
POD1000000016_S0000001	it's quiet out here there're seagulls
POD1000000016_S0000003	the sun is warm but it's not too humid it's actually kind of a great day for fishing
POD1000000016_S0000005	why it stinks
POD1000000016_S0000007	yeah what does it smell like
POD1000000016_S0000008	it smells like dead fish
POD1000000016_S0000010	it smells like the water
POD1000000016_S0000012	what is going through your head right now
POD1000000016_S0000014	i don't know thinking about what they they went through
POD1000000016_S0000016	i don't know i just wonder a lot what it was what it was like
POD1000000016_S0000018	they say our people were born on the water
POD1000000016_S0000020	when it occurred no one can say for certain perhaps it was in the second week or the third but surely by the fourth
POD1000000016_S0000021	when they had not seen their land or any land for so many days that they lost count
POD1000000016_S0000023	it was after the fear had turned to despair and the despair to resignation and the resignation gave way finally to resolve
POD1000000016_S0000025	they knew then that they would not hug their grandmothers again or share a laugh with a cousin during his nuptials or sing their baby softly to sleep with the same lullabies that their mothers had once sung to them
POD1000000016_S0000027	the teal eternity of the atlantic ocean had severed them so completely that it was as if nothing had ever existed before
POD1000000016_S0000029	that everything they ever knew had simply vanished from the earth
POD1000000016_S0000031	some could not bear the realization
POD1000000016_S0000033	they heaved themselves over the walls of wooden ships to swim one last time with their ancestors
POD1000000016_S0000035	others refused to eat mouths clamped shut until their hearts gave out
POD1000000016_S0000037	but in the suffocating hull of a ship called the white lion bound for where they did not know
POD1000000016_S0000038	those who refused to die understood that the men and women chained next to them in the dark were no longer strangers
POD1000000016_S0000040	they had been forged in trauma
POD1000000016_S0000042	they had been made black by those who believed themselves to be white
POD1000000016_S0000044	and where they were headed black equaled slave
POD1000000016_S0000046	so these were their people now
POD1000000016_S0000048	what happened here um
POD1000000016_S0000050	i mean we really don't know a lot
POD1000000016_S0000052	a pirate ship by the name of white lion sails into the bay here
POD1000000016_S0000053	and they needed to trade something of value so that they could get supplies to make the rest of their journey and what they traded were twenty to thirty africans
POD1000000016_S0000054	and this would be at this place um kind of ironically called point comfort where slavery in the british north american colonies that would go on to become the united states begins
POD1000000016_S0000056	from the new york times magazine i'm nikole hannah-jones this is sixteen nineteen
POD1000000016_S0000059	that's your happy valentine's day nikole this is a tape for nikole
POD1000000016_S0000060	hello darling how you doing excuse me while i partake of this cancer stick
POD1000000016_S0000061	that's okay
POD1000000016_S0000062	when i was a child my dad always flew a flag in our front yard our house is on a corner lot and in the front yard right in the corner was this
POD1000000016_S0000063	i couldn't tell you how tall it was it always seemed really garishly tall to me at the time ah there was this very tall aluminum flagpole my parents didn't make a lot of money so our house always had paint chipping
POD1000000016_S0000064	and there was always something about the house that was in disarray you know the grass was looking disheveled or the railing on the stairs was falling off but the flag was always pristine
POD1000000016_S0000065	as soon as it started to show even the slightest tatter my dad would replace the flag with a fresh new flag
POD1000000016_S0000066	he would never allow a tattered flag to fly and i didn't understand it i i didn't know other black kids whose parents were flying a flag in their front yard
POD1000000016_S0000067	i know lots of white people who flew flags lots of white people who flew flags
POD1000000016_S0000069	my dad was born on a sharecropping farm in greenwood mississippi where his family picked cotton in the same cotton fields that enslaved people had picked cotton not too long before
POD1000000016_S0000070	that county leflore county in mississippi lynched more black people than any other county in mississippi and mississippi lynched more black people than any other state in the country
POD1000000016_S0000071	so it was a pretty devastatingly violent and hard place to live
POD1000000016_S0000073	my dad's mom fled the south like millions of other black people during the great migration and came north to waterloo and found many of the same barriers that she had sought to escape
POD1000000016_S0000074	she was forced to buy a house on the black side of town most jobs were unavailable to her so she cleaned white people's houses my father went to segregated schools
POD1000000016_S0000075	and at a young age my father joined the military so that he could get his way out of poverty but also for the reasons that so many black people join the military
POD1000000016_S0000076	which is he hoped that if he served his country his country might finally see him as an american
POD1000000016_S0000077	he loved being in the army he was stationed in germany picked up german very quickly he was so smart
POD1000000016_S0000078	he loved talking about that time it was a period where he got to see things that a poor black child born in mississippi would not normally get to see
POD1000000016_S0000079	but the military didn't end up being a way out for my dad for long um he was passed up for opportunities
POD1000000016_S0000080	and the only jobs my dad ever worked were service jobs he worked as a convenience store clerk or a bus driver and because of that
POD1000000016_S0000081	this big pristine american flag flying in the front of our yard was deeply embarrassing to me
POD1000000016_S0000082	and i didn't understand why he would feel that much love for a country that clearly did not love him
POD1000000016_S0000084	i felt this way all through high school i was no longer standing for the national anthem i had stopped saying the pledge of allegiance and really
POD1000000016_S0000085	throughout most of my adult life i mean clearly i know i'm an american
POD1000000016_S0000086	i was born here every family member for generations back that i know were all born here but i never felt like i could claim fully that i was an american
POD1000000016_S0000088	but it wasn't until i really started researching and reading and thinking about this project that my own thinking started to shift
POD1000000016_S0000089	that i realized my dad understood things that i never knew
POD1000000016_S0000090	i now understand for the first time why my dad was so proud to fly that flag
POD1000000016_S0000093	my name is fountain hughes i was born in charlottesville virginia
POD1000000016_S0000094	my grandfather belonged to thomas jefferson my grandfather was one hundred fifteen years old when he died and now i am one hundred and one year old
POD1000000016_S0000095	now in my boy days we were slaves we belonged to people they'd sell us like they sell horses and cows and hogs and all like that have an auction bench
POD1000000016_S0000096	put you up on the bench and bid on you the same as you're bidding on cattle you know
POD1000000016_S0000097	but still i don't like to talk about it because it makes makes people feel bad you know
POD1000000016_S0000099	so you kind of have to put yourself in the scene it is june of seventeen seventy-six and thomas jefferson
POD1000000016_S0000100	at the very young age of thirty-three years old has been tasked with drafting the document that is going to declare to the world why the british north american colonies the thirteen colonies want to break off from the british empire
POD1000000016_S0000101	he goes to philadelphia and rents two rooms on the edge of town along the river and sits down to draft what we all know now as the declaration of independence
POD1000000016_S0000102	when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another
POD1000000016_S0000104	so he's sitting at this portable mahogany writing desk that he carries with him and he pulls out some paper and a very nice quill pen
POD1000000016_S0000105	and he starts to write these words that almost every american can recite by heart
POD1000000016_S0000106	the declaration of independence we hold these truths to be self-evident
POD1000000016_S0000108	they become some of the most famous words in the english language
POD1000000016_S0000109	that they are endowed by their creator with certain
POD1000000016_S0000111	life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness that's what makes us unique that's what makes us strong the shared values that we all hold so deep
POD1000000016_S0000113	but what most americans don't know is that while he's writing these lofty words for liberation
POD1000000016_S0000114	he had brought with him one of the many enslaved people whom he owned in order to serve him and to keep him comfortable now that enslaved person was a teenager
POD1000000016_S0000115	and that teenager was the half-brother of thomas jefferson's wife what that means is thomas jefferson's father-in-law had children with one of the women that he enslaved
POD1000000016_S0000116	so actually he was thomas jefferson's brother-in-law and so as he's writing these ideals he knows that they will not apply even to his own family members
POD1000000016_S0000118	at that time that thomas jefferson is drafting the declaration a hundred and fifty years have passed since those first africans were sold into virginia
POD1000000016_S0000119	the enslaved population has grown from twenty to now five hundred thousand people fully one-fifth of the population is now enslaved
POD1000000016_S0000120	it has grown from a conditional institution where some of those first twenty were able to become free after a term of time to one where black people are born into it
POD1000000016_S0000121	they die into it and they pass that status on to their children you now have generations of black people who have never known a day of freedom and who will never know a day of freedom
POD1000000016_S0000122	and yet when thomas jefferson's contemporaries talk in public about why the colonists need to be free from england they refer to themselves as slaves
POD1000000016_S0000123	and slaves to the king of england and so the colonists are being criticized in newspapers for this obvious duplicity by those who don't believe that they should break off from the british empire
POD1000000016_S0000124	one of them writes how is it that we hear the loudest yelps for freedom from the drivers of negroes another writes to benjamin franklin and says perhaps you should ask the people who are actually enslaved what slavery is like
POD1000000016_S0000125	thomas jefferson of course is deeply aware of the hypocrisy and aware of the criticism of the hypocrisy so as he's drafting the declaration
POD1000000016_S0000126	include the passage in there where he actually blames the king of england for introducing slavery into the colonies he calls slavery a crime and he says that the king of england committed this crime
POD1000000016_S0000127	but that's not our fault it was not our doing this is just one more thing that the king of england did to wrong us so he brings this document to the continental congress
POD1000000016_S0000128	and it doesn't take long before delegates from the carolinas and from georgia look at that language about slavery and one can imagine they said what the hell are you doing
POD1000000016_S0000129	and they say that there is no way that they are gonna sign this document as long as that passage about slavery remains and so it is struck and the thirteen colonies sign the declaration
POD1000000016_S0000130	and the declaration goes out into the world without mentioning slavery at all and we start the revolutionary war
POD1000000016_S0000132	somehow miraculously these thirteen scrappy colonies managed to defeat one of the most powerful empires in the world and we become a new nation
POD1000000016_S0000133	and so the colonists gather and they try to figure out the language that they are gonna create in the founding document that we of course come to know as the constitution but now they have a problem
POD1000000016_S0000134	they were trying to leave behind an old country that they believed was antithetical to freedom and create a new one that they believe will be defined by freedom
POD1000000016_S0000135	this was a country that was going to be based on individual rights on a government of the people for the people and by the people
POD1000000016_S0000136	but this was also a place that at this time was still practicing the institution of slavery
POD1000000016_S0000137	and so the colonists have a choice to make are they going to be the country of their ideals the ideals that they were putting to paper a country based on the idea that all men were created equal
POD1000000016_S0000138	and if they were going to be that country then they were going to have to abolish the institution of slavery or were they gonna be wedded to the institution of slavery because they depended so heavily on the wealth that was being generated from it
POD1000000016_S0000139	and in that case they can't really write the document that they want to write and so what they do is they decide that they are going to try to have it both ways
POD1000000016_S0000140	and they bake that contradiction right into the constitution both codifying and protecting the institution of slavery but never actually mentioning the word
POD1000000016_S0000141	and so they have written what is perhaps the most radical constitution in the world and from the beginning they knew they were going to violate its most essential principles
POD1000000016_S0000143	they call this new country a democracy but it wasn't one not yet
POD1000000016_S0000145	on august fourteen eighteen sixty-two abraham lincoln invites five free black men to the white house for a meeting
POD1000000016_S0000146	they are part of the black elite in washington d c and he wants to have a conversation with them
POD1000000016_S0000147	the civil war has been going on for about a year and abraham lincoln is worried because the war is not going well and because it's not going well he's feeling like he might have to do something drastic
POD1000000016_S0000148	he's considering taking this very radical step of liberating all of the enslaved people who are in the confederate states
POD1000000016_S0000149	and he's thinking about doing this as a war tactic understanding that if he takes away the south's labor force that might cripple them or at least the threat of it would force them to remain in the union
POD1000000016_S0000150	but he's also concerned about what it might mean to suddenly free four million enslaved people and what the consequences of that might be
POD1000000016_S0000152	i can imagine these five distinguished men are very excited to get lincoln's invitation they are abolitionists they have been pressuring lincoln to abolish slavery
POD1000000016_S0000153	but when they get there they are greeted by president lincoln and another man his name is james mitchell now james mitchell is a new employee he's only been at the white house for a couple of days
POD1000000016_S0000154	and his job is a new job and it's called commissioner of emigration now that's emigration with an e meaning his job was not to help people to enter the country but to help people to exit it
POD1000000016_S0000156	lincoln doesn't waste any time according to documents that recount what happened that day
POD1000000016_S0000158	he tells the men that he had gotten funds from congress to ship black people once they had been freed to some other country
POD1000000016_S0000160	and then lincoln said you and we are different races your race suffer very greatly many of them by living among us while ours suffer from your presence
POD1000000016_S0000161	in a word he said we suffer on each side
POD1000000016_S0000163	we are taught to think of abraham lincoln as the great emancipator and he was but the truth is like many white americans he was opposed to slavery because it was a cruel and unjust institution in opposition to this nation's ideals
POD1000000016_S0000164	but he was also opposed to black political and social equality as he said in a speech that he gave in eighteen fifty-three he considered black people a quote troublesome presence
POD1000000016_S0000165	and that they were incompatible with a democracy that was designed for white people as he said in that speech free them and make them politically and socially our equals my own feelings will not admit of this and if mine would
POD1000000016_S0000166	we well know that those of a great mass of white people will not
POD1000000016_S0000168	as those five black men stood in the white house i wonder what it must have felt like
POD1000000016_S0000170	these men had been fighting for the liberation of millions and had waited for this moment only to be told that once they were granted their freedom they were going to be asked to leave the country of their birth
POD1000000016_S0000172	and to make it even worse lincoln then tells them that it's their fault that the country is fighting a civil war at all
POD1000000016_S0000173	he says although many men engaged on either side do not care for you one way or the other without the institution of slavery and the colored race as a basis the war could not have an existence
POD1000000016_S0000174	that's why the president said it is better for us both therefore to be separated
POD1000000016_S0000176	so lincoln ends the meeting and one of the men tells him that they will go back and consider his proposal lincoln then tells them take your full time no hurry at all
POD1000000016_S0000178	after that meeting those men made it clear that they were not interested in taking lincoln up on his offer to leave the country of their birth
POD1000000016_S0000180	there's a quote by a different group of black abolitionists that really sums up the way that most black americans felt and that quote said this is our home and this is our country
POD1000000016_S0000181	beneath its side lie the bones of our fathers here we were born and here we will die
POD1000000016_S0000183	after everything that black americans have been through in this country that they didn't immediately take up lincoln's offer and go somewhere else and start over is really an astounding testimony to their belief in the american ideals
POD1000000016_S0000185	by choosing to stay black people were saying this is our country we are american and we're actually going to work to make these founding ideals a reality
POD1000000016_S0000187	and in the years that followed after the civil war ends a very short period called reconstruction began
POD1000000016_S0000189	and so you see the formerly enslaved pushing their white allies in congress to start to change our founding documents and to actually resolve those contradictions that were baked in
POD1000000016_S0000190	they do this through getting amendments passed and of course amendments are the way that we change our constitution
POD1000000016_S0000192	so of course the very first amendment that they have to pass is the thirteenth amendment which abolishes the institution of slavery
POD1000000016_S0000193	and what's interesting about that is this is actually the first time that the word slavery is mentioned in the constitution is in the amendment that finally abolishes it
POD1000000016_S0000195	it also ensures for the first time that the laws cannot treat people differently based on their race this is called the equal protection clause
POD1000000016_S0000196	and this clause will be used again and again really all the way up until now to guarantee that all americans are treated as equal citizens
POD1000000016_S0000198	and finally they pass the fifteenth amendment which probably is the most important amendment when we're considering what a democracy is supposed to be the fifteenth amendment guaranteed the right to vote no matter what your race is
POD1000000016_S0000199	now it didn't include women at that time but it certainly set the stage and it for the first time guaranteed that whether you were born a person who was enslaved whether you were white or you were black you had the right to exercise your vote in this democracy
POD1000000016_S0000201	the only reason we saw all of these gains in the south was because there were federal troops there and those federal troops were holding back the violence of white southerners who were not interested in seeing these gains
POD1000000016_S0000202	this all changes with the presidential election of eighteen seventy-six
POD1000000016_S0000204	it was a contested election and rutherford b hayes is the republican candidate and remember back then it was republicans who were the progressive party and they were the party of lincoln that was working to pass all of this progressive legislation
POD1000000016_S0000206	but rutherford b hayes really wants to win this election
POD1000000016_S0000207	and so he makes a deal with the democrats in congress that if they give him their electoral votes he will withdraw the federal troops from the south and end reconstruction
POD1000000016_S0000209	so he makes the deal and the troops leave and we immediately see white southerners implement a campaign to force black people back into the position that they had been in before reconstruction
POD1000000016_S0000211	the suppression of black life over the next five decades would be so devastating that it would come to be known as the great nadir the second slavery
POD1000000016_S0000213	tell you the truth when i think over today i don't know how i'm living i'm the oldest one that i know that's living but still i'm thankful to the lord
POD1000000016_S0000215	colored people is free we ought to be awful thankful
POD1000000016_S0000217	if i thought that i'd ever be a slave again i'd take a gun and just end it all right away because you're nothing but a dog
POD1000000016_S0000219	you're not a thing but a dog
POD1000000016_S0000221	the day of days for america and her allies crowds before the white house await the announcement
POD1000000016_S0000222	i have received this afternoon a message from the japanese government which specifies the unconditional surrender of japan
POD1000000016_S0000223	reporters rush out to relay the news to an anxious world and touch off celebrations throughout the country joy is unconfined
POD1000000016_S0000225	it's february of nineteen forty-six and a young black man is sitting on a bus watching the georgia pines fly past the windows he's on his way to see his wife and he's probably very excited because he's been away at war and he hasn't seen her in a very long time
POD1000000016_S0000226	he'd been fighting for this country in world war two and just that day he'd been honorably discharged for his service but he is a black man who is returning to the jim crow south
POD1000000016_S0000228	what happened on that day is a story that will be told across the country
POD1000000016_S0000229	good morning this is orson welles speaking i'd like to read to you an affidavit
POD1000000016_S0000230	it was a story that would actually change the course of history
POD1000000016_S0000232	he's riding the bus through georgia
POD1000000016_S0000234	he wants to get off and use the restroom
POD1000000016_S0000236	the bus driver gets upset with him they have a little bit of an argument woodard doesn't think much of it he goes to the bathroom runs back to the bus and the bus keeps going but then a few miles down the road the bus stops
POD1000000016_S0000237	and the bus driver gets off the bus and then calls and tells woodard that he needs to get off the bus as well so woodard gets off the bus and before he can even utter a word
POD1000000016_S0000239	he's struck in the head by a police officer
POD1000000016_S0000241	and the blows keep coming and he coming to the point that woodard loses consciousness
POD1000000016_S0000243	woodard is still wearing his crisp army uniform he's been discharged just a few hours earlier when he comes to he's in a jail
POD1000000016_S0000245	i woke up next morning and could not see
POD1000000016_S0000246	he was beaten so severely by that police officer that he would never see again
POD1000000016_S0000248	so woodard's beating was not at all unusual world war two had done exactly what many white people had feared
POD1000000016_S0000249	that once black people were allowed to fight in the military and when they traveled abroad and they experienced what it was like not to live under a system of racial apartheid that it would be much harder to control them when they came back
POD1000000016_S0000250	black men in their uniforms were seen as being unduly proud so these men who had served their country who had come home proudly wearing the uniform to show their service for their country
POD1000000016_S0000251	would find that this actually made them a target of some of the most severe violence but what was unusual was what happened after woodard's case was picked up by the n double a c p and they take him on a bit of a tour
POD1000000016_S0000252	where they're saying look what happened to this man who served his country
POD1000000016_S0000254	and that's largely seen as one of the sparks of the modern civil rights movement
POD1000000016_S0000256	the second sustained movement of black people trying to secure equal rights before the law and an equal place in this democracy
POD1000000016_S0000258	and in nineteen sixty-eight three hundred and fifty years after the introduction of the first enslaved africans into the colonies
POD1000000016_S0000260	congress passes the last of the great civil rights legislation
POD1000000016_S0000262	it ends legal discrimination on the basis of race from all aspects of american life
POD1000000016_S0000264	we often think of the civil rights movement as being about black rights but the civil rights movement was never just about the rights of black people it was about making the ideals of the constitution whole
POD1000000016_S0000265	and so when you look at the laws born out of black resistance these laws are guaranteeing rights for all americans
POD1000000016_S0000266	this experience which black americans were having did not go unnoticed by the rest of america
POD1000000016_S0000267	i mean basically every other rights struggle that we have seen
POD1000000016_S0000269	disability rights gay rights women's rights
POD1000000016_S0000270	that people with disabilities were still victims of segregation and discrimination
POD1000000016_S0000271	all come from the efforts of the black civil rights struggles
POD1000000016_S0000274	so we are raised to think about seventeen seventy-six as the beginning of our democracy but when that ship arrives on the horizon at point comfort in sixteen nineteen
POD1000000016_S0000275	that decision made by the colonists to purchase that group of twenty to thirty human beings that was a beginning too
POD1000000016_S0000276	and it would actually be those very people who were denied citizenship in their own country who were denied the protections of our founding documents who would fight the hardest and most successfully to make those ideals real
POD1000000016_S0000277	not just for themselves but for all americans it is black people who have been the perfectors of this democracy
POD1000000016_S0000279	when i was a kid it must have been in fifth or sixth grade our teacher gave us an assignment it was a social studies class and we were learning about different places that people came from
POD1000000016_S0000280	and this was her way of kind of telling the story of the great american melting pot so she told us all to research our ancestral land and to write a small report about it and then to draw a flag
POD1000000016_S0000281	i remember kind of looking up and making eye contact with the other black girl who was in the class because we didn't really have an ancestral land that we knew of
POD1000000016_S0000282	slavery had made it so that we didn't know where we came from in africa we didn't have a specific country and we could say that we were from the whole continent
POD1000000016_S0000283	but even so there's no such thing as an african flag and so i remember going to the globe by my teacher's desk it was on the windowpane along the left side of the classroom
POD1000000016_S0000284	and spinning it to the continent of africa and just picking a random african country
POD1000000016_S0000285	so i went back to my desk and i drew that random african country's flag and i wrote a report about it and i felt ashamed i felt ashamed one because i was lying
POD1000000016_S0000286	but i also felt ashamed because i felt like i should have some other country and that all the other kids could trace their roots elsewhere and i could only trace my roots to the country that had enslaved us
POD1000000016_S0000287	i wish now that i could go back and talk to my younger self and tell her that she should not be ashamed
POD1000000016_S0000288	that this is her ancestral home that she should be as proud to be an american as her dad was
POD1000000016_S0000289	and that she should boldly and proudly draw those stars and stripes and claim this country as her own
POD1000000019_S0000000	this episode of cocaine and rhinestones is the second episode in a three part series on harper valley p t a
POD1000000019_S0000001	if this is the first episode of the podcast you're listening to i would recommend going back and at least listening to last week's episode before this one even if you're just a huge jeannie c riley fan and you don't even know who shall be singleton is
POD1000000019_S0000002	have you haven't heard last week's episode you'll be missing out on a lot of context and i'm not going to be doing very much recapping
POD1000000019_S0000004	ah last week we spent some time looking at how far outside of the box shelby singleton was willing to go for a hit song now are we sure we know what a hit song is how to define it
POD1000000019_S0000006	it's safe to say any song that hits the top ten could be called a hit right okay this past may when i began working on this podcast i spent about a week listening to every song to ever go number one on the billboard country chart
POD1000000019_S0000007	in chronological order from the first year the chart existed in nineteen forty-four until this show's cut-off point in the year two thousand
POD1000000019_S0000008	i needed to make sure i'd heard them all to build a timeline of what happened in the mainstream of country music in the nineteen hundreds there were quite a few songs i'd never heard before
POD1000000019_S0000009	unless you've purposefully sat down to give yourself the same experience or spent the past seventy something years of your life glued to country radio the same thing is true for you number one songs hit songs completely absent from our personal experience of country music
POD1000000019_S0000010	even when the song at number one the week before or the week after is one of our favorite songs of all time now imagine how many top ten hits between nineteen forty-four and the year two thousand we haven't heard
POD1000000019_S0000011	probably hundreds of hit country songs you've never heard in your life i've never heard in my life so we can say all hits are not created equal not in the mind of the audience and definitely not in the mind of the record industry
POD1000000019_S0000012	i should give a disclaimer here that commercial success is obviously not everything obviously not a gauge of artistic merit
POD1000000019_S0000013	there are brilliant country artists who've never had a hit in their lives that's not what we're talking about today
POD1000000019_S0000014	but if we're saying top ten singles are hits and i believe we should say that then just having hits wasn't enough for this industry you had to have more hits bigger hits it was called the record industry
POD1000000019_S0000015	move units make money or get out of the way for the next artist who will always be scaling up anything that isn't as good as or better than the last thing you did
POD1000000019_S0000016	you might as well have not done it and you'll probably end up wishing you hadn't
POD1000000019_S0000017	i think the worst thing that could happen to a country recording artist in this climate is for their very first single to become a number one hit you can't do any better than that the only way to improve on that is to stay number one for more weeks
POD1000000019_S0000018	sell more copies even if you manage to do that it's only a matter of time until you put out a song that only goes to number two or number five
POD1000000019_S0000019	but that's still a hit oh sure sure it is or maybe it's the beginning of the end maybe you just don't have the stuff anymore kiddo we gotta get those numbers back up to where they were or well it ain't gonna be good
POD1000000019_S0000020	imagine you're a new country artist and your very first single goes number one country and pop how screwed do you think you are there aren't many people you can ask about this
POD1000000019_S0000021	billy swan is one jeannie c riley the singer of harper valley p t a is the other one those are the only two people alive who've had their first single go number one country and pop
POD1000000019_S0000022	neither one of them ever had another number one song
POD1000000019_S0000024	i've heard them both called one hit wonders
POD1000000019_S0000025	billy swan never even got back in the top ten although he did also write his one hit i can help and elvis presley recorded that so i assume billy's doing fine
POD1000000019_S0000027	jeannie c riley put out five more top ten hits four of which crossed over into the billboard hot one-hundred these are country songs by the way
POD1000000019_S0000028	none of that stripped-down nashville sound stuff the industry bent over backwards to push at pop audiences jeannie was achieving crossover success with one of the most unsophisticated texas twangs you've ever heard
POD1000000019_S0000029	and a hardcore country sound behind it that's not what one hit wonders do
POD1000000019_S0000031	but because her first single sold maybe six million records
POD1000000019_S0000032	nothing she did after that mattered
POD1000000019_S0000034	jeannie carolyn stephenson was born in a small texas town in nineteen forty-five in nineteen sixty-two while still a senior in high school she married her boyfriend mickey riley and became jeannie carolyn riley so c stands for carolyn
POD1000000019_S0000035	her uncle was a country guitar player and songwriter nobody you'd know but in the tiny town of anson texas just the fact that he'd gone to nashville to record in a real studio was a big deal
POD1000000019_S0000036	or at least jeannie seems to think people thought so her husband mickey knew it was jeannie's dream to move to nashville and become a famous singer he was supportive of that
POD1000000019_S0000037	but they decided to wait until jeannie finished high school and save some money for the move then jeannie found out she was pregnant and they had a baby in nineteen sixty-six
POD1000000019_S0000038	yes that is four years after they got married and unless it took jeannie four years to pass twelve grade the math doesn't add up at all for her to use the baby as an excuse for why they stayed in texas i'll get to it in a second
POD1000000019_S0000040	one day jeannie says she gets a letter from the great pedal steel player weldon myrick who'd seen her sing at a local jamboree and just had to write her to say that he thought of jeannie's singing every time he heard connie smith sing
POD1000000019_S0000041	once a day
POD1000000019_S0000043	now in just a minute you may decide jeannie's making this part up but it is possible that it's true later you will hear she was able to sing in a somewhat similar style to connie smith so weldon's letter gives her a little encouragement
POD1000000019_S0000044	the next time uncle johnny goes to nashville he invites the entire family on the trip and they go still in nineteen sixty-six here thirteen people pile into two cars to make the trip
POD1000000019_S0000045	up in nashville they drive around lower broadway to look at tootsie's orchid lounge ernest tubb's record shop and the ryman auditorium all that country music tourist stuff
POD1000000019_S0000046	uncle johnny gets them backstage at the grand ole opry and jeannie's all starstruck she gets an autograph from connie smith jackie phelps the guy you'd later see playing guitar on hee haw takes uncle johnny aside to give him some advice
POD1000000019_S0000047	your little niece is a pretty country girl and i'd like to save her and her husband some heartache if she's got talent tell her she doesn't have to sell her body to make it to the top she can make it if she knows the right people
POD1000000019_S0000048	but if she gets in with the wrong crowd they'll destroy her and her home too
POD1000000019_S0000049	you listening to cocaine and rhinestones the podcast about twentieth century country music and the lives of those who gave it to us
POD1000000019_S0000050	my name is tyler mahan coe i've heard these stories my whole life as far as i can tell okay freeze
POD1000000019_S0000051	jeannie c riley's autobiography is really the only source i can use for this stuff and it's super sketchy to say the least
POD1000000019_S0000052	this is the first of several outlandish scenarios where famous people give her incredibly personal advice that is also so extremely specific
POD1000000019_S0000053	it's almost as if they can see into jeannie's actual future mere moments after meeting her for the very first time
POD1000000019_S0000054	you're a professional musician a colleague of yours brings his niece to see a show you take it upon yourself to call the guy aside and tell him to make sure to let his niece know not to be a hooker not likely
POD1000000019_S0000055	jeannie does go on to find herself in some bad situations and i don't doubt for a second that they really happened but believing her about that does not mean i have to believe everything else she says
POD1000000019_S0000056	there's all these run ins with celebrities who seem to have psychic powers the timeline she presents often makes no sense fine but at least one major part of her story is deliberately misrepresented
POD1000000019_S0000057	she is blatantly lying about certain things there's even a note at the beginning of the book about how several names and some details have been changed to protect people
POD1000000019_S0000059	basically it could not be more clear that this autobiography is more like what you'd call an auto-hagiography the hollywood movie version of these events
POD1000000019_S0000060	they might as well have printed base on a true story on the title page i should say this is one of those celebrity autobiographies that's written with the help of an author so you know it's possible this guy had a hand in these embellishments
POD1000000019_S0000061	you can make up your own mind that's what i'll say but this is gonna get real crazy so just please try to remember this
POD1000000019_S0000062	here's an example of a small type of thing that i probably wouldn't even mention if i only noticed it once or twice the book opens with her locking up the office building in nashville where she worked as a secretary
POD1000000019_S0000063	walking over to a recording studio and being greeted by shelby singleton handing her the lyrics of harper valley p t a we've got shelby saying it's just right for your voice tom hall has caught the angry mood of the country let's see if you can make it sing
POD1000000019_S0000064	the problem is as you'll hear in a few minutes the entire week before this jeannie had been arguing with everyone about not liking this song and whether or not it would be released under her own name or a pseudonym
POD1000000019_S0000065	in the very next paragraph she says she'd already studied the lyrics which she would have gotten from shelby why does she have shelby presenting the lyrics to her here with such pomp as if for the very first time
POD1000000019_S0000066	as if she's never heard this song before like i said small thing i would let it slide but this is a death by a thousand cuts situation
POD1000000019_S0000067	there's at least one scene where two people go back and forth with lines of quoted dialogue in a conversation that jeannie was not there for and could not possibly remember with such detail even if she was blessed with total recall over a decade after the fact
POD1000000019_S0000069	there's one more scene where she's driving her car while upset quote half blind from the tears she accidentally speeds over some railroad tracks just ahead of a crossing train and i'm quoting here
POD1000000019_S0000070	the train loomed over me as i roared across the tracks missing my back bumper by less than a foot the vacuum created by the rushing locomotive and the rumbling wheels almost flipped my car over the screeching
POD1000000019_S0000072	um half blind from the tears gets she knows within a twelve inch margin of error how close a train passed to the back bumper of her car so that's what i'm working with here and whatever you'll see
POD1000000019_S0000073	okay we're still in nashville the night jeannie's uncle takes her backstage at the opry when they leave the opry that night doyle wilburn of the wilburn brothers has agreed to listen to jeannie sing
POD1000000019_S0000074	if they'll come by the office of sure fire his publishing company a few days later they drop in to the sure fire office and meet johnny russell who is a staff songwriter there johnny russell listens to her sing
POD1000000019_S0000075	they decide to have her go in the studio that night and the next to record a four song demo tape they have a photographer take some pictures of her jeannie thinks all of this means she's on her way to becoming a star
POD1000000019_S0000076	the second night of recording within forty-eight hours of meeting her johnny russell pulls jeannie and her husband mickey aside to tell them quote i've watched you kids ever since you got here and i need to say something to you
POD1000000019_S0000077	nashville is good to you when you're on top but it's a mean city too this business of wanting to be number one gets in your blood it consumes you until you can't think of anything else it's like drugs only worse
POD1000000019_S0000078	cause there's nothing you can do to get rid of it you'll leave your family you'll leave your self-respect you'll do anything to reach the top and anything to stay there
POD1000000019_S0000079	i've seen it happen too many times most people think they are the exception they come in here with high morals and high ideals and lose them overnight the pressures are too much what i'm saying is this
POD1000000019_S0000080	i don't think jeannie can make it here she's got a good voice and you're a fine young couple but this city will chew you up swallow the juice and spit you out like a dry hull on the street go back to texas and stay there
POD1000000019_S0000081	wow that is one hell of a monologue huh i don't know how anyone gets anything done in the music business when they're delivering fully polished a hundred and fifty word speeches like that to everyone they've known for forty-eight hours
POD1000000019_S0000082	anyway after a week or so the texas crew heads back to texas doyle wilburn had told them the wilburns would be needing a female vocalist for their upcoming september tour of germany jeannie should expect their call
POD1000000019_S0000083	all through july she expects the call all through august she expects the call of course it never comes so she gets all bummed out until mickey comes home from work one day and tells her to start packing he's sick of seeing her mope around the house they're moving to nashville
POD1000000019_S0000084	as they cross the city limits sign into nashville she and mickey make a pact that they'll always travel together as a family the baby too quote show business might chew up other folks and spit them onto the sidewalk but not us we'd show them
POD1000000019_S0000085	we would gonna make it together
POD1000000019_S0000087	this is the end of nineteen sixty-six because of everyone jeannie starts having sex with and the fact that she changes their names
POD1000000019_S0000088	and the names of the companies they work for it gets really confusing to work out the specifics of what happens when and where for the next year
POD1000000019_S0000089	for instance she refers to her first manager paul perry as pete terry through her entire book because of the affair she later has with him this other guy gets named phil blackman and he's a big shot at black rose records
POD1000000019_S0000090	based out of new york phil blackman is our big bad wolf uncle johnny bought a gas station right before jeannie and mickey moved to nashville so that's where mickey starts working
POD1000000019_S0000091	they lived in a motel room than a small apartment jeannie keeps calling sure fire music to find out why they didn't hire her for that wilburn brothers tour she eventually finds out that tour was canceled and then gets to work furthering her career by checking the mailbox
POD1000000019_S0000092	and waiting for the phone to ring she writes that she spends weeks waiting for the world to notice her resenting her husband for working twelve hour days at a gas station to support her and the baby while also begging him to move them to a bigger apartment closer to his work
POD1000000019_S0000094	one day she finally realizes she's gonna have to actually try to get people to care that she exists she gets all dolled up and drives with her baby down to music row to look for this powerful woman she'd heard of who was from a town in texas
POD1000000019_S0000095	twenty-five miles away from where jeannie was from she apparently thinks she can meet this lady say hey i'm from texas too and get a record deal or something
POD1000000019_S0000096	she has no idea where this lady's office is supposed to be she just starts walking into publishing companies to find out if that lady works there or not when some kid asks if she's trying to get a demo tape heard jeannie pulls out her tape and the kid takes a listen
POD1000000019_S0000097	he seems to like it plays it for his boss who says it sounds too much like loretta lynn and they tell jeannie to kick rocks she goes back to her car with the baby and cries then decides to drive over to the gas station where mickey works
POD1000000019_S0000098	when she gets there mickey's talking to a guy named jerry chesnut a rich guy who owns a vacuum cleaner business but also wants to be a songwriter
POD1000000019_S0000099	you've heard the song he'd write a few years after this called a good year for the roses
POD1000000019_S0000101	mickey has a copy of jeannie's demo tape that he plays in the gas station just in case someone important happens to come in and hear it and care
POD1000000019_S0000102	chesnut isn't really important yet but he did strike up a conversation and offer to play the demo tape for his friends at monument records a few days later he calls to say monument is interested
POD1000000019_S0000103	but they want to change jeannie's name because they're already doing well with jeannie seely and let's not get carried away with the jeannies over here right our jeannie's not thrilled about this
POD1000000019_S0000104	but jerry thinks they can get monument to back off the name change if they stay on it jeannie gets shown off at a d j convention introduced to everyone in town as tina stephens the next girl they're gonna sign and do big things with
POD1000000019_S0000105	but then she gets forgotten about because apparently a major female artist on the label doesn't like jeannie or tina or whoever back to square one
POD1000000019_S0000106	jerry chesnut meets a radio d j named paul perry who knows phil blackman a made up name for a real important guy at black rose which is also a made up name for a real record label
POD1000000019_S0000107	remember this sentence that d j paul perry sends jeannie's demo and a promo picture to phil blackman in new york city
POD1000000019_S0000108	blackman expresses interest in recording jeannie when he comes to nashville sometime in january it ends up being early february of nineteen sixty-seven when jeannie walks in to black rose's office for the first time
POD1000000019_S0000109	she writes literally nothing about the conversation only that she finds phil blackman very attractive and she leaves with a contract that night she begins fantasizing that blackman will fall in love with her
POD1000000019_S0000110	within a week in reality they've kissed blackman goes back to new york city for business when he returns a few weeks later he and jeannie start having a full-fledged affair
POD1000000019_S0000111	now i don't like dwelling on this soap opera stuff unless the story cannot be told without it so here's the relevant information that d j named paul perry becomes jeannie's first manager
POD1000000019_S0000112	she technically gets a single released on black rose records but it's only technically released no money is put into promoting it and not even jeannie thinks it's any good
POD1000000019_S0000113	but she does think she and this rich powerful man are in love with each other so she's not too worried about that record
POD1000000019_S0000115	then one day in blackman's apartment jeannie's laying naked on the couch after having sex with him when she's suddenly blinded by flashes of bright light there's blackman holding a camera with a strobe flash attachment
POD1000000019_S0000116	jeannie freaks out he tells her there's no film in the camera she asks if he really loves her he laughs at her says mean things to her about how stupid she is and she leaves crying
POD1000000019_S0000117	fast forward to six months later it's early in the fall of nineteen sixty-six jeannie's in las vegas for a week as johnny paycheck's opener paycheck is on his way up after having his first top ten hit the year before with the lovin machine
POD1000000019_S0000119	phil blackman is also in las vegas but jeannie manages to resist his advances
POD1000000019_S0000120	fast forward again to january of nineteen sixty-eight jeannie gets blackman to release her from her contract so she can go record for little darlin records
POD1000000019_S0000121	this is the record label started by johnny paycheck and his producer aubrey mayhew who had heard jeannie sing in vegas and decided he'd like to record her
POD1000000019_S0000122	aubrey does record her a single is released on little darlin but like the black rose single with phil blackman it's only technically released not really promoted because they vowed wound up in contract difficulties
POD1000000019_S0000123	i will come back to this
POD1000000019_S0000125	meanwhile jerry chesnut has decided to get out of the vacuum cleaner business and all the way in to the music business opening up a music row office for his publishing company
POD1000000019_S0000126	he hires jeannie as a secretary which is where she's working when a songwriter friend asks her to sing on the demo of his new song he wants shelby singleton at plantation records to hear
POD1000000019_S0000127	i couldn't find a recording of jeannie singing it but i found the songwriter singing it himself so you can try to imagine what jeannie would have sounded like on the demo
POD1000000019_S0000128	clark bentley's old town drunk comes out on plantation records in nineteen sixty-eight
POD1000000019_S0000130	when shelby hears the demo he's more interested in the voice of the singer than the song if you listen to last week's episode this is the part where he wants to meet that singer to see if she's got the image he's looking for to sing harper valley p t a
POD1000000019_S0000132	here on jeannie's side she wants to listen to harper valley p t a before she agrees to anything her manager paul perry thinks she's crazy for not getting on board sight unseen but he brings her a tape she doesn't like the song
POD1000000019_S0000133	just doesn't like something about it says it sounds like a soft redo of ode to billie joe now paul perry and all her friends think she's crazy she agrees to meet with shelby and there's something she doesn't like about him too
POD1000000019_S0000134	shelby tells her they can make a pop hit together but they'll have to change her name because there's too many jeannies in nashville same old story he wants to call her rhonda renae
POD1000000019_S0000135	she's thinking about that when perry says if jeannie doesn't take this deal then he can't represent her any more it's not gonna get any better than this she signs the papers goes home and cries about it
POD1000000019_S0000136	her husband mickey comes home to find her upset hears the story about them wanting to change her name calls paul perry and yells at him to tear up the contract jeannie's not doing it
POD1000000019_S0000137	the next day all the business people convince her they'll let her keep her own name if she just comes in on friday after work to record this damn song the entire day friday jeannie's pissed off at the world
POD1000000019_S0000138	she feels like she's being backed into a corner and talked in to doing something she doesn't want to do on top of that she's sure everyone's lying to her about getting to use her real name
POD1000000019_S0000139	still she goes to the studio channels her anger into the song and nails it on the second take
POD1000000019_S0000141	shelby tells jeannie they'll use her middle initial to make her stand out more from the other jeannies and add an i to her first name so people know it's not pronounced jean
POD1000000019_S0000142	finding out she really doesn't have to be rhonda renae plus the fact that everyone in the room seems certain she just cut a massive hit song improves jeannie's mood
POD1000000019_S0000143	she calls her mother at one in the morning to tell her she just recorded a song that's gonna be the number one song in the country
POD1000000019_S0000144	the masters are mixed and sent to the pressing plant on saturday morning jeannie spends monday handwriting hundreds of personalized notes to go with promo copies to d js all over america
POD1000000019_S0000145	anytime she comes to her own name or the name of the song she switches from black ink to red so it stands out on the page a station in ohio plays the single twenty-six times in one day other stations ban it because they don't like her uppity tone
POD1000000019_S0000146	love it or hate it everyone talks about it according to jeannie she and mickey take a copy over to ralph emery at w s m
POD1000000019_S0000147	this doesn't necessarily conflict with jerry kennedy's story about shelby taking over an acetate the night of the session jeannie would want ralph to have a real copy of the record but then jeannie says ralph tells mickey y'all be really careful
POD1000000019_S0000148	so many families break up as soon as the singer hits the big time
POD1000000019_S0000149	the next friday they're in philadelphia for jeanie to sing her song on t v saturday new york city jeannie's with mickey paul perry and his wife shelby and a dozen other business people from nashville
POD1000000019_S0000150	a real entourage they stay in nice hotels drink champagne order room service and leave huge tips at dinners jeannie doesn't realize how all this works until later
POD1000000019_S0000151	when she finds out she's the one paying for all of that jeannie and mickey don't need the help spending money they're throwing down major cash on clothing jewelry hairstyles cars all the usual rock star stuff
POD1000000019_S0000152	a week after new york they're in florida doing a show with waylon jennings out of nowhere waylon tells jeannie that she won't stay married to mickey for long because he just don't fit the scene
POD1000000019_S0000153	if you ever need to find out exactly what's wrong with your life all you have to do is go stand by a country musician for a few minutes they're all psychic and chomping at the bit to give you advice
POD1000000019_S0000155	anyway pretty soon jeannie starts spending too much time with her manager paul perry one night they're sitting around holding hands and perry's talking about how careful jeannie has to be now that she's on top
POD1000000019_S0000156	he sure hopes she doesn't have anything in her past that could come back to haunt her you know like nudie pictures taken by phil blackman
POD1000000019_S0000158	back in nashville first thing monday morning jeannie heads over to black rose records there's blackman in his office packing up a stack of brand new jeannie c riley records
POD1000000019_S0000159	made from her old sessions with him now that jeannie's got the biggest hit in the nation these records will sell
POD1000000019_S0000160	they argue she demands the naked pictures he plays stupid at first but then says it'll take him a couple days to get them come back wednesday skip to wednesday
POD1000000019_S0000161	blackman's got a manilla envelope like you see in every movie about a private detective and he wants to give it to jeannie but first she's gotta sign a new piece of paper saying she won't sue him for releasing her old recordings
POD1000000019_S0000162	see he's legally allowed to do that and she'll even get paid royalties and everything it's just that he lost their original contract so sign here and here and you can have those pictures
POD1000000019_S0000163	of course she signs the thing then without even looking in the manila envelope she asks him to burn it which he does in front of her by the time she gets home
POD1000000019_S0000164	half an hour later the news is reporting that black rose records has filed a lawsuit against harper valley p t a singer and record label for breach of contract
POD1000000019_S0000165	okay here's the thing phil blackman and aubrey mayhew are at least partially the same person
POD1000000019_S0000166	you do remember aubrey right johnny paycheck's producer that heard jeannie sing in vegas wanted to record her and that's why she got blackman to let her out of her contract in the first place
POD1000000019_S0000167	yeah that's all bullshit
POD1000000019_S0000168	phil blackman and black rose records are not fake names for someone and something that happened before jeannie got involved with aubrey mayhew and little darlin
POD1000000019_S0000169	jeannie tells the same story two different ways as a red herring black rose records is little darlin records
POD1000000019_S0000170	which is also the explanation for why jeannie would be in las vegas opening up for johnny paycheck when all she's supposedly done is one barely released single for black rose records
POD1000000019_S0000171	if you were to rewind this episode and listen to the part about how phil blackman came into jeannie c riley's life you'd be listening to the story of how aubrey mayhew came into her life
POD1000000019_S0000172	you'd be listening to the story of how jeannie c riley came to be signed to little darlin records
POD1000000019_S0000173	i know this because it's described exactly the same way in court documents related to the lawsuit jeannie just told us about
POD1000000019_S0000174	quote as to little darlin records the amended and supplemental bill asserts that prior to the time complainant was incorporated its president aubrey mayhew did business in new york new york
POD1000000019_S0000175	as an individual under the proprietary name of little darlin records that his first knowledge of defendant riley was a letter addressed to him on the date of december eight nineteen sixty-six by paul perry
POD1000000019_S0000176	enclosing the tape and photo mentioned
POD1000000019_S0000177	there was no barely released black rose single before the barely released little darlin single there was one barely released single
POD1000000019_S0000178	the contract difficulties jeannie mentions to explain why her little darlin single suffered the same fate as her black rose single that's this lawsuit the court document sheds more light on this
POD1000000019_S0000179	in response to mayhew's lawsuit jeannie tells the court that mayhew was never convinced she had enough talent to succeed as a recording artist
POD1000000019_S0000180	and did not undertake to produce any records of her voice for general distribution
POD1000000019_S0000181	in other words aubrey mayhew didn't think jeannie was that good of a singer he was using her as little more than a session vocalist for demo tapes he needed done anyway while letting her believe she was a real recording artist
POD1000000019_S0000182	jeannie seems to think that one single was just him going through the motions to string her along and she's probably right
POD1000000019_S0000183	speaking very strictly harper valley p t a is not her debut single as i said it was in the intro of this episode but her first single may never have been meant for an audience larger than her immediate circle of family and friends
POD1000000019_S0000184	something physical for jeannie to play pretend with to keep the whole charade going it was called you write the music credited to jean riley released on little darlin records in nineteen sixty-seven
POD1000000019_S0000186	aubrey's first mistake was signing jeannie to a real recording contract which stipulated that she be recorded four times a year a stipulation not met by using her for demo sessions
POD1000000019_S0000187	his second mistake was releasing her from her contract on april third of nineteen sixty-eight four months before she recorded harper valley p t a
POD1000000019_S0000188	now here are the two big questions i don't think i can or should even try to answer did aubrey mayhew and jeannie c riley have an affair
POD1000000019_S0000189	and did aubrey mayhew take naked photographs of jeannie c riley without her consent and then blackmail her
POD1000000019_S0000190	technically jeannie has never alleged either of these things against aubrey mayhew
POD1000000019_S0000191	that was phil blackman i'm gonna play it safe and point out that it's possible phil blackman is meant as an amalgamation of more than one person
POD1000000019_S0000192	i'm not in any way a professional investigator all i did was read a bunch of publicly available information and match it to what jeannie wrote in her book
POD1000000019_S0000193	as far as i can tell i'm the first reader of jeannie's autobiography who cared enough to take the time to look into this or at least i'm the first one to talk about it
POD1000000019_S0000194	searching jeannie and aubrey's names together only brings up information about them having worked together and information about this lawsuit but listen even if phil blackman is one hundred percent aubrey mayhew
POD1000000019_S0000195	and even if we choose to one hundred percent believe everything jeannie says about him that still doesn't mean aubrey mayhew took those pictures jeannie says she had him burn the envelope without looking inside
POD1000000019_S0000196	she even brings up the possibility herself that the envelope could have been empty
POD1000000019_S0000197	it doesn't look like any pornographic photographs were mentioned in the courtroom at all
POD1000000019_S0000198	the case was ruled in favor of shelby singleton and jeannie c riley
POD1000000019_S0000199	back in the business of promoting their hit single jeannie gets sent to charm school to learn how to walk talk and act onstage
POD1000000019_S0000200	then she's sent on tour concerts talk shows radio shows live t v appearances her hometown names a day in april jeannie c riley day and there's a big ceremony for that
POD1000000019_S0000201	she gets to do pickin wild mountain berries with glen campbell on t v
POD1000000019_S0000203	she gets to live her dream of performing on the grand ole opry
POD1000000019_S0000205	but then she gets her first royalty check and finds out how much of the money being spent is hers basically all of it she's always expected to hang out and be nice to industry people
POD1000000019_S0000206	one night there's a scene with mickey when a random suit at a party is too persistent in trying to get jeannie to dance with him mickey grabs the guy's wrist and tells him to back off
POD1000000019_S0000207	later shelby tells jeannie that mickey needs to stay home if he can't control himself and mickey is banished from the road
POD1000000019_S0000208	if you're starting to get the idea that jeannie's always thought of as little more than a puppet for the people behind the scenes of her career i would say that seems accurate
POD1000000019_S0000210	now aside from the song itself the biggest impact jeannie c riley had on country music with harper valley p t a was in fashion
POD1000000019_S0000212	it seems ridiculous today but in the late sixty that line in the song about the single mother wearing miniskirts that in itself was enough to make a lot of country music fans gasp and turn off the radio
POD1000000019_S0000213	and while the song is actually sung by the daughter character who doesn't dress that way every time you see jeannie c riley she looks like mrs johnson
POD1000000019_S0000215	her style or more accurately the style she was made to wear would best be described as mod like nancy sinatra in her boots are made for walkin phase
POD1000000019_S0000216	way before any other women in country music were dressing that way we're talking miniskirts go-go boots and in october of nineteen sixty-eight the first year the c m a awards were televised
POD1000000019_S0000217	a ridiculous dress
POD1000000019_S0000219	the ruffles start halfway up her rib cage and poof way out like they would to make a bell shape down to the ground but then it all just stops halfway down her thighs showing off legs and high heel cowgirl boots
POD1000000019_S0000221	after seeing the dress but before the show she called shelby singleton to yell at him in the middle of her tirade after she tells him she's not miss harper valley p t a
POD1000000019_S0000222	she's an artist shelby cuts her off to say you're not an artist baby you're a commodity a mini-skirted silver booted commodity now be there early we've got a show to rehearse
POD1000000019_S0000223	that's one exchange that i don't doubt for a second happened just like that
POD1000000019_S0000225	the rest of jeannie's book is about her struggles with infidelity and conversion to religion more people seem to have mystical psychic powers
POD1000000019_S0000226	like after a divorce from mickey a random sales clerk in a department store somewhere stops jeannie to say your ex-husband still loves you god wants you to go back to him bullshit like that
POD1000000019_S0000227	she tells the story of the first time she tries pot having an intensely spiritual vision that sends her into a fugue state for close to twenty-four hours and sounds more like an ayahuasca trip than any weed i've ever smoked
POD1000000019_S0000228	from the nightmare she describes you'd expect that to be the only time she ever toked up but there's a video clip of ralph emery interviewing her seems to suggest otherwise
POD1000000019_S0000230	so i want to get away from her autobiography for the rest of this episode and talk more about the music jeannie made after her hit because that last sentence is pretty typical of the way people talk about jeannie c riley's career
POD1000000019_S0000231	reference to her hit as if she had only one a one hit wonder if you will
POD1000000019_S0000233	while it's true she never took another a song to number one on both pop and country charts not many people have ever done that
POD1000000019_S0000234	the only other woman to do that in the nineteen hundreds is dolly parton with nine to five in nineteen eighty-one making jeannie the first woman to ever do it if you don't count the farce with little darlin records
POD1000000019_S0000235	which you should not she's the only woman to do it with her debut single it's so unfair to judge the rest of her output against that that's like mocking a rookie basketball player for only breaking a world record one time
POD1000000019_S0000236	jeannie's follow up single to harper valley p t a was called the girl most likely
POD1000000019_S0000237	sticking with the formula it's another song about prejudice in a small town this time it's the girl who everyone thought would be the first one to get in that special kind of trouble only a teenage girl can get in
POD1000000019_S0000238	only turns out it's the miss goody two shoes of the town who gets knocked up by the town doctor's son instead
POD1000000019_S0000240	it went to number six on the country chart and number fifty-five on the billboard hot one hundred i would call that a hit song
POD1000000019_S0000242	after that aubrey mayhew put out an album consisting of everything he had sung by jeannie during her time with little darlin
POD1000000019_S0000244	the album is called sock soul i'm guessing in reference to the line in harper valley p t a about how mrs johnson socked it to em
POD1000000019_S0000245	but this stuff was all recorded before anyone thought of jeannie c riley as the loudest voice calling b s on american society so none of the songs fit that album title or her image
POD1000000019_S0000246	the material is good it's just in the same vein being mined by every other female voice in country music
POD1000000019_S0000248	the price i pay to stay barely cracked the country top forty from there her singles were hit or miss if you judge them by commercial results
POD1000000019_S0000249	but even when she released a legitimate hit nobody saw it that way because it wasn't another harper valley p t a
POD1000000019_S0000251	her first proper single released after that little darlin compilation of basically demo recordings was there never was a time
POD1000000019_S0000252	here's her doing it in joni cash show
POD1000000019_S0000254	that song was a top five country hit that also cracked the pop hot one hundred now listen to how great this other single list from the same album as that song the back side of dallas it wasn't a hit but it's a damn good song
POD1000000019_S0000256	up until the mid seventy the quality of her music remained pretty consistent here's her next top ten country girl
POD1000000019_S0000258	she was starting to branch away from the harper valley p t a prototype of getting on a microphone and pointing fingers at
POD1000000019_S0000259	society also letting jeannie multi-track her own harmony vocals was a great way to shut up the critics who liked to say she had no range as a singer
POD1000000019_S0000260	and of course most of these critics were pop writers who were only aware of jeannie c riley because of the pop success of harper valley p t a and whose only other frame of reference for country music in the sixties and seventies was probably johnny cash
POD1000000019_S0000261	like the l a times pop critic robert hilburn who reviewed a jeannie c riley concert in nineteen seventy-one under the headline letter talent
POD1000000019_S0000262	quote jeannie c riley has all the confidence in the world but unfortunately very little of the talent
POD1000000019_S0000263	first of all her voice isn't any good second neither is her material that's two strikes against her and as soon as the public forgets harper valley p t a that's three strikes and she's out
POD1000000019_S0000264	now maybe that guy was having a bad day or something but he doesn't know what the hell he's talking about he's wrong on every single point from everything i've seen jeannie c riley was even better live than on recording
POD1000000019_S0000266	check out this performance of the song you heard just a little bit go back side of dallas
POD1000000019_S0000268	she always had a crack band behind her the harper valley express they usually made the tempo of everything faster to really put some gas in the tank and it's impossible to deny jeannie's charisma as a performer
POD1000000019_S0000270	the song she's singing is about a woman becoming a prostitute and her expressions alternate between sassy and serious in a way that keeps shifting the meaning of the lyrics
POD1000000019_S0000272	those charm school classes paid off she knew how to work a crowd striking poses and flashing twenty different kinds of smile in all the right places
POD1000000019_S0000273	but that l a times review of her concert is the sort of dismissive attitude the pop intelligentsia had towards southern culture
POD1000000019_S0000274	not only was jeannie not a one-hit wonder she made good albums with very little filler check out the album track from nineteen seventy-two never even released as a single called without you
POD1000000019_S0000276	her voice is on the melody is there what more could you want from a country love song this is the kind of track you hope is waiting to surprise you when you buy someone's album based on one or two of the singles
POD1000000019_S0000277	without you is from jeannie's second album on m g m after leaving plantation records in nineteen seventy-two in what shelby singleton called a breach of contract
POD1000000019_S0000278	jeannie's luck in the courtroom held winning this case as well though she maintained for the rest of her career that she was never paid what she believed she was owed for harper valley p t a earnings
POD1000000019_S0000280	her full commitment to christianity seems to have taken place sometime in the seventies
POD1000000019_S0000281	and seems to have caused at least some regret for her previous persona as country music's most blatant sex symbol to date the clothing changed the music took a turn to gospel and
POD1000000019_S0000282	this is purely speculation on my part but it looks to me like money could have really become a problem for her in the early nineteen eighties
POD1000000019_S0000283	that autobiography of hers was published in the year nineteen eighty-one shortly before the release of a gospel album with the same title as the book
POD1000000019_S0000284	generally speaking when a musical artist quote-unquote past their prime puts out an album right after they put out a book
POD1000000019_S0000285	it's safe to assume that book is meant to generate new interest in that artist's music in advance of the new album
POD1000000019_S0000287	in other words it's often a promotional strategy if that's what happened here then the only problem is this book was printed by a small publisher of christian books
POD1000000019_S0000289	it may not be safe to assume that no major publishers were interested and that's why jeannie went with the small christian publisher
POD1000000019_S0000290	however it does seem very safe to assume that this small christian publishing house would mostly if not exclusively have a promotional network meant to get their product in front of conservative christians
POD1000000019_S0000291	a k a the exact opposite audience of the only reason anyone knows jeannie c riley's name harper valley p t a a song highly critical of hypocrisy in social groups with hardcore conservative values
POD1000000019_S0000293	even the music fans who did find the book wouldn't be likely to recommend it to a friend because of how poorly it is written and how most of it is irrelevant to her career in music
POD1000000019_S0000295	people who bought the book because they happened to see it on one of their regular trips to the christian bookstore would no doubt be scandalized by jeannie's rampant infidelity and the pot smoking
POD1000000019_S0000297	the used copy that i have once belonged to a library in new mexico it still has the stamp card in the back i can see here that only four people checked it out in nineteen eighty-one
POD1000000019_S0000298	the year it was published one person in nineteen eighty-two nobody in nineteen eighty-three and one or two readers a year at best from there it was discarded in nineteen eighty-five
POD1000000019_S0000299	having been checked out a grand total of thirteen times not good especially if that was the main plan to get people hyped for that new gospel album
POD1000000019_S0000300	which entirely failed to chart if she had hopes of getting off the road where she seems to have been making most of her income from harper valley to the mountain top as a book album combo did not deliver
POD1000000019_S0000301	next move ask tom t hall to write another harper valley p t a a thing he'd been very vocal about his reluctance to do but also he's a big softie
POD1000000019_S0000302	it's easy to imagine him having a hard time saying no when jeannie came to him about it in nineteen eighty-four tom wrote return to harper valley for her he even made all the lyrics fit jeannie's new christian lifestyle
POD1000000019_S0000304	we're back at harper valley high because our narrator's grandchildren go to the school now and she's bought a ticket to the raffle at a school dance she's wearing a dress that's well below her knees
POD1000000019_S0000305	because just about every character from the original song is now on the straight and narrow
POD1000000019_S0000307	but wouldn't you know it she spots a man giving a cigarette to a school kid and it turns out he's selling drugs in the parking lot there's the drummer of the band doing cocaine and these kids are all getting drunk and taking pills and taking off their clothes
POD1000000019_S0000308	she thinks about going home for her gun but instead decides to go home pray with her bible and you guessed it bring all this up at the next meeting of the harper valley p t a
POD1000000019_S0000309	in short the song is terrible nobody cared at all
POD1000000019_S0000310	even with tom joining jeannie for promo appearances on all the usual t v shows like nashville now
POD1000000019_S0000313	as you heard there seems to have been a sense of urgency in the writing recording and release of the song whatever the reason for the rush and even if bands of the original song had grown to develop more conservative values
POD1000000019_S0000314	there simply wasn't enough interest in this return to generate airplay or sales figures
POD1000000019_S0000316	seven years later in nineteen ninety-one jeannie put out what looks like will be her final formally released single here's to the cowboys
POD1000000019_S0000318	the entire review in billboard is one sentence riley gives a poignant reading of this tribute to cowboys who are committed enough to be domesticated
POD1000000019_S0000320	as some of you may have seen on fox news in two thousands and two somewhere along the line she apparently forgot that she worked with the guy who was probably responsible for creating the elvis is still alive rumors

POD1000000019_S0000329	i love tom t hall based on how many people requested a tom t hall episode as soon as i went public with the show it's safe to say a lot of you do too
POD1000000019_S0000330	of course i had the whole first season written before i released an episode but i've got to say i was pretty surprised that tom t was such an instant demand from everyone i thought i was just making an episode about one of my favorite songwriters
POD1000000019_S0000331	so i'm excited for all you other tom t hall fans out there to get your ears on this one
POD1000000019_S0000332	i don't think i should put an ad in this episode for obvious reasons so what i'm gonna do is tell you about the other podcast i'm doing
POD1000000019_S0000333	the other podcast is called your favorite band sucks it's exactly what it sounds like it is you know it's it's a comedy podcast it's more like other podcasts than this one
POD1000000019_S0000334	cocaine and rhinestones is very scripted very produced it takes me a long time to make these episodes your favorite band sucks is the exact opposite it's just my friend mark and i sit down and say some of the worst things you will ever hear about bands that you probably love
POD1000000019_S0000335	it should be available in itunes and everywhere by now or you can go listen to it at y f b as pot dot com
POD1000000019_S0000336	our first three episodes are out now we did an episode on the beatles an episode on the rolling stones
POD1000000019_S0000337	and an episode on christmas music
POD1000000019_S0000338	ah yeah enjoy it
POD1000000019_S0000339	all right here are the liner notes for jeannie c riley
POD1000000019_S0000340	i had no idea when i was in four when i began this episode and i'll tell you right now that i have no idea what the truth is here
POD1000000019_S0000341	just wow ah
POD1000000019_S0000342	i don't even know what i'm really allowed to say right now but i guess if i'm gonna get in trouble for this and i probably already crossed that line so ah
POD1000000019_S0000343	i know there are lies in this episode because i told you which ones i found out about but i have no idea what else is or isn't a lie
POD1000000019_S0000344	all i can tell you is that i did not knowingly perpetuate a lie when i'm reading a book i pretty much always save the previous and forward stuff until after i read the book
POD1000000019_S0000345	because there have been a few times reading some classic novel or something where the person writing the foreword some scholar or someone assumes everyone must have already read this book before
POD1000000019_S0000346	and they drop major's boilers right there before you even read the first page so out of habit i just never read that stuff in the beginning of the book if the book's good i'll usually go back and read it or if i'm just like what the hell did i just read that i'll go back and read it
POD1000000019_S0000347	and that that second scenario was very much the case with jeannie c riley's book by this second page of the book when she was putting those words and show we singleton's mouth and it just didn't seem like the way he talked to me
POD1000000019_S0000348	and it didn't make sense the way that she was having him act based on other information she was giving you at the same time i had feeling something was up
POD1000000019_S0000349	then a little bit later she's writing about having just married mickey while she's still in high school i'll just read it to you out of the book this is a quote
POD1000000019_S0000350	mickey and i move into a smaller apartment and struggled each month to make it on his salary we postpone going to nashville until i graduated from high school and we could save some money
POD1000000019_S0000351	i was at the doctor's office for a checkup when he told me he thought i was pregnant in another month we'll know for sure he said okay end the quote
POD1000000019_S0000352	ah i didn't skip over anything there at all she writes a sentence about waiting to move to nashville until she graduates high school then the very next sentence is about her finding out she's pregnant
POD1000000019_S0000353	there's a four year gap between those two sentences i still have no idea why that gap is there but that's when i knew i was reading some bullshit
POD1000000019_S0000354	so after finishing the book i went back to read this stuff in the beginning and i found that disclaimer about the facts being altered
POD1000000019_S0000355	and that disclaimer is written by jeannie's co-author who i also feel the mansion is a preacher here's what he writes quote to keep from hurting some of the folks jeannie loves we have changed the names of several people in the book
POD1000000019_S0000356	in one instinct we also changed the details slightly to purpose fully disguise a scene
POD1000000019_S0000357	only those who were involved will recognize what we have done but all the rest is true just as it happened when god picked up the harper valley girl and set her on a mountain top
POD1000000019_S0000358	okay even that disclaimer is so entirely bizarre the whole thing makes me wonder if this guy is even talking about inventing the character of phil blackman
POD1000000019_S0000359	first of all they changed the named to protect people jeannie loves jeannie loves the person who blackmailed her with revenge porn okay next in one instance we have changed the details slightly to disguise on scene
POD1000000019_S0000360	that is not at all and accurate description of full blackman existence in this book there are many scenes that had a lot more than slight details changed
POD1000000019_S0000361	several they had do been completely fabricated anywhere in the book she talks about the first black rose single is a lie talking about meeting aubrey mayhew in las vegas
POD1000000019_S0000362	is a lie talking about getting out of a contract with phil blackman to record with aubrey mayhew
POD1000000019_S0000363	is a lie it would take me ten minutes to list everything that is for sure a lie and it would probably take me an half an hour to list everything i suspect is a lie in this book
POD1000000019_S0000364	then still with this disclaimer the part of the end where he writes quote but all the rest is true and quote ah he wasn't there when all of this stuff happened so all by means is this is what she told me happened
POD1000000019_S0000365	and that really makes me wonder if jeannie came up with this whole phil blackman's story line on her own and tried to sell it to this guy as fact
POD1000000019_S0000366	maybe he figured out she was lying so this this disclaimer is his way of covering his own ass in case i don't know aubrey mayhew decided to sue the shit out of them
POD1000000019_S0000367	this is all obviously wild speculation on my part but at this point i'm not sure what other response i could possibly have did this pine of nonsense they attempt at disguising the truth is so clumsy that it even presents another possibility
POD1000000019_S0000368	which is that they wanted people to figure out the truth and have it blow up into this big controversy to sell the book that certainly sounds like a business strategy someone might pick up from say working with shelby singleton
POD1000000019_S0000369	the only problem being that hardly anyone read this stupid book in the first place so that didn't happen there's so much other stuff in that autobiography that i didn't even get into
POD1000000019_S0000370	definitely do buy this book if you want to see a worst case example of a country singer autobiography
POD1000000019_S0000371	i hadn't yet been broken down enough by making this podcast to just start writing in the books i read or else whoever ends up with my copy of this one could have looked forward to some pretty intense scribbles all over it i'm sure
POD1000000019_S0000372	oh yeah by the way i am giving away the books that i read to make season one of this podcast cocaine and rhinestones dot com slash give away for details on that you could end up with my copy of this book with a library card in the back and everything
POD1000000019_S0000373	a real piece of podcast history okay all of this deception aside i think we're starting to get an idea of how differently all the people involved can come out the other side of hits song
POD1000000019_S0000374	one thing that's really interesting that we heard today is unlike as you heard in the second episode of the podcast loretta's recording of the pill
POD1000000019_S0000375	the music establishment in nashville and everywhere else mostly just got on board with this song right away tex ritter did say that the song sounded dirty and suggestive and some radio stations did ban it but who cares
POD1000000019_S0000376	i let you hear it from industry giants you heard johnny cash say it won a grammy award you heard roger miller i announced it as the c m a single of the year
POD1000000019_S0000377	sure the lyrics aren't scandal is at all compared to the pill but why do you think these two songs were received so differently by the old guard i know what i think
POD1000000019_S0000378	i thinks money talks i think that by the time any of those would be buzz kills started paying attention this song was already the number one pop song in america and it went number one pop before it went number one country
POD1000000019_S0000379	every major record label in nashville had been falling all over itself for fifteen years trying to do that they have made jeannie c riley the mayor of nashville if she did it a second time
POD1000000019_S0000380	her second single didn't get there but they let her hang around a while to see if it happened again it didn't and there is the story we end up with
POD1000000019_S0000381	ah by the way i could also get into a whole other ramble about nature versus nurture here you know is jeannie c riley quote unquote the way that she is now
POD1000000019_S0000382	because of everything that happened to her or was she always like that i honestly don't know after recording this episode i was checking one more thing and i found a people magazine interview from nineteen eighty-one
POD1000000019_S0000383	that says jeannie was broken by the mid seventies so i was a little late on my guess when i said it looked like money problems were there in the early eighties but i was right
POD1000000019_S0000384	they were there if anyone care jeannie and mickey did remarry after a super long who gives a shit will they won't they phase in that same people magazine article i just mentioned he's quoted as saying
POD1000000019_S0000385	quote she's a little crazy but she's just a good old country girl really unquote also after recording this episode i found out that jeannie c riley misquoted the l a times critic robert hilbert in her book
POD1000000019_S0000386	because of course she did also the review was from nineteen sixty-nine so it makes so much more sense knowing that it came from that time
POD1000000019_S0000387	then two years later in nineteen seventy-one as jeannie stated in the book ah this is really aggravating for me to have to talk about right now because this is just my fault
POD1000000019_S0000388	this is my fault for not fact checking every minor detail of what i was using from a source that i knew was bad here's what robert actually wrote in his review
POD1000000019_S0000389	quote miss riley has all the confidence in the world on stage but unfortunately little of the talent
POD1000000019_S0000390	neither her voice nor most of her material largely drawn from her two albums is very good that is two strikes
POD1000000019_S0000391	the day the public forgets harper valley p t a may mean three unquote the difference between what is written there and what i quoted in the episode may seem so small as to not be noticeable by some of you but it's there and i do see it
POD1000000019_S0000392	my response in the episode to jeannie's version of this review is harsher than what it would been if i was reacting to the real review
POD1000000019_S0000393	so if robert hilbert happens to be listening to this i do apologize to you sir we may still disagree about something you wrote nearly forty years ago
POD1000000019_S0000394	but not nearly as strongly as i thought when reading and reacting to its second hand okay there are no more books to talk about as sources for this one
POD1000000019_S0000395	lots of good video clicks on cocaine and rhinestones dot com so make sure to go watch those to get the full picture of some things i talked about come back next week we're putting this baby to bed it's the end of the harper valley p t a series
POD1000000019_S0000396	we're talking tom t hall on cocaine and rhinestones
POD1000000021_S0000001	is it true that he is kind of a private and quiet like introverted person when he is by himself
POD1000000021_S0000002	are you asking me or him
POD1000000021_S0000004	asking him if you want to weigh in too that's fine
POD1000000021_S0000005	he definitely is
POD1000000021_S0000006	that's trina edwards we were talking about her husband edwin edwards the former governor of louisiana
POD1000000021_S0000007	trina is almost forty-two and edwin will be ninety-three in august
POD1000000021_S0000008	she was passing along my questions because he has a hard time hearing over the phone
POD1000000021_S0000009	is it true that you're a quiet kind of introverted person when you're not in public when you're home by yourself
POD1000000021_S0000010	well i'm a very different person when i'm not on the stage
POD1000000021_S0000011	this the way i am um um i'm very quiet and private and i don't drink at all
POD1000000021_S0000012	i don't use drugs at all and so now most fun i have in life is taking care of my seven-year-old child
POD1000000021_S0000013	and my wife
POD1000000021_S0000014	okay
POD1000000021_S0000015	trina is edwin's third wife
POD1000000021_S0000016	they've been married since two thousand and eleven
POD1000000021_S0000017	the two of them met when she started writing him letters and federal prison
POD1000000021_S0000018	edwards served eight years on corruption charges
POD1000000021_S0000019	he was convicted of rigging casino licenses during his final term as governor
POD1000000021_S0000020	when he got out he and trina brought their relationship to reality t v
POD1000000021_S0000022	their show went off the air after eight episodes
POD1000000021_S0000023	since then edwards has run for congress and lost and he's had a couple of health scares
POD1000000021_S0000024	but he still has a remarkable command of louisiana political history much of which he shaped during his four terms as governor
POD1000000021_S0000025	to understand david duke you need to understand what makes louisiana politics distinctive
POD1000000021_S0000026	the unique alliances the entrenched corruption and the charismatic figures who've molded the state and their own images
POD1000000021_S0000027	and edwin edwards is louisiana politics personified
POD1000000021_S0000028	edward's first gubernatorial campaign began in nineteen seventy-one
POD1000000021_S0000029	first of all i spoke french and then in nineteen seventy-one there were still people all the people in louisiana who understood english but they prefer to hear and speak in french
POD1000000021_S0000030	so ah maison french accent it helped me with that particular group of people
POD1000000021_S0000031	i mean he had a coalition a distinctly louisiana coalition he had cajuns and blacks
POD1000000021_S0000032	that's marc morial he worked with edwards as the state legislator and as the mayor of new orleans
POD1000000021_S0000033	in louisiana if you can put those two voting bases together in those days it was an unbeatable coalition
POD1000000021_S0000034	unlike most of his white democratic peers edwards was an unabashed civil rights champion
POD1000000021_S0000035	he invited black louisianans to work in government positions and helped to craft a state constitution that outlawed discrimination
POD1000000021_S0000036	he also made louisiana richer
POD1000000021_S0000037	as governor edwards helped change how crude oil got taxed
POD1000000021_S0000038	moving from a flat fee per barrel to a percentage of the barrel price when oil prices shut up state revenues soared
POD1000000021_S0000039	so did edwin edwards his popularity
POD1000000021_S0000040	story is about edwards's gambling and womanizing didn't hurt him with voters
POD1000000021_S0000041	the miasma of corruption and scandal that hung over his administration didn't damage him either
POD1000000021_S0000042	there were six grand jury investigations during edwards's first term
POD1000000021_S0000043	but he wasn't indicted in any of those cases
POD1000000021_S0000044	it seemed like the silver haired silver tongued governor could talk his way out of anything
POD1000000021_S0000045	when asked about some iffy political donations edwards said it was illegal for them to give but not for me to receive
POD1000000021_S0000046	edwards led louisiana for eight years leaving office in march nineteen eighty
POD1000000021_S0000047	the only thing stopping him from being governor for life for term limits that edwards himself had pushed for
POD1000000021_S0000048	so he went on a brief hiatus sitting out the next election cycle then returning in nineteen eighty-three to reclaim his throne
POD1000000021_S0000049	in the last days of that campaign edwards fired off his most famous one liner
POD1000000021_S0000050	the only way i could lose this election is if i got caught in bed with a dead girl or alive boy
POD1000000021_S0000051	and that took on a life of its own and has been quoted many times since by other people
POD1000000021_S0000052	is that good enough or
POD1000000021_S0000053	ah yeah thank you trina does he regret saying that or is he happy that he said it
POD1000000021_S0000055	i guarantee you he doesn't regret anything he's ever done hold on
POD1000000021_S0000056	do you regret saying that or are you happy you said that
POD1000000021_S0000057	no um i ah it's one of the things that i said that ah people identify with me and i thought it was kind of funny
POD1000000021_S0000058	edwards was right to believe that nineteen eighty-three election was a lock he'd win it with sixty-two percent of the vote
POD1000000021_S0000059	to celebrate his victory he did something audacious even by edwin edwards standards
POD1000000021_S0000061	if there's one thing louisiana governor elect edwin edwards knows it's how to have a good time even with a four million dollar campaign deficit staring him down
POD1000000021_S0000062	edwards chartered two jumbo jets announced he was going to paris and invited anyone willing to contribute ten thousand dollars to come on along
POD1000000021_S0000063	more than six hundred people joined edwards on that trip to france which was touted as the largest single political fundraiser ever thrown by an american politician
POD1000000021_S0000064	the writer roy blount junior on assignment for people magazine went along for the ride
POD1000000021_S0000065	you know the whole deal did not smell of righteousness
POD1000000021_S0000066	that's for sure but as some people said it's hard to be proper and have a real good time
POD1000000021_S0000067	the french speaking edwards and his crew of louisianans eight high class cuisine at the palace of versailles
POD1000000021_S0000068	the governor also received a warm greeting from a nun outside notre dame cathedral
POD1000000021_S0000069	and she gave him what she described as a french kiss which was actually of course more like a nun's kiss
POD1000000021_S0000070	but she could take a joke and so he said okay sister but just don't let me get into the habit
POD1000000021_S0000071	and all of his supporters gathered round cheered and beamed
POD1000000021_S0000072	and that's the kind of thing they had come to paris for
POD1000000021_S0000073	the party ended for edwin edwards as soon as those jumbo jets landed back in louisiana
POD1000000021_S0000074	the campaign of eighty-three was great it was one of the finest experiences of my life
POD1000000021_S0000075	the service in the governor's office from eighty-four to eighty-seven it was not
POD1000000021_S0000076	it was it was a a very difficult experience
POD1000000021_S0000077	that said moreland he was edwin edwards's assistant
POD1000000021_S0000078	by the mid nineteen eighties oil and gas revenues had plummeted and the state was facing a huge deficit
POD1000000021_S0000079	edwards tried to fill that hole with tax increases
POD1000000021_S0000080	his constituents didn't find that rakish or charming
POD1000000021_S0000081	you know when you're trying to raise taxes on people who are really struggling already it's a very precarious political situation to be in
POD1000000021_S0000082	so this tax package was probably the beginning of his unpopularity
POD1000000021_S0000083	in february nineteen eighty-five edwin edwards is run of bad luck
POD1000000021_S0000084	got a whole lot worse
POD1000000021_S0000085	the fifty count federal indictment charges governor edwards and six others including his brother and a nephew
POD1000000021_S0000086	with racketeering and fraud and a multimillion dollar scheme involving the effective sale of state approval for a medical facility construction projects
POD1000000021_S0000087	edwards was accused basically of accepting bribes to steer state money to his friends
POD1000000021_S0000088	the trial dragged on somehow for fourteen weeks
POD1000000021_S0000089	moreland spent most of it on a pay phone outside the new orleans courtroom
POD1000000021_S0000090	i was constantly calling the governor's office in baton rouge and getting the phone messages
POD1000000021_S0000091	and returning those phone calls and explaining to people under the circumstances you know the governor can't talk to you right this minute
POD1000000021_S0000092	and um we tried to be as diplomatic about it as we could
POD1000000021_S0000093	and of course most people knew where he was and what he was going through but they'd call anyway
POD1000000021_S0000094	the case ended in a mistrial edwards was later retried and found not guilty
POD1000000021_S0000095	when that verdict came in the prosecutor said if we didn't make him honest i hope we made him sorry
POD1000000021_S0000096	when i asked edwards about the case he didn't sound all that sorry
POD1000000021_S0000097	that was an example of a of ah of a stupid prosecutor ah who didn't know anything about what's happened
POD1000000021_S0000098	did it bother him when people said he was profiting from his role as the governor
POD1000000021_S0000099	did it bother you when people said you were profiting from your role as governor
POD1000000021_S0000100	no because
POD1000000021_S0000102	there's no truth to it so it didn't bother me at all i ah i i just laughed about it
POD1000000021_S0000103	edwards may have been laughing but he was still in a precarious spot
POD1000000021_S0000104	in good times most people in louisiana loved his misadventures
POD1000000021_S0000105	but these weren't good times the boom years of the nineteen-seventies were long gone
POD1000000021_S0000106	in nineteen eighty-seven louisiana was ready for a change
POD1000000021_S0000107	i notice my opponents don't make many people angry
POD1000000021_S0000108	that doesn't surprise you does it politics as usual
POD1000000021_S0000109	i don't like louisiana politics i love louisiana
POD1000000021_S0000110	i love louisiana enough to make some people angry
POD1000000021_S0000111	buddy roemer was a congressman from north louisiana
POD1000000021_S0000112	in the last four weeks of the nineteen eighty-seven governor's race he zoomed from fifth to first in the polls buoyed by folksy t v ads and a string of newspaper endorsements
POD1000000021_S0000113	roemer led edwards by five percentage points after the first round of voting
POD1000000021_S0000114	setting the stage for a runoff but when edwards emerged after one a m to greet his supporters he made a move that nobody had anticipated
POD1000000021_S0000115	and i have determined that under the circumstances since i did not run first
POD1000000021_S0000116	that it would be inappropriate for me to continue this election
POD1000000021_S0000117	supporters were stunned some of this family cried
POD1000000021_S0000119	he's sixty he's been governor twelve years
POD1000000021_S0000120	he said that's long enough most voters thought so too
POD1000000021_S0000121	there would be no runoff romer would be the next governor of louisiana
POD1000000021_S0000122	and edwin edwards he looked to outside observers like his career was finished
POD1000000021_S0000123	but that's not how edwards saw it dropping out of the race that was the first step in his comeback plan
POD1000000021_S0000124	i spoke with him that night and he he was absolutely resolute that oh look you know i'm gonna let him have it
POD1000000021_S0000125	i'm gonna turn it over time he's been going all over this state saying he's gonna fix this he's gonna fix that
POD1000000021_S0000126	and he's gonna disintegrate you mark my word
POD1000000021_S0000128	edwards had it all mapped out he would let roemer run the state for a few difficult years then reemerge to save the day
POD1000000021_S0000129	it wouldn't be that simple the nineteen ninety-one election would be about a lot more than who got to sleep in the governor's mansion
POD1000000021_S0000130	it would be a fight over what louisiana was and what it should be
POD1000000021_S0000131	and edwin edwards and buddy roemer wouldn't be the only ones in that battle

POD1000000021_S0000152	when edwin edwards was three years old the governor of louisiana had a man kidnapped
POD1000000021_S0000153	it was nineteen thirty and the governor was huey long
POD1000000021_S0000154	the guy who got snatched was about to expose rampant graft in state government
POD1000000021_S0000155	four days after he disappeared the victim reemerged to say not at all credibly that he staged the kidnapping himself
POD1000000021_S0000156	in a radio broadcast the man announced that governor huey long was his best friend in the world
POD1000000021_S0000157	long was shot and killed at the state capital five years later
POD1000000021_S0000158	a lot of people in louisiana will tell you that he was the best friend the state ever had
POD1000000021_S0000159	yes long was a corrupt dictator and sure he orchestrated a kidnapping
POD1000000021_S0000160	but he also built bridges and hospitals and paid for it all with money he pried free from the big oil companies
POD1000000021_S0000161	edwin edwards carried on huey long tradition of economic populism
POD1000000021_S0000162	like long edwards use money snatched from big oil to build bridges and hospitals
POD1000000021_S0000163	all that and he finished construction of the louisiana superdome
POD1000000021_S0000164	david duke on the other hand said he wouldn't follow long's example
POD1000000021_S0000165	we need another populist not a populist like heuy long for more government but a populist for the state of louisiana for less government and more power to the people thank you very much
POD1000000021_S0000167	in reality duke's brand of populism had nothing to do with shrinking government
POD1000000021_S0000168	it was built on racial resentment
POD1000000021_S0000169	duke's message the journalist john mcginnis wrote held a lot of appeal for the children and grandchildren of huey long's old voters
POD1000000021_S0000170	i doubt the duke cared one way or the other about long's policies but he did respect the man's power and fame and reference it to make a point about his own celebrity
POD1000000021_S0000171	the ladies that do the tours the state capital not far from here they always tell me they say you know there's two things people want to see when they come the state capitol in baton rouge
POD1000000021_S0000172	they want to see where huey long was shot and where david duke says
POD1000000021_S0000174	buddy roemer offered voters a third option a complete break from the sleaze and self-dealing that had marred louisiana politics from the long era to the present day
POD1000000021_S0000175	the harvard educated roemer said that long's legacy was something for nothing
POD1000000021_S0000176	somebody else pays
POD1000000021_S0000177	roemer promised a new era of responsibility one that would earn his home state national respect
POD1000000021_S0000178	he called this the roemer revolution
POD1000000021_S0000179	most people in america will never come to louisiana most people in america will know us only by our reputation
POD1000000021_S0000180	i'll put louisiana first and we'll make them stop laughing and start listening
POD1000000021_S0000181	roemer's big initiative was a plan to modernize the state's approach to taxation
POD1000000021_S0000182	one day early and with votes to spare tax reform finally made it through the louisiana legislature
POD1000000021_S0000183	we're talking a new way of approaching our old problems that are eating us alive
POD1000000021_S0000184	romer was adamant that his fiscal reform plan was not a tax increase
POD1000000021_S0000185	he said it would just shift more of the burden to people with higher incomes
POD1000000021_S0000186	in the spring of nineteen eighty-nine he made that pitch to louisiana's voters who needed to approve the proposal in a statewide referendum
POD1000000021_S0000187	david duke then a newly elected state legislator was one of the governor's most outspoken critics
POD1000000021_S0000188	overall it's a six hundred and twenty-five million dollar tax increase and this from a governor who swore to us he would not raise taxes
POD1000000021_S0000189	i i i'm gonna ignore david duke
POD1000000021_S0000190	i mean i don't care what the american nazi party thinks about this program
POD1000000021_S0000191	a lot of people in louisiana did care what david duke had to say
POD1000000021_S0000192	duke staged a series of rallies across the state railing against roemer and presenting himself as the champion of the working class
POD1000000021_S0000193	at one event a louisiana anti-tax tea party he climbed aboard a riverboat and tossed some tea into the mississippi river
POD1000000021_S0000194	you don't raise taxes in a recession duke said
POD1000000021_S0000195	you don't tax your way into prosperity
POD1000000021_S0000196	the blues on the streets of new orleans are now being sung in the governor's mansion after voters resoundingly rejected new taxes
POD1000000021_S0000197	digging louisiana's already troubled economy ever deeper in debt and forcing reform minded governor buddy roemer to scramble his way out of a new financial crisis
POD1000000021_S0000198	as of may nineteen eighty-nine the roma revolution was pretty much dead
POD1000000021_S0000199	later that year roemer's wife patty left him when the political consultant raymond strother visited romer in early nineteen nighty-one
POD1000000021_S0000200	the governor was still in a deep funk
POD1000000021_S0000201	he said i'm glad to see you i need your help
POD1000000021_S0000202	he said i need to write a letter to patty
POD1000000021_S0000203	i know i've made some mistakes but he said i want her to come home he said help me write this letter you're a good writer
POD1000000021_S0000204	strother said that he wasn't the man for that job
POD1000000021_S0000205	his own wife had just left him a few weeks earlier
POD1000000021_S0000206	but strother who'd helped romer win in nineteen eighty-seven was available to work on the governor's re-election campaign
POD1000000021_S0000208	he said move move into the mansion and i did
POD1000000021_S0000209	and it was nice you know you have a dry cleaners downstairs and you put your shoes outside the door every night and they come to start the next day shined
POD1000000021_S0000210	and every night when i go to my room there'll be a pitcher of milk and ice and some still warm cookies
POD1000000021_S0000211	how good were the cookies
POD1000000021_S0000212	the cookies were splendid ah
POD1000000021_S0000213	they were baked every afternoon and sometimes again just before breakfast
POD1000000021_S0000214	so i always had fresh cookies that probably gained ten pounds i was already fat so
POD1000000021_S0000215	apart from the cookies strother has no fond memories of working on rohmer's re-election
POD1000000021_S0000216	the first big conflict came when a new agey rumor advisor named danny walker suggested that the governor wear a rubber band around his wrist
POD1000000021_S0000217	and he said well every time you have a bad thought if you pop that rubber band and cause a little pain pretty soon you won't be having bad thoughts
POD1000000021_S0000218	i said you keep your damn rubber bands yourself danny
POD1000000021_S0000219	roemer actually liked the rubber band idea
POD1000000021_S0000220	the governor also embraced robert fulcrums book
POD1000000021_S0000221	all i really need to know i learned in kindergarten which touted the virtues of sharing everything and playing fair
POD1000000021_S0000222	but he was into that guru sort of stuff touchy feely
POD1000000021_S0000223	i can't stand that kind of thing
POD1000000021_S0000224	after reading that self-help guide the governor decided he'd been too abrasive
POD1000000021_S0000225	in his state of the state address romer apologized to the legislature for his inflexibility and insensitivity
POD1000000021_S0000226	let's say good bye to me and hello to we
POD1000000021_S0000227	let's say good bye to lines in the same
POD1000000021_S0000228	for strother the self-help stuff was bad but what happened next was worse
POD1000000021_S0000230	one day at the mansion he happened upon a meeting that he wasn't supposed to know about
POD1000000021_S0000231	i saw mary madelin a whole bunch of high echelon republicans sitting around a table with bud by the dining room table with buddy
POD1000000021_S0000232	and i said oh my god
POD1000000021_S0000233	romer had always been conservative
POD1000000021_S0000234	as a congressman he tended to vote with republican president ronald reagan and against his own democratic party
POD1000000021_S0000235	but strothers says romer had always assured him he wouldn't move to the g o p
POD1000000021_S0000236	he broke that promise in march nineteen ninety-one
POD1000000021_S0000237	romer explained himself at a press conference outside the white house where president george h w bush had just welcomed him into the republican fold
POD1000000021_S0000238	i would say the party is not the most important thing in american families are integrity ideals commitment principles
POD1000000021_S0000239	those are more important and on those issues i never change
POD1000000021_S0000240	but when it comes to political action i will be a republican and proudly walk in the park
POD1000000021_S0000241	romer was the first sitting governor in modern american history to switch parties
POD1000000021_S0000242	ideology aside romer thought the move was smart strategy
POD1000000021_S0000243	edwin edwards was going to grab votes from his left no matter what
POD1000000021_S0000244	romer figured that branding himself a republican would help stave off right wing challengers who might threaten his re-election
POD1000000021_S0000245	the statewide polls showed that the top three candidates are duke edwards and myself
POD1000000021_S0000246	and the last poll i was in the forties edwards in the thirties
POD1000000021_S0000247	and duke ten eleven or twelve with some undecided i felt good about the politics
POD1000000021_S0000248	raymond strother did not feel good about the politics
POD1000000021_S0000249	it was a dumb move for him and me it was just a dumb move
POD1000000021_S0000250	democrats in louisiana felt burned by romer and republicans including state party officials weren't sure they could trust him either
POD1000000021_S0000251	billy nungesser the republican chair who'd undercut the effort to censure david duke
POD1000000021_S0000252	resented that romer hadn't included him in discussions about the party switch and romer forgetting the lessons of all i ever needed to know i learned in kindergarten cursed out nungesser rather than trying to appease him
POD1000000021_S0000253	the louisiana republicans made their endorsement in the governor's race at a state convention in june nineteen ninety-one
POD1000000021_S0000254	that endorsement wouldn't go to buddy roemer or david duke
POD1000000021_S0000255	the g o p's choice was a pro-life congressman named clyde holloway the preferred candidate of the christian coalition
POD1000000021_S0000256	romer knowing that he wouldn't get endorsed didn't bother to show up at the convention
POD1000000021_S0000257	but duke and his supporters made their presence known
POD1000000021_S0000258	here's how the anti-duke activist beth rickey described the scene in nineteen ninety-one
POD1000000021_S0000259	it was like a duke convention they were just booing indiscriminately anything and everybody and they were just wild and they were
POD1000000021_S0000260	then duke was egging them on you know to disrupt things
POD1000000021_S0000261	they had to sing dixie to quiet them down quite literally they tried god bless america
POD1000000021_S0000262	ah and ah the battle hymn of the republic but it wasn't until i say saying i wish i were in the land of cotton that the ah hush fell over the convention
POD1000000021_S0000263	buddy roemer had tried to consolidate the conservative vote
POD1000000021_S0000264	that plan had been a total failure
POD1000000021_S0000265	the splintering of the louisiana republican party would be a gift to edwin edwards and to david duke

POD1000000021_S0000284	no other state does elections like louisiana
POD1000000021_S0000285	the credit for that or the blame belongs to edwin edwards
POD1000000021_S0000286	the first time he ran for governor edwards had to compete in three separate races
POD1000000021_S0000287	a close democratic primary a democratic runoff and then the general election
POD1000000021_S0000288	in the days when democrats dominated louisiana that last race against the republican also ran was a pointless nuisance
POD1000000021_S0000289	it was like winning the hundred meter dash at the olympics then having to outspread a kid pulled from the stands to get your gold medal
POD1000000021_S0000290	and i i didn't like that idea i said well look let's change it
POD1000000021_S0000291	everybody qualifies at the same time regardless of party ah affiliation
POD1000000021_S0000292	and everybody votes for anybody he or she wishes regardless of registration
POD1000000021_S0000293	louisiana's open primary system went into effect in nineteen seventy-five
POD1000000021_S0000294	edwards cruised to re-election that year as the republican party didn't even field a candidate
POD1000000021_S0000295	but in the reagan years the g o p surged throughout the south
POD1000000021_S0000296	by nineteen ninety-one the open primary was open in a way edwards maybe hadn't anticipated
POD1000000021_S0000297	it was a true two party free for all
POD1000000021_S0000298	political writer john mcginnis had a name for the showdown between david duke edwin edwards and buddy roemer
POD1000000021_S0000299	i call this the the race from hell
POD1000000021_S0000300	you have ah three very angry men ah candidates for governor and the people aren't too happy either
POD1000000021_S0000301	in the beginning the race from hell wasn't exactly rollicking
POD1000000021_S0000302	one reason for that was a package of campaign finance reforms part of buddy roemer's good government agenda
POD1000000021_S0000303	the new law limited individual contributions to five thousand dollars and major statewide races
POD1000000021_S0000304	banned cash contributions of more than a hundred dollars and required that small cash donations be reported
POD1000000021_S0000305	duke could pass the bucket with impunity during his nineteen ninety senate campaign because that was a federal race
POD1000000021_S0000306	but thanks to roemer the revolutionary louisiana's guidelines on cash giving were now stricter than the nation's
POD1000000021_S0000307	hamstrung by these new rules duke held fewer rallies as a candidate for governor than when he ran for the senate and edwards's fundraising slowed to a trickle
POD1000000021_S0000308	he'd raised sixteen million dollars during the nineteen eighty-three governor's race
POD1000000021_S0000309	in the nineteen ninety-one primary he brought in a little more than one million dollars
POD1000000021_S0000310	and buddy roemer he preferred staying in to going out to meet his public
POD1000000021_S0000311	romer had always been like this
POD1000000021_S0000312	raymond strother saw it up close during the nineteen eighty-seven race
POD1000000021_S0000313	he was sitting back to campaign headquarters and read novels usually mystery novels and he wouldn't go out and campaign
POD1000000021_S0000314	we'd go to a restaurant to eat lunch and he would sit in the back the restaurant in the corner with his back to the room
POD1000000021_S0000315	so nobody would see him and recognize him and come over and start talking
POD1000000021_S0000316	romer's charismatic misanthrope routine had worked out fine in nineteen eighty-seven
POD1000000021_S0000317	and it seemed possible he could pull off the same trick in nineteen ninety-one
POD1000000021_S0000318	michelle showers started volunteering for the romer campaign when she was still in college at louisiana tech then got a job on staff right after graduation
POD1000000021_S0000319	she says when the governor did make public appearances early on he seemed totally energized
POD1000000021_S0000320	and he literally walked into the room you know pushing both doors open
POD1000000021_S0000321	good afternoon everybody great to see you
POD1000000021_S0000322	you know he was clapping and smiling and really exuberant
POD1000000021_S0000323	and it was really very exciting to be in a room with him
POD1000000021_S0000324	he was just really engaging the crowd
POD1000000021_S0000325	and i would say for the first part of the campaign that's the way he was he really came into room and made it alive
POD1000000021_S0000326	the problem for romer was that a lot of swing voters felt drawn to another candidate
POD1000000021_S0000327	at first strother liked the focus group results he was hearing
POD1000000021_S0000328	blue collar democrats said they couldn't stand a hypothetical candidate with all of david duke's characteristics
POD1000000021_S0000329	but then as soon as i learned it was david duke they'd say well that's what politicians do or
POD1000000021_S0000330	well you know if ah k k k
POD1000000021_S0000331	well he was a young man and a nazi well he was a young guy
POD1000000021_S0000332	college kids do stupid stuff you know whatever it was they'd make an excuse for him
POD1000000021_S0000333	while romer struggled to hold his coalition together duke was finding a new way to expand his appeal
POD1000000021_S0000334	it's been tough for me sometimes over last couple of years a lot of media attacks but was made us made it better for me is that i'm a christian
POD1000000021_S0000335	i work hard i believe in christ and i'm gonna keep on fighting for you and for the future louisiana
POD1000000021_S0000336	thank you very much
POD1000000021_S0000338	duke invoked his christianity far more in the governor's race than in any of his previous campaigns
POD1000000021_S0000339	he used religion as both a shield and a sword
POD1000000021_S0000340	at a debate in september duke said that he'd repented for his past sins and those who tried to discredit him were being unchristian
POD1000000021_S0000341	i've certainly been intolerant before my life
POD1000000021_S0000342	but those who condemn and point their fingers at me i'd like them to look in their own lives and ask if they'd never hurt a friend or change their opinions
POD1000000021_S0000343	it wasn't clear based on polling how white people in louisiana were responding to duke's latest attempt at image management
POD1000000021_S0000344	susan howell had been struggling for years to get a handle on duke's voters
POD1000000021_S0000345	howell was a professor of political science at the university of new orleans
POD1000000021_S0000346	she'd taken her first look at duke during his run for the state house when his opponent john treene hired her to do a phone survey
POD1000000021_S0000347	howell's poll in the primary had duke at seven percent she was off by twenty-six points
POD1000000021_S0000348	and i was stunned and then um john treene stood up on a table and he was stunned too and
POD1000000021_S0000349	i remember him saying the people of metairie are not racist
POD1000000021_S0000350	and i thought well maybe we should re-think that
POD1000000021_S0000351	treene fired howell after the primary so she'd have to wait to pull another due grace
POD1000000021_S0000352	but she had a pretty good idea of what was going on with his supporters
POD1000000021_S0000353	people were reluctant to say i'm gonna vote for duke because they were afraid of being labeled racist even though they're talking to it you know um on an anonymous phone call to a pollster
POD1000000021_S0000354	it's like people are reluctant to say how much alcohol they drank or were they ever arrested
POD1000000021_S0000355	this became a research challenge for howell and her graduate students how could they get david duke silent army to break its silence
POD1000000021_S0000356	we came up with some alternate i would call sneakier indirect questions to identify someone who might be sympathetic to duke
POD1000000021_S0000357	um one of them which actually worked pretty well in increasing the duke support in the poll was to ask people if they approve or disapprove of the martin luther king holiday
POD1000000021_S0000358	howell conducted a survey one month before the gubernatorial primary
POD1000000021_S0000359	respondents were asked who they were voting for and also how they felt about statements like if blacks would only try harder they could be just as well off as whites
POD1000000021_S0000360	the raw numbers showed that thirty-five percent of people were voting for buddy roemer thirty percent for edwin edwards and twelve percent for david duke
POD1000000021_S0000361	but when howell accounted for her sneekier indirect questions support for roemer and edwards dipped and duke's support doubled
POD1000000021_S0000362	given the margin of error the election was too close to call
POD1000000021_S0000364	that's how things look from the outside on the inside there was gossip about a possible secret alliance in the governor's race
POD1000000021_S0000365	romer's political consultant raymond strother heard that speculation
POD1000000021_S0000366	the rumor that we heard was that edwin edwards was encouraging and perhaps funding david duke
POD1000000021_S0000368	edwards wanted revenge on buddy roemer after losing to him in nineteen eighty-seven but edwards also knew how to play the odds
POD1000000021_S0000369	he was smart enough the theory went to sense that he'd have a better shot against an ex klansman than against the incumbent governor
POD1000000021_S0000370	ah nobody had any proof whatsoever
POD1000000021_S0000371	but i seldom ran in anybody on either side who didn't think that edwards was playing funny with david duke
POD1000000021_S0000373	when i got edwards on the phone
POD1000000021_S0000374	i asked if there was any truth to all that chatter
POD1000000021_S0000376	did he or his supporters do anything to help duke make the runoff
POD1000000021_S0000377	like either giving him money or or propping him up in some way
POD1000000021_S0000378	did you or your supporters do anything to help duke get into the run off with you
POD1000000021_S0000379	no i didn't i i didn't do that because i didn't think it was necessary and i would've maybe got caught and so i didn't do that
POD1000000021_S0000380	i just let it run his race i ran mine romo ran his
POD1000000021_S0000382	and that's as far as i got chasing down that rumor
POD1000000021_S0000383	but i did learn something else
POD1000000021_S0000384	the edwards campaign it turns out had a totally different secret alliance
POD1000000021_S0000386	clyde holloway was the pro-life congressman who'd gotten the official endorsement of the louisiana republican party
POD1000000021_S0000387	instead of duker roemer he was way back in the polls in a distant fourth and needed cash to air commercials
POD1000000021_S0000388	one of edwin edwards his closest friends
POD1000000021_S0000390	new one of holloway's campaign advisers
POD1000000021_S0000391	to him acord says the two of them hatched a plan
POD1000000021_S0000392	he would ah show me results of a tracking poll which how people confirm that every vote declined
POD1000000021_S0000393	holloway was receiving or getting was coming directly off the sitting governor buddy roemer
POD1000000021_S0000394	and we would have people that were maxed out or have a lot of money to support
POD1000000021_S0000395	and when edwards asked what else they could do so we get these commercials on t v or radio
POD1000000021_S0000396	i said that would help us possibly get in the second primary would david duke rather than a sitting governor
POD1000000021_S0000397	to him acord is describing an electoral double bank shot
POD1000000021_S0000398	edwards supporters send money to holloway
POD1000000021_S0000399	holloway takes votes from roemer
POD1000000021_S0000400	roemer slides out of the runoff and duke slides in
POD1000000021_S0000401	we felt that we could be um david duke um substantially and um motorola would be a different results
POD1000000021_S0000403	ah polling at the time so it would've been tied
POD1000000021_S0000404	did governor edwards know about this strategy
POD1000000021_S0000405	yes i i informed him that was this that ah was going on and his answer was be careful
POD1000000021_S0000407	when i asked edwards about the alliance he told me he didn't know anything about it
POD1000000021_S0000408	in john mcginniss's book about the nineteen ninety-one campaign clyde holloway's campaign advisor brian wagner also denied making any such deal
POD1000000021_S0000409	wagner died in two thousand eighteen
POD1000000021_S0000410	that's sad i believed him acord's story
POD1000000021_S0000411	to be clear none of this would have been illegal assuming the campaign contributions got reported
POD1000000021_S0000412	but it was kind of devious a way to help david duke without giving him direct support
POD1000000021_S0000413	i don't want to make this alliance seem more important than it was
POD1000000021_S0000414	those hollaway adds were just a small drop in an enormous bucket of campaign spending
POD1000000021_S0000415	in the final days of the race the owner of a hazardous waste recycling company spent a massive amount of money on anti romer commercials cause he was angry about the governor's environmental regulations
POD1000000021_S0000416	that add-by was a huge deal
POD1000000021_S0000417	the hollaway adds really weren't
POD1000000021_S0000418	but it's still telling that the edwards campaign was willing to take active measures to help duke get into the runoff
POD1000000021_S0000419	i think it is very typical of edwin edwards
POD1000000021_S0000420	that's quin hillyer he was one of louisiana's most prominent anti-duke republicans
POD1000000021_S0000421	he also thinks edwards is totally corrupt
POD1000000021_S0000422	here's what he had to say about the edwards hollaway alliance
POD1000000021_S0000423	i'm not saying it's immoral it's just amoral completely without regard to the morality of trying to help david duke get into the runoff and whether or not that would be good or bad for the state of louisiana
POD1000000021_S0000424	it certainly was playing every political angle and it was edwin edwards and his people at their edwin edwards just
POD1000000021_S0000426	this was in some ways typical louisiana chicanery
POD1000000021_S0000427	politics is sport with a win at all costs mentality
POD1000000021_S0000428	but duke wasn't a typical candidate
POD1000000021_S0000429	maybe the edwards camp was right that their odds were better against duke than roemer
POD1000000021_S0000430	but what if they were wrong what if david duke won
POD1000000021_S0000432	we'll be back in a minute
POD1000000021_S0000434	i want to tell you about another podcast i think you'll love deep cover the drug wars
POD1000000021_S0000435	it's a true story that begins with a detroit f b i agent going undercover in an outlaw motorcycle gang
POD1000000021_S0000436	and ends with a u s invasion of a foreign country
POD1000000021_S0000437	pulitzer prize-wining journalist jake halpern guides listeners on this wild journey of marijuana motorcycles and men

POD1000000021_S0000439	you can hear it now on apple podcast or wherever you listen brought to you by pushikin industries
POD1000000021_S0000441	in january nineteen eighty-nine david duke had been a bit player a second tier candidate in a small suburban race
POD1000000021_S0000442	now almost three years later he was a star and a contender
POD1000000021_S0000443	his election night party was a celebration of how far he'd come and how close he was to winning the state's biggest prize
POD1000000021_S0000444	oh you wanna know i got those daggers over my shirt
POD1000000021_S0000445	no big deal i have those daggers on my face if i didn't have to see
POD1000000021_S0000446	on october nineteenth nineteen ninety-one duke's fans gathered at the pontchartrain center in his home territory of jefferson parish
POD1000000021_S0000447	they were treated to a short performance by that blonde woman in the blue dress who sang at lots of duke's rallies
POD1000000021_S0000449	after dixy came a prayer
POD1000000021_S0000450	we ask that you guide our leaders and that they might govern with compassion and love and understanding
POD1000000021_S0000451	we ask a special blessing up on this assembly
POD1000000021_S0000452	and that which is done here will be ultimately to the glory of the kingdom of god
POD1000000021_S0000453	and then david duke himself took the stage
POD1000000021_S0000454	with every minute ladies and gentlemen it appears that we will be in a runoff for the governorship of louisiana in new orlean
POD1000000021_S0000456	back in nineteen eighty-nine at duke's first victory party he'd shouted about winning a state house seat without any big political endorsements
POD1000000021_S0000457	he'd also complained about the media and the political establishment and whined that he was always getting lied about
POD1000000021_S0000458	in nineteen ninety-one he didn't sound bitter or vengeful
POD1000000021_S0000459	this david duke was smooth humble conciliatory
POD1000000021_S0000460	he figured out how he was supposed to sound and how to make an appeal that wasn't entirely based on grievance
POD1000000021_S0000461	my thanks goes first to the forest in my life that's giving me strength then help me
POD1000000021_S0000463	withstand a lot and continue to stand up for you
POD1000000021_S0000464	and that's jesus christ ladies and gentlemen i support
POD1000000021_S0000467	david duke was in the runoff with thirty-two percent of the vote
POD1000000021_S0000468	duke finished just two points behind the leader
POD1000000021_S0000469	edwin edwards buddy romer's political consultant raymond strother knew his man was gonna come in third
POD1000000021_S0000470	he went to bed at the governor's mansion before the race got called
POD1000000021_S0000471	and the next morning i got up i went down to get my cookies and milk
POD1000000021_S0000472	and buddy was down there and he said well you didn't have a good candidate did you
POD1000000021_S0000473	i said must not have buddy
POD1000000021_S0000474	he said well we took our best shot and he walked out that's last time i've ever spoken to him
POD1000000021_S0000475	buddy roemer finished five points behind david duke
POD1000000021_S0000476	ultimately he wasn't taken down by an electoral conspiracy
POD1000000021_S0000477	he'd lost because louisiana didn't want a reformer
POD1000000021_S0000478	and tonight the people spoke and they said buddy thanks but she didn't do enough and i think that's fair
POD1000000021_S0000479	when michelle schauer started working on the campaign she'd been inspired by buddy roemer's energy
POD1000000021_S0000480	but now that it was over schauer thought roemer actually seemed relieved
POD1000000021_S0000481	she found her own feelings harder to pin down
POD1000000021_S0000482	she was thinking about leaving the state maybe going to live with her parents in montana
POD1000000021_S0000483	but then she got approached by some people she knew from the louisiana republican party
POD1000000021_S0000484	they said we have an offer for you before you reject it outright
POD1000000021_S0000485	just listen to us and they said you could go to work on david duke's campaign
POD1000000021_S0000486	and of course my eyes widen like are you crazy
POD1000000021_S0000487	schauer had never considered supporting david duke much less working for him
POD1000000021_S0000488	her family had been on government aid when she was growing up so his rants against welfare weren't persuasive
POD1000000021_S0000489	but schauer really didn't want edwin edwards back in charge of louisiana
POD1000000021_S0000490	plus those people from the state party told her that she didn't need to take a public facing role
POD1000000021_S0000491	that she could stay in the shadows
POD1000000021_S0000492	schauer agreed to meet with duke's campaign manager howie farrell
POD1000000021_S0000493	when they got together he said that the time had come to broaden the duke operation by bringing in people from the establishment
POD1000000021_S0000494	schauer wanted to be a campaign manager someday
POD1000000021_S0000495	and she liked the idea of learning from one she was also unemployed
POD1000000021_S0000496	so from my perspective i had a job and an opportunity to look at an alternate campaign and that's how i started
POD1000000021_S0000498	during her stint as a duke staffer michelle schauer would hear things that shocked her
POD1000000021_S0000499	she'd also make a lot of phone calls on behalf of david duke using a list she brought with her from the roemer campaign
POD1000000021_S0000500	that list was the main reason the duke campaign had hired schauer
POD1000000021_S0000501	roemer supporters were now up for grabs if they voted republican in the november runoff
POD1000000021_S0000502	then david duke was going to be the governor of louisiana
POD1000000021_S0000503	the state republican party was still not going to support duke publicly but he was the last republican standing
POD1000000021_S0000504	and when schauer talked to her friends in the party they said they knew how to keep duke under control
POD1000000021_S0000505	when i would have those discussions they would say you know there's not much he can do
POD1000000021_S0000506	he's gonna have so many eyes on him if he wins
POD1000000021_S0000507	there's so many eyes we're gonna have people around him
POD1000000021_S0000508	he won't be able to push forward any of these ah agendas from his past
POD1000000021_S0000509	he'll have to stick to the policies
POD1000000021_S0000510	um and at that time i believed them
POD1000000021_S0000511	and at that time i thought well i wasn't really willing to say i was for him i was more for sweeping and a republican governor to try to fix things in louisiana
POD1000000021_S0000512	that's really where i was coming from at that time
POD1000000021_S0000514	next time on the final episode of our season four weeks to decide the fate of louisiana what would david duke do to win

POD1000000021_S0000531	thanks for listening
POD1000000023_S0000000	hello everyone i'm stephen west this is philosophize this thank you to everyone that continues to support the show on patreon and a special thank you to those you the up your pledge during these uncertain times
POD1000000023_S0000001	i'm beyond grateful and i'm not gonna take up anymore your time today's episode is on the political philosophy of richard rorty i hope you love the show today
POD1000000023_S0000003	so if you were having a political discussion with someone and the conversation took a turn and all sudden you guys are talking about human rights
POD1000000023_S0000004	there's certainly a lot of different angles you could approach that discussion from but one of the most common ones might be what philosophical grounding can we give to something like human rights
POD1000000023_S0000005	i mean we all think human beings have rights but where exactly do those rights come from who or what out there guarantees these rights for people
POD1000000023_S0000006	well a common answer to this question might be that human rights are inherited by birthright simply by virtue of being born every human being is entitled to certain natural rights or inalienable rights
POD1000000023_S0000007	rights that protect the dignity of a human life at such a basic level that to go against them starts to seem like you'd be going against nature
POD1000000023_S0000008	now as far as the philosophical grounding is concerned this is an attitude much more common during the beginning of the enlightenment than it is today
POD1000000023_S0000009	and the two main thinkers that took on this position are often cited to be john locke and immanuel kant
POD1000000023_S0000010	when it comes to answering the question of who or what guarantees these human rights john locke goes in the direction of god you know we are endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights
POD1000000023_S0000011	and kant goes more in the direction of a priori fact derived from reason but either way these thinkers are in their own way trying to use reason to arrive at a universal that guarantees human beings are born with natural rights
POD1000000023_S0000012	little did either of these thinkers know that just a hundred and forty years later we would be immersed in two world wars that would make the argument for the natural rights of human beings seem about as important as neck ruffles were to them
POD1000000023_S0000013	see as we've talked about on this show the early twentieth century was full of thinkers dissatisfied with what the enlightenment had produced they even went so far as to say that the entire project of the enlightenment was destined to consume itself from the start
POD1000000023_S0000014	yeah sure at the beginning reason calls into question much of the religious dogma of the middle ages but what inevitably has to happen once it gets done with that job is reason has to start questioning the new foundations for things
POD1000000023_S0000015	reason has to start questioning itself which then leads to philosophers using the process of rationality to find out that rationality is not some unbiased a historical measuring tool
POD1000000023_S0000016	it's not some neutral point from which we can make unambiguous claims about the truth of human rights or more importantly the universe to the thinker we're gonna be talking about today richard rorty
POD1000000023_S0000017	people like locke and kant were no more discovering a truth about what grounds human rights than hammurabi was before them
POD1000000023_S0000018	but unlike many of the thinkers of the early twenties century who may have felt a bit disenfranchised by the rational process richard rorty felt optimistic about rationality
POD1000000023_S0000019	some people called rorty a postmodernist which would usually place him in staunch opposition to anything that even sounds like the word enlightenment
POD1000000023_S0000020	like excitement but let me tell you rorty was a very exciting man he rejected the title of postmodernist and most titles for that matter
POD1000000023_S0000021	he operated in a very unique realm for a thinker where like a typical post-structuralist he didn't believe in any sort of grand narrative that could explain away the universe
POD1000000023_S0000022	but yet he was still a die hard card carrying fan of the project of the enlightenment overall
POD1000000023_S0000023	see in a world where there are so many twentieth century thinkers hating on the enlightenment here is a guy some people viewed as a post-structuralist coming to its defense
POD1000000023_S0000024	let me explain why he even do something like this
POD1000000023_S0000025	when immanuel kant in his famous essay describes the enlightenment as man's removal of his self-incurred tutelage yeah he's talking about the tutelage of the religious dogma of the past
POD1000000023_S0000026	but rorty would extend that tutelage to the rational dogma that was to come in the future because of how over-ambitious we were at the beginning of the enlightenment about what rationality could produce
POD1000000023_S0000027	the spirit of the enlightenment to rorty was not to use reason to arrive at the truth about the universe
POD1000000023_S0000028	it was ultimately a call to subvert traditional forms of authority the significance of the enlightenment was not to land on new answers
POD1000000023_S0000029	it was to question old assumptions so in that sense yeah the initial project of the enlightenment ultimately consumed itself
POD1000000023_S0000030	but to richard rorty the initial project of the enlightenment was meant to consume itself thinkers like isaiah berlin that would come along and suggest a pluralistic vision of things
POD1000000023_S0000031	this wasn't an anti-enlightenment idea at all to rorty this was the project of the enlightenment left to play itself out
POD1000000023_S0000032	thinkers like berlin were always going to eventually come along
POD1000000023_S0000033	see the project of the enlightenment maturing through people like isaiah berlin taught us a couple of extremely valuable insights
POD1000000023_S0000034	one of which was that we don't need to try to use reason to appeal to some ultimate authority or universal to ground our ideas
POD1000000023_S0000035	rationality is not a tool that gets us to objectivity about things
POD1000000023_S0000036	but it may get us a very effective mix of inter-subjectivity between cultures
POD1000000023_S0000037	rorty wants to offer an alternative way of looking at the legacy of the enlightenment
POD1000000023_S0000038	maybe it is pointless to try to do our best impressions of locke and kant and try to access the universe through reason
POD1000000023_S0000039	but when it comes to strictly human institutions for example the political realm where we're not trying to access things in themselves
POD1000000023_S0000040	we're just trying to figure out how we can live together the best maybe that is where rationality thrives as a method
POD1000000023_S0000041	what all this is alluding to is the fact that human rights are not the only things philosophers have tried to ground in universals in the past
POD1000000023_S0000042	the very structure of some political systems liberalism for example has also historically been grounded in universals
POD1000000023_S0000043	once again i just want to clarify because there are some people out there that get angry very quickly
POD1000000023_S0000044	and they also must be part of some sort of email club that's out there
POD1000000023_S0000045	when we're talking about liberalism as a foundation for society we're talking about a government with a focus on individual rights consent to the governed and aversion to any sort of collectivist system or systems that were popular at other points in history maybe a caste system for example
POD1000000023_S0000046	now you can imagine if you're a philosopher and you're trying to make a case for liberalism being better than a caste system
POD1000000023_S0000047	might be tempting to start to make an argument that human beings at the level of the universe are all equal and therefore should not be relegated to different ranks within a society
POD1000000023_S0000048	but to rorty this would be making the same mistake that locke and kant made in our example from before about human rights
POD1000000023_S0000049	the fact is to rorty we don't need that sort of ultimate foundation to be able to make a case for the fact that liberalism is how we should be running things
POD1000000023_S0000050	for many different reasons one like we already said we can't actually access the universe at that level through rationality
POD1000000023_S0000051	two society is just far better off when it can base public policy on the rational consensus of individual citizens rather than a philosophical theory arrived at by some guy in a tower that people might not even be able to relate to
POD1000000023_S0000052	think of the limitations you instantly place on yourself if you decide that every public policy or value of a society needs to be grounded in some philosophical justification that tells you how human beings are at large
POD1000000023_S0000053	first of all let's say you decided to structure your society around the political philosophy of plato
POD1000000023_S0000054	you're soon going to find yourself on a constant p r campaign trying to continually sell these ideas to a population just crossing your fingers that they go along with it
POD1000000023_S0000055	second of all almost always these philosophical ideas that you might structure your society around were created in an entirely different culture that emerged out of an entirely different history
POD1000000023_S0000056	which means these theories can bring a lot of baggage along with them that you may not want in the present culture
POD1000000023_S0000057	thirdly you are always going to be fighting a sort of losing battle to rorty because you will always be trying to cram one interpretation of how human life should be structured into the enormously complex pluralistic maelstrom of people coexisting together
POD1000000023_S0000058	rorty is essentially saying maybe we don't need the philosopher up in the tower thinking all day telling us how to structure our societies because well i've decided it shores up with how the universe is
POD1000000023_S0000059	maybe we don't have access to the way the universe is but maybe that doesn't matter maybe we don't need some elaborate philosophical theory to structure our society for us maybe a strategy is legitimate
POD1000000023_S0000060	liberalism for instance if the citizens of a particular culture positioned in history at a particular time and place all the citizens facing a very specific set of common problems that they need to solve
POD1000000023_S0000061	maybe a strategy is legitimate if the people of that society decide that they have confidence in it because one thing for sure one ultimate theory is not good enough
POD1000000023_S0000062	rorty who was a huge fan of isaiah berlin sometimes talks in his work about the quote fact of pluralism
POD1000000023_S0000063	this is what a society is to rorty we are worse off as a society if we try to use a single religious or philosophical theory to justify our political strategy
POD1000000023_S0000064	you will always be fighting a losing battle people will always arrive at a bunch of different conclusions
POD1000000023_S0000065	so instead of embarking on a never ending sales campaign for an idea rorty suggests that we allow our political strategy to reflect the common values of the people that make up the culture
POD1000000023_S0000066	you writes about how if we do this and we're careful eventually if you were having that same conversation at the beginning of the episode and you asked somebody what grounds human rights
POD1000000023_S0000067	the common tendency won't be to try to appeal to something written into the universe or to cite some religious or philosophical justification you read in a book somewhere
POD1000000023_S0000068	the new standard will be for people to see social policy as legitimate if it was approved by the people actually living in the culture
POD1000000023_S0000069	when asked the question what grounds this piece of social policy the answer won't involve pointing to some philosopher from three hundred years ago
POD1000000023_S0000070	you know descartes famous work a treatise concerning why drugs should be legalized and why you should be able to use your cellphone on an airplane no no
POD1000000023_S0000071	the authority lies in the hands of the set of people positioned in history with a very specific set of problems to solve that they care about
POD1000000023_S0000072	and once again to rorty not only do we not need any more authority than that we don't have access to any authority other than that and we're better off this way anyway
POD1000000023_S0000073	should be said this is yet another way we can access an answer to the question of how we can find a bridge between nature and culture
POD1000000023_S0000074	rorty obviously is not appealing to a single theory but he also is not appealing to pure relativism or historicism
POD1000000023_S0000075	his answers to these questions about how we can justify our political strategy place him in what i think is the most accurate category to describe some of his biggest ideas
POD1000000023_S0000076	rorty is often thought of as a pragmatist and i think we can understand rorty's overall position a little bit better if we take a second to talk about the concept of truth
POD1000000023_S0000077	more specifically the key differences between the traditional ways people have viewed the concept of truth and the way a pragmatist like rorty would've viewed the concept of truth
POD1000000023_S0000078	so let's talk first about one of the most common theories of what constitutes truth from the history of philosophy one that richard rorty thought has been dominant since the very beginning of the enlightenment
POD1000000023_S0000079	what he sometimes calls the representationalist paradigm sometimes called by others the correspondence theory of truth but let me take a second to tell you exactly what it is
POD1000000023_S0000080	the most basic idea is suppose somebody says a statement about the way things are in the world how do we tell if that statement is true
POD1000000023_S0000081	well that statement is true if it represents the way things really are in the world if there is a correspondence between the description and reality then we can say it's true
POD1000000023_S0000082	now there is of course mountains of detail that we could talk about here but richard rorty disagrees with the entire premise of the correspondence theory even at this basic rudimentary level
POD1000000023_S0000083	whenever you try to create a bridge between a description you have in your head and the reality of the world that you're looking at the only way you can ever describe anything is through language
POD1000000023_S0000084	language mediates our relationship with reality you can't access reality without language but to rorty it even goes one step further than this
POD1000000023_S0000085	not only is language a medium between us and reality but language actually constitutes reality
POD1000000023_S0000086	meaning that the language we use and the way we use it changes the way we think about reality
POD1000000023_S0000087	this could be an entire series on its own but the point is that certain languages and the cultures that use them favor certain habits of interpreting events
POD1000000023_S0000088	these interpretations greatly determine the entire way we see reality and the way human beings perceive reality varies greatly from culture to culture language to language
POD1000000023_S0000089	so the idea that there're some sort of correspondence or representation going on that the world out there is somehow helping us verify whether statements are true or false
POD1000000023_S0000090	that's just wrong because rorty thinks it would be impossible for us to ever step outside the parameters of language and access the world of things in themselves things independent of this language that we use to categorize them
POD1000000023_S0000091	he has a very famous quote that will be extremely useful for us for the remainder the episode he said quote the world does not speak only we do
POD1000000023_S0000092	the world can once we have programmed ourselves with a language cause us to hold beliefs but it cannot propose a language for us to speak only human beings can do that end quote
POD1000000023_S0000093	so it should be said rorty's not talking about ordinary language when he writes that he's talking about something else that we're going to get deep into here in a minute but i want to point out that this comparison he's making here
POD1000000023_S0000094	between accessing the world versus some sort of human created tool that's deeply affected by the bonds of history and culture
POD1000000023_S0000095	this is a classic move that rorty makes that if you were new to rorty might help you understand an outline of some of the topics he wants to cover for example language is extremely useful in human affairs
POD1000000023_S0000096	it's just not capable of describing the world of things in themselves outside of language
POD1000000023_S0000097	well consider how this compares to the beginning of the episode we have locke and kant trying to use reason to access some sort of ultimate truth about the universe but here's rorty saying that rationality is most useful in human affairs like the realm of the political
POD1000000023_S0000098	the world does not speak only we do here's another one from the enlightenment people like rousseau who believe in some sort of underlying human nature noble savages as he would say
POD1000000023_S0000099	really beyond that anyone that wants to take up the mantle of the common attitude that human beings at their very core dread seeing other human beings suffer
POD1000000023_S0000100	that's a common one for people to hold that naturally as human beings we don't want to see other people in pain so we can rely on the fact that if things ever got bad enough one culture would always come to the aid of another culture
POD1000000023_S0000101	rorty actually responds to this position directly in an interaction with simon critchley in the nineties so right here he is referencing the idea that there some sort of default altruism embedded into human nature
POD1000000023_S0000102	he says quote maybe there is such a sentient disposition but it is so malleable so capable of being combined with indifference to the suffering of people of the wrong sorts that it gives us precious little to rely on
POD1000000023_S0000103	we should just thank our lucky stars that there are quite a lot of people nowadays who are pretty consistently appalled by human beings suffering unnecessarily end quote
POD1000000023_S0000104	so he's saying maybe there is some aspect of human nature that makes people not want to see others suffer but if there is it's incredibly malleable
POD1000000023_S0000105	thank your lucky stars there happen to be a lot of people living today who don't want to see unnecessary suffering but the larger point there is that also if you're a fan of liberalism
POD1000000023_S0000106	there is nothing written into nature like a god or a priori facts that say liberalism is the way
POD1000000023_S0000107	but thank your lucky stars for the last couple hundred years there been a lot of people that believe in it as a strategy
POD1000000023_S0000108	so while we can understand the move that rorty's making here
POD1000000023_S0000109	placing a lot of authority in the hands of the people actually immersed in the culture this may start to bring up a whole new set of questions one of the most pressing might be this
POD1000000023_S0000110	if the authority of whether a social policy is good or not lies in the hands of the citizens and not even a philosopher can arrive at absolute foundations for even something as simple as human rights
POD1000000023_S0000111	don't those criticisms just instantly extend to my beliefs as an individual
POD1000000023_S0000112	like how am i supposed to ground my worldview in anything that's enduring enough that i can feel confident about it
POD1000000023_S0000113	the short answer to this question is that you can't and that shouldn't bother you
POD1000000023_S0000114	the longer answer can be found in rorty's lengthy exploration of the concept of irony
POD1000000023_S0000115	let's talk about it right now so a common email i get is from a person who says something to the effect of this
POD1000000023_S0000116	hi ah i've been listening to the show for a while i've heard about a bunch of different philosophers and i've gotten to a place where i feel the complexity of things makes me feel pretty uncertain about choosing a worldview
POD1000000023_S0000117	sometimes i feel agnostic about almost every issue of substance i can think of but this creates a problem for me because i still need to operate in day to day life
POD1000000023_S0000118	how is it possible to live a life where you're radically uncertain about things but still capable of functioning on an every day level
POD1000000023_S0000119	there are many answers to this question but richard rorty offers one of them through discussion of living a life as an ironist
POD1000000023_S0000120	now by ironist he doesn't mean you're smelting metal down at the home depot everyday the term ironist is a reference to irony
POD1000000023_S0000121	to fully understand the life of an ironist though we first need to understand the much more common almost ubiquitous way that people approach figuring things out about the world
POD1000000023_S0000122	a way of thinking deeply embedded in the history of philosophy
POD1000000023_S0000123	most people view their intellectual development as a person as a linear progression of moving past appearances and getting to the reality of the world
POD1000000023_S0000124	this goes all the way back to plato's allegory of the cave shadows on a cave wall we do the work of a philosopher and eventually can ascend out of the cave and see the sun or true knowledge for what it actually is
POD1000000023_S0000125	well this way of viewing ourselves has been a fixture in our cultures for so long that it's the way many people see their process of growth when learning about the world
POD1000000023_S0000126	there's this intuitive sense that we're born we're young dumb naive we get information from our teachers parents basic news sources and there's a sense in which we're living in a world of appearances at this point
POD1000000023_S0000127	see it's not until we've done the work of reading five newspapers a day reading a thousand books traveled to a hundred different countries not until we've done that can we say that we've arrived at a worldview that sees reality on reality's terms
POD1000000023_S0000128	but just as there's no single theory embedded into the universe about human rights or political strategy or anything for that matter
POD1000000023_S0000129	there's no single correct view of existence that you're somehow accessing through life experiences and reading a bunch of stuff
POD1000000023_S0000130	you may think that you have a rational justification for every view that you hold you may think it's the greatest worldview that it's ever been created
POD1000000023_S0000131	but it was created by you by a human being and rorty would say that although we often deceive ourselves into thinking it's the truth
POD1000000023_S0000132	really what we've created here is what he calls a final vocabulary
POD1000000023_S0000133	more on final vocabularies in one second but first i think it would be helpful to hear rorty talk about a key distinction between someone saying the world is out there and saying the truth is out there
POD1000000023_S0000134	and how these statements ultimately relate to the language we use he says quote we need to make a distinction between the claim that the world is out there and the claim that the truth is out there
POD1000000023_S0000135	to say that the world is out there that it is not our creation is to say with common sense that most things in space and time are the effects of causes which do not include human mental states
POD1000000023_S0000136	to say that the truth is not out there is simply to say that where there are no sentences there is no truth that sentences are elements of human languages
POD1000000023_S0000137	and that human languages are human creations truth cannot be out there it cannot exist independently of the human mind
POD1000000023_S0000138	because sentences cannot so exist or be out there the world is out there but descriptions of the world are not
POD1000000023_S0000139	only descriptions of the world can be true or false the world on its own unaided by the describing activities of human beings cannot end quote
POD1000000023_S0000140	this is one of rorty's most famous concepts what may refer to as the distinction between making and finding
POD1000000023_S0000141	locke and kant are not finding the truth about human rights they are using a very human process called reason to make a truth about human rights that we'd then use to structure our societies
POD1000000023_S0000142	liberalism was not found to be the best political strategy historical circumstances and common values among people made it the best political strategy for a time
POD1000000023_S0000143	when you read a thousand books you are not finding the truth about existence you are making a final vocabulary that allows you to interface with reality during the specific time that you happen to be living
POD1000000023_S0000144	by final vocabulary rorty means a collection of stories metaphors narratives discourses tons of different tools of rhetoric that you use to make sense of the world and see your place in it
POD1000000023_S0000145	this is called a final vocabulary because the things that make it up are often very final the foundations are probably not gonna develop any further because when it comes down to it if you were pressed hard enough
POD1000000023_S0000146	to explain your worldview by somebody skilled enough at arguing with enough time on their hands rorty says at eventually there would be no way for you to explain why your worldview is better than anyone else's in a non-circular way
POD1000000023_S0000147	it is a courageous thing to fight and die for your country because look fighting and dying for your country is like one of the most courageous things you can do the bible is true so you should trust the word of god
POD1000000023_S0000148	when pressed hard enough to justify your worldview in a conversation these are the sorts of stories and metaphors that ground the values of someone who thinks they got it all figured out
POD1000000023_S0000149	when the more accurate description is that they set up camp in an echo chamber of people that don't call them on their mistakes
POD1000000023_S0000150	either because they only talk to people who mostly agree with them already or because the people that disagree with them that they allow in to their circles lack the ability to press them further maybe people just want to be polite
POD1000000023_S0000151	maybe other people just don't care enough about changing someone into a little version of them to spend their time doing it
POD1000000023_S0000152	rorty prescribes an antidote to this way of thinking about getting past appearances to the reality of the world here is a pretty famous passage from his work that describes his three criteria for living life as an ironist
POD1000000023_S0000153	he says quote i shall define an ironist as someone who fulfills three conditions
POD1000000023_S0000154	one she has radical and continuing doubts about the final vocabulary she currently uses because she has been impressed by other vocabularies vocabularies taken as final by people or books she has encountered
POD1000000023_S0000155	two she realizes that argument phrased in her present vocabulary can neither underwrite nor dissolve these doubts
POD1000000023_S0000156	three in so far as she philosophizes about her situation she does not think that her vocabulary is closer to reality than others that it is in touch with a power not herself
POD1000000023_S0000157	ironists who are inclined to philosophize see the choice between vocabularies as made neither within a neutral or universal meta-vocabulary not by an attempt to fight one's way past appearances to the real but simply by playing the new off against the old
POD1000000023_S0000158	end quote so imagine living life as an ironist as opposed to this other type of person we were just talking about
POD1000000023_S0000159	you'd live your day to day life not like phyrro from ancient athens you are not gonna walk in front of cars doubting whether or not they're actually there you'd have a sort of working theory a final vocabulary that you use to function
POD1000000023_S0000160	the difference would be that you would have seen other final vocabularies seen their weaknesses
POD1000000023_S0000161	and you'd realize that yours is probably equally as flawed as there's in some way because it's not like you have special access to the truth
POD1000000023_S0000162	you don't have a deity backing your worldview you don't have some neutral point outside of culture and history that you're doing your thinking from you are just as fallible as they are
POD1000000023_S0000163	and your conclusions rely on history and culture just as much as theirs do you would have continuing radical doubt about your relationship with reality
POD1000000023_S0000164	you'd also realize that any attempt by you to argue that your final vocabulary is somehow superior to others is a pointless exercise and it's actually you engaging in that circular reasoning we were talking about before
POD1000000023_S0000165	because think about it you're arguing for a set of stories and narratives as being superior but all the while you're using that set of stories and narratives as the premise that you're starting your arguments from
POD1000000023_S0000166	this is why rorty thinks that when it comes to our final vocabularies arguing in the traditional sense is not a very effective way of making any progress at all
POD1000000023_S0000167	rorty says that an ironist always realizes that anything can be made to look good or bad by being re-described
POD1000000023_S0000168	because it's not like there some single argumentative standard out there
POD1000000023_S0000169	winning an argument in the times in napolean is just far different than winning an argument today
POD1000000023_S0000170	because the values of the people judging have changed the historical circumstances have changed the story about how the world fits together has changed different arguments are more effective in different final vocabularies
POD1000000023_S0000171	so if you are gonna argue with someone you are always relying on the fact that your points are gonna fit well into the final vocabulary the person that you're arguing with which is far from a guarantee
POD1000000023_S0000172	and the other side of that is that you may find yourself constantly arguing against a particular common final vocabulary that happens to dominate the culture you were born into
POD1000000023_S0000173	better to instead lead by example through irony when someone thinks they've lassoed the truth with their vocabulary they got it
POD1000000023_S0000174	the far more effective method will always be to do what rorty calls ironic disruption which doesn't mean you pull out your richard rorty handbook and argue them down point by point until they see the world the way that you do
POD1000000023_S0000175	the goal is through one method or another usually rhetorical devices
POD1000000023_S0000176	you try to allow this person to see on their own the perspective from outside their single worldview the hope being that once they're in this place will realize how limiting their basic way of viewing the world is
POD1000000023_S0000177	because it completely closes them off from new ways of connecting with people ideas and the world that is out there once again the world that is out there not the truth that is out there
POD1000000023_S0000178	to be in this place stepping outside of your worldview and seeing a completely different way the world can be rationally justified can be transformative
POD1000000023_S0000179	should be said this process also benefits the ironist because they need as much experience with final vocabularies as they can get they need to be able to spot these from a mile away
POD1000000023_S0000180	rorty says an passage that an ironist is never quite able to take themselves seriously
POD1000000023_S0000181	because they live their life acknowledging how much of their final vocabulary wasn't even a choice they consciously made
POD1000000023_S0000182	and that at any point some of the issues they believe in most strongly today might tomorrow change in a single conversation
POD1000000023_S0000183	this is a very different approach to your intellectual development and a very different way of approaching conversations with people that disagree with you politically
POD1000000023_S0000184	this person would seem like an alien in the current political landscape but this is ultimately the type of person that emerges in a pluralistic landscape of ideas rather than one that believes in a single correct answer to every political question
POD1000000023_S0000185	see you may wonder why bother why even spend a second of my life trying to talk to somebody showing them how they're limiting themselves to a single answer
POD1000000023_S0000186	let them do whatever it is they're gonna do but rorty would say that these people that truly believe they are reading books and getting past the world of appearances to the true reality of things
POD1000000023_S0000187	this outdated oversimplified attitude is responsible for so much of the cruelty that goes on in this world
POD1000000023_S0000188	liberal society in his eyes has a constant obligation to remind ourselves of the ways that the current order of things might be hurting people around us much more effective when you have a pluralistic outlook
POD1000000023_S0000190	you know there are relativists out there that would make an argument that everybody should stop fighting over their petty disagreements because ultimately everything is arbitrary
POD1000000023_S0000191	there are capital r rationalists out there that'll say everyone should stop fighting because well i've come up with the right answer i found it no more work to be done
POD1000000023_S0000192	the way richard rorty walks this line of nature and culture is partially through his beautiful use of pragmatism you know rorty wouldn't say you should care less he wouldn't say you should care more
POD1000000023_S0000193	what he would say i think though is that the substance of what we care about lies in solidarity amongst fellow human beings
POD1000000023_S0000194	that solidarity is what keeps us in line not a cosmic law that solidarity is what determines our values not some philosopher up in a tower
POD1000000023_S0000195	to understand the historical and cultural environment that you live in is only the first step towards understanding the solidarity that holds society together
POD1000000023_S0000196	he said it well when describing one of his books here and one of the most famous passages from any of his work
POD1000000023_S0000197	he says quote the fundamental premise of this book is that a belief can still regulate action can still be worth dying for among people who are quite aware that this belief is caused by nothing more than contingent historical circumstances
POD1000000023_S0000198	end quote
POD1000000023_S0000199	thank you for listening i'll talk to you next time
POD1000000024_S0000000	i dreaded doing the show sometimes because whatever it was
POD1000000024_S0000001	feelings
POD1000000024_S0000002	yeah feelings feelings
POD1000000024_S0000003	i don't know if we had sort of an acknowledgement at that point that things were strained between us
POD1000000024_S0000004	but we were definitely not as close as we had once been by the time that that was happening
POD1000000024_S0000005	and part of this period of time is about the weird duality between becoming recognized as friends more publicly
POD1000000024_S0000006	even as we were spending less time in that kind of intimate communication that really makes a friendship feel safe and secure
POD1000000024_S0000007	i don't know does that feel right to you sorry
POD1000000024_S0000008	that feels so right please be my spokesperson for everything thank you
POD1000000024_S0000010	i'm ann friedman co-host of the podcast call your girlfriend and a journalist

POD1000000024_S0000012	i am the other co-host of call your girlfriend and the co-author of big friendship with ann friedman
POD1000000024_S0000013	aminatou sow is a media strategist who was named to forbes thirty under thirty
POD1000000024_S0000014	ann friedman is a journalist whose writing has been in places like the new york times elle and the guardian
POD1000000024_S0000015	they have been best friends since two thousand and nine but for most of that time they lived on opposite coasts
POD1000000024_S0000016	in two thousand fourteen they started co-hosting the podcast call your girlfriend whose tag line is a podcast for long-distance besties everywhere
POD1000000024_S0000017	it gets hundreds of thousands of listeners
POD1000000024_S0000018	they record it from their respective homes just like they did for the interview for this episode
POD1000000024_S0000019	but maintaining a friendship across the country and across a professional collaboration hasn't always been easy
POD1000000024_S0000020	the geographic distance between them turned into emotional distance and they had to figure out a way to re-connect
POD1000000024_S0000021	they've co-written a book about it called big friendship which comes out in july
POD1000000024_S0000022	but that project is just the next chapter in their story which started over a decade ago
POD1000000024_S0000023	here's aminatou
POD1000000024_S0000025	ann and i met at a gossip girl viewing party in washington d c in two thousand nine
POD1000000024_S0000026	gossip core was important then it is still important today
POD1000000024_S0000028	that party was hosted by our mutual friend dio
POD1000000024_S0000029	she specifically invited both of us to that party having already identified that we would probably get along and be friends
POD1000000024_S0000030	in the same way that someone would like set you up on a blind date romantically
POD1000000024_S0000031	this was like a friendship like set up
POD1000000024_S0000032	i do remember just feeling like every comment and every joke and every little like aside or contribution she made to the kind of meta conversation happening about the t v show was just spot on
POD1000000024_S0000033	and just being like i could be here forever and listen to every single word that comes out of this woman's mouth
POD1000000024_S0000034	i just really liked your outfit ann
POD1000000024_S0000035	wow
POD1000000024_S0000036	i was like yes finally a good outfit in this town
POD1000000024_S0000037	like i remember that being really important to me
POD1000000024_S0000038	but i just remember really appreciating that this person was both like hilarious and also smart
POD1000000024_S0000039	and then much later when i connected the dots to the fact that oh you were the ann friedman whose byline i had read before i was like great
POD1000000024_S0000040	everything makes sense now of course
POD1000000024_S0000041	this woman who wears this jeans and t-shirts situation so perfectly also have like ten out of ten tastes in teen television
POD1000000024_S0000042	and so you know it worked out really well for me
POD1000000024_S0000043	it just was easy right away
POD1000000024_S0000044	and so things escalated like very fast
POD1000000024_S0000045	we really went zero to a hundred in like the first couple of months
POD1000000024_S0000046	when i picture this time in our lives i just picture us spending dozens of hours on one of our couches
POD1000000024_S0000047	we just spent so many hours doing nothing
POD1000000024_S0000048	and in that way it felt very much like a college or a teen friendship to me
POD1000000024_S0000049	our twenties were very much marked by a lot of like big group hangs you know
POD1000000024_S0000050	but i think ah for me that when i knew that we were going to be friends for a long time is when it was okay to be like actually i don't wanna be doing that
POD1000000024_S0000051	i just want to be taking our bras off on the couch and just talking about mundane stuff or like reading side-by-side like not really saying anything to each other
POD1000000024_S0000052	i had been living with a boyfriend and we broke up when you and i had been friends for six months or something like that
POD1000000024_S0000053	and then when i went to revise my h r paperwork at work like who is your next of kin or whatever they make you put down for work emergencies
POD1000000024_S0000054	at that point it was very clear that it was you
POD1000000024_S0000055	yeah by that point you were someone in my life where i was like yes give her my four-one-k
POD1000000024_S0000056	like please call her if i slip on a banana at work
POD1000000024_S0000058	this is the only capable person in my life thank you
POD1000000024_S0000059	your job at the banana factory
POD1000000024_S0000061	the people need to know
POD1000000024_S0000063	if i'm found in a ditch somewhere i hope that my phone literally says please call ann friedman
POD1000000024_S0000065	but we have now been friends who live apart for much longer than we were friends who lived in the same city
POD1000000024_S0000066	i knew that eventually you would move because we lived in a very transitional kind of city
POD1000000024_S0000067	and we had talked about it and it was like the great recession like people move to go to jobs like anywhere in the country
POD1000000024_S0000068	so it was not like it was a surprise that one of us would have to move
POD1000000024_S0000069	it just felt too soon
POD1000000024_S0000070	yeah and it's funny when i think about making that decision it was so wrapped up in work for me
POD1000000024_S0000071	like even though obviously i was physically leaving like our ability to spend all these hours on the couch together
POD1000000024_S0000072	i didn't feel like our friendship was going to end or even be existentially threatened by the fact that i was moving away
POD1000000024_S0000073	and that's not to say that i wasn't sad about it or that it was easy
POD1000000024_S0000074	it's just at the time it really just felt like okay like we're going to be as close as we ever were
POD1000000024_S0000075	it's just gonna look a little different
POD1000000024_S0000076	i was devastated when you moved away ann and i remember very consciously having to make a choice of like i will never show this person that i am bummed out by this
POD1000000024_S0000077	because i knew just how important it was for you and i was also really excited for you that you were actually on a path to do something that you wanted to do
POD1000000024_S0000078	i don't shine if you don't shine is something that amina first said to me and then we would say to each other
POD1000000024_S0000079	mostly i think as an assurance when one of us was worried she was taking up too much space in the other's brain or life or whatever
POD1000000024_S0000080	maybe asking for too much support or help a way of reassuring each other that we were invested in each other
POD1000000024_S0000081	and i don't shine if you don't shine was the assurance that underpinned a lot of those conversations
POD1000000024_S0000082	i have always felt that collaboration is better than competition
POD1000000024_S0000083	every success in my life is a testament to that
POD1000000024_S0000084	and somewhere along the line we started calling it shine theory privately
POD1000000024_S0000085	and then in twenty thirteen i was a columnist for the cut and wrote about it in a column
POD1000000024_S0000086	and lots of people read and shared the column and then it became a lot bigger than we had anticipated
POD1000000024_S0000087	but like all things that go viral there are also a lot of complications where you're like great is everyone really on the same page about what we're talking about
POD1000000024_S0000088	i remember much to my surprise and horror shinetheory dot com had already been bought
POD1000000024_S0000089	a woman who ran a fitness studio was using it to push some sort of like miss fitness studio contest
POD1000000024_S0000090	my name was on the website
POD1000000024_S0000091	and so a lawyer was hired
POD1000000024_S0000092	and i think that having to go through this experience with you ann like i make decisions differently when i'm making decisions with someone than i do if i'm making them for myself
POD1000000024_S0000093	you really learn that like people have different appetites for negotiation
POD1000000024_S0000094	and like people have you know like a different style that they want to be combative or not combative in and whatever
POD1000000024_S0000095	i think that having to sort out a lot of those kinks through this process illuminated a lot of things
POD1000000024_S0000096	and you know like one of them being like okay this really sucks but i really like the person i have to do this with
POD1000000024_S0000097	it was important to me that we were able to make a decision this big together
POD1000000024_S0000098	you know it was like that was not falling apart
POD1000000024_S0000099	the point at which we were trying to figure out what to do about the shinetheory trademark was actually several months or maybe even dragged out for like more than a year
POD1000000024_S0000100	and that period of time i don't know if we had sort of an acknowledgement at that point that things were strained between us
POD1000000024_S0000101	but we were definitely not as close as we had once been by the time that that was happening
POD1000000024_S0000102	i think that we were entering into a period where a lot of things that we were compartmentalizing were starting to become problems you know
POD1000000024_S0000103	like we were both changing and going through really hard things in our own lives very far apart physically and emotionally in most cases
POD1000000024_S0000104	and i think for me also like this has been the central the lesson that i am learning as as i grow up every day
POD1000000024_S0000105	people are changing constantly
POD1000000024_S0000106	and it is really hard to do a check in every day and realize that you are different than you were yesterday
POD1000000024_S0000107	and so i think that even if we were like living in the same city or we you know like bought a house together and we were roommates or whatever i still think that we would we would be two different people
POD1000000024_S0000108	clinging onto an idea of who i think someone is is very reassuring
POD1000000024_S0000109	but in that like you don't give people room to change their minds or to explore new things or to do new things and so
POD1000000024_S0000110	we were different and we didn't acknowledge it at the beginning and then we were changing and didn't realize that we were changing
POD1000000024_S0000111	and there was so much to account for in that gap
POD1000000024_S0000112	and so for each of us deciding to share less of ourselves was sometimes a conscious and sometimes a totally unconscious reflexive decision
POD1000000024_S0000113	yet we had all of this communication related to hosting a podcast together
POD1000000024_S0000114	for years and years and years the only podcast that i listened to was this american life
POD1000000024_S0000115	so it never even occurred to me that it was something we could do
POD1000000024_S0000116	but i had met gina delvac our producer through ann and some of ann's friends in l a and at some point somewhere in palm springs
POD1000000024_S0000117	like between probably drugs and wine for me it was suggested that we could do a podcast
POD1000000024_S0000118	i think she was just like you guys have good chemistry and you should think about doing this
POD1000000024_S0000119	and i'm also pretty sure we said that standard thing that i hear most people who are women say when you suggest they record themselves which is i hate my voice why would i do that or something like that
POD1000000024_S0000120	you know i'm pretty sure we were kind of dismissive but then also that we thought about it and talked about it and
POD1000000024_S0000121	several weeks later
POD1000000024_S0000122	do you remember when we were in the car and you bought the u r l on your phone
POD1000000024_S0000123	yes we came up with the name in the car
POD1000000024_S0000124	i confess that if i had really sat there and thought for longer than thirty seconds the show probably would not be called call your girlfriend
POD1000000024_S0000125	it would be called something else
POD1000000024_S0000126	indeed
POD1000000024_S0000127	but this is how we work
POD1000000024_S0000128	nothing is real unless there is a website
POD1000000024_S0000129	nothing is real unless you've had a meeting about it
POD1000000024_S0000130	and gina had done all of the work to say this is what we think it could be
POD1000000024_S0000131	and because she did that it made me feel like we could actually do it
POD1000000024_S0000132	we didn't think that tons of strangers would listen to it
POD1000000024_S0000133	i think some like a huge part of the show's success honestly is that we backed into all of these things
POD1000000024_S0000134	if they had come to me and said hey do you want to run a small media company where we have to get a government e i n and we have to do payroll
POD1000000024_S0000135	i would have said absolutely not please never speak to me again this is not what i want to do
POD1000000024_S0000136	and it sounds like a really dumb thing to say now but it never occurred to me that people who were not our friends would listen to it
POD1000000024_S0000137	hi welcome to call your girlfriend
POD1000000024_S0000138	a podcast for a long distance besties everywhere
POD1000000024_S0000139	um usually we are long distance besties but today we are in the same room
POD1000000024_S0000140	i know we are cheating and i love it
POD1000000024_S0000141	but i dreaded doing the show sometimes because whatever it was
POD1000000024_S0000142	feelings
POD1000000024_S0000143	yeah feelings
POD1000000024_S0000144	when we are not communicating well and you add distance to it like that was an issue
POD1000000024_S0000145	or always thinking like okay we'll deal with this later
POD1000000024_S0000146	there was always like a thing you know like a small thing that you would deal with later and then that jar got full and you're like oh this is a lot of stuff
POD1000000024_S0000147	and it happened in so many little ways that we didn't really even fully acknowledge it until things had gotten really bad
POD1000000024_S0000148	and then i think part of this period of time is about the weird duality between becoming recognized as friends more publicly
POD1000000024_S0000149	even as we were spending less time in that kind of intimate communication that really makes a friendship feel safe and secure
POD1000000024_S0000150	i don't know does that feel right to you sorry
POD1000000024_S0000152	that feels so right please be my spokesperson for everything thank you
POD1000000024_S0000154	there was sort of this illusion that we were still in touch in the same way we had always been
POD1000000024_S0000155	even though we weren't actually talking in like truly intimate ways about what was happening in each of our lives
POD1000000024_S0000156	we were kind of talking about logistical things for work or we were talking about the news or pop culture on the podcast
POD1000000024_S0000157	you know the kinds of conversations that really underpinned our relationship in the beginning just weren't happening anymore with the same frequency
POD1000000024_S0000158	i knew that we weren't doing well but i knew that you didn't hate me
POD1000000024_S0000159	the thing that was hard about our conflict is that we loved each other but we didn't know how to communicate with each other
POD1000000024_S0000160	i don't remember what the words were that you said in that conversation but i just remember the relief i felt when you told me that you didn't feel good
POD1000000024_S0000161	i feel awful i think is what i
POD1000000024_S0000163	thank you ann
POD1000000024_S0000166	should have been a scary moment
POD1000000024_S0000167	should've been like oh no and instead i was like thank god finally like it's all on the table
POD1000000024_S0000168	and i remember just feeling there is a huge sense of relief of great we are having a breakdown and we are talking about it i love it
POD1000000024_S0000169	and so that's how we ended up at couples therapy
POD1000000024_S0000170	doesn't it feel good to laugh about this now
POD1000000024_S0000171	oh like oh expensive every laugh is the sound of thousands of therapy dollars
POD1000000024_S0000173	we would like i don't know record the podcast and then you know like hang up that equipment well are you ready to go to doctor so-and-so later
POD1000000024_S0000174	show up to therapy do that really hard work and also sometimes like agree or disagree with the therapist and be able to talk to each other about it
POD1000000024_S0000175	there is something about that that felt like such an out of body experience to me where it was like am i really this grown-up
POD1000000024_S0000176	who like i worked with this person we are now at our therapist and now we're gonna go home and lay on the floor because this was so hard
POD1000000024_S0000177	if you had not been at those therapy sessions with me i would not believe that it would've happened
POD1000000024_S0000178	but it did happen and somehow we did it
POD1000000024_S0000179	right we both still wanted to be there
POD1000000024_S0000180	and like i think about that saying about like how do you stay married you just don't get divorced or whatever i don't know
POD1000000024_S0000181	but i will say that like we were both continuing to show up
POD1000000024_S0000182	in our friendship i've learned a lot about being someone who who doesn't run away from their commitments
POD1000000024_S0000183	we felt like this experience we had had trying to repair an intimate friendship that had like hit the rocks is not something we saw reflected anywhere
POD1000000024_S0000184	and so there was a motivation i think to try to put some of this down in words
POD1000000024_S0000185	i think we started to talk about writing a book proposal in maybe twenty-seventeen does that sound right
POD1000000024_S0000186	yeah when it came to audio neither of us knew what we were doing and it was very much like okay great like we're starting from scratch
POD1000000024_S0000187	and with this you know ann is a writer
POD1000000024_S0000188	and i'm her friend but i'm also her fan
POD1000000024_S0000189	like i've read ann for years
POD1000000024_S0000190	and so i was really thinking about like how is this collaboration going to work
POD1000000024_S0000191	we sold this book as like we are two co-equal authors and i was like great
POD1000000024_S0000192	i'm like paired up with an olympian and now we have to do hurdles
POD1000000024_S0000194	you know a lot of books that are co-written
POD1000000024_S0000195	you know in this fifty-fifty way have you know chapter one is by one person and then chapter two is by the other person and they kind of volley back and forth
POD1000000024_S0000196	and we made a choice pretty early on that we wanted to have one narrative
POD1000000024_S0000197	and so as a project it is really impossible to disentangle our various inputs
POD1000000024_S0000198	and i don't know i feel like that feels truer to me in the sense of like that's really what a friendship feels like
POD1000000024_S0000199	and the way we did that is we outline together quite meticulously and then we would take a section of the outline split up
POD1000000024_S0000200	we'd each write narratively that section of the outline on our separate computers and then we would each read aloud what we had written to the other
POD1000000024_S0000201	and then we would knit them together and keep the best parts of both and then move on to the next section of the outline for seventy thousand words
POD1000000024_S0000202	wow
POD1000000024_S0000203	can you believe we did that
POD1000000024_S0000204	i'm just like saying that out loud it's wild
POD1000000024_S0000206	my truly like favorite moments of our writing process is when i would be frustrated or ready to give up and i would look around
POD1000000024_S0000207	and you were typing away furiously with your signature ann friedman typing noises and exclaim out loud i love words those were the moments
POD1000000024_S0000208	i can't believe you're outing me like this
POD1000000024_S0000209	i am outing you you are a capricorn writer and it is disgusting to be a part of but also it's you know i'm like we got we did it
POD1000000024_S0000210	my favorite moments are hearing you from like the other end of the house be like okay okay
POD1000000024_S0000212	like i can tell you we're really working through something
POD1000000024_S0000213	like you had really had a breakthrough
POD1000000024_S0000215	one thing that is truly consistent across every year of our friendship is that like i always do want to know what you think
POD1000000024_S0000216	i always do think you have the best jokes
POD1000000024_S0000217	like that is like never ever changed

POD1000000024_S0000234	from p r x
POD1000000026_S0000000	i was like mike i really want to work together
POD1000000026_S0000001	and i just remember his response he was like count me interested
POD1000000026_S0000002	and i don't know how you proposed to your wife but when you asked her to marry you if she had come back said and said count me interested
POD1000000026_S0000004	would you have been like that was a yes
POD1000000026_S0000005	i mean come on
POD1000000026_S0000006	i would have asked for clarification
POD1000000026_S0000008	i'm mike krieger i was co-founder and former c t o of instagram
POD1000000026_S0000009	i'm kevin systrom former c e o and co-founder of instagram
POD1000000026_S0000011	kevin systrom and mike krieger co-founded instagram in two thousand ten
POD1000000026_S0000012	a year half later they sold it to facebook for a billion dollars
POD1000000026_S0000013	they stayed on to run the company for another six years
POD1000000026_S0000014	and then in two thousand eighteen they left together
POD1000000026_S0000015	and even now they still work together
POD1000000026_S0000016	the first time they met though they had no idea that it would lead to something so meaningful
POD1000000026_S0000017	in fact kevin doesn't even remember that first time they met
POD1000000026_S0000019	i'd like to say i do i really don't um
POD1000000026_S0000020	the first time i remember meeting mike was in coffee bar the small cafe in san francisco
POD1000000026_S0000021	it became my go to office because i had left my job and i was working on this app called burbn
POD1000000026_S0000022	and it was just me
POD1000000026_S0000023	i knew of mike i had seen him like we were in the same circles
POD1000000026_S0000024	and i recognized mike and i walked over to say hello
POD1000000026_S0000025	but the first thing i noticed was the thing he was working on
POD1000000026_S0000026	it was like this beautiful website
POD1000000026_S0000027	and i didn't realize he was working with a designer
POD1000000026_S0000028	so anyway in my mind mike was like this amazing designer
POD1000000026_S0000029	little did i know that actually he was an amazing engineer
POD1000000026_S0000031	i don't know that you've ever touched photoshop actually
POD1000000026_S0000033	actually that's not true
POD1000000026_S0000034	i built the shutter on the very first version of instagram and it was very basic
POD1000000026_S0000035	wasn't the shutter literally just two gray sliders that just closed and opened
POD1000000026_S0000036	that's what i said very basic
POD1000000026_S0000038	that was not that was not that good honestly
POD1000000026_S0000040	but that was the first time i remember hanging out with you cause i remember being so impressed
POD1000000026_S0000041	and i asked you what tool you were using
POD1000000026_S0000042	and i don't remember the tool but i remember using it and just being like oh man like
POD1000000026_S0000043	so good to have like a mike in your life where you can ask him a question they just always have the best answer
POD1000000026_S0000044	and it turns out years later i still feel like that's true
POD1000000026_S0000045	i remember thinking oh here's somebody who's actually like pursuing something that he's excited about
POD1000000026_S0000046	actually building it and like oh a kindred spirit that's here on the weekends not just to check facebook or do something but is it building
POD1000000026_S0000047	so having another builder was exciting i'm like oh somebody else cares about the stuff
POD1000000026_S0000048	i think maybe where mike and i overlap most is the fact that we both love to make things
POD1000000026_S0000049	my dream was always to build something that a lot of people used
POD1000000026_S0000050	so our friendship revolves around that
POD1000000026_S0000051	and it just so happens that that also happens to be a profession
POD1000000026_S0000052	i did know that he was working on burbn
POD1000000026_S0000053	i think i already had maybe installed it and just playing around with it
POD1000000026_S0000054	was a check in app it let you check in at different places
POD1000000026_S0000055	it was a way of sharing what you were up to and where you were
POD1000000026_S0000056	with the twist that you can add photos and videos to it which in two thousand and nine was actually the only one i could find that could do that
POD1000000026_S0000057	and even though you had to jump through all these hoops to upload a photo on burbn
POD1000000026_S0000058	people were doing it and all of a sudden it wasn't just this person is here but oh that's what it looks like there
POD1000000026_S0000059	so that was to me the inkling of something interesting in burbn
POD1000000026_S0000060	but you know i was pitching it to investors and one of the investors was like yeah here's fifty grand
POD1000000026_S0000061	you can go work on this and like take a small small stipend
POD1000000026_S0000062	but you have to get a co-founder these things work best when you have a co-founder
POD1000000026_S0000063	he was saying hey look at all the best companies in the world
POD1000000026_S0000064	they were like ones that really work are the ones were generally there's more than one solo person running the ship
POD1000000026_S0000065	google was a co-founder pair
POD1000000026_S0000066	youtube was a co-founder pair
POD1000000026_S0000067	the point is when you have a team you're more likely to succeed
POD1000000026_S0000068	and i agreed with that i mean the pattern was clearly there the evidence was there
POD1000000026_S0000069	so kind of went through the rolodex in my mind of like who do i know that could be a co-founder
POD1000000026_S0000070	and i remember running into mike and i think the next time i ran to him i floated the idea hey like maybe we should work together on this
POD1000000026_S0000071	we basically decided we were going to prototype working together
POD1000000026_S0000072	so we would get together at a cafe near mike's house and we created a fake project
POD1000000026_S0000073	why we didn't just work on burbn i don't know but we created a fake project with a fake outcome we wanted to accomplish that night
POD1000000026_S0000074	mike would do one half of it i'd do a different half of it and we'd come together and we'd ask questions figure out how each other worked
POD1000000026_S0000075	and we really enjoyed that experience
POD1000000026_S0000076	so you know i remember this fateful day standing at the caltrain station before mike had to go to work and
POD1000000026_S0000077	i was like mike i really want to work together
POD1000000026_S0000078	in my head i was probably like i really want to work together and i really need this fifty thousand dollars that's right so i need a co-founder too
POD1000000026_S0000079	and i asked him this question and i just remember his response he was like count me interested
POD1000000026_S0000081	count me interested like you know are you in or are you out
POD1000000026_S0000082	i vividly remember the moment he asked because i had one of those life flashing before your eyes but not the past the future
POD1000000026_S0000083	i was like okay i can be working with somebody who i have come to really start respecting and i wanna work with
POD1000000026_S0000084	and that's where count me interested came from which to me sounded like a yes but maybe i was a little coy
POD1000000026_S0000085	but to me it was just like oh yeah of course
POD1000000026_S0000086	i i'm gonna ask you a question okay
POD1000000026_S0000087	i want a little bit of
POD1000000026_S0000088	understanding here
POD1000000026_S0000089	you're now married
POD1000000026_S0000090	i don't know how you proposed your wife but when you asked her to marry you if she had come back said and said count me interested
POD1000000026_S0000091	would you have been like that was a yes
POD1000000026_S0000093	asked for clarification
POD1000000026_S0000095	i look back and a lot of the major decisions in my life that i've made
POD1000000026_S0000096	this one was an easier one where i knew that it was what i wanted to do and then the next week was logistically can i do it
POD1000000026_S0000097	you know i've come from brazil i was on a work visa
POD1000000026_S0000098	you were taking on so much risk because you had everything set
POD1000000026_S0000099	they gave you a job you had this work visa everything
POD1000000026_S0000100	and you were jumping in like i think back how crazy we were to do that
POD1000000026_S0000101	we had to like form a company so that the government would be like okay you can have this visa
POD1000000026_S0000102	i think this was the first moment where i really started feeling this sort of mutual trust with kevin
POD1000000026_S0000103	cause the count me interested moment was january and we applied you know soon afterwards
POD1000000026_S0000104	and eighty days goes by ninety days goes by
POD1000000026_S0000105	and i was like kev look i know you want to get this off the ground
POD1000000026_S0000106	and it's like march it's april now like
POD1000000026_S0000107	three months is forever and startup land like if you want to cut this and be like i'm just gonna find a u s co-founder that can make this work i'll get it
POD1000000026_S0000108	and i remember kevin was like no man like we're gonna make this work
POD1000000026_S0000109	let's email the lawyer let's like keep pushing forward like no we'll wait we'll figure this out and
POD1000000026_S0000110	that meant so much to me
POD1000000026_S0000111	i mean it still does like cause he could have easily been like yeah man this is too hard i need to get this going
POD1000000026_S0000112	and that would have been a rational decision to have made
POD1000000026_S0000113	but instead he was like no let's like figure this out and
POD1000000026_S0000114	it finally came and that point it was like all right i can actually join and actually do this stuff together
POD1000000026_S0000115	we had been working on burbn for a while eight nine months or something by that time
POD1000000026_S0000116	and we were meeting one of our early investors
POD1000000026_S0000117	and he was like so what are you building what's up like what's new
POD1000000026_S0000118	and we're like well you know we have these features and we it does this thing and it does this thing
POD1000000026_S0000119	and he his face was just blank
POD1000000026_S0000120	like he's just looking at us like what are you talking i don't understand what you're trying to build
POD1000000026_S0000121	and we were so sad after that meeting because it was so clear to us that we couldn't explain what we were working on
POD1000000026_S0000122	so we went back to the office we sat in front of a whiteboard and we said okay we have to focus this thing
POD1000000026_S0000123	it's trying to do too much all at once
POD1000000026_S0000124	so we stripped everything away that day
POD1000000026_S0000125	and we focused just on the components that would effectively become instagram
POD1000000026_S0000126	and maybe in the course of a week or two made the first version of instagram
POD1000000026_S0000127	i spent far more time with kevin than any other human being for that first year of instagram easily right we were in there every single day
POD1000000026_S0000128	for thirteen fourteen hours sometimes over night
POD1000000026_S0000129	you know mike would be brushing his teeth in the employee bathroom you know at four a m just because like we had been there all night
POD1000000026_S0000130	we got to launch day we launch it to the world
POD1000000026_S0000131	october sixth two thousand ten i know that date and the date of my daughter's birth those are the two dates i will never forget right
POD1000000026_S0000132	people liked it people started using it
POD1000000026_S0000133	and i was taken aback because i mean i had worked at a company before that struggled to get ten thousand people to use it over a year
POD1000000026_S0000134	and we got to twenty-five thousand that first day
POD1000000026_S0000135	and i remember turning to mike and i said i think we've created something
POD1000000026_S0000136	i'm usually the pessimist and mike is usually i i'm not sure optimist but you're pragmatist right
POD1000000026_S0000137	but like i had this moment of clarity that there was something special cause i'd never seen people react this way
POD1000000026_S0000138	and mike just looked at me like i don't know maybe not maybe this is all going to come crashing down
POD1000000026_S0000139	the one little dinky server that we had was just like metaphorically and perhaps physically melting by the all the traffic that was coming at it
POD1000000026_S0000140	i really felt like we had squandered this opportunity
POD1000000026_S0000141	and i was like should probably add another server
POD1000000026_S0000142	and kevin was like no we don't need another server
POD1000000026_S0000143	and you know in in retrospect i think it was like you know we didn't know if this thing was going to take off and it was expensive to add another server like did we really need it
POD1000000026_S0000144	and i was no i think we do
POD1000000026_S0000145	and then mike later he oh man sorry like i was a little heated
POD1000000026_S0000146	you know we had been up for thirty-six hours at that point you know kind of fighting off sleep and also excited
POD1000000026_S0000148	both the best and worst days of our lives
POD1000000026_S0000149	it was like you know the thing was working but also was crashing
POD1000000026_S0000150	i think that was the only time we've ever raised our voices with each other
POD1000000026_S0000151	it was brief it was like a probably thirty second interaction
POD1000000026_S0000152	i approve this message
POD1000000026_S0000154	which is true like that was the one time that ah it was heated and it was just the heat of the moment
POD1000000026_S0000155	actually i'm gonna take it way back at our first disagreement which actually i haven't thought about in many years
POD1000000026_S0000156	two or three weeks into working together i remember coming in and saying
POD1000000026_S0000157	what do you think of us like one or two days a week just working from home cause i can just jam on stuff and just stay up all night and code and i'll be up until noon
POD1000000026_S0000158	you know like i think i'll work better that way and you're like
POD1000000026_S0000159	no i'd really like for us to be in the same office together i think that matters a lot
POD1000000026_S0000160	and i remember being annoyed for like ten seconds
POD1000000026_S0000162	i was like yeah okay like sure like we'd give that a try
POD1000000026_S0000163	you know and like in the end it was great like we were able to jam on ideas and move really quickly and
POD1000000026_S0000164	if i had to like abstract it and what i learned about working with kevin over the years it was i don't think you're ever a person that will just agree to something because it will make somebody else happy
POD1000000026_S0000165	but you also make sure that in disagreeing you're also not being a jerk and making them feel bad about feeling differently you're like
POD1000000026_S0000166	no i've thought about this and here's you know what i wanna do before
POD1000000026_S0000167	is there like a reason why you know you really feel differently and then we can have the conversation
POD1000000026_S0000168	that sort of like detoxified ability to disagree is really important
POD1000000026_S0000169	i get annoyed really easily
POD1000000026_S0000170	but interesting thing is mike doesn't annoy me like he really doesn't
POD1000000026_S0000171	like i really don't get annoyed with mike cause he has character and integrity
POD1000000026_S0000172	those are the two things i care about
POD1000000026_S0000173	like you're just a generally good person and when you say you're going to do something you do it
POD1000000026_S0000174	who cares if like you know mike chose the wrong x y or z to solve a problem or maybe introduced a bug or what like i don't care
POD1000000026_S0000175	mike has never made except for that one time on the server issue mike has never made me angry
POD1000000026_S0000176	i don't think we ever actually had titles for the longest time
POD1000000026_S0000177	i guess once we started doing public you know events we had to talk about what our titles were
POD1000000026_S0000178	there was a time where we were like okay you're c t o i'm c e o we kind of like divided it that way
POD1000000026_S0000179	but you always say co-founder first that's the title
POD1000000026_S0000180	when i thought about my identity and like what we were doing in the company it was like co-founder maybe technical co-founder if you wanted to put an adjective in front of it
POD1000000026_S0000181	required technical co-founder
POD1000000026_S0000184	but i do also think and this speaks to our personality and our relationship it is really important for any company to ultimately have one final decision maker
POD1000000026_S0000185	and i've seen so many companies not have one and it become a mess sometimes there's a tie break needed or sometimes like a call needs to get made
POD1000000026_S0000186	you really need to find somebody who's willing to like make that call and you all have to be ready to like make that person successful in that role or else it's just not gonna work
POD1000000026_S0000187	we had a bunch of people that really wanted instagram inside their company
POD1000000026_S0000188	but we were having so much fun doing our own thing that like we just didn't wanna like be part of any other company
POD1000000026_S0000189	we didn't want to be a wing of a building we wanted to be the building
POD1000000026_S0000190	and i remember you turned to me at one point you're like i really don't think we should like pursue any of these
POD1000000026_S0000191	like i think we're better off independent but if you feel differently like let me know like let's have that conversation
POD1000000026_S0000192	which was helpful is that made me reflect and be like no no this is really fun
POD1000000026_S0000193	like i'm working with somebody i deeply respect we're starting to build a team that's working
POD1000000026_S0000194	yeah let's like let's keep doing this thing we've still got money in the bank
POD1000000026_S0000195	so you know for the longest time we were just like we're gonna do this thing ourselves
POD1000000026_S0000196	and the only time we literally had like a number to face was the facebook offer
POD1000000026_S0000197	when we were like oh a billion dollars just sounds funny to say right like
POD1000000026_S0000198	it's a billion ah ah you think of like dr evil or one of these movies right
POD1000000026_S0000199	but someone comes along and offers you a billion dollars for something you've been working on for i don't know all of a year publicly and then you've got eleven employees and you're just like man i'm like how do you even do that calculus like
POD1000000026_S0000200	what do you say to that
POD1000000026_S0000201	i really remember being in sort of like a a daze it's like everything was just very strange
POD1000000026_S0000202	we had long conversation about what we want to do
POD1000000026_S0000203	at the end of the day the thing that mattered the most to us was that they wanted us to keep running it independently like we had been doing they
POD1000000026_S0000204	they were like no instagram's a thing
POD1000000026_S0000205	you're a community you guys have effectively a team and a company and a culture
POD1000000026_S0000206	keep doing that
POD1000000026_S0000207	and we stayed six years
POD1000000026_S0000208	there was a lot of like hey checking in how are you feeling what do you want to do like
POD1000000026_S0000209	we only wanted to be at instagram if the other person was at instagram
POD1000000026_S0000210	every january i would decide i wanted to consciously recommit to still being there
POD1000000026_S0000211	make it an intentional choice
POD1000000026_S0000212	like i come around in january and i say is this still what i want to be learning
POD1000000026_S0000213	i vow to myself it's funny the vows you make to yourself when you're eighteen years old
POD1000000026_S0000214	i vowed to myself when i was eighteen i wanted to have a life full of unique years not the same year over and over again
POD1000000026_S0000215	like that was my biggest fear
POD1000000026_S0000216	and i looked and i was like i feel like you know we've done incredibly hard things
POD1000000026_S0000217	i've learned a ton but it feels like we're on some like diminishing returns curve of learning
POD1000000026_S0000218	and i remember i had dinner with kevin i was like hey man like i feel like it might be time for me to try something different which is like a hard conversation like it's a scary conversation to have
POD1000000026_S0000219	i remember kevin turned to me and said like i get where you're coming from
POD1000000026_S0000220	is there anything that you think would still feel like a new interesting thing
POD1000000026_S0000221	i like listed a couple of things
POD1000000026_S0000222	and then will i had the interesting experience of kind of doing part of kevin's job for a few months cause he went out on paternity leave
POD1000000026_S0000223	and he was out he was like mike i'm on paternity leave i really want to be present with my kid mike
POD1000000026_S0000224	can you make sure things go well while i'm away
POD1000000026_S0000225	and it was interesting because in my head i always had this question like is the one thing that i would make me stay like to have this very different experience of being c e o rather than c t o
POD1000000026_S0000226	and i got to have that experience for like two months
POD1000000026_S0000227	i remember kevin getting back i was like kevin i do not want your job at all
POD1000000026_S0000228	and like we'd always joke that one of the reasons we work together is that we didn't want each other's jobs
POD1000000026_S0000229	and at some point it felt like a thing i had always said and i wanted to make sure it was actually really true
POD1000000026_S0000230	but i remember at the end of that experience being like no i'm really glad i got to try cause it made me realize where my happy spot is is not in that role
POD1000000026_S0000231	it's in the role i was in it and that role i feel like i've accomplished what i wanted to accomplish
POD1000000026_S0000232	and i wanted something hard
POD1000000026_S0000233	and i wanted to be bad at something again
POD1000000026_S0000234	maybe it won't be as big as instagram maybe it won't
POD1000000026_S0000235	probably won't be as big as instagram let's be honest
POD1000000026_S0000236	but maybe it'll be just as fun to learn along the way
POD1000000026_S0000237	that's ultimately what made me want to jump
POD1000000026_S0000238	but we had no idea what we were gonna do
POD1000000026_S0000239	the first thing was rest and recovery
POD1000000026_S0000240	we were kind of off doing our own thing we wanted to just chill out and disconnect a little bit but we reconnected and it was like yeah what do you miss the most
POD1000000026_S0000241	it's like well i miss hanging out of course and you say those nice things to each other but i miss building stuff
POD1000000026_S0000242	i learned a big lesson i think in the middle months before we really reconnected which was i think i'm holding this idea of kevin in my head of like
POD1000000026_S0000243	i bet he's like already thought of like what's next and like he hasn't told me about it
POD1000000026_S0000244	and i realized like
POD1000000026_S0000245	oh no really
POD1000000026_S0000246	no i created this like thing of like oh like we haven't talked in a few months
POD1000000026_S0000247	and if you think about it i've never you know actually thought about this but like that was the longest we went without really talking in nine years
POD1000000026_S0000248	so like
POD1000000026_S0000250	it was like man like we haven't talked which must mean that like he doesn't want to talk to me
POD1000000026_S0000251	and i remember having this phone call that was so like what a relief like we talked on the phone and you're like yeah like i'm where you are
POD1000000026_S0000252	like i haven't thought about what's next and i'd love to work with you and i love like to love to keep working with you too
POD1000000026_S0000253	to me the lesson learned was like if you have like a very close relationship with somebody and then you just don't talk to them for a few months like
POD1000000026_S0000254	your brain is gonna start assuming that that silence means something that absolutely doesn't
POD1000000026_S0000255	it just meant that we just needed some time to clear our heads and have our own thing
POD1000000026_S0000256	and once he talked i was like oh okay great he feels the same way i do which is like we don't know exactly what it is yet but we want to do it with each other
POD1000000026_S0000257	and that was a real like relief for me i was like great we're on the same page and now we can just spend the time to explore and figure out what we're excited to build next
POD1000000026_S0000258	both of us wanted to do something together again
POD1000000026_S0000259	like that was rare like most co-founder pairs find themselves in some sort of fight along the way and break up and
POD1000000026_S0000260	the idea that we could have a new challenge together potentially i think was what made it way more exciting
POD1000000026_S0000261	i'm not sure we were like looking for personal relationship when we started like a friendship
POD1000000026_S0000262	but the bond we have now is
POD1000000026_S0000264	i think i'd liken to people who like were in the military together
POD1000000026_S0000265	and i'm not like saying were we did anything even close to as important as that but when you go through things with someone when people try to kill your company when people try to throw you under the bus
POD1000000026_S0000266	all this stuff has happened to us and then some
POD1000000026_S0000267	and i remember very specifically this moment we ah we're having a disagreement with an investor
POD1000000026_S0000268	and we were so stressed out and we went to this really terrible taqueria on market street
POD1000000026_S0000269	but we sat down and we both ordered like the greasiest thing we could possibly imagine
POD1000000026_S0000270	and honestly that might have been a low in the company but it was a high for me
POD1000000026_S0000271	like i look back on that moment really fondly because it was us against the world
POD1000000026_S0000272	it was like we're gonna win this thing even if people don't believe in us even if we're having this thing go on like we're gonna make this work
POD1000000026_S0000273	call it friendship but that is like a bond that you don't form hanging out
POD1000000026_S0000274	the fact that we still like each other this long i think speaks to like a deeper trust and like real bond
POD1000000026_S0000275	but i think the fact that we liked each other after that first year which was like pure exposure spoke to trust but i think also just the
POD1000000026_S0000276	we have a way about each other that is not one that we find annoying
POD1000000026_S0000277	which sounds trivial but actually when if you're that around somebody for that long for that many days
POD1000000026_S0000278	you haven't showered in three days sometimes and you're eating the same lunch you've eaten every single day like
POD1000000026_S0000279	it's actually really important and hard to screen for in a like you know couple of nights in a coffee shop prototyping
POD1000000026_S0000280	i think that was a regard where we probably got lucky
POD1000000026_S0000281	couldn't have said it better that's exactly it

POD1000000028_S0000017	bela and martha karolyi gave the u s its first superstar mary lou retton its first gold medal and eventually put american gymnasts on top of the medal stand year after year after year

POD1000000028_S0000029	did it come at a price hell yeah
POD1000000028_S0000030	this is heavy medals from thirty for thirty podcasts i'm alyssa roenigk gymnastics has been part of my life in some form for as long as i can remember from watching mary lou on t v at the nineteen eighty-four olympics when i was seven too later being a teenage gymnast obsessing over kim zmeskal's tumbling passes
POD1000000028_S0000031	and for the past fifteen years at e s p n where my reporting partner bonnie ford and i both cover international sports
POD1000000028_S0000032	when i covered my first summer olympic games in beijing in two thousand and eight china was accused of having an underaged gymnast on the team and i was writing about it i'll never forget bela karolyi shouting into my digital recorder about how the chinese coaches had just stolen his playbook
POD1000000028_S0000033	i wish i still had that tape here was bela karolyi not just upset that china had possibly broken the rules but wanting to make sure i knew he deserved credit for recognizing that younger and smaller gymnasts had better chances for gold it was a point he'd been making to reporters for years
POD1000000028_S0000035	as the truth has come to light about the consequences of pinning a nation's hopes on the shoulders of children bela and martha karolyi have come under scrutiny
POD1000000028_S0000036	today breaking news allegations that strike at the heart of a very successful u s olympic sport
POD1000000028_S0000037	one of the worst things we have seen in u s olympic history
POD1000000028_S0000038	their legacy is littered with questions about what they accomplished and how much responsibility they bear for the incredible amount of damage that has been done
POD1000000028_S0000039	claims tonight from a former gymnast who has filed suit against a doctor and legendary coaches bela and martha karolyi
POD1000000028_S0000040	yes this unnamed gymnast accuses the karolyis of turning a blind eye to abuse
POD1000000028_S0000041	but as complicated as their story would become it all started with something simple
POD1000000028_S0000043	it started with perfection
POD1000000028_S0000045	at the nineteen seventy six olympic games in montreal fourteen-year-old nadia comaneci earned the first perfect ten in olympic gymnastics history
POD1000000028_S0000046	and when the judges announced her score the crowd erupted but no one more so than nadia's coach bela karolyi
POD1000000028_S0000047	at thirty three years old bela and martha karolyi were just beginning their career as coaches outside of romania they were unknowns but bela was impossible to miss
POD1000000028_S0000048	especially as the six foot plus coach towered over his four foot eleven eighty-six pound protege
POD1000000028_S0000050	over the course of a single thrilling week nadia became the crowd favorite and an international star as she scored perfect ten after perfect ten
POD1000000028_S0000052	an unbelievable seven perfect tens all together and in the individual all around nadia won the gold medal a first for romania
POD1000000028_S0000053	finally nadia comes up and does her incredible routine that's where the crowd exploded i mean there was explosion explosion of support explosion of love and excitement and i'm looking through the corner of my eyes
POD1000000028_S0000054	and i see the soviet team getting they stuff and they walking out of the arena i said yes yes we got it
POD1000000028_S0000055	finally after decades of dominance a romanian had beaten the soviets
POD1000000028_S0000056	in a way for some people this is the end of a love affair the dethroning of the u s s r gymnastic competition nadia comaneci now takes over the fourteen-year-old sprite of a girl
POD1000000028_S0000057	but for bela karolyi and his wife and coaching partner martha there was something even greater at stake the favor of the romanian government
POD1000000028_S0000060	it was late night on the romanian time so i was watching it with our team doctor and his wife martha's friend and my wife we watched on a black and white t v
POD1000000028_S0000062	my name is geza pozsar that's the hungarian pronunciation in english is like gee za po za so geza pozsar
POD1000000028_S0000063	geza pozsar was the choreographer for the romanian national team
POD1000000028_S0000064	he'd been working with bela and martha for years he'd designed nadia's floor routine and helped her train for this moment but instead of watching from the sidelines with bela and martha he was watching from home because the romanian government wouldn't let him travel to montreal
POD1000000028_S0000065	because i didn't get the visa to go
POD1000000028_S0000066	geza had recently married a french woman and so the government didn't trust him to go to canada and actually return to romania
POD1000000028_S0000068	from his living room in the small town of onesti geza like the rest of romania watched nadia make history
POD1000000028_S0000070	the whole town came out to the street it was like midnight all of them they come out and this was like a carnival in rio you know it was unbelievable first off they get drunk you know that was the first thing but everyone was so happy
POD1000000028_S0000071	and and there was a huge celebration huge
POD1000000028_S0000072	but this moment was bigger than just the party in those small town streets
POD1000000028_S0000073	the whole world was in ecstasy you know
POD1000000028_S0000074	the whole world was in ecstasy that's why nadia's perfect tens and her gold medal were so important they made romania visible a country that suddenly stood out from the rest of the communist bloc
POD1000000028_S0000075	nadia was a lovable figure from a place the western world saw as very grim
POD1000000028_S0000076	nadia was the diamond she was the treasure of romania she was the best product romania ever had nadia put romania on the map after nadia everybody knows that there is the romania
POD1000000028_S0000078	during the cold war sports were a way for nations to assert their power without going to war olympic success equaled national pride for athletes and coaches in romania it meant security and stature it meant not waiting in line for a loaf of bread
POD1000000028_S0000079	people suffer from shortages
POD1000000028_S0000080	brought about by despotism and corruption of the imperial government
POD1000000028_S0000081	and romania at that time was under a very very strict ugly dictatorship and it was a cult of personality
POD1000000028_S0000082	public display of giant portraits of communist leaders
POD1000000028_S0000083	we had to idolize the leader of the country
POD1000000028_S0000084	nadia's win was the ultimate political validation for the country's leader nicolae ceausescu
POD1000000028_S0000085	the pageantry was befitting the crowning of a princess
POD1000000028_S0000086	there was a national celebration the president got very excited
POD1000000028_S0000087	the presentation was made personally by the president of romania nicolae ceausescu
POD1000000028_S0000089	nadia and the karolyis were welcomed home to romania as heroes
POD1000000028_S0000090	they gave us awards you know we got um some bonuses we paid only half of the tax like everybody paid we got fifty percent deduction on our taxes
POD1000000028_S0000091	propaganda is power in a regime like ceausescu's and there was no better propaganda than celebrating and rewarding the success of its olympic champion and the coaches who had brought romania such high honor
POD1000000028_S0000092	nadia was made a hero of the socialist country and she was a hero all decorated
POD1000000028_S0000093	her country honored nadia with its highest award the hero of the socialist labor

POD1000000028_S0000095	nadia and the karolyis were gifted cars their taxes were cut in half as the rest of the country dealt with crushing rations the romanian coaches and their choreographer had meals delivered to them for free
POD1000000028_S0000096	the days of waiting in food lines were over for them
POD1000000028_S0000097	the only thing that they all expected us to do is to win medals
POD1000000028_S0000098	as long as they could keep making romania proud
POD1000000028_S0000100	bela karolyi had always been an athlete but never a gymnast
POD1000000028_S0000101	he was a boxer in the beginning then he became a hammer thrower then he became a handball coach so everything but gymnastics
POD1000000028_S0000102	bela's first experience with gymnastics didn't come until college
POD1000000028_S0000103	i had to pass some gymnastic test which was all difficult to me i was a tall and pretty heavy guy
POD1000000028_S0000104	so it was it was something something to to see me ah swinging on the bars and doing a tumbling which was an unknown sport for me totally unknown before
POD1000000028_S0000105	he was introduced to gymnastics and to one of his classmates martha eross the woman he would marry
POD1000000028_S0000106	i got married and my wife a former gymnast she was a good gymnast though we got married and we went out to teach the gymnastics
POD1000000028_S0000107	martha and bela both majored in physical education with the goal of coaching young kids they wanted to work together and decided to focus on her specialty gymnastics
POD1000000028_S0000108	it was a new experience totally new experience for me i never had the experience to teach young children i didn't know how to to start with them
POD1000000028_S0000109	bela came to the sport not knowing much about gymnastics but that didn't really matter because he was essentially teaching himself the basics of the sport by teaching little kids who didn't know much about gymnastics themselves
POD1000000028_S0000110	that's something geza noticed the first time he saw bela in action
POD1000000028_S0000111	i saw this big guy big guy ah dressed in a blue warmup and some very small little kids who were up almost just up to his hips you know
POD1000000028_S0000112	flipping like they're little fishes in the water you know like little silver fishes tumbling on the floor it was very impressive and i saw this guy with huge hands you know sometimes spotting them and throwing them up in the air and catching them and
POD1000000028_S0000113	oh my god this guy there was something different
POD1000000028_S0000114	it was kind of an ideal match giant bela could easily spot these small kids and help them safely learn new skills his wife martha had the gymnastics know how and credibility
POD1000000028_S0000115	they started to teach very young kids very hard tricks easy to spot them you know
POD1000000028_S0000116	the karolyis refined their system in local gymnasiums for ten years before breaking onto the national stage
POD1000000028_S0000117	after that he ah got in connection with the ah gymnastic federation ah they get lots of help from ah them
POD1000000028_S0000118	bela and martha's approach got results nearly all of the athletes on the romanian olympic team that won the silver medal in nineteen seventy-six had trained with the karolyis
POD1000000028_S0000119	as a group they were noticeably younger and tinier than the gymnasts who had come before them
POD1000000028_S0000120	fourteen-year-old nadia comaneci of romania four feet eleven eighty-six pounds
POD1000000028_S0000121	by comparison the nineteen seventy-two olympic gold medalist was a nineteen-year-old the nineteen sixty-eight gold medalist was twenty-six they'd been through puberty they were taller they had women's bodies
POD1000000028_S0000122	when nadia won gold at fourteen years old it sealed the trend toward child athletes
POD1000000028_S0000123	the youngest ever to win a gold medal in the all around competition
POD1000000028_S0000124	nadia congratulations again and i one thing i wanted to ask she's the youngest girl to win a gold medal at the olympic games where does she go from here what what about nineteen eighty
POD1000000028_S0000127	i'm going to participate at the olympics in moscow and i'm going to try to do better than i did here and learn a lot new things
POD1000000028_S0000128	how many more tens does she expect
POD1000000028_S0000130	as many as possible
POD1000000028_S0000131	congratulations and to your coach bela karolyi
POD1000000028_S0000132	before the nineteen seventy-six games were even over the romanians were focused on repeating and adding to that success and because bela was seen as responsible for nadia
POD1000000028_S0000133	the romanian government put the karolyis in charge of a new national training center in the small industrial town of deva
POD1000000028_S0000134	bela always like to ah work in this type of a small places when he had lots of control
POD1000000028_S0000135	it was isolated that was the point bela liked to keep tabs on the girls
POD1000000028_S0000136	so he knew when the girls went to buy some ice cream or ah he knew because he knew everybody so the girls were under control they could not go and buy food or something without him knowing it
POD1000000028_S0000137	geza had moved to deva with bela and martha to continue as the team's choreographer and dance coach they were working at the pinnacle of romania's centralized system
POD1000000028_S0000138	and there was tremendous pressure to find more nadias
POD1000000028_S0000139	my real full name is ah gertrude emilia eberle
POD1000000028_S0000140	trudi kollar was a gymnast for romania's national team from nineteen seventy-six to nineteen eighty-three she competed under her middle and maiden names emilia eberle
POD1000000028_S0000141	because it sounded more like romanian
POD1000000028_S0000142	by age twelve trudi was the reigning junior national champion
POD1000000028_S0000143	i just got a call at home
POD1000000028_S0000144	it was bela karolyi
POD1000000028_S0000145	i saw nadia on t v and i loved gymnastics and i said i always told my mom my gosh i wish i could train with her but that's never gonna happen and then we get a phone call and i was like i said okay mom let's go
POD1000000028_S0000146	trudi traveled with her mother by train to deva
POD1000000028_S0000147	i was so happy when we got there and i saw bela he was he looked to me like a mountain i was a little tiny girl and he was like big and all smiling and everything
POD1000000028_S0000148	her mother kissed her and placed a half a loaf of bread in a dresser drawer before leaving she told her daughter to please remember to eat
POD1000000028_S0000149	she said okay honey i need to leave now i need to catch a train i said bye mom i gave her a kiss and then bela showed her to the through the hallway to the door
POD1000000028_S0000150	and i was just like oh okay by myself in a room i said okay so where should i put my stuff and the door just suddenly opens ah ah in a scary way and you know just really fast
POD1000000028_S0000151	and bela comes in and he smacked me over the face so hard that i flew on my bed and he opened the drawer where my bread was in and he said if i ever see you again eating anything like this i will kill you
POD1000000028_S0000152	that was my welcome
POD1000000028_S0000154	don't misunderstand the national training center at a drab town called deva is not a concentration camp there are pillow fights and fun and going to school but there's mostly training
POD1000000028_S0000155	and tough training it is this was nadia in her training days with coach karolyi standing by but not catching her is this training or torture and what did the youngsters think about
POD1000000028_S0000156	we've felt watched all the time
POD1000000028_S0000157	gaby geiculescu was thirteen years old when she was recruited to train with trudi and the other olympians in the making
POD1000000028_S0000158	life in deva was one of deprivation beatings and living in constant fear
POD1000000028_S0000159	i tell you what i what i saw when i got there you know two little crackers in the morning it was a little food but it was not enough
POD1000000028_S0000160	i mean i ate toothpaste because i was not able to sleep i was so hungry and i just tell them i need something in my stomach
POD1000000028_S0000161	we were eating leftovers on the street if you find a little apple that it was like half-eaten then you would pick it up
POD1000000028_S0000162	you you fall asleep dreaming about chocolates floating in front of your eyes you fall asleep seeing like fried chicken
POD1000000028_S0000163	especially when you go on the coaches eat to a table next to you and they get like fried chicken and french fries and they eat right next to us and we sit there what we have
POD1000000028_S0000164	a yogurt a plain yogurt and a boiled egg or you have a dry piece of meat that gets stuck in your throat it's so dry
POD1000000028_S0000165	i mean you you go to sleep hungry and with all that training you know training training training and we were given a fist of vitamins or who knows what was that
POD1000000028_S0000166	and we never knew what's gonna happen next and there were times where eleven o'clock at night came and bela came to the dorm and said put your shoes on and let's go start running outside you're fat as pigs
POD1000000028_S0000168	go run rain shine snowing
POD1000000028_S0000169	there was no patience or compassion for injuries at bela's training center
POD1000000028_S0000170	he wanted everything fast quick you know put them back together fast you know if the doctor doesn't didn't follow bela's orders you know they are out
POD1000000028_S0000171	bela fired doctors who didn't follow his orders and the gymnasts knew that complaining about injuries could lead to a beating
POD1000000028_S0000172	one day doing a vault at practice gaby landed awkwardly and broke two fingers she walked back to her teammates and showed them her throbbing right hand
POD1000000028_S0000173	and they told me shut up don't say anything because he's gonna get so mad and i had to finish that practice with two broken fingers
POD1000000028_S0000174	i remember trying to grab the bar with the one one of the hands i couldn't put two fingers down and somehow he just got kind of sick of looking at me not doing a good job
POD1000000028_S0000175	he said few words you know and and just just dismissed me nobody's gonna take me to take an x-ray not have a doctor to look at this
POD1000000028_S0000176	and all what i hear from colleagues is just keep going
POD1000000028_S0000177	everything about the gymnasts lives in deva was monitored the national team coaches listened to their phone calls and intercepted their mail
POD1000000028_S0000178	when homesick girls ran away from the training center police took them back to deva
POD1000000028_S0000179	i was so scared i swear i thought he has eyes on trees and the bushes on the walls
POD1000000028_S0000180	we couldn't quit it was not a choice and you had to keep going against your will against everything
POD1000000028_S0000181	bela maintained complete control while martha came into the gym mostly to coach balance beam
POD1000000028_S0000182	to me it always seemed like he was always on top of everything and she was doing whatever he wanted her to do and obeying everything
POD1000000028_S0000183	when martha was in the gym she could also be physically abusive
POD1000000028_S0000184	and we could actually defend ourselves from her because she was not strong enough to catch us and hit us
POD1000000028_S0000185	so you know something like she was scratch us or and she would grab us from the neck like this and then she would pull her fingernails into your meat and it kinda hurt but she was she was not good at beating
POD1000000028_S0000186	bela was the bad one oh gosh that was bad
POD1000000028_S0000187	and when they faltered at meets they faced his wrath
POD1000000028_S0000188	let's say on beam you fell on beam that was a disaster you got off the beam saluted the judges and we went straight to the bathroom and he came after us and we got beaten up
POD1000000028_S0000190	and then he said well you better pull yourself together because you have two more events
POD1000000028_S0000191	the girls only respite from bela and martha was their dance classes with geza
POD1000000028_S0000192	you know it was relaxing for us it was fun he could ah make us you know smile and have a good time
POD1000000028_S0000193	they also knew he would look out for them
POD1000000028_S0000194	geza was always the one that was always behind bela's back he was protecting us
POD1000000028_S0000195	when he was together with bela and martha he was a tough guy because he had to look like a tough guy because he would have probably lost his job if he didn't
POD1000000028_S0000196	so every time we went to practice at the gym in the afternoon and geza was there before and he was always at the door looking through the keyhole and when bela and martha coming he said six six six and five five was martha and six was bela
POD1000000028_S0000197	geza used dance counts as code names for martha and bela
POD1000000028_S0000198	that's how we knew when he said six we already were like oh my gosh bela's coming
POD1000000028_S0000199	some days bela disappeared from the gym to go hunting
POD1000000028_S0000200	those are the best days of our lives in the gym so basically dracula wasn't there
POD1000000028_S0000201	who was dracula
POD1000000028_S0000202	oh bela
POD1000000028_S0000204	bela and martha faced enormous pressure going into the nineteen eighty olympics their standing with the government was only as good as their next result
POD1000000028_S0000205	they'd have to match or beat the success of the seventy-six games to keep their country's favor
POD1000000028_S0000206	the entire romanian team felt the weight of their country's oppressive regime when they met with officials before they left for moscow
POD1000000028_S0000207	some kind of lieutenant i don't know he was all dressed in green and stuff big and big guy and really serious and he said you better think what you're doing twice don't you ever bring shame on your country you're wearing our country on your shoulders
POD1000000028_S0000208	trying to defend her gold medal in the all-around nadia became the center of a judging dispute
POD1000000028_S0000210	nadia went on a beam and her beam score didn't come up
POD1000000028_S0000212	bela protested nadia's low beam score in full view of the television cameras
POD1000000028_S0000214	nadia had to settle for the silver in the all-around but went on to win gold on floor and beam trudi won a silver medal on the uneven bars
POD1000000028_S0000215	the romanians repeated with a silver in the team competition but this time finishing second to the russians was a disappointment bela and martha weren't returning to romania as heroes again
POD1000000028_S0000216	so when we made a big brouhaha about nadia's scoring on beam the government didn't like it
POD1000000028_S0000217	in a society hyper-sensitive about how it was perceived on the world stage and particularly by its communist allies bela's protest in response to the russian judge embarrassed the romanian officials
POD1000000028_S0000218	plus his most important ally in the ceausescu regime
POD1000000028_S0000219	had just been demoted
POD1000000028_S0000220	so ah bela knew that the end is close and then he told me at that moment we are now in big trouble and from there everything started to go sour for us
POD1000000028_S0000222	the first time i ever saw bela karolyi in action with his gymnasts was pretty memorable
POD1000000028_S0000224	it was the nadia eighty-one tour when bela and the romanian women's national team toured with the american team in march nineteen eighty-one
POD1000000028_S0000225	my reporting partner bonnie ford covered the detroit stop of the nadia eighty-one tour a seven-city promotional tour of the u s featuring the romanian national team and its superstar
POD1000000028_S0000226	so i personally as both an olympic fan and a reporter at that time i didn't think of it as a political event where the romanians were showing off their system so to speak
POD1000000028_S0000227	certainly they did they saw it as a propaganda tool and a chance to highlight their excellence
POD1000000028_S0000229	but to me it was just a chance to see the best athlete in her sport
POD1000000028_S0000231	i was focused on nadia the audience was focused on nadia a lot of you know very excited young girls this was like beatlemania nadia mania was definitely a real thing
POD1000000028_S0000233	bela karolyi was very visible and he was unmistakable on the floor huge guy he was in our eyes the guru the genius behind nadia's precision and and perfection
POD1000000028_S0000234	being on tour with bela as the romanian's coach it was interesting to watch him and the gymnasts really just how they interacted with each other
POD1000000028_S0000235	the u s national team had been invited to perform with the romanians on their tour tracee talavera was a member of that team
POD1000000028_S0000236	the gymnasts were always very stern very robotic they worked extremely hard they did numbers of routines and skills way beyond what we had ever seen
POD1000000028_S0000237	mike jacki the man who would become the president of the u s gymnastics federation was on the tour working for one of the equipment sponsors he had a front row seat to the karolyis
POD1000000028_S0000238	martha was in the background she didn't say anything bela instructed her like he instructed everybody else she was very subservient i mean it it was not a coaching duo
POD1000000028_S0000239	you know he was definitely the coach and she was definitely the third assistant even though there wasn't a first or second assistant
POD1000000028_S0000240	but despite how well the tour was going things behind the scenes were deteriorating for the romanian coaches
POD1000000028_S0000241	they could tell from the way officials were treating them that they were in danger of losing their jobs and their prestige
POD1000000028_S0000242	we were done then we were treated very poorly from the very beginning of the tour i mean the president of the gymnastics federation was very gave us a cold shoulder
POD1000000028_S0000243	on the washington d c stop they were invited to a dinner party hosted by the romanian ambassador
POD1000000028_S0000244	and at the dinner party nobody would talk to us they look at us like strangers like not even part of the team i think we had a feeling that there's something was going on
POD1000000028_S0000245	bela said that i don't know if we have any future back in romania
POD1000000028_S0000246	the tour was almost over in two days they'd be headed home the karolyis and geza knew things could only get worse for them that their favor with a fickle and punitive government was waning
POD1000000028_S0000247	they were tired of the scrutiny in romania everyone was watched all the time bela had fantasized about what a life in the united states could be
POD1000000028_S0000248	they had to make a decision
POD1000000028_S0000249	we made a plan
POD1000000028_S0000250	after the final show the team returned to new york before traveling back to romania but the coaches had no intention of getting on that plane
POD1000000028_S0000251	martha had an aunt with a place in manhattan that they could use to hideout for a few days in order to get there geza would have to distract his roommate the head of the romanian security detail
POD1000000028_S0000252	the plan was that i will take the secret service guy out to ah shopping and then we meet at the apartment
POD1000000028_S0000254	the morning of march thirty at nineteen eighty-one trudi and her teammates were told they could go shopping as long as they were back in time to board a bus to j f k airport at noon
POD1000000028_S0000255	so we had a little bit of money and we met down at in the hallway and they said okay so you have two hours no funny business no chocolates no eating no nothing
POD1000000028_S0000256	then we all went out the door probably i walked like ten steps and bela says trudi
POD1000000028_S0000257	i need you to come back i started crying i said oh my gosh what have i done wrong this time he said you're gonna have to come back with us in our room i started crying because i thought you know i i mean just the fear of what have i done wrong
POD1000000028_S0000258	trudi followed bela's orders and went back to their room with martha
POD1000000028_S0000259	i go back with martha to the hotel room and very unusual behavior she went looked at the the the window when walked back to the door looked to the window walked back to the door i talked to myself what in the world gosh in my head now i'm supposed to be waiting to get beaten up
POD1000000028_S0000260	and i think we waited a good half an hour and then he comes through the door with a this kind of look on his face his face like he was all pale and stuff like that he says trudi we're not coming back anymore
POD1000000028_S0000261	when i heard that i asked what that's the first time that i i talked and i said what is that well we decided that we're gonna stay here we're not coming back
POD1000000028_S0000262	bela and martha asked trudi to bring back luggage for their families
POD1000000028_S0000263	and then they just told me said um we just have one request please make sure that we're gonna leave this room you don't leave this room for about ten minutes after we're out of this room
POD1000000028_S0000264	and you cannot tell anybody anything until you get on the plane they left and i looked out in the windows and i saw them throwing the luggage into a taxi they jumped in taxi and left
POD1000000028_S0000265	and that's when i knew for sure i said oh we really we really got rid of the dracula we're not going to get beaten ever again life is gonna be good from now on
POD1000000028_S0000266	meanwhile geza got his security guard roommate out of the hotel and into the crowded streets of times square for their own shopping trip
POD1000000028_S0000267	it's a big sale big sale i think they had a feeling that something was going on we had some plans yeah and he would not let me go and suddenly he sees a little store with umbrellas
POD1000000028_S0000268	geza had his opportunity
POD1000000028_S0000269	i saw a cab you know stopping down the street i jumped in the cab and i was gone
POD1000000028_S0000270	geza made his way to meet bela and martha at her aunt's apartment
POD1000000028_S0000271	and when they saw me they jumped up and down that i had made it they were very happy
POD1000000028_S0000272	after trudi saw the karolyis leave she went out and found her teammates on their shopping expedition and loaded up on chocolate

POD1000000030_S0000001	if it saves energy and gives you performance a boost well when is a shoe just a shoe from american public media this is marketplace tech demystifying the digital economy i'm jack stewart in for molly wood
POD1000000030_S0000003	world athletics the governing body for track and field is set to announce whether it'll ban certain types of shoes
POD1000000030_S0000004	in particular nike's vaporfly shoes have been prominently on the feet of athletes responsible for tumbling race records recently
POD1000000030_S0000005	nike claims the two hundred and fifty dollars sneakers shave up to four percent off a runner's time so is that technology doping
POD1000000030_S0000006	we got hold of iain hunter professor of exercise science at brigham young university as he was with athletes training at b y u's indoor track he told us the shoes work by combining foam in the sole with a carbon fiber plate
POD1000000030_S0000007	i think the plate mostly allows for some structure of the shoes
POD1000000030_S0000008	so if that plate wasn't there and you have a forty-four millimeter height off the ground that's just foam and you try running around the corner that's just gonna collapse on you
POD1000000030_S0000009	so that the plate
POD1000000030_S0000011	mainly give structure to the shoe but it does give a small benefit in terms of energy cost
POD1000000030_S0000012	combine that with now you can do higher foam because you can hold everything together with the plate
POD1000000030_S0000013	and you've got a really good pushing into the ground a big displacement of the foot while it interacts with the ground and then pushes off really effectively
POD1000000030_S0000014	so it quite literally puts a spring in your step
POD1000000030_S0000015	yeah it it's not a coiled spring like we're used to but any foam is really a spring this one's just really effective at it
POD1000000030_S0000016	but where's the line that's what the question is now and i think these are either at the line where i'd feel comfortable or a little bit beyond
POD1000000030_S0000017	so you're saying that there could still so be some innovation allowed in shoes we're not going to say everybody must wear the same type of shoe but there must be a limit to it
POD1000000030_S0000018	yeah i i think it's wonderful to have the innovation on what nike has done as ah propel to other companies to catch up and they will catch up
POD1000000030_S0000019	so we could have the standard for marathoning or a road racing as a shoe like the vaporfly but then nike or someone will go a little further with it
POD1000000030_S0000020	and we'll end up with like sixteen millimeter foam and enough carbon fiber to hold the structure of it so you're not collapsing but it will just continue on
POD1000000030_S0000021	and the at some point the rules need to just standardize here's what a shoe is
POD1000000030_S0000022	the price of these shoes to us amateurs out there ah it seems incredibly high is it sort of what you would expect for a top-of-the-line running shoe
POD1000000030_S0000023	yeah when they say two hundred and fifty dollars for a pair of shoes that nike has mentioned probably will last year about ninety miles before it's losing some of its effectiveness
POD1000000030_S0000024	that is getting to the point of not outrageous but people are going to be restricted by the cost of that and they'll be looking for cheaper options
POD1000000030_S0000025	if new balance saucony others start competing with the same quality and performance of shoe and are charging a hundred and fifty nike is gonna have to start dropping their costs down
POD1000000030_S0000026	so i just the natural how marketing works and and it'll all come to an equilibrium over time
POD1000000030_S0000027	i remember reading about the advantages that some forms of artificial legs could give runners potentially over runners with like natural-born legs i mean are are we just reaching a point where kind of sport is hard engineering
POD1000000030_S0000028	it is and and i think it should be but there have to be some restrictions to how far you go
POD1000000030_S0000029	and we we don't want people to be tempted to amputate their lower legs so they can go from a two fifteen marathoner to a two o five marathoner
POD1000000030_S0000030	our legs aren't built just for running they're built for climbing and swimming and jumping and all kinds of activities
POD1000000030_S0000031	so if you tune the leg to be tuned just for running they'll be great at running but not good at other things
POD1000000030_S0000032	and that that's where you could go if you didn't have rules established
POD1000000030_S0000033	given that these shoes do kind of have a limited life do do athletes train in them and actually run in them in races or do you sort of hold them off for that that performance boost when you really need it
POD1000000030_S0000034	well if they're sponsored by nike they'll do all of their race pace work in those shoes
POD1000000030_S0000035	but if they're buying their own shoes what i typically see is they buy the pair do maybe two workouts in them before the race so they probably have about fifteen to twenty miles on them and then they do the race
POD1000000030_S0000036	and then they'll maybe workout in those ones but buy a new pair before the next race they do
POD1000000030_S0000037	and that's if it's someone that cares about saving a couple minutes on a marathon time
POD1000000030_S0000038	i i think it's somewhere around one or two minutes the benefit that most would get from this shoe
POD1000000030_S0000039	the price of progress i guess iain hunter that he works with u s a track and field
POD1000000030_S0000041	and now with some related links nike's shoes first came to prominence in twenty sixteen when they were worn by the first three finishers in the rio olympics men's marathon
POD1000000030_S0000042	an estimated ninety-five of the first one hundred finishers in last year's valencia marathon were wearing vaporfly shoes
POD1000000030_S0000043	that's just two of the statistics that reuters has pulled together to show the dominance of this tech in various different versions some graphs in there article too from my fellow data nerds
POD1000000030_S0000044	i also got lost in the new wall street journal video on the shoes and the controversy around them which as it says some are calling a seismic shift
POD1000000030_S0000045	so we'll link you to that and a voice you hear on marketplace tech from time to time nick thompson editor in chief of wired magazine is also a keen marathoner
POD1000000030_S0000046	and he set out to put these sneakers to the test himself by running the new york marathon wearing them and crunching all of his data
POD1000000030_S0000047	they felt strange and wobbly at first he says my initial steps reminded me of putting on ice skates and then walking on a rubber mat to the rink
POD1000000030_S0000048	but once i started running the strangeness disappeared and i forgot i was wearing them
POD1000000030_S0000049	more of his experiences and his crunching of the scientific data to see if he experienced the tech of doping effect at marketplace tech dot org
POD1000000030_S0000050	i'm jack stewart and that is marketplace tech
POD1000000030_S0000052	this is a p m
POD1000000031_S0000001	the holidays are over it's back to reality for most of us and back to some distant warehouse for a lot of are unwanted gifts
POD1000000031_S0000002	from american public media this is marketplace tech demystifying the digital economy
POD1000000031_S0000003	i'm jack steward and for molly wood
POD1000000031_S0000005	this season's online holiday sales were worth some one hundred and thirty-eight billion dollars to e-retailers
POD1000000031_S0000006	but nearly a third of that stuff is expected to be returned according to new research from c b r e a real estate research group
POD1000000031_S0000007	and that's pretty typical thirty percent of online shopping is returned versus eight percent of stuff bought in shops
POD1000000031_S0000008	and all of those returns come with a cost even if that free to us the shoppers
POD1000000031_S0000009	there's the emission from the trucks and planes the waste from packaging and discarded products the cost of finding space for it all or even just checking it out
POD1000000031_S0000010	david egan with c b r e says right about now warehouse workers are getting buried
POD1000000031_S0000011	well it's just the flood of packages when you when you think about the way the supply chain is built and designed it really is meant to be as efficient as possible in moving product from the point of production to wherever something is made to the end point the point of consumption
POD1000000031_S0000012	and all of the networks the the the buildings the flow through the buildings the transportation networks even the way the employees are trained to handle the packages are really meant to get that stuff moving out as quickly as possible
POD1000000031_S0000013	are there ways that we could use technology to try to mitigate this problem
POD1000000031_S0000014	in my opinion the real solution is going to be a technological solution at the point of sale so how do you provide the customer better assurance that what they're buying is what they actually want
POD1000000031_S0000015	so the classic example is someone buys three or four shirts with the intention of only keeping one or two of them because they don't know if the size is right they don't know the colors quite can be right they don't know what it's gonna feel like
POD1000000031_S0000016	and i do think there are technologies between augmented reality and virtual reality where we'll be able to shop online and have a more a a sense of an in-person type of experience which i believe will really substantially reduce the number of returns that occur
POD1000000031_S0000017	the other side of it though is that offering that type of free frictionless seamless return policy is really important to keeping customers
POD1000000031_S0000018	do you think we as consumers have a role to play here i mean returns are so easy most of the time that free there're maybe something we don't even think about as much as we should
POD1000000031_S0000019	i think we need to incur some of the cost frankly i do think that the free and painless return system that we've all been accustomed to dealing with is long-term not sustainable
POD1000000031_S0000020	so i do think at some place we need to understand how damaging it is not only to the the retailers that we're we're doing business with but also to the environment
POD1000000031_S0000021	you know one fact that i find shocking frankly is that in the united states alone five billion pounds of return merchandise gets put in the landfill every single year just in the u s
POD1000000031_S0000022	so merchandise that's been handled and enough time has passed between the point of sale to the the return point that has been deemed worthless and it gets thrown away five billion pounds a year
POD1000000031_S0000023	so i mean that it it's just it's it's a destructive type of type of system that we're all taking part in and i think we all need to do our part to make it go away
POD1000000031_S0000024	and one of the ways to do that is to pay for it and when people are asked to pay for something they will be a lot more careful about the way they behave
POD1000000031_S0000025	now the flip side of that is that the consumers have voted overwhelmingly in favor of free and frictionless returns and have said that they will find someone if if you won't give it to me someone else will
POD1000000031_S0000026	so fixing this is not going to be easy it's really hard to imagine the first retailer that's going to be brave enough to turn around and say sure we'll take your returns but it's actually gonna cost you
POD1000000031_S0000027	that was david egan with c b r e
POD1000000031_S0000029	and now for some related links
POD1000000031_S0000030	it's impossible to talk about online shopping without mentioning the behemoth that is amazon as adweek says where it goes other retailers follow
POD1000000031_S0000031	and in the last decade it has set new standards and expectations for delivery pushing its competitors to do the same
POD1000000031_S0000032	adweek has the five ways which amazon changed shopping in the twenty tens
POD1000000031_S0000033	with returns often being free it's really not surprising that consumers aren't aware of the real costs
POD1000000031_S0000034	or maybe we just like to assume or hope that those unwanted items that we so carefully return with all their original packages intact are then restocked and resold
POD1000000031_S0000035	the idea that a good chunk of them end up in landfills is well as the ali times calls it a hidden environmental crisis
POD1000000031_S0000036	david egan explained that the logistics operation is set up to run smoothly in one direction getting things to us
POD1000000031_S0000037	there are a lot of efforts to streamline the opposite direction too though there are companies making it that business to help retailers and consumers
POD1000000031_S0000038	so if you do ever step out from behind your computer and actually go to malls a little more frequently than me you've probably noticed some return bars where you can drop off purchases and have someone else just deal with all that sending it back stuff for you
POD1000000031_S0000039	and for the sellers these companies promise to analyze returns and the reasons for them and reduce the packaging they need vogue business breaks it down
POD1000000031_S0000040	but i think really the new year's resolution that i'm taking away from all of this is just to buy less stuff i'm jack steward and that's marketplace tech
POD1000000031_S0000042	this is a p m
POD1000000031_S0000043	hello to twenty-twenty and to all the new marketplace investors who joined us before the end of the decade

POD1000000032_S0000001	the u s needs a lot more hospital beds fast
POD1000000032_S0000002	can tech help us build them
POD1000000032_S0000003	from american public media this is marketplace tech demystifying the digital economy
POD1000000032_S0000004	i'm molly wood
POD1000000032_S0000006	states and cities are rushing to find hospital beds to prepare for an increase in patients suffering from covid-nineteen
POD1000000032_S0000007	in new york makeshift hospitals are going up in central park and a navy hospital ship is in the city's harbor
POD1000000032_S0000008	its javits convention center has been converted into a temporary medical facility and the u s army corps of engineers is looking to convert empty hotels and other buildings into hospitals across the country
POD1000000032_S0000009	now as part of its response to the coronavirus the chinese government built two giant hospitals in ten days
POD1000000032_S0000010	and we wondered could we build hospitals that fast here in the u s and what tech exists to innovate on the construction process
POD1000000032_S0000011	chris giattina is working on it he's the c e o of the manufacturing and design firm blox which specializes in modular medical facility construction
POD1000000032_S0000012	we deliver acute care facilities think about hospitals and we design them digitally and and we manufacture them in our plan
POD1000000032_S0000013	imagine a a big complex lego that we can ship out and then when we ah when we when we get there we assemble it as a completed building
POD1000000032_S0000014	and and all of this relies on a bunch of technology that we use the the the digital design and the supply chain and the machines that make these parts real together
POD1000000032_S0000015	but but at the end we take raw material and we turn it into hospitals
POD1000000032_S0000016	and about how long does that take
POD1000000032_S0000017	yeah typical building may take twelve to sixteen months to make
POD1000000032_S0000018	and and we do it in four months now and every day we're you know we have a team that's working to make it faster and faster
POD1000000032_S0000019	yeah you know i asked that because no pressure but it seems as though we are going to need some health care facilities quickly
POD1000000032_S0000020	how do you how do you see you know your company being a part of that
POD1000000032_S0000021	so a few weeks ago when the size of this pandemic became clear
POD1000000032_S0000022	our team had to refocus on we were making permanent hospitals and we were doing them really fast but we had to think about how to take this problem um and put it through our machine blox
POD1000000032_S0000023	and figure out how to do that so that we could get hospital beds quicker
POD1000000032_S0000024	we set out immediately to design a twenty-four bed micu
POD1000000032_S0000025	um ah
POD1000000032_S0000026	a micu is a it's a mobile isolation care unit this micu it it's got three jobs
POD1000000032_S0000027	and the first one it's it's got ah protect the front-line health care workers
POD1000000032_S0000028	and and then there's this the second thing that they've got to do which is they they're designed to protect the hospital's existing capacity
POD1000000032_S0000029	and and then the final one is we're trying to make these micus ah become a permanent and flexible asset that that that helps serve the health system go on forwards
POD1000000032_S0000030	so i mean they're institutional grade they're reusable
POD1000000032_S0000031	it's a it's a fleet of i c u rooms that gets to be moved in the future to wherever the hot spot is
POD1000000032_S0000032	how much do they cost
POD1000000032_S0000033	these things will be around two to three hundred thousand dollars a bed ah in the beginning and then those those prices will drop down
POD1000000032_S0000034	so these are significantly less expensive but they're still high-tech ah devices that are chock full of equipment and pressurization and electronics and they're still pretty expensive boxes
POD1000000032_S0000035	can you tell us at all where these projects might be happening like where you're putting up these micus
POD1000000032_S0000036	well we're we're we're not putting them up yet um so it's still it's still going to production in two weeks
POD1000000032_S0000037	um the first ones could be in any of the spots that are needed
POD1000000032_S0000038	so um obviously we've been in ah pretty heavy discussions in new york we've been in discussions ah in in georgia and there's a big ah there's a big delta between there's two places but it really doesn't matter to us where they're needed
POD1000000032_S0000039	they can go just as easily to one or the other
POD1000000032_S0000040	and then just out of curiosity is it sort of like a modular house where it's basically sort of pre-built and then it just comes on a big truck
POD1000000032_S0000041	you know it it parts of it are so ah ah a lego analogy is really a pretty good one
POD1000000032_S0000042	if you think about a lego kit or advanced one um it has it has different types of parts
POD1000000032_S0000043	some of them are volumetric and some of them are um are are custom parts and some of them are little pieces that can be used in a thousand different different ways
POD1000000032_S0000044	and and we're agnostic about it we think that there's just a a value stream that goes from raw material and it's converted into a usable building
POD1000000032_S0000045	and and the process that it goes through is a whole lot of different stages
POD1000000032_S0000046	we're just trying to find an optimal one
POD1000000032_S0000047	there's not always a right path because of ah but in in fact we're using many of the things that we do for regular hospitals right now
POD1000000032_S0000048	but we've we've made different changes the foundation for example is significantly different on a micu
POD1000000032_S0000049	it doesn't need all of the permanence that that a acute care hospital may have a that you know that has a fifty-year lifespan
POD1000000032_S0000050	so so the the idea is we we think of it as completed parts but every part's completed
POD1000000032_S0000051	and it goes together in a form of chunking
POD1000000032_S0000052	and it's kind of the way they build a new boeing seven eighty-seven dreamliner it's not made on an assembly line the way you you know you think of an assembly line
POD1000000032_S0000053	it's it's made in chunks that are made all over the world and they've all brought together charles and put together as an oh yeah in in a matter of days
POD1000000032_S0000054	so that's more like what we're doing with with blox
POD1000000032_S0000055	got it what makes these specific to medical facilities
POD1000000032_S0000056	what kind of certification and technology goes into that
POD1000000032_S0000057	the hospitals are really heavily regulated
POD1000000032_S0000058	and and if you if you try and understand which ones there are you it's it's it's a long list
POD1000000032_S0000059	and so what i would just simply say is um um these things are dealing with life safety at an institutional level they're dealing with emergency power critical care um operations
POD1000000032_S0000060	they're dealing with temperature control that's based on air exchanges which allow you to evacuate ah disease and infection
POD1000000032_S0000061	they are designed to be visible and operational high performances if you will
POD1000000032_S0000062	right so these these nurses and doctors are under enormous amount of pressure
POD1000000032_S0000063	and what you're trying to do is create a a place which is safe for them to work but visually ah controlled so they can see everything at once
POD1000000032_S0000064	and you know that's what we focused on we how we make this really a beautiful ah elegantly simple operationally visually controlled device that is technologically empowered
POD1000000032_S0000065	and can be deployed really fast and still be done with the stuff that's available today not the stuff that we wish was available today
POD1000000032_S0000066	you said that you're trying to take a typical construction time for a building from twelve to eighteen months down to four months
POD1000000032_S0000067	how long will it take to construct these micus
POD1000000032_S0000068	so the the first one will roll off in june the the end of may and it'll be operational a week later
POD1000000032_S0000069	and then after that they'll just keep coming as long as they're needed
POD1000000032_S0000070	so once the line is loaded then think of it as just a continuous river that keeps dropping them out
POD1000000032_S0000071	so there's about ten large modules in each one of these and every day and a half another ten will be ready to be shipped
POD1000000032_S0000072	let me ask you this it's clearly a technological miracle in a lot of ways
POD1000000032_S0000073	june is a long ways away do you wish that you had started getting called sooner
POD1000000032_S0000075	yes necessity is the mother of invention and i think that we're as a nation in the midst of a necessity
POD1000000032_S0000076	i like what i see in terms of the human spirit coming together to try and solve hard problems right now
POD1000000032_S0000077	chris giattina is c e o of the modular medical facility construction firm blox
POD1000000032_S0000078	he said the company is talking right now with a few states about building the micus he mentioned
POD1000000032_S0000079	but so far hasn't finalize any deals
POD1000000032_S0000081	and now for some related links to that point about whether blox is already building facilities
POD1000000032_S0000082	fast company has a piece on how yes we have the technology and the modular construction expertise to get buildings up quickly
POD1000000032_S0000083	but we also have a lot of logistics and red-tape problems
POD1000000032_S0000084	the army corps of engineers as you heard wants to convert existing facilities
POD1000000032_S0000085	but for the reasons that giattina mentioned a hotel or convention center is not ideal for the job those buildings are hard to sterilize
POD1000000032_S0000086	they need h vac systems that can prevent infectious diseases from being pumped into every room and they have plenty of other medical needs as well
POD1000000032_S0000087	the piece points to some modular design companies that are creating medical pods that can be built quickly
POD1000000032_S0000088	some others in addition to blox
POD1000000032_S0000089	but since each city and state has its own rules around construction and permits and even just a shortage of actual land to put modules on
POD1000000032_S0000090	it's a tough problem to solve quickly at a time when speed is what we need
POD1000000032_S0000092	and here is what else we're watching in tech
POD1000000032_S0000093	the wall street journal reports that no surprise the u s is already starting to track people's smartphone data to analyze movements and ultimately build a database that can show at a national level
POD1000000032_S0000094	how well social distancing measures are working and where people might be gathering together in large groups so that authorities can both crack down and potentially predict a future outbreak
POD1000000032_S0000095	and look we're gonna talk a lot more about this later in the week this need for a data-driven response to this outbreak and the fact that this is useful existing data
POD1000000032_S0000096	and the fact that it is also likely to become a privacy invasion at a grand scale
POD1000000032_S0000097	techcrunch has a piece about how singapore is collecting data in a more privacy-friendly way through an app called tracetogether
POD1000000032_S0000098	that's what m i t is trying to do with its app safe paths but both cases rely on people downloading the app and using it and voluntarily reporting information
POD1000000032_S0000099	in singapore there is a more central authority that can you know make people do the thing
POD1000000032_S0000100	that's a lot harder in the u s and since the data already exists in one giant cookie jar full of delicious quarantine baked cookies
POD1000000032_S0000101	it's gonna be real hard to convince the cookie monster to find another treat
POD1000000032_S0000102	i'm molly wood and that's marketplace tech

POD1000000034_S0000004	how amazon has become a big part of this covid nineteen life and in more ways than you might think from american public media this is marketplace tech demystifying the digital economy
POD1000000034_S0000005	i'm kimberly adams and from molly wood
POD1000000034_S0000007	as we continue to deal with the coronavirus outbreak many of us are doing more online shopping and relying on amazon more than ever amazon has hired about eighty thousand new workers to keep up with the demand
POD1000000034_S0000008	and following employee walk out since protests the company announced thursday it would start taking employees temperatures at work and provide face masks
POD1000000034_S0000009	amazon in the era of covid-nineteen is the topic for this weeks quality assurance where we take a second look at the big story in the news matt day covers amazon from bloomberg
POD1000000034_S0000010	and we talked about whither the company fit into that now crucial designation of essential
POD1000000034_S0000011	obviously a good deal of amazon is kind of essential in this times and particularly if you're somebody with mobility issues you're somebody who for for health reasons doesn't want to even take the risk going to ah going to a supermarket or big-box store that remains open yeah you you are relying on e-comers and
POD1000000034_S0000012	you know on on that regard if you are trying to get drug user or hand sanitizer or wipes chances are using amazon dot com but one of the drawbacks that we found of this environment lists if you talked to amazon's workers is that they are still shipping a lot of non-essential stuff
POD1000000034_S0000013	amazon's digital door remain open for for books for you know toys games for kinda everything else they have been sale online anyway they are still shipping them and there're workers in facilities around the country you know still risking their own health going in to work
POD1000000034_S0000014	um and the service of moving those goods to your door too
POD1000000034_S0000015	we are talking about e-commerce but amazon also has a lot of other business right
POD1000000034_S0000016	right right and there is just a bunch of other areas that you know they stand to to likely benefits from this you know one of them it doesn't get talked about quite as much as as delivery but ah amazon web services their cloud computing group which you know is essentially on-demand software or or or processing power
POD1000000034_S0000017	you know businesses with employees working from home are ah are making more use of that ah analysts say and then you know if you're sitting at home watching netflix or using a variety of internet services a lot of the backbones of of those ah live on amazon web services and so
POD1000000034_S0000018	you know this is kind of the conventional wisdom that they stand to gain ah too from this ah this environment right now
POD1000000034_S0000019	you know so many of our conversations are about what happens after we come out of this even though it's hard to even envision when that is or or what the world is gonna look like at that point
POD1000000034_S0000020	but when we look at amazon a a year from now what kind of stories do you think you'll be writing about this company and and its business
POD1000000034_S0000021	i think we're gonna be writing about you know how this you know as as catastrophic are gonna been as it's putting to be globally um this is the kind of the thing that amazon was built for you know they've spent most of the last decade building a a giant logistics network in the u s and and parts of europe to
POD1000000034_S0000022	really in an unprecedented way get goods to you quicker um to to every doorstep they can access they've been you know touting e-commerce since that term was new um so i think in a lot of ways their company built to take advantage of this
POD1000000034_S0000023	and now it hasn't been a a glorious couple of months for them they've had some complaints from workers about you know nonessential goods and the rate at which they've been worked there's been you know the the usual criticisms from u s senators about giving ah workers better pay
POD1000000034_S0000024	which has been an issue at amazon um often on for a while you know but but to a large extent this company was designed to handle these kind of challenges so i think you know if this indeed means a a sort of permanent increase in online commerce you know amazon would stand ah stand to gain a tremendous amount from it
POD1000000034_S0000025	another question is just whether they're able to capitalize on that you know the way their business leaders would hope or if some of the the p r backlash related to some of these controversies ah hampers them
POD1000000034_S0000026	we have seen protests this week by delivery workers and people working in amazon's warehouses will this have an effect on the company's operations
POD1000000034_S0000027	the the issue with amazon it's it's been a complicated story for a long time but one of the things this crisis is doing is some of those folks are kind of taking an opportunity to speak in a way that they haven't before there was a a walkout in an amazon warehouse just outside of detroit
POD1000000034_S0000028	it was the third um you know walkout in three days at an amazon facility you know across the country and that's just something you don't see very often
POD1000000034_S0000029	you know so clearly you know workers who feel under extreme amounts of pressure themselves um think that this is an opportunity for them to you know maybe ask things of management that would have been um more difficult under this sort of business as usual conditions
POD1000000034_S0000030	bloomberg's mat day amazon also says that's no longer going to sell n-ninety-five masks and other urgently needed covid nineteen related supplies to regular customers
POD1000000034_S0000031	the company has a new section of its website just for these products and says it will prioritize them for hospitals and government agencies
POD1000000034_S0000033	and now for some related links matt day recently wrote about amazon surging and hiring to meet all the demand from people stuck at home due to coronavirus
POD1000000034_S0000034	and some of that hiring last month was happening at job fairs where people weren't exactly able to practice social distancing
POD1000000034_S0000035	amazon said it's since updated its recruiting strategies too according to math reports keep applicants safe
POD1000000034_S0000037	and my colleague andy uhler covered those amazon protests we were talking about
POD1000000034_S0000038	and speaking of safety instacart says it's going to start providing full service shoppers with a safety kit including a mask hands sanitizer and a thermometer
POD1000000034_S0000039	shoppers have to request the kits but they are supposed to be free you can find the links to all the stories at market place dot org
POD1000000034_S0000041	and here is what else for watching after years of negotiations a bunch of lawsuits a department of justice investigation millions of dollars in lobbying and some extra stays at the trump hotel
POD1000000034_S0000042	the merger between t-mobile and sprint is finally done that deal is worth about twenty-six billion dollars and leaves us with just three big wireless networks a t and t verizon and t-mobile and no one else
POD1000000034_S0000043	stephanie hughes produces marketplace tech kasuses avroato is our assistant producer jodie baker is our senior editor and robyn edgar is our engineer i'm kimberily adams and that's marketplace tech
POD1000000034_S0000045	this is a p m
POD1000000035_S0000001	huge number of people signing up for unemployment are exposing an infrastructure problem in the states
POD1000000035_S0000002	really really old technology
POD1000000035_S0000003	from american public media this is marketplace tech demystifying the digital economy i'm molly wood
POD1000000035_S0000005	new jersey's governor recently went on t v asking for volunteers who know cobol a more than a sixty-year-old computer programming language
POD1000000035_S0000006	that because the state's unemployment benefits system runs on a decades-old mainframe that can't keep up with the volume of requests for financial help
POD1000000035_S0000007	and new jersey isn't alone several states not to mention a lot of financial institutions are all at the mercy of these very old systems running on a programming language that isn't even taught in schools anymore
POD1000000035_S0000008	joseph steinberg a cybersecurity consultant and author of the book cybersecurity for dummies
POD1000000035_S0000009	well first of all there are many financial institutions that use mainframes with cobol for back-end processing of transactions and batch processing
POD1000000035_S0000010	i think they probably have things in a lot better shape because they have the resources in-house
POD1000000035_S0000011	in some cases they've replaced the systems at great expense over recent years in some cases they're doing it now
POD1000000035_S0000012	and in some cases they've made the decisions to actually train people to be able to support these systems going forward
POD1000000035_S0000013	but when it comes to government and i would say probably even worse in the state governments than than in the federal
POD1000000035_S0000014	you have many systems that seem to hang around for a very long time
POD1000000035_S0000015	one of the questions that i i posed ah in the last week is simply if god forbid this pandemic continued for several more months and all americans had to vote in the presidential election remotely
POD1000000035_S0000016	um ah
POD1000000035_S0000017	do all fifty states actually have computer systems that could accommodate that volume of ballots going out and in to be counted processed in a secure fashion you know you know in in any reasonable time frame
POD1000000035_S0000018	and i'm afraid of what the answer to that question might be we simply have a lot of legacy systems involved in various state processes and they are not meant they were never designed to accommodate you know mass loads that could suddenly happen now
POD1000000035_S0000019	um ah
POD1000000035_S0000020	and it's a lot harder to scale these legacy systems you know
POD1000000035_S0000021	newer technologies scale much better and i'm afraid of what's out there you know at the state level
POD1000000035_S0000022	um and i'm sure there're some in the federal government but you know this ah ah after this pandemic is over it's really gonna be time to take a serious look at a lot of these older systems and evaluate whether they really are reliable only because we haven't had to make changes or they're really reliable
POD1000000035_S0000023	and i think in many cases we'll find it's the former
POD1000000035_S0000024	right i mean it seems like this is sort of an an invisible infrastructure problem in america that in some ways is as expensive and difficult to fix as road and bridges
POD1000000035_S0000025	it's as expensive and perhaps in some ways more dangerous because you don't notice it until the problem happens
POD1000000035_S0000026	right you have people who desperately need money because their work suddenly ended they place an unemployment claim and they can't get it processed
POD1000000035_S0000027	that can be dangerous people could be low on food and other supplies and it's not like they can easily obtain them now either
POD1000000035_S0000028	and i think that's precisely the issue with these older systems
POD1000000035_S0000029	often we assume that they're reliable until it's too late and the problem ah you know has hit and at that point you know you've got tactical problem how do we process these ah unemployment claims
POD1000000035_S0000030	and a strategic problem how do we make sure this never happens again in the future
POD1000000035_S0000031	you're saying that even if we were able to bring a lot of programmers out of retirement that these systems simply may not ever be able to handle the load that is being put on them now
POD1000000035_S0000032	it may be possible to scale them up with improved hardware but that's gonna be very expensive number one
POD1000000035_S0000033	and they don't scale as simply as more modern systems do so you know the fact that you're hiring programmers out of retirement and people don't live forever
POD1000000035_S0000034	you're not gonna have an endless supply of programmers who programmed in the seventies ah in the workforce
POD1000000035_S0000035	and i'm not saying that these systems aren't reliable they may be very reliable for what they do now
POD1000000035_S0000036	um ah
POD1000000035_S0000037	but we have to accept the fact that systems may need to be changed and may need to scale up suddenly and we may not be able to do with the existing technology and human resources
POD1000000035_S0000038	i mean i have been at companies that replatformed and it is hard and it's really expensive and what does that look like at a sort of state and national level what kind of investment in terms of both technology and money would that take
POD1000000035_S0000039	um the thing to keep in mind is there's also a political problem with things like this
POD1000000035_S0000040	you know if you're a state elected official and you have to budget a large amount of money for replacing the system no user of that system initially benefits from it
POD1000000035_S0000041	so you need to have the political um will which i think after this we will to invest the money before problems happen understanding that you're investing for the future
POD1000000035_S0000042	we should have our infrastructure set up that if there is an emergency in which people are dying the governor should be focused on people not on you know technical glitches in an unemployment system
POD1000000035_S0000043	right this is a speculative and ah vaguely nightmare scenario but at what point do you think companies
POD1000000035_S0000045	like amazon or microsoft or google might approach states and the federal government they maybe you need a a private solution a privatized infrastructure for some of this
POD1000000035_S0000047	um i don't know if they already have they they may have approached them years ago and been told that the system is working we have no need to replace it um i don't know
POD1000000035_S0000048	ah but you know i i'm sure that after this is all over as the governor himself said we're gonna have that post-mortem
POD1000000035_S0000049	and then after that post-mortem there just gonna be evaluations of many different options ah as to how to proceed and some of those will involve ah utilizing third-party resources potentially
POD1000000035_S0000050	ah by the way you could have a cloud that's run by the government it could be a private cloud system it could be their own infrastructure
POD1000000035_S0000051	ah you know there are many many options but moving away from the cobol code running on the mainframe to a more modern platform might allow for greater you know scalability suddenly if needed ah as well as for easier maintenance if you know code changes need to be made
POD1000000035_S0000052	and you you certainly not gonna need to go begging for ah programmers at a press conference
POD1000000035_S0000054	just upstander cause the cybersecurity consultant
POD1000000035_S0000056	and now for some related links we got a link to that twenty-sixteen report from the government accountability office which found that among other things the department of defense uses eight-inch floppy disks to coordinate some of the country's nuclear forces
POD1000000035_S0000057	you can see why they wanna get that big cloud project moving i guess
POD1000000035_S0000058	in other infrastructure news m i t technology review has a piece this week about how generally speaking the internet is holding up shockingly well in the midst of our big transition from work and school to home
POD1000000035_S0000059	it points out that cloud service providers and also streaming media and telecom companies
POD1000000035_S0000060	so thank amazon or comcast netflix microsoft google they all put a lot of money into new internet infrastructure in the past decade or so in order to keep delivering their services
POD1000000035_S0000061	and now this current crisis is generating even more investment
POD1000000035_S0000062	now if only we could do the same for the power grid and the bridges and the state and county mainframes
POD1000000035_S0000064	and here is what else for watching in tech a brutal week at yelp
POD1000000035_S0000065	the company that is basically built on small businesses is laying off a thousand people and furloughing another eleven hundred according to axios
POD1000000035_S0000066	yelp c e o will take no salary for the rest of the year and the company is cutting executive pay by twenty to thirty percent
POD1000000035_S0000068	also on thursday microsoft released a report about remote work trends based on data from its teams product
POD1000000035_S0000069	the company of course reported a huge increase in the number of people using teams
POD1000000035_S0000070	but the report has some super interesting data
POD1000000035_S0000071	for example it notes that people are using video obviously in their meetings a lot more than they ever did before
POD1000000035_S0000072	a thousand percent more in march in fact
POD1000000035_S0000073	but the u s lags a little bit in terms of video calling
POD1000000035_S0000074	in norway and the netherlands about sixty percent of calls include video but only thirty-eight percent of american meetings have the camera turned on
POD1000000035_S0000075	i mean listen i'm just gonna confess that i straight up refused to join a meeting by video on thursday because i for one can no longer stand the sight of my own forehead
POD1000000035_S0000076	i see you america or rather i only hear you
POD1000000035_S0000077	stephanie hughes producer of marketplace tech kasuses avroato is our assistant producer jodie baker is our senior editor robyn edgar is our engineer i'm molly wood and that's marketplace tech have a great weekend
POD1000000035_S0000078	this is a p m
POD1000000036_S0000001	facebook users in illinois could each be in line for a couple of hundred dollars for privacy violations what does that mean for the rest of us
POD1000000036_S0000002	from american public media this is marketplace tech demystifying the digital economic i'm jack steward and from molly wood
POD1000000036_S0000004	about a decade ago facebook started automatically tagging people whose faces its algorithms had recognized in our uploaded photos at the time it seemed like magic
POD1000000036_S0000005	but this week facebook has agree to pay five hundred and fifty million dollars over claims that tool violated privacy rights the settlement has in illinois which has strict laws protecting biometric data
POD1000000036_S0000006	facebook revealed the settlement agreement at the same time as its quarterly financial results this week and they by the way show the revenue was up twenty-five percent to twenty-one billion dollars at the end of last year
POD1000000036_S0000007	for today's quality assurance we have natasha singer a tech reporter for the new york times to explained what this settlement means
POD1000000036_S0000008	so illinois has the toughest biometric privacy law in the united states there are only three states that have these kind of laws
POD1000000036_S0000009	and so biometric privacy pertains to your fingerprints or facial scans for facial recognition and so in illinois the law says that companies can't collect that kind of information like facial data for facial recognition without getting written permission from someone
POD1000000036_S0000010	and also they can't collect the data without telling somebody how long they're gonna keep it and so facebook users in illinois sued facebook saying that it had collected their facial information and had not obtained their kind of affirmative opt-in permission and had not told them how long that facebook was gonna keep it
POD1000000036_S0000011	um facebook says that these claims are not true but facebook said that it settled this lawsuit because it was gonna you know drag on and take up too much resources and was better for everybody and the stockholders if they settled the lawsuit
POD1000000036_S0000012	do you think the size of this um facebook settlement might serve as a warning to other companies so considering this sort of technology
POD1000000036_S0000013	it it feels like maybe when facebook introduced things like facial recognition they were just looking at fun ways of using it and maybe some of the other implications are now coming to light
POD1000000036_S0000014	if you think about a face print right it's like the facial equivalent of your fingerprint and you might want to use your fingerprint for fun ways
POD1000000036_S0000015	but we kind of this really know that your fingerprint has all kinds of implications and it's unique so even the notion of facebook turning on facial recognition by default for fun things is problematic first of all in illinois
POD1000000036_S0000016	but also to a lot of people who are concerned that the problem with facial recognition is that it can be used to identify people without their knowledge at a distance
POD1000000036_S0000017	and so it implicates your ability to be anonymous both online and in public
POD1000000036_S0000018	do you think there's a chance we'll see companies basically defaulting to just not collecting any data like this ah ah at the risk of it somehow being regulated in the future
POD1000000036_S0000019	certainly i think companies that are having similar technology and they have illinois users must be thinking about it right cause it be think about like doorbell cams which are spreading everywhere
POD1000000036_S0000020	would your doorbell camera is gonna um take images of people and it's used for facial recognition right so that like it can recognize your babysitter so that they can come in in illinois you need consent for stuff like that
POD1000000036_S0000021	and so what does that mean for all kinds of devices that collect ambient biometric data um i think we don't have the answer to that i think that companies now because of the size of the facebook settlement are going to have to think about what their illinois plan is
POD1000000036_S0000022	i can't imagine that they want to have one set of software for illinois and another for the rest of the country first of all you know that's just from a business perspective inefficient
POD1000000036_S0000023	but second of all you know you don't want people in other parts of the country saying well you turned that off for illinois why haven't you turned it off for us
POD1000000036_S0000024	and so we're seeing for example with the california privacy law that there a number of companies microsoft apple have said we're gonna honor the rights under the california privacy law for everybody in the united states
POD1000000036_S0000025	it feels like when we talk about these privacy stories we we talk about you know the value of your privacy or the value of your data and it's always very hard to put a number on that
POD1000000036_S0000026	do you think things like this illinois settlement ah ah are starting to move in that direction and putting a a dollar value on these things
POD1000000036_S0000027	so i think the notion that there's a trade and you're trading your data for you know services so you're giving up some of your privacy is the silicon valley framing um that you're getting value for data
POD1000000036_S0000028	but when we think of a trade you know what you're giving up and what you're getting but when you give up your data you have no idea how it's gonna be used
POD1000000036_S0000029	it can be used perennially for all time for all kinds of purposes for which you didn't give it and i would argue that it's not a trade it's not a fair trade and i would also argue that um data is not property
POD1000000036_S0000030	in europe security and privacy are fundamental human rights and if we think of other fundamental human rights like the right of free speech you wouldn't say i'm trading my free speech for facebook services
POD1000000036_S0000031	so this notion that we're trading our right to privacy for services i think is just a problematic framing
POD1000000036_S0000033	for the new york times according to the chicago tribune a federal called judge must approve the facebook settlement
POD1000000036_S0000034	and then members of the class action
POD1000000036_S0000036	claims for part of the money
POD1000000036_S0000038	for some related links today check out the natash's story at the new york times for more detail on the settlement and next steps as well as coverage from the chicago tribune for more and why illinois has become so important for privacy lawsuits
POD1000000036_S0000039	and then if you didn't read it a couple of weeks ago well set aside a good few minutes to completely digest the new york times story the secretive company that might end privacy as we know it it's about clearview a i a little-known company that created an app for law enforcement to use facial recognition
POD1000000036_S0000040	as the article says without public scrutiny more than six hundred law enforcement agencies have started using clearview in the past year and while big tech companies are at least facing some scrutiny for their facial recognition efforts this company seems to have flown under the radar until now
POD1000000036_S0000041	well so what you might think i've done nothing wrong why does it matter if my face is recognized in public privacy campaigners would argue that we're just not aware yet of everything that we're giving up
POD1000000036_S0000042	the new york times took the feeds from three public webcams in new york and photos from employer websites
POD1000000036_S0000043	and using that they match two thousand seven hundred and fifty faces it's just one example they found a professor on his way to lunch with a job candidate
POD1000000036_S0000044	as the times says our experiment shows that a person equipped with just a few cameras and facial recognition technology can learn people's daily habits when they arrive at the office each day who they get coffee with whether they left work early
POD1000000036_S0000045	the professor's reaction when he was told was oh my god that's unbelievable but these days it really is easier and easier to believe
POD1000000036_S0000046	i'm jack steward and that's marketsplace tech
POD1000000036_S0000048	this is a p m
POD1000000037_S0000001	summer camp fresh air burned fires or you know stay inside and learning how to shoot youtube videos
POD1000000037_S0000003	american public media this is marketplace tech demystifying the digital economy
POD1000000037_S0000004	i'm jed kim in for molly wood
POD1000000037_S0000006	summer vacation is rapidly approaching for some families that means sending kids to camp some of those are youtube camps
POD1000000037_S0000007	these are essentially places where kids can learn how to create slicker youtube videos and channels
POD1000000037_S0000008	the demand has grown as kids want to emulate the online stars they watch
POD1000000037_S0000009	julie jargon is the family and tech columnist at the wall street journal when she wrote about the trend
POD1000000037_S0000010	she said kids learn how to light shoot and edit videos also how to develop their personal brains
POD1000000037_S0000011	they're teaching them to create their own unique voice so that they can stand out in the crowd of youtubers and develop original content
POD1000000037_S0000012	um but you know a lot of the kids i talked to they just want to shoot videos of themselves playing fortnite
POD1000000037_S0000013	so there's a lot of that already but that's what a lot of kids are interested in doing they they watch the youtubers playing video games and then they want to do it themselves
POD1000000037_S0000014	yeah i can say it i hear youtube camp and my initial reaction is gross
POD1000000037_S0000016	but i know that's just my like me being uninformed and reactionary ah help me understand the value of this
POD1000000037_S0000017	well you know i mean i think that's the reaction actually of a lot of parents and i there is a debate ah raging a lot of households right now about whether to allow children to have their own youtube channels
POD1000000037_S0000018	and a lot of the you know the first time reaction from parents is no
POD1000000037_S0000019	you know there are there are a lot of concerns about kids being exposed publicly and being open to bullying and predators and all that stuff that we worry about on the internet
POD1000000037_S0000020	but a lot of the parents i spoke to who also shared those concerns you know kind of went about it thoughtfully and said well my kid wants to do something they're passionate about it how do i foster that
POD1000000037_S0000021	and is there a way to look at youtube as a medium that can be an outlet for their creativity to develop the skills that they might not be able to develop on their own at home
POD1000000037_S0000022	and also how can those skills trans like to other life experiences
POD1000000037_S0000023	um and also just learning the poise and the composure of speaking on film and addressing audiences
POD1000000037_S0000024	you know those are all good things for kids to know how to do
POD1000000037_S0000025	yes summer is is i guess is like blank canvas for kids to do whatever they want or i guess what their parents want them to learn
POD1000000037_S0000026	and are parents more valuing developing digital skills than they were in the past
POD1000000037_S0000027	i think so i think there's a growing awareness of the fact that these kind of skills could be useful for future careers i mean gaming it alone is such a huge industry
POD1000000037_S0000028	a lot of kids go to coding camps to learn how to code video games
POD1000000037_S0000029	um so there are a lot of digital sort of skills that ah you know older generation of parents don't have and they're seeing that it could be applicable to future career choices for their children
POD1000000037_S0000030	some parents are you know they are increasingly concerned about screen time and like social media and spending all day video gaming they even if it is for learning
POD1000000037_S0000031	so what makes a family more wary of tech compared to other families that are like go for it
POD1000000037_S0000032	you know i i was just think it comes down to an individual choice and and individual feelings about technology some families just really embrace it and they don't want their kids to be behind
POD1000000037_S0000033	um and they feel like if their kids aren't learning these skills or aware of what's going on on social media and the internet more broadly that they will somehow be social outcasts or they won't have the skills to be competitive in you know in the future workforce
POD1000000037_S0000034	other parents are just really cautious i mean it's not what we ah grew up with
POD1000000037_S0000035	and so there you know you hear the horror stories and you you hear about online bullying and youtube is a very public forum and people can leave you know mean comments
POD1000000037_S0000036	and ah you know is a child really ready to deal with that um you know they are are they developmentally ready and emotionally ready to um let it roll off their skin when someone posts a mean comment about their video
POD1000000037_S0000037	um that's a difficult thing for adults to even face um that kind of criticism from the trolls and so parents have to really prepare their kids for that
POD1000000037_S0000038	i mean there are things you can do you can moderate the comments that are posted on youtube you can turn them off um you can make a youtube channel private so no one can see it
POD1000000037_S0000039	that sort of defeats the whole purpose of posting on youtube though because it's meant to be shared and um youtube videos are meant to be commented on so um
POD1000000037_S0000040	it's just a whole new world that parents are trying to navigate and and i think it really comes down to personal choice as to whether you you want your kids to jump into that world or ah maybe kind of keep them away from it to the extent possible
POD1000000037_S0000041	let's talk a little more about kind of the fame side of things some camps that you found were cautioning against building expectations that your kid gonna be a star
POD1000000037_S0000042	but other camps were like using it as a marketing point
POD1000000037_S0000043	anything problematic with that
POD1000000037_S0000044	yeah i mean ah what what the reality of you know what are the chances that your child is going to achieve some sort of youtube fame
POD1000000037_S0000045	probably pretty slim considering how many videos are on youtube and sort of the mystery about what um the algorithm chooses to push up you know you can create a video and get no views
POD1000000037_S0000046	i mean it's really hard sometimes to sift through all the videos and find a video on a particular topic um you know and there are something like a a billion hours of youtube videos viewed daily
POD1000000037_S0000047	um so how do you break through the clutter and make your video stand out
POD1000000037_S0000048	i mean and you know i think parents have to be realistic with themselves and with their children that just because he posted a video to youtube doesn't mean you're gonna start you know having a million subscribers and
POD1000000037_S0000049	right
POD1000000037_S0000050	and you know advertising and sponsorship contracts and that kind of thing
POD1000000037_S0000051	i mean there are certainly people have achieved fame and fortune on youtube but just like with anything else you know you're not gonna become necessarily the next star n b a player just because you go to a basketball camp
POD1000000037_S0000052	so i think you know you have to you have to just be realistic and and understand what you and your what your child want to achieve with their youtube channel
POD1000000037_S0000053	julie jargon writes about family and tech at the wall street journal i ask her if this means more kids will be coming home from camps starting conversation by saying
POD1000000037_S0000054	hey guys medicine here i've gotten a couple of great things to share with you julie said yeah that's already happening even outside of the camp
POD1000000037_S0000056	and now for some related links interested to know how youtube is working to weed out the objectionable videos that get uploaded
POD1000000037_S0000057	vox sat down with neal mohan the company's chief product officer he says it's not about just finding bad videos and removing them it's about constantly updating the user guidelines for computers and human workers to follow
POD1000000037_S0000058	among the staggering stats you'll read five hundred hours of video content get uploaded every minute more than ten thousand people have been hired to make the final decision of whether a video stays or goes
POD1000000037_S0000059	and mohan says corpus no fewer than seven times corpus as in the full body of work on youtube
POD1000000037_S0000061	let's see what else we got how about the promise of making money through your youtube channel
POD1000000037_S0000062	business insider lays out the path to getting your channel into the youtube partner program first thing you have to do in order to be eligible
POD1000000037_S0000063	have at least a thousand subscribers and your audience has to have watched four thousand hours of you in the past year
POD1000000037_S0000064	there's a lot more that goes into it from there like different tiers at which you can access more tools it's a little daunting
POD1000000037_S0000065	and finally learning camps are a way to combat the dreaded summer slide or that thing where your kid gets dumber during the months when they're not in school
POD1000000037_S0000066	lots of articles churned out every year at this time with ways to fight it we found some articles in parenting and read brightly that suggest apps to help

POD1000000039_S0000041	did you ever write a letter back to steve sampson

POD1000000039_S0000081	and at that time we just needed a couple hugs we'll face the realities in a little while but right now you just let it sink
POD1000000039_S0000082	here the the last team ah in the world cup thirty-two of thirty-two teams somethings have changed
POD1000000039_S0000083	i can only think like the godfather when they

POD1000000039_S0000087	a day off than last the yugoslavia steve told the washington post he wanted to remain head coach and that he wouldn't let a few disgruntled players dictate his future
POD1000000039_S0000089	but things change quickly
POD1000000039_S0000091	after his boss u s soccer federation president alan rothenberg invited him to breakfast in paris

POD1000000039_S0000105	so you're angry yourself
POD1000000039_S0000106	i wasn't angry but i am you know my moment of reflection was
POD1000000039_S0000108	this is what i was afraid of

POD1000000039_S0000111	yes

POD1000000039_S0000216	and i'm looking at an incredibly clean desk clean desk clean mind
POD1000000039_S0000217	next to a picture of his children there's a framed photo of that notorious red card he got playing against mexico in nineteen ninety-seven
POD1000000039_S0000218	a habit up to remind me that you can control things about yourself but you can't control what other people do and the only thing you can do is control what you can and
POD1000000039_S0000220	i don't believe it was a red card but that doesn't matter it was a red card and i hurt my team and there were ramifications because of the red card professionally and personally
POD1000000039_S0000222	which brings us back to steve sampson
POD1000000039_S0000224	this career in reverse front loading the big dream job before drifting back towards the roots of the game
POD1000000039_S0000226	after france sampson went on to coach the costa rican national team and had spent some time at the club level coaching the los angeles galaxy
POD1000000039_S0000228	today steve is head coach of the california polytechnic state university

POD1000000039_S0000233	lee showing us the jersey's hanging on his wall one in particular has a place of honor
POD1000000039_S0000234	but the red short sleeved jersey signed by all the players have participated in the world cup in france ah again very proud to have had the opportunity to coach these men
POD1000000039_S0000235	does it not conjure even a hint a hint of a dark memory of challenge times when your eyes look at it
POD1000000039_S0000237	oh certainly i mean you know it's like i've told people i've experienced the highs of highs and lows of lows and and it's all part of the journey
POD1000000039_S0000238	that jersey represents to me the entire lead up the qualification phase all the great moments that we had over the years leading up ah to the world cup and it's of course it it conjures up
POD1000000039_S0000239	some disappointment of ah not achieving what we set out to do but you know in the end ah an enormous amount of pride
POD1000000039_S0000240	even in the darkness steve
POD1000000039_S0000241	and i'm gonna be honest steve you have endured more than most more than most managers that i have engaged with despite the darkness is that nineteen ninety-eight world cup is it start a life high point
POD1000000039_S0000243	the nineteen ninety-eight world cup it isn't just in it wasn't just about those three weeks in france um
POD1000000039_S0000244	it was about probably a period of time that was one of the most dramatic important moments in in u s soccer history
POD1000000039_S0000245	and to have been a part of that um was a great honor and a great privilege
POD1000000039_S0000247	i don't
POD1000000039_S0000249	i don't dismiss my responsibilities at all or my share in the responsibilities
POD1000000039_S0000251	but i think that all of us you know
POD1000000039_S0000253	everybody should share in the responsibility
POD1000000039_S0000255	i think there were factors that that unfortunately didn't give us a very best chance of being successful and that's what has made me angry over the years that's what has made me disappointed over the years

POD1000000039_S0000279	for almost everyone i spoke with it's the game of soccer in the u s the fight for respect for legitimacy in belonging both within the united states and externally in the eyes of the world
POD1000000039_S0000281	more than anything nineteen ninety-eight was supposed to be the year that this group of guys playing this game finally won over the great and carrying american audience to establish the game they loved
POD1000000039_S0000282	soccer long derided in the united states is a truly major league sport

POD1000000039_S0000294	the rest of the time the way they are during that month and by going out in ignominious fashion humiliating fashion
POD1000000039_S0000296	i did this is in some ways usually too strong a word to apply to sports but
POD1000000039_S0000298	this was disgraceful fashion ah they heard soccer
POD1000000039_S0000300	so the damage to the profile of the game ah you had people watching

POD1000000039_S0000319	but i care ah and we failed and i i don't like the failure even though i know the
POD1000000039_S0000322	and nobody ever said this out loud but i'm gonna i am not until brandi chastain said it in nineteen ninety-nine that we have a good feeling about the sport but the boys had blown it
POD1000000039_S0000323	we had really lost a lot of respect from from the world and internally

POD1000000040_S0000036	yeah exactly i
POD1000000040_S0000038	it's kinda what i wanted to talk about because um on this show ah few weeks ago we had mentioned that you guys were back to shooting a lot people were asking us what the protocols and everything ah like that was for shooting now i have seen ah pictures from the set of like
POD1000000040_S0000039	blackish for example right
POD1000000040_S0000041	yeah
POD1000000040_S0000042	they're currently in in same with the this is us ah they're currently in in glass cubes of emotion where everybody is sealed off on set with some form of plexiglass
POD1000000040_S0000043	ah you are kind of ah studying your sides and lines um behind the plexiglass and then they're calling in teams one by one and when i say teams ah usually starts with what
POD1000000040_S0000045	ah they do their job and then they move out and then the directors they move out and then you guys go in for blocking ah which is rehearsal and and move out is that is that happening to you guys too because i mean you guys are in action packed show like i just find it so difficult to imagine
POD1000000040_S0000046	it's it's it's it's ah you know at the beginning of the season when when we came back we all fired up to come back and you know you can't there is no hugging there is no nothing there is no like touching it's the weirdest thing and everybody's wearing mask the whole time
POD1000000040_S0000047	ah and we're broken up into you know the reds red team blue team ah and various different other teams that they have and then we come in last when everything's done we rehearse with our masks on
POD1000000040_S0000048	and then when they say action we take off do the scene and put our masks back on and then leave the area then blue team blue ah team comes in and then fix whatever adjustments
POD1000000040_S0000049	um but if you're on red team you're getting tested three times ah a week
POD1000000040_S0000051	ah so monday wednesday friday or or at least seventy-two hours before you show up to set ah for filming
POD1000000040_S0000052	um so i'm actually in route right now to ah to go get my testing so maybe while we're doing the show see something being stuck in my nose cause i will do it live
POD1000000040_S0000054	let's do it
POD1000000040_S0000056	hey listen ah so i've got the script where it's basically just me spitting in people's mouth you telling me i can't get that made right now
POD1000000040_S0000058	i mean may be for redtube or youporn
POD1000000040_S0000060	people are kink shaming right now
POD1000000040_S0000062	that's one of one of my kinks is to walk around in public without a fucking mask on
POD1000000040_S0000063	yeah it is
POD1000000040_S0000065	yeah that's how i've i've jerked off in a lot of bars and olds bathrooms i'll say that
POD1000000040_S0000067	so so nipple clamps and no mask i mean that is you're you're you're on to something
POD1000000040_S0000068	just a light touch of electricity
POD1000000040_S0000069	yeah i looked cuomo's got some nipple rings
POD1000000040_S0000070	he does yeah but he got studs of loads through there
POD1000000040_S0000072	yeah it it appears to be studs in that rings which i guess is another kink right
POD1000000040_S0000075	and i don't know
POD1000000040_S0000076	cuomo cuomo the the the governor of new york
POD1000000040_S0000078	you saw that
POD1000000040_S0000079	yeah you never saw that picture

POD1000000040_S0000088	a lot he was he was wearing a white shirt kinda look like a polo ah which is not conducive for nipple ring and you know um i he does what he does
POD1000000040_S0000089	um and and obviously we we don't kink shame like we just said on on the show but it's it's weird to see a sixty-five year old man with nipple rings yeah yeah it is
POD1000000040_S0000091	now i wonder if it's ah that was a decision he made or if some of a woman talked him into and if so what's up with a woman that wants to see a sixty-five year old with with nipple studs you know
POD1000000040_S0000092	yeah
POD1000000040_S0000093	or or may maybe he just lost a bet

POD1000000040_S0000096	i ah a a hundred percent

POD1000000040_S0000116	yeah yeah and and again you are on a family show so we we'll move on from it but speaking of of being on a family show i know c b s made the decision to cut back your episode order due to covid
POD1000000040_S0000117	um and they did they did the shows on the network um yeah well how many how many episodes you guys doing this year
POD1000000040_S0000118	ah we are only doing fourteen but if you include the two hour premier which is two episodes that we didn't air last year cause like the season ended on such like a a weird note was like
POD1000000040_S0000120	season finale but a lot of people you know didn't understand did not understand still the covid impact yet that we had shut down so we couldn't finish filming and so the season ended
POD1000000040_S0000122	but i can tell you this that the season opener yeah the studio or network or t v is is pretty damn good and really proud of it but yeah we we are shooting fourteen as opposed to ah twenty-two episodes
POD1000000040_S0000124	got you ah um with the recent shutdown did that knock a couple episodes off that schedule like is it like is it like the
POD1000000040_S0000126	football is it that they were doing were like hey man if you guys miss too bad tough shit um and then if that is the case do they dock you and pay you and do you get pay for what you sign on for contractually
POD1000000040_S0000127	no we get we all every everybody on the crew and everybody took like um we almost lost half in pay
POD1000000040_S0000128	no
POD1000000040_S0000130	yeah bit yeah we sort of just you know that's that's yeah that's the part that sucks we have a contract that says twenty-two but you know this is called like within the within the language of c b s this thing called force measured and so it's
POD1000000040_S0000132	god yeah so they this is this is an act of god if you want to say that or somebody creating in a lab
POD1000000040_S0000134	it is it's a same thing with ah with ah terrorism or anything like that is
POD1000000040_S0000135	yeah
POD1000000040_S0000136	it's hard to get ensured
POD1000000040_S0000138	yeah so they ah yeah they do that and every body just that ah you know suck it up and deal with it and again i always
POD1000000040_S0000140	the amount of thanks that i have here and i mean this sincerely that i have for this job and and get to go do this job and its its by far the
POD1000000040_S0000141	the greatest acting gig i've ever had in my life and it's so much fun so to have lost the job because of covid and not come back which almost happened completely because we're a very expensive show
POD1000000040_S0000142	ah hm
POD1000000040_S0000143	we're a big show and
POD1000000040_S0000145	you know c b s lost a lot of money um due to like the n c double a and all sorts of stuff and you know they just they just didn't know how to how we are gonna deal with one of the benefits for us we shoot outside a lot
POD1000000040_S0000147	yeah you guys have a dope ass ah outdoor set yeah
POD1000000040_S0000148	yeah and then um ah and then our our our show runner um spencer and chris um julak ah really ah
POD1000000040_S0000149	tryna put our heads together and look this is how we can adapt and overcome and and we can create more
POD1000000040_S0000151	stories this way and um cause there was a huge budget cut too there like you guys can come back but you can only do this show for this amount which like was was basically next to impossible for like it might being so much half of the budget that we lost
POD1000000040_S0000152	as well
POD1000000040_S0000153	yeah
POD1000000040_S0000154	ah and
POD1000000040_S0000156	you know this this the season we've gotten more into like the the character stuff where you know what what's going behind ah ah you know mostly what these guys are supposed to you know these big action sequences
POD1000000040_S0000157	which i don't believe we could have really done in season one two maybe three but it's you're able to do that so i think every second or third episode there will be like a big action sequence of it'll be little ones here and there but will have these big sort of blow out
POD1000000040_S0000158	um and i just being able to go deeper into the psychology of of of the of the guys and the families and and what sort of happening um behind closed doors
POD1000000040_S0000159	um and and i and i do think that for what the hand that the the the writers had been dealt um and sort of the unknown space that we're now working in
POD1000000040_S0000160	ah i i think that they they'd really held it together sea mosses and and was actually shooting sea mosses episode ah you guy know mark right
POD1000000040_S0000161	yeah yeah yeah
POD1000000040_S0000162	yeah ah and he is one of my favorite writers on the on the show um that's just cause he wrote the submarine episode but just i just think he's you know he is he knows the world
POD1000000040_S0000164	than anybody
POD1000000040_S0000165	that was a tough one for you i mean did you ah how long you were actually in that tube

POD1000000040_S0000297	like the c b c or actually reading facts and just and educating yourself on there realizing
POD1000000040_S0000298	that go to where the science is and not where the narrative is that needs to be pushed and maybe you'll get
POD1000000040_S0000300	this is not saying
POD1000000040_S0000302	you you democrat or republican you just be an american and do your research and stop being a sheep and and just hearing what one thing and or just repeating what your friends are or just start shaming people because
POD1000000040_S0000303	you feel that that's what it is you need to do it it just it's gotten to the point now especially here in l a where everybody is you know the cancel culture and everybody's so fucking righteous about what they know
POD1000000040_S0000304	but then when you ask them about just basic things they're
POD1000000040_S0000306	they they can't answer because they don't they don't do the research
POD1000000040_S0000307	no one does yeah no one does and then and then even when you you know you think you have the answer like um there was a a first responder like edward edward ten point three million listeners ah eighty percent of them are military first responder right
POD1000000040_S0000308	so i got this text from a first responder that i'd i'd like to read here um because here's here's what we're we're headed for um he works in a major city ah all i'll say is it is top ten in america
POD1000000040_S0000309	ah city wise cause elvin adams he is a he's a paramedic um so he just got the word last night that ah he'll be able to take the vaccine um as early as up to next week
POD1000000040_S0000310	ah he's a paramedic he says it is the pfizer vaccine he says it will be two shots spaced apart by two weeks um supposedly this is what they're telling him you're gonna get sick for about two days
POD1000000040_S0000311	ah it's gotta be stored in temperatures of minus a hundred and seven degrees celsius
POD1000000040_S0000312	holy shit
POD1000000040_S0000313	yes it can only be out of that temperature for three hours before going bad ah so they have to get it to you pretty quickly once it's taken like out of the freezer right um now the reason why he broke me this last night is is ah
POD1000000040_S0000314	ah he here's what else he went on to say was that and i said um
POD1000000040_S0000316	ah you know how do you feel about taking this ah cause he's the first responder and what they're trying to do ah allegedly is give this to all the first responders first because obviously they're treating people every single day and they're dealing with covid patients and all that shit they go how do you feel about it and he's like well
POD1000000040_S0000317	for some reason and i'm just reading this for biden here cause he allowed me to um which is for some reason they're gonna keep this pretty hush hush ah the reality is there is no cure he said this he he personally believes
POD1000000040_S0000318	and and this is what ah i wanted to ask you cause your wife has worked in this field he says this is not going to stop covid-nineteen it will always be here it may take up years for us to build the immunity for it that's why there will never be a cure for h i v or the flu
POD1000000040_S0000319	it's a virus they mutate the strain ah that's here in united states is not the same one that is in europe so maybe one day it will be like the other corona viruses which which you know are are basically just like the common cold
POD1000000040_S0000320	ah he says you know as a first responder this is a fucking shit show he's like i've been around this thing for every day since i have been ah working at the very beginning exposed to treating patients with it
POD1000000040_S0000321	ah so for i'm not caught it nor do i have the antibodies and i don't know whether or not i want to take this vaccine because fuck it there's too much unknown about the vaccine that's currently coming out
POD1000000040_S0000322	and him personally as a first responder he's saying this is not enough data that i would trust taking this thing
POD1000000040_S0000323	no there's
POD1000000040_S0000325	definitely not i mean ah this thing was rushed
POD1000000040_S0000327	it take you it take seven years minimum for ah for it to for for any vaccine i mean i personally i've never got a flu shot before i've never i'm not anti-vaxxer like my kids have all been vaccinated but i prefer like the flu shot you know i've always
POD1000000040_S0000328	been a believer about like your immune system figure it out yeah there's especially especially when we're in ninety-nine point eight-six you know my mom she's in in on the other side i think ah she's seventy and that rate she has a
POD1000000040_S0000329	rate so ninety-four point something
POD1000000040_S0000331	yeah so um but again it's like do i tell her and then she has some sort of auto-immune like we just they haven't there's just no data in this it's you know what's scary is like first they were like hey do your self a favor and and
POD1000000040_S0000332	for the good of society wear a mask please now they're like it's mandated
POD1000000040_S0000333	now it's like hey we got this vaccine hope you guys would take it and what i'm worried is that they're gonna be like they start to you don't take it like with a ticketmaster
POD1000000040_S0000335	that's exactly where i was going with this what if they say this to you hey man in order to come back and shoot you have gotta take this vaccine
POD1000000040_S0000336	and i've gotta go find another job i gotta you know i gotta join you up on your podcast
POD1000000040_S0000337	yeah it's fine
POD1000000040_S0000339	we're hiring
POD1000000040_S0000341	we have more chairs in here in use
POD1000000040_S0000343	i don't i don't know i i really i don't
POD1000000040_S0000344	there's i unless you get at least two to three years of stuff it's like if i'm ninety-nine
POD1000000040_S0000345	ninety-nine point nine six whatever the fuck it is of survival why do i need to do this you know and you know what the common sense thing
POD1000000040_S0000346	you know what my wife and i've talked about this because when she the ward that she worked in during flu season
POD1000000040_S0000347	um which was a coronavirus and if you look on the back of the lysol bottle right prior to any of this break outbreak
POD1000000040_S0000348	look at the back of lysol bottle it says kills coronavirus right and so this is you know the flu has been the the strain of this satanic covid-nineteen so you know and during every flu season
POD1000000040_S0000349	they would take their immune compromised ah in the ward and they would
POD1000000040_S0000350	isolate them from they'd limit in out of people coming in to see this ward cause they would fear for that they got that thing they would die kind of like what's happening right now except you were still able to go to ah go to work
POD1000000040_S0000352	you know and the thing that ah ah somebody can prove me wrong on this is
POD1000000040_S0000354	our
POD1000000040_S0000356	death toll in america from two thousand and okay ah two thousand eighteen and two thousand nineteen of are are in total deaths
POD1000000040_S0000357	were still less this year or maybe we could last time could be a little higher or could be even um from the last i think two thousand eighteen was a huge year
POD1000000040_S0000359	our sixty-five thousand people died of the flu i think yeah
POD1000000040_S0000360	yeah so but we're still the numbers were not we're not way past what our regular death toll is for the entire country for the year so i'm just it just i i've never seem to get the answer well
POD1000000040_S0000361	why why is that if this is a pandemic we're we're we're exceeding our yearly death rate then why we're nothing but but pandemic usually when you're exceeded
POD1000000040_S0000362	so and it's i just it's there's so many unanswered questions i think everybody that is really questioning it and just looking at numbers is starting to go hold on a second here this doesn't this doesn't make sense
POD1000000040_S0000363	you know and and when someone then can't give you the answer back is supposed to just shut up and and and and you need to verge your signals with us and do what you're told and it's like that's not my just give me the answer so i understand if you can provide the proper thing
POD1000000040_S0000364	and tell me based on fact and science i'm i'll comply but until you can't and and give me the reasons then i i'm not doing it i'm not gonna let my kids do it and i'm not i mean look at the the schools that have been open
POD1000000040_S0000365	there's when were have you heard of any deaths in schools
POD1000000040_S0000366	no no and my kids are in school right now and i've got you know i've got a six-year-old and a two year old both of them are in school they're fine ah you know as parents we get these e-mails or text messages ah if something bad happens obviously
POD1000000040_S0000367	um kind of like everything else these days it's you know some app that come comes to your phone or whatever three of my son's teachers have had the coronavirus and i will get this e-mail that says hey the teacher tested positive we've removed the teacher
POD1000000040_S0000368	but the kids have stayed none of the kids have gotten coronavirus um they're fine they've removed the teacher to quarantine for fourteen days and then they come back and ah so far so good is for school ah has has gone but um you know until we
POD1000000040_S0000369	come up with some form of plan ah to to keep everybody working in the economy and kids in school and all this of the shit um man i i don't know what's going to happen because you know ah look at your industry in particular ah with
POD1000000040_S0000370	with hollywood right
POD1000000040_S0000371	you're you're hanging on by a thread as far as the theatrical movies go right now no one will go to the theatres not not only because of a you know you're twenty percent capacity or whatever it is
POD1000000040_S0000372	um the theatres can afford to stay open but also studios have pushed all of their movies ah until at least april or may of next year as far as being released in the theatres so even if they were open there's nothing to put in them
POD1000000040_S0000373	i've i've got a theory
POD1000000040_S0000375	ah i'd love i'd love to hear it
POD1000000040_S0000377	what this is less of a theory and more of like what if so what if
POD1000000040_S0000379	someone who is ah i don't know not a lefty and not a giant pussy decides to open their own theatre and then that becomes the avenue for watching live shit
POD1000000040_S0000380	but then hollywood has to start pivoting towards audiences that would go which were more conservative audiences
POD1000000040_S0000381	so does hollywood become conservative twenty years from now because the only audience they have left are conservatives who actually show and watch shit now how funny would that fucking be
POD1000000040_S0000382	yeah you know i it is kind of look it's kind of happening in texas right now so dan and i have tickets to go see billboard next weekend right
POD1000000040_S0000383	um i have been to this venue before it holds about two to three thousand people you have to wear a mask to get in once you're in you take off that mask it was a country concert there maybe two months ago right i saw girls there was a table full of girls
POD1000000040_S0000384	next to me about eight of them raging their faces off doing shots dancing on top of tables like no mask no nothing and it was just like what are we doing um you know so i think it depends on where you are and what you do for a living because ah right
POD1000000040_S0000385	now the the other thing that has sold out around here is drive-in movies ah and they're showing old movies and and it's a blast if you've kids and all that stuff
POD1000000040_S0000386	that we just we just went to one ah last it was a premier ah the croods and ah the the second croods the kids especially great with if you love nick cage i'm the biggest nick cage
POD1000000040_S0000387	everyone nick cage is a national treasure god dammit
POD1000000040_S0000388	no no no pun intended
POD1000000040_S0000390	ah he he like him and ryan reynolds it's fucking brilliant and i highly recommend anybody to go see that movie
POD1000000040_S0000391	ah ah but we went it was our first drive and we took our kids and i gotta tell you it was a blast like we had we'd put the mattress in the back in the cadillac and like pop the thing and they didn't know what they went in kind of have this like drive-through
POD1000000040_S0000392	ah not like red carpet thing but like you drive-through and like they had this all sort of like light tunnel with all the big characters in which it was just it was like the pivot that they made to make that experience for the kids and then we got there
POD1000000040_S0000393	and you know you get your popcorn and stuff that they had a blast you know and it was i enjoyed it like i i'm done the driving through and it was my wife's first driving
POD1000000040_S0000394	oh wow oh wow
POD1000000040_S0000395	ah so that was that was awesome so i mean if they can start doing that sort of stuff like um awesome the theaters can pivot and and do that and still make their money
POD1000000040_S0000396	i think that's a a great thing but did just go back to something you said there about the kids that really concerns me is
POD1000000040_S0000398	these these these people don't understand um or i i don't i don't think so they're putting the thought into we don't know how bad we're re fucking up our kids by by doing this
POD1000000040_S0000399	our kids learn to get and you grow by this being interactive and and playing on the playground and and wrestling and and just being a kid
POD1000000040_S0000400	and there was this opportunity for like when my daughter was in the pod work five families got together and we hired this teacher and one of her friends um had some space in their house so they created like you know classroom
POD1000000040_S0000401	five kids taking the curriculum and just teaching it and they've had it's been the best thing ever for the kids because they're able just to see there and they don't have to wear mask and they have to this and then the school says some days ago like we're gonna allow you back
POD1000000040_S0000403	but everybody has to wear mask all the time they are gonna be six feet apart at all the times if your child falls unfortunately our teachers can't go and pick them up or remove their mask i'm like what the what wha wha
POD1000000040_S0000404	like you just all these weird rules and am i i'm i'm gonna i'm gonna our kids our my daughter she knows what covid is but it it's such a depressing word for her and like seeing my seeing my boys
POD1000000040_S0000405	you know it term of had to travel we had to wear these masks and then processing like this is no it's just heart-breaking i i just don't think the though um has been put into what damage we are create what this
POD1000000040_S0000406	this hypochondriac o c d stuff about we are creating we're an weirdness of people so if they chalk chalk of some people be afraid it's like i would show up i remember picking my daughter up from a a montessori
POD1000000040_S0000407	and literally a a you have to go back to this play ground where they'd they'd ah ah where they'd be after school this is you know two years ago three years ago and like i walked up and she was literally licking the slide you know and i'm like
POD1000000040_S0000408	what are you doing she said it tastes good daddy i'm like oh my god and then like two days later she had have like a sniffle or cold and she get over it but it's like it's like that what how that's how we grow i'm sure you guys were awkward you know go and play dirty and
POD1000000040_S0000409	there was no hand sanitizers and you spill them and you insist them and like they just not consistently hand sanitizing what we got to get you got even as adults you have to build up this for the immunity to to do and hiding from
POD1000000040_S0000410	a disease is not gonna if you look at the numbers at youta
POD1000000040_S0000412	and colorado right youta didn't lockdown in the in the way that colorado did and they have half the numbers of what colorado
POD1000000040_S0000413	yeah but youta at this moment they are not allowed to touch each other i don't think
POD1000000040_S0000415	but it's like just like none of the none of that makes sense and and and i think when you leave it to these governors to sort of use it as the sort of power hungry you know
POD1000000040_S0000416	way to control your your there's gonna be a a you know there's already people talk a i afraid a lot of people saying like if the this continues there's there's gonna be a push back and it's gonna be a big one
POD1000000040_S0000417	you know there's so much that you can there was so great about this country and i am an emigrant to this country and what's so great about this country is the that the ability to you need free speech and and and to
POD1000000040_S0000418	to live your life and i think when you start basing mixing politics with medicine it's an slippery slope that we go down and i and i really believe that you are taking away the fundamentals of why
POD1000000040_S0000419	this country is so great you are centering people's speech you are um you are putting rules and stuff where if you don't whether if you disagree and don't conform you will be pino eyesed and i think that
POD1000000040_S0000420	is a very and and it just pisses me off that people are not open to hearing when you say this is crazy you know i suppose i just now go now miss phone what i am told it's like
POD1000000040_S0000421	what where where have you all gone like how how is it if you vocal about
POD1000000040_S0000423	ah something that than you are you know you are against it and is suppose to just questioning to understand better so you can give me the proper facts so i can make the best decision base on looking those facts
POD1000000040_S0000424	to ah for my family when you can't provide that so how can i make your decision so therefore when they keep questioning
POD1000000040_S0000425	yeah
POD1000000040_S0000426	and it just an and i think that's the disconnect that people don't understand because just conforming to facts that don't make sense i don't know how that's a good thing
POD1000000040_S0000427	yeah it's not i mean we're we're turning like you were talking about with the kids we're turning this whole generation into ah tony shalhoub and munk basically
POD1000000040_S0000429	gonna be great detectives but they're gonna be walking around with hand sanitizer afraid to touch things for the rest of their lives
POD1000000040_S0000430	and
POD1000000040_S0000432	what happens when there is like covid-twenty and this ah like we've never done this before so is
POD1000000040_S0000433	no it's stupid
POD1000000040_S0000434	we're gonna like we're gonna freak out every time there is a ah flu bug or that there is
POD1000000040_S0000435	yeah
POD1000000040_S0000436	this and like and we're just gonna have that there is i guess there is no there is this does doesn't make sense there is no way in hell anybody in my family is taking that vaccine
POD1000000040_S0000437	i've been strong with my wife she agrees with it and you know if that's if it comes to that then well i think there would be more push back of people that won't where though like you're gonna like have to do this and i think more people are gonna be like well then i am
POD1000000040_S0000438	don't have like with ticket master ticket master can go fuck themselves and nobody will go to the concert
POD1000000040_S0000440	they would go
POD1000000040_S0000442	go do your go make your show somewhere else then because that's the rule they won't if it's last thing we find i guarantee you somebody else will start you know a private ah a private sector of
POD1000000040_S0000443	you know whenever it wheels or think we can fly on on planes and or buses or whatever it is we're just they there'll be cause there is enough people on on the side of question that will that have a if i can enough money to
POD1000000040_S0000444	adapt and pivot to make their own way of entertainment and travel
POD1000000040_S0000445	right
POD1000000040_S0000446	so
POD1000000040_S0000448	we've been on this slippery slope for a number of years now probably twenty-five years where ah political correctness has has robbed of us of our ability to learn how to do conflict resolution particularly the young age
POD1000000040_S0000450	on the face when you're six seven years is a lesson or getting punched in the face
POD1000000040_S0000452	you know what i mean it's not not

POD1000000040_S0000461	that would be a way
POD1000000040_S0000463	cheaper then the fucking seven to eight trillion dollars we're gonna end up spending on this
POD1000000040_S0000465	yeah and and ah back to your thing about the child regression

POD1000000040_S0000658	julian i was like what if like you had a diaper bag that like had a fold-out section that was a table and a i had ardy and i had been hanging out his wife was pregnant and he had called me
POD1000000040_S0000659	this after show this has happened and i was like had a few cocktails and was sketching out on a this like ah napkin and i was like dude there is there's none out there and there's like we didn't want to come up with a bag it was like we we knew that
POD1000000040_S0000661	the moms would still buy it but we wanted it to look where where a dad would carry it because every diaper it had flower prints and sort of stuff so we flew to china did a bunch of prototypes

POD1000000041_S0000239	and we're back let's talk about um some ideas for police reform that are being put forward ah in california there's a bill being disgusts ah that is a kind of incremental lists
POD1000000041_S0000240	um in the way that basically all of the ideas for police reform that are endorsed by um the police are attached to be but ah yeah this one
POD1000000041_S0000241	is basically saying that becoming a cop should require you to have a bachelors degree
POD1000000041_S0000242	and be twenty-five years old just based on statistics about what police officers with those attributes how violent they are nurses otherwise
POD1000000041_S0000243	yeah the legislator who's put newt knows who wrote the bill ah is referring to like this study in twenty-ten that that basically says that ah college educated officers typically typically
POD1000000041_S0000245	typically use less force often and fewer complaints filed against them
POD1000000041_S0000246	now okay that's a good thing to identify that group of people ah but this is you know like we're saying this is incremental change when we know what the real issues are
POD1000000041_S0000247	ah but you know this isn't the issue here and like the reason this bill is coming out isn't because we have a problem with you know not enough cops who studied abroad in barcelona
POD1000000041_S0000249	we have a fucking real issues here this is an issue within policing that is anti black anti poor anti buck and everything ah and they are protected by powerful unions
POD1000000041_S0000250	ah that can keep any kind of real meaningful like legal repercussions from ever you know getting close to them as well as like the financial consequences
POD1000000041_S0000251	ah via these like ridiculous retirement plans a lot of these people have words like dude you get fired and then you're fucking set like no matter what even if you try to murder somebody twice
POD1000000041_S0000252	ah and this is just you know these are the kinds of things that you'd wish the legislators were actually looking at because this is a good way of a legislator being like
POD1000000041_S0000253	well this is an this is an improvement yes that would be great because right now you just need to be i think like eighteen or have a equipped like eighteen with an equivalent in a high school diploma to begin your training
POD1000000041_S0000254	and it can be i think twenty if you're in the california highway patrol but yes this is that a good way to try and weed out other people but it's not really a disingenuous attempt at real reform
POD1000000041_S0000255	and we just need to look at how much money is going to these departments and actually just having this conversation about reinvesting in communities because the perception in law enforcement in this country is
POD1000000041_S0000256	well people commit crime because they're black ah rather than seeing the full picture of how black and brown americans have been abandoned and were merely just branding this failure of governance as crime
POD1000000041_S0000257	you know it's not always crime it's now we failed these people they have no recourse they are so desperate that they commit crime people commit crimes out of desperation
POD1000000041_S0000258	you know night times out and our sergeant would just do for the jollies but let's be real like a lot of this is about survival and you deal drugs cause you get a kick out of dealing drugs you do cause that's only employment available to you
POD1000000041_S0000259	that has the kind of income that you're looking for unfortunately or things other things like that gang don't want to be in gangs like this is all these are all you know fact these are by products of this failure
POD1000000041_S0000260	um and ijust went also point out that this study that the legislator ah is using to say like on yeah look check this out of like you know people who have been to france in college you know ah murder less
POD1000000041_S0000261	ah it was done by the national police foundation which i just wanna point out that they love community policing like solutions and they love putting forward the broken window policing strategy
POD1000000041_S0000262	which is totally fucked up and completely wrong and backwards and biased or so it's already like you know it's what we have an imperfect thing drawing from an imperfect place trying to
POD1000000041_S0000263	you know be presented as you no meaningful change ah so it is i think just i will we will continue to see things like this that look good and are good but i think our avoiding what all the outcries were from the public over the last year
POD1000000041_S0000264	over what is necessary to change the relationship between the community and law enforcement
POD1000000041_S0000265	yeah
POD1000000041_S0000266	yeah i mean i get up i grew up in in the city of chicago ah which is chicago public schools a very diverse schools and all that and i i i can't tell you enough i mean
POD1000000041_S0000267	there are people who i have met and who i have know a little and they're like oh you becoming a cop and my head i'm like who let you become a cop
POD1000000041_S0000269	they're they're allowing
POD1000000041_S0000270	i'm like i'm like what and so i don't there it's like there's so much about character and personality that matters i think with becoming a cop that i don't know what kind of thing you can create
POD1000000041_S0000271	figure that out of how you get the best character and personality to become a cop because it's it's it's it's a humanity job is dealing with people
POD1000000041_S0000273	empathy for people like you need to have empathy for people you need to walk to work for people
POD1000000041_S0000274	i think even to your point about like the character that of you know of the kinds of officers that need to be out there on the street it is i think you start that by just having like reinforcing the fucking rules
POD1000000041_S0000275	ah so the youngs who don't act with humanity in mind are quickly just booted the fuck
POD1000000041_S0000277	known to be was like y'all y'all this isn't the place like if you wanna fuck around and do that go to florida or whatever fuck another you know police department but i think for police department as whole idea like
POD1000000041_S0000278	well couple of bad apples or whatever sect with a tossed out all the fucking bad apples then
POD1000000041_S0000280	and then see what you left with and then figure out what the real problem is but they're like there's no even sort of the energy for that isn't even there so we get all these sort of like half measures that
POD1000000041_S0000281	have the like on paper our police reforms but the we are we are well and we are way past the time for these small things like those things hundred sixty years ago ah if you want like start that little incremental process but
POD1000000041_S0000282	now we're looking at the situation and we need you know we need to extinguish
POD1000000041_S0000284	a a a hundred percent a hundred percent
POD1000000041_S0000285	yeah i mean the more you know about history like that that seems to be something that
POD1000000041_S0000286	like the like it's not just that black communities are abandoned its that they're actively imprisoned through red lining and communities
POD1000000041_S0000287	where the you know official government policy is to deprive them of resources and then they're only interaction with the state like that
POD1000000041_S0000288	ten year old who's riding by on his bike his only interaction with the state is violent racist police like it's it's not a problem that can be addressed through incremental change
POD1000000041_S0000290	what's something from your search history that revealing about who you are
POD1000000041_S0000291	i recently google if ah hamsters can chew on palo santo
POD1000000041_S0000293	like for them and it's is it safe for them
POD1000000041_S0000295	that is almost like silver lake google thing i've ever heard in my life i think if you don't know a palo santo is like if you've ever if wherever you are in the current you have some crunchy friends you're like seemingly just lighting a shard of wood on fire and
POD1000000041_S0000297	the vibe in here is so great ah super producer nick stumpf famously kept his control room just so just piping with ah the palo santo smoke so
POD1000000041_S0000299	is it safe though
POD1000000041_S0000300	there's negative energy it said sage apparently palo santo is cancelled though is what i've heard
POD1000000041_S0000301	palo santo is cancelled
POD1000000041_S0000303	i think like why people like myself who are like can i answer you on it
POD1000000041_S0000305	don't let them have it taking it back no
POD1000000041_S0000307	pretty damn good i think it's smells
POD1000000041_S0000309	for an over sage for sure
POD1000000041_S0000310	okay
POD1000000041_S0000311	yeah
POD1000000041_S0000312	yeah any like place they're selling crystals is like who truly like who truly gave way to sage which gave which gave way to palo santo right now
POD1000000041_S0000314	you know go to your local crystal shop if you don't know that's the price my palo santo in there
POD1000000041_S0000316	okay
POD1000000041_S0000317	i will do that the second or that it i'm gonna make a b line for that the second this ah lockdown is lifted
POD1000000041_S0000318	are like musicians especially love thing that's why nick had it do because i've never been like with
POD1000000041_S0000320	musicians who if you are playing with them or in a session or like a rehearsal where there just like let me just get a polygon a little bit
POD1000000041_S0000322	that's why i it's such a silver lake thing in my mind because like so many rehearsal space is just smell like weed like ah pabst and you know palo santo
POD1000000041_S0000324	alison how are you ah enjoying your palo santo are you like lighting a is just like a stick that light always
POD1000000041_S0000325	is literally it's like do i have it on me no it's literally just like a stick
POD1000000041_S0000326	yeah
POD1000000041_S0000327	yeah it's the most uninteresting thing to see
POD1000000041_S0000329	really good clears negative negative energy and fearing that staffed but i have a pet hamster and he needed a new chew toy and i was like
POD1000000041_S0000330	i'm you know post recovery surgery mode i'm like while i have palo santo like
POD1000000041_S0000332	that leave me alone
POD1000000041_S0000333	yeah like and you summon the entertain yourself with but i ultimately decided not to even i couldn't find a straight answer on palo santo specifically it seemed like it might be too risky of a wood for a hamster
POD1000000041_S0000334	would you pay the two
POD1000000041_S0000335	i ended up just waiting and i ended up just waiting and asked my sister to go to petco for me and she got
POD1000000041_S0000336	there you go
POD1000000041_S0000337	pencil shaped wood chew things
POD1000000041_S0000339	should have experimented with the palo santo may it may be will change the whole vibe of the hamster
POD1000000041_S0000341	so hamster chew toys just just wood is that kind of the
POD1000000041_S0000343	hamster forever so don't get me started but if they are very sneaky fragile creatures and i don't understand why we sell them like until five year olds like that should be not okay
POD1000000041_S0000344	they're actually very high payment animals and even like the titled what they chew is important cause someone is poisonous to them neither what isn't
POD1000000041_S0000346	is bad for them something like that i think he'll gone some and not on others are like some like poisoned i don't know basically so yeah matters what kind of wood did they chew
POD1000000041_S0000348	for the record you know an ounce and is on her stenographer's keyboard right now
POD1000000041_S0000350	finally i want to talk about a story that would have i don't know it's it seems like it's way too important to cover in three minutes which we're gonna try and do but
POD1000000041_S0000352	the former head of israel's ah what what's his official title
POD1000000041_S0000354	these there's no
POD1000000041_S0000355	he's not some guy with a cool twitter handle of that you know bibi net yahoo like fox with it's like you know his his heavy use running from the eighties till like twenty-ten or something
POD1000000041_S0000357	took for a context he's saying if i had come up with what i'm saying today five years ago i will get what he sang i would have been hospitalized wherever i've gone with this in academia they've said the man has lost his mind today
POD1000000041_S0000358	they're already talking differently i have nothing to lose i've received my degrees and an awards i'm respecting universities abroad where the trend is also changing that trend he says that
POD1000000041_S0000359	ah we have made alien contact the u s government and israel in particular ah that we are in communication and in fact in a legal contract ah with the extra terrestrials um
POD1000000041_S0000360	i mean i'm glad of that one of his quotes his i'm glad that though the aliens respect contract law
POD1000000041_S0000362	he said quote there's an agreement between the u s government and the aliens they signed a contract with us to do experiments here
POD1000000041_S0000363	they too are researching and trying to understand the whole fabric of the universe and they want us as helpers
POD1000000041_S0000365	i i just the signed the contract this where goes a little too far i know i was on board agreement maybe
POD1000000041_S0000366	you know contract were they were they red lining did they get the lawyers involved are those are the alien the only legal counsel they're like sorry this and this is actually a poison pill in this deal
POD1000000041_S0000367	we will no do it if it's in it's contained in the contract language i don't um but they're saying one of the first hubs of cooperation is a base on mars where by the way
POD1000000041_S0000368	ah astronauts have already set foot american astronauts and the base's underground that's why i can see
POD1000000041_S0000369	i love i love aliens i love aliens my uncle has a ten thousand dollar telescope in new hampshire and he was shown me jupiter up clothes i've i've said this before i'll say it again if i have a family of six kids
POD1000000041_S0000370	i need to be there for my family and aliens come to me and say hey we'll take you with us you can never come back here see anybody again but you will get to see the galaxy for what it is i'd be like let's go
POD1000000041_S0000372	i would go okay i want prologue that but i will say this guy lost me when he plugged his book
POD1000000041_S0000374	it's like you don't want this guy's book though you know even if like a thing if like if he was talking that real shit he's like you know it's so complex like to say i use the word agreement would completely betray the forms of communication these life forms use
POD1000000041_S0000375	i would be like well okay but when you're treating it like a fucking like just be you know a funny comedy film where they were like hey let's collab on some research graham
POD1000000041_S0000377	and then even like his his explanation is like what what where you all been where the aliens been what's going on
POD1000000041_S0000378	he mentioned trump in there too
POD1000000041_S0000379	yeah he did say that ah trump was on the verge of revealing of this but aliens in the galactic federation thing is literally a term from star trek but maybe not
POD1000000041_S0000380	ah aliens in the galactic federation are saying wait let everyone calm down first they they don't want to start mass hysteria they want to first make a scene and understanding
POD1000000041_S0000381	so here's why i like obviously i want to believe and i'm going to ah always error on the side of the others could be possible the thing about the contract
POD1000000041_S0000382	so when my theories on aliens is that they might end up being a lot more similar to us then we expect them to be because of parallel evolution
POD1000000041_S0000383	in the fact that like when you look in australia at like the wildlife that evolved there and it like looks almost identical to wildlife that evolved independently in the u s it's like
POD1000000041_S0000384	there when you have the conditions of life in two different seemingly different places like they do end up cohering similarly
POD1000000041_S0000385	so i don't know like maybe maybe that is something that eventually always comes up and when there's a civilization that has evolved to a certain point maybe they're like we yet have contracts man
POD1000000041_S0000387	other one then nothing separates us from the single celled organisms please that hadn't come all this way to not have the legal paperwork
POD1000000041_S0000389	but i also just like picturing the process of getting from respected in academic circles has this hugely powerful ah career and now
POD1000000041_S0000390	what makes like just selling books just be i'm like yeah they can just seems i don't know i have i have a hard time
POD1000000041_S0000391	imagining that ah evolution like unless he was always all along like had some suspicion that there was alien contact like
POD1000000041_S0000392	he just keeps his mouth shut cause he's gonna do his job all the time you'll like dude you gotta knock that shit off
POD1000000041_S0000394	and he's just using like the same shit the u f o heads and the u s
POD1000000041_S0000395	don't you say i'm roswell though dog look at this viral video
POD1000000041_S0000397	what about that beam of light above tel aviv that your shot up in the sky what was that guy from multiple angles like that was doctored we already talked about this doctor
POD1000000041_S0000399	i wonder if two like yeah at a certain point you know this is like is like breaking bad like kind of thing was like fuck it i got nothing
POD1000000041_S0000401	and get a book deal and get my little check so i can you know just buy my retirement cabin and then live life comfortably cause my government pension is running out so i got to exploit that position did say some wild alien shit
POD1000000041_S0000402	i don't know that would be a smart move though because instantly right like it's a it's this has been a global headlines because of because of the position he held so it's like
POD1000000041_S0000403	just if so if you just have that former title to give you any authority keep in mind anybody in any position with authority you can do this
POD1000000041_S0000404	come out with some outlandish ship that would just be like up and the general accepted knowledge of your industry and be like what the former head of what's said what put this ah and then people will laugh you out but you get your little shine
POD1000000041_S0000405	yeah so you're you're officially honor the skies ah losted or just trying to sell books shit now
POD1000000041_S0000407	i love the i love the energy of someone who's gonna like completely change the game on us like this and be like no you're not listening they have signed the fucking contract okay and trump almost plucked it all up
POD1000000041_S0000408	and then the aliens were like not found just dead dead for a second because the people are not ready for us to do our grand reveal so if you could just sit on that we would appreciate that and donald trump was like bad
POD1000000041_S0000409	and you know that's basically would our president is he respects the you know agency of
POD1000000041_S0000411	it's like it's also tough that too because we're we're we're like having this conversation is society right now about believing the scientists
POD1000000041_S0000413	like these guys and academic super respected he ran their space programs so this is somebody who we should
POD1000000041_S0000414	buy into right what we should say like guys

POD1000000041_S0000420	what the fuck do you think i was talking about what i said operation warp speed

POD1000000041_S0000446	a hundred dollar burger
POD1000000041_S0000447	this shit needs to be unequivocal this it's this undeniably there has to be this hundred percent u k heritage beef patties seared wagyu sirloin fresh black truffles and truffle pecorino cheese
POD1000000041_S0000448	that i can see the like forty dollars
POD1000000041_S0000449	i don't know why they even why even put a press release out it's gonna anger people like you want to talk about your luxury burger in the time of like the global depression um but

POD1000000041_S0000460	i i worked on the health kitchen shows so i know what else we talk about is it t the ah i i i mean beef wellington seltzer sounds like it's worth a punt
POD1000000041_S0000462	and i hear the ingredients by the way are seltzer natural flavors and hate
POD1000000041_S0000464	the his like his cheesy ass like you know puff promo talk is amazing to quote this is gordon ramsey quote

POD1000000041_S0000495	i don't know this is on that we did this but we we worked at playboy we actually worked at the same time and weren't even friends it's a shame although i didn't i knew of you because everyone was saying she's a comedian i'm like what there's someone funny here get away from there surely
POD1000000041_S0000496	no one taught to me yeah we should have been friends at playboy no one taught to me
POD1000000041_S0000498	were you in a weird part of the office it was a weird time of the country was there that the company was having a bit of trouble figuring out there taxing identity
POD1000000041_S0000499	the non nude age
POD1000000041_S0000501	ah we got to go to the mansion for like staff party
POD1000000041_S0000502	you got to go i didn't
POD1000000041_S0000504	i got terribly drunk and walked into a glass wall
POD1000000041_S0000505	my sister snuck into ah hugh hefner's house on the valentine's day yeah and met his son and they were just hanging in there
POD1000000041_S0000506	corner

POD1000000041_S0000510	taken off with your cake and your health insurance
POD1000000041_S0000512	there so the other the reason i bring it up is because every like six to three to six months
POD1000000041_S0000513	the online store or the playboy magazine online store would just have a free for all of shit nobody wanted and the staff could go and my pick from the bones of like the online store and get like a t shirt or beer cozies
POD1000000041_S0000514	or high heeled sneakers and jamie's case that she so lovingly took um but i just want to say i just point this out because the state department had a holiday party ah on tuesday
POD1000000041_S0000515	or super spreader event whatever the fuck you want to call it but i just want to point out what the gift bags were at the state department holiday party quote is from the washington post reporting of the state department party

POD1000000042_S0000025	success means that you don't have responsibilities anymore
POD1000000042_S0000026	yes for one day one day
POD1000000042_S0000027	jocko would not like that
POD1000000042_S0000028	one day you you are suppose to celebrate for one day i believe
POD1000000042_S0000029	like when you finish your book you've got a new book out called the talent war um when you finish your new book what was the celebration because these things are so goddamn hard to write
POD1000000042_S0000030	i can't express it enough for people like i wanna write a book and i'm i'm always like don't don't do it it is so hard man
POD1000000042_S0000031	if it was the first time i put the crans down and picked up a ah actual pen out but i would rather go back to warn other ten times
POD1000000042_S0000033	it's crazy right
POD1000000042_S0000034	insane
POD1000000042_S0000035	um so tell i'm already the process and what what made you want to write this book it's called the talent war
POD1000000042_S0000036	um you you got a co author here george randle um and and josh cotton as well you put the p h d on them
POD1000000042_S0000037	we of course you have to have the doctor just as justice you know make it official sooner we you know george was a army veteran ah mustang back in the eighties nineties he's been in town acquisition for twenty years
POD1000000042_S0000038	i came out of the ah the seal teams and i started a foundation to help veterans get jobs that totally failed
POD1000000042_S0000039	ah and then we saw the pivoted ah jocularly myself and wife ah to get idea admitted a for profit and so i place that's high performing that's into senior leadership positions in as we're doing this do companies are just bad at hiring
POD1000000042_S0000040	um
POD1000000042_S0000041	they still don't know how to do now it took that blueprint that book just takes us special operations forces have over the past half ah century evolved probably the longest behavioral interview ah in in in how to implement that into your company
POD1000000042_S0000042	and start building teams that
POD1000000042_S0000043	right right but google's not gonna be able to put you ah in the wake do and flutter kicks all day right
POD1000000042_S0000044	so then you gotta find other ways to test people's medal i suppose and and i am curious how haven't read the book yet is there anything in there about that like a non kinetic ways to test
POD1000000042_S0000046	so there there are we don't get into the means as much as the ah at the strategy of having the town mindset but yeah don't don't take your ah candidates down to the surf zone you'll end up in pretty litigious
POD1000000042_S0000047	ah situation
POD1000000042_S0000048	not a good idea
POD1000000042_S0000049	it's it's applying the ad the pressure in the interview process and having a multivariate process from assessments and you there's a lot of things people just don't have interviews well right when you watch george randle
POD1000000042_S0000050	he will apply the pressure so companies sometimes will call us not to hire some of our people but to run interview processes for him and give us our opinion
POD1000000042_S0000051	and he will bring the pain on them you're talking thirty year execs who just
POD1000000042_S0000053	right
POD1000000042_S0000054	um some of them do but the good ones do but even role play i mean you put jocko as big role play guy
POD1000000042_S0000056	it has found that about jocko your folks
POD1000000042_S0000057	loves role play
POD1000000042_S0000059	cut right there
POD1000000042_S0000061	we started the show just to catch people off guard cut half of what they say out leave the rest out and make it a fucking headline
POD1000000042_S0000062	yeah dude so now your book will be chopped up when this comes out it'll say ah
POD1000000042_S0000064	author wrote a book about jocko's ah with role play
POD1000000042_S0000065	yeah we did the tim we did at the tim kennedy yes we like this guy can't stop talking about hitler hitler hitler hitler is obsessed with hitler i mean the show is called finding hitler but i mean
POD1000000042_S0000066	yeah
POD1000000042_S0000067	whatever
POD1000000042_S0000068	yeah
POD1000000042_S0000069	that's not our problem
POD1000000042_S0000070	not a problem not a problem
POD1000000042_S0000071	report the news i hear i was i was duly warned about an honesty so i now now i understand ah jocko i love you ah do not fire me
POD1000000042_S0000073	honey get ready to move
POD1000000042_S0000074	ah ah a real quick speaking of jocko in all sincerity here and he wrote he wrote the forward to your book and before we came on air you work with jocko um how did that come about
POD1000000042_S0000075	so i was in his task unit as a a young seal officer ah i came from the marine corps as a recon marine on the enlisted side um and um bro you talk about good leaders he's as good as they come
POD1000000042_S0000076	because you know every one talks a big game what do we say in texas all
POD1000000042_S0000078	yeah
POD1000000042_S0000079	um he he practices what he preaches and so
POD1000000042_S0000080	then i went on to deploy ah you know in another nine times um but ah you know people already read the buckner like that's the best part of the book
POD1000000042_S0000082	yeah now delegates it's pretty much jacko on this one
POD1000000042_S0000083	somebody asked me yeah they they are like how do you think this book fairs against extreme ownership and i'm like that's like asking ah how does your son who plays basketball in high school fare against ah you know the brown
POD1000000042_S0000084	right right
POD1000000042_S0000085	but i did not have to respond
POD1000000042_S0000087	it's different here's the thing managed ah anybody can be anybody in today's society can be famous over nights
POD1000000042_S0000088	if they get the right avenue right like david goggins is the perfect example going on rogan man i didn't know who that was
POD1000000042_S0000089	and so he went on joe rogan ah jacko i wasn't familiar with cause i'm i'm military iran i'm a civilian ah book but he goes on rogan and crushes and your like are oh great it depends on the opportunities and where you are
POD1000000042_S0000090	um and then you're messaging after it on top of an clearly what you are writing about is extremely important for today's world and helping getting jobs when you come out
POD1000000042_S0000091	um and maybe the show will be the platform for you um for you as a person why was this so important to write
POD1000000042_S0000093	you ah ah i fundamentally the ah the strongest our fortunes nations our economy in and people don't take that seriously you know it is our duty as american citizens to make sure that thing is a strong response because when it is we have everything we need in the military
POD1000000042_S0000094	and and for that coming out if you can find purpose in a lot so many vets nowadays say naughty i didn't i don't know my wide oh no my purpose yeah you've got one purpose get a job make the economy stronger
POD1000000042_S0000095	and and that your duty to the next generation of military leaders dominant
POD1000000042_S0000097	ah ah why do you think it's so hard to get through people's heads of why they should hire military veterans like this is one that i will never understand
POD1000000042_S0000098	it is a lot of misconceptions out there men honestly i mean it's it's how do you translate ah intangible skills and tangible skills when we all know from people that have developed if you're and if you're as a sports coach or as a leader in the military
POD1000000042_S0000100	you know that someone's resume is far less important in their ability to fuck and change on the fly right to absorb information make quick decisions and in turn that information to good decisions
POD1000000042_S0000101	you don't mean at that you can't you can teach people to do as such you can't teach people but people that can do it under extreme duress are few and far between and those are the people you want and those like high level positions
POD1000000042_S0000102	yes or or and even lower level positions like i i don't understand that as well like i got my first taste of an arranged fifteen um when i directed that i was the first time we're most of the people behind the camera were veterans right
POD1000000042_S0000103	they didn't have as much experience as is typical people in hollywood but the work ethic at the outworks any of those lazy assholes like three to one and after that i mean my mind completely changed where elisha subdued
POD1000000042_S0000104	if you're not hiring military veterans to do all the sheets like ah you're missing out on i mean cause it's something you don't have to teach them you don't have to teach them were worth at ethic whatsoever of what like to get up early and work hard on us up like
POD1000000042_S0000105	that's already instilled in everybody that comes out of the military as a civilian my god man is the first fucking people i would hire over any these fucking assholes was like
POD1000000042_S0000106	my dad did this or i got in this or whatever and its like well well great how was i can help my company you know
POD1000000042_S0000107	so the book is not exactly you know an argument for why you should hire veterans ah but as a whole it speaks to you harder for character you hire for attitude you you had hired for mindset
POD1000000042_S0000108	industry experience which is how ninety-nine percent accompanies higher is not a predictor of success it's not just because somebody has five years of marketing ah you know experience doesn't mean they're good at marketing
POD1000000042_S0000109	if you find somebody with all the right attributes and you train him or he just say they will outwork they will outpace those people eventually and and it's frustrating um you know the systemic challenges with veterans and you know were civilians get this
POD1000000042_S0000110	cause with beyonce you know come in out world war two pretty much every one served in the military for the most part and they had they understood
POD1000000042_S0000111	they had to yeah
POD1000000042_S0000112	yeah thence to devalue veterans it's now the one percent versus ninety-nine percent
POD1000000042_S0000113	while minutes its point four five percent actually agree on any specific yes i think i think in the world war two as like fifteen point eight percent to the now point four five percent yeah
POD1000000042_S0000115	right
POD1000000042_S0000116	so it's a different world now obviously
POD1000000042_S0000117	to a ninety-nine point five percent ah their perceptions are based off what they see the movies where hollywood is always gonna be the best recruiting tool for the military it's also its worst enemy when you get out
POD1000000042_S0000118	that's why shows like seal team are so important like they get out all right they don't church up and he the bullshit and it saw it's one thing to be to challenge some of those issues and take him on in a network and environment is tough when you're murdering people basically
POD1000000042_S0000119	but um they get old they get a lot right and all those guys are huge supporters and voters wallets when they got into the program in the first place tyler like it is you know tyler
POD1000000042_S0000120	tylor grey
POD1000000042_S0000121	he's a he's a fucking magnet he is a magnet for good and talented people i don't know what it is about him that makes that happen maybe he's jesus hard to say
POD1000000042_S0000123	it seems like people first of all he's one of the hardest working human beings i've ever met my life he's also brilliant and an operator so it's
POD1000000042_S0000124	people flocked to him to be able to expression like that and i talked to people i i've been on set a couple times i talked to the people that work on that show the been in hollywood for years and they they don't talk about that's the same way that other people out there do
POD1000000042_S0000125	there's there's something different about the way they speak and you can tell that just experience right
POD1000000042_S0000126	like that's old as its experience one on one with a human being that's the reason nobody hates gay people anymore everybody was afraid gay people fifteen years ago and like oh everybody's gay cool no no now no one cares anymore as there is some reticence
POD1000000042_S0000127	um behalf of the general public to deal with with veterans is to deal with them in general right when we're also really bad at asking for help we needed to
POD1000000042_S0000128	so all these things come together and used the the result unfortunately very often is subdued alone and is a part of the fucking gunner and you know what i mean that the to to common standard here and it's it is what it is and we have to educate
POD1000000042_S0000129	at the end of the day that's what spooked us
POD1000000042_S0000130	we were lucky to have served in a tribe really some of the last tribes that exist ah ah in the u s and when you leave environment where all you knew was team and esprit de corp
POD1000000042_S0000131	it's hard to come back especially when you see the leadership the national capital region where we expect our leadership to be the best and we get the exact opposite they can even work with you know together with some civility
POD1000000042_S0000132	when you come back from a military environment and you're like what the hell is going on
POD1000000042_S0000133	very disappointing we've got the best military that you could possibly have we have the best idea the best fundamental idea that any countries based on
POD1000000042_S0000134	and i think it's two parts one is individual liberty in the other part is what an okay said you have to answer reason when to pull yourself up and the pole the next gap with you
POD1000000042_S0000135	those are the two fundamental and fundamental guiding principles of most americans lives i hope but somehow we end up every single year with the shadiest possible leaders like what what does they say about american culture that we're not able to put people in
POD1000000042_S0000137	i think maybe the presumption that everybody's on the same page as a dangerous presumption because clearly that a lot of fucking ah snakes out there and we've we've put that part of our brain and hold because our lives are busy
POD1000000042_S0000138	but it might be time to start paying a little bit of attention to what's going on in politics again not just fucking read sharing stupid shit on facebook but actually pay attention to who seeing what how foolish at both these parties are
POD1000000042_S0000139	and how they're basically just fucking using you to get what they want i think it's really important for people to fucking turn inward and start looking at themselves and how they've allowed the shit to happen because we have to prevent it from continuing we have to stop it in its tracks
POD1000000042_S0000140	we have just prevented from having a gun as well like we're we're not learning a lessons right now everybody's
POD1000000042_S0000142	it's fucking stupid
POD1000000042_S0000143	if you don't take an interest in politics politics will surely take an interest in you and i think a lot of people are now seeing that and that the the amount of people that don't get out though is is i don't know if i want to say disgusting
POD1000000042_S0000144	but you that is your civic duty to get out though and you know when you think people are gonna wake up they're gonna start ah getting a lot more involved in
POD1000000042_S0000145	quite frankly veterans
POD1000000042_S0000146	hmm
POD1000000042_S0000147	we need more veterans like dan crenshaw
POD1000000042_S0000148	right
POD1000000042_S0000149	ah in there ah with you know dan has shown the ability to reach across island have a civil conversation yet that guy's definitely the candidate for twenty twenty-four i i don't doubt that one bit
POD1000000042_S0000150	maybe you're probably right as
POD1000000042_S0000151	maybe his own party in their ah in their in their fucking deep but hurt state that therein right now we don't even notice over yet by the way but in their deep but hurt state
POD1000000042_S0000152	they're gonna lash out at anybody that gives anything talk towards the middle and that is the fucking dumb as shit of all time if you will make yourself truly irrelevant become the tea party start to shout
POD1000000042_S0000153	thou shalt not our ah shall not infringe over and over until your ears bleed and their ways like all right well we learned the lesson that and anymore
POD1000000042_S0000154	right
POD1000000042_S0000155	if if you think you can go play this game whatever the game is without negotiating and taking other people's it's not about giving up ground it's about taking other people's lives and can and and circumstances and the fucking ah mind
POD1000000042_S0000156	when you're making decisions that's a good that's a trait of a good human being to do that by the way it doesn't doesn't make you weak to consider the feelings and plight of other people
POD1000000042_S0000157	how how can that possibly true because the strongest people we know take that thing into consideration the go fight and die for it doesn't make any goddamn sense
POD1000000042_S0000158	but somehow he replied that politically where you know it's it's somehow perceived as a weakness or disloyal to agree with the fact like nowadays this is information this is
POD1000000042_S0000160	here just get out of here without stop or we can't do it i don't know why i don't know why
POD1000000042_S0000161	i don't either and since speaking a politics did you did you feel like you had a political hangover today when you got up and started the day like he's now it looks if it's monday were recording us on monday
POD1000000042_S0000162	you wake up you you you walk the streets you get to talk to people or see people's expressions ah which you're feeling today
POD1000000042_S0000163	well so my wife in our downtown ah on saturday shortly after they made the ah the ah the announcement and people drive around hearken and and great you know i understand that they're happy for the the their side
POD1000000042_S0000164	but the biggest realization for me when i i feel like something's coming
POD1000000042_S0000165	ah the publicans are are are are like lain in wait but they got some they are just they just eerie feeling but my whole take away from this as one people need to be just so less polarized
POD1000000042_S0000166	and and so less emotional and and i know that's mainly to left but federal government has become way too freaking big
POD1000000042_S0000167	and that's what needs to change it needs be pushed down the state and local level as it was always intended and it will put less emphasis on federal government if we end up doing that
POD1000000042_S0000168	how you mean like the tenth amendment says to
POD1000000042_S0000169	yeah
POD1000000042_S0000170	i mean you know it was one of the bell of goddamn rights maybe we should take it seriously or we to do whatever who cares
POD1000000042_S0000171	if the if the liberal party libertarian party was so messed up ah
POD1000000042_S0000172	i mean the ideas haven't been fleshed out they're too they're too young their economic policies are nonsense and not because they know what is gonna take him seriously you have to have something that is applicable
POD1000000042_S0000173	and scale are not just a good idea to its we're in twenty twenty now you can't say like you know what would be great is if this like yet would be great but that sounds like a reality
POD1000000042_S0000174	you also need a popular candidate

POD1000000042_S0000188	either way man you don't turn down ten point three million listeners right you try to get your message out there despite whatever it is because it's hard to go out to an audience of the size um anywhere right now

POD1000000042_S0000190	we're gonna start voting for this we're gonna start taking this party seriously regardless of it takes votes away from one or the other is that it's always been one of the biggest arguments that's right is somebody s been afraid to run down the middle with
POD1000000042_S0000192	it's gonna take votes from this other candidate or you you you have to stop being afraid of that um yes you're gonna take votes from another candidate but to know in order to establish a serious third party
POD1000000042_S0000193	someone's got started and and it's got to be serious um and and then there's got to be some financial backing as they didn't have that much money there
POD1000000042_S0000194	no ross perot to pay for himself
POD1000000042_S0000195	yes

POD1000000042_S0000197	hmm
POD1000000042_S0000198	look this isn't about a versus b this is about what the fuck is best for my goddamn country right what is all this happening right now that made this worse all the fucking blood has been shed to make this happen
POD1000000042_S0000199	like we had this idea that individual liberty is really important and we think we can govern our entire lives around it and we sent men to battle for four years over and over

POD1000000042_S0000230	after work just to come and catch up on the news ah this was the first day that wasn't dominated by madness over trump and no anger over trump and everything else
POD1000000042_S0000231	they almost did know what to talk about on the new you know um and it was a a couple things like hey that was at this celebration of biden and harrison
POD1000000042_S0000233	they seem loss when they couldn't talk about anything regarding trump
POD1000000042_S0000234	we already know what the riots talk about for the next four years right
POD1000000042_S0000235	no that that's i i was trying to guess that earlier on
POD1000000042_S0000237	revolution what is it what are they going to talk about
POD1000000042_S0000238	provided things stay as they are with these counts um was gonna talk about is how the republicans are trying to prosecute biden forward that russia bullshit which is hilarious by the way i mean
POD1000000042_S0000240	something different
POD1000000042_S0000241	for now for that buckeyes involvement in which we know he answered with it don't don't be naive let's let's be adults here
POD1000000042_S0000242	yeah the big guy
POD1000000042_S0000243	i don't i don't we'll we'll see about we will see it probably is admitted it it definitely pass the smell test and we know that those e-mails are are legit now not not necessarily don't know that biden's the big guy necessarily we know those e-mails of legit
POD1000000042_S0000244	anyways ah when we hear about that cars are holding to control you that you are there also going to probably win the house in the midterm the republicans probably will
POD1000000042_S0000245	in twenty twenty two
POD1000000042_S0000246	because there's things are too tumultuous right now for biden to maintain like a positive he is gonna be a lot of war going on with the democratic
POD1000000042_S0000248	and everybody right now
POD1000000042_S0000249	and tiff was burned down the guardian portland d n c headquarters and rode at such a profane shit would bind name on it
POD1000000042_S0000250	why he wasn't he wasn't progressive
POD1000000042_S0000251	he let the inmates run the asylum the democratic party will fracture
POD1000000042_S0000252	yeah it's gonna fracture so they're gonna be in in twenty twenty-two the republicans will win back the house and its bucking bulls on parade at that point right they are gonna be lining him up with on everything they can
POD1000000042_S0000253	for the next two years and then c n n and m s n b c will be defending biden the same way the fox has been defending trump except for when they haven't right
POD1000000042_S0000254	all right it's it's nonsense it's it's like a play it's like ah it's it's
POD1000000042_S0000256	all right yeah yeah yeah
POD1000000042_S0000257	from ah what is called
POD1000000042_S0000258	the price's right they now sell it for a home version by the way if you're curious they do
POD1000000042_S0000260	no question which line its gonna go down and get me a very little bed but it's gonna go down to one general area you know what every single time this is where we're fucking dummies we're in the best country that could possibly exist right
POD1000000042_S0000261	right
POD1000000042_S0000262	because of our geographical stand off because the idea that we built the country on individual liberty we have the best opportunity in this country to stave off any kind of attack
POD1000000042_S0000263	while also flourishing as much as as as a culture can but you know we do nothing we're idiots we we start to see some succession like i deserve this like a few a few achieve something
POD1000000042_S0000265	there's a reason why all these dumb dumbs when they win awards get up on stage look at us like to thank everybody involved in this now because they really believe it because they probably don't let's be real but that is exactly how your brain should work your brain should once you accomplish something
POD1000000042_S0000266	even the smallest thing during the day with oh fucking i was great starting at about what allowed you the opportunity to do that stuff now because you didn't work hard it's not because of that because everybody's fucking work and hard doesn't make you special work hard okay
POD1000000042_S0000267	and makes you doing the bare minimum frankly so yeah i did this great thing and work today you know it was really great as when i didn't have to worry about shit at home because my wife and had already taken care of or whatever the case is right
POD1000000042_S0000268	that's a big fucking mental leap to make as a human being and if you can start to implement should like that your real life at the you'd i goddamn happier
POD1000000042_S0000269	the guy i i work on that it's easier to talk about is very difficult to do that shit real time because you're so much in your own head but you don't think about at the time and intensely like baucus have said this right
POD1000000042_S0000270	i i i'm i'm lucky cause i think for me personally at least in my relationship in my home life um i enjoy my wife and i enjoy my children um a lot
POD1000000042_S0000271	so when i go home i i don't have an issue of like holy shit i've got a fire on the news or get angry about anything like i don't exactly love my family in its real right ah i don't wanna people who don't
POD1000000042_S0000272	and that one of them fortunately so i don't have those issues and problems but everybody else who is i think they use politics and everything else is a crutch of like while this is why my life sucks in anything
POD1000000042_S0000273	yeah it's not it's not heart attack now and an earlier day and think about what you should be grateful for it and then maybe if its people go show some gratitude it's not it doesn't take a whole lot of time to do either one will say that something that i'm a dude that lives in my own had quite a bit i'm heady
POD1000000042_S0000274	which is an annoying thing to say but it's true i fucking second round the stared and think for forty-five minutes and people think i'm nuts right or i walk around and people are standing around me some time even if it's at my home
POD1000000042_S0000275	hmm
POD1000000042_S0000276	um and that's off putting to people like you can't just act like that now so i know i'm hetty and should i think about the stuff a lot but it does trap me up like i get caught in that moment
POD1000000042_S0000277	where i'm just like hmm let me think about everything that's going on right now no you should i gotta you gotta train yourself right twenty-one days it takes them to train something into your daily routine that will last forever
POD1000000042_S0000278	twenty-one days typically speak for a normal person so southern heart adieu to surmount have ever right and strategy i think we're all feeling out i pretty much everybody i know feels the shit
POD1000000042_S0000279	but how do we how do we enjoy what's happening in real time instead of being nostalgic later cause this is the only time we've got this this resource of time is the only one that we can replace
POD1000000042_S0000280	ah and i'll say this and that is the only thing that i have figured out in this life and i figured out in a very very early age that time um was the most valuable thing that we have
POD1000000042_S0000281	so i i consider myself good at that but batted other things um i don't know about you
POD1000000042_S0000283	i'm not gonna give bandwidth things i can't change or effect ah i am just over and at the end of the day you know jocose said this is like you people get so worked up that trumps can elected while he may be moves the as myth like two degrees to the right
POD1000000042_S0000284	biden gets elected yeah may be four degrees to the left or we still moving in the same general direction
POD1000000042_S0000285	yeah
POD1000000042_S0000286	it's like you dugout forensics i went to u t ah that when they lose a game it's like their whole week is destroying
POD1000000042_S0000287	or they've had a rough couple weeks
POD1000000042_S0000288	ah they had they had a rough fifteen years
POD1000000042_S0000289	shrug your shoulders you're not in the flagon you're an alumni and just move on with your ah your your day
POD1000000042_S0000290	that's one thing about about i'll admit that yeah i'm terrible dude i went to hire state so i'm fucking terrible
POD1000000042_S0000291	when will you guys usually dominate
POD1000000042_S0000292	i know
POD1000000042_S0000293	yeah i but but you don't dominate
POD1000000042_S0000294	that will that will eat away at me for ever and like that's something i'm terrible i now fully admit that
POD1000000042_S0000295	i wonder what what the what are we getting out of that exactly like i'm a fan of various sports teams what do what do i personally get out of them winning
POD1000000042_S0000296	ah so meet me personally
POD1000000042_S0000297	say by the way and because what we lose when they lose
POD1000000042_S0000298	right and or is is it is there commensurate right cause i don't actually lose anything
POD1000000042_S0000299	well you was you was a personally amen
POD1000000042_S0000300	maybe maybe i gain some endorphin you know being being shot at in my brain
POD1000000042_S0000301	yeah
POD1000000042_S0000302	for some period of time maybe it makes me happier but there's probably other ways to accomplish that but i don't get so emotionally invested in and should i can't control i guess maybe as to your point right like their stuff that i can do to have that endorphin release for example cocaine
POD1000000042_S0000304	i know you are waiting for me or stops and said cocaine and it's the reason you're gonna say it is because fuck fucking true
POD1000000042_S0000306	cocaine and m d m a and you can have that same endorphin release without doing show what happened on saturday is is not a fact you probably won't be awake for the game
POD1000000042_S0000308	you'll be out of friday night
POD1000000042_S0000309	be due to wake to the game
POD1000000042_S0000310	i'm go to well i mean if you stayed up all night the i prior was my my joking
POD1000000042_S0000311	so here is like i i don't do cocaine therefore i i have to to live on sports or something so
POD1000000042_S0000312	but it's a drug right i mean you like you to his point over the resend went on that whole fuck is only the echo here because his point we give so much power over us our daily mood to shut that we literally can't control how stupid is that
POD1000000042_S0000313	that's like canada fucking loaded gun to salt to a crazy person dislike i will see what happens they are unique as you literally have no control over whether or not ohio state wins
POD1000000042_S0000314	you also have no control over them vast majority the shit that happens your life where you have control over those the real question and i'm not asking rhetorically i wanna know you think about that
POD1000000042_S0000315	time ah to me it's time i don't know what it is to you but said time and i've always been very my voices i'm impatient and then i will credit i gotta get through this line are yet to get through this whatever because my time is so valuable
POD1000000042_S0000316	and i realized that you can't that is the one thing you just cannot get back that that's why i'm impatient that it's not the other stuff i just don't wanna wait in line or just don't wanna do this i just value my time that much um i don't know what yours is
POD1000000042_S0000317	i i i think why i'm so respect for people's time and i won't ask for a lot to help cause i i i don't want to take up their time um i my time is is is very important to me um it sometime like build brutal bout ah you you look
POD1000000042_S0000318	don't don't waste my time cause i'm not gonna waste yours but when we put to in in the context you know leaving after twenty years ah between you know
POD1000000042_S0000320	lost a lot of brothers
POD1000000042_S0000321	and i'd like just dominated my life for like three years during the transition and there's the you know
POD1000000042_S0000322	thinking about them
POD1000000042_S0000323	thinking about them thinking about everything think think about how the war was fought and how i just totally disagree with the evolution of that more i mean it was mister sharif
POD1000000042_S0000324	it was vietnam two point oh man come on
POD1000000042_S0000325	in in the fact that they're still young eighteen year old in afghanistan
POD1000000042_S0000326	yeah
POD1000000042_S0000327	by just it gets me but there was a point to where and this is why why did you leave the military got him around i've got a strong core of like seals runner ah there's like four of us were boys we just don't talk about the military stuff anymore
POD1000000042_S0000328	cause we don't want to eat any more bandwidth we all gave twenty-four we're done we're pushing behind in in our job is to live now for the gazette in comp come home live in their absence in living memory memory
POD1000000042_S0000329	but that sort of you know when you asking to contextualize it that's immediately with jumps in my my mind
POD1000000042_S0000330	let me let me ask you you guys this question ah because you both seem to be around the same age and you both served you both overseas looking back at it now right all these years later
POD1000000042_S0000332	would you have gone back if you could have you know talk to yourself at that age when you entered ah knowing what you know now would you have done in both of you
POD1000000042_S0000333	yes
POD1000000042_S0000334	same with you yeah
POD1000000042_S0000335	but because gods we're wanna go yeah gods we're gonna go i was gonna be there with me and quite frankly you join i'm sure is the same for you joined because you love your country
POD1000000042_S0000336	right
POD1000000042_S0000337	and you know the only thing necessary for evil is for good men stand by and do nothing then of that quote but it becomes less about the united states because you you get older
POD1000000042_S0000338	you you see that i hate to say that the civilian populace is not as great force as they should be
POD1000000042_S0000339	sure
POD1000000042_S0000340	um and i don't need a pat on the back i don't but for my guys i wanted them to be respected and the remainder of your deployments come about is just about the guys in the team
POD1000000042_S0000341	so the anger then is your anger once you got out you think about that you said vietnam to point out is it towards the government and of like hey guys why the fuck didn't you have this figured out before you send us over there
POD1000000042_S0000342	i would say more so than anybody that was a member of the government at that time the generals and i said this a couple weeks ago too
POD1000000042_S0000343	these motherfuckers knew and they knew they were fucking vietnam survivors if you are caught that all these general officers around they know this bullshit they knew the thing with a at least as bullshit with afghanistan that's a strategical move i thought was inappropriate but it is what it is
POD1000000042_S0000344	um that's the mission creep that should happens but with a rock that was all nonsense that was a dick cheney that's all that was dick cheney's trying to get rich that's all this or had some fucking thing against saddam hussein
POD1000000042_S0000345	ah or or whatever the fuck right i mean he it's funny how cheney and and that other turd was the second theft under bush which is then um i can see a stupid face in my head with a congress move for anyways
POD1000000042_S0000347	rumsfeld ah don rumsfeld
POD1000000042_S0000348	yeah he those guys you can see them shaking hands with ah with saddam back in the day known we are selling them weapons and shell all of a sudden now they're against them
POD1000000042_S0000349	because of what changed between the mid eighties and the early two thousand with the rack exactly what change nothing is the answer ah so yeah i mean there's anger to be spread around but i think the general's bear the the the biggest part of that burden
POD1000000042_S0000350	ah because they had the authority they may look it's different twenty twenty than it was in two thousand right so generals back then wouldn't have jumped on twitter and like hey this guy is an asshole we shouldn't be deploying whatever the fuck
POD1000000042_S0000351	maybe that's a good thing that they didn't do that but they were the most authoritative people on something that they knew would become mission creep like we're just gonna go on and stabilize unlike any time any place any anytime anybody during a military operation says
POD1000000042_S0000352	we're just gonna dot dot dot go ahead and fuck and set your shit on fire cause not coming back to me and it's it's the dumbest shit of all time
POD1000000042_S0000354	but i'm i'm not i wouldn't say i'm really angry justice as more disappointment than anger but you can't be angry for that a lot
POD1000000042_S0000355	that's good cause i i i looked ravishing we have a bunch of friends who are in the military um between us in said there is some some people are just pissed he's angry of like man i i did not i thought i was doing something that i was eyed about

POD1000000042_S0000471	i mean i think it's over right i mean the collections over that this one is over like it's i i just hoped the republicans don't make the same ah mistake that i feel like the democrats did over the last four years and just try to find out mistakes and i hope this isn't there their tagline
POD1000000042_S0000472	like russia was the last four years i hope dead you know look i i do think we need to do do justice to make sure that you know that the system was you know that it was fair
POD1000000042_S0000473	um
POD1000000042_S0000474	but if they like okay pay ah we lost we just need to say it okay we lost we got we got be
POD1000000042_S0000475	right
POD1000000042_S0000476	um we'll go back to drawing board like this don't make this don't play the victim card or the next four years right like
POD1000000042_S0000477	that kind of begs the question what is the point of all this right is the point for your team to win or is the point for america to win that's why i challenge the binary political system itself we've turned
POD1000000042_S0000478	republican talking points versus left hugging or ah liberal talking points into when versus lose or win versus lose depending on how you see the world right that's ridiculous
POD1000000042_S0000479	theirs their right and wrong answers to questions and we've somehow manner manage to pigeon hole ourselves into one of two choices and every fucking year people complain about it
POD1000000042_S0000480	can you believe we got to choose between these two assholes again it's because of you
POD1000000042_S0000481	yeah
POD1000000042_S0000482	every bit of it is because of you because of you you me every all we're all assholes
POD1000000042_S0000483	but but i mean yeah i mean i think our systemi i think this is probably that the danger of a democracy right like there there's a danger to it like you it's kind like a gun
POD1000000042_S0000484	it can be a very very powerful tool it can feed your family protect your family it can literally be used for a lot of things right but it can also be the same thing that kills your entire family right in the wrong hands
POD1000000042_S0000485	and not used with integrity and not knowing the system being very familiar with the tool and all these things and what i think the problem is right now is that we've got a bunch of people who are educated on how our system works
POD1000000042_S0000486	who are educated on on and and the people who are going in there putting into power they're using this in some reality t v show like they're betting on on sunday night football right it's it's done with the same mindset
POD1000000042_S0000487	and and what happens is as with democracy can be the best tool to give us the freest country on the face the planet but it can be a system that implodes on itself and turns everybody against each other because there is so much freedom right
POD1000000042_S0000488	com communism is a more systematic bureaucratic approach to something right like it's it's it's it's regulated it's kind like the military communism is is kind like how the military could be right
POD1000000042_S0000489	our socialism socialism is the military socialism right pretty much socialism but when you have democracy you have all this freedom and all this power you put in the wrong hands
POD1000000042_S0000490	it can be the same the same thing that makes you free can also be the same thing that kills us
POD1000000042_S0000491	right it can and i mean that's why ah there will never be as a a successful socialist country ever is because it inevitably turns to communism now what we found about free market capitalism in things like that is again thrive pretty well
POD1000000042_S0000492	without that happening without turning to fascism for example which is a far right ideology but for some i don't know if it's a corrective measure that society's taken or whatever or people is weak
POD1000000042_S0000493	but it seems like the idea of individual responsibility has gone by the wayside for the most part
POD1000000042_S0000494	but there is no
POD1000000042_S0000495	right
POD1000000042_S0000496	there is no accountability
POD1000000042_S0000497	right so we we you you you are afforded in america you're afforded the privilege it's not a right cause people had to fight for the shit as a privilege yeah you are afforded the privilege of being able to live in a society like capitalism
POD1000000042_S0000498	without the bullshit from a society like socialism or communism where people are telling you what to do all the time that's what this is supposed to be but if you continue to not pay attention to what's going on
POD1000000042_S0000499	and to allow these what seem like simple comforts and your life at the time or maybe they're not bad enough to really go after
POD1000000042_S0000500	we have to focus on the goal of making sure that individual liberty is the most important a well respected facet of our entire system right otherwise we're fucked
POD1000000042_S0000501	but but but look look this this is what you're seeing across the board right now in our politics and and and across the world are ink across the board of america um is the repercussions
POD1000000042_S0000502	ah taking the easy route look at the look at the bigger the baby boomers there there there were the prime when the first generations that decide to become the victims
POD1000000042_S0000503	hmm
POD1000000042_S0000504	a greater desire
POD1000000042_S0000505	i mean there's there's something about culture that when when you become protected you start looking any bird
POD1000000042_S0000506	exactly and and so like they started they started that mindset and now their children started getting participation trophies right and now you look at the whole society that's voting right now
POD1000000042_S0000507	nobody wants to look in the mirror and say you know what i fucking law so i need to go back and work on something
POD1000000042_S0000508	right now we're a bunch a dull blades
POD1000000042_S0000509	we're bunch a dull blades
POD1000000042_S0000510	basically we've never seen steel before we've never been sharp
POD1000000042_S0000511	but but on the backside of it oh the the military that we have in the first responder community that we have is second to none and its provided the same like we have empowered the problem
POD1000000042_S0000512	right because we've had men and women who've been willing to raise their right hands and didn't have to ah we've had people willing to go out and and protect our society and still stand up
POD1000000042_S0000513	when it's not you know a popular in the court of public opinion people still been willing to do this and they are we're basically enabling this behavior to continue right we we got police protecting the same people who are saying fuck the police
POD1000000042_S0000514	right
POD1000000042_S0000515	you don't mean and and so
POD1000000042_S0000516	and there's no social cost to be paid
POD1000000042_S0000518	for that which is that is a problem
POD1000000042_S0000519	and the problem is is when there are no consequences to your actions and i blame eighty percent of this on one one piece of america
POD1000000042_S0000520	and that's big tech
POD1000000042_S0000522	big tech

POD1000000042_S0000534	what what they're doing it now currently now on videos on youtube and it keeps getting scarier and scarier where just like what the fuck is next
POD1000000042_S0000535	well here's what i don't like i don't why when any kind of private organization and look we will support private business here but we have to be fucking pragmatism as well when any private organization gets that powerful than their voice becomes louder than yours
POD1000000042_S0000536	and when their voice becomes louder the government has two choices to listen to that voice or to develop a louder voice themselves in the only way the government develops a louder voices by taking voice away from the people in both these cases
POD1000000042_S0000537	hmm
POD1000000042_S0000538	there is no good solution
POD1000000042_S0000539	but but i don't know there is i'm i disagree there is a good solution with big tech if i go buy a gun a gun has to be registered to somebody's name
POD1000000042_S0000540	right
POD1000000042_S0000541	it has to be
POD1000000042_S0000542	yes
POD1000000042_S0000543	right so if i'm gonna go and create an account on social media and uses platform that can be used to to emotionally charged people and to to to to mass you know gather people to do something for a cause
POD1000000042_S0000544	that should have to be registered to somebody's name because why is that gun registered to somebody's name to hold them accountable
POD1000000042_S0000545	where you where you are describing as biscuit the telephones were which is a public utility thing it makes sense people you hear the word register and that does not set well with a lot
POD1000000042_S0000546	okay okay so it it dyke
POD1000000042_S0000547	because how much how much power do we want the government to have do we not do we not want the capability to communicate with each other and honestly allow the internet is we have to have that
POD1000000042_S0000548	that's not what i'm saying now that's not that is not what i'm saying i'm not saying the government has to be the one
POD1000000042_S0000549	right but who would be then
POD1000000042_S0000550	what you know what if big tech if i'm going to create a platform in and and it's gonna be my platform then if if this account breaks the law
POD1000000042_S0000551	like they break the law that we already have set toward speech if i look at you and i say hey ross i'm gonna kill you you can go call the cops right now and i'm going to jail because you have proof of it
POD1000000042_S0000552	right
POD1000000042_S0000553	right so the same thing should be with the the same should is is like as text messages should be the same thing with social media sites that if something is said that breaks the law there should be no censorship decided from a private party
POD1000000042_S0000554	if this account breaks the law then guess what i come to use your big tech all you are the vault and had verified these people that's your responsibility as far as it goes the censorship
POD1000000042_S0000555	and i come to here and say whose account registered to and then that person is held accountable for breaking the law
POD1000000042_S0000556	so instead of what a section to thirty does which is basically absolve people of our resolve tech companies of any illegal activity outside their purview that may have happened on their platform
POD1000000042_S0000557	you would recommend something like ah the tech companies just being complicit our compliant rather with the government prosecuting case i understand that a principle
POD1000000042_S0000558	absolutely
POD1000000042_S0000559	but imagine a government where a o c is in charge and she's making lists of people who supported trump of
POD1000000042_S0000560	doing its own but its own but i'm saying it's but i'm saying it's already
POD1000000042_S0000561	i and i know i gotta i'm just display and devils avocado here because ah
POD1000000042_S0000562	well then i then i goes back to the american people voting and people they can trust and have that power
POD1000000042_S0000563	yeah but when have we done that who's the last fucking president that you trust
POD1000000042_S0000564	then what we do
POD1000000042_S0000565	i don't know that's been a question i think we need an overhaul the entire look for
POD1000000042_S0000566	well i mean i think i think more the bigger problem to all this is that the fact that honestly this president's not gonna change minds our our our three lives this present that gonna make any decisions that can affect my life or change what i do every single day
POD1000000042_S0000567	it's gonna have absolutely i i don't invest in stocks so i i don't give a shit about that i'll i'll bet i'll gamble my money i'll go and i'll invested in property or i'll do like that so that's gonna be on my performance
POD1000000042_S0000568	like this this president is not gonna affect its gonna effect absolutely nothing of the future for me
POD1000000042_S0000569	yeah and i've i've said this a a bunches times in the past where you know if you heated over president right um and in it affects your life day-to-day chances are you get bigger problems right
POD1000000042_S0000570	because look
POD1000000042_S0000571	you pray living off the government
POD1000000042_S0000572	why you say this
POD1000000042_S0000573	like let's think about our position specifically we're all business owners got right if i decide to sell my business today then i pay fifteen percent capital gains tax on in the rest as mine
POD1000000042_S0000574	right right
POD1000000042_S0000576	and for a month is a decent chance at least thats gonna be twenty-three percent
POD1000000042_S0000577	yes
POD1000000042_S0000578	right
POD1000000042_S0000579	yes
POD1000000042_S0000580	that affects my life
POD1000000042_S0000581	it does um but when i mean the idea that biden and his team are currently floating the idea that they're gonna make mask wearing mandatory nationwide
POD1000000042_S0000582	i mean idea
POD1000000042_S0000583	not that they have the constitutional authority to do anything like that or the fact that they're talking about then yeah i mean
POD1000000042_S0000584	it's already there
POD1000000042_S0000585	you can say whatever the fuck you whine about trump and how he sounds dictatorial some times because he's at he's just an idiot it's negotiating in public and doesn't realize the way to the words he says that doesn't make it right
POD1000000042_S0000586	but it does shed some light on why he would do something like that he's not doing those things to be malicious he's doing it because he's a fucking emotional child and that's how we learn to negotiate over the years and some times is pretty goddamn effect it frankly but even if it wasn't
POD1000000042_S0000587	it's just that it's a strategy it's not it's not who he is at the corners of his person
POD1000000042_S0000588	so when i see people with the core of their character are arguing for the certain things like i want to be the champion of of social justice now despite the fact that i wrote the bill
POD1000000042_S0000589	that put all these men in prison and that my fucking vice president ah ah enforce that bill at the end the biggest state in the country and suppressed evidence to keep people present things like that
POD1000000042_S0000590	that should be o o and awakening right
POD1000000042_S0000591	yeah but but see your point it hasn't happened yet
POD1000000042_S0000592	no i don't think it will
POD1000000042_S0000594	after after a hill after hillary losing maybe there was some chance of biden at last year that that would have happened but now the biden one we're looking at another probably twenty years of his constant
POD1000000042_S0000595	no
POD1000000042_S0000596	fracture of the democratic party
POD1000000042_S0000597	oh yeah yeah yeah i mean look i mean look the democrats lost it it no matter how you look at it right they all they lost seats in the house um i mean that you know if the democrats don't go back and say ah you know
POD1000000042_S0000598	we barely like like donald trump got beat we didn't win ah car like the republicans probably should have done as well last you know last time um
POD1000000042_S0000599	i mean both of them have got to have a a major overhaul but but here's what i got to tell you is
POD1000000042_S0000600	but our republicans did do they came back out of losing to obama for a second time with mitt against mitt romney and they came out with donald trump and won
POD1000000042_S0000601	why so so so i i gotcha
POD1000000042_S0000602	they they made the adjustment
POD1000000042_S0000603	but i also think that was an accident i also think that was as much i i i
POD1000000042_S0000604	i don't think givenchy want that happen
POD1000000042_S0000605	no they definitely do not want that happen yeah
POD1000000042_S0000606	but but so my my thing to you is it is okay let's say we soon as whatever happens in the judicial system comes out and and decide to every prison is either way
POD1000000042_S0000607	if it is joe biden which i i actually believe at this point it's the election's over um we have got to stop talking about what they've done before
POD1000000042_S0000608	and we've just got to hope for the the the hope for the goodness of this nation they they come out and have learned from the mistakes and they're gonna do better over the next four years
POD1000000042_S0000609	that's all we can do like if we don't do that then we are just as bad as the left like we're just as bad as that you don't mean like we've got a hope that
POD1000000042_S0000610	well how do you how do you balance that how do you decide what to support what not to support for example
POD1000000042_S0000611	well how do you how do you pick how do you decide like what you know how you decide like when donald trump does some i mean you gonna forgive him for the shit
POD1000000042_S0000612	now i now i got all that yeah for sure but like how do you what what's the line here if if then if the democrats if the democrats win
POD1000000042_S0000613	and which which it seems to be the case we'll see how much voter fraud we know there's a lot of voter fraud we don't know how much an earth it'll be ah enough to swing anything but anyways it seems like they're gonna win if they win
POD1000000042_S0000614	um there are things that these guys have talked about that are untenable for the american economy
POD1000000042_S0000615	you are right
POD1000000042_S0000616	shutting down i'm not a fan of fracking i'm not a fan of long oil pipelines because the present unnecessary environmental challenges that to me is laziness we could figure out a better way to do it which is how do we put the effort towards we put the effort towards
POD1000000042_S0000617	and money towards nonsensical fucking energy ah substitution that are not feasible does in time we have to figure out better ways to do what we're doing already we're just trying to find out new ways which is stupid anyways
POD1000000042_S0000618	aside from stuff like that the green new deal that that commonly harris was a co author of brine that biden says oh no no no but look he's supported in theory right in the past
POD1000000042_S0000619	and and ah all this other stuff that's come with a party i want the country to succeed so and this is this is a good learning lesson for conservatives right now
POD1000000042_S0000620	because from the perspective of a liberal democrat in twenty sixteen in november of last of twenty sixteen they have a set of core beliefs that they think are gonna make this country the best they could be
POD1000000042_S0000622	trump was the complete opposite of that in their response was to just lose their fucking minds right now that isn't always the case so let's say you ride a train through the city
POD1000000042_S0000623	like you're on the wrong line but then you look at the map we can go up to more and then swap or
POD1000000042_S0000624	this train is still moving generally in the direction you needed to move so how do i fucking guide this thing the best i can with just mints
POD1000000042_S0000625	and the meantime because but there is a line no right like they start talking about green new deal or or nation wide mandating of certain things and that's crucial that's gonna be a fuck and problem for a lot of people man
POD1000000042_S0000627	look look let's let's don't take an aspirin before we got a headache right like let's start this off with the best mindset like we don't need this emotionally charged like we don't need like look let's let's don't be the same thing that we just bitched about the last four years
POD1000000042_S0000628	well it's hard i i get when i say but it's hard it's hard not to do that when elsie and her colleagues are tied not make a list of people can who support trump i was as a trump supporter
POD1000000042_S0000629	i i got it
POD1000000042_S0000630	and i'm and i'm not and i'm obviously not an a o c supporter either but if either one of those sides sought to make a list of the other side and i'm gonna have a fucking promised that an all of you should to but
POD1000000042_S0000631	we are hunt what we're talking about we're talking about we're taking about different issues right like
POD1000000042_S0000632	well we are when the leaders of the party like michelle obamas well like these people the seventy million people decided to vote for chaos and racism and how about to shut the fuck up shell how about that like she's one of the leader will regardless of having never run for politics and life
POD1000000042_S0000633	she's one of the leaders of the democratic party and what she says means a lot so she just called out seventy million people and told him that their fucking racist like how do you expect the other all they talk about right now so we need a unified surfy yeah of course
POD1000000042_S0000634	you wanna unify right now while you're winning in the game you don't want there to be any more violent
POD1000000042_S0000635	i'm with you listen i am with you i i i am with you but all we can hope is that over the next four years day that that we can at least lead by example
POD1000000042_S0000636	that we don't we don't turn around we don't grab guns and we don't go and we don't start you know holding guns to where people can't count outside of voting centers you know i mean like we like like this is i mean i'm saying the backside of both sides are fucked up
POD1000000042_S0000637	right
POD1000000042_S0000638	right so like i'm just saying as far as us we have a responsibility we have a platform we have responsibility to to look let's okay i got we said we were in a fight like we are in a fight
POD1000000042_S0000639	ah we said what we needed to get their best time to like cape like clean slate the sea we gonna do go on board like the sea we gonna do on board
POD1000000042_S0000640	i'm gonna reserve getting angry and so the actual policies are that are unpleasant being like that
POD1000000042_S0000641	the thing is unless that happens by executive order nothing's gonna happen
POD1000000042_S0000642	ah that'a all i think too
POD1000000042_S0000643	we've got a stalemate for through next four years
POD1000000042_S0000644	yeah cause it's it's the first time
POD1000000042_S0000645	it's gonna be it'll yeah for release
POD1000000042_S0000646	at least four years
POD1000000042_S0000648	republic no republicans are doubling and flipped the house in twenty twenty-two because that lets us be real honest about what's gonna happen even if anything biden was gonna push would have made some positive dent
POD1000000042_S0000649	he may he may ride the wave from post in a little inflate the way his numbers look the same way that trumps looked after ah obama's policies brought us out of recession let's be real about that
POD1000000042_S0000650	sustaining its important right yeah biden probably won't be able to because we know how these policies work but in twenty twenty-two he's gonna be he'll be writing that down the wave and republicans take the house
POD1000000042_S0000651	we'll see what happens i mean joe biden is a statesman he he is a weird guy sniffs people varied as r um but
POD1000000042_S0000653	he's existed in d c which is a fucking ah a hornet's nest for fifty years which is in itself impressive i think it's wrong that we have people to serve that long but it's impressive to be able to say keep your head above water for that amount time
POD1000000042_S0000654	so he's gonna adjust i think the problem is not him the problem is kamala harris
POD1000000042_S0000655	people i i i gotcha and look and all all i can look here's here's our best in my opinion ah best case scenario if biden wins is it biden lives another four years
POD1000000042_S0000656	and can state like we don't want him we don't want kamala harris gaunt being able will take our
POD1000000042_S0000657	i mean she won't what what what what even happened the senate doesn't the senate have to confirm a new v p s they probably won't even have a v p for the last two years for the economy
POD1000000042_S0000658	but what i hope is that i hope if anything if anything this next four years like abi said they probably won't pass much if i won't change my job we we i think we know that the man my hope for this country is is that if he does anything
POD1000000042_S0000659	that he can at least let america calm down like and so like we are so emotionally charged right now and look and i'm gonna i'm gonna put a lot that on donald trump like it he is emotionally exhausted us as a nation
POD1000000042_S0000660	that everything has to be a fight and and and and i got i got this all sides
POD1000000042_S0000661	i don't think it's all him to blame
POD1000000042_S0000662	i don't think it's all him to blame
POD1000000042_S0000663	the challenge the establishment so much they came out and said everything he does is racist or sexist or whatever
POD1000000042_S0000664	i got you but i think he but i think he could handle a little bit different
POD1000000042_S0000665	yeah but he never would have used up trump right as us know he doesn't have that in his tool box
POD1000000042_S0000666	so that's my hope is is that biden will at least at least you know take it down a notch of comic like you i mean i'm not charging of doing something dirty fighting behind could i imagine
POD1000000042_S0000667	well you can you can you can bet on right cause his statements are gonna be very limited and very short and anyways and somebody else we running the twitter fee
POD1000000042_S0000668	we imagine your household with your kids if you're fighting with your wife in front of the kids
POD1000000042_S0000669	hmm
POD1000000042_S0000670	like its tension everywhere right everybody's walk on egg shells gnat like hopefully they can act as adults
POD1000000042_S0000671	it does put a little pressure on you particularly as a man i think
POD1000000042_S0000672	yes
POD1000000042_S0000673	but even so as a woman and and congress
POD1000000042_S0000674	senate to respond aggressively if you're spoken to aggressively cause it appears weak
POD1000000042_S0000675	or may imagine a cop walking up and saying hey motherfucker what are you doing what you think you're doing like here you are not gonna consider me like oh well sir
POD1000000042_S0000676	yeah that'll be like a mind of my goddamn business
POD1000000042_S0000678	fuck you doing
POD1000000042_S0000680	ah last but not least i wanna i wanna to chat with you guys about the ah the cupboard miracle that happened today
POD1000000042_S0000682	um seven i mean just you know they couldn't they couldn't release that seven days ago on on the day after the monday after but biden and harris get elected a pfizer comes out
POD1000000042_S0000683	um which is what donald trump gave all the money too and says amen oh we haven't we've got the cure and that's we were ninety percent right now we're gonna about fifty million of those guys out out into the world in january
POD1000000042_S0000684	i to me cause dan rails on this all the time that big farmers always in bed with democrats this was a big fat fuck you from big pharma to donald trump saying ah
POD1000000042_S0000685	well he's the only one is taken on the court trying to get drug prices lowered he's only one trying to have ah these other bargaining schedules that you can buy drugs from and stuff like that he's definitely taken them on and they made him pay for ads
POD1000000042_S0000686	and he took on big tack and they made him pay for that too yeah
POD1000000042_S0000687	yeah
POD1000000042_S0000688	let's be real about this the reason donald trump didn't get reelected isn't because people don't like the way he talks right because
POD1000000042_S0000689	took her by the time
POD1000000042_S0000690	because when we come on the show and talk the way we talk we get more viewers right the more authentic we are the more viewers we get an he is there's no more authentic american donald trump let's be real for better or worse
POD1000000042_S0000691	yeah yeah i know
POD1000000042_S0000692	but he for for at least two years
POD1000000042_S0000693	they never held back
POD1000000042_S0000694	like a fucking a dude from from new york that's got a fucking attitude about him but he's also been successful off course he's gonna get an even bigger attitude blah blah blah and now is in the seventies and the billionaire how the fuck you think he's gonna act right it's it made perfect sense however
POD1000000042_S0000695	ah that all that stuff his personnel i don't i don't believe that i don't believe people voted against no trump because he's course when he speaks i think it's ah ah coordinated effort from all these very
POD1000000042_S0000696	look if if the pharmaceutical industry that's been trying to but fuck you for years and is very successful in doing so since eighty percent of all privately file bankruptcies are filed because on pay medical expenses
POD1000000042_S0000697	and tech companies who we know have done everything they can to go out of the way to exploit our data and sell that information off the people you think either one of those people are working for your best interest right now there's no fucking way right now
POD1000000042_S0000698	so that that's why it always brings me back to the same conclusion i am not a trump supporter however it would have been a lot better for the country had he been reelected
POD1000000042_S0000699	and for a lot of different reasons
POD1000000042_S0000700	and and i think it was one hour this let me just double down this
POD1000000042_S0000701	yeah

POD1000000043_S0000032	alright let's get to the news less than a year after the first documented coronavirus infection in the united states the food and drug administration just authorized pfizer's covid-nineteen vaccine for emergency use
POD1000000043_S0000033	and the initial injections have begun today marking the launch of the largest vaccination effort in american history
POD1000000043_S0000034	the doses will be distributed based on each state's adult population and the states themselves would decide who gets vaccinated first with frontline health care workers expected to be at the front of the line
POD1000000043_S0000035	the first ship of three million doses enough to inoculate one point five million people were flown out of grand rapids michigan on sunday after being transported from one of pfizer's nearby facilities
POD1000000043_S0000036	here's a clip at the crowd that gathered to watch the vaccine leave the warehouse
POD1000000043_S0000038	it's just nice to see a group of people cheering science and not trying to burn scientists at the stake
POD1000000043_S0000040	that clip wasn't anything special for listeners that could have been any crowd but like it's it's not often we've been able to talk about good news here ah especially in twenty-twenty on pod save america
POD1000000043_S0000041	so that we play that clip um love it you have any thoughts on the scope and speed of this scientific achievement and and how it came to be
POD1000000043_S0000043	yeah you know there's a i actually really really recommend there was a deep deep dive in the washington post
POD1000000043_S0000044	ah that was i think pretty fair in looking at the achievement operation warp speed trump's impact his negative impact and
POD1000000043_S0000046	ah inside of that peace and i don't wanna just make it about trump but i do think that there's something important in it because you know inside of that peace which is really about like
POD1000000043_S0000048	this is one of the greatest achievements in the history of science really is and it's born of an incredible focus over the last year it's born of decades of investment in the public sector and basic research in
POD1000000043_S0000049	in systems that try to prevent the influence of politics of you know corporate influence and interference on science that building a public health ah infrastructure of trust in institutions like all of that
POD1000000043_S0000050	but then there is this team ah ah administration official and the peace and they are quoted to saying something along the lines of in twenty years people won't remember bleach they won't remember him not wearing masks they won't remember this they'll just remember operation warp speed
POD1000000043_S0000052	ah ah administration official and the peace and they are quoted to saying something along the lines of in twenty years people won't remember bleach they won't remember him not wearing masks they won't remember this they'll just remember operation warp speed
POD1000000043_S0000053	and i saw that i was like oh oh okay i ah you know you wishing is not gonna make that happen and and what was striking to me and seeing the trucks
POD1000000043_S0000055	it was bittersweet to me i was watching the videos on repeat
POD1000000043_S0000056	because what else am i gonna do ah and ah what i was thinking when i saw it is
POD1000000043_S0000058	look at this incredible achievement that like the scientists and and the government were able to do together took everything that trump paid said took ah disciplined and took belief in institutions it took not allowing political interference took public
POD1000000043_S0000060	math science
POD1000000043_S0000061	and all of those things you human ingenuity human creativity human discipline it was enough to overcome the virus and that's extraordinary but it wasn't enough to overcome trump it wasn't enough over to overcome the failure of leadership
POD1000000043_S0000062	the failure to give people resources to survive the failure to have enough mass the failure to model best practices the failure to model good behavior the failure to celebrate the people that were doing the right thing the failure to help the people that were doing the right thing
POD1000000043_S0000063	because there was no reason that this vaccine would come at a time in which the virus was completely unchecked in his country and that is trump's great failure
POD1000000043_S0000064	and it is a tribute to every single person who was involved in making this vaccine happen that they were able to overcome the absence of leadership
POD1000000043_S0000065	that ah has been basically the only consistent thing trump has offered up and until him pretending to be a leader by badgering officials to make the vaccine rollout faster just before it is approved
POD1000000043_S0000066	so that he could claim some credit and get himself in the news cycle and ends it as it began
POD1000000043_S0000067	tell me what do you think do you think we'll still remember the bleach in twenty
POD1000000043_S0000069	the idea today that needs to be looking predictable what we will or won't remember in twenty i mean i feel like in twenty years our kids are gonna be like sway you guys could have put clean x on your face and not had three hundred thousand people died and you choose not to what's what's wrong with you like you know it's anyway
POD1000000043_S0000070	that idiot is an idiot ah any personal level i just feel like it has been like really nice for all of our mental health to wake up in and read the stories and see these photos right hannah and i cancelled our plans to see her family on thanksgiving
POD1000000043_S0000071	we're staying in l a over christmas instead of going to see my mom and my sister and my brother in boston and it sucks right any holidays or big deal to us there to everybody but you know finally there's there's light at the end of the tunnel here
POD1000000043_S0000072	and now to love its point i mean this vaccine is a miracle ninety-five percent effective and created in record time i mean we are so so lucky that it is so much faster than anything in history
POD1000000043_S0000073	it is way more effective than your standard flu vaccine ah so this is a miracle and and we should be quick the pfizer vaccine was developed by a german couple
POD1000000043_S0000074	right one of them was born in turkey and emigrated to germany when he was four the other is the daughter of turkish immigrants to germany so for all the trump's credit crap ah we have germans and immigrants to thank for this pfizer vaccine
POD1000000043_S0000075	the the operation warp speed folks deserve some credit for buying a hundred million doses of the pfizer vaccine they deserve our eternal hatred and shame for passing on up to four hundred million doses at no cost to the u s i mean we could just like pay them when we got it right
POD1000000043_S0000076	but you know it's an extraordinary scientific feat ah there's some really interesting research about how in the future we might be able to speed up this process even more and we might be able to pre prepare vaccines for almost all the major known viruses out there
POD1000000043_S0000077	we could maybe create a vaccine for fifty to a hundred at the most you know serve dangerous prominent viruses for the cost of the f thirty-five fighter jet program so that seems like a a pretty good deal compared to a a plane we may or may not need to use
POD1000000043_S0000078	so lots of good news today ah you know feeling really good about this um and you know it was nice to see people feeling less scared basically
POD1000000043_S0000079	so i just remember in april when this started doctor foci said twelve to eighteen months for a vaccine hopefully
POD1000000043_S0000080	and there are a bunch of epidemiologists scientists and others saying that fochi's time line was way too optimistic for twelve to eighteen months eleven months that's what this vaccine hem in eleven months
POD1000000043_S0000081	ah the shortest time line previously for any vaccine ever was the mumps vaccine which took four years that was the record and were gone from four years to eleven months and like you know tommy you just mentioned about the ninety-five percent effective
POD1000000043_S0000082	f d a was ready to approve a vaccine that was over fifty percent effective know like the the number of people had expected ninety-five percent effective i mean this is it a truly is a miracle
POD1000000043_S0000083	ah there were there were headlines back in the spring time like we may never get a vaccine um so no i i i had the same kind of you know hope and optimism
POD1000000043_S0000084	this section is jon basically being so mad at like a series of of articles in the atlantic they were so annoying over the course of many moves like the doom and gloom publication of choice for several months
POD1000000043_S0000085	i i i i've been i've been holding back on this
POD1000000043_S0000087	the atlantic has some like the best journalists in the world and write some of the best fucking stuff in the world but the number of dooms that you can just google and the number of doomsday headlines that fucking publication about how we're gonna live forever with this and never go be the same is ridiculous
POD1000000043_S0000088	um but anyway
POD1000000043_S0000090	no so i was i was like i was very hopeful and optimistic too and kinda what you were saying like
POD1000000043_S0000092	like it
POD1000000043_S0000093	it really speaks to the fact that you know our world is politics we talk so much about politics we're all obsessive with politics and politics is really broken and the brokenness of politics has contributed to the death and disaster that has come from this pandemic
POD1000000043_S0000094	but other parts of society are not broken science is not broken like this this was a feat of science and just like a modern miracle that um that we should celebrate
POD1000000043_S0000095	even though you know politics failed us
POD1000000043_S0000097	every other way every other way
POD1000000043_S0000098	well i also i also just say to that like fauci said basically that he was gonna see this vaccine to the end
POD1000000043_S0000099	and that the compromises he was making you know being inside of his administration in a week we talked a lot about people saying they were compromising you know not telling the truth about trump for their own political gains
POD1000000043_S0000100	failing to make any headway failing to actually stand up to trump of doing the morally reprehensible an easy thing but like here is this guy fauci who i think like we will look back and say like did an extraordinary thing of serving his country
POD1000000043_S0000101	despite the the headwinds that were presented by his boss despite the incredible obstacles set up by donald trump to make sure that this came to an end and like he's a real you know he's a hero
POD1000000043_S0000103	yes so ah trump did ah publicly pressure the f d a to speed up the approval process from saturday to friday ah and his chief of staff reportedly threatened to fire f d a commissioner steven hot if that didn't happen that you can see any problems with that
POD1000000043_S0000104	i mean yeah look look for we just talk about this issue of credit for a minute because there's other debate going on too but like
POD1000000043_S0000105	when we talk about the pfizer vaccine the u s deserves credit for making advance purchase of that vaccine in july they got a hundred million doses
POD1000000043_S0000106	where i i already mentioned how angry i am that they didn't advance purchase several hundred million more doses but whatever
POD1000000043_S0000107	but the thing is incredible again about the moderna vaccine is it that vaccine was designed january thirteenth twenty-twenty we've had this vaccine formula in our hands for the entire year
POD1000000043_S0000108	he's a very brave chinese doctor ah sequence the genome and publicized it and though these advances in m r n a technology that none of us actually understand but it allowed us to pull this off so quickly and now the problem becomes logistics
POD1000000043_S0000109	but i mean in terms of like threatening the f d a chief i mean there's a huge problem with that i mean even the term operation warp speed is horribly problematic if you think about it from a medical point of view
POD1000000043_S0000110	we know trump wants credit for the vaccine being developed quickly but this isn't fast food like no one is really pumped about like a a rushed medical product right like no one's getting the the fastest created tylenol ever right
POD1000000043_S0000112	it's a bad idea to talk about this and into talk about it as something had happened quickly or in a rushed manner and so going even further to politicize the approval process is a bad idea
POD1000000043_S0000113	when you've got like you know obviously there's some subsets of the anti-vaxxer community that are kind of super aggressive and dangerous and spreading misinformation
POD1000000043_S0000114	then there's other people especially in the black community who have read about the tuskegee syphilis study and have some understandable hesitation based on that history about a new drug
POD1000000043_S0000115	so this is gonna require a serious science based public awareness campaign ah and that's really important cuz there's a lot of people in this country who desperately want a vaccine but can't have it
POD1000000043_S0000116	right like if you're getting chemotherapy you can't get the vaccine if you're under sixteen as of right now you can't take the vaccine it's not clear when it's gonna be approved for pregnant women
POD1000000043_S0000117	and so if the virus is swirling around the country there is a bunch of vaccine eligible people just refused to take it that'll put others at risk
POD1000000043_S0000118	and so that's why you know that just it's horrible that we have to read these stories over and over again of of trump's politicizing the process when if he had to shut up and stepped back and let the process work things would be better
POD1000000043_S0000119	in fact pfizer didn't take operation warp speed money because they were worried that the government might slow them down
POD1000000043_S0000121	yeah i mean like trump is the worst offender here but it is going to be a major challenge to get the public communication around this correct you know even for the biden administration is gonna reproach in good faith you know
POD1000000043_S0000122	even you know the f d a approval process you know it wasn't it wasn't in a unanimous decision and some people are like why do some members of the panel vote against it well it turns out the people who vote against it were just saying oh i don't think it's ready for sixteen-and-seventeen-year-old
POD1000000043_S0000124	two specific ages but it's like that's the kind of thing that you actually need to make sure you communicate clearly to people cuz if you just see a number oh some people vote against you think it's dangerous it's not it's just they had a problem with the ages so far you know
POD1000000043_S0000125	so there is gonna be like there is no such thing as too much ah public communication around this vaccination effort and it really has to be consistent and done very well
POD1000000043_S0000126	well i mean look i there's something such a to me was such like a signal example of what trump has done throughout this period because yeah he was complaining that oh they held back the saying that the vaccine work
POD1000000043_S0000127	because they didn't want to help me in my election right that was just in the ah in the past couple weeks but this was like
POD1000000043_S0000129	did he knew the approval was gonna happen it had nothing to do with him he wasn't gonna speed it up he wasn't really gonna slow it down the vaccine was gonna be delivered on monday
POD1000000043_S0000130	so he like hectored and hectored and hectored to achieve some made-up results so that he could look like a t v president
POD1000000043_S0000132	ah the other piece of this too is there's a lot of stuff that should have been happened that hasn't happened right like
POD1000000043_S0000133	there should be a public campaign going on right now that doesn't exist about how the vaccine's gonna be distributed where it's gonna go like there's all the aspects of presidential leadership that has just been completely missing right
POD1000000043_S0000134	like it's why there aren't enough ninety-five mask right now why there's there there may be supply problems down the line with a vaccine and it's wide right now we don't know how people will get it
POD1000000043_S0000135	we don't know where it's gonna go we don't know the process because there's been no public education and some of this hasn't even been fully thought of

POD1000000043_S0000198	trump administration officials have said they hope to vaccinate up to twenty-four million americans by mid january ah and joe biden has set a goal of a hundred million vaccinations within his first hundred days which brings us to the end of april
POD1000000043_S0000199	what are some of the bigger challenges in getting every american inoculated as quickly as possible you know we've already covered sort of the demand side of it which is making sure that enough people want it and trust it but what are some of the other other issues involved in this tommy
POD1000000043_S0000200	i i mean i think it's this is now just a massive logistical issue you know when you think about a hundred million two hundred million five hundred million doses if everybody needs two of them all of those doses need to be contained in a little vial
POD1000000043_S0000201	and they all need to be manufactured and they all need to be shipped somewhere and they all need to be doled out by states that are really short on cash and so it really is like thank god joe biden and his team is coming in and it really is just about competency
POD1000000043_S0000202	and so that's where you know again i feel a little hope more hopeful i mean i feel hopeful in a lot of ways with joe biden than trump but it's something we should all feel hopeful about and maybe we should speed up these timelines
POD1000000043_S0000203	i guess something i don't understand and i'm look i'm totally out of my depth here is why the u s government isn't using the defense production act to maybe aid in manufacturing or distribution of of the of the vaccine
POD1000000043_S0000204	i'm not saying that they should do it trump seems to be attempting to do with his executive order which is you know use the d p a or use the government to say hey pfizer all your doses are for us they're not for other countries like that's immoral
POD1000000043_S0000205	and it's not feasible because they manufacture a lot of these doses outside the country too but like at a minimum we could use a d p a to ramp up production of p p e
POD1000000043_S0000206	or we could use military assets to to ship some of these vaccines especially the ones that need to be stored at super cold temperatures we could ramp up the availability and frequency of testing
POD1000000043_S0000207	ah to do a better job of identifying outbreaks and i do think like the thing we are just talking about was the broken messaging and and clarity about what's gonna happen and what's gonna expect um and and the biden team will fix that
POD1000000043_S0000208	along those lines i mean i think one of the best things that you know the media could do is commit to not reporting on or amplifying trump's covid related lies or misinformation
POD1000000043_S0000209	starting the day he leaves office you know what i mean he is like the biggest problem in terms of vaccine hesitation right now and we should all agree that we are moving on from this asshole if you're not you know a fox news host
POD1000000043_S0000210	i sort of get the sense that the d p a is like and it's tough to figure this out now because we saw the trump administration here and we don't know what the biden administration's gonna do but it's almost like a last resort thing that you use
POD1000000043_S0000211	if all of the different private companies aren't cooperating and doing what you want them to do fast enough and of course it's like there's a whole supply chain issue right so they supply the vaccine
POD1000000043_S0000212	but there's glass vials syringes needles cooling systems ultra cold freezers g p s thermal sensors i mean if you read some of the stories about what they have to do to vaccine around it's incredible and it's like so much more than just needing enough actual vaccine
POD1000000043_S0000213	so the coordination and and logistics are just like mind boggling also delivering them right like you need how the the the first batch of vaccines are going to hospitals that can handle ultra-cold storage which is not every hospital
POD1000000043_S0000214	trucks that can handle-ultra cold storage which is certainly not every truck
POD1000000043_S0000215	and then you have the issue where it's like gonna be harder to reach rural and underserved areas that just don't have the right healthcare capacity how do you get it to them when you don't have the right trucks and hospitals there like it is a it's a biden administration has quite a challenge
POD1000000043_S0000216	we need the moderna approval to come through cuz that could be stored at more regular temperatures and that will i think help
POD1000000043_S0000217	for sure
POD1000000043_S0000218	and i i do sort of wish astra zeneca hadn't just told doctors to kind of you know give give people two or three fingers worth you know what i mean
POD1000000043_S0000220	two fingers for most people three fingers if you are like if you you know really thirsty for the vaccine
POD1000000043_S0000222	because not great not great i wonder what's going on with johnson and johnson come on johnson and johnson but
POD1000000043_S0000223	tell me you ah tell me you said this a couple times so we really should hit on it like this fucking the fact that the trump administration could have bought four hundred million more doses from pfizer
POD1000000043_S0000224	habit knows of the new york times story a couple of weeks ago have the chance in july and that i didn't realize until i saw scott gottlieb the former f d a commissioner was on ah c n b c this morning saying
POD1000000043_S0000225	is or as late as november this november the trump administration had another chance to buy another four-hundred million doses and didn't and we still don't know why like they keep looking for like
POD1000000043_S0000226	or we just is this hyperbole are we like not no no ah there's no explanation anywhere as far as i can tell of why they passed up in november the chance to buy another four-hundred million doses
POD1000000043_S0000227	i get that they're hedging their bets and buying from a bunch of companies but again like
POD1000000043_S0000228	right
POD1000000043_S0000229	ah in the grand scheme of things first of all i think we had to make the payment upon receipt of the doses of we didn't get them from pfizer would have to pay the money but in the grand scheme a thing spending another eight billion dollars on vaccine doses is nothing
POD1000000043_S0000230	nothing compared to the cost in lives in our economy and and everything else it is it is baffling and it is absolutely mind boggling it is baffling i don't get how this happened the this is a a fuck up of just epic proportion
POD1000000043_S0000231	and i don't mean hopefully will figure out who did it i bet the e-mail just like unopened in jared's and box of one of his you know his college roommates ah you know told him not to do or something
POD1000000043_S0000232	yeah i i've been looking to it there's really is you can't find any plausible explanation because it was not the money was no risk there is no risk adjustment was like ink if it worked
POD1000000043_S0000234	if it worked
POD1000000043_S0000235	and it's like i was like are they were they were they worried about getting the super cold version where they were also counting on moderna astrazeneca johnson and johnson or any explanations over there's been no explanation once
POD1000000043_S0000236	it's none
POD1000000043_S0000237	it's crazy you touch on this but you know experts say that it's gonna cost about eight billion dollars for the states to distribute all this and it's not just it's distribution it's storing the vaccine hiring medical workers running public awareness campaigns federal government picks up some of the tab but a lot of this is on the states
POD1000000043_S0000238	and of course states don't have any money left because of this recession and there had been begging for local and state aid for months that mitch mcconnell is holding up single handedly ah is on fact is holding up the entire covid relief bill over this
POD1000000043_S0000239	because he doesn't want states to get a penny of additional money ah it's it does seem to me like democrats just hammer this issue relentlessly and like turn the state local aid issue into an issue about vaccine distribution to states
POD1000000043_S0000240	yeah i mean just before we were recording it look like some of the negotiators were putting out can have two versions right they were gonna put out the version of the bill that was just the relief portion and they were gonna separate out
POD1000000043_S0000241	the state aid and the liability portion
POD1000000043_S0000242	cuz they probably know that that's not gonna pass and they're like i will just fucking set that loose
POD1000000043_S0000243	well it it does seem like if we if we really are separating out liability and state and local aid it does seem to doom liability protections in state and local aid because mitch mcconnell won't budge on state on state local aid or democrats obviously don't want liability protections
POD1000000043_S0000244	i don't care what what that negotiation looks like ah it's it's a maddening thing you know i talked to schotz about it in love it or leave it and it really is
POD1000000043_S0000245	it's it's worth remembering this is taking a really important part of protecting people and helping people during this crisis and adding a completely unrelated thing of proof of immunizing corporations
POD1000000043_S0000246	ah which does nothing to help us get out of this crisis ah but it does seem as though separating those things out makes both impotent far less likely to happen while making you know direct payments may be more plausible i i don't know
POD1000000043_S0000247	i just the one of the things that drives me the most insane about washington is that it's all about expectations management when in terms of press coverage rights so like the worst you are as a human being
POD1000000043_S0000248	the the more terrible you are consistently the less likely you are to like get hammered over an issue like this and and when it comes to mitch mcconnell he has spent months refusing to engage with democrats over covid relief period right like and now he wants to punish states
POD1000000043_S0000249	because their finances have been decimated by lockdowns that were made necessary by a federal response that was absolutely miserable and again like love image is his top priority is liability protection for businesses
POD1000000043_S0000250	what like mitch mcconnell has blood on his hands people are waiting for hours in food lines because of mitch mcconnell right like states have to decide who gets this vaccine first they have to distribute it they have to do all these logistics and need preventing them from getting that money
POD1000000043_S0000251	right now mitch mcconnell is blocking a bipartisan bill to prevent patients ah who have insurance from getting surprise medical bills for unexpected out of network or emergency care why
POD1000000043_S0000252	is he cares more about private equity backed insurance company profits than regular people mcconnell is one of the worst people in political life and political history he is disgusting he's a corporate stooge he's cynical
POD1000000043_S0000253	and like the coverage of him in how he acts is is talked about as sort of savvy or tough and impressive the reality is he's a monster he's a monster he's a bad legislator all he does is block shit everything they do is via some
POD1000000043_S0000255	you get punished for trying you know what i mean it's like everyone's hammering pelosi online for engaging or not engaging fucking tweeting pictures of the amount of ice cream she has in her freezer like mitch mcconnell is the clear enemy he has been all along
POD1000000043_S0000257	but this is this surprises me not just like you and you know why mitch mcconnell's gonna get his way on this and that this deal is probably gonna pass with all of the shit that he wants or doesn't want it is because he's got the fucking numbers and he's got donald trump in the white house like i thought you know
POD1000000043_S0000258	bernie sanders said with that the deal is bad we shouldn't support the deal and like i i agree with them in the sense that the deal is fucking bad the bipartisan compromise is bad
POD1000000043_S0000259	now that they've separated state local aid and liability protections was left over is even more inadequate than the bipartisan compromise it's it's shit for sure but like
POD1000000043_S0000260	what's the what's the choice here like you're gonna you're not gonna negotiate a better package with these republicans who you're gonna get to vote for more money you're gonna get susan collins and mitt romney to vote for more money and lisa murkowski no they said this is the best that they would do
POD1000000043_S0000261	and if you don't take the deal and we don't win georgia we're not gonna get a better deal when joe biden's president and joe biden's not gonna have a mechanism to force a better deal because mitch mcconnell's gonna sit there and say fuck you i have the numbers i don't have to pass a deal
POD1000000043_S0000262	if they really do pull out state and local aid and they pull out the liability protections which obviously none of us think should be part of this at all makes no sense ah and they have said from the beginning they won't do a trillion dollar keep in mind democrats are to come down from
POD1000000043_S0000264	to two trillion to one-five now we're trying to get to one i i what i don't know is what happens if they replace the state and local aid as it was drafted with direct payments does that become something that gets people like bernie back on board
POD1000000043_S0000265	i don't know maybe maybe you try that i mean bernie is one thing but like like josh holly or some of these republicans who want direct payments yeah i would i would try to get as much in there as i could you know and i will try to push more direct payments for sure but like at the end of the day
POD1000000043_S0000266	i would also take whatever is left because something is better than nothing for people who are struggling even though it's not much
POD1000000043_S0000267	i mean look congress doesn't do anything well anymore what they do is they jam every bill they're ever supposed to pass together in what's called an omnibus and the deadline for that bill which is currently i think one point four trillion with a t dollars is friday
POD1000000043_S0000268	or else the government shuts down they're gonna try to jam whatever like covid relief measures they can into that and that's kinda like the best and only shot we're gonna have until february march i don't know
POD1000000043_S0000270	i also what i was going to say is yeah that that's exactly right until like this
POD1000000043_S0000272	if there is gonna be something close to a trillion dollar relief bill it will be inadequate it will be terribly inadequate and people will be suffering next year
POD1000000043_S0000273	and if what you're doing is replacing state and local aid with direct payments to people you are ah ah you are kind of changing where that inadequacy where that pain will be felt
POD1000000043_S0000274	and basically what you're saying is next year you want states and localities to be put in an incredibly difficult positions right as hopefully we're emerging from this to cut transportation cut schools cut public health
POD1000000043_S0000275	cut the police something republicans ah seem to believe ah is something that they oppose ah ah and every other local service so it really is like
POD1000000043_S0000276	because we are talking talking about a completely inadequate stimulus no matter what happens we are really just talking about who who do we want to unnecessarily subject to pain
POD1000000043_S0000278	you want an adequate stimulus vote for two democrats in georgia that's how we're gonna get adequate stimulus
POD1000000043_S0000280	yeah that's it other big news today is that it's the day assigned by the u s constitution for each state's electors to gather and cast their official ballots for president based on the winner of the popular vote in that state
POD1000000043_S0000281	as the founders intended
POD1000000043_S0000282	as it literally
POD1000000043_S0000283	you gather and hide
POD1000000043_S0000285	with police protection yeah exactly sorry sorry sorry i am on um i'm woo i'm too hot today
POD1000000043_S0000286	it is a day that it's the day that usually passes off without much fanfare except for this year when donald trump and most republican politicians in congress have so far refused to accept the results of a presidential election for the first time in american history
POD1000000043_S0000287	even though their false conspiracies about voter fraud have essentially been unanimously rejected by election officials and judges from across the political spectrum liberal and conservative democrat and republican
POD1000000043_S0000288	the latest and likely last legal challenge to invalidate every ballot cast in four battleground states was rejected by the u s supreme court only two justices clarence thomas and samuel alito believe the court was obligated to hear such a case
POD1000000043_S0000289	but even they refused to hear this particular pile of steaming garbage they were like yeah basically these kind of cases i don't know if we can show them to open but this case yeah no no definitely this case
POD1000000043_S0000290	um so on one hand we have a complete rejection by the supreme court the comes after fifty-nine other rejections by judges appointed by democratic and republican presidents including trump
POD1000000043_S0000291	on the other we have seventeen state attorneys general and a hundred and twenty-six republican members of the house of representatives that is more than half the republican caucus
POD1000000043_S0000292	including minority leader kevin mccarthy who wants to be fucking speaker the house in two years um all these people publicly supported an attempt to overturn the results of the election publicly supported and lent their names to
POD1000000043_S0000293	ah what do you guys take away from that tommy
POD1000000043_S0000294	i i mean i take away that the republican party is no longer a party it's a cult and and the cult leader is about to be out of office but he is still mixing up a a big vat of kool-aid ah and he has not loosened his grip on these people at all
POD1000000043_S0000295	right it doesn't matter how irrational the demand is it doesn't matter that the demands are illegal the maga cult does not believe in democracy they believe in trump
POD1000000043_S0000296	and you know i just people love to both sides and decry partisanship like we should just be clear this very new thing like the democratic party was supportive of obama
POD1000000043_S0000297	but if he had said ah falsely that the b p oil spill was fixed whenever one was watching oil gushing out of it on live t v zero democrats would have fallen in line behind him right
POD1000000043_S0000298	but like trump's covid denial is worse than that this this electoral fiction he's peddling is worse than that and so at it's a very scary thing
POD1000000043_S0000299	ah i would like to believe that will be destructive for the republican party and then maybe democrats can win but the odds are that twenty twenty-two is gonna be brutal be as redistricting and so we shouldn't count on it
POD1000000043_S0000300	i don't i don't know the way around it like i i hope that people will get tired of his shtick but that was my hope in twenty fifteen and then sixteen and then you know the republican primary happened and obviously that didn't happen
POD1000000043_S0000301	i hate to say guys oh well one obvious thing that would be helpful is winning these georgia run offs but then you know i hate to say it but it would it would also help i think if brian kemp ah survived his primary challenge
POD1000000043_S0000302	that's gonna come i mean that we need some anti-trump republicans to start winning so that they're all not living in fear of a primary challenge from a trump backed candidate otherwise the guys just gonna hold a grip on the party
POD1000000043_S0000303	a grip on fox news a grip on newsmax and it's we're stuck in the cycle and i think we have to beat them all i mean at all i just i like there's no i look i know how hard the house is gonna be in twenty twenty-two i don't know if everyone realizes this but um it's gonna it was gonna be hard no matter what now with redistricting it's gonna be even harder
POD1000000043_S0000304	but like i don't see an option besides winning the house or holding the house in twenty twenty-two
POD1000000043_S0000305	because if like you know i've been saying that a lot of the concern over donald trump's successfully overturning this election um is is a little overhyped
POD1000000043_S0000306	because we have democrats in all the right positions because we control the house of representatives because we controlled the governorships in wisconsin michigan and pennsylvania like that's the only reason that i felt safe
POD1000000043_S0000307	and and and saying that joe biden is gonna be president if we have a republican house in twenty twenty-four not only do i think they'll have impeached joe biden by then they'll just make up some reasons to do that
POD1000000043_S0000308	but then in the twenty twenty-four election if the if the republican candidate or if trump pulls what trump pulled again it goes to congress and now you have a republican house
POD1000000043_S0000309	and do we really think the republican house is going to ah play by the rules after what happened this time i don't think so
POD1000000043_S0000310	yeah i think we should not confuse the fact that this coup will fail and that it's instigators are silly and buffoonish from how dangerous this moment is i don't think i think that that sort of trivial i think we all get that
POD1000000043_S0000311	but then i do think and then they're just promising okay with what we do what we know what we need to do we need to win elections alright and the problem is we just ran ah a a a national election
POD1000000043_S0000312	in which we won we won up by four point five percent of the vote by giving the way where our voters are ah giving some of the hair inherent anti-democratic aspects of the senate
POD1000000043_S0000313	it was not enough to to win the to win the senate and we still managed to lose some house seats and those fundamental problems are not going anywhere we're not abolishing the electoral college
POD1000000043_S0000314	ah in the next four years we're not getting rid of the senate we're we're we're gonna have some really bad redistricting ah that's gonna hurt us ah because we did so poorly ah in legislatures
POD1000000043_S0000315	and so to me like i do think we have to split these things into a kind of two big difficult conversations one is how do we win inside of democracy and the other is how do we preserve democracy and fight for it against a party that has abandoned
POD1000000043_S0000316	i no longer am interested in stories about how republicans behind the scenes say they don't really mean it no you do mean it this is it i thought you know you're not in private saying that you don't support what you support
POD1000000043_S0000317	actually in private you're pretending to hold a set of beliefs that nothing in your politics nothing in your public statements ah ah is true you're pretending to not believe it while everything you do ah ah separates democracy you know
POD1000000043_S0000318	ted cruz is not putting on a show ted cruz is doing what he thinks is in his best interest he's not doing it he's not going above and beyond he's not saying he wants to argue before the supreme court because he's afraid of trump he's he's chosen aside he's seen where his people as go are going so that he can lead them
POD1000000043_S0000319	what they learned from trump is that shame is not a useful attribute to have in politics so they are all shame you cannot shame these people all we do is a oh all these republicans gonna learn better we're just gonna put pressure on them
POD1000000043_S0000320	we're not putting any pressure on them they don't pressure is not gonna change their behavior shame is not gonna change their behavior anymore they have to be beaten that's what gonna like i i know it we you know we we did win this time and he tried to steal it but it was enough
POD1000000043_S0000321	it was a big enough margin that he was not able to steal it and which the only thing we can do in the future is to beat these people and like you said like we were not gonna eliminate the electoral college before then before we beat them we're not gonna fix gerrymandering before we beat them
POD1000000043_S0000322	we're not gonna fix the senate before we beat them all roads lead back to beating them in elections there's nothing else
POD1000000043_S0000323	yeah and i would say to like the next ah the con the conversation we should have is obviously not about shame but i i do think we should be talking i did is a much longer term challenge than even what will have to do electorally to keep the house and to keep the white house
POD1000000043_S0000324	and it is like all right they're shameless they're mercenaries they're doing what they think is in their interest ah we need to talk about the fact that they don't view defending democracy is in their interest right that that propaganda has so thoroughly taken hold right
POD1000000043_S0000325	like when you say like they don't respond to shame like what does that mean it means that like virtue integrity these qualities no longer matter in our politics being honest ah caring about the basic civic ideas that are the bedrock of our country they are not important anymore
POD1000000043_S0000326	which tells us something which is like like it or not yah our institutions may have been just strong enough to get us through this
POD1000000043_S0000327	right but like this fascistic way of thinking like it's taken hold of a lot of people it's taken hold of a lot of people in this country and it's really really dangerous and we have to talk about those incentives and those levers because this will get worse unless we start looking up river
POD1000000043_S0000328	when we start looking at propaganda what facebook is doing what fox news is doing and actually having conversations about how we we combat it how we don't just lamented but we actually combat it

POD1000000043_S0000387	so there is there is one more play they're gonna try here ah lost all their legal challenges couldn't pressure any republican election officials to illegally refuse certification the results couldn't find any republican state legislatures to illegally send their own slate of electors
POD1000000043_S0000388	so now the look in a january sixth which is when the electoral votes are officially tallied in congress and read aloud by none other than the vice president mike pence so that's fun
POD1000000043_S0000389	the here's the rules if a member of the house and the senator together both raise an objection to a slate of electors both houses of congress have to vote on whether to reject or accept the objection
POD1000000043_S0000390	of course already a few house republicans no surprise there they're all fucking yahoos and a few senators like ron johnson of wisconsin have said they may object
POD1000000043_S0000391	like this is it's not gonna work because democrats have a majority in the house and will vote down the objection and there are now enough senators in the senate who have said joe biden as president of republican senators
POD1000000043_S0000392	that there's also a pro democracy majority in the senate so it's not gonna work but it is interesting to me that it's now going to put every single republican member of the house in the senate on record
POD1000000043_S0000393	as whether you are for or against the coup attendance so the ones who are trying to hide like marco rubio by bestowing the hand waving thing they'd be like forget about the coup thing it's the left wing outrage that's a problem
POD1000000043_S0000394	for a a left wing outrage about the coup that's the real problem
POD1000000043_S0000396	i'm not taking this beyond twitter i've said what i have to say on twitter i'm not gonna bring it to our podcasts still did not look did not couple democrats object bush vigour and they couldn't find a democratic senator to do any kind of went by the way
POD1000000043_S0000397	yeah in two-thousand four they did with kerry in ohio too but like this is madness
POD1000000043_S0000398	it'll go nowhere it'll go nowhere and this time they'll have a senator but they'll still go nowhere
POD1000000043_S0000399	this is drink the kool-aid this is their moment all of them will be on record oh should we call it the the coup
POD1000000043_S0000400	led with a with a p that worked
POD1000000043_S0000402	thanks guys i don't know if it's a good or a bad thing to have all these guys on the record
POD1000000043_S0000403	as four against the coup attempt i'd like to think it's a good thing maybe we can hold that against them in elections i don't know any more i don't know any more it's like that
POD1000000043_S0000404	i think we're gonna be sad i think it's gonna be a sad moment
POD1000000043_S0000405	every trump thing starts as like zany but then like he just goes all in on every maddening insane right wing like conspiracy theory that he did he latches onto and here we are i don't know
POD1000000043_S0000406	it's like when you say something ironically and then all is something just something you say you know what i mean
POD1000000043_S0000407	all of a sudden you are typing l o l
POD1000000043_S0000409	i think it's gonna be a really sad moment because like one of the institutions that have stood up really well during the coup attempt is the judiciary and we've seen you know liberal judges conservative judges trump judges all throw out these challenge
POD1000000043_S0000410	but at the end of the day selecting a president comes down to congress and you're right like we're gonna get a bunch of republican house members who object who cares about them they may they may get ron johnson or ted cruz or rand paul
POD1000000043_S0000411	or one of the buck nuts in the senate to join them and then both houses are going to have to vote which means that in the future if they do this it's not gonna matter what the courts do
POD1000000043_S0000412	if the courts throw them out because it'll ultimately come down to the january six moment in congress and what if you have a majority in congress one of these days it says yeah we're gonna throw out some we're gonna throw out some electors and and and and overturn the results that's all it takes that's all it takes it's just congress doing that
POD1000000043_S0000413	bit by bit
POD1000000043_S0000415	ah let's talk about so the damage that the coup attempt is already doing beyond our republican politicians the texas republican party responded to the supreme court decision by calling for secession
POD1000000043_S0000416	ah that's that's true that actually happened alex jones said that joe biden quote will be removed one way or another
POD1000000043_S0000417	sydney powell a former member of trump's legal team joined other maga lunatics in calling on the president to suspend the electoral college and set up military tribunals
POD1000000043_S0000418	ah many of these lunatics descended on washington over the weekend where right wing paramilitary groups like the proud boys attacked police counter protesters and defaced two historic black churches four people were stabbed and twenty-three arrested like where do we go from here
POD1000000043_S0000419	and these these these are fascist these people are fascists and these are their brown shirts and their storming around through washington and it is incredibly scary and unsettling ah and where we go from here feels uncertain to me
POD1000000043_S0000420	i hope we can get through inauguration and like joe biden will be in office and maybe these people can recede at the back but i do think think it's gonna it's gonna take a conscious choice for all of us the media politicians to stop covering donald trump
POD1000000043_S0000421	like he's the national narrator of all u s events we cannot center this man in our politics for four more years
POD1000000043_S0000422	and and and rid ourselves of like the cancer of of this maga fascist mindset you know like we have to try to move on from him somehow we have to get serious and actually focus on things that matter
POD1000000043_S0000423	or otherwise we're gonna be back here in four years and he's gonna be the g o p nominee and god knows what will happen
POD1000000043_S0000425	it was such a split screen moment for me over the weekend in just preparing for today's pod is on one hand you have the vaccine development and distribution and it's this it's this example of the entire world working together scientists health care workers
POD1000000043_S0000426	truckers politicians get real like everyone coming together to do something good and try to get people vaccinated and then you have the fucking assholes descending on washington just trying to burn everything down just trying to burn it all down
POD1000000043_S0000427	like these people are awful just awful
POD1000000043_S0000428	yeah and and i do think we need to stop trying to convince ourselves that because they're silly because they write things on their butts ah because sydney powell is a is a is a bad lawyer because rudy giuliani's face melted
POD1000000043_S0000429	like we need to stop taking comfort in the fact that they're silly because um ah like every dangerous violent revanchist anti-democratic movement is silly in some sense
POD1000000043_S0000430	if they weren't dumb if they weren't buffoonish they wouldn't support that movement and so like we should just keep in mind that some of the most dangerous and reactionary forces that have had a huge impact on this country
POD1000000043_S0000431	that have pulled this country backwards in our history were ah were were no weren't genius there were no they they they didn't have to be because when you employ violence when you introduce the specter of violence across our politics
POD1000000043_S0000432	it can work things and change things without you having to be very sophisticated and i just think that require i i i don't know what to do with that information i don't it's but it's just something we all should keep in mind
POD1000000043_S0000433	and like don't take comfort in their stupidity ju we just can't
POD1000000043_S0000435	yeah it is a it's still an open question of how big their numbers are and and and part of this is making sure the numbers don't get bigger you're not gonna do anything about the assholes who descended on dc but there's other people who could fall into that kind of trap you know
POD1000000043_S0000436	anyone will avoid that i'm mean like there's a new c b s poll out over the weekend you know that it gives the usual numbers only eighteen percent trump voters think biden the legitimately won the election forty-nine percent think trump should refuse to concede even if the electoral college votes for biden which they will
POD1000000043_S0000437	and seventy-five percent think republicans in congress should try to keep in trump in power but then i saw the endless question was forty percent of trump voters believe that if biden is the president
POD1000000043_S0000438	that um trump and his supporters should work together with biden on making progress which is surprised me because the same people who think they're the elections are not legitimate you know that sixty percent of them think never work with biden on anything so that's still a majority
POD1000000043_S0000439	but that forty percent might be where you began you know like because the only option we have at this point
POD1000000043_S0000440	what i also just think it's interesting too it's important too because what it does also show you is that these are in some sense performative reactions even to pollsters we're all pundits now we're all on a team
POD1000000043_S0000441	and like that's a good thing in the sense that people are saying things they don't totally mean it's a dangerous thing in which believes themselves are now at how you demonstrate your fealty which means nobody is gonna be telling the truth
POD1000000043_S0000442	and you know like i so i'm gonna i'm gonna do it ah vonnegut the quote which i think about all the time these days is you know you are what you pretend to be so be careful what you pretend to be yeah it doesn't matter
POD1000000043_S0000443	the difference what people say and what they think is it doesn't really matter because what people say and what they perform is what ah becomes our politics
POD1000000043_S0000444	i'm gonna i'm gonna follow suit here so i was reading obama's book and then i start reading ah like an old book i found from college from vaclav havel who is a playwright writer thinker political leader in the czech republic
POD1000000043_S0000445	and he talks about how every country every culture every like society has the sort of polls right there's always sort of a fascistic camp and there's always a more hopeful camp and it is up to the leaders to decide which one of those you awaken
POD1000000043_S0000446	and trump has spent four to six years awakening the scary fascistic ah right wing camp and the next republican like ronald reagan was awful he did immeasurable damage to this country
POD1000000043_S0000447	but he didn't do that and and we we barely survived that and the next set of republican leaders better be pretty goddamn careful
POD1000000043_S0000448	ah about whether or not they decide to reawaken those fascistic forces cuz right now those people were you know they were in d c over the weekend saying chanting destroy the g o p cause they won't go along with the coup attempt so yeah that shit will bite you back
POD1000000043_S0000449	they were all like you know you talk about future republican presidents but it's also this is this was part of joe biden's message in the campaign and talking about what you want to project to the country in what kind of a country that you want to have you know like
POD1000000043_S0000450	and do i ah have a lot of optimism that joe biden mitch mcconnell are gonna sit down and hammer out some deals together no i don't but i think biden's message was bigger than i am going to work with republicans in congress it's about you know a battle for the soul of the country in healing the nation
POD1000000043_S0000451	and i think projecting that image to the country it matters
POD1000000043_S0000453	and oh by the way lets add to the list ah as he projects that vision to the country he also perhaps without a senate hopefully with the senate that's incredibly divided regardless
POD1000000043_S0000454	he has to deliver and that's like the single most important thing he can do to save the country which is deliver
POD1000000043_S0000455	hundred percent

POD1000000044_S0000039	the session was recorded as a part of an educational psychotherapy video series in the session alvin is helping ted relive a memory the time his domineering father-in-law was rude to his wife
POD1000000044_S0000040	yeah and he is all dressed up
POD1000000044_S0000041	hi jennie yeah oh there he is hold on

POD1000000044_S0000043	hi how are you yes yes
POD1000000044_S0000044	alvin's eyes are shut tight his method is try to weld himself into the patient's skin to feel what the patient is feeling
POD1000000044_S0000045	i can do this better than you watch me

POD1000000044_S0000049	yeah that good
POD1000000044_S0000050	alvin does voices in role-plays and at times the session feels like avant grand improv
POD1000000044_S0000051	that son of a
POD1000000044_S0000052	it's playful and honestly kind of bizarre but the point of it all is to help the patient rehearse behavior in the office that he can then apply in real life
POD1000000044_S0000053	touch her touch her
POD1000000044_S0000054	oh
POD1000000044_S0000056	yeah hold her
POD1000000044_S0000058	so much
POD1000000044_S0000059	by the end of the session alvin has turned ted a meek buttoned-up patient into someone capable of expressing himself emotionally
POD1000000044_S0000060	gonna be this way with jennie cuz you've rehearsed
POD1000000044_S0000061	we got it huh
POD1000000044_S0000062	i'm ready
POD1000000044_S0000064	we have this ability within us to become a whole new person
POD1000000044_S0000066	alvin died in twenty-fourteen but this is howard a psychotherapist and one of alvin's disciples howard runs alvin's website and publishes his books
POD1000000044_S0000067	are are you talking a little hyperbolically when you say a whole new person
POD1000000044_S0000068	no it he is that's radical job then it's to become a whole new person the term is used as an optimal person and discover that within yourself
POD1000000044_S0000070	according to alvin once you've discovered this optimal personhood you can shake off what others want and live on your own terms
POD1000000044_S0000071	it changed my life direction
POD1000000044_S0000072	and for these kinds of radical results alvin was given a lifetime achievement award from the american psychological association
POD1000000044_S0000073	one psychology text book even goes so far as to describe alvin as being quote as important as freud
POD1000000044_S0000075	but this isn't a story about alvin's professional life his life inside the office this is a story about alvin's real life
POD1000000044_S0000076	he insisted i ran away
POD1000000044_S0000077	this is rachel alvin's daughter
POD1000000044_S0000078	and i i did
POD1000000044_S0000079	how old were you
POD1000000044_S0000080	i was in grade five
POD1000000044_S0000081	the year was nineteen-seventy alvin and rachel's mom had been locked in an ugly custody battle for eight years
POD1000000044_S0000082	rachel's mom was poor and struggled with depression rachel really wanted to live with her dad so when alvin suggested she ran away from judy and denver to his house in ohio rachel didn't pack a bag she didn't say goodbye to anyone
POD1000000044_S0000083	she just left
POD1000000044_S0000084	like he set up this whole thing with his lawyer and i just felt like i needed to do what my dad and the lawyer told me and this was the right thing i think i said it was going to the library and
POD1000000044_S0000085	somehow i don't remember how i got to the lawyer's office and then they took me to the airport and put me on the plane and i left
POD1000000044_S0000087	alvin had gotten remarried to a woman with two kids and rachel loved feeling like she was a part of this happy family there were dogs to play with and bikes to ride and yet this other feeling would often creep in
POD1000000044_S0000088	i miss my mom i miss my friends i miss my cat but i could never ever ever say that out loud to anybody
POD1000000044_S0000089	and there was someone else rachel missed missed most of all
POD1000000044_S0000091	she told us she was going to the library and then she never came back
POD1000000044_S0000092	this is rachel's brother john he's two and a half years younger than rachel and only has flashes of early childhood memory about alvin
POD1000000044_S0000093	he recalls doing father-son things that would make perfect sense if the son was an adult things like lifting weights together and smoking
POD1000000044_S0000094	he was a pipe smoker he bought me my own little cherrywood pipe and you know as a four-year-old he actually had me smoking you know tobacco in the pipe with him
POD1000000044_S0000095	it was as though alvin couldn't distinguish between adults and children which was why he saw john's closeness with his mom not as a child's natural maternal attachment but rather as a personal slight
POD1000000044_S0000096	and so alvin never ask john to run away john was left behind in denver with judy
POD1000000044_S0000097	i think in his mind i just you know was more a mama's boy and a chip off judy's block and i think he's sort of gave up on me and he he was really focused on rachel
POD1000000044_S0000098	and as the final custody hearing approached alvin's focus on rachel intensified he wanted to prove to the court that rachel was better off him so he had about a half dozen social workers and psychologists offer assessments
POD1000000044_S0000099	rachel was interviewed and alvin's new family observed none of the experts spoke to judy and the plan worked
POD1000000044_S0000100	in the autumn of nineteen-seventy a judge ruled that rachel would be allowed to stay in ohio with al for good but john would remain in denver with judy
POD1000000044_S0000101	and we never live together again
POD1000000044_S0000103	when you have a sibling who is just a critical part of your family and then you're separated from them its a wound
POD1000000044_S0000104	how uncommon was something was an arrangement like
POD1000000044_S0000105	extreme yeah very very uncommon kids are not split up
POD1000000044_S0000106	we each grew up alone i missed her through my whole childhood i missed her a lot
POD1000000044_S0000107	i mean we were we were so close when we were young and you know she was the big sister who threw all of that was looking out for me
POD1000000044_S0000109	growing up from then on just me and my mom grew up as an only child and my mom just always being in pain and
POD1000000044_S0000110	she never was able to enjoy whatever it is we were doing at the moment it was always always oh if only rachel were here we could all be together and i'd be saying but but we're here now
POD1000000044_S0000112	when he turn thirteen john invited rachel to his bar mitzvah but alvin wouldn't let her go rachel sent a poem instead
POD1000000044_S0000113	it had to do with the rubber band stretching across the distance and connecting us
POD1000000044_S0000115	for john not only did he lose his big sister he also lost his dad year after year john tried to re-enter alvin's life but each time he reached out alvin rebuked him
POD1000000044_S0000116	one time as an adolescent john tried scheduling a visit
POD1000000044_S0000117	then he said well as long as you guys you know me and my mom required any money any child support there'd be no visit
POD1000000044_S0000118	and i said well it sounds like you care more about money than about me and he said well i don't want it to just sound like that that's how it is
POD1000000044_S0000120	nevertheless a few years later john asked once again if he could come visit by this point rachel was eighteen and no longer living with alvin
POD1000000044_S0000121	so when alvin refused john yet again rachel told her brother to come visit her instead they hadn't seen each other in eight years were she the same sister that you remembered
POD1000000044_S0000122	um no i mean i knew her as a you know
POD1000000044_S0000124	yeah six seven eight nine ten-year-old next time i saw her she was an adult
POD1000000044_S0000126	in the year since that visit rachel and john have made a point of staying in each other's lives they talk on the phone celebrate holidays together and once a year their families all take a trip but the childhood together that's been lost
POD1000000044_S0000127	i mean my daughter certainly watches us and thinks that we're more like cousins ah she can see that the disconnect cause we did not grow up together
POD1000000044_S0000128	john and rachel still have questions about their childhood but now that their parents are both dead they have no one to ask so they parse through their separate memories trying to construct a timeline comparing moments of overlap and filling in the blanks
POD1000000044_S0000129	to this end one night while john was visiting rachel for thanksgiving he asked if they could go through alvin's files
POD1000000044_S0000131	alvin was an obsessive record keeper and after he died rachel inherited his papers she never really gone through them keeping them stored away in a filing cabinet but that night she pulled them out
POD1000000044_S0000132	and together john and rachel made a series of disturbing discoveries the first of which was the script
POD1000000044_S0000134	the script for me was like oh my god
POD1000000044_S0000136	the script was a lengthy diatribe written by alvin from the point of view of the child rachel's point of view
POD1000000044_S0000137	in it alvin refers to himself as daddy judy as mother or judy or simply she i later asked rachel to read some over the phone
POD1000000044_S0000139	two and a half pages long and small psychologist writing okay so here i go with in my good happy dreams custody is changed and i live with daddy
POD1000000044_S0000140	if i am forced to go back and live with mother it will only be till the day i'm fourteen which apparently was when you could decide
POD1000000044_S0000141	um when i'm with her i feel scared that i might get tight and angry and cold like judy she is not a mother she is a keeper she makes me feel like i'm in a prison i can't let her touch me
POD1000000044_S0000142	it was like finding a childhood internal monologue committed to paper and written in your father's handwriting rachel didn't remember seeing the script as a kid but she remembered saying those things and she remembered thinking them
POD1000000044_S0000143	in one of alvin's many books a volume entitled the manual of optimal behavior he writes that the behavior can be rehearsed and modified quote until you are ready and eager to go ahead and do what you've rehearsed and modified
POD1000000044_S0000144	unannounced to her alvin was having rachel rehearse and modify
POD1000000044_S0000145	it was so
POD1000000044_S0000147	explicit if there was nothing subtle about it you know the whole thing was sick
POD1000000044_S0000149	the second thing discovered among the files was a letter from rachel to her mom in it she begs judy to let her live with alvin but there were two copies one written in rachel's hand and one written in alvin's
POD1000000044_S0000151	going through the papers rachel remembered other things how alvin encouraged her not to smile when she was with her mom saying if someone photographed her happy it could be used as evidence against him in court
POD1000000044_S0000152	in every photo from that period with her mother rachel is wearing a frown
POD1000000044_S0000153	that's when i started questioning and started to realize that i was coached to brainwashed
POD1000000044_S0000155	it made sense for most of her adult life rachel had had no memory of loving her mom it was only after her mother's death when she found mother's day and birthday cards she'd written to judy when she was very small
POD1000000044_S0000156	that rachel realized she had i love you mommy she'd written i love you so much but with else constant coaching it had all been stamped out
POD1000000044_S0000158	the final thing john and rachel found that night were those psychological reports alvin had rachel submit to just before the final custody hearing in them you see alvin scripting bear out
POD1000000044_S0000159	one report notes that rachel kept repeating quote i want to live with my father he loves me my mother doesn't love me the report notes that she said this with quote grim determination
POD1000000044_S0000161	they also uncovered one particular report that night that was longer than any of the others it was the only one that evaluated both john and rachel and in this it carried the most weight
POD1000000044_S0000163	and what shocked john and rachel most of all
POD1000000044_S0000164	my dad clearly edited edited it and then she rewrote it with the edits and submitted that rewrite
POD1000000044_S0000165	is that ethical as a social worker
POD1000000044_S0000166	oh no no no no no no it's not no oh no no no no one would should ever let anybody else especially their client edit their reports no it's it's really bad
POD1000000044_S0000167	the report was written by a social worker named joyce
POD1000000044_S0000169	alvin said it's the joyce's report made the language more emphatic for example where joyce had written that rachel was hesitant when it came to judy alvin changed it to say she was fearful in another spot
POD1000000044_S0000170	he added that rachel wanted to blot out any memory of ever having been away from him
POD1000000044_S0000171	honestly i mean it was horrifying you know just to see the detailed notes to see the edited drafts the cross outs in his handwriting
POD1000000044_S0000172	um and then the final version that was submitted to the courts with his edits in there like there's no question and what happened
POD1000000044_S0000174	the report concludes with a recommendation the strongest one of any report and the only recommendation of its kind
POD1000000044_S0000175	she recommended that i live with him and that my brother live with my mom
POD1000000044_S0000176	john and rachel separation came down to a decision dictated by alvin and signed off on by joyce
POD1000000044_S0000178	how is alvin able to exert this kind of power over a social worker someone who's supposed to be an impartial outsider john and rachel couldn't understand it
POD1000000044_S0000179	but that night when rachel googled joyce she was shocked to realize that joyce hadn't been an impartial outsider at all joyce was a family friend
POD1000000044_S0000181	rachel recognized joyce as the kind dark haired woman whose house she visited as a child
POD1000000044_S0000182	rachel would bring her cello over to play music with joyce and her family which means that on top of everything else wrong with the report joyce should have never been the person to write it in the first place
POD1000000044_S0000183	she was like the one person in my life as a kid who could have said hey i think you are coaching her and this isn't right
POD1000000044_S0000184	why are we gonna trying to put these kids up she was the one who could have said something
POD1000000044_S0000185	in nineteen seventy joyce recommended that my sister go with my father and that i go with my mother and that's what happened
POD1000000044_S0000187	and that dictated the course of my life what happened
POD1000000044_S0000189	this is the question that's been nagging at john and rachel's since they found the report how could this have happened and so john and rachel want to find joyce and ask her
POD1000000044_S0000190	but i don't fully understand though is what i have to offer rachel and john are both practicing therapist themselves they're more than capable of posing difficult questions
POD1000000044_S0000191	and although i play a mental health semi-professional semi-convincingly on a podcast i'm not actually one at all what what can i do
POD1000000044_S0000192	well ah so i have had to advocate for myself my entire life from a very young age and nobody advocated for me or my brother
POD1000000044_S0000193	and so if you could help me with this it would be a healing piece for me that somebody else advocated for me
POD1000000044_S0000195	after the break in search of joyce

POD1000000044_S0000238	it was a quick shoot there wasn't a rehearsal per say we just kinda went in and and improvised
POD1000000044_S0000239	this is bob and performance wise bob has done it all
POD1000000044_S0000240	juggled swords cracked whips eaten fire i've done for ten years i did stage hypnosis show
POD1000000044_S0000241	bob is a regular renaissance man in that he also worked at a renaissance fare when bob showed up to film that day he was asked to improvise some sort of marital problems that alvin could help solve by bringing his method to bare
POD1000000044_S0000242	i asked bob if he found alvin's behavior domineering but bob doesn't recall much there is one thing though that bob does still recall even thirteen years later it seems bob wasn't alvin's first choice of patient
POD1000000044_S0000243	he had had someone else do it before i think it was an african american lady and that didn't go the way it needed to do you know what i mean
POD1000000044_S0000244	um can can can can you elaborate
POD1000000044_S0000245	he showed it to me briefly
POD1000000044_S0000246	bob describes the video alvin showed him before they started filming that day in it the set-up was the same as it was for bob's shoot alvin was in an armchair his legs up in an ottoman except this time
POD1000000044_S0000247	in the armchair beside him was the actress like bob the actress in the video had been asked to come up with a marriage problem but in doing so the actress went to a darker place and alvin anticipated describing a husband who is vicious and cruel
POD1000000044_S0000248	nonetheless alvin tried to offer counsel
POD1000000044_S0000249	he was saying things like when he behaves in this way can you be playful about it and the actress said things like when he calls me names suggesting that he might be in so much borderline of rarely ah verbally abusive
POD1000000044_S0000250	it seems there was the way the actress was given to talking about an abusive relationship and then there was the way that alvin preferred her to talk about one and so the actress was replaced and bob was shown a video to illustrate what alvin did not want
POD1000000044_S0000251	it's if you know i i i get the message i guess
POD1000000044_S0000253	still not having received a response from joyce i decided to mail a letter and just a few days later i found an e-mail in my inbox in it joyce tells me she is not sure how much help she can be
POD1000000044_S0000254	she reminds me that it has been fifty years but she says she is willing to try she concludes the e-mail by saying please feel free to contact me if you wish joyce
POD1000000044_S0000256	hello

POD1000000044_S0000266	john is seated in a chair his posture upright rachel's sitting back on a couch
POD1000000044_S0000267	go ahead and talk a little bit what did you have for breakfast

POD1000000044_S0000269	me too
POD1000000044_S0000271	i can see the joyce is in the zoom waiting room waiting
POD1000000044_S0000272	back in my day a waiting room had all kinds of stuff to keep you occupied like lukewarm water you could drink from a paper cup or twenty year old copy of vogue but now waiting rooms are so metaphysical there's nothing to do in them
POD1000000044_S0000273	i suggest we let joyce in
POD1000000044_S0000274	okay
POD1000000044_S0000275	yeah okay okay huh yeah let's let's do it
POD1000000044_S0000276	joyce appears on the screen wearing a bright blue sweater and a colorful ascot that gives you the effect of a fun grandmother standing beside joyce is a middle-aged man who i assume is her son he's helping her get set up
POD1000000044_S0000277	hello
POD1000000044_S0000278	oh hello
POD1000000044_S0000280	joyce and her son frown at the computer it seems they're having sounds issues there's a long moment in which we all look at each other in silence and then
POD1000000044_S0000282	joyce settles into an armchair
POD1000000044_S0000283	ah well ah do do you all look familiar to each other
POD1000000044_S0000284	no ah well it's been a long time i'm rachel hi joyce
POD1000000044_S0000285	hi rachel
POD1000000044_S0000286	hi i'm john
POD1000000044_S0000287	you're john
POD1000000044_S0000288	so ah joyce do do you ah i know john and rachel are curious about just how much you remember maybe maybe ah
POD1000000044_S0000289	virtually nothing
POD1000000044_S0000291	so i wasn't clear what what i can do for you i'm certainly willing to try
POD1000000044_S0000293	so i think what we're remembering from that time or what we know is that my dad and my mom were in a very i don't know if you remember bitter custody battle
POD1000000044_S0000294	and um there were so many court battles
POD1000000044_S0000295	and um one of the reports was done by by you so we wanted to talk to you about that and find out what you remembered about that
POD1000000044_S0000297	joyce inhales through clenched teeth shakes her head
POD1000000044_S0000298	ah i really don't know what happened um
POD1000000044_S0000300	we wanna ah we think our father it looks kind of everybody he met in a very heavy-handed way
POD1000000044_S0000301	yes i would certainly agree with that
POD1000000044_S0000303	you know say now was heavy-handed is an understatement
POD1000000044_S0000305	joyce's husband at the time was a colleague of alvin's that's how she first came to know alvin he and her husband both taught in the local university psychology department joyce says her husband would always come home with al stories
POD1000000044_S0000306	acting out at meetings um and ah shouting out inappropriate stuff so um he was very very controlling he he took control of any situation any social situation
POD1000000044_S0000307	one party at my house he was a guest along with the other members of the psych department and he just could took control of the whole evening
POD1000000044_S0000308	and of course the more people drank the more intense it got i think the focus was on people's dreams and dream analysis
POD1000000044_S0000309	for alvin a freudian this meant exploring each party goers dream for hidden sexual desires that he alvin could then expound upon in a roomful of colleagues
POD1000000044_S0000311	joyce relates the anecdote to illustrate the kind of guy alvin was but john hears something else in the story
POD1000000044_S0000312	so you all socialized
POD1000000044_S0000314	john is trying to remind joyce that she was alvin's friend that writing the report wasn't appropriate but the implication goes over joyce's head
POD1000000044_S0000315	the department wasn't a big one um and it was close knit and and ah everybody got together they you know
POD1000000044_S0000316	mhm
POD1000000044_S0000317	friday what do you do you hang out with the people that you know best and that was in the department um
POD1000000044_S0000319	what kinds of questions did you have ah that i can help with or that might get the answer or speculate about
POD1000000044_S0000321	you don't remember um evaluating us you don't remember having that roll
POD1000000044_S0000322	no
POD1000000044_S0000323	i guess i am curious if you remember um because i would have said also if like i wanna live with my dad and i love living here but i was coached
POD1000000044_S0000324	like don't smile if someone takes a picture of you with your mother
POD1000000044_S0000325	oh rachel oh rachel
POD1000000044_S0000326	did could you see that at all
POD1000000044_S0000327	no i i this is all news to me
POD1000000044_S0000329	did you do other custody evaluations was that a part of your practice
POD1000000044_S0000330	um that may have been one of the first ones and it was at his request that i i did that initially
POD1000000044_S0000331	it was at al's request you're saying
POD1000000044_S0000332	oh yeah yeah
POD1000000044_S0000334	do you remember any thoughts or feelings that
POD1000000044_S0000336	you know maybe it's not appropriate for me to evaluate someone that i socialize
POD1000000044_S0000337	no no not really because this was in the beginning of our arrival and so we weren't really socializing at that point
POD1000000044_S0000339	and at that point joyce and her husband had just arrived in town while her husband taught at the university joyce did not she hoped to some day but she was still fairly young
POD1000000044_S0000340	and at the time the only women in the psyche department were grad students and secretaries so when alvin this larger than like figure came asking for a favor it felt hard to say no
POD1000000044_S0000341	he was chair of that program
POD1000000044_S0000343	and you know i was i was new in town um i'm a people pleaser
POD1000000044_S0000345	so i think that that added to my my vulnerability to al
POD1000000044_S0000347	well i wanna make sure of that you know that um
POD1000000044_S0000349	your report recommends that we're split up
POD1000000044_S0000351	joyce takes off her glasses she places them in her lap
POD1000000044_S0000352	oh wow
POD1000000044_S0000354	i am sorry
POD1000000044_S0000356	i'm i never
POD1000000044_S0000358	would've done something like that
POD1000000044_S0000360	and hearing that i did i makes makes me feel terrible
POD1000000044_S0000362	so that's that's a surprise to you
POD1000000044_S0000363	it's total surprise and it's totally
POD1000000044_S0000365	against everything i believe
POD1000000044_S0000367	it's horrifying i i don't know what prompted it or what precipitated it
POD1000000044_S0000369	i i don't know
POD1000000044_S0000371	i'm sorry
POD1000000044_S0000373	but of course there is more
POD1000000044_S0000374	you know we can see al crossing out words and phrases
POD1000000044_S0000376	that you wrote and then re-writing them in stronger language
POD1000000044_S0000378	and then it's that stronger language that's in the final report
POD1000000044_S0000380	i'm appalled by that um
POD1000000044_S0000382	i hate to keep repeating myself but i'm truly sorry that that happened and had terrible consequences
POD1000000044_S0000384	i have a stomachache i feel terrible that it turned out that way i feel awful but i had a part in that
POD1000000044_S0000386	or that i am perceived to have had what i did i mean i can't say i didn't if i wrote it
POD1000000044_S0000388	this is something joyce does a few times she'll start to say something like if i did this but then she'll correct herself rachel has the report standing by to hold to the camera so joyce can see it for herself see her own signature
POD1000000044_S0000389	but that never becomes necessary even though she doesn't remember joyce believes john and rachel and so she doesn't cop out or equivocate
POD1000000044_S0000391	if i if i did something like that or because i did something like that
POD1000000044_S0000393	i am so sorry you guys there is anything i can do to mitigate in some small way
POD1000000044_S0000395	and it means a lot that you say that
POD1000000044_S0000396	oh yeah yeah
POD1000000044_S0000397	and it it it it's not just words it's it's it's heartfelt it's really heartfelt
POD1000000044_S0000399	and do do you have any idea why he why he might have turned to you
POD1000000044_S0000400	well to control the outcome i think
POD1000000044_S0000402	um
POD1000000044_S0000404	he was more comfortable with women because he could push them around
POD1000000044_S0000406	did you feel used
POD1000000044_S0000408	by him
POD1000000044_S0000410	well i guess he was using me so yeah
POD1000000044_S0000412	joyce says the relationship with alvin was short-lived the end came soon after joyce invited alvin and a few of her psychologist friends to join her private practice they accepted and all began working out at her office
POD1000000044_S0000413	and we did that for a while and then they decided that it wasn't appropriate to have a social worker in their practice so um they asked me to leave
POD1000000044_S0000414	and it was at al's instigation instigation um
POD1000000044_S0000416	what he said to me was it's not that you're incompetent
POD1000000044_S0000417	it's just that i don't know that you're competent
POD1000000044_S0000419	and you know for me to remember this fifty years later says a lot doesn't it
POD1000000044_S0000421	so this was him kicking you out of the practice
POD1000000044_S0000422	my my
POD1000000044_S0000424	my practice
POD1000000044_S0000425	your practice
POD1000000044_S0000427	i remember you like very very very fondly
POD1000000044_S0000428	well you're you're kind you're kind you're kind
POD1000000044_S0000429	you're a nice lady you are a good person and i see that now too i mean i had every reason to feel that way
POD1000000044_S0000431	rachel will later tell me that because of the way her dad brainwashed her she often can't trust her memories so it feels good that her memory of joyce is correct joyce is nice but rachel is nice too and can sense how badly joyce's feeling
POD1000000044_S0000432	you know i think my dad was so controlling
POD1000000044_S0000433	and i have to think that my dad coerced you and really pressured you to do that
POD1000000044_S0000435	thank you
POD1000000044_S0000437	you know hopefully you can tell rachel and i are are okay
POD1000000044_S0000438	we're really good parents we're close to our children we did not replicate any of this
POD1000000044_S0000439	now that's wonderful i'm so glad to hear that
POD1000000044_S0000440	and i've been with my wife thirty-seven years and thankfully now you know rachel and i came back together on her own and i'm very close with my sister
POD1000000044_S0000441	oh i'm so glad i'm so glad
POD1000000044_S0000443	damage done to us can often become damaged we do to others and on it goes but watching john and rachel i'm struck by the way they're breaking that cycle not just in their lives but right here in the room
POD1000000044_S0000444	well the zoom room
POD1000000044_S0000445	just to be clear joyce um i really appreciate what you're saying and
POD1000000044_S0000446	really really important to me that others just own and acknowledge their role in in any any dynamic
POD1000000044_S0000447	and in any interaction if they do that i'm good and al never
POD1000000044_S0000449	i tried in different ways
POD1000000044_S0000450	he would never owned any culpability responsibility anything
POD1000000044_S0000451	when john first became a psychologist he'd see alvin at various conferences where alvin was received as a star
POD1000000044_S0000452	for john it always occasioned a weird mix of pride in his father's career and bitterness over his personal rejection
POD1000000044_S0000453	at one conference john attended alvin's lecture in the hope of forcing his father to talk to him
POD1000000044_S0000454	alvin saw john and the audience but afterwards made him wait on line along with all his adoring fans eventually john grew frustrated and left
POD1000000044_S0000455	it's one of the mysteries of my life how he justified or rationalize to himself you know having a son and and supposedly loving him
POD1000000044_S0000456	and then just cutting him off and rejecting him for the rest of your life i don't i can't fathom that at all
POD1000000044_S0000458	there was a um an e-mail exchange over seven or eight months where i endeavored to answer that question that lifelong question of you know why
POD1000000044_S0000459	and he just kept trying to sell me his books and you know became this refrain have you read my book have you read my book and i'd say if you would like me to read your book
POD1000000044_S0000460	send me a copy and i will read it no he wants me to buy a book he wanted me to buy a book
POD1000000044_S0000462	in his e-mails the john alvin wrote that it was a sophomoric myth that a parents should seek relationships with one's child i do not accept silly pop psychology truisms he wrote
POD1000000044_S0000463	in the end of alvin's life john wanted to make one last effort to see his father so alvin could meet his grandkids
POD1000000044_S0000464	but rachel counseled john not to go she said that alvin would refuse to see him and was still so full of anger that he might even call the police
POD1000000044_S0000465	after his death alvin left behind a will with the section listing the names of those who wronged him each person was to receive a single dollar among them was john
POD1000000044_S0000466	back when i spoke to al's disciple howard he told me that al was bedridden at the end of his life yet he was still focused on his therapeutic method
POD1000000044_S0000467	just before he passed away ah when i visited him he said howard i'm working on becoming more of an optimal person i'm just doing it now and he was like so energetic
POD1000000044_S0000468	and and do you do you
POD1000000044_S0000469	from your perspective i mean did he achieve that kind of like an optimal personhood
POD1000000044_S0000471	he said he had
POD1000000044_S0000473	when i raised the subject of alvin's relationship with his kids in how that connected to his optimal self howard says he can't really speak to that alvin didn't bring up his kids much
POD1000000044_S0000474	there is a lot of stuff that goes on sometimes good and bad and you know that's just what happens in life ah we live and we adjust and do what we have to do
POD1000000044_S0000475	but i don't think whatever happens at a certain point in someone's life should define them for who they are as a person overall
POD1000000044_S0000477	ah can you come back in a little bit honey
POD1000000044_S0000478	a little girl barges into joyce's room she is wearing a lacy blue dress that's either a night gown or a cindrella costume

POD1000000045_S0000010	it is you you read so much you know so much about not just the reading side of things but now about the author and publishing side of things so i was getting so excited i can't wait for our talk today
POD1000000045_S0000011	me too i had so much fun looking through my list what i read this year to figure out what i was gonna bring so
POD1000000045_S0000012	yes we have so much ground to cover with books before we get to that tell us a little bit about what life looks like for you right now you know your are in awesome

POD1000000045_S0000014	so my husband and i live in north texas and he is working full time he works for the electric companies though he'd never got to stay home he had to go all the time
POD1000000045_S0000015	and i have a seven year old in first grade and three year about to be four year old and i just decided to home school them this year i have an education background i taught fourth grade for seven eight years and so
POD1000000045_S0000016	i just decided you know what i can't deal with the anxiety of the school's going back and forth and why not so i decided to home school so we're trying now for the first time this year which is interesting
POD1000000045_S0000017	other than that i do a lot of reading and i do a lot of writing and we're just kind of going with the flow of life
POD1000000045_S0000018	i am with you on going with the flow all of my kids are in seems like are doing different things
POD1000000045_S0000019	our oldest two are still enrolled in their regular school and they're doing all virtual they got to go back on campus
POD1000000045_S0000020	we try to open schools at ocma city they got to go back for two days two single days
POD1000000045_S0000021	we had to close down again the twins meanwhile who are in second grade i had pulled them out at the beginning of the year some like you with the younger kids i just didn't want to do the back and forth back and forth
POD1000000045_S0000022	so i also am homeschooling for the first time and it is an experience
POD1000000045_S0000024	but i think that you captured it perfectly with just like we gotta go with the flow so that's what we're doing
POD1000000045_S0000025	okay well you guys truly katie has picked out some very fun look that i want to tell you before we get our conversation later in the episode
POD1000000045_S0000026	whether you are a prolific reader and reading is your passion is your hobby and you've read a lot this year or truly like me you guys the main reason they went at this conversation with katie is because honestly
POD1000000045_S0000027	this is one of my worst years of reading ever i mean i know a lot of us maybe in that boat
POD1000000045_S0000028	he just has not been something i've been able to carve out time for this year in the midst of you know all of the other craziness
POD1000000045_S0000029	so katie has fixed some really cool things and so whether you are a prolific reader or viewer like me and you've been in a little bit of a slump i promise you katie has something on her list that you are going to love so we're gonna get to all that
POD1000000045_S0000030	and just a few minutes but katie let's go ahead and start the show the way we always do with our awesome of the week
POD1000000045_S0000031	if you're noticed what an awesome awesome of the week is the moment in the show where we like to stop talk whatever is awesome in life right now whether it's a book or t v shows sometimes it's a movie or a podcast or product
POD1000000045_S0000032	whatever bring a little joy that we need so much right now to our lives katie i can't wait to hear what you brought us the week
POD1000000045_S0000033	okay so mine is a beauty product and it's a all bright c serums so the vitamin c serum from beauty counter it is the most cutest little yellow bottle that you've seen
POD1000000045_S0000034	and the liquid that comes out is actually yellow because it has some heroic in it and so how does it really like nice earthy kind of smell but it's a vitamin c serum it goes just on after you plant intoe
POD1000000045_S0000035	and i swear this makes my face look instantly better like your skin goes from like boring to like bright and pretty in thirty seconds so it's my favorite product of all times right now
POD1000000045_S0000036	i will just testify so we're unsuited so i can see your beautiful face and you definitely do have a lovely glow about you so yeah i really testify that the stuff must work
POD1000000045_S0000038	if the great it's my favorite thing so far this year so
POD1000000045_S0000039	also i want to tell you guys too that katie liked had the bottle and she was showing it to me and i'm like oh that is a pretty yellow bottle i think i need to check this out
POD1000000045_S0000041	i'm sure you like me i mean i collect all kinds of serums and as what's gotten colder even in part the country where you and i live which is not like freezing but it's you know it's cold and dry air for us
POD1000000045_S0000042	i'm like where is the moisturizer please i need all the moisturizer right now everything is dry so okay tell us the name of the product one more time
POD1000000045_S0000043	so it's a beauty counter all bright c serum
POD1000000045_S0000044	okay perfect
POD1000000045_S0000045	beauty counter is technically an m l m company but i don't think you have to use a consultant so you can just order straight from their website and i will say it is a little pricey but you don't need much like i've had this bottle for probably six months
POD1000000045_S0000046	and i still have a good little bit left so it's just my favorite
POD1000000045_S0000047	i have noticed that with vitamin c serums to a little goes a long way for sure so we will have a link to katie's awesome in the show notes for you guys
POD1000000045_S0000048	okay my awesome of the week is seasonal i had something totally picked out that i was gonna talk about amnesty that for another day because just recently a brand new christmas album dropped because you guys know we don't have enough christmas albums in the world right
POD1000000045_S0000050	but the one that just drop that i'm so excited about is from dolly parton

POD1000000045_S0000054	i didn't but i just listened to her talk to bernie brown
POD1000000045_S0000056	yes i've been hearing so many good things about that interviews so i'm gonna put a link to both dolly parton's america and to that bernie brown interview in the show notes for you guys to check out
POD1000000045_S0000057	i think growing up in oklahoma no katie i'm a little bit older than you so going back a decade or so growing up in oklahoma in the eighties and the nineties
POD1000000045_S0000058	dolly parton was such a sceptic figure i feel like there's never been a time in my life and i didn't know who dolly was
POD1000000045_S0000059	so her music is really you know it's part of my childhood part of growing up years dolly parton's america is a fantastic podcast that i thought i love dolly before i listen to that
POD1000000045_S0000060	oh my gosh it and waxlike who this woman is how she came up in the industry the total feminist icon that she is that i never knew all these years you know underneath all the hair
POD1000000045_S0000061	and the costumes in her huge personality she has been so scrappy she's so smart as a business woman
POD1000000045_S0000062	she is amazing exactly like i feel like all of us know that but i cannot say it out
POD1000000045_S0000064	okay so here she is she's seventy-four years old traps a new album with a lot of original music on it
POD1000000045_S0000065	it's called a holly dolly christmas and it is so great so she has recorded a few on here that are just like your standard christmas music
POD1000000045_S0000066	she's got holly dolly christmas on here she also has you know like i saw mommy kissing santa claus she has mary did you know
POD1000000045_S0000067	this is in classics but then she does have original music that she has just written and recorded again the woman is in her seventies and still is making this incredible music
POD1000000045_S0000068	and the funding is is that she has a lot of duets on here as well so she's got a duet with like michael boo play which that's really expected for you know a christmas album
POD1000000045_S0000069	but did you expect miley cyrus to be on a christmas album
POD1000000045_S0000070	no that's interesting
POD1000000045_S0000071	yeah it really is and she also has another duet with miley cyrus billy ray on here
POD1000000045_S0000073	so it's really great you guys it's on spider fights on apple music amazon music all the places you listen to music you can find a holly dolly christmas i encourage you to look for the bonus version

POD1000000045_S0000110	all right katie i hope you're ready for me to just basically put the microphone in your hands and lead us through
POD1000000045_S0000112	what we're gonna talk about and just a little bit like i said katie did publish her first book this year it's a middle grade novel we are gonna talk all about that here in just a few minutes
POD1000000045_S0000113	so i definitely want you guys to stick around for that part the conversation i cannot wake katie for us to talk about what that has been like releasing a book in the year twenty twenty i'm sure that has been an experience too
POD1000000045_S0000115	but i thought you know what let's talk about what we might have missed in books and reading this year but i wanted to kind of break it down into categories
POD1000000045_S0000116	because we have thousands and thousands and thousands of women who listened every week so of course in a group that big there's gonna be you know certain kinds of readers so i thought okay let's think about like what are some of the categories of readers
POD1000000045_S0000117	because i know if i tell you a category i know i can count on katie to pick out a book for that readers so i picked out seven categories
POD1000000045_S0000118	i'm gonna throw the category at you you tell us what you think would be a good breed that something that you've picked up recently and speaking of picking it up recently
POD1000000045_S0000119	i thought the first category that would be fun would be like the buzz book reader this is the reader who loves to be in the loop on the books that everybody is talking about whether you hang out and like a facebook group is devoted to reading or you just like to have you know
POD1000000045_S0000120	i was gonna say at dinner parties whatever those were
POD1000000045_S0000122	if you dislike to chat with people about what you've been reading and you like a good book that everybody's been talking about katie what are some good picks for our readers who love buzz books
POD1000000045_S0000123	okay so the first one that came to mind for this category i just read in september i think and it is called the invisible life of addie larue
POD1000000045_S0000124	i had that go ahead sorry i got so excited that interrupted you already okay go ahead yes
POD1000000045_S0000126	the author is v e schwab this book has been everywhere it was a book of the month pick that's how i got it the cover is gorgeous in the black it's got these gold letters it's just beautiful
POD1000000045_S0000127	okay yes i have to tell you i got it as my book of the month pick and i have yet to open at katie sell me on this book
POD1000000045_S0000129	so basic set up is adam larue she lives in the seventeen hundreds she's in a french village outside the city with her parents she basically makes a deal with the devil
POD1000000045_S0000130	who she calls the darkness to get her out of this kind of sticky situation but the catch is that she will live basically forever and free
POD1000000045_S0000131	but that any time someone sees her once they turned their back on her they totally forget she ever exist
POD1000000045_S0000132	so this story bounces back and forth between the seventeen hundred and then two thousand fourteen where somebody remembers her for the first time in her three hundred years of life
POD1000000045_S0000133	so that for our story bounces off from there and i just loved it the writing is absolutely gorgeous the experiences that she has i'm sure you can imagine they make for some really interesting you know meetings with people
POD1000000045_S0000135	they forget her immediately and so i just really loved that there's a lot of art and literature and writing kind of built into the story to that just i loved it
POD1000000045_S0000136	okay i feel so proud of myself that even in a year when i'm not connected to reading i actually picked a look that everyone is talking about so there you go maybe over the christmas break will have a little time to finally crack it open and read it
POD1000000045_S0000137	yes i've heard the audio is very good too that is not how i read it but i've heard that it is very good on audio as well so
POD1000000045_S0000138	perfectly perfect okay did you have any other picks for the buzz
POD1000000045_S0000140	one more and this was one of the ones that was up for best book of the year on good reads and this is called the girl with a louding voice by abi dare
POD1000000045_S0000141	it's also got a gorgeous cover this is a debut novel which i was like shocked for reading and because it's so good but this book follows a fourteen-year-old adunni and she is a nigerian girl
POD1000000045_S0000142	living also unlike the countryside and her father sells her into basically a marriage into this man's third wife and all she wants to do in her life is learn and read and be not somebody's wife or mother and so
POD1000000045_S0000143	the something kind of tragic happens in their household that forces her to leave where she is and she goes to the city to work to basically be an indentured servant for this other kind of a wealthy family
POD1000000045_S0000144	and so that's all i want a fake i don't want to spoil it but it is so good her english is a little rough in the beginning like you can see the transformation of her as she learns more which is great
POD1000000045_S0000145	but it does take a little bit getting used to that kind of dialect in the beginning but i didn't have too much of a problem with it i've also heard that truly good on audio if you want to listen to that
POD1000000045_S0000146	okay tell me the name of it one more time
POD1000000045_S0000147	it's called the girl with the louding voice by abi dare
POD1000000045_S0000148	okay those both sounds so good and yeah i love hearing those picks that it's like these are the books that all of the readers who are in the know this is what everybody is talking about
POD1000000045_S0000149	so i think i might actually maybe be like a secret
POD1000000045_S0000151	okay so the second category that i thought may be fun is something i think a lot of our awesome kid maybe relate to you and this is the stuck in a slump reader
POD1000000045_S0000152	this is a reader who usually does love to read but twenty twenty has just like sapped their energy and it has sapped the fun out of readings
POD1000000045_S0000153	so i'm wondering if you have a pic or two for people who again they're usually readers but this year they just kinda got stuck in a little bit of a slump when my snap us out of a slump
POD1000000045_S0000154	so when anybody asks me when they're gonna reading some what they should do i usually say two things i say pick a favorite reread which i can't bring to the show because i don't know all these people and what they want to reread
POD1000000045_S0000155	or i say pick a really sweet middle grade book and i know middle grade isn't for everybody but i feel like middle grade books are just so hopeful and sweet usually
POD1000000045_S0000156	and they're really easy to read like they're really fast so you can get through a story pretty quickly so i'm gonna tell about one middle grade book that i loved and then i'm also just gonna throw in another fine adult book just for in case we have middle grade for people who don't love middle grade
POD1000000045_S0000157	but one of my favorite middle grade books this year was called the lonely heart of maybelle lane by kate o'shaughnessy this was also a debut novel
POD1000000045_S0000158	maybelle is eleven and she is estranged from her father whose like a radio d j and she wants nothing more than to meet him and kind of have him know who she is
POD1000000045_S0000159	her mom leaves her with this neighbor woman while she goes to search for a job it's like over the summer and this neighbor actually happens to be one of her teachers from school
POD1000000045_S0000160	and so she kind of like kind this neighbor lady to take her to a singing contest where her father will be so that she can meet her dad
POD1000000045_S0000161	and then another boy from her school kind of accidentally tags along so they go on this road trip
POD1000000045_S0000162	they have these experiences that kind of one of those like make your own family kind of situations which i love a book about like ah come piecemeal family
POD1000000045_S0000164	yeah
POD1000000045_S0000166	that one was very sweet i loved that one
POD1000000045_S0000167	you know before you tell us your next pick i have to say and we'll talk about this when we when to get to your book that i love a middle grade novel and i think i really fell in love with them not even necessarily when i was in those middle grade
POD1000000045_S0000168	although it did certainly a lot of reading at the time but when i was working on my as of yet incomplete masters in libraries
POD1000000045_S0000171	like decades ago but i took a couple of young adult literature classes and so here i was as a young adult it was in my early twenties and i was assigned these middle grade novels and oh my goodness you are so right they are usually so engaging
POD1000000045_S0000172	so enchanting that action picks up from the beginning again because if you're thinking about a classical in a middle grade actual reader you gotta grab that attention right away and so there's not a lot of like
POD1000000045_S0000173	story set up and you know it really gets you right into the action at that is a perfect pick for if you're in a reading slump and you just want to pick up a book and just take off with it
POD1000000045_S0000174	i love that so i am a huge fan of the middle grade and again we'll talk a little bit more about that here in just a few minutes so what's another pick for the stuck in a slump reader
POD1000000045_S0000175	okay so this one is called the house in the cerulean sea by t j klune you've probably seen this cover all over the place too because it's been very popular this year
POD1000000045_S0000176	but it starts off with this man named linus baker and he works for a government agency and he gets sent on this kind of special assignment to this island there's an orphanage on an island
POD1000000045_S0000177	and there these kids and they all have these weird magical abilities so and they're not things that you're necessarily familiar with and one of the kids just its kind of a scary situation so he's a little bit nervous
POD1000000045_S0000178	he takes this cat with them he goes to this island and he stays at the orphanage and he supposed to be like sending reports back to the government agency about the orphanage and the man who runs the orphanage
POD1000000045_S0000179	but i picked this one for in a slump reader because it's just the sweetest most fun little fantasy book that it's just felt like i was getting a hug from this guy while i was reading this book so i loved it
POD1000000045_S0000180	tell me the name of that again
POD1000000045_S0000181	the house in the cerulean sea by t j klune
POD1000000045_S0000182	gosh what a gorgeous title that is too
POD1000000045_S0000183	yes
POD1000000045_S0000184	i loved that booth if you are stuck in a slump picks are feel good books because i do think sometimes especially if you find yourself is like an energy victim of twenty twenty like it's just as after energy
POD1000000045_S0000185	you may have some trepidation about starting a bit because like nobody wants more you know like hard stuff right now i got hard lives are hard enough as it is
POD1000000045_S0000186	but a feel good but i think you're right it can kind of unlock that oh my gosh now i remember why i love reading moment for people so
POD1000000045_S0000187	so great okay so here's another category to throw at us what would you recommend for the serious literature reader
POD1000000045_S0000188	the people who when they walk into a bookstore they head straight for that literary fiction shelf like serious reading katie what do you have for us
POD1000000045_S0000189	okay so my favorite one this year hands down was called the book of longings by sue monk kidd
POD1000000045_S0000190	and this one can be a little controversial because it follows the life of anna who is the fictional wife of jesus
POD1000000045_S0000192	did you tell me about this
POD1000000045_S0000194	i thought i know somebody told me to read this book this year and it was you okay yeah
POD1000000045_S0000195	and so we start off meeting anna she is kind of put into a precarious social situation that makes her kind of unmarriageable but jesus marries her
POD1000000045_S0000196	and so we get to see her life as his wife and she doesn't really talk too much about jesus as god like his divinity it's more about his humanity peace
POD1000000045_S0000197	and so to get to see that side of how she kind of interpreted how jesus the man would be with his wife and then she's also a writer which is why i love this book so much she has this really cool bowl
POD1000000045_S0000198	that she writes prayers inn and her dad gets her papyrus know she wants to write the stories of women that are forgotten basically so she has a collection of stories about women
POD1000000045_S0000199	so it kind of just follows her life throughout and i just loved it i thought it was so beautifully done and i just i just loved it
POD1000000045_S0000200	while sue monk kidd course you know like just such a treasure of
POD1000000045_S0000201	contemporary american literature so i can only imagine i remember you highly recommended this to me i've had other people say have you read the book is the book of longings
POD1000000045_S0000203	okay
POD1000000045_S0000204	the book of longings
POD1000000045_S0000205	yes i just have heard a lot of people like people appointed me in that direction so i feel like yes the stars are aligning for me to pick that went up
POD1000000045_S0000207	will say if anybody's uncomfortable with maybe like the content of this to there's a great authors note in the back where she kind of explains how she did it
POD1000000045_S0000208	katie cobb i'm currently reading is the reason i read this book in the first place and she's the one who suggested read the author's note first to see if that's gonna kind of make you feel iffy about it like faith wise but i didn't have any issue with it and i ended up really loving
POD1000000045_S0000209	good good good stuff okay any other literary fiction picks
POD1000000045_S0000210	okay so i also loved this tender land by william kent krueger this was technically published last year but i read at this year some an accountant i think it was kind of later in the year
POD1000000045_S0000211	so this was kind of like an odyssey retailing like odyssey meets huck finn if you will
POD1000000045_S0000212	interesting i like that
POD1000000045_S0000213	the main character is odie and his brother they are at one of those native american boarding schools they are not native american i don't remember how they ended up there but they are at the school
POD1000000045_S0000214	they have a good friend and then there's another little girl and something happens that makes them have to leave their school and so they are on this journey to search for odie and his brothers aunt who is in a different city
POD1000000045_S0000215	and they like take off down the river in a canoe and they meet all these different kinds of people and have all these experiences and i just really loved the scenery was gorgeous the story telling was gorgeous
POD1000000045_S0000216	it's not one of those like mismatched family kind of stories and i just really loved it so
POD1000000045_S0000217	okay that sounds so fascinating what a great context for a story to start again alike that
POD1000000045_S0000218	and awesomes too as you're listening don't worry about shutting any of these down we will put a full list in the show notes with links and also these categories
POD1000000045_S0000219	so if one of these stood out to you and you're like oh wait i'm most serious literature reader than you could go like right to the listed fight them with katie has picked for you so
POD1000000045_S0000220	okay so this is so great i have a few more categories the next one is this one i'm super personally invested and because this is totally mean delighted by non fiction reader
POD1000000045_S0000221	if i am reading a lot during the year i'm almost always reading a lot of nonfiction so we're talking memoir or biography i love essay collections
POD1000000045_S0000222	anything where its just really beautiful to read and it's also a non fiction i mean i also love my share of self help books as well
POD1000000045_S0000224	for those of us who get into the nonfiction every year katie what are your picks in that realm
POD1000000045_S0000225	okay so one of the best ones i read this year was called after the last boarder two families and the story of refuge in america by jessica goudeau
POD1000000045_S0000226	this one is incredible she's a journalist and writer who works closely with refugees that live in austin texas and she worked really closely with these two women
POD1000000045_S0000227	the first one is named mu naw and she's from myanmar and her family came with her to austin that was in the early two thousands and then hasna came from syria with her family
POD1000000045_S0000228	more recently and so she tells these stories of these women kind of in a chronological order of where they were or how they came to get here what happened to their families along the way
POD1000000045_S0000229	and then she intersperses it with more informational chapters about the u s immigration and refugee policy which i found very interesting as i don't feel like i knew a lot about this
POD1000000045_S0000230	that's one of those topics that people like to talk about but i don't know that they know much about it so i really appreciated it read like a novel for me yeah i could not wait to sit down again and pick up these women's stories
POD1000000045_S0000231	you know their resilience and their courage and i just thought it was really good i want everyone to read it
POD1000000045_S0000232	i have had that on my list since the first day i've heard about it before it actually published obviously refugee issues and refugee policy in america is close my heart we did a whole episode on that way back at the beginning of twenty seventeen
POD1000000045_S0000233	when i was just researching for that episode which we had to do a really quick turnaround from that i learned so much was like oh my gosh i had no idea about any of this and
POD1000000045_S0000234	so i have had this book on my list for so long i'm so glad you brought it up because i absolutely want to dig into that when very soon after the last boarder so
POD1000000045_S0000235	another one for nonfiction and this one is a little bit lighter it's not have information heavy but this one's called the native and it's by kaitlin b curtice
POD1000000045_S0000236	and she is a christian woman and she's also a member of the potawatomi nation and she kind of just has a lot of reflections on her christian faith and how that intersects with her native roots
POD1000000045_S0000237	and getting back to those you know stories and just her heritage and then how that kind of affects her christian faith as she goes through it i loved everything she talked about she talked about the church she talked about racial issues in the church and
POD1000000045_S0000238	you know inclusion and white supremacy and also just like her love for jesus and her love for nature and all the things and i really liked that one too
POD1000000045_S0000239	yes oh my goodness that sounds so intriguing to me and again of course growing up in oklahoma
POD1000000045_S0000240	there's this really strong intersection ah you know like a sort of standard american culture then also living side by side with the native american culture in the different nations that
POD1000000045_S0000241	we were moved to oklahoma like i just have the sort of familiarity with it but not enough to like really have done like a deep dive into how that all fits together with christianity especially christianity in america so
POD1000000045_S0000242	that sounds fantastic i love that
POD1000000045_S0000243	yeah it was really good i listened on audio and she reads it so it's really nice to hear her voice you know tell you her story and i really like that
POD1000000045_S0000244	yeah fantastic next category and stick a little bit of a turn into something a little fluffier may be because category number five i thought be fun to talk about the beach reader
POD1000000045_S0000245	since most of us missed our summer vacations this year and that might be when we pick up a lighter read to check out may be take to the beach or wherever we're traveling
POD1000000045_S0000246	katie what are some of those more like beachy reads that we missed out on this year
POD1000000045_S0000247	okay so i don't read a ton in this category but my first one is called beach read by emily henry and this one the title the little misleading cause it actually takes place at a lake but
POD1000000045_S0000248	the set up is that january is a romance writer she's in a writing slump she goes to stay at her father's lake house after he dies and then next door is actually her college writing author nemesis named gus
POD1000000045_S0000249	and he's also having some riders blocks so they kind of make this bet that she's gonna write like the next american novel he's gonna ride a rom com and they're gonna like flip back and forth and share notes and you know
POD1000000045_S0000250	it's cute and fine and sexy but there's also like a depth to it i don't love like just the flat because there is some grief and there are some ino betrayal and some kind of things that go into it
POD1000000045_S0000251	ah give it a little bit more like depth to the cute fun romance part so i really liked that one i thought it was fun
POD1000000045_S0000252	yes beach read is one that i actually did read this yeah and it is so good it's just what you exactly said it's so fun i flicked the dialogue in the back and forth between january and gus it's like so snappy and so good
POD1000000045_S0000253	so funny but you're absolutely right there is so much depth to each their backstories with their working through with their processing highly recommend that when i think emily henry is a great writer so yeah i love that one
POD1000000045_S0000254	okay another one that i like this year is called the happy ever after playllist by abby jimenez this one it's like a companion novel to her first one which i don't remember the title now but you don't have to read the first one so you can pick this one up by itself
POD1000000045_S0000255	so sloan is our main character she's an artist her life is kind of fallen apart and this dog likes and jumps into her car one day and she has to figure out whose dog this is and what's going on
POD1000000045_S0000256	and so she finds the owner of the dog and he's actually overseas for the next couple of months so she agrees to take care of the dog they communicate first like on text
POD1000000045_S0000257	and then she finds out who this guy is and he's pretty famous and so she's like i'm talking to famous guaranteeing carers dog
POD1000000045_S0000258	and so their relationship kind of starts over text and they meet and you know et cetera et cetera so i thought this one is really fun it's really easy to read there's lots of fun music
POD1000000045_S0000260	yes
POD1000000045_S0000261	so cute and fun and sexy
POD1000000045_S0000262	i mean if you are gonna give me a meet cute that involves a dog in your telling me music is interwoven in the story i'm like wow sounds like a book written for me so i could definitely pick that up too
POD1000000045_S0000263	okay next category is the expand my views reader so this is the reader who loves to read about experiences of other people
POD1000000045_S0000264	kind of outside their own context with their outside of maybe their religious beliefs or their cultural background
POD1000000045_S0000265	the reader who really takes up the promise that reading gives us that you can learn about like anything anything in the world you can learn people's perspectives you can learn about people's experiences
POD1000000045_S0000266	if you'd give it a chance when you're reading so what are some expand my views picks that you might have first katie
POD1000000045_S0000267	okay so the first one i want to highlight is called sitting pretty the view from my ordinary resilient disabled body by rebekah taussing
POD1000000045_S0000268	she is on instagram at sitting pretty and i love her instagram profile and all of her content so she's in this is kind of like a memoir essay collection
POD1000000045_S0000269	about a woman who's been in a wheelchair most of her life so she talks about things like dating
POD1000000045_S0000270	and working and her family life and how she was treated as a child and how people treat her in public and what happens when people try to help her too much when she doesn't want help
POD1000000045_S0000271	so she brings up a lot of important issues about abel of them and how she feels and her body she's really funny and gracious and i just really like that
POD1000000045_S0000272	i did this when on audio which she also reads and so just having that experience of her telling you about her life this is a really really good one
POD1000000045_S0000273	okay yes i have seen her instagram account before and i know that it has really
POD1000000045_S0000274	resonated with so many people i mean talk about expanding your views and help you to understand somebody else's perspective that's different from your own and so i bet that that is absolutely an incredible rate
POD1000000045_S0000275	and then i also for this category wanted to make sure that i talk about cast by isabel wilkerson this is one you probably seen everywhere to it's a big but isabel wilkerson is probably one of most brilliant women i've ever read in my life
POD1000000045_S0000277	she took ten years to research and write this book
POD1000000045_S0000278	wow oh my gosh okay
POD1000000045_S0000279	and her basic premise is that the way the united states has separated itself out by race she calls it a caste system and she kind of comparisons to india's caste system and also nazi germany is caste system
POD1000000045_S0000280	she brings him similarities and also differences between the two and then she talks about the history of racism in the united states and how it has evolved from slavery to mass incarceration and now to where we are with all of the issues
POD1000000045_S0000281	surrounding race in the country now so i really loved reading that even that was really hard i read it with a buddy which was good because we had to kind of process after each day
POD1000000045_S0000282	but its very readable it's not like a textbook she writes in a really like narrative the kind of way she tells all the stories of people you've never heard about like why haven't i heard this before
POD1000000045_S0000283	and so i just really liked that when i thought it was a very like mind opening kind of book so i wanted to
POD1000000045_S0000285	what a perfect to pick up in twenty twenty as this has come to the surface nationally and collectively for us again that's a great pick for this year for sure
POD1000000045_S0000286	so okay last category before i'm really turned them over to you to talk about your book and your publishing journey but before we do that i wanna talk about the reluctant reader now
POD1000000045_S0000287	a lot of us are parents maybe are more familiar with this phrase because maybe we have children who are reluctant readers they can't read but they just there really resistant to it
POD1000000045_S0000288	hey some of us that is still the case in adulthood some of us would maybe rather just turn on netflix and see what is on instead of reading i am wondering if you have a few pics for a reader that they could just pick up and not be able to put down
POD1000000045_S0000289	sure so when i was teaching fourth grade when i had reluctant readers might go to the winds like to hand him a graphic novel because graphic novels are so fine and i really love them as an adult too i love to look through the pictures and read the story
POD1000000045_S0000290	so my favorite graphic novel of this year is called when stars are scattered and it's written by omar mohamed and victoria jamieson it's a true story of omar and his brother hassan and they live in a refugee camp in kenya
POD1000000045_S0000291	and so it kind of tells you about their overall like daily life and then their process of going through the u n and then coming to america
POD1000000045_S0000292	but his brother is a person with disabilities and so he feels like he has to just take care of his brother all the time
POD1000000045_S0000293	and so it's a very sweet story about brothers it's very informative about refugees and that you know kind of the things that they have to go through and then it's really hopeful
POD1000000045_S0000294	cause it's middle grade and you have to be hopeful on middle grade so i loved it the illustrations are in the story are just so compelling i sat down and read the entire thing and it was so good
POD1000000045_S0000295	sounds fantastic i love it i love it
POD1000000045_S0000296	okay but if graphic novels aren't her thing something that i love to do when i'm feeling a little bit like i wanna read i pick up a why a fantasy because why fantasies are so fun and they usually have a series to go with them and you can read like five in a row
POD1000000045_S0000297	this one only has two and it's not necessarily a fantasy but it's an alternate history that the first one is called dread nation and the author is justina ireland
POD1000000045_S0000298	so the alternate histories that the civil war had to pause because zombies yes zombies were taking over
POD1000000045_S0000299	and so they took all these former slaves and children and put them in these training schools to basically kill the zombies that's their new job
POD1000000045_S0000300	so we have jane mckeene is our main character she is snarky and spicy and strong she's just like one of those character he wanna be friends with because she's great
POD1000000045_S0000301	she and others from her training school gets sent to this settlement out west and its kind of like a creepy like situation they get there and there like that things are not all as they seem here
POD1000000045_S0000302	and so the adventure kind of takes off from there now if you had asked me before reading as if i liked zombie books i would have said no
POD1000000045_S0000303	but i listen to this on audio and bonnie turpin reads it and she's like the queen of audio books in my opinion i love her
POD1000000045_S0000304	and i just got pulled in right away listen to the second one as soon as i could get my hands on it the sequel is just as good and it came out this year and that once called the deathless divide
POD1000000045_S0000305	and so there's tons of action tons of zombies you know there are some friendships situations and bangs it was really fun and i was surprised that i liked it but i really really loved it so
POD1000000045_S0000306	i mean isn't that just like the magic of books that a book exists that imagines a world
POD1000000045_S0000307	where's the civil war and also zombie
POD1000000045_S0000309	i love it that's incredible what a great pick that is and i think you're so right too i do a lot a lot a lot of reading via audio book
POD1000000045_S0000310	not all that but a lot and so you know anyone that is like ah i don't know if i wanna read but you are still doing your daily walks with your dog
POD1000000045_S0000311	or you're trying to get on the treadmill every now and again like any time when you have a little space you can fill it in with audio after you listen to sorta awesome you could put on an audio book and get some reading done
POD1000000045_S0000312	i don't think enough people put an emphasis in their lives that on the fact that you can totally read books via audio that's a very legitimate way to read so
POD1000000045_S0000313	well and i was like very anti audio book until the middle of last year because i hadn't really tried one i was like listen i'm gonna get bored like i'm gonna not focus again it was katie
POD1000000045_S0000314	as currently reading he was like i'm sad for you that you don't like audiobooks i was like fine i'll try one and i have probably listened to more audio books this year than i have done any
POD1000000045_S0000316	i love that yes
POD1000000045_S0000317	i also discovered that you can turn the speed up which i don't think a lot of people know if you're just like an audio book newbies you can turn to speed up as they read very slowly so
POD1000000045_S0000318	i have gotten myself to where i can listen at a pretty fast rate and still understand everything that they're saying and that's been really how i consume a lot of books
POD1000000045_S0000319	and i think correct me if i'm wrong i think katie cobb again and currently reading podcast has even said that's how she gets through so many books is if you listen on audio and if you just you even have to crank it up like crazy fast if you just knock the speed up just a little tiny bit
POD1000000045_S0000320	you will be amazed at how much more quickly you can get through a book and again since i do a lot of reading that's nonfiction i have no issues at all with just bump and that speed up cause i just couldn't get through whenever it is

POD1000000045_S0000345	okay katie twenty twenty has been a rough year but you had a big life moment happen when you published your first book is called my storied year
POD1000000045_S0000346	so let's see where should even start i would love to hear kind of where did the story come to you first of all give us a little snapshot of what my storied year is about
POD1000000045_S0000347	and then maybe tell us the story how did this story come into your life into your mind walk us through a little bit of how the process was from taking it from like oh i have this idea too now you can hold in your hands you wrote a book you're an author tell us everything
POD1000000045_S0000348	okay so my storied year starts with dragon stewart he's a seventh grader and he is dyslexic and he has a really hard life at home and he's got some bullying situations going on at school
POD1000000045_S0000349	but this year he has a new set of teachers and some new kids in his class and his english teacher who is my favorite really kind of pulls out the writer in him he's like a secret poet he has this journal that he carries around a writes poetry
POD1000000045_S0000350	and the otherwise doesn't really like to read or write because it's hard for him and he has counted the secret story that he doesn't really know if he should tell it or how he should tell it and so
POD1000000045_S0000351	through the year he kind of opened up to his friends more and then he's able to kind of reveal his story and so that's the basic premise of it
POD1000000045_S0000352	oh my goodness you have sent a copy is on the way to me i cannot wait again i love love love a middle grade novel and this just feel so heartwarming already just hearing how you set up the story
POD1000000045_S0000353	you've mentioned that you taught elementary was that kind of a jumping off point for you in terms of how this character came into your mind
POD1000000045_S0000355	so when i taught writing was my absolute favorite thing to teach i did a lot of extensive training on writing and a lot of the things that she does in the book there's kind of like little writing lessons along the way that you could do with your kids if you are homeschooling them or even teachers in the classroom
POD1000000045_S0000356	but a lot of those things i learned do my trainings and so i wanna support and like the whole writing is fairly almost for people you know how we put things into words and how our creativity kind of find out who we are and so
POD1000000045_S0000357	i wanted to pull in that aspect of it and dragon is really kind of a mixture of a lot of kids that i taught and i had some hard kids you're gonna teach for any amount of time you're gonna have some kids with some hard lives and so
POD1000000045_S0000358	he's a mixture of a bunch of different ones and i just had the beginning of my teaching i didn't understand these kids because that wasn't my life experience i grew up in a two parent household and
POD1000000045_S0000359	you know we were always financially stable and so i didn't struggle like that and so when i met these kids it was almost like i can't believe people like this exist you know i didn't have that context and so
POD1000000045_S0000360	i learned over the course of my years how to help you know these kids get through their daily lives and how to do things to help them and i wish i had done more and looking back you know you always wish
POD1000000045_S0000362	yeah
POD1000000045_S0000363	but dragon is just a mixture of all those kids so i wanted kids to be able to see that kids like this are real and that they do have real problems and how you know
POD1000000045_S0000364	they need support at school from their friends from their teachers i wanted to write it for teachers to see how you know they can be so important in these kids lives especially if their home life is not stable
POD1000000045_S0000365	another teacher might be there one adult that loves them and so i wanted to put that in the book too
POD1000000045_S0000366	yes yeah that is so true i mean teachers can have a huge impact on our lives sometimes not even an good way but definitely in positive ways
POD1000000045_S0000367	and i think that can happen at any point along our journey but i think those middle grade years or so tender and so formative and
POD1000000045_S0000368	when you have a teacher in your life that really sees you and is really able to help you to discover who you are that is absolutely in actual life changer so
POD1000000045_S0000369	yeah what a great contacts to set the story in as you have this idea in so obviously gonna be fiction in that fiction writing process and maybe this even differs depending on if you're writing children's or middle grade or why a or adult
POD1000000045_S0000370	do you fully write the book and then start to go to agents and publishers and say okay i have this thing or do you taught on the publishing and first and then go and write like what was the process like for you
POD1000000045_S0000371	so it's different for fiction and nonfiction which i didn't even know until i had kind of gone through but what happened with i wrote and it was new in this book that i wrote i wrote another manuscript
POD1000000045_S0000372	there's a huge writing conference in dallas fort worth called d f w con it's a big writing conference and
POD1000000045_S0000373	with your conference ticket you get ten minutes with a literary agent to pitch your work at that point i had a finished manuscript and when i was kind of researching the conference for fiction they want you to have a complete manuscript
POD1000000045_S0000374	before you ever contact anybody for non fiction it's a little bit different because they wanna make sure that they can sell the book before he go like write all of it they see if you have a platform and you write a proposal and all that stuff but the book doesn't necessarily have to be done
POD1000000045_S0000375	for fiction generally they want you to have a complete manuscript before you start pitching at anybody so i sat down with his agent i kind of gave her my elevator pitch about the book
POD1000000045_S0000376	and then she asked me to send her the full manuscript which is kind of the best thing that you can hear at a conference cause some people will say i'll pass on this or send the five pages or whenever she asked for the full thing
POD1000000045_S0000377	so i send it to her and then you know six eight ten months later she got i mean it's a long waiting process
POD1000000045_S0000378	because they have so many manuscripts that are coming into them and they have to read them and this woman actually ended up being my agent and i'm so grateful for her because she didn't just send back like i don't want this
POD1000000045_S0000379	she sent back a list of really helpful notes for revisions and she said if you wanna like revise and then resubmit i'll be happy to look at it again she was like i don't think we can sell it as it is right now but i'll be happy to look at it again
POD1000000045_S0000380	so i took her notes did a lot of things work with a professional editor and then send it back to her and then she agreed to represent me so that's kind of how that situation but that was like a yearlong process probably from start to finish
POD1000000045_S0000381	and then once she has it i still went back and re wrote it probably two or three times not a major re hall but just like these parts seem to be fixed
POD1000000045_S0000382	and then she started to shop it to publisher so she did the same thing i did to find an agent she had to send out yellow letters and samples and all that stuff to different publishers until we found one
POD1000000045_S0000383	my publishing journey's kinda like wacky because my publisher bought the first book that i wrote but then they said what else does she have so we sent her my storied year
POD1000000045_S0000384	and then they are like we honest publish this one first they felt like it was really timely and they wanted to get it out there
POD1000000045_S0000386	first and then the first book that i sold will actually come out in june so that's like totally a different book but they wanted to get this one out
POD1000000045_S0000387	is it a middle grade novel too
POD1000000045_S0000388	it's also middle grade and it's historical fiction so it's totally like on a different level than this one but yes
POD1000000045_S0000389	that is fastening i mean you say that the timeline was a little wacky but if i've learned anything from my friends who are authors it's that like the timelines always crazy like everything takes so long
POD1000000045_S0000390	and then sometimes you write the like i've had friends who are non fiction authors who write the whole thing submitted in the publishers i can we don't wanna do this after all i get i mean that there's always like so many twists and turns on the publishing journey
POD1000000045_S0000391	so i can only imagine yeah that every single one i'm sure how surprises along the way some may be are not so happy surprises but what has surprised you in a way that you really like this was a happy surprise about the publishing process
POD1000000045_S0000392	the thing that surprised me the most wasn't really happy with how long it took cause you know i'm like i wrote this book it goes get it out i didn't realise how long of a process that is from like hitting it from a raw draft to an actual book
POD1000000045_S0000393	but i think the thing that surprises me in the best way is that i have just met so many good people that like my editor is one of my favorite people she is gracious but she's tough and she's you know cut this you know
POD1000000045_S0000394	let's fix this part cause it's not quite working and i've just learned a lot about myself as a writer and about good writing and so that's been really really good
POD1000000045_S0000395	i also i wanna encourage anybody who's writing to find yourself a writing group and it doesn't have to be someone you meet with like my writing i found from sorta awesome we are in the sorta awesome writers
POD1000000045_S0000396	spin off group and someone was brave enough and just said hey who wants to be an a writing group and so we're all over the place like i'm in texas and there's one in new york and one in lebanon and one and you know connecticut
POD1000000045_S0000397	and we just all we send each other our work every weekend we have a voxer that we can process through all of our writing questions then you know the days there were like this is horrible why am i doing this we have a place for that so that's been really really helpful
POD1000000045_S0000398	oh my gosh that gives me chills i love that part of the story obviously

POD1000000046_S0000614	like crazy um but ah at the end of it's it felt like a like we were somebody's house like a house party where everybody's gotten super fucked up
POD1000000046_S0000615	ah so dave chappelle at the end ah just said ah cuz you can get a full d j and everything the setup was like chappelle show to be honest with you
POD1000000046_S0000616	so he could refer back he had him play random songs sometimes if something he's talking about and at the end he was like
POD1000000046_S0000617	he goes i want ah man i just wanna i wanna feel love with everybody i love all these people lets just all sing a song together and i was like what

POD1000000046_S0000619	we turns around asked the d j to play radiohead's creep
POD1000000046_S0000620	yeah
POD1000000046_S0000621	by radiohead and so all these strangers who we had all sat in the stall and got shit jammed in our faces and resolve fucked up eating barbecue i i i think
POD1000000046_S0000622	we had to watch tony hinchcliffe
POD1000000046_S0000623	he was great
POD1000000046_S0000624	i know
POD1000000046_S0000625	he was great i know you're not a fan and i was in everybody's great and he was he had the best set of the night so you know so
POD1000000046_S0000626	um with that we all sang this song with all these fucking strangers every fucked up and like it was an unbelievable night and you're just like
POD1000000046_S0000627	it was unbelievable the poetic there was something poetic about that because radiohead won't even play creep in their concerts
POD1000000046_S0000628	right right
POD1000000046_S0000629	they refused to
POD1000000046_S0000630	yeah yeah yeah
POD1000000046_S0000631	like something really beautiful about that happening like the way that it should have happened at an actual radiohead concert
POD1000000046_S0000632	but it never would've but then you're with chappelle like singing radiohead it's like ten million times better and ah joe rogan is looking at rogue
POD1000000046_S0000633	yeah joe rogan's is looking at chapelle like he wants like he's in love with him
POD1000000046_S0000634	he was just like he didn't even say anything for the second encore he was just looking at chapelle like you're amazing
POD1000000046_S0000635	ah yeah and and and every single person saying it right here's the thing i'm surprised that dave chappelle knew all the words to creep by radiohead like
POD1000000046_S0000636	nah man he's he's cool
POD1000000046_S0000637	ah ah yeah either way it was fucking rad and then everybody walks out there because you don't have phones and you are not allowed to take a picture of it
POD1000000046_S0000638	like no one will believe me what just happened but i think that's also the set up to where it's like hey man we're gonna do this thing it's a weird fucking time in the universe
POD1000000046_S0000639	and this is what it's gonna be your a part of it and you'll be able to tell the story
POD1000000046_S0000640	um luckily we've a show that reaches you know a gajillion people otherwise
POD1000000046_S0000641	no one knows about any of the shit that's going on we're like isn't that cool yes yes it is
POD1000000046_S0000642	also why it is that cool because of the phones not being there so people are allowed to say words they are not suppose to say which i am not gonna say it here
POD1000000046_S0000643	but they don't have the fear of cellphone you know picking up some part of the set that's taken out of context and than cause he's been burned many times before
POD1000000046_S0000644	they all they all have yeah yeah
POD1000000046_S0000645	that was that's the beauty of it like look there's no other way for us to do this so you don't have your phones
POD1000000046_S0000646	therefore you're going to get the comedy that you want to get that you used to get and that we want to give you right
POD1000000046_S0000647	without anyone else being involved than the people that paid for it wanted to be here and know exactly what they're getting into right

POD1000000046_S0001151	she really runs that shop um but ah a jessie and i were chatting about it the two best in the world in my opinion are chapelle and spielberg right like that's one and two in the world
POD1000000046_S0001152	yeah for the for the the sole reason of saying whatever like setting their brand very early enough not giving a fuck and literally saying i mean the the the rant that billberg went on
POD1000000046_S0001153	about women was legendary could he fucking do that if he didn't set that precedent like way back in the day where he is like i don't give a fuck what you to cancel
POD1000000046_S0001154	yeah yeah
POD1000000046_S0001155	cancel me and say miss chapelle they just do it
POD1000000046_S0001157	him it's bringing comedy back right and joe rogan was they would they used to say that about him but he's kind of not write like he's sort of backing off a little bit whereas billberg and chapelle are going full force no question saying whatever they want
POD1000000046_S0001158	right um
POD1000000046_S0001160	it's so funny your billberg he did this bit on ah other female kicker from vanderbilt

POD1000000046_S0001169	but that's the kind of shit i felt
POD1000000046_S0001170	um we should actually sent a camera crew over to your house to have you explain this to her tonight's and then i get along hat bab has never shaken his head faster it's so fucking funny

POD1000000046_S0001234	good afternoon
POD1000000046_S0001235	good afternoon
YOU1000000001_S0000001	hey guys randy with pete's r v t v here today today we're on our way to lone pine campground in malletts bay vermont
YOU1000000001_S0000002	we're going to ah show you how to back up a camper and put it on the site so ah we'll be there in just a minute and we'll catch up with you then
YOU1000000001_S0000003	hey here we are at beautiful lone pine campground they're nice enough to let us use the site today so i'm just gonna pull past my site we're going to be on site thirty-one
YOU1000000001_S0000004	i'm gonna hop out and ah take a look at the site and see where i want to put this camper and then we're gonna go right ahead back her on the site
YOU1000000001_S0000005	okay so what i've done at this point this is the easiest way to put your camper on the site cause i've driven past the site and i've got the site on the driver's side of the truck
YOU1000000001_S0000006	i do that on purpose so i can see ah where the slide side or the off door side of the camper's going
YOU1000000001_S0000007	'cause that is the side that we want to keep as far this way as possible to give us more real estate on the usable part of our site
YOU1000000001_S0000008	so if you can all at all do that when you pull up to your campsite try to keep the driver's side on the on the slide side not all the time you'll be able to do that but if you can ah it's definitely going to work in your benefit
YOU1000000001_S0000009	so this point i just kind of walk the site and see what i've got to that i've got to avoid or if there's any trees in the way we see we've got a big stump here i see my power pedestals over here
YOU1000000001_S0000010	so i'm gonna wanna keep my camper um keep in mind that i've got a slide that's gonna go out but i want to keep my camper as far this way as possible to give me as much real estate on that side as i've mentioned before
YOU1000000001_S0000011	so this looks like a pretty open site which most campsites are we've just gotta contend with the stump there
YOU1000000001_S0000012	my power cord is gonna be in the back so that will work out perfectly for me so i guess what i'm going to do now is just hop back in the truck and ah see if we can negotiate this guy on the site
YOU1000000001_S0000013	okay so i'm gonna pull ahead just a hair and i'm going to ah kind of put the tail on my camper headed in the right direction that i want to back this guy up on
YOU1000000001_S0000014	now very important at this point is remembering that our wheels are pivot point for our camper so that's where the camper is gonna turn
YOU1000000001_S0000015	so i don't want to watch the front of the camper or the back so much i want to keep my eyes on the wheels so here we go
YOU1000000001_S0000016	and sometimes when i'm driving a different truck this truck's working out pretty well but sometimes i'll even angle the mirror down so i can see the wheels a little bit better
YOU1000000001_S0000017	want to make sure i got nothing going on on the other side of me
YOU1000000001_S0000019	and i'm just letting the camper kind of do the job here keeping an eye on both mirrors and obviously turn the steering wheel the opposite way that you want the unit to go
YOU1000000001_S0000021	and as you start getting close to where you want to be straight that's when you want to start counter steering
YOU1000000001_S0000023	we're getting the unit on there pretty straight nothing on the other side
YOU1000000001_S0000025	well i think i'm gonna hit this one pretty good right off the bat
YOU1000000001_S0000027	now if you're finding that you're not backing on straight or you know that the camper just keeps jackknifing on you a little bit
YOU1000000001_S0000028	maybe don't have enough room in front of the truck to ah get the truck out where you need it to to get you straight
YOU1000000001_S0000029	you always can put the truck back in drive and pull forward and straighten the trailer out
YOU1000000001_S0000030	so if you've gone too fat too far past and the camper's going the wrong way or the the back end of the camper is gone too far the way you don't want it to go
YOU1000000001_S0000031	simply put the truck in drive and pull straight ahead and that's gonna straighten the unit out for you so we're gonna just back this guy up here
YOU1000000001_S0000033	i think i hit my mark
YOU1000000001_S0000035	now this is ah the point where if you've watched my ah leveling video is where you want to get out and check the camper for level so that's what we're gonna do right now
YOU1000000001_S0000036	okay so that first time went very easy because there's not a whole lot of people in the park so now i'm gonna try to simulate a full park with cars and campers on my other side
YOU1000000001_S0000037	i'm gonna try to keep my vehicle on the road without going on the lawn over there like i did on the last ah pull in
YOU1000000001_S0000038	so this time i'm going to start backing up a little bit sooner
YOU1000000001_S0000039	so i've just got my camper kind of headed and you can see like with the camper headed it's gonna start to turn even with my truck straight
YOU1000000001_S0000041	and the camper is just starting to turn more and more so i'm gonna compensate just a hair now for it
YOU1000000001_S0000043	now i'm really gonna jackknife this camper
YOU1000000001_S0000045	try to swing this thing around now i can start to turn my truck a little bit
YOU1000000001_S0000047	so i've stayed on the road for the most part i've got my camper pretty straight
YOU1000000001_S0000048	but you see the back of the camper still wants to swing around cause i don't have enough room in front of the truck to get to where i want to go
YOU1000000001_S0000049	this is where people mostly run into trouble so i've got a trick for this too
YOU1000000001_S0000050	by keep backing up my ah back end of my camper it's just gonna keep swinging where i don't want it to swing
YOU1000000001_S0000051	a lot people will go back and forth and back and forth and they never find that happy spot so what i'm gonna do at this point is i'm just gonna stop the truck right here
YOU1000000001_S0000052	and i'm gonna unhook the camper sounds crazy but this would get you out of a pinch in a second
YOU1000000001_S0000053	okay so as you can see we turned off the camera um i'm back
YOU1000000001_S0000054	i unhooked the truck from the camper i re-situated my truck so now my truck is straight in line with the camper
YOU1000000001_S0000055	and we can continue to back up on the site and now we're not gonna be jackknifing or having the camper ah off angle on our site because i've now straightened the truck out and that was our problem
YOU1000000001_S0000056	so i'm gonna hop back in the truck and finish backing up on the site and we're gonna be good to go here okay so here we go back up for our final destination
YOU1000000001_S0000057	you got somebody with you behind you to keep the an eye out not a bad idea
YOU1000000001_S0000059	that looks good right about there so at this point i'm gonna get out and ah do a couple of the checks that i like to do just to make sure i've got enough room
YOU1000000001_S0000060	ah we know we've got our stump here so i'm gonna do my arm check we've got plenty of room there
YOU1000000001_S0000061	i'm right off my electrical box my electrical cords gonna be here so i'm within my twenty-five feet here i think this looks like a great spot
YOU1000000001_S0000062	i'm gonna ah run the slide out out and ah put the ah check the levels on the front of the camper and see if we're level and then we're gonna take it from there
YOU1000000001_S0000063	so in a nutshell a lot of people get intimidated by this it's a really simple process ah don't care about anybody watching me i'm just focused on what i'm doing
YOU1000000001_S0000064	does take a little bit of practice you're not gonna hit the mark on the first time out but the more and more you do it and the less you worry about other people watching you the easier it's gonna be for you
YOU1000000001_S0000065	so ah just follow my quick steps make sure you watch your wheels watch your mirrors
YOU1000000001_S0000066	if you can't get the camper exactly where you want unhook the truck and re-situate the truck and the next time you'll be right on the site right where you want it
YOU1000000001_S0000067	so thanks again for watching pete's r v t v with randy today
YOU1000000001_S0000068	new segment here for you hopefully this will help with make your camping a little bit easier check out our other videos check out our youtube channel as well as our facebook page we've always got a great information on there as well
YOU1000000001_S0000069	so thanks again for watching pete's r v and happy camping
YOU1000000003_S0000001	this is a three it's sloppily written and rendered at an extremely low resolution of twenty-eight by twenty-eight pixels
YOU1000000003_S0000002	but your brain has no trouble recognizing it as a three
YOU1000000003_S0000003	and i want you to take a moment to appreciate how crazy it is that brains can do this so effortlessly
YOU1000000003_S0000004	i mean this this and this are also recognizable as threes
YOU1000000003_S0000005	even though the specific values of each pixel is very different from one image to the next
YOU1000000003_S0000006	the particular light sensitive cells in your eye that are firing when you see this three are very different from the one's firing when you see this three
YOU1000000003_S0000007	but something in that crazy smart visual cortex of yours resolves these as representing the same idea
YOU1000000003_S0000008	while at the same time recognizing other images as their own distinct ideas
YOU1000000003_S0000009	but if i told you hey sit down and write for me a program that takes in a grid of twenty-eight by twenty-eight pixels like this
YOU1000000003_S0000010	and out put's a single number between zero and ten telling you what it thinks the digit is
YOU1000000003_S0000011	all the task goes from comically trivial to dauntingly difficult
YOU1000000003_S0000012	unless you've been living under a rock i think i hardly need to motivate the relevance and importance of machine learning and neural networks
YOU1000000003_S0000013	to the present and to the future but what i wanna do here is show you what a neural network actually is
YOU1000000003_S0000014	assuming no background and to help visualize what it's doing not as a buzz word but as a piece of math
YOU1000000003_S0000015	my hope is just that you come away feeling like the structure itself is motivated
YOU1000000003_S0000016	and you feel like you know what it means when you read or you hear about a neural network quote unquote learning
YOU1000000003_S0000017	this video is just gonna be devoted to structure component of that and the following one is gonna tackle learning
YOU1000000003_S0000018	what we're gonna do is put together a neural network that can learn to recognize hand written digits
YOU1000000003_S0000020	this is a some what classic example for introducing the topic
YOU1000000003_S0000021	and i'm happy to stick with the status quo here because at the end of the two videos i wanna point you to a couple of good recourses where you can learn more
YOU1000000003_S0000022	and where you can download the code that does this and play with it on you own computer
YOU1000000003_S0000024	there are many many variants of neural networks and in recent years there's been sort of a boom in research toward these variants
YOU1000000003_S0000025	but in these two introductory videos you and i are just gonna look at the simplest plain vanilla form with no added frills
YOU1000000003_S0000026	this is a kind of a necessary pre-requisite for understanding any of the more powerful modern variants
YOU1000000003_S0000027	and trust me it's still has plenty of complexity for us to wrap our minds around
YOU1000000003_S0000028	but even in this simplest form it can learn to recognize handwritten digits
YOU1000000003_S0000029	which is a pretty cool thing for a computer to be able to do
YOU1000000003_S0000031	and at the same time you'll see how it does fall short of a couple hoops that we might have for it
YOU1000000003_S0000033	as the name suggests neural networks are inspired by the brain but lets break that down what are the neurons and in what sense are they linked together
YOU1000000003_S0000034	right now when i say neuron all i want you to think about is a thing that holds a number specifically a number between zero and one its really not more then that
YOU1000000003_S0000036	for example the network starts with a bunch of neurons co-responding to each of the twenty-eight times twenty-eight pixels of the input image
YOU1000000003_S0000037	which is seven hundred eighty-four neurons in total each one of these hold a number that represents the grey scale value of the corresponding pixel
YOU1000000003_S0000038	ranging from zero for black pixels up to one for white pixels this number inside the neuron is called it's activation
YOU1000000003_S0000039	and the image you might have in mind here is that each neuron is lit up when its activation is a high number
YOU1000000003_S0000041	so all of these seven hundred eighty four neurons make up the first layer of our network
YOU1000000003_S0000043	now jumping over to the last layer this has ten neurons each representing one of the digits
YOU1000000003_S0000044	the activation in these neurons again some number that's between zero and one
YOU1000000003_S0000045	represents how much the system thinks that a given image corresponds with the given digit
YOU1000000003_S0000046	there's also a couple of layer in between called the hidden layers which for the time being should just be a giant question mark
YOU1000000003_S0000047	for how on earth this process of recognizing digits is gonna be handled in this network i choose two hidden layers each one with sixteen neurons
YOU1000000003_S0000048	and admittedly that's kind of an arbitrary choice to be honest i choose two layers based on how i wanna motivate the structure in just a moment
YOU1000000003_S0000049	and sixteen well that was just a nice number to fit on the screen in practice there is a lot of room for experiment with this specific structure here
YOU1000000003_S0000050	the way the network operates activations in one layer determine the activations of the next layer
YOU1000000003_S0000051	and of course the heart of the network as an information processing mechanism comes down to exactly how those activations from one layer bring about activations in the next layer
YOU1000000003_S0000052	it's meant to be loosely analogous to have an biological networks of neurons some groups of neurons firing cause certain others to fire
YOU1000000003_S0000053	now the network i'm showing here has already been trained to recognize digits and let me show you what i mean by that
YOU1000000003_S0000054	it means if you feed in an image lighting up all seven hundred eighty-four neurons of the input layer according to the brightness of the each pixel in the image
YOU1000000003_S0000055	that pattern of activations causes some very specific pattern in next layer which causes some pattern in the one after it
YOU1000000003_S0000056	which finally give some pattern in the output layer and the brightest neuron of that output layer is the network's choice so to speak for what digit this image represents
YOU1000000003_S0000058	and before jumping into the math for how one layer influences the next or how training works
YOU1000000003_S0000059	let's just talk about why it's even reasonable to expect a layered structure like this to behave intelligently
YOU1000000003_S0000060	what are we expecting here what is the best hope for what those middle layers might be doing
YOU1000000003_S0000061	well when you or i recognize digits we piece together various components a nine has a loop up top and a line on the ray
YOU1000000003_S0000062	and eight also has a loop up top but its paired with another loop download
YOU1000000003_S0000063	a four basically breaks down into three specific lines and things like that
YOU1000000003_S0000064	now in a perfect world we might hope that each neuron in the second to last layer corresponds with one of these sub components
YOU1000000003_S0000065	that any time you feed in an image with say a loop up top like a nine or an eight there is some specific neuron whose activation is gonna be close to one
YOU1000000003_S0000066	and i don't mean this specific loop of pixels the hope would be that any generally loopy pattern towards the top sets off this neuron
YOU1000000003_S0000067	that way going from the third layer to the last one just requires learning which combination of sub-components corresponds to which digits
YOU1000000003_S0000068	of course that just kicks the problem down the road because how would you recognize these sub components who even learn what the right sub components should be
YOU1000000003_S0000069	and i still haven't even talked about how one layer influences the next but run with me on this one for a moment recognizing a loop can also break down into sub problems
YOU1000000003_S0000070	one reasonable way to do this would be the first recognize the various little edges that make it up
YOU1000000003_S0000071	similarly a long line like the kind you might seeing the digit one or four or seven well that's really a long edge or may be you think if it a certain pattern of several smaller edges
YOU1000000003_S0000072	so maybe our hope is that each neuron in the second layer of the network corresponds with the various relevant little edges
YOU1000000003_S0000073	maybe when an image like this one comes in it lights up all of the neurons associated with the around eight to ten specific little edges
YOU1000000003_S0000074	which in turn lights up the neurons associated with the upper loop and a long vertical line and those light up the neuron associated within nine
YOU1000000003_S0000075	whether or not this is what our final network actually does is another question when that i'll come back to once we see how to train the network
YOU1000000003_S0000076	but this is a hope that we might have a sort of goal with the layered structure like this
YOU1000000003_S0000077	more over you can imagine how being able to detect edges and patterns like this would be really useful for other image recognition tasks
YOU1000000003_S0000078	and even beyond image recognition there are all sort of intelligent things you might wanna do that breaks down into layers of abstraction
YOU1000000003_S0000079	parsing speech for example involves taking raw audio in picking out distinct sounds which combine to make certain syllables
YOU1000000003_S0000080	which combine to form words which combine to make up phrases and more abstracts dots et cetera
YOU1000000003_S0000081	but getting back to how any of this actually works picture yourself right now designing how exactly the activations in one layer might determine the activations in the next
YOU1000000003_S0000082	the goal is to have some mechanism that could conceivably combine pixels into edges or edges into patterns or patterns into digits
YOU1000000003_S0000083	and to zoom in on one very specific example but say the hope is for one particular neuron in the second layer
YOU1000000003_S0000084	to pickup on whether or not the image has an edge in this region here
YOU1000000003_S0000085	the question at hand is what parameters should the network have what dials and knobs should you be able to tweak
YOU1000000003_S0000086	so that it's expressive enough to potentially capture this pattern or any other pixel pattern or the pattern that several edges can make a loop and other such things
YOU1000000003_S0000087	what will we do is assign a weight to each one of the connections between our neuron and the neurons from the first layer
YOU1000000003_S0000088	these weights are just numbers then take all those activations from the first layer and compute their weighted sum according to these weights
YOU1000000003_S0000090	i find it helpful to think of these weights is being organized into a little grid of their own and i'm gonna use green pixels to indicate positive weights and red pixels to indicate negative weights
YOU1000000003_S0000091	where the brightness of that pixel is some loose depiction of the weight's value
YOU1000000003_S0000092	now if we made the weights associate with almost all of the pixels zero excepts for some positive weights in this region that we care about
YOU1000000003_S0000093	then taking the weighted sum of all the pixel values really just amounts to adding up the values of the pixel just in the region that we care about
YOU1000000003_S0000095	and if you really wanted to pickup on whether there's an edge here what you might do is have some negative weights associated with the surrounding pixels
YOU1000000003_S0000096	then the sum is largest when those middle pixels are bright but the surrounding pixels are darker
YOU1000000003_S0000098	when you compute a weighted sum like this you might come out with any number but for this network what we want is activations is to be some value between zero and one
YOU1000000003_S0000099	so a come thing to do is to pump this weight at sum in to some function that squishes the real number line into the range between zero and one
YOU1000000003_S0000100	and a common function that does this is called the sigmoid function also known as the logistic curve
YOU1000000003_S0000101	basically very negative inputs end up close to zero very positive inputs end up close to one and it just steadily increases around the input zero
YOU1000000003_S0000103	so the activation of the neuron here is basically in measure of how positive the relevant weighted sum is
YOU1000000003_S0000105	but maybe it's not that you want the neuron to light up when the weight at sum is bigger then zero maybe you only want it to be active when the sum is bigger then say ten
YOU1000000003_S0000106	that is you want some bias for it to be inactive
YOU1000000003_S0000107	what we do then is just add in some other number like negative ten to this weight at sum before plugging at through the sigmoid squishification function
YOU1000000003_S0000108	that additional number is called the bias
YOU1000000003_S0000109	so the weights tell you what pixel pattern this neuron in the second layer is picking up on and the bias tells you how high the weighted sum needs to be
YOU1000000003_S0000110	before the neuron starts getting meaningfully active
YOU1000000003_S0000111	and that is just one neuron every other neuron in this layer is gonna be connected to all seven hundred eighty four pixel neurons from the first layer
YOU1000000003_S0000112	and each one of those seven hundred eighty four connections has it's own weight associated with it
YOU1000000003_S0000113	also each one has sum bias some other number that you add on to the weighted sum before squishing it with the sigmoid
YOU1000000003_S0000114	and that's a lot to think about
YOU1000000003_S0000115	with this hidden layer of sixteen neurons that's a total of seven hundred eighty four times sixteen weights along with sixteen biases
YOU1000000003_S0000116	and all of that is just a connections from the first layer to the second the connections between the other layers also have a bunch of weights and biases associated with them
YOU1000000003_S0000117	all said and done this network has almost exactly thirteen thousand total weights and biases
YOU1000000003_S0000118	thirteen thousand knobs and dials they can be tweaked and turn to make this network behave in different ways
YOU1000000003_S0000120	so when we talk about learning what that's referring to is getting the computer to find a valid setting for all of these many many numbers so that it will actually solve the problem in hand
YOU1000000003_S0000122	one thought experiment that is a one's fun and kind a horrifying is to image sitting down and setting all of these weights and biases by hand
YOU1000000003_S0000123	purposely tweaking the numbers so that the second layer picks up on edges the third layer picks up on patterns et cetera
YOU1000000003_S0000124	i personally find this satisfying rather then just treating the network as a total black box
YOU1000000003_S0000125	because when the network doesn't perform the way you anticipate
YOU1000000003_S0000126	if you built up a little bit of relationship with what those weights and biases actually mean you have a starting place for experimenting with how to change the structure to improve
YOU1000000003_S0000127	or when the network does work but not for the reasons you might expect digging into what the weights and biases are doing is a good way to challenge your assumption
YOU1000000003_S0000128	and really expose the full space of possible solutions
YOU1000000003_S0000129	by the way the actual function here is a little come per sum to write down don't you think
YOU1000000003_S0000131	so let me show you an more notationally compact way that these connections are represented this is how you'd see if you choose to read at more about neural networks
YOU1000000003_S0000132	organize all of the activations from one layer into a column as a vector
YOU1000000003_S0000134	then organize all of the weights as a matrix where each row of that matrix corresponds to the connection between one layer and a particular neuron in the next layer
YOU1000000003_S0000135	what that means is that taking the weight at sum of the activations in the first layer according to these weights
YOU1000000003_S0000136	corresponds to one of the terms in the matrix vector product of everything we have on the left here
YOU1000000003_S0000138	by the way so much of machine learning just comes down to having a good grasp of linear algebra
YOU1000000003_S0000139	so for any of you who want a nice visual understanding from matrixes and what matrix vector multiplication means take a look at the series i did on linear algebra especially chapter three
YOU1000000003_S0000140	back to our expression instead of talking about adding the bias to each one of these values independently
YOU1000000003_S0000141	we represent it by organizing all those biases into a vector and adding the entire vector to the previous matrix vector product
YOU1000000003_S0000142	then as a final step i wrap a sigmoid around the outside here
YOU1000000003_S0000143	and what that suppose to represent is that you are gonna apply the sigmoid function to each specific component of the resulting vector inside
YOU1000000003_S0000144	so once you write down this weight matrix and these vectors as their own symbols you can communicate the full transition of activations for one layer to the next
YOU1000000003_S0000145	and in an extremely tight and neat little expression
YOU1000000003_S0000146	and this makes the relevant code both a lot simpler and a lot faster since many libraries optimize the hack out of matrix multiplication
YOU1000000003_S0000148	remember how earlier i said these neurons are simply things that hold numbers well of course the specific numbers that they hold depends on the image you feed in
YOU1000000003_S0000150	so it's actually more accurate to think of each neuron as a function when it takes in the outputs of all neurons in the previous layer and spits out a number between zero and one
YOU1000000003_S0000151	really the entire network is just a function when they takes in seven hundred eighty-four numbers as an input and spits out ten numbers as an output
YOU1000000003_S0000152	it's an absurdly complicated function one that involves thirteen thousand perimeters in the forms of these weights and biases that pick up on certain patterns
YOU1000000003_S0000153	and which involves iterating many matrix vector products and the sigmoid's squishification function
YOU1000000003_S0000154	but it's just the function nonetheless and in a way it's kind of reassuring that it looks complicated
YOU1000000003_S0000155	i mean if it were any simpler what hope would we have that it can take on the challenge of recognizing digits and how does it take on that challenge
YOU1000000003_S0000156	how does this network learn the appropriate weights and biases just by looking at data oh that's what i'll show in the next video
YOU1000000003_S0000157	and i'll also dig a little more in to what this particular network we are seeing is really doing
YOU1000000003_S0000159	now is the point i suppose i should say subscribe to stay notified about when that video or any new videos come out
YOU1000000003_S0000160	but realistically most of you don't actually receive notifications from youtube do you
YOU1000000003_S0000161	may be more honestly i should say subscribe so that the neural networks that underlie youtube's recommendation algorithm
YOU1000000003_S0000162	are primed to believe that you want to see content from this channel get recommended to you any way stay posted for more
YOU1000000003_S0000163	thank you very much to everyone supporting these videos on patron
YOU1000000003_S0000164	i've been a little slow to progress in the probability series this summer but i'm jumping back into it after this project so patron's you can look out for updates there
YOU1000000003_S0000166	to close things off here i have with me lisha lee who did her phd work on the theoretical side of deep learning
YOU1000000003_S0000167	and who currently works at venture capital firm called amplify partners who kindly provided some of the funding for this video
YOU1000000003_S0000168	so lisha one thing i think we should quickly bring up is this sigmoid function
YOU1000000003_S0000169	as i understand it early network use this to squish the relevant weight at sum into that interval between zero and one
YOU1000000003_S0000170	you know kinda motivated by the biological analogy of neurons either being inactive or active
YOU1000000003_S0000171	exactly
YOU1000000003_S0000172	but relatively few modern networks actually use sigmoid anymore that's kind of old school right
YOU1000000003_S0000173	yeah or rather value seems be much easier to train
YOU1000000003_S0000174	and relu relu stands for rectified linear unit
YOU1000000003_S0000175	yes it's it's kind of function we use to taking a max and zero
YOU1000000003_S0000176	and a or a is given by what you're explaining in the video
YOU1000000003_S0000177	and what this was sort of motivated from i think was a partially by a biological analogy with how neurons would either be activated
YOU1000000003_S0000178	or not and so if it passes the certain thresholds it would be the ingenuity function but if it did not then it would just not be activated so be it zero so it's kind of a simplification
YOU1000000003_S0000179	using sigmoids didn't help training or it was very difficult to train at at some point and people just tried value
YOU1000000003_S0000180	and it happen to work very well for these incredibly um deep ah neural networks
YOU1000000003_S0000181	alright thank you lisha

YOU1000000005_S0000002	you've been looking and thinking okay that e-mail campaign that i did i can see that it was opened at this rate
YOU1000000005_S0000003	and i can see even which users opened them and i can even see how many clicked on something
YOU1000000005_S0000004	but how do i know which one of those actually drew in the cell at the end of the day right
YOU1000000005_S0000005	how do we follow the buyer's journey all the way through our website and know which facebook campaign actually converted better how are you tracking those things
YOU1000000005_S0000006	well there's actually a free tool that you can use to do it i'm gonna show you how to do it all right now
YOU1000000005_S0000008	hey you guys this is brought to you by liquid web the most helpful humans in hosting if you need help with your wordpress website would you please reach out to them

YOU1000000005_S0000011	alright let's get to the tutorial it's time to learn about u t m codes so if you've ever seen a u r l path that looks like this
YOU1000000005_S0000012	this has u t m tracking inside of it
YOU1000000005_S0000013	u t m is urgent tracking module you've also probably heard it called tracking parameters or tracking tags
YOU1000000005_S0000014	these u t m tags allow us to track five different things i'm gonna walk you through those look like
YOU1000000005_S0000015	but lets break down this u r l first so you kind of understand what you're looking at
YOU1000000005_S0000016	obviously this right here is the route domain name or the page that you want this link to go to
YOU1000000005_S0000017	then you've got a u t m source living inside of here this is the first perimeter that we're using
YOU1000000005_S0000018	we're asking for the source of this particular link traffic right
YOU1000000005_S0000019	where did my traffic come from where's the source of this traffic where were we using this link
YOU1000000005_S0000020	this says news letter you can track all sorts of stuff here's another u t m perimeter saying the u t m medium is the e-mail
YOU1000000005_S0000021	the u t m campaign is the s e o tips and the u t m content is the call to action button you've got five different perimeters that you can track
YOU1000000005_S0000022	those five different perimeters are campaign source campaign medium campaign name campaign term
YOU1000000005_S0000023	and campaign content now this particular resource that i'm giving you is actually the free recourse that helps you build those u r ls
YOU1000000005_S0000024	easily and quickly they type it all in for you and make it certain that you don't miss any characters whatsoever all you have to do is answer the questions and kind of fill in the blanks here
YOU1000000005_S0000025	and it'll start to build it for you so let me walk you through first of all what they are and then i'll build a sample u r l it's like campaign source
YOU1000000005_S0000026	this is required if we're gonna use any u t m's this is the base one that would be required the medium is required and the campaign name
YOU1000000005_S0000027	and in the term and the content would be optional but the campaign source ah is used to identify the search engine
YOU1000000005_S0000028	news letter name or other source example google right so we're gonna do an example up here using facebook the campaign medium
YOU1000000005_S0000029	this is the u t m medium uses to identify the e-mail or maybe the cost per click
YOU1000000005_S0000030	whatever medium is being used inside of that source so for us it's just gonna be a regular post that we're going to do right
YOU1000000005_S0000031	and then this is also the one that's required the u t m campaign this is used to identify a specific product or promotion or strategic campaign
YOU1000000005_S0000032	so the example that they're giving here is spring cell so you can use something if you're running a certain campaign for donations
YOU1000000005_S0000033	or for a particular product that you wanna highlight
YOU1000000005_S0000034	the campaign term would be to note a key word for this ad so if you're trying to go after a specific key term you can add that inside of there
YOU1000000005_S0000035	and then the campaign content i think this one is really key to use as well
YOU1000000005_S0000036	because this one allows you to differentiate between ads or links if they're in the same type of document
YOU1000000005_S0000037	so for like an e-mail campaign if you have different links
YOU1000000005_S0000038	you can track the specific link inside that document ah that brought you the most traffic so it's a really cool tool here
YOU1000000005_S0000039	let's go up here and build one out and i'll show you how to use it so website u r l this is the link that you want them to land on so if you have an internal landing page
YOU1000000005_S0000040	this can go anywhere to a active link online the campaign source for us right now i'm gonna go ahead and use facebook
YOU1000000005_S0000042	the campaign medium so this is cost per click banner e-mail you can put whatever you want to inside of there i'm actually going to list the facebook page
YOU1000000005_S0000043	i'm gonna put this on so i can track whichever page this is coming from so i'm gonna say this is coming from ash corey page
YOU1000000005_S0000045	and the campaign name remember these are the required three fields that you have to have after your u r l
YOU1000000005_S0000046	so we've got to fill it out and put something in there that makes sense for us is this a product is this a promo code is there a slogan
YOU1000000005_S0000047	what do we need to put in here to help us again better understand where this traffic is coming from i'm gonna put on here s e o tips
YOU1000000005_S0000049	and then you can add in key words and you can add in campaign content if you wanna differentiate those ads
YOU1000000005_S0000050	and for this one i am gonna go ahead and say that this one was an organic ad that basically i didn't promote
YOU1000000005_S0000051	this is just an organic ad that i was ah just gonna post on my facebook page that's it you guys it has built out the link for me
YOU1000000005_S0000052	now here's the cool part we can take that link and use it like a regular link anywhere you want anywhere
YOU1000000005_S0000053	on any social network inside of twitter whatever we want it if we need to have a shorter link you can do that
YOU1000000005_S0000054	and you do have to have authorization required so basically you just need to log in create an account
YOU1000000005_S0000055	but for free we can grab this link right here and we're off and running we can put that behind a text link behind an image
YOU1000000005_S0000056	ah we can put it in a post it doesn't matter we can use it anywhere we want and it allows us to completely track where that traffic came from
YOU1000000005_S0000057	so let's take that link and jump into our facebook here i am inside of my facebook page for corey ash
YOU1000000005_S0000058	and you can come down here and just like you would and adding in any other regular link you'd be adding it here
YOU1000000005_S0000059	and these say something like check out my tool box for really great s e o tools
YOU1000000005_S0000060	and tips and i'm pasting in that u r l
YOU1000000005_S0000062	yes it looks lengthy and that's fine people are still gonna click on it it's no big deal but look it's gonna render it just like it normally would it brought over everything brought over my image brought over the snip it
YOU1000000005_S0000063	and it's going to work perfectly lets go ahead and scroll down here and click post

YOU1000000010_S0000004	how many times have you received a notification that someone that you're following is live only to join that live session
YOU1000000010_S0000005	and what they're doing is sharing out the live stream to other social media platforms so sharing it to their facebook group or to a page or to any other social media
YOU1000000010_S0000006	the time to capture your audience when you're running a live stream is immediately
YOU1000000010_S0000007	you don't wanna have to make your audience wait just wait a minute while i share this out to my page to my group to to my twitter account you need to capture your audience straightaway
YOU1000000010_S0000008	well now there is a way to automate this process so that you're not losing those precious first seconds from your true fans that jump on immediately when you're live
YOU1000000010_S0000009	in this video i'm gonna show you the tool you need to do it and take you through step by step how you can set it up for maximum results across multiple platforms
YOU1000000010_S0000010	and stick around to the end cause i'm also gonna share with you another tool that we use to help notify our subscribers long before our live streams even start
YOU1000000010_S0000011	okay so now onto this amazing facebook live automation tool it was actually introduced to me by a good friend of mine jason everett so make sure you check him out at jason everett dot com
YOU1000000010_S0000012	but the tool is called live leap and again all the links to everything that we're talking about here you can find linked in the description below
YOU1000000010_S0000013	live leap is an awesome service that syndicates out your facebook lives the moment that you go live
YOU1000000010_S0000014	to places like facebook groups facebook pages to twitter to linkedin accounts out through email and s m s as well
YOU1000000010_S0000015	so in order for you to reach all of these different areas or different audiences without live leap it would take you a long time once you went live
YOU1000000010_S0000016	so to automate this whole process is just amazing so this is a real game changer when it comes to facebook live as far as i'm concerned
YOU1000000010_S0000017	there is no other way to automatically syndicate your facebook live out across all of these different platforms but even internally just in facebook
YOU1000000010_S0000018	to share it out automatically to a facebook group a page or multiple groups or multiple pages the instant you go live is really really powerful
YOU1000000010_S0000019	so to set this up you will need to create an account and they do have a one dollar seven day trial period
YOU1000000010_S0000020	so you can try it for seven days for one dollar and again check out the links in the description below so once you've created your live leap account you'll need to sign in using your facebook account
YOU1000000010_S0000021	once you're in this is what you're presented with this is the live leap dashboard
YOU1000000010_S0000022	now on the left hand side here is the main menu so if we click on live broadcast that'll show you all your previous broadcasts that you've syndicated out using live leap
YOU1000000010_S0000023	but the next one down facebook route manager is where the magic happens and this is where you can set up routes or where you want your facebook lives to be syndicated out to
YOU1000000010_S0000024	so we'll create a new rule here a new route so this page is the first step here in this five-step setup process
YOU1000000010_S0000025	and this is where we set up share broadcasts from these pages so we'll give it a name share justin live
YOU1000000010_S0000027	do you wanna share the live videos that you publish from your personal profile
YOU1000000010_S0000029	yes which facebook pages would you like to share your live videos from
YOU1000000010_S0000030	now if you only wanna share your live videos out and syndicate them from your personal profile then that's all you'll need to pick
YOU1000000010_S0000031	if you wanna syndicate out when you go live to a page that you're an admin on or a manager on as well then you can pick those pages here
YOU1000000010_S0000032	so will syndicate out our live streams from our primal video facebook page as well so i'll select that one and choose next
YOU1000000010_S0000034	now share to these pages and groups where do we want these to go do you want to share live videos to your personal profile
YOU1000000010_S0000035	so if we turn this on even though we already had our personal profile ticked on the page before
YOU1000000010_S0000036	this means that if we go live on either our personal profile or the page that will be syndicated to the other as well and likewise
YOU1000000010_S0000037	what pages would we like to syndicate our facebook live to
YOU1000000010_S0000039	justin brown primal video we'll send it there as well when we go live so that way if we're live on our personal profile it's gonna go to the page if we're live on the page it's gonna go to the profile
YOU1000000010_S0000040	so you can already see the level of control you get over this syndication you can pick multiple pages if you need to to really share your live streams out
YOU1000000010_S0000041	and here you can also choose which groups you want to share your live videos to
YOU1000000010_S0000042	so if you're an admin on a group or a group owner then you'll have the choice to pick your groups down the bottom here
YOU1000000010_S0000043	we go next next up we can select the networks outside of facebook that we wanna broadcast and syndicate our facebook lives to
YOU1000000010_S0000044	so you can see we've got twitter and linkedin here and you need to connect your account first by clicking the click here to connect your account on both twitter and linkedin if you want
YOU1000000010_S0000045	you can see i've already got ah my twitter linked up justin brown p v if i wanna broadcast to there then i'll enable that here
YOU1000000010_S0000046	and exactly the same for linkedin you'll have to connect your account if you wanna broadcast to linkedin as well then hit next
YOU1000000010_S0000047	now this is where it gets really interesting and something that you don't see too often you can actually share your facebook live broadcast out via s m s
YOU1000000010_S0000048	so you can upload a c s v file with your s m s contacts or an email list
YOU1000000010_S0000049	so you can upload your email address list into this area as well and if we just click on that now you can see that it's looking for a c s v file
YOU1000000010_S0000051	so we'll skip that one for now and the last integrations you get here you can send live notifications to websites and multiple websites
YOU1000000010_S0000052	so we can click here and add a website you'll go through name your website give all your links you can set what the notification's going to look like
YOU1000000010_S0000053	then you paste this code into your website so whenever you're live there's a notification that pops up on your website
YOU1000000010_S0000054	saying that you're live as well so that is really powerful so you can see here that i've got this set up on our primalvideo dot com website so i can enable that here now too
YOU1000000010_S0000055	and the last one here is webhook integration so if you've got any webhooks that are set up for any services or any other platforms that you're running
YOU1000000010_S0000056	then you can set those up in here as well and once you've got all that set up just click finish and that's it it really that simple
YOU1000000010_S0000057	now it's set up so any time i go live on either my personal profile or a facebook page you can see here share from personal profile
YOU1000000010_S0000058	or one facebook page which was the primal video facebook page it's going to share to personal it's gonna share to that facebook primal video page
YOU1000000010_S0000059	it's also gonna share to my twitter and to our primal video website as well
YOU1000000010_S0000060	now you can have multiple pages multiple groups multiple twitter accounts and multiple websites in here as well the only thing you can't have multiples of is personal accounts
YOU1000000010_S0000061	your live leap account is linked here to your personal facebook profile so at this point you can't broadcast to multiple profiles
YOU1000000010_S0000062	but really who has multiple profiles anyway and even more advanced than this is you can create multiple routes you can see we've just got one here
YOU1000000010_S0000063	we can have multiple routes to broadcast different things out to different platforms and different areas so it's really powerful
YOU1000000010_S0000064	the only other settings you've got in here are advanced settings for email and for text and s m s settings as well
YOU1000000010_S0000065	so you can see here you can link it up to your sendgrid account through a sendgrid a p i and that will be how it's sending the e-mails out and more advanced settings for your s m s broadcast as well
YOU1000000010_S0000066	but if you're not worried about s m s or e-mail then you can ignore these altogether the key area that you wanna set up here is the facebook route manager
YOU1000000010_S0000067	now the last thing that you're probably wondering is this sounds amazing how much does it actually cost i know i can get a seven day trial for a dollar but how much does it cost to keep using it
YOU1000000010_S0000068	well there's two plans there's a basic plan at nineteen dollars per month which is going to do what most people would be after and there's a pro plan at forty-nine dollars per month
YOU1000000010_S0000069	the main difference between the two plans is the number of users you can have you've got one user on the basic plan and three users on the pro plan
YOU1000000010_S0000070	you'll have more advanced training on the pro plan as well and it's got alpha access to page builder
YOU1000000010_S0000071	and it says the page builder automatically creates video replay pages and has a variety of features for marketing
YOU1000000010_S0000072	so if you're interested in that then the pro plan is for you if not at least start out with the basic nineteen dollars per month and that would do most things that you're after
YOU1000000010_S0000073	but grab the one dollar seven day trial and see how this works for you
YOU1000000010_S0000074	i can guarantee you you won't be disappointed this is really a game changing service that's going to change the way people create their facebook lives
YOU1000000010_S0000075	so that's how you can set up the automatic syndication of your facebook lives
YOU1000000010_S0000076	to go out to multiple facebook groups multiple facebook pages ah multiple platforms twitter linkedin your website all using live leap
YOU1000000010_S0000077	now the other tool that i mentioned earlier in the video that we use to notify our subscribers our fans our followers
YOU1000000010_S0000078	that we're going to go live before we're actually live is called send calendar
YOU1000000010_S0000079	the best way to to get people in and attending your facebook lives is to give them as much notice as you can and that's what send calendar allows you to do
YOU1000000010_S0000080	it allows you to get your live streams into their calendar so it's their calendar on their phone on their computer
YOU1000000010_S0000081	that's their business calendar that they're using every day to schedule their everyday lives
YOU1000000010_S0000082	if you can get your live streams into there then it's highly likely they'll show up and attend your live stream
YOU1000000010_S0000083	we did do a video on send calendar a little while back and i'll link it up in the cards now so make sure you check it out

YOU1000000015_S0000004	and repurpose from your iphone or ipad unfortunately the process is not as straight forward as it can be but the good news is there are a few options to do it
YOU1000000015_S0000005	to make it a run through the best ones right now now each option does have it's own advantages and disadvantages so stick around to make sure that you're using the best option for you
YOU1000000015_S0000006	so the first option i'm gonna take you through is solely going to use your iphone or your ipad with no need to use a computer or a laptop
YOU1000000015_S0000007	to be able to help in the process okay so first step is to open up facebook and to go and find the videos that you want to download
YOU1000000015_S0000008	so for this i'm just gonna go to our primal video page
YOU1000000015_S0000009	and i'll come across youtube videos find the video that i want to download let's say it's this one here it's not too late to grow on youtube let's press on that
YOU1000000015_S0000010	and i'm gonna need to grab the link for that video so we come down to share as if we're gonna share this out come down to more options and you wanna choose copy
YOU1000000015_S0000011	so that we're copying the link to that video next you come across to the app store and make sure you have firefox installed
YOU1000000015_S0000012	so firefox is an alternative web browser to google chrome or safari but the biggest difference is that firefox will let you download these videos
YOU1000000015_S0000013	from that video link so you can see i've already got it installed so i'm just gonna hit open on this and firefox is totally free and it is safe to download and install and have on your device
YOU1000000015_S0000014	so the next thing i'm wanna do is to open up firefox and head over to one of these two websites
YOU1000000015_S0000015	either f p download dot i o or f p down dot net currently these are the two most popular ones and either one of them is going to give you great result
YOU1000000015_S0000016	my personal preference is f p download dot i o so i'm gonna hit that now and all we need to do is to paste that link that we've just copied into this text field here
YOU1000000015_S0000017	so we press and hold and then hit paste there is our video link that we had copied we press download and we wait a few seconds
YOU1000000015_S0000018	as it is generating our download link please wait and as we scroll down here you can see all the different options we've got for downloading our videos
YOU1000000015_S0000019	we get the choice of whether we want the h d version and s d version or one of the lower quality versions or even a video army so it's normally gonna be the top one you want that's normally the best quality
YOU1000000015_S0000020	and you can see the file size there sixteen point six-nine meg is much higher than a lot of the other one's there so that's the one that we want we just press and hold on that download button
YOU1000000015_S0000022	and then we get the option here to download link so if we press on download link the then get the option here to download the file so we press download now
YOU1000000015_S0000023	it's gonna go through and it's going to download that file okay so you can see that the file has finished downloading now so if we press on downloads so what you wanna do is press on that because its currently not gonna show up
YOU1000000015_S0000024	in our camera roll or in our gallery so we wanna press on that and then we wanna choose save video and that's now gonna save it across into our photos
YOU1000000015_S0000025	so we can come back here to photos and you see that the video is in there now
YOU1000000015_S0000026	so that's option one and you can see how easy it is to download your videos directly into your ipad or into your iphone just using that firefox app
YOU1000000015_S0000027	now this will only work for videos that are public on facebook
YOU1000000015_S0000028	if they are inside of a closed or private group then this option may not work or if the privacy is set to not be public then this isn't going to work either
YOU1000000015_S0000029	now all this method does that you download a decent quality version of video from facebook it's not the best quality that you can get
YOU1000000015_S0000030	in order to get the best quality videos downloaded from facebook you're gonna want to use your mac or your p c and you wanna download the file on there
YOU1000000015_S0000031	and then transfer it across to your iphone or ipad i'm gonna show you this method now now the best tool i found to do this is called parallel's toolbox
YOU1000000015_S0000032	and it's available for both mac and windows does cause nineteen dollars ninety-nine for the year for a subscription to this software but it is so much more
YOU1000000015_S0000033	than just video downloading software so we're bringing it up now you can see other options for do not disturb mode a presentation mode you've got the ability to hide your desktop
YOU1000000015_S0000034	if you're gonna be doing a screen share or a screen recording you can remove all the clada and mess on your desktop to make it look cleaner you've got an airplane mode you've got options in here to clean up your hard drive
YOU1000000015_S0000035	you've got a video converter in here an animated jif or gif maker there's a heap of tools in here and these guys are actively adding new ones
YOU1000000015_S0000036	in here all the time but the one that we're talking about here is the download video tool and this is about pops-up when you open it so what you wanna do first is just check that your settings are set up
YOU1000000015_S0000037	accordingly you can see here you can choose the preferred quality i would recommend that you gonna leave it on max or maximum available but you can also select lower quality versions
YOU1000000015_S0000038	as well if you are downloading a non m p-four video so a video that's in a different file format you can have it
YOU1000000015_S0000039	download and convert into an m p-four all within this app as well so for us we're gonna download without conversion
YOU1000000015_S0000040	those get to specify your download location so here i'm on a mac it's just gonna go to downloads we'll hit done and i'll show you how this works
YOU1000000015_S0000041	so i wanna come across to that same facebook page at facebook page let's pick the same video it's not too late to grow on youtube we'll select that
YOU1000000015_S0000042	let's pause it so it doesn't play now we need to do here is to grab that link again so here we don't need to hit share it's actually at the top here the u r l we can just copy that
YOU1000000015_S0000043	or if you're not seeing that you can right click on any video and choose show video u r l and this is the link here so you wanna select that right click and choose copy
YOU1000000015_S0000044	or press control c or command c to copy that link you don't wanna come back to parallel's toolbox and then all we need to do is hit paste
YOU1000000015_S0000045	and that's going to download that video for us
YOU1000000015_S0000047	you can see here the file size is a little bit larger at seventeen point five mega bites so it is slightly better quality and then you can see that your download is completed down here
YOU1000000015_S0000048	on your computer and downloads or wherever it is that you've set it to save so from there once you've got the file saved on your computer all you need to do is to transfer it
YOU1000000015_S0000049	over to your iphone or ipad we've got a video linked up in the cards showing you three different methods on how you can do it but it really can be as easy as if you're on a mac
YOU1000000015_S0000050	and on an iphone just use airdrop and just send it to your self wirelessly or you could use something like icloud google drive or dropbox
YOU1000000015_S0000051	to easily transfer that file to yourself so that's how easy it is to download your facebook videos onto your iphone or ipad
YOU1000000015_S0000052	now if you're interested in repurposing your video content across to other platforms and even converting some of your videos into a portrait format
YOU1000000015_S0000053	for places like i g t v then check out the video linked on screen now for a full walk through on how to do it plus an overview of all the options available to you
YOU1000000015_S0000054	i'll see you in the next one
YOU1000000019_S0000000	hey guys what's up it's j r cuber and in this video we're gonna be talking about the valk three the first cube since twenty-ten to be named after a speed cuber
YOU1000000019_S0000001	the vision for the valk three has brought about by mats valk who is the former three by three single world record holder and the third place winner of u s nationals this year
YOU1000000019_S0000002	the cube was designed by qiyi mofangge and was approved by mats valk of course the cube is his main but let's see how the cube actually performs and whether it's right for you
YOU1000000019_S0000004	the ball three is on the price here side of things its about twenty dollars and if you opt for the cubical premium version like i did it's gonna be twenty-seven dollars
YOU1000000019_S0000005	the cube in this review will be the premium valk three and i haven't changed the lube at all i've just tighten the tensions a little bit if you wanna see how the premium valk three is prepared the link will be in the description
YOU1000000019_S0000006	if you wanna check that out anyways moving on the valk three measures fifty-five point five millimeters across uh-huh i kinda feel like that was planned a little bit
YOU1000000019_S0000007	but i guess we'll never know for sure the stock stickers are labeled as the qiyi half bright shades but they're pretty much identical to cubesmith half brights
YOU1000000019_S0000008	which if you guys didn't know were the shades that everyone used to use before the cubical stickers became popular so let's talk about turning
YOU1000000019_S0000009	out of the box the valk three reminded me of yuexiao a bit when i opened up the cubes to compare the mechanisms i was actually very surprised to see that they were almost identical seemingly
YOU1000000019_S0000010	even moyu posted some photos of the yuexiao and the valk three next to each other and the mechanisms look pretty much the same
YOU1000000019_S0000011	but qiyi then went on to post some more photos and explained some more of the subtle differences between the two cubes
YOU1000000019_S0000012	and of course feeling a broken a yuexiao and in broken valk three they're pretty much nothing alike the valk three is pretty much entirely smooth there are no bumps or anything along the turn
YOU1000000019_S0000013	it's just completely smooth it's also a very light and very fast very little effort is required to start turn so the cube is best suited for a light accurate turn style
YOU1000000019_S0000014	when turning fast the cube does become a bit clicky and has a very rigid feel in general the cube is easy to control on tight tensions but sometimes i do loose control and overshoot
YOU1000000019_S0000015	causing a lock up although this mostly happens when i'm spamming tps in the last layer so i've had to learn to control my speed to help with overshooting
YOU1000000019_S0000016	and in general i've just had to adjust my turning style quite a bit to do well in this cube since i've been using the aolong v two as my main i would say i've adapted more of a harsher turn style
YOU1000000019_S0000017	as the aolong v two is very forgiving but it's also not super fast so you can turn very rough and you won't lock up basically
YOU1000000019_S0000018	but if you use that turn style with a valk it just locks up completely so i've had to work on adjusting my turn style to be a bit slower a little bit more precise
YOU1000000019_S0000019	but with a bit of practice i've been able to get my times back down to what they usually are and i pretty much stopped getting lock ups the corner cutting on the valk is up to par with any modern speed cube
YOU1000000019_S0000020	although i did notice after tightening the tensions it was much harder to cut past forty-five same with reverse but smaller cuts were just fine
YOU1000000019_S0000021	the cube however just feels a bit more rigid and sturdy than other three by threes which i really like its a very stable puzzle it's just not as forgiving as some other three by threes
YOU1000000019_S0000022	popping and corner twisting of course never happened on this cube those are two things that really don't even need to be talked about in reviews anymore ah because pretty much all cubes have those traits
YOU1000000019_S0000023	overall the performance of the valk three is really really good but there are just a few things that bug me about it um i'm just not a huge fan of first of all the size
YOU1000000019_S0000024	ah fifty-five point five millimeters is just a little too small for me i do prefer fifty-seven millimeter cubes ah mainly because my hands are really big
YOU1000000019_S0000025	and i actually found my fingers getting caught on the layers sometimes especially doing m turns i just noticed that to happen it's not that big of a deal though
YOU1000000019_S0000026	um but it's just something i noticed second is the completely smooth turning i prefer cubes that are little bit more bumpy and a little slower
YOU1000000019_S0000027	the cube just glides so effortlessly it's kinda hard to control sometimes this is another one that i've gotten used to over time and i'm starting to actually enjoy now ah but i still thought i'd bring it up
YOU1000000019_S0000028	finally the squared off corners now i say this in every review i don't really like squared off corners for me they just cause too much catching and i don't really corner twist either way
YOU1000000019_S0000029	so it's not really an advantage for me but this cube in particular i felt has a bigger catching issue
YOU1000000019_S0000030	i'm not sure why but i noticed the corner catching on the center more often than with other squared off corner puzzles i just think that if the corners were rounded off all of the catching problems would pretty much disappear
YOU1000000019_S0000031	once again i've pretty much gotten used to it but i would still prefer if they weren't there overall the valk three is an extremely solid cube
YOU1000000019_S0000032	the performance is really top of the line and my problems with it are really just more minor annoyances the valk has huge potential in my opinion to be one of the best
YOU1000000019_S0000033	if not the best speed cubes you can buy it honestly surprises me that i'm saying that this cube has gotten me some new personal best and it's getting closer and closer to beating my aolong
YOU1000000019_S0000034	i can't say for sure that i'll make it my main as i still do have some mixed feelings about it but i think you should absolutely give this cube a shot if you've been on the fence about it
YOU1000000019_S0000035	and if you can afford it definitely get the premium version it's set up perfectly and i haven't had any problems with it but anyway that's all i've gotta say about the qiyi mofangge valk three

YOU1000000021_S0000006	the story only gets larger from here so it's cut it down to size with a recapitulation
YOU1000000021_S0000007	the game begins with zack fair soldier second class of the group called soldier a private military army owned by the shinra electric power company in the city of midgar
YOU1000000021_S0000008	he completes a training exercise under the mentorship of his friend and commander angeal a first class soldier
YOU1000000021_S0000009	zack has tremendous skills and talent but is unfortunately a little over confident reckless at times as pointed out by his fellow soldier another first class named sephiroth
YOU1000000021_S0000010	zack idolizes sephiroth as a hero and aspires to one day be at his level but he's not ready yet despite this sephiroth only being part of the training simulation
YOU1000000021_S0000011	angeal helps him out reminding him to temper his aspirations with passionate dreams and steadfast honor
YOU1000000021_S0000012	zack hears from a fellow soldier of the mass desertion of troops in soldier and he's soon called in to speak with the director of soldier a man named lazard
YOU1000000021_S0000013	he's briefed about soldier first class genesis who went missing during a mission in wutai an independent country to the west against whom shinra company is personally leveraging its military might
YOU1000000021_S0000014	zack is to pick up the mission in his place as a test for soldier first class per angeal's recommended promotion
YOU1000000021_S0000015	angeal accompanies zack on this mission as they are to bring down the last bastion for wutai and shinra can complete its mission for economic world domination
YOU1000000021_S0000016	zack notes angeal's massive sword the buster sword is rarely used which angeal jokingly admit he's rather stingy with though does end up using it when his friend is in trouble
YOU1000000021_S0000017	during the mission he encounters it free and while he manages to just hold him off he's amazed to be rescued by his idol sephiroth
YOU1000000021_S0000018	investigates some fallen troops that don't belong to wutai its revealed they bear identical faces to genesis the missing soldier
YOU1000000021_S0000019	suddenly angeal goes missing and sephiroth suspects he too has betrayed them and deserted though zack fervently denies it
YOU1000000021_S0000020	after the mission director lazard confirms angeal really is gone for unknown reasons but assigns zack on a new mission
YOU1000000021_S0000021	he's to investigate what happened with two missing agents that went in to check around genesis's hometown
YOU1000000021_S0000022	in addition he assigns tseng other turks shinra's elite operative and espionage unit to cooperate on this mission
YOU1000000021_S0000023	heading to banora village which was also angeal's hometown zack finds and beats a few more genesis clones
YOU1000000021_S0000024	tseng explains this technology was stolen from shinra which allowed genesis to implant his abilities and strength on other soldier members or monsters
YOU1000000021_S0000025	originally it was to clone their best soldiers to makeup for the low numbers they currently have but zack is more keen to know that this infers that soldiers and monsters are fundamentally and biologically the same
YOU1000000021_S0000026	moving on tseng informs zack that angeal and genesis were childhood best friends that grew up together which is why sephiroth thinks they are in cahoots with their desertion
YOU1000000021_S0000027	finding angeal's mother gillian she notes zack is the restless puppy angeal often spoke about and she tells him genesis came by a month ago with an army of minions and proceeded to start killing townsfolk
YOU1000000021_S0000028	she also lets zack know angeal did come by here and left his prized sword behind which she explains represents his family's honor
YOU1000000021_S0000029	it turns out genesis killed his parents and zack makes a plea to be given a chance to talk with angeal and see about convincing him and genesis to come back
YOU1000000021_S0000030	tseng sees now zack's passion is why sephiroth who was originally assigned this mission but refused chose zack to take his place
YOU1000000021_S0000031	he was actually counting on zack to bring back angeal and genesis his only friends in this world they discovered genesis but he beats them back and angeal resurfaces
YOU1000000021_S0000032	zack discovers angeal standing over a dead gillian and is simply confused by the entire situation
YOU1000000021_S0000033	summoning bahamut to distract and settle down a frustrated zack both genesis and angeal choose to turn their back on shinra while asking how long zack himself can stand living on that side
YOU1000000021_S0000034	afterwards genesis reveals they are all monsters quite literally as he unveils a single large black wing proclaiming this means they have no honor dreams anymore he flies off
YOU1000000021_S0000035	refusing to believe that soldier means monster zack is interrupted as shinra launches an air strike to wipe the town of banora off the map ensuring no witnesses to this event
YOU1000000021_S0000036	soon after shinra wins the war with wutai and has every city in the world under its thumb now
YOU1000000021_S0000037	time passes and zack is greeted by sephiroth personally as he is promoted to soldier first class officially though attaining this dream of his seems bittersweet
YOU1000000021_S0000038	however duty calls and he's assigned a new mission after suiting up in his new black uniform he's told a kill command has been issued for angeal genesis and the clone army
YOU1000000021_S0000039	unfortunately zack cannot be trusted due to his relationship to angeal and even sephiroth holds his own thoughts on the issue
YOU1000000021_S0000040	suddenly they're interrupted as the building is under attack and zack works along side turks reno rude and cassini as they take out more genesis clones
YOU1000000021_S0000041	cassini encounters genesis himself but is soon overwhelmed and zack rescues her and weathers his punishing assault in a one on one dual
YOU1000000021_S0000042	as he strikes down genesis he gets a call from sephiroth who's located angeal
YOU1000000021_S0000043	he tells zack to hurry over before the shinra army arrives so they can help their mutual friend escape and zack is happy to help
YOU1000000021_S0000044	however when he arrives and destroys a new monster he's shocked to see a bears angeal's face on it
YOU1000000021_S0000045	as sephiroth talks more with zack he elaborates more how angeal genesis and himself were close friends and even though sephiroth himself was the company's prized war hero genesis himself wanted such prestige as well
YOU1000000021_S0000046	even when they would train in the company's training room sephiroth could hold his own against both angeal and genesis though when genesis got serious not even his friend angeal could calm him down
YOU1000000021_S0000047	even then sephiroth was the better fighter once injuring genesis's pride even more than his blade
YOU1000000021_S0000048	surveying the monster sephiroth deduces the duo are in league with doctor hollander which ties into the story he just told
YOU1000000021_S0000049	at one time the small wound sephiroth dealt wasn't healing for some reason and the doctor treating him was doctor hollander
YOU1000000021_S0000050	he explains that some mako energy infected the wound when it was dealt and angeal would have to be the donor to transfusion
YOU1000000021_S0000051	sephiroth immediately questions why he was immediately rejected as a donor but got no answer
YOU1000000021_S0000052	rather he learned that hollander was conducting an experiment on a soldier type g in which monsters were to be made but one failed experiment actually produced genesis as a result
YOU1000000021_S0000053	however such an existence has proved to have side effects such as his body rapidly degrading and the curious ability to make copies of himself
YOU1000000021_S0000054	hollander himself appears he's surprised to see them but explains only he can stop genesis's degradation after which genesis himself appears and explains hollander won't be captured
YOU1000000021_S0000055	genesis likens their situation to his favorite play loveless and wonders which of the three friends would be the hero to which he still envies sephiroth
YOU1000000021_S0000056	meanwhile zack pursues hollander but angeal himself interjects and shows him he too has become a monster with his own set of wings
YOU1000000021_S0000057	zack refuses to fight against angeal who is frustrated as his reality of being a monster is clashing with his principles and dreams and zack is sent tumbling down
YOU1000000021_S0000058	when he comes to zack is in a church in the slums where he was woken up by aerith a young woman living there he's immediately smitten with aerith asking her out on a date but getting quickly turned down
YOU1000000021_S0000059	he is impressed by the rare sight of flowers in midgar suggesting she sell them and not only liven up midgar with flowers but also make a lot of money on the side
YOU1000000021_S0000060	she still ends up spending the day with zack as at her favorite shop zack insists on getting her her choice of a gift resulting in aerith picking out a large pink hair ribbon
YOU1000000021_S0000061	she loves the gift promising to wear it always though as their not officially a date date continues she questions the normalcy of members of soldiers as rumor goes they receive some sort of special surgery that turns them beyond human
YOU1000000021_S0000062	she admits their lust for battle also makes them a bit frightening and zack chooses this time to confess he's is a soldier
YOU1000000021_S0000063	she is naturally surprised and actually likes his unique eyes to which zack continues to flirt showing off the trademark mako infused eyes of a soldier
YOU1000000021_S0000064	zack gets called back to shinra but succeeded in leaving a good impression on aerith and they agree to see each other again in route back to shinra angeal stops zack again this time more willing to talk
YOU1000000021_S0000065	he asks for zack's help as he's slowly losing his mind and not only wants to keep his honor but also wants zack to help him defeat their enemies that are causing so much suffering
YOU1000000021_S0000066	zack agrees but he's swept away before he can ask further questions he's delivered to sephiroth who's also helping angeal as they fight genesis whom they suspect is being used by hollander to kill another notorious scientist within shinra hojo
YOU1000000021_S0000067	meanwhile hojo sees through the power play when genesis arrives though zack and angeal are soon to arrive as well genesis retreats but not before summoning bahamut fury for zack to deal with
YOU1000000021_S0000069	later zack goes to visit aerith when tseng halts him to call him into a mission to modeoheim and gives zack pause when he says he also knows aerith but won't elaborate
YOU1000000021_S0000070	genesis forces shoot down their helicopter though zack tseng and a couple of common shinra infantryman manage to survive
YOU1000000021_S0000071	they joke that zack is a country boy from the sticks so this harsh terrain won't bother him though it turns out one of the grunts is as well
YOU1000000021_S0000072	zack is from the tiny village of gongaga and this village is from nibelheim who introduces himself as cloud
YOU1000000021_S0000073	as the mission for hollander continues genesis moves to kill him as he's already begun visibly degrading and claims he doesn't need hollander anymore
YOU1000000021_S0000074	zack saves hollander who beats away cloud while trying to restrain him and zack duels once more genesis proving he's a match against the degrading ace who is severely weakened and promises to end the world with his own miserable fate
YOU1000000021_S0000076	on his way out he is met by angeal as well as hollander who explain the g in project g was not for genesis but for gillian who was angeal's mother who apparently took her own life earlier in banora
YOU1000000021_S0000077	the experiment was two fold gillian had jenova cells injected into her while she was pregnant with angeal and genesis simply had jenova cells implanted directly into him as a test tube baby
YOU1000000021_S0000078	what this resulted in was the failure genesis growing up strong but doom to a short lifespan while angeal was perceived and born as a perfect specimen
YOU1000000021_S0000079	reason being angeal can use the jenova cells as a two way conduit as intended angeal then explains his cells can absorb genetic traits and pass them to others beyond what genesis can manage which is only imprint them onto others
YOU1000000021_S0000080	choosing to end his suffering by his own hands angeal casts away hollander and absorbs a variety of monsters he created to help test and strengthen zack
YOU1000000021_S0000081	the resulting abomination slashes zack cleanly on the cheek and he is forced to kill the resulting mess that used to be his friend and mentor
YOU1000000021_S0000082	after winning a bitter victory a degrading angeal is grateful that zack ended him with dignity and honor before dying he passes on his family sword and legacy of honor the buster sword to zack
YOU1000000021_S0000084	even after returning to midgar zack openly mourns to aerith with whom he's developed a much closer relationship and has chosen to retain the scar angeal gave him as a memento
YOU1000000021_S0000085	time passes as zack and his hair style has matured
YOU1000000021_S0000086	he is no longer the young puppy he used to be as now a mentor himself to a new class of soldier rookies
YOU1000000021_S0000087	shinra sends him for some r and r at costa del sol with cissnei watching over him as it turns out director lazard has since gone missing and was secretly using company money to fuel hollander's research
YOU1000000021_S0000088	she teases him about his girlfriend aerith and explains she's under constant turk surveillance as it turns out she is the last living member of a race called the ancient
YOU1000000021_S0000089	zack is surprised not only to learn this but also that aerith never told him
YOU1000000021_S0000090	unexpectedly genesis copies attack them a sea which can only mean genesis is still around too
YOU1000000021_S0000091	tseng isn't so sure and conjectures that since all souls return to the life stream its possible genesis's soul is still able to control his copies from there as well
YOU1000000021_S0000092	and so zack's vacation is over as the three of them are to investigate attack on junon
YOU1000000021_S0000093	it turns out more genesis clones were attacking and this time hollander was even there though he gets away once again
YOU1000000021_S0000094	sephiroth comes by to greet zack and questions if genesis really did die he deliberately drops that even the slums in midgar are being attacked encourages zack to return there and promises they'll meet again
YOU1000000021_S0000095	returning to aerith he finds a monster dog there but its not really causing problems though zack notes its also an angeal copy and it seems keen to protect aerith
YOU1000000021_S0000096	however its weak due to degradation and chooses to rest in the rafters meanwhile zack builds aerith a cart to sell flowers from and has her give him a list of her wishes so he can do his best to make her happy
YOU1000000021_S0000097	unfortunately an urgent mission comes up to separate their time together
YOU1000000021_S0000099	now sephiroth and zack have been dispatched to come in after a monster outbreak near a rural mako reactor that has even killed the soldier operatives there
YOU1000000021_S0000100	interestingly these operatives were tracking the missing lazard and reported a strange pod device similar to hollanders which means lazard hollander and genesis might all be involved here
YOU1000000021_S0000101	as their mission in mentions nothing of their old friends sephiroth privately confesses to zack that he's seriously considering leaving shinra as well depending on what happens in this mission
YOU1000000021_S0000102	before departing zack spends some precious time with aerith though tseng is never far off
YOU1000000021_S0000103	tseng promises to protect aerith as he's always done and zack sincerely thanks him as the only person he can rely on these days
YOU1000000021_S0000104	before the mission cloud turns out to be one of the three dispatched to him and turns out the reactor they must investigate is in cloud's hometown of nibelheim
YOU1000000021_S0000105	as they arrive sephiroth makes small talk asking cloud how it feels to be home again and trying to relate as he has no original town and all he knows is his mother's name to be jenova who died after he was born
YOU1000000021_S0000106	in town they are met by a local town girl by the name of tifa
YOU1000000021_S0000107	when tifa learns he's a soldier first class she seems surprised by the fact they only sent him and sephiroth and begins to ask something else but stops and runs off instead
YOU1000000021_S0000108	as sephiroth moves on to investigate he tells cloud he can visit his family while he's in town and when zack wonders why cloud is hesitating and wearing his helmet and mask he admits its something embarrassingly personal
YOU1000000021_S0000109	he later admits he was exaggerating and telling his friends back home that he was already a soldier first class and is too ashamed to confront that lie now
YOU1000000021_S0000110	meanwhile sephiroth finds this whole area oddly familiar and after they learn tifa is to be their guide to the reactor they pause to have a group photo taken
YOU1000000021_S0000111	as zack sephiroth tifa and a hiding cloud arrive at the reactor cloud is told to wait outside with tifa and keep her safe
YOU1000000021_S0000112	within zack finds it interesting that the chamber to the reactor is also named the same as sephiroth's mother as the war hero sephiroth identifies the cause of the reactor malfunction
YOU1000000021_S0000113	zack appears into one of the pods powering the plant and is shocked to find a monster within
YOU1000000021_S0000114	sephiroth explains that while the average soldier is a mako infused human they are still simply stronger than normal humans
YOU1000000021_S0000115	however this thing has mako levels exponentially higher than even a soldier sephiroth doesn't know what they are beyond that they're abominations created by doctor hojo in his lab
YOU1000000021_S0000116	zack notes sephiroth is well above average himself and asks if there is something more to that and it triggers a splitting headache for sephiroth
YOU1000000021_S0000117	sephiroth comes to a horrifying hypothesis that its possible he was created the same way and it becomes a crisis of identity ironically identical to his friends genesis and angeal
YOU1000000021_S0000118	he admits he always knew he was unlike other children growing up but could never place why and doesn't want to think the reason could be that he's been the same as a monster
YOU1000000021_S0000119	he questions his humanity when suddenly a sneak attack by genesis knocks zack back
YOU1000000021_S0000120	genesis swoops in to inform sephiroth that of the three friends he was the greatest monster to come out of the jenova project possibly due to having hojo instead of hollander managing him
YOU1000000021_S0000121	zack is more focused on the confirmed existence of genesis but he's ignored as genesis continues to push sephiroth with his past
YOU1000000021_S0000122	he explains the jenova projects were all projects involving usage of jenova's cells jenova herself was excavated from two-thousand year old rock layer and is a true monster herself
YOU1000000021_S0000123	sephiroth is shocked again yet genesis continues exposing that jenova project g created successes like angeal and failures like himself
YOU1000000021_S0000124	and jenova project s use the remains of every experiment thus far to create a perfect monster sephiroth himself
YOU1000000021_S0000125	in addition sephiroth cannot copy or diffuse his genes so he cannot degrade
YOU1000000021_S0000126	he makes another plea for sephiroth to share cells with him and sephiroth replies that regardless of anything he just said being true or not he'll do the right thing and let the evil genesis rot
YOU1000000021_S0000127	however zack moves after genesis but halts to save tifa and a beaten cloud from a monster
YOU1000000021_S0000128	afterwards cloud wishes he were strong like zack but zack warns him not to get tangled up with soldier
YOU1000000021_S0000129	the next morning tifa informs zack that sephiroth is in the shinra mansion and zack gets a phone call from aerith ending it with a promise to see her after the mission
YOU1000000021_S0000130	meanwhile sephiroth has found an old archive underneath the mansion and within reads many reports on the jenova project learning information such as jenova was also an ancient like aerith
YOU1000000021_S0000131	after waiting seven days while sephiroth reads nonstop zack comes out to discover nibelheim
YOU1000000021_S0000132	an suddenly on fire with many townsfolk slain even cloud is being once again and around the corner is sephiroth himself calmly standing amidst the flames
YOU1000000021_S0000133	following him back to the reactor zack sees an injured tifa within hatefully cursing both shinra and soldier
YOU1000000021_S0000134	breaking through the door to jenova zack sees sephiroth beyond unusually unsettled and talking strangely about going to the promised land together with his mother
YOU1000000021_S0000135	confronting sephiroth zack is ignored as sephiroth insists his mother the ancient was the superior race and they should have ruled the planet
YOU1000000021_S0000136	somehow humans stole that opportunity for sovereignty and hunted the ancients to near extinction instead
YOU1000000021_S0000137	finally fed up with the crimes of humans and shinra in particular sephiroth sees what angeal and genesis kept warning about and chooses to stand alone
YOU1000000021_S0000138	embracing the fact that he was never human and thus doesn't have to pretend to be anymore disgusted with shinra's sick and twisted past of violating his mother
YOU1000000021_S0000139	and accepting of being of the master race of ancients sephiroth severs all ties to shinra soldier and the human race
YOU1000000021_S0000140	he tears away a mechanical facade to reveal the real jenova who has been savagely mutilated and experimented on by shinra and left to be a monstrous battery within this power plant
YOU1000000021_S0000141	zack still wants answers for the dead towns folk and questions sephiroth's sanity but sephiroth has no more words for any human even they used to be his allies
YOU1000000021_S0000142	feeling betrayed zack attacks sephiroth who parries him easily and knocks him to the depths of the reactor
YOU1000000021_S0000143	as they clash zack remembers when sephiroth was still the ideal hero and role model to him
YOU1000000021_S0000144	once explaining that materia which allows humans to use magic is form from condensed mako energy from the planet and contains knowledge of the ancients who were bound to the planet and have the power to control it at will
YOU1000000021_S0000145	accusing sephiroth of losing his way he is countered by sephiroth who considers himself to be the chosen one despite being engineered by humans to be a paragon ancient to do their bidding
YOU1000000021_S0000146	he intends to carry on what he feels is the right of the ancients and rule this world and take it back the power hungry humans like the shinra corporation
YOU1000000021_S0000147	again they clash with sephiroth clearly controlling the duel forced back the buster sword is knocked from zack's hand as zack no longer has the energy to fight back
YOU1000000021_S0000148	after the exhaustive fight sephiroth is fixated on liberating his mother and doesn't notice cloud coming up behind him with zack's sword and striking him with a sneak attack
YOU1000000021_S0000149	cloud then rushes to tifa's side but sephiroth comes out bearing the head of jenova and upset at cloud's insulting strike
YOU1000000021_S0000150	zack urges cloud to finish off an injured sephiroth but naturally cloud is nowhere near sephiroth's league in terms of strength
YOU1000000021_S0000151	however cloud makes up for it in sheer guts as after sephiroth impales him on his sword and issues a warning not to make him mad cloud instead uses all his strength to lift up sephiroth who's surprised by the feat and hurl him away
YOU1000000021_S0000152	cloud succumbs to his injuries next to zack and as they both pass out doctor hojo arrives on the scene and chooses cloud to be his next test subject
YOU1000000021_S0000154	the next thing he knows a vision of the angeal wakes zack up as he breaks out of his tank fighting disorientation he gets cloud out but cloud is stuck in a comatose state
YOU1000000021_S0000155	after changing cloud into his spare soldier first class uniform zack recalls aerith's last letter for him in which she wants to spend more time together which prompts him to make his next destination back to midgar
YOU1000000021_S0000156	however shinra labels them both fugitive samples so they find themselves now running from the army and cassini actually manages to catch up to them first
YOU1000000021_S0000157	he pleads with her to just walk away as he knows its a tall order to escape the turks but cassini chooses her duty over her personal feelings
YOU1000000021_S0000158	however zack refuses to fight her seriously for now and must leave her behind
YOU1000000021_S0000159	still she follows them and empathizes with cloud's severe case of mako addiction and so helps them this once to escape with her motorcycle
YOU1000000021_S0000160	however genesis isn't done as he interrupts their ride seizing zack and pulling out a bit of his hair
YOU1000000021_S0000161	he knows they are hojo's latest experiments and modified versions of jenova's power runs through both of them
YOU1000000021_S0000162	he asks one of his clones eat his hair sample in order to gain the cells needed to cease his degradation but all it does is mutate the clone into a gruesome monster
YOU1000000021_S0000163	later zack crosses by his hometown of gongaga but cassini is there and warns him the turks already expected him to visit his parents though they are also hunting for angeal in the area who reportedly was sighted in shinra's lab
YOU1000000021_S0000164	she's watching over his family for him and teases that his parents have already asked her to join the family
YOU1000000021_S0000165	zack notes something like angeal was also nearby but flies away again and later he is surprised to find doctor hollander and genesis himself
YOU1000000021_S0000166	it turns out that after the doctor nearly died by the hand of genesis he used his cells to stay alive and despite degrading on borrowed time is looking for a cure for that now
YOU1000000021_S0000167	genesis believes a pure s cell sample will stop their degradation and only cloud and zack bear those right now
YOU1000000021_S0000168	hollander makes a grab for cloud but zack puts and end to the doctor once and for all with a little help from former director lazard
YOU1000000021_S0000169	he's white winged and degrading like angeal with his exact face precisely because he's been turned into an angeal copy by his own doing
YOU1000000021_S0000170	while the real angeal really is dead lazard finds himself with angeal's will to save zack and others which means they must stop genesis once and for all
YOU1000000021_S0000171	almost to midgar zack stops to finally confront the failed and tortured creation of a jenova infused human who considers zack a perfect fusion of angeal's will and sephiroth's superior cells
YOU1000000021_S0000172	behind him is a statue to the goddess minerva as well as a massive materia he claims will return everyone to the life stream
YOU1000000021_S0000173	zack attempts to calm genesis down and try to help him regain his humanity but genesis chooses to uses the materia's power to transform into a massive armored monster
YOU1000000021_S0000174	zack wins over this form reverting genesis to his original form once more who is now cured of his degradation thanks to the materia
YOU1000000021_S0000175	zack sees no reason to fight now but genesis still insists and zack is frustrated that once again he has to shoulder a burden forced upon him
YOU1000000021_S0000176	clashing one final time he knocks genesis back who for an instant turns around and sees the goddess minerva as he always imagined just before falling for good in the life stream signifying his final defeat
YOU1000000021_S0000177	still honorable zack carries a still breathing genesis and lays him to rest beside cloud and an injured lazard
YOU1000000021_S0000178	lazard says the winged angeal copy from before protected cloud from shinra earlier but its too late as the final copies of angeal die and return to the life stream leaving zack as his only living legacy
YOU1000000021_S0000179	the winged dog also had a letter for zack in its possession which zack reads
YOU1000000021_S0000180	it turns out its from aerith and its apparently been four years since their last meeting and this has been eighty-ninth unrequited letter she sent him
YOU1000000021_S0000181	she mentions her flower sales are doing well these days and despite her feelings for him this would be her final letter to him
YOU1000000021_S0000182	naturally zack is upset to learn he's been unconscious for four years but still wants to be with aerith and make things right despite his unintended absence
YOU1000000021_S0000183	carrying cloud he has every intention to get back to midgar save cloud and reunite with aerith
YOU1000000021_S0000184	after leaving genesis to rest genesis is soon snatched away by two mysterious soldiers first class nero and weiss who seek to recruit genesis into their organization of deep ground preceding events to be played out in a future game dirge of cerberus
YOU1000000021_S0000185	meanwhile tseng orders cassini and the other turks to find and save zack before the army finds them which cassini is very motivated to do
YOU1000000021_S0000186	though this is a near-treasonous action tseng is willing to risk it for his friend and for aerith's sake
YOU1000000021_S0000187	at the same time zack and cloud are in the back of a pickup truck just outside midgar and even the turks are having a hard time finding them now
YOU1000000021_S0000188	unfortunately the army intercepts zack first and zack willingly chooses to fight and honorably protect cloud despite his own desire to return to aerith and save himself
YOU1000000021_S0000189	cloud only now begins to wake up out of his mako poisoning as zack walks out to face down literally hundreds upon hundreds of shinra troops and attack helicopters
YOU1000000021_S0000190	commenting that the price of freedom is steep zack gives a final salute and promise to protect his honor as he takes on shinra's military single handedly
YOU1000000021_S0000191	as he stands strong against thousands of blades bullets and missiles zack is pushed to his limit as he recalls the bonds he held precious in life
YOU1000000021_S0000192	starting with his close friends within shinra he fondly recalls his former heroic idol sephiroth and turks cassini and tseng
YOU1000000021_S0000193	then finally his closest bonds those of his friend and mentor angeal inspiring infantryman cloud and his love interest aerith
YOU1000000021_S0000194	against all odds zack triumphs in his final stand but he is on his last legs as shinra begins reinforcing their troops firing countless bullets into a relentless zack
YOU1000000021_S0000195	eventually enough is enough as he cannot overcome his wounds anymore and after some nameless infantry man puts a final bullet into his head
YOU1000000021_S0000196	zack the rising star of soldier first class with dreams of heroism despite being dragged into so many outside messes tragically falls with thoughts of aerith to carry him into his final moments
YOU1000000021_S0000198	as the game concludes aerith notes the sudden rain and seems to sense something wrong
YOU1000000021_S0000199	meanwhile cloud finally wakes up and drags himself over to zack who is still barely alive and forces a smile for him and urges cloud to live on in his stead as his own living legacy
YOU1000000021_S0000200	passing the buster sword onto cloud he also passes on his dream of being a hero for cloud to fulfill
YOU1000000021_S0000201	cloud acknowledges the passing of the torch and zack honorably dies though with a smile on his face
YOU1000000021_S0000202	cloud thanks him promises not to forget and he walks away leaving zack's body behind
YOU1000000021_S0000203	joining the life stream zack is greeted by his friend angeal who finally now is able to rest in peace
YOU1000000021_S0000204	as the game ends the trauma of the events unfortunately result in cloud blocking all memory of zack despite his promise
YOU1000000021_S0000205	his delirium actually has him believing he is zack in all but name as the game leads up to the original installment final fantasy seven
YOU1000000021_S0000206	crisis core final fantasy seven has enjoyed the success of selling over six and a half million copies worldwide
YOU1000000027_S0000001	hi everyone welcome back to lavendaire and happy valentine's day sending you lots of love today i wanna share some self love journaling prompts that you can do today to just cultivate more self love for yourself
YOU1000000027_S0000002	so i'll just get right into it the first is an easy one that's actually in my artist of life workbook is to list ten things that you love about yourself
YOU1000000027_S0000003	so this one's pretty simple i i know it can be hard for some people who have never really thought of themselves like that so if it's hard for you to find things that you love about yourself why don't you start with things that you like like what personality traits that you like about yourself
YOU1000000027_S0000004	or you could ask some friends what they think your best qualities are and then start from there the next journaling prompt is to take some time to sit down and write a love letter to yourself now i know i've shared that one before because i love it so much
YOU1000000027_S0000005	but the fun hook is you can do it on this website called futureme where you send that love letter to yourself for next year's valentine's day you know what i mean
YOU1000000027_S0000006	so as you're writing this love letter and celebrating everything that you are you're going to feel amazing as you're writing it you're gonna feel the love start cultivating for yourself
YOU1000000027_S0000007	but at the same time the fun part is that because you're sending it back to yourself a year later for next year's valentine's day
YOU1000000027_S0000008	then you're gonna get a little surprise in a year and maybe you can do this every year so that you send yourself a love letter every year for valentine's day because duh self love is super important and you can never have too much of it
YOU1000000027_S0000009	alright the next journaling prompt is something that i learned from my friend kajal pandey this past sunday actually we did a live chat together on facebook if you want to watch that full live chat it's really amazing
YOU1000000027_S0000010	i'll link it down below so that you can watch the chat also follow my facebook page because i'm gonna do more live chats and just post more videos on facebook anyway this prompt is to list all the things that you don't exactly like about yourself
YOU1000000027_S0000011	list all those traits that you find yourself either worrying about or complaining about or just anything that doesn't sit well with yourself list those traits and then add but i love myself anyway at the end
YOU1000000027_S0000012	so for example i feel lazy and unmotivated today but i love myself anyway or i don't always feel pretty or confident when i'm in a social setting but i love myself anyway
YOU1000000027_S0000013	or i think that i talk too much but i love myself anyway do you see what we're doing here so you're taking a trait that is kind of seen as negative in your head those traits that you're usually like ugh why am i like this
YOU1000000027_S0000014	or i don't like this part about me basically the traits where you're being judgmental on yourself or hard on yourself because that's what we do all the time and then just listing it out being honest about it
YOU1000000027_S0000015	and then end it with but i love myself anyway so this is a great way to learn to love all that you are the good parts and the bad parts or the strengths and the weaknesses because love is unconditional
YOU1000000027_S0000016	love encompasses all so i know we started out with like the things that you do love about yourself and this is another way to kind of be honest about the things that you don't necessarily like about yourself and yet you love yourself anyway
YOU1000000027_S0000017	because nobody is perfect if you think about the people that you love in your life they're not perfect they have flaws they have times that they make mistakes and yet you love them anyway
YOU1000000027_S0000018	so learn to treat yourself in that way like yes i might not like this characteristic about myself or i might feel this way that doesn't support me but i love myself anyway
YOU1000000027_S0000019	so it's just learning to be unconditional with your love it's so great right so like i said if you want to watch that full video with kajal i'll link that video down below so you could catch up
YOU1000000027_S0000020	next i'm gonna share some journaling prompts that you can actually ask yourself every day in the morning just to get yourself off on the right foot because every day you want to be listening to yourself and doing what serves you best
YOU1000000027_S0000021	so at the beginning of every day you can always ask yourself questions like what am i excited to do today or how can i give myself that extra care today because i'm all about self care guys and lastly what can i do to protect my energy
YOU1000000027_S0000022	and i love that last question i actually have that question in my workbook too because it's like being aware of how you can protect your energy in a way that you're not allowing you know toxic people in your life
YOU1000000027_S0000023	or you're not just saying yes to people just because you're a people-pleaser you know a lot of times for me personally it's hard to say no but in order to protect my energy and my well-being i have to learn to say no more more often
YOU1000000027_S0000024	so that i don't find myself in those awkward situations where i'm doing something that i don't want to be doing but i said yes so i have to do it and it just doesn't feel good you don't want to put yourself in those situations
YOU1000000027_S0000025	but yeah i think that's a pretty good start on journaling prompts that you can do today to cultivate more self love in your life also as you're checking out that live chat video on my facebook just go ahead and like my facebook page while you're at it
YOU1000000027_S0000026	because i'm gonna be doing more live chats here and there and i'm just trying to post more videos on facebook and be more active there

YOU1000000033_S0000013	yeah
YOU1000000033_S0000015	what we're primarily trying to communicate to the world is jesus the holy name of jesus the only name given by which human beings can be saved god the father
YOU1000000033_S0000016	the the the clouds are opening again he's saying to the world this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased listen to him all we're trying to say is listen to him

YOU1000000033_S0000019	post-vatican two there were many upheavals and changes that went on both in the church and outside the church and against the church and for the church and it it was a whirlwind
YOU1000000033_S0000020	and i began to realize that my faith wasn't nearly as strong as i thought it was here i was a religious sister here i was vowed to him and my faith was very very shaken
YOU1000000033_S0000021	and it was shaken because there were just so many theories being thrown at us or things that we had believed or seemed to be in concrete were suddenly up for question and i realized that i wasn't rooted deeply enough
YOU1000000033_S0000022	and i had had a good education i had had religious formation but something hadn't transmitted from here to here
YOU1000000033_S0000023	yeah well like so many people i got caught up in the confusion of our culture moral confusion intellectual confusion and then a friend invited me to make a retreat when i was a senior at the university of notre dame
YOU1000000033_S0000024	i was very skeptical about it i felt like i was a philosophy major and i felt like gee i kind of know about these things and and then i just heard the most amazing story about the catholic faith and how beautiful it was but that wouldn't have been enough
YOU1000000033_S0000025	i really experienced the personal presence of christ on that retreat and i felt like he was addressing me i didn't hear any words but i just knew he was there and i just knew that i had to make a decision about him yeah was he who he said he was or not
YOU1000000033_S0000026	when i was twenty years old nineteen seventy-eight my sister convinced me to go to a conference at the university of notre dame and i always wanted to see notre dame touchdown jesus so i thought i'll go
YOU1000000033_S0000027	thirty-five thousand catholics about two hundred priests and bishops it was a catholic charismatic renewal event
YOU1000000033_S0000028	and the when i got there i realized i was in a very different place than what it looked like every other person in the stadium and everybody seemed to just be so alive and animated in their faith
YOU1000000033_S0000029	i was a pretty nominal catholic at that point i had seen god do some amazing things in my family but essentially that weekend i began to search and hunger
YOU1000000033_S0000030	if he really was the son of god if he really was alive if he really was present i i knew that my search had just come to an end unexpectedly soon and i thought i'd be searching for years and years and years but there he was
YOU1000000033_S0000031	and by the grace and mercy of god i was able to swallow my pride and repent and go to confession and really surrender my life to the lord i have to tell you i'm just profoundly grateful for god's mercy to me and helping me find him when i did
YOU1000000033_S0000032	i don't know where i'd be today without him
YOU1000000033_S0000033	and so i um was inspired to call a good friend of mine who was a carmelite sister and i talked to her and after we talked for fifteen or twenty minutes she said to me
YOU1000000033_S0000035	what are you looking for
YOU1000000033_S0000037	and i said i don't know
YOU1000000033_S0000039	but i wanna give my life to god in a way i never have before and i don't know what that means i've given him my whole life he has my my vows and vowed to him what what more can i give him
YOU1000000033_S0000040	and her response was very wise we were the same age but her response was very wise she said to me then just tell him that
YOU1000000033_S0000042	so i went home and walked into the chapel and said lord i wanna give my life to you in a way i never have before i don't know what that means but you have it whatever that is
YOU1000000033_S0000044	i walked out of the chapel and
YOU1000000033_S0000046	nothing no no bells and whistles as they say today no nothing like that i just walked out of the chapel and started up the stairs i was gonna correct papers
YOU1000000033_S0000047	and um as i was walking up the stairs as i often say if i could go into that convent today i could tell you the exact step where i was
YOU1000000033_S0000048	when it was like somebody took a pitcher of water
YOU1000000033_S0000050	and poured it over my head
YOU1000000033_S0000052	and
YOU1000000033_S0000054	and that's the that was the only way i could describe the experience
YOU1000000033_S0000056	but i was not afraid
YOU1000000033_S0000058	and i was cynical i was still pretty cynical and i so i took a few more steps up and i said god is this you
YOU1000000033_S0000060	what is this
YOU1000000033_S0000062	and he said it is my holy spirit
YOU1000000033_S0000064	how did i hear no audible voice just a thought goes through your head that you know is not your own
YOU1000000033_S0000066	he said this is my holy spirit and the joy that came into my life in that moment has never gone
YOU1000000033_S0000068	well you know when i when i first turned my life over to the lord when i was a senior at notre dame i i didn't have any plans to go into ministry
YOU1000000033_S0000069	i just knew i had met god and that was the most important thing in my life so i went off to grad school to princeton and then i took a leave from grad school to begin working for the cursillo movement
YOU1000000033_S0000070	and then i ah got involved in the charismatic renewal movement and then cardinal suenens asked me to move to belgium so it isn't like i had a plan
YOU1000000033_S0000071	i'm trying not to put any limits on the lord i'm trying not to have any presuppositions i'm trying to each day get up and do what seems to be the most pleasing thing to him
YOU1000000033_S0000072	so then the last the closing of the event was a big liturgy in the football stadium and i was begging the lord in my heart
YOU1000000033_S0000073	please help me give me the faith give me the love give me something because i don't have the strength to resist sin essentially and to really live for you wholeheartedly
YOU1000000033_S0000074	and i went to communion came back from communion i was standing in my place and they ah this guy comes up to me and he's got his name tag on he is from indianapolis a guy maybe in his mid forties at the time i was twenty
YOU1000000033_S0000075	and he said to me he said son he looked at my nametag and he said peter do you mind if i share something with you and i said sure he said i'm back here about six rows and i was going to communion and i saw you and my eyes fell on you
YOU1000000033_S0000076	and i felt the holy spirit touch my heart and say you go tell that young man that the faith and love that he is seeking shall be granted to him because christ loves him and has died for him
YOU1000000033_S0000077	as soon as he said that it was like a bomb went off
YOU1000000033_S0000079	the grace of god touch me in a new way and i put my arms around the guy and we stood there and i just squeezed him and i cried like a baby on his shoulder i felt
YOU1000000033_S0000080	i felt in my spirit and i think that's the day i experienced the calling for what i'm doing right now and as this guy is holding me i'm just experiencing a tremendous sense of the love of god pouring into me
YOU1000000033_S0000081	and the lordship and the majesty of jesus christ that he is the lord all power and authority belongs to him and he said my son i'm calling you trust me
YOU1000000033_S0000082	and then he said i looked around to see my people were getting touched everywhere like that and i felt in my heart like the holy spirit was saying welcome the reign of god is at hand you're part of the kingdom the kingdom is alive because the king is alive and i went home my whole life changed after that
YOU1000000033_S0000084	well i began with renewal ministries back in actually i i knew ralph for quite a number of years and we spoke at some conferences together and certainly had somewhat of a common mind
YOU1000000033_S0000085	and then peter came into the picture as well and the three of us just at different times collaborating at at a conference somewhere we began to see that we all had a kind of similar message
YOU1000000033_S0000086	i saw ralph martin on that conference for the first time ever he was a speaker in nineteen seventy-eight
YOU1000000033_S0000087	there was a lot of speakers but when he spoke ah that saturday afternoon he spoke like like the prophet elijah for some reason it went right through me like a sword and and brought tremendous conviction to me
YOU1000000033_S0000088	that's partly what i was praying for was that kind of conviction and that carried through for me as i left that place i bought every tape every every book i could find of his and i read it and i got other guys to do it with me
YOU1000000033_S0000089	and we would literally we would spend friday nights some friday nights doing in college believe it or not and we would listen to these talks and it would really burn in us and we get on our knees we get on our face in the carpet and we say lord jesus what you put in him put in us
YOU1000000033_S0000090	and it did that
YOU1000000033_S0000091	well we all had a really strong encounter with the lord in different ways through the catholic charismatic renewal and we all ended up here in ann arbor michigan as part of a a covenant community and we we knew each other there
YOU1000000033_S0000092	but then at a certain point in nineteen eighty-nine things were kind of happening and changing around us
YOU1000000033_S0000093	so we found ourselves drawn together and we felt like the lord was calling us to meet every week for an extended period of prayer and just really asking the lord what he wanted for us and from that came a much closer collaboration
YOU1000000033_S0000094	how it all began i don't know if ralph mentioned this but kind of how it all began was he and i went to ah hear a talk in detroit at a large conference we came to hear one speaker at this larger conference
YOU1000000033_S0000096	and we heard this speaker he was good we were getting ready to leave the guy who was emceeing the event ah was making announcements just before lunch he made all his announcements and he said but
YOU1000000033_S0000097	before we go i just wanted to mention our leadership team up here and our prophecy team feel called to pray for two men who are here today there was about fifteen hundred people in the crowd and they pointed us out and we weren't even members of the conference so we didn't even think they were talking to us
YOU1000000033_S0000098	eventually they said it's you two would you be willing to have our team pray with you we looked at each other and said all right why not and so everybody got excused for lunch we went up there with the team and a mature group of people
YOU1000000033_S0000099	and they started praying for us with ralph and i'm just kind of watching and and it was one of the first times where i saw ah the gift of prophecy kind of a word of knowledge working in a in a very powerful way
YOU1000000033_S0000100	and they started saying things about ralph and about his life which they couldn't have known that were indications of how god had worked in him and the and what the lord wanted to do with him
YOU1000000033_S0000101	then so i'm thinking whoa this is probably get a little too close i don't think i wanna listen i think i wanna go before it's my turn kind of thing and so anyway they prayed over me and they said ah one person said the lord is gonna start sewing you into lands all around the world
YOU1000000033_S0000103	and he's gonna bring to you men and women who he has already he has already called and he has already ah empowered to be able to stand alongside you and the one person said yeah i see these these images of battleships all lined up
YOU1000000033_S0000104	and they are all equipped and they are all ready to go and the lord wants you to launch them and those battleships are people and bishops and priests and laypeople that god has called to go to the world to engage the new evangelization and he wants you guys to help launch them
YOU1000000033_S0000105	and so after it was all done we were driving home and saying wow what do you think of that you know and the ralph said just said you know scripture is very clear it says to never despise prophecy but test everything and cling to what is good
YOU1000000033_S0000106	so we began to pray once a week together to say lord if this is you we are ready to receive it if it's not you we weren't working together at that time we were just we were in the same community the same parish but were renewal ministries hadn't yet happened with us together
YOU1000000033_S0000107	and so we decided to pray and then we invited sister ann and a few others once a week to pray with us we would pray each week and try to listen and week after week we would say anybody hearing anything you know ah from the lord no where we're supposed to go no
YOU1000000033_S0000108	and then at one point a couple of months into it sister ann shields said at the end of the prayer time she goes this sounds kind of strange you guys but i think we're supposed to go to lithuania and ukraine
YOU1000000033_S0000109	so here we are in the basement of a house here in ann arbor sister ann gets a sense we are supposed to go to lithuania we don't know anybody there two weeks later the bishop of the cultural center of the country calls us and said would you come and help me
YOU1000000033_S0000110	and what we had heard prophetically from folks who prayed for us said only go through doors that god is gonna open he will open the doors for you it started in lithuania and then it went to slovakia and then it went to hungary and then it went to ukraine and now it's forty countries around the world
YOU1000000033_S0000112	and that's kind of how it all happened and we start once we started we said okay clearly god is calling us what are we gonna do so we formed an organization renewal ministries that's how it happened
YOU1000000033_S0000114	this thought came into my head i want you on catholic radio
YOU1000000033_S0000116	and catholic radio
YOU1000000033_S0000118	didn't exist except for some work at e w t n but that was it
YOU1000000033_S0000120	and it was just i want you on catholic radio and i i thought
YOU1000000033_S0000121	so i went to ralph and i cause this is what you do when you get some thought you know is it indigestion or is it a world from the lord and i said look what ralph i don't even know if catholic radio exists
YOU1000000033_S0000123	and he said well let's let's just pray
YOU1000000033_S0000125	and six months later i got this call from e w t n asking me if i would be willing to do a radio program on on their station and i said yes
YOU1000000033_S0000126	and they said don't don't you need to talk to anybody about this or don't you need to pray about this and i said
YOU1000000033_S0000127	um no i think the lord prepared me and ralph had said just pray if it if something happens then we will know this is from the lord
YOU1000000033_S0000128	my religious community had prayed about it knew about it so when the invitation came it was like all the groundwork had been raised so it had been laid so from then on i found that's one of the main things i've been doing
YOU1000000033_S0000129	speaking writing parish missions all of that and then particularly focused on the radio
YOU1000000033_S0000130	we got into radio which we hadn't planned at the beginning sister ann's program food for the journey which is all over the place in the country it is a very dynamic radio show
YOU1000000033_S0000131	and then a few years after that i felt i was in a meeting with ralph just catching up seeing how things are going he said what's the lord saying to you these days and i said you know crazy i think i'm supposed to do radio
YOU1000000033_S0000132	ah we didn't have any money for it
YOU1000000033_S0000134	let's just see what the lord does if you are willing so we prayed and about a week later i got a call from mike jones from ave maria radio out of the blue and he said have you ever thought about doing radio
YOU1000000033_S0000135	i said yeah in fact i have and he said would you go into do a show with us i said i don't have any money he said well we'll do it we'll produce it just come and do the show so step by step things like that began to happen
YOU1000000033_S0000136	crossing the goal emerged ah another television show in e w t n that we collaborate together with a team danny abramowicz curtis martin and a variety of folks a show that was geared toward men
YOU1000000033_S0000137	and again it was something that was in my heart for years before i felt like the lord said
YOU1000000033_S0000139	you've got to start working to reach men and give them challenge them to dare to believe and to go for it i tried a few things and nothing really took off
YOU1000000033_S0000140	and but it was still in my heart and out of the blue danny and i met each other abramowicz ah ministries were so our desires and ministry so common we ended up combining together creating this other show so that has emerged
YOU1000000033_S0000141	another important piece of what we're doing is and have done from the beginning is is find a way to be able to engage more laypeople directly in ministry and evangelization
YOU1000000033_S0000142	so ah raised up more and more people to work with us internationally on mission teams going all over the world our country coordinators we call them
YOU1000000033_S0000143	and then ah the last few years with a with a heart for millennials we just felt like the lord said there's ah in the ann arbor area here there are lots of young people who have a serious call in their life from the lord and they have really grown a lot
YOU1000000033_S0000144	and they used had a lot of support and formation in their life and we felt like the lord said help release them into what i've called them to do make a way for them make a path so that's partly what we've done too that's where i d nine sixteen the young adult ministry emerged from
YOU1000000033_S0000145	a lot of really things the lord has called all of us to peter and sister ann and myself is to express in writing some of the things that we feel are the most important truths that people need to hear right now in our culture
YOU1000000033_S0000146	and so like for example ah one of the highlights for me was really finishing a book that i worked on for ten years it's called the fulfillment of all desire a guidebook for the journey to god based on the wisdom of the saints
YOU1000000033_S0000147	i just really felt like there's such a treasure of wisdom in our church in these great doctrines of the church but why god like used to happen to me years ago the first time i picked up a book by john of the cross it was like what
YOU1000000033_S0000148	what's he talking about and what he was talking about was so scary i decided to put the book down and then twenty-five years later just like it all kind of came alive for me and so i really felt like there is tremendous stuff here
YOU1000000033_S0000149	if you could just communicate it in a clear orderly understandable way people would get so much help in in growing in their union with the lord
YOU1000000033_S0000150	peter has written books like that and sister ann has written books like that and so part of part of the ministry is also the writing which which has helped an awful lot of people
YOU1000000033_S0000152	ah john paul was a kind of shepherd and guide for us he was the guy who interpreted for us what the spirit is saying to the church and it and it corresponded with what our sense was so he confirmed us in the mission
YOU1000000033_S0000153	we had gone to rome we were going a conference in rome and the last night that we were there ah we got a phone call from the holy father john paul asking if we would like to come to his mass the next morning
YOU1000000033_S0000154	and you know it was like like to you know of course so we ah we went there and after mass when he came to ralph who was next to me
YOU1000000033_S0000155	i gave him a copy of my latest book at the time called the catholic church at the end of the age what is the spirit saying he took the book and he said you know i read it already i almost fell over i almost became speechless
YOU1000000033_S0000156	then he turned to ralph and he took ralph by the upper arms he just took him and he kind of shook him like this and he said ralph tell me what is the spirit saying to the church
YOU1000000033_S0000158	and i knew he didn't want the whole three hundred page answer so i said holy father i think what the spirit is saying to the church is jesus so he took my hand and he said jesus and i said jesus
YOU1000000033_S0000159	we just stood there for a couple of minutes saying the name of jesus and it was just a very very special moment of communion with the lord and communion with the pope and just proclaiming the name of jesus together it was just very very special
YOU1000000033_S0000160	john paul second is our patron and one of our one of our central the central patron maybe of ah renewal ministries and so he is a great intercessor for us we continue to pray we ask for his help i feel his presence especially when i am on mission internationally
YOU1000000033_S0000161	in a very special way we have asked saint john paul second to be our patron we also ask mary
YOU1000000033_S0000162	you know she is the queen of the new evangelization she's she's appearing in the world she's carrying forth the message she's sort of like leading the charge in many ways
YOU1000000033_S0000163	and and we pray we try to stay close we try to listen you know to what's happening through the apparitions that are accepted by the church and what is the message there as well because it is prophetic
YOU1000000033_S0000164	it's a prophetic message and we feel like we are a prophetic ministry in part you know that we are meant to what is that mean we are meant to really dial in to try to hear what the spirit is saying to the church today and to be able to communicate that to other people
YOU1000000033_S0000165	what does god want
YOU1000000033_S0000167	from us who are his sons and daughters how are we called to live in this generation in this time and all of the challenges that we are certainly beginning to face
YOU1000000033_S0000168	because right now ah seventeen hundred years of christian culture is collapsing all kinds of supports that used to be there for living a moral life or all kinds of respect that used to be there for the church for the synagogue whatever just isn't there anymore
YOU1000000033_S0000169	and more and more we're living in the growth of an international pagan culture that is becoming increasingly hostile to christ and the church where is their loyalty
YOU1000000033_S0000170	what do they really think about jesus christ are they willing to suffer for him are they willing to suffer rather than to deny him are they willing to do everything they can to pass on the faith to their children
YOU1000000033_S0000171	even when the culture is placing tremendous obstacles in front of it so we are living in quite a time of conflict and decision it's for such a time as this that we have been called to do what we're doing
YOU1000000033_S0000172	and i hope that renewal ministries can help people make the decision that they are gonna be friends of jesus christ and they are gonna be loyal to him even in the midst of tremendous oppression and and difficulties
YOU1000000033_S0000173	the culture is lethal
YOU1000000033_S0000175	right now it's it's not just kind of you know enticing you
YOU1000000033_S0000176	it's it's just taking people and taking them right out of the framework in which they have lived with the little faith that perhaps they have had
YOU1000000033_S0000177	even if their faith is strong the enticements of the world are now so strong that if people aren't really rooted in god they can they can easily be pulled out without even realizing at first what's happening to them
YOU1000000033_S0000178	so it's in all these ways that i think renewal ministries brings a message it brings the love of god it helps people right where they are you don't have to be ashamed of where you are
YOU1000000033_S0000179	ah just come come and learn the love that god has for you come and learn the mercy that he has for you and then see as you become a disciple of christ see how he wants to use you in a world that is pretty broken
YOU1000000033_S0000181	you know peter when you're right in the middle of it every day and you're getting up every day and doing what you're supposed to do sometimes you don't get the whole trajectory of what god's done and it is just amazing see what the lord has done with with us
YOU1000000033_S0000182	yeah it's been it's been an amazing journey
YOU1000000033_S0000184	a number of things came to mind thinking about it it's not like we had a grand plan at the beginning
YOU1000000033_S0000185	no
YOU1000000033_S0000186	it was the lord was getting our attention and he said look i want you to do something and it was step by step we had help from other people just encouragement in the spirit
YOU1000000033_S0000187	you know i was just thinking how ah pope john paul second used to say saint john paul second and now pope francis so you know that the part of the spirit's ah mission is to reveal jesus to every human heart but to create movement
YOU1000000033_S0000188	and as we together were encountering the spirit more deeply he moved us and he and he moved other people and and it was like we were carried along
YOU1000000033_S0000189	yeah
YOU1000000033_S0000190	so it's just really great
YOU1000000033_S0000191	yeah
YOU1000000033_S0000192	yeah
YOU1000000033_S0000193	no it's really encouraging it really is true the holy spirit leads people he led us he can lead anybody it's just really amazing and just the way you told the story about how we got launched into you know lithuania and you know all the other countries we are in
YOU1000000033_S0000194	and and to this day i mean like very week we are getting reports from our country coordinators who are doing tremendous things in so many countries around the world
YOU1000000033_S0000195	right and continues to do it this past year we did you know last year we did forty-one international missions in about thirty-five different countries in eastern europe africa asia the middle east and collaborating with just some amazing people you know ah cardinal turks you just put you know
YOU1000000033_S0000196	clergy religious laity from all over the world in a partnership i mean we don't as i mentioned we don't you know go hang up our shingle around the world and get people to join our organization
YOU1000000033_S0000197	the lord just has given us gifts and experience and resources to come alongside these brothers and sisters around the world and partner with them in a communion and mission that is is our contribution to this great moment of evangelization and new evangelization in the church
YOU1000000033_S0000198	yeah and we we always thought that the lord had given us something that could really help strengthen leadership in the church the lord has given us so many opportunities now to do that
YOU1000000033_S0000199	you know i just i just got back from doing a workshop for deacons in the archdiocese of hartford about ready to go to do a clergy convocation in calgary
YOU1000000033_S0000200	you and sister ann recently did the clergy convocation with the archdiocese of detroit so we are getting opportunities to really strengthen priests and deacons and give them courage and give them confidence you know in in preaching the gospel
YOU1000000033_S0000201	and that's somewhat new you know what i mean we we've always done that overseas in different places but i think here in the states you you have done it more than the rest of us but it seems like the doors are kind of thrown wide open because they are recognizing it
YOU1000000033_S0000202	so well you guys do have something god has given you something we want to listen to it we want you to come and help us out because i think we need it
YOU1000000033_S0000203	yeah i think i think the church is waking up to the fact that you know what i think we need god yeah i think we need power from on high i think we need something more
YOU1000000033_S0000204	you know because the the tsunami of secularism is just engulfing people's lives and the statistics are just getting more and more grim and the decline of things
YOU1000000033_S0000205	and we are trying to tell tell bishops and priests and deacons that you don't want to just kind of preside over decline and downsizing you want to generate a new energy of of evangelization and pentecost that can really turn the tide
YOU1000000033_S0000206	and live the new pentecost
YOU1000000033_S0000207	amen amen a culture of pentecost well peter ah we have so much to be grateful for one of the things we have to be grateful for is this booklet you have written which is called light in the darkness
YOU1000000033_S0000208	jesus is the light in the darkness and we want you to have this booklet at no cost just for the asking and we will be back
YOU1000000033_S0000210	friends we're living through difficult and challenging times the church is in a fierce battle
YOU1000000033_S0000211	in the words of pope emeritus benedict the sixteenth man is pushing god from the human horizon and as a result the light which comes from god is disappearing and humanity is losing its bearings
YOU1000000033_S0000212	in this moment it's crucial that we hear the words of jesus who said i'm the light of the world he who follows me will not walk in darkness but will have the light
YOU1000000033_S0000213	of life i wrote this short booklet to help you lay hold of this precious promise from jesus so you can have the strength and the courage you need to be a light in the darkness

YOU1000000037_S0000250	chris at multi-tank addiction also an artist um back in the studio i've got some of his art both prints and originals fantastic fish are priscilla n k who's often in the chat here

YOU1000000037_S0000253	i think this fish art is really catching on because we fish keepers can appreciate it and it's a wonderful introduction to fish to people who don't have an aquarium they can have a a painting of a fish
YOU1000000037_S0000255	and i think if we can connect the two um fish art to people who don't have aquariums to people who have fish art and aquariums we can teach them how to keep an aquarium at least efficiently if not easily

YOU1000000037_S0000291	very good i didn't see any top dwelling asian fish i'm sure you guys i thought about the asian ah arowana ah and of course the koi feed at the surface and so did the goldfish
YOU1000000037_S0000292	so all those came to mind what about um asian mid swimmers
YOU1000000037_S0000294	we go down a level and the water column and the community tank ah because it's ten fifty-seven ninety-two of you still watching thank you it's almost eleven o'clock we're almost at the halfway point
YOU1000000037_S0000295	we're down to the middle of the water column talking about the best asian fish for the middle of the water call and i noticed my koi also sometimes like to swim around
YOU1000000037_S0000296	and the ah the middle of the water column they rest on the bottom that swim in the middle they speed on the top that's that's what i see
YOU1000000037_S0000298	um by the way i did see some bottom-dwelling mona jump ahead here i'm gonna let's talk about the video first and i'll look for a photograph of a bottom-dwelling asian fish i want to show you guys um
YOU1000000037_S0000300	the video that i put out tuesday we did the premiere thank you guys who showed that for the premiere

YOU1000000037_S0000310	sure i can't for you guys i can't um
YOU1000000037_S0000312	it's it's not performing at the rate that would like for it to it's falling below the average ah rate there's some really cool shrimp um
YOU1000000037_S0000314	and i don't know i don't know exactly i don't have that algorithm figured out but i was a little surprised that it had such a wonderful premiere and you guys showed up and then the performance afterwards just seemed to slow
YOU1000000037_S0000315	so hopefully it'll make the turn and pick back up the name of the video with shrimp capades i've got some freshwater shrimp blue shrimp
YOU1000000037_S0000317	and ah neo gherdeina they're like a they're like some blue fantasy dreams i used to have from flip aquatics
YOU1000000037_S0000318	but i've got them from the local fish store who sold them as shrimp assorted
YOU1000000037_S0000320	so i purchase three blue shrimps assorted and put them at one point five gallon
YOU1000000037_S0000322	did a video loved the video those shrimps are such a cute little rascals
YOU1000000037_S0000324	i think if you'll check that out you'll enjoy it the things got video since tuesday has one hundred ninety-four reviews as at the time we went on air forty-eight likes so
YOU1000000037_S0000326	it's it's a little slow out of the gate after it launched well that kind of slowed down on the gate so it's good video i hope you guys watch it let me know what you think
YOU1000000037_S0000328	and now it is eleven o'clock let's get down to the bottom of the tank bottom of the water column and this is the point where we talk about the changes in the river life fish studio
YOU1000000037_S0000329	and if you've been following along with us here in the community tank you know the fish studio is under construction but we're going very slow now waiting on some structural changes to the house so that's gonna happen when it happens
YOU1000000037_S0000330	ah we've done it on a priority list we're getting closer every day but it's gonna be minor changes until the structural changes arrive and at that time we also talked about the fish at the bottom of the water column
YOU1000000037_S0000332	so here's a video i made today
YOU1000000037_S0000334	i think the striking goldfish but this vendor also had some bottom dwellers look at all the banded harpoon sharks look at all those little guys
YOU1000000037_S0000336	they are couple hundred of those and i think those are outstanding bottom-dwelling asian fish they get up to three feet long
YOU1000000037_S0000338	thirty thirty-six inches
YOU1000000037_S0000339	and the vendor told me they could withstand temperatures down to negative twenty-two fahrenheit twenty-two degrees below zero amazing
YOU1000000037_S0000341	so i think i'm gonna have to have a couple of those in my life i'm actually ordered
YOU1000000037_S0000343	sharks before but ah half and banded sharks but they didn't derive ah i've had a couple of issues with getting them so i'm still without and here i am at the show and there are dozens if not hundreds
YOU1000000037_S0000345	so i think there's gonna be one or two of those in my life
YOU1000000037_S0000347	gourami and paradise fish
YOU1000000037_S0000349	huh
YOU1000000037_S0000351	neither of which i associated previously as being asian i'm gonna look at that
YOU1000000037_S0000353	that's funny all those beauties in the bathroom how does she do it
YOU1000000037_S0000355	we're talking about simply betters fish true being in a bathroom
YOU1000000037_S0000357	and simply betta says just go vertical vertical baby it's not difficult
YOU1000000037_S0000359	alien world aquatics is in the house and before i forget again alien world let me say
YOU1000000037_S0000361	and if you needed rewind this and watch it on replay
YOU1000000037_S0000362	the dart frogs i recommend for you are the larger terrestrial dart frogs the green and black dart frog
YOU1000000037_S0000363	its scientific name
YOU1000000037_S0000365	ah ends in erratas
YOU1000000037_S0000367	ah formerly was dendera babies so they still used dendera babies that's changed so many other genus dendera babies are oddest and the tinctorius dendera babies tinctorius
YOU1000000037_S0000368	ah those are diurnal no they're awake during the day their call is a very soft buzz you have to have your ear to the tank if you want to hear the male's call and then thirdly the luka mela
YOU1000000037_S0000369	the dendera babies luka mela that's the bumblebee or yellow and black poison dart frog and it has a very audible call it's a loud trill that reminds you of the jungle so it's pretty cool
YOU1000000037_S0000370	but they don't have an on off switch okay so if you love it that's the one to go with but if you're not sure you're gonna like that jungle trail in your house during the day it won't bother you at night
YOU1000000037_S0000371	but during the day you may want to steer clear of the local melon
YOU1000000037_S0000373	but those are all larger beautiful and the tinctoria sigh mentioned it's like blue and bright yellow and variants of both yellow back blue legs look them up online there's millions of um
YOU1000000037_S0000375	photographs and of course on youtube there's lots of videos that's my recommendation for you stay away from the smaller thumbnail size frogs they're more arboreal more temperamental more demanding as far as environment goes
YOU1000000037_S0000376	and the dealer that ah i have i don't know many i'm out of the loop but but one that i have confidence in is josh's frogs
YOU1000000037_S0000377	and he had no idea i was gonna say that this is not an advertisement snot sponsored ah just
YOU1000000037_S0000379	i recognized some good customer service practices there and healthy frogs and great customer support so a terrestrial frog one of the three i mentioned i think are all great beginner frogs and an affordable price
YOU1000000037_S0000380	um i actually did well with the azureus which now is a subspecies of the tinctorius it's just solid blue with black spots pretty amazing

YOU1000000039_S0000001	this week we take to the turkey woods it was youth season in missouri and arkansas and the growing deer team jumps at every opportunity to take a kid hunting taking a young hunter can present some challenges
YOU1000000039_S0000002	but the opportunity to introduce someone to creation through a hunting experience well that's priceless
YOU1000000039_S0000003	twenty pounds one ounce that's good for him yeah
YOU1000000039_S0000005	growing deer is brought to you by bass pro shops reconyx trophy rock eagle seed nikon winchester dead down wind antler dirt lacrosse footwear bloodsport arrows

YOU1000000039_S0000007	l e m game processing fourth arrow g five broadheads prime bows and redneck hunting blinds
YOU1000000039_S0000009	missouri's youth season is two days long and always a week before the regular season opens anyone fifteen or younger is classified as a youth hunter rae is fourteen so adam rae and i were eager to head out saturday morning
YOU1000000039_S0000011	we'd been using reconyx cameras to scout the proving grounds for several months now and we had a pretty good idea which ridgetops and food plots turkeys were using as threat zones
YOU1000000039_S0000012	based on studying reconyx pictures and videos there's one clover field on top of a ridge we call boomerang that seemed to have the most activity
YOU1000000039_S0000014	missouri's youth season usually corresponds with the very early part of the turkey breeding season and at this time the hens are still in flocks but gobblers aren't far behind
YOU1000000039_S0000015	the hens are pretty much on it get off the roost and feeding pattern daily they're not all spread out seeking nesting habitat and it's a great time to pattern turkeys
YOU1000000039_S0000016	about a week before youth season opened we moved a redneck hay bale blind at the edge of the power line overlooking the clover food plot
YOU1000000039_S0000018	we set out a miss perfect decoy and settled in the blind way before daylight it was a really enjoyable time watching and listening till all the critters come to life as the sun peaked over the horizon
YOU1000000039_S0000020	the three of us were listening to several toms gobbling in the distance but after a while three birds fired up what we assumed to be about two hundred yards in front of us and we knew those were the toms we were after
YOU1000000039_S0000022	so it's fun listening to gobblers when you know the terrain and trying to imagine where they are as these gobblers started closing the distance adam and i both agreed they were really close to a redneck blind
YOU1000000039_S0000023	that was about one hundred and fifty yards in front of us just over the hill and through some timber
YOU1000000039_S0000025	i couldn't really tell if they were moving toward us or kind of just going back and forth on the ridge adam hit the call one more time and there was no doubt in my mind those toms had committed and were coming our way
YOU1000000039_S0000027	listening to them gobble we thought they were right on the ridge top and it wasn't long till we saw those white heads coming down the logging road
YOU1000000039_S0000028	i see them
YOU1000000039_S0000030	three
YOU1000000039_S0000032	can i shoot one
YOU1000000039_S0000034	i'll be shooting the goal from
YOU1000000039_S0000036	he's too close
YOU1000000039_S0000038	okay
YOU1000000039_S0000040	you nailed him rae
YOU1000000039_S0000042	look at him watch him
YOU1000000039_S0000044	that's a big one rae
YOU1000000039_S0000046	i didn't flinch
YOU1000000039_S0000047	no you were perfect you nailed him
YOU1000000039_S0000049	whoa some good hooks rae
YOU1000000039_S0000050	yeah
YOU1000000039_S0000052	good spurs look at those
YOU1000000039_S0000053	um hmm
YOU1000000039_S0000054	that's a little longer they're both good probably a three-year-old bird
YOU1000000039_S0000055	ah hmm
YOU1000000039_S0000057	and oh man look at that
YOU1000000039_S0000058	um it's really long
YOU1000000039_S0000060	well they are beautiful feathers aren't they
YOU1000000039_S0000061	yeah they look kind of bluish
YOU1000000039_S0000062	yep and this
YOU1000000039_S0000064	boy you've peppered his head
YOU1000000039_S0000066	he didn't flop around much did he
YOU1000000039_S0000067	nope
YOU1000000039_S0000069	well
YOU1000000039_S0000071	get him out here where we can take some pictures and go back and take him to the house
YOU1000000039_S0000072	definitely
YOU1000000039_S0000073	rae made a great shot and that tom barely flopped we got out and inspected the turkey shared some hugs and talked about the hunt after we kind of settled down a little bit and we've taken a few pictures
YOU1000000039_S0000074	i stepped off from the turkey back to the hay bale blind and it was forty-eight steps forty-eight yards i gotta tell you before we started using winchester long beard x r i would have never given her the okay to take that shot
YOU1000000039_S0000075	but through patterning and experience i was fully confident she'd take that tom down
YOU1000000039_S0000077	based on the spur length about an inch and three sixteens the tom is probably three years old that's a good tom anywhere but it was an even better hunt the birds gobbled good responded to the call and there was plenty of excitement as they were approaching
YOU1000000039_S0000078	more importantly it was just a fun hunt to share with my daughter rae
YOU1000000039_S0000080	after every successful hunt i like to take a little time and see what the critter has been eating i call this scouting from the skinning shed
YOU1000000039_S0000082	twenty-three and a half twenty-three and a half good tom for the ozarks and it's an easy ten a little bit over ten inches on the beard
YOU1000000039_S0000083	sharing a hunt with family and friends is really important and just as important is properly preparing the meat we all should be thankful when we harvest game and that natural source of meat to feed our families the first thing to do of course is remove the beard
YOU1000000039_S0000085	so i just put my hand at the base and give it a good tug
YOU1000000039_S0000087	and there it is nice full beard turn the turkey up right where his breastbone is to me and i just wanna open up and see what's in his crop probably not much because we called this turkey right off the roost we could hear him in a tree hear him hit the ground
YOU1000000039_S0000088	different call sound or a different volume anyway so i doubt he's fed much but we'll see
YOU1000000039_S0000090	and i wanna cut out away from the feathers if you cut in you're gonna get feathers all over the meat
YOU1000000039_S0000092	and you can tell where it's still very early in their breeding season look at all this fat in a week or two if we harvest a tom i predict it won't have near as much fat as now
YOU1000000039_S0000093	and you also notice still full of breast feathers that means they're not breeding much yet they haven't worn those breast feathers off so it kind of gives you a good gauge of where the local turkey population is in the breeding cycle
YOU1000000039_S0000095	this turkey of course came off the roost and it's so empty i'm feeling right here and there's nothing in his crop when i opened up the crop in the tom rae harvested there was nothing in it
YOU1000000039_S0000096	apparently that old tom came off the roost and started working right toward our setup
YOU1000000039_S0000098	usually when you open up a deer's stomach or a turkey's crop there's great information that tells us where turkeys are spending time eating but when you shoot a tom that came to you right off the roost often time there will be nothing in his crop
YOU1000000039_S0000100	pro staffers heath and lindsey martin also had the opportunity to take a youth hunting this past weekend they went on a youth hunt set up by scott hook of hook's custom calls the hunt was organized in north central arkansas
YOU1000000039_S0000103	once they arrived in camp they met up with scott and their youth hunter gracie pate gracie's thirteen and has tagged a few deer but never been able to tag a turkey
YOU1000000039_S0000104	so what are you most excited about for the weekend
YOU1000000039_S0000105	um probably tomorrow morning just getting out there and being able to hear all of them hopefully get a new turkey
YOU1000000039_S0000106	does have you ever had a chance to hear very many turkeys
YOU1000000039_S0000107	um one
YOU1000000039_S0000108	once okay
YOU1000000039_S0000109	would you like to add any pressure to mister martin about getting you a bird tomorrow do you know he feels a lot of pressure to get you a bird
YOU1000000039_S0000110	i'm feeling a lot of pressure to shoot the bird
YOU1000000039_S0000112	after introductions and getting to know each other they headed over to the farm where they were going to hunt and did a little scouting
YOU1000000039_S0000114	the next morning is the opening day but during the night a strong cold front came in and bring with a very high winds and apparently gave all the turkeys lockjaw
YOU1000000039_S0000116	after a couple hours of walking around and calling they can't hear any turkeys responded to the high wind so he decides he need to find a high spot that's out of wind and see if they can hear a turkey respond
YOU1000000039_S0000118	after forty-five minutes they had a turkey respond and now they're hurrying to get set up
YOU1000000039_S0000120	even though this tom gobbled at every call heath threw at him he wouldn't close the distance
YOU1000000039_S0000121	we were sitting here talking about our border border collies and labs and mister heath decided to call a little bit and we had a gob a lonely gobbler gobble back at us and we got set up then got our decoys out
YOU1000000039_S0000123	and about that time we just couldn't get him to come in
YOU1000000039_S0000125	so now what's the plan
YOU1000000039_S0000127	well i got a rodeo this evening so we gotta leave a little early and go to the rodeo and then hopefully we'll get out here in the morning
YOU1000000039_S0000129	that tom wouldn't commit to come to the calls and gracie had prior obligations that afternoon so heath took gracie back to camp and met up with scott hook and spent the afternoon hunting with scott and his youth hunter cade
YOU1000000039_S0000130	here with my young hunter cade cook and his grandfather mitchell some friends told us of an area that birds like to hang out mid-day we're gonna try to slip in there and set up and just sit around and listen call a little bit and maybe we can get him a shot
YOU1000000039_S0000131	a few minutes into the property they had a cool interaction with a hen and even though this hen was very chatty no gobbler responded
YOU1000000039_S0000133	they ended up moving further in the property and having a gobbler respond to their calls they scrambled to get set up but this tom worked his way in silently and wouldn't give cade a good shot
YOU1000000039_S0000135	it was a fun day with some good interactions but neither gracie or cade tagged a turkey but they were ready to go the next morning
YOU1000000039_S0000137	multiple birds were roosted that evening so a second youth hunter joined gracie the next morning
YOU1000000039_S0000139	heath's group set up close to the roost site and one of the birds responded but simply didn't present a good shot through all the brush in the area
YOU1000000039_S0000141	the wind has started to lay a little bit but we're we're still at it we're we're bound and determined we're gonna get one
YOU1000000039_S0000143	after that first set up the group was working hard to get gracie on a tom before her deadline to leave for church
YOU1000000039_S0000145	they got on another tom and got their decoy set up and with a little calling it sounds like that tom is closing the distance
YOU1000000039_S0000147	bird down congratulations gracie on your first turkey
YOU1000000039_S0000148	good job how exciting was that
YOU1000000039_S0000149	it was pretty good
YOU1000000039_S0000151	i could just hear shoot shoot shoot so i just tried to get a shot off
YOU1000000039_S0000153	shoot shoot
YOU1000000039_S0000154	i bet they were

YOU1000000039_S0000162	thank you i sure do appreciate you all
YOU1000000039_S0000164	congratulations
YOU1000000039_S0000166	there's one on the back of it
YOU1000000039_S0000168	after all the celebration scott does a great job of explaining why it's important to introduce youth to hunting
YOU1000000039_S0000169	um it requires patience requires a little understanding knowledge of your your adversary in the woods if if you get down to the most basic things of turkey hunting it can really teach you some lessons in life
YOU1000000039_S0000170	and i'm still trying to learn the patience thing that still hasn't stuck with me yet
YOU1000000039_S0000172	where you managed to get a bird this morning miss gracie killed a bird this morning
YOU1000000039_S0000174	there's a lot of emotions involved in taking anyone hunting youth or adult new or experienced hunter there is enjoying creation there's the potential and the follow through of taking the life of another critter
YOU1000000039_S0000175	and there's the joy of providing quality food for your family i can't think of any better tool than hunting for teaching life's lessons
YOU1000000039_S0000176	thanks to heath lindsey and scott for volunteering their time to introduce several youth to hunting this past weekend in arkansas
YOU1000000039_S0000178	during the same weekend matt tagged along with seth harker and his son trace during missouri's youth season
YOU1000000039_S0000180	trace was excited as last season he took his first gobbler
YOU1000000039_S0000182	dude that's a good shot buddy
YOU1000000039_S0000184	this year trace was set on taking a long beard and seth and matt were more than willing to help him meet that goal
YOU1000000039_S0000186	the morning started out great as the guys got some turkeys fired up off the roost
YOU1000000039_S0000188	sure enough two long beards entered the plot strutting spitting drumming and gobbling they put on quite a show
YOU1000000039_S0000189	yeah that's awesome ain't it do not move a lot until they get in front of your gun barrel
YOU1000000039_S0000191	one of the challenges of taking a youth hunting is getting them set up right and predicting where the turkey is going to approach
YOU1000000039_S0000193	why why didn't i just point the gun down the logging road when we got here and i seen them coming up the road i was like
YOU1000000039_S0000195	why am i set up like this
YOU1000000039_S0000197	did you ever think it
YOU1000000039_S0000199	not until they got right there and i'm like okay i'm good and they move it's like oh
YOU1000000039_S0000201	i i thought they were just gonna come out see the decoys and just strut right to them but
YOU1000000039_S0000202	he was about ready to just shake off
YOU1000000039_S0000203	i was i i got cause
YOU1000000039_S0000205	he s in the frame and i could see the gun going
YOU1000000039_S0000207	this hunt was a great example of not having a youth hunter pointed the right direction due to the unpredictability of turkeys even though it didn't work out with a tagged turkey it was a great start to their hunt
YOU1000000039_S0000209	yep
YOU1000000039_S0000211	turkeys would have been dead
YOU1000000039_S0000213	one reason we've been experiencing some great turkey hunts here at the proving grounds is our intensive predator management program
YOU1000000039_S0000215	we've worked for years to balance the predator and prey populations we use trapping to reduce the amount of predators and the results of that have been very high survival rates of turkey poults and fawns
YOU1000000039_S0000217	there's another benefit to trapping and that's acquiring the beautiful pelts i saved up some pelts for a couple years and had miss tracy a beautiful raccoon blanket made with a coyote trim
YOU1000000039_S0000218	i love to turkey hunt so every year we catch several raccoons here at the proving grounds and people often ask what do you do with all those pelts well raccoon pelts make a beautiful gift and there's lots of things you can do
YOU1000000039_S0000219	but this year i went above and beyond i took several of the pelts that were about the same size that i had caught in previous years and i had miss tracy a beautiful
YOU1000000039_S0000221	large raccoon blanket made
YOU1000000039_S0000223	and how about those pesky coyotes we catch had a coyote buffer put on the outside
YOU1000000039_S0000225	blankets made out of pelts kept native americans warm for centuries this one at least based on what i've seen in museums is probably a little bit more refined
YOU1000000039_S0000227	the process was really simple of course we trapped the predators skinned fleshed and dried the pelts had a tannery prepare them at a garment tan or a very soft had another vender produce this beautiful blanket
YOU1000000039_S0000228	now that there's fewer predators at the proving grounds both me lots of turkeys and fawns will sleep better this spring
YOU1000000039_S0000230	i surprised tracy with this blanket and she was thrilled it's an absolutely gorgeous addition to our home and no doubt will keep us warm for many winters to come
YOU1000000039_S0000231	each week i share a reminder with all of us to slow down and listen to the critters daily i can't think of a better way than sitting on a ridgetop before daylight waiting for turkeys to gobble
YOU1000000039_S0000232	but no matter where you are i hope you take time to enjoy creation this week and slow down every day and listen to what the critter is saying to you thanks for watching growing deer
YOU1000000039_S0000234	okay

YOU1000000043_S0000008	now sociible is a platform that will allow you to post content other people's content on social media

YOU1000000043_S0000011	in this bonus i cover my strategy for finding proven buyers of products on facebook
YOU1000000043_S0000012	and then adding them either to your friends list to your pages or to your groups and then you can use a software like sociible to promote your offers to those people
YOU1000000043_S0000013	so this goes really really well together with sociible obviously with sociible you're going to be able to post on facebook
YOU1000000043_S0000014	but if you don't already have a targeted group of people to post too then ah you're not gonna get a lot of results
YOU1000000043_S0000015	with this you'll be able to get results really quickly
YOU1000000043_S0000016	because you already have proven buyers on your facebook friends list or in your facebook groups and then those people are much more likely to follow your offers that you gonna be posting with sociible
YOU1000000043_S0000017	bonus number two is how to write killer headlines now if you gonna post on social media or you wanna buy um build your email list one thing you absolutely need to be able to do is get people's attention
YOU1000000043_S0000018	now there's no better way to get someone's attention than with a really good headline
YOU1000000043_S0000019	the problem is it could could take you months of trying to learn copywriting to write effective headlines yourself
YOU1000000043_S0000020	while however if you do what i do you just go to the best copywriters in the world find out what kind of headlines they write
YOU1000000043_S0000021	and then model your own headlines based on those headlines you'll be able to take a shortcut and do this in just minutes
YOU1000000043_S0000022	now in bonus number two i show you exactly where to go to find this killer headlines and then how to use those to base your own headlines on them
YOU1000000043_S0000023	bonus number three is all about how to pick a good niche now with sociible you can actually do affiliate marketing in almost any niche
YOU1000000043_S0000024	however you do have to pick a good niche for you to be able to actually make money with it
YOU1000000043_S0000025	so in bonus number three i cover what good niches are when it comes to affiliate marketing and how to decide which one to pick for yourself
YOU1000000043_S0000026	bonus number four is my email marketing fundamentals course
YOU1000000043_S0000027	now with sociible as i said one of the things you can do is build your email list with this traffic that you're going to be generating with the software
YOU1000000043_S0000028	after you start building your email list of course you wanna know what to actually do with that email list
YOU1000000043_S0000029	ah first of all which software you can use to collect your leads how to set that up
YOU1000000043_S0000030	and then also how to write effective emails to those people on your list so you can actually turn the leads into sales now all of that is covered inside my email marketing fundamentals course
YOU1000000043_S0000031	so that is bonus number four
YOU1000000043_S0000032	and then bonus number five last but not least my facebook retargeting course
YOU1000000043_S0000033	now if you're going to be using sociible traffic ah one way you can easily double your results with very very minimal budget is by adding facebook retargeting on top of it
YOU1000000043_S0000034	now i use facebook retargeting in my own business and every time i do i see my results go up so much more
YOU1000000043_S0000035	because let's face it even if ah fifty percent of the people that visit your website sign up your mailing list
YOU1000000043_S0000036	which obviously isn't going to happen it's probably a lot less than that it's probably like twenty percent but even then you're losing half of your traffic
YOU1000000043_S0000037	now when you do facebook retargeting you get another chance to target those people who didn't initially sign up
YOU1000000043_S0000038	and get them onto your email list or get them to buy a product from you or a affiliate product that you are promoting
YOU1000000043_S0000039	so this will allow you to retarget all those people that leave your website without taking action maybe they were just busy at that time maybe they didn't have time to look at your offer in more detail but they might still be interested
YOU1000000043_S0000040	now with facebook retargeting you have the chance to recapture those people get them onto your email list or ah get them to buy a product from you and this will definitely double your results
YOU1000000043_S0000041	now on top of my own bonuses i'm also going to give you access to all of the bonuses that the vendor provided me with to give to you
YOU1000000043_S0000042	now these bonuses are probably what all the other affiliates are going to be offering you
YOU1000000043_S0000043	and because i know that my bonuses are one of the best in the industry i don't want you to miss out on these vendor provided bonuses and i'm including those as well on top
YOU1000000043_S0000044	so bonus number one the vendors provided me with is a live ninety minute training and q and a session bonus two is a-hundred-and-ten profitable niches
YOU1000000043_S0000045	bonus three fifty-two product types that sell and bonus four six steps to instagram traffic success
YOU1000000043_S0000046	so those are bonuses that will be on top of my own bonuses ah for sociible when you purchase through the link and description below this video
YOU1000000043_S0000047	now on top of that when you purchase any of the upgrades to sociible i will also give you affiliation of my full affiliate marketing course
YOU1000000043_S0000048	now in this course i teach you exactly how i make between two-hundred and five-hundred dollars a day every single day with affiliate marketing
YOU1000000043_S0000049	now to prove that i'm not lying about that let me just quickly log into my j v zoo account and my warrior plus account to show you the kind of results i'm getting
YOU1000000043_S0000050	so today has only just started as i'm recording this not much there yet but yesterday two-hundred-forty-four on j v zoo and another a-hundred- and-one on warrior plus
YOU1000000043_S0000051	plus some more in some other networks so altogether well over four-hundred dollars in commissions for me yesterday
YOU1000000043_S0000052	and that is with the techniques i show inside my affiliation affiliate marketing course
YOU1000000043_S0000053	so that is available when you purchase sociible with any of the upgrades available to sociible

YOU1000000043_S0000055	now all of these bonuses will automatically be delivered inside your j v zoo account after your purchase

YOU1000000043_S0000060	so let's have a look inside the dashboard of this software and let me walk you through some of the features
YOU1000000043_S0000061	so first of all the dashboard that looks like this you can see an overview of how many things you have running at the moment inside the software of course
YOU1000000043_S0000062	there's a support link of course where you can um get in touch with the support team for sociible if any thing isn't working out for you
YOU1000000043_S0000063	and then the tutorials where you can see different videos on exactly how to use the software
YOU1000000043_S0000064	so here you can see the tutorial videos adding accounts and groups creating a content stream
YOU1000000043_S0000065	creating and adding stories to a content bucket connecting a aweber and grabresponse those are two email marketing platforms that you can use together with sociible so you can start building your list with it
YOU1000000043_S0000066	also adding amazon associate tags if you want to do amazon affiliate marketing with the software then there's built in features for that as well adding amazon products
YOU1000000043_S0000067	adding overlays i'll show you later what that means adding custom domains if you want to set this up on your own domain you can do that creating a campaign and checking your campaign stats
YOU1000000043_S0000068	so those are all training videos included but let me just quickly give you a walk through of the software
YOU1000000043_S0000069	so social accounts this is where you add your own social accounts so you can add a facebook pages twitter ah ah the
YOU1000000043_S0000070	i can't show you right now with all the options are but there's ah few different social accounts available so there is facebook twitter um
YOU1000000043_S0000071	yeah it's facebook ah and twitter those are the two social media platforms
YOU1000000043_S0000072	and then on facebook you can choose pages groups or your own personal account so then you post on your newsfeed
YOU1000000043_S0000073	so those are the three different facebook ah options and then there's twitter of course so those are the social accounts available
YOU1000000043_S0000074	so here you can see all the different account so i added one of my own facebook pages so i can post to that
YOU1000000043_S0000075	then ah here we have account groups so that will allow you to ah put accounts together in a group and then you can post to multiple accounts at the same time
YOU1000000043_S0000076	so if you want to post in a facebook on a facebook page in a facebook group and on your twitter account with ah with the same content
YOU1000000043_S0000077	then you can group them together with the software and then it will send that same content to all those accounts
YOU1000000043_S0000078	ah so content streams that is where you get your automated content so here we have an example of a contents stream now it is for weight loss
YOU1000000043_S0000079	i can't currently add another stream right now because the software isn't live yet it's gonna go live at eleven a m and i'm recording this a few hours before
YOU1000000043_S0000080	so right now i'm not able to add more content streams because they're working on it
YOU1000000043_S0000081	but ah there's one here already as an example unfortunately the key word chosen for weight loss wasn't weight loss but weight so the content is a little bit weird
YOU1000000043_S0000082	but let me show you because that basically covers so much ah so many different things use weight in their text
YOU1000000043_S0000083	so this doesn't cover just weight loss it's like here there is like some play station four game review um
YOU1000000043_S0000085	i don't know like automotive global industry so this is like a financial report on the automotive industries
YOU1000000043_S0000086	so as i said there's like a lots of different weird stuff going on here but what this would normally do if you put in a more proper keyword like how to lose weight that would've been way better
YOU1000000043_S0000087	then you can see all sorts of articles from all over the web on how to lose weight now we're not going to steal these articles all we're doing is linking directly
YOU1000000043_S0000088	to the original content to the original article but then we're gonna be able to put our own affiliate ah link or ah list
YOU1000000043_S0000089	building pop up on top of that so what you can do you can add this content to a bucket
YOU1000000043_S0000090	and then you have these buckets over here so let me show you what that is so we here we have a bucket
YOU1000000043_S0000091	then i can go click on view and then you see all the different articles that are currently in the bucket
YOU1000000043_S0000092	now if you don't like the articles that the content streams came up with and you want to use your own articles that you find anywhere on the web
YOU1000000043_S0000093	you can just enter u r l here and that will add a custom article from anywhere on the internet to your bucket
YOU1000000043_S0000094	so if i go for example to ah c n n dot com ah or let do c n n world news
YOU1000000043_S0000096	and then um here just grab this and then what's going on beyonce performs at this party
YOU1000000043_S0000097	so then you just copy paste this article ah and then i can go into sociible for here add this to the story
YOU1000000043_S0000099	or add the story to the ah bucket and then ah it should be in here somewhere
YOU1000000043_S0000100	i guess it's on the next page oh on this is the one isha ambani's wedding included special performance by beyonce so i just added that as a extra story on in my bucket of stories
YOU1000000043_S0000101	but this bucket is automatically filled by stories from your content streams when you set those up as well
YOU1000000043_S0000102	then overlays that's ah as i said overlays is basically ah where the money is this is the main functionality of the software
YOU1000000043_S0000103	so obviously getting this content is part of it but then once you have the content what do you do with it how do monetize it well we're going to use it either to build our list or to send people to affiliate offers with its content
YOU1000000043_S0000104	so what you can do with this overlays let me see if i can add more of those yeah
YOU1000000043_S0000105	so you can either add a bar a pop up a notification a full screen pop up or an amazon product on top of that content
YOU1000000043_S0000106	so let me just set up a pop up in this case and then we have a different pop ups that we can choose
YOU1000000043_S0000107	um so let's do this call to action one then you can see um so this would be directing people directly to an affiliate offers
YOU1000000043_S0000108	so let's not choose at that one but let's choose one that is to build our list so that would be opt in then um we can say join our community we can give a discount code
YOU1000000043_S0000109	so you can see all these different templates they have already created so that makes it super easy to get started with this
YOU1000000043_S0000110	so this is a good list building pop up in my opinion because it's pretty basic and simple yet at the same time very eye catching
YOU1000000043_S0000111	ah so now you could change of course all of the text over here um so i can just type my own and i will change the headline over here
YOU1000000043_S0000112	now this of course is one reason why i'm including my bonus number two on how to write killer headlines because you're going to have to create your own headline in this pop up
YOU1000000043_S0000113	and you want to make sure that this is a catchy headline that people are going to want to opt in to your list um for
YOU1000000043_S0000114	so this is a headline that really intrigues people and makes them want to know more about what you're talking about and then as a consequence they'll sign up to your list
YOU1000000043_S0000115	so that is why i'm including bonus number two all about ah how to write those killer headlines
YOU1000000043_S0000116	ah so there we go that is that ah you can change this logo thing here you can change the button ah even the color of it
YOU1000000043_S0000117	so you have a lot of options you can ah add a delay so ah your popup isn't shown immediately when people open the page but after a few seconds
YOU1000000043_S0000118	so i can say like five seconds for example you can say ah just show up at the bottom left corner the bottom right corner
YOU1000000043_S0000119	or ah the top left or the top right as well so that is like on the page if you have the whole page
YOU1000000043_S0000120	then it can like pop up here or can pop up here or can pop up from the top like that um so that is how that works
YOU1000000043_S0000121	ah you want to the close button to show or not background settings so this is white right now but you can make it any color really and then it's like that really ugly
YOU1000000043_S0000122	ah so let's leave it white so form email address callback u r l so this would be your thank you page so this is another opportunity to make money with this
YOU1000000043_S0000123	so when people enter their email address and they opt in then you can send them directly to an affiliate offer so that's another opportunity for you to make money with this
YOU1000000043_S0000124	you can put in an affiliate ah affiliate link right here and then people are going to see that offer right after they enter ah their email address and sign up to your list
YOU1000000043_S0000125	so that is another way you can ah okay then auto responder this is where you would connect your aweber or getresponses count
YOU1000000043_S0000126	so let me set that up so let me save this i don't know if i can no because i have to give it a title so ah title test one
YOU1000000043_S0000128	save
YOU1000000043_S0000130	okay now i go to auto responders so you can see test a r aweber so i can change that i can add my own
YOU1000000043_S0000132	auto responder
YOU1000000043_S0000134	so here i could ah select a different list okay now it's gonna go to aweber and get me to sign in i don't actually have an active aweber account cause i am using getresponse right now
YOU1000000043_S0000135	so i hope i can just cancel this no i can't go to my overlays okay here we go
YOU1000000043_S0000136	so this is where you would normally ah log in to your getresponse or aweber account
YOU1000000043_S0000137	give ah sociible permission to use that account so that they can add their email the email addresses of all the people who sign up on that pop up to your own auto responder lists
YOU1000000043_S0000138	now in addition to that as i said you can also add amazon products
YOU1000000043_S0000139	so here for example ah you can add it an iphone and then you can have a pop up showing that iphone as a product
YOU1000000043_S0000140	so if you don't wanna build your list you don't wanna have your own website you don't wanna do anything yourself
YOU1000000043_S0000141	you just wanna like sent people to ah different pieces of content on on social media
YOU1000000043_S0000142	and then give them different amazon offers as ah as your affiliate promotions you can do that with this software as well that may make you some quick money
YOU1000000043_S0000143	it's not gonna be a super profitable long term business but it could definitely make you some quick cash with this
YOU1000000043_S0000144	so if you just want to quicky make your investment into sociible back
YOU1000000043_S0000145	then ah just putting out a ton of different content with amazon pop ups could be a great way to immediately make some money with amazon affiliate marketing
YOU1000000043_S0000146	so those are the different ah options for overlays and that is basically how this works
YOU1000000043_S0000148	so don't we have the different posting campaigns um i'm not sure i can do this right now okay yes maybe i can so test
YOU1000000043_S0000150	ah post to here bucket posting from this bucket per day one
YOU1000000043_S0000152	unable overlay so that i can choose which overlay
YOU1000000043_S0000154	pop up give away opt in sure posting times ah okay so now i don't even know what timezone this is in so i'm gonna say all the time but
YOU1000000043_S0000156	i don't know if this gonna post directly though so i let me just double check that on facebook opening this page
YOU1000000043_S0000158	to see if it already posted something but i think this is gonna post like once a day so probably not gonna happen immediately
YOU1000000043_S0000160	so this is the page i added and oh it did okay cool so i posted that article that i just grabbed from c n n
YOU1000000043_S0000161	ah um it doesn't actually have an image because i had to add my own image because it couldn't grab the image from c n n but you can see it did post this
YOU1000000043_S0000162	now this link is not the actual link to c n n it is a link to sociible and here it should show the article on c n n
YOU1000000043_S0000163	ah but it seems that this one no longer exists for some reason that's a bit weird but it does go to the c n n website as you can see
YOU1000000043_S0000164	and ah over here we now have the pop up the overlay that we created showing up
YOU1000000043_S0000165	so this is not the one i created just now this is another one just i picked from the list of overlays available and you can see free report lah lah lah and then you can sign up here
YOU1000000043_S0000166	and then you can click on send me report but you can also close this and then you would have access to this content and you can just go to home ah
YOU1000000043_S0000168	i don't know why that doesn't work c n n style here we go
YOU1000000043_S0000170	seems the c n n website is not really working while inside an i-frame so that's probably not the best of the best websites to work ah to use with sociible
YOU1000000043_S0000171	but if we grab any of the other articles ah i don't know if i can get a link from the other ones
YOU1000000043_S0000173	can i see a preview somewhere you see
YOU1000000043_S0000175	this is one of those bar previews
YOU1000000043_S0000176	here we go view yes this is possible okay
YOU1000000043_S0000178	so that's another example okay but this goes directly to the article on men's health as you can see ah men's journal in this case
YOU1000000043_S0000179	so it doesn't show the sociible pop up unless it is being posted on social media like this so ah i can't show you an example of another website right now
YOU1000000043_S0000180	ah so let's ignore that and go back to the software so that is the last thing
YOU1000000043_S0000181	ah the campaigns is basically where you set up when the article is posted when the articles are posted on social media what accounts are posted to
YOU1000000043_S0000182	ah i can't add any more as well because it's on pause right now as i said
YOU1000000043_S0000183	so here we go target account ah which accounts which ah do you want buckets or single articles
YOU1000000043_S0000184	ah and do you want a certain amount of posts per day or per week or per month
YOU1000000043_S0000185	so i can say i want ten posts per day and it just keeps posting ten times a day ah and then you can say which times does it post that do you want to enable overlays
YOU1000000043_S0000186	then you choose ah which overlay u r l type there's only one option default so i guess that's just what you choose
YOU1000000043_S0000187	then ah post with overlay so how many of your posts do to have those overlays
YOU1000000043_S0000188	so you can say like i don't want to spam people with those pop ups all the time so i also want to have some relevant content without any promotions
YOU1000000043_S0000189	so i can just show the pop ups on fifty percent of my posts
YOU1000000043_S0000190	and then you can choose which overlay to use so you can add several so then it rotates between those different overlays that you set up
YOU1000000043_S0000191	so those are the options and then you can just post that so that is how you can get the actual program to start
YOU1000000043_S0000192	and then it just automatically work so you don't have to do any thing any more after that it just keeps posting content to your facebook or twitter accounts or both in case you've set up
YOU1000000043_S0000194	as i said a group of accounts and it will have ah all these different articles that it plucks from all these different content websites obviously not c n n because that one doesn't work so well
YOU1000000043_S0000195	but any other content website ah that does work well i'm assuming that the content streams that actually automatically get content they use website where it works flawlessly
YOU1000000043_S0000196	it's just that the c n n website seems to block ah overlays on their own website
YOU1000000043_S0000198	and then of course it puts ah pulls all that different content and then post it on your social media
YOU1000000043_S0000199	and then when people click on those different links they will be presented with your pop ups with your overlays
YOU1000000043_S0000200	ah so they they can sign up to your list or go to your affiliate offers and you directly make money with that content
YOU1000000043_S0000201	so this is how you can use sociible to basically automatic automatically drive free traffic targeted traffic to your offers
YOU1000000043_S0000202	now obviously you will need ah a following on those social media which is bare bonus number one
YOU1000000043_S0000203	that i'm including comes in really handy because that will allow you to add tons and tons of targeted buyer followers on facebook to your groups to your pages or ah to your friends list
YOU1000000043_S0000204	and then they will be the people who see those posts that your sociible is making on autopilot and then you're going to have tons and tons of targeted traffic to your offers
YOU1000000043_S0000205	so that is sociible and how it works let's have a quick look at the sales page where did i put it over here
YOU1000000043_S0000206	so are you finally ready for a reliable and automated way to profit from the social giants
YOU1000000043_S0000207	ah new web app creates fully automated social marketing campaigns in minutes by leveraging other peoples authority content for unlimited hands-free traffic leads and profit in any niche
YOU1000000043_S0000208	without having to pay for ads without any s e o without needing a website or hosting and it's a simple as create schedule profit
YOU1000000043_S0000209	so as you saw that it ah didn't require my own website because i was basically using others other websites to ah get the content
YOU1000000043_S0000210	i also didn't need any s e o obviously because that would only be required when you have your own website
YOU1000000043_S0000211	you don't have to pay for ads as you can just post this on a free organic social media accounts
YOU1000000043_S0000213	so yeah this this is all pretty ah pretty legit stuff
YOU1000000043_S0000214	um so getting unlimited leads and profit obviously will require um you to have a target that following as i mentioned before
YOU1000000043_S0000215	but then bonus number one is gonna help you with that so generate massive traffic leads and sales in any niche from social dot giants on complete autopilot
YOU1000000043_S0000217	so here you see connect your desired social accounts input your target keywords you'd like content for and set up your content stream et cetera
YOU1000000043_S0000218	so i'm not gonna go through the rest of the whole sale page it's very long what i suggested you do if you want to check it out just click on the link and description below this video then click on any of the green buttons over here
YOU1000000043_S0000219	and that will take you to the sales page and you can have a look at the rest of it yourself at your own pace in your own time
YOU1000000043_S0000220	and read through all of these different content about this software and also see a few more examples of how this works really really well with the software
YOU1000000043_S0000222	so let's have a look at the pricing so these are the two different options for initial purchase sociible light and sociible pro those are the two options
YOU1000000043_S0000223	these are not going to be eighty-seven or ninety-seven dollars those are going to be the prices after the launch
YOU1000000043_S0000224	so the launch is gonna start today the eleventh of december twenty eighteen at eleven a m e s t
YOU1000000043_S0000225	that is when the price will be at its possible lowest point twenty-seven or thirty-seven dollars offered a light or the pro version
YOU1000000043_S0000226	so the differences are light is limited to facebook only so no twitter on light
YOU1000000043_S0000227	you can get ad to facebook pages have a total of five campaigns and five content streams per month
YOU1000000043_S0000228	with pro you get both facebook and twitter you get ten pages ten twitter accounts twenty campaigns and a total of twenty content streams per month
YOU1000000043_S0000229	so that is a lot more with pro and it's only ten bucks more so is probably a good idea to grab pro if you wanna get a lot of traffic from this method
YOU1000000043_S0000230	then if you want unlimited pages twitter accounts unlimited postings and unlimited content streams you're gonna need to buy upgrade number one now
YOU1000000043_S0000231	upgrade number one is the unlimited agency license for ah sociible you can choose either a monthly payment of thirty-seven dollars or a quarterly payment of forty-seven dollars
YOU1000000043_S0000232	now considering that gives you three months for only ten bucks more it doesn't really make any sense to get the monthly payments because you end up paying almost three times as much
YOU1000000043_S0000233	so make sure you get the quarterly for forty-seven dollars and you'll also be able to set this up for your clients
YOU1000000043_S0000234	so if you are an agency if you ah do digital marketing for clients then you can use sociible to drive traffic to their offers so you can offer this as a service
YOU1000000043_S0000235	and then it doesn't matter anymore that you're paying forty-seven dollars per quarter for this cause you can charge your clients like a hundred bucks a month
YOU1000000043_S0000236	and even with just one client you'll be able to charge three-hundred bucks per quarter and you're only paying forty-seven to offer him this service this makes this a really really good deal
YOU1000000043_S0000237	that sociible rebrand is upgrade number two that is ninety-seven dollars this allows you to rebrand your campaign with custom domains
YOU1000000043_S0000238	and this is a for those of you who want to sell this as a service especially so that it ah you you can use your own agency's domain
YOU1000000043_S0000239	and then it looks like you're offering the service and it's not just some service from sociible that you're reselling
YOU1000000043_S0000240	because then your clients might just go to sociible directly and skip you as an intermediary
YOU1000000043_S0000241	so if you're gonna do that you can basically rebrand sociible give it any name you want or the name of your own agency and that is a one time payment of ninety-seven dollars allow you that function
YOU1000000043_S0000242	then overlay template bundle ah unlocks ah a lot of extended template so you saw inside sociible it had a couple of different templates for these overlays
YOU1000000043_S0000243	now if you want a tone more overlays then for sixty-seven dollars you can pick up o t o number three that gives you a lot more templates for your overlays
YOU1000000043_S0000244	and that's only a one time payment as well so that is a great deal as well
YOU1000000043_S0000245	so as i said when you do purchase any of those upgrades you will get my full affiliate marketing course affiliation on top as an extra bonus
YOU1000000043_S0000246	but if you purchase sociible whether you purchase the light or pro version these five bonuses that i mentioned before will be waiting for you in your j v zoo account for free

YOU1000000045_S0000025	you know sometimes people say to us you know do you know you look just like hillary clinton and i say yeah i've heard that
YOU1000000045_S0000026	let me um say first of all congratulations on a phenomenal book i didn't know what to expect the book of gutsy women
YOU1000000045_S0000027	i didn't know it was gonna be a book about american women a book about political women but it it's just a book about women who have changed not just their world but the world in some way shape or form
YOU1000000045_S0000028	what's interesting is that you wrote it together you've written many books separately but this was your first book writing together as mother and daughter
YOU1000000045_S0000029	for someone who's written a book without my mother i can't imagine what are we like to write something with my mother
YOU1000000045_S0000030	how do you how do you not to hate each other at this point what is the process like
YOU1000000045_S0000031	ah it was a lot of fun ah it also they did take some adjustment ah because ah my mother still writes longhand
YOU1000000045_S0000032	like like write out the words
YOU1000000045_S0000033	i said in this event i can see ah like a teenager up in the rafters turned to his mother and say what's longhand
YOU1000000045_S0000035	'cause this is the generation that goes what is that writing the words out with a pen and no auto correct
YOU1000000045_S0000036	no and like no ability to track changes or have comment boxes
YOU1000000045_S0000037	and you're doing it like are you doing it on a computer
YOU1000000045_S0000038	yes like twenty-nineteen
YOU1000000045_S0000039	how do you so how do you compare the notes then when when you like do you do do you bring the longhand into the digital or do do you like give it to her and be like you longhand my work
YOU1000000045_S0000040	well so my mother would take photographs of like each page and then text or email me the photographs of the page yeah so
YOU1000000045_S0000041	like when we were particularly working on the things that we wrote together like we write about rosa parks and claudette colvin together
YOU1000000045_S0000042	so i would like type up my claudette colvin essay and send it to her as an attachment like a word document
YOU1000000045_S0000043	and she would take pictures of like each individual page of her rosa parks essay and like send me like page one
YOU1000000045_S0000044	i can feel your frustration as you telling me the story this this is nuts i can i can feel that
YOU1000000045_S0000045	um why did you choose to write this book together i mean you've had many opportunities you could have written about anything your family politics your life
YOU1000000045_S0000046	but this is a specific book and it feels like for specific time why
YOU1000000045_S0000048	because we really believed that ah in today's world ah the stories of gutsy women and literally there are many millions of them
YOU1000000045_S0000049	but we chose a-hundred-and-three ah to write about
YOU1000000045_S0000050	ah because their stories tell us yes about the struggles that they endured
YOU1000000045_S0000051	and their persistence to try to improve their own lives and lives of people around them
YOU1000000045_S0000052	but i think especially in today's world we need to be reminded of these kinds of stories ah and they are historic and contemporary and even a few fictional
YOU1000000045_S0000053	and they were women who inspired me as a little girl and then throughout my life and the same with chelsea and
YOU1000000045_S0000054	in fact we started talking about you know inspirational women when she was a little girl
YOU1000000045_S0000055	and so we want to share these stories and we hope that people can find some um some message ah that will help them
YOU1000000045_S0000056	right
YOU1000000045_S0000057	especially you know given the difficulties that a lot of a lot of people around the world face right now
YOU1000000045_S0000058	it's interesting chelsea because you you've said you know there was a time in your life when you watched your mom running for president and there were more women in space than running for president
YOU1000000045_S0000059	two
YOU1000000045_S0000060	rights and now you you have a plethora women i mean you have six in the race and you've seen how many women participated in in the midterms and won as well
YOU1000000045_S0000061	do you feel like we're noticing a shift in society that's positively moving us to a place where there's equality not there yet but just moving us in that direction
YOU1000000045_S0000062	i think we're absolutely making progress i also really appreciate how you frame the question trevor because it's super important that we don't get complacent
YOU1000000045_S0000063	and that we also understand still how far we have to go
YOU1000000045_S0000064	i mean even though he had an unprecedented number of women ran for congress in twenty-eighteen we were still less than a quarter of all declared candidates
YOU1000000045_S0000065	wow
YOU1000000045_S0000066	so making progress but we still have a long ways to go to get to parity but as we've seen like who runs for office really matters cause it determines who holds office
YOU1000000045_S0000067	and i'm so thrilled that my children are growing up with the most diverse congress in american history
YOU1000000045_S0000068	you have chosen a-hundred-and-three women in this book who all have different stories of being gutsy but what would you find was the common thread that made them who they are
YOU1000000045_S0000069	one i think the sense of just deep purpose sometime something that they knew from when they were little girl
YOU1000000045_S0000070	like jane goodall always knew she wanted to work with animals and sally ride you know the first american woman in space
YOU1000000045_S0000071	um really became a physicist because she wasn't a good enough tennis player so she can found her passion later in life
YOU1000000045_S0000072	but what is so distinctive that all these women is that they brought others along with them
YOU1000000045_S0000073	sometimes consciously breaking down barriers and sometimes just really aware of their example
YOU1000000045_S0000074	and i find that really powerful and gutsy that it wasn't just for themselves it was for others too
YOU1000000045_S0000075	hillary i have to ask you a question that is been plaguing me for a while how did you kill jeffrey epstein
YOU1000000045_S0000077	because you you you're not in power but you have all the power
YOU1000000045_S0000079	i i really need to understand how you do what you do
YOU1000000045_S0000080	because you seem to be behind everything nefarious and yet you do not use it to become president what is the game plan
YOU1000000045_S0000082	well trevor
YOU1000000045_S0000084	what does it but honestly what does it feel like being the bogeyman of the rights
YOU1000000045_S0000085	ah well ah it's it's a constant surprise to me
YOU1000000045_S0000086	because the things they say and now of course it's on steroids with ah being online
YOU1000000045_S0000087	ah are so ridiculous ah beyond any imagination than i could have
YOU1000000045_S0000088	and yet they are so persistent in putting forth these crazy ah ideas and theories
YOU1000000045_S0000089	honestly i don't know what i ever did to get them so upset
YOU1000000045_S0000090	um but a lot of them live to come up with these conspiracy ah theories
YOU1000000045_S0000091	and you know i've gotten kind of used to it it's been going on for a number of years
YOU1000000045_S0000092	have you have you ever thought of just like meeting someone who says hillary you did this and just looking at them being like yes i did
YOU1000000045_S0000094	i mean there there must be right at some point it it becomes so ludicrous and become so extreme
YOU1000000045_S0000095	well i've had i've had i've had encounters like that and and many of my friends have had because
YOU1000000045_S0000096	wow
YOU1000000045_S0000097	yeah they've called up people to urge them to like vote for me
YOU1000000045_S0000098	or they've knocked on a door and somebody will say oh i couldn't do that because and then they launch into one of their big conspiracies
YOU1000000045_S0000099	and i had one friend one very dear friend who i literally have known my entire life and she said she listened to this ridiculous ah conspiracy about me
YOU1000000045_S0000100	and she said you know i've known her since we were in sixth grade and none of that is true and this man looked at her and said but i saw it on the internet
YOU1000000045_S0000102	well i also think it's because it is effective like i'll never forget reading an article after the twenty-sixteen election
YOU1000000045_S0000103	where the reporter interviewed someone who had been an undecided voter
YOU1000000045_S0000104	and he said you know he thought my mom had won all three debates she clearly had a greater command of the subject matter and yet he just kept reading that she had murdered more than fifty people
YOU1000000045_S0000105	and he said somewhat nonchalantly like i don't think that she murdered fifty but like what if she murdered two
YOU1000000045_S0000106	and so you just think it's this like constant erosion of of truth and sanity
YOU1000000045_S0000107	right
YOU1000000045_S0000108	but my favorite and the one that i do secretly hope may be true is that my mother apparently adopted an alien in nineteen-ninety-three and i've always wanted sibling
YOU1000000045_S0000109	so i hope maybe maybe that one will prove after some point
YOU1000000045_S0000110	trevor it it's you have to laugh at because it's so crazy but on the other hand we face a serious problem
YOU1000000045_S0000111	ah a lot of these falsehoods and these crazy stories are taking on lives of their own
YOU1000000045_S0000112	not about me but about everybody particularly anybody in the public arena
YOU1000000045_S0000113	and i have been um very outspoken about the decision by facebook to allow truly false political ads to be run
YOU1000000045_S0000114	i want to applaud twitter for announcing they were not going to let that ah go forward and i hope ah i really hope facebook changes their mind
YOU1000000045_S0000115	because more than half the people in america get their news from facebook and you i mean that's
YOU1000000045_S0000116	well but no but facebook but facebook is is is a real issue and we are living in a world where people no longer know what truth is and don't even agree on which which seems to be a larger issue
YOU1000000045_S0000117	you've witnessed the change in politics through many different times
YOU1000000045_S0000118	ah in fact we're in an interesting period now where the country is gearing up for impeachment
YOU1000000045_S0000119	and you are in an interesting position where in your life you have been literally a part of every single impeachment in some way shape or form
YOU1000000045_S0000120	you had the watergate investigations that you were a part of you then had your husband who was impeached and now your political opponents is getting impeachment
YOU1000000045_S0000121	do you have the impeachment touch is just like a thing
YOU1000000045_S0000122	you know um i wasn't part of andrew johnson but you know other other than that ah
YOU1000000045_S0000123	it it is at a strange perspective to have um because i was a young lawyer ah investigating richard nixon
YOU1000000045_S0000124	and i am very pleased that the house today is proceeding in such a deliberative manner ah they had that vote ah today about the procedures
YOU1000000045_S0000125	because that's what happened in nineteen-seventy-four at first the american people looked at the idea that nixon would be impeached after he won a massive landslide in nineteen-seventy-two
YOU1000000045_S0000126	and they thought that that doesn't make any sense but as the evidence came out and we were literally working eighteen hours a day
YOU1000000045_S0000127	compiling evidence making you know the legal ah arguments the constitutional arguments
YOU1000000045_S0000128	and finally people realize that
YOU1000000045_S0000129	yeah obstruction of justice abusive of power contempt of congress are not what we want to turn a blind eye to in our country
YOU1000000045_S0000130	we need checks and balances it's one of the reasons why the rule of law is at the core of our democracy
YOU1000000045_S0000131	so i know the difference ah about how the house's power is supposed to work
YOU1000000045_S0000132	'cause i was part of seeing it work ah i believe in the right way one of the people we profile is barbara jordan
YOU1000000045_S0000133	who if you go to youtube you can see her ah speech when she voted on the articles of impeachment in nineteen-seventy-four with her defense of the constitution
YOU1000000045_S0000134	and so i'm hoping that now that this is going to move toward public hearings
YOU1000000045_S0000135	where people can see these witnesses in person they can be like a juror themselves trying to decide
YOU1000000045_S0000136	ah that ah the american people will you know make a very ah careful study of what they're being told
YOU1000000045_S0000137	because the founders put impeachment in the constitution for a reason
YOU1000000045_S0000138	ah we have elections but in between elections if there's behavior that is undermining our country endangering our national security
YOU1000000045_S0000139	as the allegations here are ah it's an extraordinary remedy but one that has to be exercised in a sober careful way
YOU1000000045_S0000140	it's interesting because americas is a place where it feels like this process and procedure will be tested more than ever before because of how partisan america has become
YOU1000000045_S0000141	because of how you know toxic politics in america has become
YOU1000000045_S0000142	and i i was interested chelsea because i've noticed a lot of people have asked you why you aren't running for an open seat in chappaqua
YOU1000000045_S0000143	you are a resident of new york state there is a seat that is open and you have the ability to take that seat in many people's opinion
YOU1000000045_S0000144	and you've often said no there is other young people who could take that everyone said yes but you would definitely you know take that seat and you would run with that and you've said you are interested in changing people's lives
YOU1000000045_S0000145	do you have a hesitancy to engage in politics because of how your mom has been treated in her life
YOU1000000045_S0000146	no ah because i see her get up every day and still engage
YOU1000000045_S0000147	and so for me the decision to not even think about kinda running for
YOU1000000045_S0000148	the seat that congresswoman nita lowey will leave ah at the end of next year
YOU1000000045_S0000149	is more about an affirmation of what i'm doing now
YOU1000000045_S0000150	um and i'm thrilled that there are already so many people who have thrown their hats into the ring
YOU1000000045_S0000151	and i hope that young people don't kinda see the toxicity in this moment and turn away from it i hope they see it and say i want to change that
YOU1000000045_S0000152	and i want to get back to a place of science and evidence based decisions and respect for democracy and respect for the rule of law
YOU1000000045_S0000153	so i hope people take it up perversely as an opportunity
YOU1000000045_S0000154	right
YOU1000000045_S0000155	um for what must be different and then be part of the change doing that
YOU1000000045_S0000156	you know because it hasn't you know it hasn't always been like that we've had part partisanship from the very beginning
YOU1000000045_S0000157	but there's also been a lot of effort to find common ground so back to the nixon impeachment
YOU1000000045_S0000158	when the articles of impeachment were voted on members of ah the republican party in the congress voted for one or more of them
YOU1000000045_S0000159	so there has been ah many times
YOU1000000045_S0000160	we write about ah margaret chase smith a republican woman senator from maine who was the first member of her party to stand up to joseph mccarthy in the early nineteen-fifties
YOU1000000045_S0000161	so we've had not only people but a consensus around what it is we're trying to protect and cherish
YOU1000000045_S0000162	and so i can hope that maybe there will be enough people who make their decision not on you know protecting the president but protecting the country
YOU1000000045_S0000163	ah either way they end up
YOU1000000045_S0000164	it's interesting because many of the the women you've written about in the book also share one common trait and that is the obstacles they have to overcome
YOU1000000045_S0000165	often included being accused of things or being scrutinized in a way that was not similar to the men around them to their male counterparts
YOU1000000045_S0000166	how would you respond to a trump supporter if they took the time to listen to you and said
YOU1000000045_S0000167	hilary i don't think it's fair that trump is gonna be impeached for getting information from ukraine
YOU1000000045_S0000168	when your team engaged in russian information through ah you know the co the the team that worked on that side on the steele dossier
YOU1000000045_S0000169	how do you respond to that person when they say you're engaged in foreign information on a political rival trump did the same what is the difference
YOU1000000045_S0000170	there's a huge difference ah you know if you look at the power that the president holds
YOU1000000045_S0000171	the president is in a position to use american leverage and credibility to achieve the goals of our nation
YOU1000000045_S0000172	so i could imagine no i could imagine a conversation where a president would say to the president of ukraine
YOU1000000045_S0000173	you're new at the job one of the things that has held you back is corruption we want to help you fight corruption
YOU1000000045_S0000174	but we want evidence that you are really dedicated to fighting corruption if that's all that had been said
YOU1000000045_S0000175	there's nothing wrong with that
YOU1000000045_S0000176	as secretary of state i used to go and visit leaders and say you know one of your biggest problems is you've got rampant corruption
YOU1000000045_S0000177	it's in your family it's in your people around you you've got to deal with it
YOU1000000045_S0000178	but that's not what happened and we now have not only the whistle blower and the alleged incomplete transcript
YOU1000000045_S0000179	we now have a lot of witnesses who are all saying this was about helping the president himself
YOU1000000045_S0000180	he is acting as the president he's not a political candidate he is not a private citizen he's the president
YOU1000000045_S0000181	now works for the united states
YOU1000000045_S0000182	he works for the united states and we don't want to squander our credibility
YOU1000000045_S0000183	so if other countries see this as they clearly are
YOU1000000045_S0000184	that this president really could care less about ukraine could care less whether it becomes a stable country could care less whether it's able to defend itself against russia
YOU1000000045_S0000185	all he wants is for them to manufacture some kind of damaging information
YOU1000000045_S0000186	about the person he thinks is his likely opponent joe biden
YOU1000000045_S0000187	so there's a huge difference i mean people can gather you know information in you know all kinds of different ways
YOU1000000045_S0000188	but when you combine it with that quid pro quo that existed ah in that conversation which has now been verified repeatedly
YOU1000000045_S0000189	by people who were in the room people who were under pressure
YOU1000000045_S0000190	to deprive the ukrainians of military aid so they could defend themselves there's an active war going on in eastern ukraine
YOU1000000045_S0000191	the russians and their proxies are still killing ukrainians and so
YOU1000000045_S0000192	what this president is basically done is i don't care i don't care about any that i just need some dirt
YOU1000000045_S0000193	and i don't care if you make it up you know in order to get military aid you've got to give me something on joe biden and his son
YOU1000000045_S0000194	it really does seem like trump has taken ah ah unconventional ah approach to say the least in international affairs
YOU1000000045_S0000195	he has been very explicit in saying it's america first and that's all i care about syria has been an interesting case
YOU1000000045_S0000196	and and as a former secretary you have the ability to speak to this with ah depth knowledge
YOU1000000045_S0000197	trumps said i pull the troops out because it's time for america to leave these endless wars everyone spoke out against trump for doing this
YOU1000000045_S0000198	but it was one of your former ambassadors robert ford who said at one point that the alliance with the kurds was never meant to be permanent
YOU1000000045_S0000199	it was just meant to be a temporary coming together because both sides wanted to beat isis and they want allies of all time what do you think is the more correct approach then
YOU1000000045_S0000200	look i i don't think his real philosophy is america first i think it's trump first and he judges everything as to how it will help him
YOU1000000045_S0000201	and perhaps he impulsively decided that bringing our troops home um was good for him politically
YOU1000000045_S0000202	and that seems to be how he is justifying it
YOU1000000045_S0000203	but let's assume we had ah a president who ah was interested in achieving that goal in a defensible way
YOU1000000045_S0000204	here's what could have happened he could have very well have said to the people who know something about syria the kurds the turks and others
YOU1000000045_S0000205	and said you know we need to start a process ah in order to figure out how we can protect the kurds who have been our allies
YOU1000000045_S0000206	maybe not for all time
YOU1000000045_S0000207	but they sure have been sacrificing um on behalf of our objective to drive the islamic state out of syria
YOU1000000045_S0000208	and we know they are holding tens of thousands of prisoners ah for us so let's not leave them ah to their fates
YOU1000000045_S0000209	let's figure out how we work with the turks who are worried about their border let's see how we work with the kurds let's use the leverage we have
YOU1000000045_S0000210	because we still have troops that are special forces who are working ah alongside the kurds and let's figure out how we're gonna make this happen
YOU1000000045_S0000211	instead of just waking up and walking to the south lawn of the white house and say we're bringing all our troops home and i've talked to president erdogan
YOU1000000045_S0000212	and since we don't know what he says on these calls for all we know it could be hey ah you know ah president erdogan ah we're gonna take that our troops out what you have on joe biden
YOU1000000045_S0000213	we don't know
YOU1000000045_S0000214	right
YOU1000000045_S0000215	and that's what's so frightening about what's happening
YOU1000000045_S0000216	because he has an affinity for dictators ah he's clearly misjudged ah the north koreans ah
YOU1000000045_S0000217	kim jong-un has been firing missiles and obviously not ah behaving the way that a meeting with the president should have ah led him to
YOU1000000045_S0000218	he clearly does putin's bidding i mean putin could not be happier to have the ukrainians caught up in this
YOU1000000045_S0000219	while he continues to you know eat away at their country and their sovereignty
YOU1000000045_S0000220	the russians have a huge amount of influence now in the middle east
YOU1000000045_S0000221	because they are right there in ah syria alongside the iranians and propping up the assad government
YOU1000000045_S0000222	so there's a lot of moving pieces on this complex chessboard
YOU1000000045_S0000223	and i've been in a white house ah situation room where the president was demanding information
YOU1000000045_S0000224	not acting on impulse where we were running through different scenarios where we had to be constantly testing our opinions against others
YOU1000000045_S0000225	in order to give the president the best advice that is not happening in this white house
YOU1000000045_S0000226	it is unfortunately ah unpredictable about what he will do next
YOU1000000045_S0000227	so therefore other countries particularly ones adversarial to us
YOU1000000045_S0000228	are going around the world saying you can't you can't count on america anymore you know count on us
YOU1000000045_S0000229	we will sell you arms not the americans we will make deals with you not the americans we will have investments in your country not the americans
YOU1000000045_S0000230	and it's a tragedy
YOU1000000045_S0000231	because um i think we were really well positioned at the end of the obama administration to keep building on our leadership
YOU1000000045_S0000232	but i think that's been ah squandered under this president
YOU1000000045_S0000233	let me ask you one question before we wrap it up the book of gutsy women talks about women who have done something amazing throughout time
YOU1000000045_S0000234	one thing that we can't deny has changed throughout time has been politics and the way we see the world
YOU1000000045_S0000235	i've always been fascinated as to your relationship you know you are you are your mother's daughter yes
YOU1000000045_S0000236	but you are younger than her are there ever political ideas or you know the conversations you have where you don't agree or you've changed how you see an idea because of your age difference
YOU1000000045_S0000237	yes
YOU1000000045_S0000238	yes absolutely i think ah most notably on gay marriage and equal marriage rights
YOU1000000045_S0000239	ah which is something that we talked about extensively
YOU1000000045_S0000240	wow
YOU1000000045_S0000241	um throughout years and
YOU1000000045_S0000242	i'm really grateful and proud of my mom for her shift to being just a dogged determined not only supporter but advocate for equal marriage rights
YOU1000000045_S0000243	so you were like in the house and you were like mom got to get gay rights going come on
YOU1000000045_S0000244	like a weird fight to be having with your mom i'm not cause like i was like i wan to go to a party and you were like mom gay people need to get married
YOU1000000045_S0000245	go to your room young lady that's pretty wild
YOU1000000045_S0000247	i mean yes but hopefully in a nicer tone
YOU1000000045_S0000248	but chelsea was you know really one of the strong ah voices on behalf of ah gay marriage here in new york
YOU1000000045_S0000249	um she you know gave lots of speeches she was part of a group of leaders that we're advocating for it
YOU1000000045_S0000250	and you know i really respect ah and listened to her about all kinds of things
YOU1000000045_S0000251	and this was something that ah made a lot of sense to me especially because she has such passion about it
YOU1000000045_S0000252	well i'll tell you this it is a book of gutsy women written by two of the gutsiest thank you so much for being on the show wonderful having you here

YOU1000000101_S0000011	i believe that the issues confronting us cross party lines
YOU1000000101_S0000013	now one side in this campaign has been telling us that the issues of this election are the maintenance of peace and prosperity the line has been used we have never had it so good
YOU1000000101_S0000014	but i have an uncomfortable feeling that this prosperity isn't something on which we can base our hopes for the future
YOU1000000101_S0000015	no nation in history has ever survived the tax burden that reach the third of its national income
YOU1000000101_S0000016	today thirty-seven cents out of every dollar earned in this country is the tax collector share
YOU1000000101_S0000017	and yet our government continues to spend seventeen million dollars a day more than the government takes in
YOU1000000101_S0000018	we haven't balanced our budget twenty-eight out of the last thirty-four years we've raised our debt limit three times in the last twelve months
YOU1000000101_S0000019	and now our national debt is one and a half times bigger than all the combined debts of all the nations of the world
YOU1000000101_S0000020	we have fifteen billion dollars in gold in our treasury we don't own an ounce foreign dollar claims are twenty-seven point three billion dollars
YOU1000000101_S0000021	and we've just had announced that the dollar of nineteen thirty-nine will now purchase forty-five cents in its total value
YOU1000000101_S0000022	as for the peace that we would preserve
YOU1000000101_S0000023	i wonder who among us would like to approach the wife or mother whose husband or son has died in south vietnam and ask them if they think this is a peace
YOU1000000101_S0000024	that should be maintained indefinitely do they mean peace or do they mean we just wanted to be left in peace
YOU1000000101_S0000025	there can be no real peace while one american is dying some place in the world for the rest of us
YOU1000000101_S0000026	we're at war with the most dangerous enemy that has ever faced mankind in his long crime from this swamp to the stars
YOU1000000101_S0000027	and it's been said if we loose that war it didn't so doing loose this way freedom of ours
YOU1000000101_S0000028	history will record with the greatest astonishment of those who had the most to lose did the least to prevent it's happening
YOU1000000101_S0000029	well i think it's time we ask ourselves if we still know the freedoms that were intended for us by the founding fathers
YOU1000000101_S0000030	not too long ago two friends of mine were talking to a cuban refugee a businessman who would escape from castro
YOU1000000101_S0000031	and in the midst of his story one of my friends turned the other and said we don't know how lucky we are and the cuban stopped and said how lucky you are
YOU1000000101_S0000032	i had some place to escape to and in that sentence told us the entire story
YOU1000000101_S0000033	if we lose freedom here there's no place to escape to this is the last stand on earth
YOU1000000101_S0000034	and this idea the government is behold into the people that it has no other source of power except to sovereign people
YOU1000000101_S0000035	is still the newest and the most unique idea in all along history of man's relation to man
YOU1000000101_S0000036	this is the issue of this election
YOU1000000101_S0000037	whether we believe in our capacity for self-government or whether we abandon the american revolution
YOU1000000101_S0000038	and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far distant capital can plan our lives for us better then we can plan them ourselves
YOU1000000101_S0000039	you and i are told increasingly we have to choose between a left or right well i'd like to suggest there is no such thing is a left or right
YOU1000000101_S0000040	there is only an up or down
YOU1000000101_S0000042	man's own old age dream the ultimate and individual freedom consistent with law and order or down to the end heap of the terror terrorism
YOU1000000101_S0000043	and regardless of their sincerity their humanitarian motives those who would trade our freedom for security have embarked on this down with course
YOU1000000101_S0000044	in this vote harvesting time naive is terms like the great society
YOU1000000101_S0000045	or as we were told a few days ago by the president we must accept the greater government activity in the affairs of the people
YOU1000000101_S0000046	but they've been a little more explicit in the past and among themselves at all of the things i know will quote of appeared and print
YOU1000000101_S0000047	these are not republican accusations
YOU1000000101_S0000048	for example they have voices that say the cold war will end through our acceptance of a not undemocratic socialism
YOU1000000101_S0000049	another voice says the profit motive is become outmoded it must be replace by the incentives of the welfare state
YOU1000000101_S0000050	or our traditional system of individual freedom is incapable of solving the complex problems of the twentieth century
YOU1000000101_S0000051	senator fulbright has said his stand for university that the constitution is outmoded
YOU1000000101_S0000052	he referred to the president as our moral teacher and our leader
YOU1000000101_S0000054	and he says he is hobbled in his task by the restrictions of powers imposed on him by this antiquated document
YOU1000000101_S0000055	he must be freed so that he can do for us what he knows is best
YOU1000000101_S0000056	and senator clark of pennsylvania another utriculus spokesman defines liberalism as meeting the material needs of the masses through the full power of centralized government
YOU1000000101_S0000057	well i for one resend it wanna representative of the people refers to you and me the free men and women of this country as the masses
YOU1000000101_S0000058	this is a term we haven't applied to ourselves in america
YOU1000000101_S0000059	but beyond that the full power of centralized government this was the very thing the founding father sought to minimize
YOU1000000101_S0000060	they knew that governments don't control things a government can't control the economy without controlling people
YOU1000000101_S0000061	and they know when a government sets out to do that it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose
YOU1000000101_S0000062	they also knew those founding fathers that outside of its legitimate functions government does nothing as well or as economically as the private sector of the economy
YOU1000000101_S0000063	now we have no better example of this than government's involvement of the farm economy over the last thirty years
YOU1000000101_S0000064	since nineteen fifty-five the cost of this program is nearly doubled one-fourth of farming in america is responsible for eighty-five percent of the farm surplus
YOU1000000101_S0000065	three-fourths of the farming is out on the free market and is known a twenty-one percent increase in the per capita consumption of all its produce
YOU1000000101_S0000066	you see that one-fourth of farming that's regulated and controlled by the federal government
YOU1000000101_S0000067	in the last three years we've spent forty-three dollars in the feed grain program for every dollar bushel of corn we don't grow
YOU1000000101_S0000068	senator humphrey last week charged that barry goldwater as president would seek to eliminate farmers he should do his homework a little better
YOU1000000101_S0000069	because he'll find out that we've had a decline of five million in the farm population under these government programs
YOU1000000101_S0000070	he'll also find that the democratic administration has sought to get from congress
YOU1000000101_S0000071	extension of the farm program to include that three-forth that is now free
YOU1000000101_S0000072	you'll find that they've also asked for the right to imprison farmers who wouldn't keep books as prescribed by the federal government
YOU1000000101_S0000073	the secretary of agriculture asked for the right to seize farms through condemnation and resell them to other individuals
YOU1000000101_S0000074	and contained in that same program was a provision that would have allowed the federal government to remove two million farmers from the soil
YOU1000000101_S0000075	at the same time there has been an increase in the department of agriculture employees there's now one for every thirty farms in the united states
YOU1000000101_S0000076	and still they can't tell us how sixty-six shiploads of grain headed for austria disappeared without a trace and billy solaced has never left sure
YOU1000000101_S0000078	every responsible farmer and farm organization has repeatedly asked the government to free the farm economy
YOU1000000101_S0000079	but how who are farmers to know what's best for them
YOU1000000101_S0000080	the full wheat farmers voted against wheat program the government passed it anyway now the price of bread goes up the price a week to the farmer goes down
YOU1000000101_S0000081	meanwhile back in the city under urban renewably assault on freedom carries on
YOU1000000101_S0000083	private property rights so deluded that publican for just almost anything a few government planners decided it should be in a program that takes from the needy and gives to the greedy
YOU1000000101_S0000084	we see such spectacles as in cleveland ohio a million and a half dollar building completed only three years ago must be destroyed
YOU1000000101_S0000085	to make way for what government officials call a more compatible use of the land
YOU1000000101_S0000086	the president tells us he's now going to start building public housing units in the thousands where heretofore we've only built them in the hundreds
YOU1000000101_S0000087	but f h a and the veterans administration tell us they have a hundred and twenty thousand housing units they've taken back through mortgage foreclosure
YOU1000000101_S0000088	for three decades we've sought to solve the problems of unemployment through government planning and the more the plans fail the more the planners plan
YOU1000000101_S0000089	the latest is the area redevelopment agency
YOU1000000101_S0000090	they've just declared rice county kansas a depressed area
YOU1000000101_S0000091	rice county kansas has two hundred oil wells and the fourteen thousand people there have over thirty million dollars on deposit in personal savings in their banks
YOU1000000101_S0000093	when the government tells you you're depressed lie down and be depressed
YOU1000000101_S0000094	we have so many people who can't see a fat man standing beside a thin man without coming to the conclusion the fat man got that way by taking advantage of the thin one
YOU1000000101_S0000095	so they're going to solve all the problems of human misery through government and government planning
YOU1000000101_S0000096	well now we have government planning and welfare have the answer
YOU1000000101_S0000097	and they'd had almost thirty years of it shouldn't we expect government to read the score to us once in a while
YOU1000000101_S0000098	shouldn't they be telling us about the decline each year in the number of people needing help
YOU1000000101_S0000099	the reduction in the need for public housing but the reverse is true which year the need grows greater the program grows greater
YOU1000000101_S0000101	we were told four years ago that seventeen million people went to bed hungry each night well that was probably true they were all on a diet
YOU1000000101_S0000104	but now we're told that nine point three million families in this country are poverty stricken on the basis of earning less than three thousands dollars a year
YOU1000000101_S0000105	welfare spending ten times greater than it was in the dark depths of the depression
YOU1000000101_S0000106	we're spending forty-five billion dollars on welfare
YOU1000000101_S0000107	now do a little arithmetic and you'll find that if we divided the forty-five billion dollars up equally among those nine million poor families
YOU1000000101_S0000108	we'd be able to give each family forty-six hundred dollars a year and this added to their present income should eliminate poverty
YOU1000000101_S0000110	direct aid to the poor however is only running about six hundred dollars per family it would seem that some place there must be some overhead
YOU1000000101_S0000112	now
YOU1000000101_S0000114	so now we declare war on poverty or you too can be a bobby baker
YOU1000000101_S0000116	how do they honestly expect us to believe that if we add one billion dollars to the forty-five billion we're spending one more program to the thirty odd we have
YOU1000000101_S0000117	and remember this new program doesn't replace any it just duplicates existing programs do they believe that poverty is suddenly going to disappear by magic
YOU1000000101_S0000118	well in all fairness i should explain there is one part of the new program that isn't duplicated this is the youth feature we're now going to solve the dropout problem juvenile delinquency
YOU1000000101_S0000119	by reinstituting something like the old c c c camps and we're going to put our young people in these camps
YOU1000000101_S0000120	but again we do some arithmetic and we find that we're going to spend each year just on room and board for each young person we help forty-seven hundred dollars a year
YOU1000000101_S0000121	we can send them to harvard for twenty-seven hundred
YOU1000000101_S0000123	of course don't get me wrong i'm not suggesting harvard as the answer to juvenile delinquency
YOU1000000101_S0000125	but seriously what are we doing to those we seek to help
YOU1000000101_S0000127	not too long ago a judge called me here in los angeles
YOU1000000101_S0000128	he told me that a young woman who come before him for a divorce
YOU1000000101_S0000129	she had six children was pregnant with her seven under his questioning she revealed her husband was a laborer earning two hundred and fifty dollars a month
YOU1000000101_S0000130	she wanted the divorce to get an eighty-dollar raise she's eligible for three hundred and thirty dollars a month in the aid to dependent children program
YOU1000000101_S0000131	she got the idea from two women in her neighborhood who'd already done that very thing
YOU1000000101_S0000132	yet anytime you and i question the schemes of the do-gooders were denounced as being against their humanitarian goals they say we're always against things we're never for anything
YOU1000000101_S0000133	well the trouble with our liberal friends is not that they're ignorant it's just that they know so much that isn't so now
YOU1000000101_S0000135	we're for a provision the destitution should not follow unemployment by reason of old age and to that end we have accepted social security as a step toward meeting the problem
YOU1000000101_S0000136	but we're against those entrusted with this program when they practice deception regarding its fiscal shortcomings
YOU1000000101_S0000137	when they charge that any criticism of the program means that we want to end payments to those people who depend on them for a livelihood
YOU1000000101_S0000138	they've called it insurance to us in a hundred million pieces of literature but then they appeared before the supreme court and they testified it was a welfare program
YOU1000000101_S0000139	they only use the term insurance to sell it to the people and they said social security dues are a tax for the general use of the government
YOU1000000101_S0000140	and the government has used that tax there is no fund because robert byers the actuarial head appeared before a congressional committee
YOU1000000101_S0000141	and admitted that social security as of this moment is two hundred and ninety-eight billion dollars in the whole
YOU1000000101_S0000142	but he said there should be no cause for worry because as long as they have the power to tax they could always take away from the people whatever they needed to bail them out of trouble
YOU1000000101_S0000143	and they're doing just that a young man twenty-one years of age working at an average salary
YOU1000000101_S0000144	his social security contribution would in the open market buy him an insurance policy that would guarantee two hundred and twenty dollars a month
YOU1000000101_S0000145	at age sixty-five the government promises a one hundred and twenty-seven he could live it up until he's thirty-one and then take out a policy that would pay more than social security
YOU1000000101_S0000146	now are we so lacking in business sense that we can't put this program on a sound basis
YOU1000000101_S0000147	so that people who do require those payments will find they can get them when they're do that the cupboard isn't bare barry goldwater thinks we can
YOU1000000101_S0000148	at the same time can't we introduce voluntary features that would permit a citizen who can do better on his own
YOU1000000101_S0000149	to be excused upon presentation of evidence that he had made provision for the non-earning years
YOU1000000101_S0000150	should we not allow a widow with children to work and not lose the benefits supposedly paid for by her deceased husband
YOU1000000101_S0000151	shouldn't you and i be allowed to declare who our beneficiaries will be under this program which we cannot do
YOU1000000101_S0000152	i think we're for telling our senior citizens that no one in this country should be denied medical care because of a lack of funds
YOU1000000101_S0000154	but i think we're against forcing all citizens regardless of need into a compulsory government program
YOU1000000101_S0000155	especially when we have such examples as was announced last week when france admitted that their medicare program is now bankrupt they've come to the end of the road
YOU1000000101_S0000156	in addition was barry goldwater so irresponsible when he suggested that our government give up its program of deliberate planned inflation
YOU1000000101_S0000157	so that when you do get your social security pension a dollar will buy a dollar's worth and not forty-five cents worth
YOU1000000101_S0000159	i think we're for an international organization where the nations of the world can seek peace
YOU1000000101_S0000160	but i think we're against subordinating american interest to an organization that has become so structurally unsound
YOU1000000101_S0000161	that today you can master a two-thirds vote and the floor of the general assembly among nations that represent less than ten percent of the world's population
YOU1000000101_S0000162	i think we're against the hypocrisy of assailing our allies because here and there they cling to a colony
YOU1000000101_S0000163	while we engage in a conspiracy of silence and never open our mouths about the millions of people enslaved in the soviet colonies in the satellite nations
YOU1000000101_S0000165	i think we're for aiding our allies by sharing of our material blessings with those nations which share in our fundamental beliefs
YOU1000000101_S0000166	but we're against doling out money government to government creating bureaucracy if not socialism all over the world
YOU1000000101_S0000167	we set out to help nineteen countries we're helping a hundred and seven we've spent a hundred and forty-six billion dollars
YOU1000000101_S0000168	with that money we've bought a two million dollar yacht for haile selassie we bought dressed suits for greek undertaker's extra wives for kenya government officials
YOU1000000101_S0000169	we bought a thousand t v sets for a place where they have no electricity
YOU1000000101_S0000171	in the last six years fifty-two nations have bought seven billion dollars worth of our gold and all fifty-two are receiving foreign aid from this country
YOU1000000101_S0000173	no government ever voluntarily reduces itself in size so government programs once launched never disappeared
YOU1000000101_S0000174	actually a government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we'll ever seen on this earth
YOU1000000101_S0000176	federal employees federal employees number two and a half million and federal state and local one out of six of the nation's workforce employed by government
YOU1000000101_S0000177	these proliferating bureaus with their thousands of regulations have cost as many of our constitutional safeguards
YOU1000000101_S0000178	how many of us realized that today federal agents can invade a man's property without a warrant they can impose a fine without a formal hearing let alone a trial by jury
YOU1000000101_S0000179	and they can seize and sell his property at auction to enforce the payment of that fine
YOU1000000101_S0000180	in chico county arkansas james weir over planted his rice allotment the government obtained a seventeen-thousand-dollar judgment
YOU1000000101_S0000181	and a u s marshal sold his nine hundred and sixty acre farm at auction the government said it was necessary as a warning to others to make the system work
YOU1000000101_S0000183	last february nineteenth at the university of minnesota norman thomas six times candidate for president and the socialist party ticket said if barry goldwater became president
YOU1000000101_S0000184	he would stop the advance of socialism in the united states i think that's exactly what he will do
YOU1000000101_S0000186	but as a former democrat i can tell you norman thomas isn't the only man who has drawn this parallel to socialism with the present administration
YOU1000000101_S0000187	because back in nineteen thirty-six mister democrat himself al smith a great american came before the american people
YOU1000000101_S0000188	and charged that the leadership of his party was taking the party of jefferson jackson and cleveland down the road under the banners of marx lenin and stalin
YOU1000000101_S0000189	and he walked away from his party and he never returned to the day he died
YOU1000000101_S0000190	because to this day the leadership of that party has been taking that party that honorable party down the road and the image of the labor socialist party of england
YOU1000000101_S0000191	now it doesn't require expropriation or confiscation of private property or business to impose socialism on our people
YOU1000000101_S0000192	what does it mean whether you hold the deed to the or the title to your business or property if the government holds the power of life and death
YOU1000000101_S0000193	over that business or property and such machinery already exists
YOU1000000101_S0000194	the government can find some charge to bring against any concern it chooses to prosecute every businessman has his own tale of harassment
YOU1000000101_S0000195	somewhere a perversion has taken place our natural unalienable rights are now considered to be a dispensation of government
YOU1000000101_S0000196	and freedom has never been so fragile so close to slipping from our grasp as it is at this moment
YOU1000000101_S0000197	our democratic opponents seem unwilling to debate these issues they wanna make you and i believe that this is a contest between two men
YOU1000000101_S0000198	that we're to choose just between two personalities well what of this man that they would destroy
YOU1000000101_S0000199	and in destroying they would destroy that which he represents the ideas that you and i hold dear
YOU1000000101_S0000201	is he the brash and shallow and trigger-happy man they say he is
YOU1000000101_S0000202	well i've been privileged to know him when i knew him long before he ever dreamed of trying for high office
YOU1000000101_S0000203	and i can tell you personally i've never known a man in my life i believed so incapable of doing a dishonest or dishonorable
YOU1000000101_S0000205	this is a man who in his own business before he headed politics instituted a profit sharing plan before unions had ever thought of it
YOU1000000101_S0000206	he put in health and medical insurance for all his employees he took fifty percent of the profits before taxes
YOU1000000101_S0000207	and set up a retirement program a pension plan for all his employees
YOU1000000101_S0000208	he sent monthly checks for life to an employee was ill and couldn't work he provides nursing care for the children of mothers who work in the stores
YOU1000000101_S0000210	when mexico was ravaged by the floods in the rio grande he climbed in his airplane and flew flew med medicine and supplies down there
YOU1000000101_S0000211	an ex g i told me how he met him
YOU1000000101_S0000212	it was the week before christmas during the korean war and he was at the los angeles airport trying to get a ride home to arizona for christmas
YOU1000000101_S0000214	and he said that a lot of servicemen there and no seats available on the planes
YOU1000000101_S0000215	and then a voice came over the loudspeaker and said any men in uniform wanting a ride to arizona go to runway such and such
YOU1000000101_S0000216	and they went down there there was a fella named barry goldwater sitting in his plane
YOU1000000101_S0000217	everyday in those weeks before christmas all day long he load up the plane fly it to arizona fly them to their homes fly back over to get another load
YOU1000000101_S0000219	during the hectic split-second timing of a campaign this is a man who took time out to sit beside an old friend who was dying of cancer
YOU1000000101_S0000220	his campaign managers were understandably impatient but he said there aren't many left to care what happens to her i'd like her to know i care
YOU1000000101_S0000221	this is a man who said to his nineteen-year-old son there is no foundation like the rock of honesty and fairness
YOU1000000101_S0000222	and when you begin to build your life on that rock with the cement of the faith in god that you have then you have a real start
YOU1000000101_S0000224	this is not a man who could carelessly send other people's sons to war
YOU1000000101_S0000226	and that is the issue of this campaign that makes all the other problems i've discussed academic unless we realize we're in a war that must be won
YOU1000000101_S0000228	those who would trade our freedom for the soup kitchen of the welfare state have told us they have a utopian solution of peace without victory they call their policy accommodation
YOU1000000101_S0000229	and they say if we'll only avoid any direct confrontation with the enemy he'll forget his evil ways and learn to love us
YOU1000000101_S0000230	all who oppose them are indicted as war mongers they say we offer simple answers to complex problems
YOU1000000101_S0000231	but perhaps there is a simple answer not an easy answer but simple if you and i have the courage to tell our elected officials
YOU1000000101_S0000232	that we want our national policy based on what we know in our hearts is morally right we cannot be by our security our freedom from the threat of the bomb
YOU1000000101_S0000234	by committing an immorality so great as saying to a billion human beings now enslave behind the iron curtain give up your dreams of freedom
YOU1000000101_S0000235	because to save our own skins we're willing to make a deal with your slave masters
YOU1000000101_S0000236	alexander hamilton said a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one
YOU1000000101_S0000237	now let's set the record straight there's no argument over the choice between peace and war
YOU1000000101_S0000238	but there's only one guaranteed way you can have peace and you can have it in the next second surrender
YOU1000000101_S0000239	admittedly there's a risk in any course we follow other than this but every lesson of history tells us that the greater risk lies in appeasement
YOU1000000101_S0000240	and this is the specter our well-meaning liberal friends refuse to face that their policy of accommodation is appeasement
YOU1000000101_S0000241	and it gives no choice between peace and war only between fight or surrender
YOU1000000101_S0000242	if we continue to accommodate continue to back and retreat eventually we have to face the final demand the ultimatum and what then
YOU1000000101_S0000243	when the key to khrushchev has told his people he knows what our answer will be
YOU1000000101_S0000244	he has told them that we're retreating under the pressure of the cold war and someday when the time comes to deliver the final ultimatum
YOU1000000101_S0000245	our surrender will be voluntary because by that time we will have been weakened from within spiritually morally and economically
YOU1000000101_S0000246	he believes this because from our side he's heard voices pleading for peace at any price or better red than dead
YOU1000000101_S0000247	or as one commentator put it he'd rather live on his knees than die in his feet and there in lies the road to war because those voices don't speak for the rest of us
YOU1000000101_S0000248	you and i note and do not believe that life is so dear and peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery
YOU1000000101_S0000249	if nothing in life is worth dying for when did this begin just in the face of this enemy or should moses have told the children of israel to live in slavery under the pharaohs
YOU1000000101_S0000251	should christ have refused the cross should the patriots at concord bridge have thrown down their guns and refused to fire the shot heard round the world
YOU1000000101_S0000253	the martyrs of history were not fools and our honored dead who gave their lives to stop the advance of the nazis didn't die in vain
YOU1000000101_S0000255	where then is the road to peace well it's a simple answer after all
YOU1000000101_S0000256	you and i have the courage to say to our enemies there is a price we will not pay there is a point beyond which they must not advance
YOU1000000101_S0000258	and this
YOU1000000101_S0000260	this is the meaning in the phrase of barry goldwater peace through strength
YOU1000000101_S0000261	winston churchill said the destiny of men is not measured by material computations when great forces around the move in the world we learn we're spirits not animals
YOU1000000101_S0000262	and he said there's something going on in time and space and beyond time and space which whether we like it or not spells duty
YOU1000000101_S0000263	you and i have a rendezvous with destiny we'll preserve for our children this the last best hope of man on earth
YOU1000000101_S0000264	or will sentence them to take the last step into a thousand years of darkness
YOU1000000101_S0000265	we will keep in mind and remember that barry goldwater has faith in us he has faith that you and i have the ability and the dignity and the right
YOU1000000101_S0000266	to make our own decisions and determine our own destiny thank you very much

YOU1000000102_S0000003	it now gives me great pleasure to introduce this year's commandment speaker steve jobs
YOU1000000102_S0000005	the chief executive officer and co-founder of apple and pixar animation studios
YOU1000000102_S0000007	stanford university has been characterized since it's founding by willingness to be bold and to strike out new directions
YOU1000000102_S0000008	and this is a characteristic very much shared by today's speaker a pioneer and visionary
YOU1000000102_S0000009	for almost three decades his name and the companies he has founded have been synonymous with innovation and creativity
YOU1000000102_S0000010	as a young boy growing up in los santos steve jobs came of age at the same time as silicon valley

YOU1000000102_S0000014	attract through india and assured strength as a video game designer for atari followed
YOU1000000102_S0000016	soon after his return to the valley in nineteen seventy-four
YOU1000000102_S0000017	he became a regular along with steve wozniak at meetings of the homebrew computer club
YOU1000000102_S0000018	held at the stanford linear accelerator centre it was not long before the two of them had build the prototype for the apple one
YOU1000000102_S0000019	the apple one was very fast at the time reading and writing four kilobytes in about twenty seconds
YOU1000000102_S0000021	about twenty thousand times slower than we do so today
YOU1000000102_S0000023	the apple two was faster still but more importantly introduced color monitors into the home market
YOU1000000102_S0000024	in the mid nineteen eighties the macintosh became the first truly user friendly personal computer
YOU1000000102_S0000025	you didn't have to be an expert to set it up or to load software
YOU1000000102_S0000026	or to transfer information between applications and the mouse offered point and click convenience
YOU1000000102_S0000027	and opened the door to computer literacy for everyone
YOU1000000102_S0000028	i still remember the amazed faces of onlookers
YOU1000000102_S0000029	as they saw a computer that was completely different from the personal computers of that day
YOU1000000102_S0000031	steve also co-founded pixar animation studios which has revolutionized the film industry in it short history with brilliant use of technology
YOU1000000102_S0000032	and produced two academy award winning films toy story and finding nemo
YOU1000000102_S0000034	since his return to apple eight years ago steve has reinvented the company once again extending it's vision to music and new digital media
YOU1000000102_S0000035	i-pod and i-tunes have changed the way we listen to organize store and purchase our music
YOU1000000102_S0000036	and in my case the way i often read books
YOU1000000102_S0000037	now songs we love are just ninety-nine cents and a completely legal click away
YOU1000000102_S0000039	i-photo and i-movie revolutionize the ability of consumers to organize edit and display digital photography and video
YOU1000000102_S0000040	putting capabilities that once cost thousands of dollars into the hands of every mac user
YOU1000000102_S0000041	steve is also widely recognize for his ability to create an innovative environment inside apple as well as as an external company image that is equally innovative
YOU1000000102_S0000042	just think about apple's marketing campaigns over the past three decades a promotional flyer in nineteen seventy-six
YOU1000000102_S0000043	showed isak newton sitting under a tree just as an apple was falling by
YOU1000000102_S0000044	with the catchy exhortation to bite b y t e into an apple
YOU1000000102_S0000046	there was an iconic super bowl commercial
YOU1000000102_S0000048	techy humor
YOU1000000102_S0000050	an iconic super bowl commercial telling us that the macintosh was on the horizon
YOU1000000102_S0000051	and assuring us that we would see why nineteen eight-four wouldn't be like nineteen eight-four
YOU1000000102_S0000052	and in the late nineteen nineties we saw banners and billboards
YOU1000000102_S0000053	featuring pablo picasso albert einstein martha graham and mahatma gandhi all urging us to think different
YOU1000000102_S0000055	steve jobs understands the creativity and innovation start by thinking differently
YOU1000000102_S0000057	he has a deep routed belief in the power of education to transform lives coupled with desire to make the world a better place
YOU1000000102_S0000059	from the earliest days of apple he worked to develop partnerships with educators and get computers into schools
YOU1000000102_S0000061	for almost three decades he and his companies have provided invaluable technology in supports to schools and communities
YOU1000000102_S0000062	increasing accessibility to information for learners of all ages
YOU1000000102_S0000064	more than one hundred years ago in describing his vision for a new university lewan stanford wrote
YOU1000000102_S0000065	the imagination needs to be cultivated and developed to assure success in life
YOU1000000102_S0000067	stanford clearly understood the technical knowledge was only the starting point for creation and discovery
YOU1000000102_S0000068	steve jobs understands that the computer is a very powerful tool in a technical sense
YOU1000000102_S0000069	but that it's true power lies in the ability to unleash the imagination and creativity of the user
YOU1000000102_S0000071	as he explained to the new york times in a nineteen ninety-seven interview the macintosh turned out so well
YOU1000000102_S0000072	because the people working on it were musicians artists poets and historians
YOU1000000102_S0000073	who also happened to be excellent computer scientists
YOU1000000102_S0000075	and last fall a business week reporter asked how he manages for innovation
YOU1000000102_S0000076	his answer was deceptively simple we hire people who want to make the best things in the world
YOU1000000102_S0000078	steve jobs personifies the spirit and creativity that have characterized this university since it's founding one hundred and fourteen years ago
YOU1000000102_S0000079	and we're pleased to have him here today please join me in warmly welcoming this year's commandment speaker steve jobs
YOU1000000102_S0000081	i'm ah honored to be with you today for your commandment for one of the finest universities in the world
YOU1000000102_S0000083	truth be told
YOU1000000102_S0000085	ah i never graduate from college and ah this is the closest i've ever gotten to a college graduation
YOU1000000102_S0000087	today i wanna tell you three stories from my life that's it no big deal just three stories
YOU1000000102_S0000089	the first story is about connecting the docs
YOU1000000102_S0000091	i dropped out of re college after the first six months but then stayed around as a drop in for other eighteen months or so before i really quit
YOU1000000102_S0000093	so why'd i drop out
YOU1000000102_S0000095	it started before i was born
YOU1000000102_S0000097	my biological mother was a young unwed graduate student and she decided to put me up for adoption
YOU1000000102_S0000098	she felt very strongly that i should be adopted by college graduates so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife
YOU1000000102_S0000100	except than when i popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl
YOU1000000102_S0000102	so my parents who were on a waiting list got a call in the middle of the night asking we've got an unexpected baby boy you want him
YOU1000000102_S0000103	they said of course
YOU1000000102_S0000105	my biological mother found out later that my mother had never graduate from college and my father had never graduate from high school
YOU1000000102_S0000106	she refused to sign the final adoption papers
YOU1000000102_S0000108	she only relented a few months later when my parents promised that i would go to college this was the start in my life
YOU1000000102_S0000110	and seventeen years later i did go to college but i naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as stanford
YOU1000000102_S0000111	and all of my working class parents savings were being spent on my college tuition after six months i couldn't see the value in it
YOU1000000102_S0000112	i had no idea what i wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out
YOU1000000102_S0000113	and here i was spending all the money my parents had save their entire life
YOU1000000102_S0000115	so i decided to drop out and trust that it would all workout okay it was pretty scary at the time but looking back it was one of the best decisions i ever made
YOU1000000102_S0000117	the minute i dropped out i could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me and begin dropping in on the ones that looked far more interesting
YOU1000000102_S0000119	it wasn't all romantic i didn't have a dorm room so slept on the floor in friend's rooms i returned cope bottles for five cent deposits to buy food with
YOU1000000102_S0000120	and i would walk the seven miles across town every sunday night to get one good meal a week at the hari krishna temple
YOU1000000102_S0000122	i loved it and much of what i stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on let me give you one example
YOU1000000102_S0000124	reed college at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country
YOU1000000102_S0000125	throughout the campus every poster every label and every drawer was beautifully hand calligraphed because i had dropped out
YOU1000000102_S0000126	and didn't have to take the normal classes i decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this i learned about serif and sans-serif typefaces
YOU1000000102_S0000127	about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations about what makes great typography great
YOU1000000102_S0000129	it was beautiful historical artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture and i found it fascinating
YOU1000000102_S0000131	none of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life
YOU1000000102_S0000133	but ten years later when we were designing the first macintosh computer it all came back to me and we designed it all into the mac
YOU1000000102_S0000134	it was the first computer with beautiful typography if i had never dropped in on that single course in college
YOU1000000102_S0000135	the mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts and since windows just copied the mac it's likely that no personal computer would have them
YOU1000000102_S0000137	if i had never dropped out i would have never dropped in on that calligraphy class and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do
YOU1000000102_S0000138	of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when i was in college but it was very very clear looking backwards ten years later
YOU1000000102_S0000139	again you can't connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them looking backwards so you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future
YOU1000000102_S0000140	you have to trust in something your gut destiny life karma whatever because believing that the dots will connect
YOU1000000102_S0000141	down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the well-worn path and that will make all the difference
YOU1000000102_S0000143	my second story is about love and loss
YOU1000000102_S0000145	i was lucky i found what i loved to do early in life woz and i started apple in my parent's garage when i was twenty we worked hard
YOU1000000102_S0000146	and in ten years apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a two billion dollar company with over four thousand employees
YOU1000000102_S0000147	we just released our finest creation the macintosh a year earlier and i just turned thirty
YOU1000000102_S0000149	and then i got fired
YOU1000000102_S0000151	how can you get fired from a company you started
YOU1000000102_S0000153	well as apple grew we hired someone who i thought was very talented to run the company with me and for the first year or so things went well
YOU1000000102_S0000154	but then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out when we did our board of directors sided with him and so at thirty i was out
YOU1000000102_S0000155	and very publicly out what had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone and it was devastating
YOU1000000102_S0000157	i really didn't know what to do for a few months i felt that i had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down that i had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me
YOU1000000102_S0000158	i met with david packard and bob noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly
YOU1000000102_S0000160	i was a very public failure and i even thought about running away from the valley but something slowly began to dawn on me i still loved what i did
YOU1000000102_S0000162	the turn of events at apple had not changed that one bit i've been rejected but i was still in love
YOU1000000102_S0000164	and so i decided to start over
YOU1000000102_S0000166	i didn't see it then but it turned out that getting fired from apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me
YOU1000000102_S0000167	the heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again less sure about everything it freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life
YOU1000000102_S0000168	during the next five years i started a company named next another company named pixar and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife
YOU1000000102_S0000169	pixar went on to create the world's first computer animated feature film toy story and is now the most successful animation studio in the world
YOU1000000102_S0000171	in a remarkable turn of events apple bought next and i returned to apple and the technology we developed at next is at the heart of apple's current renaissance
YOU1000000102_S0000172	and laureen and i have a wonderful family together
YOU1000000102_S0000174	i'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if i hadn't been fired from apple it was awful tasting medicine but i guess the patient needed it
YOU1000000102_S0000176	sometime life sometimes life's going to hit you in the head with a brick don't lose faith
YOU1000000102_S0000178	i'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that i loved what i did you've got to find what you love and that is as true for work as it is for your lovers
YOU1000000102_S0000179	your work is going to fill a large part of your life and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work
YOU1000000102_S0000180	and the only way to do great work is to love what you do if you haven't found it yet keep looking
YOU1000000102_S0000182	and don't settle as with all matters of the heart you'll know when you find it and like any great relationship it just gets better and better
YOU1000000102_S0000183	as the years roll on so keep looking don't settle
YOU1000000102_S0000185	my third story is about death
YOU1000000102_S0000187	when i was seventeen i read a quote that went something like if you live each day as if it was your last someday you'll most certainly be right
YOU1000000102_S0000189	it made an impression on me and since then for the past thirty-three years i've looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself
YOU1000000102_S0000190	if today were the last day of my life what i want to do what i am about to do today and whenever the answer has been no for too many days in a row
YOU1000000102_S0000191	i know i need to change something
YOU1000000102_S0000193	remembering that i'll be dead soon is the most important tool i've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life because almost everything
YOU1000000102_S0000194	all external expectations all pride all fear of embarrassment or failure these things just fall away in the face of death leaving only what is truly important
YOU1000000102_S0000195	remembering that you are going to die is the best way i know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose you are already naked
YOU1000000102_S0000196	there is no reason not to follow your heart
YOU1000000102_S0000198	about a year ago i was diagnosed with cancer
YOU1000000102_S0000200	i had a scan at seven-thirty in the morning and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas i didn't even know what a pancreas was
YOU1000000102_S0000201	the doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable and that i should expect to live no longer than three to six months

YOU1000000105_S0000051	okay first of all like like social media quite frankly is the toilet of the internet
YOU1000000105_S0000052	yes it is

YOU1000000105_S0000057	we worked all week on that performance bradley who ah you know i like never relinquish control about a live stage performance and i've done a million of them
YOU1000000105_S0000058	which you know he directed this film and he directed all of you know obviously the musical moments in the film
YOU1000000105_S0000059	and he directed obviously shallow the moment in the film so i knew that he had the vision for how it should go
YOU1000000105_S0000060	and so i was like you know what do you what do you think bradley and he gave me he laid it all out everything that you saw the way that it was shot

YOU1000000105_S0000063	walk up on stage no intro all of that that was all him and he even also ah was the one that was like i think the audience should be lit so that we're not just lit the audience is lit
YOU1000000105_S0000064	so then i called roy bennett who i work with and he does my lightning and i am like we need to light the ah entire room with amber lights because bradley wants honeycomb and we got to give him what he wants

YOU1000000105_S0000074	bradley bradley did a great job i've known him for a long time and the idea of i mean it's one thing to go on stage and sing on the oscars that's terrifying just to start

YOU1000000108_S0000004	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000006	i was walking away from the circumstances
YOU1000000108_S0000007	uh-huh
YOU1000000108_S0000008	that that were coming with the new found plateau
YOU1000000108_S0000009	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000010	it takes a while when you punch through ah to adjust the atmosphere
YOU1000000108_S0000011	uh-hm
YOU1000000108_S0000012	it was completely outside of my frame of reference i've been in show business since i was fourteen and ah i've heard the stories
YOU1000000108_S0000013	uh-huh
YOU1000000108_S0000014	of what happens and i've seen these kinds of things play out in front of me
YOU1000000108_S0000015	okay when you say you heard the stories what do you mean what stories
YOU1000000108_S0000016	i mean you see before look mariah carey made hundred a million dollar deal and three months later she's all of a sudden mysteriously crazy
YOU1000000108_S0000017	or martin lawrence punches through and he's waving a gun on the street screaming they're trying to kill me
YOU1000000108_S0000018	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000020	yeah yeah yeah we hear those stories
YOU1000000108_S0000021	and it always happens around the time when the career would have it seems as though they're crossing over the next plateau
YOU1000000108_S0000022	yeah yeah would you say you lost your mind sort of
YOU1000000108_S0000024	no
YOU1000000108_S0000025	no
YOU1000000108_S0000026	not exactly
YOU1000000108_S0000027	okay
YOU1000000108_S0000028	ah i wasn't crazy but it is incredibly stressful
YOU1000000108_S0000029	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000030	and ah i felt like in a in a lot of instances i was deliberately being put through stress because ah you know when you're a guy that generates money
YOU1000000108_S0000031	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000032	people have a vested interest in controlling you
YOU1000000108_S0000033	yeah were they trying to control you because you know i read the time magazine article and they were quoted as saying you had extreme creative control
YOU1000000108_S0000034	and that you really ran your own show
YOU1000000108_S0000035	yeah ok but oprah i did two very successful seasons before that so why all of a sudden on the third time am i at africa by myself like what's happening
YOU1000000108_S0000036	yeah so what happened did you find yourself spiraling
YOU1000000108_S0000038	downward
YOU1000000108_S0000039	first of all yeah but
YOU1000000108_S0000041	i don't wanna make it as a thing where i'm absolving myself of any responsibility
YOU1000000108_S0000042	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000043	obviously um i'm partially responsible you know a lot of it has to do with me
YOU1000000108_S0000045	was there a tipping point for you
YOU1000000108_S0000046	i'll give you an example the first season ends
YOU1000000108_S0000047	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000048	ah and in the middle of the seasons there was a renegotiation
YOU1000000108_S0000049	okay
YOU1000000108_S0000050	ultimately through a series of events an an an and a little pressure ah i ended up ah settling for for way less than what i wanted ah
YOU1000000108_S0000052	and going forward and then in season two
YOU1000000108_S0000054	the d v d is released and it sets all these incredible records turns out the back
YOU1000000108_S0000055	a million in one day
YOU1000000108_S0000056	right
YOU1000000108_S0000057	one two point two million in a week the largest-selling television d v d of all time
YOU1000000108_S0000058	yeah yeah so now suddenly suddenly this is a bigger money-maker than they thought it was already making money but now all of a sudden it's a whole new revenue stream
YOU1000000108_S0000059	and my contract stuff ah
YOU1000000108_S0000060	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000062	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000063	you know so ah we finish the season so now you know the show is
YOU1000000108_S0000065	gaining popularity ratings are up every week it's it's i'm the toast of the town
YOU1000000108_S0000066	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000067	and ah
YOU1000000108_S0000069	when the season starts ending you know you get the question so ah dave ah what are you gonna do and blah blah blah and i knew to be real tight-lipped about it
YOU1000000108_S0000070	you know what like comedy central was a hot place to be when i showed up there
YOU1000000108_S0000071	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000073	but you turned it around your show turned it around became the most popular
YOU1000000108_S0000074	that's what i was thinking
YOU1000000108_S0000075	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000077	yeah yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000078	you know so ah an an and then there is there is this thing we're having argue all these arguments dave you got cut the poop joke and there was a lot of discussions about we know what our audience wants
YOU1000000108_S0000079	i was like ah whatever and and i mean they were wrong a hundred percent of the time
YOU1000000108_S0000080	ah huh
YOU1000000108_S0000081	as far as as far as what people will like
YOU1000000108_S0000082	ok
YOU1000000108_S0000083	and the show is an incredibly hard show to do that's the other thing
YOU1000000108_S0000085	chappelle show was ah
YOU1000000108_S0000087	i mean it's fun and all these things but it it there's a tremendous amount of work that goes into to making a show like that
YOU1000000108_S0000088	yeah people were saying though that you were on drugs you lost your mind you went into a mental institution what is true what is not
YOU1000000108_S0000089	not on drugs
YOU1000000108_S0000090	not on drugs
YOU1000000108_S0000091	nah not for years
YOU1000000108_S0000092	ah okay
YOU1000000108_S0000093	no i'm not on drugs
YOU1000000108_S0000094	and you weren't on drugs at the time
YOU1000000108_S0000095	no no not at all not at all i'm telling you i was incredibly stressed out
YOU1000000108_S0000096	ah you know love is like a nutrient
YOU1000000108_S0000098	and i was deficient on vitamin love
YOU1000000108_S0000099	really
YOU1000000108_S0000101	were you really
YOU1000000108_S0000103	now really what was going on
YOU1000000108_S0000104	man where do you start
YOU1000000108_S0000106	damn the story
YOU1000000108_S0000108	i ah
YOU1000000108_S0000110	i was doing sketches
YOU1000000108_S0000112	that were funny
YOU1000000108_S0000114	but socially irresponsible
YOU1000000108_S0000115	mm
YOU1000000108_S0000116	i felt like i was deliberately being encouraged and i was overwhelmed so
YOU1000000108_S0000117	it's like you're getting flooded with things and you don't pay attention to things like your ethics
YOU1000000108_S0000118	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000119	or when you get so overwhelmed it's like you had won the lottery
YOU1000000108_S0000120	explain
YOU1000000108_S0000121	let's say for your handlers for instance
YOU1000000108_S0000122	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000123	a lot of these people ah traditionally get paid on percentage basises the more you work
YOU1000000108_S0000124	the more they make
YOU1000000108_S0000125	the more they make
YOU1000000108_S0000126	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000127	you make that real money
YOU1000000108_S0000129	they lost their minds i thought they were crazy
YOU1000000108_S0000130	ah huh
YOU1000000108_S0000131	you know it was like you got to do everything
YOU1000000108_S0000132	yeah yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000133	so i got all these things then i got you know your own personal problems that get inflamed when this kind of money comes in
YOU1000000108_S0000134	and i got to write a show and do the show and i was overwhelmed
YOU1000000108_S0000136	and it was almost like
YOU1000000108_S0000138	i don't know it was almost as if this was happening deliberately
YOU1000000108_S0000139	ok you mentioned a moment ago that you felt that there were some things that weren't socially responsible like what
YOU1000000108_S0000141	like there's this one sketch that we did that was about the this pixie that would appear whenever racist things happens whenever someone make you feel like
YOU1000000108_S0000142	they calling you that n-word
YOU1000000108_S0000143	ah huh
YOU1000000108_S0000144	but don't say it and it was it was funny and ah the premise of the sketch was that every race had this like pixie this like racial complex
YOU1000000108_S0000146	and
YOU1000000108_S0000148	but the but the pixie was in blackface now
YOU1000000108_S0000150	blackface is a very difficult image but the reason i had chosen blackface at the time was because this was gonna to be the visual personification of the n word
YOU1000000108_S0000151	it was it the it was a it was a good spirit or intention behind it
YOU1000000108_S0000153	but what i didn't consider is how many people watch the show
YOU1000000108_S0000155	and how the way people use television is subjective
YOU1000000108_S0000156	i completely understand
YOU1000000108_S0000157	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000158	i call finish because i have a story to tell you
YOU1000000108_S0000159	so then when i'm on the set and we're finally taping the sketch
YOU1000000108_S0000161	somebody on the set that was white laughed in such a way i know the difference of people laughing with me and people laughing at me
YOU1000000108_S0000163	and it was the first time i'd ever gotten a laugh that i was uncomfortable with
YOU1000000108_S0000164	mm
YOU1000000108_S0000165	not just uncomfortable but like should i fire this person
YOU1000000108_S0000167	ah
YOU1000000108_S0000169	and at the same time i'm just not a naturally assertive person
YOU1000000108_S0000170	what was it about the laugh
YOU1000000108_S0000172	i know all these people be watching t v
YOU1000000108_S0000174	that there is a lot of people who will understand exactly what i'm doing
YOU1000000108_S0000176	then there's another group of people who are just fans like the the people that the kind of people that scream i'm rick james be at my concerts
YOU1000000108_S0000177	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000178	they're just along for a different kind of celebrity worship ride they're gonna get something
YOU1000000108_S0000180	completely different
YOU1000000108_S0000181	completely different
YOU1000000108_S0000182	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000183	that's concerning
YOU1000000108_S0000184	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000185	i didn't wanna i got to i mean i don't want black people to be disappointed in me for putting that out there
YOU1000000108_S0000186	no you you didn't want to be disappointed in yourself
YOU1000000108_S0000188	you know what oprah
YOU1000000108_S0000190	you're right
YOU1000000108_S0000191	yeah i still haven't gotten to why you just disappeared so you had that moment the guys are laughing too much was that the tipping point for you was that the straw
YOU1000000108_S0000192	that was the first tipping point
YOU1000000108_S0000193	okay
YOU1000000108_S0000194	and then they put in the paper that i had ah pneumonia or god knows what

YOU1000000108_S0000209	but you know okay so now it got worse and when i said i'm not gonna do it then all of a sudden it was like well now he has walking pneumonia and then i knew long before i walked i had considered walking
YOU1000000108_S0000210	you had considered
YOU1000000108_S0000211	i had considered walking because i went back to work and the vitamin love was gone because it was a real ugly negotiation
YOU1000000108_S0000212	it's a situation where now everybody's taking credit for this and that and the other it's all it's just it was getting ridiculous and i knew i was gonna leave so i got ahead of schedule and i bounced
YOU1000000108_S0000213	and i didn't tell anybody where i was going
YOU1000000108_S0000215	the whole time they're trying to convince me i'm insane
YOU1000000108_S0000217	they were trying to get me to take psychotic medication
YOU1000000108_S0000219	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000221	like i'm sitting around you know i was stressed out but the people that were telling me i was insane i believe that they knew what was going on
YOU1000000108_S0000223	so ah this was troublesome
YOU1000000108_S0000224	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000226	i'm not taking this medicine man because i know how these people be trying to control you or or maybe discredit you i was afraid like you know
YOU1000000108_S0000227	but you were stressed out that's why
YOU1000000108_S0000228	there's no question but it's very stressful for someone to constantly walk behind you and say you're insane
YOU1000000108_S0000229	oh hey how about this i show up to work first week and they where my office used to be they built a wall there
YOU1000000108_S0000231	why
YOU1000000108_S0000232	i didn't know why
YOU1000000108_S0000234	but it came out later that they were like well they said you wanted it i don't want to be walled up at the office
YOU1000000108_S0000235	i like hanging out and talking
YOU1000000108_S0000236	ok so you got up and you walked out and nobody knew where you were going did your family know
YOU1000000108_S0000238	nah well no i called my brother
YOU1000000108_S0000239	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000240	me and my brother real cool i called him up and was like i'm going to africa he was like cool man that's good

YOU1000000108_S0000243	no nobody knew
YOU1000000108_S0000244	no i bounced
YOU1000000108_S0000246	now that sounds a little crazy
YOU1000000108_S0000247	it's not crazy because the situation kind of warranted it
YOU1000000108_S0000248	okay
YOU1000000108_S0000249	ah because certain people around me were putting my sanity in question i would meet too much obstruction if i would say i'm doing something like this
YOU1000000108_S0000250	yeah okay
YOU1000000108_S0000251	so i figured it wasn't that i didn't tell my wife it was like i'm not telling her till after i'm gone which was a mistake
YOU1000000108_S0000252	but it wasn't a crazy mistake it's just a dude's
YOU1000000108_S0000253	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000255	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000256	as a husband she should have known where you were gone is that what you're saying
YOU1000000108_S0000257	she was gonna know you know i basically i called my brother i told and i gave him a list you call so-and-so and so-and-so and so-and-so and i took off
YOU1000000108_S0000259	then i called my wife
YOU1000000108_S0000260	okay why were you going to africa specifically
YOU1000000108_S0000261	one i needed a break
YOU1000000108_S0000262	needed a break
YOU1000000108_S0000263	two we have family friends down there and three i just felt like ah it was a place where i could really
YOU1000000108_S0000265	reflect it's just a place that i got to go
YOU1000000108_S0000266	and what did you conclude about yourself
YOU1000000108_S0000268	oh well that i wasn't paying attention i felt really guilty about being asleep at the wheel
YOU1000000108_S0000270	i felt guilty about it because i
YOU1000000108_S0000272	i forgot the the hos hostility of the environment of show business
YOU1000000108_S0000274	it's ah you know it's not a ah docile environment it's a challenging environment
YOU1000000108_S0000275	yes
YOU1000000108_S0000276	you know and there's some quote that someone had told me it says success takes you where character cannot sustain you
YOU1000000108_S0000277	wow that's a good quote
YOU1000000108_S0000278	yeah okay i don't care who you think you are or how you think you do it you cannot imagine
YOU1000000108_S0000280	what celebrities go through
YOU1000000108_S0000282	as far as how your integrity and your self image and all these things
YOU1000000108_S0000283	ok this is a theory that i've always had and i've discussed this with other people the idea that if you don't know who you are when this big thing hits when the big stuff comes
YOU1000000108_S0000284	if you don't know who you are and can't stand in the center of yourself then you end up confused and feeling thwarted and feeling diffused in many directions
YOU1000000108_S0000285	because everybody is pulling on you would you say that that was a part of your issue trying to figure find the center for yourself
YOU1000000108_S0000286	absolutely
YOU1000000108_S0000287	when you are suddenly given a fifty million dollar contract when you've been making i don't know what before that is a lot to to orchestrate to handle and a lot for other people to figure out
YOU1000000108_S0000288	in that sense it was like all right you're the c e o of a fifty million dollar company good luck
YOU1000000108_S0000289	yeah yeah now you figure it out
YOU1000000108_S0000290	right
YOU1000000108_S0000291	but you've worked your whole life for it you wanted it
YOU1000000108_S0000293	you know struggled to get it sacrificed sacrificed rejected many times told that things wouldn't work wouldn't work wouldn't work and then all of a sudden you're the genius
YOU1000000108_S0000294	and we're gonna give you fifty million dollars and that was too much for you to handle
YOU1000000108_S0000296	no that's the thing that i always read that makes me mad no it was the fame couldn't stand the fame
YOU1000000108_S0000297	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000298	i love being famous
YOU1000000108_S0000299	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000301	it's phenomenal when i came out here and everybody was like hooray i was like ah back on tv
YOU1000000108_S0000303	ok so that's clear it's not the fame it's what
YOU1000000108_S0000304	it's the way that people around you position themselves around you to get in your pockets and in your mind
YOU1000000108_S0000305	yeah yeah yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000306	that it is infuriating to me
YOU1000000108_S0000307	you know one of one of the phrases i always loved is to whom much is given much is expected and part of it is
YOU1000000108_S0000308	i know i'm like spider-man peter with great power comes great responsibility
YOU1000000108_S0000309	no no no but it doses but it does it does and part of that is not just being up on stage
YOU1000000108_S0000311	it's handling the rest of the business and handling all the people that are lined up at your door for whatever reason
YOU1000000108_S0000312	yeah yeah you are absolutely right
YOU1000000108_S0000313	don't get the fifty million with no no strings attached
YOU1000000108_S0000314	yeah but at a certain point it was like all right this is enough
YOU1000000108_S0000315	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000316	colleagues were quoted as saying that you had become ah increasingly paranoid would you say you were paranoid
YOU1000000108_S0000317	sure first of all what is a black man without his paranoia intact
YOU1000000108_S0000319	and if you get if you get
YOU1000000108_S0000321	you might win a hundred dollars in a poker game and be on the subway you gonna look over your shoulder
YOU1000000108_S0000323	they just said in everything i had fifty million dollars that's like that's like making me a marked man
YOU1000000108_S0000324	so did you go to a psychiatric hospital
YOU1000000108_S0000325	in south africa
YOU1000000108_S0000326	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000327	who
YOU1000000108_S0000329	oh yeah that's right i i was so
YOU1000000108_S0000330	i'm only asking
YOU1000000108_S0000331	no i'm just i got to get people thinking all right who goes from america to africa for medical attention
YOU1000000108_S0000333	so true
YOU1000000108_S0000335	i i cannot imagine
YOU1000000108_S0000336	yeah yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000337	this is sound like the most irresponsible journalism in the world i cannot imagine
YOU1000000108_S0000338	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000339	being a journalist and hearing this
YOU1000000108_S0000340	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000341	from from these people
YOU1000000108_S0000343	and just running with it was on everything
YOU1000000108_S0000344	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000345	as a fact
YOU1000000108_S0000346	yeah hi youtubers i am excited to give you an update about our own youtube channel now you can find new videos everyday there are the kind of videos that will make you look at life differently they may even make you laugh a little bit
YOU1000000108_S0000347	subscribe to the own channel today and will see you on youtube
YOU1000000109_S0000000	a little over three minutes plus additional time remaining
YOU1000000109_S0000002	as so often portugal's hopes rest on cristiano ronaldo's shoulders
YOU1000000109_S0000004	ronaldo
YOU1000000109_S0000006	it's a warm indeed very humid night here in sochi there is a very tangible sense of anticipation
YOU1000000109_S0000007	it's portugal's first game at the twenty-eighteen fifa world cup russia cristiano ronaldo is appearing at his fourth world cup
YOU1000000109_S0000008	the third in which he'll captain his country
YOU1000000109_S0000009	yeah so portugal went into the twenty-eighteen world cup as european champions they won euro twenty-sixteen beat france the host in the final
YOU1000000109_S0000010	i think there were a lot of expectations about portugal going into the world cup that perhaps they could finally go farther than just the group stage and the round of sixteen
YOU1000000109_S0000011	cristiano faces the nation he has just spent the last nine years plying his trade in spain
YOU1000000109_S0000012	i think that definitely motivated ronaldo himself you know a lot of those players would have been his teammates of course at real madrid
YOU1000000109_S0000013	he really wanted to leave everything on the field and that's exactly what we saw
YOU1000000109_S0000015	renaldo is that a penalty it is
YOU1000000109_S0000016	it doesn't take long for cr seven to make his mark
YOU1000000109_S0000017	inside the opening three minutes cristiano ronaldo foul in the penalty area
YOU1000000109_S0000018	cristiano now has the chance to score for his country from the penalty spot he's been here before
YOU1000000109_S0000021	twenty-one year old cristiano ronaldo
YOU1000000109_S0000023	waits for referee pular's whistle composes himself
YOU1000000109_S0000025	and scores
YOU1000000109_S0000027	he had been at the euros two years prior and they made it to the finals losing out to greece
YOU1000000109_S0000028	he was already arguably portugal's most potent attacking weapon and that was a really good portugal team
YOU1000000109_S0000029	they early note his team that ronaldo found himself part of the a phenomenal team in terms of talent
YOU1000000109_S0000030	one reason why ronaldo did well at that tournament he wasn't portugal's sole focus point
YOU1000000109_S0000031	you know you had seymour subrosa who was doing very well of course you had luis figo you had deco
YOU1000000109_S0000032	the netherlands game in the last sixteen was actually a brutal experience for ronaldo
YOU1000000109_S0000033	the netherlands tried to take him out of the game take him out of the equation and that's what they did an absolutely horrendous tackle
YOU1000000109_S0000034	that was a very scandalous game where you had sixteen yellow cards you had four red cards i mean that was a really difficult game for both teams ah for cristiano that was a learning moment
YOU1000000109_S0000035	as he got older and he got fitter and more muscular if you like stronger and that's probably a game he would have been able to ride more
YOU1000000109_S0000036	it was more what happened in that game against england that took all the headlines
YOU1000000109_S0000037	there is ah this fault of rooney against ricardo carvajal
YOU1000000109_S0000038	and rooney and all the english team said that cristiano go to the referee to say give him red card
YOU1000000109_S0000039	and there he is walking over to the bench he gives a nice little wink and of course everybody in england understandably was very upset
YOU1000000109_S0000040	i mean it definitely i think was an early sign of what was to come over the next few years in terms of christian ronaldo and his personality
YOU1000000109_S0000041	the england game actually ended perfectly for ronaldo despite all his controversy as he took the winning penalty in the shootout
YOU1000000109_S0000043	it's all over for england portugal going to the last four
YOU1000000109_S0000044	they overcame him on penalties and then lost to a french team as inspired by zinedine zidane who's absolutely exceptional in that game
YOU1000000109_S0000045	and it's his world cup at the moment zinedine zidane
YOU1000000109_S0000046	portugal tried to get back into it ah quite close on a few occasions
YOU1000000109_S0000047	he goes for gold but it can't hold it oh what a chance missed
YOU1000000109_S0000048	but just wasn't to be
YOU1000000109_S0000050	cristiano ronaldo against david de gea
YOU1000000109_S0000051	it's one nil portugal and was there ever any doubt it just had to be him
YOU1000000109_S0000052	portugal's lead only lasts twenty minutes
YOU1000000109_S0000053	pepe gets the header and goes down play continues it's diego costa can he get the shot away costa scores
YOU1000000109_S0000055	well ronaldo's mentality isn't it i think that's what makes him the player he is
YOU1000000109_S0000056	just before half time cristiano has slipped the ball on the edge of the box
YOU1000000109_S0000057	ronaldo with the shot oh it's gone in an error from david de gea and cristiano ronaldo gets portugal's second goal of the night
YOU1000000109_S0000058	portugal are back in front tonight cristiano is on a mission against spain perhaps motivated by revenge for what happened in the past
YOU1000000109_S0000062	ronaldo twenty-ten was a very very different ronaldo to ronaldo two thousand and six
YOU1000000109_S0000063	between those two world cups he signed for real madrid he becomes the most expensive player to sign for the club and in the world at that point in time for a ninety-four million euros
YOU1000000109_S0000064	and at that point he had become the leader and the captain of portugal
YOU1000000109_S0000065	with a room in which the turn for ronaldo made room for the shot oh off the post what a strike
YOU1000000109_S0000066	he had a different manager to play under first he had different teammates arguably the best player in the world after winning champions league with manchester united the attention is drawn to him much more than before
YOU1000000109_S0000067	here's ronaldo no free kick
YOU1000000109_S0000068	carlos k raj the coach had come in unfortunately for portugal it all went horribly wrong the relationship between ronaldo and k raj was very strained
YOU1000000109_S0000069	and i think that was really stemmed from the tactics employed by k raj
YOU1000000109_S0000070	his whole tactic seemed to be let's just make our team as difficult to score against as possible and our attacking system would just be whack the ball up to ronaldo and let him work some magic on his own
YOU1000000109_S0000071	and it just didn't work at all
YOU1000000109_S0000072	great opportunity here for brazil to come see
YOU1000000109_S0000073	ronaldo scores once ah during that tournament albeit was an excellent goal ah against north korea where he's sort of juggling actually he balanced the ball on the back of his neck and sort of rolled it over the top of his head and then scored
YOU1000000109_S0000074	and then it was the derby ah the iberian derby
YOU1000000109_S0000075	and they got knocked out to spain who at least for them a bit of comfort is knowing that they went on to win the whole tournament altogether
YOU1000000109_S0000076	and they were a fabulous spanish side nobody really could take them apart nobody could really beat them at all
YOU1000000109_S0000077	it's true that spain have a beautiful team at this time
YOU1000000109_S0000078	i think there was a lot of pressure on cristiano ronaldo to be this big figure since he was this worldwide superstar but unfortunately he came up against
YOU1000000109_S0000079	this spanish wall that he just wasn't able to break through
YOU1000000109_S0000080	after the game ronaldo was asked what went wrong and i think he told the germans to ask carlos quiroz in quite a pointed fashion
YOU1000000109_S0000081	i think it's one world cup which you can't really blame him at all for his lack of production it was definitely just the team wasn't set up to get the best out of him at all
YOU1000000109_S0000082	the world cup disappointing in the finish disappointing and not not scoring the goals that people expected him to score but it was the foundation for him as a player to to improve on and build
YOU1000000109_S0000084	ronaldo with the shot oh it's gone in
YOU1000000109_S0000085	eight years later and portugal are now the ones with the upper hand they lead two-one with forty-five minutes left on the clock
YOU1000000109_S0000086	cristiano ronaldo has turned this group match back in portugal's favor
YOU1000000109_S0000087	with spain applying more pressure there's not too much cristiano can do except hope his defense will hold firm
YOU1000000109_S0000088	silva with a little chip back across goal turned in diego costa strikes again
YOU1000000109_S0000089	a simple free-kick move from spain and for the second time tonight in sochi spain have equalized
YOU1000000109_S0000090	but then there's not much the defense can do when the ball falls to nacho
YOU1000000109_S0000091	now it might drop for the shot here oh what a shot that is nacho the man who gave away the penalty early on in this match
YOU1000000109_S0000093	has redeemed himself in style
YOU1000000109_S0000094	thanks to a wonder strike spain have turned the game around they now lead three-two and it looks like history is set to repeat itself
YOU1000000109_S0000095	it seems cristiano can't shake his bad luck at the world cup
YOU1000000109_S0000097	germany lead the height of hummels the goal of humbles germany get another one and they do terrible terrible defending germany have got four
YOU1000000109_S0000098	what a dreadful day and an awful start for portugal
YOU1000000109_S0000099	so in the way that ronaldo had progressed quite a lot between two thousand six and two thousand ten he progressed equally a far distance between two thousand and ten and two thousand fourteen he went to that tournament the champions league winner with real madrid ballon d'or winner
YOU1000000109_S0000100	it was not a great tournament ah he have a lot of problem a physical problem but he wants to stay he wants to be there
YOU1000000109_S0000101	so he decided to play through the pain and to play through the injury
YOU1000000109_S0000102	because he felt that without him they weren't going to be able to advance but it didn't matter in the end because it just didn't it didn't work out
YOU1000000109_S0000103	germany were phenomenal in twenty-fourteen actually went on to win the tournament but nevertheless to get beat four nil it was portugal's heaviest defeat at a world cup it was pretty humiliating
YOU1000000109_S0000104	portugal were really ronaldo centric at this time
YOU1000000109_S0000105	against the united states that defense they they really put a clamp down and it was very difficult for him
YOU1000000109_S0000106	with the ball in bradley chance for u s a and it's a goal
YOU1000000109_S0000107	it was quite amazing actually that ronaldo managed to to pull out of the bag a chance to keep their world cup alive just by the slimmest of threads virtually the last kick of the game
YOU1000000109_S0000109	unless we have a most dramatic twist in the final seconds now into the last thirty oh and we have it's a dream of a cross from ronaldo
YOU1000000109_S0000110	and morella buries it
YOU1000000109_S0000111	he was gonna play until the last whistle of every game that's his mentality that is what he drives for he's not gonna rest
YOU1000000109_S0000112	and i think he figures you know even if i have you know my leg amputated i'm going to go out there and i'm going to still try and score or at least set somebody else up to score
YOU1000000109_S0000113	because he's just that focused and that determined
YOU1000000109_S0000114	and the last game against ghana all sorts of permutations portugal was still in of a shelter qualifying that basically they needed to win and win big
YOU1000000109_S0000115	ronaldo managed to score the goal but it was already quite near towards the end of the game
YOU1000000109_S0000116	maybe now ronaldo yes he has goal number fifty of his international career
YOU1000000109_S0000117	it was too little too late at that point and the damage was done and they weren't able to get out of the group and they crashed out very early on in the world cup
YOU1000000109_S0000118	in a very disappointing world cup for portugal he was probably portugal's best player
YOU1000000109_S0000119	it was probably at that moment maybe that's the gap between portugal's best player ronaldo and the rest of the team was most exposed
YOU1000000109_S0000120	it's definitely a world cup where portugal paid the price for just not being fit enough
YOU1000000109_S0000122	ronaldo goes down gets a free kick challenge is by pique now this is a key moment we know who's going to strike it
YOU1000000109_S0000123	the game approaches its final minutes cristiano stands over a free kick displaying his trademark stance
YOU1000000109_S0000124	this for his hat trick and to save portugal from defeat
YOU1000000109_S0000126	ronaldo
YOU1000000109_S0000128	oh genius absolute genius would you believe it
YOU1000000109_S0000129	it was a phenomenal goal everybody at that point just kind of fell out of this season and said okay it's not spain's day we just need to accept that this is all about cristiano ronaldo
YOU1000000109_S0000130	you don't see those individual performances in the world cup that often
YOU1000000109_S0000131	it actually sums up ronaldo a brilliant goal scored in a huge game at a critical moment
YOU1000000109_S0000132	exemplary perfection and it's a hat trick for cristiano ronaldo
YOU1000000109_S0000134	in their next game against morocco cristiano's fine form continues as he scores the decisive goal in a promising performance
YOU1000000109_S0000136	he is a sensation
YOU1000000109_S0000138	he would be his eighty-fifth goal in the international ah scene he would pass ferenc puskas
YOU1000000109_S0000139	and so he then became the highest goal scorer in europe in international football and the second overall in the world
YOU1000000109_S0000140	against i r iran a quaresma wonder goal puts portugal ahead
YOU1000000109_S0000141	was cristiano's world cup luck turning at last
YOU1000000109_S0000142	this will give portugal breathing space
YOU1000000109_S0000144	ronaldo is denied
YOU1000000109_S0000146	and the game and the group are still very much alive
YOU1000000109_S0000147	cristiano's missed penalty ultimately costs portugal the top spot in their group
YOU1000000109_S0000148	which means they'll face uruguay in the round of sixteen a formidable opponent
YOU1000000109_S0000149	round of sixteen they run into uruguay which is a tough matchup because their defense is geared it's very physical really caused ah problems for cristiano ronaldo
YOU1000000109_S0000150	raul was able to deal with the considerable threat not his finest hour from a free-kick suarez over on that far side and it's pinpoint
YOU1000000109_S0000152	oh dangerous cross cavani it's them again
YOU1000000109_S0000153	unfortunately for portugal they really only got going in the second half when they were really backs against the wall
YOU1000000109_S0000154	adrian silva shot the deflection for a corner
YOU1000000109_S0000155	pepe has done it
YOU1000000109_S0000157	well there's the answer they were looking for
YOU1000000109_S0000159	but they really didn't do themselves justice and i think uruguay were deserved winners at the end two brilliant goals you have to say
YOU1000000109_S0000160	hernandez four on three for a moment here cavani brilliant that is pure gold
YOU1000000109_S0000161	for the fourth time in his career cristiano ronaldo is knocked out of the world cup
YOU1000000109_S0000162	it's all over and maybe it is the end in terms of world cups for the great cristiano ronaldo
YOU1000000109_S0000163	in that world cup he showed one last time if it is the last time that he is such a prolific goal scorer that is legendary
YOU1000000109_S0000164	i think twenty-eighteen in a way sums up ronaldo's international career which is exceptionally talented a play for the big occasion but just part of a team that bar france in twenty sixteen has never been good enough to to win one of the major honors
YOU1000000109_S0000165	we don't know if that will be his last world cup i don't think it will be i think there's a very good chance that we could see him at qatar twenty twenty-two he'll be thirty-seven years old
YOU1000000109_S0000166	by the time that world cup rolls around
YOU1000000109_S0000168	ronaldo will not be portugal's sole attacking threat so you could argue that the stage was perfectly set for him to really thrive in this world cup
YOU1000000109_S0000169	as part of an exciting attacking team as the the elder statesman and perhaps put those former world cups where he didn't perhaps do himself justice you know put that to rights
YOU1000000110_S0000002	the moment in his life all force and all well applaud for the netherlands
YOU1000000110_S0000003	saved by romero
YOU1000000110_S0000005	and who have argentina sent up first of course lionel messi
YOU1000000110_S0000007	the man for all moments
YOU1000000110_S0000009	for many on planet football the number one the man
YOU1000000110_S0000011	the two thousand forty fifa world cup brazil was perhaps the most important tournament in lionel messi's career
YOU1000000110_S0000013	so in twenty-fourteen there was still a lot of expectation for this player who had been breaking all sorts of goal scoring records at club level
YOU1000000110_S0000014	but never truly excelled at international levels
YOU1000000110_S0000017	messi made sure that their first match against bosnia and herzegovina went to plan
YOU1000000110_S0000018	that was captain yaro it's a devilish delivery team the argentines have all control
YOU1000000110_S0000021	messi can do it its lionel messi he score
YOU1000000110_S0000023	in a win for argentina where they look solid and set up the tournament really for the expectation that they could go a long way
YOU1000000110_S0000025	however the next game against minnows iran wasn't quite so straightforward
YOU1000000110_S0000026	argentina the top team in south american qualifying against iran
YOU1000000110_S0000027	it was a tough game for argentina because around defending really well argentina didn't have that many chances during the game
YOU1000000110_S0000028	this is not argentina's day so far
YOU1000000110_S0000029	a win would send argentina through to the next round and with seconds left no one knew that better than their captain
YOU1000000110_S0000030	he could go for goal and oh my goodness gracious me if one man could win a football match it would be lionel messi
YOU1000000110_S0000031	messy produced maybe his most spectacular individual moments at a world cup
YOU1000000110_S0000032	classic messi we've seen him do it time and time again
YOU1000000110_S0000033	messi an unbelievably talented player leading his country to victory
YOU1000000110_S0000034	the prophecy that had been made about a wonderkid many years ago was now being fulfilled
YOU1000000110_S0000036	it was really at youth world championships with argentina when he burst into public consciousness
YOU1000000110_S0000037	he was the absolute star of that tournament he actually didn't start the tournament in the team
YOU1000000110_S0000038	you know it was very evident the kind of player he was the way that he was at times head and shoulders above everyone else in the game
YOU1000000110_S0000039	lets start and let do it again although he's pulling his goal lionel messi
YOU1000000110_S0000040	semi-final against brazil he scored from outside the box early on a thunderous shot into the top corner
YOU1000000110_S0000041	check probably starts by one of the players of the tournament lionel messi
YOU1000000110_S0000042	and that took them into the final and again messi was the hero in the final he scored both goals in a two-one win over nigeria and they were champions
YOU1000000110_S0000043	that's his penalty and he scores
YOU1000000110_S0000044	being the star player he was named player of the tournament he was the leading scorer
YOU1000000110_S0000046	argentina's trophy and it's a fifth world crown
YOU1000000110_S0000047	that tournament that few weeks in the netherlands when the world knew we've got a special player on our house
YOU1000000110_S0000048	i think within argentina it was quite a clamor for him to be in the squad for for two thousand and six there was a lot of interest when he came off the bench against serbia in in ah the group game
YOU1000000110_S0000049	and lionel messi becomes the youngest argentine player to play at a world cup since nineteen thirty-four
YOU1000000110_S0000052	it's messi he just had to score
YOU1000000110_S0000053	that was going to be the perfect start ah to the world cup
YOU1000000110_S0000055	the hero of argentina the player they've clamored for to be included has scored a six
YOU1000000110_S0000056	it doesn't have a happy ending in two thousand and six and it could have done because they played germany in the court finals the game goes to penalties and lionel messi is left on the bench
YOU1000000110_S0000059	again because of circumstances beyond his control he was left watching from the sidelines in the decisive moment in his team's season
YOU1000000110_S0000062	lionel messi's career could have been very very different how did he play against germany
YOU1000000110_S0000064	though already qualified topping the group would mean an easier route to the final and a better chance at lifting the world cup
YOU1000000110_S0000065	it was nigeria they needed to beat and with his sights set on lifting that coveted trophy so began the messy show
YOU1000000110_S0000066	the third group game was on the back of messi he scored the opening goal very early on
YOU1000000110_S0000067	on the first one absolutely hammers it into the roof and there's no stopping it
YOU1000000110_S0000068	who was gonna get this first messi was
YOU1000000110_S0000069	nigeria weren't an easy team to play against had a lot of attacking talent his second goal against nigeria is a stunning free kick
YOU1000000110_S0000070	extraordinary just everything you want from a free kick
YOU1000000110_S0000071	the argentina came away with the three two win um on the back of two messi goals
YOU1000000110_S0000072	he was heading into the knockout stages having argentina one three out of three looking like a team that could go all the way
YOU1000000110_S0000074	against switzerland la albiceleste once again struggled to find a way through against a tough opponent
YOU1000000110_S0000075	game seven of the round of sixteen
YOU1000000110_S0000076	opposition fundable intent on on trying to stop messi he was a man in form and a man intent on taking argentina all the way switzerland tough opponents not much in the game
YOU1000000110_S0000077	and looked like it was going to go to penalties
YOU1000000110_S0000078	this time messi would leave it right up until the one hundred and eighteenth minute before making the difference
YOU1000000110_S0000080	argentina one hell argentina
YOU1000000110_S0000081	just before the dreaded penalty shoots out argentina had found their way into the last eight
YOU1000000110_S0000082	and argentina now surely are safely through the quarterfinals
YOU1000000110_S0000083	against the belgium it would be quite the opposite messi capitalizing on a mistake for first few minutes
YOU1000000110_S0000084	they started off superbly with the goal
YOU1000000110_S0000085	argentina were able to show that they had this collective structure which they've been lacking in the past that it wasn't just a one-man team an d that if they got ahead
YOU1000000110_S0000086	they could defend for the rest of the game and just close out a game to win it one night which is exactly what they did
YOU1000000110_S0000087	is it clear goal argentina score in the last eight minutes of the game
YOU1000000110_S0000088	messi's men held firm to win the match he had now done what no argentinian captain had managed in the past twenty-four years
YOU1000000110_S0000089	he had led his country to the semi-finals messi was finally in the last four
YOU1000000110_S0000090	although it hadn't been easy there had been much pain along the way
YOU1000000110_S0000092	by the time the next world cup rolled around in two thousand ten in south africa he was the best player in the world
YOU1000000110_S0000093	it was an incredible story would maradona be able to leave messi to the title look back at the highlights from nearly every game messi's involved in almost everything but he doesn't score
YOU1000000110_S0000095	and ultimately it wasn't able to make much of a difference against germany
YOU1000000110_S0000097	the team system was completely different it never looked convincing
YOU1000000110_S0000098	again germany just as happens in two thousand and six with a team to put in a sort but this time in a far more convincing way
YOU1000000110_S0000099	from your opinion the sweat saves was no way that anything was gonna happen other when when the germany pictured
YOU1000000110_S0000100	they're queuing up again here it's going to be put on a plate
YOU1000000110_S0000101	he said i think he ends up taking a lot of the blame for argentina's disastrous performance
YOU1000000110_S0000102	deeply frustrating for messi because he came away from that tournament knowing that he hadn't played particularly well but also knowing that he didn't really have the chance to because the way the team was structured just didn't allow it
YOU1000000110_S0000103	what will be regarded as a day of disaster for argentina argentina nil germany four
YOU1000000110_S0000106	argentina the last south american standing in brazil which of these will meet it at the american
YOU1000000110_S0000107	the semi-final neither argentina nor the netherlands have managed to score after one hundred twenty minutes
YOU1000000110_S0000108	the team that makes the world cup final will now be decided on penalties
YOU1000000110_S0000110	who fancies it who fancies it boys it is the dutch first
YOU1000000110_S0000112	and it is big one what a moment in his life all force all will against netherlands
YOU1000000110_S0000113	saved by romero
YOU1000000110_S0000114	the netherlands was again a very tough tight game
YOU1000000110_S0000115	this is when keepers come alive
YOU1000000110_S0000117	and who have argentina sent up first of course lionel messi the man for all moments
YOU1000000110_S0000119	for many on planet football the number one the man
YOU1000000110_S0000121	messi for sure
YOU1000000110_S0000122	captain leads by example scoring his penalty
YOU1000000110_S0000123	there is no occasion too big
YOU1000000110_S0000124	absorbing messi's confidence argentina then proceed to score their next two spot kicks
YOU1000000110_S0000126	grizzly strider oh what a save what a save
YOU1000000110_S0000127	it all comes down to maxi rodriguez a player from messi's hometown
YOU1000000110_S0000128	with this highly charged moment it's in an argentina
YOU1000000110_S0000129	a real bound
YOU1000000110_S0000132	argentina are set on capturing the big one on brazilian soil
YOU1000000110_S0000133	now only one team stood between argentina and the trophy and it was a familiar foe
YOU1000000110_S0000134	you don't need more motivation when you're in a world cup final we're not going to let them beat us again
YOU1000000110_S0000135	you had the feeling that this is their year this is messi's opportunity
YOU1000000110_S0000136	messi's argentina would face germany once again
YOU1000000110_S0000139	germany and argentina perhaps planet football's greatest intercontinental rivalry
YOU1000000110_S0000141	there are three key moments i remember really in that final from messi's point of view one was when a mistake by germany sent gonzalo clean through on goal
YOU1000000110_S0000142	that moment was so crucial to his career yet ironically he wasn't directly involved in it
YOU1000000110_S0000143	the first half saw chances on both sides
YOU1000000110_S0000144	lionel messi
YOU1000000110_S0000145	and early in the second messi had his chance
YOU1000000110_S0000146	received a throughput in one of his favorite positions
YOU1000000110_S0000148	he didn't miss it by much but he did miss it and that will be a moment that will haunt messi for the rest of his life
YOU1000000110_S0000150	one hundred and fifteen minutes gone and these sides still couldn't be separated it was a stalemate until
YOU1000000110_S0000153	germany by this stage had got the goal to go ahead
YOU1000000110_S0000154	taken with touch with finesse
YOU1000000110_S0000155	game wasn't over
YOU1000000110_S0000156	the final moment really of the match the final significant moment bastion schweinsteiger fouled messi
YOU1000000110_S0000157	it was a long way out he was here in a world cup final with a chance to save his team
YOU1000000110_S0000158	this is messy this is the moment
YOU1000000110_S0000160	lionel messi no no no no no no it's gone away it's got away
YOU1000000110_S0000162	the moment was too much for him
YOU1000000110_S0000163	and germany go on and win the game and and messi's on the losing side
YOU1000000110_S0000164	i think that messy free kick in two thousand and fourteen is a moment where a lot of argentina fans will feel that could have been their chance
YOU1000000110_S0000165	argentina's world cup dream history his dream of his lifetime was over
YOU1000000110_S0000166	now germany are the champions of the world
YOU1000000110_S0000167	it was so devastating when they lost in that final because it was an opportunity for us to watch the greatest player of a generation go on and win the world cup
YOU1000000110_S0000169	it really started to change the many of people's ideas in argentina about messi for the national team
YOU1000000110_S0000170	this is really
YOU1000000110_S0000174	in two thousand and eighteen there was so much um expectation on messi can he take them to the final and win it this time
YOU1000000110_S0000175	two thousand and eighteen for me was the realization that messi can't do it alone messi needs more quality around them
YOU1000000110_S0000177	there was one outstanding moment for messi in the tournament his goal against nigeria he made a run off the shoulders of the defender
YOU1000000110_S0000178	flighted and floated and taken into his stride by lionel messi to make it one nil
YOU1000000110_S0000179	to control the ball on his thigh then take a touch of his left foot then finish with his right without breaking stride
YOU1000000110_S0000181	it's mesmerizing but in the end it wasn't enough because argentina just weren't good enough they they never looked like being good enough
YOU1000000110_S0000182	right at the end of the game against france they fought back messi flicked over the ball for aguero to head home
YOU1000000110_S0000183	and argentina have another one hang on a minute sergio aguero
YOU1000000110_S0000184	and they had a last attack and that was the final challenge
YOU1000000110_S0000185	argentina very very nearly for the whistle has gone
YOU1000000110_S0000186	at the end of the day in two thousand nineteen we just saw lionel messi and he's cutting a despondent figure and i think it was a moment when you realize that he can't do it alone
YOU1000000110_S0000187	but messi is out of the world cup in argentina around france have won it
YOU1000000110_S0000188	he's won everything la ligas copa del rey champions league world club cup but he's not won the world cup
YOU1000000110_S0000189	he wants to win the world cup because he's a winner because he's a champion because he's won everything else but not to prove anything
YOU1000000110_S0000190	and he knows that that will define his legacy it's there's going to be another shot you'd imagine in twenty twenty-two but if it was to end today
YOU1000000110_S0000191	you would look back and say it's disappointing because he's arguably the best player of all the time
YOU1000000110_S0000192	and the one thing you want in the trophy cabinet of the best player of all time is a world cup
YOU1000000110_S0000193	he will have one last chance

YOU1000000114_S0000008	ladies and gentleman referee herb dean has called a stop to this contest at four minutes fifty-seven seconds of round number two
YOU1000000114_S0000009	declaring the winner by team k o and now the new interim u f c feather weight champion of the world
YOU1000000114_S0000010	the notorious conor mcgregor
YOU1000000115_S0000000	how the economic machine works in thirty minutes
YOU1000000115_S0000002	the economy works like a simple machine but many people don't understand it or they don't agree on how it works
YOU1000000115_S0000003	and this has led to a lot of needless economic suffering
YOU1000000115_S0000005	i feel a deep sense of responsibility to share my simple but practical economic template
YOU1000000115_S0000007	though it's unconventional
YOU1000000115_S0000009	it has helped me to anticipate and to side-step the global financial crisis and it is worked well for me for over thirty years
YOU1000000115_S0000010	let's begin though the economy might seem complex it works in a simple mechanical way
YOU1000000115_S0000011	it's made up of a few simple parts and a lot of simple transactions that are repeated over and over again a zillion times
YOU1000000115_S0000012	these transactions are above all else driven by human nature and they create three main forces to drive the economy
YOU1000000115_S0000013	number one productivity growth number two the short term death cycle and number three the long term death cycle
YOU1000000115_S0000014	we'll look at these three forces and how laying them on top of each other creates a good template for tracking economic movements and figuring out what's happening now
YOU1000000115_S0000015	let's start with the simplest part of the economy transactions
YOU1000000115_S0000017	an economy is simply the sum of the transactions that make it up and a transaction is a very simple thing
YOU1000000115_S0000018	you make transactions all the time every time you buy something you create a transaction
YOU1000000115_S0000019	each transaction consists of a buyer exchanging money or credit with a seller for goods services or financial assets
YOU1000000115_S0000020	credit spends just like money so adding together the money spent and the amount of credit spent you could know the total spending
YOU1000000115_S0000021	the total amount of spending drives the economy
YOU1000000115_S0000022	if you divide the amounts spent by the quantity sold you get the price and that's it that's a transaction
YOU1000000115_S0000023	it's the building block of the economic machine
YOU1000000115_S0000024	all cycles and all forces in an economy are driven by transactions so if we can understand transactions we can understand the whole economy
YOU1000000115_S0000025	a market consists of all the buyers and all the sellers making transactions for the same thing
YOU1000000115_S0000026	for example there is a wheat market a car market the stock market and markets for millions of things
YOU1000000115_S0000027	an economy consists of all of the transactions in all of it's markets
YOU1000000115_S0000028	if you add up the total spending and the total quantity sold in the all of the markets you have everything you need to know to understand the economy
YOU1000000115_S0000029	it's just that simple
YOU1000000115_S0000030	people businesses banks and governments all engage in transactions the way i just described
YOU1000000115_S0000031	exchanging money and credit for goods services and financial assets
YOU1000000115_S0000032	the biggest buyer and seller is the government which consist of two important parts
YOU1000000115_S0000033	a central government that collects taxes and spends money and a central bank which is different from other buyers and sellers
YOU1000000115_S0000034	because it controls the amount of money and credit in the economy
YOU1000000115_S0000035	it does this by influencing interest rate and printing new money
YOU1000000115_S0000037	for these reasons as we'll see the central bank is an important player in the flow of credit
YOU1000000115_S0000038	i want you to pay attention to credit
YOU1000000115_S0000039	credit is the most important part of the economy and probably the least understood
YOU1000000115_S0000040	it's the most important part because it's the biggest and most volatile part
YOU1000000115_S0000042	just like buyers and sellers go to the market to make transactions so do lenders and borrowers
YOU1000000115_S0000043	lenders usually want to make their money in to more money and borrowers usually want to to buy something they can't afford
YOU1000000115_S0000044	like a house or a car or they want to invest in something like starting a business
YOU1000000115_S0000045	credit can help both lenders and borrowers get what they want
YOU1000000115_S0000046	borrowers promise to repay the amount they borrow called principle plus an additional amount called interest
YOU1000000115_S0000047	when interest rates are high there is less borrowing because it's expensive
YOU1000000115_S0000048	when interest rates are low borrowing increases because it's cheaper
YOU1000000115_S0000050	when borrowers promise to repay and lenders believe them credit is created
YOU1000000115_S0000052	any two people can agree to create credit out of thin air
YOU1000000115_S0000053	that seems simple enough but credit is tricky because it has different names
YOU1000000115_S0000054	as soon as credit is created it immediately turns in to debt
YOU1000000115_S0000055	debt is both an asset to the lender and a liability to the borrower
YOU1000000115_S0000057	in the future when the borrower repays the loan plus interest the asset and the liability disappear and the transaction is settled
YOU1000000115_S0000058	so why is credit so important
YOU1000000115_S0000060	because when a borrower receives credit he is able to increase his spending and remember spending drives the economy
YOU1000000115_S0000061	this is because one person's spending is another person's income
YOU1000000115_S0000062	think about it
YOU1000000115_S0000064	every dollar you spend someone else earns and every dollar you earn someone else has spent
YOU1000000115_S0000065	so when you spend more someone else earns more
YOU1000000115_S0000066	when someone's income rises it makes lenders more willing to lend him money because now he's more worthy of credit
YOU1000000115_S0000067	a creditworthy borrower has two things the ability to repay and collateral
YOU1000000115_S0000068	having a lot of income in relation to his debt gives him the ability to repay
YOU1000000115_S0000070	in the event that he can't repay he has valuable assets to use as collateral that can be sold this makes lenders feel comfortable lending him money
YOU1000000115_S0000071	so increased income allows increased borrowing which allows increased spending
YOU1000000115_S0000072	and since one person's spending is another person's income this leads to more increased borrowing and so on
YOU1000000115_S0000073	this self-reinforcing pattern leads to economic growth and is why we have cycles
YOU1000000115_S0000075	in a transaction you have to give something in order to get something and how much you get depends on how much you produce
YOU1000000115_S0000077	overtime we learn and that accumulated knowledge raises our living standards we call this productivity growth
YOU1000000115_S0000078	those who are inventive and hard-working raise their productivity and their living standards faster than those who are complacent and lazy
YOU1000000115_S0000079	but that isn't necessarily true over the short run
YOU1000000115_S0000080	productivity matters most in the long run but credit matters most in the short run
YOU1000000115_S0000081	this is because productivity growth doesn't fluctuate much so it's not a big driver of economic swings
YOU1000000115_S0000082	that is because it allows us to consume more than we produce when we acquire it and it forces us to consume less than we produce when we have to pay it back
YOU1000000115_S0000083	dead swings occur in two big cycles one takes about five to eight years and the other takes about seventy-five to a hundred years
YOU1000000115_S0000084	while most people feel the swings they typically don't see them as cycles because they see them too up close day by day week by week
YOU1000000115_S0000085	in this chapter we're going to step back and look at these three big forces and how they interact to make up our experiences
YOU1000000115_S0000086	as mentioned swings around the line are not due to how much innovation or hard work there is they are primarily due to how much credit there is
YOU1000000115_S0000087	let's for a second imagine an economy without credit in this economy the only way i can increase my spending is to increase my income
YOU1000000115_S0000088	which requires me to be more productive and do more work increased productivity is the only way for growth
YOU1000000115_S0000089	since my spending is another person's income the economy grows every time i or anyone else is more productive
YOU1000000115_S0000090	if we follow the transactions and play this out we see a progression like the productivity growth line but because we borrow we have cycles
YOU1000000115_S0000091	this isn't due to any laws or the regulations it's due to human nature and the way that credit works
YOU1000000115_S0000092	think of borrowing as simply a way of pulling spending forward in order to buy something you can't afford you need to spend more than you make
YOU1000000115_S0000093	to do this you essentially need to borrow from your future self in doing so you create a time in the future that you need to spend less than you make
YOU1000000115_S0000094	in order to pay it back it very quickly resembles a cycle basically anytime you borrow you create a cycle
YOU1000000115_S0000095	this is as true for an individual as it is for the economy
YOU1000000115_S0000096	this is why understanding credit is so important because it set into motion a mechanical predictable series of events that will happen in the future
YOU1000000115_S0000097	this makes credit different from money money is what you settle transactions with
YOU1000000115_S0000098	when you buy a beer from a bartender with cash the transaction is settled immediately
YOU1000000115_S0000099	but when you buy a beer with credit it's like starting a bar tab you're saying you promise to pay in the future
YOU1000000115_S0000100	together you and the bartender create an asset and a liability you just created credit out of thin air
YOU1000000115_S0000101	it's not until you pay the bar tab later that the asset and the liability disappear the debt goes away and the transaction is settled
YOU1000000115_S0000103	the reality is that most of what people call money is actually credit
YOU1000000115_S0000104	the total amount of credit in the united states is about fifty trillion dollars and the total amount of money is only about three trillion dollars
YOU1000000115_S0000105	remember in an economy without credit the only way to increase your spending is to produce more
YOU1000000115_S0000106	but in an economy with credit you can also increase your spending by borrowing
YOU1000000115_S0000107	as a result an economy with credit has more spending and allows incomes to rise faster than productivity over the short run but not over the long run
YOU1000000115_S0000108	now don't get me wrong credit isn't necessarily something bad that just causes cycles
YOU1000000115_S0000109	it's bad when it finances over-consumption that can't be paid back
YOU1000000115_S0000110	however it's good when it efficiently allocates resources and produces income so you can pay back the debt
YOU1000000115_S0000111	for example if you borrow money to buy a big t v it doesn't generate income for you to pay back the debt
YOU1000000115_S0000112	but if you borrow money to say buy a tractor
YOU1000000115_S0000114	and that tractor let's you harvest more crops and earn more money then you can pay back your debt and improve your living standards
YOU1000000115_S0000116	and in an economy with credit we can follow the transactions and see how credit creates growth
YOU1000000115_S0000118	let me give you an example suppose you earn a hundred thousand dollars a year and have no debt you are credit worthy enough to borrow ten thousand dollars
YOU1000000115_S0000119	say on a credit card so you can spend a hundred and ten thousand dollars even though you only earn a hundred thousand dollars
YOU1000000115_S0000120	since your spending is another person's income someone is earning a hundred and ten thousand dollars
YOU1000000115_S0000121	the person earning a hundred and ten thousand dollars with no debt can borrow eleven thousand dollars so he can spend a hundred and twenty-one thousand dollars
YOU1000000115_S0000122	even though he has only earned a hundred and ten thousand dollars
YOU1000000115_S0000123	his spending is another person's income and by following the transactions we can begin to see how this process works in a self reinforcing pattern
YOU1000000115_S0000124	but remember borrowing creates cycles and if the cycle goes up it eventually needs to come down
YOU1000000115_S0000125	this leads us in to the short-term debt cycle
YOU1000000115_S0000127	as economic activity increases we see an expansion the first phase of the short-term debt cycle
YOU1000000115_S0000128	spending continues to increase and prices start to rise
YOU1000000115_S0000129	this happens because the increase in spending is fueled by credit which can be created instantly out of thin air
YOU1000000115_S0000130	when the amount of spending and incomes grow faster than the production of goods prices rise
YOU1000000115_S0000131	when prices rise we call this inflation the central bank doesn't want too much inflation because it causes problems
YOU1000000115_S0000132	seeing prices rise it raises interest rates with higher interest rates fewer people can afford to borrow money
YOU1000000115_S0000133	and the cost of existing debts rises think about this as the monthly payments on your credit card going up
YOU1000000115_S0000135	because people borrow less and have higher debt repayments they have less money left over to spend so spending slows
YOU1000000115_S0000136	and since one person's spending is another person's income incomes drop and so on and so forth
YOU1000000115_S0000137	when people spend less prices go down we call this deflation economic activity decreases
YOU1000000115_S0000138	and we have a recession if the recession becomes too severe an inflation is no longer a problem
YOU1000000115_S0000139	the central bank will lower interest rates to cause everything to pick up again
YOU1000000115_S0000140	with low interest rates debt repayments are reduced and borrowing and spending pick up and we see another expansion
YOU1000000115_S0000141	as you can see the economy works like a machine
YOU1000000115_S0000142	in the short-term debt cycle spending is constrained only by the willingness of lenders and borrowers to provide and receive credit
YOU1000000115_S0000143	when credit is easily available there is an economic expansion when credit isn't easily available there is a recession
YOU1000000115_S0000144	and note that this cycle is controlled primarily by the central bank
YOU1000000115_S0000145	the short term debt cycle typically lasts five to eight years and happens over and over again for decades
YOU1000000115_S0000146	but notice that the bottom and top of each cycle finish with more growth than the previous cycle and with more debt
YOU1000000115_S0000147	why because people push it
YOU1000000115_S0000148	they have an inclination to borrow and spend more instead of paying back debt it's human nature
YOU1000000115_S0000149	because of this over long periods of time debts rise faster than incomes creating the long term debt cycle
YOU1000000115_S0000151	despite people becoming more indebted lenders even more freely extend credit
YOU1000000115_S0000153	why
YOU1000000115_S0000155	because everyone thinks things are going great people are just focused on what's been happening lately and what's been happening lately
YOU1000000115_S0000157	incomes have been rising asset values are going up the stock market roars it's a boom
YOU1000000115_S0000158	it pays to buy goods services and financial assets with borrowed money when people do a lot of that we call it a bubble
YOU1000000115_S0000159	so even though debts have been growing incomes have been growing nearly as fast to offset them let's call the ratio of debt to income the debt burden
YOU1000000115_S0000160	so long as incomes continue to rise the debt burden stays manageable at the same time asset values soar
YOU1000000115_S0000161	people borrow huge amounts of money to buy assets as investments causing their prices to rise even higher
YOU1000000115_S0000162	people feel wealthy
YOU1000000115_S0000164	so even with the accumulation of lots of debt rising incomes and asset values help borrowers remain credit-worthy for a long time
YOU1000000115_S0000165	but this obviously can not continue forever and it doesn't
YOU1000000115_S0000166	over decades debt burden slowly increase creating larger and larger debt repayments
YOU1000000115_S0000167	at some point debt repayments start growing faster than incomes forcing people to cut back on their spending
YOU1000000115_S0000168	and since one person's spending is another person's income incomes begin to go down which makes people less creditworthy
YOU1000000115_S0000170	causing borrowing to go down debt repayments continue to rise which makes spending drop even further
YOU1000000115_S0000171	and the cycle reverses itself
YOU1000000115_S0000173	this is the long term debt peak debt burdens have simply become too big
YOU1000000115_S0000175	for the united states europe and much of the rest of the world this happened in two thousand and eight
YOU1000000115_S0000176	it happened for the same reason it happened in japan in nineteen eighty-nine and in the united states back in nineteen twenty-nine
YOU1000000115_S0000177	now the economy begins the leveraging
YOU1000000115_S0000179	in a deleveraging people cut spending incomes fall credit disappears asset prices drop
YOU1000000115_S0000180	banks gets squeezed the stock market crashes social tensions rise and the whole thing starts to feed on itself the other way
YOU1000000115_S0000182	as incomes fall and debt repayments rise borrowers get squeezed no longer credit-worthy
YOU1000000115_S0000183	credit dries up and borrowers can no longer borrow enough money to make their debt repayments
YOU1000000115_S0000184	scrambling to fill this hole borrowers are forced to sell assets the rush to sell assets floods the market at the same time as spending falls
YOU1000000115_S0000185	this is when the stock market collapses the real estate market tanks and banks get into trouble
YOU1000000115_S0000186	as asset prices drop the value of the collateral borrowers can put up drops this makes borrowers even less creditworthy
YOU1000000115_S0000187	people feel poor credit rapidly disappears
YOU1000000115_S0000188	less spending less income less wealth less credit less borrowing and so on it's a vicious cycle
YOU1000000115_S0000189	this appears similar to a recession but the difference here is that interest rates can't be lowered to save the day
YOU1000000115_S0000190	in a recession lowering interest rates works to stimulate borrowing
YOU1000000115_S0000191	however in a deleveraging lowering interest rates doesn't work because interest rates are already low and soon hit zero percent so the stimulation ends
YOU1000000115_S0000193	interest rates in the united states hits zero percent during the deleveraging of the nineteen-thirties and again in two thousand and eight
YOU1000000115_S0000194	the difference between a recession and a deleveraging
YOU1000000115_S0000195	is that in a deleveraging borrowers debt burdens have simply gotten too big and can't be relieved by lowering interest rates
YOU1000000115_S0000196	lenders realize that debts have become too large to ever be fully paid back
YOU1000000115_S0000197	borrowers have lost their ability to repay and their collateral has lost value
YOU1000000115_S0000198	they feel crippled by the debt they don't even want more lenders stop lending borrowers stop borrowing
YOU1000000115_S0000199	think of the economy as being not credit-worthy just like an individual so what do you do about a deleveraging
YOU1000000115_S0000200	the problem is debt burdens are too high and they must come down
YOU1000000115_S0000201	there are four ways this can happen one people businesses and governments cut their spending
YOU1000000115_S0000202	two debts are reduced through defaults and restructurings three wealth is redistributed from the haves to the have nots
YOU1000000115_S0000203	and finally four the central bank prints new money these four ways have happened in every deleveraging in modern history
YOU1000000115_S0000205	usually spending is cut first as we just saw a people businesses and even governments tighten their belts and cut their spending so that they can pay down their debt
YOU1000000115_S0000206	this is often referred to as austerity when borrowers stop taking on new debts and start paying down the old debts
YOU1000000115_S0000207	you might expect the debt burden to decrease but the opposite happens because spending is cut
YOU1000000115_S0000208	and one man's spending is another man's income it causes incomes to fall
YOU1000000115_S0000209	they fall faster than debts are repaid and the debt burden actually gets worse as we've seen this cut in spending is deflationary and painful
YOU1000000115_S0000210	businesses are forced to cut costs which means less jobs and higher unemployment this leads to the next step debts must be reduced
YOU1000000115_S0000211	many borrowers find themselves unable to repay their loans and a borrower's debts are a lender's assets
YOU1000000115_S0000212	when a borrower doesn't repay the bank people get nervous that the bank won't be able to repay them so they rush to withdraw their money from the bank
YOU1000000115_S0000213	banks gets squeezed and people businesses and banks default on their debts
YOU1000000115_S0000214	this severe economic contraction is a depression
YOU1000000115_S0000215	a big part of a depression is people discovering much of what they thought was their wealth isn't really there
YOU1000000115_S0000216	let's go back to the bar when you bought a beer and put it on a bar tab you promised to repay the bartender
YOU1000000115_S0000217	your promise became an asset of the bartender
YOU1000000115_S0000218	but if you break your promise if you don't pay him back and essentially default on your bar tab then the asset he has isn't really worth anything
YOU1000000115_S0000219	it has basically disappeared
YOU1000000115_S0000221	many lenders don't want their assets to disappear and agree to debt restructuring
YOU1000000115_S0000222	debt restructuring means lenders get paid back less or get paid back over a longer time frame or at a lower interest rate than was first agreed
YOU1000000115_S0000223	somehow a contract is broken in a way that reduces debt lenders would rather have a little of something than all of nothing
YOU1000000115_S0000224	even though debt disappears debt restructuring causes income and asset values to disappear faster so the debt burden continues to get worse
YOU1000000115_S0000225	like cutting spending debt reduction is also painful and deflationary
YOU1000000115_S0000227	all of this impacts the central government because lower incomes and less employment means the government collects fewer taxes
YOU1000000115_S0000228	at the same time it needs to increase its spending because unemployment has risen
YOU1000000115_S0000229	many of the unemployed have inadequate savings and need financial support from the government
YOU1000000115_S0000230	additionally governments create stimulus plans and increase their spending to make up for the decrease in the economy
YOU1000000115_S0000231	government's budget deficits explode in a deleveraging because they spend more than they earn in taxes
YOU1000000115_S0000232	this is what's happening when you hear about the budget deficit on the news
YOU1000000115_S0000234	to fund their deficits governments need to either raise taxes or borrow money
YOU1000000115_S0000235	but with incomes falling and so many unemployed who is the money going come from
YOU1000000115_S0000236	the rich since governments need more money and since wealth is heavily concentrated in the hands of a small percentage of the people
YOU1000000115_S0000237	governments naturally raise taxes on the wealthy which facilitates a redistribution of wealth in the economy from the haves to the have-nots
YOU1000000115_S0000238	the have-nots who were suffering begin to resent the wealthy haves
YOU1000000115_S0000239	the wealthy haves being squeezed by the weak economy falling asset prices and higher taxes begin to resent the have-nots
YOU1000000115_S0000240	if the depression continues social disorder can break out
YOU1000000115_S0000241	not only detentions rise within countries they can rise between countries especially debtor and creditor countries
YOU1000000115_S0000242	this situation can lead to political change that can sometimes be extreme
YOU1000000115_S0000243	in the nineteen-thirties this led to hitler coming to power war in europe and depression in the united states
YOU1000000115_S0000244	pressure to do something to end the depression increases
YOU1000000115_S0000245	remember most of what people thought was money was actually credit so when credit disappears people don't have enough money
YOU1000000115_S0000246	people are desperate for money and you remember who can print money the central bank can
YOU1000000115_S0000248	having already lowered its interest rates to nearly zero it's forced to print money
YOU1000000115_S0000249	unlike cutting spending debt reduction and wealth redistribution printing money is inflationary and stimulative
YOU1000000115_S0000250	inevitably the central bank prints new money out of thin air and uses it to buy financial assets and government bonds
YOU1000000115_S0000251	it happened in the united states during the great depression
YOU1000000115_S0000252	and again in two thousand and eight when the united states central bank the federal reserve printed over two trillion dollars
YOU1000000115_S0000253	other central banks around the world that could printed a lot of money too
YOU1000000115_S0000254	by buying financial assets with this money it helps drive up asset prices which makes people more credit-worthy
YOU1000000115_S0000255	however this only helps those who own financial assets you see the central bank can print money but it can only buy financial assets
YOU1000000115_S0000256	the central government on the other hand can buy goods and services and put money in the hands of the people but it can't print money
YOU1000000115_S0000257	so in order to stimulate the economy the two must cooperate
YOU1000000115_S0000258	by buying government bonds the central bank essentially lends money to the government allowing it to run a deficit and increase spending
YOU1000000115_S0000259	on goods and services through it's stimulus programs and on employment benefits
YOU1000000115_S0000260	this increases people's income as well as the government's debt however it will lower the economy's total debt burden
YOU1000000115_S0000261	this is a very risky time policy makers need to balance the four ways that debt burdens come down
YOU1000000115_S0000263	the deflationary ways need to balance with the inflationary ways in order to maintain stability
YOU1000000115_S0000264	if balanced correctly there can be a beautiful deleveraging
YOU1000000115_S0000266	you see a deleveraging could be ugly or it can be beautiful how can a deleveraging be beautiful
YOU1000000115_S0000268	even though a deleveraging is a difficult situation handling a difficult situation in the best possible way is beautiful
YOU1000000115_S0000269	a lot more beautiful than the debt fueled unbalanced excesses of the leveraging phase
YOU1000000115_S0000270	in a beautiful deleveraging debts decline relative to income real economic growth is positive and inflation isn't a problem
YOU1000000115_S0000271	it is achieved by having the right balance the right balance requires a certain mix of cutting spending reducing debt
YOU1000000115_S0000273	transferring wealth and printing money so that economic and social stability can be maintained
YOU1000000115_S0000274	people ask if printing money will raise inflation it won't if it offsets fall in credit
YOU1000000115_S0000275	remember spending is what matters a dollar of spending paid for with money has the same effect on prices a dollar of spending paid for with credit
YOU1000000115_S0000277	by printing money the central bank can make up for the disappearance of credit with an increase in the amount of money
YOU1000000115_S0000278	in order to turn things around the central bank needs to not only pump up income growth
YOU1000000115_S0000279	but get the rate of income growth higher than the rate of interest on the accumulated debt
YOU1000000115_S0000280	so what do i mean by that basically income needs to grow faster than debt grows
YOU1000000115_S0000281	for example let's assume that a country going through a deleveraging has a debt to income ratio of a hundred percent
YOU1000000115_S0000282	that means that the amount of debt it has is the same as the amount of income the entire country makes in a year
YOU1000000115_S0000283	now think about the interest rate on that debt let's say it's two percent
YOU1000000115_S0000284	if debt is growing at two percent because of that interest rate and income is only growing at around one percent you will never reduce the debt burden
YOU1000000115_S0000285	you need to print enough money to get the rate of income growth above the rate of interest
YOU1000000115_S0000286	however printing money could easily be abused because it's so easy to do and people prefer it to the alternatives
YOU1000000115_S0000287	the key is to avoid printing too much money and causing unacceptably high inflation the way germany did during it's deleveraging in the nineteen-twenties
YOU1000000115_S0000288	if policy makers achieve the right balance a deleveraging isn't so dramatic growth is slow but debt burdens go down
YOU1000000115_S0000289	that's a beautiful deleveraging when incomes begin to rise borrowers begin to appear more credit-worthy
YOU1000000115_S0000290	and when borrowers appear more credit-worthy lenders begin to lend money again debt burdens finally begin to fall
YOU1000000115_S0000291	able to borrow money people can spend more eventually the economy begins to grow again leading to the reflation phase of the long-term debt cycle
YOU1000000115_S0000292	though the deleveraging process can be horrible if handled badly if handled well it will eventually fix the problem
YOU1000000115_S0000293	it takes roughly a decade or more for debt burdens to fall and economic activity to get back to normal hence the term lost decade
YOU1000000115_S0000294	enclosing of course the economy is a little bit more complicated than this template suggests
YOU1000000115_S0000295	however laying the short-term debt cycle on top of the long-term debt cycle and then laying both of them on top of the productivity growth line
YOU1000000115_S0000296	gives a reasonably good template for seeing where we've been where we are now and where we're probably headed
YOU1000000115_S0000297	so in summary there are three rules of thumb that i'd like you to take away from this
YOU1000000115_S0000298	first don't have debt rise faster than income because your debt burdens will eventually crush you
YOU1000000115_S0000299	second don't have income rise faster than productivity because you'll eventually become uncompetitive
YOU1000000115_S0000300	and third do all that you can to raise your productivity because in the long run that's what matters most
YOU1000000115_S0000301	this is simple advice for you and it's simple advice for policy makers
YOU1000000115_S0000302	you might be surprised but most people including most policy makers don't pay enough attention to this
YOU1000000115_S0000303	this template has worked for me and i hope it will work for you thank you
YOU1000000116_S0000000	as we begin our journey to the world of economics i thought i would begin with a quote from one of the most famous economist of all times
YOU1000000116_S0000001	the scottish philosopher adam smith and he really is kind of the first real economist in in the way that we view it now and this is from his
YOU1000000116_S0000002	the wealth of nations published in seventeen seventy-six coincidently the same year as the american declaration of independence
YOU1000000116_S0000003	and its one of his the most famous excerpts he generally indeed he being an economic actor neither intends to promote the public interest nor knows how much he is promoting it
YOU1000000116_S0000004	by directing that industry so the industry in control of that individual actor in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value he intends only his own gain
YOU1000000116_S0000005	he intends only his own gain and he is in this as in many other cases led by an invisible hand to promote an end
YOU1000000116_S0000006	which was no part of his intention and this term invisible hand is famous led by the invisible hand to promote an end
YOU1000000116_S0000007	which was no part of his attention he is saying look when individual actor just act in their own self-interest that often in aggregate leads to things that each of those individual actor did not intend
YOU1000000116_S0000008	and then he says nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it so its not always necessarily a bad thing by perusing his own interest
YOU1000000116_S0000009	he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it so this is a pretty strong statement
YOU1000000116_S0000010	its really at the core of capitalism and that's why i point out that it was published the same year as the american declaration of independence because obviously
YOU1000000116_S0000011	america the founding fathers they wrote the declaration of independence the constitution it really talks about what it means to be a democratic country what are the rights of its citizens
YOU1000000116_S0000012	but the united states in its overall ah ah the overall experience of an american is at least influenced by the work of adam smith
YOU1000000116_S0000013	by these kind of foundational ideas of capitalism and it just both happened to happen around the same time
YOU1000000116_S0000014	but this idea its not always that intuitive individual actors by ah by essentially perusing their own self-interested ends might be doing more for society
YOU1000000116_S0000015	then when they then if any of them actually try to promote the overall wellbeing of society and i don't think adam smith would say there's always good
YOU1000000116_S0000016	for someone to act self-interested or that its never good for people to actually think about the the implications of what they are doing to aggregate sense but he's saying that frequently
YOU1000000116_S0000017	frequently this self-interested action could lead to the greater good could lead to more innovation could lead to better investment
YOU1000000116_S0000018	could lead to more productivity could lead to more wealth more more ah a larger pie for everyone
YOU1000000116_S0000019	and now economists frequently and and when he makes a statement he's actually making a mix of a micro economic and macro economic statement
YOU1000000116_S0000020	micro is that people individual actors are acting in their own self-interest and the macro is that it might be good for the economy or for the nation as a whole
YOU1000000116_S0000021	and so now modern economist tend to divide themselves into these two schools or into these two subjects micro economics
YOU1000000116_S0000023	micro economics which was the study of individual actors micro economics those actors could be firms it could be people or could be households
YOU1000000116_S0000024	and you have macro economics which was the study of the economy and aggregate macro
YOU1000000116_S0000026	economics and you get it from their words
YOU1000000116_S0000027	micro the prefix refers to very small things macro refers to the larger the bigger picture and so micro economics just to re state is is essentially
YOU1000000116_S0000028	how actors actors make decisions make decisions or i guess we could say allocations allocations decisions slash
YOU1000000116_S0000029	allocations allocations of scarce resources and you're going to hear the word scarce resources a lot when people talk about economics
YOU1000000116_S0000030	and a scarce resources the one that you don't have an infinite amount of for example love might not be a scarce resource you might have an infinite amount of love
YOU1000000116_S0000031	but a resources that would be scarce is something like food or water or money or time or labour these are all scarce resources
YOU1000000116_S0000032	and so micro economics well how do people decide where to put those scarce resources how do they decide where to deploy them and how does that how does that affect prices and markets and whatever else
YOU1000000116_S0000033	macro economics is the study of of what happens in aggregate to an economy so aggregate what happens in aggregate
YOU1000000116_S0000034	to an economy from the millions of individual actors aggregate aggregate economy we have now have millions
YOU1000000116_S0000035	millions of actors and it often focuses on policy related questions so do you raise or lower taxes or what's going to happen when you raise or lower taxes
YOU1000000116_S0000036	do you regulate or deregulate how does that affect the overall proactivity when you do these so its policy
YOU1000000116_S0000037	top top down top down questions and in both macro and micro economics there is a there's a especially in the modern sense of it
YOU1000000116_S0000039	there is an attempt to make them rigorous to make them mathematical so in either case you can start with some of the ideas some of the philosophical ideas or the logical ideas
YOU1000000116_S0000040	to say someone like an adam smith might have so you have kind of you have these and ah they are basic ideas about about how people think how people make decisions
YOU1000000116_S0000041	so philosophy philosophy of of people of decision making in the case of in the case of micro economics decision making
YOU1000000116_S0000042	and then you'll make some assumptions about it or you'll simplify it so i'll do the right this you'll simplify it
YOU1000000116_S0000043	and you really are simplifying this you say ah all people are rational all people are gonna act in their own self-interest or all people are going to maximize the gain which isn't true
YOU1000000116_S0000044	human beings are motivated by a whole bunch of things but you simplify these things so that you can start to deal with it in a kind of mathematical way
YOU1000000116_S0000045	so you simplify it so you can start dealing it within at a mathematical sense so this is valuable it can not clarify your thinking it can not allow you to approve things
YOU1000000116_S0000046	to based on your assumptions and so that you can start to visualize things mathematically with charts and graphs and think about what will actually happen with markets
YOU1000000116_S0000047	so its very very valuable to have this mathematical rigorous thinking but at the same time it can be a little bit dangerous because you are making this huge simplification
YOU1000000116_S0000048	and sometimes the math might lead you to some very strong conclusions conclusions which you might feel very strongly about because it looks like you've prove you've proving them
YOU1000000116_S0000049	the same way that you might prove relativity but they were based on some some assumptions that either might be wrong or might be over simplifications or might not be relevant
YOU1000000116_S0000050	to the context that you're trying to make conclusions about so it's very very very important to take it all with the grain of thought to remember that its all based on some simplifying assumptions
YOU1000000116_S0000051	and macro economics is probably even more guilty of it in micro economics you're taking these deeply complicated things that human brain help people act and respond to each other
YOU1000000116_S0000052	and you're and then you're aggregating it over millions of people so its ultra complicated you have millions of these infinitely complicated people all interacting with each other so
YOU1000000116_S0000053	it's very complicated many millions of interactions and fundamentally unpredictable interactions and then trying to make assumptions on those
YOU1000000116_S0000054	trying to make assumptions and then doing and then doing math with that that could lead you to some conclusions or might lead you to some predictions
YOU1000000116_S0000055	and once again it's very important this is valuable it's valuable to make these mathematical ah models to make these mathematical assumptions these mathematical conclusions
YOU1000000116_S0000056	but always needs to be taken with a grain of salt and so that you have a proper grain of salt and so that you are always focused on the true intuition
YOU1000000116_S0000057	and that's really the most important thing to get from a course on of ah economics so that you can truly reason through what's likely to happen maybe even without the mathematics
YOU1000000116_S0000058	i'll leave you with two quotes and these quotes are a little bit they're a little bit funny but they're really i think are helpful things to keep in mind as you start especially go deep into the mathematical side
YOU1000000116_S0000059	of economics so this right over here is a quote by alfred knopf who was a publisher in who ah in the nineteen hundreds
YOU1000000116_S0000060	an economist as a man who states the obvious in terms of the incomprehensible and i'm assuming when he's talking about the incomprehensible he's referring to some of the mathy stuff that you see
YOU1000000116_S0000061	and economics and hopefully we'll make this as incomprehensible as as possible and see that there is value in this but its a very important statement he's making
YOU1000000116_S0000062	often times its stating a common sense thing its stating something that's obvious it's obvious and its very important to always keep that in mind
YOU1000000116_S0000063	to always make sure that you have the intuition for what's happening in the math or to know when the math is going in a direction that might be strange based on over simplification
YOU1000000116_S0000064	the wrong assumptions and then you have this quote over here by laurence j peter most famous for peter's principle professor at u s e
YOU1000000116_S0000065	an economist is an expert who will know tomorrow why the things he predicated yesterday didn't happen today and once again important to keep in the back of one's mind
YOU1000000116_S0000066	because especially and this is especially relevant to macro economics because in macro economics there's all sorts of a predictions about the state of the economy
YOU1000000116_S0000067	what needs to be done how long will the recession last what will be the economic growth next year what will inflation do and they often proved to be wrong
YOU1000000116_S0000068	in facts few economists even tend to agree on many of these saying and it's very important to realize that because often times when you are deep in the mathematics of the economics it might seem
YOU1000000116_S0000069	to be a science like physics but its not a science like physics there's open it is open to subjectivity
YOU1000000116_S0000070	and a lot of that subjectivity is all around is all around the assumptions that you choose to make
YOU1000000117_S0000000	alright i think we're at time so let's get started um welcome to folks i don't know i'm doctor laurie santos a professor here at yale university
YOU1000000117_S0000001	and the teacher of the science of well being course on coursera dot org and a host of the happiness lab podcast
YOU1000000117_S0000002	we wanted to do this facebook live event today because i know all of you are struggling with covid-nineteen
YOU1000000117_S0000003	and all the anxieties and the uncertainties that come with it ah we know of course all the physical things we need to do to protect our physical health right we should be washing our hands and socially distancing and so on
YOU1000000117_S0000004	but i think a lot of us are struggling right now with the kinds of things we should be doing to protect our mental health
YOU1000000117_S0000005	and we need to be just as intentional about protecting our own anxieties and depressions and sort of fixing that as we are protecting our physical health
YOU1000000117_S0000006	and this call today is to answer all your questions about that type of things that science suggest that we can do to promote our mental health in this challenging time
YOU1000000117_S0000007	what i'm gonna be doing is answering all of your questions so please be sending them in on the side
YOU1000000117_S0000008	um if you haven't yet sent us an emoji to let us know you are there please let us know
YOU1000000117_S0000009	um and i think since we have such a short time i think we're just gonna jump right into it
YOU1000000117_S0000010	um you'll see me kinda looking over at the side on my chat screen ah to see what the questions are
YOU1000000117_S0000011	and the first question we have today is from elizabeth who asks do you have any advice on dealing with reducing tension and arguing in your relationship during these stay at home orders
YOU1000000117_S0000012	and this one's a big one i think you're speaking to me i think a lot of us are facing the challenge right now
YOU1000000117_S0000013	that we're spending more time with our spouses with our partners with our kids
YOU1000000117_S0000014	and that can be incredibly challenging normally but it's especially challenging in other wise anxiety provoking time
YOU1000000117_S0000015	and so i think the first piece of advice i have is to just validate that like yeah this is a big thing we are all struggling with
YOU1000000117_S0000016	but then to sort of encourage everyone to be a little bit patient
YOU1000000117_S0000017	um the research on relationships it will allow relationships to succeed books like professor eli finkel and others
YOU1000000117_S0000018	they really suggest that a lot of our relationship's success has to to with our expectations
YOU1000000117_S0000019	and i think if anything we might wanna just be a little chiller about our expectations for our spouses than we might have been before
YOU1000000117_S0000020	all of us are going through the struggling time and so if you have a spouse who say you know didn't empty the dishwasher or isn't doing their part as much with kids
YOU1000000117_S0000021	i think this is a time to be compassionate both with them and with yourself
YOU1000000117_S0000022	and it's a kinda downgrade expectations a little bit
YOU1000000117_S0000023	but the particular advice i would give is if you think about relationship with your spouse there's always things that we really love about our spouse that ah ah in a relationship we do very very well together
YOU1000000117_S0000024	and this is the time to double down on those good things
YOU1000000117_S0000025	so if you both connect ah in term of hanging out with the kids and working with the kids that's the time to double down on life
YOU1000000117_S0000026	you both connect on humor you know now is the time to be watching a comedy movie together
YOU1000000117_S0000027	and so the basic advice is to kinda show them in yourself a little compassion like now is the time to kinda down regulate your expectations
YOU1000000117_S0000028	but also if there are things that are good in your relationship be very intentional about promoting those in this tough time
YOU1000000117_S0000029	and that sometimes requires a little creativity in of your ah you think you are great with with your spouses going out to dinner and having these wonderful outdoor dates
YOU1000000117_S0000030	you might need to get creative or with a little creativity you can really patch up a relationship
YOU1000000117_S0000031	and kind of down regulate the stress that we see
YOU1000000117_S0000032	remember in natural disaster as it is a time that we see things like divorce rates increasing
YOU1000000117_S0000033	but it's also the time that we see a new relationship's forming people making babies
YOU1000000117_S0000034	um it really depends on your intentional efforts you can make this challenging time better in your relationship
YOU1000000117_S0000035	so that was elizabeth's question next question we have up is from melissa
YOU1000000117_S0000036	um she asks how do we stay informed with current updated news without increasing our anxious feelings we may have
YOU1000000117_S0000037	ah this is another one i'm struggling with as well like like you i want to be informed about what's going on in my town you know what has the president said recently and so on
YOU1000000117_S0000038	but i feel like every time i watch the news i can watch my anxiety sky rocket
YOU1000000117_S0000039	um in terms of what anxiety feels like in the body for me that's watching my chest constrict and watching myself breath faster it just kinda doesn't feel good
YOU1000000117_S0000040	and so this is a real challenge of how to stay informed without creating more anxiety
YOU1000000117_S0000041	ah the way i have been able to solve it myself is to kinda do that paying attention that mindfulness about what the news is making me feel
YOU1000000117_S0000042	and there's time when it feels like information and there's time when it feels like i'm already really anxious
YOU1000000117_S0000043	i don't wanna add to that by adding any more news on to it
YOU1000000117_S0000044	and so i think the key is to just be really deliberate about what you are consuming
YOU1000000117_S0000045	and also we have some choice about what you are consuming you can pay attention to what's going on but try to up regulate the information about the positive news
YOU1000000117_S0000046	so for example there's a wonderful hashtag on twitter called covid kindness which you can use to check out to see all the good things that are happening out there
YOU1000000117_S0000047	and so i think trying to balance some of the doom and gloom that you are seeing and some of the positive things can be really powerful
YOU1000000117_S0000048	ah but but honestly what i have done my self is to really decrease the amount of news that i'm consuming
YOU1000000117_S0000049	um particularly before i go to bed i now have a rule like basically past six or seven p m
YOU1000000117_S0000050	i put my phone away i'm on social media as much i'm really trying to not be consuming the news at bed time
YOU1000000117_S0000051	cause i'm watching it mindfully and noticing that it's affecting my sleep
YOU1000000117_S0000052	um most of that information is gonna be there in the next morning and so find ways to protect your sleep and to pack protect your own anxiety levels
YOU1000000117_S0000053	and it's okay and be self-compassionate if you need to avoid some of that stuff
YOU1000000117_S0000054	again the twenty-four hour news cycle is gonna be back when you look again you're not gonna miss too much
YOU1000000117_S0000056	um so next question are are this comes from a a bunch of folks lee and jenna and anna are all asking similar questions about the mental health needs for frontline workers
YOU1000000117_S0000057	um they ask basically how can frontline workers and healthcare workers generally practice self-care and combat anxiety you know what what's the best way to support these workers
YOU1000000117_S0000058	um i'm so glad this question came up and it's great that it came up so from so many folks
YOU1000000117_S0000059	because this is something that i care about very deeply i'm so grateful that there are healthcare workers out there really risking their health and their lives
YOU1000000117_S0000060	to protect me and my family and my community so thank you with the gratitude for the fact that you are doing that
YOU1000000117_S0000061	i think there are a lots of intentional things that even folks around their frontline can do to protect their mental health in this scary time
YOU1000000117_S0000062	um one of those things comes from a refocus that you really need to protect you own mental health needs during this time
YOU1000000117_S0000063	and that means explicitly taking time to kinda of pay attention to your anxiety levels and watch the things you can do to deal with that
YOU1000000117_S0000064	i think in between patience if you can give yourself a break for it say three conscious breaths
YOU1000000117_S0000065	three very slow breaths where you breathe into your belly
YOU1000000117_S0000066	and just kinda of have a moment to take a second and be present
YOU1000000117_S0000067	um those things will down regulate your sympathetic nervous system that'll kick in the parasympathetic activity that we know allows for kind of your rest and digest
YOU1000000117_S0000068	and the more you can so take short breaks to do that all the more powerful
YOU1000000117_S0000069	i think a second thing i would say for healthcare workers is to make sure that you're reframing what you are doing in as positive a way as possible
YOU1000000117_S0000070	mean ultimately you're doing something that's incredibly brave that's helping folks that some times in the frantic day to day anxiousness of that you can lose that
YOU1000000117_S0000071	um and there's a lots of research by folks like david stenason and others that shows that taking time to realize that what you're doing is compassionately helping other people
YOU1000000117_S0000072	recognizing that it's a prosocial action can actually allow you a little bit more resilience in it can actually upregulate what's called your self-regulations your ability to do hard things
YOU1000000117_S0000073	and so i think kind of turning on your compassion muscles turning on this idea that you're doing something prosaically can be incredibly powerful
YOU1000000117_S0000074	and the final quick tip this is a more of a practice tip but for a healthcare workers right now is that
YOU1000000117_S0000075	there is lots of evidence that specific kinds of meditation practices can reduce burnout even in incredibly stressful times
YOU1000000117_S0000076	this is true for healthcare workers but also service providers and even folks like who work at at the grocery store who really have to give up and sacrifice right now to help other people
YOU1000000117_S0000077	and the specific kind of meditation is what's known as loving kindness meditation or matter
YOU1000000117_S0000078	it's basically a meditation practice where you work on practicing compassion you actually think about different people in your life
YOU1000000117_S0000079	and extend to them information about being happy and healthy
YOU1000000117_S0000080	you actually use a mantra of may you be happy may you be healthy
YOU1000000117_S0000081	but the research suggest that the simple act they're doing this even rarely temporarily can allow you to feel compassion this urge to help people without the empathy that goes with it
YOU1000000117_S0000082	in other words without the kind of burnout that comes from feeling those other people's emotions
YOU1000000117_S0000083	i think this can be an incredibly powerful technique for healthcare workers right now and you can start it today
YOU1000000117_S0000084	um lots of free apps online from inside timer to calm to even ten percent happier ah with dan harris there
YOU1000000117_S0000085	allowing the healthcare worker to use these things freely available
YOU1000000117_S0000086	and they're allowing those healthcare workers to access love and kindness meditation specifically
YOU1000000117_S0000087	so jump on and do one of these meditations even for five minutes in the morning you know when you're taking your shower
YOU1000000117_S0000088	it's the kind of thing that can really improve your ah kind of resilience and protect you from burnout later on
YOU1000000117_S0000089	okay so that was ah about healthcare workers now we have a new trust ah question from tracy
YOU1000000117_S0000090	tracy asks how do you keep yourself positive during this time when living alone when you're away from your family and friends
YOU1000000117_S0000091	ah i think this one is the the flip side of the question that was asked earlier about how to deal with the stress of living with your spouse
YOU1000000117_S0000092	there's a different kind of stress that comes from living alone and being away from family and friends in this really hard time
YOU1000000117_S0000093	i think the answer to this one is that you can be physically alone without being socially alone
YOU1000000117_S0000094	in other words you can be using technology to reach out to all those friends and family members
YOU1000000117_S0000095	and i think in this scary time we need to be doing this even more than ever and even more intentionally than ever
YOU1000000117_S0000096	you know it's one thing to kind of be home alone but it's another to know that you have you know zoom yoga classes with friend of yours
YOU1000000117_S0000097	or zoom dinner date with your parents who are far away in different time zones
YOU1000000117_S0000098	these are the kind of things you can built into your day even if you're living alone and i think that's really critical
YOU1000000117_S0000099	one thing to know is that the science suggest that the act of intentionally connecting in real time you know kind of how we're doing right now where i were i'm talking to you and you are hearing me in real time
YOU1000000117_S0000100	that can be almost just good as a regular social connection and we should be embracing these a lot more
YOU1000000117_S0000101	i think another thing you can do if you are living alone is to embrace the kinds of things that solitude gives you in term of other mental health benefits
YOU1000000117_S0000102	so i'm thinking about things like quite time for meditation
YOU1000000117_S0000103	or even alone time so that you can engage in a little bit more exercise you know
YOU1000000117_S0000104	grab a yoga mat even from a small apartment and do one of the many free online exercise classes that are coming now
YOU1000000117_S0000105	i think if you are alone in this crisis it can actually provide some time to reset things and focus on your own mental health
YOU1000000117_S0000106	in a way that might be tricky if you're not some sheltering in place in that very strange situation
YOU1000000117_S0000108	ah and so that was ah tracy's question now we're moving on to bree ah bree is asking how can we stay focused sane and productive at work
YOU1000000117_S0000109	particularly with the big elephant in the room which is the threat of layoffs
YOU1000000117_S0000110	ah this is another really huge one and i think i wanna start with this question first by validating it
YOU1000000117_S0000111	yeah a lot of us are facing the possibility of being laid off from work having less hours
YOU1000000117_S0000112	in addition to this physical height crises and this mental health crises a lot of us are facing a real economic crises and that's incredibly scary
YOU1000000117_S0000113	and so i think the first thing is to just have some self-compassion with yourself about the fact that we're going through this
YOU1000000117_S0000114	u i'm experiencing this now with many of my graduate and p h d students
YOU1000000117_S0000115	who feel like well they should be working and being just as productive as before but that can't possibly be true because we're in the midst of a pandemic where everyone is stressed
YOU1000000117_S0000116	and even if we're reacting to it really well one day that doesn't mean that the next day we were won't feel it really deeply and be unable to work
YOU1000000117_S0000117	and so i think the first piece of advice is just allow yourself some self-compassion
YOU1000000117_S0000118	you know give yourself the same self-compassion as you would give to a friend who is going to that sort of same thing
YOU1000000117_S0000119	all of us right now are gonna be a little less productive than usual
YOU1000000117_S0000120	um the second piece of advice is actually to remember some of the causal arrows you've heard about on the podcast and in my class
YOU1000000117_S0000121	in other words that we often think that productivity we need to figure it out first and then we'll be happy because we'll be productive at work
YOU1000000117_S0000122	but the research actually suggest the other arrow i know the words that by focusing on our mental health during this time it can actually increase our productivity
YOU1000000117_S0000123	and so that would be the direction i suggest you think about going what can you do to reduce your anxiety right now
YOU1000000117_S0000124	to bump up your social connection so you feel little bit more like connected and trusting about your community
YOU1000000117_S0000125	what you can you do to increase a little bit of exercise lately those type of things will bump up your mental health
YOU1000000117_S0000126	and by focusing on that you'll end up increasing your productivity exactly
YOU1000000117_S0000127	and so those would be my kind of productivity tips first of all just like it's not gonna be the same
YOU1000000117_S0000128	no one is gonna be the same and in a some ways the whole world is in this boat
YOU1000000117_S0000129	so kinda lay off yourself of the feel guilt a little bit because we're kinda all going through it
YOU1000000117_S0000130	and the second is that if you really wanna focus on productivity you need to give yourself some space to do the things that will really help your mental health too
YOU1000000117_S0000131	okay um so that was bree ah now we have a similar question from angela who's asked ah be more specifically i've been laid off because of covid-nineteen
YOU1000000117_S0000132	how do i do the soul searching necessary to figure out what i want to do next and what jobs and industries are gonna be fulfilling
YOU1000000117_S0000133	um i think again this is one of these ways of using the negative things in life to sort of see the blessings inside of them
YOU1000000117_S0000134	again you know losing your job is an awful thing to have happened and it comes with a lot of uncertainties
YOU1000000117_S0000135	but it also brings with it the possibility of new directions
YOU1000000117_S0000136	like you can start thinking more about what are the things that you found meaningful about your job
YOU1000000117_S0000137	what are the types of things that you are like to build into a job that's coming next
YOU1000000117_S0000138	again so many of us are in this crisis right now and going through these things
YOU1000000117_S0000139	but also all of us or most of us are gonna get through to the other side
YOU1000000117_S0000140	when we're in the crux of it it's hard to think that there's gonna be another side cause right now we are just facing uncertainty of kind of you know months inside and what does that mean
YOU1000000117_S0000141	well like all crises we're going to get to the other side
YOU1000000117_S0000142	and even those of you who are going to economic and other strives right now are going to find other options when you get out
YOU1000000117_S0000143	and i think you can use this time to do some real soul searching
YOU1000000117_S0000144	um one of the kinda blessings of being in a position of maybe losing your job or losing some hours at work
YOU1000000117_S0000145	is that you wind up having a time windfall you wind up having more time
YOU1000000117_S0000146	and that means that you can have the the blessing of having what's called time affluence that sort of feeling of being wealthy in time
YOU1000000117_S0000147	um if you can kinda get around the uncertainty of having the extra time it can actually be a really powerful time to do things like take time to journal about what you find most meaningful
YOU1000000117_S0000148	um or engage in the kinds of ah strategies that researches like amy reznitsky and other uses to job craft
YOU1000000117_S0000149	do you really think about what you find most meaningful in your work and sort of plan that moving forward
YOU1000000117_S0000150	um if you're taking the class angela i will also suggest this is a great time to go back to that strength test you might recall
YOU1000000117_S0000151	trying to focus on your character strengths and getting a sense of what those are that might be a good time to figure out what parts of your work are are mapping on to those strengths
YOU1000000117_S0000152	and if you're looking for work in the future what you could do with that kind of to to build those up and a even more robust way
YOU1000000117_S0000153	alright so that was the question from angela we are cruising through all these questions thank you so much for sending in all these great ones
YOU1000000117_S0000154	the next one up is from jessica and jessica notes i've been doing okay so far but one of my children has been really sad about missing school and his friends is there any way i can help him
YOU1000000117_S0000155	and again just start by just validating this you know this is a scary and uncertain and an anxiety provoking time for us
YOU1000000117_S0000156	it's so much worse for our children right who who really just don't have that kind of frontal lobe tools to regulate about this crisis
YOU1000000117_S0000157	and so i think anything you can do to help their anxiety their uncertainty can be incredibly powerful
YOU1000000117_S0000158	the first tip i would give for helping kids during this tough time is to make sure that they have a routine
YOU1000000117_S0000159	one of the problems about being out of school and out of the typical day that's kids face is that they are used to having a certain routine and now it's gone away
YOU1000000117_S0000160	and we as humans are creatures of habit like we can work best and feel less anxious when we're in a consistent schedule and a consistent routine
YOU1000000117_S0000162	so even if your kids aren't in a consistent schedule right now you should make one up for them
YOU1000000117_S0000163	you should find a way that you know like breakfast is from nine to ten and from ten to eleven
YOU1000000117_S0000164	you know you're doing your math homework or maybe you're watching cartoons or may be get to play video games it kinda doesn't matter
YOU1000000117_S0000165	but just have a consistent schedule that you end up and kind of announcing to your kids and sticking with
YOU1000000117_S0000166	ah the other piece of advice i would give is is again to to do the same thing that we need to do when we are feeling anxious and we are feeling stressed and we're feeling sad in other words the kinda same types of tips i was just talking about um
YOU1000000117_S0000167	kids too can benefit from having social connection through things like zoom and so on
YOU1000000117_S0000168	um for older kids that can be the same we do it as adults
YOU1000000117_S0000169	but even for younger kids that can be the kind of thing that you setup and structure
YOU1000000117_S0000170	um my colleague jamil zaki ah who is a social psychologist who was on the happiness lab podcast
YOU1000000117_S0000171	he has really younger kids and he knows that he and his friends are setting up clay dates over zoom
YOU1000000117_S0000172	they are kinda going online and printing out the same coloring pages so that kids can color together color the same thing
YOU1000000117_S0000173	across the way across zoom and that can be really powerful kinda giving the structure of social connection back to your kids when they need it
YOU1000000117_S0000174	um but another thing to build in i think would be to allow kids to see that again this isn't all doom and groom
YOU1000000117_S0000175	if you look like there are heroes and real stories of kindness out there
YOU1000000117_S0000176	and so another tip would be to kinda expose your kids to the fact that there are good things happening
YOU1000000117_S0000177	um have tell them your stories about covid kindness that you're reading about in the news
YOU1000000117_S0000178	talk to them about the heroes that are doing great things
YOU1000000117_S0000179	um and then allow them to experience the fact that there is good stuff out there as well
YOU1000000117_S0000180	i think the third and final tip is that you know you being the head of the house are going to have a huge emotional impact on your kids
YOU1000000117_S0000181	um we if you listened for past episodes of the happiness lab you've heard about cases of emotional contagion
YOU1000000117_S0000182	and the fact that we are often part of these effective spirals
YOU1000000117_S0000183	where one member of our team or families feels a certain way feels panicky and in that panic can be contiguous and it transmits and it gets worse
YOU1000000117_S0000184	remember that you can be the calm in the storm for your kids you know if you take time to regulate your own anxiety you know do your own deep breaths before you face them
YOU1000000117_S0000185	if you're describing this part of this situation as a challenge not a crisis you are going to transmit that calm and that those positive states to them
YOU1000000117_S0000186	and that can be incredibly important you know one of the best things you can do right now to help you community is to be embodying those positive emotions yourself
YOU1000000117_S0000187	and that often needs doing the right things to protect your own well being the kinds of things that we have been talking about
YOU1000000117_S0000188	okay ah so that's one was from jessica now we are moving on to one from lindsey
YOU1000000117_S0000189	um lindsey asks in your course we learned about how experiences and not things make us happy
YOU1000000117_S0000190	in this time of social distending and self-quarantine are there any suggestions you have for experiences we could create independently or with our families
YOU1000000117_S0000191	um i love this question inquired because it's you know doing all the things that i suggest right which is like being proactive
YOU1000000117_S0000192	you know using the the topics that we have heard about in the course and interventions we have seen in the course in this special time
YOU1000000117_S0000193	i think one of the odd but great things about this current time is that we are all in a new situation
YOU1000000117_S0000194	like we are all faced with being at home in a way we haven't been before we have more time with our kids more time with our families and things like that
YOU1000000117_S0000195	all the research and psychology suggest that we can harness these new situations to form new different habits
YOU1000000117_S0000196	in other words we can start things that we hadn't tried before you know new game nights new family dinners new traditions
YOU1000000117_S0000197	all these things because we are in this moment where we start a new situation
YOU1000000117_S0000198	are easy the harness we can harness what i called the fresh starts ah which is ah some wonderful research by katie milkman and others
YOU1000000117_S0000199	shows that these new situations and these new moments of fresh starts allow us to form habits better
YOU1000000117_S0000200	and so i think this is the time to think about what creative experience is you could come up with with your family
YOU1000000117_S0000201	you know well maybe you start cooking dinner with your family in a different way maybe you start zooming you know grandma and grandpa into your zoom meetings
YOU1000000117_S0000202	well maybe you all engage in a yoga class or some crazy exercise together
YOU1000000117_S0000203	maybe this is the time to start that gratitude you know three good things that you list before dinner with your family
YOU1000000117_S0000204	all these things are easier to start their experiences that are easier to get going
YOU1000000117_S0000205	cause we don't really have norms that our families are supposed to do during this time it's so new
YOU1000000117_S0000206	and that provides this real opportunity if you can harness it to put good things in place for yourself and for your family
YOU1000000117_S0000207	and so i think before those experiences you know get really creative and and that can be with your kids but it can also with your spouses
YOU1000000117_S0000208	um you know we can't necessarily go out on the typical boring dinner dates or go to that same restaurant you went to every single week
YOU1000000117_S0000209	so try something new whether that's you know a a new like spot in a house to have the dinner a new candle like put down a table clock like try a new meal like
YOU1000000117_S0000210	you can create these novel experiences and if you frame these things as novel experiences that can be powerful for your well being as well
YOU1000000117_S0000211	okay so that was lindsey's question moving on where we're really scrolling through some intruding you again to send in you questions if you hadn't yet we have about ten more minutes in this chat so send them in
YOU1000000117_S0000212	um next question comes from sheryl and sheryl asks what should we do about sleep problems i can't sleep anxiety uncertainty et-cetera
YOU1000000117_S0000213	um sheryl you are really speaking to me because i was going through this pretty badly ah about last week
YOU1000000117_S0000214	when i was just realizing that i just was unable to kinda fall asleep
YOU1000000117_S0000215	you know even though i was trying to get out of bed at a reasonable hour you know my mind was like
YOU1000000117_S0000217	it was really really hard
YOU1000000117_S0000219	and so i'll share with you the things that i've done to promote sleep and they are all things that come from the research
YOU1000000117_S0000220	um one of these is to harness the power of ritual before you go to sleep
YOU1000000117_S0000221	um there's lots of fantastic work by mike norton and francesco jino showing the power of ritual to control things when things feel out of control
YOU1000000117_S0000222	um and i think right now you know one of the things that's preventing us from sleeping is that every thing feels really out of control
YOU1000000117_S0000223	and so i was started some you know seemingly dumb like private sleep rituals you know i kinda setup at night and kinda remake my bed if my bed wasn't made before
YOU1000000117_S0000224	um i have found out the all like lotions that i have you know in my cabinet that i haven't used in a while
YOU1000000117_S0000225	like every night before i go to bed i kinda like you know put some lotion on and try to be really mindful about the way it smells and the way it feels and kinda get into bed it sounds really silly
YOU1000000117_S0000226	by harnessing this ritual the science suggest can kinda make you feel a little bit more in control
YOU1000000117_S0000227	and it can also train your body that like oh wait after i do the ritual the lotion then i go to bed
YOU1000000117_S0000228	and second thing that i've done and this is probably then even more powerful is to really regulate how much anxiety provoking material i'm looking at right before i go to bed
YOU1000000117_S0000229	um i know i've told lots of view about the the danger of phones and particularly the dangers of phones right before you go to sleep
YOU1000000117_S0000230	but this is a time where we really need to be following that advice
YOU1000000117_S0000231	ah basically i have a rule now that after eight p m i put my phone away i just put it on silent
YOU1000000117_S0000232	i put it in a specific spot in my bedroom and i'm not allowed to use it anymore
YOU1000000117_S0000233	ah which is tricky for me because i'm really use to kinda scrolling and using my phone before i go to bed
YOU1000000117_S0000234	but i've tried to substitute that habit with something else because as we know from our habit research ah if you have a queue but no action to do it can be really hard to overcome a bad habit from before
YOU1000000117_S0000235	and so my new ah my new habit when i have the queue like i really wanna check my phone before bed is a physical book i've just found old books at my house that i either wanna read or sitting on that shelf and have a had a chance to yet and those are there
YOU1000000117_S0000236	and so those different habits of kinda beginning a sort of sleep ritual it's like healthier
YOU1000000117_S0000237	and getting rid of the phone which is bad because if it's a lie but also because on the other hand that phone right now has a lot of anxiety provoking content that can be really powerful for me
YOU1000000117_S0000238	and i guess maybe the third thing is just to prioritize it
YOU1000000117_S0000239	um i've been trying to you know given that we all have a little bit many of us has a little bit more flexibility with our work time
YOU1000000117_S0000240	i've been really trying to move any work meeting that are early in the morning to a little bit later
YOU1000000117_S0000241	so even if i can't get to sleep or i'm having some restless sleep i'll have a little bit more time to make it up these days
YOU1000000117_S0000242	and so highly highly encourage you to prioritize sleep remember sleep essential for your mental health but it's also one of the other thing you can do right now to protect your immune function
YOU1000000117_S0000243	during a time when we all really need to make sure our immune function is as high and as effective as it can possibly be
YOU1000000117_S0000244	okay so up next question ah marasa is here and she is asking
YOU1000000117_S0000245	i've a couple of family members that have tested positive for covid-nineteen i feel like my mind is focused only on that so how do you suppose i go about my day with caring for my family but also taking care of my own mental health
YOU1000000117_S0000246	i think this is again i'll start by doing i think what's important here which is to validate this
YOU1000000117_S0000247	um many of us are going through the situation where we know people who are positive for covid-nineteen or presume positive for covid-nineteen and get different scarier situation you know can't get tested
YOU1000000117_S0000248	um and that's incredibly scary and sometimes that comes with the additionally awful thing that um if you are trying to physically distance yourself or if you're in a vulnerable position yourself
YOU1000000117_S0000249	you might not even be able to to help them in the normal way because you might need to maintain some distance from them
YOU1000000117_S0000250	and so i think the first thing to do with this is to have some self-compassion this is unprecedentedly bad situation
YOU1000000117_S0000251	and you kinda just need to be nice to yourself and stop feeling guilty
YOU1000000117_S0000252	um if you're in the position where you want to be helping your family members and are feeling frustrated that you can't interact with them directly
YOU1000000117_S0000253	this is for people who for example have family members who are faraway or family members who are vulnerable who we can't get to
YOU1000000117_S0000254	i think one thing the research suggest you can do to help with that is to allow those person to urges to come out another way and there are other elderly family members you can help
YOU1000000117_S0000255	or something else you can do that's doing good in the world even if you can't do good for that one person i think that can be particularly powerful
YOU1000000117_S0000256	um but in terms of just gonna going to that situation with them remember i think part of it is to find ways to reduce your own sympathetic nervous system activity
YOU1000000117_S0000257	i think the stress of having family members who are sick on our own bodies can be incredibly anxiety provoking
YOU1000000117_S0000258	and i think you need to just take time to kinda breathe and again which after a little bit before about kinda doing these slower breaths these belly breaths we talking a lot about on our podcast and things
YOU1000000117_S0000259	but that's the time to do that sort of deep breathing and again that's useful
YOU1000000117_S0000260	because it's going to help your of own immune function it's gonna some shut off that fight or flight sympathetic nervous acts system activity
YOU1000000117_S0000261	and allow you to turn on that's parasympathetic nervous activity which is what we need right now to sort of rest and digest and now will help your immune function
YOU1000000117_S0000262	but it'll also give you the bandwidth to deal with that stressful situation
YOU1000000117_S0000263	remember even if it doesn't feel like it there's a lot that you can do to embody calm yourself in order to help the other people in your life
YOU1000000117_S0000264	and so very very hard and scary situation completely validating that
YOU1000000117_S0000265	but it can know that there's simple action you can take to kinda take control of your own emotions and sort of work with them even in this really scary time
YOU1000000117_S0000267	final question cause we are hurry out of time ah our final question comes from holly
YOU1000000117_S0000268	who asks ah that her question is around trying to do random acts of kindness and make social connections during this time
YOU1000000117_S0000269	she has a few ideas in mind but it's hard to find ways in everyday life when you are in isolation to do this more
YOU1000000117_S0000270	um agree completely you know in in that in the course in on the podcast we talk a lot about these
YOU1000000117_S0000271	kinda random social connections you know the chatting with the barista social connections that happened ah regularly you know this is the stuff that went missing more and more now
YOU1000000117_S0000272	and so one of the tips i've been giving is to try to build in social connection that's not the like very formal conference call with the folks at work but really informal type things
YOU1000000117_S0000273	you know like i'm gonna do a yoga class um just like call you know text a few friends and say who a hey who wants to jump in with me
YOU1000000117_S0000274	or i'm gonna have a half hour where i'm chopping vegetables and trying to deal with whatever's in my pantry to cook tonight
YOU1000000117_S0000275	ah let me see if i can zoom a friend who can jump in with me then
YOU1000000117_S0000276	i think these informal social interactions can be incredibly powerful
YOU1000000117_S0000277	we have to intentionally build them in in a way that we didn't before but two things there one is that just takes a little bit more work
YOU1000000117_S0000278	and the second thing is if you form the right habit now you might be able to import that later
YOU1000000117_S0000279	so that when this whole crisis is over you are doing those things as well
YOU1000000117_S0000280	in terms of the the random acts of kindness part i think there are so many things we can be doing to reach out to others
YOU1000000117_S0000281	one is just to recognize that this act of sheltering in place staying home is a pro-social action you are helping other people and helping to flatten the curve
YOU1000000117_S0000282	maybe saving a thousands of lives by your simple actions so make sure you reframe it that way
YOU1000000117_S0000283	but the other thing is to use whatever windfalls you have whether that's extra time cause you are not working as much
YOU1000000117_S0000284	or little financial windfall you know those of you who aren't paying gas to commute or buying that coffee at the coffee shop regularly that you normally buy
YOU1000000117_S0000285	those are little financial windfalls that you can use to help other people
YOU1000000117_S0000286	and so what can you use to to use that money to say help local businesses who need some help or if you just have extra time what can you do to kinda contact elderly family members who might need a connection right now
YOU1000000117_S0000287	or even talk to your congress people about what they should be doing like these are the times when we can use our temporal windfalls our times windfalls to help other people alive
YOU1000000117_S0000288	okay i think that was a lot i hope that you heard some fantastic suggestions
YOU1000000117_S0000289	um i want you to keep in mind the the main thing that i keep mentioning which is self-compassion
YOU1000000117_S0000290	this is a really challenging time and it's important to be nice to yourself
YOU1000000117_S0000291	but one of the things you can do to be nice to yourself is to remember what science suggests about the kinds of things that can improve your wellbeing
YOU1000000117_S0000292	um we know that you are washing your hands doing good stuff for your physical health i hope this is giving you a bunch of tips for what you can do for your mental health too
YOU1000000117_S0000293	um there are so many comments on there sending gratitude my way thank you so much you are very welcome
YOU1000000117_S0000294	i hope this is giving you some useful tips and i thank you for signing on thank you all so much
YOU1000000118_S0000001	we start this specialization with this course
YOU1000000118_S0000002	how google does m l where i introduce machine learning and what google means when we say we are a i first
YOU1000000118_S0000003	my colleague josh then comes in to talk about the strategy of machine learning
YOU1000000118_S0000004	we end with a discussion of two link of how to do machine learning at scale using python notebooks and server less data processing components
YOU1000000118_S0000006	now if you are an engineer or a scientist you'll probably thinking that this all too high level
YOU1000000118_S0000007	and you're ready to jump to the next course which starts to delve into technical details of tensor flow but before you make that decision let me tell you something
YOU1000000118_S0000008	when we taught this set of courses to our customers
YOU1000000118_S0000009	one remark that often came back was that the module by josh was the one they revisited the most often
YOU1000000118_S0000011	after they went back to work six months later the module that they went to to look at the most wasn't the strategy of machine learning
YOU1000000118_S0000012	so you want to get the big picture before you delve into that technical details
YOU1000000118_S0000013	because the big picture is very important for you to be able to get by end from the rest of the organization to carry out
YOU1000000118_S0000014	we then move on to doing machine learning with tensorflow that involves two aspects
YOU1000000118_S0000015	one creating a good machine-learning dataset and two building your first machine-learning model with tensor flow
YOU1000000118_S0000016	creating a machine learning dataset is another of those practical modules that you don't want to ignore
YOU1000000118_S0000017	when you create a machine-learning model and it works well in your experiments but then fails miserably in production
YOU1000000118_S0000018	the reason will often comeback to how you created the machine-learning dataset so give yourself time to absorb the lessons
YOU1000000118_S0000019	and then we have two courses that are about improving machine-learning accuracy
YOU1000000118_S0000020	as you build your first machine learning model you will learn that they are lots of things we can do to improve that model
YOU1000000118_S0000021	so think of this section as filling your tool chest with the set of ideas
YOU1000000118_S0000022	you'll use different ideas in different situations so you'll find that knowing them will be helpful in your career as you solved different machine learning problems
YOU1000000118_S0000023	and as before it's not enough to just name check these concepts you need to give yourself time to understand them
YOU1000000118_S0000024	and know how to implement them in code we then move on to set of courses that are about operationalizing the machine learning model
YOU1000000118_S0000025	as i mentioned earlier operationalizing a machine learning model
YOU1000000118_S0000026	and by that i mean training it at scale in a distributed way serving out the predictions
YOU1000000118_S0000027	building a machine learning model end to end operationalizing a machine learning model can be super hard
YOU1000000118_S0000028	it is a stage where most enterprise machine learning projects fail
YOU1000000118_S0000029	i cannot tell you how many companies i've talked to who've said their innovation teams had devised these cool m l projects but they were struggling getting the m l models into production
YOU1000000118_S0000030	in this set of courses we will talk about how to train deploy and predict with m l models in a way that they're production ready
YOU1000000118_S0000031	and finally we delve back into machine learning theory but theory in big air coats
YOU1000000118_S0000032	machine learning theory is mostly heuristics machine learning is an intensely heuristic discipline
YOU1000000118_S0000033	and you're only as good as your bag of tools and tricks
YOU1000000118_S0000034	so we'll introduce a number of tools and tricks that work with the inputs to your machine learning models or images
YOU1000000118_S0000036	tools and tricks that help when you are processing or outputting sequences
YOU1000000118_S0000037	and sequences in machine learning can be either time series data or text data
YOU1000000118_S0000038	and finally we will look at several ways to build powerful recommendation systems
YOU1000000118_S0000039	recommendation systems are how you've build personalized algorithms
YOU1000000118_S0000040	and so it's something that most m l engineers build at some point in their careers
YOU1000000118_S0000041	in fact it might be the only m l system that many people will built
YOU1000000118_S0000042	but in order to built powerful recommendation engines it turns out that you need to understand tools and tricks
YOU1000000118_S0000043	that are borrowed from images and from sequences
YOU1000000118_S0000044	so that's why we are looking at them at this order and that's why we look at recommendation engines pretty much at the end of the specialization
YOU1000000118_S0000045	now you may have encountered some of the this material before especially in the first four courses
YOU1000000118_S0000046	for example in the courses i'm creating machine learning datasets
YOU1000000118_S0000047	and on tensorflow basics some of the slides will be a repeat of server less machine learning with tensorflow that's available on coursera
YOU1000000118_S0000048	similarly if you encounter google's machine learning crash course this is an internal google course but it has also been taught on some university campuses
YOU1000000118_S0000049	you might find some of the material and feature representation and art and science of m l to be familiar
YOU1000000118_S0000051	in spite of this though the details are quite different so don't skip it completely
YOU1000000118_S0000052	treat these courses as a useful refresher and make sure that you'll still remember the ideas presented in those sections
YOU1000000119_S0000001	welcome to the first course of the blockchain specialization title blockchain basics
YOU1000000119_S0000002	let's start by asking ourselves what is a blockchain why should you care about it
YOU1000000119_S0000003	unlike traditional methods blockchain enables peer to peer transfer of digital assets without any intermediaries
YOU1000000119_S0000004	it was a technology originally created to support the famous cryptocurrency bitcoin
YOU1000000119_S0000005	the blockchain by itself has taken a life of its own and permeated a broad range of applications across many industries including finance healthcare government manufacturing and distribution
YOU1000000119_S0000006	the blockchain is poised to innovate and transform a wide range of applications including goods transfer for example supply chain digital media transfer for example sale of art
YOU1000000119_S0000007	remote services delivery example travel and tourism platform for decentralized business logic for example moving computing to data sources
YOU1000000119_S0000008	and distributed intelligence example education credential
YOU1000000119_S0000009	additional applications of blockchain include distributed resources for example power generation and distribution
YOU1000000119_S0000010	crowd funding for example startup fund raising crowd operation for example electronic voting identity management for example one i d for all your life's functions
YOU1000000119_S0000011	and government public records and open governing
YOU1000000119_S0000013	moreover blockchain can enable an inclusive economy it can enable a person in a remote corner of the world to partake in a democratic process
YOU1000000119_S0000014	opportunities for innovative applications are endless
YOU1000000119_S0000015	that is a dire need for critical thinkers designers and developers who can envision and create newer application models on blockchain to benefit the world
YOU1000000119_S0000016	this course is a first step in addressing this need
YOU1000000119_S0000017	at the end of this course you will be able to explain the three fundamental characteristic that define the blockchain using bitcoin blockchain
YOU1000000119_S0000018	bitcoin is not the only player in town by the end of the first module we'll move beyond bitcoin into introducing the next generation blockchains with ethereum
YOU1000000119_S0000020	you will also be able to discuss the important features of ethereum blockchain that is used as a reference implementation in many newer blockchain
YOU1000000119_S0000021	and explain the algorithms and techniques that enable the blockchain including a public cryptography and hashing
YOU1000000119_S0000022	finally you will be able to outline methods for realizing trust in a blockchain
YOU1000000119_S0000024	let's begin with an introduction of bitcoin
YOU1000000119_S0000025	two major contributions of cryptocurrency bitcoin are a continuously working digital currency system and a model for autonomous decentralized application technology called a blockchain
YOU1000000119_S0000027	though our focus is on a general blockchain we have to understand the working of the technology behind bitcoin to fully appreciate the innovation of blockchain
YOU1000000119_S0000029	we can all agree that the advent of the internet and the world wide web has transformed every aspect of our lives from stock markets to street corner food trucks
YOU1000000119_S0000030	it has enabled the technology explosion with web two point o and the world of e-commerce applications
YOU1000000119_S0000031	around two thousand eight two thousand nine when the institutions and markets we trusted were crumbling down and everybody was running away from the wall street
YOU1000000119_S0000032	a mysterious person or persons called satoshi nakamoto introduced a new digital currency a cryptocurrency called bitcoin
YOU1000000119_S0000034	bitcoin enabled an innovative platform for peer to peer transfer of value without any central authority
YOU1000000119_S0000036	with no central authority how did bitcoin realize trust and security
YOU1000000119_S0000037	by implementing software programs for validation verification consensus in a novel infrastructure called the blockchain
YOU1000000119_S0000039	later on in about in twenty-twelve twenty-thirteen computational elements were added to the blockchain infrastructure
YOU1000000119_S0000040	that has opened up a whole world of possibilities beyond simple currency transfer
YOU1000000119_S0000041	these innovations are significantly shaping the direction of web three point o as you will learn in the next four courses
YOU1000000119_S0000043	what is a blockchain blockchain is about enabling peer to peer transaction in a decentralized network
YOU1000000119_S0000044	establishing trust among unknown peers
YOU1000000119_S0000045	recording the transaction in an immutable distributed ledger
YOU1000000119_S0000047	let's understand centralized versus decentralized network using a common scenario
YOU1000000119_S0000048	consider a scenario where a customer wants to buy an item using her credit card
YOU1000000119_S0000050	let's enumerate the intermediaries involved in accomplishing this task
YOU1000000119_S0000051	we have a credit card agency we have a customer bank we have a credit card's bank we have an exchange we have the merchant's bank and finally the merchant
YOU1000000119_S0000053	this is an example of a centralized system that we are so used to
YOU1000000119_S0000054	now compare this with a system where peers can transact directly with each other irrespective of where they are located
YOU1000000119_S0000056	functions of the intermediaries are shifted to the periphery to the peer participant in the blockchain infrastructure
YOU1000000119_S0000057	peers are not necessarily known to each other this is a decentralized system
YOU1000000119_S0000058	how do we establish trust among the peers in such a decentralized system
YOU1000000119_S0000059	by having a process and place to validate verify and confirm transactions
YOU1000000119_S0000060	record the transaction in the distributed ledger of blocks
YOU1000000119_S0000061	create a tamper-proof record of blocks chain of blocks
YOU1000000119_S0000063	and implement a consensus protocol for agreement on the block to be added to the chain
YOU1000000119_S0000064	so validation verification consensus and immutable recording lead to the trust and security of the blockchain
YOU1000000119_S0000066	now i will explain these concepts using another scenario
YOU1000000119_S0000068	i am lending amy ten-thousand dollars this is one single peer to peer transaction
YOU1000000119_S0000069	we both make a note of it on a ledger
YOU1000000119_S0000070	what if i change my entry from ten-thousand to eleven-thousand
YOU1000000119_S0000071	alternatively amy changes hers from ten-thousand to one-thousand
YOU1000000119_S0000072	to prevent this trust violation we need to seek the help of people around us lisa allison and francis
YOU1000000119_S0000073	provide all of them a valid copy of this ledger
YOU1000000119_S0000074	this is the basic concept of an immutable distributed ledger defined in a blockchain process
YOU1000000119_S0000076	in this scenario we were all physically present in one location amherst
YOU1000000119_S0000077	now imagine this to be an online transaction
YOU1000000119_S0000078	to an unknown peer also scale up the one transaction to ten-thousand transactions how about a million transactions
YOU1000000119_S0000079	i should be able to transact with equal ease to any unknown peer in amherst albany or albania
YOU1000000119_S0000080	maybe to send some flowers to a friend in albania this is the tenant of a decentralized system supported by blockchain
YOU1000000119_S0000082	in the case just described how do we trust our unknown peers
YOU1000000119_S0000083	through verification and validation in our example amy request kevin to verify the amount i transacted with her
YOU1000000119_S0000085	kevin checks it oops kevin finds that amount transaction is not ten-thousand but three-hundred not valid
YOU1000000119_S0000086	kevin rejects and nullifies the transaction similar to this validation when verification methods define by the blockchain
YOU1000000119_S0000087	and implemented by the peers provide the collect to trust needed in a decentralized system
YOU1000000119_S0000088	summarizing blockchain technology supports methods for a decentralized peer to peer system a collective trust model
YOU1000000119_S0000089	and the distributed immutable ledger of records of transactions
YOU1000000120_S0000001	i'm back
YOU1000000120_S0000003	how's it going guys to everyone at king's langley school i hope you're well
YOU1000000120_S0000005	i came to king's langley school when i was a teenager my name's anthony joshua and i know how tough it is for you guys right now at home i know you're doing your lessons live
YOU1000000120_S0000006	i commend you i know it's not easy but your commitment will pay off but it's also important to keep yourself active keep the mind active and keep the body active mister fisher's actually employed me
YOU1000000120_S0000007	so i've come down here especially this morning to put in my time and give you a workout plan i was actually taught by mister annette i know he's got a hit class for you guys
YOU1000000120_S0000008	so mister annette make sure you warm up you cool down because you're definitely going to be sore tomorrow
YOU1000000120_S0000009	but i just wanna say how privileged you guys are to have teachers who care and love and support you ah that are actually on this journey with you it's not only just for you
YOU1000000120_S0000010	your brothers your sisters your aunties your uncles mums and dads this is for everyone to get involved and keep active
YOU1000000120_S0000011	i may not be the joe wicks of the industry actually tied him up and he's in the corner i'm just joking i'm just joking
YOU1000000120_S0000012	this is just something i've come up with something simple straightforward and we're going to progress as the weeks go on so before you pick up your play station or xbox controller
YOU1000000120_S0000013	before you pick up your phone and go on social media let's get to work before we start i just wanna say you can do this body weight if you want but someone like me
YOU1000000120_S0000015	i prefer to use some equipment around the house so what i have here
YOU1000000120_S0000017	it's actually a kings langley school bag
YOU1000000120_S0000019	pride and honor so i'm gonna take this i'm gonna open it up
YOU1000000120_S0000020	and i'm gonna fill it up with some stuff that i've got around the house so for me
YOU1000000120_S0000022	as i love boxing i've got my boxing gloves here so i'm gonna shove them in the bag i've got some towels don't tell mum or dad but we're gonna go to the cupboard and get some
YOU1000000120_S0000023	coconut milk some peeled tomatoes i wanna zip this up now
YOU1000000120_S0000024	as heavy as you want you dictate and we're gonna use this as equipment that we can use to add weight to our workout we're gonna aim to do as many rounds as you can
YOU1000000120_S0000025	within ten minutes but it's important to remember your scores so you can come back to it day in and day out and try and improve so get ready to screenshot the workout
YOU1000000120_S0000026	so you can try this at home
YOU1000000120_S0000028	this exercise is what we call a front squat i want you to keep your back straight your shoulders engaged and i want you to do the movement nice and controlled
YOU1000000120_S0000029	and go down as far as you possibly can
YOU1000000120_S0000031	that exercise is engaging your legs your quads your hamstrings your glutes your calves and also it's engaging your shoulders so it is a good full body workout
YOU1000000120_S0000032	so in this exercise i want you to put the backpack on your back as if you're going to school and we're going to do a press up backpack on my back glutes are engaged core engaged
YOU1000000120_S0000033	shoulders tight and push
YOU1000000120_S0000035	so just like the squat it engages the full body it's gonna engage your triceps it's gonna engage your shoulders your chest it's a pusher movement
YOU1000000120_S0000036	also while you're pushing it's important to keep your core engaged as well so you've got a strong base and also activate your glutes as well if you can
YOU1000000120_S0000038	so this exercise is called a reverse lunge with an overhead press so here we have my equipment here so i've taken a bag in my left hand you can use your right hand
YOU1000000120_S0000039	it's up to you what you wanna do but also make sure you use the same side leg to reverse lunge so this is an example here so we stand straight good posture
YOU1000000120_S0000040	and i lunge back here but as you can see my knees not touching the ground i want to try and create stability so i'm engaging my core my glutes my quads
YOU1000000120_S0000041	and i'm gonna press up this is causing great instability i'm still engaged as i come down i stand up and that's one
YOU1000000120_S0000043	make sure you do both sides
YOU1000000120_S0000045	so in this exercise this is what we call a rowboat into a twist so a rowboat is something like this it's like you're rowing a boat so you're down you're up you're down you're up
YOU1000000120_S0000046	you're down you're up but we're adding a twist into this so i want you to act as if you're doing a reverse plank
YOU1000000120_S0000048	make sure your lower back's engaged it's stuck to the floor
YOU1000000120_S0000050	you're engaging your glutes your core and you row the boat and use your piece of equipment your bag with everything in it and you bring over the other side then you go down
YOU1000000120_S0000051	hold back up grab your piece of equipment and bring it to the other side not an easy exercise
YOU1000000120_S0000053	so you do have the opportunity if you would like to
YOU1000000120_S0000055	take out some of these tomatoes
YOU1000000120_S0000057	take our pair of boxing gloves make it easy for you you can adjust the weight the choice is yours
YOU1000000120_S0000062	and i'm going to use my left hand to drag this bag from my right side oh over to my left
YOU1000000120_S0000063	once i've got it over i'm going to put this hand back down i'm going to use my right hand to drag the bag from my left side over
YOU1000000120_S0000065	so it's kind of like i'm using my hand to draw an x so from one corner to another over from one corner to another and back over
YOU1000000120_S0000067	it's great for engagement in the core it's great to bring your weight down your heart rate up good for lower back pains as well all these exercises can really help
YOU1000000120_S0000068	stimulate muscles that you're not using but are really important for stability in your life in your body whether you do this in the morning whether you do in the afternoon or evening try and fit this workout somewhere within the day
YOU1000000120_S0000069	i had fun doing that i hope you guys have as well i hope you're feeling rewarded i hope you can track your progression as well so you can note your achievements down i can't wait to catch up with mister fisher
YOU1000000120_S0000070	and get to know who's been achieving and how you guys have been getting on and let us know your feedback as well so we can always make room for improvements
YOU1000000120_S0000071	so it's time to empty your school bags take your gym equipment out put your school books back in say hello to all the teachers as well make sure you focus on your math and english even if you're a little bit tired the day's nearly done keep up the good work guys and i'll see you soon
YOU1000000121_S0000001	from the sign i'm stepping back on my right leg for a double bounce one two and then left
YOU1000000121_S0000002	one two one two one two
YOU1000000121_S0000003	so essentially what i'm doing here is just switching the feets and from the back starting on the right leg for double bounce
YOU1000000121_S0000005	one two transfer one two one two
YOU1000000121_S0000006	one two from this side back on the right
YOU1000000121_S0000008	one two one two one two one two
YOU1000000121_S0000009	so just be careful when you're in this position here that you don't have your weight on that front foot because what ends up happening is the step looks like salsa
YOU1000000121_S0000010	so we wanna bring the weight back sink down in to the that back leg
YOU1000000121_S0000011	so when i take my right leg back my weight comes into my right hip i should be able to lift up that front foot
YOU1000000121_S0000012	because all of my weight is in the back leg so with samba you always want to imagine like you doing a squat or you're sitting down on a chair
YOU1000000121_S0000013	shoulders are back and weight is always backwards so if we start with our right leg that for a double bounce
YOU1000000121_S0000014	we don't want to bring the weight forward so back
YOU1000000121_S0000016	and back
YOU1000000121_S0000018	back
YOU1000000121_S0000020	and back
YOU1000000121_S0000022	so from the front lets pickup the pace a little more and one two one two one two
YOU1000000121_S0000023	see how i am switching the feet weight's always back switch
YOU1000000121_S0000025	switch switch switch let's try from the side so you can see my face
YOU1000000121_S0000027	and switch switch double bounce
YOU1000000121_S0000029	one two one two from the back right leg back
YOU1000000121_S0000031	one two one two one two one two
YOU1000000121_S0000032	and to this side right leg back one two one two one two one two one two
YOU1000000121_S0000033	one two one two one two okay so that's our basic step
YOU1000000121_S0000034	now we are gonna add arms to this step so when i step back on the right leg i'm going to bend my right arm
YOU1000000121_S0000035	so from the back stepping back on the right leg bending the right arm
YOU1000000121_S0000036	when i step back on the left leg i bend my left arm
YOU1000000121_S0000037	right leg right arm left leg left arm
YOU1000000121_S0000038	so let's try this from the front back on the right leg bending the right arm back on the left leg bending the left arm
YOU1000000121_S0000039	right leg right arm left leg left arm
YOU1000000121_S0000040	okay so remember that little tip step back on the right leg with bending the right arm back on the left leg bending the left arm
YOU1000000121_S0000041	so now we are gonna add a double bounce to that
YOU1000000121_S0000043	so let's start just with four double bounces to get into the rhythm one
YOU1000000121_S0000045	and two
YOU1000000121_S0000047	and three
YOU1000000121_S0000049	and four adding arms
YOU1000000121_S0000051	right arm
YOU1000000121_S0000053	left arm
YOU1000000121_S0000055	right arm
YOU1000000121_S0000057	left arm
YOU1000000121_S0000059	from the front back on the right so four basic double bounces
YOU1000000121_S0000060	think about your posture here shoulder is back tummy in keep bending the knees
YOU1000000121_S0000061	let's add arms right leg right arm left leg left arm
YOU1000000121_S0000063	good four
YOU1000000121_S0000065	three
YOU1000000121_S0000067	two
YOU1000000121_S0000069	and one
YOU1000000121_S0000071	double bounce a little faster let's go and one two one two one two
YOU1000000121_S0000072	another four and then we'll add arms three two relax the arms and right arm left arm
YOU1000000121_S0000073	right and left right left right and left
YOU1000000121_S0000074	so from the front eight double bounces starting back from the right left
YOU1000000121_S0000076	start and one two
YOU1000000121_S0000078	three four
YOU1000000121_S0000080	five six seven get ready for arms right leg right arm right arm left arm
YOU1000000121_S0000081	right arm left right left right and left
YOU1000000122_S0000001	take a look of theses two photos of outer space what do you see they are basically identical but not quite now look a different way in sequence
YOU1000000122_S0000002	here you see something different something moving that dot is a newly discovered world it's closer than we ever thought possible
YOU1000000122_S0000003	and the trick we used to find it could rewrite the story of our cosmic neighborhood
YOU1000000122_S0000005	today scientists have our solar system pretty well mapped out we know about the eight planets pluto moons asteroids comets
YOU1000000122_S0000006	and until recently we thought we had a handle on our solar neighborhood too
YOU1000000122_S0000008	there is the alpha centauri system about four light years away and barnard star a red dwarf a little farther out
YOU1000000122_S0000009	astronomers made these discoveries more than one hundred years ago
YOU1000000122_S0000010	but today some new work is totally up ending our view of the neighborhood it involves a space telescopes an army of volunteers and a scientist on a very specific mission
YOU1000000122_S0000011	my name is jackie faherty and i'm an astrophysicist at the american museum of natural history
YOU1000000122_S0000012	jackie has spent fifteen years searching our solar neighborhood for new neighbors
YOU1000000122_S0000013	she's focused on mysterious worlds known as brown dwarfs balls of gas that are too big to be planets but too small to be stars
YOU1000000122_S0000014	now they're they're often called failed stars but i really disliked the word failure in the title
YOU1000000122_S0000015	because i just feel like it's kind of demeaning to the brown dwarf
YOU1000000122_S0000016	it's like it needs to be a star it doesn't care and so often times i call them over excited planets
YOU1000000122_S0000017	brown dwarves would be stars if they were more massive but without enough hydrogen they don't achieve nuclear fusion
YOU1000000122_S0000018	they emit lots of infrared energy but very little visible light
YOU1000000122_S0000019	so for a long time they were hidden to astronomers but that all changed in the nineties
YOU1000000122_S0000020	infrared technology and infrared telescopes started to come online in ernest and when that happens you start to see these sky surveys
YOU1000000122_S0000021	that are able to produce the wave lengths where you can actually see the brown dwarfs
YOU1000000122_S0000022	the first brown dwarfs were i d'd around nineteen ninety-five and since then the field has exploded
YOU1000000122_S0000023	today the astronomy community is a washing imagery that could harbor nearby brown dwarfs
YOU1000000122_S0000024	actually finding them is another story but there is an old technique called the blink method that works wonders
YOU1000000122_S0000025	the basic idea is that all stars are in motion relative to us most are so far away that they move imperceptibly
YOU1000000122_S0000026	but objects in our solar neighborhood those are close enough that we can actually catch their movement if we're patient enough
YOU1000000122_S0000027	here are four images taken with various telescopes over a span of thirty-two years
YOU1000000122_S0000028	if you flip or blink through them you'll see that not everything is staying put
YOU1000000122_S0000029	objects of interest that are in the nearby vicinity they will move they will jump against the background of stars
YOU1000000122_S0000030	that is luhman sixteen a pair of brown dwarfs that's only six and a half light years from earth it was discovered using the blink method in twenty-thirteen
YOU1000000122_S0000031	and it's now the third closest known system to ours
YOU1000000122_S0000032	we had not changed that list of objects in the top five in a century it shouldn't happen
YOU1000000122_S0000033	we should not be finding objects all of a sudden that are spitting distance away from us that we've been missing all this time
YOU1000000122_S0000034	the blink method isn't new clyde tombaugh used it to discover pluto back in nineteen-thirty and it's been used to discover moons asteroids and dwarf planets
YOU1000000122_S0000035	but paired with new infrared imagery it's slowly bringing our neighborhood into focus a little too slowly really
YOU1000000122_S0000036	a few years back jackie found herself staring down millions of images that could contain new discoveries it was daunting
YOU1000000122_S0000037	i am spending hours of my time every week blinking images in like my spare time
YOU1000000122_S0000038	and i can't ah it's just as frustrating it's taking too much time and i'll never get through all of it
YOU1000000122_S0000039	the images are noisy and blurry and each one needed real attention it was far too much for any team to handle
YOU1000000122_S0000041	unless that team were hundreds of thousands of people
YOU1000000122_S0000042	and so thus sprung our citizen science project
YOU1000000122_S0000043	at the beginning my girlfriends ah they didn't understand why i was looking for ah just bunch of moving pixels ah you know for hours
YOU1000000122_S0000044	starting in twenty-seventeen jackie and her team invited the entire internet to go hunting for brown dwarfs
YOU1000000122_S0000045	their system is dead simple users login to a website and meet their first astronomy flipbook
YOU1000000122_S0000046	the images come in a sequence of four and will flip and those images flip through time so it shows you what this point in space looked like
YOU1000000122_S0000047	ah in this year and then a little bit after then a little bit after then a little bit after
YOU1000000122_S0000048	you kind of see blue and orange dots typically that are everywhere
YOU1000000122_S0000049	it looks like you are staring at colorful television static
YOU1000000122_S0000050	it can be kind of annoying at first if you don't quite know what you are looking for
YOU1000000122_S0000051	but if you are lucky you'll catch a mover
YOU1000000122_S0000052	when you finally find something moving it's a bit of a ah adrenaline rush
YOU1000000122_S0000053	faster moving objects actually do blink across the screen slower ones might just twinkle
YOU1000000122_S0000054	they are basically these little tiny like white dots um that will flash when you play our flipbooks
YOU1000000122_S0000055	either way you can mark your anomaly and alert the community
YOU1000000122_S0000057	i think i found something and everyone else kind of is like yeah yeah that's ones like oh yes i'm good i found something
YOU1000000122_S0000058	the most promising leads end up on jackie's radar her team can then book telescope time to look more closely for you citizen scientists it's back to blinking
YOU1000000122_S0000059	it like ah in a word it's like a treasure hunt ah in your couch it's it's really something that keeps you ah hooked
YOU1000000122_S0000060	since backyard worlds launched volunteers have been on a tear
YOU1000000122_S0000061	they've discovered hundreds hundreds of nearby objects
YOU1000000122_S0000062	somewhere a novel kind of compact frozen world
YOU1000000122_S0000063	prior to backyard worlds ah there was only twenty-four of them known they added five new ones
YOU1000000122_S0000064	others had surprising new atmospheres
YOU1000000122_S0000065	really strange looking objects
YOU1000000122_S0000066	and still others were hidden siblings of known objects
YOU1000000122_S0000067	i had certainly studied the brown dwarf in the system a lot in previous work and never did i guess that it had a little cold companion with it
YOU1000000122_S0000068	all in hundreds of thousands of users have found more than fifteen hundred new objects
YOU1000000122_S0000069	volunteers like dan and giam have gotten credits in academic papers for their discoveries
YOU1000000122_S0000070	there's still more to find jackie thinks the efforts could reveal a brown dwarf even closer than alpha centauri
YOU1000000122_S0000071	a new next door neighbor there's even a chance we could find the bigfoot of our solar system planet nine
YOU1000000122_S0000072	there is an object that's theorized to exist beyond pluto that is massive that it could be causing some objects in the outer solar system to be bumped around a bit
YOU1000000122_S0000073	ah and it's it's an exciting prospect now does it exist i don't know i am happy that we have citizens that are very interested in are trying to find it
YOU1000000122_S0000074	if it's real if it's there and maybe it is
YOU1000000122_S0000076	as successful as the blink method is it has competition artificial intelligence has been huge for astronomers who need to sift through tons of imagery including jackie
YOU1000000122_S0000077	the human eye is beautiful at picking out things
YOU1000000122_S0000078	it's just slow because we have to go image by image and so the human eye wins and in some ways but a i wins in speed so i use both
YOU1000000122_S0000079	one limitation of a i is that it needs to train using examples of things that it's looking for so if that thing is brand new human brains have the edge
YOU1000000122_S0000080	you are the trained algorithm at that point
YOU1000000122_S0000081	that said astronomy is facing a tidal wave of data
YOU1000000122_S0000082	in a couple of years astronomers will began imaging the entire night sky of the southern hemisphere twice a week
YOU1000000122_S0000083	there is no way we are looking through all of the data in the classic ways in the coming future it like it's over
YOU1000000122_S0000084	for now jackie will take all the help she can get from human volunteers to algorithms the humans are more enthusiastic about it
YOU1000000122_S0000085	yeah you spend countless hours pouring through images and designing custom algorithms and services and you get something great
YOU1000000122_S0000086	it's super exciting to see that all the of this work that we put in are has an impact
YOU1000000122_S0000087	you can say to yourself yeah it's a it's something i i saw
YOU1000000122_S0000088	and i'm the first human being to in the all history of mankind to to see it it's a it's a great feeling
YOU1000000122_S0000090	thank you to lexus for their support be sure to check out the new lexus i s by going to lexus dot com slash i s
YOU1000000122_S0000091	their campaign is about going all in on your passion and getting a greater reward which is why they sponsor this series on researchers and innovators
YOU1000000122_S0000092	they don't influence our editorial but they do helped make videos like this viable so thanks again to them and thank you for watching
YOU1000000123_S0000000	so ah what should and how shall i begin this is the blurb for the course
YOU1000000123_S0000001	the of that's been in there yo catalogue for a long time this is the course and ah finance
YOU1000000123_S0000002	it has the world markets in the name ah which suggests that's it's about trading
YOU1000000123_S0000004	ah
YOU1000000123_S0000006	but i think it's a broad course in fine finance
YOU1000000123_S0000007	ah so the the blurb says financial institutions are a pillar of civilized society
YOU1000000123_S0000008	directing resources across space and time to their best uses so this sounds broader i guess the course is broader
YOU1000000123_S0000009	i wrote the title of the course many years ago ah when i created this course
YOU1000000123_S0000010	and it's been a title for ah but
YOU1000000123_S0000012	ah see what really it is to me this course is about is how we get things done in our society
YOU1000000123_S0000013	that's how we incentivize people ah to do things now most of us are in our lives thinking about ourselves
YOU1000000123_S0000014	that's human nature and about our particular
YOU1000000123_S0000016	place in life cycles so ah you may be a young person who's thinking about getting started in life
YOU1000000123_S0000017	ah so when you join a enterprise or an organization ah you have to do things for the organization
YOU1000000123_S0000018	and you have to take a different perspective
YOU1000000123_S0000020	ah you have to help manage a productive venture that involves many people so there aren't that many things that you can do as an individual
YOU1000000123_S0000021	that are useful you have to join an organization this is a fundamental principle of human life
YOU1000000123_S0000023	ah so this is a course about understanding how how the institutions work ah and how ah we can predict what will happen
YOU1000000123_S0000025	and ah things are rapidly changing in the information age that we live in now
YOU1000000123_S0000027	that's what this course is about ah i don't consider well i don't consider this a vocational course
YOU1000000123_S0000028	ah because i think it's should be of interest to anybody ah who in who is interested in how things work
YOU1000000123_S0000030	on the other hand this course
YOU1000000123_S0000032	comes across as more of vocational than most yale courses and it sometimes i pride myself on that
YOU1000000123_S0000033	although i consider myself an intellectual but ah this is a relevant course alright it's not about how to make money
YOU1000000123_S0000034	ah or would you might say it is i suppose but ah it's about making things work
YOU1000000123_S0000036	these are the topics ah in this course ah so ah risk insurance diversification history of finance innovation efficient market behaviour of finance
YOU1000000123_S0000037	actually behavior of finance is a little bit more prominent than you might think from its appearance as number seven on this list
YOU1000000123_S0000038	ah behavior of finance is the application of psychology sociology other social sciences to understanding financial events
YOU1000000123_S0000040	it's a revolution in finance that i have watched over the whole course of it because i have ah organize conferences on behavior of finance
YOU1000000123_S0000041	starting in nineteen ninety-one working with ah richard taylor at university of chicago and ah
YOU1000000123_S0000042	we just ah we've been doing that for twenty-five years but we just ah decreased that there are regular seminars of professors
YOU1000000123_S0000043	ah to ah nick barbarus here at the yale school of management
YOU1000000123_S0000045	ah but we'll talk about it because i kind of believe in a unity of knowledge
YOU1000000123_S0000046	and i ah so this course will differ from many other finance courses and i i wanna talk about real people and how things really work
YOU1000000123_S0000048	ah
YOU1000000123_S0000050	then we're talking about debt the stock market the real estate market regulation oh by the way regulation is an interest of mine too
YOU1000000123_S0000051	ah more so than most people who teach finance because i think that the markets need to be regulated
YOU1000000123_S0000052	human beings have a tendency to be manipulative and tricky and finance is used to trick people
YOU1000000123_S0000053	ah that's why we need regulators so you shouldn't assume that i want to send you off to wall street
YOU1000000123_S0000054	ah i think that you might go to be a member of the great like the securities and exchange commission or something else as a job
YOU1000000123_S0000055	and be proud of it okay it's important um
YOU1000000123_S0000057	then banking future's future's market has a special meaning in finance
YOU1000000123_S0000058	ah monetary policy endowment management investment banking option money managers exchanges public finance
YOU1000000123_S0000059	non profits and finally the that last lecture will be on purpose of all this
YOU1000000123_S0000060	ah so that's this course
YOU1000000123_S0000062	so ah i wanted also to ah just reflect and the relative i said this course looks more vocational
YOU1000000123_S0000063	in a way but i don't consider this vocational school this is
YOU1000000123_S0000065	i like to say useful ah
YOU1000000123_S0000067	of one one thought i perspective i wanted to give you was how important is finance anyway now you you unless you go into academia
YOU1000000123_S0000068	you'll get a job somewhere in the real world ah so where are the jobs
YOU1000000123_S0000069	well i i looked up on the ah bureau of labour statistics who is a publication of the in u s government on their website
YOU1000000123_S0000070	they have data on just how many people are in different professions in the united states
YOU1000000123_S0000071	and they also have a forecast so what i'm showing the latest data is for the year twenty fourteen
YOU1000000123_S0000072	ah and it has the number of people in thousands ah and then also on there we have the ah projection for twenty twenty-four
YOU1000000123_S0000073	so ah you know there at the top i've got finance professions this is specific finance profession not all finance professions
YOU1000000123_S0000074	final financial analysts a financial managers personal financial advisors
YOU1000000123_S0000075	they all have hundreds of thousands of people but i wanted you to know what about the other majors that you have here at yale i'm not diminishing them
YOU1000000123_S0000076	but ah economics ah economists ah not so many
YOU1000000123_S0000078	but you might also be interested in astronomy i actually love astronomy ah ah when i was a kid i thought i'd be an astronomer
YOU1000000123_S0000079	but i i had to read reach reality there's lots of exciting fields
YOU1000000123_S0000080	where there are almost no jobs so there is how many astronomers are there
YOU1000000123_S0000082	ah sociologists political scientists or mathematicians this is not to diminish your majoring in those fields
YOU1000000123_S0000083	for you just don't expect to get a job in those fields
YOU1000000123_S0000084	ah i also put down at about massage therapist okay i didn't know that was a profession
YOU1000000123_S0000085	but there is ah projected to be about two hundred thousand massage therapists in the united states ah in twenty twenty-four
YOU1000000123_S0000086	so we don't have a massage therapy ah ah major here
YOU1000000123_S0000087	but ah that's a sign of a of ah
YOU1000000123_S0000089	how the market makes things important
YOU1000000123_S0000090	now ranaugh ferrera might be right about this there's something wrong with having so many finance people maybe we need more massage therapists
YOU1000000123_S0000091	and not finance people ah
YOU1000000123_S0000092	but there's a sense of reality that i i think that
YOU1000000123_S0000093	part of the reason that there's so many of them is that they deal with important issues that can't be quickly um
YOU1000000123_S0000094	it can't be more easily solve we need we need all these people that's why i take some pride in this course in being connected to the real world
YOU1000000123_S0000095	there are real job opportunities in finance and there are also i think in the new industrial revolution period
YOU1000000123_S0000096	they will still be i think this is one of the fields that ah is not going to be
YOU1000000123_S0000098	totally replace by computer the problem with finance is the is the is a high inequality in these in these ah ah in this field
YOU1000000123_S0000099	some people ah make a lot of money but on the other hand you have to give it away this is another thing about this course
YOU1000000123_S0000100	if you make a lot of money in finance it's a game you enjoyed it now give most of it away that's that's going to be a theme
YOU1000000124_S0000000	there're long insecurities route ah only arrive but again of the end
YOU1000000124_S0000002	so it's been a battle going on for a long time about the nature of artificial intelligence and what is nature should be
YOU1000000124_S0000003	there's two very different approaches they are very different ideologies um one is inspired by logic
YOU1000000124_S0000004	and so the other day is in the essence of intelligence is using symbolic rules to manipulate symbolic expressions
YOU1000000124_S0000005	and the people who believed this or people who believed it um didn't think this was empirical they thought that's the only way you have intelligence and sort of sort of necessary truth the possible intelligence it gonna be
YOU1000000124_S0000007	there's a different set of people um who were equally ideological who believed that if you want to make an intelligence system you should look to biology
YOU1000000124_S0000008	and in particularly huge trying understand how to brain with two yet
YOU1000000124_S0000010	and it doesn't look as if the brains of animals but doing it by logic of course it's also it's a debate about whether animals are intelligent but um
YOU1000000124_S0000012	the biological inspire people followed the essence of intelligence who was learning the connections strengths in the neural network
YOU1000000124_S0000013	and you can see these two two completely different world views they they cannot miss each other um
YOU1000000124_S0000015	so there's a battle went on for all time in the nineteen sixties we we had very simple neural nets and we had a simple learning output interval
YOU1000000124_S0000017	they only had one node features and they were completely wiped out by symbolic element
YOU1000000124_S0000019	so when i started in graduate schools in ninety-seventies it was one of my neural network in nonsense they were the past they were never do anything and to be improved they were useless
YOU1000000124_S0000021	that's why we start and that's what almost everybody know happening
YOU1000000124_S0000023	then in the ninety eighties
YOU1000000124_S0000025	um various groups came up with the back propagation feature and none void neural networks to learn multiplier features
YOU1000000124_S0000027	so we got over this problem but until then neural networks just had hand design features they waited those features to make a decision and then they made a decision
YOU1000000124_S0000028	they didn't learn their own features with back propagation we could learn there's features and there's a lot hype that propagation could solve everything um that's why i believed
YOU1000000124_S0000029	that is i believed in the eighties that what's happening a day is gonna happen then and it didn't
YOU1000000124_S0000031	in the nineteen nineties
YOU1000000124_S0000033	um people shared through other machine learning algorithms so we were better than back propagation on multi-size problems things for support activations
YOU1000000124_S0000034	they have fancier map and they worked a little bit better well what we now think of is very small problems things with a few thousands training examples
YOU1000000124_S0000036	so neural networks wipe that again
YOU1000000124_S0000038	then in about two thousand and six we came up with some technical improvements to neural networks that made them a bit easier to learn
YOU1000000124_S0000039	and that was the main point at that time you got more competition and more data and suddenly neural networks with lot's of laser features work amazingly work
YOU1000000124_S0000040	and now google and facebook and microsoft and apple and amazon and all the other high tech companies you can think of individual one ah all betting the pharma neural networks
YOU1000000124_S0000041	they believe that's certainly to be the future and the huge demand for students who know anything about neural networks
YOU1000000124_S0000043	so the old way to make a computer to do what you wanted which write a program
YOU1000000124_S0000044	where you figure it out how you doing yourself and then you explain to the computing exquisite detail how to do what you would have done yourself with a whole lot process
YOU1000000124_S0000046	so if i want to consult this representative i would trigger out well i'm not a computer scientist you'll quickly realize
YOU1000000124_S0000047	i would figure out well i could go down the list and find the biggest thing and then put that up to top and then i could go down the list again and find the next biggest thing and put that underneath those thing
YOU1000000124_S0000048	it's not a good algorithm but i might decide to do it like that and then i could tell the computer to that and then the computer will sort list faster than i could
YOU1000000124_S0000050	the new edge to do it is to you first tell the computer to pretend to be a neural network
YOU1000000124_S0000052	and then you just show it examples so you showed an example of unsorted list in a sorted list and show lots of example and so you take these things and produce those things
YOU1000000124_S0000053	and after while you gets the idea as it you don't have to write a program
YOU1000000124_S0000055	sorting list is something this difficult to do this way recognizing objects images is something is much easier to do this way
YOU1000000124_S0000057	so here's an example with something we like computers to do and people in classical era tried to this for fifty years and they didn't make much progress
YOU1000000124_S0000058	so the idea is to give them the r g b values of hole bunch pixels and you have to convert those to a caption which describes percentage
YOU1000000124_S0000059	so you'll need numbers coming in and you have a string of words coming out
YOU1000000124_S0000061	and you cannot imagine how you might go about writing a program to that but you can imagine it's gonna be difficult
YOU1000000124_S0000062	you first of all would maybe is write a program to find the little pieces of edge in the image or maybe color contrasts
YOU1000000124_S0000063	and just do in the vision would be more than you can do it
YOU1000000124_S0000065	and then relating through vision to the language will become ranges now what we can do is we can solve that problem just by using machine learning
YOU1000000124_S0000067	um with hardly any hand program
YOU1000000124_S0000069	and by the end of the lecture you'll understand how could you do that
YOU1000000124_S0000071	okay is that louder good okay i think the mic is turned on and
YOU1000000124_S0000073	so i'm to going explain many of you have this already but i'm explaining more hard before you all miss it's a little computational advice
YOU1000000124_S0000074	that's a little bit like windrow but not very it takes some inputs coming typically from other neurons has weights on the connections
YOU1000000124_S0000075	it takes the inputs times the weight has it up by statistical input and then it puts it through a non area function
YOU1000000124_S0000076	but non functional will work there is when we list to use that and that's exactly
YOU1000000124_S0000077	so basically that non linear function simply says if you've got a lot of input and give a lot of output and if your inputs below a threshold don't give any output
YOU1000000124_S0000078	so it's called a rectified linear
YOU1000000124_S0000080	and the question is if you look together about to those guys then you figure out a way to make those weights on the connection at the time what can you do with it
YOU1000000124_S0000082	so we took the helping together by making multiple layers this again is sort of neural inspired and if you look at about to line up neural network like that
YOU1000000124_S0000084	the layers in the middle it's hard to figure out what the way it should be when you'll adapt those ways in effect you decide more features
YOU1000000124_S0000085	they know is in the middle layer you should detect so the problem detecting is basically a problem deciding what individual features do you want in the same problem
YOU1000000124_S0000087	now i'm show you a way of learning those features um but ah really stupid
YOU1000000124_S0000088	of the devil of you work um we're going to give it inputs and we're going to tell it what the right answer is
YOU1000000124_S0000089	and then we gonna adapt away it's one ratio time
YOU1000000124_S0000091	so the suppose you want someone you can tell the difference in pictures of cats and pictures of dogs we give it two out that's one of the cat one of the dog
YOU1000000124_S0000092	and if you show it a cat on the output for dogie side in the output for cat that's bad um so we can share a bunch of pictures and measure how what it's doing
YOU1000000124_S0000094	and then we can pick one of the ways in the network and we can change the value of that weight
YOU1000000124_S0000096	and we can see if the network is doing better or worse than it was before to see that you need to show a bunch of examples
YOU1000000124_S0000097	um if the change worked we keep it then we look again another way
YOU1000000124_S0000099	now i think you can see that that algorithm is gonna have to show a bunch of examples for each weight and if you got a billion weights it's gonna be extremely slow
YOU1000000124_S0000101	but that's what we want to do we only change weights in the direction that makes him help that's all we're trying to do we are just trying to do that efficiently
YOU1000000124_S0000102	and back propagation which many of you know but i'm not gonna explain that
YOU1000000124_S0000103	it's just the efficient way of computing how to change the weights in the direction that will help reduce the discrepancy between what the network and what you'd like to write
YOU1000000124_S0000105	and the big difference is that if you perturb the weights you measures the effects of a change plays on the network
YOU1000000124_S0000106	well in back propagation you compute the effects so if you know always in the network you don't have to measure you can compute
YOU1000000124_S0000107	when you compute you can compute for always at the same time what direction we should change them to help
YOU1000000124_S0000108	you can't do that when you're measuring you have to change the one for time um
YOU1000000124_S0000110	so measure so computing is not for artificial measuring evolution can't do the same measuring and can't do the same computing algorithm cause evolution will change a gene
YOU1000000124_S0000111	and then there's a whole developmental process in the environment and you don't know unless you can back propagate through
YOU1000000124_S0000113	so what evolution did was it came up with the brains so that it could be back propagation as much they
YOU1000000124_S0000114	so back propagation you go forced through these layers you compare with back propagation you back probably at signals that realize you to compute each way what direction change it in to make it work better
YOU1000000124_S0000116	and we thought in the eighties that was problem solving we command on lots of those but it didn't work very well
YOU1000000124_S0000118	and we didn't know why it didn't work most people thought it didn't work because this is a stupid idea that is the idea that you would take a network with random ways
YOU1000000124_S0000119	and you just showed a work data and there's a lot of thing this data be able to design on its own feature detectors
YOU1000000124_S0000120	and do very good performance of things like machine translation or recognizing objects and images or recognizing speech
YOU1000000124_S0000122	almost everybody know hang on so far idea was completely crazy um a few of us didn't a few of us just thought we didn't know why it's not working
YOU1000000124_S0000123	it's obviously the right thing to do and we discovered later the reason wasn't working was was computers which is learn data in not minimum
YOU1000000124_S0000124	um if you take that in the eighties people would said oh yeah sure if you have bigger computer and more data it will work but look it doesn't work um it turned out that is right
YOU1000000124_S0000125	among we got a bigger computer and more data it worked now there is in technical things too but it was mainly the increasing computer speed and data size that matter
YOU1000000124_S0000128	so i'm gonna show you a couple of examples before i get back to you show what function is um
YOU1000000124_S0000130	the example that premier the most impact is in two thousand and twelve there was a big public competition where you have a thousand different types of object and a million training images
YOU1000000124_S0000131	and you have to learn to recognize the different types of object and there's a a secret test set um so you can't you know test that
YOU1000000124_S0000132	and it's can't do this right if you get the correct pause in your top five bets because it's not play what the right bet is for someone
YOU1000000124_S0000133	for example you have a image which has a dalmatian in the board of chairs and same dalmatian the same chair is one of those is right and if you say both you can't get it right
YOU1000000124_S0000136	so we look the best existing computer vision methods we used and the results look like this
YOU1000000124_S0000138	um results of the top where we are now um results below
YOU1000000124_S0000140	two of my graduate students in university of toronto ah managed to get sixteen percent
YOU1000000124_S0000141	and then the best computer vision groups um were getting more than twenty-five percent work
YOU1000000124_S0000142	so we almost have the average and that kind of huge impact on computer vision almost overnight that is within the year
YOU1000000124_S0000143	um all living people change from um doing handles chew things doing what they were doing before to do in your own nets
YOU1000000124_S0000144	and so in two thousand and eleven if you send a paper using your instant computer vision conference it would be rejected because it was using neural nets
YOU1000000124_S0000145	and by two thousand and fifteen if you send a paper to computer vision conference it will be rejected if it wasn't using neural nets it is a little bit of change
YOU1000000124_S0000147	okay it was obvious if two grad students can beat the best computer vision research as if you're doing this stuff for thousand years then you're gonna develop more further
YOU1000000124_S0000148	and the thing is did by two thousand and fifteen the error rate on engineering was seventy-five percent which is about the human error right and now it's down to three percent you can see the credibility there
YOU1000000124_S0000150	so i'll just use show you some examples that kind of work in computer vision
YOU1000000124_S0000152	so there's an image and the right answer is cheater and if you look at the what the neuron x says it's very confident the cheater is the right answer
YOU1000000124_S0000153	and it has a few of other things the things are totally out of the question like leopard and snow leopard and egyptian cat so put it all its back up on this is a very sensible answers
YOU1000000124_S0000154	and if is that's not a sort of typically legitimate cheater half the heads missing and it's a cheater pose up right
YOU1000000124_S0000155	it's not a sort of classic it's not the diagram we make of a cheater to say shows on me what a cheater is
YOU1000000124_S0000157	here's a bullet train and your lashes the bullet train probably occupies less than ten percent of the pixels the building in the background is much bigger
YOU1000000124_S0000158	there's a platform there's a person on the platform pretty sort of knows what the right hands is likely to be cause i'm just talk about the focus of images
YOU1000000124_S0000159	and you put the thing you want to attend to in the middle and all this in terms of answers is practice useable
YOU1000000124_S0000161	he's got might a guess as well
YOU1000000124_S0000163	so the correct answer is hand glass
YOU1000000124_S0000165	he thinks the best answer is scissors and you can sort of seem like using scissors um you can see better why i might think try with that
YOU1000000124_S0000166	it it doesn't understand that that thing that i think must be in chain is in the handle of a frame pack basically it needs glasses and um
YOU1000000124_S0000167	you'll see what i say step this code and the important thing here is that all the wrong answers are visually plausible wrong answers
YOU1000000124_S0000168	to give you an idea of the understands of lot about what things look like
YOU1000000124_S0000170	okay so that i huge spectral computer vision and then a few years later
YOU1000000124_S0000171	um some very great people including elias eskaban who is one of the people with the um in two thousand and twelve image that system um
YOU1000000124_S0000173	decided that try neural nets on machine translation a machine translation attribute the perfect problem for symbolic era
YOU1000000124_S0000174	so people in symbolic era i mean we all agree that symbols come in and symbols come out okay
YOU1000000124_S0000175	the question is what's in between is it just more symbols
YOU1000000124_S0000176	so the classic a i view is symbols come in what's inside is sort of like symbols it's sort of cleaned up symbols
YOU1000000124_S0000177	i mean symbolic expressions and you do manipulations on symbolic expressions and then another symbol string comes out so it's from of symbols
YOU1000000124_S0000179	the biological view would be symbols come in there the way we code things to go over communication channel
YOU1000000124_S0000180	and resist noise nicely once the symbols are come in they get converted to things that are nothing like those symbols
YOU1000000124_S0000182	so the point about a symbol is it only has basically one property a symbol either is always not identical to another symbol
YOU1000000124_S0000184	we take two different symbols the only property that matters are they the same symbol
YOU1000000124_S0000186	okay all the other properties are just
YOU1000000124_S0000188	of too far through the symbol that are not relevant to the process
YOU1000000124_S0000190	in neural nets what happens it's a symbol comes in and it gets converted into a greatly vector that has all sorts of features
YOU1000000124_S0000191	that capture lots of knowledge about the meaning of that word
YOU1000000124_S0000193	and words that mean similar things but don't look similar like friday and wednesday
YOU1000000124_S0000195	they mean pretty similar things that distinct symbols
YOU1000000124_S0000197	there's nothing well there's that more few week structure of day so that's bad example but but basically um that
YOU1000000124_S0000199	that distinct symbols and that's all the symbol processing system knows in a neural net it learns that wednesday and friday are very very similar things we will see that later
YOU1000000124_S0000201	so the symbolic era approaching machine translation is to say okay a simple stream comes in english
YOU1000000124_S0000202	we'll do some manipulations using rules and that we're clearly gonna use rules of grammar we will also be used semantic rules that somehow do composition or semantic
YOU1000000124_S0000203	that is given what the individual pieces mean they figure out what a group of pieces must mean um and then we're going to produce symbols coming out
YOU1000000124_S0000205	and we're gonna use all the knowledge that linguist have about how language works
YOU1000000124_S0000207	the neural network approach now even i thought this was a bit crazy and bit ambitious
YOU1000000124_S0000208	um is to say let's just take a whole bunch of translations pairs of english sentences and french sentences
YOU1000000124_S0000210	and we'll stick in the english sentence one word in a time and then we're going to our our current neural network we shall explain in a minute what cycles around its inside
YOU1000000124_S0000212	and after we finish sticking the english sentence that will carry a neural network we'll have some particular state of activity and we're cool about a thought vector
YOU1000000124_S0000214	and that's what i thought is is the state about activity than the neural net after the english sentence
YOU1000000124_S0000216	and you'll notice if you think about how the word fault works in english i could say john
YOU1000000125_S0000000	well i'll tell you a couple of strange things that that the things that i don't really understand the first is when we've done the analysis of the effects of the future authoring program
YOU1000000125_S0000001	it has had a different differential impact on men
YOU1000000125_S0000002	and it's had a particularly differential impact on what i would call excluded men
YOU1000000125_S0000003	and so that would be non-western ethnic minority men or or but
YOU1000000125_S0000004	majority men who are doing very well so for example at moriah college
YOU1000000125_S0000005	the future authoring program had a particularly robust effect on moriah college students who were men who hadn't done very well in high school and who hadn't pick picked a major
YOU1000000125_S0000006	that had a destination a career destination at its end
YOU1000000125_S0000007	so you can imagine those peoples are they have ambiguous relationship with the idea of education
YOU1000000125_S0000008	and they are not oriented specifically towards a goal they're not very motivated
YOU1000000125_S0000010	now why did it have a differential effect on men that's a good question
YOU1000000125_S0000012	well first of all the women are doing well
YOU1000000125_S0000013	so it might just be a matter of the effect that it does better for people who aren't doing as well and at the moment most of them are men
YOU1000000125_S0000014	i don't believe i think that might be part of it but i don't believe that's all of it
YOU1000000125_S0000015	i think that part of the reason that women are doing better is cause they're agreeable and so if a system sets out a structure and says here's a pathway to attainment
YOU1000000125_S0000016	the women won't rebel against that they'll go along with it and that's working very well for them at the moment
YOU1000000125_S0000017	the men especially the men on the disagreeable end of the distribution and there is way more men on the distri disagreeable end of the distribution than there are women
YOU1000000125_S0000018	like that's what you get from if you look at overlapping normal distributions so there is the male distri female distribution for agreeableness
YOU1000000125_S0000019	male distribution for agreeableness tremendous overlap
YOU1000000125_S0000021	women are higher all the really agreeable people are women all the really disagreeable people are men and maybe the real differences occur at the extremes right so
YOU1000000125_S0000022	so in it's it's very interesting side effect of overlapping distributions so they people can be mostly the same but that can still produce radical differences
YOU1000000125_S0000024	disagreeable men won't do anything they don't wanna do
YOU1000000125_S0000026	they just say appears i'll go home and play video games he was in i'm not listening to your stupid classes and why should i work for you i will just go have fun
YOU1000000125_S0000027	i'll do my own thing i don't think they're motivated and so then if you take the men who are right that and you say okay what do you want
YOU1000000125_S0000029	you can have what you want but you have to figure out what it is so then they write down what they want if they go oh hey well that might be worth having so maybe i'll put some effort into it
YOU1000000125_S0000030	that's what it looks like to me now you know that's weak evidence and this is a weak argument but i'm trying to stretch out my understanding to account for this but i tell you something else that's really weird
YOU1000000125_S0000031	i don't understand this either so
YOU1000000125_S0000033	more than ninety percent of the people who watch my videos on youtube are men now that's weird because not above eighty percent of psychology students are women
YOU1000000125_S0000034	so that is not what you would expect right you would expect that the ma ma majority of them would be women and you might say well it's because of the political stance i've taken
YOU1000000125_S0000035	my thought well that's possible so i went and looked at the demographic data because i have that well before i did any of the political videos eighty-five percent of my viewers were men
YOU1000000125_S0000036	so it's actually increased a bit it's increased by six percent and that's not trivial but it was still overwhelmingly men
YOU1000000125_S0000037	so that was interesting i thought what the hell why is that exactly and then now i have been watching crowds when i have been talking to them and the crowds that they have come to see in person
YOU1000000125_S0000038	this happened at the university of toronto free speech debate and i actually noticed it and commented on it before the debate took place because i was talking about intrinsic differences between men and women
YOU1000000125_S0000039	and i looked around the room and i thought hm hey eighty percent of the people in this room are men so i had all the man women stand up and then all men stand up i said look like
YOU1000000125_S0000040	here is a natural experiment for some reason eighty percent of the people who showed up to this are men now everybody thought i was kinda cracked to do to do that
YOU1000000125_S0000041	and it was a risk you know what and and i but i thought no there's something going on here and then what's interesting now is that every public appearance that i've made
YOU1000000125_S0000042	that's related to the sort of topics that we're discussing is overwhelmingly men it's like it's like eight-five to ninety percent
YOU1000000125_S0000043	and so i thought wow that's weird like what they hell is going on here exactly and then the other thing i've noticed is that
YOU1000000125_S0000044	i've been talking a lot to the crowds that i've been talking to not about rights but about responsibility right
YOU1000000125_S0000045	because you can have the bloody convers what are you doing you can't have the conversation about rights without the conversation about responsibility because
YOU1000000125_S0000046	your rights are my responsibility that's what they are technically so you just can't have only half of that discussion
YOU1000000125_S0000047	and we're only having half that discussion the question is what the hell are you leaving out if you only have that half of the discussion
YOU1000000125_S0000048	and the answer is why you leaving up responsibility and then the question is for what are you leaving out if you leaving up the responsibility and the answer might be or maybe you leaving out the meaning of life
YOU1000000125_S0000050	that's what it looks like to me it's like here you are suffering away what makes it worth while rights
YOU1000000125_S0000051	you know you are completely out you are completely you have no idea what your ah you it's almost impossible to describe how bad an idea that is
YOU1000000125_S0000053	responsibility
YOU1000000125_S0000055	password gives life meaning it's like lift a load then you can tolerate yourself right cause look at you useless easily hurt
YOU1000000125_S0000056	easily killed why should you have any self respect that's the the story of the fall pick something up and carry it pick make it heavy enough so that you can think
YOU1000000125_S0000057	yeah well useless as i am at least i could move that from there to there well what's really cool about that is that when i talk to these crowds about this
YOU1000000125_S0000058	the men's eyes light up that's very like i have seen that phenomenon because i've been talking about this mythological material for a long time and i can see when i'm watching crowds people you know their eyebrows lift
YOU1000000125_S0000059	their eyes lie light up because i put something together for them that's what mythological stories do so i'm not taking responsibility for that that's what the stories do
YOU1000000125_S0000060	so i say the story and people go click click click you know and their eyes light up but this responsibility thing that's a whole new order of this is that young men are so hungry for that
YOU1000000125_S0000061	it is unbelievable and one of the things i have been talking to some of the people who'd be um running for the conservative leadership in canada and i've been talking to them about
YOU1000000125_S0000062	well the difficulties they have is communicating with young people because conservatives what what the hell are they gonna sell to young people right cause being conservative is something that happens when you're older they can sell responsibility
YOU1000000125_S0000064	no one's selling it and the thing is for men there is nothing but responsibility you know i was watching the simpsons the other day i watched the first simpsons's episode and
YOU1000000125_S0000065	and i deconstructed it
YOU1000000125_S0000067	and so it's really interesting so what happens in the first simpson's episode is that it's christmas and homer and marge are going to buy some christmas presents but homer doesn't get his christmas bonus
YOU1000000125_S0000068	and so he's absolutely crushed by that and that actually is a recurring theme in the simpson's where homer loses his job or something like that or can't like make enough money
YOU1000000125_S0000069	he's completely crushed even though he's kind of useless bumbling laughing fool of a guy you know
YOU1000000125_S0000070	the the thing that gives that show it's soul is that he is still oriented towards his family that's what makes him honorable is that foolish as he is
YOU1000000125_S0000071	he's decided to adopt responsibility for his family and to try to bear that and so he's not he's a holy fool he's not a complete fool
YOU1000000125_S0000072	and it's so interesting watching the story because he suffers dreadfully as a consequence of not being able to fulfill his responsibility well that's for men
YOU1000000125_S0000073	women have their sense of responsibilities they're not the same right because of their complicated because women of course have to take primary responsibility
YOU1000000125_S0000074	for for having infants at least but then also for caring for them they're they're structured differently then men
YOU1000000125_S0000076	pro biological necessity even if it's not a psychological issue and it's also partly a psychological issue women know what they have to do men have to figure out what they have to do
YOU1000000125_S0000077	and if they have nothing worth living for then they stay pit-a-pat
YOU1000000125_S0000079	and why the hell not
YOU1000000125_S0000081	because the alternative to valued responsibility is
YOU1000000125_S0000083	impulsive low class pleasure and you saw that in the pinocchio story right that's a pleasure island it's like well why lift a load if there's nothing in it for you
YOU1000000125_S0000085	that's another thing we're doing to men that's a very bad idea and to boys it's like
YOU1000000125_S0000087	you're pathological and oppressive it's like fine then why the hell am i gonna play if that's the if that's the situation if i get no credit for bearing responsibility
YOU1000000125_S0000088	could bloody well be sure i'm not gonna bear any but then you know your life is useless and meaningless yeah you're not you're full of self contempt and denialism and
YOU1000000125_S0000089	and that's not good and so that's why i think i that's what i think is going on at a deeper level with regards to men needing this direction
YOU1000000125_S0000090	a man has to decide that he's going to do something he has to decide that
YOU1000000125_S0000091	yeah well you know partly what you're trying to do in the future offering process is to say okay well what's your highest value right it's the star it's like okay what are you aiming for
YOU1000000125_S0000092	you can decide man but you know there's some criteria it should be good for you it should be good for you in a way that facilitates you moving forward
YOU1000000125_S0000093	maybe it should be good for you in a way that's also good for the family and the community it should cover the the domain of life
YOU1000000125_S0000094	i mean there's constraints on what you should regard as a value but you but within those constraints you have the
YOU1000000125_S0000096	choice you have choice well the thing is that is people will carry a heavy load if they get to pick the god damn load
YOU1000000125_S0000098	so and they think well i won't carry any load it's like okay fine but then you're like this sled dog that doesn't have a sled to pull you're just gonna
YOU1000000125_S0000099	you're gonna tear pieces out of your own legs because you're bored you know you need people are pack animals they need they need to pull against a weight
YOU1000000125_S0000100	and and that's not true for everyone it's not true particularly say for low consciousness people i mean maybe they're open and creative or extroverted or some other things
YOU1000000125_S0000101	but for the for the typical person
YOU1000000125_S0000103	they they they'll eat themselves they'll eat themselves up unless they have a low this is why there's such an opiate at epidemic among ah dispossessed white middle-aged guys
YOU1000000125_S0000104	who are unemployed in the u s it's like they lose their job they're done
YOU1000000125_S0000106	right they despise themselves they develop chronic pain syndromes and depression and the chronic pain is treated with opiate it's like that's what we're doing so
YOU1000000125_S0000107	yeah that's what it looks like to me is you you have to and it's so interesting to watch the young men when you talk to them about responsibility they're so god damn thrilled about it
YOU1000000125_S0000108	it just blows me away it's like really
YOU1000000125_S0000110	that's what's that's the counter culture
YOU1000000125_S0000112	grow the hell up and do something useful really i could do that oh i'm so excited by that idea no one ever mentioned that before
YOU1000000125_S0000113	it's like right right right right jesus it's it's it's a polling it's it's and and i feel that's deeply felt by the people
YOU1000000125_S0000114	who are who are coming out to to listen to these sorts of things too there they've had enough of that
YOU1000000125_S0000116	so and they better have because it's it's a non-productive motive being responsibility man that's where the meaning in life is so
YOU1000000126_S0000000	now it's my privilege to introduce andrew ng he's co-founder and chairman of the board of coursera
YOU1000000126_S0000001	he's an adjunct professor in the computer science department at stanford university
YOU1000000126_S0000002	and ah as i think everybody knows in twenty eleven he lead the development of stanford's massive open online course platform a mooc
YOU1000000126_S0000003	and taught an online machine learning class that was offered to over a hundred-thousand students that was the initiative that led to the co-founding of coursera
YOU1000000126_S0000004	he was also the founding lead of the google brain team which helped google become a leading a i company as well as the former chief scientist at baidu
YOU1000000126_S0000006	where he led the company's a i strategy and execution he's authored or co-authored two hundred research papers in machine learning robotics and related fields
YOU1000000126_S0000007	in twenty thirteen he was named in the time hundred list the most influential people he holds degrees from carnegie mellon university oops
YOU1000000126_S0000008	carnegie mellon university sorry folks m i t and the university of california berkeley
YOU1000000126_S0000009	and perhaps what's the most interesting to me personally about andrew is that he teaches eleven coursera courses
YOU1000000126_S0000010	and he has taught over three point four million learners that's a lot of people
YOU1000000126_S0000011	welcome andrew
YOU1000000126_S0000013	thanks betty um and thanks everyone for joining us but sticking with us to the end of this conference
YOU1000000126_S0000014	ah i was browsing through the attendees names and regretful that we can't be hanging out in person together
YOU1000000126_S0000015	um but all the i've attended every coursera upon these conference since the first one and this is the largest one with ever held so that that that's a that's a silver lining
YOU1000000126_S0000016	so that um let me share my slides
YOU1000000126_S0000018	so hopefully you can see this
YOU1000000126_S0000020	um
YOU1000000126_S0000022	listening to all of the presentations from earlier today i feel that
YOU1000000126_S0000024	because of the rise of covid um
YOU1000000126_S0000026	there's not full control of our higher education
YOU1000000126_S0000028	society is crying out to ask for help and we as a community have the capability to help a lot of people maybe not everyone but a lot of people
YOU1000000126_S0000030	and the choices we make in this community in higher education community the choices we make over the next era will stay with us for decades to come
YOU1000000126_S0000032	the online education movement has been devolving for a decade or maybe many decades
YOU1000000126_S0000033	ah as some you know about the starting of coursera where we had started with two courses at the stanford the machine learning class that i taught daily basis class
YOU1000000126_S0000034	taught by my friend genitel witham
YOU1000000126_S0000035	and in the not quite decade since then the number of courses has grown from two to ah over four thousand on coursera and then launch a number grow one
YOU1000000126_S0000037	so this has been growing for a long time and all of you our community has been learning to figure out how to teach online
YOU1000000126_S0000039	um
YOU1000000126_S0000041	and covid accelerating everything
YOU1000000126_S0000043	we've seen how many workers are hit by covid ah especially the ones with without the degree
YOU1000000126_S0000045	we have seen um how more people are taking online courses to help deal with self isolation also learn about public health
YOU1000000126_S0000047	covid is also treating unique challenges on institutions ah washington coast new york times reported college students rebelling against school tuition after classes move online
YOU1000000126_S0000048	and i was gratified when i heard ah mathew in the panel just now talk about lower pricing announcing lower pricing for this summer session
YOU1000000126_S0000049	so many of the trends that happen underway are accelerated by covid ah we all know that society is hurting
YOU1000000126_S0000050	the i m f estimates that the world will experience a worst recession since the great depression
YOU1000000126_S0000051	ah most of us many of us that live through the global financial crisis of two thousand nine where the global economy um shrunk by point one percent
YOU1000000126_S0000052	this time round it will shrink much more by i m f estimates and just in u s alone twenty-two million unemployed in a matter of weeks
YOU1000000126_S0000053	and people people are hurting
YOU1000000126_S0000055	we have a big role to play to help many of these people
YOU1000000126_S0000057	and
YOU1000000126_S0000059	compounding trend on trend trust in expertise and trust in institutions has also been going down not just for the past few months but but for many years now
YOU1000000126_S0000060	ah edelman carries out a ah large annual very large multi-city survey called the edelman trust barometer
YOU1000000126_S0000061	and um they wanted me to study as they plot
YOU1000000126_S0000064	different institutions according to how competent they are viewed and how ethical they are viewed
YOU1000000126_S0000065	so the horizontal axis is how competent is an institution vertical axis is how ethical is an institution
YOU1000000126_S0000066	um and businesses are viewed as quite competent but not always the most ethical on average
YOU1000000126_S0000067	um n g o's non-government organizations are viewed as relatively ethical but not as competent
YOU1000000126_S0000068	and government media are perceived by citizens all round the world as it's neither industrially competent nor ethical
YOU1000000126_S0000069	i'm not saying that any of these perceptions are fair um i think there are plenty of highly competent and highly ethical individuals in all of these institutions
YOU1000000126_S0000070	but this is a perception of large swath of society and we have a lack of institutions that broadly perceived um
YOU1000000126_S0000071	fairly or unfairly well that lack of institutions ah broadly perceive as both highly competent and highly ethical
YOU1000000126_S0000072	i would quite like for our institutions of education not institutions of higher education to be able to play that role
YOU1000000126_S0000073	ah this trust barometer did not have a note specifically on higher education but we've all seen the trends ah as as educators for for for many years now
YOU1000000126_S0000075	and so maybe there's no surprise therefore that with the rise of covid with all of these impacts um higher education is in crisis
YOU1000000126_S0000076	you've seen just in the last few recent period of the time articles with titles like crisis in higher education or in my home state at california california's higher education crisis
YOU1000000126_S0000077	or crisis of higher american higher education and so on on and on and on we've seen articles like these
YOU1000000126_S0000078	oh and did i say that this is a set created by the covid crisis actually these articles have published ah well before the covid crisis
YOU1000000126_S0000079	so it's strange and interesting that the field of higher education has been in crisis for about a decade now
YOU1000000126_S0000080	um i think covid is accelerating this crisis but if we were already in this state even before ah the recent pandemic
YOU1000000126_S0000081	i think this is even more troubling now you know there there is i i i'm proud to be an educator it's all about discipline very committed to education
YOU1000000126_S0000082	but i would quite liked do something so that maybe by the year twenty twenty-five we can all work really hard for a few years and and not be in crisis
YOU1000000126_S0000083	ah anymore a few years from now it does seem like the healthiest day for our industry to be at the happening crisis that's a long
YOU1000000126_S0000084	um but to me i think this popular reflection of of the state of crisis is is maybe a sign that
YOU1000000126_S0000085	despite all the very positive contributions that we have and we're striving to to to make that that's a potential for us to do even better
YOU1000000126_S0000087	one of the documents that moved me the most um is the ah universal declaration of human rights
YOU1000000126_S0000088	i had first read this document when i was a young assistant professors and then and it really moved me the first time i read this
YOU1000000126_S0000089	ah we closing from article twenty-six um it says we we we as a society declared in nineteen forty-eight
YOU1000000126_S0000090	ah that was the year my father was born seventy-two years ago
YOU1000000126_S0000091	we society decided that everyone has the right to education
YOU1000000126_S0000092	um education free at this elementary and fundamental stages second professional education agenda available
YOU1000000126_S0000093	and higher education shall be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit
YOU1000000126_S0000094	sadly despite this proud declaration this beautiful declaration that we made as a society seventy-two years ago
YOU1000000126_S0000095	this still isn't a reality we live in today
YOU1000000126_S0000096	and education is limited by geography um by social economical limitations by political restrictions
YOU1000000126_S0000097	these restrictions have already been making it hard for students to gain an education and has become even harder just in the past few weeks
YOU1000000126_S0000098	um just last night the united states president tweeted out about suspending immigration ah to united states
YOU1000000126_S0000099	and i i have no idea how this will affect many of our students that have been or are counting on maybe coming to the united states
YOU1000000126_S0000100	um for their for their studies
YOU1000000126_S0000101	and and even simone and outside united states ah simone from imperial on the panel mentioned just now people finding it hard to get to london
YOU1000000126_S0000102	this is true not just in united states and in u k but all around the world and covid is accelerating travel restrictions like crazy
YOU1000000126_S0000103	i think that's all of us to use additional ran to make sure that education becomes more rather than less accessible
YOU1000000126_S0000105	now in this all of this ah doom and gloom i mean is all of these challenges we faced there is a massive silver lining
YOU1000000126_S0000106	um i think silver lining is that there's great acceptance of the virtual world of online education
YOU1000000126_S0000107	and we're also really lucky that we work in an industry sector than in education a lot of our work can move online
YOU1000000126_S0000108	not all of it not easily but a lot of our work can move online
YOU1000000126_S0000109	so as an educator i feel special responsibility for us to lead this change and to play the role that all of us
YOU1000000126_S0000111	that all of you can play to help the rest of society
YOU1000000126_S0000113	and part of the silver lining is that even with everything going on around the world
YOU1000000126_S0000114	i see that people want to feel empowered um despite the unemployment despite the uncertainty around the world
YOU1000000126_S0000115	people wake up in the morning wanting to help productive quarantine mornings and afternoons and evenings um and
YOU1000000126_S0000117	jeff showed this picture of of a rapid rise in new user enrollments and this is not a short term trend they'll be over when covid dies now
YOU1000000126_S0000118	this drove in online education has been a long term trend but only accelerated by covid
YOU1000000126_S0000119	and you know what with these millions of learners all round the world learning new habits they teaching themselves how to learn online
YOU1000000126_S0000120	i feel like as a as an instructor i've been teaching ah my stanford classes online by zoom
YOU1000000126_S0000121	ah just as i had to learn new skills our students our learners are having to learn new skills to succeed in learning online
YOU1000000126_S0000122	and hopefully ah more countries will emerge from lockdown soon but even when can all re-open our campuses
YOU1000000126_S0000123	ah when social distancing can be ah relaxed
YOU1000000126_S0000124	the skills that these millions or tens of millions or hundreds of millions of online learners are learning right now they won't forget these skills
YOU1000000126_S0000125	and this creates an opportunity for us to keep on using the digital medium to keep on serving them even after covid is over
YOU1000000126_S0000127	i like this quote by ah one of the partners at ideo who said that the virus seems like an accelerator for additional change that was already underway
YOU1000000126_S0000128	and that this digital mindset will persist and it's highly unlikely that companies or universities or students will try to return to one world prior to the pandemic
YOU1000000126_S0000129	um patrick brothers during panel also said that what might happen what we preserve previously thought might happen over the next ten years
YOU1000000126_S0000130	will now maybe happen over the next two years
YOU1000000126_S0000131	and this always change i feel like um digital pedagogy is still in fancy
YOU1000000126_S0000132	you know i've been teaching online for a long time ah in the project coursera for the videos of youtube running a lot experiments many which when frankly when when nowhere but
YOU1000000126_S0000133	ah even today i feel that online pedagogy the way we would teach online with interactive learners it still isn't infancy
YOU1000000126_S0000134	i've been teaching my ah on campus i guess my stanford class using flipped classroom for many years now
YOU1000000126_S0000135	um with online digital content auto grading and recently like everyone knows had to move the live portion of that class to zoom
YOU1000000126_S0000136	and i've really enjoyed and and on one time i missed the deeper you know emotional connection with learners
YOU1000000126_S0000137	and see people out in university and getting to shake hands after class
YOU1000000126_S0000138	ah but on the flip side i've really enjoyed interacting with my students in real time live chats
YOU1000000126_S0000139	ah previously when i ask the question in class one person you know will will get the answer
YOU1000000126_S0000140	now i routinely ask questions in zoom chat and ask every single student in the class to answer
YOU1000000126_S0000141	and i really like that everyone in my classroom ah digital classroom now gets to participate
YOU1000000126_S0000143	and even though the world's been doing been participating in online education for a long time you know
YOU1000000126_S0000144	eight years coursera maybe many decades as a society there is still so much more we can do
YOU1000000126_S0000145	you heard ken ah talk about peer grading using machine learning
YOU1000000126_S0000146	i'm really excited about the coursera labs for our project guided guided project work features that normally talks about ah shaolin and um ah the talk about many new product features
YOU1000000126_S0000147	and when i look at where online education is now and how much better we can make the experience still in the future
YOU1000000126_S0000148	i think there's still so much to do and i'm very confident that five years from now we look back at this incredibly rudimentary things we're doing back in twenty twenty and say
YOU1000000126_S0000149	wow those things we thought were so advanced in twenty twenty boy that was that was so ancient and so arcade
YOU1000000126_S0000150	and we can deliver such a better live experience to our learner right now
YOU1000000126_S0000152	and you know i saw we we saw in our newspaper articles about the ah shortage of jigsaw puzzles
YOU1000000126_S0000153	ah you know because of ah social distancing at shelton place the world doesn't have enough jigsaw puzzles and you know may making new jigsaw puzzles is really hard it's really complicated
YOU1000000126_S0000154	um but the nice thing about what we can do teaching online is
YOU1000000126_S0000155	um if if we have digital jigsaw puzzles the software apps of digital puzzles that can be replicated out still very quickly so
YOU1000000126_S0000156	additional innovations one of the things that as we innovate as we come up new forms of pedagogy our community all of you the teachers represented here
YOU1000000126_S0000157	um we can quickly take those ideas and replicate that to learn this all round the world because the digital medium is easy to scale up
YOU1000000126_S0000159	so with all of the challenges we face and with all of the opportunities
YOU1000000126_S0000161	i think we come back to this fork in the road
YOU1000000126_S0000163	um we do face significant the the the world face significant challenges
YOU1000000126_S0000164	ah ted talks about from universities maybe at a higher risk of closure and
YOU1000000126_S0000165	the challenges that society faced and the challenges that all of us in higher education face is creating a fork on the road
YOU1000000126_S0000166	where on one hand we could keep on doing businesses as usual
YOU1000000126_S0000167	and maybe some of institution will be okay if we do it very robust some very robust institutions with higher education
YOU1000000126_S0000168	um and and and maybe we could have instructors teach on zoom but keep a lot of things the same and maybe maybe some of the institutions will do okay
YOU1000000126_S0000170	um but i hope that all of us will step up and rethink how we can best be hopeful to the world because
YOU1000000126_S0000172	with society in crisis with society reaching us out to us for help with unemployed learners with people needing hope
YOU1000000126_S0000173	getting an education because the learning cannot stop um even when people are at home i think it is incumbent on all of us
YOU1000000126_S0000174	as leaders in education to step up and rethink how we can help the world
YOU1000000126_S0000176	i think this maybe a moment that if we as a community no one of us alone can do this
YOU1000000126_S0000177	but if we as a community can rethink how we can use digital tools to serve all of these people so that really willing to accept digital learning
YOU1000000126_S0000178	then the opportunity is greater than ever and i hope we can build a world greater world across time zones
YOU1000000126_S0000179	and build a world where your education doesn't need a passport
YOU1000000126_S0000181	like most work found ever as this will be hard work but everyday um i remain grateful to all of you
YOU1000000126_S0000182	to coursera's partners students um on moving forward to build this world
YOU1000000126_S0000183	where anyone in the world can have an access to great education
YOU1000000126_S0000184	and i like to close um just by thanking all of you again
YOU1000000126_S0000185	when we started coursera we had no idea that over the next several years it will blossom to such a large movement
YOU1000000126_S0000186	and i am um i am under no illusions that this could not have been done but for the hard work of all of you of of all of our university partners
YOU1000000126_S0000187	um and every era education has been in crisis
YOU1000000126_S0000188	but in this moment in time that will amaze all of us that will amaze all of you more than ever and i hope that all of us will keep on working hard
YOU1000000126_S0000189	and figure out how to use these digital tools to serve learners worldwide when they need this more than ever thank you very much
YOU1000000126_S0000191	thank you andrew
YOU1000000127_S0000001	heat and drought
YOU1000000127_S0000003	rainfall that's grown unpredictable
YOU1000000127_S0000005	storms of catastrophic power
YOU1000000127_S0000007	and rising sea levels
YOU1000000127_S0000009	the forest climate court highlights the impact climate change on humanity
YOU1000000127_S0000011	the agreement emphasizes that climate change represents an allegiant and potentially irreversible threat to human societies and the planet
YOU1000000127_S0000013	and according to the report of the intergovernmental panel of climate change africa is the continent that will be most affected by climate change
YOU1000000127_S0000014	you may know that wadaita we have ah eight point nine million i d p s
YOU1000000127_S0000015	and three point nine million refugees in two thousand nineteen without fully counting two thousand twenty which is a very difficult year
YOU1000000127_S0000016	that we have challenged as humanity that that definitely the impact of covid have in all political economical and in in all social aspects
YOU1000000127_S0000017	climate change is hitting africa hardest of all although the continent has contributed the least to the crisis
YOU1000000127_S0000019	crops are rotting in fields
YOU1000000127_S0000021	herders can no longer find water for their animals
YOU1000000127_S0000023	and the covid nineteen pandemic could soon drive an another forty million people in sub-saharan africa into extreme poverty
YOU1000000127_S0000025	so peoples becoming homeless from the extreme weather events and the conflict among the community starts so that's the one who literally migrations
YOU1000000127_S0000026	we are talking today many international migrations where there are number of peoples killing themselves into mediterranean to join the europe
YOU1000000127_S0000027	but they are the huge numbers of the peoples who are internal displace who have to move from one region to another one
YOU1000000127_S0000028	and that create the conflict among those communities who have to share the resources
YOU1000000127_S0000029	how can we protect and support those who were displaced
YOU1000000127_S0000031	and what the medal ah does its the data has now much more granular data on population explosion which gives the clearer sense of the people who are more likely to be to be displaced by future with rare influence
YOU1000000127_S0000032	and it estimates with on average ah we can expect that two point eight million people to be displaced by such pheasant africa during any given withdrawing influence
YOU1000000127_S0000033	the optic temperature is more then seven degrees higher than it was one hundred years ago
YOU1000000127_S0000034	this has vast implication for example floods tropical storms droughts around the world
YOU1000000127_S0000035	this shows climate change is far more than an environmental issue
YOU1000000127_S0000036	it has crucial implications for the economy for peace and stability for security and migration policy
YOU1000000127_S0000037	it has therefore become one of the determining factors of foreign policy at large
YOU1000000127_S0000038	the impact of climate change is real not last in africa
YOU1000000127_S0000039	we are also dealing with the problem of climate apartheid right now so in the sense that the people are of paying first the brutal price
YOU1000000127_S0000040	look in a particular color those that historically carried biggest weight of the so so so
YOU1000000127_S0000041	yeah often wonder wonder impact urgency will be much more if they were more urgent
YOU1000000127_S0000042	immediate impacts happening in europe and so on
YOU1000000127_S0000043	now that's a very negative statement to start with let me just tell you why and
YOU1000000127_S0000044	basically this is known time for us to be being
YOU1000000127_S0000045	having with each other and not talking about the contradiction that are exist and not edge free giving
YOU1000000127_S0000046	absolutely serious about speke you took the part we are running out of time
YOU1000000127_S0000047	development is being underlined by climate change and we can not ignore it and we've must addressed it and we must address at our front
YOU1000000127_S0000048	i believe in saying we have also disrupt scene migration check mega keeping
YOU1000000127_S0000049	and this is the key message from my side i think we have to look all concept of migration as a part of solution
YOU1000000127_S0000050	most of the time we talk ah basically about the environmental change is the cause for migration and we frame it as a problem
YOU1000000127_S0000051	and then rarely look at at these as an opportunity as an reputational strategy
YOU1000000127_S0000052	the european in africa is an expat and the african in european is a migrant it can't continue like that
YOU1000000127_S0000054	authorities in free town have now determined to plant a million trees by twenty twenty-two
YOU1000000127_S0000056	an increase vegetation in the city by fifty percent
YOU1000000127_S0000058	that will not only help protect residence in the future but also contribute to the fight against climate change
YOU1000000127_S0000060	in addition to this commitments and from the points of view of africa this needs
YOU1000000127_S0000062	to focus on buildings resilient societies in which can adapt in place and prosper
YOU1000000127_S0000063	so that there isn't need for opportunities migration in this regard
YOU1000000127_S0000064	economic development remains one of the most effective ways to increase the capacity to adapt to climate change
YOU1000000127_S0000065	you cannot have perimetric resilience we have had economic growth well creation and massive job expansion
YOU1000000127_S0000066	and energy of course is tide to everything you need energy for the clean water and sanitation in city
YOU1000000127_S0000067	you need energy for the life in to drive industry that will create economic opportunity and growth
YOU1000000127_S0000069	so you begin to see that next source between energy water and sanitation energy and health service delivery
YOU1000000127_S0000070	there is a real need for urban planning um urban policy um which is aligned to environmental management
YOU1000000127_S0000071	ah and and housing stock recognizing this phenomenon of urbanization is here to stay
YOU1000000127_S0000072	if you are going to have an influx of people you need to plans to receive them you need to plans to deliver services
YOU1000000127_S0000073	i think the continent needs to clarify and to have the clear understanding on where it wants to go what it needs and it how's to do it
YOU1000000127_S0000074	it has to be not only top down approach but also bottom up approach fully informed by those needs
YOU1000000127_S0000075	should europe turn into even more of a fortress
YOU1000000127_S0000077	or should it instead look for more ways to make legal migration from africa possible
YOU1000000127_S0000079	climate change is a common threat to all of us no country can withdraw from the affects of global warming
YOU1000000127_S0000080	people lose their entire existence because of disasters the political stability of whole regions is at stake
YOU1000000127_S0000081	to work together to ease the affect of climate change is therefore a question of humanity that also of political rationality
YOU1000000127_S0000082	this strategy is about the e u and africa joining forces in a solid equal partnership
YOU1000000127_S0000083	to make the most of the green and the digital transformation
YOU1000000127_S0000085	together we can create decent jobs good livelihoods while also tackling climate change
YOU1000000127_S0000086	how can the international community come together to face the immense challenges ahead
YOU1000000127_S0000088	for the u n to i written an incredible ah the statutory council needs to change ah composition of security council
YOU1000000127_S0000089	ah actually reflects the realities after the second world war but it doesn't the reflect the reality of today
YOU1000000127_S0000090	we have to work not eurocentric that means we have to work together with light minor countries worth wide to see today
YOU1000000127_S0000091	that ah rules based international order is observed this cannot be done just do done by just one country by one person
YOU1000000127_S0000092	whether let a crisis go to waste there's a huge opportunity to work on where we can see how to egypt and africa will work together
YOU1000000127_S0000093	to address these challenges by shelling best practices shelling experiences and by looking at potential prospects
YOU1000000127_S0000094	i think that germany has to do no this is exceptionally my expectation
YOU1000000127_S0000095	and i am convinced at climate in use migration isn't issue at urgently need open dialogues
YOU1000000127_S0000096	between countries at multi-lateral platform to create save pass ways for migration
YOU1000000127_S0000097	to create a stateless that protect souls who are likely to become stateless
YOU1000000127_S0000098	the only failure is to give up its doable we can do it it was done before
YOU1000000127_S0000099	the the the key here is to do it differently to do it with with with creativity and to ensure the need of commitment
YOU1000000127_S0000100	um ah its about people um we should protect with the hurt of climate action
YOU1000000127_S0000101	when it comes to the continent a mobile continent is a hustle continent
YOU1000000127_S0000102	when it comes to um when it comes to a mobility a mobile continent is resourceful continent
YOU1000000127_S0000103	we always say nature is everything that we have because nature is the one who are giving us food giving us medicine even the medicine in the pharmacy
YOU1000000127_S0000104	seventy percent of it is coming from the nature and the nineteen percent from the chemical pest
YOU1000000127_S0000105	ah things that they are adding on milk but the aspirations and all the substance is always sounds like coming from nature
YOU1000000127_S0000107	and food are coming from nature we have a window of opportunity for now to the next nine years or ten years
YOU1000000127_S0000108	to increase all the ambitions and act now if we didn't do that we are going to do this no return to point
YOU1000000127_S0000110	it's time to act
YOU1000000128_S0000003	good afternoon everybody it is lovely to be back um my name is mabel van oranje and as you might know i'm ah a former co-chair of ah e c f r and i'm currently a chair emeritus
YOU1000000128_S0000004	and i'm really really excited to ah facilitate this conversation with george soros who as you all know is ah the man ah who who played an absolutely crucial role in the creation of e c f r
YOU1000000128_S0000005	um and before i hand the floor to him i i wanted to just ah maybe draw attention to one or two of the features that i find so amazing ah of george
YOU1000000128_S0000006	um because george ah is somebody who is always ahead of the curve he often sees things long before the general public actually realizes that they are happening
YOU1000000128_S0000007	and i am thinking for example about the fact that he recognized the economic crisis of two thousand eight he saw it coming ah before it even hit
YOU1000000128_S0000008	um but also i'm thinking about an issue that has really been close to his heart for more than twenty years now i think which is ah criminal justice reform in the united states
YOU1000000128_S0000009	and he's been working on twenty for more than twenty years on this and it is really good to see that ah that that is finally getting much more attention as it really deserves
YOU1000000128_S0000011	ah um it is closer to home let us get us to europe and one of these things that i've seen george do time and time again in europe is something that also really correct and that is standing up for the underdog
YOU1000000128_S0000012	and i saw him first do that in the early nineties when we were working on the war in the balkans but i've seen him do that also for example in the case of the roma
YOU1000000128_S0000013	and other minorities all over over europe refugees et cetera um so with a man who's always willing to pick a good fight to stand up for what is right and to see ahead
YOU1000000128_S0000014	ahead far ah sooner than than many of us can see i'm really really keen to hear from him what is always on his mind and where he thinks
YOU1000000128_S0000015	we should all be going george let me give you the floor thank you for being with us
YOU1000000128_S0000017	thank you good afternoon everybody
YOU1000000128_S0000019	we live in a revolutionary history at times like these the range of possibilities is far greater than in normal times
YOU1000000128_S0000021	events that are inconceivable in normal times not only become possible but actually happen
YOU1000000128_S0000023	i have developed an con entire conceptual framework based on the thin pillars of fallibility and reflexivity
YOU1000000128_S0000024	to deal with situations like the present
YOU1000000128_S0000026	that's what has allowed me to make a fortune in the financial markets
YOU1000000128_S0000028	in the very first days of january of this year i realized that we had entered a global crisis that will change the direction of history
YOU1000000128_S0000030	that's when iranian general soleimani was assassinated in iraq
YOU1000000128_S0000032	that told me
YOU1000000128_S0000033	that countries were more interested in fighting each other than in fighting climate change
YOU1000000128_S0000035	as you know climate change is a global problem and it requires global cooperation to bring it under control
YOU1000000128_S0000037	then came the novel novel coronavirus that thoroughly disrupted people's lives and added yet another global problem
YOU1000000128_S0000039	what direction will history take
YOU1000000128_S0000041	that's a question nobody can answer because the future depends on decisions that have not yet been taken
YOU1000000128_S0000043	nevertheless i believe my open society foundations are well situated to develop strategies to make the world a better place
YOU1000000128_S0000045	i personally ah focused on areas where i have experience and a historical background
YOU1000000128_S0000047	that led me to two particularly issues that are of global significance
YOU1000000128_S0000049	one is the plan
YOU1000000128_S0000051	for the international monetary fund to issue a new round of special drawing rights
YOU1000000128_S0000053	and to persuade these countries to learn ah to donate their allocations which they don't need to poor countries that are desperate for them
YOU1000000128_S0000055	to explain the idea better
YOU1000000128_S0000057	the special drawing rights are synthetic money created by the i m f
YOU1000000128_S0000059	s d rs are allocated in accordance with the member countries shareholding in the i m f
YOU1000000128_S0000061	rich countries don't need them because they can raise issue money in their own name in the international markets
YOU1000000128_S0000063	the capacity of four countries to do so is extremely limited
YOU1000000128_S0000064	that's why it's so important for rich countries ah to donate their allocations to poor ones
YOU1000000128_S0000066	as regards historically
YOU1000000128_S0000068	i am not sure if we have a technical difficulty whether we have lost george
YOU1000000128_S0000070	the connection with george
YOU1000000128_S0000072	um i am afraid we have lost the connection with george so hopefully he will he will soon come back in and reconnect
YOU1000000128_S0000074	so i please be patient
YOU1000000128_S0000076	and i'm sorry as i'm using different technology
YOU1000000128_S0000079	there you are george you're george you're back we are reconnected
YOU1000000128_S0000080	very good
YOU1000000128_S0000082	so nevertheless
YOU1000000128_S0000084	enthusiastically endorse the idea and argued that the best and perhaps only way to raise ah one or two trillion euros
YOU1000000128_S0000085	is by issuing perpetual bonds
YOU1000000128_S0000087	the distinguishing feature of professional bonds is that the principle never has to be repaid only the annual interest is due
YOU1000000128_S0000089	this makes them very efficient
YOU1000000128_S0000091	they have a cost-benefit ratio that is almost ten times greater than that of the long-term bonds that the commission is proposing to use
YOU1000000128_S0000093	this sounds almost unbelievable but it's true
YOU1000000128_S0000095	ah assuming ah o point five percent interest
YOU1000000128_S0000097	which is ah quite generous in the currently low interest rate environment
YOU1000000128_S0000099	one trillion euros would cost only five billion annually
YOU1000000128_S0000101	the interest would have to be forever be paid forever but the present value of future payments diminishes progressively
YOU1000000128_S0000102	until it approaches but doesn't quite reach zero
YOU1000000128_S0000104	most importantly perpetual bonds could be issued as soon as member states authorize sufficient owned resources
YOU1000000128_S0000105	ah to maintain the triple a rating of of the european union
YOU1000000128_S0000107	own resources would come from newly authorized taxes such as a tax on carbon emissions
YOU1000000128_S0000109	the taxes would only have to be authorized they wouldn't need to be imposed
YOU1000000128_S0000110	because that would take too long and speed is the speed is of paramount importance
YOU1000000128_S0000112	the perpetual bonds don't need to be issued in one go they could be sold in tranches
YOU1000000128_S0000114	the first tranches would be snatched up by insurance companies and other long-term investors
YOU1000000128_S0000115	who was starved of essence ah to match their liabilities
YOU1000000128_S0000117	as the market familiarize themselves with a new instrument other investors would be attracted to it
YOU1000000128_S0000119	as as as the bond market ah ah ah as the bonds became actively actively traded
YOU1000000128_S0000121	the european central bank would also be allowed to invest in them
YOU1000000128_S0000123	there is an important distinction between funds raised from the e u s own resources and those that are contributed by member states
YOU1000000128_S0000125	the latter have to be distributed to member states according to their shareholding in the in the european central bank
YOU1000000128_S0000127	the former can be given by the commission to those who most in need
YOU1000000128_S0000129	that makes all the difference to the effectiveness of of the aid that the european union can provide
YOU1000000128_S0000130	for instance
YOU1000000128_S0000132	ah it could assist those who have lost their livelihood because of the virus
YOU1000000128_S0000133	currently they have to depend on their own governments whose capacities vary
YOU1000000128_S0000134	it will be much more equitable if the support came from the european union
YOU1000000128_S0000136	ah
YOU1000000128_S0000138	i think member states ignore so studiously an instrument that is ideally suited to the to the current situation
YOU1000000128_S0000140	they were aware of perpetual bonds because spain championed them at a virtual summit of the european council on april twenty-third
YOU1000000128_S0000141	and they were listed as one of the ideas that deserved further consideration
YOU1000000128_S0000143	my guess is that the perpetual bonds were dismissed out of hand
YOU1000000128_S0000144	because the they were confused with corona bonds
YOU1000000128_S0000146	the latter were decisively rejected by member states because some of them were unwilling to go that far
YOU1000000128_S0000148	in reality perpetual bonds are the exact opposite of corona bonds
YOU1000000128_S0000150	perpetual bonds reduce the debt burden corona bonds increase it
YOU1000000128_S0000152	to avoid confusion and i'll try to avoid using that perpetual bonds
YOU1000000128_S0000154	i prefer to use the word consoles
YOU1000000128_S0000156	that's the name the u k and the u s used for centuries to deserve perpetual to describe perpetual bonds
YOU1000000128_S0000158	the u k started in seventeen fifty-two and the u s in eighteen in the eighteen seventies
YOU1000000128_S0000160	interestingly the netherlands
YOU1000000128_S0000162	predated the other two countries
YOU1000000128_S0000164	and that water board issued perpetual bonds in sixteen forty-eight
YOU1000000128_S0000165	to repair a dike
YOU1000000128_S0000167	the bonds are still outstanding
YOU1000000128_S0000168	but the annual interest has become so small that the general public is not even aware of their continued existence
YOU1000000128_S0000170	as far as i know the dutch actually invented the idea
YOU1000000128_S0000171	yet today they are the most ah ardent opponent
YOU1000000128_S0000172	they are the leaders of the so called frugal four
YOU1000000128_S0000174	in sixteen forty-eight the netherlands faced ah serious threat from flooding
YOU1000000128_S0000176	today the combination of the virus and climate change poses an even greater danger to to the european union
YOU1000000128_S0000178	if would be tragic if european general and frugal four in particular failed to give consoles the consideration they deserve
YOU1000000128_S0000180	i recognize that there are bound to be the legal objections
YOU1000000128_S0000181	based on the t f e u that contains all the rule that govern the european union
YOU1000000128_S0000183	i believe the objections could be overcome
YOU1000000128_S0000184	by arguing that the authors of the t f e u were not aware of the existence of consoles
YOU1000000128_S0000185	therefore ah ah ah ah its regulations ah doesn't apply to them
YOU1000000128_S0000187	i also an anticipate
YOU1000000128_S0000189	moral objections from german speaking people
YOU1000000128_S0000190	the german world assured has a double meaning debt and guilt
YOU1000000128_S0000192	it follows that that the debt should be the the that debtors should be punished
YOU1000000128_S0000194	that makes perpetual bonds that never have to be repaid morally inadmissible
YOU1000000128_S0000196	there is one legitimate legitimate objection that maybe be may raised
YOU1000000128_S0000198	once you start using consoles you may end up abusing them
YOU1000000128_S0000200	but the fact that the large-scale use of ah euro europe's triple a credit is already designated as a temporary measure
YOU1000000128_S0000202	that should be ah ah there ah that should ensure
YOU1000000128_S0000203	that they would not be used in nor normal times
YOU1000000128_S0000205	they are ah offer a financial tool ideally suited to current circumstances
YOU1000000128_S0000207	and they would not be abused in normal circumstances
YOU1000000128_S0000209	so why all this hostility
YOU1000000128_S0000211	i believe the answer is to be found in the sequence of events
YOU1000000128_S0000213	the commission was not aware of professional bonds when it proposed a recovery plan
YOU1000000128_S0000215	it was relying on the only instrument over which it had some control namely the budget
YOU1000000128_S0000217	that focused the attention of the member states and the interest groups
YOU1000000128_S0000218	on how are the funds are distributed not on how they were generated
YOU1000000128_S0000220	interested parties are now haggling with each other
YOU1000000128_S0000221	for instance the frugal four want to protect the their discounts from their contributions to the budget
YOU1000000128_S0000223	it is take time for the authorities to realize that the budget can generate the amount of money the european union needs
YOU1000000128_S0000225	that's when the consoles will ah will will ah will be recognized
YOU1000000128_S0000226	as an indispensable financial instrument
YOU1000000128_S0000228	but by that time it may be too late
YOU1000000128_S0000230	we must therefore accelerate the process
YOU1000000128_S0000232	the the money is needed now
YOU1000000128_S0000238	and ah ah she ah has fully recovered her political influence
YOU1000000128_S0000240	she also has capable supporters in the ministry of finance
YOU1000000128_S0000242	who understand the merits of consoles
YOU1000000128_S0000244	in addition to deal ah the dealing with the virus
YOU1000000128_S0000245	consoles should also be used to address climate change
YOU1000000128_S0000247	recently a strong movement has develop
YOU1000000128_S0000249	ah ah to ah raise the twenty-thirty climate target
YOU1000000128_S0000250	from forty percent to fifty-five percent
YOU1000000128_S0000251	a number of mainly east european countries are objecting that they didn't have enough money to reach the higher target
YOU1000000128_S0000253	that could be readily remedied with additional trillion euros of consoles
YOU1000000128_S0000254	of course the commission would have to carefully monitor that the funds are not misdirected and misused
YOU1000000128_S0000256	in this way the european union could meet the two great challenges o o of of our time
YOU1000000128_S0000257	and a fulfilled the expectations of its citizens that will be a truly great accomplishment thank you
YOU1000000129_S0000000	there were but few men in the history of humanity who have accumulated fortunes like that of andrew carnegie a man who was as complex as he was rich

YOU1000000129_S0000008	carnegie is at one point the richest american in history but he wasn't born in america
YOU1000000129_S0000009	andrew's story begins across the atlantic ocean in dunfermline scotland where he grew up in what could only be described as abject poverty
YOU1000000129_S0000010	his mother would work around the clock sewing shoes his father would make cloth and other material and weaving loom
YOU1000000129_S0000011	that was of course until the steam powered loom came into the picture with weaving technology rapidly improving his father's loom business would crumble finding himself crushed by the industrial revolution
YOU1000000129_S0000012	watching his father suffer as he begged for work would impact the young carnegie profoundly in eighteen forty-eight the carnegie set out in search of a better life outside scotland after selling all of their possessions and borrowing twenty pounds
YOU1000000129_S0000013	the family embarked on their journey to the land of opportunity america they would restart their lives from scratch in pittsburgh the hub of manufacturing but still found themselves unable to escape hardship in their new country
YOU1000000129_S0000014	his father and mother both struggled to find work leaving andrew no choice but to drop out of school to support his family he would finally catch a break from the scorching heat of the boiler rooms when he landed a job at a local telegraph office
YOU1000000129_S0000015	as a messenger boy he would deliver telegrams by bike all over pittsburgh he would memorize the faces of every one he delivered to so that he could greet them by name if he saw them outside of work
YOU1000000129_S0000016	it would provide carnegie with a unique opportunity to familiarize himself with the city's business community at seventeen he would perfect his telegraph skills he would grow increasingly skilled at hearing morse code
YOU1000000129_S0000017	impressively he could recite messages without needing to write them down this caught the eye of thomas scott a regional manager for the pennsylvania railroad company who hire carnegie to be his personal telegrapher
YOU1000000129_S0000018	and private secretary for the sum of thirty five dollars a month at the time the pennsylvania railroad company was the largest corporation in the world
YOU1000000129_S0000019	for the business savvy carnegie it was an opportunity like none other a front row seat on how to run a successful business
YOU1000000129_S0000020	thomas scott his boss realized carnegie's potential and decided to take the boy under his wing mentoring him like a second father
YOU1000000129_S0000021	it would later be thomas advice to invest in stocks that provided carnegie with his first taste of capitalism fast forward to the american civil war carnegie is drafted into the union but instead of fighting in the war
YOU1000000129_S0000022	carnegie would profit from it he was able to escape homs way after paying eight hundred and fifty dollars for a substitute to take his place on the battlefield it was during this time the carnegie noticed that the wooden bridges were easily burned by the troops
YOU1000000129_S0000023	and that there was a desperate need for iron bridges to replace them he capitalized on the opportunity launching the keystone bridge company but it would be his next move that would define him as an astute businessman
YOU1000000129_S0000024	keystone didn't just build bridges they also had their very own iron mills which provided the iron that was needed for constructing the bridges
YOU1000000129_S0000025	owning the iron sauce meant that carnegie's bridge building company would not be dependent on mining or extracting companies for iron like their competitors this not only gave carnegie more control over the entire process it also improved their margins
YOU1000000129_S0000026	after the bridge was built he would leverage his connections in the railroad industry to make money there too essentially he was operating a triad of three companies each strengthening one another
YOU1000000129_S0000027	first a mining extraction company second a bridge building company which used the iron provided from a mining company and then once the bridge was built his third business with monetized by selling rail
YOU1000000129_S0000028	the concept worked to a t
YOU1000000129_S0000029	always looking for the next big opportunity andrew set his sights on new york city the undisputed business capital of the world in the city he expected to find a hustling culture and mingled with other distinguished businessman
YOU1000000129_S0000030	but what he found instead was disappointment he would describe the wealthy individuals around him as scoundrels
YOU1000000129_S0000031	carnegie wrote a note to himself promising that in two years when he turned thirty-five he would retire and focus on making the world a better place
YOU1000000129_S0000032	but this note would go unfulfilled in eighteen fifty-six a new invention by henry bessemer called the bessemer converter
YOU1000000129_S0000034	a pear shaped furnace would allow for the mass production of steel something previously thought to be impossible for the first time ever it would finally become feasible to create large structures from steel
YOU1000000129_S0000035	eventually giving birth to the first skyscrapers forever transforming a city skyline carnegie moved with lightning speed successfully building america's first steel plant
YOU1000000129_S0000036	in doing so he hired the best engineers and architects that money could buy he focused maniacally on increasing efficiency always using the latest technology and pushing his employees to their maximum physical and mental capabilities
YOU1000000129_S0000037	he was also notorious for requiring employees to work three hundred and sixty-four days a year only allowing for rest on the fourth of july
YOU1000000129_S0000038	as technology continues to advance he would seek ways to replace his workers with machines at every possible opportunity
YOU1000000129_S0000039	unlike man machines didn't need sleep they also didn't ask for raises and they certainly did not try to unionize
YOU1000000129_S0000040	carnegie a master salesman decided to name the venture not carnegie steel but rather j edgar thompson steelworks the name of one of his customers in the railroad industry
YOU1000000129_S0000041	carnegie hoped to steel mill named after a customer would show his appreciation for their business and maybe even secure more orders from their railroad and it did the first order from thompson consisted of two thousand steel rails
YOU1000000129_S0000042	naming a mill after a customer was more than a sales gimmick it was part of a larger strategy showing appreciation in public for others
YOU1000000129_S0000043	acts like this would continue to pay massive dividends throughout the titans career to help run carnegie steel mills he would bring on board a cut throat executive known for his ruthlessness and attention to the bottom line
YOU1000000129_S0000044	henry clay frick as a team carnegie and frick were a powerful force to be reckoned with and to show how ruthless the two could be look no farther than the story about duquesne works
YOU1000000129_S0000045	with the help of frick carnegie spread a rumor which alleged that duquesne's mill was producing defective steel it wasn't true but it didn't matter
YOU1000000129_S0000046	carnegie claimed to duquesne's railroad customers for their rails liked what he called homogenetic few if anyone actually knew what the word meant but that wasn't important
YOU1000000129_S0000047	carnegie used the word because it sounded scary enough to frighten off railroads were concerned that they weren't getting good products if duquesne sales slowed they would eventually become unprofitable and run out of money
YOU1000000129_S0000048	to expedite their demise carnegie and frick would proceed to undercut duquesne on price further squeezing the company
YOU1000000129_S0000049	within two years duquesne's finances were in ruins leaving it no other choice than to sell to none other than carnegie at a bargain price
YOU1000000129_S0000050	for frick and carnegie rules of engagement were clear do whatever it takes to win but this ruthlessness came with a hefty price as they would soon discover at one of their largest steel plants in homestead pennsylvania
YOU1000000129_S0000051	carnegie had just invested millions of dollars optimizing the efficiency of homestead and enabling it to produce more steel than any other mill comparable to its size
YOU1000000129_S0000052	but there was another part of the profit machine that was yet to be optimized labor costs this posed a problem for carnegie who had been working on rebranding his image from an oppressive steel factory billionaire to a champion of worker's rights
YOU1000000129_S0000053	so instead of risking his reputation he would have his right hand lieutenant henry frick execute the dirty work meanwhile carnegie with distance himself traveling abroad to his home country scotland
YOU1000000129_S0000054	carnegie knew that he wouldn't want to be around the plant after cutting wages for ten thousand already frustrated low paid workers
YOU1000000129_S0000055	in eighteen ninety two tensions between workers and mill owners are particularly heightened after an ever widening wealth gap continued to grow the richest people in america are accumulating fortunes faster than at any time in american history
YOU1000000129_S0000056	meanwhile workers felt that they were property of the rich and the best shrinking voice could only be heard through a union to make things even worse
YOU1000000129_S0000057	frick who took his orders from carnegie demanded increased factory production which would mean even more hours slaving away but to top it all off frick would not be increasing their income
YOU1000000129_S0000058	he'd be reducing its longer hours and less pay but homestead at a boiling point the strike is also demanding safer working conditions and for a good reason
YOU1000000129_S0000059	in eighteen ninety-eight nine percent of all steel workers industrywide would die on the job when the workers refused frick's aggressive demands for longer hours and less pay he decided to lock out all employees
YOU1000000129_S0000060	and bringing a substitute group of immigrant workers who would be willing to do that dangerous jobs for less
YOU1000000129_S0000061	to escort the immigrant workers as they made their way to the factory frick called on a three hundred person army for hire called the pinkertons armed with rifles
YOU1000000129_S0000062	they made their way to the factory where they were met by ten thousand angry strikers refusing to give up what they called home
YOU1000000129_S0000063	historians don't know who fired the first gunshot but what we do know is that the day would no longer be called the homestead strike
YOU1000000129_S0000064	but rather the homestead massacre by the end of the battle nine factory workers and seven pinkertons will be dead
YOU1000000129_S0000066	hundreds would be injured the fighting was so extreme that the governor ordered for eight thousand militia troops to provide backup under the protection of the state's troops the factory would be reopened
YOU1000000129_S0000067	and unfortunately for carnegie's worker they would be returning with lower pay longer working hours and the same safety conditions
YOU1000000129_S0000068	another collateral damage from homes that came in the form of carnegie's reputation prior to the tragedies have homes that he would often advocating public for better conditions in steel mills and increased wages
YOU1000000129_S0000069	but these words were far from a line with his actions hypocrisy was incredibly prevalent while he preached increased wages and improved safety conditions
YOU1000000129_S0000070	he was simultaneously reducing labor costs by slashing paychecks and doing little if anything to make his factories a safer place to work
YOU1000000129_S0000071	carnegie was widely called a coward for using freak as a scapegoat not only for the tragedy but for all the other dirty work that he didn't want his name to be associated with
YOU1000000129_S0000072	but in spite of the tensions and animosity the steel mills continue to thrive in fact by nineteen hundred the company would produce more steel than the entire nation of great britain
YOU1000000129_S0000073	but in nineteen o one carnegie grew tired of the game and wanted to spend time with his wife and daughter
YOU1000000129_S0000074	financier j p morgan was a rising competitor in the steel industry and carnegie now nearing seventy became open to the idea of selling the company he'd spent his entire life building
YOU1000000129_S0000075	carnegie wrote on a scrap of paper what he would be willing to accept charles schwab the president of carnegie steel delivered the offer to morgan
YOU1000000129_S0000076	as the story goes j p morgan glanced at the offer and without hesitation accepted it morgan would buy carnegie steel for four hundred and eighty million dollars making carnegie the single richest man in the world at the time
YOU1000000129_S0000077	carnegie would completely cut ties with his business life and dedicate one hundred percent of himself to serving the world through philanthropy not a single dollar will be left to his family
YOU1000000129_S0000078	because andrew had only five years of schooling he had a soft spot for libraries which he credits for helping him achieve financial success he acquired
YOU1000000129_S0000079	over the course of his life he would donate over two and a half thousand libraries the cities all around the world but it wasn't all self-promotion he was generous for generosity say his name was only displayed on less than five hundred of those libraries
YOU1000000129_S0000080	one example of his generosity is carnegie hall one of new york's most recognizable landmarks built in eighteen ninety-one carnegie built and donated the building as the musical hall
YOU1000000129_S0000081	but its original name of the music hall was only change to the current version after his death and not by his request but threw the music halls board members and from nineteen o one until his death in nineteen nineteen in lenox massachusetts
YOU1000000129_S0000082	carnegie's full time job was giving away the vast wealth he had built up for himself as we mentioned at the beginning of this story carnegie was a man who was as complex as he was rich
YOU1000000129_S0000083	did he employ abusive labor techniques to keep his factories producing maximum profit yes was he hypocritical of course did he make up slander to put his competitors out of business absolutely
YOU1000000129_S0000084	while these things are all true carnegie's philanthropic impact is also equally great perplexing to say the least how can a man commit such sins and then become a saint
YOU1000000129_S0000085	perhaps he viewed donating his money as a way to atone for his business sins making money is a great feeling but an even better feeling is giving it away if you want to grow wealth and perhaps donate to noble causes like carnegie did

YOU1000000130_S0000000	henry ford one of the most influential american industrialists through his company henry transformed american life and in this video we're gonna learn how he did it starting from the very beginning
YOU1000000130_S0000002	this video is brought to you by audible and a big part of it is based on henry ford's biography which you can listen to for free on audible if you register for a free trial with the link in the description
YOU1000000130_S0000003	you should also check out real engineering's video on the manufacturing innovations of the assembly line which he explains masterfully on his channel
YOU1000000130_S0000005	by all accounts henry ford should've been a farmer born in michigan barely twenty years after it had become a state
YOU1000000130_S0000006	henry grew up at a time when farming was slow exhausting and manual which is why unsurprisingly he came to hate it with a passion but whereas most people at the time didn't have the fortune to escape what they were born into
YOU1000000130_S0000007	henry was lucky enough to get such an opportunity you see the village he was born in was just eight miles west of detroit which was rapidly becoming an industrial center thanks to the steam engine
YOU1000000130_S0000008	early on in his childhood henry encountered technology which few children his age could play around with
YOU1000000130_S0000009	he'd tinker with the watches of his better-off neighbors and by the time he was twelve he could not just take them apart but also put them back together and repair them
YOU1000000130_S0000010	his interest grew into an obsession when he got to observe a working steam engine firsthand while on a school trip to one of the rail companies in detroit
YOU1000000130_S0000011	by the time henry had become a teenager the steam engine was already making its way into the farming community coal-powered threshing machines and sawmills were becoming common sight and henry was learning how they worked and how to fix them
YOU1000000130_S0000012	at the age of sixteen he made a big leap forward when against his father's wishes he left his village to go work in detroit where any young mechanic could easily find very lucrative employment
YOU1000000130_S0000013	industry in detroit was booming and it had been doing so for close to five decades in eighteen twenty-five a canal had been dug connecting the hudson river to the great lakes which at the time were effectively the western frontier
YOU1000000130_S0000014	all the untapped resources that had not way of getting out could suddenly be moved by steamboat to new york and in the span of just fifty years detroit's population increased by a factor of ten
YOU1000000130_S0000015	with vast mines in the north producing copper and iron and lumber mills opening up virtually everywhere
YOU1000000130_S0000016	all this metal and wood sustained close to a thousand companies in detroit alone including the ones in which henry would work at over the course of the eighteen eighties
YOU1000000130_S0000017	it is during this time that henry by chance learned about the gas engine from a british magazine it was being produced in small numbers by a german engineer nikolaus otto
YOU1000000130_S0000018	and it was gaining some traction in europe but it was practically unheard of in america henry would get the chance to work on suchan engine himself in eighteen eighty-nine and he instantly recognized the advantages it had
YOU1000000130_S0000019	because it did not use steam the engine was much lighter it got rid of the heavy boiler and all the water in it because it did all the combustion internally a much more efficient process
YOU1000000130_S0000020	this also allowed the gas engine to start quickly whereas steam engines of the time needed as much as thirty minutes to heat up the water and generate enough steam to start working the gas engine was an innovation henry fell in love with
YOU1000000130_S0000021	but it was one he didn't fully understand after all he had extensive experience with steam and metal but almost none with electricity and the gas engine was fired by an electric spark
YOU1000000130_S0000022	to obtain this missing knowledge henry went to work for the local branch of the edison illuminating company
YOU1000000130_S0000023	it was generating electricity for over a thousand homes in detroit and it was doing so by using steam engines so henry was a natural hire for them whenever the engines broke henry had to fix them but whenever they were working
YOU1000000130_S0000024	he was free to do as he wished it was the perfect job that allowed him to spend his days experimenting with gas engines in eighteen ninety-three when henry had already been promoted to chief engineer at edison
YOU1000000130_S0000025	he created his first working gas engine the idea of using the gas engine to create a horseless carriage had been around in henry's mind since he first laid eyes on one but actually making that idea a reality would take years of work
YOU1000000130_S0000026	building a car in a world with no car parts wasn't easy and henry had to figure out every detail through trial and error it took him three years of constant effort to produce this the quadricycle
YOU1000000130_S0000027	a simple frame with an engine powered by ethanol and four bicycle wheels mounted onto it it had only two gears and neither one was for going in reverse but what's worse is that it had no cooling system to speak of
YOU1000000130_S0000028	thus making overheating a constant issue in its first year henry made numerous improvements to the quadricycle most notably adding a cooling system and by the time he sold it in eighteen ninety-seven for two hundred dollars
YOU1000000130_S0000029	he had driven a thousand miles in it henry built a second quadricycle and then a third one always improving the design before finally feeling confident enough in eighteen ninety-nine to start his own company
YOU1000000130_S0000031	capitalized at a hundred and fifty thousand dollars the detroit automobile company was a very ambitious venture many of the detroit elite invested in it including henry's friends from the edison company
YOU1000000130_S0000032	and everyone was eager to see what henry could create with proper capital henry's plan was very clever since he personally knew many of the industrialists in detroit by that point he'd try to build an automobile they could use in their businesses
YOU1000000130_S0000033	he leased a factory and planned to hire a hundred workers to make his new delivery wagon as he called it but it turned out that building such complex machines in high numbers was much more difficult than henry imagined
YOU1000000130_S0000034	the vast majority of the parts used in the making of the delivery wagon were produced by other companies and every time a single delivery was late the entire factory would have no choice but to stop working
YOU1000000130_S0000035	the first delivery wagon took six months to produce and no more than twenty were made in the first two years of the company's existence by the end of nineteen o two the other shareholders were sick of henry's lack of progress
YOU1000000130_S0000036	and actually voted to get rid of him now because henry held only fifteen percent of the company he had no choice but to comply
YOU1000000130_S0000037	and interestingly enough the man who took over the detroit automobile company would eventually transform it into cadillac but that's a story for a different time what matters is that henry was pushed out of his own company
YOU1000000130_S0000038	and had only a thousand dollars to his name it was back to the drawing board and this time henry would take a very different approach instead of targeting businesses with expensive machines henry would design a vehicle to be used by the average man
YOU1000000130_S0000039	you see at the time virtually all cars were high-ticket items they were mostly made by skilled craftsmen one at a time and more often than not were designed for racing which was rapidly becoming a favorite american activity
YOU1000000130_S0000040	henry envisioned turning the car from a status symbol into a commodity but doing that would not be easy and in fact it took henry twenty different design iterations before he finally got one that worked
YOU1000000130_S0000041	henry labeled his first design as the model a and worked his way through the alphabet over the next five years sustained by capital from his friends and family
YOU1000000130_S0000042	but what changed the most during this time is not the car itself but the production process henry learned the importance of having a reliable supply chain when his first company failed which is why this time around
YOU1000000130_S0000043	he tried getting as many parts as possible from the same manufacturer the one he chose will probably sound familiar the dodge brothers company a machine shop in detroit that would eventually evolve into the eponymous american brand
YOU1000000130_S0000044	the biggest game-changer of all however was henry's chance visit to a slaughterhouse in chicago he saw there something interesting a disassembly line so to speak where multiple workers would process carcasses moving down a line
YOU1000000130_S0000045	henry figured he could use the same process but in reverse an assembly line using the money he had saved from some of his earlier models which were also assembled by the dodge brothers
YOU1000000130_S0000046	henry was able to build a factory of his own in nineteen o four where he could experiment with the assembly line process by nineteen o five the ford factory employed over three hundred people that built twenty-five cars a day
YOU1000000130_S0000047	but henry still hadn't figured everything out he was producing multiple different models at the same time which prevented him from properly using an assembly line
YOU1000000130_S0000048	nevertheless there was a sign of things to come the affordable model n created in nineteen o six became the best-selling car in the u s and ford became the biggest car producer in america
YOU1000000130_S0000049	it is actually during the production of this model that henry would first use the assembly line process to at least partially assemble some of his cars
YOU1000000130_S0000050	it wasn't a full moving assembly line but nevertheless this experiment increased production by a factor of five in the same factory logistics of course was another big part of henry's success
YOU1000000130_S0000051	in nineteen o five he created the ford manufacturing company completed with its own factory that started making the engines and transmissions of henry's cars to further eliminate any possibility of delays
YOU1000000130_S0000052	but the biggest factor in henry's success came from perhaps the most unexpected place peru now this is a story you're not gonna hear anywhere else so listen carefully
YOU1000000130_S0000053	in nineteen o seven henry began construction of heat treatment plant to produce vanadium steel
YOU1000000130_S0000054	this alloy was new to america in fact few furnaces in the u s could even reach the temperature needed to manufacture it the difficulty in producing it however was worth it
YOU1000000130_S0000055	because vanadium steel was more than twice as strong as regular steel while actually being lighter now at the time vanadium metallurgy was cutting edge research
YOU1000000130_S0000056	but henry had an extremely lucky connection he was friends with the two brothers who owned the one vanadium mine in peru producing ninety-two percent of the world's supply
YOU1000000130_S0000057	joseph and james flannery had commercialized vanadium steel in europe and in the u s by selling it to rail companies but their peruvian mine was producing so much vanadium that they had to do something else with it
YOU1000000130_S0000059	they sold vanadium steel to the u s government for the construction of the panama canal but even that wasn't enough so when they met henry in nineteen o six they immediately made him an offer
YOU1000000130_S0000060	they would help him transition his entire manufacturing process to use vanadium steel it was their chief engineer that built the heat treatment plant for henry in nineteen o seven
YOU1000000130_S0000061	and it was their company that supplied ford with all the vanadium it needed for its cars the first ford car designed with vanadium steel was the model t in nineteen o eight and it was this alloy that actually made it successful
YOU1000000130_S0000062	it wasn't the cheapest car henry had made the model n and its upscale versions were actually cheaper but it didn't need to be because it was by far the best car built at the time much stronger than any competitor
YOU1000000130_S0000063	the sheer difference in quality was the only marketing henry needed and within weeks of the model t released ford received twenty-five thousand orders for it
YOU1000000130_S0000064	even though it only managed to produce seventeen thousand units for the entirety of nineteen o nine henry realized just how big of a deal the model t was which is why he built a second factory in nineteen ten
YOU1000000130_S0000065	and it is there that he would perfect the moving assembly line in nineteen thirteen during this period production would double every year in nineteen ten he built twenty thousand model ts
YOU1000000130_S0000066	and just six year later he was building over half a million at the same time henry adopted another brilliant strategy he was constantly reducing the price of his car to further increase his market share
YOU1000000130_S0000067	in fact during these six years he cut the model t's price by more than half by nineteen eighteen half of all cars in america were model ts and this trend would continue well into the nineteen twenties
YOU1000000130_S0000068	henry had begun a new age in american history the age of the automobile and it was his company that would totally dominate in its first two decades
YOU1000000130_S0000069	it wasn't until the end of the nineteen twenties that the rest of the auto industry caught up to henry but at that point he was already one of the richest men alive
YOU1000000130_S0000070	in nineteen twenty-two he actually took the time to write an autobiography where parts of this video came from and which you can listen to it for free as part of your thirty-day free trial of audible
YOU1000000130_S0000071	in his book henry not only recounts his experiences in a very eloquent fashion he also shares plenty of business advice that is actually still relevant today

YOU1000000131_S0000000	when you look at the wealthiest men alive today topping the charts are tech billionaires like jeff bezos and bill gates but actually the wealthiest businessman to have ever lived died almost a century ago
YOU1000000131_S0000001	in today's video we'll be looking at a business empire so vast that even after a hundred years of technological progress no man has managed to overtake its founder this is the history of standard oil
YOU1000000131_S0000003	this video was brought to you by dollar shave club visit the link in the description to learn about the awesome deal they're offering
YOU1000000131_S0000005	the origins of history's greatest oil monopoly are actually pretty humble it all starts in eighteen thirty-nine with the birth of john rockefeller in upstate new york he was the eldest son of a travelling merchant
YOU1000000131_S0000006	who identified himself as a botanic physician but in reality was selling the nineteenth century equivalent of homeopathic medicine
YOU1000000131_S0000007	he would spend weeks away from home and in fact would have several children with another woman who he decided to bring back home to his wife
YOU1000000131_S0000008	so they could all live together in this very confusing household john would grow up learning how to hustle people for the best deal possible and how to get the most out of every penny he got his family would rarely stay in one place for long
YOU1000000131_S0000009	and john would live this nomadic lifestyle ever since he was three years old to help his mother john would earn any money he could by raising turkeys or doing work for neighbors his intelligence was put to good use
YOU1000000131_S0000010	when the family moved to cleveland ohio in eighteen fifty-four where he got the chance to attend a proper school but less than a year later john dropped out in order to work as a bookkeeper at a local produce broker he would earn fifty cents per day
YOU1000000131_S0000011	which obviously wasn't much at the time so he would help other companies on the side but after two years of working there his bosses refused to give him a meaningful raise so he decided to one up them by starting his own produce brokerage
YOU1000000131_S0000012	thanks to his good reputation he got a loan of four thousand dollars which at the time was a huge sum john started trading hay grain and various meats and in his first year he recorded sales of half a million dollars
YOU1000000131_S0000013	of which he only got a small fraction as commissions but still it was a huge success every bank in cleveland was begging john to borrow money and he was barely eighteen years old but then in eighteen fifty-nine
YOU1000000131_S0000014	something happened that would change his life forever just a hundred miles east of cleveland the first american oil well had been discovered this marked the beginning of the pennsylvania oil rush and within a year
YOU1000000131_S0000015	four and half thousand barrels of oil would be produced now back then oil wasn't quite as valuable as it today gasoline cars hadn't been invented yet but oil could still be processed into kerosene which people would then use in lamps
YOU1000000131_S0000016	john realized however that the biggest profits to be had weren't in drilling for oil but in refining it he witnessed many people going bust before striking oil so he knew that that business was too risky for him
YOU1000000131_S0000017	instead he'd let others go through the hassle of finding the oil and he would just buy it off of them john had to wait until eighteen sixty-three for the government to build a rail line connecting the pennsylvania oil fields to cleveland
YOU1000000131_S0000018	but when that line was built john was ready for it with a long line of partners and banks ready to back him up he also assembled a team of seasoned chemists and engineers who not only optimized the refining process but also discovered various uses
YOU1000000131_S0000019	for the byproducts of refining petroleum you see the early refineries in cleveland could only operate at about sixty percent efficiency but john not only increased that percentage he also started selling all the byproducts like paraffin wax
YOU1000000131_S0000020	tar and naphtha within two years the rockefeller refinery was worth over seventy thousand dollars and was among the largest in cleveland but john wasn't done
YOU1000000131_S0000021	in eighteen sixty-five there were twenty-six competing refineries but within five years john had acquired all but four of them
YOU1000000131_S0000023	by this point his business was getting too big to handle as a partnership so in eighteen seventy he incorporated as standard oil of ohio to convince the few remaining competitors in cleveland john would simply invite them over and show them his books
YOU1000000131_S0000024	revealing that he could operate at a loss far longer than they could stay solvent in exchange for a good buyout price john would offer his competitors positions in his own company thus placing the brightest minds in the industry under his control
YOU1000000131_S0000025	of course not everyone would give up immediately and over time john eroded the price of oil and kerosene sometimes by as much as eighty percent in order to strangle competitors unsurprisingly his strategy worked
YOU1000000131_S0000026	by eighteen eighty he had acquired refineries across the northeastern u s and was refining over ninety percent of the entire country's oil production at this point john was so powerful that he would invite the owners of the big rail companies
YOU1000000131_S0000027	and personally negotiate rebates for using their trains but this practice of negotiating backroom deals really got the business world riled up at the time and still kind of today most industrial goods were transported by rail
YOU1000000131_S0000028	and many big industrialists got worried
YOU1000000131_S0000030	that john's abuse of transportation rebates could result in similar monopolization in their industries
YOU1000000131_S0000031	over the next decade businessmen politicians and the media would attack standard oil with increasing ferocity legislators in ohio began drafting antitrust regulations to bring down rockefeller but he was one step ahead
YOU1000000131_S0000032	in eighteen eighty-two he reincorporated in new jersey this time creating the standard oil trust which in turn held stakes in over forty local companies
YOU1000000131_S0000033	then to showcase his success john built an impressive headquarters for his company on broadway this moment was the high point of rockefeller's standard oil
YOU1000000131_S0000034	he owned twenty thousand oil wells four thousand miles of pipeline and employed over a hundred thousand people but his grip on the oil industry was loosening both domestically and abroad
YOU1000000131_S0000035	massive oil deposits had been discovered in russia and in asia and were being developed by the rothschild family which spared no effort in getting that oil to america
YOU1000000131_S0000036	worse yet in eighteen ninety the federal government passed the sherman antitrust act which finally gave politicians the teeth to go after the standard oil trust itself
YOU1000000131_S0000037	of course the complex legal structure behind all the companies was very difficult to investigate which is why it the government couldn't actually break up standard oil until nineteen eleven
YOU1000000131_S0000038	by that point however john rockefeller had already cashed in and was no longer actively managing the company in the final twenty years of his company's existence it had paid out over half a billion dollars in dividends
YOU1000000131_S0000039	by some estimates the true worth of standard oil at its peak was one trillion dollars so the breakup didn't really come as a surprise to most people in nineteen eleven the supreme court found standard oil guilty of anticompetitive practices
YOU1000000131_S0000040	and broke the company up into thirty-four separate entities of course john rockefeller kept his stake in those companies until his death and in fact it turns out that the breakup was the most profitable event in his life
YOU1000000131_S0000041	you see over time many of those companies merged back with one another today most of the standard remnants are part of either exxonmobil chevron or b p which have since become incredibly large companies in their own right
YOU1000000131_S0000042	john rockefeller's ownership of these successor companies made him the richest businessman to have ever lived with an estimated net worth of four hundred billion dollars even today no one has beaten rockefeller in the leaderboard
YOU1000000131_S0000043	not even jeff bezos himself seems likely to achieve that but there's one thing that jeff bezos does have that john rockefeller never did despite all his money and that is access to dollar shave club
YOU1000000131_S0000044	i mean look at him it's clear that this man cares very much about looking and feeling at his very best but guess what you too can experience the splendor of dollar shave club's daily essential starter set

YOU1000000132_S0000001	the vast and shrouded wealth of the rothschilds has endured for generations and has unsurprisingly made it hard to tell what is fact and what is fiction
YOU1000000132_S0000002	in this video we're going back to the earliest days of this famous jewish family to see how they managed to build one of the greatest fortunes in history at a time of rampant anti-semitism
YOU1000000132_S0000003	this video is brought to you by skillshare with whom i've partnered to make a series of educational videos on the stock market which you can watch for free by using the link in the description our story begins in medieval europe
YOU1000000132_S0000004	by the tenth century most of europe was under the domain of christianity political power was invariably tied to religion which made being a non-christian very unfavorable perhaps the biggest victims of these circumstances was the jews
YOU1000000132_S0000005	having no home state of their own to fall back to the jews were scattered throughout europe and many of them settled in the holy roman empire
YOU1000000132_S0000006	this vast multi-ethnic state contained modern day germany and like the rest of europe it too wasn't happy to harbor the jews
YOU1000000132_S0000007	in many cities the jews we forced to live in particular neighborhoods in what we now call ghettos and the city of frankfurt was no exception
YOU1000000132_S0000008	from fourteen sixty-two on wards it confined all the jews in the city to a single narrow street outside the city walls that street came to be known as the judengasse or the jewish alley and it was made up of numerous tightly packed houses
YOU1000000132_S0000009	back then the buildings weren't distinguished by numbers but by signs one building could be the house of the ship for example while another could be the house of the golden stone the sign on one of those houses was a red shield
YOU1000000132_S0000010	or rothschild in german and the family living in the house had gone by the same name since at least fifteen twenty-eight like most jewish families at the time the rothschilds were involved in finance
YOU1000000132_S0000011	you see in medieval europe christianity forbade anyone from lending money with interest leaving this otherwise profitable business into the hands of the jews experience with money lending and by extension anything relating to finance was passed down generations
YOU1000000132_S0000012	and the rothschilds were no exception they specialized in exchanging currencies and trading collectible coins and the best one of them all was mayer rothschild he took up the family business in seventeen sixty-three and his extensive collection of coins
YOU1000000132_S0000013	attracted the wealthiest aristocrats in the holy roman empire among them was crown prince wilhelm of hesse the prince met mayer in seventeen sixty-nine and quickly learned to trust him with all matters relating not just to collectible coins
YOU1000000132_S0000014	but to anything financial when wilhelm came into power as wilhelm ninth of hesse in seventeen eighty-five he hired mayer to manage his finances as his hofjude or court jew now keep in mind this was a common arrangement in central europe
YOU1000000132_S0000015	the nobility would outsource their finances to jews in exchange for protection money and sometimes even actual noble titles mayer oversaw the taxes collected in wilhelm's lands and had to keep his money safe
YOU1000000132_S0000016	a task that became very difficult in eighteen o six that is the year when napoleon invaded hesse driving wilhelm into exile and putting his fortune at risk but mayer was smart and he was ready for napoleon
YOU1000000132_S0000017	in seventeen ninety-eight he had sent one of his five sons nathan rothschild to london to start a currency business similar to his father's with this foundation in place mayer had no trouble moving wilhelm's fortune to london
YOU1000000132_S0000018	where he then loaned it out to the british crown in essence wilhelm was funding the british to fight napoleon in order to restore his power now mayer died in eighteen twelve leaving wilhelm's fortune and the rothschild legacy in the hands of nathan
YOU1000000132_S0000019	he remained in london while his eldest brother took over the original frankfurt business meanwhile the three remaining brothers scattered throughout europe establishing branches in important european capitals
YOU1000000132_S0000020	despite the distance the brothers applied a unified strategy they would loan out their money to the aristocracy and to local governments the brother in france for example became the banker of leopold the first of belgium
YOU1000000132_S0000021	while the one in vienna would lend money to last holy roman emperor francis the second in eighteen eighteen he would grant all five brothers the noble title of baron finally elevating the rothschilds to nobility
YOU1000000132_S0000022	throughout the next decades whenever a european government collapsed and was replaced it was the rothschilds who were first in line to provide loans that's exactly what happened after the french revolution of eighteen thirty or after the fall of the holy roman empire
YOU1000000132_S0000023	the loaning business was immensely successful the paris branch for example grew from the equivalent of five million dollars in eighteen twenty to over half a billion dollars in eighteen fifty
YOU1000000132_S0000024	in essence the five rothschild baking families back then provided the same service that the international monetary fund provides today they stabilized major currencies and provided loans to governments doing both at a great profit
YOU1000000132_S0000026	of course throughout the nineteenth century the five branches also made many private investments beyond their government loans in eighteen sixty-eight they purchased one of the most valuable wine estates in france
YOU1000000132_S0000027	in eighteen seventy-five they acquired a minority stake in the suez canal from egypt while in eighteen eighty-three they funded the development of the first major oil well in the old world challenging the rockefeller monopoly in america
YOU1000000132_S0000028	they also became majority shareholders in the diamond monopoly of de beers and in rio tinto one of the world's largest mining companies but during the twentieth century the newer generations of the five rothschild families made fewer and fewer successful moves
YOU1000000132_S0000029	in nineteen hundred the branch in naples actually became extinct when the last male heir died without children leaving his fortune to the branch in paris a somewhat amusing fate befell the branch in germany
YOU1000000132_S0000030	there the two rothschild heirs had eleven girls and not a single boy splitting up the fortune and disintegrating its power the rothschild branch in austria was doing well until hitler came to power of course
YOU1000000132_S0000031	when nazi germany annexed austria in nineteen thirty-eight the rothschilds had to sell their banking operation for a fraction of its true worth most of them escaped with whatever liquid assets they had but at least one was captured on his way out
YOU1000000132_S0000032	and in fact he was only released after paying the largest ransom in history at the time twenty one million dollars the ransom effectively bankrupted the austrian rothschilds while the nazis seized all their mansions businesses and art
YOU1000000132_S0000033	a few years later exactly the same thing happened to the branch in paris in fact the collections they had were so exquisite that hitler and hermann goering personally went there to observe them and to pick out what they liked
YOU1000000132_S0000034	through the detailed inventories compiled by the nazis we know that they seized a total of five thousand and three objects from the rothschild collections and the vast majority of them were never returned
YOU1000000132_S0000035	the french rothschilds had some luck restoring their businesses after the war but then the french socialists nationalized their bank in nineteen eighty-one in the end only the english branch survived the twentieth century with its fortune intact
YOU1000000132_S0000036	its patriarch during the second half of the twentieth century was sir evelyn rothschild who even today is the financial advisor to queen elizabeth he retired from leadership in two thousand and three passing on the mantle of patriarch to david rothschild
YOU1000000132_S0000037	a member of the branch in paris who then merged both branches into a single entity he ensured the secrecy of the family's fortune by establishing a complex network of shell companies starting off in switzerland but ending god knows where
YOU1000000132_S0000038	but at the end of the day while the nineteenth century banking family might have been one of the richest of its day today the rothschild's are a shadow of their former glory in fact if you open up the forbes list of billionaires
YOU1000000132_S0000039	the first rothschild appears at number eight hundred and twenty-two that's jeff rothschild a man who actually has nothing to do with the rothschild banking family
YOU1000000132_S0000040	he has no blood connection he just happens to share the name in the same way that two men bearing the family name goldman might not be related the first actual rothschild appearing on this list is only at number one thousand two hundred and eighty-four
YOU1000000132_S0000041	and his wealth is tied to an asset management company that manages other people's money so in the end it turns out that the once powerful rothschild family is really nothing more but a blip on the radar of global wealth
YOU1000000132_S0000042	and it honestly makes sense statistically ninety percent of wealthy families lose their fortunes by the third generation it's just hard to be financially responsible when you're born into wealth and have no respect for money
YOU1000000132_S0000043	why bother learning how to invest and grow your wealth when you can just spend whatever grandpa left you well if you want to escape this vicious cycle or at least kick the can down the road for another generation

YOU1000000132_S0000049	we'll see each other again in two weeks and until then stay smart
YOU1000000133_S0000000	the internet has completely changed the way we watch television goner the days when the whole family would gather in the living room to enjoy the exact same program as everyone else
YOU1000000133_S0000001	technology has advanced to the point where we've dumped the old immovable boxes in favor of our phones and computers in today's world you can watch whatever you want whenever you want on-demand straight from the internet
YOU1000000133_S0000002	we are now in the age of video-on-demand and so this week on behind the business we'll be taking a look at the company that lies at the heart of this recent revolution netflix
YOU1000000133_S0000004	the year is nineteen ninety-one and reed hastings was getting ready to start his first company hastings was a rather unusual tech entrepreneur
YOU1000000133_S0000005	he came from minnesota and after graduating from college and serving briefly in the military he decided to travel to swaziland with the peace corps to teach math
YOU1000000133_S0000006	after returning to the u s and getting a masters in computer science he and two of his friends started a company in nineteen ninety-one called pure software as the company sold a range of debugging tools for unix operating systems at a time when there were few good ones on the market
YOU1000000133_S0000007	and so it rapidly became a big player in the i t world it doubled its revenue every year for four years in a row and in nineteen ninety-six it was sold to rational software for seven hundred million dollars
YOU1000000133_S0000008	in the span of half a decade hastings had become a millionaire
YOU1000000133_S0000009	life seemed great but in nineteen ninety-seven he suffered an inconvenience that would eventually become a world-changer hastings had forgotten to return his video-rental of apollo thirteen and as a result was slapped with a forty dollar late fee
YOU1000000133_S0000010	he was embarrassed and didn't want to tell his wife and that got him to thinking of a solution not just a solution to his own late-fee problem but a solution to everyone's problem an entirely new system of film rental that would make late fees obsolete
YOU1000000133_S0000011	together with a friend of his on august twenty-ninth nineteen ninety-seven in scotts valley california hastings founded a brand new movie rental service called netflix with the idea of mailing d v ds to paying customers
YOU1000000133_S0000012	the creation of netflix was essentially a bet on the d v d player now the d v d player had been invented in taiwan in nineteen ninety-four by sony but it wouldn't be until march nineteen ninety-seven that one was first sold in the u s
YOU1000000133_S0000013	back then a player cost over a thousand dollars and when netflix was formed less than one percent of americans actually owned one
YOU1000000133_S0000014	in a move that seemed insane at the time hastings gambled everything on the potential of d v d technology to replace the bulkier lower-resolution videotape as the nation's format of choice
YOU1000000133_S0000015	in nineteen ninety-seven it was almost impossible for people to rent d v ds because very few places had any
YOU1000000133_S0000016	after trying over two hundred different mailing packages and testing them out by mailing them to himself hastings discovered that he could safely ship a d v d for the small cost of a first-class mail stamp
YOU1000000133_S0000017	this way netflix could guarantee that most titles would be in stock and by enclosing a stamped return mailer they could make the experience of film-rental as convenient as possible
YOU1000000133_S0000018	thus on april fourteen nineteen ninety-eight with thirty employees and an assortment of nine hundred twenty-five titles netflix opened for business
YOU1000000133_S0000019	their first offer was for a seven day rental at the price of four dollars plus a two dollar shipping fee they also introduced something that is now one of netflix's proudest hallmark smart suggestion algorithms
YOU1000000133_S0000020	once a customer had rented enough titles netflix could automatically suggest new movies that were likely to interest them nowadays when google and facebook know everything about us it's easy to take such algorithms for granted but in nineteen ninety-seven they were practically unheard of
YOU1000000133_S0000021	netflix started strong and just forty-eight hours after opening they had to upgrade their website's bandwidth due to excessive traffic they were receiving
YOU1000000133_S0000022	soon netflix signed promotional deals with toshiba hewlett-packard and sony whereby they offered free rentals to people who bought new d v d players
YOU1000000133_S0000023	in july nineteen ninety-nine netflix secured a thirty million dollar capital injections from groupe arnault which allowed them to start a subscription-based service called the marquee program
YOU1000000133_S0000024	for just under sixteen dollars per month customers could rent out as many d v ds as they wanted as long as they had no more than four d v ds at any given time no late fees no due dates it was perfect
YOU1000000133_S0000025	by that point netflix was already receiving ten thousand d v d orders every day but their total revenue was sitting at barely five million dollars compare this to blockbuster's four point five billion dollar revenue and you'll probably see why netflix decided to try to team up with them
YOU1000000133_S0000026	blockbuster was one of the oldest video rental companies and it was by far the largest with sixty thousand employees and eight thousand stores spread across the u s
YOU1000000133_S0000027	as the popularity of netflix grew everyone thought blockbuster would soon enter the market and with their vast resources they would've probably crushed their young competitor
YOU1000000133_S0000028	that is why netflix decided to act first and so in the early year two thousand they invited blockbuster to become a strategic partner and investor
YOU1000000133_S0000029	netflix would become the internet arm of the blockbuster brand dropping the netflix name altogether in favor of blockbuster dot com
YOU1000000133_S0000030	blockbuster laughed them out of the boardroom they were certain netflix would crumble as it has yet to turn a profit three years after its creation instead a few months later blockbuster partnered up with enron broadband
YOU1000000133_S0000031	a division of the energy company you probably know today for its notoriously fraudulent accounting practices
YOU1000000133_S0000033	of course at the time nobody knew that and so investors praised blockbuster's decision the situation for netflix looked grim they were losing money fast and by the end of the year they reported a net loss of fifty-seven million dollars
YOU1000000133_S0000034	despite doubts coming from all sides hastings was convinced that d v d technology would prevail the only thing that mattered to him was to simply survive until that happened and two thousand one was the year when things finally started going his way
YOU1000000133_S0000035	the price of d v d players plummeted with some going around for less than a hundred bucks two thousand one also saw the nine eleven terrorist attacks fearful americans took refuge in their homes and netflix subscriptions skyrocketed
YOU1000000133_S0000036	despite growing at an unprecedented rate netflix still hadn't turned a profit and so in two thousand two they went public to keep the company going in two thousand three they crossed the one million subscriber mark and finally had their first profitable year
YOU1000000133_S0000037	just as their fortune started to turn however in two thousand four blockbuster finally released their own online d v d mail service before long walmart also joined the fray and a three way battle to undercut one another ensued
YOU1000000133_S0000038	blockbuster and walmart however were a bit late to the party hastings admitted that if they had started two years earlier they probably would have won on an end of year conference call hastings declared blockbuster has thrown everything but the kitchen sink at us
YOU1000000133_S0000039	when the c e o of blockbuster heard that he promptly had a kitchen sink delivered to the netflix office a fairly creative way of declaring war
YOU1000000133_S0000040	as the competitors undercut one another netflix saw its brief profitability evaporate and its stock fell by seventy-five percent
YOU1000000133_S0000041	despite losing money they kept on growing and by two thousand five netflix was shipping one million d v ds every day from their assortment of over thirty-five thousand titles eventually this drawn-out battle of attrition took its toll
YOU1000000133_S0000042	and in two thousand five walmart decided to quit blockbuster followed suit and as the era of brick-and-mortar video rental came to an end so did their success in two thousand eight the same c e o that had rejected netflix was fired
YOU1000000133_S0000043	and by two thousand ten blockbuster had filed for bankruptcy netflix had emerged victorious and in two thousand seven it celebrated the delivery of its billionth d v d then in a single announcement hastings began the journey of making the very bedrock of his company obsolete
YOU1000000133_S0000044	this was his end-game the reason he had been willing to sacrifice profits for so long and the same reason he had prophetically cited back in the year two thousand video-on-demand
YOU1000000133_S0000046	netflix first started offering streaming of on-demand videos in two thousand seven and initially the service was at no additional charge at first movie rights were hard to come by and the videos available to stream on netflix were well pretty awful
YOU1000000133_S0000047	but in october two thousand eight they signed a deal with premium cable outlet starz which brought in some huge disney and sony library releases the deal cost netflix only twenty million dollars a price that they soon discovered was an absolute bargain
YOU1000000133_S0000048	the reason netflix got such a great price was because they were the only big player in town and pretty soon they signed deals with paramount m g m and lionsgate
YOU1000000133_S0000049	netflix were also pushing for partnerships with other brands and before long they were featured on nearly every major entertainment system on the planet they buddied up with apple playstation xbox nintendo wii and a bunch of other brands
YOU1000000133_S0000050	by two thousand ten nearly thirty percent of all north american broadband traffic during peak hours came from netflix they expanded into canada in two thousand ten latin america and the caribbean in two thousand eleven and europe in two thousand twelve
YOU1000000133_S0000051	two thousand eleven turned out to be a year of huge surprises for netflix in response to the ever increasing cost of content streaming licenses netflix announced the production of their first piece of original content it would be a political drama called house of cards
YOU1000000133_S0000052	featuring kevin spacey and directed by david fincher netflix managed to outbid h b o by ordering the first two seasons upfront for one hundred million dollars in october of that year however netflix made a much less successful move
YOU1000000133_S0000053	they introduced a new service called qwikster which yes is spelled with a w in reality there was nothing new about qwikster at all it was basically the spin-off of netflix's old d v d rental service
YOU1000000133_S0000054	the branding was sloppy unimaginative and just not thought-out but the public's response to qwikster was even worse netflix lost eight hundred thousand subscribers in a single month and three months later their shares had lost two thirds their value
YOU1000000133_S0000055	unsurprisingly they shut qwikster down the very next month bringing the two arms of the business back together the first piece of netflix original content was lilyhammer which aired on february sixth two thousand twelve
YOU1000000133_S0000056	it was a relative success and it paved the way for the bigger shows that were to follow in two thousand thirteen first and foremost was house of cards which first aired on february first and became one of netflix's most acclaimed titles
YOU1000000133_S0000057	airing the entire first season all at once was a bold move by netflix and it revolutionized the way people watch t v shows following the same format came arrested development in may and orange is the new black in july
YOU1000000133_S0000058	netflix continued to use suggestion algorithms to keep people glued to their computers watching series after series each available in its entirety on-demand
YOU1000000133_S0000060	these algorithms have become exponentially smarter in recent years and they can now spot gaps in the market giving netflix an edge in developing new shows
YOU1000000133_S0000061	at this point netflix can create original content based solely on what their customers want before they even know that they want it
YOU1000000133_S0000062	that strategy has worked out marvelously for them so far and in two thousand thirteen netflix received fourteen emmy nominations nine of which were for house of cards
YOU1000000133_S0000063	they continue to create original content from t v series to documentaries to movies though perhaps their faith in adam sandler with whom they are releasing four new movies is somewhat misplaced
YOU1000000133_S0000064	by the end of two thousand sixteen netflix will have released six hundred hours of new original content for the year and they will have spent a whopping six billion dollars on content acquisition this aggressive expansion is the only option they have
YOU1000000133_S0000065	with amazon and hulu knocking on the door with their own on-demand services and original content recently netflix integrated its service with comcast's x one platform a deal that could bring them upwards of four million new subscribers
YOU1000000133_S0000066	in such a competitive market however a single mistake can be deadly and there are more than enough companies out there eagerly awaiting netflix's next stumble it's still on top at the moment but the real question is how long can it stay there

YOU1000000134_S0000034	when i suddenly woke up i was thinking what if we could download the whole web and just keep the links and i grabbed a pen and started writing
YOU1000000134_S0000035	soon after i told my adviser terry winograd
YOU1000000134_S0000036	it would take a couple of weeks for me to download the web he nodded knowingly fully aware it would take much longer but wise enough not to tell me
YOU1000000134_S0000038	stanford professor and engineering consultant to google terry winograd
YOU1000000134_S0000039	larry just thinks of ways of doing things that you might not expect sergei was a lot like larry he also was someone who really wanted to think outside the box to say if that sounds like it's impossible let's try it
YOU1000000134_S0000040	it was nineteen ninety-five at stanford university when the headstrong overachievers first met
YOU1000000134_S0000042	one of their stanford professors used to say well the difference between the two of them was that sergei would just burst into my office without asking larry would knock and then burst in
YOU1000000134_S0000044	in the nineties searching the internet was rudimentary hit or miss often returning results that were useless and the process was very slow
YOU1000000134_S0000045	you type in your query you did something else while you waited for it to get the results then you went back and looked at the results and most of them were completely irrelevant
YOU1000000134_S0000046	page and brin pushed for something better
YOU1000000134_S0000048	sergei's big interest was in taking all the pages on the world wide web and trying to make sense of it trying to find patterns
YOU1000000134_S0000049	they started to do a record of back links they called them
YOU1000000134_S0000051	page noticed that behind every web page there were hundreds or even thousands of other pages that linked to it
YOU1000000134_S0000053	it was a eureka moment that would change the so-called information age
YOU1000000134_S0000055	then they realized that list of back links could be used for ranking
YOU1000000134_S0000057	show you a better page
YOU1000000134_S0000059	if a lot of other websites link to a web page that probably meant users thought it was good
YOU1000000134_S0000061	the geniuses are recognizing that this kind of algorithm could give you the kind of results that matter the most to searchers
YOU1000000134_S0000062	page and brin had their secret formula
YOU1000000134_S0000064	now it needed a name
YOU1000000134_S0000065	the guys were looking for a great name that was gonna capture the grandest vision that they had and hit upon this giant number
YOU1000000134_S0000067	one with a hundred zeros after it commonly known as googol g o o g o l
YOU1000000134_S0000068	they discovered it was owned they said you know what let's put a friendlier spelling on it
YOU1000000134_S0000070	on september fifteenth nineteen ninety-seven they registered google as a website
YOU1000000134_S0000071	and page and brin dropped out of their p h d programs to focus on attracting funding for their young company
YOU1000000134_S0000072	it wouldn't be easy investors like rob sharon were skeptical
YOU1000000134_S0000073	there were five search engines at the time and so i said maybe any one of them might be interested in the technology the world didn't need a sixth search engine
YOU1000000134_S0000075	google just didn't fit into the conventional wisdom of what a website should do which was to keep users from migrating to another page
YOU1000000134_S0000076	google did the unthinkable it helped users explore the wider web
YOU1000000134_S0000077	larry page and sergey brin have a different attitude they said we don't want a portal
YOU1000000134_S0000078	we want to get the search results to them in a split second
YOU1000000134_S0000080	the one sunday morning larry and sergei were sitting on the porch of a a stanford professor a friend of theirs
YOU1000000134_S0000081	and andy bechtolsheim one of the founders of sun microsystems pulls up in his sports car walks up gets about a ten minute demo says this is fantastic this is the next big big thing
YOU1000000134_S0000082	and writes a check on the spot for a hundred thousand dollars made out to google inc
YOU1000000134_S0000083	steven levy is senior writer of wired magazine
YOU1000000134_S0000084	this is the way things work in silicon valley you know it it it sounds astounding that someone would just write a hundred thousand dollar check and get you going
YOU1000000134_S0000085	but you have to realize that there was a a hidden pedigree to this
YOU1000000134_S0000086	they were at stanford they're professors had done this before this is a pretty good bet we might lose a hundred thousand dollars but we could win big there
YOU1000000134_S0000087	and at the time we had no company at all
YOU1000000134_S0000088	and in fact we couldn't cash the check
YOU1000000134_S0000090	this by the way with no legal documents you know none of that stuff
YOU1000000134_S0000092	and even though they had the seed money they still needed much more cash no one was buying into google
YOU1000000134_S0000093	they went back to rob sharon
YOU1000000134_S0000094	they found three other investors and together we raised enough money to get them off the ground
YOU1000000134_S0000096	enough money was one million dollars including two hundred and fifty thousand dollars from jeff bezos of amazon dot com
YOU1000000134_S0000098	page and brin incorporated google on september fourth nineteen ninety-eight and they moved into one of those storage garages in menlo park
YOU1000000134_S0000099	they attracted the attention of two well known silicon valley venture capitalists michael moritz of sequoia capital and john doerr of kleiner perkins
YOU1000000134_S0000100	both wanted an exclusive deal brennan page said no deal
YOU1000000134_S0000101	they had the presence of mind at the tender age like twenties then they say we won't take money from only one venture capitalist
YOU1000000134_S0000102	we want to assure that neither one of them have controls who wanna to split it
YOU1000000134_S0000103	in june of nineteen ninety-nine google issued its first press release announcing the investment twenty-five million dollars
YOU1000000134_S0000105	brin and page now needed to hire first rate engineers people who would meet their exacting standards
YOU1000000134_S0000106	chris soccer is a former googler
YOU1000000134_S0000107	it was one of the most intense hiring processes of any company in the world i had somewhere between twelve and fifteen interviews over just a couple of days
YOU1000000134_S0000108	they created a headquarters they called the google plaques offering employees services like free food and childcare and developed the informal company motto of don't be evil
YOU1000000134_S0000110	but google still wasn't making money
YOU1000000134_S0000111	larry would come in and say well how are you gonna make money from this he just gave us a smile and say well we'll figure that out
YOU1000000134_S0000113	google co-founders larry page and sergey brin had created a new search engine but have yet to find a way to turn it into a profit
YOU1000000134_S0000114	they didn't like the idea of using advertising to cash in
YOU1000000134_S0000115	at first they thought advertising was grubby commercial kind of unseemly
YOU1000000134_S0000116	their famously sparse homepage was originally designed by sergey brin
YOU1000000134_S0000117	unlike rivals yahoo and a o l page and brin refused to clutter their home page with ads
YOU1000000134_S0000118	we won't take any ads on the homepage because we think to build user trust we want to not feel like we're bogging them down with advertisements
YOU1000000134_S0000119	yet no ads at all meant no revenue
YOU1000000134_S0000120	page and brin had to accept advertising as their only option
YOU1000000134_S0000121	there were search engines in the early days which when you went to a page the first few things which looked just like regular search results happen to be things that the sponsors of those had paid the search engine to put there
YOU1000000134_S0000122	and they said that's not good for users i don't want the things that somebody else wants me to see i want the things that i wanna see
YOU1000000134_S0000124	then they found a compromise they could live with
YOU1000000134_S0000125	they invented a new way of targeting text ads triggered by search requests
YOU1000000134_S0000126	instead of distracting pop-ups or flashing ads these small ads were placed above and next to search results
YOU1000000134_S0000127	it's familiar now but revolutionary back then
YOU1000000134_S0000129	they called it google ad words
YOU1000000134_S0000130	businesses big and small could take control of their advertising dollars by purchasing ads key to certain words
YOU1000000134_S0000132	david thacker was a project manager on ad words
YOU1000000134_S0000133	advertisers love the system because they only pay when someone actually clicks on the ad
YOU1000000134_S0000134	for many advertisers it's the most efficient form of marketing they ever have
YOU1000000134_S0000135	for businesses it was the holy grail a direct connection to their best customers with a massive new revenue source google exploded
YOU1000000134_S0000136	by september of two thousand it had indexed a billion u r ls and was available in fifteen languages
YOU1000000134_S0000138	still with all of google's success few people outside silicon valley knew who had created it
YOU1000000134_S0000140	sergey brin went on to tell the truth
YOU1000000134_S0000142	and fool the judges
YOU1000000134_S0000143	will real sergey brin please stand up
YOU1000000134_S0000145	but media moguls knew exactly who they were
YOU1000000134_S0000146	barry diller was one of the first traditional media executives to visit those guys
YOU1000000134_S0000147	barry is sitting there with his p d a his little hand held devices looking down and doing his email
YOU1000000134_S0000148	and he says larry please i am talking to you can we just converse
YOU1000000134_S0000149	and he says i can do both barry diller says no you can't have both choose he says i choose this
YOU1000000134_S0000151	tremendous growth came other challenging issues for the search giant google
YOU1000000134_S0000152	the venture capitalists behind the company michael moritz and john doerr were pressuring its co-founders to hire a c e o
YOU1000000134_S0000153	their resisted but they don't wanna say you know we could do it but they thought they could do it
YOU1000000134_S0000154	they went through twelve thirteen fourteen interviews
YOU1000000134_S0000155	they don't like any of the people that they saw
YOU1000000134_S0000156	they visited steve jobs just to meet him because he was a hero of theirs and they said to john doerr after the meeting why can't he be our c e o
YOU1000000134_S0000157	john doerr introduced page and brin to eric schmidt a businessman with an engineering background
YOU1000000134_S0000159	please come over to run google
YOU1000000134_S0000160	yes
YOU1000000134_S0000161	what what's the idea behind that you guys couldn't run it yourself
YOU1000000134_S0000162	yeah ah parental supervision
YOU1000000134_S0000163	to be honest you know
YOU1000000134_S0000164	eric is a grown-up in in the room i mean he's in his mid fifties not mid thirties he's got a lot of experience
YOU1000000134_S0000165	he's more of a diplomat than they are and that's needed in dealing with the traditional media world which they increasingly bumping up against
YOU1000000134_S0000167	by the end of two thousand and one eric schmidt was google c e o page became president of products and brin the president of technology
YOU1000000134_S0000168	the two founders still shared an office
YOU1000000134_S0000169	they have a mind now they anticipate each other's words they back each other up there is no sense of tension between them that's one of the greatest strengths of their company
YOU1000000134_S0000170	with eric schmidt in place google kept up its spectacular growth while its rivals slowly faded away
YOU1000000134_S0000172	the search engine links to three billion web pages and forged a partnership with a o l which brought them thirty-four million new customers
YOU1000000134_S0000174	you have this incredibly profitable company how are you gonna to get us to the next level how are you gonna provide the kind of capital growth that they needed
YOU1000000134_S0000176	the solution it was time for google to go public
YOU1000000134_S0000177	being unconventional they decided that they were gonna hold an i p o unlike any that wall street had ever seen they were gonna set the price via an auction to determine and try to extract the greatest value from the stock
YOU1000000134_S0000179	the stock price on august nineteenth two thousand and four closed to just over one hundred dollars a share making the company worth more than twenty-three billion dollars
YOU1000000134_S0000180	the two founders became billionaires
YOU1000000134_S0000182	soon the company expanded with google maps google news and google earth
YOU1000000134_S0000184	their idealism and bold ideas had built their reputation but the company was stumbling with their free email service
YOU1000000134_S0000186	gmail was a great product that was really poorly launched
YOU1000000134_S0000187	when users saw ads pop up that were directly related to their personal emails alarms went off
YOU1000000134_S0000188	when people first saw these ads they were shocked because they thought how could these ads be so targeted you know i'm reading this this email about ah you know my friend's vacation to hawaii and i'm getting ads about hawaii is somebody snooping into my email
YOU1000000134_S0000189	the concern around gmail launched a much deeper fundamental argument about privacy and trust
YOU1000000134_S0000190	do you know how google is using all the information it collects on you
YOU1000000134_S0000191	all of the web searches that i've done for years and years all of the emails that i've done potentially information about health records information about the books that i'm looking at information about where i'm going because i'm typing it into google maps
YOU1000000134_S0000193	in a sense they're the big brother that we've been talking about all these years
YOU1000000134_S0000195	the ultimate big brother was about to put their don't be evil philosophy to the test
YOU1000000134_S0000197	in two thousand and six google reached an agreement with china for access to their four hundred million web users
YOU1000000134_S0000199	with one condition they censor search results of banned topics
YOU1000000134_S0000201	for brin son of russian immigrants it was a troubling decision
YOU1000000134_S0000202	at google's friday meeting sergey spoke with passion about growing up in a soviet union house and that his parents literally escaped the soviet union to come to america and what that meant to him
YOU1000000134_S0000203	and then a dialogue happened including everybody they wanted to hear from all the employees there
YOU1000000134_S0000204	sergey swallowed hard but they all said that at google this is the biggest consumer market in the world we have to be here
YOU1000000134_S0000206	google agreed to chinese demands
YOU1000000134_S0000207	i know there was a lot of controversy surrounding that and we have to self ah censor ah a fair amount but we were actually able to censor less and less
YOU1000000134_S0000208	and our local competitors there also censored less and less
YOU1000000134_S0000209	so i feel like our entry
YOU1000000134_S0000211	made a big difference
YOU1000000134_S0000212	ah but things ah started going downhill
YOU1000000134_S0000214	google discovered a cyber attack on their systems
YOU1000000134_S0000216	more troubling thing to me is that we discovered the motivation ah which we believed to be to gain access to gmail accounts in particular for chinese human rights activists
YOU1000000134_S0000217	google pulled the plug and redirected users to an unfiltered site in hong kong that isn't subject to censorship
YOU1000000134_S0000218	it's real life
YOU1000000134_S0000219	yeah this is real life
YOU1000000134_S0000221	youtube began as a place for people to share home videos it soon grew into one of the world's top search engines
YOU1000000134_S0000222	by july two thousand and six users were up loading sixty-five thousand videos a day and google wanted in
YOU1000000134_S0000224	they went out and acquired youtube for one point six five billion dollars in google stock
YOU1000000134_S0000225	youtube founders chad hurley and steve chen were thrilled
YOU1000000134_S0000226	today we have some exciting news for you we've been acquired by google yeah thanks
YOU1000000134_S0000228	in two thousand and six google c e o eric schmidt acknowledged that to stay competitive the company also had to enter the world of mobile phones
YOU1000000134_S0000229	in fact a year earlier they had quietly bought another start-up android a small company with software for cell phones
YOU1000000134_S0000230	there are so many more mobile phones than personal computers as people do more and more searches on mobile phones it should eventually balance out again this would be many years
YOU1000000134_S0000231	it didn't take years
YOU1000000134_S0000232	apple's phenomenal success with the iphone in two thousand and seven set a collision course between the two companies
YOU1000000134_S0000233	hey guys i'm very excited to be here today
YOU1000000134_S0000234	months later brin and page announced their android operating system would run on a variety of mobile phones
YOU1000000134_S0000236	their long-time idol steve jobs slammed google for entering the phone business and accused them of trying to kill the iphone
YOU1000000134_S0000238	at the google developer conference in may of two thousand and ten google's vice president of engineering tore into apple
YOU1000000134_S0000239	if google did not act we faced a draconian future
YOU1000000134_S0000240	a future where one man one company one device one carrier would be our only choice
YOU1000000134_S0000241	that's a future we don't want
YOU1000000134_S0000243	and google is battling with another giant in the tech world
YOU1000000134_S0000244	they pop up against microsoft in so many ways they have a browser chrome microsoft has internet explorer
YOU1000000134_S0000245	google also acquired companies that dealt with online versions of word processing software and spreadsheets
YOU1000000134_S0000246	things that directly go after microsoft jugular with their office products
YOU1000000134_S0000247	microsoft fired back with its own search engine bing which debuted in spring of two thousand and nine
YOU1000000134_S0000248	can i ask what you make of bing do you like it
YOU1000000134_S0000250	um ah i think ah
YOU1000000134_S0000251	you a bing user
YOU1000000134_S0000252	ah oh yeah no no i i i use i use all search engines out there
YOU1000000134_S0000253	ah i think that what bing reminded us ah ah the the search is a very competitive market
YOU1000000134_S0000254	bing ironically offered google protection by letting them dodge accusations of being a monopoly
YOU1000000134_S0000256	bill gates said this is the company that is closest to us as a competitor
YOU1000000134_S0000257	they are just as hungry and as ruthless you can use that word but i am as we are there is a danger they make a lot of enemies
YOU1000000134_S0000258	it's a blind spot because these two founders really think of themselves as noble men
YOU1000000134_S0000259	they think that what they're doing is good for the world they've always enjoyed feeling like the underdog feeling like the evil empire was microsoft
YOU1000000134_S0000260	and now they've discovered that some people think they're the evil empire
YOU1000000134_S0000261	their own slogan do no evil was suddenly being used against them
YOU1000000134_S0000263	google's quest on the road to organize the world's information took a new turn called it a detour with an ambitious feature they called street view and attempt to photograph every neighborhood on the planet
YOU1000000134_S0000265	it would eventually include ordinary images from main street
YOU1000000134_S0000267	extraordinary views of antarctica
YOU1000000134_S0000270	many people felt their privacy had been compromised
YOU1000000134_S0000271	google acknowledged the mistake and agreed to destroy data
YOU1000000134_S0000273	the company known for search was struggling to diversify and was facing an aggressive new challenger mark zuckerberg
YOU1000000134_S0000275	facebook's one billion users spend more time on the social network posting valuable information that is invisible to google search engine
YOU1000000134_S0000276	information that all advertisers chase
YOU1000000134_S0000277	so far google's efforts at social networking have failed but its founders are keenly aware that its users habits on the web change
YOU1000000134_S0000278	google will have to make a lot more friends
YOU1000000134_S0000280	in january two thousand and eleven in a startling silicon valley shake-up eric schmidt announced that google was simplifying its management structure
YOU1000000134_S0000281	and that larry page was ready to lead and would take over from him as c e o
YOU1000000134_S0000282	co-founder sergey brin will focus on new products
YOU1000000134_S0000283	schmidt tweeted day-to-day adult supervision no longer needed
YOU1000000134_S0000285	in fourteen years google grew from start-up to technology giant hitting fifty billion dollars in revenue in two thousand and twelve
YOU1000000134_S0000287	in the space of a year larry page and sergey brin both got married
YOU1000000134_S0000289	page married stanford bio informatics p h d lucinda southworth in december two thousand and seven on richard branson island branson was also his best man

YOU1000000134_S0000293	google dot org its philanthropic arm has contributed over one hundred million dollars to various organizations from clean energy to global health
YOU1000000134_S0000295	larry page and sergey brin have changed the way we get information
YOU1000000134_S0000296	it's been a a great experience for me to see them grow over the last twelve years that i've known them ah i i feel extremely proud of what they've accomplished
YOU1000000134_S0000297	larry and sergei always had this kind of irreverence as part of their attitude which is what made them so creative it's great
YOU1000000134_S0000298	i think google attracts people who care who care about users who care about the fellow feeling who care about the planet and just can't sit still they built a company that absolutely changed the world
YOU1000000135_S0000000	spacex and tesla you would be hard pressed to find two companies that are more popular today
YOU1000000135_S0000001	and yet in the not too distant past both companies were basically unknown and were in fact simultaneously on the verge of bankruptcy
YOU1000000135_S0000002	today we'll learn how elon musk did what no other american c e o had ever done before he created and then rescued two companies at the same time
YOU1000000135_S0000003	and brought them both to multi billion dollar valuations
YOU1000000135_S0000005	this video is brought to you by audible and the story presented in it is just one chapter of elon musk's awesome biography
YOU1000000135_S0000006	which you can listen to for free as part of your thirty-day free trial if you register with the link in the description
YOU1000000135_S0000008	in the early two thousand elon musk achieved what any entrepreneur would dream of achieving he successfully sold his company for over a billion dollars
YOU1000000135_S0000009	he personally received a hundred and sixty-five million and now this is where most people would call it quits but for elon this was just the beginning
YOU1000000135_S0000010	he wanted to change the world for the better and one of his ideas was to send a greenhouse to mars
YOU1000000135_S0000011	in order to boost public interest in space exploration and hopefully increase nasa's budget
YOU1000000135_S0000012	the idea was outlandishly ambitious especially because elon wanted to spend no more than twenty million dollars on it
YOU1000000135_S0000013	now at the time sending just five hundred pounds to orbit could easily cost upwards of thirty million but elon had a plan
YOU1000000135_S0000014	he traveled to russia where he trying to buy refurbished intercontinental ballistic missiles
YOU1000000135_S0000015	but the lowest price the russians gave him was eight million dollars a piece about fifty percent above his budget for the rocket itself
YOU1000000135_S0000016	on the way back from moscow elon did some back-of-the-napkin calculations
YOU1000000135_S0000017	he figured out that the raw materials used in the making of a rocket were only about three percent of the final sales price
YOU1000000135_S0000018	instantly elon knew what he had to do if he wanted to send anything to mars he'd have to build himself a vertically integrated rocket company
YOU1000000135_S0000019	to that end he read several books on rocketry from the cold war and in june two thousand and two he incorporated space exploration technologies or spacex for short
YOU1000000135_S0000020	he then set about recruiting the right people who could make his vision a reality
YOU1000000135_S0000021	his ideal candidate was young single educated and ready to give up his social life for spacex
YOU1000000135_S0000022	elon's recruitment strategy was very straightforward
YOU1000000135_S0000023	he'd basically co-op anyone fitting that profile from fresh aerospace graduates to the rising stars in boeing and lockheed martin
YOU1000000135_S0000024	at first people thought elon was making pranks but within a year he had assembled some of the brightest engineers in america
YOU1000000135_S0000025	together they would design almost everything for spacex from the engines and rocket bodies to even smallest details like the circuitry
YOU1000000135_S0000026	in many cases the engineers could build stronger and more lightweight components at just a fraction of the regular price
YOU1000000135_S0000027	these components would be used to build the merlin engine which in turn would power elon's first rocket the falcon one
YOU1000000135_S0000028	development was far from smooth of course but nevertheless progress was being made but then elon decided to up the ante
YOU1000000135_S0000029	in early two thousand and four he participated in the funding round of a new electric car company called tesla
YOU1000000135_S0000030	he personally invested a little over six million and in return became the chairman of the company's board
YOU1000000135_S0000031	right off the bat elon began applying his experience from spacex at tesla
YOU1000000135_S0000032	the company's logo for example was created by the same people that made the logo for spacex
YOU1000000135_S0000033	and of course elon was quick to use the same aggressive hiring strategy he used to assemble the spacex team
YOU1000000135_S0000034	this time however instead of poaching employees from boeing he was hiring from apple
YOU1000000135_S0000035	before long the tesla team was working on their first electric car the tesla roadster back at spacex engineers were clocking in sixty-hour workweeks
YOU1000000135_S0000036	while elon was promising very ambitious timelines
YOU1000000135_S0000037	in fact his original estimate was to launch the falcon one in november two thousand and three just eighteen months after the company was founded
YOU1000000135_S0000038	of course that estimate got pushed back and the falcon one wouldn't lift off until march two thousand and six
YOU1000000135_S0000039	when it spent a total of forty-one seconds in the air before crashing down violently like for spacex two thousand and six was a big year for tesla
YOU1000000135_S0000040	in july the tesla roadster made its first official appearance and recorded one hundred pre-orders in its first day
YOU1000000135_S0000041	but like with the falcon one the actual production wasn't going very well tesla's c e o at the time was martin eberhard
YOU1000000135_S0000042	and like elon he was promising unrealistic timeframes at first the idea was to deliver the roadster in early two thousand and seven
YOU1000000135_S0000043	but an escalating series of production issues pushed the release date further and further away
YOU1000000135_S0000044	in the end martin's mismanagement of the roadster project got him ousted from the very company he had founded leaving elon in charge of everything
YOU1000000135_S0000045	with full responsibility over both companies the stress was starting to pile up
YOU1000000135_S0000046	elon witnessed the second failure of the falcon one rocket which didn't complete its only two thousand and seven flight
YOU1000000135_S0000047	at tesla elon struggled fixing the mess left behind by eberhard and in fact the roadster's production would not begin until march two thousand and eight
YOU1000000135_S0000048	but then things got worse in august elon launched his third falcon one
YOU1000000135_S0000050	which never made it to orbit and then just one month later his wife publicly announced their divorce
YOU1000000135_S0000051	both of elon's companies were struggling to make a viable product and were running out of money fast
YOU1000000135_S0000052	in fact by late october tesla had only nine million dollars left to fund the entire company salaries were being delayed and elon was faced with a choice
YOU1000000135_S0000053	he had already spent seventy million dollars on tesla and a hundred million on spacex
YOU1000000135_S0000054	with what little he had left elon had to choose whether to fund and secure the future of one company or to risk everything and gamble on saving both
YOU1000000135_S0000055	fate gave elon little time to think the fourth and potentially final flight of the falcon one was approaching
YOU1000000135_S0000056	on september two thousand and eight elon got ready for his last chance to survive he stood in the spacex control center in l a and waited in silence
YOU1000000135_S0000057	then the rocket took off and the center burst out in ecstatic applause spacex had finally delivered a working product
YOU1000000135_S0000058	the falcon one became the first privately developed rocket to go into orbit around earth but elon wasn't in the clear just yet
YOU1000000135_S0000059	working product would mean nothing if the company behind it went bankrupt
YOU1000000135_S0000060	in a frantic scramble elon had to figure out funding solutions for both his companies before the end of two thousand and eight and the timing couldn't have been worse
YOU1000000135_S0000061	one of the largest american banks lehman brothers had collapsed and the global economy was heading towards disaster
YOU1000000135_S0000062	in the midst of this elon was raising all the personal funds he could to save tesla he liquidated his few remaining assets and even got his cousins to pitch in
YOU1000000135_S0000063	but getting investors on board doesn't happen overnight and december was creeping in
YOU1000000135_S0000064	elon had managed to scrape together twenty million dollars himself another twenty million from various investors and fifty million from the german car company daimler
YOU1000000135_S0000065	days before christmas it seemed as if only tesla was going to make it
YOU1000000135_S0000066	but then on december twenty-third elon received a very unexpected call
YOU1000000135_S0000067	nasa had awarded spacex with a one point six-billion dollar contract to resupply the international space station
YOU1000000135_S0000068	then on christmas eve the tesla deal went through elon had successfully saved both companies from bankruptcy
YOU1000000135_S0000069	in later interviews he'd recall these final days in december in painful detail
YOU1000000135_S0000070	ah but i remember waking up on the sunday before christmas in two thousand and eight and thinking like damn this is the closest i've ever gotten
YOU1000000135_S0000071	and it was looking pretty grim because at that point you know we even though the fourth launch of spacex had succeed we were still running out of money
YOU1000000135_S0000072	because we had three failures and only one success still not enough
YOU1000000135_S0000073	and ah and then the financing round for tesla had not closed and we had only two days maybe three two i think it was two or three days maybe to close it before christmas
YOU1000000135_S0000074	so i was like man this is this could be really bad end of the year maybe both companies will fail
YOU1000000135_S0000075	so regardless of the struggles elon might be facing today it's worth knowing that ten years ago he overcame the impossible
YOU1000000135_S0000076	now this story is just a brief chapter in the journey of elon musk if you'd like to read the whole thing you should check out elon musk's biography

YOU1000000135_S0000081	see you again in two weeks and until then stay smart
YOU1000000136_S0000001	on the night of november the twelve nineteen forty-four two hundred young air men set off on one of the most daring raids of the second world war
YOU1000000136_S0000003	there's a target going do it
YOU1000000136_S0000005	at the time we just got on and did it there
YOU1000000136_S0000007	and that is our job
YOU1000000136_S0000009	seventy years ago their target was lurking in a norwegian fjord deep inside the arctic circle the allies had already attacked it on thirty-three separate occasions
YOU1000000136_S0000011	we were beginning to think that it really was unsinkable
YOU1000000136_S0000012	they told us and what this is the strongest ship of the world and it never can sink
YOU1000000136_S0000013	the target was the battleship
YOU1000000136_S0000015	hitler called it the pride of the german navy churchill named it the beast and he was willing to risk the area's finest units nine squadron and the dam busters to sink it
YOU1000000136_S0000017	it never occurred to us if we were in danger the chap on the side of us may have been but we weren't
YOU1000000136_S0000018	that day the dam busters should have been shot out of the sky
YOU1000000136_S0000020	we uncover new evidence to help explain one of the luckiest escapes of the war
YOU1000000136_S0000022	and perhaps for the final time key participants in one of the most audacious raids of world war two tell their story
YOU1000000136_S0000024	we said to ourselves well we've sunk the beast at last
YOU1000000136_S0000026	seventy years after the sinking of the battleship tirpitz historian patrick bishop is exploring the norwegian fjord that was its final resting place
YOU1000000136_S0000028	it looks like i don't know maybe one of the ships plates you can see some riveting here so there's still little scattered sort of mementos
YOU1000000136_S0000030	ah of tirpitz lying around here today of all these time
YOU1000000136_S0000032	patrick has come to norway to find out how the r a fs nine squadron and six one seven squadron the dam busters finally managed to sink the unsinkable battleship
YOU1000000136_S0000033	this day is ways commemorated as tirpitz day by six one seven squadron but it could be remembered in a very different fashion it could have been remembered as the day that six one seven squadron was annihilated
YOU1000000136_S0000034	it's an enduring mystery why was it that they were able to get in there bomb and get away with no losses it could have gone very very differently
YOU1000000136_S0000036	seventy years ago the tirpitz was the greatest single maritime threat to the allies
YOU1000000136_S0000038	at thirty-five miles an hour it was faster than any british battleship
YOU1000000136_S0000040	it's eight fifteen inch guns could fire seventeen miles beyond the horizon it could sink you before you even saw it
YOU1000000136_S0000042	its armor was so thick that conventional bombs bounced off it
YOU1000000136_S0000044	an impressive giant worship tirpitz was built to be as nearly unsinkable as a ship could be
YOU1000000136_S0000046	when hitler launched the tirpitz on april the first nineteen thirty-nine it was worldwide news teenager toni iverson was mesmerized by the flickering images
YOU1000000136_S0000048	i remember seeing in a cinema in new york where i lived and seeing a newsreel of this battleship this huge thing and i had no idea when i saw this with my girlfriend that said one day i might be linked the tirpitz
YOU1000000136_S0000050	toni was part of a generation who grew up with the romance of flying
YOU1000000136_S0000051	every young man in the world wanted to fly they didn't hurt sometimes on a saturday night when you'd come back to the local dance
YOU1000000136_S0000052	when you hope to go would say and what have you been doing today you could say well dicing with death in the heavens
YOU1000000136_S0000054	tony now ninety-four flew spitfires in the battle of britain he then joined the elite bomber force the dam busters
YOU1000000136_S0000056	in nineteen forty-three the dam busters six one seven squadron had breached the ruhr dams using inventor barnes wallis's bouncing bomb the squadron became the r a f's experts in precision bombing
YOU1000000136_S0000058	a year after the dams raid most of the squadron had moved on or had been killed in action it was time for the next generation of the best young flyers
YOU1000000136_S0000060	as the university and i decided that the air force really was for me i made the big mistake of saying that two and two made four i should have said five
YOU1000000136_S0000062	and because i said four i became a navigator and i was not very pleased at the time because i wanted to be a pilot
YOU1000000136_S0000063	i was a student and i was doing electrical engineering i didn't want to go into the army i didn't want to go into the navy and i thought the air force sounded pretty good but i was always a bit worried about my eyes because they
YOU1000000136_S0000064	it wasn't really as good as they should be so i just learnt the lies that they were the bottom line or whatever it was that they were being lost and reel that off and pass the eye test
YOU1000000136_S0000066	within months of joining the dam busters the new crews in their lancaster bombers would be fighting in one of the most inhospitable environments of the war
YOU1000000136_S0000068	after the german occupation of norway the arctic circle became one of the key battlegrounds of the conflict
YOU1000000136_S0000069	in january nineteen forty-two hitler ordered his biggest battleship north to threaten the arctic convoys delivering essential supplies to the russians
YOU1000000136_S0000071	churchill promised stalin that he would maintain this lifeline without it the soviet war effort would collapse
YOU1000000136_S0000073	in june nineteen forty-two the largest arctic convoy of the war thirty-five merchant ships set sail escorted by forty-four warships they were only too well aware that the tirpitz was poised to pounce
YOU1000000136_S0000075	the possibility that is going to to put to sea is enough to create what can i described i think is panic
YOU1000000136_S0000077	the rumor cause the admiralty to issue a fateful order
YOU1000000136_S0000079	the convoy is to scatter that means that the escort this massive escort they've gathered is to return home and that his merchant men ah are basically on their own this is an extraordinary decision
YOU1000000136_S0000080	and of those ships that set out only eleven actually make it to port they're sunk not by tirpitz but by german submarines and and the luftwaffe who have a field day so without firing a shot
YOU1000000136_S0000081	tirpitz had actually scored an enormous psychological victory against the allies
YOU1000000136_S0000083	this the biggest arctic convoys loss of the war provoked a furious response from winston churchill
YOU1000000136_S0000085	the destruction of this ship is the greatest event at sea at the present time no other target is comparable to it
YOU1000000136_S0000087	with royal navy ships desperately needed in the far east the british threw everything of the tirpitz including dive bombers manned torpedoes and midget submarines
YOU1000000136_S0000089	in two years thirty-one attempts failed to sink the phantom menace
YOU1000000136_S0000091	so churchill called in the dam busters to finally finish the job
YOU1000000136_S0000093	they would have just two months to sink the unsinkable tirpitz before the onset of the arctic winter
YOU1000000136_S0000095	if they failed the british navy in the north atlantic would be tied up until the spring
YOU1000000136_S0000097	the dam busters were to be joined by nine squadron one of the most distinguished in the r a f
YOU1000000136_S0000098	we were called to a special briefing up would hold sparked our friends base where um their wing commander flying man called tait
YOU1000000136_S0000099	took us into um a briefing room which have been totally blacked out so we knew there was something special
YOU1000000136_S0000101	and he was a fairly dramatic man and he enjoyed having us all sit down and then suddenly drawing the the cloth other model in front of him
YOU1000000136_S0000102	which was of course the tirpitz gasp everybody
YOU1000000136_S0000104	the beast was hiding at the northern tip of norway well out of the range of a direct attack from britain so the r a f came up with a daring plan
YOU1000000136_S0000106	we um were told to practise a lot of dinghy drill while dinghy drill was the procedure for getting out of an aeroplane if you had to land it in the sea
YOU1000000136_S0000108	they were going to attack the ship by the soviet union
YOU1000000136_S0000110	on september the eleventh the two squadrons took off on an unprecedented three thousand four hundred mile mission
YOU1000000136_S0000112	they first flew the eleven hundred miles to russia
YOU1000000136_S0000114	then after refueling and at the very limit of a lancaster's range they flew on to bomb the tirpitz
YOU1000000136_S0000116	in their bombay's they were carrying the new barns wallace designed twelve thousand pound tall boy
YOU1000000136_S0000118	it was a revolutionary precision weapon in the right hands it flew like a dart
YOU1000000136_S0000120	bonds wallace has designed it so it didn't tumble over like a bomb might it was dropped and flew directly onto the point it was aimed at i hope
YOU1000000136_S0000121	tallboy was beautifully designed if you could say that about a bomb it had fins at the rear so that when it fell it went into a spin that meant it was flying very accurately
YOU1000000136_S0000123	the raid would have such propaganda value that a film camera went along to record it
YOU1000000136_S0000125	after a six-hour flight from russia the lancaster's approached the target
YOU1000000136_S0000126	i could see tirpitz over the front of my lancaster and at about the same time i saw all the smoke generated start up and they had about two hundred plus so they filled with field
YOU1000000136_S0000127	very rapidly with with smoke just my bombers say that it's no good skip i can't see anything so we just we just had to go
YOU1000000136_S0000129	most of the tallboys plunged harmlessly into the smoke screen but having survived this attack the tirpitz was now forced to make a fatal move
YOU1000000136_S0000130	in nineteen forty-four despite five years of conflict the crew of the tirpitz was largely immune to the hardships of the war
YOU1000000136_S0000132	historian patrick bishop has come to tromso's tirpitz museum located in a former german bunker
YOU1000000136_S0000134	he's exploring the daily routine on board with curator life on the berg
YOU1000000136_S0000136	so this is like the your weekly tobacco regression yeah
YOU1000000136_S0000137	but under the coordinate
YOU1000000136_S0000138	what do we got
YOU1000000136_S0000139	something different
YOU1000000136_S0000140	ah my gosh i think we all know what that is don't we
YOU1000000136_S0000142	tobacco and condoms
YOU1000000136_S0000143	um huh
YOU1000000136_S0000144	two staples of the of the of the of the siemens equipment sure
YOU1000000136_S0000145	ah that is a cop for coffee from the ship taken out by some of the workers who was cutting the ship after the war
YOU1000000136_S0000146	yeah so but there is an ice bit of crockery that isn't it looks like they live pretty well
YOU1000000136_S0000148	the ship had a crew of two thousand four hundred men it was so large it ran its own bakery cinema and post office it even produced its own newspaper
YOU1000000136_S0000150	was twenty-one years old when he first stepped on board the forty-two thousand two hundred ton tirpitz
YOU1000000136_S0000152	we we we were young and we we were proud and and and the gods looked for our own nice blue uniform you understand
YOU1000000136_S0000154	german troops retreated on all fronts and starving german civilians faced daily attacks on their cities life on the tirpitz remained largely unaffected
YOU1000000136_S0000156	we have had good food and clean rooms clean wash three days into it we have meat
YOU1000000136_S0000157	and in the evening we have a a
YOU1000000136_S0000159	but in october nineteen forty-four as soviet forces advanced into norway the tirpitz was moved a hundred and twenty miles south to
YOU1000000136_S0000161	it was a fatal mistake the ship was now almost within range of a direct attack
YOU1000000136_S0000163	the news encouraged churchill to pile on the pressure
YOU1000000136_S0000165	i consider that every effort should be made to attack this ship even if losses have to be incurred
YOU1000000136_S0000167	the r a f went into a frenzy of activity if the lancaster bombers were completely stripped of excess weight and filled with extra fuel they might just reach their target
YOU1000000136_S0000169	our ranges were changed and armor was taking out the one behind the pilot's seat was taken out their big piece of armor plating they had to reduce the weight so they took out the mid-upper turret in its entirety
YOU1000000136_S0000170	they took the guns out of the front turret and reduce the amount of ammunition in the rear turret
YOU1000000136_S0000172	losing weight increased range but the lancaster's needed to carry much more one hundred octane aviation fuel to get them to tromso
YOU1000000136_S0000174	the extra fuel tanks was a wellington tank
YOU1000000136_S0000176	of ah two hundred gallons and a mosquito tank of fifty gallons one on top of the other placed inside the future large where the rest spade would have been
YOU1000000136_S0000177	and it was so dangerous that ground crew had to wear plimsolls because the danger of a spark they wore their boots and that was probably blow up the whole aircraft at least one perhaps several more around it as well
YOU1000000136_S0000178	i have to say that despite all the fuel giants big family tight and there's no sign of any leakage you still could smell that hundred octane
YOU1000000136_S0000179	ah so it it makes you feel a little bit sick i suppose
YOU1000000136_S0000181	on october the twenty-ninth nineteen forty-four the refitted lancaster's of six one seven and nine squadrons took off on a thirteen hour non-stop mission
YOU1000000136_S0000183	to succeed the undefended planes needed to take the tirpitz by surprise
YOU1000000136_S0000185	they cross the norwegian coast where they knew there was a gap in enemy radar and they used neutral sweden to disguise their approach
YOU1000000136_S0000187	everything was in place to finally send the tirpitz to the bottom of the sea
YOU1000000136_S0000189	but the one thing not in their control was the weather
YOU1000000136_S0000191	just thirty seconds before bombing commenced tirpitz was covered by a blanket of low cloud
YOU1000000136_S0000193	but most people didn't bomb because they couldn't see the tirpitz it very disappoint you all that preparation and all that hard work and all that flying
YOU1000000136_S0000194	and to arrive together at the right time over the right point and then to be wasted is i won't say disheartening because we were just hot we were annoyed by halves
YOU1000000136_S0000196	but after the failure of this raid there was to be no letter the crews were ordered back again
YOU1000000136_S0000198	there was no time to plan a new route and there was one more shock in store for them
YOU1000000136_S0000199	they said sorry to tell you chaps but since the last trip that we germans have moved two squadrons of fighters ah to be near the tirpitz
YOU1000000136_S0000201	in norway
YOU1000000136_S0000202	ah well this made us swallow a little bit
YOU1000000136_S0000203	we were a little apprehensive because of course we haven't got the military but
YOU1000000136_S0000205	but new evidence has emerged that suggests the dam busters and nine squadron were in even greater danger than they ever imagined
YOU1000000136_S0000207	in november nineteen forty-four the r a f was preparing to attack the battleship tirpitz for the third time in two months the british was still hoping to take the nazis by surprise even though they'd be flying the same route
YOU1000000136_S0000209	but new evidence suggests the germans may have been expecting them
YOU1000000136_S0000211	on the norwegian island of andorra historian patrick bishop is investigating a story that the germans repositioned some of their radar before the third raid
YOU1000000136_S0000213	patrick has come to the site of a vasa men radar installation the most powerful german radar of the conflict he's with local resident john ronald nauheim who was brought along a photograph his father took at the end of the war
YOU1000000136_S0000215	hitler had this obsession with the idea that there were the allies even though they were sure normandy landings have gone ahead he still clung to this belief that would be an allied landing in norway as well
YOU1000000136_S0000216	that's what i was
YOU1000000136_S0000217	i was told they though i was picking up all the ah the ship traffic going towards russia
YOU1000000136_S0000218	now if we look at the this picture here we've got this landmark which is it's very prominent
YOU1000000136_S0000219	ah rocky island just behind us and you can see with that in the bottom right hand corner of the picture um this box structure that's on the back of the scaffolding if you like is actually the rear of of of the radar set so that would mean that the
YOU1000000136_S0000220	that the thing is actually the vasa man is pointing inland it's not pointing out to sea where you might expect it to be
YOU1000000136_S0000221	yeah this is very interesting because it was possible for the vasa man radar to actually pick up the the raid as in claimant as it hold in on tromso to bomb the tirpitz
YOU1000000136_S0000223	with the radar repositioned to track the flyers coming from inland all it needed was one phone call to the fighter squadron that bardufoss
YOU1000000136_S0000225	in just thirteen minutes the fighters would be swarming around the tirpitz ready to shoot the lancaster's out of the sky
YOU1000000136_S0000227	one of those crack fighter pilots at bardufoss now lives halfway around the world in southern california
YOU1000000136_S0000229	curt schultz age ninety two meets with a group of veteran fliers every week
YOU1000000136_S0000231	seventy years ago he wouldn't have hesitated to shoot them down
YOU1000000136_S0000233	it's a friendship that has developed and i'm so grateful for that because i was the enemy
YOU1000000136_S0000235	kurt started the war as a navigator on bombing raids over england
YOU1000000136_S0000237	but later he became a fighter pilot he was posted to a squadron of fighter aces based deep inside the arctic circle he wasn't prepared for their relaxed attitude to discipline
YOU1000000136_S0000239	i arrived just a few days after they had tried to kill hitler and you know the the the salute was like that
YOU1000000136_S0000241	all of a sudden they all walked in and instead of greeting like that they greeting like that and you know i thought so but it was a very loose punch
YOU1000000136_S0000242	as far as real discipline was concerned but they were very very successful
YOU1000000136_S0000244	kurt flew sixty-three missions and had three confirmed kills some of his colleagues at bardufoss were among the highest scoring aces of the war
YOU1000000136_S0000246	he had one hundred ninety-nine victories and i think kept there was a group command i had maybe a hundred and sixty
YOU1000000136_S0000248	these three together had six hundred victories almost
YOU1000000136_S0000250	as the lancaster's took off in the early hours of november the twelfth from the frozen coastline of northern scotland the fighters at bardufoss were preying on their minds
YOU1000000136_S0000252	this would be their last chance to sink the tirpitz before the onset of the arctic winter
YOU1000000136_S0000254	it was cold but when you're twenty twenty-one june area you don't feel cold ascent but it was cold if we wanted to have a pee some kind waff
YOU1000000136_S0000255	in the mess at law see it provided milk bottles and of course they were little joke about those
YOU1000000136_S0000257	looking back they just pitched us into it as it were there's the target you've got the weapon gun go and do it um at the time we just got on until it them
YOU1000000136_S0000259	and that was our job
YOU1000000136_S0000260	it was a long long journey there was no ah radio contact of course any way we could navigate i couldn't ever get any how was take the odds shots of whichever star was previous
YOU1000000136_S0000261	and just keep my fingers crossed
YOU1000000136_S0000263	at seven a m the bombers turned east through what they still believed was a radar gap but german records show they had already been spotted
YOU1000000136_S0000264	defenseless laden with fuel and with two and a half tons of high explosives inside their tallboy bombs they were extremely vulnerable
YOU1000000136_S0000265	we had founder of flying into a a gym clear sky which which is perfect for our job absolutely but then one little thought came well it it pretty it'll suit the fighters pretty well too
YOU1000000136_S0000267	at seven forty the lancaster's began their run into the target from neutral sweden
YOU1000000136_S0000269	the tirpitz was already receiving information of confused sightings some placing bombers on a course to russia others placing them a hundred kilometers to the north
YOU1000000136_S0000271	no one alerted the bardufoss air base
YOU1000000136_S0000273	then at eight o nine the tirpitz on its own radar spotted the bomber force just thirty minutes away and it was coming straight at them
YOU1000000136_S0000275	the alarm finally sounded at the bardufoss fighter base at eight eighteen this was more than an hour after the raiders had first been spotted
YOU1000000136_S0000277	six minutes later the lancaster's passed a few miles to the east of bardufoss on their way north
YOU1000000136_S0000279	mine thought was help to christ the fighters don't get nearest if i got a one not one o nine up my backside and there would be a very little left i mean finished through this with his cannon
YOU1000000136_S0000281	at eight thirty curt schultz arrived at his messerschmitt one o nine fighter had he taken off then he could still have caught the lancaster's but kurt and his colleagues lost vital minutes getting off the ground
YOU1000000136_S0000283	for a start the planes were at the wrong end of the runway and then at the moment they were ready to take off air traffic control allowed a transport plane to land
YOU1000000136_S0000285	so tell that this u fifty-two that was coming fly in had led down the hill and so there was another five minutes lost
YOU1000000136_S0000289	just before eight thirty a m the lancaster's began their approach to the tirpitz r a f cameras were again on hand to film it all so far there was still no sign of kurt and his fighters
YOU1000000136_S0000291	it was sunday yes i was was standing on the deck then came the alarm
YOU1000000136_S0000292	and we saw the machine in south
YOU1000000136_S0000294	as the lancaster's approached they were confronted by the first of tirpitz as formidable weaponry the ship trained its massive fifteen inch guns onto the raiders each shell weighed more than a ton
YOU1000000136_S0000296	the tirpitz guns had a range of seventeen miles even the big heavy guns could be elevated to reach aircraft
YOU1000000136_S0000298	it was a great unfolding orange cloud this fifteen inch shell went off would have probably taken two lancaster's out of the sky together
YOU1000000136_S0000300	you could actually see these shells coming up they seem to come up so slowly it was a fascinating sight you never seen anything like it again
YOU1000000136_S0000302	within a minute the rest of tirpitz as defenses opened up on the advancing bombers
YOU1000000136_S0000304	my combat station was the anti-air gun
YOU1000000136_S0000305	you have to take a hat off to the german gunners they've got the altitude absolutely cocoon ah i mean we were fifteen thousand around the feet and the flak was are bursting exactly at that level
YOU1000000136_S0000306	but we were fortunate that they were a little bit early the the flak was in front of us by a matter of a few yards
YOU1000000136_S0000307	when the fuel in a two hundred gallon tank is used up and that's when it becomes dangerous because ah a bit of fly get through it's going to hit sort of a vaporized fuel
YOU1000000136_S0000308	how do you feel i must admit you you you're a bit excited and think fast i hope they don't hit us
YOU1000000136_S0000309	i had to get that airplane positioned so the bomb went down she hit this target which from fifteen thousand feet must have took to my bomb ever like a dinky toy even though it was nine hundred feet long
YOU1000000136_S0000311	the first tour boy was released at eight forty-one it's called a direct hit
YOU1000000136_S0000313	the next five record in another direct hit three near misses and astray
YOU1000000136_S0000315	yeah you could see it go down like a dart almost because it was painted bright green yeah you and death it looked quite nice actually diving down there
YOU1000000136_S0000316	it went through the speed of sound so what these poor sailors fit ah felt when two one two of them landed when the machine come are coming against you you have
YOU1000000136_S0000317	you cannot get air enough it's so as one pressed you you're you're air
YOU1000000136_S0000319	after the first wave of six bombers tony iverson was in the second wave of three he attacked at eight forty-two
YOU1000000136_S0000320	i bombed at number seven on number eight and i think i had a near miss or an awesome day miss i'm not sure i've never i can't go further than that
YOU1000000136_S0000322	this second wave scored two very near misses the bombs were beginning to overwhelm the ship
YOU1000000136_S0000324	the first bomb had landed midships it led to one of the magazines blowing up bomb four had hit close to a turret and blew it into the air bombs five seven nine and fourteen
YOU1000000136_S0000325	had landed close by these also had a devastating effect producing shock waves that buckled the ship's frame and caused it to start to capsize
YOU1000000136_S0000327	the first nine aircraft bombed in one and a half minutes that's ninety seconds you can count ninety seconds just think of nine five-ton bonds coming down at you
YOU1000000136_S0000329	nine squadron followed up dropping their tall boys into the smoke as they exploded few were certain of the outcome
YOU1000000136_S0000331	there was smoke up at the one aimed hospital since the points you'd think
YOU1000000136_S0000332	that the rear gunner was quite convinced bloody things going all the skip
YOU1000000136_S0000334	as the lancaster's turned away from the target they knew the danger wasn't over yet
YOU1000000136_S0000336	we realize we haven't seen any fighters which is
YOU1000000136_S0000338	amazing amazing luck
YOU1000000136_S0000340	they were luckier than they could have imagined the first german fighters were less than three minutes away as the last bomb was dropped
YOU1000000136_S0000342	it took me approximately ten minutes to get to tom's eve from bardufoss and when i arrived there the tirpitz was already turning over
YOU1000000136_S0000344	so i turn on a true back oh nothing i could do
YOU1000000136_S0000346	kurt had only just missed the defenseless lancaster's all the crews returned home safely was it luck or were there other forces at work
YOU1000000136_S0000348	the sinking of the battleship tirpitz after thirty-three failed attempts was a remarkable feat of navigation flying and precision bombing but it had a terrible human cost
YOU1000000136_S0000350	seventeen hundred sailors were on board as the ship began to capsize
YOU1000000136_S0000352	i i saw not the explosion from the hit on the ship but i feel the crick you have you you are feeling that the ship make a jump from a half metre
YOU1000000136_S0000353	and in the next moment the ship began to capsize it was so and so was it and and at last we hanging in the raining here
YOU1000000136_S0000354	and i go a moment later in terms of water yes and then i swim to the coastline and the water was oil and
YOU1000000136_S0000356	many of the
YOU1000000136_S0000358	they have have their face in the water they were tied and ah it it looked i see that it was crazy it it it looks as as when
YOU1000000136_S0000359	footballs was swimming in the water a crazy sight
YOU1000000136_S0000361	villa belt wilson was below decks when the ship capsized
YOU1000000136_S0000363	twenty-one-year-old karl heinz kiessling was lucky enough to be on shore at the time of the attack
YOU1000000136_S0000365	he rushed to the rescue of the hundreds of sailors trapped inside the hull
YOU1000000136_S0000367	as the tide rose the compartments began to fill with water the rescuers could hear their entombed comrades singing deutschland uber alles until the voices fell silent
YOU1000000136_S0000369	nine hundred and seventy-one sailors lost their lives but the beasts had been slain
YOU1000000136_S0000371	and then looking back it's quite remarkable that the raiders managed to get away with it ah when you think about it it's the defendants who've actually got the odds
YOU1000000136_S0000372	stacked in their favor you've got the squadron of a of crack fighters based nearby
YOU1000000136_S0000374	apparently with the specific job of looking after at the tirpitz you got the radar systems apparently pointing inwards yet there we are at the end of that morning the tirpitz is sunk
YOU1000000136_S0000375	and the attackers have got away with a virtually scott-free now maybe it was just sheer good luck but i've often thought that perhaps there's another explanation for what happened
YOU1000000136_S0000377	on the island of andorra patrick is following a new lead that might explain why the german fighters weren't scrambled in time
YOU1000000136_S0000379	he's meeting local resident journalist sander pettersen as a seventeen year old boy schoolboy sander worked in the indoor radar base for a german officer lieutenant carl heinrich vesna
YOU1000000136_S0000381	vesna was a key link in the radar communication network on the island patterson thinks vesna could have delayed vital information to the fighter squadron at bardufoss
YOU1000000136_S0000383	we understand that dressler had sympathy for england
YOU1000000136_S0000384	how how did he let you know that that he was in sympathy with germany's enemies
YOU1000000136_S0000385	you speak very good
YOU1000000136_S0000387	that's like a cigarette case or
YOU1000000136_S0000389	or inside then then
YOU1000000136_S0000391	vesna was in the right place at the right time but was he responsible for delaying vital information about the raid
YOU1000000136_S0000392	i think vesna has a finger to stop ah sending up germany ah ah plane to take the lancaster
YOU1000000136_S0000393	you you you may be right that that that vesna as you say had a hand in the affair
YOU1000000136_S0000395	to help support sender patterson's story patrick has been looking for more evidence he's uncovered a letter in the norwegian archives written by vesna just after the war
YOU1000000136_S0000397	this will he confirms this man's anti-nazi credentials no according to him he actually was actively working against his own people as early as nineteen forty-four
YOU1000000136_S0000398	it's not just him he's got at least three other colleagues who were in this conspiracy if you like with him the germans had a a sabotage plan which they've got to put in place if there was indeed an allied landing and they've got a quite an elaborate plan here for shooting their own offices
YOU1000000136_S0000399	and running up the white flag he goes over to the underground in norwegian ah resistance and they smuggle him out now if he his credentials weren't parker
YOU1000000136_S0000400	ah i can't imagine they would they would do that willingly so ah he does actually match up to the description that were given of him by sander
YOU1000000136_S0000402	so this new information opens the prospect of an intriguing new theory that a good german did intervene in a major operation of war on the side of the allies and had a material effect on the outcome
YOU1000000136_S0000404	on hearing the news that the beast had finally been slain churchill wrote to stalin r a f bombers have sunk the tirpitz let us rejoice together
YOU1000000136_S0000406	for the young airmen of nine and six one seven squadrons there was relief that they had finally finished the job
YOU1000000136_S0000408	we really didn't know we'd suck it until we got back to near base and they wadis they they sent out a signal to say he's had been destroyed
YOU1000000136_S0000409	yeah we feel feel marvelous really yeah i think it was called um churchill's beast wasn't it and i know we we said to ourselves well we've sunk the beast at last
YOU1000000136_S0000410	there's quite an interesting experience to to talk to you about something that happened very dearly seventy years ago and i'm just getting little flashes of memories
YOU1000000136_S0000411	i get to go a little flash of memory about the miss beer flowing freely wing commander in the middle of it drunk as a new
YOU1000000136_S0000412	and a great deal of laughter is shouting and chattering yes absolute celebration who've been three times for the damn thing we were beginning to think that it really was unsinkable
YOU1000000136_S0000415	frank tilley and basil fish celebrated their weekend leave with a trip to the london palladium to see comedian tommy trinder
YOU1000000136_S0000416	i remember tommy trinder making a joke about the tirpitz and so we sat there feeling quite pleased with their self a still alive
YOU1000000136_S0000418	seventy years ago kurt schultz nearly shot down toni iverson in the skies of northern norway today the former enemies are firm friends
YOU1000000136_S0000420	hello
YOU1000000136_S0000421	good morning tony
YOU1000000136_S0000422	hello
YOU1000000136_S0000423	i am so glad i can talk with you again just one week after your ninety-fourth birthday i like to church we got to know each other quite well and we have seen each other on my trips through california
YOU1000000136_S0000424	tony was not too enthused about meeting a damn german the pilot we were bit wary of each other ah for for quite a while ah but then
YOU1000000136_S0000425	when we had a drink and things loosen down
YOU1000000136_S0000426	it was a cool reception but we started talking and we became friends we never talked about the war we talked about all kinds of other things that were interesting to us
YOU1000000136_S0000427	talk with you again soon tony
YOU1000000136_S0000428	right
YOU1000000136_S0000429	goodbye
YOU1000000136_S0000430	goodbye
YOU1000000136_S0000432	he sounds not too strong
YOU1000000136_S0000434	this situation where we as human beings finally come through after the politicians did with us whatever they wanted to do and we think yes sir
YOU1000000136_S0000436	seventy years on the raid that finally sank the tirpitz is still considered one of the outstanding achievements of aerial warfare
YOU1000000136_S0000438	i think it was very well planned very well executed and ah to solve those big bombs in this closed circle around and on the ship
YOU1000000136_S0000439	was an accomplishment
YOU1000000136_S0000441	yeah
YOU1000000136_S0000443	but so thousand germans died so that's something we have to consider too
YOU1000000136_S0000445	crazy war
YOU1000000136_S0000447	for nothing
YOU1000000136_S0000449	eight years of my life
YOU1000000136_S0000451	it was pretty tough once but no it's all gone
YOU1000000136_S0000453	it's rather rather like the words at the ceremony of the cenotaph isn't it you know they shall not grow old it's a stick seeing the photo bit yeah
YOU1000000136_S0000454	after a cold war is dreadful i do really i mean if it came again we'd have to do the same again
YOU1000000136_S0000456	he couldn't have the nazis in charge could he no way
YOU1000000136_S0000458	no way

YOU1000000137_S0000277	it also changed how wealth was distributed and led to the rise of a new elite tycoons who became unimaginably rich
YOU1000000137_S0000279	families like the medici were merchants and bankers people who had been held in contempt by the feudal society of the middle ages now they were the ones in charge
YOU1000000137_S0000281	let's go back to the year fourteen twenty-five and the sculptor donatello
YOU1000000137_S0000283	his patron cosimo medici was the first great sponsor of the arts
YOU1000000137_S0000284	medici was a wealthy banker and a shrewd strategist who employed almost mafia like methods

YOU1000000137_S0000295	double-entry bookkeeping showed account holders how much capital they had on hand allowing them greater overview and control of their finances
YOU1000000137_S0000297	the medicis were global players they issued loans and signed secure credit notes with travelers that could be cashed in many countries the precursor to today's travelers checks
YOU1000000137_S0000302	on taxes donations to the needy on buildings and on art
YOU1000000137_S0000304	a host of writers scholars artists and architects were dependent on his money and they repaid him in beauty
YOU1000000137_S0000306	the medici palace is a glorious stage of renaissance art it's hard to believe that cosimo instructed the architect not to make it too magnificent as he didn't want to rouse the envy of the other patrician families
YOU1000000137_S0000308	the medicis also invested in this spiritual well-being they donated money for a new church the basilica di san lorenzo
YOU1000000137_S0000310	cosimo de medici supported artists careers and sponsored something that had not existed before the celebrity
YOU1000000137_S0000312	this celebrity arose in a sort of intellectual hothouse in a market full of competition where humanists intellectuals creatives and artists of all kinds were supported by the adults and very well paid by patrons
YOU1000000137_S0000314	these patrons in turn hoped these artists would bring their courts greater fame and status
YOU1000000137_S0000316	for painters and sculptors hyperbole soon became just as important as skill
YOU1000000137_S0000318	in this very competitive arena they acquired fame and status and we still know their names today
YOU1000000137_S0000320	but that also means the unrecognized artists the suffering genius was a particularly frequent phenomenon
YOU1000000137_S0000322	donatello was one of the first great celebrity artists of the renaissance
YOU1000000137_S0000324	he was almost sixty when it came to cosimo de medici with designs for his statue of david the boy who defeated goliath
YOU1000000137_S0000326	this his most significant work was also a brave one because donatello's david was naked
YOU1000000137_S0000328	just a few generations earlier ancient statues were destroyed for showing nudity
YOU1000000137_S0000330	both medici and donatello were certainly aware of how revolutionary it was
YOU1000000137_S0000331	donatello's david was the first life sized sculpture of a nude since antiquity
YOU1000000137_S0000333	unlike other cultures and the renaissance didn't worry about depicting naked or semi naked bodies that was very significant for the development of medicine
YOU1000000137_S0000335	you can't study anatomy if you can't depict a naked bodies
YOU1000000137_S0000337	that was crucial to a different way of looking at people
YOU1000000137_S0000339	a person wasn't just animated by the spirit and guided by the stars
YOU1000000137_S0000341	he was mechanically functioning machine and organism
YOU1000000137_S0000343	what was also unusual was its interpretation
YOU1000000137_S0000345	donatello's david is not a muscular adult but a youth with a rather feminine appearance
YOU1000000137_S0000347	and his fascinatingly lifelike but where donatello get his knowledge of the human body
YOU1000000137_S0000349	with the enthusiasm of the early renaissance for all things classical interest in anatomy was growing as well
YOU1000000137_S0000351	almost all the artists sculptors and painters of the renaissance would have studied human anatomy if only from books and drawings
YOU1000000137_S0000353	there was a flourishing trade in fresh corpses it was legal in many places and punishment for the crime was often draconian but curiosity often triumphed over fear
YOU1000000137_S0000355	donatello quite possibly dissected corpses too as did outplay durer michelangelo and leonardo da vinci one or two generations later
YOU1000000137_S0000357	but even in donatello's time in the early renaissance artists were very familiar with the structure of the human body which allowed them to create new very lifelike depictions of people

YOU1000000137_S0000365	half a century after donatello it symbolized the self-confidence of the new renaissance man
YOU1000000137_S0000369	the explosive thing about the renaissance was that people became aware of their abilities and strengths in a new way
YOU1000000137_S0000371	they unleashed an incredible energy in their thinking and actions in business and technology
YOU1000000137_S0000373	there was an outpouring of self-confidence
YOU1000000137_S0000375	in the middle ages nearly everyone was illiterate the few who could read and write were from wealthy families or men and women of the church
YOU1000000137_S0000377	the people who made or owned books looked after them like treasures
YOU1000000137_S0000379	a copyist might only produce ten to fifteen volumes and an entire lifetime which made the books incredibly valuable
YOU1000000137_S0000381	but that was about to change
YOU1000000137_S0000383	to obtain a lovely codex such as the bible for example you would have to slaughter an entire flock of sheep and that was expensive
YOU1000000137_S0000385	but suddenly books could be had for little money and reading became democratic
YOU1000000137_S0000387	knowledge became accessible to larger numbers of people
YOU1000000137_S0000389	more and more people were able to participate and scholarly discussions about new ideas
YOU1000000137_S0000391	that's the only way we can explain how europe became the continent of innovation more so than any other
YOU1000000137_S0000393	the scribes of the church hadn't just copy works they had also change them and falsified sources claiming their interpretation as the word of god
YOU1000000137_S0000395	that gave them great power
YOU1000000137_S0000397	but the renaissance broke their monopoly on knowledge one of the most important bastions of the church
YOU1000000137_S0000399	an awareness of sources in the truth grew not least because the sources were now accessible people started analyzing them using classical techniques techniques used in antiquity
YOU1000000137_S0000401	the traditional myths propagated by the church simply weren't accepted anymore
YOU1000000137_S0000403	mainz fourteen fifty printer johannes gutenberg's invention may have been the most significant one in a thousand years and yet we don't know what he looked like
YOU1000000137_S0000405	his achievement was to combine existing methods of reproduction and printing into a single system
YOU1000000137_S0000407	the handheld cast was the key to his printing press
YOU1000000137_S0000409	it allowed latest to be cast individually more quickly and with greater precision
YOU1000000137_S0000411	this marked the invention of modern printing
YOU1000000137_S0000413	it was also the dawn of mass communication
YOU1000000137_S0000415	information became more widely available opening the door to new opinions and perspectives
YOU1000000137_S0000417	information also became valued in new ways as the printed word to precedence over oral traditions
YOU1000000137_S0000419	printing was truly enormous significance and gutenberg is the person who did the most important thing in a thousand years of world history reading became increasingly widespread
YOU1000000137_S0000420	the great scientific innovations and the great religious revolution the reformation wouldn't have been possible without printing
YOU1000000137_S0000422	the first sixty years after the invention of printing for the publication of four hundred different vernacular editions of the bible
YOU1000000137_S0000424	at the same time the number of lay people who could read and write grew
YOU1000000137_S0000426	more and more people now have direct and immediate access to biblical texts to the word of god
YOU1000000137_S0000429	the people of the renaissance felt close to god they felt they were becoming godlike themselves they wouldn't have said that in the middle ages that would have been considered blasphemous people referred to the bible and called themselves god's creations
YOU1000000137_S0000430	god made us in his image were almost god's miniature god came closer to people in the renaissance than he ever was in the middle ages
YOU1000000137_S0000432	but it wasn't books that made up the bulk of the printing shop's business it was fly sheets and pamphlets
YOU1000000137_S0000434	they were affordable and cost labour to or three hours pay
YOU1000000137_S0000436	now even ordinary people could print a pamphlet and disseminate their opinions verses and drawings
YOU1000000137_S0000438	three subjects dominated sensations and miracles religious instruction and political and military propaganda
YOU1000000137_S0000440	illustrated fly sheets also carried the first caricatures
YOU1000000137_S0000442	they could be an invitation an opinion or a warning
YOU1000000137_S0000444	just like today's social media networks they served as a vehicle for the mass dissemination of opinions
YOU1000000137_S0000446	the renaissance had fly sheets it had literature that was printed and spread very quickly it could be printed in nurnberg tomorrows and in two days time would be in zurich
YOU1000000137_S0000448	information disseminated more quickly and was much harder to control too
YOU1000000137_S0000450	the censorship of the church that dictated what was right didn't work anymore once the fly sheets began circulating
YOU1000000137_S0000452	you can only understand the huge boom in freethinking in the renaissance if you look at the media and the fly sheets in particular
YOU1000000137_S0000454	mass communication helped create that new type of individual the celebrity
YOU1000000137_S0000456	giorgio vasari who had painted the frescos in the florence cathedral dome was also a biographer of the most dazzling personalities of his time the artists
YOU1000000137_S0000458	vasari also produced portraits of raphael and michelangelo but he was particularly taken with leonardo da vinci leonardo was unconventional and wasn't afraid to acknowledge his homosexuality
YOU1000000137_S0000460	he was remarkably creative and talented but also rather vain
YOU1000000137_S0000462	vasari was the first to coin the term rinascita renaissance
YOU1000000137_S0000464	he endowed his subjects with the aura that made them stars the shining lights of society
YOU1000000137_S0000466	he created an image of the artist that hadn't existed before
YOU1000000137_S0000468	most artists were craftsmen
YOU1000000137_S0000470	that's how they saw themselves and that tell other saw them but vasari created the image of the genius the strange crazy man the artist enthralled to ideas
YOU1000000137_S0000471	he painted a picture of an artist that seems strangely familiar today in fact he created the modern artist
YOU1000000137_S0000473	the painter holbein was the first to paint a portrait of his family
YOU1000000137_S0000475	star painters botticelli and diller even painted themselves the self-portrait became the expression of a new self-confidence
YOU1000000137_S0000477	and then finally raphael italian the first painter to sign their paintings a further step toward celebrity the great names in art suddenly became world famous a hundred years earlier it would have been unthinkable
YOU1000000137_S0000479	the towering figures of renaissance art first and foremost leonardo da vinci and michelangelo with fated invited to court and paint handsomely
YOU1000000137_S0000481	in thirteen hundred venetian glass blowers invented the convex mirror its importance is widely underestimated but compared with what had come before its reflection was bright and almost free of distortion
YOU1000000137_S0000483	most people in the middle ages had only seen their faces as blurry reflections in water
YOU1000000137_S0000485	the glass mirror meant people could really see themselves clearly for the first time
YOU1000000137_S0000487	maybe that's why they were more self-confident than their medieval ancestors
YOU1000000137_S0000489	self-confidence and pride in personal achievements were no longer seen as sinful
YOU1000000137_S0000491	humidity was out of step with the times
YOU1000000137_S0000493	a person who held his head high and walk tall in the presence of god who saw reason as a special gift from god those with the new values
YOU1000000137_S0000495	as a result of humility became less important as humans we're capable and god wants us to use our gifts in the world
YOU1000000137_S0000497	what was the secret of the great renaissance artists this immense flourishing of creativity remains a mystery but their charisma endures to this day
YOU1000000138_S0000001	last year was the deadliest year on record for mexico
YOU1000000138_S0000003	drug related violence has infiltrated all parts of society and all parts of the country affecting everyone and it is absolutely everywhere
YOU1000000138_S0000005	acapulco was somewhere at the center of some of the worst violence in the country
YOU1000000138_S0000007	our story was the influence of the crime gangs have their their tentacles have spread out across the country acapulco is a good example of it so we asked the police if we can go along on a police patrol
YOU1000000138_S0000009	well the c i a's latest travel advisory for a number of areas in mexico but particularly here is don't even bother going if you are a tourist visa for that they say is that the murder rate danger levels so high that actually comparable to iraq
YOU1000000138_S0000010	and syria indeed here in one month last year over two thousand people were murdered in the drag world
YOU1000000138_S0000012	on this patrol we arrived at a village or small town and it was a
YOU1000000138_S0000014	bizarre experience
YOU1000000138_S0000016	we came across a crime scene where less than twenty four hours previously eight people had been killed
YOU1000000138_S0000018	okay so this is ah
YOU1000000138_S0000020	so this is where somebody has been killed right
YOU1000000138_S0000022	so one person here
YOU1000000138_S0000024	another one here
YOU1000000138_S0000026	there was still a bullet holes everywhere with blood splattered on the floor another has another that loser would easily to flowers and candles that had been left on the spots where people had died only just recently
YOU1000000138_S0000027	the last of the crime scene is here and you can see ah the bullet holes from the shooting took place about eight in total so it's pretty big and organized hit
YOU1000000138_S0000029	they actually went from person to person i mean these were actual shooting individuals to not just this but actually went so that they were hiding
YOU1000000138_S0000031	you sure it was pretty shocking to see their families their wives their moms their sisters really traumatizing it was very very sad
YOU1000000138_S0000033	there was a lot of grief and that people were upset by what they've seen and they wanted justice
YOU1000000138_S0000035	they said this is not my first time this is my second this is my first kid they killed all my family in junetta this had a conflicts on it's really bad you feel
YOU1000000138_S0000037	i feel really really sad when we when we when we left
YOU1000000138_S0000039	it's a level of brutality and tragedy that is very very difficult to get your head drowned when you come from a a society like i live in
YOU1000000138_S0000041	something like that happened in surrey on hackney or it's going to be in the newspapers all over the u k and here is just
YOU1000000138_S0000043	something little next day i won't remember
YOU1000000138_S0000045	you had decided to try and get to actually the people who make the stuff that fuels are all of the problems
YOU1000000138_S0000047	we were taken up into the mountains to a modest house with a big front porch and now we are introduced to a guy who is clearly in charge he said farmers union or is open to interpretation
YOU1000000138_S0000049	we aren't just arrive this has been worked on for long periods of time but contact have to be made
YOU1000000138_S0000051	they don't know who you are they might think that your undercover american drug enforcement
YOU1000000138_S0000053	oh just put in ourselves in are really stupid situation where they can kill us
YOU1000000138_S0000055	these guys don't see themselves as gangsters they actually just seeing themselves as businessmen and farmers
YOU1000000138_S0000057	the gun shot wouldn't admit to farming oakland but he did say he farmed what he farmed to survive
YOU1000000138_S0000059	one of the first tales he told us when we start talking to him was about how he had been arrested but this wasn't an ordinary arrests three blackhawk helicopters turned up this doesn't happen for just anybody
YOU1000000138_S0000063	they may look very normal but they are involved in a very very dangerous business in many way they were a bit like the mexican sopranos if you like
YOU1000000138_S0000065	he was very affable but there is no forgetting that this is a serious character and though this is essentially an interview but we were the ones being interviewed
YOU1000000138_S0000067	i've been having lunch with many of these farmers and they are just really lovely and nice people if they had to kill you they kill you but ah you know they are good friends to each other
YOU1000000138_S0000069	he made phone call to be allowed to go up into the jungle where we met by security guys carrying machine guns fully kitted out with their faces with bandanas
YOU1000000138_S0000071	they took us to the public field
YOU1000000138_S0000073	after about half an hour of really rough terrain
YOU1000000138_S0000075	we arrived into this opening it looked like the middle of the forest had just been completely opened up so that they could grow the poppies
YOU1000000138_S0000077	so this is the poppy oil that becomes opium and eventually that becomes
YOU1000000138_S0000079	yeah and all these field having these
YOU1000000138_S0000081	weather's perfect for it and it just keeps producing so it's brilliant crop and why wouldn't the demand is so high and as long as the demand is high and we know the biggest user is the united states than its going to keep being made
YOU1000000138_S0000083	they know what happen when you ask him you know that with this they create
YOU1000000138_S0000085	yes and you know that that create lots of problems
YOU1000000138_S0000086	yes but
YOU1000000138_S0000088	if they demand us avocado we grew avocado
YOU1000000138_S0000089	it seem interesting that what happens here and what happens in acapulco they're linked but nobody thinks about right
YOU1000000138_S0000090	this is what we have to do we have no other option
YOU1000000138_S0000092	i remember one farmer tell me yeah i know that is poisoned but if i don't create these poison my family is going to die
YOU1000000138_S0000094	speaking to them it was pretty clear that they considered there was a real threat from rival gangs coming into take their crops
YOU1000000138_S0000095	if we don't have a gun to protect us they will kill us
YOU1000000138_S0000097	nobody really knows how much money is made by the drug cocktails but this is billions and billions and billions and billions ah of dollars
YOU1000000138_S0000099	and its nationwide it's absolutely every city every town every village in varying levels
YOU1000000138_S0000101	a wider involvement in the drugs or involvement in crime it is actually perpetuated by this whole society where criminality is completely normal
YOU1000000138_S0000103	we went to meet a guy who is a hit man
YOU1000000138_S0000105	he explains to us in in detail the hits that he carrying now
YOU1000000138_S0000107	you have business rivals now not cartels hiring this guy to take out rivals
YOU1000000138_S0000109	if i need to fix something in my business and i think that my partner is stealing part of my money i just call this guy
YOU1000000138_S0000111	the businessman he's working for a business women as he was keen to point out will actually ask for really horrible things ham's co heads cut
YOU1000000138_S0000112	it's a completely different level of the scale violence
YOU1000000138_S0000114	he interested so absolutely no reason to feel any type of remorse and although he's quite pleasant he's pleasant to us he's very very dangerous individual
YOU1000000138_S0000116	violence throughout their societies become the norm
YOU1000000138_S0000118	it really is a mess and everybody we speak to doesn't see an end to in fact they see it getting worse
YOU1000000138_S0000120	the problem is so big and so ingrained is it actually
YOU1000000138_S0000122	possible to saw what after it's become part of of society
YOU1000000138_S0000124	the crime levels and the sheer amount of money that's available from crime is guarantee that mexico's gonna suffer for a very very long time
YOU1000000139_S0000001	i'm garry kasparov and the like to share with you some of my most memorable moments at the chessboard
YOU1000000139_S0000003	it's game twenty-four against anatoly karpov the world championship match nineteen eighty-seven in seville spain i was trailing
YOU1000000139_S0000005	twelve to eleven before the last game and as a world champion i had my last chance to retain the title by beating karpov in this game four who forgave twenty-four i was not rushing from the beginning i tried to play a very quiet positional game
YOU1000000139_S0000006	waiting for carbs mistakes and the game was adjourned to be resumed next day
YOU1000000139_S0000008	and the position that you could see now it's hard to assess i still don't know what it's winning for white or its draw i would say it's fifty fifty white has an extra pawn as you could see but they're all pawns on the same side
YOU1000000139_S0000009	a limited number of pieces so it's very difficult to actually find any winning plan for white
YOU1000000139_S0000011	next day when i showed up at this stage i was a couple of minutes earlier i have to say that with my coaches we have been analyzing this but we couldn't find any decisive ideas and then i saw karpov entering the stage
YOU1000000139_S0000013	that was the crucial moment because i could look at his eyes i could look at his body and he looked doomed
YOU1000000139_S0000015	i could immediately understand that he didn't believe he could defend this position and that's everything it's about your confidence that you can either win or defend and that will makes all the difference for the outcome of the game
YOU1000000139_S0000016	so karpov played g six and i was waiting just playing some unimportant moves queen c five queen f seven even if these moves are unimportant it adds chances that he will make a mistake and after h four karpov made a decisive mistake
YOU1000000139_S0000018	just amazing because after the adjournment he had time to analyze this position home and and this move it fixes the pawn structure but the problem is now white can exchange queens and because these pawns are fixed is two weaknesses black position will be lost
YOU1000000139_S0000019	and eventually i proved my position by threatening to change queens and pushed pushed and pushed and eventually won the game
YOU1000000139_S0000021	so ah that's one of the clearest moments where he could see the translation of your psychological weakness into serious mistakes at the chessboard
YOU1000000139_S0000023	it is another memorable moment very painful one i have to admit nineteen ninety-six the final match for a grand pre-event rapid blitz chess that i played against vishy anand
YOU1000000139_S0000025	i think i have emphasized as a buoys game so it's a five minutes chess it's not about making long-term calculations this moves played by instincts
YOU1000000139_S0000027	we probably blitz games the first one i was almost losing but managed to escape and that's the last decisive game i played was black totally outplayed him as you could look at the position black has two pawns with me and precise two extra pawns
YOU1000000139_S0000029	and total domination in the center so i don't know which move is not winning you know if you don't make a move you're still winning but i wanted just to exchange wins and of course you can take with a knight here and then after exchange of queens it's an endgame with two extra pawns
YOU1000000139_S0000030	i think that most likely anand have resigned if i just take with a knight on this three but suddenly i thought you know white took the knight if i don't get me the same by exchanging queens by taking who's queen
YOU1000000139_S0000031	the problem is that white does not have there is not forced to take a queen all of a sudden has a move queen takes d four and instead of having winning position black now is lost because my queen is attacked
YOU1000000139_S0000032	my rook is attacked my bishop is attacked and there's nothing i can do about it
YOU1000000139_S0000034	so that's one of the more blunders i mean i couldn't see my face i could imagine this one the hundreds of hundreds of images showing my color frustration
YOU1000000139_S0000036	annad sam it cost me the victory the final but also it's kind of a a memory score so it's just it's something that is just it's it's ah sitting there so um
YOU1000000139_S0000037	even about twenty years later i cannot look at this position without some sort of pain
YOU1000000139_S0000039	another very memorable and very painful moment
YOU1000000139_S0000041	it's a last game of my ah famous rematch against deep blue in nineteen ninety-seven because i won the first one nineteen ninety-six the match was a tie each side one one game with three draws played with black pieces
YOU1000000139_S0000042	and i missed my chances game four and five and i i wasn't sure when i started the game and i picked up the line that i never played before
YOU1000000139_S0000043	but that was my hope that since i never played it before and it was not part of my opening repair to our that computer would not be ready
YOU1000000139_S0000045	and i play in this position very risky to be precise bad move h six attacking the knife and provoking white to sacrifice a piece which is very strong it's maybe not winning but gives white a very strong initiative
YOU1000000139_S0000046	but machines don't sacrifice the piece for a pawn without having a concrete outcome inside
YOU1000000139_S0000048	so i expected that computer would go back on e four because this move was not in the special database prepared by grand master team that worked with deep blue
YOU1000000139_S0000049	and to my horror the blue immediately took one and six which meant that the move was already put in
YOU1000000139_S0000051	i just couldn't play this game position was pretty dangerous and bad but you know i lost it in a few moves because i was shocked by the fact that i just made such miscalculation
YOU1000000139_S0000053	i found out later too many years later that i was right on both counts one is that machines didn't play such moves it was just against machines logic and that was admitted by the deep blue team
YOU1000000139_S0000054	saying deep blue would have never made this move unless that very morning they decided to install this opening position in the opening book maybe it's the most famous game in the history of chess if you look at the sheer numbers who followed it
YOU1000000139_S0000055	many people believed it was a watershed moment where machines ah established its dominance over human players now of course the features app on your mobile phone today is stronger than deep blue
YOU1000000139_S0000057	this is arguably most important game in my life game twenty four against anatoly karpov me now second match nineteen eighty-five
YOU1000000139_S0000059	i was leading twelve to eleven before the last game and karpov had to win to ah retain his title
YOU1000000139_S0000061	and as you could see he achieved very promising position it's a white concentration on the kingside its menacing and white has quite a few options one is just it's i should always watch a five as the as a breakthrough
YOU1000000139_S0000062	another one is a little more subtle to play a bishop d four just exchanging the bishop that is one of the key defenders of blacks king kind of like goes e five then he takes now because of the attack on f seven i have to take was a knight
YOU1000000139_S0000064	but then queen actually changes its direction attacking h seven point
YOU1000000139_S0000066	so there are many options for white and it seems that black had nothing to do to improve his position
YOU1000000139_S0000068	here after long thought i found one of the most difficult moves in my life and at first sight is a paradox because you don't want to put your rook in such an ugly position as e seven
YOU1000000139_S0000069	but that's something that you have to do instead of whitener pushing on the kingside the game shifted to the center and a queenside and priority here is to defend the king rook here protects this pawn and neutralizes boughs of white threads
YOU1000000139_S0000070	and that's most important because if white initiative doesn't produce immediate results then eventually black can do something active
YOU1000000139_S0000072	and i remember that's when i play rook e seven and carpet came back to the chessboard from his ring room instantly you could feel that he sends that something has changed he didn't like it so i actually began gaining even more confidence
YOU1000000139_S0000074	your confidence is not only good for you but somehow it transcends to your opponent and it undermines your opponent's confidence
YOU1000000139_S0000076	and the karpov made a quite move king g one i put another rook here which is totally odd because both rooks are just standing behind pawn all these things but i'm just fighting his f five and then after the b one i even play f five
YOU1000000139_S0000077	and karpov took a pawn some i took on f six and then eventually i scarifies the pawn
YOU1000000139_S0000079	game ended up with a complicated position that's karpov had to force a draw but he decided to press forward because draw didn't make any good to him and eventually i won the game won the match and won my title november nine nineteen eighty-five
YOU1000000139_S0000081	you have to make tough decisions and you have to be able to resist pressure and survive after psychological blows and losses it's more visual character and with some good training it's not really hard to reach certain level
YOU1000000139_S0000082	the difficulty starts when you are trying to fight for big titles and just to climb to the top
YOU1000000140_S0000000	this parenting is hard mate you need patience that i have a lot of patience to deal with these kids i'm not gonna lie i don't have a lot of patients i'm learning i'm trying certain things that make me mad like i don't i don't like it when i tell my kids to do stuff and they do exactly what i say

YOU1000000143_S0000003	who is actually my mother's maiden name
YOU1000000143_S0000005	and the answer to my credit card security question

YOU1000000143_S0000009	i grew up in china who didn't
YOU1000000143_S0000011	and my childhood memories are totally ruined by my childhood
YOU1000000143_S0000013	when i was in elementary school as part of the curriculum i had to work in a rice paddy right next to a quarry where they used explosives to break rocks
YOU1000000143_S0000015	and that is where i learned that a light travels faster than sound
YOU1000000143_S0000017	which is almost as slow as a flying rock
YOU1000000143_S0000019	my dad was a grumpy guy but occasionally he would try to cheer me up with jokes but he doesn't do it right when i was seven one day he said to me hey son why is tofu
YOU1000000143_S0000020	better than centralized socialist economy
YOU1000000143_S0000022	so five minutes later i said why
YOU1000000143_S0000024	he said because i said so
YOU1000000143_S0000026	i came to the united states in when i was twenty-four ah to study at rice university in texas
YOU1000000143_S0000028	that wasn't a joke

YOU1000000143_S0000039	and he would say to me hey dad why do i have to learn two languages i said sun once you become the president of the united states you are going to have to sign legislative bills in english
YOU1000000143_S0000040	and talk to debt collectors in chinese
YOU1000000143_S0000042	when i graduated from rice i decided to stay in the united states because in china i can't do that thing the thing i do best here being ethnic
YOU1000000143_S0000044	and in order for me to become a u s citizen i had to take ah american history lessons where they asked us questions like who is benjamin franklin we are like ah

YOU1000000143_S0000054	later on
YOU1000000143_S0000056	i read so much about american history that i started to harbor white goat
YOU1000000143_S0000058	and in america they say all men are created equal but after birth it kind of depends on the parents income or education or health care
YOU1000000143_S0000060	i read in men's health magazine that president obama every week has ah two cardio days and four weightlifting days
YOU1000000143_S0000062	you see i don't have to exercise because i have health insurance
YOU1000000143_S0000064	i live in massachusetts now where we have universal health care then we elected scott brown
YOU1000000143_S0000066	talk about mixed messages

YOU1000000143_S0000076	so ah i to be honest i was honored to be here tonight and i have prepared for months ah for tonight show and i showed the white house by jokes about president obama and that is when he decided not to come
YOU1000000143_S0000078	and he started to talk about immigration reforms
YOU1000000143_S0000080	take that stephen colbert
YOU1000000143_S0000082	and president obama has always been accused of being too soft but he was conducting two wars and they can still gave him the nobel peace prize
YOU1000000143_S0000084	and he accepted it
YOU1000000143_S0000086	you can't be more badass than that
YOU1000000143_S0000088	well actually i am thinking the only way you can be more badass than that is if you take the nobel peace prize money and give it to the military
YOU1000000143_S0000090	we have many distinguished journalist is here tonight journalist here tonight who i consider as matt piers
YOU1000000143_S0000092	because i used to write for our campus newspaper
YOU1000000143_S0000094	i think journalism is the last refuge for puns
YOU1000000143_S0000096	only in the newspaper can you say things like i was born in the year of the horse
YOU1000000143_S0000097	and that is why i am in this year
YOU1000000143_S0000099	my point exactly
YOU1000000143_S0000101	and ah tonight is my first time at cspan which is a channel i obviously always watch
YOU1000000143_S0000103	when i couldn't stand the ah sensationalism and demagoguery of p b s and q v c
YOU1000000143_S0000105	if i can still fall asleep after watching cspan
YOU1000000143_S0000107	there is cspan two and cspan three
YOU1000000143_S0000109	so i became a u s citizen in two thousand eight um which i am really happy about thank you very much ah
YOU1000000143_S0000111	america is number one
YOU1000000143_S0000113	that's true cause we won the world series every year
YOU1000000143_S0000115	after becoming a u s citizen and ah i immediately registered to vote for obama and biden
YOU1000000143_S0000117	you are welcome
YOU1000000143_S0000119	you had me at yes we can
YOU1000000143_S0000121	that was their slogan
YOU1000000143_S0000123	so after getting obama and biden elected i felt this power trip
YOU1000000143_S0000125	and i started to think maybe i should run for president myself well i have to take a step back and explain a little bit because ah
YOU1000000143_S0000127	i had always been a moratorium pessimistic guy
YOU1000000143_S0000129	i felt that ah life is kind of like peeing into the snow on a dark winter night
YOU1000000143_S0000131	you probably made a difference but it is really hard to tell
YOU1000000143_S0000133	but now we have a president who is half black half white it just gives me a lot of hope because i am half not black in half not white
YOU1000000143_S0000135	two negatives make a positive
YOU1000000143_S0000137	ah you may be saying hey what would be your campaign slogan you see i spent ten years in the past decade
YOU1000000143_S0000139	oh you're two okay
YOU1000000143_S0000141	so i understand that the american people are suffering so my campaign slogan will be who cares
YOU1000000143_S0000143	if elected i will make same sex marriage not only legal but required
YOU1000000143_S0000145	that will get me the
YOU1000000143_S0000147	you see i am married now but i used to be really scared about marriage i was like wow fifty percent of all marriages end up lasting forever
YOU1000000143_S0000149	and i will eliminate unemployment in this country by reducing the productivity of the american workforce
YOU1000000143_S0000151	so two people will have to do the work of one
YOU1000000143_S0000153	just like the president and the vice president
YOU1000000143_S0000155	or the olsen twins
YOU1000000143_S0000157	and despite our disease of cancer most americans die of natural causes so if elected i will find a cure for natural causes
YOU1000000143_S0000159	you seemed to like that one
YOU1000000143_S0000161	but you won't be covered by health insurance though
YOU1000000143_S0000163	because of ah preexisting conditions
YOU1000000143_S0000165	and i have a quick solution for global warming i will switch from fahrenheit to celsius
YOU1000000143_S0000167	it was one hundred degrees not forty
YOU1000000143_S0000169	you are very welcome you are very welcome
YOU1000000143_S0000171	and ah i agree with foreign policy because i am from china and i can see russia from my backyard
YOU1000000143_S0000173	i believe that unilateralism is too expensive and open dialogue is too slow so if elected i will go with text messaging
YOU1000000143_S0000175	i will text our allies just to say hi
YOU1000000143_S0000177	and text our enemies when they are driving
YOU1000000143_S0000179	o m g you are building a nuclear weapon

YOU1000000147_S0000050	the extortionate price tag is thanks to the technique walmart developed in the nineteen ninety's to treat the meat
YOU1000000147_S0000051	the cattle are hand reared and free to roam the forests and grasslands of the french countryside and only four killed weekly
YOU1000000147_S0000052	each cow is then slaughtered due mainly to make the process as stress free as possible and keep the city levels at a minimum

YOU1000000147_S0000059	why you ask firstly they are almost exclusively grown on the tiny island of none motor off the coast of western france and only about twenty tons are produced yearly
YOU1000000147_S0000060	preparing them for sale is also an arduous process because they're too delicate to be machine harvested
YOU1000000147_S0000061	so each potato must be carefully hand picked in step with all the added effort it takes to get a hold of them it might be wondering why allow but not potatoes are worth eating to begin with
YOU1000000147_S0000062	fans of the souped up spuds say the sea air and seawater which acts as a fertilizer for the soil gives the potatoes a hint of seesaw and even a suggestion of limit

YOU1000000147_S0000068	in the forest of piedmont and northern italy where they grow inches below the earth with the roots of hardwood trees which means finding them isn't easy
YOU1000000147_S0000069	specially trained dogs or pigs known as tropical tours must scour the forest floor in search of hidden gems below the earth
YOU1000000147_S0000070	scientists have tried and failed to domesticate wild truffles meaning you also won't be stumbling upon any in your local supermarket anytime soon
YOU1000000147_S0000071	these factors all contribute to the fervor surrounding truffles and the value their complex flavor can bring to risotto pasta and even for a gra just one pound of white truffles cost around two thousand dollars

YOU1000000147_S0000078	after brewing coffee from the discarded beans they realized it tasted great too mostly because these civets picked only the ripe cherries
YOU1000000147_S0000079	the tradition continued in nowadays vendors of authentic kopi luwak coffee can command anywhere between two hundred and fifty dollars to one thousand two hundred per kilogram
YOU1000000147_S0000080	there are some controversies surrounding the unconventional beverage though primarily civet cats are nocturnal and don't have big appetites
YOU1000000147_S0000081	which means more than eighty percent of cocoa or coffee sold in the u s has never actually passed through one
YOU1000000147_S0000082	attempts to industrialize the process also means many civet cats are caged and force fed the berries round the clock which results in crappy coffee made by very crappy people

YOU1000000147_S0000105	a cheese course is the perfect way to complete a meal for a banquet like this one plain old cheddar just won't cut it
YOU1000000147_S0000106	believe it or not there is such a thing as donkey cheese otherwise known as pure and it'll cost you a pretty penny
YOU1000000147_S0000107	this bizarre creation is only produced by farmers slobodan simic on his rural farm in serbia with the help of some three hundred donkeys from zasavica nature reserve
YOU1000000147_S0000108	it's esteemed for its supposed health benefits with claims that its high in protein calcium and omega three fatty acids
YOU1000000147_S0000109	getting milk from the donkey isn't easy because only about twenty animals produce it at one time
YOU1000000147_S0000110	and it takes several gallons of milk to make one pound of cheese
YOU1000000147_S0000111	this is because the milk doesn't contain enough casing the characteristic that thickens it in occurred to make the cheese the traditional way
YOU1000000147_S0000112	thankfully someone came a secret method to make the cheese but it comes at a price
YOU1000000147_S0000113	each kilo sells about one thousand and one hundred and ten dollars that's a lot to pay for literal ass cheese
YOU1000000147_S0000114	don't you think which of these premium ingredients would you most like to try let me know in the comments and thanks for watching
YOU1000000148_S0000000	hi vogue this is carla bruni and today i will be looking through my life in looks
YOU1000000148_S0000002	all right this must have been one of the first show i did for chanel and i've been working with karl are basically until he left us last year and the funny thing about karl is that he was always so late
YOU1000000148_S0000003	that somehow i'm actually wondering if his really passed away or maybe he's just late and he might arrived
YOU1000000148_S0000004	fashion was always going back to sources that would be a few decades earlier the hair and the makeup and also the look of the outfit still from the eighties i would say
YOU1000000148_S0000006	ah voila here is johnny versace naomi campbell and myself i am wearing a catsuit a very sort of splendid gorgeous a printed catsuit and naomi's wearing i guess
YOU1000000148_S0000007	the same type of print that i'm wearing but she is wearing a dress versace's style was ah extremely audacious you know
YOU1000000148_S0000008	it was not about being classic it was about being strong sexy and even a little transgressive
YOU1000000148_S0000009	this picture almost makes me sad thinking that johnny's gone is still a shock he was like a sort of you know lovely father to us
YOU1000000148_S0000011	oh my god here i am as a bride at givenchy
YOU1000000148_S0000013	it's pleasure always to be the bride in a show i don't know they still do that
YOU1000000148_S0000014	but at the time it was a pleasure because it was like the clothes you know the sort of the cherry on the cake and then you know everyone wants to be dressed as a bride once in a while i would look like an easter egg if i was wearing this now you know
YOU1000000148_S0000015	but now it's too late but at the time it was so fresh and romantic right uber de givenchy was such an incredible designer but also such a gentleman to such a pleasure to be one of the girls you know
YOU1000000148_S0000016	next look mm-hmm so here is me with miuccia prada obviously out of fitting i always loved her brand i like what she does the like which creates
YOU1000000148_S0000017	she's a very delicate laid-back person and when i was modeling we were doing hours of fittings for each designer you get to see the clothes very early
YOU1000000148_S0000018	and you see how much work there is to make something you know happened and to make something become a dress or suit or a coat
YOU1000000148_S0000019	i like this picture and others there's a rays of sun both miuccia and me are very young nice
YOU1000000148_S0000021	well this is versace again this versace couture just after the show at the hotel room i think there was a dinner after the show i remember the dress
YOU1000000148_S0000022	but we used to do maybe twenty shows per season and per country so at the end of it four times a year there was no medium shows but there was couture shows also my god
YOU1000000148_S0000023	a lot of walk fashion week was was crazy it was eclectic we would run all the time sleep very little eat very little i was running in a car from a show to another
YOU1000000148_S0000024	you know there was so much fun hah that so much work this is nineteen eighty-six promoting kodak shooting in london and dress actually has something particular you know has pictures are over of myself
YOU1000000148_S0000025	isn't this embarrassing would you wear a dress with pictures of your cell phone and this is so funny really i want to wear these dresses and maybe we can get it back
YOU1000000148_S0000026	not ready to wear it but just to have it also makes me think that we used to work argentique you couldn't retouch it very easily so you had to do a very good light everything was about the hair and makeup and the light
YOU1000000148_S0000027	and so we couldn't go back in a computer and fix it picture was what it was and that was the nice part about it because the creative process was always going towards as much perfection as we could
YOU1000000148_S0000028	because then that was it we couldn't do much and are retouches were very hard to do okay so this is not to look ha it's a t-shirt
YOU1000000148_S0000030	this is the column of my first album i was actually wearing yes a t-shirt and jeans i would say but of course these pictures are from kate barry very talented french photographer
YOU1000000148_S0000031	this picture is about simplicity there's almost no makeup no hair and laying down with my guitar there's something very pure and simple about the picture right
YOU1000000148_S0000032	i made this picture for my album as far as i could from sophisticated world because i wanted to give another message which was this is all gonna be about the music
YOU1000000148_S0000033	you know has such a strong image coming from modeling that i had to try to cut it off you know and to show something of myself that had nothing to do with makeup and with being glamorous
YOU1000000148_S0000034	you know this is not a glamorous picture but i think he helped the album to make people understand that ah was a songwriter and not a model anymore
YOU1000000148_S0000037	this is the winter olympic games two thousand six in turin you know which is the city i was born i was so honored when they asked me to hold the flag
YOU1000000148_S0000038	and i'm wearing a dress designed by armani and i had to cross the whole stadium it was freezing cold and this is a dress entirely made of glass and metal you know
YOU1000000148_S0000039	so it's like a sort of material that the knight would wear in the middle age you know what i mean the sort of them it's all made of metal into something very metal it was very heavy
YOU1000000148_S0000040	and under this dress i was wearing like um pants and shirts huh because it was so cold it was the winter olympic games and it was outside but so cold
YOU1000000148_S0000041	so i was actually happy to wear such a heavy dress and to be able to wear proper wool you know mountain underwear ha ha ha
YOU1000000148_S0000043	all right so this is michelle obama and myself i think we're in strasburg she's one of the nicest person i've met you knowing in that time in that world which is a very warm person very kind

YOU1000000148_S0000045	and so she offered me a guitar a gibson guitar said that was the best president because no one would actually think of me playing guitar when i was at the elysee palace because you know everybody sees you only like a first lady as if you did nothing before right
YOU1000000148_S0000046	so when i got a guitar has a presence i took it as a sign you know such a cool thing to do
YOU1000000148_S0000047	when you became first lady how did your style have to change
YOU1000000148_S0000048	well i i you know i i i throw all the latex away no i'm just kidding

YOU1000000148_S0000052	when i married my husband of course it was about also honoring france
YOU1000000148_S0000053	you know with the style i choose to wear only french designers not only to promote you know french fashion that doesn't really need it
YOU1000000148_S0000054	but because it gave pride you know the french people to have asked such a high standard of beauty and of a savoir faire ah ha what a look

YOU1000000148_S0000056	and this was the video that i made with jombateeste it looks very dark but it's actually a very sensual video that has sort of slow motion in it the look was a catsuit a very simple black catsuit
YOU1000000148_S0000057	the video was made by myself and a double of myself it's quite an interesting video it's a very interesting video very simple but sexy and sort of slow motion

YOU1000000148_S0000060	i mean we almost said in the same time are you doing the research
YOU1000000148_S0000062	i'm so happy that donatella had that idea it was so moving for us
YOU1000000148_S0000063	and so emotional really and this dress was dressed very similar to the one i wore twenty-five or thirty years before it was that dress but short

YOU1000000148_S0000065	red carpet are very special moment i don't do it often when i do it i'm thinking it's quite good fun this looks quite sober i would say
YOU1000000148_S0000066	oh compared to some of the looks you get to seeing the canned film festival which is the traditional you know so it's great it's glamorous you know the only think i wouldn't do in a red carpet is wearing a red dress but no one ever does that
YOU1000000148_S0000068	i know you disappear right
YOU1000000148_S0000070	yeah i do like eighties work i must say since the beginning i liked that even when he was designing clothing for men i would wear a costume that he designed in a few years ago for christian dior man

YOU1000000148_S0000078	my guitar we just wanted to give a very timeless feeling with this ah album cover when i'm in my real life i'm basically always very unsophisticated
YOU1000000148_S0000079	so you know when i think of my music i always think of unsophisticated image

YOU1000000149_S0000001	hi i'm emma chamberlain and i'm gonna be taking you through my every day skin care my every day makeup and my every day hair i just changed the color of it so this is a big deal and you know it deserves a little bit of light
YOU1000000149_S0000002	and my dream is coming true right now cause i've always wanted to do one of these so let's do it okay so step one i'm going to take the nearest headband i have and put it on
YOU1000000149_S0000004	hydrating face mask
YOU1000000149_S0000005	i do this probably three times a week four times a week i'm honestly kind of somebody who just follows my instinct if i feel like my skin is dry i'll do a hydrating skin mask if i feel like my skin is gross
YOU1000000149_S0000006	so i'll do some sort of detoxifying skin mask i'm intuitive with the whole thing
YOU1000000149_S0000008	i've had on and off acne my whole life well since like puberty
YOU1000000149_S0000009	um but my skin really bad in high school and then it got bad again as like an older teen
YOU1000000149_S0000010	and so i decided i'd go on accutane which is a very intense acne medication i did that for seven months last year
YOU1000000149_S0000011	and my acne went away
YOU1000000149_S0000012	by i still have to maintain my skin it actually made me fall in love with skin care in a whole way anyway i will leave this on for ten minutes
YOU1000000149_S0000014	this is a very crucial part of my morning routine i have a really love hate relationship with my acne journey um and there was good and bad moments
YOU1000000149_S0000015	but y'all saw all of it you can go back and see any of it it's been ten minutes i'm washing this off
YOU1000000149_S0000017	now i look like a newborn oh my god my eyebrows my eyebrows are very neglected guys please don't give me a hard time i
YOU1000000149_S0000019	i really gonna do anything to them um
YOU1000000149_S0000021	but moving on first we have this serum that has some sort of snail i mean according to this it's supposed to oh my god
YOU1000000149_S0000022	this is gonna prevent wrinkles that is something i'm starting to worry about anyway i drop a little bit into my hand
YOU1000000149_S0000024	i've always liked
YOU1000000149_S0000026	putting it in my hands more than putting it directly on my face i feel like it always just falls off you know you always see people on like tiktok and stuff going like this
YOU1000000149_S0000027	oh my mine just goes straight onto my shirt when i try to do that
YOU1000000149_S0000028	i don't understand then i use a teatree relief whenever i had a pimple in middle school and i lived with my dad
YOU1000000149_S0000030	he would tell me to put teatree oil on it and that's what he did when he had acne
YOU1000000149_S0000032	thank you dad for the acne tip but it's actually it was kind of nice growing up with parents that also had acne because they kind of felt my pain um
YOU1000000149_S0000033	it runs in the family so i felt like i had this support system of parents that were like we get it next i'm using
YOU1000000149_S0000035	it's so funny because with skin care i'm very interested in it especially recently and especially since i got off accutane because i was like wait a minute
YOU1000000149_S0000036	i don't wanna go through acne again so i need to really work on maintaining my skin and keeping it as healthy and happy as i possibly can
YOU1000000149_S0000037	the crazy thing about skin care that i realized is it is so different for everybody i've tried hundreds of products
YOU1000000149_S0000038	i'm constantly switching it up i'm constantly trying new things this is literally my favorite product this makes me look like a baby's butt on my face it's a hemp oil it's unreal
YOU1000000149_S0000040	when i wake up i look like a vampire i don't know what it is i feel like while i'm sleeping i just lose all of my life in my face and i can't explain it
YOU1000000149_S0000041	this product truly brings the life back to my skin i also try to avoid dairy not only for my extremely disgustingly sensitive stomach
YOU1000000149_S0000042	but also because i think that dairy does make me break out although sometimes it doesn't and then i'm like
YOU1000000149_S0000043	okay so i can put unhealthy amounts of parmesan cheese on everything that i'm eating around the day last step of my skin care routine
YOU1000000149_S0000045	sunscreen i just recently started wearing it daily wear sunscreen
YOU1000000149_S0000046	please like don't be like me and start when you're nineteen and already have had too many sunburns to count on two hands you know what i mean it's just not good i feel like i'm probably wrinkling from it
YOU1000000149_S0000048	you know
YOU1000000149_S0000050	whatever it adds personality lip balm this is huge
YOU1000000149_S0000052	i'm like kind of addicted to lip balm and i have been for many years like i always have a lip balm on me and if i don't
YOU1000000149_S0000053	i'm begging someone to let me borrow theirs which actually is not allowed anymore
YOU1000000149_S0000054	and never will be again it's crazy that i ever did that now in retrospect um that really is some food for thought it's makeup time
YOU1000000149_S0000055	i am a huge fan of a light makeup this is a tinted face oil life changing i i like it is basically acts as like a super light foundation-ish type of thing
YOU1000000149_S0000056	so i put a little bit on my hands i rub it and i just literally like lightly
YOU1000000149_S0000058	rub it in
YOU1000000149_S0000060	but it's like so nice and light
YOU1000000149_S0000062	i started wearing makeup probably eighth grade slash freshman year of high school because i became a cheerleader competitively
YOU1000000149_S0000063	and we had to do crazy hair and makeup and i just ended up getting kind of decent at it then
YOU1000000149_S0000064	when it came to day to day wear i never was huge into it up until recently
YOU1000000149_S0000065	let's really make sure we're looking okay here see how nice and light it is though on your skin it makes you look glowy and like it's an amazing product
YOU1000000149_S0000066	concealer i'm always trying out new concealers because these under eye bags are not
YOU1000000149_S0000068	going away any time soon they are in fact genetic
YOU1000000149_S0000069	it's funny because i'm starting to see people on tiktok draw on under eye bags or under eye dark circles
YOU1000000149_S0000070	with like dark eye shadow and i'm like wait a minute under eye bags are trendy now under eye circles are trendy now count me in
YOU1000000149_S0000072	i like to put this in with my fingers i never i used to use a sponge but i find that it looks more dewy and natural if i use my finger
YOU1000000149_S0000074	i also lip the excess product that are on my fingers on my eyelids it just creates like a nice light base for the things that go there next
YOU1000000149_S0000075	i use powder early in my routine because i just feel like it just prevents from any creasing in my face of whatever's going on here
YOU1000000149_S0000077	let's not comment on my brush usage
YOU1000000149_S0000078	because i literally just choose whatever brush i feel like would work best for what i'm doing i think setting under eyes forehead
YOU1000000149_S0000079	and chin is the most important that i've found and under my nose actually too
YOU1000000149_S0000080	so now we have a nice base
YOU1000000149_S0000081	claiming you good makeup day sometimes saw it bad makeup days anyway whole face with makeup and i'm like this just looks wrong
YOU1000000149_S0000082	but today's a good day so glad that you're here with me we're bronzing now
YOU1000000149_S0000084	you know just a little light dusting never hurt anybody
YOU1000000149_S0000086	highlighter
YOU1000000149_S0000088	the thing that i've learned is less is more and that's because you watch a tutorial and you realize
YOU1000000149_S0000089	you don't need to put the whole bottle of foundation on your hand to make your skin look good you know if anything it'll look works
YOU1000000149_S0000091	eyeshadow
YOU1000000149_S0000093	okay
YOU1000000149_S0000095	sometimes i'll add in like a little bit of a color like this
YOU1000000149_S0000097	into my crease but i make sure that i don't overdo it because it's very easy to overdo it
YOU1000000149_S0000099	my eyes can get over powered very easily so i don't ah i always try to avoid that at all costs
YOU1000000149_S0000101	i am not a big eyeliner person
YOU1000000149_S0000102	so i like to take this kind of medium brown and maybe mix it with a little bit of this brown
YOU1000000149_S0000104	this side is just a nightmare for me trying to get my hand
YOU1000000149_S0000106	can you not
YOU1000000149_S0000108	you wanna say hi to my cat what's up
YOU1000000149_S0000110	okay you're gonna go back outside
YOU1000000149_S0000111	that was fun all right okay if you keep scratching on the door though you're grounded back to work being a cat mom is not easy
YOU1000000149_S0000113	take a little bit of this
YOU1000000149_S0000115	rub it and between my fingers
YOU1000000149_S0000116	just kind of lightly tap it on to the corner i feel like that really lightens my eyes up
YOU1000000149_S0000118	take a brow gel
YOU1000000149_S0000120	keep um nice and fluffy and natural looking
YOU1000000149_S0000121	then i take a little bit of tinted brow gel
YOU1000000149_S0000123	the next few steps of this routine is is just out of order but that's the way i like to do it so bare with me
YOU1000000149_S0000125	i like to wipe all the excess product off my lip
YOU1000000149_S0000127	and then i take this plumping lip cream
YOU1000000149_S0000129	and i put this on and i let it sit while i do the remainder of my look so that my lips can kind of fluff up
YOU1000000149_S0000131	i think that i could use some blush
YOU1000000149_S0000133	this is the only blush i literally own
YOU1000000149_S0000135	i hate the way you just smile when you put on blush
YOU1000000149_S0000136	can you guys look away for a second while i do this
YOU1000000149_S0000138	oh my god this eyelash curler is so gross
YOU1000000149_S0000140	but i've had it for so long it's just the only one that i've found that i like
YOU1000000149_S0000144	all right then we have my mascara the literally is the coolest shape look at it
YOU1000000149_S0000146	how fun is that

YOU1000000149_S0000154	lip liner
YOU1000000149_S0000156	i've always neglected my lips but i feel like they actually pull together a full makeup look and i've recently learned the importance so here we are
YOU1000000149_S0000158	oh my god i'm done what do you think
YOU1000000149_S0000160	now i need to do hair i did just go brunette
YOU1000000149_S0000162	i was blonde for like eight months and i loved every minute of it but
YOU1000000149_S0000164	ah my hair got extremely damaged and so just a few days ago i cut all of it off
YOU1000000149_S0000165	and died it brown dry shampoo duh this ones really good this one has been amazing especially with brown hair it's hard to use dry shampoo because it really just shows up
YOU1000000149_S0000167	dry shampoos also great because it adds volume like why not you know
YOU1000000149_S0000169	okay i'm also somebody that's always loved to have my hair up in a ponytail or up in some way
YOU1000000149_S0000170	and now that my hair is literally this short i can't do that so i have to adapt
YOU1000000149_S0000172	the dry shampoo honestly like weirdly styles it enough to where i'm like satisfied with it but i do like to add a little bit of hair spray
YOU1000000149_S0000174	i will just do anything for volume
YOU1000000149_S0000176	see now looks good because i have to see my own face on the internet every single day it's made me a little bit more obsessive about how i look
YOU1000000149_S0000177	but at the same time it's just about practicing resilience and realizing that you know
YOU1000000149_S0000178	hopefully people aren't following me because they care about my hair color hopefully hopefully they're following me because they wanna hang out with me when i start to get too in my head the phones off

YOU1000000149_S0000180	this is the final look i feel good about it um thank you for hanging out with me i had a lot of fun today and see you around bye
YOU1000000150_S0000000	this is the new bentley continental g t now they all got a bit of a reputation for being driven by people who tend to play with these things for a living
YOU1000000150_S0000002	anyway they still want it may end up being the same because if you got lots of money and he wants it it's really cool and stylish and fast you're gonna go for this now i love the design of this car so it's just so cool
YOU1000000150_S0000003	these crises the chrome detailing the wide haunches here at the back there are some people who have seen it say well i'm not so sure about the rear but i love it i like the way these lights match the exhaust and it's just all kind of sleek and squat and strong
YOU1000000150_S0000004	and now on the front you got a beautiful grill this car is stunning the guy who designed this has created a masterpiece it's for me as beautiful as any constable so yeah
YOU1000000150_S0000005	i'm not talking policeman obviously place i'm talking art guys talking art now this car is not cheap that it starts from just under one hundred and sixty thousand pounds now if you know anyone who is looking to buy a new car click on the pop up on the top right hand corner of the screen or the link below the video

YOU1000000150_S0000008	as you'd imagine the inside of this car is just gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous now the particular car i've got here has got almost fifty thousand pounds worth of options on it and thirty-three thousand pounds of that
YOU1000000150_S0000009	is the first edition specification and signified by this little number one with the union jack there up on the dash so increase stuff like the millennium park which includes diamond quilting the cars has been earning on the air events
YOU1000000150_S0000010	and on various other bits and pieces such as the little organ stops its just feel quality i mean everything is just lovely there's a metal effect for all the switches and things like the door handles are actually solid metal i love it in here
YOU1000000150_S0000011	i really do then there's attention to details such as the way the vets match up to this metal strip that goes all the way around the cabin i mean that is really pleasing my old c d recently the normally wouldn't for instance the stitching up on here
YOU1000000150_S0000012	doesn't mean i'm the somewhat i can forgive it though i can't tell you why it's because this is hand stitched now this was done by a robot i want it dead straight but the fact that it is slightly wonky it's kind of
YOU1000000150_S0000013	let's you know that it's been done by a man obviously had been a japanese person would probably be dead straight but that's british that's what we like in england and it's a bit like john lennon's voice the fact that it's imperfect is what makes it so perfect
YOU1000000150_S0000014	and the leather quality throughout ah just look it's so super soft it's not like a boutique tailored feel to it there are a few things i'm not so sure about that so you've got digital dolls in this car and
YOU1000000150_S0000015	they're really functional and i like what they've done with them they look almost real the way they got like a three d effect partly just want old fashioned analog dials
YOU1000000150_S0000016	but there is a great functionality with this so you can do things like look at the the sat nav make it go widescreen connect your phone look through various functions and
YOU1000000150_S0000017	yeah it's all good and there's a wide screen entertainment display which it it's okay to use it you can tell it's based on the system used by audi for some reason they try to personalize it make it a bit more bentley but it's
YOU1000000150_S0000018	it's actually not as easy to use and if you click on the pop out on the top right hand corner of the screen on the link below the video you can actually see my full in depth review of the entertainment system now that brings you into something else because there are a few parts in here that's you will find in other v w products say such as
YOU1000000150_S0000019	these switches on the steering wheel i bet a lot of those you get in the golf now journalists may complain about that but the fact is someone who buys this car has never been anywhere near a golf nor their friends there any golfer you know is played at saint andrews or pebble beach
YOU1000000150_S0000020	so it's functionally works it doesn't really matter and it doesn't feel cheap in fact all the switches with the metal effect like i say it's just gosh it's lovely some of these switches down here they're nice and laid out but it can be a bit confusing to use when you're driving but you can feel your way around them okay
YOU1000000150_S0000021	and there is a decent amount of storage and here we've got huge door bins which is handy for your bottle of water down here there's a special storage area which i imagine it could be used for your cigars but i don't have any cubans so i'm having to use
YOU1000000150_S0000023	to illustrate that there is a bit of storage and hit the glove box is not the largest but it's okay you can put your expensive leather gloves and there is a bit more storage into their and this guy actually has a wireless charging point for your mobile phone
YOU1000000150_S0000024	and then on the other hand there is some really deep cup holders i mean look at that look at the way that opens i mean the quality and here is just impeccable you know that would just feels great and even the speaker covers for this upgraded name audio system which
YOU1000000150_S0000025	by the way it's so loud and the bass is thumping its almost like thunder it's so good that feels glorious everything you touch and feel is glorious however what's it like for people in the back this is supposed to be a four-seater coupe
YOU1000000150_S0000026	so come on yes that will slide out the way good shouldn't have to do anything manually in this bentley also the door
YOU1000000150_S0000027	there you go soft close and it's got this little seat belt buckle up there so you don't reach for your own belt now i'm just gonna put the seat back i've never been in the rear of this car before let's see what it's like is he gonna crush my legs
YOU1000000150_S0000029	no just about going off the room foot space is a little bit tight in the seat is rather deep so it's actually pressing against my car so it's not the most comfy back here in her dreams tight as well though my head is touching this beautiful leather roof lining
YOU1000000150_S0000030	not only what product in my head it's gonna end up leaving the state and that these things are gorgeous you got your own rear windows as well which is nice it's a bit of fresh air in this in storage and cup holders and here you've got twelve volt socket you've got
YOU1000000150_S0000031	charging point for your mobile phone you've even got some through loading if you want to carry skis in the back and look at this it's a bit unusual never had that before normally this would be hidden just but yes i can put it on ebay for about five hundred pounds now let's check out
YOU1000000150_S0000032	the boot because yeah this is quite a big car but i don't reckon it's got the biggest boobs i think you know it's a sporty coupe
YOU1000000150_S0000034	but it's decent enough in size i mean look at that you can fit a large suitcase and there was a bit of a little left over but to stop your scratching your paint work there is a scuff plate here i think it might be plastic but it looks like metal and i'll forgive it because quality in the booth here is really good
YOU1000000150_S0000035	even the carpets here are thick and almost as thick as in the front and check this out for the twelve volt socket look at that it's damped now the thing with this boot is that they're designed to be wide enough to take
YOU1000000150_S0000037	a set of golf clubs look golf clubs
YOU1000000150_S0000039	it's quite easily now if you want more detail on this car is practical it's a click on the pop out on the top right hand corner of the screen we'll see just how much stuff you can fit in these cars boats and some other things as well
YOU1000000150_S0000040	however this car isn't all perfect here is five annoying things about it
YOU1000000150_S0000042	this steering wheel looks super lovely and i really like the large bentley logo since porsche same then cause they have to ride air bag so big you gonna need it air bag
YOU1000000150_S0000043	the surrounds of these parking sensors just took off there any properly there for some reason you can't get a bentley continental g t with android auto why is that because android phones are as good as iphones i think not because the new galaxy
YOU1000000150_S0000044	s nine is definitely better than an iphone ten discuss in the comment box below i love the shiny grill it just looks expensive shame then that the rest of the events of cheap plastic mesh kind of thing that you find on the budget x back
YOU1000000150_S0000045	when you're driving the light reflects in the shining street but it catch in the corner of eye and you wasting in a vehicle just in your blind spot don't worry there's still plenty to like about this car here's the carwow five cool features the head up display is really big
YOU1000000150_S0000046	and bright and very useful when you're driving you can show things like the direction from the satellite navigation your speed and the actual speed limit when you put the risk spoiler up manually it shows that you've done that on a little graphic on the cars display just kind of cool
YOU1000000150_S0000047	i absolutely love the look of the lights they have been designed to look like diamonds maybe they're swarovski crystals that isn't bad isn't it definitely diamond digital display a little bit too modern for you
YOU1000000150_S0000048	don't worry you can turn back time by rotating the screen around there's an analog dials and then when you turn the car off you can always just flip away
YOU1000000150_S0000050	revealed just a nice clean simple wooden surface these are the biggest iron brake discs on any production car there four hundred twenty millimeters in diameter it's no wonder it stops as well
YOU1000000150_S0000051	now it's time to hit the road to see what this car is like to drive
YOU1000000150_S0000053	how fast can the car which weighs two point two tonnes actually be well we're gonna find out because i've got some special timing equipment up there on the launch this bentley
YOU1000000150_S0000055	chraicky
YOU1000000150_S0000057	this is nuts
YOU1000000150_S0000059	whoa wow wow wow wow wow wow
YOU1000000150_S0000061	i've got to hand it to the brakes first of all i mean they slammed on the anchors that's good news the brakes are good but what about the performance
YOU1000000150_S0000063	the stunning quartz time is eleven point seven seconds and check out the north sixty as well it's supposed to be in three point seven seconds but what did i get three point six seconds
YOU1000000150_S0000065	this is rapid so then why is his car so blooming quick well that's because underneath the bonnet is a six liter w twelve twin turbocharged petrol engine with
YOU1000000150_S0000066	six hundred thirty-five horsepower and nine hundred newton metres of torque
YOU1000000150_S0000067	and i love this engine it is so powerful there's something almost geological to it in a way it's it's relentless and it makes the noise
YOU1000000150_S0000069	ah what a routing volcano it is so good now there is a small matter of economy and emissions which yeah they're not great they're not great but i am actually averaging twenty two miles per gallon
YOU1000000150_S0000070	now that could be quite expensive but if you can afford this car you don't care about that what's more important is how far you can go between fuel stops and this guy is a big petrol tanks with that economy
YOU1000000150_S0000072	i could go back four hundred fifty miles between having to pull up and rub shoulders with normal people at a petrol station i can't twist the dial down here and put everything in comfort mode and it softens off the air suspension
YOU1000000150_S0000073	and then does a thorough response makes the steering a bit lighter and it's all free and relaxing and comfy the best mode there is a special bentley mode which is the best of both worlds between sporting us and converting yeah you took it into a corner
YOU1000000150_S0000074	and it somehow grips and goes round for instance on a twisty road now and
YOU1000000150_S0000076	it's surprisingly good you see this new continental g t seems to just continue just holding its line where if the old one would have kind of just run out of talent and started to wobble off the road it is genuinely good fun when you get the opportunity
YOU1000000150_S0000077	that's right about a bit
YOU1000000150_S0000079	that's being wrong thing in this it's a bit like driving the british museum and fast on the road
YOU1000000150_S0000081	so you can do with total confidence i mean the four wheel drive system just grapes and grapes and grapes it's really really impressive
YOU1000000150_S0000083	and you can send loads of power to the back of an israeli drive by so it feels sporty
YOU1000000150_S0000084	i mean yeah it's it's not quite as agile as something like a ferrari g t c four less so but i think it's nicer inside but i could live like this i could what a car actually i'm being very critical um
YOU1000000150_S0000085	there is something i don't like about the driving experience and that's the real visibility which is kind of a letter box like that's the best way to describe it ah let me see if there's anything else i don't like
YOU1000000150_S0000087	now if you click on the pop out on the top right hand corner of the screen or the link below the video you can get a carwow dot com to see how much you can save on a new car so that was my final verdict on the bentley continental g t should you avoid it should you consider it should you short list it
YOU1000000150_S0000088	or should you just go right ahead and buy it well you know what if i win the lottery or if i was a football player i buy it i love this car i really do

YOU1000000150_S0000092	now did you spot the easter egg in this video it was the continental chocolates in the course glove box
YOU1000000151_S0000001	the f r x and its sisters have got a lot of attention as the affordable enthusiast rear wheel drive car the de facto standard however the british pioneer this idea and the japanese were finding so we brought along
YOU1000000151_S0000003	two thousand and a mazda r x eight to find out if the f r s truly is the best example
YOU1000000151_S0000004	and these are the two that you've asked for and we've had so many requests
YOU1000000151_S0000006	i'm excited to do it but i am a little concerned i may have dug myself a hole
YOU1000000151_S0000007	also what's wrong
YOU1000000151_S0000008	well on the p c h ps i i may have said i may have said that the f r s is better than
YOU1000000151_S0000010	i think you did say that
YOU1000000151_S0000011	i think i need to so now i am prepared to be wrong we have them here i am prepared to drive them i prepared to be wrong
YOU1000000151_S0000012	i think i'm gonna be wrong too i think
YOU1000000151_S0000013	well actually you know what no matter how this goes the fan boys for these cars are so serious
YOU1000000151_S0000014	oh that's true this is this is the wrong review these are wrong
YOU1000000151_S0000016	whatever we say
YOU1000000151_S0000018	this is about the only time you're gonna see all three of these cars unbiased by non owners together that's why we're here you've asked for it so let's go be wrong
YOU1000000151_S0000020	so here is the same white f r s we had on our pacific coast highway shooter
YOU1000000151_S0000022	it's one of the first eighty-six f r s that were in the country and i just like this car
YOU1000000151_S0000023	it's always nice to get back in a car that you remembered loving and it didn't let you down
YOU1000000151_S0000025	the f r s is not disappointing me personally i feel like the v r z is the better set up however and i'm getting back to thinking i loved it but we were comparing against different cars
YOU1000000151_S0000026	the two cars we brought along with it pretty steep competition
YOU1000000151_S0000028	last time we drove the arctic for the show it was an old four this is a two thousand eleven and in fact the last three sold in southern california and i maintain everything about this car is just odd
YOU1000000151_S0000029	kind of skill to unique the second generation r x eight is definitely more refined than the first generation
YOU1000000151_S0000030	after having driven the first generation r x eight i feel like that car was more willing just slightly more willing than this car but what i don't feel like they've done is completely taken away that fun to drive that just
YOU1000000151_S0000031	brilliant enthusiasm so this car represents the most sorted best example of the r x eight
YOU1000000151_S0000033	of course there's two versions of the honda s two thousand and they are much debated the a p one and a p two this is the a p two if you want to go with the a p one version with a higher redline and a little bit more tail happy suspension
YOU1000000151_S0000034	that you can get them cheaper put in is a key to the definitely refined the cocked hat of course you're buying one of the most reliable source supper made the guy that owns this guy almost eighty thousand miles on it is never done anything more than standard maintenance
YOU1000000151_S0000035	what's great is you've got that nearly bulletproof nature of honda cars you don't have to worry about beating on this thing now the car we're driving today is the car we drove in our stand alone on s two thousand review so driving it later
YOU1000000151_S0000036	it's got of course more miles and it still feels fresh i'm sad to say these guys are no longer the market and it's also a tragedy that honda is building things like the honda parameter i mean the hand across to her
YOU1000000151_S0000038	getting right out of the other cars in the f r s is truly revealing i wasn't thinking that the f r s needed more power i thought it was fine
YOU1000000151_S0000040	i'm wrong about them in spite of being the least powerful the f r s is actually be easier to launch little also runs out of breath the fastest running about about five thousand r p m to put your foot to the floor
YOU1000000151_S0000041	you expect that extra little surge when he meant the gas and it just doesn't happen here i am stepping on the throttle and i feel like the f r s is holding something back
YOU1000000151_S0000043	and that feeling isn't that it's holding something back it just doesn't have any more to give
YOU1000000151_S0000045	now this s two thousand has the forty more horsepower that we wish we had them in f r s
YOU1000000151_S0000047	but has almost the exact same tour
YOU1000000151_S0000049	so because of a horse the much loved honda v tech engine you got a rather pretty high to find the power in this car
YOU1000000151_S0000050	there's enough there i'm not wanting for power and as hard as you can read the it's just it constant surge
YOU1000000151_S0000052	and you feel that b tag changeover run about six thousand r p ms and it give you the actual kick in the ass when the f r s is just dying away in two thousand is a second faster zero to sixty than the f r s
YOU1000000151_S0000053	i mean that's pretty much the only stat you need to know to remind you that the f r s is just under power
YOU1000000151_S0000055	the r x eight also has the missing ingredients the f r s does not more power
YOU1000000151_S0000056	and this engine in spite of the fact that it's a typical in spite of the fact that its reputation is not all that reliable it's so silky smooth it feels like somehow this engine is better lubricated and better built than anything you've ever driven
YOU1000000151_S0000057	there's no vibration just sings up through the r p f headed toward its nine thousand r p m redline however even though the r x eight is more powerful in the f r s doesn't actually feel like it
YOU1000000151_S0000058	it's not really any faster it like the f r s never gives me as much as i expect
YOU1000000151_S0000060	the r x eight makes great power you're just gonna not think that it does anywhere below five thousand r p m
YOU1000000151_S0000062	you've gotta grab this car by the scruff of the neck smack it around and make your bitch otherwise you're not gonna be smiling once you do you will be happy
YOU1000000151_S0000064	now i will acknowledge that for every person you hear about who's going a hundred fifty thousand miles on their first rotary engine there's the guy next to him with an r x eight done three engines in two hundred fifty thousand miles the big trick is these engines burn a lot of gas
YOU1000000151_S0000065	and they burn a lot of oil just during the hard driving of the shoot we've burned almost a half quarter of oil
YOU1000000151_S0000067	now what's interesting about all three of these cars is they've got electric power steering
YOU1000000151_S0000068	for all the complaints that are happening right now for poor electric steering racks in cars each of these three cars have electric power steering and all of them get it right
YOU1000000151_S0000069	so famous associated electric power steering with something that doesn't feel right when you're driving a field goal or have good steering feedback you're completely wrong
YOU1000000151_S0000071	now the steering on the r x eight doesn't feel quite a sure what's nice is the hardest to push this car the better you get
YOU1000000151_S0000072	to compare the r x eight sneering to most cars it's probably going to win it is a very informative steering rack but it feels larger and more disconnected than the other two cars
YOU1000000151_S0000074	if you think the handling on the r x eight is not you ought to have your head examined i would say the steering feels slightly muted but it doesn't feel now
YOU1000000151_S0000076	this is so strange i can feel the longer wheelbase but a plants itself so well
YOU1000000151_S0000078	now this r three makes a far more aggressive it's got a stiffer suspension and in fact this car has the longest wheelbase but the worst cried on the highway it just kind of vibrates in puffs as you go along north normal highway speeds
YOU1000000151_S0000080	even in this company the f r s is incredibly easy car to drive very fast now force they can't get up to speed is found but what's your their biscuit hang on to speak in corners almost better than the other two
YOU1000000151_S0000081	for the better side tires on a huguenot gripped them both but the great thing is this just tells you so much about what's going on better give you a lot of confidence partly because the limits in the forest alone on that you could approach them safely and you can feel them coming
YOU1000000151_S0000083	some ways the effort as like having a really good navigator they're telling you information all the time and the fast you drive the more the information just increases
YOU1000000151_S0000084	i really do love the flexibility of this car it really does seem like it's on the edge
YOU1000000151_S0000086	the chassis dynamics are good because of the low center of gravity because a player that engine is bad but determined f r s from really really good into rate it needs more power
YOU1000000151_S0000087	i was wrong
YOU1000000151_S0000089	it's good
YOU1000000151_S0000091	but it isn't the honda s two thousand
YOU1000000151_S0000093	there's c row body rover in this car i mean short of like the corvette zero one we drove this is got the least body roll i've ever felt and of course the s two thousand francs a fifty fifty weight distribution and it weights as far as the f r s weights
YOU1000000151_S0000095	this car's handling is unbelievably sharp and what i love is you can just roll on the floor and push harder harder
YOU1000000151_S0000097	through the corner just like you do a motorcycle the heart you roll on the throttle the more settled the car
YOU1000000151_S0000098	the f r s has a little bit better initial turn because the steering rack is tighter but the s two thousand seems to link the coroner or more consistently than f r s it get a little bit sly little bit of scruff going on the s two thousand just clings hangs on
YOU1000000151_S0000100	getting back in the f r s is like looking up your high school sweetheart on facebook
YOU1000000151_S0000102	finding out that she is
YOU1000000151_S0000104	almost as good as you remember her but here's the thing about the f r s this is version one point
YOU1000000151_S0000106	designed this car is made specifically with the thinking mind that
YOU1000000151_S0000107	people would be adding to it however i want this car to be just that much better it's so good why can't it be right
YOU1000000151_S0000108	i really do love is car i step away for a while i think it really probably wasn't that good but come back and i realize you know what the f r s is overhyped but the ungulate it's gotten are completely deserted
YOU1000000151_S0000109	this is a really impressive car it is a rewarding and fun to drive car but how rarely is that available in twenty five brand new
YOU1000000151_S0000111	this has all the refinement and fine tuning the the f r s just hasn't got yet i expect that it will but the r x eight is about as great as this car going again and it feels very refined
YOU1000000151_S0000112	i remember liking the first generation r x eight it was very willing and i love this car even more
YOU1000000151_S0000113	now think about the arctic for me is that i'm very impressed i respect him i just can't fall in love with it
YOU1000000151_S0000115	it's like meeting a friend of yours girlfriend and you recognize that she's hot but for whatever reason she doesn't do anything for you
YOU1000000151_S0000117	i've got to listen to my heart i've got to listen to the car that made me cringe as soon as i got into the again you're looking for the most pure the clearest driving experience
YOU1000000151_S0000118	for enthusiasts it's the honda s two thousand
YOU1000000151_S0000119	now the downsized to the s two thousand can put me in a dilemma on its cramped in here it's loud you got us in the engine running to the stratosphere to give me power out of it these are all the same issues i have with the lotus elise
YOU1000000151_S0000120	added twenty five to thirty grams of fiscal by the lotus by the fifteen to twenty grands this car makes all kinds of sense
YOU1000000151_S0000122	what a day
YOU1000000151_S0000124	and what an amazing three cars
YOU1000000151_S0000126	i said it each of these critiquing them and thinking we're splitting hairs here
YOU1000000151_S0000127	we are this is whisker differences and i i'm honest when i say i came into the day with hope in mind truly i kind of thought i'd come and pick in the f r s and i didn't i love the f r s
YOU1000000151_S0000128	it's a great car
YOU1000000151_S0000129	it's fantastic but the car i jumped into and just started smiling i knew was the winner for me and that was the s two thousand
YOU1000000151_S0000130	i wanted the f r s to live up to the hype would be the best out here and i have to say i love it it's a great car is still a four star it's little my top five all those things but the s two thousand is better
YOU1000000151_S0000131	i can't believe a car that's ten years old is still so fantastic this is honda at the top of their game
YOU1000000151_S0000132	yeah where has that car gone in honda's lineup i not the car you know me i'm not a big fan convertibles that's the cars would make him buy a convertible i like it's that it's an incredible car
YOU1000000151_S0000133	well these two cars also answered the burning question does the f r s need more power
YOU1000000151_S0000135	now i realize that should and these cars have forty more horsepower
YOU1000000151_S0000137	and they have better weight distribution so they're a bit more predictable not that they are as bad though
YOU1000000151_S0000139	i really like this car i should put another way i respected this car
YOU1000000151_S0000140	okay
YOU1000000151_S0000141	i can't fall in love with i don't know what it is about the other two just sparked me i fall in love with those two cars i've got to put the r x eight third but not because the bad car it's a great car just not caught for me i actually don't feel like that is as powerful as i wanted to be
YOU1000000151_S0000143	with the f r s for the s two thousand just proves out twenty-eight hundred pounds with two hundred forty horse power the recipe starts to be exact and this one gets the closed but it just falls short if you drove them by themselves
YOU1000000151_S0000145	fantastic car you'd have no awareness that it could be different or better
YOU1000000151_S0000146	and of course our decisions could be wrong again
YOU1000000151_S0000148	with these cars they will be wrong someone will hate yourself a someone will love us tell us in the comments we want to hear it from you
YOU1000000151_S0000150	don't get me wrong it's great
YOU1000000151_S0000152	but it isn't first place great not compared to these other two cars the f r s ties the s two thousand for best steering feel they're both good at different things
YOU1000000151_S0000153	it's got my second favorite gearbox is not nearly as good as the one in the s two thousand
YOU1000000151_S0000155	when i drive it i find that the most endearing it talks to me the most it warms up to me the best the car that i just want to get into in any condition and that's pretty remarkable
YOU1000000151_S0000156	if you can find a r three you can find one for sale
YOU1000000151_S0000158	buy this car the faster you go the more fun you have and it just it turns into a race car
YOU1000000151_S0000159	i've genuinely impressed but i don't lust after the car i don't want one and i do the other two
YOU1000000151_S0000160	frankly i didn't think this car would win for me but you realize this represents honda at the peak of their powers i don't understand why honda has gone completely off the rails
YOU1000000151_S0000161	and gotten away from making brilliant driving machines likely the s two thousand
YOU1000000151_S0000162	i will admit that i'm not really a convertible guy went on a day like this on a road like this this car just make a lot of sense

YOU1000000153_S0000008	it's nice to meed you and super cool to see this beautiful home
YOU1000000153_S0000009	thank you we're really glad to have you here
YOU1000000153_S0000010	so how did you come to be living in a tiny house
YOU1000000153_S0000011	ah well we actually found out about moving through on your videos so um i was binge watching the videos and i send one altar to greg and then said hey why don't we build a tiny house and to my surprise he agreed and
YOU1000000153_S0000012	took that and ran with him before he could change his mind so you know in a few month so ah we had a tiny house of our own
YOU1000000153_S0000013	and you really have found a fantastic parking spot for the home as well
YOU1000000153_S0000014	yeah we're really lucky because ah one our friend has been kind enough to just let us park up here on our property and one other guy products essentially so yes it's really nice we get a nice view it's very quiet get away from a lot of street noise and just
YOU1000000153_S0000015	peaceful
YOU1000000153_S0000016	yeah it gives us a bit of land as well to have a veggie patch and everything like that so and we have that nice community spirit with her can have on a family dinner before night and yeah i couldn't want more i guess
YOU1000000153_S0000017	and what was that made you really fall in love with the idea of living in a tiny house
YOU1000000153_S0000018	i think for us it's probably the simplicity of the lifestyle i think also the financial freedom so that's probably the biggest pot for us we'd ought to be tied down to a job and then he now we can live a lifestyle we truly love
YOU1000000153_S0000019	yeah definitely yeah
YOU1000000153_S0000020	and tell me a little bit about the aesthetic of this home it's beautifully crafted
YOU1000000153_S0000021	well honestly mercer was may we did mainly from everything from the outside is mainly based from around the joint window we decided that any room that we were going to have inside we will make sure we could
YOU1000000153_S0000022	really spend a lot of time outside enjoying it so
YOU1000000153_S0000023	yeah i think i want something i can sink into the background so nothing that stand out so much and i like to think the state of the natural look at that and i think whilst they can still sink into the background and doesn't stand out too much it's really quite striking and modern
YOU1000000153_S0000024	and we really did spend a little time we wherein in a bigger house we spend a lot more time in outdoor areas was so on we kept the same outdoor area and just made made a bit more space essentially when we had there
YOU1000000153_S0000025	that's it so all of the decking as much a last greg spent hours laboring away with hollywood and everything so i could keep the the costs down and ah minimize the footprint on on everything is well so
YOU1000000153_S0000026	john that said if we have to move we can't put all upon it would be a difficult task when a simple but it can be done and we can take it to our next parking spot
YOU1000000153_S0000027	really good sized water tank here is well
YOU1000000153_S0000028	yes so i think what it was okay we managed to make it through the drought period that we will here only just before he got all that downpour which was great but having the two kids in the house we really need a large tank so we have gone with a ten thousand litre tank there
YOU1000000153_S0000029	collarbone so it wasn't plastic which is important for the quality of water for us and it ties in really nicely with the design of the house so that was a bonus
YOU1000000153_S0000030	i know most of the time you live here by yourselves but greg sometimes you have your kids over as well don't you
YOU1000000153_S0000031	yes every second week for five days we have them um my son who is turning thirteen this year and my daughter who is ten we thought they'd have a bit of trouble adapting to it but it was honestly very smooth when we introduced them to the house they get excited and then
YOU1000000153_S0000032	it was like yeah we have somewhere to sleep now let's go play outside
YOU1000000153_S0000033	and so what size is the tiny house
YOU1000000153_S0000034	ah so this one is seven point two meters long that's two point four wide and about four point two high so we try to keep it all up with the legal aspects to be able to happen on the road
YOU1000000153_S0000035	well the house is just beautiful from the outside i really love this wonderful entertaining dig that you've built onto it and i cannot wait to see what you've got going on inside shall we check it out
YOU1000000153_S0000036	yes let's do
YOU1000000153_S0000037	all right thank you
YOU1000000153_S0000039	oh this is gorgeous
YOU1000000153_S0000040	thank you we all very proud of it
YOU1000000153_S0000041	it's especially beautiful just walking in and immediately being greeted by this very comfortable looking lounge
YOU1000000153_S0000042	yeah aim comfort was the main goal with this so we found that in a regular sized house we spent a lot of time in the lounge room on the couch watching movies playing games with the kids so we need an account that could accommodate all four of us
YOU1000000153_S0000043	and be comfortable so we designed the layout actually of the lounge room based off the size of this account so other chaise does double as storage which is always important in your tiny house
YOU1000000153_S0000045	the bed obviously pulled out from under there as well which is great to have that extra sleeping space if you need it
YOU1000000153_S0000046	we actually find that we'd spread that out more often than not to have more family time really we spend more time with it i'll just hanging out like that rather than just in this l shaped couch
YOU1000000153_S0000047	formal seating so well actually lays out what is the movie playing games
YOU1000000153_S0000048	yeah so
YOU1000000153_S0000049	sounds good to me and lots of windows here giving you really nice views into the outdoors
YOU1000000153_S0000050	yeah we really want to capitalize on the view and bring in as much natural light as possible for a tiny house i think it's a bit small i can feel even smaller if it doesn't have that natural light and that just makes a few area brightened does it make you feel so claustrophobic i think
YOU1000000153_S0000052	and then we also get a beautiful cross phase which is essential in the hot weather here is so that helps as well keeps the place cool
YOU1000000153_S0000053	yeah it certainly is essential because the weather here you really do get some extremes don't you
YOU1000000153_S0000055	so i think in the last few months had floods and droughts so you know this is been a great way to be able to still keep cool and keep that electricity bill down so
YOU1000000153_S0000056	and then you've got a really good sized kitchen here
YOU1000000153_S0000057	yeah so we do a lot of meal prepping so we thought we would like a big bench i think that was key for us because we do the meal prepping together so we need to be able to work together in the space at one time and them also doubles as a great space to be able to work and have our food as well
YOU1000000153_S0000058	study space so originally we made sure this bench space that is at the end here was mainly just so that we could do work or study there as well so we've got space to do it
YOU1000000153_S0000059	yeah and we also want to have a lot of overhead cupboard space there as well for storage and to keep it nice and tidy rather than an open shelving just because it's quite dusty out here in the bush area
YOU1000000153_S0000060	and it's so lovely how this window here can just completely open the kitchen up to the outdoors
YOU1000000153_S0000061	yeah so we actually designed a lot of the house around the bi-fold window there and when it opens up it really does brings the outside in we use it a lot with
YOU1000000153_S0000062	if we have friends over we meal prep here and just hand the meals over there and we can all still talk and and communicate together and this sort of starts to feel more like an island bench in the kitchen rather than a wall separating you guys and it's really cool
YOU1000000153_S0000063	and then really good size appliances here in the kitchen full size fridge and lots of storage that's been built into the stairs there too
YOU1000000153_S0000064	yes so um this was a little bit to get it to work the um fridge was from our previous um state house and we want to keep that just because we like the design of the fringe space being over the top we've popped our microwave in here which is
YOU1000000153_S0000065	keeping it nice and well hidden also has extra stories we're talking boards and bread which is really great to keep the cat and it's nice and clear up here the rest of the story shower is actually for our clothing and then behind these baskets we've got quite a deep space here
YOU1000000153_S0000066	so we can hide extra items like ah ah blender in there as well as the clothing on the spot up there all the dog stuff as well keep it all neat and tidy and keeps up benches clear which is really good
YOU1000000153_S0000067	yeah and because we like to food prep so much not downsizing in the oven was essential for us as well so we need to make sure that we kept that up on the right size we downgraded to the two burner stove but that wasn't an issue really because
YOU1000000153_S0000068	yeah we do things out of a slow cooker or the oven the rest of the time so it wasn't really a problem
YOU1000000153_S0000069	and the other stories that we really love it here is actually a pull out pantry so um a lot of work went into that and we actually measured out how think we need it to be to fit jobs and everything so make most of that space as well
YOU1000000153_S0000070	then we've got the loft above us here
YOU1000000153_S0000071	yes so that was actually in addition that we added to the standard design with this one we need to have a space for the children as well so that's really great because um they can have their own space and be apart from us but they are still part of the family unit
YOU1000000153_S0000072	um we chose not to enclose it just so i could have that open field and also to limit it getting to hot up there with the cross braces as well
YOU1000000153_S0000073	and then through there we have your bathroom and it's really nice how you created this full length of a window
YOU1000000153_S0000074	yes ah the window we wanted to create a space i guess where from one end of the house to the other it was really open ended so when you're sitting in the lounge room and looking through
YOU1000000153_S0000075	um you just see straight out into nature and it doesn't just cut the household and feel like it suddenly ends
YOU1000000153_S0000076	great size shall we have gotten here
YOU1000000153_S0000077	yeah so it's um not quite the same as the nine hundred i think eight twenty by eight twenty so a little bit smaller than normal but we have a beautiful waterfall shower head which makes it really look serious to have a shower in there
YOU1000000153_S0000078	um we also have the addition of another labor window there just to try to bring the inside out again and also to extract some of that steam which can cause a bit of trouble in a tiny space as well so feels very lovely having a shower and they're actually probably better than our own house
YOU1000000153_S0000079	it's one of the best shows we've ever had in that thing so yeah it's amazing
YOU1000000153_S0000080	and then it's great to see you've got the composting toilet here
YOU1000000153_S0000081	yes so that was probably our favorite thing about the house moving into it yeah where's the toilet when we ask that question um i think it's just that so unique in design and being in a drought area i guess it's so great with the water usage
YOU1000000153_S0000083	yeah we think that was one of the things that helped us get through a part of that drought period before we started to get all the floods was the fact that we did not have a flushing toilet be like we were getting very close at the end of our tank and we thankfully got the rain but yeah the the composting toilet like it doesn't use
YOU1000000153_S0000084	water to get rid of it it's so much easier
YOU1000000153_S0000085	and great to see you've got the washing machine there as well
YOU1000000153_S0000087	that's it from my old house as well which worked out really well and have to buy new appliances no need for a dryer in in this climate so we just hang up on the outside on the deck or in the sun so
YOU1000000153_S0000088	we do make sure that we use um a lot of the eco friendly dishwashing liquid and laundry detergent is the same as well so that when it runs off to wear grey water because we use that out and now crosses and gardens and things like that we will help
YOU1000000153_S0000089	yeah we're not putting anything toxic out into the environment as well
YOU1000000153_S0000090	of course
YOU1000000153_S0000091	like recycled water we can here
YOU1000000153_S0000092	yeah and then really nice size menacing in here as well
YOU1000000153_S0000093	yes so um i think every girl wants a nice big fantasy so this was kind of my brain child i wanted the pendant lights and the shelving for my beauty products um a big nice thing to be able to wash my face and do my makeup
YOU1000000153_S0000095	and i think it just it works really well as well with the kids um generally getting the kids ready for school there's two of them in the bathroom it's nice and big they can both still brush their teeth through their hair do it then at the same time when i was fighting and yeah well that's good
YOU1000000153_S0000096	obviously we've got you sleeping well
YOU1000000153_S0000097	yes our little sanctuary
YOU1000000153_S0000099	this is just so cozy up here and having that skylight is just lovely isn't it
YOU1000000153_S0000100	yeah this this loft is it's it's our sanctuary and this skylight really just makes it what it is it brings in all that light
YOU1000000153_S0000101	yeah i think even compared to um ah bedrooms at the previous homes this is probably the most comfortable and luxurious that we've had we invested in a good mattress that was a little bit thinner so i could gain a little bit of extra room
YOU1000000153_S0000102	and yeah it's been a lovely experience being out here
YOU1000000153_S0000103	i think that a lot of people see sleeping loft and they immediately kind of freak out and say i could never do that but there really is something which is just so cozy and comfortable about climbing into a loft and you feel so protected in a space like this don't you
YOU1000000153_S0000105	so it's like an astronaut and safe i think if we had been closed maybe the front portion of it might feel a little bit more claustrophobic but it's so airy and bright and i think you know we don't feel confined or anything like that it's very open
YOU1000000153_S0000106	the view that we have is quite nice as well and we get the views out to the sides and at night we get the the night sky it's it's amazing up here it's not anything to really be worried about it's one of those things that we look forward to
YOU1000000153_S0000107	yeah and i think ah a lot of people are nervous about the transition to a loft style and it's probably not ideal for people with mobility issues but the stairs are easy to navigate we haven't had any issues got handrail there and everything to help so
YOU1000000153_S0000108	yeah it's been an easy transition
YOU1000000153_S0000109	and so how long have you been living in this tiny house now
YOU1000000153_S0000110	i think we're going on just on six months now all full time living in a tiny house so it's gone really fast actually
YOU1000000153_S0000111	we didn't weak actually believe we went like four months without a t v
YOU1000000153_S0000112	yeah i mean time goes so fast again and i think in another sense it also doesn't feel like it's only been six months and you know it wasn't easy change of lifestyle change of pace and and it's just been such an easy transition into it that i think it feels like
YOU1000000153_S0000113	it's something we've been doing for years and i think we spent such a long time in the design phase and the builders worked so closely with us i don't think there's anything that's gone into this that isn't a well thought out process
YOU1000000153_S0000114	yeah a lot of people ask us you know are you over the tiny house yet and and it's
YOU1000000153_S0000116	in love with the design everyday so and and the lifestyle offers
YOU1000000153_S0000117	absolutely
YOU1000000153_S0000118	and can we talk a little bit about price what did this cost to build
YOU1000000153_S0000119	so all up we spent about a hundred thousand so that included the build finishing the water tank delivery so significantly less than a mortgage
YOU1000000153_S0000120	everything we pay for daily or through monthly now as well has significantly dropped like electricity prices like we're not off grid yet but we do plan on this being a solar powered house eventually as well
YOU1000000153_S0000121	with water like we said we've got a ten thousand litre tank and that gets us by fine it's just been a very comfortable transition with money wise as well like expenditures going out is another thing that made it very comfortable
YOU1000000153_S0000122	yeah absolutely
YOU1000000153_S0000123	and so what does the future hold for you both now
YOU1000000153_S0000124	honestly hopefully a lot more travel and exploring and living life and enjoying it so hopefully the freedom that comes with this tiny will allow us to um become financially free as well
YOU1000000153_S0000125	and um have a five year plan hopefully buy a big block of our own and yeah just see where it takes us i guess
YOU1000000153_S0000126	yeah we're excited to be able to um hopefully take this over to a bigger block in yeah i don't think we could ever do a a normal sized house ever again though we have tiny is something we will stick with ah yeah we'll definitely be doing a lot more living again now cause
YOU1000000153_S0000127	we can yes it's really opened up a lot of freedom in our lives and it seems weird to say that i moved into a smaller house so now i'm more free but like once you do it you really get it you know it's
YOU1000000153_S0000128	when it comes about the lifestyle opposed to doing that daily grind to pay for a house that you don't get to enjoy
YOU1000000153_S0000129	which we thoroughly do enjoy
YOU1000000153_S0000130	yes absolutely i think living in this home it's taught us something that we maybe didn't expect i guess i'll transition to a tiny living was
YOU1000000153_S0000132	born from a more tragic time in our life you know the passing of of my father and everything that caused us to to question how we were living life and what direction we were going you know we didn't want to
YOU1000000153_S0000133	sit back in a fifty years time and realize that we had a waste of time with our family and loved ones and you know gone through the daily grind and had enjoyed life so it's really it's been an opening experience
YOU1000000153_S0000134	it generally comes down to time like the experience of being in this house it comes down to how much time we have now we have time together we have time to just be in
YOU1000000153_S0000135	a sense where we're not worried about the the hustle and bustle of daily life where where we relax together we're able to problem solved together where we just be together and i think
YOU1000000153_S0000136	make the most of every day
YOU1000000153_S0000137	yeah
YOU1000000153_S0000138	not promised tomorrow so you gotta look for the now

YOU1000000153_S0000143	one that offers them more financial freedom more connection with nature greater connection with one another and things that are truly innately important to them in life and really that is such a beautiful thing
YOU1000000154_S0000001	let's go
YOU1000000154_S0000003	today we are going to do something new we are at western avenue in brentwood and we are going to talk about philips new project from colossal properties
YOU1000000154_S0000005	so what i thought this thing is going to touch this three sixty character and then effectively that means that i'm not holding it and walking through the property you can basically just control it as it of some one looking at the v r or looking at them in facebook
YOU1000000154_S0000006	this is it there walking through the house we're gonna see as it a test
YOU1000000154_S0000008	okay philips these look pretty incredible
YOU1000000154_S0000009	yeah it's also about two weeks out
YOU1000000154_S0000010	two weeks out i can bet you all of that cause it is looking like them a lot further on
YOU1000000154_S0000012	yeah this one is in the coefficient phase
YOU1000000154_S0000013	i mean someone's gonna walk in here and effectively kind of get taking it all by
YOU1000000154_S0000015	work looks like you got something hiding up there which will lost your back yeah but let's go to
YOU1000000154_S0000017	this is a two year project
YOU1000000154_S0000019	so broke around two years ago
YOU1000000154_S0000020	yeah
YOU1000000154_S0000021	that's very different in this
YOU1000000154_S0000023	yeah clipping would be much much quicker
YOU1000000154_S0000025	six months are the fast generally i turn them around two or three maybe four month if you are on it every single day it goes quick but these things because of the scale they just take time
YOU1000000154_S0000027	so let's go explore it let's have a look and ah and so it was in such really in depth impression about
YOU1000000154_S0000029	definitely i'm gonna tell you to see this they look and tell me and how much they stole away
YOU1000000154_S0000030	this is a six hundred pound door
YOU1000000154_S0000032	in order to get
YOU1000000154_S0000034	that's not the way of a
YOU1000000154_S0000036	it's not a couple screws holding it in place people it takes a lot of work to get it to play
YOU1000000154_S0000038	floating stair case cable rails
YOU1000000154_S0000039	knew that's really awesome because if you are like that area onto the stairs is always such under utilize like area it's actually kind of creative
YOU1000000154_S0000041	yeah we will show piece
YOU1000000154_S0000043	like frame these staircase is coming up

YOU1000000154_S0000061	same thing with the fridge the panel
YOU1000000154_S0000063	are you finding that it's a general thing that people need to move one fridge
YOU1000000154_S0000065	i think you need it yeah i think you need it you gotta store all your you know fresh coconut juices

YOU1000000154_S0000074	they better like eating food
YOU1000000154_S0000075	but
YOU1000000154_S0000077	yeah we're gonna put in the action because all glass on this side we put in the ceiling so
YOU1000000154_S0000079	since we didn't have a real t v wall
YOU1000000154_S0000081	and so we'll have the sixty-five inch t v there mounted
YOU1000000154_S0000083	sitting there enjoying nature in the creek and you get a little bit like oh you know what is game on
YOU1000000154_S0000084	yeah
YOU1000000154_S0000085	you got so sick in the same scene put your button and the t v appears in front of you
YOU1000000154_S0000087	alright let's go and see this ah balcony looking down to the creek right here
YOU1000000154_S0000089	so fire pit we know that you are a big fan of fire pits and they are every single of your properties i remember
YOU1000000154_S0000091	this was an ethanol fire pit yes this is ethanol
YOU1000000154_S0000093	fire pit we do have a gas one on the lower level but this one is ethanol
YOU1000000154_S0000094	so is that becoming a bigger trend you think
YOU1000000154_S0000096	couple different of varieties of fire features in the house
YOU1000000154_S0000099	okay cool and then looking at these i'm in love with these railings right here i feel like when we're going see luxury development properties right now it's glass glass glass
YOU1000000154_S0000100	yes
YOU1000000154_S0000101	and like you've told me
YOU1000000154_S0000102	yeah and they don't look the greatest once house start aging right versus these i feel like have much longer life spend looking good while they are serving a purpose
YOU1000000154_S0000104	yeah
YOU1000000154_S0000105	so what was the reason you ended up going for this direction
YOU1000000154_S0000107	well actually this was the architects ah selection
YOU1000000154_S0000108	okay
YOU1000000154_S0000109	the architect david hertz he's ah based at venice
YOU1000000154_S0000110	which we we know his name but if you guys out there do not know david hertz go and look up malibu what is it technically called the house
YOU1000000154_S0000111	i think the airplane
YOU1000000154_S0000112	airplane house
YOU1000000154_S0000114	yeah this seven forty seven jumble jet wings used as a roof
YOU1000000154_S0000115	that yeah and so yeah look that up guys because it's the same guy that designed that that has brought his design field
YOU1000000154_S0000116	and he likes to in integrate some industrial elements into modern designs that's why you see like the steel railing on the cable rail likes to bring in some of the industrial
YOU1000000154_S0000118	and since we're up here can we talk about this beautiful cladding you have on
YOU1000000154_S0000119	oh yeah absolutely
YOU1000000154_S0000120	which you can actually see you guys like half way through
YOU1000000154_S0000122	putting on a sealer ah oil based sealer so this is cedar wood and it's been ah tongue and groove milled again that's a selection from david hertz
YOU1000000154_S0000123	yeah
YOU1000000154_S0000124	ah who likes to use no only some industrial elements like disraeli but natural elements that you know recyclable and organic
YOU1000000154_S0000126	but these these
YOU1000000154_S0000128	this is an area i'll always
YOU1000000154_S0000130	who got some look corridor leading who will spend time here why got to matter about light
YOU1000000154_S0000131	right
YOU1000000154_S0000132	it makes so much
YOU1000000154_S0000134	up on these floor top of the property what we got up there
YOU1000000154_S0000135	so up here we have four bedrooms and then plus an office
YOU1000000154_S0000136	so you are not saying office is a bedroom like a lock in
YOU1000000154_S0000137	extra extra
YOU1000000154_S0000138	i like that
YOU1000000154_S0000140	three guest bedrooms
YOU1000000154_S0000141	good guest bedrooms so this is better we know
YOU1000000154_S0000143	hey this is the worth
YOU1000000154_S0000144	this is the worthiest
YOU1000000154_S0000145	it's spend i mean it's weird than my grand bedroom
YOU1000000154_S0000146	or my own bedroom in my apartment
YOU1000000154_S0000147	yes
YOU1000000154_S0000149	i'm this not normal i'm actually again architecture you go one two three four different aspects
YOU1000000154_S0000151	different eye windows there store is
YOU1000000154_S0000153	and so is this help playing again with what
YOU1000000154_S0000155	so this staff core you see all the cook roof designs start feeling that in this phase
YOU1000000154_S0000156	okay
YOU1000000154_S0000157	okay so here we are in the master
YOU1000000154_S0000158	we are in the master
YOU1000000154_S0000159	and again your thing with stone is gone to another level with this architect where actually you put ah increasingly piece of stone work
YOU1000000154_S0000160	but it was a matching the light and the scene in there
YOU1000000154_S0000161	absolutely this is white marble and we ah set it up here in the fire place matching the ceiling design
YOU1000000154_S0000162	and double pocket doors on the exterior which is really difficult to do because the exterior doors have be waterproof and get them to sit right inside the door
YOU1000000154_S0000163	and also did blackout shades
YOU1000000154_S0000164	for all these windows in this room which again was a challenge because look at these the design of the windows and then up here clear story and there actually a pockets
YOU1000000154_S0000165	they were verse roll up in order block out the light coming in
YOU1000000154_S0000166	and philip tell us about this book magic i mean the stone looks beautiful here but i know it wasn't easy
YOU1000000154_S0000168	this labs individual the book matching with this main coming here and white marble are extreme heavy
YOU1000000154_S0000169	so and yeah it kind of get this sort of organic feel it's pretty cool
YOU1000000154_S0000170	and then all the windows basically leads to this beautiful balcony you have the same style of railing and you have this it makes all i see is green tree
YOU1000000154_S0000171	i know
YOU1000000154_S0000172	that's insane
YOU1000000154_S0000173	yeah
YOU1000000154_S0000174	so so nice it feels like you are not in the city
YOU1000000154_S0000175	you really get a good respected of the ah lamp if you come up here as well
YOU1000000154_S0000176	this you always hide the architect to create light streams took these plant
YOU1000000154_S0000177	so yeah this is like an exterior skylight out here
YOU1000000154_S0000178	it is so cool and this is the architect style that light
YOU1000000154_S0000179	architect yeah so this way you get a balcony over handing but you also get some additional sunlight coming in
YOU1000000154_S0000180	and just such a beautiful details that ties everything together
YOU1000000154_S0000181	so i just walked in the natures bathroom and i'll be i've just seen details everywhere and i've seen this cut them beautiful
YOU1000000154_S0000183	so bill tell us what it takes in get a piece like this in here
YOU1000000154_S0000184	right so we call this a integrated sink which means we take stone in this case a sea stone of course and we build the sink out of the actually stone
YOU1000000154_S0000185	works for scenes and you also have the sinks build with the same material right
YOU1000000154_S0000186	here that's building with the same thing a carbon tree underneath the drawers
YOU1000000154_S0000187	it's look so simple of here but getting all these details right get in all corners edges everything level it's tremendous in hour
YOU1000000154_S0000188	and there were a big mirror next to wall after we solve that
YOU1000000154_S0000189	yeah let's talk about this shower let's talk about this

YOU1000000155_S0000000	real estate investing rules of thumb the two percent rule the fifty percent rule and the seventy percent rule
YOU1000000155_S0000001	there are some rules of thumb that can help investors quickly scream through deals to make a good educated guess on whether not to pursue them
YOU1000000155_S0000002	now this is important notice that i didn't say there are some rules of thumb that help investors make purchase decisions
YOU1000000155_S0000003	because rules of thumb are not meant to be hard and fast rules they simply help an investor get a quick and dirty opinion on some valuable metrics
YOU1000000155_S0000004	always do a proper analysis but regardless these rules of thumb can come in really handy in saving you from analyzing every single deal that you've come across
YOU1000000155_S0000005	my name is brenton turner and in this video i've outlined several of the most common real estate map rules of thumb
YOU1000000155_S0000006	so you can begin practicing them in your own analysis of properties
YOU1000000155_S0000008	first the two percent rule also known as the one percent rule or the two percent test
YOU1000000155_S0000009	perhaps one of the most common rules of thumb used by rental property investors is known as the two percent rule
YOU1000000155_S0000010	but not because it's a rule so i say two percent test i like that better
YOU1000000155_S0000011	essentially this rule of thumb looks at the monthly rent divided by the value of the property in a percentage form
YOU1000000155_S0000012	for those who just got confused let's make this super simple if a property rents for two thousand dollars a month
YOU1000000155_S0000013	and the value is two hundred thousand dollars and in two thousand divided by two hundred thousand equals one percent
YOU1000000155_S0000014	in this example the property does not pass the two percent test but it doesn't meet the one percent test exactly
YOU1000000155_S0000015	or what if the property it rents for fifteen hundred hundred a month and it costs a hundred and eighty thousand to buy well fifteen hundred divided by a hundred eight thousand is point eight percent
YOU1000000155_S0000016	that's definitely short of the one percent rule or one percent test now what if that property rents for fifteen hundred a month but it's worth a hundred and twenty thousand
YOU1000000155_S0000017	well fifteen hundred divided by a hundred twenty thousand equals one point two five percent all right so you get how that works now right but what does it mean
YOU1000000155_S0000018	well essentially the one percent or two percent test gives us a quick and dirty view on whether or not the property will produce positive cash flow
YOU1000000155_S0000019	and of course just a rule of thumb it isn't always precise but generally speaking the higher the percentage the better the cash flow
YOU1000000155_S0000020	this is also greatly depends on location price and how much the expenses truly are on the property
YOU1000000155_S0000021	but the rule of thumb can help an investor make some decisions on whether or not to pursue a certain property
YOU1000000155_S0000022	for example i know that most properties that fall short of one percent will likely never produce a positive cash flow for me
YOU1000000155_S0000023	if it's one and two percent it probably will and if it's above two percent which is really hard to find today then i'm almost positive that it will
YOU1000000155_S0000024	so if my real estate agent tells me that they have a perfect rental house for me to buy and i see that the purchase price is a hundred and twenty-five thousand
YOU1000000155_S0000025	and i find that old rent for a thousand dollars a month i can make a very quick decision and i know that most likely ideal ain't gonna ever provide cash flow
YOU1000000155_S0000026	because it falls short of the one percent rule because a thousand divided by a hundred twenty-five equals point eight percent
YOU1000000155_S0000027	in a case like this i probably wouldn't spend any more time looking at the deal if i was only interested in the cash flow
YOU1000000155_S0000028	so that's the value of the two percent rule test thing while the two percent rule and the one percent rule or test we just mentioned
YOU1000000155_S0000029	they can help you get with a like go no go decision on looking further into a rental property
YOU1000000155_S0000030	it doesn't really tell us how much cash flow we might expect for that investors often rely on the fifty percent rule of thumb
YOU1000000155_S0000031	the fifty percent rule states that on average and over time half of the income in a property is spent on operating expenses
YOU1000000155_S0000032	now what our operating expenses well good question operating expenses are all of the expenses involved with running a rental property
YOU1000000155_S0000033	except the loan payment so it includes taxes insurance utilities repairs vacancy and other metrics
YOU1000000155_S0000034	that leave the landlord's checking account every single month or every year depends on how you want to look at it
YOU1000000155_S0000035	the fifty percent rule can help an investor quickly estimate the cash flow of a rental property because it combines all of those expenses except for the loan into one easy number
YOU1000000155_S0000037	so let's work through this imagine a property rents for two thousand dollars a month the fifty percent says half of this a thousand will be spent on expenses
YOU1000000155_S0000038	this means we're left with a thousand bucks but now we need to make the mortgage payment on this right unless you paid cash for the property but let's say you didn't
YOU1000000155_S0000039	so with that thousand dollars we have left let's say the mortgage is six hundred dollars so how much do you have left four hundred bucks
YOU1000000155_S0000040	because two thousand times fifty percent equals a thousand a thousand minus six hundred for operating expenses is four hundred dollars in cash flow
YOU1000000155_S0000041	that remaining number is what you can estimate over time on average you might get in monthly cash flow
YOU1000000155_S0000042	of course that fifty percent estimate on operating expenses can really vary wildly depending on the property
YOU1000000155_S0000043	in some areas taxes and insurance might be incredibly high but in other areas that might be much lower some properties require that the landlord pay all the utilities
YOU1000000155_S0000044	where other properties allow the tenant to pay their own and while inherent weaknesses do exist
YOU1000000155_S0000045	the fifty percent rule does have value i mean when you are looking at a property that rents for twelve hundred bucks a month
YOU1000000155_S0000047	and you know the mortgage payment would be around a thousand you can pretty much guarantee that property will not produce a positive cash flow
YOU1000000155_S0000048	because two hundred bucks a month is not a lot of room for all those expenses because twelve hundred times fifty percent equals six hundred
YOU1000000155_S0000049	six hundred minus a thousand is negative four hundred right now the fifty percent rule helps keep real estate investors in check
YOU1000000155_S0000050	and to remind us that there are a lot of expenses that over time add up yeah i mean a new roof is only needed every twenty years
YOU1000000155_S0000051	but if you divide a ten thousand dollars roof into two hundred forty months that roof is actually costing you forty-two bucks a month every single month
YOU1000000155_S0000052	these operating expenses add up over time and as most investors have seen they tend to settle around fifty percent giving a long enough time frame
YOU1000000155_S0000053	okay on to the final rule of thumb today the seventy percent rule
YOU1000000155_S0000054	the last couple of rules of thumb that we talked about we're designed to help rental property owners but what about the house flippers the wholesalers i don't want to leave you guys out
YOU1000000155_S0000055	so for those who are flipping houses the seventy percent rule can be helpful in determining just how much to pay for a property
YOU1000000155_S0000056	the seventy percent rule states that the most you should pay for a potential flip is seventy percent of the after repair value like what it would sell for when it was all fixed up
YOU1000000155_S0000057	minus the repair cost so example if a hole would sell for three hundred grand all fixed up and the property needed fifty grand worth of work to get there
YOU1000000155_S0000058	then three hundred thousand times seventy percent is two hundred ten thousand subtract out that fifty thousand dollar and you're left with one hundred sixty k
YOU1000000155_S0000059	according to the seventy percent rule the most someone should pay for that property would be a hundred sixty k but of course there are problems with the seventy percent rule
YOU1000000155_S0000060	this rule of thumb assumes that thirty percent of the a r v the after repair value is going to be spent on holding costs on closing costs on the buying side the selling side
YOU1000000155_S0000061	commissions taxes attorney fees title company fees and more and the flippers profit and any other charges that come up during the deal now this works well in some markets
YOU1000000155_S0000062	but it has some severe limitations
YOU1000000155_S0000063	for example the seventy percent rule doesn't really work that well for a property with a really low a r v after a pair of values
YOU1000000155_S0000064	such as fifty thousand dollars as mentioned earlier the thirty percent deducted from the a r v includes the holding cost and the closing cost as well as a profit
YOU1000000155_S0000065	the investor or the flipper wants to make however like thirty percent of fifty grand is like fifteen thousand dollar so following the seventy percent rule
YOU1000000155_S0000066	all of the fees cost and profit would only be fifteen grand
YOU1000000155_S0000067	if the fees and holding costs were to total like ten grand that would leave just five thousand dollar in profit for the house flipper
YOU1000000155_S0000068	and i don't know any house flipper who's gonna take on the risk of flipping a house for just five grand
YOU1000000155_S0000069	so following the seventy percent rule a flipper or wholesaler would pay far too much for the property in this example
YOU1000000155_S0000070	an investor flipping houses at this level might require far less than seventy percent maybe a fifty percent or even lower
YOU1000000155_S0000071	now a similar problem exists with the seventy percent rule for more expensive properties
YOU1000000155_S0000072	the seventy percent rule would dictate that a home with an a r v of seven hundred grand that needs fifty grand at work
YOU1000000155_S0000073	should produce a maximum offer of four hundred and forty thousand
YOU1000000155_S0000074	but in most markets finding a seven hundred dollar property for four hundred and forty thousand is simply not feasible
YOU1000000155_S0000075	a person who sticks exclusively to that seventy percent rule are likely never gonna find a good enough deal to ever flip in a single property in that market
YOU1000000155_S0000076	in this case eight percent or even eight-five percent might be good enough
YOU1000000155_S0000077	furthermore some investors may spend more or less on fees and costs because of their particular life situation or location
YOU1000000155_S0000078	for example in some states purchasing a home may require three grand in closing costs while in other states it might be six thousand dollars
YOU1000000155_S0000079	some investors may have a real estate license which saves them tens of thousands of dollars in commissions
YOU1000000155_S0000080	whereas other investors well they may need to pay commissions when they actually sell the property so how should the seventy percent rule be valued
YOU1000000155_S0000081	well carefully it's a quick and dirty way to guesstimate the approximate amount you should pay for a property
YOU1000000155_S0000082	but as with all rules of thumb no concrete decisions should be made unless you've run a real estate analysis on the property
YOU1000000155_S0000083	and of course if you want to do that check out the bigger pockets a suite of calculators you can get them at biggerpockets dot com forward slash calc c a l c

YOU1000000157_S0000024	yes sir i've been there fifteen years
YOU1000000157_S0000026	hold on for a minute police could hear the music from outside and they issued ah issued you a two hundred dollar fine
YOU1000000157_S0000027	so what do you want to tell me about this
YOU1000000157_S0000028	well i've been there fifteen years no problem we got new neighbors that moved in and they called the cops on me they could've knocked on the door i would've turned the music down
YOU1000000157_S0000030	was it a radio or what was it
YOU1000000157_S0000031	oh it was a radio
YOU1000000157_S0000032	radio
YOU1000000157_S0000033	you have the amplifiers
YOU1000000157_S0000034	yeah yes sir
YOU1000000157_S0000035	you have amplifiers
YOU1000000157_S0000036	yeah
YOU1000000157_S0000037	what time of day was it
YOU1000000157_S0000038	ah i think it was about eleven o'clock
YOU1000000157_S0000039	at night
YOU1000000157_S0000040	yes sir
YOU1000000157_S0000041	yeah
YOU1000000157_S0000043	mister crawford i have a summons before me
YOU1000000157_S0000045	that indicates that on april twenty-seventh that
YOU1000000157_S0000047	there was hard music coming from your residence
YOU1000000157_S0000048	it does not state
YOU1000000157_S0000050	the time
YOU1000000157_S0000052	so the summons is incomplete
YOU1000000157_S0000054	ah my philosophy is that everyone should be entitled
YOU1000000157_S0000056	to the full benefit of the law whether or not they're an experience attorney or not so if you came here with an attorney today an attorney would make a motion to dismiss
YOU1000000157_S0000057	because the summons is incomplete now you don't know that because you're not a lawyer but there's no reason why you shouldn't have the benefit of having to law enforced on your behalf
YOU1000000157_S0000058	but i know that and it will be immoral if i fine you when a summons is incomplete so i'm gonna dismiss it
YOU1000000157_S0000059	thank you your honor
YOU1000000157_S0000060	with the promise from you that keep the music down right
YOU1000000157_S0000061	okay
YOU1000000157_S0000062	what were you doing were you dancing with your girlfriend what was going on

YOU1000000157_S0000065	i just turned the music up i mean i didn't realize
YOU1000000157_S0000066	let me see your best move let me see your best move
YOU1000000157_S0000067	give him the great street slide
YOU1000000157_S0000069	there you go
YOU1000000157_S0000071	thank you your honor

YOU1000000157_S0000078	by pleading not guilty what you're saying is you want to come back and have a trial
YOU1000000157_S0000079	no okay then i don't plead not guilty can you look at my summons
YOU1000000157_S0000080	yeah look at her summons
YOU1000000157_S0000081	basically what i believe i explained ah is faulty
YOU1000000157_S0000082	caroline i don't hear a word you're saying unless you speak
YOU1000000157_S0000083	based on what i believe i heard you say earlier it's a faulty summons
YOU1000000157_S0000084	really
YOU1000000157_S0000085	well maybe i didn't understand
YOU1000000157_S0000086	explain that to me
YOU1000000157_S0000087	because the because
YOU1000000157_S0000089	um
YOU1000000157_S0000091	um
YOU1000000157_S0000092	the speed i was supposed to be driving at is not posted

YOU1000000157_S0000096	i was listening
YOU1000000157_S0000098	so every single word i said and you said i wonder if any of this applies to me
YOU1000000157_S0000099	um no i still believe in my innocence before that
YOU1000000157_S0000100	well tell me about it
YOU1000000157_S0000101	um well i came back and went to the school and recreated the scene and took film at night
YOU1000000157_S0000102	and i used to be a school teacher and ah it's very very hard to see the speed limit um at that location ah there's there's no speed limit in front of the school so
YOU1000000157_S0000103	that's why i'm here because i believe that there should be more signs
YOU1000000157_S0000105	well the first thing you don't want to do is start lecturing the judge
YOU1000000157_S0000106	i'm sorry
YOU1000000157_S0000107	and what should be done because some judges get very upset
YOU1000000157_S0000108	no it's not your job to do that anyway
YOU1000000157_S0000109	oh good okay it's not my job
YOU1000000157_S0000110	no
YOU1000000157_S0000112	be careful he's a tough guy
YOU1000000157_S0000114	okay
YOU1000000157_S0000115	he's on the swat team
YOU1000000157_S0000116	first guys out there with the big guns
YOU1000000157_S0000117	no just concerned about the kids
YOU1000000157_S0000118	oh i see
YOU1000000157_S0000120	let me explain to you what's going on to everybody else
YOU1000000157_S0000122	they they just began this system and the first wave of some of this that went out there were a whole bunch of them
YOU1000000157_S0000123	that did not indicate the speed limit in the small blocks where the print is big
YOU1000000157_S0000125	and they indicated the speed limit up at the top of the summons you can't see it you need you literally need a magnifying glass to see it
YOU1000000157_S0000127	so i have taken the position that the summons was inadequate for the city to prevail there's such a disparity between the power of the individual and the power of the sovereign that they should get it right the first time
YOU1000000157_S0000128	i think that
YOU1000000157_S0000129	thank you
YOU1000000157_S0000130	unless it's a crime of moral turpitude then i think there are other factors involved but these these are speeding tickets
YOU1000000157_S0000131	i'm not condoning speeding but i think everybody should be afforded all their be afforded all their constitutional rights
YOU1000000157_S0000132	thank you
YOU1000000157_S0000133	even though

YOU1000000157_S0000149	thank you so much

YOU1000000159_S0000001	twenty twenty has been a year but thankfully it was a pretty great year for video games i g n scored more games as masterpieces than any other year for more than two decades
YOU1000000159_S0000002	though of course it wasn't all tens and gold stars we also rated more games in one year at a three or lower that's awful or worse than we have in a while
YOU1000000159_S0000003	so without further ado here are i g n's best and worst reviewed games of twenty twenty
YOU1000000159_S0000005	crusader kings three is a superb strategy game a great r p g and a master class on how to take the best parts of an existing system and make them deeper and better
YOU1000000159_S0000006	i have thousands of hours in the previous game and i expect to spend at least that many in this third installment
YOU1000000159_S0000007	all of the engrossingly flawed characters and stories of love war triumph and loss that have already dynamically emerged from my play-throughs feel like just the beginning of something legendary
YOU1000000159_S0000008	in fact if i had to pick only one game to play for the rest of my life the decision wouldn't be that difficult
YOU1000000159_S0000009	a new king of historical strategy has been crowned long live the king
YOU1000000159_S0000011	back when v r first became a real thing and we all start spitballing about which game worlds we'd most like to be fully immersed in half-life topped my list tied with bioshock
YOU1000000159_S0000012	it took a few years but half-life alyx has realized that potential and it's the best v r shooter i've ever play
YOU1000000159_S0000013	with it valve has set a new bar for v r interactivity detail and level design showing what can happen when a world class developer goes all in on the new frontier of technology
YOU1000000159_S0000014	in a lot of ways it feels like a game from the future and one that the rest of v r gaming will likely take a good long while to match much less surpass
YOU1000000159_S0000016	the last of us part two is a masterpiece worthy of its predecessor taking strides forward in nearly every way
YOU1000000159_S0000017	ellie steps into the spotlight and carries the sequel in a manner that feels like the culmination of everything that's made naughty dog's blockbuster storytelling so memory
YOU1000000159_S0000019	it delivers a layered emotionally shattering story on top of stealth in action gameplay that improved the first game's mechanics while integrating a bit more of uncharted's greater mobility in action
YOU1000000159_S0000020	but while part two is a thrilling adventure it still makes time for a stunning nuanced exploration of the strength and fragility of the human spirit
YOU1000000159_S0000021	the playstation four has one of its finest exclusive in one of the generations best games
YOU1000000159_S0000023	microsoft flight simulator is legitimately incredible it's difficult to fully describe how amazing it feels to jump into a plane and just fly to and from literally any place in the entire world
YOU1000000159_S0000024	the base games twenty included aircraft feel like more than enough for even hardcore aviation enthusiasts
YOU1000000159_S0000025	and the ability to tailor the experience to whatever skill level you desire makes it suitable for anyone looking to fly the friendly skies from the comfort of their homes
YOU1000000159_S0000026	the real world mapping data however takes flight simulator for being just an impressive game to the most
YOU1000000159_S0000028	and limitless simulation i've ever experienced in spite of its
YOU1000000159_S0000030	seeing famous landmarks landing at the world's most recognizable airports or just touching down in a remote landing strip in south america is mind-boggling cool
YOU1000000159_S0000031	and absolutely unparalleled way to virtually explore our world
YOU1000000159_S0000033	overwatch is a one of a kind hero shooter that is far and away the best of its genre it offers a variety depth and style that very few come close to matching
YOU1000000159_S0000034	its four-year-old foundation has been lovingly crafted into the unparalleled multiplayer experience that offers today from its now cherished characters expertly crafted maps
YOU1000000159_S0000035	an outstanding sound design is a masterpiece of competitive gameplay most importantly of all though it's never stopped being ridiculously fun after all these years
YOU1000000159_S0000036	all of these factors combine to make overwatch a singularly special shooter and one that i would recommend to anyone without hesitation
YOU1000000159_S0000038	persona five was already a strong front-runner for being the best j r p g ever made and royal really gets me wondering what else could even compete
YOU1000000159_S0000039	the excellent story and it's lovable multi-dimensional characters along with the challenging tactical combat are all refined and back for another round with new surprises and new friends until
YOU1000000159_S0000040	there are new areas to explore and new twists to leave your jaw on the floor very little has been left untouched and just about everything that has been touched is better off for it
YOU1000000159_S0000041	the phantom thieves have stolen my heart all over again and i don't really want it back
YOU1000000159_S0000042	i wasn't sure what i wanted to have a sequel of spelunky given how high the pedestal i keep the original game on how do you improve upon a game like that
YOU1000000159_S0000043	but most mouth took its time and managed to deliver a masterpiece that improves upon its predecessor in ways i never would have even imagined
YOU1000000159_S0000044	spelunky two takes everything that made the original great and expands upon each of those individual aspects without ever over complicating the elegant retro simplicity of its two d platform
YOU1000000159_S0000045	the possibilities for interactions between yourself your enemies and the environment are virtually limitless
YOU1000000159_S0000046	which is a part of what makes every new run in spelunky two so unpredictable and exciting it doesn't do much to win over the people who already weren't fans of the originals unforgiving difficulty but as someone who is more than two hundred runs in
YOU1000000159_S0000048	and feels like he's only scratched the surface spelunky two is a game that i see myself playing for a long long time
YOU1000000159_S0000050	man those were great of course there is no alpha without the omega so
YOU1000000159_S0000051	cooking mama cookstar is bogged down by monotony poor motion controls and nightmarish voice acting also having practically nothing new to offer
YOU1000000159_S0000052	whether it's the lack of consequences for failure incessantly obnoxious mama the bland cooking mini games the lackluster multiplayer modes or the complete absence of meaningful progression
YOU1000000159_S0000053	cooking mama cookstar is a tedious game that does almost nothing well
YOU1000000159_S0000054	going into final fantasy crystal chronicles remastered edition we expected a fair amount of old school design and were surprised to find that the story had been altered
YOU1000000159_S0000055	but we never anticipated it would be in such a frustratingly poor technical state on playstation four
YOU1000000159_S0000056	unacceptable load times lack of local co-op and an arcane matchmaking system makes playing final fantasy crystal chronicles a chore
YOU1000000159_S0000057	a few simple quality of life improvements even if it was just the removal or shortening of load times would have gone a long way to gloss over at least some of crystal chronicles shortcomings when compared to many other dungeon crawlers you can play in twenty twenty
YOU1000000159_S0000058	unfortunately the old school frustrations that weren't addressed only serves to date everything else about it almost completely depriving it of any sort of fun
YOU1000000159_S0000059	we'll be installing it as soon as possible and never looking back
YOU1000000159_S0000061	aside from up to date squads this season's kiss and a new start screen fifa twenty-one on switches virtually unchanged from fifa twenty
YOU1000000159_S0000062	which was virtually unchanged from fifa nineteen before it and outrageously priced of forty-nine ninety-nine dollars or forty-four ninety-nine pounds if last year's release was borderline insulting
YOU1000000159_S0000063	this year's is just plain disgraceful ea please do better
YOU1000000159_S0000065	but no circumstances should you play waking if you want guided meditation there's plenty of free apps for phones and videos on youtube
YOU1000000159_S0000066	if you want to play a souls like this plenty out there including actual souls games if you need a game with psychic powers control is a lot of fun
YOU1000000159_S0000067	avoid this at all costs and do almost literally anything else with your time
YOU1000000159_S0000069	yeah we're gonna try our best to forget about those for more good games though be should check out all our picks for the best games of twenty twenty or if you want to look ahead have a look at all the big games slated for release in twenty twenty-one
YOU1000000159_S0000070	for more on gaming is good bad and everything in between you're already in the right place here at i g n
YOU1000000160_S0000000	the console wars are entering a whole new era in twenty-twenty as we move on to the next generation of gaming at a massive tech giant enters the picture
YOU1000000160_S0000001	but as a gamer what new console do you choose or do you pick them all
YOU1000000160_S0000002	well we made the choice even easier for you today as we picked the p s five up against the x box two and the google stadia in the ultimate battle of console domination
YOU1000000160_S0000003	this isn't just about brand loyalty as we break down gaming choices features graphics and online interaction to determine the ultimate winner
YOU1000000160_S0000005	graphics comparisons four k graphics are the new standard in gaming and this is the bare minimum that will be supplied by all three consoles
YOU1000000160_S0000006	the one caviar internet speed playing a detail rich game like a assassin's creed origins could look very different at one home using stadia compare to another
YOU1000000160_S0000007	the google stadia uses variable graphic performance based solely on internet speed
YOU1000000160_S0000008	so if your parents are binge watching netflix while your little sister jams out to spotify you could easily find yourself playing a game at seven-twenty p with stereo sounding instead of being maxed out at four-k graphics with h d r video and five point one surround sound
YOU1000000160_S0000009	the p s five and x box two were rely on disks and downloads to provide a consistent quality for a lot of the games
YOU1000000160_S0000010	besides the four-k quality each of the three consoles also aim to provide sixty frames per second as a standard for the majority of the games
YOU1000000160_S0000011	in simple terms character movements are going to look incredibly smooth things like car races are going to be fluid and all those first person shooters will be even better than you could imagine
YOU1000000160_S0000012	another way these console are all improving on the graphical presentation with ray tracing
YOU1000000160_S0000013	the lighting technique includes extremely vivid graphics and will make everything from reflection to shadows look even more realistic than they already are
YOU1000000160_S0000014	all and all each console is pretty much on power with each other in the graphics department with the p s five and x box two taking a slight edge because of stadia's reliance on proper internet speed
YOU1000000160_S0000015	the controllers what are good graphics without a good controller to enjoy those games with the p s five and x box two both have a history of controllers their gamers are used to
YOU1000000160_S0000016	while you can't expect more of the same from the x box with their pro controllers somebody is making vast improvements for their next entry in the dual shot controller
YOU1000000160_S0000017	one of the biggest feature is a major upgrade in the rumble technology in the adaptive nature of the analog sticks
YOU1000000160_S0000018	no longer will the controller just play out of the random rumbler buzz while you play
YOU1000000160_S0000019	everything reacts to the surroundings you are in if you are an under cover agent who must climb their way through a snowy mountain side you'll feel the struggle of each footstep as you move the analog stick around
YOU1000000160_S0000020	driving a vehicle on a beach instead of the road you'll feel the difference as you travel through sand as opposed to the paved road
YOU1000000160_S0000021	on top of that the trigger buttons on top of the newest dual shot controller are more sensitive than ever
YOU1000000160_S0000022	blasting your way through levels of the laser gun will feel very different than playing as batman and throwing a better hand and the pressure you place on the trigger will indicate the speed in force rather than just a button matching
YOU1000000160_S0000023	google stadia isn't trying to reinvent the wheel with their controller either knowing what works the stadia controller features dual analog sticks the typical input buttons and multiple triggers on top
YOU1000000160_S0000024	if the dual shot controller works without any major problems or glitches than the p s five edges out the competition for the innovative nature of their design
YOU1000000160_S0000025	cloud game surfaces and speaking of cloud based gaming google stadia is not the only one provide the streaming service
YOU1000000160_S0000026	besides their typical game releases and digital downloads both sony and microsoft have their own subscription based streaming game services
YOU1000000160_S0000027	the x box game pass is priced at ten dollars a month the end features over one hundred games with their rotating title of options including console classics
YOU1000000160_S0000028	the ex cloud service microsoft runs on looks to expand the game pass to all types of i o s and android devices in the near future
YOU1000000160_S0000029	the playstation now service has an affordable option of players are willing to pay for a whole year upfront
YOU1000000160_S0000030	well the base price starts at nine-ninety-nine per month a whole year costs around sixty dollar which equals out to five dollar a month
YOU1000000160_S0000031	the p s five will be one of the best ways to enjoy the service with a huge library of past games from the p s two p s three and p s four all rolled in to one
YOU1000000160_S0000032	the cloud based service also includes p c gaming through the p s now app the pricing discounts give the playstation cloud streaming a huge plus
YOU1000000160_S0000033	but the x box game pass does have some exclusive rights to minecraft so there is that it is a little hard to compare stadia's options until the service fully rolls out but there will be a free plan
YOU1000000160_S0000034	allowing gamers to hop on any google device and play the pro plan will include a number of free monthly gaming options as well solid state hard drives
YOU1000000160_S0000035	the insides of both the x box two and p s five will show a major improvement with solid state hard drives
YOU1000000160_S0000036	the massive improvement was years in the making and the more affordable hard drives will be a game changer in many ways
YOU1000000160_S0000037	load times would be virtually not existed and the struggles of saving hard drive space will be gone as well with the solid state drive gamers don't need to download the whole game to play
YOU1000000160_S0000038	not interested in the single player campaign just download the multiplayer element of the game and be on your merry way
YOU1000000160_S0000039	not only will you be able to save hard drive space but the anticipation of playing a game will not take hours and hours
YOU1000000160_S0000040	on the google side of things even though the stadia platform will be available through the chromecast ultra and chrome books there are no downloads needed everything will be cloud based
YOU1000000160_S0000041	saving some hard drive space and reducing loading time as google's high speed service provide all the loading and space you need for a whole library of games
YOU1000000160_S0000043	game streams in today's gaming world does it even count that you have played a game if your epic skills or epic fails were not captured in some sort of game stream
YOU1000000160_S0000044	well that's pretty much the case and the live game streams focus has been an emphasis for all the next gen consoles
YOU1000000160_S0000045	microsoft is getting pretty serious about their online streaming platform mixer
YOU1000000160_S0000046	the newest competitor to twitch will be integrated directly in to the x box two making it easy for players to hop online and broadcast their live streams
YOU1000000160_S0000047	a picture in picture format also allows players to watch mixers streams while they play their own games plus ninja has joined the mixer party giving the whole surface a lot of legitimacy and fan fair
YOU1000000160_S0000048	i will be streaming exclusively on mixer
YOU1000000160_S0000049	sony does not have their own streaming service but twitch is readily available for the console and will likely make the same transition with the p s five
YOU1000000160_S0000050	meanwhile the power house of google has one of the most popular video streaming websites at its fingertips in the form of youtube
YOU1000000160_S0000051	but the capture button featured on the stadia controller players will easily be able to sort out content
YOU1000000160_S0000052	upload footage and create all types of stadia youtube content the youtube integration is huge for stadia but the x box mixer service may edge them all out
YOU1000000160_S0000053	ninja has garnered a ton of impress for his switch and by the time the x box two gets released the platform could've an even larger viewing audience
YOU1000000160_S0000054	online play with the cloud based games huge downloads and an emphasis on surfaces like x box live and playstation plus online gaming will be bigger than ever in the next generation of consoles
YOU1000000160_S0000055	and google has announced some pretty innovative changes that will helps at the stadia apart the first is the buddy pass sick of having a friend who doesn't have the online subscription you want to play with
YOU1000000160_S0000056	well just gift them one with the buddy pass anyone who signs up for stadia's founders package will be allowed to gift someone a buddy pass for three months
YOU1000000160_S0000057	and that player can reap all the benefits another feature that helps the stadia stand out above the rest the crowd play feature
YOU1000000160_S0000058	enjoying your favorite streamer in popular multiplayer game well the crowd play feature allows you to hop in on their actual game giving gamers a chance to play with some of their favorites
YOU1000000160_S0000059	for p s five and x box two expect more of the same not that it's a bad thing but google major changes could lead to some new innovations for both microsoft and sony
YOU1000000160_S0000060	give one to the new guy because google's online play definitely peaks a lot of interest enjoying the battle so far
YOU1000000160_S0000061	well be sure to check out our video ten worst gaming injuries when you're done
YOU1000000160_S0000062	free games who doesn't love free games well we are here to give you a break down of all the best free options for each of the next gen consoles
YOU1000000160_S0000063	google is on the short end of a stick here as they rely on players making full game purchases rather than offering a whole lot of free titles
YOU1000000160_S0000064	so far the only free game package with the stadia premium edition is destiny to the collection
YOU1000000160_S0000065	meanwhile you can expect both playstation plus and x box gold to continue rolling out their free game options
YOU1000000160_S0000066	the free games have been a huge highlight to paying the monthly subscriptions on both systems and removing the feature with likely resulting a lot less subscribers
YOU1000000160_S0000067	the free game feature is an ideal way for third party and independent publishers to showcase a variety of their games and gives players an easy way to build up their library
YOU1000000160_S0000068	google definitely has a lot of catching up to do in the free game department but the company is also working on publishing their own games
YOU1000000160_S0000069	so there could be some major changes and more access to games down the line
YOU1000000160_S0000070	backwards compatibility google is the little baby among the bunch unless they decide to connect the services like epic games or stream do not expect a huge back library of game download and backwards compatibility
YOU1000000160_S0000071	meanwhile microsoft and sony will continue to honor they're faithful making you want to dust off some disks in the long run
YOU1000000160_S0000072	sony will allow any p s four disk to work on the console giving players a lot of time to stack up on games over the next year
YOU1000000160_S0000073	meanwhile the x box two might as well be called the x box legacy because the console really blows all the others out of the park with its physical disk compatibility
YOU1000000160_S0000074	the console will be able to read every single x box game from the original console all the way up to the x box one
YOU1000000160_S0000075	this is a huge feature and will likely have us on e-bay snatching up old games we used to love
YOU1000000160_S0000076	needless to say but the x box two has the major advantage in this category other forms of media
YOU1000000160_S0000077	but we all love our hours and hours of gaming marathon consoles have become a lot more than just gaming machines so lets take a look at some of the extras
YOU1000000160_S0000078	anyone who purchases the stadia premium will get a chromecast ultra the h d m i device which offers streaming access to hundreds of different channels along with some live t v options like sling
YOU1000000160_S0000079	naturally both the x box and playstation will continue their wide range of streaming channels like netflix hulu and newer options like disney plus
YOU1000000160_S0000080	on the xbox side of things the exclusive anaphelps content will help drive in sports fans meanwhile sony continues to promote their live t v service playstation view
YOU1000000160_S0000081	the view is available on multiple devices making it an option for when the p s five is not in use
YOU1000000160_S0000082	expect the expansion of the view service on the p s five with the some possible added features and extra content
YOU1000000160_S0000083	not matter what type of video streams you enjoy all the consoles are pretty much equal in this category release dates
YOU1000000160_S0000084	okay now that we all know about the newest consoles it's pretty much raised to the finished line to see which one will get released first
YOU1000000160_S0000085	well google has a head start as the premium edition of stadia will roll out in november although there has been some major delays due to the pre-orders selling out across the globe
YOU1000000160_S0000086	the stadia is launching this year two-thousand and nineteen
YOU1000000160_S0000088	no matter when the various forms google stadia pre-orders do arrive it will be months in advance for the p s five and x box two
YOU1000000160_S0000089	the sony and microsoft consoles are set for a holiday twenty-twenty launch date giving google plenty of time to work out the kinks build up on the hype and allow stadia to become a household main
YOU1000000160_S0000090	the latest rumor points to the sony p s five getting released on december fourth twenty-twenty just in time to place a big old box under the christmas tree
YOU1000000160_S0000091	let's just say that christmas break twenty-twenty will be filled with a whole lot of games wow what a battle between some juggernauts
YOU1000000160_S0000092	the cloud service streaming definitely limits stadia's presence in the console wars but the ability to play on a pixel four also changes gaming forever
YOU1000000160_S0000093	microsoft and sony are sure making some major improvements but time will only tell when people finally get some hands on action with the consoles
YOU1000000160_S0000094	ether way we're all excited for the next generation of gaming
YOU1000000160_S0000095	and now it's your turn which console has impressed you the most so far what features are you looking forward to anything great we missed

YOU1000000161_S0000105	i do not like this detail
YOU1000000161_S0000106	it sounds like you're not a fan of the jump-man
YOU1000000161_S0000107	it's hard to look at these
YOU1000000161_S0000109	look at this
YOU1000000161_S0000111	the lacing opportunities
YOU1000000161_S0000112	lot of options i feel like it was in ah make-it-your-way era where everyone wanted to customize
YOU1000000161_S0000113	i think burger king led the way then have it your way they were telling everyone that they could have it their way
YOU1000000161_S0000115	and this piggy backed on it
YOU1000000161_S0000117	that's really not true do you think the pace of it is going okay
YOU1000000161_S0000118	i just feel like we're taking should we speed it up
YOU1000000161_S0000119	three minutes per shoe times eighteen that's fifty-four minutes we're looking at an hour-long video
YOU1000000161_S0000121	i feel like i didn't do that well
YOU1000000161_S0000122	things have obviously changed at this point i think the world is transitioning they want things to look more high-tech

YOU1000000161_S0000130	i feel like they've kind of tamed a little bit from the last one with the unusual color here but that's because

YOU1000000161_S0000161	things are getting better now we're back in the realm now woah
YOU1000000161_S0000163	you can't talk about the ten without talking about this sole talk about history you're wearing that on your feet
YOU1000000161_S0000164	ninety-two m v p championship ninety-three m v p championship ninety-four beyond
YOU1000000161_S0000165	we're now back in the realm of that number four
YOU1000000161_S0000166	i totally disagree i like that it's just ah a little ah bit of color kind of seeping
YOU1000000161_S0000167	yeah
YOU1000000161_S0000168	little blue teasing you on the rim and you just wanna get in there and see what's down there
YOU1000000161_S0000170	nothing else they're not too flashy
YOU1000000161_S0000171	no
YOU1000000161_S0000172	i think i know what's coming next because they're numbered and we just did ten
YOU1000000161_S0000174	this is a different unboxing experience look at this you could start to tell right away you get the little pause going on these are number eleven but they're not just any eleven
YOU1000000161_S0000175	check that out looney tunes we're talking about the space jam shoe look at the reflection there on that
YOU1000000161_S0000177	i love that
YOU1000000161_S0000178	if something's gonna get you fired up this has got to be it
YOU1000000161_S0000179	i'm so fired up right now
YOU1000000161_S0000180	something happened here
YOU1000000161_S0000181	this is the first carbon fiber
YOU1000000161_S0000183	i think this is the first sneaker in the group that i pulled out of the box and i feel like something happened
YOU1000000161_S0000184	i feel like i wanna just give you a moment with these
YOU1000000161_S0000185	let me have a moment
YOU1000000161_S0000187	you want any water while i'm up
YOU1000000161_S0000189	see when you talk about telling a story you talk about a shoe that's got ah something attached to it we said history earlier
YOU1000000161_S0000190	of course this one the year jordan went off to make space jam the whole baseball thing the number forty-five temporarily
YOU1000000161_S0000191	when you see this sneaker there's so much more that comes to mind
YOU1000000161_S0000193	no
YOU1000000161_S0000195	i didn't necessarily think i would have this type of emotional reaction to this particular shoe but it's happening right now
YOU1000000161_S0000197	the magic trick
YOU1000000161_S0000199	i had these shoes as a kid man that's something
YOU1000000161_S0000200	i love this pair
YOU1000000161_S0000201	wow
YOU1000000161_S0000203	that's a distinctive look without being overwhelming
YOU1000000161_S0000204	this comes together nicely
YOU1000000161_S0000205	you notice details but from a distance it's a package you see the complexities
YOU1000000161_S0000207	great contrast just like there
YOU1000000161_S0000209	low tops
YOU1000000161_S0000210	hmm
YOU1000000161_S0000211	not my favorite
YOU1000000161_S0000212	hmm looking at it on its own you can see the inside of the shoe on the other side
YOU1000000161_S0000213	that's what it looks like if your foot were in it
YOU1000000161_S0000214	that's actually that works
YOU1000000161_S0000216	rolls over easy this way but this way
YOU1000000161_S0000218	can't roll over
YOU1000000161_S0000219	i think if the jordan just tied to his career we still have one highlight left
YOU1000000161_S0000221	same model he wore for his last shot just a different colorway i love reliving that seeing him sync that shot unusual tongue
YOU1000000161_S0000222	maybe the weirdest tongue we've seen it certainly looks kind of like what they thought was futuristic at the time
YOU1000000161_S0000223	a jetson of shoes
YOU1000000161_S0000224	that's right
YOU1000000161_S0000225	like i robot
YOU1000000161_S0000226	uh-huh they're not my favorite yeah they're not my favorite
YOU1000000161_S0000227	i do like this pair
YOU1000000161_S0000229	what happened it's like i just said it's what happened
YOU1000000161_S0000231	this one i think it's now coming into its own
YOU1000000161_S0000232	for real sixteen this thing is removable right
YOU1000000161_S0000234	this is not that bad there's something happening with the this is not that bad
YOU1000000161_S0000236	i like these without the shroud
YOU1000000161_S0000237	yeah
YOU1000000161_S0000238	i worry that i'd trip over this or lose a
YOU1000000161_S0000239	seventeen
YOU1000000161_S0000241	hmm i don't know how to feel about these this to me feels more like a nike shoe that a jordan
YOU1000000161_S0000242	this one feels like a some kind of a dress shoe to me
YOU1000000161_S0000243	this stuff on the back yeah
YOU1000000161_S0000244	he like going from the court to the boardroom
YOU1000000161_S0000245	well said
YOU1000000161_S0000246	thank you
YOU1000000161_S0000247	i don't like this shoe actually this was the hardest one to find by the way this came from somebody's personal collection
YOU1000000161_S0000249	hardest to get open too
YOU1000000161_S0000250	no that's it that is the far it goes
YOU1000000161_S0000251	no
YOU1000000161_S0000252	yeah
YOU1000000161_S0000253	i can get it out further
YOU1000000161_S0000255	i'll do it later
YOU1000000161_S0000256	i don't even this is i don't even it's unfortunate
YOU1000000161_S0000257	um-um
YOU1000000161_S0000258	this is the end though
YOU1000000161_S0000259	maybe we wish he retired earlier to be honest
YOU1000000161_S0000260	this is the moment right now where we each select our favorite out of the bunch i mean we just unboxed eighteen different jordans here
YOU1000000161_S0000261	who better than us to tell you which is the best you go first
YOU1000000161_S0000262	okay michael jordan one it's the beginning i just love this shoe in an adult size
YOU1000000161_S0000263	it's a great shoe it's a classic look i see where you're coming from the funny thing about this entire experience has been the less desirable shoes have been the hardest to find
YOU1000000161_S0000264	the collecting part of it is only half the thing like some people want to wear this history
YOU1000000161_S0000265	for me there's something about this package right here which just screams of a very particular era
YOU1000000161_S0000266	this gives me positive vibes there's a confidence here this is iconic to me
YOU1000000161_S0000267	they all are in a way
YOU1000000161_S0000268	they all are in a way that's up there too out of the destruction of that time period this emerged
YOU1000000161_S0000269	i don't know about that
YOU1000000161_S0000271	so there you have it every game worn jordan unboxed here thanks to my friend brad hall
YOU1000000161_S0000272	thank you this is fun
YOU1000000162_S0000000	so i made that video recently about the apple air pods they came back into my life i've been using the air pods and kind of enjoying it
YOU1000000162_S0000002	they are widely successful you can see them out in the world other manufactures you know they're entering the space
YOU1000000162_S0000003	this isn't the latest incarnation of the fully wireless samsung earbud product
YOU1000000162_S0000004	it has couple of features that haven't been seen before why is my favorite one is the frankly is this in entire setup
YOU1000000162_S0000005	i can charge from any phone that supports wireless charge sharing because this is a samsung product and this is a samsung phone
YOU1000000162_S0000006	there's also some interplay that's bit smoother than it might otherwise be with a third party pair of earpods earpods
YOU1000000162_S0000007	but once you into the app this is where i think they have bit of an advantage over air pods they're super configurable
YOU1000000162_S0000008	here we can see the battery life of each individual unit you can use one independently of the other
YOU1000000162_S0000009	you can keep of these guys charging in a case while listening to the other one
YOU1000000162_S0000010	there are some equalizer settings here for base booze soft dynamic clear and so on
YOU1000000162_S0000011	you can manage how these things deal with the notifications and they do have touch pads on side unlike the air pods
YOU1000000162_S0000012	these have interchangeable ear tips and ear hooks as well look at all those options
YOU1000000162_S0000013	the air pods that you've seen it before doesn't fit that far into the ear canal for some people this fits really well others they won't stay in their ears
YOU1000000162_S0000014	these are on the other hand are gonna be a bit more predictable because they sit farther in ear canal and they have secondary rubber plastic component
YOU1000000162_S0000015	they should just be a bit more secure in there considering the way that they are designed
YOU1000000162_S0000016	air pod is a bit taller but also slightly less chunky than the galaxy bud
YOU1000000162_S0000017	so people wanna know hey which one should i get considering that you can use either on multiple platforms
YOU1000000162_S0000018	to work it's bluetooth headsets you can use the air pods on android you can use galaxy buds on ios
YOU1000000162_S0000019	within in the app there's also find my earbud button so that will track these down these could be pretty easy to lose i mean they are tiny
YOU1000000162_S0000020	also there is a pretty cool ambient sound option i can actually elevate the volume of the ambient sound and sound around me
YOU1000000162_S0000021	so it will be amplified into my ear so i can hear my surroundings while i am listening to music podcasts audiobook and so on
YOU1000000162_S0000022	now you can chuckle that all the way down so that it's muted you know what's going around me its muted
YOU1000000162_S0000023	you are gonna have ambient if you are on the bike you're cycling you could hear if if a car honks its horn or something this could really amplify your surroundings
YOU1000000162_S0000024	of course its not on the air pod has also the voice focus feature in there so this looks for voices specifically
YOU1000000162_S0000025	and allows them to cut through that particular frequency range i find this to be useful from time to time
YOU1000000162_S0000026	the other way that the touch pad works you can tap to play or pause a track double tap to play the next track answer or end a phone call
YOU1000000162_S0000027	triple tap to play the previous track and touch and hold to use a user configurable user's choice
YOU1000000162_S0000028	you can that launch specifically do something specifically and that user configurable and that's nice
YOU1000000162_S0000029	now that i have a quick ambient sound i am gonna touch and hold it to see if i can lighten up the surroundings here we go
YOU1000000162_S0000031	wow that's cool it toggles the ambient mode while you're holding your finger on the touch pad i mean ambient right now i can totally hear my conversation and hear my own voice do i look a little strange doing this quite possibly
YOU1000000162_S0000032	but the question you all have how did they stack up against the air pods now as you guys know i am an s ten user this is the device is currently in my pocket
YOU1000000162_S0000033	so effectiveness of these earbuds it has to be have to in correlation to this particular device
YOU1000000162_S0000034	we talked about some advantages with in the app who knows i might be willing to give up those extra features in exchange for potentially better sound i am not really sure
YOU1000000162_S0000035	start with the galaxy buds i wanna make sure i've got maximum volume okay so i know i've got a max volume for a sample
YOU1000000162_S0000036	one
YOU1000000162_S0000038	okay
YOU1000000162_S0000040	i were in soft right now dynamic clear base
YOU1000000162_S0000042	um
YOU1000000162_S0000044	okay i am wondering right now is it people who have been tested already had this in volume or not
YOU1000000162_S0000045	because i read some of things you read and that was the experience i was having until i make sure the buds himself were max volume and the phone was max volume
YOU1000000162_S0000046	now there's a lot more thump way more base are people doing it wrong
YOU1000000162_S0000048	its a headphone i'm hearing instrument i was gone for a minute it did trick sort of i've heard better kinda feel like i've to do this exact same track right now on the air pod it's like
YOU1000000162_S0000049	right now without further due hurry up hurry up hurry up way less isolation i hear the fan on the camera here we go beginning
YOU1000000162_S0000050	you know neither are are blown my brains out you know obviously i have tried some very expensive headphones in this spot in this seat right here
YOU1000000162_S0000051	we have done it together you and i jack her whoever else happens to be behind here and give a day these are dental floss situations look at them
YOU1000000162_S0000052	in terms of sounds i think i can say based on a real quick test right there the buds
YOU1000000162_S0000054	it's there's a bit more thump to it maybe my expectations were too high
YOU1000000162_S0000055	you're probably closer to this performance than they are to like a full on para headphone performance
YOU1000000162_S0000056	that said the most striking difference for me between the two is the fit the and the feel right
YOU1000000162_S0000057	and the sound seal when you put these on you feel isolated but there's a drawback to that i noticed they are in my ears a little bit more
YOU1000000162_S0000058	this i don't even feel it this is a a kind of a tighter feel if i had to choose this is a bit more comfortable for my particular ear canal
YOU1000000162_S0000059	and that part of the reason i think i keep reaching for the air pods in the first place not because they sound the best but because you just not even notice you're wearing them that could be a good thing or a bad thing
YOU1000000162_S0000060	neither are going to be an amazing audio experience but really these products are about convenience
YOU1000000162_S0000061	so evaluating on them on convenience you have to give certain points to the new samsung product because of the fact that it can charge wirelessly and off of the phone itself
YOU1000000162_S0000062	also the app gives you more configurability also another thing worth noting the galaxy buds are a bit cheaper than the air pods
YOU1000000162_S0000063	so that's not much of a surprise that is hard pick i really don't know i mean it might be so simple as if you are on um on samsung or on android you can might go for easily
YOU1000000162_S0000064	if you're on the i o s you'll probably go for these just for the easier pairing across devices
YOU1000000162_S0000065	oh it's a hard decision i had say if i am about to do some physical activity if i'm going for a jog or something i don't jog but like let's say i did
YOU1000000162_S0000066	i will probably reach for these ones this is a bit more confident and in the fit but if it's just if it's in an environment like around the house
YOU1000000162_S0000067	i actually really like the idea of not feeling the thing in your ear as stupid as that looks you'll forget that it's there
YOU1000000162_S0000068	i already have so many great sounding headphones if i wanna get down to business with music i think i'll probably still reach for these more because of that factor
YOU1000000162_S0000069	and then also keep my sony headphones the dedicated over ear headphones with the noise cancellation and everything else
YOU1000000162_S0000070	keep those for that discerning listening but if i didn't have those other headphones and i needed something that could isolate better than the air pods
YOU1000000162_S0000071	and i can only have one pair i only had a hundred and thirty bucks for one pair i probably go for these
YOU1000000162_S0000072	so i only have one pair of headphones i'll probably would choose these over these but in conjunction with a really nice pair that you use sometimes
YOU1000000162_S0000073	this is the i don't even notice i am wearing them head set that's the bottom line
YOU1000000163_S0000000	okay so back in december twenty eighteen we made a video on one of the best options in terms of smart watches for android users and that was this watch the mobvoi ticwatch pro
YOU1000000163_S0000001	and what was really unique about this smartwatch was that it actually came with not one but two displays
YOU1000000163_S0000002	yes one of them being an f s t n panel and thanks to its dual display panel the battery life was absolutely insane
YOU1000000163_S0000003	so up to thirty days on a smartwatch which was something that has never be done before
YOU1000000163_S0000004	it came with the best specs you can get on a smartwatch today
YOU1000000163_S0000005	after an incredible price of just over two hundred pounds
YOU1000000163_S0000006	if you wanna check out the full video on the ticwatch pro you can find it here
YOU1000000163_S0000007	but now mobvoi has released a brand new smartwatch for twenty nineteen it's called the ticwatch e-two
YOU1000000163_S0000008	it not only comes with some extra features even offered to pro but it's also even less expensive than the pros
YOU1000000163_S0000009	starting at just one hundred and forty-five pounds
YOU1000000163_S0000010	and mobvoi has sent one over as well as sponsored this video for me to take a look at
YOU1000000163_S0000011	so let's see how good this watch really is for just one hundred and sixty dollars
YOU1000000163_S0000012	or one hundred and forty-five pounds is it actually worth it's you know for this price um i'm quite curious i'm guessing some of you might me quite curious as well
YOU1000000163_S0000013	so grab some snacks and let's have a look
YOU1000000163_S0000015	okay so inside the box we get the watch itself the quick start guide as well as the charger
YOU1000000163_S0000016	now with most android smartwatches the charger has those charging panes and you have to line up manually the watch with the panes which i really don't like
YOU1000000163_S0000017	now with the e-two while the charger does have those panes the charger itself is actually magnetic so it automatically lines itself up
YOU1000000163_S0000018	with the watch okay so who is the ticwatch e-two for and what does it do and in the end is it is it really worth it
YOU1000000163_S0000019	well starting off with the who this is for while the ticwatch pro was mobvoi's highest and smartwatch made out of stainless steel and with a thirty day battery life the e-two was actually made with fitness and swimming in mind
YOU1000000163_S0000020	okay so it has weaker specs than the pro but it's better for swimming and fitness right
YOU1000000163_S0000021	well to my surprise the e-two actually has the exact in specs as the more expensive ticwatch pro and in some cases it even offers more than the pro does
YOU1000000163_S0000022	for example even though the e-two does not offer the same dual display technology as the pro does it does have the exact in display the main display as the pro
YOU1000000163_S0000023	so this is a one point four inch amoled display at four hundred by four hundred pixels of resolution which at the moment is actually the highest resolution display on any android smartwatch so text is razor sharp on this
YOU1000000163_S0000024	colors just pop so everything is very vibrant on this display and since this is an amoled panel you don't just get those perfect black levels but you also get
YOU1000000163_S0000025	yes it's always on display which if you're coming from something like an apple watch this is a very very welcome addition
YOU1000000163_S0000026	you know being able to see the time all the time on your display
YOU1000000163_S0000027	and the brightness is really good as well and i haven't had any issues reading this in bright sunlight outdoors so yeah overall this is this is a great display
YOU1000000163_S0000028	in fact ah this is the best panel that you can get at the moment on any android smartwatch today
YOU1000000163_S0000029	ah and the ticwatch e-two actually has it at just one hundred and sixty dollars
YOU1000000163_S0000030	and interesting enough it's not just the display that's great ah the specs are really good as well
YOU1000000163_S0000031	we get a qualcomm snapdragon i gonna wear twenty-one hundred processor which yes it is unfortunately not the newly released thirty-one hundred processor
YOU1000000163_S0000032	but considering its price points and the fact that there are almost no smartwatches using the thirty-one hundred processors yet
YOU1000000163_S0000033	aside from just three watches the montblanc summit two the fossil gen four sport and the louis vuitton ah tambour horizon second gen
YOU1000000163_S0000034	so yeah the twenty-one hundred is the best you could ask for at this price the e-two also comes with five hundred and twelve megabytes of ram
YOU1000000163_S0000035	as well as forty gigabytes of internal storage so ah add this to the twenty-one hundred processor and the four hundred by four hundred pixel one point four inch amoled display and there you go you have flagship level specs
YOU1000000163_S0000036	ah on an android smart watch and and something that's actually priced extremely extremely competitive
YOU1000000163_S0000037	and performance wise i personally haven't had any issues at all with e-two ah so menus were fluid risk action happened pretty much in an instant
YOU1000000163_S0000038	apps open very quickly and activating the google assistant was very fast
YOU1000000163_S0000039	as well so yeah performance wise the e-two gets my seal of approval
YOU1000000163_S0000040	and since e-two comes with google's operating system so wear o s two out of the box ah you get the exact same features as you would with all the other premium android smartwatches so
YOU1000000163_S0000041	ah you get access to google's full wear o s play store you get access to thousands of third party watch faces and you can even make your own
YOU1000000163_S0000042	if you haven't found one that you really like so yeah you can create your own custom watch faces if you could choose to do so so i really really like this feature which is missing from you know something like the apple watch
YOU1000000163_S0000043	and speaking of watch faces there are three of them that were made by mobvoi and come pre-installed ah on the ticwatch e-two and i really really love the way they look so they have this minimalistic look
YOU1000000163_S0000044	with red black and white so yeah they're really nice nicely designed and i i do love all of them
YOU1000000163_S0000045	and now the getting through the menus is also very easy by the way and intuitive so you swipe up to access your notifications you swipe down to access your control toggles or things such as brightness
YOU1000000163_S0000046	low battery mode airplane mode and so on do not disturb um so yeah pretty much just like on your smartphone then you swipe right to access the google assistant cards
YOU1000000163_S0000047	so things such as the current weather your plane ticket your latest news um all that will be there so yeah very similar experience to you know google now
YOU1000000163_S0000048	then you swipe left you open up the fitness panel that shows you your steps and calories that you burned
YOU1000000163_S0000050	throughout the day and tapping on this actually opens up a dedicated ticwatch workouts app
YOU1000000163_S0000051	and finally pressing on the crown opens up the app menu so this is where you can access your third party apps and system settings
YOU1000000163_S0000052	and then holding on the crown activates the google assistant which you can also activate by using your voice by you know saying just ah the command okay google
YOU1000000163_S0000053	i'm not gonna hopefully i haven't activated your devices but yeah you can start asking questions or ask for directions
YOU1000000163_S0000054	ah weather all that so it's just like using google assistant on your smartphone
YOU1000000163_S0000055	okay so great display great performance but what does the e-two do more over other android smartwatches aside from the very low price
YOU1000000163_S0000056	well maybe other android smartwatches today are water resistant for example the ticwatch pro ah was ip sixty-eight certified so up to one point five meter submersion up to thirty minutes
YOU1000000163_S0000057	but the e-two is a bit of a special one because this is one of the very very few smartwatches that are actually waterproof not water resistant but waterproof
YOU1000000163_S0000058	so the e-two is waterproof up to five atmospheres of pressure which is about fifty meters of depth
YOU1000000163_S0000059	so same as with an apple watch series two or newer you can take this ah with you when you're swimming or even snorkeling yes up to fifty meters
YOU1000000163_S0000060	so um that's ah pretty impressive especially at this price point and e-two even comes ah with its own built it exercise app the workouts app that i mentioned before
YOU1000000163_S0000061	which does include a swimming mode so ah now you can track your pace the duration the laps and even the number of strokes that you have taken
YOU1000000163_S0000062	and e-two also features a built in gps which not a lot of smartwatches do by the way ah especially especially not at this price point
YOU1000000163_S0000063	ah so if you just wanna go out for a run and take the e-two with you this one is perfectly capable of doing that so you'd be able to track ah your path exactly where you run your run time
YOU1000000163_S0000064	ah your heart rate and speaking of heart rate tracking the e-two now comes with mobvoi's heart rate monitor two point though
YOU1000000163_S0000065	which actually measures your heart rate continuously so twenty-four seven until obviously the battery dies
YOU1000000163_S0000066	so most smartwatches only measure every hour or every ten minutes ah or when you're doing a workout but the e-two constantly measures your heart rate and then shows you graphs on how your heart rate was at different times
YOU1000000163_S0000067	throughout the day and speaking of the battery um how is it well mobvoi says that the e-two would last you ah for up to forty-eight hours which is pretty good now personally
YOU1000000163_S0000068	ah it last me for about a day a day and a half but it does depend on how you use it and you know what exactly you do with your with your smartwatch
YOU1000000163_S0000069	because for example if you go out on a run and have the gps on and you are also tracking your workout then the battery life would only last you for a few hours and this applies to any smartwatch including the apple watch
YOU1000000163_S0000070	okay so so far so good the ticwatch e-two seems like it cannot exist at this price point
YOU1000000163_S0000071	so what's the catch well it does not have nfc so if you're into google pay then you won't be able to use google pay with the ticwatch e-two
YOU1000000163_S0000072	and then the design is indeed quite chunky so it's quite it's quite a thick smartwatch
YOU1000000163_S0000073	u but aside from these two things you get a large amoled display with no notch or cutouts you get the highest resolution display on any android smartwatch you get a qualcomm snapdragon wear twenty-one hundred processor
YOU1000000163_S0000074	five hundred and twelve megabytes of ram and four gigabytes of internal storage so all of these are flagship specs and the fact that it comes with a twenty-four hour heart rate monitor
YOU1000000163_S0000075	a fifty meter water resistance and it only costs one hundred and sixty dollars at the moment so it might get cheaper as the time goes on
YOU1000000163_S0000076	i honestly think that this is the best bang for the buck in terms of any smartwatch
YOU1000000163_S0000077	and if you use the coupon code zone of tech you actually get a ten percent discount on both amazon and the mobvoi official website both of them linked in the description below
YOU1000000163_S0000078	and probably ah the best part about the e-two is that well it actually works on ios as well so if you have an iphone you can give this a try you can use it because it works
YOU1000000163_S0000079	there you go if you ever wanted an alternative to the apple watch well the e-two is half the cost offering features such as an always on display which the apple watch even lacks
YOU1000000163_S0000080	but no matter if you're team ios or team android if you need an affordable smartwatch that can literally do anything ah this is honestly the best option at the moment
YOU1000000163_S0000081	so yeah this was a this was a really interesting video to do and it's honestly a really interesting product so yeah thanks to mobvoi for sponsoring this video as always all opinions are my own
YOU1000000163_S0000082	as in any of our sponsored videos but yeah feel free to check it out i highly recommend it

YOU1000000164_S0000014	the lego batman movie not long ago the idea of a movie based on legos seemed too silly for words
YOU1000000164_S0000015	but then the lego movie wrapped up nearly four hundred and seventy million dollars while making us all root for plastic bricks
YOU1000000164_S0000016	and play everything is awesome on endless repeat

YOU1000000164_S0000022	the great wall of china was built to keep out more than just unwanted human neighbors
YOU1000000164_S0000023	from everything we have seen so far the great wall will at least be a spectacular showcase of effects heavy cinematography
YOU1000000164_S0000024	logan
YOU1000000164_S0000025	hugh jackman has played wolverine for so long that it's nearly impossible to imagine anyone else in the role
YOU1000000164_S0000026	soon twentieth century fox will need to figure out who'll be the next actor to play the part

YOU1000000164_S0000036	what could possibly go wrong
YOU1000000164_S0000038	beauty and the beast
YOU1000000164_S0000039	like disney's earlier beauty this version draws inspiration from the classic fairy tale about a prince played here by dan stevens
YOU1000000164_S0000040	who is cursed with a grotesque appearance yet he finds love in the pure hearted maiden played by emma watson
YOU1000000164_S0000041	who is imprisoned in his castle after her father offers her up in a deal to spare his own life
YOU1000000164_S0000042	like a lot of stories from the era it's pretty dark
YOU1000000164_S0000043	but disney's animated adaptation put a family friendly spin on it with music and humor and we can expect the same here
YOU1000000164_S0000044	plus a cast that includes ewan mcgregor and sir ian mckellen
YOU1000000164_S0000045	power rangers
YOU1000000164_S0000046	the forthcoming power rangers isn't the first movie to capitalize on the mighty morphin nineties craze of course
YOU1000000164_S0000047	however director dean israelite's take on the story offers a much more serious and emotionally charged account
YOU1000000164_S0000048	of how these misfit teens manage to become a band of unlikely world saviors battling back the forces of evil
YOU1000000164_S0000049	if the film does manage to renew even a little bit of the power rangers frenzy that the series enjoyed in the nineties it's going to be massive
YOU1000000164_S0000050	ghost in the shell

YOU1000000164_S0000053	it promises to offer the same kind of gnarly effects and existential featurism
YOU1000000164_S0000055	that captivated audiences in films like the matrix
YOU1000000164_S0000056	scarlett johansson's own turn in lucy and the fifth element sign us up

YOU1000000164_S0000062	guardians of the galaxy volume two
YOU1000000164_S0000063	initially it seemed like a hilariously dumb idea for marvel to turn a relatively obscure comic about a rag tag team of intergalactic do-gooders
YOU1000000164_S0000064	whose ranks included a raccoon like creature and an alien resembling a sentient tree into a two hundred million dollar movie
YOU1000000164_S0000065	nearly seven hundred and seventy-five million in box office receipts later
YOU1000000164_S0000066	the guardians of the galaxy could be the start of an avengers style franchise for the studio
YOU1000000164_S0000067	while we don't have many details regarding what they will be up to this time around it's pretty much given that it'll be tons of fun

YOU1000000164_S0000072	alien covenant
YOU1000000164_S0000073	fans who feel prometheus didn't tie into the alien film strongly enough might be better served by alien covenant

YOU1000000164_S0000079	and its path to development has been strewn with script difficulties and budget introduce delays
YOU1000000164_S0000080	still any new chapter in a franchise that's grossed nearly four billion dollars counts as a promising development for the studio
YOU1000000164_S0000081	and disney has stood by while producer jerry bruckheimer steered pirates of the caribbean dead men tell no tales to its destination
YOU1000000164_S0000082	wonder woman

YOU1000000164_S0000087	world war z two
YOU1000000164_S0000088	the first world war z turned out to be surprisingly entertaining as well as extremely commercially successful
YOU1000000164_S0000089	that brings us to the inevitable sequel world war z two in which brad pitt returns to battle the zombie plague

YOU1000000164_S0000101	plus plenty of action and lots of lead-ins to the assortment of spin off films the studio is planning

YOU1000000164_S0000138	and tim carrey's original performance as town terrorizing clown pennywise has set a high bar for anyone to follow in the role
YOU1000000164_S0000139	so when director andres muschietti revealed his new version of the character now played by bill skarsgard

YOU1000000165_S0000182	his two thousand sixteen golden globe was well-earned but an oscar is overdue
YOU1000000165_S0000183	number five christian bale many an actor has committed life and limb to a role
YOU1000000165_S0000184	but there's arguably no actor who invests more of themselves in a character than christian bale
YOU1000000165_S0000185	and i'm a kip brother
YOU1000000165_S0000187	is all us pity fighting around you know and we can't get to losing it's a manly thing no but we gonna we gonna break that one man be right
YOU1000000165_S0000188	want him to be deathly thin no problem overweight you can do that in peak physical shape with enough notice consider it done while he's famous for radically changing his body to suit a role
YOU1000000165_S0000189	that shouldn't be allowed to over shadow his incredible acting ability
YOU1000000165_S0000191	as it so often does his supporting role in the fighter was absolutely captivating the golden globe and oscar simply could not have gone to anyone else
YOU1000000165_S0000192	and throughout the decade he is continued to deliver in a very consistent manner
YOU1000000165_S0000193	including standout performances in american hustle the big short vice and ford v ferrari
YOU1000000165_S0000194	number four amy adams this american actress often flies under the radar
YOU1000000165_S0000195	even while turning in some of the best performances of the decade because based on her filmography she should be at the center of attention pretty much always
YOU1000000165_S0000196	adams kicked off the decade with a best supporting actress nomination for the fighter and got the same nod in two thousand thirteen for her role in the master

YOU1000000165_S0000198	before landing yet another best supporting actress oscar nod for vice
YOU1000000165_S0000199	so can you change
YOU1000000165_S0000201	can you change or am i wasting my goddamn time
YOU1000000165_S0000202	though she is yet to win the academy award she deserves she does have two golden globes for best actress and quite frankly the lack of recognition for her role in a rival is criminal
YOU1000000165_S0000203	number three jake gyllenhaal
YOU1000000165_S0000204	not unlike amy addams this acclaimed actor tends to keep a relatively lower profile for someone of his status but his filmography reveals just how talented an actor he really is
YOU1000000165_S0000205	especially over the last decade he kicked off the two thousand ten's with the critically lauded but underrated source code
YOU1000000165_S0000206	before blowing critics away in a wide variety of films including end of watch prisoners wildlife and more
YOU1000000165_S0000207	the academy hasn't shown him much love since brokeback mountain which is quite frankly shocking considering his performance in nightcrawler was among the year's best
YOU1000000165_S0000208	i'm looking for a job
YOU1000000165_S0000210	in fact i made up my mind to find a career that i can learn and grow into who am i i'm a hard worker i set high goals and i've been told that i'm persistent
YOU1000000165_S0000211	he's just about the last actor we expected to see battling spidey but wouldn't you know it he's just as good in a massive blockbuster as in a gritty drama or a psychological thriller

YOU1000000165_S0000218	no one needs to be reminded of the many award-winning films he starred in over the years but since we're talking about the last decade
YOU1000000165_S0000219	let's review his astonishing feature filmography inception jay edgar django unchained the great gatsby the wolf of wall street the revenant once upon a time in hollywood
YOU1000000165_S0000220	seven films mostly of the highest quality and even when any of his films falter this master of his craft never fails to turn in a solid performance
YOU1000000165_S0000221	as the revenant and the wolf of wall street remind us he is also very versatile when he steps into a character he truly brings them to life
YOU1000000165_S0000222	he sure knows that
YOU1000000165_S0000224	this is my home
YOU1000000165_S0000225	so i guess what we're saying is if some of these people don't already have oscars they will soon has your favorite actor appeared on this list so far if not he or she might soon
YOU1000000165_S0000226	let's look at the honorable mentions and then we'll see who clocks in at number one actor of the last decade

YOU1000000166_S0000028	it's got to be a hard job set the retirement age to fifty-five and you only gets to retire before he can barely string a sentence together backwards
YOU1000000166_S0000029	do or do not there is no try
YOU1000000166_S0000030	but if you set the retirement age to like i don't know five hundred fifty han solo's never gonna see his pension
YOU1000000166_S0000032	wonder there was a rebellion against these guys now in case you aren't hip with the kids lately or didn't trample your loved ones in your rush to sign up for disney plus
YOU1000000166_S0000033	i'm talking about baby yoda the tiny cuddly wobbly bubba kins of the new disney plus show the mandalorian
YOU1000000166_S0000034	the baby version of a member of yoda's species who is in one episode already the most endearing character in this franchise
YOU1000000166_S0000035	move aside korg's get the boot ewoks baby yoda filled the void that you never could
YOU1000000166_S0000036	baby yoda is like cute section but the kicker is that by our standards he's not even a baby the mandalorian depicts him as a fifty year old toddler
YOU1000000166_S0000037	their age that's all you can give me
YOU1000000166_S0000038	yes they're fifty years old
YOU1000000166_S0000039	by star wars standards that would make baby yoda part of the silent generation by that i mean the one that came before the baby boomers which of course in star wars where all the babies that were born right after alderaan went
YOU1000000166_S0000040	boom okay boomers there's one less planet in the galaxy
YOU1000000166_S0000041	and listen this topic hits really close to home for me because i currently own a toddler
YOU1000000166_S0000042	you'll hear parents saying stuff like i wish they could stay little forever but half a century of diaper changes is something no one is signing up for
YOU1000000166_S0000043	but all those diapers and memes got me thinking fifty years is a really long time to be a baby a relatively helpless baby
YOU1000000166_S0000044	and i'm saying that as a human the species with the longest adolescence on the planet so how does this insanely long childhood happen
YOU1000000166_S0000045	and is there any way that fifty years of tummy time could be remotely plausible scientifically well i started researching as i do
YOU1000000166_S0000046	when it turns out that it's not just scientific precedent but an explanation here for almost everything that we know about the entire yoda species
YOU1000000166_S0000047	that's right understanding the biology of baby yoda isn't just a fun fact from the mandalorian or me overthinking a sci-fi franchise
YOU1000000166_S0000048	but it's the single key to understanding the most beloved character in star wars history
YOU1000000166_S0000049	and why he yoda by the time we get to the main series of movies is pretty much the only one of his species left
YOU1000000166_S0000050	to gotta say between this theory and the last one i did over on game theory about star wars this force being pretty much scientifically accurate which if you haven't watched
YOU1000000166_S0000051	you absolutely should after this episode i'm starting to think that george lucas might secretly be a scientific genius almost let's not give him too much credit
YOU1000000166_S0000052	so join me as i take a look into the evolutionary biology of baby yoda and finally figure out why they're so cool and also why they're practically extinct
YOU1000000166_S0000053	before we open your biology textbooks to chapter five we need to clear the air on one thing no i don't know the actual name of the species yoda come from
YOU1000000166_S0000054	but you know what i'm in good company because george lucas didn't either george lucas specifically didn't want yoda species to have a name
YOU1000000166_S0000055	and rarely sanctioned work that revealed information about their lore so even though the yoda species existed in places like knights of the old republic the video game information about them doesn't appear in anything
YOU1000000166_S0000056	that's officially canon anymore so instead of spending this entire episode saying the word yoda and having to clarify between whether i'm talking about yoda the species or yoda the individual member of that species
YOU1000000166_S0000057	i'll instead be referring to the yoda species as the tri-dactyls
YOU1000000166_S0000058	because their extremities have three digits right but bear in mind that's really just a fan-made designation for all the members of the yoda species that we're currently aware of which are just three
YOU1000000166_S0000059	honestly you got original yoda you got yaddle from the phantom menace who just appears for a couple seconds and baby yoda whatever his name ends up being from the mandalorian
YOU1000000166_S0000060	so with that bit of housekeeping out of the way and with the very short list of actual known members of the yoda species what do we know about tri-dactyl
YOU1000000166_S0000061	we know that yoda lived to the ripe old age of nine hundred in return of the jedi which everyone else is surprised about but he isn't seeming to indicate that it's not really that big of a deal for him
YOU1000000166_S0000062	baby yoda who's just stuck with that name for this episode i guess is fifty but functionally he's about a ten months old
YOU1000000166_S0000063	if my kid is any indication he's nonverbal but he is capable of walking and getting into trouble so we know
YOU1000000166_S0000064	as a tri-dactyl you get nine hundred years in the galaxy on the high end but at least the
YOU1000000166_S0000066	first fifty of them are spent as a baby which i guess leaves like a hundred to make it through high school
YOU1000000166_S0000067	another two hundred years of living in your parents basement before finally getting your own apartment at the tender age of three hundred
YOU1000000166_S0000068	now because we're working in outer space and in a fictional franchise it's worth double-checking when they say that baby yoda is fifty years old in the mandalorian
YOU1000000166_S0000069	does that translate to years as we understand them here on earth and it appears like it does according to wikipedia the republic's standardized it's time based on coruscant
YOU1000000166_S0000070	which conveniently rotates its sun exactly once every three hundred and sixty five coruscantian days which are broken down themselves into twenty-four hour increments
YOU1000000166_S0000071	and then minutes that are incredibly close to our own minutes so when yoda says that he's nine hundred years old it's pretty close to what we think nine hundred years is
YOU1000000166_S0000072	and the mandalorian has every reason to be surprised that his fifty year old mark was still a baby
YOU1000000166_S0000073	so knowing that it's time to talk about the biology having such a long development period is more than just an interesting evolutionary quirk
YOU1000000166_S0000074	it actually tells us a lot about how tri-dactyls may have evolved over time mostly because it parallels a lot of our own human evolution
YOU1000000166_S0000075	you see most animals evolved to shorten the amount of time between birth and reproductive maturity so that they can go on and grow their population as fast as possible
YOU1000000166_S0000076	but that's not the only successful evolutionary strategy you may have noticed that us humans have incredibly long and particularly vulnerable childhoods
YOU1000000166_S0000077	when a baby giraffe is born it can stand almost almost almost right away so cute humans on the other hand not so much
YOU1000000166_S0000078	it is taking months if not a year for a baby human to actually get up on its feet so why do humans the smartest animals on the planet
YOU1000000166_S0000079	come out so useless
YOU1000000166_S0000080	well it turns out that the whole issue comes down to our brains you see our brainy heads and the fact that they're so fat have changed our entire course of human evolution
YOU1000000166_S0000081	our ancestors who many believe emerged from sub-saharan africa were among the first species of animals to stop walking around on four legs
YOU1000000166_S0000082	and start walking upon two our brains were big enough that we were able to logic out the idea that it took less energy to walk on two legs
YOU1000000166_S0000083	and it minimized our bald skins exposure to the extremely hot ground temperatures in those african deserts
YOU1000000166_S0000084	as newly bipedal people our evolution started favoring other members of our species who could also walk upright good for us natural selection at its finest
YOU1000000166_S0000085	but there's always a price to pay for innovation you see as we evolved to be more and more capable of walking
YOU1000000166_S0000086	and running around on two legs our bodies evolved to facilitate that and compensate for our changed center of gravity primarily doing this by narrowing our hips
YOU1000000166_S0000087	this in turn helped us to walk upright like champs and all of a sudden we had a problem that big fat head of ours was literally too big to be born
YOU1000000166_S0000088	sure we had ourselves a big brain but now there was nowhere for it to go because our hips were too narrow to accommodate birthing a head that huge
YOU1000000166_S0000089	so human evolution had to change again as the theory goes we started having babies earlier in their gestational period
YOU1000000166_S0000090	earlier at a time when the baby was still tiny and smushy and helpless which would be pretty darn bad for our survival except for one thing
YOU1000000166_S0000091	the heads were still small enough to squeeze up on out of there still a very painful process but now at least it was doable
YOU1000000166_S0000092	and then once the baby was on the other end there would be what's known as the fourth trimester
YOU1000000166_S0000093	an extra trimester of development that happens outside in the real world where we as parents would have to take care of that helpless newborn
YOU1000000166_S0000094	because technically it still should have been developing in the womb it just needed to be you know evicted from its home before it was too big to leave its door
YOU1000000166_S0000095	now let's take a look at her friendly yoda what features do we see well he's bipedal he's small with a disproportionately huge head for his highly evolved brain
YOU1000000166_S0000096	he's got a short highly efficient body with diminutive narrow features including his hips even looking at the basic character model
YOU1000000166_S0000097	you can see how in order to procreate the tri-dactyls would have to have themselves radically different proportions
YOU1000000166_S0000098	you could also see how having a big brain is a huge evolutionary advantage humans are so far at the top of the food chain that we protect other members of the food chain
YOU1000000166_S0000099	tri-dactyls in the star wars universe are the wisest and most powerful force users in the galaxy
YOU1000000166_S0000100	but the downside is that they like us are essentially born too early helpless for months if not years or until at least their dad makes them pay rent
YOU1000000166_S0000101	and their mom stops doing their laundry this theory continues to hold water if we look at infancy for humans versus infancy for tri-dactyls in their first two years
YOU1000000166_S0000102	human baby brains grow to seventy-five percent of their full adult size we don't know if this is the same for tri-dactyls
YOU1000000166_S0000103	but we do know that the proportions of human babies paralleled the proportions of baby yoda enormous head adorably tiny body
YOU1000000166_S0000104	besides making babies hilariously top-heavy these proportions also serve a function in an infancy
YOU1000000166_S0000105	human brains command up to eighty-seven percent of the total energy that the body uses at rest
YOU1000000166_S0000106	meaning that even while sleeping the body is diverting a massive amount of energy to growing the brain
YOU1000000166_S0000107	because of this the rest of the baby's growth legs behind the head where the brain is this according to the expensive tissue hypothesis
YOU1000000166_S0000108	we can see that baby yoda is an extreme version of this principle with a wildly huge and merchandisable head
YOU1000000166_S0000109	and a teeny tiny body making me think that baby yoda is an extremely evolved version of what the human race could look like someday the
YOU1000000166_S0000111	process of evolutionarily elongating the development period is called neoteny
YOU1000000166_S0000112	and after humans benefited from it surviving when our relatives didn't well evolution didn't stop its roll
YOU1000000166_S0000113	humans are actually still experiencing longer development periods now than we even did ten thousand years ago
YOU1000000166_S0000114	the shape of our faces and heads are continually becoming less like our neanderthal cousins by becoming flatter less hairy less oblong
YOU1000000166_S0000115	again we share a lot of these same features with yoda who's small flat faced with an enormous head but if human evolution continues to make our childhoods longer and longer
YOU1000000166_S0000116	the question of course becomes where does it stop well it stops at yoda
YOU1000000166_S0000117	the problem with a long childhood is that a lot can happen when you're tiny and helpless
YOU1000000166_S0000118	eventually there's an evolutionary tipping point where childhood becomes so long that it actually leaves the species too vulnerable to survive into adulthood
YOU1000000166_S0000119	tri-dactyls could very well be the extreme end point of a species like ours
YOU1000000166_S0000120	as the mandalorian clearly shows baby tri-dactyls even fifty year old baby try dactyls aren't capable of taking care of themselves
YOU1000000166_S0000121	sure they have impressive force powers but very little control over on them
YOU1000000166_S0000123	human children similarly are pretty darn helpless and it means that we have to do things like baby-proof the house and make up all kinds of safety rules for kids
YOU1000000166_S0000124	so imagine having to worry about that sort of stuff for fifty or even a hundred years it becomes extremely hard for the species to get their offspring to a place of self-sufficiency
YOU1000000166_S0000125	and that's just the tip of the iceberg natural disasters plagues drone attacks from the empire
YOU1000000166_S0000126	all of those things are gonna be pretty darn hard to avoid but they become a lot easier to bounce back from if suddenly your species can repopulate quickly
YOU1000000166_S0000127	but if all of a sudden you're spending a hundred years or more to reproduce a single generation
YOU1000000166_S0000128	i mean you're just begging for the next death star to give you a little zap which brings us to yoda
YOU1000000166_S0000129	we know so little about his history but what we're able to theorize is pretty darn incredible he's practically the last of his species
YOU1000000166_S0000130	because of the evolutionary double-edged sword that he's dealing with on one hand he's one of the most highly evolved beings in the galaxy
YOU1000000166_S0000131	he's so evolved that his species can no longer survive they're completely obscure
YOU1000000166_S0000132	it's incredibly tragic and no we don't have any of the details about how the tri-dactyls were wiped out but that elongated childhood
YOU1000000166_S0000133	that extended neoteny to the extremes of fifty plus years of childhood that is certainly a massive contributor
YOU1000000166_S0000134	as to why so incredibly star wars the series often derided as being space fantasy
YOU1000000166_S0000135	and not science fiction turns out to be scientifically plausible yet again so got to hand it to you lucas i'm pretty stunned
YOU1000000166_S0000136	now i've tried to help you out with this and the whole midi-chlorines powering the force thing but i got to admit still have some quibbles to level at you about the jedi's recruitment practices
YOU1000000166_S0000137	now it'll be coming up ah pretty soon we have some bones to pick on that front okay friend in the meantime if you didn't see the real life equivalent of midi-chlorians
YOU1000000166_S0000138	and how they're actually powering the real life force in your day to day life click the video that you see on screen right now
YOU1000000166_S0000139	that'll take you that'll take you to my other science of star wars episode over on game theory looking at midi-chlorian's mitochondria
YOU1000000166_S0000140	and how we're all just a little bit jedi in the meantime remember that's just a theory a film theory and cuts
YOU1000000167_S0000000	winnie the pooh and the royal birthday inspired by a a milne and e h shepherd with the declarations by mark burgess
YOU1000000167_S0000002	read by jim broadbent
YOU1000000167_S0000004	you could tell christopher robin had something important to say from the way he clasped his knees tightly and wriggled his toes
YOU1000000167_S0000006	everybody gathered round and looked at him expectantly
YOU1000000167_S0000008	i've heard that her majesty christopher robin began ah squeaked piglet in a state of great excitement
YOU1000000167_S0000009	a royal highness he went on quite so quite so agreed rabbit the queen of england he said quickly before anyone else could interrupt him
YOU1000000167_S0000010	who the queen said pooh bear much relieved the other people you mentioned sounded much too tall and fearsome but the queen is quite different
YOU1000000167_S0000011	pooh had once sent a letter and was told to stick on a small picture of the queen it stuck more to his nose than to the letter
YOU1000000167_S0000012	but it told the postman that it was most urgent and that the queen says it must be sent and so he was sure it had been
YOU1000000167_S0000014	as i was saying said crystal robin passing pooh a honey sandwich so that he might continue speaking
YOU1000000167_S0000015	her majesty the queen is celebrating an important birthday her ninetieth birthday and we should too celebrate it
YOU1000000167_S0000016	that is by giving her a present
YOU1000000167_S0000018	i had a present once sighed eeyore wistfully
YOU1000000167_S0000020	two in fact if i may boast a little
YOU1000000167_S0000022	one was rather small and damp and the other somewhat larger and sticky
YOU1000000167_S0000024	but i don't like to complain
YOU1000000167_S0000026	a present is something and to have two is something else
YOU1000000167_S0000028	both pooh and piglet blushed slightly they had a memory of a wonderful balloon and a large jar of the best honey
YOU1000000167_S0000029	that had begun as exceedingly good presents and then
YOU1000000167_S0000030	due to various mishaps had become rather disappointing presents
YOU1000000167_S0000031	but which were presents nevertheless and as eeyore had said that was something
YOU1000000167_S0000033	the question is said rabbit importantly what do queens like best
YOU1000000167_S0000035	honey i should think sighed pooh looking at the small sticky crumb where the honey sandwiches had once been
YOU1000000167_S0000037	i've heard said christopher robin who knew a great deal about faraway places like the other side of the forest and london
YOU1000000167_S0000038	that the queen has a grand tea every day in her palace with buttered toast and crumpets
YOU1000000167_S0000039	so i shouldn't think we'd need to give her anything to eat a present should be something to treasure
YOU1000000167_S0000041	i've never heard much luck finding treasure sighed pooh
YOU1000000167_S0000043	but i did once find the north pole do you suppose the queen might like that
YOU1000000167_S0000045	the friends thought this an excellent idea but it wasn't long before they realized that finding the north pole once was a very fine thing
YOU1000000167_S0000046	but that finding it again was an altogether different thing
YOU1000000167_S0000048	suddenly the forest seemed to be full of sticks that could or could not be the north pole
YOU1000000167_S0000050	this will never do announced rabbit
YOU1000000167_S0000052	do mumbled pooh that brings to mind a little hum which i'd like to hum
YOU1000000167_S0000053	if it was felt that a hum was called for at such a time of thoughtfulness and without waiting for a reply he began
YOU1000000167_S0000055	the queen lived in her palace as queens often do
YOU1000000167_S0000057	doing all those busy things busy queens do
YOU1000000167_S0000059	but the queen could never know as you and i do
YOU1000000167_S0000061	that doing nothing much can be the best thing to do
YOU1000000167_S0000063	so from a forest far away for your special day
YOU1000000167_S0000065	we're sending you some quiet and a little time to play
YOU1000000167_S0000067	and quiet there was
YOU1000000167_S0000069	the sort of quiet that makes the tip of your nose turn a sunset shade of pink
YOU1000000167_S0000071	bear
YOU1000000167_S0000073	announced christopher robin solemnly
YOU1000000167_S0000075	that hum is fit for a queen that hum shall be the queen's present owl shall write it out and you and i
YOU1000000167_S0000076	and eeyore will deliver it to buckingham palace and piglet must come too because london is a very big place indeed
YOU1000000167_S0000077	and even small animals if they are very good friends can make everything all right
YOU1000000167_S0000079	and so it was decided and owl was called for owl fussed here and fussed there
YOU1000000167_S0000081	and used up a good deal of time paper and ink but at last it was done and everyone admired it oh
YOU1000000167_S0000082	kanga who knew how important presentation was especially for queens took the hum rolled it
YOU1000000167_S0000083	and tied a thick vine around it into the vine she twisted wild heather columbine buttercups meadow sweet thyme
YOU1000000167_S0000084	and lastly a thistle kindly donated by eeyore
YOU1000000167_S0000086	christopher robin also found a beautiful bright red balloon which he thought the queen might enjoy on gray days
YOU1000000167_S0000087	piglet you should hold it he said that way we won't lose you in the crowd
YOU1000000167_S0000089	piglet held on very tightly to the balloon he wasn't quite sure what a crowd was something like a dark cloud perhaps
YOU1000000167_S0000090	but in any case he didn't want to get lost in it and was pleased the balloon would help
YOU1000000167_S0000092	so the presents were ready and side by side winnie the pooh edward bear bear of very little brain brave adventurer
YOU1000000167_S0000093	and loyal friend his small companion piglet eeyore and christopher robin set off for london
YOU1000000167_S0000095	of course london is on quite the other side remarked christopher robin as they were walking
YOU1000000167_S0000097	of the sea asked pooh somewhat alarmed
YOU1000000167_S0000099	not the sea i shouldn't think replied christopher robin whose geography lesson so far had been mostly spent coloring in edgy bits
YOU1000000167_S0000100	but but certainly the country or county i'm not quite sure which in any case it is very far off when we shall have to catch a train
YOU1000000167_S0000102	i do hope it wants to be caught said pooh who was already a little out of puff from the walk but the train was good enough to stop for them in the station
YOU1000000167_S0000103	so there was no catching to be done at all and there was plenty of time to climb aboard and find four comfy seats
YOU1000000167_S0000104	and then they were off
YOU1000000167_S0000106	would you be so kind as to say very close by asked anxious piglet as they got off the train at victoria station
YOU1000000167_S0000107	he hadn't expected london to have quite so many legs
YOU1000000167_S0000109	there were pinstriped legs big booted legs and some legs balanced on pointy shoes which seemed to have a little stick stuck to the bottom of each sole
YOU1000000167_S0000111	and they were all in a terrible rush and seemed to know exactly where they were going
YOU1000000167_S0000113	christopher robin pooh piglet and eeyore launched themselves into this vast forest of legs and hoped they'd come out alright
YOU1000000167_S0000115	they emerged into a busy street
YOU1000000167_S0000117	christopher robin told them that the large black vehicles rushing past were called traffic
YOU1000000167_S0000119	pooh thought that traffic looked like giant shiny beetles and thinking of them as beetles made it less worrying
YOU1000000167_S0000121	the friends walked and they walked
YOU1000000167_S0000122	hm but eeyore sighs that had started out as small puffs were now growing so large and loud
YOU1000000167_S0000123	that they were worried he would run out of puff altogether and winnie the pooh's legs were known for their stoutness not their brisk walking
YOU1000000167_S0000124	and piglet's legs were so short that they were hardly worth speaking of at all
YOU1000000167_S0000126	so christopher robin suggested they ride on a bus the rest of the way to buckingham palace
YOU1000000167_S0000128	most considerate i'm sure sighed eeyore
YOU1000000167_S0000130	although slightly less puffely this time
YOU1000000167_S0000132	the friends have never been on a bus before and this was a most unusual one it had winding stairs
YOU1000000167_S0000133	and up at the top there was no roof at all
YOU1000000167_S0000135	as the bus began to move the wind did its best to blow piglets ears right off and he nearly lost hold of the balloon
YOU1000000167_S0000136	we'll call this the blustery bus laughed christopher robin
YOU1000000167_S0000138	the bus took the friends past a great many important buildings
YOU1000000167_S0000140	and christopher robin didn't know all the names
YOU1000000167_S0000142	there was one very grand old shop which pooh found strangely familiar but he told himself he was being silly
YOU1000000167_S0000143	as this was surely his first visit to london
YOU1000000167_S0000145	at the next stop they were able to get out and stretch their legs a little
YOU1000000167_S0000147	this is trafalgar square said the driver look out for the lions
YOU1000000167_S0000149	lions gasped piglet in some alarm and there were indeed lions
YOU1000000167_S0000150	but thankfully not the furry ones with hot breath and hungry eyes that they were imagining
YOU1000000167_S0000152	these lions were cold majestic and their backs were shiny from where many people had sat upon them
YOU1000000167_S0000156	oh how i'd love to have a lion christopher robin sighed
YOU1000000167_S0000158	but pooh thought that bears were best and pulled christopher robin back to the bus
YOU1000000167_S0000160	the tour then took them past an enormous clock in a high up tower christopher robin told them that this clock's largest bell was called big ben
YOU1000000167_S0000162	i feel sure said pooh that with this clock i could really learn to tell the time with smaller clocks i do try to tell it but it just doesn't listen
YOU1000000167_S0000163	the numbers jump about so and the little hand chases the big hand just to tease it and o'clock isn't an o at all
YOU1000000167_S0000164	and seconds aren't a little something more to eat and everything gets so terribly muddled
YOU1000000167_S0000166	a clock like this though is sure to behave itself
YOU1000000167_S0000168	but the friends couldn't stay to learn to tell the time because the next stop for the bus was buckingham palace
YOU1000000167_S0000170	oh pooh whispered piglet as they climbed off the bus isn't it grand
YOU1000000167_S0000172	and it certainly was behind golden gates windows rose up in every direction rows and rows of windows
YOU1000000167_S0000173	and above it all the royal standard flag waved proudly in the sky
YOU1000000167_S0000175	the flag means that the queen is at home announced christopher robin who knew a great deal about queens and such like because he had come to buckingham palace once before many years ago
YOU1000000167_S0000177	hm well it's all very well for some complained eeyore i've never had a flag myself
YOU1000000167_S0000179	but then i'm always at home one boggy place is much like another and i don't hold with all this packing up
YOU1000000167_S0000180	and farewell and see you soon palaver
YOU1000000167_S0000182	at that moment a bugle sounded piglet gave a startled jump and then continued jumping in time with the marching band
YOU1000000167_S0000183	to show that it hadn't been a startled jump at all
YOU1000000167_S0000185	the queen's guard marched past they were splendid in their bright red uniforms shiny buttons and tall furry hats
YOU1000000167_S0000187	what do you think they keep under their hats pooh asked piglet a little out of breath after all his jumping
YOU1000000167_S0000189	perhaps a little something to nibble on just a smackerel of something sticky perhaps
YOU1000000167_S0000191	sweet certainly
YOU1000000167_S0000193	pooh's voice faded off into a happy dream
YOU1000000167_S0000195	but all at once there was a stirring in the crowd and the murmur rose up it's the queen the queen is coming
YOU1000000167_S0000197	pooh and piglet squeezed their way to the front of the crowd
YOU1000000167_S0000199	and then they saw a sight that they had always secretly hoped for but had never dared imagined might really happen
YOU1000000167_S0000201	the queen herself was out for a stroll and she was greeting the crowd as she went
YOU1000000167_S0000203	she was just as queenly and smiley and wonderful as they had expected her to be
YOU1000000167_S0000205	the queen was so close that they could have reached out and touched her fine coat
YOU1000000167_S0000207	winnie the pooh knew that it was now or never
YOU1000000167_S0000209	boldly he stepped forward
YOU1000000167_S0000211	and recited his hum in the loudest bravest voice he could manage in the circumstances
YOU1000000167_S0000213	the queen smiled warmly at them all
YOU1000000167_S0000215	behind the queen ran a little boy he was much younger than christopher robin and almost as bouncy as tigger he caught sight of piglet and the balloon
YOU1000000167_S0000216	and he jumped up and down in delight
YOU1000000167_S0000218	the little boy patted piglet fondly and tickled winnie the pooh's ears
YOU1000000167_S0000220	piglet handed him the beautiful balloon and he giggled and skipped away with it
YOU1000000167_S0000222	where's eeyore asked christopher robin anxiously as the queen walked on to greet other people in the crowd
YOU1000000167_S0000224	with all the excitement they had quite forgotten about him
YOU1000000167_S0000226	and then they saw him with his back to them staring up at the palace
YOU1000000167_S0000228	i believe i saw the queen at one of the windows he announced proudly but eeyore began piglet the queen just um
YOU1000000167_S0000229	we must be heading home now interrupted christopher robin who couldn't bear to disappoint dear old eeyore who had missed the whole thing
YOU1000000167_S0000231	later when the story had been retold over and over again winnie the pooh was sure that the queen had said how charming
YOU1000000167_S0000232	but what was certain was that the hum had been shared and the queen had gone
YOU1000000167_S0000234	she was back behind the tall golden gates of buckingham palace where no bear could go
YOU1000000167_S0000237	do you think the queen liked my hum christopher robin asked pooh as they walked down the mall
YOU1000000167_S0000239	silly old bear i'm sure of it he replied squeezing his paws a little tighter
YOU1000000167_S0000241	it must be a very great thing to be ninety years old mused pooh
YOU1000000167_S0000243	pleased to be on his way back home where a little smackerel of something were sure to be awaiting them
YOU1000000167_S0000245	what the friends didn't realize
YOU1000000167_S0000247	that pooh bear had arrived in the forest in the very same year that princess elizabeth was born
YOU1000000167_S0000249	but time is a tricky thing years begin by lazing along slowly and then suddenly up there jump and off they trot as quickly as ever they can
YOU1000000167_S0000251	to winnie the pooh it felt like just yesterday that he had come bumping down those stairs bump bump bump
YOU1000000167_S0000253	and that is just the way it should be
YOU1000000168_S0000001	cutest exotic animals you can actually own do you wanna be another boring pet owner or are you looking to turn a few heads on your next morning stroll
YOU1000000168_S0000002	with your newest animal companion well you could brave the mission and opt for a bengal tiger like mike tyson but a full grown wildcat is quite a piece of work
YOU1000000168_S0000003	and not exactly what we had in mind for today's list we were thinking a little more cute and exotic like the playful chinchilla
YOU1000000168_S0000004	or the fluffy fennec fox perhaps even a goofy crested gecko or a dog sized rodent like the australian capybara
YOU1000000168_S0000005	with a little extra research and work these bizarre and adorable animals could realistically become your next pet so if you're looking to turn a few heads
YOU1000000168_S0000006	and melt a few hearts with your newest unusual animal friend stay tuned as we count down our top ten picks for the cutest exotic animals you can actually own
YOU1000000168_S0000007	as pets oh and if you thought crabs couldn't be sweet then stay tuned for number one
YOU1000000168_S0000008	because this unique and exotic critter is sure to make your aquarium a lot cuter okay let's get started
YOU1000000168_S0000009	ten the capybara on first sight you may confuse this large cuteness for one big guinea pig and you'd actually be right
YOU1000000168_S0000010	the south american capybara is one of the largest rodents in the world it can weigh up to one hundred and forty pounds not to worry
YOU1000000168_S0000011	you won't be needing a huge cage because capybaras are semi aquatic rodents so scratch the dog sized hamster wheel off your list
YOU1000000168_S0000012	because this animal definitely needs access to a body of water in order to swim around like your pool
YOU1000000168_S0000014	although mostly adorable and sweet capybaras can be a challenging pet especially because they're extremely social animals
YOU1000000168_S0000015	so if you're planning on owning one it's best to make room for a couple more this rodent is legal to own in most parts of the world
YOU1000000168_S0000016	although some countries and states may require a separate license but those cute and furry snouts are well worth the extra paperwork
YOU1000000168_S0000017	nine the serval now we can't all adopt a royal bengal tiger as mike tyson once did
YOU1000000168_S0000018	but most cat lovers would surely love to settle for this wild beauty servals can even be litter trained if you start early enough
YOU1000000168_S0000020	these medium-sized african cats are accustomed to warm climates and wide-open spaces
YOU1000000168_S0000021	for you pet owners it means you'll need a moderate amount of space for your exotic cat to feel at home
YOU1000000168_S0000023	servals require lots of daily exercise and love to play so a spacious garden is probably your best bet
YOU1000000168_S0000025	eight the fennec fox as if foxes weren't cute enough we give you the fennec fox
YOU1000000168_S0000026	have a look at those ears they're phenomenal
YOU1000000168_S0000027	these foxes come from the african continent and are the smallest breed of fox in the world
YOU1000000168_S0000029	only reaching about four pounds when fully grown but the same cannot be said about the size of those adorable ears
YOU1000000168_S0000030	if you never quite figure it out whether you're a cat or dog person the fennec fox may become your favorite four-legged companion
YOU1000000168_S0000031	hey what are you doing
YOU1000000168_S0000033	cake
YOU1000000168_S0000035	this fox's behavior can best be described as a cross way between that of a dog and a cat
YOU1000000168_S0000037	they're usually playful and energetic like a dog but just as equally independent like a cat so you'll be fine leaving them home alone for a few hours
YOU1000000168_S0000039	what sets them apart though is that they don't really favor dog nor cat toys this exotic animal can live up to fifteen years
YOU1000000168_S0000040	and is legal to own in most of america with the exception of a few states but hey if you're dying to own one you can always just move to another state
YOU1000000168_S0000042	oh my god
YOU1000000168_S0000044	seven box turtles
YOU1000000168_S0000046	although they can be tricky to care for box turtles make some cute and seriously long term reptilian companions like most turtles
YOU1000000168_S0000048	they carry their homes on their backs and this species can live for up to fifty years
YOU1000000168_S0000050	which may seem like a lot for a household pet but is laughable when compared to jonathan the world's oldest turtle at one hundred and eighty-nine years old
YOU1000000168_S0000052	box turtles like the soaked in water from time to time to rehydrate and cool down
YOU1000000168_S0000054	but that doesn't necessarily make them pro swimmers in fact they're actually land turtles
YOU1000000168_S0000056	they looked pretty clumsy while doing it so despite their sharp beaks rough scaly skin and tiny pointed claws
YOU1000000168_S0000057	a box turtle can make a pretty darn cute addition to your terrarium
YOU1000000168_S0000059	six the chinchilla from hamsters to gerbils rodents have a reputation as one of the cutest household pets
YOU1000000168_S0000060	but on the more exotic end of the spectrum and perhaps ten times more adorable is the chinchilla
YOU1000000168_S0000062	the south-american chinchilla can bond very closely with its caretaker
YOU1000000168_S0000064	but unfortunately is one of the more destructive rodents
YOU1000000168_S0000066	that's not to say they're dangerous or anything they just don't like to be cuddled
YOU1000000168_S0000067	no no no no no ow ow ow you bit me hard
YOU1000000168_S0000068	at least not nearly as much as they love to run around to play they're quite active and get bored pretty easily
YOU1000000168_S0000070	so you'll need more than a plain old hamster wheel to keep these little guys busy
YOU1000000168_S0000072	but we're sure you'll agree those gigantic ears and that fluffy tail are well worth the extra effort
YOU1000000168_S0000074	five the sugar glider
YOU1000000168_S0000076	if you've ever wondered what it's like to own a flying squirrel
YOU1000000168_S0000078	then you should purchase a sugar glider while squirrels can't be domesticated sugar gliders are the next best thing and many would agree a lot cuter
YOU1000000168_S0000080	just look at those eyes
YOU1000000168_S0000082	although the two looks similar sugar gliders are actually part of the marsupial family just like kangaroos
YOU1000000168_S0000084	the females glider doubles as a pouch where they raise their young until they're old enough to fly off
YOU1000000168_S0000086	i mean glide off on their own
YOU1000000168_S0000088	if you're wondering where they got the name it's because they love to eat almost anything that is sweet especially fresh fruit and vegetables
YOU1000000168_S0000090	the best part about these australian natives that they love playdates with their caregivers and get along great with other animals
YOU1000000168_S0000092	four the kinkajou
YOU1000000168_S0000094	kinkajou is are small golden brown honey bears that are native to rainforests and have become increasingly popular as pets
YOU1000000168_S0000095	celebrities such as paris hilton is known to own a kinkajou and a sugar glider but the rich and famous aren't the only ones who find these animals adorable
YOU1000000168_S0000096	no no don't eat that no
YOU1000000168_S0000098	take it just grab it
YOU1000000168_S0000099	making the decision to care for a kinkajou isn't to be taken lightly though as these nocturnal animals like to get into things and can be pretty messy
YOU1000000168_S0000101	three the crusted gecko
YOU1000000168_S0000103	creepy crawly but still kind of cute despite the preferred diet of crickets and mealworms
YOU1000000168_S0000105	the crested gecko has a pretty goofy smile and tiny hands
YOU1000000168_S0000107	just look at them they're so tiny in the eyes well we'll leave it up to you to decide
YOU1000000168_S0000109	but one thing's for sure the crested gecko is one of the cutest reptiles you can own
YOU1000000168_S0000111	their low maintenance care and funny personalities have made them extremely popular pets
YOU1000000168_S0000113	because they're so simple to care for crested geckos make excellent pets for kids and beginner reptile parents
YOU1000000168_S0000115	it is now time for today's subscriber pic we asked our subscribers to send in their pictures for their cutest exotic animals in today's thumbnail pic was sent to us by a subscriber wondering about
YOU1000000168_S0000116	this incredible picture of a small monkey hanging with a human finger so we looked into it and it turns out that it's a finger monkey
YOU1000000168_S0000117	pygmy marmoset that is the smallest primate in the world very close to our number two pick for the list their babies are five to six inches tall in length
YOU1000000168_S0000118	and weighs around one hundred grams these smalls monkeys are indeed the cutest animals in today's video but we cannot include them in our list
YOU1000000168_S0000119	because they are illegal to own in most parts of the world
YOU1000000168_S0000121	two the capuchin monkey
YOU1000000168_S0000123	the cute capuchin monkey is a primate that is often seen in movies and television it is famous for its small size and known for its playful mischievous attitude
YOU1000000168_S0000124	remember jack sparrow's monkey in pirates of the caribbean
YOU1000000168_S0000126	they are highly intelligent territorial and will live up to forty years that's forty years of diapers unless you could teach your monkey to use the toilet
YOU1000000168_S0000128	before we reveal number one be sure to check out other amazing videos on our channel and give us a like if you enjoyed this video so far
YOU1000000168_S0000129	tell us in comments which one of these you liked the most and why
YOU1000000168_S0000131	one the hermit crab
YOU1000000168_S0000133	if your definition of a pet is sweet and fluffy then underwater crawlers probably aren't the first thing that come to mind
YOU1000000168_S0000135	but here is one little critter that can make your aquarium just a little bit cuter not just for its bulging eyes but because of its distinct personality
YOU1000000168_S0000137	unlike most crabs hermits have a smaller soft abdomen
YOU1000000168_S0000139	which they adorably protect by living in an empty snail shell
YOU1000000168_S0000141	they must continue to find larger shells as they grow in size so the owners of these pets must provide progressively larger shells over their lifetime
YOU1000000168_S0000143	creating a very special bond between caregiver and animal
YOU1000000169_S0000001	her eyes and ears were closed for the first two weeks of her life and now opening
YOU1000000169_S0000003	and with this comes a whole new world of sensory stimulation
YOU1000000169_S0000005	she uses her vision to move around
YOU1000000169_S0000007	but does she see the world the same way we do
YOU1000000169_S0000009	well dogs are colorblind
YOU1000000169_S0000011	but that doesn't mean that everything is black and white
YOU1000000169_S0000013	she does see color but mostly just blues and yellows
YOU1000000169_S0000015	it's because she only has two types of color receptors compared to humans who have three
YOU1000000169_S0000017	and it's also why your dog will often ignore an orange toy in the green glass
YOU1000000169_S0000019	as those colors look the same to them
YOU1000000169_S0000021	better to give them something blue
YOU1000000169_S0000023	but it's when things are moving that her vision comes into it's own
YOU1000000169_S0000025	dogs eyes process what they see more quickly than we do
YOU1000000169_S0000027	it's almost like they see in slow motion
YOU1000000169_S0000029	that's why they're always in the right place to catch the frisbee
YOU1000000169_S0000031	psychology professor john pilley was interested in finding out how many words a dog could learn
YOU1000000169_S0000033	and seven years ago he found the perfect student chaser
YOU1000000169_S0000035	using crate load of toys john and his colleagues devise a ground breaking study of k-nine intelligence
YOU1000000169_S0000037	the toys all have names that chaser has learnt through out her life and john picks eight at random
YOU1000000169_S0000039	chase let's pace up chase find punt go get punt right pop pop punt do it girl do it
YOU1000000169_S0000040	yeah linta yeah good girl chase find roach find roach
YOU1000000169_S0000042	find roach i want roach good girl
YOU1000000169_S0000043	john never looks at the toys on the mat so to pick the right object chaser has to actually understand what he's saying
YOU1000000169_S0000045	yeah there's whale pick it up pick it up
YOU1000000169_S0000047	in three years of intensive training chaser has learnt an astounding one thousand and twenty-two words
YOU1000000169_S0000048	that's a hundred and sixteen balls twenty-six frisbees and over eight hundred cloth animals but how does she do it
YOU1000000169_S0000050	on the mat are five items chaser knows and one new one she's never seen a cat that john call meow
YOU1000000169_S0000051	chase find meow find meow find meow do it girl do it do it do it do it girl beat papa
YOU1000000169_S0000052	this task involves highly complex logic the new word isn't in chaser's vocabulary so she has to understand
YOU1000000169_S0000053	that it might refer to an unfamiliar object
YOU1000000169_S0000055	chase give meow i want meow do it girl do it right now
YOU1000000169_S0000057	the way to solve the puzzle is by a process of elimination
YOU1000000169_S0000059	get meow do it do it
YOU1000000169_S0000061	there is meow come here
YOU1000000169_S0000062	after only one trial the new toy and the sound meow are lodged in her brain
YOU1000000169_S0000063	watch meow catch meow good girl
YOU1000000169_S0000065	and it just goes to show that you can teach an old dog new tricks to see african wild dogs in the flesh is a real privilege
YOU1000000169_S0000066	it's thought there may only be three thousand left in the wild making them one of the most endangered mammals in africa
YOU1000000169_S0000068	aladdin the alpha male where's the radio collar
YOU1000000169_S0000070	it really is quite fascinating to watch the alpha pair always together always together
YOU1000000169_S0000071	the male is constantly tailing behind her wherever she goes
YOU1000000169_S0000073	aladdin and feather have only been together for four months but they're already off to a flying start feather is visibly pregnant
YOU1000000169_S0000076	but even though he's now done the job she is pregnant with his pups he doesn't leave her side for one minute
YOU1000000169_S0000078	it's unusual for an alpha male to be so attentive at this stage aladdin seems to be a particularly devoted partner
YOU1000000169_S0000080	taron has been monitoring feather and aladdin's progress from the start so tell me a little bit about how aladdin and feather behaved with each other as the alpha pair
YOU1000000169_S0000081	we've often seen him with his chin resting on her rear end and just following her around and he's been observed sleeping with his paw on her neck
YOU1000000169_S0000082	its typical it's what we call mates guarding behavior he's looking after her he's making sure that she's that she's fed and healthy
YOU1000000169_S0000083	once she's pregnant he continues to follow her even though he's already done his job and fathered her litter
YOU1000000169_S0000084	and i think that's his way of ensuring that his litter of pups survives and and is healthy
YOU1000000169_S0000086	aladdin and feather look like a solid couple
YOU1000000169_S0000088	and that's good news for everyone else in the group
YOU1000000169_S0000090	because as the alpha pair it's their job to provide the pack with new pups
YOU1000000169_S0000092	so is that it are they completely established and their roles are determined and everything's hunky-dory with the whole pack
YOU1000000169_S0000093	well so far so good the the key will be how successful they are at raising that litter of pups as a pack
YOU1000000169_S0000094	and the success of a pack always depends on on the on the reproductive says success so how well they work together to successfully rear their young
YOU1000000169_S0000095	so they're not home free
YOU1000000169_S0000096	not at all not at all
YOU1000000169_S0000097	so whenever you get a new alpha pair it doesn't mean anything until they've successfully reared their first litter oh gosh it's no pressure
YOU1000000169_S0000099	fortunately for aladdin and feather the rest of the group will be there to lend a helping hand
YOU1000000169_S0000100	the other adult females are feather's sisters and the male's come from different packs
YOU1000000169_S0000102	you have to come rest behind us
YOU1000000169_S0000103	it's one big happy family where everyone pitches in
YOU1000000169_S0000105	there are a few places on svalbard where people live year round one of them is the polish research station at hornsund
YOU1000000169_S0000107	they've had bears visit them this year but no fatal run-ins thanks to tried and tested polar bear warning system
YOU1000000169_S0000109	lola that's my daughter's name
YOU1000000169_S0000110	leliana kazlinka has worked at the base for almost a year
YOU1000000169_S0000111	she's the bravest one
YOU1000000169_S0000112	so if a polar bear walks walks in the dogs start barking and scared do they scare it off most times
YOU1000000169_S0000114	dogs like lola bark as soon as they get a whiff of a bear
YOU1000000169_S0000116	this gives the researchers time to come out with a flare gun and scare it off
YOU1000000169_S0000118	for lola here how close has she been to a polar bear
YOU1000000169_S0000119	well she was attacked four years ago
YOU1000000169_S0000120	was she
YOU1000000169_S0000121	yes she had some stitches on her here over here on the leg
YOU1000000169_S0000123	after she was attacked by the polar bear did her attitude change towards him was she more scared
YOU1000000169_S0000124	no she just got more brave
YOU1000000169_S0000125	just almost a job from the polar bears that you've seen come through here have have you noticed that some are more curious that they do have different personalities
YOU1000000169_S0000127	yes yeah some ah are scared once and they go away some are really just
YOU1000000169_S0000129	so starving so so hungry
YOU1000000169_S0000131	i do think it's great the way that the dog senses are used to keep people safe from polar bears they've got an excellent hearing fantastic sense of smell
YOU1000000169_S0000132	and there's absolutely no technology in the world that can detect polar bears as good as a dog can
YOU1000000169_S0000134	it's a small sign of hope there are ways to keep both people and polar bears safe
YOU1000000169_S0000136	max is a red collie cross normally full of energy and enthusiasm
YOU1000000169_S0000137	but in two thousand and eight his owner maureen burns noticed that something was wrong
YOU1000000169_S0000139	i thought at the time max was fading he was nine and a half
YOU1000000169_S0000141	and i was preparing myself for losing him because of he just wasn't happy wouldn't come with me wouldn't sit by me wouldn't sit on my lap
YOU1000000169_S0000143	and the odd signs he would come up
YOU1000000169_S0000145	and touch my breast with his nose
YOU1000000169_S0000147	and back off so desperately unhappy but there's such a sad look in his eyes
YOU1000000169_S0000149	maureen had a small lump in her breast but her latest mammogram was clear so she presumed all was okay
YOU1000000169_S0000151	initially i thought um it's just another lumpy breasts as people get
YOU1000000169_S0000153	but then
YOU1000000169_S0000155	i sort of connected it with the dog with his odd behavior and one day i was looking in the mirror in the bedroom here
YOU1000000169_S0000157	and i looked across in the mirror at max's eyes he was on the bed as he is now and i knew it was cancer
YOU1000000169_S0000159	maureen went to her local hospital but both a scan and a mammogram came back negative
YOU1000000169_S0000161	it took a surgical biopsy to finally detect the cancer
YOU1000000169_S0000163	maureen had it removed and the change in max's behavior was instant
YOU1000000169_S0000165	the day i was picked up from the hospital
YOU1000000169_S0000167	he was his old hyper self again
YOU1000000169_S0000169	he put his nose across my breast to check where the operation had been and he was wagging his tail and his eyes were happy and
YOU1000000169_S0000170	it was unbelievable the change in him instant
YOU1000000169_S0000172	i love max so much and i owe him so much
YOU1000000169_S0000174	and even before i go for a check-up now i get him to check me out and if he's happy and wagging his tail i am happy
YOU1000000169_S0000175	and i know i'm okay
YOU1000000169_S0000177	we now know that dogs like max are smelling the tiny volatile chemicals given off by cancerous tumors
YOU1000000169_S0000179	most dogs can do this they just don't know that we're interested
YOU1000000169_S0000181	but with a little training dogs can accurately pick out a cancerous patient from a selection of urine samples
YOU1000000169_S0000182	good girl good girl
YOU1000000169_S0000184	they can even be taught to let diabetics like steven know that his blood sugar levels are smelling low long before he can feel it
YOU1000000169_S0000185	and definitely before he passes out
YOU1000000169_S0000187	dogs like steven are now transforming lives all over the country
YOU1000000169_S0000188	they're being trained to detect the early warning signals for severe allergic reactions epileptic fits and narcolepsy
YOU1000000170_S0000001	i worked at this place c c w i
YOU1000000170_S0000002	and for my kirk-den current project which was the amoeba operating system which ah i was working under sapa melander
YOU1000000170_S0000003	one of our projects was to write application level utilities
YOU1000000170_S0000004	for this new amoeba operating system
YOU1000000170_S0000005	and so there was an operating system kernel and it was very good at talking to the network
YOU1000000170_S0000006	and it was very good at managing processes but there wasn't much user level software
YOU1000000170_S0000007	there was barely a shell i think that was reported very old unix shells something like the original version unix version sick shell
YOU1000000170_S0000008	but because the file system model on amoeba was so very different
YOU1000000170_S0000009	ah we couldn't take an existing suite of unix utilities
YOU1000000170_S0000010	and so we wanted it to be self-hosting
YOU1000000170_S0000012	and in order to do that we realized we needed a large amount of user level sort of applications utilities tools
YOU1000000170_S0000013	whatever you call it from a from an editor to a mail program to a a login utility and a backup tool
YOU1000000170_S0000014	and one of the things i realized as we had a small team of people sort of working on those things
YOU1000000170_S0000015	that it was very slow going writing all that stuff in c and it wasn't particularly interesting or sort of novel
YOU1000000170_S0000016	or difficult and often we also didn't really care how fast the code ran
YOU1000000170_S0000017	all the reasons why you would write a piece of software in c didn't really apply
YOU1000000170_S0000018	the only reason left was that c was the only lingual language that for which we had a compiler
YOU1000000170_S0000019	there was is a b c language that i had in the back of my mind that would be a much better language to write
YOU1000000170_S0000020	a whole bunch of utility application tools for amoeba
YOU1000000170_S0000021	except that a b c was so high and abstract that it really
YOU1000000170_S0000023	it's it wasn't a good language to talk to servers and file systems and processes
YOU1000000170_S0000024	and it sort of the whole operating system thing was abstracted away from a b c
YOU1000000170_S0000025	it was almost something like it i don't know in the dig in an alternate universe a b c could have become the language of spreadsheets
YOU1000000170_S0000026	it was very good to for talking about a user's data
YOU1000000170_S0000027	and doing all sorts of clever stuff with that data
YOU1000000170_S0000028	and it did that using very sort of general all-purpose data structures like lists and dictionaries
YOU1000000170_S0000029	and of course it had very nice codes structuring devices
YOU1000000170_S0000030	like a small number of simple statements that could be combined in any way you wanted to create other constructs
YOU1000000170_S0000031	the usual function and procedure ah abstractions
YOU1000000170_S0000032	it was not at all an object oriented language although the implementation had some objects sort of shining through
YOU1000000170_S0000033	anyway a b c s
YOU1000000170_S0000035	as it existed still wasn't usable
YOU1000000170_S0000036	but i somehow since i had worked on the a b c project i knew exactly how it was built
YOU1000000170_S0000037	and i had this idea at my head that
YOU1000000170_S0000039	given how much time we had available for our project i could actually build a whole new language designed and implemented from scratch
YOU1000000170_S0000040	given what i learned about both the design and implementation of a b c and start using it to implement our suite of tools
YOU1000000170_S0000041	and still be ahead of the game compared to a situation where we would just have sort of
YOU1000000170_S0000043	quonked on writing the things we wanted to write in c
YOU1000000170_S0000044	for three months
YOU1000000170_S0000046	i i did my day job and at night and whenever i got a chance i kept working on python
YOU1000000170_S0000047	i believe that within three months i was to the point where i could tell people look here this is what i built
YOU1000000170_S0000048	and it had an interactive interpreter loop
YOU1000000170_S0000049	so the the first demos were all let's assign an expression to a variable and print it back
YOU1000000170_S0000051	ah and let's define a small function and call it and let's put some let's put some things in an array and it's rate over the array
YOU1000000170_S0000053	and all those things worked
YOU1000000170_S0000055	ah and
YOU1000000170_S0000057	somehow and i i i don't exactly know sort of how fast this happened but
YOU1000000170_S0000059	certainly my two officemates were almost instantly taken with it and started helping out
YOU1000000170_S0000061	and they and the few others within the institute were very excited about this thing that i'd built
YOU1000000170_S0000063	ah and started sort of
YOU1000000170_S0000065	of course we we didn't instantly use it on amoeba because it wasn't mature enough to actually write the amoeba utilities that we wanted
YOU1000000170_S0000066	but it was already instantly useful enough for our to to run on our unix system
YOU1000000170_S0000067	people within c w i even outside my own department started using it
YOU1000000170_S0000068	and recognizing that it was fun and productive to use and they used it for small scripts
YOU1000000170_S0000069	and people started contributing things like
YOU1000000170_S0000071	bug fixes somehow things went went very quickly during that first year
YOU1000000170_S0000072	because i think by the end of nineteen ninety so a year after i started we developed a plan to do an open source release of this language
YOU1000000170_S0000074	and this was before the word open source had even been coined
YOU1000000170_S0000075	so we didn't call it that but we we did have some models we had like ah
YOU1000000170_S0000077	x-eleven the window system at the time
YOU1000000170_S0000078	ah had a distribution that was one of the the sort of open source examples
YOU1000000170_S0000079	with two colleagues i worked um sort of building a distribution and we we
YOU1000000170_S0000080	actually i it turned out to be very simple
YOU1000000170_S0000081	to gets management to sign up from this release
YOU1000000170_S0000083	that that was an incredibly lucky stroke
YOU1000000170_S0000084	i just sort of
YOU1000000170_S0000086	i asked my manager's manager what shall we do about this
YOU1000000170_S0000087	and he said oh you gotta talk to this and this person in the administrative branch of the institute
YOU1000000170_S0000088	and i talk to this woman and she was like in charge of all legal affairs i believe
YOU1000000170_S0000089	and i said well i have written this source code and i would like to release that and i have sort of
YOU1000000170_S0000090	made up a license that's like identical to the m i t license how could you m i t releases software under exactly this license
YOU1000000170_S0000091	and we just put like the formal name of our institute in there instead of ah the regions of the institute
YOU1000000170_S0000092	she ask me some questions like
YOU1000000170_S0000094	did someone pay for the for this to be developed and i answer was no i i started this started this all in my own my own time
YOU1000000170_S0000095	and it was for this research project that's sort of
YOU1000000170_S0000097	my manager is fine with it
YOU1000000170_S0000099	and so she said sure go ahead and we did it
YOU1000000170_S0000101	and that so that in in february ninety-one we did the first python release
YOU1000000170_S0000103	it it felt like at the time like an incredible milestone we we needed to post it to use net
YOU1000000170_S0000104	there was this use net news group that ah would receive source code for a random free projects
YOU1000000170_S0000105	i got immediately started getting useful positive feedback from well initially just from a random people
YOU1000000170_S0000106	who picked up ah free software from ah use net and
YOU1000000170_S0000107	we we quickly sort of got in to a routine of doing new python releases
YOU1000000170_S0000108	and every time
YOU1000000170_S0000110	i mean there were ah the obvious improvements to the language and the library and bug fixes ah very important category of things that were often contributed
YOU1000000170_S0000111	were ah ports or porting fixes where people had different architectures different compilers
YOU1000000170_S0000112	the the the unix world was much less homogeneous at that time there were lots of small unix vendors that had their own compilers or their own hardware
YOU1000000170_S0000113	all sorts of things so the the big things that happened
YOU1000000170_S0000114	during say the first half of the nineties was a community of python users and developers self-organized
YOU1000000170_S0000115	then came the invitation to come to the united states for ah a couple months
YOU1000000170_S0000117	from nist the national institute for standards and technology so i spent two months there
YOU1000000170_S0000118	ah we organized the first python workshop which was hosted by nist
YOU1000000170_S0000119	through that python workshop i met people who offered me a job and from ninety-five i mean i went back to the netherlands for a few months and then from ninety-five to two thousand
YOU1000000170_S0000120	i worked in u s in northern virginia at the c n r i
YOU1000000170_S0000122	and so there we worked through a lot of growth of the community and the infrastructure we created python website
YOU1000000170_S0000123	ah i got in touch with bunch of people who are still active in the python community like they were so
YOU1000000170_S0000124	i think when i started there python one point three was about to be released
YOU1000000170_S0000126	and then while i was there we released several subsequent versions leading up to one five two
YOU1000000170_S0000127	which for some reason one one five zero was nothing
YOU1000000170_S0000128	but one five two remained the sort of the standard the gold standard of python for a very long time afterwards
YOU1000000171_S0000001	but get back to standardization we are standardizing c plus plus on the i s o rules which are very open process
YOU1000000171_S0000002	people come in there's no requirements for education or experience
YOU1000000171_S0000003	c third develop c plus plus and there is a whole what was the first standard establish what is that like
YOU1000000171_S0000004	ah the iso standard is there committee that you're referring to is a group of people what what is that like how often do you meet what is this
YOU1000000171_S0000005	i'll i'll try and explain that so some time in early nineteen eighty-nine um
YOU1000000171_S0000006	two people one from i b m one from h p turned up in my office and told me i would like to standardize c plus plus
YOU1000000171_S0000008	this was a new ideas for me and ah i pointed out that's it wasn't finished yet it wasn't ready for formal standardizations
YOU1000000171_S0000009	but they said no bjarne you haven't gotten it you you really want to do this um all organizations depend on c plus plus
YOU1000000171_S0000010	we can not ah depend on something that's owned by another corporation that might be a competitor of course we could rely on you
YOU1000000171_S0000011	but you might get run over by a bus
YOU1000000171_S0000013	we really need to get this out in the open it has to be ah standardized under formal rules
YOU1000000171_S0000014	and ah we we are going to standardize it um under i s o rules
YOU1000000171_S0000015	and you really want to be part of it because basically otherwise we'll do it ourselves
YOU1000000171_S0000017	and we know you can do it better ah so ah through a ah combination of arm twisting and ah flattery
YOU1000000171_S0000019	so in late
YOU1000000171_S0000021	in late eighty-nine there was a meeting in d c at the ah actually no it was not i s o then it was n c
YOU1000000171_S0000022	the american national standard would doing
YOU1000000171_S0000024	we met there we were lectured on the rules on how to do an n c standard there was about twenty-five of us there
YOU1000000171_S0000025	which apparently was a new record for that kind of meeting um and um some of the old c guys that has been standardizing c was there so we got some expertise in
YOU1000000171_S0000026	so the way this works is that it's an open process anybody can can sign if they pay the minimal fee
YOU1000000171_S0000027	which is just about a thousand dollars it was less it's a little bit more now
YOU1000000171_S0000028	and ah i think it's twelve hundred and eighty dollar it's not it's not going to kill you and we have three meetings a year
YOU1000000171_S0000029	this is very standard ah we tried two meetings a year for a couple of years that didn't work too well so three week it's three one
YOU1000000171_S0000031	week meetings a year
YOU1000000171_S0000033	and you meet and you have taken what it meet is technical discussions and then you bring proposals forward for votes
YOU1000000171_S0000034	the votes are done one person per
YOU1000000171_S0000036	one vote per organization so you can't have ah say i b m come in with ten people and dominate things that's not allowed
YOU1000000171_S0000037	and these are organization that extensively use c plus plus
YOU1000000171_S0000039	all individuals
YOU1000000171_S0000040	all individuals i mean it's a it's it's a bunch of people in a room deciding the design of a language based on which a lot of the world's systems run
YOU1000000171_S0000041	that's right well i think most people would agree it's better than if i decided it
YOU1000000171_S0000042	or it better than if a singular organization like h n t decide it
YOU1000000171_S0000043	i don't know if everyone agrees to that by the way bureaucracies have their critics too
YOU1000000171_S0000044	yes they they there look standardization is not pleasant it's it it it's horrifying
YOU1000000171_S0000045	take democracy
YOU1000000171_S0000046	but we exactly ah as churchill says democracy is the worst way except for the others right
YOU1000000171_S0000047	and it's about say the same reform standardization but anyway so we meet and we ah we have these votes
YOU1000000171_S0000049	and that determines what the standard is couple of years later we extended this so it became worldwide
YOU1000000171_S0000050	we have standard organizations that are active in
YOU1000000171_S0000052	currently fifteen to twenty countries and ah another
YOU1000000171_S0000054	fifteen to twenty are ah sort of looking then voting
YOU1000000171_S0000056	based on the rest of the world comment and we meet three times a year ah next week i'll be in cologne germany
YOU1000000171_S0000057	ah spending a week ah doing standardization and we'll vote out the committee draft of c plus plus twenty
YOU1000000171_S0000059	which goes to the national ah standards committees for comments and request for changes
YOU1000000171_S0000060	improvements then we do that and thus the second ah set of votes where hopefully everybody votes in favour this is happens several times
YOU1000000171_S0000061	first time we finished we started in the first taken home meeting was in nineteen ninety the last was in ninety-eight
YOU1000000171_S0000062	we voted it out that was a standard that people used till eleven or little bit past eleven um and it was an international standard
YOU1000000171_S0000063	all the countries voted in favour um it took longer with eleven i don't know mentioned why
YOU1000000171_S0000064	but all the nations voted in favour ah and we work on the basis of ah consensus
YOU1000000171_S0000065	that is we do not want something that passes sixty-forty ah because then we are getting gonna dilates it's not improvement in people complain too much
YOU1000000171_S0000066	then they will complain too much but basically it has no real effect the the standards has been obeyed
YOU1000000171_S0000067	they have been working to make it ah easier to use many compilers many computers and all of that kind of stuff
YOU1000000171_S0000069	and so the first they there is traditional with i s o standards to take ten years we did the first one in eight brilliant
YOU1000000171_S0000071	ah and we thought we are going to do the next one in six because now we are good at it
YOU1000000171_S0000072	right
YOU1000000171_S0000073	it took
YOU1000000171_S0000075	thirteen
YOU1000000171_S0000076	yeah it was ah named o x
YOU1000000171_S0000077	it was named o x hoping ah that you would at least get it in within the single within the odds the single
YOU1000000171_S0000078	i i thought we would get yeah i thought we'd get the six seven or eight the confidence of youth
YOU1000000171_S0000079	yeah that's right well the point is that this was sort of like a statement um system effect that is renown you how to do and so we're going to do it much better
YOU1000000171_S0000080	and you got more ambitious and furthermore there is this tendency because its a ten year cycle
YOU1000000171_S0000082	old age doesn't matter
YOU1000000171_S0000084	just before you're about to ship somebody has a bright idea
YOU1000000171_S0000086	yeah
YOU1000000171_S0000087	and so we really really must
YOU1000000171_S0000089	get that in
YOU1000000171_S0000091	we we did that successfully with the s t o
YOU1000000171_S0000093	s t o stuff that that i basically ah i think it's saves you
YOU1000000171_S0000094	plus plus just beautiful
YOU1000000171_S0000095	yeah and then people tried it with other things and it didn't work so well they got things in but it wasn't as as dramatic
YOU1000000171_S0000096	and it took longer and longer and longer
YOU1000000171_S0000098	so after c plus plus eleven which was a huge improvement and ah what basically what most people are using today
YOU1000000171_S0000100	we decided ever again
YOU1000000171_S0000102	and so how to avoid those slips and the answer is that you ship more often
YOU1000000171_S0000103	so that if you if you if you have a slip on the ten year cycle
YOU1000000171_S0000105	by the time you know it's a slip there's eleven years till you get it
YOU1000000171_S0000106	um yeah
YOU1000000171_S0000107	now with a three year cycle there is about three four years till you get it
YOU1000000171_S0000108	like yeah
YOU1000000171_S0000109	the the delay between feature freeze and ah the shipping so we always get one or two years more
YOU1000000171_S0000110	and so we we shipped fourteen on time we shipped seventeen on time and we shipped we will ship twenty on time
YOU1000000171_S0000112	they they don't have any and furthermore this allows this gives a predictability that allows the implementers the compiler implementers the library implementers
YOU1000000171_S0000113	to they have a target and they deliver on it eleven took two years for ah most compilers who good enough fourteen
YOU1000000171_S0000115	most compilers actually getting pretty good in fourteen seventeen everybody ship in seventeen
YOU1000000171_S0000116	wow
YOU1000000171_S0000117	we are going to have
YOU1000000171_S0000119	at least almost everybody ship almost everything in twenty and i know this because they're shipping in nineteen
YOU1000000171_S0000121	predictably this is good delivery on time is good and so yeah
YOU1000000171_S0000122	that's great so
YOU1000000171_S0000123	it's how it works
YOU1000000172_S0000001	okay i'm gonna i'm gonna unbox our own plants
YOU1000000172_S0000002	i just i just got them and not this dog brush my husband just gave me that but i figured let me just do this and show you um the reality
YOU1000000172_S0000003	oh i can't show you my address so i'm gonna have to do it in a way that wait a minute this actually might be some of my clothing
YOU1000000172_S0000005	this is some of my clothing this is clothing that i shipped back from when i was in florida so that's not a plant but this is a plant this is a plant
YOU1000000172_S0000006	so i don't i don't use scissors i use my fingernails and maybe it's cringey for you but that's how i open up tape and i just kind of rip it open like that
YOU1000000172_S0000007	you know i still get excited opening up plants even though i ship a lot of plants oh oh i'm excited
YOU1000000172_S0000009	like i need more plants i do need more plants i was just thinking to myself i need quite a few more plants because when i wasn't here it wasn't here for quite a long time during the pandemic i was in florida and i really couldn't come back home
YOU1000000172_S0000010	so it was really difficult time but at the same time i gave a lot of my plants to friends and family because it wasn't fair that my husband was taking care of them
YOU1000000172_S0000011	so i got rid of them and now i regret it so i have see this is these are four plants in one box and i'm gonna show you what we have
YOU1000000172_S0000012	because i'm excited i kind of know what they are but they will ship to me because i need to have them here because i need plants i need plants
YOU1000000172_S0000013	i need more plants um you can cut the string if you want but i like to not cut the string because i like to use it
YOU1000000172_S0000014	so i just gently release
YOU1000000172_S0000016	the
YOU1000000172_S0000018	cord edge
YOU1000000172_S0000019	and then do that
YOU1000000172_S0000020	and so i just want to reuse these sleeves too so i try to be as careful as i can and pull it from the bottom like this
YOU1000000172_S0000022	let's see okay come on come on you can do this don't rip it and i use my hand and i just oh this is a maidenhair fern
YOU1000000172_S0000023	it's little it's cute and i have some wrap around it that keeps the soil down
YOU1000000172_S0000024	for now we're trying to work on having just all natural materials and we're getting to that point but you can recycle that and then you just take the paper away
YOU1000000172_S0000025	yeah shredded paper because it really helps keep the soil down and this came this showed up pretty nicely ah look at that it's just a couple of little leaves a couple of leaves didn't do so well
YOU1000000172_S0000026	but the soil is nice and moist it still looks pretty good there's just one one little stem that didn't make it that happens sometimes when you get plants in the mail
YOU1000000172_S0000027	but look at that i cleaned it up a little bit to show you the maidenhair fern it traveled pretty well i'm pretty excited about that
YOU1000000172_S0000028	and i'm dirty i'm dirty ah by the way i'm wearing pajama bottoms
YOU1000000172_S0000029	i actually i was wearing a skirt today i don't know what came over me decided i wanted to dress up for whatever reason just because when you don't have to dress up
YOU1000000172_S0000030	sometimes you just wanna do it if you feel like you're maybe you're gonna go someplace kind of exciting i don't know or you're ready to go and someone said hey we've got a very exciting place to go to although it's not really happening right now
YOU1000000172_S0000032	it's just seeing bicolor get off me
YOU1000000172_S0000033	i love dracaena i have i have to transplant one i have this one this is a moon a moonlight this one i've had forever i had to transplant it but that's why it's on the table
YOU1000000172_S0000034	i'll put things on the table that i know i need to do stuff with so you know that's why it's on the table so here's the moonlight i'm just gonna leave that on here for now it's not a moonlight this is a bicolor
YOU1000000172_S0000035	and and we put the bamboo in there so it's just if the box accidentally gets turned over the plant doesn't squish on itself
YOU1000000172_S0000037	here we go it's a bicolor and
YOU1000000172_S0000039	so cute
YOU1000000172_S0000041	i'm kind of into ferns lately i don't know about you because i like a bit of a challenge ferns are a little bit challenging so most i have a blue star fern someplace i think behind me that is doing really really well
YOU1000000172_S0000042	i had fern rabbit rabbit ferns that i don't have anymore and i've got some other ferns and i'm just i'm doing um an unboxing
YOU1000000172_S0000044	it's cold out i know i know i'll be done in a minute okay um
YOU1000000172_S0000046	these are a little bit easier to care for than the maidenhair ferns
YOU1000000172_S0000048	the maidenhair ferns do not like to dry out they really really don't the button ferns can handle a little bit better remember to recycle this is a recycle pile
YOU1000000172_S0000050	reuse it too if you want you can get creative and then remember to remove remove the paper the paper should not stay here
YOU1000000172_S0000051	i'm just making little piles of
YOU1000000172_S0000053	sorry
YOU1000000172_S0000055	i can't take the dirt the dirt's everywhere
YOU1000000172_S0000057	so there's a button fern
YOU1000000172_S0000059	button fern and maidenhair fern and was there anything else in the box those were three there are three plants in that box and i've got one i don't think it's my clothing i think it's a plant
YOU1000000172_S0000060	so
YOU1000000172_S0000062	you know sometimes they don't shut the box doesn't show up in such a pretty condition and so just let us know about that and then we have

YOU1000000173_S0000179	the rollers in front and back are built for mine duty
YOU1000000174_S0000001	this time is the most crucial it's been the entire year
YOU1000000174_S0000003	in the spring it was not that bad here
YOU1000000174_S0000005	we had covid cases but it wasn't like you saw pictures of new york
YOU1000000174_S0000007	today we have a hundred and forty covid patients in a two hundred and thirteen bed hospital i think it's only going to get worse before it gets better
YOU1000000174_S0000009	um she has problem with breathing ah she's not eating
YOU1000000174_S0000010	you know her medical problem at all
YOU1000000174_S0000011	ah she has diabetes severe diabetes and ah high blood pressure
YOU1000000174_S0000012	rosa how many days have you been feeling this way
YOU1000000174_S0000014	she is doing better already okay from when she came in here
YOU1000000174_S0000016	okay you're okay take a deep breath okay we're gonna do everything we can that's what i can promise you okay
YOU1000000174_S0000017	okay
YOU1000000174_S0000019	alright rosa i'm gonna put this one on okay
YOU1000000174_S0000020	so that's a constant battle we're doing that all day long twenty-four hours a day i think if you didn't take it seriously before now is the time to take it seriously
YOU1000000174_S0000022	code blue i c u north at eighteen code blue i c u north at eighteen code blue i c u north at eighteen
YOU1000000174_S0000024	we had this built on friday in anticipation of the surge continuing to peak which on sunday it got there
YOU1000000174_S0000025	our i c u is overwhelmed with patients so we're gonna double bunk them in here
YOU1000000174_S0000026	okay
YOU1000000174_S0000027	normally these patients would be in the icu upstairs but all of those beds are full we created an additional ten beds outside of icu those are all full
YOU1000000174_S0000028	we have six more patients holding in the operating room and then we can hold up to twenty-four more patients in this area
YOU1000000174_S0000029	it is completely full right now as soon as one goes out another one comes in they are all covid positive every single one of them
YOU1000000174_S0000030	so one two
YOU1000000174_S0000031	i need two now
YOU1000000174_S0000032	forty-two okay
YOU1000000174_S0000033	i need three more dividers then right
YOU1000000174_S0000035	everyone's getting sick with covid at the same time so our staff are calling out faster than we can get staff in
YOU1000000174_S0000036	we've received a couple ah traveler nurses from the state of california recently which is wonderful ah but the hard part is is that everyone's fighting for the same resources at the same time
YOU1000000174_S0000038	all of the hospitals in california are struggling
YOU1000000174_S0000040	we have ah the medications we need that the f d a has approved we have convalescent plasma for patients
YOU1000000174_S0000041	we have all the things that we didn't have previously but patients still it is effective but these patients are just sicker it's i don't even know how to explain it um it seems that once we get folks on a ventilator it's really hard to get them off
YOU1000000174_S0000043	where's the a-line straight over this way
YOU1000000174_S0000045	just keep it up
YOU1000000174_S0000047	he's a person happens to be a neighbor of mine we had family friends here we've had people that i've known some people succeed and some people you know
YOU1000000174_S0000048	unfortunately covid is a tragic tragic process so
YOU1000000174_S0000050	i've seen ah approximately ten people that i that i know or that are family friends or neighbors three three unfortunately have passed
YOU1000000174_S0000051	so ah three it's it's it's tough it's tough seeing all that
YOU1000000174_S0000053	there's a lot of weight on the shoulders that we all carry it's it's depressing but we're all hopeful that's the thing i think that we all cling onto hope
YOU1000000174_S0000055	i'm a religious man so i pray while i can go home to my family and i look at them and that's what brings me happiness that's what gets me out of my little depression
YOU1000000174_S0000059	i am very tired today i don't even know what day um in a row we've been working
YOU1000000174_S0000060	ah i've been working twelve fifteen hours everyday as we all have been we're here on weekends we're here on nights
YOU1000000174_S0000061	ah we're watching over each other but you know we're pouring our hearts out to the patients and staff um it's hard i'm tired
YOU1000000174_S0000063	yeah there's still a lot of misunderstanding potentially in the community about how it spreads how people are getting it
YOU1000000174_S0000064	i don't think they realize how hard it is for the families when you see them come in here and hold the hand of their loved that's about to die
YOU1000000174_S0000066	we have done a lot of work around vaccine planning but also realistically it's not gonna be available to community members right away
YOU1000000174_S0000067	this is going to take months it's gonna take months for it to get better
YOU1000000174_S0000069	you need to wear your mask you need to social distance you need to wash your hands
YOU1000000174_S0000070	you really need to follow the science and the guidelines that are being put forward
YOU1000000174_S0000071	we as healthcare workers and caregivers are doing everything we can to keep people safe to take care of them while they're here in the hospital
YOU1000000174_S0000072	but if so many people come in and keep coming in like this it worries me that we're not gonna be able to keep you or any of your loved ones safe any longer
YOU1000000175_S0000000	myths and rumors circulate in a very similar way to the way that microbes spread they can be contagious in that one person hears something
YOU1000000175_S0000001	they pass it on to another person and another and suddenly a rumor becomes really well-established and i think we've always had this problem
YOU1000000175_S0000002	but with the internet and social media just the scale the scope and the speed of it is really amped up i'm doctor seema yasmin and i'm a doctor
YOU1000000175_S0000003	a professor at stanford school of medicine and director of the stanford center for health communication and i'm going to debunk some illness and disease myths
YOU1000000175_S0000005	people kind of want to know like exactly how much water should i be drinking but there isn't that magic number
YOU1000000175_S0000006	i think this myth has been circulating for a long time and somehow eight glasses of an eight-ounce glass specifically is what's circulated
YOU1000000175_S0000007	it depends on your body size and how active you are at a given time
YOU1000000175_S0000009	there is no reason to eat your placenta i do hear from people that they want to eat their placenta
YOU1000000175_S0000010	because monkeys or other wild animals do it but the reason that those it is because they don't want to attract predators
YOU1000000175_S0000011	there is no reason for a human to eat a placenta
YOU1000000175_S0000013	your heart does not skip a beat when you sneeze i think a lot of us grow up hearing things about sneezing that your eyes close
YOU1000000175_S0000014	and your heart skips a beat and you're like a dead for a millisecond or something um yeah clearly not true
YOU1000000175_S0000016	adults have fewer bones than babies and that's actually true because babies are born with some bones that fuse to become a bigger bone
YOU1000000175_S0000018	there is a phenomenon known as the july effect which wonders and asks this question that if you have massive turnover
YOU1000000175_S0000019	new residents starting new faculty starting around july then isn't that a more dangerous time to be in a hospital and there have been three hundred studies looking into this
YOU1000000175_S0000020	and it turns out that it depends on what kind of hospital it is who you're being looked after like how experienced they are but also what kind of illness you are and how seriously sick you are
YOU1000000175_S0000021	the take home from this is that if you're sick in july you still need to go to a hospital and by and large you're in good hands
YOU1000000175_S0000023	so your body makes toxins as it metabolizes different things but the thing is your body also flushes those things out
YOU1000000175_S0000024	you don't need to be doing anything or taking anything to cleanse yourself flat tummy tea is most of them are not good for you
YOU1000000175_S0000025	they kind of go under this umbrella of oh well it's natural or it's herbal but those herbs are no joke sometimes flat tummy teas contain senna
YOU1000000175_S0000026	which yes it's a herb but it's also a laxative so if you wanna crap the weight out i mean all you're doing is emptying your bowels and becoming dehydrated
YOU1000000175_S0000028	your body does have waste products in it that's why you pee and that's why you poop and even when you breathe you are exhaling carbon dioxide which is a waste product
YOU1000000175_S0000029	but your body is perfectly primed to do that to get rid of what you don't need people do ask about colonics you do not need them
YOU1000000175_S0000030	you do not need to put coffee up your butt you don't need to be shoving liquids up there to get anything out unless of course you have constipation and the doctor prescribes an enema but if you're healthy and functioning fine then you don't need to do a colonic
YOU1000000175_S0000032	people are making billions of dollars off dietary supplements that many of us don't need and that includes vitamins
YOU1000000175_S0000033	if you are eating a well-balanced diet you're getting the vitamins that you need and you don't need to be popping a pill to stay healthy
YOU1000000175_S0000034	you need to take a vitamin if your healthcare provider tells you you have a deficiency and you need to top up and take a pill or take a liquid that boosts your level of that vitamin
YOU1000000175_S0000036	m s g is not addictive it's not unsafe and the thing that i was fascinated with when i was writing this was that those myths that you've heard about m s g
YOU1000000175_S0000037	that is addictive that it's really bad for you are all tied to racism and the fact that it was chinese people owning chinese restaurants that were using it and that's how it got labeled as something that was dirty and toxic
YOU1000000175_S0000038	in moderation it's no worse for you than regular salt
YOU1000000175_S0000040	people have asked me if genetically modified food is safe whether they should pay more for non g m o food pay more for organic food but g m o food is safe
YOU1000000175_S0000041	and the definition of organic honestly can be so broad and vague and different from one place to another that most doctors will say
YOU1000000175_S0000042	just eat a healthy balanced varied diet and you don't necessarily need to pay more for organic for most foods
YOU1000000175_S0000044	i do get asked about artificial sweeteners a lot because a lot of my friends like to chug diet sodas the thing to bear in mind here is that some of the studies are not that robust
YOU1000000175_S0000045	so you might have seen headlines saying diet sodas cause alzheimer's disease or diet soda causes stroke
YOU1000000175_S0000046	and they're not necessarily true and the thing that i worry about then is will people ditch the diet soda and just start drinking sugary soda when we know that those are linked to diabetes and other illnesses
YOU1000000175_S0000047	artificial sweeteners the kind that you find in diet sodas do not cause alzheimer's disease
YOU1000000175_S0000049	stroke and cancer you may have seen headlines that say that but i think that they are misconstruing what the scientific studies are really showing
YOU1000000175_S0000050	there have been studies showing some harmful effects of artificial sweeteners in rats
YOU1000000175_S0000051	but then you have to take that with a large grain of salt to say that well just because it did something in a rodent's body will that translate into happening in a human's body
YOU1000000175_S0000052	but if you wanna be really careful you can just drink water
YOU1000000175_S0000055	the great message
YOU1000000175_S0000057	you are a little bit taller first thing in the morning probably no more than a centimeter though and that's just because gravity compresses your joints during the course of the day
YOU1000000175_S0000058	it's also why when astronauts come back to earth after a space mission they are a little bit taller than when they left earth
YOU1000000175_S0000060	there are studies showing that bad teeth especially bad gums can lead to heart disease and make you more susceptible and that's because of the bacteria
YOU1000000175_S0000061	that causes gum disease can circulate through the blood and cause illness elsewhere it's certainly something that makes us look at the patient holistically
YOU1000000175_S0000062	so it's important to get your blood pressure checked and it's important to eat well but it's also really important to get good dental hygiene and get routine checkups to make sure your gums are as healthy as everything else
YOU1000000175_S0000064	there are some studies that are quite exciting that show that aspirin which we already recommend for a number of things might lower the risk of cancer
YOU1000000175_S0000065	but there's still more research being done and there aren't a ton of medical organizations saying hey everyone should take an aspirin pill everyday to prevent cancer
YOU1000000175_S0000066	what we're learning is that it's certain types of cancer in particular and that there might be something about aspirin that prevents metastatic cancer that prevents cancer cells from moving around the body
YOU1000000175_S0000067	but even in that case it might be that the aspirin works for that only in some people and not in everyone
YOU1000000175_S0000068	i get so many questions about aspirin because it feels like every year we discover a new use for it it is an incredible incredible drug
YOU1000000175_S0000069	but the jury's still out on aspirin preventing cancer
YOU1000000175_S0000071	please do not stop taking an antibiotic the moment you feel better if you still have more to complete the course it's really important that if you have ten days of pills
YOU1000000175_S0000072	but you feel better on day four or day three even you still have to finish that course of antibiotics so that the bug does not become resistant to the medicine
YOU1000000175_S0000074	antibiotics cannot help with a cold most colds most sore throats are caused by viruses and antibiotics will not do anything to those
YOU1000000175_S0000075	antibiotics fight bacteria very specifically so if you have a virus circulating in your blood taking an antibiotic will not help
YOU1000000175_S0000077	it's been circulating for ages that you should starve a fever and feed a cold you just need to eat well and stay hydrated when you're not well
YOU1000000175_S0000078	it it is dangerous to starve yourself like that's a thing that we know that's proven so if you have a fever stay hydrated and eat well
YOU1000000175_S0000080	the flu shot can definitely not cause the flu the flu shot might make you achy but for the vast majority of us getting the flu shot is a fantastic idea
YOU1000000175_S0000081	you will not get the flu from it and it will keep you safe
YOU1000000175_S0000083	i think we all grew up hearing that you should never go outside in the cold when your hair is wet or like make sure you bundle up and our mothers loved doing that to us
YOU1000000175_S0000084	during cold times is when there are more cold bugs circulating anyway and also there is some research that shows that cold weather might impact the immune system
YOU1000000175_S0000085	but i don't know if it's that robust i think it's still a good idea though to wrap up very warm
YOU1000000175_S0000087	you do not lose more heat from your head than anywhere else on your body
YOU1000000175_S0000089	you can tell a little bit about what's making somebody sick from looking at the color of their sputum which is the um disgusting thing that you cough up
YOU1000000175_S0000090	for example if it's very clear that's less likely to be an infection usually if it's green or yellow more likely to be a bacterial or viral infection
YOU1000000175_S0000091	i think doctors are good at assessing the color of sputum that people are coughing up out of their lungs if you are emptying your nose into a tissue
YOU1000000175_S0000092	probably looking at the color to try and figure out exactly what bacteria is causing it that's not gonna be something you can assess
YOU1000000175_S0000094	people wonder if their ears stop growing when the rest of them stops growing and actually your ears carry on growing forever
YOU1000000175_S0000096	so the current guidelines in the u s about men who have sex with men can only donate blood if they've been celibate for twelve months which is ludicrous and stupid and unscientific
YOU1000000175_S0000097	it wasn't until two thousand and fifteen thirty years after we had a test for h i v aids
YOU1000000175_S0000098	that gay men and bisexual men were told yes you can donate blood but there was a major caveat
YOU1000000175_S0000099	and that caveat was that men who have sex with men could only donate blood if they had been celibate for twelve months
YOU1000000175_S0000101	vaccines do not cause autism i may get that tattooed on my face at some point in twenty-twenty i'm kind of being sarcastic here
YOU1000000175_S0000102	but if a patient was to ask me that i would take their concerns really seriously and not be dismissive cause i wanna know why they think that and i wanna make sure that i reassure them
YOU1000000175_S0000103	that vaccines are safe and what they cause is a long life and good health
YOU1000000175_S0000105	the best way to disinfect your hands is to wash them very well with water and soap and then to rub them clean
YOU1000000175_S0000107	hand sanitizer's good if you're in a bind but is nowhere near as good as washing your hands with soap and water i get asked a lot of questions about alcohol gel
YOU1000000175_S0000108	hand sanitizer and like disinfectant wipes and they are really useful they do disinfect surfaces
YOU1000000175_S0000109	but nothing is equivalent to disinfecting your hands as washing them with soap and water
YOU1000000175_S0000111	it's true that many patients cared for by a female doctor have better health outcomes there've been a number of studies that show that patients do better
YOU1000000175_S0000112	they live longer they're less likely to be readmitted to the hospital if they're cared for by a doctor who is a woman
YOU1000000175_S0000113	and at the same time women doctors face lots of discrimination and get paid less than our male counterparts
YOU1000000175_S0000115	it's hard to avoid misinformation sometimes there is so much false health news circulating
YOU1000000175_S0000116	and sometimes you can just feel overwhelmed even with the correct information i think the important thing to do is to talk to a healthcare provider that you feel like you can trust
YOU1000000175_S0000117	who has an open mind and someone that gives you the time and space to talk about what's really concerning you
YOU1000000176_S0000001	cells are the smallest living units of an organism
YOU1000000176_S0000003	all cells have three things in common no matter what type of cell they are
YOU1000000176_S0000005	all cells have a cell membrane which separates the inside the cell from its environment
YOU1000000176_S0000007	cytoplasm which is a jelly like fluid and d n a which is the cell's genetic material
YOU1000000176_S0000009	there are two broad categories of cells
YOU1000000176_S0000011	the first category is eukaryotic cells they have organelles which include the nucleus and other special parts
YOU1000000176_S0000013	eukaryotic cells are more advanced complex cells such as those found in plants and animals
YOU1000000176_S0000015	the second category is prokaryotic cells
YOU1000000176_S0000016	they don't have a nucleus or membrane enclosed organelles
YOU1000000176_S0000017	they do have genetic material but it's not contained within a nucleus
YOU1000000176_S0000018	prokaryotic cells are always one celled or unicellular organisms such as bacteria
YOU1000000176_S0000020	so what are organelles
YOU1000000176_S0000021	organelle means little organ
YOU1000000176_S0000023	organelles are the specialized parts of a cell that have unique jobs to perform
YOU1000000176_S0000025	let's start with the nucleus the control center of the cell
YOU1000000176_S0000027	the nucleus contains d n a or genetic material
YOU1000000176_S0000028	d n a dictates what the cell is going to do and how it's going to do it
YOU1000000176_S0000029	chromatin the tangled spread out form of d n a found inside the nuclear membrane
YOU1000000176_S0000031	when a cell is ready to divide d n a condenses into structures known as chromosomes
YOU1000000176_S0000033	the nucleus also contains a nucleolus
YOU1000000176_S0000035	which is a structure where ribosomes are made
YOU1000000176_S0000037	after ribosomes leave the nucleus they will have the important job of synthesizing or making proteins
YOU1000000176_S0000039	outside the nucleus the ribosomes and the rest of the organelles float around in cytoplasm which is the jelly-like substance
YOU1000000176_S0000041	ribosomes may wander freely within the cytoplasm
YOU1000000176_S0000043	or attach to the endoplasmic reticulum sometimes abbreviated as e r
YOU1000000176_S0000044	there are two types of e r rough e r has ribosomes attached to it
YOU1000000176_S0000045	and smooth e r doesn't have ribosomes attached to it
YOU1000000176_S0000047	the endoplasmic reticulum is a membrane enclosed passageway for transporting materials such as the proteins synthesized by ribosomes
YOU1000000176_S0000049	proteins and other materials emerge from the endoplasmic reticulum in small vesicles
YOU1000000176_S0000051	where the golgi apparatus sometimes called the golgi body receives them
YOU1000000176_S0000053	as proteins move through the golgi body they're customized into forms that the cell can use
YOU1000000176_S0000055	the golgi body does this by folding the proteins into usable shapes
YOU1000000176_S0000056	or adding other materials on to them such as lipids
YOU1000000176_S0000058	or carbohydrates
YOU1000000176_S0000060	vacuoles are sac like structures that store different materials
YOU1000000176_S0000061	here in this plant cell the central vacuole stores water
YOU1000000176_S0000063	going back to the animal cell you'll see an organelle called a lysosome
YOU1000000176_S0000064	lysosomes are the garbage collectors that take in damaged or worn out cell parts
YOU1000000176_S0000065	they are filled with enzymes that break down this cellular debris
YOU1000000176_S0000067	the mitochondrion in is an organelle that is the powerhouse for both animal and plant cells
YOU1000000176_S0000069	during a process called cellular respiration the mitochondria make a t p molecules that provide the energy for all the cells activities
YOU1000000176_S0000071	cells that need more energy have more mitochondria
YOU1000000176_S0000073	meanwhile the cell maintains its shape through a cytoskeleton
YOU1000000176_S0000075	the cytoskeleton includes the thread-like microfilaments which are made of protein
YOU1000000176_S0000077	and microtubules which are thin hollow tubes
YOU1000000176_S0000079	some organisms such as plans that are photoautotrophic
YOU1000000176_S0000081	meaning they capture sunlight for energy
YOU1000000176_S0000083	have cells with an organelle called a chloroplast
YOU1000000176_S0000085	the chloroplast is where photosynthesis happens
YOU1000000176_S0000087	it's green because it has a green pigment called chlorophyll
YOU1000000176_S0000089	plant cells also have a cell wall outside of their cell membranes that shape support and protect the plant cell
YOU1000000176_S0000091	animal cells never have a cell wall
YOU1000000176_S0000093	there are many other unique structures that only some cells have
YOU1000000176_S0000095	here are just a few in humans for example the respiratory tract is lined with cells that have cilia
YOU1000000176_S0000096	these are microscopic hair like projections that can move in waves
YOU1000000176_S0000097	this feature helps trap inhaled particles in the air and expels them when you cough
YOU1000000176_S0000099	another unique feature in some cells is flagella some bacteria have flagella
YOU1000000176_S0000100	a flagellum is like a little tail that can help a cell move or propel itself
YOU1000000176_S0000102	the only human cell that has a flagellum is a sperm cell
YOU1000000176_S0000104	in summary remember
YOU1000000176_S0000105	eukaryotic cells are plant and animal cells with a nucleus and membrane enclosed organelles
YOU1000000176_S0000107	while prokaryotic cells are unicellular organisms without these things
YOU1000000176_S0000109	all cells have a cell membrane cytoplasm and genetic material
YOU1000000176_S0000111	and even though only plant cells have chloroplasts both plant and animal cells have mitochondria

YOU1000000178_S0000000	you use the pouring technique to create a lovely pattern on the surface of the drink
YOU1000000178_S0000002	and i'm not even gonna give you guys a chance to get a picture of this because it doesn't match our standards so ah
YOU1000000178_S0000004	hello my name is michael phillips i'm the two thousand and ten world barista champion and the director of education for blue bottle coffee internationally
YOU1000000178_S0000005	and today we're gonna talk about how to make a cappuccino
YOU1000000178_S0000006	now for cappuccino you've got some core ingredients we've got some wonderful coffee today we're using the hayes valley espresso
YOU1000000178_S0000007	you have delicious ice cold milk you've got of course water being pumped into your equipment and you'll have all the tools you need to make that same delicious drink that we make for you in our shops
YOU1000000178_S0000008	one of the defining characteristics of a cappuccino is that it's about a five to six ounce beverage so it's usually nice and proper that keeps the ratio nice and tight
YOU1000000178_S0000009	so the very first step
YOU1000000178_S0000011	is we wanna make sure that our cups nice and hot
YOU1000000178_S0000013	you can add a little water off the machine here this is gonna keep it at a high temperature
YOU1000000178_S0000015	so that it maintains all the heat and we don't have to take our milk to such a high temperature ah which let us keep a little bit more of the sweetness out of it
YOU1000000178_S0000017	the next step we want to get our pop ready so this is referred to as a porter filter you got the basket right here
YOU1000000178_S0000019	this is where you are going to put your coffee that if ground and are preparing to extract
YOU1000000178_S0000020	ah you wanna make sure it's nice and clean and dry which is what we use our porter filter towel for
YOU1000000178_S0000021	and we're really precise about this so we actually use digital scales to measure the weight to make sure we're super specific on it down to the tenth of a gram
YOU1000000178_S0000023	got a grinder here i'm gonna run just a little bit through to make sure everything we're getting is nice and fresh
YOU1000000178_S0000025	so our grinder is gonna dose a timed out version of coffee in here
YOU1000000178_S0000026	but it's probably not as precise as we want so we double check so right now i'm at nineteen point five want to add a little bit more
YOU1000000178_S0000028	and here we go now i'm at twenty-six so i have to use this process this next step is called leveling
YOU1000000178_S0000029	and that's where we shift the coffee grounds around the top of the basket to try and get a nice and even surface
YOU1000000178_S0000030	so the next step you want to compress this bed of coffee down just a little bit
YOU1000000178_S0000031	ah to do that we use this right here this is a tamper
YOU1000000178_S0000032	it's like a chef's knife everybody has one that fits your hand just right
YOU1000000178_S0000033	you want to make sure your porter filter is nice and level you want a line coming straight up from that through your elbow
YOU1000000178_S0000034	and then you compact it
YOU1000000178_S0000036	nice and evenly
YOU1000000178_S0000037	the most important parts is you wanna make sure it's nice and level
YOU1000000178_S0000039	because that's gonna affect how fast the water goes through the various parts of the puck
YOU1000000178_S0000040	so now that we have the porter filter tamped we are ready to lock it in and start pulling your shots
YOU1000000178_S0000042	so we want to get the water out of that cup
YOU1000000178_S0000043	again we've got another scale up here
YOU1000000178_S0000044	ah the three big variables that we pay attention to is the dose so the amount of coffee the yield the amount of stress are going into the cup
YOU1000000178_S0000045	and the time that it takes i've got a little timer right here
YOU1000000178_S0000046	so ah flush a little water through the group head
YOU1000000178_S0000048	lock it in nice and tight and then we're going to pull that shot
YOU1000000178_S0000049	now for the hayes valley um this is a very very tight extraction right
YOU1000000178_S0000050	twenty grams of coffee in for twenty grams of coffee out that's what we would refer to as a reasonably short shot
YOU1000000178_S0000051	ah but we must slow that extraction process down so we're aiming for about thirty to thirty-five seconds over all time to get it to taste just right
YOU1000000178_S0000052	now the time it takes for that to happen is what's really gonna to affect the flavor
YOU1000000178_S0000053	ah low twenty second shot is gonna be a very sour unbalanced shot
YOU1000000178_S0000054	ah for the haze we tend to like something between thirty and thirty-five seconds to get that nice chocolatey really clean flavor
YOU1000000178_S0000055	if you go a little bit longer than that say forty seconds or even higher than that the shots can start to taste excessively bitter
YOU1000000178_S0000057	thirty-three seconds right in the pocket
YOU1000000178_S0000058	so as you can see that is a really nice lovely shot that we have there
YOU1000000178_S0000059	so now that we've got a well-prepared shot that falls into the parameters just the way we want we're gonna steam up some milk and finish up this cappuccino
YOU1000000178_S0000061	now when you're steaming you want to take this steam on tip that has a few little holes in it that hot air jets out through
YOU1000000178_S0000062	and you want to have it right at the surface of the milk in your pitcher because that's gonna let it whip in the air to create the texture that you're looking for
YOU1000000178_S0000063	once you've added the desired amount of texture you're gonna lift that pitcher up ah so that's not whipping in anymore air but it's still bringing that temperature up right into the zone that you want
YOU1000000178_S0000064	steaming is gonna be really quick and it's gonna take about five to six seconds on this on this machine
YOU1000000178_S0000065	whole machines may take a little bit longer but overall this is one of those experiences where most people you know you blink and it's done you wonder what happened do we have it adjusted right there i've got that tip at the surface
YOU1000000178_S0000067	and turn that on
YOU1000000178_S0000068	you hear that air whipping in you don't want to do too much
YOU1000000178_S0000069	and then
YOU1000000178_S0000071	that quick you want to make sure you wipe off your steam wand give it a little purge at the end
YOU1000000178_S0000072	you're gonna give my espresso one more little swirl a really great thing to do after you steamed your milk
YOU1000000178_S0000073	tap it
YOU1000000178_S0000075	on the counter
YOU1000000178_S0000076	and give it a nice swirl we call that polishing
YOU1000000178_S0000077	that's gonna take what was a rougher texture and give it a nice shine so it's got that that white gold like cadillac milk
YOU1000000178_S0000078	and then you can combine the two with latte art
YOU1000000178_S0000079	ah there's a lot to be said about this and it takes some baristas a lifetime to learn really well
YOU1000000178_S0000080	so i'm not gonna try and describe it to you too much i'm just going to show it to you and act like it's a mystic talent that only professionals can develop
YOU1000000178_S0000082	after years of practice
YOU1000000178_S0000084	and that right there is a finished cappuccino
YOU1000000178_S0000086	um
YOU1000000178_S0000088	um
YOU1000000179_S0000001	we're going to explore the concept of charitable giving to see the ways in which you can help make an impact we're also taking advantage of some of the financial and tax benefits
YOU1000000179_S0000003	charitable giving doesn't have to be complicated
YOU1000000179_S0000004	it can be as simple as making donations to your church alma mater or volunteering your time like helping out at the local mission
YOU1000000179_S0000005	giving is most fulfilling when you donate your money or time to a cause you're passionate about
YOU1000000179_S0000006	and studies have shown that when we give it triggers the same chemical reactions in our brains is falling in love or bonding with a newborn child
YOU1000000179_S0000007	besides the obvious emotional benefits you could also end up saving on taxes by giving
YOU1000000179_S0000009	now that you have your mission it's time to think about what goals you want to accomplish
YOU1000000179_S0000010	once you have some in mind put together an action plan on paper that's focused on the different steps you'll take to create an impact
YOU1000000179_S0000012	some things you can include in your plan to help your giving have more of an impact would be to volunteer not just money but skills you may have
YOU1000000179_S0000013	it can also help to commit to a consistent donation over time and to focus on the less glamorous but essential needs the charity may have
YOU1000000179_S0000015	there are over one point eight million nonprofits in the united states so you'll have a lot of choices
YOU1000000179_S0000016	make sure to evaluate the organizations that share your cause to make sure they have strong leadership procedures that will guide their operations and will benefit from your assistance
YOU1000000179_S0000018	giving can be more fun and more effective by connecting with others who share your goals
YOU1000000179_S0000019	getting family and friends involved helps to also reinforce shared values and create stronger connections
YOU1000000179_S0000020	besides benefiting the organizations of your choice your charitable giving can also impact your finances

YOU1000000180_S0000001	mister chief justice ladies and gentlemen we are gathered here today for a ceremony in which we will have sworn in the first head of a new agency i think we have here the best man for this new job that we could find
YOU1000000180_S0000003	and there was a necessity ah for the government at the time to show that it was serious about dealing with pollution problems
YOU1000000180_S0000004	that the federal government was willing to step in where obviously the almost total delegation of the states and local governments ah prior to nineteen seventy ah hadn't gotten the job done
YOU1000000180_S0000006	i came in in mid nineteen seventy-three it was the oil embargo the arab oil embargo and energy was was it
YOU1000000180_S0000007	um during my entire time it was the environmental energy
YOU1000000180_S0000009	conflict if you will in in terms of policy now within the administration in the congress that was pretty crucial and i think the major e p a accomplishment of those years was to keep our programs on track
YOU1000000180_S0000011	in the area of health and safety you have to have regulations and it's important that it be sensible and well managed the legislative job in terms of putting basic authority on the books is done what we now need is the science the information and the follow through
YOU1000000180_S0000012	if you will to get the job done
YOU1000000180_S0000014	the mission for which the agency was established is the protection of the health the welfare and the environment of the american people that is our priority is it is a ah mission to which we are dedicated to which the president is dedicated
YOU1000000180_S0000016	but one that stands out to me was ah concluding the ah montreal protocol ah as a treaty that dealt with a extraordinarily significant environmental issue
YOU1000000180_S0000017	but also a treaty that i think established a framework for dealing with ah international ah environmental concerns
YOU1000000180_S0000019	the clean air act obviously has to ah stand very high on the list of things that ah i think we will ah be proud of and will stand the test of time it was a time when we
YOU1000000180_S0000021	dealt with very high expectations when we crafted a law a lot of the ideas had been in the agency were conceptually developed in the agency they were successfully ah integrated with the the views of other agencies and coordinated very closely with the white house
YOU1000000180_S0000023	who better than your government to protect your air your water and your land it is something that every american should expect of its government that we would do these things
YOU1000000180_S0000024	for you setting tough standards setting standards that protect the people most at risk and then allowing for flexibility in how those standards are met which will allow us to build on the innovation and the creativity that exists in this country
YOU1000000180_S0000026	what we do the methods we discover the solutions we come up with will be prototypes for others
YOU1000000180_S0000027	we will look for ways to work with agriculture and business to find out how we can reach our shared goals of a clean environment in ways that will allow them to continue to supply us with what we need to enjoy our quality of life
YOU1000000180_S0000029	the job is never done we have to get even better at it
YOU1000000180_S0000030	and that's mean that's made been made even more evident by the fact that we now live in a global economy where our country is competing with nations that aren't nearly as environmentally conscious as we have become
YOU1000000180_S0000032	our country has made great strides in cleaning our air water and land in a way that allows our nation to continue to grow and prosper

YOU1000000181_S0000014	that means dao is not far from you dao is within you
YOU1000000181_S0000015	the last part is zouzhi which means to go to move to act
YOU1000000181_S0000017	this is a pretty powerful idea we don't have to rely on an external god through our own actions we can find balance
YOU1000000181_S0000018	now the obvious question is great tell me what is this way but the dao doesn't refer to a thing instead it's the underlying order that governs the universe
YOU1000000181_S0000019	so defining it as a fruitless exercise what is instead is important is to be sensitive to how the universe works and then try and live in harmony with it
YOU1000000181_S0000020	that is what is meant by following the dao and daoist teachings have many guidelines on how to do so
YOU1000000181_S0000021	i've been reading the tai tapu which argues the children's character winnie the pooh is in fact a daoist
YOU1000000181_S0000022	it's a really fun way of getting into the daoist teachings and if you ever read winnie the pooh when you're younger check out the books again i did it recently it's a real nostalgia trip
YOU1000000181_S0000023	in it is a nice story that illustrates what it means to be a daoist
YOU1000000181_S0000024	around a large pot of vinegar crowd three men these aren't any ordinary men in fact they're the three founders of the great asian philosophies
YOU1000000181_S0000025	confucius buddha and lao tzu
YOU1000000181_S0000026	each takes a taste of the vinegar and for confucius it was sour the world was full of degenerate people and corruption and the world was out of step with the way of heaven
YOU1000000181_S0000027	as a result the world was sour what was needed was rules and rituals in order to retain order
YOU1000000181_S0000028	buddha then tasted the vinegar and he had a bitter expression for life was bitter because man's wants and desires led to mass suffering
YOU1000000181_S0000029	and happiness could only be found in leaving this world and entering nirvana
YOU1000000181_S0000030	for lao tzu however he had a smile in his face for daoist's bitterness and sourness only come from the unappreciative and inattentive mind
YOU1000000181_S0000031	i asked master gu how it could be possible lao tzu could keep on smiling when tasting this horrible vinegar
YOU1000000181_S0000032	human being come from nature we must follow the nature's path
YOU1000000181_S0000033	nature itself there's nothing about a sour or bitter
YOU1000000181_S0000034	in the nature the cosmos there is its own natural rhythm path
YOU1000000181_S0000035	never to be too fast not too slow there is you know he has its reason its pace we human being also must find
YOU1000000181_S0000036	finding it recognizing it and following this heavenly way
YOU1000000181_S0000037	so only you depend on you own
YOU1000000181_S0000039	attitude to life
YOU1000000181_S0000040	as a saying goes if you froze life is like a mirror you froze the mirror froze at you you smile the mirror smiles at you that is life
YOU1000000181_S0000041	the a typical dao is never rich yes in their sense because they are mixed with the whole universe whole universe is boundless
YOU1000000181_S0000042	so that's why they are very concerned about live and wear smile
YOU1000000181_S0000044	wouldn't that be awesome to be able to keep on smiling when life sometimes turns sour
YOU1000000181_S0000045	that's the prospect that daoist philosophy offers us it's a set of guidelines for living a contented and happy life
YOU1000000181_S0000046	as many of you will know i started this youtube channel after finishing university i found the time quite difficult i found my my mood to be variable
YOU1000000181_S0000047	and my brain was just overactive so if you're like me and your brain is just a little bit too active or if you've had depression or anxiety or if you're like anyone and you just want to live a contented life
YOU1000000181_S0000048	then my role in these videos is to see how we can apply daoist philosophy to our own lives i don't want this to be me boring you each week i'd love this to be a two way dialogue
YOU1000000181_S0000049	where you guys tell me what you think about the concepts as well as if you have any questions or issues that are personally bothering you master gu and i can see if taoist philosophy can help you
YOU1000000181_S0000050	if you prefer to keep that private then of course you can message me on instagram or facebook but also be awesome to start a youtube discussion as well because then you guys can help each other out
YOU1000000181_S0000051	master gu embodies what it means to be a daoist he's a joyous man he laughs and smiles a lot
YOU1000000181_S0000052	i'm not selling clothes
YOU1000000181_S0000054	despite being fifty plus he's full of energy
YOU1000000181_S0000058	so i'm excited to be able to share with you some of the teachings that are in part responsible for these wonderful qualities
YOU1000000181_S0000060	and the first question for this week is what your knowledge or impressions of daoism is today do you guys know anything about it i'm also starting from almost zero so it's gonna be a learning experience for both of us
YOU1000000181_S0000061	okay that's it guys thanks for watching
YOU1000000183_S0000000	one thing you trying to do is say all these public companies out there here's the company i really like the fundamentals are terrific their earnings are doing well the competitors are doing poorly
YOU1000000183_S0000001	i think this company is doing terrific and all of a sudden the stock might have gone from forty to thirty because of this decline that would say wow here's a chance to buy it
YOU1000000183_S0000002	so you're trying to say some companies might have been overpriced at sixty and all they did was go to fifty and say big deal so you're trying to find companies you liked anyway right now you liked them and now they've had a haircut
YOU1000000183_S0000003	that's what you would do is not is not just like the one from overpriced to fairly priced something was fairly placed at the start of this exercise and then had a very you know a five for sale
YOU1000000183_S0000005	hey guys welcome back to the channel in this video we are going to be talking about some investing lessons that we can learn from peter lynch
YOU1000000183_S0000006	that we can apply for our own investing in two thousand and twenty one
YOU1000000183_S0000007	so we're gonna have a look at an interview from way back nineteen ninety seven a charlie rose interview that peter lynch did and i do have to say a apologies
YOU1000000183_S0000008	some of the cuts in this interview are going to be quite abrupt it's because i don't understand like charlie rose ah he just interrupts peter all the time in this interview
YOU1000000183_S0000009	so i apologize i've tried to do the best i can to get to the meat of the argument because i think the whole interview is about twenty-five minutes so i've tried to chop it down into the best bits
YOU1000000183_S0000010	so with that said let's get stuck into it
YOU1000000183_S0000011	glad to be here
YOU1000000183_S0000012	explain to me what's going on
YOU1000000183_S0000013	well we had a huge run i mean the market was four thousand just you know two and a half years ago it ran up to eighty-three hundred in august
YOU1000000183_S0000014	and you know like any big rally sometimes it backs off i mean it's healthy
YOU1000000183_S0000015	everything is overprice
YOU1000000183_S0000016	yeah and that doesn't help any the market since world war two has sold between ten times earnings and twenty times earnings if you look at the dow jones or the s p five hundred if you add up all the companies and take the earnings
YOU1000000183_S0000017	you see there's a relationship and it follows mcdonald's earnings have been terrific the last thirty years and the stock's been direct there's a direct relationship so the earnings of the s p five hundred have been between this range of ten and twenty
YOU1000000183_S0000018	we were just about to go over the twenty which is the high end of the p e range there wasn't a lot of
YOU1000000183_S0000019	so the p e of twenty is too is is it the top of how high it should ever be
YOU1000000183_S0000020	right it's been over there only a few times ever over twenty and that's when usually inflation's about zero
YOU1000000183_S0000021	so this clip kind of just sets the scene because what peter lynch is describing in this clip is actually what we see today he's talking about how the p e ratio of the market
YOU1000000183_S0000022	generally sits between ten and twenty with twenty really being that upper end well now these days we have discovered what the ultra upper end of that number looks like and it seems to
YOU1000000183_S0000023	and it seems to be
YOU1000000183_S0000025	about thirty now that's kind of scary because what we currently see is a p e ratio for the market at thirty-five
YOU1000000183_S0000026	and it's only been over thirty in three times in history nineteen twenty-nine nineteen ninety-nine and right now
YOU1000000183_S0000027	so there's no question that the market is certainly hot just like the market was hot back when peter lynch did this interview
YOU1000000183_S0000028	back in nineteen ninety-seven but the question we've got to ask ourselves is well how do we go about our investing in this environment
YOU1000000183_S0000029	the decline yesterday in a sense it led off some of this overvaluation the market was even overvalued at where it was right and by letting it off then we got back to what was reasonable
YOU1000000183_S0000030	well you know i would say fairly price made for the larger companies they're now okay there might be some small companies we've had three thousand companies come public the last four years that's two of business day
YOU1000000183_S0000031	some of those companies have gone down dramatically and and that that sort of a research zone that average people in the stock shop that's we can find if if some people know a lot about this ten thousand public companies
YOU1000000183_S0000032	a lot of them are very attractive no one's following them and there's lots of people following i b m
YOU1000000183_S0000034	companies that nobody else followed
YOU1000000183_S0000035	right i'd i'd like to go to see companies with unions or companies in trouble or companies that no one likes
YOU1000000183_S0000036	that have nice beds
YOU1000000183_S0000037	yeah you have to look at a lot of them
YOU1000000183_S0000038	you look panic hose your whiteboard that's the story
YOU1000000183_S0000039	okay you got pure one imports my wife found that one too but but you have to look at twenty to find one it's just you know go to the mall and find the stock i mean you have to say my god this sounds like it's good then you have to do some steps you have to do an organized method
YOU1000000183_S0000040	now that method we'll get to in a second but in this clip peter inadvertently describes exactly how we should be approaching our investing right now
YOU1000000183_S0000041	because today even though the market is really high we're in an environment where actually a lot of businesses are going down
YOU1000000183_S0000042	and what we see is that an index like the s p five hundred is actually propped up
YOU1000000183_S0000043	by literally five to ten really high performing massive behemoth companies
YOU1000000183_S0000044	now what peter's telling us in this clip is to be a great investor even when the market's really overvalued you have to get away from looking at just those massive behemoth companies
YOU1000000183_S0000045	everybody's following these big companies everyone's investing in them and the prices for these big companies all sky high
YOU1000000183_S0000046	so we should be broadening our horizons and looking maybe at the companies that come after the fiftieth largest stock in the s p five hundred
YOU1000000183_S0000047	or maybe beyond the twentieth largest stock in the a s x two-hundred because that's where you're more likely going to find value
YOU1000000183_S0000048	and then the other secret is that of course you just have to keep looking at a lot of businesses
YOU1000000183_S0000049	the best investors are the ones that turn over the most stones right as peter lynch said in this interview you have to look at twenty to find one
YOU1000000183_S0000050	all right with that said now let's have a look at the actual steps that we should all be taking to go ahead and make an investment in this sort of environment
YOU1000000183_S0000051	then you have to do some steps you have to do an organized method people are careful when they buy a toaster
YOU1000000183_S0000053	careful they're careful and buy and see they do they do some research
YOU1000000183_S0000054	but they don't do it with stock they call it the broker they see somebody at lunch and they said man i got this hot stock and you run right out and you spend five thousand dollars small investors
YOU1000000183_S0000055	yeah well even more they put an option in international data which they don't even own international data ware save a ninety day
YOU1000000183_S0000056	but bill said it was good and they make a lot of money
YOU1000000183_S0000057	and it's and it's like a casino so it's like a casino you get the same results as if there's more paperwork
YOU1000000183_S0000058	so this morning you get up and you go in and you look at at those companies had search that
YOU1000000183_S0000059	that you know something about you have to have an itch maybe let's say the cement industry goes from crummy to semi-crummy to fairly good the stocks are going north
YOU1000000183_S0000060	you're gonna make money that's the industry you know when if you know the publishing industry you're you some people have you have an edge you work i mean one of your last thirty years
YOU1000000183_S0000061	you worked at the restaurant as you would have seen taco bell you would have seen some barrels you would have seen pizza hut you've seen chili's you've seen these companies doing very well you should have bought those instead of trying to buy biotechnology stuff you know nothing about
YOU1000000183_S0000062	i mean i know nothing about local area networking lot of people are buying this cisco they're buying the equipment saying we're going to root together all these peripherals and put together the servers
YOU1000000183_S0000063	they but but that's not a bad buy because they own a huge percentage of their market
YOU1000000183_S0000064	you know what that was they're saying only a few people had that way my god if it works for us other people try it then colleges will try it high schools will try it they'll go overseas they knew they were early in the ball game
YOU1000000183_S0000065	and they should have been buying that company instead of out buying something they don't know anything about some oil drilling company i'm feel it this tendency to always buy something they don't
YOU1000000183_S0000066	all you need's okay charlie all you need is a few good stocks okay
YOU1000000183_S0000067	this is your song this has been your sing from a long time here's by what you know
YOU1000000183_S0000068	now but people wake up in the morning and say this there's five thousand companies out there which one should i buy the the average person ought to be able to follow four or five companies there would be a lecture on them they understand the companies
YOU1000000183_S0000069	and this forces you this tool says to you right down the
YOU1000000183_S0000070	have you keep saying this this
YOU1000000183_S0000071	so that makes sense you have to start with obviously going ahead and doing some research you know he says people do a lot of research when they go to buy a toaster
YOU1000000183_S0000072	why isn't it that people do a lot of research when they go to buy a stock you know don't treat the stock market like a casino
YOU1000000183_S0000073	and then when you actually do sit down to learn about some companies look at the companies that are really relevant to you
YOU1000000183_S0000074	warren buffett would use the phrase stick within your circle of competence peter lynch's example here is you know if you're someone that works in the restaurant the restaurant industry
YOU1000000183_S0000075	look at pizza hut look at taco bell their companies that you probably already understand to quite a high level
YOU1000000183_S0000076	and don't go messing around with you know these biotechnology companies that nobody understands so once you find those companies that resonate with you then you go in you do that research
YOU1000000183_S0000077	and as peter lynch says you only need four to five good stocks in like a decade warren buffet would argue you need even less than that
YOU1000000183_S0000078	but you should know those companies well enough to be able to give a lecture on their business
YOU1000000183_S0000079	so that's really the first step first step is to stay within your kind of circle of competence second step go in and understand those businesses in depth
YOU1000000183_S0000080	and then after that what happens next well let's listen in
YOU1000000183_S0000081	one thing you're trying to do all these public companies out there here's the company i really like the fundamentals are terrific their earnings are doing well the competitors are doing poorly
YOU1000000183_S0000082	i think this company's doing terrific and all of a sudden the stock might have gone from forty to thirty because of this decline that would say wow here's a chance to buy it
YOU1000000183_S0000083	so you're trying to say some companies might have been overpriced at sixty and all they did was go to fifty and say big deal so you're trying to find companies you liked anyway
YOU1000000183_S0000084	right now you like them and now they've had a haircut that's what you would do you're not not just like the one from overpriced to fairly priced something was fairly placed at the start of the exercise
YOU1000000183_S0000085	and then had a very you know a five for four sale
YOU1000000183_S0000086	if you had been managing the magellan fund this morning you would have been buying like crazy
YOU1000000183_S0000087	i would have been researching like crazy i would been saying which companies are the same story is there anything really happening this is a non-event for them they're still doing well inner fully have a recession
YOU1000000183_S0000088	there's nothing do with them and that's the kind of kinds i'm trying to buy but let's say if a company just think of this as being you say to yourself i think this company's gonna earn something in the future
YOU1000000183_S0000089	if it's already discounting that if it's selling at a huge multiple you say it's already it has to work and then it's only going to stay even
YOU1000000183_S0000090	so you have to say yourself if i'm right how much i gonna make if i'm wrong how much i gonna lose that's the risk reward ratio in stock shop we talk about if i'm right i hoping to double trip my money if i'm wrong
YOU1000000183_S0000091	may i lose thirty forty percent that's a favor ratio you say if i'm right the stock's not going to go up i already discounting terrific things if discounting terrific things are in the stock how do i know
YOU1000000183_S0000092	okay so first step is to find a company where you've got the edge the second step is to really understand the business understand the financials understand the fundamentals
YOU1000000183_S0000093	but then what peter lynch talks about in this environment where basically everything's overvalued what you want to do is you want to try and find companies that are just fairly valued
YOU1000000183_S0000094	even in this extreme overvalued environment because as investors what we do is we buy undervalued stocks right we always buy at a discount to intrinsic value
YOU1000000183_S0000095	that's how we know we make money in the long run now if you find a company that's really great but it's also really expensive in this environment
YOU1000000183_S0000096	and then there's some sort of you know ten fifteen market dip and it brings the stock back down to fair value well then remember you're still it's still like paying
YOU1000000183_S0000097	full retail for that stock so what we're looking for is great businesses that in this overvalued environment are just fairly value
YOU1000000183_S0000098	so if anything does happen suddenly in the market something causes a ten percent dip or a fifteen percent dip then all of a sudden that business goes from being a fair value
YOU1000000183_S0000099	to now being undervalued so they're the kind of situations we're looking for imagine this the new xbox one x console full retail
YOU1000000183_S0000100	price i think is seven hundred and fifty australian dollars if you went into say
YOU1000000183_S0000102	e b games and they were selling that xbox for you know that it was a thousand dollars and now it's dropped down to seven hundred and fifty
YOU1000000183_S0000103	you're not getting excited by that deal because it's just come back down to full price but if that same store was offering you know it started at seven hundred and fifty full retail
YOU1000000183_S0000104	and then it dropped down to five hundred well obviously that's a much better deal exactly the same thing with businesses in the stock market
YOU1000000183_S0000105	and just quickly the other thing to note from what peter lynch said in this little clip was when he said ah if a stock is trading at a huge multiple it basically has to work
YOU1000000183_S0000106	right and if it does work out then you're still just even now even today what we're seeing is some companies they might be great companies but they're trading at p e ratios in hundreds
YOU1000000183_S0000107	if not literally the thousands like some companies for instance like tesla i think has a p e ratio of one thousand three hundred
YOU1000000183_S0000108	now what this means is it means that the price that investors are paying today this is already they are expecting flawless continued growth
YOU1000000183_S0000109	for years and years and years to come that's what the share price is telling us now if you invest in a company like this at these prices
YOU1000000183_S0000110	then there's very little room for upside and there's a whole lot of room for downside because investors right now are already expecting years and years and years of perfection
YOU1000000183_S0000111	right of absolutely perfect execution as peter lynch says you have to factor in if i'm right how much am i going to make
YOU1000000183_S0000112	and if i'm wrong how much am i going to lose and that's a very in there is a very important couple of questions to ask yourself before buying into a stock
YOU1000000183_S0000113	and that's where you go back to your discounted cash flow analysis and you look at the growth rates to figure out what that risk ratio is for the company that you're looking at
YOU1000000183_S0000114	what you're saying to people today about the future of the market over the near term is what what's your feeling
YOU1000000183_S0000115	we can take a coin out and flip it i have no idea with what next thousand points gonna do
YOU1000000183_S0000116	the next six thousand points gonna be up the next fourteen thousand we have the next twenty thousand we have
YOU1000000183_S0000117	but you don't know what next thousand would be
YOU1000000183_S0000118	nobody does nobody does
YOU1000000183_S0000119	in in it's few top to trying guess it cooperate profits could be lot hot ten years from now or be lower hot twenty years from now that's which go to rely on
YOU1000000183_S0000120	the third key step the peter lynch try a lots in this clip is always focus on the long term
YOU1000000183_S0000121	don't be worried about what the market would do next week next month or even next year what you should really be focused on is what is this company going to look like five years from now
YOU1000000183_S0000122	in ten years from now always focus on the long term because if you can do that then short term market fluctuations they really don't mind that
YOU1000000183_S0000123	and you just don't stress about them at all in fact when prices go down you get excited you don't get scared
YOU1000000183_S0000124	as paddling have says in the corporate profits will be hotter than ten years from now there will be hotter than twenty years from now and that's what you have to rely on so
YOU1000000183_S0000125	we rely on the fact that yes business is going to continue to prove it no maybe not over next two years maybe we sold the lock down where business is impaired for a whole year or two
YOU1000000183_S0000126	it's still doesn't matter to us because we look for situations will what's gonna happen over five years what's gonna happen over ten years
YOU1000000183_S0000127	and if that situation is favorable that's when we win this
YOU1000000183_S0000128	what about all the criticism have we are ribbed it if then and the impact vein have had
YOU1000000183_S0000129	that's what complicated me yeah
YOU1000000183_S0000130	all i know was i mean i don't know it's way of my head and everybody to ask question in my life i know but you i times on your side when you are on stock you know i don't know about but you know three percent down buying in the future and scrap and scrap let's wear my hat
YOU1000000183_S0000132	alright so you are optimistic about the future of the american economy earnings potential for most well run company will do all right
YOU1000000183_S0000133	but people have to understand with it nine recessions of world war two
YOU1000000183_S0000134	we'll have other recessions
YOU1000000183_S0000135	not in one nail
YOU1000000183_S0000136	but we may have one when the future and don't get worry about it'll have one sometime we will have one and well no one would tell you once that gonna happen it's
YOU1000000183_S0000137	well well the one the fundamental was tell you
YOU1000000183_S0000138	no you'll find out after the fact you all of sudden you'll notice is order slowing prices get more competitive than earns it down i mean usually find out after that no one declare urban's insane we're gonna have recessions for five years just hasn't happen
YOU1000000183_S0000139	it's great to see you you can come back anytime
YOU1000000183_S0000140	you know i really like this last clip from peter lynch it's just a lesson you don't have too fancy right you don't have to drift into things that you don't understand like a lot of stocking investors
YOU1000000183_S0000141	they are just all over options peter lynch is the first put his hand up says look a love investing companies i don't have a clue what's going on what comes to options never bought an option in my life
YOU1000000183_S0000142	so you know step one find the business is your you know you understand
YOU1000000183_S0000143	step two you know make sure that you can make sure you are looking at fairly value business that they can go under valued
YOU1000000183_S0000144	step three focus on the long run find solid business with low death high cash flows and just keep focused on that stuff because that's the winning formula you know
YOU1000000183_S0000145	we are going to see recessions in the future we've seen recessions in the past it could happen tomorrow it could happen next week it could happen in a years of time or five five years from now
YOU1000000183_S0000146	but the main thing is the strong companies with solid cash flows that you understand that you going to hold for a long period of time
YOU1000000183_S0000147	there is the ones that it going to make it through and there is ones we should be ultra focused on in any socket of the environment so
YOU1000000183_S0000148	anyways guys i hoped you enjoy this video um i always like listening to what peter lynch has to say even in his really really old interviews ah this is from nineteen ninety-seven and yet
YOU1000000183_S0000150	just because mark was high then mark is high now everything that is saying is almost directly applicable into what we doing with their investing today
YOU1000000183_S0000151	and i love it i love it when we can draw those kind of parallels just like poetry
YOU1000000183_S0000153	anyways guys hope you enjoy the video
YOU1000000183_S0000154	leave a like on it if you did subscribed the channel if you not down so already
YOU1000000183_S0000155	and make sure you check out portfolio links down to description below if you likes one of the hell i go about my investing if you'd like to learn about
YOU1000000183_S0000156	you know a lot of key points in peter lynch's strategy in much more detail and kind of like step by step
YOU1000000183_S0000157	and feel free to check out ah introduction to stock analysis the that loading me fourth way goes thank you guys very much for watching and i'll see you all in the next video
YOU1000000184_S0000001	i'm bob klein from los angeles i wonder if you could give us a glimpse into your investment process the way you approach looking at a particular industry and i wonder if you could use real estate as an example
YOU1000000184_S0000002	i know real estate hasn't been a big huge part of berkshire's portfolio over the years and i wonder if that's because you view real estate as a commodity business
YOU1000000184_S0000003	or if maybe the cash flows from real estate tend to be more predictable than perhaps from some other industries
YOU1000000184_S0000005	ah it tends to be less likely to be mispriced and and therefore less likely to find terrific bargains in real estate
YOU1000000184_S0000006	so
YOU1000000184_S0000007	go ahead
YOU1000000184_S0000008	so just wondering if we could um if if we were watching a discussion between you and charlie hashing out ah the merits of real estate how how it would go
YOU1000000184_S0000009	well it would go like all our other conversations she would say no for about fifteen minutes and then
YOU1000000184_S0000011	and i was engaged by the the by the degree to which the emotion he put into his notes whether you really like the deal or not
YOU1000000184_S0000013	the ah
YOU1000000184_S0000015	we we both had a fair amount of experience in real estate and charlie made his early money in real estate um
YOU1000000184_S0000016	the second point is the more important point is that real estate is not a commodity but
YOU1000000184_S0000018	it i think it tends to be more accurately priced
YOU1000000184_S0000019	critically developed real estate more accurately priced most of the time
YOU1000000184_S0000020	now during the r t c period when you had huge amounts of transactions and you had a you had an owner that didn't wanna be an owner in a very big way and they didn't know what the hell they owned and all that sort of thing
YOU1000000184_S0000021	i mean you had a lot of mispricing then and i know a few people in this room that made a lot of money of that ah but
YOU1000000184_S0000023	under
YOU1000000184_S0000025	most conditions it's it's hard to find real estate that's really mispriced i mean when i look at when i look at the transactions that we can engage in currently and you get a lot of information on that sort of thing
YOU1000000184_S0000026	you know they're they're very similar
YOU1000000184_S0000028	but it's a competitive world and
YOU1000000184_S0000029	and you know they all know about what a class a office building and you know in chicago or wherever it may be is gonna produce at least they have they may all be wrong as it turns out because of some unusual events but
YOU1000000184_S0000030	but it's hard to argue with the current conventional wisdom most of the time in the real estate world
YOU1000000184_S0000031	but occasionally there there have been some you know there there could be big opportunities in the field but if if they exist
YOU1000000184_S0000033	it will certainly be because there's a there'll probably be a lot of chaos in real estate financing for one reason we've done some real estate financing and ah
YOU1000000184_S0000035	you have to have the money shut off
YOU1000000184_S0000037	to quite a degree probably to get any big mispricing ah across the board charlie
YOU1000000184_S0000039	yeah we we don't have any
YOU1000000184_S0000041	competitive advantage over experienced real estate investors in the field
YOU1000000184_S0000043	and we wouldn't have if we were operating with our own money as a partnership
YOU1000000184_S0000045	and if you operate as a corporation such as ours which is taxable under
YOU1000000184_S0000047	chapter c of the internal revenue code you've got a whole layer of corporate taxes
YOU1000000184_S0000048	between the real estate income and the use of the income by the people who own the real estate so
YOU1000000184_S0000050	by its nature real estate tends to be a very lousy investment for people who are taxed under sub-chapter c of the ah code relating to corporations so the combination of having it
YOU1000000184_S0000052	generally allows the activity for people with our tax structure and having no special competence in the field
YOU1000000184_S0000053	means that we spend almost no time thinking about anything in real estate and then such real estate as we've actually
YOU1000000184_S0000055	done like holding surplus
YOU1000000184_S0000057	i'd say we have a poor record that
YOU1000000184_S0000059	yeah c corps really does it doesn't make any sense ah i mean i know there are c corps around that that are in real estate but there are other structures that are more attractive there really aren't other structures
YOU1000000184_S0000060	ah i mean lloyd's is an attempt at it to some degree but there aren't other structures that work well for big insurance companies or i mean you can't have a walmart very well that does not exist in a c corp
YOU1000000184_S0000061	they are not subject to s corp or partnership competition that determines the returns on capital in in in in the discount store field
YOU1000000184_S0000062	but if you're competing with s equivalent of s corps
YOU1000000184_S0000064	ah or partnerships or individuals
YOU1000000184_S0000065	you you've just got an economic disadvantage ah as a c corp which is for the those of you who don't love reading the internal revenue code
YOU1000000184_S0000067	corporation that you think of all of the dow jones companies all of the s and p companies and so on
YOU1000000184_S0000069	and the ah the
YOU1000000184_S0000071	as charlie says it's unlikely that that the disadvantage of our structure combined with the competitive nature of people with better structures buying those kinds of assets will ever lead to anything
YOU1000000184_S0000072	really interesting although i would say that we missed the boat to some extent during the r t c days i mean ah
YOU1000000184_S0000074	it was a sufficiently inefficient market at that time and there was a lack of financing that ah we we could have made a lot of money if we had been geared up for it at that time
YOU1000000184_S0000075	we we actually had a few transactions that were pretty interesting but not but nothing that was significant in relation to our total capital
YOU1000000184_S0000076	we thought significantly about buying the irvine corporation when it became available so
YOU1000000184_S0000078	but that's the only big one i can remember that we seriously thought about
YOU1000000184_S0000080	yeah that that was in nineteen seventy-seven
YOU1000000184_S0000082	yeah ah mobile oil was interested in you know don brent ended up putting together a report but you know that kind of thing
YOU1000000184_S0000084	could conceivably happen but but ah it's unlikely
YOU1000000185_S0000001	hello everyone and welcome to a very special edition of the u s chamber foundation's path forward series
YOU1000000185_S0000002	if you've been a regular viewer welcome back if you're new to the series thank you for joining us we hope you find it both informative and interesting
YOU1000000185_S0000003	and boys did you pick a great week to tune in over the past few months we've been bringing together experts in a number of critical fields
YOU1000000185_S0000004	all around the topic of returning to work today we're thrilled to be joined by two of the most impactful philanthropists in the world
YOU1000000185_S0000005	bill and melinda gates have dedicated their lives to advancing science and improving public health among other initiatives
YOU1000000185_S0000006	the u s chamber foundation has a deep relationship with the gates foundation
YOU1000000185_S0000007	for more than a decade we've worked together on both k through twelve and post-secondary education reforms
YOU1000000185_S0000008	we've value their partnership and we're very pleased to have bill and melinda gates with us here today
YOU1000000185_S0000009	as you'd likely seen a few years ago bill brought attention to the risks of a deadly global pandemic sadly his warning is now our reality
YOU1000000185_S0000010	the good news is that he and melinda have committed themselves and their organization to finding a solution and that gives us all a sense of hope
YOU1000000185_S0000011	the bill and melinda gates foundation has committed more than three hundred million dollars to the global covid-nineteen response
YOU1000000185_S0000012	we're so grateful for their leadership during this trying moment and excited to talk to them today
YOU1000000185_S0000013	this episode was pre-recorded to fit their busy schedules so there won't be audience questions at the end this time but there's a lot that we get to talk about and so let's get to it
YOU1000000185_S0000015	well thank you very much for being with us we have so many questions but i just want to jump right in and so let me ask you both
YOU1000000185_S0000016	what is the gates foundation doing to fight the corona virus and and why is it such a priority for you
YOU1000000185_S0000018	our foundation ah has a
YOU1000000185_S0000020	big focus on infectious diseases that you know kill ah millions of people primarily in developing countries
YOU1000000185_S0000021	and so in our understanding about how you design a vaccine we funded a lots of new vaccines
YOU1000000185_S0000022	ah we're partnering gobby which actually buys vaccines for developing countries and we have a lot of the expertise that's not in the private sector to pick
YOU1000000185_S0000023	which of these we should build factories for and how we coordinate all this activity and so it's become a huge ah focus for us
YOU1000000185_S0000024	and of course the benefit of getting the vaccine you know even three or four months earlier ah ah will be very dramatic in terms of ah ending needs
YOU1000000185_S0000025	awful economic effects as well as the ah death and disease
YOU1000000185_S0000027	melinda when do you think we'll see a vaccine at scale and and a two part question
YOU1000000185_S0000028	because you've also talked um beautifully about the need to have an equitable distribution of a vaccine so kind of when do you see this at scale and what can we do to make distribution equitable
YOU1000000185_S0000029	yes i think we all believe that just seeing the various vaccine candidates that are coming through the pipeline there are three that are looking quite promising luckily
YOU1000000185_S0000030	and i think we all believe that by twenty twenty-one we will have a vaccine
YOU1000000185_S0000031	um we're working ahead of time with them with the manufacturers with the pharmaceutical companies to try and actually have manufacturing capability ready to go
YOU1000000185_S0000032	so that soon as those trials are finished the vaccine can go immediately into manufacturing
YOU1000000185_S0000033	and the whole reason we got involved in this vaccine was to make sure there's equitable distribution
YOU1000000185_S0000034	the last thing you want is a bidding war between countries for this vaccine you know we know there are sixty million healthcare workers around the world
YOU1000000185_S0000035	who are keeping everybody safe they deserve to get this vaccine first and from there you wanna do tearing in various countries
YOU1000000185_S0000036	to make sure your most vulnerable populations get it ah in in our country that would be blacks and native americans people with underlying health conditions and the elderly
YOU1000000185_S0000037	and so we need to look at as a globe and we're involved with many european leaders um and african leaders and others in southeast asia to make sure
YOU1000000185_S0000038	there's a purchasing fund that can hold that vaccine through when it's available and get it out in wide scale distribution
YOU1000000185_S0000040	gosh i have so many follow-up questions i'll try to stay focused so um let me go back to bill for a second you got widespread attention for prediction you made in twenty fifteen
YOU1000000185_S0000041	about the dangers of a global pandemic and you sadly for the world did predict the future and so let me ask you to do it again you know what are you concerned about now
YOU1000000185_S0000043	well this won't be the last pandemic that we face you know pandemics can come from ah natural causes
YOU1000000185_S0000044	ah which is largely coming across from other species you know a flu for example ah is still a very big risk
YOU1000000185_S0000045	and so we'll have to invest
YOU1000000185_S0000047	in making sure that we catch the disease sooner and that we have platforms to make diagnostics therapeutics and vaccines very quickly
YOU1000000185_S0000048	very little was invested even though there were these calls by ah a lot of people including our foundation
YOU1000000185_S0000049	ah one group that was funded the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations cepi c e p i
YOU1000000185_S0000050	ah we welcome france norway u k japan were the initial funders and that is helping out here
YOU1000000185_S0000051	ah so we're better off than if that hadn't happened ah but you know people trust government to think through
YOU1000000185_S0000052	these eventual bad things ah this was a a failure ah to to get ready
YOU1000000185_S0000053	and the cost would have been tiny compared to say what we spend on ah being ready for war we didn't actually do the simulation to think about
YOU1000000185_S0000054	okay what about nursing homes what about getting factories ready what about the testing machine
YOU1000000185_S0000055	you know in fact the testing could have been ramped up ah very quickly in a few countries that have almost avoided the epidemic entirely like
YOU1000000185_S0000057	ah taiwan new zealand and australia you know they took their experience and actually prepared and so they moved a lot faster ah
YOU1000000185_S0000058	so we
YOU1000000185_S0000060	you know we'll have to prepare for the next one that
YOU1000000185_S0000062	you know i'd say is ah will get attention this time
YOU1000000185_S0000064	so you know that reminds me of going back to the vaccine melinda and i promise to move off of it but you know we've never had a vaccine for a coronavirus
YOU1000000185_S0000065	and that makes people nervous about this time so i think the audience will be so pleased to hear your optimism for this right but
YOU1000000185_S0000066	what do you think is different this time that makes us think the development will happen is it this global coordination
YOU1000000185_S0000067	it's this it's the pharmaceutical companies working together with scientists from all over the globe ah in a very coordinated fashion
YOU1000000185_S0000068	we have never seen ah the companies come together in this way and also to be thinking ahead about manufacturing
YOU1000000185_S0000069	and manufacturing not just for their own country or their own region but for other places in the world and so that's what makes us optimistic is the many many conversations that we're having
YOU1000000185_S0000070	ah the way we're seeing the scientists move forward with the data as soon as they get it um and also seeing global leaders come together
YOU1000000185_S0000071	like the european commission did a huge pledging event for this vaccine alliance that we've been part of and seeing money come together to say
YOU1000000185_S0000072	we need this so that it's ready when the vaccine is ready to go we can actually purchase that vaccine for the rest of the world
YOU1000000185_S0000074	and do you think ah bill the same thing is true on therapeutics and testing i mean do you think that the way that things are coming together will get us where we need to be
YOU1000000185_S0000075	on the other sides of the equation as well
YOU1000000185_S0000077	well people are caught a little bit flat footed in that usually the u s is very well organized ah so the you know
YOU1000000185_S0000078	this new drug that got proven out that's a a trial network we funded with others with welcome trust in the u k ah
YOU1000000185_S0000079	you know usually you expect the u s to do good coordinated trials and you know to pick drugs for their scientific merit
YOU1000000185_S0000080	ah the world has had a little bit of a hard time when the the u s testing thing ah went in the wrong direction
YOU1000000185_S0000081	ah when it hasn't been a you know a federal notion of how you prioritize things but i have to say the european are are filling that vacuum particularly in terms of caring
YOU1000000185_S0000082	for the entire world their generosity has been ah quite good ah you know people hope that the u s comes back ah
YOU1000000185_S0000083	although you know withdrawing from w h o's is a step in the opposite direction but historically the u s you know we did smallpox eradication
YOU1000000185_S0000084	rotaries been behind ah ah the polio progress that we've made which is done through ah w h o
YOU1000000185_S0000085	and you know a substantial part of the u s money is ah that goes there is for that polio eradication and so you know there's still a chance for the u s
YOU1000000185_S0000086	to contribute ah on this and you know not just thinking of itself but also ah in the same way we did
YOU1000000185_S0000087	and particularly president bush and pepfar did ah helping out the entire world
YOU1000000185_S0000089	you know you've both been really vocal about the need to make this a global response and to help people outside of our borders
YOU1000000185_S0000090	so if you were talking to in this audience a small businessperson in in the middle of the country somewhere who might not understand that
YOU1000000185_S0000091	explain why you think it's so important that we reach beyond our borders and help control this virus
YOU1000000185_S0000092	well i think you know covid anywhere is covid everywhere and so for a small business owner
YOU1000000185_S0000093	you know the supplies that come in that help you run your business don't all necessarily come from the united states
YOU1000000185_S0000095	and your customers probably aren't all just u s customers and so if we want to have global trade and global supply chain
YOU1000000185_S0000096	and global manufacturing we have to get the whole world coordinated in its response to this disease because it's not going to be able to be contained
YOU1000000185_S0000097	in one or two places even once we've gotten it outside of the u s borders
YOU1000000185_S0000098	yeah and to put it in perspective the u s has spent trillions of dollars to try and deal with the problem here we're only talking about you know less than a few percent
YOU1000000185_S0000099	that of that that would need to be spent on ah helping get rid of the disease in the entire world
YOU1000000185_S0000100	so it's not like there's some train trade off you know these are very small dollars just like you know the w h o is five hundred million a year
YOU1000000185_S0000101	you know for things like reproductive health vaccines polio covers a a lot of different areas
YOU1000000185_S0000102	and so it's not competing budget-wise with the large-scale resources
YOU1000000185_S0000104	you know your foundation does amazing work we've been lucky to be partners for a long time on some k through twelve education work
YOU1000000185_S0000105	very very grateful to receive that support and amplify that good work and it makes me wonder about how the world is changing in a broader sense
YOU1000000185_S0000106	as a result of this virus i mean what do you i mean melinda let me go to you first what do you think we're gonna see in terms of some lasting changes
YOU1000000185_S0000107	as a result of this health and economic crisis
YOU1000000185_S0000108	well i think that's yet to come and i think you know it's up to us as citizens to rebuild the world that we want
YOU1000000185_S0000109	i think this crisis has expose some of the gaps around the world but particularly in the united states
YOU1000000185_S0000110	and one of those in particular are the gender and the racial inequities that exist
YOU1000000185_S0000111	in terms of gender you know we know that women do two and a half times more work at home than men do and um that's the unpaid labor
YOU1000000185_S0000112	caring for the kids making the lunch making sure their online learning right now
YOU1000000185_S0000113	and so you know it will expose for us that is just way past time that the u s has a paid family medical leave policy we're the only industrialized nation that doesn't
YOU1000000185_S0000114	and if we wanna put people back to work safely and keep their families safe from in from getting sick we need to have paid family medical leave
YOU1000000185_S0000115	and so i think congress in its wisdom and two of the stimulus bills started to address that we need a long-term solution
YOU1000000185_S0000116	the other thing i would say is not only has covid exposed the gaps in the system it's also showed us opportunities like the fact that kids could jump online
YOU1000000185_S0000117	and start learning now unfortunately it's not all kids because many kids didn't have access to a computer or good digital literacy online
YOU1000000185_S0000118	or teachers who knew how to tell each online but we know now it's possible and so i think now we will make sure that technology gets spread equitably
YOU1000000185_S0000119	and those great lesson plans and advising that can happen i think one last example i'll give on digital in the developing world
YOU1000000185_S0000120	there are many many people who have phones and do digital banking on their phone they have access to money on their phone mobile money that was at scale in a number of countries
YOU1000000185_S0000121	but all of a sudden people really said oh my gosh do not have to stand in line for my government payment where i might get sick
YOU1000000185_S0000122	so just to take pakistan alone in forty-eight hours forty million additional people signed up for digital bank account that is an opportunity we can use
YOU1000000185_S0000123	and particularly use to reach low income families and women on that phone with all kinds of things like cash transfers
YOU1000000185_S0000124	more information more information about when health services are available so
YOU1000000185_S0000125	though some of those digital opportunities are really hitting in ways we didn't expect as quickly as we had been had thought they would
YOU1000000185_S0000127	i love that answer because i think there's a lot we're afraid of right now both in terms of health from the economy and how to write this social injustice ship
YOU1000000185_S0000128	and there's a lot we're afraid of and it's nice to think about some optimistic you know outcomes for this too so the other day ah in an interview david rubenstein asked me
YOU1000000185_S0000129	what i had learned about working remotely ah and i admitted to him that i was conducting a lot of interviews without shoes on
YOU1000000185_S0000130	i'm pleading the fifth about my shoeless state at the moment but what if you learned about yourselves in this time and and what has changed about the way that you're working
YOU1000000185_S0000132	what's impressive dead for office work it
YOU1000000185_S0000134	you know partly build you know on the relationships that you built up over time you could actually do quite well in our foundation has an ah
YOU1000000185_S0000136	and nobody's been in the office you know for over three months now and yet our work ah is going on pretty much full speed
YOU1000000185_S0000137	and you know because i'm if all the software i think okay we can make these software platforms even better
YOU1000000185_S0000138	ah you know make it easy to take notes or share things or have side conversations
YOU1000000185_S0000139	but it it's been decent enough to allow a lot to happen and it's certainly gonna accelerate the idea of do we need to travel as much
YOU1000000185_S0000141	you know how good can we make online education how good can we make telemedicine ah
YOU1000000185_S0000142	it it you know it's like ten years of
YOU1000000185_S0000144	progress on those things will get compressed down into just a couple of years
YOU1000000185_S0000146	yeah
YOU1000000185_S0000147	i i would say our lives you know like everybody around the united states have changed substantially um we're incredibly fortunate not to be struggling to put a meal on the table we just are lucky
YOU1000000185_S0000148	um but yes our work lives you know working from home was not something we did as much before ah we're certainly using a lot of microsoft teams and zoom and other things
YOU1000000185_S0000149	um like you suzanne i have changed i've claimed that when i go back to work i will not be wearing heels i am going to wear my tennis shoes because i wear them all the time now
YOU1000000185_S0000150	for every single meeting including right now um and the other thing i would say is i'm not going to travel as much
YOU1000000185_S0000151	i think there will absolutely be meetings i travel for and you know i still think there will be absolutely reasons to go to africa and southeast asia
YOU1000000185_S0000152	but i think conferences can be changed and we're seeing many many people do them online now and so i do think i will travel less which i think will give me more time to just enjoy life
YOU1000000185_S0000153	and take the breaks that i take here in seattle between my zoom meetings ah to step outside a little bit more
YOU1000000185_S0000154	well i don't know that the world can take you guys taking too much time off i think we need your hard work and big hearts for the problems that we're facing
YOU1000000185_S0000155	and you're really kind of has spent this time with us this evening so thank you both very very much
YOU1000000185_S0000156	thanks again thanks for having us
YOU1000000186_S0000002	it is very very rare and this program has been around for a long time to get in my opinion two of the really greatest human beings that we have living on this planet ah
YOU1000000186_S0000003	today and both together and they've never been together before although i've had them individually
YOU1000000186_S0000004	ah and they have so much in common
YOU1000000186_S0000005	um bill gates and aamir khan what do they have in common
YOU1000000186_S0000006	the two of the world's greatest school and college drop-outs number one
YOU1000000186_S0000008	so if you're gonna drop out don't worry
YOU1000000186_S0000010	this is your future
YOU1000000186_S0000011	they are also um in a way moving on to phase two of their lives the new chapter um
YOU1000000186_S0000013	i i can give you a little anecdote when about two years ago um or maybe a little more than that when bill gates was in his phase one of his life
YOU1000000186_S0000014	and we were talking to a lot of software people rather than ah more interesting people like you
YOU1000000186_S0000015	i asked him to give a sound check say one two three four
YOU1000000186_S0000016	and he said one billion two billion three billion
YOU1000000186_S0000018	he was counting notes that now he's counting people being saved by vaccination by vaccines in terms of millions and millions of them
YOU1000000186_S0000019	it's a huge terrific change in your life phase two
YOU1000000186_S0000020	and amir in a way you've also moved from of course you haven't given up your earlier ah acting career
YOU1000000186_S0000021	but you have also moved on to social issues with this most path-breaking television um program which had a huge impact
YOU1000000186_S0000022	and everybody said you're nuts why are you doing this sort of stuff why don't you stick to movies so what motivated what what caused that change
YOU1000000186_S0000023	you know i don't know i think it's ah
YOU1000000186_S0000025	you know i was i was i had a discussion some time back and you know one of the questions asked to my
YOU1000000186_S0000027	what are the what are the
YOU1000000186_S0000029	what are the good qualities that a good n g o should have those questions asked to
YOU1000000186_S0000031	yes
YOU1000000186_S0000032	and he said that one of the good qualities any n g o should have any person who wants to be part of a social you know service should have is that ah
YOU1000000186_S0000034	it's not just the emotion of wanting to do something with somebody else which is in itself a good emotion that you want to do something for someone
YOU1000000186_S0000035	but if you feel that your life is incomplete if you don't
YOU1000000186_S0000036	right
YOU1000000186_S0000037	so you're doing it for yourself really
YOU1000000186_S0000038	right
YOU1000000186_S0000039	of course you are doing it for someone else but i think that that's what is important is and it's something that happens to you if you feel like it doesn't have to happen to you
YOU1000000186_S0000040	but i think in me what grew was that this feeling that i that i needed to for myself to do something where i felt better about myself when i felt i was you know i feel i'm so privileged in so many ways
YOU1000000186_S0000041	and i feel that i really feel that when i see around me people who are not as privileged and i can't just sit by and be comfortable with that
YOU1000000186_S0000042	i i there's a need in me to ah you know reach out and perhaps
YOU1000000186_S0000044	you're lucky to have a position where people will listen you'll
YOU1000000186_S0000046	i'd like it to use it to the best of my abilities
YOU1000000186_S0000048	so i guess that's why i've moved into the space where i have it's for my own emotional or mental you know peace of mind and satisfaction
YOU1000000186_S0000049	and bill gates
YOU1000000186_S0000051	you've also got a little more emotional in phase two
YOU1000000186_S0000052	ah i i i've seen you almost choked up talking about your dad about how your wife motivated you how your dad's your hero and how all this means a little more to your heart than your head
YOU1000000186_S0000053	so what motivated you to make this change
YOU1000000186_S0000055	i think it's very similar i ah i loved my career in software and ah being part of building microsoft the personal computer industry the internet
YOU1000000186_S0000056	ah you know my twenties and thirties i was fanatical
YOU1000000186_S0000057	yeah
YOU1000000186_S0000058	ah and i saw what innovation could do
YOU1000000186_S0000059	ah but there came a point where i thought hey i should turn that work over ah to other people
YOU1000000186_S0000060	and think about how innovation doesn't naturally benefit everyone it doesn't reach down um to the poorest in fact i've gotten a chance to see some of that as i traveled the world
YOU1000000186_S0000061	and as a big believer in innovation i thought okay we we can push it in that direction
YOU1000000186_S0000062	and so it's allowed me to learn a lot of new things
YOU1000000186_S0000063	and i wouldn't be able to do it except for the the lock the visibility the resources that came from that first career
YOU1000000186_S0000064	and i actually used a lot of what i learned then in terms of engaging scientists and driving innovation as fast as we can
YOU1000000186_S0000065	and how important was your life and in this chapter two of your life
YOU1000000186_S0000067	when i first said to my wife that i was considering ah retiring from my full-time work at microsoft ah you know
YOU1000000186_S0000069	are you crazy
YOU1000000186_S0000070	well no she she was careful not to jump on it because she wanted it to be my decision
YOU1000000186_S0000071	yeah
YOU1000000186_S0000072	you know that i would never look back and felt like that wasn't ah that i i really picked the time that i felt comfortable with that because they've been so central to my life
YOU1000000186_S0000073	right
YOU1000000186_S0000074	ah but she was certainly enthused about it during my time at microsoft i'd always had somebody who is
YOU1000000186_S0000076	my key partner paul allen
YOU1000000186_S0000078	steve ballmer as the company became big and complicated
YOU1000000186_S0000079	now in this era it's it's really my wife who is my
YOU1000000186_S0000081	and so we get to do this together
YOU1000000186_S0000082	and great motivator she is a driving force behind a lot of what you do
YOU1000000186_S0000083	absolutely she's very energetic about these things she's actually in malaysia this week at the women deliver conference talking about reproductive health and how women get access to those tools
YOU1000000186_S0000084	so ah she's equally passionate and also had a microsoft where some of the ways we think about measurement and managing people getting the best people
YOU1000000186_S0000085	ah we've got a a common background
YOU1000000186_S0000086	ah i mean ah when bill gates got launched into this phase two he talked to and convinced a lot of billionaires around the world especially warren buffet
YOU1000000186_S0000087	to donate a lot to have been philanthropic and donate to his organization or to other organizations and to do make change
YOU1000000186_S0000088	what about in india we don't see enough of that we've got a great example of
YOU1000000186_S0000090	who you highlighted in your
YOU1000000186_S0000091	yeah in our show we we did ah showcase what mister
YOU1000000186_S0000093	doing and i think he's doing really wonderful work and really we should all take you from that
YOU1000000186_S0000094	and certainly i feel that i mean i do believe that in india there is a lot of philanthropy
YOU1000000186_S0000095	yeah
YOU1000000186_S0000097	huge amounts that we often donate but it's usually to religious
YOU1000000186_S0000098	right
YOU1000000186_S0000099	organizations we donate a lot to religion
YOU1000000186_S0000100	yes
YOU1000000186_S0000101	maybe that is a need in us to try safeguard
YOU1000000186_S0000103	insurance policies
YOU1000000186_S0000104	yeah you know because we feel that if you donate a lot to temples or mosques or you know religious institutions and and that's what i um i see most of the big donations are going so it's not that it's not that we don't donate
YOU1000000186_S0000105	yes
YOU1000000186_S0000106	you donate huge amounts but they're going to religious institutions whereas we don't donate ah you know into education or into health care
YOU1000000186_S0000108	and i personally feel that if you if you you know donate into education and health care
YOU1000000186_S0000110	ah the god up there is going to be really happy
YOU1000000186_S0000112	probably be happier ah so i mean i think that i think it's time that that people who are well off financially in india and who would like to contribute to nation building
YOU1000000186_S0000113	yes
YOU1000000186_S0000114	to building this nation into what it can be and to try to achieve its full potential for the youth for the kids of our country
YOU1000000186_S0000115	and for the for the you know the emotional happiness for all of us then that is one one area that we can really help in
YOU1000000186_S0000116	do you think it's like
YOU1000000186_S0000117	in in donating huge sums into education healthcare and other such things
YOU1000000186_S0000119	rather than just religion
YOU1000000186_S0000120	yeah do you think like you need two hands to clap that's a bit of a failure on the the lack of institutions that they can feel safe that the money is going to the right place
YOU1000000186_S0000121	like if you donate to the prime minister's relief fund you just feel god knows what will happen where it will go part of the budget
YOU1000000186_S0000122	but if you've got something on indian equivalent of the gates foundation or something where you know
YOU1000000186_S0000123	i spend the money here it's not gonna go too much to salaries it's going to go targeted
YOU1000000186_S0000124	i don't agree with that entirely um
YOU1000000186_S0000126	because i feel that while yes we are concerned about you know where are we putting our money
YOU1000000186_S0000127	where we are donating that's a concern which all of us should have certainly but i don't think that you won't find any institution or
YOU1000000186_S0000129	and you you will if you really are interested i i don't think it's
YOU1000000186_S0000131	yeah that's not a sufficient excuse as far as i'm concerned
YOU1000000186_S0000132	so bill gates when you meet indian entrepreneurs ah billionaires are you getting any traction with them that they should also donate and to the second miracle a miracle of say vaccines
YOU1000000186_S0000133	i'm sure that philanthropy in india will continue to grow
YOU1000000186_S0000134	i think there's an awareness that although the government can do a lot ah that there are some things that are innovative
YOU1000000186_S0000135	ah whether its good schools showing the way on that ah the people like
YOU1000000186_S0000137	who i think do an amazing job and i'm sure there's others are out there like that
YOU1000000186_S0000138	ah in agriculture there is
YOU1000000186_S0000140	ah you know getting smart young people getting out there pushing innovative techniques
YOU1000000186_S0000141	ah and so yes philanthropy is going to grow ah the only thing i do is i as people are interested in philanthropy i i share with them how much fun it can be
YOU1000000186_S0000142	ah and talk to them about the fact that as you move from the place that you were successful ah usually in business you're going to feel a little uncomfortable
YOU1000000186_S0000143	because you're gonna be in an area where the measures are not as clear
YOU1000000186_S0000144	and you haven't had the twenty or thirty year period of experience where you're really familiar with the territory
YOU1000000186_S0000145	i you will have to engage with the government at least ah to show the way on certain issues so it it's tricky
YOU1000000186_S0000146	ah i think one of the earliest philanthropists anywhere were was the tata family
YOU1000000186_S0000147	ah they were actually a few years tata's even before rockefeller and ah carnegie
YOU1000000186_S0000148	and i learned a lot from those early foundations ah because they were pretty brilliant at what they did
YOU1000000186_S0000149	yes
YOU1000000186_S0000150	ah and i think the more people give the more awesome creme cheese there are the more it makes other people think okay should i do the same
YOU1000000186_S0000151	and so i i hope
YOU1000000186_S0000153	ah that ten years now we can say that this was the golden era of philanthropy in indian the rest of the world
YOU1000000186_S0000154	and you you do find some traction when you talk to them
YOU1000000186_S0000155	absolutely the interesting discussion is is very strong in fact you know they've been a number of meetings and ah people are finding their way
YOU1000000186_S0000156	that boundary of how you connect and you know show models for the government ah that's take some capacity building is taking place
YOU1000000186_S0000157	ah the u s is in this respect further down the learning curve there's no lack of ah places ah to give
YOU1000000186_S0000158	and some agree the the universities have to reach out a little more and say okay here's a program that you could fund
YOU1000000186_S0000159	they and they should look at how that's happened in the u s ah which is
YOU1000000186_S0000161	very organized beautifully organized universities of america
YOU1000000187_S0000001	so when i was teaching this was one of the tests that i will i will ask you know how you know you're an artist that's the main question and you know
YOU1000000187_S0000002	to known when artist or not is like breathing you don't question breathing you have to breathe otherwise you just die so you breathe so if you wake up in the morning
YOU1000000187_S0000003	and you have some ideas and you have to make them and this become like a kind of almost obsession when you have to create and you have this urge to create you definitely an artist
YOU1000000187_S0000004	but you're not a great artist you're just an artist to be great artist there's all different types of rules and and you really have to
YOU1000000187_S0000005	you have to kind of it's like ah it's like the obsess to you like ah it's like it's nothing else in your mind
YOU1000000187_S0000006	the only advice you ever hear is something you already know and it just gets confirmed if you think of all the advice that you heard fifty million pieces of advice people
YOU1000000187_S0000007	and then maybe three or four pieces of advice you can think of having taken
YOU1000000187_S0000008	when i was really young william burroughs told me um and i was really struggling we never had any money and
YOU1000000187_S0000009	and william the advice that william gave me was build a good name you know keep your name clean
YOU1000000187_S0000010	don't make compromises don't worry about making a bunch of money or being successful be concerned with doing good work
YOU1000000187_S0000011	and make the right choices and protect your work and if you build a good name eventually you know that name will be its own currency
YOU1000000187_S0000012	the only advice i have is probably thing is a lot of young musicians and artists already know is that
YOU1000000187_S0000014	although some of them may have the ambition to be the next um the next jay-z or the next whatever
YOU1000000187_S0000015	whatever it is um the number of those artists are very very small
YOU1000000187_S0000017	um and often the artists who are very successful that way
YOU1000000187_S0000019	um they
YOU1000000187_S0000021	they don't have much flexibility it ah in achieving success they can lose a lot of their creative freedom
YOU1000000187_S0000022	and have to keep making the same thing more or less over and over over again and that if the musician artist ah values their freedom and their
YOU1000000187_S0000023	the ability to be creative then may have to maybe realize that they wont be making
YOU1000000187_S0000025	hundreds of millions of dollars they might be making less money but they might have more artistic satisfaction
YOU1000000187_S0000027	painter photographer filmmaker video artists whatever you do
YOU1000000187_S0000029	nobody else can do that better than you
YOU1000000187_S0000031	i think you know the thing is we're not in in a real kind impart any kind of wisdom to anyone else we're so immersed in the bullshit of our own activities
YOU1000000187_S0000032	to know even how to give anyone advice so
YOU1000000187_S0000034	my advice to younger artists will be something like
YOU1000000187_S0000036	to be very sensitive to where they are in what times and what part of the world and how that
YOU1000000187_S0000038	constitutes their artistic practice their artistic inquiry
YOU1000000187_S0000040	i think the great artist have to be ready to um fail which is not many people do because when youth have success
YOU1000000187_S0000041	in certain way than in the public acceptance of certain way you start somehow involuntary reproducing the same images the same type of work
YOU1000000187_S0000042	but and you are not risking and the real artist you know always change their territories and they go to the land they're never been and their
YOU1000000187_S0000043	this unknown territory and then you can fail and you can risk and did fail actually is what makes this this extra
YOU1000000187_S0000044	you know ready to fail that makes great artist
YOU1000000187_S0000046	so it's not that there isn't a thing to say to artist but a miss there specific thing they're going to hear is
YOU1000000187_S0000048	it's not worth their while listening or you worth your while telling them so i think it has to do specific interaction of the person giving the advice and the person receiving it rather than
YOU1000000187_S0000049	broad nostrils work hard
YOU1000000187_S0000051	do your best do what you like and people will respect you for it it doesn't matter what's subject you take on in the end whatever you do is going to be a self-portrait it will reveal who you are
YOU1000000187_S0000052	if it's arrogant it's about you if it's pretentious that's about you don't think you can escape yourself by your choice of subject matter
YOU1000000187_S0000053	um but there many things like that this term can say but unless someone is needing those words
YOU1000000187_S0000055	that don't get hurt
YOU1000000187_S0000056	make your own way in the world
YOU1000000187_S0000057	that's wrap up warm wrap up warm eat properly sensibly
YOU1000000187_S0000058	don't smoke and find your mom
YOU1000000187_S0000059	find your mom
YOU1000000187_S0000061	i had a very old professor like really which i love very much and he give me two advices he said to me if you're drawing with your right hand
YOU1000000187_S0000062	and you're getting better and better and we can wish it was so that we doing a close eyes
YOU1000000187_S0000064	you can draw anything you want immediately change to the left hand and that is very important advice because because when you become routine that is end of everything
YOU1000000187_S0000065	and the second bit of advice he say to me you know your lifetime you probably will have one good idea if you're a really good artist
YOU1000000187_S0000066	and if you're genius two good ideas and that's it but be careful with them
YOU1000000187_S0000067	don't do anything that somebody else that you know deep in your heart somebody else can do better but do what nobody else can do except for you
YOU1000000187_S0000069	well i think the best advice is is i thinking working with art is working with something that is very fierce very strong very robust
YOU1000000187_S0000071	and
YOU1000000187_S0000073	even though the whole world seems to say that art is fragile should be marginalized it's not important it's counterproductive it's
YOU1000000187_S0000074	you know doesn't belong to the centre of what the what reality is defined as artist should have confidence in the fact that well making
YOU1000000187_S0000076	a drawing on a piece of paper is changing the world
YOU1000000187_S0000078	by definition making art is making the world so it is an unbelievably rewarding thing to be an artist
YOU1000000187_S0000079	and to be full behind that idea as a young artist and to actually see that having chosen live in many perspective strange charts to become an artist
YOU1000000187_S0000080	it's also to have chosen to be a part of the world
YOU1000000187_S0000081	to be a to be an artist actually to be a human being in these times its all difficult you have to go through life hopefully
YOU1000000187_S0000082	you know trying to stay healthy you know being as happy as you can and and and perusing you know doing what you want if
YOU1000000187_S0000083	what you want is to have children if what you want is to be a baker if what you want is to live out in the woods or try to save the environment
YOU1000000187_S0000084	or maybe what you want is to write script for detective shows it doesn't really matter you know what matters is to be is to know what you want
YOU1000000187_S0000085	and pursue it and understand that it's gonna be hard because life is really difficult
YOU1000000187_S0000086	you're gonna lose people you love you're gonna suffer heartbreak sometimes you'll be sick sometimes you'll have a really bad toothache
YOU1000000187_S0000087	sometimes you'll be hungry but on the other end you'll have the most beautiful experiences sometimes just the sky

YOU1000000187_S0000089	there is beautiful things in life so when you're suffering just you know its part of the package you know you look at it we're born

YOU1000000189_S0000000	today we're visiting true garden it's a vertical aeroponic food farm i was really excited to go here
YOU1000000189_S0000001	because i originally stumbled across true garden and their farm on instagram and it's so cool looking it's just a series of columns
YOU1000000189_S0000002	that are covered in different vegetables and fruits that are completely fresh and i was mostly interested to see
YOU1000000189_S0000003	what the biology of growing food was like because vertical farms grow food in a very different and sustainable way
YOU1000000189_S0000004	my name's troy albright i'm actually a licensed pharmacist as i've done consult on with my patients i realize it starts with the food they're putting in their body
YOU1000000189_S0000005	troy is a licensed pharmacist by trade he went through school in a very modern medical way of doing things
YOU1000000189_S0000006	and through the process of having children of his own with their own illnesses and conditions and also being overweight himself
YOU1000000189_S0000007	he changed how he approached food and what he put in his body and it changed everything for him in his family
YOU1000000189_S0000008	my parents and grandparents were farmers in minnesota and we had black soil there here in arizona the soil is like this red clay stuff
YOU1000000189_S0000009	sure
YOU1000000189_S0000010	so if you don't amend it and really work that soil you don't get a lot of good quality produce out of it so when i saw the tower garden i can control the environment
YOU1000000189_S0000011	i control the water i control the nutrients i love this i can control every aspect of growing my own food
YOU1000000189_S0000012	so how does this whole process work basically the first step is to put whatever seeds you want into the coconut core
YOU1000000189_S0000013	this grow medium here is coco core it's actually a certified organic grow medium and it's a by product of coconut husk and you throw it put your seeds in there
YOU1000000189_S0000014	and then once they're one to two inches tall like this then we can come over here and and just plant these right in here they fit right in the in the pod
YOU1000000189_S0000015	you throw it in the pump turns on every three to fifteen minutes depending on the program pumps the water and the nutrient solution all the way up to the top and then just using the law of physics
YOU1000000189_S0000016	yeah
YOU1000000189_S0000017	what goes up comes down right
YOU1000000189_S0000018	yeah
YOU1000000189_S0000019	and it just rains down there's a shower cap rains down and hits all these spots
YOU1000000189_S0000020	so something i find interesting is that you only need that amount of soil
YOU1000000189_S0000021	right
YOU1000000189_S0000022	like you ambushing just miles and miles of dirt and soil to grow plants but you only need that at now
YOU1000000189_S0000023	yep that's all i need
YOU1000000189_S0000024	for every different plant that you're growing
YOU1000000189_S0000025	ah nope just that small amount it's actually not even soil it's coconut husk if we use soil we'd have a lot more bugs we'd have to use pesticides and herbicides and fungicides i choose not to use any of those here
YOU1000000189_S0000026	organic is what that's clean yep just food
YOU1000000189_S0000027	yeah
YOU1000000189_S0000028	do you think that's really happening today
YOU1000000189_S0000029	well by the way you just said that now
YOU1000000189_S0000031	vegetables typically that are transported into your state by law even if they're organic are sprayed with pesticides
YOU1000000189_S0000032	so that's not ideal
YOU1000000189_S0000033	the problem is our soils are depleted there the f d a has lots of studies showing that when those leafy greens are cut and travel what on average twelve hundred to fifteen hundred miles to get to your plate
YOU1000000189_S0000034	they come across pesticides
YOU1000000189_S0000035	yeah pesticides are there ah fifty percent less nutrients they've lost up to fifty percent in some cases there's hardly any nutritional value
YOU1000000189_S0000037	here look at some of this basil ah let's grab a beautiful basil point you pull this out look at those beautiful roots on there
YOU1000000189_S0000038	oh my gosh
YOU1000000189_S0000039	i mean look at that
YOU1000000189_S0000040	that's insane
YOU1000000189_S0000041	this is twenty-one days old yeah
YOU1000000189_S0000042	the vegetables that we saw at true garden were just growing right there there was no soil there was minimal water
YOU1000000189_S0000043	it was really just their roots hanging in these hollow tubes being saturated in nutrients and substances and growing to be the most beautiful vegetables
YOU1000000189_S0000044	i mean if we pull one out here it's like a beautiful bouquet let's get one out of here so you can see i mean the the roots and you got these beautiful
YOU1000000189_S0000045	now i know what my bouquets gonna be for my wedding
YOU1000000189_S0000046	yes
YOU1000000189_S0000047	oh my gosh it is so soft
YOU1000000189_S0000048	yeah isn't that something once you try a piece of that
YOU1000000189_S0000049	vegetables have a much more vibrant and bolder and fuller flavor then i think most of us have experienced
YOU1000000189_S0000050	feel like it tastes different than what i'm used like i feel like most romaine lettuce taste so watered down
YOU1000000189_S0000051	summer's over this is even better
YOU1000000189_S0000052	sweeter i don't feel like i've ever tasted romaine that was this sweet it's stronger it's more unique from vegetable to vegetable
YOU1000000189_S0000053	because you're not getting that dirt flavor a lot of that comes from growing the fruit or vegetable in this coconut husk
YOU1000000189_S0000054	and feeding it with these nutrient substances without any soil it's amazing
YOU1000000189_S0000055	i don't know how i haven't eaten vegetables this fresh before and i feel like everyone needs to like i buy expensive freaking spinach at the store
YOU1000000189_S0000056	all organic everything i i whole paycheck at whole foods it happens but it doesn't taste like this
YOU1000000189_S0000057	well whey grow most spinach in sand so a lot of times when you crunch on spinach
YOU1000000189_S0000058	you got like a grainy taste to that
YOU1000000189_S0000059	that's the sand that they grow it in so you always wanna rinse it well and get rid of that
YOU1000000189_S0000060	one of the the craziest things i tried was the stevia leaf
YOU1000000189_S0000061	here try just a piece of this just a real just a really small amount
YOU1000000189_S0000065	what is that
YOU1000000189_S0000066	it's a natural plant sweetener
YOU1000000189_S0000067	i just wanna eat this as like an after dinner dessert and then i will never eat ice cream again
YOU1000000189_S0000068	isn't that isn't that so sweet isn't it
YOU1000000189_S0000069	yeah i have had the stevia powder but never a stevia leaf oh that is stevia
YOU1000000189_S0000070	this is the actual stevia plant here
YOU1000000189_S0000071	wow that's amazing you could use it in so many things and it is so powerful i also tried a mint chocolate herb
YOU1000000189_S0000072	and it tasted just like mint chocolate
YOU1000000189_S0000073	so once we have a sprout we put it in the tower twenty-six days later you have that things grow so fast
YOU1000000189_S0000074	twenty-six days
YOU1000000189_S0000075	yes
YOU1000000189_S0000077	so what happens is you get accelerated growth because the roots can get a lot of oxygen
YOU1000000189_S0000079	since there's no soil there's no weeds which is amazing because puling weeds is literally the worst weekend activity ever
YOU1000000189_S0000080	vertical farming it's just your head of lettuce or your kale or your spinach or your berries or your tomatoes no bugs no weeds
YOU1000000189_S0000081	what is the actual benefit of having a vertical farm versus having a normal farm that we're used in
YOU1000000189_S0000082	big part of this with the vertical farm we're really saving on space we can use ninety percent less land but we can grow ninety percent more food
YOU1000000189_S0000083	when you go brook like this this is one tenth of an acre we can grow ten times more food as a result of going vertical
YOU1000000189_S0000084	plus our resources we use ninety to ninety-eight percent less water that's huge i mean what three percent of the water in the in the world is fresh water
YOU1000000189_S0000085	so it's not just a commodity here in the united states but all over the world having fresh water so we got to really conserve our resources and if we don't
YOU1000000189_S0000086	we're setting ourselves up for a major catastrophe
YOU1000000189_S0000087	how many people do you think you could feed like just out of this space
YOU1000000189_S0000088	out of this space we could easily speed um gosh ah ah hundred families on a weekly basis
YOU1000000189_S0000089	wow as we all know our world is changing the land available to us is changing the quality soil that we have on our earth is changing
YOU1000000189_S0000090	and this may be the most sustainable way to feed our communities moving forward if someone watch this video and wanted to start gardening tomorrow or today
YOU1000000189_S0000091	what would be like your top three tips for doing that
YOU1000000189_S0000092	grow the things you love to eat keep it simple use clean water use good quality seedlings we've got residential models
YOU1000000189_S0000093	as well as commercial farms
YOU1000000189_S0000094	residential model
YOU1000000189_S0000095	so the residential model is about five or six feet tall just like you are and um one to two towers could easily feed a family of four depending on what you're growing
YOU1000000189_S0000096	you're gonna be exposed to less chemicals you'll love it you'll really love it
YOU1000000189_S0000097	i was a skeptic i absolutely thought the biology of this food must be different if we're not making it with soil and the same amount of water
YOU1000000189_S0000098	and the same amount of sunlight as the vegetables and fruits we're used to but the matter of the fact is it's better it's got more nutrients more minerals
YOU1000000189_S0000099	it's more dense in the rich vitamins that your body needs and it's just more environmentally friendly
YOU1000000189_S0000100	you know as a compounding pharmacist i do consults and i got into this because i really saw not just my own kids but my own patients that were missing the food part
YOU1000000189_S0000101	they were missing that nutrition part and as i corrected nutrition in them i'm like i'm like this changed their whole life
YOU1000000189_S0000102	we were taught in pharmacy school just give a drug give a drug give a drug drugs are just band-aids they don't cure us if if you don't have good nutrition
YOU1000000189_S0000103	that foundation that we're building our body on isn't there and so that leads to all sorts of things you know depression leaky gut your gum disease
YOU1000000189_S0000104	people that are constantly having headaches and they're not growing properly or kids don't grow properly cause of nutrition so start with good foundation
YOU1000000189_S0000105	if you have a good good foundation with nutrition eat it what you grow or buy it locally you're gonna be way healthier
YOU1000000189_S0000106	so crazy how your diet can affect pretty much everything it's hard to put into a sentence how cool and interesting i thought this whole experience was
YOU1000000189_S0000107	i've always been a firm believer in what you put in your body matters and the food you put in your body matters
YOU1000000189_S0000108	and we are allowing food industries to spray it with pesticides to transport it super far change its enzymes and nutritional benefits
YOU1000000189_S0000109	so that when we're receiving the food it's not even giving us the fuel that we need to survive in a healthy way
YOU1000000189_S0000110	the body is an incredible piece of equipment machinery you put good stuff in it gets good stuff out you put bad stuff in in time bad stuff would come out
YOU1000000189_S0000111	but you can't correct it it just takes some some effort on our part to do what's right who said that hippocrates you are what you eat but food be medicine not medicine be food
YOU1000000189_S0000112	he said a lot more eloquently but ah you know i firmly believe that
YOU1000000189_S0000113	true garden was quite possibly one have of the most beautiful things i have ever seen it was pristine it was green
YOU1000000189_S0000114	not fake green not sprayed on green it was beautiful vibrant green
YOU1000000189_S0000115	and the oxygen in that greenhouse i would like to one day live in a greenhouse with that pure oxygen
YOU1000000189_S0000116	i'm really grateful for the opportunity to learn about my health to learn about my food and also to share the information with you guys
YOU1000000189_S0000118	in hopes that it maybe changes one thing you don't have to change everything overnight do one thing that will make you better tomorrow than you are today
YOU1000000189_S0000120	thank you guys so much for watching it was one of my favorite videos to make and share with you all if you care about health and wellness and wanna learn more
YOU1000000189_S0000121	you should definitely watch our tutorial on how to make natural cleaning supplies because what you spray around in the air around you matters too
YOU1000000191_S0000000	so we're gonna get this play all they way down ah when that i'm awaked this morning
YOU1000000191_S0000001	good morning everyone if you have not already don't forget to hit the subscribe button ring that bell
YOU1000000191_S0000002	videos every tuesday and friday at odd occasion we do this sunday video what is going on i'm gonna take a couple of polls
YOU1000000191_S0000003	today's video i am walking into my cow field we have moved the electric fence back into this field and we're gonna look at something very exciting we're doing something very exciting today
YOU1000000191_S0000004	you'd have seen when we put the cow brush back up in january it was very wet it was very horrible
YOU1000000191_S0000005	it was gross but the cows loved the cow brush
YOU1000000191_S0000007	currently have two cows who fight over brush surely this means i need another one
YOU1000000191_S0000009	they absolutely loved it you'd seen them using it all the time this is in the past couple of weeks
YOU1000000191_S0000010	and the guys at mayo cow comfort and finneasy who'd like to send me another cow brush
YOU1000000191_S0000011	but this cow brush is something different a cow brush that goes into the field
YOU1000000191_S0000012	so obviously our cows are happily grazing we have about
YOU1000000191_S0000014	ten standing up and over hundred and ten are chilling out bellies full of grass
YOU1000000191_S0000015	getting a bit of that sun our plan is they are going to send me a cow brush that goes into the field which is great
YOU1000000191_S0000016	so instead of using my brand new fences that we did for a viewing area back in the farm shop we are gonna use a cow brush which is gonna be fantastic
YOU1000000191_S0000017	i was thinking of putting it in with the highlands that are in the paddock there but then i thought why give it to highlands when there's only four
YOU1000000191_S0000018	when we've got hundred and twenty-three i think in the moment in the milking hood
YOU1000000191_S0000019	why don't we put it here so it's gonna get used literally twenty-two times more
YOU1000000191_S0000020	desmondo is coming soon and we're gonna find a position to put it up
YOU1000000191_S0000021	i'm gonna guess here cause i want to have it in area where the cows can use it people can see it from farm shop when they come out of the farm shop and they see the viewing area though
YOU1000000191_S0000022	horse and the highland might be something else coming as well but yes very exciting so that's the idea
YOU1000000191_S0000023	i'm gonna put a white pole to say this is where i would like it
YOU1000000191_S0000024	this is the position and desmondo's coming in early desmondo imagine you're a normal human can you see this here this is me pretending to be a cow brush
YOU1000000191_S0000025	there's yeah
YOU1000000191_S0000027	all we're doing now is we're gonna wait for mayo cow comforts to come
YOU1000000191_S0000029	so we had two positions and i think your ride does take that one out
YOU1000000191_S0000030	it's a little bit further away
YOU1000000191_S0000031	desmondo's always right
YOU1000000191_S0000032	ah
YOU1000000191_S0000033	just to accept it
YOU1000000191_S0000034	not very calm with it

YOU1000000191_S0000133	thank you to finneasy and mayo cow comfort for coming
YOU1000000191_S0000134	and installing a cow brush if they saw that the cows loved in this back shed and they um they have brought one for my outside because we know these cows are outside
YOU1000000191_S0000135	for six months a year as well it it's part of their range again it needs no power
YOU1000000191_S0000136	it can live inside it can pressure wash outside and what you can do as well is you can unbolt the base of it
YOU1000000191_S0000137	and then we can put it into the concrete area so if you gotta large out a large area where cows kind of roam a free roaming and loafing area
YOU1000000191_S0000138	if you wanna be technical you can place it inside for the other six months when the cows do come inside so it's very versatile
YOU1000000191_S0000139	perfect for us we don't have the space to put this inside currently but who knows things could change and cows straight on it
